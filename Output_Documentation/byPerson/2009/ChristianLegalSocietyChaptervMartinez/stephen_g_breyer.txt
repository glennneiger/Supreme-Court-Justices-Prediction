justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
this
say
the
opposite?
it
says
we
are
--
you
have
to
let
anybody
in
--
anybody
--
regardless
of
their
status
or
beliefs.
so
you
can't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
status
or
belief.
that's
what
the
policy
says
i
just
read.
it
doesn't
say
you
can;
it
says
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
you
say,
but
that's
not
what
the
policy
says.
the
policy
says
that
you
have
to
let
everybody
in,
regardless
of
their
status
or
belief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
cannot
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
status
or
belief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
have
to
--
you
have
to
let
these
organizations
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
belief.
and
they
say:
no,
we
don't
want
to;
that's
too
complicated
for
us
to
figure
out
which
ones
we
should,
which
ones
we
shouldn't.
we'd
rather
let
them
work
off-campus.
we
just
don't
want
to
get
into
this
business.
it's
not
just
against
religion.
it
might
be
against
a
turkish-speaking
society
that
thinks
turkish
is
extremely
important
to
speak
or
a
chess
club
that
thinks
the
same.
it
could
be
a
lot
of
people.
now,
why
do
you
--
what's
wrong
with
us,
a
first
amendment
--
an
organization
itself
affected
with
first
amendment
interests,
saying
we
just
don't
want
to
have
those
on
campus
organizations,
too
much
trouble.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
their
way
of
doing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
make
an
imaginary
example,
and
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
--
if
a
homosexual
person
said,
i
want
to
belong
to
this
club,
and
i
believe
in
its
principles,
i
don't
believe
in
sexual
relationships
before
marriage,
and
that's
why
i
want
to
work
for
homosexual
marriage,
which
i
do,
so
my
consistency
there,
is
that
person
--
i
am
consistent
in
what
i
work
for,
what
i
believe,
and
on
--
as
far
as
premarital
sex
is
concerned,
it's
totally
100
percent
with
your
organization
that
you
are
representing;
would
they
admit
that
person
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
shares
the
belief
that
there
should
be
no
premarital
sex--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
he
says
that's
why
i
am
working
for
proposition
8
or
whatever
the
proposition,
or
against
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
working
to
legalize
homosexual
marriage
in
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
they
would
not
--
the
answer
is
no,
that
person--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
he's
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
his
sexual
conduct--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
will
refrain
until
marriage
is
made
lawful--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--at
which
point
he
intends
to
engage
in
sexual
conduct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
we
have
is
a
rule,
a
stipulation.
and
as
i
read
it,
to
try
to
make
sense
out
of
it,
it
does
seem
to
discriminate
against
organizations
in
respect
to
which
intellectual
purity
would
be
important.
they're
going
to
have
a
harder
time.
the
ones
that
don't
care
that
much
will
have
an
easier
time.
now,
in
trying
to
judge
the
constitutionality
of
that,
i
first
have
no
idea
which
these
organizations
are.
we've
got
one
of
them,
but
there
may
be
a
lot
of
others.
i
don't
know
if
the
democratic
club
is
or
is
not.
i
don't
know
how
big
the
tent
they
want.
i
don't
know
whether
the
turkish
society
even
exists.
i
don't
know
how
the
chess
club
feels
about
players
of
tiddlywinks.
[laughter]
so
i
have
an
absolute
void
in
this
record,
which
in
turn
i
think
would
be
important
to
fill
that
void,
because
their
justification--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
they
don't
want
to
get
into
this,
it's
too
complicated,
and
we're
not
doing
that
much
harm
to
them
because
they
can
meet
off-campus,
and
it's
a
big,
disruptive
influence,
all
of
these
things.
and
then
sneaking
in
here
is
this
anti-gay
bias
issue,
and
--
and
they
want
to
say:
that
isn't
much,
because
that
isn't
really
the
point
here,
and
that's
what
we
think,
anyway.
it's
just
an
example
of
something.
so
with
that
great
unclarity,
asked
to
decide
a
constitutional
issue
where
i
feel
i'd
need
more
facts
and
i
don't
have
them--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
more
justification
to
know
what
it
really
is,
which
i
don't
have,
what
should
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
supposed
to
happen?
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this.
hastings,
let's
say,
or
berkeley
has
four
or
five
or
six
different
religious
chapels
for
services
on
sunday
or
saturday,
and
they
say
we're
open
to
all
branches
of
religion,
orthodox
jews,
conservative,
and
reformed.
and
then
the
orthodox
say
we
want
men
and
women
to
sit
separately.
now,
can
hastings
say
or
berkeley,
no,
we'll
let
the
reform
come,
we'll
let
the
conservatives
come,
but
not
the
--
not
the
orthodox
jews.
they
can't
have
their
service.
would
--
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what
is
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if,
in
fact,
the
--
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
have
clubs
and
they're
not
services,
and
what
they
do
is
they
discuss
--
they
discuss
the
--
the
nature
of
the
service,
and
there
can
they
have
separate
discussions--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--men
from
--
men
and
women?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
your
answer
to
that
is
the
orthodox
jews
cannot.
they
cannot
have
separate
women's
groups
in
their
organization,
which
is
an
after
religious
school
organization.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
outside
of
the
university,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
their
problem
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
their
reason
to
put
in
a
sentence
as
to
why
they
don't
want
these
orthodox
jews
to
meet
separately
on
the
campus
--
men
in
one
group,
women
in
another
--
and
discuss
the
religious
service
--
they
want
none
like
that,
and
their
reason
for
wanting
none
like
that
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
trying
to
make
it
as
close
as
possible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
have
a
small
orthodox
club.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
totally,
if
--
but
it's
imaginary,
it's
fantastical.
the
--
you
could
imagine
a
school
in
the
'60s
that
said
that
we
think
the
way
to
advance
learning
is
everyone
gets
together
in
a
nice
discussion
group
and
hugs
each
other
and
talks,
all
right?
[laughter]
now,
that's
a
possible
educational
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
say
that
we
are
going
to
apply
that
to
everybody
because
that's
how
we
do
it.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
there
are
any
ideological
organizations
that
suffer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
be
it,
but
it's
fantastical,
and
therefore--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my
question
is,
if
i
can
think
of
this
policy
--
but
i
tend
to
sympathize
with
your
view
that
it's
so
hard
to
believe
that
they
really
hold
it,
maybe
they
do,
i
don't
know
about
it
--
what
do
i
do
with
this
case?
how
can
i
say
whether
this,
let's
call
it
"hug
your
neighbor
policy"
is
--
to
put
a
label
on
it
that's
catchy--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
do
i
--
how
do
i
evaluate
that?
