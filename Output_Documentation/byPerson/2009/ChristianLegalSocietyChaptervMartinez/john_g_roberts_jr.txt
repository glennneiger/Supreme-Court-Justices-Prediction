chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1371,
christian
legal
society
chapter
of
the
university
of
california
--
hastings
v.
martinez.
mr.
mcconnell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
mcconnell.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
why
do
you
have--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why
do
you
have
a
policy,
a
written
policy
--
you
don't
have
a
written
policy
that
says
anything
about
all-comers.
you've
got
a
written
policy
that
says
you
can
--
you
can't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
only
one
type
of
belief,
religious
belief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
why
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
this
nondiscrimination
policy
no
longer
on
the
books?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
say
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
--
so
you're
saying
the
second
paragraph
is
totally
unnecessary.
you
say
the
first
paragraph
says
you
can't
discriminate
on
any
basis,
and
the
second
paragraph
spells
out
the
basis.
so
why
do
you
do
have
the
second
paragraph?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
--
they
quite
--
quote
the
bylaws
of
the
national
lawyers
guild,
which
says
any
member
must
"agree
with
the
objectives
of
the
organization
as
set
forth
herein.
"
that's
not
all-comers.
that's
a
bylaw
that
restricts
an
organization
according
to
its
--
members
can't
join
unless
they
sign
on
the
dotted
line
that
they
believe
in
objectives
of
the
organization.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
got
nothing
to
do
with
sexual
--
well,
i
don't
know
the
national
lawyers
guild,
but
they
say
you
have
got
to
agree
with
the
objectives
of
the
organization.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
start
with
mine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
is
continually
evolving
wherever
the
first
amendment
pressure
comes.
you've
got
a
written
nondiscrimination
policy.
and
then
you
say,
well,
yes,
but
we
use
an
all-comers
policy.
you've
got
an
all-comers
policy,
and
then
groups
don't
actually
follow
the
all-comers
policy,
and
you
have
another
answer
to
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
go
with
--
why
shouldn't
we
go
with
the
written
policy
and
the
written
bylaws?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
you're
talking
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--la
raza
background.
as
i
understand
it,
the
la
raza
organization
says
you
have
to
be
of
la
raza
background
to
be
a
policy
member
of
the
organization.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
have
a
law
that
says
every
newspaper
that's
published
in
the
united
states
must
be
reviewed
every
day
by
the
government's
censor
board,
and
the
fact
that
the
government's
censor
board
decides
not
to
do
it,
then
that
law
is
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
newspaper
sues
saying
that
law
is
constitutional,
and
we'll
say
it's
all
right;
it
has
never
been
applied?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
because
they
might
adopt
a
different
policy.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
future
different
policy
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
going
to
help
if
you
have
the
50
anti-muslim
students
who
want
to
take
over
the
group.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
they
take
over
the
group
and
the
first
thing
they
do
is
say
we're
abolishing
the
attendance
policy.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
that's
because
gender
or
race
is
fundamentally
different
from
religious
belief.
gender
and
race
is
a
status.
religious
belief
--
it
has
to
be
based
on
the
fundamental
notion
that
we
are
not
open
to
everybody.
we
have
beliefs,
you
have
to
subscribe
to
them.
and
we've
always
regarded
that
as
a
good
thing.
that
type
of
exclusion
is
supported
in
--
in
the
constitution.
the
other
types
of
exclusion
are
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
phrase
it
that
way.
it's
a
group
that
wants
to
exclude
--
a
religious
group,
a
religious-oriented
group,
that
wants
to
exclude
people
who
do
not
subscribe
to
their
religious
beliefs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
--
that's
pretty
tough.
that
has
no
connection
to
merit.
i
assume
there
are
groups
that
think
subscribing
to
their
beliefs
is
evidence
of
merit,
particularly
religious
groups.
so,
how
can
you
have
a
--
a
test
that
allows
distinctions
based
on
merit
but
not
--
not
beliefs?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry.
all
parties
do
not
agree
that
the
policy
is
the
all-comers
policy.
your
friend
argued
repeatedly
that
the
policy
was
the
written
nondiscrimination
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg
concerning
california
law,
is
it
your
position
that
california
law
requires
religious
groups
to
admit
people
who
do
not
believe
in
their
religious
beliefs
and
in
fact
to
conduct
services
of
that
group?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
answer
to
my
question
is
"yes"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mcconnell,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
mcconnell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
08-1371
christian
legal
society
versus
martinez.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
