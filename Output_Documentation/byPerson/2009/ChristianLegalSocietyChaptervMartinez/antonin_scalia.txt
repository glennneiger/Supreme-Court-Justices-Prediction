but
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
one
--
isn't
the
all-comers
policy
broader
than
the
nondiscrimination
policy,
so
that
if
you
comply
with
that
you
automatically
comply
with
everything
in
the
nondiscrimination
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
--
but
the
latter,
the
nondiscrimination
policy,
you
assert
is
--
is
not
viewpoint
neutral,
that
it
has
a
particular
impact
upon
a
religious
organization;
whereas,
the
other
policy,
the
all-comers
policy,
applies
to
everybody,
and
that
argument
is
not
available
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
should
--
if
that
was
it
you
should
have
brought
in
some
--
some
evidence
of
different
treatment
of
other
groups.
and
there
--
as
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
is
none
of
that
except
your
citation
of
the
bylaws
of
two
groups
in
your
brief,
as
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
wish
you
would.
you
are
going
to
waste
your
whole
time
just
discussing
this
stipulation
point.
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
latter
is
the
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
student
organization,
i
suppose,
of
that
type.
it
wouldn't
include
many
people.
but
if
there
were
such
an
organization,
i
assume
that
they
would
have
that
--
that
belief
required,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
--
where
is
the
stipulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute
now.
a
diversity--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
--
this
was
not
the
policy
on
the
basis
of
which
cls
was
excluded;
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
--
when
they
were
refused
participation
in
the
--
in
the
student
organization
program,
they
were
not
told
about
the
all-comers
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
anyway,
as
i
understand
your
argument
on
the
all-comers
policy,
it
is
not
an
argument
that
--
that
is
based
upon
the
religious
nature
of
cls.
you
would
make
the
same
argument
of
unconstitutionality
with
respect
to
the
student
republican
club,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
was
the
basis
--
your
distinction
between
status
and
belief
was
the
basis
for
your
saying
that
the
original
policy,
whatever
--
whatever
we
call
it
--
what
is
the
name
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
written
policy
--
when
it
forbids
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
was
complied
with
by
cls
because
it
would
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
orientation,
only
on
the
basis
of
belief.
justice
antonin
scalia
cls
doesn't
have
any
--
any
belief
that
marriage
is
between
a
man
and
a
woman?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
wants
to
marry--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
an
implementation
of
the
nondiscrimination
policy.
i
mean,
the
two
policies
are
quite
different.
now,
are
you
telling
us
that
the
written
policy
is
no
longer
operative?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
what?
no,
it's
not
operative
or
no,
you're
not
telling
me
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
stipulated
that
the
policy
exists.
they
didn't
stipulate
that
it
is
--
is
being
faithfully
applied
by
hastings.
what
do
you
do
about
the
--
the
--
the
two
organizations'
bylaws
referred
to
in
the
--
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
which
clearly
do
--
conflict
with
the
so-called
all-comers
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
the
bylaws--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
don't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
--
the
two
are
connected,
though,
mr.
garre.
frankly,
one
reason
why
i
am
inclined
to
think
this
is
pretextual
is
that
it
is
so
weird
to
require
the
--
the
campus
republican
club
to
admit
democrats,
not
just
to
membership,
but
to
officership.
to
require
this
christian
society
to
allow
atheists
not
just
to
join,
but
to
conduct
bible
classes,
right?
that's
crazy.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
there
any
other
university
in
the
country
that
has
this
kind
of
a
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait,
wait.
twenty
years?
do
you
have
any
evidence
that
this
policy,
the
one
we're
arguing
about
now,
that
is
to
say,
the
all-comers
policy,
existed
before
cls
brought
this
litigation?
as
i
recall,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
a
letter
from
the
dean
describing
this
policy
after
the
litigation
began.
justice
antonin
scalia
teach
bible
classes?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
let
them
teach
bible
classes,
too,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
yes,
let's
get
back
to
this
homosexual
orientation.
you
say
that
that's
established
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
about
number
2,
the
--
the
so-called
line-drawing
problem?
aren't
you
just
letting
yourself
into
even
more
line-drawing
problems?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
other
--
it's
whether
you
were
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
one
of
the
forbidden
bases.
but
now
you're
saying
you
can't
discriminate
on
any
basis,
which
means
there're
going
to
be
even
more
lines
to
have
to
draw.
why
does
it
solve
your
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
talk
about
--
i
had
understood
from
your
brief
that
cls
did
not
have
a
--
a
policy
of
excluding
people
with
homosexual
disposition,
but
that
it
was
only
homosexual
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
--
but
your
complaint
said
otherwise.
your
--
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
okay.
