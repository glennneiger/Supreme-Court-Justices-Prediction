but,
mr.
mcconnell,
justice
scalia
had
just
made
the
point
that
the
all-comers
policy
overwhelms
the
other,
so
that
i
would
like
you
to
deal
up
front
with
the
all-comers
policy
that
the
dean
in
her
deposition
said,
loud
and
clear:
"our
policy
is
all-comers.
"
"yes,
republicans
have
to
be
admitted
to
the
democratic
group
and
vice
versa.
"
so
unless
you
are
challenging
the
veracity
of
the
dean
after
stipulating,
as
you
did,
that
all-comers
is
the
policy,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
listen
to
your
argument
about
the
so-called
written
policy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
mcconnell,
here
is
a
statement,
a
stipulation.
it's
a
stipulation
for
summary
judgment.
it
says:
district
judge,
you
take
this
to
be
the
fact:
hastings
requires
that
registered
student
organizations
allow
any
student
to
participate,
become
a
member,
seek
leadership
positions
in
the
organization.
that
is
not
qualified.
it
says:
district
judge,
here
are
the
facts
that
we
stipulate.
it
doesn't
say
this
is
what
the
dean
says,
but
it's
not
really
enforced.
it's
not
qualified
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
hastings
takes
the
position
that
it's
all
in
favor
of
diversity,
not
only
among
the
groups
but
within
the
groups.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
is
that
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
say,
yes,
we
believe
in
diversity
among
groups,
but
we
also
believe
in
diversity
within
the
group;
that's
a
good
thing.
they
are
not
backing
off
from:
we
think
diversity
among
groups
is
fine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
may
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
may
be
an
ill-advised
policy,
but
the
school
says:
it's
our
policy.
it's
working
fine,
and
all
the
--
the
hypotheticals
about
sabotage,
takeover,
they
haven't
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mcconnell,
let's
say
it
is
the
belief
of
this
group,
based
on
their
reading
of
the
bible,
that
only
white
men
can
lead
the
bible
studies,
can
become
officers
of
the
group,
and
that's
based
on
their
fundamental
belief
that
that's
what
the
bible
instructs.
on
your
view,
must
hastings
give
this
organization
status
as
a
recognized
student
organization?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
belief
is
--
this
is
the
belief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
they
--
they
would
have
to
negate
their
belief
in
their
practice.
they
could
believe
this,
but
they
couldn't
implement
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
mr.
garre,
you
did
say
that
the
evidence
is
the
dean's
deposition.
there's
no
prior
evidence.
but
there
are
schools,
including
law
schools,
that
have
this
policy.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
also
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
university's
across-the-board
rules
for
all
student
conduct
against
disruption,
against
incivility.
the
list
would
certainly
carry
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
predecessor
group.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
--
was
there
any
proof
in
this
record?
i
mean,
there's
a
stipulation
for
summary
judgment.
was
there
any
proof
showing
that
it
wasn't
evenly
applied?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
the
--
the
so-called
written
policy,
that
has
a
--
that
list
has
a
correspondence
to
the
state's
law,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
categories
that
are
listed
there
are
the
categories
that
under
california
law
are
proscribed
bases
for
discrimination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mcconnell--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
mcconnell,
you
don't
challenge
that
there
are
universities,
including
four
law
schools,
that
have
an
all-comers
policy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
private
universities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
presents
a
novel
first
amendment
question,
may
a
public
law
school
condition
official
recognition
of
a
student
group,
on
the
group’s
agreement
to
open
membership
to
all
students,
who
want
to
join.
we
hold
that
a
law
school
may
maintain
such
an
open
access
policy
to
meet
first
amendment
measurement
the
school
need
not
provide
a
religion
based
exception.
respondent
hastings
college
of
law
is
a
state
operated
law
school,
part
of
the
university
of
california
system.
hastings
extends
official
recognition
to
student
groups
through
its
“registered
student
organization”
or
rso
program.
several
benefits
attend
rso
status,
prime
advantages
of
rso
qualification
in
addition
to
access
to
school
facilities
and
methods
of
communicating
with
students.
there
are
subsidies
for
the
organizations
events.
this
funding
comes
from
mandatory,
student
activities
fees,
imposed
without
exception,
on
all
students.
to
gain
recognition,
rso’s
must
agree
to
comply
with
hastings
nondiscrimination
policy,
that
policy
tracking
california
law,
bars
discrimination
on
several
bases
including
religion
and
sexual
orientation.
hastings
interprets
the
policy
to
require
rso’s
to
accept
all-comers.
for
example,
as
the
parties
have
stipulated
to
be
true,
a
democratic
group
cannot
exclude
students
holding
republican
political
police.
hastings
policy
is
not
unique,
other
law
schools,
for
example,
georgetown
university
law
center
adhere
to
similar
all-comers
policies.
at
the
beginning
of
the
2004
academic
year,
petitioner
christian
legal
society
or
cls
sought
to
become
an
rso
at
hastings.
cls
accepts
as
members
only
students
who
share
the
society’s
religious
beliefs
and
views
about
sexual
conduct.
because
cls
does
not
welcome
all-comers,
hastings
refused
to
grant
it,
rso
status
but
allowed
the
society
to
engage
in
expressive
activities
on
campus
using
cls’s
own
resources.
cls
filed
suit
contending
that
the
first
amendment
required
hastings
to
accept
the
society
as
an
rso.
the
district
court
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
granted
summary
judgment
to
hastings.
we
affirm
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
relying
on
the
party’s
stipulation
of
the
undisputed
facts
we
hold
that
hastings
all-comers
policy
does
not
unconstitutionally
inhibit
cls’s
freedom
of
speech
or
expression.
cls
asked
us
not
to
focus
on
hastings’s
all-comers
policy
but
on
the
school's
written
nondiscrimination
policy.
we
decline
to
do
so,
cls
stipulated
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
hastings
embracive
all-comers
policy
governs
rso’s
because
cls
is
bound
by
that
stipulation
we
consider
only
whether
the
all-comers
policy
complies
with
the
constitution.
this
court's
decisions
regarding
limited
public-forums
provides
the
framework
for
our
analysis.
a
state
creates
such
a
forum
when
it
confines
use
of
its
resources
to
certain
groups.
state
regulation
of
speech
in
a
limited
public
forum
must
meet
two
conditions;
it
must
be
both
reasonable
in
light
of
the
forum’s
purposes
and
viewpoint
neutral.
hastings’s
all-comers
policy
we
are
satisfied
meets
these
criteria.
first,
the
policy
ensures
that
the
educational
and
social
opportunities
afforded
by
rsos
are
accessible
to
all
students.
rsos
as
i
just
noted,
are
eligible
for
financial
assistance
drawn
from
mandatory
student
activity
fees.
the
policy
ensures
that
no
hastings
student
is
forced
to
fund
a
group
that
would
reject
her
as
a
member.
second,
the
policy
enables
hastings
to
police
compliance
with
the
written
terms
of
its
nondiscrimination
policy,
without
inquiring
into
an
rso’s
motivation
for
membership
decisions.
third,
the
policy
to
the
extent
that
it
brings
together
individuals
with
diverse
beliefs,
encourages
tolerance,
cooperation
and
learning
amongst
students.
fourth,
the
policy
incorporates
and
advances
the
state-law
antidiscrimination
prescriptions.
hastings’s
policy
is
all
the
more
creditworthy
given
the
alternative
channels
open
to
cls
communication
with
students.
hastings
offered
cls
access
to
school
facilities
to
conduct
meetings
and
to
advertise
its
events.
cls,
in
fact
hosted
a
variety
of
activities
the
year
after
hastings
denied
it
recognition.
attendants
at
cls
events
that
year
far
from
dwindling
notably
increased.
as
to
viewpoint
neutrality,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
more
viewpoint
neutral
policy
than
one
requiring
all
student
groups
to
accept
all-comers.
cls
ultimately
contends
that
the
all-comers
policy
is
pretextual
and
selectively
applied
but
the
courts
below
did
not
address
cls’s
pretext
claim
and
this
court
is
not
a
proper
place
to
air
the
issue
in
the
first
instance.
on
remand,
the
ninth
circuit
may
take
up
cls’s
pretext
argument,
if
and
to
the
extent
that
the
argument
was
properly
preserved.
finally,
and
of
overarching
importance,
in
mounting
this
lawsuit,
cls
seeks
not
parity
with
other
organizations
but
preferential
exemption
from
hastings’s
all-comers
policy.
the
first
amendment
shields
cls
against
state
prohibition
of
its
expressive
activity,
exclusionary
as
that
activity
may
be
but
cls,
we
hold
enjoys
no
constitutional
right
to
state
support
of
its
selectivity.
justice
stevens
and
kennedy
have
filed
concurring
opinions.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
thomas
join.
