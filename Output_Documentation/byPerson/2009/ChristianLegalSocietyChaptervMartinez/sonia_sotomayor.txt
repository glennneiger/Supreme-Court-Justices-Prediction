so
is
this
an
exception
that
you
want
to
talk
about
as
it
is
applied
to
religious
groups,
or
are
you
suggesting
that
if
a
group
wanted
to
exclude
all
black
people,
all
women,
all
handicapped
persons,
whatever
other
form
of
discrimination
a
group
wants
to
practice,
that
a
school
has
to
accept
that
group
and
recognize
it,
give
it
funds,
and
otherwise
lend
it
space?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
then,
what
is
--
what
is
wrong
with
the
purpose
of
a
school
to
say
we
don't
wish
any
group
that
doesn't
--
that
discriminates?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
this
sounds
like
a
debate
over
whether
the
policy
as
the
school
believes
it
should
be
implemented
is
not
a
good
one.
but
isn't
that
their
choice?
don't
we
give
deference
to
an
educational
institution
in
terms
of
the
choices
it
makes
about
effecting
its
own
--
its
purposes?
and
the
purpose
here
is
we
don't
want
our
students
to
discriminate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
keep
talking
about
being
forced
to
let
people
in.
and
this
is
where
i'm
a
little
bit
confused
by
your
yellow
brief.
the
school
has
taken
the
position
that
any
group
can
apply
to
use
its
facilities;
priority
and
funding,
et
cetera,
will
only
go
to
recognized
student
groups.
but
your
group
is
not
being
excluded
or
ostracized
completely
from
the
school.
presumably,
you
can
meet
in
the
cafeteria.
you
can
meet
in
open
spaces
in
the
school.
you
can
apply
like
everyone
else,
any
other
nonstudent
group,
recognized
student
group.
but
you
have
been
saying
repeatedly
in
your
presentation
that
you're
barred
from
the
campus.
and
so
i'm
a
little
confused
as
to
exactly--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
let's
--
could
we--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--let's
--
let's
assume,
because
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
the
record
is
on
these
issues
--
i'm
somewhat
confused
on
the
factual
assumptions
underlying
this
case.
but
let's
assume
two
things:
one,
that
in
fact
you
have
the
option
of
applying
for
use
of
the
space
and
that,
assuming
there
are
no
conflicts
and
other
things
that
--
that
are
in
the
normal
course
would
preclude
your
use,
that
you
would
be
granted
use.
is
your
argument
different
in
that
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
are
bulletin
boards.
there
are
other
ones.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
disputing
that
this
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--are
you
disputing
this
is
a
limited
forum,
public
forum?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
we
do
with
the
selective
application
argument,
which
is
what
justice
alito
referred
to
and
justice
scalia,
which
is
it
is
troubling
that
some
of
these
bylaws
do
limit
their
groups?
la
raza
limited
it
to
people
of
hispanic
descent,
and
the
lawyers
guild
to
people
who
adopt
its
--
its
beliefs.
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
this
selective
application
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
in
the
case,
isn't
it?
and
if
it
is,
what
does
it
do
to
your
policy?
