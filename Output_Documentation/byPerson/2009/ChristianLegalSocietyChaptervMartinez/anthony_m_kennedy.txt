m.

now,
these
are
fundamental
arguments,
and
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on
factual
matters
because
that's
frustrating
to
both
the
court
and
the
counsel.
but
we
do
have
the
problem
of
the
stipulation.
the
stipulation
makes
it
clear
that
democrats
and
republicans
can
both
get
into
the
other
one's
club.
that's
the
stipulations
17
and
18
at
220
of
the
joint
appendix.
you
want
to
get
away
from
the
stipulation
by
what,
according
to
your
reply
brief,
hastings
said
in
its
answer,
but
the
stipulation
supersedes
the
answer.
so
if
both
counsel
could
just
address
for
a
moment:
what
is
the
case
that
we
have
here?
you
have
different
views
on
what
case
is
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
do
that,
but
you
--
it's
a
much
different
case
if
hastings
treats
the
cls
differently
than
it
treats
the
democratic
and
republican
clubs.
that's
a
much
different
--
frankly,
it's
a
much
easier
case
for
you.
but
it's
--
it's
frustrating
for
us
not
to
know
what
kind
of
case
we
have
in
front
of
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
that
was
not
a
religion
case.
your
argument
at
its
most
fundamental
level
is
that
religious
organizations
are
different
because
religion
is
all
about
belief.
but
at
that
point
don't
we
also
have
a
tradition
of
separation?
that's
the
whole
reason
why
church
and
state
for
many
purposes
are
kept
separate,
so
that
states
are
not
implicated
with
religious
beliefs.
and
it
--
it
--
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
consider
that
when
we
are
considering
your
argument.
now,
you
can
cite
rosenberger,
but
--
but
i
think
this
is
different
from
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
thought
that
an
important
part
of
the
case,
of
your
case,
is
that
belief
is
inherent
to
the
idea
of
religious
expression
and
must
be
protected.
but
if
the
protection
causes
problems
within
the
school
for
other
policies,
then
doesn't
the
separation
policy
come
into
play?
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
different
from
cantwell.
cantwell
is
where
the
jehovah's
witness
plays
the
record
on
the
--
on
the
street.
and
--
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no.
no.
and
cantwell
said
that
belief
is
central
to
--
to
religions
and
that
people
would
disagree.
but
that's
precisely
why
hastings
might
argue
to
us
that
--
that
this
is
inconsistent
with
their
idea
of
what
this
forum
is.
and
if
--
will
you
just
address
that,
please?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
are
very
few
universities.
but
why
doesn't
this
just
all
work
out?
if
the
christian
legal
society
has
these
beliefs,
i
am
not
so
sure
why
people
that
don't
agree
with
them
want
to
belong
to
them.
what
--
doesn't
this
all
just
work
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
doesn't
it
work
out
that
the
democrats
--
they
don't
want
to
go
in
the
republican
club
and
run
for
officership
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
why
--
what's
--
what
interest
does
this
--
does
the
school
have
in
this
policing
mechanism
that
it's
imposing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
also
never
happened
from,
what
i
can
tell,
that
someone
who
disagrees
with
this
group
has
applied
for
membership.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
what
so
puzzling
about
the
--
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
predecessor
group--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
obviously
uncomfortable
with
their
position,
so
he
or
she
left.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
way
it
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
if
we
think
that
the
policy
has
not
been
evenhandedly
applied?
can't
we
decide
the
case
on
that
basis,
and
then
we
could
just
assume
arguendo
justice
--
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
just
say,
suppose
it
were
shown
that
it
were
not
applied
evenhandedly,
you'd
have
no
problem
with
our
saying
that
it's
then
unconstitutional.
