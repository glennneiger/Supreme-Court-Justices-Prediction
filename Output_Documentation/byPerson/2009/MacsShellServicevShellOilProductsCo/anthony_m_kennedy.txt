is
--
is
leaving
the
premises
the
sine
quo
non
of
a
termination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
aren't
there
--
aren't
there
some
operators
that
own
their
own
premises?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
only
one
of
the
three
would
suffice
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
testing
your
view,
suppose
there
are
two
franchisees,
and
in
each
case
the
oil
company
reduces
the
amount
they're
paying
for
the
gas.
one
franchisee
can't
afford
it,
leaves,
quits
--
termination.
the
other
franchisee
has
a
considerable
amount
of
savings,
and
he
protests,
but
he
stays
in
business.
different
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
in
my
first,
he
ceases
to
operate
and
he
moves
out
of
the
premises.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
government
comes
up
here,
as
i
think
they
will
in
a
few
minutes,
and
tells
us
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
constructive
termination,
do
you
know
what
hypothetical
they
give
us
to
illustrate
how
that
would
work?
i
mean,
it's
their
argument,
but
i'm
curious.
i
will
be
curious
to
know
how
you
would
respond
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
there
is
a
small
universe
of
cases
in
which
there
is
a
constructive
termination
without
leaving
the
premises,
without
severing
the
fuel,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
--
how
you
would
respond
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you'd
just
have
a
magic
words
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
breyer
asked
you
for
a
test.
maybe
this
would
help
you.
if
you
are
the
trial
judge,
how
do
you
instruct
the
jury
to
determine
when
there
has
been
a
constructive
termination?
you
have
to
have
an
instruction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
quite
frankly
amazed
that
you
say
you
don't
have
a
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
coming
up
here
and
telling
us
that
there's
such
a
thing
as
a
constructive
termination,
i
mean
--
but
then
you
don't
have
a
test
for
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
may
be
incorrect.
i
--
i
thought
your
friends
for
the
petitioners
said
there
is
no
case
in
which
there's
a
constructive
eviction
but
where
the
lessee
remains
on
the
premises.
maybe
i
misheard.
what
is
--
what
is
your
principal
case
where
the
lessee
remains
on
the
premises,
but
there
is
a
constructive
eviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
getting
back
to
the
constructive
eviction,
i
took
a
quick
look
at
the
marini
and
ireland
case
that
you
cite,
and
i
think
the
--
the
petitioner
is
correct.
there,
the
tenant
left
part
of
the
premises,
and
it
was
a
constructive
eviction
as
to
that
part.
and
it's
a
1970
case.
i
just
don't
think
you
have
many
cases
to
help
you
in
the
constructive
eviction
area.
it's
kind
of
like
the
holmes
--
sherlock,
not
oliver
wendell--
[laughter]
--that
says
the
dog
doesn't
bark.
i
mean,
there
is
this
huge
body
of
landlord/tenant
law,
and
you
have
just
a
few
cases,
and
one
of
them,
at
least,
doesn't
appear
to
support
you.
