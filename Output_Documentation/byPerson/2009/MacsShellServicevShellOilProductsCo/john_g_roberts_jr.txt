chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-240,
mac's
shell
service
v.
shell
oil
products,
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
lamken.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
all
--
under
one
view,
all
the
dealer
is
doing
is
mitigating
damages.
in
other
words,
the
deal
is
off.
he's
in
effect
been
terminated.
you're
saying,
well
then,
he
has
to
pack
up
and
leave.
he
can
stay
and
still
reduce
the
damages
you
are
going
to
have
to
pay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
you've
lost
the
rights
to
operate
at
a
particular
level.
in
other
words,
if
they
say
--
i
don't
know
how
the
deal
works,
but,
you
know,
you've
got
to
charge
$10
a
gallon
or,
you
know,
you've
got
to
close
the
convenient
mart
or
whatever,
you
have
lost
the
right
to
operate
at
that.
the
terms
of
the
lease
under
which
you
were
operating
have
been
effectively
terminated.
that
doesn't
mean
you
can't
still
make
money,
and
it
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
give
that
up,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the
deal
has
been
terminated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
did
williston
say
about
it?
contract--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
does
williston
say
about
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
--
you
put
forth
this
dichotomy
between
breach
of
contract
and
constructive
termination.
i
don't
know
why
something
can't
be
both.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
o'neil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
farraher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
million
dollars,
right?
that's
the
difference.
you
get
attorneys'
fees
and
expert
fees
in
the
federal
action,
and
presumably
you
don't
in
the
state
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
have
the
option,
right?
if
you
accept
the
idea
that
there's
a
constructive
termination
under
your
view,
even
if
you
don't
leave,
i
guess
you
have
the
option
to
stay
in
business
or
to
leave
at
any
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lamken,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
so
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-240,
mac's
shell
service
versus
shell
oil
products
and
the
consolidated
case.
