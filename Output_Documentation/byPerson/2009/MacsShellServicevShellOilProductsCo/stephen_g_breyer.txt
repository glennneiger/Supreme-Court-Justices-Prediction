justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
happens
--
in
other
words,
suppose
the
landlord
here
really
wants
the
guy
to
clear
out,
so
he
puts
thumbtacks
on
the
ground
and
horrible-smelling
things
all
over.
and
then
the
franchisee
leaves,
but
the
franchisor
says:
hey,
i
didn't
want
you
to
leave;
that's
your
problem.
i
mean,
that's
constructive
eviction
or
constructive
termination?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
suppose
it's
the
same
situation,
but
this
person,
the
franchisee,
being
quite
indefatigable
and
daring,
finds
a
way
of
sneaking
through
the
barbed
wire
that
has
been
put
up.
and
there's
one
pump
they
forgot,
and
there's
a
car
that
comes
up,
and
he
serves
that
person.
now
is
it
constructive
eviction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
objective?
you'd
say
any
sensible
person
would
clear
out
immediately.
there
are
lions
and
tigers
roaming
the
gas
station.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
suppose
he
doesn't,
though,
that
he
doesn't
clear
out
because
he's
not
sensible,
and
he
just
desperately
needs
the
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
they
do
something
reasonably
designed
--
a
reasonable
person
would
clear
out,
then
why
not
clear
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
the
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
test?
because
if
you
say
we
are
going
to
give
an
action
to
a
person
who
didn't
clear
out,
although
the
franchisor
was
trying
to
get
him
to
clear
out,
you
are
then
going
to
convert
into
a
federal
action
every
single
breach
of
contract
or
serious
breach
of
contract
that
there
is,
which
is
the
precise
opposite
of
what
congress
wanted
when
it
passed
this
statute.
so,
what
is
your
test
as
to
we
know
that
your
case
is
the
lions
and
tigers
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
i'd
say
constructive
termination
means
you
didn't
terminate.
okay?
that's
what
"constructive"
means.
it
means
you
didn't
do
it.
but
sometimes
a
franchisor
could
act
in
such
a
way
that
the
law
should
treat
it
as
if
he
really
did.
all
right?
i
can
imagine
a
test
for
that.
but
we
have
the
second
problem
here,
is
that
even
if
the
conduct
was
designed
--
it's
equal
to
terminating
it
--
this
individual
didn't
leave.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
was
still
there
running
the
business.
that's
the
part
i
would
like
to
test
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
want
to
know
your
test
for
deciding
--
even
though
the
first
part
is
met,
how
you
apply
it
when
the
person
didn't
leave?
i
understand
a
person
who
left.
he
left.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
franchisor
says:
i
didn't
tell
him
to
leave.
and
then
you
go
look
to
see
if
the
franchisor's
conduct
was
so
bad,
it
was
the
same
as
if
you
told
him
to
leave.
i've
got
that
part.
the
part
i
don't
have
is
what
happens
if
he
doesn't
leave?
because
one
thing
we
know,
the
conduct
wasn't
so
bad
that
this
person
left,
because
he
didn't
leave.
that's
that
second
part
that's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
need
--
the
injunctive
remedies
in
the
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
but
the
reason
i
need
a
test
is
because
the
other
side
is
saying:
i
know
what
the
test
is;
the
test
is
he
has
to
leave.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you
--
if
you
can
show
me
some
cases
or
a
test
or
something
where
he
didn't
have
to
leave,
even
though
the
franchisor's
conduct
was
so
bad
that
a
reasonable
person
would
have
left,
then
i'm
on
to
something
and
i
know
where
to
go.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
that
--
that
i
see
here
is
that
if
in
fact
you
are
right,
that
the
--
the
franchisor
--
he
breached
the
contract
in
your
view.
did
that
breach
rise
to
a
termination?
did
it
rise
to
that
level?
now,
it's
simply
a
question,
since
he
breached
the
contract,
of
what
court
you
are
going
to
sue
in,
in
your
view.
if
this
isn't
a
termination,
you
sue
in
state
court;
if
it
is
a
termination,
you
sue
in
federal
court.
so,
why
--
why
wouldn't
we
say,
well,
let
him
sue
in
state
court,
because
if
the
person
stays
on
the
premises,
everything
becomes
blurred.
if
you
require
him
to
leave
the
premises,
then
it's
clear.
if
you
were
to
let
him
stay
on
the
premises
and
also
argue
it's
a
termination,
we
are
going
to
have
people
coming
into
federal
court
because
they
think
there
are
more
damages
or
something,
i
guess,
or
whatever
reason.
there
will
be
a
whole
lot
of
unclear
cases.
so
it's
better
to
have
a
clear
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
going
to
say
they
have
a
right
to,
but
the
other
side
thinks
they
don't.
so
it
doesn't
answer
my
question
to
just
refer
to
the
fact
that
you
have
a
right
to.
my
question
is
a
practical
question:
what's
the
harm
of
sticking
to
the
clear
line
that
is
normally
there
in
other
cases,
in
this
case
not
depriving
your
client
of
a
remedy
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
saying
he
goes
to
state
court
to
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
have
a
choice,
you
know.
so,
here's
your
choice,
dealer:
stay
there
and
sue
in
state
court,
and
by
the
way,
if
they
are
charging
you
too
much
money
under
the
contract
and
you
are
really
hurting
doing
--
putting
lions
and
tigers,
whatever
they
are
doing,
go
get
an
injunction
in
state
court.
see?
they
have
injunctions
in
state
courts.
that
exists.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or,
you
have
the
other
choice.
move
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
if
you
move
out,
you
can
sue
under
federal
law,
and
you
will
get
all
these
other
things
like
the
extra
million
dollars
or
something.
so,
move
out
and
get
the
extra
money,
or
stay
there
and
sue
under
state
court.
why
is
that
a
bad
choice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
theory
of
it
is
to
protect
the
dealer,
and
the
dealer
here
is
faced
with
a
company
that
says,
we
are
not
going
to
renew
your
lease.
and
they
are
unreasonable,
and
the
dealers
think.
the
statute
says:
fine,
don't
renew
it,
okay?
and,
here,
we'll
give
you
a
really
good
deal,
so
you
won't
be
hurt.
if
you
really
think
he's
wrong,
go
sue
for
an
injunction.
and,
second,
we
are
going
to
give
you
extra
bonus
damages
and
attorneys'
fees
and
all
that
stuff.
so
we
protected
you
a
lot.
now,
why
should
there
be
a
third
thing
that
the
statute
says
nothing
about,
which
nobody's
ever
heard
of?
you
just
stay
there,
and
you
say:
i'm
going
to
just
do
business
every
day,
just
like
nothing
happened,
and
i
write
the
words
under
protest.
i
mean,
why
would
congress
have
gone
to
all
that
trouble
if
that's
all
you
have
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
there
is
a
purpose,
and
the
purpose
is
that
this
system
at
least
brings
a
judge
in
to
see
if
that
dealer
really
does
have
enough
of
a
claim
to
get
this
relaxed
injunction.
but
your
system
leaves
it
100
percent
up
to
that
dealer.
it
could
be
heard
of
that
dealer
really
doesn't
have
a
good
claim,
and
all
he
does
is
write
the
words
"under
protest".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
don't
have
a
judge
in
it,
at
that
stage,
under
your
interpretation.
