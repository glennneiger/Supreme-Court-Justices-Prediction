may
i
ask
you
--
we
often
talk
about
price
adjustments
as
causing
the
disputes
between
the
franchisee
and
the
franchisor.
to
what
extent
in
these
sets
of
contracts
is
the
right
of
the
franchisor
to
adjust
the
price
controlled
by
terms
of
the
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
the
formula
required
by
the
contract,
or
it's
just
its
own
discretion
to
use
the
formula?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
lamken,
isn't
it
true
that
the
statute,
as
a
whole,
expressed
congress's
feeling
that
the
common
law
rules
were
really
not
sufficient
because,
under
the
common
law,
of
course,
they
could
just
non-renew
because
they
wanted
to
take
over
the
franchise
themselves.
and
under
the
statute,
that
is
not
permissible.
so
there's
a
major
change
that's
created
by
the
statute,
which
suggests,
to
me,
that
maybe
they
didn't
want
to
adopt
all
the
preexisting
common
law.
