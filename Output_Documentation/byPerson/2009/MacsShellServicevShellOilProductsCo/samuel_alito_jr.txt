well,
what
is
the
government's--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
what
is
--
what
is
the
difference
between
your
understanding
of
an
implicit
termination,
which
is
what
i
take
it
you
have
just
been
describing,
and
a
constructive
termination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
the
franchisor
completely
refuses
to
supply
gas,
that's
an
implicit
termination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
he
charges
$1,000
a
gallon,
that's
not
a
termination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
franchisor
is
raising
the
price
of
gas,
how
does
the
factfinder
determine
whether
it's
sufficient
to
justify
a
constructive
termination?
and
assume
that
the
franchisee
leaves
--
the
price
of
gas
is
raised,
and
this
particular
franchisee
says:
i
can't
operate
if
gas
is
sold
to
me
at
that
price.
what's
the
standard
for
determining
whether
there
was
a
constructive
termination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what's
a
reasonable
franchisee
in
that
situation?
presumably
some
have
a
small
profit
margin;
some
have
a
bigger
profit
margin.
some
could
operate
if
the
price
of
gas
is
raised;
some
could
not.
how
is
that
to
be
determined?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
are
putting
a
jury
in
sort
of
the
situation
of
a
--
of
a
rate
regulator,
aren't
you,
if
you
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
it
a
reasonable
rate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
are
these--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
these
petitioners
remained
in
--
in
business,
is
--
that's
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
they
make
money
during
this
period?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
but
one
remained
in
business,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
does
that
mean,
"effectively
eliminated"?
the
--
the
first
circuit
said,
if
"the
breach
of
the
lease
was
such
a
material
change
that
it
effectively
ended
the
lease,
even
though
the
plaintiffs
continued
to
operate
the
business.
"
--i
have
no
idea
what
that
means.
what
does
it
mean
to
effectively
end
the
lease
even
though
the
lease
continues?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
know,
but
could
you
put
that
in
somewhat
more
concrete
terms,
or
can
you
not
get
any
more
specific
than
to
say
the
lease
is
effectively
ended?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now
these
consolidated
cases
come
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
petroleum
marketing
practices
act
limits
the
circumstances
in
which
petroleum
franchisors
can
terminate
a
franchise
or
fail
to
renew
a
franchise
relationship.
in
this
action
service
station
franchisees
brought
suit,
alleging
that
a
petroleum
franchisor
had
violated
the
act
by
constructively
terminating
their
franchises
and
by
constructingly
failing
to
renew
their
franchise
relationships.
significantly,
the
franchisees
asserted
these
claims,
even
though
the
conduct
of
which
they
complained
had
not
compelled
any
of
them
to
abandon
their
franchise
operations,
and
even
though
they
had
been
offered
and
had
accepted
renewal
agreements.
for
reasons
set
out
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
a
franchisee
cannot
maintain
a
claim
for
constructive
termination
under
the
petroleum
marketing
practices
act
when
the
franchisor's
allegedly
wrongful
conduct
did
not
compel
the
franchisee
to
abandon
one
or
more
of
the
statutory
elements
of
its
franchise.
in
addition,
we
conclude
that
a
franchisee
who
signs
and
operates
under
a
renewal
agreement
with
a
franchisor
cannot
thereafter
recover
for
unlawful
non-renewal.
we,
therefore,
reverse
in
part,
affirm
in
part
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
