mr.
david
o'neil
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
agrees
with
shell
that,
because
there
was
no
termination
or
non-renewal
in
any
meaningful
sense
of
the
word,
the
dealers
failed
to
state
a
claim
under
the
pmpa.
but,
justice
ginsburg,
you
are
correct:
the
government
parts
company
with
shell
about
what
the
term
--
word
"termination",
does
cover.
shell
would
limit
the--
mr.
david
o'neil
--when
the
franchisee
is
actually
forced
to
end
one
of
the
statutory
elements
of
the
franchise
in
response
to
the
franchisor's
conduct.
and
that's
the
same
test
that
would
be
applied
in
the
constructive
discharge
or
constructive
eviction
context.
mr.
david
o'neil
that's
correct.
mr.
david
o'neil
that's
correct.
and
that
is
the
same
rule
that
--
that
would
apply
to
any
other--
mr.
david
o'neil
--it--
mr.
david
o'neil
--if
a
franchisee
is
faced
with
franchisor
conduct
that
will
leave
the
franchisee
with
no
alternative
but
to
abandon
a
statutory
element,
then
the
franchisee
in
that
situation
can
go
in
and
say
that
he
is
in
the
equivalent
position
to
someone
who
has
received
a
piece
of
paper
saying:
you
are
hereby
terminated.
and
we
would
say
that
for
purposes
of
seeking
preliminary
injunctive
relief,
that
the
franchisee
can
claim
that
he
has
been
terminated
for
those
purposes.
mr.
david
o'neil
well,
a
judge
would
only
deny
a
preliminary
injunction
if
either
there
were
no
serious
question
going
to
the
merits
on
the
termination
question
or
if
the
balance
of
hardships
did
not
tip
in
the
franchisee's
favor.
and
then
the
franchisee
would
be
in
a
very
difficult
position
to
claim
that
it
was
in
some
kind
of
catch-22,
because
by
definition
the
judge
would
have
found
that
the
franchisor
is
in
a
worse
condition
by
having
to
continue
the
relationship.
mr.
david
o'neil
justice
scalia,
we
--
we
agree
with
shell
on
this.
the
statute
defines
"franchise"
by
three
elements:
the
supply
of
fuel,
the
use
of
the
leased
premises,
and
the
use
of
the
trademark.
so
someone
who
is
still
on
a
gas
station
premises
that
had
the
shell
sign
above
them
but
that
had
no
fuel
would
not
be
operating
a
gas
station
franchise,
and
that
would
be
a
termination
even
if
the
franchisee
did
not
actually
pick
up
and
leave
the
premises.
so
we
would
call
that
a
termination.
mr.
david
o'neil
the
test
is,
first
of
all,
whether
the
franchisor's
conduct
was
wrongful
--
in
other
words,
in
violation
of
the
agreement
between
the
parties;
and
whether
a
reasonable
franchisee
in
those
circumstances
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
do
what
that
franchisee
did
and
to
abandon
the
premises.
mr.
david
o'neil
well,
it's
the
same
kind
of
question
that
juries
ask
all
the
time
--
juries
answer
all
the
time
in
constructive
discharge
and
constructive
eviction
cases.
indeed,
we
think
it
may
be
easier
to
answer
that
question
in
this
context,
because
constructive
discharge
and
constructive
eviction
will
often
turn
on
intangible
psychological
factors
like
the
level
of
indignity
that
an
employee
would
suffer
before
leaving
his
job.
gas
station
franchises
are
operated
for
--
to
make
money,
and
if
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
franchisee
to
do
that,
then
a
reasonable
franchisee
in
those
circumstances
would
have
no
choice
but
to--
mr.
david
o'neil
--no.
mr.
david
o'neil
no.
the
question
is
whether
it
would
be
so
intolerable
--
not
whether
the
rate
is
fair,
but
whether
it
would
be
so
intolerable
that
a
reasonable
franchisee,
a
rational
franchisee
who
is
economically
motivated,
would
have
any
alternative
but
to
abandon
it.
and
if
the
franchisee
could
continue
in
business,
then
it
is
not
a
constructive
termination.
the
franchisee
might
have
a
claim
for
breach
of
contract,
but
as
long
as
--
as
long
as
it
would
not
be
a
fitting
response
to
actually
abandon
the
premises,
then
that
is
not
a
constructive
termination.
mr.
david
o'neil
when--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
justice
scalia,
the
whole
point
of
the
pmpa
was
that
state
law
remedies
were
inadequate
in
that
narrow
context
where
the
franchisee's
very
existence
was
threatened.
mr.
david
o'neil
yes,
and
under
well-established
background
principles
of
the
law
that
congress
was
drawing
on
when
it
enacted
the
pmpa,
termination
was
not
limited
solely
to
explicit
termination.
mr.
david
o'neil
the
relationship
here
is
in
essence
one
of
landlord
and
tenant.
and
so
it
was
natural
for
congress
to
draw
on
that
body
of
law,
as
well
as
the
body
of
law
governing
the
termination
of
other
kinds
of
relationships
like
employment,
for
the
meaning
of
the
--
of
pmpa.
mr.
david
o'neil
justice
ginsburg,
i
am
not
aware
of
those
cases,
and
i
think
the
general
rule
is
the
one
that
--
that
is
--
is
broadly
stated
in
the
cases,
which
is
that
if
the
franchisee
--
excuse
me,
if
the
tenant
wants
to
claim
constructive
eviction,
they
need
to
leave
the
premises.
that
is
a
bedrock
principle
of
the
law,
that
in
order
to
claim
constructive
eviction,
you
actually
have
to
leave.
mr.
david
o'neil
that's
exactly
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
o'neil
no,
and
that's
where--
mr.
david
o'neil
--that's
where
an
objective
standard
is
important,
because
we
don't
look
to
the
particularly
clever--
mr.
david
o'neil
--that's
exactly
right,
and
that's
why--
mr.
david
o'neil
--if
the
franchisee
does
not
leave,
then
he
does
not
state
a
claim
for
constructive
termination.
and
that
is
how
the
law
operates
in
every
other
area
in
which
this
doctrine
applies.
so
if
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
claims
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
or
gender,
she
cannot
stay
in
her
job
and
at
the
same
time
claim
that
she
was
fired.
i
mean
that's--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
as
i
said--
mr.
david
o'neil
--as
i
said,
if
one
of
the
three
elements
of
the
--
of
the
statutory
franchise
has
been
terminated,
then
that
is
a
termination
under
the
act.
and
that's
how
the
act
defines
franchise.
it
defines
it
by
all
three
elements
of
the
franchise,
and
so
if
one
of
them
is
terminated,
that
is
a
termination.
mr.
david
o'neil
in
general,
these
are
open
--
open-term
price
contracts,
so
that
in
these
--
in
these
leases,
for
example,
shell
had
the
right
to
set
the
price
of
fuel
using
a
formula
that
it
formulated
in
its
discretion.
mr.
david
o'neil
it's
just
in
its
discretion
to
use
the
formula.
mr.
david
o'neil
it's
an
open
price
term.
but
u.c.c.
2305
would
imply
in
most
contracts
a
--
a
requirement
that,
where
there
is
an
open
price
term,
there
can't
be
unreasonable
increases
in
the
--
in
the
price.
mr.
david
o'neil
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
