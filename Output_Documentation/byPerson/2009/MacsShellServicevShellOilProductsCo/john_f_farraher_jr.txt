mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
jury
determined
that
shell
and
motiva
engaged
in
conduct
designed
--
prohibited
by
the
pmpa
when
they
raised
rent
to
force
dealers
out
of
business
and
convert
their
stations
to
direct
operations.
nevertheless,
shell
and
motiva
argue
that
conduct
designed
to
force
the
dealers
out
of
business
is
insufficient
to
invoke
statutory
protection
because
the
dealers
were
not
deprived
of
any
of
the
statutory
elements
of
the
franchise,
and
they
remained
in
business
for
some
period
following
the
rental
increase.
if
accepted,
the
practical
effect
of
shell
and
motiva's
position
will
allow
franchisors
to
circumvent
the
pmpa
and
terminate
franchises
at
any
time,
at
any
reason,
by
simply
increasing
the
burden
on
their
operations.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
your
honor--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--your
honor,
some
of
the
petitioners--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--some
of
the
petitioners
remained
in
business,
certainly,
post-elimination
of
the
subsidy.
the
amount
of
time
varied
from
person
to
person.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
well,
your
honor,
we
have
to
take
this
in
context.
this
is
a
--
these
are
small
business
owners
who
have
invested
their
livelihoods
in
operating
these
franchises.
they
are
trying
to
keep
the
business
operational
against
perhaps
all
odds
and
perhaps--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
justice
breyer,
i
believe
that
you
hit
on
two
points:
first
off,
what
is
the
test
sufficient
to
invoke
a
constructive
termination?
and
then,
secondly,
a
point
that
the
panel
has
addressed
is
whether
or
not
abandonment
of
the
franchise
is
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--the
test,
your
honor
--
first
off,
with
respect
to
whether
the
conduct
is
sufficient
to
force
a
termination,
we
believe
the
first
circuit's
standard
of
materiality,
which
is
effective
to
end
one
of
the
components
of
the
statutorily
defined
franchise,
is
sufficient.
with
respect
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
which
is
why
didn't
these
dealers
leave
the
station,
and--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--right.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
and
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
there's
a
test
for
that,
but
certainly
the
statute
doesn't
contemplate
that
the
dealer
would
have
to
leave.
for
example,
the
injunctive
remedy
in
the
statute
would
allow
a
dealer
to
come
in--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--they
are
different,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
but
that--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--your
honor
--
and
the
point
is
that
i
don't
think
the
franchisee
need
necessarily
leave
as
contemplated
by
the
statute.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
and
that--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--well--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--we
do
have
a
test,
your
honor,
and
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
conduct
has
effectively
eliminated
an
essential
component
of
one
of
the
three
elements
of
the
franchise.
in
this
case,
the
first
circuit
used
a
materiality
standard
that
said
that
the
lease
was
effectively
ended.
and
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
the
franchise
as
defined
by
the
three
elements,
what
the
judge
asked
the
jury
to
determine
was,
was
the
agreement
that
shell
entered
into
with
these
franchisees,
with
the
essential
component
being
the
subsidy,
was
that
effectively
eliminated--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--yes,
your
honor,
justice
alito.
the
statute
contemplates
a
distinction
in
the
relationship
between
a
franchise,
which
is
a
set
of
contracts,
and
a
franchise
relationship.
a
franchise
relationship
continues
after
the
expiration
of
the
--
of
the
franchise.
in
this
case
here
what
the
judge
was
charging
the
jury
was
--
what
the
question
was,
was
the
breach
of
the
lease
so
material
that
it
effectively
ended
the
--
the
agreement
that
shell
had
entered
into
with
its
dealers,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
there
was
some
relationship
that
continued
with
the
parties
afterwards?
in
other
words--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--we
--
we
think
that
that
certainly
was
a
sufficient
standard.
the
circuit
courts
that
have
decided
the
issue
have
arguably
employed
a
lower
standard.
they
have
talked
about
a
breach
of
one
of
the
franchise
agreements
being
sufficient.
but
certainly
we
believe
the
first
circuit
set
an
appropriate
standard
here
with
the
materiality
being--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--your
honor,
certainly
in
our
--
in
our
briefs
we
have
referred
to
cases
where
constructive
evictions
in
some
settings
will
allow
a
tenant
to
stay
in
a
premises.
certainly,
the
--
the
majority
of
the
cases
decided
in
the
discharge
context
or
an
eviction
setting
do
require
what
you
have
suggested,
which
is
an
end
in
that
the
person
leaves
their
employment
or
leaves
their--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--justice
kennedy,
on
page
38
of
the
main
brief
in
the
footnote,
we've
cited
two
cases
in
new
jersey
that
allow
for
that
proposition.
certainly,
conceding
that
the
majority
of
the
courts
have
held
that
an
--
the
tenant
leaving
the
premise
in
a
constructive
eviction
setting
is
a
necessary
prerequisite
to
the
claim.
but
we
also
recognize
that--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--your
honor,
i
would
--
i
would
concede
that
in
all
likelihood,
a
franchisor
would
take
some
affirmative
conduct,
whether
that
be
through
a
notice
of
termination
or
other
step.
but,
yes,
that
would
happen.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
well--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
respectfully
disagree.
and
i
think
the
government
and
shell
would
both
concede
that
written
notification,
although
required
by
the
statute,
is
not
necessarily
always
going
to
be
given.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
that
--
that
may
be
true,
your
honor.
but
in
this
case
here
what
shell's
position
is
that
they
can
--
they
can
--
and
--
and
put
such
intolerable
conduct
at
issue,
for
example,
raising
the
rent
by
several
hundred
percent,
and
that
doesn't
constitute
a
termination
in
any
respect,
even
if
--
even
if
the
dealer
were
to
leave.
they
argue
that
they
must
affirmatively
withhold
one
of
the
statutory
elements
of
the
franchise
from
the
dealer.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
again
--
again
the
statute
doesn't
contemplate
--
and
--
and
we
have
to,
again,
go
back
to
the
statute
to
recognize
what
the
word
"termination"
means
in
the
context
of
the
petroleum
marketing
practices
act.
certainly,
shell
envisions
that
it
means
that
there
must
be
an
end
to
the
relationship.
the
solicitor
would
concede,
i
believe,
that
the
dealer
could
remain
on
the
premises
if
there
was
such
sufficient
conduct
to
force
them
out
of
business
that
a
reasonable
person
would
think
they
have
no
ability
to
continue
in
business.
but
then
the
solicitor
imposes
a
condition
that
that
franchisee
must
seek
an
injunction
in
order
to
have
a
claim
under
the
act.
our
position
is
that
the
injunction
is
a
form
of
a
relief
to
protect
the
franchisee,
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
but
the
existence
of
a
claim
under
the
statute
does
not
depend
upon
whether
or
not
the
franchisee
seeks
the
injunction.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
your
honor,
this
--
this
case
has
had
a
--
a
long
history
to
it.
the
case
was
initially
filed
as
in
the
matter
of
tsanikilides
in
the
u.s.
district
court
and
assigned
to
judge
zobel.
our
prior
counsel
did
seek
an
injunction.
it's
not
clear
on
the
record
why
that
injunction
was
withdrawn
at
the
time
that
the
tsanikilides
case
was
dismissed.
but
then
when
the
marcoux
or
the
mac's
shell
case
was
re-filed,
it's
correct
that
the
dealers
did
not
initially
move
for
injunctive
relief.
and
i
think
there
were
two
reasons
for
that.
number
one,
it
was
always
contemplated
with
judge
zobel
that
this
matter
would
proceed
on
an
expedited
basis,
that
discovery
would
lead
to
trial
within
a
very
short
period
of
time.
and,
number
two,
even
though
there
is
a
relaxed
standard
for
injunctive
relief,
it
was
not
clear
that
the
dealers
would
be
able
to
sufficiently
meet
their
burden
of
proof
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
an
injunction
should
be
issued.
again,
we
are
dealing
here
in
a
practical
effect
of
asking
an
oil
company
on
a
national
basis
to
be
enjoined
from
implementing
this
change
in
rent
that
they
had
brought
about.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
the
damages
awarded
were
precisely
the
same,
and
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that,
in
fact,
there
would
be
no
double
recovery
for
the
--
for
the
dealers
here,
that
they
would
only
recover
once.
the
breach
of
contract
was
pled
as
an
alternative
theory.
and
the
difference
being
that
under
the
pmpa
the
dealers
were
also
awarded
their
attorneys'
fees
and
expert
witness
fees
as
well,
which
was
a
--
a
number
north
of
a
million
dollars.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
well,
your
honor,
again,
the
--
the
reason
that
the
dealers
are
coming
to
federal
court
is
because
congress
enacted
a
statute
to
protect
them--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--i
disagree
with
the
court
that
the
client
is
not
being
deprived
of
a
remedy.
the
remedy
available
in
the
statute
in
one
part
is
injunctive
relief.
and
while
the
dealers
did
not
avail
themselves
of
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
lesser
standard
and
the
lack
of
a
need
to
show
irreparable
harm
protects
the
franchisee
under
a
federal
cause
of
action
as
distinguished
from
a
contractual-based
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
we
--
we
--
we
do
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
in
a
case
where
a
dealer
comes
to
the
court
for
relief
and
they
have
available
to
them
the
injunctive
remedy,
which
does
not
require
the
irreparable
harm
component
be
demonstrated,
it
keeps
the
dealer
in
business.
certainly
congress
intended
to
protect
franchisees.
they
intended
for
competition
in
the
marketplace
to
continue.
and--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--they
certainly
do,
your
honor.
and
--
and
what
happened
here,
obviously,
is
that
the
oil
company
imposed
such
onerous
conditions
that
they
expected
dealers
would
leave.
and,
in
fact,
in
massachusetts
within
the
time
period
of
the
elimination
--
the
formation
of
motiva,
within
a
5-year
period
thereafter,
the
numbers
dropped
almost
by
50
percent.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
they
certainly
do.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
your
honor--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--it's
--
it's
a
bad
choice,
your
honor,
because
it
puts
the
dealer
in
a
position
of
having
to
determine
whether
they
should
abandon
their
lives'
works
in
order
to
benefit
from
a
--
from
a
federal
cause
of
action.
it's
a
bad
idea
because
in
the
oil
company's
view,
we
don't
get
to
make
that
choice,
even
despite
their
bad
conduct
unless
they
affirmatively
stop
providing
us
with
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
statutory
elements
of
the
franchise.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
--
with
--
again,
with
the
injunctive
relief
available,
a
court
could
in
the
initial
stages
without
the
aid
of
discovery
determine
whether
--
what
the
parties'
obligations
are
during
the
course
of
the
litigation.
here
the
dealers
continued
to
pay
the
exorbitant
rents
that
were
being
charged.
so
i
would
argue
that
the
oil
company
was
at
no
point
in
time
harmed
by
virtue
of
the
claim
and
then
the
proceedings
that
ensued.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
would
not
have
happened
during
the
pendency
of
the
litigation.
so,
again,
to
the
extent
that
the
--
an
injunction
had
been
sought,
it
would
have
helped
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
and
in
this
case,
again,
here,
the
oil
company
was
not
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
harmed
by
the
dealers'
pursuit
of
their
claim
because
they
continued
to
pay
their
rent,
for
those
that
remained
in
business,
and
those
that
went
out
of
business
obviously
stopped.
your
honors,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
other
claim,
which
is
also
present
in
this
case
here,
the
claim
of
the
non-renewal,
both
the
government
and
shell
have
suggested
that
the
statute
imposes
some
sort
of
a
mandatory
mechanism
requiring
the
franchisor
to
give
notice
and
then
the
dealer
seeking
an
injunction
within
90
days
in
order
--
in
connection
with
the
non-renewal
claim.
i
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
we
need
to
start
with
the
proposition
of
what
the
jury
found
here,
and
the
jury
found
that,
in
this
case,
the
oil
company
added
new
terms
to
the
lease
specifically
for
the
purposes
of
converting
the
franchise-operated
stations
to
direct
operations.
they
wanted
the
dealers
out
of
business,
and
they
wanted
to
take
over
operations
of
their
stations.
had
the
oil
company
issued
a
notice
of
non-renewal
when
the
parties
didn't
reach
agreement
on
the
terms
of
the
agreement
and
this
case
had
proceeded
to
a
trial,
there
is
no
question,
but
that
the
result
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
as
the
result
is
here.
so
the
question
we
are
facing
is
whether
or
not
this
mechanism
that
they
have
advanced
as
being
the
--
the
only
way,
the
exclusive
remedy
to
proceed
is,
in
fact,
such,
and
we
would
argue
that,
in
fact,
it
is
not.
both
the
government
and
the
solicitor
have
conceded
already
that,
while
the
statute
requires
notice
in
the
normal
course,
that,
certainly,
notice
can
be
side-stepped,
and
that
conduct
can
give
rise
to
notice.
the
next
question
then
would
be
whether
or
not
the
dealer
must
seek
injunctive
relief
as
a
prerequisite
to
maintaining
a
claim,
and
we
argue
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
suggesting
that
the
injunction
is
mandatory.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
well,
certainly,
your
honor,
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
while
the
--
while
congress
provides
for
injunctive
relief,
which
would
be
applicable
equally
to
non-renewal
claims
as
it
would
to
termination
claims,
and
while
the
statute
speaks
to
notice,
again,
applicable
to
both,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
statutory
language
that
says
this
is
a
mandatory
exhaustion
of
remedies.
you
must
seek
an
injunction--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--we
think
that
our
case,
certainly,
is
distinguishable
from
the
other
two
circuits
that
have
addressed
the
issue.
in
our
case,
our
dealers
filed
a
lawsuit
before
they
were
presented
with
the
leases
for
signature.
they
told
the
oil
company
that
they
were
signing
under
protest,
with
a
reservation
of
all
their
rights.
it
was
the
oil
company
that
presented
the
leases
to
them
on
a
take-it-or-leave-it
basis.
they
said,
there
will
be
no
negotiation
of
these
terms,
and
you
must
sign,
and
if
you
don't
sign,
we
are
going
to
issue
a
notice
of
non-renewal.
and
then
that
pins
the
continuation
of
the
dealers'
business
on
the
hopes
that,
even
with
a
relaxed
standard,
a
trial
court
is
going
to
issue
an
injunction.
and
i
certainly
don't
think
that
the
statute
or
the
congress
intended
for
the
dealers
to
risk
their
businesses
on
the
likelihood
of
getting
the
injunctive
relief--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
are
you
--
are
you
asking
whether
we
accept
the
proposition
that
the
--
the
waiver
of
rights--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--the
seventh
circuit,
if
i
understand
the
case
correctly,
your
honor,
says
that
there's
no
implied
cause
of
action
under
2805(f)
standing
alone,
that
if
a
franchisor
is
insisting
upon
a
term
that
includes
a
waiver,
as
in
connection
with
non-renewal,
then
the
dersch
decision
in
the
seventh
circuit
would
say
that
that
might
be
actionable
under
2802(b)(3)
because
they
have
introduced
a
term
that
is
not
agreed
upon
and
is
designed
for
the
purposes
of
forcing
the
dealers
out
of
business.
i
don't
know
that
we
have
taken
an
opinion,
whether
or
not
there's
an
independent
or
implied
cause
of
action
standing
alone
under
2805(f).
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
your
honor,
i
appreciate
the
--
the
argument,
and,
certainly,
i
--
i
think
it
is
supportive
of
the
dealers'
claims
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
i
think
it--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--your
honor,
i
can't
answer,
in
hindsight,
why
we
didn't
raise
it
in
the
brief,
but
i
do
hear
the
position
that
you
are
advocating
and
think
it
is
supportive
of
the
--
of
the
dealers'
position
here.
if
there
are
no
additional
questions--
mr.
john
f
farraher
jr
--your
honor,
i
--
i
guess
the
--
the
best
response
i
have
to
that
proposition
is
that
we
are
not
dealing
in
a
traditional
landlord/tenant
context
here.
we
are
dealing
under
a
statutory
scheme
that
congress
enacted
to
protect
franchisees,
and
we
need
to
look
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
as
to
what
termination
means.
i
would
also
say
that,
in
the
landlord/tenant
context,
while
the,
perhaps,
outdated
notion
of
a
constructive
eviction
would
require
the
tenant
to
leave,
cases
seem
to
suggest,
in
a
more
modern
sense,
that
the
relationship
between
the
landlord
and
the
tenant
is
more
of
a
contractual
relationship
in
nature
and,
as
such,
allows
for
the
traditional
remedies
available
under
contract
law,
in
turning
--
including
self-help
and
rescission,
et
cetera.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
