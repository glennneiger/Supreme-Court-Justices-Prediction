justice

when
would
you
--
when
would
you
measure
your
constructive
termination?
at
what
point
would
the
statute
of
limitations
begin
to
run
or
stop
under
your
definition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
--
you
would
say
that
the
franchisee
in
this
situation
would
have
had
to
say:
i
can't
pay
the
increased
amount
of
rent
without
the
subsidy;
i'm
going
to
stop.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
going
to
leave
the
premises.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what
about
the
statutory
right
for
a
preliminary
injunction?
when
would
that
right
kick
in,
in
this
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
the
preliminary
injunction
stops
the
change
of
a
contract
price
--
of
a
contract
term,
obviously,
or
it
continues
it.
so
when
--
at
what
point
would--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
for
--
if
for
whatever
reason
the
judge
says
no
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
that's
the
end
of
it;
the
franchisee
just
has
to
leave
the
premises?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
we
--
can
--
perhaps
to
bring
this
to
more
practical
terms,
you
can
walk
through
with
me.
i'm
going
to
assume
that
if
a
franchisor
changes
a
rent
term
and
the
franchisee
refuses
to
pay,
wouldn't
the
franchisor
at
some
point
give
a
notice
of
termination?
what
franchisor
is
going
to
sit
through
months
and
months
and
years
of
waiting
for
payment
before
kicking
someone
out?
is
it
--
is
that
rationally
going
to
happen
in
any
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
--
or,
so
that
in
almost
all
situations,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
leased
premises,
in
a
breach
of
the
leased
premises,
the
termination
would
be
--
would
have
to
happen.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
do
we
need
to
make
a
constructive
eviction
theory
when,
on
a
practical
basis,
there
always
in
this
situation
has
to
be
a
notice
of
termination,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
premises
part?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know.
but
at
some
point
the
franchisor
is
going
to
have
to
take
over
the
premises,
either
by
trying
to
evict
the
person
or
locking
them
out.
no
--
no
rational
franchisor
is
going
to
raise
rent,
not
have
the
franchisee
pay,
and
fail
to
terminate
the
agreement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
franchisee
could
always
just
stop
paying
the
rent.
he
doesn't
have
to
leave
the
premises.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
can
i
ask
you,
have
you
accepted
the
majority's
reasoning
in
the
dersch
case,
the
seventh
circuit
case,
with
respect
to
2805(f)?
you
haven't
raised
that
argument
in
your
brief,
so
obviously,
you
have
accepted
their
view
that
2805(f)
doesn't
apply
to
the
right
to
preserve
your
claims
of
improper--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
seventh
circuit
said
there's
no
implied
right
of
action
under
2805(f).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
would
have
thought
your
strongest
argument
would
have
been
that,
if
we
have
a
statutory
right
not
to
waive
any
of
our
federal
or
state
rights,
if
there
has
been
a
non-renewal
on
reasonable
terms,
there
has
been
a
breach
of
that
obligation
under
the
statute,
then
you
had
a
right
to
be
renewed
under
reasonable
terms,
and
if
they
are
giving
you
unreasonable
terms
--
"unreasonable"
being
defined
within
the
statutory
constraints
--
they
impose
conditions
that
were
imposed
in
bad
faith
to
drive
you
out;
those
are
the
two
conditions
--
then
you
had
a
right
to
sue
for
that,
non-renewal,
because
you
had
a
right
to
renew
on
reasonable
terms.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
why
didn't
you
make
the
argument
in
your
briefs?
that's
why
i
was
asking
you
whether
you
agreed
with
the
seventh
circuit's
reasoning,
and
that's
why
you
didn't
raise
it
or
--
what
am
i
missing,
that's
making
that
argument
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--one
that
you
relied
upon?
