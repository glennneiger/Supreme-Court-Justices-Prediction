mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
pmpa
to
regulate
two
specific,
but
important,
actions:
franchisors'
termination
of
the
franchise
prior
to
the
conclusion
of
the
franchise
term
and
the
franchisors'
non-renewal
of
the
franchise
relationship
at
the
end
of
the
agreement's
term.
the
statute
responded
to
complaints
about
franchisors
exercising
broad
contractual
rights
to
terminate
the
franchise
relationship
that
was
not
addressed
by
--
for
trivial
violations
or
at
will,
that
was
not
previously
addressed
by
state
law.
but
congress
left
all
other
aspects
of
the
franchise
relationship
to
state
law.
because
the
term
"terminate",
at
the
very
least,
requires
an
end,
we
and
the
united
states
agree
that
the
first
circuit
erred
in
upholding
a
so-called
constructive
termination,
where
the
dealers
continued
to
receive
each
element
of
the
statutory
franchise
--
that
is
the
premises,
the
trademark,
and
fuel--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--we
don't
believe
that
in
contract
law
constructive
termination
exists
or
in
the
analogous
state
franchise
statutes
that
existed
at
the
time
that
the
congress
enacted
the
pmpa.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
right.
the
term
"constructive
eviction"
we
would
--
we
believe
does
exist,
along
with
"constructive
discharge".
but
the
precise
terms
that
congress
used
here
were
u.c.c.,
in
particular,
and
from
state
franchise
statutes.
we--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
it's
not
so
much
that
we
differ;
it's
that
our
fallback
position
is
the
same
as
the
government's,
but
they
do
not
endorse
our
primary
position,
which
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
constructive
termination.
we
believe
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
recognize
constructive
termination
in
this
context
for
three
reasons:
the
first
is
the
one
i
already
mentioned,
is
that,
in
the
most
analogous
context
that
existed
at
the
time
congress
acted,
state
franchise
statutes
that
used
terms
like
"terminate",
"non-renew",
"cancel",
the
terms
that
congress
used,
there
was
--
the
notion
of
constructive
termination
was
frankly
unheard
of.
even
today,
under
those
statutes
it
is
not
a
well-accepted
concept,
having
been
rejected
by
approximately
half
the
states
to
have
considered
it.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
on
the
contrary,
your
honor.
it's
not
so
much
--
there
isn't
a
mitigation
of
damages,
any
more
than
an
employee
claiming
constructive
discharge,
for
example,
would
be
mitigating
damages
by
staying
in
her
job.
the
settled
rule,
even
when
constructive
claims
are
recognized,
is
that
an
employee
claiming--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--constructive
discharge
must
move
out,
must
quit
the
job,
and
the
tenant
claiming
constructive
eviction
must
leave
the
job.
that
is
the
nature,
even
where
constructive
discharge
and
constructive
termination
--
constructive
eviction
claims,
are
recognized.
that
is
the
settled
rule.
if
you
have
something
else,
for
example,
there's
a
breach
of
contract,
you
can
claim
your
breach
of
contract,
and
you
can
sue
for
damages
while
continuing
to
operate.
but
if
you're
going
to
claim
that
it
wasn't
a
mere
breach
of
contract,
but
in
fact
it
was
a
constructive
termination,
that
you've
lost
all
the
rights
to
continue
to
operate
--
you
may
not
get
fuel,
you
may
not
get--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
have
confused
breach
with
termination.
the
failure
to
give
the
rights
on
the
terms
provided
in
the
lease
or
the
agreement
would
be
a
breach
of
contract.
but
termination
in
contract
law
has
long
been
understood
to
be
something
entirely
different,
which
is
the
absolute
refusal
to
provide
the
elements
such
that
it's
obvious
to
any
observer
that
there
is
--
these
elements
will
not
be
resumed.
corbin
on
contracts,
for
example,
describes
termination
as
occurring
"when
either
party,
pursuant
to
a
power
created
by
agreement
or
law,
puts
an
end
to
the
contract.
"
"extinguishing
future
obligations
of
both
parties
to
the
agreement.
"
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
pardon.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
williston
didn't
actually
address
that.
corbin
addresses
it
because
he
talks
about
the
u.c.c.,
and
the
u.c.c.
in
turn
says:
"on
termination,
all
obligations"--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it's
the
sine
qua
non
of
any
termination
under
this
statute,
we
would
believe,
if
you
recognize
constructive
termination.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
right.
that's
why
it
would
have
to
be
a
determination
of
one
of
the
three
franchise
elements.
the
way
the
statute's
written,
each
of
the
different--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
right.
each
of
these
separate
elements
is
treated
as
a
franchise,
and
you
can
have
the
termination
of
any
one
of
the
three,
and
that
is
a
termination
of
the
franchise--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--defined
within
the
agreement.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
in
our
view
the
result
would
be
the
same
in
both.
neither
of
those
would
be
a
termination,
because--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
in
our
view
it
has
to
be
the
franchisor
that
terminates,
not
the
franchisee.
but
if
one
accepts
the
construct
of
the
constructive
termination,
those
would
be
different
results,
because,
at
the
very
least,
termination
requires
an
end
to
one
of
the
franchise
elements.
and
the
individual
who
sues,
having
not
--
having
--
still
receiving
all
the
franchise
elements,
hasn't
been
terminated
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
but
the
key
thing
is
he
actually
has
a
breach
of
contract
action.
raising
the
price
unreasonably
on
an
open
price
term
has
long,
uniformly,
comprehensively
been
addressed
by
state
law,
like
u.c.c.
2-305.
so
the
answer
always
is
you
can
sue
for
breach
of
contract.
and
congress
wasn't
worried
about
the
fact
there
might
be
breaches
of
contract
that
ordinary
contract
remedies
don't
sufficiently
remedy.
congress's
concern
was
the
exercise
of
contractually
broad
rights
to
terminate
and
non-renew
the
relationship.
and--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
i
think
the
government
doesn't
think
that
constructive
termination
extends
to
cases
where
you
continue
to
receive
all
three
franchise
elements.
they
would
believe
that
constructive
termination
requires
at
least
one
of
those
three
elements
to
end,
just
as
it
does--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
our
position,
yes.
the
franchisor
has
to
be
the
one
that
exercises
the
termination.
the
notion
of
constructive
termination,
where
the
franchisee
effectively
abandons
the
premises
in
response
to
conditions
it
thought
intolerable,
that
that
is
a
constructive
termination,
and
it
was
not
a
concept
that
existed
under
the
most
analogous
statutes
under
the
contract
law
from
which
the
terms
"termination",
"non-renewal"--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
right,
and
precisely
because
all
those
things
were
comprehensively
and
uniformly
addressed
by
contract
law,
uniform
contract
law.
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
it
does
not
reduce
--
i
mean,
because
we
--
we
agree
that
there
can
be
a
termination
by
deed
as
well
as
by
words.
for
example,
the
outright
refusal
to
provide
the
fuel,
provide
fuel
at
all,
would
be
a
termination.
you
don't
have
to
say
we
are
hereby
rescinding
all
of
your
rights
under
the
contract.
at
some
point,
it
becomes
obvious,
clear
to
any
observer.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
if
--
no,
our
position
would
be
that
where
the
station
owner
abandons
in
response,
that
would
not
be
an
actual
termination.
the
government
would
take
the
view
that
that's
a
constructive
termination.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
the
problem
this
gets
you--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
it's
particularly
--
i
mean,
since
the
franchise
is
described
as
having
three
elements--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--he
can
continue
taking
the
other
two
elements.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
there
has
been
a
termination
of
the
franchise,
which
is
defined
as
having
three
--
effectively
three
separate
franchise
agreements.
each
of
the
different
elements
is
treated
like
it's
a
different
contract
or
a
different
agreement.
so
if
you
terminate
one,
there
has
been
a
termination
of
the
franchise,
because
the
franchise
is
defined
to
encompass
all
three
elements.
you've
got
to
get--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
oftentimes
these
are
in
separate
contracts,
and
in
this
case
there
are
actually
two
contracts
as
opposed
to
three.
and,
yes,
the
way
the
statute's--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
one
could
imagine
a
situation
where
the
trademark
is
withdrawn,
but
you
can
continue
to
be
a
lessee
of
the
premises
and
market
the
fuel
as
an
unbranded--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
but
the
contract
could
be
written
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
the
way
congress
wrote
the
statute
was
to
define
the
franchise--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
sometimes
they
are,
for
very
good
reasons,
written
as
independent
contracts
and
sometimes
they
will
be
dependent
contracts,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
parties.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
an
implicit
termination
is
one
that's
objectively
viewed
as
ending
the
nature
of
the
relationship
of
the
parties.
the
contract's
over.
you
no
longer
have
the
right.
fuel
will
not
be
coming.
you
may
not
use
our
trademark,
or
you
may
no
longer
use
our
premises.
a
constructive
termination,
as
i
understand
the
concept,
could
be
something
--
and
this
is
the
difficulty
with
the
concept
--
something
like
charging
too
much,
an
excessive
price,
which
is
a
breach
of
contract,
which
would
prevent
a
reasonable
franchisee
from
continuing
to
accept
that
element.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
as
good
as--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
that's
correct.
and
the
difficulty
is
--
that
would
be
a
breach
of
contract
remediable
under
state
law.
and
the
difficulty
is,
the
moment
you
move
this
into
the
issue
of
price,
suddenly
the
issue
of
price
--
how
much
the
franchisor
can
charge
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
in
a
statute
that
just
talks
about
termination
and
non-renewal.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
oh,
in
fact,
in
order
to
be
constructive
termination,
something
would
have
to
be
a
breach
of
contract.
i
think
the
government
would
concede
that.
it
has
to
be
wrongful.
for
example,
insisting
on
your
ordinary
contractual
rights
cannot
be
a
constructive
termination.
it
must
also
be
a
breach
of
contract,
which
is
precisely
why
it
doesn't
add
very
much
to
--
it's
unlikely
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate
it,
because
those
things
that
already
breached
the
contract
were
already
addressed
by
state
law.
there
was
no--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
actual
damages
here
--
the
amounts
were
overlapping.
and
so
everything
that
they
will
recover,
the
amounts
of
compensation
recovered
for
termination,
are
covered
by
the
breach
of
contract
claim.
the
difference
between
the
two
is
about
$1.4
million
worth
of
attorney's
fees
and
expert
costs
that
are
covered
by
the
pmpa,
but
would
not
be
provided
under
contract
law.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it
may
do
--
one,
issue
the
notice
that's
required,
say
that
they
are
terminating,
that
this
is
--
in
the
words
of
contract,
we
are
extinguishing
the
future
operations;
or
they
can
engage
in
conduct
which
an
objectively
reasonable
observer
would
have
to
understand
gives
that
exact
same
message.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it's
an
actual
termination.
and
the
problem
is,
once
you
get
into
--
you
get
into
constructive
termination,
you
get
the
question
of:
well,
is
it
a
constructive
termination
to
raise
the
price
by
1
percent
or,
as
the
case
entirely
involves
market--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
sometimes
there
is
an
unclear
line
between
what
some
people
call
an
implicit
or
informal
actual
termination--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--and
what
other
people
would
call
a
constructive
termination.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
but
i
don't
think
--
in
the
highly
unusual
case
of
$1,000
per
gallon
or
things
like
that,
that
might
be
the
case.
but
in
the
ordinary
cases
you
see
a
1
percent
increase
in
gas
prices
in
highly
volatile
petroleum
markets.
for
example,
in
this
case,
where
shell
raised
its
prices
considerably
but
was
still
charging
less
than
exxon
and
chevron,
as
the
joint
appendix
225
and
237
made
clear,
that's
what
you
end
up
with
as
claims
for
constructive
termination,
if
you
recognize
constructive
termination.
but
congress
was
worried
about
actual
terminations,
the
exercise
of
contractual
rights,
broad
contractual
rights,
to
terminate
that
were
formerly
not
regulated,
not
breaches
of
contract
that
were
already
regulated
by
--
comprehensively,
by
state
law.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you.
i
believe
the
debate
in
this
case
comes
down
to
about
three
issues:
the
first
is
what
is
the
relevant
background
principle
we
think
congress
was
looking
to
when
it
used
the
words
"terminate",
"non-renew",
and
"cancel"
in
the
statute.
we
think
the
most
analogous
background
principles
they
would
have
been
looking
to
were
contract
law
and
the
state
franchise
statutes
that
existed
at
the
time
congress
acted.
i--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
there
was
a
deficiency
in
the
common
law,
but
it
was
limited
to
one
point,
and
that
was
termination
and
non-renewal.
it
wasn't
that
breaches
of
contract
--
and
as
the
government
has
explained,
a
breach
of
contract
here
is
a
precondition
to
a
constructive
termination
claim
--
were
insufficiently
remedied
by
state
law.
that
was
not
the
issue
before
congress.
the
issue
before
congress
was
that
there
was
a
contractual
right
to
terminate
at
will
or
for
trivial
reasons
or
to
non-renew
for
no
reason
or
bad
reasons
even,
and
that
is
what
congress
regulated,
was
terminations
and
non-renewals,
in
that
sense,
not
breaches
of
contract
that
turned
out
to
be
really
bad.
the
second
thing
is
that
because
there
was
a
comprehensive
state
remedy,
there
is
particularly
little
reason
to
read
this
statute,
this
narrow
statute,
expansively,
particularly
given
that
this
is
an
expressly
preemptive
--
a
potentially
conflict
preemption
statute,
which
could
have
the
effect
of
displacing
state
law.
when
you're
looking
at
a
statute
that's
narrowly
looking
at
termination
or
non-renewal,
you
would
not
ordinarily
expand
those
terms
to
include
really
bad
breaches
of
contract,
because
that
has
the
potential
to
displace
state
statutory
and
potentially
state
common
law
under
the
preemption
clause.
and,
finally,
the
last
piece
that
comes
up
is
the
problem
of
evasion.
the
issue
becomes
sort
of,
well,
people
can
just
get
around
this
statute
if
there
is
no
constructive
termination
cause
of
action.
and
the
answer
to
that
is:
there
is
no
problem
with
evasion,
because
everything
that's
covered
by
constructive
termination
has
to
be
a
breach
of
contract.
state
law
has
this
comprehensively
covered.
increasing
the
price
terms
on
an
open
price
term?
u.c.c.
2-305,
under
which
plaintiff's
recovered
here,
has
that
covered.
so
the
--
extending
the
federal
statute
really
adds
very
little.
and
the
second
point
is
that
even
under
the
pmpa
today,
constructive
termination
has
been
rejected
--
every
--
except
in
the
narrow
area
of
assignments,
under
the
theory
that
an
assignment
followed
by
a
breach
is
somehow
a
constructive
termination,
a
theory
which
i
don't
think
we
or
the
government
thinks
makes
any
sense.
but
that's
where
it
exists.
and
yet
there's
no
record
outside
the
area
of
assignment
of
these
grand
evasions
by
boosting
up
all
the
prices
in
violation
of
the
contract.
and
the
risk
of
expanding
constructive
termination
here
is
it
projects
federal
law
into
deciding
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
prohibit
particular
price
terms,
particular
conditions,
particular
things
dealing
with
the
rent
and
the
premises,
something
that
congress
stayed
away
from
and
left
to
the
states.
what
congress
regulated
here
were
the
narrow
issues
of
termination
and
non-renewal,
not
the
substantive
content
of
the
franchise
relationship.
if
there
are
no
questions,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
with
respect
to
termination
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
with
respect
to
non-renewal
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
