but
that
--
on
that
point,
the
government
differs
with
you.
the
government
says,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
there
can
be
such
a
thing
as
constructive
termination,
and
you
must
terminate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
position
is
that
the
franchisor
has
to
be
the
one
to
terminate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
the
franchisor
can
do
outrageous
things
--
triple
the
rent,
double
the
price
of
the
fuel
--
and
you
would
say,
even
so,
there's
--
that
doesn't
count
as
a
termination
because
the
franchisor
hasn't
terminated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
could
you,
mr.
lamken,
straighten
out
what
happened
in
the
district
court?
because
i
take
it
there
was
an
award
for
breach
of
contract
as
well
as
one
for
termination
and
they
were
in
an
identical
amount.
so
what
happened
to
the
breach
of
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
award?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
rather
significant
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
o'neil,
i
thought
that
there
were
some
cases,
landlord-tenant
cases,
where
the
tenant
is
not
required
to
leave
the
premises
because,
as
awful
as
the
situation
is,
the
tenant
has
no
place
to
go.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
--
is
there
any
area
of
the
law,
other
than
this
one,
if
you
are
right,
in
which
a
termination
includes
a
non-termination;
that
is,
where
a
constructive
termination
includes
situations
where
the
operation
continues?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
--
well,
you
sought
an
injunction,
but
judge
zobel
thought
it
was
--
it
came
much
too
late.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
explain
to
me
--
the
question
i
brought
up
before
--
what
was
the
difference
of
the
elements
between
the
recovery
that
the
jury
gave
for
constructive
termination
and
for
breach
of
contract?
