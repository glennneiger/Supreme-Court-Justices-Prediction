mr.
lamken,
am
i
wrong
that
you
don't
really
object
to
the
recognition
of
"constructive
termination",
if
that
phrase
is
used
the
way
it
is
used
elsewhere
in
contract
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
if
you
had
a
lease
and
the
landlord
fails
to
provide
heat,
that
you
can
move
out
and
he
will
be
deemed
to
have
constructively
evicted
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
what
happens
after
that?
don't
you
take
the
position
that
the
station
owner
then
has
to
refuse
all
other
elements
of
the
contract,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait,
wait--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you
said
there
is
a
termination
by
the
company
if
it
fails
to
provide
one
of
the
three
basic
elements,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
termination?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
response
has
to
be
made
by
the
station
owner?
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
continue
to
take
the
other
two
elements?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
has
still
been
a
termination?
justice
antonin
scalia
whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
this
is
all
one
contract,
isn't
it?
you
are
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
saying
you
can
terminate
a
third
of
the
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
are
not
contingent
on
each
other,
so
that
at
any
time
the
company
could
terminate
one
of
them
and
stick
the
station
owner
with
the
other
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
continues
to
be.
you
must
continue
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
sounds
like
a
very
strange
way
to
write
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
writing
the
statute.
i'm
talking
about
writing
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
really
think
that
that's
how
those
contracts
should
be
interpreted?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
company
have
to
do
in
your
view
to
effect
a
genuine
termination
and
not
a
constructive
termination?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
constructive
termination?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
conduct
is
you
stopped
sending
me
the
gas
you
are
supposed
to
send
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
understand
what
your
number
two
consists
of
unless
it
consists
of
an
act
that
the
other
side
would
call
constructive
--
or
the
government
would
call
constructive
termination.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
there's
always
an
unclear
line
between
those
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
franchisor
stops
delivering
gas.
there
are
three
--
three
different
obligations
under
the
contract.
what
does
the
franchisee
have
to
do
to
show
that
he
has
accepted
it
as
a
termination?
why
does
he
have
to
leave
the
premises?
that's
another
contract,
is
--
is
what
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--up
--
up
to
that
point,
which
supposedly
a
jury
can
find,
the
tipping
point
where
a
reasonable
franchisee
would
abandon
--
up
until
then,
he
has
a
contract
claim,
right?
and
then
at
that
magical
point,
the
contract
claim
is
converted
into
a
claim
under
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
contract
claim
alone
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
"in
the
context
of
termination"
is
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
background
principles
were
they?
i
don't
know
about
constructive
termination.
there
was
constructive
discharge
and
constructive
eviction.
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
do
about
the
claim
of
--
of
the
--
the
petitioners
that
only
one
of
the
three
contracts
has
been
terminated?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
two
continue
--
continue
in
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
your
--
your
approach
puts
--
puts
the
company
--
the
oil
company
in
a
very
strange
position.
it
doesn't
know
whether
it
has
a
contract
or
not.
it
--
the
contract
is
terminated
if
your
client
says
it's
terminated.
if
he
doesn't
say
it's
terminated,
it's
not
terminated.
i
mean,
a
very
weird
contract
where
you
--
you're
subject
to
the
whim
of
the
other
party
as
to
whether
the
contract
continues
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know.
they
--
you
know,
if
they
knew
that
they
were
pulling
out
and
--
and
were
claiming
a
termination,
they
might
have
been
looking
for
somebody
else
to
take
over
the
franchise.
