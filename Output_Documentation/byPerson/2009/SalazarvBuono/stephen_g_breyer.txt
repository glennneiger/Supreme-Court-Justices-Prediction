justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
why
that's
the
issue
before
us.
look,
procedurally
this
is
a
little
boring,
but
it
seems
pretty
well
established
in
the
law.
i
read
a
case
called
toledo
scale
and
then
there
are
a
bunch
of
cases
on
jurisdiction,
which
i'm
not
going
to
name
them
because
i'm
sure
you
looked
at
them,
but
travelers
indemnity,
et
cetera.
and
it
seems
to
me
they
make
absolutely
clear
that
once
a
litigant,
you
and
the
others,
have
had
an
opportunity
to
raise
a
matter
and
now
the
case
is
over,
done,
but
for
an
injunction
that
stays
in,
all
those
issues
that
they
previously
raised
or
could
have
raised
are
gone;
that
the
only
question
left
is
whether
the
government
has
complied
with
the
injunction.
so
i
read
the
injunction.
the
injunction
says
the
government
is
enjoined
from
permitting
the
display
of
the
latin
cross,
period.
once
this
law
takes
effect
and
you
follow
it,
you
are
violating
that
injunction.
you
don't
need
nine
proceedings
to
see
that.
you
are
violating
it.
now,
if
you
don't
like
the
injunction
because
you
think
the
statute
has
so
changed
the
circumstances
there
is
no
need
for
it,
there
is
a
remedy.
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
you
say:
judge,
change
the
injunction.
but
you
haven't
done
that.
and
therefore,
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
is
right
in
saying
when
you
carry
the
statute
into
effect,
you
are
violating
this
injunction,
which
i
think
no
one
could
say
you
aren't.
now,
now,
that
--
that's
a
very
technical
boring
issue.
i
don't
know
why
we
heard
this
issue,
but
i
don't
see
how
we
could
reach
any
other
issue
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
are
talking
about
the
first.
we
are
talking
about
the
first
injunction.
the
first
injunction
says
that
the
government
may
not
permit
display.
you've
covered
it
up,
so
you
are
not
permitting
display.
you
are
in
compliance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
the
plaintiff
here
said
is
that
when
you
comply
with
this
statute,
you
will
not
be
in
compliance,
because
you
will
turn
it
over
to
the
vfw
that
will
uncover
it,
so
you
will
have
permitted
it
to
be
displayed.
now,
that
i
can
see
is
an
issue
before
us.
but
i
don't
see
any
other
issue
before
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
just
i
want
to
just
get
this
clear
procedurally.
i'm
sorry.
it'll
take
one
more
second.
as
i
read
this,
there
is
no
modification
of
any
injunction.
what
the
--
what
the
respondent
asked
for,
he
said:
judge,
either
hold
that
the
transfer
violates
the
current
injunction,
or
modify
the
injunction.
then
what
the
district
court
did
do
is
he
said
the
proposed
transfer
violates
the
permanent
injunction.
the
permanent
injunction
is
in
the,
like,
the
third
paragraph
of
the
july
24th
order,
and
it
says,
you
are
permanently
enjoined
from
permitting
the
display
of
the
latin
cross.
therefore,
he
rejected
the
need
to
modify
it,
and
held
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
violates
the
injunction
as
written,
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
that.
so
is
there
any
question
in
this
case
of
modifying?
is
there
any
question
other
than
the
one
that
i
think
justice
scalia
was
taking
a
good
argument
about,
whether
the
proposed
statute
violates
the
july
24th
injunction?
that's
what
the
case
is
about.
or
why
am
i
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
what
the
judge
did.
he
said:
the
motion
to
enforce
the
july
24th
injunction
is
granted.
he
said:
buono's
motion
to
amend
it
is
denied.
then
he
did
two
other
things,
which
he
listed
some
people
and
he
said
they
are
enjoined
from
implementing
the
law.
now,
i
take
it
that
those
paragraphs
3
and
4
are
an
implementation
of
the
july
24
injunction
which
he
granted,
not
a
new
injunction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
the
issue
here
that
we
were
just
possibly
debating.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
district
judge
might
lawfully
enforce
an
old
injunction
in
the
manner
he
did,
which
was
to
add
paragraphs
3
and
4.
that
question
you
concede
is
here.
