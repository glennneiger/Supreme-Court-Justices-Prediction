justice
antonin
scalia
general
kagan,
before
you
go
--
go
on
with
your
argument,
you
presented
it
as
--
as
though
the
issue
before
us
is
the
--
the
conveying
of
the
land.
but
is
it?
what
this
was
was
simply
an
affirmation
of
the
prior
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
prior
injunction
had
not
been
mooted
by
the
--
by
the
transfer
of
the
land.
so
isn't
really
the
issue
whether
that
--
that
prior
injunction,
when
the
land
did
indeed
belong
to
the
government,
whether
that
prior
injunction
was
valid?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
what
we
have
before
us
is
the
court
of
appeals'
affirmation
of
the
prior
injunction,
which
applied
to
a
cross
on
public
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
if
i
--
if
i
thought
the
display
wasn't
unconstitutional,
the
transfer
would
a
fortiori
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
unreasonable
to
read
the
injunction
to
say
the
government
shall
not
permit
anybody
to
display
a
cross
on
that
land
no
matter
who
owns
the
land.
i
assume
the
injunctions
meant
you
will
not
permit
the
cross
to
be
displayed
on
this
parcel
of
government
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
it
was
that,
but
the
question
is
whether
it
was
a
permissible
amendment
by
the
government
of
the
situation.
of
course,
i
will
stipulate
that
the
government
was
trying
to
arrange
it
so
that
the
cross
could
remain
there.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
was
--
it
was
evading
the
injunction.
i
mean,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
the
injunction
clearly
applied
to
the
erection
of
a
cross
on
private
land
that
the
government
had
--
had
transferred.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
will
--
i
will
concede
that
the
obvious
purpose
of
that
was
to
avoid
being
in
violation
of
the
injunction.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
cross
doesn't
honor
non-christians
who
fought
in
the
war?
is
that
--
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
does
it
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
erected
as
a
war
memorial.
i
assume
it
is
erected
in
honor
of
all
of
the
war
dead.
it's
the
--
the
cross
is
the
--
is
the
most
common
symbol
of
--
of
--
of
the
resting
place
of
the
dead,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
--
what
would
you
have
them
erect?
a
cross
--
some
conglomerate
of
a
cross,
a
star
of
david,
and
you
know,
a
moslem
half
moon
and
star?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you
can
leap
from
that
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
war
dead
that
that
cross
honors
are
the
christian
war
dead.
i
think
that's
an
outrageous
conclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
the
government
ever
turned
down
--
let's
say
the
jewish
war
veterans
request
to
put
up
a
war
memorial
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
am
talking
about
--
on
this
site?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
this
site,
where
there
already
was
a
memorial,
but
suppose
the
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
i
don't
agree
with
you,
that
--
that
every
time
the
government
allows
any
religious
symbol
to
be
erected,
it
has
to
allow
all
religious
symbols
to
be
erected
at
the
same
place,
so
long
as
it
is
--
it
is
not
discriminatory
in
--
in
accepting
or
rejecting
requests
to
erect
religious
symbols
in
different
places.
i
don't
see
why
the
government
is
convicted
of
being
discriminatory.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
you
don't
--
and
they
--
were
both
of
them
proposed
by
a
private
group,
such
as
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
was
erected
by
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars.
i
mean,
do
you
know
of
any
instance
in
which
jewish
war
veterans
or
if
there
is
an
organization
of
muslim
war
veterans,
requested
to
erect
a
memorial
on
public
land,
it
was
turned
down?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
don't
see
why
they
all
have
to
be
on
the
same
piece
of
land,
in
--
in
order
for
the
government
to
be
impartial.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
you
are
saying
that,
and
you
are
saying
that
this
has
to
be
a
public
forum.
in
fact,
i'm
not
even
sure
your
--
your
brief
would
limit
it
to
religious
symbols.
you
say
it
has
to
be
an
open
forum.
right?
