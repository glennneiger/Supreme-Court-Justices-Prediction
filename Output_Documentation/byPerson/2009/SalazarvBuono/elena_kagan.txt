ms.
elena
kagan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
establishment
clause
does
not
prohibit
the
sensible
action
congress
took
in
enacting
section
8121
and
thereby
divesting
the
federal
government
of
the
property
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
district
court
gave
congress
two
basic
options
when
it
found
the
sunrise
rock
war
memorial
unconstitutional.
first,
congress
could
accede
to
permanently
removing
the
memorial,
ending
the
dispute,
but
also
doing
away
with
a
memorial
that
for
75
years
had
commemorated
america's
fallen
soldiers
and
had
acquired
deep
meaning
for
the
veterans
in
the
community.
or,
second,
congress--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
don't
believe
that
there
is,
justice
ginsburg.
there
are
national
memorials
that
have
some
religious
content
to
them.
there
is,
for
example,
a
statue
of
a
catholic
priest
holding
a
very
large
cross,
but
most
national
memorials
are
--
are
not
religious.
some
are.
the
--
the
--
you
know,
i
think
that
it
would
even
be
possible,
for
example,
to
make
a
church
or
a
synagogue
a
national
memorial.
if
--
if
dr.
king's
church
were
selected
as
a
national
memorial
because
of
--
in
order
to
honor
dr.
king,
i
think
that
would
be
permissible.
if--
ms.
elena
kagan
--yes,
and
there
is
at
least
one
religiously
oriented
memorial
that
i
know
of,
which
is
a
priest
holding
a
cross.
ms.
elena
kagan
very
little,
justice
alito.
in
fact,
it
has
no
consequences
in
terms
of
the
government's
supervision
of
the
land.
national
memorials
can
be
on
private
land
or
on
public
land.
if
they
are
on
private
land,
nothing
goes
along
with
the
designation
by
way
of
more
extensive
regulation
or
supervision
by
the
national
park
service.
ms.
elena
kagan
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars
here
could
in
fact
take
down
this
memorial
once
it
is
transferred
to
them,
if
the
court
allows
that
transfer.
ms.
elena
kagan
the--
ms.
elena
kagan
--no,
no,
no.
the
reversionary
clause
which
is
at
issue,
which
is
a
part
of
the
transfer
legislation,
says
that
the
vfw
will
have
to
put
up
a
veterans
memorial,
but
the
content
of
that
veterans
memorial
is
entirely
up
to
the
vfw.
ms.
elena
kagan
yes,
that's
correct.
if
the
vfw
took
down
this
memorial
and
substituted
a
different
memorial,
that
memorial
would
not
at
that
point
have
national
memorial
status.
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
--
the
vfw
could
in
fact
take
down
the
memorial
or
whether
it's
designation
as
a
national
memorial
would
prevent
them
from
doing
that.
i
think
it's
quite
clear,
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
that
the
section
1369,
which
is
what
the
respondents
point
to,
would
not
prevent
the
vfw
from
taking
down
this
memorial,
if
it
so
wanted
to,
because
1369
applies
only
to
national
memorials
which
are
on
public
property.
if
the
transfer
were
to
take
place,
of
course,
it
would
not
be
on
public
property,
or
it
would
not
be
under
the
supervision,
in
any
way,
of
the
federal
government.
so--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
there
is
a
question
in
this
case
whether
the
prior
injunction
was
valid
and
was
the
display
itself
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
ms.
elena
kagan
but
the
government
argued
below
that
that
question
had
been
mooted
out
because
of
the
passage
of
the
transfer
legislation.
ms.
elena
kagan
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
no,
but
it
remands
the
government--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
think
what
you
have
before
you,
there
were
of
course
two
stages
in
this
litigation,
and
the
first
stage
declared
the
display
unconstitutional,
and
then
the
second
stage
declared
the
transfer
as
well
unconstitutional
or
at
least
a
violation
of
the
prior
injunction.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
that
is
correct.
we
do
think
that
the
issue
before
the
court
now
is
the
congressional
legislation
which
has
been
passed,
which
is
the
transfer
legislation,
that
that
has
essentially
changed
the
situation
on
the
ground,
so
that
no
longer
is
the
question
whether
the
display
from
the
--
whether
the
display
by
the
government
would
be
constitutional,
but
only
whether
the
government
has
the
ability
to
transfer
this
property
and
--
and
to
give
up
all
supervision,
all
control
over
it.
so
that
the
message--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
breyer,
i
think
we
are
in
perfect
compliance
with
the
injunction
and
have
been
since
the
day
it
was
issued.
now,
in
fact
there
were
two
injunctions
issued.
as
i
said,
there
were
two
stages
of
this
litigation.
the
first
stage
ended
in
an
injunction
that
said
do
not
display
the
war
memorial.
in
compliance
with
that
injunction,
the
next
day
the
war
memorial
was
covered.
so
we
were
in
compliance
from
the
--
from
the
moment
that
the
decision
issued.
now
then,
respondents
went
back
to
the
district
court
and
asked
for
additional
relief,
because
what
--
during
the
first
court
of
appeals
hearing,
congress
had
passed
this
transfer
statute.
and
so
the
respondents
went
back
and
said:
in
addition
to
the
injunction
that
you
previously
gave
us,
we
essentially
need
a
new
injunction
and
that
injunction
will
be
to
stop
the
transfer.
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
much
more
than
an
enforcement
action.
ms.
elena
kagan
that
is
correct.
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
breyer,
again,
the
respondents
had
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
in
order
not
just
to
enforce
the
injunction,
which
said
don't
display
the
statue,
but
to
get
additional
relief,
which
was
don't
transfer
the
statue.
if
the
transfer
had
taken
place,
it
would
no
longer
have
been
the
government's
property,
the
government
would
not
have
permitted
or
not
permitted
the
display
because
it
wasn't
the
government's
property
to
permit
or
not
to
permit
the
display.
ms.
elena
kagan
and
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
said
--
when
this
came
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
was
asked
by
the
respondents.
in
order
to
rule
on
the
transfer
legislation,
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
said:
we
are
not
going
to
do
that;
that's
a
decision
for
another
day,
a
separate
decision.
because
of
that,
the
respondents
had
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
had
to
get
the
district
court
essentially
to
modify
the
injunction
and
to
provided
additional
relief.
now,
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
the
standing
question
here,
just
the
standing
question
is
precluded,
and
our
view
is
that
it
is
not
preclude,
because
the
way
the
government
views
this
is
it's
one
entire
litigation
in
which
all
issues
are
open.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
either
this
is
one
litigation,
in
which
all
cases
are
before
the
court,
or
it's
too
entirely
separate
litigations,
in
which
case
the
court
has
an
obligation
to
independently
consider
the
standing
question.
ms.
elena
kagan
it
couldn't
have
been
a
motion
to
enforce
the
judgment
because
the
government
was
in
compliance
with
the
judgment
and
because
the
ninth
circuit
had
said
that
the
question
that
respondents
were
raising
was
an
entirely
separate
issue
for
another
day,
according
to
the
ninth
circuit.
ms.
elena
kagan
mr.
chief
justice,
we
could
not
have
taken
the
standing
question
to
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
procedural
posture
that
the
case
was
at
at
that
point.
it
would
have
been
really
an
irresponsible
action
on
our
part
to
ask
this
court
to
address
the
standing
issue
after
the
first
court
of
appeals
judgment
where
--
where
we
knew
that
we
were
going
to
relitigate
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
transfer.
we
couldn't
have
come
to
you,
we
wouldn't
have
come
to
you,
as
the
solicitor
general's
office
and
asked
you
to
adjudicate
a
decision
that
was
as
likely
as
not
going
to
be
irrelevant.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
you
are
right
that
we
could
have,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
would
have
used
our
discretion,
in
a
sense
knocking
on
this
court's
door,
the
solicitor
general's
office
discretion,
in
order
to
ask
you
to
decide
a
question
that
was
as
likely
or
not
going
to
be
completely
irrelevant
depending
on
what
happened
with
respect
to
the
transfer
statute.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
appreciate
the
distinction
that
you
are
making
between
the
standing
question
and
the
merits
question
and
i
think
you
are
exactly
right
as
to
that
point.
but
whatever
the
question
as
to
whether
we
have
given
up
the
standing
question,
certainly
there
is
no
such
question
on
the
merits
of
this
--
of
the
validity
of
this
transfer.
but
with
respect,
i
think
that
the
standing
question
is
--
is
not
the
way
you
described
it.
and
it's
partly
because
we
couldn't
have
come
to
this
court
or
we
wouldn't
have
come,
is
a
better
way
to
say
it.
we
would
have
thought
that
it
was
not
the
right
kind
of
position
to
ask
the
court
to
take
certiorari
on
a
question
that
basically
was
very
likely,
we
thought,
was
very
likely
to
go
away.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
but
we
didn't,
because
we
did
think
that
congress
had
acted
appropriately
and
that
the
congressional
act
was
valid,
and
continue
to
do
so,
continue
to
think
that
this--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
breyer.
ms.
elena
kagan
you
--
you
are
incorrect,
justice
breyer,
because
in
addition
to
saying
this
violates
the
previously
given
injunction,
the
district
court
said,
you
are
enjoined
from
transferring
this
property
in
accordance
with
this
statute.
and
so
there
was
additional
relief,
additional
relief
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
was
additional
relief
that
it
wasn't
deciding
in
the
first
go-round,
and
that's
--
and
that
places
the
question,
the
merits
question
of
the
validity
of
this
transfer,
directly
before
the
court.
ms.
elena
kagan
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
certainly
limits
to
the
way
that
the
government
can
transfer
property,
and
i
would
give
you
a
few
of
them.
if
--
if
it
was
not
a
bona
fide
sale,
so
that
there
wasn't
proper
consideration;
if
--
if
there
was
only
religious
purpose,
so
that
there
was
no
secular
purpose
involved;
or
if
after
the
sale
the
property
was
indistinguishable
from
government
property,
so
that
everybody
naturally
thought
that
this
was
government
property.
in
those
cases--
ms.
elena
kagan
--in
fact,
it's
not
the
case
here.
and
it's
not
the
case
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
preserve
is
riddled
with
private
inholdings.
there
are
1800
private
landowners
with
--
excuse
me,
1,000
private
landowners
with
1800
plots
of
land.
ms.
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry?
ms.
elena
kagan
it's
about
--
between
the
state
and
the
private
inholdings,
it's
about
10
percent
of
the
total
area.
but
they
are
dotted
all
over
the
place.
so
tomorrow,
1,000
crosses
could
go
up
and
nobody
would
know
whether
they
were
on
private
land
or
on
public
land.
moreover--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
elena
kagan
we
do
not,
justice
stevens.
the
government
has
argued
--
argued
below
that
there
was
no
violation
prior
to
the
transfer
statute,
and
that
remains
the
government's
position,
although,
as
i
said
to
justice
scalia,
we
think
that
that
position
has
been
overtaken
by
events
and
that
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
the
transfer
statute.
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
say
to
the
chief
justice
that,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
private
inholdings
just
riddle
the
preserve,
the
government
is
perfectly
happy
to
put
up
signs
which
make
clear
that
the
--
the
plot
in
question
will
not
in
fact
be
the
government's,
but
will
be
the
vfw's.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
don't
think
that
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
preserve
would
put
up
signs
for
various
historic
or
cultural
or
otherwise
important--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
suspect
that
there
are
a
great
many
identification
signs
throughout
the
preserve,
although
i
don't
know
precisely
what
they
are.
and
this
would
be
one
of
those,
saying
essentially
that
there
is
this
war
memorial,
that
it
was
put
up
by
the
vfw,
that
it
is
maintained
and
owned
by
the
vfw.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
actually
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
it
would
be
easy
to
do.
i
was
out
there
three
or
four
weeks
ago.
the
superintendent
drove
me
to
the
site.
there
is
virtually
nobody
who
could
see
this
war
memorial
in
any
other
way
than
by
going
in
one
of
two
directions
on
cima
road.
and
you
could
put
signs
up
on
cima
road
that
said
exactly
what
you
were
going
to
see,
you
know,
in
100
yards
or
a
mile
or
whatever
it
was.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
we
were
not
going
to
put
up
signs,
it
would
still
be
valid.
so
i
should
make
that
completely
clear.
and
as
i
said,
there
are
many,
many
private
holdings
within
the
preserve,
people
who
could
put
up
whatever
religious
symbols
they
wanted
to.
one
simply
wouldn't
know
whether
it
was
on
private
land
or
on
other
land.
but
i
will
say,
in
addition
to
that,
that
the
preserve's
superintendent
himself
would
like
to
put
up
a
sign
essentially
telling
preserve
users
what
the
war
memorial
was
and
what
its
provenance
was.
if
some--
ms.
elena
kagan
--that's
correct,
justice
sotomayor.
but
i
have
to
say
that
that's
more
of
the
kind
of
sign
that
maybe
justice
ginsburg
had
in
mind,
which
is,
it's
smaller
and
you
would
have
to
go
right
up
to
the
war
memorial
in
order
to
see
it.
i
think
it
would
be
very
easy
to
put
up
signs
just
on
the
road
to
make
clear
that
anybody
who
was
in
the
area
would
know
that
this
was
land--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
small
plaque.
ms.
elena
kagan
the
small
plaque--
ms.
elena
kagan
--that's
correct.
ms.
elena
kagan
that's
correct.
and
as
i
said,
it's
something
that
the
superintendent
would
like
to
do
and
i
think
would
be
consistent
with
signage
in
the
area.
if
i--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
don't
believe
it
ever
came
up,
justice
sotomayor.
we
did
talk
about
it
in
our
merits
brief
to
this
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
ever
came
up
below.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
elena
kagan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
pick
up
right
there,
this
stand-alone
cross
was
erected
as
a
world
war
i
memorial
by
veterans
of
world
war
i
who
had
gone
to
the
desert
in
california
to
recuperate
and
to
restore
their
lives.
and
it
was
that
situation
that
the
--
that
the
congress
was
presented
with,
was
when
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
and
said
that
this
memorial
was
unconstitutional,
congress
had
a
choice.
and
the
choice
was
to
take
down
that
memorial,
which
meant
an
enormous
amount
to
veterans
in
the
community,
or
to
completely
dissociate
the
government
from
that
memorial.
and
what
congress
did
was
to
completely
dissociate
the
government
from
that
memorial
while
allowing
some
war
memorial
to
stand.
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
stevens,
with
respect,
the
reversionary
interest
says
that
the
holder,
the
vfw,
has
to
maintain
a
war
memorial.
it
does
not--
ms.
elena
kagan
--no,
the
reversionary
interest
simply
says:
a
war
memorial.
it
does
not
have
to
be
this
war
memorial.
ms.
elena
kagan
to
the
contrary,
justice
stevens.
when
congress
wanted
to
say
2002
act.
ms.
elena
kagan
in
the
2004
act,
it
said
something
very
different.
that
was
after
the
injunction
had
issued,
so
it
was
a
completely
different
set
of
circumstances.
congress
understood
that
an
injunction
against
this
war
memorial
had
issued.
congress
said:
we
are
going
to
give
this
back
to
the
vfw,
but
it's
going
to
be
the
vfw's
choice
now
as
to
what
to
do
with
it,
consistent
with
it
being
some
kind
of
war
memorial.
a
reversionary
interest
of
a
kind
that
congress
often
uses
to
--
when
it
transfers
land.
congress
--
it's
a
completely--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
think
it's
left
to
the
vfw,
and
it's
entirely
the
vfw's
choice.
so
if
tomorrow
or
ten
years
from
now
or
50
years
from
now
the
vfw
decides,
along
with
respondents,
that
a
cross
is
an
inappropriate
war
memorial,
then
they
can
take
down
that
war
memorial.
it's
no
longer
the
government's
message.
ms.
elena
kagan
but
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
prohibition
on
the
vfw
taking
down
this
memorial.
we
will
just
have
one
fewer
national
memorials.
and--
ms.
elena
kagan
--again,
i
think
it
is
entirely
up
to
the
vfw.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
don't
know,
because
i
am
not
the
vfw.
it
is
up
to
the
vfw
as
to
what
happens
to
this
war
memorial.
that's
also
true
of
the
plaque,
that
the
plaque
could
--
the
vfw
could
take
down
the
plaque
once
the
--
the
vfw
gains
title
to
this
property.
so
what
the
government
has
done
here
--
and
justice
stevens,
i
don't
want
to
--
of
course,
you
are
right
that
congress
started
out
thinking
they--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
stevens,
you
are,
of
course,
right
that
congress
thought
at
the
beginning,
prior
to
the
injunction,
that
this
war
memorial
should
not
be
taken
down,
that
there
was
an
attachment
to
it
in
the
local
community,
and
that
it
was
--
that
it
should
be
retained.
not
an
unnatural
thing
for
congress
to
want,
to
preserve
war
memorials.
when
the
injunction
issued
and
when
the
court
found
that
the
--
when
the
congress
found
that
the
courts
had
declared
this
display
of
this
memorial
unconstitutional,
congress
said:
how
can
we
preserve
this
--
preserve
a
war
memorial,
very
possibly
this
war
memorial?
how
can
we
preserve
a
war
memorial
but
have
it
not
be
our
choice?
