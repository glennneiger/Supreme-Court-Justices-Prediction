chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
08-472,
salazar
v.
buono.
general
kagan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
suppose
--
i
guess
i
don't
agree
with
your
dichotomy,
either
it's
the
same
action
or
it's
entirely
separate.
i
would
suppose
it
could
be
some
issues
carry
over
and
are
the
same,
and
perhaps
standing
is
one
of
those.
other
issues
are
completely
new,
such
as
the
effect
of
the
legislation,
which
couldn't
have
been
before
the
district
court
since
it
hadn't
been
passed.
but
standing
is
different.
i
mean,
once
it's
been
determined
that
there
is
standing
and
that
is
reflected
in
a
final
judgment,
then
i
think
the
later
aspects
are
simply
whether
the
person
--
once
it's
embodied
in
a
judgment,
i
think
that
is
the
basis
for
standing
and
not
the
earlier
questions
of
whether
he
visited
it
enough
or
planned
to
visit
enough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
we
get
--
before
your
time
expires,
we
would
like
to
spend
a
couple
of
minutes
on
the
merits.
[laughter]
and
i
wonder
if
you
could
focus
on
a
particular
question.
what
if
the
government
sold
simply
one
square
foot,
or
whatever
the
area
that
the
base
of
the
cross
is
--
is
resting
on
the
ground?
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
that
--
why
isn't
that
the
case
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
an
interference
or
it's
singling
out
someone,
private
property
owner,
who's
using
his
property
in
a
particular
way,
a
religious
way?
you
are
going
to
be
putting
up
signs
only
for
people
putting
up
religious
symbols.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
hasn't
done
anything
like
that.
it
doesn't
say
for
other
property
owners
that
have
maybe
something
that
--
you
know,
a
ramshackle
shack,
that
they
want
people
to
know
this
isn't
the
government's
property.
they
don't
do
anything
like
that.
it's
--
under
your
hypothetical,
it
would
be
only
religious
property
that
would
have
these
special
warning
signs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
the
question
of
--
i
don't
want
to
get
into
your
rebuttal
time,
but
briefly,
how
is
the
question
of
whether
signs
are
or
aren't
valid
or
required
before
us
in
this
case?
there
are
no
signs
there,
and
you
are
asking
us
to
consider
whether
the
statute
is
valid
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
eliasberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
under
your
approach
that
this
is
looking
to
see
if
the
injunction
is
being
enforced
or
violated,
we
would
be
reviewing
an
act
of
congress
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
not
--
not
de
novo?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
have
we
ever
done
that
before?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
have
we
ever
said
that
an
act
of
congress
is
unconstitutional
without
a
de
novo
review
of
the
merits
of
the
constitutionality?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
you
get
to
the
consistent
with
the
injunction
part
--
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
we
should
review
this
question
solely
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
while
the
court
did
not
decide
the
validity
of
the
act
in
the
first
case,
it
certainly
did
in
the
second
case,
which
is
why
we
have
the
case
before
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
--
if
--
if
the
government
sold
this
land
to
a
private
party,
no
cross
in
the
picture
at
all,
and
they
go
to
settlement
and
at
settlement
the
private
landowner
who
is
going
to
buy
it
says,
you
know,
i'm
going
to
put
a
big
cross
up
on
this
property
once
i
get
it,
can
the
government
still
sell
it
to
him?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
even
though
before
the
sale,
even
though
the
government
knows
there
is
going
to
be
a
big
cross
on
the
land
with
the
same
situation
you
have
here
in
the
middle
of
the
preserve
and
all,
that's
perfectly
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
before
the
government
sold
the
land
if
they
find
out
the
new
owner
is
going
to
put
a
cross
on
it
there
is
no
problem.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
disagree
with
what
she
told
us,
which
is
that
the
private
property
owner
can
tear
down
the
cross
at
any
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government.
does
that
--
do
you
just
mean
they
have
authority
to
regulate
the
land?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
they
have
jurisdiction
to
regulate
a
lot
of
--
lot
of
land
that
they
don't
own.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
else
--
what
else
does
the
plaque
say.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
it?
nothing
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
get
back
to
your
plaque
question?
am
i
wrong?
i
think
the
government
told
us
the
plaque
reads:
"the
cross
erected
in
memory
the
dead
of
all
wars,
erected
1934
by
members
of
veterans
of
foreign
wars,
death
valley
post
2884.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
big
difference.
i
mean,
the
whole
point
is
that
the
plaque
tells
you,
this
is
not
a
government
memorial,
government
structure.
it
was
put
up
by
members
of
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars,
death
valley
post
2884.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
context
of
my
question
was
what
does
the
plaque
say?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
this
probably
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
anything,
but
i'm
just
kind
of
curious,
why
is
this
cross
put
up
--
you
know,
in
the
middle
of
nowhere?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
general,
you
have
2
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
announcement
this
morning
in
case
08-472,
salazar
versus
buono.
