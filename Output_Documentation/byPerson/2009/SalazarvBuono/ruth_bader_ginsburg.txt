justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
kagan,
just
as
a
factual
matter,
is
there
any
other
national
memorial
that
consists
of
a
solitary
cross,
just
that
one
symbol
and
no
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
was
just
curious
as
a
factual
matter
whether
this
lone
cross,
if
--
if
there
was
any
other
memorial
like
that,
and
your
answer
is
no,
but
there
could
be
other
religiously
oriented
memorials?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
--
is
the
private
property
owner
who
has
this
designation
free
to
destroy
it
after
it's
been
designated
a
national
memorial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
they
then
substitute
whatever
other
memorial
they
chose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
would
there
have
to
be
some
government
approval?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wouldn't
automatically
require
acquire
a
national
memorial
status,
would
it,
when
the
government
hasn't
seen
it,
hasn't
--
i
thought
that
to
get
national
memorial
status,
the
government
has
to
approve
what
you
put
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
respondents
asked
to
have
the
injunction
enforced.
it
is
typical,
you
get
an
injunction
--
and
i'm
glad
that
the
government
has
recognized
that
that
was
indeed
a
final
decision
because
you
appealed
it
to
the
ninth
circuit
under
1291
as
a
final
decision.
then
the
question
is,
are
you
complying
with
the
injunction.
one
side
says,
the
winner
--
who
by
the
way
has
unquestioned
standing
to
enforce
the
injunction
that
is
now
final
that
that
party
obtained
--
the
winner
says:
court,
please
enforce
the
injunction.
they
are
not
asking
for
a
new
injunction.
they
say
this
injunction,
as
justice
breyer
just
explained,
says,
do
not
permit
the
cross.
the
party
comes
in
and
says:
here's
my
injunction;
court,
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
enforce
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know,
general
kagan,
any
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
permanent
injunction
ordered,
final,
no
more
appeals
are
possible,
where
--
and
standing
was
in
question,
raised,
litigated,
and
decided,
and
then
when
the
party
who
won
the
injunction
comes
to
the
court
and
says,
court,
please
enforce
the
injunction,
that
you
can
say,
now
we
can
go
back
to
square
one
and
argue
again
about
standing?
i
don't
see
how
you
can
revive
what
has
been
determined
by
a
final
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
know
it
isn't
that
because,
as
i
think
you
pointed
out,
the
same
docket
number.
this
wasn't
a
new
complaint.
this
was
a
motion
to
enforce
the
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
standing
issue
was
independently
important
to
the
government,
because
the
government
can
face
this
kind
of
question
again,
and
if
you
right
--
if
you
were
right
on
the
standing
point
--
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
why
the
government
would
not
have
had
a
strong
incentive
to
say,
we
want
to
get
rid
of
these
cases
on
the
standing
ground,
we
think
the
court
was
wrong
on
standing.
but
in
any
case,
you
didn't
do
that,
and
i
think
that
you
started
your
argument
this
morning
in
the
right
place
when
you
said,
let's
talk
about
this
law.
congress
said,
accepting
arguendo
that
the
court
was
right,
here's
a
law
that
cures
the
constitutional
defect.
and
that's
where
you
were
--
that's
where
you
started
your
argument.
maybe
you
can
pick
up
with
that.
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--who
would
see
it,
general
kagan?
who
would
see
it?
i
mean,
the
seventh
circuit
case,
it
was
--
it
was
on
level
ground,
lots
of
people
used
the
area,
and
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
required
a
fence
and
a
sign.
but
here,
this
cross
is
high
on
a
cliff
in
a
desolate
area.
and
if
you
had
a
little
sign,
who
would
be
--
you
would
have
to
climb
up
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
eliasberg,
i
thought
that
the
ninth
circuit
the
first
time
around
had
taken
meticulous
care
to
make
certain
that
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
would
not
be
before
the
court
in
the
first
round.
judge
kozinski
wrote:
"we
express
no
view
as
to
whether
a
transfer
completed
under
section
8121
would
pass
constitutional
muster,
but
leave
this
question
for
another
day.
"
that's
on
page
104a
of
the
petition.
and
then
the
district
judge
said:
yes,
i
recognize
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
touch
the
validity
of
that
statute,
left
it
for
another
day.
the
day
has
come.
so
it
is
for
the
first
time
that
the
court
is
deciding
the
question
of
whether
section
8121
passes
constitutional
muster.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
--
i
think
general
kagan
agreed
that
they
--
the
veterans
couldn't
substitute
some
other
memorial,
if
it's
going
to
be
a
national
monument
it
has
to
have
the
government's
approval.
and
the
only
one
that
has
the
government's
approval
is
the
cross.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
government's
argument
that
suppose
the
government
took
down
the
cross,
gave
it
back
to
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars,
sold
them
the
land
in
exchange
for
land
of
equal
value,
and
then
the
veterans
said,
fine,
the
cross
was
ours
to
begin
with.
now
the
land
is
ours,
so
we
just
put
it
back.
if
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
injunction?
the
government
now
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
cross.
it's
all
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars,
and
it
can't
be
regarded
a
sham
because
it
was
originally
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars
who
put
it
up,
the
government
didn't
put
it
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
we
are
talking
about
something
that
is
rather
formal
rather
than
substantial.
if
--
if
all
the
government
would
have
to
do
is
say,
congress,
you
didn't
get
it
right.
you
should
have
just
made
the
land
swap.
and
then
the
government
would
take
down
the
cross
in
compliance
with
the
injunction,
and
then
it
goes
right
back
the
next
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
general
kagan
recognized
that
there
isn't
an
example
of
a
final
injunction,
where,
after
it's
final
as
it
can
be,
you
can
come
back
and
say,
but,
now,
i
want
to
reargue
the
standing
question
that's
already
been
determined.
but
there
was
something
that
i
did
want
to
ask
you
about,
judge
o'scanlon's
opinion.
he
said,
if
--
if
you
prevail
and
you
are
right,
what
happens
in
arlington
cemetery,
where
there's
the
argonne
cross
memorial
and
the
canadian
cross
of
sacrifice,
both
right
here
in
arlington,
what
happens
to
them?
