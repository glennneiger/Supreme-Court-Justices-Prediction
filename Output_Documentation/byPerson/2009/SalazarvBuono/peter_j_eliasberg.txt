mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
i
would
like
to
direct
my
beginning
remarks
to
you.
i
believe
you've
correctly
stated
the
procedural
posture
exactly
right.
the
only
question,
point
that
i
would
make,
is
that
i
don't
believe
we
did
--
there
was
a
modification
of
the
injunction
here.
any
time
a
defendant
passes
a
piece
of
legislation
after
an
injunction
is
first
entered,
there
may
be
a
question
as
to
whether
that
new
statute
or
legislation
is
consistent
with
the
injunction.
but
it's
not
new
relief.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
i
believe
that's
--
that
is
here
and
that
is
really
the
only
question
that
is
here.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
that's
correct.
but
for
this--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--i--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--i
am
not
aware
of
that,
but
i
am
also
not
aware
of
a
situation
where
the
act
of
congress
is
being
put
forth
as
the
response
to
an
already
adjudicated
constitutional
violation.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
the
only
thing
i
would
disagree
with
you
on
that
point,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
question
is
whether
the
act
of
congress
remedies
the
already
adjudicated
constitutional
violation
and
is
consistent
with
the
injunction.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
it
is
our
position--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--that
is
correct.
we
believe
--
but
may
i
make
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice?
first,
we
believe
in
the
enforcement
context
where
the
question
is,
is
this
a
violation
of
an
already
entered
injunction
that
was
part
of
a
final
judgment,
that
that
is
traditional
equity
principles
that
you
review
for
an
abuse
of
discretion.
nonetheless,
we
believe
that
we
win
even
under
a
de
novo
standard.
so
--
and
if
i
could
set
forth
some
of
the
reasons
for
that.
i
think,
justice
breyer,
that
you
have
it
exactly
correct,
that
what
the
government
has
done
here
by
selecting
a
particular
transferee
who
has
been
given
preferential
access
to
the
land
in
the
past
to
the
exclusion
of
others
who
wanted
to
erect
other
symbols,
that
the
government
is
taking
affirmative
steps
to
permit,
through
this
transfer
statute,
the
display
of
the
cross
that
they
are
enjoined
from
doing.
now,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
your
point
is
at
some
point
if
this
is
on
private
land
and
the
government
is
not
making
any
efforts
to
further
this
display,
that
it
couldn't
possibly
be
that
the
injunction
forbids
that.
and
that
may
well
be
correct,
but
that
is
not
the
case
we
have
in
front
of
it.
the
government
in
this
transfer
statute
has
made
a
significant
number
of
affirmative
steps
to
ensure
that
the
cross
remains
up.
it
has
selected--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--when
the
district
court
entered
the
injunction,
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
scalia
--
excuse
me
--
justice
alito,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
one
of
the
bases
for
the
entry
of
the
injunction
in
the
first
instance
was
the
way
that
the
government
had
favored
one
party
to
come
on,
contrary
to
the
government's
own
regulations,
and
erect
a
permanent
symbol,
while
not
allowing
others.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
we
did
not
make
that
argument
because
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
well,
i
think
that,
as
is
traditional
equity
principles,
the
district
court
is
at
some
level
the
master
of
its
injunction
and
that's
why
we
give
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
the
district
court
very
clearly
said:
i
see
this
as
an
attempt
by
the
government
not
to
abide
by
my
injunction;
they
are
favoring
the
same
parties
they
favored
when
--
that
was
part
of
the--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--well,
i
think
it
is--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--well,
but
it's
not
the
erection
of
the
cross.
it
is
the
transfer
of
something
where
the
government
has
a
reversionary
interest.
it
very
much
directs
the
way
the
vfw
is
likely
to
use
the
land.
it
selected
a
particular
transferee
who
has
been
favored
from
the
beginning.
they
didn't
say:
we're
going
to
neutrally
sell
the
land
in
order
to
allow
this
constitutional
violation
to
be--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--well,
i
believe
it's
invalid
because
i
think
that
the
affirmative
steps
they
are
taking
here
really
make
them
--
put
them
in
a
position
where
they
are
permitting--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--no,
they
would
not.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
that
is
one
part
of
my
argument.
but
there
is
another
part.
the
government
has
taken
the
step
of
designating
this
cross
one
of
49
national
memorials
in
the
whole
country
and
the
only
national
memorial
commemorating
american
service
in
world
war
i,
even
though
it's
clear
in
the
record--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--we
are
alleging
that
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
which
includes
the
national
memorial
designation,
the
government's
asserted
purpose
to
make
sure
that
the
cross
remains
up,
the
government's
favoritism
of
the
same
parties
that
it
has
always
favored
in
this
case
to
the
exclusion
of
others,
and
the
maintaining
of
the
property
interest
in
the
land
in
the
form
of
a
reversionary
interest,
all
of
those
things--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--i'm
sorry,
does
what
apply
to
all
lands?
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
no,
the
reversionary
interest
specifically
says
the
land
reverts
to
the
government
if--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--i
don't
believe
that
that
is
true.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
if
the
basis
for
the
government's
decision
to
sell
the
--
sell
the
land
was
a
neutral
basis.
and
that's
what
we
are
saying
here.
if
what
the
government
has
done--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--no,
it's--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--the
difference
between
those
two
scenarios,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
one
is
a
remedial
context.
the
government
has
been
held
to
violate
the
constitution.
they
have
to,
under
milliken
v.
bradley
and
u.s.
v.
virginia,
take
all
steps
necessary
to
erase
that
constitutional
violation.
the
situation
in
the
first
hypothetical
you
gave
me,
there
has
never
been
an
adjudicated
constitutional
violation.
it's
a
very
different
situation.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
i
think
that
is--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--as
i
was
stating
to
justice
sotomayor,
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
we
believe
separates
this
situation
from
the
kind
of
hypotheticals
that
you're
setting
forth.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
i
think
that
there
are
very
significant
obstacles
to
their
doing
that.
one,
i
don't
--
i
disagree
with
the
general's
--
general
kagan's
description
of
the
criminal
statute
that
prohibits
the
defacement
of
memorials
on
private
land,
because
one
of
the
provisions
is
that
we
will
consider
it
a
situation
that
is
covered
by
the
statute
that
the
land
be
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government.
well,
the
land
--
the
statute
that
designated
the
mojave
preserve
very
clearly
says
that
the
land
is
being
transferred
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
to
the
national
park
service
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
so
it
is
therefore
clearly
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government.
so
i
think
that
there
is
--
there
are
possible
criminal
violations.
there
is
also
a
significant
question--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--that's
correct.
but
that's
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
under
federal
jurisdiction,
so
i
believe
that
those
two
terms--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--well
i
think
that
in
this
case
when
the
government
is
actually
--
there's
quite
a
bit
of
case
law
--
we
set
forth
some
in
our
brief
--
where
they
talk
about
the
government's
power
over
land
that's
within
a
national
preserve,
so
i
do
think
that
the
criminal
statutes
may
very
well
apply.
it
certainly
would
be
a
barrier
to
the
vfw's
thinking,
well,
no
risk
to
us
if
we
tear
this
cross
down.
in
addition,
the
government
is
required,
as
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
and
i
don't
remember
which
--
the
government
has
been
required
to
go
back
and
put
up
a
plaque
that
says:
this
cross
erected
in
honor
of
the
foreign
war
dead.
it
would
be
very
odd
indeed,
i
believe
for
the
vfw--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--the
plaque
says:
"this
cross"
--
in
big
letters
--
"erected
in
honor
of
the
dead
of
foreign
wars.
"
i
think
it
would
be
very--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--nothing
else.
i
think
it
would
be
very
odd
indeed
for
the
vfw
to
feel
that
it
was
free
to
take
down
the
cross
and
put
up,
for
example,
a
statues
of
a
soldier
which
would
honor
all
of
the
people
who
fought
for
america
in
world
war
i,
not
just
christians,
and
say:
well,
we
were
free
to
do
that
because
even
though
there's
the
sign
that
says,
this
cross
is
designated
to
honor
all
the--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--i
believe
that's
actually
correct.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
it
doesn't
say
that,
but
a
cross
is
the
predominant
symbol
of
christianity
and
it
signifies
that
jesus
is
the
son
of
god
and
died
to
redeem
mankind
for
our
sins,
and
i
believe
that's
why
the
jewish
war
veterans--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--well,
justice
scalia,
if
i
may
go
to
your
first
point.
the
cross
is
the
most
common
symbol
of
the
resting
place
of
christians.
i
have
been
in
jewish
cemeteries.
there
is
never
a
cross
on
a
tombstone
of
a
jew.
[laughter]
so
it
is
the
most
common
symbol
to
honor
christians.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
well,
my
--
the
point
of
my
--
point
here
is
to
say
that
there
is
a
reason
the
jewish
war
veterans
came
in
and
said
we
don't
feel
honored
by
this
cross.
this
cross
can't
honor
us
because
it
is
a
religious
symbol
of
another
religion.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
apologize.
i
forgot--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
context
of
your
question
was
would
vfw
feel
constrained
to
keep
the
cross
up?
and
my
point
was--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--well
--
i
--
i
apologize
for
not
giving
the
full
text,
that
was
not
my
intention
to
--
to
mislead
the
court
or
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
my
only
point
is
that
in
that
scenario,
because
did
i
believe
we
were
talking
about,
is
the
vfw
free
to
do
this,
and
i
was
pointing
to
the
criminal
statute
that
i
said
i
believe
said
that
they
couldn't
--
wouldn't
feel
free
to
take
this
down.
but
second
of
all,
that
it
would
be
odd
indeed
for
them
to
take
it
down
when
there
is
a
big
plaque
that
says
this
cross
erected.
with
all
of
the--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
real
--
well,
but
--
but
i
don't
think
that
the
cases
turn
on
whether
a
prosecutor
says
well,
i
promise
you
that
we
are
not
going
to
enforce
the
statute.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute
and
the
words
of
the
reversionary
interest,
and
i
think
they
both
create
significant
doubt
as
to
whether
the
vfw
would
feel
free
to
turn
this
--
to
take
it
down,
in
the
same
way
that
in
a
context
where
you
are
talking
about
pre-enforcement--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--well,
that
--
the
--
the
question
of
government
--
continued
government
involvement
with
the
land,
i
believe,
continues,
because
of
the
reversionary
interest
and
because
of
the
designation
as
a
national
memorial.
whatever
the--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
general
kagan
but
with
respect
to
the
question--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--that
is
the
government's
position.
but
justice
ginsburg,
your
question
is
would
something
else
they
put
up
be
a
national
memorial,
and
the
answer
is
no.
only
congress
has
the
power
to
designate
a
national
memorial.
congress
has
chosen
to
designate
this
particular
stand-alone
latin
cross
as
a
government
--
as
a
national
memorial.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
i
believe
that
that
--
obviously
not
the
facts
presented
by
our
case,
justice
ginsburg,
but
that
likely
would
be
consistent
with
the
injunction,
that's
correct.
but
it
is
not
the
scenario
we
have
here.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
well,
i
think
if
there
--
if
there
were
--
i
think
it's
not
just
formalism,
your
honor,
because
one,
the
reversionary
--
i
am
assuming
that
in
your
hypothetical
the
reversionary
interest
is
gone.
that
is
continuing
government
ownership,
future
ownership
in
property,
and
one
of
the
government's
principal
arguments
is
when
we
sell
to
it
a
private
owner
everyone
presumes
that
the
private
owner
is
the
speaker.
but
when
the
government
maintains
a
substantial
future
property
interest,
they
haven't
sold
the
land.
they've
sold
part
of
their
interest
in
the
land.
so
if
you
take
away
the
reversionary
interest
and
you
remove
the
national
memorial
designation
and
then
the
vfw
independently
does
choose
to
put
up
the
cross,
it's
more
than
formalism.
it
is
the--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--i
believe
that
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
that's
an
important
point
that
is
intertwined
with
the
fact
that
the
reversionary
interest
also
continues
the
government's
ownership
in
the
land,
when
their
whole
position
is,
if
we
privatize
it,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
if
it's
just
a
private
owner,
then
we
don't
associate
this
cross
with
the
government.
we
associate
it
with
the
private
owner.
but
the
government
hasn't
done
that.
it
has
maintained
an
important
ownership
interest
in
the
land
through
that
reversionary
interest.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--context
has
always
mattered
to
this
court
in
establishment
clause
cases.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
well,
i
do
think
that
washington
is,
certainly,
a
seat
of
power,
and
there
is,
obviously,
a
close
tie
between
something
that
is
put
on
the
national
mall
in
the
seat
of
government,
but
i
do
think
that
the
designation
of
a
national
memorial
is
also
significant.
so,
even
though
this
may
be
an
area
that
is
not
nearly
as
populated
as
washington,
d.c.,
it
is
very
significant
that
congress
has
taken
the
step
with
this
particular
symbol,
one
of
only
49
in
the
country,
grouping
it
with
other
iconic
statues
and
memorials
in
this
country
and
tied
it.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
distinction,
although
it
might
have
some
bearing
in
the
court,
in
thinking
of
the
context,
i
don't
think
it
would
change
the
result.
justice
kennedy,
i
want
to
go
back
to
--
to
one
question
you
had
asked
earlier
about
the
posture,
and
i
just
want
to
reiterate.
you,
very
clearly,
said,
when
the
government
was
saying,
well,
we
didn't
have
a
good
reason
to
bring
this
to
the
court,
and
that's
why
we
didn't,
i
think
your
question
recognized
that
the
government
had
very
good
reasons.
but
--
but
in
addition,
it's
not
really
important,
when
you
have
a
final
judgment,
why
a
party
chooses
not
to
try
to
take
the
last
step
of
appeal
on
a
final
judgment,
and
that's
the
united
states
v.
munsingwear
case.
the
government
chose
not
to
make
that
step.
the
judgment
was
final,
and
there,
certainly,
is
no
basis
for
this
court
to
reopen
the
issues
about
whether
mr.
buono
had
standing
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
well,
two
points,
if
i
may,
justice
alito.
first,
the
first
reason
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave
for
why
the
case
wasn't
moot
was
not
voluntary
cessation.
the
government
conceded
the
land
transfer
could
take
up
to
two
years
to
effectuate,
so
in
the
ninth
circuit,
that
this
case
is
far
from
moot.
two
years
is
more
than
enough
time
to
file
the
government
to
file
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
had
a
ruling,
both
on
the
merits
of
the
land
on
--
the
cross
on
government
property,
but
more
important,
as
a
number
of
justices
had
pointed
out,
the
question
of
standing
to
bring
an
establishment
clause
case,
the
government
always
have
an
interest
in
saying,
this
case
should
never
have
been
brought.
we
never
should
had
have
had
a
judgment
entered
against
us.
for
the
government
to
say,
we
didn't
really
care
at
that
point
because,
two
years
from
now,
the
transfer
might
be
effectuated
is
not
basis
for
them
to
argue
that
there
was
no
final
judgment
and
no
reason
for
us
to
appeal.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
going
back,
justice
ginsburg,
to
the
merits
on
the
earlier
question
about
a
cross
on
government
property,
i
believe
that
the
argonne
cross
in
the
national
--
in
memorial
cemetery
is
extremely
different.
there
are,
in
the
national
cemeteries,
the
--
the
va
offers,
to
veterans
and
their
family,
a
choice
of
putting
up
39
different
emblems
and
beliefs
on
their
tombstones.
in
arlington,
there
is
a
cross
that
is
surrounded
by
a
sea
of
tombstones
with
symbols
of
the
faith
of
all
of
the
different
service
members.
in
that
context,
i
don't
think
anyone
would
perceive
that
the
government
was
favoring
one
particular
religion
because
of
the
variety
of
choices
and
religious
symbols
expressed
there.
that's
very
different
from
a
stand-alone
cross
of
one
religious
symbol
that
is
not
surrounded
by
any
other
context,
other
than--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--they
did.
there
was
a
request
made
for
--
to
put
up
a
memorial
on
the
site,
and
the
government
said
no
and
said,
our
regulations
forbid
it.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
yes.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
i
think
the
context
here
is
what
has
the
government
done
with
respect
to
national
memorials.
the
only
two
national
memorials
that
are
stand-alone
religious
symbols
are
of
one
particular
religious
denomination,
and
that's
christianity.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
well,
it's
congress
--
i
don't
know
that
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars
ever
proposed
that
this
be
a
national
memorial.
congress
designated
it
as
one.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
as
i
said
before--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--i'm
not
saying
that
in
--
in
--
that,
in
every
circumstance,
the
government
has
to
have
lots
of
different
symbols,
but
what
the
government
has
done
here--
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
--well,
justice
scalia,
if
i
make
one
prefatory
point,
the
government
didn't
bring
to
this
court
the
merits
of
the
question
of
whether
the
cross
was
permissible
on
government
property.
there
is
a
final
judgment
set
in
this
circumstance.
in
this
context,
it
is
not.
so
that
question
is
not
properly
before
us,
but
context
matters,
and
i
do
think,
in
other
circumstances,
there
may
be
religious
symbols.
there
may
be
a
myriad
of
religious
symbols
and
the
context
of
the
situation
will
matter.
but
i
think
if,
in
arlington,
for
example
--
with
respect
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
if,
for
example,
a
foreign
government
--
let's
take
the
canadian
cross
of
sacrifice,
which
the
government
has
put
in
its
brief,
was
donated
by
a
foreign
government
to
honor
people
--
americans
who
fought
for
canada
and
the
british
empire,
in
i
believe
it
was
world
war
i,
if
the
state
of
israel
made
a
similar
request
to
the
united
states,
we
would
like
to
honor
the
jews
who
fought
in
operation
iraqi
freedom
because
we
believe
that
that
was
an
important
defense
of
the
state
of
israel,
and
the
united
states
said,
no,
we
are
not
interested,
i
think
that
that
would
create
a
quite
significant
constitutional
violation
--
or
constitutional
question,
but
it's
not
the
case
in
front
of
us.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
the
one
national
memorial
that
i
am
aware
of
that
has
a
cross,
it
is
of
father
marquette,
who
was
a
significant
historical
figure.
it
is
not
a
stand-alone
cross.
it
is
father
marquette
surrounded
by
a
number
of
various
objects
that
show
his
role
as
a
historical
figure,
exploring
the
middle
west,
and
he
is
holding
a
cross.
but,
again,
i
think
--
i
agree
with
general
kagan
that,
if
we
honored
martin
luther
king,
who
was
a
priest,
or
we
honored
--
we
did
something
with
the
old
north
church
which
had
significant
historical
significance,
that
would
create
a
very
different
issue
than
simply
a
stand-alone
cross,
where,
when
the
national
park
service
asked
its
own
historian
to
determine
whether
it
had
historical
value
necessary
to
bring
it
within
the
national
register
of
historic
places,
the
park
service's
own
historian
said,
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
peter
j.
eliasberg
because
the
man
who
originally
put
up
the
cross
--
not
this
one,
because
it
has
been
replaced
a
number
of
times,
but
the
man
who
put
up
this
particular
cross,
i
believe
was
a
homesteader
in
the
area
when
the
land
was
owned
by
the
bureau
of
land
management,
and
i
believe
was
a
miner
on
the
land.
i
hope
that
is
correct
historically.
i
believe
it
is.
