alito,

what
are
the
practical
consequences
of
something
being
designated
as
a
national
memorial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
this
injunction
was
first
entered
the
statute
--
nobody
contemplated
that
this
statute
was
going
to
be
enacted;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
so
isn't
the
sensible
interpretation
of
the
injunction
that
it
was
prohibiting
the
government
from
permitting
the
display
of
the
cross
on
government
property,
and
not
on
private
property
that
happens
to
be
within
the
mojave
national
preserve?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wasn't
your
argument
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
because
it
was
on
government
land?
did
you
make
the
argument
that
even
if
this
was
on
one
of
the
ranches
within
the
mojave
national
preserve,
it
would
still
be
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
it
was
a
totally
--
so
the
situation
completely
changed
and
the
district
court
either
modified
the
injunction
--
it
seems
to
me
modified
the
injunction
by
interpreting
it
to
mean
something
quite
different
from
what
anybody
contemplated
it
meant
when
it
was
originally
entered?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
the
solicitor
general
represents
to
us
that
the
vfw
will
be
perfectly
free
to
modify
this
memorial
in
any
way
it
chooses
if
they
obtain
title
to
this
land,
do
you
think
that
there's
any
realistic
fear
that
they
will
be
required
to
maintain
this
cross,
even
if
they
wish
to
--
to
change
it
in
some
way?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
although
there
was
going
to
be
a
formal
transfer
of
title,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
government
was
still
involved
with
the
maintenance
of
the
cross
on
this
land.
and
when
the
government
says
that
that's
not
the
case,
i
don't
know
why
that
doesn't
cure
the
practical
problem.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
it
had
to
be
maintained
as
a
national
war
--
as
a
war
memorial,
but
not
that
it
had
to
be
maintained
as
a
cross.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
wasn't
--
isn't
this
very
different
from
the
situation
in
toledo
steel
because
--
scale,
i'm
sorry
--
because,
if
the
merits
issue
that
was
before
the
ninth
circuit
was,
if
not
technically
moot,
nearly
moot,
by
the
time
they
reached
it,
because
of
the
passage
of
the
new
statute.
this
wasn't
--
they
said
it's
not
moot
because
this
is
simply
the
voluntary
cessation
of
conduct
that's
been
held
to
be
unlawful,
but
that
is
typically
applied
in
the
situation
where
there
is
a
legitimate
fear
that
the
--
the
party
that
has
been
held
to
be
violating
the
constitution
may
simply
return
to
its
bad
old
ways,
once
the
litigation
is
over.
but,
here,
you
have
the
intervening
enactment
of
a
statute
by
the
constitution
--
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
and
i
think
it
would
be
quite
far-fetched
to
presume
that
congress
is
simply
going
to
repeal
the
statute
and
go
back
to
the
way
things
were,
once
the
litigation
is
over.
so
you
have
a
merits
issue
that's
not
--
if
technically
moot,
nearly
moot.
the
real
merits
issue
in
the
case
is
--
is
expressly
not
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit.
they
say,
take
that
back
to
the
district
court.
and
you
say
that
the
standing
issue
goes
away
because
the
government
didn't
appeal
the
standing
issue
at
a
time
when
the
real
merits
issue
in
the
case
had
not
been
decided.
