in

of

mounted
a
latin
cross
on
the
rock
as
a
memorial
to
soldiers
who
died
in

i.
the
cross
has
been
replaced
or
repaired
at
various
times
over
the
years
by
private
parties
and
across
now
consists
of
4
inch

metal

that
are

cannot
be

from

nearest

but
it
is
visible
from
a
nearby
access
road.

has

asked
to
consider

challenge

to
the
first
placement
of

on

to
a
federal
statute,
a
congressional
enactment
that
would
transfer
the
land
on
which
the
cross
stands
to
a
private
party.
the
district
court
enjoined
the
government
from
implementing
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
we
now
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
almost
7
decades
after
the
cross
was
first
constructed,
a
challenge
to
its
presence
was
bought
by
frank
buono.
he
is
the
respondent
here.
he
has
claimed
that
the
cross’s
presence
on
federal
land
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
he
sought
an
injunction
requiring
the
government
to
remove
the
cross.
the
procedural
background
involved
is
lengthy,
involved
two
district
court
decisions
and
two
court
of
appeals
decisions
before
the
case
came
here.
in
the
first
round
of
litigation,
the
district
court
found
that
the
presence
of
the
cross
was
unconstitutional
because
it
conveyed
an
impression
of
governmental
endorsement
of
religion.
in
2002,
the
court
granted
an
injunction
of
forbidding
the
government
from
maintaining
the
cross
and
its
location
and
preserve,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
and
it
affirmed
it
both
on
the
issue
of
respondents
standing
to
bring
the
suit
and
on
the
merits
of
its
constitutional
challenge.
the
government
did
not
seek
review
of
the
decision
of
court
of
appeals,
so
that
decision
became
final.
while
the
government's
appeal
was
pending
congress
passed
a
statute
and
the
statute
directed
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
transfer
the
cross
in
the
land
on
which
it
stands
to
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars,
vfw,
in
exchange
for
privately
owned
land
elsewhere
in
the
preserve
and
this
is
the
so-called
land
transfer
statute
and
it
presents
the
primary
issue
to
be
decided
here.
in
the
second
round,
respondent
then
returned
to
the
district
court,
and
that
second
round
of
litigation
began.
this
time
the
respondent
sought
injunctive
relief
against
the
land
transfer
and
land
transfer
statute.
the
district
court
granted
his
request;
it
concluded
that
the
land
transfer
statute
was
an
attempt
to
evade
the
earlier
injunction,
the
2002
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
again
affirmed,
we
granted
the
government's
petition
for
review.
since
this
court
did
not
renew
the
first
court
of
appeals
decisions,
we
do
not
rule
on
respondents
standing
to
bring
the
first
suit.
now,
that’s
a
final
judgment.
we
now
must
decide
whether
respondent
has
standing
to
seek
release
in
the
second
phase
of
litigation.
we
conclude
that
respondent
does
have
standing
in
the
second
suit.
he
established
his
entitlement
to
the
2002
injunction
in
the
first
stages
of
the
litigation,
that
ruling
became
final
and
he
then
sought
to
prevent
the
government
from
frustrating
or
avoiding
or
evading
the
2002
injunction.
his
interest
in
doing
so
was
sufficiently
personal
and
concrete
to
support
his
standing.
the
next
question
is
whether
the
district
court
was
correct
to
issue
an
injunction
against
the
land
transfer
statute.
the
district
court
granted
this
relief
on
the
premise
that
it
was
necessary
to
protect
the
respondent’s
rights
under
the
2002
injunction
but
the
district
court
committed
reversible
errors
in
our
view
in
reaching
this
conclusion.
first
the
district
court
did
not
consider
the
substantial
change
in
circumstances
brought
about
by
the
land
transfer
statute.
the
district
court
dismissed
congress’s
motives
in
passing
the
statute
as
illicit.
as
a
result,
it
took
insufficient
account
of
the
context
in
which
the
statute
was
enacted
and
the
reasons
for
its
passage.
private
parties
placed
across
on
federal
land.
they
do
not
do
so,
as
an
attempt
to
place
the
government's
approval
behind
a
particular
creed.
their
intent
was
to
honor
fallen
soldiers.
the
cross
stood
for
nearly
7
decades
before
the
statute
was
enacted
by
which
time
the
cross
and
the
cause
it
commemorated
had
become
entwined
in
the
public's
consciousness.
the
2002
injunction
thus
presented
the
government
with
the
dilemma,
it
could
not
maintain
the
cross
without
violating
the
injunction
but
it
could
not
remove
the
cross
without
conveying
disrespect
for
those
the
cross
was
seem
as
honoring.
dealing
neither
alternative
satisfactory,
congress
enacted
the
land
transfer
statute.
the
statute
embodied
the
legislative
judgment
that
this
dispute
is
best
resolved
through
a
framework
and
policy
of
accommodation.
the
statute
should
not
have
been
dismissed
as
an
invasion
for
bought
about
a
change
of
law
in
a
congressional
statement
of
policy
applicable
to
this
case.
the
district
court
also
erred
by
focusing
on
the
religious
aspects
of
the
cross,
divorced
from
its
background
and
context.
the
goal
of
avoiding
governmental
endorsement
does
not
require
eradication
of
all
religious
symbols
in
the
public
realm.
across
by
the
side
of
a
public
highway
marking
for
instance,
the
place
where
a
state
trooper
perished
need
not
be
taken
as
a
statement
of
governmental
support
for
sectarian
beliefs.
the
cross
is
a
religious
symbol
but
it
is
also
a
symbol
often
used
to
honor
and
respect
those
who
have
major
work
and
noble
contributions
on
behalf
of
this
nation
and
its
people.
this
cross
is
like
so
many
others
that
mark
the
graves
of
americans
who
fell
in
battles,
battles
whose
tragedies
are
compounded
if
the
fallen
are
forgotten.
the
district
court
did
not
consider
and
so
gave
insufficient
weight
to
these
aspects
of
the
cross.
finally
the
district
court
erred
by
striking
down
the
land
transfer
statute
without
considering
whether
other
less
severe
alternatives
existed.
our
respect
for
a
coordinate
branch
of
government
for
business
to
interfere
with
an
act
of
congress
except
upon
a
clear
showing
that
relief
is
necessary.
it
is
congress’s
judgment
that
the
land
transfer
is
a
proper
accommodation
of
competing
interests
but
even
if
the
district
court
decided
otherwise,
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
consider
alternative
forms
of
relief
that
did
not
involve
invalidating
the
statute.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
the
chief
justice
joins

opinion
in
full
