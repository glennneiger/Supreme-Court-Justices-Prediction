justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
understand
--
i
don't
understand
that
point
at
all.
if
you
thought
that
he
didn't
have
standing
to
challenge
the
cross
at
all
and
that
the
injunction
itself
directing
you
to
cover
up
the
cross
was
wrong,
you
should
have
come
to
the
court.
it
was
a
permanent
injunction.
you
were
told
you
have
interlocutory
appeal
rights,
you
have
final
judgment
rights.
at
any
point
you
could
have
come
and
said:
the
order
for
us
to
take
that
flag
--
to
take
that
cross
off
this
land
was
just
plain
wrong.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
interlocutory
appeal
or
finality
doesn't
matter
what
you
are
going
to
do
to
get
away
from
the
injunction.
the
issue
is
did
you
give
up
any
rights
to
challenge
any
of
the
issues
embodied
in
that
injunction
and
you
haven't
answered
why
not.
you
may
have
a
right,
and
you
do,
to
challenge
a
modification
of
that
injunction.
that's
what
you
are
here
to
do,
to
say
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
modifying
the
injunction
and
stopping
the
transfer.
perfectly
legitimate
point,
because
the
injunction
has
been
changed.
but
you
can't
go
back
and
relitigate
whether
he
had
standing
to
challenge
that
--
the
presence
of
that
cross.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
there
legislation
that
requires
the
original
plaque
to
be
reinstated,
the
plaque
recognizing
the
donation
and
what
it
means?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
would
be
on
government
land,
that
sign?
it
wouldn't
be
on
the
acre
that
you
transferred.
i'm
a
little
confused.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
talking
about
putting--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--would
go
on
the
cross?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
larger
sign
you're
talking
about
that
you
are
willing
to
do
is
a
sign
that
you
would
put
on
government
land.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
you
raise
that
alternative
with
the
ninth
--
with
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
--
can
--
what,
what
--
let's
start
from
the
beginning.
can
--
would
it
be
proper
for
the
government
or
would
the
government
be
alleged
to
have
violated
the
establishment
clause
if
on
another
ranch
that
cross
--
a
cross
went
up?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
really
your
argument
is
that
the
reason
this
court
--
this
cross
on
private
land,
if
it
becomes
private,
is
offensive
to
the
establishment
clause
is
because
of
the
government's
prior
history
with
respect
to
that
cross,
correct?
that's
--
that's
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
you
alleging
that
doing
that
violates
the
establishment
clause,
passing
or
designating
a
religious
symbol
as
a
national
memorial,
that
that
violates
the
establishment
clause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
apply
to
all
lands
in
this
preserve?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
the
reversionary
interest
apply
to
all
of
lands
on
this
preserve?
maybe
your
adversary
has
to
answer
that
instead
of
you,
but
all
of
the
other
private
property
owners.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
are
all
of
the
private
owners
on
this
preserve
required
to
give
the
land
back
to
the
u.s.
if
they
put
it
to
some
different
use?
