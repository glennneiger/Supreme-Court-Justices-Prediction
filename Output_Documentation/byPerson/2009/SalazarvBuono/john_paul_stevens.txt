justice
john
paul
stevens
what
percentage
of
the
total
area
do
they
represent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
concede
there
was
a
violation
at
the
time
the
case
was
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
concede
that
the
establishment
clause
was
violated
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
also
a
very
different
case
if
a
condition
of
the
transfer
is
that
the
transferee
will
preserve
a
memorial
that
has
been
designated
in
the
statute
as
a
five-foot-tall
white
cross.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
a
condition
of
the
transfer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
also
the
point
that
i
don't
think
you
stressed,
that
if
the
reversionary
interest
was
activated
--
say
they
abandoned
or
destroyed
it,
the
property
would
come
back
to
the
government.
and
if
i
read
the
--
the
designation
of
the
national
memorial
statute
correctly,
the
department
of
interior
would
have
to
rebuild
the
old
cross
and
put
it
up.
there's
an
affirmative
duty
to
replace
the
cross
if
there
is
a
reversion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question:
do
you
think
the
issues
in
this
case
would
be
--
stay
the
same
or
different,
if
this
whole
scenario
occurred
on
the
mall
in
--
right
out
in
front
of
the
washington
--
the
lincoln
memorial?
would
the
--
the
issues
be
any
different
if
it
were
not
an
isolated
memorial
in
the
desert?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
which
way
would
it
cut,
if
it
is
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
different
question,
just
based
on
your
understanding
of
all
these
monuments?
are
there
any
other
federal
monuments
that
contained
crosses,
other
than
those
associated
with
the
cemeteries?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
say
that
when
there's
a
reversionary
interest?
how
can
you
say
it's
completely
dissociated?
there
is
a
reversionary
interest
if
they
don't
maintain
the
cross,
which
is
the
monument,
it
goes
back
to
the
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
particular
memorial
described
by
congress
was
this
cross.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
then
it
doesn't
--
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
interpret
congress's
interest
to
being
and
preserving
this
memorial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
anyone
thought
there
is
the
remotest
possibility
they
would
put
up
a
different
memorial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
they
say
it's
an
inappropriate
war
memorial
when
congress
has
designated
the
national
memorial
as,
quote,
"the
five-foot-tall
white
cross"
and
so
forth
and
so
on?
that
is
what
is
the
memorial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
really
think
there
is
any
possibility
that
would
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
not
only
started
it
out,
but
they
authorized
the
use
of
$10,000
in
money
in
order
to
replace
the
very
cross
they
had
designated
as
a
memorial.
