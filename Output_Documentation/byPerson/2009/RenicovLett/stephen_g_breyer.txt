justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
mistrials
every
year
and
hung
juries
are
not
all
that
unusual.
so
in
this
case
we
have
testimony
going
on
for
4
days,
10
hours
total.
and
we
have
jury
deliberation
of
4-1/2
hours,
and
we
have
really
very
little
--
i
think
you
can
argue
it
both
ways
that
the
jury
was
deadlocked.
there
are
some
things
for,
some
against,
only
a
couple.
and
he
doesn't
consult
with
the
lawyer,
all
right.
now,
in
these
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases
that
must
be
there
over
the
decades,
you
probably
looked
through
a
few
or
at
least
talked
to
your
fellow
bar
members.
how
many
have
you
found
where
you
would
say
that
a
mistrial
was
declared
despite
facts
that
are
on
your
side?
in
other
words,
there
are
going
to
be
millions
of
cases,
not
millions
but
thousands;
many
of
them
will
support
the
defense.
maybe
many
support
you.
but
i
haven't
seen
any
here
that
say
they
support
you.
so
how
many
do?
and
what
do
you
want
me
to
read
to
see
that
this
is
not
an
extreme
case
that
counts
as
an
abuse
of
the
judge's
discretion?
how
many
did
you
find
which
will
prove
to
me
this
is
not,
this
is
closer
to
the
norm?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
that's
why
i
am
asking
the
question.
what
they've
said
is,
is
it
an
abuse
of
discretion?
and
they've
also
said
the
judge
has
to
be
careful.
okay,
so
we
have
like
an
abuse
of
discretion
scale
and
this
is
pretty
far
over
on
the
abuse
of
discretion
side.
i
think
anyone
would
admit.
but
what
cases
will
show
to
me
that
it's
on
your
side,
not
quite
an
abuse
of
discretion?
or
is
this
the
most
extreme
case
in
history?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
don't
believe
it.
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
give
me
some
evidence,
like
refer
me
to
some
other
cases
or
explain
to
me
how
you
have
come
to
that
conclusion,
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
looking
on
the
scale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
you
to
look
at
this
court.
we
don't
have
a
case
where
we
said
what
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
i
want
you
to
tell
me
--
and
i've
already
said
this
twice,
but
i
am
judging
from
your
answer
you
found
no
case
supporting
it.
you
have
found
no
case
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
that
was
more
extreme
than
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
they
said
it
wasn't
an
abuse
of
discretion.
that's
what
i'm
judging
from
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
note
indicating.
there
are
five,
six
notes
they
sent
out,
and
at
9:30
in
the
morning
they
said:
judge,
we
have
a
concern
about
our
voice
levels,
disturbing.
that's
what
they
said.
then
they
asked
to
see
the
evidence
and
they
said:
explain
count
2.
then
they
said:
are
we
allowed
to
break?
and
then
they
said:
what
if
we
can't
agree?
mistrial,
retrial,
what?
and
at
12:27,
the
same
time,
they
said:
what
about
lunch?
then
he
brought
them
out
and
he
says
to
the
juror:
all
right,
do
you
believe
it's
hopelessly
deadlocked?
and
the
foreperson
said:
the
majority
of
us
don't
believe
that.
and
he
said:
don't
say
what
you're
going
to
say.
and
then
he
doesn't
have
the
lawyer
there.
okay,
that's
fairly
extreme.
so
that's
why
i
ask
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly
but
i'm
drawing
some
conclusions
from
your
silence.
you
haven't
found
a
case
supporting
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
can
--
what
--
what
is
--
looking
at
--
can
you
take
the
converse
of
the
question
i
asked
your
colleague
on
the
other
side,
if
you
can
remember
it?
i'll
--
do
you
see
what
i'm
--
on
the
scale.
i
mean,
this
is
a
fairly
simple
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
wonderful
about
this
case
is
there
is
no
disagreement
about
the
facts.
we
could
write
them
in
under
two
pages,
just
quoting
exactly
the
notes
and
exactly
what
the
colloquy
was
and
note
that
the
lawyer
wasn't
there.
so
there
we
are.
now,
imagine
that
in
front
of
you.
you
--
it's
easier
for
you
to
look
up
the
cases
than
it
is
for
him,
because
you
want
to
find
reversals,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
you
look
and
you
try
to
see
when
the
state
courts,
federal
courts
have
said
there
was
not
manifest
necessity.
so
i
have
some
time.
i
will
read
some
cases.
which
ones
do
you
want
me
to
read?
and
i
don't
need
to
read
the
standard.
i
have
the
standard.
and
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
--
i
agree
with
the
quotation
of
the
statute;
you
have
the
burden.
and
the
question
is
we
have
a
record
of
those
two
pages,
and
does
it
clearly
show
that
he
abused
his
discretion
when
he
said
there
was
manifest
necessity?
now,
i
will
read
--
whatever
cases
you
tell
me
to
read,
i
will
read.
but
i
want
to
find
facts
and
i'm
not
sure
you
found
some,
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
it
be
that
there
are
no
cases?
i
mean
really,
thousands
and
thousands
of
mistrials?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
can
it
be
that
there
are
no
cases?
are
reversals
very,
very
rare
for
manifest
necessity?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that's
good.
now,
tell
me
then
what
did
you
find?
when
you
say
"remotely
as
bad",
then
you
perhaps
found
some
where
contention
was
rejected,
or
where
contention
--
what
did
you
find?
what
did
you
find
by
way
of
cases
where
they
said
on
facts
as
bad
as
this,
or
not
quite
as
bad
as
this,
there
was
no
manifest
necessity?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
those
are
the
ones
--
so
as
i'm
seeing
this
case,
it
isn't
that
complicated.
you
know,
it's
pretty
clear
what
the
standard
is.
the
standard
is,
was
the
decision
of
the
--
of
the
state
court
reasonable
in
deciding
that
there
was
a
sound
--
sound
--
the
words
come
from
nine
wheat,
that's
--
that's,
you
know,
like
100
years
ago
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
186
years
ago
when
it
was
something
like
"sound,
careful,
exercise
patience.
"
--or
whatever,
"the
sound,
careful
exercise
of
discretion.
"
they
said
there
was.
and
the
question
for
us
is,
was
that
reasonable?
okay?
i
guess
if
the
judge
had
said,
"hey,
we
have
only
been
deliberating
half
an
hour
and
the
game
starts
in
five
minutes,
i've
got
to
get
there
--
dismissed.
"
that
would
be
unreasonable.
[laughter]
objectively
unreasonable.
so
come
as
close
as
you
can
to
that,
where
they
held
reasonable,
and
what
case
is
it?
