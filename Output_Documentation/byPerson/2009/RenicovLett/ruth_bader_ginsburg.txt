justice

because
the
foreperson
at
first
hesitated.
when
the
court
asked
the
question,
"are
you
going
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
or
not.
"
then
there's
no
response.
and
then
the
court
says,
"yes
or
no"?
and
only
at
that
second
point
does
the
foreperson
say
"no".
so
it
was
a
reluctant
"no".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
another
factor
in
this.
we
have
the
transcript.
are
you
urging
that,
because
the
trial
court
judge
was
there
on
the
spot,
saw
the
jury,
worked
with
the
jury,
that
that's
something
that
deserves
a
special
measure
of
respect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
pause,
you
agree,
between
the
foreperson's
report
and
the
court
then
said
immediately
afterward:
the
jury
is
dismissed.
so
there
was
no
interval
for
an
objection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
the
status
of
the
--
the
allen
charge
in
michigan?
has
michigan
taken
a
position
on
whether
that's
a
good
thing,
a
permissible
thing
for
a
trial
court
to
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
wasn't
requested,
either?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mcgormley,
do
we
have
any
indication
how
long
this
trial
judge
was
on
the
bench
when
this
trial
came
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
--
your
position
was
that
everybody
agrees
on
what
the
law
is:
if
there
is
a
deadlock,
a
new
trial
is
appropriate.
so
there
is
no
question
about
that
statement
of
the
law.
it's
the
fact
question,
was
this
a
deadlock,
and
up
until
now
we
have
been
talking
about
this,
including
justice
scalia,
under
the
fact
problem
of
aedpa;
that
is,
have
you
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
he
have
to
lose
at
that
point?
she
has
made
the
ruling
and
that's
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
mistrial.
the
lawyer
at
that
point
can
say:
your
honor,
i
object,
and
moreover,
i
would
like
you
to
give
the
michigan
version
of
the
allen
charge.
nothing
stopped
the
lawyer
from
doing
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
little
shaky
as
precedent
for
--
that
--
that
was
a
case
that
said:
the
trial
judge
did
right
and
no
double
jeopardy
for
a
new
trial.
but
in
passing,
to
get
there,
the
court
said:
well,
this
case
didn't
involve
that.
but
the
court
isn't
passing
on
anything
other
than
the
trial
judge
in
that
case
didn't
violate
defendant's
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mcgormley,
you
have
stressed
throughout
that
it's
not
--
not
the
question
that
justice
breyer
put,
but
there
are
two
--
you
have
emphasized
the
two
screens.
this
comes
to
us
after
we
have
the
trial
court
ruling
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
ruling.
so
the
case
isn't
all
that
easy,
without
making
the
judgment
as
though
it
were
coming
up
in
the
federal
system.
