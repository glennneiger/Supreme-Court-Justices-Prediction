justice
anthony
m.

can
you
tell
me,
along
the
line
of
--
the
same
line
of
questioning,
i
understand
about
aedpa.
i
understand
about
deference,
the
jurisdictions.
just
tell
me
a
little
bit
about
how
this
often
works
in
state
courts
and
in
federal
courts?
would
it
be
good
practice,
in
your
view
--
and
that
may
not
control
your
case,
but
would
it
be
good
practice
for
the
--
a
judge
to
have
had
exactly
this
colloquy
and
then
say:
the
jurors
are
dismissed
while
i
talk
with
counsel.
and
you
say:
counsel,
in
light
of
this
response,
i
am
prepared
to
declare
a
mistrial.
do
you
have
any
comment?
is
that
good
practice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
--
i'm
asking
if
it's
good
practice
as
a
general
practice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
--
because
that
will
bear,
ultimately,
on
a
constitutional
issue.
i
understand
deference.
i
understand
that
all
intendments
are
in
favor
of
what
the
state
supreme
court
found.
i'm
just
--
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
it
works
out
there
in
the
real
world?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
independent
obligation
is
not
reinforced
by
getting
counsel's
views
just
as
a
matter
of
good
practice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
was
a
ruling
by
the
court:
i
hereby
declare
a
mistrial.
i
suppose
you
could
have
an
objection,
but
it
would
be
very
--
the
jury
was
present
when
the
judge
said:
i
hereby
declare
the
mistrial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
would
be
rather
awkward
for
the
counsel
at
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
acrimony,
i
recognize
we
have
talked
about
it
in
arizona,
but
it
--
i
mean,
it
could
be
that
the
jurors
had
all
agreed
on
the
murder
count
and
they
were
just
quarrelling
over
whether
they
should
add
the
firearms
count,
or
the
other
way
around.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
which
case
they
would
be
much
closer
than
--
than
your
comment
about
acrimony
might
indicate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
that
case,
one
of
the
specific
factors
was
that
he
consulted
with
--
the
judge
consulted
with
counsel
before
making
the
ruling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
--
in
arizona.
