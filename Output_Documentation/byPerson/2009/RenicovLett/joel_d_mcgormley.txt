mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
this
is
a
habeas
case
arising
from
a
murder
conviction
obtained
in
the
michigan
courts,
the
threshold
question
under
aedpa
is
whether
there
is
any
clearly
established
supreme
court
precedent
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
objectively,
unreasonably
applied
in
rejecting
mr.
lett's
claims
that
the
trial
court
had
abused
its
discretion
in
--
in
discharging
the
jury
due
to
deadlock.
the
sixth
circuit
second-guessed
on
habeas,
ignored
deference
under
aedpa,
as
well
as
the
broad
discretion,
due
the
trial
court
determination.
here
there
was
a
note
suggesting
acrimonious
deliberations
received
early
on
in
the
second
day
of
deliberations,
followed
by
a
second
note
suggesting
a
deadlock
after
approximately
10
hours
of
trial
testimony
and
4
hours
of
deliberations.
the
trial
court
at
that
time
engaged
the
foreperson
in
a
colloquy,
a
two-part
colloquy,
in
which
the
foreperson
not
only
confirmed
the
content
of
the
first
note,
but
also
confirmed
the
existence
of
a
deadlock.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
justice
sotomayor,
the
first
note
was
the
note
regarding
our
raised
voices
disturbing
other
proceedings.
the
second
note
regards--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--well,
the
michigan
supreme
court
refers
to
that
as
early
on
in
the
second
day
of
deliberations.
and
then
there
is
approximately
3
hours
and
15
more
minutes
of
deliberations,
because
after
the
second
note--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--the
record
doesn't
disclose,
doesn't
disclose
that.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--justice
sotomayor,
the
first
point
i
would
make
is
that,
of
course,
this
is
on
habeas
review,
and
so
the
--
the
michigan
supreme
court
made
factual
findings
here
that
would
be
due
deference.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
the
factual
finding
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
that
--
that
there
appeared
to
be
acrimonious
deliberations.
that's
a
factual
finding
due
deference
under
(e)(1).
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
going
back
to
this
court's
opinion
in
perez,
considering
sound
judgment,
discretion,
considering
all
the
circumstances,
here
we
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
that
it
was
a
relatively
short
trial,
that
we
have
a
note
that
could
be
reasonably
interpreted
as
acrimonious
deliberations,
the
second
note
that
could
be
reasonably
construed
as
a
deadlock.
and
then
the
trial
court
did
not
declare
a
mistrial
at
that
point.
rather,
the
trial
court
brings
the
jury
out
and
engages
in
a
colloquy.
and
in
that
colloquy,
the
trial
court
accepts
the
foreperson's
answer
at
her
word.
and
that
is:
"are
you
going
to
be
able
to
reach
unanimous
verdict?
"
the
answer
being:
"no".
and
in
fact,
it's
the
sixth
circuit
who
second-guessed
in
this
case
by
saying:
you
can't
place
that
much
weight
on
that
statement
by
the
foreperson.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
i
don't
necessarily
believe
it
was
a
reluctant
no.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
and
this
court
has
qualified
that
as
broad
discretion
and
special
respect
due
the
trial
court
determination,
after
the
trial
court
is
the
one
viewing
the
jury
in
real
time.
so
absolutely.
and
in
fact,
this
--
this
risk
of
coercion
was
recognized
also
by
this
court
in
arizona
v.
washington.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
correct.
but
i
don't
know
that
minute
or
so
gap.
i
don't
know
when
mr.
gordon
snuck
out.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
it
may
be
good
practice,
but
the
question
becomes
whether
it's
constitutionally
required.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
i
would
say
--
well,
in
this
court--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--well,
i
believe
that
discussion
with
counsel
is
a
factor
in
--
in
the
consideration.
i
don't
dispute
that.
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
it's
a
requirement.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
absolutely.
and
here
--
and
here's
why.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
it's
important
in
the
coercion
context,
because
certainly
the
trial
court
has
an
independent
obligation
to
ensure
a
just
judgment.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
it
may
be.
it
may
be
reinforced
in
certain
circumstances,
but
again,
we
are
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
when
we
have
a
note
indicating
acrimony,
a
note
indicating
deadlock,
and
then
the
colloquy
in
which
there's
an
unequivocal--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--correct.
under
dennis,
if
the
defendant
consents,
then
there
is
no
double
jeopardy.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
no.
no,
there
wasn't.
but,
you
know,
the
colloquy
is
relatively
short.
but
no,
i
believe
the
defendant's
counsel
could
have
objected.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
correct.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
it
--
it
would
be
difficult
for
counsel
to
object
at
that
point,
but
i
still
think
counsel
could
have
made
a
record
immediately
at
that
point.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
that
is
possible
and
that
as
seen
in
the
webb
case
as
well,
where
the
trial
court
--
this
is
a
circuit
court--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--in
michigan
confessions
of
error
are
controlled
by
court
rule
as
a
procedural
matter,
and
the
appellate
courts
have
the
ability
to
accept
statements
that
could
be
qualified
as
a
confession
of
error
or
not.
here
the
michigan
supreme
court
addressed
this
case
on
the
merits,
the
underlying
double
jeopardy
merits.
in
much
the
same
way,
it
did
not
address
potential
waiver
or
consent
issues
by
the
defendant.
so
we
have
a
merits
opinion
here.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
the
difficult
part
in
answering
your
honor's
question
is
that
this
court
has
indicated
that
there
is
no
mechanical
formula
or
test.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
i
reach
that
conclusion
by
looking
at
this
court's
other
language,
for
instance--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--i
have
not--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--i
have
not
found
a
case
on
these
facts
with
a
note
indicating
acrimonious
deliberations,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
but
the
reference
there
about
don't
say
what
you're
going
to
say
is
likely
a
reference
to
don't
give
the
breakdown
of
your
verdict.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
it
is
petitioner's
burden.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
i
haven't
found
a
case
on
these
facts,
but
that's
consistent--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--actually,
there's
one
out
of
the
sixth
circuit,
klein
v.
leis,
from
this
very
circuit,
in
which
the
individual
--
it
was
not
a
deadlocked
jury
case,
but
the
individual
had
some
sort
of
stun
or
control
belt
on
the
defendant
and
he
lifted
it
up,
and
the
trial
court--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--but
that's--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--but
it's
still
a
manifest
necessity
determination.
in
fact,
this
court
has
indicated
that
on
the
spectrum
of
reasons
a
deadlocked
jury
warrants
the
least
amount
of
appellate
scrutiny.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
to
best
answer
your
honor's
question,
i
would
point
out
again
that
in
arizona
this
court
mentioned
that
examples
being
of
abuse
of
discretion
or
actions
that
cannot
be
condoned
are
when
the
trial
court
acts
irrationally,
irresponsibly,
or
for
pretextual
reasons.
and
in
our
yellow
brief
we
cited
several
cases
where
i
would
say
the
court
was
correct
to
find
an
abuse
of
discretion
--
the
starling
case
in
which
the
jury
is
giving
a
contrary
indication.
the
jury
in
the
starling
case
indicated
that,
we
are
making
progress
and
in
fact
can
we
have
15
more
minutes;
and
the
judge
pulls
them
out
and
declares
a
mistrial.
your
honor's
example
then
with
the
gordy
case
would
be
the
imminent
travel
plans
and
docket
considerations.
we
also
have
where
the
court
acts
sua
sponte,
and
that's
where
--
the
webb
case,
where
the
trial
court--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--well,
again,
as
i
--
as
i
mentioned,
it's
a
reasonable
view
of
the
first
note
that
it
is
indicative
of
acrimony.
it's
a
reasonable
view
of
the
second
note
that
it
was
indicative
of
a
deadlock.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
a
--
michigan
has
adopted
the
aba
standard.
michigan
has
the
instruction
3.12.
it's
not
what
we
would
call
the
traditional
allen
dynamite
charge
because
it's
not
asking
the
minority
to
give
credence
to
the
majority's
opinion.
so
there
is
a
deadlocked
jury
instruction
in
michigan.
it's
not
the
traditional
allen
dynamite
charge.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
that
was
not
--
that
was
not
done
here.
but
again,
i
think
it's
reasonable,
understanding
that
this
is
a
dual
--
dual-layered
deference
case,
being
a
habeas
case
as
well
as
the
trial
court
being
--
having
broad
discretion
to
make
this
determination,
that
when
you
have
--
have
the
notes
--
i
mean,
it
--
it
may
tell
the
--
the
trial
court
may
have
felt
that
giving
an
allen
charge
when
there's
acrimony
may
be
telling
those
minority
jurors
that
it
doesn't
matter
and
that
they
may
have
to
submit
to
the
majority
opinion.
so
i
believe
it
was
--
it
was
reasonable
for
the
michigan
supreme
court
here,
applying
aedpa
to
--
to
conclude
that
the
--
the
trial
court
acted
in
conformance
with
this--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--i
believe
that
is
permissible,
though
not
constitutionally
required.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
i
believe--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--she,
the
trial
judge--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--the--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--respectfully,
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
including
the
two
previous
notes
and
a
bifurcated
question
where--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--well
--
oh,
i
believe
it
does,
because
this
court
has
indicated
in
arizona
that
--
that
acrimony
is
a
concern.
it's
a
countervailing
concern
to
balancing
the
interest
of
the
defendant
having
his
case
decided
by
a
single
tribunal
and
fair
and
just
judgments,
as
well
as
society
having
one
fair
opportunity
to
vindicate
its
laws.
so
i
think
it's
very
much
an
appropriate
consideration.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
none.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
correct.
that's
why
it's
imperative
to
view
this
case
in
the
habeas
box
that
it
resides.
and
that
is
the
michigan
supreme
court
made
reasonable
factual
determinations
and
did
not
objectively
unreasonably
apply
this
court's
precedent.
and
the
fact
that
we
may
look
at
these
notes
and
go
one
way
or
the
other
means
that
the
state
wins.
the
state
should
prevail,
because
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
those
notes.
if
one
person
may
say,
i
don't
know
that
that
really
indicates
deadlock
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
is
looking
at
it
and
it's
a
reasonable
determination,
then
deference
should
apply
and
the
state
should
prevail.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
how
long
in
terms
of
serving
on
the
bench?
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
my
recollection
is
that
this
was
an
experienced
trial
judge
who
then
went
to
either
civil
arena
from
recorder's
court
or
retired.
so
i
believe
this
was
an
experienced
trial.
i
don't
have
the
exact
years.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
it
--
it
--
it
gets
back
to
that
fundamental--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--well,
it
gets
back
to
the
fundamental
principle
that
the
trial
court
should
be
able
to
take
--
now,
this
is
on
the
second,
but
the
initial
layer
of
deference
--
that
the
trial
court
should
be
able
to
take
the
foreperson
at
her
word
when
she
says
that
the
jury
is
deadlocked,
the
jury
is
deadlocked,
especially
--
especially
in
light
of
these--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--i
do
not
assert
that.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well,
i
guess
i
don't
quite
see
the
difference,
because
if
the
jury
is
in
--
i
--
i
think
hopelessly
deadlocked
is
probably
a
higher
standard
than
--
than
genuinely
deadlocked--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--right.
it's
a
bifurcated
question.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
it's
a
bifurcated
question,
correct.
i
mean,
the
--
the
first
one
was
regarding
confirming
the
nature
of
their
note,
and
then,
even
with
the
interruption,
there
are
--
twice
the
court
approaches
this
inability
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict.
so
again,
here,
what
is
paramount
is
that
it's
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
objectively
unreasonably
apply
this
court's
clearly
established
precedent.
there
--
there
is
no
case
that
flatly
controls
this
case,
other
than
the
braun-perez
standard.
in
fact,
the
sixth
circuit
here
created
its
own
three-part
test,
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
when
they
said
that
there
are
three
considerations
that
determine.
so
when
you
take
that
three-part
test,
which
is
not
this
court's
holdings
and
test
on
habeas,
as
well
as
the
second-guessing
of
those
predicate
factual
determinations
being,
well,
the
jury
probably
didn't
have
enough
time
to
even
review
the
witnesses,
juries
often
report
themselves
deadlocked,
we
can't
give
as
much
weight
to
this
foreperson's
statement,
it's
contrary
to
these
dual
layers
of
deference.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
thank
you.
two
brief
points.
it
is
a
petitioner's
burden
to
establish
--
clearly
establish
precedent
here
that
was
objectively--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
i'm
sorry,
it
--
it
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
lett
--
mr.
lett's
burden
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
clearly
established
precedent
that
was
objectively
and
unreasonably
applied.
to
justice
breyer,
your
question
although
not
exact
fact
patterns
and
that
is
what
i
was
struggling
with,
i
would
point
in
our
blue
brief
to
hernandez-guardado
and
lindsay
v.
smith,
two
cases
in
which
--
circuit
cases,
granted,
but
two
cases
in
which
involved
jury
deadlocks
and
counsel
was
not
asked
a
question.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
186.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
well--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--correct,
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
not
a
very
easy--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--i
would
not.
and
i--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--the
reason
why,
justice
stevens,
is
because
arizona
was
not
even
a
deadlocked
jury
case.
and
there
is
language
that
helps
flesh
out
what
an
abuse
of
discretion
would
be.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
perez.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
my
best
answer,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
best
cases
i
have
are
--
are
those
--
are
those
two,
because
this
--
this
court
has
never
overruled
a
manifest
necessity
determination
due
to
a
deadlocked
jury.
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
no,
my
point
is
that
--
is
in
the
186
years
since
perez
it's
never
happened.
it
does
not
happen.
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
broad
discretion
and
special
respect--
mr.
joel
d.
mcgormley
--well,
i
--
i
think
it
is
indicative
of
the
fact
that
this
has
never
happened
--
this
