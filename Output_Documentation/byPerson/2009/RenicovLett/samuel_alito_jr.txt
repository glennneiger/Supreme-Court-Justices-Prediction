justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
what
happened?
after
the
foreperson
said:
no,
judge,
we
are
not
going
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict,
the
judge
says:
all
right,
i
hereby
declare
a
mistrial;
the
jury
is
dismissed.
and
then
the
next
entry
in
the
transcript
that
we
have
is:
well,
mr.
gordon
snuck
away
before
we
could
set
a
new
trial
date.
now,
mr.
gordon
was
defense
--
was
the
defense
attorney?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
when
did
he
leave?
do
we
know
when
he
left?
he
was
present
when
the
judge
said
that
she
was
going
to
declare
a
mistrial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
certainly
it's
good
practice.
if
both
counsel
agree
that
there
is
manifest
necessity
for
a
mistrial,
then
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
double
jeopardy
issue
in
the
case,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
it
have
been
difficult?
why
would
it
be
difficult
for
counsel
to
say,
may
we
have
a
sidebar,
and
say,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
there
should
be
a
mistrial,
i
think
you
should
ask
the
jury
to
deliberate
further?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
isn't
what
the
judge
said
just
before
she
got
the
response.
she
said:
are
you
going
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
foreperson
said:
no,
judge.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
michigan
supreme
court
cited
four
factors
in
support
of
its
decision:
the
length
of
the
deliberations
in
relation
to
the
complexity
of
the
case,
the
heated
discussions
among
the
jurors,
the
fact
most
importantly
that
the
foreperson
said
that
the
jury
would
not
be
able
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict,
and
the
fact
that
there
was
no
objection
by
defense
counsel.
is
there
any
decision
in
this
court
that
says
that
under
--
that
in
a
case
in
which
those
four
factors
are
present,
that
the
trial
judge
may
not
grant
a
mistrial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
is
there
--
could
you
give
us
a
long
list
of
--
of
lower
court
cases
holding
that
in
a
case
where
those
four
factors
are
present,
a
trial
judge
may
not
grant
a
mistrial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
question
is
when
those
four
factors
are
present,
why
are
they
not
sufficient
to
establish
that
the
judge
was
exercising
sound
discretion?
unless
there
is
a
decision
of
this
court
or
perhaps
a
huge
body
of
lower
court
case
law,
saying
that,
no,
even
when
those
four
factors
are
present
you
may
not
grant
a
mistrial,
how
do
you
justify
the
conclusion
that
you
are
asking
us
to
draw?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
so?
if
mr.
gordon
thought
that
this
jury
was
11-to-1
for
acquittal,
do
you
think
he
would
have
been
reluctant
to
ask
for
a
sidebar
and
object
to
the
granting
of
a
mistrial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
really
saying
that?
you're
saying
that
a
lawyer
in
your
office
defending
a
client
who
thinks
that
the
jury
is
leaning,
is
11-to-1
for
acquittal,
and
the
judge
says,
well,
we're
going
to
have
a
mistrial
and
the
acquittal
is
going
out
the
window,
the
lawyer
is
going
to
be
reluctant
to
say:
judge,
may
we
have
a
sidebar,
and
then
go
to
the
sidebar
and
object
to
the
granting
of
a
mistrial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they
were
or
they
weren't.
i'm
just
asking
about
what
defense
counsel
would
do
in
that
situation.
maybe
they
are
more
timid
in
michigan
than
the
ones
i'm
familiar
with.
i
would
think
that
they
would
not
be
hesitant
to
raise
an
objection
if
they
thought
it
was
going
to
prejudice
the
client.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
are
you
suggesting
that
whenever
the
trial
judge
abuses
his
or
her
discretion
in
granting
a
mistrial,
there
can
be
relief
under
aedpa?
it
is
clearly
established
that
whenever
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion,
relief
can
be
granted
under
aedpa.
it
is
an
unreasonable
application
of
our
precedent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
think
it's
a
fair
inference
from
the
note
that
the
jury
was
stuck?
do
you
think
it's
--
it's
likely
that
they
were
just
curious
and
they
were
rolling
along
just
fine,
but
they
were
just
curious,
well,
what
if
it
happens
after
we
deliberated
a
little
more
if
we
can't
reach
a
--
a
verdict?
we
just
have
a
curiosity
about
that?
do
you
think
that's
a
fair
inference
from
that
note?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
think
there's
an
--
you
can
draw
an
inference
fairly
that
they
were
--
that
there
was
substantial
disagreement?
