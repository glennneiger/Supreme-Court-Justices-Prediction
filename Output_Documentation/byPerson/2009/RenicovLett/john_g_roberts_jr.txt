chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-338,
renico
v.
lett.
mr.
mcgormley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
--
ms.
mccowan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
would
be
gained
from
that?
i
--
the
parties,
one
says
--
let's
say
one
says
yes
and
the
other
says
no.
you
ought
to
grant
a
mistrial,
you
shouldn't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
people
usually
--
in
your
experience
is
there
usually
a
clear
breakdown
between
prosecution
and
defense
on
a
question
like
this?
my
perhaps
uninformed
view
is
presumably
the
defense,
if
they
have
got
a
deadlocked
jury,
they
want
that
to
continue,
because
all
they
need
is,
you
know,
one
holdout.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
jury
is
hopelessly
deadlocked,
is
there
a
situation
where
that
would
not
constitute
manifest
necessity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
does
get
back
to
the
factual
determination
of
deadlock,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
--
so
the
proposition
that
what
happened
here
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
cannot
be
said
to
be
clearly
established,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
anything
like
this
case
that
says
this
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
fact
that
it's
a
plurality
opinion
means
that
it
was
not
clearly
established
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
answered
an
earlier
question
that
i
asked
--
maybe
i'm
--
maybe
it
was
something
i
asked
your
friend,
although
i
doubt
it,
since
it
would
help
him
--
that
the
issue
did
come
down
to
the
factual
determination
of
deadlock,
because
if
there
is
deadlock
then
there
is
manifest
necessity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
so
the
case
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
case
of
genuine
deadlock,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
the
layers
--
with
the
two
layers
of
deference
worked
into
your
formulation.
it's
not
simply
whether
the
trial
court
erred
in
the
determination
that
there
was
a
deadlock
that
constitutes
manifest
necessity;
it's
whether
or
not
there
was
an
abuse
of
--
of
discretion
for
the
trial
judge
to
so
determine
that
we
review
under
an
additional
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
our
law
clearly
establish
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
bears
the
burden
of
showing
there's
manifest
necessity,
and
if
there
is
an
absence
of
evidence
supporting
that
burden,
hasn't
been
--
hasn't
been
--
why
isn't
that
the
answer
to
the
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
--
i'm
sorry.
please
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
what
other
explanation
is
there
for
a
note
saying
"are
we
being
too
loud",
other
than
that
there
was
some
degree
of
acrimony
on
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
you
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
a
note
came
out
saying,
are
we
being
too
loud?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
would
that
indicate
other
than
that
there
was
some
degree
of
acrimony?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
--
you
do
agree
that
there
could
be
situations
where
a
federal
court
on
direct
review
would
find
abuse
of
discretion,
and
yet
a
court
on
habeas
under
aedpa
would
say
that
that
has
to
stand?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
are
a
category
of
cases
where
a
federal
court
could
look
at
it
and
say,
that's
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
that
same
court
reviewing
it
under
habeas
would
say
you
are
not
entitled
to
relief
under
aedpa?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
you
say
that?
i
mean,
you
may
think
the
discretion
was
abused,
but
it's
not
like
he
just
suddenly
announced
there
was
going
to
be
a
mistrial.
he
exercised
discretion.
he
looked
at
the
note,
he
asked
the
question,
he's
--
are
you
hopelessly
deadlocked?
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict?
and
he
was
able
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
had
previously
sent
out
a
note
saying,
are
we
being
too
loud,
and
the
fact
he
knew,
4-1/2
hours
on
a
case
in
which
there
were
10
hours
of
testimony.
i
mean,
i
understand
your
argument
that
he
abused
his
discretion,
but
i
don't
understand
the
argument
that
he
didn't
exercise
discretion
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
she
asked
the
foreperson
a
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
did
--
where
did
--
i'm
sorry.
where
did
she
conflate
the
two
things
you
said
she
conflated,
deadlocked
and
the
other
thing?
what
was
it,
inability
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
you
got
to
read
down
further.
she
says:
"are
you
going
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
or
not?
"
and
the
foreperson
says
"no".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
--
with
respect,
it's
not
the
very
first
sign
of
disagreement.
reasonably
interpreting,
a
note
saying
"are
we
being
too
loud"
is
a
sign
of
disagreement.
and
there
is
another
note
that
comes
out:
"what
happens
if
we
can't
agree?
"
you
are
making
it
sound
more
precipitous
than
it
was.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no.
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
not
a
period
on
page
7
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
is
that
a
mistake?
there's
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--dash.
and
--
and
could
the
court
be
concerned
that
the
person
was
about
to
say,
and
again
with
deference
to
the
court,
"the
majority
--
majority
of
us
don't
believe
that.
"
--that
the
defendant
is
guilty,
that
the
defendant
is
innocent.
wasn't
the
judge
quite
correct
to
stop
her
right
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
exactly
what
she
did?
after
that
he
says
don't
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
--
or
don't
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
say.
i
don't
want
to
know
what
your
verdict
might
be
or
how
the
split
is
or
anything
like
that,
are
you
going
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict?
she
did
go
on
after
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--how
--
how
do
you
know
she
answered
for
herself?
the
judge
was
talking
--
she
can't
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
by
herself.
she
is
answering
for
the
jury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
mccowan.
mr.
mcgormley,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
mean
respondent,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
--
you
are
the
petitioner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
an
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question?
it
was
sometime
ago,
but--
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case,
09-338
renico
versus
lett.
every
now
and
then
juries
in
criminal
cases
are
not
able
to
agree
on
a
verdict
and
when
a
jury
is
genuinely
deadlocked,
the
trial
judge
may
declare
a
mistrial.
the
jury
is
dismissed
and
the
prosecutor
can
decide
whether
to
try
the
defendant
before
a
new
jury,
but
the
defendant
has
an
interest
in
having
his
case
decided
in
one
prosecution
so
the
jury
must
be
genuinely
deadlocked.
if
it
is
not,
retrial
of
the
defendant
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now
our
cases
have
said
that
the
decision
whether
to
grant
a
mistrial
is
committed
to
the
“sound
discretion”
of
the
trial
judge.
that
judge
after
all
is
on
the
scene
and
has
the
best
perspective
on
the
jury.
all
a
reviewing
court
has
is
a
cold
transcript.
in
this
case,
the
trial
was
relatively
straightforward
and
took
nine
hours.
the
jury
deliberated
for
four
hours
before
sending
a
note,
asking
what
if
we
can't
agree;
mistrial,
retrial,
what?
the
judge
called
the
jury
in
and
the
following
exchange
took
place.
the
court,
i
received
your
note
asking
me
what
if
you
can't
agree
and
i
have
to
conclude
from
that
that
is
your
situation
at
this
time.
so
i'd
like
to
ask
the
fore
person
to
identify
themselves
please.
the
fore
person
steps
forward,
identifies
herself.
the
court,
okay,
thank
you,
alright.
i
need
to
ask
you
if
the
jury
is
deadlocked?
in
other
words,
is
there
a
disagreement
as
to
the
verdict?
the
fore
person,
yes
there
is.
the
court,
alright,
do
you
believe
that
it
is
hopelessly
deadlocked?
the
fore
person,
the
majority
of
us
don't
believe
that.
and
the
court
cuts
her
off,
don't
say
which
you’re
going
to
say,
okay?
the
fore
person,
oh!
i'm
sorry.
the
court,
i
don't
want
to
know
what
your
verdict
might
be
or
how
the
split
is
or
any
of
that,
thank
you,
okay?
are
you
going
to
reach
an
unanimous
verdict
or
not?
the
fore
person
pauses.
the
court,
yes
or
no.
the
fore
person,
no
judge.
the
judge
then
declares
a
mistrial.
the
defendant
was
retried
and
found
guilty.
he
argued
that
the
judge
acted
too
quickly
in
concluding
that
the
jury
was
really
deadlocked.
the
state
supreme
court
disagreed
and
upheld
the
trial
judge's
decision.
the
defendant
then
sought
to
have
the
supreme
court's
ruling
overturned
by
a
federal
court
through
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
but
when
a
defendant
does
that,
the
federal
court
does
not
just
start
over
and
take
a
fresh
look
at
the
issue.
under
a
law
called
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
or
aedpa,
the
federal
court
may
only
rule
for
a
state
prisoner
if
the
relevant
state
court
decision
was
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law,
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
that
law
or
was
based
on
an
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts.
so
we
do
not
decide
whether
the
state
trial
judge
was
right.
we
do
not
decide
whether
the
state
supreme
court
was
right
when
it
upheld
her
decision.
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
state
supreme
court
decision
was
unreasonable
and
we
hold
it
was
not.
here
we
had
a
jury
unable
to
reach
a
verdict
in
four
hours
after
trial
that
only
lasted
nine.
you
had
a
jury
asking
what
happens
if
they
don't
agree
and
of
course
you
had
a
direct
statement
by
the
fore
person
that
the
jury
would
not
be
able
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict.
now
the
trial
judge
could
have
done
more,
a
more
thorough
job
of
probing
to
make
sure
the
jury
was
really
deadlocked
and
we’re
not
saying
that
the
state
supreme
court
decision
was
right,
reasonable
judges
can
disagree
about
that,
but
we're
saying
that
the
state
supreme
court
decision
was
not
unreasonable,
and
therefore,
we
do
not
upset
the
state
court
decision.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
sotomayor
has
joined
and
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined
in
part.
