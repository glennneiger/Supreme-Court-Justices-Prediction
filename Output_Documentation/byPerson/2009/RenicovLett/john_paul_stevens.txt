justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
in
subsequent
proceedings
the
prosecutor
acknowledged
that
the
judge
made
a
mistake?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
as
a
matter
of
michigan
practice,
could
the
trial
judge
have
interrogated
the
other
jurors
beyond
the
foreman
and
asked
them
what
they
thought
about
whether
there
was
a
deadlock?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
reason
--
do
you
suppose
there
is
any
reason
why
he
didn't
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
took
the
view
of
the
foreman,
an
answer
to
one
question,
and
that
was
it;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
conclusion
that
there
was
a
deadlock
was
based
on
one
question
and
one
answer
of
one
of
the
jurors,
and
that
was
the
whole
record
supporting
his
decision;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
other
circumstance
is
relevant?
the
fact
that
they
raised
their
voices
during
deliberation,
certainly
that
--
that
doesn't
cut
any
ice
either
way,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
quite
correct
to
say
the
legal
issue
is
whether
there's
a
deadlock?
isn't
the
legal
issue
whether
there
was
a
manifest
necessity
to
take
the
action?
isn't
that
the
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
argument
is
that
there
was
not
a
manifest
necessity
shown,
even
though
there
was
disagreement
about
whether
there
was
a
deadlock,
because
all
deadlocks
are
not
exactly
alike.
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
people
think
one
--
there
is
one
holdout,
that
means
it's
a
deadlock.
some
people
think
it
--
it
might
be
more.
i
don't
think
the
test
is
deadlock.
the
test
is
manifest
necessity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
also
you
are
ignoring
the
fact
the
first
time
the
question
was
asked,
do
you
believe
it
was
hopelessly
deadlocked
and
the
foreperson
said
the
majority
of
us
don't
believe
that.
and
then
later--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
there
is
a
period,
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
after
we
don't
believe
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
foreperson
did
not
immediately
answer.
she
had
to
ask
a
second
question,
yes
or
no.
and
the
foreperson
answered
for
herself
but
not
necessarily
for
the
jury
when
she
said
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
the
most
relevant
precedent
from
this
court
--
would
you
agree
that
the
most
relevant
precedent
from
this
court
is
arizona
v.
washington?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
the
most
relevant
precedent
from
this
court
is?
