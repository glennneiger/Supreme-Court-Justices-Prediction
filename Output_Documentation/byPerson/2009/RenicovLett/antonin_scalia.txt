she
might
have
been
sneezing.
i
mean,
we
don't
know
what
caused
the
pause,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if,
in
fact,
there
isn't
--
what
if
both
counsel
say,
no,
you
should
not
declare
a
mistrial?
can
the
judge
go
ahead
and
declare
a
mistrial?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
very
big
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
an
objection
here
by
counsel
for
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mcgormley,
is
it
your
burden
to
answer
that
question?
given
aedpa,
is
it
up
to
you
to
show
that
this
case
is
within
the
mainstream
or
is
it
up
to
the
other
side
to
show
rather
conclusively
that
it
is
not
in
the
mainstream?
i
thought
that's
what
aedpa
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
petitioner's
burden
to
show
that
there
are
cases
like
this,
where
i
guess
to
show
that
uniformly
in
cases
like
this,
there
is
no
discharge
of
the
jury.
and
i'm
not
aware
that
they
have
carried
that
burden.
but
we
will
ask
when
they
come
up.
it
is
their
burden,
however.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
again,
that's
--
that's
not
your
burden.
we
are
operating
here
under
a
statute
which
says:
"in
a
proceeding
instituted
by
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
by
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court,
a
determination
of
a
factual
issue
made
by
a
state
court
shall
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
"
"the
applicant
shall
have
the
burden
of
rebutting
the
presumption
of
correctness
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
"
now,
what
is
the
factual
determination
that
has
been
made
here?
i
assume
it's
the
factual
determination
that
the
jury
was
deadlocked.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
has
to
be
rebutted
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
you
answer
that
to
those
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mcgormley,
what
evidence
was
there
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
was
not
deadlocked?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
presumably
what
the
other
side
has
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
if
--
if
we
accept
the
factual
finding
of
the
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
--
ms.
mccowan,
you
are
--
you
are
arguing
the
case
as
--
as
though
the
--
the
only
question
for
us
is
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
district
judge
--
by
the
trial
judge
here.
that
would
certainly
be
the
case
if
this
is
coming
up
through
the
federal
system
and
we
had
a
federal
trial
judge
who
had
made
this
determination,
but
it
is
not.
it
--
it
is
coming
up
from
a
state
court
and
congress
enacted
a
statute
designed
specifically
to
reduce
the
interference
of
federal
courts
with
--
with
state
justice.
and
that
statute
says
specifically
that
where
there
has
been
a
factual
finding
by
the
state
court,
it
cannot
be
contradicted
by
--
by
the
federal
courts
unless
it
is
refuted
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
now,
what
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
there
here
that
there
was
not
a
deadlocked
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
was
the
basis
for
that
declaration
of
mistrial?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
michigan
supreme
court's
determination
is
simply
a
determination
of
the
same
fact:
there
was
a
manifest
necessity
because
the
jury
was
deadlocked.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that
factfinding
is
implicit
not
--
not
only
in
what
the
trial
court
did,
but
also
in
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
our
--
but
our
cases
have
required
much
--
much
more
than
that,
much
more
than
referring
to
a
generalized
standard
that
our
opinions
have
set
forth.
they
have
required
proving
that
the
application
of
that
standard
in
our
opinions
comports
with
the
provision
of
the
statute
that
requires
you
to
show
that
the
claim
resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
contrary
to
or
involved
in
unreasonable
application
of,
clearly
established
federal
law,
as
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
now,
our
cases
don't
show
that
you
can
simply
come
in
and
say,
well,
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
that
was
clearly
established
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
and
therefore
all
i
have
to
show
is
that
this
is
an
abuse
of
discretion.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
our
cases
show
you
have
to
show
that
the
standard
as
applied
by
our
cases
does
not
cover
your
situation.
and
you
don't
have
any
cases
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be.
that
may
well
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
says
it's
a
terrible
statute,
but
there
it
is.
it
says
it
has
to
be
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law
as
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
and
you
are
saying,
no,
it's
enough
if
it's
established
by
an
unbroken
line
of
lower
court
decisions.
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
that's
right
and
maybe
it's
wrong,
but
the
state
courts
thought
that
it
was
evidence
of
acrimony,
which
it
could
be.
and
you
say:
well,
it
also
couldn't
be.
that
may
well
be.
but
we
are
bound
to
accept
the
factual
determination
of
the
state
court,
unless
you
can
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
that's
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
waste
your
time.
i
will
look
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
waste
your
argument
time.
i
will
look
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
standard
of
review
for
setting
aside
a
determination
of
the
state
supreme
court
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
standard
of
review
for
reviewing
a
federal
district
court
and
a
federal
court
of
appeals
despite
aedpa?
we
simply
look
and
see
whether
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
if
there
has,
we
set
aside
the
state
supreme
court
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
objectively
unreasonable,
you
say,
whenever
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
--
by
the
trial
court,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
just
abuse
of
discretion;
it's
abuse
of
discretion
plus
something
else?
plus
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
"objectively
unreasonable"
is
already
built
into
the
criterion
of
abuse
of
discretion.
you
don't
abuse
your
discretion
if
what
you
have
done
is
reasonable,
you
know,
within
the
ballpark.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
doubling
up
here.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
how
it
works.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
always
have
to
poll
the
jury,
is
that
what
you
are
saying
is
a
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
aware
that
you
would
always
have
to
poll
the
jury,
and
i
could
see
some
real
disadvantages
to
it
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it
perhaps
puts
more
pressure
on
those
who
are
the
--
the
holdouts,
it
identifies,
in
some
cases,
whose
are
the
holdouts.
i'm
not
aware
that
that's
a
requirement.
