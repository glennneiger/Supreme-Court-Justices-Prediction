ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
habeas
relief
was
properly
granted.
i
would
like
to
first
answer
justice
ginsburg's
somewhat
easy
question
for
me.
judge
brown
was
sworn
into
service
on
january
1st
of
1991.
at
the
time
of
this
trial
she
had
been
on
the
bench
approximately
6-1/2
years.
we
are
not
disputing
her
experience
as
a
trial
judge.
i
do
disagree
with
my
friend's
contention
that
the
sixth
circuit
articulated
any
specific
test.
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
was
set
forth
some
considerations
or
some
guidelines,
including
the
first
of
which,
that
the
court
heard
the
--
heard
the
opinions
of
the
parties.
and
that
does
go
a
long
way,
justice
kennedy,
toward
the
idea
that
the
judge
is
exercising
sound
discretion.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
at
the
very
least,
it
evidences
that
the
trial
judge
at
least
considered
that
there
were
--
that
there
competing
interests
and
--
and
debated
whether
to
--
to
dismiss
the
jury,
which
is
an
extraordinarily
drastic
remedy.
and
instead,
our
position
is
that
there
really
is
no
down
side
to
talking
with
counsel.
you
would
be
able
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
parties'
arguments,
you
would
be
able
to--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--my
--
my
experience
--
there
is
a
range
of
things
that
are
going
on.
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
--
i
--
i
think
it
just
--
it
just
depends
on
a
variety
of
the
circumstances.
but
yes,
i
think
that
the
case
law
generally
presumes
that
the
defendant
does
want
the
first
jury
to
deliberate
to
verdict.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
first,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
--
i
--
i
disagree
with
the
--
with
the
premise
that
--
that
there
was
a
factual
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
the
jury
was
in
fact
deadlocked.
the
judge
acquired
or
extracted
the
"no"
answer
and
then
immediately
declared
a
mistrial.
the
ruling
that--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well,
presumably
on
these
facts
it
would
be
that
--
that
--
her
estimation
that
the
jury
was
deadlocked.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
but
there
is
no
actual
specific
ruling.
and
instead,
what
we
are
focused
here
on
is
the
michigan
supreme
court's
determination
that
there
was
manifest
necessity,
and
in
the
absence
of
the
trial
judge
exercising
sound
discretion,
there
is
no
--
the
reason
for
the--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well,
my--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--my
understanding
of
manifest
necessity
is
that
that
was
a
legal
determination
by
the
michigan
supreme
court,
that
there
was
--
according
to
this
court's
precedent,
there
was
manifest
necessity.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
typically,
a
genuinely
and
hopelessly
deadlocked
jury
does
constitute--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--generally,
yes
--
yes,
i
believe
so.
but
in--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--no,
there
are
no
specific
requirements.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
no.
but
the
law
does
still
require
that
the
judge
exercise
sound
discretion
in
--
in
making
a
determination
that
there--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well,
i
--
i
under
--
i
think
i
understand
the
question.
i
do
--
i
do
recognize
that
there
are
no
specific
requirements,
and
that
in
the
absence
of
that,
that
there
is
nothing
specific
that
the
trial
judge
was
required
to
do
beyond
the
exercise
of
sound
discretion.
and
in
this
case
the
judge
--
the
record
does
not
support
that
the
judge
did
exercise
sound
discretion.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
right.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--indeed,
there--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well,
i
--
i
--
i
did
undertake
tremendous
research,
as
did
my
staff,
and
i
did
not
find
--
i
mean,
a
short
answer
is
i
did
not
find
anything
that
looks
even
remotely
as
bad
as
this.
now--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well,
i
guess
the
short
answer
is
that
--
that
there
was
nothing
exactly
on
point.
i
mean,
there
were
--
there
were
cases
where
the
judge
acted
abruptly
and
hastily
and
then
there
were
cases
where
the
judge
did
consider
the
--
the
options
of
the
parties.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
has
to
be
established
at
--
at
a
granular
level.
this
court
does
require
still
that
the
--
that
the
trial
judge
exercise
sound
discretion
in
making
the
determination
that
there
was
manifest
necessity.
and
the
case
law--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well,
i
--
i
do
believe
that
this
case
looks
something
like
--
jorn,
which
is
a
plurality
opinion
from
this
court,
where
the
trial
judge
acted
without
warning,
acted
sua
sponte,
no
warnings
to
the
parties
whatsoever,
and
immediately
declared
a
mistrial;
was
acting
irrationally,
irresponsibly--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--but
in
arizona
v.
washington
this
court
quoted
jorn
for
the
proposition
that
when
the
trial
judge
acts
irrationally
and
irresponsibly
and
precipitously,
that
their
action
--
that
their
ruling
will
not
be
upheld;
and
instead,
sound
discretion
requires
that
the
trial
judge
act
carefully
and
deliberately.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
i
do
understand
--
well,
i
guess
the
best
answer
that
i
have
for
that
is
that,
why
there
are
no
cases,
is
maybe
because
--
i
mean,
i
don't
know,
but
what
i
--
what
i
came
up
with
or
theorized
is
that
i
think
that
for
the
most
part
trial
courts
understand
that
this
is
a
tremendous
obligation
that
they
must
exercise
sound
discretion.
and
for
the
most
part
for
186
years
this
has
pretty
much
worked.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
and
there's
nothing--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--precisely,
your
honor.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
precisely.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
i
agree.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
that,
when
i
answered
that
question,
that
you
were
asking
if
typically,
if
the
jury
is
genuinely
deadlocked,
does
that
constitute
an
example
of
manifest
necessity?
i'm
sorry
for
the--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well,
no,
i
believe
that
the
case
ultimately
comes
down
to
--
i
am
sorry
if
i
misspoke
before.
i
believe
that
the
case
ultimately
comes
down
to
whether
the
michigan
supreme
court
unreasonably
applied
this
court's
precedent
in
finding
that
the
trial
judge
exercised
--
that
there
was
manifest
necessity
in
the
absence
of
the
trial
judge
exercising
sound
discretion.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
my
understanding
of
2254
is
that
it
does
take
into
consideration
the
contours
of
the
underlying
constitutional
violation,
and
it
still
is
our
position
that
if
the
--
if
the
trial
judge
was
not
exercising
sound
discretion,
that
it
--
that
it
can't
be
objectively
unreasonable
for
the
michigan
supreme
court
to
have
found
that,
that
that
is
necessarily
contemplated
by
2254.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
that
certainly
sounds
fair.
i
don't
want
to
quibble,
but
i
think
that
the
--
my
understanding
of
the
law
is
that
when
--
when
there
is
an
objection
by
the
defense,
then
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
opportunity
to
object.
so
i'm
not
sure
that--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--i
think,
yes,
practically
--
practically
speaking,
i
think
he
probably
would
have
been
reluctant
to
jump
up
and
--
i
mean,
this
is
a
friday
afternoon
and
the
judge
has
essentially
released
them
for
the
day--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well,
i
think
just
as
a
practical
matter,
having
the
jury
hear
that
the
defense
does
not
want
the
jury
to
leave,
the
potential
for
prejudice
would
be
tremendous.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
that
the
parties
would
have
been
reluctant
to
do
that.
and
i
think--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
how
we
--
we
would
know
on
these
facts
that
the
jury
was
11-to1
for
acquittal.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
i
certainly
would
hope
so
as
well.
but
here
i
think
that
it
was
all
just
done
just
so
fast
and
without
warning
and
truly
without
any
opportunity
to
object.
and
so
for
that
reason,
i
--
i
think
that
the
lack
of
objection
really
doesn't
do
anything
to
fortify
the
conclusion
that
there
was
manifest
necessity
in
these
facts.
instead--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--no.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
even
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
jury
had
become
--
had
completely
devolved
at
that
point
and
they
were
no
longer
--
i
think
that--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--not
at
all.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
i
think
it
just
also
indicates
they
maybe
they
just
don't
want
anybody
to
hear
them
and
they
want
to
make
sure
that
they
are
not
being
overheard,
and
that,
you
know,
they
have
some
privacy
in
their
deliberations
and
freedom
to,
you
know,
engage
in
a
--
in
a
free
debate,
as
loud
as
they
want
to
be.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
--
i
mean,
i
suppose
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
however
inartfully,
is
that
i
don't
think
we
can
do
anything
other
than
just
take
that
note
at
face
value.
they
send
out
a
note
saying:
we
have
a
concern
that
our
voice
levels
may
be
disturbing
the
other
proceedings.
that's
it.
it
did
not--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--i'm
not
sure
--
i
mean,
maybe
i
am
just
not
understanding
the
michigan
supreme
court
opinion,
but
i
don't
know
that
they
actually
made
a
finding
that
that
was,
in
fact,
evidence
of
acrimony.
i
thought
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
said
that
may
indicate
that
they
perhaps
had
become
--
that
the
deliberations
had
become
acrimonious.
and
i
--
and
i
think
that
that's
a
credible
point.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
i'm
sorry.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
i
think
arizona
v.
washington
clearly
establishes
the
law
that
the
trial
judge
must
exercise
sound
discretion
in
finding
a
manifest
necessity.
and
in
this
case,
on
these
facts,
it
was
objectively
unreasonable
for
the
michigan
supreme
court
to
have
found
that
there
was
manifest
necessity
in
the
absence
of
any
discretion
being
exercised
whatsoever
by
the
trial
judge.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
in
this
case,
that
he
--
that
the
trial
judge
failed?
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
oh,
right.
in
--
right,
exactly.
in
arizona
v.
washington,
what
this
court
had
found
is
that
--
that
the
judge
did
exercise
discretion;
that
was
--
that
was
evidenced
by
the
judge
giving
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
weigh
in
on
it.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
but
i
thought
that
this
court
did
say
that
in
any
mistrial
declaration,
the
trial
judge
is
obligated
to
still
exercise
sound
discretion,
and
a
review
in
court
must
satisfy
itself
that,
in
accordance
with
perez,
that
the
judge
did
in
fact
exercise
sound
discretion
in
finding
that
there
was
manifest
necessity.
and
i
think
that
this
case
looks
different
from
washington
and
may
be
similar
to
what
was
going
on
in
jorn,
where
the
judge
acted
without
warning,
without
any
opportunity
for
the
parties
to
weigh
in
on
the
matter,
and
simply
declared
a
mistrial,
which
this
court
found
to
be
irrational,
irresponsible,
and
precipitous.
and
we--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--i'm
sorry.
just
to
clarify.
you
are
saying
if
the
trial
judge
abused
--
in
fact
abuses
his
discretion?
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
yes.
i
think
that
if
the
michigan
--
on
these
facts,
for
the
michigan
supreme
court
to
have
found
that
there
--
that
there
was
manifest
necessity
in
the
absence
of
the
judge
exercising
any
discretion
whatsoever,
that
that
was
in
fact,
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court's
precedent.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
no,
i'm
sorry.
to
clarify,
it
still
has
to
be
whether
--
we
are
looking
at
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
here.
we
are
in
--
on
habeas,
you
are
looking
at
the
last
reasoned
state
court's
opinion.
and
if
the
state
supreme
court
--
the
last
reasoned
court
opinion
says
--
makes
an
objectively
unreasonable
determination,
under
this
court's
clearly
established
precedent
then
relief
will
be
warranted.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
if
the
trial
judge
does
not
exercise
any
discretion
whatsoever
and
acts
irrationally,
irresponsibly,
and
precipitously,
i
believe
that
relief
would
be
warranted,
even
under
habeas
review.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
it's
--
it's
whether
the
michigan
--
whether
the
--
the
decision
under
review,
whether
it
was
an
objectively
unreasonable
determination
of
this
court's
precedent.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
yes.
and
i
want
to
clarify.
i
think
my
understanding
is
that
it's
not
just
whether
this
court
disagrees.
it
does
still
has
to
be
an
objectively
unreasonable
determination.
so
it's
not
just
simply
whether
--
whether
this
court
or
any
habeas
court
reviewing
it
would
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
it
still
has
to
be
objectively
unreasonable.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
i
think
that
that
is
right.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
our
argument
is
that
the
trial
court
was
not
in
the
ballpark
here.
the
trial
court
in
this
case
did
not
exercise
any
discretion
whatsoever,
let
alone
sound
discretion.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
my
--
my
argument
is
that
the
judge
was
not
exercising
sound
discretion
because
she
was
not
responsibly
gathering
the
facts.
she
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
jury
was
genuinely
deadlocked
before
she
even
asked
a
single
question.
she
got
a
--
a
note
from
the
jury--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--but
if
i
could
just
back
up
a
couple
lines,
she
received
the
note
saying:
what
if
we
can't
agree.
and
she
said:
i
have
to
conclude
from
that,
that
that
is
your
situation
at
this
time.
so
she
had
already
reached
the
conclusion
that
they
were
deadlocked
before
even
asking
a
single
question.
and
then
from
there
she
--
she
misdefines,
for
lack
of
a
better
description
--
she
conflated
mere
disagreement
with
deadlock,
never
corrected
that
--
that
--
that
erroneous
definition.
and
she
corralled
the
--
the
foreperson
in
a
matter
of
seconds--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--i'm
in
the
petition
appendix
at
page
94a,
where
she
says
--
i'm
sorry;
at
the
bottom
of
93a.
she
said:
"i
need
to
ask
if
the
jury
is
deadlocked?
"
"in
other
words,
is
there
a
disagreement
as
to
the
verdict?
"
disagreement
is
not--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--but
in
the
absence
of
an
expression
of
deadlock
from
the
entire
jury,
on
these
facts
in
this
case,
it
was
unreasonable
for
the
michigan
supreme
court
to
find
that
that
satisfied
the
trial
judge's
obligation
to
exercise
sound
discretion.
at
a
minimum,
the
trial
judge
is
required
to
responsively
gather
the
facts.
in
this
case,
she
--
she
acted
hastily
and
precipitously
and
without
regard
for
my
client's
right
to
have
this
first
jury
deliberate
to
a
verdict.
she
declared
a
mistrial
at
the
very
first
sign
of
disagreement
and
did
not
give
anybody
an
opportunity
to
weigh
in
on
that
before
she
declared--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--well--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--i
thought
there
was
a
dash.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
well,
it
may
be
correct
to
stop
her
right
there,
but
there
is
other
ways
to
figure
out
exactly
what
the
foreperson
was
trying
to
explain.
and
if
she
was
trying
to
say,
well,
the
majority
of
us
think
we
can
keep
going,
then
it
was
--
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
trial
judge
to
--
to
do
more.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--i
--
i
think
that
really
at
best,
though
--
given
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
at
best
that
was
an
expression
of
the
foreperson's
opinion,
that
the
jury
would
not
likely
be
able
--
but
that
is
not
a
statement.
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
no,
it's
not
--
it's
not--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--it's
certainly
not
a
requirement
and
we
were
not
saying
that
it
is
a
requirement.
but
on
these
facts
when
the
jury
has
simply
sent
the
foreperson
out
to
gather
more
information,
the
trial
judge
was
required
to,
in
some
way,
either
--
either
assure
itself
that
the
--
that
the
jury
as
a
whole
did
agree
with
the
foreperson's
expression--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--i
think
all
that
is
fair
is
that
they
were
just
trying
to
gather
more
information.
and
that
they
--
but
there
is
no--
ms.
marla
r.
mccowan
--no,
i
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
means
that
there
is
substantial
disagreement.
they
might
have
been
having
trouble.
