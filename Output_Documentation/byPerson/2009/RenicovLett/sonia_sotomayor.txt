justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
the
content
of
the
first
note
was
a
query
of
the
court.
and
that
query
was:
"what
happens
if
we
can't
reach
a
verdict?
"
isn't
that
substantially
different?
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
jury
is
trying
to
figure
out
what
are
the
consequences
of
its
actions
and
whether
reaching
a
consensus
is
possible?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
how
long
before
that
last
note
was
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
anybody
hear
the
voices?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
facts
found
by
the
lower
courts
or
the
trial
courts
show
that
the
court
acted,
quote,
and
this
is
from
our
earlier
perez
case,
the
very
first
in
this
area,
"deliberately,
responsibly,
and
not
precipitously.
"
in
declaring
a
mistrial.
what
in
the
facts
you
have
recited--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--show
that
activity?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
the
factual
finding
that
you
think
we
have
to
give
deference
to?
i
know
the
facts
you've
recited.
there
don't
appear
to
be
any
of
the
facts
with
respect
to
what
occurred
during
the
activity.
so
what
factual
finding
do
we
have
to
give
deference
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i'm
not
sure
how
that
finding
supports
the
finding,
or
a
finding,
that
the
court
was
acting
deliberately,
responsibly,
and
not
precipitously.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
have
you
found
any
case
where
a
judge
has
declared
a
mistrial
without
conferring
with
counsel,
where
the
declaration
was
upheld?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well
you
can't
read
from
that
one,
because
in
that
one
it
was
--
the
mistrial
was
held,
not
because
of
a
jury
deadlock,
but
because
of
improper
prejudicial
actions
during
the
trial.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
those
are
different
questions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
yes,
but
that
doesn't
mean
none.
what
--
other
than
we
have
cases
where
judges
have
declared
mistrials
because
they
are
going
on
vacation.
those
are
easy,
okay?
but
somewhere
the
word
"abuse
of
discretion"
means
that
someone
has
discretion,
but
is
improperly
exercising
it.
what
facts
would
it
take
for
you
to
believe
that
that
would
have
been
the
case?
what
do
you
have
to
take
out
of
this
case
to
say,
ah,
that
was
--
that
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion?
what
point?
if
he
got
the
note
and
declared
a
mistrial,
that
would
be
enough,
right?
or
would
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
isn't
that
this
one,
meaning
the
jury
doesn't
say,
we
are
deadlocked,
hopelessly
deadlocked,
we
cannot
reach
a
verdict.
it
asks:
what
happens
if
we
don't?
and
the
foreperson
hasn't
conferred
with
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
as
a
group
they
believe
they
are
hopelessly
deadlocked.
why
isn't
this
precipitous
action?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
can't
say,
can
you,
that
every
time
the
jury
records
that
it
can't
reach
a
verdict
or
it
hasn't
reached
a
unanimous
verdict,
that
that's
a
legal
deadlock
requiring
a
mistrial,
can
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
obviously
the
word
"deadlock",
and
as
i
read
the
judge's
questions,
he
defined
it
merely
as
a
disagreement
as
to
the
verdict.
and
later
he
uses
"hopelessly
deadlocked",
but
changes
the
question
when
he
asks
the
foreperson
to
respond.
isn't
there
a
difference
between
hopelessly,
i.e.,
no
further
deliberations
is
likely
to
reach
a
verdict,
as
opposed
to
you
can't
ever
reach
a
verdict?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
there
is
no
case
in
our
jurisprudence
with
identical
or
nearly
identical
facts,
so
this
is
not
under
the
24
--
of
2254(d)(1).
so
it
has
to
be
under
the
"unreasonable
application".
particularly
for
me,
what
supreme
court
precedent
do
you
think
was
unreasonably
applied,
and
explain
how
and
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
suggesting
that
you
need
a
precedent
overruling
a
lower
court
decision
before
we
could
declare
that
something
was
unreasonable
--
that
our
precedent
was
unreasonably
applied?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
could
also
be
consistent
with
the
fact
that
perez
was
clear
enough
that
judges
have
to
act
slowly
and
--
and
with
thought,
and
that
lower
courts
are
catching
those
when
they
are
not.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
it
cuts,
is
what
i'm
saying.
