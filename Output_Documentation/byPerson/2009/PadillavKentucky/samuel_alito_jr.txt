justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
it
be
limited
to
a
decision
to
plead
guilty?
what
if
a
decision
to
plead
guilty
would
have
lesser
immigration
consequences
than
a
guilty
verdict
after
--
after
going
to
trial?
wouldn't
you
have
the
same
situation
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
--
what
if
an
offer
is
made
for
a
plea
to
an
offense
that
would
have
lesser
immigration
consequences
than
the
offense
for
which
the
person
might
be
convicted
if
the
person
goes
to
trial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
--
and
the
attorney
doesn't
fully
apprise
the
client
of
the
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
see
a
difference
in
principle
between
the
two
situations
with
respect
to
the
issue
that
is
before
us
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
argument
has
--
has
an
appeal
because
removal
is
such
a
harsh
consequence,
particularly
for
someone
like
your
client
who
had
been
in
the
united
states
for
a
long
time.
but
what
troubles
me
about
it
is
the
situation
in
which
the
defendant
claims,
let's
say
5
years
after
entering
a
guilty
plea
or
after
the
passage
of
some
time
that
mis-advice
was
given
and
the
attorney
on
the
other
side
is
a
busy
public
defender
who
by
that
time
has
handled
500
cases
and
is
unable
to
remember
what,
if
anything,
was
said
about
the
immigration
consequences
of
the
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
file.
how
are
those
cases
going
to
be
handled?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
different
in
that
the
ordinary
strickland
claim
concerns
things
that
happen
at
trial
and
relate
to
strategy
in
a
criminal
case,
as
to
which
the
public
defender
or
other
defense
attorney
presumably
has
expertise?
but
what's
the
answer
to
this
question:
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
says:
my
attorney
said
that,
don't
worry
about
it,
you
are
not
going
to
get
removed.
and
the
lawyer
says:
well,
here's
my
file;
i
have
nothing
in
this
whatsoever
about
having
said
anything
about
removal
and
i
can't
remember
the
particulars
of
every
single
conversation
i
had
with
this
attorney
5
--
with
this
client,
5
years
ago.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
a
situation
where
the
defendant
is
concerned
about
removal
--
the
removal
consequences?
and
this
is
--
let's
say
this
is
a
case
out
in
some
rural
jurisdiction,
you
have
got
a
public
defender
or
a
retained
attorney,
and
the
--
the
--
the
attorney
is
--
you
know,
provides
advice
based
on
the
criminal
law
consequences
and
the
client
says:
well,
i'm
also
concerned
about
the
immigration
consequences.
and
the
lawyer
says,
well,
immigration
law
is
very
complicated
and
i'm
not
an
expert
on
this
and
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you.
and
so
the
client
says
--
and
the
lawyer
says,
if
you
want
to
know
about
that
you've
got
to
get
a
deportation
--
you
have
got
to
get
an
immigration
lawyer.
and
the
alien
defendant
says:
well,
i
have
no
money;
that's
why
you
were
appointed
to
represent
me.
how
am
i
going
to
get
advice
on
the
immigration
law
issue?
and
the
lawyer
says:
well,
that's
just
too
bad
for
you.
and
that's
the
line
you
want
us
to
draw?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
situation
where
the
attorney
says
nothing
about
--
i
mean,
removal
is
--
is
out
there
as
--
as
a
real
possibility,
but
it
just
doesn't
occur
to
the
--
the
defendant
and
the
attorney
doesn't
even
mention,
you
know,
you
might
--
you
might
want
to
think
about
the
removal
consequences
of
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
situation
where
the
--
the
defendant
would
have
made
sacrifices
and
obtained
competent
immigration
advice,
were
it
not
for
affirmative
misrepresentations
by
criminal
defense
--
by
criminal
defense
attorneys?
the
criminal
defense
attorney
says
don't
worry
about
it,
you
are
not
going
to
be
removed.
and
the
defendant
says,
you
really
sure
about
that?
because
if
you
are
not,
you
know,
my
relatives
are
getting
a
second
mortgage
on
the
house
and
we
are
going
to
go
hire
an
immigration
lawyer
so
we
can
be
absolutely
sure
about
that
--
this.
and
the
criminal
attorney
says
i'm
an
expert
on
this,
i've
just
had
--
you
know,
six
hours
of
cle
on
immigration
law,
and
in
reliance
on
that
faulty
advice
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
and
finds
himself
facing
removal.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
just
to
be--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--just
to
be
clear
about
the
scope
of
your
argument
--
maybe
you
could
just
clarify.
which,
if
any
of
the
following,
would
you
not
put
in
the
same
category
as
advice
about
immigration
consequences:
advice
about
consequences
for
a
conviction
for
a
sex
offense,
the
loss
of
professional
licensing
or
future
employment
opportunities,
civil
liability,
tax
liability,
right
to
vote,
right
to
bear
arms.
are
they
all
in
the
same
category?
or
do
you
--
do
you
draw
a
line
some
place?
