mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
kentucky
supreme
court
announced
a
categorical
rule
so
restrictive
of
the
sixth
amendment
that
the
united
states
government
disavows
it.
the
court
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
never
provides
a
remedy
to
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
to
a
crime
on
the
false
advice
of
his
attorney
that
he
would
not
be
deported
as
a
result.
the
narrowest
ground
on
which
this
court
may
reverse
the
kentucky
supreme
court
is
to
hold
that
mis-advice
claims
are
cognizable
under
the
sixth
amendment.
any
advice
that
a
lawyer
actually
gives
to
a
defendant
on
whether
to
plead
guilty
is
advice
affecting
criminal
liability.
such
advice
must
meet
sixth
amendment
competency
standards.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
think,
for
mis-advice,
the
test
would
be
whether
it's
a
material
misrepresentation
that
would
be
material
to
a
reasonable
defendant
in
deciding
whether
to
plead
guilty,
so
it--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i
think
to
plead
guilty
is
the
key
strategic
decision
that
is
in
the
--
in
the
client's
sole
duty
and
prerogative,
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i'm
not
aware
of
any
consequences
that
would
depend
on
whether
the
conviction
was
based
on
a
guilty
plea
or
a
trial.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
that
would
be
subject--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--and
he
goes
to
trial?
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
think
that
--
that
would
only
be
a
strickland
claim
if
this
court
were
prepared
to
rule
that
going
to
trial
is
ever
prejudiced
under
strickland,
and
there
is
a
circuit
split
on
that.
but
the
concern
of
the
sixth
amendment--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i'm
not
sure
that
there
would
be.
provided
the
court
would
recognize
that
as
prejudice,
i
think
they
would
all
be
under
strickland
claims.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
your
honor,
the
issue
here
is
simply
the
legal
standard
that
applies
to
any
of
--
any
of
these
claims,
and
it
would
be
the
same
two-part
standard
under
strickland
v.
washington.
so
there
--
there
is
no
need
to
draw
lines.
if
this
court
is
troubled
by
a
broad
rule
and
is
inclined
not
to
issue
a
general
rule,
it
may
simply
recognize
deportation
as
among
the
few
collateral
consequences
that
is
so
severe
and
so
material
in
a
high
number
of
cases
in
which
it
applies
that
the
strickland
claim
should
be
allowed
to
go
forward.
and
it
can
leave
for
another
day
whether
there
are
other
consequences
that
are
too
burdensome
for
the
system
to
recognize.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
precisely
why
we
have
the
contextual
inquiry
of
strickland.
and
certainly,
parental
termination
may
in
a
given
case
be
so
severe
a
consequence
that
it
would
be
material.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
but
that
--
most
of
these
failure
to
advise
claims
will
be
very
difficult
to
plead
and
to
prove--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
sixth
amendment
is
a
source
of
independent
rights
and
the
question
is:
what
is
the
--
the
lawyer's
duty
as
distinct
from
the
court.
and
the
lawyer
has
the
distinct
duty
to
assess
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
plea--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--that
may
be
true
for
a
due
process
claim,
your
honor.
but
the
lawyer
still
has
an
obligation
to
competently
represent
him,
competently
assess
the
legal
risks,
and
advise
the
client.
those
are
fundamental
to
lawyering.
and
strickland--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--yes,
it
certainly
matters,
because
that
goes
to
the
question
of
prejudice
at
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
prejudice
standard
is
subjective
in
the
sense
that
it
must
account
for
the
subjective
risk
preferences
of
the
defendant
as
between
incarceration
and
deportation.
but
at
an
evidentiary
hearing
the
defendant
must
be
able
to
prove
that
he
has
a
triable
case,
that
a
rational
jury
could
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
--
or
could
find
reasonable
doubt,
rather,
as
to
at
least
one
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
i
think
that,
your
honor,
that
is
no
different
than
any
strickland
claim
that
would
be
brought
in
the
same
time
frame.
there
are
--
remember
that
ineffective
assistance
claims
are
almost
always
brought
as
collateral
attacks
and
there
are
many
federal
and
state
strict
ures
on
bringing
those
claims,
including
timeliness.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
categorically
different
from
the
ordinary
strickland
claim
in
your
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
your
honor,
i
think
witness
recognition
arises
in
any
number
of
strickland
claims.
and
certainly
i
think
that
the
courts
can
resolve
that
as
to
whether
they
found
--
find
that
he
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
--
that
that
statement
was
made.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
that's
a
due
process
inquiry
that
is
implemented
by
rule
11
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
don't
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is
that
there
are
all
manner
of
strategic
types
of
advice
that
counsel
give
that
are
no
province
of
the
district
court.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
it
would
not.
it
would
be
--
it
would
probably
be
a
salutary
practice
in
about
half
the
states.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
no,
your
honor.
my
only
point
is
it
would
not
be
required
under
rule
11
or
required
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
it
would
be
a
beneficial
practice,
but
if
the
attorneys
live
up
to
their
obligations
to
properly
apprise
the
clients,
then
that
is
unnecessary,
because
the
brady
voluntariness
standard
is
predicated
on
an
assumption
that
the
defendant
has
been
competently
advised
by
his
counsel.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
it's
a
much
more
limited
advisement.
what
they
tend
to
advise
is
that,
you
may
be
subject
to
immigration
consequences.
but
they
don't
actually
make
any
determination.
and
again,
that
goes
to
the
difference
between
the
function
of
the
counsel
and
a
court.
the
court
is
not
aware
of
the
defendant's
circumstances.
it
does
no
investigation
of
the
case.
counsel
does,
and
counsel
is
the
only
one
that
actually
advises
you
whether
to
accept
the
plea
or
not.
and
that's
the
key
distinction
between
a
court--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--your
honor,
i
am
not
departing
from
the
focus
on
the
guilty
plea.
the
distinction
is
that
the
counsel
has
a
duty
to
recommend
whether
the
defendant
accepts
the
plea
or
not.
and
he
cannot
do
that
by
simply
focusing
on,
in
isolation,
on
the
criminal
consequences.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
touchstone
for
the
attorney's
advice
is
whether
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
client.
and
his
duty
is
to
inform
the
client
--
and
this
is
true
of
all
lawyering
--
to
inform
the
client
of
the
legal
risk
of
the
recommended
course
of
action.
and
if
the
law
happens
to
attach
the
most
dramatic
and
severe
consequences
under
a
civil
law,
but
to
attach
them
to
a
conviction,
and
that
consequence
can
only
be
averted
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
i
believe
it
is
the
duty
of
the
criminal
lawyer
to
advise.
but--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
counsel's
responsibility
is
to
ensure
that
he
makes
an
informed
strategic
decision
whether
to
plead
guilty.
that
is
no
business
of
the
court's
and
i
think
that
is
the
distinction.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
first
of
all,
what
you
would
have
to
prove
on
the
competency
prong
is
that
the
misadvice
was
about
an
issue
that
was
material
to
the
strategic
decision
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
at
the
prejudice
prong,
you
would
you
have
to
prove
that
this
defendant
--
and
this
is
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
--
would
have
gone
to
trial.
and
in
order
to
prove
that,
you
have
to
show
that
a
rational
jury
could
have
found
beyond
a
--
could
have
found
reasonable
doubt
as
to
at
least
one
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
in
this
case
it
would
be
knowledge.
and
kentucky
has
a
special
rule
that
does
not
permit
willful
blindness.
you
have
to
show
actual
knowledge
that
it
was
marijuana
in
his
truck.
and
here
you
have
a
commercial
truck
driver
who
was
found
with
styrofoam
boxes
and
wrapped
brown
cardboard
boxes.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
there
was,
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--no,
your
honor.
what
the
officer
testified
--
and
a
key
caveat
here
is
that
all
we
have
is
the
prosecution's
charging
facts
and
the
officer's
testimony
from
the
suppression
hearing.
we
don't
have
the
full
record.
we
don't
have
the
defense
case.
we
don't
have
the
defense
version
of
events.
but
what
he
testified
was
he
was
at
--
the
officer
said,
when
mr.
padilla
was
asked
what
was
in
the
boxes,
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
he
said
"maybe
drugs".
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
exactly.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
these
kinds
of
claims
prejudice
is
generally
going
to
require
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
that
is
why
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
sent
this
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
require
a
mini-trial,
but
that
would
be
in
the
trial
court's
discretion.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
though,
that
this
was
not
an
issue
raised
to
the
state
supreme
court.
and
in
cases
arising
from
state
courts,
this
court
applies
the
same
rule
to
respondents
who
bring
forth
an
alternative
ground
in
support
of
the
judgment
that
it
does
to
petitioners.
it
will
not
reach
a
question
not
passed
on
or
presented
below.
the
only
question
here
is
the
legal
standard.
your
honors,
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
thank
you,
your
honor.
three
quick
points.
in
hill,
the
court
did
expressly
hold
that
strickland
applies
to
the
collateral
consequence
of
parole
eligibility,
so
it
is
not
just
for
--
for
trial
consequences.
and,
secondly,
brady
is
predicated
on
an
assumption
that
there
is
competent
advice
on
a
strategic
decision--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--it
certainly
would
under
the
kentucky
test,
your
honor,
because
it
depends
on
such
factors
as
the
actual
sentence,
the
prior
convictions
of
the
defendant.
those
are
not
things
that
are
known
at
the
pre-colloquy--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--well,
under
rule
11,
at
least
prior
to
the
abolition
of
parole,
there
was
no
advisement
in
the
district
courts
--
the
federal
district
courts
on
that.
the
second
point
is
that
it
is
predicated
on
competency,
and
so
the
standard
is
not
voluntariness
when
you
are
in
the
sixth
amendment,
you
go
to
the
strickland
standard
of
incompetency,
and
then
prejudice
within
the
criminal
prosecution,
i
emphasize
as
what
we
have
here,
the
forfeiture
of
a
jury
trial
right.
we
are
not
talking
about
prejudice
outside
of
the
criminal
prosecution.
and,
finally
--
well,
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
misadvice
rule
has
proven
perfectly
manageable
in
the
30
or
so
jurisdictions
in
which
it
has
been
endorsed.
there
also
have
been
a
handful
of
jurisdictions--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--well,
your
honor,
i
mean,
there
is
--
i
think
that
there
are
something
like
700
claims
over
a
decade
or
something
like
that.
so
we
don't
know,
but
--
there
has
been
no
evidence,
that
we
are
aware
of,
that
the
courts
are
openly
burdened
by
these,
and
even
in
jurisdiction
that
is
apply
the
broader
rule,
we,
again,
are
not
aware
of
any
flood
of
mini-trials.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
your
honor,
i
think
those
would
be
adjudicated
under
strickland,
and,
remember,
strickland--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--yes.
under
the
broader
rule,
you
would
have
a
strickland
claim.
it
would
be
very
hard
to
prevail
on
that
because
you
would
have
to
show
that
it
was
unreasonable
for
him
not
to
investigate
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--he
has
to
do
whatever
is
required
by
competent
representation.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
that's
the
limited
standard.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
your
honor,
our
principal
position
is
that
the
court
should
not
draw
lines.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
strickland.
i
would
say,
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
for
example,
with
the
right
to
vote,
the
chances
that
that
is
going
to
be
material
to
a
plea
decision
by
a
defendant,
especially
one
facing
significant
incarceration,
are
probably
almost
nil,
but
this
should
be
left
to
the
--
to
the
traditional
strickland
inquiry
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
thank
you.
