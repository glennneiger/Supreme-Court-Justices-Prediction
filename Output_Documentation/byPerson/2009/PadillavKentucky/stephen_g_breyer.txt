justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why
do
you
have
a
rule?
i
mean,
i
thought
--
i
looked
up
six
cases,
and
they
all
say,
strickland
cases
in
this
court,
that
you
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
now,
what
i
think
is
radical
on
your
part,
but
tell
me
it
isn't,
is
not
what
the
rule
is,
but
that
you
want
one.
i
thought
the
government's
view
normally
was
the
same
as
we
--
what's
the
exact
words
--
did
the
conduct
of
the
lawyer
meet
professional
--
prevailing
professional
norms?
and
then
we
look
to
see,
if
it
did
not,
whether
that
led
to
a
situation
where
he
would
not
have
pleaded
guilty
but
for
the
failure.
okay?
now,
the
world
is
filled
with
42
billion
circumstances.
if
we
agree
with
you,
we
will
have
set
in
motion
the
great
legal
rule
machine.
and
there's
nothing
better
than
lawyers
spitting
off
rules.
and
we
will
be
here
from
now
until
--
good,
we
won't
have
any
docket
problem,
because
what
we'll
be
doing
is
reviewing
rule
after
rule
after
rule
after
rule.
so
why
has
the
government,
i
think
for
the
first
time,
maybe
not,
told
us
to
abandon
strickland's
approach
and
start
spinning
off
rules?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
it's
easy
--
i
mean,
you
know,
one
thing
we
are
very
good
at
here
is
making
up
hypotheticals.
so
i
imagine
it
wouldn't
be
that
tough
for
me
to
think
of
a
hypothetical
where
everyone
knows
this
90-year-old
individual
who
has
actually
never
set
foot
in
the
country
that
he
came
from,
and
everyone
knows
that
if
he
pleads
guilty
to
this
chewing
gum
offense
where
they
have
virtually
no
evidence,
he
will
be
sent
back,
at
age
90,
to
that
country.
i
would
say
any
lawyer
would
say,
be
careful,
because
if
we
plead
guilty,
back
you
go,
on
the
stretcher
since
you
can
no
longer
walk.
see,
all
i
did
was
spin
out
a
hypothetical.
and
the
reason
i
can
spin
those
out
and
why
we
have
the
strickland
rule
is
pretty
clearly
that
you
shouldn't
have
sub
rules
here
because
life
is
more
complicated
than
rules
tell
us.
just
look
to
see
prevailing
norm
and
did
it
cause
the
harm.
and
that's
why
i
am
back
to
my
question:
isn't
this
the
first
time
the
government
has
asked
us
to
adopt
rules
under
strickland
rather
than
what
it
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
"case
by
case",
underlined,
italics,
repeated
in
the
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
they
are
not
asking
us
to
have
a
rule.
what
he
is
saying
is,
look
to
the
individual
case
and
ask
in
this
case,
did
the
--
at
least
that's
what
i
heard
him;
he's
in
charge
of
his
own
case.
but
i
heard
him
say,
look
to
this
case,
and
in
this
case
it
falls
below
prevailing
norms
for
a
lot
of
reasons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
a
--
a
client
comes
in.
you
are
a
criminal
lawyer
and
you
learn
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
it
turns
out
that,
after
listening
to
the
facts,
you
think
he
is
being
charged
with
a
fairly
minor
offense,
a
year
maybe
max,
and
he
tells
you:
you
know,
i
have
a
family
here,
i've
--
i've
--
you
know,
he
tells
you
this
story
where
it
is
quite
apparent
to
you
that
if
he
pleads
guilty
back
he
goes,
where
he
might
be
killed
and
so
might
his
family.
just
sit
there
and
say
nothing?
what
would
you
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
you
do?
i'm
asking
you,
would
you
tell
him?
he
doesn't
know
about
the
immigration
law.
he
thinks
it's
just
a
year.
you
yourself
have
learned
that
he
probably
will
be
killed,
as
will
his
family,
if
he
pleads
guilty.
would
you
tell
him
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
you
would.
and
do
you
think
of
any
--
can
you
think
of
any
decent
lawyer
who
wouldn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
okay.
then
why
have
you
--
in
this
case,
if
they
didn't
tell
him,
why
has
not
such
a
lawyer
failed
to
meet
prevailing
professional
norms
in
my
hypothetical?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
whether
--
you
just
told
me
that
any
lawyer
worth
his
salt
in
my
example
of
course
would
tell
the
client,
and
--
in
my
case.
and
so
i
just
asked,
then
has
a
lawyer
who
has
failed
to
do
so
not
met
the
prevailing
professional
norm?
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
ethics
or
not
ethics;
it's
how
lawyers
behave.
i
don't
see
how
you
avoid
answering
that
question
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
just
told
me
everyone
would
do
it,
everybody'd
do
it.
i
don't
know
what
a
norm
is
otherwise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
we
get
to
the
misadvice,
to
put
every
--
dot
every
i,
every
lawyer
would
do
it
in
my
case;
that's
a
professional
norm.
if
a
lawyer
fails
to
do
it,
he
hasn't
met
the
professional
norm.
and
a
rule
that's
absolute
would
overturn
strickland
in
that
respect,
because
strickland
says
if
you
fail
to
meet
professional
norms
you
are
guilty
of
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel,
okay?
so
q.e.d.
now
what
is
wrong
with
what
i
just
said?
