mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
hill
v.
lockhart
this
court
again
focused
on
voluntariness
and
said
that
voluntariness
of
the
plea
depends
on
counsel's
advice
and
whether
that
counsel
advice
is
in
the
range
of
competence
of
the
attorneys
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
again,
the
focus
was
on
voluntary.
and
in
brady,
this
court
described
a
voluntary
plea
as
"a
plea
entered
by
one
possessing
full
knowledge
of
direct
consequences.
"
thus,
reading
the
cases
together,
it
would
appear
that
the
defendant
need
to
have
only
knowledge
--
full
knowledge
of
direct
consequences,
and
advice
of
counsel
is
just
a
tool
to
ensure
that.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
well,
i
think
under
this
court's
precedent
the
informed
right
is
to
know
what
those
rights
are,
what
is
the
weight
of
the
evidence
against
you,
and
to
make
those
strategic
decisions.
but
that--
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
--well,
we
are
not
particularly
ignoring
it.
we
are
saying
ultimately
under
the
sixth
amendment
what
is
prudent
or
appropriate
may
not
necessarily
be
what
the
inquiry
is,
but
what
is
constitutional
mandated.
and
what
is
constitutionally
mandated
here
is
to
provide
the
adversary
to
waive
the
--
put
the
commonwealth's
or
the
state's
proof
--
to
weigh
it,
to
advise
about
it.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
well,
the
calculus
may
change
ever
so
slightly,
but
i
think
the
difference
is,
is
that
mis-advice
is
still
--
is
not
materially
different
than
the
failure
to
advise.
ultimately
the
--
the
defendant
still
is
left
to
operate
under
a
misapprehension.
and
the
states
are
more
than
able
to
police
this
kind
of
conduct
and
in
fact
the
states
have.
i
think
it's
approximately
27
states
that
do
add
to
their,
quote,
unquote,
11>
["]
and
--
and
require
some
sort
of
inquiry
by
--
by
the
courts.
and
ultimately,
it's
the
states
or
the
individual
courts
through
their
rulemaking
process
or
through
legislative
prerogative
whereby
this
could
better,
best
be
addressed,
rather
than
constitutionalizing
mis-advice
and
trying
to
draw
this
really
hard
distinction
between
no
duty
and
the
duty
to
advise.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
your
honor,
my
--
my
personal
--
personal
obligation
at
that
point
would
be
to
try
to
answer
the
question.
but
again--
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
--if
i
possessed
that
knowledge,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
no,
your
honor.
but--
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
first
of
all,
the
prevailing
professional
norm
or
ethical
obligations
that
have
been
enacted
in
kentucky
and
in
most
states
provide
very
general
obligations
and
they
do
not
actually
speak
to
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessarily
a
prevailing
norm.
it's
a
question
of--
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
--pardon
me,
but
it's
a
question
of
morals
here
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
offer
that
advice.
now--
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
and
in
fact
it's
really
unclear
what
advice
was
given
because,
as
my
opponent
has
mentioned,
there
was
not
an
evidentiary
hearing,
so
what
was
actually
said
is
unclear.
but
i
feel
like
the
--
that
mis-advice
distinction
made
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
does--
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
disagree
a
little
bit.
i
believe
strickland
is
not
quite
that
expansive.
strickland
talks
with
regard
to
professional
norms
and
ethical
standards
as
guides
in
determining
competent
counsel,
and
does
not
set
them
as
hard,
fast
rules.
and
in--
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
correct.
and
under
strickland
--
under
the
sixth
amendment,
criminal
defense
attorneys
must
focus
on
issues
of
guilt
and
innocence
and
penalty.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
our
point
would
be
not
be
fully
informed
about
every
possible
consequence
which
would
be
in
--
in--
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
that's
kind
of
the
problem,
i
believe.
the
cases
that
--
that
do
address
this
issue
seem
to
focus
on
voluntariness
and
they
focus
upon
the
definition
this
court
espoused
in
brady,
and
they
uniformly
come
up
with
the
--
with
the
conclusion
that
no
affirmative
duty
is
required.
they
then
jump
from
that
position
to
a
--
to
a
position
where
misadvice
somehow
changes
the
inquiry.
they
fail
to
focus
again
on
voluntary,
where
--
meaning
full
knowledge
of
direct
consequences,
and
instead
reached
out
to
these
kind
of
results-driven
opinions
that
are
kind
of
fueled
by
this
feeling
of
--
of
unfairness.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
you're
--
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
and
again,
that
silence
has
then
led
the
circuits
to
develop
a
rule.
and
the
predominant
rule
is
that
a
voluntary
plea
following
this
court's
other
decisions
which
it
has
--
where
it
has
spoken,
that
the
plea
need
only
be
entered
by
one
possessing
full
knowledge
of
direct
consequences.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
well,
following
the
logic
of
the
circuits
and
of
this
court's
guidance
in
brady,
again,
the
inquiry
for
voluntariness
is
on
direct
consequences,
so
it
would
not
rise
to
the
sixth
amendment
claim.
counsel
may,
nonetheless,
may
be
--
i'm
not
a
very
good
counsel
in
that
situation.
however,
as
it
was
pointed
out
earlier,
sometimes,
criminal
defendants
risk
ordinary
error
with
their
representation,
and
in
fact,
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
numerous
cases.
in
u.s.
v.
ruiz,
this
court
kind
of
compiled
a
group
of
cases,
including
brady,
mcmann,
and
tollett,
in
which
the
defendant
did,
in
fact,
operate
under
misapprehension
with
regard
to
the
things
that
we
most
often
consider
strategic,
more
direct
obligations
of
the
trial.
they
--
i
think,
in
brady,
they
misapprehended
the
quality
of
the
evidence
and
the
penalties
and
such,
and
this
court
ultimately
found
that,
in
all
those
cases,
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
ordinary
error
that
is
at
risk
when
you
are
pleading
guilty,
that
you
risk
a
certain
amount
of
--
that
your
counsel
may
not
have
made
the
best
strategic
decision.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
fine
line,
that
it
would
technically
be
a
collateral
consequence
under
the
classic
definition
of
collateral
consequence,
that
being
whether
or
not
it
falls
under
the
control
or
discretion
of
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
the
popular
definition
--
or
the
most
common
definition
focuses
on
whether
it
falls
under
the
discretion
or
power
of
the
sentencing
court.
in
those
jurisdictions
that
have
sexual
offender
registries,
it
is
not
a
--
something
that
is
discretionary
with
the
court.
it
is
through
the
executive
agency
that
that
is
enforced,
just
like
parole,
also
just
like
your
right
--
to
lose
your
right
to
vote
--
losing
your
right
to
bear
arms.
all
of
those
things
happen
automatically
by
action
of
law,
yet
they
remain
collateral
because
they
do
not
fall
under
--
with
--
under
the
discretion
and
power
of
the
sentencing
court.
if
i
could
remind
you
all
--
i
apologize
for
putting
"you
all"
--
but
--
my
being
from
kentucky
is
showing
a
little.
[laughter]
the
modern
rules
of
professional
conduct
are
very,
very
broad,
and
there's
--
i
don't
believe
that
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
they
were
actually
violated
here,
even
under
the
alleged
conduct,
the
prevailing
norms
that
the
aba
puts
forth
in
its
brief
or
the
criminal
justice
standards
are
aspirational.
they
--
they
focus
more
on
what--
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
--i
said
--
in
response
to
justice
breyer,
in
the
extreme
circumstances,
again,
it
would
be
my
opinion
--
not
necessarily
the
opinion
of
this
court
or
necessarily
would
fall
under
the
sixth
amendment,
but
that,
if
you
absolutely
knew
and
that
a
--
a
severe
collateral
consequence
is
of
great
importance,
you
should
explore
it.
the
misadvice
rule
that
the
u.s.
government
kind
of
puts
forth
as
the
hybrid
position,
it
does
--
i
do
believe
creates
these
collateral
consequences
as
land
mines
to
be
avoided.
i
think
it
does,
in
fact,
encourage
criminal
defendants
to
be
--
or
criminal
defense
attorneys
to
be
silent
in
situations
where
they
would,
otherwise,
be
more
free
in
offering
that
advice.
and,
again,
offering
the
advice
does
not
necessarily
raise
it
to
sixth
amendment
purview
because,
again,
there
are
any
number
of
things
that
are
going
to
come
up
in
that
attorney-client
relationship.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
well,
i
think,
in
this
case,
we
are
focusing
on
the
obligation
created
by
the
sixth
amendment,
and
the
sixth
amendment
obligation
refers
to
the
criminal
proceeding
and
the
criminal
prosecution
and
then
to
aid
in
the
defense.
like
the
--
and
we
would
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
there,
that
the
purpose
for
the
criminal
attorney
in
that
situation
is
to
counteract
the
expert
of
the
commonwealth
or
the
state.
it
is
to
ensure
the
fair
and
just
determination
of
guilt,
not
to
advise
on
collateral
matters,
such
as
deportation,
child
custody,
and
the
like.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
well,
ultimately,
in
this
court,
it
did
not
--
it
didn't
draw
any
line.
it
was
silent
on
that
point,
and
given
the
way
the
lower
courts
have
reacted
in
drawing
the
direct
and
collateral
line,
i
think
that's
kind
of
where
we
have
to
go.
that
is
what
the
rule
is
of
the
lower
courts
and
as
the
rule
has
--
has
been
applied
throughout
the
nation,
and
we
are
testing
whether
or
not
that
rule
makes
sense,
essentially.
and
i
think,
ultimately,
there
is
a
potential
problem
in
treating
deportation
differently
than
other
collateral
consequences.
to
do
so,
i
believe,
at
one
point
in
mr.
kinnaird's
argument,
he
does
make
the
point
that
deportation,
because
it
is
of
such
importance
or
that
--
that
it
should
be
treated
differently.
but
that
is
to
suggest
that
it's
so
important
in
all
situations
and
it
is
more
important
than
collateral
consequence
that
may
affect
citizens.
citizens
will
lose
the
right
to
vote.
they
will
lose
their
right
to
jury
service,
perhaps
lose
custody
of
their
children.
and
there
is
no
principled
reason
to
really
treat
deportation
differently.
if
the
reason
to
treat
it
differently
because
it
is
viewed
as
so
severe,
it's
truly
been
a
subjective
inquiry
as
what
collateral
consequence
is
severe
to
this
client.
and
it
ultimately
prefers
a
class
of
citizens
--
those
who
are
non-citizens
--
over
citizens
who
may
have
just
as
much
important
place
on
collateral
consequences
they
face.
moving
real
quickly,
if
i
could
just
touch
briefly
on
the
prejudice
prong
of
strickland.
first,
i'm
not
--
well,
i
hesitate
to
say
this
a
little
bit,
but
it's
not
completely
apparent
on
the
record
that
counsel's
performance
was,
in
fact,
deficient.
he
did
not
misadvise
with
regard
to
any
direct
consequence.
padilla
does
not
allege
that
he
misunderstood
any
of
the
rights
he
was
waiving
and
at
least
--
and
up
until
his
reply
brief,
made
no
bones
about
the
fact
that
he
was
guilty.
and,
in
fact,
that
solemn
and
sworn
admission
of
guilt
should
not
be
lightly
undone.
mr.
wm.
robert
long
jr.
well,
your
honor,
again,
that
is
a
risk
that
is
taken
when
asking
questions
of
your
counsel.
it
would
not
necessarily
fall
under
the
sixth
amendment
requirements.
