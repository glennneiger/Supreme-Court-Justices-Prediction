chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-651,
padilla
v.
kentucky.
mr.
kinnaird.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
other
advice,
for
example
advice
about
whether
to
take
the
stand,
that
can
have
significant
collateral
consequences
--
you
know,
he
might
lose
his
job
or
lose
government
contracts
based
on
what
he
says.
is
that
the
sort
of
advice
that
would
be
covered
in
--
under
your
position?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
only
plead
guilty?
not,
for
example,
whether
it
would
be
material
to
the
defendant
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
take
the
stand?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
suppose
--
before
a
guilty
plea
is
accepted
the
district
court
judge
is
obligated
to
go
through
a
colloquy
to
make
sure
the
defendant
knows
the
consequences
of
accepting
the
plea.
i
would
suppose
if
you
prevail
that
that
colloquy
would
have
to
be
expanded
to
include
something
like:
do
you
understand
the
deportation
consequences,
if
any,
of
pleading
guilty?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
that's
--
i
don't
see
why
that
doesn't
apply
to
the
more
fundamental
question
about
whether
the
district
court
has
to
inquire
into
the
plea
circumstances
in
any
event.
i
thought
--
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
that,
oh,
well,
all
sorts
of
things
can
come
up
at
trial
and
the
district
judge
doesn't
have
to
inquire
into
those,
i
think
proves
too
much.
it
goes
to
--
and
it
departs
from
your
focus
on
the
guilty
plea.
that's
all
the
judge
is
inquiring
about.
and
i
don't
know
why
that
obligation
doesn't
extend
to
a
fundamental
piece
of
information
that
would
--
that
would
under
your
theory
make
acceptance
of
the
plea
involuntary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
what
you
are
saying
is
he
has
got
to
tell
him
all
the
stuff
that
is
necessary
to
make
the
decision
to
accept
the
plea
knowing
and
intelligent,
voluntary.
and
i
thought
that
was
pretty
much
what
the
district
court
was
doing
when
they
have
the
colloquy.
that
district
judge
wants
to
make
sure
the
defendant
knows
what
he
is
agreeing
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
and
also
drug
paraphernalia
in
the
cab.
and
was
there
some
marijuana
in
the
cab,
too?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
point
is
an
important
one.
we
don't
have
the
defense
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
have
the
prosecution
case
either.
you
don't
know
exactly
what
witnesses
they
are
going
to
call,
what
the
strength
of
it
is.
so
you
don't
know
whether
there
is
going
to
be
prejudice
or
not.
when
you
see
--
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
make
quite
a
prediction
about
what
the
case
is
going
to
look
like
to
decide
if
there
is
prejudice,
to
decide
if
the
fellow's
going
to
take
the
plea
or
not.
and
i'm
just
wondering
how
you
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
--
it's
going
to
require,
i
guess,
kind
of
a
mini-trial
to
decide
if
the
person
would
have
taken
the
plea,
you've
got
to
know
what
the
case
--
his
case
looked
like,
what
the
prosecutor's
case
looked
like,
to
see
if
it's
something
he
would
have
made
--
that
would
have
made
sense
for
him
to
go
to
trial
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben,
we
learn
in
the
first
year
of
law
school
that
the
line
between
an
affirmative
act
and
failure
to
act
is
a
difficult
one
to
draw.
what
if
the
lawyer
says,
you're
going
to
face
5
years,
and
the
defendant
says,
is
that
all
that's
going
to
happen
to
me?
and
the
lawyer
says
yes.
is
that
a
failure
to
advise
or
is
that
an
affirmative
misrepresentation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
when
we
--
when
we
decide
there's
no
right
to
counsel,
like
on
collateral
review,
we
don't
even
look
at
what
happened,
right?
we
don't
look
and
see
whether
the
advice
was
ineffective,
how
bad
the
lawyer
was.
the
idea
is
if
you
don't
have
the
right
at
all,
you
don't
have
the
right
to
an
effective
lawyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
right?
okay.
well,
these
--
when
you
are
talking
about
collateral
consequences,
you
don't
have
a
right
to
counsel
on
--
with
respect
to
those
collateral
consequences.
i
assume
there's
--
maybe
there
is
--
is
there
a
right
to
counsel
when
you
are
facing
a
deportation
proceeding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then,
if
there
is
no
right
to
counsel,
why
do
we
get
into
whether
there
is
an
affirmative
misrepresentation
or
not?
just
like
in
a
collateral
--
habeas
context,
we
don't
care
whether
there
is
an
affirmative
misreputation
--
misrepresentation,
because
there
is
no
right
to
counsel
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
the
defendant,
but
a
defendant?
in
other
words,
i
assume
it's
an
objective
inquiry
you
would
make
rather
than
a
subjective
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
assume,
for
example,
that
someone
who
is
going
to
lose
the
custody
of
their
children
would
regard
that
as
important.
you
don't
want
testimony
about
this
guy
doesn't
care
about
the
children,
so
it's
not
a
big
deal
to
him.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
won't
--
won't
your
test
result
in
a
net
loss
to
defendants?
i
assume
if
this
is
adopted
as
a
rule,
the
affirmative
misrepresentation
rule,
then
every
lawyer
is
going
to
say
what
you
said
they
should
say:
i'm
here
for
the
criminal
case;
i'm
not
telling
you
anything
about
anything
else,
as
opposed
to
saying,
sitting
down
and
saying:
here's
what
you
need
to
know.
and
in
most
cases
we
expect
the
lawyer
to
do
a
professional
job.
if
you
have
got
an
alien,
he
is
going
to
tell
him:
well,
what
--
you
know,
this
will
cause
you
to
be
deported.
instead,
every
lawyer
now
is
going
to
say:
i'm
not
giving
you
any
advice
about
anything
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
long.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
told
justice
breyer
that
any
good
lawyer
would
give
this
advice
to
a
client?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kinnaird,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
is
your
answer
to
the
situation
that
i
think
has
been
hypothesized
of
the
lawyer
--
the
defendant
asks
him,
what
are
the
deportation
consequences?
and
the
lawyer
says,
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
a
deportation
lawyer.
i'm
a
criminal
lawyer,
but
my
best
guess
is
that
you
are
all
right.
what
happens
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
can
make
a
claim
when
the
lawyer
disavows
the
knowledge
on
the
question?
in
other
words,
he
is
trying
to
be
helpful,
but
he
also
warns
the
defendant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"to
investigate"?
so
even
if
he
doesn't
know
deportation
and
the
client
asks
him,
he
has
to
investigate
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-651,
padilla
versus
kennedy.
