mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
petitioner's
claim
that
defense
counsel
has
a
duty
to
advise
his
client
about
all
of
the
myriad
collateral
consequences
that
may
stem
from
a
criminal
conviction,
which
the
government
does
not
think
that
a
defense
counsel
has
under
the
sixth
amendment,
and
the
claim
that
is
focused
more
precisely
on
mis-advice
given
by
defense
counsel
on
a
material
collateral
consequence
to
a
defendant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
it's
certainly
not
an
affirmative
misrepresentation.
in
context,
what
the
defense
lawyer's
purpose
is
is
to
counter
the
government's
criminal
case.
that
is
what
the
sixth
amendment
provides
a
lawyer
to
do.
a
government
appears
through
its
expert
adversary.
the
sixth
amendment
provides
a
counterweight
to
that
in
the
form
of
a
lawyer
to
deal
with
the
criminal
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
we
think,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
defense
lawyer
has
two
relevant
duties
here.
one
is
to
counter
the
government's
case,
which
means
to
provide
advice
to
the
defendant
about
his
rights,
the
nature
of
the
charges,
the
evidence,
and
the
affirmative
defenses
that
may
exist.
and
that
is
a
task
that
is
somewhat
broader
than
the
court
has
in
conducting
a
rule
11
colloquy.
the
court
does
not
go
into
strategic
matters
in
a
criminal
case
with
the
defendant.
defense
counsel
must.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
certainly
not
by
virtue--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--of
the
sixth
amendment,
mr.
chief
justice.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it's
because
the
lawyer
has
an
additional
duty
in
the
context
of
advising
his
client
whether
to
take
a
guilty
plea,
and
that
is
the
duty
to
respect
that
the
decision
whether
to
plead
guilty
belongs
to
the
defendant
personally.
it's
not
a
decision
that
can
be
exercised
by
proxy
by
the
lawyer.
and
the
lawyer's
duty
to
respect
that,
whatever
advice
he
gives,
the
defendant
must
be
able
to
make
his
own
personal
decision,
imposes
a
concomitant
duty
not
to
interfere
with
or
undermine
the
defendant's
ability
to
make
an
intelligent
decision
with
the
information
he
has.
so
if
a
lawyer
chooses
when
asked
about
collateral
consequences,
as
many
aliens
will
do:
will
i
get
deported?
the
lawyer
is
perfectly
free
to
say:
i
am
not
your
immigration
counsel.
you
need
a
lawyer
to
advise
you
about
immigration.
i
am
your
criminal
lawyer.
and
that's
perfectly
fine.
but
if
a
lawyer
goes
beyond
that
and
says:
don't
worry
about
it.
you've
been
in
the
country
so
long,
you
are
not
going
to
get
deported,
with
the
understanding
and
the
backdrop
that
this
is
an
important
factor
in
whether
this
defendant
is
going
to
decide
to
take
a
guilty
plea
or
to
go
to
trial,
then
the
lawyer
has
used
his
professional
skills
to
undermine
a
personal
decision
that
belongs
to
the
defendant
alone.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would
put
them,
justice
scalia,
all
in
the
same
general
basket,
which
is
to
say,
mis-advice
on
a
legal
matter
of
importance
to
the
defendant
that
could
skew
his
decision
to
plead
guilty
may
be
deficient
representation
under
strickland.
i
think
what--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
objective
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
actually
think
that
would
be
quite
relevant,
because
if
any
mis-advice
did
not
cause
the
defendant
to
plead
guilty
because
it
was
irrelevant
to
him,
then
the
defendant
should
not
be
able
to
get
in
the
door
with
an
ineffective
assistance
claim.
and
i
also
think
if
the
defendant
hasn't
manifested
in
some
way
that
the
particular
collateral
consequence
is
important
to
that
defendant,
then
the
lawyer
certainly
has
no
obligation
even
under
professional
standards--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
don't
think
that
it
will
lead
to
sort
of
defensive
malpractice
type
of
counseling
where
lawyers
do
not
do
the
job
that
they
feel
that
they
should
do,
and
experience
tends
to
support
that.
the
rule
right
now
in
ten
federal
circuits
is
there
is
no
duty
to
advise
about
collateral
consequences.
seven
federal
circuits
have
a
rule
that
affirmative
mis-advice
about
collateral
consequences
can
support
a
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
we
have
not
abandoned
strickland's
approach.
what
we
have
focused
on
is,
what
is
the
sixth
amendment
right
in
the
first
place?
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
not
a
right
to
have
a
state-provided
lawyer
who
will
advise
you
about
child
custody
or
about
deportation
or
about--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the
fundamental
point
is
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
court
has
been
asked
to
adopt
a
rule
under
strickland
that
would
require
a
lawyer
pursuant
to
sixth
amendment
norms
to
give
advice
that
pertains--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
breyer,
the
--
the
lower
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
i
think
have
correctly
recognized
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
saying
that
strickland
is
a
case-by-case
inquiry
into
lawyer
competence
and
saying
that
strickland
requires
the
lawyer
to
provide
advice
about
collateral
consequences
that
are
not
the
criminal--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
alito,
i
don't
think
that
he
has
a
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
a
lawyer
who
will
counsel
him
about
the
potential
immigration
consequences
of
a
guilty
plea.
that
is
not
what
the
sixth
amendment
was
designed
for.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
know
that
anything
happens
to
the
lawyer,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is
a
professional
incentive
to
provide
advice
where
you
are
competent
to
provide
advice
and
not
to
provide
it
where
you
are
not
competent.
and
i
think
that
the
focus
on
immigration
consequences
illustrates
two
things:
one
is
this
is
an
extraordinarily
complicated
area
of
the
law,
where
it
is
very
difficult
to
give
advice.
and
for
a
lawyer
to
be
expected
to
master
not
only
the
criminal
aspects
of
the
case
but
also
the
immigration
aspects
of
the
case
will
only
tend
to
divert
attention
from
what
the
lawyer
is
really
there
to
do,
advise--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
former
part
is
certainly
something
that
the
court
could
in
its
rulemaking
capacity
do.
the
latter
part
is
a
sixth
amendment
question.
and
i
think
it's
highly
notable
that
the
rules
committee
for
the
criminal
rules
has
twice
considered
whether
to
amend
rule
11
and
is
going
to
consider
it
again
contemporaneously
with
this
case,
to
require
the
judge
to
say
to
an
alien
defendant,
you
may
want
to
take
into
account
removal
consequences
of
a
criminal
conviction.
in
other
words,
there
are
rule-based
ways
to
address
some
of
the
concerns
that
justice
alito
raised
without
constitutionalizing
a
new
area
of
collateral
consequences
that
would
impose
new
duties
that
actually
would
divert
the
lawyer
from
his
criminal
law
function,
whereas
the
mis-advice
line
has
not
created
those
problems.
and
as
i
started
to
say
earlier,
the
fact
that
ten
federal
circuits
have
said
no
duty
to
advise
on
collateral
consequences
while
seven
have
recognized
that
mis-advice
on
collateral
consequences
can
provide
relief,
has
not
led
to
a
series
of
difficult
strickland
hearings
that
are
unmanageable.
justice
alito--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--then
the
client
does
not
get
relief
for
two
reasons.
one
is
because
we
believe
there
is
no
duty
to
give
that
advice.
but
even
if
the
court
disagreed
with
me
on
that,
such
a
defendant
could
hardly
show
prejudice
because
he
knew
that
he
went
into
his
guilty
plea
with
an
uncertainty,
at
best,
about
removal.
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
show
what
he
should
have
to
show
to
establish
prejudice:
first,
that
subjectively
he
would
not
have
pleaded
guilty
had
he
been
given
correct
immigration
advice;
and
second,
that
a
reasonable
defendant
would
have
had
a
basis
not
to
plead
guilty,
because
if
the
defendant
is
going
to
be
convicted
after
a
trial
in
any
event
the
same
collateral
consequence
is
going
to
ensue.
the
defendant
will
not
evade
the
collateral
consequences
of
removal
if
the
defendant
was
going
to
be
convicted
at
a
trial
anyway.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
courts
will
evaluate
that
kind
of
a
claim
just
the
way
they
evaluate
any
other
strickland
claim
and
decide
whether
there
was
any
reasonable
probability
that
such
a
defense
could
have
prevailed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
is
the
typical
regime
that
the
court
has
dictated
under
strickland,
and
it
has
not
proved
unmanageable
in
the
courts
that
have
adopted
the
limited
mis-advice
rule
that
the
government
supports.
