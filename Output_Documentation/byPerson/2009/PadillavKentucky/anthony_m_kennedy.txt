justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
were
in,
if
we
were
in
the
contract,
civil
contract
situation,
and
there
was
a
mistake,
the
usual
rule,
restatement
of
contracts,
is
that
the
--
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable
to
have
the
party
who
made
the
mistake
bear
the
risk.
suppose
we
just
had
an
instruction,
rule
11?
i
recognize
this
is
a
state
case,
but
we
had
a
rule
11
instruction,
which
said
the
only
thing
the
court
is
going
to
inquire
about
and
the
only
thing
that
is
of
relevance
to
your
plea
are
criminal
consequences.
you
take
the
risk
of
any
mis-advice,
any
misunderstanding,
with
respect
to
collateral
conduct.
that's
your
risk,
and
it's
part
of
the
guilty
plea.
if
we
said
that,
would
that
foreclose
this
kind
of
argument
in
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
there
is
no
way
the
government
or
the
court
can
protect
itself
against
the
--
these
consequences,
and
there
are
any
number
of
them.
suppose
he
doesn't
advise
that
there
is
going
to
be
civil
liability
in
tort
once
he
pleads
guilty,
because
then
that's
a
fact
that's
concluded
and
it's
just
a
question
of
damages.
and
as
justice
scalia
indicated,
there
are
many,
many
instances.
i
just
see
no
way
for
the
courts
to
protect
themselves
against
--
against
this.
if
the
client,
the
accused,
is
told
that
he
accepts
these
risks,
he
can
say,
well,
you
know,
there
may
be
some
risks
i
don't
know
about,
i'll
go
to
trial.
he
just
accepts
the
risks.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
it
would
be
wrong
for
a
district
court
to
say,
i
want
to
be
very
careful
and
i'm
going
to
add
--
let's
take
rule
11
as
the
standard.
it's
a
federal
case.
i'm
going
to
add
to
rule
11.
i'm
going
to
say,
in
addition
to
the
rule
11
questions
that
you've
all
answered,
i
want
to
make
sure:
have
you
been
advised
about
immigration?
have
you
been
advised
about
other
collateral
--
do
you
think
that
would
be
error
or
inappropriate
for
a
district
judge
to
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
judge
would
not
be
exceeding
his
--
his
commission,
his
authority,
to
determine
just
whether
this
is
knowing
and
voluntary
in
the
sense
of
knowing
--
knowing
the
criminal
consequences
in
the
criminal
system
itself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
a
careful
district
judge
would
have
to
do
this
if
you
prevail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you
are
saying
that
the
more
the
defense
counsel
strays
from
his
only
professional
responsibility,
the
more
at
risk
the
government
is.
that
seems
odd.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
shouldn't
we
just
adopt
an
amendment
to
rule
11
in
which
the
judge
says,
any
collateral
consequences
with
respect
to
your
plea
are
not
the
concern
of
this
court
and
will
not
be
grounds
for
setting
aside
this
--
this
--
this
plea?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
everyone
at
the
counsel
table
i
assume
agrees
that
the
plea
has
to
be
voluntary.
but
voluntary
has
various
meanings:
number
one
it
is
not
coerced
or
forced.
would
--
isn't
your
argument
that
voluntary
does
not
include
being
fully
informed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
about
important
collateral
consequences.
are
there
--
are
there
any
cases
that
address
this
point
one
way
or
the
other?
that
is
to
say,
the
extent
to
which
voluntary
includes
the
component
of
being
informed
about
major
consequences,
significant
consequences
of
the
plea?
can
i
go
anywhere
to
read
a
discussion
of
this?
