justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
a
plea
is
something
more
than:
i'm
guilty.
it
is
a
strategic
decision
not
to
put
the
government
to
its
burden
of
proof.
your
definition
of
voluntariness
suggests
that
there
is
only
one
component
to
it,
do
i
know
what
my
rights
are,
as
opposed
to,
do
i
know
what
they
are
and
making
an
informed
decision
to
waive
those
rights.
your
articulation
of
the
rule
leaves
out
the
second
component:
am
i
making
an
informed
decision
to
waive
those
rights?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
how
do
you
do
that?
i
mean,
your
adversary's
argument
is
in
their
particular
case
--
and
i
know
that
you
dispute
this
--
there
is
a
defense
that
could
win
at
trial.
and
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says:
okay,
what
are
my
choices?
i
go
to
trial
and
i
may
serve
a
longer
sentence,
but
i
don't
go
to
trial,
i
may
serve
that
--
i
do
go
to
trial
and
i
serve
that
longer
sentence,
but
it's
here
in
the
u.s.
and
not
in
my
home
country,
where
i
might
starve
to
death.
i
think
i
will
stay
here
and
take
that
risk.
you're
--
you're
sort
of
ignoring
that
component
of
information
in
terms
of
informing
the
strategic
choice
of
whether
to
take
the
risk
and
go
to
trial.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
then
that
goes
to
the
solicitor
general's
position,
which
is:
you
may
be
right,
an
attorney
doesn't
have
to
give
more
information
than
what's
necessary,
but
doesn't
the
calculus
change
when
the
defendant
says,
this
is
important
to
me;
give
me
accurate
advice,
if
you
are
going
to
give
me
advice?
