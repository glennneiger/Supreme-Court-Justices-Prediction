justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
can't
leave
that
for
another
day.
i
mean,
we
--
we
have
to
decide
whether
we
are
opening
a
pandora's
box
here,
whether
there
is
any
sensible
way
to
restrict
it
to
--
to
deportation.
what
about
advice
on
whether
pleading
guilty
would
--
would
cause
him
to
lose
custody
of
his
children?
that's
--
that's
pretty
serious.
what
if
pleading
guilty
will
--
will
affect
whether
he
can
keep
his
truck,
which
is
his
main
means
of
livelihood,
or
whether
--
whether
it
would
be
seized
by
the
government
as
the
instrument
of
his
crime?
there
are
so
many
pieces
of
advice
which
involve
legal
issues
that
--
that
counsel
can
provide
advice
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
--
that's
--
with
due
respect,
that's
ridiculous.
if
it's
important
enough
to
be
required
to
be
told
to
the
defendant
by
his
counsel,
surely
it's
important
enough
to
be
advised
to
the
defendant
by
the
court
before
the
guilty
plea
is
accepted
as
voluntary,
which
includes
knowing
--
knowing
the
consequences.
it's
a
very
strange
line
you
draw
between
what
we
are
going
to
hold
counsel
to
and
what
we
are
going
to
require
the
defendant
to
be
advised
of
by
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
that
the
duty
of
the
criminal
lawyer
is
to
make
sure
that
the
defendant's
guilty
plea
is
informed,
it
is
an
informed
guilty
plea.
that
is
the
same
obligation
of
the
court
in
the
colloquy,
to
be
sure
that
it's
an
informed
plea.
and
if
you
say
it's
uninformed
for
counsel
not
to
go
into
the
myriad
collateral
consequences,
then
i
assume
it's
--
it's
--
it's
improper
for
the
court
not
to
go
into
those
consequences.
they
both
pertain
to
whether
the
guilty
plea
is
informed.
that's
counsel's
responsibility.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
he
was
asked
what
was
in
the
--
what
was
in
the
containers
and
he
said
marijuana.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
about
mis-advice
as
to
whether
he
will
lose
custody
of
his
children,
or
mis-advice
as
to
whether
his
truck
which
he
owns
will
be
confiscated
by
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
consequences
to
the
lawyer?
i
mean,
let's
assume
you
are
a
public
defender,
and
you
are
confronted
with
this
situation.
is
it
--
how
--
how
much
skin
is
it
off
your
teeth
if
you
provide
the
advice,
even
though
you
are
uncertain,
and
the
advice
turns
out
to
be
wrong?
what
happens
to
the
lawyer?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
what
incentive
is
there
to
withhold
uncertain
advice?
is
there
any
incentive
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
your
client
will
get
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
will
make
a
guilty
plea
and
afterwards
it
will
be
set
aside.
justice
antonin
scalia
after
--
after
a
mini-trial,
which
deprives
the
government
of
--
of
its
whole
benefit
from
the
guilty
plea.
governments
accept
guilty
pleas
in
order
to
avoid
the
time
and
expense
of
going
to
--
to
a
trial.
and
here
you
have
to
go
back
and
find
out
what
the
evidence
would
have
been,
so
that
the
court
can
make
the
decision
you
say
is
so
easy.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
assuming
it's
a
norm
and
that
all
lawyers
do
it,
including
those
that
know
diddly
about
immigration
law,
the
norm
is
to
give
bad
advice.
and
here
--
here
the
norm
was
met,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
point
is
that
--
i
thought
your
point
was
that
--
that
strickland
does
require
professional
norms
to
be
observed,
but
it
is
professional
norms
regarding
advising
a
defendant
as
to
the
trial
consequences
of
his
plea
as
to
those
matters
that
are
involved
in
the
prosecution,
and
not
as
to
collateral
matters.
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
those
are
the
only
norms
that
are
relevant,
what
norms
oblige
counsel
to
advise
a
defendant
regarding
trial
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
not
sure
the
parole
eligibility
could
qualify
as
a
collateral
consequence.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
goes
to
the
sentence.
it
goes
to
what
the
sentence
will
be,
which
is
certainly
part
of
the
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that?
where
there
has
not
been
a
revolution
or
what?
what
--
how
do
you
know?
