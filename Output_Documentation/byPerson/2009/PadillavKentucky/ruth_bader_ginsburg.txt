justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
decide
which
of
the
many
consequences
your
rule
would
cover?
i
mean,
you
are
now
talking
about
a
narrower
ground,
misadvice.
but
you
are
also
urging
that
when
the
lawyer
is
silent
on
a
matter
that
he
should
inform
the
defendant
that,
too,
is
covered.
but
whichever
way
you
do
it,
how
do
you
--
you
say
certainly
deportation
is
a
consequence
that
the
defendant
should
be
told
about.
what
about
--
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from,
say,
you'll
lose
your
driver's
license,
you'll
lose
your
right
to
vote?
how
do
we
distinguish
the
consequences
that
count
and
those
that
don't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even
--
even
if
we
accept
that,
wouldn't
a
competent
counsel,
after
telling
him
the
deportation
consequences,
then
say,
but
this
is
a
case
where
the
evidence
is
so
strong
against
you,
i
advise
you
to
take
the
plea
rather
than
go
to
trial.
if
you
go
to
trial,
you
are
likely
to
lose
and
you
will
get
a
longer
sentence.
so
does
it
matter
in
the
end
if
competent
counsel
would
have
said,
this
is
a
good
plea,
take
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
were
about
to
say
that
in
many
states
the
trial
judge
does
inform
a
defendant
who
is
an
alien
of
immigration
consequences.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
be
what
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
know
that?
in
this
case,
mr.
kinnaird
told
us
the
defendant
might
have
preferred
to
go
to
trial
because
he
had
this
defense
that
he
didn't
know
what
was
in
the
packages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
long,
you
said
that
this
is
a
collateral
consequence.
therefore
the
lawyer
has
no
obligation
to
advise
the
client.
but
what
was
remarkable
about
the
case
that
you
rely
on,
hill
v.
lockwood,
is
the
eighth
circuit
used
the
distinction
between
direct
and
collateral.
in
this
court,
the
opinion
said
nothing
about
direct
or
collateral;
it
just
asks
the
question
under
strickland,
and
it
held
that
strickland
does
apply
to
challenges
to
guilty
pleas
based
on
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
but
it
--
staring
the
court
in
the
face
was
this
direct
versus
collateral,
and
the
court
was
totally
silent
on
that.
it
didn't
consider
it
relevant
to
its
determination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
are
talking
at
a
highly
general
level,
but
what's
facing
us
--
this
case,
is
there
are
certain
crimes
--
an
increased
number
of
crimes
that
are
classified
as
aggravated
felonies,
where
the
rule
is,
if
you
are
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony,
you
are
out
of
the
country
after
you
serve
your
time.
there
is
nothing
mysterious
about
that.
there
is
nothing
intricate
about
making
that
determination.
so
why
wouldn't
a
lawyer
whose
client
is
an
alien
have
an
obligation,
when
there
is
an
aggravated
felony
as
the
charge,
to
say:
this
will
be
the
consequence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
keep
insisting
on
the
collateral,
although
you
recognized
it
in
hill
v.
lockhart,
the
court
did
not
draw
that
line.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
defendant
might
say,
i
have
been
in
the
united
states
for
40
years.
i
have
a
family.
i
would
rather
take
my
chances
with
a
jury
and
get
put
away
for
a
longer
time
because
at
least
i'll
be
in
prison
where
my
children
can
visit
me.
