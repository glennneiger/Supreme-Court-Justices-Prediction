justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question:
what
do
you
think
--
if
there
is
deficient
advice
by
counsel
under
strickland,
what
do
you
think
you
have
to
prove
in
order
to
get
relief
under
strickland?
assume
that
advice
is
inadequate
--
to
prove
prejudice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
supposing
this
wasn't
a
drug
crime
--
a
sexual
abuse
of
a
minor,
which
would
lead
to
all
sorts
of
restrictions
on
where
the
defendant
could
live
and
report
and
reside
and
the
like,
would
that
be
a
collateral
consequence
or
a
direct
consequence
the
advice
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
consequence
is
something
required
by
the
law
of
the
jurisdiction
imposing
the
criminal
penalty,
it
would
still
be
collateral?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
petitioner
jose
padilla
is
a
non
citizen
who's
been
a
lawful
resident
of
the
united
states
for
more
than
40
years.
he
now
faces
automatic
deportation
because
he
pleaded
guilty
to
transporting
marijuana
in
kentucky.
padilla
claims
that
his
attorney
not
only
failed
to
advise
him
that
his
guilty
plea
would
lead
his
deportation,
but
also
told
him
that
he
did
not
have
to
worry
about
his
immigration
status
since
he
had
been
in
the
country
so
long.
he
now
seeks
to
vacate
his
plea
alleging
that
it
was
the
product
of
constitutionally
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
rejected
padilla's
claim,
concluding
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
protect
a
criminal
defendant
from
erroneous
advice
in
this
context
because
deportation
is
just
a
collateral
consequence
of
the
criminal
prosecution.
we
disagree.
in
this
case
the
consequences
of
padilla's
plea
could
easily
have
been
determined
from
reading
the
statute
that
governs
remove.
his
deportation
was
presumptively
mandatory
and
his
counsel's
advice
was
incorrect.
padilla
has
thus
demonstrated
deficient
attorney
performance.
whether
he
is
entitled
to
relief,
depends
on
whether
he
has
been
prejudiced,
a
matter
that
we
do
not
address
because
it
was
not
reached
below.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
that
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
is
joined
by
justice
thomas.
