justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
leave
something
out,
congress
can
put
it
back
in,
tailoring
the
protection
to
what
they
feel
is
necessary.
but
if
it
covers
everything
under
the
sun,
i've
never
seen
a
case
where
congress
would
take
something
out.
now,
if
we
are
relying
on
congress,
i
guess
the
circuit
would
say,
let's
go
narrow,
and
we
won't
have
--
you
know
--
since
you
referred
to
congress,
i
thought
i
would
bring
that
up
and
see
what
you
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
would
mean
that
every
--
every
businessman
--
perhaps
not
every,
but
every
successful
businessman
typically
has
something.
his
firm
wouldn't
be
successful
if
he
didn't
have
anything
that
others
didn't
have.
he
thinks
of
a
new
way
to
organize.
he
thinks
of
a
new
thing
to
say
on
the
telephone.
he
thinks
of
something.
that's
how
he
made
his
money.
and
your
view
would
be
--
and
it's
new,
too,
and
it's
useful,
made
him
a
fortune
--
anything
that
helps
any
businessman
succeed
is
patentable
because
we
reduce
it
to
a
number
of
steps,
explain
it
in
general
terms,
file
our
application,
granted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well
then,
if
that
were
so,
we
go
back
to
the
original
purpose
of
the
constitution.
do
you
think
that
the
framers
would
have
wanted
to
require
anyone
successful
in
this
great,
vast,
new
continent
because
he
thinks
of
something
new
to
have
had
to
run
to
washington
and
to
force
any
possible
competitor
to
do
a
search
and
then
stop
the
wheels
of
progress
unless
they
get
permission?
is
that
a
plausible
view
of
the
patent
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
going
to
answer
this
question
yes.
you
know,
i
have
a
great,
wonderful,
really
original
method
of
teaching
antitrust
law,
and
it
kept
80
percent
of
the
students
awake.
they
learned
things--
[laughter]
it
was
fabulous.
and
i
could
probably
have
reduced
it
to
a
set
of
steps,
and
other
teachers
could
have
followed
it.
that
you
are
going
to
say
is
patentable,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
fine.
now,
suppose
i
reject
that
view,
hypothetically,
and
suppose
i
were
to
take
the
view
that
this
is
way
too
far,
that
that's
not
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
suppose
for
hypothetical's
sake
i'm
still
a
little
nervous
about
that
--
that
circuit's
decision
there.
have
you
any
suggestion
for
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
what
i
--
maybe
i
can
get
you
to
inadvertently
help
by
--
a
hypothesis
you
don't
like.
that's
why
i
say
it's
inadvertent.
you
said
there
are
two
things.
there
are
actually
four
things
in
the
patent
law
which
everyone
accepts.
there
are
two
that
are
plus
and
two
that
are
minus.
and
the
two
that
are
plus
is
by
giving
people
a
monopoly,
you
get
them
to
produce
more.
as
you
said,
you
get
them
to
disclose.
the
two
minuses
are
they
charge
a
higher
price,
so
people
use
the
product
less;
and
moreover,
the
act
of
getting
permissions
and
having
to
get
permission
can
really
slow
things
down
and
destroy
advance.
so
there's
a
balance.
in
the
19th
century,
they
made
it
one
way
in
respect
to
machines.
now
you're
telling
us:
make
it
today
in
respect
to
information.
and
if
you
ask
me
as
a
person
how
to
make
that
balance
in
respect
to
information,
if
i
am
honest,
i
have
to
tell
you:
i
don't
know.
and
i
don't
know
whether
across
the
board
or
in
this
area
or
that
area
patent
protection
will
do
no
harm
or
more
harm
than
good.
so
that's
the
true
situation
in
which
i
find
myself
in
respect
to
your
argument.
and
it's
in
respect
to
that,
i'd
say:
all
right,
so
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
thank
you.
i
thought
that
was
the
issue,
not
the
answer.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
say
this.
i'm
just
testing
things
out.
start
with
diehr.
i
mean
--
and
diehr
has
these
words
in
it,
similar
words;
it
just
says
e.g.>
["]
--
are
you
following
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
you
say
what
is
it
they
have
done
in
this
case
in
the
federal
circuit?
they
have
pulled
back.
that's
a
mood.
they've
pulled
back
insofar
as
they
are
pulling
back
from
business
methods,
not
machines,
dah,
dah,
dah,
dah,
dah.
okay?
you
say
we
see
no
problem
with
that.
now,
they
have
left
much
unresolved.
one,
transformation;
how
broad
or
narrow
is
that?
we
don't
know.
many
people's
problems
will
be
solved
if
it's
either
broad
on
the
one
hand
or
narrow
in
the
other.
two,
are
you
automatically
patented
--
in
the
patent
statute,
if
you
just
sort
of
reduce
this
to
a
machine
by
adding
a
computer
on
at
the
end?
they've
flagged
that
as
a
problem.
they
haven't
answered
it.
could
there
ever
be
a
situation
where
it
doesn't
meet
this
test
but
still
is
patentable?
we're
not
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
see
what
i'm
trying
to
do?
i'm
trying
to
note
the
things
that
have
been
raised
in
these
80
briefs
insofar
as
possible,
say
there's
a
lot
there
for
the
future
that
we
can't
really
decide,
but
say
as
a
pull
back,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
the
correct
argument
for
the
people
attacking
the
patent
in
that
case
was
to
say,
this
is
not
a
machine.
the
machine
there
is
a
computer.
this
is
a
program
that
changes
switches,
and
that
is
a
different
process
for
the
use
of
the
machine.
now,
whether
that
process
is
or
is
not
patentable
depends
upon
a
lot
of
things
that
we
don't
have
to
go
into
in
this
case.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well,
then
what
is
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
all
we
do
is
every
example
that
i
just
gave,
that
i
thought
were
examples
that
certainly
wouldn't
be
patented,
you
simply
patent
them.
all
you
do
is
just
have
a
set
of
instructions
for
saying
how
to
set
a
computer
to
do
it.
anyone
can
do
that.
now,
it's
a
machine.
so
all
the
business
patents
are
all
right
back
in.
now,
that
--
what
i
think
we
were
looking
for
was
--
or
at
least
i
was
--
was
why
that
isn't
so,
and
how
you
are
going
to
later,
down
the
road,
deal
with
this
situation
of
all
you
do
is
you
get
somebody
who
knows
computers,
and
you
turn
every
business
patent
into
a
setting
of
switches
on
a
machine
because
there
are
no
businesses
that
don't
use
those
machines.
