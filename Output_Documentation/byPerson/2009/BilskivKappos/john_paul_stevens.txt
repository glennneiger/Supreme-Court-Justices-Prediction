justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
what
do
you
think
the
strongest
case
from
our
jurisprudence
is
that
supports
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
diehr?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's,
of
course,
nothing
like
this
patent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
language
in
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
correct
that
there's
none
--
none
of
our
cases
has
ever
approved
a
rule
such
as
you
advocate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
general
question,
too?
i
have
always
admired
judge
rich,
who
was
very
active
in
drafting
the
'52
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
he
written
anything
on
this
particular
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
how
that
can
be
a
patent
on
a
machine
if
the
only
thing
novel
is
the
process
that
the
machine
is
using.
isn't
--
isn't
the
question
--
really,
the
question
there
was
whether
the
new
process
was
patentable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry.
i
must
be
awfully
stupid.
you
say
it
would
come
out
the
same
way.
in
the
same
way
the
court
did
or
this
way
you
argued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
it
should?
you
think
it
should?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
that
isn't
just
the
application
of
a
process,
which
--
which
is
not
itself
patentable
subject
matter,
to
a
particular
machine
that
can
use
the
process--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
not
on
a
computer,
which
the
only
difference
from
the
old
computer
is
it's
using
a
new
program.
you
can't
say
that's
a
new
machine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
patent
didn't
require
any
change
in
the
hardware,
if
i
remember
it
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
justice
kennedy
has
pointed
out
i
have
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
is
an
extremely
long
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
that's
joined
by
justice
breyer,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
satomayor.
my
opinion
discusses
the
question
whether
business
methods
are
patentable
subject
matter
at
some
length,
but
this
statement
will
be
brief.
throughout
our
history
the
profit
incentive
has
motivated
progressive
businessmen
to
device
better
and
better
ways
to
conduct
business
without
any
patent
protection
at
all.
it
is
quite
clear
that
neither
the
patent
clause
in
the
constitution
nor
early
patent
law
in
england
or
america,
nor
the
authors
of
the
statutory
provisions
defining
patentable
subject
matter
ever
contemplated
that
innovative
business
methods
might
be
patentable.
when
congress
passed
the
most
recent
patent
act
in
1952,
it
used
the
term
process
to
define
a
category
of
patentable
subject
matter,
but
it
was
widely
understood
that
in
the
context
of
patentable,
the
term
process
does
not
mean
as
ordinary
speakers
might
use
the
term,
any
series
of
steps
or
any
way
to
do
anything
otherwise
the
patent
act
would
be
almost
comical.
a
process
for
deciding
whether
to
pitch
a
curve
ball
or
change
of
pace
could
be
patented.
in
the
late
1990s
a
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
suggested
that
any
series
of
steps
with
a
useful,
concrete
and
tangible
result
may
be
patented,
this
included
business
methods.
congress
was
surprised
by
this
circuit
court
opinion
and
it
quickly
responded
with
a
stopgap
measure
to
limit
what
could
be
a
significant
problem
for
business
community.
congress
passed
the
first
inventor's
defense
act
of
1999
which
provides
a
special
defense
to
claims
of
patent
infringements
for
methods
of
doing
business,
that
is
this
statute
that's
referred
to
as
section
273.
today
the
court
goes
out
of
its
way
to
state
that
at
least
some
business
methods
are
patentable.
ironically
it
relies
on
the
very
1999
act
that
congress
passed
in
response
to
the
surprise
that
business
methods
might
be
patentable
after
all.
i
think
it
obvious
that
congress
would
never
have
an
enacted
that
provision
if
it
had
foreseen
that
this
court
would
rely
on
that
defensive
reaction
to
a
surprise
development
as
a
basis
for
deciding
that
business
methods
are
in
fact
patentable
subject
matter.
accordingly
while
i
concur
in
the
judgment,
i
strongly
disagree
with
the
court's
timid
disposition
of
this
case.
