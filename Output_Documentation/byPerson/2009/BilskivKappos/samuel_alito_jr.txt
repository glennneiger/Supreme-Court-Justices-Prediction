justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
near
--
near
the
end
of
your
brief,
you
argue
that
--
that
the
patent
here
is
--
is
not
--
is
unpatentable
on
the
independent
ground
that
it
would
pre-empt
the
abstract
idea
of
hedging
consumption
risk.
if
you
--
if
you
are
right
about
that,
is
this
a
good
case
for
us
to
get
into
these
--
into
the
very
broad
issue
that
petitioner
has
raised?
