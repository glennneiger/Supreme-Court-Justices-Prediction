chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
08-964,
bilski
v.
kappos.
mr.
jakes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
i'm
looking
at
your
claim
1,
in
joint
appendix
page
19
to
20.
how
is
that
not
an
abstract
idea?
you
initiate
a
series
of
transactions
between
commodity
providers
and
commodity
consumers.
you
set
a
fixed
price
at
the
consumer
end,
you
set
a
fixed
price
at
the
other
end,
and
that's
it.
i
mean,
i
could
patent
a
process
where
i
do
the
same
thing.
i
initiate
a
series
of
transactions
with
sellers.
i
initiate
a
series
of
transactions
with
buyers.
i
buy
low
and
sell
high.
that's
my
patent
for
maximizing
wealth.
i
don't
see
how
that's
different
than
your
claim
number
1.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
your
claim
1
it
seems
to
me
is
classic
commodity
hedging
that
has
been
going
on
for
centuries.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
i'm
sorry.
just
--
what
are
the
physical
steps?
initiating
a
series
of
transactions
between
commodity
provider
and
market
participants?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
get
on
the
phone
and
you
call
the
baker,
and
you
get
on
the
phone
and
you
call
the
grocer
and
say:
i
can
set
up
a
deal
for
both
of
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
reject
--
you
reject
the
substitute.
you
think
you
can
patent
an
alphabet
because
it
is
a
process
of
forming
words.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
jakes.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stewart,
i
thought
i
understood
your
argument
up
until
the
very
last
footnote
in
your
brief.
and
you
say
this
is
not
--
simply
the
method
isn't
patentable
because
it
doesn't
involve
a
machine.
but
then
you
say
but
it
might
be
if
you
use
a
computer
to
identify
the
parties
that
you
are
setting
a
price
between
and
if
you
used
a
microprocessor
to
calculate
the
price.
that's
like
saying
if
you
use
a
typewriter
to
type
out
the
--
the
process,
then
it
is
patentable.
i
--
i
--
that
takes
away
everything
that
you
spent
53
pages
establishing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
that's
just
saying
instead
of
looking
at
the
--
in
the
yellow
pages,
you
look
on
the
computer.
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
to
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
you
look
at
your
footnote,
that
involves
the
most
tangential
and
insignificant
use
of
a
machine.
and
yet
you
say
that
might
be
enough
to
take
something
from
patentability
to
not
patentable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
it's
a
hard
question.
if
you
develop
a
process
that
says
look
to
the
historical
averages
of
oil
consumption
over
a
certain
period
and
divide
it
by
2,
that
process
would
not
be
patentable.
but
if
you
say
use
a
calculator,
then
it
--
then
it
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
footnote
--
i
don't
mean
to
dwell
on
it
--
it
says
to
identify
counterparties
to
the
transactions.
so
that
if
what
you're
trying
to
get
is
the
--
the
baker
who
sells
bread,
because
you
are
going
to
hook
him
up
with
the
grocer
who
sells,
you
know,
in
the
grocery
store,
if
you
punched
in,
in
your
search
station
--
you
know,
give
me
all
the
bakers
in
washington
--
that
would
make
it
patentable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
did
or
did
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
did
that
--
what
did
that
transform?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
jakes,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
--
the
physical
step
that
your
process
involves
is
picking
--
picking
up
the
phone
and
calling
people
on
both
sides
of
the
transaction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
08964
bilski
versus
kappos,
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
