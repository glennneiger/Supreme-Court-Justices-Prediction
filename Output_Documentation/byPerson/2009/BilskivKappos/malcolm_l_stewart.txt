mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
start
by
following
up
on
the
discussion
of
the
morse
and
the
telephone
cases,
because
it's
certainly
our
view
that
those
would
come
out
the
same
way
under
our
test
as
--
as
they
actually
did
in
practice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
[laughter]
and,
you
know,
justice
scalia,
you
mentioned
how
to
win
friends
and
influence
people.
i
think
at
a
certain
level
of
generality
you
could
describe
both
dale
carnegie
and
alexander
graham
bell
as
people
who
devised
methods
of
communicating
more
effectively.
the
reason
that
bell's
method
was
patentable
was
that
it
operated
in
the
realm
of
the
physical.
bell
had
devised
a
process
implemented
through
machines
by
which
sound
was
transformed
into
electronic
current.
current
was
then
transmitted
over
a
distance
and
transformed
back
into
sound.
innovations
as
to
new
techniques
of
public
speaking,
new
techniques
of
negotiations,
techniques
that
go
to
the
substance
of
what
is
said
may
be
innovative.
they
may
be
valuable.
they
are
not
patent
eligible
because
they
don't
deal
in
the
realm
of
the
physical.
so
while
the
industrial
processes
that
we
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief
were
at
the
time
of
the
framing
the
paradigmatic
patent
eligible
processes,
they
were
--
they
are
not
the
only
processes
that
can
be
patented.
in
a--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
--
i
think
we
would
certainly
prefer
to
win
on
our
primary
ground,
and
let
me
say
a
couple
of
things
about
that.
first,
we
would
fairly
vigorously
resist
the
notion
that
the
rule
that
was
announced
by
the
federal
circuit
is
rigid
or
inflexible.
that
is,
all
that
the
federal
circuit
has
really
said
is
that
to
have
a
patent-eligible
process
you
have
to
identify
some
link
to
a
machine
or
a
transformation
of
matter.
and
the
federal
circuit
has
said
with
respect
to
some
processes
the
link
to
the
machine
may
be
so
attenuated,
the
machine
part
of
the
process
may
be
such
a
small
segment
of
the
process
as
a
whole,
that
this
wouldn't
be
enough.
but
the
federal
circuit
said:
we
leave
for
another
day
the
hard
questions
that
will
arise
when
part
of
the
process
is
machine-implemented
and
another
part
is
not.
and
in
order
for
the
pto
and
the
federal
circuit
to
go
about
the
business
of
devising
more
precise
rules
as
to
when
particular
links
to
machines
are
sufficient
to
create
patent
eligibility,
we
first
need
to
establish
the
--
the
basic
principle
that
some
link
to
a
machine
or
transformation
is
necessary.
so
i
think
we
--
we
have
made
the
alternative
argument
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
it
is
a
basis
for
affirmance.
but
if
the
court
decided
the
case
on
that
basis,
we
would
lose
at
least
the
--
the
limited
clarity
that
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
has
provided;
that
is,
it
would
still
be
open
to
people
in
the
future
to
devise
new
contractual
arrangements
designed
to
allocate
risks,
new
methods
of
teaching
antitrust,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that
would
be
incorrect,
and
it
would
create
problems
of
its
own.
that
is,
the
--
the
innovation
that
was
held
to
be
patent
eligible
in
state
street
bank
was
not
a
process.
the
federal
circuit
was
not
construing
the
statutory
term
"process".
it
was
construing
the
statutory
term
"machine".
and
it
said,
in
essence,
a
computer
that
has
been
programmed
to
perform
various
calculations
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
this
business
is
a
machine.
it
went
on
to
say
the
opposing
party
in
that
case
had
not
raised
any
objection
under
section
102
or
103,
and,
therefore,
the
federal
circuit--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
again,
i
think
that
the
invention
that
was
held
to
be
patent
eligible
in
state
street
is
commonly
described
as
a
business
method,
even
though
it
was
held
to
be
patent
eligible
as
a
machine
rather
than
as
a
process.
so,
to
say
that
business
methods
are
categorically
ineligible
for
patent
protection
would
eliminate
new
machines,
including
programmed
computers,
that
are
useful
because
of
their
contributions
to
the
operation
of
businesses.
and
similarly,
the
court
--
the
federal
circuit
in
other
cases
has
held
that
a
claim
to
new
and
innovative
computer
software
may
be
held
patentable
as
a
process,
as
a
method
of
accomplishing
particular
tasks
through
the
use
of
a
computer,
and
those
might
be
business-related
tasks.
so,
to
say
that
business
methods
were
ruled
out
would
itself
be
a
fairly
sweeping
holding.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
the
court
said
that
in
the
limited
area
of
business
methods,
if
there
is
no
machine
or
transformation,
there
is
no
patent
eligibility--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
let
me
take
those
points--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
the
order
that
you
made
them.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
let
me
address
those
points
in
order.
the
first
thing
is
that
in
diehr
when
you
had
the
e.g.>
["]
cite,
it
was
"e.g.,
transforming
an
article
into
a
different.
"
state
of
--
state
or
thing.
and
i
think
the
obvious
inference
is
e.g.>
["]
was
used
because
the
other
prong
of
the
machine-or-transformation
test
is
use
as
a
machine.
that
is,
in
the
context
of
mr.
morse's
invention
or
mr.
bell's
invention,
there
is
transformation
of
a
sort,
but
it
wouldn't
naturally
be
characterized
as
transformation
of
matter.
those
things
were
held
to
be
patent
eligible
not
because
they
transformed
matter,
but
because
they
involved
the
use
of
a
machine.
and
so,
what
the
court
in
diehr
said
transformation
of
a
matter
or
an
article
into
a
different
state
or
thing
is
the
clue
to
the
patentability
of
a
process
that
doesn't
involve
a
particular
machine.
and
the
--
the
type
of
process
it
had
in
mind
was
the
process
that
was
described
in
corning
v.
burden
or
the
process
in
cochrane
v.
deener,
situations
in
which
an
individual
had
devised
a
method
of,
in
one
sense
--
one
case,
it
was
manufacturing
flour,
and
in
another
case
it
was
rolling
puddle
balls,
of
manufacturing
items.
and
that
person
said,
here
is
the
series
of
steps
that
you
have
to
go
through,
but
it's
not
essential
that
you
use
any
particular
tool
or
machine
for
each
of
these
steps.
that
was
why
the
word--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
guess
there
--
there
were
two
different
places,
i
believe,
at
which
we
identified
ways
in
which
this
sort
of
hedging
scheme
might
be
made
patent
eligible.
the
first
is
we
described
a
hypothetical
interactive
website
in
which
people
--
parties
and
counterparties
could
essentially
find
each
other
by
the
computer
and
could
agree
to
terms
on
that
basis.
and
in
that
situation,
the
--
the
computer
would
be
at
the
heart
of
the
innovation.
it
would
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
an
--
an
interactive
computer
technique,
one
in
which
you
sign
on
and
can
find
people
without
tracking
them
down
specifically,
can
simply
identify
yourself
on
the
website
as
somebody
who
is
interested
in
engaging
in
a
particular
transaction
and
a
potential
counterparty
can
find
you,
is
different
from
the
yellow
pages.
but
i
guess
the
fundamental
point
i
would
make
is
--
and
this
is
really
responsive
to
the
second
part
of
justice
breyer's
question
--
i
think
it
is
both
a
virtue
and
a
vice
of
the
test
that
the
federal
circuit
has
announced
and
that
we
are
advocating
that
it
doesn't
solve
all
the
hard
questions.
that
is,
the
federal
circuit
has
said
since
this
particular
patent
applicant
didn't
identify
any
machine
or
any
transformation
that
would
be
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
its
method,
that
person
is
out
of
luck,
and,
therefore,
it's
inappropriate
for
us
to
go
on
to
decide
kind
of
the
precise
level
of
substantiality
that
a
machine
or
transformation
must
play--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
all
we've
said
is
that
it
might
be
enough;
that
is,
hard
questions
will
arise
down
the
road
as
to
where
do
you
draw
the
line,
to
what
extent
must
the
machine
or
the
transformation
be
central--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
if
it's
simply
using
a
calculator
for
its
pre-existing
functionality
to
crunch
numbers,
very
likely
that
would
not
be
enough.
what
we
see
in
some
analogous
areas
is
that
the
computer
will
be
programmed
with
new
software.
it
will
be
given
functionality
it
didn't
have
before
in
order
to
allow
it
to
perform
a
series
of
calculations,
and
that
gets
closer
to
the
line.
and,
again--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--again,
we
are
--
we
are
not
saying
it
would
be
patent
eligible.
we
would
have
to
review
those
facts,
and
the
pto
would
have
to
review
those
facts
in
the
context
of
an
actual
application.
i
guess
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
simply
that
we
don't
want
the
court,
for
instance,
in
the
area
of
software
innovations
or
medical
diagnostic
techniques
to
be
trying
to
use
this
case
as
the
vehicle
for
identifying
the
circumstances
in
which
innovations
of
that
sort
would
and
would
not
be
patent
eligible,
because
the
case
really
doesn't
present
any
--
any
question
regarding
those
technologies.
and,
therefore,
we--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
i
would
say
a
couple
of
different
things.
the
first
is
that
it
seems
unlikely,
even
with
new
and
rapidly
emerging
technologies,
that
somebody
would
come
up
with
a
system
that
seems
for
patent
purposes
analogous
to
the
inventions
that
have
been
patent
eligible
in
the
past
that
didn't
involve
any
machine
and
that
didn't
involve
any
transformation.
having
said
that,
i
would
note
that
in
both
benson
and
in
flook,
the
court
held
open
the
possibility
that
some
unforeseen
event
could
take
place
that
would
--
as
to
which
the
application
would
be
patent
eligible,
even
though
the
machine-or-transformation
test--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
court
could
say
--
could
do
essentially
what
was
done
in
benson
and
flook,
namely
acknowledge
that
there
had
never
been
a
case
up
to
this
point
in
which
a
process
had
been
held
patent
eligible
that
didn't
involve
a
machine
or
a
transformation.
it
could
leave
open
the
possibility
that
some
new
and
as
yet
unforeseen
technology
could
necessitate
the
creation
of
an
exception.
but
--
and
the
point
we
would
also
make
is
this
seems
to
be
a
very
unlikely
candidate
for
such
an
exception,
because
the
hedging
method
that
petitioners
have
--
for
which
they
have
sought
a
patent
is
in
no
sense
different
in
kind
from
risk
management
techniques
that
have
been
undertaken
for
centuries--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
this
may
or
may
not
be
a
novel
or
nonobvious
method.
but
even
if
we
assume
that
this
is
nonobvious
for
purposes
of
section
103,
in
that
it
represents
a
sufficient
advance
over
the
prior
art,
that
people
skilled
in
the
art
would
not
necessarily
have
come
up
with
it,
it
still
is
a
different
in
kind
from
risk
management
techniques
that
have
taken
place
in
this
country
for
--
for
200
years.
it
is
--
it
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
federal
circuit,
sua
sponte,
set
the
case
for
hearing
en
banc.
i
believe
the
case
had
been
argued
to
a
panel,
but
had
not
been
decided,
and
the
federal
circuit
set
the
case
for
reargument
en
banc,
posed
a
number
of
questions
to
the
--
the
parties
and
the
government
did
advocate
the
machine-or-transformation
test.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
did.
it
did
advocate
the
machine-or-transformation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
know
that
our
test
--
i
think
our
test,
in
a
sense,
has
a
shorthand
version
of
that.
i
don't
know
that
focusing
the
inquiry
directly
on
whether
technology
is
involved
would
make
the
inquiry
easier,
and
that
is
so
for
two
reasons.
first,
people
could
dispute
whether
particular
advances
are
properly
regarded
as
technological
advances,
and,
second,
we
would
still
have
the
difficult
problems
that
the
chief
justice
has
referred
to,
where
you
have
a
process
that
is
described
as
involving
technology
at
some
step
along
the
way,
and
courts
will
still
have
to
make
the
determination,
is
that
a
sufficiently
substantial
step
to
make
the
process,
as
a
whole,
a
technological
one.
so
i
don't
think
that,
by
adopting
a
technological
arts
test,
the
court
would
avoid
the
difficulties
that
it
has
appropriately
identified
with
the
machine-or-transformation
test.
the
other
thing
i
would
say
about
the
machine-or-transformation
test
is
this
is
not
a
government
position
of
recent
vintage;
that
is,
the
government's
brief
to
this
court
in
gottschalk
v.
benson
--
or
its
reply
brief,
which
was
filed
around
1971
--
basically
said,
although
this
court
has
never
announced
machine
or
transformation
of
the
test,
that
is
the
principle
that
can
be
abstracted
from
the
totality
of
the
court's
decisions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--oh,
it
would
come
out
the
same
way.
i
mean,
state
street
bank--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it
was
machine
--
that
is,
in
state
street
bank,
the
claim
was
not
to
a
process
within
the
meaning
of
section
101.
the
claim
was
not
to
a
method
of
accomplishing
things
by
means
of
a
computer,
which
would
be,
potentially,
a
process.
it
was
to
the
computer
itself,
the
programmed
computer,
that
the
innovation
in
state
street
bank
was
that
the
devising
of
new
computer
programs
that
allowed
the
computer
to
perform
various
tasks
in
association
with
the
carrying
out
of
the
hub-and-spokes
investment
--
investment
method.
and,
certainly--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
didn't
transform
anything,
but
it
would
fit
--
the
transformation
part
would
be
irrelevant
because
the
machine-or-transformation
test
is,
in
our
view,
the
appropriate
rubric
to
apply
in
construing
the
statutory
term
process,
that
is,
when
the
person
doesn't
say,
i
have
invented
a
new
machine,
but,
rather,
says,
i've
identified
a
new
process
for
accomplishing
things.
if
a
person
claims
to
be
--
to
have
invented
a
new
machine,
then
that
--
it
is
either
a
machine
or
it
isn't.
a
computer
is
certainly
a
machine.
really,
the
only
--
i
think
the
only--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
what
--
the
argument
that
the
other
side,
the
person
challenging
the
patent
in
state
street
could
have
made,
but
apparently
didn't,
was
the
person
could
have
said,
of
course,
the
computer
is
a
machine,
but
a
computer
programmed
with
new
software
to
perform
different
functions
is
not
a
new
machine.
it's
not
a
different
machine
from
the
one
that
has
always
--
not
always,
but
that
has
already
existed,
and
therefore,
it
doesn't
satisfy
section
1
or
section
--
102
or
section
103,
but
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
was
--
the
way
i
would
put
it
is:
the
state
street
bank
analysis
of
the
question
that
was
actually
presented
to
it
was
correct;
that
is,
the
argued
was
made
the
programmed
computer
is
patentable
as
a
machine--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
under
our
test,
we
would
come
out
the
same
way
because
the
computer
would
be
a
machine.
the
only
question
would
be
whether
the
programming
of
the
computer
with
new
software
caused
it
to
be
a
patentable
different
machine
from
the
one
that
existed
previously.
now
--
now,
we
do
think
that
software
innovations
can
have
the
effect
of
causing
the
computer
to
be
a
different,
special
purpose
computer,
as
the
phrase--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
same
--
the
federal
circuit's
decision
in
state
street
would
come
out
the
same
way
under
our
test.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
but,
again,
the
point
i
would
emphasize--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
guess
--
let
me
backtrack.
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute
--
it's
reproduced
at
page
2
of
the
blue
brief
--
and
it
says
--
it's
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
"whoever
invents
or
discovers
any
new
and
useful
process,
machine,
manufacture,
or
composition
of
matter
is
potentially
entitled
to--
"
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
--
no.
i
don't
think
that
is
what
i
was
saying.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
what
i
was
saying
is
that
--
and
i
guess
the
--
the
first
point
i
would
make
is,
when
somebody
claims
to
have
invented
a
new
machine,
the
transformation
test
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
inquiry
because
a
--
a
better
television
or
a
better
dvd
player
can
be
patented
as
a
machine,
even
though
transformation
of
matter
is
no--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
but
my
--
i
think
--
first,
i
think
you
can
because
i
think
if
you
--
if
you
improved
the
hardware
of
the
computer
in
order
to
enable
it
to
perform--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
i
--
but
i
think
the
argument
that
has
been
made
with
success
--
and
pto
agrees
with
this
--
is
that
programming
a
computer
by
means
of
software
to
produce
--
to
perform
new
functions
can
create
a
novel--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
first
of
all
the
only
ruling
that
we're
--
i
backtrack
a
bit,
to
say,
we
opposed
cert
in
this
case
because
we
recognized
that
there
are
difficult
problems
out
there
in
terms
of
patentability
of
software
innovations
and
medical
diagnostic--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
didn't
think
you
would--
[laughter]
we
didn't
think
the
court
would
mess
it
up.
we
thought
that
this
case
would
provide
an
unsuitable
vehicle
for
resolving
the
hard
questions
because
the
case
doesn't
involve
computer
software
or
medical
diagnostic
techniques,
and
therefore,
we
thought
the
court
would
arrive
at
the
position
that
i
think
at
least
some
members
are
feeling
that
you
have
arrived
at,
that
you
will
decide
this
case,
and
most
of
the
hard
questions
remain
unresolved.
and,
frankly,
we
think
that's
true.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
bold
step
to
say
that
machine
or
transformation
is
the
test.
that
is,
we
have
gone
for
more--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
we
would
--
we
would
be
entirely
content
with
a
ruling
like
that.
and
we
would
say
that
the
claimed
hedging
method
here
is
not
the
sort
of
space
age
innovation
that
might
cause
justices
to
say:
this
is
just
different
in
kind
from
anything
that
the
drafters
of
the
patent
statute
could
have
imagined.
the
other
point
i
would
make
about
the
programmed
computer
is,
to
follow
up
on
my
television
and
dvd
example,
that
when
you
claim
a
machine
or
a
manufacture,
as
the
committee
reports
to
the
1952
act
said,
those
words
are
broad.
they
encompass
everything
under
the
sun
that
is
made
by
man.
and
so
a
television
is
indisputably
a
machine,
even
though
its
function
is
not
to
transform
matter.
it's
only
when
you
get
to
the
term
"process"
that
you
are
left
with
--
that
the
machine-or-transformation
test
kicks
in.
and
really,
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is:
the
term
"process"
in
ordinary
speech
is
extremely
broad.
it
can
literally
be
read
to
encompass
any
series
of
steps,
whether
or
not
linked
to
technology,
whether
or
not
linked
to
a
machine
or
transformation.
and
the
other
side
argues
you
should
construe
it
that
way
in
the
patent
statute.
i
guess
the
--
the
three
reasons
we
would
say
that's
not
so
are,
first,
under
the
canon
of
noscitur
a
sociis,
it's
appropriate
to
construe
the
term
"process"
in
conjunction
with
the
other
terms.
those
other
terms
are
broad,
but
they
all
refer
to
physical
objects
that
don't
exist
in
nature
and
are
created
by
man.
and
a
huge
array
of
very
productive,
innovative
activity
doesn't
culminate
in
the
creation
of
any
new
physical
substance,
and
the
word
"process"
surely
was
intended
to
add
something,
but
it
would
be
quite
strange
to
construe
the
word
"process"
to
encompass
the
whole
range
of
human
endeavor
when
the
other
words
are
limited
to
the
creation
of
new
things
in
the
physical.
the
second
thing
is
that
when
this
court
in
the
past
has
explained
the
term
"process",
it's
always
linked
it
to
the
operation
of
machines,
as
in
the
telephone
cases
and
in
morse,
or
to
the
transformation
of
matter
in
ways
that
may
not
be
dependent
on
a
particular
machine.
and
the
third
thing
i
would
say
is
that
in
a
sense,
there's
a
strong
"dog
that
didn't
bark
in
the
night.
"
quality
to
our
argument;
that
is,
even
though
the
court
has
never
said
in
so
many
words
that
a
method
of
allocating
risk
by
contract
is
a
patent-eligible
process,
the
economic
history
of
this
country
really
would
have
been
fundamentally
different
if
it
had
been
believed
from
the
outset
that
innovations
of
this
character
could
be
patented
and
potential
competitors
could
be
foreclosed
from
engaging
in
the
same
method.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further?
