justice

scalia
of
course,
the
government
says
that
the
--
that
the
term
on
which
it
hangs
its
hat
is
the
term
"useful
arts"
and
that
that
meant,
originally,
and
still
means
manufacturing
arts,
arts
dealing
with
workmen,
with
--
you
know,
inventors,
like
lorenzo
jones,
not
--
not
somebody
who
writes
a
book
on
how
to
win
friends
and
influence
people.
what's
wrong
with
that
analysis,
that
that's
what
"useful
arts"
meant,
that
it
always
--
always
was
thought
to
deal
with
machines
and
inventions?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
public
can't
use
it,
right,
until
the
patent
expires?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
you
mention
that
there
are
all
these
--
these
new
areas
that
didn't
exist
in
the
past
because
of
modern
business
and
whatnot,
but
there
are
also
areas
that
existed
in
the
past
that
don't
exist
today.
let's
take
training
horses.
don't
you
think
that
--
that
some
people,
horse
whisperers
or
others,
had
some,
you
know,
some
insights
into
the
best
way
to
train
horses?
and
that
should
have
been
patentable
on
your
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
didn't
anybody
patent
those
things?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
based
on
horses,
for
pete's
sake.
you--
[laughter]
you
would
really
have
thought
somebody
would
have
patented
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
old
--
how
old
were
those
--
those
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was
--
it
was
transforming
sound
into
electrical
current
and
then
at
the
other
end
electrical
current
back
into
sound.
i
mean
it
met
the
transformation
test,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
clearly
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
sound
--
sound
is
not
physical,
and
electric
current
is
not
physical?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
sound
is,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
sound
is
not
transmitted
over
the
wires.
sound
has
been
transformed
into
current,
and
current
is
transmitted
over
the
wire
and
then
transformed
back
at
the
other
end
into
sound.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
clearly
--
clearly
would
have
been
covered
by
--
by
the
test
the
government--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
certainly
hope
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
also
you
could
say
business
methods
apart
from
machines
are
not
patentable.
how
about
that?
