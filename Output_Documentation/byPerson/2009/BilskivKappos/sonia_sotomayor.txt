so
how
do
we
limit
it
to
something
that's
reasonable?
meaning,
if
we
don't
limit
it
to
inventions
or
to
technology,
as
some
amici
have,
or
to
some
tie
or
tether,
borrowing
the
solicitor
general's
phraseology,
to
the
sciences,
to
the
useful
arts,
then
why
not
patent
the
method
of
speed
dating?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
are
human
activities
covered
by
useful
arts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
are
saying
they
are
covered,
but
why
should
they
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
that
there
is
some
benefit
to
society
from
patenting
a
method
to
cure
someone
that
involves
just
human
activity,
as
opposed
to
some
machine,
substance,
or
other
apparatus
to
help
that
process?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
believe
that
that
was
the
intent
of
the
patent
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
suggesting
they
didn't
exist
because
we
didn't
give
them
patents
100
years
ago?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
they
exist
because
computers
have
increased--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no,
but
a
patent
limits
the
free
flow
of
information.
it
requires
licensing
fees
and
other
steps,
legal
steps.
so
you
can't
argue
that
your
definition
is
improving
the
free
flow
of
information.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
isn't
the
manipulation
of
electronic
signals
a
substance
that's
different
in
kind
from
just
a
method
of
how
to
go
about
doing
business
or
a
method
of
how
to
approach
a
particular
problem?
isn't
there
--
isn't
that
what
the
federal
circuit
was
trying
to
explain,
which
is
that
there
has
to
be
something
more
substantive
than
the
mere
exchange
of
information;
that
it
has
to
involve
--
it
used
the
word
"transformation".
it
hasn't
defined
the
outer
limits
of
what
it
means
by
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
doesn't,
because
we
don't
work
in
a
vacuum.
we
work
in
a
context.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
it
begs
the
question,
because
we
go
around
in
a
circle:
what
does
1952
that
had
one
set
of
manufacturing
and
other
items
that
are
technologically
tied
and
this
is
not?
so
how
do
we
discern
congress's
intent,
other
than
by
the
use
of
the
word
"process"
in
context?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
word
"knowledge"
is
not
used
in
the
act.
so
it's
not
just
useful
knowledge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
useful
knowledge
in
relationship
to
something.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
if
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--morse's
code
was
not
obvious.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
morse's
code
was
not
obvious,
and
yet--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
i
understand
that
case,
the
only
thing
patented
was
the
use
of
his
code
with
respect
to
the
telegraph
machine
that
he
proposed.
the
patent
office
rejected
--
maybe
i
am
reading
the
case
wrong,
but
it
rejected
all
of
the
claims
except
those
that
related
to
the
use
of
the
code
with
a
particular
machine.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
of
his
claims--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
was
the
only
one
that
was
accepted,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
same
thing
with
--
well,
bell's
patent
was--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--let's
not
skip
over
that,
because
the
rest
of
the
claim
in
bell
related
to
how
to
transmit
over
the
wire,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that
was
what
was
rejected.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
if
we
say
something
as
simple
as
patent
law
doesn't
cover
business
methods,
instead
of
what
the
federal
circuit
has
begun
to
say,
which
is
technology
is
tied
to
a
machine
or
a
transformation
of
the
substance?
but
i
have
no
idea
what
the
limits
of
that
ruling
will
impose
in
the
computer
world
or
the
biomedical
world.
all
of
the
amici
were
talking
about
how
it
will
destroy
industries.
if
we're
unsure
about
that,
wouldn't
the
safer
practice
be
simply
to
say
it
doesn't
involve
business
methods?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
ruling
in
this
case
is
going
to
change
state
street--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
it
wasn't
looking
at
process
or
the
meaning
of
"process".
it
was
looking
at
something
else.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
if
it
veers
the
other
way,
which
is
by
saying
that
we
exclusively
rely
on
the
machine-or-transformation
test,
that
we're
precluding
applications
of
the
patent
law
in
those
fields,
the
things
we
can't
imagine.
once
you
announce
an
exclusive
test,
you're
shoe-horning
technologies
that
might
be
different.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
help
us
with
a
test
that
doesn't
go
to
the
extreme
the
federal
circuit
did,
which
is
to
preclude
any
other
items,
something
we
held
open
explicitly
in
two
other
cases,
so
we
would
have
to
backtrack
and
say
now
we
are
ruling
that
we
were
wrong,
and
still
get
at
something
like
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
that
--
that
goes
back
to,
not
101,
but
102
and
103.
that
goes
back
to
obviousness
or
the
standard
weeding
mechanisms
for
patents.
