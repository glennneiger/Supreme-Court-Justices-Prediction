but
just
so
you
would
say
tax
avoidance
methods
are
covered,
just
as
the
process
here
is
covered.
so
an
estate
plan,
tax
avoidance,
how
to
resist
a
corporate
takeover,
how
to
choose
a
jury,
all
of
those
are
patentable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
the
basis
on
which
the
patent
law
rests
in
europe,
in
other
countries?
they
do
not
permit
business
method
patents.
it
has
to
be
tied
to
technology,
to
science
or
technology.
so
if
other
systems
are
able
to
work
with
the
notion
of
technology-based,
why
not
ours?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
was
talking
about
--
you
said
that
technology-based,
that
wouldn't
work
because
there
are
so
many
definitions.
i'm
simply
asking
you
the
question:
does
it
work
in
these
other
systems?
that
they
--
they
exclude
business
methods,
they
include
technology-based
innovations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
did
you
--
did
the
government
put
forward
this
machine-or-transformation
test?
was
that
your
test,
or
was
it
the
federal
circuit's
on
its
own?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
tell
me
what
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
did
--
and
if
you
read
judge
mayer's
opinion,
it
has
a
simplicity
to
it.
it
says,
if
it's
technology,
then
its
within
the
realm
of
patent,
and
if
it's
not
technology,
it
isn't.
if
it's
based
on
science
or
technology
--
and
that
seems
to
be
what
is
used
in
other
places.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
case
could
be
decided
without
making
any
bold
step--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
even
the
federal
circuit
didn't
say
it
was
the
test.
it
said
it
is
for
now.
we
know
that
things
that
we
haven't
yet
contemplated
may
be
around
the
corner,
and
when
they
happen,
we
will
deal
with
them.
