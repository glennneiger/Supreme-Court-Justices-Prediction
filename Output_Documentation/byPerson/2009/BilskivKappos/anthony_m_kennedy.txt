but
you
know
that
the
insurance
industry
--
the
insurance
business,
as
we
know
it,
really
began
in
england
in
1680,
when
they
discovered
differential
calculus,
and
they
had
expectancy
and
actuarial
tables,
actuarial
for
life
expectancy
for
shipping,
and
this
really
created
a
whole
new
industry.
in
your
view,
i
think,
clearly
those
would
be
patentable,
the
--
the
explanation
of
how
to
compile
an
actuarial
table
and
--
and
apply
it
to
risk.
that
certainly
would
be
patentable
under
your
view,
and
it's
--
it's
difficult
for
me
to
think
that
congress
would
want
to
--
would
have
wanted
to
give
only
one
person
the
capacity
to
issue
insurance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
in
the
insurance
case,
it
takes
a
person
to
go
over
to
the
bureau
of
statistics
and
compile
statistics
on
--
on
life
--
on
life
expectancy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
diehr
case,
the
court
said
that
in
the
end,
the
abstract
idea
must
be
in
a
process
that,
oh,
implements
a
proposal
that
the
patent
laws
were
designed
to
protect,
which
brings
you
almost
back
to
the
beginning.
you
don't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
don't
know
much
from
that
language.
but
that
was
something
that
you
could
touch,
that
you
could
see,
that
looked
like
a
machine;
the
substance
was
different
before
the
process
and
after
the
process.
and
--
and
none
of
that's
applicable
here.
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
it
would
be
different,
it
seems
to
me,
than
what
you
are
--
let's
assume
you
can't
patent
an
alphabet.
i
assume
that's
true.
and
you
can
take
an
alphabet
to
make
beautiful
words,
and
--
and
so
forth.
you
--
you
want
to
say
that
these
--
these
electronic
signals
can
be
used
in
a
way
just
like
the
alphabet
can
be
used.
and
many
of
the
scientific
briefs
say
that
their
process
is
different,
that
they
are
taking
electronic
signals
and
turning
them
into
some
other
sort
of
signal.
but
that's
not
what
you
are
doing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
state
street
case
a
machine-or-transformation
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
talk
about
the
state
street
case
in
your
brief,
and
it's
complicated
because
of
the
federal
statute
that
followed
it.
if
you
had
just
the
facts
of
state
street
before
us,
and
forgetting
the
federal
statute
was
enacted
after
it,
how
would
you
decide
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
thought.
and
is
it
--
is
it
machine
or
transformation,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
i
asked
you
about
it,
i
suppose.
just
looking
at
the
whole
case,
do
you
think
the
state
street
holding
--
the
state
street
invention
was
patentable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
would
you
come
out
in
the
state
street
case
today,
if
all
of
the
arguments
were
made
under
your
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
--
that's
a
problem
i
have.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
thought
we
--
you
thought
we'd
mess
it
up.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
petitioner
seek
to
patent
a
series
of
steps
that
instruct
buyers
and
sellers
how
to
protect
against
the
risk
of
price
changes
and
especially
in
the
energy
markets.
using
petitioner's
method,
for
example
a
large
energy
company
can
protect
against
the
risk
that
a
drastic
change
in
weather
will
lead
to
a
decrease
in
demand
for
its
product,
the
utility
company
might
worry
that
if
there
is
particularly
mild
winter
its
revenues
would
be
insufficient
to
cover
its
long-term
supply
contracts
and
so
it
may
seek
ways
in
which
to
hedge
against
that
risk.
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
sitting
en
banc
held
petitioner's
application
was
not
eligible
for
patent
protection.
the
court
of
appeals
explained
that
the
claimed
invention
at
issue
was
not
patentable
because
it
was
not
tied
to
a
particular
machine
nor
did
it
--
and
it
did
not
transform
a
particular
article
into
a
different
state
or
thing.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
case
produced
five
different
opinions,
including
three
dissents
and
students
of
the
patent
law
will
be
well
advised
to
read
these
scholarly
opinions
from
the
court
of
appeals.
section
101
of
the
patent
act
specifies
four
independent
categories
of
inventions
or
discoveries
that
are
eligible
for
protection.
processes,
machines,
manufactures
and
compositions
of
matter.
this
case
concerns
the
patentability
of
a
process.
the
act
defines
this
term
as
process,
art
or
method
that
includes
a
new
use
of
a
known
process,
machine,
manufacture,
composition
of
matter
or
material.
in
addition
the
court's
precedents
provide
three
specific
exceptions
to
section
101
broad
patent
eligibility
principles
and
those
exceptions
are
for
the
laws
of
nature,
physical
phenomena
and
abstract
ideas.
the
court
today
rejects
the
court
of
appeals
rule
that
the
machine
or
transformation
test
is
the
exclusive
test
for
whether
a
process
is
patentable.
this
court
is
more
than
once
cautioned
that
court
should
not
read
into
the
patent
laws,
limitations
and
conditions
which
the
legislature
has
not
expressed.
the
court
is
unaware
of
any
ordinary,
contemporary
or
common
meaning
of
the
definitional
terms
process
or
the
method
that
would
require
these
terms
be
tied
to
a
machine
or
to
transform
an
article.
this
court's
precedents
establish
that
the
machine
or
transformation
test
is
a
useful
and
important
clue,
but
not
the
exclusive
test
for
determining
whether
some
claimed
inventions
are
processes.
for
a
similar
reason,
section
101
precludes
a
broad
contention
that
the
term
process
categorically
excludes
business
method
patents.
the
court
is
unaware
of
any
argument
that
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
method
which
is
within
the
statutory
definition
of
process,
would
exclude
business
methods.
the
argument
that
business
methods
are
categorically
outside
of
section
101
scope
is
further
undermined
by
the
fact
that
section
273
explicitly
contemplates
the
existence
of
at
least
some
business
method
patents
by
creating
a
special
defense
applicable
only
to
those
patents.
the
conclusion
that
business
method
patents
are
always
unpatentable
would
render
section
273
meaningless.
rather
than
adopting
categorical
rules
that
might
have
unforeseen
impacts,
the
court
today
resolves
this
case
narrowly
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
earlier
decisions
in
three
cases
and
the
opinion
refers
to
those
cases
as
benson
and
fluke
and
dyer.
these
precedents
establish
that
the
claims
the
petitioners
make
in
this
case
are
not
patentable
processes,
because
they
attempt
to
patent
abstract
ideas.
today
all
members
of
the
court
agree
that
the
patent
application
at
issue
claims
an
abstract
idea
and
so
is
not
patentable.
as
judge
ryder
at
the
court
of
appeals
said
hedging
is
a
fundamental
economic
practice
long
prevalent
in
our
system
of
commerce
and
taught
in
any
introductory
finance
class.
today
the
court
once
again
declines
to
impose
limitations
on
the
patent
act
that
are
inconsistent
with
the
act's
text.
the
patent
application
here
can
be
rejected
under
precedence
on
the
unpatentability
of
abstract
ideas.
nothing
in
today's
opinion
should
be
read
as
endorsing
interpretations
of
the
patent
act
the
court
of
appeals
used
in
the
past
and
in
disapproving
an
exclusive
machine
or
transformation
test
we
by
no
means
foreclose
the
federal
circuit's
development
of
other
limiting
criteria
that
further
the
purposes
of
the
patent
act
and
are
not
inconsistent
with
its
text.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
