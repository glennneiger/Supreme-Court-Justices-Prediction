mr.
j.
michael
jakes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
circuit's
rigid
and
narrow
machine-or-transformation
test
for
all
patent-eligible
methods
should
be
reversed.
the
requirement
that
any
and
all
methods
must
be
either
tied
to
a
particular
machine
or
transform
specific
subject
matter
doesn't
find
any
basis
in
either
the
language
of
section
101
or
anywhere
in
the
patent
statute.
it's
not
required
by
this
court's
precedence,
and
it's
contrary
to
the
established
principle
that
section
101
should
be
read
broadly
to
accommodate
unforeseen
advances
in
the
useful
arts.
there
are
recognized
exclusions
from
section
101,
from
that
broad
language,
such
as
laws
of
nature,
natural
phenomenon,
and
abstract
ideas.
those
may
not
be
patented.
but
these
exceptions,
which
are
drawn
from
the
court's
precedent,
including
this
court's
diehr
case,
also
find
support
in
the
statutory
language,
which
says
that
any
process
must
be
new
and
useful.
so
the
prohibition
against
patenting
laws
of
nature
or
abstract
principles
--
it
applies
equally
to
all
four
categories
of
subject
matter
under
101,
but,
here,
the
federal
circuit
has
created
a
new
test
just
for
processes
that
are
not
found
in
the
statute
or
required
by
this
court's
decisions--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--certainly,
"useful
arts"
encompasses
industrial
processes,
manufacturing
processes,
but
it
has
never
been
limited
just
to
those
types
of
processes.
i'll
admit
that
during
the
industrial
revolution
most
of
the
inventions
concerned
machines
and
manufacturing
processes.
but
we
have
cited
counter-examples
that
show
that
business
was
also
within
the
useful
arts.
it's
also
up
to
congress
to
decide
how
to
implement
the
patent
system
and
the
statutory
scheme--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--congress
has
acted
in
certain
circumstances.
one
of
them
is
in
section
273,
to
provide
prior
user
rights
for
business
methods.
another
area
is
287(c),
where
medical
activities
are
also
exempted
from
remedies
under
the
statute.
there
has
been
a
bill
introduced
to
exempt
tax
avoidance
methods,
but
that
has
not
yet
been
passed.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
they
are
eligible
for
patenting
as
processes,
assuming
they
meet
the
other
statutory
requirements--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--it
is
potentially
patentable,
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
no,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
that
way,
but
i
do
believe
that--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--well,
first
of
all,
i
think,
looking
at
what
are
useful
arts,
it
does
exclude
some
things.
it
does
exclude
the
fine
arts.
speaking,
literature,
poems
--
i
think
we
all
agree
that
those
are
not
included,
and
there
are
other
things
as
well.
for
example,
a
corporation,
a
human
being
--
these
are
things
that
are
not
covered
by
the
statutory
categories--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--human
activities
are
covered.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
i
believe
the
statute
provides
for
them
to
be
covered
by
defining
them
as
a
process.
i
can
give
you
a
--
one
good
example,
which
would
be
a
surgical
method
performed
by
a
doctor.
those
are
patentable.
they
are
patent
eligible.
in
section
287(c),
congress
has
carved
out
and
said,
you
can't
go
after
the
doctor
for
infringement,
but
that
is
an
entirely
human
activity,
and
it
has
long
been
patentable.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
i
believe
that
falls
within
the
useful
arts,
and
i
believe
that
there
is
an
advantage
to
that.
there
are
really
two
advantages
to
the
patent
system.
one
is
encouraging
people
to
come
up
with
new
things,
such
as
a
surgical
method
or
a
method
of
hedging
consumption
risk.
the
other
is
the
disclosure
aspect.
a
doctor
might
choose
to
keep
it
secret.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
potentially.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
i
think
that
we
should
go
back
to
the
first
principles
that
were
enunciated
in
diehr
and
other
cases,
that
abstract
ideas
per
se
are
not
patentable.
that's
my
position,
and
what
i
would
advocate
in
this
case
and
in
any
case,
as
long
as
you're--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--if
that
was
a
novel
and
unobvious
method,
then
it
should
be
patentable,
but
it's
eligible
as
subject
matter--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--your
honor,
if
that
were
true,
then
we
should
run
afoul
of
the
obviousness
provision
under
section
103.
now,
the
patent
office
did
initially
allow
some
of
our
claims
over
the
prior
art.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
i
think
that
method
would
be
patent
eligible.
but,
as
you
said,
it
would
have
to
be
reduced
to
a
concrete
set
of
steps,
like
our
claim
1.
now,
claim
1
may
be
written
in
broad
terms,
and
it
may
some
day
run
into
the
prior
art,
but
it
does
require
people
to
do
actual
things.
i
think
even
the
patent
office
agreed
that
there
are
physical
steps
in
our
method
here.
and
in
the
insurance
method--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--that
would
be
one.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
it
could
be.
it
could
be
done
that
way
because
it
does
take
a
person
acting
to
do
that.
it's
not
purely--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--that
could
be.
now,
a
patent
on
the
data
--
that's
another
category
that's
not
included
in
the
subject
matter
of
those
four
categories.
the
data
itself
is
not
patentable,
but
if
it
is
a
series
of
steps,
it
should
be
eligible
as
long
as
it
meets
the
other
statutory
requirements
as
a
process.
there's
nothing
in
the
useful
arts
--
now,
we
have
heard
the
word
"technology".
that
can
be
a
difficult
term,
because
"technology"
in
its
broadest
sense
means
the
application
of
knowledge
as
opposed
to
general
knowledge--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--i
would
agree,
your
honor.
there
are
those
systems
that
do
have
a
requirement
like
that.
ours
does
not.
ours
speaks
in
very
broad
terms
about
any--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--that's
right.
but
they
have
also
defined
"technology"
in
such
a
way
as
to
exclude
business
methods.
and
i
don't
think
we
can
do
that.
the
fields
of
operations
research,
industrial
engineering,
even
financial
engineering
--
there
has
been
an
explosion
in
these
particular
fields,
and
to
now
call
them
non-technological
because
they
didn't
exist
over
100
years
ago
wouldn't
make--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--no.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
it's
very
much
related
to
our
current
economy
and
state
of
technology,
with
computers
and
the
internet
and
the
free
flow
of
information.
but
that's
what--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--your
honor,
i
would,
because
of
the
disclosure
requirement
of
the
patent
laws.
it
requires
people
to
disclose
their
inventions
rather
than
keeping
them
secret,
so
there
is
a
second
benefit
to
the
patent
system
just
other
than
encouraging
people
to
invent,
and
that
is
to
have
that
information
get
to
the
public
generally.
and
in
exchange
for
that--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--until
the
patent
expires,
if
a
valid
patent
issues
on
that,
yes.
but
that's
our
system.
we
do
give
exclusive
rights
in
exchange
for
that
information
being
provided
to
the
public.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
i
would
say
it's
the
diehr
case.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
diehr.
diamond
v.
diehr.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
no,
it's
not,
but
i
think
it--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--it
outlines
the
general
principles--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--and
also
tells
us
that
there
are
only
these
specific
things
that
are
not
included
within
the
subject
matter.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
i
don't
think
this
particular
subject
matter
has
been
ruled
on
by
the
court.
now,
in
dann
v.
johnston
in
the
seventies,
there
was
a
case
that
could
have
been
decided
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
method
of
doing
business,
and
instead
the
court
chose
to
decide
that
case
based
on
obviousness.
and
really--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--they
might
have,
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
i
think
our
economy
was
based
on
industrial
process.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
there
are
also
issues
with
enforcement.
i
can't
really
answer
why
somebody
wouldn't
have.
there
are
teaching
methods
that
were
patented.
there
are
a
number
of
them
that
we've
included
in
our
brief
where
there
were
patents
issued
for
teaching
methods,
and
i
don't
think
that
we've
had
a
serious
enforcement
problem
with
people
being
sued
for
using
teaching
methods.
but
there
have
been
those
people
who
have
sought
to
patent
them
rather
than
keep
them
as
secrets
or
just
use
them.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
they
range.
some
of
them
go
back
quite
a
ways,
to
the
last
century.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
he
has
written
a
number
of
things.
and
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
the
solicitor
general
quotes
in
their
brief
is
from
an
article
that
he
wrote.
but
he
also
wrote
the
alappat
decision
and
the
state
street
bank
case
as
well
and
those
that
i
think
stand
as
his
views,
his
latest
views
on
what
was
patent-eligible
subject
matter,
looking
at
the
state
street
bank
case.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
it
does.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
the
diehr
invention
was
an
industrial
process
of
the
conventional
type,
because
it
was
a
method
of
curing
rubber.
but
today
the
raw
materials
are
just
as
likely
to
be
information
or
electronic
signals,
and
to
simply
root
us
in
the
industrial
era
because
that's
what
we
knew
i
think
would
be
wrong
and
contrary
to
the
forward-looking
aspect
of
the
patent
laws.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
but
by
rigidly
looking
at
that
transformation
test,
what
you
do
is
you
exclude
lots
of
other
things
where
the
transformation
is
not
required--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--i
think
the
answer
is
to
follow
the
statute.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
congress
has
spoken
in
broad
terms
and
given
us
those
four
categories,
and
by
looking
at
those,
i
think
that
answers
the
question.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
i
think
that
"process"
is
not
by
itself.
it
says
"any
new
and
useful
process".
and
so
we
have
--
we
can
look
at
those
words
and
understand
that
natural
phenomena,
laws
of
nature,
which
are
not
really
new
because
they
are
part
of
the
storehouse
of
knowledge
available
to
everyone,
and
"useful",
meaning
there
has
to
be
a
practical
application.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
no.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
practically
applied,
yes,
in
the
real
world,
whether
that's
the
exchange
of
information
or
electronic
data
transformation.
one
of
the
problems
with
the
transformation
test
is
that
it
would
exclude
some
valuable
inventions
that
i
think
everyone
would
agree
are
technological
under
any
test
such
as
data
compression,
such
as
fm
radio.
even
bell's
claim,
the
claim
to
transmitting
sound
using
undulating
current,
wouldn't
necessarily
pass
the
transformation
test.
so
i
think
we
need
to
look
at--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--that
may
be,
but
those
signals
could
also
be
transmitted.
on
--
on
your
question
about
the
alphabet,
you
said
look
at
the
morse
claim
5,
which
was
an
alphabet
to
morse
code.
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
it
was--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--it
could
be,
yes.
now,
i
think
you
run
into
all
kinds
of
other
problems.
and
that's
really
where
the
focus
of
the
patent
statute
should
be,
so
that
we
have
the
fair
give-and-take,
the
bargain
that
is
necessary,
that
we
--
too
much
overpatenting
as
opposed
to
too
little.
the
test
there
is
obviousness.
that's
where
it
takes
place,
not
at
this
threshold.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
what
is
that?
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
no,
it
wasn't.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
it
--
it
does
say
used
in
connection
with
telegraphy.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
well--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--in
morse's
claims,
i
believe
it
was
claim
8
was
the
one
that
was
rejected,
and
the
rest
of
them
were
accepted.
claim
8
was
the
very
broad
claim
to
transmitting
information
over
a
distance,
however
accomplished--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--his
disclosure
did,
but
his
actual
claim
was
interpreted
as
being
using
undulating
current
to
transmit
sound,
however
that
was
accomplished.
it
was
very
broad,
and
that's
why--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--no.
bell's
claim
was
not
rejected.
that
one
was
approved,
yes.
the
morse
claim,
claim
8,
was
the
broad
claim
that
really
we
would
probably
look
at
today
as
being
--
as
having
inadequate
disclosure
because--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--it
might
have.
it
might
have.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
well,
it's
not
that
clear
from
the
federal
circuit's
transformation
test
whether
that
would
apply
or
not,
because
although
the
federal
circuit
has
said
transformation
of
data
might
qualify,
it
said
it
has
to
represent
something
physical,
something
--
a
real
object.
and
sound
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
that.
sound
can
be
generated
artificially.
so--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--i
think
electric
current
is
physical.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
yes.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
it
can
be,
but
when
it's
transmitted
over
a
wire,
it's
not.
it's
something
else.
it's
an
electrical
current
then.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
yes,
and
i
would
agree--
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
--i
think
that's
more
in
the
nature
of
transmission,
much
like
our
data
transmission.
you
might
transmit
data
in
a
packet
without
actually
changing
the
underlying
data,
and
that
should
be
allowed
as
well.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
michael
jakes
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
federal
circuit
did
announce
this
test
as
the
sole
test
for
all
processes.
it
said
it
applied
no
matter
what
the
process
was.
so
we
do
have
to
face
these
difficult
questions.
i
think
the
question
can
be
avoided,
because
we
don't
need
a
rigid
test
of
this
type
based
on
machine
or
transformation.
the
question
we're
looking
at
and
should
be
looking
at
is:
are
we
trying
to
patent
an
abstract
idea?
now,
the
government
has
gone
farther
than
that
and
really
wants
to
exclude
methods
of
organizing
human
behavior.
i
think
that's
the
way
they
describe
it.
that's
really
the
business
method
rejection
in
other
words.
and
i
think
that
runs
contrary
to
section
273
of
the
statute,
which
recognized
that
there
were
business
methods
that
could
fall
within
the
patent
statute,
and
as
a
result,
prior
user
rights
should
be
granted.
to
speak
briefly
about
the
state
street
bank
case,
that
was
a
type
of
business
method
that
was
implemented
on
a
machine.
the
federal
circuit
said
it
didn't
matter.
they
weren't
looking
at
whether
it
was
in
machine
form
or
method
form.
their
reasoning
would
have
applied
the
same
either
way,
and
to
do
otherwise
would
be
to
place
form
over
substance.
and
in
a
sense,
that's
what
some
of
the
transformation
debate
is
about.
it's
form
over
substance.
why
should
transformation
be
the
key?
the
key
should
be:
is
it
a
practical
application
of
a
useful
result?
our
method,
we
believe,
is
a
practical
application.
as
the
patent
office
has
said,
it
does
involve
physical
steps.
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
clues
that
the
patent
office
has
relied
on
in
saying
whether
or
not
something
is
abstract.
since
it
is
not
an
abstract
method,
it's
rooted
in
the
real
world,
we
think
it
should
be
eligible
to
have
its
examination
at
the
patent
office
and
it
shouldn't
be
thrown
out
on
an
arbitrary
test.
mr.

michael
jakes
it
could
be.
it
also
requires
the
sale
of
a
commodity
at
a
fixed
price.
that
is
something
that
actually
takes
place
in
the
real
world,
as
opposed
to
a
mental
process
within
somebody's
head.
purely
mental
processes
that
are
done
just
solely
in
someone's
mind,
i
think
we
all
agree,
those
are
not
patent-eligible.
that's
not
our
method.
