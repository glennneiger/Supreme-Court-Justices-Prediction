does
that
mean
that,
even
if
we
were
dealing
with
police
officers
who
did
what
the
prosecutors
were
alleged
to
have
done
at
the
investigation
stage,
no
prosecutor,
only
police
investigators,
the
fact
that
a
trial
and
a
conviction
had
occurred
would
mean
that
the
police
officers
were
not
liable,
either?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
that
i
fully
grasp
your
answer
to
my
first
question
and
to
justice
kennedy's,
that
is,
yes
or
no,
if
everything
that
happened
was
alleged
to
have
happened,
but
it
was
done
by
a
police
officer
or
a
different
prosecutor,
nonetheless,
the
trial
went
on,
the
fabricated
evidence
was
introduced,
without
any
participation
by
the
actual
prosecutor
in
that
fabrication,
does
a
conviction
--
does
the
--
do
the
police
officers
or
the
prosecutors
that
was
not
involved
in
the
trial
get
absolute
--
are
they
--
are
they
no
more
liable,
not
because
they
have
absolute
immunity,
but
because
the
trial
and
conviction
at
which
the
evidence
was
used
overtakes
what
liability
they
might
have
had,
absent
the
trial?
is
that
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
strange
to
say
you
can
have
a
prosecutor,
who
wasn't
involved
in
the
trial,
would
have
liability,
but
as
long
as
the
prosecutor,
in
effect,
turns
the
investigatory
stage
material
over
to
himself,
rather
than
to
another
prosecutor,
then
there's
absolute
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
but
the
--
the
question
is
not
at
trial,
nothing
about
trial.
it's
the
pretrial
conduct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
that
there
--
that
there
would
be
liability,
as
long
as
it
wasn't
the
same
person
involved
in
the
investigation
and
the
trial.
even
though
there
had
been
a
trial,
you
say
--
you
answered
justice
scalia,
that
those
people
separated
from
the
trial
would
be
liable,
even
though
there
was
a
trial,
and
it's
at
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
view
that
judge
fairchild
expressed
very
simply.
he
said
if
this
fabrication
had
not
occurred,
there
never
would
have
been
any
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
no
injury
in
the
period
before?
let's
leave
out
the
trial
for
a
moment.
there
was
a
deprivation
of
liberty
during
the
investigatory
stage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
want,
before
you're
finished,
to
get
a
clear
picture
of
your
view
of
the
dimensions
of
the
claim
because
you
rely
heavily
on
the
trial
part.
everything
proceeds
as
it
was
alleged
to
have
proceeded
in
this
case,
except
that
just
before
the
trial
begins,
harris
comes
forward
and
said
it
was
all
a
pack
of
lies,
and
so
there
is
no
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
anyone
in
this
picture
liable?
the
defendants
have
been
incarcerated
for
some
time,
but
when
it
blows
up,
they're
let
out.
no
trial,
but
everything
else,
the
same.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
--
i
think
your
position
is
that
due
process
begins
when
trial
is
underway,
and
before
that
due
process
doesn't
enter
the
picture?
