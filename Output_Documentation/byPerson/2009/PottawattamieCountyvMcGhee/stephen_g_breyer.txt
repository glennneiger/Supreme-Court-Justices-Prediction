justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
we
need
that
theory?
i
mean,
why
not
just
say
what
newman
said
and
the
others
said?
there
is
no
free-standing
right.
there
is
just
a
right
not
to
convict
a
person
with
made-up
evidence,
and
of
course
a
prosecutor
insofar
as
he's
involved
in
the
prosecutorial
stage
is
absolutely
immune.
but
if
he's
involved
in
the
investigatorial
stage
of
that
event,
well,
then
he's
not
immune
absolutely.
that's
a
policy
decision.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
free-standing
rights.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
i'm
making
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mere
foreseeability.
you
can
fill
in
those
boundaries,
toffler,
not
toffler,
as
you
wish.
but
the
basic
theory
isn't
a
problem
because,
after
all,
we're
just
drawing
a
line
somewhere
within
the
stage
of
an
ongoing
tort
on
the
basis
of
policy,
and
buckley
suggests
such
a
line.
i
don't
see
a
conceptual
problem
there,
is
my
problem.
maybe
there
are
practical
problems,
but
i
don't
see
a
conceptual
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
interrupt
you
right
there.
i
would
say
they
are
not
absolutely
immune
for
the
whole
constitutional
offense.
that's
the
line
i'm
trying
to
draw.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
i
agree
with
you.
i
won't
do
it.
i'll
take
it
as
one
tort.
began
before
the
investigation
stage,
ends
with
conviction.
one
tort.
now,
within
that
tort
we
draw
a
line
and
we
draw
a
line
based
on
policy
purposes
as
to
when
the
prosecutor
is
absolutely
or
qualifiedly
immune,
and
where
that
line
comes
is
buckley,
approximately.
okay?
now,
i
don't
see
a
conceptual
problem
with
that
and
i'm
having
a
hard
time
finding
a
practical
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
different
tendency,
which
i
would
say
this
is
a
slight
fluke,
what
you're
describing.
i'm
more
worried
about
what
justice
alito
brought
up,
that,
other
things
being
equal,
i
think
it's
probably
a
good
thing
to
get
prosecutors
involved
in
the
questioning
process.
that
--
that
has
a
kind
of
check
on
the
police.
and
the
concern
i'd
have
is
that
the
--
this
will
discourage
the
prosecutors
from
becoming
involved
in
the
witness
--
witness
questioning
process,
at
least
not
before
the
police
are
well
on
the
way.
and
that
is
a
very
negative
incentive,
i
would
think.
so
what
is
your
most
pro-prosecutorial
rule
that
you
could
live
with
that
will
in
fact
minimize
the
risk
of
that
kind
of
disincentive?
now,
are
you
just
going
to
say,
well,
buckley?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
is
there
something
--
i
mean,
i
can
see
buckley
with
the,
you
know,
probable
cause.
it
turns
on
and
off
as
you're
talking
to
the
witness.
first
what
he
says,
you
have
the
probable
cause;
then
you
don't;
then
you
do;
then
you
don't.
i
mean,
i
--
i'm
not
--
i
just
want
you
to
give
your
best
thought
to
this
problem
and
tell
me
what
is
the
most
safe
rule
that
will
allow
you
to
win
your
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
amicus
briefs
here
that
give
us
a
lot
of
reason.
they
say
--
they
say
it's
very
discouraging
to,
you
know,
ausas
or
das
going
in
and
talking
to
the
witnesses
with
the
police.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
say
they
do
it
in
chicago,
i
think.
in
other
places,
they
do
it
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
also,
you're
making
me
more
worried
because
i
think,
if
85
percent
of
all
the
defendants
--
or
90
percent
plead
guilty,
it
might
be
a
highly
desirable
thing
to
get
prosecutors
involved
in
the
truth-discovering
process,
i
mean,
so
that
they
don't
just
see
themselves
as
the
job
of
--
well,
we're
going
to
take
somebody,
put
them
in
jail.
maybe
--
maybe
that's
a
reason
for
pushing
it
back
a
little
bit,
this
--
this
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
have
you
got
it
now?
you've
got
it
as
when
there
is
probable
cause
for
believing
that
someone
has
committed
a
crime?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
someone?
so
it's
someone
--
needn't
be
the
particular
person
they
eventually
indict?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
