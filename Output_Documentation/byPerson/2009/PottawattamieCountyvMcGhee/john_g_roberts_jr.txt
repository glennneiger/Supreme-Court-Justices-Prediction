chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1065,
pottawattamie
county
v.
mcghee.
mr.
sanders?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
only
if
the
--
only
if
the
evidence
is
presented
at
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
katyal.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
what
--
what
if
there's
an
acquittal?
then
you
have
at
least
a
jury
not
believing
the
evidence,
and
that
also
is
strong
support
for
at
least
supporting
an
allegation.
he
fabricated
it;
nobody
believed
it
when
it
was
presented
at
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
--
how
do
you
--
i
mean,
we
hear
that
type
of
argument
every
time,
because
there
is
usually
a
circuit
conflict
here,
and
you
look
at
one
circuit
and
say
the
world
hasn't
fallen.
but
you
have
no
idea
how
many
of
these
claims
are
asserted
and
dismissed
at
an
early
stage
or
--
or
whatever.
you're
saying,
what,
that
there
haven't
been
many
second
circuit
opinions
on
this
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
there
will
be
--
do
you
think
there
will
be
more
if
we
agree
with
your
theory?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
also
you
don't
really
know,
right?
in
other
words,
we're
concerned
about
the
chilling
effect
on
the
prosecutors.
we
don't
know
what
the
impact
of
the
second
circuit's
decision
has
been
on
the
prosecutors.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
is
the
basis
for
the
1983
claim
without
the
submission
at
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
know
i'm
not
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment
violation,
which
is
complete
whether
there's
a
trial
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
cannot
rely
on
anything
that
goes
on
at
the
trial
to
establish
the
due
process
violation,
what
do
you
rely
on
to
establish
the
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
the
question
is
where
is
it
complete,
or
do
you
say
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
complete
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
say
that
you
--
let's
say
that
you
can't
because
we
read
imbler
as
conferring
absolute
immunity
on
what
goes
on
at
the
trial.
and
if
you
can't
advert
to
that,
you
don't
have
a
constitutional
violation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
against
--
against
the
judge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
distinction
here
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
terms
of
the
chilling
impact
on
the
prosecutor,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
at
trial
or
pretrial
for
use
at
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
thought
it
was
--
i'm
sorry.
why
don't
you
finish
your
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
going
to
suggest
in
response
to
your
point
that
--
you
know,
qualified
immunity
is
really
significant.
of
course,
it
is,
but
we've
recognized,
in
a
number
of
contexts,
in
the
judicial
area,
for
example,
that
it's
--
it's
not
enough.
we
have
also
recognized
that
in
the
prosecutorial
area,
and
trying
to
draw
the
line
where
you
do
--
i
think
this
was
one
of
the
points
justice
alito
was
making,
is
that,
sometimes,
you're
investigating
and
preparing
your
case
at
the
same
time.
you
don't
just
sit
back
and
say,
i'm
--
i'm
just
going
to
look
and
see
what
i
can
find.
you
have
particular
areas.
the
prosecution
requires
you
to
show
four
things,
so
you
are
looking
at
those
four
things.
you
are
preparing
your
case,
and
you're
investigating.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
approach,
then,
encourages
prosecutors
to
be
trigger
happy.
they're
prosecuting
right
now
because
they
know,
then,
that
everything
else,
they
have
absolute
immunity,
so
--
you
know,
shoot
first
and
ask
questions
later.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
just
begin
the
formulation.
i'm
--
i'm
starting
to
prosecute
this
person,
rather
than
saying,
let's
look,
let's
investigate,
let's
interview,
and
then
decide
who
we're
going
to
prosecute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
you've
got
a
cfo,
you
can
--
you
know,
you've
probably
got
probable
cause
to
go
after
him
as
well,
but
you
want
to
begin
interviewing
him,
to
see
if
he's
going
to
flip
in
your
case
against
the
ceo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you've
got
--
you've
got
to
make
that
decision
early
in
the
process,
rather
than
later.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
sanders,
you
have
five
--
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
