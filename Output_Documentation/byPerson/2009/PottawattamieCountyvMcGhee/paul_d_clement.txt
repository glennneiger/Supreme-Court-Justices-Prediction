mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
listen
to
petitioners,
i
hear
two
arguments
to
why
there
ought
to
be
liability
for
the
prosecutor
--
rather,
for
the
police
officer
and
not
the
prosecutor,
and
both
of
those
are
arguments
this
court
has
already
heard
and
rejected.
on
the
immunity
issue,
the
argument
petitioners
make
seems
to
distill
to
the
proposition
that
as
long
as
you're
suing
a
prosecutor
for
injuries
inflicted
at
trial,
the
prosecutor
ought
to
have
absolute
immunity.
now,
that's
not
a
crazy
theory
of
immunity.
it's
exactly
the
theory
of
immunity
that
the
seventh
circuit
adopted
in
the
buckley
decision
and
this
court
reversed,
unanimously
as
to
the
press
conference
and
by
a
majority
opinion
with
respect
to
pretrial
investigatory
conduct
involving
fabrication.
if
that
sounds
familiar,
it
should.
that's
the
conduct
that's
at
issue
here.
so
the
absolute
immunity
issue
in
this
case
was
decided
in
buckley.
now--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think,
justice
alito,
the
place
to
draw
the
line
is
the
place
this
court
drew
the
line
in
buckley,
which
is
probable
cause.
and
before
probable
cause,
when
prosecutors
are
engaging
in
investigatory
functions,
i
don't
think
we
want
them
shaping
the
witness
for
trial.
i
think
we
want
them
trying
to
figure
out
who
actually
committed
this
crime
and
who
would
we
have
probable
cause
to
perhaps
initiate
process
against.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
alito,
let
me
try
to
answer
it
this
way,
which
is
you
mentioned
both
organized
crime
cases
and
insider
trading
cases.
well,
i
think
if
there
is
any
circuit
in
which
those
kind
of
claims
are
going
to
be
brought
it's
probably
the
second
circuit.
the
second
circuit
has
lived
with
this
rule
since
the
year
2000
and
the
zahrey
decision
that's
already
been
mentioned.
there
has
not
been
a
floodgate
opening,
there's
not
been
a
torrent
of
these
claims.
there's
been
a
trickle.
they
remain
very
hard
to
allege,
and
the
allegations
here--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what
would
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--as
i
hear
your
hypothetical,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
thing
that's
missing
is
the
allegation
that
the
prosecutors
fabricated
that
evidence.
this
isn't
a
case
about
coaching
a
witness.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
two
things,
your
honor.
one
is
obviously
without
the
fabrication
allegations
that
take
place
during
the
investigatory
stage,
you
would
be
protected
by
imbler.
now,
in
the
acquittal
situations,
this
court
doesn't
have
a
case
directly
on
point.
but
if
i
read
the
hartman
decision,
for
example,
hartman
v.
moore,
and
apply
it
to
this
context,
i
assume
that
in
the
context
of
an
acquittal
if
you
tried
to
bring
a
claim
like
this,
this
court
would
interpret
through
the
common
law
the
--
a
malicious
prosecution
type
element
that
you
would
have
to
satisfy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
alito,
let
me
say
this.
first
of
all,
you
are
going
to
have
to
pinpoint
those
kind
of
allegations
pre-probable
cause,
which
is
not
going
to
be
the
case
in
a
lot
of
cases.
second
of
all,
i
mean,
this
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
--
in
the
typical
case,
if
--
if
the
witness
perhaps
in
the
first
instance
comes
up
with
one
testimony
and
later
comes
up
in
--
with
a
different
story
later,
the
question
for
purposes
of
absolute
immunity
is
going
to
be,
did
all
of
the
conduct
that
you're
alleging,
the
fabrication,
did
all
of
it
take
place
before
probable
cause
attached?
and
in
a
lot
of
cases
prosecutors
don't
even
get
involved
until
after
probable
cause,
until
after
there
have
been
arrests,
something
like
that.
and
in
those
cases--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and,
again--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
the
question
would
actually
be
whether
there
was
probable
cause
before
the
re-interview,
because
if
at
the
point--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
two
things,
justice
alito.
first
of
all,
if
you
have
all
--
if
you
had
the
interview
and
the
re-interview
before
probable
cause
and
you
have
the
allegations
that
it
was
done
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
depriving
the
person
of
their
liberty,
then
you
would,
i
think,
apply
iqbal,
and
you
would
ask
under
all
the
circumstances
of
that
case
whether
it's
a
plausible
allegation.
and
this
court
is
obviously
in
a
better
position
than
i
am
to
say
how
it
would
apply
iqbal
in
those
kind
of
cases.
but
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
for
nearly
a
decade
the
second
circuit
has
had
this
rule.
now,
the
second
circuit
is
the
circuit
that
brought
you
iqbal.
so
for
that
same
decade
they
did
not
have
the
rule
of
iqbal,
and
yet
they
didn't
have
a
torrent
of
these
claims.
so,
i
think
going
forward,
if
you
recognize
these
claims--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
if
you
look
at
reported,
both
unpublished
and
published
second
circuit
decisions
at
the
district
court
level
and
the
court
of
appeals
level,
you
would
find
very
few
cases
that
even
cite
zahrey.
i
think
it's
something
like
maybe
17
i
think
is
what
we
found.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
in
the
second
circuit?
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
will
be
the
same
number
in
the
second
circuit.
now,
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
has
lived
with
the
buckley
remand
rule,
i
suppose
there
will
now
be
a
couple
of
dozen
cases
there.
but
i
do
think
it's
revealing
that
the
circuit
that
has
certainly
the
kind
of
cases
that
justice
alito
was
dealing
with,
has
not
had
a
flood
of
these
cases.
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
the
u.s.
attorney's
offices
in
that
circuit
have
not
had
to
rework
the
way
they
do
business
in
those
circuits,
and
i
do
think
that
these
are
claims
that
are
going
to
be
difficult
to
allege.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
know
for
sure.
we
don't
know
either
way,
because
either
way
this
court
is
going
to
adopt
a
clear
rule.
what
i
can
say
is
at
least
i'm
pointing
to
empirical
evidence
in
a
circuit
that
has
lived
with
this
rule
for
a
decade.
that
seems
to
me
a
better
empirical
basis
to
go
on
than
absolutely
nothing.
but
let
me
give
you
another
example,
which
is
this
court
a
couple
of
years
ago
decided
a
decision
called
hartman
v.
moore.
hartman
v.
moore
sort
of
recognized
that
there
was
a
tort
called,
i
think,
retaliatory
inducement
to
prosecute.
now,
in
footnote
8
this
court
recognized
that
actually
you
could
sue
a
prosecutor
for
retaliatory
inducement
to
prosecute
if
you
focused
on
the
investigatory
activities.
that's
exactly
the
same
basic
theory
we
have
here,
which
is
you
focus
on
the
investigatory
activities
of
a
prosecutor
and
say
that
there
is
a
valid
1983
claim.
now,
again,
to
my
knowledge
there
have
not
been
a
flood
of
hartman
claims
brought
against
prosecutors.
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--without
the
submission
at
trial
--
i
mean,
it
would
depend,
i
suppose,
on
the
circumstances.
you
could
have,
certainly,
a
fourth
amendment--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
--
and
then
maybe
i
just
need
a
concrete
hypothetical.
let's
say
--
let's
say
--
let
me
--
let
me
provide
one.
suppose
that
there
was
this
--
the
prosecutor
put
on
this
fabricated
evidence
at
trial,
and
then
the
--
the
whole
case
sort
of
unraveled
because
the
system
actually
worked
the
way
it's
supposed
to.
on
cross-examination
the
witness
cracked
and
it
became
clear
that
there
was
this
conspiracy
to
use
perjured
evidence.
now,
at
that
point
--
i
mean,
i
suppose
the
government's
theory
would
be
because
you
never
deprived
the
person
of
their
liberty,
the
knowing
use
by
the
prosecutor
of
perjured
testimony
at
trial
does
not
violate
the
due
process
clause.
but
i
hope
that's
not
the
rule.
i
mean,
i
hope
that
in
a
mooney
case,
if
you
bring
the
--
make
a
mooney
violation
against
somebody
who
is
actually
guilty,
so
you
knowingly
use
perjured
testimony
against
somebody
that's
--
that's
guilty,
so
if
you
did
a
harmless
error
analysis,
you
would
say,
well,
the
use
of
the
perjured
testimony
really
didn't
deprive
the
person
of
their
liberty
because
they
were
otherwise--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
--
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
have
a
best
case
for
that,
justice
kennedy.
i
mean,
let
me
--
let
me
give
you
what
i
think
is
a
very
good
case
that
illustrates
a
similar
principle,
but
i
--
i
will
--
i
will
be
candid
that
i
think
this
is
an
extrapolation
from
mooney,
but
a
very
sort
of
clear
extrapolation
from
mooney.
my
best
case
in
some
ways
i
think
is
malley,
because
their
proposition
seems
to
be
that
--
this
is
the
other
argument
you
have
heard
and
rejected
--
is
that
if
there's
an
absolutely
immune
act
in
the
causal
chain,
then
that
somehow
means
that
there
is
no
violation.
think
about
who
was
sued
in
the
malley.
it
was
the
police
officers.
what
did
the
police
officers
do?
they
procured
an
invalid
arrest
warrant.
now,
did
their
actions
independent
of
the
absolute
immune
act
of
the
magistrate
injure
the
plaintiffs?
no.
without
the
magistrate
issuing
the
warrant,
there
was
no
arrest,
there's
no
search,
there's
no
injury
to
the
plaintiffs.
so
we
allow
in
our
system
somebody
to
bring
a
constitutional
tort
claim,
even
though
there's
an
absolutely
immune
act
in
the
causal
chain.
the
lower
court
in
malley
actually
accepted
exactly
this
argument,
that
if
you
have
any
absolutely
immune
act
in
the
causal
chain
that
breaks
it
off.
this
court
rejected
it
and
was
frankly
fairly
dismissive,
dismissed
it
in
the
footnote,
footnote
7
of
the
opinion.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
think
it
illustrates
the
principle,
which
is
you
don't
have
to
have
a
completed
constitutional
violation
in
your
1983
action.
i
mean,
malley
illustrates
that
principle,
but
so
does
the
text
of
--
of
section
1983,
frankly.
section
1983
doesn't
force
you
to
have
a
completed
constitutional
violation.
it
provides
liability
if
you
subject
someone
to
a
constitutional
violation
or
cause
them
to
be
subjected
to
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
would
ask
--
i
would
ask
both
of
you
to
go
back
and
read
two
things,
and
i
would
particularly
like
justice
scalia
to
go
back
and
read
your
separate
opinion
in
burns.
because
in
burns
you
confronted
just
this
issue.
you
conceptualized
what
happens
at
the
warrant
stage
as
a
variant
of
malicious
prosecution
and
you
said:
now,
could
a
prosecutor,
sort
of
as
kind
of
a
complaining
witness
in
that
context,
procure
a
warrant
that
they
were
subsequently
involved
in?
and
you
said:
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
not.
i
think
you
got
it
right
there.
the
other
thing
i
would
ask
you
to
look
at
is
footnote
8
of
the
hartman
v.
moore
decision,
because
there
you
were
dealing
with
a
retaliatory
prosecution
claim.
now,
the
court's
opinion
was
very
careful
to
say,
you
know,
it's
really
not
a
retaliation
--
a
retaliatory
prosecution
claim;
what
it
is
is
a
retaliatory
inducement
to
prosecute
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
guess
what
i
would
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
try
to
take
issue
with
your
premise,
which
is
that
we
can't
advert
to
the
absolute
immune
act
at
all.
of
course
we
can.
i
mean,
this
isn't--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
would
still
say
we
do,
but
please
let
me
try
to
take
one
more
crack
at
the
premise,
which
is
imbler
is
not
a
use
immunity
case
and
this
court
has
rejected
the
proposition
that
just
because
you're
absolutely
immune
for
an
act
there's
no
evidentiary
use
of
that
in
going
after
conduct
that
was
earlier
in
the
causal
chain.
this
court
specifically
confronted
that
in
a
case
called
dennis
v.
sparks
that
was
with,
you
know,
the
granddaddy
of
them
all,
judicial
immunity,
and
said
even
the
judge's
actions
could
be
proved
up
as
part
of
a
tort
action.
so
there
is
no
use
immunity
for--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
wasn't
against
the
judge,
but
i
--
but
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
that
matters.
and
i
also
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
but
--
but
it's
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
it's
a
distinction
this
court
confronted
in
--
in
hartman
in
footnote
8.
it's
a
distinction
justice
scalia
confronted.
and
also,
the
consequences
of
accepting
their
view
is
to
really
turn
all
of
your
absolute
immunity
cases
into
a
fool's
errand.
i
mean,
think
about
kalina.
i
mean,
the
supporting
affidavit
wasn't
the
thing
that
inflicted
injury.
now,
the
thing
that
inflicted
injury
were
the
two
documents
that
the
supporting
affidavit
supported,
the
warrant
and
the
information.
now,
it
would
have
made
no
sense
for
this
court
to
say,
well,
there
is
only
qualified
immunity
for
the
supporting
affidavit,
so
let's
send
this
back
to
the
lower
court,
if
you
couldn't
even
get
into
evidence
the
fact
that
there
was
an
information
or
a
warrant.
so
too
in
the
malley
case,
of
course
you
can
use
--
now
it's
a
different
--
it's
a
different
person.
in
kalina
--
kalina,
it's
the
same
person.
or
take
a
look
at
burns,
for
example.
in
burns
the
prosecutor's
advice
to
the
police
officer,
that's
not
what
injured
the
plaintiff
in
that
case.
it
was
the
warrant
that
was
eventually
procured.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
the
sense
that
if
--
if
they
know
that
everything
they
do
at
trial
is
going
to
be
protected,
those
functions,
which
is
the
basis
of
this
court's
functional
approach
to
absolute
immunity,
are
going
to
be
protected.
now,
if
they're
going
to
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
there
is
going
to
be
an
effect
on
the
deterrent
effect
on
the
prosecutor
pretrial,
which
is
they
will
be
procured.
i
mean,
think
about
the
contrary
incentive
you're
--
you're
creating.
suppose
you're
a
prosecutor.
you've
participated
in
the
misconduct
before
trial.
you
now
have
the
decision
to
make:
okay,
i
was
--
i
was
complicit
in
the
fabrication
of
this
perjured
evidence;
should
i
put
it
on
into
evidence?
well,
let's
see.
if
i
don't
put
it
on
into
evidence
and
i
come
clean
now,
i'm
actually
liable
for
the
arrest
and
all
the
pretrial
detention.
if
i
actually
introduce
it
into
evidence
now,
i'm
scot-free.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
mean,
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
disturb
the
line
it
drew
in
buckley.
now
i
could,
because
of
this
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean,
another
thing
presumably,
justice
breyer,
you
want
to
encourage
is
having
the
police
officers
come
to
the
prosecutors
and
get
legal
advice
about
what
they're
doing.
and
this
court
squarely
confronted
that
question
in
burns
and
said
the
advice-giving
function,
which
is
a
function
only
a
prosecutor,
only
a
lawyer
anyways,
can
perform--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
kennedy,
let
me
respond.
let
me
say
why
i
don't
think
i
can
really
improve
on
the
probable
cause
line.
i
mean,
in
this
case,
the
police
officers
and
the
prosecutors
were
involved
in
this
from
the
get-go.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
evaluating
when
there's
probable
cause,
you
have
to
eliminate
the
fabricated
evidence,
and
so
i
think
that
you
evaluate
probable
cause,
but
here's
why
i
think
it's
the
right
line,
because
think
about
the
prosecutor's
special
function.
if
you
don't
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
any
individual
for
a
crime,
then
the
function
the
police
officers
ought
to
be
performing
is
one
of
a
truth-seeking
function
and
that
is
a
classic
police
investigatory
function.
now,
the
moment
they
have
probable
cause,
i'm
willing
to
listen
to
the
argument
that
at
that
point
they
shift
roles,
and
at
that
point
they're
not
looking
at
the
evidence
the
way
the
police
officer
is,
just
to
find
out
whodunit;
but
they're
looking
at
it
to
say,
well
i
have
a
job
to
do,
i
have
to
put
a
case
on,
and,
you
know,
this
person
says
what
they
say,
and,
you
know,
there's
some
problems
with
that
and
the
jury's
not
going
to
believe
that,
so
let
me
talk
to
him
some
more.
that's
why
i
think
the
probable
cause
line
is
not
only
administrable,
but
it
makes
sense
in
this
context.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
at
the
point
--
if
the
interview
begins
and
he
doesn't
think
he
has
probable
cause,
i
think
that
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--of
course
he
is
trying
to
find
out.
but
he's
--
but
he's
not
trying
to
find
out
if
there's
probable
cause
necessarily
to
identify
a
particular
suspect.
what
he's
trying
to
do,
is
there
probable
cause
to
arrest
anyone?
and
that's
exactly
the
question
a
police
officer
asks
every
single
day.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
--
you
know,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
logical
place
to
push
it
back
any
further
is,
and
i
think
--
you
know--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
let
me
say
this,
justice
breyer,
i
mean,
i
know
you
don't
want
to
talk
about
burns,
but
i'd
like
to,
just
for
a
second,
because
i
think
it's
a
very
similar
policy
concern.
as
a
policy
matter,
sure,
we
want
prosecutors
to
get
--
to
give
advice
to
police
officers,
but
qualified
immunity
is
not
insignificant
protection,
and
think
about
that,
i
mean,
the
incentives
you're
creating
for
the
same
anomaly
that
the
court
recognized
in
buckley.
the
incentive
would
really--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
just
wanted
to
say
the
incentive
would
really
be
perverse.
under
burns,
if
the
police
--
if
the
police
officer
comes
to
the
prosecutor
and
says
--
you
know,
we
want
to
fabricate
evidence
to
frame
it,
can
we
do
it?
and
the
prosecutor
says,
yes,
you
can
do
that,
go
ahead;
there's
qualified
immunity.
now,
if
the
prosecutor
says,
go
ahead
and
let
me
help,
there
would
somehow
be
absolute
immunity.
i
mean,
that
is
really
an
anomalous
result,
that
it's
the
n
anomaly
that
caused
this
court
in
buckley
to
draw
the
line
at
probable
cause.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and,
again,
the
court
addressed
exactly
this
court
in
the
--
exactly
that
issue
in
the
buckley
decision
and
said,
sure
--
you
know,
from
--
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
you
can
sort
of
retrospectively
look
and
make
anything
in
the
investigatory
stage
part
of
--
and
part
and
parcel
of
the
prosecution.
and
i
don't
think
that
was
something
that
this
court
saw
as
a
reason
not
to
draw
a
clean
line
that's
consistent
with
the
functional
approach.
it's
consistent,
not
just
with
buckley,
but
with
burns
and
with
kalina
and
with
a
whole
host
of
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
if
i
could
add,
i
mean,
i
suppose
i
might
be
able--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
let
me
say
this:
if
i
could
add
a
couple
of
words,
i
think
we
could
probably
live
with
that
line,
which
is,
if
the
prosecutor
is
interviewing
those
witnesses
with
an
eye
towards
credibility
for
use
at
trial,
i
mean,
that's
a
line
that,
i
think,
would
be,
i
think,
probably
pretty
consistent
with
probable
cause,
but
something
that
we
could
live
with,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean,
i
worry
that
words
are
being
put
in
my
mouth.
i
would
say
that,
if
the
prosecutor
is
interviewing
the
witness
for
the
purpose
of
judging
their
credibility
at
trial,
then
that's
something
for
which
you
may
be
able
to
sort
of
tweak
the
line
on
buckley
and
say
that's
covered.
i
actually
think
it
won't
make
any
difference
because
i
think
that
should
only
be
happening
after
probable
cause.
if
i
could--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
shoot
first
--
you
mean
go
to
an
impartial
magistrate
and
try
to
get
somebody
arrested
or--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
suppose--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
if
you
have
probable
cause,
then
i
think
you're
on
the
other
side
of
the
buckley
line,
and
that's
an
objective
determination,
and
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
it's
--
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
decision
you
have
to
make.
i
think
it's
actually
something
that
would
be
evaluated
objectively
after
the
fact,
and
i
think
the
way
that
this
court
should
approach
this
case
is
neither
of
the
parties
before
you
have
asked
this
court
to
overturn
buckley.
i
wouldn't
do
it
under
those
circumstances,
but,
of
course,
it's
worth
adding
that,
if
you
were
going
to
overturn
buckley,
then
the
place
to
probably
start
would
be
to
go
back
to
first
principles,
and
if
you're
going
to
go
back
to
first
principles,
then
what
you're
going
to
find
is
that
there
was
no
common
law
support
at
all
for
absolute
immunity.
and
i
wouldn't
think
that
this
court
was
particularly
interested
in
coming
up
with
implied
immunities
that
aren't
in
the
statute
and
had
no
basis
at
the
common
law,
and
that's
why
i
think
some
of
the
justices
that
have
looked
at
this
as
an
original
matter
have
tended
to
be
quite
reluctant
in
recognizing
absolute
immunity
because
it
lacks
support
in
the
text
and
it
lacks
support
at
the
common
law.
so
we're
--
we're
happy
with
the
lines
that
this
court
has
already
drawn.
but
if
the
court's
going
to
go
back
to
first
principles,
well,
let's
go
back
to
first
principles
and
look
at
--
the
at
the
statute
congress
passed
in
1871.
that
statute
did
not
provide
any
immunities,
and
i
do
think,
as
we
say
in
the
brief,
this
is
a
case
where
it's
important
not
to
lose
the
forest
for
the
trees
because
this
is
a
statute
was
passed
--
passed
in
1871.
this
is
one
of
the
great
civil
rights
statutes.
is
it
really
plausible
to
think
that
the
congress
that
passed
this
statute
didn't
want
to
provide
a
remedy
in
the
circumstances
before
the
court
today?
i
think
it's
clear,
from
this
court's
cases
--
there
may
not
be
a
case
that
lines
up
all
the
dots
exactly,
but
i
think
it's
clear,
from
this
court's
cases,
that
the
police
officer
that
engages
in
this
misconduct
has
committed
a
grave,
grave
constitutional
violation
and
ought
to
be
liable.
i
think
the
prosecutor
who
engages
in
the
pretrial
misconduct
and
then
doesn't
participate
in
the
trial
is
just
as
liable
as
that
police
officer,
and
i
can't
think
of
a
single
reason
why
the
only
reason
a
prosecutor
would
get
absolute
immunity
is,
if
they
not
only
participated
in
the
pretrial
misconduct,
but
completed
the
scheme
by
committing
further
misconduct
at
trial.
for
all
those
reasons,
we
think
the
court
should
affirm.
thank
you.
