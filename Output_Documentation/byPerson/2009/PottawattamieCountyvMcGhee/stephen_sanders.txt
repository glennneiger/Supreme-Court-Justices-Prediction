mr.
stephen
sanders
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
a
prosecutor's
absolute
immunity
in
judicial
proceedings
means
anything,
it
means
that
a
prosecutor
may
not
be
sued
because
a
trial
has
ended
in
a
conviction,
yet
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
lower
courts
may
not
fashion
exceptions
to
the
immunity
this
--
this
court
provided
in
imbler
by
purporting
to
relocate
a
due
process
injury
from
the
trial
to
an
earlier
investigation.
mr.
stephen
sanders
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so
at
all.
i
think
that
this
case
presents
exactly
the
question
that
buckley
reserved,
and
that
is
whether
the
fabrication
of
evidence
by
a
prosecutor
in
and
of
itself,
without
regard
to
its
use
in
some
way,
states
a
constitutional
cause
of
action.
in
this
case,
the
use
at
trial,
obviously,
was
absolutely
immunized
under
imbler
and
many
of
this
other
--
this
court's
other
precedents.
despite
respondent's
best
efforts
to
argue
that
there
was
some
sort
of
due
process
violation
caused
by
the
fabrication
itself,
without
regard
to
its
use
in
some
way,
there
simply
is
no
support
for
that.
mr.
stephen
sanders
your
honor,
the
fact
that
a
trial
and
conviction
had
occurred
could
mean
that
the
police
officers
were
liable
because
of
the
due
process
violation
at
the
trial,
but
in
footnote
5
of
buckley,
this
court
was
very
clear
and
insisted
that
there
is
no
disjunction
between
observing
that
a
prosecutor,
like
a
police
officer,
has
only
qualified
immunity
during
the
investigation
while,
at
the
same
time,
insisting
that
that
does
not
affect
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
has
absolute--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
it
should
be
the
same
if
the
prosecutor
in
the
second
case
that
you
hypothesize
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
later
prosecution.
in
other
words,
if
we
could
view
that
prosecutor
simply
as
an
ordinary
citizen,
simply
as
a
complaining
witness,
as
analogous
to
a
police
officer,
so
there's
no
argument
in
this
case
that
simply,
by
virtue
of
being
a
prosecutor,
a
prosecutor
has
absolute
immunity.
the
courts
below
wrongfully
abrogated
trial
immunity
because
trial
is
the
only
place
where
the
injury
of
conviction
and
subsequent
incarceration
could
have
taken
place.
without
reference
to
that
specific
injury,
there
is
simply
no
other
injury.
the--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
our
position
is
--
i
believe
i
would
agree
with
you.
our
position
is
there
is
no
liability
for
the
initial
fabrication.
as
the
united
states
explains
in
its
brief,
for
a
police
officer
to
be
held
liable
in
those
circumstances,
it
would
need
to
be
under
some
sort
of
malicious
prosecution
theory
that
would
depend
on
the
actual
conviction
and
the
use
of
the
evidence
at
trial.
but
the
use
of
the
evidence
at
trial
is
the
injury
itself,
and
that
is
exclusively
a
prosecutorial
act,
only
a
prosecutor
could--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--yes.
this
court--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--yes.
the
police
officer
--
likely,
this
court
has
never
--
never
addressed
the
issue.
the
police
officer
would
likely
be
liable
because
the
police
officer
would
have
no
immunity
for
the
use
of
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
sanders
if
the
prosecutor
performed
no
prosecutorial
function,
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
sanders
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
sanders
but
only
if
the
evidence
is
presented
at
trial
because
that's
the
only
way
the
evidence
can
provide
injury
and
so--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
not
the
more
deeply
you
are
involved,
it's
whether
you
are
in
the
unique
position
of
a
prosecutor
to
cause
injury
by
use
of
the
evidence
at
trial.
that
is
exclusively
a
prosecutorial
function.
the
function
test
of
--
of
buckley
goes
to
what
function
someone
is
performing,
but
only
the
prosecutor
can
ever
perform
the
function
of
actually
using
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
sanders
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
the
court,
more
than
80
years
ago,
when
it
summarily
affirmed
yaselli
v.
goff
from
the
second
circuit,
spoke
to
this
question.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
--
affirmed
the
second
circuit
in
its
view
that,
if
a
prosecutor
cannot
--
if
a
prosecutor
has
absolute
immunity
for
acting
maliciously
at
trial,
that
immunity
cannot
be
circumvented--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--the
--
the
odd
thing
about
--
if
we
are
taking
out
reference
to
the
trial
itself,
then
there
simply
can
be
no
claim.
respondents
urge
a
new
freestanding
right,
separate
and
apart
from
the
due
process
trial
right,
yet
at
the
same
time--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
looking
to
the
common
law,
the
rationale
for
that
would
be
a
form
of
malicious
prosecution,
but
as
you
observed
in
your
concurrence
in
albright,
asserting
malicious
prosecution
against
a
prosecutor
would
be
anomalous
because
it's
the
prosecutor
who
is
exclusively
responsible
for
causing
the
kind
of
injury.
if
a
police
officer
or
a
nonprosecuting
prosecutor
simply
fabricates
the
evidence,
as
chief
judge
easterbrook
of
the
seventh
circuit
said,
there
can
be
no
cause
of
action.
it
is
the
exclusive
function
of
a
prosecutor
in
a
case
who
uses
the
evidence
who
can
cause
the
injury,
and
although--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
this
court
has
not
spoken
to
that
question,
but
as
you
stated,
that
would
be
the
rationale
of
the
restatement
actually.
the
restatement
says,
if
there
is
no
deception
of
the
prosecutor,
then
it
is
the
prosecutor's
willful
and
free
will
use
of
the
evidence
at
trial.
mr.
stephen
sanders
uh-hmm.
mr.
stephen
sanders
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
analysis
is
not
that
it
--
because
it
leads
to
the
injury
itself.
the
tort
of
wrongful
conviction
based
on
use
of
false
evidence
at
trial
has
only
one
element
under
this
court's
precedents
in
pyle
and
mooney
and
hysler
and
rochin.
that
element
is
the
prosecutor's
use
of
the
evidence
at
trial.
but
simply
because
that
act
is
absolutely
immune
is
not
to
say
that
someone
else
who's
responsible
for--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
sanders
well--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--because
that
is
the
way
a
prosecutor
would
be
held
liable.
the
cause
of
action
against
a
prosecutor,
even
though
he
would
be
absolutely
immune,
would
be
the
prosecutor's
knowing
or
even
unknowing
use
of
the
false
evidence
at
trial.
but
in
this
case,
respondents
ask
for
a
free-standing
due
process
right
that
would
somehow
at
the
same
time
protect
the
interest
against
wrongful
conviction
at
trial.
that
simply
can't
be.
this
court's
decision--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
as
we
discussed
in
our
opening
brief
in
this
case,
i
think
that
judge
fairchild's
reasoning
is
classic
malicious
prosecution
reasoning.
that
is,
that
it's
the
false
evidence
that
impelled
the
prosecution.
but
again,
this
court
has
been
absolutely
clear
that
a
malicious
prosecution
theory
cannot
be
asserted
against
a
prosecutor
because
a
prosecutor
can
initiate
willfully
and
maliciously
a
wrongful
prosecution
based
on
good
evidence,
bad
evidence,
or
no
evidence
at
all.
it's
simply
untenable
to
say
--
and
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
van
de
kamp
made
clear
that
where
the
injury
comes
at
trial,
where
that
is
the
interest
protected
against,
that
you
can
somehow
abrogate
immunity
and
continue
with
a
case
based
on
that
kind
of
claim
based
on
a
claim
of
an
earlier
due
process
right--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
i
think
any
earlier
deprivation
of
liberty
would
be
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
implicated
in
the
question
presented
here.
it
has
not
been
briefed.
surely
there
would
be
an
interest
against
wrongful
seizure
or,
since
this
--
these
arrests
were
pursuant
to
legal
process,
against
a
form
of
malicious
prosecution.
but
again,
that
would
be
a
fourth
amendment
theory
and
it
could
not
be
asserted
if
it
is
malicious
prosecution
against
a
prosecutor.
mr.
stephen
sanders
your
honor,
this
court
has
not
addressed
that
issue.
that
is
the
view
of
some
of
the
circuits
and
the
restatement.
mr.
stephen
sanders
we're
assuming
that
to
be
correct,
but
if
i--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--a
police
officer
would
never
get
immunity
at
trial
because--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--the
theory
of
the
common
law
on
malicious
prosecution
would
be
that
the
police
officer
is
liable
because
his
fabrication
of
evidence
impelled
the
proceeding,
caused
the
proceeding.
mr.
stephen
sanders
the
basis
for
liability
precisely
against
the
police
officer
would
be
the
violation
of
the
due
process
right
to
a
fair
trial,
wrongful
conviction
on
the
basis
of
the
introduction--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--this
theory
wouldn't
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
case
because
in
this
case
the
prosecutors
made
the
decision
independently
to
initiate
the
prosecution.
it's
undisputed
that
they
did
that
in
their
capacity
as
prosecutors.
they
--
the
police
officers'
act
could
not
cause
injury
but
for
the
immunized
act
of
a
prosecutor
beginning
the
prosecution
and
conducting
the
trial.
mr.
stephen
sanders
but,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--i
think
that
that
reasoning
would
be
to
what
this
court
affirmed
in
yaselli
and
what
this
court
has
said
--
and
which
the
court
has
repeatedly
cited
favorably,
and
that
is
--
and
it
would
also
run
up
against
the
concerns
that
justice
kennedy
indicated
in
his
concurrence
in
buckley,
which
this
--
the
majority
in
buckley
also
disputed
and
said
there
is
no
disjunction
between
qualified
immunity
for
a
prosecutor
during
an
investigation
but
absolute
immunity
for
the
act
of
setting
the
prosecution
in
motion.
the
court
was
absolutely
clear
in
footnote
5
of
buckley
that
there
was
no
disjunction,
and
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
malley
v.
briggs
and
other
cases,
anything
other
than
absolute
immunity
for
a
prosecutor
would
impair
the
--
would
impair
the
performance
of
a
central
actor
in
the
judicial
process.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
sanders
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
four
main
points.
beginning
with
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
zahrey
and
subsequent
cases
in
the
second
circuit,
have
significantly
cut
back
on
the
meaning
of
zahrey.
the
wray
decision,
which
we
discussed
in
our
reply
brief,
the
gonzalez
decision,
which
we
discussed
in
our
opening
brief,
have
not
allowed
for
this
kind
of
continuous
liability
for
a
prosecutor.
they
have
made
very
clear,
particularly
the
gonzalez
decision,
that
when
it
is
a
prosecutor's
actions
before
a
judge
advocating
on
behalf
of
the
state,
that
are
responsible
for
a
deprivation
of
liberty,
in
that
situation,
absolute
immunity
applies.
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
the
consequences--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
to
--
i
think
it's
to
say
that
the
zahrey
decision
has
not
had
the
kind
of
impact
and
has
not
been
applied
in
a
way
that
respondents
are
asking
for
it
to
be
applied.
mr.
stephen
sanders
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
stephen
sanders
the
--
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
the
consequences
of
affirming
the
courts
below,
either
on
the
basis
of
the
zahrey
theory
or
on
the
freestanding
due
process
theory
offered
by
respondents.
it
would
work
a
radical
change
in
the
law
of
immunity
because
it
would
mean
that
far
more
wrongful
conviction
claims
against
prosecutors
would
go
forward
under
only
qualified
immunity.
that
is
the
inevitable
consequence
of
affirming
the
courts
below
in
this
case.
these
cases
are
not
difficult,
as
justice
alito
said,
to
plead,
particularly
because,
in
most
of
these
sorts
of
cases,
most
of
the
discovery
will
have
been
done
during
the
post-conviction
review
process.
and
so
there
will
be
plenty
of
--
plenty
of
grounds
for
a
plaintiff
to
allege
a
plausible
violation
during
the
investigative
process
and
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
survive
summary
judgment,
even
if,
ultimately,
that
comes
to
nothing,
the
consequence
would
be
to
hold
prosecutors
to
inconsistent
standards
of
liability,
qualified
immunity
or
absolute
immunity,
based
simply
on
the
allegations
in
a
complaint,
something
this
court
has
specifically
said
is
--
is
not
appropriate
and
should
not
be--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--uh-huh.
mr.
stephen
sanders
your
honor,
i
believe
there
would
be
no
due
process
liability.
there
might
be
two
independent
grounds
for
liability
under
some
fourth
amendment
malicious
prosecution
theory,
which
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
possibly
under
state
law
remedies,
as
justice
kennedy
and
justice
thomas
indicated
in
their
concurrence
in
albright,
we
do
not
go
to
the
federal
constitution's
due
process
clause
unless
we're
sure
that
the
plaintiffs
have
exhausted
their
possible
remedies
under
state
law.
in
this
case,
iowa
state
law
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
malicious
prosecution.
mr.
stephen
sanders
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
court's
decisions
make
clear
that
due
process
applies
to
the
judicial
process;
that
is,
the
filing
of
charges
and
the
later
conduct
of
the
prosecuting--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
it
would
be,
but
that
would
be
fourth
amendment
territory.
mr.
stephen
sanders
your
honor,
this
court
--
seven
justices
in
this
court's
decision
in
albright
agreed
that
there
was
no
due
process
cause
of
action
for
the
wrongful
institution
of
criminal
proceedings,
that
in
that
case
there
may
be
some
sort
of
fourth
amendment
claim.
there
may
be
some
sort
of
state
law
claim
under
parrot
v.
taylor,
but
i
have
not--
mr.
stephen
sanders
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
court's
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
would
still
indicate
that
that
is
a
concern
of
the
fourth
amendment,
not
the
due
process
clause,
and
that
pursuant
to
paul
v.
davis
and
parrot
v.
taylor,
there
may
indeed
be
some
sort
of
state
law
cause
of
action
for
defamation
or
loss
of
status,
but
that
there
is
no
support
for
a
federal
due
process
claim.
