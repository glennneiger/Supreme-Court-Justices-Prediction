mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
v.
fitzsimmons
the
question
presented
today,
which
is
whether
a
cause
of
action
exists
against
prosecutors
alleged
to
have
fabricated
evidence.
respondents'
answer
to
this
question
asks
this
court
to
announce
for
first
time
ever
that
there
is
a
free-standing
due
process
right
not
to
be
framed.
that
theory
would
untether
due
process
from
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
which
is
the
process
a
defendant
is
due
before
being
deprived
of
liberty.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
respondents'
primary
submission
before
this
court
is
not
that
argument.
they
don't
rest--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--right,
and
with
respect
to
that
i
think
we
have
several,
several
responses.
the
first
is
that
this
court
has
rejected
that
kind
of
mere
foreseeability
analysis
in
the
context
of
section
1983.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
there
are
practical
and
conceptual
problems,
which
is
why
buckley
reserved
precisely
this
question
in
footnote
5,
and
here's
the
basic
policy
or
conceptual
concern.
our
point
is
that
if
a
section
1983
defendant
is
absolutely
immune
for
the
constitutional
wrong,
then
you
can't
read
back
in
time;
a
plaintiff
can't
look
back
in
time
and
isolate
some
other
acts
as
to
which
they
are
nonimmune
and
thereby--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and,
justice
breyer,
i'm
saying
to
do
that
requires
you
to
read
the
due
process
violation
as
occurring
sometime
before
the
trial,
and
then
we're
back
to
the
free-standing
rationale
and
the
opening
up
of
the
due
process
clause
to
something
this
court
has
never,
ever
accepted.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
conceptual
problem
is
that
this
court
has
been
explicit
that
section
1983
is
not
the
font
of
tort
law.
rather,
you
need
to
isolate
a
constitutional
violation.
here,
the
constitutional
violation
is
the
due
process
clause.
that
violation
begins,
as
this
court's
decisions
in
napue
and
pyle
say,
when
the
fabricated
evidence
is
introduced
at
trial
in
order
to
secure
a
conviction.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
because
the
policeman
essentially
induces
the
prosecution
at
an
earlier
point
of
time
and
acts
through
the
innocent
agent,
the
prosecutor,
that
introduction
of
evidence
at
trial
is
not
something
as
to
which
the
policeman
has
any
sort
of
absolute
immunity.
and
so
in
justice
breyer's
example
of
a
prosecutor
introducing
evidence,
that
is
something
as
to
which
the
prosecutor
is
absolutely
immune.
that
is
where
the
constitutional
violation
begins.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
if
the
prosecutor
does
know,
we
don't
think
that
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
due
process
violation.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
against
--
against
the
policeman
in
that
circumstance,
because
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
i
agree
that
that
seems
a
little
odd--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no,
what
i'm
saying
and
what
this
court's
decisions
have
said
is
that
absolute
immunity
doesn't
exist
to
protect
bad
apples.
it
reflects
a
larger
interest
in
protecting
judicial
information
coming
into
the
judicial
process.
and
if
prosecutors
have
to
worry
at
trial
that
every
act
they
undertake
will
somehow
open
up
the
door
to
liability,
then
they
will
flinch
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
and
not
introduce
that
evidence.
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
the
police
officer,
who
is
liable,
and
the
prosecutor,
who
is
--
who
is
absolutely
immune.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
sotomayor,
we
absolutely
want
to
send
that
message.
the
worry
is
that
allegations
of
wrongdoing,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
imbler
and
van
de
kamp,
can
--
can
supersede
that.
and
just
to
give
you--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
believe
that
is
correct,
and
i
also
believe
that
no
ethics
complaints
were
ever
brought.
that
is,
rather
the
respondents
went
into
federal
court
seeking
money
damages
instead
of
ethics
violations
and
the
like.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
debate
in
the
briefs
before
this
court,
including
the
brief
by
12,400
or
so
prosecutors
that
takes
the
reverse
view.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i
think
that
is
a
question
for
the
legislature.
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
those
ethics
and
disciplinary
violations
are
--
are
a
successful
deterrent,
and
there
is
others
as
well
that
this
court
has
pointed
to
that
may
be
available,
including
counsel's
liability.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
with
respect
to
a
cause
of
action
and
whether
the
principles
of
absolute
immunity
apply
to
this,
i
think
this
court
has
already
recognized
several
times
that
the
overriding
interest
is
protecting
the
judicial
process
and
not
letting
information
be
chilled
and
not
come
in.
to
give
you
a
couple
of
data
points,
there
were
14.4
million
arrests
in
the
year
2006
and
1.1,
approximately,
million
felony
convictions.
respondents'
theory
would
allow
prosecutors
in
any
of
those
circumstances
to
be
sued
for
an
alleged
fabrication
of
evidence,
and
that's
something
that
could
be
--
that's
something
that's
not
that
hard
to
envision,
since
criminal
evidence,
unlike
civil
evidence,
is
messy.
it
often
involves
cooperation
agreements,
leniency
agreements
and
the
like,
and
for
that
reason
it's
very
natural,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
imbler,
for
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
say:
well,
i'm
going
to
blame
the
prosecutor;
they
fabricated
evidence,
they
made
this
story
up;
and
--
and
then
seek
civil
liability.
and
what
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
is
that
the
societal
interest
suffers.
and
that
is
why
it's
not
about,
justice
kennedy,
protecting
the
bad
apple
and
someone
who
exacerbates
the
harm
by
carrying
the
fabricated
evidence
through
trial.
rather,
what
this
court's
absolute
immunity
decisions
consistently
reflect
is
the
principle
that
when
someone
is
introducing
evidence
at
trial,
you
don't
want
to
chill
them
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
in
any
way
through
the
rubric
of
civil
liability.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
when
--
when
the
evidence
is
introduced
and
it's
the
prosecutor
himself
who
developed
that
evidence,
maybe
through
flipping
a
witness
or
something
like
that,
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
he
would
know
whether
or
not
it's
fabricated,
but
the
question
is
whether
he
would
know
that
he
could
insulate
himself
from
an
allegation
of
wrongdoing.
and
respondents'
theory,
which
allows
the
due
process
clause
to
be
some
sort
of
free-standing
right,
would
permit
those
suits
even
at
the
earliest
stages
of
an
investigation
and
permit
strike
suits
even
before
the
criminal
process
is
underway.
and
that,
i
think,
is
a
fundamental
point,
which
is
this
court,
no
court
has,
ever
really
accepted
the
notion
that
prosecutors
can
be
liable,
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--for
purposes
of
absolute
immunity,
and
we
agree
with
that.
so,
for
example,
justice
stevens,
in
your
fourth
amendment
decision
in
1975
on
the
seventh
circuit,
we
agree
there
is
liability
when
a
prosecutor
is,
for
example,
conducting
a
raid
or
something
like
that.
there
the
constitutional
violation
is
complete
before
the
trial,
and
whatever
the
prosecutor
does
at
trial--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
we
think
there
is
no
liability
for
pretrial
conduct,
and
so
long
as
you
agree
with
me
that
the
due
process
clause
violation
begins
only
at
the
trial--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
--
the
text
of
the
due
process
clause
says
the
deprivation
of
life,
liberty,
property
with
--
under
due
process
of
law,
and
due
process
under
this
court's
decisions
is
what
happens
at
trial,
not
before.
