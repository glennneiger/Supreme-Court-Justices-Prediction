but
that
makes
no
sense
because,
if
you
go
down
that
road,
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
neither
the
--
neither
a
police
officer
or
a
different
prosecutor
who
fabricated
evidence
could
be
liable,
either,
because
the
only
person
who
causes
the
deprivation
is
the
prosecutor
who
uses
the
false
evidence
at
trial.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
the
second
circuit
in
its
decision,
judge
newman,
looked
at
it
and
said
there
are
two
causes
to
the
injury
here.
one
is
the
fabrication,
joint
tortfeasors.
there
are
two
people
who
can
cause
any
injury
and
the
prosecutor
who
actually
puts
the
evidence
in
at
trial.
that's
how
you
hold
police
officers
and
different
prosecutors
liable
because
they
are
assisting
in
the
violation
that
is
occurring.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
doesn't
that
theory
fit
the
same
prosecutor
who
commits
two
different
acts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
commits
the
direct
violation,
and
the
other
act,
the
investigatory
act,
contributes
to
it,
leads
to
it
as
a
joint
activity
with
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
confusing
--
the
constitutional
injury
is
the
deprivation
of
liberty.
that's
the
injury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
causes
that
injury
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
it
is
--
the
question
is
have
you
proven
the
violation,
have
you
proven
the
injury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
does
the
use
define
the
scope
of
the
injury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
a
prosecutor
is
not
going
to
flinch
when
he
suspects
evidence
is
perjured
or
fabricated?
do
you
really
want
to
send
a
message
to
police
officers
that
they
should
not
merely
flinch
but
stop
if
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
evidence
is
fabricated?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
am
i
right
that
none
of
the
--
neither
of
the
two
prosecutors
in
this
case
were
sanctioned
in
any
way
for
their
conduct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
have
no
reason
to
dispute
the
numerous
studies
we
were
provided
that
show
that
as
a
matter
of
routine
prosecutors
are
not
sanctioned
for
improper
prosecutorial
conduct
in
the
investigatory
stage,
are
you?
