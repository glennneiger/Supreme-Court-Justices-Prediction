justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
clear
up
one
thing
for
me
i
really
don't
quite
understand.
you
do
agree
that
if
the
police
officers
did
this
there
would
be
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
assuming
that
to
be
correct
or
are
you
disputing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
that's
true,
why
doesn't
the
trial
immunize
the
police
officers
because
they
didn't
cause
the
trial?
well,
they
were
in
the
background
in
the
same
sense
that
these
prosecutors
are.
but
why
would
the
police
officers
be
liable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
to
get
immunity,
but
why
is
he
liable?
why
is
he
liable?
because
the
injury
was
caused
by
the
trial,
if
i
understand
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
not
a
malicious
prosecution.
the
prosecution
--
the
prosecutors
acted
in
good
faith
all
the
way
through,
so
there
is
no
malicious
prosecution.
so
what
is
the
basis
for
liability
against
the
police
officers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
the
theory
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
case
also?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
investigation
by
the
prosecutor
could
not
have
caused
injury
but
for
the
immunized
act
of
going
forward
with
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
at
the
time
of
introducing
the
evidence,
the
policy
concerns
that
you've
described
arise,
because
we
were
criticizing
what
he
did
before
he
introduced
the
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
he
would
know
whether
or
not
it
was
fabricated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
haven't
we
said
that
during
the
investigating
stage
their
conduct
is
subject
to
different
rules
than
during
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don't
see
the
--
i
don't
to
see
if
i
can
understand
the
reason
why
the
time
in
which
the
violation
is
completed,
namely
after
the
trial,
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
liability
for
pretrial
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
completed
at
the
trial,
but
it
began
when
the
--
the
phony
investigation
started.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
reason
the
rule
seems
perverse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
very
reason
the
rule
they're
arguing
for
seems
perverse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
about
the
pretrial
detention?
isn't
that
a
deprivation
of
liberty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
be
fourth
amendment?
why
isn't
it
fourteenth
amendment
right
on
the
nose?
they're
deprived
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
case
talked
about
the
institution
of
prosecution,
not
the
deprivation
of
liberty
during
pretrial
detention,
which
is
a
different
matter.
