justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
the
issue,
when
the
--
the
claim
is
based
on
the
evaluation
of
the
truthfulness
of
a
witness
who
eventually
testifies
at
trial,
where's
the
line
to
be
drawn
between
the
investigative
stage
and
the
prosecutorial
stage?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
concerns
me
about
your
argument
is
the
--
is
a
real
fear
that
it
will
eviscerate
imbler.
now,
maybe
you
can
convince
me
that
it
will
not
have
that
effect,
but
as
the
solicitor
general
argued
at
the
end
of
his
argument,
a
very
--
in
the
typical
criminal
case,
the
witnesses
are
not
john
q.
public
with
--
who
have
never
engaged
in
any
wrongful
activity.
a
typical
witness
is
--
well,
let's
take
the
case
of
the
prosecution
of
a
--
a
white
--
of
the
ceo
of
a
huge
corporation
for
insider
trading
or
some
other
white-collar
violation.
and
the
chief
witness
against
this
person
is,
let's
say,
the
cfo
of
this
company,
who
when
initially
questioned
by
law
enforcement
officials
and
investigatory
officials,
made
--
made
statements
denying
any
participation
in
any
wrongdoing,
but
eventually
changed
his
story
and
testifies
against
the--
ceo
at
trial
in
exchange
for
consideration
in
a
plea
deal.
now,
your
argument,
in
a
case
like
that
--
or
you
could
change
the
facts,
make
it
an
organized
crime
case,
make
it
a
prosecution
of
a
drug
kingpin
who's
testifying
--
the
witness
against
him
is
a
lower-ranking
person
in
the
organization
who
has
a
criminal
record,
maybe
has
previously
committed
perjury,
has
made
numerous
false
statements,
is
subject
to
impeachment.
in
all
of
those
cases
a
claim
could
be
brought
against
the
prosecutor.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
that
might
be
true
as
an
empirical
matter,
but
i
don't
understand
why
it
would
be
hard
to
allege.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
you
have
to
allege
to
get
by
iqbal
or
to
get
by
summary
judgment?
you
allege
that
the
testimony
at
trial
was
false
and
that
the
prosecutor
knew
that
it
was
false.
and
in
support
of
that
you
have
prior
inconsistent
statements
by
the
witness,
and
you
may
have
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
by
the
defense
at
trial
that
is
inconsistent
with
that.
you
have
a
triable
issue.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
certainly
get
by
12(b)(6).
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
difficult
to
allege
fabrication?
the
--
the
allegation
is
that
at
point
a
this
witness
denied
that
the
defendant
did
anything
wrong,
and
then
at
point
b
the
defendant
told
an
entirely
different
story
after
having
received
from
the
government
a
plea
deal
that
promises
no
prosecution
and
entry
into
the
witness
protection
program
or
something
like
that.
that
certainly
is
sufficient
evidence
to
--
of
fabrication,
is
it
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
an
entirely
false
picture
of
the
way
any
sophisticated
prosecution
is
handled
today,
completely
false.
you
want
--
the
prosecutor
may
not
know
whether
there's
probable
cause
until
the
prosecutor
interviews
the
witness.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
so
then
you
have
to
go
back
and
determine
whether
there
was
--
if
there
wasn't
probable
cause
before
the
interview,
then
there
is
liability.
but
if
there
was
probable
cause
before
the
interview,
then
there
isn't
liability.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
the
re-interview,
because
the
prosecutor
doesn't
want
to
take
the
case
to
the
grand
jury
before
looking
this
witness
in
the
eye
and
seeing
whether
this
--
this
guy
who's
got
a
lot
of
impeachment
baggage
is
--
is
a
--
is
a
credible
witness.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
--
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
would
--
would
it
be
a
--
would
it
be
practical
and
conceptually
correct
to
draw
the
line
at
the
stage
at
which
the
prosecutor
is
interviewing
witnesses
to
evaluate
credibility?
so,
at
that
stage,
the
prosecutorial
function
has
begun
and
absolute
immunity
would
kick
in.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
not
on
whether
there
is
probable
cause
because
probable
cause
is
--
is
evanescent.
it
comes,
and
it
goes.
it
is
--
it
is
--
it
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
what
the
prosecutor
is
doing
in
questioning
the
witness.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
with
a
line
toward
investigating
credibility
for
use
at
a
trial,
which
is
--
which
is,
at
that
point,
foreordained,
but,
if
the
evaluation
is
being
done
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
there
should
be
a
trial,
then,
no.
that's
your
answer?
