justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
answering
the
question
clearly.
are
both
the
prosecutor,
in
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical,
and
the
policeman
liable?
can't
you
answer
that?
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
that's
what
i
thought
your
answer
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
she's
more
concerned
about
the
prosecutor,
and
the
prosecutor,
also,
would
be
treated
just
like
a
police
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
do
you
get
the
policeman
who
has
fabricated
the
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
difference
here
is
that
the
--
the
absolutely
immune
act
which
follows
the
--
the
unlawful
act
is
--
is
an
absolutely
immune
act
by
the
very
actor
who
performed
the
earlier
act
that
--
that
you
say
induces
liability.
and
so
the
argument
is,
what's
the
use
of
giving
him
liability
later
on
if
--
if
you
can
simply
drag
him
into
litigation
by
--
by
alleging
that
he
at
an
earlier
stage
committed
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
difference.
i
mean,
to
me
that's
the
--
the
crux
of
this,
that
it
is
the
same
actor
who
has
absolute
liability
whom
you're
trying
to
get
on
the
basis
of
--
of
earlier
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
won't
be
protected.
they
won't
have
that
assurance,
because
when
they
--
when
they
produce
evidence
at
trial,
oh,
yeah,
i
guess
the
production
at
trial
will
be
protected,
but
you're
--
you're
telling
us
that
they
can
go
back
and
say,
ah,
but
you
got
that
evidence
in
a
bad
manner,
and
therefore
we
can
sue
you,
not
for
introducing
it
at
trial,
but
for
fabricating
it
before
trial.
i
--
i
don't
see
that
there
is
much
of
a
difference
as
far
as
the
deterrent
effect
upon
the
prosecutor
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
does
that
prove?
what
does
that
prove?
i
don't
understand
why
you
bring
that
up
because
it
shows
that
the
fact
that
there
aren't
many
cases,
only
17
in
the
--
in
the
second
circuit,
it
doesn't
mean
anything
because
the
second
circuit
is
not
applying
as
liberal
a
rule
as
your
opponent
suggests.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
that's
--
that's
just
what
i
said,
and,
therefore
--
and
had
it
been
applied
that
way,
there
would
have
been
more
than
17
cases
in
the
second
circuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
