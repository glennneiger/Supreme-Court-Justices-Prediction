justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
--
your
case
here
is
a
polite
way
of
telling
us
we
wasted
our
time
in
buckley
v.
fitzsimmons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
we
were
just
spinning
our
wheels
in
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
take
two
cases.
one
is
justice
ginsburg's
case,
a
police
officer
fabricates
the
evidence,
dupes
the
prosecuting
attorney,
or
--
or
doesn't
fully
disclose.
case
two,
a
prosecutor
does
the
same
thing
and
gives
it
to
a
fellow
prosecutor.
same
--
should
the
analysis
be
precisely
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
--
so
the
law
is
the
more
deeply
you're
involved
in
the
wrong,
the
more
likely
you
are
to
be
immune?
that's
a
strange
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
a
prosecutor
knows
that
it's
fabricated
evidence?
the
police
officer
fabricates
the
evidence
and
says:
mr.
prosecutor,
it's
a
very
bad
man;
i
fabricated
the
evidence.
the
prosecutor
introduces
it.
what
result
there?
see,
your
footnote
6
presumes
that
the
prosecutor
doesn't
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
he
knows?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
against
the
policeman?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
the
more
aggravated
the
tort,
the
greater
the
immunity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
basically
saying
that
you
cannot
aid
and
abet
someone
who
is
immune,
and
that's
just
not
the
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways
and
say
this
is
a
policy
we
should
take
into
account
and
then
when
justice
sotomayor
asks
you
a
question,
say:
oh,
well,
that's
for
the
legislature.
i
mean,
you're
--
it
seems
to
me
you're
trying
to
have
it
both
ways.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
--
what's
--
what's
your
best
authority
for
the
proposition
that
there's
liability
in
the
case
the
chief
justice
put?
what's
your
best
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
will
have
to
refresh
my
memory.
wasn't
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation
ultimately?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
--
so
that's
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
could
you
answer
justice
breyer's
question,
which
i
--
i
think
raises
a
--
a
critical
point
in
terms
of
justice
alito's
examples
of
talking
to
the
witness.
why
isn't
that
at
some
point
--
i
think
in
buckley,
the
"judicial
phase".
why
is
this
the
judicial
phase?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
probable
cause
doesn't
work
because
you
have
--
you
have
probable
cause
once
you
fabricate
the
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
circular.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
prosecutor
isn't
sure
there's
probable
cause
and
he
calls
--
calls
in
the
accountant,
the
cfo,
and
really
doesn't
begin
to
believe
his
story,
so
he
starts
probing
and
finally
he
gets
the
cfo
to
change
his
story
with
the
plea
--
plea
bargain.
would
that
be
part
of
the
judicial
process?
or
is
that
still
clearly
investigatory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he's
trying
to
find
out.
that's
what--
