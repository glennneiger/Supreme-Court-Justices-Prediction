chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-974,
lewis
v.
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
payton.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
under
your
position,
say
the
city
adopts
a
discriminatory
--
takes
a
--
issues
a
discriminatory
test;
people
take
it;
they
come
out
with
the
results;
the
city
says
these
--
this
is
the
test
we're
going
to
use,
but,
you
know,
we
don't
have
any
vacancies.
nobody
can
sue
at
that
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
--
each
--
each
qualified
firefighter
who
did
not
get
a
job
because
the
well-qualified
one
did
has
a
new
cause
of
action,
i
guess,
every
time
somebody
is
hired
from
the
--
the
well-qualified
pool?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
somebody
is
hired,
that
constitutes
discrimination
against
the
qualified
black
firefighter
who
was
not
hired,
and
then
another
--
then
somebody
else
is
hired
--
each
time
it's
a
new
cause
of
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
so
they
would
have
a
new
cause
of
action,
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
but
they
--
but
if
300
days
go
from
the
first
round
of
hiring,
they
don't
--
they
cannot
sort
of
piggyback
that
onto
a
later
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
get--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
everybody
gets
132
over
6,000
times
whatever
the
number
of
people
who
would
have
been
hired?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean
the
pay
for
the
number
of
people.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
suppose
the
benefit
is
not
that
the
city
knows
it's
safe
--
it
can
rely
on
a
test
and
all
that
--
but
knows
that
it
only
has
to
pay
300
days
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
solomon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
force
people
to
challenge
the
practice
when
they
don't
even
know
if
it's
going
to
affect
them.
in
the
hypothetical
that
has
been
discussed,
somebody
who
didn't
graduate
from
high
school,
you
know,
wants
to
be
something
other
than
a
firefighter.
but
that
doesn't
work
out,
and
then
he
says,
well,
now
i
want
to
be
a
firefighter.
and
they
say,
well,
you
can't,
because
you
didn't
graduate
from
high
school.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
think
your
position
is
that,
well,
he
should
have
filed
that
suit
earlier,
no?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
what
is
the
unlawful
practice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
alito's
question,
what
if
it
were
different?
what
if
the
letter
said,
look,
you
didn't
get,
you're
not
well
qualified,
but
we
really
do
expect
to
hire
a
lot
more,
so,
you
know,
keep
your
fingers
crossed.
there's
a
good
chance
that
you
are
going
to
be
hired.
and
you
say
those
people
should
have
sued
right
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
kind
of
a
bad
policy,
isn't
it?
you're
telling
people
who
may
probably
not
be
injured
at
all
--
you
are
saying,
well,
you
still
have
to
go
into
federal
court
and
sue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
sure.
no,
i
understand
that,
but,
you
know,
let's
say
we
think
we
are
going
to
hire
--
if
the
budget
plan
goes
through,
we
think
we're
going
to
hire
everybody
else
by
--
in
4
months.
and
you're
saying,
well,
those
people
have
to
sue
anyway
because
they
are
injured
by
the
4-month
delay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
got
to
--
i
mean,
you've
just
got
to
take
your
--
get
as
good
legal
advice
as
you
can
and
determine
is
it
--
are
we
going
to
be
in
more
trouble
if
we
follow
the
test
or
more
trouble
if
we
--
if
we
take
it
down?
people
have
to
do
that
all
the
time.
they
look
--
well,
if
i
do
this,
i'm
going
to
be
in
trouble;
if
i
do
this,
i'm
going
to
--
but
i
have
got
to
decide
what
i
should
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry.
read
in
conjunction
with
the
300
--
you
have
got
to
finish
that
sentence
at
least,
before--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
payton,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-974,
lewis
versus
the
city
of
chicago.
