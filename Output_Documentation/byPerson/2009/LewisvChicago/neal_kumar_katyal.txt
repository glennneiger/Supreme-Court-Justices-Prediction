mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
questions
i
think
reveal,
i
think
the
bottom
line
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
under
the
text
of
title
vii
there
was
a
present
violation
in
each
of
the
11
rounds
of
hiring
when
the
city
of
chicago
relied
on
its
concededly
discriminatory
test
to
exclude
the
plaintiffs
from
consideration.
and
we
think
that
title
vii
has
three
mutually
reinforcing
provisions
in
it,
each
of
which
point
to
the
same
conclusion.
a
violation
of
title
vii
occurred
in
this
case
when
chicago,
in
each
of
those
11
rounds,
used
its
hiring
practice
with
--
and
caused
a
disparate
impact,
thereby
limiting
the
employment
opportunities
of
certain
applicants.
chicago
gave
an
ability
test
and
relied
on
that
ability
test
in
a
way
that
title
vii
forbids.
it
took
action
upon
the
results
of
that
discriminatory
test
in
a
way
that
arbitrarily
excluded
qualified
applicants
from
being
hired.
justice
alito,
i
think
--
in
response
to
your
question,
i
think
our
position
follows
entirely
from
the
text
of
the
statute.
we're
not
as
concerned
about
the
policy
consequences,
though
we
do
think
that
if
the
court
were
concerned
about
the
policy
consequences,
we
think
that
there's
a
good
reason
why
congress
distinguished
between
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
litigation.
but
it's
the
language
of
title
vii
itself,
and
in
particular
703(h),
which
forbids
action
upon
the
results.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
agree
that
there
--
there
might
be
policy
arguments
against
it
as
well
as
for
it,
but
here's
the
way
i
think
we
look
at
it
--
and
the
united
states
is
the
nation's
largest
employer,
and
we
face
similar
concerns.
we
give
certain
tests.
but
i
think
what
might
have
been
--
what
was
probably
animating
congress
was
a
fear
that
if
the
rule
of
the
city
of
chicago
were
adopted,
then
an
employer
who
made
it
300
days
without
an
eeoc
charge
being
filed,
300
days
after
the
announcement
of
the
test
results,
would
then
be
able
to
for
all
time
use
that
discriminatory
test,
and
it
would
lock
in
that
period,
that
test,
for
as
long
as
10,
20
years,
and
congress
could
have
legitimately
worried
about
if
a
test
made
it
300
days,
an
employer
essentially
had
a
get-out-of-jail
--
free
card
to
use
for
all
time.
and
i
would
say
that
that
precise
thing
appears
to
have
happened
in
this
very
case.
at
joint
appendix
page
54,
when
the
city
announced
its
test
results
in
january
of
1996,
it
said
it
intended
to
use
this
test
for
only
3
years
through
1999.
afterwards,
1999
came,
the
city,
in
the
city's
own
briefs
--
this
is
the
court
of
appeals
brief
at
page
12
--
they
admit
they
made
a
new
decision
to
continue
using
this
test
and
the
test
results
for
subsequent
hiring
rounds.
that
was
a
new
decision,
and
indeed
that's
a
decision,
i
think,
many
employers
would
logically
make
after
3
years,
because
then
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
possibility
of
a
disparate
impact
lawsuit.
and
since,
as
this
court
said
in
ricci,
one
of
the
goals
of
title
vii
is
really
to
encourage
voluntary
compliance
on
the
part
of
employers,
adopting
a
rule
like
the
city
of
chicago's
is
really
antithetical
to
that,
because
then
it
will
essentially
lock
in
for
all
time
that
old
discriminatory
test.
i
think
another
reason
policy
--
another
policy
reason
congress
may
have
thought
about
is
that
a
rule
that
forced
people
to
file
within
300
days
might
be
damaging
to
the
eeoc
and
divisive
to
employers,
because
it
would
say
you
only
have
that
300-day
period
to
file,
even
before
all
the
consequences
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
employment
decision
are
fully
understood.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
first
charge
was
filed,
i
believe,
420
days
after
the
january
26th
announcement
of
the
test
results.
and,
yes,
justice
kennedy,
then
there
was
a
period
of
discovery
and
litigation
over
business
necessity
and
the
like.
and
in
this
case,
the
city
admitted
in
other
litigation
that
there
was
no
basis
for
giving
this
89
cutoff
score,
that
a
person
who
scored
65
was
just
as
likely
to
succeed
as
a
firefighter
as
a
person
who
was
--
who
had
scored
89.
justice
stevens,
you
had
asked
about
the
remedy
in
the
case,
and
here's
how
we
understand
the
way
remedies
work
in
disparate
impact
litigation:
it's
largely
injunctive
in
nature.
it's
mostly
about
preventing
future
problems.
there
is
a
back
pay
claim
that
is
available
that
is
statutorily
capped
at
2
years.
not
everyone
in
this
6,000-person
class
could
get
that
full
amount
of
back
pay
obviously.
instead,
what
happened
here,
there
was
a
remedial
phase
at
trial,
and
what
they
did
was
they
decided
that
--
the
experts
on
both
sides
admitted
that
132
people,
approximately,
would
have
been
hired
out
of
that
class,
and
that
provided
the
appropriate
amount
of
back
pay.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
it
was
132
undifferentiated
people,
and
then
i
think
there
--
and
mr.
payton
can,
i
think,
fully
explain
how
the
randomization
of
awards
was
allocated.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--right.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
respond
to
your
concern
before,
that
amount
of
money
is
not
--
you
couldn't
go
back
and
look
to
earlier
periods
of
time
outside
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
outside
of
the
300-day
period,
rather
only
any
subsequent
use.
for
example,
in
this
case
the
remedy
couldn't
look
to
the
first
round
of
hiring
because
no
lawsuit
was
brought
within
that
first
round
of
hiring.
it
was
brought
at
the
--
it
was
brought
after
the
second
round
of
hiring.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
correct.
and
i
think
that
the
petitioners
agree
with
that
as
well.
and
that's
i
think
a
further
limit
on
the
way
in
which
this
present
violation
theory
operates
as
a
matter
of
practice.
now,
this
court
has
said
in
cases
such
as
ledbetter
that
--
that
there
must
be
a
present
violation,
and
disparate
impact
litigation
looks
quite
different
than
disparate
treatment
litigation
in
practice,
because
disparate
impact
litigation
doesn't
need
that
missing
element
that
has
been
at
issue
in
ledbetter
and
evans
and
ricks,
of
discriminatory
intent
at
that
subsequent
time
of
action.
here,
in
a
disparate
impact
case,
all
that
need
be
shown
by
the
plaintiff
is
adverse
impact,
and
that
adverse
impact
happens
in
each
of
those
11
rounds
of
hiring.
each
of
the
time
--
each
time
the
city
used
its
test
results
and
drew
a
line
and
said,
you
under
89,
we
are
not
looking
at
you,
that
was
action
upon
the
results,
to
use
the
language
of
(h)(2).
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
exactly
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
let
me
say
two
things:
first
is
i
think
(h)(2)
refers
to
10
years
is
itself
action
upon
the
results,
and
so
i
think
as
a
statutory
matter
the
language
decides
it.
now,
with
respect
to
the
policy
reason,
i
think
the
reason
is
that
otherwise
congress
had
to
fear
precisely
what
you're
saying,
that
an
employer
10
years
from
now
would
use
that
discriminatory
test,
because
they
knew
they
had
made
it
past
the
300-day
initial
phase
of
time,
and
then
could
use
it
for
all
time.
and
so
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
concerns
about
repose
work
hand
in
hand
with
other
concerns
of
title
vii,
and
in
particular
incentivizing
employers
to
ensure
voluntary
compliance
with
the
law
of
title
vii,
and
which
this
court
said
in
griggs,
the
goal
of
which
is
to
eradicate
discrimination
from
the
united
states'
labor
markets.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
--
that
is
--
that
is
the
benefit
of
that
particular
back
pay
limitation,
yes.
but
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
city
knows
very
well,
this
test
is
discriminatory
and,
indeed,
has
said
so
in
litigation,
i
think
congress
wanted
to
incentivize
and
make
sure
there
was
an
ability
for
people
to
sue
at
each
time
that
discriminatory
test
was
used.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
