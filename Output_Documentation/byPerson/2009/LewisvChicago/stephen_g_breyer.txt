how
is
it
absent?
because
the
statute
says
that
the
established
--
the
--
it's
established
--
namely,
the
unlawful
employment
practice
--
it's
established
only
if,
and
certainly
if,
the
respondent
uses--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
particular
employment
practice
that
has
a
disparate
impact.
that
refers
back
to
(a)(2).
so
back
in
that
period,
on
a
certain
date,
he
used
that
limiting
practice,
and,
therefore,
on
that
particular
date,
he
established
the
unlawful
employment
practice
by
using
a
test
that
limited,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
my
impression
--
is
there
anything
else
in
that
(k)?
you
see,
it
lists
about
10
things,
let's
say
10
--
imagine.
one
of
those
things
is
that
it
was
used.
now,
all
the
other
things
there
will
not
have
been
--
are
things
that
--
that
--
to
do
with
the
test,
basically.
so
you
have
like
six
or
seven
that
have
to
do
with
the
test
and
the
criteria,
and
then
you
have
one
that
it
was
used.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
so
i
thought,
looking
at
the
list,
it's
quite
right
that
it's
used
for
a
different
purpose
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but,
i
mean,
this
(k)
has
to
do
with
a
different
thing,
but
--
but
--
and
the
critical
element
of
it
was
that
the
practice
be
used.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you'd
have
to
then
say
that
all
the
things
that
are
there,
the
other
nine
and
so
forth
--
all
those
nine
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
well,
that's
true
--
it
does--
