justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
the
language
of
the
statute
of
703
is
to
"limit,
segregate,
or
classify.
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
it
your
position
that
the
violation
occurs
at
the
classification
that's
announced
and
that
every
subsequent
hiring
has
limited
someone's
opportunity
so
that
they
--
there's
a
violation
subsequently
under
the
limit
clause
as
opposed
to
the
classification
clause,
or
it's
each
event
is
a
classification
violation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
don't
we
look
at
subsection
(h)--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
says
--
and
it's
an
--
"it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
give
and.
"
--conjunctive
--
"and
act
upon
the
results".
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
when
you
hire,
aren't
you
acting
upon
the
results?
and
how
are
you
acting
upon
--
you
may
be
acting
upon
it,
as
petitioner
argues,
when
you
classify,
but
why
aren't
you
acting
upon
when
you
hire?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
point.
isn't
it,
in
the
very
act
of
hiring,
you
are
using
the
test
results
and
saying
--
each
time
you
do
it,
you're
saying:
i'm
going
to
cut
off
at
this
limit,
and
i'm
not
going
to
consider
someone
outside
of
this
limited
tier.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
that
what
"practice
and
policy"
means?
meaning
that
each
time,
as
you
continue
forward,
you
are
using
a
particular
practice,
a
particular
policy?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
could
you
answer
justice
stevens's
hypothetical?
what
is
the
difference
between
those
people
and
each
person
who
does
not
have
a
high
school
diploma
is
not
--
and
is
not
hired?
does
that
mean
that
the
moment
that
they
announce
the
high
school
diploma
requirement,
that
everybody
who
had
already
received
one,
whether
they
wanted
to
work
at
this
job
or
not,
had
to
sue,
and
it's
only
those
people
who
just
received
the
high
school
diploma
who
can
sue
10
years
later?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
is
the
difference
between
the
policy
announcement
that
each
time
i
hire,
i'm
not
going
to
use
a
high
school
--
i'm
not
going
to
look
at
people
who
don't
have
a
high
school
diploma,
and
i'm
not
going
to
look
at
people
who
don't
have
a
test
score
above
89.
what's
the
difference
between
those?
