justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
position
may
--
may
follow
from
the
language
of
title
vii,
but
you
began
by
saying
that
it
also
represents
the
best
policy.
and
i
wonder
if
you
could
explain
why
that
is
so.
here,
the
city
of
chicago
continued
to
use
this
test
for
quite
a
number
of
years
after
it
was
administered.
and
so
as
you
interpret
the
statute,
i
gather
that
someone
could
still
file
a
disparate
impact
claim
6
or
7
years
after
the
test
was
first
administered,
and
quite
a
few
years
after
it
was
first
used
in
making
a
hiring
decision.
and
how
can
that
be
squared
with
congress's
evident
desire
in
title
vii
to
require
that
an
eeoc
charge
be
filed
rather
promptly
after
the
employment
action
is
taken?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
allow
a
question
like
this
to
be
left
open
for
such
an
extended
period
of
time?
why
would
it
not
have
wanted
everybody
who
is
potentially
affected
by
it
to
understand
where
things
stand
at
a
much
earlier
point,
at
some
reasonable
period
of
time
after
all
of
the
information
is
in
the
--
in
the
possession
of
a
potential
plaintiff
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
disparate
impact
and
whether
that
--
that
person
is
going
to
be
adversely
affected
by
it,
particularly
if
at
a
later
point
the
effect
of
a
remedial
decree
can
be
to
upset
the
employment
--
the
employment
status
of
other
people
who
have
been
hired
in
the
interim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
somebody
getting
--
someone
getting
a
letter
that
you
sent
to
people
who
were
qualified
didn't
know
that.
the
only
thing
that
i
see
that
you
sent
to
the
people
who
fell
into
the
qualified
category
was
that
it
was
unlikely,
which
i
take
it
means
less
than
50
percent,
that
they
would
be
called
for
further
processing,
but
it
was
possible
that
they
would
be
called
for
further
processing.
you
didn't
tell
them
anything
about
--
you
didn't
tell
them
that
you
were
going
to
fill
all
of
your
available
positions
with
people
who
were
classified
as
well
qualified
in
that
letter--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--did
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
that's
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
did
the
city
say
that
it
was
planning
to
give
a
new
test
in
3
years
and
then
wait
more
than
a
decade
before
giving
a
new
test?
if
i
received
one
of
these
qualified
letters,
and
i
also
--
and
i
knew
in
addition
that
the
city
was
going
to
give
a
test
in
3
years,
that
might
well
affect
my
incentive
about
bringing
a
lawsuit
to
challenge
this.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
don't
challenge
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
challenge
that.
you
now
acknowledge
that
the
plaintiffs
were
treated
unlawfully.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
were
you
prejudiced
by
the
delay
in
the
filing
of
the
eeoc
charge?
