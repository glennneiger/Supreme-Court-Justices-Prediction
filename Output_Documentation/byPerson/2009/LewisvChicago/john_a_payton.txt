mr.
john
a.
payton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
11
separate
occasions,
chicago
used
an
unlawful
cutoff
score
to
determine
which
applicants
it
would
hire
as
firefighters.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
cutoff
score
had
an
adverse
impact
on
qualified
black
applicants
and
was
not
job-related.
the
only
question
presented
is
whether
each
use
of
the
cutoff
score
in
each
of
the
hiring
rounds
was
a
separate
violation
of
title
vii.
an
affirmative
answer
to
that
question
is
both
the
best
reading
of
the
statute
and
the
soundest
policy.
section
703(k)
of
title
vii
provides
that
in
a
disparate
impact
case,
as
this
case,
an
unlawful
employment
practice
is
established
--
those
are
the
words
--
"is
established"
when,
quote,
"a
respondent
uses
an
employment
practice
that
causes
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
race.
"
close
quote.
section
703(h)
states
that,
quote,
"a
test,
its
application,
and
action
upon
the
results.
"
close
quote,
are
each
violations
of
title
vii
if
they
are,
quote,
"used
to
discriminate",
close
quote.
section
703(a)(2)
prohibits
racially
discriminatory
classifications.
mr.
john
a.
payton
no,
no.
our
position
is
that
in
fact
there
was
an
additional
violation
when
the
classification
occurred
when
the
city
announced
what
it
intended
to
do
in
the
future.
that's
also
a
violation.
but
if
i
can
make
the
contrast,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
the
city
--
suppose
they
didn't
announce
anything
at
all,
and
what
they
did
was
in
all
those
occasions,
the
11
i
just
described
--
they
used
the
unlawful
cutoff
score
and
made
hiring
decisions.
title
vii's
disparate
impact
looks
at
the
consequences
of
decisions
like
that.
and
those
consequences,
the
results
of
that
clearly
occur
in
the
future
on
those
11
hiring
occasions,
and
then
we
would
clearly
have
a
cause
of
action
on
each
of
those
11
times.
now,
i'll
come
back
and
say
that
chicago
announces,
before
it
does
any
of
that,
that
it
intends
to
do
that
in
the
future.
that
announcement
is
an
independent
violation,
but
that
announcement
does
not
change
the
impact
and
the
consequences
that
in
fact
still
would
happen
in
the
future
when
they
happen.
mr.
john
a.
payton
well,
there
is
an
impact.
you
mean
when
the
announcement
is
made?
mr.
john
a.
payton
when
the
announcement
is
made
--
let
me
make
two
points:
first
of
all,
i
believe
we
--
you
could
clearly
seek
to
enjoin
chicago
from
doing
something
unlawful
in
the
future--
mr.
john
a.
payton
--as
you
clearly
have
a
cause
of
action
at
the
announcement.
we
know
that.
mr.
john
a.
payton
because
an
impending
violation--
mr.
john
a.
payton
--yes.
and
the
question
whether
or
not
the
announcement
itself
is
in
violation
of
the
statute,
i
believe
section
703(a)(2)
and,
actually,
all
three
provisions,
make
it
unlawful
to
actually
have
a
classification
that
has
the
effects
i
just
said,
and
the
effects
would
simply
be
in
how
they
were
sorting
the
results.
so
i
think
there
is
an
impact.
it's
not
the
same
impact
that
ripples
through
time.
and
the
reason
i
said,
if
they
had
not
made
an
announcement
it's
clear
there
are
consequences
that
happen
in
the
future
each
of
those
11
times,
there's
an
additional
violation
when
they
actually
use
the
announcement
to
say
what
they
intend
to
do.
they
say
what
they
intend
to
do,
and
then
they
do
it.
those
are
two
different
violations.
mr.
john
a.
payton
yes.
mr.
john
a.
payton
it's
our
position
that,
in
fact,
all
three
of
the
sections
i
quoted
from
are
implicated
in
the
actions
that
chicago
took.
clearly,
there's
a
classification,
but
when
they
actually
exclude
from
actual
consideration
for
any
of
the
jobs
on
the
11
occasions,
that's
a
limitation.
it's
clearly
a
limitation.
when
they
use
the
test
results,
that's
an
action
upon
the
test
results.
when
they
use
that
to
make
decisions,
that's
clearly
a
violation
of
(k).
all
three
provisions
are
in
fact
implicated,
sometimes
in
similar
ways,
sometimes
in
different
ways.
all
of
them
have
consequences.
and
the
way
disparate
impact
law
works
is,
you
have
an
employment
practice
--
it's
always
facially
neutral
--
that
has
an
adverse
impact
on
the
basis
of
race
that
causes
there
to
be
a
disparate
impact
and
consequences.
we
look
at
consequences,
and
the
elements
of
the
disparate
impact
violation
are
not
complete
until
we
have
all
of
those
elements.
mr.
john
a.
payton
i
think
the
answer
is
that
this
is
completely
consistent
with
how
the
statute
works,
but
i'm
going
to
address
the
policy
concern
as
well.
but
how
the
statute
works
is,
there's
a
violation
every
time
there's
a
use.
if
we
looked
at
disparate
treatment,
there's
a
violation
every
time
there's
an
intention
to
discriminate.
if
there
was
a
future
intention
to
discriminate,
there
would
be
a
new
violation.
so
if
there
is
a
next
use,
there's
a
next
violation.
and
that's
how
that
ought
to
work.
but
look
at
how
this
worked.
chicago
used
an
unlawful
cutoff
score
on
those
11
occasions
to
make
decisions.
chicago
should
have
stopped
using
the
discriminatory
cutoff
score,
and
it
should
have
looked
at
all
of
the
qualified
applicants
that
it
had
judged
qualified
in
making
its
decisions.
mr.
john
a.
payton
i
actually
think
that
that
conflict
is
not
present.
chicago
can
always
make
a
decision
that
responds
to
something
that
was
unlawful.
and
i
think
this
court
has
always
made
it
clear
the
standard
may
be
in
ricci,
but
the
law
is
clearly
that
if
chicago
has
reason
to
believe
--
very
good
reason
to
believe
that
it
is
doing
something
that
is
unlawful,
it
can
stop
doing
something
unlawful.
that's
especially
the
case
here.
mr.
john
a.
payton
i
understand.
the
standard
that
may
apply
to
chicago's
decision
may
be
different,
but
let
me
give
you
the
example
in
this
case.
chicago
used
a
cutoff
score
that
the
district
court
finds
and
that
their
expert
who
designed
the
test
told
them
was
problematic,
to
make
decisions
that
has
nothing
job-related
about
it
at
all.
it's
arbitrary.
the
group
that
are
qualified
are
as
qualified
as
the
group
that
are
well
qualified
and
vice
versa.
they
had
available
to
them
the
option
of
picking
randomly
from
that
group,
both
groups
combined,
and
making
the
decisions
on
a
random
draw.
that
is,
in
fact,
how
they
made
all
of
the
decisions
inside
of
the
groups
that
they
used.
that's
always
available.
chicago
could
have
done
that
at
any
time.
the
policy
point
here,
justice
alito,
is
that
--
i'd
say
the
animating
purpose
behind
title
vii
is,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
eradication
of
discrimination
from
our
workplace.
and
you
want
it
to
be
eradicated.
chicago
should
not
have
continued
doing
this.
and
the
law
ought
to
say,
and
i
think
it
does
say,
that
when
they
use
something
that
is
unlawful,
they
can
be
challenged
every
time
they
use
something
that
is
unlawful.
if
the--
mr.
john
a.
payton
--let
me
give
you
two
responses
to
that.
the
first
answer
is
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
300
days
after
every
use,
and
it's
no
longer.
so
for
whatever
it
is,
if
you
violate
title
vii,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
300
days.
if
there
is
a
use
that
goes
into
the
future,
it's
300
days
after
the
last
use.
right
now,
chicago
has
stopped
using
that.
the
doors
are
closed.
no
one
else
can
challenge
this.
to
your
specific
question
about
how
would
it
work
if
there
was
a
layoff
arrangement,
the
proposed
--
the
remedy
order
in
this
case
--
it's
not
in
effect
because
we
are
where
we
are
--
but
the
remedy
order
in
this
case
includes
shutting
down
the
use
of
this,
but
it
also
has
provisions
for
seniority
to
in
fact
address,
i
believe,
exactly
the
circumstances
you
just
described,
justice
ginsburg.
so
i
believe
that
is
contemplated
and
handled
in
the
remedial
order.
the
issue
about
the
policy
here,
though,
is
that
if
you
don't
say
that
a
use,
in
fact,
can
be
challenged,
a
use
of
something
unlawful
can
be
challenged,
what
you
could
end
up
with
here
is
that
chicago
would
then
take
the
message
that
it's
okay
once
they
are
past
the
first
300
days,
and
they
could
just
go
on
using
the
discriminatory
cutoff
score
over
and
over
and
over
again,
and
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
overall
policy
of
what
title
vii
is
trying
to
root
out
of
our
economy
and
in
our
workplace.
mr.
john
a.
payton
the
group
of
the
black
qualified
applicants
that
are
in
the
qualified
category,
but
the
qualified
category
is
qualified
as
the
other
category
--
every
time
the
city
made
decisions
about
filling
jobs
in
the
fire
department,
it
excluded
every
single
one
of
those
applicants,
even
though
they
were
qualified.
so
every
single
one
was
excluded.
so
they
all
have
a
cause
of
action
because
they
were
excluded
and
that
clearly
fits
very
easily
within
how--
mr.
john
a.
payton
--no.
that's
correct.
that's
about
what
the
remedy
would
be.
so
the
remedy
and
--
you
know,
obviously
wouldn't
be
to
give
all
of
them
jobs.
that's
not
the
remedy,
and
that
wasn't
the
remedy
that's
sought
--
was
sought
here.
but
they
were
all
excluded
from
consideration,
and
that's
a
violation
of
title
vii's
disparate
impact
prohibition.
so
they
all
have
a
cause
of
action.
the
way
the
remedy
would
work--
mr.
john
a.
payton
--it
may
be
very
little.
so
if
it's
a
single
applicant
who
sues
and
not
a
class
--
this
is
a
class.
so
if
a
single
applicant
sues,
the
remedy
would
be
to
stop
using
the
unlawful
cutoff
score,
okay,
and
then
to
figure
out
what
would
have
happened
if
that
unlawful
cutoff
score
hadn't
have
occurred,
and
that
would
have
created
a
very
miniscule
chance
of
ever
becoming
a
firefighter
and
perhaps
turning
that
into
some
sort
of
damage
award,
but
it
would
be
miniscule.
in
the
actual
event,
the
award
includes
some
actual
jobs
being
allocated
to
the
6,000
members
of
the
class
--
it
was
132
--
to
be
decided
upon
in
some
random
way
that
they
would
be
hired.
but
that's
how
it
would
work.
but
they
are
all
clearly
injured
when
they
are
all
excluded
from
consideration
in
all
11
rounds,
in
violation
of
title
vii.
mr.
john
a.
payton
every
time--
mr.
john
a.
payton
--they
had
11
rounds
of
hiring--
mr.
john
a.
payton
--that
are
relevant
to
this
case.
there
are
other
rounds
afterwards.
they
exhaust
the
first
category.
but
in
the
11
rounds
of
hiring,
when
in
every
one
of
those
rounds
the
unlawful
cutoff
score
is
used,
that
is
action
upon
the
results.
that
is
a
limitation.
you
know,
that
is
the
use
of
something
that
causes
an
adverse
impact
on
the
basis
of
race
--
and,
yes--
mr.
john
a.
payton
--that's
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
a.
payton
yes,
if
they
sue
--
in
this
case,
the
eeoc
charge
was
filed
after
the
second
round
of
hiring,
and
in
this
case
then,
therefore,
no
remedy
can
take
account
of
the
first
round
of
hiring.
if
they
had
sued
only
on
the
seventh
round
of
hiring,
no
remedy
could
take
account
of
those
forgone
opportunities.
so,
that
would
also
play
out
in
how
the
remedial
order
would
work.
and
i
think
i
want
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
john
a.
payton
thank
you.
this
is
a
case
about
jobs.
and
i
want
to
read
from
the
letter
that
justice
alito
was
referring
to.
this
is
the
letter
that
the
qualifieds
received.
it's
in
our
joint
appendix
at
ja-35,
and
it's
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph.
this
is
the
letter
that
they
all
got.
this
is
the
letter
that
arthur
lewis,
the
named
person
in
the
case,
got.
however,
it
says:
you
are
qualified;
you
are
qualified;
there
are
well-qualifieds.
and
it's
unlikely
--
that
language
is
there.
and
then
it
says:
"however,
because
it
is
not
possible
at
this
time
to
predict
how
many
applicants
will
be
hired
in
the
next
few
years,
your
name
will
be
kept
on
the
eligible
list
maintained
by
the
department
of
personnel
for
as
long
as
that
list
is
used.
"
i
did
focus
on
the
word
"used".
and
it's
not
only
in
section
(k).
it's
also
in
section
(h),
where
it
says,
"used
to
discriminate".
because
it's
an
ordinary
word
that
the
city
used
itself
in
advising
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
in
the
answer
to
the
complaint
in
this
case,
which
is
at
joint
appendix
19,
the
--
i'm
sorry,
joint
appendix
16,
the
answer
to
--
actually,
the
first
paragraph
in
the
complaint
in
this
case,
the
city
says
as
follows
--
this
is
the
second
sentence
in
the
answer
to
the
complaint:
"defendant"
--
the
city
--
"admits
that
it
has
used
and
continues
to
use
results
of
the
1995
firefighter
entrance
examination
as
part
of
its
firefighter
hiring
process.
"
using
an
unlawful
cutoff
score
--
and
the
eligibility
list
is
nothing
other
than
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
cutoff
score
--
using
that
to
make
decisions
on
those
11
times
is
a
violation
of
title
vii.
and
the
argument
that
there
is
no
additional
impact
--
it
is
the
dramatic
difference
between
being
told
what
someone
intends
to
do
and
then
they
do
it.
you
are
told
that
maybe
your
chances
are
going
to
be
minimal
in
the
future,
or
maybe
50/50,
but
then
when
it
actually
starts
happening
and
you
see
other
people
start
getting
jobs,
that's
an
impact.
that's
a
consequence.
when
i
said
the
animating
principle
in
title
vii
and
disparate
impact
is
result
and
consequences,
it's
results
and
consequences.
those
are
additional
impacts
that
go
with
the
additional
uses
that
clearly
establish
a
violation
of
title
vii's
disparate
impact
prohibition
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
that
the
statutory
language
is
actually
--
i
think
the
best
reading,
as
i
said,
of
the
statutory
language
is
as
i
said.
i
think
the
policies
behind
how
that
works
--
it
is
300
days
after
every
use.
there
is
a
statute,
but,
in
fact,
the
control
over
that
is
entirely
within
the
city.
if
they
stopped
using
this
unlawful
cutoff
score
after
300
days,
they
are
completely
done
with
any
potential
liability.
and
the
point
is
you
want
that
to
be
challenged,
because
we
don't
want
unlawful
employment
practices
to
continue
to
go
forever
and
ever
and
ever
and
ever
out
there.
and
we
can
see,
in
this
very
case,
that
if
you
don't
allow
the
challenge,
the
practice
goes
on
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
--
i'd
say
the
national
policy
to
rid
our
workplace
of
discrimination.
are
there
any
other
questions
otherwise?
