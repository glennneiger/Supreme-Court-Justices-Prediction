mr.
payton,
can
i
ask
this
general
question?
am
i
correct
that
each
firefighter
in
the
qualified
group
who
did
not
make
the
well-qualified
has
a
cause
of
action
as
though
he
had
been
refused
employment
when
anyone
else
is
hired?
there
were
11
people
hired,
as
i
understand.
did
each
one
of
those
hirings
give
everybody
else
in
the
class
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
surely
they
couldn't
all
recover,
because
there
was
only
one
job
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
--
what
is
the
remedy
other
than
saying
change
your
practice?
what
is
--
say
one
person
sues
and
asks
for
damages,
what
would
the
remedy
be
for
a
single
applicant
who
was
not
hired
at
the
time
somebody
else
was
hired?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
ms.
solomon?
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
the
practice
in
this
case
were
--
required
a
high
school
diploma?
did
you
understand
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
the
practice
were
a
high
school
diploma.
could
that
--
would
you
make
the
same
argument
as
you're
making
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
--
but
in
my
example,
everybody
who
is
not
a
high
school
graduate
would
have
been
affected
right
away.
