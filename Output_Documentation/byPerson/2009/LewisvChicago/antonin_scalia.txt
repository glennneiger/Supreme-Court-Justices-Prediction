there's
an
independent
violation
without
an
impact?
i
mean,
it's
not
the
impact
provision
that
you
quoted
which
makes
that
a
violation.
it
must
be
some
other
provision
that
makes
it
a
violation.
what
other
provision
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
because
of
an
impending
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
--
you
say
it
is
an
actual
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
be
clear
even
though
it
had
not
been
established
much
earlier
that
the
test
was
invalid.
so
a
city
could
go
along
using
a
test
that
was
an
invalid
test,
not
declared
such;
10
years
later,
somebody
comes
up
and
says:
this
test
that
is
being
applied
to
me
is
an
invalid
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
of
what
use
is
a
statute
of
limitations
that
--
that
--
that
operates
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
--
the
problem
i
have
with
all
of
this
--
it
makes
entire
sense,
except
when
you
read
subpart
(k),
it
says
"an
unlawful
employment
practice
based
on
disparate
impact
is
established.
"
if
"a
complaining
party
demonstrates
that
a
respondent
uses
a
particular
employment
practice
that
causes
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of

which
is
what
happened
here.

where
does

to

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
1995,
the
city
of
chicago,
the
respondent
here
administered
a
written
examination
of
some
26,000
applicants
seeking
to
service
firefighters.
in
january
1996,
the
city
announced
that
it
would
begin
growing
randomly
from
the
top
tier
of
those
who
scored
in
this
test,
those
who
scored
at
least
89
out
of
a
possible
100
in
the
city
called
well-qualified.
in
january
1996
the
city
announced
that
it
would
begin
drawing
from
that
group.
the
city
informed
those
applicants
whom
it
selected
would
move
on
to
the
next
phase
of
the
selection
process.
the
city
informed
those
who
scored
below
65
that
they
had
failed
the
examination
and
would
not
be
considered
for
firefighter
positions.
the
applicants
in
the
middle,
those
who
scored
between
65
and
88,
in
the
city
called
qualified,
were
informed
by
letter
that
they
had
passed
the
examination
but
that
given
the
number
of
well-qualified
applicants,
it
was
not
likely
they
would
be
called
for
further
process.
the
letters
added
however
that
because
it
was
not
possible
to
predict
how
many
applicants
the
city
would
hire
in
the
next
few
years,
the
city
would
keep
each
qualified
applicants
name
on
the
list
of
eligible
applicants
as
long
as
it
used
that
list.
in
may
1996,
the
city
selected
its
first
class
of
applicants
to
advance,
draw
another
class
in
october
of
that
year
and
filled
nine
more
classes
over
the
next
few
years.
each
time
drawing
randomly
from
the
pool
of
well-qualified
candidates,
in
the
last
round
it
had
exhausted
that
pool
so
it
filled
the
remaining
slots
with
qualified
applicants.
beginning
in
march
1997,
crawford
smith
and
several
other
african-american
applicants
who
scored
in
the
qualified
range
and
had
not
been
hired
as
firefighters,
filed
charges
of
discrimination
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
the
eeoc
issued
right
to
sue
letters
and
they
filed
this
suit
against
the
city,
alleging
as
relevant
here
that
the
city's
practice
of
selecting
only
those
who
scored
89
or
above
on
the
examination
to
advance
in
the
hiring
process
caused
a
disparate
impact
on
african-americans
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
district
court
certified
a
class,
petitioners
here
consisting
of
the
6000
plus
african-americans
who
scored
in
the
qualified
range
but
had
not
been
hired.
the
city
sought
summary
judgment
asserting
that
the
class
member's
claims
were
time
barred
because
they
had
not
filed
eeoc
charges
within
300
days
of
when
their
claims
accrued
which
the
city
claimed
was
when
the
city
scored
the
examinations
and
announced
the
results
in
january
1996.
the
district
court
denied
that
motion
and
after
a
bench
trial,
it
ruled
for
petitioners
awarding
back
pay
and
ordering
the
city
to
hire
132
class
members
reflecting
the
number
it
would
have
hired
but
for
its
cut
off
score.
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
holding
that
petitioner's
claims
were
time
barred.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
before
filing
a
title
vii,
suit
a
plaintiff
must
first
file
a
timely
eeoc
charge.
all
agree
that
petitioner’s
charges
were
due
within
300
days
“after
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
occurred"
that's
the
language
in
the
statute.
aside
from
the
first
round
of
selection
in
may
of
1996
which
everyone
agrees
is
off
the
table,
no
one
disputes
that
the
conduct
petitioners
challenge
mainly
the
selection
of
firefighting
candidates
on
the
basis
of
the
rankings
announced
after
the
1995
tests
occurred
within
the
charging
period.
the
question
is
not
whether
petitioners
claim
concerning
that
conduct
is
timely
but
whether
that
claim
can
be
brought
at
all,
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion
we
conclude
that
it
can,
the
key
provision
42
usc
section
2000e-2k1ai,
i'll
call
it,
the
statute,
states
in
pertinent
part
that
“an
unlawful
employment
practice
based
on
disparate
impact
is
established
under
this
subchapter
only
if
a
complaining
party
demonstrates
that
a
respondent
uses
a
particular
employment
practice
that
causes
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex
or
national
origin”.
petitioners
claim
satisfies
this
requirement,
the
term
employment
practice
clearly
encompasses
the
conduct
petitioners
challenge
namely
the
exclusion
of
passing
applicants
who
scored
below
89,
when
selecting
those
with
advanced
and
the
city
used
which
is
the
statutory
language,
used
that
practice
in
each
round
of
selection
and
petitioners
alleged
that
this
exclusion
caused
a
disparate
impact
whether
they
prove
those
elements
is
not
before
us,
what
matters
is
that
their
allegations
stated
a
cognizable
claim.
the
city
argues
that
the
only
unlawful
employment
practice
here
was
its
creation
in
january
1996
of
the
list
of
eligible
applicants.
it
concedes
that,
that
action
was
unlawful
and
in
light
of
the
findings
of
the
court
below
but
claims
that,
that
cannot
be
the
basis
for
liability
now
because
no
timely
charge
challenging
it
was
filed
within
300
days
and
since
the
city
claims
the
exclusion
of
petitioners
in
the
subsequent
rounds
of
selection
followed
inevitably
from
the
adoption
of
the
89
point
cutoff
score
no
new
violations
could
have
occurred.
this
is
the
line
of
reasoning
adopted
by
the
seventh
circuit,
we
do
not
agree
with
it.
the
city
is
correct
that
if
the
adoption
of
the
cut
off
score
in
1996
gave
rise
to
a
freestanding
claim
of
discrimination,
petitioners
waited
too
long
to
bring
such
a
claim
but
it
does
not
follow
that
no
new
violation
could
occur
when
the
city
implemented
that
decision
down
the
road.
if
petitioners
could
prove
the
elements
of
a
disparate
impact
claim
based
on
the
implementation
of
the
cut
off,
they
could
prevail.
the
city
argues
that
a
line
of
our
cases
beginning
with
the
united
air
lines
versus
evans
forbids
liability
for
the
later
consequences
of
an
earlier
violation
of
title
vii
that
is
beyond
the
limitations
period
but
all
those
cases
--
but
all
of
those
cases
established
is
that
a
title
vii
plaintiff
must
show
a
present
violation
inside
the
limitations
period.
in
the
disparate
treatment
cases
the
city
cites
discriminatory
intent
existed
at
the
time
of
the
earlier
violation
but
did
not
exist
when
the
consequences
of
that
earlier
violation,
here
the
application
of
the
announced
test
results
were
felt.
for
disparate
impact
claims
such
as
this
one
however,
discriminatory
intent
is
not
required.
the
uses
of
the
test
that
allegedly
had
discriminatory
impact
occurred
within
the
300
day
charging
period
and
that
was
all
what
was
required.
the
seventh
circuit
thought
otherwise
reasoning
that
disparate
impact
liability
was
designed
as
an
alternative
means
to
establish
deliberate
discrimination
but
even
if
both
theories
aim
at
the
same
evil,
it
does
not
follow
that
their
reach
is
coextensive.
the
city
in
its
amici
argue
that
our
interpretation
will
yield
practical
problems,
employers
they
stress
will
face,
disparate
impact
suits
for
practices
they
have
used
for
years.
in
reality
both
readings
of
the
statute
produced
puzzling
results.
the
consequence
of
the
city’s
approach
would
be
that
once
nobody
has
challenged
the
initial
test,
you
could
and
even
though
it
has
disparate
impact
you
can
use
it
forever.
more
importantly
however
our
task
is
not
to
determine
which
reading
produces
the
least
mischief
but
only
to
give
effect
to
the
law
congress
enacted
with
whatever
mischiefs
it
may
contain.
the
city
argues
that
the
district
court's
judgment
must
be
amended
because
it
ordered
a
relief
pertaining
to
the
first
round
of
selection
in
may
of
96
which
is
indisputably
outside
the
charging
period,
petitioners
do
not
object
to
a
remand
to
resolve
this
issue
so
we
leave
it
to
the
seventh
circuit
to
address.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
