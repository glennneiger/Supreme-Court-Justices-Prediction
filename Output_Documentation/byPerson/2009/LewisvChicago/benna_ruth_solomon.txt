ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
january
1996,
the
city
adopted
and
announced
an
eligibility
list
for
hiring
candidates
who
sat
for
the
firefighters'
examination.
petitioners
were
told
that
a
priority
pool
had
been
created,
that
based
on
their
scores
they
were
not
classified
in
that
pool,
and
that
further
consideration
of
candidates
would
be
limited
to
those
who
were
in
the
priority
pool,
at
least
until
everyone
in
that
pool
had
been
called
for
processing.
the
city
also
publicly
admitted
that
this
tiered
eligibility
list
had
adverse
impact
on
african-americans,
and
petitioners
were
aware
of
this.
but
petitioners
did
not
file
charges
challenging
the
exam
and
the
cutoff
score
within
300
days
after
the
tiered
eligibility
list
was
adopted
and
announced.
now
they
contend
that
charges
can
be
filed
to
challenge
the
same
exam
and
the
same
cutoff
score
every
time
the
city
hired
from
the
priority
hiring
pool.
that
position
cannot
be
squared
with
the
statute.
calling
other
applicants
from
a
hiring
pool
from
which
petitioners
had
already
been
excluded
did
not
limit
or
classify
petitioners
in
any
way.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
if
i
understand
correctly,
that
would
be
the
same
case
as
this,
for
this
reason:
a
list
is
used
in
a
couple
of
different
ways.
a
list
might
be
used
to
describe
the
strict
rank
ordering
that
your
honor
is
describing,
and
in
that
case,
once
there
is
that
kind
of
a
list,
it's
the
same
as
this
case.
what
happened
in
this
case
after
that
kind
of
a
list
was
made,
we
also
drew
another
line,
which
was
the
priority
hiring
pool.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
if--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--so
that
actually
--
if
we're
going
back
to
the
scores
but
no
announcement
has
been
made
ever
that
we
are
going
to
use
the
scores
in
a
certain
way,
we
agree
that
every
time
the
city
actually
consulted
the
scores,
there
would
be
a
new
claim.
but
that's
because--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--the
list
was
the
device
that
limited
and
classified
petitioners
in
this
case,
and
that's
why
it's
so
important.
because
in
order
to
have
a
present
cause
of
action,
section
(a)(2)
--
under
section
(a)(2),
which
is
the
disparate
impact
provision,
petitioners
have
to
point
to
something
in
the
charging
period
that
actually
limited
and
classified
them.
and
that
was
the
effect
of
the
list,
and
including
the
priority
hiring
pool.
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
general
practice,
no
announcement,
no
decision,
nothing,
but
rather
every
time
the
city
makes
hiring,
the
city
undertakes
a
new
decision
with
new
criteria,
then
it
is
making
a
decision
at
that
point;
it
is
engaging
in
a
practice
that
is
then
at
that
time
limiting
and
classifying
the
petitioners.
what
happened--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--the
statute,
(a)(2),
requires
an
unlawful--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--that
is
the
function
of
the
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
of
course
it's
not
unique
to
title
vii.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
correct.
and--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--the
300-day
charging
period
under
title
vii
functions
like
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
when
a
timely
charge
is
not
filed,
no
recovery
can
be
had
for
that
claim.
and
the
court
has
said
that
over
and
over
in
a
series
of
disparate
treatment
cases.
now,
the
defining
feature--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--the
cases
are
disparate
treatment
cases,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
rule
should
be
the
same
in
this
case
for
several
reasons:
first,
those
cases
reflect
that
the
reason
there
is
not
a
present
violation
when
the
consequences
of
a
prior
discriminatory
act
are
felt
is
because
the
defining
feature
of
the
claim
is
absent
within
the
charging
period.
now,
that
is
a
perfectly
good
rule,
no
matter
whether
it's
discriminatory
treatment
or
discriminatory
impact.
and
in
this
case,
the
defining
feature,
namely
disparate
impact
in
the
sense
defined
by
the
statute,
required
by
the
statute,
to
limit
or
classify
in
a
way
that
denies
people
employment
opportunities
based
on
race
--
that
defining
feature
was
absent
within
the
charging
period.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
right.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
i
--
i
have
two
responses,
justice
breyer,
and
the
first
is
that
section
(k),
which
is
what
your
honor
is
quoting
from,
does
not
describe
accrual,
and
it
does
not
define
the
underlying
violation.
it
talks
about
when
an
--
excuse
me,
when
a
violation
is
established.
and
what's
so
interesting
is
that
the
reliance
on
those
words
(k).
you
actually
can't
apply
section
(k)
literally
to
this
case
and
have
anything
that
approaches
anything
that
makes
sense.
and
that's
because
section
(k)
actually
goes
on
after
those
words
that
get
highlighted
over
and
over,
and
it's
--
and
it
refers
to
the
rest
of
what
happens
in
a
case
when
a
claim
of
disparate
impact
is
tried.
and
so
if
you--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--subsection--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--correct.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
because
there
is
no
act
that
limits
and
classifies.
and
what's
interesting
about
section
(h),
it's
not--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--well,
that's
what
is
actually
missing
in
this
case.
the
city
did
not
go
back
to
the
test
results,
and
it
did
not
--
it
did
not
create
--
engage
in
a
new
decision
or
a
new
practice.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
petitioners
continued
to
be
ineligible
for
as
long
as
the
list
was
used
in
the
way
that
we
said
at
the
outset
it
was
going
to
be
used;
namely,
that
the
well-qualified
pool,
the
priority
hiring
pool,
would
be
called
first.
the
reason
they
continued
to
be
ineligible
is
because
they
had
been
limited
and
classified
as
ineligible
until
the
priority
pool
was
hired
first.
that
was
the
only
practice
that
had
adverse
impact
within
--
as
required
by
the
statute,
meaning
limit
and
classify.
now,
to
complete
my
answer
to
justice
breyer--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
realize
you
had
finished.
excuse
me.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
a
case
like
that
might
present
different
accrual
problems
for
this
reason:
there
might
be
several
appropriate
times
when
a
person
affected
by
a
policy
like
that
could
be
said
actually
to
have
been
limited
and
classified
in
their
employment
opportunities.
and
it
could
be
when
they
enter
grade
school,
but
that
is
not
an
appropriate
time,
so
if
it's
10
years
before
the
act
--
so
that
person
is
--
is
roughly
8
years
old.
it
could
be
when
they
apply
to
the
employer.
it
could
be
a
variety
of
other
times.
but
those
cases,
whatever
difficult
accrual
problems
and
questions
they
present,
they
are
not
presented
here,
because
this
was
a
closed
universe.
everybody
affected
by
the
city's
eligibility
list
and
the
test
and
the
cutoff
score
knew
from
the
moment--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--but
if
they
are
not
interested
in
employment
with
that
employer,
then
they
are
not
--
it
--
you
--
they
are
certainly
affected
in
one
sense
of
the
word,
but
they're
perhaps
--
it
would
not
be
possible
to
say
their
employment
opportunities
had
been
affected.
we
certainly
agree
that
there
should
be
one
time
to
challenge
every
employment
practice
that
has
an
unlawful
disparate
impact,
but
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
more
than
one
to
challenge
exactly
the
same
thing?
petitioners--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--right.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
our
position
is
that
the
charging
period
runs
from
the
unlawful
practice.
and
the
court
has
stressed
it
is
important
to
confirm--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--the
unlawful
practice
here
was
limiting
and
classifying
petitioners
in
a
way
that
deprived
them
of
their
employment
opportunities.
this
is
what
--
this
--
what
they
were
told--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--correct.
and
after
that
decision
was
made,
there
was
nothing
else
that
chicago
did
that
affected
petitioners
in
the
terms
required
by
the
statute.
hiring
others
did
not
adversely
affect
petitioners
because
they
were--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--the
statute
requires
that
the
--
the
complainant
be
limited
and
classified
in
their
employment
opportunity.
so--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--the
difference
is
that
once
petitioners
here
were
classified
out
of
the
eligible
pool
for
priority
hiring,
they
were
out.
they
were
simply
out.
they
were
not
being
considered
anymore
at
all.
we
didn't
go
back
to
look
at
the
test.
we
didn't
consider
petitioners.
we
didn't
reject
them
each
time.
there
could
be--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--with
respect--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--with
respect,
justice
alito,
the
letter
does
say
that
because
of
the
large
number
of
people
who
were
classified
well-qualified,
a
step
ahead
of
where
petitioners
were
classified,
it
was
not
likely
that
they
were
going
to
be
hired.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
and
for
that
reason,
that
is
when
the
injury
and
the
impact
was
felt.
whatever
else
later
happened,
whether
chicago
hired
a
lot
of
people,
chicago
hired
no
one,
whether
chicago
even
hired
some
of
the
petitioners,
they
had
years'
worth
of
delay.
and
at
this
point
in
the
litigation,
it
is
undisputed.
the
city
made
149
hires
from
the
first
use
of
the
list.
that's
more
than
any
other
class--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--correct.
because
the
impact,
at
a
minimum,
is
the
delay
in
hiring.
and
the
court
has
made
quite
clear
that
you
don't
--
a
complainant
or
plaintiff
does
not
have
to
feel
all
of
the
consequences
right
at
the
outset
to--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--with
respect,
chief
justice
roberts,
they
are
injured.
their
hiring
will
be
delayed,
possibly
substantially.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
they
are
injured
by
a
4-month
delay.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
but
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
information
is
not
conveyed
in
a
way
that
would
put
a
reasonable
person
on
notice
that
he
or
she
had
a
claim
right
at
the
outset,
and
that
relates
also
to
the
high
school
diploma
hypothetical.
if
the--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--but
it
wouldn't
change
the
fact
that
there
had
been,
at
least
a
--
if
you
wait
for
the
next
list,
you
still
have
been
delayed
at
least
3
years
in
your
ability
to
be
hired
as
a
firefighter.
and
as
far
as
the
reason
why
we
didn't
follow
through
on
the
aspirational
goal
of
giving
another
test
within
3
years,
the
tests
are
very
difficult
and
expensive
to
deliver,
i
think
--
to
develop,
excuse
me.
the
record
in
this
case
actually
makes
that
clear.
despite
rather
significant
steps,
including
the
use
of
a
prominent
african-american
industrial
psychologist
to
develop
this
test,
it
had
severe
adverse
impact.
the
test
actually
compares
rather
favorably
to
the
test
that
was
given
in
the
city
of
new
haven,
but
the
district
court
invalidated
it,
and,
you
know,
we
did
undertake
to
develop
a
new
test.
but--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--surely
the
court--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--we
have
not
pressed
that
claim.
that
is
correct,
justice
alito,
but--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--there
was
some
testimony
--
and
we
quote
it
in
our
brief
--
about
things
that
the
person
responsible
for
setting
the
cutoff
score
could
not
remember.
but
a
statute
of
limitations
actually
doesn't
require
prejudice,
so
we
didn't
undertake
to
try
to
prove
that.
the
--
repose
arises
naturally
at
the
end
of
the
charging
period.
it's
not
something
that
--
that
the
defendant
has
to
earn
either
by
capitulating
to
the
plaintiffs'
demands
or
otherwise
proving
prejudice.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
it
--
it
wasn't
possible
simply
to
take
the
list
down.
the
court's
opinion
in
ricci
makes
that
quite
clear.
our
expert
told
us
all
the
way
through
the
trial
--
he
testified
at
the
trial--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
--
i
believe--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
believe--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
believe
the
court's
opinion
in
ricci
addresses
that
as
well.
that
that's
a
--
a
misuse
of
the
test
scores.
the
expert
was
resolute
even
through
the
trial--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--he
--
his
reason
for
suggesting
the
65
cutoff
score
was
because
of
the
adverse
impact.
that
was
an
attempt
to
deal
with
adverse
impact,
but
his
position
was
the
test
was
valid
to
measure
the
cognitive
aspects
that
it
was
attempting
to
measure,
and
that
those
related
to
the
training
firefighters
had
to
undergo
in
the
academy.
and
he
was
clear
as
well,
that
a
higher
score
created
an
inference
that
the
person
was
more
qualified
to
--
to
perform
in
the
way--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--we
have.
but
the
reason
that
i'm
mentioning
it
is
because
it's
not
simply
a
matter
of
--
of
why
don't
you
take
the
list
down.
at
the
time
that
the
expert
is
telling
us
the
test
is
valid
and
it
can
--
it
gives
rise
to
an
inference
that
people
closer
to
the
top
are
better
--
possess
more
of
the
cognitive
abilities
that
the
test
was
testing
for,
we
would
have
at
a
minimum
been
courting
disparate
treatment
liability
to
adjust
the
scores,
to
randomize
them
further,
or
to
take
the
list
down.
but
to
return--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--it
seriously
diminished
the
opportunities
of
the
people
who
were
at
89
and
above.
there
were
about
1,700
applicants
at
89
or
above,
and
there
were
22,000
65
or
above.
so
calling
in
random
order--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--correct,
but
read
in
conjunction
with
the
300-day
charging
period.
and
i
would
like
to
follow
up
just
briefly
on
answers
to
justice
breyer
and
justice
sotomayor.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
i
--
i'm
sorry.
that
was
the
--
so,
yes,
at
the
point
where
the
employer
is
assessing
the
options,
the
city
was
not
sued
within
--
excuse
me,
charges
were
not
filed
within
300
days
after
the
tiered
eligibility
list
was
adopted
and
announced.
petitioners
were
aware
that
it
had
adverse
impact.
no
charges
were
filed
then;
no
charges
were
filed
after
the
first
use
of
the
list.
so
at
some
point
when
the
employer
is
weighing
the
options,
the
employer
can
also
factor
in
the
time
to
challenge
this
has
passed.
what
petitioners
seek
here
is
new
opportunities
--
11
--
10
opportunities
to
challenge
exactly
the
same
thing
that
they
--
that
they
would
have
challenged
if
they
had
filed
a
charge
promptly.
they
continue
to
emphasize
that
the
eligibility
pool,
when
compared
with
the
pool
of
applicants,
had
a
disparate
impact.
but
that's
not
a
new
violation.
that's
not
a
new
classification,
and
it
doesn't
limit
anybody's
opportunities
in
any
way
beyond
what
they
were
already
limited.
that's
the
old
violation.
that's
the
one
they
didn't
charge.
now,
petitioners
do
claim
that
the
shortfall
evidence
showed
that
they
--
showed
and
the
use
of
the
list
had
disparate
impact
each
time.
but
it
actually
didn't,
either.
that
also
was
the
old
violation.
that
shortfall
was
compiled
by
comparing
the
number
of
african-americans
who
were
hired
using
the
89
cutoff
score
and
the
number
who
would
have
been
called
for
further
processing
if--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--correct.
but
you
have--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--but
the
fact--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
the
statute
goes
on,
and
it
describes
the
later
things
that
happened
at
trial.
so
in
our
view,
read
literally--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
respondent
fails
to
demonstrate
that
the
challenged
process
is
job-related,
or
subpart
(ii),
there
is
an
alternative
practice
with
less
disparate
impact.
so
--
so
(k),
if
(k)
is
going
to
be
consulted
at
all,
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
should
be,
because
section
706(e),
which
has
always
been
thought
of
as
the
charging
period,
talks
about
an
alleged
unlawful
practice,
and
that's
what
the
person
knows
at
the
outset.
section
(k)
talks
about
the
burden
of
proof
and
how
you
go
about
proving
these
at
trial,
and
that's
why
it
uses
the
word
"established".
but
that's
also
why
it
describes
the
entirety
of
what
happens
at
trial.
read
literally,
you
can
pluck
a
few
words
out
of
the
--
out
of
one
of
these
provisions
and
say,
aha,
they
used
an
employment
practice.
you
have
to
read
the
whole
thing
together
if
you're
going
to
read
it
at
all,
and
when
you
read
the
whole
thing
together,
you
come
up
with
the
absurd
result
that
the
charging
period
doesn't
run
until
the
district
court
brings
the
gavel
down
and
determines
that
an
unlawful
practice
has
been
established.
in
this
case,
that
would
have
meant
that
the
people
65
and
below
could
file
charges
within
300
days
after
the
district
court's
decision,
which
is
something
like
11
years
after
the
practice
in
this
case.
and
that's
because
that
was
the
moment
at
which
it
was
established.
and
that's
why
we
think
that
(k)
does
not
bear
on
this.
and
(h)--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--right,
and
that's
why--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--it's
not--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--you
--
but
again,
even
if
(k)
is
consulted
--
and
for
the
reasons
that
i
just
outlined
we
don't
think
that
it
should
be.
it
doesn't
bear
on
accrual.
but
even
if
(k)
is
consulted,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
say
that
any
use
of
an
employment
practice
is
--
is
a
new
unlawful
act.
it
has
to
be
an
employment
practice
that
actually
has
disparate
impact.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
this
is
actually--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--excuse
me,
justice
breyer.
this
is
actually
a
slightly
different
point.
at
the
outset,
i
indicated
why
section
(k)
does
not
bear
on
accrual
at
all;
it
describes
what
happens
at
trial,
and
for
that
reason--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--you
really
can't
pluck
a
few
words
out
of
the
middle.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
but
even
if
one
is
going
to
consult
it
to
determine
accrual,
what
it
says
is
that
the
use
of
an
employment
practice
with
adverse
impact.
and
in
this
case
there
was
only
one,
and
that
one
was
when
petitioners
were
limited
and
classified
based
on
the
test
scores.
nothing
that
happened
after
that,
including
hiring
others,
was
an
unlawful
practice
with
disparate
impact
in
a
way
that
affected
the
petitioners.
they
had
already
been
rejected.
when
an
employer
says,
i
will
not
consider
you
for
the
position,
or
perhaps
it
says,
i
will
not
consider
you
for
the
position
until
i
have
considered
a
lot
of
other
people
first,
that
is
a
rejection.
nothing
that
happens
after
that,
whether
the
person
hires
somebody
else,
whether
the
person
doesn't
hire
somebody
else,
whether
they
change
their
mind
and
later
hire
the
person
whom
they
had
previously
rejected
--
ricks,
after
all
had
a
grievance
pending.
it
was
certainly
possible
that
that
would
change
the
outcome
in
the
case,
but
the
court,
nonetheless,
says
you
cannot
wait
for
the
consequences
to
be
felt.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
correct,
but
there
is
no--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--correct.
but
the
only
practice
in
this
case
that
had
a
disparate
impact
in
the
sense
used
by
the
statute
was
when
the
tiered
eligibility
list
was
made.
after
that,
of
course
there
was
a
consequence
of
that.
consequences
can
be
felt
in
employment
for
a
long
time.
the
people
in
the
well-qualified
pool
were
hired
before
petitioners,
they
were
paid
before
petitioners,
they
are
going
to
get
their
pensions
before
petitioners.
those
things
continue
to
have
consequences.
but
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
consequences
cannot
be
challenged
by
themselves
unless
there
actually
is
a
present
violation.
now,
there
is
not
even
an
argument
in
the
other
side's
briefs,
neither
of
them,
that
explains
why
there
was
an
adverse
impact
based
on
race
under
(a)(2)
at
any
point
when
the
city
used
the
list.
if
one
reads
the
briefs
very
carefully,
one
will
see
that
those
times
when
a
claim
is
made
in
the
briefs
that
we
used
an
unlawful
practice,
it
always
goes
back
to
the
test
and
the
list.
simply
keeping
the
list
up
after
we
announce
it
is
not
a
new
violation.
it
is
quite
clear
in
the
cases
that
the
employer
does
not
have
to
change
a
decision
in
order
to
obtain
repose.
and,
of
course,
the
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
are
simply
different
methods
of
proving
a
claim.
they
are
not
different
claims
by
themselves.
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
the
statutory
language,
there
are
a
number
of
policy
reasons
that
while
we
don't
rely
on
them
heavily,
we
do
rely
on
the
statute.
they
should
nonetheless
be
considered
in
deciding
this.
there
was
no
sense
in
which
a
claim
filed
to
challenge
the
list
was
premature.
it
was
the
one
act
that
actually
limited
and
classified
petitioners.
everything
else
that
happened
after
that
either
didn't
affect
the
petitioners
at
all,
as
in
hiring
people
who
had
made
the
cut,
or
it
affected
them
only
in
the
colloquial
sense,
that
the
consequences
of
the
prior
act
continued.
chicago
did
not
have
to
revisit
this
in
order
to
obtain
repose.
the
statute
makes
that
quite
clear.
mr.
payton
emphasizes
only
the
policy
of
righting
employment
wrongs,
but
there
are
other
policies
in
the
statute.
in
addition
to
repose,
the
statute
makes
clear
that
claims
should
be
brought
to
the
eeoc
at
the
earliest
opportunity.
excuse
me.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
