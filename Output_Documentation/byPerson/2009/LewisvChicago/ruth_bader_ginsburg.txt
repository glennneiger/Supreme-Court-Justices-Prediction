justice

if
it
--
if
it
stopped
using
it,
it
might
be
vulnerable
to
a
rizzo-type
suit
from
the
people
who
were
benefiting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
in
ricci
that
was
new
haven's
position,
that
they
thought
that
the
test
was
unlawful
because
of
the
disparate
impact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
long
does
the
city's
exposure
persist?
let's
say
that
the
--
in
the
tenth
round,
someone
is
selected
for
the
job
from
the
qualified
group.
and
then
there's
a
cutback,
and
there
are
going
to
be
layoffs.
so
the
last
hired
is
the
first
fired.
could
--
would
there
be
a
title
vii
suit
when
that
last
hired
is
laid
off,
on
the
ground
that
if
chicago
had
done
what
it
was
supposed
to
do,
this
person
would
have
had
the
job
long
ago
and
would
be
higher
up
on
the
seniority
list?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
had
a
footnote
in
your
reply
brief
that
said
that
if
your
position
prevails
there
would
need
to
be
an
adjustment
in
the
relief
granted
by
the
district
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
there
were
no
list,
but
each
time
there
was
a
hiring
round
the
city
just
took
from
the
top
--
from
the
top
score
down.
there's
no
list,
but
each
time
the
city
uses
the
test
results
and
hires
the
people
with
the
top
scores.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
my
--
my
hypothetical
was
there's
no
list
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
just
go
back
to
the
raw
scores,
and
each
time
they
picked
the
top
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
--
what
is
the
list,
other
than
an
administratively
convenient
way
to
use
the
scores?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
even
though
there
is
a
clear
case
on
the
merits
of
disparate
impact,
unless
the
suit
is
commenced
within
30
days
of
the
announcement,
then
it's
as
though
it
were
lawful.
that's
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
--
is
that
--
there's
a
free
pass.
you
don't
sue
within
30
days
of
the
compilation
of
the
list
and
the
notice
of
the
list;
you
sue
420
days
later.
the
discriminatory
practice
gets
frozen,
the
status
quo
gets
frozen
forever.
that's
--
that
is
your
position,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
not
exactly
a
title
--
a
statute
of
limitations.
it's
a
time
you
have
to
file
your
charge.
it's
a
charge
filing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
also
a
2-year
statute
of
limitations
in
title
vii.
you
can't
get
back
pay,
i
think,
for
more
than
2
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
you
don't
have
one
case,
i
think,
certainly
not
from
this
court,
of
disparate
impact.
all
the
cases
that
you
cite
are
disparate
treatment
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
let's
add
to
that,
that
it
was
adopted
10
years
ago--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
duke
power
announced
to
the
world
that
it
was
going
to
use
a
high
school
diploma.
indeed,
it
listed
in
the
county
all
of
the
high
school
graduates
and
said:
this
is
the
list.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
put
that
in
concrete
terms?
it
was
the
89
percent
cutoff,
so
that
anybody
who
got
below
89
percent
on
the
test
was
never
going
to
be
considered
until
all
the
first
people
who
got
89
to
98.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
have
to
take
the
list
down.
you
simply
could
have
said:
anyone
who
got
a
passing
score,
anyone
who
is
qualified
--
we're
not
going
to
make
the
distinction
between
qualified
and
unqualified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
have
to
throw
out
the
list.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
have
to
throw
out
the
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
expert
said
--
the
test
devisor
said
he
didn't
make
up
that
89
percent
cutoff.
that
was
chicago
that
made
that
--
that
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
you've
lost
--
you've
lost
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
but
--
but
going
to
65,
opening
up
the
classification,
is
not
adjusting
the
scores;
it's
not
taking
the
list
down;
it's
just
saying
anyone
who
passes
the
test
can
proceed
to
the
next
step.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
disparate
treatment
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
--
the
argument
here
is
disparate
impact
is
different
because
there's
no
need
to
show
intent
of
disparate
impact.
