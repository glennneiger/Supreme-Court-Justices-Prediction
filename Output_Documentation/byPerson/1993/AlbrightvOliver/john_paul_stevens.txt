yes.
but
if
the
challenge
is
to...
of
the
adequacies
of
illinois'
criminal
procedures,
would
it
be...
would
you
say
the
criminal
procedures
are
preserved...
reserved
from
challenge
because
there's
a
civil
remedy,
when
there's
a
civil
remedy?
that's
quite
different
from
parratt.
there
you
had
a
civil
claim.
and
you
say
you
looked
at
the
entire
procedure
to
say
that
that's
adequate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
give
you
hypothetical
that
has
kind
of
troubled
me
as
i've
thought
about
this
case.
supposing
you
had
an
arrest
supported
by
probable
cause.
a
witness
had
sworn
to
a
set
of
facts
that
established
probable
cause
and
the
man
is
arrested.
but
before
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
witness
recants
and
the
police
officers
investigate
the
facts
and
decide
there
really
is
not
probable
cause.
the
arrest
was
lawful
when
made,
but
at
the
time
they
institute
the
prosecution
they
know
they
do
not
have
probable
cause.
is
there
any
interference
with
his
liberty
by
going
forward
with
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
it
was
just
restriction
to
the
bond
conditions.
he
had
to
put
up
money
to
get
out
on
bond
and
his
travel
restrictions
are
similar
to
they
were
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
restraint
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
one
that
was
caused
by
the
arrest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
quite
understand
that
argument.
acquitted
defendants,
in
order
to
prevail,
have
to
prove
an
absence
of
probable
cause,
not
just
that
they
were
found...
not
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
don't
they
have
a
false
arrest
charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
can
do
that,
don't
they
have
a
false
arrest
claim
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
if
they're
going
to
argue
there
was
no
probable
cause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
the
fact
that
she
had
about
50
other
cases
that
didn't
work
out,
wasn't
that
right?
