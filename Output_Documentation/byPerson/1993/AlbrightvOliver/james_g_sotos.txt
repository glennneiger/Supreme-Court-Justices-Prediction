mr.
james
g.
sotos
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honors,
we
have
three
principal
submissions.
first,
that
the
court
should
not
expand
the
concepts
of
fundamental
liberties
and
substantive
due
process
in
order
to
reach
a
claim
that
an
individual
was
charged
with
a
crime
without
probable
cause
so
long,
of
course,
as
that
individual
was
not
incarcerated
pending
disposition
of
the
charges.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
there
might
be
some
intrusion
on
a
liberty
interest,
the
focus
for
purposes
of
due
process
should
be
on
whether
the
state
provides
adequate
procedures
in
order
to
protect
against
the
risk
of
an
arbitrary
deprivation
of
that
interest.
and
in
this
case
i
would
point
out
that
the
petitioner
concedes
he
advances
no
challenge
to
illinois'
procedures
for
processing
and
filing
of
criminal
charges.
finally,
in
the
event
that
the
court
determines
that
there
would
be
a
fundamental
right
which
could
potentially
be
implicated
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
would
submit
that
principles
of
substantive
due
process
should
not
be
implicated
unless
a
petitioner
or
a
plaintiff
alleges
facts
which
are
sufficient
to
support
an
inference
of
malice
or
improper
purpose
or
some
other
form
of
intentional
or
egregious
misconduct.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
we
think
it
would
have
some
bearing
on
our
second
submission
with
respect
to
the
procedures
that
are
provided
by
the
state.
the
state
provides
comprehensive
procedures
for
the
filing
and
processing
of
charges.
information
has
to
be
filed
upon
a
prosecutor's
official
oath.
the
sixth
amendment
safeguards,
of
course,
attach
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
charge.
illinois
provides
all
criminal
defendants
with
a
preliminary
hearing
to
determine
probable
cause.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
we--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--well,
we
do
believe
that
under
a
parratt
v.
taylor
type
analysis,
that
the
fact
that
the
state
of
illinois
provides
a
common
law
tort
remedy
for
malicious
prosecution
certainly
makes
it
much
easier
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
the
entirety
of
illinois'
procedures
are
adequate.
and
certainly
the
malicious
prosecution
remedy
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
those
procedures.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
we
think
that
the
focus,
for
purposes
of
a
procedural
due
process
analysis,
should
be
on
the
entirety
of
the
remedies
that
the
state
provides.
and
that
includes
the
criminal...
the
remedies
that
are
inherent
in
the
criminal
process,
as
well
as
the
post
deprivation
common
law
tort
remedy.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
that
would
be
a
difficult...
more
difficult
case,
but
we
would...
i
would
not
take
the
position
that
the
state
remedies
were
rendered
inadequate
solely
because
a
state
chose
to
do
away
with
its
common
law
tort
remedy.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
in
this
case
we're
not,
your
honor,
because
the
state
of
illinois
does
provide
the
common
law
tort
remedy.
but
if
we
were
here
on
another
case
in
which
a
state
did
not
provide
that
remedy,
we
do
think
there
would
be
a
strong
argument
that
the
state's
criminal
procedures,
in
and
of
themselves,
could
satisfy
due
process.
as
justice
stevens
indicated
in
his
concurrence
opinion
in
daniels
v.
williams,
the
state
does
not
have
to
provide
a
post
deprivation
common
law
tort
remedy
in
all
circumstances
to
satisfy--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--no,
certainly
we
do
not
take
that
position.
in
the
arrest
context,
the
actual
act
of
the
arrest
would
implicate
a
fundamental
right
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
give
rise
to
a
fourth
amendment
false
arrest
claim.
which
i
would
point
out
that
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
noted
in
this
case
that
the
petitioner's
complaint
did
state
a
valid
fourth
amendment
claim
for
an
arrest
without
probable
cause.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
petitioner
pressed
the
fundamental
right
to
travel
claim
below.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
because
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--certainly,
it
is.
but
there
is
no
contention
in
this
case
that
this
prosecution
was
brought
for
purposes
of
presenting...
of
preventing
mr.
albright
from
leaving
the
state.
in--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--i
would
say
not
in
this
case,
because
there
is
no
allegation
here
that
the
petitioner
even
sought
to
leave
the
state.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
under
those
circumstances,
if
there
had
been
an
allegation
that
the
petitioner
sought
to
leave
the
state,
i
would
submit
that
the
restriction
that
the
state
of
illinois
imposes
on
the
fundamental
right
to
travel
is
a
very
narrowly
tailored
restriction
which
is
necessary
to
serve
the
state's
compelling
interest
of
insuring
that
criminal
defendants
appear
for
trial.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
no.
my
point
would
be
that
under
those
circumstances
the
state's
restriction
would
be
justified
under
a...
under
a
due
process
analysis,
because
it
was
narrowly
tailored
to
serve
the
state's
interest.
all
the
individual
has
to
do
is
go
into
court
and
ask
for
leave
to
leave
the
state.
now
presumably
if,
in
a
given
circumstance,
there
were
some
special
circumstances
that
rendered
it
unlikely
that
the
person
would
return
for
trial,
then
the
state's
restriction
would
be
justified
under
those...
for
those
purposes.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
so,
the
probable
cause
would
dissipate
from
the
point
of
arrest--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--to
the
time
of
moving
forward.
i
would
submit
that
that
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
the
criminal
defendant
was
incarcerated
at
the
time
the
probable
cause
dissipated.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
no,
we
would
contend
that
under
those
circumstances
that's
not
a
significant
enough
restraint
on
liberty
to
warrant
a
separate
determination
of
probable
cause
and
to
prevent
the
state
from
going
forward.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
again,
we
would
distinguish
between
the
restraint
that
is
caused
by
the
arrest,
which
is
an
actual
seizure
where
the
person's
body
is
taken
into
custody,
and
the
restraint
which
may
be
imposed
by
the
conditions
of
the
bond,
which...
and
in
saying
that,
we
don't
seek
to
minimize
or
belittle
the
fact
that
a
criminal
defendant,
even
one
who
is
on
bail,
can
suffer
a
substantial
price
in
terms
of
anxiety,
emotional
distress,
and--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg.
again,
i
would
distinguish
between
an
arrest
and
a
detention
and
a
situation
when
a
person
is
on
bond.
when
that
person
is
on
bond--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--i
would
disagree
with
that.
i
would
continue
to
adhere
to
my
position
that
the
seizure
occurs
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
the
formal
charge
gives
the
state...
moves
the
state
processes
forward.
but
so
long
as
the
individual
is
free
on
bail,
i
would
not
concede
that
he
is
under
arrest
even
in
a
technical
sense.
he
has
the
freedom
at
that
point
to
live
with
his
family
and
among
his
friends,
to
pursue
his
occupation,
in
this
case
his
education.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
well,
the
petitioner
alleges
that
he
was
under
arrest.
but--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--certainly.
and
that
gave
rise
at
that
moment
to
a
plausible
fourth
amendment
claim
for
an
unlawful
arrest.
the
problem,
as
we
see
it
in
this
case,
is
because
the
false...
the
fourth
amendment
false
arrest
claim
is--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--perhaps
at
the
point
where
he
had
to
go
through
the
indignities
of
the
booking
process,
being
photographed,
taken
through
the
process.
he
presumably
was
not
free
to
leave
at
that
point.
he
had
to
complete
that
booking
process
until
he
left.
and
the
seventh
circuit,
at
least,
noted
that
that
was
the
point
which
would
be
considered
an
arrest.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
that's
correct.
after
he
is
released
from
the
police
station,
if
he's
made
bail
i
think
the
appropriate
answer
to
that
question
is
i
am
no
longer
under
arrest.
however,
i
have
been
charged
with
an
offense
which
i'll
have
to
answer
in
court.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
reason
that
the...
the
fact
that
the
false
arrest
claim
was
dismissed
as
untimely
is
why
we're
into
this
area
of
substantive
due
process.
what
the
petitioner
really
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
take
the
entire
fourth
amendment
body
of
probable
cause
jurisprudence
and
graft
it
onto
the
substantive
component
to
the
due
process
clause
as
a
means
of
reaching
the
charging
decision.
and
i
think
that
ignores
the
fact
that
criminal
defendants
do
not
have
a
right
to
be
charged
only
upon
reliable
evidence,
in
the
same
sense
that
a
police
officer
must
make
a
preliminary
determination
of
reliability
before
conducting
a
search
or
a
seizure.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
i
would
concede
that
certainly
the
criminal
defendant
suffers
the
effects,
the
anxiety
and
the
emotional
distress
as
a
result
of
the
pendency
of
all
of
the
proceedings
against
him,
which
may
include
the
fact
that
he
had
been
arrested.
nonetheless,
i
would
not
concede
that
the
arrest
itself
actually
continues
through
the
point
of
determination
to
the
proceedings.
the
arrest
occurs
when
the
individual's
freedom
of
movement
is
curtailed
at
the
point
when
he
is
taken
into
custody.
and
then
when
he
is
released,
i
would
submit
that
that
arrest
is
over.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
that,
again,
would
depend
upon...
i
think
that
would
depend
on
an
allegation
that
the
petitioner
would
have
to
make
that
the
proceedings
were
brought
in
order
to
curtail
his
fundamental
right
to
travel
and--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--if
he
was
told
that
he
could
not
leave
the
state.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
that
would
perhaps
be
true.
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
of
illinois'
restriction
requires
only
that
the
individual
go
into
court
and
seek
leave
of
court
before
leaving
the
state.
i
don't
view--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--well,
again,
i
think
that
the...
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the...
any
claim
that...
which
would
be
based
on
a
fundamental
right
to
travel,
the
focus
would
have
to
be
on
whether
or
not
the
state's
restriction
was
narrowly
tailored
to
serve
its
compelling
state
interests.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
if
you're
told--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--i
would
think
that
that
would...
if
you're
told
you
can't
leave
the
city
or
the
state,
that
that
would
be
tantamount
to
perhaps
a
continuation
of
the
arrest.
but
still,
under
those
circumstances,
that
would
only
give
rise
to
a
fourth
amendment
claim
for
an
unlawful
arrest.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
we
don't
view
that
as
a
necessary...
as
an
acceptable
justification
for
not
going
into
court
and
asking
the
court
to
leave...
to
leave
the
state.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
again--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--we
would
not
make
that
concession.
we
think
this
case
differs
from
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
because
he
was
not
told
that
he
could
not
leave
the
state.
there
were
incidental
restrictions
on
his
bond
which
included
a
requirement
that
he
ask
the...
ask
the
court
before
he
leaves
the
state.
we
don't
view
that
as
being
the
same
as
a
situation
where
a
person
is
arrested
and
then
told
you
cannot
leave
the
state,
you
cannot
leave
the
city.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
unless
you
first
seek
leave
of
court,
correct.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
certainly,
that
is
our
contention,
that
the
individual
would
at
least
have
to
allege
that
he
sought
to
leave
the
state
and
he
was
restricted
from
doing
so,
before
he
would
raising
a
claim
based
on
a
fundamental
right
to
travel.
and
i
would
again
point
out
that
that
issue
is
nowhere
mentioned
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
it's
only
mentioned
in
his--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--we
would
contend
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
he
was
not
under
arrest
after
he
left
the
police
station,
and
was
essentially
free
to
go
about
his
daily
affairs
with
very
few
restrictions
by
the
state.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
we
believe
that
under
gerstein
v.
pugh
that
would
be
a
fourth
amendment
claim,
because
gerstein
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
preliminary
determination
of
probable
cause
to
all
criminal
defendants
who
are
incarcerated
who
don't
make
bail.
in
asking
the
court
to
exercise
restraint
and
to
not
recognize
a
new
fundamental
right
in
this
case,
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
the
constitution
can
play
a
prominent
role
with
respect
to
the
charging
decision.
charges
that
are
brought
on
the
basis
of
a
person's
race,
sex,
or
religion
can
all
give
rise
to
an
equal
protection
claim.
a
prosecution
initiated
in
retaliation
for
a
person's
exercise
of
their
right
of
free
speech
or
as
a
result
of
a
person's
political
views
can
give
rise
to
a
first
amendment
claim.
and,
again,
to
the
extent
that
the
filing
of
the
charge
is
viewed
as
implicating
some
liberty
interests,
it's
our
position
that
due
process
should
focus
on
the
procedures
that
the
state
provides.
and,
again,
under
illinois
law
there
are
a
host
of
procedures
inherent
in
the
criminal
process
and
there
is,
of
course,
if
all
of
that
isn't
sufficient,
the
recognition
by
the
state
of
a
common
law
tort
claim
for
malicious
prosecution.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
early
in
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
i
pointed
out
to
mr.
bisbee
that
the
illinois
tort
immunity
act
required
common
law
claims
against
public
officials
to
be
brought
within
1
year...
a
common
law
malicious
prosecution
claim
to
be
brought
within
1
year
of
the
dismissal
of
the
charges.
and
it
was
after
that
that
he
dropped
the
common
law
malicious
prosecution
claim--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--without
prejudice,
that's
correct.
one
other
flaw
in
the
petitioner's
probable
cause
standard
that
he
proposed
upon
this
court,
we
believe,
is
that
it
would
permit
liability
for
mere
negligence
of
a
public
official.
and
in
so
doing,
what
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
create
is
a
federal
remedy
which
is
not
only
supplementary
to
the
remedy
which
is
provided
now
at
the
common
law,
but
in
fact
is
a
much
broader
remedy
because
what
it
does
is
read
out
the
element
of
malice
which
exists
at
the
common
law.
as
a
result
of
that,
under
the
petitioner's
probable
cause
standard
it
is
conceivable
that
virtually
every
criminal
defendant,
after
acquitted,
could
turn
around
and
sue
in
federal
court
claiming
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
the
charges
against
me.
we
would
submit
that
that
standard
far
exceeds
the
restrictions
which
this
court
has
placed
on
the
scope
of
due
process
violations
in
cases
like
daniels
v.
williams
and
davidson
v.
cannon,
where
the
court
held
that
mere
negligence
is
never
enough
to
implicate
the
due
process
clause.
and,
traditionally,
what
has
been
required
is
intentional--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--that's
correct.
but
our
position
is
that
it
would
be...
it
would
not
take
a
lot
for
a
criminal
defendant
who
was
acquitted
to
turn
around
and
simply
allege
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
justify
the
charges
against
me,
which
is
really
what's
happening--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--pardon?
mr.
james
g.
sotos
that
would
address
probable
cause
for
the
filing
of
the...
for
the
arrest.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
but
in
this
particular
case...
a
little
background
about
this
case.
what--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--of
a
malicious
prosecution
claim.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
that's
true.
and
i
believe
justice
stevens
was--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--that's
correct.
a
false
arrest
claim
would
be
based
solely
on
the
fourth
amendment,
which
requires
only
that
a
seizure
be
reasonable.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
what
the
petitioner
really
is
alleging
is
this
claim
is
that
he
was
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
information
which
was
provided
to
him
by
an
obviously
unreliable
paid
informant.
and
in
so
doing,
really
what
he
is
contending
is
that
he
has
the
right
to
be
charged
only
upon
reliable
evidence.
but,
again,
we
know
from
cases
in
the
grand
jury
context
such,
as
the
united
states
v.
williams,
that
that's
not
the
case.
in
that
case
the
court
refused
to
require
a
prosecutor
to
even
turn
over
exculpatory
evidence
to
a
grand
jury.
now,
in
this
case
we're
not
even
talking
about
exculpatory
evidence.
rather,
it
involves
bits
and
pieces
of
information
which
the
petitioner
claims
cast
grave
doubt
on
the
informant's
reliability:
the
fact
that
she
was
herself
a
cocaine
addict;
the
fact
that
the
substance
which
she
turned
over
to
the
officer
turned
out
to
be
baking
soda;
and
finally
the
fact
that
she
had
previously
identified
another
member
of
petitioner's
family
before
suggesting
that
it
was
petitioner
that
sold
this
substance.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
well,
again,
there
are
a
number
of
allegations
which
cast
doubt
on
the
informant's
reliability.
but
my
point
is
that
in
the
charging
process
the
state
has
never
been
required
to
justify
its
charges
upon
only
reliable
evidence.
that
has
been
a
function
for
the
trial
process,
rather
than
the
charging
process.
and
there's
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
in
the
fourth
amendment
context
where
the
fourth
amendment,
of
course,
serves
as
the
only
constitutional
buffer
between
the
state
and
the
citizen.
in
those
cases
police
officers
are
required
to
make
an
initial
determination
of
reliability.
but,
again,
that's
never
been
a
requirement
of
the
state
with
respect
to
the
charging
process,
and
acceptance
of
petitioner's
standard
here
would
require
that
the
court
went
that
far.
your
honors,
we
have
several
other
backup
arguments
in
our
grief...
in
our
brief
that
address
the
statute
of
limitations,
qualified
immunity,
the
insufficiency
of
the
petitioner's
allegations
of
municipal
liability.
but
unless
there
are
any
questions
on
those
or
the
other
matters
i've
raised
here,
i'll
leave
those
to
the
briefs.
