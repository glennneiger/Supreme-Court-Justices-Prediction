justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action
for
malicious
prosecution
in
the
state
of
illinois
have
a
bearing
on
any
one
of
those
three
rationales
that
you've
mentioned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
so
far...
and
that's
how
i
understood
your
second
point.
all
you
said
is
that
the
illinois
criminal
procedures
system
is
adequate
to
vindicate
the
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
account
for
the
malicious
prosecution
action
which
i'm
somewhat
surprised
that
is
missing
from
your
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
there
were
no
malicious
prosecution
action
in
the
state
of
illinois?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
relying
on
the
state
criminal
procedure
apparatus
to
vindicate
the
defendant's
rights,
correct?
