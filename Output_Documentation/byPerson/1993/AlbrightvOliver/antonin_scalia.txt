mr.
bisbee,
could
i
go
back
to
what
justice
o'connor
was
asking.
what...
why...
you
say
what
is
involved
here
is
freedom
to
be
free
from
arbitrary
government
action.
but
defamation
by
a
government
official,
let's
say
a
police
chief
who
issues
a
bulletin
saying
that
you're
a
criminal,
that's
arbitrary
government
action.
now,
what
deprivation
of
freedom
existed
here
that
did
not
exist
in
that
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
other
than
the
arrest.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
he
had
have
to
spend
money
to
defend
himself.
so
also
in
the
defamation
case,
you
have
to
spend
money
to
rehabilitate
his
reputation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what.
who
cares
about
processes
so
long
as
you're
not
under
arrest?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
thing
in
the
defamation
case.
you...
you're
reputation
is
ruined.
you
can't
get
a
job.
people
won't
hire
you.
you
have
to
spend
money
to
somehow
rehabilitate
your
reputation.
why
isn't
that
a
deprivation
of
liberty?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
thing
different,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
in
the
one
case
you're
arrested,
you
cannot
run
around
without
posting
a
bond
or
whatever.
whereas
in
the
other
case
you're
subjected
to
just
as
much
expense,
just
as
much
heartache,
just
as
much
inconvenience.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
organized
vengeance,
but
it
wreaks
that
vengeance
by
grabbing
your
body
and
throwing
it
into
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
there
are
restrictions
where
he
can
travel
on
his
release?
what
was
it,
don't
leave
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
arrest
over
once
he's
released
from
the
jailhouse,
even
though
he's
told
he
can't
leave
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
we
said
don't
leave
the
state
unless
we
tell
you
you
can,
that's
what
you
should
say.
don't
say
don't
leave
the
state,
just
say
don't
leave
the
state
unless
we
tell
you
you
can
leave
the
state,
right?
you
really
think
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
right
to
travel
now.
i'm
talking
about
arrest.
are
you
under
arrest
when
you're...
when
you're
released
from
the
jailhouse
but
cannot
leave
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
say
no,
my
next
question
is
going
to
be
what
if
you
can't
leave
the
city?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
you
needed
malice
for
the
state...
for
the
state
claim
to
be
sustained.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
false
arrest.
