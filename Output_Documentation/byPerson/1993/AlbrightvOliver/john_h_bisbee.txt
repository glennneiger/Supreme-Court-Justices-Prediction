mr.
john
h.
bisbee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--thank
you,
your
honor.
if
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
which
affords
a
cause
of
action
to
individuals
who
are
deprived
of
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
by
officials
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
this
court
has
frequently
admonished
and
instructed
that
those
of
us
litigating
these
cases
advise
of
the
specific
nature
of
the
right
protected.
the
right
protected
asserted
by
mr.
albright
in
this
case
is
the
right
to
liberty
secured
by
substantive
due
process.
this
court
has
further
admonished
and
instructed
counsel
that
when
a
right
protected...
or
liberty
right
protected
by
substantive
due
process
is
asserted,
that
the
party
declare...
delineate
with
some
degree
of
particularity
the
exact
nature
of
the
right.
and
the
exact
nature
of
the
right
that
mr.
albright
asserts
in
this
court
today,
your
honors,
is
the
right
to
be
free
of
a
criminal
prosecution
except
upon
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
that
the
individual
sought
to
be
made
the
party
defendant
committed
the
crime.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
chicago
held
that
we...
that
mr.
albright
did
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
the
court,
however,
did
state
that
the
actions
of
the
defendant,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
mr.
roger
oliver,
a
police
detective
with
the
city
of
macomb,
illinois
police
department,
a
city
of
about
25,000
people...
his
actions
were
shocking
and
that
they,
in
all
likelihood,
had
exceeded
the
boundaries
of
reasonableness
which
that
court
had--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor,
i
believe
if
that
charge
is
without
probable
cause...
it
is
without
deprivation
of
liberty,
but
the
court
need
not
reach
that
question
particularly
under
the
circumstances--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--a
defamatory
statement
by
a
government
official
does
not
deprive
liberty
because
it
does
not
deprive
any
right
protected
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
your
honor.
that
is
why.
the
charge...
the
invocation
of
criminal
process;
the
bringing
to
bear
of
the
most
severe
power
possessed
by
government
against
an
individual;
the
requirement
that
the
individual
at
that
point
do
whatever
is
necessary,
whether
it
be
the
posting
of
bond
with
the
state,
whether
it
be
the
securing
of
counsel,
whether
it
be
the
procuring
of
investigative
services,
whether
it
be
whatever
else
is
necessary
in
order
to
defend
not
just
his
reputation
but
his
very
liberty,
his
very
ability
to
lead
his
life
as
he
has
chosen
to
lead
his
life;
that
is
what
is
at
stake
at
that
point.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
if
the
mere
filing
of
it
is
without
probable
cause,
your
honor,
that
is
my
contention.
but
the
court
need
not
reach
that
issue.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
altogether
correct,
as
you
state,
that
the
police
officer's
original
and
customary
duty
is
to
make
the
arrest.
you're
also
absolutely
correct
that
the
criteria
in
the
fourth
amendment
governing
reasonable
searches
and
seizures
govern
his
actions.
but
with
all
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
your
statement
is
incomplete
in
that
in
most
jurisdictions,
including
illinois,
a
police
officer
plays
a
substantial
role
in
the
institution
of
the
criminal
charge
itself.
and
it
did
in
this
case.
and
most
often,
your
honor,
the
police
officer
is
the
one,
because
of
the
burdens
placed
upon
the
prosecutor's
office.
as
the
court
enunciated
so
clearly
in
imbler
v.
pachtman,
10,
15
years,
it
is
the
police
officer
who
is
the
one
who
is
privy
to
and
has
knowledge
of
the
investigative
sources,
the
people
who
are
able
to
give
him
information
as
to
when
crimes
are--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
the
predicate
of
your
question.
in
this
case
the
officer
attested
to
the
charging
document.
the
officer
did
far
more
than
simply
create
the
impetus
for
the
arrest.
he
attested
to
the
charging
document
itself.
he
attested
to
the
facts
that
he
asserted,
that
kevin
albright
had
sold
controlled
substances
to
someone
named
veda
moore.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
it
certainly
is
part
of
that.
but,
your
honor,
as
this
court
held
in
malley
v.
briggs,
the...
individuals
are
held
responsible
for
the
natural
consequences
of
their
actions.
and
certainly
a
police
officer
who
participates,
particularly
as
materially
as
detective
oliver
did,
in
the
attestation
to
the
criminal
charge,
has
begun
an
action
the
natural
consequence
of
which,
the
inevitable
consequence
of
which
is
going
to
be
the
criminal
prosecution.
and
in
this
case
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution,
we
allege,
without
probable
cause.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
probably
brinegar
v.
the
united
states.
a
close
second,
your
honor,
being--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--brinegar
v.
the
united
states,
decided
in
1949.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
it
certainly
did.
but
the
language...
the
dictum,
your
honor,
and
i
think
dictum
whereby
this
court
has
assumed
that
probable
cause
for
a
prosecution
is
necessary--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor,
it
came
awfully
close.
because
brinegar
did
say
that
the
probable
cause
standard
was
designed
to
prevent
unfounded
charges
of
crime
and
to
protect
the
individual
from
unfounded
charges
of
crime,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
arose
in
a
fourth
amendment
search
context
under
the
volstead
act,
or
something.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
i
think...
in
your
case...
in
this
situation,
your
honor,
the
answer
is
yes.
because
you
can
go
back.
in
a
linear...
in
a
linear
chronology,
going
back
to
hurtado
v.
california
in
1884
where
the
court
in
very
clear
terms...
when
it
said
that
a
grand
jury
was
not
necessary,
the
grand
jury
indictment
was
not
necessary
to
due
process,
nonetheless
said
that
the
core
value,
the
core
value
which
the
grand
jury
was
designed
to
protect,
namely
the
right
to
be
free
from
prosecution
except
upon
probable
cause,
was
very
much
a
part
of
the
individual
liberty.
and
you
take
that
type
of...
you
take
the
language
and
the
holding
in
hurtado
v.
california,
you
take
it
into
brinegar
v.
the
united
states,
and
you
tie
it
in,
then,
with
cases
like
ingraham
v.
wright,
which
is
the
student
paddling
case,
and
you
take
footnotes
41
and
42
and
you
have
the
court
coalescing,
coalescing
the
liberty
to
be
free
from
unwanted
infliction
of
state--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
the
dicta
in
those
cases
created
the
assumption
that
has
been
implicit
in
this
court's
decisions
from...
as
long...
as
far
back
as
1884
in
an
explicit
sense,
that
probable
cause
is
required
to
support
a
prosecution.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
yes.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
that's
because
it
was
a
fourth
amendment
case.
that's
because
the
case
involved
the
detention...
the
arrest
and
detention
of
the
individual
under
circumstances
of
excessive
force.
and--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--certainly.
but
we
don't
claim
any
excessive
force,
your
honor.
this
is
not
an
excessive
force
case,
as
was
graham.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
he
was
seized
without
probable
cause.
he
would
have--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--that
would
have
been.
but
we...
as
you--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--pardon...
excuse
me?
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
that
part
of
it
is.
but
that,
your
honor,
quite
honestly,
is
ancillary
to
the
essential
problem.
in
the
general
circumstance,
an
arrest,
or
a
search,
or
the
other
problems
protected
against
by
the
fourth
amendment
are
most
often
mere
incidents
of
what
is
really
at
stake
here,
and
that
is
the
invocation
of--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor,
it's
an
attribute
of
being
arrested
at
some
point.
as
this
court
said
in
graham
v.
connor,
at
some
point
to
the
time
of
charging,
at
which
time
the
due
process
clause
does
take
over.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
in
the...
the
easy
answer
to
that
in
this
case,
as
you
pointed
out,
was
that
the
statute
of
limitations
was
not
abided
by
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
and
therefore
he
had
no
fourth
amendment
claim.
he
could
not
do
it
because
the
cause
of
action
for
a
fourth
amendment
claim
accrued
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
so
we--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--maybe
so.
but
as
i
understood--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--i
didn't
argue
that
and
it's
not
how
i
understood
the
law.
because
i
did
understand
the
law
to
be
simply
that
the
cause
of
action
for
an
arrest,
whether
at
common
law
or
under
section
1983,
accrued
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
nevertheless,
your
honor...
and
the
point
is
that
graham
v.
connor
was
explicit
that
at
some
point...
now,
whether
we're
talking
about
something
metaphysical
here
or
not,
i
don't
know.
but
at
some
point
after
the
arrest
has
taken
place,
the
due
process
clause
does
take
over.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
those
too
are
money
issues,
those
too
are
property
issues.
property
issues
certainly
are
not
irrelevant
to
this
claim,
and
they're
certainly
not--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--not
necessarily
so,
but
they
are
alleged
in
the
complaint
in
this
case.
but,
your
honor,
i
do
believe--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--well,
we
believe
they
are,
your
honor,
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
liberty
to
be
free
from
a
prosecution,
with
all
of
its
attendant
consequences,
is...
entails--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--but
that's
a
specific
prohibition.
here
liberty
is
the
broad
majestic
term.
liberty
is
the
term
that
is...
that
is
customarily
used,
and
liberty
is
the
term
that
falls--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--well,
certainly
there
is,
your
honor.
but
there
is...
that
is
a
separate
prohibition.
and
we
have
here...
under
the
liberty
rubric
we
have
several...
the
essential
problem
that
is
created
in
a
situation
like
this
is
the
freedom
of
the
individual
from
the
arbitrary
conduct
of
the
government.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
that's
so.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
we,
your
honor,
you
know
there's
certainly
superficial
appeal
to
that
position.
i
sympathize
with
it.
it
is
not,
however,
altogether
complete
for
the
simple
reason
that
oftentimes
it
is
the
police
officer
who
is
the
one
most
privy
to
what
it
is
that
constitutes
a
crime.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
in
which
case
the
police--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--no,
he
shouldn't
be,
and
i
don't
think
he
would
be
because
there--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--he
would...
if
what
the
police
officer
presented
to
the
prosecutor
is
within
the
realm
of
what
the
court
talked
about
as
being
within
the
realm
of
objective
reasonableness
in
malley
v.
briggs,
the
police
officer
would
not
be
liable.
there
would
be
no
causation.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
we
rest
the
claim
on
the
right
to
travel
as
an
incident
of
the
liberty.
i
suppose
the
right
to
travel
in
this
case,
because
kevin
albright
alleged
that
he
sought
to
go
to
st.
louis,
missouri
for
purposes
of
seeking
job
prospects,
could
be
construed
also
as
property,
and
sometimes
those
lines
blur.
we
would
consider
that
a
liberty
right.
i
think
it's
been
held
by
this
court
in
any
number
of
cases
to
be
a
liberty
right.
it
is
implicit
in
the
broader
liberty.
i
believe
i
indicated
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
i
had
more
or
less
focused
on
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
do
believe
it
to
be
a
incident
of
the
broader
liberty
we're
talking
about,
the
freedom
from
arbitrary
governmental
conduct,
which
is
really
what
happens
when
you
have
the
invocation
of
the
state
criminal
process
under
circumstances
where
there
is
no
probable
cause.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
i
believe...
you
may
be
correct.
i
can't
remember
at
this
moment,
your
honor.
but
certainly
the
aspect...
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
i'll
concede
that
certainly,
your
honor.
and
if...
if,
indeed,
there
is
any
failure
to
mention
the
freedom
to
travel
in
the
brief,
then
i
was
remiss
in
failing
to
do
so.
it
was,
i
know,
however,
specified
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
in
which
i
indicated
that
the
right
to
travel
is
but
an
incident
of
the
broader
liberty
here
that
we
assert.
the
broader
liberty
that
comes
in
under
the
various
criteria
of
substantive
due
process
which
this
court
has
always...
has
protected,
has
set
forth.
the
concepts
of...
being
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
deeply
rooted
in
our
nation's
history
and
traditions.
and
most
importantly
in
this
case,
the
freedom
from
arbitrary
governmental
conduct.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
it
was...
your
honor,
it
was
dismissed
with
leave,
without
prejudice,
under
the
provisions
of
rule
41(a)(1),
(2),
or
something
like
that,
without
prejudice.
however...
and
with
due
respect
to
the
resourcefulness
of
my
opposing
counsel,
illinois
has
a
statute
of
limitations
whereby
claims
against
municipal
employees
must
be
brought
within
1
year.
so
the
statute
of
limitations
in
our...
i
don't
want
to
make
a
total
judicial
concession
here,
but
the
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
the
claim
against
oliver
under
a
common
law
malicious
prosecution
theory
probably
also
is
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
but
it
is...
it
has
not
been
formally
dismissed.
there
is
leave
to
reinstate
it
if
need
be.
i
don't
have...
i'm
not
sanguine
about
its
prospects
if
it
is
reinstated.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
that
did
create
a
final
judgment,
your
honor,
correct.
but
it's...
but
that
wasn't
an
academic
final
judgment
because
i
am
not
sanguine
at
all
about
the
prospects
for
the
common
law
malicious
prosecution
claim.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
did
not
argue
that,
your
honor.
i
did
not
believe
that
to
be
the
law.
i
did
not
think
that
would
be
a
good
faith
argument.
i
think
that
the
proper
argument
that
i
have
to
make
in
this
case--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--as
i
understand
the...
as
i
understood
the
law
at
that
time.
now,
i
may
be
being
educated
at
this
very
moment,
but
as
i
understood
the
law
at
that
time,
the
cause
of
action
for
a
false
arrest
accrued
at
the
moment
of
the
arrest.
and
the
2
years
had
expired
by
the
time
the
case
came
to
my
attention,
came
to
me.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor,
the
processes
of
the
state
are
not
invoked
in
any
formal
sense
in
the
case
of
an
incidental
defamation
by
someone
who
happens--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--who...
your
honor,
who
cares
about
processes
when
you're
facing
the
prospect
of
jail,
when
you're
facing
the
prospect
of
punishment,
when
you're
facing--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor,
that
may
be
the
situation.
that
may
be
the
most
onerous
of
situations--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--which
attains
in
the
defamation
situation.
however,
it
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
what
happens
when
the
state
begins
criminal
process.
when
the
state
attempts
in
a
systematic...
the
criminal
law,
after
all,
your
honor--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--justice
scalia,
as
you
well
know,
you
know
as
a
scholar
of
the
law,
the
criminal
law
is
nothing
more
than
the
organized
vengeance
of
the
state.
and
that
has
what
has...
that
is
what
has
been
wrought
against
the
individual
when
criminal
processes
commence.
that
doesn't
happen
with
the
incidental
publication
of
a
flyer.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor,
as
this
court
said
a
long
time
ago...
and
maybe
the
case
has
been
decimated
beyond
any...
any
practical
value
at
this
time,
but
in
boyd
v.
the
united
states
this
court
said
that
the
incidents
of
arrest
and
the
search
and
the
seizure
and
things
of
that
sort
are
mere
incidents
of
aggravation
to
what
happens
when
the
individual
becomes
the
victim
of
the
organized
vengeance
of
the
state.
and
that
is
what
has
been
happen...
that's
what
happens
in
the
case
of
a
prosecution.
that
is
what
happens
in
the
case
of
a
prosecution
when
there
is
no
buffer,
no
buffer
like
probable
cause.
and
that
is
the
rule
that
we
ask
this
court
to
adopt.
and
i
notice
that
my
time
is
running
short.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time,
if
i
may,
please,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
thank
you.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
it's
not
out
of
the
case.
i
am
not
urging...
i
am
urging
reversal
of
the
judgment
against
the
city
of
macomb.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
now,
let
me
see
if
i...
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
that's
correct.
we
have
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
the
city
council
and
the
mayor
delegated
to
officer
oliver
the
right
to
make
all
final
determinations
in
terms
of
how
to
effect
and
how
to
enforce
the
illinois
laws
relative
to
controlled
substances
within
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
macomb.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
and
by
further
answer
to
that,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
raised
within
the...
it's
contemplated
within
the
question
presented
on
certiorari.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
wouldn't
think
so,
and
i
should
have
answered
that
quickly.
your
honor,
one...
mr.
chief
justice,
one
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out.
i
was
not
as
remiss
as
i
thought
when
i
advised
you
that
i
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
travel
in
the
brief.
at
page
7
of
the
petitioner's
brief
we
do
set
forth
in
the
statement
of
facts
that
a
standard
condition
of
his
bond
prohibit
him
from
traveling
outside
the
state
of
illinois.
and
on
page
18
of
the
brief
we
made
mention
again
of
the
other
conditions
imposed
upon
his
liberty.
so
the
point
was
raised.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
not
as
a
separate
constitutional
claim
of
right
to
travel,
except
as
set
forth
in
the
complaint.
it
was
the
petitioner's
assumption
that
it
was
subsumed
within
the
general
and
broader
liberty.
and
another
point
i
did
not
address
in
responding
to
justice
souter's
questions
as
to
the
liberties
going
beyond
the
purely
property
interests
that...
which
he
pointed
out
to
me.
the
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
cases
point
out
precisely
the
types
of
liberties
that
are
imposed
when
someone
is
prosecuted.
and,
indeed,
in
barker
v.
wingo
the
triggering
point
of
the
prejudice
is
a
certain
passage
of
time
which...
whereby
prejudice
is
assumed.
and
in
united
states
v.
lovasco,
this
court
said
that
the
mere
filing
of
prosecution
creates
the
anxiety
and
the
other
things
which
necessarily
impose
upon
an
individual's
liberty
who
is
subjected
to
the
organized
vengeance
of
the
state.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor,
i
hope
that
i
am
not
understood
as
saying
that.
i
hope
that
i
am
understood
as
saying
what
the
chief
justice
indicated
in
daniels
v.
williams,
that
the
due
process
clause
protects
against
the...
or
involves
the
large
interests
of
the
governors
and
the
governed.
and
there
is
not
a
larger
interest
of
the
governors
and
the
governed
than
the
prosecution
of
an
individual.
and,
indeed--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--as
i
understand
bivens,
your
honor,
it
came
about
simply
because
there
was
not
a...
an
analogue
to
section
1983
which
covers
federal...
federal
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights
committed
by
federal
officials.
that
is
the
real
gravamen
of
bivens.
here
we
have
the
situation
where
there
is
a
specific
statute
designed
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
which,
in
turn,
was
designed
to
enforce
the
results
of
the
civil
war,
and
made
applicable
to
prevent
state
officials
from
abridging
rights
protected
by
the
constitution.
and
the
right
to
be
free
from
a
prosecution
without
probable
cause,
far
from
what
mr.
sotos
said
to
the
court
a
moment
ago,
as
a
new
right...
it
is
not
a
new
right,
it
is
a
right
which
has
been--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--well,
i
don't
know
why
the
court
did
what
it
did
in
bivens
in
that
respect,
your
honor,
except
to
say
that
all
elements,
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
and
the
sixth
amendments
all
combine
to
create
and
delineate
the
contours
of
the
liberty
which
is
protected
in
these
situations
from
a
prosecution.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
