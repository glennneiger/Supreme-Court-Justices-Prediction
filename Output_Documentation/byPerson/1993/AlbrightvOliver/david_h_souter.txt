all
right,
assuming
it
does
and
assuming
that
we
were
to
accept
your
position
by
approaching
the
case
not
on
the
assumption
that
justice
ginsburg
has
questioned
on,
but
on
the
assumption
that
somehow
there
is
an
independent
set
of
interests
at
stake,
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
in
which
you
were
telling,
sort
of,
what
the...
what
the
consequences
were,
were
all
property
consequences.
so
that
even
if
we
accept
your
analysis,
aren't
you
making,
not
a
substantive
due
process
claim
based
on
liberty,
but
a
substantive
due
process
claim
based
on
property?
you
know,
he
had
to
put
up
bail,
he
had
to
hire
counsel
and
so
on.
those
are
all
money
issues.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
don't
turn
it
into
a
liberty
claim,
do
they,
independent
of
the
liberty
interest
implicated
by
the
arrest
and
its
consequences
for
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
that.
but,
i
mean,
are
they
consistent?
if
you
don't
accept
justice
ginsburg's
analysis,
then
are
the
consequences
that
you're
resting
on
consistent
with
a
liberty
due
process
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then
under
the
takings
clause
we've
got
a
liberty
interest
because
the
property
owner
has
a
liberty
interest
in
being
free
from
improper
takings.
i
mean,
if
that's
going
to
be
the
analysis,
everything
would
be
subsumed
under
liberty
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
some
majesty
in
property
under
due
process?
