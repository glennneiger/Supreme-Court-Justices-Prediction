no.
92-833,
kevin
albright
v.
roger
oliver.
mr.
bisbee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wait
just
a
minute,
mr.
bisbee.
spectators
should
not
talk
while
they
remain
in
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
contention
is
that
even
though
he
is
never
arrested
on
the
criminal
charge,
that
the
mere
filing
of
it
deprives
him
of
liberty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
closest
decision
of
this
court,
mr.
bisbee,
that
supports
your
contention
that
the
interests
of
the
defendant
in
not
being
prosecuted
on
probable
cause
is
a
substantive
liberty
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
first
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
didn't...
that
dealt
with
the
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
brinegar
was
a
case
in
a
federal
court
and
the
dicta
certainly
didn't
say
that
not
being...
freedom
from
prosecution
without
probable
cause
is
a
substantive
liberty
interest,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
we
should
then
go
through
all
our
cases
that
explain
the
reason
for
the
adoption
of,
say,
the
fourth
amendment
or
the
fifth
amendment,
and
say
that
all
of
those
reasons
become
substantive
liberty
interests?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
taking
three
cases,
all
of
which
were
decided
against
the
claimant
of
constitutional
rights,
and
saying
that
dicta
in
them
have
created
a
new
constitutional
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
didn't
mention
in--
--mr.
bisbee,
you
don't
mention
anywhere
in
your
brief
on
the
merits
any
right
to
travel,
your
blue
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
be
alleged
in
the
complaint,
but
the
complaint
was
a
couple
of
years
ago
back
in
the
district
court.
your
opponent
here
is
entitled
to
judge
what
he
has
to
respond
to
by
the
terms
of
the
brief
you
file
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bisbee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sotos,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
you
would
argue
at
least
that
before
a
defendant
subject
to
that
sort
of
a
bond
could
raise
the
question,
he
would
have
had
to
go
and
see
if
he
might
have
been
allowed
to
leave
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sotos.
mr.
bisbee,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
where
is
that
in
your
question...
your
question
presented
certainly
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
judgment
against
the
city
of
macomb.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
not
for
us
to
decide.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
never
raise
it
as
the...
as
a
claim
of
a
constitutional
right
to
travel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bisbee.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
last
of
the
four
cases
which
i
have
to
announce
is
albright
against
oliver,
no.92-833.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
recognizes
a
substantive
right
to
be
free
from
criminal
prosecution
except
upon
probable
cause.
upon
learning
that
an
arrest
warrant
had
been
issued
charging
him
with
the
crime
of
selling
a
substance
that
looked
like
an
illegal
drug,
petitioner,
kevin
albright
in
illinois,
surrendered
to
respondent,
roger
oliver,
a
policeman,
and
was
released
after
posting
bond.
later
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
the
policeman,
oliver,
testified
that
albright
sold
a
look-a-like
substance
to
a
confidential
informant
and
the
court
found
probable
cause
to
bind
albright
over
for
trial.
however,
the
court
later
dismissed
the
action
because
the
charge
did
not
state
an
offense
under
illinois
law.
albright
then
filed
this
suit
under
section
1983
alleging
that
oliver
deprived
him
of
substantive
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
be
free
from
criminal
prosecution
except
on
probable
cause.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
against
him.
in
deciding
this
case,
we
have
produced
a
veritable
cornucopia
of
opinions.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
with
the
clerk,
joined
by
justices
o'connor,
scalia,
and
ginsburg
which
concludes
that
albright's
claimed
right
to
be
free
from
prosecution
without
probable
cause
must
be
judged
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
not
the
vague
area
of
substantive
due
process.
since
albright
asserted
only
the
latter,
his
claim
must
fail.
justice
scalia
and
ginsburg
have
filed
separate
concurring
opinions;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
is
joined
by
justice
thomas;
justice
souter
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
