justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bisbee.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
it
that
the
mere
filing
of
a
criminal
charge
without
more
should
constitute
a
deprivation
of
liberty?
the
state
is
just
saying
we
have
cause
to
believe
that
you,
john
jones,
committed
a
crime.
now,
why
is
that
a
deprivation
of
liberty
at
that
stage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
should
it
be,
in
light
of
holdings
that,
for
instance,
a
defamatory
statement
by
a
government
official
would
not
constitute
a
deprivation
of
liberty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bisbee,
it
could
well
be
that
the
police
officer
just
sees
what
he
sees
and
reports
it
to
the
prosecutor
without
being
negligent
or
deficient
or
misleading,
and
the
prosecutor
makes
a
decision
to
proceed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
the
police
officer
be
liable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
absent
any
misleading
or
misconduct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
something
else.
to
what
extent
do
you
rest
your
claim
on
the
deprivation
of
the
right
to
travel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so,
mr.
sotos,
you
take
the
view,
then,
that
if
the
officer
makes
an
arbitrary
arrest
without
probable
cause
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
violation
simply
because
the
state
has
its
criminal
procedures
to
take
care
of
these
things?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
there
might
be
a
valid
substantive
due
process
claim
made
on
the
basis
of
travel
restrictions
that
are
imposed
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
arrest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
it
results
in
an
order
saying
you
can't
leave
and
all
of
this
was
obtained
on
the
basis
of
an
unlawful
arrest,
is
there...
is
there
some
deprivation
of
the
right
to
travel
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
suppose
that
is
the
allegation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
okay
to
enter
such
an
order
even
though
it
is
based
on
an
arrest
made
without
probable
cause.
that
makes
it
okay.
