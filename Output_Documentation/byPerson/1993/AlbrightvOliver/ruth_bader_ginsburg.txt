justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bisbee,
he
was
arrested,
and
police
officers
don't
prosecute,
they
arrest.
and
what
troubles
me
about
the
case
you're
bringing
is
you
start
out
with
a
potential
fourth
amendment
claim,
an
analogy
to
the
common
law
false
arrest.
that's
what
the
police
officer
does
and
that's
what
he's
responsible
for.
and
then
you're
shifting
over
to
substantive
due
process
because
you
missed
out
on
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
fourth
amendment
governs
the
police
officer's
conduct.
it
says
thou
shalt
not
seize
unreasonably
without
probable
cause.
why
isn't
that
the
rubric
under
which
this
case
should
be
treated?
why
should
we
suddenly
get
into
a
new
territory
simply
because
the
action
was
started
arguably
too
late?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
police
officer
doing
other
than
backing
up
his
arrest?
he
made
an
arrest
and
then
the
person
technically
is
in
arrest
status
until
the
criminal
case
is
over.
he's
released
on
bond,
but
he
is
technically
arrested
for
the
duration
of
that
procedure.
so
why
does
the
police
officer's
participation
shift
from
the
arrest...
initial
arrest,
and
then
whatever
statements
he
makes
thereafter
is
consistent
with
maintaining
the
arrest,
rather
than
shifting
the
police
officer
from
the
role
of
police
officer
to
the
role
of
prosecutor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
couldn't
that
be
regarded
simply
as
consistent
with
and
perpetuating
the
arrest
status
of
the
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bisbee,
are
you
familiar
with
graham
against
connor,
a
1989
decision
of
this
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
seemed
to
me
similar
in
that
there
was
an
argument
that
we
shift
from
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
court
said
no,
this
entire
case
should
be
analyzed
as
a
fourth
amendment
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
mr.
albright
seized
throughout...
from
the
time
that
he
first
showed
up
until
the
time
that
that
criminal
charge
was
dropped,
wasn't
he
technically
seized?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
you
were
claiming
that
he
was
seized
without
probable
cause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
without...
you
can
do
it
as
gently
as
possible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
can
do
it
entirely
gently.
if
you
have
no
reason
to
arrest
a
person,
it's
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
is
it
an
incident
that
the
person
is
in
a
state
of
seizure
until
the
criminal
prosecution
is
dropped.
he's
out
on
bond
but
he's
got
restrictions,
and
all
that
is
an
attribute
of
being
arrested.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
can
understand
your
argument
if
the
arrest
started
at
a
certain
point
and
stopped,
and
then
the
charge
started
at
a
certain
point.
but
if,
what
i
thought
i
heard
you
to
say,
the
seizure,
the
arrest
does
indeed
continue,
that
the
person
remains
in
a
state
of
arrest
until
the
criminal
charge
is
dropped,
then
i
don't
understand
why
we
go
from
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
do
you...
you
take
that
to
be
gospel.
is
it
necessary...
necessarily
so?
if
one
conceives
of
the
arrest
as
continuing
until
the
criminal
charges
are
dismissed,
then
maybe
the
statute
of
limitations
should
have
started
ticking
later
rather
than
earlier.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
argue
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
can't
go
after
the
prosecutor.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
odd
that
you're
going
after
the
police
officer
whose
main
job
is
to
arrest
for
a
prosecution
because
you
can't
go
against
the
prosecutor?
something
doesn't
quite
fit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bisbee,
you
are
making
a
constitutional
tort
analogue
for
the
common
law
tort
of
malicious
prosecution.
but
you
had
a
diversity
case
and
you
had
a
malicious
prosecution
common
law
claim
which
you
dropped.
why
did
you...
why
did
you
drop
the
malicious
prosecution
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying
one
reason...
one
reason
was
the
statute
of
limitations.
was
the
other
reason
so
you
could
have
a
final
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
never
did
argue
that
on
the...
on
the
false
arrest,
or
fourth
amendment
arrest
without
probable
cause,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
might
have
run
from
the
dismissal
of
the
charges
rather
than
from
the
date
of
the
arrest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
good
faith
argument...
you
think
it's
meritless
to
say
that
the
statute
of
limitations
might
have
run
from
when
the
arrest
ended
rather
than
from
when
the
arrest
started?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sotos,
isn't
a
criminal
defendant
technically
in
a
state
of
arrest,
whether
he's
out
on
bond,
until
the
proceeding
concludes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't...
isn't,
even
on
the
civil
side,
the
historical
notion
that
the
sheriff
tags
a
person,
brings
that
person
before
the
tribunal,
and
that
seizure
is
what
gives
the
tribunal
authority?
is
it
we're
civilized,
so
we
allow
the
defendant
in
the
civil
case
to
be
at
liberty,
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
at
bond,
but
technically
the
seizure
continues
until
the
proceeding
is
over?
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
this
case
you
say
there
was
never
really
any
arrest.
you
wouldn't
even
say
that
there
was
an
arrest,
because
this
person
understood
that
there
was
a
warrant
out
for
him
and
came
in
voluntarily.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
thought
that
that
was
accepted
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
moment
of
that
arrest,
since
he
wasn't...
he
wasn't,
in
fact,
seized
by
a
police
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
think...
the
criminal
defendant
has
asked
the
question;
are
you
arrested
after
the
charge
is
lodged?
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
no,
i'm
no
longer
arrested.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whether
the
arrest
technically
persists
until
the
end,
certainly
the
effects
of
the
arrest
continue
until
the
person
is
discharged,
until
the
indictment
is
dismissed...
or
the
information,
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
my
question.
doesn't
the
arrest
persist
in
the
sense
that
he's
still
under
the
restraint
of
the
arrest,
can't
leave
the
state
without
court
permission?
the
allegation
here
is
he
didn't
seek
the
court's
permission
because
it
would
have
been
expensive,
his
lawyer's
clock
would
have
been
ticking
for
the
time
that
the
application
was
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
is
doesn't
that
restraint
show
that
the
arrest
is,
indeed,
continuing,
that
he
can't
leave
the
state
without
getting
permission
from
the
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
weren't
arrested,
why
would
he
need
the
state's
permission?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
cannot
leave
the
state
unless
the
court
permits
you
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
wasn't
asking
about
a
fundamental
right
to
travel.
i
was
and
i'm
still
concerned
about
the
status
of
this
person
as
an
arrested
person,
and
whether
that's
an
indication
that
maybe
he's
still
under
arrest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
he
couldn't
make
bail
so
that
he
was
actually
incarcerated,
would
his
claim
be
a
fourth
amendment
or
fifth
amendment
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
was
time
barred,
and
that's
why
it
was
dropped?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
without
prejudice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
you
can
clarify
whether
you're
urging
here
reversal
of
the
judgment
against
the
city...
the
city
of
macomb,
or
is
that
out
of
the
case
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
basis
of
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
understood
that
the...
the
city
of
macomb
was
out
of
it
because
there
was
no
pattern
or
practice
or
something
to
establish--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bisbee,
you
are
taking
the
constitutional
tort
enunciated
in
bivens
and
you're
fitting
it
precisely
to
the
common
law
mold.
it
seems
to
me
that
diminishes
the
notion
of
a
constitutional
tort
to
say,
well,
it
comes
in
pieces,
and
so
here
is
the
false
arrest
piece
and
here's
the
malicious
prosecution
piece,
and
we
make
it
coincide
precisely
with
the
common
law
tort
development.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
whole
thing
should...
bivens
even
should
have
been
under...
instead
of
the
fourth
amendment,
should
have
been
under
due
process
because
it's
this
encompassing
concept.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't...
i
understand
what
you
said,
that
there
was
nothing...
no
statute
between
the
constitution
and
the
claim.
here
there
is
1983.
but
in
terms
of
the
notion
of
the
constitutional
basis
for
it,
why
didn't
bivens
then
go
to
the
fifth
amendment
instead
of
the
fourth
amendment?
