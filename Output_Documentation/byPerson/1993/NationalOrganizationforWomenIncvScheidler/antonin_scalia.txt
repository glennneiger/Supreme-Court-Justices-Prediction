ms.
clayton,
it
isn't
really
the
predicate
acts
so
much
that
we're
concerned
about,
as
the
organization
which
allegedly
is
supposed
to
have
committed
the
predicate
acts.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
congress
does
use
the
word
"enterprise"
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
one
of
the
popular
proposals
that's
given
political
discussion
nowadays
is
so-called
enterprise
zones.
what
do
you
think
they
relate
to,
4-h
clubs,
voluntary
associations,
or
commercial
associations
essentially?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
free
enterprise,
the
term
"free
enterprise"
is
used
the
same
way.
it
doesn't
mean,
you
know,
freedom
to
associate;
it
means
freedom
to
conduct
business
activities.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
of...
one
of
the
meanings
of
"enterprise"
at
least,
one
of
the
possible
meanings
of
"enterprise"
does
have
a
commercial
element
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
define
it.
now,
it
defines
a
number
of
terms
in
1961
where
it
says
"racketeering
activity
means",
and
it
says
what
racketeering
activity
means.
but
for
enterprise
it
says
"enterprise
includes"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
then
it
lists
a
number
of
things
it
includes:
an
individual
partnership,
corporation,
association,
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
suppose
the...
suppose
the
word...
just
to
make
the
point
i'm
asking
you
about
clearer,
suppose
that
the
phrase
used
were
not
"enterprise"
alone
but
"business
enterprise".
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
yeah,
and
if
that
were
the
case
and
you
had
this
same
what
you
call
definition
in
1961(4),
suppose
it
read,
"business
enterprise"
includes
any
individual
partnership,
corporation,
association,
and
whatnot,
would
you
think
that
to
say
it
included
all
of
those
things
would
mean
that
it
read
out
the
business,
the
word
"business"?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
depends
on
whether
you
think
enterprise--
justice
antonin
scalia
--has
a
business
connotation
to
it
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
point
is
that
if
you
believe
that
1961(4)
alone
would
not
eliminate
the
business
connotation
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it
didn't
want...
it
didn't
business
there
because
they
didn't
think
it
had
to
be
a
business,
but
it
had
to...
still
had
to
have
a
commercial
motivation,
which
is
what
"enterprise"
connotes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
had
an
antitrust
claim
below,
didn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
the
antitrust
laws
don't
say
anything
about
commercial
motivation
either,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
do
we...
do
we
apply
them
against,
let's
say,
grape
boycotts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
a
group
of
citizens
for
political
reasons
wants
to
boycott
grapes,
that's
certainly
a
contract
combination
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade.
do
we
apply
the
antitrust
law
to
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
boycott's
not
speech.
it's
an
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
words
"trade
or
commerce"
have
a
business
aspect
to
them
too,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
those
are
some
of
your
claims.
but
you
assert
that
you
would...
you
would
have
a
right
to
win
here
if
you...
if
you
proved
acts
of
extortion--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
you
would
define
to
include
acts
which
intimidate
someone
into...
simply
into
not
doing
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
extortion
doesn't
even
mean
you
have
to
get
money
or
property
from
someone,
in
your
view.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
just
intimidating
them
into
not
doing
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
getting
it
is
the
same
as
somebody
else
giving
it
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
always,
just
for
purposes
of
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
say
that
i
want
to
stop
somebody...
just
to
take
it
out
of
the
abortion
context,
which
tends
to
inflame...
inflame
emotions,
suppose
i
want
to
get
somebody
to
stop
selling
grapes
and
i
throw
pickets
across
the
street.
and
simply
in
order
to
save...
to
save...
urging
other
people
to
boycott.
simply
in
order
to
save
money,
the
supermarket,
whoever,
says
it's
just
not
worth
it,
we
won't
sell
grapes.
they've
been
intimidated
from
selling
grapes,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
an
opinion
by--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
judge
friendly,
and
a
pretty
good
panel.
judge
oaks,
right,
and
who
was
the
third
one,
judge
feinberg,
chief
judge
feinberg?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
turkette
say
about
enterprise?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you...
how
do
you,
mr.
estrada,
explain
our
more
limited
scope
accorded
to
the
sherman
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
expanding
that
to
the
limit
of
the
meaning
of
its
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
supports
the
interpretation
of
extortion
that
the
court
below
adopted
as
well,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
to
say
you
don't
have
to
obtain
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is...
it
is
an
issue
which,
if...
if
supported,
would
sustain
the
judgment
below,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
we
could
entertain
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
estrada,
why
i'm
concerned
about
it
is
that
the
combination
of
that
broad
interpretation
of
extortion,
plus
the
interpretation
of
rico
that
the
petitioners
favor
here,
leaves
one
in
a
situation
where
any...
any
national
organization
which
has
adherents
and
hangers-on
who
may
commit
a
tort,
hitting
someone
with
a
picket
sign
or
trespassing
upon
property,
by
committing
an
unlawful
act
can
be
charged
with
committing
extortion
even
though
they're
not
trying
to
get
money.
and
this
means
that
any...
any
national
organization
demonstrating
for
some
political
cause
exposes
itself
to
lawsuits
nationwide...
which
they
may
win,
but
they
may
lose,
but
it's
an
enormous
amount
of
expense...
by
people
claiming
that
that
is
the
very
purpose
of
the
organization,
to
extort.
and
it
makes...
if
it
were
applied
to
the
naacp
in
the
days
of
civil
rights
activism,
it
would
have
been
very
debilitating.
does
it
not
concern
you
that
the
combination
of
the
two
can
have
that
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
simply
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
your
test,
mr.
blakey,
and
both
the
government
and
the
petitioner
assert
that
it's...
it's
too
confusing
to
work
with.
what
is
your
test
about
whether
the
requirement
of
commerciality,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
is
satisfied?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
do
i
know
whether
it's
an
enterprise
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me...
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
union
trust
fund
would
be
an
example,
i
presume.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
certainly
one
of
the
things
they
were
concerned
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
commercial
is
really
not
the
right
word.
i
mean,
you
would
also
apply
it
to
a...
to
a
terrorist
group
that
robs
banks,
i
assume,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
strange
to
call
that
a
commercial
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
you
have
to
give
away
enterprise.
you
have
to
give
away
your
enterprise
argument.
i
mean,
you
can
rely
on
affairs,
but
you've
given
away
enterprise,
because
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
pull
a
bunch
of
free
enterprises
and
a
bunch
of
bank
robbers.
enterprise
zones
is
not...
is
not
bank
robbers.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
would
certainly
feel
betrayed
if
i
were
one
of
the
senators
who
favored
a
broader
statute
and
the
aclu
came
in
with
objections
and
i
conceded
well,
okay,
to
meet
your
objections
what
we'll
do
is
we'll
narrow
the
crime;
we'll
just
have
certain
types
of
crimes
instead
of
other
crimes.
and
i
thought
that
was
the
deal,
and
the
aclu
says,
yeah,
that's
good
enough,
okay,
and
then
we
all
go
home,
and
then
it
turns
out
that
by
narrowing
the
crimes
i've
also
changed
the
meaning
of
the
word
"affairs".
justice
antonin
scalia
or
i've
changed
the
meaning
of
the
word
"enterprise".
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
a
deal
is
a
deal.
if
that's
what...
if
that's
how
they
meant
to
narrow
the
statute,
that
ought
to
be
narrow
enough.
and
the
argument
you
must
rely
on,
then,
is
that
this
is
not
extortion.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be,
but
i
think
the
point
he's
using
them
for...
and
this
statute
is
modeled
after
the
treble
damage
actions
in
the
antitrust
laws.
what
he's
using
them
for
is
to
show
that
in
another
area
we
have
imported
an
extratextual
limitation
upon
the
statute.
now
for
whatever
reasons,
first
amendment
reasons,
whatever
reasons,
the
point
is
it
is
an
extratextual
limitation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
restrains
trade
to
have
a
grape
boycott.
that
certainly
restrains
trade.
