92-780,
the
national
organization
for
women
versus
joseph
scheidler.
the
petitioner
is
the
national
organization
for
women
and
others,
alleged
that
the
respondents,
who
are
a
coalition
of
anti-abortion
groups
called
"the
pro-life
action
network"
and
others,
were
members
of
a
nationwide
conspiracy
to
shutdown
abortion
clinics.
the
petitioners
charged
that
these
respondents
conspired
to
use
threatened
or
actual
force,
violence
or
fear
to
induce
clinic
employees,
doctors,
and
patients
to
give
up
their
jobs,
their
right
to
practice
medicine,
and
their
right
to
obtain
an
abortion,
all
in
violation
of
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act,
nicknamed
for
acronym
rico.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
this
action,
saying
that
an
economic
motive
is
required
in
order
to
bring
a
legal
action
like
this.
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
that
rico
contains
an
implicit
economic
motive
requirement.
nowhere
in
either
section
1962(c)
of
the
act
or
section
1961's
definition
of
enterprise
and
pattern
or
racketeering
activity.
is
there
any
indication
that
such
an
economic
requirement
is
required?
we
find
that
the
statutory
language
is
unambiguous
and
there
is
no
clearly
expressed
intent
of
a
contrary
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
warrant
a
different
construction,
nor
is
there
any
ambiguity
in
this
language
that
we
have
been
talking
about
that
would
suffice
to
invoke
the
rule
of
lenity,
applicable
to
a
criminal
statute.
we,
therefore,
hold
that
rico
contains
no
economic
motive
requirement,
and
petitioners
may
maintain
this
action
if
the
respondents
indeed
conducted
the
enterprise
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
so,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.

souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion

by
justice
kennedy.
