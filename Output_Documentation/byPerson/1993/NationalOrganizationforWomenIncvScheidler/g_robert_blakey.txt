mr.
g.
robert
blakey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
appeal
is
about
a
misguided
effort
by
two
clinics
to
invoke
two
federal
statutes,
two
powerful
federal
statutes,
the
hobbs
act
and
rico,
in
the
context
of
a
social
protest
movement.
under
their
construction
of
the
statute,
it
would
be
applicable
not
only
to
a
gotti
or
a
king,
but
to
a
ghandi
or
a
chavez.
that's
a
result
the
congress
specifically
intended
to
avoid
in
1970.
this
appeal
runs
squarely
into
four...
three
rock-like
noes:
no
extortion,
no
economic
motive,
and
no
standing.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
question
of
extortion.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
let
me
answer
your
second
question
first,
your
honor.
the
question
of
standing
is
always
before
this
court.
it
is
jurisdictional.
even
if
not
raised
below,
you
must
face
it
here.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
to
my
knowledge...
your
honor,
the
posture
of
this
case
changed
over
time.
for
example,
at
the
time
it
was
in
the
circuit
court
now
was
a
plaintiff
under
the
antitrust
statute
and
had
standing.
when
this
court
declined
to
grant
cert
on
the
antitrust
question,
now
then
no
longer
was
a
plaintiff
in
the
antitrust
count,
and
its
lack
of
standing
in
this
court
is
directly
related
to
the
fact
that
it
is
not
a
plaintiff
in
the
rico
count.
that's
something
that
could
not
have
been
raised
in
the
lower
court
simply
because
their
lack
of
standing
on
rico
was
not
involved
in
their
original
petition.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
if
it
is
appearing
as
a
representative
of
either
the...
she
is
appearing
as
a
representative
of
the
two
clinics.
now
has
no
standing.
we
would
quarrel
with
the
standing,
first,
of
now
because
it
is
not
a
rico
plaintiff.
we
would
quarrel
with
the
standing
of
now
in
behalf
of
anyone
else.
this
case
was
not
certified
as
a
class.
they
must
first--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes,
but
even
on
the
face
of
this
complaint,
and
certainly
in
light
of
the
facts
set
out
in
the
rico
cases
statement,
now
has
no
standing,
neither
of
these
clinics
have
standing.
and
it
is
not
only
appropriate,
but
it's
a
duty
on
us,
as
an
advocate
of
this
court,
to
draw
that
lack
of
standing
to
this
court's
attention.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes.
let
me
answer
the
first
part
of
your
question.
the
grant
of
cert...
contrary
to
ms.
clayton's
position
is
we
did
not
seek
a
grant
of
cert.
what
we
merely
pointed
out
in
our
brief
was
that
if
this
court
took
the
rico
question,
it
would
face
necessarily
the
question
of
extortion.
and
since
we
are
respondents
and
not
petitioners,
we
may
defend
the
court
below,
the
judgment
of
the
court
below,
on
any
ground
whether
it
was
raised
below
or
not,
and
in
this
case
it
was.
our
central
and
strongest
argument
is
"no
extortion".
and
there
is
no
extortion
in
this
case
for
two
fundamental
reasons.
this
statute,
the
hobbs
act,
was
modeled
on
new
york
law.
new
york
law
was
modeled
on
the
common
law.
in
1865,
the
field
code
commentary
carefully
explained
that
the
extortion
provisions
of
that
code
was
part
of
the
property
loss
series:
embezzlement,
larceny,
robbery
and
extortion.
each
requires
a
common
law
taking,
a
trespatory
taking.
what
is
happening
in
this
case
is
they
are
transposing
a
clear
common
law
term,
extortion,
and
making
it
into
a
modern
statutory
term,
coercion.
and
they're
doing
that
by
taking
the
concept
"property",
which
starts
out
to
mean
tangible
property.
you
can
interpret
it
to
be
intangible
property.
you
can
interpret
it
to
be
intangible
rights.
and
finally,
the
right
is
not
obtained
but
the
other
is
deprived
of
it.
that
particular
process
of
interpretation
is
not
reading
a
statute,
it
is
redrafting
it.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
your
honor,
it
is
correct
to
say
that
the
lower
court
dismissed
this
under
rule
12.
but
the
lower
court
relied
on
materials
outside
of
the
pleading,
to
wit,
in
the
rico
cases
statement.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
if
you
confine
yourself
to
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
there's
not
one
word
about
arson,
kidnapping,
murder,
terrorism,
or
any
of
the
violent
acts
being
alleged
here.
the
underlying
facts
in
this
case
are
no
more
than,
no
less
than--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor,
the
rico
cases
statement
that
was
filed
was
filed
after
two
motions
were
made.
one
was
a
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement
under
rule
12.
that
function
would
be,
really,
to
explain
what
was
already
in
the
complaint.
you
can't
amend
a
complaint
by
filing
an
answer
under
rule
12.
it
was
also
filed
in
response
to
a
motion
under
rule
16,
as
to
control
the
docket,
and
the
function
of
the
rico
cases
statement
here
is
an
admission
by
a
party
opponent.
and
this
judge
asked,
in
february
these
plaintiffs,
tell
me
your
facts
consistent
with
rule
11
that
you
rely
on.
tell
me
the
statutes
that
you
rely
on.
they
answered
that
in
the
court
below,
and
the
only
answer
they
gave
was
the
hobbs
act.
we
didn't
hear
one
word
about
murder.
that's
outside
the
record.
about
terrorism,
which
happens
not
to
be
a
predicate
offense...
we
didn't
hear
anything
about
bombing.
all
we
heard
was
these
acts
violate
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
not
state
extortion,
not
coercion,
but
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
your
honor,
this
is
after
almost
5
years
of
discovery.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
whether
or
not
they
could
amend
is
not
in
front
of
this
court,
because
they
never
made
a
motion
to
amend
below.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
let
me
turn,
your
honor,
if
i
might,
to
the
economic
motive.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
this
statute
can
be
summed
up
in
two
words,
illicit
gain.
the
concept
of
illicit
gain
pervades
the
statute,
the
title,
the
findings,
the
definitions,
the
operative
language
in
the
statute,
the
criminal
remedies,
the
civil
remedies,
statutes
with
which
it
is
in
pari
materia,
and
the
legislative
history.
the
precise
words
used
in
each
section
varies
with
the
purpose
of
each
section,
but
this
statute
can
be
summed
up
in
two
words,
illicit
gain.
look
at
the
title.
this
is
the
label
on
the
bottle.
it
says
racketeering
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations.
racketeer
means
extortion
and
fraud.
corrupt
means
venal.
there
right
in
the
label
of
the
bottle
is
the
commercial
notion
of
gain.
look
at
the
findings.
there
are
five
findings
in
this
statute:
the
last
deals
with
legal
defects;
the
first
two
deal
with
obtaining
and
utilizing
illicit
gain;
the
second
two
deal
with
the
effects
of
it
when
you
invest
and
weaken.
look
at
the
definitions
in
the
statute.
the
word
"person"
describes
the
class
who
can
sue
and
be
sued,
or
be
indicted.
it
is,
by
the
definition
of
the
statute,
limited
to
people
who
can
hold
a
beneficial
interest
in
property.
look
at
the
concept
of
enterprise
as
it's
found
in
the
statute.
enterprise
is
illustrated
in
the
statute,
not
defined.
it
is
appropriate
therefore
to
look
to
its
common
everyday
meaning.
its
common
everyday
meaning
is
precisely
that
of
a
business
venture.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
my
point
here
is
precisely
that
of
justice
cardozo
in
american
knife.
to
interpret
this
statute
and
understand
it,
let's
take
a
look
at
its
average
case,
not
the
exceptional
case.
the
average
case
within
the
statute
is
going
to
be
a
commercial
enterprise
engaging
in
commercial
activity.
there
are
penumbra
issues
such
as
a
government,
and...
which
is
clearly
within
the
statute,
and
was
recognized
by
judge
kaufman
in
anginelli,
in
the
course
of
the
ivic
opinion.
nothing
that
we
say
here
today
should
be
understood
to
suggest
that
governments
cannot
be
enterprises,
but
only
when
they
engage
in
or
they
are
utilized
to
engage
in
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
that
has
a
commercial
dimension.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
no,
no.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
sheerly
that
to
respond
to
the
government.
let
me
go
through
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
opportunity--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--well,
what
i
think
you
have
to
meet,
your
honor,
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
what...
the
phrase
commercial
dimension
is
something
that
pervades
the
statute
as
a
whole.
you
have
to
go...
for
example,
to
recover
damages
in
this
case,
you
must
show
injury
to
business
or
property.
the
commercial
dimension
is
the
injury
to
business
or
property.
in
the
example
of
the
criminal
sanctions,
the
characteristic
criminal
sanction
of
this
statute
is
a
forfeiture.
if
you
take
the
profit
out
of
crime,
you
presuppose
a
profit-making
crime.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
it's
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
which
means
you
must
sit
it
in
the
text
as
drafted.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
and
what
we
would
do--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--what
we
would
do
in...
and
let's
turn
right
to
section
1962(c).
section
1962
says:
"any
person
employed
by
or
associated
with
an
enterprise
that
conducts
that
enterprise's
affairs
by
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
"
wherein
lies
the
commercial
dimension?
the
commercial
dimension
in
that
provision
lies
in
the
word
"affairs".
affairs
means
commercial
or
professional
business,
as
a
matter
of
plain
meaning.
the
set--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor,
let
me
explain
it
this
way.
we
deal
here
with
the
set.
the
set
is
activity.
the
subset
is
racketeering
activity.
the
sub-subset
is
racketeering
activity
in
affairs.
it
is
quite
possible
to
have
a
noncommercial
enterprise
that
engages
in
noncommercial
racketeering
activity,
but
not
in
its
affairs.
the
affairs
is
the
word
of
limitation
that
confines
1962--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--yes,
yes.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
a
benevolent
association.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
a
benevolent
association
may
very
well
have
a
large
pension
fund
and
the
mob
wants
to
take
it
over.
that's
an
enterprise.
but
the
reason
they
want
to
take
it
over
and
the
way
they
must
take
it
over
to
fall
within
rico
is
by
engaging
in,
for
example,
extortion.
and
extortion
is
a
property-obtaining
notion.
it's
not
coercion,
which
is
conduct-forcing
notion.
and
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
when
you
see
the
word
(a),
(b),
and
(c),
there
ought
not
be
any
doubt--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--no.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
no.
no,
your
honor,
wisdom
comes
so
late
in
the
affairs
of
man.
[laughter]
that
we'll
not
turn
it
down
simply
because
it--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--well,
if
you...
a
careful
reading
of
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
is
that
it
adopted
the
ivic-bagaric-ferguson
line
of
opinions.
and
what
happened
from
ivic
to
bagaric
to
ferguson,
the
use
of
the
word
motivation
was
thought,
in
retrospect,
to
be
inappropriate
because
it
might
deal
with
subjective
motive.
therefore
the
test
changed
from
ivic
to
bagaric
and
became
an
objective
characterization.
and
then
the
question
of
degree
came
up,
which
the
government
has
raised.
in
ferguson
it
was
clarified
to
be
any.
it's
not
a
question
of
degree,
it's
a
question
of
kind.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes.
and
the
cases
are
clear.
precisely
in
bagaric
it
was
the
same
basic
terrorist
group
that
was
involved
in
ivic,
but
in
bagaric
they
were
only...
in
ivic
they
were
only
engaging
in
homicides.
in
bagaric
they
were
engaging
in
classic
extortion,
it
was
property
obtaining.
this
statute
has
been
successfully
applied
to
terrorist
groups
where
they
engage
in
commercial
activity,
for
example
to
raise
money.
the
order,
an
antisemitic
group
in
the
west
that
went
around...
you
may
recall,
killed
alan
berg
simply
because
he
was
a
jew.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
the
word
i
would
prefer--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor,
i'm
kind
of
stuck
with
the
language
in
the
cases.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
two
words
that
summarize
the
statute
is
illicit
gain.
in
fact,
when
you
find
out
the
sense
in
which
they're
using
commercial
motivation
or
mercenary
purpose
or
financial
purpose,
what
they,
in
fact,
in
the
cases
have
said
meets
it
is
some
kind
of
a
gain,
a
robbery
that
produces
money.
for
example,
in
the
order
case,
they
were
robbing
banks
and
they
were
prosecuted
for
robbing
banks--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor,
i
would
prefer
not
to
give
up
anything.
[laughter]
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you,
if
i
may
borrow
the
language
of
this
court,
is
the
interpretation
of
this
statute
is
a
holistic
endeavor.
we've
got
to
look
at
the
entire
text,
the
punctuation,
the
words,
the
structure.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
no.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
no.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--well,
there
are
two
answers
to
it.
in
this
case
that
argument
was
made.
to
show
in
this
case
economic
motive,
you
can
do
it
either
in
the
predicate
acts
or
in
the
enterprise.
the
predicate
act
extortion
requires
the
money
to
be
obtained
from
the
victim.
now
the
question
is
if
the
money
was
obtained
merely
by
donations
from
third
parties,
this
is
a
situation
where
precisely
in
this
record
it
was
held,
or
it
was
found
that
there's
no
proximate
cause
relationship
between
third-party
donations
and--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--as
you
move
in
that--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--as
you
move
in
that
direction...
and
the
question
is
how
far
you
take
me.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
you
will
make
those
third
party
donors
coconspirators
and
aid-and-abettors.
they're
the
people
who,
in
effect,
are
hiring
this
crime
to
be
done.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
it's
quite
possible
to
ratify
a
crime.
it's
certainly
possible
to
join
the
conspiracy
afterwards.
let
me
take
two
items
in
addition
to
those
in
the
text.
i
think
this
is
a
text-based
argument.
it
rises
from
a
holistic
view
of
the
statute,
of
the
actual
language
employed
in
each
section.
let's
look
and
see
whether
this
is
confirmed...
not
independently
established,
but
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history.
put
yourself
back
in
1970.
the
issue
that
burned
in
this
country
then
was
not
abortion,
not
animal
rights,
not
fossil
fuels,
not
fur
and
the
fur
industry,
but
the
war
in
vietnam.
this
statute
was
proposed
and
it
was
objected
to
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
specifically
on
the
grounds
that
the
definition
of
racketeering
activity
was
so
wide
open
it
might
apply
to
the
takeover
of
the
pentagon
and
to
the
takeover
of
the
university
at
columbia.
congress
immediately
turned
to
narrow
that
definition,
with
a
specific
intent
of
avoiding
the
application
of
rico
to
demonstrations.
not
abortion
demonstrations:
what
they
had
in
mind
was
the
war
in
vietnam.
and
they
selected...
this
is
now
the
problem
of
set
and
subset
again.
the
set
for
this
are
all
state
and
federal
crimes.
they
didn't
put
them
all
in,
they
selected
them.
and
what
was
the
principle
of
selection?
and
this
can
be
determined
by
looking
at
the
statutes,
not
the
legislative
history.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
the
change
was
not
to
the
definition
of
enterprise.
but,
your
honor,
enterprise
sits
in
a
context,
and
if
you
don't
have
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
what
good
does
it
do
to
have
an
enterprise.
and
what
we're
looking
at
now
is
what
congress'
intention
was
in
1970.
they
modified
the
definition
of
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
specifically
to
avoid
the
application
of
this
statute
to
the
demonstrations
on
the
war
in
vietnam.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
they
took
the
definition
of
racketeering
activity,
which
included
any
crime
dangerous
to
life,
limb,
or
property...
dangerous
to
life,
limb,
or
property,
which
clearly
would
have
fit
this
facts,
and
they
moved
it
down
to
specific
crimes.
and
the
specific
crimes
that
they
adopted
was
extortion,
not
coercion.
in
1961
this
country
had
promulgated
in
the
criminal
law
community
the
model
penal
code.
anyone
familiar
with
the
vocabulary
of
the
model
penal
code...
and
mclellan,
hruska,
and
paff,
the
principal
architects
of
this
statute
were
familiar
with
the
model
penal
code;
they
served
on
the
brown
commission...
knew
the
difference
between
extortion
and
coercion.
when
they
put
in
extortion
and
leave
out
coercion--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor,
this
is
holistically.
you
have
to
look
at
every
word
in
context.
i
am--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--if...
when
you
read
the
legislative
history
closely,
you
see
that
the
addition
of
some
offenses...
murder
would
be
one,
obstruction
of
justice
would
be
another...
was
added
for
the
instrumental
role...
not
the
direct
role,
but
the
instrumental
role...
role
they
play
in
economic
affairs,
not
independent.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
your
honor,
absolutely.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
you
cannot
do
this
word
by
word.
you've
got
to
do
it
line
by
line,
text
by
text.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
your
honor,
i
think
the...
the
limitation
comes
from
the
word
(c).
it
comes
from
(b).
it
comes
from
(a).
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
your
honor.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
your
honor,
this
statute
was--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor,
i
want
to
rely
on
all
the
arguments--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--and
let
me...
let
me
turn
to
another
one.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
obscenity
was
not
in
it,
your
honor,
in
1970.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
it's
in
it
now,
and
maybe
congress
was
unwise
in
doing
that.
[laughter]
let
me
turn
to...
but
we're
not
here
to
argue
that,
fortunately.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
your
honor,
i
think
whatever
1970,
it
remains
that
no
matter
what
they
do
when
they
introduce
obscenity.
let
me
turn...
in
other
words,
if
obscenity
comes
in
it
doesn't
change
the
meaning
of
the
word
"affairs".
affairs
means
commercial
or
professional
business,
and
it's
the
word
of
limitation
in
this
context.
let
me
turn,
if
i
might,
to
the
statutes
in
pari
materia
with
this
statute.
this
statute
was
modeled
on
the
antitrust
statutes.
the
antitrust
statutes
have
as
their
purpose
securing
freedom
in
the
marketplace.
rico
has
as
its
purpose
securing
integrity
in
the
marketplace.
when
congress
adopted
rico
in
1970,
it
had
before
it
the
subtle
jurisprudence
of
this
court
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
that
subtle
jurisprudence
excludes
political
activity,
it
excludes
labor
activity,
it...
and
we've
learned
since,
in
claiborne
hardware,
that
it
excludes
protest
activity.
if,
in
fact,
carrie
nation
and
the
anti-saloon
league
wielding
an
ax
in
a
saloon
is
not
in
restraint
of
trade,
if
william
letter
heading
up
the
american
association...
american
federation
of
hosiery
workers
in
a
violent
sitdown
strike
is
not
restraint
of
trade,
if
medgar
evers
and
the
naacp
in
a
sometimes
violent
civil
rights
boycott
is
not
in
restraint
of
trade,
then
i
suggest
to
you
joe
scheidler
and
plan
is
not
conducting
the
affairs
in
the
sense
of
business
or
commercial.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
that's
why,
your
honor--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor,
let
me
trace
the
legislative
history
at
this
point.
an
earlier
statute
indeed
used
the
word
"business"
and
the
reason
the
word
"business"
was
dropped
is
because
two
statutes
were
merged.
senator
mclellan's
original
syndicate
bill,
which
was
aimed
at
the
underworld
generally,
senator
hruska's
infiltration
bills
were
aimed
at
the
upper
world.
senator
hruska's
bill
said
"business
enterprise".
when
those
two
bills
were
merged,
had
the
statutory
draftsman
left
the
word
"business"
in
there,
you
would
have
had
the
very
real
ambiguity
this
court
had
to
deal
with
in
turkette
as
to
whether
this
meant
legitimate
business
only.
the
word
"business"
was
dropped
not
to
make
it
beyond
business--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor--
[laughter]
you
certainly
do.
the
question
is
whether
you
have
them
in
this
statute
in
this
context.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
holistic
and
cannot
be
done
by
the
abstract
analysis
of
the
word
"affairs".
look
at
it
in
context.
