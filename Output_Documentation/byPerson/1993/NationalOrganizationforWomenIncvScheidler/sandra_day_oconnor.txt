blakey,
i
thought
we
had
a
case
before
us
that
comes
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
i
mean
that's
what
happened
below,
pleadings
and
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
i
thought
that
the
petitioners...
certainly
mr.
estrada,
as
amicus,
said
that
there
are
other
allegations
of
predicate
acts
other
than
extortion
in
the
pleadings
that
would
be
sufficient
to
withstand
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
i
assume
all
these
things
can
be
addressed
in
the
courts
below
if
it
gets
back,
if
it
survives
the
motion
to
dismiss.
i
don't
understand
why
we're
really
addressing
that
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
do
we
have
to
do
that?
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
do
more
than
look
at
the
pleadings
and
are
petitioners
correct
that
in
those
pleadings,
at
least,
that
there
are
allegations
of
arson
and
kidnapping
and
one
thing
and
another,
that
fall
within
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yeah.
