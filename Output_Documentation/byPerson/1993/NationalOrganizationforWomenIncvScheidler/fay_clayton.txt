ms.
fay
clayton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
ms.
fay
clayton
--yes,
your
honor.
i
represent
the
national
organization
for
women
in
its
capacity
as
a
representative
of
its
female
members
who
might
use
the
clinic
service...
the
clinic
services,
and
not
in
it's
own
capacity
on
the
rico
claim.
we
did
have
now
in
its
individual
capacity
on
the
antitrust,
which
may
have
given
some
confusion.
of
course,
in
addition
i
also
represent
the
clinics,
delaware
women's
health
center
and
summit,
who
have
standing
in
their
own
right
and
who
also
represent
a
class
of
all
similarly
situated
clinics.
ms.
fay
clayton
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
it's
seeking
to
protect
the
rights
of
its
women
members.
and
in
particular
it's
just
seeking
the
injunctive
relief,
it's
not
seeking
damages
for
those
women.
the
clinics,
of
course,
are
seeking
damages
for
themselves
and
all
similarly
situated
clinics.
your
honors,
this
case
involves
forcible
violent
conduct
by
a
highly
structured
enterprise
called
plan,
an
enterprise
with
a
very
clearly
defined
goal,
to
force
every
women's
health
center
that
offers
abortion
out
of
business
by
whatever
means
are
necessary,
including
terrorist
tactics.
our
case
arises
under
rico,
which
doesn't
say
a
word
about
economic
motive,
and
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
to
apply
the
statute
that
congress
wrote
or
amend
it
judicially
to
add
this
unstated
requirement.
i'd
like
to
discuss
three
points
this
morning.
first,
that
the
text
and
structure
of
rico
do
not
allow
for
an
economic
motive
requirement.
second,
that
to
apply
the
statute
as
congress
wrote
it
easily
comports
with
the
first
amendment.
and
third,
that
an
economic
motive
requirement
would
be
bad
policy
in
any
event.
starting
with
the
text,
we
bring
our
case
under
section
1962(c)
of
rico,
which
doesn't
mention
economic
motive,
and
neither
do
the
two
terms
where
the
lower
court
claimed
to
find
this
requirement.
both
"racketeering
activity"
and
"enterprise"
are
terms
that
congress
expressly
defined.
they're
terms
that
this
court
has
called
broad.
and
in
the
sedima
case,
this
court
pointed
out
that
"racketeering
activity"
consists
of
the
commission
of
the
predicate
acts,
no
more
and
no
less.
and
in
h.j.
the
court
recognized
that
this
generous
definition
would
purposefully
attract
a
broad
array
of
perpetrators.
we
know
that
congress
did
not
want
to
limit
racketeering
activity
to
only
those
crimes
that
were
economically
motivated,
because
when
congress
chose
the
30-some-odd
crimes
to
include
in
rico
as
the
predicate
acts,
it
included
numerous
crimes
that
have
no
necessary
relation
to
money
at
all.
in
fact,
three
of
the
first
four,
arson,
kidnap,
and
murder,
have
no
necessary
relation
to
money.
and
none
of
the
predicate
acts
is
any
less
a
crime
if
it's
committed
for
some
other
reason
like
power,
hatred,
or
revenge.
ms.
fay
clayton
your
honor,
it
sometimes
is
and
it
sometimes
isn't.
the
news
the
other
night
indicated
there's
a
new
theory
about
the
lindbergh
kidnapping,
and
it's
my
suggestion
that
if
it
turns
out
that
it
was
a
relative
who
did
it
because
of
a
spurned
love
affair,
that
would
be
just
as
much
kidnapping
as
if
it
were
mr.
hauptmann
who
had
done
it
for
the
ransom.
the
fact
is
that
kidnapping
doesn't
require
money.
that's
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
it
sometimes
includes
it,
it
sometimes
doesn't.
sometimes
even
organized
crime,
in
terms
of
mobsters,
kidnap
people
to
protect
their
turf
or
to
avenge
an
insult,
or
for
some
other
reason.
ms.
fay
clayton
well,
your
honor,
that
is
the
alternate
source
that
the
lower
court--
ms.
fay
clayton
--it
certainly
does,
your
honor.
ms.
fay
clayton
well,
as
used
in
the
enterprise
zones
that
we
have
in
chicago,
they
relate
to
commercial
businesses.
but
congress
defined
the
term--
ms.
fay
clayton
--enterprise
has
many
definitions,
including
that,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
ms.
fay
clayton
unquestionably.
but
congress
defined
the
term
"enterprise".
it
didn't
leave
it
to
our
imagination.
it
didn't
even
leave
it
to
dictionary
definitions.
ms.
fay
clayton
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
fay
clayton
and
as
this
court
said
in
turkette,
that
word
"includes"
means
that
there
are
no
restrictions
on
the
word
"enterprise".
it
includes
any
association,
in
fact.
ms.
fay
clayton
we'd
have
a
very
different
situation
then,
your
honor.
ms.
fay
clayton
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
if
congress
had
defined
the
term
that
way,
that
would
have
been
an
ambiguous
definition.
we
know
that
in
a
predecessor--
ms.
fay
clayton
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
ms.
fay
clayton
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
business
enterprise
seems
a
little
inconsistent
with
associations,
in
fact
which,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
is
an
unambiguous
term.
the
court
has
said
that.
the
predecessor
draft
of
rico
did
use...
one
of
the
predecessor
drafts,
in
fact
three
of
them
used
the
term
"business
enterprise".
not
as
part
of
a
definition,
i
think
that
would
have
been
confusing;
they
used
it
as
part
of
the
statutory
text.
if
1962(c)
said
business
enterprise,
we
couldn't
be
here,
there's
no
question.
but
that
particular
language
was
dropped
by
congress.
it
was
dropped
from
senate
bill
1623.
it
was
dropped
from
senate
bill
2048
and
2049.
and
the
version
that
congress
enacted,
your
honor,
doesn't
have
"business"
in
it.
ms.
fay
clayton
your
honor,
i
do
not
concede
that
business
means...
that
enterprise
means
business.
it
includes
business
enterprises,
it
includes
nonbusiness
enterprises.
in
fact,
the
argument
that
your
honor
is
articulating
is
so
much
like
the
one
that
this
court
rejected
in
turkette,
where
it
refused
to
limit
rico's
enterprises
to
legitimate
enterprises.
the
argument
was
meant...
the
argument
was
made
that
the
enterprise
definition
meant
only
legitimate
enterprises,
but
this
court
said
if
congress
had
wanted
to
limit
the
statute
to
only
legitimate
enterprises,
it
could
have
used
the
word.
here
not
only
did
congress
not
include
the
word
"business
enterprise"
in
either
the
statute
itself
or
the
definition,
justice
scalia,
it
actually
dropped
that
term.
and
that
shows,
one,
that
congress
knows
how
to
use
the
words
when
it
wants
to
limit
a
statute.
and,
two,
it
made
the
decision
not
to
do
that.
ms.
fay
clayton
well,
your
honor,
congress
didn't
say--
ms.
fay
clayton
--we
did,
your
honor,
and
we--
ms.
fay
clayton
--they
certainly
don't.
and
it's
absolutely--
ms.
fay
clayton
--your--
ms.
fay
clayton
--your
honor,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
but
not
because
of
the
definition
of
what
antitrust
covers,
but
because
of
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
doesn't
let
the
antitrust
laws
or
any
laws
cover
protected
speech
like
a
boycott,
like
a
nonviolent
boycott.
ms.
fay
clayton
your
honor,
the
antitrust
laws
are
crystal
clear
that
nonprofit
organizations
are
covered.
this
court
said
that
in
d.c.
lawyers,
it
said
it
in
professional
engineers,
and
it
said
it
from
time
immemorial.
the
antitrust
laws
are
clearly
applicable
to
nonprofit
organizations.
ms.
fay
clayton
they
do,
your
honor.
and
you
know
something,
it's
very
important,
justice
stevens,
to
remember
that
rico
does
have
one
business
requirement.
it
requires
effects
on
business
or
property.
it
requires
in
section
1964(c)
that
for
a
plaintiff
to
come
before
this
court
in
a
private
case
it
must
have
been
injured
in
its
business
or
property.
congress
spelled
that
out
right
in
the
statute,
unlike
this
missing
motive
requirement
which
doesn't
appear
anywhere.
and
by
the
way,
justice
stevens,
that
economic
effect
is
something
that
even
the
lower
court
recognized
we
unquestionably
have,
because
this
nationwide
campaign
of
terror
has
caused
and
continues
to
cause
enormous
business
and
property
damages
to
our
plaintiffs.
another
reason
that
we
should
not
infer
an
economic
motive
requirement
into
a
statute
that
is
totally
devoid
of
one
is
rico's
liberal
construction
clause.
this
clause
shows
that
congress
purposefully
chose
breadth
over
narrow
constructions.
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
russello,
this
is
an
unusual
provision,
particularly
for
a
criminal
statute,
and
it
shows
congress'
choice
to
be
expansive,
particularly
in
the
remedial
provisions
of
rico's
application.
i
would
like
to
address
the
first
amendment
issue.
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
antitrust
laws
certainly
brought
that
into
play.
and
the
respondents
have
argued
here
that
their
conduct
is
really
speech,
but
both
of
the
lower
courts
recognized
how
false
that
claim
was.
plan,
as
we've
pled
in
our
complaint,
is
dedicated,
committed
to
mob
violence,
to
the
use
of
any
and
all
means
necessary
to
force
the
clinics
and
patients
to
give
up
their
protected
rights.
plan
ridicules
peace-loving
opponents
of
abortion.
it
calls
them
wimps.
plan
says
it
will
only
answer
to
higher
laws,
which
are
articulated
by
the
leaders
of
plan.
it
will
not--
ms.
fay
clayton
--that's
correct.
ms.
fay
clayton
well--
ms.
fay
clayton
--that's
right,
your
honor,
on
the
first
point
at
least.
ms.
fay
clayton
one
does
not
have
to
get
property.
one
has
to
obtain
property,
which
has
been
interpreted
by
the
courts,
meaning
to
make
someone
give
up
property.
in
green
this
court
said
the
emphasis
is
on
what
the
victim
loses.
ms.
fay
clayton
not
always,
your
honor.
when
somebody
extorts--
ms.
fay
clayton
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
there
actually
is
some
gain,
because
in
many
cases
the
clinics
run
by
plan
and
its
coconspirators
actually
get
the
business
opportunities
in
the
form
of
patients
who
they
take
to
the...
the
antichoice
clinics.
ms.
fay
clayton
it's
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
your
honor.
and
in
that
example,
that
conduct
is
not
extortion
because
first
amendment
protected
speech
can
never
be
extortion.
if
those
same
boycott...
if
those
same
protesters
took
their
picket
signs
and
hit
the...
their...
the
grocery
store
on
the
head
or
forcibly
blockaded
the
store
so
they
could
not
do
business
and
thus
deprived
them
of
their
property
right,
then
we
would
have
extortion.
but
peaceful
picketing
can
never
be
extortion.
it
can
never
be
a
predicate
act
of
any
sort
under
rico.
ms.
fay
clayton
thank
you,
justice
ginsburg.
no,
we
do
not.
that
was
offered
as
a
question
for
review
by
the
respondents,
but
the
court
did
not
see
fit
to
take
that
issue.
and,
in
fact,
your
honor,
even
if
the
court
were
to
totally
disregarded
hobbs
act
extortion,
we
have
so
many
other
predicate
acts
that
arise
under
federal
pleading
standards,
that
arise
from
the
very
same
allegations
of
the
complaint...
i
mean
there's
travel
act
violations,
state
law
extortion,
section
659,
arson,
kidnap,
a
lot
of
others.
so
even
if
we
totally
put
aside
the
hobbs
act
extortion
issue,
we
have
far
more
than
the
two
required
predicate
acts.
ms.
fay
clayton
your
honor,
of
course
it
doesn't.
we
treasure
the
defendants'
first
amendment
rights
like
we
treasure
our
own,
and
we
do
not
want
to
in
any
way
infringe
on
those
rights.
we
have
tried
in
the
discovery
and
the
district
court...
and
as
the
district
court
recognized,
we've
drawn
such
a
wide
margin
around
protected
speech.
when
they
picket,
when
they
pray,
when
they
leaflet,
when
they
petition
congress,
this
is
protected,
this
can
never
be
extortion,
it
can
never
be
a
predicate
act.
but
when
they
give
up
that
protected
form
of
speech
and
they
turn
to
force
and
violence
and
the
use
of
fear
of
more
force
and
violence,
particularly
in
a
context
where
we
have
arson,
we
have
killings,
we
have
threatened
killings,
that...
once
and
a
while
their
advocacy
can
cross
the
line,
as
this
court
explained
in
claiborne
hardware
and
in
meadowmore,
it
can
cross
the
line--
ms.
fay
clayton
--they're
not,
your
honor.
they're
not.
ms.
fay
clayton
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
those
are
the
precise
issues.
and
as
i...
i
believe
i've
explained,
the
statute
and
the
structure
of
rico
do
not
allow
for
it.
looking
at
the
structure,
we
see
the
organized
crime
control
act
does
have
some
business
enterprise
limitations,
rico
does
not.
there
are
a
host
of
policy
reasons
also
for
not
inferring
an
economic
motive.
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
fay
clayton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
heard
mr.
blakey
right,
his
argument
began
with
the
principle
that
the
concept
of
illicit
gain
sums
up
the
rico
statute.
i
think
in...
justice
ginsburg's
question
just
a
moment
ago
pointed
out
how
inaccurate
that
statement
really
is.
but
i
would
also
like
to
remind
the
court
and
mr.
blakey
that
in
his
1980
article
which
is
relied
upon
by
mr.
scheidler
in
his
brief,
he
said...
and
more
important,
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasion
that
congress
knew
how
to
put
a
limitation
in
rico
when
it
wanted
to.
and
if
congress
wanted
to
limit
rico
to
crimes
done
for
illicit
gain,
two
words
would
have
solved
the
problem
and
we
wouldn't
see
the
quagmire
of
issues
like
mr.
blakey
has
been
forced
to
address
this
morning.
the
question...
the
argument
that
he
makes
raises
so
many
questions
that
no
one
can
answer.
even
the
lower
courts
couldn't
say...
with
all
the
various
definitions
they've
come
up
with
in
ivic,
in
bagaric,
which
took
away
motive
and
gave
dimension,
it
still
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
where
we're
supposed
to
look
for
this
economic
motive
or
dimension
or
gain.
is
it
supposed
to
be
in
the
crimes,
in
the
enterprise,
in
the
criminals
themselves?
congress
knew
how
to
put
limits
in
rico,
and
as
this
court
said
in
russello,
the
short
answer
is
that
congress
did
not
write
the
statute
that
way.
it
could
have...
certainly
it
could
have
limited
enterprises
to
business
enterprises.
it
could
have
limited
predicate
acts
to
ones
done
for
gain:
murder
for
profit,
arson
for
profit.
it
didn't
do
that.
affairs
certainly
doesn't
imply
the
exclusion
of
illegitimate
affairs
any
more...
or
noneconomic
affairs
any
more
than
the
arguments
that
this
court
heard
in
turkette
made
any
sense.
it
just
doesn't
wash.
mr.
blakey's
reliance
on
the
antitrust
laws
is
mystifying
to
me,
because
the
antitrust
laws
for
more
than
three-quarters
of
a
century
have
taught
that
good
motives
do
not
save
illegal
acts.
and
all
the
authorities,
his
reference
to
antitrust
cases,
are
entirely
apart
from
this
case,
because
each
and
every
one
of
them
involved
either
petitioning
or
protected
lawful
speech.
even
the
seventh
circuit,
which
threw
out...
which
upheld
throwing
out
our
complaint,
recognized--
ms.
fay
clayton
--but,
your
honor,
it
was
based
on
the
text,
the
phrase
"restraint
of
trade".
restraint
of
trade
was
not
a
defined
term
in
the
antitrust--
ms.
fay
clayton
--your
honor,
going
back
almost
a
century,
we
know
that
when
the
antitrust
laws
were
enacted,
the
word
"restraint
of
trade"
was
a
highly
technical,
highly
legalistic
term,
and
the
court
had
to
infer
what
it
meant.
ms.
fay
clayton
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter,
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
ms.
fay
clayton
it
would...
it
would
seem
like
that
would
be
the
limitation,
but
he--
ms.
fay
clayton
--well,
your
honor,
the
antitrust
laws
don't
exclude
nonprofit
enterprises.
i
mean...
or
nonprofit
businesses.
we
have
the...
all
the
professional,
the
lawyers
that
we
had,
the
medical
association,
the
people
who
were
the
association
saying
plastic
tube
was
dangerous,
all
these
nonprofit
associations,
they
were
not--
ms.
fay
clayton
--not
always,
your
honor.
in
many
cases
the...
in
fact,
there's
never
been
a
case,
your
honor,
where
the
antitrust
law
has
been
limited...
except
this
case,
where
the
lower
court...
we
had
wished
you
had
taken
our
antitrust
issue
too.
but
the
lower
court
was
the
first
one
in
the
country
to
ever
say
motives
count.
the
eighth
circuit
decision
in
council
of
defense
had
said
exactly
the
opposite.
a
purely
political
boycott
there,
and
a
peaceable
one
so
we
didn't
invoke
the
first
amendment
problems...
that
the
eighth
circuit
said
in
1920
and
that
had
been
good
law
ever
since,
that
the
fact
that
they
did
it
purely
for
politics,
they
didn't
like
mr.
hearst's
pro-german
sympathy
and
so
they
called
for
a
major
commercial
boycott,
not
a
consumer
boycott,
of
his
paper,
that
wasn't
protected.
this
is
the
first
case
that's
ever--
ms.
fay
clayton
--absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
right
and
i
think
to
impose
a
requirement
on
the
antitrust
laws
that
if...
that
if
they're
done
for
another
motive,
it
flies
in
the
face
of
all
of
the
antitrust
case
law
which
shows
that
purpose
and
effect
on
commerce
is
what
counts.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
