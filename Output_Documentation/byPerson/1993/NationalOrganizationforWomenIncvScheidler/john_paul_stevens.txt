justice
john
paul
stevens
just...
but
justice
scalia
just
did.
what
do
you
say
about
the
word
"enterprise"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
blakey.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
blakey,
just
looking
briefly
at
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
ground
of
decision
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
lack
of
an
economic
motive,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that's
correct,
you
win
and
there'd
be
no
leave
to
amend
and
the
ballgame
is
entirely
over.
but
if
there
is
a
dispute
about
fringe
facts,
i
would
suppose
the
district
judge
would
let
them
amend
and
add
these
additional
things
that
might
not
be
a
complete
termination
of
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
judgment
for
the
district
court.
yes,
but
on
the
specific
ground
that
we've
granted
certiorari
to
decide,
that's...
both
lower
courts
decided
that
issue,
and
it's
a
very
important
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because,
they
were...
they
lost
on
the
ground
of
no
economic
motive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wish
you
would,
because
that's
what
we
really
granted
cert
to
do...
to
consider.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
a
minute,
professor
blakey,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
has
the
word
"affairs"
been
relied
on
in
the
opinions
adopting
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
debateable.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn't
respond
to
the
question
justice
scalia
has
raised
too.
that's
a
concern,
is
that
the
seventh
circuit's
original
position
seemed
rather
clear,
but
the
second
circuit
seemed
over
the
years
to
have
somewhat
withdrawn
from
the
economic
test.
and
it's
kind
of
hard
to
know
exactly
what
the
test
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the...
one
of
the
cases
that
troubles
me
if
you're
trying
to
think
through
this
thing,
say
you've
got
a
terrorist
organization...
because
we're
not
just
dealing
with
the
abortion
situation,
but
terrorism
and
other
things.
and
say
that
their
ultimate
motive
is...
the
purpose
of
the
crusade,
whatever
it
is,
but
they're
doing
these
activities
to
get
some
money
to
help
finance
purchasing
guns
that
the
ira
needs
and
that
sort
of
thing.
would
the
mixed
motive
qualify
for...
under
your
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
a
series
of
very
dramatic
illegal
acts
in
support
of
a
cause
generate
large
contributions
to
the
cause
from
third
parties,
would
that
provide
the
economic
requirement
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
they're
publicized
and
deliberately
done
for
that
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
it
be?
because
it's
indirect
or
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
the
facts
of
this
case
are
strong
enough,
but
i
was
thinking
of
the
hypothetical
where
they
said
we
are
going
to
burn
down
a
church,
or
something,
to
demonstrate
our
strong
feelings
about
this,
and
we
hope
everybody
who
reads
about
it
will
send
in
100
to
such
and
such
an
address.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
qualify--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
they
send
the
money
in
after
the
fact
only?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
this
argument,
though,
you
suggest
that
in
response
to
the
concern
about
the
vietnam
protestors
they
drew
up...
drafted
a
rather
narrow
definition
of
racketeering
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
narrowed
definition
includes
over
2
pages
and
lists
lots
of
crimes,
some
of
which
do
not
have
an
economic
motive
such
as
some
of
the
obscenity
crimes.
so
i
don't
know
how
that
helps
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
in
it
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
think
it's
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
they
limit
it
in
a
way
which
definitely
excluded
everything
except
economic
gain.
