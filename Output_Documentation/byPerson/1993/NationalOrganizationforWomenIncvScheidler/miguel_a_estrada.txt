mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
three
reasons,
rico
does
not
require
a
prosecutor
or
a
plaintiff
to
prove
an
economic
motive.
first,
there
is
no
textual
basis
for
such
a
requirement.
second,
this
court
has
already
rejected
similar
nontextual
limitations
on
the
scope
of
rico
which
were
also
claimed
to
derive
from
congress'
purpose
in
passing
the
statute.
and
third,
the
economic
motive
requirement
is
elusive
and
really
has
little
to
do
with
the
societal
effects
of
systematic
ongoing
crime,
which
is
what
the
statute
is
about.
as
to
our
first
point,
the
respondents
in
this
court
have
not
identified
the
single
one
textual
home
of
the
economic
doctrine.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
word
"enterprise",
justice
stevens,
is
defined
by
statute,
and
it
is
not
new
to
this
court.
the
notion
that
the
word
"enterprise"
can
include
this
doctrine
really
comes
from
the
ivic
case
in
the
second
circuit,
where
the
government
tried
to
use
the
statute
to
prosecute
terrorism
in
new
york
city.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
did
point
to
that
word
as
a...
xx
basis
for
the
doctrine.
everything--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--judge
friendly.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
they're
all
good
judges,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
and
even
good
judges
sometimes
get
it
wrong.
everything
the
court
said,
judge
friendly
and
all,
in
the
ivic
case
had
been
foreclosed
by
this
court
in
the
turkette
case.
there
is
practically
no
argument
in
the
ivic
opinion
that
does
not
have
a
counterpart
in
this
court's
opinion
in
turkette.
and
the
failure
of
the
enterprise
element
to
give
content
to
this
doctrine
i
think
is
not
only
demonstrated
by
what
the
court
said
in
the
turkette
case,
but
also
by
what
the
second
circuit
itself
did
with
the
doctrine
3
months
later
in
the
bagaric
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
court
in
that
case
noted
that
the
definition
by
congress
is
very
broad,
and
it
certainly
includes
any
entity
or
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact,
which,
the
court
noted,
includes
any
group
that
associates
for
a
common
purpose.
the
court
said
nothing
about
what
the
nature
of
that
purpose
must
be,
and
that's
all
the
court
said.
and,
in
fact,
as
the
lower
courts
have
recognized,
pinning
this
doctrine
on
the
enterprise
element
would
really
cripple
the
role
that
congress
thought
rico
would
play.
it
would
take
out
of
the
reach
of
rico
government
entities,
courts,
nonprofit
organizations,
all
of
which
have
uniformly
been
recognized
by
the
lower
courts
to
be
rico
enterprises,
and
which
even
respondent
scheidler,
i
think,
at
page
14
of
his
brief
concedes
are
rico
enterprises.
in
addition,
one
of
this
court's
cases,
the
h.j.,
inc.
case,
had
a
government
agency
as
a
claimed
rico
enterprise,
and
that
certainly
gave
no
pause
to
the
court
in
ruling
that
the
complaint
in
that
case
was
sufficient.
now--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
sherman
act,
justice
scalia,
in
that
it
really
does
tend
to
make
unlawful
things
that
in
the
absence
of
the
act
could
be
done
lawfully.
rico
takes
a
different
tack,
and
it
starts
with
conduct
that
is
already
criminal.
and
while
congress
said
that
as
to
the
civil
side
of
rico,
it
was
looking
to
the
antitrust
model,
this
court
has
recognized
that
that
is
not
a
model
that
the
court
should
follow
in
all
contexts.
for
example,
in
the
sedima
case
a
claim
was
made
that
based
on
the
antitrust
laws
which
called
for
some
form
of
antitrust
injury,
there
should
be
a
requirement
in
rico
that
there
be
racketeering
injury.
and
this
court
turned
down
that
argument,
saying
that
racketeering
activity
is
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
than
the
commission
of
the
predicate
crimes.
thus
while
congress
did
have
the
antitrust
model
of
civil
damages
in
mind,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
ruled
that
it...
that
every
aspect
of
rico
is
ruled
by
what
congress
has
done
in
the
antitrust
areas.
they're
similar
to
some
extent,
but
they're
not
identical.
that
brings
me--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
haven't
briefed--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
have
not
briefed
the
issue,
justice
scalia,
but
it...
because
it
is
not
the
question
on
which
the
court
granted
cert.
and
in
our
view,
whatever--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--you
could
entertain
it.
but
if
ruled
on
by
the
court,
and
even
if
ruled
on
favorably
to
the
respondents,
it
would
not,
in
the
end,
support
the
judgment,
because
in
our
view
the
facts
pled
in
the
complaint,
though
not
the
legal
theory,
do
show
other
predicate
acts
like
arson
and
other
crimes
that
are
predicate
acts
under
rico,
which
though
not
pled
as
a
legal
theory,
are
pled
as
facts
and
which
would
be...
and
which,
in
our
view,
would
be
sufficient
to
support
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
though
we
have
not
briefed
the
hobbs
act
issue,
i
should
say
that
it
is
far
from
clear
that
nothing
was
obtained
in
this
case,
taking
the
claims
in
the
complaint
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiffs.
in
the
green
case,
this
court
essentially
held
that
if
i
put
a
gun
to
your
head
and
have
you
give
your
wallet
to
the
first
person
who
comes
down
the
street,
that
is
extortion
under
the
hobbs
act,
even
though
i
get
nothing
physically.
and
the
reason
for
that
has
to
be
that
because
even
though
i
have
not
myself
obtained
your
wallet,
i
have
obtained
the
right
to
control
the
disposition
of
your
wallet
which
is,
in
itself,
a
property
right.
you
have
a
right
to
give
your
wallet
to
whom
you
please,
or
even
keep
it
yourself,
and
that's
what
you
usually
do
all
the
time.
but
if
i
put
a
gun
to
your
head
and
make
you
give
your
wallet
to
the
first
person
who
comes
down
the
street,
i
have
taken
to
you
a
right
to
control
who
should
have
your
wallet.
i
have
chosen
the
person
who
should
have
your
wallet.
and
that,
in
itself,
is
an
important
right
of
your
property
right
to
your
wallet
and
is
itself
a
property
right.
so
even
though
we
have
not
briefed
it--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
anyone
here
has
said
anything
different
about
the
governing
constitutional
standards,
and
i
don't
think
anyone
views
them
any
differently
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court.
and
there
is
no
question
that,
as
with
every
other
area,
there
will
be
issues
at
the
margins.
however,
the
issue
here
is
whether
an
economic
motive
doctrine
should
be
implied
to
take
that
danger
out
of
rico.
and
in
our
view,
it
would
be
a
poor
proxy
for
that
danger
and
it's
not
really
the
issue
at
this
stage
on
the
pleadings.
thank
you.
