justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
clayton,
do
we
have...
do
we
have
a
ruling
to
review
on
that
issue,
as
distinguished
from
the
one
that
you
were
just
discussing
with
justice
scalia?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
on
the
definition
of
enterprise
and
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
and
whether
economic
motivation
is
required
for
those,
and
that's
it,
as
far
what
is
before
us
to
review
this
morning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blakey,
i
assume
that
you're
going
to
deal,
both
with
respect
to
what
you
said
about
standing
and
what
you
said
about
no
extortion,
with
our
function
as
a
court
of
review
rather
than
as
a
court
of
first
view.
and
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
ruling
on
standing
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
quite
right
that
it's
jurisdictional.
but
it's
usual
that
we
have
the
benefit
of
a
prior
decision
on
that
question.
it's
not
common
that
this
court
makes
the
ruling
for
the
first
time
on
an
issue
of
standing.
was
this
raised
in
the
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
ms.
clayton
had
explained,
in
answer
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
the
capacity
in
which
now
is
appearing
at
this
stage,
as
distinguished
from
its
position
as
an
antitrust
claimant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was...
there
was
no
ruling
on
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
as
though
you're
here
after
there
has
been
a
denial
of
certification.
at
this
stage,
mustn't
we
assume
that
question
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
appreciate
that,
mr.
blakey,
and
i
don't
want
to
belabor
this
point.
but
you
know
that
even
for
jurisdictional
questions,
this
court
generally
sits
as
a
court
of
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
there
not...
mr.
blakey,
is
there
not
the
counterpart
of
a
bill
of
particulars
here
in
the
rico
statements
that
were
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
response
to
that
concern
was
not
any
narrowing
of
this
definition
of
enterprise
which,
on
the
face
of
it,
is
about
as
broad
as
you
can
get.
includes
any...
they
didn't...
in
response
to
the
concern
that
you
just
mentioned,
what
was
the
change
that
was
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was
the
precise
modification?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blakey,
i've
been
thinking
about
affairs,
and
it...
if
congress
wanted
to
convey
the
meaning
you
suggested,
wouldn't
it
have
said
business?
because
affairs
come
in
all
sizes
and
shapes.
there
are
private
affairs,
there
are
family
affairs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
business
fit
much
better
if
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
portray?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
don't
think
you
can
have
legitimate
and
illegitimate
affairs?
