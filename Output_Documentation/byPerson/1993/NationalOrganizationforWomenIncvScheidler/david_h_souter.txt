do
you
agree,
though,
that
if
you
look
specifically
at
the
text
of
1262(a),
(b),
and
(c),
that
in
each
of
those
instances
it
is
certainly
possible,
consistently
with
those
texts,
for
there
to
be
an
enterprise
which
is
not
itself
devoted
to
economic
gain?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
again,
i
don't
think
you're
doing
this,
but
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
only
noncommercial
example
of
an
enterprise
which
might
fit
under
(a),
(b),
or
(c),
would
be
a
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
then,
why
don't
you...
why
don't
you
go
the...
why
don't
you
go
the
whole
hog,
then,
and
say
that
the...
that
it
is
an
absolute
requirement
that
the
commercial
enterprise
in
fact...
that
the
enterprise
be
commercial,
but
you
instead
have
an
alternative
definition.
you
say,
well,
it
would
be
all
right
if
the
acts
themselves,
if
the
predicate
acts
were
commercial.
why...
why...
if
your
argument
is
as
strong
as
you
say
it
is,
why
do
you
have
this
fallback
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
it
would
be
insufficient
to
get
you
over
the
rico
standing?
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
isn't
it...
why
isn't
it
still
the
case
that
your...
the
point
of
your
argument
is
that
extortion
should
be
construed
narrowly
so
that
it
does
not
include
coercion,
but
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
what
enterprise
means.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
congress...
by
the
same
token,
congress
doesn't
have
to
do
the
same
thing
three
different
ways.
and
if,
in
fact,
it
was
addressing
the
concerns
that
the
aclu
raised
by
its
definition
of
predicate
offense,
that
is
not
a
premise
for
saying
that
it
therefore
also
intended
enterprise
to
be
narrowed
in
the
way...
with
the
limitation
that
you
want
to
place
on
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
it
was
a
limitation
on
what,
by
analogy,
we
would
call
the
predicate
acts,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
limitations
that
mr.
blakey
was
referring
to
are
those
which,
by
analogy,
we
would
refer
to
as
limitations
on
the
predicate
acts
which
would
suffice?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
certainly
would
not
support
the
argument
that...
that
enterprise...
in
this
case,
that
enterprise
has
to
be
so
limited.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they're
acting
for
commercial
motives,--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
agree
with
that
decision?
