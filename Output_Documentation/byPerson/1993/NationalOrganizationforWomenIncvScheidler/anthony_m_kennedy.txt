anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
if...
if
we
rule
as
you
ask
us
to
in
the
question
presented,
that
does
not
prevent
the
defendants
from
raising
first
amendment
defenses
below.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
those
issues
are
not
presented
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but--
--but
that,
it
seems
to
me,
contradicts
your
argument
in
which
you
pin
your
entire
argument
on
the
word
"affairs".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
i've
been
meaning
to
add
as
a
footnote
that
murder
is
included.
that's
not
necessarily
an
economic
crime.
it
usually
isn't
in
fact--
