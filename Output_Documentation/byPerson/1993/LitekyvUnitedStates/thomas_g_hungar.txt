mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
28
u.s.c.
section
455(a)
was
intended
to
overturn
the
fundamental
principle
of
recusal
law
that
a
judge's
unfavorable
attitudes
towards
a
party
are
generally
not
disqualifying
unless
they
have
an
extrajudicial
source.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the
eleventh
circuit
and
every
other
court
of
appeals
to
address
the
question,
justice
ginsburg,
has
recognized
a
pervasive
bias
exception
to
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement.
the
eleventh
circuit
did
that
in
the
mcwhorter
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
we
cite
a
number
of
other
decisions
for
that
proposition
as
well.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did
there,
your
honor,
is
state
the
general
rule.
it
didn't
refer
to
the
pervasive
bias
exception,
which
clearly
exists
under
eleventh
circuit
law
and
under
the
law
of
the
other
circuits,
because
petitioners
never
claimed...
never
relied
on
that
argument.
all
petitioner...
the
only
issue
presented
to
the
eleventh
circuit
was
this
extrajudicial
source
requirement
argument
that
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
does
not
exist
with
respect
to
claims
made
under
section
455(a).
the
eleventh
circuit
implicitly
rejected
that
argument,
and
since
there
was
no
other
argument
being
made
by
petitioners
with
respect
to
the
recusal
motion,
did
not
address
the
pervasive
bias
issue,
and
of
course,
for
the
same
reason
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
the
only
question
presented
by
petitioners
is
whether
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
applies
under
section
455(a),
but
we
certainly
believe,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
indicated,
that
there
is
a
pervasive
bias
exception
to
handle
the
egregious
cases
where
a
reasonable
person
would
believe,
based
on
the
judge's
actions
arising
solely
out
of
judicial
proceedings,
that
the
judge
is
pervasively
biased
against
a
party
and
therefore
should
not--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--correct.
correct.
the
eleventh
circuit
stated
the
general
rule.
it
didn't
refer
to
the
exceptions,
because
the
exception
had
not
been
raised
in
this
case,
but
the
eleventh
circuit
has
not
applied
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
as
an
ironclad
rule,
nor
has
any
other
court
that
we're
aware
of,
and
we
don't
believe
that
it
is
an
ironclad
rule.
what
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
reflects
is
the
common
sense
notion
that
as
a
general
matter
it's
not
reasonable
to
infer
disqualifying
bias
from
the
fact
that
a
judge
has
formed
opinions
about
the
parties
or
the
merits
of
the
case
based
on
what
the
judge
has
learned
in
the
course
of
presiding
over
a
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
we
believe
that
the
language
of
section
455(a),
which
refers
explicitly
to
a
reasonableness
requirement,
a
rule
of
reason
is
certainly
not
inconsistent
with
the
extrajudicial
source
doctrine
as
it
has
developed
over
the
years,
because
that
doctrine,
as
we
indicate,
has
a
pervasive
bias
exception,
but
it
is
simply
in
keeping
with
the
normal
perceptions
of
a
reasonable,
fully
informed
observer,
that
as
a
general
matter,
when
a
judge
makes
credibility
findings
or
rules
on
the
merits,
or
acts
in
any
number
of
ways
that
may
be
perceived
as
unfair
by
a
party,
as
long
as
the
judge
is
doing
that
based
on
what
the
judge
views
to
be
the
facts
and
the
law
as
set
forth
in
the
case,
that's
not
a
proper
basis
for
recusal.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
obviously,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
difficult
to
draw
precise
lines
in
this
area.
that
might
well
rise
to
the
level
of
pervasive
bias.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
fifth
circuit,
for
example,
in
a
case
cited
in
petitioner's
reply
brief,
united
states
v.
holland,
found
pervasive
bias
where
a
defendant
invited
an
error
by
the
trial
judge
and
then
obtained
reversal
on
that
ground
and
the
case
was
sent
back
to
the
same
judge.
the
judge
then
stated
on
the
record
that
the
defendant
had
betrayed
the
judge,
had
broken
faith
with
the
judge,
and
that
as
a
consequence
the
judge
was
going
to
increase
his
sentence
to
punish
him
for
doing
this
and
to
make
sure
he
didn't
waste
the
government's
money
with
a
future
trial,
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
that
was
pervasive
bias,
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
judicial
and
that
it
didn't
involve
anything--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
think
that
the...
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it's
not
irrelevant,
justice
kennedy,
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
what...
the
way
these
cases
are
actually
litigated
is
that
parties
tend
to
dislike
rulings
by
judges,
and
then
they
may
be
able
to
point
to
a
few
stray
comments
by
a
judge
that
imitate...
that
indicate
some
irritation,
and
putting
those
unfavorable
rulings
and
the
few
stray
comments
together,
they
try
and
claim
that
recusal
is
required,
and--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
courts
of
appeals,
your
honor,
have
had
no
difficulty
separating
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
in
this
area.
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
come
up
in
the
courts
of
appeals
can
be
either
dispensed
with
readily
simply
by
applying
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
even
if
there's
no
allegation
of
pervasive
bias
at
all,
or
it's
so
clear
from
the
facts
that
it
doesn't
rise
to
that
level
that
they
need
not
conduct
the
kind
of
fact-intensive
scrutiny
of
the
transcript
and
the
rulings
in
this
trial
and
in
previous
trials
the
petitioners
would
have
the
courts
conduct
in
every
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
requirement...
i
believe
that
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
difficult
to
read
into
the
language
of
455(a)
the
rather
awkward
and
time-consuming
procedures
that
petitioners
are
suggesting
are
there,
and
what's
more--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--with
respect,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
not,
because,
of
course,
the
language
"reasonableness"
necessarily
implies
some
flexibility
and
congress
obviously
intended
the
courts
to
have
some
flexibility
in
applying
that
statute.
what
i
think
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement,
as
it
has
existed
over
the
past
80
years,
reflects,
is
the
common
sense
notion
and
determination
by
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
that
in
general
it's
not
reasonable
to
question...
to
infer
disqualifying
bias
based
on
the
fact
that
a
judge
has
developed
points
of
view
about
a
matter
based
on
what
the
judge
has
learned
in
the
course
of
conducting
judicial
proceedings.
now,
there
may
be--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--exactly.
that's
correct.
it's
not
partiality
for
a
judge
to
develop
points
of
view
about
the
matter
based
on
what
the
judge
has
learned
in
conducting
judicial
proceedings
absent
unusual
circumstances,
so
a
reasonable
person--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
word
455(a)
is
leave
to
the
courts
a
certain
degree
of
discretion
in
defining
the
types
of
judicial
conduct
that
should
lead
to
recusal.
we
believe
that
in
so
doing
congress
did
not...
certainly
did
not
expressly
indicate
and
did
not
implicitly
indicate
any
intention
to
overturn
the
traditional
rules
that
have
governed
recusal
for
bias
in
this
area,
and
one
of
those
traditional
rules
that
have
governed
recusal
for
bias
in
this
area,
and
one
of
those
traditional
rules,
of
course,
is
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
which
has
existed
in
the
federal
courts
for
as
long
as
there
has
been
such
a
thing
as
recusal
for
bias.
recusal
for
bias
was
not
recognized
at
common
law,
and
it
was
not
available
in
the
federal
courts
until
1911,
when
congress
enacted
the
predecessor
to
28
u.s.c.
section
144.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg.
the
statute
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
doctrine.
the
doctrine
has
been
the
backdrop
against
which
the
federal
courts
have
analyzed
claims
of
recusal
for
bias
for
as
long
as
there
has
been
such
a
thing
as
recusal
for
bias,
and
congress
never
evidenced
any
intention
to
eliminate
that
requirement
either
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement,
or
in
the
legislative
history,
which
to
the
extent
it
addresses
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
at
all,
suggests
that
that
requirement
was
not
expected
to
be
eliminated.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
sense
for
congress
to
refer
to
personal
bias
in
455(a).
455(a)
was
aimed
primarily
at
an
entirely
different
issue.
not
at
recusal
for
bias
at
all,
but
at--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--with
respect,
justice
souter,
even
assuming...
and
i
think
it
is
correct
that
section
455(a)
can,
of
course,
give
rise
to
grounds
for
recusal
for
bias,
but
it
wouldn't
have
made
sense
for
congress
in
an
all-encompassing
provision
that
is
aimed
not
merely
at
recusal
for
bias
but
at
recusal
for
interest,
recusal
for
relationship,
and
indeed,
from
everything
we
can
tell
from
the
legislative
history,
was
adopted
specifically
with
reference
to
the
law
of
recusal
for
interest,
and
not
with
respect
to
the
law
of
recusal
for
bias.
so
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
sense
for
congress
to
include
a
reference
to
personal
bias
in
a
statute
that
wasn't
aimed
exclusively
at
bias,
and
indeed
was
aimed
primarily
at
interest
and
relationship,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
personal
bias.
congress
adopted
a
general
standard
in
section
455(a).
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
the
reason
congress
adopted
that
standard,
what
it
hoped
to
accomplish
by
doing
so,
was
to
change
the
law
of
recusal
for
interest
as
it
had
developed
under
the
previous
version
of
section
455.
prior
to
1974,
section
455
addressed
only
recusal
for
interest
and
relationship.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
recusal
for
bias,
and
congress
when
it
amended
the
statute
in
1974
made
clear
that
the
purpose
of
that
amendment
with
respect
to
section
455(a)
was
to
change
two
aspects
of
the
law
of
recusal
for
interest
as
it
had
developed
under
section
455,
namely
this.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
this
court
has
never
based...
despite
what
the
petitioner
claims
about
this
court's
decision
in
the
grinnell
corporation
case,
this
court
has
never
identified
the
word
144
as
the
basis
for
the
extrajudicial
source
doctrine.
i
think,
fairly
read,
this
court's
decisions
simply
reflect,
as
i
said,
the
common
sense
notion
that
it's
generally
not
reasonable
to
question
a
judge's
impartiality
if
the
judge
is
forming
opinions
based
on
what
the
judge
hears
in
the
case.
that's
what
judges
are
supposed
to
do.
that's
what
they
do
every
day,
and
that's
what
a
reasonable
observer
would
expect
them
to
do.
but
if
a
judge
is
forming
opinions
about
the
parties
or
the
case
based
on
something
totally
extraneous
to
the
case,
something
that
the
judge
has
read
in
the
newspaper
or
been
told
at
the
country
club,
then
i
think
a
reasonable
person
would
tend
to
question
the
judge's
impartiality.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
that's
how
this
doctrine
that
has
existed
for
80
years
has
been
applied
by
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
that's
consistent--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i'm
not
sure.
it
has
to
be...
it
has
been
fleshed
out
by
the
courts
of
appeals
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
and
obviously
it
would--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that
might
be
as
good
a
way
of
putting
it
as
any,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
think
the
case
i
mentioned,
the
fifth
circuit
case
by
definition,
since
that's--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
it
doesn't
really
matter,
justice
ginsburg,
how
it's
characterized.
i
think
the
point
is
that
this
doctrine
as
it
has
existed
for
as
long
as
there
has
been
recusal
for
bias
allows
for
an
exception
in
egregious
cases,
pervasive
bias
cases,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
and
that
that
approach
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
section
455(a),
so
we
cannot
infer
from
the
language
of
section
455(a)
any
congressional
intention
to
dispense
with--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
we
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--precisely,
and
the
justice...
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
not
construed
the
pervasive
bias
exception
to
require
multiple
incidents
throughout.
if
one
statement
is
sufficiently
evidence
of
bias,
then
it
is
disqualified.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
it
gets
us
the
judgment,
because
they
never
raised
the
pervasive
bias
argument,
either
in
the
district
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
or
in
this
court.
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
whether--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--this
case
has
been
litigated
from
the
beginning
on
the
ground
that
petitioners
lose
if
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
survived
enactment
of
section
455(a).
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
and
part
of
the
interpretation
of
this
doctrine
as
it
has
existed.
this
case
is
not
about
pervasive
bias,
both
because
the
petitioners
haven't
alleged
it
and
because
i
think
any
fair
reading
of
the
claims
they
asserted
in
their
brief,
without
getting
any
further
into
the
transcript
and
the
merits
of
the
judge's
ruling,
plainly
indicates
that
the
judge
is
not
so
biased
against
the
defendants
that
recusal
is
plainly
required,
but
more
to
the
point,
section
455(a)
and
the
language
of
that
statute,
as
we've
indicated,
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement,
including
the
pervasive
bias
exception.
whether,
as
a
matter
of
first
impression,
this
court
would
have
adopted
precisely
the
same
approach
to
recusal
for
bias
if
faced
with
the
language
of
section
455(a)
and
nothing
else,
is
beside
the
point.
the
point
is
that
because
the
doctrine,
which
has
existed
from
the
beginning
of
this
entire
area
of
the
law,
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
section
455(a),
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
that
congress
did
not
indicate
any
intention
to
eliminate
that
doctrine
when
it
enacted
section
455(a).
and
the
legislative
history
likewise
not
only
doesn't
indicate
any
intention
to
eliminate
that
doctrine,
but
to
the
extent
it
addresses
that
issue
at
all,
suggests
that
congress
was
led
to
believe
that
the
doctrine
would
continue
to
exist.
this
court
said,
in
the
midlantic
national
bank
case,
that
if
congress
intends
to
eliminate...
excuse
me.
if
congress
intends
to
change
the
interpretation
of
a
judicially
created
concept,
it
makes
that
intent
specific.
for
that
reason,
petitioners,
not
the
government,
bear
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
congress
intended
to
change
the
law,
intended
to
eliminate
the
judicially
created
extrajudicial
source
doctrine--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
that
assumes
the
conclusion,
justice
stevens.
we
submit
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--not
with
respect
to
recusal
for
bias.
that's
what
this
case
is
about,
justice
stevens.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
section
144
also
addressed
the
appearance
of
bias.
contrary
to
what
petitioners
say,
it
was
not...
section
144
did
not
have
and
does
not
have
a
subjective
test.
it's
not
up
to
the
judge
to
decide
whether
in
fact
he
or
she
is
biased.
the
question
is
whether
the
parties
have
alleged,
(a)
that
the
judge
is
biased,
and
(b)
have
alleged
facts
that,
if
true--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--it's
up
to
the
judge
to
decide
the
motion,
your
honor.
the
question,
though,
under
both
section
144
and
455(a)
is
whether
the
facts
are
such
as
to
create,
in
the
language
of
section
455(a)
to
cause
a
reasonable
person
to
question
the
judge's
impartiality,
or
under
144
and
the
language
of
this
court,
whether
they
are
such
as
to
fairly
support
the
charge
that
the
judge
might
be
partial.
it
doesn't
require
a
finding
that
the
judge
actually
is
biased.
so
in
both...
under
both
statutes,
there's
an
appearance
rather
than
an
actuality
focus
to
the
statute,
so
we
think
that's
one
reason
why
section
455(a)
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
approach
followed
by
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
under
section
144,
and
why
section
455(a)
can't
be
construed
to
eliminate
or
to
overturn
that
approach.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
holland
case--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
the
holland
case
is
the
only
one
that
comes
to
mind.
certainly
the
cases
we've
cited
in
our
brief
all
recognize
the
pervasive
bias
exception.
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
find
it
in
those
cases
or
not.
but
this
case...
the
central
focus
of
our
submission
is
not
on
the
pervasive
bias
exception
at
al.
it
doesn't...
even
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
the
pervasive
bias
exception,
our
argument
would
be
the
same,
because
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement,
which
is
what
disposes
of
99
percent
of
the
cases
that
come
up
in
this
area,
is
something
that
has
existed
for
as
long
as
recusal
for
bias
has
existed.
congress
didn't
evidence
any
intention
that
it
wanted
to
change
that
aspect
of
the
law
of
recusal...
that
is,
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
and
the
law
of
recusal
for
bias.
what
congress
indicated
when
it
enacted
section
455
in
1974
was
that
it
wanted
to
change
the
law
of
recusal
for
interest,
because
the
law
of
recusal
for
interest
was
unsatisfactory
if
you
had
a
subjective
test,
and
congress
didn't
want
to
have
a
subjective
test.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
if
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there's
no
indication
that
anything
the
judge
did
in
this
case
or
the
early
case--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--had
an
extrajudicial
source.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no.
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
has
never
been
applied
so
as
to
permit
reference
to
things
that
happen
in
the
course
of
judicial
proceedings.
if
a
judge,
in
the
course
of
judicial
proceedings,
says,
i'm
going
to
rule
against
you
because
you
are
hispanic
and
i
don't
like
hispanics,
that
is
extrajudicial
bias.
the
judge
has
an
invidious
discriminatory
animus
towards
hispanics,
and
that
is
not
a
proper
basis
on
which
to
rule,
and
the
judge
should
be
disqualified,
so
you
have
to
look
at
that...
depending
on
the
allegations,
you
might
have
to
look--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
it's
not,
your
honor,
because
the
judge
based
that
opinion,
based
on
what
the
judge
saw
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
on
the
facts
and
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
certainly,
your
honor,
the
law
as
it
existed
under
section
144
and
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement,
and
as
we
claim
should
continue
to
exist,
provides
that
a
judge's
philosophical
views
of
the
law
are
not
a
proper
basis
for
recusal.
we,
at
least,
agree
with
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
would
be
an
extrajudicial
source.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
because--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
question
is
not
where
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--precisely.
precisely,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
because
as
we
have
suggested,
this...
and
the
logic
of
the
court's
ruling
in
this
area
over
the
past
80
years
is
consistent
with
this.
it's
simply
not
reasonable
to--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
that's
right,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
think
we
presume
that
there
is
some
extrajudicial
source
for
that
basis,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
so
said.
justice
kennedy
in
the
united
states
v.--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
but
if
the
in-court
conduct...
if
the
judge
evidences
an
extrajudicial
bias,
that
is,
the
reason
the
judge
is
doing
something
in
court
is
because
the
judge
is
biased
against
a
particular
class,
a
particular
race
of
defendants,
or
what
have
you,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
uniformly
said
that
that
is
extrajudicial.
justice
kennedy
in
the
united
states
v.
conforte
case
for
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
courts
of
appeals
have
applied
the...
have
found
that
alleged
bias
is
judicial
if
it's
based
on
what
the
judge
learned
about
a
defendant
in
the
course
of
conducting
trials
involving--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--there's
no
question,
your
honor,
that
if
the
judge
displays
in
invidious
racial
or
religious--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
yes,
although
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
that
question,
of
course,
has
never
arisen,
and
i
think
is
very
unlikely
to
arise,
but
if
it
did
arise,
i
think
the
courts
of
appeals
would
say,
because
they
have
been
so
concerned
to
ferret
out
class-based
animus
of
that
nature,
i
think
they
would,
and
quite
properly,
require
that
the
judge
be
recused.
but
again,
this
a
doctrine,
a
judicial--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
source
is
directly
relevant
to
that
inquiry,
justice
kennedy.
if
a
judge
says
to
a
defendant,
i
find
you
are
not
credible
because
my
sister
told
me
so,
we
are
much
more
concerned
than
if
the
judge
says
to
a
defendant,
i
find,
based
on
the
way
you've
testified
and
your
appearance
and
the
kinds
of
things
you
say
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
that
you
are
not
credible,
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy.
it's
not
bias
in
the
second
case
because
the
judge
is
acting
based
on
what
the
judge
is
supposed
to
act--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
our
submission,
justice
kennedy,
that
there
is
no
bias
within
the
meaning
of
section
455,
and
the
doctrine
of
recusal
for
bias
as
a
general
rule,
at
least,
if
a
judge
forms
opinions
about
the
parties
based
on
what
the
judge
has
learned
in
the
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
again--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
it
might
be
grounds
for
reversal,
your
honor.
it
might
be
grounds
for
a
finding
of
pervasive
bias.
it's
not
clear
how
the
courts
of
appeals
would
respond
to
that
type
of
hypothetical.
obviously,
at
the
margin
there
are
always
going
to
be
difficult
cases,
but
in
reality--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
wouldn't
acknowledge
that.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
it
depends
on
the
facts.
if
the
judge...
i
mean,
it's
a--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--fairly
ridiculous
hypothetical,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no.
i
think
if
that's
the
only
thing
he
says
it's
probably
judicial.
it
depends,
though.
if
the
judge
says
something
suggesting
a
class-based
animus
towards
eye-twitchers,
i
don't
know.
that
might--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that
might
constitute
an
extrajudicial
source.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
may
or
may
not
be
easier,
justice
souter,
but
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
this
court's
cases
defining
the
appropriate
approach
to
statutory
construction.
i
think
what
i
hear
members
of
the
court
saying
is
that
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
as
we
define
it
is
consistent
with
the
language
of
section
455,
but
that
it
might
be
equally
appropriate
to
define...
to
interpret
the
language
of
section
455(a)
to
adopt
a
rule
that's
phrased
differently
but
the
results
are
the
same.
that
being
the
case,
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
is
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
so
congress
cannot
be
deemed
to
have
eliminated
that
requirement.
thank
you.
