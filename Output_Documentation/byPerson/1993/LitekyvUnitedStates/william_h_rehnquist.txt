chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
92-6921,
john
patrick
liteky
v.
united
states.
mr.
thompson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
were
petty
misdemeanors,
how
did
they
get
into
federal
court?
was
it
a
federal
enclave
type
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
now,
let's
find
out
what
kind
of
bias
we're
talking
about.
supposing
that
you're
in
a
many-judge
trial
court
and,
as
is
common,
some
of
those
judges
have
a
reputation
for
being
proplaintiff
in
personal
injury
cases,
and
some
have
a
reputation
for
being
prodefendant.
is
that
the
sort
of
bias
that
could
be
attacked
by
this
section?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
not
a
disfavor
or
dislike
of
a
particular
kind
of
lawsuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there...
let
me
ask
you
another
question
about
the
kind
of
bias
we're
talking
about.
is
it
limited
to
the
situation
where
the
claim
is
made
that
a
judge
would
disfavor
the
litigant
in
making
the
affidavit
in
a
way
that
he
would
not
disfavor
another
litigant
who
had
exactly
the
same
sort
of
legal
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
i'm...
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
something
a
little
different.
supposing
that
you
could
show
that
judge
elliott
treated
your
clients
in
your
view
hostilely,
and
that
a
reasonable
person
would
think
it
was,
but
that
it
was
also...
it
could
also
be
shown
that
he
treated
virtually
all
people
who
were
arrested
for
protesting
at
fort
benning,
if
there
were
a
number
of
them,
the
same
way.
now,
would
that
be
sufficient?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
where
do
you
draw
the
line
between
that
and
someone
who
is
not
at
all
friendly
to
plaintiffs'
personal
injury
suits
but
treats
all
plaintiffs,
personal
injury
plaintiffs,
with
equal
"hostility"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
way
you're
going
at
it
i
think
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
it's
difficult
in
a
particular
case
for
a
judge
to
make
it,
i
certainly
agree
with
you,
but
don't
we
have
to
have
some
uniform
definition
of
bias
before
we
can
get
at
the
reasonableness
and
so
forth,
which
may
be
very
difficult?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thompson.
mr.
hungar,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--supposing
that
a
judge...
take
in
this
1983
trial,
judge
elliott
had
made
rulings
that
were
beyond
challenge
at
all,
and...
but
commented
when
the
defendant
finally
was
led
off
to
where...
you
know,
i
think
you're
a
worthless,
mealy-mouthed
little
tool,
and
i
hope
i
never
see
you
in
this
court
again.
now,
is
that
pervasive
bias?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
that
doesn't,
what
would?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then,
i
don't
think
pervasive
is
quite
the
right
word
for
the
kind
of
bias
you
accept.
i
wonder
if
it
isn't
personal,
as
opposed
to
kind
of
philosophical,
as
your
example
from
the
fifth
circuit
would
indicate.
the
trial
judge
was
not
opposed
to
any
particular
class
of
litigants.
he
just
didn't
like
what
this
particular
litigant
had
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it's
not
as
if
the
pervasive
bias
exception
were
set
forth
in
the
statute
as
a
kind
of
affirmative
defense.
i
mean,
it's
all
part
of
the
interpretation
of
455(a),
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
judge
says
to
somebody,
say
a
man
during
a
divorce
trial,
that
after
hearing
what
you
did
in
this
case,
i'm
simply
appalled,
and
i
can't
believe
any
human
being
would
do
that.
now,
is
that...
the
guy
comes
up
in
another
trial
and
says,
you're
biased
against
me.
is
that
extrajudicial
source,
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
good
sense,
then.
maybe
that
doesn't
mean
it
shouldn't
be
the
law.
what
we're
really
talking
about
here--
[laughter]
what
we're
really
talking
about
here
is
philosophical
bias,
and
that
we
don't
want
a
judge
disqualified
for
philosophical
bias,
and
usually
that
will
come
up...
the
judge's
philosophical
approach
will
come
up
as
a
result
of
rulings
during
the
trial.
but
something
could
come
up
during
the
trial,
simply
poisons
the
judge's
mind
in
a
way
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
philosophical
approach,
and
it
seems
to
me
perhaps
that
is
a
better
example
than
the
kind
of
other
examples
of
pervasive
bias.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
he
have
read
a
book
out
of
court
about
eye-twitchers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
thompson,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
harsh
language
toward
the
judges
of
the
eleventh
circuit?
yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thompson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-6921,
liteky
versus
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
