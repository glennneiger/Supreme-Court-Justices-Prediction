mr.
peter
j.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there,
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
recusal
motions
of
federal
judges
under
28
united
states
code
section
455(a)
have
to
be
considered
with
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
and
therefore
the
arguments
concerning
a
judge's
conduct
in
the
courtroom
were
improper
and
they
did
not
need
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
such
a
motion,
and
therefore
affirmed
the
conviction
of
my
three
clients.
in
1983,
by
way
of
background
as
to
these
convictions
and
to
this
motion
to
recuse,
father
bourgeois,
father
rosebaugh,
and
ms.
ventimiglia
were
arrested
and
convicted
in
georgia
of
various
petty
misdemeanors
before
the
honorable
j.
robert
elliott
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
it
was.
it
was
a
federal
reservation
on
the
fort
benning
base.
so
because
they
were
petty
misdemeanors,
chief
justice,
it
was
a
bench
trial.
that
bench
trial
obviously
generated
a
transcript.
there
were
sentences.
there
was
no
appeal
from
that
case.
in
1991,
father
bourgeois,
charles
liteky
and
pat
liteky
were
charged
again
with
regard
to
activities
on
the
fort
benning
military
base,
this
time
with
a
felony,
and
as
a
result
of
that
indictment
were
brought
before
judge
elliott,
the
same
judge
who
had
presided
at
the
1983
case,
and
filed
a
motion
to
recuse
judge
elliott
based
largely,
in
fact
almost
exclusively,
on
his
conduct
in
the
1983
case
and
attached
as
part
of
that
motion
not
only
argument
but
a
transcript
of
the
1983
proceeding.
judge
elliott
denied
the
motion,
rejected
the
motion,
citing
the
leading
fifth
circuit
and
eleventh
circuit
cases
which
have
an
extrajudicial
source
requirement
for
455
federal
recusal
motions
and
indicated
because
the
events
that
were
alleged
requiring
the
recusal
arose
in
the
courtroom,
that
is,
part
of
the
judicial
proceedings,
that
judicial
conduct
need
not
be
considered
under
455(a).
the
eleventh
circuit,
as
i
held...
as
i
indicated
affirmed
that.
after
the
recusal
motion
was
denied,
there
was
another
trial
in
1991,
this
time
with
a
jury.
it
was
a
day-and-a-half
trial,
and
that
resulted
in
convictions
and
sentences
of
the
defendant.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
there
was
not
in
the
1983
case,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
not
a
concern
that
i've
seen
raised
by
the
government
in
this
case
concerning
that.
there
was--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
substitute
for
the
appeal
because
it
would
be
governed
by
substantially
different
standards.
that
is,
if
there
had
been
a
direct
appeal
to
the
eleventh
circuit
in
1983
on
fair
trail
grounds,
it
would
be
judged
by
abuse
of
discretion,
whereas
that
appeal
conceivably
and
academically
could
be
lost,
and
it
could
still
arise
under
455(a)
to
a
possibility
or
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
partiality
under
that
statute
and
require
recusal,
even
though
there
had
been
an
affirmance
in
1983,
so
i
don't
think
those
are
exact
comparable
issues.
the
face
of--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's...
the
petition
for
this
writ
of
certiorari
is
limited
to
455(a).
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
i
do
not,
your
honor,
because
personal
bias
or
prejudice
since
united
states
v.
grinnell
in
1966
means
extrajudicial
conduct,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--i
accept
that.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
i
accept
that.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
exactly.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
and
i
think
the
face
of
the
statute
supports
exactly
that
distinction,
and
that
is
really,
i
think,
what
clearly
is
to
be
decided
here.
the
statute
reads,
"any
justice,
judge,
or
magistrate
of
the
united
states
shall
disqualify
himself
in
any
proceeding
in
which
his
impartiality
might
reasonably
be
questioned.
"
it
doesn't
say
personal,
as
455(b)
says.
it
doesn't
say
personal,
as
to
144
says.
personal
has
been
held
to
be
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement.
this
statute,
plainly
on
its
face
and
for
many
good
policy
reasons
that
are
enunciated
by
this
court
in
liljeberg
and
by
congress
to
apply
to
any
conduct
of
the
judge.
in
other
words,
the
source
of
the
bias,
whether
it
be
through
judicial
conduct
or
through
extrajudicial
conduct,
is
totally
irrelevant.
what
is
important
for
the
court
system
and
the
integrity
of
the
judiciary
that
if
there
is
bias,
it
need
be
considered.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
not,
in
my
view.
in
other
words,
those
sort
of
judicial
proclivities
or
philosophies
are
not
bias.
what
bias
is
is
not
the
manner
of
ruling
in
a
particular
case
or
the
judgments
in
a
case.
it
is
the
conduct
that
a
judge
engages
in
which
indicates
a
kind
of
inclination
or
favoritism
or
hostility,
or
some
of
those
kinds
of
things,
against
or
for
a
party
which
would
render
a
reasonable
person
to
question
impartiality.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
not
at
all.
in
fact--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there
is
substantial
similarity.
the
judge
would
be
looking
at
the
same
sort
of
facts.
the
judge
would
have
the
transcript
in
front
of
him
or
her.
the
differences
would
be
that
the
judge
would
not
only
be
looking
at
the
transcript
with
a
view
toward
whether
or
not
they
are
biased,
or
lack
impartiality.
that
is,
they
couldn't
sit
in
the
next
case.
the
judge
under
this
standard,
and
this
is
what
the
congress
has
said
should
be
done,
should
look
at
it
from
the
observation
of
a
reasonable
person.
not
from
their
own
standard,
viewpoint,
as
a
reasonable
person,
whether
that
reasonable
person
would
then
harbor
a
doubt
as
to
their
impartiality,
and
so
it
makes
sense
in
a
way,
although
difficult
for
a
judge
to
do
it
him
or
herself,
because
by
looking
at
it,
the
judge
may
think
that
the
actions
were
justifiable
but
may
reflect
and
may
have
their
recollections
so
refreshed
that
they
would
think
perhaps
if
a
reasonable
person
was
sitting
it
might
look
as
if
i
shouldn't
then
sit
in
this
next
case.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
exactly,
and
that's
exactly
why
455(a)
was
passed,
because
at
the
time
it
was
passed,
it
was
passed
to
conform
with
the
code
of
judicial
conduct
which
had
just
been
passed
by
the
american
bar
association,
which
incorporated
for
the
first
time
in
these
statutes
an
appearance
of
impropriety
standard
rather
than
actual
bias.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
if...
under
455(a)
the
affidavit
is
not
required.
that's
required
under
144.
i
think
whether
or
not
the
person
actually
makes
the
recusal
motion
would
go
beyond
where
we
are
asserting
the
court
should
really
draw
the
line.
in
other
words,
the
process
itself
of
filing
the
motion
to
recuse
for
a
practicing
lawyer
certainly
would
be
something
not
done
lightly
and
be
done
with
great
consideration,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
proceedings
that
occurred
before
then
in
court
which
were
judicial
in
nature
should
be
considered
by
the
judge
in
passing
on
the
motion.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
i'm
not
sure
if
that
would
be
sufficient.
it
would
certainly
be
probative,
and
if
a
pattern
of
conduct
could
be
established
that
in
every
case
where
someone
who
was
in
the
same
position
of
the
defendant
in
those
situations,
it
would
be
probative
as
to
bias,
but--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--where
you
draw
the
lines,
your
honor,
i
think
is
very
difficult.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
i
think...
you
know,
congress,
by
passing
this
statute,
a
broad
statute
like
this,
basically
indicated
that
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
make
these
determinations.
i
don't--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--i
was
reviewing
on
sunday
afternoon
some
of
the
cases
and
articles,
and
i
wrote
out,
although
i
wasn't
asked
to
and
it
wasn't
part
of
the
tasks
for
the
briefs,
because
i
thought
this
might
come
up,
a
definition
of
bias
as
i
think
it
would
fit
into
the
standards
that
were
applicable
in
455(a),
and
what
i
came
up
with
was
this:
circumstances
that
would
lead
a
reasonable
person
to
question
whether
the
judge's
inclination
or
state
of
mind
toward
a
party
belies
favor
or
aversion
of
a
degree
or
kind
that
might
affect
the
judge's
impartiality
in
the
case.
i
think
a
more
exacting
definition
of
bias
or
of
the
standard,
or
to
anticipate
all
the
different
ways
in
which
it
could
come
up,
such
as
the
court's
hypothetical
about
protestors
at
fort
benning,
would
be
almost
impossible,
and
it
needs
to,
of
course,
be
handled
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i've
been
a
criminal
defense
lawyer
for
25
years,
and
i've
never
brought
a
recusal
motion
before,
and
i've
been
before
many
stern
judges.
a
filing
of
a
recusal
motion
in
federal
court
would
be,
in
most
instances,
i
think...
because
of
some
of
the
dynamics
that
the
chief
justice
has
indicated
would
not
be
a
good
idea,
because
for
the
very
interests
of
the
client,
particularly
if
there
weren't
very
good
grounds,
because
then
your
client
is
going
to
be
before
that
judge,
having
had
your
recusal
motion
denied,
for
sentencing
at
a
later
time.
you'd
lose
the
case.
so
i
think
there
are
some
definite
prophylactic
things
that
are
built
into
the
standard.
the
other
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
is,
really,
in
the
system
right
now,
we
have
the
same
thing
happening,
only
it's
not
under
455(a)
where
it
should
be.
we
have
it
done
under
inherent
authority
of
the
federal
courts.
in
other
words,
every
court
of
appeal
removes
judges
in
cases
under
their
inherent
authority
for
their
conduct
in
the
courtroom,
whether
or
not
they
have
adopted
extrajudicial
source
requirement
or
not.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
number
1,
in
many
courts
of
appeal,
what
they
are
using
is
a
much
stricter
standard
than
this
statute
requires.
that
is
a
pervasive
bias
standard,
and
for
the
courts
to
maintain
their
appearance
of
impartiality,
this
more
liberal
standard
should
be
applied,
and
number
2,
because
this
is
exactly
the
scheme
that
congress
set
up.
it
set
it
up
to
do
it
on
this
standard,
and
it
set
it
up
to
do
it
under
the
appearance
of
impropriety
and
it
set
it
up
so
the
sitting
judge
would
do
it
in
the
first
instance.
if
there
aren't
any
other
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
you
mean
in
the
1983
or
the
1991
trial?
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
the
only
misconduct
that
is
specifically
alleged
on
this
petition
is
the
failure
to
look
at
the
whole
transcript,
so
we're
clear
on
that.
i'm
not
accusing
a
judge
of
a
particular
factual
matter,
but
the
factual
matters
as
are
set
out
in
1983,
i
have
summarized
ten
different
events
which
i
think,
looked
at
in
the
total
context
of
that
trial,
would
raise
an
appearance
of
bias.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
in...
one
of
the
ten
in
1983,
and
i
would
say
when
judge
elliott...
father
rosebaugh
got
up
to
give
a
closing
argument,
and
judge
elliott,
who
was
the
finder
of
fact
in
that
case
because
it
was
a
bench
trial,
so
severely
criticized
father
rosebaugh
for
giving
a
statement
when
he
hadn't
testified
at
trial
that
father
rosebaugh
was
obviously
intimidated
and
stopped
and
abandoned
his
argument,
and
then--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--it's--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--and
i
knew
that
as
soon
as
i
gave
one
out
of
the
ten
in
'83,
or
one
out
of
the
ten
in
'91,
i
could
be
met
with
that
rejoinder.
that
is,
it
may
be
perfectly
appropriate
in
any
of
those
given
situations.
that's
why
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
conduct
and
the
post-'91
trial
conduct,
it's
apparent
at
this
point
that
there
is
a
reasonable
ground
of
bias.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
in
part,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
pervasive
bias
exception
to
455(a).
the
pervasive
bias
exception
only
comes
up
when
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
used
their
inherent
authority
to
remove
a
judge.
the
perfect
example
of
this
is,
1)
if
you
look
at
the
language
that
has
just
been
used,
the
language
in
the
statute
is
"might",
that
is,
whether
there's
an
appearance
of
bias.
the
language
in
the
statute
is
not
455(a).
as
further
proof
of
the--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--"might
reasonably",
but--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--but
if
it's
only
"might",
your
honor,
what
it
would...
what
"might"
means
is
an
appearance
of
bias,
not
a
pervasive
bias,
so
the
standards
are
totally
different.
455(a)
doesn't
even
require
bias,
it
requires
an
appearance
of
bias,
and
if
you
have
pervasive
bias,
it's
beyond
bias.
i
mean,
it's
an
extremely
egregious
situation.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
i
agree.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
it's
not
a
valid
interpretation
of
the
language,
and
you
can
see
it
in
the
jacobs
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
in
that
case,
the
judge
was
supposedly
guilty
of
pervasive
bias.
they
dismissed
an
indictment
against
the
government
and
did
some
other
things.
it
went
up
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
candidly
admitted,
if
this
case
were
here
under
455(a),
we
couldn't
remove
the
judge
because
of
our
extrajudicial
source
requirement.
the
judge
did
all
of
this
in
the
courtroom,
just
as
the
hypotheticals
we've
been
talking
about
this
morning.
therefore,
since
455(a)
wouldn't
require
removal,
we
can
do
it,
however,
under
our
inherent
authority
of
the
court,
and
that's
where
pervasive
bias
comes
in.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
455(a).
it
comes
in
out
of
offutt
and
the
other
cases
from
this
court
and
from
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal,
where
they
have
said,
if
things
get
so
out
of
control,
we
can
remove
a
judge,
just
as
judge
elliott
was
removed
a
few
months
ago
by
the
eleventh
circuit.
they
don't
have
the
455(a)
determination
about
in-court
conduct,
and
they
removed
him
for
harsh
language
back
toward
the
eleventh
circuit
in
clark
v.
coats
&
clark.
they
are
two
totally
separate
things,
and
there's
no
pervasive
bias
exception.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
that
was
on
direct...
that
was
on
a
third
appeal.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
the
second...
mr.
hungar
says
it's
only
common
sense,
this
argument
he
makes
about
what
is
in
court
and
what
is
out
of
court,
and
how
we
should
judge
judges.
it
seems
to
me
what
common
sense
is
is
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
makes
no
sense,
because
the
way
we
know
our
judges
is
in
the
courtroom
and
by
their
judging,
not
by
their
off-bench
conduct,
so
what
makes
common
sense
is
to
apply
the
statute
the
way
it
is
written.
thirdly,
he
said
in
1974
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
law,
and
therefore,
since
we
want
to
drop
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement
under
455(a),
we
have
the
burden.
455(a),
may
it
please
the
court,
was
an
entirely
new
proposition
in
1974.
before
that
455(a)
only
talked
about
conflicts
of
interest.
455(b)
expanded
that,
and
then
455(a)
was
a
completely
new
proposition
of
law,
which
set
up
for
the
first
time
appearance
of
bias
as
the
proper
standard.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
it
does.
it
does,
because
it
says
"any
justice,
judge,
or
magistrate.
"
next,
there
was
a
question...
i
think
it
was
by
justice
o'connor.
the
eleventh
circuit,
based
on
their
decision,
and
judge
elliott
based
on
his
decision,
never
read
the
transcript
and
never
had
to
look
at
1983.
that's
what's
fundamentally
unfair
about
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement,
because
the
confidence
in
the
judiciary
is
going
to
be
diminished
if
someone
makes
allegations,
whether
they're
right
or
wrong,
about
what
happened
in
'83
and
the
judges
say,
we
are
going
to
hide
behind
extrajudicial
source
requirement,
we
are
going
to
dodge
the
allegations,
and
we
don't
have
to
read
the
transcript.
that--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--given
the
pervasive
bias
argument
he
made,
only
the
'91
transcript,
your
honor,
because
the
'83
conviction
wasn't
on
appeal.
finally,
i
think--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--excuse
me.
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor,
and
no
one
has
ever
read
that
transcript.
finally,
i
think
justice
kennedy's--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--if
it's--
[laughter]
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
if
i
had
said
it
was
really
bad--
mr.
peter
j.
thompson
--i
said
verbally
it
was
really
bad,
but
455(a)
doesn't
say
that
i
should
say
it's
really
bad.
[laughter]
