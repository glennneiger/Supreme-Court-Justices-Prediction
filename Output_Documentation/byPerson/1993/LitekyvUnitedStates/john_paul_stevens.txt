justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
one
question.
there's
some
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
the
actual
alleged
misconduct
of
the
judge
in
this
case.
what,
in
your
view,
is
the
most
serious
transgression
that
the
trial
judge
made
here
indicating
a
lack
of
impartiality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
take
your
pick.
the
reason
i'm
asking
the
question
is,
i
think
perhaps
if
we
reached
the
merits
we
would
not
be
as
offended
by
the
trial
judge's
conduct
as
you
suggest
in
you
briefs,
and
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i've
focused
on
what
you
think
the
most
egregious
misconduct
of
the
judge
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my
question
is,
which
of
the
ten
do
you
think
is
the
worst?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
rely
on
the
principle
of
synergism.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
this,
because
the...
as
i
understand
your
argument,
the
pervasive
bias
exception
is
something
that
developed
80
years
ago,
so
it's
an
exception
to
a
rule
that
was
superseded
by
455(a).
i
don't
know
quite
how
you
can
assume
that
if
the
rule
itself
has
been
changed,
that
some
exception
to
a
different
rule
would
necessarily
survive
under
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
455(a)
is
a
new
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
a
recusal
for
appearance
of...
where
it's
partiality
might
reasonably
be
questioned.
isn't
that
an
appearance
of
bias
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
in
your
opposition
say
that
the
judge
didn't
abuse
his
discretion
in
finding
he
was
not
biased.
you
said,
it's
not
up
to
the
judge,
but
your
brief
argues
that
he
didn't
abuse
his
discretion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
all
candor,
i
haven't
read
the
pervasive
bias
exception
cases.
are
there
more
than
one
after
the
455(a)
was
adopted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
sort
of
a
leading
case
you
can
point
to
on
the
pervasive
bias
exception
as
applied
to
455(a)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you...
let
me...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
would
it
have
been
correct
procedure
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
to
have
looked
at
the
papers
and
said,
everything
he
alleges
is
something
that
happened
in
either
this
case
or
the
1983
case.
we
don't
have
to
look
at
that.
we'll
just
affirm.
would
that
have
been
a
sufficient
discharge
of
the
judicial
duties
of
the
circuit
judges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is,
we
don't
even
have
to
read
it
on
the
basis
of
the
submission
here,
because
it's
all
in
the
proceeding,
and
there's
no
allegation
of
pervasive
bias.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
what
if
the
judge
said,
i've
tried
100
narcotics
cases
involving
hispanic
defendants,
and
they're
all
liars,
i'm
convinced
of
that,
and
i
therefore
conclude
i
don't
like
hispanics.
the
source
of
his
bias
arose
in
a
series
of
cases.
do
you
disqualify
him,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
thinks
he
learned
about
a
characteristic
of
a
class
of
persons
from
trying
a
lot
of
cases
involving
members
of
the
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
source
of
it
is
judicial--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
judicial
proceeding,
and
that's
the
only
time
he
ever
met
a
hispanic,
was
in
the
courtroom.
