we
might
have
done
the
same
thing
here,
if
you
had
given
a
similar
statement.
you
know
better
than
to
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
focus
the
defendant's
attention
on
what
was
going
to
be
determinative
of
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
may
be
there's
a
polite
and
an
impolite
way
to
do
this,
i
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
define
pervasive
bias
as
what
a
reasonable
person
would
ascertain
as
being
biased?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
your
exception
doesn't
mean
that
the
whole
exercise
of
judicial
and
extrajudicial
sources
is
just
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
have
to
go
through
the
exercise
of
reviewing
to
see
whether
there's
persuasive
bias,
why
don't
we
just
say
that
this
is
insufficient
as
a
showing
to
disqualify,
and
the
whole
dichotomy
between
judicial
and
extrajudicial
just
becomes
irrelevant
at
that
point?
i
mean,
your
brief
is
very
candid,
in
which
you
say
that
there
this
exception
when
you
think
it's
necessary,
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
exception
doesn't
really
swallow
the
rationale
for
having
the
distinction
to
begin
with.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
we're
just
saying
that
that's
not
bias.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
the
inquiry
is
to
the
nature
and
the
intensity
of
the
bias,
and
not
its
source.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
a
fair
hypothetical,
because
in
one
case
we
know
that
the
bias
was
proper,
and
in
the
other
case
we
know
that
there's
no
bias
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
so
then
you've
just
given
us
a
hypothetical
in
which
it's
self-answering,
because
there's
no
bias
at
all
in
the
second
hypothetical
under
any
theory.
