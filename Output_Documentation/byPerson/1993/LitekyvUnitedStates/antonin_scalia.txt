justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem...
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
disclosed
this.
the
problem...
what
you're
proposing
is,
it
doesn't
just
open
up
every
prior
trial
that
a
particular
defendant
has
had
before
this
judge.
it
opens
up
any
prior
trial
that
involved
the
same
kind
of
issues.
i
mean,
defense
counsel
could
bring
in
other
trials
involving
protestors
at
fort
benning,
or
other
trials
involving
personal
injury
plaintiffs,
or
whatever.
it
really
gives
enormous
scope
to
disqualification
motions,
and
in
criminal
cases,
especially
where
there's
not
much
to
lose,
i
worry
about
the
amount
of
time
that
judges
are
going
to
have
to
be
spending
in
considering
these
motions.
it's
not
just
that
this
particular
defendant
was
tried
earlier,
it's
that
this
judge
has
shown
that
he
doesn't
like
child
molesters,
or
he
doesn't
like
whatever.
isn't
there
any
way
to
avoid
subjecting
the
judiciary
to
that
enormous
burden?
justice
scalia,
i
don't
suggest
that
there
be
minitrials
in
every
case.
i
don't
suggest
that
the
hypothetical
posed
by
the
chief
justice
be
grounds
under
455(a).
one
response
i
could
make
is
that
the
government
in
this
case
said
virtually
in
every
case
what
this
is
going
to
cause,
open
the
pandora's
box
and
there
will
be
455(a)
motions
ad
nauseam,
and
there
will
be
writs
of
mandamus,
and
in
the
one
circuit
that
has
clearly
rejected
the
extrajudicial
source
requirement,
the
first
circuit,
that
was
done
in
early
1990.
we
cited
in
our
reply
brief
a
lexis
search
and
there
were...
if
you
looked
at
mandamuses
and
455(a)
cases
for
the
last
2-1/2
years
in
the
first
circuit,
there
have
been
zero,
so
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
partial
answer
to
the
question,
but
it
doesn't
appear
that
the
deluge
or
the
problem
is
one
that's
going
to
occur.
the
other
answer
to
the
question
is,
the
court's
very--
--if
you're
representing
a
defendant
who
has
been
before
a
stern
judge
before,
a
judge
that
you
think
you
might
have
a
case
for
saying
there
was
an
appearance
of
bias,
wouldn't
you
be
bound,
as
a
defense
attorney,
to
make
that
recusal
motion?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
once
again,
you're
not
saying
that
if
the
judge
forms
his
opinion
based
on
what's
in
the
case
there's
absolutely
no
basis.
you're
just
saying,
unless
that
opinion
is
so
strong
that
it
amounts
to
pervasive
bias--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
you
give
me
a
definition
of
pervasive
bias,
because
i
really...
i
agree
with
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
see
what's
gained
by
adopting
this
rule
with
this
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
mean
anything
different
than
really
bad
bias?
is
that
what
it
means?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
better
than
pervasive,
because
pervasive
to
me
means
more
than
the
single
comment.
you
acknowledged
to
the
chief
justice
that
one
comment
at
the
end...
you
know,
you
are
a,
whatever
it
was
he
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
thompson
says
that
this
is
an
extreme
case.
i
mean,
he
said
that
before.
he
said,
gee,
you
know,
i've
been
practicing
for
how
many
years,
and
i've
never
brought
a
disqualification
motion
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
get
you
to
say
it
has
to
be
an
extreme
case?
he
says
this
is
an
extreme
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
had
to
say...
he
didn't
say
this
is
an
extreme
case
below,
either?
he
didn't
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hungar,
i
guess
i
really
don't
understand
just
what's...
did
you
say
that
if
the
judge
says
that
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
i'm
going
to
rule
against
you
because
you're
hispanic,
that
does
not
come
within
the
extrajudicial
source?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
an
extrajudicial
source--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
the
statement
is
made
during
the
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
source
of
the
bias,
not
the
source
of
the
statement
that
counts?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
only
discovered
the
man
was
hispanic
at
the
trial.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
never
knew
this
man
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you'd
also
say
there's
no
bias
if
what
the
judge
said
is,
i've
seen
your
right
eye
twitching
during
this
whole
trial,
and
i
conclude
from
that
that
you
are
just
an
incorrigible
liar.
that
would
not
be
bias
either,
right,
because
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a
judicial
source.
he
derived
that
from,
you
know...
this
judge
just
jumps
to
quick
conclusions
on
the
basis
of
minor
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
an
extrajudicial
source.
you
would
acknowledge
that
that's
a
judicial
source.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait...
now
wait.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
says,
on
the
basis
of
what
you
said,
i
conclude
you're
an
incorrigible
liar.
you
say,
well,
that's
a
judicial
source,
but
if
he
says,
on
the
basis
of
my
watching
your
eye
twitch
you're
an
incorrigible
liar,
it
suddenly
becomes
an
extrajudicial
source?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
"might".
it
says,
"might
reasonably".
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
where
they
say
the
pervasive
comes
from...
"might
reasonably"...
and
unless
it's
a
pervasive
bias,
they
say,
it
would
not
reasonably.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
think
what
they're
saying
is,
look,
when
you've
just
sat
through
3
days
of
trial
in
an
odious
torture
and
homicide
case,
one
would
expect
you
to
come
out
of
it
with
a
fairly...
assuming
the
person's
convicted,
with
a
fairly
poor
opinion
of
this
person,
and
that
has
to...
and
that
would
be
expected
to
be
shown
in
the
judge's
comments
at
sentencing
and
perhaps
during
trial,
but
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not...
that
is
not
unreasonable,
but
it's
only
when
it
becomes
unreasonable.
i
mean,
he
flies
into
a
towering
rage,
or
something.
then,
at
that
point,
it
doesn't
come
within
455(a).
why
isn't
that
a
perfectly
valid
interpretation
of
the
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
say...
i
think
they
say
that
they
would
have
read
it
if
you
had
said
this
was
really
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
the
government's
position.
they
would
have
read
it
if...
you
just
didn't
say
it
was
really
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
not
say
it
was
really
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
before
enduring
the
petitioner's
1991
trial
on
federal
criminal
charges,
the
district
judge
denied
defense
motions
that
he
recuse
himself
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
section
455(a)
which
requires
a
federal
judge
to
'disqualify
himself
in
any
proceeding
in
which
his
impartiality
might
reasonably
be
questioned".
the
first
motion
of
the
two
motions
to
disqualify
was
based
on
rulings
and
statements
the
same
judge
had
made
which
allegedly
displayed
impatience,
disregard,
and
animosity
towards
the
defense
at
one
of
the
petitioner's
bench
trial
on
similar
charges
eight
years
earlier
in
1983.
the
second
motion
was
based
on
the
judge's
admonishment
of
one
of
the
petitioner's
counsel
and
co-defendants
in
front
of
the
jury
at
the
1991
trial
itself.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
convictions
agreeing
with
the
district
judge
that
matters
are
rising
from
judicial
proceedings
are
not
a
proper
basis
for
recusal.
in
a
decision
announced
today,
we
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit
and
hold
that
required
recusal
under
section
455(a)
is
subject
to
the
limitation
that
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
extrajudicial
source
doctrine.
the
extrajudicial
source
doctrine
predates
to
current
section
455.
it
was
originally
developed
under
section
144
of
title
28
which
requires
disqualification
for
"personal
bias
or
prejudice".
that
phrase
is
repeated
in
section
455
but
not
in
subsection
(a).
it
is
contained
in
section
455(b)(1).
the
textural
basis
for
the
doctrine,
the
extrajudicial
source
doctrine
is,
we
believe,
the
pejorative
connotation
of
the
words
bias
or
prejudice
which
indicate
a
judicial
predisposition
that
is
wrongful
or
inappropriate.
because
the
term
partiality
in
section
455(a)
similarly
refers
only
to
such
favoritism
as
is
for
some
reason
wrongful
or
inappropriate,
section
455(a)'s
requirement
of
recusal
whenever
there
exist
genuine
question
concerning
the
judge's
impartiality
does
not
preclude
application
of
the
extrajudicial
source
doctrine.
to
think
otherwise
would
cause
section
455
in
a
significant
sense
to
contradict
itself
since,
as
petitioners
acknowledged,
subsection
(b)(1)
embodies
the
doctrine
and
subsection
(a)
duplicates
subsection
(b)'s
protection
with
regard
to
bias
and
prejudice.
it
is,
however,
preferable
to
speak
of
the
existence
of
an
extrajudicial
source
factor
rather
than
of
a
doctrine
because
the
presence
of
such
a
source
does
not
necessarily
establish
bias
and
its
absence
does
not
necessarily
preclude
bias.
from
our
decision
today,
two
consequences
flow:
first,
judicial
rulings
alone
almost
never
constitute
valid
basis
for
a
bias
or
partiality
recusal
motion.
apart
from
surrounding
comments
or
accompanying
opinion
rulings
alone
cannot
possibly
show
reliance
on
an
extrajudicial
source,
and
absent
such
reliance,
they
require
recusal
only
when
the
evidence
such
deep-seated
favoritism
or
antagonism
as
would
make
fair
judgment
impossible.
secondly,
opinions
formed
by
the
judge
on
the
basis
of
facts
introduced
or
events
occurring
during
current
or
prior
proceedings
are
not
grounds
for
a
recusal
motion
unless
they
display
a
similar
degree
of
favoritism
or
antagonism.
applying
these
principles
to
the
present
case,
we
find
that
none
of
the
grounds
petitioners
assert
required
disqualification.
they
consist
of
judicial
rulings,
routine
trial,
administration
efforts,
and
ordinary
admonishments
to
counsel
and
to
witnesses,
all
occurred
in
the
course
of
judicial
proceedings
and
neither,
one,
relied
upon
knowledge
acquired
outside
such
proceedings
nor,
two,
displayed
deep-seated,
and
unequivocal
antagonism
that
would
render
fair
judgment
impossible.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
blackmun,
stevens,
and
souter
have
joined.
