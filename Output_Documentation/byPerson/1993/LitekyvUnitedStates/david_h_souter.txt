justice
david
h.
souter
and,
of
course,
we
could
construe
subsection
(a)
entirely
consistently
with
what
you
have
just
said--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
still
come
out
your
way,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
(b)(1)
refers
to
personal
bias
and
(a)
does
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
that
assume
the
question
before
us?
you're
saying
it
was
aimed
at
only
one
issue,
and
there
is
a
textual
argument
to
the
effect...
by
omitting
any
reference
to
personal
there's
a
textual
argument
that
it
was
aimed
at
two.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
all
it
had
wanted
to
do,
wouldn't
it
have
been
easier
to
amend
144,
because
144
does
have
a
textual
basis
for
the
gloss
that
was
put
on
it,
because
it
refers
to
personal
bias
or
prejudice,
which
is
a
textual
basis
for
the
extrajudicial
source
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
an
easy
way
to
get
where
we
all
seem
to
be
agreeing
we
should
end
up,
simply
to
say
that
subsection
(a)
does
not
contain
the
limitation
that
you
say
it
contains,
and
construe
it
simply
to
require
a
very
serious,
a
very
bad
degree
of
bias
before
it
comes
into
play?
your
way
of
getting
to
the
point
where
everybody
seems
to
say
we
should
get
is
to
say
that
there
is
an
extratextual
exception
to
a
requirement
which
is
itself
not
textual
in
subsection
(a).
why
isn't
it
easier
to
say
that
yes,
subsection
(a)
can
by
its
terms
include
the
judicially
derived
bias,
but
it's
got
to
be
very
serious?
