justice
ruth
bader

mr.
thompson,
was
there
an
appeal
in
the...
in
the
1983
case,
was
there
any
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
some
concern
here
that
the
recusal
motion
is
being
used
to
substitute
for,
to
do
service
for
an
appeal
objecting
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial
in
1983?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
in
allowing
a
litigant
to
rely
on
conduct
in
a
prior
trial
when
that
judgment
wasn't
appealed,
allow
that
many
years
later
to
come
up
in
the
guise
of
a
recusal
motion,
is...
perhaps
that's
the
reason
why
courts
have
said
they're
not
going
to
entertain
what
might
be
regarded
as
a
substitute
for
an
appeal
in
this
form.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
some
overlap
between
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
because
the
things
that
you...
if
you
have
a
biased
judge,
certainly
you
don't
have
a
fair
trial,
and
so
you
are
asking
this
judge
to
go
over
making
this
decision,
the
record
of
an
old
trial,
in
somewhat
of
the
manner
that
a
court
of
appeals
would
review
it
to
determine
if
the
trial
had
been
fair.
it
may...
i
agree
with
you
that
they're
not
identical,
but
there
is
a
considerable
overlap.
what...
you're
asking
this
trial
judge
to
kind
of
sit
in
judgment
on
his
own
performance,
some
similarity
to
what
a
court
of
appeals
would
have
done
if
you
had
appealed
the
original
conviction
and
said
i
didn't
get
a
fair
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
have
to
be
the
appearance,
because
a
judge
takes
an
oath
to
administer
justice
without
respect
to
persons.
if
a
judge
couldn't
do
that,
the
judge
would
be
duty-bound
to
recuse,
so
what
you're
suggesting
is,
although
the
judge
knows
she
isn't
biased,
that
he's
supposed
to
read
an
old
transcript
to
determine
whether
somebody,
some
reasonable
viewer
might
think
she
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
shouldn't
it
be...
haven't
you
made
a
point
that
doesn't
work
in
your
favor?
why
shouldn't
the
authority
be
at
that
level,
rather
than
asking
trial
judges
to
sit
in
judgment
on
themselves
and
review
old
transcripts,
the
kind
of
authority
that
you're
talking
about
generally
would
occur
on
an
appeal,
where
there's
a
remand
with
instructions
to
have
the
case
retried
before
another
judge?
so
i
suppose
contemporaneous,
not
10
years
later,
and
it's
by
a
reviewing
authority
rather
than
the
judge
in
the
first
instance
herself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hungar,
you
just
said,
generally.
that's
not
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
read
the
sentence
in
the
opinion
we're
reviewing,
"but
matters
arising
out
of
the
course
of
judicial
proceedings
are
not
a
proper
basis
for
recusal.
"
as
implicitly
to
contain
the
qualification,
"except
in
extraordinary
cases".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
take
it
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
you
do
not
read
this
as
an
ironclad
rule
without
any
exception?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
position
essentially
that
the
statute
is
silent,
but
there
is...
there
was
a
background
jurisprudence,
and
congress
is
taken
to
have
allowed
that...
to
either
have
incorporated
it
or
allowed
it
to
stay
undisturbed,
so
you
don't
get
it
out
of
the
statute,
except
that
the
statute
doesn't
overturn
what
has
been
the
doctrine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
notice
in
your
brief
there
was
some
discomfort
that
you
had
with
pervasive
bias
that
you
get
out
of
a
fifth
circuit
decision
which
you
credit
for
it.
you
put
that
in
a
footnote.
your
own
term
is,
"except
in
extreme
cases",
so
maybe
instead
of
trying
to
define
pervasive
bias,
the
term
you've
used
as
a
synonym
is
"extreme
cases",
so
could
you
give
us
an
extreme
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
have
preferred
that
they
characterized
it
as
an
extreme
case,
instead
of
saying
pervasive
bias
existed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
might
have
an
extreme
case
that
is
not
one
where
the
bias
has
been...
pervasive
has
the
idea
throughout,
and
you
could
have
an
extreme
case
based
on
one
remark.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
was
a
racial
epithet,
for
example.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hungar,
the
cases
speak
in
terms
of
in-court
conduct.
in-court
conduct
is
what's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
on
direct
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
they
have
to
read
the
transcript
as
long
as
the
doctrine
comes
with
the
exception
for
extreme
cases,
read
the
transcript
to
see
if
this
is
an
extreme
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
comment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
don't
understand
at
all,
because
i
thought
one
of
the
reasons...
one
of
the
ways
you
were
establishing
that
this
judge
gave
at
least
the
appearance
of
bias
was
based
on
the
encounters
at
the
1983
trial.
