justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
challenge
here
was
brought
under
455(a),
is
that
correct,
not
under
any
of
the
provisions
of
455(b)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
you
think
that
the
facts
here
as
you
allege
them
to
be
would
also
be
sufficient
to
amount
to
something
that
could
be
challenged
under
455(b)(1),
which
is
the
personal
bias
or
prejudice
concerning
a
party?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
accept
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--requirement
under
(b)(1)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you're
trying
to
fit
this
under
the
whether
the
impartiality
might
reasonably
be
questioned
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
is
a
little
hard
to
real
all
that
into
the
language
of
455(a),
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
it's
hard
to
read
into
it
a
pervasiveness
requirement.
i
mean,
the
language
just
speaks
of
reasonable
appearances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
does
that
apply
to
this
court
as
well,
the
members
of
this
court?
