mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
prisoner
who
wants
to
bring
a
section
1983
damages
action
in
federal
court
challenging
assorted
constitutional
violations
that
took
place
during
the
course
of
a
criminal
investigation
must
first
exhaust
state
postconviction
remedies.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
is
focused
on
acts
that
took
place
during
the
course
of
the
investigation
leading
up
to
the
trial,
so
it
does
not
focus
on
any
particular
trial
event.
it
doesn't
focus
on
the
introduction
of
evidence,
for
example.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
it
quite
clearly
would
not
vitiate
the
judgment
of
conviction
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
part
of
the
problem
in
this
case,
and
one
of
the
fundamental
questions
in
this
case,
involves
the
court
of
appeals
test,
which
is
does
a
damages
claim
involve
an
attack
on
the
validity
of
the
conviction.
and
we
think
that
that
question
is
simply
not
meaningful
in
a
case
like
this.
petitioner,
and
prisoners
in
his
situation,
are
not
attacking
the
validity
of
their
convictions.
they're
attacking
particular
constitutional
violations
that
they
assert
occurred
at
the
hands
of
particular
individual
defendants.
and
there
is
nothing,
necessarily,
about
such
a
challenge
that
calls
into
question
the
validity
of
the
conviction
in
any
sense,
because--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--one
claim
that's
made
in
this
case
is
that
exculpatory
evidence
or
potentially
exculpatory
evidence
was
destroyed
by
law
enforcement
investigators.
it's
possible
that
that
occurred...
that
could
have
been
a
constitutional
violation.
it
could
be
remediable
on
any
number
of
theories,
and
yet
it
could
have
been
harmless
error
at
the
trial.
it
may
have
had
no
affect
on
his
conviction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
in
which
a
damages
claim
can
proceed,
apart
from
the
use
of
the
evidence
of
trial.
prisoner
could
simply
be
asking
for
nominal
damages
for
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
right.
he
could
be
asking
for
punitive
damages
because
of
reckless
disregard
of
constitutional
rights
by
particular
law
enforcement
officers.
there
could
be
a
whole
host
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--there
are,
i
suppose,
two
types
of
other
damages
that
could
be
involved,
justice
souter.
one
is
the
one
that
you're
suggesting.
another,
just
to
mention
it,
is
the
sort
of
ancillary
damages
that
you
and
justice
ginsburg
discussed
in
your
separate
opinions
recently
in
albright
v.
oliver,
the
kind
of
reputational
injury
or
other
kinds
of
sort
of
direct
injuries
that
are
unrelated
to
the
condition.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
they
could
claim
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
there
are
several
observations,
i
think,
to
make
in
response
to
that.
it
is
true
that
that
particular
aspect
of
the
prisoner's
claim,
and
only
that
aspect
of
the
prisoner's
claim,
in
a
sense
turns
on
sort
of
a
but-for
question:
would
the
conviction
have
occurred
but
for
the
constitutional
violation?
but
even
answering
that
question
in
the
affirmative
and
saying
that
the
prisoner
would
not
have
been
convicted
had
the
constitutional
violation
not
occurred
does
not,
in
any
sense,
sort
void
the
conviction
or
say
that
it
is
voidable
now.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that
would
be
a
practical
decision
that
the
state
would
have
to
make,
your
honor,
but
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
exhaustion
is
required,
which
is
the
question
here,
i
think
that
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
principles
that
are
served,
the
policies
that
are
served
by
the
habeas
exhaustion
requirement.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think,
your
honor...
and,
first
of
all,
that
argument
has
not
been
suggested
at
any
point
during
the
course
of
this
litigation,
but
i
think,
in
any
event,
that
suggestion
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
claim.
all
that
we're
concerned
with
here
is
whether
or
not
a
1983
action
can
be
brought,
whether
this
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
action.
it
may
be--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me
give
you
two
responses
to
that,
justice
kennedy.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
is
a
question
relating
to
the
merits.
and
it
may
be
that,
on
remand,
that
aspect
and
only
that
aspect
of
the
petitioner's
claim
could
be
dismissed
on
such
a
theory
which,
as
i
say,
has
not
been
propounded
at
any
point
during
the
course
of
the
litigation
now.
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
concern
itself
with
that.
it
needs
to
concern
itself
only
with
whether
the
action
can
proceed
to
a
disposition
on
the
merits.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
i
understand
that
suggestion,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think,
first
of
all,
there
are
other
claims
which
are
presented
in
this
case,
claims
for...
as
we
read
the
complaint,
and
it
is
a
pro
se
complaint
which
is
not
written
artfully,
but
as
we
understand
it,
it
asks
for
nominal
damages
and
punitive
damages,
as
well
as
this
aspect
of
compensatory
damages.
in
addition,
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
issue
preclusion
or
claim
preclusion,
which
is
what
i
think
your
question
goes
to,
it
is
not
the
case
that
a
petitioner...
even
a
petitioner
asking
for
these
kinds
of
consequential
damages
is
attacking
the
validity
of
his
conviction
or
calling
the
validity
of
the
judgment
into
question.
petitioner...
it
may
be
that
if
a
claim
has
been
adjudicated
in
the
course
of
the
return
of
the
conviction,
that
that
question
has
been
adjudicated
and
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
issue
preclusion
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
it
was
not
adjudicated,
your
honor,
the
question
would
be
one
of
collateral
estoppel
rather
than
res
judicata
or
the
new
more
fashionable
terminology
of
issue
preclusion
rather
than
claim
preclusion,
because
there
are
actually
different
parties
involved
in
the
litigation.
the
state,
of
course,
was
involved
in
the
criminal
conviction.
this
action
is
brought
against
individual
named
defendants
acting
in
their
individual
capacities.
and,
in
addition,
there
are
different
claims
involved.
obviously,
the
state's
claim
involved
its
criminal
prosecution--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
could
have
been
raised
at
trial,
your
honor,
that's
true,
but
if
the
question
is
one
of
issue
preclusion,
the
rule
to
be
followed
is...
in
a
case
like
this,
because
it's
a
state
judgment
which
is
at
issue,
one
would
look
to
the
preclusion
law
of
the
state.
and
indiana's
preclusion
law
provides
that
an
issue
that
could
have
been
raised
but
was
not
raised
is
not
precluded
in
subsequent
litigation,
and
therefore
it
would
be
open
to
review.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
state
of
indiana
was,
of
course,
the
party
adverse
to
petitioner
in
the
criminal
case.
petitioner
has
not
sued
the
state
of
indiana,
and
couldn't
sue
the
state
of
indiana,
which
is
not
a
person
under
section
1983.
he
has
sued
individual
state
officers
acting
in
their
individual
capacities.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
this
is
an
issue
which
is
debated
in
the
briefs,
your
honor.
we
think
it
is
reasonably
clear
that
they
would
not
be
treated
as
the
same
parties
for
purposes
of
issue
preclusion.
as
a
matter
of
black
letter
law--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--let
me
give
you
several
answers
to
that
question,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--oh,
excuse
me,
justice
ginsburg.
i'm
sort
used
to
looking
at
the
other
end
of
the
court,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
as
a
black
letter
rule,
individual
parties
sued
in
their
individual
capacities
and
parties
sued
in
their
official
capacities
are
treated
as
distinct.
as
to
the
question
you
raise
specifically,
the
court
has
set
out...
has
considered
this
question
in
the
case
of
montana
v.
united
states
and
has
listed
a
number
of
factors
that
could
come
into
play
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
party
that
in
some
sense
sponsors
the
litigation
or
pays
for
the
litigation
is
deemed
to
be,
to
use
the
old
terminology,
in
privity
with
the
party
who
is
actually
facing
judgment
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
in
control
of
the
litigation
is
one
of
the
factors
that
the
court
has
indicated
is
relevant.
i
think
as
to
whether
or
not
a
court
is
likely
to
find
collateral
estoppel
in
such
a
case,
or
to
cite
the
court
to
sherlock
holmes
and
the
dog
that
didn't
bark,
there
has
never
been
such
a
case
that
either
the
state
of
indiana
or
that
we
have
found,
in
which
an
individual
who
is
sued
in
his
individual
capacity
and
receives
an
adverse
judgment,
that
judgment
is
then
used
to
bind
the
state.
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
certainly,
to
prevail
on
the
merits
the
petitioner
would
have
to
show
that
his
incarceration
is
unlawful
in
the
sense
that
he
would
not
have
been
convicted
but
for
the
happening
of
the
constitutional
violation--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
is,
again,
a
question
that
would
go
to
the
merits
that
would
govern
this
type
of
litigation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
there
are
several
points,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist.
well,
the
court
certainly
can
take
into
account
traditional
notions
of
res
judicata.
the
court
has
already
addressed,
essentially,
an
identical
question
in
preiser
v.
rodriguez
and
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
in
which
prisoners
were
bringing
actions
attempting
to
shorten
their
sentences.
and
the
court
held
quite
clearly
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
and
indicated
quite
expressly
in
preiser
v.
rodriguez
that
if
a
prisoner
is
suing
for
money
damages,
he
can
proceed
immediately
in
federal
courts
while--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
for
purposes
of
the
habeas
policies,
the
court
held
quite
expressly
in
preiser--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
the
court
did
hold
in
preiser
that...
in
response
to
the
argument
that
actually
had
been
made
by
the
prisoners
in
that
case,
that
habeas
policies
were
concerned
only
with
judgments
of
conviction
rather
than
with
the
length
of
a
sentence,
that
both
concerns
were
equally
close
to
what
the
court
called
the
core
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
that
was
the
basis
for
the
court's
conclusion
that
exhaustion
was
necessary,
in
preiser.
applying
that
same
conclusion
here
and
determining
whether
or
not
exhaustion
is
necessary
here,
the
court's
conclusion
there
that
a
damages
action
could
proceed
simultaneously
with
a
state
action
asking
for
earlier
release,
i
think
is
dispositive
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
don't
think
that's
quite
true,
justice
o'connor.
there--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
court
reserved
the
question
in
tower,
your
honor,
and
said
it
had...
didn't
have
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
subject,
which
was
quite
clearly
true
in
tower.
the
court
in
tower
did
not
cite
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
which
is
a
case
which
we
think
is
actually
dispositive
here,
and
i
think
clearly
cannot
be
read
as
a
sub
silentio
overruling
of
wolff
v.
mcdonnell.
as
to
the
question
of
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
done,
i
think
at
least
one
court
of
appeals
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
in
the
petition...
it's
a
case
called
mack
v.
varelas,
a
relatively
recent
second
circuit
decision
which
has,
we
think,
indicated
that
petitioners
need
not
exhaust
their
damages
action
in
a
case
such
as
this.
there
actually
was
a
second
circuit
case
called
ray
v.
fritz
which
the
court
cited
to
in
preiser
as
a
illustration
of
the
type
of
damages
action
that
it
thought
could
proceed,
which
also
involved
a
claim
by
prisoners
who
were
seeking
earlier
release
and
i
think
indicates
clearly
what
the
court
had
in
mind
in
saying
that
when
a
prisoner
means
to
pursue
a
damages
action,
that
does
not
call
into
question...
that
is
not
going
to
lead
to
his
earlier
release.
he
cannot
do
that.
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--as
you
indicate,
justice
souter,
it
would
turn
on
the
content
of
the
state
postconviction
rules.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
clearly,
in
this
case
the
seventh
circuit
thought
that
there
was
a
postconviction
proceeding
that
could
provide
relief
of
some
sort
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
in
many
cases
it
will
certainly
be
true
that
a
prisoner
is
not
going
to
have
any
additional
avenue
available
beyond
that
that's
presented
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
probably
is
the
general
rule.
now,
most
state
rules
have
exceptions
for
what
they
call
cases
involving
fundamental
unfairness,
and
i
think
that
what
this
suggests
is
that
our
rule
is...
as
a
matter
of
judicial
administration,
is
a
much
simpler
matter,
because
the
state...
the
federal
court
presented
with
a
damages
action
is
not
going
to
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
state
proceeding
available.
it
can
simply
adjudicate
the
1983
claim
on
the
merits.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
seventh
circuit
didn't
identify
what
it
had
in
mind.
we
presume
that
it
had
in
mind
indiana's
postconviction
remedy
statute,
which,
as
justice
souter
suggests
is
true
in
most
cases,
would
have,
as
a
general
matter,
require
a
prisoner
to
raise...
would
bar
a
prisoner
from
raising
in
postconviction
proceedings,
a
claim
that
either
he
had
raised
in
his
direct
appeal
or
a
claim
that
he
could
have
raised
but
did
not
raise.
but
there
is
an
exception
in
that
indiana
statute
for
claims
going
to
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
proceeding,
and
it
may
be
that
the
seventh
circuit
had
that
in
mind.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
certainly
would
be
true
in
most
cases,
because
whenever
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation,
there
will
be
at
least
nominal
damages
available
as
a
remedy.
but
the
fact
is,
there
is
always
going
to
have
to
be
a
set
of
proceedings,
because
the
state
proceedings
do
not
provide
for
damages,
state
postconviction
remedies,
and
federal...
and
the
section
1983
proceeding,
of
course,
concededly
does
not
provide
for
release.
so
there
was
always
going
to
have
to
be
a
set
of
postconviction--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
would
permit
a
prisoner
to
go
immediately
into
federal
court.
i
suggest
that's
not
a
change
so
far
as
this
court's
jurisprudence
is
concerned
because,
as
i
said,
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
and
in
preiser
v.
rodriguez,
this
court
indicated
quite
clearly
that
a
prisoner
damages
action
can
proceed
immediately,
simultaneously
with
the
prisoner's
postconviction
relief
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
i
mean,
the
court,
it
said...
and
this
is
the
court's
language
from
preiser,
that
if
a
prisoner
is
seeking
damages,
he
is
not
asking
for
immediate
or
early
release,
and
he
is
not
attacking
the
length
of
his
sentence
or
the
validity
of
his
sentence.
and
in
such
a
case,
damages
are
not
an
appropriate
or
available
remedy
in
habeas.
that
was
the
rationale
for
the
court's
conclusion
in
preiser,
which
was
applied
in
wolff,
that
exhaustion
is
not
necessary
in
damages
claims.
and
there
is
a
logical--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
but,
again,
tower
simply
indicated
that
the
court
was
not
going
to
express
an
opinion
on
that,
and
tower
did
not
cite
to
wolff,
which
we
think
is
a
clear
holding
of
this
court
that
damages
actions
can
proceed...
damages
actions
that
involve
the
validity
of
procedures
used
to
establish
the
length
of
a
sentence,
those
actions
can
proceed
simultaneously
with
an
action
in
state
court.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
in
terms...
the
question
should
be
separated
into
two
parts,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
has
decided,
as
i've
said,
that
actions
that
can
proceed
in
habeas...
clearly
the
actions
in
preiser
and
in
wolff
could
proceed
in
habeas
so
far
as
the
length
of
the
sentence
was
concerned,
could
proceed
immediately
and
simultaneously
in
a
federal
damages
action.
it
is
true
that
the
court
has
not
applied
that
directly
in
a
case
involving
challenge...
what
indiana
terms
or
what
respondents
term
a
challenge
to
the
conviction.
but
that,
as
i
think
i've...
we
discussed
earlier,
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that...
i
will
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
that
does
not
take
into
account
the
decision
in
wolff,
which
was
not
cited--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
all
that
tower
does,
your
honor,
is
indicate
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
subject,
which
was
clearly
what
the
court
meant
to
do
in
tower.
the
issue
was
not
presented
in
tower,
not
briefed
in
tower.
and
we
think
that...
indeed,
the
respondents
don't
rely
on
tower.
they
cite
to
tower
for
some
collateral
question
or
issue,
but
don't
say
that
tower
is
dispositive
of
the
question
here
or
that
tower
indicates
a
clear
opinion
of
the
court
on
the
question
here.
i
think
it
does
not.
the
court
simply
says
it's
not
going
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
subject,
and
obviously
the
court
will
have
to
determine
what
it
meant
in
wolff.
but
we
think
it
is
clear
from
the
face
of
the
wolff
opinion
that
the
court
concluded
that
exhaustion
is
not
necessary
in
these
circumstances,
whether
or
not
a
petitioner
can
prevail
on
the
merits
of
his
challenge
which
somehow
implicates
the
conviction.
and,
as
i've
suggested,
i
don't
really
think
the
challenge
here
does
implicate
the
conviction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
correct.
if
he...
well,
if
he
prevails,
obviously,
in
his
1983
action.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
he
loses--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
he
would
have
to...
before
he
could
go
into
federal
habeas,
he
would
have
to
exhaust
his
state
remedies,
if
any
are
available,
and
at
that
point
he
would
go
into
federal
court
and
litigate
the
question.
if
he
has
already
lost
on
these
very
issues,
then
he
will
be
estopped
and
disposing
of
the
habeas
petition
on
the
merits
will
be
a
simple
matter.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
would
think,
your
honor,
if
the
issue
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--in
a
subsequent
habeas.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
in
a
subsequent
federal
habeas
action
he
would,
yes,
but
in
a
subsequent
state
post-conviction
proceeding...
maybe
i...
i
misunderstood
your
question.
he
could
well
be
estopped
in
a
subsequent
state
proceeding.
in
fact--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
he
exhausts
the
state
remedies--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
loses,
i
think
he
would
be
estopped...
and
he
litigates
the
question,
he
would
be
estopped
in
a
subsequent
1983
action.
in
fact,
in
preiser
that
is
the
very
reason
that
the
court
indicated
that
a
1983
action
should
proceed
immediately.
the
prisoners
in
preiser
had
argued
that
if
they
were
obligated
to
exhaust
their
claims
first
in
state
proceedings,
that
if
they
lost
they
would
be
estopped
in
a
subsequent
1983
action.
and
the
court's
response
was
that
may
well
be
true,
but
your
solution
is
to
bring
your
1983
action
now.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
is,
your
honor.
and
if
you...
if--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--you
would
be
subject
to
issue...
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor...
maybe
i've
confused
the
point,
but
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor
is
that
in
the
state
proceeding
you
are
subject
to
issue
preclusion.
if
you
lose...
if
you
bring
your
1983
action
first
and
lose,
the
prisoner
is
then
subject
to
preclusion
in
the
state
subsequent
postconviction
relief
proceeding.
now,
if
the
prisoner
then
goes
back
to
federal
habeas,
the
preclusion
rules
are
different
in
federal
habeas
because,
as
a
general
matter,
preclusion
is
not
a
dcctrine
that's
applied
there.
but
the
prisoner
clearly
would
be
estopped
in
the
1983...
in
the
state
post-conviction
proceeding
if
he
loses
the
1983
action.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i'm
referring,
your
honor,
to
the
nonpreclusive
effect
of
a
state
court
judgment.
whether
or
not
a
1983
judgment,
in
federal
court
in
which
the
prisoner
loses,
could
be
used
to
estop
him
in
a
subsequent
habeas
action
is
a
separate
question,
and
it
may
well
be
that
estoppel's
available
there.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
one
that
has
been
identified
by
justices
scalia
and
stevens
in
some
of
their
questions.
the
fact
is
that
petitioner
in
this
case,
and
petitioners
in
cases
like
this,
are
not
necessarily
attacking
the
validity
of
their
conviction.
respondents
have
focused
entirely
on
the
element
of
petitioner's
claim
which
asks
for
damages
for
the
period
of
his
confinement.
he
also
asks
for
what
we
understand
to
be
nominal
damages
and
for
punitive
damages
which
could
be
awarded
notwithstanding
any
determination
regarding
whether
or
not
that
conviction
was
properly
returned
at
the
time
that
it
was
returned.
and
respondents
don't
really
offer
this
court
any
test
at
all
for
resolving
these
cases.
in
fact,
whenever
a
petitioner...
whenever
a
prisoner
advances
a
claim
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
or
any
sort
of
violation
as
to
which
harmless
error
might
apply,
there
is
no
way
of
determining,
on
the
face
of
that
complaint,
whether
or
not
that
calls
into
question
the
validity
of
the
conviction.
i
mean
judge
coffin
wrote,
i
think,
a
very
thoughtful
opinion
for
the
first
circuit
on
precisely
this
point
in
a
case
called
guerro
v.
mulhearn,
which
is
discussed
in
the
briefs,
in
which
he
noted
that
it's
impossible
to
determine,
without
going
through
the
entire
line
of
analysis,
if
the
search
was
unconstitutional.
did
it
produce
investigative
leads,
did
those
leads
lead
to
the
discovery--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
there's
no
justification
for
that,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
as
a
general
matter,
of
course,
the
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
congress
intended
that
1983
claims
not
be
exhausted.
now,
there's
a
specific
reason
for
the
exception
recognized
for
that
in
preiser.
the
specific
exemption
is
that
the
court
found
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
section
2254(b),
the
federal
habeas
exhaustion
requirement,
applied
when
the
petitioner
actually
filed
what
was
a
habeas
petition,
an
action
seeking
an
injunction
that
would
lead
to
his
release.
the
court
said
that
is
a
habeas
petition
and
you
must
exhaust
under
section
2254.
but
the
court
went
on
to
say...
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
face
of
the
habeas
statute,
that
a
petitioner
who
is
asking
for
something
other
than
release
is
not
filing
a
habeas
claim,
and
as
respondents...
i
think
as
my
colleague
from
indiana
conceded,
they
are
not
saying
that
the
section
2254(b)
exception
applies.
they
are
applying
or
asking
the
court
to
create
a
much
more
far-reaching
comity
exception
to
the
general
1983
rule
that
does
not
provide
for
exhaustion.
the
court
has
never
done
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this.
the
court
has
never
said
that
although
you
can
bring
a
section
1983
action
at
some
point,
you'll
have
to
hold
off
doing
it
now
because
there
are
some
general
state
interests...
which
i
think,
really,
have
not
been
clearly
articulated
for
the
court
as
to
precisely
what
they
are.
the
reason
that
the
court
and
congress
have
required
exhaustion
in
the
habeas
setting
is
that
for
a
federal
court
to
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
an
extraordinarily
intrusive
thing.
it
sets
aside
a
state
judgment,
it
requires
a
state
official
to
take
action
in
an
area
of
considerable
concern
to
the
state,
and
it
short
circuits
the
use
of
state
judicial
proceedings,
post-conviction
proceedings.
none
of
that
is
true
of
a
damages
action.
it
has
no
effect
on--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
also
true,
justice
scalia,
which
is
a
reason
why
habeas
should
be
differentiated
from
section
1983.
the
damages
action
has
none
of
those
consequences.
not
only
does
it
not
call
into
question
the
validity
of
the
conviction;
it
does
not
require
the
state
to
do
anything
other
than
to
pay
the
damages
judgment.
it
does
not
short
circuit
the
use,
as
respondent
suggest,
of
state
postconviction
procedures,
because
the
prisoner
is
still
going
to
have
to
go
into
state
court
if
he
wants
release.
those
are
the
concerns
that
have
motivated
the
court
in
all
the
line
of
habeas
cases
emphasizing
the
importance
of
exhaustion;
none
of
them
are
present
here.
and
that
is
particularly
important
when,
as
i
emphasized,
it
is
the
case
that
for
many
of
these
claims
it's
not
going
to
be
apparent,
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
whether
or
not
the
validity
of
the
conviction
is
in
any
manner
called
into
question.
and
i
think
given
the
force
of
the
1983
no
exhaustion
rule
repeatedly
applied
by
the
court,
that
should
be
dispositive
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg...
and
i'll
get
the
name
right
this
time.
i
think
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
a
plaintiff,
as
a
general
matter,
is
the
master
of
his
claim.
the
court
recognized
that
principle
in
this
very
context
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
and
preiser
v.
rodriguez,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
retreat
from
it
now.
the
prisoner
who
prevails
in
his
1983
damages
action
is
still
going
to
have
to
go
into
state
court.
he
is
most
definitely
and
emphatically
not
short
circuiting
the
state
postconviction
process.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
since
we
think
that
there
would
not
be
any
such
preclusion,
i
think
that
that
would
be
fine
with
the
prisoner.
thank
you
very
much.
