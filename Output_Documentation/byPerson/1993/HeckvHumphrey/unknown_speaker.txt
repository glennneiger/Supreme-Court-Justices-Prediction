unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
if
i
may,
mr.
rothfeld,
about
the
theory
under
which
your
case
was
brought
under
1983.
did
it
involve...
did
it
claim
that
things
which
happened
at
the
respondent's...
or
the
petitioner's
trial
violated
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
logical
to
say
that
if
your
client
were
to
win
his
case,
that
still
would
not,
under
some
sort
of
collateral
estoppel
doctrine,
vitiate
the
judgment
of
conviction?
unknown
speaker
is
this--
--what
would
be
an
example
of
one
of
their
claims,
and
the
constitutional
basis
for
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
really
does
have
a
bearing
on
the
trial,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
be
claiming
the
destruction
of
evidence
if
you
weren't
interested
in
that
evidence
being
used
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
could
it
be
asking
for
consequential
damages
for
false
imprisonment?
unknown
speaker
wrongful
imprisonment?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
just
stick
to
the
first
category.
could
they
claim
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
did
claim
them,
then
it
really
would
go
to
the
heart
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
imprisonment
and
conviction.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
in...
if
that's
the...
if
the
answer
turns
out
to
be
that
there
would
have
been
no
conviction
and
there
is
being
a
claim...
and
a
claim
is
being
made
for
consequential
damages,
then
the
state,
in
that
case,
is
faced
with
the
possibility
of
sitting
back
and
doing
nothing
and
letting
the
damages
pile
up
or
letting
the
person
go.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
if
the
damages
amount
to
anything
in
substance,
the
state
is
going
to
say
we'd
better
get
this
guy
out
of
here
before
he
costs
us
any
more
money.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rothfeld,
what
about
just
looking
to
normal
tort
principles.
this
is
an
old
federal
tort
statute.
i
assume
it
incorporates
normal
tort
principles
such
as
causality.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
standard
requirements,
if
you're
bringing
a
cause
of
action
which
depends
upon
the
unlawfulness
of
a
conviction,
is
that
the
conviction
have
been
set
aside.
you
cannot
bring
a
tort
action
for
malicious
prosecution,
for
example,
unless
you've
been
acquitted.
why
should
you
be
able
to
bring
this
tort
action
for
those
constitutional
violations
that
hinge
upon
innocence
without
first
getting
the
conviction
set
aside
or
having
been
declared
innocent?
i
mean,
other
violations,
for
example
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
i
suppose
you
can
sue
on,
no
matter
what,
but
your
damages
from
being
unlawfully
detained,
you're
entitled
to
them
only
if
you're
unlawfully
convicted.
and
why
shouldn't
we
apply
normal
tort
principles
saying
you're
not...
you're
considered
to
be
lawfully
convicted
unless
and
until
that's
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
that's
just
normal
tort
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
goes...
but
it
goes
also
to
just
standard
questions
of
respect
for
the
validity
of
outstanding
judgments.
you
have
a
judgment
here
that
is
deemed
correct
and
it
has
not
been
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you're
contending
that
you
can
ask
for
damages
for
the
enforcement
of
that
judgment.
and
i
think
the
underlying
concern
is
whether
this
suit
should
just
be
dismissed
on
its
merits
at
the
outset.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
i
suppose
we
do,
when
one
of
the
issues
is
whether
or
not
we
should
stay
this
suit
or
allow
it
to
be
dismissed.
if
most
of
these
cases,
most
of
your
damages
are
going
to
be
foreclosed
by
the
existence
of
the
criminal
judgment,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
very,
very
weak
case
for
saying
that
the
suit
and
this
action
should
remain
in
the
docket
of
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
wasn't
adjudicated
but
could
have
been
adjudicated?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
surely
if
you
claim
that
there
was
a
destruction
of
evidence
by
the
state
and
which
violated
the
constitution,
that
could
have
been
raised
at
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
why
do
you
say
the
parties
are
different
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
so
sure
that
that
wouldn't...
that
that
wouldn't
be
treated
as
the
same
parties,
for
issue
preclusion?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
state
is
paying
the
counsel
fees,
providing
counsel.
suppose
the
state
is
providing
counsel
to
the
defendants?
unknown
speaker
ginsburg.
unknown
speaker
in
control
of
the
litigation.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
in
all
the
malicious
prosecution
cases.
the
state
is
not
going
to
be
bound
if
the
individual
officer
loses
for
malicious
prosecution.
nonetheless,
we
don't
allow
the
action
to
proceed.
the
basis
for
not
allowing
it
has
never
been
res
judicata
or
claim
preclusion
or
issue
preclusion;
it's
just
been
you
don't
bring
this
tort
action
until
you've
established
that,
indeed,
your
incarceration
is
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
in
malicious
prosecution
you
don't
get
into
the
courthouse.
you
are
not
allowed
to
show
that
it's
unlawful.
you
go
over
to
the
criminal
side
and
get
it
set
aside,
or
you
win
your
prosecution...
you
win
in
the
criminal
case.
you
can't
come
in
when
you're
in
jail
and
sue
somebody
for
malicious
prosecution,
you
simply
can't,
whether
there's
issue
preclusion,
claim
preclusion,
or
not,
you
can't
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think,
mr.
rothfeld,
you
can
separate...
you
can
have
this
very
narrow
jurisdictional
analysis
that
you're
trying
to
limit
it
to,
as
opposed
to
the
merits.
i
mean,
we've
got
to
be
concerned
with
how
this
affects
traditional
notions
of
res
judicata
and
tort
actions
and
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
neither
of
those
cases
involved
attacks
or
what
could
be
attacks
on
judgments
of
conviction.
unknown
speaker
it
didn't...
it
couldn't
have
held
with
respect
to
judgments
of
convictions
since
those
were
not
involved
in
either
of
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
hasn't
every
court
of
appeals
that's
considered
this
decided
that
the
state
prisoner
cannot
bring
a
section
1983
damages
action
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
conviction,
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
they
seem
to
be
pretty
uniform,
and
i
thought
in
tower
against
glover,
which
i
don't
believe
you
cited,
we
reserved
the
question.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rothfeld,
may
i
leave
theory
for
a
moment
and
ask
you
a
question
about
practical
effect.
is
it
fair
to
say
that
at
least
in
most
states,
the
effect
of
the
exhaustion
rule,
which
is...
which
you
are
protesting,
would
really
simply
require
you
to
complete
the
direct
appeal?
because
i'm
assuming
that
most
states
would
require
a
fourth
amendment
issue
to
be
raised
at
trial
or
before
trial,
and
if
it
were
not,
would
not
allow
it...
would
find
it
barred
or
waived
on
state
habeas,
so
that
as
a
practical...
if
that
is
true
as
a
practical
matter,
would
the
rule
that
you
object
to
in
effect
require
you
to
do
anything
more,
in
practice,
than
simply
complete
the
direct
appeal?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
it'll
be...
won't
that
be
true
in
most
cases?
i
mean,
isn't
that
generally
the
state
rule?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the...
what
was
the
proceeding
in
this
case
that
was
thought
to
be
available
by
the
seventh
circuit?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
that
could
come
up
in
habeas.
i
was
trying
to
think
if
there
was
anything
that
you
couldn't
convert
into
a
1983
damage
claim
that
you
could
bring
for
specific
relief,
let
me
out.
is
it
not
so
that
every
habeas
claim
could
be
stated
alternately
as
a
1983
damage
claim?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're
right,
then
wouldn't
this
make
a
massive
change.
you
could
always...
if
you
would
rather
go
into
federal
court
and
in
damage
format,
you
could
always
do
that,
bypass
any
state
postconviction
remedy,
and
skip
federal
habeas
as
the
first
step.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
rothfeld,
in
tower,
which
justice
o'connor
referred
to,
there
is
an
express
statement
that
we
have
not
decided
this
point
yet,
and
it
also
refers
to
preiser.
i
mean
it's
not
as
if
it
were
written
in
ignorance
of
preiser,
the
tower
statement.
unknown
speaker
so
that
insofar
as
holdings
are
concerned,
we
really
haven't
decided
this
question,
that
is
whether
a
1983
damages
action
which
would
amount
to
a
collateral
challenge
to
judgment
of
conviction
could
proceed?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
agree,
then,
with
the
statement
in
tower
that
we
have
never
decided
whether
1983
could
proceed
without
exhaustion?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn't
you
cite
tower
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roth,
under
your
theory,
if
you
can
proceed
first
in
section
1983
suit
for
damages,
i
assume
the
petitioner
would
not
then
have
any
issue
preclusion
against
him
if
he
subsequently
sought
habeas?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
he
lost
that
1983--
unknown
speaker
--he
can
go
right
into
federal
habeas
and
make
claims
all
over
again,
based
on
the
same
facts,
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
why?
you
think
he's
estopped?
i
wouldn't
have
thought
so.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
were
cases
holding
that
there
isn't
any
issue
preclusion
there.
unknown
speaker
uh-hum.
unknown
speaker
i've
lost
the
exchange
here.
you
were
talking
about
his
being
estopped
after
he
exhausts
and
then
he
comes
back
with
a
1983
action.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
loses.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
it
work
the
other
way,
that
if
you
litigate
and
lose
in
1983
on
the
same
issue,
you
should
lose
it...
i
mean
why
isn't
that
federal
adjudication
just
as
good
as
the
state
adjudication
would
have
been,
if
you--
unknown
speaker
--so
then
you're
changing
the
answer
you
just
gave
to
justice
o'connor
saying
you
would
be
subject
to
issue
preclusion.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
issue
of
preclusion
isn't
applied
in
federal
habeas.
are
you
speaking
of
the
rule
going
back
to
salinger
against
lazlo
where
they
said
that
your
one...
one
habeas
petitioner
dismissal
doesn't
bar
the
bringing
of
another?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
mr.
gutwein.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
true
as
a
general
rule,
but
why
should
it
be
true
in
a
fourth
amendment
case
when
there
is
a
practical
matter?
under
stone
there
isn't
any
federal
habeas
so
that
there's
no...
there's
no
federal
policy
of
exhaustion
that
needs
to
be
served.
why
don't
we
have
a
separate
rule
for
fourth
amendment
issues?
unknown
speaker
so
in
fourth
amendment
cases
you're
resting
it
not
on
the
habeas
exhaustion
requirement,
but
on
an
independent
rule
of
comity.
unknown
speaker
but
the
rule
of
comity,
in
effect,
would
enact
an
exhaustion
requirement
for
1983
which
is
not
required
by
habeas
policy?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
concerned
about
what
the
states
may
do,
but,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
strongest
argument
is,
as
a
general
rule
leaving
aside
the
particular
claim
involved,
that
if
you
don't,
in
effect,
have
the
rule
that
you
want,
you
in
effect
are
allowing
an
end
run
to
be
made
in
the
habeas
exhaustion
rules.
and
you
concede
that
that
argument
doesn't
apply
when
the
claim
is
a
fourth
amendment
claim
because
under
stone
v.
powell
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
federal
relitigation
anyway.
unknown
speaker
okay.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
for
comity
is
really
an
argument
for
an
exhaustion
requirement
under
1983
which
is
independent
of
federal
habeas
policy.
unknown
speaker
what
was
my
first
theory?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
that
doesn't
apply
here
because
of
stone.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
mean
he
wouldn't
complain
about
it.
maybe
he
didn't
know
it
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
i'm
curious
about
your
statement
about
being
barred
by
limitations
with
regard
to
the
second
issue
in
the
case.
is
it
your
position
that
this
claim
would
be
barred
by
limitations?
and,
if
so,
how
does
that
cut
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
one
should
stay
the
proceeding
or
dismiss
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then...
then
you've
given
us
an
incorrect
answer
with
respect
to
these
allegations
because
these
are
not
barred
by
the
limitations.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
because
it
would
be
tolled.
unknown
speaker
because--
unknown
speaker
--so
he
has...
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
it
would
be
barred
because
at
the
time
he
filed
the
complaint
2
years
had
run
between
the
time
of
the
search
and
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
had
not
filed
any
complaint
at
all,
but
waited
until
he
set
aside
his
conviction
and
then
filed
a
complaint,
it
would
have
been
tolled.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
it
depend
if
the
search
was
alleged
to
have
infected
his
conviction?
suppose
it
was
a
search
unrelated
to
his
conviction?
suppose
the
product
of
that
search
was
not
introduced
at
trial?
then
there
would
certainly
be
no
time
bar,
right?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
was
the
search.
unknown
speaker
then
it
would
be...
it
would
be...
there's
no
basis
for
saying
that
he
had
to
bring
a
habeas
action
first,
and
therefore
it
would
be
time
barred.
unknown
speaker
okay.
but,
now,
what
if
it...
what
if
the
evidence
was
introduced?
is
your
position
it
is
automatically
subject
to
a
prior
habeas
action
you
have
to
exhaust?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
you...
but
you
still...
don't
you
argue
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
applies
and
that
he
has
to
go
to
habeas
first,
no?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
what
if
he
says
in
his
1983
argument
in
his
petition;
this
evidence
was
introduced
but
i
acknowledge
that
its
effect
in
the
conviction
was
harmless
error?
what
if
he
says
that
in
his
1983
action?
unknown
speaker
then
he
doesn't
have
to
exhaust,
okay,
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
he
doesn't
say
it,
but
it's
really
a
close
question?
unknown
speaker
do
we
assume
that
it
did
infect
the
conviction,
or
do
we
look
into
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
what
harmful
effects?
what
harm
accrues
to
the
state
where
he's
not
asking
for
damages
for
his
continuing
incarceration...
there
i
can
see
the
state
would
say,
well,
gee,
you
know,
he's
been
held...
we're
civilly
liable
for
day...
or
somebody
is,
for
his
day-by-day
incarceration;
we'd
better
let
him
out.
all
that's
involved
is
a
past
unlawful
search
and
seizure;
it's
uncertain
whether
that
infected
his
conviction
or
not.
why
not
let
the
1983
proceed,
so
long
as
he's
only
claiming
damages
from
the
search
and
seizure?
what
harmful
effect
would
there
be
to
let
it
proceed?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say...
you
say
that
there's
issue
preclusion.
the
state
court
would
be
bound
by
the
1983
determination.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
decide
now
whether
it
does
or
doesn't,
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
why
should
we
make
this
prisoner
exhaust
simply
because
the
state
voluntarily
chooses
to
cause
itself
to
be
bound
by
the...
i
mean
if
it's
an
automatic
issue
preclusion
thing,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
strong
case.
but
if,
as
you're
telling
me,
it's
not
automatic
and
that
there
will
be
issue
preclusion
only
if
the
state
is
confident
enough
or
stupid
enough,
one
or
the
other,
to
come
in
and
manage
the
defense,
i
don't
see
that
that
has
any
claim
to
our
equitable
consideration.
the
answer
for
the
state
is
stay
out
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gutwein,
there's
one
point
that
you
made
a
little
bit
earlier,
and
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
understood
it
properly.
that
is
on
the
second
part,
whether
this
case
should
have
been
dismissed
or
held
in
abeyance.
you
said
indiana
law
is
crystal
clear
there
would
be
tolling.
if
that's
true,
then
would
you
object
to
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
conditioned
on
your
agreement
not
to
raise
any
limitation
bar
should
this
litigant
come
back,
after
exhausting,
into
the
federal
forum
on
a
1983
claim?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
bring
this
up
because
it's
done
routinely
when
states
dismiss
a
case
for
forum
nonconvenience.
there's
no
mechanism
for
transfer
from
one
state
to
another,
so
the
state
judge
will
usually
say,
well,
i'll
dismiss
this
case
but
i
don't
want
the
plaintiff
to
be
left
when
he
goes
into
state
number
two
and
faces
statute
of
limitation
defense.
or
defendants
will
say,
sure,
we'll
waive
the
statute
of
limitations,
dismiss,
and
the
plaintiff
can
rebring
it
in
the
convenient
forum.
so
i'm
suggesting
that
why
wouldn't
that
mechanism
apply
here?
maybe
you
could
have
a
caveat
about
he's
got
to
be
diligent
about
reinstating
the
litigation.
but
you
would
have
no
objection
to
making
the
dismissal
without
prejudice,
conditioned
on
your
not
raising
the
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
on
that
relief.
in
this
case
his
damages
all
seem
to
flow
from
his
confinement,
as
you
read
the
complaint,
but
he
has
this
allegation
about
destroying
his
wife's
clothing
and
so
forth.
supposing
instead
of
destroying
his
wife's
clothing,
he
said
he
destroyed
my
house,
they
burned
it
down,
or
did
some...
caused
some
serious
physical
property
damage
as
well
as
keeping
him,
could
he
maintain
that
action?
could
he
claim
damages
for
the
loss
of
property
during
an
illegal
search
without
exhausting?
unknown
speaker
he
could.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
proof...
say
that
the
allegations
he
would
prove
would,
incidentally,
also
demonstrate
that
the
conviction
is
improper.
a
set
of
facts...
you
can
see
what
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
has
one
count
in
his
complaint
for
damages
that
are
totally
unrelated
to
his
conviction.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
could
have
dependents
who
could
use
the
money.
i
mean,
there
could
be
cases
in
which
the
money
would
have
a
present
value
that
wouldn't
be
very
useful
to
him
if
he
had
to
wait
till
his
kids
graduated
from
school,
from
college.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
you
may
be
talking
about...
this
is
a
kind
of
confused
complaint,
but
you
could
have
a
complaint
that
is
totally
fourth
amendment
based,
so
there's
no
federal
habeas
relief
later
on,
and
in
which
one
of
the
claims
is
for
property
damage
that
doesn't
affect
his
conviction,
even
though
it
might
also
establish
the
conviction
is
bad.
and
you
say
he
should
nevertheless
wait
until...
why
should
he
wait
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
case
in
which
he
alleges
that
he
was
brutalized
in
obtaining
a
confession
from
him,
and
he
wants
just
damages
covering
the
pain
and
suffering
of
going
through
the
beating,
and
that's
all
he
asks
for,
but,
again,
it
might
show
that
the
confession...
you
know,
the
conviction
should
be--
unknown
speaker
--he'd
still
have
to
wait
there
too,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
said,
nevertheless
the
confession
was
true,
so
i
really
am
guilty,
but
i
still
want
damages
for
the
beating
i
took,
what
about
that
case?
unknown
speaker
who
does
he
make...
who
does
he
give
that
assurance
to?
i
mean
the
judge
that
he's
bringing
the
suit
before,
or
does
he
file
an
affidavit,
acknowledgement
of
guilt
which
will
later
be
binding
upon
him
in
the
state
habeas
proceeding.
i
don't
know
how
he
goes
about
doing
this.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
true.
if
he
says
that
in
his
complaint,
then
his
complaint
does
not
question
the
state
proceeding,
okay.
so
he
has
to
say
it
in
his
complaint.
well,
i
don't
know
that
even
that
is
correct
under
some
of
our
precedents
which
say
that
the
reason
for
suppressing...
it
is
not
a
defense
for
the
state
in
trying
to
get
a
confession
admitted
to
show
that,
in
fact,
it's
true,
if
it
was,
in
fact,
coerced.
so
that
an
acknowledgement
that
a
statement
he
made
was
true
but
nonetheless
coerced
would
still
require
its
exclusion
at
trial,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
true
generally
that
a
judicial
admission
in
one
case
doesn't
carry
over
to
the
next?
say
an
admission...
you
make
a
request...
in
response
to
a
request
for
admission
under
rule
36,
if
you
do
that
in
one
case
are
you
stuck
by
it
in
the
next
case
and
the
next
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
that
practical
consideration
transfer
into
the
theory
that
you
want
us
to
adopt
in
this
case?
are
you
saying
that
just
as
a
matter
of
comity,
that
these
cases
should
all
be
dismissed
if
they
implicate
some
of
the
actions
of
prosecuting
officials
that
were
performed
in
connection
with
obtaining
the
conviction,
just
have
a
broad
rule
of
comity--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
that
sweeping?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
wondering
if
those
might
not
go
even
beyond
attacking
the
legality
of
a
conviction.
as
we've
indicated
by
some
of
the
hypotheticals
here,
some
of
these
determinations,
some
of
these
inquiries
will
not
necessarily
bear
on
the
validity
of
the
conviction.
but
i
had
thought
you
were
indicating
that
even
those
suits
should
be
held
in
abeyance
until
the
lawfulness
of
the
custody
and
the
conviction
had
been
determined.
unknown
speaker
you'd
have
none
of
those
problems
if
you
agreed
to
stipulate
that
you
won't
raise
this
statute
of
limitations
if
the
plaintiff
ever
sues
you
again
on
this
claim,
with
reasonable
diligence.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
agreed
that
that
would
be
all
right,
that
you
would
stipulate
to
a
dismissal
without
prejudice,
conditioned
on
your
not
raising
the
statute
of
limitations
should
the
plaintiff
come
back
to
court
after
exhaustion.
unknown
speaker
you'd
be
happy...
you're
not
stipulating
that
we
have
authority
to
impose
it.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
done
in
forum
nonconvenience
cases
because
that
is
an
equitable
doctrine,
after
all.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
claiming
that
you
have
a
right
to
dismissal
without
that
stipulation,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gutwein.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not
apply
kind
of
an
analogy
of
rose
against
lundy
and
say
that
if
there's
doubt
about
the
thing,
dismiss.
unknown
speaker
it's
also
an
equitable
proceeding
so
that
we
have...
i
mean
it's
a
prerogative
writ,
so
we
have
much
more
discretion,
traditionally,
in
refusing
to
grant
the
petition.
unknown
speaker
is
the
essence
of
your
argument
this
is
just
like
the
old
days
when
you
had
a
claim
at
law
or
a
claim
for
specific
relief
in
equity,
you
could
pick
which
one
you
want?
unknown
speaker
but,
what
if
you
were
to
be
asked
to
stipulate
that
you
can
proceed
if
you
would
agree
not
to
urge
any
issue
preclusion
or
res
judicata
in
any
subsequent
habeas?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
