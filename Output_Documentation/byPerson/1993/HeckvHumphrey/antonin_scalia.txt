justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
petitioner,
roy
heck,
killed
his
wife
in
indiana.
a
state
court
convicted
him
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
sentenced
him
to
15
years
in
prison.
while
the
direct
appeal
from
his
conviction
was
pending,
heck
proceeding
without
the
assistance
of
a
lawyer
filed
this
lawsuit
in
federal
district
court
under
he
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
heck's
complaint
sought
money
damages
but
not
injunctive
relief
or
release
from
custody,
on
the
claim
that
respondents,
three
state
officials
who
had
assisted
in
the
criminal
investigation
had
engaged
in
unlawful
acts
leading
to
heck's
arrest
and
conviction.
the
district
court
dismissed
his
action
without
prejudice
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
dismissal
holding
that
if
the
plaintiff
in
a
federal
civil
rights
action
is
challenging
the
legality
of
his
conviction
so
that
his
victory
would
require
his
release
even
if
he
had
not
expressly
sought
that
relief.
the
suit
must
be
classified
as
a
habeas
corpus
action
and
dismissed
if
the
plaintiff
has
failed
to
exhaust
his
available
state
remedies.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm
but
on
grounds
somewhat
different
from
those
relied
on
by
the
lower
courts.
section
1983
creates
a
species
of
tort
liability
and
we
have
said
in
the
past
that
the
characteristics
of
section
1983
will
be
shaped
by
the
common
law
of
torts
as
it
existed
when
the
statute
was
enacted.
the
common
law
has
always
recognized
the
principle
that
civil
tort
actions
are
not
appropriate
vehicles
for
challenging
the
validity
of
outstanding
criminal
judgments.
an
action
for
malicious
prosecution,
for
example,
which
provides
the
closest
analogy
to
claims
of
the
type
considered
here,
requires
the
plaintiff
to
allege
and
prove
termination
of
the
prior
criminal
proceeding
in
his
favor.
this
court
has
long
expressed
similar
concerns
about
the
finality
and
consistency
of
judgments
and
hence,
has
been
disinclined
to
expand
opportunities
for
collateral
attack
on
criminal
convictions.
we
think
those
same
common
law
principles
applied
to
section
1983
suits.
when
a
state
prisoner
seeks
damages
in
such
a
suit,
the
district
court
must
consider
whether
a
judgment
in
his
favor
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
his
conviction
or
sentence.
if
so,
the
complaint
must
be
dismissed
unless
the
conviction
has
been
reversed
on
direct
appeal,
expunged
by
executive
order,
declared
invalid
by
a
state
tribunal
authorized
to
make
such
determination
or
called
into
question
by
a
federal
court's
issuance
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
a
favorable
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
in
the
section
1983
tort
action
would
not
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
or
sentence,
the
action
should
be
allowed
to
proceed
absent
some
other
bar
to
suit.
although
the
issue
in
cases
such
as
this
is
not,
therefore,
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies,
the
dismissal
of
heck's
1983
action
was
correct
because
the
courts
below
both
found
that
his
damages
claims
challenge
the
legality
of
his
conviction.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
souter,
joined
by
justices
blackmun,
stevens
and
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
