mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
proper
order
in
which
our
judicial
system
should
consider
state
prisoners'
attacks
on
the
validity
of
a
conviction.
petitioner's
rule
in
this
case
is
a
very
simple
one,
it's
very
easy
to
apply,
very
easy
to
understand,
but
it
creates
a
new
order
and
one
that
is
very
different
than
the
order
that
congress
considered
was
appropriate
in
enacting
the
exhaustion
requirement
in
section
2254(b),
and
the
order
that
this
court
has
generally
deemed
appropriate
in
its
comity
jurisprudence
such
as
younger,
which--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--we
believe
that
fourth
amendment
issues,
assuming
that
they
actually
attack
the
legality
of
the
conviction,
should
require
exhaustion.
and
that
is
because
the
rule
of
comity
is
that
state
courts
should
have
the
initial
opportunity
to
decide
the
issues,
both
factual
and
legal,
of
whether
a
state
prisoner's
conviction
is
lawful.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
exactly.
in
the
fourth
amendment
context,
this
court
has
held,
under
stone
v.
powell,
that
the
comity
interests
there
are
supreme.
that
this
court,
so
long
as
there's
been
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
review
the
matter,
will
defer
completely
to
the
state
court's
judgment.
and
i
believe
it
is
backwards
to
suggest
that
in
the
habeas
context
where
the
comity
is
at
its
greatest,
that
that
should
be
a
justification
in
the
1983
context
to
short
circuit,
at
that
point,
the
state's
opportunity
to
initially
decide
that
question.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
that
is
correct.
but
let
me
mind
you
that
some
states
may
not
follow
stone
v.
powell.
indeed,
indiana
does
not
follow
stone
v.
powell.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
that
is
correct.
but
we
win
under
your
first
theory,
and
we'd
be
perfectly
happy
with
that,
but
we
have
a
second
theory
that
is,
as
you
suggest--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--that
if
a
state
prisoner
can
do
an
end
run
around
section
2254,
that
that
ought
not
be
allowed,
and
therefore
to
the
extent
that
2254--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--we
believe
it
does
apply
here,
because...
and
this
is
a
matter
in
the
record.
this
petitioner
is
not
making
a
fourth
amendment
claim,
and
we
believe
that
that's
quite
clear
in
the
record.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
he
is
not,
and
let
me
refer
to
you
to
his
complaint.
and
i'm
now
looking
at
page
4
of
the
joint
appendix,
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
4
it
says
between
may
and
july
of
1987,
and
that
is
the
conduct
about
which
he
complains
after
that,
conduct
that
occurred
between
may
and
july
of
1987.
now,
he
refers
to
a
search
on
page
5
of
the
joint
appendix
that
occurred
in
1986,
and
that's
the
only
search
he
refers
to.
he
is
not
complaining
about
that
1986
search,
and
there...
indeed,
there
is
good
reason
for
him
not
to
complain
about
that,
and
that
is
because
he
filed...
the
search
in
this
case,
as
we
indicated
in
our
statement
of
facts,
occurred
in
october
of
1986.
he
filed
this
action
in
december
of
1988,
and
therefore
that
search
would
have
been
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
therefore
there
was
an
awfully
good
reason
for
him
to
not
complain
about
that
search.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
that's
possible
too,
but
we
believe
the
plain
language
of
this
complaint,
where
he
says
between
july...
may
and
july
of
1987,
and
then
he
goes
on
to
complain
about
conduct.
so
he's
not
complaining
about
a
search
here.
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
the
seventh
circuit
he
also
did
not
complain
about
a
search
there
also.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
justice
stevens,
in
this
case
indiana's
tolling
rule
is
really
quite
clear,
that
where
the
initiation
of
an
action
cannot
proceed
until
another
action
is
completed,
that
first
action
is
tolled.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
his--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--no,
we...
his
section
1983
action
would
not
be
tolled.
okay,
excuse
me,
would
not
be
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
this
action
would
be
tolled--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--this
action,
the
1983
action
would
be
tolled.
but
once,
now,
this
action
can
be
brought,
then
there
would
be
a
question
of
whether
the
allegations
contained
within
that
action
were
actually
timely.
so
i
think
that
those
are
two
quite
separate
issues
of
whether...
when
he
initially
brought
the
1983
action,
whether
it
would
be
tolled.
and
it
would
not,
the
properly
pled
allegations.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
that
is
correct.
now,
the
allegations
that
were--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--no.
because
if
later
he
had
filed
no
complaint
and
he
still
complained,
then,
about
conduct
between
1987...
excuse
me,
then
complained
about
conduct
in
1986,
that
would
still
be
barred.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
i
think
there
would
be
in
that
case,
because
then
the
injury...
if
the
search
was
never
introduced...
excuse
me,
if
the
evidence
was
never
introduced.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
then,
presumably,
the
injury--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--would
occur
in
1986.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
no.
if
the
evidence
was
introduced,
then
the
injury
would
have
begun
to
occur
when
he
was
convicted.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
yes,
we
do,
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
if
he
says
that
in
his
1983
action,
then
he
need
not
exhaust.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
because
he
then
is
not,
by
definition,
attacking
the
legality
of
his
conviction.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
if
it's
really
a
close--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--i
believe...
our
position
is
that
if
you
cannot
tell,
the
burden
here
should
rest
on
the
state
prisoner,
because
of
the
really
quite
serious
effects
that
allowing
this
kind
of
short
circuiting
around
state
judicial
remedies
would
have.
and
so
unless
that
prisoner
can
be
really
quite
convincing
that
this
is
not
an
attack
on
the
validity
of
a
conviction,
then
he
ought
to
exhaust.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
i
believe
the
harm
is
this,
and
that
is
that
if
the
1983
court
would
decide
an
issue
that
must
be
decided
in
a
later
proceeding
seeking
his
release,
then
at
that
point
the
state
court
has
been
denied
the
initial
opportunity
to
decide
an
issue
of
whether
his
conviction
is
proper
or
not,
and
it's
confined--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--it
is
possible
that
the
state
court
would
be
denied,
would
be
bound.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
you
cannot
decide
right
now.
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
montana,
it
depends
upon,
as
justice
ginsburg
averted
to,
the
degree
of
control
of
the
government
of
the
nonparty
in
that
action.
and
as
we're
standing
here
today
because
this
1983
action
has
not
ever
yet
been
pursued
or
tried;
we
don't
know
what
kind
of
control
the
state
would
have
exercised
in
that
action.
so
i
believe
that
it
is...
by
its
nature,
the
montana
test
is
a
fact-specific
test,
and
therefore
it
is
impossible
to
generalize
at
this
point.
but
even
if
they're
not
bound,
justice
scalia,
even
if
there's
a
matter
of
pure
res
judicata
principles,
the
practical
effects
would
be
enormous
here.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
we
don't
believe
that's
an
acceptable
answer
here
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
state
may
well
have
very
real
and
serious
interests
to
protect
in
this
type
of
litigation.
for
example,
the
state
may
be,
as
indiana
here
is,
statutorily
obligated
to
indemnify
these
officers,
assuming
they
acted
within
the
scope
of
their
duties.
in
addition,
in
these
types
of
litigation
there
may
be
legal
questions
at
issue
that
may
affect
state
policies
that
the
state
wants
to
preserve
and
protect
against
an
adverse
legal
judgment.
those
are
very
real
consequences.
and
to
put
the
state
in
this
horrible
box
of
saying
you
can
either
protect
your
interests
or
you
can
stay
out
is
really,
we
believe,
an
unacceptable
position
here,
particularly
for
what
petitioner
is
asking
for.
in
addition,
we
believe
that
that
creates
a
tremendous
hardship
on
the
individual
officers
themselves,
who
often
must
rely
upon
the
state
for
this
type
of
representation.
otherwise,
they
have
to
go
out
and
hire
outside
counsel.
and
these
are,
you
know,
police
officers
making
15,000
dollars
a
year.
they
don't
have
that
kind
of...
and
they
find
themselves
in
these
kinds
of
lawsuits
all
the
time,
every
day.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
let
me
offer
one
caveat
that
exists
in
every
tolling
provision,
and
even
in
the
state
provision,
and
that
is
that
tolling
does
not
apply
where
the
prisoner,
in
this
case,
does
not
act
diligently.
and
therefore
it's
a
little
difficult
to
stand
here
today
and
waive
our
statute
of
limitations
defense
when
we
don't
know
whether
he'll
act
diligently
or
not.
that
is
always
an
issue,
but
that's
an
issue
whether
it's
a
stay
or
it's
a
dismissal.
but
presuming
that
he
acts
diligently,
the
state
of
indiana
will
not
press
a
statute
of
limitations
defense.
there's
just
no
legal
basis
for
it.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
no
objection
whatsoever,
your
honor.
let
me,
again,
emphasize
the
practical
consequences
of
the
rule
that
they
propose
here.
they
propose
that
based
upon
the
prayer
for
relief
alone,
the
fact
that
he
has
limited
his
request
for
damages,
ought
to
get
you
immediately
into
federal
court.
that
result
would
surely
provide
an
incentive
for
state
prisoners
to
bring
these
section
1983
actions
immediately.
let's
take...
and
the
fact
that
he
has
limited
his
request
to
damages
and
not
expressly
asked
for
release
does
not,
in
any
way,
militate
the
serious
comity
considerations
that
are
at
issue
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
yes,
he
could.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
because
that
loss
of
property
would
not,
in
any
way,
be
an
attack
on
the
legality
of
his
conviction.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
sure,
yeah.
no.
in
that
case,
if
a
determination
by
the
1983
court
would
also
be
a
determination
that
in
subsequent
proceeding
the
state
court,
or
possibly
even
the
federal
habeas
court,
would
have
to
make,
we
believe
that
comity
requires
that
that
prisoner
exhaust.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but,
let
me
emphasize
that
this
is
merely
a
timing
question.
as
i
began
the
argument,
this
involves
the
orderly
disposition
of
these
claims,
and
if
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
bar,
presuming
that
he
exhausts
the
state
claims
diligently,
then
he
can
later
come
back
and
bring
that
damages
action.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
here
that
his
immediate
need
for
damages
for
that
claim
surely
is
not
as
great
as
a
state
prisoner's
immediate
need
for
release
in
this
court.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
that
is
true.
but
both
congress
and
this
court
have
consistently
recognized
that
when
a
prisoner
is
seeking
the
restoration
of
their
liberty,
something
that
surely
has
a
far
greater
value
than
mere
damages,
that
delay
is
appropriate
so
that
we
may
allow
the
state
the
opportunity,
initially,
to
decide
those
questions.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
the
reason
why
is
because
of
the
potential
for
short
circuiting
the
state
processes
in
that
case;
that
the
value,
the
comity
values
that
both
congress
and
this
court
have
repeatedly
emphasized,
that
it
is
critical
in
our
judicial
system
that
state
courts
have
the
initial
opportunity
to
decide
these
issues.
and
in
that
case,
under
your
hypothesis,
a
necessary
element
of
a
later
state
claim
would
have
been
decided
by
the
federal
court,
and
therefore
the
state
court
would
have
been
denied
the
opportunity
to
decide
that
issue.
now,
i
admit
that
that's
a...
that's
a
difficult
question,
and
luckily...
i'm
glad
that
that
question
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
this
is
a
square
attack
on
the
legality
of
the
conviction.
this
is
a
petitioner
who
says
all
of
my
damages
flow
from
the
fact
that
i
am
wrongfully
confined.
but
as
a
general
matter...
putting
aside
the
more
difficult
cases,
as
a
general
matter,
in
these
types
of
cases
when
a
state
prisoner
says
i
should
have
never
been
in
jail,
those
types
of
claims,
if
decided
by
a
1983
court,
will
inevitably
lead
to
a
state
prisoner
hopping
across
the
street,
going
over
to
the
state
courthouse,
and
seeking
his
relief.
and
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--exactly.
in
some
ways--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--i
believe
that's
an
easier
case,
that's
right.
because
if
he
establishes
that
and
it's
no
harmless
error,
and
it's
relatively
difficult
to
establish
harmless
error
when
a
confession
has
been
beat
out
of
an
individual
and
coerced.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
it
would
go
right
to
federal
court.
please
proceed,
get
your
money.
because
in
that
case
if
he
says
i'm
innocent...
i'm
guilty,
i'm
the
convict
here,
i
ought
to
be
in
jail.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
in
a
variety
of
manners.
first
of
all,
i
presume
that
he
would
state
this
in
his
complaint,
because
if
his
complaint
just
says
a
confession
was
beat
out
of
me,
it
was
coerced.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
in
that
case,
then
i
believe
that
he
ought
to
exhaust.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
rule.
it
is
possible,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
completely
makes
a
difference
here,
whether
it's
a
mere
judicial
admission.
i
believe
what
is
critical
here
is
that
if
this...
viewing
the
substance
of
the
complaint
rather
than
it's
form,
viewing
the
substance
of
this
complaint,
if
this
can
be
viewed
as
an
attack
on
the
convictions
so
that
a
determination,
should
it
be
favorable,
would
be
the
same
determination
that
a
later
state
court
would
make...
that
petitioner,
in
order
to
not
short
circuit
the
state
judicial
proceedings,
ought
to
exhaust.
but
let's
take
really
the
most
difficult
case
here.
i
think
the
most
difficult
case
is
if
the
prisoner
doesn't
want
to
be
released.
and
i
think
there's
good
reason
in
these
cases
to
not
really
believe
these
petitioners.
any
petitioner
that
says
please
pay
me
because
i'm
wrongfully
confined,
but
yet
i
don't
want
to
be
released,
i
think
there's
good
reason
to
be
suspicious
of
that.
but
let's
take
really
the
hardest
case,
that
we
actually
believe
this
petitioner
that
he
no
interest
whatsoever
in
release,
that
there
is
still
good
reason
to
require
to
go
ahead
and
exhaust.
because
there
are
two
consequences
that
would
follow
from
a
successful
judgment
in
his
favor.
number
one,
he
would,
in
fact,
get
damages.
and
as
was
averted
to
in
the
other...
earlier
questioning,
any
rational
state,
when
a
petitioner
receives
a
20-year
sentence

of

mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
there
are
two
separate--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--we
don't
believe
that
that's...
there
are
two
separate
grounds
for
our
theory.
one
is
congress'
desire
in
section
2254(b)
that
state
prisoners
ought
to
first
exhaust
before
they
attack
the
legality
of
their
conviction.
but,
second,
on
top
of
that,
we
believe
that
there
are
general
comity
principles
that
are
fully
implicated
here,
and
that
those
comity
principles--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
this
court...
this
case
presents
a
relatively
narrow
issue,
and
that
is
a
direct
attack
on
the
legality
of
the
conviction,
and
therefore
this
court
could
rule
in
that
narrow
manner,
based
upon
sort
of
pure
2254(b)
principles.
but
we
believe
that
the
most
rational
system
here
is
one
that
takes
into
account
those
other
cases
outside
of
pure
2254(b)
principles.
this
court
need
not
decide
that
issue,
but
we
believe
that
that
is
really
the
most
rational,
orderly
system
for
handling
attacks
on
convictions.
let
me
address
for
a
moment
issue
two.
their
argument
is
this
case
has
to
be
dismissed
merely
because
there
is
jurisdiction,
and
in
addition
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
bar.
let
me
address
the
jurisdictional
point
for
a
moment.
the
fact
that
there
is
jurisdiction
alone
does
not
require
a
stay,
as
this
court's
habeas
cases
demonstrate.
there
may
be...
a
12(b)(1)
lack
of
jurisdiction
dismissal
may
not
be
appropriate,
but
a
12(b)(6)
dismissal
is
appropriate.
we
believe
that
exhaustion
is
a
requirement
for
these
types
of
claims,
and
therefore
even
though
there
is
jurisdiction,
he
has
not
satisfied
a
prerequisite
and
dismissal
is
appropriate
under
12(b)(6)
and
that
ought
to
be
enough.
furthermore,
the
cost
of
these
cases
being
on
the
docket
is
really
very
real.
the
fact
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
will
not
be
meritorious,
and
there's
a
real
cost
to
getting
rid
of
those
cases.
a
federal
court
has
to
look
for
these
nonmeritorious
cases,
has
to
review
the
file,
has
to
send
an
order,
has
to
receive
that
order
back.
all
of
that
takes
time,
and
that
is
not
cost
free.
in
addition,
there's
a
cost
to
our
office.
we
also
have
to
respond
to
these
cases.
in
addition,
there
is
a
cost
to
the
defendants
themselves
who,
in
this
case,
are
defendants
in
a
3
million
dollar
lawsuit.
that
affects
their
credit
rating
and
that
could
prevent
them
from
buying
a
house.
there's
a
very
real
tangible
cost.
so
there
are
real
costs,
but
there
is--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--we
establish
the
mortgage...
that
gets
rid
of
the
mortgage
problem,
but
that
does
not
get
rid
of
the
fact
that
federal
courts
have
to
work
hard
to
get
rid
of
these
nonmeritorious
cases
off
of
its
docket.
it
may--
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
--that's
correct.
we
would
be
happy
with
that
result.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
that's
true.
mr.
matthew
r.
gutwein
a
12(b)(6)
dismissal,
that
is
correct,
we
have
a
right
to
that
dismissal.
the
mere
fact
that
this
court
has
a
quote,
virtually
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction
does
not
in
any
way
resolve
the
stay
versus
dismissal
issue,
and
that
is
really
the
vast
majority
of
petitioner's
argument.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
we
would
urge
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
