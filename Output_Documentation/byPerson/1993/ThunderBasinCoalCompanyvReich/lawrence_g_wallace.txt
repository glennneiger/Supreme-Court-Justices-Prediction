mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
starting
point
of
our
submission
is
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
its
1981
decision
in
donovan
v.
dewey,
the
one
prior
occasion
on
which
this
court
considered
the
federal
mine
safety
act
of
1977,
and
in
particular
its
inspection
provisions,
and
upheld
their
constitutionality
against
a
fourth
amendment
challenge
under
marshall
v.
barlows,
because
no
warrants
are
required
for
the
periodic
inspections
prescribed
by
this
act.
and
in
deciding
that
this
was
permissible
for
congress
in
treating
this
industry
under
this
statutory
scheme,
the
court
pointed
out
at
page
602
of
volume
452
u.s.
that
congress
was
plainly
aware
that
the
mining
industry
is
among
the
most
hazardous
in
the
country,
and
that
the
poor
health
and
safety
record
of
this
industry
has
significant
deleterious
effects
on
interstate
commerce,
and
the
court
there
cited
some
of
the
provisions
in
the
pre--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
donovan
v.
dewey,
452
u.s.
594,
the
one
previous
case
under
this
act.
it
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i...
i'm--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i'm--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i'm
showing
that
what
this
court
recognized
in
the
legislative
history
and
legislative
structure
of
the
act
is
highly
relevant
to
analysis
of
that
structure
and
the
congressional
purposes
as
they
relate
to
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
the
one
case
in
this
court
that
dealt
with
this
act,
and
i'm
just
using
it
as
a
starting
point
for
our
explanation
of
what
congress
was
doing
in
revising
the
remedial
provisions
from
the
pre-existing
ones,
because
they
was
a
considerable
structural
change
made
in
the
penalty
provisions,
and
this
was
based
on
concerns
about...
as
the
preamble
of
the
act
said,
that
this
court
pointed
to
in
donovan
v.
dewey,
and
we've
reproduced
this
provision
on
page
1a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
first
one
that
the
court
referred
to
is
(c)
here,
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
provide
more
effective
means
and
measures
for
improving
the
working
conditions
and
practices
in
the
nation's
coal
and
other
mines
in
order
to
prevent
death
and
serious
physical
harm,
and
in
order
to
prevent
occupational
diseases
originating
in
such
mines.
part
of
what
congress
did
in
this
legislation
was
to,
for
basically
the
same
reasons,
replace
what
it
found
to
be
cumbersome,
repetitious,
and
ineffective
enforcement
mechanisms
in
the
prior
law
which
it
complained
in
the
committee
reports
were
allowing
protracted
litigation
while
the
conditions
that
were
cited
by
the
secretary
of
interior,
who
was
administering
at
that
time,
went
uncorrected,
and
it
replaced
this
with
a
restructured
and
streamlined
enforcement
scheme
that
is
the
scheme
at
issue
here,
and
it
created
the
federal
mine
safety
commission,
a
new
agency
independent
of
the
department
of
labor,
to
hear
complaints,
and
for
the
first
time
it
included
a
system
of
daily
penalties
that
could
be
imposed
for
failure
to
abate
a
violation
after
the
violation
has
been
cited.
the
whole
structure
and
purpose
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
cite
and
that
the
court
itself
cited
in
donovan
v.
dewey
in
footnote
7,
referring
to
the
pertinent
senate
and
house
reports,
was
to
tilt
the
balance
away
from
the
direction
of
protracted
litigation
while
the
violation
remained
uncorrected
toward
a
system
that
would
provide
incentives
to
correct
the
violation
and
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
miners
and
then
do
the
litigating.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
question--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
question
in
the
case
goes
to
the
way
this
scheme
will
work
and
whether
preenforcement
preemptive
strikes,
as
the
court
of
appeals
called
them,
can
be
brought
in
the
district
court
to
interfere
with
the
statutory
process
for
abating
any
violation
that
has
been
cited
by
the
inspector.
so
we
must
look,
in
determining
how
the
act
should
work,
beyond
the
narrow
confines
of
this
case,
and
i
don't
want
to
belittle
the
fact
that
congress
did
think
for
these
inspections
to
be
effective
that
the
miners
should
have
a
right
to
have
a
representative
of
their
own
accompanying
the
inspector,
perhaps
pointing
out
things
to
the
inspector
that
the
inspector
would
otherwise
not
have
brought
to
his
attention.
a
representative
of
the
employer
also
accompanies
the
inspector,
so
the
employer's
representative
is
present
along
with
the
miner's
representative
every
step
of
the
way
and
is
there
to
see
to
it
that
the
miner's
representative
does
not
overstep
the
bounds
of
the
purpose
for
which
he
is
present,
which
is
to
assist--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
don't
get
notice,
and
they
therefore
do
not
invariably
participate,
and
that
is
the
reason
why,
in
the
designation
which
appears
at
pages
29
and
30
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
miners
who
designated
these
two
men
to
be
their
representatives
designated
themselves,
or
some
of
themselves,
as
the
alternates
in
case
these
persons
were
unavailable.
this
is
part
of
the
reason
why
there
are
ripeness
problems
with
the
complaint
that's
being
made
here.
it's
speculative
whether
these
representatives
would
even
participate
in
an
inspection,
since
there
is
a
criminal
prohibition
against
giving
anyone
advance
notice
of
the
inspection,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
take
the
position
that
there
has
not
been,
because
there's
never
even
been
a
citation
issued
by
the
mine
safety
&
health
administration
that
there
has
been
a
violation.
we're
at
a
very
anticipatory
stage
in
the
bringing
of
this
lawsuit.
an
official
of
the
department
of
labor
advised
the
petitioner
that
these
representatives
are
eligible.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
because
the
view
of
the
district
director
of
the
msha
will
not
necessarily
prevail
if
petitioner
wants
to
litigate
it
through
the
processes
that
are
channeled
in
the
act
for
litigating
it.
the
commission
is
an
independent
agency
which
may--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--disagree
with
that
interpretation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--as
it
happens,
there
has
been
no
citation
of
the
violation
issued
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
not
final
until
the
agency
has
done
a
citation
for
a
violation--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
has
proposed
a
penalty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
certainly
would
be
more
final
than
it
is
now.
it's
not
our
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
agency
doesn't
do
the
designating
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
just
the
miners
choose
their
representatives.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there's
no
necessity
for
that.
it's
only
because
a
controversy--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--arose--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
they...
i
don't
know
who
would
notify
the
miners'
representatives
to
come.
the
agency
cannot
give
anyone
advance
notice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
the
statute,
and
under
the
procedures
that
are
used
by
the
agency,
groups
of
miners
can
designate
representatives,
and
they
just
make
the
designation
to
the
employer,
who
is
supposed
to
do
a
posting
of
the
designation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
my
understanding.
i
don't
think
there's
any
requirement
that
the
designation
be
made
to
the
agency.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
employees
can
designate...
that's
correct.
the
employees
can
designate
to
the
employer
who
their
representatives
will
be,
and
the
employer
accepts
that
and
posts
the
notice.
there's
no
need
for
the
agency
to
get
involved.
it's
only
because
a
dispute
arose
that
the
agency
got
involved
in
this
instance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
can
be...
there
can
be
duplicate
designations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
then
the
inspector
can,
if
more
than
one
shows
up,
can
choose...
can
ask
them
to
determine
among
themselves
which
one
should
accompany
him,
or,
if
he
feels
he
would
be
aided
by
more
than
one,
he
can
have
more
than
one
going
along,
but
the
statute
says
there
has
to
be
an
equal
number
of
representatives
of
the
employer,
so
if
the
employer
chooses
to
have
only
one
representative
go
along,
then
only
one
representative
of
the
employees
can
go
on
the
inspection.
this--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
this
particular
instance,
there
are
only
the
two
representatives
listed
on
the
exhibit
which
you
mention,
which
is
on
page
29.
on
page
22,
in
an
earlier
designation,
they
were
identified
as
affiliated
with,
or
associated
with
the
union,
but
the
union
has
never
been
named
in
this
instance
as
a
designated
representative,
although
the
regulation
does
allow
an
organization
to
be
named.
it
happens
that
in
this
instance
it
was
only
the
two
individuals
who
are
employees
of
the
union
who
were
designated
on
page
29,
and
then
on
page
30,
the
employees
designated
themselves
as
alternative
representatives,
alternate
representatives
in
case
these
two
people
aren't
there
for
the
inspection.
the
inspections
do
take
place
under
the
statute
at
least
twice
a
year
in
this
kind
of
mine,
which
is
a
surface
mine,
but
they're
not
on
a
regular
schedule.
the
four
times
a
year
requirement
is
for
underground
mines,
which
are
much
more
time-consuming
to
inspect.
even
in
a
large
surface
mine
such
as
this
one,
the
inspection
probably
would
not
take
more
than
2
or
3
days,
i'm
told,
whereas
an
underground
mine
could
take
a
month
or
two,
if
it's
a
large
facility,
there
are
many
problems
there
of
gases
and
structural
problems
that
need
to
be
looked
into.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
is
to
assure
that
the
review
will
proceed
in
only
one
court
of
appeals
and
not
in
the
d.c.
circuit
and
also
in
the
regional
circuit.
that
is
what
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
it's
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
that
the
jurisdiction
is
initially
conferred
for
review
either
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
or
in
the
regional
court
of
appeals,
but
upon
filing
in
one
of
those
courts,
then
that
court's
jurisdiction
becomes
exclusive.
before
that,
it
would
have
been
concurrent
with
the
other
court.
i
really
think
that
it's
just
in
the
context
of
that
that
congress
used
this
expression,
and
it's
upon
the
filing
in
one
of
the
courts
that
that
court
becomes
the
one
with
the
exclusive
authority
in
that
case,
so
that
there
won't
be
duplication
of
proceedings.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
is
correct,
and
certainly
to
the
extent
that
the
regulations
are
legislative
in
nature.
there
is
in
this
act
a
provision
that
we
refer
to
in
some
detail
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
section
811
of
the
act,
which
is
not
one
of
the
provisions
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
but
which
is
of
some
significance
here
in
illuminating
the
kinds
of
challenges
to
regulations
that
are
normally
authorized.
this
is
a
provision
that
says
that
the
secretary
by
rule
shall
develop
and
promulgate
improved
mandatory
health
or
safety
standards
for
the
protection
of
life
and
prevention
of
injuries
in
coal
or
other
mines.
it's
a
big
legislative
rule-making
responsibility
that
has
been
placed
on
the
secretary,
and
there
is
a
subsection
(d)
there
that
provides
for
judicial
review
of
any
of
those
rules
by
any
person
who
may
be
adversely
affected
by
one
of
these
new
substantive
rules.
he
may
at
any
time
within
60
days
of
its
adoption
file
a
petition
challenging
the
validity
of
that
mandatory
standard.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
correct.
that
would
be
a
disputed
issue,
and
the
method
of
disputing
it
is
channeled
by
the
statute,
and
we
say
that
it
was
designed
to
be
an
exclusive
method
and
to
eliminate
the
district
court's
suits
that
had
been
such
a
problem
under
the
pre-existing
scheme,
in
which--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
it
is
a
different
argument,
and
our
primary
argument
in
the
case
is
that
the
statute
set
up
an
exclusive
method
for
handling
of
these
disputes
through
an
orderly,
administrative
process,
followed
by
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
a
centralized
agency
that
would
be
acting
with
expertise.
this
is
precisely
what
happened
in
the
kerr-mcgee
litigation
that
was
decided
after
this
district
court
complaint
was
filed,
in
which
the
administrative
law
judge
and
then
the
commission
passed
on
an
identical
claim
that
an
employee
of
the
union
could
not
be
designated
as
a
representative.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
nothing
explicit
that
precludes
other
remedies,
but
of
course,
that
was
true
in
the
block
case,
and
in
whitney
bank,
and
in
many
other
cases.
there's
another
line
of
cases,
not
relied
upon
in
our
brief
but
which
i
brought
to
mr.
bishop's
attention
yesterday,
in
which
the
court
has
held
that
detailed
remedies
in
a
district
court
under
a
particular
statute,
even
though
they
don't
in
terms
oust
other
possible
remedies,
should
sometimes
be
interpreted
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy
provided
for
the
particular
kind
of
complaint
being
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
wasn't--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i...
what
i
think
i'm
saying,
or
if...
is
that
hardship
is
not
the
sole
criterion.
what
i'm
suggesting
about
the
abbott
labs
trilogy
is
that
while
there
is
no
crisp
distinction
about
when
a
preenforcement
review
has
been
recognized,
a
good
deal
of
light
is
shed
on
that
by
the
distinction
that
does
exist
in
administrative
law
between
legislative
regulations
in
which
new
substantive
standards
are
being
imposed
that
affect
primary
conduct,
and
that
is
what
the
court
talked
about
in
abbott
labs,
that
primary
conduct
was
being
affected
by
what
the
agency
did
in
that
case.
and
in
the
companion
case
that
was
held
to
be
ripe
for
review,
gardner
v.
toilet
goods,
the
court
referred
to
what
the
agency
had
done
as
amplifying
the
statutory
standard
imposing
new
standards
that
will
affect
the
primary
conduct
of
the
people
who
brought
the
challenge,
whereas
interpretations,
or
even
interpretive
regulations,
just
purport
to
state
the
agency's
position
about
the
meaning
of
the
statute
that
someone
can
litigate.
now,
typically,
when
there
are
provisions
for
review
of
the
validity
of
the
new
legislative
regulations,
they
have
to
be
brought
quite
promptly.
in
this
statute
itself,
there's
a
60-day
provision.
the
suits
in
abbott
laboratories
were
brought
within
a
matter
of
months.
the
regulations
there
were
adopted
in
june
'63,
and
the
suit
was
filed
in
september
of
'63,
and
in
the
toilet
goods
case
in
november
of
'63
for
regulations
adopted
in
june
of
'63.
here,
the
regulation
really
does
not
address
this
issue.
the
regulation
was
issued
in
1978.
it's
the
same
issue
that
arises
under
the
statute,
whether
the
outside
representative--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--assuming
it's
permissible,
but
certainly
laches
is
a
criterion
for
when
it
should
be
permissible.
i
can't
point
to
a
case
in
which
one
has
been
held
untimely
on
the
basis
of
laches,
but
i
do
think
that
what's
involved
in
this
case
is
the
kind
of
preemptive
strike
that
could
undo
the
whole
statutory
scheme,
because
any
case
before
a
citation
is
issued
could
be
diverted
into
district
court
on
a
very
similar
rationale.
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
pointed
out,
it
often
can
be
said
that
there
are
other
statutory
rights
or
claims
made
in
the
guise
of
constitutional
claims
that
are
inconsistent
with
the
agency's
application
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
would,
because
the
citation--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
citation
initiates
the
statutory
process,
which
is
built
in
with
incentives
to
bring
about
compliance
while
the
litigation
is
occurring,
but
there's
no
pre-litigation
deprivation
of
anything.
the
petitioner's
claims
can
be
heard
in
that
process
and
on
judicial
review,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
can
happen
in
the
administration
of
whether
penalty
should
be
assessed,
which
is
to
be
determined
initially
by
a
proposal
by
the
agency,
and
then
is
to
be
determined
independently
by
the
administrative
law
judge
and
by
the
commission.
in
kerr-mcgee
itself,
the
company
decided
to
comply
and
then
just
to
contest
the
initial
citation,
which
wound
up
to
be
a
$300
penalty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
would
have
jurisdiction
under
the
all
writs
act,
and
it
would
require
a
pretty
extreme
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
part
of
our
submission,
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
