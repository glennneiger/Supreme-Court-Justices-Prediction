justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
bishop,
you
could
have
refused
to
recognize
these
representatives,
i
assume,
and
then
stood
the
risk
of
having
a
citation
issued?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
you
could
have
asked
for
a
review
by
the
commission,
which
would
have
gone
to
an
administrative
law
judge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
at
that
time,
do
you
acknowledge
that
you
could
have
raised
the
same
issue
about
the
validity
of
the
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
your
position
that
notwithstanding
the
availability
of
that
scheme,
within
which...
the
framework
of
which
you
could
have
raised
the
challenge,
that
you
can
go
direct
to
district
court--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
challenge
the
validity
of
the
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bishop,
is
there
any
concern
here
about
the
lack
of
final
agency
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
there's
been
final
agency
action
here
with
regard
to
the
issue
raised
in
the
district
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--would
there
be
any
mechanism
whereby
during
the
administrative
review
the
application
of
the
penalty
could
be
suspended,
or
something?
is
there
any
temporary
relief
available?
