justice
antonin
scalia
well,
abbott...
abbott
labs,
the
challenge
to
the
regulation
was
a
challenge
to
an
inevitable
interpretation
of
the
regulation.
there
was
no
doubt
that
that
regulation
would
have
to
be
interpreted
to
prevent
what
the
company
said
could
not
lawfully
be
prevented.
in
your
case,
as
you've
acknowledged,
the
regulation
need
not
be
interpreted
that
way.
it
might
have
been
interpreted
ultimately
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
you
should
have
waited
your
turn
to
assert
that.
i
mean...
or
at
least
as
far
as
abbott
labs
is
concerned.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
invoke
abbott
labs.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bishop,
let
me
come
back
to
your
contention
that
unlike
toilet
goods,
this
case
does
not
involve
a
"may",
that
there's
a
certainty
of
what
would
happen.
i
understood
it
to
be
the
case
that
it
was
not
at
all
certain
that
the
agency
in
this
case
would
issue
a
citation.
it
had
the
option,
which
your
action
deprived
it
of,
of
proceeding
either
the
citation
route,
or
it
could
have
gone
to
district
court,
couldn't
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
enforce
what
it
wanted,
in
which
case
you
would
have
had
the
same
opportunity
to
make
the
argument
you
ultimately
made
by
going
the
roundabout
route
to
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
dictum
in
abbott
labs
doesn't
really
square
very
well
with
whitney
bank
v.
new
orleans,
does
it,
which
is
a
case
that
abbott
labs
did
not
purport
to
be
overruling.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
it
did
in
whitney
bank,
either,
explicitly.
i
mean,
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
there's
no
explicit
preclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
explicitly,
however.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
the
point
you're
making
about
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
this
is
an
important
piece
of
legislation?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
isn't
an
unsafe
condition
that's
sitting
out
there
ready
to
kill
somebody.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
the
nomination
of
certain
individuals
instead
of
others
as
inspectors.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
independent
agency,
but
so
far
as
the
action
of
the...
what
you
might
say
the
prosecuting
agency
is
concerned,
that
is
final.
it
has
signed
off,
hasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
in
a
sense,
nothing's
ever
final
until
a
court...
you
certainly
wouldn't
make
the
argument,
when
an
agency
decides
something,
well,
we
don't
know
whether
that'll
prevail
until
it
gets
to
the
district
court,
and
therefore
it's
not
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
point.
that's
a
different
point,
but
why...
i
don't
know
why
going
to
a
different
agency,
the
independent
commission,
to
get
the
validity
of
the
first
agency's
decision
established,
the
necessity
of
going
there,
renders
the
first
agency's
decision
nonfinal.
is
that
the
position
you're
taking,
it's
not
final
until
the
commission
makes
an
adjudication?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
you
say
the
citation
is
what
renders
it
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
citation
is
what
renders
it
final.
you
agree
it
would
be
final
when
the
citation
issued,
at
least.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
a
different
argument
from
finality.
justice
ginsburg
asked
you,
you
know,
whether
it
was
final
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
finality
is
one
thing,
and
even
though
it's
final,
it
may
be
that
the
scheme
of
the
statute
shows
that
it
is
not
yet
challengeable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
you
could
say
that
the
same
kind
of
a
scheme
existed
to
some
extent
in
abbott
labs.
you
have
the
provision
in
the
apa,
which
says
that
the
remedy,
if
none
other
is
provided,
is
suit
in
district
court
to
challenge
the
regulation
after
it's
applied
to
you.
nonetheless,
we
allowed
an
exception
from
that
normal
scheme
because
of
the
severe
hardship
in
that
case.
are
you
saying
never?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
never
here,
or
are
you
saying
that
hardship
isn't
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
any
cases
that
say
that,
that
say
that
if
you
challenge
a
regulation
facially
you
have
to
do
so
within
a
certain
amount?
i
mean,
there
are
statutory
provisions
that
say
the
challenge
must
be
brought
within
60
days,
but
i
had
always
thought
that
unless
there
is
such
a
statutory
provision,
you
can
challenge
a
regulation
whenever.
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
preenforcement
challenge
is
permissible.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you'd
object
even
after
the
citation
was
issued,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
not
on
finality
grounds,
on
grounds
that--
