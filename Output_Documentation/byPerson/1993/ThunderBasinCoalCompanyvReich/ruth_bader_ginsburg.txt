justice
ruth
bader

abbott
labs
was
part
of
a
trilogy,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
case
comes
closest
to
the
toilet
goods
decision.
tell
me
why
not,
why
you
think
you
fall
within
the
abbott
laboratories
decision
and
not
the
toilet
goods.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
nothing
is
happening
immediately.
all
that's
happening
is
you're
posting
two
names,
or
maybe
three
names,
if
you
have
to
list
the
union.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
administrator
said
that
there
would
be
very
circumscribed
availability
of
the
records,
that
they
would
not
be
available
for
any
and
all
purposes
but
only
for
this
safety
purpose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
speculating
on
a
lot
of
what
may
be,
as
distinguished
from
the
gardner...
abbott
laboratories,
where
there
wasn't
any
question
about
what
was
going
to
happen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
exactly
the
position
you
could
argue
ultimately
before
the
commission,
as
has
happened
in
other
cases,
i
understand
it
has
gone
that
route.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
the
cost
to
that
other
mine
of
capitulating
compares
to
the
cost
to
abbott
laboratories?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
have
preenforcement
review
available
to
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
cost
of
using
the
route
that
congress
directed.
you
said...
we
see
in
this
other
case
they
capitulated,
and
i'm
asking
whether
you
have...
all
the
dire
consequences
that
you
predicted
had
occurred
in
that
other
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
limitation
on
the
union's
right.
it's
a
limitation
on
the
worker's
right,
but
the
underlying
right
of
the
owner
is
from
state
property
law,
as
justice
stevens
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
source
of
the
right
is
state
law.
the
national
labor
relations
act
deals
with
the
worker's
right,
and
it
doesn't
give
them
a
right
to
go
as
far
as
to
override
the
property
owner's
right.
i
don't
see
how
you
attribute
the
property
owner's
right
to
the
national
labor
laws.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
a
federal
law
respects
a
right
under
state
law,
it
becomes
a
federal
law,
is
that
the
position
you're
taking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
time
the
federal
law
doesn't
encroach
on
the
state
law
domain,
that
state
law
then
becomes
federal
law.
that's
the
position
you're
taking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
how
does
what
is
a
state
property
law
become
a
federal
law
when
all
the
federal
law
does
is
says
that
the
worker's
right
that
this
federal
law
deals
with
doesn't
go
as
far
as
to
override
the
state's
property--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing
happens
immediately
as
a
result
of
the
posting.
nothing
then
happens
until
something...
until
there's
an
incident
at
the
mine,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's...
what
happens
after
the
posting?
conceivably
nothing
could
happen,
right?
everything
is
going
along
fine
at
the
mine,
and
there
isn't
any
cause
for
an
inspection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
what
your
exposure
is,
because
we
all
recognize
you
have
conceded
that
the
legal
question
of
whether
this
is
improper
interpretation
of
the
regulation
that
union
representatives
can
be
the
designees,
that
that
can
be
settled
in...
through
the
ordinary
administrative
route,
so
i...
your
whole
case
depends
on
something
on
the
order
of
an
abbott
laboratories
disaster
facing
you,
and
i
just
don't
see
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
so
many
enterprises
that
would
love
to
come
into
district
court
in
the
first
instance
and
bypass
a
cumbersome
administrative
procedure
with
aljs
and
commissions,
and
most
of
them
could
make
out
some
kind
of
case
that
it
would
be
far
better
if
they
could,
from
their
point
of
view,
go
right
into
district
court.
i
just
don't
see
where
your
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
great
mass
of
enterprises
that
would
like
to
avoid
the
administrative
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
decision
do
you
get
that
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
abbott
laboratories
relied
on...
i
thought
abbott
laboratories
relied
on
what
was
going
to
happen
immediately.
all
the
labels
were
going
to
have
to
be
changed,
all
the
promotional
material
had
to
be
thrown
out--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--whole
stocks
would
have
to
destroyed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
picking
up
on
a
case
that's
cited,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
only
at
the
bottom
of
footnote
25
of
the
brief
as
your
featured
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
mr.
bishop
told
us
that
there
are
quarterly
inspections,
so
that
there
would
be
periodically
inspections,
and
he
also
said
that
with
respect
to
finality
the
interpretation
of
the
regulation
is
final.
the
adjudication
of
the
validity
of
that
regulation
is
something
else,
but
why
is
that
any
less
final
than,
say,
a
change
in
the
federal
rules
that's
put
in
the
rule
books
but
that
hasn't
been
tested
in
an
adjudication?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
the
regulations,
the
underlying
regulations
here,
when
they
were
promulgated,
there
could
have
been
a
facial
challenge
to
the
regulations.
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
finality
issue
at
that
point,
would
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
position
is
that
an
interpretation
of
those
regulations...
those
regulations
we
agree
are
final
and
subject
to
a
facial
attack
within,
whatever,
60
days,
then
the
administrator
interprets
one
of
those
regulations.
that,
you
say,
the
interpretation
doesn't
become
final
until
there's
an
adjudication
of
the
correctness
of
the
interpretation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
mr.
bishop
concedes
that
he
could
have
gone
that
way,
that
his
client
could
have
chosen
that
route,
but
i
think
his
point
is
that
there
is
in
this
regime
no
counterpart
to,
say,
405(g)
and
(h)
of
the
social
security
legislation.
there
is
nothing
that
says,
and
this
is
the
only
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
say
that
that
takes
something
really
extraordinary
to
come...
to
use
an
extraordinary
writ
you
have
to
have...
because
your
argument...
tell
me
if
i
don't
grasp
it
correctly.
you've
got
two
points.
you
can
enter
the
court
1)
the
day
the
regulations
come
out.
you've
got
60
days
to
challenge
the
regulations.
after
that
the
administrative
process
is
it,
and
you
get
to
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
end
of
that
line.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
can--
