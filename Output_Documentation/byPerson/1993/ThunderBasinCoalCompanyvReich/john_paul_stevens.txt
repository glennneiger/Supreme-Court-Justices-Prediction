mr.
bishop,
i
just
was
a
little
unclear
from
the
papers,
the
mine
representative
is
the
union
itself
or
particular
individuals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
it
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
mine
safety
act
contemplate
an
organization
being
the...
having
this
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
a
little
incongruous
to
me.
i
thought
it
had
to
be
an
individual
walking
around
with
the
federal
inspector.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
mean
any
officer
of
the
union?
any
union
representative
could
perform
the
function
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
get
that
out
of
the
papers,
but
that's--
--in
your
view,
it
would
not
make
a
difference
if
it
had
been
only
the
two
individuals
who
are
professional
union
organizers,
you
would
have
the
same
objection
and
think
that
you
could
equally
come
into
the
district
court,
is
that...
do
i
understand
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bishop,
can
i
interrupt,
because
it's
through
your
brief,
now,
the
right
to
exclude
a
stranger
from
your
property
is
basically
a
state
law
right,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
gave
you
that
right.
it
merely
didn't
authorize
trumping
that
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
there
had
never
been
a
national
labor
relations
act,
you'd
have
exactly
the
same
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
not
relying
on
a
federal
statutory
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bishop,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question,
if
i
may.
there
are
really
two
different
views
between
you
and
your
opponents
on
what
the
mine
inspector
will
do.
on
the
one
hand
you
say
it
will
be
able
to
engage
in
organizing
activities,
look
at
records,
and
so
forth.
on
the
other
hand,
there's
this
letter
in
the
joint
appendix
that
your
opponent,
or
the
district
director
wrote
to
you
saying
he
really
can't
do
anything
that
we
won't
let
him
do.
which
view
of
his
authority
is
it
proper
for
us
to
assume
is
the
correct
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
you
have
that
demonstrates
that
what
this
exhibit
c
says
about
what
he'll
do
is
incorrect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
he
find
as
a
fact
that
these
mine
inspectors,
safety
inspectors
would
in
fact
engage
in
organizing
activities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean,
like,
talking
to
the
miners
and
sort
of
propagandizing
the
union,
or
just
finding
out
facts
that
will
be
useful
in
later...
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--under
your
view,
would
it
have
been
permissible
for
employees
to
designate
two
union
members
who
happened
to
also
be
interested
in
organizing
the
mine
to
be
the
mine
inspector,
but
they
were
employees?
i
assume
some
of
your
employees
may
be
union
members.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
might
do
exactly
the
same
thing
that
these
people
could
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
case
you're
referring
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
on
this...
can
you
help
me
understand
exhibit
9
in
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
at
page
29,
which
is
the
letter...
i
don't
know,
it's
unsigned,
but
i
gather
this
is
the
designation,
and
i
gather
it
was
sent
in
by
the
union,
and
it
names
about
half-a-dozen
or
more
people,
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
doesn't
say
the
union
itself...
your
adversary
said
that
the
union
was
one
of
the
representatives.
what
does
this
say?
how
many
representatives
are
there
in
this
case?
