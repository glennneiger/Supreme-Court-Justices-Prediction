mr.
wallace,
it's
possible,
is
it
not,
for
nonemployees
to
be
the
representatives?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
that
is
so,
suppose
there's
an
inspection
unannounced?
how
do
those
employee...
or,
how
do
those
representatives
get
notice?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wallace,
can
there
be
duplicate
designations?
can
there
be
duplicate
designations
by--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--then
what
happens?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
petitioner,
thunder
basin
coal
company,
is
what
its
name
implies
a
coal
mining
company.
its
workforce
is
non
union
but
that
force
designated
two
employees
of
the
united
mine
workers,
to
serve
as
miners'
representatives
under
a
statute,
which
is
in
30
u.s.
code
section
813(f).
the
company
refused
to
post
information
about
this
as
required
by
a
department
of
labor
regulation
and
instead
it
files
suit
in
district
court
and
obtained
an
injunction
preventing
the
enforcement
of
the
regulation.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
the
district
court
jurisdiction
was
precluded
by
the
administrative
review
scheme
of
the
mine
act,
which
provides
for
a
review
commission
and
then
further
review
by
the
appropriate
court
of
appeals.
the
company
contends
that
requiring
it
to
challenge
the
interpretation
to
the
statutory
review
procedures
violates
the
due
process
clause.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
mine
act's
review
scheme
precludes
a
district
court
from
exercising
subject-matter
jurisdiction
over
a
pre-enforcement
challenge
to
the
act.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
has
joined
therein
by
justice
thomas.
