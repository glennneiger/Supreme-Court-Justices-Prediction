mr.
wallace,
the...
you
said
in
the
brief
there's
an
explicit
designation
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
having
exclusive
jurisdiction.
it's
rather
a
curious
phrase
that
the
statute
uses.
it's
at
section
816,
paragraph
8,
page
31
of
your
appendix.
it
says,
upon...
it
says
that
"the
commission
shall
file
with
the
court
the
record
in
the
proceeding.
"
and
then
it
says,
"upon
such
filing
the
court
shall
have.
"
--that
is,
the
circuit
court...
"upon
such
filing,
the
court
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
proceeding.
"
it
would
seem
to
indicate
that
before
the
filing
there
can
be
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
some
other
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there's,
i
guess,
various
explanations
for
the
phrase.
it
indicates
that...
but
it's
rather
odd
to
use
the
phrase,
"upon
such
filing".
in
section
1331
we
don't
say,
upon
filing
there
should
be
jurisdiction,
because
obviously
there
can't
be
any
jurisdiction
until
something's
filed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
certainly
not
the
way
congress
usually
acts
when
it
purports
to
give
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
a
particular
court
or
set
of
courts.
