mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
federal
jurisdiction.
to
be
precise,
the
question
is
whether
a
federal
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
preenforcement
challenge
of
a
substantive
regulation
issued
by
the
mine
safety
&
health
administration.
the
case
is
not
here
on
the
merits.
the
case
was
decided
below
on
a
decision
by
federal
district
court
issuing
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
on
the
jurisdictional
grounds.
some
understanding
of
the
merits
of
what
the
case
is
about
is
essential
to
understand
the
basis
of
this
appeal
to
this
court.
what
the
case
is
about,
the
substance
of
it,
is
the
validity
of
a
substantive
regulation
issued
by
the
mine
safety
&
health
administration
that
deprived
the
mine
operator
of
its
right
to
exclude
nonemployee
union
organizers
from
its
premises.
the
decision
of
the
mine
safety
&
health
administration
in
this
respect
is
a
regulatory
decision.
it
was
an
interpretation
of
a
regulation
issued
by
msha
several
years
before.
the
case
was...
or
the
decision
was
applied
to
petitioner.
this
is
the
first
opportunity
the
petitioner
had
to
deal
with
the
issue.
the
question
here
before
this
court
is
whether
this
regulatory
interpretation
is
properly
reviewable
in
a
federal
district
court
on
a
preenforcement
challenge.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that's
right,
justice
souter.
the
precise
issue
here
was
not
decided
in
the
original
regulation.
the
original
regulation
was
a
broad.
the
precise
issue
here
of
whether
a
nonemployee
union
organizer
could
be
designated
as
a
miner's
representative
under
the
act
was
not
part
of
that
regulation.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
it
is
a
direct
challenge
to
the
regulation,
but
to
the
interpretation
of
the
regulation
rather
than
the
regulation
as
it
issued
at
the
time.
the
focus
on
the
issue
here
requires
a
little
bit
of
understanding
of
the
factual
background.
thunder
basin
is
a
mine
operation
in
wyoming.
it
is
a
nonunion
mine
operator.
the
mineworkers
union
has
tried
to
organize
the
mine,
unsuccessfully.
it
lost
an
nlrb
election
several
years
before.
the
united
mineworkers
in
1990
adopted
as
part
of
its
organizing
approach
a
tactic
using
section
813(f)
of
the
mine
act,
and
that
tactic
was
to
ask
employees
of
the
mine
to
designate
the
mineworkers
as
a
miner's
representative
under
the
act.
section
813(f)
of
the
act--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--it
can
be
the
union
or
particular
individuals.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
it
is
the...
the
designation
was
for
the
united
mineworkers
and
two
of
its
professional
organizers
who
are
not
employees
of
the
mine,
so
it's
a
dual
designation,
both
the
union
and
the
professional
organizers
for
the
union.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
unfortunately,
the
mine
act
is
not
clear
on
that,
your
honor,
and
the...,--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--that
is
the
practical
effect
of
it,
but
the
designation
was
approved
by
the
mine
safety
&
health
administration
as
the
designation
of
the
union
and
its
professional
employees.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
as
i
understand
the
way
the
mine
safety
&
health
administration
administers
the
act,
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
it
is...
that
is
a
procedure
that
is
available
under
the
act,
too,
is
a
procedure
that
the
mine
operator
here
chose
not
to
take
for
very
special
reasons.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
we
believe
that
the
statute
provides
that
opportunity,
and
this
court's
decision
in
abbott
laboratories
provides
the
basis
for
that
approach.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
and
we
think
it
should
have
been
interpreted
differently.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well,
i
don't...
my
understanding
of
abbott
labs
is
it
does
not
restrict
to
a
choice
of
a
regulation
that
was
not
subject
to
multiple
interpretations.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
there's
a
major
difference.
the
trilogy...
the
two
cases
where
preenforcement
challenges
were
allowed,
were
allowed
on
the
basis
of
ripeness,
which
i
think
is
the
point
that
we're
getting
to
here,
and
in
the
toilet
goods
v.
gardner
case,
the
court
found
the
case
was
not
ripe
yet.
the
reason
was
in
the
application
of
the
regulations.
in
the
two
cases,
abbott
and
the
other
toilet
goods
situation,
the
application
of
that
reg
caused
the
companies
to
have
to
undergo
a
change
in
business
practices.
they
had
to
do
things
immediately.
in
addition
to
that,
the
failure
to
follow
the
suggested
compliance
approach
would
subject
them
to
penalties
both
civil
and
criminal,
and
the
court
found
in
those
two
circumstances
that
this
was
sufficient
ripeness
for
the
action
to
happen.
under
the
toilet
goods...
gardner
v.
toilet
goods
case,
the
court
found
that
the
application
of
the
regulations
there
were
more
general.
they
were
not...
they
did
not
require
immediate
action.
the
regulations
were
phrased
in
the
turn
of
the
language,
"may",
rather
than
"shall".
the
application
was
not
felt
by
the
companies
immediately,
and
therefore
the
court
concluded
it
was
not
ripe,
while
the
other
two
cases
were.
in
our
situation,
this
was
a
very
ripe
decision.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well,
that's
the
first
thing
that
happens.
what
happens
after
that
is,
those
two
names
of
people
then
have
access
to
records
of
the
mine
that
they
would
not
have
access
to
before.
they
have
the
ability
to
participate
in
mine
inspection.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
even
if
the
records
are
available
for
safety
purposes,
justice
ginsburg,
it
causes
a
major
change
to
the--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
it's
speculation.
i
think
it's
real
life.
these
people
as
designated
representative
miners,
would
have
the
opportunity
that
they
do
not
have
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
two
respects.
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
more
than
40
years
has
had
two
major
principles,
1)...
it
has
many
principles,
but
two
that
relate
here:
1)
that
employees
or
nonemployees
who
are
union
organizers
can
be
excluded
from
the
premises
except
for
very
unusual
circumstances
not
presented
here.
second,
the
national
labor
relations
act
says
a
representative
of
employees
has
to
do
so
only
through
majority
representation.
what
happens
by
this
action
is,
the
mineworkers
have
an
advantage
that
they
don't
have
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
they
have
access
to
the
plant,
access
to
certain
records,
and
they
are
a
representative
of
employees,
get
to
actually
represent
them
in
matters
such
as
administrative
proceedings
before
msha
or
before
the
review--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--we
could
have,
and
the
reason
we
didn't,
your
honor,
is
because
we
were
subject
to
the
potential
of
losing
the
very
right
that
we
wanted
to
protect,
and
that
was
because,
in
a
case
that
occurred,
the
neighboring
mine
to
thunder
basin,
just
2
months
before,
msha
approached
the
failure
to
post
the
designation
and
said,
we
will
issue
a
citation,
and
we
will
fine
you
maximum
daily
penalties...
at
that
time
$1,000
a
day,
now
$5,000
a
day...
if
you
do
not
post
it.
under
that
circumstance,
a
mine
operator
cannot
go
through
the
review
commission
and
run
its
risk
on
3
or
4
years
of
litigation.
that
case
is
now
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
in
that
case,
kerr-mcgee
mine
capitulated.
they
obeyed
it.
they
allowed
the
posting,
and
have
challenged
their
legal
right
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
thunder
basin
did
not
want
to
capitulate.
it
believed
its
right
was
a
valid
right.
it's
been
on
the
books
for
more
than
40
years--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
yes.
the
cost
to
thunder
basin,
if
they
had
been
subject
to
$5,000
a
day,
which
was--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--well,
your
honor,
we're
dealing
with
something
more
than
monetary
cost.
we're
dealing
with
a
very
important
cost
to
thunder
basin,
and
that
is
the
cost
of
having
to
abandon
a
very
important
right.
this
company
has
the
right
under
the
labor
laws
as
interpreted
by
this--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--it's
a
common
law--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--it's
a
common
law
property
right,
and
in
some
cases
a
state--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
well,
we
think
we
are.
it's
not
a
right
that
has
been
written
in
an
act
of
congress.
however,
over
the
40
years
that
this
issue
has
been
debated
legally
and
in
congress,
it
has
always
been
upheld.
this
court--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--it
certainly
is,
but
four
times
this
court,
that
i
can
recall,
and
i
think
there
were
other
cases,
has
discussed
this
employer's
right
in
the
context
of
the
full
reach
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
it
has
declined
and
refused
to
allow
the
other
interests
under
the
labor
laws
to
cause
diminution
of
that
right.
it
is
now
very
much
a
part
of
the
fabric
of
the
labor
laws.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
your
honor,
i
think
after
the
many
cases
that
that
this
court
has
looked
at
that
right,
and
looked
at
the
many
opportunities
and
arguments
to
weaken
that
right
because
of
other
advantages
or
opportunities
or
necessities
created
under
the
labor
laws,
that
this
right
now
is
a
recognized
part
of
the
full
rights
under
the
labor
laws.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
it
becomes
part
of
the
statutory
scheme.
if
it's
not
part
of
the
congressional
law,
it
is
part
of
the
statutory
scheme.
what
we're
talking
about
here--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
draw
it
that
starkly.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
the
only
answer
i
can
give
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it
becomes
part
of
the
framework
and
the
fabric
of
the
statutory
scheme.
it
is
a
part,
a
recognized
part
of
what
we
call
our
labor
laws.
this
court
has
affirmed
that
on
four
recent
occasions,
and
all
the
way
back
to
1956.
it
is
not
a
statutory
right,
but
it
is
certainly
a
recognized
right
in
the
scheme
of
the
labor
laws
and
how
it's
affected.
what
we
have
here--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--i
don't
think
so.
the
issue
here
is
the
validity
of
the
right
to
exclude--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--well,
no,
it
is.
what
i
mean
by
my
response,
justice
souter,
is
this.
if
it
were
not
for
the
existence
of
the
right
to
exclude
union
organizers...
nonemployee
organizers...
from
the
premises,
the
company's
situation
would
have
been
that
the
abatement
cost
were
very
small,
and
it
would
not
have
been
faced
with
the
daily
penalty.
in
other
words,
it
would
have
litigated
the
issue
before
the
review
commission,
but
the
cost
of
having
to
give
up
its
right
to
exclude
the
union
organizers
is
the
major
cost
here.
that
is
the
cost
that
causes
the
company
to
fight,
to
go
to
seek
preenforcement
challenge
in
court.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
we
don't
think
the
damages
or
the
cost
would
be
sufficiently
great
to
justify
it.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
justice
scalia,
that--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--justice
scalia,
that's
not
totally
correct.
the
statute,
the
operative
statutory
section
here,
section
814(a),
provides
that
when
the
mine
safety
health
administration
investigates
and
finds
that
a
rule
or
regulation
or
an
order
of
it
is
not
being
adhered
to,
it
must...
the
statute
says
shall...
issue
a
citation.
there
is
a
certainty
of
a
citation
here.
what
follows
the
citation
at
that
point
is
the
msha
representative
comes
out
again
and
says,
we've
issued
the
citation,
have
you
posted
that
notice
yet?
if
thunder
basin
says
no,
we
have
not
posted
it
yet,
they
say,
well,
we
will
give
you
x
amount
of
days
or
hours...
what
they
suggested
to
kerr-mcgee
was
24
hours...
to
post
that
notice,
otherwise
we
will
proceed
on
a
penalty
case
of
this
amount.
so
it
is
a--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--does
the...
does
the
agency?
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
yes.
the
agency
has
an
injunctive
relief
statute
that
congress
gave
them.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
the
statute
says
that
msha
must
issue
the
citation.
whether
it
then
wishes--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--after
the
citation,
what
normally
happens
is
that
they
proceed
to
go
through
the
review
commission
authorized--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--i
think
what
they
would
do,
if
they
want
to
use--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--i'm
not
sure
what
their
answer
is,
is
my
hesitancy,
but
i
think
they
have...
the
circumstance
is
i
think
they
would
do
both.
they
would
proceed
through
the
review
commission,
but
if
the
issue
was
sufficiently
important,
like
something
that
endangered
the
health
of
employees
on
an
immediate
basis,
they
would
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
federal
district
court
to
get
a
temporary
injunction
against
the
practices.
we
don't
have
an
issue
here
that
compels,
or
anything
like
that.
we
have
a
statutory
construction
issue,
a
legal
issue.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
depends
on
the
designee.
they
have
the
right
to
initiate,
or
suggest
initiation
of
proceedings.
if
there's
an
inspection
at
the
mine,
they
proceed
with
the
mine
inspector.
they
walk
around
the
mine.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
there
are
four
inspections
a
year,
and
there
are
other
reports
that
have
to
be
submitted
by
the
mine
operator.
the
mine
representative
has
access
to
those
reports,
has
access
to
anything
that
relates
to
safety
and
health
that
is
involved
in
the
functions
of
the
miner's
representatives.
they
are
fully
able,
fully
involved
in
the
mine
safety
aspects.
that's
what
congress
intended,
except
what
congress
was
focusing
on
was
having
mine
employees
be
involved.
congress
did
not
address
the
issue
of
nonemployees.
it
certainly
did
not...
and
that's
a--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
key
to
understanding
that
is
to
be
in
a
position
of
a
mine
operator.
the
mine
operator
has
a
right,
under
our
laws,
if
he
acts
legally,
to
be
nonunion,
to
operate
nonunion.
what
is
happening
here
by
this
opportunity,
an
advantage
is
being
given
to
the
united
mineworkers
that
is
not
available
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
mine
operator
wishes
very
sincerely
to
be
a
good
employer
who
is
nonunion.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
the
difference,
your
honor,
are
two
things.
one
is
that
by
the
action
taken
by
the
mine
safety
&
health
administration,
they
are
trying
to
repudiate
a
legal
right
that
the
employer
has.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
under
state
law,
if
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
it's
broader.
in
addition,
what
has
happened
here
is
the
mine
safety
&
health
administration
has
used
a
tactic
that
is
essentially
very,
very
coercive
to
force
the
mine
operator
to
give
up
that
right
before
a
hearing,
and
that's
what
makes
this
case
different.
i
also
believe
that
abbott
labs
stands
for
the
principle
that
if
the
statute
does
not
precisely
preclude
preenforcement
review...
i'm
sorry,
let
me
rephrase
that,
because
i
went
too
far
with
it.
if
the
intention
of
congress
is
not
clear
that
congress
wanted
to
preclude
preenforcement
challenges,
then
the
preenforcement
challenges--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--abbott
laboratories.
abbott
says
very
precisely
that
it
picks
up
the
presumption
of
review
decisions--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--well,
justice--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--there
are
two
parts
to
the
abbott
decision.
part
1
is,
did
congress
preclude
preenforcement
challenges?
abbott
said
if
congress
did
not
preclude
preenforcement
challenges,
then
the
presumption
of
review
is
available.
point
2,
abbott
said,
is
this
case
justiciable
under
traditional
principles
of
jurisdiction,
and
that
is
the
proposition
that
you're
talking
about
here.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
it's
completely
consistent
with
whitney.
i
think
whitney
stands
for
the
proposition
that
an
administrative
agency
has
certain
expertise,
and
when
congress
prescribes
an
approach
to
go
through
that
administrative
agency,
the
parties
are
mandated
to
do
it.
here,
the
statute
does
not
preclude
preenforcement
challenges.
i
think
abbott
and
whitney
are
totally
consistent.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
the
difference
is
that
in
whitney,
the
court,
after
thorough
analysis,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
intend
this
as
the
only
route.
we
say,
based
on--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--you're
correct,
it
was
not
explicit,
but
from
the
statutory
scheme,
that
was
the
decision,
so--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--obviously,
we
think
our
view
is
appropriate,
for
this
reason.
it
is
the
very--
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
--no,
your
honor.
that
was
litigated
on
the
decision
on
the
merits
by
the
district
court
judge,
who
granted
the
permanent
injunction.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
not
that
they
would
engage
in
organizing
activities,
but
that
the
potential
was
high,
and
the
opportunity
was
presented
for
them
to
do
that.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
both
of
those,
and
the
imprimatur
of
government
authority
placed
on
the
mineworkers
union
by
being
allowed
into
the
plant
with
the
federal
government,
that's
a
substantial
impact
on
the
will
of
the
voter
if
it
comes
to
an
nlra
election.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that
is
totally
permissible.
there's
no
legal
argument
against
that.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we'd
have
no
legal
argument
against
that.
mr.
wayne
s.
bishop
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
the
agency
action
here...
you
have
to
recognize
that
the
statute
looked
at
two
different
areas,
regulations,
and
enforcement.
msha
has
responsibility
for
regulations.
this
was
the
final
decision
of
msha.
msha
has,
under
the
regulation
here,
delegated
to
the
district
manager
the
responsibility
under
part
40
of
the
cfr
reg
here.
the
district
manager
is
the
one
who
made
the
decision
here,
but
even
then
the
district
manager
consulted
at
a
higher
level
before
he
finalized
it,
but
this
is
final
agency
action.
under
the
harrison
case
of
this
court,
harrison
v.
ppg,
this
court
says
that
final
agency
action
is
the
final
word
of
the
agency
short
of
enforcement,
and
that's
where
we
are.
thank
you
very
much.
