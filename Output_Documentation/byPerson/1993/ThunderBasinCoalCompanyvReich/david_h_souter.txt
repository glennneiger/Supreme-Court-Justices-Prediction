justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
there's
no
way
they
could
have
challenged
this
regulation
prior
to
the
proposed
enforcement
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
then,
are
they
in
fact
challenging
the
regulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
bishop,
if
the
only
cost
to
you
were
the
monetary
cost,
would
you
be
making
the
argument
for
review
that...
would
you
be
claiming
the
right
to
review
that
you
now
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
$5,000
a
day
essentially
is
not
your
argument,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
don't
take
the
position
that
every
time
you
want
to
challenge
an
administrative
interpretation
and
there
is
a
running
daily
cost
against
it,
that
therefore
a
corporation
such
as
yours
should
in
effect
have
the
nonspecifically
statutory
review
opportunity
that
you're
seeking.
you
don't
take
that
broad
position,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
must
they
proceed
on
the
penalty
case?
do
they
then
have
the
option
to
go
into
district
court
as
opposed
to
proceeding
through
administrative
penalty?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
agency,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
not
certain
that
it
would
proceed
by
means
of
administrative
penalty
rather
than
action
in
the
district
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
what
happens
after
the
citation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is
not
mandated
by
statute.
they
could
go
to
district
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
legally
they
could,
couldn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wallace,
in
terms
of
where
it
is
now,
you
used
the
phrase
a
moment
ago
that
the
agency
had
advised
the
thunder
basin
that,
i
think,
as
you
put
it,
these
individuals
are
eligible.
has
the
agency
actually
given
a
final
designation
to
these
individuals?
justice
david
h.
souter
who
does?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
agency...
does
the
agency
have
a
formal
act
of
recognizing
the
miners'
choice?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
just
show
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me,
the
agency
doesn't
do
anything,
the
day
comes,
and
somebody
just
gets
on
the
phone
and
say,
let's
go
over
to
the
mine?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
somewhere
in
the
records
of
the
agency,
there
must
be
some...
there
must
be
some
administrative
act
along
the
lines...
along
the
following
lines.
the
miners
have
designated
or
nominated
the
following
individuals,
and
we
recognize
that
designation,
we
accept
that
designation.
isn't
there
some
such
act
as
that,
and
if
there
is,
has
that
been
done
yet?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
should
be
done
under
the
statute,
regardless
of
what's
in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
even
go
through
the
agency?
the
employers
get
in
touch
with
the
owners
directly?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
see,
so
that
in
effect
is
the
reason
for
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
that
the
agency
doesn't
do
anything
final
until
it
issues
a
citation.
