unknown
speaker
how
rare
is
rare,
mr.
dumont?
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
says
it
seems
to
happen
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
of
those
7
percent
are
"true
doubt"
cases,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
was...
go
ahead.
well,
i'm
just
pursuing
that.
one
alj
seems
to
have
found
"true
doubt"
in
four
cases
in
one
year,
complete
equipoise
of
the
evidence,
which
one
would
think
would
be
extraordinary.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
figures
for
the
rarity
under
the
longshore
workers'
act
comparable
to
the
black
lung
benefits?
is
it
the
same?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
that
is
your
definition
of
very
rare,
7
or
8
percent
of
the
cases.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dumont,
what
is
the
standard
of
review
of
the
alj
on
whether
or
not
it
was
correct
to
say
the
evidence
was
in
equipoise?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
alj
says
there's
equipoise
and
there
is
some
evidence
on
both
sides,
that
that
will
be
accepted?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
reliance
there,
i
take
it,
on
any
administrative
regulation.
unknown
speaker
so
the
court
of
appeals
simply
upheld
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
under
what
legislation
was
this?
unknown
speaker
and
who
was
the
suit
against,
it
was
against
an
employer?
unknown
speaker
but
the
pocket
was
not
the
government's
pocket;
it
was
an
employer's
pocket
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
counterpart
for
any
state
workers'
compensation
schemes?
it
was
not
clear
from
the
brief
whether
this
is
simply
under
the
federal
programs,
black
lung
benefits
and
worker...
and
the
longshore
act.
in
state
workers'
compensation
laws,
in
their
administration,
does
any
state
system
have
a
"true
doubt"
rule?
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
suggestion,
i
think,
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
no
state
does.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
was
it
court
of
appeal?
i
thought
you
said
the
secretary
had
established
the
principle.
did
the
court
of
appeal
establish
it
or
did
it
simply
accept
the
secretary's
enunciation
of
it?
unknown
speaker
right,
okay.
so
the
courts
didn't
develop
this.
it
was
developed
by
the
agency,
and
you're
telling
us
that
the
courts
had
accepted
it.
unknown
speaker
don't
some
people
attribute
it
to
the
d.c.
circuit
back
in
1932?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
theory
for
squaring
718.403
of
20
cfr,
which
says
that
the
burden
of
proving
a
fact
alleged
in
connection
with
any
provision
of
this
part
shall
rest
with
the
party
making
the
allegation?
is
your
theory
that
that
is
a
general
statement
and
that's
superseded
by
the
more
specific
provisions
of
718.3(c)?
unknown
speaker
it's
odd
to
talk
about
the
burden
of
going
forward
in
the
context
of
burden
of
proving
effect.
that's
a
very
odd
use
for
a
phrase
that's
intended
to
apply
simply
to
the
burden
of
going
forward.
unknown
speaker
we
didn't
hold
that.
we
said
it
in
a
footnote
in
a
dictum,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
we
could
follow
a
rule
of
general
application
that
law
is
not
made
in
footnotes,
that
holdings
are
not
stated
in
footnotes?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
so
important,
why
is
it
in
a
footnote?
unknown
speaker
well,
then...
but
then
doesn't
your
argument
that
it
was
a
holding
fall
apart,
if
it
wasn't
essential?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
to
draw
something
out
of
what
is
the
third
sentence
in
a
footnote
and
say
this
is
what
decides
the
case
is
extraordinary.
unknown
speaker
which
hadn't
been
cited
by
the
parties.
indeed,
the
parties
in
the
case
had
not
even
made
the
argument
that
appears
in
the
footnote.
the
briefs
in
the
case
did
not
assert
that
section
706
applied
only
to
burden
of
production.
it
came
out
of
nowhere.
i
don't
understand
where
the
footnote
came
from.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
they
did.
not
as
it
appears
in
the
footnote,
that
the
whole
section...
but
let's
talk
about
the
section.
why
do
you
say...
never
mind
the
footnote;
let's
look
at
the
section.
what
does
it
say?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
does
say
"the
proponent
of
a
rule
or
order.
"
now,
in
an
ordinary
proceeding
who
is
that?
would
it
not
be
the
claimant
who
wants
the
board
to
order
payment?
unknown
speaker
or
perhaps
he's
an
opponent
of
the
order.
unknown
speaker
but
does
that
language
suggest
that
that's
all
that
it
means?
i
mean,
you
really
assert
that
when
you
speak
of
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
that
the
normal
meaning
of
that
is
not
burden
of
persuasion?
unknown
speaker
it
can...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
legislative
history
you
refer
to
can
be
explained
as
simply
addressing
the
only
part
of
the
first
sentence
that
might
be
ambiguous,
whether
it
referred,
in
addition
to
the
burden
of
proof,
also
to
the
burden
of
persuasion.
but--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
think
it's
not
incoherent
to
read
section
7(c)...
the
third
sentence,
you
assert,
establishes
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
rule,
right?
it
says
that:
"a
sanction
may
not
be
imposed
or
rule
or
order
issued
except
on
consideration
of
the
whole
record
or
those
parts.
"
of
it,
"and
supported
by
and
in
accordance
with
the
reliable,
probative,
and
substantial
evidence.
"
that's
essentially
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
rule,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
congress
is
shaking
its
finger
at
the
agencies
and
saying
you
must...
proof
must
be
made
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
in
the
first
sentence
it
says
but,
of
course,
you
can
put
the
burden
of
establishing
that
preponderance
on
any
side
you
want.
what
kind
of
a
restriction
is
that
on
the
agencies?
it's
none
at
all.
unknown
speaker
i
find
that
so
extraordinary,
to
think
that
congress
is
going
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
establishing
a
preponderance
rule
and
say
anybody
in
the
world
can
be
given
the
burden
of
carrying
the
preponderance.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
ordinarily
it
does
tell
you.
it
says
the
party
upon
whom
the
burden
of
proof
is
placed
fails
if
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
you
get
this
distinction?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
comes
out
of
the
apa.
unknown
speaker
when
was
718.403
adopted,
the
regulation
that
justice
kennedy
inquired
about?
unknown
speaker
as
a
response
to
the
enactment
by
congress
of
the
black
lung
program?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
it
have
a
predecessor
in
hhs,
the
reg,
718.403?
unknown
speaker
and
was
there
any
comment
in
connection
with
its
adoption,
by
the
secretary
at
the
time
of
its
adoption?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
7...
is
718.493,
is
that
the
regulation
you
rely
on
to
say
that
the
secretary's
conduct
here
was
justified,
that
it
supports
the
"true
doubt"
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
regulation
is
it?
unknown
speaker
718.3(c).
unknown
speaker
and
what
does
that
say?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
certainly
support
the
use
of
the
"true
doubt"
rule
the
way
it
was
used
in
this
case,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
very
vague
about
embodies
the
intent
of
the
"true
doubt"
rule.
certainly
this
is
remarkably
imprecise,
if
that's
your
principal
basis
of
reliance.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dumont,
is
the
burden
of
proof
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
do
you
suppose?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
i'm
not
sure
it's
even
open
to
regulatory
change,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
except
its
incorporation
of
the
apa,
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
meaning
of
the
apa.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're
right
about
your
first
interpretation,
that
the
statute...
assuming
the
statute
doesn't
speak
to
it
and
7(c)
is
only
production
burden,
are
you
saying
that
every
agency
that
doesn't
have
a
specific
statutory
allocation
of
the
persuasion
burden
can
decide
for
itself
whether
to
have
a
"true
doubt"
rule
or
require
preponderance,
so
it's
totally
the
agency's
option?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
agencies
are
in
this
situation,
they
have
no
explicit
statutory
allocation
of
the
persuasion
burden
and
so
they
have
only
7(c),
which
you
say
is
only
the
burden
of
coming
forward?
unknown
speaker
counselor,
your
position
is
that
if
a
statute
says
"except
as
provided
by
statute,
the
rule
shall
be
x.
"
and
there's
another
statute
that
says
"agencies
may
promulgate
regulations
in
accordance
with
the
purposes
of
this
act.
"
that
the
latter
overcomes
the
former.
i
find
that
an
extraordinary
contention.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes.
you
say
except
as
provided...
otherwise
provided
by
statute
can
be
overcome
by
another
statute
which
says
an
agency
can
promulgate
a
rule.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
authority
for
a
case
which
imposes
a
similar
analysis
and
comes
to
a
similar
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
solomons,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
do
have
something
to
look
at
in
that
footnote
in
transportation
management.
it's
not
new
with
this
litigation,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
for
your
to
prevail
do
we
have
to
disavow
that
footnote?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
just
to
say
that
the
decision
was
right
in
the
case.
it's
not
to
say
that
the
sentence,
which
we're
focusing
on,
was
right.
you're
going
to
spend
an
awful
lot
of
your
argument
explaining
why
that
sentence
is
right,
if
you
insist
on
saying
we
don't
have
to
repudiate
it.
it's
a
lot
easier
to
explain
why
we
should
repudiate
it,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
they've
taken
it
out
of
context,
all
you
mean
is
that
the
case
should
have
been
decided
that
way
anyway,
but
not
on
the
ground...
surely
not
on
the
ground
that
the
section
in
question
involves
only
the
burden
of
production,
rather
than
the
burden
of
persuasion.
unknown
speaker
we
used
the
same
usage...
the
court
did
in
the
ward's
cove
opinion,
didn't
it,
in
describing
the
so-called
burden
of
proof
on
the
business
justification?
they
said
that
was
just
a
burden
of
going
forward.
unknown
speaker
so
the
footnote
doesn't
seem
to
be
unique,
i
guess
is
the
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't,
but
the
terms
that
it's
using
are
common
terms
and
we're
still
talking
about
burden
of
proof.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
it
make
much
sense
for
this
court
to
have
interpreted
the
first
sentence
when,
in
the
very
same
section,
the
ultimate
control,
as
you
say,
is
the
third
sentence?
that
wouldn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense,
to
have
a
footnote
that
says,
well,
this
is
what
the
first
sentence
says,
but
that
is
going...
that
initial
impression
is
going
to
be
contradicted
by
the
third
sentence.
unknown
speaker
but,
in
any
event,
we...
i
think
that
we
can
agree
that
the
government
didn't
make
up
its
position
for
this
case.
we're
told
in
the
briefs...
and
i
don't
think
you
question
it...
that
the
"true
doubt"
notion
has
been
around
since
the
thirties,
since
that
burris
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
in
other
words,
on
an
issue
of
statutory
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
what
practical
difference
is
there
between
the
kind
of
standard
you
say
the
courts
did
apply
and
the
"true
doubt"
rule?
unknown
speaker
nothing
to
do
with
what?
unknown
speaker
oh,
tied
like
it
counts
for
running,
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
it
applied
and
interpreted?
i
mean,
if
the
claimant
puts
on
a
minimum
amount
of
evidence
and
there
is
substantial
evidence
on
the
other
side,
is
deference
given
on
appellate
review
to
the
initial
fact
finder's
determination
that
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise,
even
though
the
appellate
reviewer
might
not
have
thought
it
could
be
in
equipoise?
unknown
speaker
almost
always
what?
unknown
speaker
how,
how
could
a
reviewing
court
determine
that
the
evidence
was,
in
fact,
in
equipoise,
when
it
is
not
even
permitted
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
preponderance?
i
mean,
in
the
ordinary
case
where
the
agency
is
applying
a
preponderance
standard,
the
appellate
court
doesn't
review
to
see
whether
there
really
was
a
preponderance;
it
just
reviews
to
see
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence.
so
it
seems
to
me
quite
impossible
for
a
reviewing
court
to
determine
whether
there
was
really
an
equipoise.
all
it
could
say
is
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
on
one
side.
unknown
speaker
well,
we're
told
that
the
figure
is
under
10
percent,
so
it's
not
case
after
case
after
case.
under
the
black
lung
act,
that
that
was
a
figure
for
total
plaintiffs...
claimants'
recoveries,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
contesting
that
on
these
records,
the
fact
finder
could
have
found
for
the
claimant
by
a
preponderance.
and
the
third
circuit
said
that
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
for
the
alj
to
make
that
ultimate
decision,
so
the
third
circuit
must
have
felt
there
was
enough
evidence
for
a
fact
finder
to
find
the
preponderance
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
in
that
connection,
mr.
solomons,
do
you
contend
that
20
crf
718.3(c)
is
invalid?
unknown
speaker
indeed,
if
you
follow
its
plain
language,
they
would
have
to
apply
a--
unknown
speaker
--a
criminal
standard
to
the
employer.
he
would
have
to
show
that
he's
not
liable
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
narrow
argument
under
the
black
lung
act
that...
under
718.403,
the
issue
is
an
issue
of
the
administer...
of
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
department's
own
regulations.
and
if
they
may
reasonably
interpret
the
reg
as
being
simply
a
production
reg,
rather
than
a
burden
of
persuasion
reg,
that
there
certainly
isn't
any
conflict
between
that
and
the
"true
doubt"
rule,
and
that
therefore
that
ought
to
dispose
of
the
black
lung
case
which
is
before
us
here.
unknown
speaker
which
turns
the
argument
into
the
invalidity
of
the
regulation
as
the
secretary
construes
it,
in
other
words.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solomons,
can
i
go
back
to
the
regulation?
i
must
confess
that
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
either
you
or
justice
scalia's
comment.
because
it
says
that
all
reasonable
doubt
shall
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
claimant;
it
doesn't
have
any
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
it.
and
i
was
just
wondering
why
is
not
true
doubt
when
the
evidence
is
in
perfect
equipoise
a
species
of
reasonable
doubt?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
suppose
that...
if
the
hearing
officer
just
does...
can't
make
up
his
mind
and
a
reasonable
judge
couldn't,
wouldn't
you
say
that
he
has
reasonable
doubt
about
the
outcome?
unknown
speaker
the
rest
of
the
regulations
require
to
read
burden
of
proof
to
mean
burden
of
persuasion
which,
of
course,
is
not
an
unreasonable
reading.
but
isn't
that
what
you're
referring
to
in
the
rest
of
the
regulations?
unknown
speaker
indeed.
i
thought
your
point
was
that
the
third
sentence
of
718.3(c)
itself
contradicts
that
reading
of
the
first
sentence,
since
it
goes
on
to
say
notwithstanding
what
we
said
in
the
first
sentence,
you
don't
make
an
award
unless
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
awarding
it.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
not
a
reasonable
basis
to
say,
well,
we
really
can't
tell
whether
there's
a
reasonable
basis.
unknown
speaker
because
they
require
a
prima
facie
case.
unknown
speaker
they
require
a
prima
facie
case,
and
were
only
concerned
that
the
employer
meets
the
case
with
evidence
of
equal
weight.
it
would
have
been
a
reasonable
basis
if
there
had
been
no
defense
put
out;
that's
the
way
they
read
that.
unknown
speaker
are
you
referring
to
the
so-called
"true
doubt"
rule?
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
first
find
the
words
"true
doubt"
used
to
describe
this
rule
that
is
being
supported
here
by
the
government?
unknown
speaker
can't
disagree
with
that,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
maybe
the
agency's
just
being
too
honest.
i
mean,
what
goes
on
in
many
administrative
programs
in
the
state,
i
gather,
which
are
set
up
to
benefit
these
workers,
is
that
if
it's
close,
in
fact
the
decision
maker
will
just
say
we'll
apply
this,
in
effect,
and
say
in
close
cases
i'll
find
a
preponderance
in
favor
of
the
worker.
and
you'd
have
no
problem
with
that.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
take
it
on
appeal,
and
on
appeal--
unknown
speaker
--the
court
would
look
at
it
and
it
would
reweigh
and
it'd
just
say,
well,
there's
some
substantial
evidence
favoring
the
claimant
and
we
have
a
generous
decision
here;
we'll
let
it
stand.
unknown
speaker
you're
used
to
getting
bad
calls,
but
not
used
to
its
being
admitted,
is
that
it?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
why
do
you
say
that...
you're
saying
that
if
the
administrative
law
judge
doesn't
like
the
party.
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
you
know,
supposing
that
you're
talking
about
a
court
case
and
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
a
plaintiff
has
to
prove
his
side
of
the
case
by
a
preponderance,
but
congress
steps
in
and
says
well
in
this
particular
kind
of
case
you've
got
to
prove
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
well,
surely,
that
doesn't
make
all
plaintiffs
mad
that
they've
been
told
they
have
to
meet
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position
before
you
sit
down,
on
the
section
7(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
do
you
disagree
with
the
interpretation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
footnote?
unknown
speaker
but,
now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
in
any
administrative
proceeding
in
which
the
defendant
or
respondent
has
an
affirmative
defense,
that
the
agency
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
that
the
affirmative
defense
is
insufficient?
unknown
speaker
the
statute,
if
you
read
it
as
burden
of
persuasion,
says
the
proponent
of
the
order
has
the
burden
of
persuasion.
you
don't
read
it
that
literally?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
solomons.
mr.
dumont,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
mention
the
word
"true
doubt",
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
respondent's
contention
was
that
the
so-called
"true
doubt"
rule
is
kind
of
putting
a
label
on
something
that
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
while.
unknown
speaker
mcgraw
was
before
the
apa,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
rule
could...
may
have
been
okay
before
then.
unknown
speaker
didn't
an
earlier
version
of
section
7(c)
read
"the
proponent
of
a
rule
or
order
shall
have
the
burden
of
proceeding
except
as
statutes
otherwise
provide.
"
and
that
was
changed
in
the
final
version
to
"burden
of
proof"?
unknown
speaker
did
not
eliminate
the
burden
of
proceeding.
