mr.
mark
e.
solomons
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
"true
doubt"
rule
is
not
some
policy
that's
based
on
fairness
and
experience;
it's
an
arbitrary
and
opportunistic
principle
that
has
come
to
this
court
in
search
of
a
justification,
on
the
basis
of
a
theory
that
was
developed,
i
think,
exclusively
for
this
litigation.
there
is
no
valid--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--well,
i
think
the
footnote
in
transportation
management,
in
their
argument,
is
taken
out
of
its
context.
if
you
read
that
last
sentence
in
the
footnote,
it
certainly
does
say
that
section
7(c)
imposes
only
a
burden
of
production,
but
that's
not
right
because
section
7(c)
does
a
myriad
of
things.
it's
a
whole
instruction
book.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
no,
i
don't
have
to
disavow
the
footnote.
the
footnote,
in
context,
says
that
that
first
sentence
imposes
a
burden
of
production.
i
think
that
section
7(c),
in
its
totality,
also
imposes
a
burden
of
persuasion,
as
well
as
a
burden
of
production.
it
carries
through
the
proceedings
by
providing...
it
provides
guides
to
the
administrative
law
judge
on
how
to
conduct
the
proceedings,
how
to
find
facts,
and
how
to
do
the
things
that
the
administrative
law
judge
has
to
do.
and
what
it
says
is
that
if
there
are
facts
to
be
found,
administrative
law
judge,
then
they
must
be
supported
by
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
it
does
not
trouble
me
at
all,
and
i
hope
it
doesn't
trouble
the
court,
that
when
a
party,
as
was
the
case
in
transportation
management,
put
new
facts
into
play
in
the
form
of
an
affirmative
defense,
that
the
administrative
law
judge
there
also
was
required,
if
the
facts
were
to
be
found,
to
find
them,
if
they
were
in
accordance
with
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
it's
easy
to
explain
how
you
should
repudiate
it,
but
they've
taken
it
out
of
context
in
making
the
argument
that's
based
on
it.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
sense.
i
don't
think
that
it--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--i
do
not
believe
that
section
7(c)
involves
only
the
burden
of
production.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
reach
that
conclusion,
reading
it
or
reading
the
materials
that
are
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
apa.
it
simply
doesn't
say
that.
that
is
a
restrictive
and
narrow
reading
which
does
not
gain
any
support
from
either
the
provision
itself
or
from
the
legislative
history
or
from
any
normal,
ordinary,
common
usage
of
those
kinds
of
provisions.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--no,
i
don't
think
that
it...
it
may
not
be
unique,
but
that's
not
an
administrative
procedure
act
case,
as
i
recall.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
yes.
and
i
think
that
what
you
will
find
in
the
jurisprudence
is
that
occasionally
the
terms
"burden
of
proof"
are
used
to
mean
only
burden
of
production,
but
i
think
rarely.
and
in
certain
circumstances
the
terms...
the
term
"burden
of
proof"
is
meant
to
encompass
the
whole
fact-finding
process.
i
think
the
more
natural
reading
of
it
is
to
encompass
the
whole
fact-finding
process.
but
i
think
that
it
is
not
necessary,
in
the
context
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
to
get
too
much
involved
in
that
first
sentence
only.
because
even
in
the
legislative
materials,
they
say
you
must
read
all
of
these
provisions
together.
if
you
read
all
of
the
provisions
together,
then
i
think
it
becomes
clear
that
they
mean
by
burden
of
proof...
they
mean
burden
of
persuasion,
because
they
said
it
two
sentences
later.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
justice
ginsburg,
you're
right.
the
problem,
i
think,
in
this
case
was
that
it
was
not...
was
the
way
it
was
briefed.
i
have
reviewed
the
briefs
in
transportation
management,
and
although
the
case
comes
after
this
court's
decision
in
steadman,
which
i
think
explains
all
of
this
very
clearly,
steadman
wasn't
mentioned.
the
government
does
not
argue
what
it
argues
here.
the
government
argued
in
their
briefs
in
that
case
that
this
was
an
affirmative
defense
and
it
was
perfectly
fine
to
have
those
facts
introduced
and
to
place
the
burden,
if
it
was
the
agency's
choice
to
do
that,
on
the
party
that
was
the
proponent
of
those
facts.
that's
precisely
what
they
argued.
i
think
it
was
a
failure
of
advocacy
in
that
case,
not
a
fully
informed
footnote,
perhaps.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
i
take
issue
with
that.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
the
"true
doubt"
notion,
that
is
this
kind
of
non...
the
rule
of
nonpersuasion,
is
pretty
new.
i
think
it
probably
first
emerged
in
a
department
of
labor
brief
within
the
last
year.
it
is
certainly
true
that
for
many
years
there
was
a
principle,
and
it's
a
principle
that
still
exists,
that
when
interpreting
these
remedial
statutes
where
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute
that
cannot
be
resolved
in
some
natural
way,
that
you
may
resolve
it
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
yes.
and
i
believe
that
in
the
early
cases
that
the
department
is
referring
to,
you
will
never
see...
certainly
never
see
the
words
"true
doubt".
you
will
never
see
an
analysis
from
those
courts
that
looks
anything
like
what
you
have
in
the
briefs
here.
what
you
will
see
is
a
situation
where
the
employer
has
gone
in
in
the
face
of
some
proof,
and
argued
on
appeal,
under
the
substantial
evidence
standard,
that
the
claimant
didn't
prove
to
some
very
substantial
degree
that
he
should
have
been
awarded
benefits.
and
the
courts
are
saying,
well,
he
doesn't
have
to
do
it
to
that
degree;
these
are
remedial
statutes.
and
in
some
of
the
other
cases...
these
are
simply
embellishments
on
the
substantial
evidence
review,
in
those
cases.
if
you
want
to
find--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--well,
i
think
that
the
standard
that
the
courts
did
apply
in
those
other
cases
has
nothing
to
do
with
tied
evidence.
i
think
it
has--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--tied
evidence.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
right.
what
we
have...
the
rule
that
we're
talking
about,
i
think
first
emerges
in
a
1968
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
then
it's
reiterated...
this
is
with
any
kind
of
articulation
that
makes
sense...
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
then
once
or
twice
by
some
other
courts.
what
they
say
is
that
in
these
programs
the
standard
of
proof
is
something
less
than
a
preponderance,
although
the
fifth
circuit
itself
admits
they
don't
know
what
to
call
it
or
how
much
less.
and
that's
something
we
clearly
take
issue
with.
the
"true
doubt"
rule,
as
it's
presented
to
you,
is
the
department
of
labor
on
its
best
behavior,
arguing
about
something
that
seems
somewhat
more
reasonable
than
we
believe
it
to
be.
certainly,
in
our
experience
it
has
not
operated
that
way.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
almost
always.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
almost
always,
deference
is
given
to
the
finder
of
fact
by
the
appellate
reviewer.
department
of
labor
has
a
couple
of
cases
that
they
can
bring
out
and
say,
well,
this
time
some
control
was
exercised
over
what
the
administrative
law
judge
did,
but
that
is
extremely
rare.
and
i
would
offer
these
two
cases
as
examples
of
that.
these
two
cases
present
evidence
that,
for
those
of
us
who
are
familiar
with
these
kinds
of
cases,
is
not
that
close.
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs,
and
many
other
cases
are
cited
in
the
amicus
briefs
where
administrative
law
judges
are
resolving
all
doubt,
any
doubts,
any
reasonable
doubt,
imposing
a
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
standard,
and
that's
not
controlled.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
justice
scalia,
that
is...
it
is
as
impossible
to
do
that
as
it
is
for
administrative
law
judges
to
repeatedly,
in
case
after
case
after
case,
find
this
complex
evidence
absolutely
tied,
but
that's
what
we
see
in
these
cases.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
i
would
dispute
that
figure.
i
can't
imagine
how
the
department
could
empirically
come
to
that.
what
we
did
was
we
looked
at
the
benefits
review
board
reporter,
which
reports
selected
administrative
law
judge
decisions,
far
from
all
of
them.
and
what
we
found
was
an
increasingly
utilization
of
the
17
to
20
percent
in
current
cases.
but
we
see
it
all
the
time.
and
in
longshore...
in
longshore
cases
they
see
it
all
the
time
as
well.
one
of
the
things
about
the
longshore
cases
is
that
90
to
95
percent
of
them
are
never
litigated.
they
are
not
contested
by
the
employer.
it's
only
the
hard
cases
that
are
contested
by
the
employer.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
i
think
the
third
circuit
didn't
want
to
engage
in
fact
finding.
i
would
expect
that
in
both
of
these
cases,
if
they
went
back
and
were
reviewed
under
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
that
benefits
would
probably
be
denied.
but
that's
not...
i
haven't
analyzed
the
records
in
these
cases
in
a
way
that
puts
me
in
the
shoes
of
the
judge,
and
i
think
the
third
circuit
was
correct
to
let
the
judge
do
the
job
on
that
account.
there
are
several
observations
that
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
that
i
think
will
help
focus
the
case.
first
among
those
is
that
there
is
no
word
or
phrase
or
provision
in
the
black
lung
act
or
in
the
longshore
act
that
prescribes
or,
for
that
matter,
even
suggests
a
"true
doubt"
rule.
there
is
nothing
even
close.
the
department
of
labor
has
asked
you
to
defer
to
its
interpretation
of
these
statutes.
the
department
of
labor
has
not
cited
a
single
word
of
any
of
these
statutes--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--no,
i
don't
think
it's
invalid.
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
it's
a
preamble
rule.
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
read
to
establish
a
"true
doubt"
principle.
let
me
say
that
there
are
three
provisions
in
the
department
of
labor's
regulations
way
back
in
718.300's
and
400's,
and
then
there's
a
published
commentary
in
the
federal
register
where
the
department
of
labor
says
the
burden
of
proving
these
things
is
on
the
claimant,
and
where
this
presumption
doesn't
apply,
the
burden
of
proving
is
going
to
be
on
the
claimant,
two
separate
provisions.
and
then
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
publish
commentary
in
the
federal
register...
when
the
statute
was
amended
and
all
of
these
burden-shifting
presumptions
in
black
lung
were
repealed
in
1981,
they
published
new
provisions
in
the
federal
register
and
there
they
said
that
we
want
facts
now
to
be
decided
for
the
claimants
in
accordance
with
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
now,
they've
said
that
that
doesn't
mean
anything,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
have
a
complex
of
regulations
over
here
that
seem
to
very
specifically
address
these
kinds
of
questions
in
a
way
that
is
fully
consistent
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
ordinary
normal
way
that
adjudications
occur,
the
department
goes
over
here
to
a
preamble
provision
which
doesn't
say
what
they
say
it
says,
by
its
plain
language.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
criminal
standard.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
and
then
i
think
we
would
ask
you
to
do
a
rational
basis
analysis.
i
don't
see
that
that
is
appropriate.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
first,
i
think
you
have
to
deal
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
there,
and
in
the
cases
that
deal
with
efforts
by
agencies
to
alter
the
administrative
procedure
act,
some
very
recent
ones
on
the
d.c.
circuit
and
some
older
ones
by
this
court,
the
holdings
have
uniformly
been
that
the
agency
may
not
write
a
regulation
that
is
inconsistent
with
one
of
the
minimum
basic
standards
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
if
that
doesn't--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--as
it
is
construed,
yes,
it
does.
but
it's
not
necessary
to
construe
it
that
way
because
i
think
the
regulation
still
serves
a
useful
purpose.
there
have
been
cases
where
there
is...
there
are
in
those
regulations...
we've
cited
one,
and
it's
a
good
case
for
this;
it's
called
amax
coal
v.
anderson,
i
believe.
and
there
there
was
a...
the
department
of
labor
has
prescribed
standards
for
total
disability,
some
very
complex
medical
standards,
and
there
was
just
kind
of
a
gap.
and
the
court
said,
well,
we're
going
to
resolve
this
gap
in
favor
of
the
claimant
because
that's
an
appropriate
method
of
construction
for
these
statutes.
and
i
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
i
suppose
that--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--well,
the
hearing
officer
has
got
a
job
to
do,
and
his
job
is
to
conduct
these
proceedings
in
accordance
with
the
normal
rules
and
the
apa
rules.
i
mean,
i
can't
really
argue
with
you
about
whether
this
was
a
species,
and
maybe
it
is
a
species,
but
it
still
does
not
say...
if...
the
department
has
told
the
told
the
court
that
this
has
been
going
on
for
60
some
years.
this
is
a
big,
important
rule
in
this
litigation,
both
under
the
longshore
act
and
under
the
black
lung
act.
and
there's
nothing
that
articulates
the
rule
anyplace
in
these
regulations.
now,
if
this
reflects
60
years
of
jurisprudence,
then
i
don't
see
it.
now,
maybe
it
could
be
read
into
it,
but
i
think
it's
a
very
hard
read,
and
it
becomes
a
more
difficult
read
if
you
look
at
the
rest
of
the
regulations.
and,
of
course,
in
longshore,
then,
they
have
to
give
up
on
the
case
entirely
because
there's
nothing.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
there's
more
to
it
than
that.
there's
some
discussion...
there's
commentary
in
the
regulations.
there
are
two
separate
regulations
which
address
burden
of
proof
by
using
language...
actually,
burden
of
proving,
which
may
be
a
little
different;
it
implies
something
more
than
just
burden
of
proof...
that
are
apparently
directly
on
point.
and--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--well,
and
i'm
sure
the
department--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--well,
i'm
sure
the
department
would
say
that
a
tie
is
a
reasonable
basis.
i
can't...
the
debate--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--i
think
ultimately
goes
no
place.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
and
that
could
be.
but,
i
mean,
look
at
even
with
the
title.
it's:
"the
scope
and
intent
of
this
part.
"
that
doesn't
seem
to
announce
a
rule.
and
then
you
have
another
rule
which
talks
about...
which
is
entitled...
has
a
title
having
something
to
do
with
burdens,
and
you'd
certainly
expect
to
go
look
to
the
rule
that
talked
about
burdens
to
find
out
what
the
burdens
were,
and
not
to
kind
of
general
discussion
of
what
the
statute
was
all
about.
it's
very
difficult,
i
think,
and
it
is
not
the
natural
or
normal
reading
of
718.3
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
department
comes
to.
i
think
they
come
to
it
because
there's
no
authority,
and
that's...
that
has
always
been
the
problem
with
this,
with
the
rule.
the
rule
is
optionally
applied
by
administrative
law
judges,
and
from
our
point
of
view
it
is--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--i'm
going
back.
yeah,
i'm
going
back
to
the
"true
doubt"
rule.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
in
a
benefits
review
board
decision
in
1978,
not
so
much
naming
a
rule
but,
i
guess,
distinguishing
it
from
some
other
kind
of
doubt.
it
was
a
case
called
provance,
which
is
cited
to
you,
where
the
department...
where
the
claimant
had
gone
in
and
said
you
have
to
resolve
all
debts
for
me
because
i'm
a
claimant.
and
the
board
said,
no,
we
only
resolve
the
true
doubts
for
you,
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
i
do
disagree
with
it.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
correct.
some
other
points
that
i
think
are
important.
and
this
is
not
a
rule
that's
used,
or
anything
like
it,
in
state
workers'
compensation
laws.
we
have
surveyed
them.
it's
not
a
rule
that's
used
in
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
that
covers
this
court
and
the
department
of
labor
and
the
folks
from
the
solicitor
general's
office.
it's
not
a
rule
that's
used
in
the
common
law.
it's
not
a
rule
that's
used
by
the
society
security
administration.
and
all
of
these
are
remedial...
these
are
remedial
programs
or
statutes
or
just
provisions
of
the
law
that
recognize
the
rights
of
people
to
recover
monetary
damages
for
their
losses.
and--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--none
at
all.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
we'd
lose.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
and
that's
why
this
rule
engenders
such
amazing
hostility.
and
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
articulate
the
degree
of
hostility
this
rule
engenders
on
the
defense
side
of
these
cases.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
if
the
administrative
law
judge
is
held
to
the
rigor
of
a
normal
standard
of
proof,
then
the
administrative
law
judge
is
going
to
be
required
to
carefully
review
the
record.
sure,
in
a
close
case...
i
don't
think
there
has
ever
been
a
close
enough...
a
real
close
case,
a
tie,
where
an
administrative
law
judge,
or
any
judge,
couldn't
find
a
reason
to
rule
in
whatever
direction
the
judge
thought
was
appropriate.
that's
why
this
rule
is
so
problematic
for
us,
because
the
cases
where
the
rule
is
ordinarily
applied
are
cases
where
it
isn't
that
close,
and
then
we
have
to
take
it
up
on
appeal.
and
this
rule
also,
by
the
way,
increases
the
volume
of
litigation
in
these
cases
very
substantially,
because
the
defense
is
so
mad
at
having
been
treated
this
way
and
having
had
the
evidence,
that
it
often
has
painstakingly
developed,
thrown
out
the
window
or
discounted
just
because
they
don't
like
them,
they
don't
like
the
party.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
i
think
the
rule
doesn't...
the
rule
discounts
the
evidence
because
of
the
identity
of
the
party.
the
rule
says
that
the
persuasion
of
this
evidence...
not
the
bulk
weight,
we're
not
talking
about
that...
but
the
persuasion
of
this
evidence
is
going
to
be
reduced
because
we
want
to
favor
a
particular
party.
that
makes
a
litigant
mad.
it's
not
a
fair
adjudication,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
when
that
kind
of
rule
applies.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
no,
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
think
when
congress
does
it,
it
does
make
it
go
down
an
awful
lot
easier,
and
that's
particularly
true
in
these
programs.
i
mean,
workers'
compensation
laws
are
vehicles
for
the
largest
privately
funded
social
insurance
programs
in
the
united
states,
and
they're
very
carefully
balanced
and
controlled.
even
if
their
primary
objective
is
the
compensation
of
deserving
workers,
they
have
lots
of
other
objectives.
and
in
workers'
compensation
legislation...
this
is
true
on
the
federal
side
and
it's
certainly
true
on
the
state
side
as
well...
the
employers
and
insurance
carriers
and
unions
and
claimant
advocates
work
together
with
legislatures
to
make
sure
that
these
programs
are
at
an
appropriate
level
of
acceptability
and
that
they
provide
appropriate
benefits
to
people.
they're
complex
programs,
and
if
that
kind
of
provision
was
in
a
workers'
compensation
law,
then
i
can
assure
you
that
it
was
a
provision
that
was
bargained
for,
that
was
properly
debated
in
the
legislative
process,
and
that
was
understood
even
if
somebody
lost
the
debate.
it
becomes
a
more
acceptable
proposition.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where...
and
clear
and
convincing
in
reverse,
i
guess,
is
perhaps
what
the
department
of
labor
is
talking
about.
but
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
department,
without
any
authority,
without
having
tested
this
principle
in
the
ordinary
way,
through
the
analyses
that
it's
put
to
in
congress...
the
department
of
labor
has
just
decided
that
they
would
like
to
have
this
principle
used,
and
that
they
would
like
to
have
the
volume
of
approved
claims
increased.
or
for
whatever
reason;
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference.
it's
not...
i
think
that
from
what
i
gather
from
the
people
that
i
talk
to
about
this,
we
can't
get
the
kind
of
fair
hearing
that
we
want
to
have
if
this
principle,
for
this
kind
of
principle...
because
it's
a
very
important
one
and
it's
a
very
powerful
one,
just
by
litigating
it
against
the
government
and
looking
at
statutes.
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
does
control,
first
of
all.
and
that's
not
an
unimportant
point.
it
ought
to
control.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
i
think
that
the
footnote
is
incomplete,
and
therefore
i
disagree
with
it.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
it
works.
i
think
that
if
somebody
puts
facts
into
play
by
alleging
an
affirmative
defense
that's
supported
by
facts,
then
the
administrative
law
judge,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things,
is
going
to
have
to
find
those
facts
or
not
find
them.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
it
troubles
me,
because
i
think
that
we
don't...
i
know
where
my
interpretation
goes
with
these
statutes.
i
guess
it
troubles
me
to
think
that
we're
simply
throwing
that
outcome,
so
i
can't
answer
that
for
you
and
so
i'm
not
comfortable
just
saying
it.
it
might
be...
it
may
be
right.
it
certainly
has
some
logic
to
it.
thank
you.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
