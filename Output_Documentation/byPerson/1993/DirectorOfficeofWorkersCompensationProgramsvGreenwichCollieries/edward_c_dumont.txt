mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
adjudications
under
the
black
lung
benefits
act
and
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
the
department
of
labor
and
the
courts
have
long
applied
an
evidentiary
tie
breaker
known
as
the
"true
doubt"
rule.
there
are
three
points
fundamental
to
understanding
the
proper
outcome
of
this
case:
what
the
"true
doubt"
rule
is,
where
it
comes
from,
and
why
its
application
does
not
contravene
the
administrative
procedure
act.
first,
it's
important
to
understand
what
the
"true
doubt"
rule
does
and
does
not
say.
it's
applied
in
the
adjudication
of
contested
benefit
claims.
it
resolves
factual
issues
in
favor
of
a
claimant
if,
but
only
if,
two
prior
conditions
are
met.
first,
each
party,
both
the
claimant
and
the
employer,
must
have
adduced
substantial,
competent
evidence
to
support
the
position
that
that
party
is
taking
in
the
adjudication.
and
second,
the
trier
of
fact
must
have
evaluated
the
evidence
and
concluded
that
the
evidence
produced
on
each
side
is
equally
probative.
in
those
rare
circumstances
of
evidentiary
equipoise,
the
"true
doubt"
rule
intervenes
to
direct
that
judgment
be
rendered
for
the
claimant.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
that
we
can
see
that
it
doesn't
happen
all
the
time
from
the
fact
that,
as
the
statistics
quoted
in
our
brief
point
out,
under
current
law,
black
lung
claimants
are
successful
in
achieving
benefits
only
in
about
7
percent
of
the
cases.
now,
if
the
50
and
100
percent.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
those
are
the
cases...
well,
we
don't
know.
presumably,
less
than
all
of
them,
so
that
in
even
a
smaller
percentage
is
the
"true
doubt"
rule
determinative
of
the
outcome.
now,
it
may
be
that
in
many
cases
the
rule
is
recited,
or
it
may
be
in
some
cases
that
the
rule
determines
one
issue
but
it
does
not
determine
the
outcome,
because
there
are
various
cases
where
a
claimant
prevails
on
one
issue
because
of
the
"true
doubt"
rule
but
another
issue
goes
in
favor
of
the
employer.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
we
think
that
in
some
of
these
cases
there
are
reasons
why
the
alj...
particular
reasons
why
the
alj's
may
find
equipoise
more
commonly
than
normal,
particularly
because
you
often
have
cases
such
as
the
early
cases
under
the
longshore
act
or
the
maher
case
here,
where
there's
a
complicated
question
of
medical
causation,
you
have
respectable
medical
opinions
on
both
sides
of
the
issue.
in
some
cases
the
alj--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--there
are
no
comparable
compiled
or
published
statistics.
the
department
of
labor
informs
us
that
the
7
or
8
percent
of
longshore
cases,
so
the
figure
would
be
comparable
to
that
extent.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
we
would
simply
point
out
that
it's
not
being
applied
across
the
board
and
indiscriminately
by
alj's
to
avoid
their
responsibility
to
evaluate
the
evidence
and
to
reach
conclusions
as
to
which
party
has
produced
preponderance,
where
one
party
or
the
other
has
produced
a
preponderance.
we
think
that
the
evidence
is
generally
to
the
effect
that
the
alj's
take
their
responsibility
very
seriously,
and
that
the
benefits
review
board
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
in
turn,
take
their
responsibility
seriously
to
review
those
judgments
and
to
make
sure
that
in
cases
where
this
rule
is
applied,
one
can
fairly
say
that
the
fact
finder
was
not
able
to
determine
that
one
side
had
produced
a
preponderance.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
both
the
benefits
review
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
apply
a
substantial
evidence
standard
of
review,
in
general,
to
alj
decisions.
and
in
this
case
they
would
apply
the
same
standard
of
review
that
a
court
would
normally
apply
on
any
ultimate
finding
of
fact,
which
is
to
say
they
will
be
deferential
to
the
resolution
of
factual
issues
by
the
fact
finder.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
not
always.
it
does
mean
that
in
many
cases...
in
a
case
where
it's
appropriate
to
apply
the
rule,
it
is
probable
that
any
one
of
three
decisions
would
be
upheld;
decision
in
favor
of
either
party
or
decision
that
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise
and
therefore
that
the
doubt
goes
to
the
claimant.
but
it's
important
to
point
out
that
both
the
benefits
review
board
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
reversed
decisions
below
applying
the
"true
doubt"
rule,
on
the
ground
that
as
in
any
other
ultimate
finding
of
fact,
the
trier
of
fact
was
simply
out
of
line
in
concluding
that
the
evidence
was
in
equipoise
or
favored
one
party
or
the
other.
now,
the
last
thing
i'd
like
to
point
out
about
the
"true
doubt"
rule
and
how
it
applies
is
that
it
never...
it's
important
to
understand
this.
it
never
permits
a
claimant
to
be
awarded
benefits
without
having
produced
evidence,
substantial
evidence
to
support
his
entitlement
under
the
statute
in
the
regulations.
and
it
never
denies
the
employer
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
meet
that
evidence
and
to
establish
that
benefits
should
not
be
awarded
under
the
statutory
criteria.
the
"true
doubt"
rule
grows
out
of
a
long
tradition
of
adjudication
by
the
courts
primarily
under
the
longshore
act.
you
will
recall
that
that
act
was
passed
in
1927,
with
the
district
courts
primarily
the
forum
for
litigation.
as
long
ago
as
1944,
the
second
circuit,
in
the
f.
h.
mcgraw
v.
lowe
case,
upheld
an
administrative
decision
on
facts
remarkably
similar
to
those
in
the
maher
terminals
case.
in
other
words,
in
that
case
a
worker
had
sustained
a
head
injury
at
work,
developed
parkinson's
disease,
and
the
question
was
whether
causation
could
be
shown
or
inferred.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
there
was
no
regulation.
but
what
there
was
was
an
administrative
finding
by
the
agency,
by
the
deputy
commissioner,
that
the
evidence
was
essentially
in
equipoise,
that
he
couldn't
tell
from
the
respectable
medical
opinions
in
front
of
him
which
was
the
better
scientific
answer,
and
that
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
administrative
policy,
the
doubt
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
claimant
because
of
the
remedial
purposes
of
the
act
and
because
the
risk
of
error
should
be
placed
on
the
party
best
able
to
bear
it.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that
was
under
the
longshore
act.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
suit
was
by
an
employer
against
the
deputy
commissioner
who
had
rendered
the
decision
granting
benefits.
the
controversy
was
between
an
employee
and
the
employer.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
am
not
aware
of
any
state
that
does.
i
have
not
surveyed
those
cases.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
know
there's
a
wide
variety
of
state
rules
on
these
issues,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
any
state
imposes
a
rule
comparable
to
the
"true
doubt"
rule.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
decision
announced
in...
or
the
principle
announced
in
f.
h.
mcgraw
v.
lowe,
this
tie-breaking
principle
resolving
doubts
in
favor
of
a
claimant
in
doubtful
cases,
continued
to
be
announced
consistently
by
the
courts
of
appeals
in
reviewing
longshore
act
cases,
and
it
continues
to
be
applied
in
such
cases
today.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
in
f.
h.
mcgraw
v.
lowe
there
was
an
administrative
enunciation
that
was
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
ratified
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it's
not
entirely
clear
where
the...
who
made
the
first
"true
doubt"
decision.
presumably
it
happened...
in
f.
h.
mcgraw
the
court
announced
that
there...
it
was
principle
frequently
articulated
by
the
courts,
is
the
way
they
put
it,
that
doubt
shall
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
now,
that
was
partly
a
statutory
principle
in
the
early
cases
interpreting
the
statute,
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
favorably
to
the
award
of
benefits,
but
it
was
naturally
adapted
to
the
context
of
resolving
factual
disputes
when
those
made
a
difference
to
the
outcome.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
there's
the
burris
case
back
in
1932,
and
that
was
certainly
one
of
the
early
cases
that
announced
the
principle
that,
in
terms
of
statutory
interpretation,
benefits
should...
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
should
go
to
the
claimant,
that's
correct.
in
the
early
1970's
the
congress
changed
the
adjudication
structure
and
brought
in
the
benefits
review
board
as
a
part
of
the
department
of
labor,
to
do
the
initial
level
of
review
of
these
cases.
the
benefits
review
board
continued
the
courts'
general
policy
and
they
refined
it
into
the
narrow
and
clearly
articulated
rule
that
was
applied
in
these
cases
and
is
before
the
court
today,
that
in
cases
of
evidentiary
equipoise,
the
claimant
should
receive
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
factual
issues.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
that
is
one
way
of
reading
it.
but,
in
fact,
the
secretary
interprets
the
burden
of
proving
language
in
the
403
regulation
as
imposing
only
a
burden
of
going
forward,
not
a
burden
of
persuasion.
in
much
the
same
way,
this
court
has
interpreted
the
same
or
closely
similar
language
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
in
section
7(c),
to
refer
only
to
a
burden
of
production
and
not
a
burden
of
persuasion.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
will
admit
that
it
seems
a
little
odd
until,
frankly,
you
start
reading
some
of
the
cases
in
this
area
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
you
realize
that
the
terms
"burden
of
proving"
and
"burden
of
proof"
are
used
quite
loosely,
and
they
quite
often
are
used
in
contexts
where
it's
not
clear
or
not
necessary
to
distinguish
whether
one
is
talking
about
the
burden
of
persuasion
or
the
burden
of
production.
the
apa
is
probably
the
best
example.
the
apa
uses
the
term
7(c),
but
this
court
has
clearly
held,
and
held
correctly,
that
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
7(c),
that
term
refers
only
to
a
burden
of
going
forward.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
respectfully,
i
would
say
it's
not
dictum,
because
if
it
were...
if
the
court
had
not
held
that,
it
would
have
had
to
go
on
to
consider
the
issue
raised
by
the
employer
in
that
case,
that
regardless
of
the
administrative
policies
under
the
labor
board's
interpretation,
the
administrative
procedure
act,
of
its
own
force,
required
that
the
general
counsel
bear
the
burden
on
all
issues
in
adjudication.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
can
say
that
i
think
we
would
feel
very
reluctant
to
ignore
a
flat
statement,
even
in
a
footnote,
in
one
of
this
court's
opinion.
and--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
because
it
was
not
essential...
the
reason
it's
important
is
because
the
court
decided
that
it
was
not
essential
to
reach
that
issue
in
transportation
management.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no.
because
the
reason
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
that
issue
in
transportation
management
was
because
the
term
7(c)
was
construed
to
mean
burden
of
production,
and
not
persuasion.
if
the
court
had
construed
it
to
mean
burden
of
persuasion,
or
thought
that
there
was
a
serious
issue
there,
it
would
have
really
had
to
evaluate...
give
it
a
full-dress
evaluation,
because
otherwise
the
employer
would
have
had
quite
a
substantial
claim.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
we
certainly
don't
rely
on
simply
the
fact
that
the
court
has
said
that
before.
as
i
said,
that
was...
we
think
of
it
as
a
holding,
but
whether
it
was
a
holding
or
not,
it
was
correct
as
a
statement
of
the
law.
the
court,
in
that
footnote,
cited
the
environmental
defense
fund
case
from
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
respectfully,
i
believe
that
the
employer's
brief
in
transportation
management
did
raise
that
argument,
which
is
why
the
court
was
responding
to
it
in
the
footnote.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
exactly.
section
7(c)
has
two
sentences
that
are
considered
to
be
relevant
here.
it's
reprinted
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
on
page
la.
the
first
sentence
of
section
7(c)
says:
"except
as
otherwise
provided
by
statute,
the
proponent
of
a
rule
or
order
has
the
burden
of
proof.
"
now,
there's
two
things
to
note
about
that.
first
is
the
word
"the
proponent".
now,
respondents
labor
mightily
to
convince
us
that
there's
a
natural
reading
to
"the
proponent",
but
we
simply
point
out
that
in
any
case
that's
before
the
agency,
the
agency
is
going
to
have
to
render
one
decision
or
the
other,
and
there
is
always
a
proponent
of
both
results.
there's
a
proponent
of
benefits
in
these
cases
and
there's
a
proponent
of
the
denial
of
benefits.
so
7(c)'s
first
sentence,
by
itself,
doesn't
tell
us
who
it's
talking
about.
in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
the
claimant
has
brought
the
case
to
the
board
and
the
claimant
wants
the
board
to
order
payment,
or
wants
the
alj
to
award
benefits.
but
it's
equally
true
that
once
the
case
is
there,
the
employer
wants
an
order
denying
benefits,
and
is
a
proponent
of
that
order.
and
i
think
that's
quite
clear,
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
possible.
one
can
phrase
it
either
way.
interestingly,
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
of
this
section,
what
congress
said,
what
the
committee
said
was
that:
"the
proponent
of
a
rule
or
order
has
the
burden
of
proof
means
not
only
that
the
party
initiating
the
proceeding
has
the
general
burden
of
coming
forward,
but
that
other
parties
who
are
proponents
of
some
different
result
also,
for
that
purpose,
have
a
burden
to
maintain.
"
and
we
think
that
that
makes
it
quite
clear
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
using
this
language
was
a
burden
of
coming
forward,
and
a
burden
of
coming
forward
that
applies
to
every
party,
including
an
agency
in
a
case
where
there's
only
an
agency
and,
say,
someone
seeking
a
license.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
it's
very
difficult,
after
you
look
at
all
the
cases,
to
say
that
it
has
a
normal
meaning.
it
has
a
meaning
which
encompasses
both
burdens
of
persuasion
and
burdens
of
production.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
will
simply
point
out
that
if
you
interpret...
if
one
interprets
it
to
mean
burden
of
production,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
did...
and
this
is
something
the
d.c.
circuit
pointed
out...
then
it
is
perfectly
consistent
to
say
that
both
parties,
all
parties
in
the
litigation
have
the
same
burden,
which
is
what
the
legislative
history
says.
now,
if
we
interpret
it
to
mean
burden
of
persuasion,
that's
incoherent,
because
only
one
party
in
any
proceeding
can
have
the
burden
of
persuasion
if
there's
a
preponderance
established.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
certainly
speaks
to
both
the
quantity
and
quality
of
evidence,
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
what
congress
was
particularly
getting
at
when
they
passed
the
apa,
in
the
substantial
evidence
portions,
was
to
try
to
make
sure
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
any
decision
that
was
rendered
by
an
agency,
to
get
away
from
a
sort
of
scintilla
standard
that
some
courts
had
applied
before
in
upholding
agency
decisions.
now,
they
did
that
by
saying,
look,
there
must
be
competent,
probative,
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
whatever
result
in
reached.
this
court,
in
steadman,
did
say
that
no
external
consideration
of
equity
could
supervene
to
require
an
agency
to
carry
a
higher
burden
of
proof
than
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
under
section
7(c).
that's
what
steadman
really
stands
for.
but
even
taking
it
to
say
that
section
7(c)
in
the
third
sentence
imposes
a
preponderance
standard
as
the
norm
in
all
apa-governed
litigation,
the
important
thing
to
realize
about
a
standard
of
evidence
like
preponderance
is
that
it
tells
us
absolutely
nothing
about
what
to
do
when
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise.
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
burden...
the
party
upon
whom
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
placed
fails,
that's
exactly
right,
but
that's
why
you
need
a
burden
of
persuasion
rule
which
is
different
from
the
standard
of
proof.
now,
the
standard
of
proof
may
be
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
first
and
third
sentences
of
section
7(c),
you
can
see
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
talking
about
burdens
of
going
forward
and
burdens
of
persuasion,
which
is
really
covered
by
the
first
sentence,
and
talking
about
the
standard
of
evidence
that
whoever
bears
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
a
particular
point
has
to
meet.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
so
far
as
i
know,
it
was
part
of
the
original
718
regulations,
which
were
adopted
in
1980,
i
believe.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
as
a
response,
in
general,
to
the
transfer
of
functions
from
the
secretary
of
hhs
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
a
specific
predecessor
to
that
regulation,
no.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes.
there
was
a
preamble...
a
standard
sort
of
preamble
that
went
along
with
them.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no,
not
at
all.
there
is--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--if
you
look
on
the
previous
page
of
our
brief,
on
page
1a,
the
regulation
718.3(c).
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that
says
that...
it
says
two
things.
first
of
all,
that
in
enacting
the
black
lung
act,
congress
intended
that
claimants
be
given
the
benefit
of
all
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
existence
of
total
or
partial
disability
or
death
due
to
pneumoconiosis.
and
that,
of
course,
is
taken
straight
out
of
several
iterations
of
legislative
history
on
the
acts.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
we
believe
it
does.
we
believe
that
when
it
goes
on
to
say,
"this
part
shall
be
construed
and
applied
in
that
spirit
and
is
designed
to
reflect
that
intent.
"
it
certainly
embodies
the
intent
of
the
"true
doubt"
rule,
which
is
on
any
particular
factual
issue.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
does
not
state
the
"true
doubt"
rule
in
terms.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
right.
we
would
say...
we
have
two
points
about
this.
first
of
all,
that
there
has
been
not...
there
has
not
been
a
need
under
either
act
to
promulgate
a
specific
regulation
on
this
issue
because,
up
until
very
recently
it
has
not
been
challenged.
there's
been
a
long
course
of
consistent
adjudication
and
there's
been
no
reason
to
articulate
a
more
specific
policy.
a
specific
policy,
including
the
"true
doubt"
rule
in
the
terms
on
which
we
rely,
has
been
articulated
in
the
seventies
and
through
the
eighties
in
the
decisions
of
the
benefits
review
board
which,
of
course,
is
part
of
the
department
of
labor.
now,
had
the
secretary
been
dissatisfied
with
the
way
the
brb
was
applying
these
rules,
presumably
he
might
have
issued
a
regulation
on
this
issue,
but
there's
been
no
need
to
do
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
can
be.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--it
would
not
be
open
to
regulatory
change
if
the
statute
itself
provided
a
rule
for
the
burden
of
persuasion.
but
the
statutes
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
them,
are
quite
interesting
the
way
they're
phrased.
they're
not
phrased
in
terms
of
a
claimant
is
entitled
to
benefits
if
he
or
she
persuades
the
adjudicator
that
x,
y,
and
z.
they're
phrased
in
terms...
in
much
more
passive
terms;
benefits
will
be
provided
in
respect
of
certain
conditions
and
that
sort
of
thing.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
resolves
the
issue
of
where
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
lies
on
a
contested
factual
point,
in
that
context.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
if
you
agree...
if
you
believe
that
the
apa
imposes
a
preponderance
standard
on
all
litigation
where
it
applies,
then
we
would
still
say
we
win
this
case,
because
we
think
that
the
apa...
section
7(c)
in
particular,
and
the
apa
in
general,
provide
for
exceptions.
section
7(c)
starts
out
"except
as
otherwise
provided
by
statute.
"
and
we
think,
as
we've
articulated
in
our
brief,
that
there
are
provisions
of
both
statutes
that
can
be
read
to
accept
this
particular
application
of
an
evidentiary
rule
from
the
sweep
of
the
apa.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
we
think
it
puts
within
the
agency's
sphere
of
decision
making
the
same
kind
of
issue
it
has...
the
same
kind
of
decision
it
has
on
many
issues,
which
is
what
is
consistent
with
congressional
policy
and
the
intent
of
the
statute.
and
any
such
decision
would
be
subject
to
review,
and
in
many
contexts
one
would
find
that
it
would
not
be
plausible
to
believe
that
congress
had
intended
for
there
to
be
a
burden
of
persuasion
placed
on
one
party
or
the
other.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
not
aware
of
exactly
what
a
count
would
be,
no.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
you're
speaking
in
terms
of
the
black
lung
act
and
its
incorporation.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
when
the
apa
is
incorporated
in
the
black
lung
act,
for
instance,
it's
incorporated
under
a
regime
which
first
of
all
says
that
the
apa
doesn't
apply
except
as
specifically
provided.
then
it's
incorporated
from
the
longshore
act,
but
with
a
specific
statutory
proviso
that
it's
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
regulation.
and
we
think
that
by
the
time
you
work
through
the
various
levels
of
statutory
and
regulatory
analysis,
it's
fairly
clear
that
the
secretary
has
the
ability--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
that
involves
quite
this
kind
of
statutory
structure.
with
your
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
brief
points.
first
of
all,
this
position
that...
the
"true
doubt"
rule
was
not
developed
for
this
litigation.
on
the
longshore
side,
let
me
refer
you
just
back
once
again
to
the
f.
h.
mcgraw
case,
which
i
think
you
will
find
factually
strikingly
similar
to
the
maher
case,
and
other
sources.
the
department's
instructions--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--no,
it
does
not
use
the
same
words,
but
i
really
think
that's
irrelevant.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
it
puts
a
label
on
it.
and,
frankly,
i
think
all
you
could
say
about
this
is
the
department
of
labor
and
the
benefits
review
board
have
narrowed
and
made
this
concept
much
more
specific
to
the
rule
that's
in
front
of
the
court
today.
and
they're
hardly
to
be
faulted
for
having
taken
something
that
was
more
general
and
more
vague
and
made
it
more
specific
and
confined
its
application.
the
rule,
in
these
terms,
is
in
the
secretary's
instructions
to
adjudicators
which
were
promulgated
in
1980,
which
are
cited
in
note
20...
note
14
on
page
27
of
our
brief.
it's
in
commentary
to
regulations
that
were
issued
in
the
early
1980's.
it's
in
a
long
series
of
board
decisions
from
the
seventies
and
eighties.
it's
simply
not
true...
it's
been
accepted
by
five
or
six
circuits.
it's
simply
not
true
to
say
that
this
is
something
we
made
up
for
this
case.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
it's
equally
fair
to
infer
that
congress,
when
it
passed
the
apa,
did
not
intend
to
disturb
well
settled
principles
of
adjudication
under
preexisting
statutes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that
was
changed,
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
makes
quite
clear
that
change
did
not
import
any
substantive
change.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
did
not
eliminate
it.
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
bit
difficult,
again,
to
have
a
situation
where
you
have
burdens
of
persuasion
on
two
different
parties,
where
that's
clearly
what
congress
contemplated,
was
that
whatever
burden
they
were
talking
about
was
going
to
be
on
more
than
one
party
in
the
case.
finally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there's
really
nothing...
there's
nothing
necessary
about
calling
something
an
affirmative
defense.
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
saying
that
something's
an
affirmative
defense
states
a
conclusion,
not
some
sort
of
natural
fact.
in
transportation
management
the
point
was
whether
or
not
somebody
was
liable
for
a
violation
of
the
federal
labor
laws.
the
labor
board
had
decided,
as
a
matter
of
its
discretion
in
administering
the
statute,
to
put
a
burden
of
proof
on
one
issue
involved
in
deciding
that
on
the
employer,
and
the
court
upheld
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
deferring
to
the
board's
judgment
and
finding
that
it
was
reasonable
for
the
board
to
take
that
judgment.
that's
why
it's
called
an
affirmative
defense,
because
it
was
reasonable
to
place
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
employer.
and
all
it
really
points
out
is
that
you
have
to
look,
in
every
statutory
context,
at
the
particular
context
involved.
and
in
workers'
compensation
we
have
a
context
where
of
course
you
want
to
require,
as
we
do
require,
the
employee
to
come
forward
with
evidence.
thank
you.
