justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
are
two
cases.
the
director
of
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs,
department
of
labor
against
greenwich
collieries,
and
director
of
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs
against
maher
terminals,
and
the
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
in
adjudicating
benefits
claims
under
the
black
lung
benefits
act
and
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
the
department
of
labor
applies
what
it
calls
the
true
doubt
rule.
this
rule
essentially
shifts
the
burden
of
persuasion
to
the
party
opposing
the
benefits
claim.
in
other
words,
when
the
evidence
in
the
case
is
evenly
balanced,
the
benefits
claimant
wins.
the
administrative
law
judges
in
both
the
cases
before
us
applied
the
true
doubt
rule
holding
that
the
claimant
could
prevail
because
the
evidence
on
both
sides
was
an
equipoise.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
in
both
cases.
in
striking
down
the
true
doubt
rule,
the
court
of
appeals
created
a
conflict
with
other
courts
of
appeals
which
had
upheld
the
rule.
we
took
this
case
to
resolve
this
conflict.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
that
the
true
doubt
rule
violates
section
7(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
states
that
the
proponent
of
a
rule
or
order
has
the
burden
of
proof.
we
conclude
that
the
ordinary
meaning
of
burden
of
proof
is
burden
of
persuasion,
and
hold
that
section
7(c)
imposes
a
burden
of
persuasion,
not
simply
a
burden
of
production.
these
benefits
statutes
and
the
department
of
labor's
regulations
interpreting
them
provide
for
a
variety
of
presumptions
favoring
benefits
claimants.
at
the
same
time,
the
administrative
procedure
act
limits
the
department's
discretion
in
various
respects.
one
such
important
limitation
is
section
7(c),
the
burden
of
proof
section,
which
we
conclude
requires
the
benefits
claimant
to
bear
the
burden
of
persuasion.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justices
blackmun
and
stevens.
