unknown
speaker
ms.
ibanez,
may
i
inquire
of
you?
you...
do
you
acknowledge
that
you
engage
in
public
accounting
on
occasion?
unknown
speaker
if
you
did
practice
public
accounting,
do
you
recognize
that
you
have
to
abide
by
the
regulations
of
the
board
of
public
accounting?
unknown
speaker
and
did
you
take
a
different
position
earlier
in
the
litigation?
unknown
speaker
reading
the
briefs,
i
got
the
impression
that
the
position
you've
taken
has
shifted
somewhat
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
and
does
the
board
take
the
position
that
your
law
firm
somehow
has
to
be
licensed
or
authorized
as...
by
the
board
of
accounting
for
accountancy?
unknown
speaker
and
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
the
cfp
designation
after
your
name
in
the
advertisement,
how
is
somebody
reading
that
ad
supposed
to
verify
what
that
means
and
whether
you're
a
member
in
good
standing
of
whatever
that
organization
is?
unknown
speaker
but
does...
your
advertisement
at
least
doesn't
make
any
explanation
about
what
that
is
or
who
has
issued
the
certificate,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
the
question
i
asked
was
whether
your
advertisement,
the
one
at
issue
here,
had
any
explanation
about
the
cfp
designation?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
well,
could...
could
the
state
require
some
explanation
of
the
certified
financial
planner
designation?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understood
your
answer.
i
think
it
was
a
concise
answer.
but
you're
saying
that
the
state
could
require
this
of
an...
of
an
accountant,
but
not
of
an
attorney?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
your
position
then,
is
that
a
state
may
require
some
sort
of
disclaimer
or
explanation
of
the
use
of
the
term
c...
certified
financial
planner,
cfp,
either
when
that
is
used
by
someone
in
conjunction
with
advertising
their
services
as
an
attorney,
or
in
advertising
their
services
as
an
accountant?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
i
don't
understand
why
there's
concern
about
lack
of
information
as
to
what
the
letters
mean.
after
all,
physicians
use
m.d.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
don't
know
what
that
means.
and
i...
i
don't
recall
anybody
ever
requiring
an
explanation
of
m.d.--
and
now
we're
developing
the
practice
among
lawyers
of
using
e-s-q,
esquire.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
you
said
there
are
two
levels
of
regulation
by
the
accountancy
board,
and
you
comply
with
one
about
your
general
qualifications.
and
i
gather
you
do
not
comply
with
the
different
level?
unknown
speaker
what...
just
help
me
out
a
little
bit...
what
is
the
nature
of
the
reg...
the
second
layer
of
regulation?
what
are
we
talking
about
anyway?
what
do
they
require
that
arguably
you
may
or
may
not
do?
i'm
not
asking
you
to
plead
guilty,
but
what
is
it
that
we're
talking
about
here?
unknown
speaker
but
i
still
don't
understand
what
this
second
layer
of
regulation
regulates.
what
does
it
make
you
do
or
forbid
you
from
doing?
i
mean,
what...
how
could
you
possibly
violate
that?
i
don't
even
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
that
would
be
contingency
fees
for
performing
accounting
services?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
and
you're
saying
if
you
took
a
contingency
fee
for
handling
a
lawsuit,
that
should
not
violate
that
provision?
unknown
speaker
were
you
ever
told...
was
petitioner
ever
told
expressly
what
she
must
do
to
bring
herself
into
compliance
with
the
regulation
that
she
was
censured
for
violating?
unknown
speaker
is--
unknown
speaker
--in...
in
your
view,
does
the
state
have
a
valid
interest
in...
in
prohibiting
the...
the...
the
formation
of
an
accounting
firm
which
includes
non-accountants...
or
non-cpa's,
i
should
say?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
there's
a
provision,
but
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
it
is
a
valid
provision?
unknown
speaker
including
the
regulation
that
requires
separate
firm
registration?
unknown
speaker
okay.
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
in
florida
cpa's
can
list...
who
are
practicing
cpa's...
they're
accountants...
can
they
list
the
fact
that
they're
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
could
a
cpa
with...
perhaps
i
should
ask
your
opponent
this
rather
than
you...
but
could
a
cpa,
without
violating
the
regulations,
who
is
a
practicing
cpa,
does
tax
work
and
audits
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff...
could
such
a
cpa
put
on
his
or
her
business
card,
also
a
member
of
the
florida
bar?
unknown
speaker
well,
from
a
constitutional
standpoint,
what's
your
answer
to
that
question?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
there
is
a
constitutional
right
for
an
accountant
to
say
that...
who
is
practicing
as
an
accounting...
to
list
on
their
letterhead
or
in
their
professional
announcement
the
fact
that
they
are
an
attorney?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question.
since
you
indicate...
i
think
this
was
your
position...
that
a
disclaimer
or
an
explanation
of
cfp
might
be
required,
should
this
case
be
remanded?
unknown
speaker
ms.
ibanez,
do
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
to
say
that
you...
you
were
laced
with
a
total
prohibition,
and
there
might
not
be
any
controversy
if
the
board
came
back
with
something
specific...
you
might
agree
with
it
and
there
might
not
be
any
controversy?
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
remains
hypothetical
at
this
point,
because
we
don't
have
any
specifics
of
what
a
clarification
might
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
think
when
you
come
to
the
use
of
cert...
cfp,
which
stands,
i
guess,
for
certified
financial
planner--
unknown
speaker
--i
would
think
that
at
the
very
least
you
would
have
to
acknowledge
there
is
a
potential
there
that
the
public
will
be
misled
into
thinking
that
somehow
the
state
has
certified
you
as
a
certified
financial
planner.
and,
in
fact,
this
is
a
certificate
issued
by
some
private
organization,
as
i
understand
it.
and
so,
i
would
think
there
would
be
that
much
of
a
concern
there
at
the
state
level
that
might
justify
either
an
outright
ban
or
some
kind
of
a
disclaimer.
unknown
speaker
how
could
that...
how
could
that
be?
what
disclaimer
attached
to
the
cpa
would
make
it
clear
that
the
cfp
is
not
a
state
credential?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would...
it
would
prevent
you
from
misleading
any
people
looking
for
accountants.
it
would
not
prevent
you
from
misleading
people
looking
for
lawyers.
but
you're
saying
that's
none
of
the
board's
business,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
the
person
looking
for
the
lawyer
sees
cfp>
["]
next
to
cpa>
["]
and
knows
that
cpa
is
a
state-conferred
certificate
and
assumes
that
cfp
is
a
state-conferred...
and
you
say,
that's
okay
because
people
looking
for
lawyers
deserve
what
they
get...
is
that
it?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
that...
that
people
who
are
being
misled
are
people
in
the
market
for
lawyers,
not
people
in
the
market
for
accountants...
if
there
is
any
misleading?
unknown
speaker
and
the
florida
bar
takes
the
position
that
you're
not
misleading
anybody?
unknown
speaker
the
petitioner
would
not
be
before
this
court
if
she
were
attorney-at-law
and
cfp
and
not
cpa?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
other
factual
question
about
this
winding
road?
i'm
still
somewhat
un...
i
don't
really
thoroughly
understand
the
second
layer
of
regulation
referred
to
earlier.
is
there
a
procedure
in
the
florida
regulation
of
accountants
whereby
they
not
only
regulate
the
individual...
you
have
a
license
as
a
cpa,
as
i
understand
it...
but
if
you
did
want
to
practice
accounting,
would
you
have
to
get
a
separate
license
to
have
your
firm
also
licensed?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is,
supposing
you
got
another
person
who
is
also
an
accountant,
you
are
a
cpa,
your
other
person
is
also
a
cpa,
but
you
want
to
practice
as
a
firm
of
x
and
y,
do
you
have
to
get
a
third
license
for
the
firm
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
you
do.
i
see.
and
that's
what
their
really...
their...
their
complaint
is...
that
you
don't
have
such
a
license.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
you
don't
need
it
because
you're
not
practicing
accounting?
unknown
speaker
let
me...
i
hate
to
be
asking
these
stupid
little
questions,
but
i
wanted...
if...
if
you
just
want
to
be
a
sole
practitioner
as
a
cpa,
do
you
need
two
licenses
or
one?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
without,
yes,
being
incorporated
or
a
partnership.
unknown
speaker
period?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
ibanez.
ms.
nelson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
she
claims
she
is
not
providing
accounting
services.
unknown
speaker
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
shows
that
she
is
providing
accounting
services?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
practice
of
accountancy
under
florida
law?
unknown
speaker
so,
then...
then
a
lawyer
who
represents
people
in
tax
matters
is
practicing
accounting?
unknown
speaker
and
tax
representation
is
included
among
them?
unknown
speaker
she
could
do...
she
doesn't
do
audit
and
attest,
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
undisputed?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
to
us
now
that
she
could
do
everything
that
she's
doing...
the
tax
representation...
if
she
were
merely
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
she
could
do
those
functions?
unknown
speaker
but
if
she
is
also
certified
as
a
cpa--
unknown
speaker
--she
can't?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you...
do
you
have...
what...
what
is...
what
is
your
evidence
that
she
is
not
adhering
to
them?
the
only
thing
i
gather
that's
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
record
is
that
she
did
not
separately
register
her
professional
corporation.
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--then
why
didn't
you...
why
didn't
the
board
simply
go
after
her
to
revoke
her
cpa
license
because
she
had
failed
to
register
her
corporation?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
may
inextricably
intertwined,
but
do
you
not
understand...
is
there
any
reason...
let
me
put
it
this
way...
why
the
board
cannot
go
after
her
for
failing
to...
to
register
her
corporation
and
fight
it
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
fight
it
out
as
to
the
validity
of
the
regulation,
if
she
contests
it...
and
i
don't
know
that
she
does--
unknown
speaker
--without...
without
raising
any
first
amendment
problem?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
my
understanding
is
that
that
wasn't
a
part
of
the
complaint
that
was
retained
before
the
board.
unknown
speaker
are
you
referring
to
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
my
understanding
is
that
the
only
rulings
that
were
before
the
board
after
the
complaint
was
amended
was,
first,
that
this
cfp
designation
was
misleading,
and
the
second,
that
the
cpa
designation
was
misleading.
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
incorrect
statement?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
the
conclusions
of
law...
which
was
the
basis
of
the...
the
board's
action...
were
simply
that
cpa
and...
and
cfp
were
misleading,
why
isn't...
that's...
that's
all
that's
before
us.
unknown
speaker
can
you
read
the
finding
on
which
you're
relying
that
says
just
that?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
finding
as
distinguished
from
a
charge.
unknown
speaker
approximately?
unknown
speaker
now--
--she
is...
she
is
a
cpa?
unknown
speaker
is
there...
in
the...
in
the
view
of
the
board,
is
there
any
way
that
she
can
distinguish
herself
legitimately
from
a
non-cpa?
she's
an
attorney-at-law,
she
advertises
as
an
attorney-at-law.
she
is
also
a
cpa.
is
there
a
way
that
she
can
present
that
credential
to
the
public...
that
she
is
in
fact
a
cpa,
which
is
undisputed?
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
mislead?
it
seems
to
me
you
confuse
the
board's
power
to
compel
licensing
of
the
firm
with
the
board's
power
to
prohibit
speech
because
it
misleads
the
public
in
some
detrimental
way.
how
is
the
public
detrimentally
misled?
let's
assume
that
she's
failed
to
license
her...
her
full...
her
whole
firm.
the
public
sees
cpa>
["].
she
is
a
cpa.
how
has
the
public
been
harmed?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
worst
that
can
happen
then
is
that
some
member
of
the
public
calls
up
and
says,
i
want
you
to
perform
an
audit
function
for
me.
and
she
says,
well,
my
firm
is
not
licensed
as
a
cpa
firm
and
i
can't
go
that
far.
i
mean,
that's
the
extent
of
the
misleading.
if
she
then
goes
ahead
and
says,
all
right,
i
will
do
it,
the
board
may
very
well
have
a
complaint
for
her
failure
to
conform
to
the
board's
regulations
by...
by
registering
the
firm.
but
i...
the
extent
of
the
possible
misleading
of
the
public
in
your
answer,
it
seems
to
me,
is...
is
in
the
suggestion
that
might
lead
them
to
call
her
up
and
get
a
"no"
answer.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
i
think
my
point
was
that
what
you
call
misleading
does
not
run
a
very
high
risk
of
anybody
being
seriously
misled
in
any
way
that's
going
to
harm
them
unless
she
goes
a
further
step
and
starts
performing
acts
which
she
is
not...
which
she
is
not
licensed
to
do.
and
your
claim
is
not
that
she
has
performed
acts,
but
simply
that
the
advertising
is
misleading.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
she
could
have
on
her
card
attorney,
cpa.
that's
what
a
member
of
the
public
sees.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
it
that
a
member
of
the
public
would
see
differently
from
her
current
card
than
it
would
see...
i
mean,
if
it
gets
attorney,
cpa,
it's
still
going
to
have
the
problem
with
it,
well,
a
cpa
can
audit,
so
i'll
call
her
up
and
ask
her
to
audit.
i
don't
see
the
difference
from
the
public
perception
in
a
card
that
says
attorney,
cpa,
and
a
card
that
says
what
this
card
says,
in
terms
of
misleading
or
deception
of
the
public.
unknown
speaker
through
the?
unknown
speaker
my,
that's
a
very
refined
misleading.
the
public
is
going
to
think
that
she
can
provide
the
services
through
the
association
instead
of
individually.
and
this
is
what
the
board
is
protecting
the
public
against?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
this,
to
be
sure,
the
card
i
guess
is
at
page
five
of
the
joint
appendix
and
it
gives
her
name
and
her...
her
degrees
and
so
forth,
and
then
says
law
offices,
and
then
silvia
s.
ibanez,
p.a.
now,
if
after
the
words
"law
offices",
there
were
a
parenthesis,
and
said
not
engaged
in
public
accounting,
parenthesis,
then
you'd
have
no
problem?
unknown
speaker
you
are
engaged
in
accounting
if
you
are...
if
you
are...
if
you
are
an
accountant
and
practice
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
distinctively
accounting
services,
whatever
the
board
chooses
to
define
as
accounting
services...
if
you
do
those
acts
and
are
an
accountant.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
board
could
say
that
just
addition
and
subtraction
are
accounting
skills
and
that
anyone
who
performs
addition
and
subtraction
and
has
a
cpa
is
practicing
accounting
if
it
wants?
unknown
speaker
it
hasn't
moved
to
that
yet?
unknown
speaker
so,
where...
so,
where
we
are
is
this:
if
john
doe,
who
is
an
attorney
and
not
an
accountant,
and
has
simply
advertises
that
he's
an
attorney,
does
exactly
what
ms.
ibanez
is
doing,
the
board
has
no
problem?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
the
minute
you
have
a
double
qualification
and
you
advise
the
public
that
you
are
also
a
cpa,
then
that's
prohibited?
unknown
speaker
so...
so,
what
you
are
accomplishing
in
order
to
protect
the
public
is
not
allowing
her
to
disclose
her
additional
qualification?
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
is:
that
protects
the
public?
unknown
speaker
and
those
other
requirements
are
to
get
a
license
for
the
firm?
unknown
speaker
well,
she...
as
i...
i'm
sorry--
--what
is
entailed
in
getting
a
license
for
the
firm?
i
mean,
are
there
qualification
examinations
for
the
firm
that
are
different
from
her
individually?
unknown
speaker
does
an
individual
seeking
a
cpa
license
have
to
provide
proof
of
insurance?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
under
no
circumstance
is
she...
could
she
add
the
cfp
designation,
because,
as
i
understand
it,
one
of
the
regs
is
that
one
may
not
add
any
term...
and
i
presume
any
abbreviation
indicating
a
term...
with
the
word
"certified"
on
it
if
the
certification
is
not
a
state
certification?
so,
the...
the
prohibition
on
that,
i
take
it,
is
absolute?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean
that's...
that's
the...
that's
the
only
way
she
wants
to
use
it.
so,
if
she
holds
herself
out
as
a
cpa,
assuming
she
may
otherwise
do
that,
i
take
it
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which
she
could
also
add
cfp?
unknown
speaker
but
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
that
was
under
a
separate
section.
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
unknown
speaker
that...
that
applies
to
the...
to
the
prohibition
against
using
the
term
"certify"?
unknown
speaker
and
which...
which
section
is
the
provision
for
board
approval
of
a
deviation
here?
is
that
under
(g)?
(i).
unknown
speaker
how
has
the
board
made
this
known?
is
it
in
a
separate
reg,
or
informal
announcements
or
what?
unknown
speaker
is...
is...
does
the
record...
excuse
me...
does
the
record
contain
any
citation
to
any
formal
opinion
in
which
it...
the
board
has
indicated
that
(i)
is
subject
to
this
dispensation?
unknown
speaker
it
is--
unknown
speaker
--but
does
the...
does
the
hearing
officer's
finding
cite
one
of
the...
the
letter
rulings?
i...
i
don't
want
to
take
a
lot
of
your
time
if
you're
not
sure.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
had
there
been
a...
the
disclaimer,
which
you
see
as
required
under
the
rule,
she
would
have
been
in
compliance?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
you
look
at
the
rule...
the
regulation...
on
its
face,
it
says
in
(i)
that
use
of
the
word
"certified"
is
prohibited.
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
i
mean,
you're...
you're
here
today
telling
us,
don't
pay
any
attention
to
what
the
regulation
says,
because
maybe
she
could
have
done
something
else,
and
maybe
the
board
would
have
authorized
it.
is
that
what
i'm
hearing
you
saying?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
board
seem...
the...
the
regulation
seems
clear
on
its
face
as
a
ban.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
can't
be
misleading
then.
i
mean,
if
i
don't
know
what
it
means,
i'm
not
being
misled.
[laughter]
the
only...
the
only
person
who
is...
how
can
you
possibly
be
misled
if
you
have
no
idea
what
it
means?
unknown
speaker
but
her
card
doesn't
say
c.>
["]--
--"c",
they
don't
know
what
"c"--
--maybe
that
means
college
of
something
or
other.
[laughter]
could
somebody
who
is
in
an
accounting
firm
advertise...
and
let's
assume
it's
truthful...
on
the
card,
in
the
yellow
pages,
j.d.?
unknown
speaker
this
is
somebody
who
is
in
a
firm
that's
qualified
to
do
audit
and
attest
and
all
the
rest,
and
that
person
has
whatever
is
the
designation
of
the
accounting
firm
and
then
j.d.--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's...
well,
you
don't
care
because
that's
another
profession
and
you
don't
care
about
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
go
back
to
an
earlier
question?
assuming
just
for
the
sake
of
argument...
and
maybe
more
than
just
for
the
sake
of
argument...
that
the
board
has
these
interests
and
that
some
of
the
objectives
are
perfectly
legitimate,
why
isn't
the
board
sufficiently
and
why
isn't
the
public
sufficiently
protected
if
the
board
simply
proceeds
to
revoke
the
cpa
license
of
the
person
who
does
not
abide
by
the
rules?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
can...
you
can
accomplish
everything
you
claim
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
accomplish
without
regulating
speech.
unknown
speaker
well,
who
cares
about
definitions
if
she
is
not
using
the
term
cpa>
["]?
i
mean,
if
you
are...
if
the
board
is
correct
and
the
board
revokes
her
cpa
license,
and
she
stops
using
cpa
because
she
is
no
longer
is
one,
then
why...
why
does...
why
does
an
abstract
interest
in
definitional
matters
help
the
public
one
way
or
the
other?
the
fact
is,
you
can
accomplish
as
much
public
protection
by
going
after
the
cpa
license
as
you
can
possibly
accomplish
even
on
the
rosiest
first
amendment
view
to
you
of
trying
to
regulate
speech.
unknown
speaker
and
if
she
didn't
quit
using
the
title
and
she
was
no
longer
a
cpa,
you
would
have
a
very
different
first
amendment
case,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
the
question
about
the
insurance
requirement
for
if
you
practice
as
a
professional
corporation?
unknown
speaker
is
it
different
for
a
lawyer
who
practices
as
a
professional
corporation?
does
the
florida
bar
require
insurance
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
you
don't?
unknown
speaker
i
just
wonder
if...
if
the
insurance
policy
she
had
with
the...
with
the...
to
protect
her
from
legal
malpractice
would
have
been
adequate
to
satisfy
your
insurance
requirement
to
also
say
you're
a
cpa
even
though
you're
not
practicing
accounting.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mrs.
nelson.
ms.
ibanez,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
could
you
tell
us
how
one
does
go
about
getting
a
cfp?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
organization
that
gives
the
designation?
unknown
speaker
is...
is
your
failure
to
have
a
cpa
license
for
your
firm
and
to
comply
with
cpa
requirement...
i.e.,
insurance...
an
issue
that's
before
this
court
and
that's
before
the
board
in
its
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
was
it
an
issue
before
the
board?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
board's
order
was
not
predicated
on
your
failure
to
comply
with
requirements
for
cpa's?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
