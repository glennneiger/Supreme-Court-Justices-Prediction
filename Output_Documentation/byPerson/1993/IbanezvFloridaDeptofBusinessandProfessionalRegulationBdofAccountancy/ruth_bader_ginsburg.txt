justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
silvia
ibanez
is
a
lawyer
practicing
in
winter
haven,
florida.
she
is
also
a
certified
public
accountant
and
a
certified
financial
planner.
she
included
the
designations
cpa
and
cfp
along
side
her
jd
designation
on
her
business
cards
and
law
office
stationary
and
in
her
yellow
pages
listing.
for
these
communications,
the
florida
board
of
accountancy
disciplined
her
declaring
her
use
of
the
cpa
and
cfp
designations
falls
deceptive
and
misleading.
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
board's
action.
we
granted
certiorari
and
today,
hold
that
the
board's
order
censuring
ibanez
is
incompatible
with
first
amendment
restraints
on
official
action.
ibanez
truthfully
represented
that
she
is
both
a
cpa
and
a
cfp.
truthful
commercial
speech
is
subject
to
restriction
only
when
necessary
to
advance
a
substantial
state
interest.
the
information
ibanez
communicates
is
verifiable
by
the
public
she
seeks
to
serve
and
the
board
has
not
demonstrated
that
consumers
could
be
mislead
by
her
use
of
the
cpa
and
cfp
designations.
because
the
board
has
not
overcome
the
presumption
rooted
in
the
first
amendment
favoring
disclosure
of
truthful
relevant
information
over
suppression,
we
reverse
the
florida
court's
judgment.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
joined
by
the
chief
justice.
