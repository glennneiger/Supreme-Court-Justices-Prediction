ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
florida
board
of
accountancy
refuses
to
allow
her
to
advertise
her
status
as
a
cpa.
that
is
not
actually
the
case.
the
state
intends
to
demonstrate
that
we
are
here
because
of
petitioner's
refusal
to
offer
her
services
as
a
cpa
in
a
manner
that
complies
with
the
law.
although
she
is
individually
licensed
as
a
cpa,
the
firm
which
she...
through
which
she
provides
accounting
services
and
which
she
is
advertising
does...
is
not.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
your
honor--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--the
record
is
very
clear
and
ms.
ibanez
admitted
during
hearing
that
she
is
providing
exactly
the
same
kind
of
services
now...
tax
representation,
interpretation
of
financial
records,
representation
before
the
irs--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--yes,
it
is.
the
practice
of
accountancy
is
governed
by
a
title
act.
chapter
473
is
a
title
act
in
florida,
which
means
that
the
practice
of
the
attest
function
is...
can
only
be
practiced
by
a
certified
public
accountant.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
not
necessarily.
because
the
definition
of
the
practice
of
public
accounting
in
florida
has
two
components.
the
first
component
is
the
offering
of
accounting
services
or...
or
consultant
management
services.
the
second--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--if
it's
within
those.
the
second
prong
is
to
also
hold
yourself
out
as
a
certified
public
accountant.
if
you
are
simply
a
lawyer
who
is
providing
those
services,
unless
you
are
providing
the
attest
function,
you
may
do
so.
you
are
not
practicing
public
accounting
under
florida
law,
because
it
is
a
title
act,
unless
you...
unless
you
both
perform
the
service--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--that
is
correct.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
that
is
correct.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
if
she
holds
herself
out--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--if
she
holds
herself
out
as
a
cpa,
then
she
can
do
those
things.
but
she
must
adhere
to
all
of
the
regulations
under
chapter
473.
it's
a
two-pronged
test.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
that
is
true.
and
that
was
alleged
in
the
administrative
complaint.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
we
originally
did
have
a
charge...
or
the
administrative
complaint
was
amended
to
add
that
charge
to
the...
the
charges
against
her.
however,
it
was
withdrawn
because
the
hearing
officer
felt
that
that
amendment
was
untimely.
however,
the
conduct
in
this
case
and
the
speech
in
this
case
are
inextricably
intertwined
because
of
the
definition
of
public
accounting.
the
administrative
complaint,
as
it
was--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--yes,
they
could.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
they
could
do
that,
as
well
as
what
they
have
done
in...
in
raising
the
advertising
violations
here.
but
in
this
particular
case,
what
she
is
doing
is
advertising
that
she
can
provide
these
services
through
a
professional
association.
and
that
professional
association
is
not
licensed.
that
is
an
unlawful
act.
this
court--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
page
33
of
the
record,
in
the
allegations
that
are
in
the
record,
on
paragraphs
eight
and
nine,
it
specifically
indicates
that
the
respondent
provides
or
offers
to
provide
services
to
the
public
through
her
firm,
called
silvia
s.
ibanez,
p.a.,
which
firm
is
not
licensed
by
the
florida
board
of
accountancy.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
no;
in
the
record
itself.
i
don't
believe
that
the
administrative
complaint
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
but
it's
on
page
32
and
33
of
the
record.
and
the
respondent--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--that
is
true.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
those
are
the
conclusions
of
law
that
they
reached.
but
the
allegations
of
fact
that
were
part
of
the
complaint
also
indicated
that
the
respondent
holds
herself
out
to
the
public
as
a
cpa
in
this
unlicensed
firm
by
appending
the
cpa
designation
after
her
name.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
their
conclusion
was
that
her
advertisement,
because
she
doesn't
comply
with
this
requirement,
is
misleading.
because
she
is
misleading
the
public
by...
by
letting
the
public
believe
that
she
is
in
conformance
with
the
requirements
of
law,
when
in
fact
she
is
not.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
it
says
in
the
joint
appendix--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--yes.
in
the
joint
appendix,
in
the
final
order
of
the
board...
which
is
found
at
approximately
page
180
and--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--excuse
me.
on
page
185
of
the
joint
appendix
it
specifically
indicates
that
respondent
is
unwilling
to
acquiesce
in
the
requirements
of
chapter
473
and
chapter
21a,
florida
administrative
code,
by
complying
with
those
requirements,
which
are
the
requirements
in
chapter
473.
she
does
not
license
her
firm
as
a
cpa
firm.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
yes,
she
is,
individually.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
there
are
two
answers
to
that
question,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is
if
she
licensed
her
firm,
then
there
would
be
no
problem
whatsoever.
the
second
is
if
her
business
card
indicated
silvia
ibanez,
attorney,
cpa,
and
stopped
there,
there
would
also
be
no
problem.
the
board
has
absolutely
no
problem
with
the
designation
of
attorneys
and
cpa's
together.
it
is
her
advertisement
of
her
status
in
conjunction
with
the
unlicensed
firm
that
makes
this
advertisement
misleading.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
because
the
public
is
allowed
to
believe
that
she
can
offer
these
services
through
the
professional
association
that
she
is
advertising
when
in
fact
that
is
unlawful.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
your
honor,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
is
that
the
disclaimer
that
she
may
give
by
telephone
is
not
in
conjunction
with
the
advertisement
itself.
and
the
public
has
already
had
to
take
the
step
to
either
call
her
or
go
to
her
office.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
your
honor,
any
time
that
she
performs
any
of
the
services
which
fit
within
the
definition
of
public
accounting,
which
she
has
indicated
she
does
perform
through
this
firm,
she
is
committing
an
unlawful
act.
and
the
public
is
misled
by
believing
that
they
can
obtain
and
do
obtain--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
because
the
public
is
led
to
believe
that
she
can
provide
these
services
through
the
p.a.,
which
she
in
fact
cannot
do.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
through
the
professional
association.
and
the
professional
association--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--yes.
because
there
are
ramifications
that
attach
to
providing
your
services
as
a
sole
proprietor
that
are
different
than
those
from
providing
your
services--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--that
would
not
be
a
truthful
statement,
because
the
board
found
that
she
was
in
fact
practicing
public
accounting.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
if
you
provide
accounting
services
and--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--using
accounting
skills,
and
you
hold
yourself
out
as
p.a.
and
cpa.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
interpretation--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--no,
it
has
not.
[laughter]
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
none
at
all.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
only
if
you
do
so
in
terms
of
providing
those
services
through
an
entity
that
it
not
licensed
if
that
entity
needs
to
be
licensed.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
no,
she
may--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--she
may
disclose
her
additional
qualification
if
she
complies
with
the
other
requirements
of
chapter
473,
which
she
has
chosen
not
to
do.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
she
has
to
submit
an
application,
pay
a
fee
of
$150,
and
she
has
to
provide
proof
of
insurance
for
the
professional
service
corporation.
which
she
does
not
have
to
do
individual.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
no,
they
do
not.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
the
prohibition
there
is
only
in
conjunction
with
the
cpa
designation.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
it
is
not...
and
that
is
the
only
time
that
it
comes
into
play.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
no,
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
the
rule
specifically
indicates
that
if
she
were
to
seek
approval
from
the
board
to
do
so,
and
the
board
were
to
grant
that
approval,
she
could
certainly
do
it.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
the
board
has
also--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--no.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
it's
on
page
209
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
the...
the
board--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--actually,
it's
a
combination;
(i)
is
the
one
that
specifically
talks
in
terms
of
the
term
"certified".
the
board
order,
however,
made
it
very
clear
that
since
1982,
the
board
had
interpreted
that
section
as
being
a
specialty
designation
that
if
someone
sought
approval
from
the
board,
they
may
be
allowed
to
do
so.
in
fact,
no
organization--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--they
have...
they
have
formal
opinions
which
are
available
by
public
record.
it
was
also
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
hearing
officer
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
it
may
be
provided
through
their
newsletters,
which
are
required
to
be--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--yes.
and
the
hearing
officer
so
found--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--there
are
multiple
opinions
by
the
board.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
i
do
not
believe
that
they
specifically
cite
an
individual
opinion.
but
they
do
make
the
specific
finding
that
the
board
has,
since
1982,
taken
that
position.
and
there
were
multiple
exhibits
in
this
case
which
were
formal
opinions
of
the
board
that
were
submitted
both
by
ms.
ibanez
and
by
intervenors
in
the
rule
challenge
case.
in
this
particular
instance,
there
has
been
no
effort
by
either
the
parent
organization
or
by
ms.
ibanez
to
seek
approval
by
the
board.
in
addition,
the
board...
the
board's
opinions
have
indicated
that
this
is
also
treated
as
a
specialty
designation
in
many
instances,
and
a
disclaimer
is
available
for
specialty
designations,
which
would
indicate
that
this
is
not
a
specialty
that
is
granted
by
a
govern...
or
affiliated
with
a
government
entity,
whether
state
or
federal.
in
this
particular
instance,
ms.
ibanez's
advertisement
does
not
have
the
approval
of
the
board,
nor
does
it
have
the
disclaimer
that
is
required
under
the
rule.
this--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--i
think
there's
a
great
possibility
that
would
be
the
case.
she
should
seek
approval
from
the
board
directly,
but
i
think
if
there
had
been
the
disclaimer,
we
would
not
be
here.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
because
of
the
confusion
that
is
created
with
the
use
of
the
word
"certified".
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--yes,
your
honor.
however,
the
board
has
interpreted
that
these
other
avenues
are
available
to
her,
and
those
interpretations
are
available
to
the
public.
i
do
think,
however,
that
it
could
be
banned
in
this
particular
instance
because
of
the
confusion
that
can
be
generated
by
the
use
of
exactly
the
same
term
in
certified
public
accounting,
which
connotes
state
licensure,
and
the
term
"certified"
in
certified
financial
planner,
which
has
no
government
affiliation.
and
unlike
the
situation
that
was
presented
to
this
court
in
peel,
there
is
no
indication
on
the
advertisement
at
all
as
to
who
grants
the
cfp
designation.
at
least
in
peel
you
had
the
designating
authority
or
designating
agency
revealed
to
the
public.
in
this
case,
the
only
member
of
the
public
who
testified
at
all
regarding
the
cfp
had
no
idea
what
it
was.
so,
there
was
absolutely
no
public
knowledge
that
was
demonstrated--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--i
think
that
while
that
person
didn't
know
what
it
was,
i
think
there
is
still
the
potential
there,
at
least
a
potential
there,
that
it
is
misleading
because
they
clearly
knew
what
certified
meant
in
terms
of
a
certified
public
accountant.
they
just
didn't
know
what
cfp
meant.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
that
is
perfectly
permissible.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
the
board
does
not
seek
to
regulate
the
practice
of
attorneys.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
i
think
the
public
would
be
protected
in
that
particular
instance.
and
the
proper
course
in
this
case
would
have
been
to
charge
her
with
both.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
not
entirely,
because...
because
of
the
very
definition
of
the
practice
of
public
accounting,
as
it
is
defined
in
florida...
and
ms.
ibanez
has
not
challenged
that
definition--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--if
in
fact...
if
in
fact
her
license
was
revoked
and
she
quit
using
the
title,
then
yes,
that
interest
would
be
served.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
yes,
we
would.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
i
have
no
idea.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
working
for
state
government,
i
don't
have--
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
--as
i
indicated,
i
don't
know
what
the
requirements
are
under
the
florida
bar.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
however,
the
fact
would
remain
that
even
if
she
had
that
insurance
for
the
purposes
of
her
law
practice,
the
board
would
never
have
that
assurance
unless
she
actually
submitted
an
application
and
provided
that
information
to
them.
ms.
lisa
s.
nelson
and
they
would
therefore
not
be
performing
their
regulatory
function.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
we
would--
