ms.

s.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
an
important
commercial
speech
issue.
specifically,
whether
the
board
of
accounting
censure
of
petitioner's
truthful
communications
in
attorney
advertising
violate
her
first
amendment
rights.
the
truthful
speech
in
question
consists
of
the
cpa
and
the
cfp
credentials,
which
communicate
licensure
status.
petitioner
is
indeed
a
cpa,
licensed
in
good
standing
by
the
state
of
florida.
petitioner
is
indeed
a
cfp
licensee
in
good
standing.
the
board
has
acknowledged
and
agreed
in
accepting
these
findings
of
facts.
the
board
says,
no,
that
these
truthful
communications
are
somehow
not...
are
somehow
misleading.
in
doing
so,
it
charges
petitioner
with
a
deceptive
advertising
statute
and
regulations.
it
does
so
by
using
a
contrived
rationale.
it
uses
a
complex
hypothetical,
an
irrelevant
argument,
that
attempts
to
transform
what
is
truthful
speech
into
violative
conduct.
the
record
is
devoid
of
anyone
having
been
misled.
the
record
is
absolutely
devoid
of
any
violative
conduct.
the
record
does
disclose
that
no
one
has
been
misled
as
to
petitioner's
truthful
speech
contained
within
her
attorney
advertising.
thus,
the
board
is
punishing
petitioner
for
truthful
speech.
there
are
no
charges
as
to
conduct.
and
the
boa's,
the
board
of
accounting's,
censure
of
petitioner's
truthful
speech
provides
no
latitude.
it
constitutes
a
ban.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
your
honor,
the
record
is
clear,
the
petitioner
has
maintained
that
she
does
not
practice
public
accounting;
she
practices
law.
she
does
this
by
choice,
because
she
is
authorized
to
practice
public
accounting.
the
board,
however--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
anyone
who
practices
public
accounting
or
doesn't
practice
public
accounting
is
subject
to
chapter
473.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
entire
record
of
the
rule
challenge
proceedings
clearly
states
that
petitioner
understands
that
chapter
473
has
two
different
layers
of
regulation.
the
first
layer
covers
all
cpa's
good
moral
conduct,
continuing
education
requirements
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
there
is
a
second
layer
of
regulation
that,
by
the
express
provisions
of
chapter
473
and
some
other
rules,
are
conditioned
on
the
practice
of
public
accounting.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
your
honor,
i
believe
the
record
is
clear
that
in
the
rule
challenge
proceedings,
a
lot
of
hypothetical
questions
were
posed...
that
was
not
the
disciplinary
proceeding...
and
the
questions,
i
believe,
and
the
answers
are
consistent.
the
record--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--your
honor,
it
appeared
that
initially
the
board
thought
so.
it
included
a
charge
in
the
amended
complaint.
but
even
after
hearing
petitioner's
opinions
in
the
rule
challenge
proceeding,
it
decided
to
withdraw
that
charge
just
a
few
mere
days
before
the
disciplinary
hearing.
the
record
is
clear.
so,
there
has
been
no--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--your
honor,
the
record
is
clear,
at
the
disciplinary
transcript
found
at
the
joint
appendix,
that
the
public
is
very
well
aware
and
informed
about
the
cfp
credentialing...
considers
it
quite
valuable.
mr.
robert
goss,
the
expert
witness,
spoke
about
the
hundreds
of
calls
that
they
get
about
referrals
from
the
cfp
organization.
it
is
a
national,
bona
fide
organization.
there
are
strict
requirements
as
to
a
comprehensive
examination
to
be--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--your
honor,
the
cpa
and
cfp
within
the
context
of
attorney
advertisement,
and
in
the
case
of
a
multiple-licensed
professional
such
as
petitioner
is,
clearly
could
disclose
some
disclaimers
in
connection
to
the--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
i
believe
that
the
state
could
certainly
require,
as
to
the
cpa,
some
disclaimer.
and
that
disclaimer
is
the
threshold
issue.
and
that
disclaimer
would
cover
the
cfp
issue.
the
cfp
issue
would
come
later.
because
this
is
in
the
context
of
attorney
advertising,
your
honor.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
your
honor,
i
believe
in
the
context
of
attorney
advertisement
the
cpa
credential,
which
is
the
credential
regulated
by
the
board,
certainly
the
board
regulate
for
some
disclaimer
language.
it
has
not
done
so
here.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor,
with
the
following
qualification
if
i
may,
because
it's
the
cpa
credential
that's
the
threshold
issue.
if
there
was
a
disclaimer
or
additional
information
required
of
a
cpa
licensee
within
attorney
advertising
that
would
say,
for
example,
not
engaged
in
public
accounting,
or
a
positive
disclaimer
that
says,
attorney
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law,
then
that
disclaimer
would
serve
as
to
all
other
multiple
credentials,
whether
petitioner
includes
two,
three
or
four
credentials
that
are
all,
on
its
face,
truthful
communications,
rather
than
require
petitioner
to
add
disclaimers
to
every
credential.
i
believe
that
would
only
confuse
the
public.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
your
honor,
petitioner
has
not
been
charged
as
to
whether
she
complies
or
doesn't
comply
regarding
the
allegation
of
unlicensed
firm
status;
only
when
she
is
confronted
directly,
and
not
indirectly,
can
she
be
afforded
her
due
process
rights.
and
then
there
can
be
a
conclusion,
and
not
a
summary
conclusion,
about
whether
she
has
violated
this
provision
or
not.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
board's
position,
chapter
473,
in
various
of
its
statutes
and
in
some
of
its
regulations
thereunder,
actually
counts
the
regulations
and
the
statutes
with
the
phrase
"only
if
engaged
in
the
practice
of
public
accounting.
"
so,
apparently
there
is
some
concern
from
the
state
that
in
some
areas
this
would
apply
to
only
cpa's
in
public
accounting
and
not
to
other
cpa's
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law
or
banking
or
other
professions.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
well,
i
could
possibly
think
of
one
example
in
the
area
of
contingency
fees,
for
example.
there
is
a
provision
that
says
cpa's
may
not
accept
in
the
form
of
remuneration
contingency
fees.
that
is
a
regulation
of
conduct.
certainly
the
board
can
regulate
conduct.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
it
has
an
ample
regulatory
arsenal
to
regulate
conduct.
it
has--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
is
not
part
of
the
record.
these
are
hypothetical
musings
of
the
board.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
no,
your
honor.
the
record
is
clear
that
she
was
never
even
given
the
opportunity.
the
board
uses
the
phrase,
"refuse"...
"she
refuses
to
comply,
she
refuses
to
comply.
"
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
she's
ever
been
offered...
first
of
all,
she
was
never
charged...
and
then
she
was
never
offered
to
then
comply
because
of
the
charge.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
she
could
not
have
refused
if
she
was
not
offered.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
i
believe
there
are
some
provisions
under
chapter
473.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor.
i
have...
i
have
no
problems
with
any
of
the
regulations
of
the
board
of
accounting.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor.
all
those
regulate
conduct.
and
i
believe
those
are
perfectly
permissible.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
excuse
me.
if
i
understand
the
question--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--i
am
not
quite
sure
what
the
answer
would
be
to
that
question.
i
believe
that
professor
john
sullivan,
in
the
rule
challenge
proceedings,
indicated
that
cpa's
in
accounting
practices
may
certainly
add
j.d.
or
esquire,
along
with
cpa.
so,
when
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot,
it
is
all
right.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
i
believe
it
is
constitutionally
permitted.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court's
commercial
speech
cases
in
the
area
of
attorney
advertising
clearly
articulate
the
doctrine
of
truthful
speech,
on
its
face,
passive
speech,
non-coercive,
relevant
to
the
listener...
because
the
public
interest
is
very
well
served
by
providing
them
more
information,
not
less.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
board's
position
in
its
order
is
clear...
they
use
the
advertising
rule,
subsection
(i),
which
is
an
absolute
prohibition
on
the
use
of
the
word
"certified".
subsection
(i)
does
not
give
leeway
for
adding
disclaimers.
in
addition,
this
case
represents
a
separate
discipline.
so,
even
though
the
case
of
peel
v.
illinois
regulatory
commission
certainly
applies
to
this
case
and
provides
protection...
constitutional
protection
to
the
speech
in
this
case,
it
certainly
goes
beyond.
we're
in
an
era
where
many
individuals
and
professionals
seek
higher
education,
seek
to
better
themselves
for
their
own
reasons,
but
mostly
so
that
they
can
offer
additional
competence
to
the
public.
it--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may
clarify.
because
there
are
multiple
licenses
here,
whether
there
were
two
or
three,
if
the
threshold
issue
is,
can
the
state
regulate
an
ad
or
restrict
the
cpa
credential
by
adding
more
information
and
more...
and
a
disclaimer,
certainly
that
is
always
a
possibility
and
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions.
however,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
additional
licenses,
to
what
point
does...
at
what
point
does
it
begin
to
chill
the
speech?
if
there
are
two
credentials
or
three
credentials,
is
the
professional
then
supposed
to
add
a
disclaimer
to
each
credential,
or
just
the
threshold
credential
that
the
board
of
accountancy
was
trying
to
clarify?
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor,
right
now
it
is
hypothetical.
the
board
could
have
chosen
that
route
to
add
more
information
to
the
cpa
credential.
it
certainly
could
have
regulated
a
disclaimer
or
an
asterisk
regarding
cpa.
it
has
not
done
so.
but
it
may
certainly
do
so.
and
that
is
a
more
reasonable
form
of
regulation
than
totally
inhibiting
and
suppressing
truthful
speech
that
deserves
constitutional
protection.
the
petitioner's
speech
is
truthful.
no
one
has
been
misled.
it
is
non-coercive.
it
communicates
valuable
information.
the
truthful
speech
deserves
constitutional
protection,
not
so
much
to
protect
petitioner,
but
to
protect
listeners.
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again,
it
is
the
listeners'
rights
that
we
are
protecting
here,
not
so
much
the
speakers.
the
public
interest
is
well
served
by
providing
disclosure
of
relevant
information,
to
help
potential
legal
clients.
and
certainly
this
is
the
context
presented
before
the
court...
attorney
information
in
attorney
advertisement.
so,
it
is
definitely
directed
to
potential
legal
clients.
certainly,
it
is
relevant
to
their
decision-making
process
in
helping
them
choose
a
lawyer.
the
federal
trade
commission
has
a
staff
report
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
regarding
the
additional
information
disclosures
that
should
be
encouraged
and
not
censured
when
an
attorney
attempts
to
help
in
this
decision-making
process
that
only
benefits
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
the
central
hudson
test,
which
is
a
balancing
test
well
known
and
applied
by
this
court
in
the
attorney
advertising
cases,
requires
a
balancing
test.
when
the
speech
is
truthful,
as
it
is
here,
and
deserves
constitutional
protection,
then
the
state
has
a
heavy
burden.
the
state
must
have
a
constitutionally
adequate
reason
to
suppress
petitioner's
commercial
speech.
the
state,
in
this
case
the
board
of
accounting,
has
not
met
its
burden.
as
recent
as
in
the
1993
decision
of
edenfield
v.
fane,
this
court
has
reiterated
that
the
burden
of
providing
substantial
government
interest
in
suppressing
petitioner's
truthful
speech
must
directly
advance
the
government's
goal...
in
this
case,
the
board
of
accounting's
interest.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
substantial
government
interest.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
substantial
government
interest,
i
believe,
answers
the
question
as
to
which
credential
should
this
additional
disclaimer
or
information
be
provided
to.
certainly,
the
board
does
not
own
the
word
"certified".
so,
whether...
whether
it's
certified
pilot,
certified
financial
planner,
certified
engineer,
it
certainly
cannot
be
the
word
"certified"
that
does
it.
so,
the
interest
as
to
disclaimer
and
more
information,
i
believe,
is
to
the
threshold
question
of,
can
the
board
of
accounting...
could
it
have
regulated
in
a
more
reasonable
way?
is
there
a
more
reasonable
fit?
and,
yes,
a
disclaimer
to
the
cpa
credential.
and
that
would
have
cured
any
possibility
of
potentially
misleading
effect
regarding
any
of
the
other
credentials.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
justice
scalia,
very
simply,
if
there
is
an
asterisk
to
a
cpa
credential,
not
engaged
in
public
accounting--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--that
would
cure
all
misleading
effects.
because
the
advertising
rule
says
at
subsection
(2),
this
only
applies
to
public
accounting
advertising.
and
this
is
attorney
advertising.
so,
that
disclaimer
would
cure
not
only
as
to
the
cfp
credential,
but
as
to
any
other
credential.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
your
honor,
anyone
looking
for
lawyers
has
found
a
lawyer
under
the
attorney
advertising
and
has
found
a
lawyer
that
complies--
[laughter]
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
your
honor,
i...
i
will
agree
with...
with
your
honor,
but
what
i
would
like
to
say
is,
if
the
florida
bar,
who
is
also
the
state,
regulates
attorney
advertising...
and
i
believe
we
all
agree
on
that...
and
they
have
already
indicated
that
the
credential
from
a
recognized
institution
is
all
right
with
them,
then
obviously
the
attorney
who
uses
cfp
in
the
bar's...
in
advertising
rules,
in
compliance
with
the
bar's
rules,
is
perfectly
in
compliance.
and
they
do
not
require
a
disclaimer.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor.
which
we
do
not
believe
they
are
misled.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
correct,
your
honor.
there
must
be
a
reasonable
fit
between
the
goals
of
the
legislature
and
the
means
chosen.
and
what
were
the
goals
of
the
legislature?
the
legislators...
legislature
spoke
clearly.
at
section
473.322
of
florida's
statutes
it
says,
a
cpa
who
holds
an
active
license
may
append
credentials
after
his
or
her
name
to
designate
status,
connote
status.
this
is
speech.
this
is
passive,
truthful
speech.
it's
not
conduct.
i
urge
the
court
not
to
travel
this
winding,
complex
road
with
twists
and
turns
that
the
board
of
accountancy
has
put
before
the
court
regarding
hypothetical
conduct
that
it
has
not
even
charged
petitioner
with.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
your
honor,
in
the
rules
which
are
in
the
rule
challenge
portion
of
the
proceedings
in
the
exhibits
at
r.
377
to
700,
you
will
find
rule
21a-20.006,
florida
administrative
code,
that
says
a
cpa
may
practice
as
a
sole
proprietor.
so,
if
a
cpa-attorney,
such
as
petitioner,
or
others--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--the
license
needs
to
be,
yes,
with
the
firm,
as
i
understand
it.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
your
honor.
but
that--
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
--correct.
and...
and
certainly
the
record
has
been
somewhat
misinterpreted
regarding
the
attorneys
and
cpa's
out
there
who
have
chosen
to
practice
dual
professions.
certainly,
those
are
practicing
dual
professions
and,
of
course,
need
to
license
their
firm.
that
is
not
the
case
before
the
court.
the
public
interest
is
certainly
well
served
by
protecting
commercial
speech.
why?
because
it
assures
free
flow
of
information
to
the
public.
in
turn,
this
helps
consumers
to
make
more
informed
and
rational
decisions.
it
also
encourages
competition,
which
benefits
the
public.
it
also
benefits
small
and
large
businesses
alike.
for,
in
this
marketplace
of
large
law
firms,
the
sole
practitioner...
the
small
businessman,
the
businesswoman...
needs
to
have
the
opportunity
to
truthfully
disclose
any
distinguishing
and
differentiating
factors.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
as
a
sole
practitioner?
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
without
being
incorporated?
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
possibly
the
board
can
answer
that
question
better
than
i,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
sole
practitioner
needs
to
be
individually
licensed.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
i
believe
so.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
the
public
is
not
easily
misled.
the
board
of
accounting
would
have
this
court
believe
that
the
public
can
be
easily
misled.
but
that
is
not
so.
that
merely
follows
a
paternalistic
argument
that
has
been
rejected
by
this
court.
the
public
needs
truthful,
relevant
information
to
make
informed
decisions.
and
petitioner
and
others
like
her,
multiply
licensed
in
good
standing,
communicating
truthful
speech,
should
be
encouraged
and
not
censured
for
disclosing
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
of
the
court,
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
comprehensive
examination
over
several
days'
time.
there
are
educational
requirements
and
components.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
it
was
called,
up
until
february,
the
ibcfp.
it
has
undergone
a
name
change.
it
is
now
called
the
certified
financial
planning
board
of
standards.
and
the
certified
financial
planning
board
of
standards
has
a
coordination
with
multiple
universities
and
colleges
and
institutions
of
higher
education
across
the
united
states...
i
believe,
according
to
their
amicus
brief,
over
50
at
this
point...
that,
in
coordination
with
the
universities,
there
is
an
educational
component
and,
at
the
end
of
all
the
educational
requirements
having
been
met,
then
there
is
a
certification
component.
the
certified
financial
planning
board
is
a
national
licensing
nonprofit
body.
it
has
a
federal
trademark
over
the
use
of
cfp
and
over
the
use
of
certified
financial
planner.
and
there
are
a
code
of
ethics
to
comply
with,
which
are
also
in
the
record...
were
submitted
in
the
disciplinary
hearing,
a
strict
code
of
ethics.
there
are
also
continuing
education
requirements
to
ensure
that
the
cfp
licensee
continues
to
stay
up
to
date
and
continues
to
stay
informed.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
an
issue
before
this
court.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
no,
your
honor.
those
are
hypothetical
situations
that
could
have
been
confronted
in
this
case.
ms.
silvia
s.
ibanez
as
i
understand
it,
no,
your
honor.
they
also
made
reference
to
forgoing
certain
remuneration.
that
was
also
hypothetical...
at
the
same
record
page
that
counselor
nelson
already
cited
to.
these
were
hypothetical.
in
the
footnote
to
that
same
record
reference
it
said,
it
could
have
simply
charged
petitioner.
indeed,
why
did
it
not?
in
such
a
confrontation
there
would
have
been
some
complex
regulatory
determinations.
and
the
florida
bar's
conflict
with
the
rules,
and
the
cpa
board's
rules.
and
out
of
that
there
would
have
been
some...
some,
i'm
sure,
some
rationale.
but
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
that
is
another
case
for
another
day.
it
is
not
the
case
before
the
court
today.
the
court
was
asking
about
accounting
skills.
if
i
may
make
reference
to
one
of
the
informal
opinions
that
is
available,
and
the
court
may
make
public
notice,
in
1991,
early
1991,
cpa
price,
business
owner,
sole
business
owner
of
a
beauty
salon,
asked
if
she
could
use
cpa.
she
was
denied.
she
was
told
because
she
offered
services
to
the
public
and
uses
accounting
skills,
the
beauty
salon
could
be
engaged
in
the
practice
of
public
accounting.
your
honor,
this
shows
that
this
is
an
absolute
ban.
this...
this
poor
woman...
this
cpa
business
owner,
who
is
owning
her
own
shop
and
is
indeed
licensed,
was
told
she
could
not
use
it.
petitioner
is
duly
licensed
as
a
cpa
and
is
duly
licenses
as
a
cfp.
she
has
not
refused
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
to
comply.
there
is
only
one
thing
she's
refused
to
do.
she
refuses
to
refrain
from
exercising
her
first
amendment
rights.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
may
it
please
the
court.
