ms.
french,
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say,
yes
you
can
attack
convictions
on
the
grounds
that
you're
asserting,
but
you
must
do
so
where
they
are
rendered,
not
concern
another
forum
many
years
later
that
doesn't
have
the
record.
why
can't
this
be
regarded
as
a
"where"
question,
not
"whether"?
yes,
you
can
attack
a
conviction
on
these
grounds,
but
you
can
do
it
on
direct
attack,
you
can
do
it
on
collateral
attack
in
the
state
where
it
was
rendered.
why
isn't
it
reasonable
for
congress
to
say,
you
have
those
other
avenues
of
attack
open,
we
don't
have
to
give
you
yet
another?
