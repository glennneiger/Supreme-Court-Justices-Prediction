93-5209,
custis
against
the
united
states.
this
case
involves
a
collateral
challenge
to
a
state
court
conviction
used
to
enhance
a
federal
sentence
pursuant
to
the
armed
career
criminal
act
which
provides
for
enhancement
of
the
sentence
of
a
convicted
firearms
possessor
who
has
three
previous
convictions
or
a
violent
felony
or
a
serious
drug
offense.
after
the
jury
convicted
petitioner,
darren
j.
custis,
of
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
felon
and
another
federal
crime,
the
government
relied
on
his
prior
state
court
convictions
to
support
a
motion
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
the
district
court
rejected
custis'
challange
to
be
used
for
this
purpose
of
his
state
court
convictions
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
with
the
sole
exception
of
convictions
obtained
in
violation
of
a
right
to
counsel,
a
defendant
in
a
federal
sentencing
proceeding
has
no
right
collaterally
to
attack
the
validity
of
previous
state
convictions
that
are
used
to
enhance
this
sentence
under
the
statute
known
as
section
924(e).
congress
did
not
intend
to
permit
such
collateral
attacks
and
none
of
the
constitutional
violations
alleged
by
custis
including
the
claim
denial
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
rises
to
the
level
of
a
jurisdictional
defect
resulting
from
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel
at
all.
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore,
affirmed.
