we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-5209,
darren
custis
v.
united
states.
ms.
french.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
french,
to
what
extent
do
you
think
our
decisions
in
federal
habeas,
where
a
state
defendant
is
raising
a
constitutional
claim
such
as
the
boykin
type
claim,
the
parke
v.
raley
case,
to
what
extent
are
those
either
informative
or
controlling
in
this
context?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
is...
we're
dealing
here
with
the
question
of
the
intent
of
congress,
or
whether,
regardless
of
congressional
intent,
it
simply
couldn't
authorize
these
priors
to
be
considered
without
having
satisfied
itself
in
some
way
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
in
connection
with
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
going
to
make
any
challenge
based
on
statutory
construction,
really,
logically
that
ought
to
be
your
first
line.
we
ordinarily
don't
reach
a
constitutional
question
unless
we
find
it
necessary
to
do
so.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
makes
much
sense,
that
line
of
reasoning?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
french.
the
case
is
submitted.
