ms.
mary
french
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court's
refusal
to
consider
the
constitutional
claims
in
this
case
had
a
profound
effect
on
the
sentence
that
was
imposed.
if
any
one
of
the
three
prior
convictions
had
not
been
counted
for
enhancement,
mr.
custis
would
have
been
facing
a
sentence
of
10
years,
maximum,
in
prison.
counting
the
three
prior
convictions
increased
the
statutory
maximum
from
10
years
to
life
in
prison,
and
also
triggered
a
mandatory
minimum
penalty
of
15
years
in
prison.
the
actual
sentence
of
nearly
20
years
that
was
imposed
was
nearly
double
the
statutory
maximum
that
would
have
been
otherwise
authorized.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
some
constitutional
claims
must
be
considered
during
sentencing
enhancement
proceedings
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
the
government
also
concedes
that
point.
the
issue
presented
is
which
constitutional
claims
should
be
considered
at
sentencing
enhancement
proceedings
under
the
acca.
our
position
is
that
violation
of
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
entry
of
an
unknowing
and
involuntary
plea
are
constitutional
errors
similar
in
magnitude
to
the
gideon
violations
which
this
court
has
recognized
cannot
be
used
to
support
enhanced
punishment.
i'd
like
to
cover
three
points.
first--
ms.
mary
french
--i
think
that
some
of
those
cases
can
be
informative.
generally,
i
don't
believe
that
the
habeas
corpus
principles
would
be
directly
applicable,
but
there
are
some
principles
that
might
inform
the
federal
district
court's
consideration
of
these
challenges.
ms.
mary
french
i
think
our
primary
argument
is
that
the
constitution
requires
that
these
claims
be
considered.
in
terms
of
the
statute,
it
doesn't
authorize
challenges
or
prohibit
challenges,
but
if
you
look
at
the
backdrop
against
which
it
was
enacted,
the
federal
courts
had
been
allowing
challenges
for
a
number
of
years.
ms.
mary
french
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
our
position
on
the
statute
is
that
at
the
time
it
was
enacted,
it
was
enacted
against
a
backdrop
of
decisions
including
this
court's
decisions
in
burgett
v.
texas
and
united
states
v.
tucker.
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
statute
itself
authorizes
challenges,
but
we
are...
our
position
is
that
because
of
that
backdrop,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
abrogate
federal
court
review
of
prior
convictions,
then
it
would
have
made
that
intent
express,
and
so
that
is
our
position
on
the
statute.
established
principles
forbid
the
imposition
of
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
based
on
prior
convictions
that
are
obtained
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
this
court
in
burgett
v.
texas
ruled
that
a
prior
uncounseled
conviction
cannot
be
used
to
support
guilt
of
another
offense,
and
the
court's
reasoning
in
burgett
was
essentially
that
to
use
a
conviction
in
that
manner
would
erode
the
original
constitutional
right
and
would
also
force
the
defendant
to
suffer
anew
from
that
violation.
ms.
mary
french
i
think
it
does,
your
honor,
because
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
essentially
what
those
courts
held
is
that
it
simply
does
not
matter
if
the
defendant...
if
the
defendant's
prior
conviction
resulted
from
a
constitutional
violation,
and
therefore
they
would
require
that
the
district
court
ignore
any
constitutional
violations
that
took
place.
and
so
in
that
sense,
doing
that
would
erode
the
original
constitutional
right,
and
in
terms
of
the
defendant
suffering
anew,
i
think
it's
clear
in
this
case,
because
of
the
direct
impact
that
counting
the
prior
convictions
had,
that
it
clearly
increased
the
statutory
maximum
as
well
as
invoked
a
mandatory
minimum,
so
for
those
reasons,
that
reasoning
would
apply
in
this
situation.
ms.
mary
french
your
honor,
congress
has
not
actually
said
that,
but
the
problem
with
it...
there
are
a
number
of
problems.
one
is
that
actually
in
maryland
the
maryland
courts
have
invited
other
jurisdictions
to
examine
the
constitutional
validity
of
prior
convictions
obtained
in
maryland
that
other
jurisdictions
would
like
to
use
for
sentencing
enhancement,
and
maryland
has
specifically
said
that
they
will
not
review
those
convictions
in
that
manner.
often
a
defendant,
by
the
time
the
prior
conviction
is
being
used
against
him
for
sentencing
enhancement,
he
has
no
avenues
for
state
relief
at
that
point,
and
so
he
would
not
be
able
to
bring
a
state
post
conviction,
and
with
respect
to
the
types
of
claims
that
we're
alleging
here,
he
probably
would
have
had
no
opportunity
to--
ms.
mary
french
--the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
are
not
generally
reviewable
on
direct
appeal
in
maryland,
and
that's
because
the
record
is
not
normally
developed
enough
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
that
violation,
and
the
same
is
true
as
to
the
claim
of
an
unknowing
and
involuntary
plea.
however,
mr.
custis
could
have
brought
a
post
conviction
action
with
respect
to
the
1985
conviction.
he
could
not
have
brought
one
with
respect
to
the
1989
conviction
because
he
was
never
in
custody.
ms.
mary
french
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
french
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
federal
habeas
review
that
you
might
be
referring
to.
ms.
mary
french
he
could
have
pursued
a
2254
petition,
and
he
would
have
to
be
in
custody
to
bring
that
petition.
the
problem
is
that
if
he
had
not
exhausted
state
remedies,
then
he
would
not
be
able
to
have
that
claim
reviewed,
and
so--
ms.
mary
french
--that's
true,
so
that
would
have
been--
ms.
mary
french
--that's
right.
ms.
mary
french
as
to
the
1985
conviction,
i
think
that's
true.
as
to
the
1989
conviction,
he
was
never
in
custody
for
purposes
of
that
conviction,
so
i
don't
think
he
would
have
been
eligible
to
pursue
either
type
of
review.
ms.
mary
french
your
honor,
lewis
did
not
deal
with
a
sentencing
enhancement
statute,
and
it
specifically
reaffirmed
burgett
and
tucker.
lewis
dealt
with
a
very
unusual
statute
in
which
the
legislative
history
was
clear
that
congress
had
intended
to
legislate
very
broadly
and
try
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people,
and
congress
not
only
prohibited
convicted
felons
from
possessing
guns,
but
also
anyone
who
had
an
indictment
pending,
and
so
there
were
other
considerations
present
in
lewis
that
are
not
present
here.
ms.
mary
french
congress
could
have
done
that,
but
i
don't
think
they
did
that
in
this
instance.
ms.
mary
french
well,
once
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
under
section
922(g),
then
he's
already
been
classified,
and
he's
been
shown
to
be
guilty
of
that
offense.
the
mandatory--
ms.
mary
french
--your
honor,
that's
true,
but
the
statutory
history,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress'
purpose
in
enacting
section
924(e)
was
actually
incapacitation.
in
other
words,
to
take
this
defendant
and
lock
him
up
for
a
minimum
of
15
years
so
that
he
won't
commit
these
underlying
crimes
such
as
burglary
and
robbery,
there
was
no
indication
that
congress
intended
to
classify
defendants
through
that
penalty
provision,
and
increase
deterrence
in
the
manner
that
you're
suggesting.
ms.
mary
french
your
honor,
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
that...
those
principles
aren't
applicable
here.
first
of
all,
i
would
note
just
as
a
factual
matter
there
were
no
judgments
of
conviction
introduced
in
this
case,
and
so
obviously
there
were
no
duly
authenticated
judgments
of
conviction,
and
that
would
be
required
to
invoke
full
faith
and
credit,
but
there
are
a
number
of
other,
broader
reasons
why
full
faith
and
credit
would
not
apply
here.
one
i
think
is
that
the
issues
which
here
are
ineffective
assistance
and
unknowing
and
involuntary
plea
were
not
actually
litigated
in
the
prior
proceeding,
and
there
would
have
been
no
possibility
of
litigating
them
during
those
proceedings,
because
the
violations
actually
took
place
during
those
proceedings.
in
addition,
in
maryland
there's
no
collateral
estoppel
unless
the
claim
being
heard
in
the
prior
adjudication
was
identical
with
the
one
presented
in
this
case.
ms.
mary
french
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
you
could
say
it's
good
in
maryland.
in
this
case,
we're
simply
asking
the
federal
district
court
to
examine
the
constitutional
validity
to
decide
whether
it
should
impose
an
enhanced
sentence
based
on
the
conviction.
the
only
reason
why
the
conviction
is
still
good
in
maryland
is
because
there's
no
opportunity
to
pursue
relief
there,
so
that
would
be
why
the
prior
conviction,
even
though
it's
not
technically
overturned
in
maryland,
should
not
be
used
for
sentencing
enhancement
in
the
federal
case.
i
would
also
just
note
that
normally
a
guilty
plea
is
not
a
valid
and
final
judgment
under
collateral
estoppel
law,
and
in
maryland
there's
no
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
in
criminal
cases,
so
for
all
those
reasons,
i
don't
think
full
faith
and
credit
would
be
applicable.
the
principles
of
burgett
were
applied
directly
to
federal
sentencing
in
united
states
v.
tucker,
and
the
same
reasoning
was
applied
in
tucker.
in
addition,
the
court
stated
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
sentencing
court
to
rely
on
misinformation
of
a
constitutional
magnitude.
ms.
mary
french
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
burgett
does
use
the
phrase,
v.
raley,
it's
a
term
that's
used
to
determine
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
placed.
in
other
words,
if
a
prior
conviction
is
obtained
in
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel,
then
the
burden
of
proof
is
properly
placed...
well,
it's
simply
assumed
that
that
conviction
is...
cannot
be
used
for
enhancement,
because
it's
just
an
intolerable
risk
that
it
is
too
unreliable
to
be
counted,
but
that
in
other
situations
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
properly
placed
on
the
defendant,
and
then
the
government
would
have
an
opportunity
to
respond,
so
i
don't
think
there's
anything
about
burgett
that
limits
the
challenges
to
convictions
that
are
void
on
their
face.
ms.
mary
french
that's
true,
but
i
don't
think
that...
i
think
that
when
the
term
void
was
used
in
burgett
v.
texas,
actually
i
believe
what
it
meant
was
voidable,
because
the
conviction
itself
would
still
be
in
existence,
and
in
fact
in
that
case
it
was.
it
had
not
been
overturned
in
the
jurisdiction
where
it
was
obtained,
so
that
it
would
be
incumbent
on
the
defendant
to
come
forward
and
have
that
actually
reversed,
and
so
i
don't
think
that
that
distinction
was
intended
to
limit
or
draw
the
line
on
which
claims
could
be
considered.
it's
true
that
if
it's
a
jurisdictional
defect,
then
it
would
be
deemed
void
and
not
just
voidable,
but
the
constitutional
claims
that
are
brought
in
federal
sentencing
proceedings
have
never
been
limited
in
that
fashion.
in
fact,
i
would
just
note
that
burgett
referred
to
other
constitutional
errors
prior
to
stating
the
holding,
there
was
some
discussion
about
other
constitutional
errors
that
are
applicable
or
constitutional
rights
that
have
been
applied
to
the
states
that
would
be
considered
limitations
on
state
court
sentencing.
the
government
has
argued
that
the
structural
defect
test
should
be
used
in
order
to
determine
which
claims
should
be
considered
in
federal
sentencing
proceedings.
we
believe
there's
a
critical
flaw
in
the
use
of
that
test
as
a
threshold
test
to
determine
which
claims
should
be
heard.
the
structural
defect
test
doesn't
identify
all
errors
that
undermine
the
reliability
of
a
conviction.
instead,
that
test
was
designed
to
determine
which
errors
would
require
automatic
reversal
and
not
be
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis,
and
the
fact
that
an
error
is
not
a
structural
defect
does
not
mean
that
it
doesn't
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
conviction,
and
as
an
example,
i
would
just
point
to
a
case
where
a
coerced
confession
was
introduced
against
a
defendant
and
was
the
chief
or
sole
evidence
against
the
defendant.
in
that
instance,
that
error
is
not
considered
structural,
and
it
would
be
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis,
but
it
would
be
deemed
to
be
harmful,
and
therefore
the
resulting
conviction
would
be
unreliable,
and
that's
an
error
that
should
be
recognized
in
federal
sentencing
proceedings
under
the
acca.
ms.
mary
french
i
think
that
could
be
true
in
some
cases,
but
certainly
in
a
lot
of
cases
it
would
also
indicate
that
the
resulting
conviction
cannot
be
relied
upon
as
an
indicator
of
guilt,
and
that's
because
generally
coerced
confessions
are
not
considered
reliable
in
and
of
themselves,
so
i
would
agree
there
may
be
some
instances
where
it
would
not
go
to
reliability,
but
i
think
in
most
instances
it
would,
and
the
claim
should
not
be
barred
as
a
threshold
matter
from
consideration
in
federal
sentencing
proceedings.
whether
or
not
the
structural
defect
test
applies,
we
believe
that
the
claims
that
mr.
custis
raised
in
this
case
should
be
reviewed
in
a
federal
sentencing
proceeding.
first
of
all,
they
do
qualify
as
structural
defects,
and
second,
they
do
undermine
the
reliability
of
the
resulting
conviction.
ms.
mary
french
your
honor,
i'm...
yes.
ineffective
assistance
i
believe
would
qualify
as
a
structural
defect,
because
in
order
to
establish
the
violation,
a
defendant
has
to
prove
prejudice,
and
that
means
that
the
defendant
has
to
show
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
result
of
the
proceeding
would
have
been
different
but
for
counsel's
incompetence.
in
the
context
of
a
guilty
plea,
that
test
would
be
that
the
defendant
show
that
the
error
had
an
outcome,
had
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
plea
process.
ms.
mary
french
well,
your
honor,
we're
not
advocating
that
that
test
should
apply
by
itself.
we
believe
that
structural
defects
plus
other
errors
that
go
to
reliability
should
be
recognized
by
federal
district
courts
in
the
sentencing
proceedings,
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
strong
argument
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
would
be
a
structural
error
once
it
is
shown,
because
to
show
that
claim,
the
defendant
has
to
have
shown
that
there
was
a
breakdown
in
the
adversarial
process
and
that
the
result
of
the
proceeding
is
unreliable,
and
that's
not
the
type
of
error
that
can
be
analyzed
in
light
of
the
other
evidence
presented.
ms.
mary
french
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
i
intended
to
say.
i
agree
with
your
view
of
what
structural
defect...
what
the
structural
defect
test
is,
and
i
think
it
just
depends
on
whether
you
look
at
ineffective
assistance
in
terms
of
the
requirement
of
proving
both
prongs,
which
would
be
the
attorney
incompetence,
and
the
prejudice,
or
whether
you
just
look
at
the
first
prong,
and
then
consider
this
second
prong
a
harmless
error
type
test.
ms.
mary
french
well,
that's
true,
but
i
think
that
in
addition
to
showing
that
the
attorney's
performance
fell
below
those
minimal
standards,
the
defendant
also
has
to
show
prejudice
resulting
from
that,
and
if
the
defendant
is
able
to
make
out
that
claim,
a
meritorious
ineffective
assistance
claim,
then
he
has
shown
that
the
result
of
the
proceeding
is
unreliable.
another
way
of
putting
it
is
that
it's
impossible
to
analyze
the
effect
of
that
error
in
light
of
other
evidence
presented,
particularly
when
we're
talking
about
a
guilty
plea,
because
in
the
context
of
a
guilty
plea,
the
defendant
has
to
show
that
he
would
not
have
pleaded
guilty
but
would
have
insisted
on
a
trial,
and
so
it's
an
error
that
would
affect
the
framework
of
the
proceeding
under
the
structural
defect
test.
ms.
mary
french
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
you've
met
the
prejudice
prong
of
strickland--
ms.
mary
french
--then
you
have
shown
harm.
ms.
mary
french
i
don't
believe
so.
there's
no
further
harmless
error
analysis.
ms.
mary
french
that
would
be
our
position.
once
you've
shown
the
claim,
once
you've
made
out
the
claim
on
the
merits,
that
there's
no
further
inquiry.
ms.
mary
french
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
any
suggestion
that
congress
intended
to
limit
claims
based
on
the
factual
inquiry
required.
that
is
the
approach
that
the
court
of
appeals
took.
i
also
don't
think
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
burgett
and
tucker,
and
i
think
it
would
violate
the
constitution
to
decide
which
claims
can
be
heard
based--
ms.
mary
french
--i
think
sometimes
it
would
require
more
of
an
inquiry,
but
other
times
it
might
be
a
similar
inquiry,
because
in
the
case
of
a
gideon
violation
there's
always
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
valid
waiver,
and
that
can
go
into
a
number
of
factors
about
the
defendant
and
the
proceeding,
and
so
i
don't
think
they
can
always
be
distinguished
on
that
basis.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
mary
french
i'd
just
like
to
briefly
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
are
cited
on
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief,
and
there
are
eight
circuits
that
have
uniformly
allowed
challenges
under
the
acca.
i
think
that
a
number
of
the
cases
that
mr.
bryson
was
referring
to
arose
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
and
there
are
different
considerations
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
including
the
fact
that
there
are
departure
provisions
available,
and
there
is
also
guidelines
language
that
governed
whether
challenges
were
allowed,
at
least
up
until
recently.
another
difference
between
the
guidelines
and
acca
cases
is
that
there
is
no
increase
in
the
statutory
maximum
in
the
guidelines
context,
where
there
is
in
this
case.
ms.
mary
french
a
federal
court's
decision
not
to
rely
on
the
prior
conviction
for
a
sentencing
enhancement
would
have
no
impact
on
those
proceedings.
there
would
be
no
judgment
as
to
whether
the
conviction
was
or
was
not
constitutional.
ms.
mary
french
your
honor,
i
think
because
that
would
not
be
such
a
direct
consequence
of
the
prior
conviction
as
use
of
it
would
be
in
federal
sentencing.
ms.
mary
french
it
could
depend
in
part
on
that,
but
i
also
think
that
the
decisions
in
burgett
and
tucker
are
limited
to
enhanced
sentencing
and
do
not
address
other
collateral
uses
of
prior
convictions.
ms.
mary
french
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
lewis
does
speak
to
that.
thank
you.
