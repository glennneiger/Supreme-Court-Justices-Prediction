why
should
we
choose
burgett-tucker
reasoning
rather
than
lewis
reasoning
to
construe
the
congressional
silence?
justice
souter
couldn't
we
take
the
position
that
just
as
it
may
be
appropriate,
or
may
have
been
appropriate
for
congress
to
identify
kind
of
a
high
risk
class,
as
in
lewis,
it
would
also
be
appropriate
for
congress
to
identify
a
very
high
risk
class
by
reference
to
three
convictions
and
violent
offenses?
