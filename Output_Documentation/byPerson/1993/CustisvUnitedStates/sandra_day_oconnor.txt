justice
o'connor
would
you
clarify
this,
because
it
may
be
relevant:
whether
under
maryland
law
any
or
all
of
the
claims
your
client
now
wishes
to
make
could
have
been
litigated,
either
on
direct
review
in
maryland,
or
on
some
kind
of
postconviction
review?
justice
o'connor
did
you
challenge
both
prior
convictions
on
the
basis
of
ineffective
assistance?
is
that--
justice
o'connor
--now,
could
he
have
obtained
federal
habeas
review
of
these
claims?
justice
o'connor
well,
he
was
still
on
probation,
so
for
purposes
of
being
in
custody.
justice
o'connor
but
if
there
were
no
state
remedy,
then
there's
no
exhaustion
problem,
right?
justice
o'connor
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
you're
here
saying
he
had
no
state
remedy.
justice
o'connor
so
presumably
federal
habeas
could
have
been
used.
