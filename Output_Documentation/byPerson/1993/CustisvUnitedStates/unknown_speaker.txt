unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
congress
could
simply
say
we
want
a
further
classification,
and
in
effect
he's
on
notice
that
if
there
are
three
convictions
that
satisfy
the
other
criteria
for
the
convictions,
he's
facing
this
significantly
enhanced
penalty.
it
increases
the
deterrence.
unknown
speaker
why
don't
we
infer
that
congress
meant
you
give
the
prior
conviction
the
same
faith
and
credit
it
had
in
the
jurisdiction
where
it
was
rendered
if
you
want
to
get
it
upset
there,
but
unless
and
until
you
do,
then
this
is...
the
conviction
of
the
state
of
maryland
is
in
effect
the
conviction
for
all
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there's
a
constitutional
infirmity,
it's
got
to
be
where
it
was
rendered.
if
a
judgment
is
good
where
it's
rendered,
it's
got
to
be
good
everyplace
else
in
the
united
states.
if
there's
a
constitutional
flaw
that
infects
these
convictions,
then
they
can't
stand
where
they're
rendered.
it's
strange
to
say
that
you
can
have
a
conviction
that's
good
in
maryland
but
not
elsewhere
in
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
burgett
limited
to
the
situation
where
the
conviction
is
void?
i
mean,
no
representation
by
counsel
at
all,
for
example,
clear
on
the
face
that
it's
void?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
in
federal
habeas
law,
if
you
look
at
johnson
v.
zerbst,
which
is
one
of
the
earliest
federal
habeas...
where
the
court
says
that
where
there
was
no
appointment
of
counsel
that
was
an
actual
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
court,
and
i
don't
think
we've
ever
said
that
about
other
constitutional
violations.
that
suggests
a
distinction
between
failure
to
appoint
counsel
at
all
and
any
number
of
other
constitutional
violations.
unknown
speaker
the
fact
that
a
court
were
to
determine
that
the
introduction
of
a
coerced
confession
was
not
harmless
error
would
not
necessarily
be
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
the
coerced
confession
made
the
conviction
unreliable.
under
the
definition
of
coercion
that
this
court
has
adopted,
there
are
lots
of
elements
to
it
that
do
not
necessarily
lead
one
to
conclude,
i
think,
that
the
statement
was
unreliable,
but
just
it's
not
permissible
for
the
government
to
use
this
sort
of
method
to
get
a
statement
out
of
a
person.
unknown
speaker
you're
suggesting
that
a
boykin
violation
or
a
denial
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
are
structural
defects?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
very
substantial
extension
of
what
we've
had
to
say
about
structural
defects.
unknown
speaker
ms.
french,
that
wasn't
my
understanding
of
what
we
meant
by
structural.
i
thought
what
we
meant
by
it,
and
the
reason
we
said
that
that's
the
criterion
of
whether
harmless
error
analysis
can
apply,
is
whether
it's
the
kind
of
an
effort
that
infects
the
entire
proceeding
so
that
you
can't
separate
out
the
harm
that
comes
from
it,
and
in
effect,
not
having
counsel
at
all,
you
indeed
cannot
possibly
tell
what
harm
came
from
it,
but
if
there
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
you
point
out
the
instances
in
which
he
was
ineffective.
he
didn't
get
this
witness,
he
didn't
get
the
other
witness,
he
didn't
interview
somebody.
you
can
tell
what
harm
came
from
those
things
and
whether
in
fact
the
result
was
harmless,
so
i
don't
see...
you're
using
structural
as
sort
of
synonymous
with
causes
the
result
to
be
unreliable.
i
don't
think
that's
how
we
used
it
in
our
past
decisions.
unknown
speaker
well,
it...
attorney
in...
it
isn't
enough
to
show
you
had
an
incompetent
attorney.
i
mean,
you
can't
bring
in
witnesses
who
say
yes,
i
practiced
with
this
man
for
30
years
and
he
is
really
incompetent.
you
have
to
show
that
his
behavior
at
trial
was
incompetent,
isn't
that
right,
and
you
have
to
show,
this
is
what
he
did
that
he
shouldn't
have
done,
or
this
is
what
he
didn't
do
that
he
should
have
done,
and
it
is
possible
to
identify
the
consequences
that
flow
from
those
particular
instances
of
incompetence,
hence,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
not
a
structural
defect.
unknown
speaker
are
you
using
prejudice
as
synonymous
with
harm?
i
think
the
two
requirements
may
be
quite
different.
that
is
to
say,
the
mere
fact
that
you
didn't
get
this
witness
introduced
would
have
prejudiced
you.
however,
it
still
might
have
been
harmless.
do
you
acknowledge
you
can
have
prejudice
that
is
harmless?
unknown
speaker
then
there
can't--
unknown
speaker
--then
there
can't
be
harmless
error.
unknown
speaker
so
then
there's
no
such
thing
as
harmless
error
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it's
not
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
say
that
things
that
are
obvious
on
the
face
of
it,
like
no
counsel,
you
can
use
to
attack
a
prior
conviction,
but
where
you
would
sidetrack
the
sentencing
forum
into
an
entire
hearing
and
investigation,
another
kind
of
trial-type
episode,
that's
not
what
congress
wanted?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
those
were
cases
where
the
absence
of
counsel
was
something...
you
had
counsel
or
you
didn't
have
counsel,
whether
counsel
is
effective
or
the
knowledge
the
defendant
had
may
require
an
investigation,
at
least
a
transcript,
perhaps
calling
witnesses,
quite
different
from
did
you
have
counsel
or
didn't
you
have
counsel.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
french.
mr.
bryson.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bryson,
isn't
it
probable
that
most
of
these
cases
are
going
to
be
challenges
to
guilty
pleas?
unknown
speaker
because
there
are
so
many
of
them,
so
the
real
question
is,
can
you
expect
the
defendant
to
immediately
appeal
from
a
guilty
plea?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
in
a
vast
majority
of
those
cases,
there
won't
be
any
basis
for
a
challenge,
either,
because
the
record
normally
shows
that
the
normal
procedures
were
followed,
but
the
problem
i
suppose
we
have
is
in
the
case,
the
rare
case
where
a
defendant
does
come
in
with
a
transcript
that
shows
a
very
plain
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights,
and
your
suggestion
is
that
should
simply
be
ignored.
unknown
speaker
unless
it's
structural.
unknown
speaker
why
structural?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
pick
that
as
the
test
for
your
exception,
rather
than
unless
it
goes
to
the
court's
jurisdiction,
or
something
of
that
sort?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
what
about
a
nonstructural
error
which
can
be
clearly
shown
to
have
been
harmful?
unknown
speaker
that's
certainly
not
worthy
of
reliance.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
my
basic
problem
with
choosing
the
structural
test,
because
in
order
to
decide
whether
there's
been
a
structural
violation
you're
going
to
have
to
search
the
record.
some
structural
violations
are
only
evident
from
the
record,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
i'm
glad
to
hear
that.
you're
not
using
it
the
same
way
we're
using
it
in
the
harmless
error
setting.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bryson,
are
you
taking
this
court's
precedent
and
trying
to
make
sense
of
it,
and
that's
how
you
get
to
this
label,
structural,
that
you
put
on
it?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
congress
have
followed
a
different
assumption,
because
when
congress
legislated,
you
not
only
had
burgett,
you
had
lewis,
and
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
congress
assumed
that
under
our
precedent
it
would
be
appropriate
to
overlook
a
constitutional
defect
only
for
the
purpose
of
defining
a
class
subject
to
a
primary
conduct
rule,
i.e.,
don't
buy
a
gun,
but
that
otherwise
a
conviction,
a
predicate
conviction
could
be
attacked
just
as
the
way
it
was
attacked
in
burgett
or
was
attacked
in
tucker.
unknown
speaker
then
why
do
you
concede
a
burgett
challenge?
unknown
speaker
if
we
do
not
reach
that
specific--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
sorry?
unknown
speaker
if
this
court
in
lewis
had
not
expressly
reserved
burgett,
then
i
assume
you
would
be
arguing
that
there
was
no
reason
whatever
to
make
an
exception.
unknown
speaker
or
had
provided
an
equally
legitimate
motive
analysis
without
expressly
reserving
the
burgett
and
i
guess
the
tucker
outcomes,
you
would
argue
for
a
lewis
analysis
and
say
that
that
in
fact...
a
constitutional
analysis
and
say
that
that
was
in
fact
the
only
one
that
was
consistent
with
the
congressional
intent.
unknown
speaker
yes.
your
language
is
better
than
mine.
i--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
bryson,
what
would
you
propose,
structural
in
the
sense
of
obvious
structural...
i
wish
we'd
get
another
word
so
we
don't
confuse
it
with
our
harmless
error
jurisdiction,
but
whatever
you
want
to
call
it...
obvious
structural,
hyphenated.
that
test,
it
seems
to
me,
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
as
a
statutory
test,
as
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
that
should
be
a
constitutional
test,
which
is
what
you're
posing
it
as--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
seems
to
me
the
constitutional
test
is
whether
the
trial
was
fundamentally
vitiated,
so
i
can
understand
jurisdiction.
no
jurisdiction,
as
a
constitutional
test,
but
once
you
go
beyond
that,
why
should
obvious-structural
defect
be
more
unconstitutional
than
less
obvious-structural
defects,
so
long
as
it's
a
structural
defect?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
mr.
bryson,
not
only
may
be
prejudicial,
must
be
prejudicial--
unknown
speaker
--or
there's
no
such
claim,
so
it
really
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
talk
about
a
harmless
error
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
unknown
speaker
now...
but
let
me
just
ask
one
other
question.
you've
spoken
of
the
enormous
burden
on
the
system,
and
that
is
something
we
must
of
course
take
into
account,
but
i'm
puzzled
because
of
the
briefs.
the
other
side
says,
there's
been
experience
in
a
lot
of
circuits,
and
there
really
was
no
significant
burden
on
the
system.
either
it's
a
fairly
obvious
violation
and
they
deal
with
it
readily,
or
it's
not.
you
argue
there
is
an
enormous
burden.
what
is
the
empirical
support
for
your
statement
that
there
is
such
a
burden?
unknown
speaker
because
in
all
these
cases
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant--
unknown
speaker
--to
make
out
a
strong
case
that
would
persuade
the
sentencing
judge.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they're
also
quite
difficult
to
put
forward.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
here
the
transcript
supports
it,
too.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
happen
every
day
that
the
transcript
actually
recites
those
facts.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
--and
then
he
talks
to
his
lawyer
again,
and
comes
back
and
says
he's
satisfied,
so
i
think
on
this
transcript
you
might
well
win.
unknown
speaker
but
the
thing
that
troubles
me
is,
they
shouldn't
even
read
these
transcripts.
unknown
speaker
when...
when--
unknown
speaker
--they
should
read
presentence
reports,
they
should
read
all
sorts
of
material
at
the
sentencing
proceedings,
but
not
spend
15
minutes
reading
the
transcript
of
the
prior
guilty
plea
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
an
enormous
burden.
that's
what
i...
that's
really
what
i'm--
unknown
speaker
--in
this
particular
case,
in
the
places
where
the
convictions
were
originally
entered,
it
was
too
late
to
seek
any
further
remedy.
that
is,
there
would
have
been
first
a
motion
to
withdraw
a
guilty
plea
if
we're
talking
about
a
guilty
plea,
and
then
a
direct
appeal,
and
then
a
collateral
attack.
at
this
stage
where
the
armed
career
statute
is
being
applied
in
another
forum,
is
it
clear
that
in
this
case
the
avenues
were
closed
off
in
the
places
where
the
convictions
had
been
entered?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
want
us
to
decide
the
case
on
that
ground.
unknown
speaker
it's
okay
so
long
as
the...
it
was
still
open.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
closely
allied
to
the
deprivation
of
counsel.
it's
the
same
constitutional
right.
unknown
speaker
and
it
requires
the
same
showing,
that
you
were
prejudiced
by
not
having
a
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
presume
prejudice
in
that
situation.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
the
additional
burden
in
the
other
case
that
you
must
show
the
actual
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
if
you
show
it,
is
there
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
oh.
unknown
speaker
haven't
we
taken
the
position
in
strickland
that
there
wasn't?
didn't
we
say
the
one
is
equivalent
to
the
other?
unknown
speaker
several
critical
mistakes
that
caused
you
significant
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
if
i
had
had
no
lawyer,
assuming
the
court
was
aware
of
my
right
to
one
and
i
hadn't
waived,
i
would
have
a
right
to
competent
counsel,
so
in
a
funny
kind
of
way
you
could
argue
i
would
have
been
better
off
to
be
standing
there
alone
than
to
be
standing
there
with
incompetent
counsel
on
your
view
of
what
i
can
attack
later.
unknown
speaker
but
what
it
all
boils
down
to,
isn't
it,
is
what
justice
stevens
said
a
little
while
ago,
the
government's
probably
going
to
win
this
one.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
case
that
illustrates
that
a
denial
of
counsel
in
fact
is
not
quite
so
bad.
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
may
be
difficult
or
it
may
not.
i
mean,
that
wasn't
my
point,
but
my
point
is,
why,
if
we
assume
there
has
in
fact
been
a
denial...
i.e.,
including
prejudice...
why
we
are
not
bound
to
equate
the
two.
unknown
speaker
but
your
answer...
and
i
think,
you
know,
it
may
be
the
right
answer,
but
your
answer
is
basically
a
confession
and
avoidance
answer.
your
answer
is,
well,
we
don't
have
a
principal
basis
for
distinguishing
them,
but
we
have
a
practical
reason
for
not
treating
one
the
way
we
treat
the
other--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
what
we'd
have
to
say,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you're
a
good
common
law
lawyer,
mr.
bryson.
[laughter]
mr.
bryson--
--do
you
agree...
excuse
me.
on
the
practicality,
would
you
review
for
us
what
federal
circuits
are
allowing
challenges
for
ineffective
assistance?
unknown
speaker
the
sentencing
enhancement.
unknown
speaker
on
this
question
of
the
distinction
between
denial
of
counsel
altogether
and
their
getting
an
incompetent
counsel,
do
you
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
that
so
long
as
the
lawyer
is
present
and
is
physically
breathing
that's
about
all
you
need?
unknown
speaker
if
we
were
writing
the
opinion,
would
you
suggest
that
we
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
gross
incompetence?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bryson,
supposing
the
district
court
in
this
case
took
all
these
convictions
into
consideration,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
could,
and
the
defendant
is
then
sent
to
prison
for
a
number
of
years.
under
our
malang
decision,
could
he
then
in
federal
habeas
challenge
one
of
his
earlier
convictions?
unknown
speaker
did
he
succeed
on
any
of
his
challenges?
unknown
speaker
on
17?
unknown
speaker
he
had
to
win
on
15
in
order
to
get
under
the
three,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
ms.
french,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
infirmity
of
the
conviction
for
purposes
of
impeachment
or,
as
mr.
bryson
just
brought
up,
talking
about
probation,
these
other
contexts,
where
it
would
be
to
a
defendant's
advantage
to
show
that
a
prior
conviction
was
infirm?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
open
in
the
one
case,
why
shouldn't
it
be
open
in
the
other
to
say,
you
can't
use
that
conviction
to
impeach
me,
it's
an
invalid
conviction?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
depend
on
whether
we
decide
it
on
a
constitutional
ground
or
a
statutory
construction
ground?
unknown

think

to
that
problem?
