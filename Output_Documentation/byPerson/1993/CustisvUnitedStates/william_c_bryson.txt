mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
first
address
the
question
raised
by
justice
o'connor,
i
believe,
as
to
whether
there
were
any
remedies
at
any
point
or
would
be
now
with
respect
to
the
two
prior
convictions
in
the
maryland
courts
or
in
the
federal
habeas
courts,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
the
first
conviction
was
a
1985
conviction
for
which
the
defendant
was
given
8
years...
i
believe
5
years
in
custody
and
a
3-year
probationary
term
to
follow.
that
8
years
was
still
running
at
the
time
that
he
was
arrested
and
charged
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
if
i...
although
this
was
not
a
matter
that
was
made
a
part
of
the
discussion
in
the
lower
courts,
nonetheless
the
presentence
report
indicates
that
he
was
charged
with
violation
of
probation
based
on
what
happened
in
this
case.
his
probation
was
violated
in
the
1985
case,
so
he
would,
given
maryland
habeas
law,
which
is
effectively
equivalent
to
federal
habeas
law,
he
would
have
been
able,
even
at
that
point,
to
go
into
the
maryland
courts
and
challenge
his
1985
conviction.
the...
of
course
he
would
have
been
able
to
challenge
that
conviction
at
the
time,
either
on
direct
appeal
or
immediately
thereafter
on
habeas
if
he
wanted
to
raise
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
which
was
raised
with
respect
to
the
1985
conviction.
with
respect
to
the
other
conviction,
the
1989
conviction,
we
do
not
understand
the
claim
ever
to
have
been
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
that
wasn't
the
claim
that
was
raised
in
the
district
court
in
this
case.
the
claim
that
was
raised
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
essentially
a
boykin
claim,
although
based
principally
on
state
law,
but
in
any
event,
that...
although
the
sentence
that
was
given
in
that
case
was
a
noncustodial
sentence,
nonetheless,
that
conviction
could
have
been
appealed
immediately
in
the
maryland
courts.
neither
of
these
two
convictions
was
appealed.
both
of
them
were...
well,
one
of
them
was
a
guilty
plea
conviction,
the
other
was
a
conviction
obtained
on
what's
called
the
stipulated
facts,
a
plea
of
not
guilty
with
stipulated
facts.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
a
lot
of
defendants
do
appeal
from
guilty
pleas,
particularly
if
they
don't
like
the
sentence,
but
the
real
question
is,
if
something
has
gone
terribly
wrong,
at
least
you
can
expect
the
defendant
either
to
appeal
immediately
or
to
come
back
with
a
state
habeas
or
federal
habeas
action
challenging
the
guilty
plea
at
some
point
if
he's
dissatisfied
with
the
disposition.
the
irony
here
is
that
the
reason
guilty
pleas
are
typically
not
challenged
is
because
of
the
reason
that
they're
tendered,
is
because
the
defendant
really
doesn't
have
any
quarrel,
or
at
least
understands
that
he
doesn't
have
any
legal
quarrel
with
the
state's
case.
the
basic
principle
that
this
court
has
recognized
again
and
again
is
that
if
you
are
pleading
guilty,
if
you're
talking
about
the
guilty
plea
case,
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
you're
talking
about
somebody
as
to
whom
there
is
no
serious
question
of
guilt.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
your
honor.
the
bottom
line
of
our
position
is
that
even
if
the
transcript
shows
something
that
would
be...
give
him
a
reversal
in
a
minute
had
he
taken
a
direct
appeal,
that
that
can't
be
the
subject
of
a
collateral
attack
at
the
sentencing
enhancement
proceeding.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
unless
it's
structural,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
it's
essentially
the
same
thing.
i
mean,
jurisdiction,
we're
using
jurisdiction
in
a
somewhat...
in
the
modern
sense.
we're
saying
that
the
denial
of
counsel...
we
start
with
the
denial
of
counsel.
we
know
that
that
is
the
kind
of
violation
that's
cognizable
in
a
challenge
to
a
sentence
at
sentencing,
to
a
conviction
that's
used
for
enhancement,
so
our
question
is,
well,
what
else
has
the
same
qualities
as
denial
of
counsel,
and
we
think
the
best
description
of
that
is
something
that
when
you
look
at
the
system,
the
scheme
of
criminal...
the
criminal
scheme
that
resulted
in
a
conviction
you
say,
that
scheme
cannot
reliably
produce
a
conviction
in
which
we
have
confidence,
and
i
would
give
you
an
example.
for
instance,
the
tumey
case.
you
have
a
system
in
which
the
judges
essentially
are
being
paid
piecework
for
convictions.
you
look
at
that
system
and
you
say,
that
can't
really
produce
something
that
we
are
prepared
to
call
conviction
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
may
be
that
there
are
many
things
that
happen
during
the
course
of
a
trial
or
in
the
guilty
plea
proceeding
that
would...
if
you
examined
the
record
would
give
you
confidence,
or
erode
confidence
in
the
reliability
of
the
ultimate
judgment,
but
the
problem
is
that
you
impose
at
the
sentencing
proceeding
an
enormous
cost
on
the
system
if
you
say
you
must
search
each
of
these
records
for
something
that
would
indicate
lack
of
reliability.
it
violates
basic
principles
of
finality.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
we
are...
and
in
this
respect
we
adopt
the
fourth
circuit's
view.
we're
not
talking
about
all
of
what
this
court
has
called
structural
errors
in
the
harmless
error
setting,
we're
talking
about
structural
errors
that
go
to
the
integrity
of
the
structure
of
the
criminal
procedure
that's
being
used.
in
other
words,
we're
not
talking
about
something
that
happens
at
trial
that
we
would
say,
well,
that
really...
you
can't
assess
this
for
harmless
error.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
we're
using
it
in
a
narrower
sense.
we're
using
it
in
something
that
much
more
closely
approaches
jurisdiction,
as
your
honor
noted,
the
traditional--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
we're
taking
burgett
and
trying
to
extrapolate
from
burgett
the
principle
for
which
we
think
it
stands.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
i
think
it
can
be
done,
and
i
think
it
is
something
that
each
of
the
courts
of
appeals...
there
are
five,
now,
that
have
essentially
come
to
the
same
view
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
done,
have
each
followed
essentially
this
path.
that
is
to
say,
burgett
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
something
is
just,
the
kind
of
conviction
in
which
you
can
say,
the
fix
is
in,
from
the
beginning
we
can't
have
any
confidence
in
the
outcome
of
this
kind
of
proceeding,
then
you
say,
that's
something
that
can
be
reviewed.
that
can
be
collaterally
raised
at
sentencing.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
i
don't
think...
i
have
not
been
talking
and
i
don't
think
that
the
petitioner
is
relying
principally
on
what
congress
did,
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
here.
i
don't
think
that
the
armed
career
criminal
act
authorizes
any
challenge
at
sentencing
to
a
prior
conviction.
the
language
is
clear.
it
talks
about
convictions.
it...
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
because
we
think
that
the
constitution,
by
its
own
force,
requires...
because
of
what
this
court
said
in
burgett
requires
that
you
consider
a
challenge
to
a
conviction
which
was
uncounseled.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
not
a
statutory
question.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
not,
in
our
view,
a
statutory
construction
issue.
that
is
a
pure
constitutional
question.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
this
court
in
lewis
had
effectively
overruled
burgett,
then--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
expect
that
we
would.
i
would
have
to
say,
though,
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
lewis
court
reserved
the
question
of
burgett.
the
lewis
court
distinguished
burgett,
and
distinguished
it
in
a
way
that
would
put
this
case--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
but
i
think
that
it's
important,
your
honor,
because
as
we
read
the
state
of
the
law
now,
burgett
is
still
good
law.
lewis
does
not,
i
think,
undermine
burgett
to
the
extent
that
we
would
say
that
burgett
is
just
a
dead
letter.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
what
we--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
for
these
purposes,
your
honor,
one
very
important
consideration
to
bear
in
mind.
we
are
talking
essentially
at
bottom
here
of
a
due
process
problem.
is
it
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
to
consider
a
conviction
of
this
sort
without
going
through
the
process
of
doing
a
constitutional
review?
when
you're
looking
at
a
due
process
issue
like
that,
one
consideration
you
have
to
take
into
account
is,
how
much
of
a
burden
does
it
place
on
the
system
to
have
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
review,
and
when
you're
talking
about
something
that
is
an
obvious,
on
its
face,
just
essentially
voiding
structural
defect,
then
that
doesn't
put
much
of
a
burden
on
the
system.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you're
talking
about
something
to
take
the
example
here,
like
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
which
it's
true
may
in
the
appropriate
cases
be
prejudicial,
you
are
talking
about
something
that
is
the
most
fact-intensive,
the
most
burdensome
kind
of
inquiry.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
it
is
hard
to
bring
empirical
support
to
the
court.
we
haven't
done
a
study.
i
have
anecdotal
evidence,
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant.
your
honor,
what
i
think
is
happening,
and
this
is,
i'm
afraid,
in
the
nature
of
anecdotal
evidence
rather
than
empirical,
but
i
think
what's
happening
is
that
gradually
defendants
are
becoming,
particularly
as
these
armed
career
criminal
act
cases
come
up
more
and
more
and
the
sentencing
guidelines
enhancement
cases
come
up
more
and
more,
defendants
are
becoming
more
sophisticated
and
realizing...
and
their
counsel
are,
and
realizing
that
there
is
a
potentially
fertile
ground
here
for
trying
to
disable
the
prosecution
from
using
these
kinds
of
prior
convictions.
these
cases
didn't
arise
very
frequently
for
a
while.
now,
what
you
see
is
applications
for...
or
objections
to
prior
convictions
based
on
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
invalidity
of
guilty
pleas
that
come
up
very
frequently,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
are
quite
difficult
to
rebut.
now,
i
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
isn't
that
hard
to,
your
honor,
because
consider
this
case.
who...
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
is
saying,
i
was
misled
as
to
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
were
here,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
the
possibility
of
my
having
a
defense,
the
defense
of
intoxication.
that
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
claim.
you
simply
say,
well,
my
lawyer
told
me
i
was--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
but
your
honor,
that
i
think
is
a
perfect
demonstration
of
why
it
is
that
this
is
a
potential...
a
real
potential
sinkhole
for
district
courts
to
get
into.
let's
talk
about
the
transcript
and
what
it
says
about
this
issue
of
drunkenness,
if
i
can
go
to
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--because
what
went
on
here
is,
the
defendant
was
asked
by
the
judge,
has
your
lawyer
told
you...
and
i
can't
remember
the
exact
words,
but
something
like,
about
the
defense
you
have
in
this
case,
which
sounds
like
the
judge
is
asking,
have
you
been
informed
that
you
have
a
way
out
here,
and
not
surprisingly
the
defendant
said
no,
and
then
the
judge
pursues
that
a
little
bit--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right,
and
something
else
happens
which
i
think
is
very
important
here,
and
again
it
pertains
to
how
much
work
it
is.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--time
and
time
again
the
pattern's
going
to
be
the
pattern
that
we
find
here.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i...
it
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
one
of
the
problems
is
that
in
many,
many
of
these
cases
there
will
not
be
a
transcript
of
the
prior
proceeding.
in
this
case
there
happens
to
have
been,
but
in
so
many
guilty
plea
cases
there's
never
an
appeal.
there's
never
a
transcript
prepared.
the
guilty
plea
is
evidenced
by
a
certified
judgment
of
conviction
with
a
notation,
pled
guilty
with
counsel,
and
that's
it,
so
in
the
great
bulk
of
cases,
all
you're
going
to
have
is
the
defendant
standing
up
and
saying,
my
lawyer
didn't
tell
me
everything
that
i
needed
to
know,
or
lied
to
me
about
what
sentence
i
was
going
to
get.
and
then
you're
going
to
have
the
defendant
coming
up
and
saying,
well,
i
don't
remember...
in
fact,
i'm
sure
i
didn't
get
the
right
kind
of
boykin
warnings,
because
i
remember
clearly
that
the
whole
thing
was
over
in
2
minutes,
and
the
judge
is
not
going
to
remember,
and
the
defense
lawyer
in
all
likelihood
is
not
going
to
remember,
and
in
many
of
these
cases
it's
going
to
be
a
case
that
comes
from
a
state
that's
six
states
over,
and
in
which
the
burden
of
getting
all
the
evidence,
even
if
it's
available,
together
would
be
quite
crushing.
so
it's
true
that
reading
the
transcript
might
only
take
15
minutes,
but
getting
the
transcript
together
and
getting
the
witnesses
together
is
a
very
burdensome
proposition.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
it's
not
clear.
as
to
the
1985
conviction,
which
is
the
one
that
was
challenged
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
involuntariness,
it
is
our
reading
of
the
timing
that
a
conviction...
a
challenge
could
still
have
been
brought
in
a
state
and
then
ultimately
the
federal
courts
based
on
the
continuing
custody
under
the
1985
conviction.
the
1989
conviction,
it
is
true
would
not
have
been
open
as
we
read
the
maryland
law
to
a
collateral
attack,
and
of
course
it
was
final,
so
there
couldn't
have
been
any
direct
attack.
on
the
other
hand,
maryland
does
have
quorum
nobis,
and
it
isn't
clear
that
the
kind
of
claim,
at
least
if
the
claim
is
that
the
defendant
was
deceived
into
pleading
guilty...
that's
not
precisely
the
claim
he
makes,
but
if
that
is
the
claim
he
would
like
to
make,
that
may
well
be
open
for
quorum
nobis
consideration.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
we
think
that
the
simple
constitutional
principle
is
that
with
respect
to
all
claims
of
error
except
for
burgett
and
closely
associated,
closely
allied
errors,
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
have
those
claims
relitigated
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
and
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
comes
from
the
same
basic
source,
of
course.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think
it
requires
the
same
showing,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
did
you
say
ineffective
assistance
and
denial
of
counsel?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
denial
of
counsel
doesn't
require
any
showing
of
prejudice.
you
are...
you
are--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
conclusively.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
and
that
is
a
huge
difference,
because
what
it
means
in
practice--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
the
difference
is
this--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
what
you
said
in
strickland
is
that
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
if
you
are
effectively
denied
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
that
constitutes
a
violation
of
your
right
to
counsel,
there's
no
question
about
that,
but
it
is
very
different,
and
in
a
practical
sense
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
difference,
between
saying
you
had
no
lawyer
and
saying
that
while
you
had
a
lawyer,
your
lawyer
made
several
critical
mistakes
in
the
course
of
a
trial.
in
other
words,
you
could
have
the
best
lawyer
in
the
world--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
exactly.
now,
that's
got
to
be
the
claim.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
you...
in
a
sense
you
would
be
better
off
in
that
you
would
have
a
claim
that
would
be
cognizable
which
you
wouldn't
have
had
otherwise,
but
there's...
to
return
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
anything
to
the
distinction
between
ineffective
assistance
and
complete
denial
of
counsel,
and
this
case
again
is
a
perfect
demonstration
of
the
great
difference,
this
1985
proceeding,
which
is
the
one
in
which
the
ineffectiveness
claim
is
being
raised,
was...
frankly
it
was
a
very
well
run
guilty
plea
proceeding.
the
district
court
went
on
for
many
pages
eliciting
the
waivers,
and
there
was
an
argument
made,
an
effective
argument,
there
was
an
effective
plea
agreement
for
the
defendant,
and
in
fact
what
emerges
from
the
transcript
is
that
the
strategy
that
was
obviously
the
product
of
consultation
between
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
in
that
case
was
not
to
go
the
route
of
saying
that
i
was
so
drunk
i
couldn't
possibly
form
the
mental
intent
necessary
for
burglary,
because
under
maryland
law
that
is
an
extremely
difficult
standard
to
meet.
the
strategy
was
to
take
the
opposite
tack
and
say
that
although
i'd
been
drinking
a
little
bit,
and
that
should
be
viewed
in
mitigation,
what
really
should
be
viewed
in
mitigation
is
the
fact
that
this
was
not
some
third
party
victim's
house
that
i
went
into
just
to
steal
things,
i
actually
know
these
people,
and
they
owed
me
money,
and
i
went
in
there
really
to
essentially
self-help
collect
on
a
debt.
now,
that's
not
a
legal
defense,
but
it
was
said
in
mitigation.
that's
the
strategy
that
they
had--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
what
it
does
illustrate,
again,
i
think
is
how
difficult
it
is
to
determine
whether
in
fact
there
was
in
a
case
like
this
an
ineffective
counsel.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
the
reason
comes
down
to,
if
you
want
to
put
it
this
way,
it
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
we've
got
a
due
process
question
here
and
we're
distinguishing
between
two
classes
of
violations
based
on
the...
if
you
want
to
call
it
administrative
convenience.
in
other
words,
the
difficulty
to
the
courts
of
trying
to
assess
one
type
of
error
and
another.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
it's--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
the
principled
basis
is
found
in
the
practical
distinction.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
practical
distinctions
are
on
principle.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
it's
complicated.
i
will
a
little
bit--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--there
are
several
circuits...
there
are
several
different
balls
in
the
air
here.
one
is
the
question
of
whether
the
circuit
allows
challenges
as
a
matter
of
construing
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
and
there
are,
i
think,
four...
at
least
four
circuits
that
say
yes,
the
armed
career
criminal
act
must
be
read
to
permit
any
challenge,
including
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
there
are
other
circuits
that
permit
the
challenge
under
the
sentencing
guidelines.
now,
that's
in
flux,
because
the
guidelines
have
been
modified
a
few
times,
moving
clearly
in
the
direction
of
saying
no,
no
challenges
authorized
by
the
guidelines.
there
are
other
circuits,
principally
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
really
the
only
circuit
that's
clearly
adhered
to
the
point
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
you
are
entitled
to
raise
all
constitutional
challenges
at
sentencing.
there
are
five
circuits
in
which
the
courts
have
said
as
a
constitutional
matter
you
are
not
entitled
to
raise
any
of
these
claims,
except
for
the
right
of
counsel
and
closely
allied
claims,
not
including
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
so
it's
a
little
hard
to
read
the
scorecard,
but
that's
what
it
comes
down
to.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's...
the
short
answer
is
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
i
mean,
there
are
cases
in
which
you
could
have
been
assigned
a
lawyer,
and
you
would
still
be
prepared
to
say
that
you
have
been
totally
denied
effective
assistance,
the
lawyer's
been
disbarred,
for
example.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
how
incompetent.
i
think
the
question
would
be
whether
the
lawyer
was
really
not
there.
if
the
lawyer
missed
every
day
of
trial
after
the
arraignment,
for
example,
just
didn't
show
up,
then
the
fact
that
you
had
a
lawyer
appointed
for
you
is
not
to
distinguish
your
case
from
a
case
in
which
somebody
didn't
have
a
lawyer
appointed
for
him.
if
you
get
into
distinguishing
between
incompetence,
serious
incompetence,
gross
incompetence,
then
i
think
you
have
invited
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
we
think
the
constitution
does
not
require,
and
that
practical
considerations
would
treat
as
being
just
an
enormous
burden
on
the
sentencing
process.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
our
reading
of
malang
is
that
he
could
not,
that
those
convictions
he
would
not
be
in
custody
on
those
prior
convictions,
although
there's
language
at
the
end
of
malang
that
leaves
open
the
question
of
just
how
you
can
challenge
conviction
a
when
you
have
been...
when
that
has
been
used
to
enhance
your
sentence
for
conviction
b.
if
i
may
say
one
more
word
about
the
practical
impacts
and
the
burden
of
this,
i
think
it
is
an
increasing
practice
that
we
see
increasing
numbers
of
cases
come
in,
and
just
recently
i
saw
a
case
in
which
a
defendant
had
17
prior
convictions
and
challenged
every
single
one
of
them,
and
it
is
not
limited...
this
problem
is
not
limited--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
actually
got
a
long
opinion
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
there
was
a
split
opinion
as
to
whether
he
should
have
been
granted
relief
or
not,
but
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
point
is
that
the
mischief
here...
well,
a
number
of
them
were
not
violent
crimes--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
managed
to
knock
a
number
out
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
violent
crimes,
others
on
other
grounds
and
so
forth,
but
he
got
down
to
a
small
number
and
attacked
those
on
constitutional
grounds.
but
if
i
can
just
make
one
further
point,
this
is
not
a
principle
that...
if
this
court
adopts
the
principle
petitioner
seeks,
that's
limited
just
to
enhancement
proceedings.
it
would
affect
every
sentencing
proceeding
in
which
somebody
wants
to
use
a
prior
conviction
just
as
a
factor
going
to
whether
the
person
should
be
sentenced
in
a
particular
way.
it
also
would
affect,
i
assume,
whether
a
prior
conviction
can
be
used
for
impeachment,
so
that
when
a
prosecutor
stands
up
after
the
defendant
has
testified
and
says,
i
want
to
impeach
this
guy
with
his
prior
conviction,
he
would
be
able
to
say,
oh,
no,
i
had
a
bad
lawyer,
you
can't
use
that,
and
you'd
have
to
have
a
proceeding
right
there
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
lawyer
in
that
other
case
was
ineffective.
i
think
one
other
area
in
which
the
same
practical
problems
would
arise
is
probation
revocation.
you've
never
been
able
to
challenge
your
initial
conviction
in
a
revocation
proceeding,
but
i
assume
that
if
the
defendants
are
correct
here,
the
defendant
is
correct,
then
you
would
be
able
to
in
a
case
like
this.
