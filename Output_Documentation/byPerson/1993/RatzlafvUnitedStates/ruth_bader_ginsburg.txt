justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
presents
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
federal
law
requires
banks
to
report
cash
transactions
that
exceed
$10,000.00.
it
is
illegal
to
structure
cash
transactions
above
$10,000.00
to
break
them
up
into
separate
transactions
to
circumvent
the
reporting
requirement
imposed
on
the
bank.
the
law
makes
it
a
crime
to
willfully
violate
this
prohibition.
defendant
ratzlaf
to
pay
off
a
large
debt
to
a
casino
in
reno,
nevada
purchase
cashier's
check
from
many
banks
each
check
for
less
than
$10,000.00
each
from
a
different
bank.
for
this
conduct
he
was
convicted,
fined,
and
sentenced
to
prison.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
ratzlaf
maintained
that
the
willfulness
specification
in
the
law
means
that
the
government
must
prove
he
knew
not
only
at
the
banks
reporting
requirement
but
of
the
prohibition
on
breaking
up
transactions
to
evade
that
requirement.
we
agree
that
to
give
effect
to
the
willfulness
specification,
the
government
had
to
prove
ratzlaf
knew
the
structuring
he
undertook
was
unlawful.
of
course
the
trial
judge
did
not
so
charged
the
jury.
ratzlaf
conviction
cannot
stand.
we
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
o'connor
and
justice
thomas
concur.
