justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
the
state
court
action
is
still
alive,
it's
not
dead.
i
mean,
if
that
were
completely
terminated
and
we
adopted
the
proportional
rule,
or
the
pro
rata...
whatever
you
want
to
call
it...
there'd
be
a
pretty
mess
to
sort
out,
wouldn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
the
case,
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
action
is
still
alive.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
what
do
you
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
mr.
markman,
you...
don't
you...
don't
most
of
the
jurisdictions
that
use
the
pro
rata
or
proportional
rule
also
require
good
faith
hearings?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
they
adopt
the
variant
of
it,
where
the
nonsettling
defendant
can...
you
know,
can
opt
one
way
or
the
other,
but
those
that
just
employ
a
straight
pro
rata,
they
also
have
a
good
faith
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
and
you're
willing
to
accept
that
disposition.
the
good
faith
hearing
doesn't
bother
you
in
that
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
but
with
a
proportional
credit
approach,
you
still
insist
that
there
be
contribution.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
agree
to
that,
but
do
the
courts
that
apply
the
proportionate
fault
rule
agree
to
that?
do
none
of
them
require
good
faith
hearings?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there...
if
what
you're
worried
about
is
fraud,
there
is
always
the
possibility,
even
under
that
system,
of
the
settling
defendant
being
paid
off,
in
effect,
to
participate
in
the
trial
in
order
to
shift
more...
a
higher
percentage
of
the
blame
on
the
nonsettling
defendant.
i
don't
see
why
that
system
dispenses
with
the
need
for
a
good
faith
hearing,
if
you
think
a
good
faith
hearing
is
ever
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
unfair
for
the
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
is
paying
for
the
avid
cooperation
of
the
settling
defendant
in
foisting
a
higher
percentage
of
the
liability
upon
the
nonsettling
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
good
deal
for
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
okay.
that's
the
way
the
world
should
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mann,
what
is
the
government's
position
on
the
variation
of
the
proportional
liability
rule
that
has
been
proposed?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
favor
that.
i
know
your
position
on
that,
but
before
your
time
runs,
just
tell
me
your
position
on
the
other
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
at
least
you
could
say
he
got
what
he
deserved.
