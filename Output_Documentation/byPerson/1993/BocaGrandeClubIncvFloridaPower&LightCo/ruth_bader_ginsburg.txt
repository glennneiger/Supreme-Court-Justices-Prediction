but
if
this
court
went
the
other
way
in
the
mcdermott
case,
then
wouldn't
the
great
lakes...
wouldn't
that
have
to
be
reconsidered,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
this
court
adopts
proportionate
fault
as
the
rule--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
doesn't
the
eleventh
circuit
have
to
rethink
its
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
great
lakes
would
essentially
be
wiped
out
if
this
court
should
adopt
the
proportionate
fault.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
some
suggestion
that
the
edmonds
case
impeded
the
eleventh
circuit
from
adopting
a
proportionate
fault
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
can't
the
plaintiff
argue
against
proportionate
fault
if
the
plaintiff
has
settled
for
less
than
the
settling
defendant's
share?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
there's
some
confusion
here.
you're
using
the
term,
pro
rata,
to
mean
something
different
than
proportionate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
isn't
any...
if
you
have
the
proportionate
fault
rule,
then
there
isn't
any
question
of
contribution,
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
when
does
a
good
faith
hearing
have
any
place
in
a
proportional
fault
rule?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
neither.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
of
any
system
that
has
the
proportional
fault
approach
that
has
its
extra
hearing
because
of
the
risk
that
the
settling
defendant
will
get
together
with
the
plaintiff
and
insulate
the
plaintiff
from
any
showing
of
fault
on
the
plaintiff's
part?
is
there...
is
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
position
is
the
one
that
most
deters
settlements
though,
isn't
it,
because
then
the
settling
defendant
is
uncertain,
is
always
vulnerable
to
the
contribution
suit.
