mr.
mark--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
i
think
what
is
perplexing
to
at
least
some
of
us
is,
why
outlaw
a
mary
carter
agreement
on
the
one
hand
and
refuse
to
look
into
the
good
faith
of
the
settlement
in
the
proportional
credit
situation,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
defendant
may
well
agree
on
a
proportionate
credit
settlement
to
do
precisely
what
is
outlawed
under
the
mary
carter
agreement.
he
says,
look,
i
will
go
into
court,
and
i
will
say,
there
was
absolutely
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff,
and
all
the
negligence
was
on
the
part
of
these
co-defendants.
why
doesn't...
if
a
court,
as
apparently
florida
does
inquire
into
the
legitimacy
of
doing
that
as
a
general
rule,
why
wouldn't
it
do
so
if
it
adopted,
or
if
we
imposed
a
proportionate
fault
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
we
don't,
but
why
shouldn't
we?
how
do
you...
i
still
don't
understand
why
we're...
why
a
court
would
distinguish
between
the
two
situations.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
knows
that
unless
some
court
is
going
to
say,
if
we're
outlawing
mary
carter
in
other
situations,
we
had
better
look
to
good
faith
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're...
you're
always
a
defendant.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
you're
always
the
defendant
who's
left,
rather,
i
should
say.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
that
the
same
interest
which
leads
courts
under
some
circumstances
to
outlaw
mary
carter
in
other
circumstances
would
lead
simply
to
a
mandatory
disclosure
rule,
and
therefore
you
can
adopt
proportionate
reduction
without
running
the
risk
of
adding
another
collateral
hearing
to
the
enterpri...
to
the
proceedings
before
they're
done.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
think
we
agree
on
the
separateness
of
the
question.
we're
just
wondering
if
we
go
down
the
road
of
proportionate
reduction
on
the
theory
that
that
is
going
to
simplify
proceedings,
are
we
acting
on
an
assumption
which
is
in
fact
true,
because
if
we
had
to...
if
later
on
we
found
that
the
courts
were
saddling
the
proportionate
reduction
rule
with
collateral
proceedings
to
look
into
good
faith,
we
wouldn't
have
gotten
quite
as
much
for
our
rule
as
we
thought.
and
i
think
you're
answering
that
by
saying
the
interest
that
might
lead
you
to
worry,
or
a
court
to
worry
about
the
terms
of
the
settlement,
does
not
necessarily
portend
another
collateral
proceeding,
it
simply
portends
a
disclosure
rule.
