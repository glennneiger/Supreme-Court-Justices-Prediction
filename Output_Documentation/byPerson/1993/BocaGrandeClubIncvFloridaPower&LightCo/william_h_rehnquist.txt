chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-180,
the
boca
grande
club,
inc.,
v.
florida
power
&
light
company.
mr.
pope.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
mary
carter
agreement,
what
you've
just
described?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pope.
mr.
markman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
would
the
issues
be
in
that
hearing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
good
faith,
at
least
to
the
uneducated,
of
whom
i'm
certainly
one
in
this
area,
sounds
like...
you
know,
honest...
honest
belief,
or
something
like
that,
but
i
gather
from
what
you
say
it
means
some...
it
isn't
just
to
see
if
there
was
a
fraud
in
the
settlement.
something
more
than
that
is
required.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
would
collusion
be?
what
would
amount
to
collusion
in
the
case
of
a
settlement
between
a
plaintiff
and
one
of
several
defendants?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
collusive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fair
not
just
as
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
settling
defendant
but
fair
also
to
the
nonsettling--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
agree
that
if
proportionate
fault
as
recognized
by...
is
adopted,
no
good
faith
hearing
is
required?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
defendant
always...
one...
jointly
liable
defendants
always
try
to
foist
liability
off
on
the
other
defendants,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
markman.
mr.
mann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
plaintiff
being
the
boat
owner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
that
if
we
adopt
the
proportionate
fault
rule
there's
no
need
for
good
faith
hearings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
jesus,
don't
give
us
another
version.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
a
television
show,
maybe.
[laughter]
thank
you,
mr.
mann.
mr.
pope,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pope.
the
case
is
submitted.
