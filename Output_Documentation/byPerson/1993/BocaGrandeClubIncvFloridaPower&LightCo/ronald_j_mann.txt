mr.
ronald
j.
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
lot
of
the
lengthy
discussion
that
has
gone
on
this
morning,
i
think
it
might
be
useful
to
step
back
for
a
minute
and
emphasize
a
few
points
about
the
fundamental
principles
relative
to
the
cases
before
the
court
today.
first,
the
court's
modern
maritime
cases
consistently
have
emphasized
the
virtues
of
a
comparative
fault
regime,
because
such
a
regime
tends
to
allocate
responsibility
in
accordance
with
fault,
and
that
in
turn
tends
to
give
all
maritime
actors
an
appropriate
incentive
to
avoid
accidents.
each
of
the
rules
that
mr.
kelley
and
i
have
urged
would
be
consistent
with
that
principle,
because
each
ultimately
would
result
in
solvent
defendants
who
do
not
settle
being
held
liable
for
a
share
of
the
total
damages
proportionate
to
their
share
of
the
fault.
the
second
principle
the
court
has
followed,
absent
congressional
intervention,
is
a
principle
of
joint
and
several
liability,
under
which
a
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
receive
all
of
its
damages
from
any
single
tortfeasor
so
that
the
tortfeasors
as
a
group
bear
the
risk
that
one
or
more
of
them
are
insolvent,
or
that
one
or
more
of
them
may
have
some
statutory
defense
to
liability,
as
in
edmonds.
again,
neither
of
the
rules
that
we
have
urged
today
would
undercut
that
principle,
except
in
cases
where
the
plaintiff
voluntarily
chooses
to
accept
from
a
defendant
a
sum
less
than
that
defendant's
proportionate
sum
of
damages...
share
of
damages,
and
in
that
case
we
see
no
inequity
in
holding
the
plaintiff
to
the
burdens
as
well
as
the
benefits
of
the
bargain.
now,
we
suggest
another
principle
that
should
guide
the
court
in
deciding
the
cases
today.
a
settlement
agreement
between
two
parties
should
not
have
the
effect
of
altering
the
liability
to
the
tort
claimant
of
third
parties
that
are
not
a
party
to
the
settlement.
now,
the
position
urged
by
petitioners
in
this
case,
adoption
of
a
contribution
bar,
is
the
only
one
of
the
three
principal
rules
discussed
in
the
briefs
that
would
lead
to
that
anomalous
result,
and
we
submit
that
the
opportunities
for
collusion,
together
with
the
alternate
ways
of
resolving
the
problem,
counsel
against
adopting
that
rule.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
collusion,
i
thought
it
would
be
helpful
if
we
explained
what
we
see
as
the
type
of
collusion
that
courts
are
concerned
about
in
this
area.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
a
simplified
version
of
the
facts
in
the
mcdermott
case,
you
can
see
the
problem.
you
have
a
plaintiff
who
owns
a
boat.
a
subsidiary
of
the
plaintiff...
we
can
call
it
hudson
engineering...
designs
a
device
for
picking
up
a
very
heavy
object
on
the
boat.
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
device
doesn't
work,
the
object
falls,
it
causes
a
lot
of
damage.
the
plaintiff
sues
everybody...
the
people
who
made
everything,
the
people
who
did
everything,
and
then
one
of
the
defendants--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--the
plaintiff
being
the
boat
owner
sues
everybody,
as
you
would
expect.
now,
one
person
who
might
have
some
liability
is
the
person
who
designed
the
sling
that
picked
up
the
thing
and
dropped
it.
now,
since
that
person
is...
in
fact
they
might
have
a
very
large
share
of
the
liability,
but
because
that
person
is
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
the
plaintiff,
the
plaintiff
could
enter
into
a
settlement
agreement
with
that
party
under
which
that
party
pays
$100,000,
even
though
you
might
think
that
the
damages
are
$10
million
or
$20
million.
now,
if
you
adopt
a
contribution
bar
rule
with
the
pro
tanto
approach,
let's
say
you
go
to
trial,
the
nonsettling
defendants,
the
parties
that
aren't
related
to
the
plaintiff,
there's
a
verdict
for
$10
million.
under
the
contribution
bar
rule,
the
verdict
is
reduced
by
$100,000
to
take
account
of
the
settlement
with
the
related
party
and
the
plaintiff,
and
that
leaves
the
nonrelated
parties
paying
$9,900,000
although
the
jury
might
have
found
that
they
were
responsible
for,
say,
50
percent
of
the
accident.
that's
the
type
of
collusion
that
we
think
is
unfair.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
no.
if
you
adopt
the
proportionate
credit
rule,
you
wouldn't
have
a
problem
with
that
at
all,
and
that's
what
i
would
go
into...
it
seems
to
us
that
in
choosing
the
two
rules
that
mr.
kelley
advocated
in
the
first
case
and
the
rule
that
we
advocate
here,
which
we
advocate
on
the
assumption
that
we
lose
the
first
case,
which...
is
that
the
rule
advocated
by
mr.
kelley
is
a
simpler
rule
that
reduces
the
need
for
collateral
litigation.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
yes.
i
guess
the
most
precise
way
to
refer
to
the
rule
that
we've
urged
in
the
first
case
is
the
proportionate
reduction
rule,
which
refers
to--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--no,
i
think
that
it's
useful
to
explain.
the
court
has...
i
think
the
reason
that
people
try
to
call
that
rule
the
proportionate
fault
rule
is
because
your
cases
say
that
you
like
proportionate
fault,
though
reliable
transfer
case
rejected
the
flat
divided
damages
rule
in
favor
of
what
you
can
call
a
proportionate
or
comparative
fault
regime,
which
says
that
everybody
is
liable
for
their
percentage
of
the
damages.
the
reason
we
call
it
proportionate
reduction
is
because
you're
reducing
the
plaintiff's
claim
proportionately,
and
if
you
do
adopt
that
rule
in
mcdermott,
then
it
seems
to
us
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
good
faith
hearing.
now,
the
issue
that
justice
souter
and
several
people
were
talking
about
towards
the
end
of
mr.
markman's
argument,
a
mary
carter
agreement,
that
seems
to
us
an
entirely
separate
question.
the
issues
before
the
court
today
i
think
have
to
do
with
how
you
account
in
the
claim
for
the
effect
of
a
settlement
to
one
of
the
tortfeasors.
now,
there
are
separate
common
law
rules,
and
i
would
presume
this
court
would
consider
on
the
proper
occasion
how
to
deal
with
a
situation
where
a
plaintiff
in
one
of
the
tortfeasors
enter
into
an
agreement
under
which
the
defendant...
the
settling
tortfeasor's
going
to
assist
at
trial.
in
many
states
and
many
common
law
jurisdictions,
the
rule
is
not
that
that
agreement
is
illegal,
the
rule
is
that
it
is
supposed
to
be
presented
to
the
fact-finder.
it's
discoverable,
it's
admissible
at
trial,
the
nonsettling
defendant
comes
in
and
says,
don't
believe
what
the
settling
defendant
is
saying,
he's
getting
paid
to
say
that,
don't
listen
to
him,
it's
his
fault
and
not
mine,
and
that
is
a
separate
rule,
and
the
court
as
a
matter
of
its
maritime
power
under
article
iii
could
consider
adopting
such
a
rule.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
you
certainly
can
do
that.
i
mean,
what
i'd
like
to
emphasize
is,
it's
too
entirely
separate
questions.
you
don't...
i
don't
think--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--that's
right.
i
think
we
would
believe
in
all
circumstances
the
best
rule
in
these
cases
would
be
to
put
the
greatest
amount
of
evidence
before
the
fact-finder,
tell
the
fact-finder
about
the
agreement...
i
mean,
our
system
rests
on
the
assumption,
true
or
not,
that
the
fact-finder
is
going
to
make
the
right
decision
after
being
presented
with
all
the
evidence,
and
i
think
that
really
takes
care
of
that
problem.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
guess
i'd
like...
there
seems
just...
there's
two
new
rules.
they're
not
really
new,
but
two
additional
rules
that
weren't
really
discussed
in
the
briefs
that
have
come
up
today.
the
first
of
them
i'd
refer
to
as
the
one-recovery
rule,
which
is
the
rule
that
you
seem
to
advocate
in
the
mcdermott
argument,
under
which
a
settlement...
you
would
have
a
proportionate
reduction
rule,
except
that
in
no
circumstances
would
the
plaintiff
be
allowed
to
recover
more
than
one
recovery.
you
asked
if
there
was
any
system
that
adopted
that.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
subsection
(3)
of
section
885
of
the
restatement,
second,
of
torts,
there's
a
suggestion
to
that
effect,
although
it's
not
entirely
clear
it
would
apply
here,
but
that
seems
to
adopt
something
like
that
rule.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
okay.
our
position
on
the
other
one
is
that
we
don't...
which
is
what
i
would
refer
to
as
the
election
rule--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--under
which
the
nonsettling
defendant
can
choose
between
the
pro
rata
and
pro
tanto
approaches,
we
don't
favor
that
rule,
either.
the
reasons
why
we
don't
favor
that
rule
first
are
that
it
seems
to
us
it
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
settlements,
because
it's
going
to
take
away
from
the
plaintiff
the
incentive
to
make
a
settlement,
because
if
the
plaintiff
makes
a
good
settlement,
he
doesn't
get
the
benefit
of
it,
so
it
certainly
is
going
to
decrease
the
plaintiff's
incentive
for
settlement.
a
second
problem
with
that
rule
with
respect
to
your
concerns
is
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
get
rid
of
the
one
recovery
problem
that
seems
to
concern
you,
because
at
least
as
i
understood
the
rule
that
was
proposed,
the
person
would
choose
immediately
after
the
settlement
was
made
whether
they
wanted
pro
rata
or
pro
tanto,
so
if
he
chose
wrong,
the
plaintiff
still
might
get
more
than
one
recovery,
and
the
third
problem
with
it,
it
seems
to
us--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
that's
our
view
of
why
we
don't
like...
we
would
disagree
with
the
one
recovery
rule,
is
that
the
plaintiff...
we
think
the
plaintiff
gets
what
he
deserves,
and
we
think
that
the
nonsettling
tortfeasor
pays
what
they
deserve.
the
last
thing
we
wanted
to
say
about
that
rule
also
is
it
seems
to
us
it's
rather
complicated,
and
you're
progressing
down
a
road
where
you're
making
up
increasing
levels
of
complicated
exceptions.
defendants
get
to
choose
between
this
rule
and
that
rule.
that
starts
to
sound
more
like
something
that
might
be
adopted
by
a
legislature
than
a
common
law
rule,
i
think,
at
that
point.
