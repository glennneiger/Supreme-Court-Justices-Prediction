mr.
stuart
c.
markman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
this
rather
advanced
stage
of
these
coupled
arguments,
much
has
already
said
about
the
three
possible
approaches
that
this
court
could
select.
we're
dealing
with
the
settlement
in
the
context
of
a
multidefendant
maritime
tort
action.
with
florida
power's
time,
i'd
like
to
focus
briefly...
very
briefly
on
one
key
and,
we
think,
critical
point.
in
the
event
this
court
does
not
adopt
the
proportionate
credit
approach,
of
the
remaining
options
for
dealing
with
partial
settlements
in
this
setting,
law
and
fairness
dictate
that
the
settlement
bar
rule
and
the
pro
tanto
setting
be
rejected
and
the
contribution
approach
adopted.
the
first
and
foremost
reason
for
this
position
is
one
of
simple
fairness,
and
it's
been
discussed
and
alluded
to
today.
the
settlement
bar
rule
tends
to
disrupt
the
normal
litigation
incentives
and
the
pattern
of
risks.
that
is
to
say,
the
settlement
bar
rule
creates
an
incentive
for
the
settling
parties
to
saddle
the
nonsettling
defendant
with
an
amount
of
liability
or
culpability
that
far
exceeds
its
true
share.
the
settling
defendant
is
willing
to
settle
at
a
deep
discount.
the
settling
plaintiff
may
be
willing
to
extend
that
deep
discount
because
it
knows,
as
a
certainty
under
the
pro
rata
settlement
bar
rule,
that
any
shortfall
or
any
bad
bargain
it
entered
into,
has
to
be
made
up
by
the
nonsettling
defendant.
the
net
result
is
that
the
nonsettling
defendant
will
bear
the
burden
of
a
settlement
to
which
it
was
not
a
party.
the
extent
of
the
nonsettling
defendant's
liability
in
that
setting
will
not
be
based
on
its
true
fault
or
culpability.
it
will
instead
be
based
on
an
outside-of-court,
private
deal
made
by
parties
and
the
settling
defendant
was
not
a
party
to
the
agreement.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
well,
your
honor,
the
settling
parties
have
the
incentive,
perhaps,
not
so
much
between
them
to
magnify
the
nonsettling
defendant's
fault.
the
plaintiff
simply
doesn't
care
any
more
what
relationship
that
settlement
bears,
in
that
setting,
to
the
nonsettling
defendant's
actual
fault.
it
gives
the
plaintiff
an
incentive
to
enter
into
a
deal
virtually
with
an
insurance
policy,
and
let
me
premise,
and
let
me
give
the
caveat--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
okay.
it
works
this
way.
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant
decide
to
settle.
they
know
that
the
settlement
bar
rule
controls
and
governs,
the
pro
tanto
settlement
bar
rule.
the
plaintiff
understands
in
that
setting...
and
it
may
hinge
somewhat
on
the
degrees
of
fault
that
are
perceived,
or
resources.
at
any
event,
the
plaintiff
knows
in
that
setting
that
if
i
don't
cut
a
particularly
good
deal
with
this
defendant,
it
doesn't
matter,
because
waiting
in
the
wings
is
a
florida
power
&
light,
for
example,
who
i
need
only
establish
1
percent
blame
upon
to
get
a
total
recovery
against.
they
will--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--yes,
your
honor,
and
let
me--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--and
i
think
i
need
to
restate
my
preface.
as
far
as
florida
power
is
concerned,
we
will
be
happy
with
either
rule.
we
will
accept
either
proportionate
credit
or
the
contribution
approach.
i'm
assuming
that
in
the
event
that
this
court
doesn't
opt
for
the
proportionate
credit
approach,
i'm
trying
to
highlight
the
unfairness
of
the
settlement
bar
rule
in
that
setting,
and
i
think
part
of
the
unfairness
comes
out
of
this
court's
own
cases.
supreme
court
cases
tell
us...
for
example,
in
the
cooper
stevedoring
case,
this
court
disapproves
a
rule
that
permits
a
plaintiff
to
force
the
entire
liability
on
one
of
two
defendants
even
if
that
defendant
is
equally...
that
is,
the
settling
defendant
is
equally
or
more
at
fault.
in
the
reliable
transfer
case,
which
has
been
discussed
at
length,
this
court
talked
about
principles
of
fair
fault
allocation
and
the
fact
that
those
principles
should
take
precedence
over
quick
but
inequitable
settlements.
now,
it's
also
been
discussed
that
the
settlement
bar
rule
perhaps
has
one
advantage
in
the
pro
tanto
setting
over
a
contribution
approach.
the
one
advantage
that
the
proponents
of
the
settlement
bar
rule
claim
is
that
it
is
efficient.
the
argument
runs
as
follows:
it's
efficient
because
it
has
promoted
that
initial
settlement
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
first
settlor,
but
in
practice
the
rule
is
not
efficient,
and
in
practice
the
rule
really
doesn't
encourage
the
sort
of
settlements
that
the
courts
want
to
encourage,
the
sort
of
settlements
that
affect
the
true
judicial
economy.
in
practice,
the
settlement
bar
rule
and
the
pro
tanto
setting
frustrates
complete
settlements,
and
it
will
only
encourage
that
initial
partial
settlement.
the
reason
is
the
reason
i
gave
earlier.
the
settlement
can,
in
effect,
serve
as
a
war
chest
for
the
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
will
be
encouraged
to
litigate
against
the
nonsettling
defendant
because
it
knows
that
whatever
bargain
it
struck
at
the
outset,
the
nonsettling
defendant
will
be
required
to
make
up
the
shortfall,
the
discount.
the
nonsettling
defendant
will
be
required
to
save
it
from
its
own
bad
bargain,
and
what
makes
it
particularly
unfair,
thinking
of
reliable
transfer
and
cooper
stevedoring,
is
that
that
will
be
the
case
even
though
the
settling
defendant
is
far,
far
more
culpable.
of
course,
in
this
case
the
court
required,
we
do
not
yet
know
the
relative
culpabilities
of
florida
power
&
light
vis-a-vis
the
boca
grande
club.
another
efficiency
that
has
been
claimed
on
behalf
of
the
settlement
bar
rule
as
an
advantage
over
contribution
has
to
do
with
ancillary
litigation
and
the
good
faith
hearing
requirement
that
we've
heard
discussed.
it
is
true
that
the
contribution
approach
necessarily
definitionally
involves
a
second
proceeding,
a
contribution
action.
it
is
also
true,
however,
and
the
settlement
bar
rule's
own
proponents
almost
universally
acknowledge
this,
that
if
you're
going
to
administer
the
settlement
bar
rule
in
any
sort
of
meaningful
way,
and
in
any
way
that
would
detect,
perhaps
not
collusion,
that's
been
discussed,
but
certainly
patent
unfairness,
then
the
good
faith
hearing
itself
to
be
efficacious
is
going
to
have
to
be
akin
to
a
minitrial.
it's
going
to
have
to
be
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
merits,
and
it's
going
to
necessarily
entail--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
that
the
cases
have
clearly
told
us
that.
a
number
of
cases
that
have
discussed
good
faith
hearings
have
said
that
if
the
good
faith
hearing
is
to
be
truly
efficacious
and
accomplish
the
result
that's
intended,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
issue
the
court
wants
to
address
there
is
one
that's
akin
to
a
determination
of
proportional
fault.
the
good
faith
of
the
settlement
under
a
number
of
cases
that
adopt
the
settlement
bar
rule,
the
good
faith
of
the
settlement,
will
at
least
in
part
hinge
on
the
comparative
liability
of
the
parties,
which
speaks
to
its
inefficiency.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
the...
that's
the
way
the
cases
read,
as
i
read
them,
your
honor.
they
have
a
more...
even
the
proponents
of
the
settlement
bar
rule
and
the
cases
they
cite,
and
the
cases
in
the
briefs
in
this
particular
case,
envision
a
much
more
probing
inquiry,
not
one
that
just
looks
at
the
settlement
superficially
to
determine
solely
if
there's
collusion
or
not,
but
one
that
really
looks
at
the
merits
of
the
action,
and
it
seems
assumed
in
this
setting
that
that's
necessary.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
my
understanding
of
the
cases
is
that...
and
this
may
or
may
not
sound
like
definitional
collusion.
my
understanding
of
the
cases
is,
wholly
unrelated
to
the
merits
of
the
action,
the
two
parties
just
decide
that
we're
simply
going
to
get
the
deep
pocket,
here's
a
pittance,
don't
worry
about
it,
you're
going
to
be
able
to
sue
the
deep
pocket
for
the
balance,
and
you've
got
a
guarantee
that
you're
going
to
be
able
to
collect
it.
now--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--it
may
not
be
definitionally
collusive,
your
honor,
but
the
same
cases
that
speak
to
the
need
of
a
good
faith
hearing
use
in
tandem
with
the
discussion
of
collusion
the
necessity
to
assure
that
the
proceeding
is
fair.
in
other
words,
to
assure
that
the
settlement
is
fair.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
it
seems
to
me
that
they're
speaking
of
a
global
fairness,
which
is
the
whole
point,
and
which
undercuts
the
efficiency
that's
claimed
by
the
proponents
of
the
settlement
bar
rule.
if
you're
truly
going
to
inquire
as
to
global
fairness,
then
you've
got
a
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
no,
your
honor,
we're...
i
guess
maybe
i
didn't
make
my
position
clear.
we
are
arguing
against
a
pro
rata
rule
that
bars
contribution
suits
even
if
it
has
a
good
faith
hearing.
in
this
instance,
for
example,
boca
grande
club
has
said,
well,
let's
have
no
good
faith
hearing
and
a
settlement
bar.
what
we're
asking
the
court
is
to
determine
the
following:
first,
we
are
equally
satisfied
with
the
proportionate
credit
approach
as
we
are
to
the
contribution
approach.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
that
issue
isn't
even
addressed.
i
don't--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--well,
there's
a
lot
of
confusion
in
the
terminology
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
that's
correct.
there
would
be...
under
the
proportionate
credit
or
proportionate
fault
rule,
or
what
some
courts
and
parties
have
called
the
pro
rata
rule,
they
all
mean
the
same
thing,
the
proportionate
allocation
rule,
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
contribution
action
because
a
nonsettling
defendant
like
florida
power
&
light
is
well
satisfied
that
whatever
the
finder
of
fact
determines
is
the
proportional
fair--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--there's
no
requirement
of
a
good
faith
hearing--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--in
that
setting,
and
perhaps
i
used
the
wrong
terms
earlier,
your
honor.
i
apologize.
i'm
only
speaking
about...
i'm
only
discussing
a
pro
tanto
situation
with
a
settlement
bar,
not
proportionate
credit,
but
what
has
been
called
the
settlement
bar
rule
in
the
briefs
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
for
example,
florida
power
would
be
happy...
and
i
think
this
would
be
the
necessary
result
if
proportionate
fault
is
adopted...
florida
power
would
be...
florida
power
&
light
would
be
well-satisfied
to
have
another
trial
on
liability
and
have
our
proportional
fault
vis-a-vis
boca
grande
determined.
that's
what
would
be
required.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
i--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--it
does,
your
honor,
dispense
with
the
necessity
of
a
good
faith
hearing
for
this
reason.
to
the
extent
there
is
a
patently
unfair
deal,
we
might
call
it
struck
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
settling
defendant,
under
a
proportionate
fault
regime,
the
impact
of
that,
the
burden
of
that,
is
going
to
be
visited
on
the
parties
who
struck
the
deal.
it
will
not
be
visited
on
the
nonsettling
defendant.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
i
agree--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--i
agree
with
that,
and
that--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--yes,
and
that--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
critical
flaw
in
the
settlement
bar
approach
is
that
the
process
of
that
foisting
will
always
be
visited,
the
result
of
that
will
always
be
visited
on
the
nonsettling
defendant,
and
as
compared
to
the
proportionate
credit
approach,
the
parties
can
cut
their
own
deal
and
they
can
live
with
it.
they're
the
parties
to
the
agreement.
in
the
other
situation,
the
settlement
bar
situation
under
the
pro
tanto
approach,
a
nonsettling
defendant
like
florida
power
has
absolutely
no
input
in
that
process,
and
a
jury
verdict
can
come
back
that
can
be
grossly
unfair
to
it--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--grossly
disproportionate
placed
damages
against--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
that,
with
all
due
respect,
is
perhaps
we
have
the
finder
of
fact
and
juries
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to
worry
about...
i
believe
the
court
would
be
describing
a
sort
of
in-court
collusion
that
will
have
to
be
held
up
to
the
light
of
the
trial
process.
under
the
settlement
bar
rule,
there's
no
such
probing
inquiry.
under
the
settlement
bar
rule,
we
have
an
out-of-court
agreement
that
when
struck
initially
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
judicial
process.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
my
belief
is
that
if
they
are
going
to
try
to
collude
in
that
fashion
they're
going
to
have
to
prove
it
up.
none
of
these
rules
operates
perfectly.
it's
our
position,
though,
that
the
proportionate
credit
rule
in
that
aspect
is
far
more
fair.
at
the
very
least,
under
the
proportionate
credit
rule
the
nonsettling
defendant
knows
that
his
liability
will
be
limited
and
the
negligence
of
others
will
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
your
honor,
i
just
don't...
it's
our
position
that
the
good
faith
hearing,
because
of
the
way
the
system
operates
overall,
isn't
a
necessary
appendage.
we
certainly
have
no
objection
to
it.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
wants
to
impose
a
good
faith
requirement--
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
--well,
perhaps,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
that
would
seem
to
be
the
case.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
of
a
jurisdiction
that
has
adopted
a
proportionate
credit
approach
coupled
with
a
good
faith
hearing
requirement,
and
i
think
the
reason
probably
is
the
one
i
began
with,
and
that
is
efficiency.
it
seems,
at
least
comparatively
speaking,
unnecessary
to
impose
that,
and
i
guess
the
thinking
is
the
efficiency,
and
that
is,
the
efficiency
that
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
proportionate
credit
approach
of
all
these
options
is
the
only
one
trial
solution,
that
efficiency
would
be
lost
if
there
were
an
ancillary
appendage
to
it.
mr.
stuart
c.
markman
with
the
preface
that
we're
equally
happy
with
the
proportionate
credit
approach,
i
would
say
no.
i
mean,
i
believe
that
the
settlements
that
are
deterred
by
the
application
of
the
contribution
rule
are
settlements
that
are
not
worth
encouraging
to
begin
with.
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
we're
trying...
the
sort
of
settlements
that
the
settlement
bar
rule
encourages
are
the
partial
settlements
that
don't
yield
the
judicial
efficiency.
they're
the
partial
settlements
that
encourage
a
prolongation
of
litigation
anyway,
and
when
you
throw
into
the
mix
that
you've
got
to
go
back
and
try
to
make
them
somewhat
fair
by
imposing
a
good
faith
requirement
and
having
an
additional
proceeding,
i
don't
think,
on
balance,
we
discourage
settlements.
if
the
deal
struck
is
relatively
fair,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
contribution
action
will
be
discouraged
because
the
party's
going
to
say,
hey,
i
don't
want
to
spend
the
money
on
a
contribution
suit.
that's
pretty
close,
when
you
consider
litigation
costs
and
risks.
under
the
maritime
common
law,
the
supreme
court
is
free
to
select
the
fairest
and
best
solution
to
govern
this
situation.
the
core
maritime
principles
that
have
guided
this
court
teach
that
this
court
should
reject
the
settlement
bar
rule
in
the
pro
tanto
setting,
and
in
the
alternative
adopt
either
the
proportionate
credit
approach
or
the
contribution
approach.
thank
you.
