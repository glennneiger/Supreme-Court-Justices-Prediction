justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
pope,
just
so...
has
there
been
a
determination
in
the
litigation
as
to
the
proportionate
responsibility
of
the
co-defendants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
would
not
be
an
issue
on
remand
as
to
what
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--correct
division
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reason
i
raise
the
question...
the
plaintiff
isn't
here,
as
i
understand
it...
is
not
a
party
to
this
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
conceivably
could
have
an
interest
in
what
the
allocation
could
be
if
boca
grande
is
out
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
help
me,
mr.
pope?
what
do
the
lawyers
mean
when
they
talk
about
a
collusive
settlement
in
this
regard?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's
always
an
agreement
between
two
adversaries.
that's
collusion.
it
has
to
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pope,
i
hate
to...
i'm
getting
an
education
from
you,
so
i
hope
you
don't
mind
one
more
question
about
the
mary
carter--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--formula.
would
florida
hold
the
agreement
unenforceable
if
it
were
not
secret,
if
the
agreement
on
its
face
said,
we're
going
to
pay
x
dollars
and
we
will
agree
to
take
the
position
that
the
other
side
was
primarily...
the
other
defendant
was
primarily
responsible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
secrecy
is
not
an
element.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
can't
agree
that
your
position
in
the
litigation
will
be
x
rather
than
y.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure...
i'm
really
not
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
you're
saying
that
the
settling
parties
will
try
to
magnify
the
percentage
of
responsibility
for
the
nonsettling
defendant,
is
that
the
point?
won't
they
try
to
do
that,
even
if
there's
a
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
really
not
sure
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
go
through
it
slowly
for
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see,
you're
assuming...
your
whole
argument
is
resting
on
the
predicate
that
we
adopt
the
pro
tanto
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
i
understand.
i
didn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
mann,
is
that
type
of
collusion
a
problem
if
we
do
not
adopt
the
pro
tanto
rule?
