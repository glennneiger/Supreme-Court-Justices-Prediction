mr.
david
f.
pope
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
previous
case
considered
the
relationships
in
a
maritime
tort
system
between
the
claimants
and
the
nonsettling
tortfeasors.
in
this
case,
we're
going
to
consider
the
relationship
in
a
maritime
tort
system
between
the
settling
tortfeasor
and
the
nonsettling
tortfeasors.
this
proceeding
arises
from
a
limitation
of
liability
case
filed
as
a
result
of
an
accident
which
occurred
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
accident
was
a
collision
between
a
sailboat
and
an
electric
power
line
in
a
place
called
gasparilla
pass
on
the
west
coast
of
florida.
boca
grande
club
was
the
owner
of
the
sailboat.
florida
power
&
light
company
was
the
owner
of
the
power
line.
the
sailboat
had
been
rented
to
dr.
robert
polackwich,
who
was
a
member
of
the
club,
and
his
stepson,
jonathan
richards.
both
dr.
polackwich
and
mr.
richards
died
from
electrocution
as
a
result
of
the
collision.
boca
grande
club
started
this
limitation
case,
and
claims
were
filed
in
the
action
by
the
polackwich
and
richards
personal
representatives,
relatives
of
the
deceased,
florida
power
&
light
company,
and
o'day
corporation,
the
sailboat's
manufacturer.
boca
grande
club
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
with
the
district
court
as
to
all
claims,
based
on
the
contention
that
the
collision
was
solely
caused
by
the
fact
that
florida
power
&
light
company
did
not
erect
and
maintain
the
power
line
at
the
minimum
height
above
the
navigable
waters
as
required
by
the
army
corps
of
engineers
permit.
mr.
david
f.
pope
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
the
choice
between
a
proportionate
credit
rule
and
a
pro
tanto
or
dollar-for-dollar
deduction
rule
would,
if
the
court
selects
a
proportional
credit
rule,
basically
eliminate
any
claim
for
contribution
as
an
operation
of
law.
the
claim
would
not
arise.
the
district
court
in
this
case
granted
boca
grande
club
summary
judgment
as
to
the
contribution
claims
of
florida
power
&
light
company
following
settlement
with
the
polackwich
and
richards
claimants.
the
basis
of
the
summary
judgment
granted
by
the
district
court
was
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
self
v.
great
lakes,
which
had
recognized
the
settlement
bar
rule
with
respect
to
contribution
claims.
the
eleventh
circuit
decided
a
subsequent
case,
styled
great
lakes
v.
tanker,
before
the
time
to
appeal
the
summary
judgment
had
expired.
boca
grande...
excuse
me.
the
great
lakes
case
held
that
the
settlement
bar
rule
announced
in
self
was
dicta,
and
said
that
both
settling
and
nonsettling
tortfeasors
could
sue
for
contribution.
the
great
lakes
tanker
case
does
not
place
a
limitation
as
to
whether
the
party
bringing
the
contribution
claim
is
one
who
himself
has
settled,
or
one
who
is
seeking
contribution
from
a
party
who
already
settled.
florida
power
&
light
company
appealed
the
summary
judgment,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed
on
the
basis
of
its
decision
in
great
lakes.
the
relief
boca
grande
club
seeks
is
reversal
of
the
ruling
by
the
eleventh
circuit
and
establishment
of
a
rule
in
this
case
that
will
allow
it
to
be
protected
from
contribution
claims.
this
relief
can
be
accomplished
regardless
of
which
settlement
credit
the
court
may
adopt
as
a
result
of
the
mcdermott
case.
mr.
david
f.
pope
there
has
been
a...
your
honor,
there
has
been
no
determination
of
boca
grande
club's
contributory
fault
for
the
collision.
your
question
will
require
me
to
go
outside
the
record
to
state
that
in
the
state
court
trial
between
the
polackwich
claimants
and
florida
power
&
light
company,
there
was
a
determination
of
proportionate
fault
between
those
parties
and
the
allocation
of
fault
was
65
percent
for
florida
power
&
light
and
35
percent
for
the
polackwich-richards
claimants.
mr.
david
f.
pope
no,
sir.
mr.
david
f.
pope
no,
sir,
at
least
not
as
the
case
presently
stands.
i
should
point
out--
mr.
david
f.
pope
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
pope
yes,
sir,
and
i
would
also
believe
that
the
claimants
would
have
a
great
interest
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
mcdermott
case,
since
the
verdict
and
judgments
in
the
state
court
of
florida
are
on
appeal
at
the
present
time.
mr.
david
f.
pope
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
would
be
correct,
because
the
cause
of
action
upon
which
florida
power
&
light
company
sues...
namely,
the
contribution
claim...
would
cease
to
exist
as
a
matter
of
law,
because
it
could
not
be
paying
more
than
its
proportionate
share
of
the
fault,
period,
so
there
would
be
no...
the
contribution
as
a
theoretical
right
would
exist,
but
not
for
them.
as
justice
o'connor
has
indicated,
under
the
proportionate
credit,
or
sometimes
it's
been
called
the
pro
rata
rule,
the
nonsettling
tortfeasor
receives
a
credit
for
the
settling
tortfeasor's
concurrent
fault.
the
nonsettling
tortfeasor
is
held
responsible
only
for
its
own
fault.
no
claim
for
contribution
exists,
since
the
nonsettling
tortfeasor
is
not
being
held
liable
for
anyone's
fault
but
its
own.
we
would
suggest,
however,
that
even
under
a
proportionate
credit
or
pro
rata
rule,
a
settlement
bar
would
still
be
necessary
because
of
the
ruling
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
great
lakes
v.
tanker,
which
permitted
settling
tortfeasors
to
seek
contribution.
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
could
be
a
complete
settlement
between
all
of
the
parties,
and
nonetheless
one
of
the
settling
parties
believing
it
had
paid
too
much,
institute
contribution
actions
against
others.
mr.
david
f.
pope
i'm
sorry--
mr.
david
f.
pope
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
david
f.
pope
yes,
ma'am,
that's
correct.
the
eleventh
circuit's
position
was
to
adopt
a
pro
tanto,
or
dollar-for-dollar
deduction,
and
allow
full
contribution
as
a
means
by
a
two-step
or
more
procedure
to
achieve
what
is
in
effect
the
proportionate
credit
rule.
mr.
david
f.
pope
that's
correct.
mr.
david
f.
pope
the
suggestion
was
that
the
edmonds
result
dictated
that
with
respect
to
the
seamen,
who
were
the
personal
injury
claimants
in
the
great
lakes
scenario,
which
is...
it
starts
with
ebanks,
it
goes
to
self,
and
then
it
goes
to
great
lakes
v.
tanker,
that
edmonds...
the
decision
of
this
court
in
edmonds,
recognizing
joint
and
several
liability,
placed
one
of
the
defendants,
the
great
lakes
defendant
in
that
case,
in
a
situation
where
it,
as
a
30-percent-responsible-for-the-collision
party,
would
end
up
paying
100
percent
of
the
damages,
whereas
the
70-percent-at-fault
party,
the
chevron
vessel,
which
had
already
made
a
settlement
with
all
of
the
personal
injury
claimants,
would
not
be
responding
unless
contribution
were
allowed.
mr.
david
f.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
f.
pope
no,
sir.
mr.
david
f.
pope
the
state
action
was...
the
settlement
between
boca
grande
club
and
the
polackwich-richards
claimants
occurred
in...
i
believe
it
was
september-october
of
1990.
the
case
between
polackwich-richards
claimants
and
florida
power
&
light
took
place
in
the
state
courts
of
florida,
i
believe
it
was
in
february-march
of
1993,
and
is
currently
on
appeal.
we
would
suggest
that
even
under
the
pro
tanto
or
dollar-for-dollar
credit,
this
court
can
nonetheless
find
that
a
settlement
bar
rule
should
be
effective.
under
a
pro
tanto
credit,
the
nonsettling
tortfeasor
receives
a
credit
against
the
claimants'
damages
equal
to
that
paid
by
the
settling
tortfeasor.
under
a
pro
tanto
credit,
unlike
the
proportional
fault
rule,
a
settlement
bar...
an
explicit
settlement
bar
is
required,
because
it
is
possible,
as
we
have
heard
in
the
prior
argument,
that
the
dollar
amount
of
the
settlement
will
not
equal
the
settling
tortfeasor's
proportional
fault
for
the
casualty.
it
could
be
higher,
it
could
be
lower,
he
made
a
good
bargain,
he
may
not
have
made
a
good
bargain.
it
is
still
possible,
under
a
pro
tanto
regime,
that
all
parties
will
settle.
in
fact,
that's
what
happened
in
the
great
lakes
case.
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
a
pro
tanto
or
dollar-for-dollar
deduction
which...
we
invite
the
court
to
examine
all
three
opinions...
has
never
taken
place
yet
in
that
case.
the
amount
paid
by
chevron
has
never
been
accounted
for
to
this
day
in
that
case,
but
nonetheless
there
was
a
pro
tanto
deduction
where
the
right
of
contribution
came
up.
mr.
david
f.
pope
i'm
sorry,
because
what
happened
in
the
great
lakes
case
was
that
chevron
early
on
settled
with
all
of
the
personal
injury
claimants
who
were
crew
members
of
the
other
vessel.
great
lakes,
the
owner
of
the
other
vessel
and
employer
of
the
crewmen,
did
not
settle
with
its
employees
because
the
employees
had
claims
under
the
jones
act
and
for
unseaworthiness
that
they
did
not
have
against
chevron
as
the
owner
of
the
other
vessel.
in
point
of
fact,
throughout
the
case,
chevron
settled
early
on,
great
lakes
settled
with
self,
the
last
remaining
claimant,
after
the
second
appeal
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
so
in
fact
all
the
claims
were
settled,
none
of
them
were
ever
tried,
and
the
district
court
in
the
great
lakes
remand
is
now
faced
with
the
unhappy
prospect
of
trying
eleven
separate
personal
injury
actions
between
two
settling
defendants
on
damages
for
people
that
10
years
ago
left
the
lawsuit.
in
fact,
the
district
court
entered
an
order
on
december
22nd
in
that
case
scheduling
the
case
for
trial
the
weeks...
during
the
trial
term
beginning
in
april
of
1994.
the
uniform
contribution
among
tortfeasors
act
and
the
restatement
of
torts,
second,
in
886a
recognized
this
type
of
credit,
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
restatement
lists
all
the
credits
that
are
possible,
a
proportionate,
a
pro
tanto
credit,
and
a
settlement
bar
with
a
good
faith
hearing
requirement.
we
would
submit
that
any
good
faith
hearing
requirement
under
a
pro
tanto
credit
regime,
which
goes
beyond
satisfying
the
court
that
the
agreement
between
the
settling
parties
is
noncollusive,
would
have
an
extremely
adverse
effect
on
settlements.
in
effect,
there
would
be
a
minitrial,
trying
to
equate
the
settling
parties'
fault
or
proportional
fault
and
damages
in
advance
of
the
main
trial,
which
would
necessarily
involve
factual
issues,
and
therefore
probably
would
be
subject
to
appeal,
and
the
benefit
derived
to
the
settling
tortfeasor
of
being
able
to
close
his
books
on
this
matter
would
be
lost.
there
would
probably
be
an
appeal,
and
the
matter
might
be
kept
alive
for
a
great
amount
of
time.
mr.
david
f.
pope
your
honor,
i
believe...
and
i
will
advert
to
a
decision,
the
recent
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
because
i
heard
the
word
mary
carter
agreement
in
an
earlier
argument,
and
there
is
a
decision
that
was
just
announced
in
the
florida
supreme
court
along
with
several
other
decisions
that
had
to
do
with
florida's
adoption
of
a
comparative
fault
regime
which
outlawed
mary
carter
agreements.
and
basically
the
thrust
of
that
opinion,
which
is
called
dasdorian...
i
can't
remember
the
second
name
of
the
party,
but
the
dasdorian
case
said
that
henceforth
in
florida
we're
not
going
to
allow
cases
to
go
forward
where
as
part
of
the
settlement
agreement
the
settling
defendant
either
agrees
to
participate
in
the
trial
and
lay
off
blame,
or
help
the
plaintiff
lay
off
blame
on
the
nonsettling
defendants,
or
agrees
to
assist
or
aid
the
claimant
in
some
way
that
is
improper.
mr.
david
f.
pope
yes,
sir.
a
mary
carter
agreement
is
an
agreement
whereby,
at
least
as
i
understand
it
in
florida,
whereby
a
defendant
secretly
settles
with
the
plaintiff
but
nonetheless
agrees
to
participate
in
the
trial
and
assist
the
plaintiff
in
the
prosecution
of
the
claim
against
the
nonsettling
defendant,
and
the
florida
courts
have
outlawed
that.
the...
i
would
like
to
note
that
the
agreement
that
was
described
to
you
earlier
in
the
prior
argument
is
what
i
would
call
in
florida
a
high-low
agreement.
that
is,
an
agreement
whereby
a
defendant
agrees
to
settle,
and
if
you
recover
x
dollars
from
the
nonsettling
defendant,
i'll
pay
you
this,
but
if
you
don't
get
that
much,
i'll
pay
you
x
plus
something
else,
and
that's
called
a
high-low
agreement,
and
the
florida
said
that
kind
of
agreement's
okay,
as
long
as
you
don't
procure
assistance
to
subvert
the
trial
process.
in
other
words,
what
they
try
to
do
is
protect
the
nonsettling
defendant's
day
in
court,
as
i
understand.
if
a
pro
tanto
credit
with
full
contribution,
which
is
the
eleventh
circuit
rule,
is
adopted,
any
settlements
in
a
multiparty
maritime
tort
case
will
be
extremely
unlikely.
i
say
this
for
the
following
reasons.
the
settling
tortfeasor
is
subject
to
the
results
of
the
trial
he
does
not
participate
in.
in
the
instant
case,
this
very
matter,
the
polackwich
and
richards
claim
trial,
went
to
trial
in
the
state
court,
which
resulted
in
an
$8.7
million
verdict.
mr.
david
f.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
f.
pope
as
i
understand
it,
that
would
be
an
illegal
agreement
in
florida
whether
it--
mr.
david
f.
pope
--secrecy
has
nothing--
mr.
david
f.
pope
--correct,
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
agreement
is
secret
or
not
secret,
the
interest
the
court
was
trying
to
protect
is
the
integrity
of
the
ongoing
trial
process,
and
parties
can
settle...
great...
but
apparently
in
florida
it
was
becoming
more
of
a
problem
than
maybe
it
should
have
been.
we
would
go
back
to
the
eleventh
circuit
rule
and
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
settling
tortfeasor
who
is
subject
to
the
results
of
the
trial
and
does
not
participate
in
it
would
probably
be
disinclined
most...
extremely
disinclined
to
enter
into
any
settlement
agreement
with
the
plaintiff.
an
additional
disadvantage
to
the
settling
tortfeasor
is
that
he
cannot
close
his
books
on
this
casualty.
he
has
to
keep
this
matter
open
until
the
claim
is
ultimately
resolved
against
the
settling
tortfeasor,
and
if
there
is
contribution,
that's
resolved.
in
this
very
case,
we
may
be
looking
at
procedures
3,
4,
and
5
years
in
the
future
if
the
eleventh
circuit's
ruling
is
upheld,
given
the
state
court
appeals,
the
possibility
of
a
retrial
in
the
state
court,
and
then
perhaps
a
contribution
action
at
some
later
date
against
boca
grande
club
who,
as
a
limitation
plaintiff,
the
only
place
that
court...
that
case
could
be
heard
would
be
in
the
u.s.
district
court
in
tampa,
so
we
have
that
situation.
i
heard
it
mentioned
in
the
earlier
argument
that
a
full
contribution
or
nonsettlement
bar
probably
would
penalize
a
claimant,
too,
because
a
cautious
settling
defendant
would
probably
insert
into
the
settlement
agreement
an
indemnity
provision
or
maybe
escrow
some
of
the
funds,
i
don't
know
quite
how...
there's
many
ways
it
could
be
accomplished,
but
which
would
protect
the
possibility
if
contribution...
there
were
no
settlement
bar,
that
the
settling
defendant
might
have
to
pay
back
some
money
at
some
time
in
the
future.
every
maritime
court,
other
than
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
has
considered
the
settlement
bar
issue,
has
opted
for
a
rule
that
terminates
the
contribution
claim
either
by
a
proportionate
credit
or
by
a
pro
tanto
rule
with
a
settlement
bar.
the
cases
other
than
this
case
that
have
adopted
pro
tanto
and
settlement
bar
have
all
opted
for
a
good
faith
hearing.
this
court...
excuse
me,
those
courts
that
recognize
a
settlement
bar
rule
are
recognizing
a
corollary
principle
of
conservation
of
judicial
resources
and
encouraging
settlement.
we
believe
that
these
policies
are
worthy
of
consideration
in
this
case.
boca
grand
club
does
not
believe
that
any
decisions
of
this
court
prohibit
adoption
of
a
settlement
bar
rule.
the
rules
established
in
reliable
transfer
for
comparative
fault
in
cooper
for
contribution
and
edmonds
for
joint
and
several
liability
can
still
all
operate
as
between
the
nonsettling
parties.
nothing
in
those
cases
would
prohibit
a
settlement
bar
rule.
none
of
them
dealt
with
the
situation
of
a
settling
tortfeasor
and
a
nonsettling
tortfeasor.
boca
grande
club
notes
that
in
the
recent
decision
of
musick,
peeler,
this
court
recognized
its
authority
to
provide
a
just
and
equitable
remedy
for
cases
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
we
would
submit
that
recognition
of
a
settlement
bar
rule
is
further
recognition
of
a
just
and
equitable
resolution
of
this
maritime
tort
problem.
the
arguments
advanced
against
a
settlement
bar
rule
by
florida
power
&
light
in
the
united
states
are
flawed
because
the
basic
assumption
of
those
arguments
is
incorrect.
i
believe
in
the
earlier
argument
we
alluded
to
this
a
little
bit,
but
the
basic
assumption
of
florida
power
&
light
in
the
united
states
is
that
the
primarily
liable
tortfeasor
who
is
the
deep
pocket,
as
that
term
is
used,
will
be
called
to
go
to
trial,
while
the...
excuse
me,
i
misspoke
myself.
the
primarily
liable
but
impecunious
defendant
who
settles
will
transfer
his
liability
to
the
less
liable
but
deep
pocket
defendant.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff
will
proceed
to
trial
against
the
party
that
can
best
pay
the
judgment,
rather
than
the
party
that
has
the
greatest
culpability.
this
is
really
not
an
objection
to
a
settlement
bar
rule.
this
is
really
an
objection
to
this
court's
ruling
in
edmonds
on
joint
and
several
liability.
what
they're
complaining
about...
no
one
can
complain,
the
united
states,
not
florida
power
&
light...
if
the
ultimate
determination
is
that
they
were
65
percent
at
fault
for
the
casualty,
and
they
pay
65
percent
of
the
damages,
nobody's
got
a
complaint
coming.
so
nobody
can
argue
with
proportionate
fault.
what
they're
arguing
about
is,
we're
paying...
like
they
did
in
great
lakes...
100
percent
of
the
damages
and
we're
30
percent
at
fault.
mr.
david
f.
pope
i
agree,
i
think
the
plaintiff
would
argue
against,
because
it
would
want
the
benefits
of
joint
and
several
liability,
but
we
are
not
here
in
this
case
to
question
the
applicability
of
joint
and
several
liability
as
to
the
parties
that
go
forward
with
the
litigation.
we
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
plaintiff
among
the
nonsettling
defendants
can't
collect
all
of
its
judgment
from
one
of
those
defendants
and
then
they
settle
among
themselves
on
contribution,
since
they
didn't
settle
their
respective
proportionate
degrees
of
fault,
so
we
think
the
rules
still
operate,
but
they
should
operate
only
as
to
the
nonsettling
parties.
we
would
also
point
out
that
if
a
settling
tortfeasor
really
has
limited
assets,
all
the
discussion
about
contribution
is
somewhat
meaningless,
since
the
contribution
claim
is
going
to
be
basically
worthless
either.
if
he
wasn't
interested
in
defending
his
position
and
trying
to
get
out
cheaply
on
the
initial
claim,
i
doubt
seriously
any
contribution
claim
would
cause
any
great
concern.
a
final
matter
on
the
arguments
of
florida
power
&
light
and
the
united
states,
they
suggest
that
if
a
tortfeasor
is
truly
the
most
culpable
and
will
settle,
that
the
claimant
will
go
along
with
that.
it
has
been
my
experience
that
the
claimant,
the
plaintiff
in
an
action,
avoids
if
at
all
possible
an
empty
chair.
it
is
stretching
the
imagination
to
suggest
that
the
empty
chair
the
plaintiff
will
accept
for
a
minimum
settlement
is
the
most
culpable
defendant.
in
other
words,
he
will
go
to
trial
against
a
deep
pocket
who
is
not
really
culpable
and
let
out
the
very
party
who
is
the
most
culpable.
if
nothing
else,
the
defendant,
given
the
fact
of
joint
and...
excuse
me.
the
plaintiff,
given
the
fact
of
joint
and
several
liability,
would
continue
and
keep
in
the
less
culpable
but
impecunious
defendant
because
he
can
recover
it
all
if
he
proves
fault...
any
fault
on
the
other
party.
he
wouldn't
settle
with
anybody.
he
wants
that
chair
filled.
he
wants
that
party
defending
his
position,
and
he
doesn't
want
to
be
the
person
standing
up
in
front
of
the
judge
or
the
jury
defending
somebody
that
is
the
most
culpable
for
the
very
accident
for
which
he
claims
relief.
boca
grande
club
submits
that
the
better
rule
among
the
proportionate
credit
and
the
pro
tanto
rule
is
the
proportionate
credit
rule,
although
we
recognize
that
that
really
is
a
decision
for
the
prior
case.
the
proportionate
credit
best
accommodates
the
competing
interests
of
the
parties
in
a
multiparty
maritime
tort.
the
claimant
can
settle
part
of
his
claim.
the
settling
tortfeasor
can
close
his
file,
and
his
liability
is
extinguished.
the
nonsettling
tortfeasor
receives
a
credit
for
the
settling
tortfeasor's
proportionate
fault.
he
certainly
can't
complain
about
being
held
liable
for
what
he
did.
in
addition,
the
remaining
liabilities
among
the
nonsettling
parties
can
be
resolved
in
accordance
with
the
prior
rulings
of
this
court
in
edmonds,
cooper,
and
reliable.
the
claimant
still
has
these
benefits
of
joint
and
several
liability
against
the
nonsettling
tortfeasors.
boca
grande
club
requests
that
this
court
reverse
the
order
of
the
eleventh
circuit
and
adopt
a
settlement
bar
rule
either
under
a
proportionate
credit
or
a
pro
tanto
credit
system
with
a
settlement
bar.
thank
you.
mr.
david
f.
pope
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
go
back
over
one
thing
mentioned
by
florida
power
&
light
company
in
its
presentation,
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
review
of
the
documents
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
with
respect
to
the
settlement
reached
between
boca
grande
club
and
the
polackwich
and
richards
claimants
will
contain
representations
that
in
fact
the
settlements
were
made
for
noncollusive
purposes
and
were
made
in
good
faith.
we
would
also
note
that
this
court
has
recently
approved
changes
to
rule
11
that
in
the
federal
procedure,
since
we
and
the
claimants
in
that
case
submitted
documents
to
the
court
signed
by
counsel
which
represented
that
they
were
being
submitted
to
the
court
for
appropriate
purposes,
would
probably...
could
probably
lead
to
sanctions
if
in
fact
it
later
turned
out
that
the
claimants
had
procured
the
cooperation
unduly
of
boca
grande
club
or
its
employees,
and
that
wasn't
disclosed
in
the
settlement
papers
submitted
to
the
court.
we
would
also
submit
that
there
has
been
some
discussion
about
collusive
situations,
and
i
think
the
court
needs
to
distinguish
between
collusive
situations
which
is
what
we've
talked
about,
whereby
as
part
of
the
settlement
agreement
the
settling
party
agrees
to
cooperate
with,
however
that
may
be,
in
presenting
the
case
against
the
nonsettling
party
and
enhancing
or
assisting
the
plaintiff
outside
of
the
normal
court
processes,
and
the
normal
trial
practice
of
the
empty
chair.
it
is
an
anathema
to
plaintiff's
counsel
to
have
an
empty
chair,
and
it
is
the
ideal
situation
for
the
defense
counsel
to
have
somebody
to
point
to
who
isn't
in
court
that
can
be
suggested
as
the
more
culpable
party.
we
would
suggest
that
any
requirement
for
a
good
faith
hearing
be
limited
to...
under
a
pro
tanto
situation
to
an
examination
to
determine
the
collusive
effects,
and
even
in
the
federal
court
system
we
would
suggest
that
the
rule
11
would
pose
severe
concerns
to
a
counsel
who
participated
in
a
collusive
agreement
and
then
obtained
a
dismissal
from
a
u.s.
district
court
based
on
some
pleadings
submitted
to
that
court
that
it
turned
out
resulted
in
a
collusive
effect
at
the
trial
which
later
took
place,
and
i
would
submit
that
certainly
the
nonsettling
defendant
would
be
well
aware
of
what
happened
later
at
the
trial.
if
there
are
no
questions,
that
completes
our
presentation.
