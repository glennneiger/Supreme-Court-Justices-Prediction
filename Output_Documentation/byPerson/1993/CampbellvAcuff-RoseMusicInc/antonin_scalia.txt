mr.
rogow,
could
you
explain
to
me
why...
why
criticism
either
of
the
original
song
or,
as
your
position
states,
of
almost
anything
using
the
original
song,
is
to
be
encouraged
more
than,
let's
say,
patriotism?
why
shouldn't
be
i
be
able
to
use
any
song
that
anyone's
ever
written
in
order
to
set
patriotic
lyrics
to
it?
isn't
that
something
that's
to
be
encouraged?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
one
can
criticize
other
things
without
borrowing
the
music
from
a
tune.
unless
you're
willing
to
limit
your
proposition
as
much
as
justice
o'connor
just
suggested,
your
argument
doesn't
hold.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
are...
but
let's
assume
the
more
general
proposition
that
you
were
trying
to
establish.
what's
your
answer
to
my
question
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
encourage...
you
can
criticize
society
in
many
ways.
you're
quite
right.
you
can...
you
can...
you
can
make
fun
of
this
particular
tune
only
by
using
the
particular
tune.
but
you
can
make
fun
of
society.
you
can
criticize
society
in
a
lot
of
different
ways;
why
do
you
have
to
take
my
tune
to
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
tune
is
very
effective.
you
like
my
tune.
it's
catchy.
people
remember
it.
but
a
lot
of
people
would
want
to
use
it
for
that
reason,
probably.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
patriotism
useful?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
ever
said
that
that's
not
just
the
single
most
important
factor,
but
the
absolutely
determinative
factor?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
how
can
you...
then
how
can
you
assert
that...
that
the
summary
judgment
question
was
automatically
determined
if
there
was
not
enough
evidence
on
that
one
factor?
if
that's
just
one
of
many
factors,
i
don't
see
how...
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
determined.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
but
you
acknowledge
that
the
mere
fact
that
no
information
was
in
the
record
concerning
impairment
of
the
potential
market,
that
alone
is
not
determinative
of
the
issue
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rogow,
my
problem
is
this;
i
don't
see
how
your...
one
is
entitled
to
summary
judgment
if
the
legal
issue
in
the
case
is
to
be
decided
by
a
six
factor
test,
if
the
other
party
happens
to
have
produced
no
evidence
on
one
of
the
six
factors?
i
mean,
so
long
as
you've
produced
some
evidence
on
some
of
the
factors,
isn't
it...
isn't
it
at
least
a
matter
that
should
then
proceed
to
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
rosdeitcher,
i
assume
you
would
have
given
a
license
if
they
had
offered
you
enough
money
for
it.
[laughter]
i
don't
consider
that
a
market
failure.
they
just
weren't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--willing
to
pay
you
enough
to
induce
you
to
give
over
the
song
to
that
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
we're
talking
money
here,
and
they
didn't
give
you
what
you
thought
was
enough
to
make
that
worthwhile,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
just
changing
the
words
would...
would
destroy
it,
whether
you
changed
it
to
make
it
a
parody
or
not.
that
alone
would
deny
the
compulsory
license,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
mr.
rosdeitcher
is
right
that
the
reason
people
bought
this
record
and
the
reason
the
record
was
sold
to
them
was
largely
for
the
music
and
not
for
the...
for
the
subtle
parody.
then...
then
they
have
suffered
a
loss.
that
money
should
have
been
their
money
rather
than
your
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
making
money
from
their
music,
if
he's
right
about
that...
about
that
premise.
