justice
david
h.
souter
but
just
the
market--
--i
think
you're
making
the
same
point.
go
ahead.
shouldn't
the
market
be
defined
more
broadly
as
the
market
for
the
original
song
in
the...
in
the
fashion
in
which
the
original
song
was
sung.
i
mean,
there
could
be...
there
could
be,
you
know,
rock
adaptions
of
waltzes
and
so
on,
and
shouldn't
the
market
be
defined
broadly
enough
to
include
all
the
possible
adaptations
that
the
copyright
owner
might
want
to...
to
make
or
to
license?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
interrupt
you
though
before
you
get
to
the
four
factors?
are
you
saying
that
the...
that
the
district
court
could
not
have
made
any
findings
because
of
the
total
absence
of
evidence
on
the
effect
on
the
broader
market
which
i
described?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
that's
right,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
was
nothing
in
the
affidavits
on
which
that
could
have
been
based.
justice
david
h.
souter
material
fact.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
rogow,
i'm...
there's
something
i
may
not
understand.
if
fair
use
is
an
affirmative
defense,
why
wasn't
the
obligation
on
your
client
in
the
summary
judgment
motion
to
plead
that
there
was
no
market
for
derivative
works
to
be
exploited?
so
that
if
the
record
is
bare
on
that,
you
lose
or
you
should
have
lost
your
summary
judgment
to
the
extent
that
that
would
influence
the
court's
determination.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
market
to
which
you...
you
referred,
i
take
it,
in
your
affidavits,
was
simply
the
market
for
the
original
song
in
the...
in
the
fashion,
the
genre
in
which
it
was
originally
recorded,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
didn't
address
the
question
of
a
market
for
derivative
works
at
all,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
not
have
created
a
genuine
issue,
but
it
still,
on
the
ultimate
legal
question,
left
a
relevant
point
black,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
they
simply
have
to
show
that
there
was
someone
to
whom
they
could
license
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they
don't
have
to
have
a
license
holder
nearby.
you're
talking
about
market,
not
a
particular
market
participant.
