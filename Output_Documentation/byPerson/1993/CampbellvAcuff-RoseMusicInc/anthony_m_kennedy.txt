how
do
you
define
parody?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
has
to
poke
fun
at
the
original
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
any
time
someone
takes
a
melodic
line
and
substitutes
new
lyrics,
that
is
permitted
so
long
as
it
is
making
fun
of
something
else
in
society.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
does
this
mean
that
parody
cannot
be
too
successful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
underlying
theory
of
your
case
that
if
there
is
a
market
to
be
exploited,
in
this
case
280,000
copies,
and
it
can
be
exploited
best
through
a
parody,
that
it
is
essentially
fair
that
the
person
who
creates
the
parody
receives
100
percent
of
the
profit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
nothing
in
the
record
shows
you
knew
that
they
were
going
to
sell
248,000
copies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
example,
i
think
it
was
aerosmith
progressed
or
regressed
to
rap.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
under
the
definition
of
parody
that's
been
submitted
to
us,
would
you
not
expect
that
it
could
be
argued
that
that
was
a
parody?
