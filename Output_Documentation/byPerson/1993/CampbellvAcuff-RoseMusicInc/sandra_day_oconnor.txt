justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
rogow,
that's
a
little
broader
than
it
needs
to
be,
isn't
it,
for
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we
have
a
situation
here
where
it's
making
fun
of
the
original?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
would
have
thought
that
maybe
harper
&
row,
the
case
we
had
here
a
few
years
ago,
refused
to
recognize
a
fair
use
exception
even
for
political
commentary.
so
i
think
your
position
that
a
parody,
if
it's
directed
at
something
other
than
the
original
work,
should
have
some
kind
of
all-encompassing
provision
as
being
a
fair
use.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean
that's...
that's
a
pretty
big
step
to
take.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
your
position
that
a
parody
should
be
found
to
be
a
fair
use
when
it...
when
the
lyrics
poke
fun
at
the
original,
but
the
music
is
the
same?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there's
language
in
our
cases
that
say
exactly
that.
is
it
your
position
that
the
commercial
nature
of
the
use
is
a
factor
to
be
considered,
but
it
isn't...
even
if
it
is
found
to
be
for
a
commercial
purpose,
that
that
isn't
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
is
the
market
that
we
should
look
at.
is
it
the
market
for
parodies,
or
is
it
the
market...
do
we
look
at
whether
it
would
supplant,
somehow,
the
demand
for
the
original
work?
what
is
it
we
look
at?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
were
the
findings
of
the
district
court
as
to
that
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did--
--and
did
the
sixth
circuit
find
that
that
was
erroneous?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
do
have...
we
do
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
on
that
there
was
a
parody.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
dispute
that.
but
i
think
as
it
comes
to
us,
we're
not
getting
into
that.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
just
let's
stop
a
moment
and
inquire.
suppose
you
had
somebody
who...
who
simply
writes
critical
commentary...
very
straightforward,
not
a
parody...
about
somebody
else's
work
and
he
wants
to
sell
his
critical
piece.
can
it
be
a
fair
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
perfectly
commercial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
have
to
rely,
in
part,
on
what
was
said
in
the
original
that
he's...
he's
criticizing
and
writing
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
market
might
be
quite
different
for
the
critical
work.
it
might
be
a
separate
market,
in
a
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
sounds
like...
that
sounds
like
an
argument
that
it
shouldn't
have
been
held
to
be
a
parody
because
too
much
was
taken,
and
i
thought
we
had
gotten
over
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
had
accepted
the
fact
that
this
was
a
parody.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
isn't...
why
isn't
a
parody
of
the
whole
thing
more
persuasive
than
just
a
few
phrases?
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
have
parody
as
a
fair
use
at
all,
it
seems
to
me
you
might
be
much
more
effective
using
the
whole
thing
than
just
a
phrase.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
counsel,
do
we
look
to
the
market
for
the
original
work
and
whether
that's
supplanted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
that
that's
what
we
look
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
all
its
derivatives.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
look
at
the
market
for
parodies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
the
district
court,
it
seems
to
me,
found
that
the
2
live
crew
version
was
a
parody
and
that
acuff-rose
could
still
market
a
rap
version,
that
it
wasn't
affecting
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
a
commercial
use
can
ever
be
a
fair
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
think
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
give
enough
room
at
the
joints,
so
to
speak,
for
dealing
with
the
commercial
nature
so
that
it's
a
factor,
but
it
isn't
the
be
all
and
end
all,
you
still
have
to
weigh
it,
what
should
we
do
here,
send
it
back?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
we
could
also
say
they
were...
they
fell
off
on
putting
total
stress
on
the
commercial
use
and
we
think
they
ought
to
take
another
look.
