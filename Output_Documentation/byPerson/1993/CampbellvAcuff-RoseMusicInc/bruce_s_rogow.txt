mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
the
statute
of
anne
in
1709
through
the
copyright
clause
of
our
constitution,
through
the
copyright
statute
and
until
today,
the
purpose
of
copyright
has
been
to
encourage
creativity.
parody
is
a
creative
force
in
our
society
and
has
historically
been
a
creative
force,
and
parody
should
be
encouraged.
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
discouraged
parody,
and
we
ask
the
court
today
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit.
the
rule
that
we
suggest
is
that
parody
is
a
fair
use
unless
it
materially
impairs
the
market
for
the
original,
and
material
impairment
of
the
market
for
the
original
means
supplant
the
original.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
a
parody
imitates
and
ridicules.
it
pokes
fun
at
the
original.
and
there
are
many
definitions
of
parody--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--not
necessarily.
it
can
poke
fun
at
the
original,
or
it
can
poke
fun
at
something
else
using
the
original
work.
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
criticism.
one
would
be
criticism
of
the
original
work,
the
other
would
be
criticism
of
society
using
the
original
work
as
a
means
of
conveying
that
criticism.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
as
long
as...
yes,
justice
kennedy,
as
long
as
it
is
making
fun
of
something
else
in
society
or
the
original,
because
that
is
the
purpose
of
parody.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
for
this
case--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--we
do,
justice
o'connor.
and
for
this
case--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--justice--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--justice
o'connor,
for
this
case
it
is
true
that
the
parody
in
this
case
only
poked
fun
at
the
original.
and
one
could
limit
this
case
to
just
those
facts
and
that
would
be
quite
fine.
harper
&
row
is
actually
quite
helpful
to
us,
because
harper
&
row...
it
is
true,
it
was
the
nation,
a
news
magazine,
but
it
materially
impaired
the
market
for
the
harper
&
row
publication.
and
i
think
that's
the
other
important
factor
here,
impairment
of
the
market.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
one...
yes.
one
needs
to
use
the
music
from
the
original
in
order
to
evoke
the
image
of
the
original,
and
that
is
this
case.
and
in
parody
there
must
be
some
taking,
some
copying
of
a
certain
sort,
because
that
is
the
purpose
of
parody,
to
borrow
from
the
original
and
then
to
imitate
and
ridicule
the
original,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
so,
yes,
there
does
have
to
be
some
taking
from
the
original,
the
music
in
this
case.
some
of
which
was
taken,
the
guitar
riffs
especially,
was
necessary
in
order
that
the
listener
would
know
that
what
was
being
made
fun
of
was
the
original.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is,
although
one
can
encourage
patriotism
without
necessarily
borrowing
the
music
from
another
tune,
although
historically
we
have
borrowed
from
other
tunes
to
have
patriotic
songs.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
for
this
case
i
can
limit
it
to
exactly
these
facts.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
as
long
as
the
parody
is
commenting
critically
upon
society,
be
it
cultural,
be
it
social...
the
social
aspect
of
society,
be
it
political,
the
use
of
the
tune
would
still
fall
within
the
definition
of
criticism,
which
has
to
have
some
breathing
room.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
sometimes
taking
that
tune
conveys
to
the
listener
something
extra.
this
court
has,
for
example,
the
home
box
office
video--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--but
the
tune...
justice
scalia,
the
tune
can
go
with
the
parody.
for
example,
there
is
a
video
that
the
court
has
in
this
case
where
the
beverly
hillbillies
is
used,
but
the
parody
is
called
capitol
hillbillies.
now,
using
the
beverly
hillbillies
evokes
a
certain
image,
and
then
the
criticism
that
is
conveyed
by
capitol
hillbillies,
the
parody,
is
useful.
i
think
that's
a
threshold
issue
here.
is
parody
useful?
is
criticism
useful?
and
107
of
the
copyright
law
does
say
that
criticism
is
useful
and
should
be
encouraged.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
it
is
useful,
but
pure
patriotism
without
making
the
political
comment,
critical
comment,
is
not
embraced
within
107,
although
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
something
worthwhile
of
protection.
obvicouly,
it
is.
but
we're
in
this
narrow
copyright
area
where
we
have
on
one
side
the
private
interest
of
the
copyright
holder,
versus
the
public
interest
and
the
historical
interest
of
promoting
creativity.
and
if
parody
does
have
a
creative
force
in
our
society,
and
we
suggest
that
it
does.
historically
it
does.
the
capitol
stepe
have
given
this
court--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
is
a
mixed
interest,
really,
on
the
copyright
holder's
side.
the
private
interest,
the
copyright
holder,
mr.
chief
justice,
takes
his
or
her
copyright,
subject
to
the
fair
use
statutory
provisions
in
107.
so
the
statute...
so
the
statute
tells
the
copyright
holder
you
may
have
to
put
up
with
some
use
of
your
work
that
will
be
a
fair
use,
for
the
greater
good
of
society.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
when
i
said
a
private
interest,
the
primary
thrust,
obviously,
in
a
copyright
case
is
protecting
that
private
interest.
the
larger
thrust
is
this
is
good
for
the
public,
and
i
concur
with
that.
but
a
fair
use
is
also
good
for
the
public,
and
that's
the
point--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--i'm
not,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
by
applying
a
presumption
that
if
it
is
a
commercial
parody,
then
it
is
presumptively
harmful
to
the
market.
and
they
drew
that
from
the
language
in
sony
and
harper
&
row
v.
nation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
our
position,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
you...
that
is
what
you
look
at,
justice
o'connor;
would
it
supplant
the
demand
for
the
original
work
in
many
or...
or
multiple
venues,
not
just
a
single
venue?
i
recognize
that
from
the
cases.
and
justice
story
in
folsom
v.
marsh
in
1841
talked
about
superseding
the
original,
and
that
goes
to
supplanting
the
original.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
it
did
not
adversely
effect
the
market.
it
did
not
supplant
the
original
orbison-dees
song.
it
did
not
impair
its
market.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
did
not.
it
applied
a
presumption.
the
sixth
circuit,
justice
o'connor,
basically
recognized
that
there
were
no
facts
in
this
case
adduced
by
acuff-rowe
to
show
that
its
market
for
the
original
song
had
been
materially
impaired.
and--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--no.
parody
can
be
successful.
you...
one
does
not
look,
justice
kennedy,
at
the
success
of
the
parody.
one
looks
at
the
harm
to
the
market
for
the
original
work.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
souter,
i
don't
have
any
difficulty
with
a
broad
definition
of
the
market.
what's
lacking
in
this
case
is
any
proof
that
any
market
for
the
orbison-dees
song
was
harmed.
all...
all
we
have
is
call
about
it,
but
no
proof
about
it.
and
i
think...
and
the
rule
that
i'm
suggesting
puts
this
case
in
a
trial
court
in
this
posture.
if
the
defendant
raises
the
affirmative
defense
of
fair
use
parody,
then
the
first
thing
the
defendant
must
show
is
that
it
is
a
parody,
and
then
the
four
factors
are
certainly
relevant:
purpose--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--this
case
was
decided
on
summary
judgment
on
the
affidavits.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
on
the
affidavits
that
were
submitted.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
there
was
nothing
in
the
affidavits
from
acuff-rose
which
created
a
genuine
issue
as
to
material
fact--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--about
impairment
of
their
market.
and
the
rule
i'm
suggesting,
which
is
a,
is
this
a
parody.
and
that's
a
matter
of
proof
and
that
goes
to
the
first
factor,
because
congress
has
said
consider
all
the
factors,
but
it
doesn't
limit
them
to
those
factors,
purpose
and
character.
purpose
is
parody.
parody
is
important.
parody
is
a
creative
force.
that's
the
purpose.
the
nature
of
the
work...
purpose
and
character,
i'm
sorry.
character,
commercial.
this
is
commercial,
so
that
would
enter
into
the
equation,
but
it
should
not
be
a
presumption
that
completely
eviscerating
the
rest
of
the
factors.
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
in
the
last
line
of
its
opinion:
"because
this
was
blatantly
commercial,
it
cannot
claim
fair
use.
"
that
simply
goes
too
far
and
it
does
not...
harper
&
row
and
sony
don't
carry
the
weight
assigned
to
it
in
the
context
of
parody.
those
were
copying
cases.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
ginsburg,
it...
it
has
both.
it's...
obviously,
the
courts
have
had
difficulty
with
how
one
uses
these
four
factors.
but
it
is
independently,
in
the
first
factor,
something
to
look
at;
is
this
a
commercial
use,
as
opposed
to
a
nonprofit
use,
an
educational
use?
the
american
association
of
law
schools
does
parodies
all
the
time,
from
the
time
of
llewellen
through
prosser,
but
those
were
not
for
profit
educational
kinds
of
uses.
so
it
would
be
something
to
look
at,
but
it's
not
decisive.
the
next
factor,
which
is
the
nature
of
the
work,
would,
in
this
case,
tend
to
favor
to
some
extent
the
orbison-dees
recording
because
it
is
a
creative
work...
work.
on
the
other
hand,
of
course,
the
parody
is
creative
itself,
but
i
could
give
points
to
orbison-dees
on
the
second
factor.
the
third
factor
is
an
interesting
one
in
this
case,
the
amount
and
substantiality
of
the
taking.
and,
of
course,
in
a
parody,
in
order
to
evoke
the
original,
one
must
take
a
substantial
part.
so
in
those
situations
we
are
going
to
have
substantial
taking,
especially
if
we're
talking
about,
as
we
are
in
this
case,
a
parody
of
the
original,
a
criticism
of
the
original.
in
this
case
there
was
taking
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
some
of
the
orbison-dees
song
was
taken.
but
the
fourth
factor,
which
this
court
has
said
is
the
single
most
important
factor,
that's
the
key,
and
that's
the
key,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
protecting
the
copyright
holder's
interest.
has
he
or
she
been
harmed?
has
there
market
been
harmed
or
supplanted?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
you
have
not
in
the
two
cases,
sony
and
harper
&
row.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
you're
right,
justice
scalia.
but
in
this
case
it
was
not
determined
solely
on
the
fourth
factor.
the
court
looked
at
all
of
the
factors
and
found
on
amount
and
copying,
for
example,
that
he
took
what
had
to
be
taken.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
that
alone
cannot
be.
parody
is
something
that
has
to
be
looked
at.
there
was
no
dispute
this
was
a
parody.
i
mean,
the
district
court
did,
i
think,
the
proper
analysis
in
this
case.
what's
the
purpose
of
this
work?
parody.
what
was
it,
the
character?
commercial,
yes.
and
then
went
through
all
of
the
factors
and
found,
using
this
court's
language,
single
most
important
factor
that
there
was--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--they
were
not.
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
converted
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
justice
ginsburg,
and
then
acuff-rose
opposed
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
an
affidavit
which
the
district
court
found
did
not
address,
at
all,
the
market
impairment
issue
or
any
of
the
other
issues.
it
didn't
address
the
parody
issue.
two...
there
are
two
affidavits--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--because
acuff-rose
failed
to
put
forward
any
evidence
in
affidavit
form
that
created
a
genuine
issue
as
to
material
fact
on
the
important
factors:
parody,
number
one.
the
amount
of
the
taking
there
was
no
dispute
about.
their
affidavit
of
mr.
spielman
is
basically
uncontested.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
only
if
the
party
opposing
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
had
put
in
affidavits
which
were
sufficient
to
create
a
genuine
issue
as
to
material
doubt
on
that
fact,
but
they
were
not
put
in.
this
doesn't
mean
that
in
some
case
where
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
on
that
issue,
that
the
case
will
not
go
to
trial.
it
would
go
to
trial.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
at
page
321
of
the
joint
appendix
there
is
an
affidavit
that
was
filed
after
the
judgment
was
entered,
although
the
district
judge
allowed
the
record
to
be
supplemented,
of
mr.
flowers
who
is
a
licensing
agent
for
acuff-rose.
and
if
one
reads
that
affidavit,
there's
just
general
talk
in
there
about
what
people
may
like
to
do
and
what
acuff-rose
may
like
to
do,
but
there's
nothing
that
addresses...
even
if
one
gives
this
late-filed
affidavit
any
credence
in
this
case,
nothing
that
addresses
whether
or
not
their
market
has
been
materially
impaired.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
scalia,
this
court
has
said
that
fair
use
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
and
on
the
record
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
no
evidence
on
any
of
the
four
factors
that
created
genuine
issues
as
to
material
fact.
so
it's
not
that
one
factor
was
disputed.
if
one
factor
was
disputed
in
a
way
that
created
a
genuine
issue
as
to
material
fact
and
then,
in
the
equation,
one
couldn't
make
the
fair
use
finding
without
litigating
that
factor,
then
summary
judgment
would
not
be
proper.
but
it
was
proper.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
ultimate
burden
is
to
show
fair
use
as
the
affirmative
defense
as
these
factors
unfold.
and
i
think
this
goes
to
the
presumption,
mr.
chief
justice...
when
the
plaintiff
files
the
lawsuit,
all
the
plaintiff
need
show
is
ownership
of
the
copyright
and
copying,
and
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant
to
raise
the
fair
use
affirmative
defense.
and
in
this
case
the
defendant
did,
raising
parody
as
a
form
of
criticism
protected
by
fair
use
under
the
statute,
and
with
affidavits
saying
there
was
no
material
impairment
of
the
market.
and
then
it
shifts
back
to
the
plaintiff
to
burst
the
bubble
of
the
presumption,
if
one
exists,
and
show
that
there
was
either,
a,
not
a
parody,
or,
a
and
b,
it
was
not
a
parody
and
it
did
materially
impair
the
market.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
presumption
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
relied
upon,
language
drawn
from
this
court's
cases
in
harper
&
row,
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
harm.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that's
right.
the
presumption
of
economic
harm
if
it
is
a
commercial
use.
but,
of
course,
that
was
commercial
copying,
not
commercial
parody.
there's
a
difference
between
parody
which
performs
a
critical
role
in
society--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--and
that
burden
was
met,
mr.
chief
justice,
by
our
affidavits.
the
district
judge
found
that
to
be
so.
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
to
be
so.
indeed,
in
this
case
what
happened
is
the
summary
judgment
of
the
trial
court
was
reversed
and
summary
judgment
was
entered
for
acuff-rose
on
the
very
same
record
that
had
been
tried
below.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
my
client's
duty
in
raising
the
affirmative
defense
was
to
put
on
evidence
that
a
reasonable
person
or
jury
could
listen
to
and
believe
and
conclude
there
was
no
material
impairment
of
the
market.
that
was
done.
it
was
not
specifically
directed
to
other
derivative
markets
and
other
derivative
pleas.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
did
not.
but
the
opposing
affidavit
did
not
create
a
genuine
issue
with
regard
to
that.
the
closest
they
might
try--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--but
if...
but
if
there
is
no
attempt
by
the
plaintiff,
really,
to
fill
in
that
blank
and
to
make
that
a
disputed
issue
of
fact,
then
the
district
court
could
give
summary
judgment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
am,
justice
ginsburg.
some
evidence...
some
evidence
to
make
that
showing.
then
the
burden
would
shift
back
to
the
plaintiff,
sort
of
like
the
st.
mary's
v.
honor
center--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--there
was
nothing
that
specifically
addressed
a
derivative
market
for
rap
works.
what
was--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--not
if
it
was
not
a
parody.
i
mean
the
threshold
is
is
this
a
parody.
just
simply
a
rap
version
of
oh,
pretty
woman
would
not
qualify
under
the
fair
use
doctrine.
that
would
be
mere
copying
for
a
commercial
use,
and
no--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
would
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
the
plaintiff
of
copyright
infringement.
the
defendant
would
then
have
the
burden
of--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--of
the
parody.
that
would
be
entitled
to
a
fair
use
claim.
there's
nothing
the
matter
with
making
fun
of
the
people
making
fun
of
the
original.
in
fact,
that
is,
if
we
believe
in...
in
creativity,
if
we
believe
in
some
humor--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--he
has
a
copyright
on
the
album,
which
would
include,
presumably,
the
parody.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
the
thrust
of
my
case,
justice
kennedy,
is
not
that.
the
thrust
of
my
case
is
that
if
a
parody
is
a
creative,
true
parodic
work,
then
is
it...
it
is
entitled
to
be
called
a
fair
use
unless
there
is
evidence
that
it
has
materially
impaired
or
supplanted
the
market
for
the
original.
the
original
does
not
hold
the
absolute
right
to
preclude
any
other
use
of
that
original
work.
and
the
fact
that
280,000
or
2,000
records
were
sold
is
not
the
decisive
fact
here.
the
decisive
fact
is
that
the
court
below
applied
a
presumption
that
if
it's
commercial,
it
cannot
be
a
fair
use.
that
simply
is
wrong.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
sony
and
harper
&
row
frame
this
case.
sony
says
there
must
be
some
meaningful
likelihood
of
future
harm
to
the
copyright
holder,
and
harper
&
row
gives
life
to
that
formulation.
in
harper
&
row
the
market
was
supplanted.
time
magazine
decided
not
to
pay
12,500
to
harper
&
row
because
the
nation
had
taken
president
ford's
words
and
published
them,
copied
them
without
permission.
that
gives,
i
think,
the
framework
for
deciding
this
case.
meaningful
likelihood
of
harm,
there
is
none
here.
i
hear
this
talk
about
they
might
want
to
do
a
rap
version
at
some
point.
there's
nothing
to
keep
them
from
licensing
a
rap
version.
but
this
is
a
parody--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--justice
scalia--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--and
there's...
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
he
is
right.
this
is
1
cut
out
of
10
on
the
record.
this
album
was
not
named...
the
2
live
crew
album
was
not
named
pretty
woman,
it
was
named
as
clean
as
they
wanna
be.
and
this
was
1
cut
out
of
10.
so
this
kind
of
argumentation
about
what
might
be,
what
might
have...
what
might
have
occurred,
why
they
sold
it,
how
they
sold
it,
is
completely
belied
by
any
facts
in
this
record;
here's
how
they
could
prove
their
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not...
not
necessarily.
we
would
still
have
fair
use
and
we
would
still
argue
fair
use.
but
it
would
look
much
different
in
terms
of
how
fair
was
it,
if
they
were
trying
to
confuse
people.
but
this
is
not
a
lanham
act
case.
this
is
a
record
that's
out
there.
one
cut
uses
oh,
pretty
woman,
and
makes
fun
of
oh,
pretty
woman.
was
that
fair?
we
submit
it
is
fair
unless
they
can
show
that
their
market
was
materially
impaired,
supplanted.
and
how
could
they
do
it?
i
think
this
is
helpful.
they
could
do
it
by
showing
that
they
had
someone
to
whom
they
were
going
to
license
this.
but
the
truth
is
they
don't
want
to
license
this
as
a
parody.
and
one
can
understand
that.
most
authors
don't
want
to
give
a
license
to
someone
to
make
fun
of
their
work--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--and
they
could--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--they
do
need
to
show,
as
in
harper
&
row
v.
nation,
that
there
is
some
meaningful
likelihood
that
there
is
someone
to
whom
they
would
license
this.
and
that
is
completely--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
won't
say
that
that
is
our
total
burden.
our
burden
is
to
make
some
showing
that
this
would
not
impair
their
market.
the
ultimate
burden
is
upon
them
to
show
they
were
injured
by
the
loss
of
a
market,
just
as
harper
&
row
showed
they
were
injured
by
the
publication
in
the
nation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
