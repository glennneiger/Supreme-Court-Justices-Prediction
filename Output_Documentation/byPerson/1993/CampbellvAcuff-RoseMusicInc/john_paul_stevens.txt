they
did,
of
course,
offer
to
pay
for
it,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
to
the...
and
why
didn't
you
accept
the
offer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
really
wanted
to
prevent
this...
you
really
wanted
to
prevent
this
music
from
being
distributed
at
all,
as
i
understand
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
prevail...
if
you
prevail,
would
it
be
an
adequate
remedy
to
just
give
you
royalties
for
the
amount
of
their
sales?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
thought
the
record
was
otherwise,
that
you
gave
them
a
flat
no,
you
weren't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
weren't
willing
to
negotiate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have...
if
they'd
been
deceptive
and
had
not
revealed
the
true
author.
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
that,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
fact
they
offered
to
pay
you
royalties
and
the
fact
they
were
candid
about
the
true
origin
of
the
work
tends
to
cut
in
their
favor
rather
than
the
other
way.
maybe
i'm--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
there
about
the
similarity
of
the
two
works
and
so
forth?
do
you
think
their
version
changed
the
basic
melody
or
fundamental
character
of
the
work,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
change
the
melody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
didn't
entirely
supplant
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
you
say
if
another
group
used
a
rap
version
but
didn't
change
the
words
at
all,
but
changed
it
from
rock
to
rap?
would
that
be...
could
they
have
gotten
a
compulsory
license
or
would
that
have
changed
the
fundamental
character?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
long
as
there's
a
parody
element
in
it,
it
can't
be,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
the
thing
that's
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is
you
seem
to
be
categorically
confident
that
there
could
be
no
compulsory
license
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
seems
to
me...
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
where
the
line
between--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
has...
but
it
has
to
be
fundamental
change.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
can't
change...
just
leave
out
the
"oh"
from
"oh,
pretty
woman",
that
wouldn't
be
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
last
question?
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
you
acknowledge
that
you
would
agree
this
was
a
parody.
how
do
you
define
parody
when
you
make
that
concession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
just
one
very
brief
question.
do
you
think
you
were
entitled
to
a
compulsory
license
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't.
