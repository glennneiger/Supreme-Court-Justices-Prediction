justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rogow,
you
started
out
by
defining
parody,
and
that
first
step,
i
think
the
sixth
circuit,
even
if
grudgingly,
took
and
said,
yes,
this
falls
within
parody.
but
you're
not
saying
that
if
it's
parody,
it
is
necessarily
a
permissible
fair
use.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
in
the...
since
the
fifth
circuit...
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
you
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
parody,
where
did
the
sixth
circuit
go
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rogow,
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
that
you
would
suspend
the
commercial
aspect
of
it,
if
we're
going
down
this
list
of
factors,
and
kind
of
fold
that
into
the
last
factor?
is
that...
does
commercial
have
any
independent
significance
for
you,
or
does
it
really
weigh
in
evaluating
the
fourth
factor,
that
is
the
effect
of
the
use
on
the
potential
market
for
the
copyrighted
work?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why...
why
was
it
appropriate
not
to
afford
an
opportunity
to
have
that
issue
developed
at
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
concentrate
on
this
last
factor
which,
under
your
analysis,
is
the
most
critical.
shouldn't
there
have
been
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
there
was
a
market
out
there
that
the
copyright
holder
could
have
exploited?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there...
wasn't
there
a
suggestion
that
the
copyright
holder
might
want
to
exploit...
exploit
a
rap
market?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
plaintiff
opposed
summary
judgment
and
i'm
not
clear
now
on
your
position
about
whose
burden
this
fourth
factor
is.
if
you
raised
the...
if
you
raise
it
there,
you
as
defense,
are
you
now
recognizing
that
it
is...
it
would
be
your
burden
to
show
the
absence
of
an
effect
on
the
market
for
the
copyrighted
work?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was...
what
was
your
evidence
with
respect
to
the
derivative
market,
to
rap
works?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
there
would
be
another
rap
version
of
this
composition.
would
that
be
a
fair
use?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
different
lyrics,
some
variation
in
the
musical
presentation,
whose
copyright...
would
that
infringe
anyone's
copyright
at
this
stage,
suppose
there
were
another
version?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
plaintiff?
suppose
we
have
a
rap
version
now
that
has
different
lyrics
than
the
2
live
crew,
slightly
different
presentation
of
the
music,
and
the
claim
is
made
this
is
a
parody
of
the
parody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
campbell
have
a
copyright
in
the
parody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
in
dictum,
wasn't
it?
that
was
not
a
holding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosdeitcher,
you...
you
cited
judge
lavalle,
and
you
that's
an
idea
that
he
put
forward,
that
it...
even
if
this
were
found
to
be
taking
too
much
and
therefore
an
infringement,
it
doesn't
follow
like
the
night
the
day
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
stop
it,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
follow
from
the
fact...
even
if
a
court
held
that
this
parody
took
too
much
and
that,
looking
at
the
four
factors,
you
win
and
you
establish
infringement.
but
you
have
featured
judge
lavalle
and
you
know
he
has
put
forth
a
very
interesting
idea
that
there
may
be
infringements
that
are
not
properly
subject
to
injunction
because
you
take
into
account
the
value
of
parody.
you
take
into
account
first
amendment
concerns
not
simply
on
the
liability
side,
but
on
the
remedy
side.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
take
the
sweet
but
not
the
bitter
from
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
do
you
find
his
thinking--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
attached
a
check,
didn't
they,
in
fact?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
a
check?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosdeitcher,
am
i
wrong
in
remembering
that
in
one
of
the
cases
that
you
referred
to,
the
rear
window
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
that
a
case
where
there
was
no
injunction,
there
was
damages
but
no
injunction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
compulsory
license
include
words
or
just
music?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
ask
for
it
in
the
district
court,
did
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
trial
counsel
was
far
less
sure
of
that
that
you
are,
and
never
asked...
never
asked
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court.
why
didn't
they
ask
for
summary
judge...
i
don't
know.
i
wasn't...
i
wasn't
there
at
the
time.
the
strategy
in
the
district
court,
as
i
saw
it
from
the
record,
was
to
establish
issues
of
fact.
i,
frankly,
do
not
feel
there
are
issues
of
fact
and
that
the
issues
here
are
absolutely
clear.
but
they've
exploited
our
work
for
a
profit,
they're
freeriding
on
our
music,
and
that,
in
addition,
they
have
impaired
a
market
which
we
are
entitled
to
exploit.
and
that
therefore
all
of
the
factors,
the
first
factor
being
predominantly
commercial
here
because
of
the
exploitation
of
this
music
for
profit.
the
second
factor,
which
is
basically
conceded...
but
there's
an
additional
thing
to
the
second
factor,
the
nature
of
the
work.
this
is
music.
music's
lifeblood
is
adaptability.
what
makes
a
song
in
the
1960's
a
great
song
may
not
make
it
a
great
song
in
the
1970's,
and
as
the
record
shows
and
one
of
their
briefs
shows
in
the
record,
we
then
had
the
song
done
in
the
hard
rock
style,
from
the
soft
rock
to
the
hard
rock.
and
now
we're
in
the
eighties
and
nineties
and
they've
shown
that
you
can
now
take
that
rock
song
and,
as
many
rap
artists
have
done,
convert
it
to--
--to
a
rap.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean
it
would
be
a
different
case
if
they
had
packaged
this
as
a
separate
tape
with
only
the
oh,
pretty
woman
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
you
needed
to
you...
i
thought
you
conceded
last
time
around
that
there
wasn't
such
a
thing,
that
this
is
your
burden.
you
have
to
show
that
there
is
no
market
that
they
could
exploit
that
you
have
made
an
inroad
on
by
virtue
of
this
recording?
