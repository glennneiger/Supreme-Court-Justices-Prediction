chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
92-1292,
luther
r.
campbell
v.
acuff-rose
music,
inc.--
mr.
rogow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
copyright
states
suggest
that
there's
a
strong
public
interest
in
protecting
the
copyright
holder.
so
i...
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
difficult
to
suggest,
as
you
do,
that
there's
only
a
private
interest
on
one
side,
where
there's
a
great
public
interest
on
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
i
don't...
i
don't
doubt
for
a
minute
what
you
say
the
statute
says.
but
you're
suggesting...
that
there's
only
a
private
interest
on
one
side
while
there's
only
a
large...
while
there's
a
large
public
interest
on
the
other,
i
don't
think
is
accurate.
i
think
the
statute
itself
suggests
there's
a
strong
public
interest
in
encouraging
works
that
can
be
copyrighted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
fair
use
an
affirmative
defense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
burden
of
negating
fair
use
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
then,
is
on
the
person
claiming
the
fair
use?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
presumption
you're
talking
about,
the
bubble
bursting?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
it
seems
to
me
if
your
view
prevails,
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
ought
to
be
reversed.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
we
ought
to
direct
judgment
here
for
your
client,
in
view
of
the
burden...
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
fair
use
being
on
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rogow.
mr.
rosdeitcher.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wait
a
minute,
i
didn't
quite
get
it.
the
salinger
letters?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't--
--you
say
they
purported
to
deposit.
i
mean,
how
do
you
purport
to
deposit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
did
deposit.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rosdeitcher,
in
the...
i
presume
there
were
reviews
in
various
periodicals
of
the
rap
version?
does
the
record
show
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'd
be
curious
to
know
whether
it
was
recognized
in
those
reviews
as
a
parody
or
just
another
rap
or
music.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosdeitcher.
mr.
rogow,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rogow.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.92-1292,
luther
b.
campbell
versus
acuff-rose
music,
inc.
in
1964
the
respondent,
acuff-rose,
obtained
the
rights
to
a
rock
ballad
called
"oh
pretty
woman".
petitioners
luther
campbell
and
others
are
collectively
known
as
2
live
crew,
a
rap
music
group.
in
1989,
campbell
wrote
a
song
entitled
"pretty
woman"
which
he
described
is
intended
through
comical
lyrics
to
satirize
the
original
song
written
25
years
earlier.
2
live
crew
sought
permission
to
use
the
original
song
and
offered
payment,
but
acuff-rose
said
no.
nonetheless,
2
live
crew
released
records,
cassette
tapes,
and
compact
discs
of
pretty
woman
in
a
collection
of
songs
entitled
"as
clean
as
they
wanna
be".
when
acuff-rose
sued
2
live
crew
and
its
record
company
for
copyright
infringement,
2
live
crew
raised
the
defense
of
fair
use
within
the
meaning
of
the
copyright
act.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
2
live
crew
reasoning
that
2
live
crew's
song
was
a
parody
that
made
fair
use
of
the
original.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed.
it
concerted
among
other
things,
that
the
blatantly
commercial
purpose
of
the
parody
prevented
it
from
being
a
fair
use.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
2
live
crew's
commercial
parody
could
be
a
fair
use.
as
explained
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
souter,
we
now
reverse
and
remand.
a
parody
like
other
commented
criticism
may
claim
to
be
fair
use,
and
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
placing
virtually
dispositive
weight
on
the
commercial
nature
of
the
parody.
a
parody's
commercial
character
is
only
one
element
to
be
weighed
in
a
fair
use
inquiry.
the
heart
of
any
parodist's
claim
to
quote
from
existing
material
is
the
use
of
some
elements
of
a
prior
author's
composition
to
create
a
new
one
that
at
least
in
part
comments
on
that
author's
work,
as
2
live
crew's
song
reasonably
could
be
perceived
as
doing
here.
and
so,
the
court
of
appeals
we
hold
is
wrong
in
directing
the
entry
of
judgment
for
the
copyright
holder.
there
are
factual
issues
regarding
excessive
copying
and
market
substitution
which
are
still
to
be
resolved
and
to
be
addressed
on
remand.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
