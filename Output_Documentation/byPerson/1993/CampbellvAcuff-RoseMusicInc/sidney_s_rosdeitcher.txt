mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
argument
i
just
heard
seems
to
have
omitted
three
decisions
of
this
court.
and
i'd
like
to
talk
about
those
three
decisions,
and
those
were
sony,
harper
&
row,
and
stewart
v.
abend.
in
each
of
those
opinions
this
court,
presumably
looking
at
the
first
factor,
namely
the
factor
of
purpose
and
character
of
the
use,
stated
unequivocally
that
every
commercial
use
of
copyrighted
material
is
presumptively
unfair.
now,
there's
been
no
discussion
of
that
here,
and
in
fact
it's
overlooked.
in
the
petitioner's
view
once
it's
a
parody
you
look
to
the
impairment
of
the
market.
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
impairment
of
the
market,
because
there's
substantial
evidence
of
impairment
of
the
derivative
market,
including
the
market
for
rap
versions.
but
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
significance
of
that
commercial
presumption.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
that
was
in
dictum
in...
yes,
it
was
in
dictum
in
each
of
the
cases.
but
in
harper
&
row
it
was
not
in
dictum.
as
i
recall,
in
harper
&
row
they
applied
that
presumption
to
the
work.
and
it
was
in
dictum
in
sony.
and
it
was
not
in
dictum
in
stewart
and
abend.
indeed
in
stewart
v.
abend,
it
was
applied
in
a
very
straightforward
fashion.
the
court
said
hitchcock
and
stewart
made
12
million
on
rear
window
and
that
was
enough
to
meet
the
presumption.
but
my
view
of
the
presumption
is
a
little
subtler
than
i
think
petitioners
give
us
credit
for,
or
even
give
the
sixth
circuit
credit
for.
and
the
sixth
circuit
could
have
been
clearer
on
this,
i
acknowledge,
but
i
believe
that
the
commercial
use
presumption
means
something
like
this.
you
have
to
look
at
the
commerciality
to
see
what
purpose
the
so-called
parodist
or
news
reporter
or
critic
or
comment...
commentator
is
doing.
there's
a
wonderful
article
by
judge
lavalle
in
wnich
he
modestly
reassesses
his
own
opinion
on
the
salinger
letters
case,
and
he
acknowledges
he
made
an
error.
he
was
ultimately
reversed
by
the
second
circuit
but
he
acknowledges
he
made
an
error.
he
said
the
letters
were
being
used
for
purposes
of
biography.
but
he
saw
something
else
in
reviewing
the
record,
and
that
was
that
the
letters
were
also
being
used
to
dazzle,
to
have
a
good
read,
just
not
for
the
purpose
of
biography,
but
to
sell
the
work
for
the
expressive
value
of
the
underlying
copyrighted
material.
that's
what
happened
in
harper
&
row.
the
nation
was
engaged
in
news
reporting,
but
the
court
said
that
the
nation
went
further
and
was
expressing...
and
was
exploiting
the
300
words
taken
verbatim
from
president
ford's
book
for
their
expressive
value
so
that
people
would
know
it's
ford
speaking.
now,
that's
what
happened
here.
they
took
my
client's
music,
partly
for
parody,
let's
assume
that.
i
will...
if
you
want
me,
i
can
talk
about
the
definition
of
parody.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
and
i'm
accepting
that.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
want
to
leave
with
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
but
they
took
the
music
not
just
for
parody.
when
you
look
at
this
record...
and
the
best
thing
in
the
record
is
to
listen
to
the
two
tapes...
you
see
that
they
were
doing
something
more.
after
all,
they
were
selling
a
rap
album.
there's
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
this
record
that
they
were
selling
a
parody
record.
they
were
selling
a
rap
album
to
what
they
acknowledge,
according
to
their
expert...
and
i'll
come
to
the
use...
utility
of
his
affidavits.
but
according
to
their
expert,
and
they
adopt
that
view,
that
the
record
was
being
sold
to
an
audience...
what
they
described
as
an
audience
of
urban
black
youth
or
disaffected
black
urban
youth.
we
dispute
that
the
parody...
that
the
rap
music
is
so
limited.
but
that's
what
they
say.
not
that
it
was
directed
to
a
parody
audience,
but
directed
to
a
wide
audience
for
rap
music.
rap
music
is
danceable
music.
rap
music
needs
music.
and
they
took
our
music.
now
how
do
we
know
that--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
yes,
it
can
be
a
fair
use.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
right,
but
in
the...
correct.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
made
a
profit
is
enough
to
change
the
equation.
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--yes.
but
let
me
go
back
to
judge
lavalle's
example
and
then
we
use
our
example.
the
author
was
using
the
salinger
letters
for
a
biography,
but
as
he
pointed
out,
they
went
further,
they
took
too
much.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
the
salinger
letters
case,
the
second
circuit
in
the
southern
district.
and
we
refer
to
a...
we
refer
to
the
case
in
our
brief.
judge
lavalle
said
that
his
mistake
was
in
not
recognizing
that
they
did
more
than
just
take
enough
to
serve
the
interests
of
biography.
they
were
anxious
to
sell
the
beauty
and
dazzling
quality
of
the
letter.
and
what
i'm
saying
in
this
case
is
it's
not
just
that
they
profited
from
the
parody.
they
profited
here,
in
addition,
because
they
needed
music
and
they
needed
dazzling,
good
music,
and
they
took
one
of
the
great
rock
and
roll
classics--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--no,
we...
well,
if
that's,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
your
honor,
you
can
have
a
parody
that
takes
too
much.
that
is,
i
can
write
a
parody.
and,
indeed,
that's
what
i'm
fearful
of.
i
think
that
is
the
great
danger.
one
can
write
parodic
lyrics
and
take
all
the
music
or
most
of
the
music,
and
sell
and
sell
and
profit
by
and
exploit
and
take
advantage
of
the
music.
and
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
on
their
conclusion
that
it's
fair
use,
they
get
the
profit,
they
get
a
copyright
on
their
recording.
they
presumably
will
claim
a
copyright
on
the
derivative
work
that
we
can't,
because
it's
allegedly
fair
use
and
fair
game,
so
that
anybody,
any
other
rap
artist--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--that's
because,
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
and
do
some
balancing.
and
this
came
up
earlier
in
the
chief
justice's
remarks
which
were
made
so
well
in
harper
&
row.
but
the
copyright
protection
itself
is
an
engine
of
free
expression
and
is
designed
to
encourage
dissemination
of
ideas
and
creativity.
in
this
case,
if
you
allow
the
taking
of
as
much
as
they
took...
and
could
i
take
a
moment
to
give
you
what
i
think
are
the
salient
facts
to
tell
you
what's
going
on?
this...
what's
going
on
in
this
case
is
not
about
parody.
i'll
accept
there's
a
parody
there.
this
case
is
about
selling
rap
music
by...
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
scholars
that
we
refer
to,
professor
light
or
mr.
light,
in
an
article
in
the
south
atlantic
quarterly
which
is
referred
in
our
brief,
much
of
rap
is...
much
of
rap
is
sold
by
fusing
a
street
message,
as
mr.
light
says,
with
pop
music.
and
he
gives
a
wonderful
example
of
how
this
whole
phenomenon
started,
and
it
gives...
and
it
throws
light
on
what's
happened
here.
there
was
a
very
famous
hard
rock
song
called
walk
this
way
by
aerosmith.
another
group,
another
rap
group,
run
dmc,
decided
that
they
would
change
that
into
a
rap
song.
they
actually
hired
the
guitarist
from
the
aerosmith
group
to
do
it
and
they
did
it.
they
made
a
rap
song
with
hard
rock
music
and
they
sold
it...
it
was
the
greatest
rap
hit,
at
that
time,
ever.
and
i'd
like
to
read
you
what
mr.
light
concludes
from
this
and
how
he
describes
what
happened
thereafter
in
rap.
"rap
was
established
as
a
viable
pop
form,
at
least
as
long
as
its
connections
to
the
traditional
rock
and
roll
spirit
were
made
explicit.
"
now,
that's
what
happened
here.
let
me
just
review
a
few
of
the
very
simple
facts
to
show
you
that
what
happened
here
was
they
took
our
music
in
order
to
have
a
free
ride
on
our
good
music
and
make
a
profit
from
our
good
music.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
your
honor,
we
did
not
think
that
was
the
best
vehicle
for
exploiting
the
market.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
your
honor,
my
client...
as
part
of
the...
as
part
of
the
marketability
of
the
copyrighted
work,
you
have
to
have
the
right
to
say
no.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
and
if
it
is
not
a
fair
use,
we
had
a
right
to
say
no,
that
this
wasn't
the
way
to
best
exploit
the
rap
market.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
creating
a
kind
of
compulsory
license
which
doesn't
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
your
honor,
i'd
be...
i'd
be
very
reluctant
to
follow
down...
follow
judge
lavalle
all
the
way
down
that
path
for
this
reason.
congress
gave
very
careful
consideration
to--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--yes.
[laughter]
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
and
that
is
because--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--the
reason...
i'm
sorry.
the
reason
why
i
don't
think
i
would
take
it
to
that
length
is
congress
spent
an
enormous
amount
of
time...
my
colleagues
here
worked
on
this...
on
the
question
of
the
compulsory
license
and
the
scope
of
the
compulsory
license.
congress
has
fashioned
a
compulsory
license.
if
congress
feels
that
there
are
additional
areas
for
compulsory
licenses,
i
think
that's
an
area
that
requires
testimony
from
the
music
industry,
that
requires
testimony
from
other
people,
from
parodists,
from
everyone,
so
that
legislative
judgment
which
was
made
in
the
case
of
songs
that
do
not
change
the
fundamental
character
of
the
work
are
subject
to
a
compulsory
license.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
that's
entirely
possible.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
that
is
entirely
possible.
and,
in
fact,
judge...
justice
scalia.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
we
gave
them
a
flat...
we
gave
them
a
flat
no.
but
i
wanted
to
say--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--that
the
fact
that
in
this
case
my
client
gave
them
a
flat
no
doesn't
mean
that
somebody
else
won't
bargain.
and
that
question
of
market
failure
was
never
really
explored
in
the
record.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
the
record...
what
the
record
shows...
and
i
think
this
is
helpful
to
my
notion
of
exploitation
of
the
underlying
work.
the
record
shows
this
background,
and
it's
the
letter
attached
to
mr.
campbell's
affidavit
which
appears
at
page...
at
page
87
of
the
record.
the
record
shows
that
two...
and
this
is,
i
think,
wonderful
background
to
this.
they
started
out
by
saying
that
they
already
had
released
two
albums,
and
that
they
were
now
going
to
release
their
third.
that
the
two
other
albums
were
very
successful
commercially,
that
both
of
them
had
gone
gold,
one
of
them
was
close
to
platinum,
that
they
were
high
up
on
the
rap
charts...
not
on
the
parody
charts,
on
the
rap
music
charts.
and
they
told
us
if
you
give
us
a
license
at
the
statutory
rate...
which,
incidentally,
was
not
applicable
here
because
compulsory
license
doesn't
apply...
we
will
sell
this
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
homes.
now,
they
did
have
a
track
record.
they
had
a
track
record
of
selling
lots
and
lots
of
records.
now,
my
client
decided
that
they
did
not
think
this
was
a
good
way
to
exploit
this
market
and
exercised
their
right
as
copyright
owners
to
say
no,
a
right
which
is
absolutely
essential
if
they
are
to
have
a
marketable
copyright.
i
take
that
history
and
i
add
to
that
history
the
fact
that
they
then
took
this
record,
they
took
our
song...
now,
the
amount
of
song
has
been
underplayed
by
petitioners,
it's
been
underplayed
by
the
district
court.
what
they
took
was,
if
you...
when
you
listen
to
these
two
tapes,
the
first
thing
you
hear
when
you
hear
the
orbison
and
dees
record
is
a
wonderful,
powerful,
dynamic,
jolting
guitar
riff
that
is
so
famous
and
begins
that
work.
that
guitar
riff
then
is
played
throughout
the
orbison
and
dees
work,
and
then
you
hear
the
pretty
woman
melody,
which
is
very
familiar.
they
took
the
guitar
riff.
now,
in
the
orbison
and
dees
work
they
play
it
10
times.
they
played
it
16
times.
at
one
point
they
play
it
8
times.
they
played
it
because
it's
one
of
the
most
wonderful,
danceable,
dynamic
musical
works
of
rock
and
roll...
this
record
of
orbison
and
dees
was
one
of
the
all-time
hits...
and
they
played
it
over
and
over
again
to
dazzle,
to
have
a
good
hear,
to
have
a
good
dance.
and
then
they
say
we
can
now
profit
and
free
ride
on
the
genius
of
roy
orbison
and
bill
dees.
that's
what
they
were
about.
when
they
sold
the
record,
they
didn't
put
parody,
they
didn't
give
it
another
name.
they
called
it
pretty
woman,
they
dropped
the
word
"oh".
if
you
look
at
their
letter,
they
think
the
name
of
our
song
is
pretty
woman.
they
call
it
pretty
woman.
they're
asking
for
a
license
on
pretty
woman.
they
then
say...
it's
written
by
roy
orbison
and
bill
dees.
it's
published
by
my
client.
let's
talk
about
that
in
terms
of
market...
let
me
turn
to
market,
because
i
think
that
shows
enough
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
they
were
trying
to
exploit
pretty
woman
by
bill
orbison...
roy
orbison
and
bill
dees.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
except
for
this,
there's...
i
won't
dwell
on
this
too
much,
but
there
is
something
disingenuous
about
this
letter.
luther
campbell
testified
that
the
record,
that
is
this
album,
was
released
in
june
of
1989.
the
letter
comes
to
us,
and
if
you
read
the
letter
it
plainly
suggests
that
we're
coming
to
ask
your
permission.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
pardon?
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
later
on.
as
i
understand,
the
check
came
later
on.
in
the
court
proceeding
a
year
later
they
purported
to
deposit
13,000,
which
they
said
was
the
statutory
rate,
which,
incidentally,
did
not
apply,
and
they
deposited
it
in
court.
and
the
check
wasn't...
the
check
was
not
sent
with
this
letter.
the
check
was
deposited
in
court
a
year
later
when
we
sued
them.
that's
when
the
check
was
deposited.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i'm
sorry.
they
did
deposit,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i'm
so
used
to
purported
and
allegedlies,
that
i'm--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
your
honor,
i
just
don't
recall.
i'd
have
to
look
at
the
case,
but
i
just
don't
recall.
they
may...
that
may
be.
and
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
go
on
to
two
points
before
i
finish.
one
is
the
impairment
of
the
market
issue
and
the
other
is
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
which
is
kind
of
interesting;
who
gets
summary
judgment
or
should
anybody
get
summary
judgment.
on
the
impairment
of
the
market,
the
court
asked
earlier
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
of
a
market
for
a
rap
version
of
our
song.
well,
of
course...
of
course
there's
evidence
in
the
record.
there's
indisputable
evidence
in
the
record.
248,000
albums,
as
of
the
date
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
containing
our
song
were
sold
to
a
rap
market.
by
their
letter,
that's
what
they
were
aimed
at
and
that's
what
they
were
selling
to.
there's
other
evidence
in
the
record,
in
mr.
flowers'
affidavit
he
reports
that
the
brothers
make
3
told
us
that
they
had
sampled,
which
means
they
duplicated,
the
entire
chorus
section
of
our
song
to
use
it
as
a
hook,
meaning
something
catchy
to
attract
people
in
a
rap
song
that
they
were
doing,
and
then
they
asked
for
a
license.
and
so
there's
evidence,
plain
evidence
that
there's
a
rap
market
for
our
song.
the
articles
that
we
cite
show
that
there's
a
vast
market
for
rock
and
roll
music
of
our
kind
in--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--the
record...
unfortunately,
the
record
doesn't
show
any
of
that,
your
honor--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--your
honor,
i...
if
i
can
go
off
the
record,
i
originally
bought
this
record
when
i
was
in
the
running
for
coming
onto
this
case.
i
went
into
sam
goody
and
i
went
to
the
rap
section
and
i
pulled
this
off
the
shelf
next
to
2
live
crew's
other
rap
songs.
that's
where
the...
that's
where
it's
viewed.
that's
where
it's
sold.
so
there's
no
question
that
there's
a
rap
market
and
that
they
exploited
it
and
that
that
injures
us.
that
injures
a
potential
market
that
we
have.
the
standard--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--no.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
no,
if
you
define
original
work
as
the
original
roy
orbison
recording.
the
original--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--and
all
it's...
if
you
look
at
all
of
its
derivatives--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--you
look
at
the
market.
in
this
case
you
look
at
the
market
for
rap.
and
i'm
prepared
to
look
at
that
market
for
rap
because
they've
made
a
case.
they,
themselves,
have
made
the
case
that
there
is
a
rap
market
for
a
rap
version
of
our
rock
and
roll
classic.
we
have
in
the
record
on
page...
on
page
326(a)
and
327(a),
evidence
of
the
interest
of
a
rap
group
called
the
brothers
make
3
in
making
a
rap
version
of
our
song
and
fusing
our
music.
and
then
the
literature
it
replete
with
evidence
that
this
is
a
classic
way
in
which
rap
music
is
given
a
mainstream
appeal.
so
there
is
a
rap
market.
and
then...
then
you
have
to
ask
yourself
what's
the
evidence
of
any
potential
injury?
now,
they
had
the
burden
of
proof
here.
they
did
not
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
they
put
in
two
affidavits
rule
56(e)
required
them
to
put
in
an
affidavit
containing
facts,
not
conclusions.
we
talk
about
this
in
our
brief,
but
i'll
briefly
state
this.
you
can't
put
in
an
expert's
affidavit
and
say
that
the
expert's
affidavit
amounts
to
a
fact
because
the
expert
makes
a
conclusion.
i
thought
i
would
read
to
you
very
briefly
from
the
statement
by...
give
me
a
moment...
well,
i
have
misplaced
it.
there's
a
statement
by...
ah,
here
it
is.
there's
a
statement
by
justice...
judge
easterbrook
talking
about
the
requirements
of
rule
56(e)
for
expert
affidavits.
and
he
points
out
that
the
affidavit
must
do
more
than
present
something
that
would
be
admissable.
they
shall,
quote,
set
forth
facts,
and
by
implication
in
the
case
of
experts
who
are
not
fact
witnesses,
a
process
of
reasoning
beginning
from
a
firm
foundation.
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
an
expert
who
supplies
nothing
but
a
bottom
line
supplies
nothing
of
value
to
the
judicial
process.
now
there...
that
comes
from
mid-state
fertilizer
v.
exchange
national
bank,
877
fed
2nd,
1333,
at
page
1339.
now,
that...
that
is
exactly
what
you'll
find
when
you
look
at
oscar
brand's
and
krasilovsky's
affidavit.
they
talk
about
this
having
different
audiences.
first
of
all,
they're
obviously
talking
about
the
roy
orbison
recording,
which
mr.
brand
strangely
calls
a
country
music
record.
fortunately,
petitioners,
who
are
savvy
music
people,
themselves
in
their
brief
at
page
34
and
36
recognize
that
the
orbison
work
is
a
classic
rock
and
roll
work.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
well,
he
applied
the
wrong
standard.
he
did...
he
did
two
things,
your
honor.
one,
he
mistakenly
accepted
these
conclusory
affidavits
as
56(e)
affidavits.
they
were
not.
and
so
he
started
from
the
position
that
there
were
different
audiences
and
he
was
wrong.
and
then
he
said
that
2
live
crew...
i
mean
that
my
client
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
they
were
actually
prevented.
now,
this
court
made
it
clear
in
sony,
and
it
made
it
clear
again...
it
made
it
clear
in
sony
when
it
set
out
the
standards
of
proof.
it
said
in
the
case...
on
economic
harm,
in
a
case
where
you
have
commercial
use...
and
here
you
have
commercial
use
in
spades.
in
a
case
where
you
have--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--yes,
some
commercial
uses
can
be
fair
uses.
but--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--no,
you
should
affirm
the
judgment.
you
could
affirm
the
judgment.
and
if
the
law
and
the
facts
support
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit,
which
we
maintain
they
do,
then
under
united
states
v.
new
york
telephone
and
other
cases
this
court
has
decided,
you
can
firm
the
affirm
the
judgment.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
can
i
come
back
to
this
commercial
use
now,
then.
first
of
all,
i
think
there
is
a
situation
where
commercial
use
may
actually
sweep
the
boards
on
all
of
the
factors.
in
this
case,
we
showed
not
just
that
they
made
a
profit
from
the
parody,
but
that
when
you
take
the
amount
they
used
it;
the
way
they
displayed
it;
how
they
played
this
music
not
just
a
background
to
the
singing
of
the
lyrics,
but
in
wonderful
virtuosity
and
displays
and
dazzling
displays
in
the
middle
and
at
the
end;
that
they
were
selling
this
music.
it
reflected
also
in
how
they
marketed
it.
now,
in
that
circumstance,
i
believe
that
the...
that
it
is
not
a
fair
use.
that
is
the
fair
use
exception
was
never
intended
to
reward
someone--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
it
changed
it--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--it
changed
it
but
it...
it
effected...
it
created
a
record
which
would
compete
with
any
rap
version
we
would
create.
it
changed
it--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--probably.
i'd
have
to
listen
to
it.
but
it
could
be
that
another...
that
there
could
be
a
rap
compulsory
license
version
of
our
song.
i'd
have
to
hear
the
song.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
well,
it
could
be
parody.
but,
you
know,
rap
has
many
messages.
rap
has...
rap
has
humor.
it
has
acerbic...
it
has
an
acerbic
criticism
of
society.
according
to
the
record,
2
live
crew
has
a
message--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--yes.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
let
me
tell
you...
let
me
tell
you
why
i
think--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--yes,
yes,
because
the--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--yes.
and
the
statute
talks
about
an
arrangement
that
changes
the
fundamental
character
of
the
work,
and
work
is
defined
in
the
statute
under
section
101
as
the
music
and
the
words.
so
if
they
change
either
fundamentally...
they
plainly
change
the
words.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
yes.
and
changing--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--no,
no.
[laughter]
let
me...
i
have
a
moment,
i
see.
let
me
just
quickly
run
to
the
procedural
issue.
they're
not
entitled
to
summary
judgment.
all
they
do
is
say
it's
fair
use,
that
it's
a
parody.
they
say
it's
a
parody.
we'll
accept
that
it's
a
parody.
they
don't
get
into
the
commercial
issue
as
we
have
done,
and
they
don't
properly
look
at
the
proper
market.
they
put
in
an
affidavit
which
doesn't
meet
these
standards
of
rule
56(e).
it's
irrelevant
in
any
event
because
it
doesn't
address
derivative
works,
so
it's
worthless.
and
then
the
question
is
do
we...
are
we
entitled
to
summary
judgment.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
we
didn't
ask
for
it,
no.
but
the...
the
judge,
relying
on
the
judge
in
the...
the
judges
in
the
sixth
circuit,
relying
on
harper
&
row,
said
that
they
could
look
at
the
record,
and
if
the
record
was
such
that
it
was
plain
that
the
ultimate
question
here
of
fair
use
was...
could
be
answered
on
undisputed
facts,
then
you
could
grant
summary
judgment,
and
on
that
basis
effectively
granted
summary
judgment.
and
i
think
you
can
do
that
here.
and
why
do
i
say
that?
i
think
this
is...
this
is
probably
the
first
copyright
case
that
can
be
decided
on
the
doctrine
of
res
ipsa
loquitur.
res
ipsa
loquitur
being
the
record
that
they
sold,
the
amount
of
music
that
they
took,
the
way
that
they
marketed
the
song,
which
creates
both
the
notion
that
they
were
exploited
our
copyrighted
song
on
the
one
hand,
and
that
they
were
exploiting
a
market
which
we
had
every
right
to
exploit--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
--to
a
rap
song.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
would
define
parody
as
the...
some
of
the
limiting
cases
do,
that
as
a...
i
would
limit
it
to
parody
that
is
critical
of
the
underlying
work,
because
i
think
that's
a
sensible
limitation.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
it
could
be.
in
fact,
any
change
in
the
lyrics
that's
funny
seems
to
me
to
be
a
parody.
it
makes
ridiculous
the
original
situation.
it
could
be
read
back
to
criticize
the
original
because
if
it's
funny
it's
mocking
it,
poking
fun
at
it,
and
therefore
it
would
be
a
parody
and
it
would
be
fair
use
and
they
could
profit
by
it.
thank
you,
your
honors.
