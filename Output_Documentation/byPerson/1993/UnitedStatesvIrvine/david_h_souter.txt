justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question
there?
you
said,
regardless
of
whether
a
tax
was
imposed,
but
that
isn't
the
verb
tense
used
in
the
reg,
is
it?
the
verb
tense
used...
the
reg
uses
the
present
tense.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
said
was.
in
any
case,
your
brief
on
page
26,
second
line
from
the
bottom
of
the
text,
quotes
the
phrase,
"was
not
subject
to
the
gift
tax.
"
and
you
then
cite
the
reg
2511,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
reg
says.
it
makes
it...
i
understand
it
makes
it
easy
for
your
case
if
you
use
the
past
tense,
but
that's
not
what
the
reg
uses.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
language
came
out
of
ordway,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
still...
do
you
take
the
position
here
that
the
disclaimer
had
to
be
made
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
gift
tax?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
for
the
disclaimer
to
be
effective
to
avoid
the
tax
on
this
transfer,
mrs....
whatever
her
name
was's
transfer,
do
you
take
the
position
that
she
was
required
to
make
that
disclaimer
prior
to
1932?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
the
position
that
the
irs
took
below,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
agree
that
if
she
had
done
it
within
a
reasonable
time
of
reaching
her
majority--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
that
would
have
sufficed?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can
concede
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
we'll
argue--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
argument
that's
being
made
is
that
the
disclaimer
in
effect
precludes
her
acceptance
of
the
gift
in
the
first
place,
and
if
the
reason
she
wants
to
preclude
the
acceptance
is
to
avoid
the
gift
tax,
then
it
would
be
sort
of
unreasonable
to
say
that
she
was
required
to
make
that
act
of
refusal
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
tax
which
she's
trying
to
avoid.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
when
the
reasonable
time
would
come,
your
position
would
be
the
same
whether
the
reg...
what
is
it,
2511...
applies
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
even
if
it
doesn't
cover...
even
if
we
don't
look
to
the
reg
for
analogy,
we're
still
dealing
with
a
gift,
a
gift
implies
an
acceptance,
and
if
there's
no
renunciation
within
some
reasonable
period
of
time
of
an
intent
to
transfer,
there's
still
a
completed
gift,
and
if
she
later
renounces,
she's
still
giving
something
away.
that
would
be
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
help
me
out
on
that,
will
you,
and
i
should
know
this,
but
i'm
not
sure.
was
the
point
being
made
when
the
effectiveness...
when
the
crucial
role
of
state
law
was
being
discussed
the
point
of
effectiveness
as
between
the
donor
and
the
donee
of
the
disclaimer,
or
was
the
point
being
made
the
effectiveness
for
purposes
of
tax
avoidance?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is,
of
course,
ultimately
a
federal
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
you'd
be
on
the
same
footing
with
jewett,
i
suppose,
if
we
took
the
position
that
her
right
to
disclaim
within
a
reasonable
time
was
a
right
to
do
so
within
a
reasonable
time
either
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute
or
of
her
attainment
of
majority.
that
would
bring
you
within
jewett,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
say,
if
we
took
the
position
that
she
had
a
reasonable...
that
she
had
a
right
to
disclaim
within
a
reasonable
time,
and
that
that
time
would
be
calculated
either
from
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
gift
tax
statute
or
from
the
date
she
attained
her
majority,
that
would
put
you
in
the
same
boat
as
the
taxpayer
in
jewett,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
if
we
take
the
position...
i
guess
you
can
have
two
arguments
here,
and
i
was
assuming
you
were
making
one
and
maybe
you're
making
the
other
one.
you
could
be
making
the
argument
that
this
entire
scheme
of
disclaimer
cannot
apply
to
your
trust
because
your
trust
was
created
prior
the
enactment
of
the
gift
tax
and
therefore
nothing
that
relates
to
the
gift
tax
applies
to
your
trust
because
of
the
time
it
was
created,
or
you
could
be
arguing
that
the
crucial
point
in
jewett
was
that
there
was
an
opportunity,
after
the
enactment
of
the
gift
tax,
to
make
the
disclaimer,
which
precluded
the
property
from
vesting
in
the
taxpayer
and
hence
precluded
the
making
of
a
gift
at
the
time
of
the
disclaimer.
i
thought
you
were
making
the
second
argument.
maybe
you're
making
the
first
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
if
you're
making
both
arguments...
if
you're
making
both
arguments,
then
with
respect
to
the
second
one,
you
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
the
jewett
taxpayer,
would
you
not,
if
we
held
that
the
effective
disclaimer
by
the
taxpayer
could
have
been
made
within
a
reasonable
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
gift
tax
statute
or
within
a
reasonable
time
of
her
attainment
of
majority?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
saying
that
reasonable
time
is
to
be
determined
with
respect
to
the
point
of
the
disclaimer,
and
if
the
point
of
the
disclaimer
is
tax
planning,
then
reasonable
time
certainly
couldn't
start
running
before
there
was
any
tax.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
suppose
there's
no
largesse
involved,
unless
we
assume
that
the
commissioner
could
redefine
the
very
concept
of
gift
in
a
way
which
certainly
is
not
suggested
by
any
act
of
congress.
