mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1917,
lucius
ordway
formed
a
trust
with
substantial
assets.
each
of
his
grandchildren,
including
sally
ordway
irvine,
was
given
a
remainder
interest
in
the
trust.
by
1931,
when
mrs.
irvine
was
21
years
old,
she
was
aware
of
her
remainder
interest.
in
1966,
when
her
father
died,
she
became
entitled
to
receive
and
did
receive
each
year
a
portion
of
the
income
from
the
trust.
in
1979,
when
the
trust
terminated,
mrs.
irvine
was
entitled
to
receive
one-thirteenth
of
the
corpus
of
the
trust,
which
then
exceeded
$1/2
billion
in
value.
mrs.
irvine
at
that
time
was
68
years
old
and
had
five
adult
children.
she
determined
that
she
did
not
need
her
entire
share
of
this
enormous
fortune,
and
filed
a
written
disclaimer
of
a
portion
of
her
interest
in
the
trust.
under
the
disclaimer,
each
of
her
children
received
one-sixteenth
of
her
interest
in
the
trust.
mrs.
irvine
retained
the
remaining
eleven
sixteenths
of
her
interest
for
herself.
the
federal
gift
tax
supplements
the
estate
tax
by
imposing
a
tax
on
any
direct
and
indirect
transfer
of
property
by
gift.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
mrs.
irvine's
1979
disclaimer
of
five-sixteenths
of
her
interest
in
the
trust
represents
a
gratuitous
transfer
of
property
to
which
the
gift
tax
applies.
many
of
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
have
already
been
resolved
by
the
court.
since
1943,
in
smith
v.
shaughnessy,
it
has
been
established
that
a
remainder
interest
in
a
trust
is
a
form
of
property,
to
which
the
gift
tax
applies,
and
the
fact
that
the
remainder
interest
is
subject
to
defeasance
goes
only
to
the
value
of
that
interest
and
not
to
its
character
as
property.
the
only
other
question
posed
by
the
statute
is
whether
the
disclaimer
of
such
an
interest
in
property
represents
a
transfer
of
that
property
for
purposes
of
the
gift
tax,
and
in
1982,
in
jewett
v.
commissioner,
this
court
held
that
it
does.
the
court
accepted
the
interpretation
of
the
commissioner
that
a
disclaimer
that
is
not
made
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
taxpayer
learns
of
his
interest
in
the
property
is
an
indirect
transfer
of
property
to
which
the
gift
tax
applies.
the
court
explained
that
the
passage
of
time
is
crucial
to
the
gift
tax
scheme.
with
the
passage
of
time,
the
taxpayer
can
decide
whether
to
retain
the
property
for
himself
or
allow
it
to
pass
to
the
next
generation.
the
analysis
of
the
court
in
jewett
obviously
applies
directly
to
mrs.
irvine's
long-delayed
disclaimer
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
however,
that
the
gift
tax
does
not
apply
to
this
1979
disclaimer
solely
because
the
interest
that
was
disclaimed
was
created
in
1917,
before
the
gift
tax
was
enacted.
the
court's
analysis
ultimately
rests
upon
its
acceptance
of
a
legal
fiction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
what
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
section
of
the
code
that
is
relevant
would
be
section
2511,
but
i
think
that
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
in
the
enactment
of
the
federal
gift
tax
there
was
a
provision
that
says
that
this
statute
will
not
apply
to
any
transfer
prior
to
the
date
of
enactment,
and
so
it
was
that
retroactive...
it
was
that
feature
of
the
statute
that
the
court
had
in
mind.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that
was
a
different
portion
of
the
court's
rationale
that
i
haven't
yet
discussed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
at
this
point,
what
i'm
pointing
out
is
that
the
court's
analysis
ultimately
rests
upon
its
acceptance
of
a
legal
fiction
about
disclaimers.
under
state
law,
a
valid
disclaimer
is
treated
as
if
it
were
made
ab
initio,
at
the
same
time
that
the
initial
transfer
was
made,
and
that
state
legal
fiction
is
designed
to
protect
the
property
from
the
intervening
claims
of
creditors
and
other
third
parties,
but
in
jewett
the
court
explained
that
those
state
law
concerns
do
not
control
application
of
the
federal
gift
tax,
and
that's
because
the
state
legal
fiction
is
counterfactual.
it
is
only
a
fiction
and
not
a
fact
that
a
long-delayed
disclaimer
is
made
ab
initio.
in
this
case,
for
example,
mrs.
irvine's
disclaimer
was
made
62
years
after
the
trust
was
formed
and
a
full
half-century
after
she
reached
her
age
of
majority.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
correct.
under
state
law
principles,
the
state
deems
the
disclaimer
to
have
been
made
ab
initio.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
to
the
contrary,
the
court
held
in
jewett
that
a
disclaimer
represents
an
indirect
transfer
and
then
looked
to
the
regulation
to
determine
the
limitations
on
that
analysis
that
the
secretary
had
reached
in
issuing
the
interpretive
regulation
that
was
in
effect
at
that
time.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
jewett
and
jacobs,
read
together,
answer
all
the
questions
in
this
case.
jewett
answers
the
question
of
whether
this
is
an
indirect
transfer
of
property
by
gift.
jacobs
and
estate
of
sanford
answer
the
question
of
whether
this
gift
tax
is
applied
retroactively
when
it's
applied
to
a
transfer
that
occurs
after
the
date
of
enactment
but
with
respect
to
an
interest
that
was
created
before
the
date
of
enactment,
and
what
the
court
squarely
held
in
jacobs
and
estate
of
sanford
is
that
the
gift
tax
retroactivity...
nonretroactivity
requirement
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
tax
that's
imposed
on
a
transfer
that
occurs
after
enactment.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
transfer
that
is
subject
to
tax
in
this
case
occurred
in
1979,
when
mrs.
irvine
made
a
disclaimer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
within
the
specific
words
of
the
regulation,
the
taxable
transfer
referred
to
in
the
regulation
is
the
initial,
completed
gift.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
would
have
been
in
1917,
with
the
gift
in
trust.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
not
necessary
for
our
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
not
really.
i
guess
to
answer
that
question
you
really
have
to
start
from
the
beginning
of
describing
what
the
'86
regulation
does
and
what
it
says.
the
'86
regulation
was
made
necessary
by
the
enactment
of
2518
of
the
code,
which
established
a
fixed
9-month
period
for
tax-free
disclaimers
of
interest
created
after
1976.
in
adopting
the
regulations
in
1986,
under...
to
implement
the
old
and
the
new
statutory
provisions,
the
'86
treasury
gift
tax
regulations
used
the
term,
taxable
transfer,
to
describe
the
initial
completed
gift.
now,
we
know
that
because
the
regs
specifically
cross-reference
to
the
contemporaneous
regulations
adopted
under
2518.
those
regulations
contain
a
definition
of
the
term
taxable
transfer
for
the
purpose
of
the
regulations,
and
that
definition
is
a
completed
gift
regardless
of
whether
a
tax
was
imposed.
now,
this--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
thought
i...
well,
i
thought
i
said
regardless
of
whether
a
tax
is
imposed,
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we...
respondents
properly
took
us
to
task
for
having
a
citation
mistake
at
that
page
of
our
brief,
and
we
discussed
that
citation
mistake
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
the
ibid...
what
should
have
been
on
page
26
was
an
ibid,
and
the
simple
explanation
is
that
the
cite
checkers
in
our
office
don't
accept
an
ibid
at
the
beginning
of
a
paragraph,
and
so
when
they
struck
out
the
ibid,
they
looked
to
the
last
thing
in
the
prior
quote.
the
last
thing
in
the
prior
quote
was
the
reg
that
was
cited
in
ordway.
the
proper
citation
is
simply
to
the
ordway
opinion
again.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
there
are
two
relevant
transfers.
the
initial
transfer
is
described
as
the
taxable
transfer
in
the
regulation.
it
is
defined
in
the
regulation
to
simply
mean,
a
completed
gift
without
regard
to
whether
a
tax
is
imposed.
it
is
simply
a
clock-starting
mechanism.
the
phrase
is
awkward,
and
but
for
the
definition
in
the
cross-section
it
would
be
confusing,
but
with
the
cross-reference
it's
not
confusing.
it
simply
says
you
start
the
clock
running
from
the
date
of
the
initial
completed
gift.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
was
in
1917,
and
we
know...
the
phrase,
completed
gift,
comes
out
of
this
court's
decisions
in
burnet
v.
guggenheim
and
cases
of
that
type,
and
what
it...
the
completed
gift
is
a
gift
made
when
the
donor
has
parted
with
all
control
and
dominion
over
the
property,
which
mr.
ordway
did
in
1917.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
to
be
subject
to
tax,
the
disclaimer
would
have
to
be
made
after
the
date
of
the
gift
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
all
likelihood,
we
would
take
that
position
if
the
issue
had
arisen,
but
i
want
to
amplify
that
in
two
ways.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
was
an
answer
to
a
hypothetical
question.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
it
really
has
no
relevance
to
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
we
don't
have
to
answer
that
question
here,
because
here
we
have
a
full
half
century
that
passed
between
the
time
she
reached
her
age
of
majority
and
the
time
that
she
disclaimed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
she
reached
her
majority...
actually,
the
record's
a
little
bit
mixed
on
this
and
apparently
in
minnesota
the
age
of
majority
was
18
so
she
actually
reached
her
age
of
majority
in
1928
but
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
and
with
respect
to
your
point--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
have
any
views
on
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
there
isn't
anything
odd--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
accept
that
fully.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
leave
that
to
you.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
really
don't
have
an
opinion
on
that
at
this
time,
but
i
wanted
to
point
out
in
response
to
justice
souter
that
there's
nothing
odd
about
saying
that
for
her
to
make
a
tax-free
disclaimer
it
might
have
been
necessary
to
do
it
before
the
gift
tax
was
enacted.
for
anyone
to
make
a
tax-free
gift,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
do
it
before
the
gift
tax
was
enacted.
that's
equally
true
whether
the
gift
was
made
by
disclaimer
or
by
outright
grant,
so
there's
nothing
odd
or
unfair
about
suggesting
that
if
she
wanted
to
make
a
tax-free
disclaimer,
it
should
have
been
done
before
the
gift
tax--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
have
been
no
cases
that
have
really
been
at
the
border
that
test
the...
how
you
decide
what
a
reasonable
time
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
might
be
a
different
case,
but
i
doubt
that
we
would
take
that
position.
we
think
that
the
reasonable
time
describes
one
of
two
things,
and
you
can
look
at
it
either
the
way
the
dissent
or
the
majority
did
in
jewett.
the
reasonable
time
either
reflects
a
passage
of
time
that
allows
the
disclaimer
to
work
in
an
estate
planning
function,
which
is
clearly
what
we
have
in
this
case.
another
way
to
look
at
the
passage
of
time
is
the
way
the
1986
regulations
describe
their
interpretive
rationale,
and
that
is
that
property
cannot
be
disclaimed
free
of
tax
after
it
is
accepted,
and
that
property
is
deemed
to
be
accepted
when
it
has
been
retained
without
disclaimer
for
more
than
a
reasonable
time.
either
of
those
rationales
is
really
satis...
is
sufficient
under
the
jewett
decision
and
under
the
interpretive
regulations.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
absolutely
correct,
because
there's
no...
the
gift
tax
doesn't
apply
only
when
it's
a
substitute
for
estate
planning.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
as
long
as--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--as
long--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
is
the
analysis
of
the
regulations
which
seems
appropriate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
absolutely,
and
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
point.
this
is
simply
an
interpretive
regulation.
if...
it
does
not
purport
to
be
a
complete
codification
of
every
conceivable
application
of
the
statute.
it
sets
forth
an
interpretive
rationale
that
guides
application
of
the
statute,
and
whether
or
not
one
were
to
think
that
this
specific
transaction
fell
squarely
within
the
language
of
the
regulation,
the
rationale
of
the
regulation
is
still
a
suitable
guide
for
this
court.
because,
ultimately,
whether
the
tax
is
imposed
or
not
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
and
the
interpretive
guide
that
this
regulation
contains
for
any
situation
involving
disclaimers
is
the
one
that
we've
discussed,
which
is
that
a
disclaimer
not
made
within
a
reasonable
time
represents
an
indirect
transfer
of
property.
the
other
way
to
reach...
to
make
somewhat
the
same
point
is
that
the
interpretive
regulation
describes
an
exception
from
the
gift
tax,
that
the
gift
tax
applies
unless
a
disclaimer
is
made
within
a
reasonable
time,
and
that
if
a
tax
exception
does
not
apply,
then
the
tax
does.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
1986
treasury
gift
tax
regulations
in
26
c.f.r.
2511-1(c).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
those
are
quoted
in
full,
both
the
'58
and
'86
versions
are
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
in
full.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
one
of
the
pages.
i
think
they
might
begin
on
59.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir.
i
have
referred
to
some
of
the
specific
sentences,
but
the...
under
the
'86
regulation
at
page
62-a,
down
towards
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
interpretive
regulation
states,
"a
refusal
to
accept
ownership
does
not
constitute
the
making
of
a
gift
if
the
refusal
is
made
within
a
reasonable
time
after
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
transfer.
"
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
the
definition
of
the
phrase,
taxable
transfer,
is
contained
in
the
cross-reference
provisions
of
section
2518
of
the
regulations,
and
those,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
are
quoted
at
the
beginning
of
our
merits
brief
on
page
2,
where
it
says,
"with
respect
to
inter
vivos
transfers
a
taxable
transfer
occurs
when
there
is
a
completed
gift
for
federal
gift
tax
purposes
regardless
of
whether
a
gift
tax
is
imposed
on
the
completed
gift.
"
and
again,
a
completed
gift
for
federal
gift
tax
purposes
is
the
one
described
by
this
court
in
burnet
v.
guggenheim,
where
the
transferor
has
parted
with
complete
dominion
over
the
property.
that
was
mr.
ordway's
gift
in
trust
in
1917.
i
want
to
emphasize
simply,
we
are
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
isn't
the
most
felicitous
phrasing...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
is...
but
it
is
phrasing
that
has
been
clearly
articulated
in
the
regulation
to
have
this
specific
meaning,
and
i
think
there's
a
historical
explanation
for
why
they
used
this
perhaps
awkward
term.
it
relates
to
the
fact
that
the
1976...
post
1976
transfers
under
section
2518,
the
initial
starting
date
was
referred
to
in
some
of
the
legislative
materials
as
the
original
taxable
transfer,
and
when
they
coordinated
these
regulations
in
'86,
they
picked
up
that
same
terminology,
but
it
has
no...
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
give
it
great
weight,
you
cannot
read
the
contemporaneous
cross-references
in
the
regulations
and
be
confused.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
for
two
reasons,
she
would
still...
the
transfer
would
be
subject
to
tax.
if
she
doesn't
come
within
the
exception
for
disclaimers
made
within
a
reasonable
time,
then
she
has
no
exception
to
rely
on,
and
she's
taxable
under
the
general
rule
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
the
regulation,
but
more
importantly,
this
is
an
interpretive
regulation,
it
is
not
a
substantive
one.
it
doesn't
necessarily
try
to
cover
every
conceivable
situation.
justice
stevens'
opinion
for
the
court
in
jewett
goes
through
the
history
of
this
regulation,
and
points
out
that
in
its
original
1958
form,
it
was
written
in
a
broader
manner
that
by
its
terms
would
have
covered
inter
vivos,
testamentary,
and
every
type
of
transfer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that's
the
right
number,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
what
i
mean
to
say
in
connection
with
that
is
that
the
history
of
the
regulations
as
adopted
leaves
it
clear
that
the
terms
were
used
in
the
same
manner
in
both--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--sets
of
regulations.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
2518
it
defines
it
for
purposes
of
2518.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
the
same--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--most
of
it
does.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
all
of
it
except
the
date.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
covers
it
to
the
extent
of
this
case
here.
it's
just
that
the
definition
in
2518
relates
to
the
context
of
2518,
which
is
post-'76
transfers.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
our
argument,
and
the
facts
of
this
case
are
really,
i
mean,
perhaps
one
of
the
strongest
settings
in
which
this
issue
could
arise.
we
have
a
transfer
of
a
contingent
interest
in
an
enormously
valuable
property
that
was
made
after
the
transferor
had
held
the
interest
for
more
than
50
years.
she
did
it
when
she
was
68.
the
property
passed
to
the
natural
objects
of
her
bounty.
all
of
the
economic
realities
of
this
case
indicate
that
this
was
an
indirect
transfer
of
property
by
gift,
to
which
the
statute
applies.
i
would
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
with
respect
to
the
1966
letter
ruling
that
was
just
referred
to,
we've
discussed
this
in
our
brief.
i
just
want
to
emphasize
again
that
it
was
the
commissioner's
interpretation
in
that
case
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
knowledge,
or
should
not
be
attributed
to
have
knowledge
of
that
interest
until
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
after
somewhat
lengthy
litigation,
determined
that
the
adopted
children
could
not
succeed
to
the
interests
of
the
other
affected
interest.
what
is
absolutely
clear
about
that
ruling
is
that
that
was
the
commissioner's
interpretation,
so
in
stating
his
interpretation
he
was
plainly
being
consistent
with
the
analysis
of
the
regulation,
which
is
that
a
taxpayer
has
a
reasonable
time
to
disclaim
after
the
taxpayer
becomes
aware
of
the
interest.
in
brief,
a
person
who
transfers
property
by
gift
is
subject
to
tax.
in
estate
of
sanford,
in
1939,
chief
justice
stone
held
for
the
court
that
the
federal
gift
tax
looks
to
the
economic
realities
of
the
transfer
of
control.
justice
cardozo
said
exactly
the
same
thing
for
the
court
in
1933
in
burnet
v.
guggenheim.
this
court's
decision
in
jewett
is
an
amplification
of
that
simple
principal,
and
as
i've
already
described,
it
is
not
subject
to
argument
here
that
the
economic
realities
in
this
case
reflect
a
lengthy
control
over
the
property
by
mrs.
irvine
and
an
enjoyment
of
the
income
interest,
and
an
ultimate
transfer
of
that
property
to
her
children.
therefore,
the
gift
tax
applies.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you're
saying
a
disclaimer
made
within
a
reasonable
time.
i
believe
that
the
commissioner's
view
of
a
disclaimer
made
within
a
reasonable
time
is
that
if
a
tax
is
imposed
on
that
transfer,
then
it
requires
the
taxpayer
to
accept
the
gift,
and
the
commissioner
doesn't
want
to
impose
that
requirement.
the
commissioner
allows
the
gift
to
be
disclaimed
within
a
reasonable
time,
but
if
it
occur...
if
more
than
a
reasonable
time
passes--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
that
what
the
commissioner
is
attempting
to
do
is
not
to
give
away
the
government's
money
but
to
come
up
with
a
sensible
approach
to
this
scheme.
congress
ultimately
adopted
a
similar,
even
though
more
objective
rationale.
they
give
the
taxpayer
9
months
to
disclaim.
i
think
that
the
legislation
ultimately
enacted
under
2518
reflects
that
the
commissioner's
interpretation
of
the
proper
application
of
this
statute
was
sensible
and
correct,
and
certainly
the
court
upheld
it
in
jewett.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
believe
it
also
reflects
that
it
was
sensible
and
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
what's
really
at
issue
here
is,
when
was
the
property
transferred?
there's
no
question
that
it
was
a
gratuitous
transfer.
the
disclaimer
is
an
indirect
transfer,
and
that
was
really
the
event
that
the
commissioner's
regulation
focused
on,
and
this
court's
decision
in
jewett
did.
thank
you.
