justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
an
academic
question,
because
in
fact
she
did
not
disclaim
after
the
gift
tax
came
into
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
don't
have
to
answer
the
question
whether,
and
suppose
she
had
done
it
in
1933
or
1934,
because
she
didn't
do
it
till
'79.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
possibly
it
was
unconstitutional
not
to
give
her
the
extra
3
years.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there's
a
decision
of
this
court...
stanton,
i
think
v.
utah...
that
suggests
that
the
differential
in
age
of
majority
might
be
unconstitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
concede
that
if
she
did
it
a
reasonable
time
from
the
effective
date
of
the
gift
tax,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
position
is
it
shouldn't
be
a
decision
driven
by
tax
consequences,
that
what
you're
looking
to
see
is
if
this
person
was...
exercised
control,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
contending--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
it
didn't
have
value
because
it
was
continent...
could
have
been
valued?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
she
had
something
that
she
was
capable
of
conveying
or
relinquishing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
don't
exercise
that
right
until
decades
later,
then
aren't
you
holding
the
control
rein
in
the
interim,
as
you
would
not
if
you
relinquished
control
within...
if
you
said,
no
i
don't
want
it,
within
a
reasonable
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
at
all
unusual
that
you
have
one
set
of
consequences
for
state
law
purposes,
a
transaction
is
regarded
as
one
way,
this
is
retroactive
for
state
law
purposes
so
creditors
can't
reach
it,
and
a
different
result
for
federal
income
tax
purposes.
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--quite
common.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
applied
when--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
no...
nothing
retroactive
to
the
original
donor?
there's
an
action
taken
long
after
the
gift
tax
is
in
effect,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
a
1979
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
indication
in
this
record
why
it
was
five-sixteenths?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
mr.
jones
said
it
was
an
academic
question.
he
acknowledged
it
would
be
a
different
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
court
could
take
the
position,
could
it
not,
that
even
if
there
had
to
be...
if
the
reasonable
time
had
to
run
from
the
date
the
gift
tax
took
effect,
even
if
that
were
so,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
because
here
the
disclaimer
came
over
40
years
later.
