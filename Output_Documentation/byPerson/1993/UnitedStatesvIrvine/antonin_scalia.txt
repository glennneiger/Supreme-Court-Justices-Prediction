alternatively,
it
might
be
unconstitutional
to
give
the
men
3
more
years.
i
mean,
one
or
the
other
is
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
can
be
driven
by
tax
purposes.
i
can
decide
not
to
accept
the
gift
simply
because
it
will
cost
more
in
taxes
if
i
accept
it
and
then
give
it
to
my
children
than
if
i
let
it
go
to
my
children
directly,
and
so
long
as
i
don't
accept
it,
it
can
be
driven
as
much
as
i
like
by
tax
consequences,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
just
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
shouldn't
accept
it
first,
and
you
accept
it
automatically
if
too
much
time
passes.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
jones,
you're
relying
on
the
definition
of
taxable
transfer
contained
in
2518-2(c)(3).
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
don't...
you
do
not
assert
that
2518-2(c)(3)
defines
the
meaning
of
taxable
transfer
in
2511?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
you're
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
can
assume
that
it
has
the
same
meaning,
although
that
definition
doesn't
technically
cover
2511?
justice
antonin
scalia
most
of
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not
cover
it
to
the
extent
that
this
case
here
is
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
not
whether
they
intended
to
be
retroactive
in
1932,
but
rather
whether
they
intended,
in
1932,
to
have
state
law
govern
at
all
for
the
purposes
of
whether
there
is
a
subsequent
transfer,
a
subsequent
gift.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
did
not
intend
state
law
to
govern
at
all
when
they
enacted
it
in
1932,
then
there's
nothing
retroactive,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
jewett
said
it
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
an
effective
disclaimer
doesn't
exercise
effective
control
over
the
property
anyway.
why
don't
you
go
whole
hog
and
say,
even
a
disclaimer
amounts
to
a
gift?
that
exercises
control
over
the
property,
doesn't
it?
it
says,
it
doesn't
come
to
me,
it
goes
to
him,
even
if
you
exercise
it
promptly.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
congress
agree
with
it
if
it
was
wrong?
