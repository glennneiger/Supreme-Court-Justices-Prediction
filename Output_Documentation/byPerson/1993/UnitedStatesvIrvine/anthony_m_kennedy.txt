in
your
view,
when
did
the
taxable
transfer
take
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
did
the
taxable
transfer
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
take
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that's
1917?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
it
necessary
for
your
case
to
say
that
the
1917
creation
of
the
trust
was
a
taxable
transfer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
your
number
1
line
of
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
still
not
sure
when,
in
your
view,
the
taxable
transfer
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
took
place.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
your
view
that
is
1917?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
page
62-a
in
the
petition?
62-a?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
term,
transfer,
refers
to
taxable
transfers,
which
is
the
beginning
phrase
of
that
sentence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
a
little
odd
to
say
a
gift
tax
imposed
or
not
imposed
can
be
meaningfully
applied
in
1917,
when
there
was
no
gift
tax
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
would
happen
if
we
decided
that
this
regulation
was
not
applicable
to
her
because
it
was
not
a
taxable
transfer?
would
she
then
be
outside
the
safe
harbor
provision
and
in
even
worse
condition,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
problem
with
that
definition
is
that
it's...
it
really
only
applies
to
transfers
or
disclaimers
that
are
made
after
1976,
transfers
creating
an
interest
in
the
person
disclaiming
that
are
made
after
1976,
so
technically
that...
i
mean,
you
may
argue
that
it
applies
by
analogy,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
argue
that
it
applies
strictly
speaking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
did
she
first
become
entitled
to
receive
the
income,
at
what
age?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
1966.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
does
that
leave
us
as
to
the
governing
principle
in
this
case?
