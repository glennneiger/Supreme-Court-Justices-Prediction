justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
martin,
on
the
timing,
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
assume
that
her
rights
had
vested
in
1957.
say
the
death
had
come
a
little
earlier...
in
other
words,
before
the
regulation
was
adopted.
would
you
prevail,
if,
say,
she
had
immediately
renounced
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
also
jewett
had
been
decided
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it's
correct.
i
know
you
disagree
with
it--
[laughter]
but
if
jewett
was
on
the
books
then,
would
she
have
any
basis
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--avoiding
the
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
really...
this
is
a
question
of
whether
jewett
is
retroactive
or
not,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
basic
position--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
basic
position
is
inconsistent
with
jewett,
and
maybe
jewett's
wrong.
i
have
to
acknowledge
that
there's
good
arguments
on
both
sides,
but
don't
you
really
have
to
say
that
jewett
should
not
apply
to
preregulation
transfers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
an
intermediate
position,
mr.
martin,
that...
she
began
to
get
income
in
1966,
as
i
remember
the
facts--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
her
father
died,
and
she...
and
substantial
income.
had
she
disclaimed
immediately
after
becoming
an
income
beneficiary,
perhaps
your
case
would
be
much...
much
more
attractive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
know
the
government
doesn't
take
that
position
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
martin,
you're
dead
right
that
you've
called
our
attention
to
things
that
were
not
before
us
at
the
time
of
jewett.
their
response,
and
i'd
like
you
to
directly
respond
to
their...
their
response,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
in
each
of
the
instances
on
which
you
place
primary
reliance,
there
was
a
prompt
disclaimer
right
after
the
interest
was
disclaimed.
do
you
agree
with
that
appraisal
of
the
various
cases
that
you've
cited?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
justice
scalia
to
be
suggesting
the
commissioner's
giving
away
the
government's
money
when
he
does
that.
