mr.
phillip
h.
martin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
mrs.
irvine
should
have
had
the
foresight
to
disclaim
her
interest,
her
remainder
interest
in
the
ordway
trust
in
1928
when
she
turned
age
18,
which
was
then
the
age
of
majority
in
minnesota
for
her
disclaimer
to
be
free
of
gift
tax.
now,
at
that
time,
her
interest
was
contingent,
it
was
subject
to
her
surviving
the
six
living
life
income
beneficiaries,
and
it
was
dependent
upon
the
number
of
grandchildren
who
would
be
living
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
last--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--of
those
beneficiaries.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
we're
not
contending
that
it
didn't
have
value,
no.
that
is
not
the
issue
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
we're
not
contending
that
it
isn't
property,
either.
i
think
smith
v.
shaughnessy
is
a
red
herring.
we
agree
that
a
contingent
remainder
interest
is
property.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
she
had
something.
what
she
had
under
the
leading
authority
of
brown
v.
routzahn
was
a
right
to
accept
or
a
right
to
reject,
and
she
exercised,
eventually,
her
right
to
reject.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
well,
i
think
the
passage
of
time
is
also
misleading.
you
know,
the
government
has
a
regulation...
in
fact,
it
comes
out
of
the
1932
act
legislative
history...
that
says
that
the
creation
of
a
joint
bank
account
where
a
transferor
transfers
property
to
an
account
and
allows
a
transferee
the
right
to
withdraw,
that
that's
not
a
gift
until
the
transferee
exercises
that
right
to
withdraw,
and
the
transferee
can
wait
as
long
as
he
wants,
and
in
fact
the
regulations
under
section
2518
contain
an
example
authorizing
and
permitting
that
transferee
to
disclaim
within
9
months
after
the
death
of
the
transferor,
so
i
think
that
the
issue
of
passage
of
time
is
not
an
end-all.
the
service
has
indicated
that
that's
not
necessarily
the
case
here.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
1966.
she
was
born
in
1910...
56.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
1966,
yes,
on
the
death
of
her
father.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
i
think
under
the
rule
of
brown
v.
routzahn,
she
definitely...
we
definitely
would
have
prevailed.
that
would
have
been
a
disclaimer
that
was
valid
under
minnesota
law.
under
brown
v.
routzahn,
minnesota
law
was
controlling.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
the--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--well,
yes,
justice
stevens--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--she
would.
i
mean,
the
issue...
really,
the
bottom
line
issue
here
is
what
rule
of
disclaimer
do
we
apply?
do
we
apply
the
rule
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
trust
was
created,
or
do
we
apply
the
rule
that
was
interpreted
by
this
court
in
jewett?
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
it's
a
question
of
whether--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--it's
a
question
of
whether
the
gift
tax
was--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--that's
exactly
what
we
do
say.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
in
jewett...
in
jewett,
they
acknowledge
that
brown
v.
routzahn
not
only
controlled
that
state
law
was
controlling,
but
they
also
said
that
state
law
was
controlling
as
to
the
timeliness.
that
was
specifically
acknowledged
by
the
court
in
jewett.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
the
effectiveness...
as
we
use
the
term
effectiveness
in
our
brief,
we're
talking
about
an
effective
disclaimer
for
tax
purposes,
one
that
is
recognized
by
the
tax
law
as
being
a
refusal
to
accept
property.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
that
is
ultimately
a
federal
question,
and
the
question
is
whether,
when
congress
enacted
the
gift
tax
act
in
1932,
did
they
intend
to
disturb
the
preexisting
rights
under
existing
instruments
such
as
mrs.
irvine
had
under
the
lucius
ordway
trust,
or
did
they
intend
to
apply
a
brand
new
rule
which,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
this
court
interpreted
in
jewett.
it
implied
it
was
a
new
federal
standard,
it
had
a
new
requirement,
it
had
a
new
timeliness
requirement
which
did
not
exist
under
state
law,
under
the
law
that
was
controlling
at
the
time
that
the
gift
tax
act
itself
was
enacted.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
that's--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--that's
right,
it
is
not
unusual,
and
we're
not
saying
that
that's
the
difference
here.
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
when
congress
enacted
the
gift
tax
act
in
1932,
it
did
not
intend
to
apply
that
act
retroactively.
it
did
not
intend--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--to
disturb
the
existing
rules.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
that's
right,
but
the
right
that
mrs.
irvine
took
in
1979
was
based
on
a
right
that
was
existent
back
in...
when
the
trust
was
created.
as
the
court
in
brown
v.
routzahn
held,
she
had
a
right
to
accept
and
a
right
to
reject,
and
that
was
governed
by
state
law,
and
that
was
the
status
of
things
when
congress
enacted
the
gift
tax
act
in
1932.
when
congress
has
enacted
disclaimer
rules,
they
have
always
looked
prospectively.
in
1976,
when
they
enacted
section
2518
here,
they
specifically
provided
that
that
would
not
apply
to
preexisting
interests.
similarly,
in
1981
when
they
amended
it,
they
did
not
retroactively
apply
that
amendment.
it's
interesting
that
counsel
for
the
government,
when
he
argued
this
case
in
jewett,
specifically
said
with
respect
to
why
2518
wasn't
applied
retroactively,
he
said
that
congress
normally
legislates
prospectively
in
the
estate
and
gift
tax
area.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
i
think
the
question--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--well,
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
question,
though,
is
what
they
intended,
and
at
that
time
the
rule
in
brown
v.
routzahn
was
already
being
established,
was...
had
been
decided
in
the
district
court
by
the
time
the
gift
tax
act
was
enacted.
it
became
the
well
established
rule.
the
service
has
implied
it
itself.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
jewett
said
it
was
wrong...
jewett
was
interpreting
the
1958
regulation.
the
1958
regulation
dealt
with
the
transfers
after
the
act.
the
1958
regulation
was
subsequently
replaced
by
the
1986
regulation,
which
says
that
it
does
not
apply
to
taxable
transfers
after
the
act.
now,
incidentally,
there
is
a
no
cross-reference
in
section
111-1(c)(2),
which
is
the
section
we're
focusing
on,
to
section
2518.
there
is
a
cross-reference
in
section
2511-1(c)(1)
to
section
2518,
but
that
makes
sense,
because
that's
post
'77,
and
they're
talking
about
qualified
disclaimers,
but
with
respect
to
taxable
transfers
for
pre-'77
transfers,
there
is
no
cross-reference,
and
so
the
definition
that
the
court...
that
the
government
is
relying
on
in
2518
simply
doesn't
apply.
it
doesn't
apply
for
that
reason,
it
also
doesn't
apply
because
it
is
really
directed
to
the
issue
of
when
the
9-month
period
begins,
and
the
9-month
period
is
only
relevant
with
respect
to
post-'76
transfers.
it
is
not--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--well,
i
think
it
leaves
us
back
with
where
we
were,
where
we
started.
the
rule
of
brown
v.
routzahn,
which
the
government
still
applies...
they
cited
it
in
a
1991
gcm,
described
it,
said
that...
and
interestingly
called
it
the
no-transfer
rule,
and
that's
really
what
we're
saying,
is
that
a
disclaimer
is
not
a
transfer,
it's
a
refusal
to
accept
property.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
there
is
not...
none.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
that.
the...
this
court
in
jewett
did
not
decide
that
all
disclaimers
are
transfers.
the
very
premise
of
the
decision
in
jewett
was
that
a
disclaimer
may
be
an
indirect
transfer.
that's
all
that
the
court
said.
when
the
court
said
that
a
transfer
may
be
unquestionably
encompassed,
that
language
was
really
referring
to
whether
we
have
a
property
interest,
whether
a
contingent
remainder
is
a
property
interest,
and
that
really
is
not
the
issue
here.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
case
is
not
simply
a
replay
of
jewett,
that
in
jewett
the
court
found
it
very
significant
that
the
right,
the
jewetts'
right
to
disclaim
did
not
come
into
existence
until...
that
his
interest
did
not
come
into
existence
until
after
the
gift
tax
act
had
been
enacted.
mrs.
irvine's
right,
on
the
other
hand,
was
in
existence
well
before
the
enactment
of
the
gift
tax,
and
therefore
she
did
have
a
right
to
disclaim.
she
had
a
right
under
local
property
law
to--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--i'm
sorry,
justice
souter,
i
did
not
follow
that.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
the...
well,
i'm
sorry,
i
must
be
missing
something
here.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
well,
actually,
your
honor,
we're
making
both
arguments.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
which
really
is
saying
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
hidden
grace
period
in
the
enactment
of
the
gift
tax
act
to
permit
disclaimers
even
though
the
reasonable
time
had
already
expired.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
but
in
this
case,
the
government
has
conceded,
has
acknowledged
that
under
their
position
of
the
case
her
right
to
disclaim
expired
before
the
enactment
of
the
gift
tax.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
i'm...
i'm
relating
what
the
government
conceded
at
oral
argument
in
the
eighth
circuit,
justice
ginsburg,
but
that's
right,
he
did...
he
did
say
that
it
would
be
academic,
but
i
don't
know
that
it
is
academic,
because
it
points
out
the
problem
with
the
statutory
construction
here,
that
we
have
a
statute
which
would
apply
to--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--well,
it...
but
that's
the
point,
that
she
would
never
have
had
any
notification
that
she
was
expected
to
disclaim
at
the
time
the
gift
tax
was
enacted.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
that's
right.
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
well,
but,
justice
stevens,
the
government
acknowledges
the
fact--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--well,
they
not
only
don't
take
that...
they've
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
acceptance
here.
in
their
regulations
under
section
2518,
they
treat
income
interest
and
principal
interest
as
separate,
and
they
make
it
clear
that
the
acceptance
of
an
income
interest
does
not
prohibit
a
person
from
accepting
a
principal
interest,
and
so
the
fact
that
she
received
income
under
the
government's
own
regulations
is
really
irrelevant.
the
other...
another
point
that
was
brought
up
is
that
the
court,
when
they
decided
jewett,
was
not
aware
that
the
commissioner
had
consistently
taken
the
position
that
brown
v.
routzahn
was
the
proper
rule
and
that
there
was
a...
even
more
materials
than
what
was
available
to
the
court
at
that
time
indicating
that
the
regulation
was
intended
to
codify
brown
v.
routzahn
and
that
the
commissioner's
position
had
not
been
entirely
consistent
in
interpreting
the
disclaimer
regulations,
that
the--
mr.
phillip
h.
martin
--well,
i
don't
think
that
was
true
at
all
in
the
1966
private
letter
ruling,
where
we
had
an
inter
vivos
trust
that
was
created
in
1933.
the
beneficiary
started
receiving
income
in
1936,
and
30
years
later,
in
1966,
her
brothers
died,
and
she
became
entitled
to
an
increased
income
interest.
now,
she
was
aware
of
that
interest
from
the
time
that
she
became
a
beneficiary
of
the
trust.
it
was
a
contingent
interest.
it
was
contingent
upon
whether
her
brothers
had
issue
when
they
died,
and
it
turned
out
that
they...
both
of
them
had
adopted
children,
and
the
court
ultimately
held...
a
state
court...
that
adopted
children
were
not
issue.
as
a
result
of
that
holding,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
that's
what
gave
rise
to
the
increase
in
the
income,
but
that
really
isn't...
that
isn't
any
different
than
if
one
of
those
children
had
died
ahead
of
time,
that
if
it
had
been
a
natural
child
and
had
died
ahead
of
the
brother,
we
still
would
have
had
the
situation
where
there
was
an
increase
in
income.
and
certainly
she
was
aware
of
that
trust
from
the
time
that
she
started
receiving
income,
so
she
was
aware
of
her
interest
for
30
years,
which
is...
which
was
the
gist
of
jewett's
interpretation
of
the
regulation,
and
that
was
a
trust
that
was
established
after
the
act.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
your
honor--
