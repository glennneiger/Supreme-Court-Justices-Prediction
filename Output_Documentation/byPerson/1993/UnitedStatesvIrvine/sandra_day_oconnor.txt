justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
state
law
principles,
it
would
be
treated
as
having
occurred
back
in
1917?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
jewett,
did
this
court
indicate,
the
majority,
that
state
law
supplies
the
answer
in
cases
before
the
promulgation
of
the
1958
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
in
light
of
jewett
there
is
no
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
here
can
be
affirmed?
