justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
part
of
your
case...
now
i
don't
know
if...
there's
some
evidence
in
the
record,
as
i
understand
it,
that
without
this
instruction
the
jury
will
be
acting
on
a
false
premise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your...
whatever
your
standard
is,
it's
limited
to
situations,
as
i
understand
it,
where
in
the
absence
of
an
instruction
the
jury
will
be
mislead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
even
narrower
than
that,
mr.
bruck?
the
touchstone
you
say
is
reliability,
but
also
your...
part
of
your
touchstone,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
is
that
in
the
absence
of
the
instruction
the
jury
would
be
acting
on
a
false
premise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
in
the
chief
justice's
example
it
presumes,
you
know,
one
state
prison
in
each
state,
and
presumably
there's
not
much
doubt
about
where
the
man's
going
to
go,
so
you
wouldn't
need
the
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
thought
they
were
all
going
to
spend
their
life
in
a
country
club
somewhere,
then
perhaps
it
would
be
appropriate
to
clear
up
the
misunderstanding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
history
of
this
statute?
my
recollection
may
be
wrong
because
i
read
the
briefs
quite
a
long
time
ago,
but
is
it
correct
that
the
law-enforcement
community
in
the
state
originally
opposed
life
without
possibility
of
parole
because
they
thought
juries
would
then
be
inclined
to
give
that
sentence
rather
than
the
death
sentence;
it
might
reduce
the
number
of
death
sentences.
and
the
response
that
was
made
was,
well,
that
won't
happen
if
we
can
keep
from
the
juries
this
new
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
correct
that
one
of
the
arguments
in
response
was
made;
well,
we
will
adopt
a
rule
that
will
preclude
the
jury
from
getting
this
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that's
what
the
state
supreme
court
has,
in
effect,
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
but
with
specific
reference
to
this
precise
point,
it
is
the
law
of
the
state
that
the
jury
may
not
be
advised
of
this...
given
this
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
reason
for
it
is
that
they
would
therefore
be
less
likely
to
impose
the
death
sentence,
isn't
that
what
the
history
teaches
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
was
there
any
attempt
to
give
the
whole
truth
or
a
request
by
you
to
have
the
whole
truth
given?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
so
there...
that
isn't
before
us.
i
mean,
your
state
has
decided
not
to
have
the
whole
truth
go
forward.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
that
regime
were
held
to
be
invalid,
then
presumably
they
would
have
the
opportunity
in
the
next
case
to
say
we
ought
to
have
a
fair
instruction
that
tells
them
there
are
these...
some
possibilities
of
work
release
that
are
not
often
invoked,
but
it
is
at
least
a
possibility.
i
don't
think
your
opponent
is
denying
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
decided
that
a
half
truth
is
better
than
a
whole
truth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
perhaps
the
correct
principle
is
that
both
sides
should
be
willing
to
have
the
whole
truth
come
up,
but
that's
not
your
position.
