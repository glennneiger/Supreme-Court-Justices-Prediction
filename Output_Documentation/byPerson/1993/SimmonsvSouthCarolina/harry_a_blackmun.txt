justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
during
the
penalty
phase
of
petitioner's
state
court
trial,
the
state
argued
that
future
dangerousness
was
a
factor
for
the
jury
to
consider
in
deciding
between
the
death
penalty
and
life
imprisonment
for
the
murder
of
an
elderly
woman.
petitioner
in
rebuttal
presented
evidence
that
his
future
dangerousness
was
limited
to
elderly
women.
the
court
refused
to
give
the
jury
petitioner's
proposed
instruction
that
under
state
law
he
was
ineligible
for
parole.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
not
to
consider
parole
in
reaching
their
verdict.
a
death
sentence
was
returned.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
ruled
that
the
instruction
satisfies
in
substance
petitioner's
request
for
a
charge
on
ineligibility.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
that
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded.
the
opinion
i
have
written
is
only
a
plurality
and
is
joined
by
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
ginsburg.
we
would
hold
that
due
process
requires
that
the
sentencing
jury
be
informed
that
the
defendant
is
parole
ineligible.
the
trial
court's
instruction
did
not
satisfy
petitioner's
request
for
a
parole
ineligibility
charge.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
justice
o'connor,
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy,
concluded
that
where
the
state
puts
a
defendant's
future
dangerousness
at
issue
and
the
only
available
alternative
sentence
to
death
is
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
then
due
process
entitles
the
defendant
to
inform
the
sentencing
jury
that
he
is
parole
ineligible.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
