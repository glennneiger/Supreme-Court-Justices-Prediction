justice
david
h.
souter
what
your
position
really
boils
down
to
is
not,
as
i
understand
it,
a
position
about
information
or
a
position
about
alternatives.
it
boils
down
to
the
position
that
the
jury
should
know
the
meaning
of
the
terms,
the
meaning
which
the
law
gives
to
the
terms
that
the
jury
is
required
to
use
in
pronouncing
the
sentence.
is
that
the
nub
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you...
you
keep
answering
these
questions
in
terms
of
information.
why
don't
you
answer
the
question
in
terms
of
meaning?
they
want
to
know
whether
life
means
life
or
means
something
else,
and
isn't
that
a
far
stronger
argument
than
simply
the
argument
that
there
are
degrees
of
relevance
of
extraneous
information.
this
isn't
a
question
about
extraneous
information;
it's
a
question
about
meaning,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't...
but
your
point
is
the
meaning
of
a
word.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
mislead,
as
i
understand
it,
about
the
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
sometimes
speak
in
terms
of
fact,
but
what
you
want
them
told
is
what
a
legal
term
means
which
they
have
got
to
use
in
sentencing.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
some
jurors
may
think
it
means
life
subject
to
parole,
other
jurors
may
think
it
means
life
without
parole,
and
you
want
that
legal
definition
given
to
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
don't
you
just
limit
your
principle
here
to
saying
when
there
is
a
legitimate
doubt
about
the
meaning
of
a
term
which
is
used
in
instructing
the
jury,
and
which
the
jury
must,
in
turn,
use
in
sentencing,
that
term
must
be
defined.
why
don't
you
go
to
that
point
and
stop?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
crucial
fact
that
the
jury
is
sentencing
here
and
the
jury
is
normally
not
sentencing.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
we
assume
that
they
were
asking
what
they
asked,
and
they
asked
about
eligibility
for
parole?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
mr.
bruck's
suggested
instruction
was
inaccurate
in
that
respect,
but
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
jury
should
not
be
told
the
meaning
of
a
term
about
which
it
has
a
legitimate
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
think
there's
a
legitimate
question
possible
in
the
minds
of
jurors,
given
what
most
people
know
or
think
they
know
about
the
penal
system,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
term
"life"
includes
a
parole
eligibility
factor
or
whether
it
doesn't?
is
that
a
legitimate
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it's
a
legitimate
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
terms,
but
the
jury
cannot
be
given
a
legal
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
consequence
of
that,
it
seems
to
me,
based
on
what
you've
already
said,
is
that
the
jury
should
not
be
informed
about
the
meaning
of
a
term
that
it's
got
to
use.
it's
got
to
say
life
or
death.
the
jury
should
not
be
informed
about
the
legal
meaning
of
that
term
when
the
jury
has
a
question
about
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
judge's
response.
justice
david
h.
souter
plain
and
ordinary
meaning.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
problem
with
that
that
that
is
a...
given
the
premise
of
the
question,
it
is
a
totally
ambiguous
answer.
if
you
use
the...
if
it
has
the
ordinary
meaning
in
the
mind,
certainly,
of
some
jurors...
and
i
would
have
been
one
of
those
jurors
myself...
then
it
means
yes,
"life"
means
subject
to
parole.
if
you
give
it
a
plain
meaning
which
is
not
ordinary,
then
it
would
mean
life
does
not
include
eligibility
for
parole.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you've
got
to
answer
the
question,
that
wasn't
much
of
an
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
that
isn't
what
the
answer
was.
the
answer
was
you
give
the
terms
their
plain
and
ordinary
meaning--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
if
you
give
it
a
plain
meaning
in
a
strict
sense,
it
means
life
means
life.
if
you
give
it
a
meaning
in
an
ordinary
sense
to
lots
of
jurors
who
chink
they...
who
have
heard
about
the
parole
system,
then
it
would
mean
subject
to
parole.
but
whatever
that
answer
was,
it
was
not
a
plain
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
then
simply,
it
seems
to
me,
backtracking
on
your
answer.
you
agree
that
they
ought
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
terms
that
they've
got
to
use
in
sentencing.
you
don't
dispute
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
are
now
saying,
but
they
can't
be
told
about
that
term.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words
when
they
have
to
make
a
choice
between
the
death
penalty
and
life
imprisonment,
they
don't
need
to
know
the
meaning
of
life
imprisonment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we're
getting...
we're
getting
nowhere,
because
the
question
is
whether
they
are
entitled
to
a
clear
definition
responsive
to
their
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
answer,
then,
is
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
answer,
they
are
entitled
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
terms
they
have
to
use,
but
there's
no
problem
here
because
the
definition
they
got
was
adequate.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
do
need
to
know
the
definition
of
the
term
"life"
or
"life
imprisonment".
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and
you
say
they...
you
agree
that
they're
entitled
to
that
and
you
say
they
got
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me,
i
don't
want
to
play
with
words,
but
that
is
not
exactly
what
they
were
told.
they
were
told
that
the
terms
the
court
had
used
were
to
be
given
their
plain
and
ordinary
meaning.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it,
then,
that
if
we
think
or
a
majority
of
us
think
that
the
definition
was
inadequate,
that
it
just
did
not
respond
to
the
jury's
perplexity,
that
you
would
agree
there
would
have
to
be
a
reversal
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
don't
understand
what
i
thought
was
your
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
the
jury
was
or
was
not
entitled
to
be
told
the
definition
of
the
terms
it
was
using.
because
if
they're
entitled
to
be
told
the
definition
and
the
definition
is
not
inadequate,
i
would
suppose
it
would
follow
that
there
would
be
a
reversal.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
let's
assume,
for
the
sake
of
the
hypothetical,
that
it
does
fail,
there
would
have
to
be
a
reversal,
wouldn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're...
with
respect,
i
don't
want
to
cut
off
your
argument,
but
i
want
you
to
answer
my
question,
and
i
think
what
you're
doing
is
basically
denying
my
premise.
if
we
conclude
that
the
definition
was
not
adequate
to
inform
them--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
agree
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
reversal
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
it...
then
you
are
taking
the
position
that
the
jury
is
not
entitled
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
terms
which
it
must
use
in
pronouncing
the
sentence.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
you
are
saying,
if
i
understand
you,
that
they
do
have
to
use
this
term,
but
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
deny
them
a
definition
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
that's
what
south
carolina
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
talking
about
parole.
i'm
talking
about
the
meaning
of
life
imprisonment.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
they
have
to
be
given
the
definition
of
life
imprisonment
if
they're
going
to
use
that
as
a
sentencing
alternative?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
we're
back
to
the
question.
if
the
definition
they
were
given
by
the
court
is
inadequate,
if
we
assume
that...
you
don't,
i
recognize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'm
not
asking
you
to
concede
it.
but
if
you
assume
it
for
the
sake
of
argument,
then
we
get
a
reversal
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wasn't
the
jury
also
told
by
the
use
of
a
phrase
that
described
the
prisoner
as
being
"among
us"?
i
seem
to
recall
that
quotation
somewhere
in
the
briefs.
was
that
phrase
used
in
describing
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
the
description
of
him
as
being
amongst
us
suggest
a
different
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
it's...
the
argument
is
irrelevant
unless
it
is
assumed
that
he
will
at
some
point
also
continue
to
be
amongst
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
technically,
i
take
it
it
was
error
for
the
trial
judge
to
include
in
his
response
to
the
juror's
question
that
statement
about
giving
the
terms
their
plain
and
ordinary
meaning.
technically,
that
was
a
violation
of
the
supreme...
the
state
supreme
court's
position
that
you
don't
instruct
on
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they...
i
take
if
they
weren't
retreating
from
their
position,
they
must
have
assumed
that
it
didn't
amount
to
a
definition?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
a
definition
would
have
been
error.
i
mean
they...
to
get
into
the
issue
that
the
juror
was
concerned
with
would
have
been
to
get
into
issues
which
the
state
supreme
court
concludes
they
shouldn't
be
considering.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
that
it
has
in
this
case.
but
the
general
rule
still
is
that
you
don't
get
into
parole
issues,
so
therefore
assuming
the
state
supreme
court
is
at
least
internally
consistent
on
this
point,
it
must
have
assumed
that
this
particular
definition
did
not
get
into
an
instruction
on
parole
eligibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
you
had
gotten
what
you
asked
for.
at
least
to
the
extent
that
you
asked
for
it,
would
you
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
and
concede
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
read
some
more
instructions
to
the
jury,
some
more
statements
of
law
to
the
jury,
going
into
questions...
the
possibilities
of
furlough
and
work
release
and
so
on?
