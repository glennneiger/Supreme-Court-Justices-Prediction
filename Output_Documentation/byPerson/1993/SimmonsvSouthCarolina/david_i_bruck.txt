mr.
david
i.
bruck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
capital
case
is
whether
the
prosecution
can
secure
a
death
sentence
on
the
grounds
of
the
defendant's
future
dangerousness,
while
at
the
same
time
concealing
from
the
sentencing
jury
a
crucial
aspect
of
its
noncapital
sentencing
alternative,
namely
that
life
imprisonment
means
life
without
parole.
future
dangerousness
was
the
primary
reason
advanced
by
the
state
in
this
case
why
the
jury
should
sentence
jonathan
simmons
to
death.
the
defense
acknowledged
that
the
petitioner,
by
reason
of
his
serious
mental
illness,
was,
in
fact,
dangerous
or
would
be,
in
fact,
dangerous
were
he
released
back
into
society.
however,
the
defense
showed,
by
expert
and
lay
testimony,
a
likelihood
that
the
petitioner
would
make
a
nonviolent
and
cooperative
prison
inmate.
now,
the
jury
itself
identified
the
crucial
piece
of
missing
information
in
this
presentation.
after
90
minutes
of
deliberation
on
the
issue
of
penalty,
the
jury
returned
to
the
courtroom
and
asked
the
following
question:
does
the
imposition
of
a
life
sentence
carry
with
it
the
possibility
of
parole?
and
the
trial
judge
responded
by
telling
them
three
things:
you
are
instructed
not
to
consider
parole;
that
is
not
a
proper
issue
for
your
consideration;
and
life
imprisonment
and
death
sentence
are
to
be
understood
in
their
plain
and
ordinary
meaning.
the
issue
in
this
case
arises
because
of
the
fact
that
under
south
carolina
law
the
correct
answer
to
the
jury's
question
was
no.
because
jonathan
simmons
had
prior
convictions
for
a
violent
offense,
under
south
carolina
law
life
meant
exactly
that,
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
that
was
what
the
jury
wanted
to
know
and
that
is
what
the
petitioner
urged
they
be
told.
the
state,
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial,
successfully
impressed
upon
the
trial
judge
not
to
tell
the
jury.
it
was
obvious
how
critical
this
information
was
going
to
be
and
the...
it
was
obvious
what
an
advantage
the
state
would
receive
if
alone
among
everybody
in
the
courtroom,
the
jury
alone
would
be
the
only
ones
not
to
know.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
not
at
all.
but
here
where
there
is
absolutely
no
justifiable,
there
is
no
rational
state
interest
in
refusing
to
give
the
information
that
the
jury
asked
for
and
where
the
information
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
was
so
crucial
to
a
reliable
and
fair
determination
of
the
sentence.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
certainly.
however,
what
the
alternative
to
death
is
in
a
case
where
the
state
is
basically
saying...
not
basically,
where
the
state
is
literally
arguing
to
the
jury
this
is
a
matter
of
self-defense.
that
was
mr.
harpootlian's
jury
argument.
the
question
before
you
is
what
to
do
with
someone
who
is
a
threat.
he
told
the
jury
you...
the
issue
is
not
what
made
him
this
way.
there
was
all
this
evidence
of
very
very
extreme
abuse
and
sexual
abuse
and
violence
in
this
man's
childhood.
the
state's
response
was
the
question
before
you
is
what
to
do
with
him
now
that
he
is
in
our
midst.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
oh,
i'm
sorry,
excuse
me.
there
is
no
jury
sentencing
except
in
one
or
two...
no
there
is,
i
believe,
non
whatsoever
now.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
not
by
any
means.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
jury's
task
at
the...
in
the
hypothetical
you
put
to
me
is
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence,
without
regard
to
what
is
going
to
happen.
but
in
this
case,
in
capital
sentencing,
the
jury's
task
is
to
sentence.
and,
of
course,
the
state
cannot
derive
any
comfort
from
the
principle
that
sentencing
issues
shouldn't
interfere
with
guilt
in
a
proceeding
which
is
a
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
and
most
particularly
our
gardner
claim,
our
due
process
claim,
is
that
even
if
the
eighth
amendment
did
not
require
an
affirmative
answer
to
that
question,
where
the
state
puts
the
meaning
of
the
noncapital
sentencing
so
clearly
into
issue...
and
we
know
it
was
an
issue
not
only
because
of
the
evidence
and
the
solicitor's...
the
prosecutor's
argument,
but
because
of
the
jury's
question.
there
surely...
leaving
all
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
to
one
side
for
a
moment,
there
obviously
it
just
isn't
fair.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
would
submit
that
there
is...
one
quite
reach...
readily
reaches
a
de
minimis
level
where
the--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--um--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
don't
think
they
have
absolutely
no
relevance,
but
i
think
it
is
within
the
broad
range
of
the
state's
ability,
under
cases
such
as
johnson
v.
texas,
to
channel
and
mold
the
jury's
consideration
of
sentencing
factors.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
that's
correct.
because
this
issue
not
only
goes
to
the
retributive...
although
we
think
the
retributive
importance
of
this
life
without
parole
information
is
very
significant,
but
it
pales
towards...
beside
the
incapacitating--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--that
would
eliminate
parole--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
would
think--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
don't
think
the
constitution,
obviously,
requires
that
they
be
told.
i
think
this
is...
generally,
the
whole
range
of...
well,
can
we
tell
them
this;
can
we
tell
them
that...
that
is
found
in
the
state's
brief,
was
answered
10
years
ago
in
california
v.
ramos.
the
court
addresses
the
question,
is
the
information
reliable;
is
it
accurate?
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
suppose
the...
justice
scalia's
question
could
always
be
posed,
well,
it
means
life
without
parole,
but
then
it
also
means
that
he
will
or
won't
have
a
tv
set.
i
don't
agree
with
that
and
i
think
that
stretches--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--whatever.
i
think
that
stretches
the
concept
of
the
meaning
of
a
sentence
beyond
all
bounds,
but
i
can...
i
would
be
surprised
if
my
friend
doesn't
make
the
argument
in
a
moment.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
that's
right.
and
the
importance
of
clarifying
what
the
meaning--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
absolutely.
and
the
trial
judge,
at
the
prosecutor's
urging,
refused
to
allow
precisely
that
argument.
and
you
can
see--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
turning
to
the
eighth
amendment,
the
skipper-locket
aspect,
which
this
court
need
not
reach,
but
if
it
were
to
reach
that,
i
think
the
language
from
justice
powell's
opinion
in
mccleskey,
any
relevant
circumstance
which
could
cause
the
jury
to
fail
to...
to
decline
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
now--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
because
i
think
given
the
fact
that
the
method
of
execution
is
constrained
by
the
eighth
amendment
and
there
is
no
torturous
or
cruel
form
of
execution
permitted,
i
think
it
is
within...
lockett
does
not
remove
the
power
of
the
state
to
say
that
that
is
not
relevant,
and
therefore
it
is
not
irrelevant
circumstance.
but
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
the
fact
that
jonathan
simmons
will
not
allow...
again,
allow...
be
allowed
to
be
paroled
and
to
roam
the
streets
is
not
a
relevant
circumstance.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
of
course,
this
case
is
about
parole,
and
the
court
need
go
no
further
than
to
say
that
when
the
state
has
a...
has
a
dangerous
mentally
ill
defendant
who
it
wishes
to
execute,
it
cannot
urge
the
jury...
it
cannot
create
a
false
dilemma.
i
think
beck
is
instructive,
although
not
on
point,
in
this
area.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
the
court
has
struggled
with
the
meaning
of
relevant.
in
skipper
the
state
of
south
carolina
urged
that
it
was
not
relevant
that
the
defendant
would
be
a
well-behaved
prisoner,
because
it
went...
in
the
future
in
prison,
because
it
went
neither
to
his
character
and
record
nor
to
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
and
the
court
responded
that
that
future...
likely
future
behavior,
albeit
only
in
prison,
was
relevant
in
the
sense...
or
was
mitigating
in
the
sense
that
it
might
reasonably
incline
the
jury
to
be
less
likely
to
vote
for
a
sentence
of
death.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
we
do
not
think
that
it
was
necessary.
this
was
a
matter
of
law
and
our
claim
is
limited
to
those
situations
in
which--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i'm
asking--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i'm
asking
you
to
hold
that
where
parole
is
not
an
option,
where
state
law
is
clear,
as
it
is
here,
that
the
jury
not
have
that
information
withheld
from
them.
our...
the
center
of
our
case
was
a
request
that
state
law
be
instructed
to
the
jury
by
the
judge.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
correct.
the
state
moved
and
the
judge
so
ruled.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
it
is
the
latter.
so
long
as
the
defendant
is
able
to
have
the
jury
informed,
whether
it
be
by
his
counsel
or
by
the
court.
now,
of
course,
the
jury
might
not
take
counsel's
word
for
it
and
might
very
well,
even
had
argument
been
allowed,
come
back
with
this
question,
in
which
case
we
think
that
the
judge
should
have
responded.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
i
think
that
the...
it's...
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
lay
down
a
rule,
i
think,
that
does
not
have
some
element
of
generality
in
it
to
propose
one.
and
i
think...
i
don't
know
that
the
court
need
establish
or
that
it
is
possible
to
establish
a
bright-line
rule
which
will
clearly
cover
every
conceivable
fact
situation.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
correct,
about
the
meaning--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
is
a
entirely
satisfactory
way
of
framing
the
issue
and
it
does...
i
must
say
that
it
does
simplify
the
issue
of
how
to--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
read
ramos--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--fair
is
fair.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
fair
is
fair.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
agree
with
that
if
it's
true.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
if
the
prosecutor
can
produce
south
carolina
law
to
show
that,
in
fact--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--life
doesn't
really
mean
life,
even
though
there's
no
parole.
ramos
settled
that
a
long
time
ago.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
i
don't
say
that
can't
be
done
at
all.
the
crucial
fact
here
is
that
there
is
no
parole
system
for
this
defendant.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
that's
true.
and,
of
course,
the
information...
the
legal
definition
that
we
think
the
jury
should
have
had
of
its
sentencing
alternative
is
a
legal
definition
known
to
the
sentencer
in
99.9999
percent
of
sentencing
proceedings.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
i
do
not
view
that
as
part
of
the
legal
definition
of
its
sentencing
alternative.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
south
carolina
law
does
not
provide
for
statutory
law.
the
law
defining
the
punishments
does
not
deal
with
classification
and
institutional
assignment.
now,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any...
if
the
state
wants
to
show,
through
evidence
or
however,
that
there
are
huge
security...
there
are...
you
know,
there
are
some...
in
other
words,
if
a
state
wishes
to
show
facts
about
the
prison
system
that
support
its
view
of
future
dangerousness
and
show
that
the
risk
from
the
defendant
is
greater
than
simply
life
without
parole
might
suggest,
i
see,
under
california
v.
ramos,
the
constitution
providing
no
bar.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
if
that
information
is
accurate,
i
think
that
that...
that
under
the...
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
a
state
supreme
court
would
allow
that
sort
of
collateral
trial,
but
i,
frankly,
have
to
say
i
don't
read
the
eighth
amendment,
under
your
cases,
as
creating
a
bar.
providing...
the
touchstone
is
accuracy
and
reliability,
and
i
think...
our
claim
does
not
engage
all
of
these
factual
matters.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
might,
and
we
submit
in
this
case
likely
did,
yes.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
because
of
the
way
the
case
was
presented;
because
of
the
facts
of
the
case;
because
of
the
manifest
dangerousness
of
this
man's
record
and
of
his
mental
illness;
because
of
the
prosecuted
argument;
because
of
the
fact
that
the
defense
was
prevented
from
making
this
crucial
argument
that
you
can
protect
society
adequately,
you
can
exercise
the
right
of
collective
self-defense
without
putting
him
to
death.
and
because,
finally,
lest
there
be
the
slightest
doubt,
the
jury
not
only
came
back
and
asked
the
question,
but
when
the
judge
gave
a
25
minutes
with
death.
it
was
thank
you
very
much;
that
is
what
we
needed
to
know;
we
are
not
going
to
take
the
risk
that
this
man
will
be
back
on
the
street
in
the
very
vivid
way
that
the
prosecutor
described
in
his
closing
argument.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
mr.
chief
justice,
i
rise
only
to
clarify
a
couple
of
factual
items.
mr.
harpootlian,
no
doubt
inadvertently,
misdescribed
the
requested
instruction
made
by
the
defendant.
the
request
is
at
page...
pages
21
and
22
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
is
simply
that
the
judge
read
the
no
parole
statute
to
the
jury.
as
an
alternative
when
that
was
denied,
we
then
requested,
as
very
much
second
or
third
best,
a
more
vague
instruction
about
that
he
actually
will
be
sentenced
to
serve
life
in
the
state
penitentiary.
but
that
was
not
the
request
we
made
and
that
is
not
the
request
upon
which
this
case
turns.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
providing
those
are
accurate,
i
think
under
the
eighth
amendment,
for
purposes
of
this
morning,
yes.
i
don't
think
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
will
necessarily
allow
these...
what
are,
in
fact,
very
speculative
and
remote
possibilities.
the
record,
as
opposed
to
the
list
that
mr.
harpootlian
just--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--absolutely.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
and,
of
course,
in
this
case
it
is
not
only...
the
chance
of
his
being
released
on
parole
is
not
merely
highly
speculative
but
legally
nonexistent.
the
record
actually
shows
that
no
life
without
parole
inmate
had
ever
been
granted
a
furlough,
and
it
goes
on
and
one.
under
the
regulations
they
are
not
eligible
for
work
release.
this
long
laundry
list
of
12
possibilities,
if
you
look
closely
at
the
record,
is
actually
vanishingly
small.
and,
yes,
we
are
willing
to
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet,
as
a
matter
of
eighth
amendment
law.
justice
o'connor
inquired
about
the
list
of
states.
i
would
simply
direct
the
court's
attention
to
pages
39
to
41
of
our
brief,
that's
footnotes
23
to
27,
which
gives
in
some
detail
exactly
what
all
of
the
life-without-parole
states
have
to
say
on
this
issue.
finally,
i
would
just
note
the
issue...
the
history
of
this
issue
in
south
carolina
has
been
somewhat
torturous.
we
describe
it
in
our
brief.
shortly
after
life
without
parole
became
an
option
for
recidivist
cases,
the
state
supreme
court
said
that
on
the
request
of
a
defendant
restrictions
on
parole
should
be
charged,
and
that
was
the
law
until
a
month
before
this
trial.
this
is
the
first
case
to
be
tried
under
the
new
regime
of
state
v.
torrence
which
overruled
that
majority
practice
and
said
that
from
now
on
the
jury
should
be
left
in
the
dark,
and
therefore
i
think
it
is
at
least
fortuitous
that
this
practice
is
a
novel
one
and
can
and
should,
we
submit,
be
nipped
in
the
bid.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that's
all
we
have.
