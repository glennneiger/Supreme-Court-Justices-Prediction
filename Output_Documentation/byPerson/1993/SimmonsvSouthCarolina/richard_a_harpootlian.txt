mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
me
that
the
linchpin
of
mr.
bruck's
argument,
and
the
fiction
that
we
need
to
examine,
is
that
throughout
his
argument
to
the
lower
court
and
his
presentation
here
today
he
equates
the
term
"ineligibility
of
parole"
with
"ineligibility
of
release".
when
the
jury
came
back
and
asked
when
would
he
be
eligible
for
parole,
were
they
asking
that
limited,
specific,
technical
term,
or
were
they
asking
when
will
he
be
eligible
to
be
released?
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
well,
justice
souter,
they
may
have
asked
about
eligibility
for
parole.
the
requested
instruction
by
mr.
bruck
during
trial
was
concluded
with
the
term
that
he
will
remain
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
in
south
carolina
while
the
governor
does
not
have
the
power
to
pardon,
the
pardon
and
parole
board
does.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
i
think
the
jury
should
be
told
the
meaning
of
the
term.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
i
think
it
is
a
legitimate
question,
and
the
response
by
the
south
carolina
judge
under
the
south
carolina
case
of
torrence
is
that
you
cannot
consider
parole;
do
not
consider
parole
or
parole
eligibility.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
well,
i
think
that
the
jury
was
given
the
legal
answer,
which
is
something
we
should
not
consider.
it
is
not
something
that
you
should
consider
as
part
of
your
sentence.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
they
were
given
the
meaning
of
the
term
"life".
they
were
told--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
yes,
sir.
"life"--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--well
the
answer
was
life
means
life.
the
answer
was--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--without
considering--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--but
they
have
been
told
not
to
consider
parole.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
no,
sir,
i
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
i
don't
think
that
is
a
term
that
is
necessary
for
them
to
know
about
in
sentencing.
it
is
a
decision
to
be
made--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--life
imprisonment,
for
their
purposes,
was
defined
as
life
imprisonment.
life--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--and
i
submit
that
they
got
a
clear
definition
of
that
charge.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
they
do
not
need
to
know
the
definition
of
the
term
"parole"
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
yes,
sir.
and
they
were
given
that.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
to
go
beyond
life
means
life,
and
that's
exactly
what
they
were
told,
we
would
have
to
discuss
pardon,
work
release,
furlough.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
yes,
sir.
because
to
go
beyond
that
would
open
up,
in
the
south
carolina
court's
opinion,
a
can
of
worms.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
in...
this
court,
in
a
number
of
cases,
penry
v.
lynaugh,
did
not
define
the
term...
the
court
did
not
define
the
term
deliberately.
and
yet
this
court
found
that
was
sufficient.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
no,
sir,
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
no,
sir.
my
position
is
that...
first
of
all,
i
would
not...
obviously,
for
purposes
of
your
hypothetical,
that
it
would
fail.
i
don't
concede
it
fails.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
get
to
the
logical
assumption
that
it
fails,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
well,
i
would
submit
that
the
definitional
term
of
"life
imprisonment",
if
you
have
to
define
every
term,
if
you
have
to
parse--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--you--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--as
to
the
second
part
of
the
charge,
if
that
was
inadequate,
that
life
means
life,
that
you
were
to
give
it
the
plain
and
ordinary
meaning.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
i
would
not
concede
that
because
of
the
prior
sentence
which...
in
which
the
judge
indicated
do
not
consider
parole
or
parole--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--i
am
of
the
opinion--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--the
term--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--i
just
don't
think
parole
is
part
of
the
definition
of
the
term--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--no,
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--i
think
that
they
have
to
be
given...
they
have
to
have
a
definition
of
life.
i
just
don't
think
parole
is
part
of
that.
and
i
think
that
the
first
sentence
excludes
parole
from
that.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
right.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
if
one
of
the
two
sentences
is
misunderstood,
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
misunderstanding
under
boyde,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
if
we
have
not
met
the
boyde...
the
boyde
v.
california
standard.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
there
are
a
variety...
different
states
have
different
schemes,
if
you
will.
pursuant
to
this
court's
decision
in
ramos,
the
states
felt
that
they
could
develop
different
schemes.
and
a
number--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--many--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--many
do,
but
many
have
a
specific
verdict
by
the
jury
of
life
without
parole.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
there
are
three.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
virginia,
south
carolina,
north
carolina...
and
pennsylvania,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
yes,
sir,
i'm
sorry.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
to
expand
the
eighth
amendment
to
include
the
custody
status,
if
you
will,
of
a
defendant
or
a
petitioner
such
as
this,
strains
the
use
of
the
eighth
amendment.
now,
in
skipper
this
court
ruled
that
future
adaptability
to
prison
was
relevant
to
the
sentencing
authority's
decision.
and
to
that
end,
we
go
back
to
the
court's
prior
cases,
lockett
and
eddings
and
other
cases,
in
which
you
talk
about
the
character
of
the
defendant,
the
characteristics
of
his
crime
and
his
prior
record.
skipper
specifically
speaks
to
future
adaptability
as
being
a
characteristic
of
the
defendant.
how
can
parole
ineligibility
or
parole
status
fit
within
that...
that
classification?
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
that
is
not
the
circumstances
in
this
case.
however,
if
he
did
that,
i
think
so,
yes,
mr.
kennedy.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
no
argument
about
release,
about
parole,
about
being
back
out
on
the
street.
and
i
would
challenge--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--well,
in
this
case
the
petitioner's
own
psychologist
testified
he
would
be
dangerous,
number
one.
number
two,
we
have
the
skipper
adaptability--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--well,
the
skipper
adaptability
evidence
was
introduced
by
petitioner
and
so
my
position
is
that
pursuant
to
the
argument
taken
in
contex
with
the
judge's
charge,
and
argument
by
defense
counsel
where,
on
joint
appendix
page
125,
petitioner's
argument
was
that
he's
22
years
of
age,
a
life
sentence
is
punishment.
the
petitioner
in
his
argument
talked
about
life
being
life.
the
jury,
i
submit,
as
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
found
in
their
decision
in
this
case,
understood
life
to
mean
life.
and
so
the
argument
has
to
be
in
the
context
of
what
the
jury
was
told,
not
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
submits
for
my
examination.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
yes,
sir,
in
the
context...
in
this
context.
the
argument
was
that
the
defense
has
provided
testimony
to
you
that
he
was
abused
as
a
child,
that
he
underwent
a
number
of
difficulties
as
a
child,
that
he
suffers
from
a
series
of
stimuli,
if
you
will,
over
his
young
age
that
made
him
what
he
is
today.
the
argument
was
that
the
question
isn't
how
he
got
here.
he's
here;
what
do
we
do
with
him
now
that
he
is
here
amongst
us
in
our
midst.
the
question
is
is
the
enormity
of
the
crime,
that
is
his
personal
characteristics,
his
record,
his
personal
characteristics,
enough...
and
i
submit
it
was...
for
him
to
be
sentenced
to
the
ultimate
punishment
of
death.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
well,
even
if
you
were
to
assume
that
he
was
parole
eligible,
as
apparently
the
assumption
here
is,
that
the
jury
assumed
that,
that
doesn't
mean
he's
going
to
be
paroled.
there
is
no
conclusion
that
he
is
going
to
be
out.
even
if
you
assume,
that's
a
decision
that
will
be
made
by
someone...
again,
the
equation
here
is
that...
not
only
that
parole
ineligibility
means
he
won't
be
released,
but
parole
eligibility
means
that
he
will.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
that
he
could...
that
if
he
argued
future
crimes
against
society
in
general,
yes,
i
think
so,
but
that
wasn't
done
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
no,
sir,
again
i
would
not
concede
that
reversal
is
necessary
if
you
find
that
there
was
some
talk
about
future
dangerousness
beyond
the
penal
institutions.
i
would
suggest
that,
again,
one...
you're
talking...
implying
that
due
process
is
somehow
violated
by
the
implication,
if
you
will,
of
future
dangerousness.
the
judge's
charge
corrected
any
assumption
that
the
jury
would
have
had
that
he
posed
a
future
danger
to
them.
i
don't...
he
told
them
to
disregard
any
terms
about
parole
or
parole
eligibility
and
to
give
the
term
"life
imprisonment"
its
natural...
its
plain
and
ordinary
meaning.
so
i
would
not
concede
that
even
had
the
prosecutor
argued
that
he's
some
danger,
that
that
was
corrected
by
this
instruction...
the
primary
instruction
by
the
court,
which
was...
he
used
terms
"life
imprisonment"
and
"death
by
electrocution"
throughout
his
charge,
and
then
when
the
jury
came
back
and
asked
about
the
possibility
of
parole,
to
clarify
that
by
saying
disregard
it.
just
as
if
they
have
come
back
and
asked
about
some
other
impermissible
area
for
their
inquiry,
the
burden
of
proof,
or
why
the
defendant
didn't
testify,
a
number
of
other
areas
that
this
court
has
found
that
curative
or
cautionary
instructions
are
very
proper.
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
decided
that
parole
eligibility
or
ineligibility
is
not
a
proper
concern
for
a
jury.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
well,
in,
of
course,
state
v.
atkinson,
which
is
the
early...
the
seventies
case,
that
was
the
rationale.
but
as
we
go
from
state
v.
atkins
in
1987
through
state
v.
torrence
in
1991,
i
think
the
supreme
court
has
decided
that
the...
that
these
extraneous
factors
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
criteria
laid
out
in
lockett
of
the
defendant--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
the
initial
reason.
and,
of
course,
in
ramos,
which
petitioner
cited,
the
briggs
instruction
was
in
response
to
this...
the
jury
being
told
of
his
ineligibility
for
parole.
we
don't
have,
and
our
supreme
court
has
decided
that
they
don't
want
to
go
through
that
process.
and
footnote
30
in
ramos
and
the
rationale
in
ramos
is
that
this
is
a
decision
best
left
to
the
states.
and
that's
what
the
state
of
south
carolina
did.
the
relied
on
the
logic
and
rationale
of
ramos
to
exclude
factors
which
they
thought
would
cause
undue
speculation
with
the
jury--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--well,
i
think
that's
an
oversimplification.
there
were
some
segments
of
the
law-enforcement
community
that
indicated
they
did
not
want
it.
some
segments
of
the
law-enforcement
community
said
they
did.
and
certainly
there's
no
uniform
position.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
i'm
sure
someone
made
that
argument,
but
i
don't...
in
my
opinion--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--what
the
state
of
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
done
is
asked
the
jury
not
to
consider
any...
not
just
parole,
but
any
other
extraneous
sentencing
factor.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
i
think
not.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
it
came
from
newspaper
articles.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
one
adopted
by
the
court.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
life
with
parole
and
the
death
penalty?
justice
scalia,
yes,
in
most
cases,
i
would
submit,
especially
in
light
of
an
amendment
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
by
the
legislature,
amending
this
law
to
do
away
with
the
enhancement
of
any...
the
use
of
a
conviction
prior
to
january
1,
1986
to
enhance.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
if--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--in
most
cases
one
would...
in
south
carolina
right
now
you
would
have
to
have
a
prior...
a
conviction
for
a
violent
crime
which
carries
a
substantial
sentence,
in
most
instances
do
your
time,
get
out,
commit
a
subsequent
crime.
and
that
prior
conviction
would
have
had
to
have
occurred...
or
offense
would
have
had
to
have
occurred
after
january
1,
1986.
so
it
really
narrows...
the
amendment
by
the
legislature
last
year
limiting
the
pool,
if
you
will,
limiting
the
enhancement
aspect
of
that,
has
really
narrowed
the
pool,
so
most
defendants
are
going
to
fall
into
the
parole-eligible
category.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
well,
the
state
supreme
court
in
their
decision
noted
that
he
used
terms
that
are
used
in
state
v.
norris,
but
they
found
that
not
to
be
error,
they
found
that
to
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
your
honor...
well,
i
do
not
assume
that.
no,
sir,
i
don't
assume
that.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
this
case
stands
for
the
proposition
it
was
not
error.
our
supreme
court
has
decided
that
was
not
error.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
well,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
that
that
they
had
not
previously
put
the
two
together.
they
found
it
to
be
constitutionally
acceptable.
and
the
definition
certainly
assisted...
should
assist
the
jury
in
their...
as
they
said
in
their
opinion,
it
would
tell
the
jury
that
life
means
life.
that
is
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
conclusion
as
to
the
result
of
this
charge.
so
considering
the
eighth
amendment
violation
and...
the
petitioner
would
ask
you
to
expand
that
way
beyond
skipper,
to
go
to
a
definition
that
excludes...
that
goes
outside
the
definition
that's
been
previously
used
by
this
court,
and
to...
i
would
submit
to
you,
to
result
in
a
situation
which
would
only
be
part
of
the
truth,
only
a
small
part
of
the
truth.
there
are
12
statutorily
authorized
programs,
if
you
will,
that
could
result
in
a
defendant
in
a
nonparole
sentence,
life
sentence,
to
be
back
into
the
community.
so
if
you
are
going
to
open
that
can
of
worms,
if
you
will,
and
our
supreme
court
has
said
you
shall
not,
you
end
up
in
a
situation
where...
and,
of
course,
in
ramos
it
was
found
by
this
court
to
be
constitutionally
acceptable
to
do
that,
but
not
mandated.
and
as
a
result
the

all

our
state
supreme
court,
following
the
direction
given
in
state...
in
the
ramos--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--well,
i
submit,
justice
ginsburg,
the...
i
agree
with
you,
it
should
not
be,
it
would
not
be
a
must.
but
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
indicated
that
if
we're
going
to
consider
one
release
mechanism,
that
it
would
open
the
door
to
the
consideration
of
other
release
mechanisms.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
if
you're
bound
by
some
principle.
and
i
guess
that
raises
the
question,
what
is
the
principle
here?
the
principle
that
petitioner
would
have
you
adopt
is
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
eighth
amendment
requires
juries
to
have
a
piece
of
the
truth,
not
the
whole
truth.
the...
whether
or
not
the--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--under
state
v.
torrence
we're
not
allowed--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
but
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
decided
that
is
less
fair.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
well,
but
the
half
truth
that
the
petitioner
would
have
is
that
he
will...
and
if
you
look
at
the
appendix,
you
will
note
that
he
speaks
in
terms
of
never
being
eligible...
will
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
jail.
that
is
the
half
truth
he
wants.
those
are
the
half
truths
that
we
were
confronted
with.
you
can't--
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
--that
is
not
my
position...
that
is
not
the
state
of
south
carolina's
position.
i
am
a
prosecutor.
i
perhaps
have
a
different
position
than
the
state
of
carolina
personally.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
i
think
that
if
i
could
get
in
front
of
a
jury
and
read
this
list
of
a
dozen
programs
that
would
make
him
eligible
for
release,
that
we
would
have
no
more
life
sentences
in
the
state
of
south
carolina.
and
that
is
the
principle
that
the
state
of
south
carolina,
through
its
supreme
court,
has
adopted.
mr.
richard
a.
harpootlian
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that,
no
question.
many
more,
many,
many,
many
more.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
result
will
be
that...
in
south
carolina,
if
we
get
into
the
release
mechanisms...
not
just
parole,
but
if
we
get
into
those
release
mechanisms,
i
can
assure
you
as
a
prosecutor,
having
appeared
before
juries
many,
many
times
on
these
kinds
of
cases,
that
the
jury
then
will
discount
the
value
of
a
life
sentence.
thank
you
very
much.
