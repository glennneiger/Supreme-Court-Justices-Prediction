justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
argue
simply
that
you're
entitled
to
the
instruction
if
the
jury
asks?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
not
the
foundation
of
your
argument
that
the
defense
counsel
is
entitled
to
make
this
argument
to
the
jury
if
it
chooses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what--
--so
is
the
premise
of
that
position
that
the
jury
is
entitled
to
hear
from
counsel
or
from
the
court
anything
that
is
likely
to
be
relevant
to
the
jury's
sentencing
decision?
is
that
the
working
principle
we
have?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
a
prosecutor
wanted
to
put
in...
or,
pardon
me,
a
defense
counsel
wanted
to
put
in
a
videotape
of
what
an
execution
looks
like,
he
should
be
able
to
do
that
so
the
jury
could
see
the
consequences
of
what
they're
doing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
we're
struggling
for
the
definition
of
what's
relevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
are
we
going
to
do
that
in
the
confines
of
this
case,
other
than
make
it
parole
specific?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
leaves
us
without
a
guiding
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume--
--and
that
is
because
parole
is
likely
to
be
an
essential
or
a
material
or
a
substantial
factor
in
the
jury's
decision?
is
that
the
standard
we're
working
with?
we
need
a
standard
here
i
know
what
you
want
so
far
as
specific
relief,
but
i'm
not
sure
of
the
underlying
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
a
case
the
prosecutor
tells
the
jury,
sentence
this
man
to
death
because
if
you
don't
he
can
roam
free
some
day
and
kill
somebody?
suppose
the
prosecutor
says
that
to
the
jury,
is
the
defense
counsel
entitled
to
say,
now,
you've
heard
the
prosecutor's
argument,
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
in
this
state
there's
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole,
which
would
apply
to
this
defendant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
my
next
point.
wasn't
it,
in
effect,
argued
here
when
the
prosecutor
said
whether
or
not
the
sentence
of
death
for
simmons
will
deter
anybody
else.
i
submit
to
you
the
fact
that
it
will
deter
him
is
plenty,
and
your
verdict
should
be
a
response
of
society
to
someone
who's
a
threat.
your
verdict
will
be
an
act
of
self-defense.
don't
avoid
your
responsibility.
it's
an
act
of
self-defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
think
jurors
could
fairly
infer
from
that
argument
that
he
was
a
danger
to
society
because
he
might
be
released?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
the
more
reason
to
tell
the
jury
that
he's
going
to
be
confined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
i
thought
you
had
conceded
at
the
outset
in
your
answer
to
my
first
question
that
if
the
prosecutor
did
make
an
argument
about
prevention
of
future
crimes,
that
counsel...
defense
counsel
could
respond
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if...
so
if
we
disagree
with
you
in
our
interpretation
of
what
the
jury
might
fairly
infer
from
the
prosecutor's
argument,
then
we
must
reverse
on
that
basis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
have
not
advanced
a
theory
in
this
court
that
the
state
would
be
mandated
to
advise
the
jury
that
the
defendant
is
eligible
parole...
for
parole.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we've
just
said
that
it'd
be
permitted,
if
it
chooses.
