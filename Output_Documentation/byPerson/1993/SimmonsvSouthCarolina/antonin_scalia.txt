justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
jury
asks...
surely,
you
know,
how
severe
the
alternative
punishment
is
is
always
an
issue.
suppose
the
jury
comes
back
and
says
do
prisoners
in
state
prisons
have
television
sets;
how
big
are
the
cells
in
state
prisons?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
that
that's
de
minimis.
the...
you
know,
will
this
man
be
on
a
chain
gang
or
are
there
any
chain
gangs
in
the
state
anymore?
justice
antonin
scalia
those
are
very
relevant
questions
for
a
jury
that
wants
to
know
how
severely
this
person
is
going
to
be
punished
if
the
capital
sentence
is
not
imposed.
why
are
those
questions
irrelevant?
i
don't
think
they're
irrelevant
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
just
not
this
question.
the
other
ones
can
be
excluded
but
this
one
can't.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
there's
a
statutory
amendment
pending
that
would
eliminate
parole?
is
the
judge
supposed
to
tell;
how
does
he
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no...
parole
is
unavailable...
i'm
sorry,
that
would
make
parole
available.
parole
is
unavailable
now,
but
there
is
a
bill
currently
being
debated.
can
he
tell
them
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
problem
of
answering
them
with
respect
to
anything
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
life
in
prison,
but
it
isn't
really
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does,
mr.
bruck.
but
if
it
goes
to
the
meaning
of
the
word,
i
assume
it
would
go
the
meaning
whether
the
answer
is
yes
or
no,
right?
and
that
would
mean
the
prosecutors
would
be
entitled
to
introduce
in
these
cases
the
fact
that
if
you
give
this
individual
life,
it
really
doesn't
mean
life,
he'll
be
walking
the
streets
in
20
years,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
fair
is
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
goes
to
the
meaning
of
the
word,
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
it
is
my
impression...
it
is--
--i
just
want--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
my
impression
that
some
states
exclude
information
about
parole
for
the
very
purpose
that
juries
will
not
distort
the
state
parole
system
by
discounting
it
in
advance,
so
that
knowing
that
a
person's
going
to
get
time
off
for
good
behavior,
or
whatever,
they
up
the
sentence
from
what
it
otherwise
would
be
in
order
to
defeat
the
parole
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
perfectly
rational
thing
for
a
state
to
do,
it
seems
to
me.
and
you're
saying
that
that
can't
be
done,
because
35
years
doesn't
really
mean
35
years
if
there's
a
parole
system,
or
life
does
not
really
mean
life
if
there's
a
parole
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
the
jury
will
send
this
man
to
his
death
if
he...
if
it
knows
he's
only
otherwise
going
to
be
in
prison
for
25
years,
whereas
it
might
otherwise
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
you
contend
is
that
they
were
told
that
the
sentence
that
they
would
impose
would
be
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
they
do
not
have
to
be
told
that
there
are
other
laws
which
we
have
in
our
state
which
would
enable
a
person
sentenced
to
life
in
prison,
which
is
a
sentence
for
life,
to
perhaps
get
parole,
to
perhaps
get
a
pardon,
to
perhaps
get
work
relief,
all
other
different
laws
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
"life".
justice
antonin
scalia
pennsylvania
instead
of
north
carolina
or
in
addition?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
history
didn't
come
from
supreme
court
conferences.
i
assume
it
came
from
the
legislature.
justice
antonin
scalia
from
newspaper
articles.
and
was
this
rule
imposed
by
the
legislature
or
is
it
one
adopted
by
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
sentence
in
south
carolina
that...
would
a
jury
ever
be
put
nowadays
to
a
choice
between
life
with
parole
and
the
death
penalty,
or
is
the
only...
is
the
only
choice
between--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
if
we
believe
in
evenhandedness
and
say
that
the
jury
must
be
advised
when
it
is
life
without
parole,
we
would
then
say
that
the
jury
must
be
advised
when
it
is
life
with
parole?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
situation
can
arise.
justice
antonin
scalia
her
point
is
that
if
it
must
be
provided
under
coercion,
under
the
coercion
of
some
principle,
that
principle
would
require
that
other
things
besides
parole
be
provided.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
must
in
that
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
we're
bound
by
some
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
you'd
do
better,
maybe,
with
the
whole
truth
coming
out
in
all
the
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
taking
just
parole
alone,
if
i
understood
you
correctly
earlier,
under
recent
statutory
amendments
in
south
carolina
you
think
that
there
are
more
cases
in
which
the
alternative
to
death
will
be
life
with
parole
than
in
which
it
will
be
life
without
parole?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
parole
may
be
very
speculative
too
for
someone
committed...
who's
committed
a
horrible
crime
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
speculative.
