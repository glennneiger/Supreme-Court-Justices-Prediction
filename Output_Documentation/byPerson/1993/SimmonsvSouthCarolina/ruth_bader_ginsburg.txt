justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
were
allowed
to
tell
the
jury
in
your
argument
that
life
means
life,
you
wouldn't
have
a
constitutional
objection,
i
take
it.
your
argument
is
the
jury
must
be
told.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
does
it
require
the
judge
to
tell
them,
or...
the
judge
wouldn't
permit
you
to
tell
them
either,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
there
a
constitutional
distinction
that
requires
the
judge
be
the
one
to
say
it,
or
is
your
point
that
the
term
"life"
must
be
defined...
you
must
be
allowed
to
define
it
for
the
jury?
whether
counsel
does
it
or
the
court
does
it
is
not
a
constitutional
distinction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well.
because
the
jurors
came
in
and
asked
the
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bruck,
but
if
we're
talking
about
what
does
the
term
"life"
mean,
i
take
it
you're
saying
you
should
be
allowed,
or
the
judge
should
instruct
to
say
that
there
is
no
parole
in
this
case.
on
the
other
hand,
the
prosecutor
could
then
say
but
the
governor
has
certain
authority,
they
could
let
this
person
out,
or
that
the
law
could
change.
the
governor
in
south
carolina
does
not
have
that
authority.
if
he
did,
ramos
is
on
point,
i
think,
and
would,
under
the
eighth
amendment,
allow
that
instruction.
a
change
of
law
is
a
more
difficult
question,
but
for
the
purposes
of
our...
because
the
idea
that
the
law
could
change
is
sort
of
a
universal
solvent
in
which
the
entire
idea
of
guided
discretion
tends
to
disappear,
leaving
only
the
finality
of
death
as
the
only
guidepost.
but
even...
for
purposes
of
our
argument
today
and
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case,
even
the
fact
that...
if
the
judge
were
to
instruct
under
current
law,
or
subject
to
further
action
by
the
legislature,
i
don't
think
that
that
in
any
way
affects
our
submission
today.
the
state
didn't
want
to
get
a
fair
hearing
on
this
or
spell
out
or
clarify
the
definition
of
the
definition
of
life
imprisonment.
the
state
wanted
to
keep
the
jury
in
the
dark
and
the
state
was
successful
in
doing
exactly
that.
and
i
submit
that
under
the
due
process
clause
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
under
the
reliability
prong
of
this
court's
line
on
this
court's
eighth
amendment
cases,
and
we
also
submit
under
the
lockett-skipper
line
of
the
right
to
present
mitigating
evidence
and
to
have
mitigating
evidence
given
substantial
and
reasonable
weight
in
the
jury's
deliberations.
because
the
failure
to
define
the
life
imprisonment
punishment
rendered
almost
meaningless
the
defendant's
skipper
evidence,
his
good
behavior
in
prison
evidence.
what
difference
would
it
make
if
he's
only
going
to
be
in
prison
for
5
or
10
years?
we're
concerned
about
what
happens
what
he's
paroled.
and,
indeed,
the
fact
that
he's
a
good
inmate
might
actually,
to
the
jury,
make
it
more
likely
that
he'll
be
paroled
sooner
and
back
on
the
streets.
so
for
all
of
those
reasons,
we
submit
that
what
happened
here
cannot
be
squared
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
i
would
note
too
that
this
is,
in
terms
of
what
goes
on
around
the
country,
a
very
narrow
issue.
because
of
the
states
which
have
parole,
precious
few
of
them
try
to
put
this
sort
of
a
thumb
on
the
scales
for
death.
they
tell
the
jury
forthrightly,
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
states,
and
i
believe
it
goes
down
the
line
of
them,
that
if
life
means
life,
that
is
usually
part
of
the
sentencing
verdict
itself,
and
the
jury
is
not
left
in
the
dark
and
defendants
are
not
exposed
to
the
sort
of
unfairness
that
happened
in
this
case.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
very
well,
mr.
bruck.
mr.
harpootlian,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
it's
legally
irrelevant
that
there
are,
in
fact,
two
different
kinds
of
life
sentences,
life
with
parole
and
life
without
parole,
that
that's
legally
irrelevant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
--but
wasn't
that
determination
made
under...
in
a
much
different
context.
i
mean,
wasn't
the
original
reason
for
not
telling
the
jury
about
parole
eligibility
was
the
fear
that
juries
might
be
too
harsh
on
defendants,
either
to
convict
where
they
might
have
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
if
they
have
anything
to
do
with
sentencing,
to
ratchet
it
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
we're
switching
to...
lockett
is
a
different
issue.
but
the
initial
reason
for
not
telling
the
jury
about
parole
was
defendant
protective,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
were
some
limitations,
that
this
particular
defendant
would
not
be
eligible
for
furlough?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
this,
work
release,
parole,
he
wouldn't
be
eligible
for
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
would
be,
this
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
taking
law
plus
regulations
together.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
can't
say
"must"
because,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
most
states
that
have
life
without
parole
do
inform
the
jury
of
that.
and
as
i
understand
it,
they
don't
go
on
to
suggest
what
might
be
if
prison
regulations
were
this
way
or
that
way.
well,
of
course--
--so
it's
not...
it
can't
be
a
must.
