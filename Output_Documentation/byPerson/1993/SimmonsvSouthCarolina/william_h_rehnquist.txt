mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.--
--well,
mr.
bruck,
are
you
arguing
that
a
state
has
an
obligation
to
provide
a
truthful
answer
to
any
question
that
a
jury
may
ask?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
a
state
say
that
we're
not
going
to
answer
jury
questions
that
involve
collateral
matters
that
are
just
going
to
distract
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
juries
or
judges
in
south
carolina
impose
sentences
in
noncapital
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
must.
i
asked
do
juries
or
judges?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
supposing
that
in
a
noncapital
case
a
jury
comes
in
with
a
question
after
some
deliberation
and
they
want
to
know
what
the
sentence
is
for
this
offense
if
they
find
the
person
guilty,
is
a
state
obligated
to
furnish
that
information?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
jury
comes
in
with
a
question
after
deliberation
and
asks
in
what
prison
would
a
life
term
be
served?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
how
do
you
define
the
legal
definition
of
a
sentencing
alternative?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
a
state...
could
a
state...
could
the
prosecutor
produce
evidence
that
the
place
all
these
lifers
are
sent
is
really
not
a
very
well
built
prison
and
it
would
be
fairly
easy
to
break
out
of?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harpootlian.
mr.
bruck,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
