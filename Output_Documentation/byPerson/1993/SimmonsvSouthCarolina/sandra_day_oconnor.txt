mr.
bruck,
may
i
try
to
ask
what
it
is
exactly
you're
urging,
that
the
defendant
had
a
right
to
put
in
evidence
about
what
the
parole
system
law
meant
in
south
carolina?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
an
argument
that
the
defendant's
lawyer
should
have
been
allowed
to
argue
it
to
the
jury,
or
do
you
say
that
in
every
case
the
trial
court
should,
sua
sponte,
instruct
on
it?
i
don't
know
what
it
is
you're
really
asking
us
to
hold.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
your
request
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
harpootlian,
do
most
states
that
have
a
system
of
life
without
parole
tell
the
juries
that
it's
life
imprisonment
without
parole?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
my
understanding
that
most
states
that
have
adopted
a
life
imprisonment
without
parole
go
ahead
and
advise
juries
if
a
jury
is
sentencing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
it's
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
states
would
do
as
south
carolina
and
refuse
to
clarify
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
are?
