justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
talk
about
fair
play,
counsel,
you're
not
suggesting
that
if
this
statute,
in
fact,
said
all
you
have
to
know
is
that
you
have
a
gun
and
the
gun,
in
fact,
has
to
be
of
a
certain
type...
that
that's
what
this
statute
said,
that's
fair
play?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
was
thinking
what
you
said...
you're
interpreting
a
statute
and
you
say...
said
that
the
statute
requires
that
the
defendant
know
he
possessed
a
machinegun.
suppose...
so...
and
you're...
as
you
read
the
statute,
that's
what
it
says.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
statute,
in
fact,
said
defendant
must
know
he
has
a
gun,
the
gun
must
be
a
machinegun,
period,
that
that
would
be
fair
play,
that
you
wouldn't...
you're
not
raising
a
constitutional
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
believe
i
authored
that
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it
was
judge
silberman,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
believe
that
justice
thomas
concurred
in
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there's
an
ambiguity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't
congress
say
what
drugs
are
unlawful?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
isn't
this
case
more
like
the
drug
case,
particularly
the
balint
case,
than
it
is
like
the
food
stamps
case.
because
a
gun
is
a
dangerous
instrument.
nothing
dangerous
about
a
food
stamp.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
don't...
don't
some
drugs
have
lawful
uses
too?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
could
even
lawfully
possess
marijuana
in
connection
with
treatment
of
certain
forms
of
cancer,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
circuit
other
than...
any
circuit
other
than
the
d.c.
circuit
that
has
gone
for
the
defendant
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
couldn't
one
rank
this
gun,
based
on
the
defendant's
expert
testimony,
that
this
was
a
defect,
and
so
bracket
the
defective
gun
with
the
internal
modification,
rather
than
the
external
modification?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
that,
i
take
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
jury
must
be
instructed
as
to
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman,
remind
me
of
your
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
about
the
difference
between
drugs,
where
one
would
say
drugs
are
dangerous,
and
guns
where,
for
the
most
part,
congress
hasn't
regulated,
so
it's
only
a
special
category
that's
registered?
you
don't
have
the
same
kind
of
congressional
determination
of
dangerousness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
court
that
makes
the
distinction
between
internal
and
external.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
which
we
don't
have
here,
because
whatever
you
call
it,
it
was
external.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
saying
that
this
case
fits
within
the,
"you
can't
see
it;
it's
all
on
the
inside.
"
