justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
they
say
that
in
our
drug
laws?
i
mean,
you
know,
possession
of
heroin
and
so
forth?
do
they
say
knowing
that
it...
knowing
that
it
is
heroin?
do
those
statutes
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
your
point
machineguns
or
is
your
point
semiautomatic
rifles?
justice
antonin
scalia
which,
due
to
some
defect,
may
turn
into
machineguns,
which
is
what
you...
what
you
say
is
the
situation
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
are
many
more
than
140,000
semiautomatic
rifles.
justice
antonin
scalia
many
hunters
use
semiautomatics
all
the
time.
it
just
means
you
don't
have
to
reload
each
time
you
fire
one
round.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
a
pistol...
would
a
pistol
that
had
that
defect
become...
would
an
automatic
pistol
that
had
that
defect
become
a
machinegun?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
semiautomatic
pistol?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
fires
more
than
one
round
with
a
pull,
it
doesn't
matter
how
long
the
barrel
is,
it
becomes
a
machinegun.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
quite
accurate.
this
didn't...
this
wasn't
really
a
semiautomatic
weapon.
it
was
an
automatic
weapon
that
had
been
rendered
semiautomatic,
and
that
because
of
a
defect
became
automatic
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
this
weapon
an
automatic
weapon
as
originally
designed,
and
it
had
been
modified
to
prevent
the
automatic
feature
of
it
from
operating?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feldman,
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
this
statute
says
that
it's
to
be
interpreted
like
the
narcotic
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
narcotics
are
different
from...
from
a
semiautomatic
rifle,
which
are
very
common.
justice
antonin
scalia
narcotics
may
not
be
different
from
a
machinegun
that
looks
like
a
machinegun.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
something
when,
you
know,
you're
presented
with
it,
you
say,
gee,
this
is
a
machinegun,
what's
this
doing
around
here.
or
if
you're
presented
with
narcotics,
the
same
thing,
you
ought
to
notice
right
away.
but
when
you...
when
you're...
when
you
say
a
semiautomatic
rifle,
hunters
use
them
throughout
the
country.
it's
no
big
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feldman,
can
i
ask
what
the
government's
theory
of
mens
rea
requirement
is?
you're
certainly
not
asserting
that
we
should
read
every
federal
statute
which
does
not
explicitly
have
a
knowledge
requirement
as
dispensing
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
ordinarily,
we
will
read
in
a
requirement
that
you
have
to
know
you're
violating
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what...
what
makes
this
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
registration
and
recordkeeping
requirements
do
not
have
a
scienter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
meant...
i
meant
the
former.
the
chief
justice
is
quite
correct
to
make
that
modification.
but
in
this
case,
that
would
lead
to
the
normal
requirement
that
he
had
to
know
the
fact
that
it
was
a
machinegun.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that's
not
the
case
here
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--machineguns
are
dangerous
and
this
act
looks
like
another
act
that
we've
held
doesn't
have
a
recordkeeping
requirement,
and
this
is
a...
doesn't
have
such
a
requirement.
and
lastly,
this...
this
act
is
a
recordkeeping
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
--what
if...
what
if
you
don't
even
know
that
it's
a
shotgun,
you
don't
even
know
you
have
a
shotgun?
you
buy
a
house,
wight,
and
sealed
up
in
an
abandoned
room
in
the
basement
there
is
a
sawed-off
shotgun;
would
you
be
liable?
you
don't
have
to
know
anything
at
all?
you
don't
even
have
to
know
you
possess
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
way
the
drug
law
is
interpreted
too,
that
you
appeal
to?
if
i
sell
something
that
i
think
is
face
powder
and
it
turns
out
to
heroin,
that
what
they
said
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
if
you're
going
to
appeal
to
bailant
and
the
drug
cases,
you
have
to
say
it
really
doesn't
even
matter
whether
he
knows
it's...
it's
a...
he
owns
a
gun.
