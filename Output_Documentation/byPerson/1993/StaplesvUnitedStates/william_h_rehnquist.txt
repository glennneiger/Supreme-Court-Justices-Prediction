we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-1441,
harold
e.
staples
v.
the
united
states.
ms.
de
angelis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed,
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
feldman,
does
the
government
want
to
concede
that
you
ordinarily
read
in
a
requirement
that
you
must
know
you're
violating
the
law
in
every
criminal
statute
where
congress
is
silent?
isn't
the
presumption
ordinarily
that
ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
defense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
it's...
then,
it
seems
to
me,
you're
giving
a
different
answer
to
me
than
you
gave
to
justice
scalia
a
moment
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
a
different...
it's
one
thing
to
say
the
defendant
must
know
the
facts
that
make
his
conduct
illegal.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
he
must
know
the
law
that
makes
them
illegal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
ms.
de
angelis,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
de
angelis.
the
case
is
submitted.
