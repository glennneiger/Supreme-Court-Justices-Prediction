92-1441,
staples
versus
united
states.
this
case
is
before
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
section
5861(d)
of
the
national
firearms
act
makes
it
a
crime
to
possess
a
machinegun
that
has
not
been
registered
with
the
federal
government.
a
machinegun
is
defined
as
a
weapon
that
shoots
more
than
one
shot
with
a
single
pull
of
the
trigger.
petitioner
was
charged
with
violating
section
5861(d)
after
it
was
discovered
that
a
semi
automatic
rifle
in
his
possession
that
is
a
rifle
that
will
fire
only
one
shot
with
each
pull
of
the
trigger
have
been
converted
to
fire
fully
automatically.
at
trial,
petitioner
testified
that
he
believed
that
the
rifle
would
fire
only
one
shot
with
each
pull
of
the
trigger
and
he
asked
the
district
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
to
establish
the
elements
of
the
offense
under
section
5861(d),
the
government
was
required
to
prove
that
he
knew
the
weapon
would
fire
fully
automatically.
the
district
court
declined
to
give
that
instruction.
petitioner
was
convicted
and
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
the
conviction.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
to
obtain
a
conviction
under
section
5861(d),
the
government
should
have
been
required
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
petitioner
knew
that
the
rifle
had
the
characteristics
that
brought
it
within
the
statutory
definition
of
a
machinegun.
while
section
5861(d)
itself
was
silent
concerning
the
mens
rea
element
required
for
a
conviction.
we
must
construe
the
statute
in
light
of
the
background
assumption
of
the
common
law
that
mens
rea
is
required
for
every
crime,
and
traditionally
at
common
law,
the
mens
rea
necessary
for
a
criminal
conviction
required
that
an
accused
at
least
know
the
facts
the
made
his
conduct
illegal,
here
that
would
require
the
petitioner
to
have
known
that
his
rifle
could
fire
fully
automatically.
it
is
true
that
in
some
cases
concerning
so-called
"public
welfare"
offenses
we
have
understood
some
criminal
statutes
to
dispense
with
the
requirement
that
the
defendant
know
the
facts
that
bring
his
conduct
within
the
scope
of
statute.
the
statutes
we
have
interpreted
in
that
fashion,
however,
typically
deal
with
the
regulation
of
harmful
or
injurious
items
or
as
we
described
them
in
one
case
dangerous
or
deleterious
devices
or
products
or
obnoxious
waste
materials.
when
dealing
with
such
statute,
we
have
reasoned
that
as
long
as
a
defendant
knows
generally
that
he
is
dealing
with
a
dangerous
item
that
places
him
in
responsible
relation
to
public
danger
he
should
be
alerted
to
the
probability
of
strict
regulation.
we
have
concluded
that
the
defendant
need
not
know
that
he
has
a
precise
item
regulated
by
the
statute
in
order
to
be
convicted
for
violating
the
statutes
commands.
in
this
case,
section
5861(d)
does
not
define
such
a
public
welfare
offense.
guns
are
not
obnoxious
or
deleterious
items
as
we
have
understood
those
terms
in
the
past.
there
is
a
longstanding
tradition
of
widespread
lawful
gun
ownership
in
this
country
and
we
cannot
say
that
a
person
who
merely
possesses
the
gun
knows
what
he
stands
in
responsible
relation
to
a
public
danger
such
that
he
should
be
subjected
to
criminal
sanctions
because
the
items
in
his
possession
turns
out
to
be
subject
to
regulations
under
the
national
firearms
act.
if
congress
had
intended
to
subject
the
gun
owners
to
criminal
penalties
when
they
only
knew
that
they
possess
lawful
items,
we
think
congress
should
have
spoken
more
clearly
to
that
effect.
