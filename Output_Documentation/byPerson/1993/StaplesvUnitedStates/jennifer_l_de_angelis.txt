ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client,
harold
e.
staples,
was
convicted
of
knowing
possession
of
a
machinegun
not
registered
to
him,
in
violation
of
26
u.s.c.
section
5861(d).
my
client
is
asking
this
court
to
reverse
this
conviction
and
remand
this
case
for
a
new
trial,
a
fair
trial.
the
defendant
respectfully
contends
that
the
first
trial
was
not
fair.
it
was
not
fair
because
the
jury
was
prohibited
by
the
jury
instructions
presented
to
consider
whether
or
not
mr.
staples
knew
the
sport
rifle
he
possessed
was,
in
fact,
a
machinegun.
as
stated
by
justice
ebel
in
his
concurring
opinion,
printed
at
page
24a
of
the
petition
for
cert
in
this
case,
whether
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
an
innocent
victim
is
an
open
question
because
the
jury
was
precluded
from
considering
his
knowledge
of
the
gun's
capabilities.
principles
of
justice
and
fair
play
suggest
that
we
let
the
jury
decide
whether
the
defendant
possessed
an
automatic
weapon.
prior
to
this
criminal
prosecution,
the
citizen
before
this
court
had
no
prior
criminal
record,
was
engaged
in
no
unlawful
activity,
certainly
engaged
in
no
unlawful
activity
in
connection
with
this
gun.
and
by
all
accounts--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--certainly,
he
did
not.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
prior
to
this
criminal
prosecution.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
mr.
staples
believed
what
he
possessed...
possessed
what
he
believed
to
be...
and
the
undisputed
evidence,
testimony
of
three
other
witnesses
at
trial,
was
that
this
legal
semiautomatic
weapon,
operated
only
in
semiautomatic
mode
prior
to
government
seizure
and
test
fire
in
january
of
1990--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--excuse
me.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
justice
o'connor,
i
would
disagree
to
the
extent
that
the
jury
was
precluded
from
considering
whether
or
not
the
weapon
was
a
machinegun.
because
of
the
nature
of
the
instruction,
all
the
jury
had
to
find
was
that
the
defendant
possessed
a
device
that
was
dangerous,
and
that
dangerous
device
was
likely
to
be
subject
to
regulation.
that's
not
the
same
as--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--they
had
to
find
it
was
a
firearm,
and
technically--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
there
are--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--when
the
trigger
was
pulled
on
this
gun,
the
weapon
fired
multiple
shots
with
a
single
trigger
pull.
if
what
you're
saying,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
constitutes
a
machinegun,
then
i
would
have
to
agree
with
your
analysis
of
the
tenth
circuit
opinion.
however,
how--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--that's
correct.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
there
are
approximately
70
million
law
abiding
gun
owners
in
this
country
who
congress
has
consistently
sought
to
protect.
the
protection
of
hunters
and
sportsmen
is
codified
in
section
101
of
the
gun
control
act,
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
39.
of
the
70
million
law
abiding
gun
owners,
a
large
percentage
of
them
own
semiautomatic
guns
purchased
lawfully,
just
like
mr.
staples,
at
a
public
gun
show
authorized
by
18
u.s.c.
923,
subsection
(j).
in
the
record,
and
throughout
the
case
law,
there
are
cited
numerous
instances
where
truly
innocent
possessors
of
semiautomatic
rifles
may
be
convicted
of
knowing
possession
of
a
machinegun.
for
example,
at
trial
of
this
case,
judge
cook
expressly,
repeatedly
showed
concern
about
people
who
may
be
out
duck
hunting
and
their
sport
rifle
may
double
by
accident,
without
any
prior
indication
that
it
had
such
capability,
and
that
doubling
would
result
in
conviction
under
the
strict
liability
interpretation
of
26
u.s.c.
section
5861
(d).
under
these
circumstances,
judge
cook
said,
it
violates
our
system
of
fair
play,
but
he
assumed
that
people
wouldn't
be
prosecuted.
perhaps
the
best
example
is
cited
by
judge
ebel
in
the
concurring
opinion
printed
at
page
24a...
excuse
me,
23a
of
the
petition
for
cert.
consider,
for
example,
a
situation
in
which
a
person
who
knows
nothing
about
guns
inherits
a
rifle
from
a
relative.
unbeknownst
to
the
recipient,
the
gun
is
defective,
occasionally
discharges
two
rounds
of
ammunition,
and
after
a
single
pull
of
the
trigger,
or
perhaps
it's
been
converted
by
a
prior
owner
to
an
automatic
weapon.
because
he
has
no
use
for
the
rifle,
the
recipient
stores
it
with
other
unnecessary
possessions
in
the
basement
or
attic,
without
ever
having
used
it
or
examined
it.
under
the
strict
liability
theory,
he
would
be
prosecuted
and
sentenced.
the
penalties
which
accompany
conviction
for
violation
of
6
u.s.c.
2561(d)
are
harsh:
10
years
imprisonment,
$10,000
fine,
or
both.
for--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--justice
ginsburg,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
understanding
your
question.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
that's
correct.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
no.
and
also
i
would
direct...
justice
ginsburg,
as
you
well
know,
in
the
u.s.
v.
harris
decision
decided
by
the
d.c.
circuit
which
you
authored,
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
right,
you're
correct.
i
stand
corrected.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
that's
correct.
as
well,
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
to
apply
a
scienter
element
into
the
criminal
offenses.
however,
what
the
courts
have
done
in
recent
history
is
they
have
used
tools
of
statutory
construction,
and
the
rule
of
lenity,
to
find
that--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--if
there...
that's
correct.
if
there
is
an
ambiguous
statute,
then
principles
of
fundamental
criminal
law
mandate
that
the
government
prove
mens
rea.
support
for
the
application
of
rule
of
lenity
stated
that...
in
this
case
particularly,
and
the
harris
decision,
that
if
congress,
against
the
background
of
widespread
lawful
gun
ownership,
wished
to
criminalize
the
mere
possession
of
an
unregistered
possess...
machine...
excuse
me,
firearm,
often
indistinguishable
from
other
nonprohibitive
types,
it
would
have
clearly
stated
to
that
effect.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
no.
those
are,
for
the
most
part...
and
i
must
tell
you
i'm
not
familiar
with
every
single
one
of
the
controlled
substances
statutes,
but
they
would...
most
of
them
do
require
strict
liability.
however,
the
difference
between
a
controlled
narcotic
or
sulfuric
acid
or
other
substances
of
that
nature,
is
it
doesn't
have
the
support
of
the
constitution.
there
is
a
second...
second
amendment
right
to
bear
arms,
and
for
that
reason
congress
has
chosen
time
and
time
again
to
protect
that
right
and
distinguish
what
firearms
need
to
be
registered
intact
and
what
firearms
may
be
legally
owned
and
possessed.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
yes,
certainly
they
do.
they...
they're
regulated.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg.
there's
nothing
dangerous,
necessarily
about
a
gin...
about
a
food
stamp.
however,
what
you
have
before
you
is
a...
is
a
weapon
that
is
legal,
that
has
legal
uses
and
legal
possession.
food
stamps
also
have
legal
uses
and
legal
possession,
and
you
stand
the
risk
of
criminalizing
innocent
behavior,
innocent
possessors,
by
not
implying
knowledge
requirements--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--certainly,
prescription
drugs,
or...
if
that's
what
the
justice
is
referring
to.
however--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--that
is...
that
is
correct.
however,
the
distinction
here...
again,
those
exceptions
have
been
noted.
for
example,
we
know
that
this
court's
rendered
decisions...
i
haven't
reviewed
them
recently...
dealing
with
spiritual
uses
for
marijuana,
or
other
narcotics,
to
allow
that
freedom
to
exist,
just
as
there
is
a
freedom
here
to
bear
arms,
and
a
right
to
bear
arms,
and
legal
uses
for
a
sport
rifle.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
only
in
that
it
allowed
congress...
it
supports
a
constitutional
basis
to
allow
congress...
which
congress
has
relied
on,
let
me
rephrase
that.
it
provides
a
constitutional
basis
which
congress
has
relied
on
to
protect
legitimate,
law
abiding
uses
for
sport
rifles
and
target
practice,
or
hunting
or
duck
hunting,
or
whatever
the
use
may
be.
there
is
a
right
to
bear
arms.
it's
not
something
that's--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--exactly,
that's
correct.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
no.
what
we
have
before
this
court
is
just
a
citizen.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
there
are
approximately,
my
understanding
would
be,
about
140,000
registered
machineguns.
i
understand
they
are
used
in
competitions--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
stand
before
this
court
to
be
a
firearms
expert,
but
i
do
believe
that
there
are
competitions
involving
machineguns,
and
there
are
other...
are
other
uses
for
them.
those
of
which
were
lawfully
registered
prior
to
the
ban
of
1986,
i
don't
know
what--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--this
case--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
that's
right,
there--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--that's
right.
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
case
is
about.
the
semiautomatic
weapon
in
this
case
is
a
sport
rifle.
there
are--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--you
mean
a
semiautomatic
pistol?
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
it's
my
understanding
that
any
semiautomatic
pistol,
sport
rifle,
shotgun,
has
the
capability--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--if
it
fires
more
than
one
shot
with
a
single
pull
of
the
trigger,
it
becomes
a
machinegun
under
the
strict
liability
theory.
that
was
the...
that's
the
concern
in
most
of
the
courts
that
have
implied
a
knowledge
requirement
in
the
26
5861(d).
and
this
case
is...
involves
a
semiautomatic
sport
rifle,
as
any
semiautomatic
gun
can
be
converted
into
an
automatic
or
can,
by
malfunction,
as
did
this
gun,
perform
with...
produce
multiple
shots
with
a
single
pull.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
i--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--if
you're
referring
to
the
stop
on
the
switch--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--the...
when
this...
the
testimony
at
trial
has
been
consistently,
from
the
seller
all
the
way
through,
of
this
ar-15
sport
rifle,
as
of
when
my
client
purchased
it
at
the
gun
show,
it
was
manufactured
with
m-16
internal
parts.
the
selector
switch
on
the
outside
had
a
three
position
lever
that
allows
it
to
go
from
safe
to
semi
to
auto,
and
there
was
a
stop
on
that
to
prevent
it
from
semi
to
auto.
the
court
should
know...
and
it
is
printed
in
the
transcript
and
in
the
briefs...
that
there
are
ar-15
sport
rifles
out
there,
and
other
semiautomatic
guns
out
there,
that
have
no
stop
at
all,
nothing
to
prevent
the
user
from
turning
the
lever
from
the
semi
to
the
auto.
however,
the
turning
of
that
lever--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--well,
with
one
exception.
and
that
is
even
if
you
turn
the
lever,
that
in
and
of
itself,
in
this
gun,
will
not
allow
the
gun
to
produce
multiple
shots.
you
have
to
have
the
malfunction--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--you
are
correct,
primarily
because
at
trial--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--that's
correct.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
that's
correct.
it
was
not
designed--
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
--that's
correct.
it's
not
designed
to
shoot
multiple
shots
with
a
single
pull
of
the
trigger.
and
interestingly
enough,
the
testimony
at
trial
from
the
expert,
mr.
fagg,
in
this
case,
was
that
this
is
not
a
weapon,
for
example,
that
you
would
want
to
sell
to
the
military
and
represent
was
an
m-16.
it's
not
a
weapon,
by
the
government's
expert's
own
concession,
that
would
reliably
fire
multiple
shots
with
a
single
pull
of
the
trigger.
interestingly
enough,
on
page
16
of
the
government's
brief
they
make
the
following
statement:
"in
cases
in
which
the
offense
involves
regulation
of
an
item
that
would
not
ordinarily
be
considered
a
hazard
to
the
community,
a
rigorously
knowledge
element
may
be
implied.
"
the
rationale
that
all
parties
agree
for
the
implication
of
a
knowledge
requirement
is
that
any
other
result
would
risk
criminalizing
a
broad
range
of
innocent
conduct,
just
as
we
were
discussing
earlier
in
the
liparota
decision.
certainly,
i
would
not
represent
to
this
court
that
guns
are
always
safe.
but
congress
has
repeatedly
and
deliberately
chosen
only
to
register
and
tax
those
guns
which
are
considered
to
be
highly
dangerous
and
offensive
firearms.
the
government
says
that
congress
wants
to
prevent
the
conversion
of
semiautomatic
weapons
to
automatic
weapons.
the
petitioner
does
not
disagree
necessarily
with
that
statement.
however,
that
assumes
some
knowledge
or
purposeful
act
on
the
part
of
a
person,
just
as
in
the
mittleider
decision
rendered
by
the
tenth
circuit.
defendant
mittleider
sold
his
semiautomatic
with
a
conversion
kit
to
a
undercover
officer.
the
conversion
kit
for
this
ar-15
is
called
an
auto-sear.
it's
a
very
small
part
whose
only
function
is
to
allow
the
gun
to
fire
automatically
more
than
one
shot
with
a
single
pull
of
the
trigger.
conversion
of
the
gun
cannot
be
accomplished
reliably
or
purposefully
without
the
auto-sear.
because
the
criminal
offenses
requiring
no
mens
rea
have
a
generally
disfavored
status,
petitioner
respectfully
requests
this
court
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
in
this
case.
throughout
their
brief,
the
government
alludes
to
gangsters
and
criminals
in
connection
with
gun
possession.
the
petitioner
is
not
a
criminal,
other
than
this
conviction,
and
has
no
prior
criminal
record,
nor
does
he
advocate
widespread
use
of
machineguns.
petitioner
does
advocate
fairness,
however,
in
prosecution,
and
strongly
believes
that
this
honorable
court
and
the
congress
and
the
constitution
promote
justice
and
fair
play
by
providing
citizens
with
notice
of
what
conduct
is
unlawful
and
to
prove
that
the
defendant
had
knowledge
of
his
unlawful
conduct.
to
allow
26
section
5861(d)
to
be
a
strict
liability
crime
invites
random
prosecution.
the
only
support
for
this
prosecution
is
an
ambiguous
statute
that
omits
a
critical
element
of
fundamental
and
criminal
jurisprudence,
and
that
is
the
defendant's
mens
rea.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
important
for
this
court
to
remember
that
not
all
guns
are
taxed
and
regulated.
and
as
with
regard
to
the
congressional
intent,
i'd
like
to
leave
the
court
with
this
thought
from
the
anderson
decision
in
the
fifth
circuit:
"it
is
unthinkable
to
us
that
the
congress
intended
to
subject
such
law-abiding,
well-intentioned
citizens
to
a
possible
10-year
term
of
imprisonment
if,
unknown
to
them,
without
reasonable
cause
on
their
part
to
think
otherwise,
what
they
genuinely
and
reasonably
believed
was
a
conventional
semiautomatic
pistol
turns
out
to
have
been
worn
down
or
secretly
modified
to
be
fully
automatic.
"
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
that's
right.
ms.
jennifer
l.
de
angelis
in
part,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
the
government
has
stated,
even
in
pretrial
proceedings,
that
the
modifications
in
this
case
were
twofold.
one,
it
contained
m-16
parts.
the
government
says
the
parts
were
substituted.
that
was
not
the
evidence
at
trial.
the
evidence
was
it
was
purchased
by
mr.
staples
with
m-16
parts;
it
was
manufactured
in
that
fashion.
and
one
of
those
parts
was
the
selector
stop
on
the
lever...
and
the
switch,
the
stop
being
modified
or
filed
or
worn
down
in
some
fashion
by
someone
at
some
time.
