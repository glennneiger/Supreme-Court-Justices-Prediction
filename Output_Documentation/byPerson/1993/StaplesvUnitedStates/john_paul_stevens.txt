justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
certainly
he
did
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
jury
thought
otherwise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunder...
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
quite
understand
what
the
second
amendment
has
to
do
with
the
case.
would
you
explain
that
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
militia
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is.
but
is
this
part
of
somebody's
militia,
this
machinegun?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
mentioned
earlier
about
the
lawful
uses
of
articles
of
this
kind.
what
is
the
primary
lawful
use
of
a
machinegun?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
but
i'm
just
asking
you.
i
just
don't
happen
to
know.
what
is
the
primary
lawful
use?
why
would
one
not
think,
getting
a
machinegun,
that
there
might
be
a
reason
to
check
as
to
whether
there's
any
reason
to
have
it
registered
and
so
forth?
why
is
it...
is
it
so
commonly
used,
like
an
automobile
or
something
like
that?
isn't
that
the
kind
of
article
that
would
put
you
on
notice
that
if
you
want
to
use
it
in...
that
you
ought
to
check
and
be
sure
the
use
is
lawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
true
that
all
the
courts
of
appeals
have
done
that.
at
least...
at
least
they
have
to
know
that
he
possessed
the
item.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
happen
to
know,
as
a
matter
of
history,
what
precipitated
the
enactment
of
the
'34
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
live
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
didn't
live
in
chicago
then,
i
guess.
