justice
david
h.
souter
in
which
case
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument,
if
your
client
had
bought
one
of
those.
justice
david
h.
souter
no
i
realize
that.
but
if
your
client
had
bought
one
of
the
guns
in
which
there
was
a
third
position
and
all
the
client
had
to
do
was
to
put
the
device
in
the
third
position,
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
same
argument
that
you're
making
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was,
except
that
in
the
narcotics
example,
i
suppose
it's
true
to
say
that
congress
did
not
draw
a
line
between...
sort
of
down
the
middle
in
the
class
of
dangerous
narcotics
and
say,
well,
we'll...
we'll
prohibit
or
regulate
some
and
leave
others
free.
but
that,
in
effect,
is
what
has
happened
in
the
gun
situation.
i
mean,
after
all,
the
brady
bill
didn't
pass
until
last
week.
i
mean,
there's
just
been
a
long
history
of
refusal
to
regulate
the
major
class
of
guns
in
this
country,
so
that
when
you
are
faced
with
something
that,
so
far
as
externals
are
concerned,
looks
perfectly
well
like
a
gun
which
is
unregulated
and
which
has
been
the
subject
of
repeated
decisions
not
to
regulate,
you're
not
in
the
same
situation
that
you're
in
with
the
narcotics.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
still...
i
guess
maybe
i'm
going
to
move
aside
a
little
bit
from
the...
from
attacking
the
historical
analogy,
and
just
go
to
the
merits
of
applying
the
interpretive
rule
here.
given
the
fact
that
the...
that
the
overwhelming
number
of
guns
in
this
country,
all
of
which
are
dangerous
to
some
degree,
are
not
regulated,
i
have
difficulty
in
seeing
the
ease
of
applying
this
rule
that
one
simply
is
on
notice
that
there
may
be
regulation
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
one
has
a
weapon
which,
by
definition,
is
dangerous.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
just
on
the
analytical
point,
i
think
you've
got
a
hurdle
to
jump
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
the...
does
the
argument,
then,
in
this
case,
come
down
to
the
fact
that
if
you're
dealing
with
a
machinegun,
that's
fair
to
say,
something
which
is
manufactured
as
a
machinegun,
sold
as
a
machinegun,
anyone
sort
of
buying
it
could
reasonably
be
assumed...
or
possessing
it,
could
reasonably
be
assumed
to
know
that
it
was
a
machinegun,
but
that
the
argument
doesn't
wash
in
the
case
of
a
gun
which,
at
least
to
external
appearances,
is
not
a
machinegun.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
this
act,
that
it
falls
within
this
very
dangerous
category
of
regulated
weapons.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
we've
got
a
category
of
dangerous
weapons
which
are
not
regulated.
presumably,
there's
nothing
about
the
possession
of
a
singleshot
22
that
ought
to
put
the
owner
on...
to
an
obligation
of
calling
the
government
to
see
whether
they
regulate
singleshot
22's.
when
the
person
possesses
or
buys
a
machinegun
pure
and
simple,
yes,
you
get
a
pretty
strong
argument
that
it's
fair
to
put
that
obligation
on
him.
then
we
have
the
middle
category
of
guns
which
maybe
can
be
converted,
and
which
in
most
cases
are
not.
and
is
it...
is
it
appropriate
to
put
the
obligation
on
the
possessor
or
the
buyer
of
those
weapons
to
see
whether
something,
in
fact,
has...
has
been
modified
about
them
that
puts
them
into
the
especially
dangerous
regulable
category?
and
that's
the
issue
we've
got.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
may
have...
they
may
have
done
that
on
the
assumption
that
we
were
going
to
apply
this
rule,
which
we're
having
difficulty
applying,
or
at
least
i'm
having
difficulty
applying.
congress
many
have
said,
well...
you
know,
in
fact
congress
frequently
does
this...
you
know,
the
courts
will
work
it
out,
they'll
figure
out
what
to
do
here.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can
infer
much
from
congress'
failure
to
act
positively
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
while
keeping...
while
keeping
their
silence
on
mens
rea.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
i
think...
i
guess
what's...
i
guess
what's
bothering
me
is
that
i
don't
see
in
the
drug
situation
an
analogy
to
this
fact
about
the
gun
situation:
in
the
gun
situation,
there
has
been
a
continuing
political
contest
for
further
back
than
i
can
tell,
about
the
appropriateness
of
regulating
guns.
and
congress,
by
and
large,
has
taken
a
very
narrow
view
of
what
should
be
regulated.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
fact
which
makes
it
difficult
to
apply,
sort
of,
your
tough
version
of
the
rule.
and
i
don't
see
any
analogy
there
in
the
drug
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
the
jury
instructed
on
the...
on
a
defensive
defect
here?
i
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
jury
rejected
the
theory
that,
in
fact,
this
was
a
merely
defective
gun,
and
i
didn't...
i
didn't
understand
that
that
issue
was
put
to
the
jury.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
fact,
i
don't...
as
i
understood
the
instructions,
the
jury
wouldn't
have
had
any
occasion
even
to
take
that
issue
up.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
under
that
definition,
as
i
understand
the
instructions,
if
the
jury
found
that
on
one
occasion
one
pull
of
the
trigger
shot
more
than
one
round,
that
that...
that
would
qualify
as
a
machinegun.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
jury
was
not
instructed,
as
i
understand
it,
that
in...
in
the
generality
of
cases
this
particular
gun
had
to
function
in
that
way.
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
not
instructed
that
if
it
did
so
as
a
result
of
a
defect,
that
it
was
not
a
machinegun.
am
i
wrong
about
the
instructions?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
we
can't...
we
can't
say
that
the
jury
rejected
the
theory
of
defect
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
agree
with
you,
but
that's
not...
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
is
did
it
reject
a
theory
of
defective
weapon
such
that
if
it
had
found
it
was
merely
defective,
that
would
have
been
defensive.
and
the
jury
didn't
reject
that
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
not
addressing
the
court
of
appeals,
i'm
just
addressing
your
argument,
and
you
were
making
the
argument
a
moment
ago
that
the
jury
had
rejected
the
theory
of
defect,
and
i
don't
see
how
it
did...
you
can
make
that
argument
based
on
the
instructions.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
regardless--
justice
david
h.
souter
--regardless
of
what
the
theory
of
defect
is,
the
jury
did
not
reject
a
theory
of
defect.
isn't
that
fair
to
say,
under
the
jury
instructions
as
given?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
doing...
you're
doing
a
good
job.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
fair
to
say...
we
could
argue
about
the
facts
of
application,
but
is
it
fair
to
say
that
your
interpret...
the
government's
interpretative
rule
for
finding
what
congress
probably
intended,
or
imputing
an
intent
to
congress,
does
require,
for
your
position
to
prevail,
that
we
conclude
that
the...
that
the...
that
the
defendant
understand
that
what
he
was
possessing
was...
was
an
object
within
a
class
of
highly
dangerous
objects
which
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
the
government
would
regulate?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
general
premise?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
