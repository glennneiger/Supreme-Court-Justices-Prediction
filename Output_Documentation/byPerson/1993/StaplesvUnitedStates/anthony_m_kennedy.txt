justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
it
were
shown
that
this
defendant
knew
of...
of
that
capability,
of
that
operational
feature,
then
there
wouldn't
be
really
a
case
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question.
in
the
form
that
this
came
from
the
manufacturer,
and
if
it
was
operating
properly,
without
any
defect,
would...
it
would
be
semiautomatic
only,
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
was
not
manufactured
as
a
machinegun
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
only
if
there's
a
defect
does
it
become...
does
it
acquire
that
characteristic.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course--
--mr.
feldman--
--under
your
position,
even
if
it's
defective,
there's
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
it
a
question
of
law
as
to
what
is
a
machinegun
and
what
isn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
your
position
that
a
defective
firearm
that
fires
multiple
rounds
is
or
is
not
a
machinegun?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
where
you're
reading
from,
please?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
government's
position
is
that
unless--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
the
government's
position
is
that
there's
a
machinegun
involved
if
it
shoots
most
of
the
time
or
some
of
the
time
as
fully
automatic?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
isn't
that
an
argument
for
requiring
specific
knowledge
of
its
characteristics,
as
opposed
to
strict
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
we've
just
stumbled
onto
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
most
recordkeeping
acts
have
prison
sanctions
for
up
to
10
years,
which
is
what
this
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
implicit
in
the
argument
that
it's
a
registration,
a
regulatory
act,
is
also
the
assumption
that
the
penalty
is...
is
not
too
severe.
this
is
a
very
severe
penalty.
