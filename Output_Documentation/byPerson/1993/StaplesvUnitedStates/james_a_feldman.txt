mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
our
position
that
the
jury
was
properly
instructed
in
this
case,
and
that
petitioner's
conviction,
accordingly,
should
be
affirmed.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
in
order
to
convict
petitioner,
it
had
to
find
that
he
possessed
a
machinegun
and
that
he
knew
he
possessed
a
dangerous
device
of
a
type
as
would
alert
one
to
the
likelihood
of
regulation.
it's
our
position
that
that
is
sufficient
for
a
conviction
under
section
5861(d)
and
that
the
court
properly
rejected
petitioner's
proposed
instruction
that
would
have
required
the
jury
to
find
that
he
knew
that
the
weapon
he
possessed
had
all
of
the
characteristics,
including
the
ability
to
fire
automatically,
that
subject
it
to
regulation
under
the
national
firearms
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
there's
a
military--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--at
least...
yes,
yes.
there's
a
military
weapon
which
is
an
m-16.
it's
a
selective
fire
weapon
that
has
a
switch
that
you
can
turn
to
automatic,
semiautomatic,
or,
i
think,
safety.
this--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
of
course,
that...
that...
there
have
been
courts
which
have
distinguished
between
cases
where
the
modification
was
entirely
external...
was
entirely
internal,
and
where
there
was
some
external
modification.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
in
our
view--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
that's
correct.
just
as...
that's
correct.
the
congress'
intent
when
it
enacted
the
national
firearms
act...
well,
when
congress
enacted
the
national
firearms
act
in
1934,
it
made
it
a
crime
to
possess
a
machinegun
that's
not
registered
in
the
national
registration
records.
it
modeled
the
statute...
it
specifically
stated
that
it
modeled
the
statute
on
the
harrison
narcotics
act
of
1914.
this
court
had...
which
imposed
a
similar
registration/recordkeeping
requirement
on
opiates
and
cocaine.
in
the
united
states
against
bailant
in
1922,
this
court
held
that
that
statute
does
not
require
the
government
to
prove
that
the
defendant
has
the
kind
of
knowledge
that
petitioner
argues
must
be
proven
in
this
case.
that
in...
that
under...
under
bailant,
under
the
national...
under
the
harrison
narcotics
act,
it's
not
necessary
to
show
that
the
defendant
knows
that
the
drugs
he
possessed
had
the
characteristics
of
opium
or
opiates
or
cocaine.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
it
doesn't
say
that.
if
you
look
at
the
provision...
if
you
set
it...
if
you
set
the
original
1934
statute
alongside
the
narcotics
act,
the
similarities
are
striking.
the
penalty
provision
is
identical.
a
lot
of
the
language
is
the
same.
but
i
think
equally
important,
the
attorney
general
cummings
who
drafted...
who
had
a
role
in
drafting
the
statute,
stated
that
he
modeled
it
on
the
harrison
narcotics
act,
and
the
committee
reports
stated
we
have
modeled
this
on
the
harrison
narcotics
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
true.
narcotics
are
different,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
true,
and...
but
i
think
the
same
thing
would
have
been
true
of
drugs
at
the
time
they
enacted
the
harrison
narcotics
act.
in
other
words,
the
court
didn't
say
that
what...
the
burden
of
the
court's
decision
in
bailant
was
that
if
you
possess
drugs
and
you
didn't
know
that
those
drugs
were
opium
or...
opiates
or
cocaine,
you
could
still
be
prosecuted
under
the
act.
and
the
reason
that
the
court
reached
that
conclusion,
and
the
reason
that
congress
intended
that,
and
the
reason
that
they
didn't
put
a
mens
rea
provision
in
the
statute
here,
is
that
those...
that
drugs,
as
a
general
category
of
items,
like
firearms,
can
pose
a
very
severe
threat
to
the
community.
that
was
the
premise
on
which
the
firearms
act
and
the
narcotics
act
were
enacted--
and
if
you
are
in
possession
of
those...
that
sort
of
item
that
can
pose
such
a
threat
to
the
community,
it's
up...
congress
wanted
it
to
be
up
to
you
to
investigate
what
the
nature
of
the
item
is
that
you
had,
and
what
the
legal
requirements
that
you
had
to
comply
with
in
order
to
possess
it.
that
conclusion
is
particularly
apt
because
this
was
a
registration
and
recordkeeping
provision.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
guess
i'd
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
in
1934
when
congress...
what
congress
did
want
to
regulate
was
machineguns.
it
wanted
to
know
how
many
machineguns
there
were,
who
had
them,
who
had
control
of
them,
where
they
were
located,
in
order
to
enforce
that.
just
as
with
the
narcotics
act
where
there
were
many
other
drugs
that
were
not
regulated
aside
from
opiates
and
cocaine,
by
the
act,
in
both
cases
i
think
the
situation
was
exactly
parallel.
there
were
many
things
which
congress
didn't
want
to
directly
regulate,
but
these
are
items
that
are
dangerous,
that
pose...
can
pose
threats,
serious
threats
to
the
general
welfare,
and
they
didn't
want,
in
the
case
of
machineguns,
machineguns
to
be
kicking
around
in
somebody's
attic
where
they
can
surface
at
some
later
date
and
wreak
havoc
on
the
community.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think...
well,
i
guess
i
do
think
the
historical
point
is
important.
but
i
think,
analytically,
the
vast
majority
of
those
guns
that
are
unregulated
are
not
machineguns,
couldn't
fire
automatically,
and
wouldn't
be
supposed
to
be
machineguns
by
anybody.
it's
not
a
serious
burden
that's
put
on
people.
but
i
think
that
if
you
do...
the
court's
decisions
in
bailant,
in
dotterweich,
in
the
more
recent
freed,
and
in
international
minerals,
i
think
that
they
do
set
a
line
that
when
you're
dealing...
although...
that
when
you're
dealing
with
extraordinarily
hazardous
items
and
especially
where
there's
a
registration/recordkeeping
scheme
where
congress
wanted
to
know
the
locations
of
those
items
and
who
had
them,
that
the
people
who
have
those
extraordinarily
dangerous
items,
it's
up
to
them
to
find
out
what
it
is
precisely
that
they
own.
it's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
there
have...
as
i
said,
there
have
been
courts
that
have
taken
that
view.
and
that
view,
i
suppose,
would
be
an
intermediate
view,
where
there
had
no
external
indicia
that
could
alert
one
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
machinegun.
but
frankly
i
don't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate.
i
think
it's
appropriate
both
because
congress...
i
think,
primarily,
for
the
reasons
i've
already
said,
but
because
when
congress
enacted
the
statute,
they
didn't
include
a
mens
rea
component
here.
they
did
model
it
on
the
harrison
narcotics
act.
and
in
other
areas
where
you're
dealing
with--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
guess,
well...
i
think,
actually,
the
way
i
would
put
it
would
be
that
the
burden
is
on...
would...
the
burden
would
be
on
petitioners
to
show
that
even
though
congress
didn't
include...
it's
not
their
failure
to
act
positively.
they
did
act
positively.
they
enacted
a
criminal
statute
that
provides
that
it
is
unlawful
to
possess
a
machinegun
that's
not
registered
in
the
national
firearms
registration
records.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
well...
well,
without...
without
indicating
a
mens
rea.
and
in
doing
that...
as
i
said,
it
followed
exactly
the
harrison
narcotics
act.
and
in
the
line...
it's...
the
decisions
that
have
applied
the
principle
that
we're
talking
about
aren't
limited
to
the
bailant
case.
in
the
dotterweich
case
you
were
talking
about
misbranded
or
adulterated
drugs.
now,
there's
a
wide
variety
of
unmisbranded
or
nonadulterated
drugs
that
are
around.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
mean,
i
guess
i'd
make
two
points
in
response
to
that.
first,
congress
has,
though,
decided
it
wanted
to
regulate
machineguns.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
congress
wanted
to
regulate
other
types
of
guns.
all
it
wanted
was
to
know
that
if
you
had
a
machinegun
and
if
you
knew...
that
if
people
who
had
machineguns
had
to
have
them
registered
and
it
wanted
to
know
where
they
were,
that
doesn't
suggest
that
it's
trying
to
regulate
other
types
of
guns,
it's
just
suggesting
that
they
wanted
to
make
the
regulation
of
machineguns
an
effective
regulation
that
would
ensure
that
they
got
registered.
the
second
point
i'd
make
is
that
throughout
the
years
since
the
gun
control
act
of
1968,
when
congress
has
extensively...
in
1968
they
recodified
the
national
firearms
act.
in
1986
they
amended
it,
as
well
as
the
gun
control
act,
which
are
the
title
18
provisions.
throughout
those
years,
and
up
until
very
recently,
the
courts
were
unanimous
or
almost
unanimous
that
our
position
in
this
case
was
right,
and
that
all
you
had
to
know
was
to
know
that
it
was
a
weapon
in
the
general
sense,
in
the
general
sense.
there
was
no
need
for
congress
for
act--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
d....
as
we
read
the
cases,
the
only...
the
d.c.
circuit
is
the
only...
is
the
one
that
created
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
the
issue
in
this
case.
there
are
three
circuits,
the
ninth
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
fifth...
i
think
the
fifth
circuit,
that
have
held...
have
appeared
to
us,
at
least,
to
distinguish
between
guns
that...
where
the
modification
is
entirely
internal
and
entire...
and
guns
where
there's
some
external
modification,
as
there
was
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
suppose...
one
could
accept
that.
i
think
the
jury
squarely
rejected
petitioner's
evidence
that
the
gun
was
defective.
there
was
nothing
defective
about
the
gun.
perhaps
if
it
had
an
additional
part,
it
could
have
operated
more
reliably.
but
there
was
extensive
evidence
that
the
gun
had
been
taken
out...
evidence...
ammunition
of
various...
several
different
types
had
been
put
in
the
gun,
and
it
had
fired
automatically
with
a
single
pull
of
the
trigger.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't...
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
if
the
gun,
in
fact...
if
the
gun
was...
i
suppose
it
might...
might
matter
what
you
mean
by
defective.
if
the
gun
occasion...
once
or
twice
fired
multiple
rounds
and...
but
was...
i
think
a
jury
reasonably
could
find
and
a
defendant
reasonably
could
argue
to
a
jury
that
this
just
wasn't
a
machinegun,
it
was
an
occasional
defect.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
and
it's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if
it...
if
it
fire...
if
it
fires
multiple
rounds.
i
mean,
i...
let
me
refer
to
the
language
of
the
definition.
a
machinegun
is
defined
as
any
weapon--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--actually,
it's
excerpted
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
any
weapon
which
shoots,
is
designed
to
shoot,
or
can
be
readily
restored
to
shoot
automatically
more
than
one
shot
without
manual
reloading.
i
think
when
it
says
would
shoot...
which
shoots,
or
is
designed
to
shoot,
or
can
be
readily
restored
to
shoot,
i
think
you
could
take
the
term
"shoot"
there
not
to
mean
that
it
did
it
once
by
virtue
of
some
defect--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
type
of...
this
is
a
capability
that
this
weapon
has.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
hesitate
to
depart
too
far,
because
i
think
it
has
to
have
the
general
capability
of
shooting
more
than
once
with
a
single
pull
of
the
trigger.
i
suppose
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't...
in
the...
in
the...
i
guess
i
don't
see
the
ambiguity.
i
mean,
i
think
there
are
going
to
be...
there
are
going
to
be
close
cases--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't...
actually,
i
don't
think
it's
an
ambiguity.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
the
application
of
a
lot
of
fact.
the
question
is
does
this
gun
have
the
capability
of
shooting
automatically.
that
question
could
arise
even
if
you
took
petitioner's
view
of
the
case.
under
any
view
of
the
case,
you
could
have
a
question
of
whether
the
gun
itself
was
or
was
not
an
automatic
weapon.
the
question
is
whether
it
has
the
general
capability
of
shooting
automatically.
that's
a
question
that
can
be
argued
to
the
jury,
but
that's
a
question--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
and
that's
a
question
on
which
there
was
conflicting
evidence
in
this
case,
but
there
was
extensive
evidence
that
this
gun
would
fire,
as
a
matter
of
course,
if
you
put
in...
if
you
held
the
trigger
down
and
put
in
ordinarily
commercially
available
ammunition,
it
would
fire
automatically.
and
the
jury
credited
that
evidence
and
it
didn't
credit
the
defendant's
evidence.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
recall...
i
actually
don't
recall
the
specific--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
jury
was
instructed
that...
was
instructed,
i
think,
in
terms
of
the
definition
of
machinegun
that
i
read
to
you,
as
i
recall.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
so
it
was
instructed
on
what
a
machinegun
is.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--again,
i
don't
recall.
i
don't...
it
wasn't...
the
latter
instruction
i
don't
think
was
given.
i
don't
recall
specifically.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
what
you
can
say
is
that
the
jury
concluded
that
the
gun
was
an
automatic
gun,
as
defined
by...
an
automatic
gun
as
defined
by
the
statute.
and
also
i
really
have
to
say--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
have
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rule,
as
i
recall,
on
any
theory...
on
the
theory
of
defective
weapon.
and
the
petition
for
cert
doesn't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
let
me
go...
as
far
as
the
theory
of
defect
goes,
i
don't
understand
exactly
what
the
theory
of
defect
is.
if
the
theory
of
defect
is
that
it
was
able...
it
shot
once,
because
something
was
wrong
with
it,
multiple
times
with
a
pull
of
the
trigger,
but
couldn't...
that
couldn't
be
repeated.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
that...
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
guess...
i
don't
mean
to
fight
the
premises
here,
but
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--perhaps.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
had
to
find
that
this
was
a
machinegun.
the
jury
in...
if
petitioner's
defense
was,
well,
this
only
fired
automatically
because
it
was
a
defect,
and
i
didn't
mean
it
to
fire
automatically,
no
the
jury
wasn't
asked
to
rule
on
any
question
like
that.
the
fact
was
that
this
gun
was
fitted
with
automatic
parts.
it
had
a
piece...
a
pin
which
ordinarily
sits
on
the
receiver
and
would
keep...
even
if
all
the
automatic
parts,
all
the
semiautomatic
parts
had
been
replaced
by
automatic
parts,
that
pin
would
keep
the
lever
from
shifting
over
to
the
automatic
position.
that
pin
had
been
visibly
ground
down.
now,
if...
petitioner's
view
of
defect,
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
was
simply
that
the
gun
could
have
had
another
part
which
would
have
made
it
fire...
which
would
have
made
it
fire
automatically
more
reliably,
and
that
since
it
didn't
have
that
part,
it
only
fired
automatically
as
a
result
of
a
defect.
in
our
view,
i
don't
think
that
was
any
real
distinction,
and
there
was
no
reason
to
instruct
the
jury.
but
in
any
sense
in
which
it's
relevant,
i
think
the
jury
did
reject
the
theory
of
defect.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
would
say
there's
about
three
factors.
there's...
one
is
the
correlation
between...
the
congress'
attempt
to
model
this
act
on
the
harrison
narcotics
act.
there's
two,
that
this
involves
highly
dangerous
items
that
are
a
serious
threat
to
the
community.
and
three,
that
it's
a
registration
and
recordkeeping
requirement.
it's
a...
it's
in...
the
criminal
prohibition
here
is
in
aid
of
seeing
to
it
that
these
weapons
get
registered
and
that
the
government
know
where
they
are
and
who
has
them.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
where
congress...
we
would
be
comfortable
with
the
rule
that
where
congress
doesn't
specify
otherwise,
and
where
it's
dealing
with
highly
hazardous
threats
to
the
community
and
imposes
a
registration
and
recordkeeping
requirement,
that
in
those
circumstances
a
very
weak
scienter
requirement
of
the
sort
that
was
given
to
the
jury
here
is
appropriate.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
i
didn't
mean
to
concede
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
sorry.
what
i
was
really...
what
i
mean
to
say
was
where
there's
no
specific...
there's
no
specification
of
a
knowledge
requirement,
i
think
it
ordinarily
is
appropriate
to
require
that
the
defendant
at
least
know
the
facts,
or
the
primary
facts,
or
the
crucial
facts
that
make
his
conduct
illegal.
i
do
think
it's
a
question
of
reading
each
particular--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
i
don't
think
that
there
is...
there's
all...
there's
virtually
never
a
requirement,
unless
it's
otherwise
specified,
of
knowledge
of
the
law.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
and
if...
if
we
were--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--because--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
mean
i
guess...
i
guess
what
i
would
add
to
that
is
that
the
primary
determinant
should
be
what
congress'
intent
was.
and
the
point
about
this
looking
like
another
act
is...
i
think
that's
a
very
strong
index
of
what
congress'
intent
was--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
is
a
stiff
sentence,
i'll
agree.
but
this
act,
when
it
was
enacted,
for
instance...
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
intent
requirement
would
be
any
different
today...
had
a
prison
requirement
of
5
years
and
$2,000,
which,
word
for
word,
was
the
same
as
the
penalty
provision
in
the
harrison
narcotics
act
that
the
court...
that
the
court
interpreted--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
true
that
it
is
a
severe
penalty.
but
as
i
said,
that...
that
penalty
was
not...
it's
not
that
different
from
the
penalty
that
was
in
effect
when
the
act
was
first
passed.
and
there's
certainly
no
reason
to
think
that
over
the
years...
i
think
congress
upped
the
penalty
from
5
years
to
10
years
in
1968,
but
that
either
then
or
in
1986
when
additional
amendments,
some
amendments
were
made
here
and
some
to
the
gun
control
act...
that
at
any
of
those
times
congress
wanted
to
change
the
act.
in
fact,
to
the
contrary,
at
all
relevant
times
both
the
line
of
decisions
that
i've
cited,
dotterweich
and
bailant,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it's
recognized
in
morissette
as
well
and
international
minerals...
at
all
relevant
times
those
decisions
uniformly
supported
our
position,
as
did
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
there's...
there's
really
distinctions
on
both
sides
of
that.
first,
when
in
19...
when
congress
enacted
the
harrison
narcotics
act...
and
generally
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
drugs
were
much
less
regulated
than
they
are
today.
and
the
harrison
narcotics
act
only
purported
to
regulate
cocaine
and
opiates,
not
any
other
drugs.
but
secondly,
from
the
other
point
of
view,
i
think
guns
are
extensively
regulated
in
our
society.
they
are
items
that
are
very
dangerous
and
are
known
to
be
dangerous
by
people,
and
congress
legislated
under
that
background
assumption.
and
guns
are
sufficiently
highly...
are
sufficiently
regulated
and
sufficiently
dangerous
that
if
you
have
one,
it's
up
to
you
to
determine
whether...
whether
it
fires
automatically.
another
example,
for
instance,
would
be
a
short-barreled
rifle.
the
short-barreled
rifles
or
short...
or
sawed-off
shotguns
are
also
firearms
under
the
national
firearms
act.
it's...
i
don't
think
someone
could
reasonably...
could
reasonably...
under
petitioner's
view,
the
government
has
to
prove,
i
suppose,
that
somebody
took
out
a
ruler
and
measured
the
length
of
a
barrel
on
one
of
those
weapons
and
saw
that
it
was
less
than
the
specified
16
or
18
inches
in
the
statute.
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
congress
intended.
congress
intended
that
if
you
own
a
shotgun
or
a
rifle,
it's
up
to
you
to
determine
how
long
the
barrel
is.
and
so
long
as
you
know
you
own
the
rifle
or
the
shotgun,
if
the
barrel
is
shorter
than
the
16
or
18
inches,
it's
a
firearm
under
the
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
that's
not
our
position.
our
position
is
you
have
to
know--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--is
you
do
have
to
know
it's
a
gun.
the
possession...
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
position
we
have--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--because
i
think
in
draws
the
line
that
the
court
has
drawn
between
items
xx
apparent
xx
re
entirely
innocent,
such
as...
such
as
food
stamps
xx
type
of
conduct
at
issue
in
united
states
gypsum--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--in
bailant,
that's
not
what
they
said.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
bailant
they
didn't
address
what
you...
what
the...
what
the
court
held
in
bailant
was
that
you...
it
rejected
petitioner's
position
in
this
case,
which
is
you
don't
have
to
know
that
what
you
possessed
was
opiates
or
cocaine.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
they...
the
court
didn't
go
into
what
you
do
have
to
know.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
to
some
extent--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
it's
reasonable
that...
i
think
the
question
of
what
you
do
have
to
know
is...
well,
it's
one
that
they
didn't
address
in
bailant.
and
generally...
i
mean,
generally,
you
could
interpret
this
to
be
a
strict
liability
offense.
however,
in
light
of
the
court's
distinctions
in...
between,
for
instance,
cases
such
as
liparota
and
united
states
gypsum,
and
cases
like
bailant
or
dotterweich
or
freed,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
draw
the
line
and
infer
a
very
mild
scienter
requirement.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
as
far
as
i'm
aware.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
it
was--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there
was
testimony
about
dillinger
i
believe.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would
be
one
formulation,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i've
completed.
