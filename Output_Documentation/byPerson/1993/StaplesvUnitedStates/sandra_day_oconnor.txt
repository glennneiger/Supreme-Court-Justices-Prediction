well,
now,
counsel,
i
am
somewhat
concerned
about--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
argument
in
your
brief,
and
apparently
one
you're
going
to
make
here,
that
we
have
before
us
this
issue
of
whether
the
defendant
actually
knew
it
was
automatic.
i
thought
the
jury
found
that
it
was
a
machinegun,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overturn
that
finding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
jury
had
to
find

it

a

they
didn't
have
to
find
that
your
client
knew
of
its
capability.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
firearm
was
defined
in
this
instance,
under
this
statute,
as
something
that
fires
automatically
with
a
single
pull
of
the
trigger.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
was
the
finding
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
upset
that.
so
we...
we
take
that
as
a
given,
don't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
feldman,
now,
just
to
clarify
for
us,
you
agree
that
this
weapon
was
manufactured
as
a
semiautomatic?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
manufactured,
it
would
not
fall
within
the
definition
of
a
machinegun?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if...
if
the
modifications
of
a
weapon
were...
were
strictly
internal
so
there
was
nothing
on
the
exterior
that
would
alert
a
possessor
about
the
change,
and
if
you
had
a
defendant
who
simply
didn't
know
that
the
weapon
had
been
modified
internally
when
it
was
purchased,
that
person
would
be
liable
under
your
theory,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
just
want
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
want
to
understand
how
far
your
theory
goes,
and
it
would
go
so
far
as
to
hold
someone
who
was
absolutely
unaware
of
the
modification
liable.
