justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
have
an
opinion
to
announce
on
behalf
of
justice
o'connor
who
is
also
absent
today.
this
is
no.93-445,
beecham
and
jones
against
the
united
states.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
petitioners,
beecham
and
jones,
were
convicted
of
being
felons
in
possession
of
firearms.
under
the
felon
in
possession
law,
a
person
may
regain
the
right
to
possess
firearms
if
he
has
had
civil
rights
restored
for
his
conviction,
and
beecham
and
jones
claimed
this
exemption
applied
to
them.
but
both
petitioners
had
prior
federal
convictions
as
well
as
prior
state
convictions
and
their
civil
rights
had
been
restored
only
under
state
law,
and
for
this
reason,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
the
petitioners.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
a
civil
rights
restoration
can
nullify
the
affect
of
a
conviction
only
if
it
was
performed
by
the
convicting
jurisdiction.
petitioner's
state
civil
rights
restorations,
therefore,
cannot
undo
the
disability
flowing
from
their
federal
court
convictions.
and
this
opinion
also
is
unanimous.
