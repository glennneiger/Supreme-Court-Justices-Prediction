do
you
have
any
idea,
general
burson,
of
the
percentage
of
first
degree
murders
that
are
not
subject
to
the
capital
sentencing
procedure?
do
you
have
those
statistics--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
can
you
get
them
to
me?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
can't
give
us
any
idea
of
the
percentage
of
the
total
universe
of
first
degree
murders
that
the
excluded
portion
consists
of?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
your
whole
position
here
was
that
felony
is
itself
a
discrete
category
which
is
a
sufficient
aggravator.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
why
you're
running
away
from
that
just
a
little
bit
in
response
to
justice
souter
and
justice
ginsburg's
question.
a
felony
murder
is
itself
a
separate
evil
that
the
state
can
punish
in
an
aggravating
way,
because
a
felony
is
involved.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that's
what
your
position--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
notice
that
tennessee
has
as
one
of
its
aggravating
factors
the
killing
of
a
child
under
12
years
of
age.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
someone
kills
an
11-year-old,
can
they
argue
under
your
theory
that
really
it's
irrational
to
distinguish
between
someone
who
kills
an
11-year-old
and
a
12-year-old?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
rationality
there
that's
not
present
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
should
think
it's
eminently
more
rational
than
the
11-year-old,
12-year-old
dichotomy,
because
the
state
is
interested
in
deterring
felonies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
just
before
you
subside,
justice
ginsburg
asked
you
a
question
about
a
robbery
with
an
intentional
murder
and
a
robbery
with
a
reckless
murder.
i
take
it...
let's
have
a
third
hypothetical.
let's
say
there's
just
a
sniper
who
does
not
enter
the
house.
he
kills
the
homeowner
intentionally.
that
person
must
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty
only
if
there
is
an
aggravating
circumstance,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
you're
saying
is
they're
equally
culpable,
and
that
this
is
the
differential
that's
unconstitutional.
so
you
have
to
say,
basically,
that
a
felony
is
not
a
sufficient
aggravator.
