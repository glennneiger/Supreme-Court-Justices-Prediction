--but--
--but
all
first
degree
murders
are
potentially
eligible.
everything
that
tends--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
be
defined
as
a
first
degree
murder
is
potentially
eligible--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
the
death
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there's
no
narrowing
at
that
stage.
all
first
degree...
everyone
that's
eligible
for
first
degree
murder...
everyone
convicted
of
a
first
degree
murder,
whether
felony
murder
or
premeditated
murder,
is
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
and
all
of
the
narrowing
goes
on
at
the
sentencing
stage,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
burson,
maybe--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
can
ask
the
same
question
this
way.
you
don't
need
any
aggravator
other
than
the
crime
that
fits
within
the
tennessee
statute
plus
tison
for
felony
murder,
that's
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
premeditated
is
a
higher...
kind
of
a
higher
category,
and
yet
you
do
need
an
aggravator
under
the
tennessee
law
for
premeditated
murder.
that's
the
strange...
you
say,
number
1
is
premeditated
murder,
number
2
is
felony
murder,
but
felony
murder
you
don't
have
to
prove
anything
other
than
the
felony
murder
itself
with
the
tison
qualifications.
for
premeditated
murder,
you
do.
what
is
the
rationale
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
at
the
sentencing
stage,
felony
murder
is
considered
the
graver
offense
than
premeditated,
because
it
doesn't
need
any
additional
aggravator,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
once
you
have
an
aggravator,
don't
you
have
to
have
some
rationale
for
having
it
in
the
one
case
and
not
in
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
two
of
the
three
in
the
majority
said
this
holding,
based
on
article
i,
section
16
of
the
tennessee
constitution,
so
two
of
them
put
it
squarely
and
apparently
solely
on
the
tennessee
constitution,
but
they
concurred
in
the
principal
opinion,
which
puts
it
on
both
grounds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
page
you're
referring
to
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stebbins,
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
we
were
to
deal
with
a
concrete
case
than
to
talk
in
these
abstract
categories,
and
let
me
tell
you
one
that
has
been
on
my
mind.
let's
take
a
robbery
of
a
home,
and
the
robber
in
case
number
1
intentionally
kills
the
homeowner
in
that
process,
and
then
case
number
2
is
a
robbery,
and
the
robber
recklessly
kills
the
homeowner
in
that
process.
the
second
case,
on
your
rationale,
could
not
attract
the
death
penalty...
let's
assume
there's
no
other
aggravator,
just
the
felony...
but
the
first
one
could.
why
does
it
make...
why
do
you
come...
say
that
that's
rational?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no,
no,
in
the
felony
murder
case
you
don't
have
any
premeditated.
you
have
a
reckless
murder
in
conjunction
with
a
felony.
your
argument
is
that
that
person
cannot
be
subjected
to
the
death
penalty,
but
the
premeditated
murder
with
a
felony
could
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
why
in
those
two
concrete
situations
it
isn't
perfectly
logical,
rational,
to
treat
them
the
same,
to
say
that
both
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
can't
the
state
think
in
terms
of
dangerousness,
in
terms
of
deterrent,
it
wants
to
deter
that
reckless
action
as
much
as
the
premeditated
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
my
hypothetical
you
are
not
treating
them
equally,
and
you
say
that's
okay,
and
that
i
don't
understand.
reckless
plus
robbery,
no
death
penalty.
premeditated
plus
robbery,
death
penalty.
that's
what
you
say
is
fair
and
rational.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
point
is
that
it's
irrational,
constitutionally
impermissible,
for
the
state
to
say
premeditated
and
reckless
are
on
the
same
line.
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
my
hypothetical,
you're
saying
it's
necessary
to
comport
with
the
constitution
to
treat
the
felony
murder
better.
not
equally,
but
better--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
in
my
hypothetical
the
premeditated
robber
is
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
the
reckless
robber
is
not,
so
the
reckless
robber
is
being
treated
better,
not
the
same.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
in
my
two
hypothetical
cases,
that
your
answer
is
yes,
in
that
situation
you
must
favor
the
felony
murderer
by
making
that
reckless
robber
not
subject
to
the
death
penalty
where
the
premeditated
robber
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
don't
you
just
stick
with
my
hypothetical,
and
tell
me...
we
have
a
robbery
of
a
home.
the
homeowner
is
killed.
in
one
case
the
killing
was
premeditated,
in
the
other
one
it's
reckless.
i
take
it
on
your
argument
that
the
state
could
not
constitutionally
subject
the
reckless
robber
to
the
death
penalty,
or
am
i
misunderstanding
your
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
state
could
subject
the
premeditated
robber
to
the
death
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
yes
to
those
questions,
to
both,
then
you're
saying
it's
constitutionally
required
to
favor
the
felony
murderer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
not
challenging
it
as
an
aggravator
for
the
premeditated--
