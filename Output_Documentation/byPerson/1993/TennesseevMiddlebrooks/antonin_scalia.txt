justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
intent
murders
would...
what
you
have
called
simple
intent
murders
would
satisfy
tison.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
we
don't
know
whether
your
supreme
court
might
not
have
read
in
the
tison
requirement
on
its
own,
do
we?
do
we
have
any
cases
in
which
your
supreme
court
declined
to
read
in
tison
before
we
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
claim
they've
gone
further
than
we
have
in
the
present
case.
surely
they
might
on
their
own
have
gone
as
far
as
tison
before
we
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
that
that
aggravating
circumstance
is
not
constitutionally
required
anyway.
if
they
do
it
for
the
one
but
not
for
the
other,
they
do
it
voluntarily
and
without
federal
constitutional
compulsion
for
the
one.
you
said
that
they
don't
need
that
further
aggravator,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
it
was
enough
simply
to
have
first
degree
murder
defined
the
way
your
state
defines
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
would
not
have
any
further--
justice
antonin
scalia
--aggravating
circumstance
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
whatever...
even
if
justice
souter's...
is
correct
that
you
have
an
aggravating
circumstance
for
the
one
type
of
first
degree
murder
but
not
for
the
other,
it
is
not
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
your
view
that
is
required
by
the
federal
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
one
that
tennessee
chose
to
create
on
its
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
your
point
that
that's
irrational,
and
therefore
doesn't
meet
rational
basis
review?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
does
it
violate
the
federal
constitution
so
long
as
the
narrowing
within
the
definition
of
first
degree
murder
is
alone
enough
to
comply
with
our
narrowing
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
point,
that
it's
unprincipled
and
fails
rational
basis
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
last
case
of
ours
that
held
a
state
statute
failed
rational
basis
review?
justice
antonin
scalia
many
moons.
it's
been
a
long
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're
free
to
find
it
violates
the
tennessee
constitution.
that's
not
what
we're
discussing
here.
we're
discussing
whether
it
violates
the
federal
constitution.
if
we
find
that
it
doesn't,
tennessee
can
find
it
to
violate
its
constitution
whatever
way
it
wants.
i
think
we're
just
discussing
the
federal
issues
here,
aren't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
only
one
type
of
first
degree
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
an
aggravator
which
in
effect
says
this
one
type
of
first
degree
murder
is
worse
than
the
other
type
of
first
degree
murder.
it's
still
an
aggravator,
however.
now,
you
may
argue
that
that
is
a
rather
sloppy
way
of
achieving
that
result,
but
can
you
say
that
the
result
is
irrational?
the
state
has
decided
that
of
the
two
types
of
murder
that
fall
within
first
degree,
one
is
worse
than
the
other,
and
they
choose
to
make
that
determination
by
declaring
that
whole
class
to
be
an
aggravator.
i
agree
it's
logically
pretty
sloppy,
but
i
don't
know
that
it's
irrational.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stebbins--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
need
aggravating
circumstances
at
all.
i
mean,
we've
said
you
can
narrow...
you
don't
have
to
narrow
at
the
jury
stage,
you
can
narrow
at
the
definition
stage,
so
we
don't
really
need
aggravating
circumstance,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
assume
that
what
tennessee
has
is
this
situation.
it
defines
first
degree
murder
as
all
murder
that
is
committed
with
intent
or
reckless
disregard.
all
killing
with
intent
or
reckless
disregard.
then
it
defines
as
aggravating
circumstances
premeditation
or
felony
murder,
murder
in
the
course
of
a
felony.
would
that
be
constitutional,
in
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
would
not.
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what...
what?
every
killing
that
is
done
with
intent
or
reckless
disregard
is
done
with
either
meditation
or
in
the
course
of
another
felony?
that
narrows
it
a
lot,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
very
broad
definition
of
first
degree
murder.
it
includes
all
murder
with
intent
or
with
reckless
disregard.
the
case
goes
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
is
told,
you
may
impose
death
if
you
find
an
aggravating
circumstance
of
premeditation
or
of
killing
in
the
course
of
a
felony.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
the
right
answer
for
your
case.
i
mean,
you
would
have
to
say
that
that's
bad
in
order
to
say
that
this
is
bad,
because
what
this
boils
down
to
is
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--surely
you're
not
suggesting
that
every
time
a
state
creates
an
aggravator
it
is
acting
unconstitutionally
if
it
has
not
included
as
an
aggravator
something
that
is
even
worse
than
the
aggravators
it
has
included.
is
that
what
you're
arguing,
that
unless
the
state
comes
forth
with
a
full-blown
system
of
all
aggravators
in
their
proper--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
they
put
one
aggravator
here.
there
may
be
things
that
are
even
worse.
