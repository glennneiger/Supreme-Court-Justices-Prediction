mr.
david
c.
stebbins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
by
clarifying
a
few
points
of
tennessee
law,
if
i
might.
first
degree
murder
in
tennessee
is
defined
as
felony
murder
or
premeditated
murder.
all
first
degree
murderers
are
death-eligible,
but
no
first
degree
murderer
can
be
sentenced
to
death
absent
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
all
twelve
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
require
proof
of
additional
elements
for
persons
convicted
of
premeditated
murder.
eleven
of
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
require
proof
of
additional
elements
for
persons
convicted
of
felony
murder.
only
with
the
felony
murder
aggravating
circumstance
is
there
automatic
elevation
of
one
class
of
murderers
into
being
subject
to
the
death
penalty
above
the
other
class
without
proof
of
anything
further.
two
other
points
is--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--well,
i
think
my
point
is
that
the
tennessee...
this
is
what
the
tennessee
supreme
court
found
to
violate
the
tennessee
constitution.
the
fact
that
this
one
class
is
automatically
elevated...
this
one
class
is
defined,
excuse
me,
to
be
the
morally
culpably
equivalent
class...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
no,
i
believe
it
does,
because
the
problem
is
we're
not
just
talking
about
narrowing
here,
but
some
principled
narrowing,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--yes,
it
fails--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--i
can't
point
you
to
a
case,
your
honor,
but
looking
at
what
the
tennessee--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--that
may
be,
but
the
tennessee
supreme
court
here
has
found
that
it
violates
article
i,
section
16
of
the
tennessee
constitution.
they've
also
made
that
finding
as
an
independent
finding,
independent
of
any
eighth
amendment
analysis.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
i
understand
that,
but
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
first,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
is
that
this
is
an
independent
state
ground
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
relied
on.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
but
i
think,
your
honor,
under
the
majority
opinion
that
there
are
alternative,
independent,
adequate
state
grounds.
in...
at
page
4950
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert,
the
court
makes
a
very
clear
state
law
finding.
it
says,
and
i
quote,
"our
legislature,
however,
has
seen
fit
to
prohibit
such
duplication
by
statute
in
noncapital
sentencing,
and
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
article
i,
section
16
of
the
tennessee
constitution
prohibits
such
duplication
in
capital
sentencing
as
well.
"
this
conclusion
they
reach
by
looking
only
at
the
tennessee
sentencing
statutes
for
noncapital
cases,
looking
at
the
capital
sentencing
procedures
in
tennessee,
and
looking
at
the
tennessee
constitution.
there
is
no
mention
at
this
point
of
the
federal
constitution
or
any
federal
case
law.
because
of
that,
this
is
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground,
and
this
which
allows...
excuse
me...
which
prevents
this
court
from
hearing
the
case,
because
of
the
independence
and
adequacy
of
the
state
ground,
and
as
you
look
also
at
the
second
portion
of
the
court's
opinion
concerning
the
narrowing,
the
court
specifically
rejects
federal
case
law,
the
rationale
of
federal
case
law
in
lowenfield--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--certainly.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
i
just
wanted
to
make
a
couple
of
quick
points
on
it,
your
honor,
because
at
least
in
one
other
case...
i'm
familiar
with
this
case
in
a
similar
situation,
ohio
v.
huertas
just
a
couple
of
terms
ago,
did
dismiss
the
writ
after
argument,
and
most
of
the
argument
was
based
on
a
state
law
analysis,
but
i
will
be
very
brief,
your
honor.
but
i
would
just
like
to
make
the
point
that
in
the
second
part
of
the
opinion
that
they
reject
the
rationale
of
lowenfield
as
finding
it
inapposite
under
the
tennessee
constitution,
and
under
the
tennessee
constitution
adopt
the
rationale
of...
the
non-federal
rationale
announced
in
cherry,
in
engberg,
and
in
collins.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i'll...
the...
page
61
and
62,
a-61
and
62
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert.--
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
found
that
the
treatment
of
the
felony
murderer
separately
and
differently
than
the
equivalently
defined
premeditated
murderers
is
irrational
under
the
tennessee
constitution,
and
i
would
submit
that
it's
equally
irrational
under
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
under
my
theory,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
my
theory
is--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--well,
there
you've
got
something
that
is
different
from
the
crime
itself.
the
problem
with
the
felony
murder
aggravator
in
tennessee
is
it
defines
the
crime
of
first
degree
murder.
first
degree
murder
in
tennessee
is
a
murder
committed
during
the
course
of
a
felony.
you
find
that,
the
jury
finds
that,
and
they
find
the
person
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
the
jury
is
then
told--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
well--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--but
as
the
tennessee
supreme
court
found,
though,
that
the
tennessee
legislature
has
defined
felony
murderers
and
premeditated
murderers
to
be
equally
culpable.
they
are
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
then
automatically,
not
by
any
operation...
just
by
the
operation
of
the
statute,
the
felony
murderers
are
elevated
up
to
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
when
premeditated
murderers
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
views
as
equally
culpable
or
perhaps
even
more
culpable
are
not
treated
worse,
and
the--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--well,
just
last
term
in
arave
v.
creech,
this
court
held
that
there
was...
where
an
aggravating
circumstance
serves
to
distinguish
those
who
are
sentenced
to
death
from
those
who
are
not,
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
must
genuinely
narrow
on
a
principle
basis,
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court
essentially
here
has
said
this
is
not
principled.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
for
one,
your
honor,
yes,
and
i
think
also
in
zant
v.
stevens
this
court
addressed
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
where
they
are
used
to
narrow
the
class
of
persons
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
must
have
some
rational
penalogical
basis.
they
must
satisfy
one
of
the
concerns
of
this
court
expressed
in
furman,
that
the
death
penalty
not
be
imposed
in
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
manner.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
well,
first
of
all
i
think
that's
incorrect
under
what
i'm
saying.
i
think
in
both
of
those
situations
a
person
could
be
sentenced
to
death,
because
you
have
a
felony
plus
an
intentional
or
premeditated
murder.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
yes,
but
the
premeditated
murderer
with
nothing
else,
without
the
additional
felony,
could
not
be
sentenced
to
death.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
well,
very
simply,
in
the
one
hypothetical,
your
honor,
you've
got...
as
i
understand
it,
and
perhaps
i
misunderstand
your
hypothetical,
but
you've
got
premeditation
and
something
else.
you
have
a
felony.
in
the
second
hypothetical,
you
have
no
premeditation,
no
intent,
or
perhaps
reckless
intent,
and
you
have
the
commission
of
a
felony
which
raises
it
up
to
be
the
equivalent
of
premeditated
murder
in
the
first
place,
and
you
have
nothing
in
addition
to
distinguish
that
murderer
from
the
first
murderer,
or
to
make
him
worse.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
that's
my
point
exactly,
your
honor.
if
they
are
treated
equally,
then
i
would
have
no
complaint
here,
but
they're
not.
they're
treating
the
reckless
and...
first
of
all,
if
i
may
make
a
point,
is
that
in
this
case
and
prior
to
1989
in
tennessee
there
was
no
reckless
requirement,
and
no
recklessness
has
been
made.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
yes.
i
mean,
the
problem
i'm
making,
though,
is
that,
not
the
premeditation
plus
robbery,
a
premeditated
murder
with
nothing
else
would
satisfy
the
death
penalty,
would
get
a
death
penalty
here.
reckless,
which
only
becomes
the
equivalent
of
a
premeditated
murder
because
it
was
committed
during
the
course
of
a
robbery,
is
then
automatically
subjected
to
the
death
penalty,
whereas
with
the
premeditated
murder,
who
is
already
all
by
itself
a
highly
culpable
crime
because
of
the
definition
of
premeditation--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--no.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
that's
not
my
point.
my
point
is
it's
constitutionally
impermissible
to
treat
the
reckless
murderer
worse
than
the
premeditated
murderer,
because
the
reckless--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--i--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--but
the
premeditated
robber
is
being
treated
worse
because
of
there
is
an
additional
element
proven
in
the
crime...
the
robbery.
with
the
reckless
robber,
he
is
being
elevated
already
to
being
the
equivalent
of
the
premeditated
murderer
merely
by
the
use
of
the
robbery,
and
then
he's
elevated
up
above
that
by
the
use
of
the
robbery
also.
a
reckless
murder
by
itself,
without
the
robbery,
would
not
be
death-eligible
in
tennessee.
only
because
it's
committed
during
the
course
of
a
felony
does
a
reckless
or
unintentional
murder
become
the
equivalent
of
premeditated
murder
in
the
first
place.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
again,
your
honor,
i
appear
to
be
missing
your
point
on
this,
or
i'm
not
explaining
myself
well.
if
you
have
a
premeditated
murder...
if
i
may
make
a
hypothetical
all
by
itself--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--no,
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
again,
it's
not
favoring
the
felony...
reckless
felony
murderer,
your
honor.
the
reckless
felony
murderer
goes
in
to
rob
the
home
with
no
intent.
he
is
raised
up
to
be
the
equivalent
of
the
premeditated
murderer
merely
by
the
proof
of
the
robbery.
the
premeditated
murder
all
by
itself
is
death-eligible.
the
reckless
killer
is
not
death-eligible
absent
adding
the
robbery
on
top
of
that.
that
raises
it
up
to
be
first
degree
murder.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
i
believe
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i
also
believe--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--your
honor,
i
would
say
that
if
you
look
at
this
court's
holding
in
all
of
its
holdings
from
like,
gregg,
and
zant,
and
creech
last
year,
whenever
there
has
been
a
definition
by
a
state
that
is
as
broad
as
this,
that
includes
felony
murder
with
no
intent,
it
includes
plain,
premeditated
murder
as
the
basis
for
death
eligibility,
that
every
state
where
this
court
has
looked,
it
has
required
proof
of
some
additional--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--i
believe,
though,
if
you
look
at
this
court's
opinion
in
lowenfield,
for
example,
lowenfield
says
the
states
may
do
two
things,
they
may
broadly
define
death-eligible
crimes,
and
if
they
broadly
define
them,
i.e.
saying
felony
murder
or
premeditation,
then
they
must
have
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
narrows
the
class,
or
they
may
very
narrowly
define
the
class
of
death-eligible
murderers
as
texas
and
louisiana
have
done.
if
they
do
that,
then
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
for
further
narrowing.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
this
court
simply
has
never
approved
such
a
scheme.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
no,
the
state
has
never
disapproved
it,
either,
but
again,
if
you
look
at
this
last
term
in
creech,
this
court
analyzed
the
idaho
statute
and
looked
at
it
and
declared
it
very
broad,
and
the
court
went
on
to
look
at
the
aggravating
circumstance
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case
and
found
that
under
the
idaho
scheme
and
under
the
eighth
amendment,
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
aggravating
circumstance
to
narrow
that
class
of
death-eligible
people.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
the...
yes.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
if
the
definition
is
sufficiently
narrow--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--i...
i...
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
it
would
not--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--it
would
not...
two
reasons.
one,
it
would
not
narrow
the
class
at
all.
it
would
include
every
one
of
those
persons,
basically.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
hypothetical.
i
thought
you
defined
it
so
that
that
would
basically--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--i
don't
believe
that
this
court
would
find
that
that
provides
adequate
guidance
for
the
jury
or
have
sufficiently
narrowed
the
class.
i...
no
case
this
court
has
held
since
1972
has
found--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--yes.
the
question
is,
how
broadly--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
there's
eight--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--there
has
been...
yes,
not
every
felony
is
included
in
that,
but
every
felony
that
is
included
in
the
definition
of
first
degree
murder
is
also
included
in
the
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
no.
no,
there
isn't,
your
honor,
and
the
court
has
not
required
that
where
there
has
been
a
sufficiently
narrow
definition
of
first
degree
murder
or
death
eligibility,
and
i
would
submit
that
in...
last
term,
the
case
that
this
court
reviewed
from
idaho,
that
the
definition
of
death
eligibility
there
was
considerably
narrower
than
what
tennessee
has,
and
yet
this
court
still
required
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
that
situation
to
genuinely
narrow
the
class
and
provide
some
guidance.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
well,
the
court
went
on,
and
after
determining
vagueness
to
discuss
and
state
very
plainly
that
not
only
must
the
aggravating
circumstance
be
definite,
but
it
must
genuinely
narrow,
and
do
so
on
a
principled
basis,
citing
zant
v.
stevens
primarily
for
that
proposition,
and
this
court
has
held
where
a
state
uses
aggravating
circumstance
to
genuinely
narrow...
whether
they
have
to
or
not,
but
where
they
do,
they
have
to
narrow
in
a
principled
manner
and
they
have
to
define
a
class
of
persons
that's
more
culpable
than
another
class.
here,
you
have
one
class
of
equally
culpable,
as
defined
by
the
tennessee
legislature,
first
degree
murderers
automatically
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
and
the
other
class
is
not
so
automatically
subjected
to
the
death
penalty.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
yes.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
a
nonpremeditated
killing
during
the
course
of
an
unlisted--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--the
fact
that
it
was
committed
during
another
felony
that's
not
listed
in
the
first
degree
murder
statute
would
have
no
effect
on
it.
there
is
no
second
degree
felony
murder
in
tennessee.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
correct.
it
might
be
involuntary
manslaughter,
but
it
could
not
be
murder.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
perhaps
i
got
the
hypothetical
wrong.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
if
it
was
an
intentional
murder,
it
would
be
murder.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
yes,
but
the
fact
it
would
require
intent,
and
the
fact
that
a
nonlisted
felony
was
also
committed
would
have
no
effect
at
all
on
the
determination
that
it's
murder.
it's
irrelevant.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
if
it
was
an
intentional
killing,
it
would
be
classified
as
second
degree
murder,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
i'm
saying
a
felony
is
not
a
sufficient
aggravator
where
the
underlying
crime
is
felony
murder.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i'm
not
making
that
point
at
all.
the
felony
is
a
valid
aggravator
if
the
underlying
crime
is
not
felony
murder
the
only
constitutional
problem
with
this
is
it's...
well,
because
it
elevates
with
nothing
further.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
yes.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
is
it
irrational
to
say
that
the...
no.
in
fact,
traditionally
the
one
who
is
reckless
has
killed
recklessly
has
been
held
to
be
less
culpable
than
the
one
who
has
killed
premeditatively.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
well,
yes,
i
would.
i
think
arising
out
of
many
years
of
jurisprudence
is
that
felony
with
intent,
or
with...
no
intent,
or
with
recklessness,
the
only
way
they
are
made
as
equally
culpable
as
a
premeditated
murder
is
through
the
fact
of
a
felony.
this
elevates
them
to
the
equivalent
of
a
premeditated
murder--
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
--and
that's
the
way
the
tennessee
system
operates.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
absolutely
not.
that's
not
what
i'm
arguing.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
well,
what
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
said,
though,
is
that
they
can't
do
that
under
the
tennessee
constitution.
it's
irrational
under
the
tennessee
constitution
regardless
of
whether
it
is
under
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
david
c.
stebbins
thank
you.
