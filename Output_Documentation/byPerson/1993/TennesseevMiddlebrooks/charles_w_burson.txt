mr.
charles
w.
burson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
ask
the
court
today
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court
vacating
the
sentence
of
death
imposed
by
a
jury
on
donald
middlebrooks.
the
tennessee
death
penalty
system
achieves
the
goal
of
rational
and
principled
sentencing
in
which
only
those
truly
deserving
of
the
death
penalty
suffer
the
imposition
of
death.
the
central
procedural
components
of
the
system
are
narrowing,
particularized,
and
individualized
considerations
at
the
penalty
phase
and
proportionality
review
on
direct
appeal.
in
tennessee--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--your
honor,
the
comparative
proportionality
review
i
think
this
court
has
said
is
not
constitutionally
required.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
indicated
that
it
undertakes
both
types,
traditional
proportionality
as
well
as
comparative
proportionality.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
in
tennessee,
narrowing
first
occurs
when
murderers
who
might
otherwise
be
eligible
as
capital
offenders
are
excluded
by
definition
from
the
class
of
first
degree
murderers.
it
next
occurs
when
the
legislature
defines
specific
circumstances
of
first
degree
murder
for
which
death
may
be
imposed.
unless
the
jury
finds
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
such
a
circumstance
exists,
they
cannot
impose
death.
this
is
the
means
of
channeling
the
jury's
discretion
so
as
to
reduce
the
likelihood
of
death
being
imposed
for
irrelevant
or
constitutionally
impermissible
factors
such
as
race.
it's
the
state's
position
that
tennessee's
felony
murder
narrowing
device
serves
this
purpose
in
a
rational,
principled,
and
constitutionally
sufficient
manner.
it
is
rational
in
that
it
clearly,
objectively,
and
specifically
identifies
circumstances
of
first
degree
murder
that
do
not
embrace
all
first
degree
murders.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--and
we've
tried
to
kind
of
run
those
down,
and
they're
very
elusive.
the
classes
that
would
not
be
subject
to
first
degree
murder
would
be
simple
intent
murderers
as
well
as
those
who
murder
not
in
the
course
of
a
felony
that
might
be
extremely
reckless,
and
they
would
be
preexcluded
from
the
class
of
first
degree
murder.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no,
simple
intent
murder
does
not
come
within
first
degree
murder.
in
tennessee--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--oh,
no,
it's
excluded
by
definition
from
first
degree
murder.
i
said
that
that
is
a
group
of
murderers
that
might
otherwise
be
eligible
for
a
capital
offense,
but
that
are
excluded
from
the
definition
of
first
degree
murder.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
i
mean
that--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well,
that
you
have
an
intent...
no,
that
you
have
an
intent
to
kill
as
distinguished
from
premeditated,
deliberate,
and
wilful.
tennessee
has
actually
construed,
for
instance,
deliberated
that
you've
got
to
have
a
very
cool
purpose,
premeditated,
cannot
be
formed
in
an
instant,
it
has
to
be
formed
in
some
period
of
time
beyond
an
instant,
and
so
it
would
appear
that
what
we
would
think
of
as
a
straight
intent
murder,
with
intent
formed
in
an
instant,
which
many
jurisdictions
allow
under
premeditation,
would
be
precluded.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that's
correct.
it's
our
position
that
the
circumstance
is
rational
in
that
it
clearly,
objectively,
and
specifically
identifies
circumstances
of
first
degree
murder
that
don't
embrace
all
first
degree
murders.
it's
principled
in
that
it's
justifying--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
premeditated
and
deliberate
murders
are
not
embraced
and
also,
today,
child
abuse
murders
are
not
embraced
by
the
felony
murder
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
i'm
sorry
for
the
confusion,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
justice--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
the...
each...
if
you're
convicted
of
the
offense
of
first
degree
murder,
the
jury
has
two
choices,
life
or
death.
that's
the
same--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
and...
this...
mr.
chief
justice,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
basically
what
tennessee
does,
it
describes
first
degree
murder,
which
are
premeditated
murders,
felony
murders.
all
other
homicides,
all
other
murders
fall
below
the
line
into
second
degree
murder,
and
none
of
those
are...
is
it
possible
to
impose
the
death
penalty
on.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
it
narrows
the
class
of
first
degree
murders.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that
certainly
occurs
independent
of
the
aggravator,
and
we
would
contend
it
also
occurs
during
the
penalty
phase
when
the
jury
considers
all
of
the
factors
that
an
additional
narrowing
takes
place,
but
in
terms
of
the
recklessness
standard,
that's
constitutionally
required
by
tison,
and
it
does
restrict
the
state's
ability
to
impose
death
on
anyone
who
does
not
meet
that
standard.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
our
position
is
that
the
entire
system
accomplishes
that--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--as
an
aggravator--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes.
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
maybe,
and
maybe
not,
if
i
could
explain.
the
issue
with
premeditated
murder
would
be
different
than
the
issue
of
felony
murder.
the
issue
with
premeditated
murder
may
well
be
a
vagueness
issue,
depending
on
how
narrowly
the
state
would
define
its
premeditated
class.
it
would
not
be--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
think
in
recent
months
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
begun
to
very
narrowly
define
premeditated
murder,
and
i
think
it
is
possible
that
it
would
serve...
could
serve
as
a
valid
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
under...
yes,
under
tison
and
under
creech
and
godfrey.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no,
it--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--no.
if
i
might
explain,
and
i
think
it's
important,
we're
looking
at
an
entire
system.
the
aggravating
circumstance
has
the
purpose
of
narrowing
from
the
entire
class
of...
we're
saying
first
degree
murderers.
now,
it
does
that,
and
it
has
to
be...
do
that
in
a
principled...
on
a
principled
rationale,
and
those...
this
court
i
think
has
found
that
the
eighth
amendment
requires
deterrence,
or
retribution,
as
the
principal
basis
for
that
narrowing.
tison
is
a
component
of
the
system
which
is
more
or
less
the
safety
net
that
cuts
across
the
entire
system.
it
is
not
a
narrowing
device
necessarily
unto
itself.
it
sets
a
substantive,
constitutional
threshold
below
which
no
one
for
felony
murder
can
be
sentenced
to
death.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
i
don't
even
think
they
would
be
included
in
tison.
tison
was
addressing
the
participation
of
an
accomplice
in
a
felony
murder.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
but
again,
unless
premeditated
murder
were
a
felony
murder,
tison
really
isn't
applicable.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
but
a
pre...
someone
could
kill
in
a
premeditated
fashion
in
the
course
of
a
felony.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
or
they
could
be
convicted
of
premeditated
murder
and
be
subject
to
the
felony
murder
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--as
we've
discussed
it.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
would
not
agree
because
it
satisfies
tison,
but
i
would
agree
that
you
could
have,
in
the
way
we've
discussed
it,
a
premeditated,
aggravating
circumstance,
so
that--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--justice
souter,
i
guess...
and
i
don't
mean
to
pick
this
point,
but
tison
as
we
have
read
it
is
a
case
involving
the
standard,
the
threshold
standard
for
felony
murders
and
participants
in
felony
murder,
not
premeditated
murders,
and
that's
why--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--correct.
well,
it
would...
it
would...
an
intent
murder
or
a
premeditated
murder
by
the
very
definition
exceeds
the
tison
standard
of
recklessness.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
have
said--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
have
said...
that's
what
i
have
said.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
justice--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
we're
talking
about
in
premeditated
the
mens
rea
of
intent.
felony
murder
would
encompass
reckless...
extremely
reckless
murders
as
well
as
those
who
would
intend,
so
in
comparing
a
recklessness
mens
rea,
so
to
speak,
against
a
premeditated
mens
rea,
the
level
of
intent
would
have
to
be
greater
for
premeditated
murder.
however,
the
level
of
culpability,
these
are
all
first
degree
murder
offenses.
the
level
of
culpability
is
comparable
for
premeditated
murderers
and
for
felony
murderers,
and
what
the
legislature
in
tennessee
has
determined
is
that
deterrence
serves
as
a
justifying
rationale
to
create
an
aggravating
circumstance
of
felony
murder
as
a
class
of
murderers,
and
they
have
come
to
that
conclusion
with
certain
types
of
premeditated
murders
such
as
a
police
murder,
state
attorney
general
murder,
that
sort
of
thing,
which
are
purely
based
upon
deterrent
reasons.
but
when
i
suggest
that
the
premeditated
standard
as
intent
and
deliberateness
and
coolness
is
higher
than
recklessness,
i
only
mean
as
a
mens
rea,
not
in
terms
of
culpability.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
it
is
considered
the
offense
that
the
general
assembly
has
determined
they
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
deterring
by
increasing
the
severity
of
the
penalty
to
death.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's
more
severe
in
another
manner,
except
that
i
think
they
could
also
conclude
that
the
extent
of
harm
in
a
felony
murder
is
greater
than
in
a
straight,
premeditated
murder.
those
are
the
rationale
that
this
court
has
looked
at
in
terms
of
defining
the
aggravating
circumstance.
it's
our
position
that
the
tennessee
general
assembly
has
determined
that
as
to
felony
murderers,
and
at
the
general
level
of
definition
that's
all
that
they're
required
to
do.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
this
statute
i
think
was
in
'77
or
so,
and--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
think
that
the
recklessness
component
of
it
certainly
gives
it
a--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--it
comes
from...
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
to
the
extent--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--to
the
extent
it
would
have
applied
to
one
who
acts
less
than
reckless,
and
we
also
had--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--no,
but
i
think
the--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--the...
we
don't,
but
the
court
made
it
very
clear,
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
that
it
would
perform
this
type
of
proportionality
review,
and
i
think
this
court
said
in
cabana
v.
bullock
that
that
proportionality
review
was
not
required
by
the
jury,
that
it
was
sufficient
if
the
appellate
court
applied
the
tison
standard.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
yes,
and
the
tennessee
supreme--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--your,
honor,
i
can't
say
that
they
addressed
that.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no,
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
saying
the
tennessee
legislature
applied
the
deterrent
rationale
to
making
felony
murder
an
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
correct,
and
we
would
agree
that
they
are
equal
in
culpability.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
justice
souter,
our
position
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
allows
an
aggravator
to
have,
as
a
justifying
rationale,
deterrence--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--or
retribution,
so
you
do
not
have
to
set
up
an
aggravator
based
upon
culpability.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
let
me
see
if
i
could
respond
this
way.
if
the
two
categories
in
the
tennessee
system
were
premeditated
murder
and
the
killing
of
two
or
more
persons,
it
would
be
perfectly
rational
to
have
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
the
killing
of
two
or
more
persons
as
you
did
in
lowenfield,
and
so
it's...
what
you
have
to
look
at
for
an
aggravator,
we
would
suggest,
is
the...
are
the
objective
criteria
that
circumscribe
the
class
of
first
degree
murders.
in
this
case,
it's
the
conduct
of
felony
murder.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
if
you
are...
maybe
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
comparable.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
don't
know
how
to
say
it
any
other
way
than
i
have
said
it.
they
have
narrowed
it
and
decided
on
felony
murder
as
an
aggravator
based
upon
the
rationale
of
deterrence,
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
the
legislature
has
done
this,
and
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
says
that's
fine
as
far
as
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no,
then
i
was
misunderstood.
i
think
there
needs
to
be...
there
needs
to
be
an
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
and
then--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--oh,
i
see.
i
see.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
think
under
lowenfield
that's
possible,
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
think--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
think
under
lowenfield
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
would
suggest
that
not
if
it's...
not
as
a
constitutional
proposition.
not
if
it's
not
constitutionally
required.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
it
is--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--justice
kennedy,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that
is
my
position,
and
where
it
seems
to
me
we
are...
the...
we're
elevating
almost
form
over
substance.
this
is
what
lowenfield
got
away
from.
the
point
is
that
if
we
narrow
either
through
the
definitional
stage
or
if
it's
as
an
aggravator,
if
we
narrow
the
circumstances
as
justice
kennedy
has
noted,
and
that
is
a
sufficiently
discrete
sort
of
set
of
circumstances
to
guide
the
jury's
discretion,
and
that's
what
we're
after,
that
is
what...
that's
what
the
constitution
requires.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
you
mean,
and
you
are
an
accomplice,
or
you
are
the
killer?
mr.
charles
w.
burson
as
the
court's
formulation
of
the
standard
is
now,
yes,
because
the
court
just
says
you
have
to...
under
the
enmund
standard,
you
only
have
to
kill
and
it
doesn't
require...
the
court
hasn't
addressed
a
particular
standard,
but
clearly
an
accomplice
would
have
to
at
least
be
reckless
before
that
would
happen,
but
if
you
killed--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
the
court
would
not
apply
that
same
recklessness
standard,
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
probably--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--would
not
be
upheld.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
and
that's
overlaid
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
recklessness.
may
i
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please?
mr.
charles
w.
burson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
it's
our
position
that
following
lowenfield,
that
whether
you
call
it
an
aggravator,
if
it's...
if
the
circumstances
are
described
in
the
offense
itself
that
meet
the
goal
of
narrowing
the
jury's
discretion,
or
if
they're
described
in
an
aggravator,
that
fulfills
the
eighth
amendment
purpose--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--and
we
would
suggest--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes,
and
we
would
suggest
that
this
does.
going
to
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical,
this
hypothetical
proves
the
deficiency
in
the
tennessee
court
decision.
yes,
both
the
reckless
killer
and
the
intentional
killer
in
the
course
of
a
robbery,
house
robbery,
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
there's
nothing
constitutionally
that
says
they
shouldn't
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
and
tennessee
did
not...
this
is
the
point.
they
did
not
invalidate
the
felony
murder
aggravator,
or
the
felony
murder
aggravating
circumstance.
what
they
have
done
is
exactly
what
the
last
part
of
the
discussion
was.
after
saying
in
the
opinion,
and
after
this
court
has
said
previously,
particularly
in
tison,
that
a
reckless
killer
can
be
equally
culpable
to
a
premeditated
killer,
the
tennessee
court,
in
discussing
the
constitutionality
of
death
for
felony
murder,
said
the
exact
same
thing,
and
now
what
they're
suggesting
is
that
you've
got
to...
you
are
more
culpable
in
some
way
if
the
murder
was
premeditated.
it
would
have
been
one
thing
if
they
had
invalidated
the
felony
murder
aggravator,
or
the
use
of
felony
murder
as
a
death-eligible
device,
but
they
didn't,
and
that
is
the
illogic
of
the
opinion,
starting
from
the
premise
that
they
are
equally
culpable.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
think
it's
clear
in
the
opinion
of
the
case
that
what
it
said
is
that
recklessness
could
be
equally
culpable
to
premeditated
murders,
and
there
were
a
number
of
examples,
and
this
case,
this
case
proves
that
point.
there
could
be--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--in
this--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes.
in
this
case
there
was
another
aggravating
circumstance
of
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
it
certainly
doesn't,
but
if
this
killing
were
reckless,
if
this
person
plunged
a
knife
into
the
chest
of
this
person
recklessly
and
not
with
premeditation,
then
that
certainly
proves
the
point
that
this
recklessness
could
rise
to
the
culpability
of
any
intentional
killing,
or
any
premeditated
killing.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
