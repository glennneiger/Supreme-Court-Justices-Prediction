mr.
stebbins,
i
thought
tennessee
had
not
opened
up
every
felony
murder
to
the
death
penalty
but
only
the
commission
of
murder
in
the
course
of
committing
certain
named
felonies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
has
been
a
narrowing.
it
isn't
all
felonies,
it
is
certain
named
felonies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
of
course,
lowenfield
says
that
the
narrowing
can
be
done
at
the
guilt
phase.
i
mean,
there's
no...
we've
never
said
there
is
a
requirement
that
it
has
to
be
done
at
the
sentencing
phase,
have
we?
