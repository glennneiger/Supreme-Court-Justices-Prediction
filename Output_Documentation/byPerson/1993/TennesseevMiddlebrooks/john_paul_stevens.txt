justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
simple
intent
murder,
just
to...
what
is
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
intent
to
kill?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
murders
that
are
eligible
are
all
premeditated
murders
and
all
felony
murders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
the
felony
murder
category,
as
the
statute
was
at
the
time
of
this
crime,
it
did
not
require
intent
to
kill,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--general
burson,
when
did
the
general
assembly
make
this
determination?
when
was
this
statute
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
passed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
this
murder
had
taken
place
before
1987,
when
tison
was
decided?
say
you
had
this
very
same
set
of
facts
in
1980.
could
you
have
then
defended
this
scheme
as
constitutional,
because
there's
nothing
in
the
tennessee
statute
that
requires
recklessness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
does
the
requirement
to
satisfy
a
recklessness
component
come
from?
isn't
it
tison?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
you
didn't
have
tison
on
the
books,
which
wasn't
decided
till
1987,
your
statute
was
then
unconstitutional,
i
assume.
it
became--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--constitutional
once
tison
was
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
we
have
no
finding
of
recklessness
in
this
case,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
there's
no
such
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
at
least
it
isn't
the
tennessee
legislature
that
required
the
recklessness
requirement.
that
much
we
all
agree
on,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well
then,
do
you
contend
it
would
be
constitutional
to
have
the
death
penalty
imposed
for
a
felony
murder
that
the
only
intent...
there's
no
recklessness
involved.
the
only
intent
was
to
commit
a
robbery.
would
that
be
constitutional?
to
commit
a
robbery,
and
in
the
course
of
the
robbery
a
person
gets
killed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
a
robber,
and
in
the
course
of
the
robbery,
maybe
you
stumble,
and
you
accidentally
shoot
the
gun
and
the
man
gets
killed.
that's
a
clear
case
of
felony
murder
with
no
intent
to
kill,
no
recklessness,
let's
assume.
would
you
say
that
could
constitutionally
support
the
death
penalty?
under
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
i
think
you'd
say
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
no
recklessness
on
the
part
of
the
killer.
he
just
had
an
intent
to
commit
the
felony,
and
all
of
the
deterrence
rationale
you
talked
about
would
apply
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
the
extent--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
your
narrowing
requirement
under
your
statute.
all
you
have
to
do
is
be
a
participant
in
a
felony
murder
where
all
you
intended
to
do
was
to
commit
the
felony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stebbins,
can
i
just
interrupt
you
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
made
a
motion
on
this
point
that
i
think
the
court
denied,
and
your
position
is
fully
stated
in
your
brief,
so
i
wonder
if
you're
making
the
best
use
of
your
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
about
a
felony
murderer
who
in
one
case
is
reckless
and
in
the
other
case
deliberately
kills--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
say
that
it's
irrational
to
say
that
the
one
who
is
reckless
is
less
culpable
than
the
one
who
killed
deliberately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
the
contrary
view
would
be
irrational,
and
if
you
don't
say
it,
why
don't
you
say
it?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
hold--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
part
of
lowenfield
that
says
to
pass
constitutional
muster
a
capital
sentencing
scheme
must
genuinely
narrow
the
class
of
persons
eligible
for
the
death...
you
agree
with
that,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general,
do
you
think
that
tison
holds
that
recklessness
is
equally
culpable
with
intent,
or
does
it
merely
hold
that
the
recklessness
in
that
case
was
sufficient
to
cross
the
constitutional
threshold?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
case
there
were
three
other
aggravating
circumstances--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
tison.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
doesn't
depend
on
that.
