chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
92-989,
tennessee
v.
donald
ray
middlebrooks.
general
burson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
you
ever
held
that
proportionality
review
is
constitutionally
required?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
just
describing
the
tennessee--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--system.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
burson,
how
are
you
defining
first
degree
murder
if
simple
intent
murder
comes
within
first
degree
murder?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
it
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
again,
you
say
circumstances
of
first
degree
murder
that
don't
embrace
all--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--first
degree
murder.
what
first
degree
murders
are
not
embraced?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
by
the
felony
murder--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
entirely
correct,
general
burson?
certainly
there
are
some
homicides
that
are
not
death-eligible
in
tennessee,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
to
say
that
there
is
some
narrowing
there,
would
there
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
would
carry
justice
stevens'
analogy
back,
you
might
say
that
before
this
court
decided
enmund
in
1983,
maybe
from
1977
to
1983
the
statute
was
constitutional,
from
1983
to
1987
it
wasn't,
and
after
1987
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
burson.
mr.
stebbins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you...
where...
what
cases
of
ours
do
you
rely
on
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
this
sort
of
rationality
requirement
in
the
eighth
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
where
you
derive
the
rationality
requirement
from
then,
in
the
eighth
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
saying
that
in
a...
let's
take
a
totally
hypothetical
situation,
unlike
tennessee,
that
a
state
cannot
make
a
felony
murder
that
qualifies
under
tison's
recklessness,
they
cannot
make
that
a
capital
offense
without
some
aggravating
circumstance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
case
would
you
rely
on
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
asked
you
for
a
case
from
this
court
that
supports
the
answer
that
you
just
gave,
and
to
say
that
the
states
have
required
something
more
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
constitution
requires
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
don't
you
think
it
represents
a
sufficient
narrowing
in
the
terms
that
lowenfield
used
that
if
they
say...
if
the
state
says,
from
all
homicides
we
are
going
to
choose
premeditated
murder
and
felony
murder
that
meets
the
tison
qualification,
and
we're
not
going
to
have
aggravating
circumstances.
we're
going
to
let
you
show
all
the
mitigating
evidence
you
want.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
never
have,
but
has
it
ever
disapproved
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
arave,
mr.
stebbins,
the
challenge
was
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
was
too
vague,
wasn't
it?
it
wasn't
whether
you
had
to
have
an
aggravating
circumstance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how...
are
you
sure
that's
the
correct
answer,
mr.
stebbins?
certainly,
at
common
law,
justice
souter's
hypothesis,
intentional
but
not
premeditated
killing
was
traditional
second
degree
murder.
tennessee
doesn't
regard
that
as
murder?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
may
have
misunderstood
his--
--no,
my
hypo
was,
it
is
a
nonpremeditated
killing,
and
it
is
not
committed
in
the
course
of
one
of
the
listed
felonies.
can
that
be
murder
under
tennessee
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stebbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
burson,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
burson.
the
case
is
submitted.
