justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
in
terms
of
those
that
are
above
the
line,
with
respect
to
the
felony
murder
category,
i
take
it
you
agree
that
the
felony
murder
aggravator,
so-called,
does
no
further
narrowing?
we
don't
have
any
disagreement
about
that,
do
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
once
it
is...
once
the
murder
is
classified
as
a
felony
murder,
once
the
jury
has
come
in
with
a
verdict
to
felony
murder--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
opposed
to
premeditated
murder,
then
the
possible
application
later
of
the
felony
murder
aggravator,
so-called,
does
not
narrow
that
subset
of
first
degree
murders,
i.e.
felony
murders,
any
further.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
agree
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
there
is
a
further
narrowing
which
is
constitutionally
sufficient,
and
that
further
narrowing
is
the
result
of
applying,
in
effect,
the
tison
standard,
the
threshold
proportionality
standard
that
tison
imposed,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
application
of
the
tison
standard
satisfies
the
constitutional
requirement
of
narrowing?
once
that
standard
has
been
applied,
no
further
narrowing
need
take
place
constitutionally,
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
you
give
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me,
general,
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
give
me
a
yes
or
no
answer?
is
it
constitutionally
sufficient
to
apply
the
tison
standard
such
that
no
further
narrowing
is
constitutionally
required?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
does
it
follow
from
that,
then,
that
no
narrowing
need
take
place
in
the
category
of
premeditated
murders,
because
i
assume
premeditated
murders
at
least
satisfy
the
kind
of
proportionality
threshold
that
tison
was
trying
to
get
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
think
that
your
premeditated
class
is
vaguely
defined?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that,
again,
if
it
satisfied...
if
premeditated...
if
the
class
of
premeditated
murder
is
so
defined
as
to
pass
muster
under
tison,
no
further
narrowing
would
be
required
constitutionally.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
tison
has
basically,
on
your
view,
superseded
the
narrowing
requirement,
hasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
satisfy
tison
you're
home
free
so
far
as
narrowing
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
i
would
take
it
that
as
a
general
proposition,
all
first
degree
murders
would...
let's
just
stick
to
premeditated
for
a
moment.
i
would
say
as
a
general
proposition
that
all
premeditated
murders
would
satisfy
tison's
threshold
requirement,
would
you
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
premeditated
at
least
by
the
tennessee
definition
is
not
a...
could
not
be
a
felony
murder.
i
mean,
felony
murder
is
not
defined
that
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
just
be
convicted
of
felony
murder,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
in
which
case...
but
that's
not
the
case
before
us,
because
in
that
case
a
further
narrowing
would
in
fact
be
taking
place.
so
go
back
to
the
premeditated
murder
category
itself.
as
a
general
proposition,
you
agree
that
that
would
satisfy
tison.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
does
it
not
follow
from
the
position
you're
taking
with
respect
to
tison's
application
to
felony
murder
that
no
further
narrowing
need
take
place
in
the
premeditated
murder
category
because
it
satisfies
tison.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
one
thing
i'm
just
not
getting,
then.
if
tison
is
not
sufficient
in
premeditated,
why
is
tison
sufficient
to
satisfy
narrowing
in
felony
murder,
or
do
i
misunderstand
your
position
that
it
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it's
applying...
it's
applying
an
eighth
amendment
threshold,
and
the
eighth
amendment
threshold
would
apply
to
any
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
exactly,
so
that
if
tison
is
your
means
of
satisfying
for
felony
murder,
and
a
premeditated
murder
always
exceeds
the
tison
threshold,
then
doesn't
it
follow
that
there
need
be
no
further
narrowing
in
a
premeditated
murder
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
among
the
class--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
tennessee
supreme
court
did
address
the
question
of
the
relative
culpability
of
premeditated
murder
and
felony
murder,
didn't
it,
and
it
found
them
equal
in
culpability
under
the
statute,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
aren't
you...
doesn't
that
then
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
of
a
moment
ago?
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
of
two
categories
of
murder
of
equal
culpability,
the
defendants
convicted
in
the
one
category,
premeditated,
require...
are
subject
to
a
narrowing
requirement
and
those
in
the
second
category,
felony,
are
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm...
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
answer,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that
responds
to
the
question.
you're
still,
under
your
law,
engaging
in
a
narrowing
function
with
respect
to
one
category,
and
you're
not
engaging
in
a
narrowing
function
with
respect
to
the
other,
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
still
don't...
maybe
i'm
missing
a...
i
don't
think
you've
answered
justice
ginsburg's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
her
question
was...
in
any
case,
my
question
is,
as
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
has
construed
it,
the
two
subcategories
are
first
degree
murder
of
equal
culpability,
isn't
that...
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
you
narrow--
justice
david
h.
souter
--those
convicted
in
the
one
category,
you
don't
of
those
convicted
in
the
other.
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
you
don't?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stebbins--
justice
david
h.
souter
--just
a
question
of
tennessee
law.
is
a
nonpremeditated
killing
in
the
course
of
a
felony,
other
than
those
listed,
murder
under
tennessee
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
an
unlisted
felony.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
wouldn't
be
murder
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
is
a
narrowing,
then,
that
does
indeed
go
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
fact
of
the
felony
would
be
irrelevant,
but
it
would
still
be
classified
as
murder
if
it
was
an
intentional
killing.
