the
second
case
is
hagen
against
utah
which
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
utah.
the
petitioner,
hagen,
a
native
american
was
charged
in
utah
state
court
with
distributing
a
controlled
substance
in
the
town
of
myton,
utah.
myton
is
within
the
original
boundaries
of
the
uintah
indian
reservation,
but
it
is
situated
on
land
that
was
opened
to
non-indian
settlement
in
1905.
the
state
appellate
court
relying
on
a
prior
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
myton
was
an
"indian
country"
as
that
term
is
defined
by
statute
and,
therefore,
that
the
state
courts
lack
jurisdiction
over
the
petitioner.
the
utah
supreme
court
reversed
holding
that
congress
had
diminished
the
reservation
boundaries
by
opening
the
reservation
to
non-indian
settlement
and
that
myton
was
outside
the
boundaries
of
the
present
reservation
and,
thus,
petitioner's
offense
was
subject
to
state
criminal
jurisdiction.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm.
we
decline
to
consider
petitioner's
argument
that
the
state
of
utah
should
be
collaterally
estopped
from
relitigating
the
reservation
boundaries.
that
argument
was
not
presented
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
indeed,
was
expressly
disavowed
by
petitioner
at
an
earlier
stage
in
this
litigation.
on
the
merits,
prior
decisions
have
established
that
three
factors
are
relevant
to
the
determination
whether
congress
has
diminished
a
reservation
boundary.
we
look
to
the
statutory
language
used
opening
the
indian
lands
to
settlement.
we
looked
to
the
contemporaneous
understanding
of
that
statute
and
we
look
to
the
subsequent
demographics
of
the
area.
any
ambiguities
are
resolved
in
favor
of
the
indians.
in
this
case,
a
1902
statute
provided
that
the
open
lands
shall
be
restored
to
the
public
domain.
this
language
evidences
a
congressional
purpose
to
terminate
reservation
status
to
that
land.
this
baseline
intent
to
diminish
was
not
changed
by
the
subsequent
passage
of
the
1905
statute
that
actually
opened
the
reservation
lands
for
settlement.
the
statutory
language
and
structure,
we
think,
requires
that
the
two
acts
be
read
together.
the
historical
evidence
clearly
indicates
the
contemporaneous
understanding
that
the
reservation
would
be
diminished
in
size.
finally,
practical
acknowledgment
that
the
reservation
was
diminished
is
demonstrated
by
the
current
population
demographics
in
the
disputed
area.
