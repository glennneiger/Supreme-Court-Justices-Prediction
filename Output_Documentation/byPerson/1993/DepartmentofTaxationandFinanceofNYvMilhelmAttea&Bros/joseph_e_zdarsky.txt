mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
court's
decisions
in
warren
trading
post
v.
arizona
tax
commission,
and
central
machinery
company
v.
arizona
tax
commission.
both
of
those
cases
held
that
trade
with
indians
is
preempted
by
the
federal
indian
trader
laws,
and
that
there
is
no
room
whatsoever
for
any
additional
or
supplementary
state
burdens
on
trade
with
indians.
one
factual
matter
that
is
important
to
stress
is
that
the
respondents
are
wholesale
distributors
whose
only
sales
on
reservations
in
new
york
are
to
indians...
indian
retail
vendors
that
purchase
from
us
pursuant
to
the
indian
trader
laws
and
regulations
which
we
must
comply
with
with
respect
to
all
of
those
transactions.
it
is
a
separate
and
distinct
transaction
from
the
subsequent
retail
sales
of
which
my
learned
colleague
complains,
and
it
is
our
view
that
this
court
has
sustained
in
the
moe,
colville,
and
potawatomi
cases,
reasonable,
minimal
burdens
on
retail
transactions
between
an
indian
vendor
and
a
non-indian
customer
who
comes
on
the
reservation,
but
that
the
court
has
made
it
very
clear
in
warren
trading
post
and
central
machinery
that
no
burdens
whatsoever
may
be
imposed
on
the
sale
to
an
indian,
and
that's
the
business
we
have.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
they
are
in
the
sense
that
they--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--correct.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
insofar
as
they
sell
to
indians,
they
are
indian
traders.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
no,
sir.
your
honor,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
regulation
of
the
wholesale
indian
trader,
his
indian
customer
who
purchases
goods
from
him,
both
of
those
parties
and
that
transaction
are
regulated
by
federal
law,
and
that
the
federal
law
does
not
provide
for
the
addition
of
state
taxes
at
the
time
goods
are
sold
by
an
indian
trader
to
another
indian.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
that
you
did
was
because
sales
to
non-indians
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
indian
trader
laws.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
i
think...
well,
your
honor,
i
would
trust
your
recollection,
but
my
belief
is
that
in
moe
or
colville
the
court
specifically
noted
that
the
indian
trader
laws
and
regulations
did
not
preempt
the
enforcement
of
the
tax
at
the
retail
level
because
it
was
a
sale
to
a
non-indian,
and
that
there
was
an
important
distinction
between
congress'
intention
to
comprehensively
regulate
sales
to
indians
and
sales
to
non-indians
where
there
is
no
such
intent.
i
think
that
was
set
forth
in
the
colville
case
which
followed
moe,
so
the
indian
trader
laws,
insofar
as
moe
was
concerned,
i
can't
recall
whether
they
were
raised,
but
i
believe
that
the
court
made
the
observation
in
both
cases
that
these
were
sales
to
non-indians,
and
the
problem
with
counsel's
argument
is
that
he
would
have
this
court
ignore
the
fact
that
there
is
an
intervening
transaction
between
the
respondents
and
the
indians
and
the
non-indians
who
purchase
on
the
reservation.
that
intervening
transaction
is
a
sale
to
an
indian,
and
the
regulation
which
new
york
has
adopted
imposed
significant
burdensome
requirements
on
both
parties
to
that
regulation...
to
that
sale.
the
wholesaler
must
be
a
licensed
new
york
state
tax
agent.
even
if
he
has
no
sales
to
anyone
in
new
york
except
indians
on
reservations,
he
must
be
a
new
york
state
tax
agent.
the
retail--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--he
said...
he
said--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--your
honor,
i
believe
what
he
meant
was
that
no
license
would
be
required
if
he
sold
only
to
indians
who
in
turn
sold
only
to
indians.
when
he
refers
to
sales
only
to
indians,
as
he
did
in
several
points
in
his
argument,
he
was
looking
past
the
retail
vendor
at
the
ultimate
purchaser.
we
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
that
ultimate
purchaser.
our
clients,
the
respondents,
don't
make
retail
sales
to
non-indians
on
reservations.
we
don't
have
places
of
business
on
the
reservations.
our
only
transactions
are
sales
to
indians
on
the
reservations,
and
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
found
that
warren
trading
post
and
central
machinery
controlled
in
this
instance.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
all
of
the
retailers
are
indians,
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
there's
not
a
requirement,
although
i
think
in
most--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--in
most
cases
on
reservations
in
new
york
the
tribal
governments
would
not
approval
a
non-indian
conducting
a
retail
operation
on
a
reservation,
so
in
this
case
all
of
the
retail
vendors,
all
of
our
purchasers,
are
indians,
and
the
problem
with--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
but
that's
not
all
the
state
is
doing
here.
the
state
is
imposing
the
tax
one
step
further
back
in
the
distribution
chain
at
the
time
of
the
wholesale
transaction.
section
471
of
the
new
york
tax
law
imposes
a
tax
at
the
time
of
the
sale
by
the
respondents
to
their
indian
purchasers.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
that's
true,
and
that's
what
their
claim
is,
but
frankly,
we
have
no
way
of
determining
whether
that
is
a
reasonable
scheme.
there
are
no
procedures--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
a
substantial
problem.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
because
this
court
has
recognized
that
regulating
trade
with
indians
is
a
federal
matter.
it
is
so
because
there
should
be
consistency,
because
the
federal
government
has
a
responsibility
to
indians,
because
the
federal
government
has
experience
in
regulating
these
matters,
and
therefore
there
is
a
uniform
scheme
that
applies
to
regulating
people
who
sell
to
indians.
that
scheme,
for
better
at
worse,
at
this
point
does
not
include
the
right
of
a
state
to
impose
a
tax
and
require
the
indian
trader
to
include
that
tax
in
the
price
of
the
goods
and
require
his
indian
purchaser
to
pay
it.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
reading
of
the
case.
our
view
of
that
case
was
that
the
rationale
for
excluding
the
warren
trading
post
holding
was
that
the
sales
that
were
being
regulated
were
simply
the
retail
sales,
and
what
the
court
held
in
moe
was
that
the
state
could
require
the
retail
vendor
to
simply
add
the
price,
add
the
tax
to
the
price
that
he
charges
his
retail
customer,
and
collect
the
tax
at
the
time
of
the
retail
sale.
the
court
was
careful
to
stop
short
of
endorsing
a
scheme
that
required
the
indian
to
pay
that
tax,
or
that
endorsed
any
procedure
where
the
indian
would
be
required
to
front
that
tax
to
the
wholesaler,
or
anything
that
would
require
that
the
indian
otherwise
be
burdened.
it
was
a
very
minimal
thing
that
only
applied
at
the
retail
level,
and
it
is
important
to
note
in
this
context,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
while
we
obtained
in
injunction
in
1989
that
enjoined
the
state
from
enforcing
these
regulations
as
against
the
respondents
and
their
sales
to
indians
at
wholesale,
there
was
no
injunction
that
prohibited
the
state
from
taking
any
other
action
that
has
been
suggested
by
this
court
in
its
prior
cases,
including
requiring
retailers--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--i
do
contend
there
is
conflict.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
well,
that's
our
principal
argument,
that
the
field
has
been
preempted.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
yes,
justice
stevens.
the
federal
indian
trader
laws
provide
that
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs,
now
the
department
of
interior,
has
the
sole
authority
to
determine
price,
quantity,
and
the
kind
of
goods
sold
on
reservations.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
it
certainly
does,
sir.
the
statute
which
new
york
is
seeking
to
enforce
and
apply
here...
section
471...
specifically
requires
that
the
tax
be
paid
by
the
indian
as
part
of
the
price.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
it
is
part
of
the
price,
and
that
is
specifically
expressly
provided
in
the
new
york
statute,
and
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
past,
a
tax
law--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--yes,
i
think
there
would,
because
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
mississippi
tax
commission
cases,
which
dealt
with
an
analogous
circumstance...
sales
to
a
federal
instrumentality...
there
was
a
wholesale
markup
that
was
charged
on
sales
by
out-of-state
distributors
to
military
bases
within
the
state
of
mississippi.
this
court
held
that
because
the
mississippi
law
required
that
that
markup
be
included
in
the
price
charged
to
the
military
base
and
paid
by
the
federal
government
at
the
time
of
purchase,
that
it
as
a
matter
of
law
was
a
tax
on
the
federal
government,
and
struck
down
that
requirement,
so
whether
you
call
it
a
tax,
a
markup,
a
surcharge--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--well--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--we
are
not
involved
in
that
subsequent
transaction.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
mr.
justice
stevens,
our
position
is
that
the
sales
to
the
retail
customer
do
not
determine
the
preemptive
effect
of
the
indian
trader
laws
on
the
wholesale
transaction.
therefore--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--no,
because
as
i
understand
it,
insofar
as
retailers
are
selling
to
non-indians,
by
electing
to
sell
to
both
indians
and
non-indians,
this
court
has
found
that
those
sales
that
to
non-indians,
since
they
are
not
covered
by
the
indian
trader
laws,
that
permits
the
state
to
impose
a
minimal
burden
on
that
retail
seller.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
that's...
that's--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
i
agree.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
i
think
that
that's
true,
your
honor,
because
congress
has
not
authorized
the
states--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--to
enforce
those
laws.
however,
congress
has
authorized
states
to
enforce
its
own
liquor
laws
with
respect
to
liquor
sales,
certain
sanitary
codes
which
may
have
application
on
the
reservation,
and
in
numerous
other
cases.
our
view
here
is
that
the
state
has
come
to
the
wrong
place
with
its
problem.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
i
think
that
the
commissioner
could
adopt
a
regulation,
justice
ginsburg,
that
provides
for
a
scheme
that
would
affect
trade
with
indians.
i
don't
think
the
commissioner
could
delegate
to
the
states
some
power
that
they
would
have
to
adopt
a
scheme
on
their
own,
but
a
scheme
that
the
commissioner
found
proper
might
well
be
imposed
as
a
regulation,
because
the
commissioner
has
sole
authority
over
sales
to
indians
on
reservations,
and
he
can
do
that.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
who's
not
an
indian?
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
you
would
not
be.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
you
would
not
be
an
indian
trader
as
to
that
transaction,
because
that
transaction
is
not
covered
by
the
indian
trader
statutes
or
regulations.
that
transaction
is
the
same
as
if
we
sold
it--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
indian
trader
laws
and
regulations
don't
provide
that
the
coverage
at
the
wholesale
level
is
determined
by
something
that
happens
at
a
subsequent
event
at
the
retail
level.
how
could
we
ever,
as
wholesalers,
be
bound
to
monitor
transactions
which
take
place
by
people...
we
have
30
or
40
customers
on
our
reservation.
some
may
sell
to
the
non-indians,
some
may
not.
the
state
claims
they
can't
monitor
it,
but
they
would
like,
in
their
reply
brief,
to
impose
on
us
as
the...
on
the
respondents
as
the
wholesaler
some
obligation,
some
contingent
liability
to
be
responsible
for
what
happens
to
those
cigarettes
down
the
chain.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
i
think
that
would
be
worse,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
yes,
because
every
dollar
that
our
customer
must
commit
to
paying
tax
to
us
as
opposed
to
purchasing
product
limits
the
ability
of
the
wholesaler
to
sell
goods
to
that
customer.
if
he
has
$1,000
to
commit
to
buying
cigarettes,
and
he
has
to
commit
$200
of
it
to
paying
a
state
tax
to
us,
he
could
purchase...
he
can't
purchase
as
much
as
he
could
otherwise.
our
position
is
that
the
state
cannot
impose
any
burden
on
our
sales
to
our
customers.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
but
that
isn't
our...
that
isn't
our
doing,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
no,
i
do
not,
justice
ginsburg.
the
state
is
not
helpless,
but
they
have
taken
no
action,
as
suggested
by
this
court,
since
the
injunction
was
granted
in
1989,
to
try
to
collect
these
taxes.
they
haven't
tried
to
impose
a
scheme
at
the
retail
level
that
might
be
possible,
although
the
indians
claim
some
treaty
rights.
they
have
not
attempted
to
enter
into
a
tax
compact
with
the
tribes
that
might
solve
the
problem,
and,
even
though
they've
got
13
or
14
states
filing
amicus
briefs,
numerous
political
heavyweights
filing
amicus
briefs,
they
haven't
gone
to
congress,
which
this
court
has
suggested
is
the
place
to
go
if
you've
got
a
problem
with
the
indian
trader
laws.
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
because,
your
honor,
we
do
not
agree
that
we
are
in
a
derivative
position.
we
don't
have
any
involvement
or
participation
with
the
retail
transaction.
we
are
as
separate
from
that
as
when
we
sell
to
the
coast
guard
base,
or
we
sell
to
the
air
force
base.
we
have
no
control
over
those
cigarettes
which
are
sold
without
taxes
if
they
are
sold
to
members
of
the
family
at
a
px
that
are
not
permitted
to
purchase,
we
don't
have
that
control,
and
we
don't
have
any
derivative
responsibility
as
it
exists
now
under
new
york
law.
new
york
law
is
set
up
to
provide
for
imposition
of
the
tax
at
the
wholesale
level.
that
is
our
complaint.
that
is
why
we
brought
this
lawsuit,
because--
mr.
joseph
e.
zdarsky
--because
our
position,
your
honor,
is
based
on
the
fact
that
we
are
selling
to
an
indian,
that
indian
transaction,
that
sale
transaction
cannot
be
regulated
by
the
state,
and
that
therefore
we
are
not
responsible
for
the
taxes
from
that
point
on.
