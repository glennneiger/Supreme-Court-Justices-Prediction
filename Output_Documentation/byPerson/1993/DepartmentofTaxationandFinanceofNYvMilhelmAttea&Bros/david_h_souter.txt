and
the
retailers
would
have
to
be
licensed
as
well,
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--they
would
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
fee
or
not,
let
me
ask
the
same
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
koppell.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question,
i
think
perhaps,
or
get
to
the
same
point
that
justice
o'connor
has
in
mind.
can
we
decide
this
case
strictly
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
an
impermissible
limitation
on
quantities
that
may
be
sold,
or
is
it
impossible
to
determine...
to
resolve
that
issue
without
getting
into
questions
of
registration,
licensing,
and
so
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
your
answer
is
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
can
decide
it
strictly
on
the
issue
of
quantity.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
all
we
have
to
decide.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
more
that
we
have
to
reach?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can't
resist
this
question,
when
you
speak
of
the
huge
amount
of
evasion.
do
you
accept
the
figure
that
was
in
the...
i
guess
the
tobacco
retailers
and
candy
distributors
brief
that
the...
at
the
present
time
the
average
number
of
packs
supposedly
sold
to
every
man,
woman,
or
consumed
by
every
man,
woman
and
child
on
the
reservations
is
12,800
a
year?
is
that
figure
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
also
implicitly
saying,
leaving
aside
legislation
and
agreements,
you
are
implicitly
saying,
or
explicitly
saying,
that
some
action
could
be
taken
directly
against
the
indians
with
respect
to
the
non-indian
sales,
and
since
you
are
in
a
derivative
position,
why
aren't
you
just
as
open
to
such
action
as
the
retailers
would
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
aren't
you
in
a
derivative
position
simply
because
ultimately
your
complaint
rests
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
a
limitation
or
a
tax
upon
an
indian
sale
which
in
fact
is
prohibited?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
then
take
on
the
attorney
general
in
his
view
of
the
narrowness
of
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
we
cannot
decide
it
as
narrowly
as
he
said.
will
you
explain
why
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
to
the
respondents'
position
that
there's
nothing
derivative
about
his
rights?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
it
doesn't
want
to,
it
seems
to
me
it
can
stonewall
the
whole
thing
by
saying
yes,
you
can
precollect,
but
we're
simply
not
going
to
give
you
the
figures
upon
which
you
can
base
a
precollection,
and
because
the
other
aspects
of
the
scheme
have
been
held
to
be
unduly
onerous,
that's
the
end
of
the
precollection
scheme.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
fine,
except
that
i
think,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
you're
saying
the
state
would
simply
go
to
a
different
collection
scheme.
it
wouldn't
base
its
collection
scheme
upon
a
burden
placed
upon
the
wholesaler.
it
would
place
the
burden
directly
on
the
retailer.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
an
incident
of
this
taxation
scheme.
