i
assume
this
could
be
a
problem
for
any
new
york
sales
taxes,
couldn't
it?
it
just
so
happens
that
tax
is
particularly
high
on
cigarettes,
and
that's
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
why
the
problem
only
arises
with
cigarettes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
could
happen
for
sales
of
other
goods
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
probably
solve
the
problem
by
lowering
the
taxes.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
indian
vendor
that
you
refer
to,
the
retailers,
they
are
indian
traders
too,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
the
act
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
qualify
under
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
the
retailers
on
the
reservations
are
non-indians?
all
of
the
retailers
are
indians?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
requirement,
or
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
practice,
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
you
sell
only
to
indians.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
principal
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
zdarsky,
do
you
think
that
if
you
were
selling
to
a
retailer
who
was
not
an
indian...
hypothetically.
you
say
you
don't
have
any...
but
if
you
were,
would
you
be
an
indian
trader?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
sell
onto
the
reservation,
to
a
retailer
on
the
reservation,
but
that
retailer
is
not
an
indian.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
resale...
even
though
the
sale
is
onto
the
reservation
and
it's
known
that
the
resale
will
be
made
to
indians,
among
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
could
see
how
you
can
say
that
if
you
also
took
the
position
that
you
can't
make
them
prepay
taxes,
but
it
seems
to
me
rather
strange
to
say
that
it's
not
an
impermissible
burden
to
make
them
prepay
taxes
that
are
really
owed
by
somebody
else,
but
that
they
cannot
be
forced
to
comply
with
relatively
minimal
record-keeping
requirements.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i'm
not
sure
what
you
just
said.
you
would
regard
a
person
to
be
an
indian
trader--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
he
wholesales
to
a
non-indian
who
retails--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
have
a
case
for
that,
that
wholesaling
to
a
non-indian
retailer
makes
you
a--
