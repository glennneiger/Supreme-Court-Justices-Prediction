justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
koppell,
may
i
ask
you
if
this
case
was
litigated
below
at
all
on
the
notion
that
the
new
york
statute
is
severable,
that
there
are
a
variety
of
provisions
in
it,
and
that
some
of
them
should
survive
even
if
others
do
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
the
statute
severable,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
provision
requiring
licensing
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
wholesaler,
is
that
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
koppell,
are
there
federal
taxes
imposed
on
the
cigarettes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
handled
by
any
kind
of
a
stamp
mechanism?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
koppell,
does
the
same
problem
exist
with
regard
to
other
products
that
are
sold
on
the
reservation,
for
instance,
in
discount
stores
on
major
appliances
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
the
same
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there,
new
york
has
no
scheme
for
advance
payment
of
taxes,
presumably.
there's
no
stamp
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
you
would
have
to
impose
any
record-keeping
on
the
retailer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
that
general
koppell
said
that
no
license
would
be
required
for
a
wholesaler
who
sold
only
to
indians.
i
heard
him
say
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well
now...
now,
has
this
court
indicated
that
a
state
can
even
require
an
indian
retailer
to
assume
minimum
burdens
of
record-keeping
and
the
collection
and
payment
to
the
state
of
taxes
on
sales
by
the
indian
retailer
to
non-indians?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
state
says
that's
all
their
doing
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
say
they
are
only
taxing
based
on
projected
sales
to
non-indians.
that's
their
scheme,
anyway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
that's
true...
if
that's
true,
is
there
a
problem
under
our
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
tax
can
be
collected
in
advance
of
the
sale
by
the
state,
if
it's
a
sale
to
a
non-indian?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
mere
fact
that
it's
collected
in
advance
and
is
in
turn
transmitted
by
an
indian
retailer
does
not
invalidate
the
state
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
argument
being
made
by
mr.
zdarsky
is
that
the
difference
is
it
can
only
be
collected
at
the
time
of
sale,
and
no
advance
payment
of
the
tax
can
be
levied,
but
i
don't
understand
you
to
be
supporting
that
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
do
you
take
issue
with
new
york's
effort
to
estimate
the
amount
of
tax
that
will
be
required--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--based
on
estimated
sales
to
non-indians?
