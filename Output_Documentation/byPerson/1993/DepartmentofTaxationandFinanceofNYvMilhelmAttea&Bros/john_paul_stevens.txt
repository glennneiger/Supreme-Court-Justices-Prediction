justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
i
would
think
under
you
theory
you
would
have
been
entitled
to
one.
under
your
theory,
if
it's
regulated...
as
i
understand
it,
you
don't
contend
there's
any
conflict
between
any
federal
regulation
under
the
indian
traders
act
and
the
state
program,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
i
just
thought
you
thought
there
was
kind
of
a
field
preemption
by
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
also
specific
implementing
federal
regulations
that
are
in
conflict
with
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
this
doesn't
determine
price,
quantity,
or
kind,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
the
tax
is
part
of
the
price,
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
they
amended
the
new
york
statute
to
say,
although
we
used
to
call
it
part
of
the
price,
we
just
now
all
it
a
surcharge,
or
something
like
that.
then
would
there
be
a
conflict
with
the
federal
trade...
federal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
don't
see
that
that
case
supports
your
position
that
there's
a
conflict
between
this
regulation
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
your
argument
about
preemption,
but
the
question
i
really
was
leading
up
to
is,
why
isn't
your...
why
wasn't
your
preemption
position
totally
controlling
of
the
sale
by
an
indian
retailer
to
either
a
non-indian
or
an
indian,
because
it's
still
governed
by
the
statute,
the
federal
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand,
but
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
would
have
required
a
different
result
in
the
portion
of
the
opinion
that
the
chief
justice
read
to
you.
that's
where
i
don't
quite
follow
your
logic.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
wouldn't
your
100
percent
preemption
argument
require
that
there
be
no
regulation
of
the
retail
sales
by
the
state,
no
impact
on
that
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
another
hypothetical
about
your
position.
supposing
there
was
a
state
environmental
law.
say
you're
dealing
with
a
product
that
got
sour
in
3
days,
or
something
like
that,
and
there
was
an
environmental
law
that
required
that
the
product
be
delivered
within
3
days
of
the
purchase
agreement,
something
like
maybe
milk,
that
would
sour,
you'd
say
the
state
couldn't
impose
that
requirement
if
the
wholesaler
is
dealing
with
indian
retailers
to
sell
milk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case,
department
of
taxation
and
finance
of
new
york
against
milhelm
attea
&
brothers
et.
al.
comes
to
us
form
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
involves
the
validity
of
a
regulatory
scheme
adapted
by
new
york
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
evasion
of
taxes
imposed
on
the
sale
of
cigarets.
members
of
indian
tribes
who
purchase
cigarets
on
indian
reservations
are
exempt
from
the
tax
but
non-indians
making
purchases
on
the
reservations
are
required
to
pay
it.
the
new
york
scheme
imposes
recordkeeping
requirements
and
quotas
on
the
wholesalers
who
sell
untaxed
cigarets
to
reservation
indians.
the
legal
question
is
whether
that
program
is
in
conflict
with
federal
statutes
that
govern
trade
with
the
indians.
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
program
invalid
but
for
reasons
there
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
come
to
a
contrary
conclusion
and
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
