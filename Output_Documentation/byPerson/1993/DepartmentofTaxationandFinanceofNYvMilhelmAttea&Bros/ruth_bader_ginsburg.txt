but
why
isn't
the
estimation
of
the
quantity
in
advance...
why
isn't
that
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
that
says
it's
the
federal
authority
and
not
the
state
that
is
to
specify
the
kind
and
quality
of
goods?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
was
trying
to
determine
how
that
refund
worked,
both
as
a
matter
of...
would
there
be
interest
on
the
prepayment,
if
there's
a
refund,
and
how
long
is
the
process
to
get
a
refund?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
if
it's
a
prolonged
process
and
there's
no
interest,
then
you
are
also
making
an
interest-free
loan
to
the
state
of
new
york,
are
you
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
think
the
wholesaler
can
raise
the
interest
of
a
third
party
in
not
having
this
rationing
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
it's
only
congress
that
can
provide
the
cure,
that
the
commissioner
could
not
say,
well,
this
is
a
pretty
good
scheme
that
new
york
has,
so
i'm
going
to
adopt
a
regulation
that
says
all
states
can
do
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
answer
the
problem
of
the
15
packs
a
day
for
every
woman,
man,
and
child
on
the
reservation?
i
mean,
there's
obviously
grand
scale
evasion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
the
state
is
helpless
until
either
the
commissioner
or
congress
comes
to
the
rescue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
you
just...
did
i
hear
you
right,
you
can
require
the
wholesaler
with
respect
to
sales
to
indians,
did
you
say,
or
did
you
mean
non-indians?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
collection,
remittance,
and
what
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
are
you
going
to
determine
what
the
prepayment
should
be?
you
said
prepayment
is
valid.
what
are
they
going
to
pay,
on
what
quantity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--first
explain
to
me
what...
you
say
prepayment
by
the
wholesaler
is
all
right.
what
does
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wholesaler
tie
that
prepayment
to?
how
does
it
know
how
many
stamps
it
has
to
buy
per
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
be
a
little
clearer
on
exactly
what
new
york
could
legitimately
do
in
the
way
of
saying,
wholesaler,
you
prepay.
now,
you
prepay,
how
is
it
determined
how
much
you
prepay?
