we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-377,
department
of
taxation
and
finance
of
new
york
v.
milhelm
attea
brothers.
general
koppell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
we
uphold
some
sort
of
procedure
like
that
in
either
moe
or
colville,
and
wasn't
that
done
at
the
retail
level?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
koppell.
mr.
zdarsky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
couldn't
you
regulate
them
with
the
same
degree
of...
considering
the
indian
trading
act,
if
both
are
subject
to
the
indian
trading
act?
you're
suggesting
that
wholesalers
can
be
less
burdened
by
the
state
than
retailers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
federal
law
didn't
provide
for
addition
of
state
taxes
at
the
time
the
indian
retailers
sold
to
nontribal
members.
we
nonetheless
said
it
could
be
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
not
why
we
said...
we
didn't
even
mention
the
indian
trader
law
in
moe
i
don't
think,
did
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zdarsky,
in
moe
we
took
up
the
warren
trading
post
argument
and
there
was
argued
there
that
it
was
contrary
to
warren
trading
post
to
allow
the
exaction
of
the
sales
tax
on
indian
retailer
sales
to
non-indians,
and
we
said,
unlike
the
sales
tax
in
moe,
the
tax
in
warren
was
imposed
directly
on
the
seller,
and
here
to
extend
that
principle
to
the...
the
way
you're
talking
about,
we
refused
to
do
it
in
moe.
we
expressly
refused
to
do
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zdarsky.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
brinkmann,
a
fair
amount
of
your
brief
here
was
devoted
to
the
effect
of
the
new
york
regulations
on
indian
retailers,
and
yet
as
i
read
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion,
there
weren't
any
indian
retailers
involved.
they
weren't
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
didn't
base
any
of
its
reasoning
on
the
fact
that
there
were
retailers
involved.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
fact
there
were
no
retailers
who
were
parties
to
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
one
has
to
decide
it
only
in
terms
of
the
wholesalers'
claims,
and
perhaps
wholesalers
can
claim
that
they
are
protected
by
the
indian
trader
statutes
in
their
dealing
with
retailers,
but
you
agree
there
are
no
retailers
parties
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
your
time
has
expired--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--ms.
brinkmann.
general
koppell,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
koppell.
the
case
is
submitted.
