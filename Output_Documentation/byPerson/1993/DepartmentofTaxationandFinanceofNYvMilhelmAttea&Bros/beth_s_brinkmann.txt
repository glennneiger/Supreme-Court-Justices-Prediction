ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
submit
that
the
new
york
tax
regulations
are
invalid
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
they're
preempted
by
federal
indian
trader
statutes
which
occupy
the
field;
second,
the
state
regulations
are
preempted
because
they
conflict
with
the
indian
trader
statutes
in
the
implementing
regulations;
and
third,
the
state
regulations
are
invalid
under
the
court's
reasoning
in
moe
and
colville.
although
we
believe
that
pursuant
to
those
cases
the
state
can
require
wholesalers
to
collect
and
remit
state
taxes
on
valid
sales
to
indians
and
maintain
sales
records,
we
believe
that
the
new
york
regulations
go
far
beyond
the
requirements
that
were
upheld
in
those
cases.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
believe
under
the
reasoning
of
moe
and
colville
the
state
can
impose
on
the
wholesaler
simple
collection
and
remittance
requirements
and
record-keeping
requirement
on
their
sales
that
are
going
through
indian
retailers
to
non-indian.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
of
the
tax
and
record-keeping,
which
this
court
upheld
in
colville.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
think
that's
similar
to
the
question
that
was
just
asked
of
me
also
about
the
question
of
what's
before
the
court.
we
believe
that,
as
this
court
in
earlier
cases...
for
example,
potawatomi
and
elsewhere...
has
recognized
that
the
indian
trader
statutes
go
to
regulating
trade,
commerce...
there
are
two
ends
to
those
transactions,
and
in
assessing
the
burdens
on
that
commerce
or
trade,
it's
necessary
to
look
at
both
ends.
also,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
look
to
some
of
the
burdens
on
retailers.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
are
no
retailers
parties,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
recognized
the
inherent
connection
between
the
two
ends
of
commerce
and
trade.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
for
example,
the
burden
that
retailers
register
with
the
state,
that
necessarily
is
a
burden
on
the
wholesalers.
it
eliminates
their
customers
if
the
retailers
don't
register,
so
that's
the
most
blatant
burden
there
can
be
on
wholesalers.
they'll
have
no
one
to
trade
with.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
disagree,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
under
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
moe
and
colville,
that
because
there
is
a
validly
taxed
transaction
on
non-indians,
that
there
can
be
a
minimal
burden
of
collection
on
the
retailer,
that
that
same
minimal
burden
can
be
passed
through
to
the
wholesaler
under
the
court's
reasoning,
they
determined
that
that
wasn't
a
transaction
protected
by
the
indian
trader
statutes,
and
absent
some
showing
that
it
wasn't
necessary,
that
that
was
permitted
so
that
the
state
could
recoup
a
valid
tax.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
under
the
court's
reasoning
in
moe
and
colville
it
could
be,
unless,
of
course,
the
indian
traders
could
show
that
it's
more
than
a
minimum
burden,
it's
unduly
burdensome,
or
that
it's
not
necessary
to
avoid--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
believe
that
the
court's
analysis
in
its
early
opinions
in
which
it
permitted
the
retailers
to
be
required
to
collect
the
tax,
from
that
it
flows
that
that
can
be
passed
on
to
the
wholesaler.
in
moe,
in
fact,
that
was
the
underlying
factual
situation.
the
retailer
would--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
under
colville,
in
fact,
the
factual
situation
was
that
the
retailers
had
to
prepurchase
tax
stamps
from
the
state,
and
then
they
put
it
on
the
pack
at
the
time
of
the
retail
sale.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
statutory...
the
regulatory
scheme
set
up
here
imposing
a
system
of
coupons
and
quotas
and
trade
territories
is
a
comprehensive
regulation
scheme
that's
clearly
preempted
by
the
plain
language
of
the
indian
trader
statutes
and
also
conflicts
with
those
statutes
and
the
regulations,
and
we
should--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
the
difference
between
a
mere
collection
of
a
tax
that
as
the
court
in
its
earlier
cases
found
was
necessary
because
of
a
validly
imposed
tax
and
a
regulatory
scheme
that
in
truth--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
we
believe
there
are
several
avenues
which
the
state
can
pursue,
and
i
think
one
of
the
issues
that
we
differ
is
the
premise
of
the
wholesale
evasion.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--as
well
as
the
retailer.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
for
example,
in
colville,
the
court
upheld
the
record-keeping
requirement
on
the
retailers
for
both
sales
to
indians
and
non-indians.
that
simple
requirement
can
also
be
imposed
on
the
retailer
and
wholesaler
to
have
a
knowledge
of
where
the
cigarettes
that
are
being
sold
are
ultimately
being
sold
to.
that
record-keeping
would
inform
the
wholesaler
which
of
the
retailer's
cigarettes
are
being...
the
quantity
which
is
being
sold
to
non-indians
or
indians.
that's
already
a
requirement
that
this
court
has
upheld,
and
imposing
that
type
of
system
which...
new
york
has
just
jumped
over
that,
and
has
gone
to
this
wholesale
regulatory
scheme.
stepping
back,
if
the
state--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--once
the
court
makes
clear
that
these
taxes
are
applicable
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
the
retailers
and
wholesalers,
there's
no
reason
to
expect
that
there
would
be
this
type
of
wholesale
evasion
that's
alleged
here.
right
now,
it's
based
on
good
faith
belief
that
these
are
invalid
taxes.
as
happened
after
the
court's
declaration
of
the
law
in
potawatomi,
the
state
and
the
tribe
went
back
and
entered
into
a
compact.
here,
the
state
could
enter
into
a
compact
with
the
tribes--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
under
colville
we
believe
that
they
would
be
required
to
provide
that
record-keeping.
the
court
has
clearly
said
that
the
tribe
has
to
provide
the
record-keeping
to
the
state
for
their
sales
of
both
indians
and
non-indians
under
that
analysis.
also,
we
believe
that
the
state
certainly,
as
mr.
zdarsky
pointed
out,
the
court
has
numerous
times
suggested
that
they
can
go
to
congress
if
there
is
evidence
of
a
real
tax
collection
problem
after
the
law
has
been
made
clear.
also,
i
think
as
justice
ginsburg
mentioned,
there
certainly
are
avenues--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--through
the
department
of
the
interior
if
there
are
regulations--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that
record-keeping
obligation
can
be
also
imposed
on
the
wholesaler.
that's
where
we
differ
from
mr.
zdarsky.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
what
we
don't
agree
with
is--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--thank
you,
your
honor.
