as
you
read
the
decision
below--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
new
york
told
wholesalers
that
it
had
to
sell...
that
it
could
never
sell
any
untaxed
cigarettes--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that
there
were
then
some
provisions
for
refunds
of
taxes
paid
by
indian
consumers,
would
that
statute
pass
muster
under
this
court's...
this
lower
court's
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
have
a
precise
hypothetical
for
you,
but
if
the
state
were
attempting
to
impose
this
sort
of
regulation
on
some
other
state,
like
baldwin
v.
seilig,
we
would
have
a
metaphysical
problem
because
you
would
be
regulating
an
interstate
transaction,
and
that's
beyond
your
authority.
in
our
cases,
do
we
ever
make
parallels
between
indian
state
relations
and
the
interstate
commerce
jurisprudence
that
we
have?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
why
i
had
suggested
that
if
the
wholesalers
just
couldn't
sell
any
nontaxed
cigarettes
at
all,
that
ultimately
may
be
more
intrusive,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
confines
you
to
your
proper
jurisdiction
without
your
running
up
against
the
federal
statute,
which
is
its
exclusive
area.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
submission
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--my
submission
is
it
may
be
less
burdensome,
but
the
hypothetical
i
put
still
confines
you
to
your
appropriate
area
of
regulation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
assessing
the
burdens
that
are
placed
on
the
wholesalers
in
connection
with
that
sale,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
look
only
at
the
burden
on
the
wholesaler,
not
any
subsequent
downstream
burden
imposed
on
the
subsequent
indian
retail
sale.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it
were
not
a
contingent
obligation.
suppose
you
simply
had
to
sell
taxed
cigarettes
in
all
cases,
and
then
the
indian
retailer
could
use
some
refund
mechanism
which
is
not
your
concern?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be...
as
a
practical
matter,
would
it
be
a
greater
burden
on
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
effect
you're
saying
that
the
wholesalers
have
standing
to
raise
the
burdens
that
are
imposed
on
the
retailer.
