mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
of
enormous
importance
to
the
state
of
new
york,
indeed,
to
other
states,
and
also
to
people
in
private
business.
i
urge
this
court
to
reverse
our
own
court
of
appeals
which
found
our
system
for
taxing
cigarette
sales
by
indian
traders
to
non-indians
preempted
by
federal
law.
it
is
indeed
somewhat
ironic
that
i
must
ask
this
court
to
protect
our
state's
fisc
by
reversing
the
determination
of
our
court
of
appeals.
however,
this
court's
prior
decision
in
moe,
colville,
and
potawatomi,
sustained
the
state
system
as
consistent
with
federal
law,
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
not
so.
indeed,
when
this
court
remanded
this
very
case
to
our
state
courts
2
years
ago,
i
believe
that
it
did
so
because
you
recognized
that
states
may
require
both
retail
and
wholesale
indian
traders
to
assist
in
collecting
taxes
due
on
sales
to
non-indians
at
reservation
stores.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
your
honor,
the
case
before
us
narrowly
focuses
on
the
regulation
of
wholesalers,
and
not
retailers,
and
what
we
are
looking
here
is
merely
those
aspects
of
the
regulation
that
regulate
the
sale,
or
sales
by
wholesalers.
in
my
opinion,
those
are
very
narrow,
they
are
very
limited,
and
the
court
should
look
at
the
regulatory
scheme
only
as
it
affects
the
respondents
here,
who
are
cigarette
wholesalers.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
yes,
i
think
it's
severable.
i
think
the
court
could
indeed
uphold
even
portions
of
the
regulations
on
wholesalers
and
not
others,
and
certainly
this
court
should
only
deal
with
wholesalers.
the
solicitor
general
brings
into
his
brief
before
this
court
the
way
the
regulations
affect
the
retailers.
that's
really
not
before
this
court.
it
was
not
briefed
below.
there's
really
no
evidence
in
the
record
with
respect
to
how
the
regulations
affect
retailers.
with
respect
to
wholesalers,
again,
i
think
this
court
could
sever
and
find
some
of
the
regulations
applicable,
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
the
regulations
on
the
cigarette
wholesalers
are
quite
limited,
and
really
only
require
a
limited
amount
of
record-keeping
and
in
fact
are
quite
consistent
with
the
regulation
of
indian
traders
that
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
moe
case
and
in
the
colville.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
of
the
wholesalers?
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
the
wholesalers
only
have
to
be
licensed
with
respect
to
sales
to
non-indians.
if
there
were
a
wholesaler...
and
in
fact
elias
attea,
who
is
one
of
the
respondents
here,
sells
only
on
indian
reservations.
if
he
contended
that
he
wanted
to
sell
only
to
indians,
and
not
to
non-indians,
and
that
he
would
only
meet
indian
demand
on
the
reservation,
he
would
not
have
to
be
licensed.
however,
we
believe
that
virtually
all
indian
stores
sell
both
to
indians
and
to
non-indians.
to
the
extent
that
cigarettes
go
from
the
wholesalers
to
non-indians,
they
would
have
to
be
licensed,
as
are
all
wholesalers
in
the
state
of
new
york
who
sell
cigarettes
that
are
not
tax-exempt.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
no--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--that
is
not
so,
your
honor.
they
would
have
to
register
under
the
system
that
the
state
established--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--not
license,
and
specifically
in
the
regulations,
your
honor,
it
states
there
is
no
fee.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
it's
basically
a
re--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--it's
not
like
licensing.
when
you
get
licensed
you
have
to
pay
a
fee.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
yes.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
well,
the...
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
question
of
registration
is
really
not
before
this
court,
shouldn't
be
before
this
court.
the
solicitor
general--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--no,
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
you
can
decide...
you
can
decide
the...
you
can
decide
that
issue.
you
can
decide
whether
it
is
in
fact
permissible
to
limit
the
quantity
of
nontaxable
cigarettes.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
no,
i
think
there
is
more
for
you
to
decide.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
i
think
you
also
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
the
record-keeping
requirements
can
be
imposed
on
the
wholesalers,
the
limited
record-keeping
requirements.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
as
i
indicated
before,
if
i
may,
the
court
of
appeals
makes
two
basic
mistakes
in
its
reading
of
this
court's
teachings
in
the
moe
and
colville
and
potawatomi
cases,
two
basic
flaws
which
are
fundamental
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
is
before
your
honors.
if
you
look
at
a12
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition,
i
will
read
from
there,
and
they
say
the
following.
they
say...
they
contend
that
inasmuch
as
the
supreme
court
approved
the
imposition
of
precollection
and
record-keeping
requirements
on
indian
retailers
in
those
cases,
the
state
can
lawfully
impose
them
on
wholesalers,
who
are
just
one
step
further
back
on
the
distribution
chain.
moe
and
colville
involved
burdens
placed
on
indian
retailers
dealing
with
non-indians
rather
than
on
wholesalers
dealing
with
indians,
a
significant
difference,
and
that
is
the
major
difference
why
they
hold
that
in
fact
the
regulations
here
are
impermissible
with
respect
to
the
respondents,
the
wholesalers,
but
there
is
no
distinction.
they
make
a
distinction
between
retailers
and
wholesalers
for
purposes
of
the
indian
traders
act,
but
if
you
go
to
the
indian
traders
act,
you
see
that
that
is
not
a
distinction
made.
now,
it
is
clear
in
colville,
for
instance,
that
in
fact
the
indian
retailers
in
that
case
were,
in
fact,
indian
traders
under
the
federal
law.
they
were
in
the
same
category
as
the
wholesalers
here.
this
distinction
the
court
of
appeals
makes
that
you
can,
in
fact,
burden
retailers
but
you
cannot
burden
wholesalers,
otherwise
you
are
preempted
by
the
federal
law,
that
distinction
is
not
found
in
the
federal
law
and
should
not
be
made.
if
you
can
regulate
the
retailers
and
have
record-keeping
requirements
for
the
retailers,
you
can
have
those
very
same
record-keeping
requirements
on
the
wholesalers.
the
distinction
they
make
is
simply
not
found
in
federal
law,
and
it
is
nowhere
found
in
the
precedents
of
this
court,
and
again,
i
would
suggest
that
the
reason
that
this
court
sent
the
case
back
to
new
york
suggesting
that
the
court
look
at
potawatomi,
is
that
this
court
recognized
that
that
distinction
between
retailers
and
wholesalers
really
makes
no
sense.
it
has
no
basis
in
federal
law.
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--yes.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
yes.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
i
think
that
a
system
that
required
precollection
of
all
taxes
and
then
refund
might
well
not
pass
muster,
but
this
is
not
the
system
here.
what
is
attempted
to
be
done
by
the
system
is
very
simple:
to
estimate
the
number
of
tax-free
cigarettes
which
are
required
on
the
reservation
and
then
allocate
those,
and
then
say
the
remainder
of
the
inventory
has
to
be
taxable,
so
that
with
respect
to
the
indian
sales,
the
sales
to
indians
on
the
reservation,
no
tax
is
precollected,
there's
no
requirement
of
precollection
of
the
tax
and
request
for
refund.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
that...
i'm...
thank...
it
is
not
the
same,
your
honor,
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
the
question,
because
that's
the
second
flaw
in
the
court
of
appeals'
argument.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
are
not
regulating
the
number
of
cigarettes.
in
no
way.
you
can
send
as
many
cigarettes...
the
wholesalers
can
send
as
many
cigarettes
as
they
want
onto
the
reservation.
the
indian
retailers
can
sell
as
many
cigarettes
as
they
want.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
with
respect
to
untaxed
cigarettes,
that
there,
no
precollection.
we
are
limiting
the
number
of
those
to
the
legitimate
demand
of
the
indians
on
the
reservation,
and
if
that
demand
changes,
the
allocation
will
be
increased
by
the
tax
department.
it's
not
a
fixed
number,
and
it's
not
created
in
a
vacuum.
first
of
all,
the
regulations
specifically
talk
about
an
agreement
between
the
tribes
and
the
state
with
respect
to
the
number
of
tax-free
cigarettes
that
will
be
required
on
the
reservation.
only
in
absence
of
such
an
agreement
does
the
state
come
in
and
make
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
tax-free
cigarettes
that
are
required
to
meet
legitimate
indian
demand,
so
that
the
system
has
integrity
and
is
flexible,
and
if
by
chance
not
enough
tax-free
cigarettes
are
brought
to
the
reservation
and
brought
to
the
reservation
retailers,
they
can,
under
our
tax
law,
specifically
apply
for
a
refund.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
your
honor,
the
details
of
that,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
a
process.
you
just
show
that
you
made
a
tax-free
sale,
and
that
you
prepaid
the
tax,
and
then
you
get
the
money
back.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
well,
if
it's
a
prolonged
process,
which
we
do
not
believe
it
would
be...
it
has
not
been
implemented
yet.
we
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
would
be
a
prolonged
process,
and
in
fact
the
tax
department
regulations
contemplate
a
very
generous
supply
of
tax-free
cigarettes
to
the
reservation.
you
see,
the
problem
now
is
not
that
there's
a
little
bit
of
evasion
going
on,
there's
a
huge
amount
of
evasion
going
on.
it's
costing
the
state
$100
million
a
year.
the
tax
department's
not
looking
to
make
sure
that
every
single
package
of
cigarettes
that's
untaxed
is
not...
that
no
package
of
cigarettes
untaxed
is
sold
to
a
non-indian,
but
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
reservation
sales
even
6
years
ago...
even
6
years
ago
was
over
30
times
the
estimated
demand
by
native
americans
on
the
reservation.
we're
talking
about
massive
evasion
costing
the
state
over
$100
million.
so
once
these
estimates
are
made,
it
is
anticipated
that
there
will
be
more
than
enough
tax-free
cigarettes
flowing
from
the
wholesalers
like
the
respondents
here
onto
the
reservation,
and
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
go
down
and
check
each
sale.
furthermore,
the
alternative
to
this
system
would
be
far
more
intrusive,
because
if
you
had
an
alternative
of
only
collecting
the
tax
from
the
indian
retailers
and
leaving
the
wholesalers
alone,
think
of
what
that
would
require.
that
would
require
going
in
and
auditing
all
of
these
retailers...
and
you
know
how
much
the
indians
resent
intrusion
by
outsiders
on
the
reservation...
coming
into
each
of
the
indian
smoke
shops,
checking
all
of
their
books
and
sales
to
see
how
many
tax-free
cigarettes
they
sold--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--yes,
it...
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
upheld
that
one
could
do
that.
i
myself
think
that
some
of
the
problems
that
you
addressed
in
the
potawatomi
case
ensued,
and
you
will
recall,
your
honor,
that
in
the
potawatomi
decision,
you
indicated
that
if
there
were
problems
collecting
from
the
retailers,
or
going
after
the
retailers,
you
suggested
you
can
well
go
after
the
wholesalers,
and
i
think
that
was
a
recognition
that
going
after
the
retailers
is
a
difficult
thing
to
do
and
is
a
very
intrusive
thing
to
do.
and
i
am
not
suggesting
here
that
in
fact
that
if
the
burden
was
placed
on
the
retailers
it
would
necessarily
violate
the
indian
traders
act.
what
i
am
suggesting,
however,
that
this
is
a
much
less
intrusive
way
of
dealing
with
this
problem...
creating
a
realistic
assessment,
or
allotment
of
tax-free
cigarettes
to
go
into
the
reservation,
then
providing
for
the
wholesalers
to
be
able
to
sell
that
inventory
without
tax
stamp.
the
remainder
of
the
inventory
that
the
wholesalers
have
would
bear
the
tax
stamps,
would
have
the
prepayment
of
taxes
attached
to
them,
and
by...
and
then
having
a
system
down
the
line
that
allows
for
the
wholesalers
to
distribute
the
tax-free
cigarettes
to
the
retailers
based
on
these
coupons
that
the
department
of
taxation
would
issue
to
the
retailers,
who
would
then
present
them
to
the
wholesalers.
we
are
looking
now
at
how
much
this
burdens
the
wholesalers.
all
they
have
to
do
is
get
sufficient
inventory
to
meet
the
tax-free
demand,
wait
for
the
retailers
to
come
to
them
with
the
coupons,
and
then
record
the
tax-free
transactions
and
the
taxable
transactions,
and
obviously
on
the
taxable
transactions
remit
the
advance
payment
of
the
tax.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
attea
brothers,
this
is
not
a
complicated
or
burdensome
system,
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
simply
wrong
when
it
suggested
that
there
were
significant
burdens
imposed
on
respondents
by
this
system,
and
again,
as
i
mentioned
when
i
answered
justice
ginsburg's
questions,
the
court
of
appeals
was
certainly
wrong
when
they
said
that
this
somehow
limits
the
number
or
quantity
of
goods
available
on
the
indian
reservations.
in
no
way
does
it
do
that.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
i
believe
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
again,
i
believe
so,
but
i
haven't
really
studied
that.
i've
looked
only
at
the
state
tax
system.
in
any
event--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--yes.
yes.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
yes,
and
there
have
been
very
serious
problems
when
new
york
has
attempted
to
collect
sales
taxes
on
reservation
sales,
and
we're
trying
to
get
at
it
without
creating,
if
you
will
a...
it
wouldn't
be
a
civil
war,
because
these
are
sovereign
nations,
but
without
creating
a
war
with
the
indian
nations,
or
with
individuals
on
the
indian
reservations,
and
that's
why
this
allocation
system,
that
allocates
a
certain
number
of
tax-free
cigarettes,
is
the
most
efficient
way
and
easiest
way
and
least
intrusive
way
of
solving
the
problem
and
still
retaining
to
the
state
the
ability
to
tax.
again,
i
say
that
there
are
tens
of
thousands
if
you
will,
maybe
hundreds
of
thousands
of
individuals,
who
are
evading
their
tax
obligation.
it
should
be
remembered,
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
colville
case
and
in
the
moe
case
particularly,
that
the
tax
obligation
is
not
on
the
wholesaler
or
the
retailer.
the
tax
obligation
is
on
the
ultimate
purchaser
or
consumer
of
the
cigarettes,
and
the
current
system
which
has
allowed
these
tax-free
cigarettes
to
flow
on
the
reservation
without
control
has
allowed
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands,
indeed,
probably
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
yorkers,
to
violate
the
law.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
12,000...
i
think
that
the
estimate
that
we
were
given
by
the
tax
department
was
that
if
the
consumption
in
1988
was
really
only
by
indians,
they
would
be
smoking
15
packs
a
day,
every
man,
woman,
and
child,
so
that
the
evasion
is
obviously
substantial.
i
think
this
court
can
take
some
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
with
the
introduction
now
of
gaming
on
the
reservations,
the
number
of
non-indians
who
will
be
coming
on
the
reservations
will
increase
exponentially,
and
we
will
only
have
a
greater
problem
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
untaxed
cigarettes
unless
we
have
some
kind
of
system
in
place
to
control
the
flow.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
the
same
problem
can
exist
with
respect
to
that,
but
the
taxes
are
much,
much
lower,
obviously.
cigarette
taxes
are
very
high,
as
was
pointed
out.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
yes,
it
would
be
the
same
situation,
and
you--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--no,
there's
no...
no,
there's
no
system,
that's
correct.
however,
gasoline--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
gasoline
is
another
area
where
the
very
same
system
is
involved,
and
the
very
same
system
has
been
enjoined
because
of
the
litigation
over
this
system,
so
it
is
really
cigarettes
and
gasoline.
first
of
all,
the
taxes
are
much
higher
there,
and
second
of
all,
as
you
correctly
point
out,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
this
precollection
requirement
for
all
of
those
taxes
which
doesn't
exist
with
respect
to
other
sales.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
you...
well,
as
you
know,
your
honor,
the
trend,
whether
fortunately
or
unfortunately,
of
taxation
on
both
cigarettes
and
gasoline
is
in
the
other
direction.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
well,
i
don't
recall,
but
i
do
know
that
there
are
severe
limitations
on
our
ability
to
actually
impact
on
the
sovereign
state
itself.
in
fact,
that
was
the
problem
in
the
potawatomi
case,
and
therefore,
if
the
sovereign
nation
gets
into
this
business,
that
would
make
it
even
more
difficult
to
assess
the
tax
on
other
than
the
wholesaler.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
statute
prevents
you
from
doing
what
we're
doing
here.
i
don't
think
that...
in
fact,
it
would
be
in
some
senses
more
violative
of
the
federal
statute,
because
it
would
require
more
burden
on
the
wholesaler
to
precollect
the
tax
on
sales
to
indians.
that's
what
we
want
to
get
away
from.
we
want
to
get
away
from
any
tax
on
the
sale
that
goes
down
to
the
indian,
so
in
my
opinion,
though
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
would
be
impermissible
to
have
total
precollection,
because
i
don't
want
to
concede
that,
but
i
think
this
system
is
less
burdensome
on
the
wholesaler--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--and
therefore--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--i
don't
quite
follow
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
the
appropriate...
we
are
permitted
to
provide
for
minimal
burdens
without
violating
the
indian
trader
act.
the
minimal
burden
here
is
not
dissimilar
to
the
burden
placed
on
retailers
which
has
been
approved
by
this
court
on
a
number
of
occasions,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
we
provided
for
the
prepayment
of
taxes
on
sales
to
indians,
and
then
required
them
to
go
for
a
refund
in
every
case,
we
would
be
doing
more
than
we're
doing
here.
we
wouldn't
be
doing
less,
we'd
be
doing
more
to
invade
an
area
that
arguably
has
been
preempted
by
the
indian
traders
act.
i
think
we're
trying
to
stay
away
from...
after
all,
the
indian
traders
act
does
not
regulate
trade
between
non-indians
and
non-indians,
or
even
indians
and
non-indians.
it
only
regulates
trade
with
indians
by
both
indians
and
non-indians,
so
that
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
to
the
extent
we
can
stay
away
from
burdening
trade
between
the
indian
trader
and
the
indians,
we
are
consistent
in
my
view
with
the
federal
law
and
not,
therefore,
preempted
from
acting,
which
is
what
is
suggested...
i
think
incorrectly
suggested
by
our
own
court
of
appeals.
in
any
event,
your
honors,
i
believe
that
the
system
here
is
consistent
with
precedent.
as
i
indicated,
i
believe
that
our
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
concluding
that
there's
any
difference
with
what...
regulations
that
can
burden
retailers
who
are
indian
traders
and
wholesalers
who
are
indian
traders,
and
i
also
believe
there
are
no
significant
burdens
placed
on
the
wholesalers
here,
and
for
the
reasons
that
i
gave.
i
also
suggest
that
the
solicitor
general's
argument
with
respect
to
the
burdens
placed
upon
the
indian
retailers,
and
suggesting
that
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed
because
those
burdens
are
excessive,
although
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
wholesalers,
i
suggest
that
this
court
really
should
not
consider
that
at
this
time.
that
may
come
before
the
court
in
the
future.
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
anything
in
the
record
to
consider.
in
a
sense,
it's
the
same
situation
that
we
had
with
respect
to
this
matter
in
colville,
where
the
indians
didn't
put
in
the
record
any
evidence
with
respect
to
the
burden
upon
them
by
these
regulations,
and
therefore
the
court
felt
that
since
it
was
on
the...
the
burden
was
on
the
retailers,
if
you
will,
to
put
evidence
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
burden
and
absent
such
evidence
this
court
upheld
the--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--i
don't
think
that
they
can,
and
frankly
i
don't
think
that
they
did
in
this
case,
even
if
they
could,
so
the
fact...
but
again,
even
if
we
look
at
that
system,
and
i
call
to
your
attention,
incidentally,
with
respect
to
that
a
particular
affidavit
which
is
in
the
record
on
appeal,
pages
244
to
246,
which
describes
the
system
as
respects
the
retailers,
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
impermissible
or
violates
preemption,
because
i
think
it's
a
logical
system
that
allocates
the
tax-free
cigarettes
among
the
retailers,
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
they
don't
have
to
be
licensed,
they
merely
have
to
register,
and
so
again,
your
honors,
i
urge
you
to
reverse
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
sustain
the
system,
and
i
would
request
that
i
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
to
be
very
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
central
machinery
and
warren
trading
post
cases
relied
on
by
respondents
specifically
related
to
taxes
on
sellers,
in
the
case
of
central
machinery
of
farm
machinery,
to
indian
tribes
and
indians
on
the
reservation.
the
warren
case
dealt
with
tax,
state
tax
on
gross
income
of
a
corporation
selling
goods
at
retail
to
indians
on
an
indian
reservation.
that's
completely
different,
and
not
related
to
what's
happening
here,
and
what
illustrates
that
best,
mr.
chief
justice
is...
and
i
quote
from
the
moe
decision...
"the
state's
requirement
that
an
indian
tribal
seller
collect
a
tax
validly
imposed
on
non-indians
is
a
minimal
burden
designed
to
avoid
the
likelihood
that
in
its
absence
non-indians
purchasing
from
the
tribal
seller
will
avoid
payment
of
a
concededly
lawful
tax,
since
this
burden
is
not,
strictly
speaking,
a
tax
at
all.
"
the
argument
that
we
are
here
taxing
the
indian
trader
is
simply
not
so,
and
it's...
the
warren
case
and
the
central
michigan
case
are
completely
different.
the
tax
also
is
not...
it's
not
part
of
the
price.
if
you
look
in
the
appendix
at
page
a46
you'll
see
that
the
tax
has
to
be
added
to
the
price,
but
it's
not
part
of
the
price
and
we're
therefore
not
affecting
the
price
of
goods,
which
is
the
province
of
the
federal
government.
we
are
simply
having
the
tax
added
to
the
price
on
the
non-indian
purchaser,
which
is
concededly
valid
under
the
moe
decision
and
the
colville
decisions.
furthermore,
if
the
non-indian...
if
there
was
a
non-indian
who
was
in
fact
on
the
reservation
and
sold
to
indians,
i
believe
that
that
transaction
would
not
be
any
different
from
a
transaction
between
the
indian
trader
wholesaler
and
the
indian
retailers,
in
answer,
i
believe
it
was
to
your
question,
judge...
justice
scalia.
so
as
i
indicated
before,
the
issue
here
is
very
narrow.
it's--
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
--yes.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
who
is
doing
business
on
the
reservation,
that's
correct.
he
would
be
covered
by
the
indian
trader
law.
there
is
no
distinction...
this
is
the
key.
there's
no
distinction
in
federal
law
between
a
retail
indian
trader
and
a
wholesale
indian
trader,
and
the
very
same
burdens
as
have
been
approved
in
colville
and
moe
and
by
indirection
in
potawatomi
are
placed
upon
the
wholesalers
here
and
should
be
upheld.
mr.
g.
oliver
koppell
no.
i
derive
that
from
a
reading
of
the
indian
trader
statutes,
and
what
in
fact
constitutes
an
indian
trader.
those
are
also
in
the
appendix.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
what
we
are
doing
here
is
not
at
all
dissimilar
from
what
was
done
and
approved
in
colville
and
moe.
thank
you,
your
honor.
