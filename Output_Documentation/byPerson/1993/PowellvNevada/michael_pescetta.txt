mr.
michael
pescetta
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes,
very
accurate,
your
honor,
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
is
a
very
narrow
one,
and
i
submit
it
becomes
even
narrower
in
light
of
the
questions
that
are
not
contested
by
respondent
or
any
party
in
this
case.
and
i'd
like
to
begin,
if
i
may,
by
emphasizing
what
is
not
an
issue,
as
we
understand
it.
first,
no
one
before
the
court,
as
i
understand
it,
is
asking
this
court
to
reconsider
griffith
v.
kentucky,
and
therefore
i
would
submit
that
it
is
conceded
before
this
court
that
any
federal
constitutional
decision
which
is
currently
in
effect
must
be
applied
to
any
decision
on
the
merits
of
mr.
powell's
case,
since
his
case
is
not
yet
final
on
direct
appeal.
i
submit
it
is
further
not
contested
before
this
court
that
there
was
a
presumptive
mclaughlin
violation
in
this
case,
because
the
48...
the
petitioner
did
not
receive
a
judicial
determination
of
probable
cause
within
the
48-hour
time
limit
in
which
that
is
presumptively
reasonable
under
mclaughlin.
and
so
third
i
would
submit
it
is
not
contested
that
under
mclaughlin
if
it
is
applied
pursuant
to
griffith
v.
kentucky,
the
nevada
supreme
court
erred
in
failing
to
give
mr.
powell
the
benefit
of
that
decision.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
submit
that
we
possibly
could
have
raised
it
in
the
context
of
an
ineffective
assistance
claim,
imposed
conviction,
though
that's
not
entirely
clear.
mr.
michael
pescetta
exactly,
your
honor,
i
agree.
we
acknowledge
it
was
not
raised.
the
nevada
supreme
court,
which
does
so
periodically,
reached
out
sua
sponte
and
drew
this
issue
out
of
the
case,
and
it
decided
it
correctly
with
respect
to
the
substance
but
incorrectly
with
respect
to
its
retroactive
effect.
mr.
michael
pescetta
that
would
be
a
terribly
result-oriented
result
in
the
case,
your
honor,
but
i
submit
that
until
the
nevada
supreme
court
decides
to
do
that,
that
question
is
premature
at
this
point.
we
might
conceivably
raise
a
law
of
the
case
argument
in
the
nevada
supreme
court
since
there
is
a
very
strong
law
of
the
case
doctrine
in
nevada.
if
the
nevada
supreme
court
found
some
way
to
wriggle
off
the
mclaughlin
hook,
i
think
that's
a
situation
we
would...
we
should
address
if
it,
in
fact,
does
so.
but
they
certainly
have
the
power,
and
that
has
not
been
contested
by
any
party
to
this
case,
to
reach
out
and
decide
this
federal
constitutional
question.
and
having
done
so,
under
cohen
v.
cowles
media
and
all
of
this
court's
precedents
having
reached
the
issue
on
the
merits,
the
jurisdiction
is
properly
in
this
court.
i
submit
it's
for
another
day
if
the
nevada
supreme
court...
as
are
many
of
these
issues
in
this
case,
are
for
consideration
another
day
if
the
nevada
supreme
court
acts
on
remand
in
a
manner
that
denies
petitioner
relief.
mr.
michael
pescetta
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
a
federal
exclusionary
remedy
for
a
mclaughlin
violation
is
unnecessary
to
the
disposition
of
this
case
because
nevada
has
its
own
state
law
remedy,
essentially
a
state
law
mcnabb-mallory
rule,
which
on
remand,
once
it
is...
once
it
is
required
to
properly
apply
mclaughlin
to
this
case,
will
kick
in.
and
that's
why
we've
cited
a
number
of--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--we
submit
that
it
would
have
to
be
excluded
under
federal
and
state
law,
because
we
submit
on
the
merits
that
there
should
be
a
federal
exclusionary
remedy.
we
submit
that
that
issue
also
is
not
necessary
to
the
disposition
of
the
case
because
of
the
existence
of
a
state
law
remedy
for
that
violation.
that's
why
we
have
cited
welsh
v.
wisconsin
and
other
cases
in
our
reply
brief
in
which
very
similar
situations
have
arisen
in
which
a
federal
constitutional
violation
implicates
a
state
law
remedy
in
which
this
court
has
not
proceeded
to
the
federal
exclusionary
remedy
that
would
be
required,
if
any,
but
remands
for
consideration
under
the
state
law
remedy.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
the
terms
of
the
nevada
supreme
court's
opinion--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--but,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
this
court
should
pretermit
that
analysis
by
the
nevada
supreme
court.
i
would
submit
that
once
this
court
is
properly
invested
with
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
question,
which
it
is,
this
court's
responsibility
is
to
decide
the
federal
question.
mr.
michael
pescetta
your
honor,
what
i
was
suggesting
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
was
that
since
there
is
a
state
law
remedy
available
for
the
federal
law
violation,
that
this
court
need
not
proceed
to
delineate
the
scope
of
the
federal
exclusionary
remedy.
i
submit
that...
what
i
believed
justice
souter's
question
was
was
that
if
this
is
remanded
and
if
the
nevada
supreme
court
decides
the
mclaughlin
issue
on
the
merits,
as
i
believe
it
must,
the
availability
of
the
state
law
remedy
will
result
in
reversal.
that's
our
position.
now
if
their...
if
the
nevada
supreme...
i
would
agree
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
could
do
any
number
of
things.
it
could
reverse
on
remand
on
an
entirely
different
ground
and
never
reach
this
issue.
but
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
having
reached
this
issue,
they
decided
it
correctly.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i'm
not
saying
that
you
can't,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
under
this
court's
consistent
practice
you
shouldn't,
because
it's
unnecessary
to
the
disposition
of
the
case.
i'd
just
like
to
remind
the
court
that
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
all
we
asked
for
was
for
this
judgment
to
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
proper
consideration
in
light
of
griffith.
so
although
you
have
given
us
this
hour,
your
honor,
that
is
actually
more
than
we
asked
for.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
don't
believe
there
is
such
a
rule.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
terms
of
the
nevada
supreme
court
opinion
which
accept
the
prejudicial
effect
of
the
statement
that
was
elicited
from
the
defendant
as
a
result
of
this
delay
in
the
probable
cause
determination
will
govern
their
disposition
of
this
issue.
i
submit
that
if
this
court
reverses
and
remands
for
further
proceedings
in
the
nevada
supreme
court,
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
will
properly
apply
its
state
law
remedy
which
it
has
traditionally
adhered
to,
and
it
will
reverse
this
case.
and
i
don't...
you
know,
although
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
stand
up
for
the
nevada
supreme
court,
until
they
do
something
that
is
unfair
to
us
in
that
regard,
i
submit--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
disagree
your
honor,
first
because
under
this
court's
consistent
jurisprudence,
most
recently
ylst
v.
nunnemaker,
a
federal
law
claim
can
be
forfeited
all
the
way
through
a
state
system,
and
if
it
is
revived
by
being
considered
on
the
merits
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
it's
revived.
jurisdiction
of
this
court
attaches
and
the
decision
of
the
federal
question
by
the
state
court
is
subject
to
review.
on
the
question
of
whether
this
was
dealt
with
en
passant,
i'd
like
to
get
to
what
i
think
is
the
thrust
of
respondent's
contention
and
really
respondent's
only
contention,
which
is
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
did
not,
in
fact,
decide
the
fourth
amendment
question.
mr.
michael
pescetta
without
being
overly
disingenuous
about
it,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
ever
since
ashwander
this
court
has
not
decided
federal
constitutional
questions
just
in
case.
it
has
consistently
adhered
to
the
practice
that
if
there
is
a
state
law
remedy
or
if
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
question
which
is
presented
but
which
is
not
necessary
to
the
decision,
that
it
will
not
reach
that
question.
now,
we
are
fairly
confident,
perhaps
overly
confident,
that
our
analysis
of
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
is
accurate
and
that
there
should
be
a
federal
exclusionary
remedy
consistent
with
justice
blackmun's
opinion
in
brown
v.
illinois.
but
i
think
that
what
i
have
to
focus
on
before
this
court
is
obtaining
relief
for
my
client,
and
as
i
see
it,
remanding
this
case
to
the
nevada
supreme
court
will
result
in
that
relief.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
submit
that--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
is
correctly
not
within
the
question
presented.
but
i
additionally
submit
that
that
is
also
a
question
of
state
law
which
this
court
need
not
reach.
and
their
decision,
the
nevada
supreme
court's
decision--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
agree,
your
honor.
as
i
was--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
believe
with
respect--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
submit
with
respect
to
the
arraignment
and
first
appearance
statutory
issue,
that
that
is
a
question
of
state
law.
and
if
you
look
at
page
8
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
fact
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
in
resolving
the
question
of
waiver
referred
explicitly
to
the
defendant's
waiver
of,
quote,
his
right
to
an
appearance
before
a
magistrate
within
72
hours,
which
is
the
state
law
ground,
the
state
statute
which
it
had
just
found
unconstitutional
on
mclaughlin
grounds,
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
that
waiver
point
was
decided
purely
as
a
question
of
state
law
and
does
not
impact
the
disposition
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
pescetta
my
point
exactly,
your
honor.
if,
as
the
state
urges,
that
there
has
been
a
waiver,
our
response
to
that
is
your
honor's
response
to
that;
there
has
been
no
waiver
of
the
federal
constitutional
right.
and
the
discussion
of
the
waiver
issue
in
the
nevada
supreme
court's
opinion
is
directed
entirely
at
the
state
statutory
right
because
having
found
the
mclaughlin
violation,
the
nevada
supreme
court
then
tripped
in
this
footnote
and
said,
but
we
are
not
going
to
apply
it
to
petitioner's
case.
and
i
would
just
like
to
repeat
for
emphasis,
we
cite--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--absolutely,
your
honor.
that
portion
of
the
opinion
deals
solely
with
the
arraignment
and
first
appearance
statute,
not
with
the
fourth
amendment
ground.
because,
as
i
think
the
court
recognizes,
the
nevada
supreme
court,
having
found
the
fourth
amendment
violation,
then
did
not
apply
that
rule
to
petitioner's
case
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
before
it
on
direct
appeal.
now--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--yes,
your
honor.
i
agree
that
there
are
shards
sticking
up
in
various
places
on
different
issues,
but
what
they
get
to
and
what
i
submit
renders
the
respondent's
argument
completely
indefensible
is
the
language
that
appears
on
page
6
of
the
joint
appendix
when
they
finally
get
to
the
mclaughlin
issue
and
they
say,
quote,
the
mclaughlin
case
renders
nrs
171.1783
unconstitutional.
based
on
mclaughlin
we
hold...
we
hold
that
a
suspect
must
come
before
a
magistrate
within
48
hours,
including
nonjudicial
days,
for
a
probable
cause
determination.
now,
we've
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
our
brief
on
independent
and
adequate
state
grounds,
and
i
submit
that
this
language
puts
the
state's
position
completely
out
of
court.
when
a
lower
court
says
we
hold
that
a
federal
constitutional
decision
renders
our
practice
unconstitutional,
i
submit
that
it
really
couldn't
be
clearer.
and
it
is
immediately
after
that
paragraph
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
goes
in
a
footnote
to
the
retroactivity
analysis.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
agree.
but
the
previous
portion
of
its
opinion
in
which
it
cited
the
huebner
line
of
state
cases,
are
the
cases
that
adopt
the
mcnabb...
state
mcnabb-mallory
rule.
so
it's
our
position
that
having
found...
having
gone
through
that
analysis,
having
analyzed
the
question
in
terms
of
the
inadmissability
of
a
statement
obtained
in
part
on
the
basis
of
illegal
prolongation
of
detention,
that--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
don't
think
it
is
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
think--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
we
cited
the
huebner
v....
huebner
v.
state,
morgan
v.
sheriff,
berman
v.
sheriff.
all
of
these
cases
are
actually
cited
in
the
nevada
supreme
court
opinion
at
joint
appendix
5.
mr.
michael
pescetta
that
there
is
a
state
mcnabb-mallory
rule
that
results
in
the--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--well,
that
inadmissability
of
a
statement
arises
from
an
illegal
prolongation
of
detention.
mr.
michael
pescetta
they
have
not...
they
have
not
distinguished
between
constitutional
violation,
state
law
violations
in
those
cases.
delay
is
delay,
as
i
see
it.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
submit
that
the
terms
of
those
previous
decisions
do
indicate
that
a
delay,
which
is
concededly...
concededly
does
not
invoke
a
federal
exclusionary
rule
under
mcnabb-mallory
because
mcnabb-mallory
is
not
a
federal
constitutional
rule,
nonetheless
results
in
inadmissability.
and
it's
our
position
that
that
line
of
cases
does
not
discriminate
amongst
state
law
violations,
federal
law
violations,
and
prolongation
of
detention.
now,
to
turn
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
federal
exclusionary
rule,
i
submit
that
this
is
purely
a
rule
that
would
follow
all
of
the
principles
enunciated
by
numerous
decisions
in
this
court,
that
the
purpose
of
an
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
the
wrongful
conduct.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
police
within
this
48-hour
presumptive
period,
or
at
any
period
without
unnecessary
delay,
to
cause
the
probable
cause
determination
to
be
made.
they
didn't.
instead
they
elicited
a
statement.
now
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
is--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--the
nevada
supreme
court
implicitly
found
it
did.
the
record
does
not
show
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
michael
pescetta
implicitly,
they
made
a
finding--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--implicitly,
yes.
mr.
michael
pescetta
the
nevada
supreme
court's
opinion
says
there
are...
there
is
prejudice
from
the
admissability--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
these
statements...
the
statement
was
elicited
the
same
day
as
the...
as
the
probable
cause
determination.
we've
conceded
that,
certainly,
before
this
court.
there
is
nothing,
however,
in
the
record
upon
which
this
court
can
say
the
nevada
supreme
court
was
clearly
erroneous
in
that
regard.
it
simply
doesn't
show
it
and
that's,
i
take
it,
largely
because
it
wasn't
litigated
below.
mr.
michael
pescetta
no.
mr.
michael
pescetta
because
they
refer
to
the
eliciting
of
the
statements
as
being
prejudicial
in
their
discussion
of
the
huebner
rule,
which
is
key
to--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--a
finding
is
a
finding,
your
honor.
i'm
afraid--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--well,
i
submit
that
this
is
entitled
under
sumner
v.
madda
and
previous
cases
to
the
same
respect
that
any
state
court
finding
is.
now,
granted
because
of
the
posture
in
which
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
record
is
not
pellucid
on
many
issues.
that
is
why
we
submit
that
this
case
has
to
go
back
to
the
nevada
supreme
court.
in
fact,
many
of
the
respondent's
arguments,
including
complaining
about
the
inability
to
show
attenuation
or
necessary
delay,
are
in
fact
grounds
for
reversing
this
judgment
and
not
for
affirming
it.
and
so
although
technically
the
state
can't
urge
those
grounds
because
no
cross
petition
was
filed,
we
submit
that
essentially
they
have
conceded
that
there
have
to
be
future
proceedings
in
this
case.
now,
with
respect
to
the
deterrent--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
submit,
your
honor,
that's,
at
most,
a
mixed
question.
the
question
of
harmlessness
is
not
a
purely
factual
issue
which
the
nevada
supreme
court
can
determine.
i'd
just
like
to
say
one
more
word
about
the
deterrent
effect
of
a
federal--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--it
can
say
it
but
that,
i
submit,
is
not
a
factual
finding
to
which
this
court
must
defer.
mr.
michael
pescetta
harmlessness
is
a
federal
constitutional
issue.
mr.
michael
pescetta
well,
first
of
all,
we
don't
concede
that
they're
identical.
one
of
the
statements
is
about
7
pages
long,
the
other
is
40
pages
long,
considerably
more
detailed,
so
that
fruit
is
significantly
more
damaging
than
the
first
statement.
but
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize
that
that
issue
is
not
a
factual
finding
to
which
this
court
must
defer.
that's
a
question
of
harmlessness.
mr.
michael
pescetta
in
fact
they
should
do
that,
your
honor,
i
submit.
mr.
michael
pescetta
and
under
rule
250...
under
nevada
supreme
court
rule
250(iv)(h),
we
would
ask
for
them
to
do
that
unless
they
simply
reverse.
one
final
point
about
the
federal
exclusionary
remedy.
this
has
exactly
the
same
problems,
this
kind
of
situation
involving
mclaughlin,
as
every
other
exclusionary
situation
has.
what
we're
trying
to
deter
is
the
police
from
profiting
from
the
illegal
prolongation
of
the
delay.
this...
a
federal
exclusionary
remedy
would
be
narrowly
tailored
to
that,
to
the
harm
that
is
caused
by
that
illegal
prolongation,
and
therefore
based
on
the
argument
we've
presented
in
the
briefs
we
would
submit
that
this
court
should
adopt
a
federal
exclusionary
remedy
if
it
reaches
that
question
which,
again,
i
emphasize
it
does
not
need
to.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
will
try
to
talk
fast,
your
honor.
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
what
happens
if
the
nevada
supreme
court
says
we
are
not
going
to
decide
this
issue,
is
that
would
then
not
be
an
adequate
state
ground
for
the
decision.
we
submit
that
if
the
nevada
supreme
court
adopts
a
procedural
bar
rule
that
says
we
will
forgive
procedural
bars
so
long
as
we
don't
have
to
reverse,
but
we
will
invoke
procedural
bars
so
long
as
we
can
affirm,
that's
not
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground.
and
that
i
submit
is
the
short
answer
to
your
concern
about
what
happens
if
the
case
goes
back.
i
submit
that
the
mclaughlin
violation,
contrary
to
what
counsel
said,
means--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--then
we
have
to
litigate
the
procedural
bar
issue
in
the
nevada
supreme
court,
and
ultimately
in
this
court,
but
that's
not
ripe
for
decision
today.
mr.
michael
pescetta
because
the
adequacy
of
a
state
procedural
bar
is
always
a
question
of
federal
law,
to
bar
review
of
a
federal
constitutional
issue.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
it
reviewed
the
issue;
that's
the
end
of
the
question.
now,
as
to
good
faith,
the
state
is
relying
on
the
statute
which
it
says
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
probable
cause
determination,
the
first
appearance
statute,
to
say
they
could,
in
good
faith,
rely
on
that
in
allowing
the
72
hour
time
limit.
i
submit
that's
entirely
anomalous
to
say
on
the
one
hand
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
probable
cause
determination,
but
on
the
other
hand
that's
the
good
faith
reliance
on
the
statute
that
invokes
illinois
v.
krull.
with
respect
to
harris
and
the
illegality
of
custody,
illegal
custody
under
mclaughlin
is
illegal
custody.
he
shouldn't
be
in
custody
because
it's
illegal.
the
difference
between
harris
is
the
manner
of
arresting
him
was
the
constitutional
violation;
the
custody
was
legal.
here,
once
the
mclaughlin
time
limit
was
passed,
the
custody
became
illegal.
he
should
not
have
been
in
custody,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
at
that
point.
i
thank
the
court.
