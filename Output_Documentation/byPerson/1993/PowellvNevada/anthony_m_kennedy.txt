although
it's
not
in
the
question
presented,
do
you
think
that
it's
also
necessary,
even
under
your
minimum
suggested
approach,
that
we
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
nevada
supreme
court
was
correct
in
saying
that
a
right
to
seasonable
arraignment
is
waived
when
you
waive
your
miranda
rights?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
was
that
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you...
is
it
clear
to
you
that
it's
a
question
of
state
law--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
the
nevada
court
treated
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we'll
just
footnote
the
fact
that
i
don't
understand
how
a
state
law
waiver
controls
the
existence
of
a
federal
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
is
it
clear
that
the
statement
was
elicited
before
the
hearing
was
held,
because
the
statement
and
the
hearing
were
both
november
7?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that...
explicitly
found
that
the
statement
was
prior
to
the
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
implicitly.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case...
excuse
me.
in
this
case
was
there
a
probable
cause
determination
by
a
magistrate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when,
on
november
7
or
before?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
beyond
the
time
allowed
in
mclaughlin.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
whether
or
not
the
probable
cause
and
the
arraignment
proceeding
are
combined,
there
was
a
violation
of
mclaughlin,
assuming
mclaughlin
is
retroactive,
which
i
think
it
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
we
begin
with
the
premise
that
there's
been
a
mclaughlin
violation,
and
the
nevada
supreme
court
is
wrong
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
mclaughlin
is
retroactive,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
nevada
supreme
court
was
wrong
on
that
point,
was
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
plausible
to
read
the
nevada
supreme
court's
opinion
as
saying
that
if
there
were
a
mclaughlin
violation,
this
statement
would
have
to
be
excluded
under
the
state's
huebner
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wait,
wait.
i
didn't
hear
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
what
then
was
the
purpose
of
nevada's
discussing
mclaughlin
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
a
death
case
i
think
we
should
know,
don't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
if
we're
with
you...
even
if
we're
with
you
so
far,
was
not,
in
this
case,
there
a
combined
arraignment
and
probable
cause
hearing
on
november
7?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
a
simply
mclaughlin
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
has
the
nevada
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
the
huebner
line
of
cases
would
not
apply
to
a
violation
of
the
time
limits
for
a
probable
cause
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
was
has
nevada
said,
as
a
definitive
matter,
that
its
state
mcnabb-mallory
rule
does
not
apply
to
a
probable
cause
hearing
when
the
probable
cause
hearing
is
beyond
the
legal...
legally
set
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
mr.
estrada,
correct
me
if
you
have
a
different
interpretation.
i
had
thought
the
submission
from
the
petitioner
was
that
if
there
had
been
a
violation
of
federal
law,
if
mclaughlin
were
retroactive,
which
it
is,
that
the
state
would
have
invoked
its
own
mcnabb-type
rule
to
exclude
the
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
that
the
concern
that
i
have,
at
least,
is
that
the
state
court
ought
to
be
the
one
to
make
this
explicit
determination
in
the
first
instance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
that's
exactly...
that
the
nevada
court
would
have
denied
relief
had
it
assumed
a
federal
violation
under
mclaughlin.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
all
that
assumes
that
hawaii...
that
nevada
will
not
apply
its
huebner
rule
to
a
mclaughlin
violation,
and
we
don't
know
that
for
sure.
and
i
can
understand
the
interest
of
the
solicitor's
office
in
arguing
the
exclusionary
rule;
it's
a
very
important
issue.
but
i
cannot
understand
the
interest
of
the
solicitor's
office
in
urging
that
we
proceed
to
that
in
the
light
of
this...
in
the
light
of
this
opaque
opinion.
