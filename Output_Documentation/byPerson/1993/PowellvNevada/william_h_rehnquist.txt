chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
92-8841,
kitrich
powell
v.
nevada.
mr.
pescetta.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
an
accurate
pronunciation
of
the
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
question,
as
you
said
in
the
beginning,
mr.
pescetta,
is
narrow.
and
as
you
continue
to
discuss
it,
it's
narrow
indeed.
one
perhaps
we
would
not
ordinarily
grant...
if
it's
as
narrow
as
you
say...
an
hour's
argument
on
it.
it's
simply
whether
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
was
wrong
in
deciding
that
mclaughlin
would
not
be
given
retroactive
effect.
and
you
say
we
can't
possibly
go
any
further
than
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
we
think
we
need
the
full
hour.
[laughter]
let
me...
may
i
just
go
back
to
the
nevada
law
question?
does
nevada
have
an
announced
rule
that
when
relief
can
be
granted
as
requested
by
a
prisoner,
nevada
will
always
take
up
the
state
law
issue
first?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
read
it
as
saying
that
it
holds
our
practice
unconstitutional.
it
says
based
on
mclaughlin
we
hold
that
a
suspect
must
come
before
a
magistrate
within
48
hours,
including
for
a
probable
cause
determination.
it
doesn't
say
what
the
consequences
of
failure
to
come
before
the
magistrate
are.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we...
of
course
this
court
has
followed
a
mcnabb-mallory
type
of
rule,
and
yet
surely
it's
an
open
question
here
whether
an
exclusionary
rule
accompanies
the
violation
of
the
mclaughlin
rule.
why
wouldn't
the
nevada
court
take
the
same
position;
yes,
in
huebner
we
have
a
mcnabb-mallory
rule,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
answer
the
question
as
to
the
remedy
for
a
violation
of
the
48-hour
arraignment
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
nevada
supreme
court
say
anything
more
than
that
they
both
happened
on
the
same
day?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
how
can
you
say
they
made
an
implicit
finding
that
one
happened
before
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
surely
that
is
the
most
implicit
of
implicit
findings,
if
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
agree
that
a
finding
is
a
finding;
i
just
don't
agree
with
you
that
this
is
a
finding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
pescetta.
mr.
seaton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
in
clark
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
certainly
nothing
in
our
mclaughlin
case
that
suggests
a
defendant
would
have
to
be
personally
present
at
the
probable
cause
determination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
following...
we
just
followed
gerstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seaton.
mr.
estrada,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
just
so
much
help
one
can
get
from
this
opinion,
mr.
estrada,
and
it's
not
very
much.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
pescetta,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pescetta.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-8841,
powell
against
nevada
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
