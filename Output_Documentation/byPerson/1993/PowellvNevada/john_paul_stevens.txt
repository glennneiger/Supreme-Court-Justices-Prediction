justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
the...
in
their
footnote
they
don't
just
talk
about
inadmissability
of
the
statement.
they
seem
to
assume
in
the
footnote
that
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
72-hour
state
law
rule
or
the
48-hour
federal
rule,
that
the
prisoner
would
automatically
be
entitled
to
his
freedom
whether
he
confessed
or
not.
that's
the
way
the
footnote
reads.
they're
talking
about
untold
numbers
would
all
be
set
free.
that
can't
be
the
right
remedy,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
representing
that
that's
the
state
law
remedy
that
would
be
applied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just...
what
is
the
case
that
holds
that
there's
an
exclusionary
rule
that's
applied
as
a
matter
of
state
law
when
there's
a
violation
of
federal
law
as
to
the
period
of
detention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
proposition
for
which
you
cite
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
when
there's
a
violation
of
the
state
detention
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
illegal
because
of
the
state
requirement
of
prompt
arraignment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
to
confess
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
you're
saying
the
probable
cause
determination
is
not
made
in
the
course
of
the
first
appearance
before
the
magistrate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
supreme
court
of
nevada,
on
page
6,
says:
"based
on
mclaughlin,
we
hold
that
a
suspect
must
come
before
a
magistrate
within
48
hours,
including
nonjudicial
days,
for
a
probable
cause
determination.
"
that
reads
to
me
like
saying
they
have
to
have
the
probable
cause
determination
in
the
first
appearance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
exactly
what
that
sentence...
you'll
agree
that
sentence
says
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
what
says
something
else
in
the
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
there
in
the
opinion
that
says
something
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know...
you
told
us
there
are
two
separate
proceedings,
but
does
the
court
say
that...
elsewhere
in
its
opinion
that
the
probable
cause
determination
is
not
made
in
the
first
appearance
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
i
just
don't
understand
what
the
authority
is
for
the
proposition
that
the
probable
cause
determination
is
not
made
in
the
first
appearance
hearing,
which
seems
to
be
something
you're
arguing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
there
in
writing
that
tells
us
that
is
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
doesn't
show
that
it
is
correct
to
have...
not
to
make
the
probable
cause
determination
in
the
first
appearance
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
obviously
the
nevada
supreme
court
says
that's
what
you're
supposed
to
do
in
nevada,
according
to
this
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
just
agreed
with
me
that
that's
what
that
sentence
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
that's
what
it
says,
but
we
have
some
kind
of
secret
meaning
behind
what
the
words
are.
go
back...
you
were
telling
us
what
happens
in
this
county
in
nevada.
i
think
you
started
out
that
way.
are
these
still
separate
proceedings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about
your
first...
your
first
appearance
hearing,
is
that
always
an
arraignment
where
the
defendant
pleads
not
guilty
or
guilty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case
it
was
an
arraignment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
november
13th
hearing
was
an
arraignment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
is
it
not
conceivable
that
the
probable
cause
determination
could
take
place
at
the
earlier
date,
with
the
defendant
present
or
not
present,
yet
still
have
the
arraignment
at
a
later
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
so
that...
i
mean
it
could
be
the
first
appearance
would
have
been
at
the
time
of
the
probable
cause
determination,
rather
than
the
arraignment
is
what
i'm
asking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
they
are
not
necessarily
an
arraignment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
is
it
possible
as
a
matter
of
nevada
law
that
on
november
7th
the
magistrate
made
a
probable
cause
determination
at
which
the
defendant
was
present.
or
maybe
he
wasn't,
but
as
a
matter
of
routine
he
could
have
been
present,
even
though
he
was
not
yet
ready
for
arraignment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
could
not
happen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
nevada
supreme
court
has
said
in
its
opinion,
that's
what
must
happen
in
the
future,
that
he
must...
the
defendant
must
be
present
at
the
probable
cause
determination
in
less
than
48
hours,
even
though
he
doesn't
have
to
be
arraigned
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
estrada,
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
but
i...
maybe
i'm
not
following
you,
but
you're
saying
that
the
court
said
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
you
mean
the
mclaughlin
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
say
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
48-hour
requirement
mandated
in
mclaughlin
does
not
apply
to
the
case
at
hand.
that
seems
to
me
to
say
it
was
not
violated
because
it
simply
didn't
apply,
because
they
mistakenly
thought
it
was
not
retroactive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
they
find
a
violation
of
a
rule
that
doesn't
even
apply
to
the
case
at
hand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
say
that
in...
i
mean,
i'm
not...
you
know,
i'm
not
interpolating.
those
are
the
very
words
the
court
used,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
case
at
hand.
now
why
do
you
say
that
a
rule
that
doesn't
apply
was
found
to
have
been
violated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
federal
rule
that
they
misapplied
is
not
mclaughlin,
it's
griffith.
it's
griffith
is
the
federal
rule
that
was
misapplied,
that
the
case
was...
that
did
apply
to
judgments--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
have
jurisdiction.
there's
no
question
we
have
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that...
you
do
agree
that
was
a
federal
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
based
on
that
violation
of
a
federal
rule,
this
court
had
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
nothing
to
be
said
against
that,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
they've
made
arguments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
subscribe
to
those
arguments,
do
you?
