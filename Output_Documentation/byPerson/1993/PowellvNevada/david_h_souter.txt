justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
pescetta,
i'm
sure
that
is
one
of
our
options,
and
i
guess
in
my
mind
whether
it's
an
option
we
should
take
or
not
depends
on
the
probability
that
nevada
will
decide
the
exclusionary
issue
in
a
way
which
is,
number
one,
dispositive
of
the
case
and,
b,
strictly
on
state
law
grounds.
if
there
were
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
decision
on
federal
grounds,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
might
be
prudent
for
us
to
go
further
here.
can
you...
can
you
tell
me
categorically
that
in
fact
nevada's
state
law
rule,
as
distinct
from
nevada's
readiness
to
follow
any
federal
exclusionary
rule,
would
be,
so
far
as
you
understand
it,
dispositive
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words
what
i'm
getting
at
is
what
is
the
probability
that
if
we
rule
as
narrowly
as
you
submit
we
should
do,
that
in
fact
we
will
simply...
that
we
will
have
done
anything
more
than
perhaps
engage
in
a
summary
reversal
which
will
turn
out
to
be
of
no
significance?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
let's
assume
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
said,
well,
we're
going
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court
for
a
consideration
of
harmlessness
or
a
consideration
of
the
somewhat
broader
issue
of
attenuation.
the
nevada
supreme
court
could
perfectly
well
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
would
it
give
a
state
remedy
for
a
statute
which
it
found
was
inapplicable
because
of
its
misunderstanding
of
retroactivity?
