mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
by
answering
the
question
that
was
posed
at
the
outset
concerning
the
possibility
of
state
remedies,
and
by
saying
that
there
is
no
reason
to
think
in
this
case
that
there
is
any
state
remedy.
in
powell's
view,
the
state
court
in
this
case,
a,
found
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
blatantly
violated
but,
b,
refused
to
give
a
federal
remedy
based
on
what
everyone
now
says
is
a
wrong
view
of
federal
retroactivity
rule...
rules.
if
there
were
indeed...
if
there
were
indeed
a
separate
and
independent
state
remedy,
the
supreme
court
of
nevada,
by
hypothesis
having
found
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated,
surely
would
have
granted
it.
and
indeed
it
is
a
little
bit
strange
that
the
principle
authority
cited
for
the
claim
that
there
is
an
independent
state
remedy
in
this
court
is
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
in
this
case
which,
if
it
stands
for
anything,
is
that
there
is
no
state
remedy
for--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
did
not...
there
are
two
different
issues,
justice
souter.
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
stated
in
its
opinion
that
there
is
a
remedy,
much
like
the
mcnabb-mallory
remedy,
for
the
violation
of
its
statute.
it
also
stated
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
right
is
waiveable.
now,
neither
of
those
two
statements
have
anything
to
do
with
the
error
of
federal
law
that
the
court
made,
which
is
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
there
is
no
federal
remedy
available
in
this
case.
if
we
concede
the
premise
for
this
court's
having
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
claim
that
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
necessarily
found
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
this
case,
then
it
must
follow
that
there
can
be
no
independent
state
remedy
for
that
since
if
there
were,
the
court
surely
would
have
given
it.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
what
they
said
was
it
is
not
retroactive
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
justice
ginsburg,
which
if...
which
is
a
statement--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
but
they
wouldn't
have
to.
and
unless
there
is
something
in
what
the
court
did
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
court
felt
compelled
by
its
reading
of
federal
law
to
say
that
there
is
no
state
remedy,
the
court,
having
found
that
the
constitution
was
violated,
would
have
given
a
state
remedy
if
there
were
one.
truly--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
court
did
find
by
hypothesis
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
refused
to
give
a
federal
remedy
based
on
an
error
of
federal
law,
but
that
didn't
keep
the
state
from
granting
a
state
remedy
if
there
were
one.
the
problem
with
the
argument
is
that
the
remedy
that
there
is
is
a
mcnabb-mallory
remedy,
which
the
court
stated
is
tailored
to
fifth
amendment
interests
and
which,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
is
waiveable.
now--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i...
we
don't
read
the...
what
the
court
said
as
indicating
that
the
court
felt
compelled
to
deny
a
state
remedy
based
on
federal
law.
and
unless
the
court
can
be
read
to
have
said
so,
the
judgment
it
rendered
in
this
very
case
is
evidence
for
the
view
that
there
is
no
independent
state
remedy,
and
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
think
what
they
were
saying,
and
as
we
read
it,
justice
stevens,
is
to
say
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
was
taking
not
our
statement
of
what
they
did,
but
their
statement
as
to
why
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
which
is
that
the
highest
state
court
chose
to
notice
a
plain
error
and
to
waive
a
bar.
if
the
state
court
didn't
do
that,
then
there
is
a
bar
to
this
court's
jurisdiction.
if
we
take
their--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
of
course.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
we
do
agree
that
the
griffith
rule
was
misapplied.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
and
we
do--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
that
there's
certainly
much
to
be
said
for
that
view.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the
state
has
made
an
argument
to--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
opposite
effect.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
have
not
subscribed
one
way
or
the
other
to
any
view,
and
we're
happy
to
go
forward
on
the
view
that
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
from
what
the
court
did
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
that
would
lead
one
to
think
that
there
is
an
independent
state
remedy,
because
the
court
stated
the
state
rule
as
being
one
designed
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
right
and
one,
in
that
light,
which
is
waiveable
under
state
law,
and
it
found
it
waived.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
would
not
disagree
with
you
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court...
this
court
has
always
held
that
it
does
not
sit
to
overturn
statements
in
opinions,
and
if
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
and
we
say
there
is
not
despite
the
error
in
the
statement,
then
the
judgment
should
not
be
overturned.
in
our
view,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
because,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
statement
is
not
a
fruit
of
the
timing
violation
on
which
the
petitioner
relies,
and
the
good
faith
exception
would
apply
to
bar
suppression
even
if
the
statement
is
deemed
a
fruit
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that's...
i
mean
obviously
reasonable
minds
can
disagree
about
how
what
the
court
did
may
be
read.
all
we're
saying
is
that
our
reading
is
that
it
is
fair
to
infer
that
there
is
no
state
remedy,
and
in
the
light
of
that,
the
only
issue
for
the
court
is
whether
there
is
a
federal
remedy.
and
for...
based
on
cases
like
harris
and
motalvo,
we
think
that
it
is
reasonably
clear
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
there
is
no
federal
remedy
if
there's--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--because
we
also...
we
only
learned
of
the
existence
of
the
case
after
the
case
had
been
granted,
which
we
take
to
be
an
indication
that
the
court
is
interested
in
dealing
with
the
federal
issues
that
there
may
be
in
the
case.
and
in
light
of
that
assumption,
we
thought
that
we
would
come
into
the
case
and
give
the
court
our
views
as
to
the
federal
issues,
which
are
as
we
have
stated
in
our
brief.
and
i
thank
the
court.
