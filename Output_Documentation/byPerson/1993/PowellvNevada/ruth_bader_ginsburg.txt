justice
ruth
bader

mr.
pescetta,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
if
the
nevada
supreme
court
had
not
on
its
own
brought
up
mclaughlin,
it
would
not
be
in
this
case.
you
would
have
forfeited
it
because
the
only
thing
that
was
raised
by
powell
was
arraignment
and
not
probable
cause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't
in
this
case
until
the
nevada
supreme
court
put
it
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
it
be
possible
for
the
nevada
supreme
court
to
say
on
remand,
sorry,
we
certainly
made
a
mistake;
had
we
realized
that
mclaughlin
had
to
be
retroactive,
we
never
would
have
brought
it
up,
and
so
now
we're
deleting
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you've
just
told
me
in
answer
to
the
first
question
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
might,
you
said,
wriggle
out
of
it.
or
to
say
we
started
out
with
a
question
about
arraignment
under
nevada
law,
and
then
we
picked
up
mclaughlin
on
our
own
and
made
a
mistake
in
failing
to
understand
that
it
is
retroactive,
and
then
we
returned
and,
in
fact,
our
decision
was
about
the
arraignment
nevada
state
law
ground.
couldn't
this
case
go
back
and
the
nevada
supreme
court
could
say
thank
you
for
the
instruction
about
mclaughlin,
we
now
understand
that
it's
retroactive,
it
was
never
raised
by
powell,
our
decision
on
arraignment
stands
just
the
way
we
wrote
it?
just
take
out
those
paragraphs
about
mclaughlin
and
we've
got
a
decision
based
solely
on
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
souter
asked
you
what
could
the
nevada
supreme
court
do
on
remand
and
would
you
represent
that,
indeed,
they
would
exclude
this
evidence.
you
have
already,
i
think,
quite
candidly
said
the
nevada
supreme
court
could
nonetheless
decide
this
case
on
the
state
ground
that
they
started
and
ended
with,
that
is
the
arraignment
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would
it
be
unfair
to
say
that
this
is
a
defense
that
you
forfeited
and
therefore
we're
going
to
make
it
clear
that
all
we
were
trying
to
do
was
to
tell
the
troops
in
nevada
from
now
on
you've
got
to
adhere
to
the
45...
48-hour
standard?
we
said
that
en
passant
in
a
case
that
was
about
arraignment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
cannot
reach.
if
it's
a
pure
question
of
state
law,
which
nevada
seems
to
have
treated
it.
the
arraignment
question
was
raised,
as
i
understand
it,
as
a
question
of
state
law,
it
was
resolved
as
a
question
of
state
law,
then
this
court
has
no
business
with
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
it
correctly,
everything
that
they
said
about
waiver
because
of
the
miranda
warnings,
that
all
tied
into
the
arraignment
state
ground
and
they
were
not
dealing
with
any
federal
right
anymore
because
they
thought
incorrectly
that
mclaughlin
wasn't
retroactive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
is
an
opinion
that
starts
with
state
law
arraignment,
shifts
to
federal
probable
cause,
says
federal
probable
cause
is
not
retroactive,
goes
back
to
arraignment
and
continues
down
the
line
with
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
could
find
is
that
the
november
7
statement
was
essentially
duplicative,
so
whatever
error
existed
was
harmless
because
the
same...
statements
to
the
same
effect
had
been
made
on
november
3,
which
was
well
within
the
48
hours?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
the
bottom
line
from
that.
if...
the
nevada
supreme
court
conceivably
could
say
that
the
november
7
statement
is
simply
a
repetition
of
the
statement
made
on
november
3rd
and
therefore
it
was...
whatever
was
harmless.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
haven't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
suppose
they
did
that,
would
that
be
the
end
of
the
case?
i
mean
what
federal
question
would
you
have
left
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
the
nevada
supreme
court's
opinion
indicate
that
they
even
thought
that
if
there
had
been...
if
the
mclaughlin
decision
is
retroactive,
as
everyone
agrees
it
is,
they
would
have
to
just
release
this
defendant?
i
mean
that's
what
the
footnote,
i
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
this
curious
opinion
came
down,
you
didn't
ask
to
have
it
clarified,
because
it
goes
from
first
appearance,
as
you
call
it,
and
then
it
shifts
to
this
mclaughlin
probable
cause,
and
then
goes
back
to
first
appearance?
so
it
would
be,
apart
from
this
intrusion
of
mclaughlin
and
the
slip,
an
entirely
state
law
decision
that
would
have
no
place
in
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't...
when
this
curious
thing
came
out
about
mclaughlin
and
you
didn't
know
how
it
got
in
there...
it
certainly
wasn't
asked
for
by
either
of
the
parties...
you
didn't
ask
the
court
to
alter
or
amend
its
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
couldn't,
then,
on
remand...
if
we
were
to
say,
nevada
supreme
court,
mclaughlin's
retroactive,
couldn't
they
then
say,
thank
you
for
that
information
about
federal
law.
now
we
understand
that
this
case
was
about
arraignment.
it
started
there,
it
ended
there.
we
never
would
have
intruded
this
suggestion
on
our
own,
if
we
had
known
that
what
we
were
saying
was
incorrect
about
the
retroactivity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
estrada,
i
don't
follow
that
line
of
reasoning,
because
i
thought
the
nevada
supreme
court
was
saying
there
was
a
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
right,
but
it's
not
retroactive,
and
are
we
glad
it
isn't
retroactive
because
if
it
were
we
would
have
to
release
this
man
from
incarceration
totally,
not
simply
exclude
the
statement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
should
it
be
retroactive
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
they...
wouldn't
they
think
that
the
state
law,
at
least
in
that
respect,
would
be
the
same
as
the
federal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
it
be...
wouldn't
it
have
been
appropriate
for
the...
to...
instead
of
asking
the
court
to
decide
what
is
a
fairly
weighty
question,
what
are
the
consequences
of
a
mclaughlin
violation,
to
say
this
is
a
very
poor
case
in
which
to
make
any
such
decision;
there
are
two
paragraphs
thrown
into
an
opinion
that's
all
about
state
law.
why
are
you
urging
the
court
to
make
a
significant
decision
in
a
case
where
this
issue
just
crept
into
the
case,
was
in
and
out
before
anybody
could
notice
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
are
you
arguing
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
is
estopped?
powell
didn't
raise
this
issue.
the
court
did
on
it's
own.
and
you're
saying
that
now
having
raised
it,
the
court
is
estopped
from
withdrawing
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
that
be
a
federal
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
the
court
itself
injected.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
retroactivity
of
the
court's
1991
decision
in
county
of
riverside
against
mclaughlin.
when
a
person
is
arrested
without
a
warrant,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
him
against
unreasonable
seizures
post
for
a
prompt
judicial
determination
whether
probable
cause
exists
for
continuing
the
person
in
detention.
as
a
rule,
mclaughlin
held
prompt
means
within
48
hours.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
kitrich
powell,
charged
in
late
1989
with
the
murder
of
his
girlfriend's
four-year-old
daughter,
was
detained
by
nevada
police
for
four
days
before
a
magistrate
confirmed
the
existence
of
probable
cause
to
jail
him
pending
prosecution.
the
nevada
supreme
court
in
1992
held
that
the
48-hour
rule
prescribed
in
mclaughlin
was
inapplicable
in
powell's
case
because
our
1991
decision
issued
many
months
after
powell's
1989
arrest.
in
so
ruling,
the
nevada
supreme
court
overlooked
grifitth
v.
kentucky,
a
1987
decision,
in
which
we
declared
a
rule
for
the
conduct
of
criminal
prosecutions
is
to
be
applied
retroactively
to
all
cases,
state
or
federal,
not
yet
final
when
the
rule
is
announced.
we,
therefore,
vacate
the
nevada
supreme
court's
judgment.
our
decision
does
not
mean
powell
will
succeed
in
overturning
his
conviction
where
several
questions
remain
open
on
remand.
most
prominently,
the
nevada
supreme
court
has
yet
to
consider
closely
the
appropriate
remedy
for
a
delay
in
determining
probable
cause
for
detention
pending
prosecution.
that
issue
is
one
this
court
did
not
address
in
mclaughlin.
justice
thomas
joined
by
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
