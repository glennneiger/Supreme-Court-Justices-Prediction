mr.
dan
m.
seaton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
we
go
further,
i
would
like
to
clearly
delineate
what
the
nevada
procedure
was
in
november
of
1989.
when
a
prisoner
was
taken
to
the...
when
he
was
arrested,
he
would
be
taken
to
the
booking
desk,
at
which
time
the
various
booking
procedures
would
go
on.
either
simultaneous
with
that
or
immediately
thereafter
at
the
jail--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--this
is
in
clark
county,
nevada,
yes,
it
is.
immediately
after
at
least
the
booking
procedure,
the
police
officer
who
was
in
charge
of
the
arrest,
in
this
case
detective
al
leavitt,
would
fill
out
what
is
known
as
the
affidavit
of
probable
cause,
along
with
other
papers.
copies
of
those
and
the
original
would
go
to
various
places.
one
of
them
would
go
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
across
the
street
in
the
courthouse.
that
justice
of
the
peace,
in
those
days,
within
72
hours,
excluding
weekends
and
holidays,
would
read
the
declaration
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
hold
the
prisoner
for
any
greater
length
of
time.
completely
separate
and
apart
from
the
procedure
in
nevada,
at
that
time
and
today,
is
the
procedure
of
first
appearance,
and
that
is
governed
entirely
by
nrs,
nevada
revised
statute
171.178.
and
that
statute
really
says
just
about
the
same
thing,
that
within
72
hours,
excluding
weekends
and
holidays,
the
prisoner
must
be
brought
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
for
a
first
appearance,
at
which
time
that
person
is
then
advised
of
the
various
rights
that
attach
to
his
proceedings.
so
that
the
court
understands
fully,
the
procedures
then
are
similar
in
that
the
time
limitations
put
forth
by
the
legislature
in
the
first
appearance
statute
were
used
as
guidelines
by
nevada
officials
or
police
officers
in
determining
how
quickly
they
had
to
obey
the
prompt
dictate
of
gerstein.
and
they
chose
to
utilize
the
72
hours.
the
defendant
in
this
case
has
never,
until
coming
before
this
court,
objected
to
any
sort
of
a
probable
cause
difficulty.
it
has
always
been
couched
in
terms
of
a
delay
in
first
appearance.
and,
indeed,
the
nevada
supreme
court
began
its
opinion
in
this
particular
area,
recognizing
that
that
was
the
specific
claim.
now,
since
i
would
prefer
to
spend
most
of
my
time
discussing
the
substantive
issues
that
are
before
this
court
relative
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
i
would
like
to
say
a
brief
word
about
jurisdiction
and
then
go
on
to
that
area.
as
i
stated,
the
issue
has
always
been
framed
in
terms
of
first
appearance
and
not
in
probable
cause.
probable
cause,
as
it
relates
to
the
nevada
supreme
court's
opinion,
is
relevant
only
if
those
two
procedures,
probable
cause
and
first
appearance,
are
combined.
and
they
are
not
in
nevada;
never
have
been
and
are
not
today.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
there
was.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
it
was...
on
november
the
7th.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
it
was
beyond
the
time
in
mclaughlin.
it
was
done
18--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--yes,
it
is
retroactive,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
proposition.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
there
was...
using
the
retroactivity
analysis,
there
was
a
mclaughlin
violation,
yes.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
it
is.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
if...
yes,
they
were
wrong
on
saying
that
mclaughlin
was
not
retroactive.
but
mclaughlin...
the
discussion
in
mclaughlin
was
not
dispositive
of
the
issue
that
was
before
the
court.
the
mclaughlin
decision
has
nothing
to
do
with
first
appearances.
the
mclaughlin
discussion
by
the
nevada
supreme
court
had
no
place
in
this
discussion
of
why...
whether
or
not
there
was
an
inappropriate
delay
in
first
appearance.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
it
is
not...
we
are
not
able
to
do
that,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
we
are
not
able
to
make
such
a
conclusion.
the
nevada
supreme
court,
just
going
from
the--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--well,
the
footnote
does
seem
to
indicate
that,
and
that
clearly
is
not
the
law
in
the
state
of
nevada
and
they
have
so
said.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
i
wish
i
knew
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
the
question.
what
i
do
know--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--i
agree.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
that--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--we...
my
knowledge
of
the
appellate
procedure
that
took
place
was
that
upon
receiving
the
opinion,
a
motion
for
rehearing
was
asked
for.
in
fact,
if
memory
serves
me
correct,
both
parties
asked
for
that
rehearing.
it
was
declined
and
the
supreme
court
chose
not
to
have
a
rehearing,
but
to
rely
on
their
judgment
as
they
wrote
it.
and
other
than
that,
i
can't
offer
an
explanation
as
to
why
they
did
what
they
did,
but
i
can
offer
the
conclusion
that
what
they
did
really
had
no
bearing
on
the
only
question
that
was
before
the
court.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
they
could
take
that
position.
i
think
what
i
would
forward
to
the
court
at
this
time
is
that
it's
unnecessary
to
do
that.
i
believe
that
the
judgment
below,
even
though
torturously
gotten
to,
was
correct.
i
believe
that
the
way
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
ultimately
disposed
of
the
case
is
a
correct
one,
and
that
for
this
court
to
send
it
back
for
that
kind
of
correcting
would
render
this
court's
judgment
not
more...
much
more
than
an
advisory
opinion,
which
i
know
it
prefers
not
to
do.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
there
was
not.
on
november
7th
the
only
thing
that
happened
was
an
ex
parte
reading
by
the
justice
of
the
peace
of
the
declaration
of
arrest.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
it
is
simply
mclaughlin.
the
first
appearance
occurred
late
on
november
the
13th,
1989.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
so
clearly
in
this
case
two
separate
proceedings
were
had.
and
whether
the
court,
the
nevada
supreme
court--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--it
is
not.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
one
reading
of
the
opinion
might
be
very
similar
to
what
you're
suggesting.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
that
sentence
says
that.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
well,
the
court
might
have
been,
at
that
particular
moment,
deciding
to--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
something
other--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--no,
not
to
my
recollection,
and
that
is
what
i
think
befuddles
some
of
us.
because
they
started
off
talking
about
first
appearance
and
then
all
of
a
sudden,
recognizing
the
mclaughlin
decision,
started
talking
about
it
as
though
it
applied
to
the
statutory
first
appearance
when
it...
in
fact,
it
did
not.
and
then
they
finished
up,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
by
holding
their
decision
based
on
nevada
waiver
law
of
the
miranda
right.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
yes,
i
am
arguing
that.
and
the
authority--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--my
answer
to
justice
kennedy
a
few
moments
ago,
that
the
probable
cause
hearing
in
this
case
was
held
on
november
the
7th,
and
on
november
the
13th
the
first
appearance
was
held.
that
shows,
in
fact,
in
this
case
there
were
two
separate
proceedings.
the--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--no,
it
could
be
correct.
obviously,
california
does
that
in
some
of
their
counties.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
well,
and
if
they're
saying
that,
and
we
don't
know
that
that's
what
they're
saying--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--well,
i
don't
know
if
that's
what
that
sentence
means.
[laughter]
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
yes,
they
are
still
separate
proceedings.
they
have
never
been
combined.
in
the
years
since
gerstein,
i
have
not
once
seen
a
probable
cause
determination
made
at
the
same
time
that
a
first
appearance
is
made.
there's
no
case
holding.
the
statute
in
question,
the
first
appearance
statute,
alludes
absolutely
not
at
all
to
probable
cause.
that
is
an
animal
that
has
come
about,
i
think,
by
virtue
of
the
gerstein
decision,
and
our
state's
efforts
by
local
rule
to
abide
by
it.
and
in
doing
that,
they
chose
to
follow
the
72-hour
rule
that
was
announced
in
the...
in
the
first
appearance--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--well,
in
respect...
with
respect
to
my
opposing
counsel's
statement,
i
would
tell
the
court
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
in
those
line...
in
that
line
of
cases
has
stated
what
the
rule
is
in
almost
all
of
the
united
states,
and
that
is
that
the
mcnabb-mallory
line
of
cases
do
not
have
to
apply
to
the
states.
and
our
state
does
not
follow
that
line
of
cases.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
it
has
not.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
and
i
say
that,
if
i
might
just
follow
up
on
it,
because
in
nevada
there
are
a
dearth
of
cases,
if
there
are
any
at
all,
which
discuss
the
problem
that
faces
us
here,
that
discusses
any
sort
of
a
probable
cause
difficulty.
all
of
the
cases
talk
about
first
appearance.
that
factor
may
have
been
something
that
aided
the
court
in
making
its
wrongful
assumptions.
it
was
just
so
unfamiliar
with
a
local
procedure
which
had
not
ever
before
come
before
it,
that
it,
in
reading
mclaughlin,
just
assumed
that
it
applied
back
to
the
first
appearance
statute.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
unless
it
is
continued
for
that
purpose,
it
is.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
i
can't
tell
you
whether
or
not
there
was
a
continuation,
but
the...
but
when
they
finally
had
the
first
appearance--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--it
was
an
arraignment,
to
the
best
of
my
understanding.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
that
is
the
procedure
in
nevada.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
our
first
appearances
cannot
take
place
ex
parte.
they
may...
must
take
place
in
front
of
the
justice
of
the
peace.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
i
believe
eventually,
given
continuances,
they
are
always
the
arraignment.
the--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--no.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
it
does
not
happen.
it
could
happen,
yes,
if
a
judge
somehow
summoned
a
defendant
before
him
in
his
chambers
where
the
probable
cause
hearings
are
held,
that
could
happen.
i--
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
--that
could
be
a
possible
reading
of
the
nevada
case.
that
has
not
happened
since
that
time,
and
i
believe
in
the
event
that
a
remand
does
occur
for
the
nevada
supreme
court
to
clarify
its
opinion,
it
will
go
along
with
its
past
practices.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
not
that
i
ever
read.
mr.
dan
m.
seaton
that's
correct.
with
the
very
short
remaining
time
that
i
have
left,
i
would
simply
like
to
go
on
past
these
aspects
of
the
case
and
suggest
to
the
court
that
are...
there
are
two
reasons,
which
have
been
fairly
fully
briefed
in
our
briefs,
why
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
particular
case,
or
cases
like
it,
should
not
occur.
and
one
of
them
clearly
is
that
in
this
particular
case
the
statement,
the
confession,
if
you
will,
of
the
defendant,
was
clearly
not
the
fruit
of
the
delay
in
the
finding
of
probable
cause
that
occurred
in
this
particular
case.
and
we
know
that
if
there
is
no
causal
link
to
the
violation,
then
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
work.
and
this
case
seems
to
be
somewhat
analogous
to
the
reasoning
at
least
behind
the
case
of
new
york
v.
harris.
and
this
case,
like
that
one,
the
probable
cause
existed
at
the
very
beginning.
some
sort
of
a
bad
intervening
event
happened.
in
powell
it
was
a
payton
arrest.
in
this
case
it's
a
delay
of
a
finding
of
probable
cause,
which
i
would
want
to
remind
the
court
that
there
always
was
probable
cause.
the
affidavit
which
was
eventually
viewed
and
ruled
upon
never
changed.
there
was
no
exploitation
of
any
delay
to
change
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
that
particular
affidavit.
and
the
court
in
harris
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
custody,
albeit
the...
for
the
payton
violation,
that
custody
was
still
lawful.
and
in
this
case,
i
would
say
that
the
custody
is
still
lawful
even
though
there
is
a
delay.
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation
because
of
the
delay,
but
it
doesn't
render
the
custody
unlawful.
and
the
confession
or
statement,
then,
is
not
a
product
of
the
delay.
it,
like
the
one
in
harris,
is
the
product
of
the
probable
cause
arrest,
an
appropriate
arrest.
a
man
should
be
in
prison...
or
in
jail,
i'm
sorry,
for
the
things
that
he
has
done
and
that
the
police
know
about
at
that
time.
they
are
then
entitled
to
go
ask
questions
of
him,
which
they
did.
and
we
have
to
remember
that...
as
was
brought
out
in
the
earlier
argument,
that
those
same
statements
were
gotten
from
him
several
times.
six
times
before,
i
believe,
he
told
people
how
these
particular
injuries
occurred.
he
was
more
than
willing,
in
fact
even
eager
to
tell
that
story.
and
so
there
can
be
no
reasonable
assumption,
i
believe,
here
that
the
statements
in
question
were
in
any
way
the
product
of
some
sort
of
a
delay.
had
the
delay
not
happened,
we
still
would
have
had
the
statements.
he
still
would
have
been
willing
to
tell
us
the
same
thing
that
he
told
us
on
other
occasions.
the
other
reason
for
the
nonutilization
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case
are
the
line
of
cases
having
to
do
with
good
faith,
and
those
cases
teach
us
that
when
police
officers
reasonably
rely
on
presumptively
valid
statutes
or
search
warrants,
that
to
exclude
the
things
that
come
from
those
valid
pieces
of
evidence
is
to...
thank
you
very
much.
