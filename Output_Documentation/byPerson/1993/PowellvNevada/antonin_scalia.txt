justice
antonin
scalia
just
before
you
get
to
that,
just
one
last
inquiry
on
this.
what
concerns
me,
mr.
pescetta,
is
that
this
is
a
capital
case.
even
if
we
assume
that
we
need
not
reach
the
federal
question,
even
if
we
intend
to
remand
it
to
the
state
to
give
the
state
a
chance
of
applying
state
law
if
it
wishes,
why
shouldn't
we
nonetheless
resolve
the
federal
question
just
to
prevent
this
thing
from
ping-ponging
back
and
forth
forever?
it's
obviously
in
your
interest
to
have
this
case
decided
in
as
piecemeal
a
fashion
as
possible.
that
is
to
say
if
the
federal
issue
is
going
to
be
decided,
you
would...
because
it
might
be
decided
against
you,
you'd
rather
have
it
decided
later.
let's
send
it
back
to
nevada,
then
they
will
say,
no,
we
won't
apply
the
state
ground.
and
then
you
will
say
but
you
must
apply
the
federal
ground,
and
they
will
say,
no,
we
don't
have
to
apply
the
federal
ground,
then
it'll
come
up
to
us
and
the
thing
strings
out.
why
don't
we
terminate
this
litigation
as
completely
as
possible
now
by
deciding
the
federal
issue
so
just
in
case
the
nevada
court
doesn't
hold
the
way
you
think
it
will
on
the
state
ground,
we
will
spare
you
the
trouble
of
another
appeal
to
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
basis
of
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
made
that
finding?
i'm
sorry,
the
nevada
supreme
court
made
the
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
basis
of
nothing
in
the
record,
you
tell
us.
