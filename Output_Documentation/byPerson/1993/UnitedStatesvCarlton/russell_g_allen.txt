mr.
russell
g.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fundamental
issue
is
the
one
that
the
court
has
been
questioning,
and
that
is,
whether
there
is
a
due
process
constraint
on
the
retroactive
application
of
the
taxing
power.
i
will
suggest
that
there
is
a
limit;
that
the
case
before
you
is
one
with
very
unusual
facts,
which
clearly
demonstrate
that
the
limit
can
be
exceeded.
the
critical
element
here
is
the
element
of
specific
inducement.
i
will
close
by
addressing
the
government's
siren
song
that
it
was
simply
too
good
to
be
true.
as
justice
o'connor
reminded
us
two
years
ago
in
the
romein
decision,
retroactive
legislation
presents
more
serious
problems
of
unfairness
than
prospective
legislation,
because
it
can
deprive
citizens
of
legitimate
expectations
and
upset
settled
transactions.
and
while
we
don't
argue
about
congress'
broad
latitude
to
enact
retroactive
legislation
as
a
general
proposition,
it
is
constrained
by
due
process
from
enacting
arbitrary
and
irrational
legislation.
put
another
way,
retroactive
legislation
must
be
supported
by
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
furthered
by
a
rational
means.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
distinction,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
as
i
read
the
court's
decisions,
particularly
in
the
retroactive
tax
cases,
i
find
myself
very
confused
and
the
line
very
fuzzy
between
what
we're
talking
about.
i
think
i
can
characterize
this
in
either
fashion,
and
i'm
not
sure
that...
that,
from
my
perspective,
the
analysis
is
helped
materially
by
doing
so.
that's
clearly
a
bugaboo--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--well,
as
your
honor--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--i
suppose
it
would
depend
on
at
which
stage
you're
asking,
justice
stevens.
if
the
question
is,
would
it
have
been
different
had
they
held
more
hearings
or
considered
more
in
the
process
of
deciding
in
1987
to
amend
the
statute,
i
don't
think
that
would
make
any
difference
at
all.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
perhaps
so.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
the
estate
tax
deduction
i
believe
was
the
taxpayer's
question
to
me
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
i
believe
that,
as
a
general
proposition,
you're
correct;
that
we
do
not
have
that
sort
of
blanket.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
very
clear
precedent
from
this
court
for
the
last
200
years
that,
in
some
instances,
retroactive
legislation
does
violate
due
process.
and
there's
nothing
special
about
tax
legislation.
we
use
a
slightly
different
rubric
there.
but
whether
you...
you
look
at
the
language
from
turner
elkhorn
or
gray
on
the
one
hand,
or
hemme
and
welch
on
the
other,
we
recognize
that
sometimes
the
congress
goes
too
far
in
changing
the
tax
law
retroactively.
we
say
that
it
cannot
change
the
law
in
an
unduly
harsh
and
oppressive
way,
considering
the
nature
of
the
tax
and
the
circumstance
in
which
it's--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--i
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
depends
on
your
focus.
i
believe
that
under
the
due
process
jurisprudence
we
focus
both
on
the
taxpayer
and
on
the
purpose
of
the
government.
in
the
latter
case,
the
purpose
of
the
government,
it
may
simply
be
an
explanation
and
not
a
test.
in
the
former,
when
we
are
looking
at
the
arbitrariness
of
the
retroactive
change,
there
we're
focusing
on
the
taxpayer.
and
there
i
believe
harsh
and
oppressive
does
become
a
test
in
and
of
itself.
the
retroactive
application
here
is
arbitrary.
it's
arbitrary
as
defined
by
justice
stone
in
the
welch
case,
when
he
summarized
the
series
of
cases
that
had
been
decided
over
the
prior
decade.
he
found
in
those
cases
a
unifying
theme,
that
where
the
taxpayer
could
not
reasonably
have
anticipated
that
he
or
she
might
be
taxed
as
a
result
of
a
transaction--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--the
beneficiaries
are
the
four
children
of
willametta
day,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
it
seems
to
me
that
but
for
the
specific
inducement
of
this
statute,
the
executor
would
have
committed
a
very
clear
breach
of
trust,
by
selling
off
the
market
and
below
market
value.
given
the
specific
inducement
of
this
statute,
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
beneficiaries
to
challenge
the
reasonableness
of
the
executor's
activity.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
you
might
say
that,
your
honor,
but
i
certainly
couldn't.
[laughter]
mr.
russell
g.
allen
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
i
would
not
define
it
in
$600,000
as
much
as
i
would
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
taken
as
a
whole.
here
we--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--well,
it
isn't
always
easy
to
do
as
much
as
one
might
hypothetically
want
to
do.
there's
a
practical
limit,
particularly
in
this
case.
the
president
signed
the
bill
on
october
22nd.
congress
adjourned
a
bit
after
that.
mrs.
day's
return,
even
on
extension,
was
due
december
29th.
there
are
some
practical
limits
in
how
much
stock
you
could
afford
to
buy
without
doing
the
sort
of
churning
that
mr.
jones
suggests
some
might.
there
is
a
practical
limit
to
how
much
you
can
afford
to
buy.
there's
a
practical
limit
to
how
much
an
esop
may
want
to
purchase...
or
esop's
may
want
to
purchase.
so,
you're
quite
correct
that
the
taxpayer
here,
even
under
our
view
of
the
law,
paid
eighteen-and-a-half
million
dollars
in
estate
tax.
this
isn't
a
case
of--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--at
least
in
theory
we
certainly
could
have,
your
honor.
in
practice
it
might
not
have
been
quite
so
easy.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
the
amount
of
the
discount
was
determined
in
bargaining
between
the
executor
and
a
representative
of
the
esop
after
the
stock
had
been
acquired.
that
led
to
a
sharing
of
roughly
80/20,
with
the
esop
getting
about
a
half-million
dollars
more
stock
than
it
otherwise
could
have
purchased.
just
as
in
the
old--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
esop
was
able
to
purchase
a
half-million
dollars
more
stock
than
it
otherwise
could
have.
if
you
look
at
the
income
tax
exclusion
for
banks,
under
section
133,
that
make
loans
to
esop's
to
buy
stock,
that
provision
allows
the
bank
to
negotiate
the
interest
rate.
and
if
you
look
at...
i
believe
it's...
footnote
eight
of
the
joint
committee
study
that
the
government
cites
in
its
brief,
it
reflects
that
an
industry
pattern
at
the
time
of
perhaps
an
interest
rate
80
percent
of
prime
or
80
percent
of
what
otherwise
would
have
been
charged
in
that
context.
in
the
context
of
the
old
estate
tax
provision
that
allowed
an
esop
to
assume
estate
tax
liability
as
part
of
an
esop
purchase,
there
was
no
particular
requirement
of
a
discount
or
any
particular
sharing.
and
the
same
is
true
under
the
income
tax
deferral
provision
for
closely
held
stockholders
who
sell
to
esop's.
so,
in
this
case,
the
negotiation
led
us
to
about
a
half-million
dollars
more
stock
to
the
esop
than
it
otherwise
could
have
purchased.
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
that
said
one
way
or
another
how
much
was
appropriate
or
reasonable.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
problems
with
the
government's
"too
good
to
be
true"
argument.
one
is
a...
one
is
a
factual
problem
and
the
other
is
an
analytic
one.
on
a
factual
basis,
there
simply
is
nothing
there
to
support
the
government's
argument
in
this
case.
the
president
signed
the
bill.
the
congress
amended
the
bill
several
times
before
it
adjourned.
the
congress
considered
several
hundred
other
technical
corrections
that
it
didn't
enact,
one
of
which
specifically
dealt
with
this
section,
and
proposed
to
delete--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--but
as
one
of
the
questions
directed
to
the
solicitor
general
noted,
we...
the
"too
good
to
be
true"
doesn't
reflect
anything
in
the
economics
of
the
transaction.
if
mrs.
day
had
been
an
investor
in
mci
on
the
day
it
was
incorporated,
or
if
indeed
she
had
bought
the
stock
on
her
deathbed,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
the
transaction
would
have
been
any
different
or
the
economic
positions
of
the
parties.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
that's
right.
if
you
want
to
get
more
stock
in
the
hands
of
esop's,
this
is
a
great
way
to
motivate
people
to
do
that.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
from
an
analytic
perspective,
we
have
a
tremendous
difficulty
in
telling
when
something
is
too
good
to
be
true,
when
it
is
intended,
just
before
russell
long
retires,
as
opposed
to
when
it
was
a
mistake
according
to
the
leaders
of
the
next
congress,
a
week
after
he
retired.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
at
the
time
the
executor
made
this
sale,
that
is
exactly
true,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor.
at
the
time
this
took
place,
the
government
signed
the
bill
on
october
22nd.
congress
considered
some
amendments.
they
passed
a
couple.
they
considered
a
lot
more.
they
adjourned.
the
executor
engaged
in
this
transaction.
three--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--we
might
have
ended
up
with
a
lot
more
stock
in
the
hands
of
esop's.
three
weeks--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
there
may
well
be,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
were
a
very
clear
and
distinct
conflict
between
the
legislative
history
and
the
language
of
the
statute,
there
may
be
room
for
that
kind
of
argument.
if
the
executive
branch
or
if
the
congress
has
under
public
consideration
a
proposal
to
change,
there
may
be
a
"too
good
to
be
true"
kind
of
notion.
but
here,
the
executor
acted
three
weeks...
two-and-a-half
weeks
before
the
wall
street
journal
article
that
the
government
cites
in
its
reply
brief
for
the
first
time,
and
this
morning;
three
weeks...
one
more
week...
before
the
internal
revenue
service's
first
hint
of
a
proposed
change
or
suggestion
of
a
mistake;
four
months
before
the
legislation
was
introduced
to
cure
the
problem;
and
14
months
before
the
legislation
was
passed.
now,
you
can
go
further
down
the
line
and
say,
maybe
at
some
point
somebody
should
have
said,
we
cannot
reasonably
anticipate
the
end
result
of
this
transaction.
but
you
have
to
remember
that
the
facts
in
this
case
arose
several
weeks
before
any
of
that
took
place.
and
it
took
place--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--i
know
of
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
for
which
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
at
this
time...
i
know
of
nothing
at
this
time,
as
of
the
time
that
the
executor
acted
in
this
case.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
with
due
respect,
your
honor.
too
good
to
be
true
has
these
factual
problems
that
we've
been
talking
about
and
that
are
talked
at
length
in
the
brief.
but
it
has--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--this
provision
was
part
of
the
tax
reform
act
of
1986,
which
was
a
major
piece
of
tax
legislation.
it
may
be
worthwhile
to
note
that
at
senator
long's
request
this
provision,
as
a
group
of
a
small
provisions
dealing
with
esop's,
was
subject
to
a
separate
vote,
which,
in
the
senate,
was
99-0.
there's
an
analytic
problem
with
this
"too
good
to
be
true",
besides
the
factual
problem.
to
use
the
classical
illusion,
it
is
a
siren
song.
it
would
lure
the
court
onto
the
rocks
of
second-guessing
the
congress.
when
is
something
a
mistake,
as
opposed
to
a
change
in
policy?
how
do
we
know
when
it's
too
good
to
be
true?
if
we
take
the
government's
argument
in
its
reply
brief
literally,
then
the
taxpayer
and
this
court
should
engage
in
an
economic
analysis
to
compare
the
benefits
of
this
esop
subsidy
with
other
esop
subsidies
and
say
that
this
one
is
much
greater
congressional
largesse,
to
use
their
term.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
i
believe,
your
honor,
it
also,
in
its
reply
brief,
argues,
at
footnotes
eight
and
nine,
that
this
was
too
good
to
be
true
because
of
the
magnitude
of
government
largesse.
it's
not
easy
to
tell
what
the
economic
benefit
of
a
tax
subsidy
or
a
tax
expenditure
provision
is.
for
example,
in
this
case,
in
the
9th
circuit,
judge
norris
made
a
fundamental
flaw
in
his
analysis
that
the
government
has
picked
up
and
repeated
in
its
reply
brief.
if
a
bank
otherwise
would
make
a
loan
at
a
10
percent
interest
rate,
and
loans
a
dollar
to
an
esop
to
buy
stock,
the
bank
excludes
half
the
interest
income
from
its
interest
income
reported
on
its
income
tax
return,
the
fisc
has
lost
five
cents
of
the
tax
base.
that's
true.
but
the
esop
is
not
better
off
by
a
dollar
as
suggested
in
judge
norris'
opinion,
or
in
the
brief.
the
esop
still
has
to
pay
the
dollar
back
to
the
bank.
it's
only
better
off
by
the
interest
savings
over
the
life
of
the
loan,
which
allows
it
to
buy
a
little
more
stock.
going
through
this
is
not
easy
stuff.
i
suggest
that
to
determine
the
cost
to
the
fisc
you
have
to
look
at
the
marginal
tax
rate
of
the
selling
shareholder,
or
the
loaning
bank,
you
need
to
look
at
the
discount
rate
to
be
applied
to
future
payments
to
discount
them
back
to
present
value,
you
need
to
think
about
the
amount
of
the
bargain
in
either
the
sales
price
or
the
interest
rate.
in
some
cases,
you
need
to
think
about
the
capital
structure
of
the
employer.
this
may
be
a
worthwhile
exercise
for
the
joint
committee
staff,
or
some
ph.d.
candidate
in
finance
with
some
elaborate
computer
models,
but
it's
not
something
that
counsel
or
the
court,
i
respectfully
suggest,
is
in
a
position
to
assess.
it
leads
the
court,
if
it
adopts
the
government's
rationale--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--i
don't
believe
that
our
analysis
necessarily
goes
that
far,
justice
stevens.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
there
is
a
temporal
element
here
of
how
back...
far
back
one
can
go.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
and
i
also
think
there
is
a
question
of
prior
history.
the
government
is
obviously
reading
something
different
in
welch
than
i
am.
i've
read
the
welch
briefs.
and
i've
read
that
opinion
more
than
once.
and
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
make
a
detrimental
reliance
in
welch.
the
government
never...
the
taxpayer
there
never
said,
i
wouldn't
have
invested
in
wisconsin
corporations.
in
fact,
he
couldn't
have
said
that.
the
introduction
to
justice
stone's
description
of
the
facts
in
that
case
goes
through
the
history
of
wisconsin
having
three
different
means
of
providing
preferential
benefits
for
in-state
dividends.
it
already
changed
it
several
times.
and
for
the
taxpayer
in
welch
to
have
said,
i
wouldn't
have
invested
in
1933
in
wisconsin
dividends
because
i
couldn't
possibly
have
foreseen
a
change.
i
mean,
the
taxpayer
couldn't
have
made
that
argument
and
in
fact
didn't
in
any
of
the
briefs.
what
welch
is--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
a
good
deal
of
jurisprudence
that
tells
us
it
isn't.
and
i
think
the
fundamental
difference
is
inherent
in
the
economics.
income
and
deductions,
gain,
loss,
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
affects
the
tax
liability
for
the
year,
just
as
much
as
what
happened
in
january
and
february.
in
a
multiyear
transaction
of
the
kind
you
posit,
that
may
involve
multiyear
taxation
of
capital
gains,
depreciation
deductions
and
tangible
drilling
costs,
whatever,
the
taxpayer,
going
in,
knows
that
we're
talking
about
an
extended
period
of
time,
and
that
there
are
economic
factors,
there
are
potential
legislative
factors--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i
thought
it
was
multiyear.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
i
misunderstood
your
hypothetical
slightly.
i
think
it
is
a
somewhat
different
case
than
this
one,
because
at
the
time
the
taxpayer
enters
into
the
transaction,
the
taxpayer
expects
to
be
taxed.
the
taxpayer
expects...
this
is
a
milliken
case,
if
you
will,
out
of
1931...
the
taxpayer
expects
that
i'm
going
to
be
paying
capital
gains
taxes.
the
congress
can
go
back
later
and
say,
well,
we're
going
to
change
the
rate,
we're
going
to
move
it
up,
we're
going
to
move
it
down,
we're
going
to
change
the
way
we
compute
the
alternative
minimum
tax.
this
is
not
the
inducement
case.
this
is
not
the
case
where,
instead
of
a
revenue--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--no--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--i
think
there
is
a
fundamental
difference,
your
honor.
here,
when
mrs.
day
died,
we
might
have
expected
to
pay
$20
million
in
estate
tax.
and,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
stipulated
record,
we
made
an
estimated
payment
of
$20
million.
between
the
time
she
died
and
the
time
the
return
was
due
and
the
tax
was
finally
determined,
the
congress
enacted
a
tax
subsidy,
a
tax
expenditure
statute.
this
wasn't
a
revenue-raising
statute.
this
statute,
from
the
get-go,
was
intended
to
cost
the
fisc
money.
and
what
the
government
has
said,
in
amending
it
twice,
is,
oops,
it's
going
to
cost
us
more
money
than
we
thought
it
was
going
to
cost
us.
we're
not
changing
a
statute
that
is
enacting
a
tax
from
people,
and
that
people
expect
to
pay,
we're
promising
them
a
benefit,
and
then
saying--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--there,
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
a
very
different
kind
of
motivational
problem.
would
the
taxpayer
have
done
it
absent
this?
would
the
taxpayer
not?
here,
as
we
noted,
when
the
government
was
arguing,
there
is
no
rational
explanation.
there
could
be
no
conceivable
motivation
for
an
executor
to
commit
what
otherwise
would
be
a
clear
breach
of
trust,
but
for
this
inducement,
this
promise
of
a
benefit.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
it's
very
difficult
to
tell,
once
we
give
in
to
the
question
of
what
motivated
them
to
do
something.
this
case
is
an
extreme
one.
and
we
don't
have
to
reach
those
hard
questions.
there
is
no
question
here
about
why
the
executor
did
what
he
did.
it
doesn't
get
fuzzy.
it
doesn't
get
murky.
it
isn't
hard.
the
taxpayer
here
doesn't
contend
that
all
retroactive
legislation,
all
retroactive
tax
legislation
is
unconstitutional.
we
have
no
argument
with
that.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
what
i'm--
mr.
russell
g.
allen
--no
executor
would
sell
at
a
below-market
price,
off
the
market,
except
to
take
advantage
of
the
estate
tax
deduction
promised.
mr.
russell
g.
allen
i'm
suggesting
that
becomes
analytically
much
more
difficult
and
much
more
complicated.
here,
where
we
have
a
clear
inducement,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
limit
to
the
due
process
clause.
we're
clearly
over
that
line
in
this
case.
the
distinguishing
factors
here
are
the
lack
of
any
basis
whatsoever
to
anticipate
the
imposition
of
the
decedent
ownership
and
plan
allocation
requirements...
clear
reliance
by
the
taxpayer,
no
other
conceivable
explanation
at
all,
a
half-million
dollars
worth
of
injury,
the
specific
inducement
that
the
government
now
seeks
to
use
to
mousetrap
the
taxpayer.
this
case,
and
the
government's
argument
here,
goes
far
beyond
any
of
the
court's
existing
case
law.
thank
you.
