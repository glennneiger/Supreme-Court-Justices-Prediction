mr.
jones,
do
you
have
many
cases
like
this
pending?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
allen,
were
you
counsel
for
the
taxpayer
at
the
time
the
income
tax
return
was
filed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
none
of
my
business;
did
you
suggest
this
deduction
or
did
the
taxpayer
say
he
wanted
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
allen,
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
this
estate?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
another
unfair
question.
you
of
course
expect
to
win
this
case.
suppose
you
don't,
is
there
a
possible
liability
on
the
part
of
the
executor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
jones,
i
assume
that
the
beneficiaries
of
the
estate
were
parties
to
this
decision
in
a
sense
of
being
advised
as
to--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
a
federal
statute
which
we
know
as
title
26
u.s.c.
section
2057
adapted
in
october
of
1986
granted
an
estate
tax
deduction
for
half
the
proceeds
of
a
sale
of
employer
securities
by
the
executor
of
the
will
of
a
decedent
to
an
employee
stock
ownership
plan.
respondent
carlton,
as
executpr,
purchased
shares,
sold
them
to
the
company,
and
its
plan
had
a
loss
and
claimed
a
substantial
deduction
on
the
estate
tax
return.
the
year
later
however,
the
statute
was
amended
to
provide
that
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
deduction,
his
securities
sold
must
have
been
directly
owned
by
the
decedent
immediately
before
death.
the
amendment
applied
retroactively
as
if
it
were
incorporated
in
the
original
1986
provision.
the
internal
revenue
service
disallowed
the
deduction.
the
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
in
the
ensuing
refund
action
rejecting
the
executor's
contention
of
the
retroactive
application
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals,
by
a
divided
vote,
reversed.
it
held
that
retroactive
application
here
was
harsh
and
oppressive,
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
hold
that
the
retroactive
application
did
not
violate
due
process.
to
be
sure
a
tax
statute's
retroactive
application
must
be
supported
by
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
furthered
by
rational
means.
but
here,
the
amendment
was
neither
illegitimate
nor
arbitrary.
congress
intended
the
amendment
to
correct
what
it
reasonably
viewed
as
a
mistake
in
the
original
statute.
the
retroactive
application
is
rationally
related
to
the
legitimate
purpose.
congress
acted
promptly
and
the
retroactivity
period
extended
only
slightly
longer
than
one
year.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
and
justice
scalia
also
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
is
joined
by
justice
thomas.
