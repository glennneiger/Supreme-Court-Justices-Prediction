are
there
any...
are
there
any
cases
thus
far
giving
any
real
substance
to
legitimate
government
interest?
what
if...
what
if
the
congress
came
along
and
said
our
theory
of
taxation,
based
on
the
assumptions
of
supply-side
economics
in
the
eighties,
turned
out
to
be
wrong;
we
lost
too
much
money.
so,
we
want
to
go
back...
let's
assume
they
do
it
consistently
with
the
statute
of
limitations
at
least...
we
want
to
go
back
and
refigure
the
tax
rates
for
those
years
to
recover
money.
does
that
succeed?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
there's
no
reliance
rule
ever?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
it
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
case
that
justice
ginsburg
just
put
to
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
isn't
the...
isn't
the
answer
simply
that
you
can't
seem
to
think
of...
of
an
example,
or
maybe
we
can't
seem
to
think
of
an
example
which
would
ever
run
afoul
of
the
rule.
and
the
rule
that
you're
arguing
for
really
is
that
so
long
as
congress
at
least
has
some
public
purpose
in
mind,
there's
no
limit
on
what
congress
can
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
to
say
that
the
retroactive
feature
never,
as
such,
combines
with
any
other
set
of
facts
to
invalidate
the
retroactive
exercise?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
implication
of
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
answer
to
that
is
there
are
good
reasons
not
to
adopt
a
test,
the
meaning
of
which
we
do
not
understand.
and
i
do
not
understand
the
limit
of
your
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
even...
even
with
that
pedigree,
i
still
do
not
understand.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
that
a
criterion
or
is
that
a
conclusion?
i
mean,
if
we
concluded,
for
example,
that
in
fact
there
was
no
legitimate
purpose
to
be
served,
or
there
was
no
rational
relationship
between
the
act
and
the
legitimate
purpose
the
government
claimed,
wouldn't
we,
in
effect,
embody
that
conclusion
by
saying,
yes,
it
was
unduly
harsh
and
so
on?
i'm
not
sure
that
that
gives
us
a
test,
rather
than
it...
so
much
as
it
simply
expresses
a
conclusion.
