justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
jones,
can
i
ask
you
if
at
any
stage
in
this
proceeding,
did
the
irs
take
the
position
that
because
the
whole
thing
was
too
good
to
be
true
that
it
should
not
have
been
construed
literally,
but
should
have
been
construed,
as
some
of
the
senators
said,
what
they
intended?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
my
question
was
a
simpler
one.
i
was
just
asking,
at
any
stage
in
this
litigation,
did
the
government
make
the
argument
i
just
suggested?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
you
must
have
argued
it
if
they
rejected
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
question
prompted
by
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
talks
about
procedural
due
process?
are
you
making
what
is
a
terrible
word,
a
substantive
due
process
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
between
procedural
and
substantive
due
process?
you
really
don't
know
whether
you're
making
a
substantive
due
process
argument
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
it
is
a
substantive
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allen,
you're
very
persuasive
on
all
the
pitfalls
here.
is
your...
is
your
argument
confined
to
estate
taxes,
or
do
you
make
the
same
argument,
say,
on
income
tax
on
capital
gains,
for
example?
i'm
just
thinking,
you
say
an
easy
case,
that
the
congress
decided
that
their
revenue
needs
were
such
that
they
would
charge...
tax
capital
gains
during
the
closed
years,
say
two
or
three
years
back,
at
35
percent
instead
of
25
percent.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
i
take
it,
it
would
be
under
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
assuming
no
windfall,
no
notice
of
anything,
just
the
government
needs
a
little
more
money.
but
you
don't
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
goes
back
no
more
than
two
or
three
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
see,
the
thrust
of
my
question
is,
is
the
detrimental
reliance
that
you
have
in
this
case
really
anything
different
than
the
ordinary
investor
faces
in...
in
buying
and
selling
stocks...
if
the
tax
rates
are
25
percent
on
capital
gains,
then,
two
years
later,
the
government
changes
the
rules
on
them?
it
seems
awfully
unfair,
i
can
see,
but
is
it
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it's
multiyear
in
the
sense
that
he
made
the
purchase
earlier.
but
he
makes
a
decision
to
sell
in
a
particular
year
at
a
time
when
the
capital
gains
tax
rate
is,
say,
25
percent.
then,
two
years
later,
congress
decides
we
need
revenue
and
we're
going
to
retroactively
tax
capital
gains
for
the
last
three
years
at
35
percent.
that's
the
case.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
same
as
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your...
your
client
expected
to
pay
estate
taxes,
he
just
didn't
expect
to
pay
quite
as
much...
quite
as
high
a
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
he...
he...
this
is
not
going
to
eliminate
the
tax,
it's
just
going
to
change
the
amount
of
the
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
suppose
the
closer
example
for
me
then
would
be
a
statute
in
1989
repealing
the
capital
gains
tax
entirely,
and
then,
two
years
later,
the
new
administration
comes
in
and
said,
gee,
they
made
a
mistake,
so
we're
going
to
reimpose
the
tax.
that
would
be
analogous
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
for
what
it's
worth,
i
suppose
we
shouldn't
be
offering
opinions
on
irrelevant
subjects,
but
i
certainly
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
breach
of
the
executor's
duty,
given
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
they
acted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
that's
any
part
of
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
certainly
not
if
he
wins
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
certainly
not
if
he
wins
the--
--but
even
if
he
loses
is
what
i'm
saying...
even
if
he
loses.
