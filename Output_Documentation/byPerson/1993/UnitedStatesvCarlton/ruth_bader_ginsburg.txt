justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
other
manner
to
interpret
it?
i
mean,
you
said
that
congress
made
a
mistake,
but
didn't
the
words
mean
what
they
appear
to
mean?
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
decedent
own
the
stock
at
the
time
congress
enacted
this
measure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
determine,
is
how
far
you
carry
that.
you
have
given
us
so
far
the
"too
good
to
be
true"
test.
if
you
looked
at
this
and
you
said,
oh,
my
goodness,
i'm
going
to
get
two-and-a-half
million
in
the
deduction
in
exchange
for
a
$600,000
loss...
too
good
to
be
true.
suppose,
to
take
this
very
situation,
congress
had
said,
esop's
have
had
it
good
enough,
and
we're
going
to
even
take
away
the
decedent
who
owns
this
share,
we're
going
to
take
that
away
six
months
later
and
make
that
retroactive.
and
let's...
and
we
have
the
same
constitutional
question.
the
statute
had
been
written
originally...
as
you
say,
it
should
have
been
all
along...
to
qualify
the
decedent
must
own
the
share.
two
months
into
the
new
year,
congress
decides
it's
given
away
too
much.
and
so,
that's
one
of
the
things
it's
going
to
change
retroactively.
would
there
be
a
constitutional
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
saying
trust
congress
to
be
rational
and
just.
but,
reading
your
presentation,
this
is
what
i
got
out
of
it.
and
please
correct
me
if
you
have
a
stopping
point
less
than
this.
you
seem
to
say,
deductions
are
a
matter
of
legislative
grace.
congress
can
retroactively
delete
any
deduction
it
gives
as
long
as
it
acts
promptly
to
do
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
taking
out
that
they
have
to
act
promptly
can't
be
13
years
later?
they
have
to
act
promptly;
but
they
can
be
very
clear
that
here's
a
deduction,
and
six
months
later
say,
we
gave
away
too
much
and
withdraw
that
same
deduction.
and
that's
all
right?
that
seemed
to
be
your
position,
and
i
wasn't
100
percent
sure
that
you
had
a
stopping
point
somewhere
short
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
what
it's
worth,
didn't
they
sell
below
market
even
when
they
sold?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
also
stipulated
how
much
the
estate
tax
savings
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
2.5
million?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your...
your
bottom
line
is
congress
can
withdraw
a
deduction
as
long
as
it
does
so
promptly?
that's,
i
take
it,
the
end
point--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--use,
why
don't
we
just
call
it
use
of
a
drafting
defect,
because
if
congress
had
never
changed
it,
never
required
the
shares
to
be
owned
by
the
decedent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
you're
not
trying
to
make
any
kind
of
business
purpose
test?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let
me...
let
me
understand
that
i
got
your
answer
right
to
this.
that
even
if
it
had
been
decedent's
shares
from
the
beginning,
if
that
had
been
written
into
the
law,
even
that,
congress
could
have
withdrawn
such
a
deduction
as
long
as
it
acted
promptly
to
do
so
in
the
next
tax
year?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
they
gave
you
a
2.5
million
deduction
and
then
they
took
it
away
sounds
pretty
substantive
to
me.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if...
the
$600,000
is
balanced
against...
to
the
extent
of
this...
having
your
estate
tax,
that's
a
rather...
one
of
the
questions
that
puzzled
me
is
there
was...
this
was
a
rather
large
estate,
and
yet
you
did
this
with
a
relatively
small
piece
of
it.
why
didn't
you
go
further,
given
the
opportunity
to
have
your
estate
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
had
found
a
few
more
esop's
you
could
have...
and
if
you
prevail,
you
could
have
made
that
tax
bill
very
much
lower?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
justice
scalia
asked
you
a
question
before...
i
mean,
to
get
such
an
advantage,
it
seems
that
$600,000
really
wasn't
a
whole
lot...
wasn't
a
very
large
loss.
i
was
wondering
why
there
was...
wasn't
even
more
of
a
differential
in
the
price,
considering
what
the
esop...
what
advantage
you
were
gaining
as
a
result
of
selling
to
this
esop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
given...
given
the
rather
significant
estate
tax
advantage,
do
you
disagree
with
the
characterization,
looking
at
this
provision,
this
is
too
good
to
be
true,
it's
too
good
to
last?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
too
good
to
be
true
in
the
sense
of...
of
the
tremendous
estate
tax
savings
that
was
involved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
would
have
a
rather
circumscribed
group.
this
would
be
open
to
everybody.
you
want
to
come
in
and
lower
your
estate
tax,
here's
a
great
way
to
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
disagree
that
if
had
stayed
on
the
books,
then
every
estate
that
could
would
have
tried
to
make
this
kind
of
transaction,
i
guess,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
part
of
a
measure
with...
rather,
the
long
measure
of
this
provision
came
up
in...
in
the
bill
that
had
how
much
in
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government,
in
fact,
didn't
make
that
argument.
it
said
that
any
deduction
can
be
withdrawn
as
long
as
it's
done
so
promptly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean...
are
you
making
a
distinction
between
you
did
it
simply
to
get...
to
take
advantage
of...
of
lowering
your
estate
tax
by
50
percent
to
the
extent
of
this,
and
other
people
may
have
mixed
motives;
they're
doing
it
both
to
lower
their
tax
and
for
some
other
economic
reason,
therefore
your
case
should
be
more
sympathetic?
that
seems
to
be
what
you
were
just
presenting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
other
people
have
a
business
purpose,
you
have
no
business
purpose
other
than
to
save
this
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
your
motive
is
pure,
it's
simply
to
save
tax.
somebody
who's
doing
it
for
saving
tax
plus
an
economic
motive
is
less
sympathetically
situated,
i
take
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
following
this.
the
taxpayer
said
we
did
it
to
take
advantage
of
the
tax
loophole...
call
it
whatever
you
will--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
didn't
try
to
present
any
business
purpose.
i
think
they
were
very
candid
in
saying,
unlike
some
other
people
who
had
mixed
motives,
our
motives
was
to
save
the
tax.
