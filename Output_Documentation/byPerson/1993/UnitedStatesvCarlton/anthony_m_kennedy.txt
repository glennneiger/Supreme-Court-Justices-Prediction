justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
was
the
purpose
of
limiting
this
to
stock
that
was
owned
previously,
just
before
the
death
of
the
decedent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
so,
the
thought
was
that
this
would
apply
primarily
to
stock
that
wasn't
publicly
traded?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
the
point
of
it
is
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
encourage
employee
plans
to
begin...
to
have
more
ownership
of
the
employer
company,
then
the
way
the
tax
statute
was
drafted
really
did
further
that
purpose.
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
mean,
it
furthered
it
so
much
that
the
government
began
to
be
terrified
by
the
loss
of
revenue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
if
the
government
had
been
decent
about
the
thing
in
its
retroactive
curative
legislation
it
would
have
at
least
allowed
a
credit
for
any
loss
that
had
been
taken.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
you're
saying
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
from
which
we
could
either
conclude
or
take
judicial
notice
that
most
practitioners
would
be
on
notice
that
this
statute
was
likely
to
be
amended?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
mean
amended
retroactively,
amended
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
or
in
documents
from
which
we
can
take
public
notice
that
would
indicate
that
a
member
of
the
bar
would
be
on
notice
that
this
was
likely
to
be
repealed,
and
repealed
retroactively?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
than
perhaps
our
assessment
that
it's
too
good
to
be
true?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
be
curious,
mr.
jones,
as
to
how
you
would
answer
the
question
posed
by
justice
blackmun:
do
you
think
the
executor
here
would
be
liable
for
fiduciary
breach?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let...
let
me
advise
you
that
it's
a
breach
of
due
care.
would
the
executor
have
been
unreasonable
in
taking
the
action
that
it
did
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
point
is,
is
that
it's
reasonable.
