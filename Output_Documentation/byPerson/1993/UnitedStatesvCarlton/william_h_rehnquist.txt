chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
92-1941,
the
united
states
v.
jerry
w.
carlton.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
was
a
mistake
in
interpretation
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
should
he
have
distrusted
the
result
if
that
were
a
proper
construction
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
welch...
welch
was
a
different
case
from
this.
the
court
observed,
as
i
recall,
that
the
taxpayer
would
not
have
changed
his
conduct.
nothing
different
would
have
happened.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
the
court
also
observe
the
fact
that
the
receipt
of
income
would
have
gone
on
regardless
of
what
the
statutory
provision
was?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
court
made
that
observation,
you
can
say
it's
dicta,
but
you
can
argue
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
that
observation
if
it
didn't
think
it
was
of
some
importance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
more
do
we
do
other
than
read
the...
read
the
language
that
congress
has
adopted?
do
you...
do
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
supposed
to
read
a
statute
with
the
idea
that,
this
is
a
weird
provision,
ergo,
congress
never
would
have
adopted
it?
certainly,
24
years
of
experience
here
suggest
the
opposite
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
government.
then
the
9th
circuit
reversed
it.
did
they
say...
did
they
enter
judgment
for
the
taxpayer
or
send
it
back
for
a
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the...
and
was...
did
the
stipulated
record
include
anything
about
a
sustained
loss?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
one
fairly
determine
from
that...
those
mathematics...
whether
there
was
a
loss
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
those
are...
those
are
stipulated
facts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
allen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
allen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
taking
the
concept
of
a
clerical
error
on
one
side,
that
everybody
can
see
that
congress
meant
to
write
a
law
that
said
5
percent,
and
by
mistake
10
percent
was
printed,
and
on
the
other
side,
a
mistaken
judgment
on
the
part
of
congress,
where
congress
enacts
a
tax
benefit
law
and
later
decides
this
is
just
killing
our
revenue,
do
you
think
there
is
room
for
any
kind
of
"too
good
to
be
true"
concept
in
between
those
two
concepts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
understand
justice
stevens'
question
as
being
related
to
a
multiyear
transaction.
i
thought
it
was
that
a
transaction
had
simply
been
closed
and
expected
to
be
closed
simply
on
a
calendar-year
basis,
and
then
congress
goes
back
two
or
three
calendar
years.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
wouldn't,
conceivably,
under
justice
stevens'
hypothetical.
if
the
capital
gains
tax
is
repealed,
everybody
rushes
to
realize
their
capital
gains
in
1989.
and
then,
they
learn
in
1991
that
it's
all
off.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
allen.
mr.
jones,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-1941,
united
states
against
carlton
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
