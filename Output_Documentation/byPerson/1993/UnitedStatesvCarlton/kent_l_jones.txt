mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
whether
congress
may
promptly
and
retroactively
correct
a
palpable
drafting
defect
in
tax
legislation.
respondent
is
the
executor
of
willametta
day,
who
died
in
september
1985.
one
year
after
her
death,
congress
enacted
the
900-page-long
tax
reform
act
of
1986.
one
provision
of
that
complex
act,
codified
at
section
2057
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
established
a
new
estate
tax
deduction
in
the
amount
of
one-half
of
an
estate's
sale
of
stock
to
the
corporate
issuer's
employee
stock
ownership
plan,
or
esop.
respondent
sought
to
take
advantage
of
this
new
deduction
by
purchasing
$11
million
of
the
stock
of
mci
corporation
in
december
1986,
which
was
15
months
after
mrs.
day
died.
he
sold
the
stock
two
days
later
to
the
mci
esop
at
a
somewhat
lower
price.
he
claimed
an
$11
million
estate
tax
deduction
under
section
2057...
i'm
sorry,
he
claimed
a
five-and-a-half-million
dollar
estate
tax
deduction
under
section
2057
for
half
of
the
value
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
the
claimed
deduction
resulted
in
a
two-and-a-half-million
dollar
estate
tax
savings.
now,
applied
as
respondent
did
in
this
case,
section
2057
would
permit
the
executor
of
any
estate
to
entirely
eliminate
its
estate
tax
obligation
simply
by
purchasing
and
reselling
corporate
securities
after
the
decedent's
death.
as
contemporary
financial
commentators
noted,
this
application
of
the
statute
would,
and
i
quote,
"be
the
tax
loophole
you
could
drive
a
truck
through.
"
congress
obviously
did
not
intend
in
1986
to
eliminate
the
federal
estate
tax.
but
recognizing
that
section
2057,
interpreted
in
this
manner,
could
have
that
effect,
the
internal
revenue
service
promptly
proposed
an
amendment
to
the
statute--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
concede
that
it
was
a
drafting
defect
in
the
sense
that,
as
the
retroactive
amendment
provided,
that
by
its
terms,
the
statute
should
have
been
limited
to
the
sales
of
stock
that
were
directly
owned
by
the
decedent
at
the
time
of
death.
so,
yes,
we
do
concede
that
the
statute
should
have
been
more
explicit.
the
question
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
whether
by
making
it
explicit
for
the
brief
retroactive
period
of
one
year--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
are
i
believe
three
other...
if
cases
like
this
you
are
talking
about
cases
under
section
2057...
i
believe
there
are
three
other
cases,
out
of
the
thousands
of
estate
tax
returns
that
were
filed
during
this
period,
three
other
instances
where
executors
sought
to
take
what
we
would
regard
as
this
aggressive
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
chief
justice
rehnquist,
our
position
is
not
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
take
this
tax
position.
our
position
is
that,
as
professors
bitker
and
eustis
said,
a
lawyer's
passion
for
technical
analysis
of
the
statutory
language
should
always
be
diluted
by
distrust
of
a
result
that
appears
too
good
to
be
true.
we
think
that
this
executor,
in
seeking
this
tax
windfall,
should
have
known
and
probably
did
believe
that
his
hoped-for
windfall
should
be
diluted
by
distrust
of
this
result.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
he
should
look
at
this
as...
as
the
"wall
street
journal"
article
we
cited
describes
it,
as
a
tax
maneuver.
it
might
work.
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
such
a
glaring
deficiency,
it
was
such...
it
was
a
newsworthy
goof
in
the
1986
act,
and
it
was
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
would
promptly
amend
the
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
then
you
would
be...
you
would
be
embarking--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--you
would
be
embarking
on
a
new
constitutional
approach
to
these
cases.
and
i
think
that
we
really
need
to
focus
in
on
what...
what
was
the
issue
that
congress
had
to
address,
and
what's
the
constitutional
issue
for
this
court
to
address?
the
court...
the
9th
circuit
held
that
this
briefly
retroactive
amendment
violated
the
due
process
clause.
under
the
due
process
clause,
legislation
must
not
be
arbitrary
or
capricious.
it
must
reflect
a
genuine
exercise
of
a
valid
legislative
power.
in
the
pension
benefit
and
the
general
motors
cases,
this
court
held
specifically
that
retroactive
legislation
satisfies
these
due
process
requirements
if
there
is
a...
if
the
retroactive
features
of
the
statute
are
a
rational
means
of
accomplishing
a
legitimate
government
interest.
now,
in
the
context
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that's...
that's
a
question
that
i
don't
think
that
can
be
answered
better
than
the
court
did
in
welch
v.
henry.
what
the
court
said
in
welch
v.
henry
was,
assuming
a
tax
could
go
so
far
back
to
make
that
objection
valid.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
there
are
solid
institutional
and
practical
reasons
why
that
kind
of
hypothetical
really
shouldn't
be
answered
in
the
abstract.
the
court
declined
to
do
that
in
welch,
where...
where
the
tax
was
imposed
retroactively
two
years,
a
1935
tax--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
actually,
in
welch,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
taxpayer
contended
that
he
purchased
and
held
wisconsin
dividend
stock
in
reliance
on
the
economic
inducement
of
the
deduction.
and
what
the
court
held
was
that
a
taxpayer
should
be
prepared
for
the
possibility
of
a
retroactive
change
in
the
tax
laws.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
the...
the
court
did
make
the
point
that
the
dividends
weren't
going
to
be
returned
just
because
taxes
were
owed
on
them.
but
that
doesn't
really
address
the
fact
that
what
the
court...
that
the
issue...
an
issue
in
welch
was
the
taxpayer's
claim
of
reliance
on
the
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
what
wasn't
dicta
in...
in...
clearly
in
welch
was
its
statement
that
taxpayers
must
be
prepared
for
the
possibility
of
retroactive
changes,
and
that
there
is
no
injustice
in
congress,
upon
first
learning
of
the
effect
of
the
tax,
making
a
retroactive
revision.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
is
no
prior
notice
rule,
and
there
is
no
reliance
rule,
nor
is
there
a
detrimental
reliance
rule
or
a
reasonable
reliance
rule.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it's
not
really
different
from
welch,
because
in
welch,
the
state
of
wisconsin
had
adopted
a...
an
incentive
for
ownership
of
wisconsin
corporate
stock
by
exempting
only
wisconsin
dividends
from
the
tax.
frankly,
the
constitutional
justifications
for
the
retroactive
revision
of
the...
of
section
2057
are
much
stronger
than
they
were
in
welch.
because,
in
welch,
wisconsin
had
simply
changed
its
law
because
it
decided
it
wanted
more
revenues
and
that
this
was
a
good
way
to
do
it.
in
this
case,
congress
made
the
retroactive
revision
of
a
tax
to
avoid
a
glaring
loophole
that
was
a
matter
of
some
public
discussion,
and
was
designed
to
avoid
misuse
of
public
legislation.
and
in
the
words
of
this
court's
opinion
in
heinssen
and
graham
and
goodcell,
it
was
designed
to
cure
a
defect
in
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the...
the
legislative
history
of
the
initial
act
had
described
the
fact
that
what
this
stock...
what...
what
this
provision
was
designed
to
do
was
to
allow
owners
of
businesses,
upon
their
death,
to
encourage
their
estates
to
sell
that
ownership
stock
to
the
esop,
and...
and...
so
that
it
wouldn't
go
out
into
the
public
domain.
it
was
an
opportunity
to
solidify
the...
the
closely
held
corporate
stock
into
the
esop.
now--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i...
i
think
it
would
be
overstating
the
legislative
history
to
go
into
that
type
of
detail.
i
think
that
what
this
legislative
history
reflected
was
that
this
was
where...
how
they
thought
it
would
apply.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
was
designed
to
keep
it
out
of
the
public.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
really
don't
think
anyone
could...
could
suggest
that,
in
adopting
this
provision,
congress
meant
it
to
have
its
fullest
possible
reading.
no
one
would
really
think
that
what
congress
meant
to
do
here
was
to
allow
estates
to
just
go
out
and...
and
run
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--sit
across
the
table
from
an...
from
the
esop
and
hand
stock
back
and
forth
until
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
only
reason--
[laughter]
the
only
reason
we
even
address
the
issue
of
the
reasonableness
of
reliance
is
because
the
court
of
appeals
raised
it.
this
court
has
never
raised
it.
in
welch,
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
the
statute
was
clear
on
its
face,
wisconsin
dividend
stock
is
not
subject
to
tax.
but
what
the
court
said
is,
this
is
a
constitutional
question.
and
under
the
constitution,
congress
can
do
things
that
aren't
arbitrary
and
capricious.
and
there
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
constitutional
issue.
and,
again,
what
this
court
has
said
in
several
of
these
cases
is
that
you
look
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
particular
case
to
determine
whether
the
statute,
the
amending
or
repealing
or
retroactive
statute,
was
a
rational
means
of
addressing
a
legitimate
government
problem.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
which
case?
in
the
hypothetical?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i'm...
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
tell
you
that
there
is
a
clear
answer
to
that.
in
my
view,
there
is
a
clear
answer
to
that.
in
my
view,
it
would
be
no
different
than
wisconsin
retroactively,
for
two
years,
repealing
their
dividend
exclusion
under
state
income
tax
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i...
i
think
that
so
long
as
what
is...
what
congress
has
enacted
is
either
within
the
power
to
raise
and
levy
taxes,
or
within
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
under
article
i
of
the
constitution,
that
that
resolves
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
rational
means
of
furthering
a
legitimate
public
interest.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
not
say
that,
personally.
i
don't
think--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there...
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
and
the
first
is...
is
the
one
i've
already
mentioned,
which
is
there
are
good
reasons
for
the
court
not
to
try
to
answer
that
question
in
the
abstract.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
test
that
i'm
proposing,
if
you
will,
for
the
court
to
adopt
is
a
test
that
the
court
has
adopted
in
a
string
of
maybe
20
cases
in
this
century
in
which
it
has
upheld
retroactive
tax
cases
as
not
being
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
well,
there...
there
is
a...
there
is
a
way
to
think
about
this
that
even
in
describing...
i
would
not
recommend
to
the
court
in
an
opinion
trying
to
nail
down
the
theory,
if
you
will,
on
this
subject.
but
there
is
a
way
to
think
about
this
issue,
about
the
limits
of
retroactivity.
one
way
would
be
to
say
that
the
power
that
congress
draws
upon
is
the
power
to
raise
and
levy
taxes,
and
that
a...
the
concept
of
a
tax
may
itself
have
some
substance
that
avoids
an
unduly
retroactive
result.
that
is
to
say,
there
may
be
some
type
of
contemporaneity
within
the
very
concept
of
a
tax
to
distinguish
it
from
a...
from
what
the
court
described
in...
in
unt...
rather
in
nichols...
as
a
taking.
but
there
is
no
jurisprudence
within
this
court's
decisions
on
that
subject.
and
there
is
a
good
reason
for
that.
the
good
reason,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
congress
doesn't
go
around,
willy-nilly,
doing
these
kind
of
hypothetical
things.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
certainly,
if
it
acts
promptly
to
do
so.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
darusmont
in
1982.
that's
what
it
held
in
welch
in
1938.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there...
the
court
hasn't
drawn
a
specific
stopping
point
in
terms
of
how
far
back
you
can
go.
the
longest
going
back
that
i'm
aware
of
was
the
heinssen,
where
congress
went
back
eight
years
to
impose
a
tax
on
imports
that
this
court
had
held
there
was
no
authority
under
the
preexisting
legislation.
the
court
held
that
that
was
an
appropriate
exercise.
it
wasn't
arbitrary
or
capricious;
that
it
was
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
taxing
power
to
cure
a
defect
in
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
the
heinssen
rationale
certainly
would
apply
here,
where
the
defect
was,
in
our
view,
palpable,
and
in
view
of
the...
of
public
commentators,
was
palpable
as
well.
but
perhaps
i
should
emphasize
once
more
that
i'm
not
ask...
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
decide
whether...
whether
the
taxpayer
acted
reasonably
or
not.
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
taxpayer
really
didn't
rely
whether
he
was
taking
a
gamble.
we're
simply
meeting...
meeting
head-on
their
argument
in
that
respect.
we
don't
think
that's
even
relevant
to
the
constitutional
test
that
this
court
has
carefully
in
several...
in
several
opinions,
articulated.
i
should
point
out
again,
on
an
issue
that
we
think
is
not
actually
relevant
to
the
decision,
the...
the
proposition
that
the
taxpayer
did
detrimentally
rely.
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
about
the
fact
that
this
transaction
resulted
in
a
$600,000
loss
for
the
estate.
the
tax
benefit
of
that
loss
would
be
accounted
for
on
the
estate's
income
tax
return.
it
has
no
relationship
to
the
estate
tax
return
or
to
the
deduction
under
section
2057,
which
is
calculated
simply
as
50
percent
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale,
without
regard
to
whether
there
was
a
gain
or
a
loss.
moreover,
the
loss
claimed
by
the
estate
in
this
case
resulted
primarily
from
a
two-day
holding
period
that
the
estate
employed
in
an
effort
to
breath
economic
substance
into
this
tax-motivated
transaction.
the
price
fell
somewhat
in
the
interim.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it...
well,
this
is
a
summary
judgment
case,
and
so
it's
hard
to
answer
questions
like
that.
but
the
facts
shown
in
the
record
are
that
on
the
final...
on
the
day
of
the
sale,
there
was
a
trading
range
of
i
believe
$7.12
to
$7.40.
they
sold
at
$7.05.
so,
theoretically,
there
was
a
discount.
but
there's
no...
there's
no
testimony
from
anybody
to
establish
that.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
no
broker's
commission
paid
on
this
sale.
and
so,
the
savings...
the
savings
at
issue
may
come
from
that
as
much
from
any
bargain
for
a
discount.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
they--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not
suggesting--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not
suggesting
there
might
not
have
been
some
discount.
but
there
isn't
any
evidence
here
as
to
what
the
discount
might
have
been.
there
is
evidence
that
no
commission
was
charged
on
the
sale.
but
our
point,
as
we
made
it
in...
in
the
brief,
and
which
isn't
disputed
by
respondent,
was
that
if
this
stock
had
been
purchased
only
a
couple
of
days
earlier
and
sold
on
the
same
day,
the
estate
would
have
made
an
$800,000
gain
instead
of
a
$600,000
loss.
the
claimed
deduction
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
entered
judgment
on
the...
on
the
stipulated
record.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
it
showed
the
mathematics
that...
of
what
they
paid
for
the
stock
and
what
they
got
back.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
one
can
determine
there
was
a
$631,000
loss.
our--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
sir.
our
point
is
simply
that
the...
the...
the
primary
ingredient
to
that
loss
was
that
the
market
dropped.
they
bought
at
the
top
of
the
market.
i
mean,
the
bottom--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
that's
correct.
i
mean,
our
point
is
statutes
shouldn't
be
unconstitutional
if
the
market
goes
down
and
constitutional
only
if
the
market
goes
up.
as
this
court
held
in
welch,
the
taxpayer
has
no
constitutional
entitlement
to
the
benefit
of
the
deduction
that
congress
rationally
revised.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
certain...
in
our
view,
certainly,
if
it
does
so
promptly.
i
mean,
i...
i
hate
to
keep,
if
you
will,
beating
you
with
your
prec...
your
own
precedent,
but
the
heinssen
case
did
apply
a
tax
retroactively
for
eight
years.
was
that
prompt?
well,
i
don't
think
that
promptly
is
necessarily
the
only
issue.
i
think
it's
a
complex
problem.
but
the
bottom
line,
the
constitutional
standard
that
the
court
needs
to
determine
is
whether
what
congress
did
was
rational
or,
stated
differently,
was
it
arbitrary?
well,
it
was
clearly
rational
to
try
to
avoid
a
misuse
of
this
drafting
defect.
it
wasn't
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
call
it
misuse
because,
as
applied
by
the
executor
in
this
case,
it
would
make
all
the
other
provisions
of
the
federal
estate
and
gift
tax
super...
superfluous.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
precisely
for
the
reason
that
i
think
i
just
mentioned,
and
that
was
that
it's
too
good
to
be
true
for
the...
when
the
statute
really
makes
the
whole
tax
go
away.
you
can
sit
down
across
the
table
from
the
esop
and
hand
paper
back
and
forth
all
day
long
until
you've
got
a
big
enough
deduction
so
you
don't
have
to
pay
a
tax.
there
was...
there
is
a
case...
i
mean,
that's
exaggerating
a
little
bit,
although
it's
possible
under
their
interpretation
of
the
statute.
there
is
a
case
a
little
bit
like
that
before
the
court,
the
ferman
case,
which
is
pending
on
certiorari,
where
the
executor
rotated
a
$400,000
fund
through
a
broker
until
she
got
a
big
enough
deduction
to
avoid
the
estate
tax.
that's
too
good
to
be
true.
it
was
rational
for
congress
to
say,
we
shouldn't
let
that
happen.
it
was
only
retroactive
for
a
year.
this
court
has
sustained
much
more.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we...
we
are
logically
obstructed
in
trying
to
take
that
technical
approach
under...
under
the...
under
this
court's
opinions...
from
the
two-day
holding
period.
that's
why
the
two-day
holding
period
is
there,
to
give
economic
substance
into
the
transaction.
and
it
was
during
that
two-day
holding
period
that
the
stock
went
down.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
know
that
it
was
addressed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
know
that
only
from
the
fact,
frankly,
that
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
suggestion.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
assume
so.
i
do
not,
frankly,
recall
what
was
said
on
that
in
the
district
court.
i
do
not
believe
the
district
court
addressed
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
this
is
a...
this
is
a
due
process
constitutional
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
i
think
welch
would
stand
for
that
proposition.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
the
phrase,
too
good
to
be
true,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitution
or
the
issue
that
the
court
needs
to
decide.
i
want
to
emphasize
one
more
time,
we
raise
that
point
only
in
suggesting
that
the
equitable
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
really
doesn't
hold
water.
the
constitutional
issue
that
this
court
has
clearly
articulated
is
whether
this
retroactive
amendment
is
a
rational
means
of
accomplishing
a
legitimate
purpose.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
have
to
admit
that
the
fiduciary
duties
of
executors
is
something
with
which
i
am
not
wholly
familiar.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
sure
i
could
offer
an
opinion
on
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
the
executor
took
a
calculated
risk.
i
think
it's
quite
obvious
that
this
was
a
tax-motivated
transaction,
that
he
designed
it
in
a
fashion
to
try
to
fit
within
the...
the
business
purpose
rule
of
this
court's
decisions.
whether
his
motivation--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
business
purpose
is
the
wrong
word.
they
say
they
took
an
economic
risk
in
holding
this.
they
had
a
two-day
holding
period
for
the
stock.
if
they
hadn't
had
that,
they
wouldn't
have
even
gotten
past
the
gregory
v.
helvering
business
purpose
or
economic
substance
standard.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
record
certainly
doesn't
tell
us.
the
executor
is...
is
here,
mr.
carlton,
he's
a
member
of
the
law
firm
that...
that
is
before
the
court
today.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i...
my--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
not
my
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't...
i
certainly
wouldn't
dispute
that.
in
fact,
i
tried
to
make
the
point
earlier
that
we
didn't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
didn't
think
that
he
was
acting
unreasonably,
we
just--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--thank
you.
