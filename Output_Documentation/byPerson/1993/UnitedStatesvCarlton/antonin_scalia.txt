but
they...
they
were
talking
about
taxpayers
generally,
and
not
taxpayers...
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
something
quite
different
about
a
provision
that
is
written
as
an
incentive
to
induce
taxpayers
to
do
something
that
is
against
their
economic
interest;
namely,
in
these
cases,
to
sell
stock
to
these
employee
stock
ownership
plans,
which
will
be
sold
at
less
than
what
you
could
get
elsewhere,
obviously,
because
the
plan
knows
that
it's...
it's
buying
it
from
someone
who
has
a
real
incentive
to
sell
it
to
them.
now,
you
dangle
this
in
front
of
the
taxpayer
and
say,
take
a
loss
in
order
to
get
the
tax
benefit.
and
then,
later,
you
take
away
the
tax
benefit.
the
possibilities
are
wonderful
for
achieving
all
sorts
of
governmental
program.
that's
quite
different
from
any
of
these
other
cases
i
think.

if
they
didn't
sell
below
market,
i
guess
the
market
doesn't
work
the
way
everybody
thinks
it
works.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
cannot
imagine
a
deal
between
somebody
who
knows
that
he
gets
a
big
tax
benefit
if
he...
if
he
sells
it
to
a
particular
buyer,
and
that
buyer
knows
that
the
seller
gets
a
particular
tax
benefit,
and
the
buyer
comes
in
and
says,
hey,
i'll
give
you
a
market.
justice
antonin
scalia
human
beings
just
don't
operate
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
--incidentally,
why
isn't
this
statute
too
good
to
be
true
even
if
you
read
it
as
later
amended?
why
isn't
it
too
good
to
be
true
for
the...
for
the...
for
the
employer
who
dies
with
a
closely
held
stock?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
like
a
pretty
bad
process,
too.
[laughter]
would
the
government's
case
be
any
stronger...
could
it
have
been
strengthened
by
any
different
legislative
procedure?
if
they
had
more
hearings
and
had
a
lot
more
witnesses
and
three
or
four
votes
to
be
sure
they
got
it
right,
would
that
make
it
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
allen,
the...
whether
this
is
substantive
due
process
or
procedural
due
process,
either
way,
you're
saying
that
there
is
something
that's
under
the
due
process
clause,
which
rather
duplicates
what's
in
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
now,
we
have
another
provision
in
the
constitution
that
prevents
ex
post
facto
laws.
that's
been
interpreted
to
apply
only
to
criminal
and
penal
laws.
wouldn't
you
think
that
if
there
was
a
guarantee
against
retroactivity
generally
it
would
have
been...
would
have
been
put
in
that
provision
rather
than
in...
it
seems
to
me,
you
know,
inclusio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius,
since
we
only
prohibit
criminal
and
penal
ex
post
facto,
the
implication
is
that
retroactive
laws
or
whatever
else
they
may
be,
are
not
unconstitutional.
and
there
were...
there
were
state...
state
constitutional
provisions.
we
had
one
in
a
case
before
us
a
few
weeks
ago,
that
did
pro...
prohibit
retrospective
legislation
generally,
but
we
chose
not
to
do
that
in
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what...
what
you
say...
what
you
say
about...
about
evaluating
the
harshness
and
oppressiveness
leads
me
to
believe
that
you
think
this
statute
may
be
invalid
as
to
some
taxpayers
and
valid
as
to
others,
depending
upon
how
harshly
and
oppressively
its
impact
is
felt.
is
that
a
fair
characterization
of
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
say
$600,000
is
harsh
and
oppressive?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
sharing
80/20
means
sharing
what,
the
tax
benefits
80/20?
