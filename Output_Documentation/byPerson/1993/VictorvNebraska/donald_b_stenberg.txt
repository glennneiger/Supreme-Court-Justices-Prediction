mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
victor's
arguments
underscore
the
problems
created
for
the
states
by
the
cage
decision.
defendant's
counsel
will
pick
five
or
six
words
from
a
jury
instruction
and
argue
that
those
five
or
six
words
invalidates
the
entire
instruction.
this
is
like
a
doctor
who
operates
on
a
patient
and
upon
opening
the
patient
up
sees
a
perfectly
healthy
and
normal
appendix,
reaches
in,
cuts
the
appendix
in
half,
and
has
now
found
a
defective
appendix.
we
must
look
at
the
entire
instruction
and
not
simply
pick
out
pieces
that
have
been
cut
out
from
the
whole.
taken
as
a
whole,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
nebraska's
reasonable
doubt
jury
instruction.
this
jury
instruction
was
written
by
a
distinguished
committee
of
nebraska
lawyers,
judges,
and
professors.
two
of
the
members
of
the
committee
that
wrote
the
nebraska
jury
instruction
in
1965
are
now
on
the
u.s.
district
court
bench
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
this
is
an
extremely
good
faith
effort
by
the
state
of
nebraska,
under
the
direction
of
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
to
explain
a
concept
that
admittedly
is
hard
to
explain
and
yet
is
a
very
important
one.
i
should
point
out
that
this
instruction
is
more
widely
used
in
nebraska
than
petitioner
suggests.
indeed,
that
is
illustrated
by
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner.
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
on
december
17th,
1993,
decided
the
cook
case.
the
cook
case
was
a
crime
committed
in
february
of
1992
and
tried
sometime
later
that
year.
the
same
instruction
was
used
there
that
is
before
this
court
today,
and
that
case
came
out
of
douglas
county,
our
state's
most
populous
county.
under
our
current
nebraska
supreme
court
rule,
a
trial
judge
may
use
either
the
old
instruction
which
is
before
this
court
today,
or
the
newer
one.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
the
new
one
leaves
out
all
of
the
three
phrases
that
are
questioned
here,
your
honor.
however,
that
has
not
protected
it
from
assault
by
the
defense
bar.
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
already
had
to
address
the
constitutionality
of
our
new
reasonable
doubt
jury
instruction
under
the
cage
analysis,
despite
the
fact
that
it
does
not
contain
any
of
the
words
used
in
the
cage
instruction.
there
are
substantial
precedents
supporting
the
committee's
work
in
writing
this
jury
instruction.
indeed,
at
the
time
cage
was
decided,
at
least
by
our
count
there
were
28
states
that
used
one
or
more
of
the
phrases
that
were
questioned
in
cage:
23
states
used
the
term,
moral
certainty,
in
the
jury
instruction,
and
16
other
states,
including
nebraska,
used
the
term,
substantial
doubt.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
widespread
retroactive
invalidation
of
all
of
these
jury
instructions
would
create
enormous
difficulties
in
the
administration
of
justice
over
half
of
the
states,
or
nearly
half
of
the
states
of
this
united
states.
states
would
be
required
to
go
back
and
retry
several
years,
perhaps
5
years
or
10
years,
depending
how
far
we
take
retroactivity,
of
criminal
jury
trials.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
i
would
say...
i
guess
i
would
use
the
term,
at
least,
your
honor,
because
as
i
pointed
out,
even
our
new
instructions
which
contains
none
of
the
phrases
that
were
commented
upon
in
cage,
has
been
challenged.
i
don't
know
where,
if
the
nebraska
and
california
instructions
are
invalidated
by
this
court,
where
the
line
will
stop,
and
that's
why
i
would
suggest
the
word...
suggest
that
at
least
16
or
23
or
28
states
would
be
directly
affected,
and
possibly
more.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
your
honor,
let's
start
at
least
by
looking
at
the
victor
case
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
victor
committed
his
crime
in
1987.
his
trial
was
held
in
1988,
and
here
we
are
in
1994,
6
years
later.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
i
think
on
the
record
here
it's
a
little
unclear
as
to
whether
we're
on
direct
review
or
not,
your
honor,
but
i
would
note
that
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief...
petitioner
victor
in
his
reply
brief
argues
that
even
under
the
teague
standard,
because
this
is
so
fundamental,
because
the
reasonable
doubt
jury
instruction
is
so
fundamental,
it
is
part
of
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
that
if
the
instruction
is
invalid,
that
we
would
have
to
go
back
under
a
teague
test
as
well,
and
that,
of
course,
is
not
the
position
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
i
guess
my
response,
your
honor,
would
be
that
there's
no
question
that
we're
looking
at
several...
that
obviously
retroactivity
affects
exactly
how
many
cases
are
affected,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
we're
looking
at
several
years'
worth
of
retrials
if
these
jury
instructions
are
broadly
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i
think
since
cage
there
has
been
a
pretty
general...
it's
been
a
fairly
standard
objection
to
object
to
reasonable
doubt
jury
instructions,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
that,
of
course,
is
exactly
the
argument
we
make
on
retroactivity
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
turning,
i
guess,
to
some
of
the
phrases,
and
i
remind
myself
as
i
do
this
that
we're
not
supposed
to
do
this...
we're
not
supposed
to
look
at
these
in
isolation,
but
i
guess
there's
no
other
way
to
talk
about
it.
now,
i'll
start
with
the
term,
substantial
doubt.
like
many
words
in
the
english
language,
substantial
has
more
than
one
meaning.
substantial
certainly
can
mean
a
large
amount
of
something,
such
as
"the
rich
woman
has
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
"
but
substantial
has
other
meanings
as
well.
for
example,
a
nebraskan
might
say,
"my
great-grandfather
and
grandmother
homesteaded
nebraska
and
they
built
a
small,
one-room
sod
house,
but
it
was
a
substantial
structure
able
to
withstand
the
strong
winds
of
the
prairies.
"
so
substantial
has
more
than
one
meaning.
it
can
mean
something
solid,
and
in
fact,
to
turn
to
our
dictionary,
webster's
third
international
dictionary
defines
substantial
as
"consisting
of
or
constituting
substance,
not
seeming
or
imaginative,
not
illusive.
"
and
it
is
that
meaning
which
is
used
in
the
nebraska
jury
instruction,
and
if
we
look
at
the
entire
sentence
in
which
the
term,
substantial
doubt,
is
used
in
our
instruction,
it
is
clear
that
that
is
what
is
meant.
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
11,
that
part
of
the
instruction
reads
as
follows:
"a
reasonable
doubt
is
an
actual
and
substantial
doubt
reasonably
arising
from
the
evidence,
from
the
facts
or
circumstances
shown
by
the
evidence,
or
from
the
lack
of
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
state,
as
distinguished
from
a
doubt
arising
from
mere
possibility,
from
bare
imagination,
or
from
fanciful
conjecture.
"
so
substantial
doesn't
always
mean
a
large
quantity.
it
can
mean,
solid,
something
that
is
not
simply
imaginary,
and
that
is
the
way
it
is
used
in
the
nebraska
jury
instruction,
and
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
context.
strong
probabilities
language
is
also
objected
to,
and
i
think
a
mere
reading
of
the
sentence
in
which
that
language
appears
answers
the
objection.
that
sentence
reads
as
follows:
"you
may
find
the
accused
guilty
upon
the
strong
probabilities
of
the
case,
provided
such
probabilities
are
strong
enough
to
exclude
any
doubt
of
his
guilt
that
is
reasonable.
"
substantially
the
same
language
was
specifically
upheld
in
this
court...
by
this
court
in
1895
in
the
dunbar
case.
finally,
we
turn
to
the
moral
certainty
language,
and
the
california
attorney
general
i
know
will
discuss
this
in
greater
detail
so
i
will
try
and
be
reasonably
brief
on
the
subject.
first
of
all,
i
would
note
that
unlike
the
moral
certainty
language
in
cage,
the
nebraska
jury
instruction
specifically
ties
the
moral
certainty
that
the
juror
must
feel
to
the
evidence
in
the
case.
this
sentence
reads
as
follows:
"it
is
such
a
doubt
as
will
not
permit
you,
after
full,
fair,
and
impartial
consideration
of
all
the
evidence,
to
have
an
abiding
conviction
to
a
moral
certainty
of
the
guilt
of
the
accused.
"
so
nebraska
carefully
ties
the
moral
certainty,
the
fact
that
moral
certainty
must
be
felt
as
a
result
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
case.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
this
court
has
long
approved
the
moral
certainty
language.
going
back
to
1880,
the
miles
case,
perovich,
wilson,
and
another
case
cited
in
our
brief.
the
state
of
nebraska
and
23
other
states
have
in
good
faith
relied
upon
those
holdings
of
this
court,
and
it
certainly
would
be
a
great
disservice
to
those
states
to
now
invalidate
carefully
written
instructions
based
on
this
court's
own
sentences,
and
certainly
that
should
not
be
done
for
any
light
reason,
and
great
deference
should
be
given
to
the
states
in
their
decision
to
employ
this
language.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i...
it
was
hinted
at
earlier
here,
i
think.
i
think
of
the
juries
of
the
frontier
state
of
nebraska
in
the
1870's,
1880's,
and
1890's.
most
of
them
were
illiterate.
if
they
had
been
to
a
couple
of
grades,
they'd
done
well.
if
they'd
been
to
eighth
grade,
they
were
considered
pretty
well-educated.
i
don't
think
that
the
meaning
to
the
common
state
of
nebraska
has...
of
moral
certainty
has
changed
over
the
years.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
your
honor,
i
do
not
profess
to
be
an
expert
on
dictionaries.
the
petitioner
says
so,
but
i
think
there
is
contemporary
understanding
also
of
what
moral
certainty
means.
let
us
say...
if
we
say,
for
example,
that
the
woman
who
was
strongly
pro-life
was
morally
certain
that
abortion
was
wrong,
morally
certain
as
used
in
that
context
means
that
she
was
as
sure
as
she
could
possibly
be,
and
i
think
that's
how
we
use
moral
certainty
in
our
jury
instruction.
the
juror
has
to
be
as
sure
as
the
juror
can
possibly
be,
and
i
would
submit
that
if
anything
that
is
a
higher
standard
than
the
law
requires,
because
arguably
that
is
higher
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
is
beyond
all
doubt.
unless
the
court
has
questions
on
the
retroactivity
issue--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--the
quote
i
have
from
the
miles
case,
your
honor,
is
found
at
page
309
in
103
u.s.,
and
the
quote
as
i
have
it
written
here,
is
"proof
beyond
a
reasonable"...
this
is
from
the
instruction,
your
honor.
"proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
such
as
will
produce
an
abiding
conviction
in
the
mind
to
a
moral
certainty
that
the
fact
exists
that
is
claimed
to
exist,
so
that
you
feel
certain
it
does.
"
the
court
then
approved
this
language,
saying,
"the
language
used
in
this
case,
however,
was
certainly
very
favorable
to
the
accused,
and
is
sustained
by
respectable
authority.
"
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
if
the
court
wishes,
i
would
address
the
retroactivity
issue.
otherwise,
i
believe
i
have
completed
my
argument.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
thank
you.
