mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
mr.
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
california
has
an
instruction
on
reasonable
doubt
which
has
in
a
sense
stood
the
test
of
time
in
california.
it
had
its
genesis
in
the
webster
case
from
massachusetts,
first
appearing,
perhaps,
in
the
california
supreme
court
reports
in
1860
when
it
commented
favorably
on
that,
continuing
to
impress
it
into
statute
form,
and
in
1927,
the
legislature,
believing
this
instruction
to
be
effective
and
to
be
accurate,
further
enacted
legislation
which
said
that
if
you
give
this
instruction
in
a
criminal
case,
no
other
instruction
on
reasonable
doubt
need
be
given,
up
to
the
present
time,
including
the
study
that
justice
scalia
mentioned
a
moment
ago
concerning
caljic,
our
committee
which
reviews
jury
instructions
and
comes
up
with
standardized
jury
instructions.
while
there
is
no
empirical
evidence
before
this
court
as
to
how
a
particular
juror
understands
this
instruction,
the
best
thing
that
i
can
direct
you
to
is
the
review
done
by
the
caljic
committee
in
1987
pursuant
to
a
request
by
the
legislature
to
look
at
this
instruction
and
to
judge
whether
or
not
we
should
maintain
that
instruction,
give
no
instruction
whatsoever,
or
give
another
instruction.
the
committee
was
made
up
of
both
prosecutors
and
defense
counsel
and
judges,
including
a
federal
appellate
justice,
and
the
consensus
at
that
time
was
that
no
change
ought
to
be
made,
and
of
the
minority
report...
a
small
minority,
but
in
the
minority
report
there
was
no
consensus
as
what
ought
to
be
done
in
its
place.
and
the
reason
i
bring
this
up
is
that
we
all
agree
there
can
be
no
perfect
way
of
defining
reasonable
doubt,
i
think,
and
yet
when
one
would
suggest
that
we
need
a
definition
other
than
that
given
in
california
for
over
100
years,
i
would
state
that
they
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
their
particular
answer
is
better
than
what
we
have
in
the
sense
that
it
will
not
have
some
of
the
same
challenges
that
admittedly
any
imperfect
instruction
would
have.
counsel
for
sandoval
stated
it
very
well.
there
is
no
one
true
definition
of
reasonable
doubt.
this
court
has
never
found
that
there
was
one
true
definition
of
reasonable
doubt.
this
court
has
never
stated
that
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
that
it
be
defined,
or
has
prescribed
its
description.
rather,
this
court,
by
not
prescribing
or
requiring,
has
allowed
the
states
to
utilize
their
best
judgment
as
long
as
they
meet
the
standard
of
reasonable
doubt,
or
unreasonable
doubt...
or
reasonable
doubt
has
been
suggested
constitutionally
in
the
context
of
the
due
process
clause,
and
i
would
suggest
that
we
might
look
at
in
re
winship
to
see
what,
in
fact,
this
court
believed
what
was
so
essential
to
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
instruction
or
concept
that
it
was
incorporated
into
our
belief
of
due
process.
in
re
winship,
in
quoting
davis,
a
previous
u.s.
supreme
court
case,
said
that
no
man
should
be
deprived
of
life
under
the
forums
of
law
unless
the
jurors
are
able
upon
their
consciences
to
say
that
the
evidence
before
them
is
sufficient
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
existence
of
every
fact
necessary
to
constitute
the
crime
charged.
the
essential
connection
there
is
that
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
protects
the
defendant
and
enforces
or
reinforces
the
obligation
or
burden
on
the
state
for
proof,
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
of
one's
guilt.
further,
referring
to
in
re
winship
on
page
364,
the
court
referred
to
two...
i
would
say
two
definitions
that
i
find
virtually
synonymous
with
moral
certainty.
that
is,
they
talked
about
the
subjective
state
of
certitude,
and
they
also
spoke
of
the
utmost
certainty.
i
believe
that
if
you
interjected
those
words
into,
to
a
moral
certainty,
found
in
the
california
instruction,
they
would
mean
virtually
the
same
thing.
at
least
there
is
no
constitutionally
significant
difference
between
the
expressions
used
by
this
court
in
in
re
winship
and
the
moral
certainty
used
in
the
instruction
in
california.
i
believe
that
the
petitioner
mistakes
time-worn
for
time-honored.
in
fact,
this
instruction
has
stood
the
test
of
time
in
california.
we
admit
it
is
not
the
perfect
instruction,
because
there
is
no
perfect
instruction.
it
is
important
that
we
look
at
any
instruction,
obviously,
as
the
standard
requires
us
to
do,
in
its
total
context.
boyde
said
that
we
could
not
judge
any
instruction
in
artificial
isolation,
and
if
you
break
down
what
to
a
moral
certainty
means
in
the
context
of
this
instruction,
it
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
present
its
case
and
carry
its
burden.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
most
reasonable,
the
most
likely
reading
of
it,
is
to
say
that
it
enhances
and
reinforces
the
obligation
of
the
fact-finder.
it,
in
a
very
real
sense,
tells
them
that
they
are
to
go
about
their
task
of
finding
facts
and
then
applying
the
law
in
a
serious-minded
fashion,
much
as
in
re
winship
suggested
that
jurors
must
be
able
to
say,
upon
their
consciences.
that's
not
to
say,
religious
beliefs.
that
means,
to
be
true
to
themselves.
that
means,
to
make
a
judgment
that
they
can
live
with.
it
reinforces
the
concept
of
abiding,
long-lasting.
on
the
contrary,
petitioner
suggests
that
you
take
a
definition
of
moral
certainty
which
is
contrary
to
the
sense
of
certainty
itself,
and
if
you
would
accept
or
adopt
petitioner's
definitions,
you
would
get
to
some
strange
sort
of
senses,
that
i
have
a
lastingly
and
abiding
sense
that
perhaps,
maybe,
something
might
be
true.
that
just
falls
on
its
face
when
you
put
it
into
context.
mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
some
have
suggested
that
it
is
better
not
to
have
any
instruction
whatsoever,
and
to
just
say,
reasonable
doubt,
and
to
say
unreasonable
doubt
is
that
doubt
which
is
not
reasonable,
and
leave
it
at
that,
yet
we
have
found
that
in
california,
at
least,
we
have
those
who
inquire
as
to
that.
mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
that
is
not
meant
as
a
criticism
on
our
part.
it
is
to
suggest,
however,
that
there
are
many
constitutionally
valid
definitions
of
reasonable
doubt,
and
that's
what
we're
about
here,
to
determine
what
is
constitutionally
required,
if
there
is
one.
in
california,
we
have
believed
that
it
is
more
effective
to
frame
it
in
the
manner
that
we
have,
making
sure
that
we
don't
run
afoul
of
the
problems
articulated
in
cage,
chief
of
which
i
believe,
at
least
concerning
the
phrase,
reasonable
doubt,
was
somehow
it
lacked
what
i
would
call
an
evidence
connection.
the
reference
to
moral
certainty
in
our
instruction
is
always
in
the
background
of
evidence.
that
is,
it
goes,
reasonable
doubt
is
that
state
of
the
case
which,
after
the
entire
comparison
and
consideration
of
all
the
evidence,
leaves
the
minds
of
the
jurors
in
that
condition
that
they
cannot
say
they
feel
an
abiding
conviction
to
a
moral
certainty
of
the
truth
of
the
charge.
consistently
throughout
the
instructions
given
in
california,
jurors
are
directed
to
evidence.
there
is
no
problem,
as
was
suggested
in
cage,
that
somehow
they
would
believe
that
they
should
have
something
other
than
evidence,
that
somehow
this
meant
that
this
was
to
be
put
in
the
place
of
evidence.
this
modifies
the
abiding
conviction.
this
talks
about
the
manner
of
reaching,
the
manner
about
which...
the
seriousness
about
which
you
go
about
your
business,
but
it
does
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
quantum
of
proof
obligated
to
the
prosecution
under
the
constitution.
the
california
instruction
does
not
have
the
other
great
impediment
found
by
this
court
in
cage,
and
that
is
to
somehow
create
a
equivalent
or
substitute
definition,
an
unadorned,
equivalent
or
substitute
definition
that
is
misleading,
that
being
primarily,
in
cage,
grave
uncertainty.
a
grave
uncertainty
in
cage
implicates
to
the
juror
that
that
manner,
that
amount
of
doubt
necessary
to
acquit,
is
more
than
what
is
constitutionally
permissible,
or
in
many
ways...
you
can
look
at
it
either
from
that
standpoint
or
say,
by
virtue
of
so
changing
the
amount
of
doubt
necessary
to
acquit,
you
basically
have
shifted
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
state
to
the
defendant,
and
obviously
that
is...
does
not
meet
constitutional
standard
in
any
regard.
at
the
very
least
we
can
say
that
cage
thereby
exaggerated
or
overstated
the
doubt
necessary
to
acquit.
there
is
no
problem
like
that
in
the
california
instruction
whatsoever.
there
is
no...
as
our
california
supreme
court
said
in
viewing
this
in
people
v.
jennings,
there
is
no
transformation
of
true,
reasonable
doubt
as
it
has
been
traditionally
defined
into
a
higher
degree
of
doubt.
we
also
do
not
have
the
words,
actual
or
substantial,
although
i
think
the
real
problem
in
cage
is
the
context
in
which
actual,
substantial
were
found,
and
again
it
gave
an
equivalency,
a
rough
equivalency
to
the
notion
of
reasonable
doubt,
unadorned
whatsoever.
lastly,
i
would
say
with
respect
to
our
difference
between
the
california
instruction
and
cage,
that
moral
certainty,
the
position
of
the
expression
moral
certainty
in
the
cage
instruction
was
devoid
of
any
reference
to
evidence.
it
was
an
awkward
appendage
hanging
out
there
that
was
susceptible
to
misinterpretation
because
of
the
context
in
which
it
found,
and
just
as
this
court
has
suggested,
that
we
need
to
look
at
the
entire
instruction
and
then
the
instruction
in
the
context
of
all
of
the
instructions,
we
need
to
look
at
moral
certainty
as
it
applies
throughout.
with
respect
to
the
dictionary
definitions,
whether
there's
been
a
change
in
definitions,
i
think
we
would
have
to
agree
that
there
has
been
in
some
change
in
definition,
but
petitioner
has
been
somewhat
selective
in
his
choice
of
definitions.
in
a
number
of
his
definitions
that
he
quoted
one
of
the
definitions
given
is
virtual.
would
virtual
be...
virtual
certainty
be
unconstitutional?
mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
it
could
if
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
instruction.
i
think
that's
very
important.
mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
that
the
word,
hold,
means
many
different
things.
we
say,
those
of
us
in
the
law,
the
court
held
something.
i
don't
go
home
and
say
to
my
children,
we
hold
you
children
have
violated
the
rules
of
the
house
and
therefore
you're
not
getting
an
allowance
this
week
and,
certainly,
having
been
through
four
knee
surgeries,
i
can
tell
you
in
football
holding
is
not
considered
something
positive.
it
depends
on
the
context
in
which
it's
placed,
and
i
think
it
is
possible,
certainly,
that
a
term
could
change
so
much
so
that
there
is
a
sole
notion
of
the
term,
so
even
placed
in
the
context
into
which
it
had
previously
been
appropriate,
would
be
inappropriate,
but
we
are
not
here--
mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
--if
you're
asking
my
view
as
a
practitioner,
i
would
tell
you
that
i
think
more
prosecutors
would
accept
that
than
more
defense
counsel.
mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
we
have
made
reference
in
our
brief
to
defense
manuals
that
specifically
instruct
defense
attorneys
in
criminal
trials
to
argue
to
the
point
of
moral
certainty,
because
it
assists
them.
it
helps
them.
mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
it,
and
if
you
look
at
the
way
it
has
been
used
by
this
court
in
many
references
where
it
was
not
reviewing
a
question
of
instruction
but
the
court
attempting
to
express
how
it
saw
something
being
seriously...
a
dissent
by
the
chief
justice
in
schnebel...
talking
about
moral
certainty
didn't
go
to
the
question
of
moral
certainty,
but
it
advanced
the
cause
that
the
decision
made
was
a
decision
that
was
made
seriously,
and
with
the
quantum
of
proof
necessary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
we've
not
seen
the
same
sort
of
expression
of
interest
in
that
phrase,
and
frankly,
i
believe
you
pick
up
the
sense
of
that
phrase
in
its
proper
sense
in
the
context
of
the
sentence
itself,
because
it
refers
to
those
things
of
human
affairs,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
difficulty
in
them
understanding
it.
frankly,
i
don't
think
most
people
go
around
talking
about
moral
evidence,
and
they're
probably
confronted
with
it
for
the
very
first
time
as
jurors,
and
the
question
then
is
the
dictionary...
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
think
the
dictionary
the
jurors
use
are
the
instructions,
and
the
question
is,
do
these
phrases
that
petitioner
suggests
are
somehow
inadequate,
so
inadequate
that
they
rise
to
a
constitutional
challenge?
do
they
in
fact
mislead
the
juror?
the
standard
is,
is
there
any
likelihood
they
mislead
the
juror,
and
i
would
believe
that
as
you
review
those,
they
don't.
if
anything,
the
sense
of
moral
certainty
reinforces...
it
adorns
the
obligation
that
someone
has.
is
it
essential?
perhaps
not,
but
i
would
suggest
there
are
many
things
in
the
legal
system
that
are
not
essential,
but
we
believe
they
assist
in
doing
our
job.
i
think
this
adds
to
the
solemnity
of
the
obligation
of
the
jurors,
much
like,
when
we
come
into
a
courtroom,
judges
and
justices
wear
robes.
that's
not
essential
to
decision-making,
but
it
adds
to
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion.
i
believe
the
phrase,
to
a
moral
certainty,
adds
to
the
solemnity
of
the
obligation
of
the
jurors,
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
understand
how
someone
would
come
in
and
believe
it
does
otherwise.
if
there
are
any
questions--
mr.
daniel
e.
lungren
--i
would
also
say
it
is
important,
and
i
believe
it
is
important,
that
the
california
committee
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
standardized
instructions
continues
to
review
these
and
other
instructions
on
a
regular
basis,
as
they
do,
so
that
we
in
fact
can
have
the
least
amount
of
difficulty
with
instructions
before
our
jurors.
thank
you.
