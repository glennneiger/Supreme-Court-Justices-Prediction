are
the
dictionary
definitions
different?
you
gave
us
a
lot
of
contemporaneous
definitions.
what
about
in
the
1850's,
what
did
the
dictionaries
say?
did
they
say
something
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
in
so
many
model
instructions
the
term
appears
well
past
the
turn
of
the
century.
justice
ruth
bader

would
it
have
been
all
right
for
the
judge
simply
to
have
refused
to
charge,
as
i
take
it
in
some
jurisdictions
that's
done?
would
that
have
met
the
constitutional
requirements?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
definition
that's
satisfactory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
newer
one
leaves
out
moral
certainty?
what
is
the
new
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about,
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
proof
that
leaves
you
firmly
convinced
of
the
defendant's
guilt,
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
ask
about
this
particular
instruction,
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
proof
that
leaves
you
firmly
convinced
of
defendant's
guilt,
because
it
is
the
one
that
the
federal
judicial
center
recommends
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
in
all
of
the
definitions
in
all
of
these
briefs
that
it
wasn't
mentioned.
