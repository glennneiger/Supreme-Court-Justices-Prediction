we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
92-8894,
clarence
victor

alfred

mr.
weber.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
why...
ordinarily
we
say
instructions
should
be
considered
as
a
whole.
why
do
you
feel
you
should
break
this
down
into
two
parts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
you
do
agree
that
this
instruction
should
be
read
as
a
whole.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
you
think
that
our
decision
in
holland
v.
united
states
lays
down
the
same
standard
as
was
laid
down
in
cage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
mean
the
standard
as
to
the
context
of
the
instruction.
maybe
you
can't
separate
them,
but
boyde
dealt
with
reasonable
understandings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
other
than
that,
do
you
think
that
holland
and
cage
lay
down
the
same
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
there
be
a
new
test
in
interpreting
an
instruction
on
reasonable
doubt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
why
does
it
follow
from
that
that
a
different
standard
should
be
applied
to
judging
a
jury
instruction
on
that
subject
than
a
jury
instruction
on
some
other
subject.
have
we
ever
suggested
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
instruction
in
this
case
routinely
given
before
our
decision
in
cage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what
line
of
reasoning
would
say
that
moral
certainty
means
roughly
like
the
civil
preponderance
standard?
is
that
what
you're
saying
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
you
say
that
because
of
the
juxtaposition
of
moral
certainty
and
strong
probabilities
that
that
gives
meaning
to
moral
certainty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
inordinately.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
weber.
mr.
milthaup.
is
it
multhaup,
or
milthaup?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
multhaup.
mr.
multhaup.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you
would
say
at
the
time
of
shaw
it
was
not
corrective
at
all,
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
average
juror
at
the
time
of
shaw
understood
what
moral
certainty
meant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
really
think
that,
do
you?
it
was
a
technical
term
even
then,
wasn't
it?
wasn't
it
a
term
of
moral
philosophy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
people...
what
percent
of
the
general
public
do
you
think
frequently
use
the
phrase,
moral
certainty,
in
their
conversation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
didn't
ask
you
whether
that
was
the
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
you
what
percent
you
thought
used
the
expression.
you're
perfectly
entitled
to
say
you
don't
know.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
familiar
to
the
readers
of
the
washington
post
and
the
new
york
times
and
the
sacramento
beat,
but
you're
not
required
to
read
those
newspapers
to
get
on
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
multhaup,
in
our
opinion
in
holland,
justice
clarke's
opinion
gives
strong
support
to
the
idea
that
you're
better
off
not
defining
reasonable
doubt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
notwithstanding
the
observations
in
holland
that
violate
the
constitution
if
a
judge
refuse
to
give
an
elaboration
on
the
meaning
of
the
term,
reasonable
doubt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
to
say
you
would
argue--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--on
behalf
of
a
client,
i'm
sure
you
would,
but
do
you
think
that's
what
the
law
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
multhaup.
general
stenberg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say,
half,
general
stenberg?
do
the
other
half
of
the
states
use
instructions
that
would
not
be
faulted
under
cage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
stenberg,
you
refer
to
our
decision
in
the
miles
case.
as
i
read
that
case,
that
does
not
set
out
the
instruction
that
was
given,
at
least
in
the
court's
opinion.
do
you...
have
you
gone
back
and
read
xx
instruction
in
the
lower
court
before
it,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
quite
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
stenberg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
lungren,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
lungren.
mr.
weber,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weber.
the
case
is
submitted.
