but
might
that
manner
be
favorable
to
the
defendants,
and
might
it
not
be
that
the
defendants'
desire
to
have
it
explains
how
it
continues
to
persist,
despite
what
you
see
the
shift
in
definitions
after
1900?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
what
the
defense
attorneys
are
doing,
but
they're
still
asking
for
moral
certainty
language.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
didn't...
didn't
california
just
make
a
decision
to
preserve
that
language
after
a
rather
extensive
review
of
the
instruction?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we're
not
on
direct
review.
i
mean,
his
direct
review
was
completed
in
1990,
wasn't
it,
when
this
court
denied
cert?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
did,
it's
because
that
was
the
law
before...
i
mean,
you
don't...
it
seems
to
me
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
issue.
if
somebody
raises
the
teague
problem,
isn't
the
answer
to
that
that
the
law
as
announced
in
cage
had
been
announced
prior
to
the
exhaustion
of
direct
review
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
prior
to
cage,
at
least
with
respect
to
cases
prior
to
cage
in
which
there
were
not
objections,
for
example,
as
i
understand
it
we
don't
know
and
we
couldn't
possibly
tell
on
this
record
whether
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
will
find
a
complete
procedural
bar.
they
simply
skipped
over
that
issue
because
they
thought
it
was
easier
to
decide
it
on
the
merits,
but
if
we
reverse
on
the
merits,
that
tells
you
nothing
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
existence
of
procedural
bars
with
respect,
for
example,
to
those
who
may
not
have
been
objecting.
