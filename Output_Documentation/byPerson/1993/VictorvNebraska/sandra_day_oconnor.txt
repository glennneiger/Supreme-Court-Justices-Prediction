well,
counsel,
that
would,
if
it
stood
alone,
certainly
come
pretty
close
to
cage,
but
the
balance
of
the
sentence
explains
that
the
reasonable
doubt
has
to
be
as
distinguished
from
a
doubt
arising
from
a
mere
possibility,
bare
imagination,
or
fanciful
conjecture,
and
viewed
with
that,
perhaps
it
isn't
a
misstatement.

well,
i'm
not
sure
it
is.
it
was
included
in
cage,
but
it
isn't
clear
to
me
that
that
standing
alone
would
have
been
found
to
be
a
violation
of
cage.

do
you
acknowledge
that
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
moral
certainty,
has
changed
over
time?
justice
sandra

o'connor
have
the
dictionary
definitions
of
it
changed?
