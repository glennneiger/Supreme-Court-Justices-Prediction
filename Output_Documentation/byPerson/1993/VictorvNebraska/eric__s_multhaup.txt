mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
multhaup.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
regarding
the
sandoval
instruction,
the
first
point
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
this
instruction
lacks
much...
lacks
any
of
the
potentially
corrective
language
found
in
its
progenitor,
the
extended
discussion
of
reasonable
doubt
found
in
commonwealth
v.
shaw,
and
the
corrective
language
found
in
the
current
massachusetts
version
of...
of
defining
reasonable
doubt,
the
updated
shaw
version
found
at
page
18
of
appendix
b.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
exactly.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
your
honor,
you're
raising
an
interesting
point
more
as
to
the
scope
of
american
education
than
as
to
whether
it
was
a
technical
versus
nontechnical
term,
and
my
belief
is
that
anybody
who
knew
what
the
phrase
meant
at
all
knew
what
it
meant
in
the
terms
that
justice
shaw
penned
it.
whether
it
was
a
term
that
was
oblivious
to
2
percent
or
92
percent
of
the
american
public,
i
don't
know,
but
at
the
time--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--yes,
your
honor,
and
as
we
traced
from
our
petitioner's
opening
brief
through
the
reply
brief,
the
common
meaning
of
moral
certainty
as
reflected
in
lexicographical
sources
meant
moral
certainty
in
terms
of
the
highest
degree
of
certainty
that
you
could
obtain,
based
on
empirical
evidence
from
daniel
webster's...
noel
webster's
first
dictionary
in
1827
through
approximately
the
turn
of
the
century.
then,
at
the
turn
of
the
century,
dictionaries
began
having...
including
definitions
or
substituting
definitions
much
more
consistent
with
the
current
definitions,
that
being
probable,
strong
probability,
for
practical
purpose
as
opposed
to
legal
purposes.
those
phrases
are
drawn
from
the
1906
version
quoted
in
the
reply
brief,
so
the
transformation
occurred
somewhere
around
the
turn
of
the
century.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
that's
certainly
true,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
brings
up...
that
brings
up
the
fundamental
problem
in
this
case,
where
lawyers
and
judges
as
law-trained
people
hear
this
phrase
as
reiterating
what
they
have
learned
since
the
beginning
of
law
school
and
throughout
their
practice,
while
the
lay
public
uses
it,
understands
it
in
a
very
different
manner,
and
they're--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--i
think
that
is
a
very
unlikely
possibility.
how
reasonable...
how
sensible
would
it
be
for
a
defense
attorney
to,
having
scanned
the
dictionary
definitions
contained
or
reviewed
in
petitioner's
opening
brief,
a
fairly
extensive,
exhaustive
review
of
american
dictionaries--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--nobody
asks
for
it,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe.
i
believe
that
it's
given
as
a
matter
of
historical
inertia.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
no,
i...
if
your
honor's
referring
to
the
caljic
review
in
the
mid-1980's,
that
review
went
so
far
as
to
consist
of
asking
the
lawyers
and
judges
whether
they
saw
any
reason
for
changing
the
instruction.
by
analogy,
if,
for
example,
a
president
conducted
a
survey
of
whether
health
care
reform
was
needed
by
a
survey
of
pharmacists
and
physicians,
that
would
not
carry
a
lot
of
credibility.
the
question
is
what
the
instruction
means
to
the
public
who
are
serving
on
juries,
not
what
it
means
to
the
lawyers
and
judges
who
are
immersed
in
it.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
test.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
yes.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
i
don't
know
what
percent
use
it
in
their
ordinary
conversation,
but
i
do
know
that
there's
a
high
likelihood
that
most
people
hear
it
used
in
contemporary
parlance
in
the
newspapers,
as
indicated
by
our
contemporary
references.
in
petitioner's
brief
we
survey
a
number
of
usages
of
both
moral
certainty
and
moral
evidence...
the
new
york
times,
the
washington
post,
the
sacramento
beat...
so
that
it's
familiar
to
people.
the
usage
that's
consistent
with
the
dictionary
sources
is
familiar
to
people.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
no.
no,
your
honor,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
what
is
the
most
likely
explanation
that
a
juror,
a
california
juror,
sandoval's
jurors,
understood
for
moral
certainty.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
i
disagree
with
that
as
a
factual
matter,
your
honor.
there's
only...
there's
no
american
dictionary
which
uses
it
consistent
with
reasonable
doubt,
and
only
the
oxford
english
dictionary,
which
is
well-known
for
preserving
historical
meanings,
is
consistent
with
contemporary
usage.
respondent--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--i
was
more...
petitioner
sandoval
focused
more
on
those
dictionary
definitions
which
specifically
took
the
phrase,
moral
certainty,
as
a
phrase,
rather
than
simply
the
word,
moral
certainty.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well,
that
question
is--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--i
would
put
it
exactly
as...
first
of
all,
there
are
any
number
of
possible
definitions
for,
consistent
with
the
concept
of
reasonable
doubt.
there's
no
one
true
way
to
do
it.
what
i
would
recommend
as
the
simplest
solution
to
the
california
quandary
would
be
to
take
the
rendition
given
by
professor
shapiro
in
her
article
in
the
thirtieth
hastings
law
review,
where
she
took...
set
forth
in
full
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
a
footnote
on
approximately
page
35,
where
she
took
the
webster
instruction...
she's
a
historian
and
rhetoricist
at
cal,
and
immersed
herself
in
the
history
of
what
reasonable
doubt
was
supposed
to
mean,
and
then
rendered
the
webster
instruction
into
contemporary
english,
and
it
starts
off
with
some
of
the
exact
phrases
that
your
honor
uses.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
yes.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
yes.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
your
honor,
it
pertains
to
human
action
when
a
civil
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
liability.
it
pertains
to
a
human
action
when
a
fact
finder
returns
a
finding
according
to
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
criminal
juries
know
that
they're
dealing
with
human
actions,
of
course,
but
the
standard
of
certainty
has
to
be
way
up
there
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
of
evidentiary
certainty.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
yes.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--well,
i
question
whether
a
juror
hearing
that
would
be
able
to
distinguish
whether
a
juror's
level
of
certainty
had
to
rise
merely
to
say
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
or
had
to
rise
above
that
to
the
utmost
certainty.
that
sentence
that
you
read
is
equally
consistent
with
both,
and
under
that
circumstance,
because
the
dictionary
definitions,
the
current
usage,
is
more
consistent
with
clear
and
convincing
evidence
than
it
is
with
utmost
certainty--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--it
means--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--well,
see,
there's
where
we
have
a
fundamental
disagreement,
because
if
you
take
any
american
dictionary
that
does
have
the
phrase,
moral
certainty,
defined
in
it...
moral
certainty,
and
a
definition...
it's
clearly
inconsistent
with
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it's
only
consistent
with
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
respondents
don't
contend
otherwise
they
don't
contend
that
any
of
the
definitions
of
moral
certainty
or
any
of
the
usages
of
moral
certainty
are
consistent
with
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
fight
elsewhere.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
i
certainly
did.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
i
count
that
as
the
most...
as
the
most
widely
recognized
dictionary--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--to
preserve
historical
meanings
at
the
expense
of
current
american
usage.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
yes.
we
have
one
english--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--pardon
me?
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
i
think
your
honor
is
exactly
correct
in
using
the
word,
purport,
because
we
have...
we
have
twelve
american-published
dictionaries
giving
definitions
of
moral
certainty
inconsistent
with
the
standard
that
we
all
know
in
our
minds
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
we
have
one
venerable
english
dictionary...
everybody
enjoys
reading
the
oed...
consistent
with
the
historical
meaning.
the
question
is,
how
are
jurors
in
california,
in
los
angeles,
when
they
read
moral
certainty,
are
they
going...
is
it
going
to
resound
in
their
minds
as
consistent
with
how
they
hear
it
in
the
l.a.
times,
how
it's
read,
or
are
they
going
to
say,
maybe
it's
meant
the
way
john
locke
meant
it
150
or
300
years
ago.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
no.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
by
referring
to...
if
you
refer
to
usage
and
definitions
of
the
word,
moral,
separate
from
the
phrase,
moral
certainty,
there
are
22
different
definitions,
nuances,
subtleties
of
the
word,
moral,
including
sexually
virtuous,
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
context
of
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction
here.
each
time...
each
indication
that
we
have,
and
sandoval
is
not
conjuring
these
things
up,
sandoval
has
his
nose
in
the
dictionary
and
his
nose
in
newspapers
trying
to
find
out
how
people
are
actually
use
these
phrases.
moral
certainty
has
its
own
meaning,
which
has
evolved
today.
the
point
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
this
instruction
is
defective
not
only
because
of
that
phrase.
cage
didn't
purport
to
constitute
an
exhaustive
list
of
constitutional
defects.
the
phrase,
moral
evidence
in
this
case
compounds
the
problem
for
moral
certainty
for
the
following
reason.
moral
evidence,
as
currently
understood,
as
opposed
to
its
historical
usage,
means,
according
to
the
same
dictionaries
that
we've
been
consulting,
pertaining
to
character,
pertaining
to
tendencies
of
human
nature.
when
juxtaposed
with
those
aspects
of
moral...
of
the
definitions
of
moral
certainty,
which
are,
such
as
based
on
a
strong
likelihood
rather
than
on
solid
evidence,
invites
the
juror
to
use
their
view
of
what's
the
moral
character
of
sandoval
here?
what
can
i
piece
together
about
sandoval's
moral
character,
based
on
the
moral
evidence
involved,
to
supplement
the
prosecutor's
factual
evidence.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
your
honor,
that...
the
answer
to
that
question
is
not
necessary
to
the
decision
here,
but
the
overwhelming
weight,
48
out
of
the
53
jurisdictions
surveyed
do
give
a
definition
of
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well,
your
honor,
i'd
say
43
out
of
the
definitions
contained
in
petitioner's
exhibit
b
from
around
the
country
are
satisfactory.
a
good
one
is
found
in
petitioner's
brief
at
footnote
26.
that's
where
professor
shapiro
takes
the
language
of
shaw
and
translates
it
into
the
contemporary
american
idiom.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well,
your
honor,
my
understanding
is
that's
what
this
court
has
said.
in
winship,
this
court
said
that
it
would
be
wrong,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process,
for
people
to
be
convicted
except
on
utmost
certainty.
now,
utmost
might
be
overstating
it
in
fact.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--would
it
be
constitutional
to
convict
if
an
instruction
had
been
given
sort
of
tracking
your
honor's
phrasings?
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
it
would
be
constitutional
because
you
had
the
removal
of
doubt
involved,
and
some--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
certainly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
oh,
about
things
that
happen...
about
things
that
happen
in
the
world,
and
realistically
the...
we
have
three
standards
of
proof,
preponderance,
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
these
are
ranges
of
certainty.
there's
no
mathematics
here.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
of
course
not,
and
it's
foolish
to
assign
numbers.
there's
an
interesting
discussion
by
judge
posner
in
u.s.
v.
hall,
854
fed
2d,
about
how
badly
uninstructed
jurors
understand
the
concept
of
reasonable
doubt
when
they're
asked
to
put
numbers
on.
it's
been
characterized
as
ridiculously
low.
but
let's
stay
away
from
numbers.
let's
make
sure
that
a
constitutionally
correct
instruction
distinguishes
for
a
jury
between
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
not
good
enough,
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
still
not
good
enough,
lead
them
up
to
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
webster
instruction
in
massachusetts
does
just
that.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well,
sandoval's
position
is
that
whether
or
not
there's
a
constitutional
obligation
to
define
it,
you
can't
give
an
instruction
which
drags
the
jury
away
from
the
core
concept.
if
it's
not
defined,
it's
hard
to
say
that
the
words,
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
are
so
devoid
of
meaning
to
a
reasonable
jury
that
they're
left
asea.
of
course,
if
a
defendant
wants
a
particular
instruction
on...
wants
one
defined,
i
believe
that
certainly
the
court
would
be
obligated
to
give
it,
to
specify
to
the
jury--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--well,
i
would
certainly
argue
on
behalf
of
a
client
who--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--yes.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
there's
no
law
whatsoever
that
says
it's
flatly
unconstitutional
not
to
define
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
no
question
about
that.
cage,
on
the
other
hand,
is
clear
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
drag
the
jury
away
from
the
core
concept
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i'd
like
to
conclude
by
pointing
out
that
under
the
boyde
analysis
we
have
to
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole
here,
where
here
the
jury's
deliberating
for
14
days.
the
likelihood
that
there
was
a
compromise
somewhere
at
the
very
lowest
degree
of
certainty
consistent
with
the
instructions
that
the
jury
could
reach
to
get
consensus...
given
the
weakness
of
the
prosecution's
case,
the
indeterminacy
of
the
eyewitness
identification,
the
unreliability
of
the
informer,
there's
more
than
a
reasonable
likelihood
here
that
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
inconsistent
with
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
there's
an
actual
likelihood.
that's
more
than
boyde
requires.
boyde
doesn't
require
that
the
petitioner
prove
more
likely
than
not,
just
that
there
is
a
likelihood,
more
than
a
speculation.
sandoval's
case,
the
jury
was
invited
to
take
bits
and
pieces
of
the
evidence,
fanned
by
the
prosecutor,
to
portray
an
image
of
him
as
a
stereotypical
hispanic,
east
los
angeles
gangster.
the
prosecutor
argues,
take
a
thug
like
this,
imagine
him
in
the
streets.
he's
got
a
mustache,
he's
got
a
different
hairstyle,
he's
wearing
different
clothes...
that's
sandoval.
that's
the
type
of
stereotypical
evidence
that
the
jury
is
going
to
use
under
the
moral
evidence
rubric
to
supplement
the
apparent
shortfalls
in
the
prosecution's
factual
objective
case.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
thank
you.
