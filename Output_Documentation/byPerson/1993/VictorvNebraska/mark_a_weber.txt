mr.
mark
a.
weber
thank
you,
mr.
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
nebraska
supreme
court
failed
to
properly
apply
the
constitutional
principles
set
forth
in
cage
v.
louisiana
to
a
jury
instruction
in
nebraska
containing
virtually
identical
language.
the
facts
of
this
case
specific
to
the
issue
of
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction
are
whether
or
not
the
defendant,
clarence
victor,
the
petitioner,
was
properly
convicted
of
first
degree
murder,
and
whether
or
not
it
was
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
mr.
victor
killed
purposely
and
with
deliberate
and
premeditated
malice.
the
responsibility
for
the
death
of
the
victim
in
this
case
is
not
at
issue.
with
respect
to
the
specific
instruction,
i
feel
it
is
most
simple
to
break
it
down
into
two
basic
parts.
the
instruction
given
in
mr.
victor's
trial,
nji
14.08,
is
found
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
11.
as
i
see
it--
mr.
mark
a.
weber
--well,
i
do
believe
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
do
warrant
looking
at
the
instruction
as
a
whole,
but
i
think
the
plain
meaning
of
the
instruction,
also
consistent
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
would
be
to
see
two
basic
parts,
one
being
the
burden
for
conviction,
the
other
being
the
burden
for
acquittal,
and
in
this
particular
instruction
i
see
those
two
parts
coming
out
in
the
plain
meaning
given
to
it.
with
respect
to
that
instruction,
i
would
draw
a
line
after
the
sentence,
"you
may
find
the
accused
guilty
upon
the
strong
probabilities
of
the
case
provided
such
probabilities
are
strong
enough
to
exclude
any
doubt
of
his
guilt
that
is
reasonable.
"
and
i
believe
the
following
sentence
to
the
end
of
that
instruction
is
the
burden
in
order
to
acquit,
and
as
i've
said,
i
believe
the
burden
to
convict
in
this
case
similar
to
in
cage
is
too
low,
and
the
burden
to
acquit
too
high.
in
this
particular
instance,
with
this
instruction,
a
conviction
is
allowed
on
the
strong
probabilities
of
the
case
and
to
a
moral
certainty,
as
determined
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
of
strong
probabilities,
and
i
believe
the
plain
meaning
of
the
instruction,
that
initial
part
with
respect
to
conviction,
the
strong
probability
as
read
with
the
other
portions
of
the
conviction-related
portion
of
the
instruction,
allow
conviction
on
something
that
is
tantamount
to
a
civil
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
yes,
i
do.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
well,
as
recognized,
the
standard
has
changed
somewhat
and
specifically
with
respect
to
boyde--
mr.
mark
a.
weber
--yes.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
i
believe
so,
in
the
sense
that
as
recognized
i
believe
in
estelle,
if
not
also
in...
recognized
previously
in
franklin,
there
might
be
a
new
test
when
it
comes
to
interpretation
of
jury
instructions
and
particularly
in
this
case
with
respect
to
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
well,
as
you
found
in...
taking
winship
in
conjunction
with
sullivan,
just
decided
by
the
court
last
year,
the
concept
of
reasonable
doubt
and
the
burden
of
the
government
to
prove
reasonable
doubt,
to
prove
conviction
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
is
so
fundamental
that
i
believe
it
would
be
a
recognized
exception
to
basic
rules
of
interpretation.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
well,
again
i
refer
only
to
sullivan
in
the
sense
that
it's
such
a
fundamental
guarantee
with
respect
to
due
process,
the
fundamental
right
of
trial
by
jury,
and
relieving
the
state
of
its
burden.
i
believe
you
recognized
in
sandstrom
and
in
franklin
that
relief
of
the
state's
burden
is
a
fundamental
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
and
i
spoke
in
error
with
respect
to
interpretation
of
other
instructions.
i
believe
that
if
there
is
a
standard
it
is
the
plain
meaning
standard
which
would
be
equally
applicable
to
all
instructions.
we
do
have
the
strong--
mr.
mark
a.
weber
--it
is
not,
your
honor.
following
the
decision
in
cage,
the...
specifically
with
my
own
experience
the
douglas
county
district
court
in
omaha,
nebraska,
that
county
ceased
using
the
instruction
for
the
most
part.
there
were
subsequent
decisions
by
certain
courts,
specifically
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
nebraska,
distinguishing
the
objectionable
instruction
from
that
given
in
cage,
and
i
can
note
in
all
candor
that
some
district
judges
then
did
recommence
using
the
instructions,
the
instruction
that
is
objectionable
here.
i
think
it
is
fairly
safe
to
say
that
because
of
the
state
of
the
uncertainty
with
respect
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska
holding
the
distinction
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
invalid
that
most,
if
not
all
of
the
courts
in
the
state
of
nebraska
no
longer
use
the
defective
instruction
and
rather
use
the
instruction
that
is
referred
to
as...
it's
contained
within
the
appendix
to
counsel
for
sandoval's
brief
at
page
b-23,
nji
second
criminal
instruction
2.0,
which
was
passed
in
1992.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
safe
to
say
it
was.
however,
there
is
some
authority
from
the
eighth
circuit
specifically
with
respect
to
using
strong
probabilities
language
up
to
approximately
20
years
ago
questioning
that
language.
i
understand
that
the
strong
probabilities
of
the
case
language
has
been
approved
in
and
of
itself
in
other
decisions...
i
believe
in
dunbar.
however,
it
is
not
my
argument
that
this
instruction
is
to
be
looked
at
under
a
microscope.
in
looking
at
poison
pills
i
understand
that
is
not
the
test,
but
with
respect
to
the
instruction
taken
as
a
whole
in
allowing
conviction
in
this
case
based
upon
the
strong
probabilities
of
the
case,
that
is
basically
allowing
a
jury
to
convict
on
a
possibility
of
guilt,
which
of
course
is
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
i
think
taking
again
the
entire
portion
of
the
instruction
that
i
believe
relates
to
conviction
in
context,
it
reaffirms
the
jury's
ability
to
find
guilt
on
a
civil...
what
is
more
akin
to
a
civil
preponderance
standard.
and
that
specifically
is
the
sentence
that
follows,
"excuse
me",
but
precedes
the
strong
probabilities
language,
and
that,
and
i
quote,
"you
may
find
an
accused
guilty.
"
--excuse
me.
"you
may
be
convinced
of
the
truth
of
a
fact
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
yet
be
fully
aware
that
possibly
you
may
be
mistaken.
"
in
my
mind,
that
reaffirms...
in
the
plain
meaning
reaffirms
a
jury's
ability
to
convict
on
a
civil
preponderance
standard.
you
take
that
hand-in-hand
with
the
moral
certainty
language
contained
in
cage,
it
even
allows
the
worst
possible
of
scenarios
that
a
jury
can
convict,
in
this
case
find
first
degree
murder,
in
spite
of
or
on
evidence
other
than
that
presented
at
trial.
the
respondent
adheres
to
the
distinction
drawn
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
it
adheres
to
a
rationale
that
i
believe
the
federal
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska
indicated
called
for
an
exercise
in
mental
gymnastics.
it
belies
logic
that
a
juror
reading
this
instruction
would
not
be
reasonably
likely
to
misapply
constitutional
principles
and
allow
conviction
on
something
more
akin
to
the
civil
preponderance
standard.
with
respect
to
the
second
portion
of
the
instruction,
acquittal
is
not
permitted
and
perhaps
this
is
the
most
heinous
violation
of
the
instruction,
unless
reasonable
doubt
is
equivalent
to
a
substantial
doubt,
and
i
submit
that
very
first
sentence
of
what
i
have
carved
out
to
be
the
second
portion,
or
the
acquittal
portion
of
the
instruction,
defines
is
the
only
real
and
true
definition
of
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
justice
o'connor,
with
respect
to
reading
the
entire
sentence,
but
i
think
what
we're
looking
at
here
is
a
continuum,
with
mere
possibility
or
fanciful
conjecture
at
one
end,
and
we
can't
ignore
the
language
that
i
believe
you
omitted
in
your
question,
and
that
is
the
substantial
doubt.
the
substantial
doubt,
as
you
noted,
is
concededly
violative
of
cage.
we
have
mere
possibility
at
one
end,
substantial
doubt
on
the
other--
mr.
mark
a.
weber
--i
tend
to
agree
with
you.
i
don't
think
we
look
at
these
in
a
vacuum,
and
we
do
not
look
at
these
standing
alone,
much
as
the
respondent
has
attempted
to
do,
as
well
as
the
amici
in
this
case,
looking
at
each
particular
term,
but
when
you
take
all
the
terms
standing
as
a
whole,
the
graver
and
more
important
transactions
of
life,
the
moral
certainty
language,
the
strong
probabilities
of
the
case
language,
and
the
actual
and
substantial
doubt,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
it
was
reasonably
likely
that
the
jury
in
this
particular
case
misapplied
constitutional
principles
and
deprived
the
petitioner
of
due
process.
i
had
anticipated
your
question
to
be
that
perhaps
the
fact
that
the
substantial
doubt
language
refers
to
the
evidence
that
that
somehow
salvages
this
instruction.
indeed,
that's
what
the
respondent
would
have
you
believe.
the
simple
response
is
that
it's
irrelevant
whether
or
not
the
basis
is
the
evidence
or,
as
moral
certainty
would
suggest,
something
other
than
the
evidence
and
independent
of
the
evidence.
if
the
doubt
is
too
high
to
acquit
a
particular
defendant,
it
is
still
unconstitutional.
i
believe,
again
with
respect
to
the
substantial
doubt
language,
you
take
in
conjunction
the
sentence
that
allows
the
jury
to
consider
the
fact
that
they
can
convict
and
still
be
aware
that
they're
possibly
mistaken
reaffirms
in
the
jury's
mind
that
the
standard
is
not
as
high,
they
may
convict
on
a
strong
probability
and
not
on
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
feel
it
necessary,
because
it
was
addressed
within
the
briefs,
to
respond
to
allegations
made
with
respect
to
procedural
bar
and
retroactivity
in
this
case.
indeed,
the
issue
of
retroactivity
was
presented
in
the
issue
that
certiorari
was
granted.
with
respect
to
procedural
bar,
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
why
we
are
properly
before
this
court.
the
merits
were
indeed
addressed
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
and
under
michigan
v.
long
i
believe
were
properly
before
this
court.
also,
with
respect
to
a
distinction
found
in
teague
with
respect
to
harris
v.
reid,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
ambiguity
in
the
opinion
of
the
nebraska
supreme
court
concerning
the
merits
of
this
case.
indeed,
the
most
recent
opinion
on
this
particular
instruction,
state
v.
cook,
a
westlaw
cite
out
of
nebraska
from
last
month,
indicates
that
in
spite
of
this
court
granting
certiorari
in
this
case,
and
in
spite
of
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska
holding
the
distinction
drawn
by
the
state
of
nebraska,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
nebraska,
they
would
adhere
to
their
distinction
drawn
between
this
defective
instruction
and
the
defective
instruction
in
louisiana,
and
i
believe
again
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
not
at
all,
your
honor.
obviously,
it's
the
distinction
drawn.
there
has
to
be
some
between
mathematical
certainty--
mr.
mark
a.
weber
--the
problem...
excuse
me.
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
today
moral
certainty
doesn't
mean
today
what
it
did
at
the
time
that
the
instruction
was
passed,
and
as
sandoval
counsel--
mr.
mark
a.
weber
--counsel
will
point
out
to
you
the
instruction
means
something
totally
different
today.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
that's
the
problem,
justice
scalia,
it
has
several
different
meanings.
it
is
certainly
possible
that
someone
will
properly
interpret
the
term,
moral
certainty,
in
and
of
itself
to
mean
something
that
it
is
supposed
to
mean,
but
is
it
reasonably
likely,
taking
that
instruction
in
context,
the
meaning
moral
certainty
is
the
same
as
a
civil
preponderance
standard,
which
is
almost
what
the
instruction
says?
mr.
mark
a.
weber
yes.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
that,
as
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
have
noted,
we
are
not
necessarily
to
parse
language
and
view
the
particular
terms
under
a
microscope,
and
i'm
saying
it
is
certainly
possible,
indeed,
reasonably
likely,
that
a
jury
looking
at
the
moral
certainty
language
and
noting
that
they
can
convict
on
the
strong
probabilities
of
the
case
that
those
are
tantamount
to
similar
or
same
meanings,
and
it's
reasonably
likely
that
they
will
be
given
that
meaning
by
a
jury.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
to
me
i
believe
it
does,
and
i
believe
it
does
to
the
common
juror,
and
i
believe
that's
what
we
need
to
focus
upon
here.
obviously,
as
i
think
is
noted
in
the
briefs,
the
court
and
certainly
counsel
have
focused
upon
these
terms
ad
nauseam.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
yes,
and
the
problem
is
that
we
maybe
have
removed
ourselves
too
far
from
what
the
common
juror
on
the
street
is
going
to
think
when
they
look
at
this
instruction,
and
if
we're
to
do
the
best
we
can
and
look
at
the
instruction
as
a
whole,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
when
you
look
at
what
i
submit
is
the
conviction
language,
and
that
takes
the
graver
more
important
transactions
of
life
language,
the
moral
certainty
language,
and
the
strong
probability
language
taken
together.
it
certainly
on
a
continuum
pushes
the
standard
much,
much
closer
to
what
would
be
the
same
as
a
civil
greater
weight
of
the
evidence...
the
reaffirmation
that
you
can
find
the
defendant
guilty
by
the
greater
weight
of
the
evidence,
read
greater
weight
of
the
evidence
and
still
be
aware
of
the
possibility
that
you
may
be
mistaken,
i
think
is
consistent
with
what
a
reasonable
juror
would
look
at.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
certainly,
but
another
reading
of
that
instruction
would
be
that
possibly
the
decision
to
acquit
in
this
case
could
be
grave
and
thus,
again,
raising
the
burden
of
the
defendant
unconstitutionally.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
if--
mr.
mark
a.
weber
--but
i
also
think
the
more
clear
definition
of
reasonable
doubt
provided
in
the
instruction
is
the
one
at
the
conclusion
of
the
instruction,
that
being
a
reasonable
doubt
is
an
actual
and
substantial
doubt.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
i'm
only--
mr.
mark
a.
weber
--i
understand.
i
only
look
at
it
in
the
context
that
if
we
read
the
instruction
as
a
whole
there
are
certain
possibilities
of
juror
interpretation,
and
with
those
possibilities
it's
reasonably
likely
that
a
jury
would
misapply
constitutional
principles.
i
would
like
to
save
a
little
time
for
rebuttal,
and
accordingly
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
portions
that
i
think
in
context
we
need
to
look
at.
this
case
is
unique
in
that
certiorari
was
denied
on
direct
appeal
and
this
issue
was
properly
presented
to
the
court
at
that
time.
and
if
in
fact
we
somehow
fall
between
a
griffith
style
application
of
the
rules
of
this
court
or
a
teague
problem,
i
do
not
feel
first
of
all
that
we
should
be
in
a
teague-related
situation.
it
is
more
akin
to
griffin
in
that
we
have
satisfied
the
requirements
that
the
issue
was
presented
on
direct
appeal.
the
state
concedes
that
it
was
presented
on
direct
appeal,
and
in
fact
with
respect
to
the
default
issue,
the
state
did
not
object
on
a
procedural
basis
in
its
app
cert
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
teague,
we
certainly
would
fall
under
the
second
exception
where
fundamental
fairness
of
trial
is
compromised
in
that
conviction
would
be
undermined
or
in
this
case
would
diminish
the
likelihood
of
obtaining
a
conviction.
in
this
case
we
have
a
fundamental
violation
of
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
due
process
violations
as
well
as
the
fifth
amendment
guarantees,
as
noted
in
winship,
that
the
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
is
required,
and
also
the
sixth
amendment
trial
by
jury
guarantees
that
were
noted
within
sandstrom
and
franklin.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
thank
you.
one
of
the
matters
that
i
initially
would
like
to
take
exception
to
is
again
the
emphasis
by
the
nebraska
attorney
general
that
somehow
legions
of
individuals
are
going
to
be
affected,
in
essence,
the
doors
of
the
prisons
left
wide
open
in
the
state
of
nebraska
because
of
the
throwing
out
of
this
invalid
instruction,
but
i
believe
justice
souter
recognized
that
this
fear,
as
i've
said
before,
is
a
gross
exaggeration.
i
don't
believe
there
are
very
many,
at
all,
individuals
similarly
situated
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
as
mr.
stenberg
i
believe
later
recognized,
i
believe
there
are
only
a
handful
of
individuals
that
objected
to
this
instruction
under
direct
review,
as
petitioner
did
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
a.
weber
that's
a
good
question.
i
would
take
exception
to
the
california
attorney
general.
i
believe
that
just
the
mere
fact
that
that
language
happens
to
be
lectured
upon
within
the
defense
manuals
from
my
perspective
from
the
defense
bar
is
more
of
a
tacit
admission
that
we're
stuck
with
what
we've
got
and
we've
got
to
make
some
sort
of
headway
with
that
language.
i
don't
believe
you'll
find
many
defense
counsel
certainly
within
douglas
county,
nebraska,
where
i
practice,
would
concede
that
the
moral
certainty
language
is
something
that
we
like.
indeed,
just
submit
the
instruction
i
referred
to
recently...
or,
excuse
me,
the
instruction
used
now,
again
contained
in
b-23
of
petitioner
sandoval's
brief
as
an
appendix,
none
of
the
defective
language...
moral
certainty
certainly
is
not
contained
within
that
instruction,
and
i
would
submit
that,
as
mr.
stenberg
noted,
the
plaintiffs
bar
of
the
state
of
nebraska
as
well
as
the
defense
bar
were
involved
in
the
construction
and
creation
of
this
instruction.
if
that
language
were
so
readily
wanted
and
so
defensible
by
the
attorney
general,
then
i
would
wonder
why
there
wasn't
some
sort
of
stipulation
that
the
moral
certainty
language
would
be
contained
within
that
instruction.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
idea
that
other
individuals
had
not
raised
this
particular
issue
on
direct
appeal,
and
perhaps
they
would,
i
would
submit
that
number
1,
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
but
number
2,
it's
directly
addressed
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
the
state
v.
van
akron,
in
which,
similar
to
cage,
the
court
recognized
the
plain
error
analysis
ability
to
review
the
instruction,
and
quite
frankly,
as
the
court
noted
in
that
opinion,
the
raising
of
that
issue
at
trial,
much
for
the
same
reason
it
wasn't
raised
at
trial
in
this
case,
was
due
to
the
futility
of
raising
it
in
light
of
its
prior
decisions
distinguishing
the
instruction
given
in
nebraska
from
the
defective
instruction
in
cage.
finally,
i
find
it
very
interesting
that
the
attorney
general
concedes
at
the
beginning
that
we're
not
supposed
to
parse
language
and
look
at
the
individual
terms,
and
yet
he
spends
a
great
deal
of
his
time
arguing
about...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
