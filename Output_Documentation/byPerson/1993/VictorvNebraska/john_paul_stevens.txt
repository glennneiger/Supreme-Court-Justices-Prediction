justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about
that?
it's
the...
unless
you've
reached
the
highest
level
of
certainty
of
the
defendant's
guilt
that
it's
possible
to
have
about
things
that
happen
in
the
real
world.
that...
you
think
that
any
court
has
ever
set
a
standard
that's
that
high?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
a
juror
said
to
another
juror,
i
really
am
convinced
the
man
did
it,
but
i'd
be
even
more
convinced
if
we'd
seen
it
on
television
at
the
same
time,
but
we
didn't.
i'd
really
be
positive
then.
i
don't
have
any...
i
really
don't
have
any
doubt,
but
i'd
be
more
convinced
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
convict
or
acquit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
really
mean
to
suggest
you
can
never
convict
if
you
can
conceive
of
a
case
that
would
be
even
more
convincing
than
the
one
you've
seen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
may
never
convict
if
you
can
conceive
of
a
set
of
evidence
that
would
be
even
more
convincing
than
the
evidence
that
was
actually
presented?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
this
instruction
says
at
footnote
26.
it
says,
it
must
be
the
highest
degree
of
certainty
that
the
human
mind
can
reach.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one/s
51
percent,
one's
75
percent...
what
is
the
top
one,
90,
99,
100?
it's
not
100,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
10
years.
it
doesn't
take
10
years
to
exhaust
direct
review
in
all
these
states,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
the
defense
bar
been
regularly
objecting
to
all
these
instructions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lungren,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
do
you
think,
as
a
theoretical
matter,
and
i...
assuming
there's
been
some
change
in
it,
but
let's
assume
for
present
purposes
the
change
isn't
enough,
as
of
today,
to
invalidate
the
instruction.
would
you
agree
with
the
thesis
that
at
least
it
is
conceivable
that
over
the
years
the
term
could
have
an
additional
change
in
meaning
that
sooner
or
later
would
make
it
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
argument.
in
that
light,
in
order
to
avoid
the
risk
of
further
changes
and
the
same
kind
of
problem
of
retroactivity
and
the
like,
do
you
think
california
would
be
better
off...
now,
just,
really,
it's
a
close
question
for
me...
simply
to
omit
the
words,
to
a
moral
certainty,
from
the
last
line
of
their
standard
charge?
they'd
avoid
this
risk
of
further
charge,
and
i
don't
know,
frankly,
whether
that
makes
it
a
higher
or
lower
burden
than
with
or
without
the
words,
but
i'm
curious
to
know
what
your
view
of
the
case
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
taking
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
other
words,
you
think
the
words,
to
a
moral
certainty,
enhance
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point,
is
the
reason
that
defense
counsel
may
not
have
objected
to
the
instruction
the
reason
given
by
the
california
attorney
general
that
they
think
putting
in,
to
a
moral
certainty,
provides
someone
a
good
argument
to
the
jury?
