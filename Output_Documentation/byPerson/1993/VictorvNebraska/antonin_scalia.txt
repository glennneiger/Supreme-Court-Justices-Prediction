in
this
case
we
just
didn't
have
the
use
of
the
phrase,
moral
certainty,
by
itself.
it
was
also
specifically
opposed
to
and
absolute
or
a
mathematical
certainty.
don't
you
think
that
eliminates
whatever
confusion
might
otherwise
exist?
what
kind
of
a
certainty
would
you
describe
as
being
required,
absolute
certainty?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
moral
certainty,
that
certainty
which
is
the
only
certainty
that
can
be
had
pertaining
to
human
conduct...
moral
certainty.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
does
to
me.
maybe
it
does
not
have
only
that
meaning.
maybe
it
has
acquired
another,
and
indeed,
quite
contrary
meaning,
but
at
least
when
it's
used
in
a
charge
that
opposes
it
to
mathematical
certainty.
i
mean,
if
i
just
said
moral
certainty,
then
i
can
understand
the
argument,
but
if
it
says,
you
know,
it
must
be
to
a
moral
certainty,
not
a
mathematical
certainty,
what
other
possible
meaning
could
it
have
than
the
old
meaning
of
moral
certainty?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
your
burden
to
show
that
it
has
to
be
reasonably
likely
that
it
would
be
misunderstood,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
i
certainly
don't
agree
with
that
as
to
the
first
sentence,
as
to
the
"such
a
doubt
as
would
cause
a
reasonable
and
prudent
person
in
one
of
the
graver,
more
important
transactions
of
life
to
pause
and
hesitate
before
taking
the
representative
facts
as
true.
"
are
you
saying
you
only
pause
or
hesitate
when
the
fact
is...
you
only
pause
or
hesitate
when
the
fact
is
true
by
a
bare
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
takes
much
more
certainty
than
that
to
eliminate
any
hesitation
on
my
part.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
take
that
first
sentence
to
define
reasonable
doubt
in
such
a
way
to
say
the
kind
of
doubt
that
would
cause
you
to
pause.
well,
boy,
i
pause
somewhat
well
short
of
preponderance.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
i'll
give
you
that
one,
but
you
were
trying
to
use
the
first
sentence
as
supporting
your
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i
think
it's
something
you
have
to
overcome
rather
than
something
you
can
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
have
to
do
that
from
its
context,
wouldn't
you,
and
although
i
happen
to
agree
with
you
that
the
word
has
acquired
a
different
meaning,
i'm
not
sure
it
has
eliminated
the
original
meaning.
some
modern
dictionaries
continue
to
use
that
original
meaning,
don't
they,
as
one
of
the
possible
meanings
of
moral
certainty?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that
means
it's
a
better
dictionary.
webster's
third
gives
us
one
of
the
meanings...
capable
of
being
judged
as
good
or
evil...
meaning
moral.
this
is
the
word
you're
looking
up
in
all
of
these.
moral,
capable
of
being
judged
as
good
or
evil
in
terms
of
principles
of
right
and
wrong
action,
resulting
from
or
belonging
to
human
character,
conduct,
or
intentions,
and
that's
what
moral...
when
you
use
moral
in
the
phrase,
moral
certainty,
it
means
the
certainty
that
pertains
to
judgment
of
human
actions,
and
i
take
that
to
be
an
indication
of
that
definition.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well,
but
you
couldn't
expect
every
dictionary
to
single
out
the
phrase,
moral
certainty.
most
of
them
don't
have
that
phrase
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
look
up
the
word,
moral,
and
see
how
it
would
be
used
with
certainty.
how
would
you
explain
the
concept
that
used
to
be
described
by
the
word,
moral
certainty?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
wanted
to
explain
to
a
juror...
i
don't
want
mathematical
certainty.
you
can
never
have
mathematical
certainty.
i
mean,
deciding
whether
somebody
committed
a
crime
is
not
like
2
plus
2
equals
4.
you
can
never
be
mathematically
certain.
now,
how
would
you
put
the
fact
that
you're
not
asking
for
mathematical
certainty?
you
might
well
say,
you
want
moral...
i
would
say
that.
you
want
moral
certainty.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you
that
that
would
be
a
better
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
question
before
us
here
is
whether
it
was
likely
that
not
doing
that...
likely
that
not
doing
that
misled
the
jury.
now,
in
this
instruction
the
word,
moral,
was
used
a
couple
of
times,
not
just
used
in
the
phrase,
moral
certainty.
earlier
the
judge
said,
"it
is
not
a
mere
possible
doubt,
because
everything
related
to
human
affairs
and
depending
on
moral
evidence
is
open
to
some
possible
or
imaginary
doubt.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
you
possibly
make
it
clearer
that
the
word,
moral,
means
pertaining
to
human
action?
what
do
you
think
the
jury
thought
moral
evidence
meant?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you,
but
you're
making
the
argument
that
the
only
meaning
this
jury
could
have
taken,
or
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
jury
took
moral
certainty
not
to
mean
that
degree
of
certainty
that...
which
is
the
highest
degree
we
can
have
in
matters
of
human
affairs--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i
say
that
it
is
very
likely
that
they
took
it
to
mean
that,
since
earlier
the
judge
refers
to
moral
evidence,
and
in
that
context
the
only
thing
it
could
have
meant
to
the
jury
is
evidence
relating
to
human
action,
and
moral
certainty
means
that
certainty
which
is
certainty
relating
to
human
action.
i
don't
know
why
you
can
just
pluck
out
the
use
of
moral
one
time
in
the
instruction
and
not
see
how
it
was
described
earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
relating
to
human
affairs,
everything
relating
to
human
affairs
and
depending
on
moral
evidence
is
open
to
some
possible
doubt,
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"you
must
be
convinced
to
a
moral
certainty.
"
my
goodness,
after
that
sentence
a
juror
should
understand
that
that's
what
he
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
moral
is
susceptible
to
both
meanings,
yes,
but
certainty
is
not
susceptible
of
both
meanings,
when
you
combine
the
word
moral
with
the
word
certainty,
it
means--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
highest
degree
of
assurance
you
can
have
in
matters
of
human
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
oed
gives
that
meaning.
i
thought
you
acknowledged
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
you
don't
count
that
as
a
dictionary.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
too
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
expense
of
current
american...
i
thought
they
gave
american
usage.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
purport
to
give
american
usage.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
purport
to
give
american
usage.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it
depends
on
the
context.
i
mean,
the
word
moral...
moral,
in
one
of
the
dictionaries
you
cite,
moral
is
defined
as
sexually
virtuous.
now,
i
don't
think
when
a
juror
in
this
context
hears
moral
certainty,
i
don't
think
the
juror
thinks
it
has
anything
to
do
with
being
sexually
virtuous.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
context
that
determines
its
meaning,
and
when
the
context
is
following
a
sentence
that
says,
everything
relating
to
human
affairs
and
depending
on
moral
evidence
is
open
to
some
possible
doubt,
and
therefore
you
must
have
a
moral
certainty,
i
think
that's
a
quite
different
context
from
just
coming
up
to
somebody
and
saying,
moral
certainty.
you'd
get
a
quite
different
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
boyde...
well,
never
mind.
that's
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
instead
of
dropping
it,
you
might
also
consider
the
possibility
of
having
a
campaign
to
use
the
term
properly
instead
of
using
it
as
a
slovenly
description
of
something
that
is
not
at
all
a
certainty,
far
from
certain.
it
is
often
use
that
way,
but
it's
probably
an
incorrect
use.
