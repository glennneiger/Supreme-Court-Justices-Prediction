mr.
mark
david
schneider
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
key
tronic
submits
that
the
federal
superfund
statute,
or
cercla,
authorizes
the
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees
by
private
parties
where
they
undertake
cleanup
and
then
take
steps
to
compel
others
to
participate
in
the
cost
of
the
cleanup.
cercla
section
107(a)(4)
provides
for
the
recovery
of
response
costs
by
parties.
the
term
101(25)
to
include
enforcement
activities.
where
a
party
imposes
the
liabilities
and
obligations
of
cercla
on
others
by
undertaking
cleanup
and
then
compelling
others
to
share
in
the
cost
of
cleanups,
those
actions
constitute
enforcement
activities
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
term
cercla
includes
attorneys'
fees
because
the
primary
enforcement
activity
in
the
context
of
section
101(25)
and
in
the
context
of
section
107
is
a
suit
to
impose
the
liabilities
and
obligations
of
cercla
on
parties
that
have
caused
environmental
contamination.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
yes,
justice
souter,
in
this
case
that
has
already
occurred.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
in
the
context
of
a
superfund,
justice
souter,
the
meaning
of
the
word
"enforcement
activities"
does
include
the
activities
of
a
private
party.
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
union
gas
decision,
epa
does
not
have
the
resources
to
engage
in
activities
at
all
of
the
sites
across
the
country,
and
so
congress
in
cercla
expressly
provided
for
and
encouraged
private
parties
to
engage
in
cleanup
and
then
to
bring
cost
recovery.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
no--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--no,
justice
souter.
the
citizens'
suit
provision
is
in
section
9659,
and
a
citizens'
suit
can
bring
an
action
to
compel
the
epa
to
act
if
there's
a
violation
of
a
standard.
section
107
provides
for
a
right
to
recover
response
costs.
the
definition
of
response
costs
is
defined
in
section
101(25),
and
section
101(25)
is
a
section
of
general
application.
it's
a
definitional
section
to
define
the
word
"response
cost".
a
response
cost
is
something
that
a
private
party
may
recover.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
yes,
justice
souter.
section
9659
provides
that
when
a
citizen
brings
a
"citizens'
suit
under
section
9659,
it
may
recover
its
attorneys
fees.
"
but
that
is
the
only
relief
that
a
citizens'
suit
plaintiff
can
recover.
in
cercla
section
1...
a
citizens'
suit
plaintiff
under
section
9659
does
not
have
the
ability
or
the
authority
to
bring
an
action
to
recover
response
costs.
that
is
limited--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--no,
justice
souter,
they
cannot.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
the
only
monetary
reimbursement
that
a
citizens'
suit
plaintiff
can
recover
under
section
9659
are
the
attorneys'
fees
enforcing
the
epa
to
act,
no
other
monetary
reimbursement.
in
contrast,
section
107,
which
is
an
action
for
cost
recovery,
which
applies
both
to
the
government
and
to
private
parties,
states
that
parties
can
recover
their
costs
of
response.
section
101(25)
specifically
defines
response
to
mean
enforcement
activities.
in
the
context
of
a
superfund
site,
the
primary
enforcement
activity
will
be
an
action
to
compel
other
parties,
pursuant
to
their
statutory
obligations,
to
pay
their
fair
share
of
cleanup
cost.
typically,
what
happens
is
one
party
will
undertake
cleanup
and
pay
for
the
entire
cost
of
the
cleanup.
that
party
will
then
bring
an
action
to
enforce
the
statute
to
compel
other
parties
who
are
also
liable
under
the
statute
to
pay
for
their
fair
share
of
the
cleanup
costs.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
that
would
be
an
enforcement
activity
if
that
nonliable
party
is
able
to
establish
that
the
other
parties
are
liable
under
the
statute
to
pay
portions
of
the
response
costs.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
no,
justice
kennedy.
the
only
relief
available
for
a
cost
recovery
plaintiff
is
to
recover
costs
that
have
been
spent
for
cleanup.
by
definition,
a
cost
recovery
case
under
section
107
requires
the
plaintiff,
whether
it's
the
government
or
a
private
party,
to
undertake
cleanup,
to
spend
response
costs,
and
then
bring
an
action
to
recover
those
costs.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
amendment
of
cercla
in
1986,
the
united
states
relied
on
section
104(b)
as
well
as
section
107
to
recover
the
costs
of
attorneys'
fees
in
bringing
these
types
of
actions.
prior
to
the
amendment
of
superfund
in
1986,
all
of
the
lower
courts
held
that
the
government
was
entitled
to
recover
its
fees
under
section
104(b)
as
well
as
under
section
107.
key
tronic
submits
that
if...
and
the
language
used
in
section
104
was
cost
of
legal
study
or
investigation.
key
tronic
submits
that
if
the
term
"cost
of
legal
study
or
investigation.
"
is
sufficiently
explicit
to
authorize
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees,
then
certainly
the
word
"enforcement
activities",
which
appears
in
the
section
of
general
application
to
both
private
parties
and
the
government,
also
is
entitled
to
recover
its
attorneys'
fees.
the
reason
that
an
enforcement
activity
includes
attorneys'
fees
is
because
the
primary
enforcement
activity
within
the
meaning
of
section
101(25)
and
section
107,
is
an
action
to
compel
other
parties
to
pay
their
share
of
cleanup
costs.
enforcement
activities
means
the
actions
that
are
undertaken
to
enforce
the
statute.
in
most
cases,
as
a
practical
matter
the
word...
the
activities
will
be
undertaken
by
attorneys,
and
so
the
most
logical
reading
of
the
phrase
"enforcement
activities"
includes
attorneys'
fees.
but
"enforcement
activities"
is
broader,
because
there
are
some
activities
that
will
be
undertaken
not
by
attorneys.
for--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--no,
that
is
not
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
cargill
case,
where
the
court
was
construing
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
the
court
characterized
a
private
action
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
as
a
private
enforcement
action.
in
the
alyeska
decision,
this
court
stated
that
congress
often
encourages
private
parties
to
act
by
awarding
attorneys'
fees,
and
that
will
allow
for
"private
enforcement
of
the
statute".
mr.
mark
david
schneider
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
under
the
clayton
act,
a
party
is
taking
steps
to
enforce
the
liabilities
against
those
parties
who
have
undertaken
activities
prohibited
by
the
antitrust
statute.
in
cercla,
the
word
"enforce"
is
used
to
enforce
the
liabilities
and
obligations
of
the
statute.
for
example,
in
cercla,
a
party
is
liable
if
it
arranges
for
the
disposal
of
hazardous
substances.
to
enforce
this
statute
in
the
context
of
section
101(25)
means
to
make
sure
that
that
party
that
arranged
for
the
disposal
of
hazardous
substances
pays
for
the
cost
of
cleanup.
in
the...
i
would
note
that
even
both
prior
to
the
amendment
of
superfund--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--off-hand,
justice
ginsburg,
i
cannot
think
of
another
example,
but
cercla
is
a
unique
statute
which
uses
the
word
101(25)
which
is
a
definitional
section.
it
says,
for
purposes
of
section
107,
in
defining
the
word
"response",
that
word
"response"
includes
the
words
"enforcement
activities".
the
reason
that
cercla
is
a
unique
statute
is
because
in
1986,
when
congress
amended
the
superfund
statute,
the
legislative
history
was
replete
with
references
as
to
what
an
utter
failure
the
superfund
program
had
been.
the
legislative
history
contains
many
references
explaining
that
epa
simply
was
unable
to
make
the
superfund
program
work
by
itself.
the
response,
congress
decided
to
fix
that
problem
by
giving
more
incentives
to
private
parties
to
act.
one
of
those
incentives
was
in
section
101(25),
enabling
private
parties
to
recover
their
costs
of
enforcement
activities
which
we
submit
includes
attorneys'
fees.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
unlike
virtually
any
other
statute,
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
exxon
decision
that
in
fact
it
is
an
inartful
statute,
but
what
congress
decided
to
do
in
superfund
was
to
make
sure
that
any
party,
whether
it
was
a
governmental
party
or
a
private
party,
whether
it
was
a
liable
party
or
a
nonliable
party,
any
party
that
undertook
cleanup
could
then
bring
an
action
to
recover
its
cost,
and
it
used
the
term
"enforcement
activity"
in
a
section
which
expressly
applies
to
any
party,
liable
or
nonliable,
governmental
party
or
private
party.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
justice
souter,
with
all
due
respect,
in
this
particular
case
key
tronic
acted...
well,
key
tronic
has
never
been
held
liable.
it
acted
voluntarily,
immediately
after
contamination
was
discovered,
but
what
congress
noted--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--no
action
had
been
brought.
it
started
its
actions
in
1980,
3
years
before
the
epa
was
involved,
10
years
before--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--justice
souter,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
would
support
that
statement,
but
regardless
of
what
happened
in
this
particular--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--we
don't
argue
that
it
would
have
been
free
of
liability,
but
a
case
was
never
brought.
what
congress
did,
though,
in
1986,
was
it
recognized
there
were
not
enough
key
tronics
in
the
world
to
make
the
superfund
process
work.
congress
in
1986
noted
that
epa
had
not
done
its
job.
it
was
simply
too
enormous
a
task
to
be
undertaken
by
epa
alone,
and
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
union
gas
decision.
congress
did
not
think
it
enough
to
give
the
tools
only
to
epa.
as
a
result,
it
also
encouraged
private
parties
to
act.
the
question,
justice
souter,
you
raised
as
to
what
does
the
public
get
as
a
result
of
this
cleanup,
what
the
public
gets
is
a
clean
site
that
might
otherwise
not
occur.
congress
had
two
goals
when
it
passed
the
superfund
statute.
one
of
the
goals
was
prompt...
making
sure
that
hazardous
waste
sites
were
prompoly
cleaned
up,
and
the
other
goal
was
to
make
sure
that
those
parties
that
caused
the
contamination
would
pay
for
the
contamination
costs
that
they
had
caused.
as
a
practical
matter,
congress
chose
as
its
mechanism
to
get
to
cleanup...
it
chose
to
arm
private
parties
and
the
government
with
extraordinary
abilities
to
enforce
the
superfund
statutes.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
justice
souter,
i
am
arguing
that
in
the
context
of--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--well,
it
is--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--absolutely,
and
the
reason
congress
used
the
word
enforcement
activities
"and
not"
attorneys'
fees
"is
because
the
enforcement
activities
could
include
the
actions
in
this
case,
for
example,
where
a
private
investigator
was
hired
to
do
the
gumshoe
work
to
find
out
who
disposed
of
hazardous
substances
at
the
corporate
landfill.
"
"the
cost--
"
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--yes,
justice
scalia,
it's
used
in
a
number
of
other
places
within
the
statute.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
the...
justice
scalia,
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
if
congress
had
wanted
only
to
give
the
right
of
attorneys'
fees
to
epa,
it
could
have
done
so
by
using
the
terms
epa...
for
example,
in
section
104(b)...
but
it
didn't
do
that.
it
could
have
put
the
right
to
recover
attorneys'
fees
or
enforcement
activity
costs
in
section
107(a)(4)(a),
which
applies
only
to
the
government,
but
it
didn't
do
that.
in
defining
the
term
101(25),
and
section
101(25)
defines
the
term
107(a)(4)(b)
of
cercla.
the
enforcement
activity
under
cercla
is
to
make
sure
that
those
parties
that
have
caused
contamination
will
pay
for
a
portion
of
the
cleanup
costs.
that's
consistent
with
the
common,
every-day
understanding
of
the
word
"enforce".
in
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
the
position
that
a
party
wants
to
enforce
its
rights...
that
doesn't
require
governmental
action...
or
that
there's
an
enforceable
contract.
that
doesn't
require
enforceable
action.
this
court's
decision
in
the
alyeska
case
and
in
the
union
gas
case,
both
refer
to
the
word
"enforcement"
without
any
consideration
of
governmental
involvement.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
use
of
the
word
"enforcement"
in
the
superfund
statute
has
to
include
attorneys'
fees.
now,
the
united
states...
well,
maybe
i
should
take
a
step
back.
key
tronic's
argument
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
the
phrase,
101(25).
prior
to
1986,
the
word
"response"
meant
environmental
investigation,
technical
services,
cleanup
activities.
prior
to
the
amendment
in
1986,
all
of
the
lower
courts
had
held
that
the
epa
was
already
entitled
to
recover
its
attorneys'
fees.
in
1986,
congress
put
the
word
101(25),
which
is
a
definitional
section
of
general
application.
since
prior
to
the
amendments,
the
phrase
had...
since
prior
to
the
amendments,
the
epa
was
already
entitled
to
recover
its
attorneys'
fees,
and
since
congress
put
it
in
a
section
of
general
application--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--yes.
that's
section
101(25)
of
the
superfund
statute.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
that's--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--that's
correct,
and
we
expressly
rely
on
the
new
language
which
was
added,
the
words
"enforcement
activities".
that's
the
language
we
rely
on
in
order
to
establish
that
congress
intended
both
the
government
and
private
parties
to
recover
fees.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
in
this
case
an
action
to
reallocate
cost
among
liable
parties
is
related
to
a
removal
action.
it's
related
in
the
sense--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--well,
congress
used
the
word
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
mr.
chief
justice,
congress
used
the
word
"related"
in
the
common,
ordinary
use
of
the
term
"related",
meaning
does
it
pertain
to,
does
it
relate
to
an
action
to
reallocate
cost
of
cleanup,
does
it
relate
to
the
cleanup.
but
there's
a
second
argument
that
we
raise,
and
that
is,
actions
to
reallocate
costs
among
liable
parties
will
directly
lead
to
cleanup,
and
the
reason
it
will
lead
to
cleanup,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
because
if
private
parties
know
that
they
can
undertake
cleanup,
spend
the
money,
spend
far
more
than
their
fair
share
of
the
cleanup
costs,
and
then
get
a
portion
of
those
costs
and
attorneys'
fees
back
from
other
parties,
they
are
far
more
likely
in
the
first
place
to
undertake
cleanup.
and
so
the
use
of
the
word
"related"
we
submit
has
a
very
broad
meaning,
but
even
if
one
used
a
very
narrow
meaning,
congress
decided
that
the
mechanism
to
get
to
cleanup
was
to
allow
private
parties
as
well
as
the
government
to
enforce
the
statute.
if
i
could
respond
to
the
question
of
justice
souter,
the
united
states
argues
that
enforcement
activities
is
something
that
only
the
epa
can
conduct,
but
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
structure
or
the
language
of
the
statute
supports
that
argument.
cercla
expressly
provides
that
any
party,
whether
it's
a
governmental
party
or
a
private
party,
may
undertake
response
action,
and
as
this
court
noted
in
the
union
gas
decision,
epa
cannot
address
all
of
the
sites
across
the
country.
here,
as
a
result,
congress
expressly
provided
for
and
it
encouraged
private
parties
to
act.
here,
key
tronic
did
precisely
the
same
things
that
the
epa
does
when
it
does
enforcement
activities.
key
tronic
did
an
environmental
investigation,
it
prepared
the
cleanup
plan,
it
performed
a
search
for
potentially
responsible
parties,
it
sued
the
air
force,
which
was
ultimately
held
liable,
and
then
the
air
force
finally
paid.
these
are
precisely
the
same
steps
that
the
epa
takes
when
it
undertakes
enforcement
activities.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
yes.
key...
there
were
two
phases
of
cleanup,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
early
phases,
before
the
epa
got
involved,
key
tronic
did
the
environmental
investigation,
it
provided
bottled
water,
it
provided
a
new
water
main
so
that
residents
living
near
the
landfill
would
not
be
exposed
to
that.
they
also
did,
as
i
understand
it,
some
excavation
measures,
but
the
real
long-term
cleanup
occurred
once
the...
after
key
tronic
prepared
the
consent
decree
which
set
forth
the
remedy
in
the
case,
that
as
the
long-term
cleanup,
and
the
long-term
cleanup,
and
it's
going
on
today,
is
to
pump
the
groundwater
out
of
the
water...
pump
the
contamination
out
of
the
groundwater,
and
to
treat
it.
that
long-term
cleanup
occurred,
as
the
district
court
found,
because
key
tronic
acted
to
prepare
the
consent
decree.
we
hired
the
scientists
who
prepared
the
work
plan.
key
tronic
hired
the
lawyers
who
wrote
the
consent
decree
which
set
forth
the
cleanup
plan
that
epa
ultimately
adopted,
and
which
the
air
force
belatedly
contributed
to.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
no.
unfortunately,
congress--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
justice
stevens,
it
does
not
relate
to
section
106.
section
106
allows
the
epa
to
seek
injunctive
relief.
section
107
is
what
gave
the
authority
to
key
tronic
to
recover
its
cost,
and
it
gives--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--justice
stevens,
the
only
answer
i
can
get
is,
every
court
has
considered
this
statute
and
says
that
the
authority
to
bring
a
private
action
comes
under
section
107.
it's
a
very
in--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--well,
congress...
every
court
has
held
it's
an
express
cause
of
action.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
maybe
i
could
take
a
step
back.
the
private...
if
a
party
seeks
to
recover
the
cost
it
has
spent,
the
only
mechanism
it
has,
or
the
only
mechanism
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
section
107,
which
applies
to
both
epa
and
to
private
parties
like
key
tronic.
justice
stevens,
you
are
correct,
the
words
do
not
appear
in
section
107(a),
which
would
expressly
authorize
that,
but
all
of
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
private
parties,
when
they
seek
to
recover
their
cost
under
section
107,
that's
their
authority,
and
that
applies
both
to
the
government,
and
it
also
applies
to
private
parties.
section
106,
which,
justice
stevens,
you
have
referred
to,
allows
the
epa
to
seek
injunctive
relief,
or
to--
mr.
mark
david
schneider
--in
the
event
that
the
epa
has
authorized
the
state
agency
to
act,
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
that's
correct,
justice.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
david
schneider
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
government
contrasts
the
citizens'
suit
provision,
which
uses
the
word
"attorneys'
fees",
with
the
cost
recovery
provision,
which
uses
the
word
"enforcement
activities".
the
reason
congress
chose
the
word
10125
is
because
it's
broader
than
attorneys'
fees,
to
encompass
the
costs
of...
incurred
in
enforcing
the
statute
which
are
not
incurred
by
attorneys;
for
example,
private
investigator
costs.
the
government
draws
a
distinction
between
the
fees
that
might
be
awarded
when
a
party
is
not
liable
versus
the
fees
that
might
be
awarded
when
a
party
is
liable.
there's
no
basis
for
that
distinction
in
the
statute.
nothing
in
the
language
or
the
structure
of
the
statute
supports
that
distinction.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
that
distinction
does
not
make
sense
in
the
superfund
context,
because
superfund
imposes
liability
on
virtually
any
party
which
is
even
remotely
associated
with
the
contamination.
in
fact,
in
many,
if
not
most
of
the
cases
that
epa
brings
against...
that
the
united
states
brings
against
one
or
two
private
parties,
it's
the
united
states
department
of
defense
which
is,
in
many
cases,
the
largest
polluter
at
that
particular
site.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
10125
includes
attorneys'
fees.
we
agree.
the
government
has
contended
that
the
language
in
section
10125
confirmed
epa's
right
to
recover
fees.
we
agree,
but
congress
put
that
language
of
10125,
which
was
a
section
of
general
application,
not
one
that
applied
only
to
the
united
states.
thank
you.
