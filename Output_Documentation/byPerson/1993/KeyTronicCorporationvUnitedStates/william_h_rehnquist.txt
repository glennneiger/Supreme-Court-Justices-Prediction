chief

h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-376,
key
tronic
corporation
v.
united
states.
mr.
schneider.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government's
right
to
recover
attorneys'
fees
comes
from
still
a
different
section,
doesn't
it,
under
the
legal
studies
section?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
subsection
(25)
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
way
the
section...
that
(25)
starts
out,
the
term
"respond"
or
"response"
means
"remove",
"removal",
"remedy",
and
"remedial
action".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
you
wouldn't
think
lawyers
were
much
good
for
cleaning
up
waste,
or
cleaning
up
a
mess.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
"respond"
and
"response"
and
"remove"
now
mean...
now
include
enforcement
activities
relating
to
removal
or
remedies.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
rather
attenuated,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it...
it's
a
word
that
could
have
a
broad
meaning
or
it
could
have
a
narrow
meaning,
depending
on
how
one
defines
it.
certainly
it
doesn't
just
spring
to
one's
thoughts
immediately
that
there's
that
connection
that
you
say.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
key
tronic
itself
arrange
to
have
any
of
the
cleanup
done?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
schneider.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
might
say
it
was
building
inference
upon
inference.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
unusual
for
the
government
to
be
authorized
by
statute
to
recover
its
attorneys'
fees
against
someone
it's
litigating
with?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can't
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
may
not
be
if
none
of
them
can
recover
their
attorneys'
fees.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
schneider,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schneider.
the
case
is
submitted.
