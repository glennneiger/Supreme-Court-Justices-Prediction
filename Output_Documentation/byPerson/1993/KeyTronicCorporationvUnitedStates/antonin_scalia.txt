justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
quite
different.
i
mean,
the
sherman
act
situation,
you're
talking
about
a
party
who's
been
injured
going
after
the
wrongdoer.
that's
quite
a
different
situation
from
one
wrongdoer
who
has
been
compelled
to
cough
up
the
entire
compensation
for
the
wrong
going
after
another
wrongdoer
to
get
back
some
of
what
he's
paid.
that
seems
to
me
not...
i
would
not
normally
call
that
enforcement.
i
would
call
it
contribution.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schneider,
is
the
term
107(4)?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
your
argument
would
be
a
lot
stronger
if
the
only
place
in
which
the
term
occurred
was
in
this
provision,
because
then
that
specification
that
it
includes
enforcement
activities
would
have
to
be
referring
to
this
section,
but
if
it
appears
elsewhere,
there
might
well
be
what
justice
souter
and
i
would
call
genuine
enforcement
activities,
in
other
sections
that
are
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
you
acknowledged
a
bit
earlier
that
it's
unusual,
if
not,
indeed,
unique,
for
the
federal
government
to
be
awarded
its
attorneys'
fees.
is
it
not
also
unusual
and
perhaps
unique
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
recover
its
enforcement
costs,
apart
from
attorneys'
fees?
do
you
know
of
any
other
statute
that
lets
the
government
get
its--
justice
antonin
scalia
--enforcement
costs?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i'm
trying
to
help
you,
mr.
wallace.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
will
say,
you
know,
just
as
well...
you
may
it
is
unusual
to
get
attorneys'
fees,
but
it's
also
unusual
to
get
enforcement
costs.
in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
often
help
you,
mr.
wallace.
[laughter]
