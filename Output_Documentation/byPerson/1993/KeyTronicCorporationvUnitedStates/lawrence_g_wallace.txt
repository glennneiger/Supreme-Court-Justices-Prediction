mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
do
not
contest
that
there
is
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
9607
to
recover
contribution
of
costs.
and
that
was
confirmed
by
congress
in
adding
a
contribution
provision
in
the
1986
amendments
in
9613,
but
that
does
not
itself
provide
the
cause
of
action;
it
provides
guidelines
for
the
cause
of
action.
and
key
tronic
has
been
paid
its
costs
of
the
cleanup.
the
issue
here
is
its
claim
for
attorneys'
fees,
not
for
other
costs.
and
if
i
may
just
amend
one
other
factual
point
in
petitioner's
response
to
a
question,
we
do
refer
to
a
consent
decree
that
key
tronic
entered
into
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
and
the
top
of
page
4
in
our
brief.
now,
they
did
not
explicitly
admit
liability,
but
they
entered
the
consent
decree
which
recounted
actions
that
would
have
made
them
liable
under
cercla
and
actions
of
depositing
hazardous
wastes
at
the
site,
and
this
is
consistent
also
with
a
jury
trial
that
was
earlier
reached
on
the
complaint
of
some
neighbors
that
we
refer
to
in
footnote
2
of
our
brief.
so
there
has
been
some
adjudications
with
respect
to
liability.
now,
the...
in
our
view,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
rule
of
this
court's
decisions
in
alyeska
and
runyon
against
mccrary,
which
hold
that
under
the
american
rule
there
has
to
be
explicit
authorization
for
the
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees.
and
in
runyon
against
mccrary
in
particular,
there
was
an
effort
by
the
plaintiffs
to
rely
on
what
they
argued
was
an
implicit
authorization
and
a
broadly
granted...
a
broadly
worded
grant
of
remedial
authority,
and
the
court
said,
no,
it
has
to
be
an
explicit
authorization
for
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees.
petitioner's
claim
here
is...
rests
on
a
request
that
the
court
build
an
inference
upon
an
inference
from
the
statutory
language
on
which
the
petitioner
relies,
and
that
does
not
meet
the
standard.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
an
explicit
reference
to
legal
costs
incurred
by
the
government.
not...
that
is
in
section
104(b),
and
we
quote
it
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
13
and
the
top
of
page
14
of
our
brief.
and
it's
the
interplay
of
sections,
including
this
one,
which
is
the
only
one
that
the
government
can
rely
on
as
explicitly
referring
to
legal
costs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
they
would
enjoy
that...
the
fees
under
the
same
provision
because
they
act
only
by
delegation
from
us
with
respect
to
a
particular
site.
when
epa,
which
has
delegated
authority
from
the
president,
turns
over
the
lead
responsibility
at
a
particular
site
to
the
local
or--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
not
as
ideal
as
we
would
wish
it
but,
of
course,
that
is
not
the
question
at
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
at
least...
at
least
there
is
a
reference
to
costs
of
attorneys
explicit
in
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
understand
that
this
language
is
not
ideal
as
a
starting
point
for
our
own
purposes.
it
was
construed
by
the
lower
courts
to
authorize
epa
to
recover
attorneys'
fees,
and
that
was
really
reconfirmed,
in
our
view,
in
the
sara
amendments
which
added
the
words
"enforcement
activities".
but
the
question
in
the
case
is
not
epa's
right
to
recover;
the
question
is
petitioner's
right
to
recover.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
been
sensitive
to
that
problem
in
the
way
we
have
briefed
this
case,
i
can
assure
you,
mr.
justice.
[laughter]
it
has
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion.
nonetheless,
we
can't
responsibly
ask
the
court
to
resolve
that
issue
in
this
case,
which
doesn't
involve
that
question.
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
certainly
fits
in
well
with
that,
but
we
don't
think
it's
limited
to
that
because
it...
the
statutory
phrase
doesn't
end
there.
it
says
as
it
may
deem
necessary,
appropriate
to...
and/or
appropriate
to
plan
and
direct
response
actions.
and
that
includes
enforcement
activities
in
our
view,
that
could
include
litigation
as...
but
it
is
not
ideally
drafted,
from
our
standpoint.
nonetheless,
there
has
been
a
course
of
judicial
decision
upholding
epa's
and
the
environment
division's
ability
to
recover
these
fees
as
part
of
its
enforcement
activities,
and
we
think
congress
built
upon
that
in
the
sara
amendments,
in
adding
that
reference
to
"enforcement
activities".
but
to
get
back
to
this
case,
petitioner
has
to...
in
order
for
its
view
to
prevail,
it
has
to
have
two
inferences...
not
just
one
of
the
two,
but
both
of
them
drawn
in
petitioner's
favor.
and
the
first
inference
is
that
enforcement
activities
standing
alone,
without
the
support,
such
as
it
is,
of
this
reference,
at
least,
to
legal
activities,
would
be
a
reference
to
attorneys'
fees
explicit
enough
to
meet
the
standard
of
alyeska
and
runyon.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course,
our
view
is
that
they
don't
include
anything
for
a
private
party;
that's
the
second
inference.
but
if
there
isn't
agreement
on
that,
then
we
would
think
that
it
would
perhaps
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
course.
of
course.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
don't
dispute
that.
we
think
that
enforcement--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
most
direct
things
involved
are
the
studies
and
nonlitigation
attorney
time
that
would
have
to
be
involved
in
arranging
for
the
cleanup.
you're
entering
into
contracts
with
the
landfill
companies
and
others
who--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
don't
think
that
"enforcement
activities"
refers
to
that.
we
think
"enforcement
activities"
refers
only
to
the
government.
but
we
do
think
that
those
are
appropriate
response
costs
by
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--private
person
undertaking
the
cleanup
activities.
the
line
that
we
think
is
drawn--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
that
was
being
contested
in
litigation
and
this
was
a
way
of
reconfirming
that
epa
would
have
that
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
can't,
because
we
don't
think
enforcement
activities
applies
to
activities
by
private
parties.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
the...
i
think
it
would
be
redundant
of
what
they
could
already
recover
as
responses.
and
it
was
put
in,
as
the
house
report
indicated...
we've
quoted
it
right
in
the
middle
of
page
23
of
our
brief...
that
this
refers...
"this
section
also
modifies
the
definition
of
response
action
to
include
related
enforcement
activities.
"
"the
change
will
confirm
the
epa's
authority
to
recover
costs
for
enforcement
actions
taken
against
responsible
parties.
"
it
was
government
enforcement
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
making
this
change--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the...
it's...
there's
a
complicated
accounting
method
that's
used
that
attributes
time
spent
by
the
hourly
wages
and
fringe
benefits
that
the
attorneys
get--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--on
particular
sites,
plus
what
would
be
regarded
as
an
overhead
factor,
according
to
proper
accounting
methods.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
can't
think
of
any
other
example
in
particular.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
not
correct
to
think
of
this
as
a
disparity
between
the
government
and
private
parties.
what
were--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
there...
there...
the
litigation
in
this
area
typically
proceeds
in
stages.
there
is
an
initial
stage
to
accomplish
the
cleanup,
and
that
is
typically
brought
not
against
all
of
the
potentially
responsible
parties;
there
can
be
scores
or
even
hundreds
of
those,
many
of
which
are
relatively
small
factors.
it's
brought
against
somebody
who's
a
major
factor,
who
can
be
depended
upon...
or
maybe
two
or
three
who
can
be
depended
upon
to
get
the
cleanup
done,
and
there
are
certain
time
bars
that
prevent
other
litigation
from
going
forward
until
cleanups
are
accomplished.
and
then
the
second
stage
of
litigation,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
in
these
contribution
actions,
is
litigation
in
which
these
people
who
were
jointly
and
severally
liable
and
who
tend
to
be
relatively
strong
litigants
and
relatively
well-to-do,
can
seek
contribution
from
a
large
number
of
other
potentially
responsible
parties
who
may
be
much
smaller
contributors
to
the
site.
and
there
tends
to
be
a
considerable
disparity
of
bargaining
power
between
the
litigants
in
these
contribution
actions
to
begin
with,
because
the
ones
who
are
going
to
become
the
plaintiffs
were
selected
because
of
their
ability
clean
up
the
site
in
the
first
place.
and
that
disparity
in
bargaining
power
can
be
considerably
exacerbated
in
some
cases
if
there
is
also
the
potential
liability
for
attorneys'
fees.
i'm
not
saying
that
congress
had
this
in
mind
and
made
a
conscious
decision
to
bar
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees
in
the
contribution
litigation,
but
i'm
pointing
out
that
congress
was
aware
of
these
underlying
problems.
and
one
of
the
less
admired
aspects
of
the
implementation
of
cercla,
that
the
so-called
transaction
costs...
which
is
a
word
that
has
become
part
of
the
lexicon
of
environmental
law,
the
costs
of
litigation
and
of
studies,
the
costs
that
are
not
directly
involved
in
the
cleanup
itself...
have
been
soaring.
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--so
long
as
the
pollution
has
become
mixed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
has
not...
is
not
severable
within
the
site,
and
that
they're
jointly
and
severally
liable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
can
get
contribution
for
its
cleanup,
but
we're
of
the
view
that
it
cannot
get
contribution
for
its
attorney
costs
for
either
trying
to
resist
its
liability
to
epa
or
for
trying
to
find
out
who
else
were
the
contributors--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
getting
the
contribution.
because
those
costs
can
soar
a
good
deal,
and
can--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--perhaps
so,
but
considerable
budgetary
adjustments
would
have
to
be
made
in
order
for
federal
enforcement
to
be
able
to
proceed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are
fee
statutes
in
some
agencies
that
require
applicants
for
licenses
to
bear
what
amounts
to
the
government's
costs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they're
not
really
enforcement
costs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
guess
that
would
be
true.
we
haven't
really
given
thought
to
analogies
of
that
kind
because
the
case
before
the
court
is
not
about
the
government's
ability
to
recover.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
certainly
is
an
unusual--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
user
fees.
it
certainly
is
unusual,
to
get
a
little
closer
to
home
here...
and
i
appreciate
all
of
these
thoughts,
but
to
get
a
little
closer
to
home--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
should
welcome
it
when
it
occurs.
it
certainly
is
unusual
for
attorneys'
fees
to
be
available
in
contribution
actions.
this
is
not
the
common
law
rule,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
contribution
provision
itself
says
that
it
will
be
governed...
that
contribution
will
be
governed
by
federal
law,
and
the
federal
common
law
rule
is
the
rule
of
alyeska
and
of
runyon
against
mccrary,
that
in
the
absence
of
explicit
authorization
there
should
be
no
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees.
now,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
resolve
whether
it
would
be
more
desirable
or
less
desirable
for
attorneys'
fees
recoveries
to
be
available
in
contribution
actions,
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
decided
to
bar
the
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees.
what
i
do
think
is
that
the
line
that
we
see
between
actions
that
are
taken
to
remedy
the
pollution
and
assure
that
a
polluter...
rather
than
the
public...
who
is
jointly
and
severally
liable
will
bear
the
cost...
the
line
between
that
and
reallocating
costs
among
polluters
is
a
very
rational
line.
and
it
is
rational
in
terms
of
considerations
the
congress
was
aware
of
in
the
course
of
considering
this
legislation,
and
i
want
to
just
refer
very
briefly
to
a
couple
of
indications
of
that.
not
because
i
say
that
congress
explicitly
resolved
it,
because...
but
because
i
think
it
shows
the
wisdom
of
applying
the
alyeska
rule
here,
that
congress
could
have
rationally
not
wanted
to
proceed
that
far.
and
one
is
in
the
senate
committee
report
which
accompanied
the
1986
amendments,
and
the
committee
says
that
responsible
sites
often
involve
dozens
or
even
hundreds
of
potentially
responsible
parties
with
differing
types
and
degrees
of
involvement
with
the
release.
while
the
government
may
sue
all
potentially
responsibilities,
it
need
not
sue
all
these
parties;
it
may
instead
sue
a
limited
number
of
parties
to
secure
a
complete
cleanup
or
all
costs
of
cleanup
under
the
principle
of
joint
and
several
liability.
generally
the
government
seeks
to
obtain
complete
cleanup.
in
some
instances
where
the
government
has
sued
major
contributors
of
hazardous
substances
to
a
site
but
not
lessor
contributors,
the
parties
named
by
the
united
states
have,
in
turn,
sued
other
potentially
responsible
parties
in
the
same
judicial
action.
in
several
cases
this
has
resulted
in
massive
and
potentially
unmanageable
litigation.
there
is
an
amicus
brief
filed
in
our
support
in
this
case
by
a
group
called
sand
springs
superfund
prp
group,
which
claims
to
be
put
upon
in
this
way,
mostly
because
of
claims
for
attorneys'
fees
that
are
being
made
against
it.
i
can't
vouch
for
the
accuracy
of
what
they
say,
but
it's
an
example
of
the
kinds
of
complaints
that
have
been
made.
then
on...
in
supporting
the
conference
report
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
senator
simpson,
who
was
a
member
of
the
conference
committee,
pointed
out
to
his
colleagues:
"there
is
not
doubt
that
the
immense
transaction
costs
generated
under
superfund,
meaning
lawyers'
fees
and
the
many
technical
and
scientific
studies
required
in
litigation,
have
come
to
symbolize
the
worst
excesses
of
the
american
legal
system.
"
"senator
domenici
quoted
dickens'
bleak
house
in
describing
it
last
year,
and
he
was
right.
"
"we
simply
must
work
to
have
more
societal
resources
spent
on
necessary
and
effective
cleanup
of
superfund
sites
and
less
on
convoluted
litigation
which
merely
extends
any
public
health
threat
that
exists
from
these
sites.
"
there
are
plausible
reasons
why
congress
might
have
wanted
to
draw
the
line
that
we
think
emerges
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
reasons
why
there
might
have
been
concern
that
settlements
that
might
be
encouraged
were
attorneys'
fees
available
in
the
contribution
phase
of
the
litigation,
might
sometimes
be
in
terrorem
settlements
rather
than
something
that
would
move
the
litigation
along
in
a
fair
and
just
manner.
in
any
event,
when
the
provisions
on
which
petitioner
relies
are
contrasted
with
the
explicit
provisions
made
for
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees...
and
i
realize
that
these
create
some
difficulties
for
us
as
well,
but
not
as
much.
and
we've
set
forth
the
citizens'
suit
provision
on
page
13
of
our
brief...
justice
souter
was
asking
about
it
earlier...
where
section
310(f)
of
cercla
provides
that
a
court,
quote,
may
award
costs
of
litigation,
including
reasonable
attorney
and
expert
witness
fees,
to
the
prevailing
or
the
substantially
prevailing
party
whenever
the
court
deems
such
an
award
appropriate.
this
is
far
different--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
still
is
a
rather
striking
difference
in
statutory
drafting,
and
this
provision
was
added
at
the
same
time
in
the
1986
amendments
that
the
reference
to
enforcement
activities
was
added,
which
certainly
makes
no
explicitly
reference
to
attorneys'
fees.
and
then
we
refer
later
in
the
same
paragraph
to
section
110(c)
of
cercla,
which
also
is
an
explicit
attorneys'
fees
provision.
so
we
think
that
there
simply
is
not
a
sufficiently
clear...
there's
too
much
ambiguity
in
resting
on
the
double
inferences
that
petitioner
asks
the
court
to
draw,
to
meet
the
standards
of
alyeska
and
runyon.
and
as
we've
explained
in
the
concluding
pages
of
our
brief,
the
request
for
nonlitigation
attorneys'
fees
really
should
be
evaluated
under
the
same
standard;
whether
these
were
office
costs
devoted
to
securing
a
remedy
and
actually
doing
the
cleanup
or
whether
they
were
office
costs
devoted
to
reallocating
the
costs
among
consumers.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
