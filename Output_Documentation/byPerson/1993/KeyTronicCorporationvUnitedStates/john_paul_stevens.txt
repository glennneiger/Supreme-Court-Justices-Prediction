justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i'm
just
trying
to
piece
this
statute
together
as
in
your
brief.
9607
is
the
liability
provision,
and
it
describes
in
subsection
4
any
person,
and
so
forth,
shall
be
liable.
now
the
"any
person"
we're
referring
to
in
this
case
is
the
air
force,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(b),
"for
any
other
necessary
costs
of
response
incurred
by
any
other
person.
"
and
that's
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
now,
does
the...
where
does
the
source
of
your
action
against
the
air
force
come
from?
is
it
in
9606?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i...
let
me
just
get
the
whole
thought
out
so
you
can
explain
what
my
problem...
i
read
9607
as
describing
the
liability
that
may
be
incurred
in
actions
authorized
by
9606...
it
follows
the
next
one...
and
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
the
private
cause
of
action
under
9659
wasn't
relevant
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
it
relates
to
9606,
why
does
it
authorize
payments
to
you?
that's
what
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
there's
no
provision
in
9607
authorizing
the
cause
of
action
by
key
tronic
against
the
air
force,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
an
implied
cause
of
action
we're
talking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
makes
it
wrong.
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
how
it
fits
into
the
statutory--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--doesn't
it
also
authorize
action
by
state
agencies
in
some
situations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
basically,
they're
governmental
enforcement
actions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
don't
include
attorneys'
fees,
what
do
they
include
when
private
parties
are...
just
investigators
and
stenographers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
you
can't...
you
can't
really
plausibly
argue
that
costs
of
response
do
not
include
enforcement
activity.
that's
the
only
thing
that's
clear
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
in
section
25.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
response
includes
enforcement
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
disputing
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
if
you
don't
dispute
that,
what
is
it
that
enforcement
activities
includes,
other
than
attorneys'
fees,
when
you're
talking
about
private
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
acknowledge
that
is
covered
in
a
private
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
private
party.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
wallace...
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt...
but
the
enforcement
action,
that's
you
recovering
government
counsel's
attorneys'
fees,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
they
compute
those?
how
do
they
compute
government
counsel's
attorneys'
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
on
an
hourly
basis
as
if
market
value,
like
we
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
you
help
me
out?
i
reveal
my
ignorance
about
the
whole
program,
but
is
it
the
fact...
you
mentioned
the
deep-pocket
person
who's
given
responsibility.
is
it
true
that
if
you
have...
say
three
companies
contributed
to
pollution
of
a
particular
site
and
the
very
large
company
was
only
75
percent
responsible
for
the
pollution,
can
that
large
company
be
made
to
pay
100
percent
of
the
costs
and
then
seek
contribution
from
the
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
the
costs
that
it
has
to
recover
because
it
had
to
pay
in
the
first
place
include
not
only
the
physical
costs
of
the
actual
engineering
and
so
forth,
but
also
the
costs
that
it
had
to
pay
to
the
government
for
its
enforcement
activities.
that's
part
of
what
it
then
seeks
contribution
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
bringing
contribution
actions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
the
total
amount
in
dispute
would
be
significantly
reduced
if
we
followed
the
american
rule
across
the
board?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--enforcing
violations
of
the
law,
i'm
talking
about.
well,
your
civil
penalty
statutes
often
do
this,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
that
i
have
to
announce,
key
tronic
corporation
against
the
united
states,
arises
out
of
the
dispute
between
two
of
the
parties
responsible
for
pollution
of
a
landfill
site
in
the
state
of
washington.
both
key
tronic
and
the
united
states
air
force
dump
liquid
chemicals
in
the
landfill.
in
litigation
with
the
washington
state
department
of
ecology
and
the
federal
environmental
protection
agency,
key
tronic
agreed
to
contribute
over
$4
million
to
the
cost
of
cleaning
up
the
site.
in
this
action,
key
tronic
seeks
to
recover
a
significant
portion
of
those
costs
from
the
united
states
air
force
because
it
was
also
partially
responsible
for
the
pollution.
the
specific
question
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
in
such
an
action
one
responsible
party
may
recover
its
attorney's
fees
from
another.
the
amount
at
issue
is
approximately
$1.2
million
for
fees
that
covered
three
different
types
of
services:
first,
the
identification
of
other
potentially
responsible
parties,
including
the
air
force,
that
was
liable
for
the
pollution;
second,
the
preparation
and
negotiation
of
a
settlement
agreement
with
the
epa;
and
finally,
that
fees
incurred
in
the
prosecution
of
this
litigation.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
fees
of
the
first
of
those
three
types
of
services
are
recoverable
but
the
others
are
not.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in
part
in
which
he
has
joined
by
justice
blackmun
and
justice
thomas.
