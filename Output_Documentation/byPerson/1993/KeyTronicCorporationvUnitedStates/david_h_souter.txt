justice
david
h.
souter
because
that
has
already
occurred,
hasn't
it,
prior
to
the
stage
that
we're
dealing
with
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
may
have...
indeed,
have
occurred
because
of
action
commenced
by
non-government
parties,
but
there's
sort
of
an
obvious
reference
to
them
as
enforcers
in
the
citizens'
suit
provision,
so
it's
not,
on
the
face
of
it,
obvious
that
a
person
in
the
position
of
your
client
is
enforcing
as
opposed
simply
to
spreading
the
burden
of
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
citizens'
suit
provision.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
i
should
know
the
answer
to
this,
but
i
don't.
is
there
a
separate
counsel
fee
provision
for
citizens'
suits?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
they
get
investigators'
fees,
and
so
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
strictly
limited
to
counsel.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
want
us
to
construe
the
term
under
the
policy
of
the
amendments,
which
was
to
induce
private
parties
to
act.
as
i
understand
it,
no
one
has
an
inducement
to
act
under
the
circumstances
that
your
client
acted
unless
that
person
has
already
been
found
liable
and
otherwise,
as
justice
scalia
said,
would
have
to
pay
the
whole
tab,
so
that
the
public
as
a
practical
matter
gets
nothing
from
the
recovery
that
you
want.
the
problem
has
been
identified,
someone
has
been
made
liable,
and
somebody's
got
to
pay
the
bill,
and
i
don't
see
why
congress
had
any
reason
to
induce
this
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
didn't
contest
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'll
grant
you
that,
but
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
basically
what
your
client
was
doing
was
essentially
what
might
be
called
a
preemptive
strike?
i
mean,
ultimately,
what
it
wanted
to
ensure
was
that
it
would
not
end
up
paying
the
whole
bill.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
else
was
it
doing
it?
i
mean,
it
has
not
contested
liability.
you
don't
argue
here
that
it
would
have
been
free
of
liability,
and
what
else
was
it
doing?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
implicitly
arguing,
i
guess,
that
two
pockets
are
better
than
one,
and
that's
what
the
public
gets.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
i
don't
think
is
a
bad
argument,
having
just
made
it
myself.
[laughter]
i
mean,
but
isn't
that
sort
of
what...
the
point
that
you're
making?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
public
does
get
something,
because
it
gets
another
pocket
to
go
after
if
the
first
one
is
not
full
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that's...
excuse
me,
but
that's
not
specifically
what
it
says.
it
refers
to
costs
of
legal
and
other
studies.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
to
speak
of
a
cost
of
a
legal
study
as
being
the
way
to
recover
attorneys'
fees
is
a
very
odd
use
of
language.
i
mean,
it's
not
only
a
question
of
inference;
it's
a
question
of
sort
of
wrenching,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
but
if
epa
is
resting
on
a
thin
reed
and
you
knock
out
the
other
block
you
might
rest
on,
the
next
case
might
be
an
expensive
one.
