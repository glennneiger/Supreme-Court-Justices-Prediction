justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
if
a
party
does
not
think
it's
liable
at
all,
but
thinks
that
parties
a,
b,
and
c
are?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
does
he
bring
a
suit
other
than
for
money?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so,
mr.
wallace,
you
can't
give
us
an
example
of
an
enforcement
activity
applicable
to
a
private
party
that
is
not
also
covered
as...
in
the
term
"response".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
if
it
did,
what...
you
say
it's
just
an
empty
set.
