doesn't
the
word
"enforcement
action"...
"enforcement
activities"
usually
refer
to
government
action,
action
by
government
agencies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
give
another
example
of
a
federal
statute
where
enforcement
action,
or
enforcement
activity,
is...
the
actor
is
someone
who
is
himself
liable
for
violating
some
prescriptions
of
the
statute,
who
has
a
liability
as
distinguished
from
someone
who
is
either
a
private
attorney
general
or
has
been
injured
in
fact
and
is
bringing
a
claim
against
a
wrongdoer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
may
i
ask
you
if
the
word
"legal
studies",
maybe
that
fits
in
more
with
the
tenth
circuit
kind
of
inbetween
decision
of
this
case;
no
litigation
fees,
but
other
legal
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
about
the
argument
that
enforcement
activities
would
be
redundant
because
the
epa
was
already
getting
its...
those
costs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
were
referring
to
statutes
that
have
user
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
schneider
said
that
that's
all
you
get
under
citizens...
it's
the
only...
there's
nothing...
no
other
category
that
this
can
be
placed
under,
as
distinguished
from
the
cleanup
recovery.
