excuse
me,
what
is
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
congress
can
treat
the
two
differently?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
domestic
company
is
here
which
normally
gives
primary
tax
authority
to
the
country
in
which
the
parent
is
formed
would
justify
some
difference
in
treatment--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--even
legislatively.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
the
quill
opinion
has
some
bearing
on
the
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
stare
decisis.
the
court
has
dealt
with
this
very
statute
in
california.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
days,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
california
tax
is
perfectly
valid
today
as
applied
to
barclays?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
september
9th?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
before
they
adopted
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
asking
you
what
your
position
is
as
of
september
9th
and
before
they
adopted
this
change.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
going
back
to
the
tax
year
in
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
our
analysis
should
just
turn
on
when
the
executive
branch
has
spoken,
and
with
what
clarity,
and
that's
what
turns
the
tide?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
your
theory,
i
guess,
or
maybe
it's
the
theory
adopted
by
the
court
below
that
you're
supporting,
if
congress
has
a
bill
before
it
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
state
taxation
and
for
whatever
reason
doesn't
pass
it,
then
that's
congressional
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
it.
there
we
are.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
tell
us
at
all
what
the
difference
in
money
would
be
if
california
were
collecting
based
on
the
arms-length
method
as
opposed
to
the
worldwide
combined--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--does
the
system
that
california
uses
impact
particularly
because
california
has
high
property
values
or
perhaps
high
wages
or
something,
and
these
are
part
of
the
formula--
