we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
92-1384,
barclays
bank,
plc
v.
franchise
tax
board
of
california,
number
92-1839,
colgate-palmolive

ms.
garvey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it
that
you
mean
by
a
jurisdiction
having
the
primary
right
to
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they're
not
binding
on...
the
united
states
has
not
subscribed
to
that
particular
treaty
that
would
prevent
california
from
taxing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
not--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--not
specifically
or
any
other
way,
has
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
garvey.
mr.
kleier,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kleier,
you
say
that
this
reaction
demonstrates
that
the
decision
in
container
was
wrong.
would
you
care
to
spell
that
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
mean
something
that
has
developed
since
container?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
president
reagan's
statement
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
the
solicitor
general's
statement
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
other
than
advising
us
of
the
position
the
federal
government
takes,
but
surely
that's
not
conclusive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
draw
from
these
various
pieces,
as
you
describe
them,
the
conclusion
that
container
was
wrong?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it's
at
the
very
heart
of
the
foreign
commerce
clause,
one
would
think
you
wouldn't
need
statements
by
president
reagan
or
a
brief
from
the
solicitor
general
to
confirm
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it's
acting...
so
far
as
congress
may
be
concerned,
at
least
in
the
case
of
a
domestic
corporation,
it
may
feel
there
is
no
need
for
any
action
because
the
container
corporation
says
there
is
no
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
mr.
kleier,
that
congress
has
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
getting
to
foreign
commerce
questions.
do
you
mean
anything
more
by
that
than
they
simply
don't
agree
when
they
do
get
to
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
could
say
that
about
any
branch
of
the
law,
where
something
came
up
in
congress
and
congress
proved
unable
to
enact
any
law
because
there
were
so
many
different
opinions
on
the
subject,
and
we
don't
generally
say
well,
that
means
congress
has
kind
of
defaulted
so
somebody
else
is
going
to
step
in.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
an
overriding
interest
compared
to
crime,
health
care
reform...
any
number
of
other
things
that
might
be
before
congress
where
there
might
not
be
any
agreement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kleier.
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sort
of
a
teague
rule
for
the
commerce
clause?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
laddish,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
relying
on
what's,
in
effect,
a
negative
implication
from
action
which
congress
took.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that's
the
same
thing
as
wardair.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
laddish.
ms.
garvey
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
treaty
ever
ratified,
ms.
garvey?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
