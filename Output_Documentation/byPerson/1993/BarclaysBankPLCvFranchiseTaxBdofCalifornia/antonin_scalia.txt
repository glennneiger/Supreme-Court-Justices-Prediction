i
thought
mr.
hamilton
was
arguing
that
in
support
of
giving
congress
the
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce,
i
take
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
negative
implication
is
there
from
the
action
that
congress...
what
action
did
congress
take
in
the
normal
sense
of
congressional
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
were
allied
provisions
that
did
contain
a
limitation,
and
it's
just
a
straightforward
application
of
an
old
maxim
of
interpretation,
inclusio
unius.
but,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
explicit
inclusion
of
one
thing
implies
the
exclusion
of
another.
what
is
included
here
that
implies
the
exclusion
of
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
just
mere
congressional
inaction
is
quite
different
from
a
situation
in
which
the
maxim
inclusio
unius
is
applicable.
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
the
history;
give
me
the
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
say,
mr.
laddish,
to
the
difficulty
of
congress'
enacting
legislation
in
this
area?
