but
a
preference
not
strong
enough
to
be
reflected
in
the
senate's
exercise
of
its
power,
because
it
didn't
have
enough
votes
for
the
supermajority
necessary.

commerce
is
in
fact
entrusted
to
congress,
foreign
commerce
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
in
the
aftermath
of
container,
would
you
agree
that
there
is
at
least
one
point
on
which
congress
does
have
a
particular
competence,
and
that
is
the
capacity
in
effect
to
change
a
tax
rule
without
raising
the
kinds
of
problems
of
retrospectivity
and
refund
that
would
be
the
case
if
we
saw
things
your
way?
congress
really
could
do
a
much
better
job
of,
as
it
were,
adjusting
the
balance,
than
we
could,
could
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it
gets
to
it,
it
can
do
a
better
job
of
it,
or
at
least
a
somewhat
less
fiscally
messy
job
of
it
than
we
can
do,
in
effect
by
turning
tail
so
soon
after
container.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
saying
that
if
congress
sees
it
your
way,
the
tax
is
going
to
be
changed
on
a
purely
prospective
basis.
if
we
were
to
look...
if
we
were
to
accept
your
argument,
there
would
be
a
serious
question
about
refund,
california
reliance,
and
so
on,
is
that
not
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
in
effect--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
you
in
effect
are
arguing
that
we
should
look
at
this
the
same
way
congress
would
look
at
it,
aren't
you?
because
i
think
you're
saying
that
because
the
retaliatory
effect
is
less
with
respect
to
an
event
subsequent
to
the
tax
years
in
question,
that
simply
should
color
our
judgment
with
respect
to
the
tax
years
in
question.
whatever
that
is,
i
don't
suppose
that's
a
statement
of
legal
principle,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
will
you
ever...
how
will
you
ever
be
defeated
on
a
one
voice
theory,
then,
when
congress
has
not
acted?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
if
it
hasn't
acted
you're
going
to
say
the
one
voice
is
that
each
state
can
do
what
it
will.
