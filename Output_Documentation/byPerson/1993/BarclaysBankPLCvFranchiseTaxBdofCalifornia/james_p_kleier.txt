mr.
james
p.
kleier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
is
the
culmination
of
11
years
of
national
and
international
reaction
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
container
case.
the
immediate
aftermath
of
that
decision,
including
reactions
from
the
federal
government
and
foreign
governments,
resulted
in
the
formation
of
the
president's
worldwide
unitary
taxation
working
group,
and
ultimately
president
reagan's
statement
directing
executive
departments
to
act
to
end
worldwide
combination.
the
case
which
provoked
this
federal
and
international
outcry
was
container,
a
case
which,
like
colgate,
involved
a
u.s.
based
group
engaged
in
foreign
commerce.
this
reaction,
as
chronicled
in
the
record
in
this
case,
demonstrates
that
the
result
in
container
was
wrong.
however,
it
is
not
necessary
for,
and
colgate
does
not
ask
this
court
to
overrule
container.
indeed,
colgate
asks
only
that
this
court
apply
the
doctrine
set
forth
in
container
to
the
record
in
this
case.
this
record
demonstrates
that
the
failure
of
container
was
a
lack
of
proof
of
a
consequence
to
worldwide--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
what
has
happened
since
container
is
not
only
evidence
of
a
federal
policy
opposed
to
the
application
of
worldwide
combination,
and
that
is
the
primary
evidence,
i
guess,
that
i
would
point
to.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
not
entirely.
actually,
the
majority
opinion
in
container,
the
majority
did
have
before
it
the
1982
submission
in
the
chicago
bridge
and
iron
case.
however--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--the
opinion...
that's
right.
the
opinion
found
there
was
no
evidence
that
in
1983,
at
the
time
of
the
container
decision,
that
that
brief
represented
the
continuing
position
of
the
federal
government,
yet
the
subsequent
developments,
including
president
reagan's
statement
and
up
to
and
including
the
solicitor
general's
statement
in
this
case--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--well,
to
be
more
direct,
i
guess,
the
submission
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--it
certainly
is
not
conclusive,
and
indeed,
that
was
set
forth
in
container.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
record
in
this
case
chronicles
a
series
of
pieces
of
evidence
of
what
the
policy
is
and
of
that
interference,
and
certainly
the
solicitor
general's
submission
in
this
case,
president
reagan's
statement,
those
are
all
pieces
of
evidence.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
that
the
result
in
container
was
wrong,
yes,
your...
yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
because
container
did
not
have
before
it
evidence
that
the
chicago
bridge
and
iron
case
represented
the
continuing
position
of
the
federal
government,
and
furthermore,
container
did
not
have
before
it
evidence
that
there
is
a
purpose
to
u.s.
foreign
policy
that
is...
that
worldwide
combination
interferes
with.
other
than
simply
the
danger
of
retaliation,
there
is
a
purpose,
a
key
element
of
u.s.
foreign
policy
other
than
keeping
foreign
nations
happy,
and
that
is
to
ensure
competitive
balance
for
u.s.
business
in
trade
with
foreign
countries.
this
objective,
and
that
it
is
an
objective
of
u.s.
foreign
policy,
is
set
forth
again,
evidenced
by
statements
in
the
record,
but
more
importantly,
that
objective
is
at
the
very
heart
of
the
purpose
of
the
foreign
commerce
clause.
to
paraphrase
alexander
hamilton
in
the
federalist
number
22,
no
nation
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
our
political
associations
would
be
unwise
enough
to
enter
into
stipulations
with
the
united
states
while
they
found
from
experience
that
they
might
enjoy
every
advantage
they
desired
in
our
markets
without
granting
us
any
return.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
certainly
that...
first
you
have
to
determine
that
the
interest
is
at
the
heart
of
the
commerce
clause,
then,
what
the
court
requires
further
is
some
indication
that
there
is
interference
by
california's
method
with
that
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
that
is
what
is
supplied
beginning
with
the
statement
in
the
chicago
bridge
and
iron
case.
as
a
result
of
the
principle
of
competitive
balance
for
u.s.
based
foreign
commerce,
which
has
existed
as
long
as
the
federal
government
has
existed,
worldwide
combined
reporting
should
not
be
applied
to
either
container
or
to
barclays.
in
addition
to
this
violation
of
a
clear
federal
directive,
the
container
court
expressly
acknowledged
the
lack
of
evidence
of
that
doctrine
in
the
container
opinion,
and
had
to
see...
basically
could
not
determine
whether
the
chicago
bridge
and
iron
submission
still
represented
its
position.
the
solicitor
general's
submission
here,
as
well
as
the
other
statements,
indicate
that
it
does.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
does
not
indicate
that
application
of
worldwide
combined
reporting
to
colgate
and
barclays
in
this
case
is
now
somehow
suddenly
consistent
with
federal
policy.
instead,
the
solicitor
suggests
that
a
result
adverse
to
colgate
and
barclays
is
appropriate--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--yes,
justice
stevens.
this
court
has
certainly
recognized
that
some
aspects
of
foreign
policy
are
not
properly,
or
very
well-conducted
at
the
pace
and
in
the
public
forum
that
congress
provides,
and
as
a
result
that
the
executive
must
have
some
authority
in
the
foreign
policy
arena,
and
that
is
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
the
commerce
clause
certainly
entrusts
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
to
congress.
nonetheless,
this
court
has
recognized
that
entrusting
that
power
to
congress
has
to
keep
the
states
out
of
certain
areas,
and
as
evidence
of
what
areas
the
state
should
be
kept
out
of,
this
court
has
historically
looked
to
indications
from
the
executive
branch
of
whether
a
particular
area
is
one
that
the
states
should
not
interfere
in,
even
in
the
absence
of
congressional
regulation.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
well,
certainly--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--well,
certainly
congress
could
act
to
change
the
policy,
but
there
are
certainly
areas,
very
sensitive
areas,
that
this
court
has
recognized
congress
isn't
very
good
at
getting
involved
in,
and
particularly
the
foreign
commerce
area
is
one
of
these.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
you
would
hope
that
that
might
provide
some
incentive
to
act.
nonetheless,
because
of
the
sensitive
nature
and
competing
interests
at
stake,
with
respect
to
foreign
commerce,
that
has
been
a
particular
area
that
has
demanded
special
scrutiny.
it
is
something
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
particularly
difficult
for
congress
to
act.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
it
certainly
in...
this
court
found
in
container
that
a
situation
involving
a
u.s.
parent
corporation
with
foreign
subsidiaries
is
foreign
commerce,
and
as
a
result,
it
does
involve
a
tax
on
foreign
commerce.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
well,
certainly
the
structure
that
california
uses
is
to
attribute
income
to
the
california...
i'm
sorry,
the
u.s.
parent,
in
colgate's
case.
being
a
u.s.
parent
with
foreign
subsidiaries
is
to
use
worldwide
income
to
measure
what
they
are
going
to
attribute
to
colgate
for
purposes
of
the
california
tax.
whether
it
really
is
income
earned
by
the
u.s.
parent
or
the
foreign
subsidiaries,
that
economic
determination
basically--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--certainly...
i
don't
know
about
theoretically,
but
in
terms
of
the
california
statute
it
is.
economically,
there
certainly
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
on
the
california
business.
that
is
certainly
the
way
that
california
attempts
to
justify
jurisdictionally
the
imposition
of
its
tax,
because
they
would
have
no
due
process
right
to
tax
the
income
if
they
acknowledge
that
it
was
income
of
the
foreign
subsidiaries.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
justice
souter,
the
problem,
i
guess,
is
congress
getting
to
that
point,
because
it
does
involve
questions
of
how
foreign
commerce
is
taxed,
and
that
being
an
area
where
congress
has
particular
difficulty
to
even
substantively
get
to
the
question
where
the
remedy
is.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
in
terms
of...
i'm
not
sure
if
i
fully
understand
the
question.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
well,
certainly
there
are
issues
with
respect
to
the
refund
in
this
case,
and
i
submit
that
those
same
issues
would
exist
in
the
event
that
congress
was
to
come
to
the
table.
the
problem
is
that
by
the
time
congress
acts
with
respect
to
this
question,
there
are
going
to
have
been
a
number
of
years
that
elapse
where
california
has
intruded
in
an
area
of
foreign
commerce,
basically
has
interfered
with
an
area
where
uniformity
is
essential,
and
contrary
to
a
federal
directive.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
by
the
time
that
exists...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
the
container
case
certainly
said
that
based
on
the
facts
before
it
at
the
time.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
certainly
not
at
all.
i
mean,
certainly
the
diversity
of
congress
adds
to
the
difficulty
in
terms
of
the
pace
and
the
sensitivity
with
which
congress
can
deal
with
those
questions,
and
that--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--well,
certainly
in
most
areas
there
is
no...
that's
right...
overriding
interest
that
simply
the
fact
of
disagreement
should
have
any
effect,
but
when
foreign
commerce
and
foreign
nations
are
involved,
and
the
equality
of
u.s.
business
doing
this
in
foreign
countries,
it
is
a
particularly
sensitive
area
where--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--because
of
what
was
recognized
in
the
constitution
as
the
need
for
particular
federal
attention
to
the
area
of
commerce,
and
going
beyond
that,
this
court
has
not
always
limited
that
to--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--certainly,
whatever
this
court
were
to
say,
congress
could
enact
a
statute
to
the
contrary,
and
that
would
control.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
it
certainly,
in
terms
of
the
method,
if
the
method
were
not
to
affect
foreign
commerce
and
foreign
relations,
then
indeed
it
could
be
handled
purely
internally.
in
this
area,
as
in
a
number
of
other
areas,
when
foreign
commerce
and
foreign
nations
become
involved,
this
court
has
generally
treated
that
as
an
area
that
warrants
more
sensitivity,
and
where
the
executive
sometimes
must
be
able
to
act
as
opposed
to
congress,
and
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
of
that
executive
action,
and
a
state
law
which
is
inconsistent
with
that
executive
action,
this
court
will
invalidate
the
state
law,
and
that
certainly
isn't
just
in
the
area
of
taxation,
although
most
of
those
cases
have
been
tax
cases.
certainly,
not
entirely.
for
example,
in
the
zschernig
v.
miller
case,
this
court
invalidated
oregon's
inheritance
scheme
to
the
extent
that
it
prohibited
east
german
nationals
from
inheriting--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--certainly
not
under...
under
both
equal
protection
and
the
commerce
clause,
and
indeed,
that
issue
has
been
raised
in
this
very
case.
there
are
two
elements--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--yes.
the
answer
is,
i
guess
we
would
be
back
by
saying
that--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
p.
kleier
i
think
that
there
would
be
an
issue
as
to
whether
congress
could
treat
the
two
differently.
the
way...
what
we
believe
controls
is
the
commerce
clause,
and
that
in
fact
even
under
the
commerce
clause
the
two
can't
be
treated
differently,
but
in
that
case
only
if
congress
doesn't
override
that
result,
that
is
correct,
so
we
certainly
have
not
raised
the
equal
protection
argument
the
same
way
as
the
commerce
clause
argument.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
certainly
not--
mr.
james
p.
kleier
--not
simply
because
it
is
a
u.s.
company
that
is
before
the
court.
to
the
extent
this
court
has
spoken
at
all
on
the
subject,
it
has
indicated
that
protected
forms
of
commerce,
there
should
be
no
discrimination
under
the
commerce
clause
between
different
protected
forms
of
commerce,
although
the
only
time
the
court
has
expressly
taken
up
the
issue,
it
involved
two
different
forms
of
interstate
commerce
in
the
boston
stock
exchange
case.
with
respect
to
this
case,
to
treat
a
u.s.
based
company
differently
simply
on
the
basis
that
it
is
a
u.s.
entity,
even
though
it
is
engaged
in
foreign
commerce
and
is
going
to
compete
with
foreign
businesses
in
the
exact
same
markets,
would
undercut
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
to
actually
see
that
u.s.
based
businesses
play
on
a
level
playing
field,
and
as
a
result,
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
would
warrant
no
discrimination.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
in
what
respect,
i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
p.
kleier
certainly,
in
terms
of...
that's
exactly
right,
and
in
the
quill
opinion,
however,
there
was
no
demonstration
of
a
sufficiently
different
and
changed
state
of
affairs.
here,
the
reaction
to
the
container
case,
all
the
way
up
through
the
solicitor
general's
submission
in
this
case,
demonstrate
that
indeed
what
was
missing,
the
evidence
that
was
missing
both
of
a
purpose
of
u.s.
foreign
policy
to
see
that
u.s.
businesses
are
treated
on
an
equal
playing
field,
and
then
additionally,
of
a
clear
federal
directive,
neither
of
those
existed
in
container,
and
in
fact,
with
respect
to
stare
decisis,
we
are
asking
that
the
doctrine
of
container
be
applied,
but
we
are
asking
that
it
be
applied
to
the
facts
that
are
before
the
court
here.
we
certainly
take
the
position
that
a
federal
policy
which
is
motivated
by
the
government's
desire
to
ensure
competitive
equality
between
u.s.
based
and
foreign-based
groups
is
at
the
very
heart
of
the
federal
interests
that
are
protected
by
the
commerce
clause.
a
federal
directive
which
furthers
competitive
balance
has
to
be
part
of
the
government's
one
voice
in
international
trade.
as
mr.
hamilton
implied
in
the
federalist
papers,
foreign
governments
simply
will
not
take
seriously
efforts
by
the
president
to
eliminate
unequal
treatment
of
u.s.
based
businesses
in
foreign
markets,
as,
for
example,
in
the
recent
trade
negotiations
with
japan,
if
those
foreign
governments
see
that
the
president
is
powerless
to
prevent
the
united
states'
own
states
from
putting
u.s.
based
businesses
at
a
disadvantage
in
foreign
commerce.
mr.
james
p.
kleier
well,
he
certainly
was
explaining
the
need
for
federal
regulation
of
commerce,
and
ultimately
that
power
was
given
to
congress,
but
what
he
was
explaining
was
the
need
to
keep
the
states
out,
and
it
is
that
need
to
keep
the
states
out
where
this
court
has
sometimes
looked
not
only
to
congressional
statutes,
but
to
sometimes
less
formal
directives
in
the
area
of
foreign
policy
and
foreign
commerce
which
are
not
evidenced
in
any
statute
or
in
any
treaty.
with
respect
to
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
that
it
is
not
present
policy
which
controls,
and
instead
it
is
only
some
historical
policy,
the
impact
of
a
tax
on
foreign
commerce
is
certainly
not
felt
at
the
time
a
tax
is
accrued.
it
is,
indeed,
when
a
tax
is
collected
and
levied
that
the
impact
in
international
trade
is
felt.
in
colgate's
case,
the
tax
is
not
collected
or
anywhere
close
to
collected
in
1970
to
1973,
the
year
that
the
tax
accrues.
california
must
first
determine
under
state
law
administratively
whether
it
wishes
to
apply
that
method
to
colgate,
and
indeed,
the
tax
is
ultimately
paid
in
1982,
and
the
final
administrative
action
that
california
takes
is
its
denial
of
colgate's
claim
for
refund
in
1984.
that
is
the
action
that
causes
the
interference
with
international
trade,
and
that
is
the
action
which
colgate
is
here
contesting
today.
as
a
result,
it
is
certainly
not
some
historical
inquiry
that
the
court
should
be
undertaking,
and
in
addition,
there
certainly
is
no
precedent
in
this
court's
decision
for
such
an
approach.
in
itel,
container,
and
japan
line,
in
none
of
those
is
there
some
historical
inquiry
limited
to
particular
years,
and
indeed,
for
the
president,
in
conducting
foreign
affairs,
to
say
i'm
sorry,
but
i
can't
do
anything
about
what
happened
last
year...
i
can't
do
anything
to
fix
it
today...
would
simply
gut
the
notion
of
executive...
any
executive
authority
in
the
area
of
foreign
policy
and
foreign
commerce,
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
ms.
garvey's
rebuttal.
