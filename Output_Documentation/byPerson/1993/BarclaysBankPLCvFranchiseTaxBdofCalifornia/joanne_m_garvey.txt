ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
barclays
case,
is
the
constitutionality
of
worldwide
combined
reporting
as
applied
to
a
foreign
multinational
enterprise.
the
united
states
and
the
nations
of
the
world
all
use
one
method
to
divide
international
income
for
tax
purposes...
the
arm's
length
separating
accounting
method.
that
all
nations
have
agreed
to
use
one,
and
only
one
method,
demonstrates
the
essential
need
for
uniformity
in
this
area.
for
over
20
years,
california
has
defied
this
international
standard
by
applying
a
different
and
inconsistent
method...
worldwide
combined
reporting.
whether
or
not
this
method
is
constitutional
as
applied
to
a
domestic
multinational
corporation,
it's
patently
unconstitutional
when
applied
to
a
foreign-owned
corporation.
first,
it
prevents
the
nation
from
speaking
with
one
voice
when
regulating
foreign
commerce,
second,
it
presents
a
substantial
risk
of
international
multiple
taxation,
and
third,
as
applied
by
california,
it
has
imposed
discriminatory
compliance
burdens.
now,
the
california
supreme
court
circumvented
these
issues
by
creating
a
new
test
for
avoiding
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis.
under
the
california
supreme
court's
test,
congressional
silence
replaces
the
traditional
requirement
of
affirmative
congressional
action.
california's
approach
has
no
basis
in
wardair
or
in
any
other
case
of
this
court.
wardair
looked
at
the
negative
implications
from
congressional
enactment,
not
negative
implications
for
no
enactment
at
all.
the
california
method
is
practically
unworkable
as
well.
it
is
difficult
enough
to
ascertain
a
congressional
meaning
from
an
act
of
legislation.
gleaning
congressional
meaning
from
congressional
inaction
is
impossible.
the
united
states-united
kingdom
treaty
is
a
good
illustration
of
the
difficulties.
the
treaty,
as
finally
ratified,
contained
no
mention
of
state
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting.
from
the
text,
it
is
not
possible
to
discern
any
senatorial
preference
or
dislike
for
the
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
the
courts
that
go
to
that,
because
for
some
reason
to
text
is
ambiguous,
indicates
a
senate
preference
for
barring
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting
rather
than
any
affirmative
congressional
policy
to
permit
the
states
to
use
that
method.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
that
is
correct,
and
as
a
result,
justice
rehnquist,
this
does
not
reflect
any
policy
sufficient
to
take
the
case
out
of
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis,
which
is
the
state's
argument,
and
moreover,
at
least
some
of
the
supporters
of
the
reservation
were
concerned
about
the
use
of
the
treaty
method
rather
than
with
any
restriction
on
worldwide
combined
reporting
to...
by
the
states
as
such,
and
in
fact,
both
of
the
contracting
parties,
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom,
have
made
it
clear
in
the
past
and
before
this
court
that
they
do
not
think
the
treaty
reserves
the
issue,
so--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--well--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--senatorial
awareness,
of
course...
because
i
don't
think
both
houses
of
congress
had
addressed
the
issue...
senatorial
awareness
is
not
a
substitution
for
this
court's
off-affirmed
principle
that
congress
must
act
affirmatively
to
remove
the
state
act
from
scrutiny
by
this
court
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
and
in
fact,
at
best,
the
treaty
situation
is
much
like
a
filibuster
in
which
the
majority
wasn't
sufficient
to
break
the
filibuster
over
a
particular
provision,
and
so
you
had
to
delete
that
provision
to
move
the
rest
of
the
legislation
forward.
that
deletion
would
not,
certainly,
indicate
congressional
policy
in
favor
of
the
opposite
of
the
deleted
provision.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
yes,
but
you
had
a
prohibition.
actually,
you
did
have
an
action
which
was
a
direct
prohibition
on
the
use
of
a
portion
of
state
taxes.
the
chicago
convention
contained
an
enactment
in
which
aviation
fuel
on...
state
tax
on
aviation
fuel
on
inbound
flights
was
specifically
prohibited.
there
was
no
mention
in
the
text
of
that
enactment,
signed
by
156
other
nations,
of
anything
to
do
with
state
tax
on
outgoing
flights.
from
that,
plus
the
fact
that
the
court
had
the
federal
aviation
act,
which
extensively
had
legislated
in
the
area
of
domestic
aviation
and
would
specifically
permit
this
tax,
this
court
could
start
with
a
text
from
which
to
discern
congressional
policy.
in
this
case,
we
still
have
no
text.
congress
has
not
acted
here,
and
this
case
should
be
analyzed
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
and
this
case
presents
a
textbook
example
of
a
state
tax
that's
violative
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
japan
line
and
container
provide
the
framework
here
for
analysis,
and
the
result
falls
on
the
japan
line
side
of
the
leger.
the
dispositive
factor
is
that
barclays
is
foreign.
there
are
direct
implications
on
united
states
foreign
policy
that
were
not
present
in
container,
where
a
domestic
enterprise
was
affected
by
a
domestic
tax.
barclays
should
prevail
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
for
at
least
four
reasons.
first,
the
clearest
evidence
of
implication
on
united
states
foreign
policy,
lacking
in
container,
is
present
here.
foreign
nations
are
offended
by
the
use
of
the
california
method.
their
offense
has
led
to
retaliatory
acts,
and
foreign
nations
have
a
long-recognized
and
proper
interest
in
the
well-being
of
their
nationals
and
protection
of
their
rights.
the
united
states
has
acknowledged
the
validity
of
foreign
reactions.
the
second
reason,
even
if
the
objective
evidence
of
foreign
policy
implications
were
not
present,
application
of
the
container
objective
factors
demonstrates
that
in
the
circumstances
present
here,
foreign
offense
is
inevitable.
first
of
all,
foreign
multinationals
are
exposed
to
a
greater
risk
of
double
tax
because,
typically,
more
of
their
operations
are
in
jurisdictions
which
have
the
primary
right
to
tax
that
income
that
california
includes
in
its
tax
base,
and
second,
a
foreign
government's
own
interests
are
affected.
under
the
international
practice,
the
home
nation
has
the
obligation
to
relieve
double
tax,
and
if
a
foreign
nation
has
to
relieve
excess
tax
from
the
california
system,
the
nation
then
has
the
hobson's
choice
of
relieving
the
tax
and
affecting
its
own
revenues,
or
making
its
businesses
less
competitive
by
not
relieving
the
tax.
there
is
no
framework--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--no,
that
argument
was
not
available,
your
honor...
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
sorry,
i
couldn't
tell
where
the
question
came
from.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
my
apologies.
no,
that
argument
was
not
available--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--that
is
correct.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
no,
because
the
obligation
to
relieve
the
tax
flows
back
to
the
home
country.
in
the
container
case,
that
would
have
been
the
united
states,
and
plus
there
was
no
obligation
on
a
foreign
affiliate,
for
example,
doing
business
in
italy.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
it's
a
hypothetical
obligation,
but
it
is
part
of
the
overall
international
practice
in
which--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--right.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
well,
if
i
might
try
to
see
if
i
can
answer
that
in
this
fashion,
justice
kennedy,
first
of
all,
in
container,
the
ultimate
parent
was
the
united
kingdom
company...
i'm
sorry,
a
united
states
company.
the
subsidiary
could
be
a
foreign
subsidiary
of
any
nation.
the
impact
of
the
tax
was
actually
in
the
united
states,
and
so
there
was
no
interest,
or
no
problem
necessarily
arising
directly
on
the
foreign
subsidiary
in
that
circumstance.
in
this
case,
the
foreign
parent
is
the...
a
united
kingdom
corporation,
and
in
fact
one
of
the
taxpayers
is
also
a
united
kingdom
corporation,
a
second
level
subsidiary,
and
so
when
the
tax
falls
on
the
taxpayer
here,
ultimately
the
burden
falls
back
into
the
united
kingdom
group
and
the
parent
company,
because
it
will
be
the
united
kingdom,
as
the
ultimate
sovereign
of
the
parent,
that
must
decide
whether
to
grant
a
credit
to
relieve
the
taxation
on
income
earned
abroad
by
either
the
domestic
subsidiary,
in
this
case
a
united
kingdom
corporation,
not
the
united
states,
so
the
argument
was
not
available
to--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--yes,
justice
stevens.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
justice
stevens,
i
would
have
to
respectfully
disagree.
the
california
method
puts
all
income
of
the
worldwide
group
wherever
earned,
into
a
single
pool,
and
then
divides
that
income
according
to
a
formula
ignoring
geographic
boundaries
profitability
and
other
nations
and
so
forth.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
because
of
the
unitary
business
principle
that
is
accepted
in
the
united
states
but
has
never
been...
we
are
here
to--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--right.
right.
we
are
not
conceding...
we
are
not
arguing
the
fact
that
we
are
or
are
not
unitary
in
this
case.
we
have
conceded
that.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
exactly.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
yes,
so
for
purposes
of
this...
however,
under
the
international
standard,
division
of
the
income
is
done
on
an
entirely
different
basis,
but
for
purposes
of
the
california
methodology,
it's
a
little
difficult
to
say
that
anyone
is
simply
measuring
by
a
worldwide
pool
of
income
which
requires
worldwide
information
gathering
even
to
begin
to
compute
the
tax
to
say
that
you're
only
taxing
california
income,
but
the
problem...
the
more--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--if
the
system
worked
as
it
were
designed
to
work,
and
you
were
only
taxing
that
fair
amount,
then
the
system...
yes,
you
would
only
be
taxing
california
income.
however--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--however,
there
is
a
danger
of
a
different
kind
of
double
taxation,
but...
and
you
also
must
consider
in
these
circumstances
the
implications
on
foreign
policy,
and
you
further
have--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--yes.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
right.
with
respect--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--all
right.
with
respect...
i'm
not
sure
i
do,
either,
justice
stevens.
it's
a
complex
area.
with
respect
to
the
double
taxation
point,
the
difficulty
you
have
is
this.
under
the
international
system,
nations
are
granted
the
primary
right
to
tax.
that
tax
is
based
on
geography,
because
the
purpose
of
the
system
is
essentially
to
resolve
competing
claims
among
nations
as
to
how
you
divide
the
tax
base,
because
in
a
unitary
business
or
in
a
worldwide
group,
you
eventually
end
up
with
a
base,
and
the
question
is
internationally
how
do
you
divide
it?
because
foreign
nations
are
more
likely
to
be
doing
business
in
jurisdictions
that
under
the
international
standard,
the
international
practice,
have
primary
right
to
tax,
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
a
portion
of
the
income
which
california
claims
is
going
to
be
included
in
the
tax
base
that
some
other
nation
has
the
right
also
to
tax,
and
in
this
case
there
was
actual
double
taxation,
but
the
problem
essentially
is,
you
have
two
competing
and
incompatible
systems,
and
as
a
result,
whether
you
have
double
tax
on
every...
on
a
day-to-day
basis,
you
have
the
risk,
because
the
two
systems
are
inapposite
and
cannot
be
reconciled.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
under
the
international
system,
the
international
practice
that
we've
referred
to
of
arm's
length,
separate
accounting,
there
are
some
basic
rules.
the
first
is
that
the
nation...
the
host
country
into
which
a
foreign
corporation
comes
in
to
do
business
has
the
right
to
tax
that
foreign
corporation--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--under
the
international
system
which
is
represented
in
internal
laws,
a
network
of
treaties,
model
treaties,
and
agreements
by
all
of
the
nations
that
enter
into
treaties
at
all
in
the
world,
this
is
the
one
way
they
all
agree
to
do
it,
so
if
a
nation
were
to
deviate
from
this
methodology,
they
would
essentially
have
to
consider
what
effect
it
had
on
their
other--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--right.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
well,
this--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--this
has
actually
attained
the
custom
of
nations,
but
there
is
no
international
jurisdiction
or
sovereign
that
could
say
to
california
or
the
united
states
you're
in
violation.
however,
there
are
treaty
obligations,
and
the
treaty
obligations
do
provide
a
framework,
and
in
fact--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--it
is
true
that
the
united
states
in
its
treaties
has
not
specifically
addressed--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--has
not...
has--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--that's
correct.
that
is
correct,
because
that
is
the
point.
they
have
not
addressed
the
point.
however,
you
have
an
international
practice
that
is
consistently
applied,
and
the
issue
here
under
the
commerce
clause
is
whether
the
uniformity
with
that
policy
is
essential.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
all
right.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
that
is
absolutely
correct--
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
--that
is...
if
the
worldwide
reporting
system
were
all
applied
in
the
same
fashion,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
if
all
nations
of
the
world
used
this,
the
answer
would
clearly
be
yes,
but
the
problem
is,
no
nation
of
the
world
uses
this,
and
so
as
a
result,
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
the
inquiry
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
uniformity
is
essential,
and
the
court
has
set
forth
tests
as
to
whether
that
is
essential.
one
test,
as
here,
where
a
state
tax
is
at
variance,
is
where
it
implicates
foreign
policy,
and
this
case
probably
presents
one
of
the
clearest
evidences
of
implication
of
foreign
policy.
we
have
offense,
we
have
the
problems
of
the
objective
factors,
we
have
the
compliance
burdens,
and
we
have
the
longstanding
difficulties
in
terms
of
trying
to
comply
both
with
respect
to
the
implications,
but
also
with
the
stand-alone
issues
of
burden,
which
is
a
discriminatory
effect,
and
the
double
taxes
we
have
just
discussed.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
joanne
m.
garvey
thank
you,
chief
justice.
united
states
has
sought,
from
the
very
beginning,
to
resolve
this
problem
of
states'
use
of
an
inconsistent
method
in
only
one
way;
have
the
states'
respect
the
international
practice
by
receding
to
a
tax
base
that
is
confined
to
the
united
states
tax
jurisdiction.
and
so
the
united
states
has
appeared
six
times
in
this
case,
four
times
in
support
of
barclays,
beginning
in
the
california
trial
court,
and
now
twice
on
the
other
side.
but
even
though
the
current
administration
now
supports
california,
its
position,
as
explicated
by
the
solicitor
general
and
in
its
briefs,
actually
continues
to
underscore
the
reasons
why
this
court
should
rule
in
barclays
favor.
first,
the
current
administration
did
not
support
california
until
california
changed
its
law
to
bring
it
into
ostensible
conformity
with
international
practice.
and,
in
fact,
as
the
california
legislative
committee
reports
acknowledge,
the
change
in
the
law
was
requested
by
the
administration
to
avoid
retaliation,
which
shows
the
clear
causal
connection
between
utilization
of
this
state
tax
to
divide
international
income
and
the
problems
and
the
implications
on
united
states
foreign
policy.
and
the
solicitor
general
also
mentioned,
but
the
brief
clearly
brings
out,
that
the
united
states
continues
to
supports
barclays
on
very
significant
points.
california's
wardair
analysis
is
inapplicable
in
the
eyes
of
the
united
states.
and,
second,
under
the
applicable
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis,
worldwide
combined
reporting
is
unconstitutional
when
it
is
incompatible
with
the
international
practice,
and
it
is
incompatible.
so
when
all
is
said
and
done,
the
current
administration's
difference
with
barclays
is
a
tiny
issue.
now,
they
say
there
were
not
sufficiently
clear
federal
executive
pronouncements
to
make
the
tax
unconstitutional
by
the
year

1978.
respectfully,
that
is
legally
and
factually
incorrect.
the
federal
executive
does
not
have
to
issue
a
clear
federal
directive
for
the
tax
to
be
unconstitutional.
this
position
ignores
the
very
presumptive
need
for
uniformity
that
underlines...
that
underlies
the
dormant
foreign
commerce
clause
issue,
because
it
is
uniformity
that
is
issue
and
it
is
the
need
to
comply
to
prevent
exactly
what
has
happened
here.
with
respect
to
the
1994
legislation,
that
is
not
before
this
court.
prospective

does
not
solve

constitutional
violation.
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
be
put
in
the
position
it
would
have
been
had
the
tax
been
collected
constitutionally.
and
finally,
the
united

is
factually
incorrect
because
there
were
clear
federal
executive
pronouncements...
if
that
is
the
test,
and
we
do
not
contend
that
it
is;
we
believe
it
is
the
implication
on
foreign
policy
that
is
the
test,
and
the
inherent
problems
caused
by
the
variation.
but
in
any
event,
in
the
year
1975
the
united
states
executive
signed
a
treaty
with
the
united
kingdom
that
would
have
banned
this,
and
what
could
be
a
clearer
indication
of
federal
executive
policy,
a
policy
that
was
consistently
followed
and
has
not
been
deviated
even
by
the
