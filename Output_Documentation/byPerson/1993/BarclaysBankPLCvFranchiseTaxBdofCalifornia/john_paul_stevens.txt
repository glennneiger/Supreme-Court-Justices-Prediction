justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
the
assumption,
if
you
think
this
very
complex
system
really
works,
that
all
that's
being
taxed
is
income
earned
in
california,
and
that
one
looks
at
the
other
income
only
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
share
of
the
total
is
attributable
to
california?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
acknowledge
you
have
a
unitary
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
challenged
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
to
assume
you
are
for
purposes
of
our
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
explain
that
to
me.
now,
i
ask,
putting
aside
for
one
moment
the
extreme
burden
of
complying,
assembling
information,
if
one
assumes
that
the
system
works
as
it
is
designed
to
work,
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
does
or
not,
then
is
it
not
true
that
you're
only
taxing
that
proportion
of
the
total
which
the
business
in
california
represents
to
the
total?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that's
true,
then
there's
no
danger
of
double
taxation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
addressing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
one
argument
of
multiple
taxation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
must
say
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing?
when
you
refer
to
federal
policy...
earlier
you
talked
about
the
position
of
the
federal
government.
are
you
actually
saying
the
position
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
this
case
involve
the
tax
on
foreign
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
tax
was
on
california
operations
of
subsidiaries
of
foreign
entities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
foreign
commerce
is
a
base
from
which
the
tax
is
calculated,
but
theoretically
at
least...
and
one
always
has
to
be
skeptical...
theoretically
the
tax
is
on
domestic
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
vermont's
tax
that
we
reviewed
in
the
mobil
case?
what
about
all
the
other
states?
does
the
fact
that
california
changes
its
policy
govern
the
entire
nation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
sort
of
basic
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
laddish.
supposing
we
didn't
have
all
this
history.
none
of
this
had
happened,
congress
had
never
considered,
nobody
had
talked
about
it,
a
purely
dormant
commerce
clause
issue...
you
argue
it's
a
nondormant.
if
it
were
a
dormant
commerce
clause
issue
100
percent
pure
and
simple,
would
the
tax
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
think
that
that's
part
of
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
argue
that
very
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
say
that
congress
has
not
spoken.
if
you
assume
there
can
only
be
one
voice
and
only
one
policy
with
this
kind
of
tax,
federal
policy
is
quite
different
from
california's
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that,
by
hypothesis,
a
demonstration
that
there
are
two
voices
out
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
says
to
use
one
kind
of
accounting,
the
other
says
use
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
that
any
state
tax
on
foreign
commerce
or
had
a
severe
impact
on
foreign
commerce
would
be
valid
as
long
as
congress
has
not
spoken?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
there
a
violation
of
the
one
voice
policy
if
congress
has
spoken
in
a
limited
area
and
says
when
we're
talking
about
federal
taxes,
this
is
our
voice,
none
of
this
kind
of
stuff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
state
has
a
different
policy,
why
isn't
that
two
voices?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
they
have.
they've
said
we...
the
federal
government
will
not
impose
this
kind
of
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
did
more
than
that;
they
disabled
themselves
from
using
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
enable
them.
they
just
left
those
alone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing...
i'm
puzzled.
it
seems
to
me
you
keep
vacillating
between
dormant
and
nondormant
and
i've
been
trying
to
get
the
picture
in
my
mind
of
a
100
percent
pure
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis,
where--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
it
seems
to
me
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
particular
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
have
spoken
to
the
international
world
generally
that
one
aspect
of
american
policy
is
the
federal
government
will
not
impose
this
kind
of
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
that
doesn't
count
as
a
voice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
try
the
one
voice
concern
again.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
it's
not
only
one
voice
with
california
and
the
united
states
government.
there
are
50
states
out
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
not
contend,
would
you,
that
all
50
states
must
apply
this
unitary
business
approach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
half
the
states
can
use
the
other
kind
of
accounting
and
california...
how
can
that
be
one
voice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
back...
you're
back
to
nondormant.
it
seems
to
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i'm
trying
to
hypothesize
a
case
and
i
can't
seem
to
get
you
to
address
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
congress
had
been
totally
silent.
nobody
had
ever
spoken
to
congress
and
the
executive
never
said
anything
about
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
english
company
comes
in
and
says
we're
entitled
to
have
a
rule
of
law
that
is
the
same,
under
the
one
voice
principle,
throughout
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
your
argument
that
the
one
voice
principle
does
not
apply
at
all,
or
when
50
states
use
50
different
programs
that's
still
one
voice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
lose
that
or
would
you
win?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
win
because
the
one
voice
rule
doesn't
apply
or
because
there's
only--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--one
voice
even
though
50
states
all
act
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you're
saying
they
don't
need
one
voice.
