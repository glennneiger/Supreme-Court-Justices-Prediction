justice

bader

nonetheless,
it
is
clear
from
the
history
that
you
recited
that
congress
was
certainly
well
aware
of
this
problem
and
this
debate,
and
did
nothing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
it
surely
could
have.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
in
the
wardair
case,
as
you
mentioned,
the
use
of
the
words,
affirmatively
acted,
but
the
affirmative
action
was
by
nonaction,
right,
by
failure
to
forbid
the
state
taxes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
clarify
what
you...
when
you're
talking
about
right,
you
say
that
nations
in
an
international
community
agree
that
this
is
a
fair
way
of
doing
things,
but
there
is
no
right.
there
is
no
obligation
to
do
it
that
way.
you
say
under
the
international
system--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
retaliation
might--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there
is
no
treaty,
there
is
no
higher
law
that
is
being
violated.
you're
bringing
this
case
under
the
u.s.
constitution
saying
the
foreign
commerce
clause
is
a
stopper,
but
there's
no
international
law
that
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--stop
california
from
doing
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
constitution
gave
congress
the
power
to
regulate,
and
whatever
we
say,
am
i
right,
that
we
are
not...
we
would
not
be
the
final
arbiter.
the
last
word
is
for
congress
in
this
area.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
major
themes
running
through
the
briefs
on
your
side
is
the
international
community
and
the
international
custom,
and
yet
i
don't
know
of
any
other
country
in
the
world
where
a
question
like
this
would
be
referred
to
a
court
as
the
decision-maker.
it
would
be
a
legislative
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kleier,
if
congress
were
to
disapprove
in
the
future
state
taxation
of
foreign
international
corporations
such
as
the
petitioner
in
the
prior
case,
but
not
for
domestic
multinationals
such
as
your
client,
would
you
be
back
here
arguing
a
constitutional
violation
under
equal
protection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
laddish,
may
i
take
it,
then,
that
you're
answering
the
question
that
general
days
did
not
answer.
that
is,
that
you'd
say
you
can
go
back
tomorrow
and
do
what
you
have
been
doing
for
years,
and
it
would
not
be
offensive
to
the
federal
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
case
i
have
to
announce
is
barclays
bank
against
franchise
tax
board
consolidated
with
colgate-palmolive
against
franchise
tax
board.
these
consolidated
state
tax
refund
cases
concern
the
constitutionality
of
the
worldwide
combined
reporting
method,
a
method
california
used
in
the
years
at
issue
to
determine
the
corporate
franchise
tax
owed
to
the
state
by
unitary
multinational
corporate
group
members
doing
business
in
california.
california's
calculation
started
with
the
worldwide
income
of
the
group.
the
state
imposed
its
tax
on
a
portion
of
that
income,
a
portion
equal
to
the
arithmetic
average
of
the
proportions
of
worldwide
payroll,
property,
and
sales
located
within
california.
eleven
years
ago,
in
container
corporation
of
america
against
franchise
tax
board,
this
court
held
that
the
california's
scheme,
as
applied
to
a
domestic-based
multinational,
did
not
violate
the
constitutiom's
commerce
clause.
we
adhere
to
that
decision
today
and
further
hold
that
the
constitutional
assessment
is
not
dispositively
different
as
applied
to
foreign-based
multinationals.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgments
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
which
denied
the
tax
refund
claims
of
petitioner,
barclays,
a
foreign-based
multinational
and
of
petitioner
colgate,
a
domestic
multinational.
among
rulings
made
and
explained
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
court
rejects
barclays'
charges
that
california
imposed
inordinate
compliance
burdens
on
foreign-based
enterprises
and
exposed
such
enterprises
to
constitutionally
intolerable
prospects
of
double
taxation.
on
the
issue
most
energetically
pressed
by
the
parties,
we
hold
that
california's
scheme
did
not
prevent
the
federal
government
from
speaking
with
one
voice
in
international
trade.
congress
holds
the
control
reign.
it
has
the
deciding
voice
in
this
area.
congress
has
been
informed
for
many
years,
both
before
and
after
this
court's
decision,
in
container
corporation
of
the
displeasure
of
foreign
governments
with
these
five
california
or
any
other
taxing
jurisdiction
of
the
worldwide
combined
reporting
method.
aware
that
worldwide
combined
reporting
is
out
of
accord
with
the
transactional
method
used
in
our
own
federal
income
tax
system
and
in
the
system
of
other
developed
countries,
congress
has
nevertheless
failed
to
enact
any
of
the
newest
measures
purposed
to
bar
use
of
the
method
challenged
by
barclays
and
colgate.
executive
branch
actions,
statements,
and
print
of
the
court
filings
do
not
supply
the
requisite
federal
directive
proscribing
states
used
of
worldwide
combined
reporting
for
the
regulatory
authority
