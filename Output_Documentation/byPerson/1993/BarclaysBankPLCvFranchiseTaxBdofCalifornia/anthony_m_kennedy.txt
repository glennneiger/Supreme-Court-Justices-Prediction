justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
that
argument
available
to
the
taxpayer
in
container
corporation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
from
over
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
were
there
not
foreign
affiliates
in
container
corp.?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
not
a
foreign
nation
under
your
hypothesis
have
felt
some
duty
to
lesson
the
impact
of
the
california
tax
on
those
foreign
affiliates
that
were
within
its
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
to
me
when
we
say,
obligation,
that's
simply
hypothetical
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
don't
quite
understand.
if
an
english...
the
english
government
is
concerned
that
one
of
its
subsidiaries...
one
of
its
corporations,
which
is
a
subsidiary
of
an
american
company,
is
paying
too
much
tax
in
california,
then
wouldn't
it
have
the
same
motive
to
give
it
some
amelioratory
treatment
as
it
would
in
the
case
that
you
have
posed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
why
it
makes
a
difference
that
there
is
a
parent
in
one
case
and
a
subsidiary
in
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
before
we
get
to
uniformity,
and
before
we
leave
the
double
taxation
point--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
justice
stevens
raised,
i
take
it
that
the
double
taxation
is
caused
by
the
juxtaposition
of
the
two
systems.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
everybody
had
the
worldwide
reporting
system,
there
would
be
no
double
taxation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
whatever
the
rule
should
be
for
determining
the
foreign
policy
position
of
the
united
states...
and
this
case
itself
shows
that
that's
a
very
difficult
determination
to
make...
once
this
court
has
spoken,
as
we
did
in
container,
it
seems
to
me
then
that
there
is
a
special
obligation
on
the
congress
to
act
affirmatively
if
it
wishes
to
change
our
assessment
of
that
policy--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
we
said
as
much
in
a
domestic
context
in
the
quill
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
don't
you
think
they
might
be
a
little
bit
better
after
we've
decided
the
issue?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
1970
california
tax
were
still
in
operation,
the
tax
that
barclays
objects
to,
if
it
were
still
in
operation,
what
then
would
be
your
position
as
to
its
validity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
it
be
constitutional,
consistent
with
our
foreign
policy
interests,
for
california
today
to
reinstate
the
worldwide
reporting
statute
that
it
seeks
to
apply
to
barclays?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
you
cannot
say
with
assurance
that
under
my
hypothetical
case
the
statute
would
be
consistent
with
our
foreign
policy
interests.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but,
i
had
thought...
you
indicate
that
they
have
these
figures,
every
company
has
them.
wasn't
there
a
finding
that
it
would
cost
something
in
the
range
of
$5
million--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
establish
this
system,
and
then
substantial
sums
in
order
to
maintain
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
it's
not
burdensome
because
there's
this
approximation
option?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
the
approximation
option
were
not
available,
this
would
be
a
substantial
burden
on
the
taxpayer
from
the
standpoint
of
accounting
costs,
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
doesn't
quite
square
with
your
argument
that
everybody
has
these
figures
and
it's
easy
to
give
the
figures.
