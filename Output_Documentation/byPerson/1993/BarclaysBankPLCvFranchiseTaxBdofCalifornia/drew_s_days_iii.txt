mr.

s.
days,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
view
of
the
united
states,
petitioners
have
not
sustained
their
burden
of
showing
that
the
taxes
at
issue
in
this
case
were
unconstitutional,
whether
their
claims
are
viewed
from
the
perspective
of
california
law
as
it
exists
today,
or
from
the
perspective
of
a
legal
situation
that
existed
during
the
tax
years
at
issue.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
we
do.
our
position
is
that
insofar
as
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
the
ability
of
the
federal
government
to
achieve
uniformity
in
foreign
affairs
or
speak
with
one
voice,
that
what
california
has
done
as
of
september
10,
1993,
to
change
its
law
and
provide
corporations
like
barclays
with
an
option,
an
election
to
adopt
water's
edge--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--september
9th?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
before
they
adopted
it,
we
have
not
taken
a
position
in
this
case
as
to
whether
it
would
satisfy
the
standards
that
we've
set
out.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
would
say--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
same
analysis
that
we've
utilized
with
respect
to
the
tax
years
at
issue
in
our
brief
is
the
one
that
should
be
applied
here.
what
we
have
on
september
9th,
1993,
is
a
situation
where
california
has
changed
its
law
in
1986
to
provide
a
water's
edge
election,
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
violation
between
1986
and
september
9th,
1993,
would
depend
upon
whether
during
that
period
the
united
states
felt
that
it
could
not
speak
with
one
voice,
or
that
there
was
a
need
for
federal
uniformity.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
our
position
would
be
that
during
the
period
from
1980
through
1986,
there
were
expressions
of
concern
by
the
federal
government...
that
is,
by
the
executive
branch...
with
respect
to
the
california
taxing
scheme.
thereafter,
there
was
a
change
in
the
policy
and
what
we
saw
as
our
history
indicates
in
our
brief,
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
executive
branch
to
seek
legislation,
and
then
a
pulling
back
in
response
to
california's
change
in
its
law.
we
have
not
gone
through
a
thorough
analysis
of
that
period,
because
as
we've
suggested
to
the
court,
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
american
foreign
policy
during
the
tax
year
in
question
was
in
fact
such
that
california's
practice
was
unconstitutional
under
the
foreign
commerce
clause.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
what
would
be
necessary
is
an
evaluation
of
the
principles
that
have
been
set
out
by
this
court
in
japan
line
and
container
corporation.
i
think
we
have
to
start
from
the
proposition
that
california
has
been
using
a
method
that
this
court
upheld
in
container
corporation.
it's
not
a
situation
where
california
is
trying
to
tax
income
that
is
not
justifiably
taxed
by
the
state
of
california.
in
fact,
this
court
has
said
that
california's
method
is
really
a
benchmark
insofar
as
taxing
schemes,
apportionment
schemes
are
concerned.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct.
we
are
very
clear,
looking
at
the
record
as
to
the
tax
year
in
question,
and
think
that
during
that
period
what
the
record
reflects
is
a
preference
on
the
part
of
the
united
states,
on
the
part
of
the
executive
branch,
but
not
a
policy.
to
the
extent
that
there's
reliance
on
the
u.s.--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--not
at
all,
justice
o'connor.
the
suggestion
that
briefs
filed
by
the
executive
branch,
or,
indeed,
executive
branch
pronouncements,
determine
the
constitutional
issue
before
the
court,
is
not
an
argument
that
we're
making.
what
we
see
the
situation
presented
as
being
is
a
case
where
we
know
that
the
federal
government
has
foreign
affairs
concerns,
we
have
a
state
taxing
in
a
way
that
this
court
has
said
is
constitutional,
and
so
the
question
is,
what
does
the
court
look
to
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
statement
by
congress
through
statute,
or
by
way
of
a
treaty?
we
think
that
under
those
circumstances
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
look
at
what
the
executive
branch
has
done,
what
was
executive
branch
policy
during
that
period.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
not
quite,
your
honor.
it's
really
a
question
of
taking
that
as
evidence,
and
to
the
extent
that
there's
been
citation
to
briefs
filed
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
expressing
the
views
of
the
united
states,
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
it's
important
for
the
court
to
look
at
not
the
briefs
as
an
indication
of
american
foreign
policy
or
executive
branch
policy,
but
to
look
at
them
only
to
the
extent
that
they
reflect
foreign
policy
determinations
that
have
been
made
elsewhere,
and
in
this
case
we
are
suggesting
that
whatever
briefs
may
have
been
filed
subsequently,
they
did
not
focus
on
the
tax
years
at
issue.
if
one
focuses
on
those
tax
years,
as
i've
indicated,
we
see
a
preference
but
not
a
policy,
a
willingness
on
the
part
of
the
executive
branch
to
allow
states,
except
in
the
context
of
the
u.k.
u.s.
tax
convention
originally,
to
tax
foreign
nationals
using
the
worldwide
combined
reporting
method,
and
therefore
we
think
that
that
is
the
correct
representation.
but
to
return
to
my
other
point...
it's
a
point
raised,
i
think,
by
justice
souter's
question...
what
does
the
court
do
under
these
circumstances?
it
seems
to
us,
however
the
court
resolves
this
issue,
and
with
regard
to
whatever
years,
that
this
is
really
a
third
party
claim
on
the
part
of
barclays.
what
we
ultimately
are
boiling
this
case
down
to
is
whether
what
california
was
doing
prevented
the
federal
government
from
speaking
with
one
voice
or
achieving
uniformity.
we
think
that
with
the
change
made
by
california
in
september
of
last
year,
whatever
retaliatory
concerns
that
might
have
been
raised
for
the
entire
federal
government,
certainly
for
the
executive
branch,
have
been
removed,
and
therefore
this
is
not
a
situation
where
we
have
a
discriminatory
tax.
justice
stevens,
you're
exactly
correct
on
the
whole
question
of
what's
being
taxed.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
is
something
that
the
court
has
to
take
into
consideration
in
determining
objective
considerations,
whether
what
california
or
vermont
is
doing
violates
the
foreign
commerce
clause,
but
failing
a
clear
answer
with
respect
to
those
objective
inquiries,
it
is
our
position
that
one
place
to
look
is
to
the
executive
branch,
and
what
we
are
saying
not
as
a
matter
of
history,
but
speaking
about
the
contemporaneous
relationship
of
the
united
states
government
with
our
trading
partners
that
what
california
has
done
has
removed
whatever
tension
might
have
been
presented
at
an
earlier
point
by
what
california
was
doing.
this
is
also
not
a
situation
where
there
is
anything
to
be
served
by
paying
california's
taxes
back
to
barclays
in
the
form
of
a
refund.
backward-looking
relief
is
infeasible
under
these
circumstances.
to
the
extent
that
what
california
has
done
to
impair
the
federal
government's
relations
in
the
foreign
affairs
area,
that
has
already
been
accomplished.
requiring
california
to
refund
money
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--it
seems
to
us
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
certainly,
this
court
has
never
explicitly
held...
may
i
complete
the
answer
+/?
explicitly
held
this,
but
we
think
that
looking
at
this
court's
decisions
with
respect
to
refunds
of
taxes,
this
court
has
held
that
refunds
were
required
when
it
was
a
matter
of
discrimination,
where
the
tax
went
beyond
merely
what
was
legitimate
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction,
or
where
the
parties
taxed
were
immune
from
taxation.
we
think
that
this
particular
situation
is
unique,
and
therefore
are
suggesting
that
the
court
adopt
a
unique
remedy.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
thank
you
very
much.
