mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
extremely
helpful
for
the
solicitor
general
to
point
out
a
fatal
flaw
in
the
taxpayers'
approach,
but
i'm
afraid
we
must
point
out
that
both
the
taxpayers
and
the
executive
branch
have
lost
sight
of
two
of
the
bright
stars
of
commerce
clause
navigation.
first,
that
the
constitution
gives
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
to
congress,
not
to
executive
branch
letters
or
policy
statements
or
anything
of
the
like.
and
second,
that
there
must
be
a
clear
line
of
demarcation
maintained
between
a
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis
and
a
nondormant
commerce
clause
analysis,
and
confusion
results
from
the
taxpayers'
brief
in
this
area.
well,
what
is
dormant?
well,
just
a
grizzly
bear
is
dormant
when
it's
hibernating,
congress
is
dormant
as
to
a
commerce
clause
issue
when
it
is
not
making
decisions
on
that
issue
informing
united
states
law.
what
is
not
dormant?
well,
if
the
bear's
out
of
the
den,
down
at
the
stream
choosing
which
fish
to
swat
up
on
the
shore
and
which
fish
to
let
go
by,
that
bear
is
not
dormant
as
to
any
of
those
fish.
similarly,
if
congress,
informing
the
commerce
law
of
the
united
states,
is
choosing
which
tax
practice
to
prohibit
and
which
tax
practice
to
let
go
by,
then
congress
is
not
dormant
as
to
any
of
those
tax
issues
that
are
under
congressional
scrutiny.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
no--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--no,
justice
o'connor,
we
would
not
take
that
position.
that
is
not
the
position
this
court
has
ever
taken
and
we
would
not
take
that
position.
what
we
do...
what
we
do
rely
upon
is
this
court's
wardair
decision.
and
i
should
label
this.
we're
talking
nondormant
commerce
clause
here,
where
the
one
voice
has
spoken.
the
wardair
court
in
the
wardair
decision
makes
it
clear
that
permission,
congressional
permission,
the
one
voice
can
speak
in
terms
of
congressional
acquiescence
that
is
implied
in
congressional
actions.
if,
indeed,
such
implied
permission
exists,
then
the
one
voice
has
spoken
through
the
congressional
actions
and
no
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis
is
required
or
necessary.
that
is
the
holding
in
the
wardair
case
and
that
clearly
falls
on
the
nondormant
side.
now,
here
it's
claimed
that
the
california
supreme
court
held
something
different.
well,
actually,
if
you
look
at
page
a-27
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
where
the
california
supreme
court
holds
that
the
federal
government
has
affirmatively
acted
rather
than
remain
silent
and
has
acquiesced
in
the
taxes
in
this
case,
that's--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--certainly.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
the
tax
would
be
constitutional.
and
would
you
like
me
to
go
into
that
aspect
at
this
point?
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
certainly.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
well,
i
plan
to,
your
honor.
if
i
might,
i
could
get...
i'll
be
getting
back
there.
with
the
wardair
decision...
which,
by
the
way,
explicitly
did
not
rely
upon
the
federal
aviation
act.
there's
a
statement
in
the
court's
decision
saying
it's
not
doing
that...
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty
in
this
case
provides
a
perfect
opportunity
for
this
court
to
apply
the
wardair
analysis.
in
fact,
it's
a
better
opportunity
than
wardair
itself,
because
in
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty
the
court
need
not
assume
that
the
state
tax
issue
was
before
congress
when
congress
made
the
action.
in
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty,
the
treaty
came
to
the
senate
with
a
direct
ban
on
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting
contained
in
the
treaty.
as
long
as
that
ban
remained
in
the
treaty,
the
treaty
could
not
obtain
the
constitutionally
required
two-thirds
vote
for
senate
approval.
with
that
ban
on
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting
in
the
treaty,
the
treaty
died,
and
it
could
only
be
resurrected
when
congress,
the
senate
did
something,
as
one
justice
pointed
out.
they
did
something
by
putting
in
a
reservation
to
that
treaty
which
removed
the
ban
as
to
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting,
kept
it
as
to
the
national
government.
the
treaty
then
went
back
for
renegotiation
with
the
united
kingdom,
and
with
some
concessions
that
the
united
states
had
to
give
in
order
to
get
u.k.
approval,
the
treaty
then
came
back
to
the
senate,
was
approved,
and
was
ratified
with
no
ban
as
to
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting,
but
a
ban
as
to
the
federal
government.
it's
admitted
that
there
could
be
no
clearer
situation
for
the
wardair
analysis,
to
find
an
unmistakable
implication
in
the
law
that
the
states
had
been
permitted
to
use
worldwide
combined
reporting.
in
terms
of
the
grizzly
bear,
the
congress
had
chosen
to
swat
the
national
fish
and
let
the
state
fish
go
by,
and
after
considerable
scrutiny.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes,
in
those
terms,
mr.
chief
justice;
that's
what
they
used.
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--in
the
same
sense
that
in
wardair
they
found
an
implication...
i
should
say
you
found
an
implication...
in
that
the
national
government
of
a
federal
system
was
the
sole
member
of
that
system
that
was...
that
had
a
limitation
put
upon
it.
and
from
that,
the
court
in
wardair
drew
an
implication
that
the
states
within
that
federal
system
would
not
have
the
same
implication,
and--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--well--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--well,
i
mean,
it's
the
same
principle
as
in
wardair,
but
also
it's
the
culmination
of
decades
of
congressional
acquiescence
in
the
other
treaties.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
we
also
have--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--i
don't...
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
any
distinction
between
what
the
court
did
in
wardair
and
what
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty
was.
they
have
the
same
sort
of
application
of
the
limitation...
i'm
just
talking
right
now
from
the
terms
of
the
treaty,
without
looking
at
all
the
history.
it's
clear
from
the
history,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
that
going
into
the
treaty
and
through
all
the
negotiations
and
finally
in
the
final
renegotiations
and
the
signing
of
the
treaty--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--oh,
the
text.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes.
the
text
is...
as
it
came
out
and
was
approved
by
the
senate,
the
text
was
"this
limitation
applies
to
the
national
government.
"
and
there's
no
mention
of
the
states
in
that
particular
text.
the
states
are
mentioned
in
the
treaty,
that
states
are
subjected
to
other
limitations.
just
as
in
wardair,
in
separate
treaties
or
separate
agreements,
the
states
were
subjected
to
certain
limitations
and
not
others.
here
we
have
one
document
with
a
synergistic
combination
of
both
of
the
types
of
implications
from
wardair.
adding
to
that,
you
have
the
implication
of
through
the
history
of
these
bilateral
treaties
where
the
international
model
treaty
of
the
oecd
would
restrict
the
states,
as
well
as
the
national
government,
to
the
arms-length
approach,
thus
barring
them
from
using
the
unitary
business
approach,
particularly
as
to
branches
of
the
corporations.
in
all
the
treaties,
in
dozens
and
dozens...
in
every
united
states
bilateral
income
tax
treaty
through
the
years,
the
federal
government
has
been
subjected
to
an
arms-length
limitation
and
the
states
have
not
been
subjected
to
that
limitation.
certainly,
the
issue
was
on
the
table
as
to
these
treaties
because
there
are
these
model
foreign
treaties
that
would
have
subjected
the
states.
and,
in
fact,
in
a
considerable
number
of
these
treaties
which
are
set
forth
on
page
17
of
the
alaska
brief
in
support
of
our
position,
there
are
a
significant
number
of
these
treaties
where
the
political
subdivision
of
the
other
states
of
the
other
nation
were
subjected
to
this
arms-length
restriction,
and
still
the
states
of
the
united
states
were
not.
so
i
submit
that
the
indications,
certainly
in
the
wardair
treaty
with
the
history,
but
forget
the
history,
look
to
the
language
of
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty
and
to
the
other
dozens
and
dozens
of
united
states
treaties.
the
common
feature
in
all
of
those...
and
if
this
is
the
international
standard,
i'm
perfectly
happy
to
live
with
it...
is
that
the
national
governments
are
restricted
to
the
use
of
the
arms-length
approach.
the
state
governments
are
not,
and
thus
can
use
the
unitary
business
approach
with
its
formulary
apportionment
of
income,
one
form
of
which
is
worldwide
combined
reporting.
so
under
wardair,
and
under
the
itel
containers
case
from
1993,
if
the
standard
is
put
in
itel,
the
most
rational
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
body
of
law,
from
the
treaties
themselves,
federal
law,
is
that
the
states
are
impliedly
permitted
to
use
worldwide
combined
reporting.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
what
the
record
shows
is
that...
as
to
the
differences
in
the
amounts
between
the
returns
that
were
filed
and
the
assessments
as
to
tax
amounts,
for
barclays
bank
international
it
was
$1,678;
for
barclays
bank
of
california,
for
example,
it
was
$152,470.
that
was
approximately
12
percent
and
28
percent,
respectively,
difference
between
the
systems.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--well,
i
should
point
out...
there's
an
assumption...
and
i
was
going
to
wait
until
i
got
to
my
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis,
but
i
think
there's
an
assumption
we
have
to
dispel
here
that
somehow
we
collect
excess
taxes
and
we
cost
the
taxpayers
the
inordinate
amount
of
money
to
comply
with
our
wild
scheme
of
taxation.
first,
i'd
point
out
that
this
court,
in
container,
which
is
consistent
with
this
court's
doctrine
through
70
years
of
court
procedure,
has
held
that
this
is
a
proper
and
fair
method
of
taxation,
that
it
is
a
method
of
taxation
that
fairly
apportions
income
to
the
taxing
jurisdiction
with
a
reasonable
sense
of
how
income
is
generated,
and
that...
and
this
is
the
word
from
container...
it
avoids
the
basic
theoretical
weaknesses
of
arms-length
separate
accounting,
such
as
giving
the
taxpayer
the
chance
for
manipulations
through
tax
havens
and
this
sort
of
thing.
through
the
arms-length
method,
the
federal
government...
and
this
is
on
much
congressional
discussion
and
everything
else...
the
federal
government
is
having
a
terrible
time
trying
to
use
the
arms-length
method,
trying
to
catch
up
with
taxpayers
and
enforce
the
federal
tax.
the
states'
approach
of
worldwide
combined
reporting,
all
the
taxpayer
needs
to
provide,
basically,
is
the
california
and
worldwide
respectively
property,
payroll,
and
sales,
and
the
worldwide
net
income.
any
business
is
going
to
keep
track
of
those
things,
no
matter
how
many
countries
they're
in.
that's
the
sort
of
thing
they
keep
track
of
for
their
own
taxpayers,
for
any
filings
they
might
have
to
make
with
the
united
states
sec
if
they're
going
to
be
selling
any
shares
of
stock
in
the
united
states.
these...
this
is
information
that
they
will
have.
and
as
the
court
of
appeal
below
has
held
in
barclays,
the
california
system
provides
for
a
user-friendly
system
of
reasonable
approximations
where
the
franchise
tax
board
is
to
look
at
the
financial
records
of
the
corporation
and
work
from
there,
if
at
all
possible,
open
to
any
time
that
the
taxpayer
wants
to
come
in
with
its
actual
refiguring
under
the
exact
technical
determinations
of
the
system,
if
they
don't
want
to
use
the
reasonable
approximations.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
$2
million
and
$5
million--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--they...
that
was
a--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--exactly,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
the
california
court
of
appeal
has
held
is
a
reasonable
system,
and
that--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--as
the
testimony
indicates,
it
would
be
a
substantial
burden
whether
it
was
foreign
parented
or
domestic
parented,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
well,
it's
that
if
they
were
going
to
do...
everybody
has
those
figures
in
their
financial
accounting
records
which,
as
the
court
of
appeal
has
held,
the
board
of
franchise...
the
franchise
tax
board
has
to
consider
those
in
applying
the
reasonable
approximations
approach.
if
the
taxpayer
says
it's
going
to
cost
us
too
much
to
go
set
up...
and
this
is
what
the
$2
million,
$5
million
things...
assessments
were...
set
up
separate
books
in
every
county
or
every
nation,
every
subdiv...
subsidiary
is
going
to
have
a
separate
set
of
books
for
california
taxes.
the
franchise
tax
board
has
never
required
that.
we've
looked
at
our
requirements
and
we
say,
yes,
that
would
be
a
substantial
burden
upon
you,
so
you
may
use
reasonable
accounting.
and
in
this
particular
case
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
on
the
record
that
barclays
bank
was
deprived
of
any
benefit
or
of
any
injury
at
all
through
the
california
system.
they
claim
risks,
but
as
this
court
in
complete
auto
transit
indicates,
just
a
claiming
of
a
risk
of
discrimination
is
not
enough;
you
have
to
show
there's
some
injury,
and
they
have
not
done
that.
i
would
like
to
mention
the
taxpayers
and
the
executive
branch
approach
to
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
where
they
would
give
determinative
weight,
under
varying
circumstances,
depending
on
which
person
you're
listening
to,
to
the
bind...
to
federal
pronouncements
under...
as
a
binding
federal
one
voice
commerce
clause
policy
that
could
somehow
preempt
the
states.
but
this
would...
this
is
not
truly
a
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis,
because
in
a
dormant
context
you
cannot
have
such
a
binding
federal
policy.
it's...
a
very
similar
argument
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
wardair
case
where
the
executive
branch,
the
solicitor
general
argued
that
a
resolution
of
icao,
which
is
an
international
body,
expressed
the
international
policy
which
the
executive
branch
joined
in,
that
should
be
determinative
in
that
case.
and
this
court
looked
at
that
resolution
and
said,
well,
this
is
a...
this
is
a
common
aspiration
that's
being
voiced
here
of
the
body,
but
this
court
rejected
any
policy
significance
for
this
resolution
because
it
had
no
force
of
law.
executive
branch
pronouncement
must
have
the
force
of
law
before
it
can
possibly
preempt
the
states'
power
to
tax,
which
this
court
most
recently
in
oregon
v.
acf
held
that
this...
the
power
to
tax
is
central
to
state
sovereignty.
the
constitution
provides
a
very
carefully
crafted
system
of
federalism
with
the
states
having
certain
protections
within
that
federal
system.
by
giving
the
power
to
control
or
to
regulate
commerce
to
congress
and
by
setting
forth
procedural
rules
like
the
two-thirds
vote
required
for
senate
approval
of
any
treaty,
the
constitution
has
forged
a
balance
between
the
national
need
for
a
capability
of
imposing
a
uniform
commerce
policy
on
the
states
and
the
need
under
federalism
for
the
states
to
have
a
voice,
through
their
elected
representatives,
in
the
formation
of
any
such
policy.
in
contrast--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--well,
the
constitution
gives
that
job
to
congress,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
congress
has
certainly...
i'll...
let
me
shift
now
to
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis,
because
i
think
we've
just...
we
have
to
get
there.
the
congress
is
given
the
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce,
and
the...
container
has
established
that
in
a
dormant,
truly
dormant
one
voice
situation,
the
question
is
is
uniformity
of
the
state
tax
practice
with
the
federal
tax
practice
essential.
and
we
submit
that
this
question
as
to
whether
the
basic
commerce
clause
interests
require
uniformity
of
the
state
and
federal
tax
practices
is
a
question...
one
this
court
has
testing,
and
should
look
at
under
current
circumstances.
this
is
because
we
view
this
court
in
a
dormant
one
voice
situation
where
the
one
voice
has
not
spoken,
as
a
sort
of
one
voice
police
that
can
do
what
congress
might
do
if
congress
had
a
full
chance
to
do
it.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
certainly.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
i--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--i--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--i...
it
depends
on
what
you
say
the
one
voice
is.
we
say
that
in
commerce
clause
area,
congress
is
the
branch
that
has
the
one
voice.
there
can
be
no
binding
policy
by
any
other...
any
other
branch
of
the
policy--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
if
the
court
looks
to
the
facts--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--that's
our
basic
argument.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
well,
if
congress
has
spoken
and
said--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
and
that...
well,
i
will
have
to
rely
upon
this
court's
ruling
in
container
that
that,
by
itself,
is
not
congress
voicing
the
one
voice
of
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
in
container
specifically
disclaimed
any
significance
of
that
in
its
determination
of
the
one
voice
issue.
congress
had
to
choose
some
method
of
taxation
for
federal
purposes,
but
that
does
mean
that
congress--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--yes,
they
did,
just
as...
as
in
the
treaties,
they
disabled
themselves
from
using
the
unitary
business
approach,
but
enabled
the
states
to
do
so.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
but
when
congress
acts
in
a...
well,
that...
i'm
giving
our
argument
and
you
may
be
giving
your
views.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
well,
that's
what
i...
let's
assume--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--i
mean,
to
do
that,
we
must
assume,
arguendo,
that
congress
has
not
spoken.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
to
permit
or
prevent.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
this
particular
issue,
that's
right.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
um--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--actually,
what
congress
has
said
in
the
statutes...
the
statutes
would
permit
congress
to
use
a
formulary
system
very,
very
similar
to
what
california's
doing.
the
tax...
the
tax
treaties
with
the
foreign
governments
have
limited
the
federal
nation,
but
when
they've
done
that
they've
made
clear...
they've
been
very
careful
to
leave
the
state
out
of
it.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
so
if
you
look
at
the
federal
tax
statute,
it
is
very
broad
and
permits
many
types
of
approaches.
but
in
this
situation
where
we're
assuming
now
that
congress
hasn't
acted
to
prevent
or
permit,
you
have
the
long
legislative
history
before
congress
that
the
issue
has
been
presented
to
congress
many
many
times
in
a
highly
visible
fashion,
sometimes
by
the
administration,
to
ban
or
prevent
or
restrict
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting.
it's
come
with
much
expressions
of...
the
foreign
complaints
that
are
being
voiced
to
the
court
today
have
been
voiced
and
directed
at
congress
and
quoted
by
congress.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
no.
and
in
a
dormant
situation,
all
we're
looking
at
is
whether...
whether--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--uniformity
is
essential.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
what...
the
point
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
that
if
congress
has
indicated
that
not
acquiescence,
not
a
permission
that
would
completely
give
the
states
all
rights
under
the
commerce
clause
to
do,
you
know,
worldwide
combined
reporting,
even
if
it
might
violate
discrimination
or
anything
else...
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
if
congress
has
indicated
that
through
it's
inaction...
here
we
are
talking
about
inaction.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
no,
no,
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
dormant.
they...
when
they
have
indicated
inact...
through
their
inaction
that
the
uniformity
is
not
essential,
it
would
usurp
congress'
role
as
the
regulator
of
commerce
under
the
constitution
for
this
court
to
step
in
and
impose
its
own
notions
of
what
might
be
uniform
or
might
be
required
for
uniformity
in
a
case
where
congress
has
shown
through
the
decades
and
all
of
this,
you
know,
congressional
activity,
that
uniformity
is
not
essential.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
i'm
sorry.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
got
it.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes,
all
right--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--i...
what
i
say
is
that
the
court
needs
to
look
at
what
the
situation
is.
if
that
were
the
situation,
the
court
needs
to
apply
the
standards
of
one
voice
as
this
court
has
developed
them,
as--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--no,
we
would
win,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
because--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--what...
we
would
win
because
it
has
not
been
established
by
the
taxpayers
that
uniformity
is
essential,
and
that
there
are--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--and
that
the
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting,
they
have
not
shown
that
it
implicates
foreign
affairs
in
the
manner
in
which
the
container
case
looked
at
such
a
situation.
what--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--well,
in
our
situation,
we--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--no,
no,
i
have
not...
i
have
not
meant
to
say
that.
if
i
have,
i
would
retract
it.
the
court
has
to
apply
the
standards
that
it
did
in
container,
look
to
the
foreign
complaints
that
are
being
made,
determine
whether
it's
truly
implicating
foreign
affairs
or
not.
if
the
court
here
looks
at
the
complaints
that
are
made
in
this
case
by
the
foreign
governments,
what
the
court
will
hear
is
a
complete
rehash
of
the
arguments
which
this
court
flatly
rejected
in
container.
i
mean,
the
foreign
governments
simply
will
not
agree
with
this
court,
or
let
on
that
they
agree
that
this
court
has
held
that
worldwide
combined
reporting
is
proper
and
fair,
and
that
it
apportions
income
in
a
fair
manner.
as
in
allied
signal
this
court
recognized
that
it
does
a
better
job
of
apportioning
values
between
parts
of
a
unitary
business
than
arms-length
separate
accounting
does.
what
you're
hearing
from
the
foreign
governments
is
just
the
same
complaints
you
heard
in
container.
and
it's...
i
submit
that
this
court
has
given
the
foreign
governments
a
chance
to
come
up
with
something
new
and
they
have
not.
so...
but
that,
in
another
context,
perhaps
foreign
governments
could
provide,
and
the
taxpayers
could
argue,
that
there
is
a
true
implication
of
foreign
affairs.
here
if
the
foreign
governments
were
really
arguing
what
their
real
interests
are,
what
they
would
be
telling
this
court
is
we
want
california
to
be
bound
to
the
same
arms-length
approach
that
the
states
are...
or
that
the
federal
government
is,
because
the
federal
government
cannot
possibly
administer
that
tax
and
our
taxpayers
can
find
ways
of
manipulating
their
books
to
get
around
it.
we
would
be
hearing
we
like
to
provide
tax
havens
to
our
taxpayers.
and
so
if
the
california
method
is
taken
away...
the
ability
to
impose
worldwide
combined
reporting
is
taken
away
from
the
states,
we
won't
have
to
worry
about
that
anymore
and
the
tax
havens
can
continue
to
be
just
as
effective
as
they
are
with
the
federal
government.
no
matter
how
hard
the
federal
government
tries
to
enforce
arms-length
separate
accounting,
what
it
is
doing
is
gradually
getting
as
close
as
possible
to
a
global
formulary
apportionment
of
income,
as
can
be
done
under
the
treaties
that
restrict
it
to
arms
length.
so
the
federal...
the
foreign
governments'
complaints
really
are
just
a
rehash
of
what
this
court
has
already
rejected
in
container.
and
the
united
kingdom,
of
course,
has
put
a
retaliatory
statute
on
its
books,
and
it
will
brandish
that
statute
for
dramatic
effect
whenever
it
feels
that
it's
appropriate,
and
yet
it
hasn't
ever
implemented
that
statute.
and,
of
course,
the
reason
is
clear.
the
federal
government
has
testified
before
congress
that
implementation
of
that
statute
by
the
united
kingdom
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty
which
the
u.k.
bargained
for
and
signed
onto
knowing
that
it
had
been
unsuccessful
in
its
attempts
to
have
the
states
barred
from
using
worldwide
combined
reporting.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
as
to
our
arguments
on
the
executive
branch...
excuse
me,
as
to...
back
now
to
the
nondormant
side,
the
executive
branch
actions
have
confirmed
that
congress
has
acquiesced
in
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting.
no
matter
what
their
statements
might
be...
they
might
well
be
jawboning
as
the
solicitor
general
says...
they
executive
branch's
actual
statements...
or,
excuse
me,
actual
actions
show...
like
when
they
drafted
their
own
model
income
tax
treaty,
they
made
it
very
clear
that
the
national
government
would
be
subjected
to
the
arms-length
restrictions,
but
the
states
would
not.
when
the
foreign
model
treaties
are
drafted
by
the
oecd,
why
the
federal
government...
the
executive
branch
has
entered
formal
reservations
to
those
treaties.
when
after
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty,
the
other
foreign
governments
wanted
the
executive
branch
to
negotiate
the
same
sort
of
ban
on
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting
as
it
had
in
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty,
the
executive
branch
pointed
to
the
actions
of
the
senate
and
said,
no,
we
will
not
do
that;
it
would
not
be
successful
in
the
congress.
the
executive
branch,
when
it
has
wanted
to
change
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting,
has
not
tried
to
issue
its
own
federal...
clear
federal
directive
prohibiting
the
states'
use.
it
has,
instead,
gone
to
congress
and
asked
for
congress
to
change
the
rule
as
it
applies
now
permitting
the
states.
the
issue
has
been
fought
through
in
the
u.s.
u.k.
treaty
and
the
issue
has
been
on
the
table
in
dozens
and
dozens
of
other
income
tax
treaties,
bilateral
treaties.
the
state
of
california,
by
using
worldwide
combined
reporting,
is
only
doing
what
these
treaties
permit
the
states
to
do,
and
nothing
that
the
executive
branch
or
the
foreign
governments
or
the
taxpayers
can
say
or
do
can
negate
this
congressional
acquiescence
in
the
state
tax.
i
might
point
out
that
the
1993
california
legislation,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
is
the
culmination
of
a
campaign
by
the
executive
branch
for
the
states
to
adopt
a
compromise
solution,
the
water's
edge
approach,
which
contains
both
worldwide
combined
reporting
elements
and
separate
accounting
elements.
and
since
that
tax
law
has
been
inserted
in
1993,
which
amended
a
1986
statute,
the
united
kingdom
has
withdrawn
its
threats
of
retaliation
for
the
moment
and
has
recognized...
at
least
impliedly
recognized
that
such
retaliation
would
not
be
justifiable
at
this
point.
so
in
the
dormant
commerce
clause
context--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--that
is
correct.
politically,
would
that
happen?
probably
not.
but
what
we're
dealing
with
is
a
political
question
that
should
be
submitted
to
congress,
that
has
been
submitted
to
congress.
congress
has
acted
to
permit
the
states'
use
of
worldwide
combined
reporting.
even
if
it
has
not...
if
it's
assumed
that
congress
has
not,
congress
has
at
least
indicated
that
uniformity
of
the
state
tax
practice,
in
a
dormant
commerce
clause
context
with
the
federal
tax
practice,
is
not
essential,
which
should
end
this
court's...
any
of
this
court's
considerations
under
a
dormant
commerce
clause
context.
i
would...
thank
you
very
much.
