justice

o'connor
well,
mr.
dreeben,
if
you...
if
you
prevail
here,
if
the
petitioner
prevails,
and
not
only
gender-based
peremptory
strikes
but
those
based
on
ethnic
origin,
religion
and
so
forth,
are
similarly
barred,
what's
left
of
the
peremptory
challenge
system,
if
anything?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
besides
the
postmen.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
strikes
me
that
before
you
even
get
to
that,
you're
going
to
be
accused...
as
a
lawyer,
a
trial
lawyer
exercising
peremptories
which,
of
necessity,
have
to
be
exercised
against
either
women
or
men...
of
having
made
a
sex-based
peremptory
strike.
how
do
you
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
trial
judge
should
deal
with
it?
suppose
the
lawyer
strikes...
has
five
peremptory
strikes
and
uses
three
of
them
to
strike
women.
now,
is
that
open
to
challenge
and
is
the
trial
judge
going
to
have
to
resolve
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
might.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but,
of
course,
what
do
you
have
there?
you
have
a
much
smaller
pool
of
minority
jurors
against
which
this
can
operate,
so
it
strikes
me
that
it's
much
easier
to
establish
some
kind
of
a
misuse.
but
when
you
have
equal
numbers
of
men
and
women,
it
seems
that
it
might
be,
as
a
practical
matter,
very
difficult
to
administer
this
for
the
trial
judge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
long
were
women
kept
off
juries
in
alabama?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
brasfield,
i
guess
the
court
has
painted
itself
into
a
bit
of
a
corner
on
this
matter,
because
it
has
held
that
the
batson
rule
applies
because
of
the
right
of
the
juror.
that
it
is
the
juror's
own
rights
that
are
at
stake
here,
and
that
the
attorney
for
the
litigant
can
raise
that
challenge
in
the
case.
now,
if
that's
so,
then
how...
how
would
you
not
apply
that
rule
to
a
gender-based
strike?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
what's
really
at
stake
is
the
right
of
the
juror.
if
the
court's
theory
had
been
different,
your
argument
might
be
easier.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
how
can
you
make
a
reasonable
argument
in
light
of
the
court's
jurisprudence
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
a
particular
juror
has
a
right
to
have
the
state
not
act
to
exclude
them
on
the
basis
of
their
gender,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
but
based
on
the
right
of
the
juror?
