anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
suppose
an
attorney
were
faced
with
a
jury
of
all
one
gender,
all
male
or
all
female,
could
the
attorney
then
strike
in
order
to
increase
diversity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
porter--
--so
the
stereotype
applies
to
the
challenge
but
not
to
the
evaluation
of
the
jury
as
it's
composed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
arguing
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
a
counsel
that's
continuing
to
exclude
them
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
gender?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
yes,
you
are.
you're
saying
it's
perfectly
constitutional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
a
right
not
to
be
a
struck.
it's
a
right
not
to
be
stricken
according
to
your
race
or,
in
this
case
the
argument
is
gender.
no
one's
contending
that
you
have
a
right
not
be
subjected
to
a
challenge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
the
reason
for
the
challenge
that's
the
point
of...
the
point
of
the
inquiry
here.
