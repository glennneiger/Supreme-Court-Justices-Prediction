mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
solution
that
the
defendant...
the
petitioner
has
offered
in
this
case
i
think
causes
a
great
many
more
problems
than
it
actually
fixes.
in
this
particular
case
there...
it
was
a
very
unusual
venire.
and
under
the
circumstances,
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
said
that
either
the
defendant,
the
individual
jurors,
or
the
community
at
large
was
harmed.
usually,
you
will
have
a
fairly
well
divided
venire,
and
in
this
particular
case
there
were
23
women
and
10
men
for
whom...
that
had
to
be
brought
down
to
a
12-person
jury.
the
defendant
had
11
strikes,
the
state
had
10.
the
jury--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--this
is
a
civil
case
completely,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
they
use
a
struck
jury
method
which
is
24...
a
minimum
of
24
are
required
from
which
to
start
the
striking
down
to
the
number
of
jurors
that
are
going
to
be
needed.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
no,
no,
no.
you
have
however
many
it
takes
to
reduce
the
venire
to
the
number
of
jurors
who
are
actually
needed
for
the
trial.
that
will
be--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--in
this
case
it
was
12.
there
were
no
alternates
needed
for
this
case.
so
it
just
happened
that
there
were
a
large
number
of
strikes
to
be
used
in
this
case.
the
defendant
used
his
first
strike
against
a
woman;
the
state
used
its
first
strike
against
a
man.
this--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--yes,
sir.
and--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--the
statute
requires
that
a
minimum
of
24
be
available.
usually
more
than
that
are
called
because
there...
there's
never
any
way
of
knowing
how
many
will
be
struck
for
cause
prior
to
the
striking
of
the
actual
jury.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
the
state
used
its
fourth
strike
to
strike
a
woman,
but
the
defendant
continued
to
use
his
strikes...
i
mean
to
strike
a
man,
but
the
defendant
continued
to
use
her
to
strike
women.
the
actual
numbers
struck
were
11
women
and
10
men.
those
jurors
who
were
struck,
those
11
women
and
10
men,
did
not
leave
the
courtroom
thinking
that
they
had
been
excluded
from
the
jury
system
or
that
they
could
never
sit
on
a
jury.
both
men
and
women
regularly
sit
on
juries
throughout
this
country.
and
part
of
that
is
the
very
fact
that
men
and
women
are
not
minorities;
they
are
both
fairly
equal
in
numbers.
so
that
if
your
panel
is
drawn
randomly,
usually
you
will
have
a
jury
panel
that
is
fairly
equal
in
numbers.
if
there
is
some
reason
why
the
litigants
feel
like
it's
to
their
advantage
to
strike
one
gender
rather
than
the
other
one,
then
just
in
this
case
the
other
juror...
other
litigant
is
probably
going
to
be
striking
the
other
gender.
this
was
a
rare
but
totally
random
drawing
that
produced
an
unbalanced
venire.
but
in
most
cases
this
would
not
happen.
in...
and
the
fact
is
that
they
could
have
just
as
well
been
two
men
to
every
woman.
it
just
happened
that
it
was
two
women
to
every
man
in
this
case.
in
addition--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
would
not
have
been
a
prima
facie
case
which
would
have
caused
a
challenge
if
batson
had
been
applied
to
this
case.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
yes.
i
think
at
this
point
the
fact
that
there
would
be
a
prima
facie
case
if
either
side
had
decided
to
challenge.
the
state
had
as
much
of
a
challenge
against
the
defendant
for
having
stricken
10
women
with
his
11
strikes.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
in
my
position,
i
think
that
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
batson
was
based
on.
but
batson
has
been
held
to
be
uniquely
a
result
of
the
racial
situation
that
was
existing
in
this
country,
where
blacks
were
still
being
kept
off
of
juries
in
case
after
case
after
case,
and
the
swain
test
that
was
in
place
was
unworkable
to
prove
that
this
was
happening.
it's
our
position
that
it's--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--until
1966,
they
were.
under
the
statute,
a
jury
was
made
up
of
all
males.
but
at
this
point,
they
are
not
being
kept
off
of
juries.
the
venire
lists
are
drawn
from
the
driver's
license
registration
lists,
and
are
drawn
at
random.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
right
or
wrong.
i'm
saying--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--i'm
saying...
i'm
not...
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
i
think
it
is
constitutional.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessarily
to
either
party's
advantage.
i
think
they
may
very
well
be
wrong,
just
as
they
may
be
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
postman
is
going
to
be
less
likely
to
decide
on
their
case.
but--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--not
at
all,
sir.
i
think
there
was
a
very--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--yes.
but
i
think
that
batson
is
unique
to
race
and
the
situation
that
was
continuing
to
exist
in
that
blacks
were
being
kept
out
of
the
system,
which
is
not
happening
to
men
in
particular
in
this
case,
or
women.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
i
don't
think--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--well--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--well,
i
think
that
no
particular
juror
has
a
right
to
sit
on
any
particular
case.
and
in
this
situation
there
were
12
women
who
sat
on
the
jury,
but
there
were
11
women
who
didn't.
and
they
were
struck...
as
i
said,
there
would
have
been
a
prima
facie
against
that
at
the
time
too.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
that
has
not
been
said
by
this
court
up
until
now.
all
of
the
applications
of
batson,
at
this
point,
have
been
to
race.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
then
i
think
you
would
have
to
come
also
to
the
right
of
the
postman
and
the
right
of
anybody
else
not
to
be
struck.
and
if
we
are
going
to
reach
this,
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
problems
that
extending
batson
beyond
the
area
of
race
would
cause,
and
that--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--but
is
it--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--but
i
think
that
the
same
argument,
if
that
is
going
to
be
used
to
extend
batson,
would
also
apply
to
any
other
stereotypical
reason
for--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--justice
ginsburg,
it
is
true
that
only
blacks
and
women
have,
been
under
the
law,
denied
the
right,
and
that
actually
black
men
were
allowed
to
sit
on
juries
prior
to
women
in
alabama.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
but
they
are
there,
and
they
are
there
in
fairly
equal
numbers.
and
since
we're
in
the
position
of
applying
it
to
both
men
and
women,
there
is
always
the
chance
that...
and
particularly
where
you
have
a
large
black
population
too,
the
problem
is
extended
and
made
more
necessary,
that
you
have
a
reason
for
every
strike
in
the
event
that
you
inadvertently
fall
into
a
situation
that
makes
you
subject
to
a
challenge.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
i
think
that--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--i
think
that
that
argument
could
be
extended
in
that
direction,
yes.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
i
think
that
we
would
certainly
be
in
a
position
where
we
couldn't
use...
striking
a
jury
because
we
don't
like
the
look
in
his
eye
as
our
nonracial,
non-gender-based
reason--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--because
it
would
be
considered
a
sham.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--that
is
also
correct.
and
while
in
alabama
if
you
were
having
a
batson
challenge
and
you
were
trying
to
justify
your
strike
for
a
nonracial
reason,
or
a
non-gender-based
reason,
i
think
that
saying,
your
honor,
i
didn't
like
the
look
in
his
eye
would
not
pass
muster.
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
show
a
better
reason
that
than,
or
it
would
be
considered
a
sham.
you
could
say
that
about
every
person
you
had
struck.
so
i
think
that
you
would
be
required
to
extend
your
voir
dire
and
spend
much
more
time.
now,
i
think
that
the
judicial
system
would
be
loaded
up
with
time
spent
questioning
jurors
to
be
sure
that
you'd
be
able
to
give
a...
an
acceptable
reason
if
you
were
called
upon
to
do
so.
i
think--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--i
am
not
familiar
with
whether
those
problems
have
been
found.
the...
mr.
dreeben
has
said
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
are
problems.
i'm
not...
also
not
sure
that
there
are
not...
there
are
any
studies
showing
there
are
not
problems.
but,
now,
in
alabama,
although
alabama
has
heartily
endorsed...
all
of
its
courts
have
endorsed
batson
as
it
applies
to
race,
and
in
each
of
its
extensions
to
civil
litigation
and
against
defendants
as
well
as
plaintiffs.
but
at
the
same
time,
there
were
over
40
appellate
opinions
issued
by
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
last
year
that
had
to
address
batson
issues
that
were
raised
on
appeal.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
agree
with
that.
i
also
think
that
if
batson
were
extended
to
gender,
there
is
a
clear
indication
that
it
would
cause
problems
in
alabama
and
in
many
states.
i
can't
believe
that
alabama
is
unique
in
struggling
with
the
practical
application
of
batson
even
as
it
applies
to
race,
as...
and
i
think
that
having
it
to
apply
to
gender
also
would
increase
the
problems
tremendously.
in
paternity
cases,
for
instance,
which
is
what
i
see
regularly,
alabama
adjudicated
8,000
paternities
last
year.
most
of
these
trials
take
no
more
than
half
a
day,
even
when
you're
selecting
a
jury.
they're
quickly
handled.
they
have...
usually
they
have
some
expert
testimony
and
some
hla
or
dna
tests,
and
they
are
fairly
rapidly
decided.
you
can...
it
can
be
envisioned
that
you'd
spend
twice
as
long
on
the
voir
dire
and
jury
selection
as
you
would
actually
trying
the
cases.
in
addition,
i
think
there
would
be
a
lot
greater
chance
for
an
allegation
of
error
in
those
cases,
so
that
the
appeals
system
would
be
overloaded
as
well
with
batson
issues.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
the
fact
pattern
in
this
case--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--this
is
the
first
case
that
i
have
seen
where
that
type
of
striking
has
been
apparent.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
so
this
is
not
necessarily.
it
is
certainly
not
something
that
has
been
advised
by
the
state.
it
was
apparently
this
particular
litigator's...
the
two
litigators'
choices.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
the
only
thing
that
would
make
it
unmanageable
is
that
the...
if
you
reduced
either
side.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
there
is
all
of
one
panel
or
all
of
another,
or
if
all
of
the
strikes
are
used,
because
this
court
and
the
state's
court...
state
courts
have
held
that
if
even
one
strike
appears
to
be
based
on
gender
or
can
show
a
prima
facie
case--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--no,
not
that
one
strike
of
one
person
would.
but
if
you
have
six
or
eight
strikes,
or
five
or
nine
strikes--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--they
are
one--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--you
know,
at
what
point
would
you
decide
you've
crossed
the
line?
if
you're
using,
say,
two
more
strike
against
one
gender
than
the
other
in
alabama,
the
state
courts
have
held
that
if
you
reduce
a
racial
ratio
in
the
venire
significantly
when
reaching
the
petit
jury,
that
that,
in
itself,
can
be
a
prima
facie
case.
so
that
you're
really
in
a
position
where
you
might
have
to
have
a
proportional
jury
in
order
to
avoid
a
batson
challenge,
or
you
would
have
to
be
prepared
to
give
a
reason
for
each
one
of
your
strikes
if
you
didn't
have
a
proportional
jury.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
yes,
justice
stevens.
in
this
case
there
were
36
on
the
original
panel;
three
of
them
were
struck
for
cause
by
the
court.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
that's
right.
that
doesn't
enter
into
it.
the
actual
peremptory
strikes
begin
after
the
removal
of
the
people
who
are
struck
for
cause.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
the
proportion
of
minorities
to
the
majority
race
on
the
venire
is
considered
as
one
of
the
elements.
it's
not
the
only
one;
in
individual
cases
they
might
consider
other
matters.
but
there
have
been
cases
in
which
the
very
fact
that
either
more
strikes
were
used
against
the
minority
than
against
the
majority
or
that
the
result
was
that...
for
instance,
if
you
had
eight
strikes
and
you
used
two
of
them
against
blacks,
but
there
were
only
two
blacks
in
the
panel,
and
so...
or
three
blacks
in
the
panel...
so
that
you
reduced
the
proportion
considerably,
that
would
be
one
of
the
things
they
would
look
at
in
determining
a
prima
facie
case.
that,
in
itself,
could
be
considered
a
prima
facie
case.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
i
think
that
that
is
true.
i
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
other
way
to
handle
it,
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
what
that
could
be
as
far
as...
as
applying
batson,
how
that
could
be
done.
now,
there
are
other
situations
that
have
been
done.
one
thing
i
want
to
mention
is
that
as
well
as
the
community
at
large
not
being
harmed,
because
men
and
women
both
sit
on
the
juries,
and
because
these
particular
men
and
women
did
not
feel
excluded
from
the
system
because,
they
probably
sat
on
another
jury
during
the
same
term
of
court,
and
because
they
were
actually
struck
in
fairly
equal
numbers,
the
fact
is
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
overwhelming
evidence
that
was
there,
it
is
very
hard
to
see
how
the
defendant
could
be
harmed.
because
i
don't
think
he
was
found
to
be
the
father
of
this
child
because
of
a
biased
all-female
jury;
i
think
he
was
found
to
be
the
father
of
this
child
because
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
that
he
is.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
yes,
your
honor.
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
i
think,
but
i
feel
that
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
first
place
they
are
struck
by
number
and
the
jurors
don't
know
what
their
number
is.
if
one
side
is
striking
men
and
the
other
side
is
striking
women
and
then
are
reduced
in
equal
numbers,
then
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
be
harmed
by
that
knowledge.
i
think
that
part
of
our
problem
in
alabama
may
be
contributed
to
by
the
fact
that
we
use
the
struck
jury
method,
which
gives
us
this
basically
unlimited
number
of
strikes,
limited
only
by
the
number
that's
on
the
panel
to
begin
with.
the
state
of
alabama
bar
association
has
already
recognized
that
alabama
is
having
problems
and
is
having
too
many
appeals
on
this
issue,
and
they
have
appointed
a
panel
of...
a
committee
of
judges
and
lawyers
to
examine
alabama's
jury
system
and
see
if
going
to
a
different
or
a
revised
peremptory
strike
method,
such
as
is
used
in
the
federal
courts
or
some
other
court,
might
alleviate
a
lot
of
the
problem.
i
think
that
there
are
other
states
who
don't
seem
to
be
having
particular
problems
with
batson
or
with
gender
strikes,
and
have
been
able
to
work
this
out.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
then
i
think
alabama
deserves
an
opportunity
to
try
to
fix
that,
if
that
is
what
is
happening.
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
i
think
there
would
be
an
impetus
to
go
to
proportional
juries
or
do
away
with
the
peremptory
strike.
i
think
it
could
come...
become
so
complicated
that--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--uh--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--but
i--
ms.
lois
n.
brasfield
--yes,
that
is
what
i
said,
but
i
do
think
that
because
it
is
already
the...
the
problem
of
gender
strikes
in
alabama
is
not
a
pervasive
problem,
that
the
state
should
have
the
opportunity
to
try
to
correct
it
on
its
own.
and
mr.
dreeben
seems
to
think
that
there
is
a
problem
in
the
federal
system,
also.
if
that
is
true,
i
think
that
this
court's
supervisory
powers
could
well
allow
this
court
to
cure
that
system
without
reaching
the
states
in
your
level.
i
think
that
applying
batson
to
gender
in
the
situation
that
alabama
has
at
this
point
would
cause
great
slowdown
of
the
cases
moving
through
the
courts,
and
would
raise
more
problems
than
it
could
possibly
cure.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
