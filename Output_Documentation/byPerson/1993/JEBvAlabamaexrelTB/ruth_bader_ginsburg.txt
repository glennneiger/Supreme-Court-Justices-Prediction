but
men,
as
a
class,
historically
have
not
been
excluded
from
jury
service,
so
why
should
an
equal
protection
plea
on
behalf
of
men
succeed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
couldn't
this
be
regarded
as
a
kind
of
affirmative
action
for
women
to
make
up
for
all
the
years
when
alabama
totally
excluded
them
from
jury
service?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
porter,
isn't
it
clear
that
there's
something
to
most
stereotypes,
that
most
stereotypes
are,
indeed,
accurate
for
a
good
part
of
the
class?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
argument
is
that
you
want
a
precedent
that
applies
to
race
to
be
extended
to
sex.
how
far
do
you
carry
it?
what
other
groups?
and
if...
you're
saying
if
race,
then
sex.
well,
how
about
age,
religion,
national
origin?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
does
one
inquire
of
each
juror
about
the
legitimacy
of
the
juror's
birth?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or,
indeed,
national
origin?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
perhaps
the
difference
that
in
race
and
sexes,
you
don't
have
to
ask.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
you
have
standing
because
of
the
client
that
you
represent,
which
you're
asserting,
then,
is
the
equal
protection
right
of
the
juror,
not
the
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
that
the
heart
of
your
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
porter,
are
you
going
to,
in
your
system
where
we
have
these
groups,
allow
the
preliminary
questioning
of
the
potential
jurors.
in
the
colloquy
that
we
just
had,
you
observed
that
there's
something
about
race
and
sex
that's
not
like
any
other
class.
you
don't
have
to
ask.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
suggestions
that
you're
now
making,
the
notion
that
religion
is
not
written
on
someone's
forehead
so
we
would
first
have
to
quiz
the
potential
jurors
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
same
thing
with
national
origin.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that...
does
not...
isn't
that
just
a
disturbing
thought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
we
accepted
your
argument
that
sex
should
be
treated
like
race,
wouldn't
it
be
appropriate
in
this
case
to
follow
another
precedent
that
was
set
27
years
in
alabama,
and
that
is
not
to
make
this...
this
dramatic
change
retroactive.
do
you
remember
the
old
case
of
white
against
crook
when
the
alabama
legislature
was
given
till
the
next
session
to
put
women
on
juries?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
was
certainly
so
in
the
days
when
the
alabama
laws
was...
that
the
jury
role
would
include
the
names
of
all
male
citizens
of
the
county.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
that
was
made
prospective
only.
the
relief
was
made
prospective
only.
why
isn't
that
appropriate
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
are
we
talking
entirely
hypothetically?
is
it
not
so
that
batson
is
the
rule
with
respect
to
sex
in
some
federal
jurisdictions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
there
was
not
proof
that
the
elimination
was,
indeed,
gender
based?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's...
i
thought
that
that
was
a
given
for
us
at
this
level.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brasle...
brasfield,
my
question
to
you...
we've
been
talking
about
stereotyping
and
how
they
are
often
true
for
most
people
in
the
class,
but
it
was
my
impression
that
the
evil
or
mischief
that
has
underlied
every
decision
of
this
court
in
the
sex
discrimination/equal
protection
field
is
just
that
stereotyping,
the
notion
that
women
are
this
way
and
men
are
that
way.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brasfield,
isn't
it
true
that
there's
no
other
group
in
the
history
of
this
country
that
was
excluded
from
jury
service
as
long
as
women?
not
even
the
racial
classifications
lasted
into...
in
fact,
it
was
1967
in
alabama;
the
decision
was
'66,
but
the
change
was
'67,--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
wouldn't
we
be
putting
the
peremptory
challenge
back
where
it
was
in
the
days
when
it
was
never
exercised
on
the
basis
of
either
race
or
sex
because
there
weren't
any
women
or
any
minorities
in
the
pool
to
begin
with?
so
all
this
talk
about
how
you're
shrinking
the
peremptories,
you're
just
putting
it
back
the
way
it
was
in
the
bad
old
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
about
letter
carriers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brasfield,
is
the
question
i
asked
earlier
to
mr.
dreeben,
i
think...
batson
is
in
effect
with
respect
to
sex
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
in
some
states.
is
there
any
evidence
of...
you
said
you
think...
do
we...
is
there
any
evidence
that
there
has,
in
fact,
been
these
intractable
problems?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
o'connor
explained
that
the...
one
of
the
problems
from
your
point
of
view
is
that
the
right
is
being
asserted
by
the
defendant,
but
the
constitutional
protection
is
afforded
to
the
potential
juror.
so
every
time
you're
talking
about,
well,
the
defendant
is
or
is
not
likely
to
be
affected,
it's
the...
it's
the
harm
to
the
potential
juror
as
a
result
of
stereotyping
because
of
one's
birth
status,
that's
the
constitutional
injury
that's
at
stake
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
there
is
a
constitutional
injury
and
it's
a
problem
of
the
mechanics
of
the
state
system
that
could
be
fixed,
as
seems
to
be
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
certainly,
there
would
be
an
impetus
to
fix
it
if
the
court
said
that
batson
applies
to
gender.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry,
i
wasn't...
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
you
correctly.
you
said
in
places
that
have...
don't
have
this
struck
jury
system,
like
the
federal
courts,
they
weren't
having
the
problems
with
implementing
batson,
either
for
sex
or
for
race,
the
way
alabama
is
because
it's
got
this
unusual
struck
juror
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
if
you...
if
you
fixed
the
way
your...
you
strike
jurors,
then
you
might
not
have
any
difficulty
administering
batson
for
race
or
for
sex.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that's
what
you
had
said.
