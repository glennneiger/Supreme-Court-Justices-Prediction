isn't
your
argument
that
certain
stereotyping,
whatever
its
historical
basis
in
fact
may
be,
simply
should
not
be
recognized
as
tolerable
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
don't
you
have
a
principle
argument
as
opposed
to
a
merely
fact
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your...
isn't
it
your
assumption,
in
answering
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
there
is
no
reason
to
infer
that
there
was
stereotyping
or
exclusion
based
on
stereotyping
in
composing
the
panel
from
which
his
all-male
jury
or
all-female
jury
was
picked?
isn't
that
your
assumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is,
in
fact,
i
presume,
an
unrealistic
assumption.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
would
be
in
those
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
ask
you,
in
the
trial
of
those
cases
is
the
fact
pattern
that
we've
seen
in
this
case
characteristic
of
most
of
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
defense
counsel
will
strike
all
of
one
sex
and
the
state's
counsel
strike
all
of
the
other
sex?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
this
isn't
necessarily
a
problem
here
for--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
that
sort
of
undercuts
the
reason
for
your
fear
that
if
we...
if
we
decide
in
the
petitioner's
favor
here,
that
your
prosecution
of
these
cases
is
going
to
be
made
unmanageable?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
appears
to
be.
but,
i
mean,
isn't
that
the...
doesn't
that
raise
a
question
about
the
nature
of
the
prima
facie
case.
as
so
members...
so
many
members
of
the
court
have
pointed
out,
you
can't
strike
anybody
without
striking
someone
of
one
gender
or
another,
and
therefore
you've
got
to
have
something
more
than
that
to
make
a
prima
facie
case.
you
had
a
prima
facie
case,
we
are
all
agreed,
i
guess,
here,
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
one
strike
of
one
person
is
going
to
appear
prima
facie
to
be
motivated
by
gender,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they
were
all
of
the
same
gender.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you've
got
one.
