chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
92-1239,
j.e.b.
v.
t.b.--
mr.
porter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
men
at
large
in
this
particular
community
really
felt
bad
because
male
jurors
had
been
stricken
from
this
panel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
the
local
newspaper
had
run
a
story
saying
that
these
male
jurors
had
been
excluded,
do
you
think
the
community
at
large
or
the
community
of
men
would
have
felt
very
badly
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
community
would
have
felt
differently
than
men
would
have
felt
about
it,
is
that
your
answer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
porter,
since
batson,
which
i
guess
was
7
years
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
seen
a
number
of
cases
here
in
which
batson
issues
have
been
raised
because
of
the
peremptories
directed
at
minorities,
of
blacks
or
hispanics.
under...
if
your
view
prevails,
a
person
making
any
sort
of
a
peremptory
challenge
in
a
proceeding
is
just
really
running
a
great
risk.
because
the
peremptory
challenge
is
going
to
be
even
to
a
man
or
to
a
woman,
and
therefore
arguable
on
appeal
that
this...
this
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you're
talking...
i
mean,
if
you're
talking
about
minority
members
of
a
jury
panel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
should
think
it
would
be
much
easier
to
make
out
a
case
like
that
because
there
are
not
apt
to
be
many
of
them
on
the
panel.
whereas
in
the
case
of
women
or
men
members,
they're
probably
going
to
be
50/50.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
porter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
ms.
brasfield,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
alabama
allows
in
a
criminal
case,
or
is
this
a
civil
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
allowed
10
or
11
strikes
in
a
civil
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
start
with
24
and
one
side
has
10
and
the
other
side
has
11--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
would
that
be
12
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
inquire
once
more
into
the
mechanics.
the
venire
was
33
people?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you...
where
did
the
number
24
come
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you
could
draw
the
line
short
of
that,
surely,
because
the
court
has
held
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
if
not
strict
scrutiny,
at
least
heightened
scrutiny,
intermediate
scrutiny
based
on
differences
between
men
and
women.
and
it
has
never
said
the
same
about
people
who
had
a
certain
look
in
their
eye.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
i
also
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
its
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
only
in
1992,
last
year,
so
it
might
be
too
soon
to
decide
whether
there've
been
any
problems
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brasfield.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-1239,
j.e.b.
versus
alabama
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
