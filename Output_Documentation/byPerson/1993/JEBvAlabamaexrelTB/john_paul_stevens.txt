mr.
porter,
the
male
and
female
classes
are
roughly
the
same
size,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
always
true
in
the
racial
or
other
contexts.
why
isn't
it
an
adequate
protection
if
one
side
thinks
the
male
is
a
more
favorable
juror
and
the
other
thinks
the
female,
give
them
each
the
same
number
of
peremptories
and
they'll
cancel
each
other
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
what's
the
damage
if
one
side
thinks
they
don't
like
men
and
the
other
side
thinks
they
don't
like
women?
doesn't
that
cancel
it
out?
i
mean
neither
group
is
being
treated
less
favorably
than
the
other
group
under
that
hypothesis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
men
and
women
would
be
insulted
because
they're
not
of
the
opposite
sex.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
by
retroactive
you
mean
the
cases
pending?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
procedure
in
alabama,
this
alternate
striking?
is
it
correct
that...
i
gather
a
lot
of
these
are
peremptory
strikes,
but
is
it
also...
and
it
must
be
true
also
that
you
can
have
strikes
for
cause
as
you
go
down
the
line,
and
not
have
those
counted
against
you,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and
the
person
just
doesn't
lose...
and
then
he
gets
another
strike
if
the
judge
agrees
with
him
on
the
strike
for
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
as...
would
you
describe
again
what
test
in
batson
cases
the
alabama
courts
are
now
using?
because,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
adopting
the
rule
that
the
petitioners
want
here,
would
be
to
compel
alabama
to
be
less
rigorous
in
its
application
of
batson.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
required
alabama
to
apply
such
a
rigorous
rule.
what
is
the
rule
they
now
use?
