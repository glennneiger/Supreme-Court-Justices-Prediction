mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
ruling
which
the
petitioner
requests
in
this
case
is
a
determination
that
gender-based
peremptory
jury
challenges
are
prohibited
under
the
heightened
scrutiny
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
such
that
the
procedures
established
in
batson
v.
kentucky
would
apply
in
that
context
also.
the
facts
which
are
relevant
to
the
review
of
this
case
reveal
that
from
a
panel
of
33
potential
jurors,
the
state
of
alabama
in
this
cause
struck
9...
used
9
of
its
strikes
to
strike
men
from
the
jury
and
used
1
of
its
strikes
to
strike
a
female.
the
petitioner
used
a
peremptory
strike
to
strike
a
male
from
the
jury,
resulting
in
an
all-female
panel
to
try
this
case,
which
resulted
in
a
determination
in
favor
of
the
state
of
paternity
in
this
action.
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
based
upon
three
factors.
the
first
is
that
the
same
principle
which
prohibits
gender-based
exclusion
from
the
jury
venire
also
excludes
gender-based
elimination
or
peremptory
strikes
in
the
formation
of
a
petit
jury.
secondly,
under
the
heightened
scrutiny
of
the
equal
protection
clause
applicable
to
gender
discrimination,
the
state's
interest
in
limiting
further
restrictions
on
the
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges
is
not
significant
enough
to
overcome
the
invidious
harm
caused
by
gender-based
peremptory
challenges.
and
finally,
the
harm
to
the
petitioner,
the
excluded
jurors,
and
society
as
a
whole
is
substantially
similar
in
the
use
of
gender-based
peremptory
challenges
as
that
we
find
from
race-based
peremptory
challenges.
the
fact
that
this
panel
ended
up
being
all
female
simply
highlights
the
injury
to
the
entire
community
when
a
group,
such
as
males
or
females,
were
eliminated
from
the
jury
panel
because
of
group
bias
or
unwarranted
stereotyping,
and
when
those...
that
stereotyping
becomes
the
basis
for
the
exclusion
of
otherwise
qualified
jurors
from
the
judicial
process.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
at
the
time,
obviously,
the
community
as
a
whole
was
not
cognizant
of
the
problem.
the
excluded
jurors
certainly
felt
excluded,
because
there
were
only
10
of
them
to
start
with.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
there
would
have
been
a
perception
that
this
was
not
fair,
for
a
panel
of
all
one
gender,
whether
it
be
female
or
male,
to
try
any
particular
case.
i
think
that
would
have
been
the
perception
in
the
community,
not
necessarily
that
men
would
have
felt
bad,
but
the
community
would
have
felt
that
the
system
was
not
necessarily
fair.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
i
think
men...
i
would
agree
that
men
would
have
felt
excluded
in
this
particular
case.
and
i
think
in
any
particular
case,
if
they
were
excluded
simply
because
they
were
males.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
men
have
not...
i
agree
that
men
have
not
been
excluded
from
jury
service.
but
men
have
become...
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
have
been
a
classification
which
have
received
protection
from
gender-based
discrimination.
so
our
position
is
that
the
same
principle
which
applies
to
gender-based
discrimination
in
general
should
apply
to
males,
and
to
females,
in
this
particular
context.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
i'm
not
saying
that
that
at
some...
for
some
reason
could
not
be.
but
in
this
context,
it
is
certainly
not
an
affirmative
action
because
it
would
also
apply
to
females.
it
is
a...
in
this
case
men
were
excluded.
the
same
invidious
harm
would
have
occurred
if
women
had
been
excluded
from
the
jury
panel.
so
therefore
it
is
not
an
affirmative
action
type
of
process
which
is
allowed
by
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
justice
scalia,
i
would
say
that
it
is
unwarranted
because
that
while
men
and
women
are
not
the
same,
obviously,
and
do
not
have
necessarily
the
same
outlooks,
but
they
do
have
the
same
ability
to
be
unbiased,
to
become
unbiased
jurors
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
justice
scalia,
my
response
is
that,
and
our
position
is
that
simply
because...
a
woman
is
excluded
from
a
jury
because
of
her
gender
should
be
unwarranted
and
unreasonable.
now,
if
it
goes
further
than
that--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--our
position
is
that
the--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--justice
scalia,
i'm
not
saying
there's
nothing
to
that.
however,
the--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--i
think
that
you
can
consider
that.
i
don't
think
that...
our
position
is
that
you
should
not
be
able
to
exclude
a
male
or
a
female
simply
because
of
their
gender.
there
are
studies
that
goes
both
ways,
that
females
are--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
stereotypes
are
stereotypes,
and
they
may,
in
fact,
be
applicable
to
a
certain
percentage
of
a
particular
group,
such
as
60
percent
of
the
women
may
feal
one
way
about
a
subject.
but
there
are
40
percent
that
do
not
feel
the
same
way,
and
if
you
allow
gender-based
peremptory
challenges,
that
40
percent
may
be
excluded
simply
because
of
the
overall
perception
that
women
feel
a
certain
way.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
peremptory
challenges
traditionally
have
been
allowed
and
become
a
part
of
our
judicial
system
because
of
counsel.
trial
counsel
decides
at
the
moment,
during
the
trial,
that
a
certain
juror
may
or
may
not
be
biased
in
this
particular
case,
and
says...
therefore
peremptories
are
allowed.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
the
preconceived
notion,
the
preconceived
stereotyping
that
all
women
feel
a
certain
way
and
so
therefore
they
should
be
excluded
because
all
women
feel
a
certain
way
from
a
jury.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
yes,
sir,
justice
souter,
we
do.
and
that
is
in
its...
probably
its
finest
form,
or
the
simplest
form,
our
argument;
that
stereotyping
for
the
exclusion
of
jurors
should
not
be
allowed.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
in
this
particular
case
i
think
the
court
need
only
go
as
far
as
gender.
however,
i
think
it
would
be
rational
to
apply
the
same
principles
to
heightened
scrutiny
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
would
apply,
then,
to
religion,
national
origin,
and
illegitimacy.
the
examples
you
gave
of
age
and
maybe
other
classifications
which
have
not
risen--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--practically
not.
i
have
never
seen...
in
15
years
of
practice
i've
never
seen
anyone
inquire
of
someone's
legitimacy.
however,
if
that
were--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--no,
ma'am.
i've
never
seen
anybody
inquire
of
national
origin.
however--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--correct.
it
is
clear
from
looking
at
a
person
their
race
and
their
sex,
and
so
therefore
there
is
that
connection,
so
that
it
is
something
that
you
can
readily
observe.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
justice
kennedy,
in
the
race
arena
where
counsel
have
in
the
past
stricken
for
that
cause,
it
has
not
been
allowed.
it
has
been
determined
that
that
is
a
race-based
peremptory
challenge
and
has
not
been
allowed.
i
would
apply
the
same
principle
in
this
instance,
so
that
in
order...
that
use
of
peremptory
challenges
to
obtain
a
better
mix,
i
suppose,
of
a
jury
should
not
be
allowed
in
that
case.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
the...
i
would
agree
that
the...
the
objection
would
be
to
the
individual
challenge
of
the
juror.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
would
be
a
part
of
it,
before
you
would
ever
get
to--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
it
would
be,
yes,
sir.
but
before
you
would
get
to
that
point,
you
would
have
the
opportunity
to
make
the
challenge.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
yes.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
justice
stevens,
as
to
that
panel,
that...
or
as
to
the
group
of
the
jurors
and
the
ability
of
counsel
to
obtain
the
correct
mix,
that
may
be
the
right
answer,
the
way
to
resolve
it.
but
as
to
the
individual
juror
who
is
excluded,
or
to
the
community
as
a
whole,
the
allowance
of
gender-based
peremptories
damages,
as
the
court
found
in--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--justice
stevens,
the
entire
group,
i
would
agree,
would
not
be--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--right.
and
so
it
would
be
the
insulting
of
that
particular
juror,
or
the
exclusion,
which
would
be
objectionable.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
in
part.
i
think
under
batson
and
the
cases
that
followed,
certainly
my
client
would
have
the
standing
to
raise
the
objection
of
the
excluded
jurors.
i
think
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
it
is.
i
think
that's
the
overall,
the
more
broad
argument.
and
the
more
important,
probably,
harm
is
the
harm
to
the
community
and
to
society
and
to
the
excluded
jurors
who
basically
do
not
have
the
opportunity
to
raise
the
objection
themselves.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
national
origin
and--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
because
sexual
preference,
like
age
and
disability,
have
not
been
raised
by
this
court
to
the
heightened
level
of
scrutiny
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
if
the
court
chose
to
at
some
point
in
time,
then
you
could--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--you
certainly
could.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
correct.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
it
is
a
somewhat
invasion
of
their
privacy.
but
trial
counsel
every
day
inquires
of
jurors
on
personal
matters.
it
is
important
in
some
cases
to
make
those
inquiries.
go
back,
as
far
back
as
lewis,
the
u.s.
v.
lewis.
the
court
there
explained
how
important
the
use
of
the
voir
dire
was.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
not
necessarily.
my
point
is
that
you
could
not
strike
him
simply
because
he
was
a
methodist.
if
he
was
a--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--i
understand.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
it
is--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--it
is
the
probably
that
gives
me
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
our
position
would
be
that
if
that
methodist
professed
to
be
a
teetotaler,
and
so
therefore
had
an
individual
conviction
against
the
consumption
of
alcohol,
that
would
be
a
proper
peremptory
strike.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
correct.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
if--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--if
a
postman
had...
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
striking
postmen
as
a
class.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
yes,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
justice
blackmun,
i
believe,
as
a
litigator,
that
the
peremptory
challenge
system
certainly
has
a
place
within
our
jury
selection
process.
it
is...
but
it
must
be
bound
by
certain
constitutional
provisions,
and
we
think
one
of
those
is
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
i
think
it...
it
achieved
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
rendered.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
in
any
situation
the
first
step
the
trial
counsel
is
going
to
have
to
show
is
making
out
a
prima
facie
case
that
the
gender
has
been
used
intentionally
to
strike.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
by
and
large,
there
will
be.
however,
there
are
many
counties
in
alabama,
and
probably
in
other
counties
across
the
nation,
in
which
the
racial
mix
is
50/50,
or
60/40,
very
close.
so
those...
the
batson
still
applies
in
those
cases.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
i
think
the
problem
with
that
approach
would
be
that
the
harm
in
this
case...
in
this
particular
case,
the
harm,
the
men
who
were
eliminated
have
already
been
damaged.
and
therefore
other
men
with
cases--
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
because
the
damage
has
occurred
already
and
it
needs
to
be
remedied.
and
it
will
continue
to
cause
damage
until
it
is
remedied.
mr.
john
f.
porter,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
