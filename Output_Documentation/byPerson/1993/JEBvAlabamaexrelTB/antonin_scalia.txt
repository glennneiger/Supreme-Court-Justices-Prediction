mr.
porter,
you
speak
of
unwarranted
stereotyping.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
take
that
to
mean
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
notion
that
you're...
if
you're
a
defendant
in
a
rape
case,
you're
likely
to
be
worse
off
with
an
all-female
jury
and
you're...
if
you're
a
defendant
in
a
paternity
case,
you're
not
likely
to
be
worse
off
with
an
all-female
jury?
you
don't...
is
that
warranted
stereotyping
or
unwarranted
stereotyping,
or
is
it
simply
not
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
ability...
they
can
both
fight
against
it
to
the
same
degree,
as
every
human
being
has
to,
but
they
begin
from
different
standing
points
on
certain
issues
such
as
those
two,
don't
you
think?
are
you
telling
me
that
a
defense
counsel
is
unreasonable
in
attempting
to
strike
women
in
cases
of
those
type,
in
thinking
that
his
client
would
be
better
off
with
a
male
juror?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
don't
understand.
say
it
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
that
there's
nothing
to
the
fact
that
a
woman
juror
and
a
man
juror,
at
least
in
certain
type
of
cases,
may
have
a
different
outlook
and
hence
be
more
likely
to
tend
towards
the
defense
or
the
prosecution
side?
you...
are
you
saying
there
is
nothing
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
there
is
something
to
it,
but
counsel
shouldn't
be
able
to
take
that
into
account
in
their
peremptories?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
what
peremptory
challenges
are
all
about.
it's
a
playing
of
the
odds.
it's
always
a
playing
of
the
odds.
no
counsel
who
exercises
a
peremptory
challenge
thinks
that
every
woman
or
every
male
man
or
every
person
of
whatever
classification
that
he
eliminates
is
going
to
have
a
certain
view,
but
he's
playing
the
odds.
isn't
that
what
peremptory
challenges
are
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask,
mr.
porter,
what...
is
that
the
total
list
of
categories
that
you
want
this
applied
to?
what
is
it,
now,
sex,
religion,
what
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
national
origin.
justice
antonin
scalia
sexual
preference?
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
no,
not
that.
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
but
we
could
do
that,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you're
the
defendant
in
a
drunken
driving
case,
you
can
strike
jurors
for...
i
guess,
because
you
don't
like
the
color
of
their
hair,
but
you
could
not
strike
a
juror
because
he's
a
methodist
and
therefore
a
teetotaler.
you
would
have
to
accept,
if
it
turned
out
that
way,
a
jury
of
12
methodists
in
a
drunken
driving
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
why
i'm
striking
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
this
fellow
probably
has
very
strong
views
against
drinking,
and
is
more
likely
to
come
down
hard
on
someone
who's
accused
of
drunken
driving
than
some
other
juror.
that's
precisely
why
i
want
to
strike
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
that's
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
all
peremptories
are
based
on
probably.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
a
teetotaler
is
just
a
person
who
doesn't
himself
drink
alcohol.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
necessarily
believe
that
it's
morally
wrong
for
himself
and
others
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
anyway,
you
just
would
not
let
him...
not
let
him
strike
methodists,
right?
but
what
could
he
strike,
people
with
blonde
hair,
postmen?
justice
antonin
scalia
he'll
be
happy
to
hear
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
know
better,
so
you
want
to
protect
defense
counsel
from
himself,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
he
has
his
client's
interest
more
to
heart
than
the
government
does.
and
if
he
thinks
that
what
you
call
unwarranted
stereotypes
are,
indeed,
warranted,
why
not
let
him
take
the
chance?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it's
unwarranted,
it'll
be
its
own
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
thirteenth
amendment
and
a
fourteenth
amendment
that
can
account
for
our
view
of
racially
based
stereotypes.
we're
not
allowed
to
stereotype
for
that.
there's
no
such...
no
such
amendment
changing
historical
practices
with
respect
to
strikes
on
the
basis
of
sex
or
on
the
basis
of
a
lot
of
other
characteristics.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but--
--mr.
dreeben--
--unless
you
extend
it
to
the
other
logical
categories
which
it
ought
to
be
extend
to,
if
it
extends
to...
if
it
extends
to
sex.
i
guess
there's
nothing
to
worry
about
if
you
can
find
a
postman
who
is
neither
male,
female,
has
no
religion,
and
no
ethnic
background.
then
you
would
not
have
to
worry
about
a
challenge;
you
could
go
ahead
and
strike.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brasfield,
i
suppose
that
every
citizen
has
a
right
not
only
not
to
be...
if
we
follow
this
logic,
not
only
not
to
be
stricken
for
that
citizen's
race,
religion,
sex,
and
whatever,
but
also
has
a
right
not
to
be
stricken
for
any
irrational
reason,
i
suppose,
if
that
logic
is
correct?
wouldn't
that
be
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
that
every
erroneous
basis
for
exercising
peremptories
would
be
unconstitutional.
like
if...
in
fact,
postmen
are,
surprisingly,
no
different
from
everybody
else.
striking
a
postman
because
he's
a
postman
would
be
unconstitutional,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
just
striking
a
juror
because
you
don't
like
the
look
in
his
eye.
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
one
could
hardly
afford
to
apply
that
rigorous
a
rule
to
another
category
of
strikes,
or
at
least
another
major
one
as
sizeable
as
sex
discrimination.
