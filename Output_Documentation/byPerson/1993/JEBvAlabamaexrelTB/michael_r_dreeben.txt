mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
nearly
2
decades
the
court
has
held
that
government
action
taken
on
the
basis
of
gender
is
subject
to
heightened
constitutional
scrutiny.
in
light
of
that
heightened
scrutiny,
the
discriminatory
use
of
peremptory
challenges
to
remove
a
juror
on
the
basis
of
gender
violates
the
constitution.
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
this
court's
decision
in
batson
has
made
it
clear
that
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges
for
racially
invidious
purposes
is
unconstitutional.
such
challenges
harm
not
only
the
parties,
but
also
the
excluded
jurors
and
the
community
as
a
whole.
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
gender-based
strikes.
the
individual
juror
removed
on
the
basis
of
gender
is
frequently
the
victim
of
an
outmoded
stereotype.
jury
manuals,
for
example,
have
instructed
litigants
to
remove
women
because
of
a
belief
that
they
are
too
sympathetic
or
are
governed
by
emotion,
and
the
case
law
reflects
that
this
has
happened.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
same
argument
could
be
made--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
the
same
argument
could
be
made
about
racially
based
stereotypes
or
ethnically
based
stereotypes,
or
stereotypes
based
on
a
person's
religion
and
nothing
more.
now,
the
reason--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
this
court
has
determined
that
the
equal
protection
clause
not
only
applies
to
sex-based
classifications,
but
that
they
are
entitled
to
heightened
scrutiny
because
there
has
been
a
history
of
discrimination
and
a
history
that
reflects
the
misuse
of
gender-based
stereotypes
as
a
basis
for
government
action.
and
it's
that
court's
determination
in
the
general
mainstream
of
equal
protection
law
that
we
rely
on
in
urging
the
extension
of
batson
from
race-based
challenges
to
gender-based
challenges.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
what's
left
of
it,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
the
important
class
of
postmen,
and
in
addition
classes
that
are
based
similarly
on
occupation,
and
all
classes
that
really
have
not
been
elevated--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
heightened
review.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
trial
judge
will
have
the
discretion
to
determine
whether
there's
a
prima
facie
case.
the
lower
courts
have
held,
in
the
context
of
batson,
that
simply
an
argument
from
numbers
alone
does
not
necessarily
establish
a
prime
facie
case.
there
may
be
other
factors
that
give
rise--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
might.
and
if
it
does,
the
litigant
who
has
exercised
the
strikes
will
be
called
upon
to
give
a
gender-neutral
explanation
for
the
strikes,
just
as
he
or
she
has
to
give
a
race-neutral
explanation.
and
this
procedure,
though
it
may
have
seemed
cumbersome
at
the
time
that
batson
was
adopted
to
those
who
opposed
the
rule,
has
proved
to
be
perfectly
workable
in
the
federal
system
in
terms
of
race.
and
in
those
jurisdictions--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
may
be
some
cases
that
call
for
difficult
determinations
at
the
margins.
i
don't
think
that,
across
the
board,
it
has
proven
difficult.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted
a
gender-based
batson
rule,
as
have
the
states
of
new
york
and
california
and
massachusetts,
and,
as
well,
six
other
states.
and
those
are
large
state
systems,
as
well
as
the
ninth
circuit,
which
is
a
major
federal
system,
and
it
has
not
proven
to
be
administratively
burdensome
or
difficult
to
implement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
so
long
as
the
litigant
relies
on
a
basis
for
the
challenge
which
is
not
in
a
category
that's
protected
by
heightened
scrutiny,
and
in
which
we
are
particularly
concerned
about
the
invidious
use
of
stereotypes,
in
which
the
jurors
rights
would
be
violated
were
he
subject
to
exclusion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
sure
that
the
actual
accuracy
of
the
fact-finding
process
is
necessarily
affected
one
way
or
the
other,
so
long
as
impartial
jurors
are
actually
seated.
what
is
affected
is
the
community's
perception
and
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
process.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
stereotypes
would
in
any
way
enhance
it.
i
think
that
once
you
have
reduced
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
necessarily.
but
i
do
think
that
the
community
itself
loses
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
process
when
biased
selection
procedures
have
been
used
to
empanel
the
factfinder.
and
i
don't
believe
that
that's
different
depending
on
whether
the
bias
that's
used
in
the
selection
process
is
racial
bias,
ethnic
bias,
or
gender
bias.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
line
should
be
drawn,
justice
kennedy,
where
this
court
has
drawn
it
in
other
equal
protection
contexts
where
stereotyping
was
used
to
justify
laws.
where
the
stereotype
is
one
based
on
gender
such
as
to
invoke
heightened
constitutional
scrutiny
because
of
suspicion
about
historical
misuse,
it's
appropriate
to
ban
that
use
of
stereotyping
from
the
courtroom.
where
there
has
been
much
less
concern
about
the
invidious
use
of
stereotyping
or
grouped-based
assumptions,
such
as
strikes
based
on
occupation,
residence,
age,
or
a
variety
of
other
factors
that
this
court
has
been
quite
deferential
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
certainly
part
of
it,
but
there
is
a
balancing
going
on
here,
and
the
peremptory
challenge
system
has
been
thought
to
serve
other
purposes
in
the
jury
selection
process.
and
the
states
may
have
some
leeway
to
make
determinations
that
group-based
exclusions
are
permissible
where
there
is
no
particular
reason
to
be
suspicious
about
the
nature
of
those
exclusions.
but
in
this
context,
where
gender-based
stereotyping
has
been
subject
to
heightened
review
because
of
suspicion
about
misuse,
where
the
community
is
injured
and
where
the
excluded
juror
also
would
find
it
to
be
insulting
to
be
removed
solely
on
the
basis
of
a
stereotyped
assumption,
then
in
those
situations
the
equal
protection
clause
does
mandate
the
eradication
of
this
form
of
discrimination.
the
ruling
in
this
case,
justice
ginsburg,
should
be
applied
retroactively,
just
as
this
court
applied
the
rulings
in
batson
and
the
successor
batson
cases
retroactively.
there
is
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
determination
made
in
that
line
of
cases
that
the
ruling
should
apply
both
to
the
parties
in
the
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
cases
pending,
that's
precisely
correct,
justice
stevens.
i
was
going
to
add
that
point.
we
do
not
believe,
in
answer
to
justice
rehnquist...
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question,
that
the
court
should
make
an
exception
to
a
gender-based
rule
that
would
permit
strikes
when
a
party
is
attempting
to
even
up
or
balance
the
jury.
first
of
all,
we
think
that
that
rule
would
be
susceptible
to
a
great
deal
of
misuse.
it
would
become
extremely--
thank
you.
