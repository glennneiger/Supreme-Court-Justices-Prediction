mr.
porter,
as
a
litigator,
do
you
believe
in
the
peremptory
challenge
system?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
batson
was
wrong?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
just
the
jurors'
rights?
is
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process,
the
accuracy
of
the
jury's
determination
enhanced
or
retarded
by
your
position,
in
your
view?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
you
think
the
stereotypes
may,
then,
enhance
the
accuracy
of
the
jury?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
they
retard
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
goes
back
to
justice
souter's
question
to
the
previous
counsel
as
to
what
the
real
evil
is
here.
if
stereotypes
have
some
value
for
the
trial
practitioner
in
selecting
the
jury,
then
maybe
we
should
draw
the
line
here
and
allow
those
peremptory
challenges.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
isn't
the
purpose
of
abolishing
the
stereotype
from
the
courtroom
in
order
to
confirm
the
duty
of
the
individual
juror
to
set
aside
his
or
her
own
preconceptions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
asking
that
batson
be
overruled?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
accept...
you
accept
batson?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
alabama
court
of
civil
appeals
and
it
concerns
a
trial
of
the
petitioner
for
paternity
and
child
support,
and
the
state
used
nine
of
its
ten
peremptory
challenges
to
remove
male
jurors.
it
was
claimed
that
the
reasoning
of
a
case
called
batson
against
kentucky
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
peremptory
strikes
based
solely
on
the
race
extends
to
forbid
gender-based
peremptory
challenges
and
that
claim
was
rejected.
the
jury
found
petitioner
to
be
the
father
of
the
child
and
ordered
him
to
pay
a
child
support
and
the
alabama
court
of
civil
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
equal
protection
clause
prohibits
discrimination
in
jury
selection
on
the
basis
of
gender
or
on
the
assumption
that
an
individual
will
be
biased
in
a
particular
case
solely
because
that
person
happens
to
be
a
woman
or
a
man.
