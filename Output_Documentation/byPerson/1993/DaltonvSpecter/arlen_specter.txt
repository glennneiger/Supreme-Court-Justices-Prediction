mr.
arlen
specter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
contention
that
there
is
judicial
review
turns
on
alternative
legal
theories,
first
under
common
law
principles
and
second
under
statutory
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it
is
not
determinative
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
there
be
individual
rights
involved.
the
panama
refining
case,
the
american
airlines
v.
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
and
going
back
to
flying
fish,
has
established
the
solid
principle
that
where
there
is
a
violation
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
where
the
congressional
requirements
are
not
met
by
the
executive,
then
the
action
by
the
executive,
the
base
closing
commission,
is
null
and
void.
the
principle
of
judicial
review
and
the
importance
is
not
one
that
has
to
be
emphasized
in
this
court--
mr.
arlen
specter
--no,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
would
not
be.
there
is
no
showing
that
the
elimination
of
the
philadelphia
base
would
have
any
effect
on
any
other
bases
at
all.
mr.
arlen
specter
justice
stevens,
he
could
have
sent
the
list
back
and
raised
an
issue,
but
it's
a
practical
impossibility
in
10
days
to
take
a
look
at
72
bases.
in
the
1991
and
1993
closures
and
realignments,
310
bases
have
been
involved
and
only
3
cases
have
been
brought.
but
when
you
come
to
the
question
of
remedy,
i
want
to
emphasize
this
point,
that
it
may
be
that
declaratory
relief
would
be
sufficient
if
the
district
court
says
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
act
and
that
the
failure
to
have
a
fair
process--
mr.
arlen
specter
--the
congress
could
not
say
the
philadelphia
base
is
excluded.
and
the
congress
faced
this
issue
directly,
justice
stevens,
as
set
forth
at
page
44
of
our
brief
where
the
congress
passed
a
sense
of
the
congress
resolution
saying
that
their
rejection
of
the
resolution
of
disapproval
did
not
say
anything
about
compliance
with
the
act.
it
is
another
way
of
saying
what
senator
dixon,
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee,
said
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
resolution
of
disapproval,
that
he
could
not
take
up
the
question
of
whether
the
congressional
mandates
were
followed,
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
is
a
particularly
and
peculiarly
judicial
function.
mr.
arlen
specter
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
arlen
specter
it
is
a
particularly,
peculiarly
judicial
function,
and
when
you
say
that
there
may
be
an
interference
with
all
the
other
bases,
that's
a
question
for
the
court
on
a
remedy.
mr.
arlen
specter
justice
scalia,
congress,
as
the
lawmaker,
may
do
that.
mr.
arlen
specter
but
within
the
confines
of
the
base
closure
act,
that
was
not
contemplated.
and
the--
mr.
arlen
specter
--well,
not
the
joint
resolution,
justice
scalia,
which
is
called
for
by
the
act.
the
joint
resolution
which
is
called
for
by
the
act,
the
joint
resolution
of
disapproval,
calls
for
rejecting
the
whole
thing
or
leaving
the
whole
thing
in
place.
but
where
you
have
a
question
as
to
whether
the
congressional
standards
were
followed,
senator
dixon
at
the
hearing
said...
it's
in
the
record...
we
can't
take
this
up;
that's
a
matter
for
the
courts.
and
then
there
was
a
congressional
determination
that
the
rejection
of
the
resolution
of
disapproval
did
not
bear
on
whether
the
provisions
of
the
act
were
complied
with
because
the
congress
could
not
do
that.
it--
mr.
arlen
specter
--chief
justice
rehnquist,
that's
precisely
the
point,
that
the
resolution
of
disapproval
contemplated
under
the
act
said
all
or
nothing.
there
could
be
another
resolution
introduced,
or
a
bill
introduced
to
deal
with
the
philadelphia
navy
yard,
but
that's
a
total
impracticality
because
congress
passed
this
act
saying
that
this
is
the
sole
way
that
you
deal
with
base
closures.
but
when
congress
passed
the
act...
and
this
is
the
fundamental
of
the
case...
there
were
specific
provisions
set
out.
there
had
to
be
a
structure
force
plan.
there
had
to
be
criteria.
there
had
to
be
full
disclosure
to
the
general
accounting
office,
the
arm
of
congress.
mr.
arlen
specter
and
this
was
added
in
the
1990
act
because
there
was
so
much
concern
that
the
defense
department
would
act
in
an
unfair
way.
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
justice
kennedy,
he
did
not,
because
he's
looking
at
the
total
picture.
and
we
offered
to
prove
at
trial--
mr.
arlen
specter
--i
would
have
advised
him
to
send
the
whole
list
back,
but
where
there's
a
defect
as
to
one
base
that's
up
to
the
courts,
because
there
is
a
showing
that
this
is
not
a
garden-variety
matter
of
procedural
error,
as
asserted
by
the
government.
mr.
arlen
specter
i
would
advise
him
that
he
had
very
little
discretion.
he
could
take
it
all
or
he
could
leave
it
all,
but
on
this
record
he
ought
to
submit
the
whole
list
to
the
congress
because
he's
dealing
with
72
bases.
mr.
arlen
specter
that
that's
what
he
should
do.
that
would
be
my
advice
to
him,
because
i
would
say
to
him,
mr.
president,
you
cannot
have
a
determination
as
to
the
failure
of
the
navy
to
supply
the
information
to
the
gao.
you
can't
call
in
two
admirals
who
sent
reports
that
the
yard
should
be
kept
open
which
were
fraudulently
concealed
from
the
gao
and
the
congress,
you
can't
call
in
the
admiral
and
have
him
testify
that
he
was
instructed
by
the
navy,
which
is
an
obstruction
of
justice
not
to
testify
before--
mr.
arlen
specter
--i'm
saying
that
he
acted
within
his
authority.
i
would
disagree,
respectfully,
about
discretion,
because
i
think
he
had
virtually
none,
but
i
am
saying
that
he
is
not
equipped
to
make
that
kind
of
a
determination,
which
is
judicial.
mr.
arlen
specter
justice
o'connor,
he
did
not
have
any
such
obligation,
which
is
the
same
answer
that
general
days
gave
you.
mr.
arlen
specter
correct.
he
could
send
it
back
to
the
commission
once
or
he
could
reject
it
totally,
or
he
could
just
let
it
sit
and
not
act
on
it,
and
there
would
be
no
base
closings.
but
when
he
has
a
72
and
a
total
of
310
in
2
years,
he
cannot
engage
in
the
fact-finding
to
see
if
these
allegations
are
true.
and
for
the
purpose
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
they
are
all
accepted
as
true,
and
we
have
already
had
the
hearing
before
the
district
court.
mr.
arlen
specter
justice
ginsburg,
not
cherry-picking,
but
the
courts
must
always
be
able
to
review
the
congressional
delegation
of
authority
to
see
if
it
is
followed
by
the
executive.
that's
the
fundamental
rule
of
panama
refining.
mr.
arlen
specter
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
to
say
the
courts
could
not
make
individual
selections,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
we
are
not
engaged
in
cherry-picking,
as
general
days
has
said,
by
the
court.
the
court
is
asked
to
send
the
matter
back
to
the
commission.
the
court
does
not
have
the
competency
to
decide
whether
the
base
should
be
kept
open
or
not.
the
court
has
the
unique
competency
to
decide
whether
the
mandates
of
the
statute
have
been
followed
on
full
disclosure
to
the
gao
and
on
a
hearing.
that
is
what
courts
do.
but
it
would
go
back
to
the
base
closing
commission,
and
they
may
win
on
the
merits.
but
that
is
a
very
critical
distinction
here,
justice
ginsburg,
and
may
it
please
the
entire
court,
we
are
not
asking
that
the
yard
be
kept
open.
we
are
asking
that
we
have
a
fair
day
in
court.
we
are
asking,
in
light
of
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
courts
under
marbury
v.
madison
on
judicial
review,
that
the
clear
precedents
of
this
court
be
followed
under
american
airlines--
mr.
arlen
specter
--justice
souter,
it
is
consistent
because
the
base
closing
commission
will
be
sitting
again
in
1995.
mr.
arlen
specter
not
really--
mr.
arlen
specter
--no,
i'm
saying
the
court
has
the
authority
under
decisions
and
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
say
to
the
commission
where
you
flout
the
direction
of
congress
and
make
the
law
a
nullity,
because
congress
said
that
you
have
to
turn
over
the
information
to
the
congressional
arm,
the
comptroller
general,
the
general
accounting
office,
and
where
you
have
to
have
hearings
and
you
don't
do
that,
do
it
right.
and
if
you
do--
mr.
arlen
specter
--justice
souter,
there
is
ample
time
for
the
commission
to
act
in
1995,
because
it
still
is
in
existence.
the
navy
yard
is
not
scheduled
to
be
closed
until
1996.
mr.
arlen
specter
because--
mr.
arlen
specter
--because
the
court
ought
to
act
on
the
most
restricted
basis
possible,
as
the--
mr.
arlen
specter
--not
with
respect
to
judicial
action.
it
is
clear
with
respect
to
presidential
action
or
congressional
action,
but
not
at
all
as
to
judicial
action.
justice
souter,
when
you
postulate
these
concerns
and
these
problems
on
remedy,
i
grant
you
that
there
are
some
concerns
which
we
have
to
address,
and
i
think
we
have...
can
do
it
consistent
with
plaintiff's
position.
but
the
other
side
of
it
is
that
you're
saying
to
the
navy
if
you
let
this
go
through,
you
can
conceal
reports.
congress
says
full
disclosure
goes
to
the
general
accounting
office.
mr.
arlen
specter
the
two
branches
of
congress,
justice
souter,
may
not
make
a
political
pact
in
derogation
of
the
constitution.
this
court
in
franklin
reaffirmed
panama
refining,
which
said
when
congress
tried
to
give
general
legislative
authority
to
the
president
without
appropriate
standards
it
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
arlen
specter
the
congress
and
the
president
may
not
make
a
pact
which
is
unconstitutional.
that's
why
we
have
marbury
v.
madison
and
this
court.
mr.
arlen
specter
justice
kennedy--
mr.
arlen
specter
--well,
i
think
it
is
consistent
for
this
reason.
the
president
has
a
list
with
72
bases
and
he
has
an
allegation
that
there
is
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute
on
one
list,
and
he
knows
there's
a
judicial
system
and
he
knows
that
in
the
conference
report
the
congress
said
that
there
shall
not
be
judicial
review
under
a
number
of
items,
selection
criteria,
force
review.
but
the
congress
did
not
say
no
judicial
review
on
the
issue
of
a
hearing
and
full
disclosure,
and
the
president
knows
that
in
abbot's
laboratories
and
in
bowen
v.
michigan
doctors,
that
this
court--
mr.
arlen
specter
--i'm
saying
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
precludes
judicial
review,
if
it
violates
separation
of
powers,
and
that
is
panama
refining.
mr.
arlen
specter
well,
i'm
on
to
the
second
branch.
i'm
trying
to
cover
my
argument
as
to
the
alternative
theory.
mr.
arlen
specter
justice
ginsburg,
the
question
of
review
of
what
the
commission
did
is
not
one
the
president
can
undertake.
he
cannot
undertake
it
because
he
is
not
qualified
to
do
it,
and
he
only
has
10
days
and
he
has
72
bases.
the
question
of
review
as
to
whether
there
is
compliance
with
the
constitution
is
one
which
this
court
has
acted
on.
and
while
it
is
true
that
the
congress
has
the
responsibility
to
uphold
the
constitution,
and
so
does
the
president,
we
are
not
equipped,
as
senator
dixon
said,
on
the
resolution
of
disapproval
to
take
up
these
questions.
the
president
was
asked
to
review
this
matter
and
he
said
i
can't
get
involved
in
that.
and
we
made
an
offer
to
prove
that.
and
under--
mr.
arlen
specter
--justice
scalia.
mr.
arlen
specter
not
realistically,
justice
scalia,
because
the
consequence
of
that
would
be
to
reject
the
entire
list.
mr.
arlen
specter
you
see,
the
court--
mr.
arlen
specter
--yes.
well,
yes.
mr.
arlen
specter
but
that's
a
price
he's
not
prepared
to
pay.
there
was
an
arrangement
here
for
the
congress
and
the
president
to
distance
themselves
from
this
political
hot
potato,
and
they
arrived
at
an
arrangement
where
to
have
a
fair
process,
a
word
which
was
not
mentioned
by
general
days,
not
mentioned
in
his
brief,
and
it's
the
introductory
purpose
of
the
act,
a
fair
process.
and
how
do
you
get
a
fair
process
with
a
political
hot
potato
like
this
one
where
the
president
doesn't
want
to
have
to
do
something
politically
unpopular
and
the
congress
doesn't
want
to
have
to
do--
mr.
arlen
specter
--justice
scalia,
he
did
not
know
that
when
he
issued
approval.
the
commission
handed
him
a
list
on
june
30th
of
1991
and
he
made
an
approval
on
july
10th--
mr.
arlen
specter
--10
days
later.
mr.
arlen
specter
i
believe
that
the
practical
reality...
and
i
gave
you
a
candid
answer
to
that
question...
is
that
the
president
cannot
reject
72
bases
because
someone
is
saying
to
him
that
the
mandate
hasn't
been
followed
as
to
the
philadelphia
navy
yard.
because
he's
not
equipped
to
do
that.
that's
a
judicial
function.
the
president
is
not
equipped
to
do
that.
mr.
arlen
specter
no,
he
has
to
follow
the
constitution.
but
when
justice
kennedy
asked
me
the
question
about
what
the
president
should
do,
there
is
a
legal
duty
and
there
is
a
realistic
process
which
he
can
follow,
and
he
would
say
the
same
thing
that
senator
dixon
said,
and
that
is
to
leave
it
to
the
courts.
we
have
an
administrative
process
in
our
country.
mr.
arlen
specter
well--
mr.
arlen
specter
--well,
that
is
not
my
position,
that
a
prosecutor
or
a
president
should
prosecute
someone
who
is
innocent,
but
that's
about
what
we
have
here
when
you
have
a
yard
closed
and
you
have
a
congressional
mandate
ignored
and
you
have
fraudulent
concealment
of
evidence,
and
you
have
obstruction
of
justice.
it's
a
lot
like
what
this
court
said
in
franklin
where
there's
a
robbery
of
the
representation
rights
of
the
people
and
you
have
a
process
which
is
not
followed
and
you
have
a
lot
of
theoretical
considerations
as
to
what
the
president
can
or
can't
do,
but
realistically
he
cannot
act
on
allegations,
the
court
can't
act
on
allegations,
the
court
can
only
act
on
proof.
but
if
you
don't
give
us
a
day
in
court,
if
you
don't
permit
us
to
come
in
and
show
these
matters,
the
president
wouldn't
give
us
an
opportunity
to
do
that,
the
congress
wouldn't
hear
it...
i
asked
senator
dixon
specifically,
but
he
reserved
it.
he
said
our
rejection
of
the
resolution
of
disapproval
does
not
foreclose
you
from
the
courts.
we're
not
passing
on
the
procedural
requirements.
mr.
arlen
specter
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you
categorically.
the
decision
in
panama
refining
was
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
statutory
scheme,
not
just
on
the
basis
of
how
it
affected
an
individual.
and
this
court
said,
at
page
432
of
293
u.s.
reports
that
where
there
is
delegation
which
exceeds
congressional
authority,
congress
cannot
give
lawmaking
power
to
the
president.
there
have
to
be
standards
established,
and
if--
mr.
arlen
specter
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
statute...
the
case
invalidates
the
delegation
on
much
broader
grounds.
it
invalidates
the
delegation
on
all
of
the
presidential
authority
to
impact
on
the
transportation
of
petroleum
products,
far
beyond
that
individual
case.
mr.
arlen
specter
justice
scalia,
that
is
one
aspect,
but
it
was
much
broader.
the
actions
was...
the
statute
was
invalidated
on
much
broader
grounds.
mr.
arlen
specter
justice
scalia--
mr.
arlen
specter
--the
right
violated
and
the
standing
to
bring
this
suit
has
not
been
challenged
by
the
government.
and
under
the
standards
which
you
articulated
in
your
opinion
in
franklin,
we
have
met
that
standard
of
showing
that
a
right
has
been
violated.
and
i
would
urge
the
court--
mr.
arlen
specter
--it
rises
to
the
level
of
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers
when
the
executive
branch
disregards
the
standards.
in
panama
there
were
no
standards
set,
and
in
the
american
airlines
case
where
judge
burger,
later
chief
justice,
picked
up
the
issue
about
invalid
authority,
invalid
administrative
authority,
handing
an
order
to
a
president
which
was
invalid;
the
president
had
a
nullity
before
him.
so
that
the
cases
under
the
common
law
decisions...
and
flying
fish
is
another
one...
going
back
to
1804,
a
consistent
line
to
say
that
where
the
authority
is
not
exercised
by
the
executive,
and
in
this
case
the
base
closing
commission
in
conformity
with
the
standards,
which
it
certainly
was
not,
that
there
is
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers.
i've
not
had
an
opportunity
to
deal
to
any
extent
with
the
administrative
procedures
act,
which
was
the
gravamen
of
the
review
here
under
franklin.
and
i
would
urge
this
court
not
to
expand
the
doctrine
of
franklin.
this
case
is
fundamentally
different
from
franklin
because
in
franklin
the
president
had
the
authority
to
revise
the
census
data,
had
supervisory
authority
to
modify
it
and
amended
it,
which
the
president
cannot
do
here.
and
that
was
a
5
to
4
decision.
and
to
permit
administrative
agencies
in
our
society
to
operate
without
judicial
review
on
the
distinction
of
what
is
final
administrative
agency
action,
where
here
the
base
commission
decision
had
a
direct
impact
on
the
parties
involved
and
was
final.
and
i
would
offer
you
a
syllogism,
that
where
the
veto
power
of
the
congress
does
not
defeat
finality
of
administrative
action,
and
the
government
concedes
that
because
the
congress
is
excluded
from
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
the
congressional
veto
does
not
take
us
out
from
under
the
apa,
not
should
the
virtually
identical--
mr.
arlen
specter
--congressional
authority.
