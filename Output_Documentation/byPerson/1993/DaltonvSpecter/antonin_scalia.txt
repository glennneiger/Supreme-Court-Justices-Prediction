justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
commission
subject
to
the
president's
direction
in
any
respect?
could
he
stop
the
commission
from
behaving
improperly
in
developing
its
recommendations
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
days,
you
could
say
that
about
any
arbitrary
or
capricious
executive
action.
you
could
always
say
if
congress
doesn't
like
it,
congress
could
have
enacted
a
joint
resolution
of
disapproval,
which
is
the
same
as
a
piece
of
legislation.
it
has
to
pass
both
houses,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
be
signed
by
the
president.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
is
this
any
different
from
any...
any
other
instance
of
executive
arbitrariness?
congress
can
overturn
it
by
a
law
if
it
doesn't
like
it.
i
don't
find
that
a
very
persuasive...
it
doesn't
make
me
feel
better
about
the
arbitrariness
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there
was
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
doesn't
really
have
to.
he's
supposed
to,
but
you've
told
us
you
can't
imagine
any...
you
know,
any
defect
that
would
be
bad
enough
to
allow
review.
all
you
say
is
he's
supposed
to
do
it.
let's
assume
he
doesn't
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask--
justice
antonin
scalia
--general
days,
i
frankly
don't
see
why
your
case
is
any
stronger
than
a
case
in
which
the
same
scheme
were
set
up
but
it
did
not
say
at
the
end
that
when
the
president
approves
it,
he
sends
it,
transmits
it
to
the
hill,
and
the
hill
has
45
days
to
overturn
it.
suppose
it
didn't
say
that?
suppose
it
just
said
the
president
shall
make
the
decision.
he
has
to
take
it
or
leave
it
when
it's
submitted
to
him,
and
his
decision
shall
not
be
effective
for
45
days...
that's
all
it
says,
shall
not
be
effective
for
45
days.
in
fact,
that's
the
same
result,
right?
congress
can...
could
only
be
able
to
overturn
it
by
joint
resolution.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
do
you
gain
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
scheme
in
which
he
formally
had
to
place
it
before
congress?
i
don't
see
how
that
makes
your
case
for
nonreviewability
any
stronger.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
it's
important
that
the
president
is
involved.
i'm
not
sure
it's
at
all
important
that
congress
is
involved.
that
is
to
say
that
what
the
president
does
is
not
simply
issue
a
regulation,
the
bases
shall
close,
period,
effective
45
days
from
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
difference
between
that
and
this
scheme
where
it
says
not
just
45
days
from
now,
but
within
those
45
days
i'm
leaving
it
on
the
floor
of
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
senator,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
congress
can
do
anything
by
a
joint
resolution.
if
congress
passes
a
joint
resolution,
which
to
be
effective
has
to
be
signed
by
the
president,
it
has
passed
a
new
statute
which
would
supersede
this
whole
statute
anyway.
congress...
i
agree
with
you
that
the
president
couldn't
single
out
the
philadelphia
base,
but
congress
could
by
joint
resolution.
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
contemplated,
but
the
base
closure
act
calls
for
a
joint
resolution
and
congress
can
do
anything
it
wants
by
a
joint
resolution
so
long
as
it's
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
president
doesn't
have
to
use
the
same
criteria
that
the
commission
used.
he
could
disapprove
it
for
any
reason,
couldn't
he?
i
mean
it's
a
brand
new
judgment
when
it
gets
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could
just
say,
i
like
philadelphia
and
i'm
not
going
to
close
the
philadelphia
navy
yard,
no
matter
what.
he
could
say
that
if
he
wants.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
he
could
do
that
if
he
wants,
can't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
realistically,
but
legally,
i
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
don't
read
laws
that
way.
i
mean,
the
fact
is
that
the
president
had
an
independent
judgment,
that
whatever
the
commission
came
up
with
did
not
govern,
and
even
the
criteria
it
used
did
not
govern.
it
was
entirely
the
president's
call
to
approve
this,
and
if
he
didn't
want
to,
to
say
i
don't
like
it.
i
don't
care
how
you
did
it.
maybe
you
did
it
right,
maybe
you
did
it
wrong,
i
don't
like
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
instance
of
someone
who
was
sought
to
be
prosecuted
for
transporting
the
hot
oil,
wasn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--sure,
but
you
still
got
to
find
somebody
who
has
had
a
right
violated.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of...
a
lot
of
violations
of
separation
of
powers,
a
lot
of
things
that
can
be
done
wrong
which
we
judges
have
no
power
to
reach
unless
somebody
has
been
harmed
in
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
see
where
that
is
here.
