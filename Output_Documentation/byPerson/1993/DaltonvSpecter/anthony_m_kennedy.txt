justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
you
conceive
of
any
procedural
irregularity
so
gross
as
to
invalidate
the
commission's
findings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
the
commission
issued
a
report
in
1994,
which
it's
not
authorized
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
president
acted...
transmitted
the
list,
that
would
be
a...
and
the
congress
refused
to
act
to
upset
that
determination,
those
bases
could
be
closed
without
interference
from
the
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
might
have
thought
your
argument
would
have
been
that
if
we
were
to
permit
judicial
review,
that
one
possibility
is
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
throw
out
the
entire
list
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
the
statutory
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
resort
to
a
si
prius
doctrine
and
just
save
the
philadelphia
base.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
can
retreat
just
a
minute
from
that
parade
of
horribles,
let's
again
assume
that
we
find
that
there
is
judicial
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
the
apa
review
applies.
what
should
be
the
rule
if
the
commission
violates
its
statutory
mandate
to
hold
a
public
hearing,
and
we've
made
this
assumption?
can
an
aggrieved
person
immediately
go
to
seek
judicial
review
and
a
judicial
order
to
open
the
hearings
immediately
after
the
commission
makes
its
determination
to
close
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
want
to
observe...
suppose
you
want
to
observe
the
public
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
the
president
concluded
that
some
of
these
conditions
that
you
have
just
described
had
not
been
followed
by
the
commission,
did
he
have
the
duty
to
reject
the
list?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you
were
his
legal
counsel
and
these
defects
had
been
disclosed
to
him
during
the
short
period
of
time
in
which
he
could
either
reject
or
approve
the
list,
you
would
have
said
that
he
had
the
legal
right
to
submit
the
list
to
the
congress,
to
go
ahead
with
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
he...
but
would
you
further
advise
him
that
he
did,
in
his
discretion,
have
the
authority
to
transmit
the
list
to
the
congress?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
what
he
ought
to
do...
that
he
ought
to
submit
the
whole
list
to
the
congress?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you're
saying
he
acted
within
his
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
senator--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but,
senator,
that's
what
confuses
me
about
the
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
you
earlier.
the
president
has
an
obligation
to
obey
the
law
and
the
constitution,
and
yet
you
postulated
that
the
president,
with
full
knowledge
of
a
procedural
irregularity,
could
submit
this
list
to
the
congress.
i
should
have
thought
if
your
case
is
one
in
which
you
are
vindicating
the
rule
of
law,
the
president
had
absolute
obligation
under
the
hypothesis
we
put
to
refuse
to
transmit
a
list
that
was
improperly
composed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
answer
the
way
you
did
consistently
with
your
whole
theory
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
he
can't
knowingly
prosecute
somebody
that
he
believes
is
absolutely
innocent,
can
he?
those
are
for
the
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
surely
that
can't
be
your
position,
senator.
