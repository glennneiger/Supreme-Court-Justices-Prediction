justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
didn't
put
it
this
way,
but
basically
you're
saying
this
is
just
a
pact,
a
kind
of
a
modus
vivendi
between
the
two
political
branches.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--senator
specter
says
they
don't
have
time
to
do
that.
his
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
that's
what
you're
banking
on,
there
won't
be
any
procedural
review
at
all,
because
he
says
congress
basically
cannot
act
in
the
time
that
the
statute
would
allow
it
to
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
they
do...
for
the
activity,
the
actions
of
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches,
they
don't,
for
purposes
of
judicial
review,
do
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
you're
not...
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
you're
not
arguing
that
unless
the
philadelphia
closing
goes
forward
in
this
case,
the
closing
of
every
other
base
on
the
list
is
held
up
too
as
a
result
of
judicial
review?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
your
argument,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
no,
i
understand
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
my
only
point
was
you're
not
arguing
that
if
this
court
sustains
judicial
review
and
if
the...
an
order
is
entered
which
will
terminate
the
closure
proceedings
for
philadelphia,
that
that's
going
to
affect
the
closure
of
every
other
base
that
was
on
the
same
list
with
philadelphia.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
no...
they're
not
subject
to
any
challenge.
i
mean
nobody's
brought
a
suit.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
your
position
with
respect
to
the
significance
of
the
express
provision
for
congressional
disapproval
that
it's
sort
of
affirmative
evidence
that
congress
would
engage
in
a
review,
and
hence
affirmative
evidence,
one
more
bit
of
evidence
for
you
that
that's
where
the
review
was
to
take
place
and
not
somewhere
else?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
senator,
may
i
interrupt
you?
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
saying
is
the
most
the
court
can
do
is
to
declare
that
with
respect
to
this
one
base
there
was
a
procedural
irregularity,
maybe
a
very
serious
one,
then
send
it
back
somehow
into
the
executive
process
and
say
you
figure
out
what
to
do.
and
yet
the
essence
of
the
executive
process
was
that
it
would
proceed
on
a
given
timetable
on
an
all,
take
it
or
leave
it,
basis.
and
i
don't
see
how
that
relief
is
consistent
with
the
scheme
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
with
an
entirely
different
package
in
front
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
effect,
you're
saying
the
court
can
say
add
a
new
item
to
this
year's
package,
change
the
next--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
do
it
right,
but
the
time
for
doing
it
right
is
passed.
and
your
remedy,
in
effect,
as
i
understand
it,
involves
a
court
ordering
the
commission
to
consider
a
different
mix
from
the
mix
that
the
commission
otherwise
would
derive?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
have
time,
but
i
don't
think
that
goes
to
my
question.
but
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question,
which
i
thought
you
might
get
close
to
in
answering
justice
ginsburg's.
assuming
that
the
court
finds
that
with
respect
to
the
philadelphia
shipyard
there
was
a
significant
procedural
irregularity.
we've
got
judicial
review,
that's
the
conclusion...
whatever
relief
the
court
gives,
whether
it
were...
and
you're
not
asking
for
it...
you
tell
me
if
it
were
to
order
the
closure
to...
process
to
be
halted,
or
whether
it's
some
kind
of
a
remand
procedure
which
you've
described,
why
doesn't
the
scheme
of
the
act
require
the
court
to
take
the
package
all
or
nothing,
so
that
if
there's
something
wrong
with
philadelphia,
there's
something
wrong
infecting
the
entire
political
mix
which
it
was
the
object
of
the
statute
to
require
both
congress
and
the
president
to
act
on
as
a
package?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
philadelphia's
tainted,
why
don't
we
say
that
the
relief
is
going
to
affect
all
of
the
others?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
act...
the
court
also
ought
to
act
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress,
and
the
intent
of
congress
to
regard
a
package
as
a
package
is
pretty
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
the
other
side
of
it
is
basically
that
the...
that
this
is
essentially
a
political
pact
between
two
branches
of
the
government
and
the
congress
can
decide
what
to
do
about
it
if
there
is
a
procedural
irregularity.
that's
the
alternative.
