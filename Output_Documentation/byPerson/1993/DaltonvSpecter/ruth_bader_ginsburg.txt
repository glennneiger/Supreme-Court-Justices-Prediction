justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
days,
the
normal
presumption
is
that
legislation
and
its
operation
will
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
there's
no
express
preclusion
in
this
legislation.
can
you
summarize
for
us
your
argument
of
why
the
absence
of
judicial
review
is
implicit
in
this
scheme?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
different
response
than
the
one
that
you
gave
earlier,
that
judicial
review
is
out
of
the
ballpark
because
of
national...
because
national
security
is
involved
because
these
are
military
bases.
the
answer
that
you're
now
giving
to
justice
souter
seems
to
be
that
this
was
a
determination
between
the
two
branches,
that
this
was
a
matter
for
them
to
determine,
perhaps--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
go
for
everything
now?
i
was
just
wondering
about
the
federal
rules
procedure,
that
get
laid
on
the
table
of
congress
and
then
they
become
effective.
that
wouldn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that
everything--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
everything...
that
you
could
no
longer
have
anything,
you
think,
even
the
federal
rules
procedure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
want
to
distract
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
doesn't
that
cut
the
other
way,
general
days,
that
they
noticed
that
nepa
could
slow
things
down,
so
they
made
an
exception
for
it,
but
they
didn't
make
an
across-the-board
exception?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
senator
specter,
may
i...
you've
been
very
clear,
i
think,
on
two
points.
you
said
there
is
to
be
no
cherry-picking
by
the
president
under
this
measure,
and
no
cherry-picking
by
congress,
but
there
is
by
the
courts.
and
my
question
to
you
is
this;
suppose
congress,
concerned
about
this
picking-off
problem,
wanted
to
say
and
the
courts
too
cannot
zero
in
on
the
philadelphia
base,
on
the
rice
base,
on
any
base,
could
that...
could
congress
have
done
that,
would
it
have
been
constitutional,
or
is
your
argument
fundamentally
that
the
courts
must
always
be
able
to
engage
in
the
cherry-picking
business
in
this
kind
of
a
legislative
setup?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let
me
withdraw
the
word
cherry-picking,
because
i
don't
want
to
make
anything
in
the
pejorative
sense.
you
have
been
very
clear
that
it's
an
all
or
nothing
deal
for
the
legislature,
as
it
is
for
the
executive,
but
you
say
it's
never
an
all
or
nothing
deal
for
the
courts,
and
it
is
never
because
this
legislation
didn't
preclude
that,
or
even
if
congress
had
said,
and,
courts,
you
too
have
no
business
looking
at
bases
one
by
one?
suppose
congress
had
said
that,
would
that
have
been
unconstitutional
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
senator
specter,
in
all
the
cases
that
you've
given
as
examples,
those
were
examples
where
the
executive
should
not
have
acted.
that's
the
theory
of
it.
but
you
said
something
that...
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question
that
really
concerned
me,
because
it
was
always
my
understanding
that
the
constitution
is
the
highest
law
for
every
official
in
the
land,
and
congress
has
an
obligation
not
to
approve
anything
that
it
believes
is
inconsistent
with
the
constitution.
the
president
has
an
obligation
not
to
go
forward
with
any
measure
that
the
president
believes
is
unconstitutional.
it
isn't
a
question
that
while
these
officers...
the
constitution
is
in
the
trust
of
the
court
alone,
these
officers
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
because
the
constitution
is
the
court's
concern.
i'm
sure
that
you
really
didn't
mean
to
say
that,
but
that's
what
came
across
to
me
in
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
