justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
days,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
what
your
position
is
as
to
the
role
of
the
president
in
this
scheme?
i
guess
the
president
has
to
either
approve
the
entire
list
or
reject
the
entire
list.
the
president
isn't
authorized
to
pick
and
choose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
does
the
president
have
any
obligation
to
review
the
proceedings
below
for
irregularity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
president
do
that?
could
he
decide
that
there
were
irregularities
in
the
process
and
therefore
he
wouldn't
approve?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
your
view,
not
obligated
to
review
procedurally.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
senator
specter,
he
did...
did
he
have
an
obligation
under
the
statute
to
review
whether
procedures
were
properly
employed
by
the
commission?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
agree
with
that.
and
the
president
did
have
two
options.
he
could
send
it
on
with
his
approval
to
the
congress,
or
he
could
reject
it
and
send
it
back
to
the
commission.
