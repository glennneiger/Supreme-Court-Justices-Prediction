specter.
general
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
might
this
be
different,
general
days,
if
some
sort
of
individual
rights
in
the
traditional
sense
were
involved,
as
they
don't
seem
to
be
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
days,
in
this
statute
where
congress
may,
if
it
disapproves,
pass
a
joint
resolution,
would
that
joint
resolution
of
disapproval
have
to
be
signed
by
the
president?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
true
also,
general
days,
that
the
commission,
in
debating
the
1993
closings,
assumed
that
the
philadelphia
yard
was
going
to
be
closed,
and
in...
perhaps
relied
on
that
in
making
its
decisions
as
to
1993
closings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
days.
senator
specter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
the
procedures
that
congress
would
go
through
for
a
joint
resolution
under
this
act
might
be
quite
different
and
a
good
deal
speedier
than
introducing
a
brand
new
piece
of
legislation
and
having
it
go
through
committee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
senator
specter,
i
think
your
reliance
on
panama
refining
may
be
rather
strained.
in
that
case
the
law...
on
page
4,
that
the
court
says
if
the
citizens
is
to
be
punished
for
the
crime
of
violating
a
legislative
order
or
an
executive
order,
the
due
process
requires
it
shall
appear
that
the
order
is
within
the
authority
of
the
officer.
that's
where
the...
you're
going
after
the
citizen
to
punish
him.
here
you
don't
have
any
question
of
that
sort
of
an
individual
right,
so
i
think
the
claim
that
panama
refining
supports
judicial
review
here
is
very
difficult
to
make
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
on
the
very
same
page
that
the
language
i
just
read
to
you
is.
it's
in
the
context
of
the
government
proceeding
against
an
individual
and
the
individual
says
the
order
you're
charging
me
with
violating
wasn't
authorized.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
senator
specter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
general
days,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
the
case
is
submitted.
