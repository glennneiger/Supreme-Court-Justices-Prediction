mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
november
5th,
1990,
the
president
signed
into
law
the
defense
base
closure
act
at
issue
in
this
litigation.
the
1990
act
was
the
product
of
vigorous
efforts
on
the
part
of
both
the
congress
and
the
president
to
remove
partisan
and
procedural
obstacles
that
historically
had
made
it
nearly
impossible
to
achieve
a
timely
and
orderly
close
of
domestic
military
bases
deemed
unnecessary
to
the
national
security.
the
compromise
arrived
at
by
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
with
respect
to
this
particular
issue
embodied
several
critical
features.
first,
the
president
was
to
be
held
personally
responsible
for
the
decision.
secondly,
there
would
be
extensive
congressional
oversight
and
involvement.
third,
there
would
be
an
independent
commission
established
to
make
recommendations
to
the
president,
and
there
would
be
a
single
indivisible
package
made
available
to
the
president
by
the
commission.
the
entire
process
would
be
one
that
would
be
completed
within
a
6-month
period.
central
to
this
process
was
that
it
would
remove
concern
for
what
was
referred
to
as
cherry-picking.
that
is
a
practice
that
contributed
to
the
criticism
of
the
pre-1990
base
closure
actions
and
impasses
between
the
congress
and
the
president,
where
on
a
base
closing
list
one
particular
base
would
be
picked
out
and
removed
from
that
particular
determination.
between
april
15th
and
july
30th,
1991,
as...
insofar
as
this
lawsuit
is
concerned,
every
party
had
completed
what
was
required
of
that
party
under
the
1990
act.
the
secretary
of
defense
had
made
his
recommendation
for
base
closures
and
realignments,
and
the
commission
had
held
hearings
on
82
closures
or
realignments.
the
president
had
approved
the
entire
list
and
transmitted
it
to
congress,
and
congress,
having
held
hearings
on
that
particular
list,
had
declined
to
enact
a
joint
resolution
of
disapproval.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
that's
central
to
the
scheme.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
he
does
not.
there's
nothing--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
would
prevent
that.
in
fact,
the
president
can
reject
the
list
that's
submitted
by
the
commission
and
send
it
back
to
the
commission
for
further
deliberations
and
a
new
list.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
he
is
not
obligated
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
reflects
that
power
on
the
part
of
the
president.
of
course,
the
president
appoints
the
commission
after
consultation
with
both
sides
of
the
aisle
in
the
congress,
but
there
is
no
direct
supervision
by
the
president
of
the
activities
of
the
commission.
the
congress,
however,
does
have
a
very
active
role
to
play
in
this
process.
there
are
at
least
10
points
in
the
process
where
congress
has
a
role
to
play,
starting
with
the
appointment
of
the
commission
itself,
and
moving
through
the
point
where
congress
has
the
ability
to
enact
a
joint
resolution
of
disapproval.
so
that
one
would
presume
that...
although
it's
not
explicit
in
the
statute,
that
congress
could
make
its
views
known
during
this
entire
process.
and,
indeed,
i
think
the
facts
were
that
congress
did
make
its
views
known
from
time
to
time,
leading
up
to
this
base
closure
decision.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
you're
certainly
right
that
the
presumption
exists
in
favor
of
judicial
review,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
held
that
that
presumption
and
the
use
of
the
term
"clear
and
convincing
evidence"
was
designed
to
impose
an
evidentiary
standard
in
the
sense
that
we
would
be
talking
about
if
we
were
talking
about
parties
and
the
shifting
of
burdens.
but
we
think
that
even
given
that
presumption
of
review,
it
is
weaker
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
military
sensitivities
are
involved.
when
one
is
talking
about,
we
must
remember,
a
decision
by
the
secretary
of
defense
as
to
what
are
the
military
needs
of
the
united
states
over
a
6-year
period,
and
then
trying
to
work
out
a
closure
process
that
is
consistent
with
that
particular
determination,
and
it
is
a
decision
ultimately
by
the
president
acting
in,
among
other
things,
his
capacity
as
commander
in
chief.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
certainly,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
u.s.
reports
reflect
the
fact
that
there
have
been
occasions
where
this
court
has
exercised
jurisdiction,
or
lower
federal
courts
have
exercised
jurisdiction
where
there
was
an
identifiable
right,
either
a
common-law
right
or
a
constitutional
right.
but
i
think
one
searches
in
vain
in
this
case
to
identify
such
a
right.
there
is
not
a
common-law
right.
and,
indeed,
the
third
circuit
rejected
the
notion
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
presented
by
this
case.
there
was
an
assertion
in
the
complaint
of
a
due
process
violation
flowing
out
of
some
of
the
errors
that
the
plaintiffs
identify,
the
respondents
identify,
but
the
third
circuit
rejected
that
particular
claim.
and,
as
i
understand
it,
respondents
now
are
pressing
their
constitutional
claim,
their
due
process
claim,
before
this
court.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
this
was
the
result
of
a
very
long
period
in
which
the
congress
and
the
president,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
found
themselves
unable
to
agree
upon
how
base
closures
should
be
handled.
in
1988
there
was
an
act
that
pointed
in
the
same
direction
as
this
1990
act,
but
it
was
for
1
year.
this
particular
act
incorporated
many
of
those
features
that
the
congress
and
the
president
felt
had
worked
well,
that
had
removed
most
of
the
avenues
for
political
maneuvering
and
obstruction,
procedural
obstruction,
which
had
really
prevented
the
government
from
doing
what
i
think
everyone
recognized
needed
to
be
done,
given
the
enormous
costs
that
are
incurred
when
an
obsolete
base
is
kept
open
year
after
year,
and
also
when
it's
not
needed
for
the
protection
of
the
united
states.
so
we
see
this
very
much
as
an
understanding
between
the
president
and
the
congress
as
to
how
to
do
this
most
effectively,
and
i
mentioned--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
my
responses
are
inconsistent.
i
just
wanted
to
respond
to
your
point
about
the
presumption,
and
i
think
the
presumption
is
weaker
under
these
circumstances.
but
i
think
the
history
and
the
structure
and
purpose
of
the
act
also
suggests
that
judicial
review
was
not
viewed
by
the
congress
or
anticipated
by
the
congress
as
an
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
whatever
problems
might
have
arisen
under
the
act.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
kennedy,
one
pauses
when
posed
a
question
like
yours,
but
i
think
that
given
the
structure
of
the
act
and
given
the
history
and
purpose,
there
would
be
no
violation
that
would
rise
to
the
level
of
judicial
review
or
trigger
judicial
review.
this
is
a
matter--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
would
be
dealt
with
by
the
congress.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
this
is,
after
all,
a
piece
of
legislation
that
has
a
sunset
provision.
it
exists
for
only
5
or
6
years,
and
after
that
point
certainly
congress,
in
due
course,
could
revisit
this
issue.
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
there
are
points
during
the
process
where
congress
can
make
its
interests
and
its
concerns
felt,
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
appropriate
to
presume
that
the
commission
or
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
defense
would
be
completely
unaffected
by
those
expressions
of
concern.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
could
do
so
at
the
point
where
it
can
vote
out,
enact
a
joint
resolution
of
disapproval.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
and
in
this
case--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
as
i
indicated,
congress
has
the
ability
to
review
what's
going
on
in
this
process
at
many
different
points,
and
in
this
case
it
was
possible
for
the
congress
to
hold
hearings,
to
assign
particular
issues
to
committees
and
subcommittees
for
resolution.
and
we're
not
talking
about
something
that
arrives
on
the
doorstep
of
the
congress
completely
unannounced.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
understand
that,
justice
scalia.
but
this
is
a
situation
that
i
think
is
not
commonplace.
it's
not
like
a
normal
statutory
scheme.
it's
one
where
congress,
as
i
indicated,
is
intimately
involved
from
the
beginning
to
the
end.
the
president
has
to
consult
with
members
of
congress
before
even
appointing
members
of
the
commission.
the
secretary
of
defense,
as
part
of
the
budgetary
process,
has
to
submit
the
force
structure
plan,
the
criteria
for
closing.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
scalia,
i
think
this
is
a
risk
that
congress
felt
it
was
prepared
to
take,
given
the
problems
that
the
president
and
congress
had
encountered
in
the
past
in
dealing
with
the
whole
base
closure
issue.
this
particular
problem
of
cherry-picking
was
one
that
had
brought
the
president
and
congress
to
impasse
in
many
instances.
and
also
there
was
this
concern
about
the
extent
to
which
political
considerations
entered
into
the
process;
that
some
people
got
better
treatment
or
some
bases
got
better
treatment
than
others.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
it
would,
it
would
have
to
accord
with
the
presentment
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
it's
our
understanding,
and
it
was
the
contemplation
of
congress,
that
this
would
go
through
the
presentment
process.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
and
the
charter
would
dictate
that.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think
that's
a
different
scheme,
justice
ginsburg,
but
in
this
particular
case
we're
talking
about
an
enactment
by
the
congress,
by
the
entire
congress.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
no,
it's
certainly
an
interesting
question.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
it
has
not.
in
fact,
my
understanding
is
that
the
closing
of
the
philadelphia
shipyard
is
moving
along.
right
now
the
uss
kennedy
is
being
overhauled
at
the
shipyard.
but
in,
i
guess,
july
of
'91
when
this
lawsuit
was
filed,
there
were
7,000
employees
at
the
naval
yard.
there
are
now
about
5,000,
and
the
cease
mission
date
is
august
30th
or
september
30th,
1995.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
there
is
no
stay
in
this
particular
case.
and
this,
of
course,
points
up
a
difficult
problem
with
judicial
review
in
this
case,
because
all
the
bases
either
stand
or
fall
together.
the
1991
closure
list
included
the
naval
shipyard.
the
1993
closure
process
has
been
completed.
the
commission
has
been
disbanded,
and
that
particular
list
was
dependent
upon
the
philadelphia
shipyards
being
closed
and
one
would
presume
that
the
'95
process
would
also
take
that
into
consideration.
it's
not
merely
a
question
of
dropping
or
adding
one
particular
base.
it's
a...
it's
the
case
that
all
of
the
pieces
to
this
puzzle
have
to
fit
together.
and
one...
when
one
moves
a
piece
out--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no.
the
point
i'm
making--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
i'm...
that
is
a
problem
because
if
the
secretary--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
my
argument,
justice
souter,
is
that
when
the
secretary
of
defense
determines
that
certain
bases
need
to
be
closed,
the
commission
makes
the
recommendation
and
the
president
approves.
the
list
stands
or
falls
in
its
entirety.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
not
necessarily,
but
they
are
interrelated.
but
i
think
that
point
is--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no
one's
brought
a
suit,
but
i
think
what
this
lawsuit
reflects
is
one
of
potentially
82
lawsuits.
in
other
words,
with
82
bases
being
either
closed
or
realigned,
given
the
theory
of
the
respondents
and
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there
could
have
been
81
other
lawsuits.
indeed,
in
cohen
v.
rice
there
was
an
effort
in
the
state
of
maine
to
prevent
the
closure
of
a
base
in
that
state.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
precisely
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
that's
what
this
case
is
really
all
about.
they're
trying
to
prevent
the
closure--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--of
one
of
those
pieces
of
the
puzzle
in
the
entire
puzzle,
and
the
question
would
be
the
impact
of
that
particular
determination
in
favor
of
the
respondents
upon
the
entire
list
or,
indeed,
subsequent
list.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
throw
out
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
it
might
require
a
court
to
throw
out
the
'91
list,
the
'93
list,
and
direct
the
'95
commission
that
it
would
have
to
carry
out
its
responsibilities
without
any
dependence
on
the
philadelphia
naval
shipyard
being
included
in
that
closure
process.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
would
think
not,
justice
kennedy.
this
is
a
situation
where
there
is
no
immediate
impact
on
anyone.
it's
moving
toward
the
ultimate
decision.
but
that
would
not
be
any
direct
impact--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
perhaps
there
would
be
a
right
to
go
into
court
to
claim
that
the
agency
was
withholding
a
right
pursuant
to
the
apa
or
pursuant
to
the
statute,
that
individuals
would
be
entitled
to,
but
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
final
agency
action
under
the
apa.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
so
it
would
be
wrongly
withheld
action
under
the
apa
by
the
agency.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
we
think
this
case
is
controlled
by
this
court's
decision
in
franklin
v.
massachusetts,
that
what
we
have
here,
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
president
wasn't
named
as
a
defendant,
is
basically
an
effort
to
get
courts
to
review
presidential
action.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
commission
agencies
make
nonbinding
recommendations
to
the
president
and
then
the
president
has
the
discretion
to
decide
what
he's
going
to
do
under
those
circumstances.
as
the
third
circuit
said,
the
president
can
make
his
decision
for
any
reason
at
all.
this
is
discretion
that
is
not
bound
by
the
terms
of
the
statute.
although
the
argument
has
been
made
by
the
respondents
that
this
is
somehow
different
from
franklin,
we've
never
viewed
franklin
as
a
decision
about
artful
pleading,
but
rather
about
the
respect
for
the
integrity
of
the
presidential
process
or
presidential
action.
and
so
we
think
given
this
court's
decision
in
franklin
v.
massachusetts,
this
case
falls
very
nicely
into
that
particular
framework,
and
therefore
it
is
important
that
the
president
is
involved.
this
is
a
situation
where
he
has
more
discretion
than
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
franklin
in
making
the
decision.
so
if
anything,
this
is
a
stronger
case
for
deference
by
the
judiciary
to
presidential

well,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
the
involvement
of
congress
really
goes
to
the
point
that
i
was
making
earlier,
that
even
if
you
disagree
with
our
argument
and
find
that
there
was
final
action
under
the
apa
and
therefore
reviewability,
the
act
itself
does
not,
we
submit,
contemplate
judicial
review.
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
the
involvement
of
congress,
the
need
for
expedition,
the
fact
that
in
this
legislation
congress
recognized
that
the
nepa
process
was
one
that
had
been
used
for
a
variety
of
reasons
to
delay
the
process,
and
therefore
nepa
was
completely
taken
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
the
nepa
exception
doesn't
go
so
much
to
the
question
of
judicial
review.
in
other
words,
i
don't
see
it
as
an
argument
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
take
nepa
out
but
allow
other
types
of
procedural
challenges
to
be
reviewed
by
the
courts,
but
rather
as
a
determination
that
nepa
imposes
certain
procedural
requirements
on
agencies
that,
apart
from
judicial
review,
can
be
used
to
slow
down,
delay
the
process
that
congress
wanted
to
be
handled
in
an
expeditious
fashion.
and
it
was
really
those
procedural
concerns,
not
so
much
judicial
review,
that
was
on
the
mind
of
congress,
we
would
submit.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
justice
souter,
i
think
that,
in
sum,
this
case
is
really
about
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
to
substitute
judicial
cherry-picking
for
legislative
and
executive
cherry-picking,
which
was
a
major
concern
of
both
congress
and
the
president
when
they
enacted
the
1990
legislation.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court,
senator
specter
refers
to
a
fair
process,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
a
fair
process
that
would
result
in
a
timely
closure
of
bases,
so
it's
the
relationship
between
fairness
and
timeliness.
and
i
think
the
fairness
in
the
act
comes
from
several
sources.
one,
it's
fair
to
congress
because
it
involves
congress
in
an
intimate
way.
the
president
is
on
the
line,
which
means
that
he's
not
a
person
who
can
hide
behind
the
decisions
that
are
made.
there's
an
independent
commission,
as
i
said
earlier.
but
there's
also
a
concern
for
communities.
the
act
itself
has
a
provision
that
deals
with
the
problems
of
transition
once
decisions
are
made
with
respect
to
closing.
getting
back
to
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
authorizes
judicial
review,
we
think
the
fast-track
procedure
indicates
an
absence
of
judicial
review
expectations.
the
45
days
given
to
congress,
the
2
hour
debate,
there
is
an
opportunity
for
any
member
of
the
congress
to
bring
to
a
vote
a
joint
resolution
of
disapproval.
but
we
think
that
what
the
statute
reflects
is
the
decision
to
give
to
the
president
and
the
congress
the
ability
to
weigh
the
seriousness
of
alleged
procedural
violations
against
the
need
to
proceed
with
the
entire
package.
mr.
specter
refers
to
the
sense
of
congress
resolution.
i
won't
get
into
that,
but
we
refer
to
it
on
page
17
of
our
reply
brief.
and
i
think
that
resolution
ultimately
reflects
the
approval
by
the
congress
of
the
recommendations
made
by
the
base
closing
commission
in
this
case.
on
the
question
of
unconstitutionality,
as
i
understand
unconstitutionality
under
these
circumstances,
it
would
have
to
mean
that
congress
could
not
authorize
the
president
to
do
what
the
president
did
in
this
case,
which
was
to
approve
the
package,
even
though
that
was
consistent
with
the
statute.
for
the
foregoing
reasons,
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
thereby
permitting
the
base
closure
process
that
the
president
and
the
congress
agreed
upon
in
the
1990
act
to
go
forward.
we
think
to
do
otherwise
would
disrupt
the
careful
balance
struck
between
the
political
branches.
it
would
intrude
on
congress'
statutory
oversight
role
and
it
would
make
expedition
and
finality
impossible
to
achieve
in
an
area
of
national
security
and
military
policy
uniquely
within
the
competence
of
congress
and
the
president.
thank
you.
