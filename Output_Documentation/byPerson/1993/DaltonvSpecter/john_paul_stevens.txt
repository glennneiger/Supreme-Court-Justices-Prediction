justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
day,
at
what
point
in
the
process
would
you
say
that
congress
would
have
the
best
opportunity
to
express
its
concern
about
procedural
shortcomings
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
the
point
at
which
you'd
expect
them
to
react,
if
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
refresh
my
recollection
on
something?
what
is
the
status
of
the
bases
right
now?
was
the
closing
all
been
held
up
on
all
of
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
stay...
didn't
enter
any
kind
of
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
must
confess,
i'm...
i
must
say
i'm
confused.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
you
had
a
package
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
certainly
the
president
has
to
take
it
as
a
lump
and
the
congress
has
to.
but
you're
saying
in
the
case
of
judicial
review,
if
there
is
judicial
review
it
can
be
done
on
a
base-by-base
basis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
nobody
accepted--
justice
john
paul
stevens
senator
specter,
let
me
just,
if
i
may,
interrupt
you.
when
you
say
null
and
void,
do
you
mean
that
if
there
is
a
concern
about
the
particular...
the
philadelphia
base
and
procedural
shortcomings
as
to
that
one
base,
the
remedy
that
the
court
would
grant
would
be
null
and
void
of
the
entire
package?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
let
me
ask
you,
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
position,
you
do
agree,
do
you
not,
that
if
the
president
were...
found
there
were
procedural
shortcomings
as
to
philadelphia
and
no
other
base,
he
would
not
have
the
authority
to
say
i
will
close
everything
except
the
philadelphia
base?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
point
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position
on,
senator,
is
that
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
the
congress
could
not
say
because
of
the
procedural
violations
involving
philadelphia,
we
will
approve
the
entire
package
except
philadelphia.
they
might
say
we're
very
unhappy
about
that,
but
we
think
the
interest
in
all
the
closures
outweighs
it
and
we're
going
to
approve
the
package.
justice
john
paul
stevens
senator,
if
congress--
--but,
let
me
just
finish...
let
me
just
finish
the
one
thing,
and
that'll
be...
i'll
leave
you
alone.
but
you
do
agree,
then,
that
neither
congress
nor
the
president
could
take
separate
action
on
a
base-by-base
basis,
but
the
courts
could?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but,
senator,
those
were
cases
that
go
to
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
authorized
judicial
review,
and
as
i
understand
your
position,
even
if
the
statute
said,
notwithstanding
procedural
violations,
the
courts
may
not
review
anything,
you're
saying
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
abbot
laboratories
and
those
cases
just
are
questions
of
whether
the
statute
authorized
judicial
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
senator,
as
i
understand
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--response
to
justice
ginsburg,
even
if
he
knew
the
statute
had
not
been
followed
and
therefore,
under
your
theory,
the
constitution
had
been
violated,
he
would
properly
have
said
i've
got
to
approve
this
package.
i
think
that's
what
you've
said
to
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you're
saying
even
he
were
equipped
and
he
had
unimpeachable
evidence
of
what
you
consider
to
be
a
plain
constitutional
violation,
you're
saying,
well,
he
doesn't
have
to
follow
the
constitution,
that's
for
the
courts--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but,
senator,
it
is
true
that
it's
a
statutory
right
that
they
would
say
is
violated.
i
don't
think
they
agree
with
your
submission
that
the
violation
of
statutory
procedures
always
also
violates
the
constitution,
which
i
think
is
part
of
your
submission.
