william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
92-1812,
the
united
states
v.
pedro
alvarez-sanchez.
mister
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
the
ninth
circuit
majority
deal
with
subsection
(a)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
a
fairly
rare
situation,
would
it
not,
that
the
state
police
arrest
someone
when
there's
no
basis
under
state
law
for
arresting
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
gunn.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gunn--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
say
the
government
does
violence
to
subsection
(c)
in
its
interpretation.
you
certainly
have
to
do
some
violence
to
subsection
(a)
to
get
where
you're
going.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
3501
was
intended
to
cover
the
entire
waterfront.
i
think
it
was
dealing,
as
i
suspect
you
would
agree
with
mcnabb-mallory.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
you
have
some
difficulty
with
that
point,
when
you
have
a
statute
that's
addressed
to
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
and
it's
talking
about
admissibility
for
delay
under
various
circuits.
you
have
one
categorical
statement,
and
it
does
seem
to
me
categorical,
notwithstanding
the
fact
you
say
there
would
have
to
be
an
exception,
that
it
shall
be
admissible,
and
you're
saying
that
is
going
to
be
limited
by
what
comes
after.
i'm
not
saying
that's
totally
unreasonable,
but
you're
having
to
take
liberties
with
the
statute
the
same
way
the
government
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
your
construction
require
the
exclusion
of
any
statements
that
would
have
been
admissible
under
the
mcnabb-mallory
doctrine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
that
would
be
rather
clear.
if
a
state
officer
is
arresting
for
something
that
is
both
a
state
and
a
federal
crime,
you'll
assume
he's
arresting
for
the
state
crime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
call
those
line-drawing
problems,
or
they're
evidentiary
problems.
i
don't
know
that
it's
so
difficult
to
draw
the
line.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
policy
virtue
of
that?
presumably
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
deter
federal
officers
from
extended
delay
that
might
lead
to
putatively
coerced
confessions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
go
back
to
i
guess
what
is
called
the
legislative
history
of
5(a),
it
appears
that
it
wasn't
in
the
interest
of
suspects
at
all,
it
was
to
prevent
marshalls
from
piling
up
mileage
by
taking
someone
to
a
distant
magistrate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well.
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
rule
5(a).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
whereabouts
is
the
language
that
we're
talking
about,
about
taking
before
a
federal
officer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
that
in
one
of
the
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
would
your
interpretation
of
the
rule
resolve
the
question
where
the
state
officer
arrests
on
a
state
law
bankrupt...
bank
robbery
charge,
excuse
me,
but
there's
also
a
possible
federal
bankruptcy
charge
that
could
be
brought...
federal
bank
robbery
charge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
he's
arraigned
on
both
of
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
solution
really
doesn't
avoid
the
evidentiary
problems
or
the
line
drawing,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
thought
you
just
said
that
this
was
a
difficult
question
under
your
solution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
may
have
a
statutory
argument
on
your
side,
but
i
certainly
don't
think
that
your
solution
commends
itself
by
reason
of
its
simplicity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
state
officers
detain
someone...
arrest
someone,
detain
him
for
12
hours,
16,
and
decide
there
isn't
enough
evidence
here
to
bring
him
in
on
the
state
charge
because
one
element
of
the
state
crime
we
can't
prove,
but
it's
not
so
with
the
federal
crime,
so
let's
get
the
feds
over
here?
now,
the
would
have...
he
wouldn't
have
been
arraigned.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
rule,
state
custody
there
is
charged
against
the
federal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
would
be
interrogated
as
to
whether
they
envisioned
the
federal
charges
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
ninth
circuit
rely
on
that
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gunn.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
estrada,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-1812,
united
states
versus
alvarez-sanchez
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
