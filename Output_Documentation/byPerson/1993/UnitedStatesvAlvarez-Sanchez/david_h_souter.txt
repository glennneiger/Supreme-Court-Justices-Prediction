mr.
estrada,
i
should
know
the
answer
to
this
question,
but
i
don't.
are
most
state
officials,
or
officials
in
most
states
empowered
to
make
an
arrest
if
they
see
a
federal...
if
they
become
aware
of
a
federal
offense
being
committed
in
their
presence
or
what-not,
even
though
there
is
no
state
offense
implicated
in
the
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
on
your
test,
there
would
still
be
a
state
interest,
i
take
it,
if
they
made
that
kind
of
an
arrest
and
said,
you
know,
we're
just
going
to
hold
him
for
the
feds.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's
a
case
in
which
it
wouldn't
be
a...
i
guess
it
wouldn't
be
the
classic
cat's
paw,
but
the
clock
would
still
start
running
at
the
moment
of
the
arrest.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
you
have
a
legal
mind.
i
mean,
that's
what
legal
minds
do.
