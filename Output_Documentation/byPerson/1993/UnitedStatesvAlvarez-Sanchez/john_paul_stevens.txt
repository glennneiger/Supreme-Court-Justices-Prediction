justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
in
your
reference
to
rule
5(a),
it
refers
to
an
officer
making
an
arrest
under
a
warrant,
and
you
say
that
would
include
a
state
officer,
i
gather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
rule...
in
18
u.s.c.
3501(c),
when
it
refers
to
custody
of
any
law
enforcement
officer,
you
think
that
means
just
federal
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
just
want
to...
perhaps
you
did
cover
this
with
justice
o'connor,
but
you...
really
in
your
cert
petition
you
raised
one
question,
which
was
the
question
about
the
state
custody,
as
i
understand
it,
and
it
is
your
position
if
we
answer
that
question
in
your
favor
we
don't
reach
this
rather
tricky
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
pause
after
your
first
hypothetical.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
your
opponent
said
that
would
be
a
federal
arrest
if
it's
on
a
federal
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
misunderstood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
give
you
a
hypothetical
and
see
what...
what
if
a
state
officer
arrests
a
man
in
possession
of
a
stolen
car,
and
after
he's
in
state
custody
they
plan
to
prosecute
him
for
the
state
offense.
they
find
the
car
has
crossed
the
state
line,
so
they
call
in
a
federal
officer
and
say
you
can
question
him
if
you
want,
and
the
federal
officer
questions
him,
gets
a
confession,
but
in
the
meantime
the
state
decides
to
prosecute
and
they
keep
him
in
jail
for
6
or
8
months,
and
then
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
the
federal
government
decides
it
will
also
prosecute
for
the
federal
offense.
is
the
federal
confession
admissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
plus
the
decision
of
the
federal
government
not
to
make
up
its
mind
about
what
to
do
with
him
until...
they've
no
hurry
on
it
and
no
pressure.
he's
just
going
to
spend
the
next
6
months
in
state
custody
anyway,
so
they
just
don't
have
to
make
a
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
delay
in
bringing
such
a
person
before
a
magistrate
or
other
officer
can
include
delay
in
bringing
him
before
the
state
magistrate,
is
that
it?
in
other
words,
they
were
prompt,
and
did
everything
promptly,
but
just
took
a
long
time
to
get
to
the
federal
system.
i'm
not
quite
clear
on...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
adding
some
words
to
the
statute,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
know
what
delay
means,
is
one
part
of
the
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true,
though,
that
there
may
be
a
fair
number
of
cases
in
which
a
person
is
in
state
custody
and
there
may
be
something
like
counterfeit
money
or
possession
of
a
weapon
or
something
that
might
justify
a
federal
prosecution
but
also
might
not,
in
which
it
would
be
reasonable
to
say,
well,
the
fbi
or
treasury
ought
to
go
over
and
interview
the
fellow,
take
a
statement
from
him,
and
then
decide
what
to
do
without
having
done
the
interview.
under
your
view,
he
must
immediately
charge
him
on
the
federal
offense
and
not
charge
him
at
all,
assuming
he's
not
going
to
repeat
his
statement
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
normally
you'd
catch
someone
like...
i
mean,
i
can
understand
a
routine
procedure
which
would
involve
a
prompt
interview
to
get
out
the
facts,
whatever
the
federal
interest
is,
and
not
necessarily
have
an
overriding
interest
in
immediate
prosecution.
it's
a
tricky
problem.
