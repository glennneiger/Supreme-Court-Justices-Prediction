mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
start,
perhaps,
by
addressing
the
time
limitation
point,
just
because
the
questions
were
just
focused
on
that.
i
think
the
main
problem
with
the
government's
argument,
your
honors,
is
it
basically
does
have
to
insert
that
word
that
it
basically
suggested
inserting
into
subsection
(c).
it
would
have
to
insert
the
word
"otherwise"
in
front
of
"voluntary"
to
make
it
have
any
sense.
worse,
your
honors,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
then
creates
an
impossible
scenario
for
a
court
to
have
to
engage
in.
voluntariness
is
a
case-specific
inquiry.
how
can
you
inquire
into
something,
whether
something
is
otherwise
voluntary?
how
can
you
take
some
circumstance
out,
and
have
a
court
inquire
into
whether
it
would
have
been
voluntary
without
that
circumstance?
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
but
you
have
a
legal
mind,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
focusing
on
the
impact
of
certain
circumstances
on
this
defendant
in
that
case.
whether
in
fact
that
defendant's
will
is
overborne
is
not
probable
cause,
where
it's
what
a
reasonable
person
would
have
thought
based
on
these
facts.
it's
whether
in
fact
this
defendant's
will
was
overborne.
there
is
actually--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--well,
no,
i
think
it
does
do
something,
your
honor.
there's
three
aspects
of
the
plain
language
that
i
think
fairly
clearly,
as
clearly
as
you
can
get
anything
out
of
this
statute,
established
that
it
retains
a
limited
mcnabb-mallory
type
rule.
one,
they
refer...
they
use
the
word...
they
talk
about
inadmissibility,
not
involuntariness.
second,
they
use
the
word,
solely
because
of
delay.
they
don't
talk
about
because
of
delay
that
makes
a
confession
involuntary.
third,
your
honor
and
this,
i
think,
makes
the
statue
more
than
just
a
negative
pregnant...
more
than
just
a
negative
implication
statue.
the
"provided"
paragraph
refers
to
the
time
limitation
contained
in
this
subsection.
they
are
saying
this
is
an
affirmative
limitation
on
something,
and
what
they're
saying,
in
essence,
is
that
this
is
a
time
limitation
on
the
period
of
interrogation,
which
is
exactly...
i
know
the
court
doesn't
want
to
look
as
carefully
at
the
legislative
history
as
justice
stevens
might,
but
that's
exactly
the
way
senator
scott
and
senator
mclelland
characterized
it
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
i
also
want
to--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
you
have
to
read
an
excep...
you
have
to
read
subsection
(c)
as
a
specific
statute
that
controls
over
and
creates
an
exception
to
the
general
in
subsection
(a).
but
your
honor,
i'd
ask
the
court
to
consider,
i
think
the
government
has
to
concede
there's
at
least
some
exceptions
to
the
literal
language
in
subsection
(a)
anyway.
consider
the
rules
of
evidence.
certainly
the
government
i
assume
would
concede
that
the
confession,
to
be
admissible,
has
to
be
relevant.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
correct,
but
by
its
literal
language,
your
honor,
especially
given
the
broad
definition
of
confession
in
subsection
(e),
it
does
cover
the
waterfront
any
time
there's
a
confession,
and
my
point
is
that
you
have
to
concede
that
its
literal
language
is
limited
by
the
rules
of
evidence,
for
example.
then
it
makes
even
more
sense
to
concede
that
it's
limited
by
the
language
of
a
subsection
in
the
very
same
section.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
we're
having
to
treat
subsection
(c)
as
a
more
specific
statute
that
creates
a
limitation
to
the
general
in
subsection
(a).
i
think
it
frankly
makes
more
sense,
your
honor,
to
find
a
limitation
within
the
very
same
statute,
than
it
does
to
have
to
reach
outside
to
other
rules
of
evidence
and
so
on,
so...
but
you're
right,
your
honor,
there
is
definitely
a
tension,
albeit
perhaps
even
an
inconsistency,
between
subsection
(a)
and
subsection
(c),
but
under
our
interpretation,
subsection
(a)
still
has
an
impact
and
still
has
some
meaning.
under
the
government's
interpretation,
unless
you
insert
a
totally
new
word,
(c),
the
phrase
"if
the
confession
was
given
within
6
hours
of
arraignment.
"
becomes
totally
superfluous.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
not
as
to
the
issue
of
delay
versus
voluntariness,
your
honor.
as
to
the
issue
of
state
custody,
our
position
is
no,
but
it
depends
on
how
you
read
the
pre-3501
case
law
in
this
working
arrangement
type
rule,
and
perhaps
i
can
step
to
address
that
issue,
because
i
would
agree
with
the
government
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
the
issue
of
the
effective
delay,
if
in
fact
the
court
rules
against
us
on
the
state
custody
being
included
issue.
i
wanted
to
begin
by
addressing
an
issue
that
i
wasn't
able
to
address
in
my
brief
because
i
didn't
read
it
in
the
government's
opening
brief,
and
it's
a
concession
they
make
in
their
reply
brief
that
i
think
is
very
important.
they
concede
in
their
reply
brief
that
some
arrests
by
state
officers
are
included,
and
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
two
things
about
that
concession.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
on
page
2
of
the
reply
brief.
it
actually
begins
on
page
1.
it's
a
paragraph...
the
second
paragraph
in
their
reply
brief.
the
second
sentence,
they
indicate,
"we
have
never
claimed,
however,
that
arrests
by
state
officers
cannot
be
arrests
under
section
3501(c).
"
"they
then
go
on
to
say,
the
test
is
whether
it
is.
"
for
a
violation
of
federal
law,
"and
they
then
go
on
to
use
the
example
of
the
officer
who
initially
stops
for
a
traffic
offense
and
then
finds
a
federal
warrant
and
arrests
on
that.
"
your
honor,
i
think
that
concession
raises
two
very
significant
problems
with
the
government's
position
and
interpretation
of
this
statute:
1)
it's
very
problematic
to
create
that
subjective
state
of
mind
type
of
test,
and
in
fact
somewhat
inconsistent
with
this
court's
approach
to
fourth
amendment
law,
though
here
we're
not
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment.
second,
your
honor,
it
poses
all
sorts
of
line-drawing
problems,
some
of
which
might
even
start
getting
the
government
close
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
what
if
the
officer
is
arresting
for
both
the
state
charge
and
the
federal
charge?
what
if
the
officer
is
arresting
for
a
single
offense
on
the
facts
that
could
be
charged
under
state
law
or
federal
law?
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
well,
what
i
heard
him
say,
your
honor,
and
i
may
have
heard
him
wrong,
i
heard
him
say
if
it
was
on
both
a
state
offense
and
a
federal
offense
that
then
it
would
be
state's.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
but
that's
not
crystal
clear
to
me
that
that's
the
way
it
should
be.
what
if
it's
for
what
we
call
a
dual
prosecution
offense?
a
common
example
would
be
bank
robbery.
it
could
be
charged
either
as
bank
robbery
under
18
u.s.c.
section
2113(a),
or
robbery
under
california
penal
code
section
211.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
what
if
the
standard
practice
in
that
district
and
his
plan
is
to
let
the
fbi
take
the
man
to
federal
court,
and
the
first
thing
he's
going
to
do
when
he
gets
to
the
police
station
is
call
the
fbi?
i
mean--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--well,
i
mean,
then,
the
example
i...
he
takes
him
to
the
police
station.
does
it
depend
on
whether
he
writes
penal
code
211
on
the
booking
sheet,
or
2113(a)?
i...
it
strikes
me
that
some
problems
are
going
to
arise
in
determining
that,
your
honor.
now,
if
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
required
that
result,
you'd
be
stuck,
and
you'd
have
to
interpret
it
as
the
plain
language,
but
the
plain
language
doesn't
require
that
result,
your
honor.
the
plain
language
refers
to
"arrest
or
other
detention
in
the
custody
of
any
law
enforcement
officer.
"
not
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer,
not
custody
for
a
federal
offense,
not
arrest
for
a
federal
offense--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
in
its
reply
brief,
the
government
focuses
on
that
word
"delay",
your
honor.
the
definition...
i
looked
up
the
definition
of
"delay"
in
webster's.
"delay",
at
least
one
of
the
definitions
is
"cause
to
occur
more
slowly".
i
would
submit
that
when
a
federal...
a
state
officer,
as
in
this
case,
arrests
someone,
plans
to
call
the
secret
service
to
see
if
they
want
to
prosecute
the
person,
and
then
waits
48
hours
to
call
the
secret
service,
those
48
hours
he
waited
caused
the
federal
arraignment
to
take
place
48
hours
more
slowly,
because
he--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--well,
your
honor,
then
the
question
that
arises...
i
think
that's
a
difficult
question.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
well,
one
way
it
poses
a
difficult
policy
problem,
but
i
don't
think
the
statute
necessarily
demands
that,
your
honor.
it
depends
on
how
you
construe
the
word
"delay".
the
statute
is
focused
on
delay
that's
caused
by
law
enforcement
officers,
not
delay
that's
caused
by
the
court
system
or
state
court
procedures,
and
you
could
not
apply
it
in
the
situation
where
there's
a
state
arraignment,
because
the
delay
there
would
at
least
generally
be
caused
by
the
state
court's
need
to
have
the
person
first
and
process
him.
so
it
wouldn't
be
delay
that
was
caused
by
the
officers,
and
i
think
you
can
construe
this
statute
in
context
to
refer
to
delay
caused
by
law
enforcement
officers,
not
delay
caused
by
the
courts.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that's
not
the
sole
purpose
of
the
law.
i
think
it's
a
little
broader
than
that.
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
deter
also
state
officers
who
are
acting
on
behalf
of
or
helping
federal
officers
either
with
a
federal
officer's
request
or
without
their
request.
if
we
think
about
the
purposes
of
this
statute,
and
of
course
to
some
extent
it
goes
back
to
the
purposes
of
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
and
the
purposes
some
of
the
congressmen
talked
about
in
the
legislative
history.
it
seems
to
me
the
purpose
is
of
two
basic
types.
one
purpose
is
to
have
a
bright
line
rule
that
says,
we're
not
going
to
allow
confessions
after
this
time.
then
you
don't
have
to
inquire
when
a
defendant
says
one
thing
happened
during
the
48
hours
and
the
police
say
another
thing.
you
don't
have
to
inquire
about
how
this
particular
defendant
was
affected
by
the
delay.
another
purpose,
your
honor...
another
set
of
purposes
that
applies
as
much,
frankly,
to
innocent
suspects
as
guilty
suspects,
maybe
even
more,
is
all
the
interests
and
principles
our
society
has
in
getting
people
to
court
promptly.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
the
legislative
history
of
3501
i
don't
think
shows
3501
was
for.
the
government
quotes
a
law
review
article
in
a
footnote
in
its
brief
that
says
that
looked
like
the
purpose
of
the
original
arraignment
rules
that
were
construed
in
mcnabb,
but
in
3501,
your
honor,
what
you
have
is
you
have
some
congressman--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--i'm
really
focusing
more
on
18
u.s.c.
3501,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
your
honor,
in
3501(c)
the
language
i've
been
focusing
on
begins
on
the
fifth
line,
or
the
end
of
the
fourth
line.
it
talks
about
"arrest
or
other
detention
in
the
custody
of
any
law
enforcement
officer
or
law
enforcement
agency
shall
not
be
inadmissible
solely--
"
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
page
3
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
that
is
the
statute.
i
apologize.
it
talks
about
arrest
or
other
detention
in
the
custody
of
any
law
enforcement
officer
or
agency,
and
then
it
talks
about
because
of
delay
in
bringing
such
person
before
a
magistrate.
i
think
the
words
we
need
to
focus
on
are
"any
law
enforcement
officer",
and
"delay
in
bringing".
what
i'm
suggesting
is--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--you're
right.
i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--it's
the
phrase
"arrest
or
other
detention
in
the
custody
of
any
law
enforcement
officer
or
agency.
"
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor.
but
those
purposes,
the
purposes...
the
purposes
underlying
this
statute
of
getting
people
to
court
quickly
and
the
purposes
that
were
spoken
about
by
the
congressmen
during
the
debate,
you
don't
have
any
contact
with
family
or
friends
while
you're
detained
incommunicado
before
going
to
court.
you
don't
have
a
chance
to
get
bail.
you
don't
have
a
chance
to
have
a
magistrate
consider
whether
there's
probable
cause.
you
don't
have
counsel
to
start
checking
into
the
case
for
you.
all
those
purposes,
all
those
goals
are
advanced
just
as
much
by
a
statute
that
encourages
state
officers
who
are
helping
federal
officers
to
contact
the
federal
officers
quickly,
so
i
think
in
terms
of
the
purposes
and
policies
underlying
this
statute,
your
honor,
that
those
are
advanced
by
focusing
on
state
officers
as
well
as
federal
officers,
and
the
much
more
workable
rule,
the
much
better
in
context
reading,
i
would
submit,
is
to
focus
on
the
type
of
arraignments,
or
the
type
of
charge.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
i
think,
your
honor,
in
that
case
it
would
depend
on
whether
he's
arraigned
on
the
bank...
federal
bank
robbery
charge,
or
whether
he's
arraigned
on
the
state
robbery
charge.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
well,
then,
your
honor,
i
think
you
get
a
difficult
question,
and
it
depends
on
how
you
construe
the
word
"delay".
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
i
think
it
does,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--it's
a
difficult
question
of
interpreting
the
statute,
not
a
difficult
question
on
the
facts.
the
question
then
becomes
one
for
this
court,
and
frankly
you
don't
need
to
reach
it
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
there
was
no
state
arraignment,
and
the
state
officers
gave
priority
to
the
federal
interest,
but
if
you
did
want
to
reach
it
to
have
a
complete
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it
would
turn
on
whether
you
interpret
the
word
"delay"
in
this
statute
as
including
delay
caused
only
by
law
enforcement
officers,
or
whether
you
also
include
delay
caused
by
state
court
procedures
in
the
state
court
system.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
well,
your
honor,
there's
three
possible
situations
that
would
arise
factually.
one
would
be
where
there's
only
a
state
arraignment,
one
would
be
where
there's
only
a
federal
arraignment,
and
one
would
be
where
there's
both.
under
my
approach,
if
there's
only
a
federal
arraignment
the
statute
applies
from
the
time
of
state
arrest.
if
there's
only
a
state
arraignment,
the
statute
does
not
apply.
if
there's
both,
then
this
court...
it's
not
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
this
court
would
have
to
decide
how
it
interprets
delay.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
correct.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
you
might
have...
you
might
have
a
situation
arise
on
rare
occasions
where
the
state
officers
could
establish
that
they
never
even
envisioned
the
possibility
of
federal
charges
until
some
place
down
the
road,
and
then
that--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--maybe,
but
i
think
that
would
arise
in
only
very
rare
occasions,
your
honor.
i
mean,
most
of
the
time,
as
in
this
case,
the
officers
who
arrested
mr.
alvarez
knew
about
the
state
crime,
they
knew
about
the
federal
crime
at
the
same
time,
the
detective
in
charge
of
the
investigation
in
this
case...
and
frankly,
it
depends,
i
suppose
on
how
you
construe
"working
arrangement",
but
frankly,
i
would
say
under
any
construction
of
working
arrangements
that's
reasonable
under
this
statute,
it
should
apply
here,
maybe
even
under
the
government's
concession.
the
officers
here
arrest,
they
know
about
a
state
offense,
they
know
about
a
federal
offense.
they
plan
on
calling
the
secret
service.
that's
their
department
policy.
they
call
the
secret
service.
they
let
the
secret
service
come.
they
are
acting
only
as
secondary
law
enforcement
authorities,
because
they're
going
to
let
the
secret
service
take
mr.
alvarez
if
the
secret
service
wants
to.
the
secret
service
wants
to.
the
secret
service
takes
him.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
the
record...
their...
the
only
record...
well--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--that's
what
the
detective
says
in
his
declaration.
that's
what
the
district
court
said
in
its
initial
facts.
the
issue
wasn't
really
litigated
in
the
district
court
below
in
this
case
because
under
the
controlling
ninth
circuit
law,
it
didn't
matter,
so
i
don't...
you
certainly
don't
have
a
factual
finding
on
any
issue
that
there
was
any
reason
to
contest.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
there's
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
i
don't
believe
there
was
ever
one
put
into
the
record
below.
but
your
honor,
then
you
get
into
a
really
difficult
line-drawing
situation
that
arises
if
the
government...
does
whether
or
not
he's
arrested
for
a
federal
offense
depend
on
whether
they
write
that
charge
on
a
booking
sheet
as
opposed
to
what
they
did
here,
where
they
decided
to
give--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--well,
he
may
be--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--correct,
but
he
may
be
holding
a
suspect,
your
honor,
only
because
that's
their
way
of
being
able
to
hold
him
until
the
secret
service
can
come
and
decide
if
they
want
to
take
him,
which
was
in
fact
what
the
detective
in
charge
said
his
plan
and
intent
was
in
this
case.
one
thing
i
did
want
to
make
the
point
to
this
court
about
is,
if
this
court
decides
that
there
is
just
a
working
arrangement...
if
this
court
decides
there
is
a
working
arrangement
requirement
which
was
not
a
requirement
under
the
ninth
circuit
case
law
on
which
this
case
was
litigated
in
the
district
court,
i
would
submit
the
matter
has
to
at
least
be
remanded
for
us
to
inquire
into
what
this
detective
was
thinking,
and
what
his
intent
was.
you
do
have
him
saying
basically
in
his
declaration
that
he
was
not
going
to
pursue
the
state
charges
unless
the
federal
authorities
weren't
interested,
and
i
would
submit
that
that
at
least
should
fit
within
the
context
of
this
statute,
even
if
you're
going
to
read
the
words,
"any
law
enforcement
officer
and
delay.
"
in
context.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
difficult
question
that
i
was
suggesting
to
justice
rehnquist
this
court
could
resolve
but
doesn't
have
to
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
there's
two
ways
to
approach
that
question,
and
i
think
we
prevail
under
either
way
of
approaching
it,
your
honor,
and
it
depends
on
how
you
construe
the
word
"delay"
in
the
statute.
a
reasonable
construction
would
be
to
construe
it
only
as
delay
caused
by
law
enforcement
officers,
and
i
think
in
the
hypothetical
your
honor
just
suggested,
the
delay
would
really
be
a
result
of
the
state
court
system
and
state
authorities
wanting
to
and
having
an
interest
in
prosecuting
the
defendant.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
correct,
but
at
least
in
part
the
delay
is
from
the
state
court
system--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--and
state
prosecutors
deciding
to
pursue
the
charges
and
needing
to
have
the
defendant
there
for
the
trial,
et
cetera,
and
once
he's
been
arraigned
in
state
court,
then
he's
no
longer
in
a
state
of
nonarraigned
custody,
so
to
speak,
which--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--all
right,
your
honor.
i
think
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the...
in
your
hypothetical,
i
would
submit
that
at
least
one
appropriate
reading
of
the
statute...
i
mean,
one
could
also
argue
that
delay
means
delay,
and
it
doesn't
matter,
and
it
applies.
you
don't
need
to
decide
that
here.
but
the
other
approach,
if
you're
worried
about
the
policy
implications
of
that,
is
to
construe...
i
think
the
delay
in
that
case
could
properly
be
considered
to
be,
or
attributed
as
delay
due
to
the
state
courts
and
state
prosecution
situation,
and
then
the
delay
would
not
be
delay
attributable
to
law
enforcement
officers,
and
i
think
you
can
read
this
statute
in
context
to
focus
on
delay
attributable
to
law
enforcement
officers,
and
that's
certainly
the
overriding
purpose,
is
delay
that
they
caused,
not
delay
that
the
courts
caused
by
their
legitimate
procedures
of
having
a
trial
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
to
take
this--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--to...
i
mean,
the
easiest
way,
the
plain
language
approach,
your
honor,
would
be
to
say,
that's
delay,
and
the
statute
prohibits...
remember
the
costs
here
are
not
that
great.
all
you're
saying
are,
the
officers,
if
they
don't
get
to
him
within
6
hours,
have
to
arraign
him
first.
they
can
still
interview
him
afterwards.
now,
the
government
may
come
back
and
respond
and
say,
well,
his
attorney
won't
let
him
talk,
but
if
his
attorney
won't
let
him
talk,
then
that's
something
our
society
as
a
general
rule
respects.
so
the
cost
of
this
statute
applies.
there's
some
great
benefits
in
terms
of
the
interest
in
prompt
arraignment
that
i've
described,
and
in
terms
of
having
a
bright
line
rule.
there's...
the
costs
are
relatively
minimal.
the
costs
are
simply,
you
have
to
arraign
someone
before
you
interview
them.
frankly,
your
honor,
there's
also
a
concern,
if
you
draw
this
line
between
state
and
federal
custody,
or
custody
for
a
federal
offense,
whatever
that
means,
you
create
an
amazing
way
of
officers
evading
this
statute,
even
when
there's
not
a
socalled
working
arrangement.
for
example,
the
state
officers
in
this
case
had
a
standard
policy
of
contacting
federal
officials
when
counterfeit
money
is
found,
but
that's
not
a
working
arrangement,
under
the
government's
version.
i
went
back
and
read
the
transcript,
your
honor,
of
the
testimony
of
the
secret
service
agent
in
this
case.
i
believe
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
26.
i've
got
that
page
wrong,
your
honor.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
no,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
just
relied
on
longstanding
ninth
circuit
case
law
that
said
state
custody
is
included,
and
i've
looked
back
in
the
history
of
the
statute
for
that,
and
i
haven't
found
any
case
that
really
analyzes
the
issue
extremely
carefully.
similarly,
the
cases
the
government
cites
really
don't
analyze
the
issue
very
carefully,
either.
but
what
the
secret
service
agent,
your
honor,
did
testify
to
in
this
case
that
i
wanted
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention,
and
it
raises
another
problem
of
evasion,
is,
he
said,
26.
he
testified
that
when
a
person
is
taken
into
custody
by
an
outside
agency,
meaning
not
the
secret
service,
that
an
agent
is
sent
to
the
particular
agency
where
they
meet
with
investigators
and
discuss
the
case
with
them,
and
then
he
testified,
"in
this
case,
as
in
all
cases,
i
then
interviewed
the
suspect
in
this
case.
"
it
sounds
to
me
what
this
agent
is
saying
is,
he's
developed
a
policy
that
always
evades
3501(c).
he
does
the
interview
before
he
takes
the
person
into
custody.
suppose
he
had
gotten
a
call
from
the
law
enforcement
officer,
the
state
officer
who
said,
we've
got
to
arraign
this
man
by
tuesday,
and
we've
got
him
in
custody
for
counterfeiting,
and
he
said,
and
he
thought
to
himself,
well,
he
might
be
more
likely
to
talk
to
me
if
he's
sat
in
jail
24
hours
longer.
i'll
go
over
tuesday
morning.
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
3501(c)
doesn't
apply,
and
you
create...
by
construing
the
statute
to
eliminate
state
custody,
you
create
a
situation
where
that
sort
of
thing
can
happen,
and
i
think
that's
more
damaging
and
more
something
the
drafters
of
this
statute
wanted
to
avoid,
than
just
someone
having
to
go
to
court
in
some
cases
and
arraign
a
person
more
promptly
and
interview
them
afterwards.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
and
assuming
you...
yes,
assuming
you'd
want
to
interview
him
before
arraignment.
the
other
option,
though,
is
to
wait
for
the
state
proceedings
to
take
their
course,
to
wait
for--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--it
is,
your
honor,
but
the
statute...
what
it
does
is,
it
gives
the
state
officers
an
incentive
to
avoid
that
situation
by
calling
the
federal
officers
promptly.
you
have
the
same
situation
arise,
your
honor,
if,
for
example,
the
drug
enforcement
administration
arrested
on
drug
charges
and
found
counterfeit
money,
and
they
don't
deal
with
counterfeit
money,
so
they
call
the
secret
service.
the
secret
service
might
end
up
being...
losing
the
opportunity
to
interrogate
if
the
dea
was
negligent
or
lax
in
contacting
them
promptly,
but
that's
an
arrest
by
a
federal
agency,
and
i
would
think
3501(c)
even
under
the
government's
interpretation
would
apply
there,
so
you're
always
going
to
have
that
situation
where
you
want
a
statute
that
encourages
the
initial
arresting
officers,
if
they're
going
to
pass
the
investigation
on
to
someone
else,
to
call
those
people
that
they're
going
to
pass
it
on
to
promptly.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
the
primary--
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
it's
a
code
directed
i
think,
your
honor,
to
the
federal
courts,
and
the
way
federal
courts
are
to
use
evidence
in
their
courts.
i
think
it's
arrested
to...
it's
directed
to
federal
officers,
and,
i
would
submit,
at
the
very
least
state
officers
who
are
acting
on
behalf
of
federal
officers
even
when
the
federal
officers
haven't
specifically
requested
that,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
carlton
f.
gunn
thank
you,
your
honor.
