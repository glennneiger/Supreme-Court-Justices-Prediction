mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
was
taken
into
custody
on
narcotics
charges
by
california
sheriffs
on
a
friday
afternoon
in
august
1988
during
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant
at
his
home.
because
counterfeit
currency
was
found
during
that
friday
search,
the
state
authorities
contacted
the
united
states
secret
service
on
monday
morning.
respondent
was
questioned
by
secret
service
agents
late
on
monday
morning,
and
he
admitted
to
knowingly
possessing
the
counterfeit
currency.
the
secret
service
agents
then
took
him
into
custody
on
a
federal
counterfeiting
charge.
after
writing
a
complaint
and
booking
respondent
on
that
charge,
the
agents
were
informed
by
the
clerk
of
the
federal
court
that
there
was
no
more
room
on
the
presentment
calendar
for
the
magistrate
that
day,
and
were
instructed
to
bring
respondent
back
before
the
magistrate
on
tuesday.
that
is
what
they
did.
the
district--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
they
were
doing
this
any
later
than...
any
other
way
that
they
would
otherwise
have
done,
justice
kennedy,
and
there
is
no
indication
at
all
that
anyone
waited
over
the
weekend
for
any
other
reason
than
the
fact
that
it
was
the
weekend.
the
district
court
found
respondent's
confession
voluntary
and
admitted
it
at
his
trial.
respondent
was
convicted,
but
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
the
confession
should
have
been
suppressed
under
18
u.s.c.
section
3501.
section
3501
has
three
subsections
that
are
relevant
to
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
of
the
case.
subsection
(a)
provides
that
if
the
trial
judge
finds
that
if
a
confession
was
voluntarily
made,
she
must
admit
it
in
evidence,
subsection
(b)
provides
that
in
determining
the
issue
of
voluntariness,
the
trial
judge
must
considered
all
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
giving
of
the
confession,
including,
among
others,
any
delay
in
presentment,
and
subsection
(c)
precludes
the
district
court
from
suppressing
a
confession
solely
because
of
delay
if
the
confession
was
voluntary
and
was
made
within
6
hours
of
the
defendant's
arrest.
the
ninth
circuit
thought,
or
concluded,
that
subsection
(c)
required
suppression
of
respondent's
confession.
it
reasoned
that
the
negative
implication
of
subsection
(c)
is
that
a
confession
made
more
than
6
hours
after
the
defendant's
arrest
may
be
suppressed
solely
because
of
delay,
even
if
it
is
voluntary
and
therefore
mandatorily
admissible
under
subsection
(a).
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
ninth
circuit
indicated
that
it
had
to,
in
effect,
carve
an
exception
to
subsection
(a)
in
order
to
give
meaning
to
the
negative
implication
from
subsection
(c),
and
in
light
of
its
conclusion
that
any
confession
that
falls
outside
of
the
6-hour
safe
harbor
may
be
suppressed
because
of
delay,
the
court
then
went
on
to
hold
that
the
confession
in
this
case
fell
outside
of
the
6-hour
safe
harbor
because
it
was
given
more
than
6
hours
after
the
arrest
by
the
california
authorities
on
friday,
rather
than
by
the
federal
authorities
on
monday.
now,
in
our
view,
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
to
start
the
6-hour
clock
running
with
the
state
arrest,
and
in
any
event,
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
to
conclude
that
a
negative
implication
from
subsection
(c)
should
override
an
express
affirmative
statement
in
subsection
(a).
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right,
your
honor.
we
can
win
this
case
either
by
your
holding
that
the
6-hour
clock
starts
ticking
with
the
federal
detention,
or
by
the
court
holding
that
the
negative
implication
of
subsection
(c)
does
not
trump
the
affirmative
statement
of
subsection
(a).
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
concede
that
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
state
officers
will
enforce
federal
law
under
any
set
of
circumstances,
and
in
circumstances
when
state
officers
are
taking
someone
into
custody
for
a
federal
crime,
for
example,
or
are
acting
for
the
federal
agents
rather
than
to
enforce
the
state's
own
laws.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
gist
of
our
claim,
of
our
view
in
this
case
is
that
subsection
(c)
is
directed
to
a
period
of
delay
between
the
defendant's
being
taken
into
custody
for
a
federal
offense
and
his
being
taken
in
front
of
a
federal
magistrate
under
rule
5(a).
that
was
the
subject
of
this
court's
supervisory
rule
under
the
mcnabb-mallory
line
of
cases,
and
is
actually
how
subsection
(c)
reads.
subsection
(c)
speaks
of
delay
in
bringing
the
defendant
before
a
magistrate
authorized
to
set
bail
for
federal
offenses.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
agree
that
the...
that
subsection
(c)
would
not
apply
in
those
circumstances,
and
the
reason
for
that
would
be
that
in
the
circumstances
that
you
have
described,
justice
scalia,
the
state
officers
would
not
in
fact
be
acting
as
a
cat's
paw
for
the
federal
agents.
if
the
state
officers
are
in
fact
acting
to
enforce
their
own
laws
rather
than
serving
merely
as
the
paw
for
the
federal
agents--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--if--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
if
it
is
a
bona
fide
state
arrest--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--and
there
are
questions
of
mixed
motive
everywhere
in
the
law,
but
if
in
fact
when
you
deal
with
it
on
those
terms
you
find
that
there
was
in
fact
a
bona
fide
crime,
and
a
bona
fide
state
arrest,
i
would
agree
with
you,
and
i
think
that
that
is
in
fact
a
desirable
result,
because
one
of
the
things
that
we
want
to
do
as
a
policy
matter
is
to
encourage
cooperation
between
law
enforcement
officers
in
states
with
the
federal
government.
it
is
only
when
the
action
is
to
evade,
and
only
to
evade,
the
requirements
of
rule
5(a)
that
we
think
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
been
taken
into
custody
as
the
act
of
the
federal
government,
and
in
making
that
point,
we
point
not
only
to
the
text
of
subsection
(c)
that,
of
course,
speaks
to
delay
in
bringing
the
defendant
in
front
of
a
federal
judge,
but
also
to
the
history
and
the
background
that
preceded
the
statute.
under
any
view
of
the
legislative
history,
section
3501
was
intended
at
least
to
limit
and
narrow
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule.
we
say
overrule,
but
at
least
under
any
view,
to
limit
and
narrow.
there
was
a
background
of
case
law
before
this
statute
that
said
that
state
arrests
would
not
be
considered
federal
for
these
purposes
unless
the
defendant
affirmatively
demonstrated
that
the
federal
agents
in
effect
used
the
state
as
a
cat's
paw
to
evade
rule
5,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--sure.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
it
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
law
enforcement
interest
for
the
state
in
taking
the
person
into
custody,
a
case
like,
for
example,
anderson,
in
which
there
might
have
been
some
state
law
enforcement
interest,
but
it's
clear
from
the
facts
that
that
is
in
fact
not
what
is
going
on,
or
a
case
in
which
the
conduct
at
issue
is
not
even
a
crime
under
state
law,
and
nonetheless
the
person
is
picked
up
solely
at
the
instance
of
the
federal
officers
to
allow
the
officers
a
period
of
time
to
question
the
defendant
without
complying
with
rule
5(a).
so
one
of
the
examples
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
in
fact
no
law
that
allows
the
state
to
do
what
it
is
doing,
so
there
is
in
fact
a
clear
inference,
hopefully
supported
by
other
facts,
that
all
that
is
going
on
is
that
the
federal
agents
are
using
the
state
to
do
their
bidding.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
hoped
that
that
would
be
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
that
is
the
view
that
the
second
circuit
took
of
your
case
anderson
in
the
coppola
case.
i
mean,
that
is
to
say
the
second
circuit
read
coppola
as
being
the
case
that
i
just...
the
second
circuit
read
anderson,
excuse
me,
as
being
the
case
that
i
just
posited
to
justice
ginsburg
and
this
court
affirmed,
so
yes,
while
that
would
be
a
rare
circumstance,
we're
not
saying
that
this
is
something
that
does
happen
or
indeed
should
happen
any
more
frequently
than
that.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
yes,
and
those--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
but
in
that
case
the
clock
would
start
ticking
from
the
point
when
they
took
it
upon
themselves
solely
to
enforce
federal
law,
and
we're
not
asking
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--sure.
i
mean,
we're
not
saying
that
the
only
case
in
which
we
get
tagged
with
the
conduct
of
the
state
is
a
case
in
which
we
have
wilfully
procured
the
state.
we
do
recognize
that
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
state
officers
would
undertake
to
enforce
federal
law,
and
we
would
want
them
to
do
so,
but
if
that
is
all
they're
doing,
once
they
have
taken
on
the
burden
to
enforce
federal
law,
they
have
to
comply
with
federal
law
throughout,
including
rule
5(a),
so
that
if
a
state
officer,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
stops
me
and
finds
out
that
i
have
a
federal
warrant
out
for...
for
my
arrest,
but
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
my
car,
or
there
is
no
other
state
reason
to
hold
me,
if
he
exercises
his
right
to
take
me
into
custody
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
i
have
a
federal
warrant,
he
has
to
comply
with
federal
law
and
take
me
to
a
judge
under
rule
5(a).
we're
certainly
not
saying
that
the
only
circumstance
that
gives
rise
to
the
state
conduct
being
tagged
to
us
is
the
typical
cat's
paw.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
yes,
justice
scalia.
if
he
wants
to
take
someone
into
custody
for
a...
for
a
federal
crime,
he
has
to
take
all
of
the
duties
that
come
with
taking
somebody
into
custody
by...
for
a
federal
crime,
and
those
include
taking
him
in
front
of
a
federal
judge
under
rule
5(a).
it
may
be
that
he's
ignorant
of
those,
but
if
in
fact
he
was
undertaking
to
further
the
federal
interest
and
fails
to
see
to
it
through
to
the
end
by
taking
him
to
the
judge,
we
see
nothing
unfair
in
our
being
tagged
with
that
time.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
sometimes.
not
frequently.
the
text
of
rule
5,
if
i
recall,
actually
speaks
of
a
person
making
an
arrest,
rather
than
a
federal
agent
making
an
arrest,
and
it
contemplates
a
broad
range
of
possible
instances
of
conduct,
including
the
old
notion
of
a
citizen's
arrest,
for
example.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
think,
under
our
view,
if
he
takes
someone
into
custody
for
a
state
offense,
his
duty
is
to
his
employer,
and
he
does
that
first,
and
anyone
who
then
wants
to
go
in
and
charge
the
person
with
a
federal
offense
would
have
to
take...
to
go
into
the
state's
domain,
as
it
were,
take
him
into
custody,
and
take
him
to
a
federal
judge,
but
we
would
not
consider
that
a
federal
arrest,
even
though
it
is
a
mixed
motive
type
situation.
because
if
there
is
in
fact
good
reason
for
holding
the
person
under
state
law
and
that
reason
is
intended
to
be
acted
on
by
the
state
officer,
we
haven't
yet
come
to
the
point
where
we
think
of
the
employees
of
the
state
as
being
there
solely
for
the
purpose
of
doing
our
bidding,
and
we
understand
that
they
have
to
comply
with
state
law,
and
that
that's
all
that
they
should
be
expected
to
do.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
would
think
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
we
think
that
in
subsection
(c)
it
could
be
a
state
officer--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--but
because
of
the
context,
only
when
acting
to
enforce
federal
law.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
our
point
is
that
if
a
state
officer
undertakes
to
take
someone
into
custody
for
a
federal
crime,
he
is
enforcing
state
law,
and
he
falls
under
the
terms
of
subsection
(c)
and
starts
the
6-hour
clock
running.
of
course,
the
prerequisite
for
that
is
that
he
be
enforcing
federal
law,
because
we
think
that
even
though
the
section
doesn't
limit
the
identity
of
the
officer
who
acts,
it
does
limit
the
subject
matter
of
what
he's
acting
on,
and
by
highlighting
delay,
and
since
one
can
rarely
be
late
for
any
sort
of
appointment
one
hasn't
made,
the
statute
very
clearly
indicates
that
is
making
reference
to
an
event
that
gives
rise
to
a
duty
to
take
someone
in
front
of
a
federal
judge
and,
in
our
view,
that
is
only
an
arrest
for
a
federal
crime,
and
as
we
say,
that
is
also
consistent
with
the
historical
background
of
the
rule.
as
to
our
second
point,
even
if
it
were
true
that
an
arrest
for
a
state
offense
starts
the
6-our
clock
running,
we
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
conclude
that
a
confession
made
more
than
6
hours
after
the
arrest
necessarily
must
be
suppressed.
it
is
not
the
case
with
safe
harbors
that
if
your
ship
wanders
out
of
one
of
them
it
is
automatically
sunk.
subsection
(c)
says
that
suppression
is
precluded
if
the
confession
is
voluntary
and
made
within
6
hours
of
delay...
made
within
6
hours
of
the
arrest,
excuse
me,
solely
on
the
basis
of
delay,
but
it
says
nothing
about
any
confessions,
and
we
think
that
those
are
left
to
generally
applicable
principles
of
law,
including
subsection
(a),
which
mandates
that
all
voluntary
confessions
must
be
admitted.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
under
subsection
(b),
as
we
read
the
three
subsections,
subsection
(a)
says
that
the
sole
test
is
voluntariness.
subsection
(b)
says
you
may
consider
delay
as
one
factor,
and
subsection
(c)
in
effect,
even
though
it
is
somewhat
complicated,
we
concede,
says
that
in
determining
subsection...
the
question
under
subsection
(b),
the
court
should
not
let
delay
of
less
than
6
hours
tip
the
balance
in
favor
of
involuntariness.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--there
is
no
seamless
way
of
construing
this
statute,
justice
scalia,
and
we
recognize
that.
i
think
that
there
are
many
less
charitable
things
that
one
could
say
about
subsection
(c)
than
what
you
just
said,
but
in
order
to
make
it
fit
better
with
the
balance
of
the
statute,
what
we
do,
quite
candidly,
is
to
read
subsection
(c)
as
if
it
said,
and
it
otherwise
can
be--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--which
i
think
is
consistent
with
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at,
and
in
that
connection
i
should
point
out
that
the
clause,
if
it
is
voluntary,
was
in
the
bill
that
came
out
of
committee
and
went
onto
the
floor,
so
that
to
the
extent
that
every
party
in
front
of
the
court
concedes
that
that
bill
was
designed
to
do
away
with
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
for
good--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--is
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
justice
scalia,
you
asked
me
the
last
question,
and
i'm
hoping
that
he
won't
ask
any.
[laughter]
no,
but
to
the
extent,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
stevens,
that
every
party
before
the
court
concedes
that
the
bill
that
came
out
of
committee
was
clearly
intended
to
do
away
with
mcnabb-mallory
for
good,
the
structural
problems
with
the
bill
were
already
present
at
the
time
that
the
bill
came
onto
the
floor,
and
in
fact,
with
senator
scott's
change
on
the
floor,
it
makes
a
little
bit
more
sense
now
than
it
did
as
it
came
out
of
the
committee.
conceding
that
the
prose
of
subsection
(c)
is
less
than
what
might
be
called
limpid,
the
key
in
trying
to
get
an
understanding
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do,
we
think,
is
to...
is
to
understand
that
from
the
outset,
the
subsection
that
was
carrying
all
of
the
water
to
overrule
mcnabb-mallory
was
subsection
(a)
and
not
subsection
(c).
subsection
(a)...
excuse
me...
said,
if
it
is
voluntary,
you
must
let
it
in.
subsection
(b)
says,
consider
delay.
subsection
(c)
in
effect
is
a
tool
to
keep
judges
from
overvaluing
or
overrating
delay
in
making
the
judgment
in
(b),
or
in
(b)(1),
and
once
you
understand
that
subsection
(c)
was
related
to
the
mcnabb-mallory
problem
but
was
not...
but
that
it
was
not
itself
the
vehicle
for
overruling
mcnabb-mallory,
one
sees
what
the
problem
that
senator
scott
has
with
it.
as
it
came
out
onto
the
floor,
it
said,
you
may
not
consider
delay
as
the
tipping
factor,
or
as
the
one
factor
that
would
make
something
involuntary,
ever.
his
point
is,
i
can
think
of
cases
in
which,
if
you
have
an
extremely
long
delay,
that
factor
will
be
the
factor
that
will
make
a
confession
involuntary.
what
we
do
is,
we
put
a
limit
on
subsection
(c)
to
say
that
after
a
period
of
6
hours,
a
district
judge
is
free
to
consider
delay
as
a
factor,
as
a
full
factor,
and
maybe
even
as
the
principal
factor.
is
it
elegant?
no,
but
we
do
think
that
it
makes
sense
out
of
every
subsection
of
the
statute
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
can
be
made
sense
of.
now...
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
point
to
in
giving
that
construction
to
the
subsection
is
the
overriding
impetus
for
every
subsection
of
the
statute.
if
you
step
back
and
look
at
the
statute,
what
the
statute
in
effect
says
is,
don't
suppress
because
of
x,
don't
suppress
because
of
y,
don't
suppress
because
of
z,
and
one
has
to
work
really
hard
with
the
language
of
the
statute
and
practically
ignore
all
of
the
legislative
history
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
statute
a
rule
that
says,
suppress,
and
by
the
way,
it's
mandatory,
and
that
is
our
sole
point
as
to
subsection
(c).
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
justices.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank

justice.
only
a
couple
of
points.
first,
the
concession
that
counsel
read
in
our
reply
brief
on
the
merits
was
made
also
in
our
reply
brief
at
the
cert
stage,
and
we
merely
repeated
it
in
our
reply
brief
on
the
merits
because
he
made
the
same
argument
in
his
brief
on
the
merits
that
he
made
in
his
opposition.
at
page
1
through
2
of
our
reply
brief
on
the
cert
stage,
we
deal
with
his
argument
of
any
law
enforcement
officer
with
the
following:
"that
claim,
however,
is
irrelevant
to
our
submission.
"
"we
do
not
content
that
arrests
by
state
officers
cannot
qualify
under
section
3501(c).
"
"our
contention,
instead,
is
that
the
arrest,
whether
by
federal
or
state
officers,
must
be
for
a
violation
of
federal
law.
"
"only
such
an
arrest
can
sensibly
be
viewed
as
imposing
upon
the
arresting
officer
the
duty
to
bring
such
person
before
a
magistrate
or
other
officer
empowered
to
commit
persons
charged
with
offenses
against
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
"
that
is
from
our
reply
brief
at
the
petition
stage.
our
second
point
is
that
the
basis
for
a
person
having
been
taken
into
custody
is
often
litigated
in
state
and
federal
courts,
because
claims
that
the
arrest
was
made
without
probable
cause
are
a
means
for
seeking
the
suppression
of
physical
evidence
seized
at
the
time
the
person
was
taken
into
custody,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
as
a
matter
of
routine
in
federal
court,
officers,
state
and
federal,
are
called
on
to
explain
what
the
basis
for
their
conduct
was
at
the
time
when
it
was
taken,
i.e.,
what
law
they
thought
was...
what
law
they
thought
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
was
being
violated.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions,
we
will
rest
on
our
briefs.
