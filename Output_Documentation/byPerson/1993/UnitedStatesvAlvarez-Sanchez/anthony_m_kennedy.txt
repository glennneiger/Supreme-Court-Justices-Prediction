justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
i
take
it,
to
indicate
that
the
state
officers
deliberately
delayed
in
calling
the
federal
people
into
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
a
confession--
--i
don't--
--is
made
within
6
hours,
but
there
is
a
charge
of
involuntariness,
is
time
a
factor
that
the
judge
may
consider?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
booked
the
defendant
on
the
state
charge
only.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
incorrect
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
booking
sheet
or
something
in
the
appendix
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
assume
any
officer
knows
why
he
is
holding
a
defendant,
a
suspect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he's
being
held
on
a
charge.
