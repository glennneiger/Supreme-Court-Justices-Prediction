justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
give
us
an
example
of
what,
in
your
estimation,
would
be
a
cat's
paw
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
isn't
the
one
that
justice
scalia
gave.
justice

where
is
the
concession
in
the
reply
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
the
primary
addressee
of
this
310...
whatever
it
is,
is
really
the
state
officer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
might
not
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
you're
saying
is
that
this...
your
reading
of
the
statute
puts
pressure
on
the
state
officer
to
contact
the
federal
officer
promptly,
and
yet
this
is
a
code
directed
to
federal
officers,
not
state
officers.
