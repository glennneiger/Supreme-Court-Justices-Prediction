the
trouble
is
that
that
limitation
would
not
allow
in...
would
not
make
the
rule
apply
when
the
state
officers
are
acting
as
the
cat's
paw
for
the
federal
officers.
that
is
to
say,
so
long
as
it's
a
genuine
arrest
for
a
state
crime,
and
there's
no
anticipation
that
he's
going
to
be
drawn
before
a
federal
magistrate,
the
federal
officers
can,
working
hand-in-glove
with
the
state
officers,
induce
them
to
hold
the
prisoner
for
too
long
without
presenting
him--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
not
merely.
i
mean,
in
my
hypothetical,
they
are
acting
as
the
cat's
paw
of
the
federal
officers
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
confession
to
a
federal
crime--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
arrest
is
for
a
state
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
he
take
them...
you
say
he
takes
them
to
a
judge's...
he's
arrested...
he's
a
state
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
arrested
him
for
a
federal
crime.
he
takes
him
to
a
federal
judge?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
happen,
you
have
state
officers
coming
before
federal
magistrates
regularly?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
a
state
officer
arrests
somebody
for
both
state
and
federal
offenses?
does
he
have
to
come
before
a
state
magistrate
for
the
state
offenses
and
a
federal
magistrate
for
the
federal
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
really
doesn't
say
that.
i
don't
see
how
(c)
is
a
safe...
maybe
you
can
explain
how
(c)
can
be
a
safe
harbor
when
it's
only
made
a
safe
harbor
if
the
confession
is
voluntary.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
confession
isn't
voluntary
if
one
of
the
problems
with
it
is
that
there
was
too
much
time
elapsing
between
arrest
and
arraignment.
i
don't
see
how
you
ever
get
to...
it's
perfectly
circular.
it
really
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
otherwise--
justice
antonin
scalia
--look
at
justice
stevens
when
you
say
this,
mr.
estrada,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
look
at
me
when
you're
talking
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
do
you
read
section
(c)?
what
does
it
mean
to
you?
it
does
nothing
at
all,
then,
under
your
analysis,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
goes
on
to
say
it
shall
not
be
inadmissible
because
of
delay
in
bringing
such
person
before
a
magistrate
or
other
officer
empowered
to
commit
persons
charged
with
offenses
against
laws
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
no
sense,
unless
you're
talking
about
a
federal
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
violate
this
provision
even
if
he
took
the
individual
before
a
state
magistrate
promptly?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's
not
at
all,
not
the
way
you
interpret
it.
