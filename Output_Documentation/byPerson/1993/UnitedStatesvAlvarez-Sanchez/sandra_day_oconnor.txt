mr.
estrada,
if
we
were
to
decide
that
the
arrest
or
detention
that
starts
the
time
clock
running
is
really
only
one
involving
federal
officials,
then
does
that
end
the
case?
we
wouldn't
then
have
to
decide
the
meaning
of
the
6-hour
limitation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you
concede
that
the
language,
any
law
enforcement
agency,
can
indeed
refer
to
state
agencies
in
the
event
they
are
acting
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
making
a
federal
arrest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
arrest
that
triggers
it
has
to
be
one
that
gives
rise
to
the
need
to
take
someone
to
a
federal
magistrate--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
you'd
have
to
focus
on
what
it
is
that
triggers
the
operation
of
the
statute,
to
wit,
an
arrest
for
an
offense
that
requires
presentation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--before
the
magistrate.
