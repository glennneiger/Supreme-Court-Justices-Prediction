justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
was
arrested
on
state
narcotics
charges
by
local
police
officers
on
a
friday
afternoon.
on
the
following
monday,
while
he
was
still
in
local
custody,
he
confessed
to
the
united
states
secret
service
that
he
had
known
that
the
currency
found
in
his
possession
by
the
police
was
counterfeit.
the
agents
arrested
respondent
on
federal
charges
of
unlawful
possession
of
counterfeit
currency.
he
subsequently
was
convicted
of
this
offense
after
a
jury
trial
at
which
his
confession
was
admitted
into
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
the
conviction
holding
that
respondent's
confession
should
have
been
suppressed
under
18
u.s.c.
3501(c),
part
of
the
federal
statute
governing
the
admissibility
of
confessions
in
federal
prosecutions.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
section
3501(c)
provides
that
if
certain
conditions
have
met,
a
confession
made
by
a
person
while
under
arrest
or
detention
shall
not
be
inadmissible
in
a
subsequent
prosecution
solely
because
of
delay
in
bringing
such
person
before
a
judicial
officer
empowered
to
commit
persons
charged
with
offenses
against
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
statutory
term
"delay"
presumes
an
obligation
to
act.
there
can
be
no
delay
in
presenting
a
person
to
a
federal
magistrate
until
there
is
some
obligation
to
bring
the
person
before
such
a
judicial
officer.
such
a
duty
does
not
arise
until
the
person
has
been
arrested
for
a
federal
offense.
thus,
no
delay
for
purposes
of
section
3501(c)
can
occur
until
a
person
is
arrested
on
a
federal
charge.
in
context
then,
the
arrest
or
other
detention
of
which
the
subsection
speaks
is
an
arrest
or
other
detention
for
violation
of
federal
law.
in
this
case,
respondent
was
under
arrest
on
state
narcotics
charges
at
the
time
he
made
his
confession
to
the
secret
service
agents.
the
terms
of
section
3501(c),
thus,
did
not
apply
to
his
statement,
and
therefore,
section
3501(c)
did
not
authorize
suppression
of
the
confession.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
joins;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
