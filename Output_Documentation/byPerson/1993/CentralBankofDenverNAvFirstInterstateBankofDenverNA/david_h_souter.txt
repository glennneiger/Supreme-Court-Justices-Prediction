justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you're
arguing
here
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
aiding
and
abetting
liability,
period.
you're
not
arguing
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
aiding
and
abetting
only
in
the
case
of
the
innocent
aider
and
abettor.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
all
agreed
that
congress
didn't
provide
any
indicia
of
intent.
you
can't
blame
them
for
doing
what
we
all
concede
wouldn't
work.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question,
as
justice
scalia
raised,
is
whether
it
really
falls
within
sort
of
the
rounding-out
jurisprudence,
and
i
mean,
justice
kennedy's
point
is
that
they
could
have
been
pursued
on
a
conspiracy
theory,
and
at
least
on
traditional
tort
principles
that
would
not
have
been
regarded
as
a
departure,
and
if
that's
so,
why
should
this
be
regarded
as
a
departure?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
this
case
you've
got
one
other
ingredient.
they
took
another
$2
million
in
collateral
in
order
to
be
quiet,
didn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
this
case
you've
got
another
factual
ingredient,
because
the
bank
took
another
$2
million
of
collateral
in
order
to
be
quiet
about
it
until
after
the
'88
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
it
did,
but
they
accepted
the
collateral
for
that
earlier
bond
issue
as
part
of
their...
or
as
the
consideration
for
their
agreement
to
insist
on
no
immediate
reappraisal.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
overlap.
they're
not
identical.
i
mean,
it's
fair
to
say
that
we
wouldn't
find
it
appropriate
to
round
out
unless
congress
would
have
created
the
liability
on
the
premise
of
what
we've
done
so
far,
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
everything
that
congress
would
have
done
would
amount
to
rounding
out
for
existing
kinds
of
action,
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you're
talking
about
aiding
and
abetting
someone
else
who
might
deceive
or
manipulate,
i
take
it
that
it
would
be
a
requirement
that
the
aider
and
abettor
at
least
appreciate
that
there
may
be
someone
in
a
position
to
manipulate
or
to
deceive
who
would
be
helped
by
the
aider
and
abettor's
conduct.
the
aider
and
abettor
may
not
have
to
make
an
agreement
with
this
primary
defendant,
and
perhaps
the
aider
and
abettor
wouldn't
have
to
know
that
this
primary
defendant
was
about
to
manipulate
or
deceive,
but
the
aider
and
abettor
would
have
to
know
that
someone
was
in
a
position
to
do
that.
and
isn't
that
perhaps
the
answer
to
the
problem
that
we've
got,
that
it's
perfectly
true,
you
do
have
to
have
some
kind
of
knowledge
in
order
to
put
yourself
into
the
category
of
aiding
and
abetting,
but
that
knowledge
is
sufficient
if
you
know
that
someone...
not
necessarily
the
primary
defendant
that
we
later
identify,
but
someone
is
in
a
position
to
deceive
and
manipulate,
and
your
gross
deviation
would
aid
or
abet
that
enterprise?
isn't
that
the
knowledge
that
is
required
that
is
sort
of
peculiar
to
recklessness
in
a
context
like
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
saying...
i
think
justice
scalia
and
i
both
understood
you
to
mean
that
the
aider
and
abettor's
act,
as
it
were,
can
come
first,
before
he
knows
of
anyone
in
particular,
or
anyone
in
general
that
is
likely--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
he
has
to
know...
you're
saying
that
he
has
to
know
that
someone
may
be
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
what
he's
doing.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
