although
as
i
understand
it
you
didn't
question
that
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
ruled
simply
on
the
state
of
mind
question,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
have
been
fruitless
because
the
law
was
so
solidly
against
you
in
the
lower
courts,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
and
your
argument
would
cover
the
sec
as
well,
as
it's
not
limited
to...
you're
talking
about
a
private
right
of
action
here,
but
if
there
is
no
aiding
and
abetting
liability,
then
the
sec
could
not
go
after
it
either,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
silent
as
to
the
commission
as
well
as
the
individual.
i'm...
what
i'm
trying
to
understand
is
if
you
are
acknowledging,
or
you're
saying
i
don't
have
to
answer
that
question,
that
the
sec
could
similarly...
if
you're
correct,
it's
not
aiding
and
abetting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you--
--but
why
is
that
so
clear?
why
couldn't
one
say
that
deliberately
delaying
the
time
that
this
property
would
be
reappraised
was
a
manipulative
practice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
trautman,
in
your
response
to
me,
were
you
suggesting
that
there
must
be
a
duty
to
disclose,
otherwise
you
can't
have
liability
as
a
principle,
and
if
so,
what
case
held
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
the
tenth
circuit
define
recklessness?
they
didn't
say,
extreme
lack
of
care,
or
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gersh,
do
you
concede
that
you
could
not
have
charged
central
bank
as
a
primary
violator
so
that
you
were
forced
into
the
aiding
and
abetting
mode?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
concede
that.
