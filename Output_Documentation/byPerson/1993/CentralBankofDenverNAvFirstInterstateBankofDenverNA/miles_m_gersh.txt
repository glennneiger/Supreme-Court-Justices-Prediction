mr.
miles
m.
gersh
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
the
aiding
and
abetting
remedy
which
has
been
developed
over
30
years
by
the
lower
federal
courts
in
hundreds
of
cases
and
which
has
been
approved
and
applied
by
every
one
of
the
federal
appellate
courts
is
a
fully
actionable
part
of
the
10b-5
cause.
this
court
said
6
months
ago
in
musick,
peeler
that
we
must
confront
the
law
in
its
current
form,
and
the
current
form
of
the
law
is
that
there
is
a
section
10(b)
private
action,
that
it
reaches
primary
violators,
and
after
musick,
peeler
it
reaches
at
least
one
form
of
joint
tortfeasors...
that
is,
contributors...
and
this
case
raises
the
question
or
the
issue
about
a
different
form
of
joint
tortfeasor,
that
is,
aiders
and
abettors.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
contribution,
justice
rehnquist,
it's
correct...
chief
justice...
is
a
different
form,
in
other
words,
of
secondary
liability
from
aiding
and
abetting.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
it...
in
other
words,
it's
not
allocation
among
primarily
liable
parties.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--that's
correct.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
that
is
a
difference,
justice
kennedy.
i...
in
the
musick,
peeler
case,
though,
the
court
was
answering
or
asking
and
answering
the
basic
question
about
whether
this...
this
remedy,
this
cause,
this
right
contribution
was
a
part
of
the
10b-5
action
or
separate,
how
it
should
be
treated.
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
about
conspiracy,
whether
that...
in
the
sense
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
is
relevant
here
today,
whether
that's
a
separate
cause
of
action,
and
really
the
relevant
case
there
is
this
court's
decision
in
curran,
where
there
was
an
implied
action
under
the
commodity
futures
act.
and
the
court
said,
in
the
course
of
considering
whether
there
should
be
a
conspiracy,
an
action...
a
right
against
conspirators,
that
because
there
was
an
implied
action
that
the
court
had
recognized,
that
it
necessarily
followed
that
there
should
be
a
right
against
conspirators,
and
in
a
similar
context
in
the
case
cited
by
the
sec
in
their
brief,
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
v.
hydrolevel,
there
you
had
an
express
private
action
under
the
sherman
act,
and
the
question
there
was
whether
there
should
be
a
right
against
an
employer
on
an
agency
theory,
and
similarly
there,
the
courts
said,
looking
at
the
common
law
and
saying
that
the
agency
theory
was
well-established
in
the
common
law,
that
to
be
faithful
to
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
the
express
private
action,
that
the
case
should
reach
beyond
primary
violators
to
an
agency
theory.
all
of
these,
we
would
say,
these
cases
that
i've
just
been
discussing...
musick,
peeler
in
respect
to
contribution,
asme
in
respect
to
employer
liability,
the
curran
case
in
respect
to
conspiracy,
and
here
in
this
case,
aiding
and
abetting...
what
they
do,
although
these
are
different
forms
of
joint
tortfeasor
liability,
they
are
all
questions
which
arise
in
different
contexts
under
existing
private
actions,
and
this
is
a
question
of
aiding
and
abetting
liability,
another
form...
different,
but
another
form
of
joint
tortfeasor
liability
under
an
existing
cause
of
action,
the
section
10(b)
action.
the
court
has
said
another
way
to
look
at
it--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--i
think
the
court--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--in
the
aiding
and
abetting
cause,
your
honor,
the
first
element,
justice
scalia,
would
be
that
there
was
a
primary
violation,
so--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--the
link...
at
least
with
aiding
and
abetting,
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
direct
link
to
the
primary
violation
in
the
first
element
of
the
aiding
and
abetting
cause.
that
is,
the
existence
of
a
primary
violation.
we
do
have
to
show
that.
we
had
to
show
that
in
this
case.
we
had
to
show
that
there
was
a
fraud
by
the
developer,
and
we
did
do
that,
and
had
we
not
done
that,
we
couldn't...
we
wouldn't
have
gotten
past
summary
judgment
on
that
issue.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
if
they
had--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--knowledge,
participation...
knowledge
and
substantial
assistance
in
a
primary
violation
would
all
have
to
be
proved
with
respect
to
that
lawyer.
it
wouldn't
be
enough
just--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--it
would
have
to
be,
justice
o'connor,
not
just
assistance
to
the
bank,
but
substantial
assistance
in
the
fraud.
in
her
words,
mr.
trautman
has
suggested
that
the
court
were...
here's
a
cause
or
a
remedy
which
can
gather
up
all
kinds
of
professionals
who
participate
in
these
kinds
of
transactions,
and
they're
all
going
to
be
doing
something,
but
what
they
aren't
all
going
to
be
doing,
and
that's
the
purpose
and
the
direct
object
of
the
aiding
and
abetting
remedy,
is
they're
not
all
going
to
be
substantially
assisting
a
fraud.
we
didn't
charge
central
bank...
we
didn't
draw
our
complaint
in
this
case
just
because
they
were
helping
in
a
bond
deal.
we
drew
it
because
they
were
substantially,
actively
assisting
a
fraud,
and
that
would
have
to
be
the
proof
with
respect
to
that
lawyer
or
these
other
professionals.
in
the...
in
the--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--yes.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
yes,
i
would
concede
that.
central
bank
here
did
not...
the
primary
violation
here
was
a
fraudulent
bond
deal
that
was
portrayed
in
an
official
statement
that
misrepresented
the
crucial
aspect
of
this
transaction,
which
was
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
backed
by
property
that
was
worth
160
percent
of
the
principal
amount
of
the
bonds,
and
that's
the
primary
wrongdoing,
that
fraudulent
official
statement.
central
bank's
role,
and
the
only
way
that
we
could
reach
them
under
the
securities
laws...
and
it
was
a
critical
role,
but
was
one
of
assisting,
actively,
substantially
aiding
and
abetting
that
fraud
by
a
series
of
acts,
not
just
one.
not
just
delaying
the
appraisal,
but
a
series
of
acts
over
a
period
of
2
or
3
months
that
had
the
effect
of
making
certain
that
the
defects
of
that
appraisal
would
never
be
known
until
it
was
much
too
late...
6
months
after
the
bond
deal
went
into
effect.
the...
another
way
to
put
this
issue,
besides
as
a
pleading
matter,
whether
it's
separate
or
not
separate...
and
we
can
talk
about
that
in
various
ways.
in
some
respects
it
is
separate
from
the
core,
from
primary
liability,
in
some
ways
it's
not,
but
the
most
relevant
aspect
of
separateness
is
whether
the
remedy
or
the
issue
that
arises
would
have
been
included
by
the
congress
or
thought
to
be
within
the
scope
of
the
10b-5
action
had
that
action
been
provided
for
expressly.
that's
the...
we
would
suggest
the
most
relevant
sense
of
separate
or
not,
and
in
that
most
relevant
sense,
the
indicia
that
this
court
has
used
to
determine
the
intent
and
purpose
and
scope
of
10b-5
and
issues
that
arise
under
it,
this
is
not
a
separate
cause.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
this
is
one
of
those
items
that
will
round
out
an
existing
cause
of
action.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
justice
scalia,
i
would
say
that
the
rounding
out
test
is
related
in
this
sense,
that
there
is
no
rounding
out
doctrine
in
any
of
the
court
rounding
out
cases...
lampf,
musick,
peeler...
that
is
separate
from
the
question
of
how
congress
would
have
originally
designed
the
cause
of
action.
the
courts,
even
where
there
was
an
express
cause
of
action...
actually,
the
curran
case
is
another
good
example
of
this...
are
not
at
large
simply
to
round
out
a
cause,
or
that
cause
of
action
when
another
issue
comes
to
them.
they
have
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
is
faithful
to
the
scope
of
the
express
cause
of
action,
and
in
that
sense
the
question,
the
rounding
out
question,
is
the
same
one.
in
other
words,
is
the
section
10(b)
action
as
designed
by
the
congress
one
within
which
the
aiding
and
abetting
remedy
would
have
a
part,
and
we
say--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--no,
i
think
that
that's...
i
think
that
that's
true.
we
would
say
that
in...
that
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
aiding
and
abetting
would
be
within
the
purpose,
within
the
intent,
or
scope,
or
contour
of
the
10b-5
private
action,
is
answerable
by
looking
at
the
same
sources
of
intent,
congressional
purpose,
that
the
court
has
looked
at
in
other
cases
in
its
10(b)
jurisprudence.
first,
at
the
background
of...
the
common
law
background
of
the
section
10(b)
action,
and
there,
with
respect
to
aiding
and
abetting,
the
answer
we
would
submit
is
a
clear
one,
that
aiding
and
abetting
had
a
place
in
the
common
law
when
the
1934
congress
came
to
its
job
in
enacting
10(b),
but
it
went
back--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--your
honor...
justice
kennedy,
i
would
agree.
we
have
cited
cases
going
back
to
the
1800's,
and
i
don't
think
that
central
bank
in
any
of
its
briefs
has
cited
anything
to
the
contrary
in...
in...
and
therefore,
the
point
of
that
is
simply
that,
as
this
court
has
said,
it
was
one
of
the
undoubted
purposes
of
congress,
when
it
came
to
its
task
in
1934,
to
correct
perceived
deficiencies
of
the
common
law.
and
therefore
had
this...
had
the
congress
considered
aiding
and
abetting
in
1934,
it
would
not
have
left
it
out
of
a
private
action
had
it...
if
it
had
done
that,
it
would
have
taken
a
step
backward
in
the
opposite
direction
from
bolstering
the
protections
for
investors,
and
so
the
common
law
is
a
powerful
demonstration
that
aiding
and
abetting
belongs
within
the
scope
and
the
purpose
of
the
10b-5
remedy
that
the
congress
enacted.
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
recklessness
point,
very
briefly,
in
the
time
that
i
have
remaining.
the
recklessness
issue
has
to
be
analyzed,
first
of
all,
in
the
same
way,
in
a
way
that
is
faithful
to
the
purpose
of
congress
in
the
10b-5
action
itself,
and
if
you
start
with
the
common
law,
recklessness
also,
as
a
matter
of
satisfying
the
scienter
or
the
culpable
state
of
mind
requirement,
has
a
history
that
goes
back
really
into
the
19th
century
in
the
common
law
of
deceit
that
the
congress
was
looking
at
when
they
developed
the
10b-5
action,
and
to
this--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--i'm
not
certain
about
conspiracy,
but
as
to
aiding--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--as
for
aiding
and
abetting,
the
cases
of
aiding
and
abetting
common
law
deceit,
the
ones
that
we
located,
do
say
that...
include
recklessness,
or
reach
recklessness,
your
honor,
so
as
to
the
aiding
and
abetting,
the
history
of
aiding
and
abetting,
recklessness
was
the
standard
there
as
well.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
i
think
we
cite
these
cases--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--in
the
footnote,
which
is
on
page
34
of
our
brief,
footnote
number
27,
we
cite
a
number
of
these
cases,
and
then
i
think
we
also
in
the
text
cite...
we
do
cite
in
the
text
several
aiding
and
abetting
cases
as
well.
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
actually,
justice
scalia,
if
you
look
at
the...
if
you
look
at
the
criminal
law,
which
if
anything
should
have
a
more
stringent
form
of
intent,
the
criminal
law
uses
recklessness,
or
defines
the
intent
necessary
for
aiding
and
abetting
as
reckless,
at
least
in
some
of
the
cases,
and
it's...
the
level
of
intent
required
for
aiding
and
abetting
has
been
considered
to
be
a
general
intent,
closer
to
general
intent
and
not
specific
intent.
there's--
mr.
miles
m.
gersh
--i
would
agree,
justice
souter,
and
i
would
also
add
to
that
that
the
recklessness
standard
is
a
stringent
one.
as
presented
by
central
bank
it
would
seem
not
to
be,
but
it
requires...
to
complete
that,
it
requires
that
the
risk
of
the
harm
be
so
obvious
that
it
must
have
been
known
to
the
defendant,
and
in
that
sense
it's
tantamount
to
actual
knowledge.
i
thank
the
court.
