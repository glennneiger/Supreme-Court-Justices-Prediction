may
i
ask
you,
counsel,
if
you
would
concede
that
recklessness
is
a
sufficient
mens
rea
to
satisfy
any
scienter
requirement
for
primary
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
would
you
answer
the
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
held
that
recklessness
is
sufficient--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
primary
liability--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
same?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
might
approach
it
just
the
other
way
and
say
clearly
its
enough
under
primary--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--liability
and
why
shouldn't
it
be
enough
if
there's
aiding
and
abetting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gersh,
would
liability
as
an
aider
and
abettor
be
available
as
a
theory
for
your
client
against
the
lawyer
that
advised
the
bank,
and
perhaps
the
accountant--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
well
as
the
bank?
the
lawyer
was
aware
of
what
the
bank
was
doing
in
connection
with
this
transaction.
now,
under
your
theory
of
aiding
and
abetting,
the
lawyer
perhaps
could
have
been
made
liable
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
assistance
to
the
bank
to
do
whatever
the
bank
was
doing.
