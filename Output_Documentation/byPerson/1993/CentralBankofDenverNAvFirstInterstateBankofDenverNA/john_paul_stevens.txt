may
i
just
ask
one
other
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
delay.
it
was
discretionary.
did
they
have
the
authority
under
their
agreement,
under
the
indenture,
to
insist
that
the
appraisal
not
be
delayed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
whether
they
did
it
or
not
was
entirely
discretionary,
no
standards
about
whether
they
had
any
duty
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why,
under
the
agreement,
did
they
have
anything
to
say
about
the
appraisal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
the
decision
of
whether
to
delay
or
not
delay
the
appraisal
be
a
ministerial
act,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
there's
some
tension
between
the
notion
that
it's
a
discretionary
matter
and
it's
a
ministerial
matter.
it
seems
to
me
one
of
those
would
be
correct,
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
both
could
be
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
duties
of
the
indenture
trustee
are
not
entirely
ministerial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
all
of
them
have,
haven't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
