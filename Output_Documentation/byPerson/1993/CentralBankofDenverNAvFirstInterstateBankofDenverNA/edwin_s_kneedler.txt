mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
recently
reaffirmed
in
musick,
peeler
that
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
federal
courts
to
give
content
to
and
round
out
the
private
right
of
action
that
has
been
recognized
under
section
10(b)
of
the
'34
act
and
the
commission's
implementing
rule,
10b-5.
for
the
past
30
years,
the
lower
federal
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
aiders
and
abettors
are
properly
named
as
defendants
in
suits
under
10(b)
and
10b-5.
there
are
hundreds
of
such
reported
decisions
in
the
lower
courts.
in
our
view,
a
practice
that
is
so
embedded
in
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
securities
laws
should
not
lightly
be
overturned.
in
our
view
there...
not
only
are
there
no
compelling
reasons
for
doing
so,
but
the
relevant
indicia
that
this
court
has
looked
to
in
giving
content
to
the
10b-5
cause
of
action
all
strongly
reinforce
the
existence
of
aider
and
abettor
liability.
first
of
all
is
the
very
practice
that
has
gone
on
for
30
years,
a
point
the
court
noted
in
musick,
peeler,
that
the
experience
of
the
lower
federal
courts
is
itself
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account,
but
turning
to
the
text
of
the
securities
laws
themselves,
section
10(b),
in
statutory
terms,
is
written
very
expansively,
referring
to
any
person
who
directly
or
indirectly
engages
in
the
conduct
to
which
the
section
speaks,
language
that
is
broad
enough
in
itself
to
include
aiders
and
abettors,
especially
given
the
common
law
background,
and
we
cite
a
case
of
this
court
going
back
to
1869
holding
aiders
and
abettors
liable
in
common
law
fraud.
read
against
that
background,
and
the
background
of
protecting
investors,
the
language
of
section
10(b)
itself
is
a
basis
for
finding
aider
and
abettor
liability.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
this
is
just
the
existence
of
aider
and
abettor
liability
on
that
case,
your
honor.
but
beyond
that,
there
are
a
number
of
other
important
indicia
in
the
securities
laws
themselves.
for
example...
well,
not
in
the
securities
laws.
i
think
i
would
start
with
18
u.s.
c
section
2,
which
is
significant
here.
it
provides
that
an
aider
and
abettor
is
liable
as
a
principal,
and
we
think
that
is
significant,
that
in
terms
of
giving
content
to
the
private
right
of
action
under
section
10(b),
it
is
important
to
look
to
the
persons
whom
congress
has
deemed
to
be
responsible
when
a
violation
of
10(b)
occurs
and
section
2
of
title
18
makes
absolutely
clear
that
congress
deemed
a
person
who
aids
and
abets
a
violation
of
section
10(b)
to
be
responsible.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
my
point
is
that
as
applied
to
section
10(b),
congress
has
deemed
and
in
fact
held
criminally
responsible
persons
who
substantially
participate
in
a
violation
of
section
10(b).
in
other
words,
in
terms
of
rounding
out
the
cause
of
action,
it's
not
necessary
to
find
that
congress
had
a
specific
intent
under...
in
enacting
title
18
with
respect
to
section
10(b).
my
point
is
simply
that
congress
has
deemed
that
a
person
who
aids
and
assists
any
violation
of
a
law
to
be
liable,
and
not
only
liable,
liable
as
a
principal,
who
has
substantially
participated
and
therefore
is
equally
culpable.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
the
criminal
law
context,
you
would
of
course
need
a
statute
to
say
who
is
responsible,
and
the
reason
the
congress
had
adopted...
enacted
section
2,
as
this
court
said
in
standefer,
was
to,
for
example,
overcome
the
common
law
rule
that
if
the
principal
is
acquitted
the
aider
and
abettor
could
not
be
found
liable,
and
congress
wanted
to
eliminate
that
artificial
distinction.
after
all,
someone
who
substantially
participates
in
a
violation
of
the
law
is
quite
culpable
in
bringing
about
the
injury
in
this
case
to
the
plaintiff,
so
we
think
that
section
2
is
very
important,
because
it
not
only
identifies
whom
congress
thought
was
responsible,
but
also
puts
the
person
on
notice
that
his
substantial
participation
in
the
fraud
will
give
rise
to
liability.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yeah,
we
think
there's...
yes.
we
think
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
avoid
summary
judgment,
that
the
case
has
been
sent
back
to
the
district
court
because
of
the
agreement
to
postpone
the
appraisal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
there
was
a
letter
agreement...
a
letter
from
the
authority
and
developer
endorsed
by
central
bank
to
put
off
the
appraisal
until
december
of
the
issuing
year,
so
it
was...
it
was
more
than
just--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
there
was
a
letter
dated
may
13th,
i
think,
of
1988.
the
other...
the
other
places
in
the
act
where
congress
has
identified
that
aiders
and
abettors
should
be
responsible
and
the
commission's
longstanding
ability
to
get
injunctions
against
aiders
and
abettors
under
section
21
also
reinforce
the
idea
that
aiders
and
abettors
are
responsible
and
therefore
set
the...
an
appropriate
parameter
for
the
private
right
of
action.
also,
the
statutory
analogues
that
this
court
has
looked
to,
particularly
sections
9
and
section
18
of
the
act,
far
from
supporting
petitioner's
position
support
respondent's
position
in
this
case.
section
9
imposes
liability
on
anyone
who
wilfully
participates,
and
participates
is
an
expansive
term,
in
fact
the
term
that
respondent
elsewhere
identifies
with
aiding
and
abetting
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
nye
and
nissen,
someone
who
participates
in
the
transaction,
so
section
9
we
think
is
clearly
broad
enough
to
include
aiding
and
abetting
liability,
and
the
same
with
section
18,
which
refers
to
any
person
who
makes
or
causes
to
be
made
any
misleading
statement
in
a
registration
statement.
and
finally,
the
private
right
of
action
for
aiding
and
abetting
is
a
very
important
supplement
to
the
sec's
own
enforcement
authority.
the
sec
can
go
after
aiders
and
abettors
just
as
it
can
go
after
primary
violators,
but
just
as
in
the
case
of
primary
violators,
the
sec
is
not
in
a
position
to
uncover
every
bit
of
wrongdoing
and
also
is
not
in
a
position
to
compensate
victims.
its
role
is
the
different
one
of
deterring
violations
by
disgorging
profits
or
enjoining
future
violations.
that's
why,
just
as
in
the
case
of
primary
violators,
the
private
right
of
action
is
important
in
the
case
of
aiders
and
abettors.
if
i
could
move
on
to
the
recklessness
standard,
in
terms
of
primary...
primary
violators,
it's
settled
in
all
the
courts
that
recklessness
is
an
adequate
showing
in
order
to
establish
liability.
that
was
also
true
at
common
law
fraud,
against
which
section
10(b)
should
be
read.
indeed,
in
this
court's
decision
in
cooper
v.
schlesinger,
the
court
said
a
statement
recklessly
made
without
knowledge
of
its
truth
is
a
false
statement
knowingly
made,
and
when
an
aider
and
abettor
substantially
participates
in
the
making
of
a
false
statement,
then
we
believe
that
the
same
standard
of
recklessness
that
applies
to
the
primary
violator
should
apply
to
the
aider
and
abettor,
because
after
all,
again,
the
aider
and
abettor
is
liable
in
the
criminal
law
as
a
principal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
knowledge
of
the
law
is
important.
i
think
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
transaction
that
the
primary
violator
is
engaged
in
is
important,
but
that
is...
that
is
obviously
true
here.
the
recklessness
in
this
case
comes
up
with
respect
to
recklessness
of...
with
respect
to
whether
the
information
was
true
or
false,
and
it...
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
because
he's
participating
in
the
perpetration
of
the
fraud,
and
again,
for
example--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and
in
theory
he
may
not
know
who
will
be
the
ultimate
principal.
that's
true.
my
only
point
is
that
the
aider
and
abettor
has
to
have
a
connection,
has
to
lend
substantial
assistance
to
a
primary--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
again,
a
reference
to
section
9
of
the
act
is
useful.
it
refers
to
someone
who
wilfully
participates,
and
as
this
case
held
last
term
in
hazen
paper,
wilfully--
