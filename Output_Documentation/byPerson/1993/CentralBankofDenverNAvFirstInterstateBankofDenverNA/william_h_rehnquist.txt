chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
92-854,
the
central
bank
of
denver
v.
the
first
interstate
bank
of
denver.
mr.
trautman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
that
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
requirement
that
it
be
done
in
concert
with
the
principal
actor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--could
the
substantial
assistance
required
by
the
other
circuits
be
rendered
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
it
is
substantial
assistance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
is
the
mr.
trautman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
trautman.
mr.
gersh,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
this--
--musick
is
arguably
quite
different
from
your
case
here,
in
that
given
the
primary
liability,
it
could
be
easily
argued
that
the
right
of
contribution
flowed
as
a
result
of
that.
i
don't
think
the
same
is
true
of
aider
and
abettor
liability.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
separate
inquiry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gersh.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
that
case
speak
about
the
necessary
intent
for
the
aider
and
abettor
of
agreement--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
the
position
of
the
sec
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
here
to
support
a
finding
that
the
petitioner
substantially
participated
in
the
circumstances
of
delaying
the
appraisal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
agree...
i
wasn't
aware
there
was
an
agreement.
i
thought
this
was
something
that
the
petitioner
did
on
its
own.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
there
was
an
agree--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
trautman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
trautman.
the
case
is
submitted.
