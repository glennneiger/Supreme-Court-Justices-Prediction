mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
two
central
issues
that
you
are
faced
with
today
are
whether
congress
intended
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action
for
aiding
and
abetting
under
10(b),
and
secondly,
if
you
so
conclude,
whether
or
not
recklessness
can
provide
a
sufficient
level
of
scienter,
even
though
there
is
no
duty
breached
either
to
disclose,
or
a
duty
of
action.
resolutions
of
these
issues
is
shaped
by
the
unique
features
of
this
case.
specifically,
central
bank
was
not
sued
as
a
primary
violator
who
allegedly
engaged
in
deceptive
or
manipulative
practices.
instead,
central
bank
was
accused
of
substantially
assisting
the
primary
violation
of
others
by
agreeing
to
delay
a
new
appraisal
until
after
bonds
were
issued,
thereby
allowing
the
fraud
to
occur.
central
bank
was
not
involved
in
selling
the
bonds
or
marketing
the
bonds,
but
instead
acted
as
indenture
trustee,
who
had
specific
duties
under
a
contractual
document
known
as
an
indenture
setting
out
the
duties
and
setting
out
the
bounds
of
its
discretion.
this
case
was
decided
originally
by
the
district
court
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
after
full
discovery,
and
at
that
time
it
was
undisputed
that
the
alleged
substantial
assistance
by
central
bank
involved
no
misrepresentation,
involved
no
violation
of
duty
of
action
or
duty
to
disclose
under
the
indenture,
and
in
fact
was
a
discretionary
act
under
the
indenture.
resolution
of
the
first
issue--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--the
act
that
they
claim
central
bank
engaged
in,
your
honor,
was
to
delay,
if
you
will,
an
appraisal
until
after
the
bonds
were
issued.
the
resolution
of
the
first
issue
on
private
right
of
action
in
our
view
turns
on
the
very
nature
of
what
aiding
and
abetting
is.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
sure.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
yes.
it
was
a
discretionary
act.
they
could
either
require
a
new
appraisal,
not
require
a
new
appraisal,
and
they
could
determine
the
timing
of
that
appraisal.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
well,
an
indenture
trustee
essentially
has
ministerial
acts,
carries
out
ministerial
acts.
some
courts
have
characterized
this
kind
of
trustee
as
a
stakeholder,
essentially
owing
duties
both
to
the
issuer
of
the
bonds
and
the
bondholder,
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
indenture
set
forth
what
the
duties
were
and
what
the
bounds
of
discretion
were.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
it
would
be...
i
don't
know
what
label
you
would
put
on
it,
but
it
would
be
an
act
that
the
trustee
could
decide
in
its
sound
discretion,
and
the
whole
purpose
of
doing
that--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
a
discretionary
matter.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that's
correct.
now,
let
me
focus
for
a
moment
on
what
aiding
and
abetting
is,
because
i
think
that
is
the
crux
of
the
problem
with
the
private
right
of
action.
aiding
and
abetting,
in
all
circuits
but
the
seventh
circuit,
does
not
require
a
plaintiff
to
show
a
manipulative
or
deceptive
practice.
what
it
requires
the
plaintiff
to
show
is
a
violation,
a
primary
violation
by
somebody
else,
and
substantial
assistance
of
that
violation
by
some
act
or
inaction,
and
finally,
a
level
of
scienter.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
the
courts
don't
seem
to
be
saying
that,
your
honor.
what
they--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--what
they--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--it
appears
that
that
is
the
case,
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what
has
happened
in
this
particular
case,
is
that
you
have
a
situation
where
a
professional,
a
bank
in
this
particular
case,
was
acting
pursuant
to
its
duties,
and
pursuant
to
its
discretion,
and
is
accused
here
in
taking
an
act
which
essentially
allowed
a
fraud
to
occur.
now,
if
i
may--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--that
appears
to
be
the
case,
your--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--that's
correct.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
we
agree,
your
honor,
because
the
aiding
and
abetting
act,
if
you
will,
is
not
necessarily
deceptive
or
manipulative.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
we
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
because
it
would
have
been
fruitless,
your
honor.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
the
tenth
circuit
had
found
in
1974,
without
any
analysis
whatsoever...
they
had
assumed
that
there
was
a
private
right
of
action,
and
we
think
that
those
cases,
your
honor,
essentially
are
premised
upon
a
methodology
that
this
court
has
now
abandoned.
that
is,
the
methodology
from
borak,
the
methodology
that
would
allow
courts
to
essentially
import
tort
principles
into
the...
into
the
act
without
an
analysis
as
to
whether
congress
really
intended
for
that
to
happen.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that's
correct.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
this
court
could
decide
the
issue
on
a
broad
basis,
which
would
be
to
say
that
the
words
of
10(b)
do
not
reach
aiding
and
abetting,
and
that
would
have
the
effect
of
covering
both
private
actions
and
sec
actions.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
could
find,
using
its
approach
announced
in
musick,
which
essentially
followed
the
approach
that
had
been
followed
for
years,
could
say
that
either
it
was
a
separate
cause
of
action,
and
we
all
know
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
a
cause
of
action
for
10(b)
and
therefore
they
did
not
intend
to
create
a
cause
of
action
for
aiding
and
abetting,
or
even
if
you
don't
find
it's
a
separate
cause
of
action
and
you
adopt
the
government's
view
that
this
is
merely
rounding
out
of
an
existing
cause
of
action,
you
look
to,
under
the
musick
case,
section
9
and
section
18,
those
sections
which
were
intended
to
be
a
measure,
if
you
will,
of
how
congress
would
have
dealt
with
the
issue,
and
you
find
that
they
are
silent
as
to
aiding
and
abetting,
and
we
think
that
that
is
significant
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
prior
to
1934,
as
early
as--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--no.
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
two
roads
that
the
court
could
take,
both
of
which
would
result
in
my
client
winning
the
case,
and
so
from
that
point
of
view
i
don't
particularly
mind
which
course
you
take.
if
you
take
the
broad
course,
i
think
that
that
would
have
the
effect,
and
that
broad
course
would
say
that
the
10(b)
was
just
never
intended
to
cover
any
aiding
and
abetting.
you
could
also
take
the
narrow
course,
which
would
be
to
merely
say
that
this
is
a
separate
cause
of
action,
private
cause
of
action,
and
therefore
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
that
private
cause
of
action
and
not
get
to
the
question
of
the
language
of
10(b),
so
i
think
that
there
is
a
way
for
you
to
avoid
the
damage.
i
might
also--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--that's
correct.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
that
is
correct.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
well,
i
suppose
there
could
have
been
any
allegation
at
the
onset.
what
they
chose
to
do
here,
your
honor,
was
to
not
sue
us
as
a
primary
violator,
but
instead
to
sue
us
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
in
our
view,
a
conspiracy
would
also
be
a
separate
cause
of
action.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
in
the
general
law
of
torts,
conspiracy
has
been
considered
as
part
of
the
underlying
tort,
but
here,
and
the
problem
we
have
with
aiding
and
abetting,
i
think
it's
the
same
problem
you
have
with
conspiracy,
is
what
the
courts
have
tended
to
do
is
just
to
assume
that
these
peripheral
rights
are
there
without
any
analysis
as
to
whether
congress
really
intended
them
to
be
there,
and
if,
in
fact,
the
key
is--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--that's
correct.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
well,
i
think
the
difference...
there
is
a
difference
between
aiding
and
abetting
and
conspiracy,
and
let
me
just
focus
on
that
for
a
moment.
as
you
know,
conspiracy
is
based
upon
an
agreement,
essentially
that
there
has
been
a
relationship
set
up
based
on
an
agreement.
what
aiding
and
abetting
is
really
premised
on
is
additional
conduct,
additional
conduct
that
the
courts
have
struggled
to
define
and
have
used
words
of
substantial
assistance
and
put
all
sorts
of
factors
in
front
of
that,
such
as,
was
the
defendant
benefited,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
it
has
become
a
morass,
as
you
look
at
the
cases,
as
to
what
substantial
assistance
means,
but
that
is
separate
conduct.
it
is
not
a
relationship,
such
as
a
conspiracy.
it
is
not,
as
this
court
said
in
musick,
an
allegation
of
existing
10(b)
liability,
because
it
is
additional
conduct
beyond
manipulation
or
deception.
if
the
fact--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--that's
correct,
but
there
is
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
actual...
you
see,
my
problem
with
what
the
lower
courts
have
done
is
that
they
have
focused
on
this
substantial
assistance
issue,
and
they've
lost
their
eye
on
the
ball,
and
the
ball
really
here
is,
did
my
client
engage
in
deceptive
or
manipulative
conduct,
and
if
they
did,
they
could
be
sued
as
a
primary
violator.
it
so
happens
that
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
it's
clear
or
undisputed,
that
we
did
not
do
anything
that
this
court
has
defined
previously
as
being
deceptive
or
manipulative,
and
so
what
you
have
out
there
essentially
that's
been
applied...
implied
by
the
courts
is
a
cause
of
action
which
allows
a
plaintiff
to
come
in
and
sue
a
defendant
because
the
defendant
was
around
the
transaction,
was
there,
has
deep
pockets,
and
essentially
to
make
allegations
that
they
have
benefited
from
the
transaction,
that
they
caused...
they
helped
cause
the
transaction,
if
they
had
just
acted
differently,
this
fraud
wouldn't
have
occurred,
but
they
did
not
engage
in
any
deceptive
or
manipulative
conduct.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
well,
the
reason
why
you
can't
say
that,
your
honor,
is
because
manipulative
practice
has
really
focused
on
two
concepts.
one
is
misrepresentation,
and
second
is
either
a
failure
to
act
or
failure
to
disclose
in
a
context
where
you
have
a
duty
to
do
so.
neither
of
those
two
things
are
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
well--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--your
honor,
obviously
that
is
not
presented
here.
we
think
that
a
conspiracy
is
different
than
aiding
and
abetting.
it
does
have
the
same
dangers--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--i
don't
believe
that
there...
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ruled
as
such.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
no,
i
don't.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
exactly.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
and
my
point
is,
though,
that
you
don't
need
to
reach
that,
and
in
trying
to
respond
to
justice
kennedy,
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
distinction.
in
the
curran
case
this
court,
in
a
very...
a
very
quick
passage,
without,
it
appeared,
much
discussion,
said
that...
i
think
it
was
under
the
commodities
act,
that
there
could
be...
conspirators
could
be
held
liable,
but
if
you
look
at
that
case,
that
those
so-called
"coconspirators"
were
really
primarily
liable
in
our
view,
under
the
facts
of
the
commodities
case.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
there
has
to
be
just
a
duty
to
disclose.
i'm
saying
there
either
has
to
be
misrepresentation
or
a
duty
to
disclose,
neither
of
which
were
present
here,
and
with
respect
to
the
duty
to
disclosure,
i
think
this
court's
cases
in
chiarella
and
dirks
essentially
stand
for
that
proposition,
among
others.
if
i
could
focus
for
a
moment
on
the...
what
i
think
is
the
unavoidable
legislative
determination
here
is
that
prior
to
1934
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
law,
the
court
essentially
knew
how
to
create
criminal
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
they
used
very
specific
language.
after
1934,
in
a
whole
series
of
amendments,
in
1964,
'75,
'86,
and
1990,
they
also
knew
how
to
create
liability
for
sec
disciplinary
action.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
this
is
the
congress.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
i
apologize.
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
the...
and
by
contrast
here,
in
1934,
in
the
act
itself,
in
section
10(b)
there
is
no
mention
of
aiding
and
abetting,
and
we
believe
that
that
is
very
strong
evidence
that
both
before
and
after
1934,
they
used
very
specific
language
when
they
wished
to
create
such
a
right,
that
in
the
act
in
1934
it
is
silent,
and
also,
if
you
use
the
measure,
if
you
will,
of--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
maybe
three
levels
to
go
with
this.
i
said
there
were
two.
the
first
level
is
to
find
that
there
is
a
separate
cause
of
action,
and
at
that
point
in
time,
you
can
then
very
quickly
conclude
that
congress
intended
no
such
cause
of
action.
the
second
level
is
to
say
that
it
is
rounding
out,
but
the
first
thing
we're
going
to
do
is
to
look
at
whether
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action,
using
section
9
and
18
as
models,
and
if
you
do
that,
you
can
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there's
no
private
right
of
action.
you
don't
have
to
get
into
the
broader
issue
even
in
that
second
realm
of
looking
at
whether
or
not
it
exceeds,
if
you
will...
whether
the
conduct
exceeds
what
is
permitted
by
section
10(b).
the
third
is
the
broader
one,
and
that
would
be
to
say
that
we
look
at
the
language,
we
knew
what
we
said
in
ernst
and
ernst,
and
that
is
manipulation
and
deception
means
manipulation
and
deception,
it
doesn't
mean
something
else
such
as
substantial
assistance
of
manipulation
and
deception.
that
is
the
broader
ruling,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
one
would
take
care
of
the
sec.
however,
let
me
just
mention,
there
is
some
implication
here
that
the
sec
is
going
to
be
left
powerless
if
in
fact
you
take
that
broad
ruling,
and
i
think
that
that
is
incorrect.
yes,
congress
after
all
has
given
the
sec
aiding
and
abetting
authority
in
section
15
with
regard
to
these
disciplinary
proceedings.
and
also
in
1990,
in
a
recent
amendment,
they...
they
held
that
the
sec...
this
is
the
congress
again,
mr.
chief
justice...
held
that
the
sec
had
cease
and
desist
authority
against
any
person
who
is
violating,
has
violated,
or
is
about
to
violate
any
provision
of
the
statute,
or
any
other
person
that
is,
was,
or
would
be
a
cause
of
the
violation
due
to
an
act
or
omission
such
other
person
knew
or
should
have
known
would
contribute
to
such
violation.
the
point
being,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
sec
still
does
have
enforcement
authority
both
in
section
15
as
well
as
this
section,
which
is
21(c),
added
in
1990.
the
second
point
that
i
think
that
this
brings
out
is
that
congress
knew
again
how
to
create
liability
beyond
just
the
direct
liability
that
is
set
forth
in
the
statute.
they
used
aiding
and
abetting
language
in
the
sec
disciplinary
proceedings,
and
they
used
contribution
language
in
this
particular
case.
let
me
just
spend
a
moment,
if
i
may,
on
the
second
issue
which
hopefully
you
will
not
have
to
reach,
and
that
is
the
issue
of
what
is
the
proper
scienter
standard
if,
in
fact,
there
is
such
an
aiding
and
abetting
right.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
that
question
obviously
is
not
raised
here,
does
not
have
to
be
decided,
but
if
in
fact--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--if
in
fact...
if
in
fact
that
question
were
presented,
we
think
that
the
proper
approach
would
be
to
look
at
the
words
of
10(b)
and
to
say
that
you
cannot
have
a
reckless
manipulation,
you
cannot
have
a
reckless
device,
so
i
don't
think
it
should.
however,
there
may
be
cases
that
come
before
this
court
where
the
court
would--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--yes.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
yes,
they
have.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
they
have.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
yes.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
they
all
have,
your
honor.
i
think
the
point
being
that
if
you
decide,
however,
that
recklessness
were
sufficient
for
aiding
and
abetting,
i
think
almost
by
necessity
everybody
will
assume
that
it's
good
enough
for
a
primary
violation
even
though
you
may
try
to
reserve
the
question.
by
contrast,
there
is
a
principal
basis--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--exactly.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
okay,
and
the
reason
why
there
shouldn't
be
enough
if
it's
aiding
and
abetting
would
be
to
recognize
that...
if
you
find
that
there
is
a
separate
cause
of
action
for
aiding
and
abetting,
or
that
there
is
an
additional
cause
of
action
implied
by
congress
for
aiding
and
abetting,
the
principal
difference
being
that
that
is
one
step
removed
from
a
primary
violation
and
yet
carries
with
it
joint
and
several
liability,
and
so
there
is
a
logical
basis
for
saying
that
in
that
circumstance
we're
going
to
require
a
higher
degree
of
knowledge
or
scienter
than
we
are
in
the
primary
violation.
also,
the
other
basis
would
be
to
recognize,
ask
as
this
court
did
in
the
criminal
law
context
in
nye
and
nissen
that
aiding
and
abetting,
as
justice
learned...
judge
learned
hand
at
that
point
in
time
said,
"in
some
sort
you
must
associate
yourself
with
a
venture
that
he
participated
as
is
something
he
wishes
to
bring
about,
that
he
seek
by
his
action
to
make
it
succeed,
and
it
would
be
true
and
consistent
with
what
i
think
the
origins
of
aiding
and
abetting
really
were,
that
there
has
to
be
purposeful,
conscious
conduct
to
further
what
was
going
on.
"
the
most
difficult
problem
that
you
have
with
recklessness,
in
my
view,
i
think
is
pointed
out
by
the
sec's
brief,
where
in
the
same
breath
they
say
that
the
standard
is
both
a
flexible
and
predictable
standard,
and
i
think
we
would
agree
with
the
first
part
that
it
is
flexible.
it
is
so
flexible,
however,
that
the
only
prediction
that
we
can
give
our
clients
is
that
every
case
will
be
decided
on
its
facts.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
exactly.
[laughter]
the
difficulty
created
for
professionals
in
complex
litigation
such
as
this
one,
complex
securities
transactions
where
you
have
underwriters,
appraisers,
accountants,
bond
and
disclosure
counsel
and
trustee,
all
of
whom
have
specific
duties
and
expertise,
and
to
a
large
extent
all
of
whom
rely
on
the
others
to
carry
out
their
particular
roles,
those
differences,
however,
are
overridden
by
a
common
trait
in
these
transactions.
they
all
assist.
by
definition,
they
all
assist,
and
therefore
they
are
potential
targets
for
aiding
and
abetting
if
their
actions
or
inactions
allowed
the
fraud
to
occur,
and
as
this...
i
think
it's
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
indicates,
oftentimes
the
difference
between
action
and
inaction
is
found
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder.
did
central
bank
take
affirmative
action
by
delaying
the
appraisal
until
after
the
bonds
were
issued,
or
by
contrast,
did
central
bank
fail
to
have
a
new
appraisal
done
before
the
bonds
were
issued,
and
we
think
that
a
determination
of
liability
on
such
characterizations
would
not
be
appropriate.
recklessness
is
too
much--
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
no,
the
$2
million
of
collateral,
your
honor,
related
to
an
earlier
bond
issue.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
inevitably
in
these
transactions
problems
are
going
to
come
up
and
problems
have
to
be
resolved,
and
i
think
your
honor's
point
is
well
taken,
is
that
there
is
certainly
give-and-take
with
respect
to
these.
it's
not
as
if
central
bank
was
essentially
lining
its
pockets.
it
was
looking
for...
looking
out
for
the
interest
of
the
'86
bondholders.
let
me
just
focus
my
last
comments
before
sitting
down
on
what
i
think
the
fundamental
problem
with
recklessness
is,
and
that
is,
it
is
too
much
like
negligence,
which
this
court
has
already
found
in
ernst
&
ernst
is
not
a
sufficient
level
of
scienter
for
10(b).
both
negligence
and
recklessness
involve
a
deviation
from
a
standard
of
care.
to
that
extent,
they're
identical.
the
only
difference
between
the
two,
however,
is
that
recklessness
requires
an
extreme
departure
from
that
standard
of
care,
and
in
our
view
that's
a
very
slippery
standard
which
will
prevent
summary
judgment
from
being
granted
for
wrongfully
accused
defendants,
and
it
will
allow
liability
based
upon
a
jury's
view
of
the
extremity
of
the
defendant's
conduct.
it
will
also
allow
judges
and
juries
to,
in
essence,
create
a
federal
standard
of
conduct
after
the
fact
which,
as
this
court...
as
this
case
demonstrates
can
be
contrary
to
the
state
law
duties
of
the
particular
defendant.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
it
defined
it...
it
essentially
used
the
sundstrand
approach,
which
was
that
it
had
to
be
an
extreme
departure
from
a
standard
of
care.
that
was
the
definition
that
they
used,
your
honor.
and
so
what
we're
left
with
is
scienter
being
the
only
reliable
screen
that
this
court
has
to
sort
out
conduct
that
is
truly
the
use
of
a
manipulative
or
deceptive
device
or
contrivance
from
other
conduct
believed
by
plaintiffs
to
be
unfair,
and
as
we
indicate,
we
believe
that
in
the
case
of
aiding
and
abetting,
because
it
is
one
step
removed
from
primary
liability,
that
the
better
approach
is
to
use
conscious
intent.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
tucker
karl
trautman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gersh's
concession
that
he
could
not
have
brought
an
action
against
my
client
for
a
primary
violation
speaks
volumes
as
to
whether
or
not
my
client
engaged
in
manipulative
or
deceptive
conduct
which
is
the
keystone
of
section
10(b).
however,
i
don't
want
the
court
to
get
the
impression
that
professionals
could
never
be
sued
under
a
primary
violation.
i
think
clearly
they
could,
but
they
would
have
to
essentially
have
participated
in
and
engaged
in
deceptive
conduct,
something
that
did
not
happen
here.
i
think
as
justice
scalia
indicated,
the
allegation
against
our
client
is
not
that
we
participated
in
a
misrepresentation,
because
we
didn't.
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
selling
process.
what
we
are
accused
of
doing
is
essentially
by
our
conduct
allowing
the
fraud
to
occur.
the
government
argues
that
the
common
law
was
so
well-established
at
the
time
the
congress
passed
10(b)
that
it
must
have
presumed
to
have
incorporated
it,
and
we
think
that
this
court's
decisions
in
blue
chip,
ernst
&
ernst,
and
santa
fe
minerals,
essentially
made
clear
that
there
is
not
an
automatic
implementation
of
those
principles
into
the
law,
but
instead,
that
there
has
to
be
some
demonstrated
showing
that
congress
intended
to
do
so.
the
common
law...
or,
strike
that.
the
securities
act
was
not
intended
to
be
a
panacea
for
all
evils
under
the
securities
laws,
and
i
think
those
decisions
indicate
it.
finally,
let
me
just
comment
that,
interestingly
enough,
the
very
source
of
the
recklessness
standard...
that
is,
section
876
of
the
restatement
of
torts,
which
talks
about
substantially
assisting,
in
that
standard,
recklessness
is
not
enough.
you
have
to
have
knowledge,
under
the
tort
law,
for
substantial
assistance,
whereas
here,
what
our
opponents
are
asking
you
to
do
is
to
graft
on
a
principle
in
the
deceit
context
onto
substantial
assistance,
which
even
the
tort
law
doesn't
do.
thank
you
very
much.
