justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
taken
in
the
light
most
favorably
to
the
plaintiff,
could
there
have
been
a
cause
of
action
or
an
allegation
for
liability
as
co...
of
the
bank
as
coconspirator?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
they
alleged
that
there
was
an
agreement
to
hold
up
the
appraisal,
and
then
alleged
that
this
was
a
conspiracy,
would
that
be
a
separate
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
it
been
treated
as
such
in
the
writings,
in
the
general
law
of
torts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
a
sense...
in
a
sense,
conspiracy
requires
an
element
that
aiding
and
abetting
doesn't,
namely,
an
agreement,
so
in
a
sense,
an
aider
and
abettor
is
acting
closer
to
the
principal
actor
than
is
a
conspirator.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
secondary
liability.
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice.
in
musick
we
did
not
expand
the
universe
of
persons
who
had
a
duty
to
the
purchaser
of
the
securities.
here,
we
would
be
doing
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
musick,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
musick,
the
premise
was
that
there
was
a
duty
under
the
securities
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
law
of
torts
generally,
i
can't
off-hand...
maybe
you
can
help
me...
think
of
an
example
where
an
aider
and
abettor
is
not
liable
for
the
commission
of
a
tort.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
the
aider
and
abettor
at
least
have
to
know
that
the
primary
participant
has
a
duty
under
the
securities
laws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-854,
central
bank
of
denver
versus
first
interstate
bank
of
denver
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
opinion
in
central
bank
of
denver
versus
first
interstate
bank
of
denver.
the
case
presents
an
issue
we
have
twice
read
before
and
we
reach
it
now.
the
issue
is
whether
in
a
suit
based
on
section
10(b)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934,
a
plaintiffs
may
sue
and
recover
damages
from
a
party
alleged
to
have
done
no
more
than
aid
and
abet
the
violation
of
securities
laws.
the
complaint
in
this
case
alleged
a
securities
fraud
in
the
issuance
of
bonds
to
finance
public
improvements
for
a
plan
residential
community
in
colorado.
the
allegation
was
that
the
bonds
were
issued
in
reliance
on
an
appraisal
that
reflected
earlier
land
values
that
should
have
been
readjusted
to
take
account
of
a
declining
real
estate
market.
the
petitioner,
central
bank
of
denver,
served
as
the
indenture
trustee
for
the
bond
issue.
according
to
the
complaint,
central
bank
did
not
itself
commit
a
violation
to
securities
act
but
it
did
aid
and
abet
of
violation
by
agreeing
to
postpone
an
independent
review
of
the
land
valuation.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
central
bank
but
the
tenth
circuit
disagreed.
consistent
with
the
tenth
circuit's
precedents,
the
court
stated
that
the
private
plaintiffs
may
sue
and
recover
damages
from
a
party
who
aids
and
abets
the
violation
of
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
act,
and
the
court
further
held
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
create
a
triable
issue
of
fact
on
the
question
whether
central
bank
had
aided
and
abetted
the
violation.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
sue
for
aiding
and
abetting
a
10(b)
violation
is
not
available
under
the
federal
securities
laws.
our
case
is
considering
the
scope
of
conduct
prohibited
by
section
10(b)
have
emphasized
adherence
to
the
statutory
language
and
we
have
refused
to
allow
challenges
to
conduct
not
prohibited
by
the
text
of
the
statute.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
settled
methodology
in
section
10(b)
cases
to
extend
liability
to
aiding
and
abetting.
the
statue
does
not
include
giving
aid
to
a
person
who
commits
a
manipulative
or
deceptive
act.
we
cannot
immune
the
statute
to
create
liability
for
acts
that
are
not
themselves
manipulative
or
deceptive
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
respondents
make
a
number
of
non-textual
arguments
for
the
imposition
of
aiding
and
abetting
liability
under
section
10(b)
but
none
of
which
leads
us
to
a
different
answer.
we
cannot
assume,
as
respondents
urged,
that
congress
implicitly
intended
to
impose
aiding
and
abetting
liability
in
the
securities
act
of
1934.
congress
imposed
some
forms
of
secondary
liability
in
the
1934
act
but
did
not
include
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
that
indicates
the
congressional
choice
with
which
the
courts
should
not
interfere.
respondents
also
point
that
post
1934
legislative
developments
to
support
the
various
post-1934
congresses
have
acquiesced
in
the
aiding
and
abetting
cause
of
action
recognized
by
some
federal
courts.
but,
as
we
have
held
before,
congress'
failure
to
overturn
statutory
decisions
reached
by
the
federal
courts
is
not
itself
a
reason
to
adhere
to
those
decisions.
congressional
inaction
cannot
amend
a
duly
enacted
statute.
in
this
case,
the
securities
and
exchange
act
passed
by
congress
in
1934.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
also
makes
various
policy
arguments
in
support
of
aiding
and
abetting
liability
under
section
10(b),
but
those
arguments
do
not
show
that
adherence
to
the
statutory
text
would
lead
to
a
result
congress
would
not
have
intended.
we
note,
indeed,
that
there
are
many
policy
arguments
against
the
imposition
of
aiding
and
abetting
liability
under
section
10(b).
we
hold
that
a
private
plaintiff
may
not
maintain
an
aiding
and
abetting
suit
under
section
10(b).
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
blackmun,
justice
souter,
and
justice
ginsburg.
