justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
trautman,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
really
is
a
quite
separate
offense
from
the
fraud
itself,
however.
is
it
not
the
case
that
you
can
be
convicted
of
aiding
and
abetting
an
offense
even
though
the
person
who
has
been
accused
of
committing
the
offense
itself
is
acquitted?
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
with
contribution,
of
course,
you
can't
be
compelled
to
contribute
unless
the
principal
has
been
held
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
to
separate
it
from
the...
you
know,
the
kind
of
inevitable
accompaniments
of
private
rights
of
action
that
we've
found
in
the
past
in
musick,
for
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
to
say,
it
is
not
the
private
cause
of
action
that
we
have
heretofore
recognized.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we're
not
going
to
recognize
any
other
private
causes
of
action
under
10(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
acknowledge
that
this
horrible
thing
which
you
just
described
could
happen
if
your
client
was
sued
for
conspiracy
to
violate
10(b)?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
cause
of
action
for
conspiracy
to
violate
10(b)?
would
that
exist?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it's
different,
but
will
you
first
answer
my
question?
do
you
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
for
conspiracy
to
violate
10(b)?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
there
should
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
same
reason
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
for
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
now
making
the
broader
argument
in...
under
justice
ginsburg's
question,
so
if
we
agree
with
you
on
this
argument,
even
the
sec
could
not
enforce
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
predictably
flexible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
certainly,
but
it's
not
really
joint
tortfeasor
liability
because
you
can
find
one
guilty
and
the
other
not
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
wherein
this
differs
a
whole
lot
from
contribution.
you
can
find
someone
guilty
of
aiding
and
abetting
an
offense
even
though
the
alleged
primary
offender
is
acquitted.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
get
the
jury
who's
trying
the
aider
and
abettor
to
find
that
there
was
a
primary
violation,
but
another
jury
could
have
found
that
the
primary
violator
in
fact
didn't
do
it,
and
it
would
not
eliminate
the
aiding
and
abetting
liability,
whereas
with
contribution,
if
the
primary
offender
is
not
found
liable,
there's
no
question
that
there
can't
be
any
contribution.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gersh--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
a
different
question.
i
mean,
rounding
out
is
quite
different
from
asking
yourself,
would
the
congress
that
created
a
private
right
of
action
under
10(b)
of
the
sort
we've
already
recognized
also
create
a
private
cause
of
action
for
this?
the
answer
to
the
latter
question
is,
god,
a
congress
that
would
do
it
for
that
would
do
it
for
all
sorts
of
violations
of
the
security
act,
and
that's
quite
different
from
rounding
out.
rounding
out
is
to
say,
we've
already
held
that
congress
has
created
this,
but
whether
they
really
did
or
not
doesn't
matter.
we've
held
that.
this
is
such
an
inherent
part
of
that
that
we
can't
possibly
withhold
acknowledgement
of
that
as
well.
you're
inviting
us
to
adopt
a
quite
different
test,
to
say,
would
the
congress
that
created
the
private
right
of
action
we've
already
acknowledged
create
another
private
right
of
action?
well...
well,
i
think
they'd
create
right
of
actions
all
over
the
place
if
they
accepted
the
one
we've
already
found.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
well
for
the
principal
offense,
but
does
it
for
the
allied
offense
of
aiding
and
abetting?
does
it
for
conspiracy,
for
example?
can
you
become
a
coconspirator
by
being
reckless?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am.
i'm
certain
you
cannot
become
a
coconspirator
by
being
very
reckless.
you
have
to
have
an
agreement,
the
intent
to
make
alliance
with
the
other
person,
and
isn't
it
the
same
for
aiding
and
abetting?
you
need
the
intent
to
aid
and
abet.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
are
those
cases
in
your
brief?
do
you
recall?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
go
on.
i
don't
want
to
make
you
waste
your
time.
you
have
little
left.
i'll
find
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
yes,
but
most
of
those
cases...
as
far
as
the
text
shows,
all
of
those
cases
involve
the
tort
of
deceit,
includes
reckless
behavior.
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
does,
but
does
aiding
and
abetting
deceit
include
just
being
reckless?
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
want
to
aid
and
abet.
you
have
to
want
to
assist.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
that
recklessly,
any
more
than
you
can
conspire
recklessly.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
think
congress
when
it
enacted
section
2
of
title
18,
which
applies
to
the
whole
criminal
code,
really
had
this
narrow
problem
in
mind
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
can
make
the
opposite
argument
from
article
2,
and
that
is
that
if
it
was
a
rounding
out
matter,
you
wouldn't
even
have
to
have
section
2,
that
it
would
automatically
go
along.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
felt
the
need
to
say,
by
the
way,
aiders
and
abettors
will
be
held
the
same
as
principals.
justice
antonin
scalia
anyone
who
recklessly
creates
the
conditions
that
enables
someone
else
to
perpetrate
a
fraud
becomes
an
aider
and
abettor
of
the
fraud?
