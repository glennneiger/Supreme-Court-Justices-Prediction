justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
some
of
that
information
that
they
knew
about
had
no
relationship
to
matters
of
public
concern?
like
a
statement
that
one
of
the
nurses
was
ruining
the
hospital,
and
i
forget,
there
are
two
or
three
things
that
arguably
raise
questions
that
might...
might
have
some
public
interest
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
described
the
impact
by
describing
what
one
of
the
witnesses
said
was
going
to
happen
to
personnel,
but
there's
no
evidence
that
that
really
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
isn't
any
evidence
that
they
had
any
staffing
problems,
was
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the...
there
was
something
independent
of
the
speech.
i
can't
remember
what
it
was.
but
wasn't
it
true
that
the
thought
was
even
if
the
bad...
the
protected
speech
had
not
been
made,
that
she
would
have
been
fired
anyway?
isn't
that
right,
that
was
the
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
did
have
a
bad
personnel
record.
here
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
she
was
fired
because
she
made
a
particular
group
of
statements
on
a
particular
date,
which
they
didn't
realize
were
protected
is
the
defense.
but
she
was
clearly
fired
because
she
made
a
particular
speech
which
they
say
was
protected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
speech
is
the...
is...
was
the
basis
for
the
discharge.
