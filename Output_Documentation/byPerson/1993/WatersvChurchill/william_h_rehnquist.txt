we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
92-1450,
cynthia
waters
v.
cheryl
churchill.
mr.
manson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
manson.
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr
seamon.
mr.
bisbee,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bisbee,
to
further
justice
ginsburg,
when
they're
summarizing
at
the
end
of
their
opinion,
they
say
we
further
hold
as
immaterial
whether
the
defendants
knew
the
precise
content
of
churchill's
conversation,
for
they
knew
or
should
have
known.
this
is
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we...
we
granted
certiorari
on
a
question
presented,
and
you
can
assume
that
we
want
to...
we
want
to
hear
argument
on
that
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
may
be
a
justification
for
employee
free
speech,
but
under
the
balancing
test
certainly
some
of
what
justice
scalia
says
is
relevant.
to
whom
the
speech
is
addressed
was...
could
this
person
do
anything
about
it,
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
are
arguments
perhaps
as
to
what
the
motive
of
the
hospital
was.
i
don't
think
they
address
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case
is...
when
we
take
it
here...
is
a
question
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
if
the
employer
discharges
for
speech
without
knowledge
that
it's
protected
speech,
is
that
a
violation...
does
that
come
under
mount
healthy
as
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
all
the
facts
you
bring
up
i
don't
think
really
address
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you've
made
that
point
for
25
minutes.
are
you
going
to
address
the
question
of
law
that's
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bisbee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
manson,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
