bader

mr.
manson,
do
you
mean
no
evidence
on
the
record
as
it
now
stands?
assuming
that
you
prevail
on
the
question
you're
now
arguing,
it
doesn't
follow
that
you
get
summary
judgment,
do
you?
because
isn't...
wouldn't
it
be
open
to
the
plaintiff
then
to
show
that,
indeed,
the
relevant
offices
did
know
that
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
be
construed,
but
not
had
to
be
construed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
doesn't
she
have
her
own
evidence
of
what
she
said,
and
wasn't
there
anyone
else?
was
it
only
those
two
people?
and
weren't
there
preceding
events
from
which
one
might
infer
that
that
speech
concerned...
was
a
matter...
on
a
matter
of
public
concern?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
say
there's
no
credibility
issue
at
all
involved
in
that,
that
it's
open
and
shut,
that
all
that
the
defendants
knew
about
was
that
she
was
grousing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
it
come
out
later
that
those
reports
were
inaccurate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
did
it...
how
did
it...
what
was
the
basis
on
which
the
employer
learned
more
later?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
thought
you
were.
i
thought
that
the...
that
you
were
relying
on
statements
that
what
was
said
was
grousing,
and
what
was
said
was
not
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
that's
different
from
taking
the
same
speech
and
saying
what
was
the
motive
for
it,
or
what
was
the
effect
of
it.
we're
looking
at,
as
i
understand
it,
two
separate
versions
of
what
happened.
one
person
said
i
heard
grousing
and
the
other
person
is
saying
i
spoke
about
matters
of
public
concern.
i
thought
that's
what
was
the
nature
of
your
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and--
--but
isn't
this
case
different
from
mount
healthy
in
that
the
question
is
what
was
the
speech?
now,
whether
the
person
was
fired
for
what
was
the
speech,
or
was
fired
for
a
different
reason,
is
a
different
question
from
what
was
the
speech?
here
the
employer
thinks
the
speech
is
one
thing
when
the
employer
acts,
but
it
turns
out
to
be
something
else.
i
thought
that's
what
this
case
was,
and
that...
that
such
a
case
has
not
been
seen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
the
employer
was
right
about
what
the
speech
was,
there
wouldn't
be
any
first
amendment
argument
to
make.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
only
because
the
employer
thought
the
words
were
one
thing,
when,
in
fact,
it
appears
they
may
have
been
something
quite
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
had
a
question
that
i
think
you
could
be
very
helpful
with.
if
you
had
a
situation
like
this
in
federal
employment,
how
would
the
employee
put
forward
that
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
take
a
nonprobationary
employee.
apart
from
the
administrative
process,
would
there
be
any
judicial
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
come
directly
to
court,
skip
over
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
any
of
these
matters
go
through
a
collectively
bargained
arrangement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bisbee,
i
wish
you
would
turn
to
the
question
presented,
which
is
that
the
understanding
of
the
employer
at
the
time
of
the
action.
the
employer's
understanding,
according
to
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition,
was
that
the...
there
was...
the
speech
that
was
involved
was
unprotected
insubordinate
speech.
so
the
question
is
at
that
time,
the
time
of
the
firing,
the
employer
believes
that
the
words
spoken
were
unprotected,
insubordinate
speech;
doesn't
find
out
until
later
the
first
amendment
protected
cat...
that's
the
question
presented.
who
phrased
that
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
that
what
the
question...
isn't
that
what
the
seventh
circuit
treated
the
question
as
being?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
question
did
the
seventh
circuit
address?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
seventh
circuit
said
it
didn't
matter
that
the
employer
didn't
know
that
the
words
spoken
were
protected
speech.
didn't
the
seventh
circuit
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
more
than
said
we
held...
it
said
we
hold
that
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
the
employee's
speech
is
inadequate
to
insulate
officials
from
the
1983
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bisbee,
do
i
take
it
that
what
you're
saying
is
you
had
a
triable
case
on
what
that
employer
understood
at
the
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right,
but
so
that's
quite--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--different
from
the...
that
was
the
question
that
i
was
asking
your
adversary.
even
if
the
seventh
circuit
is
wrong
that...
and
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
employee
believed
the
speech
was
unprotected
at
the
time
the
employer
acted,
would
the
summary
judgment
be
appropriate.
and
he
said
you
didn't
come
forward
with
anything
to
show
that
the
employer
understood,
at
the
time
it
was
acting,
that
it
was
dealing
with
protected
speech.
but
what
did
you
come
forward
with
at
the
time
of
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
to
make
out
a
case
that
at
the
time
this
woman
was
fired,
the
people
who
fired
her
knew
that
she
was
dealing
in
protected
speech?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bisbee--
--does...
yes.
--the
seventh
circuit
may
have
had
the
wrong
fix
on
the
case,
but
it
did
say
twice
that
its
holding
is
if
the
employer
is
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
speech,
it
doesn't
matter,
that's
not
insulating.
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me,
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
how
that
can
be
squared
with
a
qualified
immunity,
with
the
very
reason
for
being
of
a
qualified
immunity
doctrine?
if
a
person
acts
on
the
basis
of
credible
but
ultimately,
it
turns
out,
wrong
information,
how
can
such
a
person
not
have
qualified
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's...
unfortunately
that's
the
question
that
cert
was
granted
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
terminates
an
employee
based
on
credible
substantiated
reports
of
unprotected--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--at
the
time...
at
the
time
they
acted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
isn't...
then
isn't
the
bottom
line
of
your
argument
that
we
must
remand
to
the
seventh
circuit,
because
they
said
it
doesn't
matter
that
they
didn't
know
when
they
acted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we...
wouldn't
we
have
to
say,
seventh
circuit,
it
does
matter
that
they
knew
when
they
acted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bisbee--
--mr.--
--do
you
know
how
the
seventh
circuit
got
this
notion
that
what
they
were
dealing
with
was
an
employer
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
employee's
speech?
and
how
did...
how
did...
since
you
say
that
that's
not
what
this
case
is
about,
how
did
they
manage
to
think
that
that...
that
that
was
before
them,
that
you
can
impute
to
the
employer
what
comes
up
after,
even
if
you
accept
that
at
the
time
the
employer
acted
it
was
ignorant
of
what
the
content
of
the
speech
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
asking
you
where
did
the
seventh
circuit
get
that
notion
from,
that
it
put
it
in
its
opinion
a
couple
of
times?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
never
made...
you
never
made
such
an
argument,
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
they
knew
when
they
acted,
it
only
matters
what
the...
after
the
firing
comes
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
did
raise...
you
did
so
argue
in
your
brief
in
opposition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
did
so
argue
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
model
would
apply
across
the
board
as
far
as
the
city
is
concerned?
that's
also
a
foggy
question...
where
there's
a
difference
between
the
standard
for
damages
and
the
standard
for
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah,
because
you're
suing
the
individuals
who
wouldn't
have
the
authority
to
reinstate
her.
it
would
have
to
be
the
municipal
unit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you...
by
the
way,
did
you
ask
for
reinstatement
relief
or
just
money?
