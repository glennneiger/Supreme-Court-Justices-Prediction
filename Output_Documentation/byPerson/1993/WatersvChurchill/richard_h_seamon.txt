mr.
richard
h.
seamon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
supports
petitioners
on
both
the
first
amendment
issue
and
the
qualified
immunity
issue
in
this
case.
on
the
first
amendment
issue,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
when
it
held
that
it
is
irrelevant
whether
the
petitioners
knew,
at
the
time
of
nurse
churchill's
discharge,
that
she
had
engaged
in
protected
speech,
i.e.
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
that
holding
is
wrong
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
mount
healthy,
an
employee
must
show
both
that
she
engaged
in
protected
speech
and
that
she
was
fired
because
of
the
fact
that
she
engaged
in
protected
speech.
if
the
hospital
did
not
know
that
she
had
engaged
in
protected
speech,
it
could
not
have
been
motivated
by
that
fact.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
mount
healthy
was
most
accurately
characterized
as
a
mixed-motive
case.
and
we
think
it's
correct
to
say
that
the
court
has
never
directly
addressed
the
question
presented
here,
whether
motive
is
an
across-the-board
requirement
in
retaliatory
discharge
cases.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well...
and
it's
exactly
in
this
respect
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong.
we
think
that
motive
is
highly
relevant.
in
fact,
that
it's
a
necessary
element.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
think--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--motive
clearly
is
relevant,
and
mount
healthy
establishes
that
much.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
and
that...
that
was
the
focus
of
the
court's
concern
in
mount
healthy,
and
that
gave
rise
to
the
sort
of
two-part
showing
that
has
to
be
made
and
the
affirmative
defense
that's
available
to
the
employer.
but
what--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
and
i
think...
i
think
that's
exactly
correct,
to
say
that
mount
healthy...
the
assumption
in
mount
healthy
is
that
motive
is
relevant
and,
in
fact,
that
it's
an
element
of
the
plaintiff's
proof.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
may
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
she
was
fired
based
on
the
reports
of
what
she
had
said.
and
in
that
sense,
the
speech
formed
the
basis.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
the
employer
made
a
mistake
of
fact
about
the
content
of
the
speech.
and
the
question
is--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right,
if
the--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--exactly.
and
that
particular
fact
situation
wasn't
before
the
court
in
mount
healthy,
but
we
believe
that
justice
scalia's
correct
to
characterize
mount
healthy
as
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
motive
is
not
only
relevant,
but
that
it's
a
necessary
element
of
the
plaintiff's
burden
of
proof.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
situation
in
federal
employment
is
generally
that
whether
the
employee
is
a
probationary
employee
or
a
nonprobationary
employee,
she
would
have
the
opportunity
to
get
notice
of
the
reason
why
she
was
being
discharged,
and
in
certain
circumstances
an
opportunity
to
respond.
the
procedural
safeguards
are
somewhat
more
attenuated
for
a
probationary
employee,
but
certainly
for--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes.
the
employee
would
first
go
to
the
agency
and
then
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
and
the
decision
of
the
board
would
be
reviewable
in
the
federal
circuit.
and,
in
fact,
in
federal
employment
cases,
retaliatory
discharge
claims
come
up
frequently,
and
the
federal
circuit
rules
on
those.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
would
argue
no,
that,
in
fact,
the
employee
has
a
duty
to
exhaust
his
or
her
administrative
remedies
first.
and
those
remedies
provide
for
notice
of
the
reason
why
you're
being
discharged,
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those...
to
those
charges
in
writing,
and
then
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
before
the
mspb
that
is
de
novo.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
there
is...
in
some
situations
where
the
issue
is
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
there's
an
opportunity
for
arbitration.
and,
in
fact,
it
may
be
that
ultimately
it's
the
arbitrator's
decision
that
goes
to
the
federal
circuit
for
review,
rather
than
the
board's.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
think...
we
think
that
summary
judgment
was
appropriate,
and
that's
because
there
was
no
dispute
about
what
the
employer...
what
the
hospital
knew
and
why
it
fired
nurse
churchill.
regardless
of
what
the
content
of
the
speech
was,
as
it
heard
the
speech
it
was
insubordinate
conversation
on
a
matter
of
personal
concern,
and
it
was
motivated
by
its
belief
of
those
reports
to
fire
her.
and
because
we
don't
think
that
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
disputed
fact
on
that,
that
summary
judgment
was
appropriate.
the
district
court
did
determine
that
there
was
a
dispute
about
the
content
of
the
speech,
but
that...
that
is
no
longer
a
dispute.
the
petitioners
are
conceding,
for
purposes
of
this
decision,
that
she
spoke
on
a
matter
of
public
concern,
in
other
words
on
the
cross-training
policy.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
certainly
should
not,
in
our
view.
in
fact,
especially
if
that
kind
of
conversation
was
directed
at
patients
coming
into
the
hospital,
we
think
it
would
have
an
enormous
disruptive
effect
even
if
it
was
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
and
as
we
understand
pickering,
the
court
can
take
that
into
account
and
say
even
if
the
speech
was...
concerned
a
matter
of
public
interest,
nonetheless
the
discharge
was
still
justified.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
think
that
would
probably
be
a
mixed
question.
it
would
be
a
question
of
fact
to
the
extent
that
it
would
implicate
the...
what
effect
speech
actually
had
on
the
workplace,
and
there
may
be
disputes
about
exactly
what
the
disruptive
effect
was.
ultimately,
it
would
be
a
question
of
law.
i'd
like
to
spend
just
a
moment
speaking
about
the
question
about
whether
an
effects
test
of
the
sort
that's
been
suggested
in
some
of
this
court's
decisions
should
apply
here.
and
we
say
no
because
of
the
distinct
context
in
which
this
case
has
arisen.
the
court
has
made
it
clear
since
pickering
that
when
the
government
acts
as
an
employer,
it
has
interests
in
regulating
employee's
speech
that
differs
significantly
from
those
that
it
possesses
in
connection
with
regulating
the
speech
of
the
citizenry
in
general.
and
in
the
context,
the
court
made
clear
that
in
an
employment
at
will
situation
like
this
one,
the
government
can
discharge
an
employee
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
at
all,
as
long
as
it
is
not
motivated
by
a
desire
to
retaliate
against
the
employee
for
engaging
in
protected
speech.
i
thank
the
court.
