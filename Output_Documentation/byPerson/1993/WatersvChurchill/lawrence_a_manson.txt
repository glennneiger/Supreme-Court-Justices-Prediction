mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
public
officials
risk
substantial
liability
if
they
terminate
employees
based
on
believable
reports
of
insubordinate
remarks,
substantiated
by
two
other
people,
witnesses
to
the
conversation
in
question,
if
other
witnesses
later
come
forward
and
convince
a
jury
that
the
employee
actually
spoke
on
matters
of
concern
to
the
public.
although
it...
although
it
expressly
rejected
churchill's
claim
of
a
right
to
due
process
under
the
first
amendment,
the
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
held
that
an
employer
unaware
of
protected
speech
because
of
an
inadequate
investigation
may
be
held
liable
for
retaliatory...
retaliatory
discharge,
regardless
of
what
the
employer
knew
at
the
time
of
the
termination,
and
even
if
its
lack
of
knowledge
was
accidental.
this
unpreceded
holding
conflicts
with
this
court's
requirement
that
protected
speech
be
a
substantial
or
motivating
factor
in
the
termination
decision
for
a
constitutional
violation
to
be
found.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case,
none
at
all,
that
defendants
ever
were
informed
that
cheryl
churchill
had
discussed
issues
of
public
concern
on
january
16,
1987
with
a
cross-trainee
in
that
department,
melanie
perkins-graham.
thus
the
defendants
could
not
have
intended
to
retaliate
against
churchill
for
her
allegedly
protected
speech
when
they
made
the
decision
to
terminate
her
employment.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
your
honor...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
your
honor,
we
believe
that
under
the
celotex
case
and
the
rules
of
rule
56(e)
on
summary
judgment,
that
when
the
moving
party
moves
for
summary
judgment
and
the
burden
of
proof
for
a
particular
issue
is
on
the
nonmoving
party,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
nonmoving
party
to
present
evidence
that
would
sustain
a
jury
verdict
in
that
party's
favor.
and
so
what
has
happened
here,
we
have
moved
for
summary
judgment.
we
have
said
that
all
the
reports
of
protected
speech
that
we...
i'm
sorry,
all
the
reports
of
speech
we
heard
about
that
conversation
on
january
16
related
to
personal
grievances,
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
your
honor,
in
the
district
court
respondent
conceded
and
said
that
they
had
no
doubt
that
the
report
submitted
by
mary
lou
ballew,
who
was
the
employee
that
overheard
the
conversation,
and
melanie
perkins-graham,
who
was
a
cross-trainee
to
which
cheryl
churchill
spoke
that
evening...
the
respondent...
the
respondent
had
no
doubt
that
those
reports
to
the
first
level
supervisor,
cindy
waters,
and
the
director
of
nursing,
kathy
davis,
could
be
construed
in
such
a
fashion,
that
is
as
unprotected
speech.
that
citation
is
on
page
29
of
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
burden
on
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
to
bring...
is
to
present
evidence
to
the
court
that
could
sustain
a
jury
verdict
in
her
favor.
pursuant
to
rule
56(e)
and
the
celotex
case,
there
must
be
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
speech
that
night,
yes,
cheryl
churchill
does
have
her
version
of
what
she
said.
but
our
contention
here
is
that
for
there
to
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
the
defendants
must
be
motivated
by
knowing
of
protected
speech,
and
our
argument
here
is
that
all
the
defendants
knew
about
was
comments
of
personal
matters,
grievances
against
the
supervisor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
person
that
overheard
the
speech
has
been
deposed
several
times.
she
gave
reports
at
the
time.
there
are
notes
of
those
reports.
and
what
we
contend
is
the
defendants
cannot
be
motivated
against
public
speech
if
they
don't
know
about
it,
and
all
they
knew
about
was
unprotected
speech.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
they
were
told.
for...
first
of
all,
the
employee
that
overhead
the
speech
said
that
churchill
had
talked
to
the
cross-trainee
about
the
problems
in
the
department
to
the
point
where
the
cross-trainee
wasn't
interested
in
working
there
anymore.
this
is
sabotage
of
the
employer's
training
efforts
in
an
understaffed
department
to
try
and
get
additional
people
trained
there.
the
witness
was
then
asked:
"and
what
impelled
you
to
make
that
report?
"
and
mary
lou
ballew,
the
employee
that
overheard
the
conversation,
said:
"i
thought
the
ob
department
was
a
good
place
to
work
and
i
hated
to
see
people
who
wanted
to
work
there
being
turned
off
by
it.
"
she
then
was
asked:
"why
did
you
think
she
needed
to
know
that.
"
meaning
the
supervisor
to
whom
she
reported
the
speech.
and
she
said:
"i
thought
it
had
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
department.
"
"i
thought
it
had
foiled
the
attempt
to
get
somebody
in
the
department
that
could
help
with
staffing.
"
that's
what
impelled
this
employee,
who
overheard
the
conversation,
to
go
to
her
supervisors.
then
we
turn
to
the
employee
herself,
the
cross-trainee
that
was
the
subject
of
this
speech.
she
said
that
the
overall
message
was
not
a
positive
one
as
far
as
cheryl
churchill's
relationship
with
her
immediate
supervisor,
cindy
waters.
she
said
at
her
deposition
that
the
general
gist
of
the
conversation
was
negative
feelings
between
cheryl
churchill
and
her
immediate
supervisor,
cindy
waters.
she
said
in
the...
in
the...
it's
reflected
in
the
notes
of
her
conversation
with
kathy
davis,
the
director
of
the
nursing
area,
and
cindy
waters,
the
director
of
that
unit,
that
she
recognized
that...
at
the
end
of
that
conversation
she
said:
"i
know
that
the
hospital
cannot
tolerate
this
kind
of
negative
attitude.
"
so
we
had...
we
had
these
reports
from
both
the
cross-trainee
to
which
cheryl
churchill
spoke,
and
we
had
the
report
of
the
employee
that
overheard
the
conversation,
an
employee
working
in
an
understaffed
department
of
the
hospital
who,
perhaps
because
it's
understaffed,
has
to
take
more
on
call
or
work
weekends.
and
we
had
those
reports
and
that
is
the
only
information
that
could
possibly
motivate
the
employer.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
if
the
reports
were
inaccurate,
your
honor,
we
still
believe
that
under
the
connick
case--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--the
employer
did
not
learn
more
later,
your
honor,
until
this
lawsuit
was
filed.
cheryl
churchill
was
confronted
when
she
was
terminated,
by
cindy
waters
and
kathy
davis,
with
the
fact
that
she
was
being
terminated
for
general
insubordination
and
for
a
conversation
with
a
cross-trainee
on
the
evening
shift
for
15
or
20
minutes.
she
did
not
respond
at
that
time.
when
i
asked--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
what
the
report
of
that
conversation
by
cheryl
churchill
herself,
in
her
own
notes,
reflects
of
that
meeting.
mr.
hopper
started
that
meeting
off
by
saying,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
three
things.
first
of
all,
the
warning
you
received
in
august
for
insubordinate
action.
secondly,
the
evaluation
that
you
received
in
january,
where
there
were
comments
about
her
insubordination.
and
third,
about
the
conversation
with
the
cross-trainee.
cheryl
churchill
did
not
avail
herself
of
that
opportunity,
but
instead
wanted
to
tell
hopper
what
was
wrong
with
a
nursing
unit
of
the
hospital.
and
so
we
contend
again,
your
honor--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--it
is
possible,
your
honor,
that
if,
in
effect,
the
defendants
had
forced
her
to
give
her
version
of
the
events,
that
might
have
happened.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
i
suppose
that
it's
possible,
your
honor.
but
we
would...
we
would
submit
that
even
in
that
event,
the
hospital
could
still
lawfully
have
terminated
this
employee.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
your
honor,
our
theory
is
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
first
amendment
violation,
the
employer's
action
must
be
motivated
by
protected
speech.
so
it's
not
really
good
faith--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--i
think
if
the...
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
think
that
deals
more
clearly
with
the
prior
restraint
rulings
of
this
court
in
terms
of
an
overbroad
rule
and
if
the
rule
is
appropriate.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
we
believe...
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
whatever
the
result
in
that
case...
and
i'm
not
sure,
but
that
the
effect
here
is
that
under
mount
healthy
the
employer
has
to
know
that
there...
and
has
to
be
acting
on
the
basis
of
protected
speech
for
there
to
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
we
would
say
to
that,
your
honor,
that
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
i
believe,
your
honor,
that's
what
the
connick
v.
myers
case
stands
for.
that
speech
in
that...
in
that
case
was
not
protected
speech,
and
so
it
was
deemed
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
another
case,
although
it
goes
the
other
way,
would
be
rankin
v.
mcpherson,
where
the
employee
was
clearly
engaged
in
protected
speech,
talking
about
the
ceta
program,
food
stamps,
medicaid.
and
this
was
on
the
day
that
president
reagan
was
shot,
and
in
the
middle
of
that
conversation
the
employee
says
if
they
go
for
again...
him
again,
i
hope
that
they
get
him.
now,
in
that
case
the
court
can
agree
or
not
agree
as
to
whether
that
particular
item
of
speech
is
protected
or
not,
but
i
think
that
the--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
is
the...
the
holding
of
mount
healthy
and
connick.
i
believe
it
comes
from
the
arlington
heights--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--it
was,
your
honor.
mount
healthy
was
the
second
prong.
we're
arguing
the
first
prong
here,
and
that
is
we
don't
even
get
to
the
but-for
causes.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
we
are
not
talking
about
a
mistake
as
to
the
words
that
are
spoken.
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
your
honor,
is
the--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
what
was
reported
to
us--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
right.
and
what
we
say
is
no
matter
what
version
of
the
speech
cheryl
churchill
says,
and
even
if
that
version
were
protected...
and
we
contend
that
she
did
admit
talking
about
her
evaluation,
she
did
admit
talking
about
her
supervisor,
she
did...
but
what
we
say
is
that
even
if
you
take
her
version,
cheryl
churchill
cannot
contest
the
fact
that
this...
these
other
reports
were
given
to
us
and
those
are
totally
insubordinate,
unprotected
speech.
and
the
employer,
knowing
only
of
the
unsubord...
insubordinate
speech
and
having
no
reports,
after
talking
to
the
employee
that
overheard
it
three
times,
after
talking
to
the
employee
that
received
the
speech,
the
employer
can
only
act
on
the
basis
of
what
it
knows.
and
it
is
unrefuted
in
this
case
that
the
only
evidence
the
defendants
had
was
the
information
that
was
given
to
them
in
these
reports.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
in
the
context
of
what
the...
the
information
i
read
before
about
the
impact
that
this
speech
made
on
the
others.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
disruption
in
this
case
was
the
employee
that
over...
that
actually
overheard
the
speech
was
upset
about
it.
she
is
there
to
help
train
cross-trainees
as
well,
and
she
sees
her
coemployee
undermining
not
only
efforts
of
the
hospital,
but
her
own
efforts
to
get
additional
people
in
to
help
staff.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
not
contested
by
either
side
here.
there
were
significant
staffing
problems.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
i
would
strongly
urge
this
court
that
this
matter
should
not
be
sent
back
on
remand,
but
in
fact
that
summary
judgment
was
appropriate
in
this
case.
in
response
to
justice
souter's
comment,
we
have
conceded,
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment,
that
cheryl
churchill's
version
of
what
she
said
that
night
is
correct,
but
that
was
not
what
was
reported.
and
the
test
under
connick
is
that
if
an
employer
reasonably
believes
that
an
employee
grievance
has
occurred,
insubordination,
then
the
employer
can
act
to
terminate
the
employee.
in
the
connick
case
it
is
said
that
a
public
employee
gets
no
greater
first
amendment
rights
for
a
personal
grievance
than
does
a
private
employee,
and
we
think
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
and
it
also
found
that
under
the
pickering
balance--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--the
district
court
held,
your
honor,
that
under
either
version
of
the...
of
the
case,
that
the
point
of
the
speech,
the
employee's
point
of
the
speech...
because
cheryl
churchill
admitted,
in
addition
to
her...
in
her
version
of
the
speech,
that
she
talked
about
nonprotected
items,
namely
her
evaluation
and
her
thoughts
concerning
the
manager
of
that
unit.
and
what
the
employee
that
overheard
the
conversation
said
was
the
overall
message
was
not
a
positive
one
as
far
as
cheryl
churchill's
relationship
with
cindy
waters.
she
discussed
the
evaluation.
she
told
me
she
and
cindy
waters
didn't
get
along.
cheryl
said
that
cindy
waters
had
said
that
they
should
wipe
the
slate
clean
in
that
evaluation
session,
and
cheryl
churchill
told
cindy
waters
it
wasn't
possible
to
do
that.
she
said
cindy
waters
didn't
do
much,
and
that
the
general
gist
of
that
conversation
was
negative
feelings
between
cheryl
churchill
and
cindy
waters.
we
contend
that
is
not,
in
any
way,
protected
speech.
and
we
contend,
furthermore,
that,
under
mount
healthy,
it
was
only
these
reports
that
motivated
the
employer.
and
i
want
to
ask
this--
mr.
lawrence
a.
manson
--i
thank
the
court.
