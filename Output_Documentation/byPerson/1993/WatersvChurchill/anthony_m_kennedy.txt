justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
your
theory
that
good
faith
is
an
absolute
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
employer
has
a
rule
that
you
have
to
have
a
permit
before
you
hold
a
meeting
in
the
cafeteria.
and
the
employee
holds
a
meeting
in
the
cafeteria
to
talk
about
a
matter
of
public
concern
and
the
employer
fires
the
person
because
they
didn't
have
a
permit,
but
the
employer's
wrong,
they
did
have
a
permit;
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
assume
it's
a
valid
time,
place,
and
manner
rule.
you
have
to
have
a
permit
before
you
meet
in
the
cafeteria;
that's
a
valid
rule.
let's
at
least
assume
it
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under...
under
my
theory,
the...
under
my
hypothetical,
the
employer
acts
under
a
mistaken
assumption
of
fact.
in
fact,
the
employee
was
engaging
in
protected
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
you
agree
that
an
employer
can
have
reasonable
rules
on
time,
place,
and
manner
for
addressing
problems
of
public
concern.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
you
agree
that
one
of
those
rules
might
be
that
you
don't
criticize
the
hospital
during
the
middle
of
an
operation,
of
a
surgical
operation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
your...
in
your
view,
what
are
the
standards
that
an
employer
must
follow
in
evaluating
a
report
that
there
has
been
disruptive
speech
that's
nonprotected--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--before
the
employer
can
terminate
the
employee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
you
to
just
confine
yourself
to
what
the
legal
standard
ought
to
be.
we
can
evaluate
the
facts
of
this
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
think
we
need
to
reach
that
decision.
what
should...
what's
the
answer
to
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
didn't
take
this
case
to
determine
who
said
what
in
the
cafeteria.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
determine
this
case
to
see
what
the
rule
of
law
ought
to
be
if
an
employer
acts
on
reasonable,
substantiated
information,
but
is
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
can
be
no...
no...
there
can
be
no
reinstatement?
an
employee
can
engaged
in
protected
speech,
it
can
be
proven
that
it's
protected
speech,
but
there's
no
reinstatement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
opposed
to
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
we
explore
what
the
answer
might
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
there's
a
distinction
between
employer's
liability
for
reinstatement
and
the
employer's
liability
for
damages
under
1983?
