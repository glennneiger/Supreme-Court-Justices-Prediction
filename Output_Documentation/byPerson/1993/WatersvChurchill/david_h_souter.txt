justice
david
h.
souter
well,
she...
she
responded
at
the
grievance
hearing
and
she
wasn't
allowed
to
put
in
her
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
she
had
been
allowed
to
do
that,
isn't
it
likely
that
it
would
have
come
out
that
that
was,
in
fact,
part
of
the
substance
of
the
conversation
that...
that
was...
that
is
at
issue
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
possible
that
if
she
had
allowed
to
discuss
the
subject
that
she
wanted
to
discuss,
that
it
would
have
come
out
too,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
manson,
you've
spoken
several
times,
as
you
did
in
your
brief,
about
the
need
to
prove
that
the...
in
effect,
the
motivation
of
the
employer
was
retaliation
against
protected
speech.
now,
our
cases
have
gone
into
motivation
when
the
issue
has
been
was
the...
was
the
reason
for
the
discharge
something
that
was
unprotected,
as
opposed
to
a
response
to
that
which
was
protected.
but
have
we
ever
held
that
retaliation
is,
in
fact...
an
across-the-board
retaliation
for
protected
speech
is,
in
fact,
a
requirement
for
liability?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
issue
in
that
case,
as
i
understand
you,
as
you
have
just
phrased
it,
is
whether,
in
fact,
the
impetus
for
the
employer's
action
was
the
protected
speech
or
the
remarks
about
the
success
of
the
assassination
attempt.
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that...
when
the
contest
in
the
case
is
between
what
was
the
cause,
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
we
have
pronounced
an
across-the-board
rule
that
retaliation
against
protected
speech...
in
other
words,
an
intent
test
as
opposed
to
an
effects
test
is
always
going
to
be
the
test
here.
and
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
a
case
that
does
hold
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wasn't
mount...
wasn't
mount
healthy
a
dual
motivation
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
my
question
is
do
we
have
cases
that
discuss
the
first
prong
as
a
requirement
totally
independent
of
the
issue
that
arises
with
the
second?
and,
i
mean,
for
example,
we've...
to
counter
it
as
recently
as
simon
&
schuster,
we're
talking
about
an
effects
test.
we
said
we
don't
care
what
the
motivation
was
here.
it's
the
effect
that
we're
concerned
with.
and
it
strikes
me
as
odd
that
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
standard
in
the
context
that
you're
dealing
with.
mr.
manson,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
mistake
as
to
the
content
of
the
speech.
if
the
employer
was
right
about
the
content
of
the
speech,
that
it
didn't
contain
anything...
any
matter
of
political
concern,
not...
are
you
talking
about
motive
at
all
in
that
respect?
you're
talking
about
a
mistake
as
to
the
words
that
were
spoken.
justice
david
h.
souter
mount
healthy
was
a
case
in
which
the
contest
was
a
contest
as
between
motivations,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
couldn't...
couldn't
it
make
a
difference
if,
in
fact,
there...
there
would
be
a
compete...
there
was
a
competing
justification,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
justification
was
the
operative
one,
as
opposed
to
a
justification
of
retaliation
against
protected
speech.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
bisbee,
may
i
ask
you
this
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
it.
at
the
time
the
district
court
acted,
and
hence
when
you
were
describing
to
the
circuit
what
the
district
court
had
before
it...
a
the
time
the
district
court
acted,
was
there
an
affidavit
or
a
deposition
on
file
by
churchill
saying
i
was
talking
about
nurse
staffing
in
that
conversation?
justice
david
h.
souter
she
came
out
and
said
it
explicitly,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
i...
do
i
understand
your
theory
to
be
that
if
the
employer
acts
on
a
premise
that's
factually
incorrect,
but
is
nonetheless
reasonable
in
reaching
its
conclusion,
that
a
discharge
of
the
employee...
and
that's
in
those
circumstances...
is
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
bisbee,
what's
the
difference
between
your
standard
for
liability
and
your
standard
for
qualified
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
didn't
they
just
merge
in
what
you
said?
i
thought
they
did.
