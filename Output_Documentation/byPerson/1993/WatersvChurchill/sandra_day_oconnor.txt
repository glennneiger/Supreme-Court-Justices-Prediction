mr.
seamon,
your
time
is
about
to
expire,
and
i
did
want
to
ask
a
question,
please.
the
district
court
said
that
even
if
the...
part
of
the
conversation
was
protected,
there
was
another
part
that
was
inherently
disruptive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
any
version
of
the
facts.
and
therefore
the
firing
was
justified
on
that
basis.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
that.
is
there
a
sufficient
factual
basis
to
grant
summary
judgment
one
way
or
another
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
question...
mixed
question
of
fact
in
law?
what
is
the
question,
whether
it's
justified
as
inherently
disruptive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bisbee,
do
you
take
the
position
that
everything...
that
on
the
record
that
the
court
has
before
it
in
considering
summary
judgment,
that
all
of
the
speech
by
the
employee
was
protected,
all
of
it
was
protected
speech,
or
is
some
of
it
unprotected
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
on
the
basis
of
the
record--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--before
the
court
for
summary
judgment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
all
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in...
and
in
answering
that
question,
you
bear
in
mind
the
connick
case
which
dealt
with
criticism
of
the
management
of
the
district
attorneys
office,
whether
it
was
well
managed
and
had
good
morale,
where
the
court
said
that
was
not
a
matter
of
public
concern?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
a
portion
of
the
speech
went
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
portion
of
the
speech
went
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
another
thing.
do
you
think
that
even
protected
speech
could
also
serve
to
demonstrate
sufficient
disruption
to
the
employer's
operation
that
a
firing
could
be
justified?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
certainly
is
what...
it
certainly
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
held.
i
mean,
the
seventh
circuit
has
used
language
here
that
says
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
motive
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then
maybe
we
need
to
send
it
back,
because
they
seem
to
be
operating
on
a
legal
theory
that
even
you
aren't
here
defending.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
is
no.
92-1450,
waters
versus
churchill.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioners
fired
respondent,
churchill,
because
of
things
she
said
to
a
fellow
employee.
the
petitioners
claimed
that,
as
reported
to
them,
churchill's
statements
were
disruptive
and
were
not
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
churchill,
on
the
other
hand,
said
that
in
reality
her
statements
were
not
disruptive
and
dealt
with
a
matter
of
public
concern
which
would
make
them
protected
by
the
first
amendment
under
the
doctrine
of
connick
versus
myers.
the
district
court
concluded
that
to
determine
whether
a
government's
employment
action
based
on
speech
violates
the
first
amendment
a
court
should
only
consider
the
speech
as
the
supervisor
spot
it
to
be.
the
court,
therefore,
granted
summary
judgment
for
petitioners.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
inquiry
should
focus
on
what
is
actually
said
by
the
employee
even
if
the
supervisors
were
misinformed
about
it.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case.
the
plurality
opinion
holds
that
the
connick
test
should
be
applied
to
the
speech
as
the
supervisor
reasonably
determined
it
to
be
and
concludes
that
in
this
case,
the
supervisor's
determination
was
reasonable.
but,
the
plurality
also
concludes
that
churchill
should
be
allowed
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
the
speech,
as
it
was
reported
to
petitioner,
was
only
a
pretext
and
that
the
real
reason
for
her
discharge
was
other
statements
she
made
earlier,
statements
that
might
have
been
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
opinion
is
joined
by
four
members
of
the
court.
justice
souter
who
has
joined
the
opinion
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justices
kennedy
and
thomas
have
joined;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
