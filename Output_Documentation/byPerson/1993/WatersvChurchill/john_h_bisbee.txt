mr.
john
h.
bisbee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
say
one
thing
by
way
of
introduction,
if
i
may,
please.
this
case,
more
than
any
case
decided
since
pickering
by
this
court,
presents
public
employee
speech
in
a
context
in
which
i
think...
although
i've
done
no
empirical
study
on
the
matter,
in
which
i
think
public
employee
speech
is
most
apt
to
take
place.
that
is
speech
during
a
break
time
or
break
period,
dinner
hour,
or
whatever,
when
employees
in
a
public
agency
talk
about
the
policies
of
the
public
employer,
talk
about
the
policies
of
the
agency
itself,
talk
about
how
the
policies
of
the
employer
are
conforming
to
or
in
furtherance
of
or
sustaining
the
mission
of
whatever
the
agency
may
be.
so
you
have
here
a
very
vital
public
agency.
you
have
a
public
hospital,
and
you
have
a
situation
where
for
6
months
there's
been
a
dispute
ongoing
between
the
professional
nursing
and
medical
staffs
on
a
cross...
on
a
nurse
staffing
device
known
as
cross-training.
disregarding
the
merits
of
cross--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--the
petitioners
raised
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
and
that
question
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
the
seventh
circuit
basically
addressed
the
question
whether
or
not,
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
summary
judgment
was
warranted
to
the
petitioners
in
light
of
what
the
record
showed
and
in
light
of
what
was
reasonably
available
to
the
hospital.
and
what
was
reasonably
available
to
the
hospital,
your
honor,
is
very
explicit
in
this
record.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor,
the
problem
with
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
one,
is
that
after
doing
a
very
careful
analysis
of
the
historical
context
into
which
this
dispute
arose,
then
made
somewhat
of
a
leap,
without
perhaps
the
appropriate
link
in
the
bridge,
and
then
did
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
employer
knew,
so
long
as
it
knew
it
was
dealing
with
speech.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
but,
your
honor,
i
think
that
unfairly
characterizes
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
a
26
or
so
page
opinion
in
which
it
painstakingly...
painstakingly
detailed
the
beginning
of
this
controversy,
beginning
with
dr.
koch
in
1982
and
the
staffing
problems
that
he,
as
the
medical-clinical
director
of
the
ob
department,
had
with--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor,
that
is
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think,
however,
you
can
extract
that
language
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
what
i'm
here
defending
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--i
do
assume
that,
your
honor,
and
i
am
hopeful
that
i'm
trying...
i'm
trying
to
address
that.
the
record
does
not
support
that
the...
that
the...
that
there
were
believable
reports
of
substantiated
insubordinate
speech.
that
just
isn't
what
the
record
shows.
each
one
of
the
individual
petitioners
testified
explicitly
as
to
what
it
was
that
motivated
him
and
her.
waters,
cynthia
waters
who
was
the
department
head
in
ob,
was
the
one
to
whom
ballew,
the
eavesdropper,
overheard...
reported
what
she
had
overheard.
and
what
she
reported
was
this.
she
said
something
bad
is
going
on
and
you
should
be
aware
of
it.
cheryl
took
a
cross-trainer
into
the
kitchen
and
talked
about
you
and
how
bad
things
were
in
ob.
that
was
the
report.
on
that
basis
waters
went
immediately
to
davis
and
to
hopper,
and
she
told
them
what
ballew
had
reported.
davis
and
hopper
said
that's
got
to
be
confirmed
by
talking
to
melanie
perkins--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--absolutely.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
absolutely.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
they
reasonably
knew
that
she
was
dealing
in
protected
speech
because
what
was
reported?
what
was
reported
to
them
was
basically
a
headline.
things
were
bad
in
ob
and
the
administration
was
responsible.
kathy
davis,
the
vice
president
of
nursing
who
implemented
the
cross-training
program,
was
said,
reportively,
to
be
ruining
the
hospital.
and
there
were
a
couple
of
other
general
statements
like
that
which,
again,
were
in
headline
form
only,
saying
that
things
were
bad
in
ob
and
the
administration
was
harming
the
hospital.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
take
the
position,
your
honor,
on
the
record...
on
the
basis
of
what
the
employer
knew,
62
percent--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--well,
on
the
basis
of
the
entire--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record,
i
take
the
position
that
virtually
90
percent
of
her
speech
was
protected
because
she
was
talking
about
the
cross-training
policy.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
there
was...
there
were
some
questions
she
answered.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
but
that
did
not
go
to
the
delivery
of
the
public
office's
public
service.
what
we're
talking
about
here,
a
nurse
staffing
issue
which
directly
affects
patient
care--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--excuse
me?
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
in
this
case
62
percent
of
what
the
employer
knew
at
the
time
they
discharged
her
is
consistent
with
the
speech
being
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
do,
i
concede
that.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
record,
however,
your
honor,
to
support
that
that
happened.
the
only
way
the
district
court
came
up
with
its
inherently
disruptive
theory
is
this
way.
there
are
38
pages
of
cheryl
churchill's
testimony.
the
district
court
considered
three
of
those
pages.
it
disregarded
altogether
the
testimony
of
the
supervisor
of
the
shift
in
question,
who
corroborated
100
percent
that
cheryl
churchill's
speech
was
on
this
public
concern
issue.
it
disregarded
altogether
the
clinic...
the
medical-clinical
director's
testimony,
who
was
present...
who
was
one
of
the
conversants,
who
said
that
the
speech
was
on
this
cross-training
issue.
it
disregarded
altogether
the
testimony
that
it
was
the
cross-trainer
herself
who
initiated
the
conversation
on
cross-training.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor,
if
you're
talking
simply
about
mere
statements
of
disparagement,
in
order
to
disparage,
for
the
purpose
of
disparagement.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
if
you're...
to
impose
the
pickering
factors,
to
pose
any
kind
of
the...
the
pickering
factors
test,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
there
has
got
to
be
some
reasonable
basis
for
thinking
that
the
speech
was
doing
that.
you
had
the
speech
in
this
case
given
on
january
16,
1987.
4
days
later,
without
anybody
knowing
about
it,
it
is
brought
by
the
eavesdropper
to
the
attention
of
the
supervisors.
everybody
who
testified
said
there
was
no
disruption.
the
supervisor
on
the
shift
in
question
said
there
was
no
disruption;
in
fact,
that
she
herself
would
have
been
involved
in
the
conversation
had
she
not
finished
her
dinner.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor,
this
is
fundamental
to
what
the
first
amendment
rights
are
all
about
of
public
employees.
the
whole
basis
of
the
right
to
engage
in
free
speech
is
the
right
to
exchange
ideas,
the
idea
that
truth
comes
out
in
the
exchange
of
ideas
and
the
competition
of
the
market.
how
do
you...
how
do
you--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor,
number
one,
i
disagree
with
your
assessment
that
there
was
a
subordinate
employee
here.
it
was
a
coemployee.
it
was
a
nurse
from
another
floor
is
all.
a
coemployee--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor,
the
thing
is,
though,
the
whole
idea
of
free
speech,
the
whole
idea
of
public
employee
speech
is
the
refinement
of
knowledge,
so
that
the...
because
these
public
employees
are
the
ones
who
are
possessed...
that's
what
pickering
held,
they
are
the
ones
who
are
possessed
of
how
something
is
working.
these
are
people
exchanging
notes.
she
stood
to
teach...
cheryl
churchill
stood
to
teach
the
other
employee
what...
her
perspective
of
how
this
nurse
staffing
issue
was
working.
she
stood
to
learn
from
the
other
nurse
how
the
nurse
staffing
issue
was
working.
both
stood
to
learn
from
thomas
koch,
the
doctor,
the
clinical
head,
how
the
nurse
staffing
issue
was
working.
these
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
employees
can
talk
about
and
then
bring
to
the
attention,
perhaps,
of
the
supervisors.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor,
here's
where...
here's
what
that...
here's
where
that
question
leads,
i
believe,
with
all
respect.
she
could
have
gone
out
and
made
a
statement
to
the
newspaper.
she
could
have
done...
she...
i
mean
you're
saying
she
could
have
gone
and
done
the
same
thing,
gone
public
with
something
which
may
have
been
not
fully
accurate,
which
may
have
not
been
fully
accurate
because
she
would
not
have
apprised
herself
or
allowed
herself
the
benefit
of
the
perspective
of,
say,
melanie
perkins-graham.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
but,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
you're
overlooking
the
predicate...
the
predicate
that
is
absolutely
necessary
for
public
employee
speech
to
be
informed.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
yes.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
absolutely.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
agree.
but
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
the
only...
the
only
circumstance
that
happened
in
this
case
was
done
by
cindy
waters
herself,
who
interrupted
a
surgical
procedure
to
start
ordering
people
out
of
the
room,
when
the
surgical
procedure
was
underway,
being
performed
by
a
doctor,
no
less.
and
when
the
doctor
attempted
to
reprimand
the
nurse,
this
cindy
waters,
for
having
interrupted
the
operation,
what
happened?
the
head
of
the
hospital
takes
notes,
copious
notes.
i
couldn't
have
done
it...
no
one
could
do
it
better
himself
to
show
what
a
concerned
doctor
this
is,
talking
about
just
what
you
said,
how
bad
it
is
to
interrupt
operations,
surgical
procedures.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
it's
not
credible
information.
i
disagree
with
that,
number
one.
but,
number
two...
but,
number
two--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--i
understand
that.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
but
from
the
beginning
of
my
opposition
to
cert,
i've
questioned
that
the
record
supports
anything
like
that.
but,
number
two,
your
question
goes
directly
to
the
point
you
and
justice
souter
were
bringing
up
earlier.
mount
healthy,
unlike...
unlike
any
of
the
other
cases,
is
a
mixed
speech
motive.
i
mean,
this
is
a
mixed
speech
motive
case,
whereas
mount
healthy
was
a
straight
mixed
motive
case.
here
you
have
a
mixed
speech
motive
case
which
sort
of
ties
in,
then,
with
a
pretext-type
case.
and
i'm
willing
to
con...
i'm
willing
to
assume
that
i've
got
the
obligation
to
show,
at
least
prima
facie,
that
the...
that
the...
that
her
speech,
as
reported,
motivated
the
discharge,
the
retaliatory
action.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor,
i--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--your
honor,
i
don't
think...
i
think
you
can
affirm
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
and
indicate
that
the
ground
of
decision
has
to
be
somewhat
different.
because
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
not
irrelevant,
and
i
think
that
you've
got
to
understand
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
writing
in
the
context
of
the
historical
context,
directly
out
of
arlington
heights,
directly
out
of
washington
v.
davis.
and
if
you
think
of--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--well--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--all
right,
look
at
it
in
terms
of
arlington
heights,
where
it
talks
about
the
historical
context.
the
standard
ought
to
be
is
their
view
a
reasonable
one.
i
don't
say
at
this
point
there's
a
duty
to
investigate,
but
in
this
case
they
talked
to
only
those
people
who
corroborated
that
it
was
insubordinate
speech.
they
did
nothing
else.
they
made
a
conscious
decision
not
to
talk
to
cheryl
churchill.
why
did...
how
do
we
know
it's
a
conscious
decision--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--all
right.
if
their
information
is
reasonable,
is
reasonably
based,
objectively
reasonably
based,
and
this
brings
into
bear...
this
brings
to
bear
footnote
6
out
of
anderson
v.
creighton.
if
it's
reasonably
based
that
the
speech
was
insubordinate,
i
think
they're
entitled
to
take...
i
think
that
summary
judgment
would
have
been
appropriate
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
but
that
couldn't
have
been
reasonably
based
in
this
case
because
what
they
acted
on...
what
they
acted
on
was
consistent,
fully
consistent
with
her
speech
being
on
the
protected
issue
of
the
nurse
staffing
problem
of
cross-training:
kathy
davis
ruining
the
hospital,
things
bad
in
ob.
if
you
look
at
the
depositions
of
hopper,
you
look
at
the
depositions
of
davis,
that's
what
they
acted
upon.
not
only
that,
they
had
no
reason
to
disbelieve...
and
i
know
i
stress
that
perhaps
ad
nauseam
in
the
brief,
for
which
i
ask
your
forgiveness.
but
nevertheless,
they
had
no
reason
to
disbelieve
that
that
speech
had
anything...
was
on
anything
other
than
cross-training.
the
standard
has
to
be
an
objectively
reasonable
one,
and
it's
not
reasonable
if,
in
fact,
there
is
no
attempt,
when
you're
talking
first
amendment...
and
you...
you
pointed
out
in
a
recent
dissent
last
term,
your
honor,
that
there
is
the
notion
of
some
sensitive
inquiry
which
the
first
amendment,
by
itself,
imposes,
some
inquiry
as
to
what
the
circumstances
were.
and
connick
itself
says
that
the
speech
has
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
the
whole
record.
what--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--i
don't
accept
that
the
employer
was
ignorant
of
what
the
context...
content
of
the
speech
was.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
your
honor,
far
be
it
from
me
to
venture
a
guess
as
to
how
the
seventh
circuit
arrived
at
that
particular
dicta.
but
i
think
that's
all
that
it
is,
is
dicta,
because
i
think
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
fully
consistent
with
the
very
detailed
historical
analysis
that
the
seventh
circuit
did.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
absolutely...
i
did
not.
i
did
not
make
that
argument.
what
i
was
doing,
basically,
was
showing
that
there
were
issues
of
fact
in
all
respects,
as
to
the
content,
the
context,
and
the
form
of
the
speech,
in
order
to
get
around
the
summary
judgment
that
had
been
imposed
against
me
in
the
district
court.
it
may
have
been
my
fault,
your
honor.
i
may
have
not
properly
given
the
seventh
circuit
an
analytical
framework.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
38
pages.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
38
pages
worth,
explicitly.
the
district
court
considered
only
three
of
those
pages,
and
in
those
three
pages
the
district
did
not
consider
she
was
being
asked
matters
of
what
she
did
not
say,
not
what
she
said.
and
then
it
went
on
and
said
that
melanie
perkins-graham
was
more
explicit.
melanie
perkins-graham,
in
her
report,
said
she
didn't
remember
exactly
what
was
said,
except
that
kathy
davis
was
ruining
the
hospital,
and
things
were
bad
in
ob
and
the
administration
was
responsible.
the
problem,
as
i
see
it,
was
adumbrated
by
you
in
an
earlier
question,
justice
souter,
to
the
effect
that
what
happens
under
mount
healthy
if
you
merge
the
mount
healthy
formula
with
the
anderson
v.
creighton
formula
set
forth
in
the...
in
footnote
number
6?
that's
where
you
come
up
with
the
notion
that
there's
got
to
be
some
reasonable
basis
for
the
employer
to
believe
that
the
speech
was
protected.
and
here
what
they
acted
upon
was
fully
consistent
with
the
nurse...
with
the
6-month
dispute
on
the
cross-training.
and
furthermore,
under
arlington
heights,
if
you
look
at
how...
you
can
determine
from
the
context
or
the
sequence
of
events
what
motivated
someone,
what
motivated
the
petitioners
in
this
case
was
her
free
speech.
for
example,
they
disregarded
their
own
procedures
when
it
came
to
doing
such
things
as
viewing
dr.
koch's
written
concerns,
that
hopper
noted.
at
no
point
after
this
code
pink...
which
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
churchill.
the
code
pink
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
churchill
and
the
attempted
beginning
of
the
end
for
dr.
koch.
they
went
and...
the
three
of
the,
hopper,
davis,
and
waters
concluded
that
koch
was
a
guy
who
was
out
of
control
because
he
had
a
temper,
because
he
was
angry
at
his
procedure
being
interrupted.
did
the...
did
those
three
individuals
bring
to
anybody's
attention
that
he
had
tremendous
policy
concerns
about
what
was
going
on
in
ob?
they
did
not.
they
instead
initiated
the
action
to
take
away
his
staff
privileges,
and
they
gave
churchill
a
written
warning
for
having
simply
snapped
at
waters
when
she
gave,
waters,
an
instruction
contrary
to
what
the
doctor
had
said.
but
worse
than
that,
worse
than
that,
at
her
year-end
evaluation...
and
this
is
critical,
her
year-end
evaluation
3
weeks
before
she
was
discharged,
she's
given
a
tremendous...
a
good
evaluation
in
all
respects.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
there...
what
was
the
motive
of
the
hospital,
your
honor.
and
the
thing
is,
i...
as
i'm
trying--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--but,
your
honor,
that's
the
problem
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
the
facts
posed
in
the
petitioner's
question--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--i'm
sorry
if
i
haven't
done
that,
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
doesn't
even
really
need
to
reach
that
question.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
exactly.
if
the...
if
you're
talking
now
purely
hypothetically,
and
unlike
what
i
say
the
record
shows
in
this
case.
if
you're
saying
that
an
employer
reads...
hears
substantiated
reports,
believable,
of
insubordinate
speech,
what
can
it
do;
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
that
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
the
answer
to
it...
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
it.
because...
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
it.
that
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
understand
that.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
your
honor,
but...
see...
and
i
didn't
want
to
have
the
temerity
to
suggest
that
the
writ
had
been
perhaps
improvidently
granted,
because
there's
a
lot
of
effort
that's
involved
in
that.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
record
simply
doesn't
support
that
question.
and
i
know
i've
been
arguing
for
25
or
maybe
27
minutes,
now,
on
that
point.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
pardon
me?
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
yes,
your
honor,
i
did.
i
did.
i
argued
that,
that
it's
simply
not
presented.
that
isn't
what
the
record
in
this
case
shows.
and
i
say
that
with
some
trepidation--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--the
seventh
circuit
used
language
that
was
broader
than
it
needed
to.
the
seventh
circuit
used
language
that
was
broader
than
the
analysis
the
seventh
circuit
used.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
that
is
basically
correct.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
send
it
back.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
affirm
the
judgment
and
say
that
the
legal
test
employed
by
the
seventh
circuit
was
not
altogether
correct.
i
mean,
i'm
not
arguing--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--that's
what
i've
argued,
if
the
employer
is
reasonable.
but
that
takes
into
account
the
content,
the
context,
the
form
of
the
speech.
that
takes
into
account...
the
procedures,
as
you
have
pointed
out,
are
necessarily
implied
by
the
first
amendment
itself
when
speech
is
at
issue.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
absolutely
not.
we're
talking
about
objective
reasonableness.
if
the
employer's
reasoning.
if
the
employer--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--i
disagree.
i
think
the
objective
reasonableness
standard
that's
been
imposed
by
this
line
of...
by
the
line
of
decisions
in
this
court
culminating
in
anderson
v.
creighton
and
hunter
v.
bryant,
is
far
different.
it's
a
kind
of...
it's
a
kind
of
standard
which
indicates
that
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
governmental
power,
that
a
reasonable
governmental
officer
would
have
known
that
what
he
was
doing
was
violating
the
law.
that's
how
you
phrased
it
in
anderson--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--huh?
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
think
that
you've
indicated
it's
different
from
negligence.
i...
that's
how
i've
read
anderson
v.
creighton,
your
honor.
i've
read
anderson
v.
creighton
as
being
fully
consistent...
fully
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
things
like
daniels
v.
williams,
where
we...
where
you've
held
that
negligence
is
not
actionable.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
you
know,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
they
come
awfully
close
to
merging.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i...
that's
what
i
was...
we're
talking
here
about
a
mixed
speech
motive
case.
that's
why,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
questions,
i
say
if
the
information
that
the...
that
the
employer
has
is
reasonable
that
the
speech
is
unprotected
and
insubordinate,
the
employer
is
justified
in
discharging.
but
the
speech...
the...
but
the--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
didn't
say
that.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
all
i'm
talking--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--yes.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
well,
yes,
i
think
the
governmental...
the
governmental
entity
could
remain
liable,
and
the
governmental
entity,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
held,
would
be
liable
for
reinstatement.
the
individuals
might
be...
might...
could
be
immune
from
money
damages.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
that's
correct,
your
honor.
my
time--
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
--both.
mr.
john
h.
bisbee
thank
you,
your
honor.
