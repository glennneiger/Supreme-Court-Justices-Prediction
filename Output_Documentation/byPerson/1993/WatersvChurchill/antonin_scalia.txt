justice
antonin
scalia
i
should
think
so.
that
has
to
be
your
answer,
that
that
employer
is
guilty
of
a
wrongful
firing,
and
it
would
be
a
wrongful
firing
of
somebody
who
wanted
to
have
a
meeting
with
a
proper
permit
for
a
matter
of
public
interest,
just
as
it
would
be
a
wrongful
firing
of
somebody
who
wanted
to
have
a
meeting
on
a
different
subject.
but
you
have
to
take
the
position,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it's
no
first
amendment
violation,
it's
just
a
wrongful
dismissal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
why
would
mixed
motive
make
a
difference
if
motive
doesn't
make
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't...
then
i
don't
understand
why
your
response
is...
mount
healthy
still,
mixed
motive
or
not,
is
right
on
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
why
would
mixed
motive
make
a
difference
if
what
your
real
motive
is
doesn't
make
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
still...
i
still
don't
understand...
i
still
don't
understand
that.
it
seems
to
me
the
inquiry
in
mount
healthy
was
whether
the
motive
for
firing
was
the
unlawful
motive.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
assertion
was,
well,
there
may
have
been
mixed
motives
and...
but,
still,
doesn't
it
assume
that
you
have
to
prove
the
bad
motive?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
is
it
not
possible
for
speech
to
be
insubordinate
even
though
it
deals
with
a
subject
of
public
concern?
must
a
hospital
allow
all
of
its
personnel,
in
particular
supervisory
personnel,
to
go
around
and
tell
subordinate
employees
this
is
the
worst
hospital
in
the
world?
must
that
be
allowed?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
disregarded
that.
justice
o'connor's
question
is,
even
assuming
that
it
was
about
the
cross-training
issue,
might
that
not
be
a
valid
cause
for
discharge?
does
every
employee
of
a...
of
a
public
hospital
have
a
right
to
go
about
running
down
the
hospital
to
subordinates
simply
because
that
employee
doesn't
like
the
way
the
hospital's
being
run,
and
that
is
a
public
issue
and
therefore
it
can
be
done
constantly?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
she
had
been
telling
this
to
the
super...
to
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
hospital
or
someone
who
had
the
authority
to
change
the
situation
that
she
thought
was
bad
for
the
public,
i
could
understand
it.
but
telling
it
to
a
subordinate
nurse,
what
did
she
hope
to
achieve
by
telling
it
to...
to
one
of
the
cross-trainees
except
dissatisfaction?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
criticize
the
operation,
so
long
as
it's
a
public
operation,
all
of
the
employees
must
be
free
to
run
down
the
operation
to
subordinate
employees--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
the
subordinate
employees
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
person
of
no
authority
in
the
operation
to
make
the
changes
that
she
thought
were
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
you
think--
--that
would
be
a
much
stronger
case
for
you.
i'd
have
a
lot
more
trouble
with
that
firing
than
i
would
with
this
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
sort
of
a
negligence
standard.
so
if
an
employment...
if
an
employer
is
negligent
about
finding
out
what
the
conversation
was,
he's
guilty
of
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
negligence
is
what
a
reasonable
man
would
not
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
a
reasonableness
standard
and
a
negligence
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
different
from
negligence,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
different
from
negligence.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
district
court
find
that
there
was
a
reasonable
belief
on
the
part
of
the
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did...
it
said
that
explicitly,
that
the
belief
was
reasonable?
