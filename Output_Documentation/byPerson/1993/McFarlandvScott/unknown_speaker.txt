unknown
speaker
when
did
he
ask
that,
counsel?
unknown
speaker
that
was
how
long
after
the
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
denied
from
his
original
conviction?
unknown
speaker
why
did
it
take
that
long
to
worry
about
the
counsel
problem?
unknown
speaker
did
the
texas
resource
center
worry
about
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
it,
5
days
before
his
execution
you
came
in
with
this
motion?
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn't
see
the
problem
arising
until
5
days
before
the
execution,
having
already
gotten
one
extension
of
the
execution,
right?
unknown
speaker
how
many
lawyers
do
you
have
at
the
texas
resource
center?
unknown
speaker
but
this
was
a
man
who
had
been
scheduled
to
be
executed
in
mid-september.
you
had
already
gotten
one
extension,
and
nonetheless,
you
wait
until
5
days
before
the
extended
execution
date
to
come
in
with
a
request
for
counsel.
unknown
speaker
it
was
not.
unknown
speaker
there
were
so
many
easy
ways
to
avoid
it.
i
find
it
extraordinary
to
think
it
was
something
you
did
not
want
to
happen.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
am
circuit
justice
for
the
fifth
circuit,
as
you
know,
and
the
texas
resource
center
comes
in
at
the
last
minute
regularly.
unknown
speaker
eighteen
lawyers
and
you?
unknown
speaker
ms.
welch,
don't
waste
anymore
of
your
argument
time
on
this.
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
i
am
not
happy
with
the
performance
of
the
texas
resource
center
in
the
cases
that
come
before
me
as
circuit
justice.
let's
leave
it
at
that.
unknown
speaker
try
harder.
unknown
speaker
ms.
welch,
you
said
that
the
petitioner
here
had
not
filed...
that
the
reason
for
the
court's
denial
was
he
had
not
filed
a
legally
sufficient
habeas
petition.
had
he
filed
any
habeas
petition
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
did
he
ask
for
a
stay
at
the
same
time?
unknown
speaker
just
to
clarify,
when
the
district
court
did
finally
obtain
counsel
for
mcfarland...
i
think
that
was
on
the
very
eve
of
execution...
then
counsel
did
file
a
pleading
entitled,
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
but
he
then
did
file
a
petition,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
the
district
court
xx
denied
the
stay
based
upon
the
merits
of
an
incomplete
petition,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
a
divided
panel
then
issued
the
stay.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
clear
that
the
state
agrees,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
you
take
the
position
that
848
does
allow
the
appointment
of
counsel
by
the
court
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
habeas?
unknown
speaker
it
does
have
language
of,
in
any
post
conviction
proceeding
under
2254
or
2255
the
appointment
can
be
made,
but
you
think
that
doesn't
limit
it
to--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
district
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
what
is
the
position,
now,
on
that
point,
the
appointment
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
simpler
to
take
the
position
that
a
proceeding
does
require
the
filing
of
a
petition,
but
that
in
order
to
give
effect
to
the
statutory
counsel
guarantee,
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
act
on
the
pro
forma
petition
before
the
appointed
lawyer
has
had
time
to
investigate
and
to
amend,
if
the
lawyer
sees
fit?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
of
course,
i
suppose
the
answer
to
barefoot
is
that
the
statutory
provisions
for
appointment
of
counsel
have
come
after
barefoot,
and
barefoot
should
be
at
least
narrowed
at
least
not
to
frustrate
the
counsel
guarantee.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
realize
that.
maybe
i'm
not
getting
the
point,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
enactment
of
the
statutory
guarantees
for
counsel
in
both
the
state
and
the
federally
derived
habeas
proceedings
reflects
in
effect
a
congressional
judgment
that
there
ought
to
be
more
counsel,
i.e.,
that
there
ought
to
be
a
guarantee
of
counsel
at
the
habeas
stage
in
the
federal
court,
and
i
don't
suppose
that
we
could
in
effect
honor
that
guarantee
that
congress
has
chosen
to
provide
if
barefoot
were
not
narrowed
to
a
degree
in
order
to
allow
counsel
time
to
do
what
counsel
is
supposed
to
be
there
to
do.
unknown
speaker
what
jurisdiction?
jurisdiction
over
what?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
no
matter
how
liberally
you
interpret
the
requirement,
despite
barefoot,
the
provision
for
counsel
only
applies
to
someone
who
is
seeking
habeas
corpus,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
need
some
assertion
of
an
error
in
the
state
court,
not
simply
an
assertion,
i
don't
know
whether
there's
an
error
or
not,
appoint
a
lawyer
for
me
to
see
if
there
was
one.
that's
certainly
not
what
congress
said.
congress
said,
if
there's
an
error
that
you're
claiming,
you're
entitled
to
a
lawyer
to
prosecute
it,
but
don't
you
need
some
assertion
of
an
error,
at
least?
unknown
speaker
to
help
him
prosecute
his
claim
of
error,
but
he
has
to
have
a
claim
of
error.
it's
not
saying
anybody,
whether
he
has
a
claim
of
error
or
not,
is
entitled
to
get
a
lawyer
to
see
if
he
might
have
a
claim
of
error.
that's
not
what
congress
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
further
question
is
the
authority
to
issue
a
stay,
and
turning
your
attention
to
justice
souter's
suggestion
that
a
skeletal
petition
be
filed,
is
that
consistent
with
rule
4
of
the
habeas
rules,
which
requires
that
a
petition
be
dismissed
unless
it
appears
on
its
face
that
there's
a
probability
of
relief?
unknown
speaker
so
if
it
plainly
appears
from
the
facts
of
the
petition
that
he's
not
entitled
to
relief,
nevertheless
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
dismiss
it
in
a
death
case.
unknown
speaker
or
would
you
say
that
you
could
not
determine
from
the
pleading
whether
or
not
he
is
clearly
entitled?
unknown
speaker
and
would
this
apply
in...
just
in
death
cases,
because
that's
the
only
time
in
which
counsel
are
appointed
under
the
statute,
or
would
you
extend
this
rule
to
any
habeas
petition
in
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
court
is
sort
of
a
filing
cabinet
until
the
petition
is
fleshed
out?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you're
interpreting
rule
4
saying
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
dismiss
until
counsel
has
been
obtained.
unknown
speaker
is
it
essentially
your
argument
that
848
contemplates
that
there
will
be
a
lawyer-drawn
petition,
and
not
that
there
will
be
a
petition...
that
the
petition
will
be
drawn
pro
se
by
the
prisoner,
so
that
it
is
848
that
would
inform
everything
else
and
would
take
precedence
over
any
rule?
if
848
entitles
the
defendant
or
petitioner
to
a
lawyer-drawn
petition,
then
the
question
about...
the
other
questions
become
moot.
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
you're
reading
848
to
say,
not
only
are
you
entitled
to
counsel
in
a
capital
proceeding,
but
you
are
entitled
to
counsel
to
draw
your
habeas
petition.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
do
that?
that's
a
very
roundabout
way
to
say
that.
i
mean,
it
would
be
very
easy
for
congress
to
say,
anyone
who
desires
to
file
a
habeas
petition
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
for
that
purpose.
it
did
not
say
that.
it
said,
in
any
post
conviction
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
ms.
welch,
your
opponents
say
that
the
pennsylvania
case,
or
our
case
of
pennsylvania
bureau
of
corrections
v.
u.s.
marshall's,
militates
against
your
contention
that
the
all
writs
act
is
available
to
you.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
subpoenas
ad
testificandum,
yes.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
specific
statute
dealing
with
stays--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
know,
if
you're
reading
things
into
section
848
simply
because
fairness
or
logic
requires
it,
why
do
you
have
to
read
into
it
that
a
stay
of
execution
would
be
available?
it
seems
to
me
the
most
you
would
read
into
it
is
that
if
he
comes
in
soon
enough
to
request
counsel,
counsel
will
be
given
an
opportunity
to
draw
a
habeas
petition,
and
if
that
petition
has
merit,
then
a
stay
can
be
issued,
but
if
you
come
in
5
days
before
the
execution
with
no
claim
at
all
and
ask
for
counsel,
should
you
be
able
to
get
a
stay?
you've
had
180
days.
unknown
speaker
to
stay.
unknown
speaker
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
your
necessity
argument
that
848
must
operate
even
before
a
meritorious
habeas
petition
has
been
filed,
that
argument
only
carries
you
to
the
point
where
you
have
to
allow
them
to
file
it
within
a
reasonable
time
before
a
stay
of
execution
is
necessary,
but
not
5
days
before,
that
requires
federal
courts
to
stay
the
process
of
state
justice.
unknown
speaker
but
its
jurisdiction
comes
from
848,
and
if
848
only
guarantees
that
you
get
counsel
if
you
apply
in
a
timely
fashion
and
not
when
you
decide
5
days
before
your
execution
that
there
may
be
something
wrong,
although
you
can't
really
state
anything
wrong.
unknown
speaker
we
have
to
go
back
to
848,
it
seems
to
me,
whether
you
use
the
all
writs
act
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
welch,
when
is
the
earliest
time
in
this
case
that
you
think
848
would
have
allowed
the
appointment
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
can
you
look
back
and
say
there
is
some
time
after
which
this
request
could
have
been
made?
unknown
speaker
when
was
that?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
no,
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
have
asked
for
counsel
before
that
date
under
848?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
you
didn't
ask
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
until
october
22nd.
that's
the
first
time
you
asked
a
state
court
to
appoint
counsel,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
the
reason
for
not
asking
may
have
been,
the
fact
is
that
you
did
not
ask
for
state
appointment
of
counsel
until
october
22nd,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
welch.
ms.
griffey,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
griffey,
what
is
your
position
now
on
this
section
848?
can
a
defendant
facing
an
execution
obtain
appointment
of
counsel
by
the
federal
court
before
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
habeas?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
is
not
open
to
that
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
some
of
the
amici
supporting
your
views
in
the
case
take
a
different
view,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
normally,
you
would
expect
if
the
habeas
petition
were
going
to
be
prepared
properly
that
some
advance
preparation
might
be
required
by
counsel
and
possibly
investigators.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
if
the
petitioner,
prisoner
himself,
files
the
habeas
petition
and
then
requests
counsel,
that
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
dismiss
the
habeas
petition
based
on
a
review
of
just
what
the
prisoner
has
put,
or
does
a
court
properly
exercise
its
discretion
by
refusing
to
dismiss
the
petition
until
the
attorney
has
looked
at
it?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
court
to
dismiss
the
writ,
thereby
ending
the
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
you
even
say
that
before
you
can
get
counsel
the
petition
has
to
have
some
merit.
unknown
speaker
so
the
critical
document
is
the
filing
of
the
initial
petition?
unknown
speaker
and
congress
you
think
intended
our...
an
interpretation
that
the
critical
document
be
filed
without
counsel?
unknown
speaker
ms.
griffey,
is
there
any
ambiguity
at
all...
what
sense
does
it
make
to
attribute
to
congress
the
purpose
of
having
an
inadequate
petition
filed?
let
us
take,
which
is
not
an
usual
case,
somebody
who
has
a
below-normal
iq.
why
would
congress
want
this
proceeding
to
start
out
with
an
inadequate
pleading?
if
congress
is
providing
for
counsel
on
848,
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
say
that
congress
wants
a
well-pleaded
complaint,
rather
than
an
inadequately
pleaded
complaint?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
this
statute
is
plain
on
its
face,
that
the
statute
requires
the
pro
se
petitioner,
himself,
to
file
the
pleading,
the
essential
pleading
that
is
going
to
govern
the
case,
and
does
not
give
him
a
right
to
counsel
for
that
pleading?
unknown
speaker
is
the
request
for
counsel
a
part
of
the
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
the
request
for
counsel
is
not
a
part
of
the
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
if
it
comes
after,
it
is
a
part
of
the
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
incidental
to
the
proceeding,
then
it's
part
of
the
proceeding?
you're
hesitating
because
if
you
say
yes,
then
the
proceeding
begins,
and
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
before
the
habeas
petition
is
filed,
and
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
plausible
that
congress
intended
to
expand
the
proceedings
under
2254
by
including
that
phase
in
which
counsel
is
appointed
under
848.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
equally
incumbent
on
us
to
construe
our
procedural
rules
in
such
a
way
that
it
does
not
turn
congressional
statutes
into
dead
letters,
and
if
we
continue
to
construe
the
procedural
requirements
as
it
seems
to
me
you
are
asking
us
to
do,
then
848
was
a
waste
of
everyone's
time.
because
if
the
petition
has...
i
will
grant
you,
by
the
way,
for
the
sake
of
argument
and
probably
ultimately,
that
a
petition,
a
habeas
petition
must
be
filed
in
order
for
848
to
kick
in,
but
assuming
that
a
habeas
petition,
once
filed,
may,
without
any
abuse
of
discretion,
be
finally
adjudicated
before
counsel
has
had
so
much
as
a
peek
at
it,
is
to
turn
the
848
guarantee
into
a
farce,
and
haven't
we
got
an
obligation
to
adjust
our
procedural
requirements
in
a
way
that
avoids
that?
unknown
speaker
no.
oh,
with
respect,
i
don't
think...
maybe
i
haven't
made
the
question
clear.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
your
argument
that
is
true
if
the
petitioner
comes
in
on
the
very
first
possible
day,
because
the
petitioner
comes
to
the
court
and
says,
i
want
to
make
a
habeas
claim,
and
i
want
counsel,
and
the
court
says,
in
order
to
get
counsel
you've
got
to
file
a
habeas
claim
in
the
first
place,
and
we'll
assume
that's
correct.
the
petitioner
does
so,
and
on
your
view,
it
is
then
no
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
court
to
look
at
that
petition
and
say,
this
is
no
good.
i
dismiss
it.
or,
indeed,
to
wait
until
counsel
appears
and
says,
i
want
to
amend
the
petition,
and
the
court
says,
oh,
no,
i've
got
the
petition
before
me
and
i'm
going
to
dismiss
it
right
now,
because
it
is
inadequate
for
various
reasons.
i
understood
that
to
be
your
argument,
that
that
would
be
no
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
court
to
do
that.
was
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
okay,
then
848
is
a
farce.
unknown
speaker
no.
we're
talking
about
coming
in
at
the
first
minute.
the
petitioner
is
there.
without
an
abuse
of
discretion
the
court
says,
i
don't
have
to
waste
time
while
you
amend
this
petition,
i've
got
a
petition
in
front
of
me,
it
is
for
any
one
of
various
reasons
inadequate,
and
i
dismiss
it.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
timing.
it
may
well
be...
it
may
well
be
within
the
court's
discretion
not
to
stay,
if
they
deliberately
wait
and
come
in
at
the
last
minute.
we're
not
talking
about
that.
we're
simply
talking
about
the
authority
of
a
court,
consistent
with
our
construction
of
the
constitution
and
the
procedural
rules,
to
dismiss
before
counsel
has
had
a
chance
to
do
anything,
and
you're
saying
it
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
unknown
speaker
is
it
right
that
this
gosch
case,
that
applies
without
regard
to
the
time
of
the
petition?
that
is,
if
the
petition
is
inadequate,
it
can
be
dismissed
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
i
take
that
that's
what
this
case
holds.
the
district
court
can
look
at
the
hand-drawn
petition,
say
it's
no
good,
goes
up
on
review,
affirms
that
it's
no
good,
and
then,
as
justice
souter
said,
where
is
there
room
for
counsel
in
that
picture?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
it's
perfectly
rational
for
the
federal
government
to
say,
where
you've
come
forward
with
a
good
claim,
we'll
give
you
counsel
to
help
you,
but
where
there's
no
good
claim,
we
do
not
provide
counsel
to
engender
a
claim.
that's
perfectly
rational,
and
if
the
language
reads
that
way,
you're
saying
we
should
read
it
that
way.
may
i
ask
a
factual
question?
in
the
first
part
of
the
blue
brief
there's
a
description
of
the
practice,
an
informal
practice
that
had
developed
before
the
gosch
case
was
decided.
is
that
an
accurate
statement
of
what
the
practice
was
before?
unknown
speaker
the
practice
they
described,
as
i
understand
it
they
would
file
a
perfunctory
petition
which
recited
one
claim
that
had
been
raised
on
direct
appeal,
knowing
that
there
might
be
more
there,
but
then
routinely
there
was
no
opposition
to
a
stay,
as
long
as
there
was
a
claim
stated
that
had
been--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
all
changed
after
the
gosch
case.
unknown
speaker
but
wasn't...
mcfarland's
situation
was
that
if
gosch
was
going
to
apply
in
his
case,
and
he
filed
just
this
rudimentary
petition,
he
was
at
grave
risk
of
having
it
thrown
out,
because
it
would
not
have
been
a
well-pleaded
complaint,
and
then
not
being
able
to
come
with
a
counseled
petition?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
he...
that
was
a
real
risk
for
him.
unknown
speaker
that
had
to
do
with
the
timing
of
it.
i
think
ms.
welch
said
she
wanted
to
exhaust
the
state
remedy
route.
but
now
we're
not
talking
about
a
question
of
timing,
as
was
brought
out
in
the
colloquy
with
justice
souter.
it
could
be
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
the
prisoner
writes
is
hand-drawn
petition,
and
it's
no
good.
it
gets
thrown
out,
gets
affirmed
on
appeal,
that's
the
end
of
federal
habeas,
there's
never
been
any
chance
for
848
to
operate,
and
you
say
that's
what
congress
contemplated,
that
the
prisoner
himself
must
write
a
decent
enough
petition...
not
a
pro
forma
petition
of
the
kind
that
went
on
before
gosch,
but
a
really
good
petition.
unknown
speaker
discovered
by
the
prisoner
himself,
if
he
has
no
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
aren't
you
making
an
argument
for
unreasonable
delay
as
opposed
to
an
argument
about
jurisdiction?
maybe
they
waited
until
too
late
here.
maybe
it
would
not
have
been
an
abuse
of
jurisdiction
to
deny
the
stay,
but
we've
got
a
jurisdictional
question
about
the
power
of
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
and
to
grant
a
stay
if
warranted,
and
i
don't
see
how
that
question
turns
on
the
facts
that
you're
arguing.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
want
to...
am
i
interrupting
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
there's
one
question
that
runs
through
my
mind
in
these
cases
when
we
talk
about
the
delay.
this
case
as
i
understand
it
started
in
1988,
early
in
1988
the
man
was
indicted,
and
the
proceedings
in
the
texas
direct
review
system
ended
sometime
in
1993,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
we
have
this
terrible
emergency
a
matter
of
a
few
weeks
after
the
execution
date
is
set.
is
this
period
of
time
where
it's
mostly
in
the
state
court,
typical
in
texas?
you
have
these
long
delays
between
trial
and...
and
then
it
suddenly
becomes
an
emergency
at
the
end
of
4
or
5
years?
unknown
speaker
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
but
then
why
is
there
such
a
sudden
emergency
after
4
or
5
years?
you've
got
to
get
everything
done,
you
can't
let
them
have
2
or
3
weeks
to
get
a
lawyer.
i
don't
understand
the
contrast
between
5
years
on
the
one
hand
and
a
matter
of
weeks
on
the
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
must
say
that
that's...
it's
hard
to
expect
federal
judges
or
any
judges
to
get
excited
about
staying
a
texas
execution
when
texas
itself
diddles
around
for
3
or
4
years
before
trying
the
individual
and
i
think
you
should
bear
that
in
mind.
if
you
want
us
to
get
serious,
you
should
get
serious
yourselves.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
real
delay
here
much
before
that?
if
i
have
the
figures,
the
dates
right,
mcfarland
was
convicted
in
november
of
'89,
but
his
conviction
wasn't
affirmed
on
appeal
until
december
of
'92.
what
accounts
for
that
length
of
time
just
on...
the
direct
appeal
took
so
long...
3
years.
unknown
speaker
it
just
seems
extraordinary
that
you
are
complaining
about
the
few
months
that
lapsed
here
and
said
that
that
was
no
occasion
for
a
stay,
and
yet
in
the
state's
own
process
it
took
over
3
years
to
get
from
the
conviction
to
the
affirmance
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
it
was
defeated...
it
was
pending
in
the
legislature?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
that
the
defeat
had
nothing
to
do
with
giving
the
defendant
adequate
opportunity
to
get
counsel.
it
may
be
that
there
were
other
reasons
for
opposing
the
measure.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
what
the...
what
do
the
capital
defendants'
lawyers
get
paid
in
texas
for
representing
defendants
in
the
state
system?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
are
paid
by
the
state,
though.
unknown
speaker
they
are.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
another
question
about
your...
assuming
we
don't
have
any
deadline
or
time
problems,
and
a
petitioner
just
wants
to
get
a
lawyer
and
he
files
a
perfunctory
petition
that
is
dismissed
as
really
saying
nothing,
and
then
later
he
gets
a
letter
and
he
comes
in
for
the
second
time,
would
it
be
your
position
that
that
second
petition
was
an
abuse
of
the
writ?
unknown
speaker
it
would.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
understand
that
your
essential
position
is
that
what
must
be
done,
and
what
cannot
be
avoided,
is
in
the
first
instance
the
petitioner
himself
file
an
adequate
petition,
uncounseled?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
has
to
happen.
he
has
to
draw
the
petition.
he
cannot
have
a
lawyer,
unless
he
can
pay
for
one,
draw
his
petition,
so
the
well-pleaded
complaint
has
to
come
from
the
pro
se
petitioner.
that's
the
nub
of
your
argument...
that
to
get
your
foot
in
the
door,
he
has
to
do
it
on
his
own.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that...
but
the
constitutional
basis
would
be
coming
in
with
an
adequate
complaint,
and
he
can't
get
counsel
for
that,
and
he's
not
entitled
to
counsel,
you
say,
until
he
has
that
well-pleaded
complaint
on
his
own.
i
took
it
that
that's
what
you
were
saying.
i
just
wanted
you
to
confirm
that
that
is
indeed
what
your
position
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
you
don't
insist
that
he
come
in
on
his
own.
he
may
well
be
able
to
find
counsel.
he
can
say
look,
all
you
have
to
do
is
file
a
well-pleaded
complaint
for
me.
i
don't
want
you
to
try
the
whole
habeas
matter.
i
don't
even
want
you
to
do
all
the
investigation.
all
i
have
to
do
is
make
out
a
solid
federal
claim,
then
i'll
get
free
federal
counsel.
it
would
make
it
a
lot
easier
to
get
a
state-appointed
counsel
if
you
knew
that
all
that
person
is
committed
to
is
getting
the
foot
in
the
door,
whereupon
the
federal
system
will
take
over
and
you'll
get
another
counsel.
isn't
that
a
plausible
scenario?
unknown
speaker
so
congress
can
be
relying
on
state-provided
free
legal
services
to
get
the
foot
in
the
door,
and
once
the
foot
is
in
the
door,
the
federal
funding
will
take
over.
that
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
reasonable
disposition.
well,
does
the
state
finance
these
things?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
they
didn't
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
there's
no
state
agency
or
defense
agency
that
maintains
a
list
of
lawyers
who
are
willing
to
file
well-pleaded
complaints
for
free.
unknown
speaker
are
there
enough
of
them
to
represent
all
of
these
people
to
get
their
well-pleaded
complaints
in?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know
how
many
there
are.
unknown
speaker
in
the
gosch
case,
it
was
the
district
judge
who
decided
to
rule
on
the
petition,
it
wasn't
the
state
that
asked
for
it,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
--did
it
on
his
own.
unknown
speaker
was
it
the
same
district
judge
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
griffey.
ms.
welch,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
therefore
you
didn't
ask...
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you
for
that
clarification.
that's
what
i--
