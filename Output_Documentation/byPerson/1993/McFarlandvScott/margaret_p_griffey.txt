ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mcfarland
asks
the
court
to
disregard
the
plain
meaning
of
2251
and
amend
the
express
limitations
enacted
by
congress
in
order
to
allow
a
stay
of
execution
to
be
entered
whenever
a
death
sentence
inmate
approaches
the
federal
court
claiming
to
be
without
the
assistance
of
counsel.
in
asking
the
court
to
validate
his
misconstruction
of
statutory
authority,
mcfarland
seeks
to
effectively
overturn
the
limitations
of
constitutional
review
recognized
in
mccleskey
v.
zant,
and
to
indirectly
overturn
the
limitations
of
coleman,
giarrantano,
and
finley.
mcfarland
complains
that
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
effectively
foreclosed
federal
habeas
review
because
under
the
fifth
circuit's
analysis
a
petitioner
is
unable
to
obtain
a
stay,
an
appointment
of
counsel,
without
first
filing
an
application,
but
is
unable
to
file
an
application
without
first
obtaining
the
assistance
of
counsel
in
a
stay.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
no.
848(q)(4)(b)--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--i
think
it
is
not
open
to
that
interpretation.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
one
did.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
the
amicus
of
the
criminal
justice
legal
foundation
took
the
position
that
counsel
could
be
appointed
beforehand.
however,
it
is
clear--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--that
is
not
what
congress
provided
for.
there
is
a
specific
provision,
848(q)(4)(b),
that
refers
to
a
habeas
proceeding,
or
a
post
conviction
proceeding
under
2254.
2254
is
explicitly
conditioned
on
there
being
an
application
on
the
ground
that
custody
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
laws,
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.
the
general
provisions
contained
in
subsection
(q)(4)(a)
and
the
following
provisions
are
merely
general
provisions
and
do
not
prevail
over
the
specific
provision,
or
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
that
specific
provision.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i
think
that
is
entirely
within
the
court's
discretion.
what
is
not
within
the
court's
discretion
is
the
basis
upon...
whether
a
state--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--i
think
if
there
is
a
petition
before
the
court
that
raises
constitutional
basis
for
relief,
then
under
848(q),
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
appointment
of
counsel,
but
he
may
not
be
entitled
to
the
appointment
of...
to
the
stay
of
execution
unless
he
raises
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
federal
right
upon
which
relief
might
be
granted.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
under
rules
2
and
rules
3
and
2242,
yes,
it
does,
otherwise
the
district
clerk
of
the
court
is
entitled
to
not
file
that
petition.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
or
application,
yes.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
that
is
what
congress
wrote.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i
think
you
have
to
judge
what
congress
intended
by
the
language
that
is
in
that
statute,
and
it
refers
to
a
post
conviction
proceeding
under
2254.
congress
could
have
provided
for
the
prepetition
appointment
of
counsel.
it
could
have
provided
for
a
stay
to
allow
the
appointment
of
counsel
prior
to
the
formulation
of
an
application
and
petition,
sufficient
time,
under
whatever
standard
congress
found,
to
prepare
that
application
and
petition,
but
nonetheless,
congress
didn't
do
that.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
not
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
the
initial
pleading.
once
a
petition
has
been
filed
raising
error
of
constitutional
dimension,
then
he
is
entitled
to
the
appointment
of
counsel,
and
he
is
also
entitled
to
file
an
amended
pleading.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
no.
a
proceeding
is--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--if
it
comes
after
the
filing
of
an--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--it
is
incidental
to
the
proceeding,
such
as
a
hearing
would
be,
or
any
of
the
other
rules
pertaining
to
federal
habeas
review
that--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--if
congress
intended
to
do
that,
they
did
not
do
that,
and
it
is
a
well-established
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
the
court
will
not
provide
what
congress
intended
to
do
but
presumably
by
one
theory
or
another
omitted
by
inadvertence.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
the
only
way
that
848(q)
is
turned
into
procedural
farce
by...
under
that
scenario
would
be
if
the
petitioner
waits
until
the
last
minute
to
file
whatever
it
is--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--there
is
no
abuse
of
discretion
there.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
848(q)
could...
the
protection
that
would
be
given
to
a
defendant
under
those
circumstances
would
be,
needless
to
say,
if
they
came
in
at
the
last
minute--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--yes,
i
am
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
848(q)
right
to
counsel
is
conditioned
upon
a
2254,
or
actually
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
defined
by
title
28,
chapter
153,
and
all
the
statutory
provisions
therein
all
of
which
uniformly
require
a
petition
or
an
application
to
be
pending,
and
incidentally,
none
of
which
address
any
prepetitioner
application
stay
of
the
proceeding.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
yes,
that
can
happen,
but
underlying
all
this
concern
is
the
assumption
that
federal
habeas
review
is
somehow
indispensable
to
the
state's
valid
imposition
of
a
death
sentence,
and
it
simply
is
not.
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
of
federal
habeas
review
or
of
counsel
in
federal
habeas
review.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i
don't
remember
exactly
how
it
was
delineated
there.
i
believe
it
was.
we...
our
office
does
not
oppose
a
stay
of
execution
if
anything
is
filed
that
can
reasonably...
and
we're
talking
reasonably
as
if
it
were
almost
a
pro
se
petition,
or
was
a
pro
se
petition
filed,
that
can
be
construed
as
a
habeas
application.
so,
for
example,
when
something
is
filed
saying,
i
want
a
stay,
and
here's
four
potential
grounds
for
relief,
we
will
say,
if
the
court
should--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--that's
correct.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
that
changed...
that
was
not
the
procedure
that
was
followed
in
gosch.
i
can't
say
that
that
has
all
changed.
it
is
still
our
office's
position,
and
most
of
the
courts
are
continuing
to
act
in
that
manner,
of
allowing
time
to
file
amended
petitions
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
i
also
would
like
to
point
out--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--that--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--that
was
his
risk
in
federal
court,
but
underlying
mcfarland's
claims
here
is
the
assumption
that
somehow
the
procedure
fell
down
in
the
first
instance
in
the
texas
courts
because
texas
does
not
routinely
and
regularly
with
a
uniform
procedure
provide
for
the
appointment
of
counsel.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
habeas
jurisdiction
is
conditioned
upon
there
being
errors
of
constitutional
dimension
identified,
and
the
factual
support
for
those
set
forth
in
an
application,
and
congress
has
not
changed
its
delineation
of
a
federal
habeas
proceeding.
as
a
practical--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--there
are
several
underlying
assumptions
here
that
need
to
be
addressed.
first
of
all,
if
it
was
known
4
months,
3
months
in
advance
that
the
resource
center
was
going
to
be
unable
to
recruit
counsel,
petitioner
should
have
been
and
maybe
was
advised
of
that
fact.
there
still
exists
in
texas
the
inmate
legal
services
legal
group
that
will
provide
representation
for
all
indigent
non-fee-producing
cases.
that
organization
has
not
been
utilized
since
the
advent
of
the
texas
resource
center,
but
it
nonetheless
continues
to
exist.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
you're
correct,
it
doesn't,
and
the
equitable
concerns
seem
to
have
come
in
in
this
case,
although
they
should
not
come
in,
in
terms
of
analyzing
whether
jurisdiction
should
be
found
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
this
case
is
strictly
controlled
by
2251.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
no.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
that
period
of
delay
is
not
at
all
unusual.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
it
can
vary
anywhere
from
2
years
to
8
years.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
well,
it
was
not
just
a
matter
of
2
or
3
weeks
to
get
a
lawyer.
in
this
case
they
had
at
least
4
months
following
the
denial
of
certiorari
review
to
get
an
attorney.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
texas
is
well
aware
of
that
fact,
and
in
fact
in
the
1993
legislative
session
tried
to
amend
our
habeas
procedure
to
provide
for
the
regular
and
routine
appointment,
to
provide
for
filing
deadlines
that
would
not
necessity
setting
execution
dates
to
compel
state
litigation
to
go--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--in
this
particular
case,
i
can't
speak
to
specifics,
but
i
do
know
that
it
frequently
takes
a
year
to
get
the
record
on
appeal
compiled,
that
the
direct
appeal
may
raise
20,
25
claims,
so
that
the
briefing
on
each
side
goes
way
outside
the
normal
statutorily
prescribed
limits
for
filing
the
briefs
on
each
side.
the--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--it
has
been
my
experience
in
watching
a
number
of
capital
cases
go
through
that.
that
period
of
time
is
not
unusual
on
direct
appeal,
nor
is
that
period
of
time
at
all
unusual
for
a
case
to
be
pending
before
a
federal
district
court.
the
issue
here
is
how
to
make
the
petitioner
proceed
in
an
orderly
fashion
from
one
stage
of
litigation
to
another.
sometimes
these
cases
raise
complex
issues
that
require
extended
review.
the
period
of
time
in
between
should
not
be
one
that
is
simply
used
to
sit
there
and
say,
i
don't
have
counsel.
it
should
be
used
for
the
preparation
of
a
petition,
and
texas
tried
to
provide
for
the
regular,
routine
appointment
of
counsel
and
for
the...
a
series
of
filing
dates
that
did
not
require
execution
dates
to
be
set,
and
that
provision
was
defeated
by
the
very
people
who
are
now
lobbying,
or
the
very
people
who
are
now
representing
mcfarland
in
this
court,
and
by
the
lobbying
of
some
of
the
groups
who
have
appeared
as
amicus
in
this
case.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
it
got
through
the
texas
house,
and
did
not
get
passed
in
the
texas
senate.
it
will
be
reintroduced.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
there
could
have
been.
it
has
been
my
experience
that
while
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
a
desired
feature
by
the
defense
bar,
that
an
abuse
doctrine
is
not.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
at
trial?
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i'm
afraid
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
yes,
they
are.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
as
the
court
recognized,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
properly
one
of
jurisdiction,
not
of
the
equitable
concerns
here.
under
conway,
an
action
is
not
pending
until
it
is
commenced
by
the
filing
of
the
initial
designated
pleading.
while
civil
actions
are
commenced
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint,
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
commenced
by
the
filing
of
an
application
or
petition
in
which
available
grounds
for
relief
are
identified
and
the
factual
support
for
each
ground
is
set
forth.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
yes.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
the
understanding
that
a
habeas
application
is
commenced
by
the
filing
of
an
application
or
petition
raising
constitutional
bases
for
relief
is
consistent
with
the
court's
conclusion
in
barefoot
v.
estelle
that
a
stay
can
only
be
entered
if
there
is
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
federal
right
upon
which
relief
might
be
granted.
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
jurisdictional
concerns
expressed
by
the
court
in
disposing
of
petitions
filed
by
next
friends,
and
finally,
it
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
habeas
corpus
statutes.
in
1908,
congress
attempted
to
eliminate
the
delay
in
the
carrying
out
of
state
executions
attributable
to
frivolous
appeals
by
enacting
the
cpc
requirement,
and
in
1934,
congress
eliminated
the
provision
for
automatic
stays.
the
provisions
of
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
contained
at
848(q)
do
not
authorize
the
prepetition
stays
of
execution.
848(q)
does
not
expand
the
scope
or
meaning
of
the
term,
proceeding,
as
used
in
2251,
nor
does
848(q)
constitute
an
expressly
authorized
exception
to
the
prohibition
of
the
anti-injunction
act
under
the
analysis
of
mitchum
v.
foster.
both
the
provisions,
as
we...
as
i
stated
earlier--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--that
is
correct.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
the
critical
point
of
my
argument
is
that
he's
not
entitled
to
a
stay
while
he
finds
counsel.
he
must
have
a
constitutional
basis
for
relief.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i
disagree
only
that
i
believe
that
he
can
file
an
adequate
complaint
without
the
assistance
of
counsel.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
yes,
and
in
fact
in
this
case
tarrant
county
district
attorney's
office
said,
file
a
petition
of
any
sort.
we
will
not
oppose
a
stay
or
modification
of
execution
date,
and
the
circumstances
that
existed
in
gosch
did
not
prevent
mcfarland
in
the
state
courts
from
filing
a
perfunctory
petition
and
from
filing
an
amended
position.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
the
state
habeas
actions?
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
in
some...
they
have
the
authority
to.
they
do
not
have
the
obligation
to.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
no.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
there
is
no...
there
is
no
state
agency
that
maintains
that
list.
there
is
a
staff
counsel
for
inmates
that
if
they
are
requested
to
represent
a
death
sentence
inmate
who
is
indigent
will
do
so.
there
is
also
the
texas
resource
center.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i
do
not
know
the
size
of
their
staff.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
no.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
that
is
correct.
the
district
judge--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--right.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
no.
no,
and
in
fact
in
another
case
in
texas
that
immediately
followed
this
one,
there
was
a
suggestion
from
the
district
judge
that
they
file
a
perfunctory
petition
with
a
request
to
be...
for
leave
to
file
an
amended
petition,
and
that
was
not
followed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
i
will--
