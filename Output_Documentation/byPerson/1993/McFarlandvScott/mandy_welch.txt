ms.
mandy
welch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
frank
mcfarland
asked
the
district
court
to
appoint
him
a
lawyer
and
to
stay
his
execution
long
enough
so
that
that
lawyer
could
do
what
was
proper
and
necessary
to
prepare
and
file
mr.
mcfarland's
first
federal
habeas
corpus
petition.
the
respondents
took
the
position--
ms.
mandy
welch
--he
made
the
request
on
october
22nd,
justice
scalia.
ms.
mandy
welch
it
was
denied
june
6th,
so
it
was
approximately
4
months,
4-1/2
months.
ms.
mandy
welch
well,
i'm
sure
that
mr.
mcfarland
worried
about
the
counsel
problem
the
entire
period
of
time,
your
honor.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
sir,
we
worried
a
great
deal
about
it.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
your
honor.
we
took
the
position
and
have
taken
the
position
that
we
should
do
everything
we
can
in
order
to
get
counsel
for
unrepresented
death
row
inmates
in
texas
for
state
court
proceedings
before
we
resort
to
the
provisions
in
federal
court.
ms.
mandy
welch
your
honor,
we
did
see
the
problem
arising,
and
we
were
worried
about
the
problem.
we
were
worried
about
the
problem
with
respect
to
approximately
65
people
in
texas'--
ms.
mandy
welch
--at
this
time,
your
honor,
we
have
18,
and
there
are
376
people
on
death
row.
we
are
involved
in
at
least
220
cases
in
which
people
are...
in
which
those
prisoners
are
seeking
relief
in
any
state
and
federal
court.
ms.
mandy
welch
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not
wait
until
5
days
before.
we
did
not
intend
to
wait
until
5
days
before
the
execution
date.
at
that
point,
there
was
a
request
pending
in
state
court
and
we
were
expecting
and
hoping
the
state
court
would
grant
an
extension,
or
would
grant
a
modification,
and
that
going
to
federal
court
would
be
necessary.
it
was
not
something
we
wanted
to
happen,
your
honor.
ms.
mandy
welch
no.
ms.
mandy
welch
the
texas
resource
center,
or
the
lawyers
at
the
texas
resource
center
consider
the
recruitment
of
counsel
for
people
on
death
row
to
be
an
enormous
and
important
responsibility.
what
we
are
here
today
for--
ms.
mandy
welch
--your
honor,
we
do
come
in
at
the
last
minute
if
the
last
minute
is...
if
you're
talking
about
shortly
before
an
execution
date,
but
we
try
to
come
in
earlier.
in
mr.
mcfarland's
case,
the
execution
date
was
set
without
notice
to
us.
we
learned
about
it
when
mr.
mcfarland
wrote
us
and
asked
us
to
continue
helping
him
recruit
a
lawyer.
when...
during
the
month
of
september,
and
it's...
it
may
look
to
an
outsider
who
is
only
thinking
about
frank
mcfarland's
case
as
though
we
were
sitting
around
during
july,
august,
and
september,
with
mr.
mcfarland's
agreement,
waiting
for
an
execution
date
to
be
set
so
that
we
could
put
into
play
the
circus
that
goes
on
down
there.
that
is
not
what
we
were
doing,
your
honor.
i
assure
you,
that
is
not
what
we
were
doing.
in
the
month
of
september,
the
month
in
which
mr.
mcfarland's
execution
date
was
set,
there
were
10
executions.
seven
of
the
people
who
were
scheduled
for
execution,
your
honor,
did
not
have
lawyers.
in
august,
there
were...
i
think
there
were
six
executions,
and
our
lawyers
were
involved
in
most
of
those
cases.
on
september
3rd--
ms.
mandy
welch
--i
can't
remember
if
some
of
those
lawyers...
one
or
two
has
come
on
since
then,
your
honor.
of
those
18
lawyers...
and
this
is
important,
although...
although
it
is
just
piece
of
a
really
big
picture.
of
those
lawyers,
five
have
less
than
2
years
experience,
and
only
five
have
more
than
5
years
experience.
ms.
mandy
welch
i
understand,
your
honor.
ms.
mandy
welch
respondent
took
the
position
in
the
court
below
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
matter
because
frank
mcfarland
had
not
yet
filed
a
legally
sufficient
habeas
petition.
the
lower
courts
agreed
and
denied
a
stay.
in
this
court,
respondent
argues
that
while
a
federal
court
may
have
authority
to
appoint
counsel
before
the
filing
of
a
petition
under
these
circumstances,
there
is
an
absolute
jurisdictional
bar
that
prevents
that
court
from
keeping
the
prisoner
alive.
ms.
mandy
welch
no.
he
had
only
filed
a
motion
requesting
appointment
of
counsel,
notifying
the
court
that
he
was
a
state
prisoner
under
sentence
of
death,
that
he
did
want
to
seek
relief
under
2254,
and
that
he
needed
a
lawyer
under...
that
he
needed
a
lawyer
to
prepare
a
petition
in
order
to
seek
that
relief.
he
specifically
asked
for
the
lawyer
under--
ms.
mandy
welch
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
he
asked
for
a
stay
in
order
to
have
a
lawyer
appointed,
and
so
that
that
lawyer
could
do
what
was
necessary
to
file
the
petition
that
was
needed
under
the
state's
position
to
invoke
the
court's
jurisdiction.
ms.
mandy
welch
that's
not...
i
mean,
the
court
did
not
obtain
counsel.
what
happened
is
the
counsel
that...
danny
burns
was
the
lawyer
that
did
end
up
filing
a
petition.
he
called
us
that
afternoon
and
told
us
that
he
had
gotten
a
call
from
the
federal
magistrate
asking
him
if
he
would
accept
an
appointment
in
this
case,
and
he
was
calling
to
find
out
about
the
case
in
order
to
try
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
was
in
a
position
to
accept
an
appointment.
ms.
mandy
welch
he
did.
he
was
never
appointed,
and
in
fact
he
was
never
contacted
by
the
judge.
ms.
mandy
welch
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mandy
welch
well,
this
court
issued
a
stay
at
the
same
time
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
lower...
from
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit's
denial
of
the
appointment
of
counsel
and
stay
motion
in
the
first
proceeding.
those
are
two
separate
proceedings.
they
were
filed
at
the
insistence
of
the
court
clerk,
i
believe,
in
the
federal
court,
under
two
separate
case
numbers,
and
there
were
two
stays
that
were
simultaneously
granted.
no
one
disputes...
no
one
before
this
court
disputes
that
when
congress
enacted
848
it
intended
to
authorize
and
require
district
courts
to
appoint
counsel
to
assist
with
the
preparation
and
filing
of
a
habeas
petition,
and
there
is
good
reason
why
no
one
disputes
that,
and
in
fact
the
respondent's
amicus
criminal
justice
legal
foundation
explicitly
adopts
that
interpretation
of
848.
they
know--
ms.
mandy
welch
--you're
right,
justice
o'connor,
it's
not
agreed
that
they
concede
it.
they
don't
dispute
it.
they
have
said,
in
the
event,
if
the
court
determines,
they
have
really
not
taken
a
position
on
it
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
we
definitely
do,
and
as
the
criminal
justice
legal
foundation's
brief
indicates,
they
explicitly
agree
that
848
authorizes
the
prepetition
appointment
of
counsel,
and
in
fact--
ms.
mandy
welch
--no,
and
in
paragraph...
i
can't
find
it.
i
thought
i
had
it
here,
but
in
paragraph
(8)
under
that
provision,
the
court
indicates
that
counsel
appointed
in
accordance
with
those
provisions
shall
do
whatever
is
necessary,
including
six
stays
of
execution,
and
it
refers
to
the
post
conviction
process,
and
it
uses
language
that
suggests
that
counsel
is
intended
to
be
available
at
all
critical
stages.
ms.
mandy
welch
they
did
not...
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
specifically
address
the
right
to
counsel,
but
the
district
court
specifically
refused
to
appoint
counsel,
apparently
relying
upon
the
jurisdictional
bar
that
respondents
urge.
ms.
mandy
welch
i
think
that
that
would
just...
yes,
justice
souter,
i
think
that
would
certainly
address
the
problem
that
frank
mcfarland
was
faced
with
and
that
is
being
presented
to
the
court,
but
only
if
it
is
clear
to
the
inmate
that
an
insufficient
petition
does
not
invoke
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
insofar
as
it
requires
the
barefoot
standard
to
be
met.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
justice
souter,
but
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
barefoot
paid
a
lot
of
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
that
case
he
had
had
competent
counsel
throughout
the
proceedings,
and
to
some
extent
both
the
fifth
circuit
and
this
court
relied
upon
that
in
approving
the
standards
that
have
since
become
the--
ms.
mandy
welch
--i
absolutely
agree
with
you,
justice
souter.
i
do
think
that
there
could
be
circumstances
where
someone
files
a
piece
of
paper
asking
for
counsel
and
attempts
to
prepare
what
would
be
considered
a
petition,
but
the
court
might
find
that
it's
not
a
petition,
and
in
those
circumstances
i
think
that
the
all
writs
act
would
provide
a
habeas
court
with
the
necessary
authority
to
issue
a
stay
to
protect
its
jurisdiction
over--
ms.
mandy
welch
--yes,
your
honor,
but
congress
also
recognized
that
in
order
for
a
death
row
inmate
to
articulate
an
error
sufficiently
to
benefit
from
habeas
corpus
review,
a
lawyer
is
necessary.
ms.
mandy
welch
your
honor,
i
do
think
that
that
is
what
congress
said,
that
a
lawyer
is
required
in
order
to
assist
a
death
row
inmate
in
identifying
those
claims
which
must
be
reviewed
by
habeas
corpus
in
order
to
provide
an
effective
remedy
for
people
who
are
sentenced
to
death
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
ms.
mandy
welch
i
think
that
it
could
conflict
with
rule
4
if
rule
4
is
construed
as
an
absolute,
automatic
bar
to
proceeding,
but
that
is
not
what
rule
4
is,
nor
what
it
was
intended.
while
the
court
might
have
discretion
under
some
circumstances
to
do
that,
i
think
that
848
makes
it
clear
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
that
discretion,
as
justice
souter
indicated,
if
that
were
done
in
a
case...
in
a
death
case
without
counsel.
ms.
mandy
welch
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
determine
from
that
pleading
whether
or
not
someone
is
clearly
entitled,
or
clearly
not
entitled.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
rule
should
be
that
the
court
is
not
committed
to
determine
from
an
uncounseled
petition
that--
ms.
mandy
welch
--no.
i
would--
ms.
mandy
welch
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
when
congress
passed
848
it
make
an
absolute
determination
that
counsel
is
required
in
every
capital
case.
it
has
not
made
that
determination
with
regard
to
other
habeas
provisions.
that
would
have
to
be
addressed--
ms.
mandy
welch
--but
that
is
because
of
the
intent
expressed
by
congress
in
848.
there
are
counsel
provisions
that
are
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
when
the
interests
appear
to
require
appointment
of
counsel
under
the
criminal
justice
act,
but
i
think
that
what
congress
did
in
848
is
enact
an
unrebuttable
presumption
that
the
interests
of
justice
requires
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
all
capital
cases.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's--
ms.
mandy
welch
--yes,
but
if
you
take
into
account
the
need
for
a
lawyer,
and
the
difference
between
the
right
to
a
lawyer,
the
discretionary
right
to
a
lawyer
under
3006a
and
that
mandatory
right
to
a
lawyer
under
848,
it
makes
no
sense
to
create
a
situation
where
a
pro
se
habeas
petitioner
would
go
into
court,
ask
for
a
lawyer,
be
executed
because
his
petition
was
inadequate,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
he
had
any
claims
that
a
lawyer
could
have
presented
and
obtained
relief
on.
that
makes
no
sense.
ms.
mandy
welch
that
case
involved
issuing
of...
is
it
issuing
of
subpoenas?
anyway--
ms.
mandy
welch
--right.
that...
in
that
case,
there
was
a
specific
statute
that
dealt
with
the
specific
thing
that
was
before
the
court.
in
this
case--
ms.
mandy
welch
--there
is
a
specific
statute
dealing
with
stays,
and
if
you
interpret
it
as
we
do,
it
gives
the
court
jurisdiction
when
a
request
for
counsel
is
filed.
if
you
interpret
it
as
the
state
does
and
limit
its
application
to
that
period
of
time
after
a
petition
is
filed,
then
there
is
nothing...
it
is
void.
there's
a
void.
there's
a
blank
for
that
period
of
time
when
uncounseled
petitioner
is
seeking
his
rights
under
848,
and
so
you
have
a
totally
different
situation.
ms.
mandy
welch
your
honor,
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
stay
an
execution--
ms.
mandy
welch
--when
it's
necessary
in
order
to
appoint
counsel
and
protect
its
habeas
review
over
claims
that
are
then
presented
in
a
counsel
petition.
ms.
mandy
welch
i
don't
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
to
read
the
stay
provisions
into
848.
the
stay
provisions
are
within
the
all
writs
act,
which
authorizes
the
federal
habeas
court
to
issue
a
writ
or
other
orders
when
it
is
necessary
to
protect
its
prospective
jurisdiction
over
a
state
conviction
and
death
sentence.
ms.
mandy
welch
your
honor--
ms.
mandy
welch
--there
may
be
circumstances
where
a
death
row
inmate
so
abuses
the
process
and
so
toys
with
the
court
and
so
ignores
available
processes
that
it
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
a
stay
or
to
deny
counsel,
but
those
issues
are
not
before
this
court.
ms.
mandy
welch
it's...
because
of
the
uncertainty
about
the
provisions,
your
honor,
it
is
really
difficult
for
me
to
say.
we
had
always
approached
the
right
to--
ms.
mandy
welch
--after
the
state
court
refused
to
appoint
counsel,
or
after
this,
and
also
refused
to
allow
additional
time
for
other
measures
to
be
taken
that
might
have
provided
counsel.
ms.
mandy
welch
that
was
october
22nd,
when
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
denied
our
request
to
order
the
state
court
to
appoint
counsel.
ms.
mandy
welch
well,
that
was
the
position
that
we
had
taken
that
we
should
pursue
all
available
state
remedies
for
counsel.
ms.
mandy
welch
no.
we
asked
the
state
court
to
appoint
counsel
in...
well,
we
went
before
the
state
court
in
september,
and
the
judge
was
not
there,
and
the
judge
modified
the
date
so
that
we
could
come
back
before
the
actual
trial
judge,
and
there
was
pending
before
that
judge
a
request
for
assistance,
for
time
to
recruit
counsel.
that
judge
took
the
position
that
texas
law
did
not
authorize
him
to
appoint
counsel,
and
we...
and
so
we
were
trying
to
persuade
that
judge
to
give
us
enough
time
to
recruit
volunteer
counsel,
but
that
judge
said
explicitly
to
me
over
the
telephone,
with
the
district
attorney
on
the
phone,
i
do
not
interpret
texas
law
as
even
allowing
me
to
appoint
counsel,
so
i'm
not
going
to
do
it.
ms.
mandy
welch
that
is...
no.
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
mr.
mcfarland
did
ask
for
counsel
in
september,
and
that
request
was
held
over
when
another
judge
modified
the
execution
date
until
october.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
ms.
mandy
welch
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
want
to
correct
something
that
i
said
in
response
to
a
question
that
justice
scalia
asked.
we
did
not
specifically
request
in
our
letter
to...
the
state
court
did
not
request
appointment
of
counsel.
we
asked
that
we
be
allowed
time
to
recruit
volunteer
counsel.
there
was
a
pro
se
motion
that
was
presented
to
the
judge
requesting
a
stay
and
time
to
obtain
counsel,
but
i
don't...
that
is
not
in
the
record,
and
i
don't
believe
it
specifically
asked
for
appointment.
the
appointment
system
in
texas
is...
really
varies
on
a
county-by-county
basis.
nowhere
in
texas
does
the
state
provide
funds
for
indigent
defendants,
either
at
the
trial
level
or
at
the
postconviction
habeas
level.
all
of
that
is
done
by
counties,
and
some
judges
take
the
position
that
they
do
not
have
the
authority
to
provide
counsel
in
habeas,
and
that
was
the
position
of
the
judge
in
this
case.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mandy
welch
oh,
and
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
problem
that
was
created
by
the
absence
of
any
rules
or
procedures
in
state
court.
we
were
faced
with
the
same
dilemma
in
state
court
that
we
were
faced
with
in
federal
court.
the
district
attorney,
just
like
the
attorney
general's
office,
did
agree
not
to
oppose
a
stay
if
mr.
mcfarland
filed
a
perfunctory
petition,
but
the
judge
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
would
not
allow
time
for
counsel
to
be
recruited
in
order
to
amend
that
petition.
he
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
would
not
appoint
counsel
to
represent
mr.
mcfarland
on
that
petition,
and
when
it
was
explained
to
him
that
we
could
not,
unless
we
had
additional
time,
he
made
it
quite
clear
that
we
would
not
be
allowed
to
substitute
counsel
even
if
volunteer
counsel
was
found.
so
it
is
not
quite
so
simple
to
say
that
they
agreed
not
to
oppose
a
stay,
just
as
the
attorney
general's
office
agreed
not
to
oppose
a
stay.
they
were
unable
to
agree...
they
were
unable
to
assure
us
in
any
way
that
the
judge
would
appoint
counsel,
and
in
fact
the
judge
said
he
would
not.
ms.
mandy
welch
thank
you.
