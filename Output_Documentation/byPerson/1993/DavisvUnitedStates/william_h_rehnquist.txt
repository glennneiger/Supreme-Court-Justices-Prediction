chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
second
of
the
two
opinions
i
have
to
announce
is
92-1949,
davis
against
the
united
states.
and
here,
petitioner,
davis,
is
a
member
of
the
united
states
navy.
a
serviceman
was
murdered
on
the
charleston
navy
base
and
the
investigation
by
the
nis,
the
naval
investigative
service,
gradually
focused
on
petitioner.
after
being
advised
of
his
rights
to
remain
silent
and
to
counsel,
he
agreed
to
talk
with
nis
agents.
about
an-hour-and-a-half
into
the
interview,
he
said
"maybe
i
should
talk
to
a
lawyer."
the
agents
asked
him
whether
he
was
asking
for
a
lawyer
or
just
making
a
comment
about
a
lawyer,
and
he
said
"no,
i
am
not
asking
for
a
lawyer",
and,
"no,
i
do
not
want
a
lawyer."
the
agents
then
continued
questioning
him.
the
trial
court
declined
to
suppress
the
incriminating
statements
he
made
during
the
interview
finding
that
he
had
not
requested
counsel
and
that
the
agents
properly
determine
that
he
was
not
indicating
a
desire
to
have
an
attorney
present.
he
was
convicted
of
murder
and
the
military
appellate
court
upheld
his
conviction.
we
granted
certiorari
in
the
case
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
state
and
federal
courts
with
respect
to
how
law
enforcement
officers
should
respond
to
the
suspect's
ambiguous
or
equivocal
request
for
counsel.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
and
authored
by
justice
o'connor,
we
affirm
the
judgment
below.
in
our
miranda
decision
back
in
1966,
we
held
that
a
suspect
is
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
during
custodial
interrogation
even
though
the
constitution
does
not
provide
for
such
assistance.
in
our
1981
edwards
decision,
we
held
that
if
the
suspect
invokes
the
right
to
counsel
anytime
the
policeman
immediately
seize
questioning
until
an
attorney
is
present.
but
we
are
unwilling
to
create
a
third
layer
of
prophylaxis
to
prevent
police
questioning
when
the
suspect
might
want
a
lawyer.
unless
the
suspect
actually
requests
an
attorney
by
making
a
statement
that
a
reasonable
officer
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
would
understand
to
be
an
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel
questioning
may
continue.
the
courts
below
found
that
petitioner's
remark
to
the
nis
agent
"maybe
i
should
talk
to
a
lawyer"
was
not
a
request
for
counsel
and
we
so
no
reason
to
disturb
that
conclusion.
the
nis
agents,
therefore,
were
not
required
to
stop
questioning
petitioner
though
it
was
entirely
proper
for
them
if
they
wished
to
clarify
whether
he
wanted
a
lawyer.
accordingly,
there
is
no
ground
for
suppression
of
petitioner's
statements
and
the
judgments
of
the
lower
courts
are
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
blackmun,
stevens,
ginsburg
join.
