well,
mr.
mann,
i
think,
you
know,
it's
pretty
easy
to
conclude
that
reasonably
equivalent
value
means
something
other
than
market
value,
but
does
it
also
mean,
we
accept
as
a
per
se
rule
that
a
foreclosure
sale
yields
reasonably
equivalent
value,
or
is
it
a
case...
is
it
open
to
a
case-by-case
inquiry,
or
is
it
only
a
presumption?
the
cases
are
all
over
the
ball
park
in
how
to
deal
with
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
had
been
a
private
sale
and
not
a
foreclosure
sale.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
your
rule
play
out
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
other
words,
to
help
me
out,
you
would
not
make
the
same
argument
as
applied
to
a
voluntary
sale?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
excuse
me,
mr.
sment,
i
think
we're
here
today
to
interpret
the
federal
bankruptcy
statute
and
determine
what
that
language
means.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
why
do
you
need
a
per
se
rule
if
you
want
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
sale?
