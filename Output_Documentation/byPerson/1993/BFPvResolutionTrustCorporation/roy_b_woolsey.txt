mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
mr.
chief
justice,
justices,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
court
ruled
that
in
the
cases
where
there
is
no
fraud
or
collusion
in
a
foreclosure
sale,
the
high
bid
irrebuttably
presumes...
is
presumed
to
be,
irrebuttably,
the
reasonably
equivalent
value.
this
proposition,
your
honors,
is
preposterous.
we
must
look
at
actual
values
and
compare
them.
now,
counsel
have
agreed
with
me
on
interpretation
of
statutes
that
we
first
look
to
the
statute.
there,
our
agreement
ends,
however.
from
there
on,
we
disagree
violently.
i
say
that
section
548(a)(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
uses
the
language,
and
i
quote,
omitting
a
few
irrelevant
words,
"the
trustee
may
avoid
any
transfer
of
an
interest
of
debtor
in
property
if
the
debtor
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
received
less
than
the
reasonably
equivalent
value
and
the
transfer
occurred
in
the
year
before
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy.
"
now,
equivalent
value
has
got
to
mean
equal
value...
equivalent
means
equal.
we're
not
talking
about
a
peppercorn
that
would
support...
as
consideration,
support
a
contract.
we're
talking
about
a
comparison
of
values.
the
only
way
you
can
compare--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--pardon
me.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
oh,
under
550
of
the
united
states
code,
under
the
bankruptcy
code
we
are
entitled
either
to
rescind,
which
we
can't
do
because
it's
gone
to
innocent
third-party
transferees,
or
recover
the
value
of
the
property.
in
this
case,
the
recovery
i
think
would
be
limited
to
the
difference
between
what
the
buyers
put
into
the
property
and
what
they
got
out
of
it
on
their
resale.
if
they
hadn't
resold
and
we
were
to
avoid
the
transfer
and
get
it
back
into
the
estate
of
the
bankruptcy,
then,
of
course,
they
would
have
a
lien
for
their
expenditures
on
the
property.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
well,
from
osborne
and
the
other
buyers
we
are
entitled
to
that.
now,
from
the
imperial
savings
and
loan
we
have
a
different
matter.
they
were
the
holding
company
that
held
the
trustee
under
the
deed
of
trust,
and
they
benefited
by
getting
a
trustee's
fees.
there
may
have
been
other
benefits.
we
didn't
go
into
the
facts
of
the
other
benefits
in
the
case
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
judge
sustained
their
motion
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action,
so
there
was
no
fact
hearing
on
the
measure
of
damages.
the
judge
in
the
bankruptcy
case
that
we
take
the
appeals
from
and
this
cert
is
from
held
that
he
was
bound
by
the
then,
he
thought
in
effect,
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
decision
in
madrid,
the
1981
or
'2
case,
and
he
felt
that
controlled
him.
he
had
written
the
decision
cited
by
my
opponents
in
that
kachanizadeh
case
where
he
said
if
he
had
this
to
decide
initially
he
would
come
to
a
different
result,
but
he
felt
bound
by
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
and
on
that
basis
and
one
other
basis
affirmed...
i
mean--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--pardon--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--the
federal
respondent
would
only
be
to
the
extent
of
the
benefits
to
the
federal
respondent
under
section
550.
they
might
be
limited
to
the
trustee's
fee
that
they
got
part
of.
there
might
be
other
benefits.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
i'm
sure
of
that
against
the
buyers,
and
of
course
if
that
makes
us
whole,
maybe
we
couldn't
get
anything
against
the
imperial
savings.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
thank
you.
now,
in
statute...
in
this
case
where
the
code
says
that
he
can
avoid
any
transfer,
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
type
of
transfer.
it
doesn't
go
into
whether
it's
a
foreclosure
transfer
or
some
other
type
of
transfer.
the
question
is
one
of
comparing
value,
and
equivalent
value
has
got
to
mean
equal
value.
the
word
"reasonably"
before
it
has
to
change
that.
it
modifies
"equivalent",
so
perhaps
it
means
approximately,
or
nearly
equivalent
value,
but
surely
we
have
to
have
that,
or
else
the
sale
can
be
set
aside.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
and
that
guidelines
such
as
that
might
be
appropriate
for
this
court.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
mm-hmm.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
well,
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
has
to
do
with
the
type
of
sale,
i
would
say
that
the
word
"reasonably"
has
modified
"equivalent",
and
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
is
congress
meant
something
like
approximately,
or
nearly,
rather
than
absolutely
equivalent
value.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
that
would
defeat
congress'
intent.
congress
didn't
intend
to
let
a
sale,
no
matter
how
small...
there
are
some
foreclosure
sales
have
gone
for
5
percent
of
value.
it
seems
to
me
we
cannot
say
that
such
a
sale
meets
the
standard
set
forth
in
section
548.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
now,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
the
court
is
asking
if
the
creditor
is
going
to
bid
it
in
and
make
a
gift
back?
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
oh--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--well--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--well,
of
course--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
case.
that
argument
would
destroy
the
application
of
548
to
any
transaction,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
well,
i
think
548
applies
to
foreclosures
as
it
does
any
other
sale,
because
the
foreclosure
market
is
not
a
market
that
is
designed
to
determine
accurate
value,
and
some
of
the
cases
we
cited
say
it
doesn't
evidence
value.
the
foreclosure
price
may
be
any
price.
it
doesn't
relate
to
value,
and
the
congress
has
said,
if
it
doesn't...
if
it
isn't
at
least
the
reasonably
equivalent
value,
it
can
be
set
aside.
reasonably
equivalent
can't
be
based
on
the
transaction
following
state
law.
this
is
based
on
an
act
of
congress
that
has
set
forth
a
federal
statute
and
a
federal
standard.
as
said
in
the
butner
case
in
the
footnotes,
and
said
in
some
of
the
other
cases,
547,
on
prepetition
preferences,
548
on
prepetition
sales,
549
on
postpetition
sales,
all
have
to
meet
a
standard,
and
it's
a
federal
standard,
and
the
state
standard
doesn't
determine
it.
i
don't
think
the
state
standard
here,
the
fact
that
you
comply
with
the
state
standard
doesn't
determine
value.
the
state
has
a
foreclosure
system
in
order
to
protect
a
creditor
who
can
foreclose.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
that
is
true
of
state
systems
characteristically.
i
must
confess,
there's
one
case
cited
by
my
adversary,
the
bank
of
seoul
v.
marcione,
which
held
that
the
trustee
does
have
some
duties
in
that
respect,
and
for
violation
of
that
duty
a
sale
could
be
set
aside
under
state
law,
but
i
don't
think
the
state
law
is
the
test
here.
the
test
here
is
federal
law
and
what
happened
in
this
particular
transaction,
and
in
this
particular
transaction,
a
sale
of
less
than
70
percent
was
not
a
reasonably
equivalent
value,
is
our
position.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
i
don't
think
that
is,
your
honor.
i
think
the
federal
government
has
set
forth
a
standard
that
applies
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
yes.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
no.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
the
primary
consideration
here
is
comparing
this,
equivalent
value...
we're
comparing.
we're
comparing
the
value,
not
the
circumstances.
the
circumstances
are
secondary
to
comparing
the
value.
it
is
true
that
cases
do
dwell
on
the
circumstances...
the
bundles
case,
the--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--well,
i
don't
know
that--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--well,
i
would
rather
the
standard
be
higher
than
the
70
percent.
i
think
the
words
do
mean
that.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
70
percent
will
cover
us
in
this
case.
we're
wiling
to
take
70.
but
i
don't
think
that
means
that
70
percent
is
what
congress
meant,
particularly
when
you
take
into
account
other
circumstances
such
as
that
in
these
sales
we
have
advertising
in
compliance
with
the
state
law
about
a
little
notice,
not
advertising
the
type
of
property--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--well,
many
of
the
cases...
most
of
the
cases
say
we
can
take
into
account--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--well,
i
think
the
circumstances
can
be
considered,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
means
the
type
of
sale.
for
instance,
take
this,
your
honor.
if
a
person
has
1,000
units
of
something
that
a
family
needs
only
one
of,
obviously
we're
talking
about
the
price
level
at
wholesale
rather
than
the
price
level
at
retail.
certainly
the
reasonably
equivalent
value
is
affected
by
the
economic
law
of
supply
and
demand,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
affected
by
the
type
of
sale.
i
think
if
the
sale
is
a
foreclosure
sale
and
the
cases--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
violates
reasonably
equivalent
if
the
value
has
to
be
low.
we
have
a
situation
here--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--i've
got
to
admit
that
it
might
be
relevant,
but
how
persuasive
can
it
be
when
the
sale
price
is
less
than
70
percent?
i
think
that's
my
distinction.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
that
is
certainly
true.
in
548(a)(1)
the...
if
there's
actual
fraud
we
can
set
it
aside,
and
the
other
section
is
a
way
of
setting
it
aside
based
on
the
objective
standard
of
reasonably
equivalent
price
rather
than
having
to
go
into
whether
or
not
there
was
collusion
or
fraud.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
i
didn't
hear
your
honor's
last
comment.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
that's
true.
now,
in
this
matter,
my
adversaries
have
gone
into
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
policies,
and
legislative
history.
i
think
where
a
statute
is
clear,
we
look
at
the
statute.
we
don't
need
to
go
into
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
if
we
do
consider
the
purpose
here,
we've
got
to
consider
this:
548
itself
is
a
way
of
bringing
property
back
into
the
estate
so
that
it
will
be
there
to
be...
so
that
all
other
creditors
can
share
in
it,
and
547
is
a
way
of
bringing
property
back
into
the
estate.
we're
in
a
subsection...
that
is,
subchapter
(3)
of
chapter
5
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
provides
what
the
estate
is.
541
defines
the
estate,
and
gives
you...
all
of
the
property
that
a
person
owns
under
state
law
comes
into
the
estate,
and
then
it
contains
these
avoidance
powers,
and
then
the
bankruptcy
act
itself
has
two
purposes,
of
course,
to
bring
property
in
for
the
creditors,
let
creditors
share
in
the
property,
and
give
the
debtor
a
fresh
start
after
his
discharge
and
have
the
exempt
property.
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
clearly
supported
by,
in
this
case,
having
the
property
brought
back
in
the
estate.
now,
they
talk
about
presumptions.
presumptions
should
exist
only
if
there's
a
logical
nexus
between
the
proven
fact
and
the
presumed
fact.
i've
gone
into
that
in
the
brief,
and
i
don't
have
to
say
much
more
about
it,
but
i
think
here
you
have
a
situation
at
a
foreclosure
sale,
where
some
of
the
courts
that
are
on
my
side
say
there's
no
conclusive
presumption,
say
that
we
get
less
money
at
a
foreclosure
sale
than
at
other
sales,
therefore
we
can
tolerate
less,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
true
at
all.
i
think
that
that
just
proves
that
we
should
look
with
suspicion
on
a
foreclosure
sale.
the
history
of
the
law
they
go
into,
in
'38
the
bankruptcy
act
got
with
it
the
power
to
invalidate
involuntary
transfers.
in
1978
we
changed
to
include--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--pardon.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
well,
that
argument
had
been
considered
by
several
of
the
text
writers,
and
it
is
of
some
concern.
i
think
here,
however,
if
the
person
knows
that
he's
going
to
have
the
sale
set
aside
if
he
bids
less
than
the
reasonably
equivalent
value,
he's
more
likely
to
bid
what
is
a
reasonably
equivalent
value,
particularly
if
the
court
used
guidelines
such
as
in
durrett.
i
think
that
we're
not
going
to
have
a
situation
where
there's
going
to
be
any
calamity.
for
instance,
texas
has
the
rule
that
you
can
set
aside
the
sale.
the
ninth
circuit,
including
california,
does
not.
what
are
real
estate
values
doing
in
texas
today
and
what
are
they
doing
in
california?
they've
been
going
up
in
the
last
few
months
in
texas
and
they
continue
to
go
down
in
california.
there
are
certainly
other
factors
that
are
more
important
in
determining
values
than
the
possibility
that
a
sale
which
results
in
a
windfall
to
the
buyer
could
be
set
aside.
this
statute
comes
into
play
only
when
there's
a
windfall.
it
doesn't
come
into
play
in
most
foreclosure
cases.
in
many
foreclosure
cases,
it
will
come
into
effect,
of
course,
and
it
should.
i
don't
think
there
should
be
any
attempt
to
harmonize
state
law
with
federal
law
in
this
case.
i
think
the
butner
case
made
that
clear,
a
case
by
this
court.
there's
no
financial
calamity,
and
i
think
that
on
the
fairness
issue
in
this
case,
this
is
a
special
case
in
this
one,
because
remember
the
second
deedholder
had
cured
a
prior
default,
said
he
would
cure
the
default
again,
asked
for
notice
of
the
continuances,
and
it
wasn't
give
to
us.
the
debtor
asked
for
notices
of
the
continuances.
they
thought
they
were
going
to
be
informed
as
to
when
the
sale
was,
and
the
only
reason
for
the
delay
in
curing
the
default
was
that
they
didn't
know
about
title
to
the
third
person
not
here
involved,
and
we
won
that
quiet
title
suit.
i
think
i
better
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
unless
there
are
more
questions.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice:
i
think
that
we've
got
to
keep
the
primary
focus
on
the
words,
reasonably
equivalent
value.
we're
comparing
values,
and
the
other
circumstances
play
a
part,
but
not
the
important
part
that
the
first
thing
is
comparing
reasonably
equivalent
values.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
i
said
i
would
settle
for
70
percent,
because
we
would
win
under
that.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
proper
rule.
i
think
that
perhaps
it
should
be--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--no,
it...
no,
reasonably
equivalent
can't
mean
100
percent
of
equivalent
value.
it's
got
to
be
something
different.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
yes,
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
what
that
means
is
difficult,
and
it
leaves
open
for
the
court
a
lot
of
discretion
on
the
facts,
but
there
shouldn't
be
a
conclusive
presumption
that
they
throw
us
out
of
court
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
a
motion
for
a
dismissal
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
at
all.
now,
in
california,
i
want
to
call
the
attention...
one
thing
to
the
court.
the
california
law
recognizes
that
we
don't
get
the
best
price
at
a
foreclosure
sale.
they
recognize
it
in
two
ways.
first,
if
you
use
the
private
power
of
sale
that
people
use
for
the
most
part,
you
can't
get
a
deficiency
judgment.
if,
to
get
a
deficiency
judgment,
you
resort
to
the
judicial
foreclosure,
then
to
get
a
deficiency
judgment
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
fairness.
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
on
price
and
values.
now,
mention
was
made
about
mortgagees
and
trust
deed
holders,
and
california
law,
we
use
mortgages
occasionally,
but
generally
deeds
of
trust,
and
there
we
have
a
third-party
trustee
who
does
have
fiduciary
duties
to
trustor
and
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
deed.
in
the
mortgage
states,
where
they
don't
use
trust
deeds,
i
doubt
that
that
is
present.
i
doubt
that
requirement's
there
at
all
in
some
of
them.
a
flat
out,
conclusive
presumption
will
prevent
questioning
the
reasonably
equivalent
value
in
a
case
where
there's
2
or
3
percent
bid
at
a
sale,
and
there
are
sales
that
happen
like
that,
and
certainly
we
should
leave
the
door
open
to
question
those
sales.
now,
to
review
what
the
circuits
have
done,
we
have
circuit
courts
in
five
circuits
that
have
definitely
decided
that
there's
no
conclusive
presumption.
third
circuit,
barrett
was
decided.
fifth
circuit,
durrett
and
abramson
under
the
old
law,
and
dessing
under
the
new
statute.
seventh
circuit,
bundles,
eighth
circuit,
hulm,
eleventh
circuit,
littleton
and
grissom,
cited
in
our
briefs.
the
fourth
circuit
is
covered
by
the
morris
case,
which
didn't
really
arise
as
a
foreclosure
case,
but
applies
the
rule
and
sets
forth
the
standards.
in
the
first
circuit,
we
have
a
hopeless
conflict.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
case
i
didn't
cite,
national
environmental
systems
in
111,
bankruptcy
reports
4,
a
new
hampshire
case,
which
i
think
gives
the
better
view
in
that
circuit.
in
the
second
circuit,
we
have
the
saklin
mortgage
case.
the
citation
on
that,
i
have
the
lexis
citation,
1993
bankruptcy
lexis
1187.
in
the
fourth
circuit
we
have
springfield
furniture,
145
bankruptcy
reports
520.
that--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--your
honor,
that
comes
down
the
wholesale
question.
where
a
retailer
is
selling
in
bulk
to
close
out,
he's
selling
on
a
liquidation
basis
for
what
he
can
get.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
well,
he...
at
least
it's
a
voluntary
sale
and
it's
not
taken
from
him,
and
he
makes
the
decision
that
it's
best
to
sell
it,
and
he
can
sell
it
at
a
wholesale
price.
now,
we
have
one
case
i
cited
in
the
brief,
and
i
forget
the
name
of
it,
where
someone
failed
to
get
a
markup.
he
got
a...
the
bankruptcy
court
held
there
should
be
a
20
or
30
percent
markup,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
could
be
a
little
less
than
that,
but
set
aside
the
sale
unless
the
difference
in
value
is
paid
by
the
transferee.
so
we
can
have
situations
where
we
could
set
aside
sales
that
are
liquidation
sales,
or
sales
that
are...
that
are
below
retail
value
but
above
wholesale
value.
i
think
that
congress
wanted
us
to
look
at
the
foreclosure
situation
and
especially
said
so
after
the
durrett
decision
was
rendered
and
the
congress
has
an
amendment
to
the
statute
proposed
that
will
adopt
the
madrid
conclusive
presumption
rule.
instead
of
adopting
that,
they
didn't
adopt
that
amendment,
and
they
did
put
in
section
101
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
in
the
definition
of
transfers,
specifically
the
foreclosure
of
an
equity
of
redemption
is
a
transfer.
now,
what
does
that
mean?
that's
the
foreclosure
situation.
congress
wants
this
to
apply
to
a
foreclosure
situation.
that
was
a
clear--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--well,
congress...
of
course,
the
court
would
find
it...
the
clearer
the
language
of
congress,
the
easier
the
job
for
the
court,
and
the
more
consistent
throughout
the
country--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--where
it's
unclear,
of
course
the
court
can
take
into
account
extraneous
things
other
than
the
face
of
the
statute
to
try
to
interpret
them.
the
court
has
to
make
a
determination
where
congress
has
made
a
statute
that's
not
clear.
but
i
think
they've
said,
reasonably
equivalent
value,
which
means
something
like
market
value...
it's
a
comparison,
a
relationship.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
well,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
the
words
"equivalent
value"
are
very
clear,
and
"reasonably"
makes
it
a
little
uncertain
and
puts
the
burden
on
the
court
to
make
some
decision
about
it,
but
certainly
not
as
the
type
of
sale.
it's
mainly
a
comparison
of
value.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
well,
there
may
be
a
difference.
now--
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
--oh,
yes.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
well,
i
think
that
it
applies
to
foreclosures
as
well
as
other
transactions,
yes,
and
what
would
it
do
if
it
doesn't
apply
to
foreclosure,
it
could
apply
to
other
transactions,
that's
clear,
but
here
we
have,
in
101,
the
congress
specifically
saying
the
foreclosure
of
an
equity
of
redemption
is
a
transfer,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
got
to
say
that
foreclosures
can
be
reviewed
by
the
court.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
that
is
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
i
don't
think
so.
thank
you,
your
honor.
are
there
any
other
questions?
mr.
roy
b.
woolsey
thank
you.
