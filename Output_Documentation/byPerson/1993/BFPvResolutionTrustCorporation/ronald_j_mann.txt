mr.
ronald
j.
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
bankruptcy
court
may
invalidate
a
real
property
foreclosure
sale
that
was
properly
conducted
under
state
law
and
held
before
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
began
on
the
theory
that
the
consideration
received
at
that
sale
was
not
a
reasonably
equivalent
value
for
purposes
of
section
548.
i
would
like
to
focus
here
on
two
points.
first,
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
taken
in
context,
does
not
require
the
result
petitioner
seeks,
and
second,
that
a
rule
permitting
invalidation
of
such
a
sale
is
inconsistent
with
the
principles
this
court
has
articulated
for
construing
the
bankruptcy
code.
first,
the
language.
the
key
statutory
phrase
is
the
reference
to
reasonably
equivalent
value
in
section
548,
and
in
our
view
the
key
consideration
in
interpreting
that
phrase
is
the
difference
between
that
phrase
and
the
phrases
that
congress
used
in
other
places
where
it
confronted
valuation
questions
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
most
commonly,
it
used
the
unqualified
term,
value.
in
several
places
it
referred
to
fair
market
value.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
yes,
they
are,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
the
way
to
go
about
it
is
to
try
and
ascertain
why
congress
would
have
chosen
the
particular
words
that
they
used
and
then
look
at
them
through
the
lens
that
the
court
has
used
for
evaluating
other
similar
problems
the
court
has
faced
under
the
bankruptcy
code
where
you
could
interpret
language
in
a
way
that
would
disrupt
systems
that
the
states
have
carefully
put
together
for
dealing
with
difficult
policy
questions.
when
congress
said
the
value
needed
only
to
be
reasonably
equivalent,
as
you
noted,
it
must
mean
that
it
could
be
something
less
than
market
value,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
also
must
have
meant
that
the
set
of
considerations
that
are
relevant
are
going
to
be
different
than
the
ones
that
would
have
been
relevant
if
you
were
just
trying
to
ascertain
fair
market
value.
along
those
lines,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
realize
that
the
question
of
value
is
not
an
objective,
perfect
question.
everyone
talks
about
how,
well,
he
should
just
bid
70
percent
of
the
fair
market
value.
a
person
bidding
at
a
foreclosure
sale
can't
know
exactly
what
the
value
will
be
determined
by
a
judge
several
years
later.
he's
going
to
bid
the
amount
that
he
believes
the
property
is
worth
to
him,
and
then
the
bankruptcy
judge
task
later
is
to
determine...
try
to
recreate
a
market
transaction
and
to
ascertain
what
would
have
happened
if
the
property
had
been
sold
in
a
market
transaction.
in
our
view,
when
the
property,
as
it
has
at
a
foreclosure
sale,
has
already
been
sold
at
a
market
transaction,
there's
no
reason
to
believe,
absent
congress
telling
us
that
the
court
should
do
that,
that
congress
intended
for
the
judge
to
attempt
to
do
a
better
job
of
pricing
the
property
than
the
market.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--the
rule
that
we
seek
rests
on
several
features
that
are
really
unique,
i
think,
to
real
property
foreclosure
sales.
you
start
from
the
premise
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
that
the...
i'm...
that's
right.
the
rule
we
seek
rests
sort
of
on
a
combination
of
two
factors:
1)
you
have
a
market
transaction
that's
a
public
auction.
almost
all
state
foreclosure
sales
are
going
to
bear
four
features.
there's
going
to
be
a
public
notice.
there's
going
to
be
a
notice
to
the
debtor
so
he'll
know
the
sale
will
occur.
there'll
be
a
substantial
waiting
period,
and
then
the
property
will
be
sold
at
an
auction
that
is
open
to
members
of
the
public
at
which
they
can
purchase
it
and
it
will
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder.
when
a
state
sets
a--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
it's...
i'm
less
willing
to
sort
of
agree
with
that
type
of
a
generalization,
because
redemption--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--there
is
in
california,
but
it
ends
at
the
date
of
the
foreclosure
sale.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
mean,
you
have
a
provision
for
redemption,
but
foreclosure--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--no,
because
the
redemption
ends
at
the
foreclosure
sale.
if
you
purchase
at
the
foreclosure
sale,
there
is
no
further
right
of
redemption
and
you
own
the
property
free
and
clear,
subject
to
the
chance--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--in
some
states
there
is
a...
it's
actually
an
anomaly
to
refer
to
a
right
of
redemption
that
continues
after
foreclosure,
because
foreclosure
typically
is
the
foreclosing
of
the
debtor's
rights--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--but
in
some--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--in
some
states...
in
some
states
that
does
occur.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--right,
i
mean
i--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
actually
that
there's
a
tendency
for
there
not
to
be
redemption
periods
that
continue
after
foreclosure
sales
that
are
privately
conducted
under
a
power
of
sale,
and
given...
of
course,
some
states
have
those
rules,
though,
and
in
a
state
that
does
have
such
a
rule,
i
agree
the
redemption
period
would
chill
the
bidding
some,
but
you
have
to
realize--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
actually,
this
case
is...
suggests
something
contrary
to
what
you're
suggesting,
because
the
mortgagor...
the
foreclosing
lender
actually
bid
more
than
the
amount
of
the
indebtedness,
which
it
certainly
had
no
reason
to
do.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
the
question
remains
whether
it's
a
500,000
house,
but
the
point
i
guess
i
would
make
is
that
the
redemption
period
would
chill
the
bidding
a
little
bit,
but
a
redemption
period
at
least
has
a
specific
period
of
time
that
once
it
passes,
everything
is
over.
the
rule
that
is
sought
in
this
case
would
not
work
that
way,
because
it
would
be
a
much
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
any
bankruptcy
proceeding
that's
filed
within
1
year
of
the
sale,
then,
anytime
within
the
bankruptcy
period
proceeding
until
a
trustee
is
appointed...
in
this
case,
for
example,
a
trustee
was
never
appointed,
then
2
years
beyond
that.
this
can
even
go
beyond
the
confirmation
of
a
plan
in
a
chapter
11
proceeding.
until
all
the
payments
have
been
made
someone
can
come
back
in
and
file
such
an
action,
and
then
the
worst
thing,
from
the
perspective
of
a
person
who's
trying
to
purchase,
is
that
if
the
transaction
is
invalidated,
unlike
a
redemption
period,
the
person
doesn't
get
their
money
back.
when
a
redemption
thing
happens,
the
borrower
comes
in,
he
pays
off
the
loan,
and
the
person
has
their
money
and
they
can
walk
away.
what
happens
here
is,
all
you
have
to
get
is
a
lien
on
the
property
of
indefinite
duration,
and
if
the
property
has
increased
in
value,
whether
because
the
market
has
changed
or
because
you
have
improved
it,
you
cannot
profit
from
this
investment,
so
it's
a
powerful
incentive
not
to
purchase
property
and
not
to
develop
the
property
after
you've
purchased
it.
in
a
redemption
period,
we
really
have
none
of
those
truly
severe
and
constrictive
effects,
and
i
think
that's
what
makes
this
type
of
thing
so
troubling
to
commerce
in
land.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
durrett
for
quite
some
time,
and
it
is...
it's
my
personal
experience
that
third
parties
very
rarely
bid
at
foreclosure
sales
that
are
conducted
in
the
states.
i've
practiced
in
texas.
i
haven't
conducted
foreclosure
sales
on
other
sales
in
the
fifth
circuit,
but
at
least
in
texas,
third
parties
rarely
bid,
and
one
of
the
main
problems
is
they
cannot,
under
any
circumstances,
acquire
title
insurance
because
of
the
effect
of
durrett.
absent
durrett,
you
would
be
able
to
purchase
a
title
insurance
policy,
the
title
insurance
company
would
carefully
peruse
the
foreclosure
documents,
make
sure
the
lawyers
had
filed
everything
in
the
right
place
and
said
the
magic
words,
and
then
if
you
bought
it
at
the
sale,
you
could
have
a
title
policy
and
you
would
know
you
would
own
the
property,
but
you
can't...
you
get
a
policy
that
has
an
exception,
so
you
really
can't
buy
the
property,
and
no
one
would
be
willing
to
make
a
significant
commercial
investment
because
of
the
risk
of
it
being
overturned,
and
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
i
think
that's
hard
to
tell.
there's
a
footnote
in
our
brief--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--the
information
of
the
people
that
have
conducted
empirical
studies,
there
are
articles
that
go
both
ways
on
that
particular
point.
there's
a
very
good
article
that
we
cite
in
our
brief...
i
think
it's
by
professor
schill...
that
points
out
the
fact
that
the
relation
between
mortgagee
protection
laws
and
actual
rates
of
lending
is
likely
to
be
very
small
because
such
a
small
percentage
of
laws
go
into
default.
there
would
have
to
be
a
truly
dramatic
difference
to
actually
affect
the
rate
of
lending,
but
that's
not
to
suggest
that
the
market
for
foreclosed
property
is
not
important.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
oh,
i
disagree
with
that
strongly.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
my
point
is
simply
that
if
you
accept
petitioner's
position,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
insurance
companies
are
going
to
decline
to
extend
loans
for
homes
in
texas.
i
don't
think
it
will
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
market
for
origination
of
loans.
it
probably
will
have
some
effect,
but
for
empirical
reasons
the
number
of
defaulting
loans
is
not
that
significant,
but
it
will
have
a
dramatic
effect,
i
think,
on
the
market
for
foreclosed
property,
and
in
texas
at
least
that's
a
very
significant
market.
the
resolution
trust
corporation--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--no,
but
it's
also
by
its
nature
the
type
of
thing
that
you
can't
really
have
empirical
data
because
the
only
way
to
get
empirical
data,
you'd
have
to
sort
out
the
effect
of
this
particular
rule
from
the
effects
of
all
sorts
of
other
things
going
on
in
the
real
estate
market,
and
as
you
know
from...
i
think
the
court
knows
the
real
estate
market
in
major
cities
in
texas
has
been
going
up
and
down
a
lot
during
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--no,
what
my
point...
my
principle
point
isn't
that
you
should
rely
on
your
intuitive
judgment,
it's
that
the
states
have
made
a
judgment,
the
states
have
addressed
this
problem--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
the
states
have
all
addressed
the
problem
one
way
or
another,
and
i
guess
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
in
fact
a
fiduciary
duty
state...
the
case
before
the
court.
as
we
cite
in
the
brief
a
case,
there
is
a
fiduciary
duty
imposed
on
the
foreclosing
trustee
under
california
law.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
guess
i
would
have
made
a
slightly
different
point,
which
is
that
i
don't
think
you
can
tell,
necessarily,
that
imposition
of
a
fiduciary
duty
in
this
context
is
a
good
thing
in
the
sense
that
it
will
increase
values.
when
you
impose
a
fiduciary
duty,
people
are
subject
to
suit,
people
may
not
wish
to
undertake
the
duty,
and
therefore
you
may
have
less
competent
people
performing
the
sale.
i
think
this
is
the
type
of
decision,
it's
not
all
that
clear
which
set
of
rules
is
likely
to
produce
the
most
effective
overall
benefit
for
all
of
the
parties
involved,
and
the
states
have
got
different
rules.
the
rules
in
california
are
one
thing,
the
rules
in
texas
are
different,
but
i
don't
think
it's
particularly
easy
to
say
that
one
set
of
rules
is
necessarily
more
protective
than
the
other.
but
i
do
agree
with
your
point
that
the
value
of
property
must
take...
that
is
sold
by
foreclosure,
a
reasonably
equivalent
value,
must
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
property
in
question
was
subject
to
a
lien
where
the
parties
agreed
that
this
was
the
way
that
the
value
would
be
determined
and
that
the
property
would
be
transferred.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
i
think
if
you
take
a
step
back
and
look
at
section
548
as
a
whole
it
becomes
clear
what's
going
on.
section
548
is
designed
to
recover
fraudulent
conveyances,
and
the
reason
that
we're
worried
about
fraudulent
conveyances
is
that
when
borrowers
become
insolvent,
they
don't
have
any
incentive
to
seek
a
reasonably
equivalent
value
for
their
property
because
it's
all
going
to
go
to
their
creditors
anyway,
and
so
congress
passed
a
statute,
like
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
states,
that
would
allow
a
representative
of
the
creditors
to
recover
the
property
if
it
was
transferred
for
less
than
a
reasonably
equivalent
value.
now,
in
order
to
do
that,
someone
is
going
to
have
to
look
and
determine
what
the
actual
value
of
the
property
is,
because
you
can't
tell
if
you
didn't
get
enough
until
you
determine
what
the
value
is,
and
if
the
property
has
been
transferred
in
a
voluntary
sale
such
as
the
one
to
which
justice
o'connor
referred,
the
only
way
that
the
judge
can
evaluate
the
sale
is
by
attempting
to
recreate
a
market
transaction.
but
if
the
transaction
that
has
already
occurred
was
one
in
which
anyone
who
wished
to
purchase
the
property
was
free
to
show
up
and
purchase
it
and
the
highest
bidder
purchased
the
property,
it
would
seem
unlikely
that
a
judge
would
be
systemically
placed
to
make
a
better
determination
of
value
after
the
fact
than
the
market
made
at
the
time,
and
i
think
if
you
take
that
point
and
add
to
it
the
point
that
this
is
area
in
which
the
states
have
traditionally
been
responsible
for,
the
court
has
been
reluctant
to
interfere
with
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
there's
three
points
i'd
like
to
make
in
response
to
that,
if
i
have
time.
the
first
point
is
not
necessarily
in
response
to
your
question,
but
i
want
to
mention
the
seventh
circuit
rule.
it
may
seem
initially
attractive
to
have
some
sort
of
rebuttable
presumption
to
allow
things
to
be
considered,
but
from
our
view
the
real
problem
with
such
rule
is
that
it
doesn't
really
do
much
better
than
a
70
percent
rule,
because
it
leads
people
who
would
wish
to
purchase
at
a
foreclosure
sale
in
the
predicament
of
not
knowing
for
sure
that
they
actually
are
purchasing
anything.
with
respect
to
your
question,
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
section
548,
as
i
was
trying
to
explain
to
justice
souter,
it
really
hinges
on
the
notion
that
the
debtor
doesn't
have
any
incentive
to
secure
an
appropriate
value
for
the
property.
when
it's
sold
by
a
foreclosure
sale,
the
debtor
is
not
in
a
position
to
be
attempting
to
dissipate
the
assets
of
the
state.
he
has
no
choice
in
the
matter.
the
creditor
is
doing
it.
and
moreover,
at
least
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
under
state
law
it's
generally
true,
although
it's
not
that
clear,
the
sale
is
conducted
by
a
third
party
who
is
charged
under
state
law
with
a
fiduciary
duty
to
obtain
the
highest
possible
price
for
the
property,
and
i
think
in
those
circumstance
it's
quite
difficult
to
see
that
there
really
is
a
separate
bankruptcy
policy
to
which
the
state
has
not
attended.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
think
in
most
states
it
is
true
that
the
foreclosure
sale...
that
if
there's
not
a
fiduciary
duty
there
are
other
ways
to
which...
that
a
trustee
is
in
substance
held
to
the
fact
that
if
he
does
not
comply
with
those
procedures
he
will
be
effectively
harmed
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
for
one
thing,
obviously
the
statute
in
california
does
impose
considerably
more
obligations
than
that,
but
i
don't
think
it's
clear
that
congress
intended
to
have
judges
attempt
to
recreate
the
market
and
get
a
better
value
than
the
market
did,
and
i
guess
that's
the
point
i
would
make
on
that.
one
last
point
i
wanted
to
make
about--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--oh,
i...
that's
a
good
point.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
the
situation
here
is
not
one
that
would
be
covered
by
section
548(a)(1)
because
there
would
not
be
any
fraud
by
the
debtor.
any
fraud
that
would
have
occurred
in
a
sale
like
this
would
be
if
the
lender
was
doing
something
wrong,
and
it
would
not
be
addressed
by
any
provision
other
than
548(a)(2).
if
this
provision
were
not
here,
and
if
the
voluntary
and
involuntary
language
that
was
added
by
the
amendments
were
not
there,
then
a
completely
collusive
foreclosure
sale,
as
long
as
the
debtor
didn't
have
any...
wasn't
a
part
of
the
collusion,
which
is
entirely
possible...
for
example,
a
sale
at
which
a
foreclosing
lender
sold
it
to
a
related
company
for
a
peppercorn...
would
be
immune
from
invalidation
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
and
that
would
be
something
that
congress
would
be
concerned
about.
