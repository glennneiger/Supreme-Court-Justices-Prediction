we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
92,1370,
bfp
v.
resolution
trust
corporation.
mr.
woolsey,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
woolsey,
do
you
agree
that
interpreting
the
phrase,
reasonably
equivalent
value,
the
circumstances
of
the
sale
can
be
taken
into
consideration,
a
foreclosure
sale
on
the
one
had
as
opposed
to
an
arm's
length
transaction
where
the
property
is
finally
found
a
buyer
after
2
or
3
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
ask
you
what
most
of
the
cases
said.
i
asked
you
what
your
position
is
in
the
matter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
it
effective?
you
have
to
put
the
thing
together
rather
quickly.
it
doesn't...
isn't
it
common
knowledge
that
if
you
can
hold
a
property
on
the
market
for
several
years
and
wait
for
a
buyer,
you're
going
to
get
a
much
better
price
than
if
you
have
to
sell
it
quite
rapidly
at
what
is
in
effect
a
forced
sale?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
shouldn't
you
be
able
to
take
that
into
consideration
in
determining
reasonably
equivalent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
woolsey--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
we
accept
your
condition...
position,
wouldn't
one
of
the
practical
effects
be
to
mean
that
you
could
get...
a
seller
could
get
still
less
at
a
foreclosure
sale
because
it
would
be
relatively
more
easy
to
upset
the
result
of
a
foreclosure
sale--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
woolsey.
mr.
mann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mann.
mr.
sment,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sment.
mr.
woolsey,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
woolsey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
