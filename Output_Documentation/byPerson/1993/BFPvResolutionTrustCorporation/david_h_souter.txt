justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
your
answer,
i
take
it,
would
be
different
if
the
state
system
imposed
a
fiduciary
duty
on
the
foreclosing
mortgagee,
because
in
that
case
the
mortgagee
would
be
bound
to
take
whatever
steps
would
be
necessary
to
realize
the
highest
possible
value,
and
i
think
your
argument
is
that
the
state
systems
characteristically
don't
impose
any
such
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
had
a...
we'll
call
it
a
fiduciary
state,
and
the
fiduciary
standard
was
in
fact
satisfied,
then
it
would
be
odd
to
construe
the
federal
statute
to
require
any
different
obligation.
wouldn't
that
be
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
is
reasonably
equivalent
value--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
take
it
that
you're
ready
to
admit
that
what
is
reasonably
equivalent
takes
into
consideration
the
circumstances
of
the
sale,
not
only
the
fact
that
it's
a
foreclosure
sale,
but
the
fact
that
the
foreclosing
party
may
or
may
not
make
efforts
to
get
in
real
buyers,
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
real
market
for
this
property,
and
so
on.
all
i
was
suggesting
was
that
given
the
scope
of
what
the
term
reasonable
implies
here,
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
state
that
did
impose
a
fiduciary
duty,
an
obligation
to
get
top
dollar
and
to
take
whatever
steps
were
necessary
to
take
top
dollar,
isn't
it
likely
to
be
the
case
that
satisfying
that
standard
would
also
satisfy
the
standard
in
the
federal
act
of
obtaining
what
is
reasonably
equivalent?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you're
going
to...
if
you're
going
to
construe
the
statute
as
implying
simply
a
comparison
of
values,
why
do
you
accept
70
percent?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
i
lend
justice
scalia
1
and
he
says
i'll
give
you
70
cents
back,
i'm
going
to
squawk.
i'm
going
to
say,
that's
not
reasonably
equivalent.
why
are
you
willing
to
take
70
percent
if
you're
not
willing
to
lose
your
30
percent
in
view
of
the
circumstances
that
as
a
practical
matter
would
prevent
you
from
ever
realizing
the
30
percent.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
willing
to
take
70?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
mann,
i
have
difficulty
squaring
your
argument,
i
admit,
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
we
have
an
easier
way
to
assess
it,
and
that
is,
the
parade
of
horribles
that
you
suggest
should
have
happened
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
yet
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
durrett
for,
what
is
it,
12
or
13
years
now,
and
i
haven't
heard
anything
in
any
of
the
briefs
about
the
destruction
of
the
market
for
mortgages
in
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
you're
saying
that
in
effect
durrett
has
not
had
the
effect
of
markedly
increasing
the
amounts
that
are
paid
on
foreclosure,
but
i
take
it
by
the
same
token
that
you
don't
touch
this
other
subject
that
durrett
has
not
had
an
effect
on
the
market,
on
the
mortgage
lending
market.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
just
don't
have
anything
in
the
record,
do
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that
is
the
case,
your
strongest
argument,
or
your
strongest
empirical
argument
seems
to
be
that
if
you
accept
the
petitioner's
position
you're
still
not
going
to
do
very
much
as
a
practical
matter
to
benefit
either
mortgagors
or
unsecured
creditors.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
misunderstand
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
have
empirical
data
from
the
fifth
circuit
to
the
effect
that
this
has
happened
in
the
last
12
years,
that
in
fact
the
bid
price
has
gone
down
rather
than
gone
up
as
a
result
of
the
durrett
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
it
boils
down
to
is,
you
in
effect
are
saying
to
us
that
we've
got
to
rely
on
our
intuitive
judgment
that
despite
13
years
in
the
fifth
circuit
there,
there
isn't
any
hard
data
to
go
on
on
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
i
don't
see
that
at
all.
the
states
have
made
judgments
about,
in
effect,
due
process
requirements.
some
states
have
made
judgments
about
fiduciary
responsibilities,
but
not
all
states
have,
and
i
gather
that
that
in
fact
is
not
even
the
majority
rule,
so
that
a
state
that
requires
nothing
more
than
the
printing
of
a
notice
in
fine
print
in
the
legal
notice
section
of
a
newspaper
for
3
successive
weeks
is
certainly
not
a
state
which
is
showing
any
concern
to
maximize
the
amounts
of
money
realized
on
foreclosure
sales.
and
under
your
rule,
whether
we
had
a
fiduciary
state
or
a
3-week
notice
state,
the
result
would
be
exactly
the
same.
whatever
was
realized
would
be
reasonable
equivalent,
and
yet
the
states
are
not
all
addressing
the
problem
that
we're
addressing.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
that
assumes
the...
i
guess
that
assumes
the
answer.
you
say
the
parties
have
agreed.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
all
that
congress
wanted
to
get
at
was
a
requirement
that
the
value
that
is
received
be
received
after
compliance
with
state
law,
they
took
a
very
obtuse
way
to
require
that,
because
it
would
have
been
far
simpler
to
provide
precisely
that,
and
we
wouldn't
have
this
question
before
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
were
correct
that
every
state
was
a
fiduciary
state,
you'd
have
a
stronger
argument,
but
every
state
isn't,
and
i
suspect
most
are
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
may
or
may
not
be...
there
may
or
may
not
be,
but
i
would
have
supposed
the
language
of
this
statute
made
it
clear
that
congress
wanted
some
way
to
subject
this
person
to
a
higher
duty
than
merely
publishing
a
notice
three
times,
3
weeks
in
succession.
justice
david
h.
souter
no
one
would
spend
1
if
he
could
get
it
for
nothing.
no
one
would...
no
one
would
buy
if
he
could
steal.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
where
that
gets
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
trouble,
it
seems
to
me,
with
your
argument
is
that
if
the
phrase
in
question,
reasonably
equivalent
value,
means
nothing
more
than
you
say
it
does
and
imposes
no
more
of
a
duty
than
you
say
it
imposes,
it
would
have
been
infinitely
simpler
for
congress
simply
to
say
that
a
bona
fide
sale
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
state
statutory
or
common
law
will
be
conclusively
presumed
to
realize
a
fair
or
sufficient
value,
and
it
would
avoid
all
of
the
interpretive
problems
that
we've
got.
it
didn't
take
that
simple
course,
and
because
it
didn't,
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
face
of
it
it
must
have
meant
something
more.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
it
does,
and
it
certainly
precludes
the...
it
seems
to
me,
the
application
of
a...
in
effect
a
per
se
rule
that
once
there
is
a
noncollusive,
nonfraudulent
sale
in
accordance
with
state
statutory
requirements,
that's
the
end
of
the
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
the
better
rule,
even
under
your
own
argument,
simply
that
there
is
no
conclusive
presumption,
but
that
in
california...
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
true
or
not.
i'll
just
accept
this.
but
in
california,
you
have
done
all,
in
fact...
by
complying
with
state
law
you
have
done
all
that
would
be
commercially
reasonable,
and
that
when
this
case
in
fact
goes
to
trial,
you
ought
to
win
it,
and
we'll
assume
you
will
win
it.
but
in
a
state
which
requires
nothing
but,
in
effect,
legal
publication
for
a
certain
number
of
weeks,
you
wouldn't
win
it,
and
that's
why
we
should
not
have
an
across-the-board
conclusive
presumption.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we've
got
to
interpret
the
statute
for
the
whole
country,
not
just
for
california.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
not
asking
it
to
be
interpreted
based
on
the
facts
that
are
before
us.
you're
asking
for
the
conclusive
presumption,
and
yet
your
own
argument
about
the
ingredients
of
reasonableness
suggest
that
you
in
fact
are
not
really
justifying
a
conclusive
presumption,
and
in
this
case
you
take
the
position,
and
it
may
be
a
quite
sound
position,
that
you
would
win
even
without
the
conclusive
presumption.
justice
david
h.
souter
not
if
we're
going
to
have...
not
if
we're
going
to
have
one
rule
for
50
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
the
statute
doesn't
mean
something
different
in
california
from
what
it
means
in
vermont.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you...
you
make
very
easy
to
answer
when
you
say
you've
obtained
the
value
that
you
can,
and
some
state
laws
require
you
to
obtain...
or
to
do
everything
reasonably
possible
to
obtain
that
value.
other
state
laws
don't,
and
because
they
don't,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
an
argument,
and
i
thought
you
were
accepting
it,
for
a...
not
for
a
conclusive
presumption,
but
for
a
reasonableness
analysis
of
the
facts
of
the
individual
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
under
state
law
a
bid
simply
for
the
amount
of
the
debt
is
always
going
to
be
conclusively
deemed
to
be
sufficient,
the
equity
of
redemption
is
always
going
to
be
worth
zero,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
presumably
congress
didn't
mean
that.
