mr.
michael
r.
sment
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
we're
here
today
to
hopefully
promote
the
established
doctrine
of
federalism
and
the
continuing
validity
of
state
foreclosure
law.
i
think
we're
also
here
today
to
provide
some
protection
for
innocent
third
party
purchasers
who
purchase
at
real
estate
sales
conducted
pursuant
to
foreclosure
laws,
exactly
like
my
clients.
mr.
michael
r.
sment
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
in
order
to
do
that
we
need
to
focus
on
the
key
term,
reasonably,
and
i
think
on
focusing
on
that
term,
as
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
admits,
we
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
in
the
sale.
i
think
in
order
to
look
at
that
statute
and
that
term,
we
have
to
look
at
the
intent
of
congress
to
determine--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--the
per
se
rule
does
look
at
most
of
the
circumstances
of
the
sale,
and
i
think
that's
something
that
the
petitioner
seems
to
overlook,
that
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusive
presumption
that
the
ninth
circuit
allows,
we
do
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
in
a
number
of
factors
at
the
sale,
with
one
exception.
mr.
michael
r.
sment
no,
we
look
to
see
if
it
was
noncollusive,
which
doesn't
necessarily
mean
state
law--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--and
the
third
one--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--well,
but
in
looking
in
that,
your
honor,
the
third
one
is,
was
it
a
fraudulent
sale?
mr.
michael
r.
sment
in
order
to
look
at
that,
your
honors,
we
have
to
look
at
the
parties
involved,
we
have
to
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--that
isn't
what
happened
here,
your
honor,
and
keep--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--well,
keep
in
mind
here,
your
honor,
under
california
law
and
under
most
foreclosure
laws,
1
bid
over
the
credit
price
for
the
loan
is
sufficient
to
buy
the
property,
and
there's
no
investor
that
would
necessarily
spend
more
than
the
1
if
he
didn't
have
to,
so
the
implication
from
the
11,000--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--well,
i
don't
think
the
foreclosure
laws
deal
with
stealing,
justice
souter,
and
i
would
be--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--but
your
honor,
doesn't
the
term,
reasonably,
suggest
that
the
court
has
to
conduct
its
evaluation
under
the
circumstances
it
faces?
mr.
michael
r.
sment
i
disagree
in
part,
justice
souter,
and
only
because
i
think
in
the
analysis
for
determining
the
reasonable
equivalent
value,
the
court
has
to
consider
the
state
law.
i
mean,
it
has
to
consider
the
effect
of
that
and
whether
congress
could
have--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--and
it's
the
very
fact
of
that
variety
that
precludes
an
application
of
the
bundles
decision.
for
example,
bundles
talks
about
appraisals
of
the
property.
that
is
not
required
in
most
states.
it's
not
required
in
california
for
foreclosure.
bundles
talks
about
additional
advertising
or
broker
involvement.
that
is
not
only
not
required
under
california
law,
it's
assumably
not
permitted
by
the
california
statutes.
i
think
that
again,
in
considering
the
term
"reasonably",
could
congress
have
said
something
different?
yes.
there's
implications
that
it
may
have
tried
to
do
that.
we
don't
have
anything
different.
but
to
the
contrary,
it
hasn't
prohibited
a
conclusive
presumption.
it
hasn't
prohibited
the
circuits
or
the
bankruptcy
courts
from
interpreting
and
looking
at
state
law.
mr.
michael
r.
sment
i
disagree
in
part,
your
honor.
i
think
that
a
collusive
sale
could
possibly
be
attacked
under
section
548,
but
when
you
have
an
elaborate,
statutory
scheme
like
you
have
in
california,
and
a
sale
is
conducted
pursuant
to
that
scheme,
if
you
then
step
in
and
allow
a
bankruptcy
to
create
a
collateral
attack
on
that
sale
that
would
not
be
available
in
state
court,
then
you're
undoing
the
state
foreclosure
laws.
mr.
michael
r.
sment
section
548
is
not
limited
to
foreclosure
sales,
so
if
we
had
a
nonjudicial...
or
a
nonforeclosure
sale
sale,
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
all
of
those
circumstances
under
section
548.
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit's
point
of
view,
and
the
reason
for
their
opinion,
is
we
need
a
rule
of
certainty
here,
and
at
least
in
the
context
of
a
foreclosure
sale
that
has
intricate
statutory
provisions,
that
provides
sufficient
notice
not
only
to
the
borrower
but
to
the
public,
and
under
a
scheme
that
we've
indicated
is
intended
to
protect
not
just
the
borrower
but
he
lender,
third-party
purchasers
like
my
clients,
and
the
public
at
large,
those
are
the
interests
that
are
balanced
by
the
foreclosure
statute.
and
congress
hasn't
said
that
in
interpreting
or
looking
at
a
case
under
the
term
"reasonably"
you
can't
consider
all
those
factors,
nor
that
you
can't
have
a
conclusive
presumption.
this
court
made
it
quite
clear
in
the
arizona
v.
maricopa
county
case
that
a
per
se
rule
could
be
valid
to
provide
certainty,
to
reduce
complex
litigation,
to
provide
some
business
reasons
here
for
why
opportunities
ought
to
go
forward.
that's
why
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
the
way
it
did.
we
have
a
complex
sale.
if
we
had
a
sale
that
wasn't
a
foreclosure
sale
and
didn't
have
to
comply
with
all
of
this
checklist
of
noticing,
published
notices,
recorded
notices,
actual
bidding,
auctioning,
all
these
different
requirements,
then
there
might
not
be
a
basis
to
establish
a
conclusive
presumption
because
you
haven't
jumped
through
all
the
hurdles
to
get
to
that
sale,
and
keep
in
mind--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--your
honor,
i
think
in
a
state
where
there
is
a
law,
you
do
need
that
presumption.
i
think
you
need
that--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--i
understand,
your
honor,
but
we
also
have
to
interpret
it
based
on
the
facts
that
are
before
us,
and
the
stats--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--if
that's
the
case,
your
honor,
where
you
would
win
without
the
presumption,
isn't
that
a
basis
for
applying
the
presumption?
isn't
that
what
this
court
said
in
the
maricopa
county--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
if
we
have
one
rule--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--but
if
it
means
that
under
your
law
you've
satisfied
all
the
tests
in
our
state
to
determine
whether
you've
done
what
the
statutes
require,
you've
obtained
the
value
that
you
can,
you've
protected
all
of
these
parties,
isn't
that
a
basis--
mr.
michael
r.
sment
--i
was
trying
to
respond
to
your
question,
justice.
thank
you.
