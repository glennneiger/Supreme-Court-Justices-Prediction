bader

--may
i
deflect
you
for
a
moment
just
to
clarify
for
me,
what
is
the
end
result
that
you're
seeking?
now,
you're
not
seeking
any
more
to
avoid
this
transfer,
but
you
are
seeking
what
and
from
whom?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
are
seeking
this
from
osborne,
or
who
are
you
seeking
it
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
were
just
to
put--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
a
nutshell
what
relief
you
think
you
qualify
for,
and
i
understand
what
you
said
about
osborne
and
the
other
buyers.
anything
against
the
federal
respondent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
sure
about
what
relief
you're
seeking,
other
than
the
difference
between
what
the
buyer
put
in
and
what
it
got
on
resale?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
thank
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you
are
disagreeing
even
with
the
seventh
circuit,
with
judge
ripple,
who
rejected
the
ninth
circuit's
view
but
did
seem
to
think
the
circumstances
of
the
sale,
including
the
foreclosure
sale,
was
a
relevant
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
response
to
justice
scalia
before,
you
were
making
the
point
that
unless
458(a)(2)
would
be
meaningless.
is
that
because
other
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act...
not
simply
state
law,
but
the
bankruptcy
act,
will
take
care
of
the
collusive
sale
and
the
sale
that
does
not
meet
the
formalities
and
the
procedures
required
under
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
irregularities
under
state
law,
there
was
another
section
under
the
bankruptcy
code
itself,
i
think,
that
would
address
that,
so
your
point
is
that
this
has
to
have
a
different
office
than
to
deal
with
those
situations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
point
about
548(a)(2)
is
that
it
would
be
meaningless
unless
it
had
to
do
with
something
other
than
the
formalities
of
state
law
and
whether
it
was
collusive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mann,
but
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
bundles
case,
in
dealing
with
that
issue,
said
that
the
state
has
one
concern,
and
that's
the
security
of
these
mortgage
foreclosures,
the
procedure
has
occurred,
it's
done
and
finished,
where
the
bankruptcy
law
is
designed
to
preserve
the
assets
of
the
state
and
to
see
that
what...
the
debtor
receives
something
fairly
equivalent
to
what
he
surrendered.
so
the
notion
of
the
seventh
circuit
at
least
was
that
the
bankruptcy
code
provisions
must
be
interpreted
in
light
of
what
is
a
driving
force
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
is
different
from
the
driving
force
of
the
state
law
provisions
dealing
with
foreclosure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
taking
into
account
544,
548(1),
what
is
the
independent
office
of
548(a)(2)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
one
bankruptcy
code
and
there's
a
variety
of
state
laws,
and
some
are
more
protective,
some
have...
require
more
in
the
way
of
advertising...
do
some
require
an
appraisal
before
there's
a
sale,
and
some
don't.
so
there'd
be
such
a
lack
of
uniformity,
if
your
position
is
correct,
whereas
if
you
take
the
position
of
the
seventh
circuit,
the
foreclosure
sale
price
means
quite
a
lot,
but
it's
not
the
be-all
and
end-all
because
of
the
tremendous
varieties
in
what
the
state
law
requires.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
because
satisfying
the
requirements
of
state
law
and
noncollusive,
those
are
independently
taken
care
of
by
the
act
without
regard
to
548(a)(2),
what
does
548(a)(2)
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
understand
that
argument.
i'm
asking
you
what
548(a)(2)
then
does.
that's
a
good
argument
for
saying
it
does
nothing.
it
doesn't
need
to
do
anything,
and
it
shouldn't
do
anything.
but
you
don't
need
that
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
law
if
all
that's
required
is
you
meet
the
requirements
of
state
law
and
you're
not
collusive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could
mean
something
different
in
the
bankruptcy
context
than
it
means...
and
i
think
mr.
mann
was
talking
about
the
application
of
548(a)(2)
outside
the
bankruptcy
context.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
outside
the
foreclosure.
i'm
sorry...
outside
the
foreclosure
sale.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
in
answer
my
question,
what
good
does
this
section
do,
he
said
that
there
are
sales
other
than
foreclosure
sales,
i
believe.
