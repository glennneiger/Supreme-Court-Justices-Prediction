justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
depends
on
how
you
define
the
property,
doesn't
it?
what
is
your
proposal?
would
you
accept
a
rule
that
says
if
it's
70
percent
of
what
it
would
have
received
in
an
ordinary
real
estate
transaction,
that
that's
close
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now
that
means
that
you're
willing
to
accept
some
individuation
of
the
property
in
order
to
determine
what
its
reasonably
equivalent
value
is.
that
is,
you're
willing
to
say,
this
is
property
that
is
being
sold
at
a
foreclosure
sale,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
property
that's
being
sold
at
a
foreclosure
sale
is
only
worth
70
percent
of
what
other
property
is,
is
that
not
right,
why
you're
willing
to
say
70
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
willing
to
individuate
it
to
that
extent,
why
not
go
all
the
way
and
say,
this
is
not
only
property
of
a
sort
that's
being
sold
at
a
foreclosure
sale,
but
it
is
property
that's
being
sold
on
a
rainy
tuesday
when
some
of
the
best
buyers
in
town
are
on
summer
vacation?
once
you
agree
to
individuate,
why
don't
you
individuate
all
the
way,
and
so
whatever--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
i
say,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
gift.
i
am
the
creditor,
foreclosing
on
a
piece
of
property.
i've
already
foreclosed.
the
property
is
going
to
be
sold
tomorrow
morning
at
10:00,
and
i'm
making
you
a
gift
of
that.
how
much
is
that
gift
worth
that
i
have
to
pay
gift
tax
on?
how
much
is
it
worth?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
no.
i'm
making
you
a
gift
of
property
that
is
going
to
be...
of
the
income
from
property
that
is
going
to
be
sold
at
a
foreclosure
sale
tomorrow
at
10:00.
how
would
you
evaluate
the
value
of
that
gift?
wouldn't
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
back,
after
the
sale
occurs,
and
if
the
sale
under
these
state
conditions
which
are
prescribed
by
law
derives
10,000,
you'd
say
the
gift
was
worth
10,000,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
property
that
is
subject
to
foreclosure
under
certain
state
rules--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
whatever
it
fetches
under
those
rules
has
to
be
the
fair
value
of
that
particularly
individuated
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
if
you
didn't
follow
the
state
rules,
if
it
were
a
collusive
sale,
then
548
would
continue
to
apply,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
your
response,
mr.
mann,
that
a
state
that
has
such
a
law
that
does
not
impose
fiduciary
duty
is
a
state
that
has
by
its
laws
reduced
the
value
of
property
that
is
brought
into
foreclosure,
and
just
as
state
zoning
laws
can
reduce
the
value
of
property
and
cause
the
property
to
fetch
less
on
the
market,
so
also
states
that
have
such
foreclosure
laws
have
reduced
the
value
of
that
property,
and
so
you
are
getting
equivalent
value.
one
of
the
factors
affecting
the
value
of
property
is
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
provision...
what
would
the
provision
be
addressed
to?
what
is
your
response
to
the
question
that
justice
ginsburg
asked?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
really
doing
that,
because
you
come
before
us
and
say,
well,
two-thirds
is
close
enough.
you
think
that's
reasonable?
i'll
buy
everything
you
have
for
two-thirds
of
what
it's
worth.
is
that
reasonably--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you're
saying
70...
well,
you're
saying
70
percent
is
close--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure,
either,
and
the
logic
of
what
you're
arguing
is
that
it
should
be
100
percent,
and
that
makes
it
a
lot
more
difficult.
justice
antonin
scalia
reasonably
close
to
100
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
woolsey,
suppose
you
have
someone
who's
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
and,
realizing
that,
has
a
going-out-of-business
sale,
sells
all
the
stuff
in
the
store
not
at
70
percent
but
at
20
percent
of
what
it's
really
worth.
is
he
getting
fair
value,
or
reasonably
equivalent
value?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
a
distressed
basis,
and
he
only
gets...
you
know,
he
says
20
percent
is
the
only
thing
that
will
clear
it,
so
he
asks
20
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
congress
had
some
obligation
to
be
clearer
about
that
point
if
it
expects
us
to
set
aside
the
foreclosure
laws
of
50
states,
which
until
now
have
been
assumed
to
transfer
good
title,
and
in
the
future
they
won't?
don't
you
think
congress
had
some
obligation
to
be
clear
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just
asking,
where
do
you
think
the
burden
of
clarity
in
this
case
ought
to
be?
it's
unclear.
i
think
both
sides
acknowledge
that
to
some
extent,
but
where's
the
burden
of
clarity?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
mean
anything
at
all.
doesn't
mean
anything
for
sure
at
all,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
the
opinion
to
announce
for
the
court
in
no.
92-1370,
bfp
versus
resolution
trust
corporation.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioner,
bfp,
a
california
partnership,
took
title
to
a
house
in
newport
beach
subject
to
a
purchase
money
mortgage
held
by
imperial
savings
association,
a
savings
and
loan.
payments
due
on
the
mortgage
loan
were
not
made
and
imperial
commenced
foreclosure
proceedings.
respondent,
paul
osboren,
purchased
the
home
in
those
proceedings
for
$433,000
at
a
properly
noticed
foreclosure
sale.
bfp,
the
previous
owner
of
the
property,
soon
petitioned
for
bankruptcy
and,
acting
as
a
debtor
in
possession,
filed
a
complaint
to
set
aside
the
sale
to
osborne
as
a
fraudulent
transfer.
bfp
alleged
that
the
home
was
worth
over
$725,000
when
sold
and
thus,
was
not
exchanged
for
a
"reasonably
equivalent
value"
as
required
by
a
provision
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
code
appearing
in
title
11
u.s.c.
section
548(a)(2).
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
imperial,
by
then
insolvent
itself,
went
into
receivership
and
its
receiver,
the
resolution
trust
corporation,
was
substituted
as
a
party.
so,
we
have
here
essentially
one
bankrupt
suing
another.
the
bankruptcy
court
granted
summary
judgment
against
bfp
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
district
court
affirmed
the
dismissal
and
the
ninth
circuit's
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
affirmed
the
judgment
holding
that
absent
collusion
among
parties,
the
consideration
received
in
a
regularly
conducted
non-judicial
foreclosure
sale
establishes
reasonably
equivalent
value
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
as,
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
do
we.
we
hold
that
a
reasonably
equivalent
value
for
foreclosed
real
property
is
the
price
in
fact
received
at
the
foreclosure
sale,
so
long
as
the
sale
is
non-collusive
in
all
the
requirements
of
the
state's
foreclosure
law
have
been
complied
with.
contrary
to
the
positions
taken
by
some
courts
of
appeals,
fair
market
value
is
not
necessarily
the
benchmark
against
which
the
determination
of
reasonably
equivalent
value
is
to
be
measured.
it
maybe
presumed
that
congress
acted
intentionally
when
it
used
the
term
fair
market
value
else
where
in
the
bankruptcy
code
but
not
in
section
548,
particularly
when
the
omission
entails
replacing
standard
legal
terminology
fair
market
value
with
a
neologism
like
reasonable
equivalent
value.
moreover,
fair
market
value
presumes
market
conditions
such
as
a
willing
buyer
and
time
to
advertise
that,
by
definition,
do
not
exist
in
the
forced
sale
context.
property
that
must
be
sold
within
the
time
and
manner
strictures
of
state-prescribed
foreclosure
is
simply
worth
less
than
property
that
can
be
sold
on
the
open
market
without
such
restrictions.
reasonably
equivalent
value
also
cannot
be
read
to
mean
a
reasonable
or
fair
forced
sale
price
such
as
a
percentage
of
fair
market
value.
to
specify
a
federal
minimum
sale
price,
beyond
what
state
foreclosure
law
requires,
would
extend
bankruptcy
law
well
beyond
the
traditional
field
of
fraudulent
transfers
and
upset
the
coexistence
that
fraudulent
transfer
law
and
foreclosure
law
have
enjoyed
for
over
400
years.
it
is
true
that
under
the
law
of
fraudulent
transfers,
a
grossly
inadequate
price
raises
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
actual
fraudulent
intent,
but
it
is
black
letter
foreclosure
law
that
when
a
state's
procedures
are
followed,
the
mere
inadequacy
of
a
foreclosure
sale
price
is
no
basis
for
setting
aside
the
sale.
absent
clear
or
textual
guidance
than
the
phrase
"reasonably
equivalent
value",
a
phrase
entirely
compatible
with
preexisting
practice,
we
will
not
presume
that
congress
intended
to
displace
traditional
state
regulation
with
an
interpretation
that
would
profoundly
affect
the
state's
essential
sovereign
interest
in
the
security
and
stability
of
title
to
land.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justices
blackmun,
stevens,
and
ginsburg.
