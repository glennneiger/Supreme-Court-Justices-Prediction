justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
there's
another
important
feature,
too,
and
in
most
states
there's
a
redemption
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
in
california.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
that
has
some
chilling
effect
on
the
price
that
you
get
at
a
foreclosure
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
the
right
of
redemption,
if
it
isn't
the
right
to
redeem
within
3
months
or
6
months
after
the
sale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--transaction
at
which
the
price
is
determined
is
subject
to
a
postponement
for
closing
the
deal
until
the
redemption
period
has
expired.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
practice
in
all
states,
i
have
to
admit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
the
law's
changed
a
lot.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
an
explanation
of
why
so
often
in
these
sales
the
mortgagee
bids
in
the
price
of
the
indebtedness
and
that's
about
what
the
price
normally
is,
or
at
least,
very
frequently
is?
it
was
in
this
case,
for
example,
just
a
few
thousand
dollars
over
the
indebtedness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
11,000
more
on
a
500,000
house,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
much
longer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
circumstance
you
look
at
is
whether
it
was
conducted
in
accordance
with
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
two
circumstances:
1)
was
it
noncollusive,
2)
did
they
comply
with
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
the
same
as
noncollusive,
really.
well,
assume
it's
an
honorable
sale
and
compliance
with
state
law.
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
you
don't
care
how
many
dollars
they
got--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
lender
puts
the
property
in
for
the
mortgage
indebtedness,
is
what
normally
happens.
that's
the
normal
circum...
a
frequent
circumstance--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
11,000
plus
dollars.
