o'connor
well,
assuming
that
is
so,
for
the
original
dwi
conviction
there
was
no
jail
sentence
imposed,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
that
sentence,
under
our
holding
in
the
scott
case,
is
not
unconstitutional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
conviction
and
sentence
for
the
dwi
are
not
unconstitutional,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and
you
accept
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i
suppose
that
at
most
sentencings
it
is
possible
for
the
sentencing
authority
to
consider
even
prior
acts
for
which
there
is
not
even
a
conviction
in
terms
of
determining
a
sentence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
what
makes
this
particular
prior
conviction
less
reliable
than
that
kind
of
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
now
it's
not
unconstitutional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
nothing
unlawful
about
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
have
any
authority,
social
science
authority
or
otherwise
for
the
proposition
that
uncounseled
misdemeanor
convictions
are
unreliable
in
general?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
a
speculative
nature.
i
mean,
are
there
any
studies
that
show
that
uncounseled
convictions
are
inherently
unreliable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
wouldn't
be
an
equally
bright
line
rule
to
say
that
uncounseled
misdemeanor
offenses
that
are
not
unconstitutional
may
be
used
in
subsequent
sentencing
for
a
subsequent
offense?
