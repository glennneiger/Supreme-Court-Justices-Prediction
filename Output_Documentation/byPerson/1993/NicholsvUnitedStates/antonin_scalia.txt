maybe
this
is
same--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
does
the
waiver
of
it
make
the
result
more
reliable?
i
mean,
i
can
see
how
the
waiver
of
it
may...
the
failure
to
waive
it
properly
may
render
that
particular
proceeding
without
a
lawyer
unconstitutional,
but
i
don't
see
how
the
waiving
of
it
makes
the
result
more
reliable.
all
it
proves
is
that
you
have
a
foolish
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
talking
about
unconstitutionality
here.
i
don't
know...
you
seem
to
accept
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
making
this
retroactively
unconstitutional.
we
don't
have
to
do
that.
we
say
it
was
constitutional
when
rendered,
it
remains
constitutional
but
it
simply
cannot
constitutionally
be
used
as
the
basis
for
a
later
sentence.
that
is
not
retroactively
making
it
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
don't
do
it,
except
for
the
reason
that
it's
true.
we're
not
saying
it's
retroactively
unconstitutional.
it
was
valid--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
in
that
case
why
is
it
that
you're
willing
to
accept
a
waiver?
it
seems
to
me
the
logic
of
your
position
is
that
even
with
a
waiver
it's
not
reliable.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
the
waiver
make
it
reliable?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
for
purposes
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
original
proceeding,
not
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether
the
result
of
that
proceeding
is
reliable.
that's
a
totally
different
question
we
have
before
us.
now,
i
don't
see
how
the
waiver
bears
at
all
upon
whether
the
result
is
reliable.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
an
idiotic
defendant
who
waives
counsel,
says
i
waive
it,
yes,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that...
under
the
guidelines
it
refers
to
civil
adjudications?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
a
default
judgment
would
be
considered
an
adjudication?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
ought
to
be,
because
otherwise
it's
really
not
germane,
is
it?
isn't
this...
what
happened
here
the
equivalent
of
a
default
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
nolo
contendere.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
different
from
admitting--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
had
notice,
i
just
chose
not
to
appear
and
a
default
judgment
was
taken
against
me.
