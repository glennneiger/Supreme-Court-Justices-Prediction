mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
a
valid
uncounseled
misdemeanor
conviction
can
be
used
for
sentence
enhancement
even
if
it
could
not
support
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
in
its
own
right.
and
we
base
this
contention
on
three
propositions.
first,
a
particular
factor
does
not
need
to
be
sufficient
to
support
a
criminal
conviction
and
imprisonment
in
order
to
be
used
at
sentencing.
second,
there
is
nothing
so
inherently
unreliable
about
a
valid
uncounseled
misdemeanor
conviction
that
would
bar
its
use
in
a
later
sentencing
proceeding.
and
third,
an
enhanced
sentence
for
a
second
offense
is
not
simply
an
additional
sentence
for
a
first
offense.
instead,
it's
a
sentence
for
the
second
offense
that
is
imposed
on
a
person
who
has
a
criminal
record,
that
takes
account
of
the
fact
that
the
person
has
a
criminal
record.
now,
let
me
address
each
of
these
three
points
in
more
detail.
first,
it's
a
well-settled
principle
of
sentencing
law
that
this
court
has
reiterated
again
and
again,
that
the
court
in
sentencing
may
consider
a
very
broad
range
of
factors.
just
because
a
particular
factor
would
not
have
supported,
in
itself,
a
sentence
of
imprisonment,
doesn't
mean
it
can't
be
used
at
sentencing.
and
this--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
constitutionally
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference.
and
for
this
reason,
because
it...
suppose
a
judge
were
to
say
i
would
have
let
you...
i
would
have
given
you
probation,
but
i
see
that
you
have
this
on
your
record
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
give
you
2
years;
that's
a
discretionary
call
by
the
judge.
it's
exactly
the
same,
we
submit,
as
having
a
guidelines
system
or
some
other
system
of
guided
discretion
that
tells
the
judge
that
for
a
first
offense
you
should
give
an
extra
2
years.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
he
doesn't
have
discretion
under
the
guidelines
to
do
that,
that's
true.
but
as
this
court
said
in
dunnigan--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
but,
your
honor,
this
is
precisely
the
point
that
the
court
addressed
in
the
dunnigan
opinion,
in
which
it
said
there
can't
be
a
difference
between
a
decision
that's
made
within
the
discretionary
system
and
a
decision
that
is
made
as
a
result
of
a
guided
discretion
direction
to
take
a
particular
factor
into
account.
and
that...
that's
what
the
court
said
with
respect
to
a
perjury
enhancement
that
was
required
by
the
guidelines.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
i'm
doubtful
that
the
guidelines'
provision
for
departure,
which
is
section
4a1.3,
was
designed
to
permit
a
hearing
in
every
case
over
whether
the
particular
prior
convictions
were
in
fact
convictions
that
result...
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
there
may
be
extreme
cases
in
which
that
would
be
a
permissible
application
of
4a1.3.
not,
i
think,
a
routine
practice
of
coming
in
and
saying
i
didn't
do
any
of
these,
i
just
didn't
do
them
and
i
was
railroaded
in
every
single
case.
that
would,
i
think,
be
an
improper
application
of
that
departure.
there
may
be
extreme
cases
where
somebody
comes
in
and
says
that,
look,
there
was
a
sheriff
there
who
produced
all
of
these
traffic
warrants
against
me,
and
they
were
all
adjudicated
against
me
without
my
notice
and
they
were
adjudicated
as
default
judgments,
and
none
of
them
are
any
good
because
it
was
done
purely
as
a
matter
of
spite.
that
sort
of
thing,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
at
least.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think
that,
in
the
typical
case,
would
be
admissable.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and,
in
any
event,
there
was
no
such
suggestion
here.
there
was...
this
material
was
in--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i'm
doubtful
that
that
would
support
a
departure.
now,
in
this
case--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--within
the
guidelines
range,
as
counsel
has--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
i
doubt
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
suspect...
at
least
if
the
court
adopted
the
position
of
the
concurring
justices
in
baldasar,
the
conviction
would
be
out
of
bounds
for
any
purpose
that
could
result
in
an
enhancement
of
the
term
of
imprisonment.
and,
of
course,
a
decision
to
increase
the
range
or
increase
the
sentence
within
the
guidelines
range
would
be
such
an
enhancement
of
imprisonment.
so
i
don't
think
there
can
be
a
distinction
drawn
between
adding
one
point
that
throws
you
into
a
new
offense
level--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--or
criminal
history
level,
and
just
allowing
it
to
be
considered
within
the
guidelines
range.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
guidelines
range
is
25
months,
so
the
judge...
if
the
one
impermissible
misdemeanor
conviction
throws
you
up
by
25
months
it's
exactly
the
same
outcome
that
occurred
here
by
changing
the
criminal
history,
so
i
don't
think
there
could
be
a
distinction
on
that
ground.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
your
honor.
it
is...
the
answer
is
that
it
would
be
improper
to
introduce
the
conviction
if
the
conviction
could
result
in
an
enhancement
of
the
time
of
imprisonment.
but
it
would
not...
and
it
would
never,
in
any
event,
be
improper
to
introduce
evidence
of
the
underlying
activity.
so
that's
the
distinction.
now,
to
go
back
to
the
points
that
i
think
really
point
the
way
here
for
how
an
uncounseled
by
valid
misdemeanor
conviction
should
be
regarded,
it
is
something
that
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
different
contexts,
that
there
are
a
variety
of
considerations
for
sentencing
that
are
perfectly
inbounds
to
be
considered
and
that
can
result
in
enhancement
of
sentence,
even
though
they
could
not
possibly
have
supported
a
term
of
imprisonment,
or
for
that
matter
even
a
criminal
conviction,
standing
by
themselves.
in
this
court's
own
cases,
in
cases
such
as
the
williams
case
involving
uncharged
conduct,
cases
involving
the
failure
to
cooperate
with
the
authorities,
cases
involving
perjury
that
is
found
by
a
judge
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
cases
involving
say
the
use
of
a
weapon
during
the
course
of
the
commission
of
a
felony,
all--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
the
uncharged
conduct
referred
to
in
williams
of
course
referred
to
uncharged
other
activities
of
the
defendant
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
particular
conduct
that's
at
issue
in
the
case
on
trial,
so
the
answer
would
be
in
some
cases
yes,
in
other
cases
no.
and
we
think
it
makes
no
difference,
because
what
we're
looking
here
at
constitutionally
is
the
authority
of
a
judge
to
make
a
determination
not
only
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
offense,
all
the
circumstances
of
the
offense,
but
the
kind
of
person
the
judge
has
before
him.
and
the...
that
person
may
be
someone
who
his
a
first-time
offender
and
therefore
the
kind
of
person
that
we
typically
extend
leniency
to,
or
that
person
may
be
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
on
other
occasions
and
as
to
whom
we
don't
extend
leniency.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
a
difference
for
constitutional
purposes.
again,
i
come
back
to
the
answer
that
i
gave
referring
to
the
dunnigan
case,
and
again
repeated
in
the
mcmillan
case,
mcmillan
against
pennsylvania,
that
if
the
judge
is
saying
i
see
on
this...
based
on
this
factor,
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
higher
sentence,
there
can't
be
a
constitutional
difference
between
that
determination,
even
though
made
as
a
discretionary
matter,
and
a
determination
that
a
person
who
has
that
factor
will
get
a
higher
sentence
made
as
a
matter
of
the
sentencing
commission's
determination
or
congress'.
it's
the
same
thing
for
constitutional
purposes,
we
submit.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they
are
in
the
guidelines.
the
guidelines
makes
it
quite
clear
that
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere
is
the
same.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and,
in
fact,
in
georgia
where,
of
course,
this
plea
was
entered.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there's
a
specific
statute
that
provides
that
the
nolo
contendere
plea
can
be
used
in
aggravation
of
later
sentences,
and
the
court...
georgia
courts
have
held
that
it
may
be
used
in
recidivism
proceedings.
so
it's--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
theory,
your
honor,
is
that
you
can't
use
it
in
a
civil
proceeding.
and,
in
fact,
the
reason
that
you
have
nolo
contendere
pleas
in
georgia
in
these
kinds
of
cases
is
because
it
can't
be
used
to
revoke
your
driver's
license,
which
is
often
a
matter
of
great
concern.
but
there...
it
is
quite
clear
in
georgia
law
that
as
liberal
as
georgia
is
in
granting
relief
to
someone
who
has
pled
nolo
contendere,
the...
it
does
not
give
them
protection
against
the
use
for
aggravation
or
in
recidivism
proceedings.
now,
let
me
turn
next
to
the
reliability
point.
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
that
is
so
unreliable
about
a
valid
misdemeanor
conviction
that
makes
it
unusable
at
a
sentencing
proceeding.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
is
no
requirement
under
rule
11
that
a
defendant
be
notified.
and
this
is
even
in
federal
court
under
the
rule,
never
mind
the
constitutional
requirements.
but
there's
no
requirement
that
the
defendant
be
advised
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
his
plea
may
be
that
down
the
line,
if
he
should
commit
another
crime,
he
will
be
subject
to
a
higher
sentence
based
on
either
a
recidivism
statute
or
some
kind
of
aggravation
system
such
as
the
sentencing
guidelines.
that
is
not
in
the
rule
11
colloquy
requirements.
and
there's
a
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
and
this
goes
to
notice.
not
only--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but,
your
honor,
in
this
kind
of
setting
it
is...
it
is
probably
the
most
basic
principle
of...
i
think
of
sentencing
that
is
understood
by
every
16-year-old
that
has
ever
stood
before
a
juvenile
court
judge
or
justice
of
the
peace,
where
the
court
says
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
break
this
time,
but
i
never
want
to
see
you
back
here
and
if
i
do
i'm
going
to
throw
the
book
at
you.
people
understand
that
if
you
do
it
once
you
might
get
off
lightly;
if
you
do
it
again,
they're
going
to
hit
you
harder.
and
the
reason
is
they're
going
to
say...
they're
going
to
look
back
and
they
say
a-ha,
you
were
here
before,
now
we're
going
to
hit
you
harder.
that
isn't
something
that
most
people
need
to
be
told
in
order
to
understand.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
part
of
our
legal
culture.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i
just
think
it
is...
it
is
just
something
that
is...
is
so
familiar
to
us
that
you...
there
are
any
number
of
different
risk--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
but
you
also
didn't
refer,
for
example,
to
the
possible
effect
of
a
conviction
on
employment,
on
other...
sorry,
on
whether
you
could
be
a
public
official.
there
certainly
are
lots
of
collateral
consequences
of
even
a
misdemeanor
conviction
which...
all
of
which
are
valid
save
one,
which
is
you
may
not
send
somebody
to
prison
for
an
uncounseled
valid
misdemeanor
conviction.
you
just
can't...
that's
the
one
thing
you
can't
do.
now,
included
in
all
of
the
things
you
can
do,
we
submit,
are
that
you
may
consider
the
valid
uncounseled
misdemeanor
conviction
as
indicating
that
the
person
has
a
criminal
history.
and
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
case
that
i
think
makes
this
point.
the...
suppose
you
have
a
case
where
someone
is
running
a
fraudulent
boiler
room
operation
and
the
state
gets
onto
them
and
catches
them
at
it
and
they
decide,
well,
this
is
the
first
time
so
we're
just
going
to
proceed
against
you
civilly.
and
they
get
a
civil...
they
bring
a
civil
action
and
they
get
a
civil
judgment
with
an
injunction.
the
person
isn't
entitled
to
a
lawyer
and
decides
not
to
have
a
lawyer
at
that
proceeding.
so
he
has
a
civil...
a
civil
judgment
against
him
for
this.
the
second
time...
he
goes
right
out
and
he
does
it
again.
the
second
time
the
state
catches
him
and
says
this
time
we're
not
going
to
be
so
nice,
we're
going
to
prosecute
you.
he
goes
before
a
court
and
the
judge
says
i
would
have
given
you
probation
for
this
criminal
act,
but
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
now
because
i
see...
based
on
this
civil
judgment
for
which
the
defendant
did
not
have
a
lawyer,
i
regard
that
as
a
reliable
indication
that
you
are
effectively
a
second-time
offender
in
this...
in
this
activity
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
give
you
jail
time.
there's
nothing
conceivably
wrong
with
that.
there's
no
sixth
amendment
violation,
there's
no
unreliability
concern.
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
no
one
would
blink
at
considering.
now,
this
case
follow
a
fortiori
from
that
case,
because
in
this
case
there
was
even
more
to
be
said
for
the
reliability,
if
you
will,
of
the
misdemeanor
conviction
since
it
had
to
be
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
he
was
entitled
to
confrontation
rights,
and
he
was
entitled
to
compulsory
process.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
your
honor.
i
think
burgett
is
fundamentally
different,
and
that
is
because
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
in
burgett.
the
court
said
there
are
two
reasons
that
you
can't
consider
this
prior
uncounseled
felony
conviction
for
enhancement
purposes.
one,
it
just...
it
would
eviscerate
the
rule
of
gideon,
which
means...
which
is
that
you
cannot
have
a
valid
felony
conviction
without
a
lawyer
or
waiver
of
lawyer.
plus,
it
would
work
an
additional
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
use
this
void
conviction
in
an
enhancement
proceeding.
neither
of
those
factors
is
present
here.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
there's
no
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
my
misdemeanor
case,
just
as
there's
no
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
the
civil
case.
the
conviction
is
as
valid.
the
misdemeanor
conviction
is
as
valid
as
that
civil
judgment.
and
once
it's
determined
that
it's
valid,
there's
no
reason
not
to
apply
it,
there's
no
reason
not
to
say
this
is
good
enough
to
establish
the
fact
of
a
criminal
history,
which
is
all
we're
using
it
for.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
in
my
hypothetical
i'm
positing
that
the
judge
is
looking
at
the
judgment,
not
at
the
conduct.
not
looking
behind
the
judgment,
but
simply
saying
i
see
you
have
a
judgment
here
for
fraud
based
on
the
boiler
room
activities
that
you
engaged
in.
never
mind
going
back
and
reintroducing
evidence
of
all
of
that;
it's
enough
that
there
is
such
a
judgment
on
the
books
and
that
the
judge
can
rely
on
it.
and
that
would
not,
we
submit,
create
any
constitutional
problem.
mr.

the
guidelines
provide
for
using
civil
adjudications
as
a
basis
for
departure.
i
think
that's
in
4a1.3.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
it's
limited
to
convictions.
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right.
it
can
certainly...
it
can
certainly
lead
to
a
change
of
the
sentence
within
the
guidelines
range,
and
it
can
even
lead
to
a
departure
in
an
appropriate
case.
and
there
is
the
specific
provision
in
the
departure
guideline
on
that
point,
authorizing
the
use
of
an
adjudication;
not
simply
conduct,
but
an
actual
adjudication.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
certainly,
your
honor.
and
yet
we
submit
that
in
the
average
case
it's
very
hard
to
find
a
constitutional
principle
that
would
say
you
simply
may
not
use
a
civil
judgment
that
is
perfectly
valid
in
all
respects,
that
we
understand
the
typical
civil
judgment
to
be,
that
you
simply
can't
use
it
for
this
one
purpose
of
enhancement
of
sentence.
because
all
we're
doing
here...
and
i
think
this
is
really
important
to
focus
on--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--certainly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right,
because
it
wouldn't
say
anything
about
the
person,
presumably.
but
where
you
have
an
in
personam
judgment
that...
the
basis
of
which
is...
the
essence
of
the
ultimate
judgment
order
is
that
this
person
has
been
found
to
have
engaged
in
this
conduct,
that
is,
we
submit,
sufficiently
reliable
for
constitutional
purposes
to
justify
the
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
sentencing
court
that
this
person
has
a
background
of
this
kind
of
activity
and
for
that
reason
is
not
the
kind
of
person
who
is
entitled
to
lenient
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
courts.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
a
default
judgment...
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
he
was
there.
i
mean
he
walked
in
and
effectively
admitted...
or
at
least
indicated
that
he
was
not
going
to
contest
the
state's
proof
in
this
case.
this
is
very
different
from
a
situation
where
he
did
not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--have
actual
notice.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
it's
not,
we
submit,
very
different
from
admitting.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
in
this
case
he
had
full
notice
and
we
know
from
the
presentence
report,
in
fact,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
he
actually
consulted
a
lawyer
who
suggested
that
since
he
really
wasn't
going
to
contest
the
case
and
the
arrangement
sounded
acceptable,
no
reason
to
bring
a
lawyer
with
him.
now,
the
final
point
that
i
think
is
worth
making
on
this
score
is
that
it
has
to
be
emphasized
that
the
penalty
for...
in
an
enhanced
setting,
in
an
enhanced
sentence
setting,
the
penalty
is
for
the
second
offense,
not
the
first.
now,
justice
marshall
in
his
concurrence
conceded
as
much,
but
then
went
on
to
argue
in
a...
make
an
argument
that
has
some
intuitive
appeal
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i'm
sorry,
in
baldasar.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor...
made
the
argument
that
the
fact
that
you
can't
directly
impose
an
extra
term
of...
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
a
misdemeanor
conviction
is
inconsistent
with
allowing
you
indirectly
to
impose
it
by
using
that
misdemeanor
conviction
at
sentencing
for
another
crime.
and
if
you
can't
do
it
directly,
you
can't
do
it
indirectly.
but
that
i
think
overlooks
the
fundamental
difference
between
sentencing
somebody
for
a
crime
and
sentencing
somebody
for
a
later
crime
in
which
you
are
using
the
fact
of
the
prior
conviction,
not
to
give
them
extra
time
because
of...
as
a
means...
as
a
mode
of
punishing
them
for
the
first
conviction,
but
rather
to
use
as
a
fact
the
fact
that
this
person
has
a
criminal
history.
and
let
me
just
use
another
hypothetical,
if
i
may,
to
try
to
demonstrate
that
point.
suppose
you
have
someone
who
is
convicted
of
rape.
and
under
coker
against
georgia,
that
could
not
lead
to
a
sentence
of
death,
we
know
that.
suppose
that
subsequently
that
person
commits
murder
and
the
determination
of
the
sentencer
is
based
on
the
fact
of
the
murder
and,
as
an
aggravating
circumstance,
the
fact
of
the
rape,
you
are
going
to
get
the
death
penalty.
now,
in
that
setting
it
could
be
said...
to
follow
justice
marshall's
analysis,
it
could
be
said
that
the
rape,
in
effect,
resulted
in
the
death
penalty.
and
yet
we
know
that
that
isn't
a
punishment
for
the
rape.
that
is
a
punishment
for
the
murder,
which
is
authorized...
the
death
penalty
is
authorized
because
the
person
has
a
history
of
violent
crime.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i'm
getting
away
from
the
question
of
counsel
here
and
just
asking...
addressing
right
now
the
question
of
whether
there
is
force
to
the
logic
that
was
at
the
base
of
the
concurring
opinions
in...
of
justice
marshall
and
justice--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
yes,
but
it's
clear...
the
one
thing
that
is
quite
clear
is
that
you
may
do,
with
respect
to
the
second
penal...
punishment
proceeding,
something
that
you
could
not
have
done
with
respect
only
to
the
first.
and
that's
my
only
point
with
respect
to
the
hypothetical.
it
does,
i
think,
demonstrate
that
point.
finally,
i
think
to
look
at
the
question
of
the
importance
of
this
issue.
counsel
suggests
that
this
really
isn't
all
that
important
and
that
the
states
can
live
with
it.
well,
of
course
the
states
can
live
with
it.
if
you
tell
them
they
have
to
live
with
it,
they
will.
but
i
think
it's...
it's,
in
fact,
very
important
that
the
states
be
able
to
conduct
recidivism
programs,
and
to
the
extent
that
we
do,
that
the
united
states
be
able
to
do
that,
in
which
you
do
give
leniency
to
someone
who
is
a
first-time
offender,
in
which
you
do
take
account
of
the
fact
that
the
person
has
a
criminal
record
when
they
come
back
and
they
do
it
again,
and
that
you
do
sentence
those
people
much
more
harshly
than
you
would
the
first
offenders.
what,
in
effect,
the
rule
of
baldasar,
if
extended
to
this
case,
would
do
is
to
say
that
everyone,
at
least
everyone
who
didn't
bring
a
lawyer
with
them
to
a
misdemeanor...
a
prior
misdemeanor
proceeding,
or
who
didn't
have
the
state
appoint
them
a
lawyer
for
every
misdemeanor...
everyone
is
to
be
treated
as
a
first
offender
every
time.
and
drunk
driving
is
a
perfect
example
of
where
we
say,
well,
first
time
a
fine,
second
time
a
heavier
fine,
third
time
jail.
and
yet
if
you
follow
the
theory
of
baldasar
into
this
setting,
what
you're
saying
is
there's
never
a
second
time
and
there's
never
a
third
time
unless,
of
course,
the
state
decides
to
provide
everybody
with
a
lawyer,
even
if
they're
only
going
to
have
a
$250
fine,
as
in
this
case.
and
we
think
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
require
that.
thank
you.
