argument
next
in
no.
92-8556,
kenneth
o.
nichols
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
carter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say...
you
talk
as
though
there's
some
sort
of
a
springing
use
concept,
that
the
conviction
wasn't
unconstitutional
initially.
are
you
suggesting
that
it
later
becomes
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they've
have
a
right...
would
they
have
a
right
to
appointed
counsel
if
they
chose
to
contest
the
thing
across
the
board
and
not
simply
agree
to
pay
a
fine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
they're
unreliable
and
therefore
that
the
person
not
only
chose
to
pay
the
fine,
but
chose
to
pay
the
fine
when
he
could
have
defended...
successfully
defended
the
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
reason
do
you
have
for
thinking
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
anything...
anything
other
than
your
own
personal
experience?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
basis
for
gideon
and
argersinger
and
scott
was
reliability?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
they
were
heavily
relied
on,
say,
in
gideon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
in
the
opinion.
i
don't
mean
in
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--unspoken
minds
of
the
justices.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
that
would
be
contrary
to
scott
if
you
allowed
that,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
when
you
say
the
court
held,
there
was
no
court
opinion
in
baldasar,
was
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
there
any
lowest
common
denominator
that
represented
the
views
of
five
justices?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
were
there...
was
there
a
line
of
reasoning
supported
by
a
majority
of
the
justices?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
case
is
not...
is
not
binding
precedent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
under
our
decisions
is
it
or
is
it
not
binding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
quite
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
state
courts
on
the
baldasar
point.
to
say
the
state
courts
are
working
with
it
certainly...
i
hope
you're
not
trying
to
suggest
that
they've
come
out
unanimously.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they've
split
quite
dramatically.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
carter.
mr.
bryson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
his
concurrence
in
what
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
baldasar.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
carter,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carter.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
92-8556,
nichols
against
the
united
states.
in
this
case
the
petitioner,
nichols,
was
convicted
of
a
felony
drug
offense
and
when
it
came
time
to
sentence
him,
the
district
court
following
the
sentencing
guidelines
took
into
consideration
his
previous
misdemeanor
conviction
for
driving
under
the
influence.
the
petitioner
objected
because
he
had
not
been
furnished
a
lawyer
to
represent
him
in
the
misdemeanor
proceeding.
the
district
court
rejected
this
argument
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court.
it
is
clear
under
our
decision
in
scott
versus
illinois
that
petitioner's
earlier
misdemeanor
conviction
was
constitutionally
valid
because
he
received
only
a
fine
and
no
jail
time.
but
the
use
of
the
conviction
to
increase
his
sentence
for
his
current
felony
drug
conviction
has
been
a
matter
of
dispute
in
lower
federal
courts
and
state
courts.
in
the
case
of
baldasar
against
illinois,
a
five
to
four
majority
of
this
court
held
that
a
prior
uncounseled
misdemeanor
conviction,
even
though
constitutional
under
scott,
could
not
be
used
to
augment
a
second
misdemeanor
conviction
so
that
it
would
be
a
felony
under
the
applicable
state
sentencing
statute.
baldasar
was
a
splintered
decision
that
produced
three
separate
opinions
for
the
result
reached
by
the
majority
without
any
common
reasoning,
and
today
we
overrule
that
case
and
adapt
the
views
of
the
dissenters
there.
we
adhere
to
the
principle
announced
in
scott
versus
illinois
that
an
uncounseled
misdemeanor
conviction
that
results
in
no
jail
time
is
a
constitutional
conviction.
and
a
logical
consequence
of
this
rule
is
that
an
uncounseled
conviction
valid
under
scott
may
be
relied
upon
to
enhance
the
sentence
for
a
subsequent
offense
even
though
that
sentence
entails
imprisonment.
sentencing
enhancement
statutes
which
seek
to
punish
repeat
offenders
more
harshly
do
not
change
the
penalty
imposed
from
the
earlier
conviction.
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
join.
