mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
kenneth
nichols,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
was
convicted
in
1990
in
the
eastern
district
of
tennessee
with
conspiracy
to
distribute
cocaine.
he
was
sentenced
under
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines.
when
the
presentence
report
was
prepared,
his
prior
criminal
history
indicated
that
he
was
to
receive
three
points
for
a
1983
conviction
that
was
late
in
1983,
in
december,
for
a
drug-related
offense.
in
additional
to
that
criminal
history
point,
he
received
one
criminal
history
point
for
an
uncounseled
prior
misdemeanor
conviction
for
dui.
he
received
in
that
dui
sentence
a
sentence
of
a
$250
fine,
dui
school,
and
no
term
of
imprisonment.
he
faced
in
that
case
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
up
to
11
months
and
29
days
in
jail.
the
probation
officer's
report,
which
was
presented
to
the
court
and
on
which
the
district
court
relied,
indicated
that
there
was
no
information
available
from
the
court
record
in
georgia
whether
the
defendant
was
represented
by
an
attorney.
the
defendant,
or
petitioner
nichols,
also
told
the
presentence
officer
that
he
had
gone
to
see
some
lawyer.
the
lawyer
told
him
that
if
you're
just
going
to
plead
nolo
contendere
in
that
georgia
misdemeanor
case,
you
don't
need
a
lawyer.
the
district
judge
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
there
was
no
counsel
at
the
1983
dui
conviction,
noting
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
other
than
the
testimony
of
mr.
nichols.
it
was
not
contested
that
there
was
no
counsel.
the
district
judge
further
found
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
the
record,
that
is
the
presentence
report,
that
there
was
no
valid
waiver
of
counsel
shown
on
the
georgia
dui
conviction.
on
the
basis
of
his
experience
with...
dealing
with
the
presentence
officers
and
his
confidence
in
them
he,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
found
that
this
was
an
uncounseled
dui
conviction
for
which--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
that
is--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--under
the
holding
of
scott,
your
honor,
that
dui
conviction
was
not
unconstitutional
at
the
time
it
was
imposed--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--and
i
accept
that,
but
for
the
limited
reason
that
there
was
no
fine,
or
rather
no
term
of
imprisonment
or
incarceration.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
under
the
guidelines
a
judge
is
entitled...
a
district
judge
is
entitled
and
required
to
consider,
to
hear,
and
to
weigh
such
evidence
to
determine
what
impact
it
should
have.
the
thing
that
i
believe
is--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
thing
that
makes
this
conviction
more
unreliable...
it's
really
not
a
question
of
making
it
quite
more
unreliable,
as
it
is
making
it
more
improper
to
use...
is
the
fact
that
under
the
federal
sentencing
guide--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--it
isn't
initially.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
no,
your
honor,
not
initially
for
the
limited
purpose
of
giving
him
a
money
fine.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
i
am,
your
honor.
and
i
recognize
that
this
court
in
the
dissent
in
baldasar
was
concerned
that
this
was
creating
or
might
create
or
does
create,
and
i
think
it
does,
a
hybrid
conviction
that
might
be
valid
for
some
purposes
and
yet
invalid
for
another.
and
today
what
i
want
to
try
to
convince
the
court
is...
is
that
there
is
a
very
good
reason,
based
on
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states,
why
that
is
a
very
good
and
appropriate
rule.
and
not
only
a
good
and
appropriate
rule,
but
a
rule
that
will
be
easy
for
our
federal
district
courts
to
apply,
that
will
give
the
weight
and
deference
the
sixth
amendment
deserves
and
yet
not
upset
our
system
of
law,
which
i
understand
this
court
is
very
concerned
with,
the
effect
of
holding
that
a
conviction
might
be
valid
for
one
purpose
and
not
for
another.
let
me
say--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--so
long
as
there
is
no
term
of
imprisonment,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
i
think
the
reason
why
it
is
un...
it
is
improper
is
because
of
its
unreliability.
the
history
of--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--well,
frankly,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
distinction
is...
is
that
of
incarceration.
i
think
they're
all
unreliable,
i
think
we're
just
willing
to
accept
the
unreliable...
unreliability
in
some
circumstances.
here--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--your
honor,
if
the
judge
had
a
weighing
and
sentencing...
in
the
sentencing
determination
was
able
to
himself
weigh
something
then
yes,
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
even
though
it's
initially
unreliable,
that
the
judge,
since
he
has
some
discretion,
could
decide
how
much
weight
to
give.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
i
think
it
is
true
that
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
the
judge
does...
if
he
finds
a
reason
which
he
articulates
and
which
will
stand
on
appeal,
that
he
can
depart.
however,
there
is
an
automatic--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--except
that
the
judge
does
not
have
an
option
to
determine
what
sentencing
range
it
is
within
which
he
is
to
be
sentenced.
he
automatically...
there
was
an
automatic
increase
from
range
two
to
range
three
because
of
this
one
criminal
history
point,
and
that
meant
nichols
was
sentenced
at
the
very
top
of
category
three
criminal
history
score
for
his
offense.
he
got
25
months--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--only
if
there
is
an
adequate
justification
for
that.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
well,
i
think
it
is
true
there
can
be
a
downward
departure.
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
very
basic
reason
why
these
kinds
of
convictions
are
unreliable,
and
i'd
like
to
speak
to
it,
if
i
could.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
subject
to,
of
course,
being
reversed
if
he
gave
undue
deference
or
weight
to
it.
but
i
think
that
the
important
distinction
in
this
case
is
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
have
brought
a
new
dimension
to
sentencing.
there
are
certain
things
where
there
is
no
discretion,
and
one
of
them
is
the
guideline
range.
the
guideline
range
does
automatically
increase
when
there
is...
when
there
is
the
use,
for
instance,
of
this
prior
uncounseled
misdemeanor.
now,
why
should
the
court
be
concerned
about
an
uncounseled
misdemeanor
where
there
is
only
a
money
fine?
the
reason
for
that
is,
i
think,
found
in
the
history
of
gideon
v.
wainwright,
argersinger,
where
the
court
found
first
that,
from
its
previous
decisions,
the
right
to
counsel
is
very
important.
even
an
educated
person
in
a
court
is
not
able
to
follow
all
the
rules
of
the
court,
is
not
able
to
understand
the
processes
of
the
court.
now,
what
happened
was
after
argersinger,
the
scott
v.
illinois
decision
gave
the
line,
the
clear
line
that
if
incarceration
was
involved,
then
the
conviction
was
unconstitutional
if
there
was
no
counsel.
if
there
was
incarceration,
there
simply
had
to
be
counsel.
now,
that
court...
in
my
view,
the
case
recognizes
the
fact
that
an
uncounseled
misdemeanor
is
inherently
unreliable.
day
in
and
day
out
in
the
counties
where...
in
the
county
where
i
practice,
and
i
think
all
over
the
country,
the
lower
courts,
the
sessions
courts,
the
municipal
courts,
hear
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases.
they
have
crowded
dockets.
they're
trying
to
move
their
cases
along.
what's
happened
with
scott
v.
illinois
is
that
we
have
created
a
type
of
case
where
an
individual
faced
with
an
offense
is
likely
to
opt
not
to
pay
for
a
lawyer,
if
they're
able
to
hire
one,
because
of
the
expense
of
doing
so,
because
all
they've
got
to
do
to
avoid
this
problem
is
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
the
initial
conviction
is
constitutional.
there
aren't
any
rights
waived.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
if
they
were
indigent,
they
would
have
the
right
to
find
appointed
counsel.
but
even
then,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
there
are
people,
because
they
fear
the
process,
because
they
find
that
there's
an
easy
way
to
resolve
this
case
just
by
paying
a
little
fine,
will
be
lulled
into
believing
that
there's
no
significance
to
it.
they
won't
have
been
read
their
rights,
they
won't
have
been
made
to
understand
that
what
they're
doing
is
something
significant.
now,
the
grave
danger
that
i
think
appears
here
is
that
we
will
be
allowing,
if
we
accept
that
once
it's
unconstitutional...
i
mean
rather
once
it's
constitutional
because
there's
only
a
money
fine,
if
we
do
not
say
that
it
later
becomes
unconstitutional
if
we're
trying
to
impose
incarceration,
is
that
we
will
be
relying
upon
thousands
of
convictions
which
are
inherently
unreliable
because
of
the
reality
of
life
out
there
in
the
court
system.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
that
can
happen.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
well,
your
honor,
experience.
i've
seen
it
in
people
in
juvenile
courts--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
my
personal
experience
and
i
think
the
court's
decisions
that
have...
in
gideon,
in
argersinger,
and
in
scott
that
have
noted
that
the
process...
we're
all
human
with
all
of
our
frailties
in
the
system.
we
have
to
run
it
with
humans,
and
we're
always
trying
to
make
it
as
reliable
as
possible.
and
i
think
those
cases
recognize
that
the
enhanced
reliability
is
needed
if
we're
going
to
impose
imprisonment
on
someone.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
well,
i
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
court--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--well,
perhaps
not.
i'm
not...
i
can't
tell
the
court
that
i
recall--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--right.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
i
believe
that
reliability
is
essentially
the
key
to
why
we
want
to
have
counsel,
is
that
counsel
makes
the
system
more
reliable
by
making
certain
that
the
accused
is
aware
of
the
significance
of
what
they're
doing.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
if
your
honor--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--your
honor,
i
believe
it
would
resolve
my
problem.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
do--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--if
there
is
a
facially
valid
waiver
of
counsel
indicating
on
the
face
of
the
document
that
the
rights
were
read,
that
the
defendant
waived
the
right,
then
i
think
that
that
does
enhance
the
reliability
of
the
conviction,
yes.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
did
not
hear--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--well,
it
makes
it
more
reliable--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--because
at
least
we
know
that
what
has
been
explained
to
the
man
is
that...
or
the
woman
who
faced
the
lower
court,
that
the
judge
took
the
time
to
explain
that
they
did
have
a
right
to
a
trial,
that
they
did
have
a
right
to
confront
the
witnesses.
it's
one
of
those
things
where
we
are--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--well,
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
is
perhaps
it
doesn't,
but
because
there
was
still
no
counsel.
but
we
have
long
recognized
that
a
person
has
a
right,
the
supreme
court
has,
to
waive
counsel,
and,
for
instance,
to
defend
themselves.
we
don't...
we
will...
once
the
individual...
it
has
been
explained
to
the
individual
that
they
have
that
right,
if
they
chose
to
do
it
then
they
have
the
right
to
do
it.
and
i
suppose
in
that
case
your
honor
is
probably
correct,
that
that
is...
since
there's
no
counsel,
perhaps
it
isn't
unreliable
in
a
factual
sense.
but
at
least
the
right
has
been
read
to
the
person,
they
are
aware
that
it
is
a
matter
of
consequence,
what
they're
doing
when
they're
in
the
lower
court
when
they're
entering
that
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
espouse
or
advance
a
rule
that
will
simply
say
that
when
the
federal
district
court
looks
at
a
prior
conviction,
a
prior
misdemeanor
conviction,
and
determines
there
was
no
term
of
imprisonment
given,
that
that
judge
then
looks
to
the
record...
which
is,
i
believe,
consistent
with
the
sentencing
guidelines
which
tries
to
look
to
the
conviction
record,
the
record
of
conviction
to
see
what
the
person's
criminal
history
score
is...
just
look
to
determine
if,
one,
there
was
a
lawyer,
or
if
there
was
a
lawyer
waived,
that
the
rights
were
read
to
the
individual.
and
all
that
needs
to
do
is
to
show
that
on
the
record.
now,
georgia
didn't
do
that.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
your
honor,
all
there
needs
to
be
is
a
facially
valid
waiver.
it
is
true,
even
if
there
is
a
facially
valid
waiver,
that
a
defendant
could
mount
a
collateral
attack
and
establish
enough
evidence
to
show
that
even
though
it
says
that
it
wasn't
valid...
but
we
don't
have
to
do
that
in
this
case.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
well,
that
would
require
that
that
be
done
prior
and
in
a
prior
event.
i
would...
it
would
not
be...
it
would
not
be
invalid
for
this
purpose,
you're
right,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
absolutely
correct.
under
scott
it
is
initially
a
valid...
a
valid
conviction.
now,
this
court--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--well,
i
think
that
under
the
guidelines
that
you
can,
within
the
sentencing
range,
take
into
account
conduct
to
determine
where
in
that
particular
range
that
it
can
fall
because
of
conduct.
but
what
we're
talking
about--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--right,
right.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
if
it
was...
if
it
was...
if
it
turned
out
that
the
judge,
in
his
discretion,
felt
that
it
was
reliable
after
hearing
evidence
about
the
conduct,
yes.
but
in
this
case
it
was
an
automatic
enhancement
of
sentencing
range
based
on
the
fact
that
there
was
this
uncounseled
misdemeanor.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
could
the
court
repeat
the
question?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
right,
should
not,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
i
think
that
he
could,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be...
i
think
that
that
would
be
within
his
discretion
under
the
guidelines.
what's
happened
here,
though,
is
there
was
an
automatic--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--yes,
your
honor,
but
he...
well,
no,
i
don't
think
he
would
be
deciding
whether
to
increase
the
criminal
history
score.
i
think
his
decision
would
be
where
in
the
lower
guideline
range.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
i
would
espouse
a
rule
that
says
you
don't
change
the
guideline
range
if
there
is
no
lawyer
or
if
there's
no
waiver
of
counsel.
now,
we're
basing
our
argument
on
baldasar.
baldasar,
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
was
a
case
that
had
some
striking
similarities
to
this
case.
baldasar
had
stolen
a
showerhead.
under
illinois
law
it
was
a
misdemeanor.
it
would
become,
under
their
statute,
a
felony
if
there
had
been
another
misdemeanor.
baldasar
had
a
prior
misdemeanor
conviction.
it
was
uncounseled,
there
was
only
a
money
fine.
same
situation.
the
court
there
held
that--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--that
is
correct.
there
were
concurring
opinions,
mr.
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
view
that
represents
the
views
of
the
five
justices
is
that
if
the
prior
misdemeanor
conviction
was
uncounseled,
even
though
there
was
only
a
money
fine,
that
if
that
prior
misdemeanor
conviction
was
for
an
offense
of
more
than
6
months,
more
than
a
petty
offense
as
justice
blackmun
said,
then
i
think
that
that
is
unconstitutional
and
cannot
be
used
to
change
the...
automatically
change
the
sentencing
guideline
range
in
this
case.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
your
honor,
i
have
to
combine
the
reasoning,
as
the
court
knows.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
your
honor,
i
think
not
only...
i
think
it
should
be
binding
precedent.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
the
lowest
common
denominator
that,
under
marks,
could
be
found
to
be
binding
precedent,
but
i'm...
i
will
leave
that
to
the
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
well,
your
honor,
i
have
finally
reached
the
court
where
you
can
always
overrule,
so
i
certainly
know
that
it
can
be
overruled.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
no,
your
honor,
you're
not
ever
totally
bound.
but
i
think
that
the
case
is
a
good
case
because
i
think
that
it
recognizes
that
there
is
an
inherent
unreliability
if
we
allow
all
these
petty
offenses
where
no
rights
had
to
be
read
by
anybody...
they
don't
have
to
be
told
anything.
what
we're
allowing
to
happen
is
to
allow
convictions
to
occur
that
are
unreliable.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
and
why
should
it
become
more
reliable
later?
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
the
reason
it
doesn't
make
it
unconstitutional
is
because
under
scott
it
wasn't
unconstitutional,
even
though
there
was
no
lawyer.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
your
honor,
i'll
certainly
accept
that
interpretation.
that...
i
certainly
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
arguing
it
is.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
well,
i
mean
boykin--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--boykin
v.
alabama
talked
about
the
fact
that
there
needs
to
be
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
i
think
we
have
our--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--i
think--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--i
don't
disagree
with
your
honor
that
the
reliability
is
enhanced
when
there's
a
lawyer.
i
think
that
that's
right.
and
what
your
honor
is
pointing
out
to
me
is,
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
there's
a
waiver?
well,
what
i
guess
i'm
doing
is
saying...
is
saying
the
reality
of
it
is
we
cannot
force
a
person
to
have
a
lawyer;
this
court
has
said
you
don't
have
to.
and
so
what
we're
saying
is
that
what
we're
offering
as
a
court
system
is
to
make
it
reliable.
but
if
you,
a
defendant,
ultimately,
after
being
advised
of
your
right,
want
to
waive
it
and
want
to
proceed
without
counsel,
then
we
as
a
system
have
done
all
that
we
can.
and
what
i
am
espousing
or
advancing
is
a
rule
that
simply
follows
baldasar,
that
says
here
is
a
minor
offense
for
which
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty
with
no
lawyer,
inherently
unreliable,
and
that's
what
i
feel
that
it
is.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
your
honor,
the
only
authority
that
i
can
recall
from
my
reading
is...
i
believe
i
am
recalling
correctly
that
in
argersinger
and
in
scott
there
were
discussions
of
the
fact
that
it
is--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--your
honor,
i
do
not
presently,
as
i
stand
here,
have
such.
i
was
persuaded
much
by
the
language
of
the
courts
there,
that
it
is
unreliable,
that
it
increases
the
reliability.
i
don't
want
it
to...
i
don't
think
it's
a
fiction.
that
is
i
think
it
is...
is
really
true
that
sometimes
people,
in
order
to
avoid
prison
sentence,
in
order
to
do
the
easy
thing,
might
well
pay
a
fine
and
go
their
way,
and
years
later
we
would
have
to
go
back
and
be
looking
at
these
things.
the
advantage
of
the
rule
espoused
here,
the
bright
line
rule
that
all
you
do
is
go
and
look
at
the
record,
is
the
federal
courts
then
don't
have
to
hold
extensive
hearings
to
determine
what
happened
8
or
9
years
ago.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
your
honor,
it
would
be
an
equally
bright
line
rule
for
you
to
say
that,
but
it
would
be
an
equally
bright
line
rule
that
ignores
the
inherent
unreliability
of
uncounseled
misdemeanors.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
because
i'm
a
little
bit
fearful
as
to
whether
this
court
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
we
ought
to
have
fair
notice.
but,
your
honor,
i
must
tell
you,
i
think
that
would
be...
fair
notice
would
be
appropriate.
that
is
that
personally
i
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate,
when
waiver
is
read,
to
say
this
little
conviction
here
can
also
be
used
later.
i
think
this
court...
i
don't
know
if
this
court
would
be...
wants
to
go
that
far,
but
i
think
that
that
is
a...
i
think
that
that
would
also
enhance
reliability
of
the
conviction,
i
think
that
would
also
protect
the
interests
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
i
think
that
would
also
still
be
a
clear
bright
line
rule,
easy
to
apply.
the
federal
courts
wouldn't
be
bogged
down
trying
to
find
out
what
happened
8,
10,
15
years
ago
in
a
prior
conviction.
it
would
be
a
clear
rule
and,
i
think,
consistent
with
the
constitution.
and
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
there
is
a
hybrid
offense
created
is
a
problem.
if
the
court...
juvenile
adjudications,
for
instance.
for
years
in
my
practice
i
was
used
to
the
fact
that
juvenile
adjudications
were
available,
you
know,
in
juvenile
court,
but
you
couldn't
use
them
later
in
adult
court.
now
i
know
the
rules
changes
sometimes,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there
has
been
a
long
time
where
we
worked
with
that.
the
states
are
working
with
this
rule.
i
think
basically
the
states
have
interpreted
baldasar
in
a
broad
way.
they're
working
with
it
all
right.
will
it
really
hurt
much?
in
most
convictions
like
dui's
all
over
the
country,
a
lot
of
states
have
imposed
imprisonment
for
the
first
offense.
well,
of
course--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--oh,
heaven's
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
i'm
trying--
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
--i
think
that
they've
split
less
than
the
federal
courts
have,
is
really
what
i
guess
i
would
have
to
say.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
if
i
may
reserve
my...
any
remaining
time
i
have,
unless
the
court
has
more
questions.
mr.
william
b.
m.
carter
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
structure
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
have
made
convictions
very
different
from
prior
conduct.
prior
conduct
can
be
used
to
change
the
sentence
within
the
range,
but
not
to
automatically
enhance
to
a
different
range,
and
that
is
a
distinct...
the
distinction
of
this
case.
this
case
is
like
baldasar
in
that
sense;
it
increased
automatically
to
a
higher
range.
now,
original
convictions...
the
original
conviction
in
georgia
was
constitutional,
but
it
wasn't
constitutional
for
all
purposes.
that's
so
even
under
scott.
and
we
think
that
there
are
examples...
i
mentioned
that
the
criminal...
the
juvenile
adjudication
is
an
example
of
that,
where
an
offense
was
valid
for
one
purpose
and
not
for
another.
i
believe
it
was
lewis,
lewis
v.
united
states,
where
the
court
had
a
situation
where
someone
had
a
prior
felony
uncounseled
which
clearly
would
have
been
not
useable
for
many
purposes,
but
it
was
used
for
the
limited
purpose
of
preventing
somebody
the
status
of
not
possessing
a
pistol
or
not
possessing
a
weapon
of
some
kind.
that
is
an
obvious
example
also
of
offenses
being
used
for
different
purposes.
i
believe
that
in
this
case
a
rule
that
recognizes
that
this
offense
is
not
reliable
and
perhaps
not
fair,
perhaps
fairness
is
another...
another
element
of
this...
to
be
used
by
someone
who
unsuspectingly
is
led
to
believe
that
this
is
of
little
consequence.
later
on
it's
used
to
impose
imprisonment;
i
suggest
that's
inappropriate.
