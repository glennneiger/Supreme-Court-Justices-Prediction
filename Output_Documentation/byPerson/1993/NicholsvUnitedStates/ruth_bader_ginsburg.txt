mr.
carter,
do
i
understand
that
what
you're
saying
is
what
is
needed
here
is
something
comparable
to
a
rule
11
plea
that
this
is
a
piece
of
information
that
the
judge
should
have
told
the
defendant
the
possible
consequences?
so
just
as
the...
before
a
judge
takes
a
plea
in
an
ordinary
case,
he
has
to
spell
out
what
the
consequences
are,
and
the
defendant
says,
yes,
i
know,
i
know,
and
here
there
was
an
essential
piece
of
information
the
defendant
didn't
know.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
one
part
of
your
presentation
that
puzzled
me,
you
said
in
your
reply
brief
that
underlying
conduct
could
be
taken
into
account.
you
said
you're
not...
you
didn't
ask
the
court
below
and
you're
asking
this
court
to
immunize
him
from
consideration
of
his
prior
conduct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
conduct
that's
unrelated
to
the
present
offense
we're
talking
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
that
the
judge
could
have
considered
this
very
conduct,
the
dui
conduct,
could
consider
the
conduct
but
not
the
sentence,
is
that
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
insist
on
talking
in
terms
of
reliability
instead
of
in
terms
of
fair
notice
to
the
defendant
of
the
consequences
going
in.
why
do
you
take
that
line,
that
it's
a
question
of
reliability
and
not
of
fair
notice
to
the
defendant
of
the
consequences
of
his
plea?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
are...
are
they
not,
mr.
bryson,
all
conduct
relating
to
the
offense
before
the
court?
the
perjury,
the
related
conduct,
the
acquitted
conduct,
the
dismissed
charge,
all
have
to
do
in
relation
to
conduct...
in
relation
to
the
offense
of
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
there
a
difference
between
related
conduct...
conduct
related
to
the
offense
that
the
judge
must
take
into
account
and
that
can
throw
you
into
a
higher
range
and
any
kind
of
conduct
that
ever...
that
this
defendant
was
every
involved
in
that
is
part
of
the
defendant's
background?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but,
mr.
bryson,
what
about
the
fair
notice
consideration,
the
rule
11
question,
where
judges
are
cautioned
to
be
meticulous
when
they
take
a
plea
that
the
defendant
is
fully
informed
of
consequences
of
that
plea?
and
this
is
a
pretty
important
consequence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bryson,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
general...
the
run
of
the
mill
case
where
the
defendant
knows
when
he
takes
a
plea
that
he
is
subject
to
a
term
of
imprisonment.
but
this
is...
when
the
judge
takes
this
plea
without
counsel,
the
judge
has,
in
effect,
decided
that
there's
going
to
be
no
incarceration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
if
the
judge
thinks
incarceration
is
within
the
ballpark,
the
judge
has
to
afford
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
bryson,
in
your
hypothetical
it's
not
really
the
conviction...
it's
the
conduct
that
the
judge
would
be
taking
into
conduct,
because
the...
because
there's
no
instruction
to
the
judge
to
take
into
account
an
adverse
civil
judgment.
and
i
think
that
mr.
carter
conceded
that
the
judge
in
this
situation
could
take
into
account
the
conduct,
that
is
the
driving
under
the
influence,
but
could
not...
what
he
can't
do,
according
to
mr.
carter,
is
ratchet
it
up...
he
can't...
you
don't
get
into
a
new
guidelines
category,
but
the
conduct
can
be
considered
just
as
the
civil...
the
conduct
in
the
civil
case
could
be
considered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you're
making
an
analogy
to
civil
cases,
there
certainly
are
civil
judgments
that
are
good
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
another,
are
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
civil
judgments
that,
at
least
in
the
old
days,
constitutionally
were
good
for
only
one
case
only,
the
old
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
where
you
were
suing
the
property
and
not
the
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
good
judgment
for
that
case,
couldn't
be
used
in
any
other.
