justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
the
accused
was
advised
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
conviction
that
could
be
entered
if
he
proceeded
without
counsel
and
entered
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere,
was
that
the
sentence
could
late
be
escalated
based
on
a
previous
conviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
resolve
your
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
make
the
conviction
more
reliable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
mr.
bryson--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
risk
that
an
uncounseled
conviction
might
be
used
in
a
later
recidivist
proceeding
was
not
discussed
in
scott.
i
mean
if
this
is
such
a
well-understood
principle,
perhaps
then
we
should
have
discussed
that
as
one
of
the
risks
that
we
were
assessing
in
scott.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
familiar
to
us
that
we
missed
it
in
scott.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
do
you...
then
you
disagree
with
burgett
and
texas?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
we
could
use
that
same
reasoning
to
distinguish
your
boiler
room
civil
conviction
hypothetical
and
an
uncounseled
criminal
conviction.
we
could
say,
well,
it's
undercutting
gideon.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
that
we
don't
really
care
whether
it's
for
the
first
or
the
second
or
some
combination,
because
both
have
been
counseled
convictions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
you
can
argue
about
whether
or
not
you're
being
punished
for
some
combination
of
the
first
crime
and
the
second.
i
think
that's
open
to
argument
in
that
case
that
you
put.
