mr.
carter,
would
you
allow
the
judge
to
receive
evidence
of
the
uncounseled
conviction
as
proof
of
the
underlying
facts,
but
not
automatically
add
the
point
to
the
criminal
history
score?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is
that
the
conviction
does
not
automatically...
should
not
automatically
add
another
point
to
the
criminal
history
score.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
in
the
judge's
review,
to
the
extent
he
has
discretion
under
the
guidelines,
could
he
receive
the
conviction
in
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
understanding
what,
in
fact,
happened,
but
without
giving
it
the
automatic
triggering
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
he
would
decide
whether
or
not
to
increase
the
criminal
history
score.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
binding
precedent?
can't
be
overruled
even--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
are
never
totally
bound,
are
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
isn't
there
a
difference
between
using
a
factor
at
sentencing
when
the
judge
has
broad
discretion,
on
the
one
hand,
and
having
an
automatic
enhancement
by
adding
to
the
criminal
history
score
and
making
him...
perhaps
making
him
eligible
for
imprisonment
for
the
first
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
here
there's
a
difference
that
if
you
didn't
have
the
automatic
addition
of
the
point
and
the
judge
took
evidence
and
found
that
there
was
this
bad
conduct
committed
in
the
form
of
a
misdemeanor,
whether
a
valid
conviction
or
not,
he
would
have
discretion
as
to
whether
to
enhance
or
not,
but
under
the
guidelines
he
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
most
of
your
cases
where
you
talk
about
using
prior
history
have
been
in
the
discretionary
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
this
very
case,
for
example,
if
you
have
just
one
that
makes
all
the
difference
between
one
category
and
another,
would
the
judge
have
heard
evidence
if
he
wanted
to
get
on
the
stand
and
say
it
was
cheaper
to
plead
guilty
than
it
was
to
hire
a
lawyer
and
i
really
wasn't
drunk
that
night
when
i
was
driving,
but
i
decided
i'd
take
a
plea?
would
he
listen
to
that
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wouldn't...
in
this
very
case
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand.
but
we're
concerned
with
the
case
where
we
think
maybe
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
lawyer
might
have
made
a
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
if
we
rule
for
the
other
side,
the
government
could
nevertheless
put
in
the
conviction
as
evidence
supporting
some
additional
bad
characteristics
of
the
individual,
i
would
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
just
as
factors
to
be
considered
in
total
history.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
allowing
it
to
be
admitted
into
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
hadn't
thought
of
that
as
being
the
same.
you
may
be
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
can
i
ask
you
another
question?
i'm
just
curious
if
you
know
the
answer.
what
about
plea...
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere
supporting
a
conviction?
are
they
treated
the
same
as
a
guilty
plea
or
a
regular
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
kind
of
contrary
to
the
theory
of
nolo
contendere
plea.
but
that's
interesting,
i
didn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
now--
--do
the
guidelines
provide
for
enhancement
based
on
civil
judgments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
have
any
automatic
increase
in
points
where
you
go
from
one
bracket
to
another
based
on
civil--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
it's
always
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
