justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
you
those
purposes
for
which
you
agree
it
is
valid?
it's
valid
in
giving
the
individual
a
criminal
status
in
the
first
place;
you
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
just
criminal
status,
he's
got
a
record.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it's
valid
for
purposes
of
a
fine.
justice
david
h.
souter
a
substantial
one.
it's
valid,
i
assume,
a
conviction
like
this,
for
purposes
of
license
revocation
or
declarations
of
ineligibility
to
drive?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it
valid...
why
shouldn't
it
be
valid,
why
isn't
it
reliable
enough
to
be
used
to
identify
a
class
of
individuals
who
are
going
to
be
subject
to
a
heavier
penalty
in
the
future?
because
the
government's
argument
is
that
the
use...
that
the
direct
use
that's
being
made
of
the
conviction
is
simply
to
identify
the
class
which
is
subject
to
a
more
onerous
sentencing
scheme
for
later
offenses.
why
is
it
unreliable
for
that
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
where...
where...
where
does
the
relative
unreliability...
how
do
you
draw
the
line
on
relative
unreliability?
if
it's
reliable
enough
to
identify
him
as
a
criminal
with
certain
consequences
short
of
incarceration,
why
is
it
unreliable
enough
to
identify
him
as
a
member
of
a
class
which
is
on
notice
that
the
class
members
face
a
heavier
penalty
scheme
if
they
commit
further
offenses?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
your
answer...
would
your
answer
be
different
if
the
individual
had
an
opportunity
before
he
was
sentenced,
as
giving...
giving
weight
to
the
first
conviction,
to
prove
that,
in
fact,
he
didn't
do
what,
on
the
record,
he
appears
to
have
been
convicted
of?
would
your
answer
be
different
if
he
had
that
opportunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't...
doesn't
the
judge
have
that
discretion
under
the
guidelines,
because
he
can
depart
downward
if
the
criminal...
if
he
is
satisfied
that
the
criminal
history
does
not
give
an
adequate
or
accurate
indication
of
the...
of
the
individual's
past
culpability?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
could...
you
could
give
him
that
reason,
couldn't
you,
if
you
said,
look,
this
was
an
unreliable
conviction
because,
in
fact,
i
didn't
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'll...
i'll
bring
in
a
couple
of
witnesses
to
show
that
i
didn't.
now,
the
judge
has
the...
has
the
option
to
hear
that
evidence
and
to
consider
that
request,
doesn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the
judge...
the
judge
can
then...
if
the
judge
is
satisfied
that
the...
that
the
criminal
history
is
not
sufficient...
is
not
adequately
revealing
of
the
facts,
he
can
then
depart
downwards
so
that
a
person
in
your
client's
position
would
come
out
the
same
way
as
if
it
hadn't
been
considered
in
the
first
place.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
right.
and
if
there
is
an
adequate
justification,
the
judge
can
do
it.
if
there
isn't
an
adequate
justification,
there's
no
indication
that
the
original
sentence
is
or
the
original
conviction
is
unreliable.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you...
do
you
agree
with
me
that
there
is
an
opportunity
to
show
the
unreliability,
and
if
that
unreliability
is
shown
the
judge
has
an
opportunity
to
consider
that
in
a
downward
departure?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
it
enhance
reliability
as
opposed
simply
to
making
it
fair
to
stick
the
defendant
with
the
conviction?
what's
it
got
to
do
with
reliability?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
if...
you're
saying
that
the
waiver
of
counsel
makes
the
conviction
without
counsel
more
reliable,
and
my
question
is
why
does
it
make
it
more
reliable
as
opposed
merely
to
making
it
more
fair
to
charge
him
with
it,
reliable
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
only
difference--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but...
that
goes
to
waiver,
but
why
does
it
make
the
resulting
uncounseled
conviction
more
reliable
as
to...
i
assume
as
to
the
facts
which
it
imports?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you're
saying
it
could
not
be
a
valid
waiver
without
an
explanation
of
this
collateral
consequences--
justice
david
h.
souter
even
if
we
were
to
leave
that
aside,
was
i
correct
in
my
suggestion
to
opposing
counsel
that
the
judge
would
have
discretion,
in
effect,
to...
by
means
of
downward
departure
to
mitigate
this
automatic
character,
if
the
defendant
came
in
and
offered
evidence
to
the
effect
that
this
history
of
his
conviction
was
not
a
reliable
guide
to
what
he
had
actually
done,
because
for
whatever
reason
he
could
show
that
he
had
not
committed
the
offense.
the
judge
could
take
that
into
consideration
in
the
downward
departure,
couldn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
be
the
government's
position
that
that
would
be
improper,
that
the
court
should
not
entertain
a
request
to
present
evidence
for
that
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
there's
got
to
be
some
kind
of
a
high
initial
showing.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
offer
to
prove
something
extraordinary.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
is
it
your
position
that
it
would
not
only
be
improper
to
introduce
the
conviction,
but
that
it
would
be
improper
for
the
government
to
attempt
to
introduce
evidence
of
the
underlying
fact?
