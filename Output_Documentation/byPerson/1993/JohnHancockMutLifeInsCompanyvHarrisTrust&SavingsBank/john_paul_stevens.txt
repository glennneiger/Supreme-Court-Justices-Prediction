justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
the
free
funds
under
the
contract
could
just
be
returned
to
the
plan,
the
plan
trustee
use
it
as
he
would,
he
could
always
buy
a
guaranteed
contract,
couldn't
he,
if
you're
in
the
insurance
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
wouldn't
have
to
even
mention
the
possibility
of
doing
it,
as
long
as
the
plan
trustee
had
the
power
to
buy
insurance
from
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
option
would
always
be
there
because
you're
in
the
insurance
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
and
then
said
i'd
just
like
to
buy
your
policy.
and
you
fix
the
price,
as
i
understand
it.
he
doesn't...
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
one
thing
to
me
i
have
trouble
understanding?
what
is
the
status
of
the
paf
fund?
that's
not
a
segregated
fund,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
separately
accounted
for
on
the
company
books,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
can
be
ascertained
at
any
point
in
time,
what
the
paf
is
at
a
particular
point
in
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wait...
suppose--
--what
if
either
option
is
available?
that's
right.
suppose
the
plan
can
take
the
money
out
of
the...
out
of
the
free
funds
and
it's
its
option.
it
can
use
that
money
to
buy
fixed
or
contingent
benefits,
either
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kill--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
kill,
can
i
just
clear
up
on
factual.
now,
you
were
referring
to
the
period
after
1977.
what
about
the
period
between
1968
and
1977?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
'67...
after
the
'67.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
after
the
'68,
or
'67
amendment
effective
'68,
that
you
acquired
the
right
to
have
free
funds
generated
that
would
not
be
used
for
guaranteed
benefits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
during
the
period
between
'68
and
'77
they
were
within
the
safe
harbor
completely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
and
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
your
position
is
about
'68
to
'77.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
the...
try
to
get
the
question
a
little
different.
when,
in
your
view,
did
the
insurance
company
incur
an
obligation
to
have
separate...
separate
segregate
funds
for
your
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you
can
answer
my
question
with
a
date.
i'm
asking
you
when,
in
your
view,
they
had
an
obligation
to
create
separate
segregated
funds
for
your
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ever.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
fiduciary
can
commingle
the
funds
that
are
held
for
your
benefit
with
its
general
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
accounting
in
the
pa
fund
was
an
adequate
compliance
with
their--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
the
accounting
that
they
did
provide
in
the
pa
fund,
or
whatever
they
called
it,
was
an
adequate
compliance
with
their
fiduciary
obligations
to
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kill,
the
fact
that
the...
the
fact
the
guaranteed
points
aren't
settled
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
necessarily
answer
it.
supposing
you
had
a...
the
original
version
of
the
arrangement,
they
provided
nothing
but
guaranteed
policies
pursuant...
and
even
if
they
could
change
the
rates,
and
even
if
you
could
change
the
amount
you
purchased,
it
would
still
be
within
the
safe
harbor.
suppose
there
was
nothing
contemplated
other
than
guaranteed--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah,
but
i'm
saying
in
it's
original
form
could
not
the
price
change
and
the
amount
you
purchase
change?
justice
john
paul
stevens
forever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
who
changed
it
in
1973?
it's
up
to
them,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
price
goes
too
high,
you'll
just
buy
your
insurance
elsewhere.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
forget
the
free
funds
for
a
moment.
i'm
just
assuming
they
had
nothing
but
a
guaranteed...
guaranteed
contracts
covered...
as
they
did
originally.
you
could
vary
the
amount.
you
didn't
have
an
exclusive
requirement
that
you
buy
all
your
insurance
from
them,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
price...
both
the
price
and
the
quantity
covered
by
the
contract
were
variable
even
though
it
was
within
the
safe
harbor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
interest
rates
were
going
up.
i
assume
insurance
companies
made
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
saying
they're
not
entitled
to
make
a
profit?
