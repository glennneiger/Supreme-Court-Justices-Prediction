mr.
lawrence
kill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
case
of
an
insurance
carrier,
the
statute
tells
us
exactly
what
is
covered
and
what
is
not
covered.
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
define
plan
assets
except
in
the
case
of
an
insurance
carrier.
and
in
the
case
of
an
insurance
carrier,
the
definition
of
plan
assets
is
anything
other
than
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy.
we
all
agree
that
guaranteed
benefits
are
exempt.
our
position
is
that
variable
benefits
or
variable
payments
to
a
plan
are
plan
assets
and
subject
to
erisa's
fiduciary
duty
rules.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
an
effort
by
congress
to
make
certain
that
the
traditional
or
standard
annuity...
where
pension
funds
are
given
to
a
carrier
in
exchange
for
a
promise
to
pay
specified
benefits
at
a
specific
time
in
the
future.
congress
was
exempting
the
traditional
standard
annuity.
in
peoria,
jude
posner
makes
that
analysis
and
i
think
it
follows
from
a
reading
of
the
statute.
guaranteed
benefits
are
exempt;
everything
else
is
within
the
four
corners
of
the
statute.
the
definition
of
fiduciary
is
functional,
and
you
look
at
a
person's
activities.
the
activities
here
by
hancock
are
specified
in
a
contract
which
is
labeled
guaranteed
benefits,
nonguaranteed
benefits.
two
different
distinct
promises
are
made
and
were
made
in
1977.
the
payment
of
guaranteed
benefits
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
the
payment
of
nonguarantees
has
everything
to
do
with
this
case.
it
was
understood
that
hand
could...
hancock
would
invest
pension
funds
in
order
to...
in
order
to
create
money
for
the
payment
of
nonguaranteed
benefits,
if
sought
by
the
plan.
in
this
case
the
plan
demanded
that
hancock
use
the
excess
funds
for
the
payment
of
nonguaranteed
benefits
and
hancock
said
no.
in
1982
they
turned
off
the
spigot
and
said
we
can't
use
it.
can
we
have
it
back?
no.
what
can
we
do
with
it?
nothing.
until
1988
when
the
nonguaranteed
portion
had
risen
from
$18
million
to
in
excess
of
$55
million,
the
plan
was
frustrated
in
its
ability
to
use
those
excess
funds.
in
1988,
hancock
finally
agreed
to
a
plan
amendment
which
allowed
us
to
withdraw
almost
$55
million
of
free
funds...
a
term
coined
by
hancock,
not
the
trust.
under
that
amendment
we
could
withdraw
it
without
suffering
the
penalty
of
contract
termination
and
the
repurchase
of
annuities
and,
in
effect,
convert
the
contract
into
a
deferred
annuity
contract.
now,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
$55
million,
when
in
the
possession
of
hancock,
was
not
free
funds
but
the
moment
it
was
transferred
it
became
free
funds.
now,
hancock's
position
in
this
case
is
a
resurrection
of
the
senate
bill,
plain,
simple
resurrection
of
the
senate
bill.
the
dol
recognizes
that
that
does
not
make
any
sense
and
congress
must
have
something
else
in
mind.
and
as
a
guess,
and
they
say
it's
a
guess,
they
sought
to
close
a
large
loophole.
that
is
the
sale
of
variable
annuities
out
of
the
general
account.
mr.
lawrence
kill
cref
is
not
even
an
insurance
carrier.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
or
otherwise
that
congress
was
even
aware
of
that
particular
problem.
mr.
lawrence
kill
in
1978
after
the
enactment
of
erisa.
and
they
issued
an
advisory
opinion
which
in...
which
is
very
supportive
of
the
position
that
we
take
before
this
court.
to
the
extent
that
the
insurance
carrier
invests
funds
which
create
a
variable
return
which
can
be
used
by
the
plan
for
nonguaranteed
benefits,
it
is
a
plan
asset
and
hancock
is
subject
to
the
fiduciary
rules.
mr.
lawrence
kill
in
addition,
except
for
that
one
example
at
the
birth
of
erisa
and
today
it's
illegal
in
all
50
states
to
sell
variable
annuities
out
of
general
accounts.
so
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
kill
the
period
between
'68
and
1977,
the
only
contractual
arrangement
was
for
the
payment
of
nonguaranteed
benefits...
excuse
me,
payment
of
guaranteed
benefits.
and--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--after
'68,
although
the
conversion
from
a
deferred
annuity
into
a...
what
they
call
an
ipg
contract
changed
the
relationship
of
the
parties
in
that
it
became
an
investment
contract
and
really
not
an
insurance
contract.
mr.
lawrence
kill
between
'68
and
'6...
and
'77,
when
an
employee
retired
he
was
entitled
automatically
to
guaranteed
benefits.
the
purpose
of
the
'77
amendment
was
twofold,
to
sort
of
freeze
the
population...
not
require
the
fund
to
request
any
further
guarantees
at
all.
and
since
1977
the
fund
has
not
requested
any
further
guarantees.
mr.
lawrence
kill
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
agree.
i
think
it's
clear
in
light
of
the
'77
amendment.
the
reason
for
the
'77
amendment
was
the
results--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--the
results
during
the
period
'68
to
'77
was
creating
on
an
annual
basis
what
hancock
call
free
funds
and
we
call
admitted
excess.
an
amount
over
and
above
the
amount
they
need,
using
the
contract
assumptions,
to
guarantee
the
benefits.
these
free
funds
were
sitting
there
and
were
not
available
for
any
purpose.
during
'68
through
'77
at
times
hancock
allowed
a
rollover
or
a
roll
out
in
1977,
for
example,
of
some
of
the
free
funds
to
prevent
the
excess
funds
from
increasing.
but
the
problem
had
reached
the
point
of
the
continued
growth
of
free
funds
that
hancock
in
1977
agreed
that
the
free
funds
now
can
be
used
to
pay
nonguaranteed
benefits
because
the
trustee
was
very
unhappy,
as
a
fiduciary,
seeing
pension
funds
in
the
possession
of
hancock
which
cannot
be
used
for
benefit
enhancements.
mr.
lawrence
kill
well,
one,
i
think...
and
that
gets
to
the...
sort
of
the
havoc
that
was
mentioned.
we
don't
agree
with
that
at
all.
what
we
have
is
a
general
account.
we
already
have
segmentation.
we
already
have,
and
they've
had
since
1982,
separate
lines
of
business
where
they
do
segregate.
mr.
lawrence
kill
well,
i
do
not
think
they
have
an
obligation
to
create
segregated
funds.
mr.
lawrence
kill
that's
my
difficulty.
they
have
an
obligate...
have
a
general
account,
we
agree.
general
account
stands
for--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--yes,
as
long
as
they
segment.
and
segmentation
is
a
tool
that
the
insurance
companies
use
for
asset
allocation.
they
actually...
they
actually
allocate
assets
to
different
segments.
they
have
a
pension
segment,
they
have
a
life
segment,
they
have
a
casualty
segment.
each
has
different
investment
policies.
it's
still
commingled,
but
they
tag
assets.
mr.
lawrence
kill
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
lawrence
kill
i
think
with
seg...
not
the
mere
accounting
function.
i
think
with
segmentation
where
they
allocate
specific
assets
and
so
the
standard
of
investment
is
consistent
with
erisa's
prudent
man
rule,
then
i
think,
yes,
they
would
be
in
compliance
with
erisa
and
their
obligations
to
the
trustee.
it
is
not
the
fact
of
the
general
account
that
creates
any
problem.
the--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--it
is
because
they
have
different
lines
of
business.
mr.
lawrence
kill
it's
a
form
of
segregation,
it's
a
form
of
segmentation.
mr.
lawrence
kill
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
do
through
segmentation.
mr.
lawrence
kill
contract
by
contract
and
line
of
business
by
line
of
business,
assets
are
allocated.
and
the
standards
applied
by
hancock
with
respect
to
the
pension
lines
of
business,
which
could
be
the
erisa
lines
of
business,
are
consistent
with
the
higher
standards
that
erisa
demands
to
act
solely
in
the
interest
of
the
plan.
mr.
lawrence
kill
they're
tagged,
identified.
mr.
lawrence
kill
it
may
be,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
kill
it
would
be...
it
would
be
up
to
hancock,
as
a
fiduciary,
to
establish
standards
which
comply
with
erisa's
prudent
man
rule.
erisa's
does
not
require
that
you
invest
in
a
or
b.
mr.
lawrence
kill
they're...
they
are
segmented,
that
is
our
understanding.
it's
in
the
undisputed
facts
in
this
case
that
hancock,
since
at
least
1982,
has
had
a
policy
of
segmentation.
mr.
lawrence
kill
segmenting
means
identifying
particular
assets.
mr.
lawrence
kill
like
a
building.
mr.
lawrence
kill
and
the
income
generated
and
expenses
attributable
to
that
asset
are
allocated
to
that
line
of
business.
mr.
lawrence
kill
to
our
fund.
mr.
lawrence
kill
eventually
to
our
fund.
mr.
lawrence
kill
not...
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
kill
no.
mr.
lawrence
kill
first
to
the
pension
line
of
the
business
and
then
through
hancock's
investment
generation
method,
which
looks
at
the
year
in
which
contributions
were
made,
it
eventually
is
allocated
to
the
particular
contract.
mr.
lawrence
kill
a
real
estate
investment
of
any
magnitude
may
very
well
be
permissible
with
respect
to
one
line
of
business--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--my
understanding
is...
and
i
don't...
do
not
know
the
specific
investments,
is
that
hancock
has
separate
investment
standards
and
policies.
with
respect
to
the
pension
line
of
business
it
will
engage
in
certain
investments
which
are
consistent
with
the
necessity
to
provide
security
because
we
are
dealing
with
pension
funds.
but
i
cannot
tell
you
the
specific
assets
involved.
mr.
lawrence
kill
well,
the
department
of
labor,
in
interpreting
erisa,
has
authorized
and
approved
pooled
separate
accounts,
which
is
commingling
the
funds
allocable
to
many
many
different
plans.
the
department
of
labor
has
even
authorized
banks
under...
banks
to
commingle
pension
funds
and
nonpension
funds.
they...
the
fiduciary
is
still
obligated
to
maintain
the
standards
of
erisa.
and
the
language
of--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--well,
i
think
the...
the
department
of
labor,
through
its
regulatory
process,
oversees
exactly
what
fiduciaries
are
doing.
they
must
make
annual
reports.
pursuant
to
5500,
the
department
of
labor
requires
annual
reports
which
identify
the
investments
that
are
made.
it
is
a
system
under
which
the
fiduciary
has
the
obligation
and
the
department
of
labor
does
not
sit
there
day
in,
day
out,
and
determine
what
investments
are
appropriate.
now,
if
i
may,
the
issue
of
the
statute,
because
i
think
while
there
are
certain
problems
that
may
result
in
the
event
that
the
court
decides
that
assets
in
the
general
account...
because
they're
used
to
create
additional
funds
for
the
payment
of
nonguaranteed
benefits
or
plan
assets,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute.
the
phrase
"to
the
extent"
is
a
phrase
of
limitation.
the
phrase
"to
the
extent"
is
not
only
used
in
the
statute
regarding
guaranteed
benefit
policies,
but
is
used
with
respect
to
fiduciaries.
you
can
be
a
fiduciary
to
the
extent
you
provide
certain
activities
and
you
can
be
a
nonfiduciary
with
respect
to
other
activities
regarding
the
same
assets.
if
it's
used
in
the
statute,
it
ought
to
be
given
the
same
meaning.
to--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--provides
for
benefits.
it
doesn't
say
"provide
for
the
purchase
of
benefits.
"
"provide
for
the
purchase
in
the
future
of
benefits.
"
the--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--the
argument
"provide
for",
first
of
all,
was
not
even
raised
in
the
second
circuit
by
john
hancock.
but--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--i
understand.
it
was
raised
first
in
the
third
circuit
by
mack
boring.
now,
mack
boring
decided
that
variable
annuities
payable
to
a
plan
do
not
trigger
erisa's
fiduciary
responsibilities
as
long
as
any
benefits...
and
it
substituted
for
the
words
"to
the
extent"
the
word
"if".
if
any
benefits
are
guaranteed,
no
matter
how
minuscule,
the
entirety
of
the
contract
is
immune.
it
ignored
the
words
"to
the
extent".
well,
the
words
erisa.
and
the
conference
report
does
not
speak
just
solely
in
terms
of
benefits.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
payments,
payments
to
plans.
now,
here
we
have
a
defined
benefit
plan,
but
the
money
to
pay
the
defined
benefits
comes
from
investment
managers
such
as
john
hancock.
that's
what
they
were
hired
for,
and
they
would
provide
the
funds
from
which
the
benefits
may
be
enhanced.
let
me
answer
the
sec
v.
united
benefit,
where
we
had
a
similar
annuity
option
purchase
facility.
and
justice
harlan
stated...
in
trying
to
determine
the
investment
and
insurance
components
of
a
single
contract,
he
said
you
look
at
the
features.
even
with
that
facility,
until
there's
a
purchase
of
annuities
it
remains
an
investment
contract
subject
to
the
securities
laws.
mr.
lawrence
kill
the
"provide
for"
language
is
used
by
john
hancock
and
the
department
of
labor
to
argue
that
as
long
as
we
have
the
option
to
buy.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
even
if
we
had
the
option,
it's
still
not
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy
until
we
exercise
the
option.
we
shouldn't
be
a
captive
and
be
required
to
exercise
the
option.
moreover,
the
amount
available
for
benefits,
these
nonguaranteed
benefits,
as
to
which
we
can
exercise
the
option
in
the
future
depends
solely
and
entirely
on
the
investment
experience
of
this
contract.
the
risk
is
solely
borne
by
the
policyholder.
mr.
lawrence
kill
hancock
does
not
have
any
risk.
mr.
lawrence
kill
it...
"provides
for
benefits"
means
the
standard
annuity.
you
provide
now,
in
the
present
tense,
for
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
kill
the
contract
with
the
carrier
provides
for
a
guarantee
of
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
kill
it
does
not
provide
for
benefits.
it
doesn't
directly
provide
for
benefits.
hancock
is
a
guarantor.
they
said
defined
benefit
plan
and
hancock,
in
effect,
guarantees
the
benefits.
it
does
pay
the
benefits
because
the
plan,
under
the
contract,
has
the
right
to
ask
hancock
to
pay
the
benefits.
so
hancock
does
pay
the
benefits.
now,
the
"provide
for",
if
i
may,
it
doesn't
say
provide
for
the
purchase
or
provide
in
the
future.
and
even
if
this
is
an...
even
if
this
is
an
option
available,
there's
no
price.
there's
an
illusory
promise.
what
price?
hancock
can
unilaterally
set
the
price.
this
statute
cannot
mean
that
you
would
immunize
the
entirety
of
a
contract
which
can't...
contains
no
guaranteed
benefits
and
just
an
option,
an
annuity
option,
without
more...
without
price.
the
price
can
be
unilaterally
set
by
hancock
in
the
future
at
any
time.
so
what
we
have
here
is
the
amount
is
uncertain
and
the
price
is
uncertain.
and
moreover,
as
a
fiduciary,
hancock
should
not
be
in
the
position
of
compelling
us
to
use
nonguaranteed
benefits
to
purchase
nonguaranteed...
funds
available
for
nonguaranteed
benefits
to
purchase
guaranteed--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--well,
that's
the
original.
that
isn't
part
of
it.
because
the
reason
for
the
enactment
of
erisa--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--in
the
original
form
there
were
prices
set
in
the
contract.
mr.
lawrence
kill
not
forever.
until
1973
it
was
the
fixed
price.
mr.
lawrence
kill
hancock...
hancock
has
the
right
after
1973.
mr.
lawrence
kill
we
can't
because
we
can't
use
the
free
funds
to
buy
insurance
elsewhere.
mr.
lawrence
kill
absolutely
not.
we
did
not.
mr.
lawrence
kill
no
what
the...
the
difference
is
in
that
in
1974
congress
decided
to
enact
erisa
to
assist
trustees
such
as
this
one
from
the
abuses
of
an
insurance
carrier
maintaining
funds
for
its
own
purposes
far
in
excess
of
the
amount
necessary
for
those
guaranteed
benefits.
now,
prior
to
'77,
there
were
excess
funds
and...
but
when
an
employee
retired,
yes,
the
guarantees
were
automatically...
they...
automatically
guaranteed.
but
the
excess
funds
were
growing.
mr.
lawrence
kill
and
we
couldn't
use
the
excess
funds.
mr.
lawrence
kill
they
are
entitled.
this
is...
this
is
not
hancock's
profit.
we
have
a
contract
and
it's
allocated
to
a
pension
administration
fund
and
they
have
a
liability
that
matches
the
amount
of
assets
they
hold.
the
only
difference
is
that
we
cannot
use
the
amount
that's
in
excess
of
the
amount
necessary,
computed
by
hancock,
for
nonguaranteed
benefits.
we
couldn't
use
it
between
'68
and
'77,
but
because
of
erisa...
and
the
terminology
is
the
same.
in
the
1977
amendment
it
speaks
of
guaranteed
benefits
and
it
speaks
of
nonguaranteed
benefits
and
it
says...
it
uses
the
phrase
in
the
contract,
"to
the
extent
that
hancock
guarantees
benefits,
it
has
responsibility.
"
"otherwise,
the
risk
is
solely
that
of
the
policyholder.
"
and
that
is...
that
is
the
essence
of
the...
our
understanding
of
the
cases
that
have
considered
erisa.
it's
who
bears
the
risk.
until
there
is
a
purchase,
the
risk
is
entirely,
100
percent,
on
the
plan.
if
the
amount
of
money
is
not
sufficient
to
pay
the
nonguaranteed
benefit
when
a
person
retires,
hancock
doesn't
bear
the
risk.
we
must
make
a
contribution
or
the
contract
would
be
terminated.
so
the
risk,
until
there
is
an
acquisition
of
a
guaranteed
benefit,
is
entirely
on
the
plan.
once
hancock
assumes
the
risk,
that
is
the
money,
that
is
the
funds
that
are
outside
the
purview
of
erisa.
now,
the
statute
also
uses
the
word
"benefits"
and
there's
been
a
lot
of
stress,
but
doesn't
that
mean
that
anything
else...
can
we
ignore
variable
payments
to
the
plan?
this
court
has
held
that
the
protection
of
the
plan
is
equally
important.
not
only
the
protection
of
participants
and
beneficiaries,
they
are
protected
through
the
plan.
the
conference
committee
uses
the
word
"payments
to
a
plan".
those
are
the
funds,
the
money
that
becomes
eventually
the
benefits
that
are
paid
to
the
participants
and
beneficiaries.
if
hancock's
interpretation
is
accepted,
that
if
the
benefit...
if
they
guarantee
a
single
benefit
in
a
contract,
that
the
entirety
of
the
contract
is
immune,
that
means
every
defined
benefit
plan
in
the
united
states
funded
in
part
by
insurance
companies
is
outside
the
protections
of
erisa.
and
that,
i
submit,
is
a
more
unconscionable
result
than
the
parade
of
horribles
that
has
been
used
and
grossly
exaggerated
before
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
kill
if
that
is
so,
we
would
lose
because
mr.
kristol's
interpretation
is
the
enactment
of
a
senate
bill
immunizing
general
accounts
as
a
category.
mr.
lawrence
kill
well,
you
know,
there
are
at
least
four
reasons
why
this
court
should
not
grant
deference
to
the
department
of
labor.
one,
it's
fundamentally
in
conflict
with
the
statute.
the
department
admits
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
grant
an
exemption
from
erisa's
fiduciary
responsibility
rules.
mr.
lawrence
kill
yes,
your...
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
i
think
the
statute,
on
its
face,
has
been
twisted
all
out
of
context.
all
it...
all
it
says
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy
is
a
policy
to
the
extent
it
provides
for
benefits,
the
amount
of
which
is
guaranteed.
mr.
lawrence
kill
exactly,
your
honor.
that
is...
that
is
the
exact
point.
if
i
could
only
add,
because
a
question
arose--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--well,
the
third
circuit,
i
think,
interpreted
the
phrase
erisa,
and
then
stated
that
"provide
for"
means
as
long
as
you
have
some
right
at
any
time
in
the
future,
that's
sufficient
for
the
court
to
determine
that
this
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy.
but
if
i
may
finish
the
answer,
because
75-2,
upon
which
the
department
seeks
deference
through
today,
so-called
settled
expectations,
is
not
factual.
first
of
all,
they
issued
advisory
opinions
that
are
fundamentally
in
conflict
with
interpretive
bulletin
75-2.
they
told
the
second
circuit
they
did
not
have
a
position;
that
it
was
very
important,
very
complex.
they've
even
told
the
court
that
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
has
some
merit
and
that
it
concededly
has
advantages.
mr.
lawrence
kill
and
they
said
that
it
concede...
that
our
interpretation
has
some
merit.
and
all
i'm
suggesting,
that
that
if
that
is
the
case
and
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
i
would
imagine
that
the
trustee
representing
the
pension
plan
should
prevail
because
the
purpose
of
erisa--
mr.
lawrence
kill
--well,
i
think
general
deference
is
part
of
our
jurisprudence.
but
you
look
at
the
thoroughness,
the
reasoning,
the
consistency,
and
the
persuasiveness.
in
light
of
the
history,
i
think
that
the
dol
has
not
established
any
of
these
elements.
they...
as
late
as
last
year
telling
the
second
circuit
they
did
not
have
a
position.
and
what
is
the
position
today?
the
position
today
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
ib
75-2,
upon
which
they
rely.
they
said...
ib
75-2
was
intended
to
give
a
blanket
exemption,
like
the
senate
bill,
to
insurance
companies.
today
they
stand
up
and
say
no,
this
was
intended
to
cover
variable
annuities
sold
out
of
general
accounts,
even
though
that's
illegal
in
all
50
states.
but
those
are
two
inconsistent
positions.
the
dol
has
not
made
a
consistent
position.
they
have,
in
fact,
supported
the
trustee
on
numerous
occasions
in
advisory
opinions
and
in
other
ways.
and
if
you
read
their
brief,
except
for
the
bottom
line
they're
very
supportive
of
harris
trust.
they
point
out
that
our
position
has
merit,
that
it
would
protect
pensioners,
it
would
protect
plans
against...
it
said
added
significant...
significant
is
their
word...
legal
protections
to
protect
plans
against
losses.
that
is
what
erisa
is
all
about.
so
the
history
of
the
department's
interpretation
of
this
statute
has
been
ambiguous,
not
the
statute.
and
i
dare
say
today
their
interpretation
is
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
