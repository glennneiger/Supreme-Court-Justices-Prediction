mr.
kristol,
there's
reference
in
the
briefs
to
the
period
between
'77
and
'82
and
what
is
the
nature
of
the
benefits
paid
between
those
years?
were
they,
in
fact,
nonguaranteed,
or
were
they
fixed?
what
were
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
question
in
your
mind
about
that.
justice
harry

blackmun
but
there's
also
comment
to
the
effect
that
the
decision
below
would
wreak
havoc.
the
seventh
circuit
adopted
the
second
circuit's
rule
a
decade
ago.
is
there
anything
that
that
case
has
wreaked
havoc
on
the
insurance
industry
in
the
midwest?
