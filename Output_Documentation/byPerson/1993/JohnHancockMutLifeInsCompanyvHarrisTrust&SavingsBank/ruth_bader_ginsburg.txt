justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
any
followup
to
that
peoria
case?
it
was...
the
12(3)(6)
was
overturned
and
when
it
went
back
to
the
district
court,
is
there
any
followup?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
this
statute
that
congress
passed,
that
the
meaning
of
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
if
the
senate
bill,
which
was
very
clear,
had
passed,
that
there's
practically
no
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
a
hypothetical
that
state
law
prevents
from
being
a
reality.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kristol
said
more
than
that.
he
said
it
can't
exist
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
it's
prohibited
in
all
50
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
say
they
have
the
example
of
cref
having
such
a
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
say
that
cref
came
to
them
with
a
request
for...
to...
a
ruling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kristol,
i
think,
had
to
say
that
congress
really
didn't
do
anything
different
from
what
was
in
the
senate
bill.
and
if
that's
so,
you
lose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
he
says.
they
made
some
changes
and
the
department
of
labor
has
told
us
that
that
change
took
care
of
a
case
which,
in
reality,
is
not
likely
to
occur.
but
if
what
congress
did
do...
we
have
a
clear
senate
position.
everyone
agrees
the
senate
was
clear,
general
account
is
out.
and
then
congress
did
something
and
no
one
is
actually...
is
entirely
clear
what
congress
did.
and
then
we're
left
with
the
department
of
labor's
at
least
current
interpretation
is
clear,
whatever
wavering
there
may
have
been.
isn't
the
court
bound
to
respect
the
department's
construction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
claiming
that
the
statute
has
a
plain
meaning,
are
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
it
would
be
you
taking
on
both
the
panel
of
the
third
circuit
that
didn't
agree
that
the
statute
had
that
plain
meaning,
and
the
department
of
labor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah,
but
their
point
was...
their
point
was
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
exactly
when
we
defer
to
agencies,
when
a
statute
has
more
than
one
plausible
meaning.
i
think,
and
justice
stevens
told
us,
that
we
are
to
defer
to
the
agency's
position
as
long
as
is
it
is
a
plausible
reason...
reading
even
if
not
the
most
plausible.
