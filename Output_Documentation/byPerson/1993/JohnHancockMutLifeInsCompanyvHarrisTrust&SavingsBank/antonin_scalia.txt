justice
antonin
scalia
or...
well,
that's
not
quite
accurate.
isn't...
what
you
could
say
with
entire
accuracy
is
to
the
extent
the
contract
provides
for
benefits,
it
provides
for
guaranteed
benefits.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
is
in
the
free
fund
may
not
ultimately
be
used
to
provide
benefits
at
all,
right?
it's
up
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
it
is
not...
it
is
clearly
not
providing
guaranteed
benefits.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
it's
not
providing
guaranteed
benefits
it's
providing
no
benefits
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
guaranteed
benefits?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kristol,
could
i
followup
on
the
various
hypotheticals
that
you...
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
there
were
guaranteed
benefits
and
the
free
funds
were
to
be
used
exclusively
to
provide
contingent
benefits...
that
is
benefits
the
amount
of
which
or
even
the
existence
of
which
would
depend
upon
whether
the
free
funds
were
available
or
not,
you
would
still
call
that
a
guaranteed
benefit
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
take
my
hypothetical.
there
are
guaranteed
benefits
which
the
insurer...
the
insurer
guarantees,
fixed
amount
of
benefits.
in
addition,
however,
if
the
plan
generates
more
money,
that
is
if
the
free
funds
are
available
for
the
purpose
after
paying
off
the
guaranteed
benefits,
there
will
be
additional
benefits
paid,
but
those
benefits
are
contingent
upon
the
free
funds
being
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know,
i
just
made
it
up.
i
just
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
you
think
that
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
plan
or
not?
as
i
understand
your
theory,
it
is.
you're
saying
so
long
as
some
benefits
are
guaranteed,
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
rest
of
the
money
is
being
used
for,
even
if
they're
being
used
for
contingent
benefits.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
how...
that's
where
you
left
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wasn't
my
hypothetical.
please
take
my
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
the
plan
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
will
be
these
benefits
and
they
pay
the
insurance
company
and
the
insurance
company
says,
yes,
for
this
amount
of
money
we
will
provide
those
fixed
benefits.
in
addition,
if
there's...
you
know,
if
our
investments
turn
out
to
be
very
good
and
there's...
and
there
are
sufficient
funds
in
the
free
fund
to
cover
it,
we
will
pay
additional
benefits.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wright,
you
said...
as
i
heard
you
say
it,
you
said
that
it
does
not
constitute
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy
if
the
free
funds
could
be
used
to
purchase
variable
annuities.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
don't
think
that's...
that
is
not
what
mr.
kristol
said,
as
i
understood
what
he
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
want
to
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
your
test,
that
would
not
be
a
guaranteed
benefit
plan,
but
mr.
kristol
thinks
it
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
statute
says
nonguaranteed.
it
doesn't
say
nonvariable,
it
says
nonguaranteed.
it's
enough
that
they're
not
guaranteed.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
guaranteed
benefits
may
be
made
but
need
not
be
made,
it
has
provided
for
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
whole
fund
is
provided
for
so
long
as
guaranteed
payments
may
be
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
that
serve
the
purpose
that
you're
concerned
about,
which
is
not
to
let
the
insurer
play
with
the...
play
with
the
assets
of
the
pensioners?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
were
going
to
do
that,
they'd
do
it
in
a
conference
report,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
were
going
to
do
something
so
unusual,
they
would
do
it
in
a
conference
committee,
wouldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it's
not
enough.
it's
not
enough.
you
say
they
have
different
lines
of
business.
erisa
doesn't
guarantee
that
you
treat
this
line
of
business
separately.
it
says
that
the
fiduciary
shall
discharge
the
following
duties
with
respect
to
a
plan
solely
in
the
interest
of
the
participants
and
beneficiaries.
that
means
that
he
would
have...
the
insurance
company
would
have
to
identify
funds
that
are
solely
in
the
interest
not
of
this
whole
line
of
all
insureds
from
all
companies
who
have
contingent
benefits,
but
in...
your
contingent
beneficiaries
they
would
have
had
to
guarantee.
justice
antonin
scalia
fund
by
fund
or
line
of
business
by
line
of
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
your
fund?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
particular
fund.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
eventually.
immediately
allocated
to
your
fund.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
different
funds
may
have
different
needs.
for
example,
the
employees
in
your
fund
may
all...
you
say
they
haven't
had
annuants
for
a
while.
they
may
all
be
approaching
the
age...
well,
you'll
only
need
the
money
for
another
10
years
so
it
would
pay
to
liquidate
this
piece
of
real
estate
if
this
were
the
only
fund
you're
talking
about.
whereas
if
you
have
a
general
allocation
of
this
real
estate
to
simply
contingent
funds,
not
just
your
fund
but
a
lot
of
other
ones,
it
might
pay
to
retain
the
real
estate.
now
as
i
read
erisa,
that
real
estate
has
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
interest
of
your
fund's
beneficiaries,
not
funds
in
general
but
your
fund's
beneficiaries.
justice
antonin
scalia
without
examining
the
funds
at
all.
just
these
are
pension
funds
without
examining
whether
the
funds
have
exactly
the
same
kind
of
beneficiaries
and
exactly
the
same
kind
of
needs?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kill--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
it
would
be...
would
have
been
quite
impossible
for
this
text
to
have
read
"provides
benefits"
rather
that
"provides
for
benefits",
because
the
contract
never
provides
benefits.
the
policy
never
provides
benefits.
it
would
have
to
read
"the
policy
or
contract
provides
for
benefits.
"
i
don't
really
see
that
the
word
"for"
gets
you
a
whole...
a
whole
distance
along
the
line.
the
only
logical
way
to
say
it
is
"provides
for
benefits".
justice
antonin
scalia
the
contract
never
provides
benefits,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
it
does
not
provide
benefits.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
to
the
extent
that
plainly
doesn't
mean
"if".
