justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
how
would
the
statute
be
construed
in
the
instance
that
you
put
where
with
free
funds
the
insurer
may
purchase
guaranteed
benefits
or
variable
benefits?
what
result
under
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
exemption
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
insurer
have
the
benefit
of
the
(2)(b)
exemption
in
the
case
that
i
put?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
as
long
as
one
of
the
options
is
to
purchase
guaranteed
benefits,
that
gives
the
company
the
safe
harbor
that
it
seeks
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
all
an
insurance
company
needs
to
do
to
get
the
safe
harbor,
if
we
can
call
it
that,
is
to
just
include
guaranteed
benefits
as
one
of
the
options
and
it's
home
free.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
how
do
you
treat
the
phrase
"to
the
extent"?
do
you
just
ignore
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
right,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
i
take
it
the
fund
always
has
to
exist
before
the
option
can
be
exercised.
you
have
to
characterize
the
status
of
the
free
fund
the
moment
it's
created.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
say
that--
--and
what
justice
souter's
asking,
in
effect,
is
we
should
have
a
test
to
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
simply
based
on
the
options
available
to
the
parties,
what
the
status
of
this
fund
is.
