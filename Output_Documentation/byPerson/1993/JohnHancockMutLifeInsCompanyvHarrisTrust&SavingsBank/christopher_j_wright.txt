mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
many
questions
have
been
raised.
if
i
can
respond
first
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
whether
our
position
would
be
any
different
if
the
senate
bill
had
been
passed.
i
think
it
came
out
that
our
position
would
be
different.
the
senate
bill
very
clearly
provided
that
general
account
assets
are
not
plan
assets.
the
conference
committee
rewrote
the
provision
in
its
present
form,
and
we
believe
that
it
made
the
following
modest
change.
it
provided
that
to
the
extent
that
a
general
account
plan
could
be
used
to
provide
variable
benefits,
something
that
is...
that
was
and
is
highly
unusual,
that
to
that
extent
it
would
not
be
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
there's
one
important
exception
which
is
illustrated
in
the
1978
advisory
opinion
that
we've
referenced,
that's
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
in
new
york.
since
1952
it
has
provided
variable
annuities
out
of
a
general
account,
and
in
1978
it
went
to
the
department
of
labor
for
confirmation
that
it
was
not
a
fiduciary.
because
the
department
had
earlier
said,
somewhat
echoing
the
language
of
the
senate
bill,
that
general
account
assets
are
not
plan
assets.
when
the
department
in
1978
was
faced
with
the
example
of
cref,
the
college
retirement
equities
fund,
and
realized
that
there
was
this
exception
under
which
variable
annuities
could
be
paid
from
general
account
contracts,
it
then
recognized
that,
no,
cref
was
a
fiduciary
in
that
circumstance.
and
if
i
could
take
1
minute
to
explain
why...
why
that
labor
thought
that
that
was
an
important
distinction
and
why
congress
might
well
have
thought
that
was
an
important
distinction,
i'd
really
like
to
explain
that.
if
variable
annuities
are
paid,
then
the
amount
that
pensioners
receive
depends
on
how
the
general
account
is
performing.
it
seems
clear
that
congress
would
want
an
insurance
company
to
be
a
fiduciary
in
that
circumstance.
it's
different
with
gen...
with
group
annuity
contracts
paying
fixed
benefits
like
those
here.
the
pensioners
have
been
promised
fixed
benefits.
in
the
case
of
those
pensioners
whose
benefits
have
already
been
guaranteed,
they
will
receive
monthly
payments
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
from
john
hancock,
no
matter
how
long
they
live
and
no
matter
how
the
general
account
performs.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
let
me
phrase
it
another
way.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
think
we're
in
agreement
here,
but
our--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--our
agreements
are
greater
here,
certainly.
our
position
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
funds
are
available
to
provide
fixed
benefits,
it's
a
guaranteed
annuity
policy.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
to
the
extent
that
they're
available
to
provide
variable
benefits,
they're
not.
and
if
i
could
continue...
if
i
could--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
think
there
are
actually
two
very--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
think
there
are
actually
two
different
very
good
hypotheticals
here,
and
let
me
explain
that
both
of
them
are
different
than
what's
going
on
in
this
case.
hypothetical
one,
the
money,
some
of
it
is...
and
let
me
say
that
both
of
these
are
hypotheticals.
there
is
no
state
law
that
i
know
of
that
would
allow
either
of
these.
hypothetical
one,
the
money
is
used
to
some
extent
to
provide
fixed
benefits
and
to
some
extent
to
provide
variable
benefits.
we
would
say
that
to
the
extent
that
fixed
benefits
are
provided,
it's
a
guaranteed
annuity
plan.
to
the
extent
variable
benefits
are
provided,
it's
not.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--where
all
the
money
is
available
to
provide
fixed
benefits.
but
at
the...
at
someone's
option,
variable
benefits
could
be
paid
instead.
that
is...
again,
let
me
say
that
this
is
a
hypothetical
that
hasn't
occurred,
and
i
think
that
it's
a
situation
where
the
department
of
labor
would
be
unhappy
with
the
conclusion
that
it
thinks
flows
from
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
right.
but
in...
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
in
this
case--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
in
this
case
it's
easy.
variable
benefits
could
never
be
paid.
the
free
funds,
while
they
were
in
the
general
account,
were
always
available
to
provide
fixed
benefits.
if
the
free
funds
were
withdrawn,
as
some
of
them
were,
they
still...
let
me
note
at
the
outset
that
when
they
revert
to
harris
trust
they
are,
of
course,
plan
assets,
and
the
harris
trust
is
a
fiduciary
with
respect
to
them.
and
all
harris
trust
can
do
with
them
is
pay
fixed
benefits
to
unisys
employees.
there
is
no
variable
option
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
but
let
me
make
clear
those
weren't
variable
benefits.
here's
what
happens
when
because
unisys
employees
have
been
promised
fixed
amounts,
if
hancock...
if
harris
trust
can't
get
the
money
from
hancock,
it
has
to
go
to
its
other
investments
or
it
has
to
go
back
to
unisys,
but
it
has
to
pay
those
benefits.
now
the
so-called
nonguaranteed
benefits
that
were
paid
for
a
brief
period
were
nothing
more
than
fixed...
fixed
monthly
defined
benefits
paid
to
certain
pensioners.
the
only
reason
they're
called
nonguaranteed
is
because
with
respect
to
those
pensioners
hancock
did
not
promise
to
pay
them
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
no
matter
how
the
general
account
performed.
hancock
merely
wrote
them
monthly
checks
at
harris
trust's
request.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
when
john
hancock
stopped
paying
them,
harris
trust
had
to
start
paying
them.
so
the
pensioners--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--while
the
money
was
in
hancock's
general
account
it
was
always
available
to
provide
guaranteed
benefit
at
harris
trust's
option.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
they
weren't
all
used
that
way,
but
it
always
provided
for
them.
and
let
me
say,
there's
a
difference
between
provided
for
and
committed
to.
congress
didn't
say
that
only
money
that's
committed
to
the
purchase
of
fixed
benefits
renders
it
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy.
it
says
provides
for,
and
we
believe
that
that
means
that
a
fund
of
money
that's
available
to
be
used
in
the
future
to
provide
fixed
benefits
makes
it
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
and
it
means
something
different
than
committed
to
pay
benefits
as
well.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
think
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
while
we
have
some
difficult
hypotheticals,
let
me
say
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
what
the
secretary
of
labor
is
concerned
about
would
be
if
hancock's
management
of
the
fund
directly
affected
the
amount
insured...
i'm
sorry,
that
pensioners
received.
that's
what
the
secretary
believes
that
congress
was
most
concerned
about.
and
since
that's
not
a
possibility
here,
this
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy.
the
hypothetical
you've
come
up
with,
which
doesn't
exist,
is
one
that
would
definitely
trouble
the
secretary
of
labor,
if
there
was
a
way
variable
benefits
could
get
paid
out
of
these
policies.
it
hasn't
arisen
yet.
let
me
say
that
it's
harris
trust's
interpretation
of
what
congress
did
that's
implausible
here.
they
have
the
conference
committee
dramatically
restructuring
the
way
pension
plans
and
insurance
companies
do
business
without
hinting
that
that's
what
they're
doing,
without
allowing
a
transition
period.
it's
the
secretary's
view
that
adoption
of
the
second
circuit's
approach
would
lead
insurance
companies
to
segregate
pension
plan
assets
into
separate
accounts.
they'd
have
to
move
billions
of
dollars
of
assets
into
separate
accounts.
congress
allowed
up
to
10
years
in
transition
periods
for
some
other
provisions
of
erisa
to
take
effect,
yet
here
harris
trust
says
congress
required
all
these
billions
of
dollars
of
assets
to
be
moved
and
didn't
give
them
any
time
to
do
it.
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
they
were
going
to
say
it?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
don't
think
congress
meant
to
do
it,
your
honor.
thank
you.
