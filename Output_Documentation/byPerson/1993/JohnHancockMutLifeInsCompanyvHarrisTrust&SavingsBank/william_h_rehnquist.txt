we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
92-1074,
john
hancock
mutual
life
insurance
company
v.
the
harris
trust
and
savings
bank.
mr.
kristol.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
contract's
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
free
funds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
mean...
when
you
say
a
guaranteed
benefit,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
a
fixed
amount,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fixed
at
a
dollar
amount.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
the
other
half
of
the
world
is
variable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought...
but
doesn't...
it
depends
on
the
option
being
in
the
hands
of
the
plan
trustee
and
not
the
insurance
company,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
there's
nothing
to
reserve.
thank
you,
mr.
kristol.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
mr.
wright,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
harris
had
to
pick
up
the
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
kill,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
assets
are
allocated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean
a
particular...
say...
supposing
the
john
hancock
owns
a
building
somewhere.
does
that
mean
that
that
particular
building
is
allocated
to
some
phase
of
its
business?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
well...
it
may
be,
but
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
i
was
asking
you
about
existing
practice,
not
what
would
happen.
you...
your...
i
thought
you
said
right
now
assets
are
segmented.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
then
i
want
to
know
what
segmenting
means.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
like
a
building.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
doing
what
with
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
just
to
a
casualty
line
of
business
or
the
life
line
of
business
or
the
pension
line
of
business.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
building
will
actually
come
to
be
allocated
to
some
particular
contract?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
say
very
well
be
permissible,
but
i
want
the
facts.
and
if
you
don't
know
them,
for
heaven's
sakes
say
so.
i
mean,
i
don't
know.
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
language
does
not
say
"provides".
it
says
"provides
for".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
doesn't
say
"provides
benefits".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
here
to
do
our
best
to
interpret
the
statute
correctly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
what
bearing
would
that
decision
construing
another
statute
have
on
this
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kill.
the
case
is
submitted.
