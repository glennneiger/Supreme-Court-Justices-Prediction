mr.
howard
g.
kristol
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
the
purchase
by
a
purchase...
the
purchase
by
a
pension
plan
of
an
insurance
policy
to
provide
guaranteed
annuities
to
plan
participants
and
beneficiaries.
under
the
provisions
of
the
contract,
the
premiums
paid
are
paid
into
john
hancock's
general
account
and
become
part
of
hancock's
general
corporate
assets.
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
hancock's
general
corporate
assets
are
also
to
be
considered
assets
of
the
plan.
hancock
unquestionably
exercises
authority
and
control
over
the
management
of
its
own
corporate
assets.
if
any
of
those
assets
are
also
deemed
to
be
plan
assets,
then
hancock
would
be
a
fiduciary
under
erisa
and
under
erisa's
fiduciary
rules
would
be
required
to
manage
its
corporate
assets,
or
at
least
a
part
of
them,
solely
in
the
interest
of
the
plan's
participants
and
beneficiaries.
congress
specifically
addressed
contracts
issued
by
insurance
companies
to
pension
plans
in
erisa
section
401(b)(2),
and
that
section
can
be
found
at
page
a-94
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
it
is
referenced
there
as
29
u.s.
code
section
1101(b)(2).
in
substance,
that
section
states
that
in
the
case
of
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy
issued
to
a
plan,
the
contract
itself
is
a
plan
asset,
but
the
insurance
company's
assets
are
not
plan
assets.
the
second
circuit
concluded
in
this
case,
the
gac
50,
the
contract
in
issue,
is,
in
part
at
least,
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy
within
the
meaning
of
section
401(b)(2),
and
that
hancock
is
not
a
fiduciary
to
the
extent
that
guaranteed
benefits
have
already
been
purchased
by
the
trustee
under
the
contract.
that
court
went
on
to
hold,
however,
that
hancock
should
be
considered
to
be
a
fiduciary
with
respect
to
what
the
court
referred
to
as
the
contract's
free
funds.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
free
funds,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
free
funds.
hancock
and
the
government
take
the
position
that
hancock
is
not
a
fiduciary
at
all
with
respect
to
its
corporate
assets
because
harris
trust,
as
the
plan
trustee,
has
at
all
times
had
the
right
under
gac
50
to
purchase
additional
guaranteed
benefits
to
the
full
extent
of
the
contract's
so-called
free
funds.
the
contract
in
its
entirety,
therefore,
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy
under
section
401(b)(2).
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
no,
i'm
not
sure
i
would
agree
with
that
formulation,
justice
scalia.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
that
is
correct.
well,
i
think
that
they
would
ultimately--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--no,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
the
contract
itself,
all
of
the
funds
held
under
the
contract,
whether
they
stay
with
john
hancock
or
are
ultimately
taken
out
of
the
contract
by
the
plan
trustee,
would
ultimately
be
used
for
benefits
for
participants
and
beneficiaries.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
not
necessarily,
no.
this
contract
not
only
provided
that
the
plan
could
purchase
additional
guaranteed
benefits
to
the
full
extent
of
the
contract's
free
funds,
but
it
also
provided
other
possibilities
as
well
at
the
option
of
the
plan
trustee.
and
among
those
options,
of
course,
was
the
ability
to
use
the
so-called
free
funds
to
purchase
or
to
provide
so-called
nonguaranteed
benefits.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
my
view
of
it,
justice
souter,
would
be
that
if
it's
called
an
insurance
contract,
it
would
necessarily
have
guaranteed
benefits
of
some
sort.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
within...
well,
yes,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
no...
no--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--no,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
i
can
envisage
a
contract
that
would
provide
in
its
entirety,
as
this
one
does,
for
guaranteed
benefits
in
the
way
that
i've
described
it,
that
also
could
provide
within
the
same
contract
that
the
plan
trustee
could
use
the
free
funds
to
pay
nonguaranteed
benefits.
and
i
could
visualize,
though
i
don't
believe
any
such
contract
has
ever
existed,
that
it
would
provide
for
variable
benefits.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
the
result
is--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--the...
well,
the
result
is
the
same.
the
only
thing
that
congress
required
in
401(b)(2)
is
that
the
contract--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--the
(2)(b)
exemption,
referring
to
401(2)(b).
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
i
don't...
i
don't
know
that
i
would
characterize
it
as
an
exemption.
but
the
answer
is
that
the
john
hancock
would
not
be
a
fiduciary
with
respect
to
any
of
the
assets
held
under
the
contract.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
if...
yes,
if
you
want
to
use
that
term,
that's
correct.
so
long
as
the
contract
provides
for
guaranteed
benefits
either
immediately
or
at
some
time
in
the
future
at
the
option
of
the
plan
trustee,
then
the
contract
in
its
entirety
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy
even
though
the
contract
might
also
provide
options
to
the
plan
trustee
to
use
the
so-called
free
funds
to
provide
nonguaranteed
benefits.
and
also
in
the
example
that
justice
souter
asked
me
about,
suppose
there
was
a
contract
that
also
said
the
trustee
could
use
these
funds
to
provide
variable
annuities.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
well,
the
insurance
company,
of
course,
is
entering
into
a
contract
with
a
fiduciary,
the
plan
trustee.
and
the
contract,
if
it
provides
for
guaranteed
benefits
to
the
full
extent
of
the
book
value
of
the
contract,
yes,
that
contract
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy
irrespective
of
the
other
options.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
to
the
extent
that
i'm
familiar
with
insurance
contracts,
meaning
contracts
that
provide
for
guaranteed
benefits,
the
answer,
of
course,
is
they
provide
somewhere--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--somewhere.
but
i
assume
that
there
are
contracts
that
are
issued
that
don't
provide
for
any
guaranteed
benefits.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
if
the
free
funds
portion
was
not
available
to
use...
to
be
used
for
additional
guaranteed
benefits,
which
is
the
situation
you're
positing.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
i
would
think
that
to
that
extent
the
contract...
to
that
extent...
the
contract
provides
guaranteed
benefits
to
the
extent
of
the
guaranteed
benefits
that
have
been
purchased.
because,
by
definition,
the
balance
of
the
funds
under
the
contract
are
not
available
for
that
purpose.
i
should
like
to
add,
though,
i
don't
think
any
such
contract
exists.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
i
think
for
all
practical
purposes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
a
separate
account
contract,
a
variable
annuity
contract.
that
is,
i
believe
that
the
definition
which
is
a
functional
description
of
a
general
account
contract
deals
with
the...
one
half
of
the
universe
of
the
contracts
issued
by
insurance
companies.
they're
either
general
account
contracts
and
they
provide
guaranteed
benefits,
not
necessarily
in
their
entirety
but
typically,
and
the
other
hand
variable
annuity
contracts.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
it
means,
in
the
pension
context,
that
the
benefits
payable
to
plan
participants
are
fixed
in
amount
by
the
plan.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
fixed
at
a
monthly
dollar
amount
typically,
that's
correct.
it--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--the
other
half
of
the
world
would
be
separate
account
contracts,
some
of
which
provide
for
variable
annuities,
and
then
there's
a
whole
variety
of
other
kinds
of
separate
account
products.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
they
were
fixed
but
nonguaranteed,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
that's
correct.
the
plan
provided,
as
i
understand
it,
only
for
fixed
benefits.
and
then
under
this
contract,
to
the
extent
that
the
plan
trustee
purchased
guaranteed
benefits
under
the
contract,
then
the
monthly
benefits
to
those
retirees
were
guaranteed
by
the
general
account
of
john
hancock.
as
to
any
other
retirees,
for
example
those
that
the
plan
trustee
might
decide
that
they
wanted
to
pay
the
monthly
benefit
using
money
available
to
the
plan,
there
was
the...
this
1977
amendment
which
permitted
the
plan
trustee
to
use
funds
held
by
john
hancock
in
this
contract
to
pay
those
monthly
benefits,
but
the
benefits
were
never
guaranteed
by
john
hancock.
of
course,
when
they
were
paid
they
were
paid.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
no,
your
honor,
it
has
not.
and
i
think
that's
largely
because
that
decision...
in
that
decision
the
seventh
circuit
itself
quizzed...
questioned
the
correctness
of
the
decision
on
the
motion
for
reconsideration.
it
was
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court,
and
i
think
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
was
decide
that
a
claim
under
erisa
had
been
stated,
and
i
think
they
even
doubted
that
by
the
time
they
ruled
on
the
motion
for
reconsideration.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
know
what
the
followup
is.
there's
no
other
reported
decision
and
i,
frankly,
don't
know
what
happened
to
the
case.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
i
think,
for
all
practical
purposes,
that's
correct,
it
would
not
have
any
difference.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
the
example,
but
i
think
i
can
say
plainly
what
i
mean
in
relation
to
the
statute,
that
if
the
contract
provides
that
the
entire
book
value
of
the
contract
can
be
applied
by
the
plan
trustee
to
provide
guaranteed
benefits
which
would
be
fixed
guaranteed
benefits,
the
contract
in
its
entirety
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy
within
the
meaning
of
this
section
of
erisa.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
that
isn't
a
construct
i'm
aware
of.
i'm
having
trouble,
your
honor--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--i
hope
i
didn't
leave
that
impression.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
if
the
plan
trustee
has
a
right
to
provide
additional
guaranteed
benefits,
in
our
view
the
contract
in
its
entirety
is
a
guaranteed
benefit.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
you
made
reference
to
a
guaranteed
plan.
the
plan
in
this
case
provided
for
fixed
benefits.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
in
your--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--yes,
that...
that
is
a
description
of
gac
50.
as
the
free
funds
under
the
contract
grew,
the
plan
trustee,
of
course,
had
more
funds
available
to
pay
his
nonguaranteed
benefits.
that
doesn't
change
the
analysis
under
the
statute.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
the
option
would
always
be
in
the
hands
of
the
trustee,
if
there's
an
option.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
no.
that's
a
difficult
question,
but
the
answer
is
no.
so
long
as
the
free
funds
can
be
used
to
purchase
guaranteed
benefits,
then
it
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
in
its
entirety
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
and
if
the
contract
in
part
provided
for
the
use...
for
that
purpose
and
some
portion
of
the
free
funds
could
not
be
used
for
guaranteed
benefits
under
this
contract,
then
to
the
extent
that
language
would
come
into
play.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
well,
state
law
would
require
that
if
variable
benefits
were
to
be
paid,
variable
annuity
benefits,
they
would
have
to
be
paid
out
of
a
separate
account.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
no,
your
honor.
in
answering
the
question
that
i
believe
justice
souter
posed,
to
the
extent
that
language
refers
to...
in
using
the
case
that's
involved
here...
the
free
funds,
if
all
of
the
free
funds
can
be
used
to
purchase
guaranteed
benefits,
then
the
contract
in
its
entirety
is
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy.
if
some
of
the
assets
can
be
used
to
purchase
guaranteed
benefits
but
not
all
of
the
assets,
that's
when
the
"to
the
extent",
that
language
comes
into
play.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
no,
that's
not
correct.
i'm
not
reading
it
as
if
because
i
didn't
say,
"if
in
part".
all
of
the
free
funds
have
to
be
available
to
be
used
to
purchase
additional
guaranteed
benefits--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
if
the...
that
is
correct,
justice.
if
he
withdrew
the
funds--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--to
buy
additional
guaranteed
benefits
to
the
full
extent
of
the
contract's--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--if
the
plan
took
the
money
out
of
the
contract?
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
well,
it's
a
negotiated
price.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
no.
the
paf
isn't
a
fund
at
all.
it
doesn't...
it's
not
assets.
neither
are
free
funds
asset
or
funds.
the
paf--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--the
paf
is
merely
a
term
that
refers
to
the
book
value
of
the
contract
as
reflected
on
the
books
of
the
company.
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
may
i
reserve,
your
honor--
mr.
howard
g.
kristol
--thank
you.
