justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you,
if
i
may,
a
complementary
question.
does
john
hancock,
in
issuing
policies
to
plans
like
this,
ever
issue
anything
that
might
be
called
an
insurance
contract
that
does
not
provide
for
some
guaranteed
benefit?
justice
david
h.
souter
at
least
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
if
that
is
the
case,
then,
then
the
exception
the...
"to
the
extent"
of
language,
whatever
it
means,
will
never
have
any
operative
effect,
will
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it
will
always
be
tagged
onto...
i
mean
it
will
always
refer
to
a
contract
to
which
the
disputed
amounts
are
tagged
on
to
some
level
of
guaranteed
benefit.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
would
at
least
distinguish
it
from
the
argument
that
you're
making
here.
i
see
your
point,
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
a
practical
matter...
i
think
you
may
already
have
answered
this
for
me,
mr.
kristol,
but
as
a
practical
matter
do
you
know
of
any
instances
in
which
your
company,
at
least,
has
issued
a
policy
in
these
circumstances
without
providing
for
some
guaranteed
benefit
option
for
the
use
of
the
free
funds?
justice
david
h.
souter
by
definition,
you're
saying,
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
are
going
to...
if
we're
going
to
follow
the
definition
of
insurance
contract
as
you're
using
it
and
as
we
all
assume
the
statute
is
using
it,
then...
well,
no,
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
answer.
is
it
necessarily
the
case
that
there
could
be
an
insurance
contract...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
saying
this
badly.
couldn't
you
have
an
insurance
contract
that
simply
made
no
provision
for
the
purchase
of
any
guaranteed
benefit
or
additional
guaranteed
benefit
with
the
free
funds?
that's...
that
would
be
an
insurance
contract
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
what
is
the
converse
of
a
guaranteed
benefit
policy?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
there
were
no...
if
there
were
a
case
in
which
the
only
option
for
the
use
of
the
free
funds,
written
right
into
the
contract,
was
to
provide
variable
annuities,
then
it
would
take
it
out
of
your...
the
rule
that
you're
urging
us
to
adopt
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
just
didn't
state
my
point
clearly
enough.
if
the...
if
the
provision
were
that
free
funds
may
be
used
only
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
variable
annuities,
then
you
would
be
outside
the
rule
that
you're
urging
us
to
adopt
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
different
result.
i
understand
your
brief
to
represent
that
for
variable
benefits
under
state
insurance
laws
in
all
the
states
you
can't
use
general
account
contracts?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
will
be
candid
to
say
i
don't
understand
why
you're
not
reading
"to
the
extent
that"
simply
to
mean
if.
because
you're
saying
if
it
is
a
contingency
in
the
contract
that
free
funds
may
be
used
at
the...
to...
in
part,
at
least,
to
purchase
further
guaranteed
benefits,
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
reading
the
phrase
to
mean
if.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
all
the
funds
may
be
available,
but
if
the
trust...
if
the
person
exercising
the
option
may
use
all
of
those
available
free
funds
but
chooses
to
use
only
a
portion
of
them,
you
would
have
us
adopt
the
rule
of
construction,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
say
governs
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what's
the...
what's
the
status
before
they
decide
what
to
do
with
the
money?
what's
the
status
of
the
free
funds?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
weren't,
in
fact,
paying
them
during
part
of
the
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
provides
for
benefits
means
something
other
than
provides
benefits.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
a
lot
more
than
mere
allocation.
i
mean
that
is
mere
allocation
and
separate
investment
treatment,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't...
isn't
that
really
what
justice
stevens
was
getting
at
when
he
was
speaking
of
the
need
to
segregate
funds?
