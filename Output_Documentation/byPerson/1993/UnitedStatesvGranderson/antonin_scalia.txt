i
don't
understand
why
it
trumps
anything
inconsistent,
because
subsection
(2),
which
is
the
"any
other
sentence
that
was
available.
"
provision,
is
trumped
by
the
proviso
after
it
which
says,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision".
justice
antonin
scalia
not
less
than
one-third.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
one
more.
this
is
a
minimum
provision
that
we're
talking
about,
and
really
the
only
thing
at
issue
is
whether
the
sentencing
judge
is...
i
suppose
it's
whether
he
is
able
to
go
above...
whether
he
is
both
able
and
compelled
to
go
above
the
maximum
that
was
available
at
the
time
of
the
original
offense.
it
is
both
whether
he
is
able
to
and
whether
he
is
compelled
to,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
guess
you
are.
the
maximum
incarceration
term
originally
was
six
months.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--smith,
maybe
you've
been
too
generous
here.
i
suppose
your
first
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
were
you
not
so
generous,
is
that
you
don't
mind
interpreting
this
thing
literally.
if
you
interpret
it
literally,
you
end
up
with
a
probation
term
of
one-third
the
original
sentence,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
once
we...
and
literally,
that's
clearly
what
it
means,
and
once
we
depart
from
that,
the
issue
is
simply
whether
we
take
a...
i
mean,
really,
to
call
it
a
nonliteral
interpretation
doesn't
really
do
justice
to
what
a
leap
it
is...
we
take
a
fanciful
interpretation,
should
we
take
a
fanciful
interpretation
that
favors
your
client,
or
the
fanciful
interpretation
that
favors
the
government?
that's
really
the
choice,
because
the
only
literal
interpretation
gives
your
client,
as
punishment,
one-third
of
his
original
probation
term.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
smith,
if
we
adopt
your
interpretation,
is
it
always
the
more
lenient
for
the
defendant,
or
does
it
just
happen
to
be
in
the
case
of
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know...
there's
no
situation
in
which
using
the
government's
system
would
produce
a
lower
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
change
from
prior
law
unless
it
is
specifically
mentioned
in
the
legislative
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can't
make
any
changes
in
conference
committee,
for
example.
that's
sort
of
a
constraint
upon
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
disagree
with
much
more
than
that.
i
wouldn't
use
it
at
all,
but
to
say
that
a
piece
of
legislation
is
ineffective
unless
the
text
of
the
statute
is
supported
by
legislative
history
is
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
strange
to
think
that
if
congress
did
have
in
mind
the
old
system,
and
was
referring
to
one-third
of
the
original
sentence
that
was
suspended,
i
wonder,
it
was
always
my
understanding
that
if
you
violated
the
terms
of
your
probation,
not
just
one-third
of
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
would
be
given
you,
but
in
fact
the
whole
term.
would
it
be
normal
to
revoke
probation,
which
was
a
grace
from
a
sentence
that
was
presumably
a
considered
sentence?
revoke
the
probation,
and
then
say,
but
we're
not
going
to
give
you
your
original
sentence,
we're
just
going
to
give
you
one-third
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
under
the
old
system
that
justice
o'connor
was
referring
to.
it
had
always
been
my
assumption
that
if
you
violated
your
probation,
what
would
happen
is
that
the
original
sentence...
the
full
term
of
it,
not
one-third
of
it...
would
come
down
upon
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
guess
if
that's
what
they
want
to
change
it
to,
it
must
not
mean
that
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
subsequent
legislative
history
we're
talking
about
now,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
future...
future
history,
so
to
speak.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
i
think
you've
just
given
me
an
example
in
which
the
government's
interpretation
would
be
more
lenient
to
the
defendant
than
yours.
wasn't
that
the
point
of
your
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
point
was
that
you
should
be
able,
in
the
event
of
murder,
to
consider
going
higher,
to
consider
going
beyond
the
guidelines
range,
wasn't
that
your
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hungar,
how
does
the
rule
of
lenity
work?
i'm
not
real
sure
how
it
works.
if...
just
make
believe
the
rule...
we
decide
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenity.
would
that
give
us
a
constant
interpretation
of
this
statute,
depending
upon
what
kind
of
a
situation
first
comes
before
us,
or
rather,
would
we
interpret
the
statute
leniently
to
the
first
defendant
and
then
also
leniently
to
the
second
defendant,
depending
upon
which
interpretation
works
case
by
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
in...
that's
mis...
it
seems
to
me
in
3583(g),
the
supervised
release
provision
you're
talking
about,
they
made
it
very
clear.
they
said,
"and
require
the
defendant
to
serve
in
prison--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"#
not
less
than
one-third
of
the
term
of
supervised
release.
"
and
there's
no
such
language
here.
