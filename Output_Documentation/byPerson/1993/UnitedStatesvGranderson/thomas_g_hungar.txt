mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
was
convicted
of
a
felony
that
carries
a
maximum
sentence
of
5
years
in
prison.
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
the
presumptive
imprisonment
range
was
zero
to
6
months.
instead
of
sending
respondent
to
prison,
the
district
court
imposed
a
sentence
of
60
months
probation.
shortly
after
he
began
serving
that
sentence,
respondent
tested
positive
for
cocaine,
and
the
district
court
revoked
his
probation
and
sentenced
him
to
20
months
in
prison.
the
court
imposed
that
sentence
under
18
u.s.c.
section
3565
(a),
which
provides
that
when
a
defendant
possesses
illegal
drugs
while
on
probation,
the
court
shall
revoke
the
sentence
of
probation
and
sentence
the
defendant
to
not
less
than
one-third
of
the
original
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
phrase
"original
sentence"
refers
to
the
presumptive
range
of
imprisonment
that
could
have
been
imposed
under
the
guidelines
rather
than
the
sentence
of
probation
that
was
actually
imposed.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
our
argument
has
two
parts.
first,
the
interpretation
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
urged
by
respondent
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
must
be
rejected.
second,
once
respondent's
interpretation
has
been
rejected,
there
are
only
two
suggested
ways
to
read
the
statute,
and
of
those,
only
our
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
structure,
context,
and
purpose.
turning
to
the
first
point,
our
principal
disagreement
with
respondent
concerns
the
plain
meaning
of
the
phrase,
"original
sentence".
in
our
view,
under
either
the
dictionary
definition,
or
the
ordinary,
common
sense
understanding
of
that
phrase,
it
has
only
one
possible
meaning
in
the
context
of
federal
sentencing
law.
it
means
the
initial
judgment
of
the
court
specifying
the
punishment
to
be
imposed
on
a
convicted
criminal.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
with
respect,
justice
souter,
we
don't
agree
with
that.
we
certainly
agree
that
we
have
to
take
plain
meaning
all
the
way,
but
the
fact
that
"original
sentence"
means
the
sentence
of
probation
that
was
imposed
in
this
case
does
not
mean
that
the
defendant
here
had
to
be
sentenced
to
a
new
sentence
of
probation,
and
there
are
two
reasons
why
that
is
so.
we
agree
that
the
phrase,
"one-third
of
the
original
sentence",
if
considered
in
isolation,
has
two
possible
meanings.
it
could
refer
to
the
length
of
the
original
sentence,
in
this
case
20
months,
or
to
the
length
and
the
type
of
the
original
sentence,
in
this
case
20
months
of
probation,
and
if
that
were
the
only
thing
we
had
to
go
on,
the
answer
you
suggest
would
be
the
only
one
possible
under
the
rule
of
lenity,
but
we
have
other
guides
to
congressional
intent
here.
first,
and
most
important,
is
the
context
in
which
that
provision,
one-third
of
the
original
sentence,
rests.
in
section
3565(a),
congress
required
the
court
to
revoke
the
sentence
of
probation
before
resentencing
the
defendant.
the
word
"revoke"
is
a
term
of
art
in
federal
sentencing
law
in
the
context
of
probation
or
other
forms
of
conditional
release.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
do
agree
with
that,
justice
blackmun.
if
congress
had
more
clearly
expressed
its
intention,
then
obviously
we
wouldn't
be
here,
but
we
don't
believe
the
statute
is
so
poorly
drafted
that
we
can't
discern,
by
applying
normal
rules
of
statutory
construction,
the
meaning
that
congress
in
fact
intended.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
as
i
understand
the
preexisting
sentencing
scheme,
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
a
possible
sentence,
because
the
way
probation
formerly
worked
was
that
it
was
an
alternative
to
imprisonment.
a
judge
would
either
impose
a
sentence
of
imprisonment,
and
then
suspend
the
execution--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
don't
know
whether
it
was
always
true,
but
certainly
prior
to
the
1984
sentencing
reform
act
the
law
was
that
probation
was
an
alternative
to
imprisonment.
the
judge
would
either
impose
a
sentence
and
then
suspend
the
execution
of
that
sentence,
or
would
suspend
sentencing,
so
either
there
would
be
a
suspended
sentence
of
imprisonment,
or
no
sentence
at
all,
then
the
defendant
would
be
on
probation,
but
probation
could
not...
you
couldn't
sentence
a
defendant
to
so
many
years
of
prison
followed
by
so
many
years
of
probation.
that
wasn't
possible.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
also
true,
your
honor.
probation
was
imposed
in
lieu
of
the
sentence.
it
was...
the
judge
either
suspended
the
sentence
or
suspended
imposition
of
sentence
and
placed
the
defendant
on
probation
was
the
language
of
the
prior
statute.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
depends.
if
the
minimum
required
by
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
within
the
guidelines
range,
then
the
guidelines
maximum
would
be
the
maximum,
because...
because
this
provision
of
section
3565(a)
only
trumps
the
other
provisions
of
section
3565
to
the
extent
they're
inconsistent.
to
the
extent
they're
not
inconsistent,
they
continue
to
govern,
so
if
the
minimum
is
within
the
guidelines
range
or
below
the
guidelines
range,
the
top
of
the
guidelines
range
would
still
be
the
maximum,
because--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
in
this
case
it's
6
months,
which
is...
so
the
guidelines
range
is
not
the
maximum.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the
maximum
sentence
is
5
years
if
the
court
wishes
to
depart
from
the...
and
has
grounds
for
an
upward
departure
from
the
guidelines
range,
but
normally
the
maximum
sentence
that
is
available
under
subchapter
(a),
which
is
the
language
of
3565(a)(2).
you
see,
our
position
is
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
last
provision
of
section
3565(a),
the
provision
we're
discussing
here,
only
imposes
a
mandatory
minimum.
it
doesn't
change
what
otherwise
would
be
the
maximum
sentence.
so
to
the
extent
that...
for
instance,
if
the
guidelines
range
here
were
15
to
25
months,
and
the
mandatory
minimum
under
this
statute
were
20
months,
the
defendant
could
be
sentenced
to...
obviously
would
have
to
be
sentenced
to
20
months.
the
court
could
sentence
him
up
to
25
months
because...
because
the
provisions
of
3565(a)(2),
which
normally
govern
revocation
and
which
provide
that
the
court
can
impose
any
sentence
that
would
otherwise
have
been
available
under
subchapter
(a),
that
provision
would
permit
the
court
to
go
up
to
25
months,
because
a
25-month
sentence
would
also
have
been
available
under
subchapter
(a)
at
the
time
of
the
initial
sentencing,
so
the
mandatory
minimum
20
months
trumps
anything
in
section
3565
to
the
extent
it's
inconsistent,
but
to
the
extent
there's
something
in
3565
that
would
permit
a
higher
sentence,
that
continues
to
have
effect.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
but
the
"notwithstanding"
proviso
only
requires
a
mandatory
minimum.
it
doesn't
say
the
rest
of
sentencing
law
is
totally
inapplicable
here.
all
it
says
is,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
section,
this
mandatory
minimum
sentence
must
be
imposed.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
so
to
the
extent
other
provisions
of
section
3565
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
mandatory
minimum,
they
continue
to
govern.
now,
if
the
mandatory
minimum,
as
in
this
case,
is
higher
than
the
guidelines
range,
is
higher
than
any
other
sentence
available
under
subchapter
(a),
then
our
position
is
that
the
mandatory
minimum
is
also
the
maximum,
because
the
guidelines
provide
that
when
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
exceeds
the
normal
guidelines
range,
then
that
mandatory
minimum
sentence
shall
be
the
guideline
sentence,
and
you
can't
go
higher
than
that.
further
on
the
point
of
why
the
word
"revoke"
demonstrates
that
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
rather
than
a
sentence
of
probation
is
required,
the
word
"revoke"
is
a
term
of
art
in
federal
sentencing
law
when
applied
to
probate
or
other
forms
of
conditional
release.
it
means
that,
at
least
for
a
time,
the
defendant
has
lost
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
conditional
release.
section
3565(a)(2)
demonstrates
that
in
the
context
of
probation,
under
the
current
sentencing
scheme,
it
makes
clear
that
once
a
court
has
revoked
a
defendant's
probation,
probation
is
no
longer
an
option,
and
some
other
sentence
must
be
imposed,
so
by
using
the
word
3565(a),
the
provision
at
issue
here,
congress
made
clear--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
first
of
all--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
maximum
probationary
sentence
is
5
years,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that
applied,
right.
we
don't
think
so,
because
that's
not
the
way
"revoke"
is
used
in
federal
sentencing
law.
it
doesn't
mean,
terminate
conditional
release
with
the
option
of
then
imposing
a
new
sentence
of
conditional
release.
what
it
means
is,
you
have
lost
your
chance
to
enjoy
conditional
liberty,
and
you're
going
to
go
to
prison--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
the
dichotomy
in
section--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
dichotomy
in-section
3565(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)
demonstrates
this
point,
and
this
applies
not
merely
to
probation
under
this
statute,
but
the
same
is
true
under
previous
statutes,
the
same
is
true
for
supervised
release
and
parole.
when
revocation
occurs,
as
a
rule
the
defendant
goes
to
jail,
and
at
the
very
least,
conditional
liberty
is
no
longer
possible,
and
in
section
3565(a)(1),
the
court
has
an
option
of
continuing
the
defendant
on
probation,
the
same
probation
and
extending
the
term
if
the
court
wishes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
justice
kennedy,
because
that
would
not
be
revocation,
that
would
be
continuous.
that's
the
dichotomy
of
section
3565(a).
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
our
point
is
that
congress
uses
these
words
in
a
certain
way,
and
in
the
federal
sentencing
scheme,
throughout
the
scheme
it
consistently
uses
the
word
"revoke"
to
mean
you
are
no
longer
going
to
enjoy
conditional
release.
it
uses
the
word
3565(a)(1)
the
first
option
a
court
normally
has
when
a
defendent
violates
probation
is
to
continue
the
defendant
on
probation
with
or
without
extending
the
term
or
modifying
or
enhancing
the
conditions
of
probation.
so
if
that
were
what
congress
had
meant,
if
congress
had
meant,
the
court
should
have
the
option
of
continuing
the
defendant
on
probation,
and
modifying
the
terms
or
conditions,
then
that's
what
it
would
have
said,
because
that
is
what
it
said
in
3565(a)(1),
but
instead
congress
said
"revoke",
and
"revoke"--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--exactly.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
it
also
uses
the
word
"revoke"
which
has
indicated...
always
means--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
our
point
is
that
whenever
anybody
else
says
this--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
it's
a
fundamental
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
we
generally
construe
words
used
by
congress
in
a
particular
statute
to
mean
the
same
thing.
every
other
place
in
the
statute
the
word
"revoke"
is
used,
that's
what
it
means.
we
submit,
congress
must
have
meant
the
same
thing
here.
and
there's
another
reason
why
we
must
reach
that
conclusion,
and
that's
because
it
would
be
absurd
as
even
respondent
concedes
to
construe
the
statute
as
you
are
suggesting.
no
court
of
appeals
has
done
so
for
the
obvious
reason
that
it--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
the
first
place
it's
not
clear
in
that
case
if
it
would
be
permissible...
because
the
maximum
sentence
for
probation
is
five
years,
it's
not
clear
that
this
statute
would
authorize
an
additional
sentence
on
top
of
those
five
years.
but
leaving
that
point
aside,
accepting
the
case
as
you've
hypothesized,
that
is,
a
defendant
who
hasn't
done
anything
wrong
until
the
last
few
months
of
a
lengthy
probationary
sentence.
that
is,
in
most
cases,
where
this
arises,
where
the
defendant
is
in
the
first
two
thirds
of
his
probationary
sentence.
this
statute,
as
you're
suggesting
it
be
construed,
would
make
possible
a
more
lenient
sentence
than
is
otherwise
ever
possible
if...
finding
a
violation
of
probation.
formerly,
absent
this
provision,
the
defendant
had
been
found...
violated
his
probation
forbidding
him
from
possessing
drugs,
the
court
would
have
only
two
options.
they
could
continue
the
defendant
on
the
same
term
of
probation
with
or
without
extending
that
term
or
modifying
the
conditions.
that
is,
the
court
couldn't
shorten
the
term
of
probation.
it
could
extend
it
or
leave
it
the
same.
but
a
court
could
revoke
probation,
which
means
the
defendant
no
longer
gets
probation
at
all
and
will
be
sent
to
prison.
the
court
did
not
have
the
option
of
shortening
the
term
of
probation.
but
under
your
hypothesis
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
this
provision
would
provide
a...
the
possibility
of
a
more
lenient
sentence
a
shorter
term
of
probation
than
is
otherwise
permitted
by
law.
it
would
be
absurd
to
think
that
congress,
in
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1988
where
it
was
trying
to
reduce
the
demand
for
illegal
drugs
and
discourage
drug
use
and
possession
would
have
enacted
a
provision
that
permits
a
person
to
use
drugs
to
be
rewarded
by
the
possibility
of
a
more
lenient
sentence
than
is
otherwise
possible.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
maximum
penalty
for
simple
possession
by
a
non-federal
inmate
is
twelve
months.
interestingly,
if
mr.
granderson
had
been
imprisoned,
if
the
judge
sentenced
him
to
prison
rather
than
placing
him
on
probation
and
mr.
granderson
had
then
possessed
cocaine
in
prison,
the
maximum
penalty--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
mr.
granderson
is
in
a
very
different
position
from
a
person
who
is
simply
prosecuted
for
possession
of
drugs.
mr.
granderson
was
given
a
second
chance.
he
committed
a
felony
punishable
by
up
to
five
years
in
prison
and
the
judge
didn't
require
him
to
spend
one
day
in
prison.
he
placed
him
on
probation,
conditional
liberty
conditioned
on
mr.
granderson.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
know
that
it
was
done
both
ways.
what
the
relative
frequency
of--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--if
that
were
the
practice
under
current
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
and
it
would
show
that
congress
intended
the
defendant
to
serve
a
significant
term
of
imprisonment,
but
since
that
is
not
the
way
the
current
sentencing
scheme
works,
and
we
always
assume
the
congress
knows
the
law
when
it
amends
the
law
we
can't
assume
that
congress.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
your
honor
this
was
enacted
in
1988
as
part
of
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1988
and
the
sentencing
guidelines,
the
sentencing
reform
act
was
enacted
in
1984,
and
the
sentencing
guidelines
went
into
effect
in
1987.
when
this
was
enacted,
current
law
was
as
we've
described
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well
there
are
two
different...
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
maximum.
we
think
clearly
it
requires
the
court
to
go
above
the
guidelines
range
if
the
mandatory
minimum
yields
that
result,
yes.
i'm
not
sure
i
am
answering
your
question.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
maximum
incarceration
term
originally
was
five
years.
the
maximum
in
the
guidelines
range
was
six
months.
this
court
can
always
depart
on
similar
grounds,
but
yes,
we're
saying
this
judge
had
to
impose
more
than
the
maximum
under
the
guidelines
because
that's...
we
believe
that's
the
only
fair
interpretation
of
what
the
words
of
this
statute
require.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
have
a
few
brief
points
i'd
like
to
make.
first,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
whether
there
would
be
a
class
of
defendants
who
had
been
sentenced
under
the
previous
scheme,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
this
statute...
the
effective
date
of
this
provision
was
to
those
defendants
whose
term
of
probation
began
in
1989.
that
is,
after
december
31st,
1988.
this
statute
was
enacted
in
i
believe
in...
well,
it
was
adopted
by
congress
in
october
of
1988.
so
because
probation
begins
under
the
statute
upon
imposition
of
the
sentence,
anyone
who
received
a
sentence
of
probation
that
would
be
covered
by
this
statute
would
have
done
so
after
the
statute
went
into
effect.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
because
the
effective
date
provision
of
this
particular
statute
at
section
7303(d)
of
the
1988
act,
which
added
this
amendment...
the
effective
date
of
this
provision,
it
applies
to
sentences
of
probation
that
begin
after
december
31st,
1988,
so
in
your
hypothetical,
it
would
not
be
subject
to
this
provision.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
this
statute
would
not
apply
to
that
person,
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
i
have
the
language
here.
it's
section
7303(d)
of
the
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
of
the
1988
act,
and
it
provides,
"the
amendments
made
by
this
section
shall
apply
with
respect
to
persons
whose
probation
begins
after
december
31st,
1988.
"
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
whether
there
are
any
cases
in
which
the
government's
interpretation
would
be
more
lenient,
there
are
such
cases.
in
fact,
there
was
a
district
court
case
which
we
didn't
cite
in
our
brief
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
united
states
against
harrison,
815
f.
supp.
494,
and
in
that
case
the
judge
held
that
the
government's
interpretation
was
more
lenient,
and
therefore,
regardless
of
the
ambiguity,
the
rule
of
lenity
required
adoption
of
the
government's
interpretation,
because
there
the
guidelines
range
was
97
to
121
months,
and
the
court
had
departed
downward
and
imposed
probation,
but
then
the
defendant--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
sentencing
commission
statistics,
the
1991
and
1992
annual
report,
suggest
that
only
5
to
10
percent
of
probationary
sentences
are
downward
departures,
but
of
course,
in
those
downward
departures,
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
effect
of
applying
respondent's
interpretation
would
have
been
to
mandate
a
sentence
of
over
40
months
in
prison,
which
is
far
more
than
our
interpretation
could
ever
mandate,
but
it's
true
that
in
most
cases
that
would
not
be
the
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true,
your
honor.
there
are
limitations
that
are
more
strict
in
some
cases
than
in
probation,
but
it's
interesting
to
note
that
of
the
12
court
of
appeals
cases
of
which
we're
aware
that
apply
this
provision,
granderson
is
the
only
one
in
which
the
defendant
received
5
years
of
probation.
in
every
other
one
of
those
cases
the
defendant
received
no
more
than
3
years
of
probation,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
statistics
indicating
whether
supervised
release
or
probation
on
average
is
longer.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
think
the
rule
of
lenity
requires
a
constant
interpretation.
you
can't
determine
lenity
based
solely
on
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
and
then
have
the
statute
mean
different
things,
depending
on
the
particular
defendant
before
the
court.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
absolutely,
justice
souter,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--our...
well,
i
suppose
you
would
also
have
to
consider
the
degree
of
lenity.
that
is,
it
may
be
slightly
more
lenient
here
and
far
more
harsh
there,
and
that
would
be
taken
into
consideration
as
well,
but
our
principal
submission
is
that
the
rule
of
lenity
does
not
apply.
it
certainly
doesn't
apply
to
permit
adoption
of
respondent's
interpretation.
if
it
applies,
then
the
only
way
to
construe
the
statute
is
to
require
a
new,
shorter
term
of
probation,
which
we
think
is
absurd,
but
can't
require
respondent's
interpretation,
because
respondent's
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
right...
no,
your
honor,
the
rule
of
lenity,
as
this
court
said
last
term
in
the
smith
v.
united
states
case,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
the
rule
of
lenity
doesn't
come
into
play
to
let
you
choose
between
one
interpretation
that
is
consistent
with
the
language
and
another
that's
not.
the
rule
of
lenity
just
doesn't
permit
you
to
adopt
an
interpretation
that
is
barred
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
that's
my
next
point,
your
honor.
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
i
think
and
others
have
suggested
that
our
interpretation
is
not
consistent
with
the
plain
language,
so
we
just
have
to
pick
and
choose
between
various
inconsistent
interpretations...
that
is,
interpretations
that
aren't
consistent
with
the
plain
language,
but
our
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
plain
language.
it
is
possible
for
the
phrase,
"one-third
of
the
original
sentence",
to
refer
to
the
length
but
not
the
type
of
the
sentence.
indeed,
congress
used
exactly
that
same
formulation
in
section
3583(g),
because
there
the
congress...
the
term
of
imprisonment
to
be
imposed
depends
on,
and
is
based
on
one-third
of
the
term
of
supervised
release,
but
we
know
from
the
context
that
congress
didn't
mean
a
new
term
of
supervised
release
that's
one
third
as
long
as
the
old
term,
even
though
it
used
the
same
structure.
it
meant,
in
prison,
and
it
made
that
very
clear
in
section
3583(g).
we
think
it's
equally
clear
here
in
context,
because
when
congress
said,
sentence
the
defendant,
congress
had
already
said,
revoke
probation,
so
we
know
probation
is
not
an
option.
therefore,
by
saying,
sentence
the
defendant
to
not
less
than
one-third
of
the
original
sentence,
congress
had
to
be
saying,
sentence
the
defendant
to
prison,
and
the
only
question
is
how
long,
and
that
is
answered
by
the
phrase,
not
less
than
one-third--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--because
original
sentence
doesn't
mean,
sentence
that
was
available
but
not
imposed.
original
sentence
has
only
one
possible
meaning
as
the
words
are
used
in
the
english
language.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
and
that's
precisely
our
point.
the
original
sentence
was
a
sentence
of
probation.
therefore,
original
sentence
means
the
sentence
of
probation
that
was
imposed
in
this
case,
but
one-third
of
the
original
sentence
doesn't
necessarily
mean
20
months
of
probation.
just
as
in
the
supervised
release
provision,
where
one-third
of
the
term
of
release
doesn't
mean
a
new
sentence
of
supervised
release,
here
one-third
of
the
original
sentence
doesn't
mean
a
new
sentence
of
probation,
it
means--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
because
it
was
unnecessary,
because
when
congress
says,
"sentence",
at
the
point
in
the
statute
where
congress
is
now
directing
the
court
to
sentence
the
defendant,
probation
is
no
longer
an
option,
because
congress
has
already
directed
the
court
to
revoke
probation,
and
the
phrase,
"revoke
the
sentence
of
probation"
means
in
federal
sentencing
law,
probation
is
not
an
option.
something
else
has
to
be
imposed
instead.
the
only
something
else
that
there
is
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
part
of
the
statute
that
mandates
a
new
sentence
is
imprisonment.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it's
inherent
in
the
very
doctrine...
section
35--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes.
every
case
that
construes
section
3565(a)(2),
which
talks
about
revocation
of
probation,
says
that
the
court
has
to
impose
some
other
sentence
from
within
the
guidelines
range,
but
probation
is
not
an
option.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
fact
that
congress
has
always
used
revoked
to
mean
exactly
that
i
think
commands
the
result
that
we
urge.
