well,
i
should
think
that
you
can
argue,
at
least
from
a
semantic
standpoint,
that
if
you
revoke
the
first
sentence
of
probation,
and
then
impose
a
new
sentence
of
probation
with
much
more
onerous
conditions,
you
have
to
report
for
drug
treatment
et
cetera
et
cetera,
that
that
is
a
different
sentence
of
probation
and
it's
still
a
sentence
that's
available
to
the
judge
under
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
that's...
that's
the
argument,
it
seems
to
me.
you
can
argue
that
it's
the
imposition
of
a
new
sentence
of
probation
with
new
conditions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i'm
still
not
clear
on
your
answer
to
justice
scalia.
he
points
out,
it
seems
to
me
correctly,
that
you
are
in
basic
agreement
with
the
government,
so
far
as
your
submission
so
far,
that
your
client
must
receive
a
term
of
incarceration--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
argue
that
one-third
of
the
original
sentence
means
one-third,
as
a
minimum,
of
the
original
probation
sentence,
a
probation
sentence
with
maybe
more
onerous
condition,
but
you
seem
to
back
away
from
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
statute
you
refer
to
explicitly
says
that
the
effective
date
of
this
statute
will
be
with
reference
to
those
persons
whose
sentence
of
probation
was
after
the
effective
date?
