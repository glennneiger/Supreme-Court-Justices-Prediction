if
that's
the
case,
then
you're
arguing
for
a
sentence
of
probation
all
over
again,
only
one-third
of...
with
a
one-third
minimum
of
the
original.
i
mean,
if
plain
meaning
is
good,
you've
got
to
take
plain
meaning
all
the
way.

mr.
smith,
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
something,
because
i
was
never
a
federal
sentencing
judge.
in
the
case
that
you
were
just
talking
about,
which
the
execution
is
suspended--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
probation
is
violated,
the
judge
under
the
prior
law
had
complete
discretion
to
determine
how
much
of
the
execution
would
then
be
imposed,
isn't
that
true,
so
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
make
your
basic
lenity
determination
based
upon
the
standard
case,
the
nonextraordinary
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
would
be
this
one
rather
than
the
d.c.
circuit
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
the
rule
of
lenity,
that's
just
reading
the
statute.
that's
the
rule
of
least
absurdity.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
once
we've
applied
the
rule
of
least
absurdity,
then
we
may
be
in
a
position
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenity.
