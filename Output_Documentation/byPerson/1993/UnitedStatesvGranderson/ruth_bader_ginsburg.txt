justice
ruth
bader

probation
would
not
have
been
a
sentence
prior
to
the
'84
reform--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
your
view
of
the
interpretation
of
this
language,
then,
not
less
than
one-third
of
the
original
sentence,
what
is
the
maximum
to
which
the
defendant
could
have
been...
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
have
been
imposed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is,
in
this
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
don't
follow
that.
if
one-third
of
the
original
sentence
is
20
months--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wouldn't
the
full
sentence
be
5
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
can
20
months
be
one-third
and
60
months
not
be
the
full
original
sentence?
we're
talking
about
what
this
defendant's
exposure
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--under
your
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hungar,
if
this
man
had
been
separately
prosecuted
for
the
conduct
that
led
to
the
revocation
of
his
probation
what
would
have
been
his
maximum
exposure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
did
you...
you
pointed
to
an
absurdity
in
your
response
to
justice
stevens,
isn't
there
something
anomalous
about
saying
if...
if
you
had
an
independent
prosecution,
the
maximum
exposure
would
be
twelve
months,
and
yet
without
a
separate
prosecution
that
person
can
be
incarcerated
for
twenty
months.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
maximum
that
the
judge
could
have
sentenced
him
under
the
guidelines
was
what?
instead
of
the
probation,
it
would
have
been
what?
six
months?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
think
the
judge
is
obliged
to
give
a
minimum
of
twenty
months?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
before
you
go
on
with
that,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
on
your
view,
if
there
must
be
incarceration,
then
the
top
would
be
6
months,
and
the
minimum,
not
less
than
one-third,
would
be
2
months,
is
that
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
interpretation
of
not
less
than
one-third
of
the
original
sentence
would
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you
disagree
with
the
government
that
that
would
not
have
fit
this
statute
because
prior
to
this
change
probation
was
not
considered
a
sentence
of
any
kind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
it
wasn't
treated...
i
mean,
you
didn't
convert
probation
time
into
jail
time
because
probation
was
not
considered
a
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
fit
the
words,
a
sentence,
until
the
change
in
the
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
your
reading,
could
the
judge
say,
originally
the
guidelines
gave
me
zero
to
6
months,
but
i
could
have
gone
up
to
5
years
if
i
wrote
an
opinion
saying
why
i
was
going
outside
the
guidelines.
now
i'm
ready
to
do
that.
would
that
be
within
the
range
on
your
interpretation?
i
asked
you
before...
i
think
you
said
that
the
range
would
be
2
months
minimum,
6
months
maximum.
could
the
judge
at
this
stage
say,
i'm
going
to
go
back
to
the
sentencing
authority
i
had
originally,
sentence
him
to
the
5
years,
and
i'll
write
an
opinion
explaining
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
any
necessary
part
of
your
case
to
talk
about
the
difference
between
individualized
sentencing
and
guideline
sentencing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
an
extraordinary
case
with
a
downward
departure.
where
the
sentence
is
within
the
guideline
range,
then
overwhelmingly
your
interpretation
is
going
to
incarcerate
the
defendant
for
a
considerably
longer
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
true
that
supervised
release
terms,
in
terms
of
number
of
months
or
years,
tends
to
be
shorter
than
sentences
of
probation,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
it
just
as
logical,
then,
if
you...
to
go
back
to
the
only
reference
you
have
for
incarceration,
which
is
the
originally
available
sentence
of
incarceration?
you
won't
allow
for
probation
to
get
to
a
sentence
of
incarceration.
you
have
to
drop
something
on
your
interpretation,
and
on
the
other
interpretation
you
take
the
only
incarceration
sentence
that's
possible,
the
sentence
that
was
open
to
the
judge
originally.
i
don't
see
why
that's
not
an
equally
permissible
interpretation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
know
it
cannot
mean
original
sentence,
because
here
the
original
sentence
was
one
of
probation.
