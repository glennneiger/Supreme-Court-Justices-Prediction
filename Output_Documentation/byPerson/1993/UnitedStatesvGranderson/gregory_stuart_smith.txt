mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
congress
has
not
unambiguously
said
it
wants
to
fundamentally
change
the
nature
of
federal
probation
revocations.
there
are
four
reasons
why
judge
phyllis
kravitch's
decision
should
be
affirmed.
first,
the
history
of
federal
probation
revocations.
second,
the
language
of
the
statute.
third,
the
disparities
caused
by
the
government's
interpretation
and
finally
the
legislative
history.
first,
history.
the
government's
brief
is
sparse
on
history
and
the
reason
is
exactly
why
justice
o'connor
asked
the
question.
historically,
revocation
terms
have
never
been
based
on
the
probation
terms.
they
have
never
been
convertible.
before
1984
you
had
a
sentence
that
was
suspended,
plus
probation.
after
1984,
you
had
the
guideline
term
imposed,
plus
probation.
before
1984,
you
went
back
to
the
sentence
to
impose...
the
sentence
that
was
suspended.
after
1984,
you
go
back
to
the
guideline
range.
probation
terms
have
never
been
used
as
the
barometer,
ever.
federal
courts
form
the
probation
term.
the
government
has
never--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--i
did,
your
honor,
i
apologize.
for
probation
terms
have
never
been
convertible
into
revocation
terms.
you've
always
looked
back
to
the
sentence
that
was
suspended
before
the
'84
act
or
after
the
'84
act,
you
look
back
to
the
guideline
range.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
your
honor,
i'm
talking
about
the
revocation
sentence.
revocation
sentence
has
never
been
based
on
the
probation
terms.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
the
sentence
imposed
upon
revocation,
your
honor.
when
somebody's
probation
is
revoked,
the
sentence
imposed
after
revocation
has
never
been
based
on
the
probation
terms.
they've
always
used
something
different,
and
there's
a
reason
for
that.
probation
terms
are
based
on
something
very
different:
rehabilitation.
probation
terms
are
based
on
things
like
how
long
it
takes
to
pay
a
fine
back,
or
how
long
it
takes
to
do
community
service.
it's
not
intended
to
be
converted,
and
it
never
has
been
converted,
into
revocation
sentences.
the
government,
from
this
tapestry
of
history,
long
history,
is
asking
you
to
take
two
snippets.
the
1984
acts
discuss
probation
as
a
sentence
and
the
1988
acts
reference
to
original
sentence,
and
they
ask
you
to
view
those
two
things
in
isolation,
ignoring
all
of
history.
they
want
you
to
turn
probation
into
pro-ration.
well
it's
never
been
done
that
way,
and
this
court
should
not
assume
that
congress,
without
any
warning
and
without
any
discussion,
intended
through
these
minor
statutory
changes
to
fundamentally
change
the
way
that
probation
works.
the
language
of
the
statute
confirms
that
there
is
not
an
unambiguous
statement
by
congress
that
they
intend
to
change
this.
the
government
tries
to
give
you
the
impression
that
they
are
using
the
sentence
imposed.
but
the
sentence
imposed
on
mr.
granderson
was
60
months
of
probation
plus
a
$2000
fine.
as
justice
souter
said,
taking
that
literally
one
third
of
the
original
sentence,
as
the
government
tries
to
infer,
is
20
months
of
probation
plus
a
$677
fine.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
your
honor,
we
submit
it
is
the
equivalent
of
what
the
old
original
sentence
would
have
been
under
old
law.
justice
o'connor
noted
that
the
way...
it
would
be
very
clear
under
the
old
system.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
it
would
be
the
top
of
the
range,
which
would
be
the
top.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
needs
to
answer
whether
it's
the
top
or
the
bottom.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
all
right.
yes,
your
honor.
i
apologize
if
i
misspoke.
i
think
to
the
top
of
the
range
is
the
most
logical
understanding
of
what
congress
meant.
this
is
not
a
plainly
written
statute.
the
top
of
the
range
yields
a
minimum
in
every
case
and
i
think
that
it
is
the
most
logical
conclusion.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
your
honor,
while
it's
true
that,
in
form,
probation
is
treated
as
a
sentence...
it's
called
a
sentence
under
the
new
statute,
it
is
not
treated
as
a
sentence
in
every
respect.
a
person
who...
person
who's
on
probation
and
then
has
it
revoked
doesn't
get
credit
for
the
time
served
on
probation
as
if
it's
service
of
a
sentence.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor.
but
they
didn't
use
the
word
sentence
of
probation
here.
they
used
original
sentence.
they
could
have
used
sentence
of
probation.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor.
it
also
could
refer
to
the
sentencing
guideline
range.
if
you
want
to
view
it
technically,
section
3742
refers
to
sentence--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
so,
viewed
in
its
historical
context.
this
court
would
have
to
find
that
this
technical
change
was
meant
to
fundamentally
alter
the
way
probation
revocations
work,
and
i
think
that
that
is
what
is
the
real
stretch
here.
it's
like
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
infer
from
discussions...
minor
discussions,
no
discussions
in
the
legislative
history.
i
indicated
to
the
solicitor
general
i
would
mention
this
case,
and
it's
the
dewsnup
case.
it's
a...
dewsnup
v.
tim,
and
in
that
case,
it's
a
bankruptcy
case,
but
the
court
found
that
pre-code
law
should
not
be
assumed
to
be
fundamentally
changed
without
at
least
something
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor,
you
do
have
to
do
that,
but
what
is
different
from
history,
fundamentally
different,
is
you've
never
based
the
amount
of
revocation
time
on
the
probation
term,
because
probation
serves
a
very
different
purpose.
that's
the
fundamental
change.
it's
never
been
done
that
way,
and
it
yields--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--very
strange
results.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
the
literal
interpretation.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor.
you
want
to...
you
want
to
know
what
i
really
think
happened?
in
october
of
1988,
there
had
been
almost
no
guidelines
revocations.
even
though
it
was
passed
in
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984,
it
didn't
go
into
effect
until
november
1st
of
'87,
for
crimes
that
were
committed
after
then.
for
somebody
to
have
gotten
to
the
revocation
stage,
they
would
have
had
to
commit
a
crime
after
november
1st
of
'87,
been
arrested,
been
convicted,
have
he
presentence
report
prepared,
be
sentenced,
and
sentenced
under
the
guidelines,
which
there
was
a
big
dispute
before
mistretta
whether
the
guidelines
were
even
constitutional,
then
go
out
and
be
revoked
and
again
be
arrested
and
sentenced
for
revocation,
all
before
october
of
'88,
less
than
10
months
after
the
guidelines
went
into
effect.
it
is
likely,
if
you
really
want
to
know
what
i
think,
that
congress
was
thinking
about
the
old
system
when
they
did
this,
and
it
is
not
clear
that
this
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
no,
your--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--your
honor,
if
i
did,
i
apologize.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
this.
i
think
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
cert
petition
issue,
did
the
lower
court...
did
the
court
of
appeals
err
in
finding
that
it
could
not
be
more
than
the
top
of
the
guideline
range,
the
original
sentence
could
not
be
more
than
the
top
of
the
guideline
range,
and
i
think
this
court
can
easily
answer
that,
whether
following
justice
scalia's
interpretation
or
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below,
that
it
does
not.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
your
honor,
i
think
they
followed
it
particularly
in
its
historical
context
as
closely
as
it
could
be
followed.
the
guideline
range
replaced
the
old
suspended
sentences,
in
our
view,
and
that's
what
they
tried
to
go
back
to
as
the
barometer.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
they
did
not,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
for
this
reason.
there
are
additional
conditions
that
could
be
placed
on
the
probation,
and
while
it
may
seem
odd
to
put
somebody
back
on
straight
probation
when
the
probation
has
a
condition
of
inpatient
drug
treatment,
it
doesn't
seem
quite
the
same
sentence.
the
disparities
created
by
the
government's
interpretation
are
weird,
to
say
the
least.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
it's
interesting,
the
government
below
in
its
plea
agreement
agreed
not
to
recommend
a
sentence
above
the
original
6-month
range,
so
it's
clear
that
mr.
granderson
would
not
have
gotten
more
than
6
months,
unless
the
judge
disagreed
with
the
government
on
what
was
the--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--two
months
of
some
kind
of
confinement.
the
disparities
by
the
government,
however,
are
very
strange.
a
person
who's
a
misdemeanant,
who
gets
5
years
of
probation,
the
government
would
have
that
person
get
20
months
in
jail,
more
than
the
statutory
maximum
for
the
underlying
offense.
it
would
cause
mr.
granderson
to
get
a
higher
minimum
sentence
of
20
months
than
his
revocation
range
under
the
revocation
guidelines
would
have
been
if
he
distributed
or
manufactured
drugs
while
on
probation.
it
would
cause
him
to
get
a
minimum
that
is
more
than
40
times
what
he
would
get
if
he
were
convicted
as
a
repeat
drug
possessor...
convicted
a
second
time
as
a
repeat
drug
possessor.
it
would
even
cause
him
to
get
more
than
if
he
possessed...
the
drug
that
he
possessed
in
his
system
in
jail,
if
he'd
had
the
audacity
to
bring
it
in
to
jail,
his
maximum
would
have
been
1
year.
the
government
submits
that
it's
more
than
that.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
it
certainly
is
in
the
case
of
my
client,
and
we
submit
it
will
always
be.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
we
don't
believe
so,
no.
the
government's
situation
also
pretends
further
problems
down
the
road.
if
this
person
who
is
a
misdemeanant
gets
20
months
after
the
revocation,
and
then
possesses
a
gun,
is
that
person
a
felon
in
possession?
these
are
problems
this
court
need
not
create.
our
recommendation,
and
the
one
from
the
court
of
appeals
below,
has
no
such
problems.
the
government...
and
all
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
adopted
it
indicates
no
problems,
and
if
you
turn
to
the
legislative
history,
you
see
why.
if
the
government
had
intended...
if
the
congress,
excuse
me,
had
intended
this
fundamental
change,
don't
you
think
there
would
be
something
in
the
legislative
history...
something,
if
they
wanted
to
start
using
probation
terms
as
the
barometer?
there's
nothing.
in
the
dewsnup
case,
you
would
think,
based
on
that,
that
that
would
be
required.
more
importantly--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--no,
your
honor,
not
specifically,
but
i
think
frankly
it
ought
to
be
more
easily
applied
in
a
criminal
context
because
the
rule
of
lenity
applies
in
a
criminal
context
and
would
not
in
a
bankruptcy
context.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that's
how
we
read
dewsnup.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
justice
scalia,
i
know
you
dissented
from
dewsnup
and
don't
necessarily
agree
with
that
principle,
and
i
think
it's
an
issue
that--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--no,
your
honor,
perhaps
i'm
stating
it
too
broadly.
i
think
what
this
court
said
is,
it
would
not
assume
a
fundamental
change
absent
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history,
it
would
not
assume
that,
and
i
think
it
shouldn't
assume
it
here.
if
congress
made
the
change
we
suggest--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--that's
most
of
the
cases
that
were
coming
before
cases
in
1988,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
the
suspended
sentence.
you
never
use
the
probation
term
as
the
barometer,
never.
it's
not
done.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
your
honor,
it's
called
a
sentence
in
1984,
but
it's
not
treated
as
a
sentence
in
every
respect.
as
i
indicated,
you
don't
get
credit
for
time--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
even
after
the
change
in
the
law...
after
1984,
when
probation
was
called
a
sentence,
you
still
didn't
use
the
probation
terms.
you
go
back
to
any
sentence
that
was
available
under
subchapter
(a)
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
which
means
you
go
back
to
the
revocation
range.
every
court
of
appeals
to
interpret
that
has
said
that
that
meant
the
original
guideline
range,
so
you
still
didn't
use
the
probation
term
even
after
probation
was
called
a
sentence.
probation
was
called
a
sentence
to
make
it
more
understandable
to
citizens.
they
didn't
understand
the
suspended
sentence
part,
and
congress
wanted
to
do
away
with
those
formalities
in
the
1984
act
that
were
confusing,
and
they
also
may
have
wanted
to
make
it
easier
to
make
statutes,
certain
crimes
not
eligible
for
probation.
there
used
to
be
a
split
in
this
court
about
whether
that
meant,
if
you
just
simply
say
no
probation,
does
that
also
outlaw
suspended
sentences,
and
they
wanted
to
do
away
with
all
that
gobbledygook,
but
it
didn't
change
the
way
probation
worked.
even
after
1984,
you
still
didn't
use
the
probation
term,
which
is
based
on
how
long
it
takes
to
pay
a
fine,
those
sorts
of
questions,
into
revocation
sentences.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
my
understanding
is
that
the
parameters
were
set
by
the
suspended
sentence.
i
don't
think--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--no,
your
honor,
the
court
could
suspend
imposition
of
the
sentence,
for
example,
and
there
would
be
no
sentence
to
put
in
its
place,
so
i
think
the
court
still
retained
discretion,
but
there
was
something
over
their
head,
just
like
there's
a
guideline
range
over
a
defendant's
head
now.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor.
even
in
that
context,
though,
looking
at
this
case,
the
judge
under
the
guidelines
wouldn't
have
given
more
than
6
months.
it's
as
if
he
imposed
a
sentence
of
6
months
and
suspended
it.
the
guidelines
suggest
that
a
sentence
of
more
than
6
months
wasn't
warranted,
and
the
government's
agreement
in
the
plea
agreement
suggests
that
a
sentence
beyond
6
months
wasn't
warranted,
so
looking
even
at
the
imposition...
excuse
me,
execution
suspended,
it's
still...
the
sentence
that
would
have
been
imposed
would
not
have
been
more
than
6
months.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
mr.
granderson
was
placed
on
probation
for
5
years
plus
a
$2,000
fine,
and
that
doesn't
fit
either
side's
description.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
the
way
we
see
it,
where
a
floor
is
being
placed
within
the
existing
framework
of
zero
to
6
months,
that
is
a
minor
technical
change,
the
kind
you
would
not
expect
there
to
be
a
lot
of
legislative
history
on,
and
so
it's
not
surprising
that
there's
not
here.
more
importantly,
since
the
briefs
have
been
filed,
i
indicate
that
senator
thurmond
introduced
a
bill
to
change
this,
and
he
did
so
because
congress
recognized,
or
at
least
he
told
congress,
that
there
was
ambiguity
in
that
statute.
it's
interesting
that
that
is
now
part
of
the
omnibus
senate
crime
bill.
senate
bill
1607
states
that
if
a
person
possesses
drugs
while
on
probation,
the
court
shall...
this
is
what
it
says:
"the
court
shall
revoke
the
sentence
of
probation
and
resentence
the
defendant
under
subchapter
(a)
to
a
sentence
that
interns
a
term
of
imprisonment.
"
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
legislative
history.
senator
thurmond's--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
senator
thurmond's
reason
for
introducing
it
was
that
there
was
ambiguity
in
the
statute.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor,
this
has
limited
impact,
but
all
i'm
trying
to
tell
the
court
is
that
if
this
court
finds
ambiguity,
it
would
be
telling
congress
nothing
more
than
it's
already
been
told.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
by
a
superior
source,
indeed,
your
honor.
[laughter]
all
i'm
saying
is,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
surprise
to
congress
to
learn
that
they
had...
as
justice
blackmun
said,
that
this
is
not
a
particularly
well-drafted
statute.
i
think
when
the
government's
suggestion
would
lead
to
fundamental
and
dramatic
changes,
this
court
should
require
real
clarity.
when
the
government's
suggestion
would
lead
to
these
kind
of
disparities
and
potential
constitutional
concerns,
this
court
should
require
real
clarity.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor,
if
the
facts
warranted
it,
they
could
depart
as
they
normally
depart,
but
we
would
have
a
right
to
appeal
that
departure
as
being
above
the
range.
the
government
takes
that
opportunity
away
from
it
and
creates
disparities
as
result.
but
that's
an
interesting
point
because
it
raises
this
hypothetical.
if
a
person
is
a
misdemeanant,
and
gets
5
years
of
probation,
and
that
person
commits
murder
while
on
probation,
the
statute
would...
congress
would
take
that
person
back
to
the
zero
to
6-month
range,
and
that's
where
they're
presumptively
supposed
to
be
sentenced
upon
revocation,
within
zero
to
6
months.
even
if
the
court
departed,
it
could
go
only
to
12
months,
the
statutory
maximum.
the
government's
position
would
cause
a
person
who
simply
possesses
drugs...
not
that
that's
not
a
serious
offense,
but
possesses
drugs,
to
get
20
months,
8
months
more
than
somebody
who
commits
murder
in
that
context.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
they
have
the
opportunity
to
prosecute
for
possession
of
drugs
as
well.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
no,
your
honor.
their
interpretation
yields
20
months
for
possession
of
drugs,
whereas
we
submit
that
the
range
of
zero
to
6
months
is
what
ought
to
apply.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
your
honor,
i
think
upon
any
revocation
you
can
depart
if
departure
is
warranted,
even
with
drug
possession.
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is,
the
government's
situation
in
a
misdemeanor
context
would
cause
somebody
who
murders
while
they're
on
a
misdemeanor
probation
to
potentially
get
less
than
a
person
who
possesses
drugs
while
on
probation.
this
court
should
require
real
clarity
not
only
when
there's
a
fundamental
and
dramatic
change
that
they're
suggesting,
not
only
when
there
are
disparities
created,
as
the
government
suggests,
but
when
you're
taking
away
a
judge's
right,
an
ability
to
do
justice,
justice
as
he
sees
fit,
individualized
sentencing
is
best
unless
congress
restricts
it.
here,
no
one...
no
one
below,
no
one
here--
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
--your
honor,
there
are
limits
that
congress
has
placed
on
it,
but
they've
never
taken
away
individualized
sentencing.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
your
honor,
i
guess
it's
because
i
just
don't
think
that
judges
are...
i
mean,
why
do
we
have
judges?
they'd
be
simply
robots
if
they're
simply
doing
what
congress
says
has
to
be
done
and
congress
is
doing
all
the
sentencing.
i
think
we
have
judges
because
we
want
justice
to
be
tempered
with
mercy.
mr.
gregory
stuart
smith
no,
your
honor.
the
only
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
no
one
below
and
no
one
here
argues
that
mr.
granderson
needs
9
more
months
of
jail
from
today.
no
one
says
that's
the
just
result,
and
i
recognize
that
if
congress
states
clearly
that
that's
not
what
should
happen,
this
court
has
to
follow
it,
but
congress
hasn't
stated
so
clearly
here.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
from
the
court,
i
have
nothing
further
to
say.
