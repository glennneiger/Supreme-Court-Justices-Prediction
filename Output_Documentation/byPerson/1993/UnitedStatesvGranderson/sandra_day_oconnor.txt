mr.
hungar,
may
i
ask
you,
under
the
former
sentencing
scheme,
if
some...
defendant
were
placed
on
probation,
i
assume
the
court
would
have
gone
through
the
mechanics
of
saying
"the
defendant
is
sentenced
to
x@l
amount
of
time
in
prison."
and
then
saying
"but
i
suspend
that
term
of
imprisonment
and
place
you
on
probation.
"
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
under
the
previous
version
of
the
statute,
18
u.s.c.
3651
in
the
1982
version
of
title
eighteen
[=
18]
and
also
under
i
think
previous
versions
of
the
probationary
sentencing
scheme,
the
court
had
an
option.
it
could
either
impose
a
sentence
and
then
excuse
the
execution
of
the
sentence,
which
is
the
option
you
identified,
or
it
could
suspend
sentencing...
suspend
the
imposition
of
a
sentence,
assuming
the
defendant
complied
with
the
conditions
of
probation.
and
what
was
normally
done,
do
you
suppose?
i
mean,
in
times
when
i
used
to
participate
in
sentencing
the
typical
thing
was
to
impose
the
sentence
and
then
suspend
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
that
were
the
practice
then
the
language
of
the
statute
makes
perfect
sense,
because
the
original
sentence
would
refer
to
the
sentence
that
was
suspended.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
make
it
quite
understandable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
know
how
this
language
got
in
here,
but
it's
a
little
hard
to
figure
it
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
this
language
the
original
sentence
language
put
in
there
originally
when
that
was
the
old
sentencing
scheme
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
that
the
language
of
the
statute
now
does
clearly
refer
to
a
sentence
of
probation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
sentence
of
probation
given
here
was
five
years
probation.
i
guess
that's
the
basis
of
the
argument
of
the
government
here.
and
so
you
can
read
the
statute
as
the
government
does,
to
say
he
was
given
a
five
year
sentence
of
probation
initially.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
perhaps,
although
we
have
to
do
the
best
we
can
in
interpreting
this,
and
it
is
clear
that
3565
as
it's
currently
written
refers
to
a
sentence
of
probation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
original
sentence
could
logically
refer
to
the
original
sentence
of
probation,
could
it
not?
i
mean--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
but
that
would
be
more
of
a
stretch
than
it
would
to
say
it
refers
to
the
sentence
of
probation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
a
fundamental
change
in
revocation.
i
mean,
it's
always
been
the
case
that
if
someone
is
convicted
and
sentenced
to
probation,
that
if
the
terms
of
the
probation
are
violated,
a
revocation
is
possible.
what
we're
looking
at
here
is
what
is
the
required
minimum
sentence
of
incarceration
in
the
event
of
a
violation
of
probation
that
involves
possession
of
a
controlled
substance.
i
don't
think
that's
a
fundamental
change.
you
still
have
to
go
through
the
mechanics
of
revoking
probation
and
then
figure
out
what
the
mandatory
minimum
incarceration
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
in
fact,
mr.
smith,
the
whole
statutory
scheme
here
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
clear
that
you
can't
reinstate
someone
on
probation
after
they
had
a
controlled
substance
possession
established.
i
mean,
that
just
seems
to
be
the
clear
import
of
the
language.
