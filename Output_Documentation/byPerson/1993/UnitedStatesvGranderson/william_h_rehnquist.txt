chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
92-1662,
united
states
against
granderson.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
probation
terms
have
never
been
used
as
the
barometer
for
probation
terms.
you
must
have
misspoke.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
a
revocation
term?
that's
not
term
that's
ever
used
in
the
statute
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
is
a
revocation
sentence?
i
mean,
again,
the
statute
doesn't
use
that
term.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
argument
as
to
what
the
term
original
sentence
means?
so
the
eleventh
circuit
seemed
to
take
the
view
that
the
original
sentence
was
not
a
determinant
thing
at
all,
but
a
range,
which
i
find
very
difficult
to
follow,
when
you're
referring
to
the
original
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
would
it
be
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
the
top
of
the
range
rather
than
the
bottom
of
the
range?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
ask
you
that
question
and
you
need
to
answer
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.--
--well,
we
have
to
answer
it
with
some
sort
of
reasoned
opinion,
not
just
kind
of
a...
the
least
common
denominator
type
of...
what
did
the
eleventh
circuit
say
about...
do
you
think
it
followed
the
statute
literally?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
certainly
didn't
say,
did
they,
that
the
only
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
was
probation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
dewsnup
dealt
with
the
principle
we've
enacted
in
connection
with
the
bankruptcy
code
in
1978,
that
absent
some
showing
to
the
contrary
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
statutory
language,
we
would
presume
that
the
old
bankruptcy
act,
the
principles
carried
over,
but
we've
never
had...
enunciated
any
such
general
principle
in
connection
with
the
entire
body
of
criminal
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
sentence
in
fact
imposed
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
final
decision
whether
there's
ambiguity
in
the
statute
is
committed
to
the
courts,
not
to
senators,
or
individual
senators.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
by
a
superior
source.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
with
a
more
serious
crime
always
has
the
option
to
independently
prosecute
the
person
and
not
simply
to
resort
to
this
provision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--know
that
individualized
sentencing
is
best?
i
mean,
congress
provided
for
a
regime
of
individualized
sentencing
for
a
long
time.
it
abandoned
it
in
'84,
and
now
has
guidelines.
how
is
a
court
to
say
that
one
is
better
than
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
haven't
totally
taken
it
away,
but
why
should
a
court
say
that
more
judicial
discretion
is
better
than
less
judicial
discretion
in
sentencing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
hungar,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
7303(d)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
the
case
is
submitted.
