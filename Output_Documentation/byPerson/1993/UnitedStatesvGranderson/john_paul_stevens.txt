john
paul

mr.
hungar,
following
up
on
justice
souter's
question,
i
suppose
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
there
might
well
have
been
people
still
incarcerated
who
were
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
followed
by
a
term
of
probation,
and
supposing
someone
was
in
jail
on
a
15-year
sentence,
10
years
jail
imprisonment
plus
5
years
probation,
and
that
had
not
expired
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
and
that
person
had
his
probation
revoked
in
the
third
year
of
the
probation
period,
what
would
the
appropriate
sentence
be
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
true
now,
but
was
that
always
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
necessarily
true,
just
as
a
matter
of
pure
plain
meaning?
suppose
there
was
just
1
month
left
of
the
probationary...
say
it
was
on
9
years
probation.
at
the
end
of
the
probation
he's
caught
with
cocaine
in
his
system.
would
it
not
be
at
least
logically
possible
to
revoke
the
remainder
of
that
probationary
period
and
impose
a
new
sentence
of
3
years'
probation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
whatever
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
have
lost
your
chance
to
enjoy
the
particular
conditional
liberty
on
which
you
have
been
sentenced--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
has
another
30
days
to
run.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
says
more
than
that.
it
says
"revoke"
and
impose
any
other
sentence.
so
two
can
contemplate
something
other
than
probation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
proviso
doesn't
say
that.
it
refers
back
to
one
third
of
the
original
sentence
and
that
original
sentence
is
"probation".
justice
john
paul
stevens
unmodified
by
the
additional
language
in
sub-paragraph
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
do
think
"revoke"
has
all
that
baggage
with
it,
but
the
statutory
language
doesn't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
absurd
because
it
is
a
flaw
and
there
are
cases
in
which
it
would
make
sense.
you
either
impose
more
onerous
terms
of
probation
and
an
additional
period
of
time
says
only
one
month
left
to
serve.
that's
not
absurd.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
flawed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
going
back
to...
looking
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
were
there
people
in
federal
prisons
at
that
time
who
had
been
sentenced
under
the
regime
that
justice
o'connor
described
such
as
having
gotten
a
sentence
of
6
months...
or
a
sentence
of
6
months
in
jail
suspended,
and
in
lieu
thereof
probation
for
5
years,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
under
that
view,
what
would
you
have
interpreted
the
original
sentence
to
refer
to,
the
suspended
term
of
imprisonment,
or
the
probationary
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
there
are...
there
were...
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
there
was
a
prison
population
who
would
have
fit
the
description
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
used.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
were
eligible
for
having
their
probation
revoked
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
this
statute
would
have
made
a
change
in
that
prior
to
this
statute,
if
the
person
on
probation
were
found
in
possession
of
cocaine,
as
this
man
was,
the
judge
might
not
have
revoked
this
probation
at
all.
he
might
have
said,
well,
i'll
give
you
a
second
chance,
but
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
now
mandatory
that
probation
must
be
revoked
if
this
particular
reason
for
revoking
exists,
so
that
in
that
sense
it's
tougher,
even
though--
--well,
if
you're
dealing
with
the
world
of
earlier
sentencing
jargon,
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
is
based
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
judge
in
that
hypothetical
case
said
he
would
suspend
the
imposition
of
sentence,
but
as
i
recall
it
myself,
and
as
i
think
i
understand
the
discussion,
judges
also
under
that
regime
would
impose
a
sentence
but
suspend
serving
it.
in
other
words,
they
wouldn't
always
suspend
the
imposition
of
a
sentence,
and
it
seems
to
me
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
doesn't
fit
so
well
in
the
latter
situation,
where
there
are
sentences
imposed
but
its
service
is
suspended.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
the
statute
apply,
mr.
hungar,
to
a
person
who
4
years
earlier
had
been
given
a
suspended
sentence
of
6
months,
then
was
suspended
and
was
put
on
probation
for
5
years?
now,
that
would
not
be
a
sentence,
i
understand,
as
justice
ginsburg
has
pointed
out,
but
he's
on
probation
at
the
time,
and
then
that
person's
probation
was
revoked.
would
the
statute
apply
to
that
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
sentence...
if
the
person
on
probation
had
its
probation
revoked
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
that
person
would
not
have
had
any
mandatory
requirement.
i
mean,
the
statute
simply
wouldn't
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
cite
your
authority...
you've
said
it
several
times...
for
the
proposition
that
once
probation
is
revoked,
the
judge
does
not
have
the
authority
to
reinstate
probation
on
different
terms
and
conditions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
case
has
said
that,
that
you
know
of?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
all
think
this
statutory
language
commands
that,
and
forbids
a
different
sentence
of
probation
on
much
more
severe
terms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
have
no
authority
for
it.
