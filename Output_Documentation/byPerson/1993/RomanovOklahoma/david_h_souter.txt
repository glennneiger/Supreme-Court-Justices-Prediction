justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
peters,
may
i
interrupt
you
on
that
point?
as
i
understand,
your
position
is...
strike
that.
as
i
understand
your
reading
of
the
oklahoma,
it
is
that
they
found
there
was
error,
but
that
there
was
not
federal
constitutional
error,
is
that
correct?
in
other
words,
the
information
shouldn't
have
been
conveyed,
but
it
simply
was
not
a
due
process
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
but
you
also
view
their
opinion
as
not
engaging
in
harmless
error
analysis
in
the
strict
sense,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
eighth
amendment
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
crime
had
been
convicted
after
the
prior
sentence
had
been
imposed,
and
it
was
relevant
under
the
law
of,
say,
an
aggravating
factor,
or
what-not,
that
the
individual
had
committed
the
later
felony
following
receipt
of
a
sentence
of
death?
could
the
fact
of
the
sentence
be
introduced
under
those
circumstances?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
the
answer
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
assuming
that
they're
not
following
your
instructions,
and
your
whole
argument
assumes
that
they're
not
going
to
play
it
straight
when
the
judge
instructs
them
on
their
choices
and
the
basis
for
their
choices
in
the
case
before
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that...
isn't
that
exactly
what
you're
doing?
at
this
moment,
that's
what
you're
doing,
because
your
brief
says,
we
accept
that
the
information
was
irrelevant
and
further
that
it
could
diminish
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility,
but
there
were
all
these
other
instructions.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe
we
misunderstood.
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
was
that
a
legitimate
argument...
i.e.,
a
sound
argument
could
be
made
that
it
was
not
irrelevant,
and
wasn't
that
your
answer
to
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
it
would
have
been
a
sound
conclusion
if
they
had
so
found.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
doesn't
your
argument
for
the
soundness
of
that
conclusion
rest
on
the
assumption
that
the
jury
in
fact
will
not
follow
its
instructions
in
the
case
before
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
is
it
relevant
if
they
follow
the
instructions
in
the
case
before
them
that
another
jury
in
another
case
for
another
crime
sentenced
to
life
or
sentenced
to
death?
what's
that
got
to
do
with
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
they
need
to
know
anything
about
the
former
crime?
he's...
the
defendant
is
on
trial
for
this
crime,
not
that
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
under
what
criterion
of
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
oklahoma
define
one
criterion
for...
or,
strike
that.
does
oklahoma
provide
that
one
criterion
for
imposing
the
death
penalty
is
that
a
prior
death
penalty
has
been
imposed?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
just
don't
see
the
relevance
of
it
at
all.
i
assume
your
point
is
that
the
death
penalty
would
not
have
been
imposed
unless
it
was
a
particularly
serious,
heinous
kind
of
a
murder,
and
that
the
jury
who
knows
someone
has
not
only
committed
a
murder,
but
committed
a
murder
that
a
prior
jury
thought
was
so
horrible
that
it
should
be
punished
by
death,
that's
likely
to
have
been
a
worse
murder,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
if
you're
not
saying
that,
i
don't
know
what
you're
saying.
