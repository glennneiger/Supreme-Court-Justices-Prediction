justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about...
in
oklahoma,
the
jury
does
the
sentencing
even
in
noncapital
cases,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in...
when
the
prosecutor
in
the
sentencing
hearing
calls
the
attention
of
the
jury
to,
say
a
prior
armed
robbery
conviction,
is
it
the
practice
to
give
the
details
of
the
armed
robbery
conviction,
or
just
the
statutory
crime
and
the
fact
that
he
was
found
guilty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he's
not
permitted
to
go
into
the
gruesome
details
of
the
prior
one
to
show
this
was
really
a
serious
armed
robbery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
is
there
any
reason
why
there
should
be
a
different
rule
in
capital
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
the
state
permitted
to...
beyond
putting
in
the
death...
the
fact
that
he
was
sentenced
to
death,
is
it
permitted
to
put
in
all
the
details
of
the
prior
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
their
reasoning,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
there's
no
caldwell
error
unless
the
alleged
defect
in
the
proceedings
gave
the
jury
the
impression
that
someone
other
than
the
jury
would
be
doing
the
sentencing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
way
they
reasoned.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
fairly
narrow
reading
of
caldwell.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any...
do
you
have
any
cases
that
have
found
this
kind
of
evidence
relevant?
