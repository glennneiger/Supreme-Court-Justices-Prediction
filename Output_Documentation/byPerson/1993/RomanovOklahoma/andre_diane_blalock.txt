ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
in
deciding
this
case,
answered
the
questions
that
this
court
has
asked
us
to
discuss,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
there
was
any
eighth
or
fourteenth
amendment
violation
in
the
introduction
of
this
evidence.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
recognized
this
court's
holdings
in
caldwell,
recognized
the
standards
that
were
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
and
they
determined
that
there
was
none.
they
first
engaged
in
the--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
it
was
not
relevant,
that
it
was
irrelevant.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
no,
your
honor,
i
only...
my
only
disagreement
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decision
is
that
perhaps
it
erred
on
the
side
of
conservatism
in
analyzing
this
evidence.
i
think
that
other
states--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--no,
ma'am.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
yes,
he
had.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
the
state
is
always
entitled
to
prove
its
case,
regardless
of
the
defendant's
stipulations.
the
state
introduced,
as
is
common
practice,
the
judgment
and
sentence.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
the
prosecutor
did
not
know
at
that
time
that
it
was
irrelevant.
he
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decision,
and
it's
standard
procedure
when
proving
a
prior
conviction
in
oklahoma
in
a
capital
case
under
an
aggravating
circumstance,
or
under...
or
noncapital
felony
cases
that
are
enhanced
by
former
convictions.
prosecutors
prove
the
prior
convictions
by
introducing
the
judgment
and
sentence.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
i
believe
that
this...
the
fact
of
the
prior
sentence,
as
well
as
the
prior
conviction,
could
be
considered
relevant.
i
think
that--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--it
prevents
the
arbitrary
factor,
and
the
capriciousness
that
this
court
has
attempted
to
avoid
in
its
capital
cases.
for
example,
in
oklahoma
at
this
time
there
were
only
two
possible
punishments
for
first
degree
murder,
and
that
was
life
imprisonment,
or
a
death
sentence.
giving
the
jury
the
additional
piece
of
information
about
the
prior
sentence,
what
had
been
imposed
in
the
prior
first
degree
murder
conviction,
prevented
them
from
speculating
on
what
that
prior
sentence
was.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
i
don't
think
the...
i
think--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--i
think--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--i
think
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
could
have
properly
decided
it
was
relevant
evidence.
i
think
that
another
court
could
properly
decide
that
it
was
relevant
evidence
under
state
law,
and
satisfied
some
legitimate
state
interest.
i
think--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--to
prevent
the
jury's
speculation
about
what
the
prior
sentence
was
that
prevents
them
from
oversentencing
on
the
second
case,
thinking
perhaps
this
defendant
received
a
life
sentence
on
the
prior
first
degree
murder
conviction,
so
we
will
make
up
for
it.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
i
think
that's
exactly
what
petitioner
does,
is
assume
that
they're
not
following--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--i
do
accept
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
it
was
irrelevant,
and
i
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
i
just--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--i
believe
that
another
state
court
could
very
well
find
that
it
was
relevant
evidence,
and
i
believe
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
could
have
found
that
it
was
relevant
evidence.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
yes,
exactly.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
the
additional
piece--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--it
gives
them
an
additional
piece
of
evidence
about
what...
about
that
former
crime.
there's
no
question
that--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--absolutely,
and
were
we
talking
about
the
guilt
phase,
that
would
certainly
be
true,
but
in
the
sentencing
phase,
the
fact
of
the
prior
conviction
is
certainly
relevant
evidence.
that's
not
at
issue.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
in
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
capital
case...
here
there
were
alleged
two
aggravating
circumstances.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
no--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--absolutely
not.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
i'm
saying
that--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--in
the
second
case--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--it
can
give
the
jury
additional
evidence
about
the
fact
of
the
prior
crime,
that
it
was
a
particularly
horrible
crime.
we
all
know
that
first
degree
murders
are
not
all
the
same.
it
could
say
something
about
the
defendant's
character,
the
reason
for
the
death
sentence
was
imposed--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
in
a
noncapital
case,
the
only
thing
that's
relevant
is
the
fact
of
the
prior
conviction,
so
the
prosecutor
merely
introduces
the
judgment
and
sentence
showing
there
was
a
prior
conviction,
showing
it
was
final--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--not
in
a
noncapital
case.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
well,
yes,
because
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
that
this
evidence
was
used
to
prove...
there
were
two
different
ones,
and
one
was
that
there
was
a
probability
the
defendant
would
pose
a
continuing
threat
to
society.
in
order
to
prove
that,
the
state
has
to
go
behind
the
fact
of
the
mere
conviction
and
show
the
facts
of
the
crime.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
as
to
the
continuing
threat
aggravating
circumstance,
the
state
has
to
put
forth
that
evidence
about
the
prior
crime,
and
it
may
not
even
be
an
adjudicated
crime
under
oklahoma
law.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
the
fact
of
the
thompson
murder,
and
that
was
the
prior
conviction
and
sentence
that
we're
talking
about--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--there
was
also
an
aggravating
circumstance
of
prior
violent
felony
conviction.
in
order
to
prove
that,
the
state
had
to
introduce
the
judgment
and
sentence
showing--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--the
prior
conviction.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
in
the
second
stage
the
state
put
on--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--no,
ma'am,
that's
not
correct.
the
state
also
put
on
live
witnesses
who
testified
as
to
the
facts
of
the
thompson
murder,
and
that
was
to
show
the
continuing
threat
aggravating
circumstance.
that's
part
of
our
argument,
that
in
this
case,
this
additional
piece
of
accurate
evidence
could
not
have
possibly
influenced
the
jury's
verdict.
not
only
had
they
already
convicted
this
defendant
of
first
degree
murder--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--the
court
of
criminal
appeals
recognized
that
there
was
a
possibility,
or
at
least
the
issue
had
been
raised
that
this
was
a
caldwell-type
violation.
then
they
went
through
that
analysis
and
held
that
it
was
not
in
this
case.
they
also
held
that
the
introduction
of
this
evidence
did
not
infect
the
sentencing
procedure
so
as
to
constitute
a
due
process
violation,
therefore
engaging
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
analysis.
after
that,
they
held
that
this
piece
of
evidence
was
irrelevant
and
should
not
have
been
admitted
under
state
law.
they
then
considered
the
fact
of
the
admission
of
this
irrelevant
evidence
under
state
law
in
the
entire
context
of
the
proceedings,
and
held
that
it
could
not
have
possibly
affected
the
jury's
verdict.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
that's
all,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
the
judgment
and
sentence
was
not
redacted,
was
not
edited
to
delete
that
portion
that
reflected
what
the
defendant
had
received
on
the
prior
first
degree
murder
conviction.
that's
the
only
portion
of
the
evidence
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
found
was
irrelevant.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
it
did
not
find
that
there
was
constitutional
error,
and
what
the
petitioner
presupposes
is
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
engaged
in
the
wrong
standard
set
down
by
this
court
when
there's
federal
constitutional
error.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
ever
find
that.
they
didn't
find
that
there
was
a
federal
constitutional
error,
nor
did
they
find
that
there
was
a
state
constitutional
error,
they
just
found
that
the
admission
of
this
evidence
was
irrelevant,
and
then,
in
the
context
of
all
the
other
evidence
which
was
presented
in
the
sentencing
stage,
decided
whether
or
not
it
could
have
affected
the
jury's
verdict,
and
they
held
that
it
did
not.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
they
found
that,
when
viewed
in
the
entirety
of
the
evidence,
and
in
the
instructions
that
were
given
to
the
jury,
that
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
this
evidence
could
have
influenced
the
jury's
verdict.
we
quoted
in
our
brief...
there
are
two
different
analysis,
or
two
different--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--i
believe
in
that
context...
and
that
quotation
from
the
court
is
at
page
58
of
the
joint--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--appendix.
the
court
recognizes
that
capital
sentencing
procedures
and
capital
trials
require
greater
degree
of
scrutiny,
and
recognizes
this
court's
decision
in
california
v.
ramos.
they
then
go
into
their
analysis,
and
make
the
due
process
determination
whether
or
not
the
introduction
of
this
evidence
infected
the
sentencing
procedure
to
the
degree
that
it
was
unreliable
and
constituted
a
due
process
violation.
it
then
held
that
it
did
not.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
they
did
not
find
constitutional
error
and
then
engage
in
a
harmless
error
analysis
under
this
court's
decisions
of
what
standard
applies
in
constitutional
violations,
so
no,
they
didn't
do
that.
they
just
recognized
that
the
evidence
was
irrelevant,
and
determined
that
it
couldn't
have
affected
the
jury's
verdict.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
that
was--
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
--that
was
exactly
their
reasoning
as
to
the
eighth
amendment,
the
caldwell
violation.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
well,
in
this
case
i
believe
that
they
were
correct
in
holding
that
caldwell
didn't
apply.
the
jury...
no
one
ever
indicated
or
hinted
to
the
jury
that
they
were
not
the
final
decisionmakers
as
to
the
defendant's
death
sentence
in
this
case.
the
prosecutor
never
told
them
that,
the
trial
court
certainly
never
told
them
that,
in
fact
they
did
the
opposite.
the
jury
instructions
emphasized
to
the
jury
that
the
decision
was
up
to
them,
there
was
certainly
no
prosecutorial
misconduct
or
any
bad
faith
action
on
behalf
of
the
state
or
the
trial
court
in
seeking
to
undermine
the
jury's
responsibility
in
rendering
a
sentence
in
this
case.
although
i
believe
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
was
certainly
correct
in
their
analysis
under
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
held
that
this
was
not
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
going
back
to
my
earlier
point,
i
don't
think
that
they
had
to
determine
that
the
evidence
was
irrelevant,
i
think
that
they
could
have
determined
that
the
evidence
was
relevant.
i
think
that
another
state
could
find
under
their
evidentiary
rules
that
this
sort
of
evidence
was
relevant.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
the
ones
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
and
i
believe
there
is...
the
primary
one
is
out
of
pennsylvania.
most
of
the
cases
that
have
dealt
with
this
type
of
evidence
have
been
cases
in
which
the
jury
not
through
the
admission
of
evidence
but
through
the
newspapers,
the
media,
or
through
their
own
common
knowledge
had
some
knowledge
that
the
defendant
had
a
prior
death
sentence.
some
of
them
knew
that
the
defendant
had
a
prior
death
sentence
that
had
been
vacated
or
had
a
valid
outstanding
prior
death
sentence.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
yes,
i
would
think
so.
accepting
petitioner's
argument
at
face
value,
i
don't
think
i'm
stretching
petitioner's
argument
in
saying
that
any
time
a
juror
has
knowledge
defendant
has
a
prior
death
sentence,
then
a
fair
trial
is
not
possible
and
a
reversal
will
have
to
result.
ms.
andre'
diane
blalock
the
evidence
came
in
the...
the
knowledge
of
the
prior
death
sentence
came
in
the
form
of
evidence
in
the
judgment
and
sentence.
the
trial
court
didn't
refer
to
it
except
to
emphasize
to
the
jury
that
it
was
not
final
and
that
it
was
on
appeal.
pardon
me.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
then
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
to
this
court
our
position
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
was
correct
in
their
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
and
they
were
correct
in
their
analysis
of
the
effect
of
the
prior
death
sentence
in
the
context
of
this
case.
i
would
also
like
to
remind
you
that
in
this
particular
case,
i
realize
that
what
we're
primarily
concerned
with
is
setting
down
guidelines
or
determining
for
future
cases
what
the
effect
of
this
evidence
is,
or
if
this
evidence
should
be
admitted
at
all,
but
in
this
case,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
to
engage
in
a
reweighing
analysis
because
the
prior
violent
felony
conviction
aggravating
circumstance
fell.
they
then
considered,
as
this
court
has
held
that
they
may,
the
remaining
aggravating
circumstances,
and
considered
all
the
mitigating
evidence
that
was
presented
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
and
held
that
the
best
sentence
was
still
the
appropriate
sentence.
their
decision
is
on
page
66
of
the
joint
appendix.
so
certainly
in
this
case
there's
absolutely
no
question
that
that
judgment
and
sentence
that
reflected
that
the
defendant
already
had
a
death
sentence
could
have
affected
his
verdict,
could
have
affected
the
sentence
of
death
in
this
case
at
all,
based
on
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
to
do.
thank
you.
