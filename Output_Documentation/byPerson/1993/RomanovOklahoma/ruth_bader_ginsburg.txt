unless
the
state...
i
didn't
hear
that
last
remark.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
really
arguing
for
a
clear
position
that
the
jury
may
not
be
informed
of
an
outstanding
death
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
position
in
answer
to
my
question
was,
your
theory
is
it
will
give
the
jury
a
diminished
sense
of
responsibility
in
every
case
to
know
that
another
jury
has
already
returned
a
death
sentence,
and
that
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which
it
would
be
proper?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
that
affect
your
earlier
argument
that
a
jury
is
going
to
have
a
diminished
sense
of
responsibility?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
your
answer
different
in
response
to
justice
souter's
hypothetical?
what
difference
does
it
make
what
order
the
crimes...
the
order
in
which
the
crimes
were
committed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
thing
is
the
judgment
and
sentence--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
doesn't
tell
the
details
of
the
crime.
would
you
tell
us
what's
in
this
record
about
the
prior
conviction?
there's
the
conviction,
and
the
death
sentence,
and
what
else
was
this
jury
told
about
the
prior
murder?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
all
based
on
a
stipulation,
and
the
only
question
was
whether
the
judgment
that
showed
the
death
sentence
would
go
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
arguing
against
the
decision
that
you're
defending
again,
because
didn't
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
say,
this
could
diminish
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility.
it
said
two
things.
it
was
not
relevant...
the
imposition
of
a
death
penalty
by
another
jury
is
not
relevant,
and
it
said,
learning
the
defendant
had
previously
received
a
death
sentence
could
diminish
the
jury's
sense
of
the
importance
of
its
role.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
standard
that
the
court
applied
to
determine
that
though
there
was
error,
it
wasn't
fatal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
seemed
to
think
there
was
some
constitutional
component
to
what
it
was
doing,
because
it
said,
we
must
review
this
under
a
heightened
standard
because
the
qualitative
difference
of
death
from
all
other
punishments
requires
a
correspondingly
greater
degree
of
scrutiny,
so
i'm
not...
what
do
all
those
words
add
up
to?
heightened
standard,
greater
degree
of
scrutiny...
what
was
the
standard
that
the
oklahoma
criminal--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
this
heightened
standard,
was
that
a
harmless
error
standard,
and
i
believe
justice
o'connor
asked
you
that
question
earlier.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying--
--well,
that
makes
me--
--they're
not
relevant
but
they're
highly
prejudicial,
that's
what
you're--
