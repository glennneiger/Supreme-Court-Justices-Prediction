chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
92-9093,
joseph
romano
v.
oklahoma.
mrs.
peters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think,
mrs.
peters,
that
would
make
the
jury
in
this
case
more
likely
or
less
likely
to
itself
impose
the
death
sentence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
saying
that
the
jury
was
more
likely
to
convict
because
of
this
second...
you're
saying
it
might
have
been
more
likely
to
convict,
it
might
have
been
less
likely...
it
was
just
kind
of
an
aberrant
factor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
logical
to
say,
if,
as
you
say,
juries
shy
away
from
this
responsibility,
to
say
well,
he's
already
been
sentenced
to
death?
he's
going
to
be
executed
anyway,
we'll
just
give
him
life.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
or
cases
from
our
court
are
you
relying
on
for
your
submission,
ms.
peters?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
caldwell
requires,
though,
doesn't
it,
if
one
takes
the
concurring
opinion
which
made
the
court...
that
the
information
be
misleading
or
false?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
person
had
not
previously
been
sentenced
to
death?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
was
false
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
it
had
been
a
valid...
what
if
the
sentence
had
been
upheld
on
appeal,
would
you
still
be
making
the
same
arguments
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
really
converts
caldwell
into
something
that
a
majority
of
the
court
never
subscribed
to.
you're
saying
it's
not
limited
to
being
factually
misleading,
but
if
it
tends
to
diminish
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility.
i
don't
think
a
majority
of
the
court
subscribed
to
that
view.
this
evidence
i
believe
is
misleading
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
it
led
the
jury
to
view
its
role
in
a
way
that
was
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
eighth
amendment
but
also
because
of
language
in
the
offending
document
itself.
not
only
did
it
say
that
the
defendant
had
been
sentenced
to
die,
but
that
the
defendant
was
asked
in
open
court
if
he
could
state
good
cause
why
the
jury's
verdict
should
not
be
imposed,
that
he
could
not,
nor
could
the
court
find
any.
i
think
a
juror
could
have
read
this
language
to
be
a
concession
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
or
an
independent
determination
by
the
trial
judge
that
he
was
in
fact
deserving
of
death,
and
i
think
this
document--
--you
don't
challenge
the
factual
accuracy
of
that
transcript,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
did
it
purport
to
be
a
recitation
of
something
that
had
happened
at
the
sentencing
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
didn't
purport
to
be
a
recitation,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can't
a
jury
be
informed
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
of
a
prior
conviction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
saying
that
then
the
jury
could
have
been
informed
if
this
sentence
had
not...
had
been
upheld,
it
could
have
been
informed
that
he
had
been
convicted,
but
he
couldn't
have
been
informed
of
the
sentence
which
was
imposed
on
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
supports
that
proposition?
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
peters.
ms.
blalock...
mrs.
peters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
blalock,
what
exactly
was
it
that
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
was
irrelevant,
the
admission
of
the
sentence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blalock.
ms.
peters,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
peters.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
92-9093,
romano
against
oklahoma.
in
this
case
petitioner,
romano,
was
sentenced
to
death
by
an
oklahoma
trial
court.
during
the
sentencing
phase
of
his
trial,
the
state
introduced
evidence
indicating
that
he
had
already
received
the
death
sentence
in
the
course
of
an
earlier
trial
for
a
different
murder.
the
jury
in
the
present
case
ultimately
found
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweighed
the
mitigating
circumstances
and
sentenced
him
to
death.
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
affirmed
his
conviction
and
sentence.
we
granted
certiorari
and
the
petitioner
contends
here
that
the
evidence
of
his
earlier
death
sentence
admitted
in
this
trial
violated
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
admission
of
this
evidence
did
not
amount
to
constitutional
error.
the
evidence
of
his
earlier
death
sentence
did
not
affirmatively
mislead
the
jury
into
believing
that
the
responsibility
for
sentencing
him
into
this
case
lay
elsewhere
so
as
to
violate
the
principle
established
by
our
decision
in
caldwell.
and
even
though
the
evidence
may
have
been
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
state
law
does
not
make
its
admission
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
admission
of
the
evidence
finally
did
not
so
infect
the
trial
with
unfairness
as
to
render
the
jury's
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
a
denial
of
due
process.
so,
the
judgment
of
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
ginsburg
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
blackmun,
stevens,
and
souter
join.
