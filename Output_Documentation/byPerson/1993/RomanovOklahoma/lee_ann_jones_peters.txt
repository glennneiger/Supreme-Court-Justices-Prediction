ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
capital
case,
the
state
succeeded
in
introducing
evidence,
over
the
defendant's
objection,
that
the
defendant
had
already
been
sentenced
to
die
by
another
jury
in
an
unrelated
case.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
that
evidence
undermined
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility
in
violation
of
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
capital
juries
are
asked
to
decide
on
behalf
of
the
community
whether
a
defendant
should
live
or
die
at
the
hands
of
the
state.
this
is
a
most
agonizing
decision,
and
one
that
this
court
has
recognized
jurors
may
seek
to
avoid.
how
relieved
the
jurors
must
have
been
in
this
case
to
discover
that
the
decision
had
already
been
made,
that
the
community
had
already
decided
that
john
romano
should
die.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
i
think
that
it
would
make
it
more
likely.
i
think
that
there
is
a
possibility,
as
the
state
has
argued,
that
one
jury
may
give
life
because
it
felt
that
its
decision
did
not
matter,
a
man
can
only
be
killed
one
time.
if
a
jury...
if
one
jury
gives
life
because
of
the
factor
that
he's
already
been
sentenced
to
death,
and
other
juries
give
death
because
of
that
same
factor,
that
shows
how
arbitrary
factor
this
is.
that's
not
a--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--to
sentence
to
death,
i
think
it
was
more
likely
that
it
would
affect
its
judgment
to
sentence
him
to
death.
it
would
be
more
likely
to
do
what
the
other
jury
had
done.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
regardless
of
which
the
jury
is
likely
to
do,
it
is
not
a
principled
distinction...
principled
guiding
factor
to
determine
when
death
is
appropriate
in
a
case
and
when
it
is
not,
whether
the
jury
returned
life,
or
whether
the
jury
returned
death.
either
way,
it's
an
unreliable
verdict,
because
it
was
based
on
an
arbitrary
factor
rather
than
a
determination
that
death
was
appropriate
for
this
case.
although
the
jury
was
not
explicitly
told
in
this
case
that
their
decision
did
not
matter,
that
message
was
clearly
communicated
by
the
piece
of
evidence
that
showed
that
he
had
already
been
sentenced
to
die.
leading
the
jury
to
believe
that
its
decision
does
not
matter
falsely
deflates
the
solemnity
of
the
decision-making
process
and
reduces
the
proceeding
to
a
mere
formality
both
as
to
the
defendant's
eligibility
for
death
as
well
as
the
appropriateness
of
that
decision.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
it
is
not,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--certainly.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
that
is
correct.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
that
is
correct.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
recognized
that
it
might
have
undermined
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility,
but
then
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
it
did
so.
there
were
several
problems
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
analysis
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
they
relied
on
an
instruction
as
curing
this
evidence
that
was
not
in
fact
given.
they
said
that
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
was
not
to
surrender
its
judgment
to
any
item
of
evidence.
that
instruction
simply
is
not
in
the
record.
they
also
presumed
the
jury's
verdict
to
be
correct,
and
they
applied
the
wrong
standard.
they
said
that
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
it
affected
the
jury's
verdict,
that
it
was
highly
unlikely--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--i
think
that
the
court
looked
at
it
as
an
eighth
amendment
error
initially--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--and
said
that
it
might
undermine
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility,
and
then
analyzed
it
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
instead.
they
said
that
they
had
to
review
it
with
a
heightened
sense
of
scrutiny,
which
is,
of
course,
eighth
amendment
language,
and
then
they
said
that
it
did
not
deny
him
due
process,
which
is
fourth
amendment,
so
i'm
not
really
clear
what
it
was
the
court--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--that's
correct.
they
did
not
say
that
they
were
applying
a
harmless
error
analysis,
and
they
certainly
did
not
use
language
that
would
indicate
that
they
did.
they
said
that
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
it
affected
the
verdict.
highly
unlikely
does
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
it
did
affect
the
jury's
verdict.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
several
cases.
of
course,
all
the
cases
on
reliability
of
evidence
in
this
court,
principally
caldwell,
because--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--in
this
case,
i
believe
the
information
was
misleading
and
inaccurate.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
he
had
been
previously
sentenced
to
death,
and
as
a
historical
fact
it
was
correct.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
what
was
false
about
it
was
that
it
was
an
invalid
conviction.
at
the
time
that
this
sentence
of
death
was
presented
to
the
jury,
the
state
had
only
recently
obtained
the
conviction
and
it
had
not
yet
been
subjected
to
appellate
review.
when
it
was,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
the
sentence
and
the
conviction
and
sentence
was
a
violation
of
a
fair
trial,
result
of
an
unfair
trial,
and
that
both
had
to
vacated,
and
it
was
remanded
for
a
new
trial,
so
the
sentence
of
death
that
they
heard
about,
although
it
was
true
as
a
historical
fact,
it
was
not
a
valld
conviction.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
i
would,
because
i
also
believe
that
the
evidence
was
misleading.
it
led
the
jury
to
believe...
to
view
its
role
in
a
way
that
is
fundamentally
at
odds--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--the
factual
accuracy
of
that
document?
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
i
think
it
was
mere
formal
language
in
the
document.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
no.
even
if
the
evidence
was
not
misleading
or
inaccurate,
which
i
believe
it
was
both,
it
still
was
irrelevant
to
any
state
valid
penalogical
concern
that
the
defendant
had--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--i
think
it
would
have
the
opposite
effect.
i
think
that
it
would--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--yes,
unless
the
state
can
show
a
valid
state
penalogical
interest.
i
cannot
think
of
one.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
unless
the
state
can
show
that
there's
a
valid
state
penalogical
interest
in
showing
the
death
penalty,
that
i
cannot
think
of
one
at
the
moment.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
that
is
correct.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
certainly.
prior
convictions
are
relevant
to
a
concern
of
the
jury,
whether
he
is
a
threat
to
society,
for
example,
but--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--that
is
correct.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
i
think
that
would
certainly
present
a
much
closer
question
that
we
have
here.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
would
be.
there
would
be
competing
interests
there,
because
that
would...
the
state
would
have
an
arguably
valid
state
penalogical
interest.
i
think
the
important
thing--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--i
said
that
i
could
think
of
none,
and
maybe
this
would
present
a
circumstance
that
would
be
proper,
but
there
would
be
the
competing
interest
of
which...
is
it
more
probative,
or
is
it
more
prejudicial,
and
that
i
think
is
a
much
closer
question
than
we
have
presented
in
this
case.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
that's
the
prejudicial
impact
of
that
evidence,
is
that
it
would
diminish
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility.
they
would
believe
that
their
decision
did
not
matter.
a
man
can
only
be
killed
one
time,
so
they
would
believe--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--what
i
was
about
to
say
in
this
case
the
crime
that
he
got
the
death
penalty
for
was
committed
9
months
or
so
after
the
crime
that
he
was
on
trial
for
at
this
time.
if
a
defendant
kills
in
prison,
that,
i
think,
is
the
heart
of
that
aggravating
circumstance
if
the
state
elected
to
have
one,
that
he
killed
while
in
prison
or
under
a
sentence
of
death.
the
important
thing
there
is
that
society
cannot
be
protected
by
the
man.
he
has
been
incarcerated,
and
he
is
still
committing
crimes.
i
think
there
is
certainly
a
way
to
get
that
concern
before
the
jury
without
the
prejudicial
impact
of
undermining
their
sense
of
responsibility
by
telling
them
that
he's
already
been
sentenced
to
death.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
that's
correct.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
i
believe
it
was
misleading,
because
it--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--accurate,
but
misleading,
because
it
led
the
jury
to
believe
that
its
decision
did
not
matter.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
if
it--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--if
it
did
not
mislead
the...
i
mean,
if
it
did
not
undermine
the
sense
of
responsibility,
possibly
not,
but
if
we
have
both
of
those
factors,
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
if
it
renders
the
verdict
unreliable,
yes,
it
would
be,
even--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--not
if
any
misleading,
but
if
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
verdict
was
so
infected
that
it's
unreliable,
i
think
that
it
would
be.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
i
do
not
have
a
case
on
that.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
in
this
case,
i
do
not
think
it
was
perfectly
innocent
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor.
the
prosecutor
did
need
to
show
the
jury
that
john
romano
had
been
previously
convicted
of
a
murder,
that
defense
counsel
stipulated
to
that
fact.
to
get
the
document
in
was
of
no
help.
once
it
was
stipulated
to,
there
was
no
question
for
the
jury.
the
only
reason
that
the
state
introduced
the
document
as
well
would
be
to
get
this
inflammatory
information
before
the
jury.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
the
sentence
of
death
was
not
relevant
to
the
jury's
consideration,
and
all
lower
courts
that
have
considered
this
have
agreed,
with
one
exception,
that
being
pennsylvania,
interpreting
their
own
state
law.
even
the
state
has
not
seriously
argued
that
this
evidence
is
relevant
to
a
state
concern.
the
most
that
the
state
has
argued
in
their
brief
is
that
it
is
arguably
relevant
to
show
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
that's
correct.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
if
counsel
had
done
that,
i
think
he
would
have
been
precisely
within
the
confines
of
caldwell,
because
he
would
have
told
the
jury
that
not
only
was
that
jury's
verdict
subject
to
appeal,
but
so
was
this
jury's
verdict,
and
that
also
might
have
lessened
their
responsibility.
i
think
that
there
was
not
a
way
to
undo
what
was
done
by
the
admission
of
this
evidence.
what
evidence
of
a
death
sentence
really
does
is
to
create
an
image
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
that
their
decision
is
unimportant,
and
that
is
not
a
valid
state
penalogical
goal.
adding
to
the
prejudice
in
this
case
was
the
way
that
the
evidence
came
in...
the
way
that
the
information
came
before
the
jury.
it
came
in
the
form
of
evidence
rather
than
as
an
argument.
jurors
are
routinely
told
that
arguments
are
not
evidence,
and
that
jurors
are
to
base
their
decision
on
the
evidence.
the
jury
was
told
that
in
this
case.
they
were
invited
to
rely
the...
base
their
verdict
on
this
evidence
and
to
assign
whatever
weight
they
chose
to
it,
therefore
the
instructions
in
this
case
actually
compounded
the
prejudicial
effect.
the
other
thing
that
makes
this
evidence
especially
prejudicial
is
because
it's
not
information--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--by
the
instructions.
in
caldwell,
for
example,
it
was
an
argument
by
the
prosecutor
that
caused
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--the
fact
that
it
was
evidence,
and
juries
are
told
not
to
base
their
decision
on
argument
of
counsel.
they're
routinely
admonished
in
that
regard,
and
they
were
in
this
case,
they
were
in
caldwell,
but
the
court
did
not
feel
that
that
admonition
was
sufficient
to
cure
the
prejudice.
in
this
case,
the
instructions
did
not
mitigate
against
the
harmful
information,
but
actually
compounded
it,
because
the
jury
was
told
to
base
their
decision
on
evidence,
and
that
this
exhibit
was
an
item
of
evidence.
also,
the
information
this
jury
received
is
not
evidence
that
is
generally
already
known
to
the
jury
such
as
the
ability...
the
availability
of
appellate
review
or
powers
of
commutation,
but
information
that
was
specific
to
this
case
and
to
this
defendant.
a
jury
that
fully
understands
and
appreciates
the
gravity
of
its
task
is
vital
to
the
american
scheme
of
criminal
procedure.
it
is
indispensable
to
the
eighth
amendment's
need
for
reliability
in
the
determination
that
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment
in
a
specific
case.
were
we
not
lawyers
trained
to
question
and
dissect
the
obvious,
we
would
see
the
obvious,
and
that
is
that
evidence
that
a
capital
defendant
has
already
been
sentenced
to
die
by
another
jury
in
an
unrelated
case
injects
an
arbitrary
factor
that
undermines
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility
and
renders
the
verdict
unreliable.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
may
it
please
the
court:
mrs.
blalock
has
argued
that...
said
that
the
jury
was
never
told
that
the
verdict
was
not
up
to
them.
i
would
submit
that
this
piece
of
evidence,
like
a
picture,
was
worth
a
thousand
words.
they
did
not
need
to
be
explicitly
told
that
their
decision
did
not
matter.
there's
reason
in
this
record,
as
well
as
the
other
records
in
romano's
cases,
to
believe
that
this
jury
did
in
fact
approach
its
duty
with
less
care
than
it
was
required
to.
he
has
now
been
tried
by
three
juries
because
the
first
trial
was
vacated
and
he
was
retried
on
that.
in
all
three
of
those
cases,
the
juries
were
given
identical
information
going
to
whether
he
presents
a
continuing
threat
to
society.
the
only
difference
in
any
of
those
cases
was
in
this
case,
with
the
jury
having
the
added
knowledge
that
he
had
already
been
sentenced
to
die.
the
other
two
juries
found
that
the
state
did
not
prove
that
he
presents
a
continuing
threat
to
society.
only
the
jury
with
the
knowledge
that
he
had
already
been
sentenced
to
die
made
that
finding.
the
problem
with
what
the
court
of--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--if
prior
verdicts
are
irrelevant?
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
prior
death
sentences
are
irrelevant.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
only
what
impact
this
might
have
had
on
the
jury
as
an
illustration.
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
i'm
saying
that
the
death
sentence
was
highly
prejudicial,
and
that
that
evidences
what
might
have
happened
in
this
case.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--also,
on--
ms.
lee
ann
jones
peters
--certainly,
but
we
know
that
the
only
difference
in
what
the
jury
heard
was
evidence
of
the
death
sentence.
when
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
reviewed
this
case
and
reweighed,
as
i
said
before,
they
relied
on
an
instruction
that
was
not
given,
and
they
presumed
the
jury's
verdict
to
be
correct,
so
they
gave...
they
relied
on
findings
made
by
this
jury,
but
if
this
jury's
sentencing
responsibility
was
undermined,
its
findings
of
aggravating
factors
were
also
affected
and
could
not
be
relied
upon

been
sentenced
to
