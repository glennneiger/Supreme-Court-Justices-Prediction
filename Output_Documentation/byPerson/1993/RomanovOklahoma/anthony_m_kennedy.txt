justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
that
a
state
could
not
conclude
that
the
sentencing
process
is
enhanced
by
having
this
information,
that
as
a
matter
of
law
it
can
never
be
enhanced
by
the
jury
having
this
information?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
a
state
may
not
conclude
that
under
any
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me,
how
did
they
compound
the
prejudicial
effect?
i
just
didn't
follow
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh...
oh,
i
see,
the
fact
that
the
information
came
from
the
court
compounded
the
error.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
that
another
state
court
could
find
that
this
is
relevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
what
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
it
help
the
jury's
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
oklahoma
court
was
wrong
in
saying
that
it's
not
relevant,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
either
relevant
or
it
isn't,
and
you
say
the
oklahoma
court
is
right,
but
some
other
court
would
be
right
in
reaching
a
conclusion
that's
180
degrees
opposite
from
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i'm
having
trouble
deciding
which
is
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
legitimate
state
interest
is
what,
again?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
about
that.
i
take
it
that
under
the
petitioner's
submission,
if
a
juror
had
such
knowledge
that
would
be
a
ground
to
excuse
for
cause?
i
would
take
it
that
would
have
to
be
the
petitioner's
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
here
the
instruction
came
from
the
court,
which
gives
it
added
importance,
i
suppose,
and
added...
courts
don't
usually
instruct
on
irrelevant
matters.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
prior
verdicts
are
irrelevant,
why
are
you
telling
us
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
whole
point
is
that
it's
irrelevant
and
we
shouldn't
know--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
prior
sentences
are.
now
you're
telling
us
about
those.
