justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
peters,
may
i
ask
you
the
state
of
the
law
in
oklahoma
in
this
situation?
as
a
matter
of
oklahoma
law,
is
the
sentence
in
a
previous
case
relevant
for
the
jury
in
the
subsequent
proceeding
to
be
aware
of?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
fact
of
conviction
in
the
earlier
case
relevant
under
oklahoma
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
oklahoma
courts
in
this
case
acknowledge
that
it
wasn't
relevant
as
a
matter
of
state
law--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
sentence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
nevertheless
felt
it
was
not
a
constitutional
violation
that
the
error
was
not
harmful
in
a
constitutional
sense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
blalock,
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question?
was
the
prior
sentence
relevant
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
argue
that
it
was?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
any
event,
you
are
not
telling
us
that
it
was
relevant
as
a
matter
of
state
law--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
defendant
had
stipulated
to
instruct
the
jury
that
there
had
been
the
prior
conviction
of
murder?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
is
it,
then,
that
the
state
insisted
on
entering
this
piece
of
evidence
that
showed
the
sentence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
it's
just
curious,
since
it
was
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
there
had
been
a
stipulation.
i
just
wondered
why
it
was
that
the
state
insisted
on
putting
this
before
the
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
blalock,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
was
error
here,
did
it
have
to
conduct
harmless
error
analysis,
in
your
view?
