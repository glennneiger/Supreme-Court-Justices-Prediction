justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
peters,
in
caldwell,
as
i
recall,
it
wasn't
only
inaccurate,
what
was
told
to
the
jury,
but
it
was
intentionally
inaccurate.
i
mean,
it
was
misleading.
it
was
a
misleading
statement
by
the
prosecutor,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
no
contention
of
any
misleading
in
this
trial,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
it
turned
out
that
the
perfectly
accurate
statement
later
became
inaccurate,
because
the
conviction
was
set
aside,
but
at
the
time
it
was
said
it
was
perfectly
accurate.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
talk
about
that.
suppose
evidence
comes
out
during
a
trial
that
is
misleading.
is
that
a
basis
for
reversing
even
the
conviction,
never
mind
the
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
the
prosecutor
hasn't
been
responsible
for
it,
but
the
defendant
can
come
in
and
show,
what
this
witness
testified
to
was
misleading,
and
indeed
it
was
misleading,
is
that
a
basis
for
setting
aside
a
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
the
sense
of
responsibility
for
what
the
sentence
is,
it
could
have
misled
the
jury
as
to
the
conviction,
as
to
whether
the
person's
guilty
or
not,
but
if
the
prosecutor
has
not
been
responsible
for
that,
is
that
a
basis
for
reversing
the
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
a
case
for
that?
that's
extraordinary.
we
would
have
many
more
appeals
up
here
than
we
do
now,
if
any
misleading
evidence
is
a
basis
for
overturning
a
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
it's
true.
we
would
have
endless
appeals
if
that
were
the
case,
and
if
that's
not
the
case
with
respect
to
guilt
or
innocence,
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
why
perfectly
innocent
misleading
should
provide
an
automatic
appeal
with
respect
to
the
sentence,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
peters,
the
way
misleading
evidence
is
usually
entered
in
these
other
contexts,
in
the
context
of
a
trial,
is
that
counsel
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
counteract
it.
if
it's
misleading,
he
tells
the
jury,
this
is
misleading.
i
assume
counsel
here
could
have
said
that.
did
counsel
try
to
tell
the
jury,
yes,
there
is
a
conviction...
the
jury
was
told
it
was
on
appeal,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
jury
knew
that.
counsel
was
free
to
say,
as
you've
been
told,
it's
on
appeal.
it
may
be
reversed
on
appeal,
so
you
should
not
assume
that
this
individual
will
be
put
to
death.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
person
was
sentenced
one
way
or
another
is
irrelevant
to
the
determination,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
it
indicates
something
about
the
nature
of
the
person's
character,
and
the
only
way
it
can
do
that
is
that
one
presumes
that
a
prior
jury
doesn't
give
death
unless
it
was
a
really
horrible
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
done
here?
i
mean,
the
nature
of
the
prior
murder
for
which
the
conviction
was
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
all
the
nature
and
the
circumstances.
well,
then
i
don't
understand
why
the
death
penalty
in
the
earlier
case
was
relevant
any
more,
because
if
in
fact
the
jury
knows
first-hand
that
it
was
a
horrible
crime,
it
doesn't
have
to
know
that
second-hand
from
finding
out
that
the
death
penalty
was
imposed.
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
course,
that
third
conviction
might
have
been
the
only
one
that
was
on
a
tuesday,
too.
that
might
have
been
the
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
don't
know.
you're
just
saying
that
post
hoc,
therefore,
right,
that
was
the
reason.
you
don't
know
that
that's
the
reason.
maybe.
maybe
not.
