justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
question
of
law--
--well--
--that's
proved
like
a
question
of
fact,
because
the
materials
are
often
not
accessible
to
the
decisionmaker
because
they're
in
a
foreign
language
and
in
a
foreign
legal
culture.
so
they're
proved
through
witnesses--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
to
that
extent
you
can
call
them...
but
they're
not
questions
of
fact
in
that
they're
submitted
to
a
jury
to
decide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
was
not
considered
because
counsel
didn't
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention,
i
assume.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
can
understand
a
certain
degree
of
frustration
when
you
have
counsel
that
doesn't
call
attention
to
the
court
an
obvious
controlling
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
wasn't
the
house
full
of
guns?
wasn't
there
some
evidence
that
the
house
was
full
of
guns?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
davis,
could...
could
this
district
judge
have
found
that
case
and
applied
it
on
his
own
and
said
the
law
is
clearly
established?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
law...
so
it
really
turns
on
not
simply
what
counsel
present,
but
what
the
judge
found
or
failed
to
find
on
her
own
and
what
the
law
clerk
found
or
missed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
get
different
results
for
the
very
same
case
in
different
courts
depending
upon
the
diligence
of
the
judge
and
of
the
law
clerk?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
we
agreed
that
this
was
a
special
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
taken
with
respect
to
the
qualified
immunity
defense
because
of
that
line
in
the
scherer
opinion.
that
ordinarily
if
the
district
court
meant...
missed
a
controlling
precedent,
the
court
of
appeals
would,
of
course,
say,
district
court,
you
missed
our
clearly
established
law,
and
reverse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
would
apply
the
same
rule...
in
this
case
defendant...
plaintiff
was
counseled,
but
many
1983
cases
are
brought
up
pro
se
prisoners
who
may
not
have
the
latest
law
reports
in
the
library,
and
the
same
thing
would
go
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
going
back...
you
keep
talking
about
burden
of
proof,
so
you're
treating
law
as
fact
then,
if
you're
talking
burden
of
proof
language.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you've
already
said
it's
really
not
up
to
the
plaintiff
because
if
the
judge
had
found
the
law
on
her
own
or
his
own,
then
the
plaintiff
could
have
prevailed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
district
judge
doesn't
have
the
right
to
satisfy
the
plaintiff's
burden
of
proof
on
matters
of
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
davis,
just...
i
want
to
go
back
to
one
thing
you
said.
you
said
that
you
found
the
cases
distinguishable
because...
because
was
it
elder's
brother
had
been
the
one
to
make
the
telephone
call?
but
in
the
facts
as
the
ninth
circuit
reported
them,
holloway,
that's
the
defendant,
advised
him,
him
being
elder,
that
if
he
was
unable
to
walk
out
of
the
house,
he
should
crawl.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
that...
that
indicates
it
was
the
officer
who
got
him
to
come
out
of
the
house
and
not
the
brother.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
see
a
difference
between
an
officer
knocking
on
the
door
and
asking
someone
politely
to
come
out
and
an
officer
saying
to
someone
inside
of
a
house
if
you
can't
stand
up,
crawl
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
has
reached
a
unanimous
decision
in
this
civil
rights
action
brought
by
petitioner
charles
elder
against
idaho
police
officers
for
injuries
elder
sustained
during
a
white
list
arrest.
the
police
officers
prevailed
in
the
district
court
on
the
plea
of
qualified
immunity.
qualified
immunity
is
a
doctrine
that
shields
public
officials
from
suits
for
damages
unless
the
officers'
conduct
violated
clearly
established
law.
the
district
court
found
that
in
arresting
elder
the
idaho
police
did
not
violate
clearly
established
law.
on
elder's
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
noticed
a
decision
of
that
circuit
closely
in
point
a
decision
that
appeared
to
favor
elder.
however,
the
decision
had
not
been
mentioned
in
the
district
court
and
for
that
reason
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
take
it
into
account.
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
taken
account
of
the
decision,
when
an
appellate
court
reviews
the
judgment
holding
a
public
official
immune
from
an
action
for
damages
for
violation
of
the
federal
right
that
review
should
be
conducted
and
might
of
all
relevant
authorities
not
just
those
sided
to
or
discovered
by
the
district
court.
