david
h.
souter
and
under
rule
44
they
are
questions
of
law,
aren't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're...
you're
saying,
i
think,
that
there
may
be
more...
there
may
be
several
questions
involved
as
subsidiary
questions
in
determining
whether
ultimately
a
given
proposition
of
law
was
clearly
understood
at
the
time
in
question.
and
your
argument,
if
i
understand
it
is,
that
when
there
is
no
question
about
the
availability
of
the
legal
materials
on
which
this...
this
question
turns,
when
the
legal
materials
are,
in
fact,
published
law
reports,
that
the
only
issue
that
has...
the
only
question
that
has
to
be
answered
was
was
there
a
clear
statement
of
law
at
that
time,
and
that
is
itself
a
question
of
law.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and
in
this
case
you
don't
have
to
get
beyond
that...
that
question.
that's
implicit
in
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
claim
that
the...
that
the...
that
the...
that
the
law
reports
had
been
hidden
or
locked
away
from
people.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
