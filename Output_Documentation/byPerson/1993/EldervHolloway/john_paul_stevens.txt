justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
tankersley,
do
you
understand
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
to
apply
only
to
the
qualified
immunity
defense,
or
is
it
a
general
rule
that
applies
to
any
kind
of
comparable
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
ninth
circuit
practice,
mr.
tankersley?
do
they
have
a
practice
of
nonpublishing
opinions
from
time
to
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
have
a
no
citation
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
what
the
duty
of
counsel
would
be
before
the
district
court
if
he
had
an
unpublished
opinion
squarely
in
point?
say
the...
say
they
had
not
published
the
al-azzawy
opinion,
what
do
you
suppose
counsel's
duty
would
have
been?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
ninth
circuit
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
this
is
kind
of
interesting
because
both
sides
failed
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
and
it'd
be
relevant
on
a
couple
of
issues,
yet
helpful
to
one
on
one
and
helpful
to
the
other
on
the
other.
how
do
you
explain
the
defendant's
failure
to
cite
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
were
aware
of
it
and
you
did
not
call
it
to
the
district
court's
attention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
the
person
who
argued
aware
of
the
case
and
didn't
call
it
to
the
district
court's
attention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
consistent
with
normal
practice
in
california?
justice
john
paul
stevens
idaho,
pardon
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
it
helps
you
there,
but
what
about
your
duty
as
an
advisor
and
an
officer
of
the
court?
if
you
know
there's
a
case
in
point
on
the
other
issue,
even
if
it's
against
you,
do
you
think
you
have
any
obligation
to
advise
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do.
so
you
did
not
discharge
that
obligation
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
but
the
lawyer
who
did
argue
it
did
not
discharge
a
very
elementary
professional
obligation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure
it's
distinguishable,
but
we
affirmed
the
district
court's
ruling
that
al-azzawy
was
arrested
inside
his
residence
without
a
warrant.
that's
pretty
close
in
point
to
this
case.
