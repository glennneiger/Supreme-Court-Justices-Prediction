justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that's
a
special
rule?
i...
it's
been
a
long
time,
but
my
recollection
is
that
foreign
law,
for
example,
is
a
question
of
fact
in
the
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
might
not
prior
law
also
be...
certainly
current
law
is
not...
is
not
a
question
of
fact,
but
what
was
the
state
of
prior
law
at
a
particular
point
in
time,
why
can't
that
be
a...
why
isn't
that
a
question
of
fact?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
a
question
of
law
for
that
purpose.
that
is
to
say
you
determine
it
by
looking
at
legal
authorities.
but
the
issue
of
whether
it's
a
question
of
law
for
the
purpose
before
us
here,
just
as
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
question
of
law
for
purposes
of
whether
it's
a
jury
or
the
judge,
there
are
all
sorts
of
different
contexts
in
which
that
issue
could
come
up.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
looking
for
an
essentially
factual
matter
here,
aren't
we?
what
was...
on
the
basis
of
legal
authorities,
what
was
the
understood
nature...
not
what
was
the
real
law,
because
the
real
law
hasn't
changed,
it's
always
been
the
same,
but
what
was
the
understood
nature
of
the
law
at
that
time?
that's
a
question
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
foreign
law
is
a
question
of...
is
a
question
of
law,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
excuse
me,
but
this
isn't...
we're
not
looking
for
what
the
correct
rule
of
law
is.
we
know
what
the
correct
rule
of
law
is
now.
there
is
a
constitutional
right.
we
are
looking
for
a
state
of
understanding,
a
state
of
past
understanding,
not
a
state
of
law.
and
i
don't
see
how
any
analogies
to
what
the
law
is
bear
upon
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
looking
for
what
the
law
was
thought
to
be,
not
for
what
the
law
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's...
let's
assume
that
one
of
the
basic
elements
of
the
law
at
that
time
consisted
of
a
document,
let's
say
records
of
the
convention
or
something,
that
showed
that
a
particular
right
was
a
constitutional
right,
but
that
document
was...
had
not
yet
been
discovered
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
in
action.
now,
the
issue
of
when
it
was
discovered
is
crucial
to
what
the
understanding
of
the
law
was.
it's
not
crucial
to
what
the
law
was,
it's
crucial
to
the
understanding.
do
you
deny
that
that's
a
matter
of
fact,
when
was
the
document
discovered?
justice
antonin
scalia
when...
when
the
decision
was
pronounced,
whether
a
supreme
court
decision
came
down
before...
before
this
litigation
or
after
this,
isn't
that
a
question
of
fact?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
but
it's
not
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
law.
it's
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
court's
determination
of
what
the
understanding
of
the
law
was
back
then
will
be
wrong.
i
give
you
that
it
will
be
wrong.
but
will
it
be
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
or
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
certainly
the
general
rule
for
all
sorts
of
issues...
legal
issues,
that
can
simply
be
waived
by
the
district
court
by
not
being
raised--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
the
law
on
it
is
clear,
the
court
of
appeals
will
say,
well,
that
may
be,
but
we'll
treat
it
as
though
the
law
is
otherwise
simply
because
you
did
not
bring
it
to
the
district
court's
attention.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
depends--
--mr.
tankersley,
why
are
we
assuming
this
was
an
oversight
on
the
part
of
counsel?
one
of
the
problems
with
that
al-azzawy
authority
is
it
came
out,
in
the
end,
against
the
position
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
win
on
here.
that
is,
the
bottom
line
of
that
case
was
there
were
exigent
circumstances
so
that
the
arrest
could
proceed
without
a
warrant.
why
isn't
it
likely
here
that
counsel
knew
about
the
precedent,
didn't
want
to
cite
it,
because
here
too
there
was
a
substantial
question
of
exigent
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
assume
the
worst.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
it's
going
to
have
any
effect
upon
officers'
conduct.
they
will
assume
that
all
the
extant
authority
will
be
cited.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
what
should
happen
when
all
of
it
hasn't
been.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tankersley,
on
the...
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
can
be
any
precedential
value
to
decisions
under
the
ninth
circuit's
regime,
as
i
understand
the
ninth
circuit
it
is
not
mandatory
that
you...
that
you
not
take
account
of
opinions
not
cited,
it's
simply
optional.
so
if
the
court
chooses
to,
it
could
say
we
are
conducting
a
thoroughgoing
review
of
this
issue
on
our
own,
not
simply
relying
upon
the
cases
cited
by
counsel,
and
having
done
that,
we
find
that
the
law
was
certain
or
was
uncertain.
and
that
decision
would
certainly
have
precedential
effects.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
agree
with
petitioners,
do
you
not,
that
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
a
rule
that
you
must
not
consider
it,
not
that
you
need
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
let
you
consider
it
at
all
on
appeal.
