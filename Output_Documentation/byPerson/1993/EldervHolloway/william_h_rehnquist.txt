in
no.
92-8579,
charles
elder
v.
r.
d.
holloway.
mr.
tankersley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ninth
circuit
itself
just
relied
on
one,
didn't
it,
that
al-azzawy
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
tankersley,
supposing
we
agree
with
you
on
your
main
point,
what
can
the
district
courts
or
the
ninth
circuit
do,
if
anything,
about
a
situation
where
a
party
simply
doesn't...
fails
to
call
the
district
court's
attention
to
what
may
be
a
controlling
case
and
raises
it
for
the
first
time
on
appeal?
are
they
just
stuck
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
here...
here
the
district
court
was
really
mousetrapped.
i
mean,
the...
surely
a
district
judge
has
a
right
to
assume,
just
as
you
say,
that
the
parties
will
have
submitted
all
the
relevant
authorities.
he
rules
on
the
basis
of
those
authorities
and
it
turns
out
that
there
is
an
authority
on
the
other
side
which
was
never
even
mentioned
to
him
by...
by
the
parties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well
an
oversight
on
the
part
of
counsel
who
have
simply
failed
to
do
their
job.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
tankersley.
mr.
davis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
davis,
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
basically
the
one
i
believe
mr.
tankersley
was
arguing,
that
is
whether
the
appeals
court
should
be
able
to
disregard
legal
authorities
that
were
not
cited
to
the
district
court.
i
presume
you're
going
to
deal
with
that
question,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
fairly
soon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
davis...
i
think
i
speak
for
my
colleagues
as
well...
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
simply
decided
this
qualified
immunity
issue
on
the
merits
one
way
or
the
other,
we
never
would
have
granted
certiorari.
the
point
we
granted
certiorari
on
was
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
that
if
a
case
wasn't
cited
to
the
district
court
on
the
basis...
to
show
the
existing
state
of
the
law
at
the
time,
it
couldn't
be
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
what
we
want
to
try
to
decide
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
term
invited
error
really
applies.
i'm
just
trying
to
think
the
thing
through.
i
think
of
invited
error
as
being
typically
a...
when
you
yourself
request
an
instruction
to
a
jury
that
you
later...
that
you
later
regret,
and
there
you
have
something
quite
different
here,
that
it
can't
be
corrected
because
the
jury
has
already
finished
its
deliberations.
but
here
there
was
never
any
relinquishment,
as
i
understand
it,
by
the
plaintiff
of
their
claim
of
violation
or
their
assertion
that
clearly
established
law
established
their
right.
it
was
just
a
failure
to
find
a
case
supporting
that
proposition.
do
you
think
that
fairly
fits
into
the
head
of...
under
the
head
of
invited
error?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
mr.
tankersley,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tankersley.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-8579,
elder
against
holloway
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
