mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
qualified
immunity
issue
in
civil
rights
actions
is
governed
by
a
special
rule
that
requires
that
appellate
courts
treat
legal
authorities
as
if
they
were
facts
such
that
the
appellate
court
is
required
to
blind
itself
to
relevant
and
potentially
controlling
legal
authorities
if
those
authorities
were
not
presented
to
or
considered
by
the
district
court
below.
in
the
proceedings
below
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
that
the
qualified
immunity
issue...
on
appeal,
the
legal
authorities
that
are
relevant
to
that
must
be
treated
as
if
they
are
no
other
legal
authorities
other
than
those
that
were
cited
to
or
discovered
by
the
district
court.
the
appellate
court,
according
to
this
ruling,
may
not
consider
other
legal
authorities
it
is
aware
of
even
if
those
authorities
demonstrate
that,
contrary
to
the
district
court's
ruling,
there
is
no
qualified
immunity
because
at
the
time
of
the
incident
it
was
clearly
established
that
the
officer's
conduct
violated
the
plaintiff's
civil
rights.
this
is
a
special
rule
established
only
for
the
qualified
immunity
issue
in
civil
rights
cases.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
well,
it's
a
question
of
law
because
in
all
of
this...
this
court's
cases
dealing
with
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
this
court
has
stated
that
it's
a
pure
question
of
law.
and
the
ascertainment
of
that
is
governed,
as
with
any
other
question
of
law,
by
have...
by
looking
at
decisions
precedent,
statutes,
other
sources
of
legal
authority.
foreign
law--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--no,
i
believe
that's
a
question
of
law,
because
it's
a
question
which
does
not
go
to
trying
to
ascertain
evidence
in
the
sense
of
evidence
that
may
be
impeached
or
contradicted
or
contradictory.
proof...
burdens
of
proof
ordinarily
deal
with
that
kind
of
problem,
dealing
with
the
risk
of
uncertainty
in
trying
to
ascertain
from
evidence
whether
or
not
a
particular
fact
occurred.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
foreign
law
is
a
question
that
is--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--that's
true--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
foreign
law
is
a
question
of
law,
but
this
court's
decisions
have
also
repeatedly
emphasized
that
certainly
questions
of
federal
law
are
questions
of
law,
ascertaining
what
the
legal
authorities
are.
and,
indeed,
in
federal
courts
questions
of
ascertaining
what
the
state
law
is
is
also
a
question
of
law
on
which
principles
of
forfeiture
or
estoppel
because
a
party
didn't
introduce
particular
facts
in
the
proceedings
below
simply
are
inapplicable.
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
in
dealing
with
deciding
a
question
of
law,
courts
are
not
limited
to
merely
selecting
among
what
has
been
presented
by
the
parties
or
the
contrasting
interpretations
of
the
authorities
that
have
been
presented,
but
have
an
independent
obligation
to
ascertain
what
the
correct
rule
of
law
is.
and
that
applies
equally
in
the
context
of
the
qualified
immunity
question
where
the--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--because
the
process
for
determining
what
the
law
was
is
essentially
the
same
process
as
a
court
now
going
to
decide
what
the
question
is.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
and
the
process
is
the
same.
if
the
question
was
what
is
the
law,
the
first
question
a
court
would
have
to
address
is
is
there
a
prior
precedent
or
statute
or
other
source
of
authority
that
clearly
establishes
what
the
law
in
this
particular
is...
issue
is.
and
in
the
qualified
immunity
context,
the
inquiry
stops
there,
but
it
is
the
same
inquiry
as
in
addressing
any
other
question
of
law.
the
sources
that
the
court
looks
to
are
the
same,
the
canons
of
construction
that
the
court
uses
are
the
same,
the
principles
that
apply
are
the
same.
what
this
rule
does
is
it
alters
and,
indeed,
distorts
the
appellate
inquiry.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
that
would...
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
necessarily
go
to
a
question
of
fact.
that--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--the
date
that
an
authority
becomes
known
is
a
factual
matter
in
the
sense
that
it
happens
on
a
particular
date.
it
is
not
a
factual
matter
in
the
sense
that
rules
of
estoppel
or
preclusion
apply
to
prohibit
an
appellate
court
from
considering
that
on
appeal.
what
was
done
in
the
ninth
circuit
here
is
to
translate
the
concept
of
burden
of
proof
that
applies
to
fact,
in
the
sense
that
parties
should
not
be
able
to
introduce
new
facts
into
the
record
on...
in
the
appellate
process,
a
process
that
would
introduce
unfairness
into
the
proceedings
because
the
new
facts
could
not
be
cross-examined,
the
other
side
would
not
have
the
same
opportunity
to
rebut
those
facts
in
the
record.
the
ninth
circuit
took
those
principles
and
translated
them
to
legal
authorities
where
they
are
inappropriate,
whether
authorities
are
equally
accessible
to
both
the
appellate
and
the
district
courts,
and
to
both
sides
in
the
litigation.
and
what
was
done
here
is
establishing
a
rule
that
says
an
appellate
court
must
announce
and,
indeed,
affirm
a
legal
ruling
that
is...
that
is
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
law,
demonstrably
incorrect,
because
the
authorities
necessary
to
identify
the
error
were
not
identified
below.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
it
will
be
an
incorrect
statement
of
what
the
law
is,
and
resolution
of
what
this
court
has
said
is
a
purely
legal
issue.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
yes,
it
is.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
no.
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--no.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
there
is
no
claim
that
it
was
inaccessible,
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here
is
say
that
you
only
look
to
the
district
court
record,
defining
the
record
as
being
the
legal
authorities
that
were
also
cited.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
it
is
the
same
objective
test
announced
in
all
this
court's
qualified
immunity
cases,
in
terms
of
what
was
the
announced
law
at
that
time
in
the
reporters
or
other
authorities
that
are
accessible
and
establish
law.
was
it
reasonably
anticipated...
clearly
established
from
those
authorities
that
what...
that
the
conduct
violated
the
plaintiff's
civil
rights.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
authorities
that
come
down
after
the
conduct
would
not
be
ones
that
could
be
looked
to
for
answering
this
question.
we
agree
that
it's
only
authorities
that
are
available
in
the
reporters,
in
the
statute
books,
as
of
the
day
of
the
conduct.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
they
do
not
talk
about
inter-circuit
conflicts.
the
situation
in
this
particular
case
is
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
incident
there
were
three
circuit
court
opinions
addressing
similar
factual
situations,
all
of
which
came
out
the
same
way,
saying
that
in
a
situation
where
an
individual
is
in
a
residence
and
the
officers
go
to
arrest
him
at
that
residence
and
effectuate
the
arrest
by
surrounding
it
and
ordering
him
to
come
out
with
a
show
of
force,
a
warrant
is
required
in
order
to
effectuate
that
arrest,
absente
exigent
circumstances.
since
that
time
there's
been
one
additional
decision
which
also
has
come
out
the
same
way.
there's
no
inter-circuit
conflict
on
this.
but
what
the
ninth--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--yes.
what
was
at
issue
here
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
ninth
circuit
opinion
directly
addressing
this
issue
which
was
not
considered
by
the
district
court
and
which
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
might
control
the
outcome
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
this
is
not
about
the
court's
frustration,
but
about
what
the
proper
rule
for
ascertaining
what
the
correct
resolution
of
the
legal
issue
is
here.
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
establish
a
special
rule
which
essentially
says
that
every
appellate
court
decision
issued
under
this
rule
only
establishes
a
precedent
and
announces
the
rule
of
law
for
those
particular
parties
with
respect
to
the
particular
authorities
that
were
cited
in
the
district
court.
so
in
order
to
properly
ascertain
the
precedential
effect
of
an
appellate
court
decision
under
this
rule,
you
would
have
to
have
an
appendix
identifying
the
precise
authorities
that
were
considered.
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged,
a
subsequent
case
coming
up
where
other
authorities
were
cited
would
not
be
governed
by
that
appellate
court
ruling.
the
effect
of
this
is
that
if
two
individuals
were
arrested
in
this
particular
residence
at
the
time
that
the
petitioner
was
arrested
and
the
second
individual
brought
a
separate
1983
action
for
damages,
assigned
to
a
separate
district
court
judge
who
was
aware
of
the
al-azzawy
decision,
and
that
judge
also
dismissed
the
case
on
the
grounds
of
qualified
immunity,
in
review
of
that
case
the
ninth
circuit
would
be
compelled
to
consider
the
al-azzawy
decision
and
potentially
reach
a
totally
different
outcome,
whereas
in
this
case
it
was
not
considered
and
not
part
of
the
legal...
the
resolution
of
the
legal
issue.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
a
big
problem,
because
the
incentives
for
plaintiffs
to
cite
every
possible
helpful
authority
are
already
there.
there's
no
incentive
for...
particularly
a
plaintiff
in
this
situation,
to
not
cite
helpful
authority
that
they're
aware
of
in--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
only
effect
of
this
rule
and
the
fact
that
you're
able
to
consider
this
additional
authority
on
appeal
is
that
the
appellate
court
may
decide
that
the
district
court's
resolution
of
the
legal
issue
was
wrong.
that--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--that
is
something
which
follows
from
the
fact
that
it
is
the
role
of
appellate
courts
to
correct
legal
errors,
even
if
they
are
due
to
an
oversight
in
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
it...
it
was
an
oversight
on
the
part
of
counsel,
but
it
was
also
a
matter
of
fact
that
this
case
was
on
the
books
and
in
opinions
that
the
district
court
also
relied
upon.
the
fact
of
the--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--i
understand
this
rule
to
apply...
to
be
a
interpretation
of
this
court's
language
in
davis
v.
scherer,
and
for
that
reason
to
apply
only
to
the
qualified
immunity
defense
on
the
basis
that
they
interpreted
that
language,
which
says
that
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
the
law
was
clearly
established,
as
providing
that
legal
authorities
in
this
unique
context
are
to
be
treated
as
if
they
were
matters
of
fact,
legal
facts.
so
it
does
not
extend
to
other
contexts.
although
the
issue
that
justice...
justice
rehnquist
has...
or
mr.
chief
justice
has
raised
has...
applies
equally
to
other
contexts
where
legal
issues
are
at
stake.
where
there
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
presented
or
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
it
is
also
the
case
that
the
parties,
as
a
matter
of
persuading
the
court,
have
to
bring
before
the
court
whatever
helpful
legal
authorities
they
have.
if
there
was
a
real
concern
that
the
way
to
deal
with
parties
failing
to...
deal
with
that
and
cite
the
helpful
authorities
in
the
district
court
proceedings,
there
would
have
to
be
a
general
rule.
but
it
has
never
been
the
general
rule
that
in
deciding
a
legal
issue,
whether
it
be
for
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant,
the
appellate
court
is
only
to
consider
the
authorities
that
were
presented
in
the
district
court
below.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
legal
issues--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--legal
issues
can
be
raised,
but
legal
issues
present
a
different
matter
than
legal
arguments.
because
this
court
itself
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
arguments
that
go
to
a
particular
issue
are
not
foreclosed
merely
because
they
were
not
raised
below.
as
long
as
the
issue
was
raised
below,
the
parties
can
raise
any
argument
that
goes
to
the
proper
resolution
of
that
issue
and,
indeed,
the
court,
whether
it
be
a
district
court,
appellate
court,
or
this
court,
can
consider
any
arguments,
issues,
or
authorities
that
help
resolve
that
issue.
because
the
imperative
in
the
context
of
legal
issues
is
to
get
the
resolution
of
the
issue
right.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
this
goes
beyond
the
record,
but
that
was
not
the
case
here.
but
our
basic--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--your
honor,
we
acknowledge,
and
it's
clear
from
the
district
court
opinion,
that
in
order
to
prevail
in
this
case
we
have
to
overcome
the
exigent
circumstances
issue.
but
al-azzawy
is
distinguishable
on
the
exigent
circumstances
issue
because
that
was
an
instance
where
the
arrest
was
made
after
getting
a
call
the
morning
of
the
arrest.
in
this
case
the
officers
had
information
about
the
petitioner,
about
the
fact
that
he
was
in
town,
where
he
was
living,
5
days
beforehand.
they
went
out
to
surveil
the
residence
the
weekend
before,
located
the
petitioner
there,
and
during
the
course
of
this
entire
conduct
in
planning,
making
the
arrest,
made
no
effort
to
get
an
arrest
warrant.
the
exigent
circumstances
issue
is
one
that
the
district
court
decided
not
to
resolve
because
the
facts
were
disputed,
and
there's...
we
don't
dispute
that
that
portion
of
the
al-azzawy
decision
is
one
that
we
have
to
distinguish
on
in
prevailing
on
this
qualified
immunity
issue.
but
the
important
point
here
is
that
the
fact
that
it
has
that
language
does
not
preclude
it
being
an
authority
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
warrant
was
required
to
effectuate
the
arrest
in
the
first
place.
the
other
aspect
of
this
rule
that
is
offensive
and
strikes
at
the
very
balance
that
this
court
has
struck
in
qualified
immunity
cases,
is
it
disrupts
the
balance
that
the
objective
standard
tries
to
strike
between
the...
protecting
the
legitimate
exercise
of
official
discretion
and
the
opposing
interest
of
making
sure
that
there's
a
remedy
when
official
misconduct
violates
clearly
established
federal
rights.
the
premise
of
qualified
immunity
is
that
the
conduct
should
be
judged
based
on
an
objective
standard
that
is
predictable
and
is
not
the
standard
of
what
the
officer
thought
the
law
should
be
or
what
the
court
determines
in
hindsight
it
should
be.
what
this
rule
does
is
change
that
standard
to
a
rule
of
pleading.
where
there
is
what
is
essentially
a
subjective
standard,
the
rule
of
law
can
change
for
each
individual
plaintiff
depending
on
the
citations
that
are
made
in
the
district
court
after
the
fact.
it's
also
an
unpredictable
standard.
there's
no
way
that
an
officer
at
the
time
of
the
conduct
can
anticipate
what
set
of
authorities
will
be
cited,
and
therefore
what
rule
of
law
will
be
applied.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
but
it
also...
it
does
answer
the
question
that
there
is
nothing
about
this
rule
that
serves
the
interests
that
are
behind
qualified
immunity.
as
you
observe,
it
doesn't
do
anything
to
protect
the
exercise
of
official
discretion
or
enhance
deterrence.
what
it
does
do,
however,
is
deny
claims,
meritorious
claims
by
civil
rights
plaintiffs
merely
on
the
fact
that
the
authority
was
not
cited
below.
the
effect
of
this
is
that
an
appellate
court
will
be
required
to
affirm
the
dismissal
of
a
civil
rights
claim
by
a
victim
of
a
civil
rights
violation,
not
on
the
basis
that
the
official's
conduct
should
be
subject
to
an
immunity
under
the
balance
of
the
interests
that
this
court
has
identified,
but
solely
on
the
basis
that
the
necessary
authorities
were
not
cited
in
the
court
below.
this
results
in
an
unjust
resolution
of
cases,
because
it
is...
it
has
to
be
accepted
that
the
proper
application
of
these
interests
and
the
test
established
in
harlow
results
in
the
proper
disposition
of
civil
rights
cases
where
the
qualified
immunity
issue
is
presented.
but
this
rule
provides
that
there
will
be
a
different
resolution
in
particular
cases,
depending
upon
what
the
citations
of
authority
in
the
district
court
were.
as
enunciated
by
the
ninth
circuit,
this
rule
applies
regardless
of
whether
the
party
is
represented
or
not,
regardless
of
how
severe
the
official
misconduct
is,
and
regardless
of
how
serious
the
injury
that
the
civil
rights
plaintiff
suffered.
it
is
an
imperfection
in
our
system
that
the
outcome
of
a
party's
case
often
turns
on
the
thoroughness
of
the
legal
research
in
the
district
court,
and
that
is
an
imperfection
that
is
visited
most
harshly
on
pro
se
plaintiffs
and
individuals
who
have
limited
access
to
legal
representation,
but
what
this
rule
does
is
elevate
that
imperfection
into
a
rule
of
law.
in
summary,
the
rule
that's
been
announced
by
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong
precisely
because
it
alters
the
appellate
process
so
that
legal
research
during
the
district
court
proceedings
will
alter
the
appellate
court's
responsibility
of
correcting
legal
errors
and
making
sure
that
legal
issues
were
determined
based
on
all
the
authorities
that
the
appellate
court
is
aware
of.
it
is
also
wrong
because
there
is
no
justification
for
denying
a
meritorious
civil
rights
claim
or
creating
an
immunity
for
an
officer
based
on
what
particular
authorities
were
cited
in
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
yes,
they
do.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
i
believe
the
rule
is
that
the
opinion
cannot
be
used
as
authority
for
subsequent
precedents.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
your
honor--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--under
the
ninth
circuit
rule
the...
it
could
not--
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
--well,
i
think
it
could
not
be
relied
upon
for
authority
and
the
issue
would
then
arise
whether
or
not
an
unpublished
opinion
is
relevant
for
the
clearly
established
determination,
which
is
one
that,
thankfully,
is
not
presented
in
this
case,
and
as
far
as
i
know
has
not
been
addressed
by
this
court
or
the
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
i
disagree
with
that,
in
that,
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
at
the
appellate
level
they
read
this
court's
decision
in
davis
v.
scherer
as
mandating
that
the
appellate
court
is
not
to
take
into
account
other
decisions
that
it's
aware
of,
that
it
believes
are
relevant,
that,
in
fact,
it
thinks
may
be
controlling,
if
those
decisions
were
not
cited
in
the
court
below.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
if
there
are
not
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
e.
tankersley
unless
there
are
any
other
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
