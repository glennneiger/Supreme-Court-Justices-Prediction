mr.
james
j.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client,
r.
d.
holloway,
was
neither
plainly
incompetent
nor
did
he
knowingly
violate
the
law.
that
is
the
issue
we
ask
this
court
to
examine
in
deciding
this
case.
overlaid
upon
that
issue
are
two
procedural
issues
which
were
raised
and
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
panel,
and
that
is
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
when
qualified
immunity
is
raised
by
pretrial
motion
and
what
appellate
standard
of
review
should
be
employed
in
reviewing
an
order
resolving
a
pretrial
motion
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
first,
then,
we
would
like
to
address
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
mr.
james
j.
davis
i
do
intend
to
do
that,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
james
j.
davis
i
will,
your
honor,
thank
you.
we
are
guided
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue
by
four
recent
supreme
court
cases.
in
a
nutshell,
those
cases
instruct
us
that
mr.
holloway
was
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
if
any
reasonable
officer...
any
reasonable
officer
could
have
believed
the
arrest
was
lawful
in
light
of
clearly
established
law.
the
inquiry,
as
established
by
this
court,
is
twofold.
you
first
have
to
look
at
the
information
the
officer
possessed
at
the
time
he
committed
the
act
he
committed,
and
secondly
you
look
at
the
law
to
determine
whether
it
was
clearly
established.
to
look
at
the
information
that
was
within
holloway's
possession,
we
need
to
focus
six
days
before
he
was
arrested--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
will...
i'm
familiar
with
the
washington
yakima
indian
nation
case,
which
would
allow
the
party
who
was
successful
below
to
rely
on
any
grounds,
but
in
deference
to
the
court
i
will
proceed
to
address
the
issue.
what
petitioner
would
ask
this
court
to
do
is
decide
the
standard
of
review
question
in
a
vacuum.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
get
to
that
question
until
it
first
resolved
the
burden
of
proof
question,
which
it
raised
on
its
own.
mr.
james
j.
davis
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes,
that
can
happen,
but
it
can
happen
any
time
a
court
of
appeals
exercises
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
or
any
time
that
a
counsel
mistakenly
doesn't
present
either
a
factual
basis
or
a
legal
basis
for
their
claim.
mr.
james
j.
davis
i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
j.
davis
my
understanding
is
that
it
is
a
de
novo
standard.
mr.
james
j.
davis
that's
correct.
what
the
ninth
circuit
did...
and
i'm
jumping
ahead
and
i
will
come
back
to
it.
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
it
applied
a
limited
de
novo
standard
for
review
of
the
burden
of
proof
issue.
mr.
james
j.
davis
yes,
i
believe--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--yes.
mr.
james
j.
davis
unfortunately,
i
think
that
happens
in
our
system,
but
we
already
have
that
unfortunate
circumstance
as
a
result
of--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--on...
as
i
understand
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
which
we
did
not
request,
it
was
that
there
is
a
limited
scope
of
review
under
the
de
novo
standard
whenever
the
determination
is
made
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
meet
their
burden
of
proof.
did
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
james
j.
davis
that's
correct.
again,
i
would
like
to
go
back
and
advise
the
court
that
this
decision
was
not
made
in
a
vacuum.
the
court
of
appeals
first
determined
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof
or
burden
of
persuasion
as
to
what
clearly
established
law
is.
having
made
that
decision,
which
i
believe
is
justified
by
this
court's
decisions
and
by
the
policy
considerations
cited
in
the
brief,
the
issue
it
had
to
address,
and
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
on,
is
the
standard
of
review
to
be
applied.
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
a
meaningless
decision
placed
on
the
plaintiff
if
the
plaintiff
was
allowed
at
some
later
time
to
amend
or
add
additional
authorities.
mr.
james
j.
davis
i
am
not
treating
it
as
fact.
i
am...
as
i
understand
this
court's
precedents
and
as
all
of
the
circuit
courts,
except
for
the
third,
have
understood
this
court's
precedents,
it
is
up
to
the
plaintiff
to
make
some
showing
in
response
to
a
defendant's
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
there
was
a
clearly
established
right.
and
i
am
not
likening--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--certainly,
the
district
court
judge
has
the
right
to--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--that's
correct.
the...
if
this
court
adopts
the
burden
of
proof
standard
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
put
in
place
and
that
all
of
the
other
circuits
have
put
in
place,
that
the
plaintiff
must
show
the
clearly
established
law,
then
the
limited
review
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
advanced
is
a
logical
extension
of
that
rule.
but
in
this
situation
i
think
more
than
the
burden
of
proof,
the
problem
here
was
the
failure
of
plaintiff's
counsel
to
locate
the
case
that
was
ultimately
found
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
invited
error.
the
standard
that
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
here
was
the
result
of
the
failure
to
cite
case
law
which
clearly
established
that
my
officer
acted
unreasonably.
that
is
what
prompted
this
decision.
mr.
james
j.
davis
i
think
it's
no
different,
mr.
chief
justice,
than
the
circumstance
where
the
plaintiff
fails
to
find
the
appropriate
jury
instructions
and
fails
to
offer
them
to
the
district
court.
whether
it's
a
failure
to
find
a
particular
case
and
cite
it
to
the
court
or
it's
a
failure
to
find
case
law
and
jury
instructions
which
support
your
position,
the
result
should
be
the
same.
mr.
james
j.
davis
i
was
aware
of
the
decision.
i
didn't
argue
the
case.
mr.
james
j.
davis
i
did
not
argue
the
case,
your
honor
and
i
advised--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--that
is
correct.
mr.
james
j.
davis
it's
in
idaho.
mr.
james
j.
davis
no,
it
isn't.
the
reason
that
i
wanted
the
case
to
be
offered
was
because
i
felt
that
on
the
exigent
circumstances
portion
of
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
before
the
district
court
it
was
extremely
helpful.
mr.
james
j.
davis
absolutely.
mr.
james
j.
davis
in
this
instance
i
did
not
argue
the
motion
and
i
do
not--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--i
would
have
to
say,
your
honor,
that
it
is
a
case
that...
if
i
had
been
there,
i
would
have
provided
to
the
district
court
judge.
however,
i
believe
that
the
al-azzawy
decision
is
distinguishable
from
the
case
that
we
presented,
and
that...
and
the
ethical
distinction--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--the...
the
other
circumstance
that
all
of
these
cases
have
relied
upon
is
that
there
was
direct
excessive
coercion
which
required
the
person
to
come
outside
the
residence.
in
the
ninth
circuit
we
had
a
case,
united
states
v.
botero,
where
the
officers
had
gone
up
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
the
suspect
came
to
the
door
and
he
was
arrested
and
it
was
determined
that
that
was
an
appropriate
arrest
under
the
fourth
amendment.
what
my
officers
did
was
they
had
the
suspect's
case...
suspect's
brother
in
this
case
get
on
the
telephone
and
call
him
and
ask
him
to
come
out.
i
don't
see
how
using
the
telephone
and
asking
him
to
come
out
can
be
any
more
intrusive
than
going
and
knocking
on
the
door
and
having
the
suspect
come
out.
certainly,
after
u.s.
v.
botero
the
law
was
not
clearly
established
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
what
my
officer
did
did
not...
would
not
allow
him
to
have
qualified
immunity
in
this
case.
the
one
thing
that
i
do
want
to
caution
this
court
to
be
wary
of
is
plaintiff's
argument...
is
the
petitioner's
argument
that
the
appellate
court
has
a
duty
to
consider
law
not
cited
by
the
parties.
mr.
james
j.
davis
that
is
correct.
the
record
establishes
that
the
initial
telephone
contact
was
made
by
the
brother,
and
it
was
after
the
brother
had
talked
to
his...
to
mr.
elder,
the
suspect
who
was
in
the
house,
that
the
officer
got
on
the
phone
to
ask
him
what
the
problem
was.
because
at
that
point
mr.
elder
was
saying
that
he'd
had
a
seizure
and
had
been
injured
inside
the
home.
the
problem
with
the--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
my
point
was
not
who
made
the
contact.
my
point
was
in
the
ninth
circuit
we
had
a
case,
u.s.
v.
botero,
where
the
officers
knocked
on
the
door
and
the
suspect
came
out
and
he
was
arrested,
and
that
was
held
to
be
an
appropriate
arrest
under
the
fourth
amendment.
my
point
is
what
my
officers
did
was
have
the
brother,
or
the
officer,
talk
to
him
and
ask
him
to
come
out,
and
i
don't
see
how
that
is
any
more
intrusive
than
the
circumstance
where
the
officer
knocks
on
the
door.
and
it's
certainly
consistent,
at
least
according
to
the
ninth
circuit,
with
united
states
v.
santana,
in
which
it
was
held
that
a
person
standing
in
the
threshold
of
the
doorway
could
legally--
mr.
james
j.
davis
--at
the
time
that
statement
was
made
the
man
claimed
that
he
had
had
a
seizure,
and
the
officer
was
telling
him
to
crawl
out
so
that
he
didn't
risk
injury.
in
the
record,
holloway's
wife
is
an
epileptic,
so
he
was
familiar
with
epilepsy
and
he
was
simply
advising
him
to
come
out
in
a
safe
manner.
my
concern,
again,
is
that
this
court
should
be
wary
of
elder's
position.
he
would
impose
a
duty
upon
any
court
of
appeal,
including
this
court,
to
consider
law
not
cited
by
the
parties,
even
if
the
failure
was
strategic
or
constituted
invited
error.
such
a
position
would
limit
the
discretion
of
this
court.
it
would
be
compelled,
as
would
any
court
of
appeals,
to
become
the
researchers
for
the
litigants.
mr.
james
j.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
davis
that
is
my
understanding
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
framed
the
issue,
they
framed
it
by
saying
failed
to
cite
to
the
district
court
and
failed
to
cite
to
us
on
appeal,
and
i
think
they
were
exasperated
and
frustrated
by
the
fact
that
at
oral
argument
they
said
here's
this
al-azzawy
case,
and
plaintiff's
counsel
distinguished
it
instead
of
adopting
it.
so
i
think
their
position
was
motivated
by
error,
by
invited
error.
the
panel
decision
does
maintain
the
court
as
a
neutral
arbitrator.
instead
of
going
out
and
doing
the
research
for
the
litigants,
it
is
to
decide
the
legal
question
of
what
the
law
was
based
upon
the
record
that's
presented
to
it.
the
panel
decision
also
advances
the
social
policies
that
this
court
announced
in
harlow
and
would
also
advance
the
burden
of
proof
issues.
in
the
final
analysis...
since
i'm
addressing
the
issue
that
the
court
asked
me
to
address
rather
than
the
merits
of
the
case,
i'm
going
to
finish
a
little
early.
in
the
final
analysis,
the
court
should
affirm
the
panel
because
my
deputy,
holloway,
acted
reasonably.
he
was
not
plainly
incompetent
and
he
did
not
knowingly
violate
the
law.
thank
you
very
much.
