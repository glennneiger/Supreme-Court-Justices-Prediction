justice
clarence
thomas
these
consolidated
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
oregon
supreme
court.
the
state
of
oregon
imposes
a
fee
on
disposal
of
non-hazardous
solid
waste.
the
fee
for
waste
generated
out
of
state
is
$2.25
per
ton.
the
fee
for
identical
waste
generated
within
oregon
is
$0.85
per
ton.
petitioners
challenge
the
higher
fee
on
wastes
form
other
states
as
voilation
of
the
commerce
clause.
the
state
court
of
appeals
rejected
their
commerce
clause
challenge,
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
oregon
supreme
court.
the
negative
aspect
of
the
commerce
clause
prohibits
states
form
unjustifiably
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce.
the
oregon
fee
structure
facially
discriminates
because
it
imposes
a
higher
fee
on
wastes
from
other
states
than
wastes
from
within
oregon.
absent
proof
that
out
of
state
waste
is
more
costly
to
dispose
of,
the
mere
fact
that
the
higher
fee
on
such
waste
purports
to
be
cost-based
does
not
render
the
fee
non-discriminatory.
respondent,
agencies
of
the
state
of
oregon,
have
failed
to
justify
that
discrimination.
wastes
from
other
states
are
identical
in
all
material
respects
to
oregon
waste.
respondents'
suggestion
that
the
state
has
a
valid
interest
in
conferring
an
economic
advantage
on
those
who
handle
oregon
waste
is
in
odds
with
the
very
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
which
is
to
break
down
protections
of
barriers
to
the
free
flow
of
interstate
trade.
although
respondent's
claim
that
a
higher
fee
must
be
imposed
on
out
of
state
wastes
to
compensate
for
the
general
in-state
taxes
that
oregon
citizens
pay
to
ward
the
state?s
waste
reduction
activities,
respondents
have
not
identified
a
specific
tax
burden
imposed
on
oregon
citizens
that
is
comparable
and
kind
and
agreed
to
the
higher
fee
on
out
of
state
waste.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
