justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
taranto,
in
the
chronology
of
these
proceedings,
what
was
the
last
point
at
which
these
respondents
or
other
persons
in
their
position
could
object
to
the
certification
of
the
class?
was
the
issue
of
miscertification
open
to
them
at
all
points?
at
what
point
were
they
barred
from
rearguing
the
certification
of
the
class?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
your
view
of
the
case,
under
your
submission,
when
was
the
last
point
at
which
these
respondents
could
have
asked
the
class
be
recertified
or
objected
to
the
miscertification
of
the
class?
sometime
before
our
decision
in
southern
motor
carriers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
any
time
before
final
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
there
an
argument,
assuming
you
lose
on
the
constitutional
aspect
of
the
case,
that
the
court's
ruling
is
res
judicata
as
to
your
clients
on
this
point,
that
you
could
have
objected
to
the
certification,
or
the
miscertification?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
attorney
general
had
been
recognized
as
parens
patriae,
would
you
still
have
had
a
constitutional
opt-out
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
not,
under
your
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
the
attorney
general
in
any
better
stead--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--than
someone
who
is
certified
as
being
an
adequate
representative
after
an
adversary
hearing
in
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
don't
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
drop
out
of
a
suit
where
the
attorney
general
is
acting
parens
patriae?
