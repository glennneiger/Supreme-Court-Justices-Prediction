mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
to
insist
that
certain
claims
be
litigated
all
at
once
in
a
single
federal
class
action,
rather
than
through
numerous
repetitive
and
possibly
inconsistent
lawsuits.
our
position
is,
first,
that
there
is
no
due
process
bar
to
this
useful
procedure
where,
as
is
no
longer
disputed
in
this
case,
the
class
action
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
class
and
the
interests
of
the
class
members
were
fairly
represented.
where
those
conditions
are
met,
the
choice
whether
to
have
a
mandatory
class
action
for
particular
kinds
of
claim
should
remain
only
a
matter
of
policy,
including
where
monetary
claims
are
at
stake,
and
second,
even
if
the
constitution
requires
more
than
the
interest
in
avoiding
multiple
suits
to
justify
mandatory
class
action,
such
as
the
interest
reflected
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
of
current
rule
23,
those
additional
interests
are
present
in
this
case.
now,
if
i
can
put
aside
the
question
of
personal
jurisdiction,
which
is
now
conceded
here,
i
want
to
begin
with
the
relevant
history
as
to
class
actions.
that
history
has
two
aspects,
the
first--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
that
as
a
constitutional
matter,
it
is
permissible
for
the
rulemakers
or
for
congress
to
decide
that
once
the
conditions
of
numerosity
and
adequate
representation
are
fully
guaranteed,
that
the
interests
in
having
a
single
mandatory
class
and
therefore
denying
opt-out
rights
are
constitutionally
sufficient,
necessarily
notwithstanding
the
desire
of
certain
individuals
to
pursue
their
own
litigation,
and
i
think,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
that
is
in
fact
consistent
with
the
history
of
this
court's
treatment
and
the
evolution
of
the
rules.
this
court
has,
beginning
in
the
1854
case
of
smith,
on
through
the
insurance
benefit
cases
in
the
early
decades
of
this
century,
then
on
through
hansberry
v.
lee
and
later
cases,
always
identified
adequacy
of
representation
as
the
constitutional
benchmark,
and
some
of
those
cases,
notably
the
insurance
cases,
specifically
involve
monetary
claims
where
in
some
sense
(b)(3)
in
current
terms
might
have
been
available
for
certain
people
who
wanted
to
opt
out.
what
the
court
has
never
done
is
to
declare
the
particular
circumstances
where
mandatory
class
actions
have
been
permitted
are
the
only
ones
where
that
is
constitutionally
so,
and
in
particular,
the
one
sentence
in
shutts,
phillips
petroleum
v.
shutts,
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on,
doesn't
do
that,
because
shutts
is
only
about
the
prerequisites
for
personal
jurisdiction.
the
second
aspect
of
the
history
that
i
think
is
important
here
is
precisely
the
evolution
of
choices
about
when
mandatory
classes
are
appropriate.
one
set
of
choices
is,
of
course,
embodied
in
the
current
rule
23.
another
set
of
choices
is
currently
under
consideration
by
the
advisory
committee.
an
earlier
set
of
choices
was
embodied
in
the
original
1938
rules,
and
still
before
that,
before
the
rules
in
1938,
there
was
a
wide
variety
of
opinion
among
all
sorts
of
courts
about
when
mandatory
class
actions
were
appropriate
with...
and
the
important
point
about
that
variety
of
opinion
and
the
evolution
of
choices
is
that
the
debate
has
always
been
on
nonconstitutional
grounds,
insofar
as
relevant
today.
there
was
once
a
jury
trial
issue,
but
that's
not
any
longer
a
live
issue
after
the
merger
of
law
and
equity.
so
what
the
history
i
think
stands
for
is
precisely
flexibility
as
a
policy
matter
about
when
the
interests
in
consolidating
all
actions
in
a
single
proceeding
override
any
remaining
individual
interest,
and
that
flexibility
i
think
is
perfectly
correct
under
the
prevailing
due
process
analysis
of
mathews
v.
eldridge.
the
reasons
for
mandatory
class
actions
derive
from
the
basic
defining
characteristic
of
numerosity.
where
that
is
present,
there
are
strong
interests
in
avoiding
costly,
repetitive,
possibly
inconsistent
results,
and
these
interests
have
a
number
of
overlapping
aspects
that
can
appear
in
different
mixes
in
different
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
in
the
sense
that
courts
of
appeals
review
certification
decisions
under
a
fairly
deferential
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
i
think
a
certification
under
(b)(3)
rather
than
under
(b)(1)
or
(b)(2)
where
those
conditions
are
met
can
in
fact
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
one
of
the
points
that
has
been
made
by
many
courts
is
that
(b)(3)
is
a
kind
of
catch-all
provision,
and
most
cases
that
would
properly
fall
under
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
could
also
come
within
(b)(3),
and
the
structure
of
the
rules
therefore
suggest
that
there
will
be
some
cases
that
really
should
be
categorized
under
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2).
there
are
cases,
and
i
think
this
is
properly
one,
in
which
at
a
minimum
it
was
proper
to
certify
the
case
under
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2).
whether
the
certification
was
so
clearly
proper
under
those
standards
that
certifying
it
under
(b)(3)
instead
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion,
i
don't
know.
of
course,
if
this
had
been
certified
under
(b)(3),
this
whole
constitutional
issue
would
not
in
fact
have
arisen,
because
then
opt-out
rights
would
have
been
provided
in
the
original
lawsuit.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i
think
that
the
analysis
that
would
have
to
be
followed
would
be
a
mathews
v.
eldridge
analysis,
and
i'm,
as
i'm
standing
here,
uncertain
what
kind
of
weighty
state
interest
there
might
be
in
saying
that
any
particular
individual
has
no
right
to
choose
an
individual's
own
lawyer.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i
think...
no.
no,
i
don't--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think
that
what
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
analysis
does
provide
for
is
the
change
from
earlier,
the
traditionally
established
ways
of
proceeding.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
the
kinds
of
cases
that
have
been
permitted
as
mandatory
class
actions
under
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
since
1966
have
extended
beyond--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--(b)(1)
and
(b)--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--but
the
history
in
particular
of
monetary
claims,
and
it
does
go
back
to
1854,
it's
a
little--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
don'
think
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
if
the
question
is
as
a
constitutional
matter,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
yes.
i
think
that
rulemakers
or
congress
could
determine
that,
if
the
issues
are
truly
common,
so
that
any
particular
interest
is
in
fact
adequately
being
represented,
then
a
mass
tort
case
could
constitutionally
be
consolidated
in
a
single
proceeding.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
is...
mass
tort
cases
are
commonly
treated
under
(b)(3),
not
under
(b)(2).
there
is
an
increasing
development
to
treat
at
least
some
aspects
of
mass
tort
cases,
maybe
even
all
of
them,
under
(b)(1),
under
(b)(1)(b),
which
is
roughly
speaking
about
limited
funds,
where
the
assets
of
the
defendant
would...
might
well
be
exhausted
by
tens
of
thousands
of
tort
suits,
and
then
the
traditional
limited
fund
justification
comes
in.
but
let
me
return
if
i
may
for
1
minute,
it
is
true
that
this
court
has
not...
had
not
had
to
deal
with
a
class
action,
a
mandatory
class
action
outside
some
broad
view
of
what
a
limited
fund
is,
but
other
courts
did
in
fact
deal
with
such
cases,
and
if
one
looks
at
some
of
the
prior
history,
prior
to
1938,
some
of
the
cases
discussed
in
the
influential
articles
by
professor
chafee,
i
think
what
that
shows
is
that
various
courts
were
in
fact
treating
the
avoidance
of
multiple
litigation
as,
by
itself,
a
sufficient
interest
to
have
a
single,
mandatory
proceeding.
so
there
is,
in
fact,
some
historical
precedent
for
this,
though
admittedly
not
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
i
think
in--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
with
respect
to
a
federal
statutory
claim,
there
probably
is
an
additional
congressional
power
to,
in
effect,
condition
the
kinds
of
proceedings
in
which
certain
kinds
of
claims
created
by
congress
can
be
brought.
this
case,
of
course,
is
one
in
which
we
do
have
a
federal
statutory
claim,
but
i
do
think
that
as
a
constitutional
due
process
matter
the
point
extends
further,
and
the
basic
reason
is,
aside
from
the
fact
that
i
think
the
history
is
relatively
open
on
the
subject
and
precisely
allows
flexibility
of
choice,
is
that
what's
on
the
individual
side
of
the
balance
is
an
interest
in
controlling
one's
own
litigation
to
ensure
against
incorrect
adjudication
or
unfair
compromise.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
think
this
court's--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
i
think
that's
right,
but
what
congress
has
done
in
a
number
of
contexts
is
to
say,
in
particular
when
an
administrative
agency
makes
a
ruling,
sets
prices,
for
example,
under
the
price
administration
regime
of
world
war
ii,
that
there
shall
be
one
forum
at
one
time
in
which
that
can
be
challenged,
and
if...
i
assume
there
are
hundreds
of
such
challenges
brought
within
the
30
days
in
the
d.c.
circuit
or
the
emergency
court
of
appeals.
there
is
going
to
be,
necessarily,
some
kind
of
consolidated,
representative
proceeding
in
which
that
claim
will
be
heard.
what
the
mandatory
class
action
device
does
is
essentially
mirror
that
kind
of
consolidated
proceeding
where
the
justification
of
numerosity
calls
for
it.
now,
many
different
choices,
i
think
are
permissible
about
when
that
can...
that
ought
to
be
done,
and
the
current
rules
clearly
do
weigh
different
interests
somewhat
differently.
the
interests
that
are
present
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
are
interests
that
the
rulemakers
deem
somewhat
greater
of
greater
weight
than
the
interest
present
in
what...
in
the
residual
(b)(3)
category.
in
addition
to
the
shear
burden
of
multiple
litigation,
there
are
the
additional
interests
of
avoiding
inconsistent
obligations
or
the
so-called
cohesion
interests
that
respondents
refer
to.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
so.
i
mean,
the...
rule
23
does
not
itself
determine
the
preclusive
effect
of
judgments.
it
plainly
was
intended
to
provide
that
everybody
included
within
the
judgment
shall
be
bound
by
the
judgment
but
does
not
itself
lay
down
the
preclusion
rules.
the
preclusion
rules
continue,
by
and
large,
to
be
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
and
those
rules,
if
one
looks
at
the
restatement
or
this
court's
cases,
basically
say
that
a
representative
action
where
adequacy
of
representation
is
guaranteed
shall
have
preclusive
effect.
there
are
certain
elements
of
discretion
embodied
in
those
rules,
but
in
general
the
finality
and
efficiency
purposes
that
preclusion
rules
are
designed
to
serve
do
in
fact
require
a
certain
measure
of
clarity
as
to
those
standards
as
well,
and
therefore
the
discretion
as
to
preclusion
is
relatively
minimal,
though
there
is
a
genuine
important
judgment
to
be
made
about
when
the
representation
was
truly
adequate.
now,
that
judgment,
of
course,
was
made
in
this
case.
the
principal
challenge
to
the
binding
effect
of
the
philadelphia
class
action
in
this
case
was
a
challenge
based
on
adequate
representation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
first,
i
think
that
that
would
necessarily
present
a
question
about
adequacy
of
representation
that
is
not
presented
in
his
court,
but
second,
i
think
in
this
particular
case
that
would
not
make
sense.
if
one
puts
oneself
back
in
the
framework
of
1985
and
1986,
and
looks
in
particular
at
the
dispute
over
whether
arizona
and
wisconsin
and
certain
other
states
were
different
in
relevant
respects
from
the
other
states
affected
by
the
class,
i
think
it
is
very
hard
to
question
the
judgment
of
not
only
adequate
but
in
fact
quite
vigorous
representation.
recall,
back
in
'85,
within
3
months
of
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit,
this
court
decided
the
southern
motor
carriers
case,
suddenly
creating
a
much
more
substantial...
indeed,
what
the
district
court
in
philadelphia
thought,
a
pretty
clearly
winning
state
action
defense
on
antitrust
grounds.
there
is
also
the
mccarran-ferguson
question,
which
has
still
not
been
finally
resolved
in
this
case.
those
are
questions
that,
of
course,
have
taken
the
ftc
9
years
to
litigate,
and
the
judgment
is
still
not
final
as
to
them.
beyond
those
two
questions
there
is
at
least
the
question,
not
present
in
the
ftc
case,
of
seeking
damages,
and
where
damages
are
alleged,
there
would
be
the
additional
burden
of
establishing
that,
even
if
the
participation
in
the
rating
bureaus
was
illegal
under
the
antitrust
laws,
that
the
resulting
rates
were
higher
than
what
they
would
have
been
in
a
purely
competitive
system.
and
with
respect
to
all
of
those
factors,
what
judge
van
artsdellon
decided,
and
what
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
decided,
was
that
there
really
were
no
concrete
appreciable
differences
between
arizona
and
wisconsin
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
other
states
on
the
other.
and
whatever
differences
there
may
have
been
were
so
outweighed
by
the
prospect
of
9
years
of
additional
litigation,
all
for
the
prospect
of
possibly
no
damages
at
the
end
of
the
day,
that
it
was
a
perfectly
reasonable,
responsible
choice
of
a
vigorous
advocate
to
say,
we
will
settle
for
the
following
sorts
of
injunctive
relief,
some
of
which
is
retrospective,
in
the
sense
that
it
provides
additional
insurance
benefits
to
all
members
of
the
class,
and
so
i
think
in
this
particular
case
there
really
is
no
ground
for
deciding
that
some
higher
level
of
representative
adequacy
is
necessary.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i
think
it
is
important
to
separate
the
question
of
adequacy
of
representation
leading
to
an
adjudicated
decision
and
adequacy
of
representation
leading
to
a
settlement,
although
the
two
are
necessarily,
in
practical
terms,
interlinked.
here,
i
think,
in
fact
both
of
those
that
the
representation
was
perfectly
adequate
as
to
both,
just
as
i
think
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
to
certify
this
particular
class
under
both
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2),
and
(b)(1),
the
critical
point
is...
what
(b)(1)
says
is
that
we
should
certify
a
class
if
there's
a
risk
of
varying
inconsistent
or
varying
adjudications.
and
what
that
has
been
used
for
time
and
again
are
cases
not
simply
in
which
the
defendant
might
be
told
by
one
court
to
do
something
and
another
court
to
do
precisely
the
opposite,
but
rather
for
a
whole
range
of
circumstances
involving
government
benefits
and
other
kinds
of
situations
where
the
defendant
has
some
kind
of
legal
obligation
to
act
consistently
toward
all
the
plaintiff
class.
here,
the
defendants
do
have
that
obligation,
and
they
have
that
obligation
not
only
prospectively
in
terms
of
the
rates
that
they
would
charge
or
their
behavior
in
establishing
insurance
rates
within
a
particular
state,
but
retrospectively
as
well,
because
any
damages
that
would
be
paid
would
in
effect
create
a
retroactive
rate,
and
all
the...
all
the
state
regulatory
regimes
here
declare
that
there
shall
not
be
discrimination
through
all
of
the
writs.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
there
were
a
dozen
complaints,
eventually
reduced
to,
i
think,
nine.
some
of
them
asked
for
(b)(3),
some
of
them
did
not
specify.
they
simply
said,
under
rule
23.
i
think
four
of
the
complaints
did
not
specify
what
subsection
they
were
seeking
to
proceed
under.
that
would,
though,
however,
have
been
quite
dramatically
changed
by
this
court's
decision
in
southern
motor
carriers,
because
by
the
time
the
ftc
brought
its
action
in
early
1985,
and
these
actions
were
then
filed
literally
within
days
of
the
ftc
action,
the
participation
in
the
rating
bureaus
was
by
and
large
over,
so
in
that
sense,
at
that
time,
they
were
mostly
looking
for
retrospective
relief.
what
southern
motor
carriers
did
was
suddenly,
in
a
very
real
sense,
to
raise
the
prospect
of
future
participation
in
rating
bureaus
being
permitted.
there
was
now
something
very
much
forward-looking
to
think
about,
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
very
much
a
weaker
claim
for
any
kind
of
retrospective
relief,
so--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think
that
if
the
question
of
certification
is
not
a
constitutional
one,
then
i
think
the
question
of
certification
is
not
open
in
a
separate
collateral
suit.
these
particular
plaintiffs,
as
well
as
the
various
attorneys
general
who
pursued
this
interest
in
the
philadelphia
action,
were
entitled
to,
and
did,
press
the
question
of
certification
in
that
action
and
took
an
appeal
and
eventually
cert
was
denied.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
certification
standards
of
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
become
constitutionalized,
and
it
becomes
a
matter
of
due
process
right
to
have
an
opt-out
opportunity
in
those
circumstances
where
one
can
only
be
in
(b)(3)
but
not
in
those
circumstances
where
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
are
appropriate,
then
at
least
i
think
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
how
the
certification
question,
now
constitutionalized,
wouldn't
be
open
on
collateral
attack.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
they
could
have
made
the
argument
about
certification
at
any
time
in
the
philadelphia
proceeding
before
there
was
a
final
judgment.
i
think
the
argument
would
have,
in
fact--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
i
think
so,
and
indeed,
that
issue
was
taken
up
to
the
third
circuit
eventually
on
certiorari,
but
one
reason
i
think
that,
aside
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
were
found
to
be
present
and
have
not
been
challenged
in
this
court,
and
i
think
were
quite
proper
because
of
the
need
for
uniformity
in
the
treatment
by
defendants
of
all
of
their
consumers,
even
aside
from
that,
i
think
one
important
reason
why
the
current
rule
23
categories
shouldn't
be
constitutionalized
any
more
than
the
original
1938
rule
23
category
should
be
constitutionalized,
is
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
agree
that
the
argument
the
other
side
is
making
is
that
due
process
requires
an
opt-out
right
either
for
all
monetary
claimants
or
for
some
monetary
claimants.
what
i
think
has
not
been
contested
and
certainly
was
not
contested
in
the
lower
courts
is
whether
the
conditions
laid
out
for
mandatory
treatment
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
are
present
here.
it
has
never
been
disputed
that
this
was
properly
certified
under
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2).
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
that
is
a
reasonable
policy
choice,
but
it's
not
constitutionally
required,
because
monetary
claims
have
always...
some
monetary
claims
have
always--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
the
current
rule...
i
think
it
is
possible
to
interpret
the
current
rules
as
making
that
policy
choice.
i
think
it
is
also
possible
to
interpret
them
otherwise.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
except
that
the
construction
of
the
rule
has
not
in
fact
been
litigated
in
this
particular
case.
it
has
never
been
disputed
in
this
case
that
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
were
proper,
and--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--as
a
constitutional
matter
they
have
made
an
argument
that
adequate
representation
is
not
present,
and
that
due
process
under
shutts
always
requires
monetary
claims
to
be
separated
out,
which
it
plainly
cannot
do
in
(b)(1),
and
i
don't
think
it
needs
to
in
(b)(2)
either,
and
even
if
it
were...
that
were
true
under
(b)(2)
as
a
matter
of
interpreting
the
rule,
i
don't
think
it's
true
as
a
constitutional
matter.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
that
is
an
argument
that
was
made
in
the
philadelphia
proceeding,
can
be
made
under
the
rules,
but
the
constitutional
question
is
whether
that
categories
that
are
laid
out
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
and
(b)(3),
highly
imprecise
as
they
are,
must
be
present
as
a
constitutional
matter.
