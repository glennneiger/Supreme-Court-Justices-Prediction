is
it
possible
to
argue
that
that's
the
policy
choice
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
entire
rule
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we
interpret
the
current
rule
as
having
made
that
policy
choice,
we
wouldn't...
and
if
we
agreed
with
your
opponent,
having
made
that
policy
choice,
then
we
wouldn't
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
we
would
reverse
on
a
construction
of
the
rule,
wouldn't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
has
it
not
been
disputed
that...
whether
you
could
recover
damages,
whether
that
would
foreclose
the
damage
claim?
haven't
they
contended
right
along
that
the
certification,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
is
only
good
for
equitable
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
north,
you
said
that
the
attorney
generals
were
not
appearing
as
parens
patriae
for
the
citizens
of
the
state
at
the
time.
were
they
asserting
damage
claims
on
behalf
of
the
state
institutions
they
represented?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
but
they
were
denied
the
right
to
assert
damage
claims
at
the
time
of
the
class
certification
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
north,
am
i
not
correct
that
you
argued
that
the
notice
was
not
only
inadequate
as
a
constitutional
matter,
but
was
inadequate
under
the
rules,
because
it
was
the
equivalent
of
a
(b)(3)
action--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
judge
responded
by
saying
all
the
damage
claims
are
dropped
so
the
notice
by
publication
is
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
argued
not
only
constitutional
inadequacy
of
notice,
but
inadequate
under
the
rules.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
