mr.
taranto,
i
hope
in
your
history
you
will
cover
whether
you
think
(b)(2)
and
(b)(3)
classifications
are
interchangeable
so
that
if
you
have
a
group
where
some
might
prefer
the
(b)(3)
class,
that
is,
making
compensatory
damages
the
thing,
and
others
are
content
with
the
(b)(2)
classification,
a
court
can
nonetheless
force
on
the
people
who
might
prefer
the
(b)(3)
class
the
one
in
which
you
cannot
opt
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
if
it's
your
view
that
if
the
district
judge
here
had
determined
that
(b)(3)
was
the
appropriate
mode
for
this,
that
that
would
also
be
all
right,
that
this
is
totally
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
initial
trier?
if
he
styles
this
a
(b)(2)
class,
then
that's
okay,
but
equally,
it
wouldn't
have
been
wrong,
would
it,
for
the
trial
judge
to
have
said,
this
case
i
think
belongs
under
the
(b)(3)
mold,
and
there
should
be
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
opt
out,
because
some
people
might
prefer
compensatory
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
a
mass
tort...
a
plane
crash,
a
railroad
disaster?
could
you
bring
that
as
a
mandatory
(b)(2),
and
then
after
you
settle
the
liability,
just
have
individual
hearings
on
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
a
mass
tort
case
in
fact
isn't,
so
it
remains
an
academic
question.
is
it
not
so
that
you
might
get
a
(b)(3)
but
you
would
not
get
a
(b)(2)
class
certified?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
this
class
originally...
wasn't
there
a
question
in
the
complaint
originally
for
(b)(3)
certification?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
taranto,
are
you
saying
that
no
one
of
the
other
side
is
claiming
that
it
was
wrong
to
make
this
a
mandatory
class
as
distinguished
from
a
class...
from
a
(b)(3)
class
in
which
people
can
opt
out?
i
thought
that
was
what
the
case
was
about
on
the
other
side,
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
here
to
notice,
and
an
opportunity
to
opt
out,
and
that
was...
it
was
wrong
for
the
district
judge
in
philadelphia
to
preclude
that,
and
it
remains
wrong,
and
that
it's
a
matter
of
due
process.
i
thought
that
was
the
very
argument
the
other
side
was
making.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
one
take
the
position,
so
far,
yes,
as
far
as
injunctive
relief
is
concerned,
the
class
is
delighted
with
that,
but
you
can't
cut
out
the
damage
remedy
without
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
have
notice,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
our
own.
that
is,
to
accept
the
mandatory
class
for
purposes
of
injunctive
relief,
but
not
for
purposes
of
cutting
out
compensatory
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
follows
that
for
the
monetary
claims
the
people
who
would
like
to
press
such
claims
can't
be
taken
out,
then
the
label
that
you
put
on
it,
then
you
say
well,
to
that
extent
it
belongs
under
(b)(3),
but
the
claims
don't
come
into
court
with
some
kind
of
magic
label
ahead
of
time.
if
you
decide
that
there
is...
that
the
damage
claim
is
something
that
can't
be
cut
out
because
some
people
in
the
group
like
it
that
way
better
than
others,
then
the
classification
is
under
(b)(3).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
isn't
the
argument
the
deal
that
was
made
in
the
mdl
cases
the
group
adequately
represented
decided
to
surrender
its
claims
for
monetary
relief
in
exchange
for
these
5(c)
equitable
type
remedies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
concede
that
there
are
class
actions
that
would
fit
in
the
(b)(1)
or
the
(b)(2)
category
where
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
individual
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
opt
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
example,
for
injunctive
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
taranto
brought
up
the
limited
fund
case
as
a
case
that
you
could
proceed,
where
you
could
force...
you
could
have
a
mandatory
class,
force
everyone
into
the
forum
to
get
pieces
of
this
very
limited
pie.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was...
there
were
representatives
that
were
designated
to
represent
the
entire
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were...
purported
representatives.
at
least,
they
were
certified
as
such.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
said
something
about
notice.
the
mullane
case
on
which
you
rely
doesn't
require
that
every
person
in
the
class
get
notice
in
order
to
bind
them
to
the
adjudication,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
had
to
get
first
class
mail
notice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
talking
about
a
different
settlement
now,
and
maybe--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
can
you
tell
us
at
what
stage
that
is...
you...
i
forgot,
now,
which
side
moved
to
dismiss
the
petition
for
cert
because
you
were
pursuing
settlement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how...
what
is
the
projected
timetable
for
when
that
settlement
agreement
will
be...
final
order
will
be
entered
in
the
district
court
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
because
it's
a
notice
of
a
class
settlement
you'd
have
to
give
notice--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
opportunity
to
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
it's
conceivable
that
a
judgment
by
this
court
might
have
an
effect
on
those
pending
settlement--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--proposals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
questioning
that
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
actions
that
the
rule
framers
meant
those
to
be
binding
on
all
members
of
the
class,
like
it
or
not?
