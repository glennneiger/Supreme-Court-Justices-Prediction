chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
92-1988,
the
ticor
title
insurance
company
v.
walter
thomas
brown
and
jeffrey
dziewit.
mr.
taranto.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
congress
could
repeal
outright
any
private
claim
of
antitrust
for
antitrust
liability
against
a
defendant,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
couldn't
it
do
this
lesser
thing
of
requiring
a
certain
degree
of
consolidation
take
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
mr.
north,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
would
you
state
your
nonconstitutional
argument
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
is
the
law
of
judgments
and--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--estoppel
by
judgment,
that
sort
of
thing,
that
you're
urging
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
north,
the
question
which
we
granted
certiorari
is
whether
a
federal
court
may
refuse
to
enforce
the
judgment
in
nationwide
class
actions
certified
under
rule
23
on
the
ground
that
unnamed
class
members
have
a
constitutional
right
to
opt
out
of
any
class
action
asserting
monetary
claims.
now,
your
argument
here
is
directed
to
really
what
is
an
alternate
ground
for
affirmance,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
i
hope
you'll
cover
that
in
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
reasonable
people
could
disagree,
i
think,
about
your
reading
of
the
shutts
opinion
as
to
whether
it's
dealing
with
personal
jurisdiction
or
procedural
due
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
shutts
could
be
about
the
jurisdictional
requirements
for
state
courts
dealing
with
these
sort
of
things
as
opposed
to
federal
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
people
who
did
have...
from
what
you
say,
i
gather
some
people
did
have
actual
notice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mullane
was
dealing
with
an
existing
property
right
and
a
trust.
i'm
not
sure
that
carries
over
bag
and
baggage
into
the
plaintiff's
notification
in
a
class
action
suit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say...
several
times
you've
said,
in
many
cases.
now,
is
it
a
fact
that
some
people
other
than
the
attorney
general
of
arizona,
who
are
simply
private
plaintiffs,
did
have
actual
notice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
north.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
93-1988,
ticor
title
insurance
company
versus
brown.
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
it
is
ordered
that
the
writ
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
i
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
