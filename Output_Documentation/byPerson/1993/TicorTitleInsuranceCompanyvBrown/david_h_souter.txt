mr.
taranto,
given
the
reflection
of
those
interests,
if
you're
right
on
due
process,
does
a
court
have
any
discretion
in
applying
preclusion
rules?
in
other
words
if
we
were
to
say,
sure,
there's
no
due
process
problem
in
your
position,
does
that...
does
that
leave
a
court
with
any
opportunity
to
hear
a
claim
simply
based
on
the
inappropriateness
of
applying
preclusion
in
a
given
case,
given
the
fact
that
the
preclusion
rules
themselves
embody
a...
ultimately
a
flexible,
a
kind
of
an
equitable
circuit
breaker
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
would
it
make
any
sense
to
conclude
here
that
the
representation
was
adequate,
again
so
far
as
any
due
process
standard
might
be
concerned.
it
was
certainly
adequate
in
the
sense
of
competence,
but
that
there
was
in
fact
at
least
a
sufficient
disparity
of
interest
between,
we'll
say,
the
intending
arizona
plaintiffs
here,
so
that
for
res
judicata
purposes
we
would
not
apply
preclusion
against
them.
would
that...
is
there
any
way
that
would
make
sense?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
suppose
it
would
follow
from
what
you
say
that
it
would
at
least
be
constitutionally
open
to
provide
a
trial
regime
in
which
a
court
could
conclude
that
one
were...
that
a
given
plaintiff
was
not
subject
to
a
summary
judgment
motion,
and
was
not
subject
to
a
dismissal
motion,
but
on
grounds
of
unlikelihood
of
success,
in
effect
could
suffer
a
dismissal,
because
that
in
effect
is
the
standard
by
which
you
are
judging,
or
i
think
you
were
judging
the
reasonableness
of
the
decision
that
was
made
about
the
adequate
representation
of
those
who
wanted
to
go
all
the
way
for
damages,
or
at
least
claimed
they
did.
