justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taranto,
can...
do
you
think
a
state
or
congress
could
establish
a
system
in
which
you
no
longer
have
the
choice
of
your
own
lawyer
to
prosecute
causes
of
action,
saying,
you
know,
lawyers
have
gotten
too
expensive,
we're
going
to
establish
a
career
attorney
system,
and
you
simply
get
assigned
your
lawyer
when
you
want
to
vindicate
some
civil
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
should
just
be
expense
of
attorneys.
but
that's
how
you'd
approach
it.
every...
despite
the
fact
that
we've
had
a
tradition
that
you
can
pick
your
own
lawyer
in
the
past,
it's
an
open
question,
and
you
simply
balance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
elimination
of
that
historic
right
against...
against
the
utility
to
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
does
what
you're
proposing.
i
mean,
the
cases
that
you've
mentioned
are
cases
that
involve
either
equity
or
limited
funds,
the
historic
cases,
so
this
is
really
a
new
proposal.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
consider--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
i'm
sorry,
i
have
a
warped
timeframe.
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
due
process
clause
is
concerned
i
consider
1966
recent.
[laughter]
175
years
too
late.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
goes
back
to
that
date
in
a
very
different
context,
where
you
have
a
limited
fund.
everybody
can't
possibly
get
it,
and
maybe
you
could
extend
that
to
the
situation
where
defendant
is
likely
to
be
bankrupted
by
too
many
private
claims,
and
i
suppose
that
would
be
analogous,
but
where
that
isn't...
where
that
isn't
in
the
cards,
or
there's
no
indication
of
that,
and
the
only
problem
is
there
are
a
lot
of
lawsuits,
i
think
that's
pretty
new.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taranto,
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
surely
doesn't
suggest
that
simply
because
congress
can
eliminate
a
claim
entirely
it
can
provide
for
that
claim
to
be
tried
with
any
process
whatever?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
one
doesn't
necessarily
include
the
other.
if
you
allow
the
claim
to
subsist,
there
are
certain
process
requirements
for
its
trial
that
apply
nonetheless.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
north,
assuming
you're
right
about
this,
that
you
had
to
be
given
a
right
to
opt
out,
why
didn't
you
have
to
assert
that
right
in
the
original
litigation?
why
didn't
you
have
to
assert
that
right
in
the
third
circuit,
when
that
mdl
case
was
appealed
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
really
understand
what
happens
in
parens
patriae,
since
you
say
if
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
suing
in
that
capacity
wins,
everybody
benefits,
but
if
he
loses,
those
who
didn't
get,
what,
first
class
notice
so
that
they
can
opt
out,
can
nonetheless
sue
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
asking.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
asserted
that
there
is
a
right
to
opt
out
in
parens
patriae
cases
as
well,
right?
you
did
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
the
class...
assuming
the
class
loses
here,
would
they
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
lawyers
who
did
that
to
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
opposite
result
is
more
likely.
that
is,
that
the
settlement
will
affect
the
decision
of
this
court,
rather
than
that
the
decision
of
the
court
will
affect
the
settlement.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
north,
just
so
i'm
sure
about
the
state
of
the
law,
your
opponent
cannot
cite
common
law
cases,
by
which
i
mean
pre-1966
cases,
in
which...
in
which
actions
of
this
sort
were
brought
for
money
damages,
but
on
the
other
hand,
you
cannot
cite
any
in
which
such
actions
were
denied.
am
i
correct?
i
mean,
you
point
out
that
there
are
no
bills
of
peace
allowed
for
money
damages,
class
actions
for
money
damages,
but
you
don't
have
any
cases
where
that
was
sought
to
be
done
and
the
court
said
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm...
you
can
answer
that
question
standing
there.
do
you
know
of
any?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
