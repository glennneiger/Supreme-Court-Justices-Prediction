mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
there
is
a
nonconstitutional
basis
for
deciding
this
case,
and
it
has
been
asserted,
it
was
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
it's
been
argued
here.
it
stems,
however,
not
from
whether
the
certification
in
mdl
633
was
itself
proper,
but
whether
the
judgment
below,
in
determining
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
judgment,
was
proper.
what
actually
occurred
in
mdl
633,
and
the
record
is
quite
clear,
is
the
cases
both
as
individually
filed
and--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--yes.
the
damage
claims
that
were
purportedly
foreclosed
in
mdl
633
could
not
have
been
asserted
there
in
the
proceeding
as
it
was
constituted
in
that
court.
therefore,
there
was
never
an
opportunity
for
these
plaintiffs
to
litigate
that
issue.
no
proceeding
has
a
preclusive
effect
with
respect
to
issues
that
could
not
have
been
litigated,
and
i'd
add
that
since
these
were
absent
plaintiffs,
we
have
no
splitting
of
cause
of
action
type
problem.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
precisely.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
exactly.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
well,
the
problem
is...
there's
a
small
procedural
problem,
but
the
reality,
if
i
can
begin
with
that...
the
reality
of
what
occurred
is
this.
the
cases
as
filed
all
sought
treble
damages
and
were
predominantly
for
money
damages
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
only
incidentally
was
injunctive
relief
sought,
because
as
my
opponent
has
pointed
out,
there
was
nothing
left
to
enjoin.
all
the
rating
bureaus
had
already
been
disbanded.
class
counsel
during
the
proceeding
decided
not
to
pursue
the
treble
damage
claims
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
mdl
633
proceeding,
and
the
district
court
below
in
this
case
concluded
that
those
claims
had
been
dropped,
and
that
is
the
language
those
courts
used.
the
claims
were
dropped.
instead,
without
ever
filing
a
new
case,
injunctive
claims
were
asserted,
and
the
case
was
settled
in
a
manner
that
both
courts
deemed
primarily
or
literally
exclusively
injunctive
in
nature.
in
the
process
of
settling
the
case,
the
class
attorneys
who
had
declined
to
continue
to
represent
the
damage
cause
of
action
traded
it
to
settle
the
injunction
case.
that
was
improper.
there
was
never
an
opportunity
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
either
to
litigate
their
damage
case
in
mdl
633
or
to
exclude
themselves
from
that
and
pursue
those
claims.
we
know
the
claims
were
substantial.
mdl
633
in
the
approval
decision
itself
called
them
tens
of
millions
of
dollars,
and
we
know
because
this
case
was
already
settled,
that
these
particular
claimants
had
substantial
damage
claims
in
the
millions
of
dollars.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
we
were
absent
parties
in
the
case,
so
we
never
really
had
an
opportunity
to
object,
and
frankly,
since
there
was
no
first
class
mail
notice,
merely
notice
by
publication,
i
think
mullane
would
bar
that
kind
of
an
argument.
these
plaintiffs
never
even
knew
this
was
going
on.
they
never
had
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
object.
yes,
the
attorney
general
of
arizona
and
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
objected,
but
they
were
never
accepted
by
the
mdl
633
court
in
a
parens
patriae
capacity,
only
in
their
capacity
as
representing
the
state
and
its
subdivisions,
which
also
had
a
damage
interest.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
it
is,
although
that
we
do
argue
that
the
answer
to
the
certified
question
is
that
yes,
the
district
court
most
certainly
can
refuse
to
give
preclusive
effect,
and
we
believe
this
court's
decision
in
shutts
establishes
that.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
i
will
right
away,
if
i
may.
shutts
has
been
argued,
and
we
were
guilty
of
this
below
as
well,
to
some
extent,
in
terms
of
personal
jurisdiction
by
many,
many
courts
and
many
parties,
but
when
it
is
read
in
light
of
its
predecessor
decision,
hansberry
v.
lee,
it
can't
mean
that.
the
basic
principle
that's
at
issue
here
is
the
principle
that
parties
that
are
not...
persons
who
are
not
party
to
a
lawsuit
may
not
be
bound
by
a
judgment
entered
in
that
litigation,
and
that
an
attempt
to
enforce
such
a
judgment
against
such
a
person
is
violative
of
both
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments,
and
that
is
in
the
critical
paragraph
spanning
pages
40
to
41
of
hansberry
v.
lee.
so
we
already
know
that
there
is
a
principle
that
is
equally
applicable
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
the
question
is
the
exception
to
the
basic
principle,
which
is
what
our
opponents
urge.
they
urge
the
exception
which
is
the
class
case.
hansberry
v.
lee,
and
subsequently
this
court's
decision
in
shutts,
sets
out
the
minimal
procedural
due
process
protections
that
are
required
for
that
exception
for
class
representation
type
litigation
to
overcome
the
more
basic
principle.
those
protections
were
not
accorded
here.
there
was
no
right
to
opt
out.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
reasonable
people
have
disagreed,
so
the
answer
must
be
that
they
could,
but
the
truth
is...
the
truth
is
that
it
doesn't
stand
analysis,
because
the
due
process
protections
accorded
absent
class
members
stems
from
the
due
process
clause,
not
from
article
3,
so
all
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
by
our
opponents
about
the
greater
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
v.
that
of
individual
states
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
that
is
being
asserted,
which
stems
from
the
due
process
clause,
the
same
clause
that
appears
both
in
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
in
fact,
this
court,
when
dealing
with
foreign
nationals,
has
treated
their
right
to
protection
from
jurisdiction
of
any
united
states
court
as
stemming
also
from
the
due
process
clause,
not
from
article
3,
so
arguments
about
greater
sovereignty
of
a
federal
court
potentially,
had
congress
granted
that,
versus
a
state
court,
really
can't
be
what
shutts
is
about.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
well,
it
could,
but
it
doesn't
seem
that
it
is,
because
the
pattern
of
thinking
and
the
pattern
of
argument
reflected
in
shutts
is
the
same
as
is
reflected
in
hansberry
v.
lee
and
mullane.
in
each
case,
this
court
addressed
first
the
territorial
jurisdictional
issue
and
concluded
that
state
courts
did
have
territorial
jurisdiction
to
entertain
class
actions
in
which
some
of
the
class
members
were
nonresident.
having
disposed
of
that
issue,
as
this
court
did
in
shutts
by
concluding
that
there
was
no
requirement
for
minimum
contacts
by
absent
class
members,
the
court
then
went
on
and
described
what
was
required
as
a
matter
of
minimal
due
process,
and
it
does
so
in
terms
of
a
host
of
protections
that
are
traditionally
thought
of
in
terms
of
procedural
due
process
equally
owed
by
a
federal
court.
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion,
other
than
in
responding
to
the
personal
jurisdiction
arguments
that
had
been
raised
below,
that
suggests
that
the
decision
should
not
apply
to
a
federal
court.
if
shutts
has
not
resolved
this
issue,
however,
and
if
a
mathews
analysis
is
appropriate
for
the
first
time
in
this
case,
then
we
submit
that
the
absent
class
members
win
hands
down,
and
they
do
because
there
is
no...
no
competing
governmental
interest
to
weigh
in
the
balance.
the
argument
that
has
been
asserted
here
is
that
if
we
allow
opt-outs
we
will
have
multiple
suits.
well,
(b)(3)
actions
avoid
multiple
suits
just
as
readily
as
(b)(2)
actions,
with
the
exception--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--well,
we
concede
that
the
rules
so
provide,
and
that
this
court
has
allowed
such
actions
in
the
past,
yes.
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
but
typically
in
those
cases
the
individual
interest
and
the
value
of
having
an
opt-out
rate
is
much
less
than
in
cases
that
would
otherwise
properly
be
brought
under
the
(b)(3)
label.
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)
phases,
properly
so
categorized,
the
interests
of
the
class
are
common.
the
case
will
be
decided
by
a
judge,
and
the
relief
to
be
accorded
will
be
common
to
all,
whether
they
opt
out
or
not.
if
the
named
plaintiff
proceeds,
even
without
a
class
being
certified,
and
succeeds
in
obtaining
injunctive
relief,
all
of
the
class
members
who
might
have
opted
out
will
benefit
from
that
relief.
the
damage
case
presents
some
peculiar
problems
because
of
the
likelihood
that
individuals
within
the
class
will
have
differing
damage
claims
or
be
subject
in
some
cases
to
defenses
that
other
members
of
the
class
are
not
subject
to.
that
is
why
(b)(3)
has
typically
been
thought
of
as
a
joinder
device,
not
a
true
class
action.
that
is
why
there
is
a
greater
need
for
opt-out.
also,
it
is
more
effective.
there
is
actually,
and
the
history
of
the
litigation
shows
that
allowing
an
opt-out
right
is
efficacious
in
cases
involving
monetary
damages.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
well,
the
constitutional
issues,
if
there
are
any,
in
a
(b)(1)(b)
class
action
have
perhaps
more
to
do
with
article
3
and
the
interrelationship
of
sitting
federal
judges
and
bankruptcy
judges
than
any
of
the
issues
that
have
been
presented
in
this
case.
since
those
issues
really
haven't
been
joined
in
this
case,
we
would
have
to
concede
that
in
that
situation
a
mandatory
class
is
appropriate.
the
governmental
interest
in
avoiding
multiple
suits,
we
contend,
is
equally
protected
in
(b)(3)
actions
with
one
exception,
and
the
one
exception
is
where,
in
the
case
of
a
settlement
class,
the
settlement
is
not
fair
to
all
of
the
claimants,
and
where
the
settlement
is
not
fair,
the
governmental
interest
in
avoiding
multiple
cases
must
give
way
to
the
fairness
that
is
owed
to
the
adversely
affected
class
members.
few
people
opt
out
of
settlements
that
are
fair,
particularly
where
they
need
to
then
go
fund
the
litigation,
and
particularly
in
class
action
situations
where
the
amount
of
damages
typically
is
not
as
large
as
a
normal
private
suit
might
involve.
so
the
reason
for
attempting
to
avoid
opt-out
can't
be
because
there's
a
strong
governmental
interest
in
avoiding
multiple
suits.
the
principal
reason
is
because
defendants
seek
to
avoid
all
future
litigation
in
the
settlement,
seek
to
use
it
as
a
way
to
cut
off
any
future
claims.
well,
allowing
that
to
occur
certainly
does
foster
greater
efficiency
in
the
sense
that
it
ends
litigation,
but
it
doesn't
foster
greater
fairness.
if
opt-out
is
allowed,
those
who
opt
out
are
opting
out
because
they
believe
their
claims
will
be
adversely
affected
by
the
settlement
that
is
proposed,
or
in
the
more
typical
case,
which
is
not
this
case,
where
the
certification
occurs
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
not
when
the
case
is
being
settled
and
those
individual
class
members
are
able
to
exercise
their
full...
their
full
power
under
the
basic
principle
of
hansberry
v.
lee
to
decide
their
own
litigation
fate.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
two
reasons.
first,
i
believe
hansberry
v.
lee
and
its
progeny
established
that
collateral
attacks
of
the
kind
brought
here
are
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
testing
the
preclusive
effect
of
such
a
judgment,
but
more
importantly,
as
i
think
i
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago,
there
was
no
first
class
mail
notice
in
this
case,
so
that
most,
if
not
all
the
affected
class,
did
not
know
there
was
anything
to
object
to.
it
is
true
that
a
handful
of
states
attorneys
general
knew
about
the
case,
and
one
way
or
the
other,
a
handful
of
individuals
learned
about
the
case
through
notice
by
publication,
but
most
of
the
class,
most
of
the
people
whose
claims
were
foreclosed,
purportedly,
never
knew
that
that
was
happening.
they
didn't
know
there
was
a
case
in
the
first
place.
they
didn't
know
they
were
represented
by
an
attorney.
they
didn't
know
the
attorney
had
dropped
the
damage
claims.
they
didn't
know
that
new
claims
had
been
asserted
of
an
injunctive
nature,
and
they
didn't
know
that
the
damage
claims
were
being
traded
for
the
injunctive
relief.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
yes,
and
they--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--well,
the
attorney
general
of
arizona
sought
to
opt
out,
and
took
that
to
the
third
circuit,
which
affirmed
the
judgment
without
opinion,
and
in
a
subsequent
opinion
explained
that
decision
as
likely
reflecting
their
understanding
and
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
here
had
advanced
that
collateral
attack
was
the
appropriate
vehicle
to
test
the
right
to
opt
out.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
probably
not.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
well--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--if
the
attorney--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--well,
had
he
been
certified
as
a
representative,
had
the
attorney...
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
question.
had
the
attorney
general
of
arizona
been
certified
as
the
class
represent...
as
attorney
for
a
proper
class
representative
of
the
arizona
class,
well
then,
of
course
there
would
be...
the
issue
would
have
been
decided
on
direct
appeal,
and
there
would
be
nothing
left
to
decide,
because
the
absent
class
members
would
have
been
proper
parties
at
that
point.
here,
they
never
were
proper
parties.
they
weren't
named
parties.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
well,
we
would
have
that
right,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
had
we
been
in
the
case
as
proper
parties,
that
right
would
have
been
adjudicated
in
the
third
circuit
and
we
would
no
longer
be
able
to
challenge
it
again,
but
that
didn't
occur.
we
never
had
that
opportunity.
the
attorney
general
tried,
but
the
plaintiff
here
did
not.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
they
were,
the
school
boards
and
so
forth.
they
sought
also
to
appear
as
parens
patriae
but
were
not
so
accepted
by
the
district
court.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
yes.
they
were
as
equally
adversely
affected
as
the
other
absent
class
members,
but
for
the
fact
that
they
chose
to
participate,
because
they
learned
of
the
case
and
appeared
and
objected.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
well,
no,
i
don't
believe
i
said
that.
perhaps
i--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--oh...
no,
i
was
not
asserting
that.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
no,
i
think
what
i
asserted
was
that
had
the
attorney
general
of
arizona
been
appointed
as
class
counsel
for
a
class
representative
from
arizona,
yes,
there
would
still
have
been
an
argument
that
we
had
a
right
to
opt
out,
but
that
argument
would
have
been
adjudicated
in
the
third
circuit
where
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
arizona...
in
fact--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--none
of
them
were
from
arizona
or
wisconsin.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
yes,
they
were.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
not
everybody,
but
everybody
whose
address
can
be
found.
that
was
the
holding
in
mullane.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
correct.
in
other
words,
when
you
can
give
people
the
notice
that
is
due
them,
they
should
get
that
notice.
yes,
we
have
the
problem
where
there
are
trust
common
fund
situations
where
there
are
beneficiaries
who
cannot
be
found,
and
so
forth,
and
a
court
must
proceed.
mullane
recognizes
that
kind
of
an
exception,
but
here,
there
were
certainly
many
purchasers
of
title
insurance
in
the
states
of
arizona
and
wisconsin
who
could
have
received
first
class
mail
notice.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
well,
i
think
that
in
all
of
the
cases
that
have
come
after
mullane,
most
class
lawyers
have
thought
that
mullane
means
that
first
class
mail
notice
is
required
if
it
is
possible,
in
an
appropriate
case.
now,
there
are
provisions
in
the
rule,
in
rule
23,
for
avoiding
that,
but
the
issue
comes
up,
if
you
will,
only
in
terms
of
explaining
why
the
absent
class
members
did
not
have
an
obligation
to
come
appear
and
challenge
their
inability
to
opt
out
in
mdl
633,
and
my
answer
to
that
is,
in
many
cases
they
didn't
know
there
was
anything
to
challenge.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
i
can't
know
that,
but
it
must
be
the
case
that
if
the
notice
by
publication
which
the
petitioners
here
certified
they
did
at
the
time
was
done
and
was
done
properly,
someone
must
have
read
it
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
correct.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
yes.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
we
believe
that
it
was
inadequate
under
the
rules.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
it
depends
on
how
you
look
at
what
actually
transpired
in
mdl
633,
because
technically
the
complaints
never
were
amended
to
drop
the
damage
claims,
but
as
a
practical
matter
and
by
judicial
decision,
they
were.
the
class
lawyers
who
had
brought
these
treble
damage
claims,
clearly
(b)(3)
type
cases,
decided
they
would
not
pursue
those
claims
because
they
didn't
think
they'd
win,
so
they
brought,
in
effect,
another
case,
and
then
traded
the
claims
they
were
no
longer
going
to
pursue
for
the
claims
they
now
wished
to
pursue,
the
net
result
being
the
payment
of
substantial
attorneys
fees
and
no
recovery
for
the
class.
that's
what
we
object
to.
we
think
there's
two
ways
of
looking
at
that.
one
is
that
the
certification
itself
was
okay
under
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2),
but
what
was
improper
was
the
attempt
by
the
trial
court
in
633
to
foreclose
damage
claims
that
were
never
really
litigated.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
probably
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
justice
scalia.
probably
at
this
point
barred
by
the
statute.
i
might
add,
however,
just...
since
you've
raised
it,
because
the
case
has
settled,
this
case
will
proceed
on
its
track
in
a
sense
regardless
of
the
outcome
here,
and
so
i
don't
think
that
issue
will
ever
actually
arise.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
the
settlement
that's
actually
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
we...
it
was
our
side,
and
what
we
moved
for
was
a
deferral
of
the
briefing
and
the
argument
pending
final
approval
in
the
district
court.
the
status
is
that
since
the
court
denied
that
motion,
a
final
settlement
agreement
has
been
entered
into
between
the
parties,
a
motion
has
been
filed
in
the
ninth
circuit
seeking
a
limited
return
of
a
mandate
for
purposes
of
allowing
the
district
court
to
consider
the
settlement,
and
i
believe
we're
within
a
few
days
of
finalizing
a
proposed
order
to
submit
the
entire
matter
to
judge
mcnamee
in
arizona
for
preliminary
and
ultimately
final
approval.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
that
would
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
say.
i
believe
that
we
will
be
able
to
submit
it
to
judge
mcnamee
in
the
month
of
march,
possibly
early
in
the
month
of
march,
because
there
are
very
few
issues
between
us
on
the
proposed
order
at
this
point.
there
are
some
matters
that
he
will
want
to
consider
when
we
bring
it
to
his
attention,
and
i
don't
know
how
quickly
he'll
act.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
yes.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
yes.
there
will
be
a
month
or
two
period
for
notice,
and
opportunity
to
object
in
the
final
approval
hearing.
perhaps
this
is
a
6-month
matter,
but
that's
just
a
guess.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
i
don't
believe
it
would.
i
believe
that...
well,
except
in...
it's
difficult
to
predict
a
result
that
hasn't...
an
outcome
that
doesn't
exist
yet,
but
it's
my
belief
that
regardless
of
what
happens
in
this
court,
the
settlement
process
will
go
forward.
we
have
an
agreed-upon
settlement,
and
certainly
from
the
side
of
the
petitioners,
they've
bound
themselves
to
the
settlement
both
3
days
before
cert
was
granted
and
now
again,
since
cert
was
granted,
so
we
believe
that
the
settlement
would
certainly
be
binding
upon
the
petitioners,
regardless
of
the
outcome.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
i
think
that
entirely
depends
upon
the
speed
with
which
you--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--dispose
of
the
case.
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
i
can't
provide
that
to
you
standing
here,
justice
scalia.
i
will
point
out,
however--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--no,
i
cannot--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--give
that
to
you
here,
but
i
can
point
out
to
you
that
the
traditional,
the
old
and
original
equity
rule
under
which
the
permissive
joinder
cases
were
allowed
as
a
matter
of
the
rule
specified
that
there
would
be
no
binding
effect
as
a
result
of
any
judgment
entered
on
absent
class
members,
those
who
chose
not
to
interplead
under
the
procedures
of
the
day.
post--
mr.
gerald
d.
w.
north
--we're
not
questioning
that.
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
in
my
argument.
