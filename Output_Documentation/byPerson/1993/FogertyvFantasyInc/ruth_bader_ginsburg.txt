mr.
sidle,
will
you
remind
us
where
the
language
showed
up
first,
because
it
is
identical
language?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sidle,
in
addition
to
the
"may"
language,
it's
a
double...
it's
in
its
discretion.
if
you
just
had
"may",
then
your
argument
of
the
british
rule
might
be
stronger,
but
"the
court
in
its
discretion
may--
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
your
point
that
the
district
judge
did
not
exercise
discretion
because
the
district
judge
didn't
believe
that
he
had
discretion
with
respect
to
a
successful
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
but...
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
at
one
time
the
patent
fee-shifting
statute
had
identical
words,
and
then
congress
added
the
qualification,
"in
exceptional
cases"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
course,
the--
--in
any
event,
the
lanham
act
and
the
patent
act
are
the
same
except
for
the
addition
of
the
words,
"in
exceptional
cases".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
court
is
concerned
with
disparity
among
the
circuits,
and
it
has
the
civil
rights
legislation,
and
it
has
the
lanham
act
and
the
patent
act,
and
if
the
question
is,
as
the
one
on
which
the
court
granted
cert,
which
of
these
models
is
the
appropriate
one
for
the
copyright
act...
now,
we
have
statutes
using
similar
language.
why
should
this
case...
why
should
the
copyright
act
be
bracketed
with
the
civil
rights
legislation
rather
than
with
the
trademark
and
patent
legislation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
that,
it
was
identical
to
the
copyright--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
was
it
interpreted,
when
it
was
identical
to
the
copyright
language,
with
a
tilt
toward
prevailing
plaintiffs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
did
congress
add,
in
exceptional
cases,
just
to
conform
the
law
to
what
the
courts
were
doing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
year
was
that
changed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then,
when
congress
redid
the
copyright
act
and
left
it
without
the
qualification,
wouldn't
the
implication
be,
it
wanted
to
have
a
standard
that
would
be
equal
on
both
sides,
but
not
limited
to
exceptional
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
i
take
it
if
you
were
prevailing
plaintiff
and
the
same
standard
applied,
you
would
not
get
fees--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
this
very
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
same
assessment
made
by
professor
brown
in
his
1960
study,
when
he
said,
or
if
the
losing
defendant
raised
real
issues
of
fact
or
law--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
losing
defendant
raises
real
issues
of
fact
or
law,
then
he
doesn't
pay
the
plaintiff's
counsel
fees.
that's
quite
a
different
standard
from
the
one
in
christiansburg.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robbins,
that
would
be
a
far
more
impressive
argument
if
that
were
the
rule
with
respect
to
patents
and
trademark,
but
you
concede
it
isn't,
and
what
i
find
so
difficult
to
understand
is
why
the
regimes
for
patent
and
trademark
are
not
the
ones
that
we
should
look
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
let's
go
to
the
patent
law,
where
you
told
me
that
before
the
change
for
exceptional
cases
it
was
identical
and
it
was
interpreted
the
same
way
for
prevailing
plaintiffs
and
prevailing
defendants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
isn't
that
the
closest
model
for
us?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry,
i
have
difficulty
following
that.
it
seems
in
this
very
case
we're
talking
about
the
same
composer,
and
a
question
of
whether
there
was
an
infringement
of
something
that
he
himself
created.
that
would
be...
i
can't
imagine
anything
that's
more
difficult
than
that,
to
determine
whether
you've
been
careful
enough
not
to
copy
yourself
too
much.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
there
anything
to
support
your
notion
that
as
a
general
matter
it's
easier
to
infringe
a
patent
than
a
copyright?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
really
is
hemming
in
the
discretion.
if
you
just
looked
at
the
statute
that
says
may
in
its
discretion,
what
you've
just
said,
there
really
isn't
any
discretion.
it
has
to
be
an
extreme
case,
even
though...
and
this
statute
doesn't
use
the
word,
in
exceptional
cases,
as
the
patent
act
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
might
be
more
of
a
question
about
whether
the
item
was
copyrightable
in
the
first
place,
because
isn't
there
a
rather
more
stringent
test
that
a
patent
has
to
pass
than
a
copyright
has
to
pass?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
one
thing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about
the
purpose
of
the
copyright
act
of
not
allowing
the
copyright
holder
to
extend
that
exclusivity
too
far?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some
of
them
written
right
into
the
statute,
like
the
fair
use
defense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
that
be
vindicating
a
public
policy?
the
defendant
who
was
saying,
this
is
fair
use
and
this
is
what
congress
says
is
good
for
the
public?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
true
of
defendants
generally,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robbins,
do
you
attribute
any
significance
to...
the
image
of
the
civil
rights
plaintiff
is
the
individual
alone
against
the
government,
against
the
corporation,
but
that
doesn't
translate
in
the
copyright
and
patent
area,
where,
as
in
this
very
case,
the
plaintiff
is
a
corporation,
and
the
defendant
is
an
individual,
so
the
two
don't
fit
together
very
neatly,
do
they?
