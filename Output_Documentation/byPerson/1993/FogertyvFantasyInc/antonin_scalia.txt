--well,
maybe
you
have
a
strong
argument
that
whatever
rule
they
adopted
ought
to
be...
it
ought
to
be
even-handed,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
have
an
argument
that
it
ought
to
be
the
british
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
suppose
i
agree
with
you
that
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander,
but
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
the
british
rule
was
necessarily
adopted,
i
just
think
that
congress
meant
to
leave
it
to
the
trial
judge,
and
the
trial
judge
had
a
lot
of
discretion,
but
he
shouldn't
load
it
for
one
side
rather
than
the
other?
how
do
i
dispose
of
this
case
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
assume...
assume
that
the
only
thing
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
wrong
is
to
apply
a
different
standard
to
defendants
than
it
applies
to
plaintiffs.
how
do
i
decide
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
they...
i
don't
know
which
standard...
they
should
apply
to
both.
i
just...
why
don't
i
just
affirm
and
say
but,
you
know,
but
in
the
future
be
sure
that
you
treat
plaintiffs
and
defendants
alike?
i'm
not
sure
they've
treated
you
wrong.
the
only
thing
i'm
sure
about
is
that
they
shouldn't
treat
you
differently
from
plaintiffs.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
how
the
statute
reads...
in
its
discretion.
i
think
the
statute
meant
to
leave
it
to
the
judge
to
decide.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't
know,
we
spoke
in
zipes
and
we
spoke
in
a
number
of
civil
rights
cases
of
private
attorneys
general.
i
don't
think
anybody
had
that
notion
in
1909
and
frankly
i
don't
consider
the
suing
copyright
holder
as
being
in
any
sense
a
private
attorney
general
vindicating
the
public,
not
the
way
we
regard
civil
rights
plaintiffs.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
do
it
anyway.
