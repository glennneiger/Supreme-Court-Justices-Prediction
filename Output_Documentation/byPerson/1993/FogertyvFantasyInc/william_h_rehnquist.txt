we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
92-1750,
john
c.
fogerty
v.
fantasy,
inc.--
mr.
sidle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
civil
rights
context.
what
does
that
mean?
does
that
mean
that
civil
rights
statutes
are
considered
something
special?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
from
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sidle.
mr.
robbins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
question
we
granted
certiorari
on,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
gives
one
the
impression
that
they
thought
that's
what
they
were
doing...
"with
regard
to
fogerty's
argument
that
the
existing
ninth
circuit
standard
should
be
abandoned
in
favor
of
the
approach
of
the
third
and
eleventh
circuits,
this
panel
is
bound
by
the
existing
circuit
rule.
"
--and
then
the
preceding
paragraph,
they
say
there
was
no
bad
faith,
therefore
no
attorney's
fees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
question
we
granted
certiorari
on,
that
we
took
the
case
to
decide.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
robbins,
in
the
sentence
before,
you
suggest
that
the
register
is
talking
only
about
the
awarding
of
fees
to
the
defense,
but
in
the
preceding
sentence,
she
says
the
discretionary
power
of
the
courts
to
require
the
losing
party
to
pay
a
reasonable...
is
intended
to
discourage
unfounded
suits
and
frivolous
defenses.
it
sounds
like
she's
talking
about
both
plaintiffs
and
defendants.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
really
can't
have
been
ratifying.
i
mean,
her
view
was...
if
her
view
is
accepted,
congress
certainly
did
not
ratify
the
view
that
you
say
obtained
before
1976,
that
only
plaintiffs
got
their
law...
got
their
attorney's
fees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
shouldn't
have
quoted
so
much
of
her
report,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sidle,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sidle.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
fogerty
versus
fantasy,
inc.
this
case
involves
a
dispute
over
the
proper
standards
for
awarding
attorney's
fees
to
successful
litigants
in
copyright
actions.
the
petitioner,
fogerty
a
musician,
successfully
defended
a
copyright
infringement
action
brought
against
him
by
the
respondent
here
and
he
then
filed
a
motion
for
attorney's
fees
under
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
copyright
act
which
provides
that
the
court
may
award
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
to
the
prevailing
party
as
part
of
the
cost.
the
district
court
in
los
angeles
denied
the
motion
for
fees
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
that
ruling
because
under
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
known
as
the
dual
standard,
prevailing
copyright
defendants
such
as
fogerty
must
show
that
the
original
infringement
suit
was
frivolous
or
brought
in
bad
faith
in
order
to
receive
fees.
but
prevailing
plaintiffs
are
generally
awarded
such
fees
as
a
matter
of
course.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
prevailing
plaintiffs
and
prevailing
defendants
must
be
treated
alike
under
section
505.
the
language
of
the
section
gives
no
hint
of
any
basis
of
a
distinction
and
the
other
arguments
in
favor
of
the
dual
standard,
we
disapprove.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is,
therefore,
reversed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
