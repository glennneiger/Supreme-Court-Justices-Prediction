mr.
sidle,
of
course,
this
court
has
to
face
up
the
christiansburg
case,
where
virtually
identical
language
on
attorney's
fees
was
interpreted
to
suggest
that
we
don't
grant
attorney's
fees
under
it
as
respondents--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
i
think
really
we
need
to
face
up
to
what
differences
there
are
that
would
compel
a
different
result
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
christiansburg
was
correctly
decided?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.--
--if
they...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sidle,
now,
the
british
rule
generally
awards
attorney's
fees
as
costs
just
as
a
matter
of
course
to
the
prevailing
party.
now,
i
think
we
have
some
other
circuits,
do
we
not,
that
would
say
there
is
no
presumption
of
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
a
prevailing
party?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
third,
maybe,
and
the
fourth
circuit,
they
consider
a
variety
of
factors.
what
is
it,
do
you
think--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--congress
adopted
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
excuse
me,
what
i'm
trying
to
pursue
is
whether
you
take
the
position
that
we
should
have
just
as
a
matter
of
course
a
policy
that
the
prevailing
party
gets
the
fees--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
do
you
approach
it
without
any
such
presumption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
robbins,
maybe
that's
so,
but
as
others
have
suggested
here,
we
are
concerned
with
the
rule,
and
there
are
at
least
some
members
of
this
court
that
think
the
text
of
the
statute
is
where
you
start
and
where
you
look,
and
it's
a
little
hard
to
read
a
dual
standard
into
that
text--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
maybe
it's
time
we
reiterated
that
to
a
congress--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
is
concerned
with
writing
these
things,
and
if
a
dual
standard
isn't
set
forth,
why
should
we
strain
to
find
one--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--particularly
in
a
context
like
this
statute,
where
there
can
be
policies
on
either
side
that
as
a
public
matter
need
supporting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
was
it
interpreted
before
that
language
was
adopted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
