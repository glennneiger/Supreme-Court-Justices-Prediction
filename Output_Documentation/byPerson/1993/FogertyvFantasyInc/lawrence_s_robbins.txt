mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
asks
the
wrong
question
in
this
case
and
provides
two
competing
but
i
think
equally
mistaken
solutions.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
standard
for
prevailing
defendants
and
prevailing
plaintiffs
ought
to
be
the
same,
even-handed,
or
different...
dual.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
way
the
question
was
formulated
was,
should
there
be
a
dual
standard
and
should
the
defendant
receive
its
fees
pursuant
to
a
standard
that
says,
do
you
get
fees
only
when
they're
objectively
unreasonable?
it
is
the
last
prong
of
that
question,
however
it
may
have
been
formulated,
that
was
in
fact
what
the
lower
court
decided.
the
lower
court
did
not
decide
this
case
by
virtue
of
a
rule
that
says,
the
standards
have
to
be
different,
because
there
isn't
a
prevailing
plaintiff
in
this
case.
the
ques--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
latter
half
of
what
your
honor
just
quoted
from
the
opinion
is
in
fact
the
theory,
the
argument,
the
rationale
of
the
lower
court
opinion.
that
is
to
say,
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
case
against
petitioner
because
it
found,
i
think
correctly,
that
plaintiff,
although
unsuccessful
at
trial,
brought
neither
an
objectively
unreasonable
lawsuit
nor
litigated
in
bad
faith.
that's
why
we
won
the
fee-shifting
issue.
whether...
whether
we
would
have
won
fees
if
we
had
been
the
prevailing
party
under
the
ninth
circuit's
standard
for
prevailing
plaintiffs
is,
i
think,
a
question
not
presented.
now,
it's
true,
your
honor--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
your
honor,
i'm
prepared
and
happy
to
address
the
question
of
what
standard
should
apply
to
prevailing
plaintiffs.
all
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
the
piece
of
the
question
presented,
that
in
fact
constitutes
the
rationale
for
the
decision
below,
is
in
my
judgment
the
only
question
that
is
really
before
the
court.
in
other
words,
your
honor
can...
this
court
can
affirm--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
actually
think
you
have
to
make...
bracket
it
with
one
or
the
other.
it
seems
to
me
that...
first
of
all
the
lanham
act...
and
let
me
go
back
to
a
question
you
asked
my
adversary.
in
fact,
it
is
the
case
that
the
patent
act
was
amended
to
incorporate
the
language,
"exceptional
circumstances".
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
was
indeed.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
was
interpreted
with,
i
think,
no
tilt
at
all,
but
interpreted
with
respect
to
prevailing
defendants
the
same
way...
the
same
way
that
the
ninth
circuit
interpreted
this
statute
and
so
that,
had
this
been
a
patent
act
case
adjudicated
under
the
prior
version
of
the
patent
law,
this
case
with
respect
to
the
prevailing
defendant
would
have
come
out
in
exactly
the
same
way.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
exactly,
and
they
said
so
in
exactly
those
words,
justice
ginsburg.
they
said,
we
want
you
to
know
that
the
courts
have
been
getting
it
right.
we
want
you
to
know
that
the
courts
have
correctly
construed
the
statute,
and
that
even
though
the
words,
"exceptional
circumstances",
have
not
previously
appeared
in
the
statutes,
the
courts
have
been
getting
it
right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
believe
it
was
the
amendment
of
either
'46
or
'52.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
in
fact
the
presumption
is
exactly
the
opposite,
and
let
me
turn
to
that
argument
in
particular.
the
present
version
of
section
505
is
essentially
unchanged
from
the
version
that
appeared
in
the
1909
act
with
respect
to
the
attorney's
fees.
the
language
has
been...
they
changed
some
dependant...
the
order
of
some
dependant
clauses,
but
basically
the
text
is
identical,
unchanged,
and
prior
to
1976,
that
language
with
respect
to
prevailing
defendants,
which
is
what
mr.
fogerty
is
this
morning,
that
language
was
construed
in
dozens
of
cases.
case
after
case,
circuit
after
circuit,
the
courts
grappled
with
what
that
language
meant,
and
in
every
single
case
of
a
prevailing
defendant,
without
exception,
a
prevailing
defendant
got
his
attorney's
fees
if,
but
only
if,
the
plaintiff's
case
was
objectively
unreasonable,
and
that
is
the
standard
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
to
petitioner,
and
that's
why
petitioner
is
here
today
asking
for
his
attorney's
fees.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
and
were
even
before
that.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
i
think
actually
it
isn't,
justice
stevens.
attorney's
fees
were
always
discretionary,
even
when
costs
were
mandatory,
so
the
earlier
version,
the
precursor
to
which
your
honor
adverts,
the
1909
section
40
and
later
section
116
of
the
1909
act,
said
that
you
get
your
fees...
you
get
your
costs
automatically
if
you
prevail,
and
you
may
get
your
attorney's
fees
as
part
of
costs...
you
may.
the
costs--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--all
of
it
is
discretionary,
but
what
i
think
that
tells
you
is
that
the
doctrine,
the
presumption
of
ratification...
this
goes
back,
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
question.
the
presumption
of
ratification
is
as
compelling
as
you
can
imagine,
because
in
contrast
to
many
of
the
court's
other
ratification
cases...
and
they're
as
recent
as
last
year's
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
keene
case,
where
the
presumption
that
congress
knows
of
and
ratifies
a
prevailing
construction
of
identical
language
when
it
reenacts
that
language,
that
presumption
has
special
force,
i
suggest,
in
this
case,
because
here,
the
1976
act
was
a
dramatic
overhaul
of
the
copyright
act,
top
to
bottom.
in
fact,
they
even
amended,
justice
stevens,
the
piece
of
the
cost
and
fee
provisions
that
dealt
with
costs,
but
what
they
left
alone
was
the
one
and
only
part
of
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court
this
morning,
and
they
left
it
alone
in
the
face
of--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
unless
i'm
misunderstanding
your
question,
justice
stevens,
no
court
to
my
knowledge
ever
said,
under
the
fee
provision
of
the
1909
act,
the
attorney's
fee
provision,
no
court
had
ever
said
plaintiffs...
prevailing
plaintiffs
and
prevailing
defendants
get
them
on
the
same
terms.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
if
you're
adverting.
justice
stevens,
to
the
six--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
it
does,
but
again,
i
don't
want
to
beg
the
question
that
has
been
formulated
by
petitioner--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--but
what...
but--
[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
understand.
i
understand,
and
i'd
like
to
make
a
defense
for...
and
i
propose
to
make
a
defense
for
prevailing
plaintiffs
this
morning
as
well,
which
we've
been
a
prevailing
plaintiff.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
if--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--if
the
standard
for
prevailing
plaintiffs,
justice
ginsburg,
were
that
prevailing
plaintiffs,
like
prevailing
defendants,
get
their
fees
only
when
the
opposing
side's
arguments
were
merit...
were
objectively
unreasonable,
i
suspect
we
would
have
had
a
hard
time
getting
our
attorney's
fees.
let
me
also
say
that
that
is
in
fact
not
the
standard
for
prevailing
plaintiffs
even
in
the
most
generous
pro-plaintiff
circuits,
so
that
the
premise
of
the
british
rule
that
petitioner
asked
for
this
morning
in
fact
rests
on
a
false
premise
even
about
what's
true
for
prevailing
plaintiffs.
but
justice
stevens,
to
get
back
to
the
register's
report,
what
the
register
of
copyrights
said
in
'61
is
that
the
courts
have
generally
denied
award
of
attorney's
fees
where
the
losing
party
had
solid
grounds
for
litigating
his
claim
or
defense,
and
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law
as
to
prevailing
defendants,
and
my
submission
on
ratification
is
simply
this,
that
that
was
the
state
of
the
law
not
just
in
most
cases,
but
i
defy...
i
defy
my
colleague
to
find
a
single
exception
to
that
doctrine.
it
sure
isn't
lewys
v.
o'neill.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
that's
quite
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
she
is,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
in
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
actually
not
my
position
on
plaintiffs
at
all.
i
mean,
defendants
got
attorney's
fees
before
'76,
and
plaintiffs
did.
they
tended
to
get
them
under
different
circumstances,
and
i
think
my
reliance
on
what
the
register
said
goes
only
to
the
question
whether
the
ninth
circuit
standard
that
was
applied
in
this
case
for
prevailing
defendants
is
correct.
now,
it's
true
that
the
register
also
made
a
statement
summarizing
what
she
took
to
be
the
law
for
prevailing
plaintiffs
as
well.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
her
assessment
of
the
state
of
the
law
as
to
prevailing
plaintiffs
was
not
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--again,
that
statement
is
in
the
brown
report,
and
it
may
well
be
that
there
were
cases
with
respect
to
prevailing
plaintiffs
that
had
a
somewhat
less
generous
standard
than
any
sort
of
presumptive
award
for
prevailing
plaintiffs,
and
i
don't
want
to
overly
resist
the
question
that
i
know
the
court
is
interested
in,
but
i
suggest
that
whatever
the
rule
for
prevailing
plaintiffs
may
ultimately
be,
the
same
as
defendants
or
different
from
defendants,
or
marginally
different
from
defendants,
this
defendant,
the
petitioner,
is
still
going
to
lose,
because--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--let
me--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
let
me
address
that
directly,
justice
o'connor.
it
seems
to
me,
first
of
all,
that
whatever...
even
if
it's
an
even-handed
standard,
and
i
dislike
the
metaphor,
because
it
suggests
that
the
other
view
is
a
somehow
underhanded...
underhanded
standard,
and
one
certainly
doesn't
want
to
be
called
not
even-handed...
i
actually
believe...
and
this
harkens
back,
justice
souter,
to
a
point
that
you
made
earlier.
i
actually
believe
that
what
is
called
a
dual
standard,
or
what
i
would
prefer
to
call
a
standard
that
says,
in
essence,
that
the
plaintiff
will
generally
receive
its
fees
unless
certain
factors
are
met,
whereas
a
prevailing
defendant
gets
its
fees
only
when
the
plaintiff's
lawsuit
is
objectively
unreasonable
or
litigated
in
bad
faith,
is
in
fact
even-handed
in
the
sense
that
matters,
and
let
me
turn
to
what
i
take
to
be,
i
submit
this
morning,
the
controlling
decision
of
this
court
after
which
one
needs,
i
think,
to
look
no
further,
and
that
is
this
court's
decision
in
zipes.
zipes
is
a
case
in
which
you
have
a
prevailing
civil
rights
plaintiff,
a
plaintiff
that
by
petitioner's
view
this
morning
is
advancing
a
public
policy
of
surpassing,
almost
unequalled
importance.
nevertheless,
that
prevailing
plaintiff
did
not
get
its
attorney's
fees.
it
didn't
get
it's
attorney's
fees
because
the
losing
intervenor
in
that
case
was
held
not
to
have
commit...
be
a
wrongdoer
within
the
required
sense
of
fee-shifting
provisions.
what
the
court
said
in
zipes
is
that
the
rule
for
a
fee-shifting
should
respect...
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
court's
language...
"the
crucial
connection
between
liability
for
violation
of
federal
law
and
liability
for
attorney's
fees
under
federal
fee-shifting
statutes.
"
i
think
that
is
a
rule
that
decides
this
case.
when
a
defendant
loses
a
copyright
infringement
case,
that
constitutes
a
finding
that
the
defendant
violated
statutory
law,
not
that
he's
a
bad
person,
and
that
gets...
deals
with
the
quibble
in
the
reply
brief
that
unconscious
copying
doesn't
make
you
a
bad...
a
wrongdoer.
i
don't
mean
that,
you
know,
literally
someone,
you
know,
who's...
this
is
not
sort
of
a
moral...
a
sense
of
blameworthiness
in
that
sense.
it
is
someone
who
has
violated
the
law,
someone
who
ought
to
be
assessed
attorney's
fees.
conversely,
when
a
plaintiff
acts
unreasonably,
or
litigates
in
bad
faith,
or
brings
a
frivolous
lawsuit,
he,
too,
is
abusing
the
machinery
of
the
copyright
system.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
with
respect
to
trademark,
i'd
like
to
suggest,
justice
ginsburg,
that
this
court's
discussion
in
footnote
19
of
the
sony
case
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
trademark
law
lacks
the
necessary
kinship
with
the
copyright
law
to
be
a
workable
analogue--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
with
respect
to
the
patent
law,
it
may
not...
i
guess
i
can
define
some
policies
in
the
patent
area,
for
example,
the
greater
ease
with
which
you
might
innocently
infringe
on
a
patent,
and
so
there's
a
fear
that,
you
know,
fee-shifting
too
readily
would
sweep
up
innocent--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--defendants.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
this
wasn't...
you
know,
a
case
without
its
difficulties.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
mean,
i
don't...
i'm
not
insisting
on
those
differences.
i
mean,
obviously
in
the
copyright
area
there
is
the
notion
of
copying,
which
obviously
has
a
notion
of
deliberateness
to
it,
and
i
think...
i
suspect
that
there
is
less
reason
to
believe,
in
the
copyright
area...
though
this
may
not
ultimately
be
true
if
you
looked
at
every
individual
litigation,
i
suspect
there
may
be
a
sense
in
which,
in
the
copyright
area,
you
are
less
likely
to
sweep
within
your
net
defendants
who
have
acted
completely
by
happenstance
and
just
happened
upon
the
exact
same
text,
or
the
exact
same
song.
but
i
think,
justice
ginsburg...
and
i
really
do
need
to
recur
to
this
basic
point.
in
the
patent
area
as
well,
the
standard
for
prevailing
defendants
is
the
same
as
the
standard
that
was
applied
to
mr.
fogerty.
it's
the
same.
patent
defendants
do
not
get
their
fees
unless
the
patent
claimed
by
the
plaintiff
was
objectively
unreasonable
or
frivolous,
or
litigated
in
bad
faith,
and
that's
the
standard
on
which
this
case
was
decided,
and
that's
the
standard
on
which
we
win,
and
if
anything,
the
patent
law,
i
think,
is
good
for
the
piece
of
the
case
that
i
believe
is
truly
before
the
court.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
may
be
that
the
analogue
to
the
patent
cases
suggests
a
closer
harmony
between
plaintiffs
and
defendants.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
but
truly
that
was
equally
the
case
in
the
zipes...
in
zipes
as
well,
where
the
fee-shifting
provision
of
title
vii
was...
on
its
face
conferred
significant
discretion
and
in
fact
this
court...
the
opinion--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
i
mean,
i
think...
i
mean,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
ultimately
the
circuits
that
have
distinguished
between
plaintiffs
and
defendants
have
focused
on
the
need
to
create
the
requisite--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
believe
that
to
be
the
case,
but
i
don't
want
to
overstate
my--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--knowledge
of
patent
law.
i
think
the
point,
justice
stevens,
that
you
get
to,
is
that
the
greater
readiness
of
some
circuits
to
shift
fees
towards
prevailing
plaintiffs
reflects
a
view
that
is
sort
of
a
matter
of
economic
reality.
that
incentive
is
needed
to
provide...
to
encourage
the
plaintiff
to
bring
the
lawsuit
to
litigate
his
claim
and
to
enforce
and
therefore
effectuate
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
copyright
act
as
a
whole,
so
let
me
turn--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think...
i
don't
dispute
that
there
is
some
public
purpose
served--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
that's
right,
and
if
a
defendant
has
a
fair
use
defense,
the
fair
use
text
will
make--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
that's
right.
i
think
when
a
defendant
vindicates
a
fair
use
he
is
serving
a
purpose
that
is
plainly
written
into
section
107
of
the
act.
but
i
also
think,
justice
ginsburg...
i
also
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
standard
allows
sufficient
adversarial
play
in
the
system
for
just
exactly
the
reasons
that
this
court
in
christiansburg
garment
thought
the
fee-shifting
provision
of
title
vii
gave
defendants
a
robust...
a
sufficient
incentive
to
litigate
their
legitimate
claims.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
a
defendant
in
a
copyright
infringement
action
within
the
ninth
circuit
standard
has
all
the
incentive
in
the
world
to
do
a
really
good
job,
and
this
lawsuit
is
ample
proof
of
that.
after
all--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
it
is
true
of
defendants
generally,
but
i
also
think
that
where
you
have
a
fee-shifting
provision
that
allows
the
defendant...
in
the
event
that
he
shows
the
plaintiff's
case
to
be
objectively
unreasonable,
that
gives
him
the
incentive
to
fight
that
much
harder
to
make
the
requisite
showing.
i
think
there's
very
little
evidence
that
any
defendants
in
copyright
infringement
cases
are
hiding
their
light
under
a
bushel
on
the
ground
that
they
may
not
have
exactly
the
same
fee-shifting
standard
that
prevailing
plaintiffs
do,
and
surely
that
is
not
true
of
this
petitioner.
the
fact
is
that
a
defendant
has
the
same
incentive
that
this
court
thought
in
christiansburg
garment
was
sufficient
to
warrant
the
construction
of
the
identical
language
in
section
706(k)
of
title
vii
that
this
court
in
christiansburg
garment
construed
to
have
the
same
standard
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
for
prevailing
defendants
under
section
505.
let
me
just
recur
again
to
this
court's
admonition
that
similarly
worded
fee-shifting
provisions
ought
to
be
similarly
construed,
and
the
most
similar
fee-shifting
provision
that
this
court
has
construed
is
the
fee-shifting
provision
in
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
on
the
other
hand,
at
the
time
that
the
copyright
act
was
enacted,
they
also
enacted
section
1988,
the
same
congress,
and
both
of
those...
and
1988
has
also
been
construed
by
this
court
to
have
the
same
standard
for
prevailing
defendants.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
also
think
that
the
policies
and
purposes
that
this
court
identified
in
christiansburg
garment,
and
that
explained
why
that
identical
language
was
given
exactly
the
construction
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
to
section
505
for
prevailing
defendants,
those
policies
are
ones
that
i
suggest
transcend
the
particular
statutory
provision
in
which
the
fee-shifting
statute
happens
to
be
embedded.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
i
don't
want
to
overstate
the
similarities,
but
i
also
don't
have
to,
because
christiansburg
garment
turns
not
simply
on
the
metaphor
of
private
attorneys
general,
although
to
be...
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
going
to
do
it
anyway.
[laughter]
i
think,
in
fact,
this
court's
copyright
jurisprudence
makes
the
central
point
that
copyright
plaintiffs
are
suing
not
only,
and
for
that
matter
not
even
merely
in
their
own
interests,
though
surely
that's
what
they
do,
but
also,
and
more
importantly,
to
advance
a
larger--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--in
fact,
justice
ginsburg,
respectfully,
i
do
not
attribute
much
significance
to
that
distinction,
and
let's
step
out
of
the
title
vii
context
and
turn
to
1988.
1988,
which
also
has
the
same
language,
and
also
gets
construed
exactly
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
construed
section
505
for
prevailing
defendants...
1988
is
the
attorney's
fee
provision
that
allows
1983
prevailing
plaintiffs
to
get
their
attorney's
fees,
and
as
your
honor
knows,
1983
has
been
the
engine
for
recovery
for
a
number
of
plaintiffs
who
don't
look
anything
like
the
typical
civil
rights
individual
struggling
against
the
wealthy
corporation.
golden
state,
you
know,
the
virginia
hospital
association,
these
are
wealthy
corporate
plaintiffs
who
had
the
wherewithal
to
bring
that
lawsuit.
they
won
it
under
1988...
1983,
and
in
some
cases
have
gotten
their
attorney's
fees,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
metaphor
translates
very
well,
nor
do
i
think
that
505
should
be
specially
carved
out
for
one
type
of
plaintiff,
another
type
of
defendant.
the
statute
i
think
deserves
the
kind
of
categorical
construction
that
the
analogies
in
similarly
worded
fee-shifting
provisions
warrant.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--thank
you.
