if
that
was
the
intention
of
congress
in
1909,
why
did
it
use
such
neutrally
permissive
language?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
the
british
rule
is
a
lot
stronger
than
"may
also
award".
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
less
slippery
than
leaving
it
in
an
entirely
permissive
posture.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
would
seem
to
me
to
counsel
somewhat
greater
precision,
if
that's
what
they
intended
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
the
argument
is
made
that
even
under
the
present
dispensation
in
the
ninth
circuit,
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander,
because
each
of
the
awards
rests
upon
a
fault
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that
unsound?
i
mean,
your
argu...
your
response
to
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
well,
there
may
indeed
be
a
fault
justifying
the
award
in
each
of
the
two
sets
of
circumstances,
but
that
rule
should
be
avoided
here
because
a
defendant
like
my
defendant
is
basically
conveying
a
benefit
upon
society,
but
i
take
it
you
don't
find
anything
analytically
wrong
with
the
theory
that
there
is
fault
justifying
both
the
plaintiff
rule
and
the
defendant
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
if
the
plaintiff
wins,
the
plaintiff
has
shown
that
there
is
a
violation
of
a
federal
statutory
policy.
that's
the
fault.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're
not
saying
that
you're...
you
know,
that
you're
morally
reprehensible,
or
that
you're
going
to
be
dammed
for
eternity.
they're
simply
saying
that
the...
that
the
defendant
who
loses
has
violated
a
statutory
policy,
and
that's
important.
it's
just
as
important
as
avoiding
frivolity
by
plaintiffs.
