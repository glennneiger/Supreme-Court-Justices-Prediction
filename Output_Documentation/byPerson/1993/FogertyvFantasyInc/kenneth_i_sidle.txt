mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
application
of
the
dual
standard
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
petitioner
fogerty
in
this
case
results
in
a
perversion
of
the
policies
of
the
copyright
act.
the
ninth
circuit
standard
is
based
upon
an
implicit
assumption
about
the
nature
of
the
parties
to
a
copyright
act,
to
wit,
that
the
plaintiff
is
a
copyright
author
who
is
seeking
to
sue
a
business
enterprise
that
has
copied
his
work,
but
in
this
case,
we
have
only
one
author.
that's
john
fogerty.
he
had
a
copyright,
a
work
that
he
said
was
an
original
creation,
that
was
not
copied.
he
has
vindicated
that
copyright
by
being
the
prevailing
party
in
a
copyright
case.
he
applied
for
his
attorney's
fees,
as
was
authorized
in
section
505,
and
the
court
denied
those
fees.
they
denied
the
fees
because
he
was
a
defendant.
there
is
no
policy
in
the
copyright
act
that
justifies
the
distinction
against
this
author
based
upon
his
status
as
a
defendant.
what
possible
policy
could
there
be
under
the
copyright
laws
that
the
plaintiff
in
the
case,
a
copyright
owner,
had
fantasy
won
the
case,
would
be
awarded
its
fees,
but
fogerty,
the
author
in
the
case,
would
not
be
awarded
his
fees
even
though
he
had
done
exactly
what
the
copyright
laws
asked
him
to
do,
which
is
create
a
new
original
work?
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
but
the
christiansburg--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well,
i
think
there's
dramatic
differences
between
civil
rights
cases
and
copyright
cases.
we
have
different
types
of
cases,
different
issues,
different
types
of
parties,
and
different
policies.
we
also
have
a
dramatically
different
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history
in
connection
with
the
civil
rights
statute
show
a
clear
recognition
on
the
part
of
congress
to
a
dual
standard.
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
is
virtually
silent
as
to
the
intention
of
congress--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--christiansburg
was
correctly
decided
in
the
civil
rights
context,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
can
carry
over
from
the
civil
rights
context
to
the
commercial
context
of
the
copyright
law
area.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
i
think
they
are
special.
i
think
they're--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--i
think
just
a
general
principle
that
congress--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well,
i
don't
know
that
i
can
say
there's
any
particular
authority
from
this
court
because
it
hasn't
faced
that
issue.
i
think
this
case
faces
that
issue.
what
this
court
has
in
the
copyright
area
has
a
clean
slate,
virtually.
it's
got
a
one-sentence
statement
in
the
1976
copyright
act
authorizing
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
it
then
has
a
whole
line
of
cases
in
the
civil
rights
area,
but
the
civil
rights
area
is
a
concept
of
a
private
attorney
general
bringing
an
action
for
remedying
social
problems
and
class-wide
problems.
the
copyright
area
is
typically
a
dispute
between
two
owners
of
property.
the
typical
copyright
case
is
two
copyright
proprietors,
one
trying
to
stop
the
other
from
marketing
their
product,
and
that
kind
of
property
dispute
should
not
use
the
analogy
from
a
civil
rights
case
where
you're
invoking
principles
of
class
discrimination
and
concepts
of
private
attorney
generals.
there's
no
concept
of
a
private
attorney
general.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
the
language
showed
up
first
in
the
copyright
act.
i
believe
the
first
civil
rights
act
was
a
'64
act,
and
then
this
court
had
its
alyeska
decision,
and
then
there
was
the
'76
civil
rights
attorney's
fee
act
that
congress
enacted
in
response
to
that.
it's
only
in
the
very
recent
past
that
there's
been
any
suggestion
from
even
the
courts
that
have
the
dual
standard,
and
i
think
they're
just
make-weight,
drawing
an
analogy
to
the
civil
rights
statute.
there's
no
indication
in
the
courts
that
they
were
viewing
the
plaintiffs
in
a
copyright
case
as
being
like
private
attorney
generals.
and
i
can
just
point
to
cases...
and
there's
also
a
happenstance
nature
to
this.
who
happens
to
be
the
plaintiff
in
a
copyright
case
can
be
any
one
of
a
number
of
parties.
this
court
has
had
cases
before
it...
for
example,
mills
music.
you
had...
a
party
who
received
music
copyright
royalties
interpleaded
the
funds.
the
contesting
parties
were
both
defendants
in
an
interpleader
action.
how
do
you
decide
who's
the
plaintiff
if
they
prevail
and
there's
a
dispute
there
over
whether
the
termination
of
a
copyright
under
the
'76
act
terminated
the
music
publishing
company's
right
to
royalties?
you
also
had
the
statute
case,
community
of
non-violence
v.
reid,
which
was
a
declaratory
relief
action.
it
was
a
question
of
who
owned
the
statue,
and
it
involved
the
question
of
a
work
for
hire.
either
of
those
parties
could
have
filed
that
action.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
yes.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
i
think
if
we're
looking
back
to
1909,
the
proper
thing...
the
proper
motive
to
project
on
congress
was
that
it
was
adopting
the
british
rule.
we
have
an
american
rule
that
parties
bear
their
own
fees,
and
every
first-year
lawyer
knows
that
the
alternative
to
that
is
the
british
rule.
at
that
time
it
was
somewhat
unusual
to
have
statutes
awarding
attorney's
fees.
congress
decided--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--when
you
say,
nobody's
ever
adopted
the
british
rule,
we
cite
the
lewys
case
in
our
brief
which
says
that
that's
what
congress
did,
and
that's
one
of
the
pre-1976
act
cases
that
fantasy
relies
upon
as
authority
that
there
was
a
dual
standard.
i
mean,
in
fact,
there
are
judges
who
interpreted
congress
as
doing
that.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
one
judge.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
what
the
ninth--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--i
think
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
do
with
respect
to
plaintiffs
is
what
congress
intended,
and
they
just
have
not
done
it
with
respect
to
defendants.
they've
adopted
a
different
standard
in
this
case
for
defendants.
we
have
in
the
lanham
act
and
the
patent
act
language
that
says...
and
those
are
the
closest
analogies
we
have
to
the
copyright
act.
we
have
congress
saying
in
exceptional
circumstances--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well,
when
you
say,
as
a
matter
of
course,
the
british
rule--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--i
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
general
course...
there
would
be
exceptions,
but
generally
the
prevailing
party
should
be
awarded
their
fees.
i
believe
that's
what
congress
intended.
i
believe
that's
consistent
with
the
policy
of
the
copyright
act.
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well,
i
think
that's--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well,
i
think
that
when
we
talk
about
generally
award,
or
usually
award,
it's
a
bit
slippery.
we're
not
talking
about
an
open--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well,
but
that's
also
in
the
context
of
granting
an
authority
where
there's
very
few
statutes
that
give
that
authority.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
well,
i
think
that
what
this...
this
court
is
writing
on
a
clean
slate
as
far
as
what
it
should
do
in
guiding
the
lower
district
courts,
and
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well
then,
what's
the
rationale
for
the
ninth
circuit
adopting
the
british
rule
with
respect
to
plaintiffs?
i
submit
to
you
that
congress,
in
looking
at
the
lanham
act
and
the
patent
act,
where
it
says,
"under
exceptional
circumstances
the
court
may
award
fees.
"
intended
that
to
be
the
standard
there.
what
has
happened
in
the
ninth
circuit
is,
it's
done
two
things.
with
respect
to
plaintiffs
they
have
adopted
the
british
rule,
and
with
respect
to
defendants
they've
adopted
the
lanham
act
and
the
patent
act
standard
for
defendants.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
i
think...
i
think
that
the
strongest
argument
for
that
comes
from
the
language
in
the
strauss
report
that
was
submitted
to
congress,
and
i
believe
it's
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
there
were
only
really
two
reports
given
to
congress,
the
brown
report
and
the
strauss
report,
and
what
they
say
about
attorney's
fees
is
very
limited,
but
if
the
court
reads
that
language
on
page
17,
i
think
you
come
away
with
basically
an
idea
that
at
least
what
was
presented
to
congress
was
to
award...
a
rule
that
was
an
economic
award
of
making
the
prevailing
party
whole.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
well,
i
think
that
you
should
maybe
do
a
bit
more
than
that
and
enlighten
the
district
court
judges
that
they
should
look
to
the
policies
of
the
copyright
act
in
determining
how
to
exercise
their
discretion.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
well,
you
reverse
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well,
i
think
that
then
the
court
will
have
cases
in
the
future
that...
they're
all
over
the
place,
and
i
think
that
you
would--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--yes,
in
the
context
of
a
copyright
act
that
has
policies
that
it's
trying
to
promote.
i
think
that
in
the
case
where
you
have
a
def--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--correct.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
that
i
don't
know.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
correct,
and
the
lanham
act
also
has
the
additional
gloss
that
they
put...
shift
the
burden...
normally
they
award
fees
to
defendants,
and
not
to
plaintiffs,
so
they
have
a
somewhat
dual
standard.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
that's--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--well,
the
existing
ninth
circuit
standard
has
a
different
standard
of
fault,
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
way.
if
you're
a
defendant,
the
fault
that
you've
got
to
show
is
either
frivolousness
or
bad
faith.
that's
a
very
heavy
standard.
plaintiff
essentially
just
has
to
win.
that's
all
the
fault
he
has
to
show.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
yes,
but
i
think
that
again
gets
off
into
the
concept
of
wrongdoing
in
a
business
statute.
the
statute...
in
the
copyright
area
you
have
defendants--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--okay,
i
accept
all
that,
but
then
that
finding
of
civil
liability
is
a
sufficient
finding
of
wrongdoing
to
award
fees
to
a
prevailing
plaintiff.
you
posited
some
degree
of
fault.
all
he
has
to
do
is
win,
whereas
the
defendant,
who
may
be
promoting
policies
that
this
court
has
recognized,
the
value
of
having
works
in
the
public
domain...
i
dare
say
that
over
the
last
20
years,
every
new
technology
case
that
has
come
before
this
court,
this
court
has
allowed
the
new
technology
to
go
forward
rather
than
finding
a
copyright
monopoly.
now,
are
all
of
those
defendants...
they've
done
a
public
benefit.
they're
creating
works,
they're
prevailing
parties,
they
should
be
entitled
to
their
fees
on
the
same
standards
as
the
plaintiffs,
not
based
on
a
disbalanced
fault
scale,
which
is
what
happens
right
now
in
the
ninth
circuit.
we
would
suggest
that
this
court
advise
the
district
courts
that
in
exercising
their
discretion
they
should
look
to
the
policies
of
the
copyright
act,
and
it's
not
a
question
of
wrongdoing.
this
is
not
a
question
of
finding
particular
fault,
but
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
party
involved
has
promoted
the
purposes
of
the
copyright
act,
and
a
defendant
author
has
promoted
the
purposes
of
the
copyright
act.
he's
created
an
original
work,
an
original
writing,
he's
increased
the
access
of
the
public
to
goods.
there
may
be
other
cases
where
other
factors
might
come
in
where
you
don't
have
a
defendant
author,
where
the
defendant
is
a
restaurant
owner
who's
broadcast
radio
signals,
or
something
like
that,
but
in
this
type
of
a
case
you
have
the
exact
kind
of
a
person
who
the
copyright
laws
have
tried
to
encourage
to
create
new
and
original
works,
and
he
has
done
exactly
that.
he
has
created
a
new
and
original
work,
and
he's
prevailed
in
a
trial
that
raised
that
very
issue.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
yes.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
well,
i
dare
say
in
every
case
there
are
motions
and
things...
people
don't
win
everything
in
a
lawsuit.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
well,
i
think
there
are
several
open
issues
on
how
the
judge
will
go
about
determining
the
amount
of
fees
in
this
case,
and
that
may
well
be
an
appropriate
thing
for
the
judge
to
determine
the
amount
of
fees,
what
time--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
we're
the
prevailing
party
in
this
case
entitled
to
our
fees,
and
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
some
motions
or
other
things
that
they
prevailed
on
along
the
way
does
not
turn
them
into
a
prevailing
party.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
well,
i
believe
that
an
even-handed
approach
will
have
a
dampening
effect
on
litigation.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
the
general
consensus
of
economists,
but
you
can
find
an
economist
who
can
create
a
model
for
almost
any
view
in
this
area,
as
you
read
those,
but
i
think
that's
kind
of
the
general
consensus.
i
think
the
argument
in
this
case
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
statute
results
in
encouraging
more
lawsuits
being
filed,
and
we're
saying
that's
not
really
a
proper
copyright
statute
policy,
to
foment
more
lawsuits.
a
proper
copyright
policy
is
to
have
serious
copyright
issues
litigated
and
determined,
and
that
is
best
done
with
an
even-handed
standard.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
points.
the
zipes
case
is
somewhat
difficult
to
conceptualize
as
a
copyright
case,
but
if
we
did,
i
think
it
would
be
fairly
easy
to
see
that
that's
a
good
case
that
illustrates
what
the
rule
should
be
in
copyright
cases
versus
what
the
rule
is
in
civil
rights
cases,
and
i
submit
that
because
there's
a
dual
standard
in
civil
rights
cases,
this
court
had
its
problems
in
zipes.
if
you
had
had
an
even-handed
standard,
it
wouldn't
have
been
that
difficult,
but
if
we
have
an
intervenor,
let's
say,
in
a
copyright
case
that
comes
in
and
says,
hey,
but
i
have
a
copyright,
and
that
keeps
the
plaintiff
from
bringing
this
case,
and
the
plaintiff
prevails
against
that,
on
an
even-handed
standard
he
would
get
his
fees.
the
problem
in
zipes
was,
you
in
effect
had
two
people
that
were
in
the
category
of
the
favored
plaintiff
in
a
civil
rights
case,
and
maybe
justice
blackmun's
dissent
was
correct
that
the
defendant
twa
should
have
won
the
costs.
that
at
least
would
have
been
consistent
with
the
policy.
but
i
think
that
the
zipes
case
is
a
strong
argument
for
why,
in
the
copyright
area,
where
you
just
have
businesses
fighting
over
control
of
literary
properties,
that
there
should
be
an
even-handed
standard.
now,
opposing
counsel
says
that
from
the
patent
area
we
have
the
law
applied
that
was
applied
to
the
defendant
in
this
case,
and
that's
correct.
the
only
difference
is
that
in
the
patent
law
it
expressly
says
that
it
will
only
be
under
exceptional
circumstances
that
fees
are
awarded,
whereas
in
the
copyright
law,
it
just
says
the
court
may,
without
any
requirement
of
exceptional
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
the
patent
cases?
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
it's
even-handed,
and
that's
what
we're
asking
for,
is
an
even-handed
standard,
and
i
think
justice
ginsburg's
point
is
well-taken,
that
congress
decided
to
change
the
patent
law
to
make
it
only
exceptional
circumstances.
it
did
not
make
that
decision
when
it
passed
the
1976
copyright
act.
it
did
not
put
exceptional
circumstances--
mr.
kenneth
i.
sidle
--but
that,
i
submit,
is...
and
i
also
submit,
despite
the
analogy
of
patent
law
being
closer
to
copyright
than
civil
rights
cases,
i
think
there
are
also
some
unique
considerations
in
copyright
cases.
the
simple
fact
is
that
prior
to
1976,
the
cases
were
all
over
the
board.
you
couldn't
say
that
there
was
certainly
any
dual
standard
that
was
clear.
i
would
point
out,
the
senate
report
on
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fee
award
act
in
1976,
which
we
cite
in
footnote
16
of
our
reply
brief,
the
senate
report
goes
on
and
recites
the
history
of
the
'64
civil
rights
act,
the
alyeska
case,
and
then
the
dual
standard,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
there
are
other
statutes
where
a
similar
dual
standard
has
been
interpreted
by
the
courts,
and
it
cites
the
water
pollution
control
act
and
the
marine
protection
act
as
other
places
where
there's
a
dual
standard.
it
doesn't
mention
the
copyright
act,
and
that
was
enacted
the
same
year
as
the
copyright
act,
so
i
don't
see
how
you
can
imply
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
there
was
a
dual
standard
that
they
were
ratifying
by
enacting
the
1976
copyright
act.
there
is
an
argument
that
defendants
have
sufficient
incentives
to
litigate
cases,
and
an
example
is
given
that
fogerty
defended
this
case.
well,
i
dare
say
that
plaintiffs
have
a
sufficient
interest
to
litigate
cases
whether
they
get
preferential
treatment
in
attorney's
fees
or
not.
typically,
plaintiffs
in
copyright
cases
are
trying
to
reap
a
substantial
reward
that
the
defendant
is
reaping.
if
there's
any
common
denominator
in
copyright
cases,
it
is
that
the
defendant
has
been
successful.
plaintiffs
don't
bother
suing
an
unsuccessful
writer,
or
author,
or
songwriter,
and
they
are
looking
at
their
pot
of
gold,
and
you
can
make
the
same...
just
turn
the
mirror
around
and
say
the
same
things
to
plaintiffs.
congress
has
seen
fit
in
certain
circumstances
to
put
its
thumb
on
the
scales.
in
the
copyright
laws
we
have
statutory
damage
provisions,
which
they
say
to
plaintiffs,
well,
maybe
there's
not
enough
money
here
to
bring
a
suit,
so
we'll
specifically
enact
statutory
damages
that
you
can
enact,
and
that
gives
a
further
incentive
to
the
plaintiff.
so
here
we
have
congress
saying
we're
going
to
put
the
thumb
on
the
scales
here,
and
maybe
there's
other
provisions
where
we
extend
the
duration
of
copyright,
and
we
do
various
things
to
favor
copyright
owners,
but
when
it
comes
to
attorney's
fees,
it
doesn't
do
that.
it
doesn't
put
its
thumb
on
the
scales,
it
simply
says
the
court
may
award
to
the
prevailing
party,
and
that's
what
the
court
should
require
be
done
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honors.
