justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sidle,
isn't
it
true
that
in
190...
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1909.
isn't
that
when
the
language
got
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
at
that
time,
isn't
it
fair
to
assume
that
the
typical
case
congress
was
thinking
about
was
sort
of
a
garden
variety
infringement
suit,
or
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
argue
for
the
british
rule,
that
statute
has
been
on
the
books
for
87
years,
or
whatever
it
is,
and
nobody's
ever
adopted
the
british
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you...
what
standard
you
would
apply
if
the...
as
i
understand
it
there
are
counterclaims
in
this
case
back
and
forth--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
there
are
some
fairly
important
issues
on
which
your
client
lost.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
supposing
you
had
a
counterclaim
and
you
lost
on
a
lot
of...
they
spent
a
lot
of
time
and
attorney's
fees
on
that.
would
the
judge
have
had
discretion
to
award
fees
against
you
on
the
portions
of
the
case
that
they
prevailed
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
can
reduce
your
fees
on
issues
you
were
not
prevailing
on,
but
my
question
is
whether...
supposing
that
they...
even
though
on
the
bottom
line
you
won
in
this
case,
that
in
some
other
cross-claims
or
counterclaims,
they
were
successful
on
those,
and
there
was
much
more
attorney
time
and
effort
spent
on
those.
could
the
net
recovery
go
the
other
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
robbins,
can
i
interrupt?
i
just
want
to
ask
you
if
your...
you
said
there
was
no
change
in
the
language
in
'76.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
before
'76
costs
were
awarded
as
a
matter
of
course,
but
after
'76
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
true
that
attorney's
fees
are
now
a
part
of
costs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't...
if
they
were
awarded
automatically
before,
and
now
as
a
part
of
a
discretionary
award,
isn't
that
perhaps
of
significance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
now
the
whole
package
is,
it
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
say
they
were
ratifying
the
rule
that
existed
before,
one
rule
was
that
the
parties
were
not...
plaintiffs
and
defendants
had
the
same
standard
and
another
rule
was
they
didn't
have
the
same
standard.
which
of
the
two
were
they
ratifying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
what
the
register
of
copyrights
said
when
she
talked
about
this
issue
in
1976
she
used
precisely
the
same
standard
to
talk
about
both.
it's
on
page
49
of
your
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
"courts
have
generally
denied
fees
of...
awards
of
attorney's
fees
where
the
losing
party
had
solid
grounds
for
litigating
his
claim
or
defense.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
certainly
applies
the
same
standard
for
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
don't
want
us
to
answer
whether
there's
a
different
rule
or
not,
because
you
think
you
win
anyway--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
we
are
interested
in
whether
there's
a
difference--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
robbins,
wouldn't
you
say
that
it
may
be
not
the
typical,
but
in
a
large
number
of
copyright
cases
the
standard
would
be
met,
because
it's
perfectly
obvious
there
was
copying
and
they
just
didn't
expect
to
get
caught,
or
something?
aren't
there
a
lot
of
very
small-time
suits
in
this
area
where
there
really
isn't
a
defense,
and
there
has
to
be
a
motive,
but
the
amount
involved
isn't
enough
to
justify
the
recovery
unless
the
copyright
owner
brings
a
fee...
gets
fees,
so
that
even...
you
could
say
even
in
a
large
number
of
ordinary
cases,
fees
are
appropriate
in
this
area
for
the
plaintiff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
you
might
have
a
different
language
than
you
would
in
the
patent
case,
and
the
standard
could
still
be
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
of
course,
we
didn't
construe
it
till
long
after
the
copyright
fee-shifting
statute
was
drafted,
so
congress
could...
you
cannot
say
congress
could
have
predicted
we
would
have
construed
the
civil
rights
act
in
the
future
the
way
we
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
until
after
it
was
passed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
until
after
it
was
enacted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
argued
it
had
been
so
construed
up
until...
i
mean,
even
before
the
language
went
in
the
statute.
