unknown
speaker
why...
why
did
it
overrule
it?
it
simply
provided
a
different
statute
of
limitations,
and
what
congress
does
is
enact
statutes,
including
those
involving
limitations.
unknown
speaker
well,
they...
they
didn't...
you...
you
agree,
i
take
it,
they
didn't
do
what...
what
would
have
been
done
by
the
congress
in
hayburn's
case.
unknown
speaker
this...
this
was
not
an
instance...
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this
is
not
an
instance
in
which
there
was
an
individualized
action
by
congress
on
a
case-by-case
basis--
unknown
speaker
--to
revise
an
otherwise
ostensibly
final
decision
of
a
court.
unknown
speaker
so,
hayburn
is
no
authority
for
you,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
those
are
final
judgments
which,
as
judgments,
are
being
revised.
and
in
this
case
a
general
law
is
being
changed.
unknown
speaker
and
you
have...
i
mean,
do
you...
you
have
no
authority
from
this
court
with
respect
to
that
latter
proposition,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
benkard,
why
do
you
concede
that
no...
no
judgment
has
been
revised
by
the
statute?
the
statute
washes
out.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
did.
i
thought
the
question
was
that
this...
this
statute
did
not
revise
any
judgment.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
did.
unknown
speaker
it
wiped
out
judgments
that
were
on
the
books,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
think
what--
[laughter]
no,
i--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
benkard,
i
think
the...
i
think
the
devil...
i
don't
think
it's
your
lips
the
devil
has
got
here.
[laughter]
i...
i
think
your
concession
to
me
was
that
congress
had
not,
on
a
particularized
case-by-case
basis--
unknown
speaker
--revised
something.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
in...
in
hayburn's
case,
it
was
clear,
at
the
time
that
the
court
was
asked
to
resolve
the
dispute,
that
the
judgment
would
and
could
be
revised
by
the
congress.
there
was
almost
a
question
of
finality
there.
here
the
dispute
was
final
as
of
the
time
the
court
heard
it...
for
all
that
it
thought,
for
all
that
it
knew.
unknown
speaker
in
your...
in
our
case.
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
court
could
give
its
determination
without
fear
of
congress
revising
it
on
the
basis
that
the
court
decided
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
hayburn's,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
benkard,
you're
talking
about
the
timing
of
the
legislation.
i
would
like
you
to
consider
the
substance
of
the
legislation
that
is
in
hayburn's
case.
is
it
not
true
that,
effectively,
the
legislature
was
setting
itself
up
as
an
appellate
tribunal,
revising,
modifying
whatever
initial
decision
the
judiciary
made?
so,
the
judiciary
was
being
considered
as
sort
of
a
first
instance
tribunal,
and
then
came
the
legislature
or
the
executive...
i
forgot
which...
but,
anyway,
the
other
branches,
putting
themselves
over
the
judiciary
on
the
question
of
the
substantive
rights
of
the
claimant.
and--
unknown
speaker
--the...
but
the
actuality
is
what?
this
case
involves
a
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
so
that
as
between
the
judiciary
and
the
legislature,
statutes
of
limitations
are
in
the
legislature...
legislature's
court?
when
the
legislature
doesn't
act,
then
the
court
has
to
make
something
up,
and
feels
intensely
uncomfortable
doing
so
because
statutes
of
limitations
are,
by
their
nature,
arbitrary.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
due
process
argument.
that's
a...
that's
a
different
issue.
unknown
speaker
let's
stay
on
the
separation
of
powers
argument
for
the
moment,
if
you
would.
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
about
rule
60,
which--
unknown
speaker
--which
authorizes
the
setting
aside
of
judgments
within
a
certain
time
period.
that
is
purely
a
congressional
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
here...
here
congress
has
simply
provided
that
the
judiciary
shall
judge
whether
or
not
a
new
statute
of
limitations
applies,
and
then
decide
the
case
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
the
fact
that
you...
you
recognize
the
distinction,
and
i
think
you
were
quite
candid
to
do
so,
between
deciding
the
merits
of
the
a
case...
does
the
claimant...
is
the
claimant
entitled
to
a
pension
of
benefit
of
some
kind,
and
a
question
of
time,
where
we
agree
that
time
is
for
the
legislature...
statute
of
limitations
have
legislative
decision
written
all
over
them.
so,
it's
a
question
of
this
retroactivity.
and
i'm
wondering,
is
there
any
problem
about
separation
of
powers
or
due
process,
where
the
revival
statute...
a
statute
that
revives
the
claim
that
dies
with
a
decedent,
and
then
it's
revived?
unknown
speaker
oh,
that's
it.
but
isn't
that
the
distinction?
unknown
speaker
if
justice
ginsburg
is
talking
about
a
claim
that
has
expired
without
a
lawsuit
having
been
brought--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
distinguish
that
from
case
where
the
statute,
having
expired,
a
suit
is
brought
and
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
the
statute;
that's
a
different
situation?
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
just
the
holiness
of
the
judgment
that
you're
relying
on,
that--
unknown
speaker
--a
judgment
can't--
unknown
speaker
--well,
we've
told
congress
the
stat...
that,
in
effect,
that
its
statute
is
broken.
and
so,
congress
fixed
it.
unknown
speaker
but
it
seems
to
me
they
can
do
that
without
interfering
with
the
courts.
we
have
said
that
our
considered
judgment
under
this
statute
is
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a,
b,
c,
d.
unknown
speaker
and
no
one
quarrels
with
that.
that
is
final.
unknown
speaker
the
point
is
that
congress
can
alter
that
without
demeaning
or
interfering
with
this
court.
unknown
speaker
and
it
should
do
so
if
it
desires
a
different
result.
and
that
simply
brings
us
to
the
next
question,
which
is
the
due
process
question.
unknown
speaker
but
so
far
as
the
separation
of
powers
question,
i
see
no
interference.
unknown
speaker
mr.
benkard,
i...
i
assume
that,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
you...
you
would...
you
can
concede
that
it'd
be
a
different
matter
if
congress
simply
passed
a
longer
statute
of
limitations
which
would
allow
people
who...
even
people
who
had
already
sued
and
been
denied
because
of
the
old
statute
of
limitations
to
bring
a
new
suit...
raising
a
res
judicata
issue,
but
that's
a
different
issue?
do
you...
do
you
have
to
assert
that
it's--
unknown
speaker
--must
you
assert
that
it's
the
same
one
for
the
purpose
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
a
harder
question
than...
than--
unknown
speaker
--congress
setting
aside
a
judgment
of
the
court,
which
is...
which
is
what
happened
here.
it
set
aside
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
it
said
the
case
will
be
reopened.
unknown
speaker
don't...
you
don't
think
that's
a
harder
question
than--
unknown
speaker
--but
there's
one
point
on
the
due
process
side
that
i'd
like
you
to
address.
here
you're
talking
about
the
right
of
the
individual
to
the
benefit
of
that
judgment.
if
the
case
is
still
in
the
hopper
because
the
litigants
have
strung
it
out
or
because
the
plaintiff,
having
been
dismissed,
takes
an
appeal
that
plaintiff
knows
plaintiff
is
going
to
lose,
but
has
kept
the
case
alive--
unknown
speaker
--then
those
people
have
no
due
process
rights,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
the
people
who
deliberately
prolonged
protracted
litigation,
instead
of
accepting
the
dismissal.
isn't
what
happened
here
plaintiffs
who
came
in
with
the
expectation
that
the
claim
was
timely,
who
then
had
their
expectations
disappointed
by
this
court's
decision
in
lampf?
unknown
speaker
congress
responded
to
that
disappointment
and
provided
for
two
things:
cases
still
in
the
pipeline--
unknown
speaker
--so,
then
we're
dealing
with
the
people
who
are
unsophisticated,
rather
than
the
people
who
protract
it--
unknown
speaker
--the
people
who
are
unsophisticated,
those
plaintiffs
who
didn't
take
that
protective
appeal
or
cautious
appeal...
to
characterize
it
in
a
non-pejorative
way...
those
people,
the
sophisticated,
will...
those
plaintiffs
will
succeed,
whereas
the
ones
who
just
accepted
the
dismissal
lose?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court...
courts
can
do
that,
as
you
conceded,
all
the
time
under
60(b)6.
unknown
speaker
for
any
of
the
reasons
of
just
and
equitable,
they
can
reopen
a
final,
final
judgment,
right?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
you
know
what
we
would
do
with
it,
too.
[laughter]
because
there
would
be
an
individualized
revision
of
judgments
based
on
the
particular
application
of
law
to
the
facts
of
that
case.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
case
that
you
were
posing,
congress
was
doing
what
we
were
doing
under
60(b).
unknown
speaker
then
i
misunderstood
what
you
were
saying.
unknown
speaker
but
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
before
rule
60(b)
was
ever
enacted,
that
you
will
have
turmoil
if
you
allow
any
setting
aside
of
judgments.
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
but
in...
excuse
me--
--60(b)
wasn't
brand
new
anyway.
it...
it
was
an
embodiment
of
what
courts
had
been...
had
been
doing
traditionally
anyway,
with
some
further
specification
of
the
grounds
for
it.
but
courts
had
traditionally
asserted
the
power
to...
to
remove
their
own
judgments
for
certain
reasons,
had
they
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
came
within
the
judicial
power
under
traditional
understanding?
unknown
speaker
and
conversely,
you
don't
claim
that
what's
happening
here
is
what
would
happen
if
congress
exercise
a
60(b)
power?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
a
court
exercises
a
60(b)
power,
it's
looking
to
the
individualized
facts
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
and
applying
the
rule
of
law,
or...
or
opening
a
judgment
so
that
a...
a
rule
of
law
can
at
least
potentially
be
applied
differently.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
quite--
unknown
speaker
--i
quite
agree,
but
that
is
not
what
the
congress
is
doing
in
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--sioux
nation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
benkard,
why
doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
judiciary
violate
the
separation
of
powers
when
it
denies
congress
full
control
over
the
timeliness
of
a
statutory
claim,
claimed
as
a
creation
of
the
legislature,
the
timeliness
of
the
claim
is
a
legislative
judgment?
hasn't
the
court,
in
effect,
taken...
encroached
on
the
legislative
turf
by
taking
what
should
be
an
entirely
legislative
judgment...
what
is
the
claim
and
how
long
do
you
have
to
bring
it...
the
judiciary
has
cut
off
the
legislature's
right
to
determine
how
long
you
have
to
maintain
a
statutory
claim?
why
doesn't
that
violate
the
separation
of
powers?
why
isn't
that
the
judiciary?
unknown
speaker
who
is
overstepping?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
grounds
would
be
those
set
forth
in
my
dissent
in
lampf.
[laughter]
where
i
accused
the
court
of
doing
just
that
legislatively.
unknown
speaker
and
it...
it
occurs
to
me
that
you're
in
precisely
the
position
you
would
have
been
had
my
dissent
prevailed
in
lampf,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
benkard.
mr.
taranto,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
even
narrower
than
that,
mr.
taranto.
they...
they
may
not
have
a
constitut...
they...
it
is
possible
that
they
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
have
the
new
rule
apply
to
them,
but
they
may
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
have
it
apply
to
them
via
the
dissolution
of
judgments
that
they
have
received.
unknown
speaker
many
things
may
be
done
in
one
way
and
not
done
in
another.
a
state
law
that...
that
simply
expropriates
$2
million
from
every
tobacco
company
is
invalid.
a
state
law
that
taxes
every
tobacco
company
in
the
amount
of
$2
million
is
valid.
a...
a
judicial
decision
that
ignores
a
federal
statute
on
the
ground
that
it's
unconstitutional,
and
applies
the
rest
of
the
law
without
that
statute,
is
valid.
a
judicial
decision
that
directs
the
marshall
to
go
across
the
street
and
rip
that
statute
off
of
the...
off
of
the
books
of...
of...
the
statute
books
of
the
united
states
is
invalid.
unknown
speaker
there...
there's
a
right
way
and
a
wrong
way
to
do
things,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
can
congress,
which
is
dissatisfied
with
the...
with
the
outcome
of
a
particular
case
or
a
particular
class
of
cases,
simply
say
that
those
cases
shall
be
retried?
unknown
speaker
why
in
certain
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
i
read
sioux
nation
much
more
narrowly
than
that.
its
summation
of
its
holding
is,
in
sum,
congress'
mere
waiver
of
the
res
judicata
effect
of
a
prior
judicial
decision
rejecting
the
validity
of
a
legal
claim
against
the
united
states
does
not
violate
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
that's
its
summation.
unknown
speaker
here...
here
congress
is
legislating
not
for
its...
not
for
the
united
states,
but
for
private
individuals.
unknown
speaker
that
logic
may
be
correct,
mr.
taranto,
but...
but,
insofar
as
we
are
bound
by
stare
decisis,
all
that
sioux
nation
holds
is
that
that
can
happen
when
the
united
states
is
waiving
its
own...
its
own
right
to
res
judicata.
unknown
speaker
how
about
klein?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
that's
the
criterion,
then
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
only
thing
they
can't
do
is
decide
the
case
in...
in
your
view?
could
they
set
a--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
what...
what
about
changing
the
law
to
a
whole
class
of
cases
that
have
been
already
decided,
in
which
plaintiffs
have
won,
and
saying
we
are
now
changing
the
law
to
provide
for
an
affirmative
defense
of,
let's
say,
an
affirmative
defense
of...
of
good
faith
or
of
qualified
immunity,
and
all
those
plaintiffs
can
be
called
back...
the
judgments
will
be
dissolved,
the
cases
will
be
retried
with
this
new
defense.
can
congress
do
that?
unknown
speaker
it's
very
strange
that
they
haven't
done
that
more
often,
if
that's
been
so
available.
i
know
so
many
cases...
so
many
instances
when
they
would
have
liked
to
have
things
come
out
differently,
and
they
just
never
thought
they
could
do
that.
it's
nice
to
know.
unknown
speaker
no,
please;
and
when
you're
done,
i
have
a
question.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
just
touched
on...
on
something
which...
which
i
was
thinking
about.
and
i...
i
wonder
if
you
will
elaborate
on
it.
you...
you,
in
effect,
i
think,
just
said
there
is
a
point
at
which
the
separation
argument
and
the
due
process
argument
come
together.
and...
and
if
i
understood
what
you
were
saying,
you
were
saying
the...
the
reason
that
the
judgment,
as
such,
does
not
somehow
affect
the
outcome
of
the
argument...
the
reason
that
the...
that
the
judgment
is
not
sort
of
the
touchstone
of
what
is
or
is
not
the...
the
appropriate
separation
of
powers
analysis
is
that,
in
effect,
the
judgment...
i
think
you're
implying...
the
judgment
is...
is
simply
a
property
right
at
that
point.
and
because
not
every
interference
with
a
property
right
is
a
due
process
violation,
the
mere
fact
that
the
judgment
giving
rise
to
the
property
right
is
there
should
not,
for
separation
purposes,
be
regarded
as
dispositive
any
more
than
the
existence
of
a
property
right,
as
such,
should
be
regarded
as
dispositive
for
due
process.
is...
is
that,
in
a
crude
sort
of
way,
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
why
is
that
so?
why
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
or
why
shouldn't
it...
why
shouldn't
it
be
a
magic
moment?
unknown
speaker
arbitrary
because?
is...
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
one
of
your
broadest
answers
is
the
line
has
got
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
there
also
some
principle
that
the
congress
cannot
make
it
extraordinarily
difficult
for
this
branch
to
perform
its
functions?
i
can't
phrase
it
with
any
more
precision
than
that.
unknown
speaker
could
congress
abolish...
assuming
it
could
draw
a
statute
that
could
do
it...
abolish
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
i
take
it
one
of
the
principles
that
you
and
i
were
just
discussing,
with
reference
to
abolition
of
stare
decisis,
is
that
the
courts
cannot
function
effectively
unless
their
judgments
have
a
certain
degree
of
(a)
finality
and
(b)
respect.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
a
separation
of
powers
concept.
unknown
speaker
to
wit,
dissolved
existing
judgments.
why
is
not
dissolving
an
existing
judgment
a
judicial
act?
you...
you
gave
two
things
that
would
violate
separation
powers,
and
the
first
one
was
the
performance
of
a
judicial
act.
except...
i
don't
know
what
could
be
more
a
judicial...
it's
very
hard
to...
to
define
the
judicial
power,
but
if
there's
anything
central
to
it,
surely
it
is
the
entry
or
dissolution
of
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
i
just...
as
i
just
went
over
with
mr.
taranto,
there's
a
right
way
and
a
wrong
way
to
do
a
lot
of
things.
and...
and
the
mere
fact
that
you
can
achieve
the
same
result
in
another
fashion
doesn't
show
that
doing
it
in
this
fashion
is
all
right.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
follows
from
what...
and
this
relates
to
justice
kennedy's
question...
i
suppose
it
follows
from
what
you
say...
that
when
congress
disagrees
with
a
decision
of
this
court,
it
can...
you
know,
that
the
law
is
thus
and
so...
it
can
change
the
law
and
require
this
court
to
retry
the
same
case
under
the
new
law.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
don't
think
that
that
tends
to...
to
demean
the
judiciary?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
is
one
reason
why
this
is
a
novel
issue
the
relative
newness
of
being...
i
was
trying
to
think
whether
there
was
a
case
involving
the
stat...
change
in
the
court's
interpretation
of
what
the
legislature
wanted
in
the
way
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
where
the
court
itself
said,
applying
the
first
chevron
case...
chevron
against
huson...
but
we
are
not
going
to
cut
short
the
plaintiff's
rights
retroactively.
so,
this
rule
will
allow
plaintiffs
who
maintain
their
actions...
when
everyone
thought
it
was
timely
to
stay
in
court...
and
our
new
rules...
the
limitation,
should
be
three,
not
four,
years...
will
not
operate
retroactively.
was
there
any
such
decision
before?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
basis
for
beam
was
that
that
was
the
traditional
mode
of
judicial...
you're
not
really
saying
that
prospective
decisionmaking
has
been
the
tradition?
unknown
speaker
it's
pretty
novel
to...
to
say
we're
announcing
this
only
for
future
cases.
i
mean,
it
seems
that's
the
novelty,
not...
not
applying
things
retro--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
dreeben,
i'm
wondering
to
what
extent
your
argument
is
bottomed
entirely
in
the
fact
that
this
is
a
statute
of
limitations
case?
would
your
reasoning
apply
equally
if
congress
should
tonight
enact
a
statute
reviving
the
aiding
and
abetting
cause
of
action
under
10b-5,
and
do
it
in
a
similar
fashion?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
does
the
government
have
any
case
other
than
sioux
nation
in...
in
which
congress
has
done
this...
set
aside
an
extant
judgment?
unknown
speaker
the
government
was
a
party?
unknown
speaker
no
case,
in...
in
which
a
private
party
was
a
party
to
the
judgment,
has
congress
ever
tried
to
set
it
aside?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
know
of
any?
unknown
speaker
but
when
it
treats
it
as
a
disfavored
way,
as
it
did
in
sioux
nation,
there
is
certainly
no
problem.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
benkard,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
statute
is
not
self-executing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
benkard,
i
wanted
to
get
your
position
clear
on
one
question.
suppose
congress,
instead
of
doing
what
it
had
done
in
this
transition
period,
had
said
this
particular
claim,
this
10b-5
claim,
has
a
life
of
four
years.
all
claims
that
were
initially
brought
before
x
date
has...
have
a
life
of
four
years.
if
congress
had
done
that,
there
would
be
no
preclusion
doctrine
operating
against
the
plaintiff,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
on
the
then-statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
saying
that
congress
simply
cannot
prolong
a
statute
of
limitations
once
a
judgment
has
been
rendered?
unknown
speaker
on
behalf
of
the
court
i
also
have
the
judgment
to
announce
in
no.
93-609,
morgan
stanley

the
pacific
mutual
life
insurance
company.
justice
o'connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case,
and
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
