mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
well
established
that
congress
has
broad
legislative
power
to
enact
new
laws
to
reach
past
events,
specifically
including
a
new
statute
of
limitations
to
allow
plaintiffs
who
are
out
of
time
under
old
law
an
opportunity
to
recover
from
defendants
charged
with
wrongful
conduct...
here,
securities
fraud.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
those
defendants,
who
have
obtained
a
final
judgment
under
the
old
rule,
have
acquired
a
constitutional
immunity
from
application
of
the
new
rule
to
them.
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
separation
of
powers
or
due
process
problem
with
equal
treatment
of
those
defendants,
along
with
those
who
happen
to
have
cases
still
pending.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
is
possible,
but
i
can't,
frankly,
think
of
a
single
case
in
which
this
court
has
made
a
decision,
in
particular,
on
separation
of
powers
turned
on
what
is,
in
essence,
a
non-constitutional
formality.
and
if
i
look...
if
we
look
back
at
robertson
against
seattle
audubon
society,
the
court
specifically
said,
we
look
at
the
substance
of
what
congress
did.
and
here,
the
substance
is
identical
to
a
statute
that
says,
the
following
class
of
plaintiff
shall
have
a
new
10b-5
prime
cause
of
action.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think,
justice--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
in...
in
robertson,
the...
the
legislation
was
written,
it
seems
to
me,
in
a
way
that
is
much
more
troublesome
under
separation
of
powers
doctrine
than
this.
the
legislation
said,
the
following
statutory
requirements
shall
be
deemed
satisfied
by
meeting
certain
conditions.
the
fundamental
distinction
between
legislation
and
adjudication,
i
think
as
this
court
said
in
robertson,
as
your
own
concurrence,
i
think
in
freitag,
reflects,
as
the
court
said
in
the
procedural
due
process
portion
of
concrete
pipe,
is
the
difference
between
making
law
and,
on
the
other
hand,
interpreting
and
applying
law
to
particular
facts
and
finding
facts.
and
the
fundamental
point
i
think
about
this
statute
is
that
it
is
legislative
equally,
whether
congress
applied
it
to
pending
cases
or
to
final
cases.
the
reason
that
this...
that
there
is
no
challenge
in
this
case
to...
or
in...
in
any
event,
it
is
now
conceded,
as
seven
circuits
have
held...
that
section
27a
is
fully
legislative,
as
applied
to
pending
cases,
is
that
the
relevant
constitutional
line
has
to
do
with
the
difference
between
adjudication
and
legislation.
and
that
line
is
no
more
crossed
when
congress
acts
with
respect
to
pending
or
final
cases.
indeed,
our
submission
is
that
if
congress...
to
take
justice
stewart...
justice
souter's
example...
undertook
to
consider
the
particular
facts
of
a
particular
case,
and
to
apply
the
law
itself
to
that
case,
that
would
be
equally
unconstitutional
in
a
pending
case
as
it
would
in
a
final
case.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
that
is...
is...
it
can
in
certain
circumstances.
that,
i
think--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--because
i
think
when
one
follows
the
sioux
nation
analysis...
sioux
nation
necessarily
rests
on
two
propositions.
the
first
is
that
a
change
of
law
to
reopen
judgments,
by
itself,
is
not
the
exercise
of
judicial
power.
the
second
proposition...
and
this
is
what
the
entire
waiver
discussion
in
sioux
nation
concerns...
is
to
identify
the
source
of
congress'
particular
power
to
change
particular
law.
in
sioux
nation,
the
particular
law
changed
was
exactly
res
judicata
law.
and
this
court
said,
res
judicata
law
may
be
changed
by
congress
when
it
is
essentially
waiving
its
own
right
not
to
pay
money.
this
case
involves
a
change
of
law
obviously
within
congress'
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
set
a
limitation
period
for
10b...
10b-5.
but
the
finality
principle...
namely,
the
idea
that
a
change
of
law
to
reopen
a
judgment
does
not
exercise
judicial
power...
i
think
stands
entirely
independently.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
i...
i...
that's
exactly
right.
but
i...
i
don't
think
that
the
separation
of
powers
point,
that
the
reopening
of
a
judgment
by
a
change
of
law
is
not
the
exercise
of
judicial,
is
dependent
on
the
fact
that
the
united
states
is
a
party
there,
any
more
than
pope
against
united
states
or
cherokee
nation,
or
the
various
cases
in
which
this
court
upheld
against
these
kinds
of
challenges,
legislation
reopening
territorial
court
judgments,
where
there
were
private
defendants.
i
think
the
private
defendant
has
to
do
with
two
things...
one,
the
due
process
issue,
and,
two,
the
source
of
the
particular
legislative
power
to
change
res
judicata
law.
there
may
well
be
limits
on
congress'
power,
with
respect
to
private
cases,
simply
to
say,
do
it
again.
in...
when
the
united
states...
when
money
claims
against
the
united
states
are
involved,
i
think
that's
not
problematical.
if,
for
example,
there
were
a
legislative
determination
that
a
whole
raft
of
cases
were
decided
under
now
clearly
incorrect
science
and
they
should
be...
and
they,
in
essence,
weren't
fairly
tried...
i
think
that
might
be
within
the
power.
but
here
we
don't
have
a
question
of
the
legislative
power
to
change--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
i...
i
utterly
agree
that
there
is
no
holding
of
this
court
directly
applicable
to
this
case.
i
think
the
entire
line,
for
example,
of
the
hayburn's
case
princ...
cases
have
to
do
with
advisory
opinions
and
are
irrelevant
here.
the
closest
i
think
this
court
has
come
are
the
two
lines
of
cases...
sioux
nation
and
its
predecessors,
pope
and
cherokee,
and
the
territorial
court
cases.
and
i
agree
that
the
holdings
of
those
cases
do
not
answer
this
question.
but
i
do
think
that
the
principles
of
those
cases
do.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i...
klein,
i
think,
has
quite
wisely
not
been
argued
in...
in
this
court
precisely
because,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
robertson
against
seattle
audubon
society,
this
is
a
case
in
which
congress
changed
the
law
applicable
to
a
class
of
cases
and
did
not
simply
direct
the
courts
to
enter
a...
a
particular
decision
by
making
an
adjudicatory
decision.
now,
on--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think...
i
think
that
there...
that
there
are
elements
of
adjudication...
principally,
two,
i
think...
finding
facts
that
are
elements
of
a
cause
of
action
and
interpreting
or
applying,
rather
than
changing
the
law.
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think,
as
a
matter
of
substantive
due
process
and
as
a
matter
of
separation
of
powers,
yes,
i
think
congress--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i...
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
the
longstanding
presumption
against
retroactive
legislation,
including,
i
think,
this
kind,
reflects
deep-seated
fairness
concerns
that
is
what,
over
the
years,
in
fact,
inhibits
congress
or
other
legislatures
from
doing
this
sort
of
thing
on
any
kind
of...
in
any...
in
any
way
that
would
have
generated
this
precise
case
in
this
court
before.
so,
it's
not
in
fact
to
be
expected
that
congress
would
do
this
on...
on
any
number
of
occasions.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
let
me...
let
me
see
if
i
can
respond
this
way.
i
think,
for
separation
of
powers
purposes,
there
is
no
charismatic
significance
to
a
judgment,
because
the
underlying
principles
that
separate
article
i
from
article
iii
really
don't
make
the
magic
moment
of
the
judgment
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
somebody
has
been
denied
a
politically
independent
adjud--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think,
in
part,
because
it
produces
what,
to
my
mind,
are
arbitrary
and
indeed
upside-down
results--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--because...
because
they...
the
distinction
between
congress
acting
with
respect
to
a
pending
case
and
congress
acting
with
respect
to
a
case
that
has
finally
come
to
an
end
doesn't,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
either
reflect
anything
in
the
text...
unlike
the
formal
lines
relined
on
in
chada
and
bowsher
and
that
line
of
cases,
or
the
underlying
constitutional
principle.
there
are
political
judgments
to
be
made
in
saying
what
the
limitations
period
is.
there
are
in...
politically
independent
fact
finding
and
law
interpreting
functions
to
be
performed
by
the
courts...
which
is
what
article
iii
guarantees...
and
i
don't
see
that
whether
a
particular
matter
is
pending
or
has
come
to
an
end
has
any...
anything
to
do
with
those.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
by
looking
at
whether
what
congress
has
done
is
to
make
a
adjudicatory
decision,
whether
it
acts
too
narrowly,
whether
it
explicitly
changes
the
law,
whether
it
makes
very
case
specific
kind
of
fact
findings.
here,
i
don't
think
we're
even
near
that
boundary.
and
that's
why
there's
no
dispute
any
longer
about
the
validity
of
27a
as
to
pending
cases.
now,
on
the
due
process
side,
it
seems
to
me
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
two
different
roles
judgments
can
play.
a
judgment
can
create
a
new
right...
a
right
in
a
judgment...
like
a
judgment
lien.
but
i
don't
understand
that
there's
been
any
argument
that
that
kind
of
property
right
should
somehow
be
treated
as
more
sacrosanct
than
the
right
of
title
to
property
or
a
contract
right.
the
other
kind
of
right
is
what's
talked
about
in
all
the
cases
concerning
rights
vested
by
a
judgment.
and
the
judgment
there
simply
plays
the
role
of
confirming
the
legal
entitlement.
and
it
seems
to
me,
again,
upside-down
to
say
that
if
the
legal
entitlement
was
so
clear
and
indisputable
that
it
never
gave
rise
to
litigation
in
the
first
place,
that
is
subject
only
to
due
process
rationality;
whereas
if
it
was
sufficiently
disputable
and
ambiguous
that
litigation
resulted,
that
somehow
the
result...
again,
the
underlying
right
is
the
property
right...
is
protected
as
sacrosanct
when...
when
a
judgment
has
finally
said,
well,
on
balance,
the
right
view
of
the
existing
legal
entitlements
is
that
you
indeed
have
them.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
exactly
backwards,
in
terms
of
a
role
of
a
judgment.
and
here,
the
judgment
itself
is
being...
is
being
raised
to
a
level,
by
view...
by
reference
to
all
of
the
vested
rights
cases...
that
indeed
other
vested
rights,
like
contract
rights
and
property
rights
are...
are...
have
been
held
specifically
by
this
court
to
be
subject
to
the
rationality
test.
and,
of
course,
this
case
doesn't
involve
other
specific
constitutional
provisions,
like
the
takings
clause
or
the
contract
clause,
where
vested
rights
of
a
specific
sort
may
have
additional
legal
protection.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
