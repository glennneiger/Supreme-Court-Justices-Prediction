mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
separation
of
powers
principles
that
apply
to
this
case
really
are
two.
the
first
is
of
course
that
congress
cannot
itself
exercise
judicial
power
that
is
given
to
the
article
iii
court.
the
second
principle,
which
is
the
hayburn's
case
principle,
is
that
congress
cannot
require
the
federal
courts
to
engage
in
a
form...
advisory
opinion
rendering
by
rendering
non-binding
determinations
that
some
other
branch
of
government...
either
the
executive
branch
or
congress...
then
reviews.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
there
is
a
principle
that...
that
congress
cannot,
by
a
variety
of
mechanisms,
that...
that
may
not
be
easy
to
specify,
weaken
the
judicial
branch
to
the
point
where
it...
it
cannot
perform
its
function
at
all.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would
have
difficulty
understanding
a
rational
basis
for
congress
to
abolish
stare
decisis
entirely.
and
it
might
be
difficult
for
such
a
doctrine
to
survive
even
due
process
review.
as
a
matter
of
article
iii
jurisprudence,
a
total
abolition
of
stare
decisis
might
be
one
of
those
rare
type
of
actions
that
would
so
weaken
the
judicial
branch
that
you
don't
have
a...
a
functioning
court
system
in
the
sense
that
the
constitution
contemplates
judicial
power.
but
the
point
that
i...
i
wanted
to
get
to
here
is
that
the
very
specific
action
that...
that
congress
took
in
section
27a,
subsection
(b),
of
requiring
the
reinstatement
of
a
very
limited
class
of
securities
fraud
cases
doesn't
violate
any
of
the
principles
that
we've
been
discussing.
it
doesn't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
agree
with
both
of
those
propositions,
but
i
think
the
key
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it
is
at
the
margins.
but
i
think
that
the
key
is...
is
a
certain
degree
of
finality.
this
statute
does
not
rob
judicial
decisions
en
masse
of
finality.
what
it
does
is
says
that
as
to
a
particular
class
of
cases,
where
congress
concededly
has
the
power
to
change
the
law,
congress
exercises
the
power
to
change
the
law.
and
then,
rather
than
requiring
plaintiffs
to
refile
wholly
new
cases
based
on
new
statutory
causes
of
action,
which
it
also
clearly
has
the
power
to
create,
congress
adopted
a
much
more
precise
procedural
mechanism
for
getting
the
claim
back
into
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
this
statute,
of
course,
does
not,
in
terms...
to
use...
to
use
the
formal
terms
of
the
statute...
it
does
not
dissolve
a
judgment.
it
is
not
a
judicial
decree
that
says
the
judgments
in
x
case
or
x
class
of
cases
are
dissolved.
what
it
does
is
provide
what
is,
in
effect,
rule
60(b)(7),
that
says
that
a
plaintiff
who
has
the...
has
had
a
final
judgment
entered
against
him,
but
has
a
change
in
statutory
law
that
entitles
the
plaintiff's
claim
to
succeed
whereas
before
it
failed,
may
go
back
to
court.
and
the
court,
upon
motion
of
the
plaintiff,
shall
reinstate
the
judgment.
and
formality
does
matter
in
this
sense.
i
think
that
this
statute
is
fully
consistent
with
the
general
trend
of
rule
60(b)
law,
which
congress
would
clearly
have
the
power
to
enact.
60(b)
may
not
right
now
be
generally
interpreted
to
permit
the
reinstatement
of
cases
based
on
changes
in
statutory
law.
but
i
see
no
reason
whatsoever
why
congress
could
not
enact,
as
a
procedural
housekeeping
measure,
a
60(b)(7)
that
i've
described
that
would
allow
reinstatement
of
the
case.
and
that's
if
you
characterize
it
as
a
procedural
avenue...
namely,
the
procedural
avenue
of
reinstatement.
if
you
characterize
it,
on
the
other
hand,
as
a
substantive
act...
namely,
congress
wanted
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
to
enjoy
the
substantive
right
to
be
able
to
litigate
their
securities
fraud
cases
on
the
merits
after
they
had
been
thrown
out
of
court
by
what
congress
viewed
was
a
surprise,
to
them
at
least,
in
the
way
that
the
law
evolved,
then
the
substance
of
what
congress
did
is
to
create
a
new
cause
of
action,
a
new
right
to
proceed
in
court.
and
the
fact
that
it
did
so
in
a
manner
that
required
the
reinstatement
of
a
pending
case,
rather
than
the
filing
of
a
wholly
new
complaint
should
not
be
deemed
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
what
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
when
it
changes
the
law
and
requires
a...
a
new
trial
of
the
case
it's
not
really
a
new
trial.
i
mean,
it
is
a...
a
new
claim
that's
being
pursued
under
the
new
law.
and
i
don't
see
any
impediment
to
that
occurring
whatsoever
either,
as
a
matter
of
article
iii
jurisprudence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
not
at
all.
the
judiciary's
function,
particularly
when
we're
dealing
here
with
an
area
of
statutory
law,
rule
10b-5,
which
was
created
by
the
judiciary...
it
did
not
have
an
express
statute
of
limitations.
this
court
stepped
in
to
supply
what
it
viewed
as...
as
post
hoc
legislative
intent
of
what
congress
would
have
done.
then
congress,
which
is
clearly
the
proper
body
to
provide
a
statute
of
limitations
for
a
statutory
cause
of
action,
said
what
that
limitations
period
will
be.
and
it
determined
that
the...
the
limitations
period,
retroactively,
would
be
the
limitations
period
that...
that
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants
had
assumed
to
be
the
law
before
this
court's
decision
in
lampf.
that
is
an
exercise
of
lawmaking
power
pure
and
simple.
it...
it
is
clearly
legislative.
the
courts
are
left
with
tasks
that
are
entirely
judicial.
a
motion
is
made
to
the
court
under
an
existing
statute,
section
27a,
requesting
reinstatement
of
the
case.
if
the
party
has
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
law,
the
case
is
reinstated
and
the
action
then
proceeds
to
trial
on
the
merits.
and
ultimately,
the
courts
will
render
judgments
that...
that
are
reflective
of
the
facts
that
are
found
in
the
cases
and
the
application
of
law
based
on
the
securities
laws.
the
courts
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
justice
ginsburg.
and
i...
i
think
that
your
speculation,
that
the
interaction
of
lampf
and
beam
were
the
direct
source
of
section
27a,
is
probably
correct.
until
this
court
had
decided
beam,
it
probably
would
have
not
applied
a
new
statutory
holding
as
to
a
statute
of
limitations
that
shortened
the
period
retroactively
to
other
cases
in
the
system.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
on
the
contrary,
what
i
am
saying
is
that,
under
this
court's
decision
in
chevron
v.
huson,
the
court
had
refrained
from
applying
a
new
statute
of
limitations
backwards
within
the
system
to
throw
out
cases
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
had...
it
had
been
the...
the
way
that
the
court
had
operated
for
many
years.
and
i
think
that
it
explains
why
there
have
been,
particularly
since
chevron
v.
huson
has
been
decided,
why
there
have
been
few,
if
any,
opportunities
for
congress
really
to
consider
the
need
to
frame
what
is,
in
essence,
a
transition
legislative
rule
between
the
old
regime
under
which
the...
the
lampf
holding
was
that
the
i/iii
rule
would
prevail,
to
the
new
regime,
which
is
that
lampf
goes
forward
and
displaces
state
law.
so,
congress,
in
effect,
revived
the
state
law
statutes
of
limitations,
which
were
the
expectations
of
the
parties
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think,
justice
stevens,
as
to
separation
of
powers,
the...
the
cases
are
indistinguishable.
any
time
that
congress
changes
the
law
and
determines
that
the
law
should
be
applied
to
cases
that...
that
are
technically
final
within
the
system,
that
there
be
no
different
issue
as
to
a
plaintiff's
side,
defendant's
side.
whether
there
is
a
difference
under
any
other
doctrine
in
the
constitution,
such
as
the
due
process
clause
or
the
takings
clause,
raises
a
more
difficult
question.
this
court
has
previously
rejected
a
vested
rights
due
process
argument
that
a
plaintiff
made,
in
the
freeland
v.
williams
case,
which
was
in
the
19th
century,
where,
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
had
won
a
judgment.
he
had
not
executed
it.
virginia
or
west
virginia,
i
believe,
changed
the
law
so
as
to
preclude
him
from
executing
the
judgment.
and
this
court
upheld
it,
finding
no
due
process
violation
when
the
legislature
chooses
to
change
a
law,
even
in
such
a
way
that
it
wipes
out
a
plaintiff's
right.
and
of
course,
the
fleming
v.
rhodes
case,
more
recently,
which
is
the
case
that
makes
clear
that
whatever
rights
that
are
vested
in
a
judgment
are
on
a
par
with
other
economic
rights,
which
congress
may
retroactively
regulate,
provided
that
it
has
the
rational
basis
for
doing
it.
that
case,
i
think,
also
establishes
that
plaintiffs,
in
general,
are
not
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
there
may
be
a
harder
case...
cases
in
the
margins,
that
would
raise
takings
claims.
this
case,
i
think,
clearly
raises
no
specter
of
a
taking
whatsoever.
there
is
no
tradition
or
any
source
of
law
that
the
petitioners
can
point
to
that
says
that
a
judgment
that
rests
on
a
statute
of
limitations
is
somehow
a
species
of
property.
the
right
not
to
litigate
a
claim
on
the
merits
is...
is
not
regarded
as
the
kind
of
property
that...
that
the
government
would
take.
in
any
event,
it's
not
clear
how
the
government
acquired
this
right,
even
if
it
is
one.
and
it's
certainly
not
a
case
where
it
would
be
unfair
to
require
petitioners
to
assume
the
burden
of
litigating
on
the
merits
their
securities
fraud
case
and
paying
a
judgment
if
in
fact
they...
they
committed
securities
fraud
under
what
everybody
acknowledges
is
preexisting
liability.
this
is
not
something
that
the
public
should
bear,
rather
than
petitioners.
so,
i
don't
see
this
case
as
raising
any
takings
problem
either.
congress
does
act
circumspectly
in
changing
the
law
with
respect
to
cases
that
have
gone
final.
because
there
is,
of
course,
a
well
settled
distinction
in
the
law
between
pending
cases
and
final
cases.
but
it
is
not
of
constitutional
dimension
for
purposes
of
article
iii.
there
are
other
settings
in
which
what
is,
in
essence,
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata;
the
doctrine
of
repose
is
overridden
by
a
congressional
determination
that
relitigation
of
a
claim
should
go
forward.
section
2255
in
the
criminal
area
is
an
example
of
that.
the
sioux
nation
case
is
an
example
of
that,
where
government
debts
are
involved.
and
i
think
the
same
principle
is
equally
applicable
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
other
cases
that...
that
were
the
ones
that
sioux
nation
relied
on,
which
are
also
cases
in
which
the
government
was--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--so--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
no
case.
but
we
rely...
we
don't
rely--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
we
don't
rely
on
any
precedent
of
this
court
that
says
that.
i
don't
think,
for
separation
of
powers
purposes,
it
should
make
a
difference.
in
fact,
if
there
should
be
any
litigant
whose
ability
to
require
the
federal
courts
to
relitigate
issues
should
be
most
suspect
it
would
probably
be
the
united
states.
because
the
united
states
would
have
the...
the
greatest
capacity
to,
in
some
way,
undermine
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
by
treating
its
cases
in
some
sort
of
a
favored
way.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
no
problem
except
to
the
extent
that
the
principle
that
is
at
issue
is
the
independent
of
the
courts
to
render
final
judgments
on
particular
claims
that
shall
never,
under
any
circumstances,
be
relitigated
again.
thank
you.
