mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
contend
that
section
27a
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
violates
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
insofar
as
section
27a
permits
the
reopening
of
final
judgments
granted
to
private
parties
in
actions
that
are
entirely
closed.
the
issues
before
this
court
are
whether
the
statute
constitutes
an
impermissible
infringement
upon
the
principle
of
the
separation
of
powers
and
upon
the
powers
of
the
judiciary
and
upon
the
individual
rights
of
those
litigants
who
appears
before
the
courts.
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
and
the
tenth
circuits,
as
well
as
seven
district
courts
who
have
been
faced
with
this
issue,
have
recognized
that
this
statute
is
in
irreconcilable
conflict
with
rules
of
law
handed
down
by
venerable
and
respected
precedents
of
this
court.
consequently,
they
have
held
that
the
statute
violates
the
constitution.
the
fifth
circuit,
from
whose
order
we
appeal,
reached
a
contrary
conclusion
in
large
part
on
the
basis
of
their
holding
that
it
was
quite
permissible
for
congress
to
compel
the
courts
to
share
parts
of
their
judicial
power
with
the
congress.
we
submit
that
that
holding
is
unprecedented.
it
is
wrong.
and
it
should
be
reversed.
now,
as
i
have
said,
our
challenge
is
based
upon
two
related
grounds.
the
first
is
the
separation
of
powers
principle
as
set
forth
in
article
iii,
and
as
early
and
authoritatively
interpreted
and
implemented
by
this
court
in
hayburn's
case.
there
is
no
question
but
that
section
27a
constitutes
such
an
intrusion
or
an
interference.
secondly,
there
is
the
point
of
the
rights
of
the
individuals
which
we...
we
contend
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
in
essence,
terminating
federal
securities
claims
against
the
petitioners
constitutes
a
divestment
of
our
due
process
rights.
there
is
no
issue
that
section
27a
was
passed
in
direct
reaction
to
this
court's
decision
in
beam
and
lampf.
indeed,
the
respondent
set
forth
at
some
length
the
legislation
reactions...
some
might
say
it
was
overblown...
but,
in
any
event,
there
was
no
discussion
that
we
can
find,
and
respondents,
i
don't
believe,
have
cited
any,
of
the
constitutional
problems
which
bring
us
here
today.
we
do
know
that
a
statute
was
passed
which
overruled
beam,
in
essence...
or
at
least
the
part
of
the
statute
that
we
are
here
today
on--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--but
they
can't
reverse
undue
final
judgments,
justice
souter.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
what
they--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
it...
it
is,
your
honor,
in
that
hayburn's
case
treats
the
broader
principle
of
the
powers
of
the
judiciary
being
infringed
by
congress,
whether
or
not
the
statute
preexists
or
comes
after
the
judgment
at
issue.
there
are
scores
of...
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
which
have
interpreted
hayburn's
case
in
that
way.
that...
where
they
state
that
the
congress
has
no
power,
as
we
understand
it,
to
revise
final
judgments
of
this
court.
whether
or
not--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
a--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--your
honor,
we
have...
we
have
the
authority
in
gordon
and
in
o'grady,
if
you
will,
your
honor,
which
we
believe
hold
that
when
any
law
is
passed
by
congress,
whether
it
be
new
or
old,
it
cannot...
it
cannot
infringe
upon
a
final
judgment
which
has
been
rendered
by
this
court.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
your
honor,
forgive
me.
i
did
not
mean
to
make--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
oh,
no.
no.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
the
devil
has
my
lips,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
i...
i--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--that
is
correct.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
but
they
have
revised
these
judgments,
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
well,
the
dispute...
the
dispute
in...
in
this
case,
your
honor,
or
in
hayburn's?
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
the
case
was...
was,
in
essence,
over
before
section
27a
was
enacted.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
that...
there's
no
question,
your
honor.
and
this
is
an
argument
that
respondent,
pacific
mutual,
makes:
that
somehow
it
makes
a
difference
that
a
statute
comes
afterwards
and
strips
a
final
judgment
from
a
party,
as
opposed
to
coming
before.
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
we
say
the
interference
is
worse
when
it
comes
in
the
latter
situation.
at
least
in
the...
in
the
previous
one,
the
parties
have
some
chance;
they
have
some
knowledge
it's
coming.
when
the
statute
comes
afterwards,
it...
it
has
divested
the
power
of
the
judiciary
even...
even
more
so.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
correct.
there
was
the
potential
for
that,
your
honor.
here
it's
an
actuality.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
correct.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
correct.
your
honor,
of
course,
you
had
to
set
the
statute
of
limitations
here.
and
then
congress
didn't
like
the
way
you
did
it,
and
changed...
and
changed
the
law.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
we're
not
saying
that
we
have
a
vested
right,
if
you
will...
getting
to
another...
the
later
issue
in
the
statute
of
limitations...
we're
saying
we
have
a
vested
right...
or
whatever
the
right
is
that
deserves
the
protection
of
the
constitution...
to
the
judgment
which--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--but...
it
may
be,
your
honor--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--i
certainly
will.
i
mean,
you
understand,
i
don't
look
on
these
two
as
scylla
and
charybdis.
i
look
on
them
as
fortifying
doctrines.
there's
no
question
that
the
separation
of
powers
appears
first
in
our
brief,
if
you
will,
because
i
can
see
getting
into
the
whole
vested
rights
briar
patch.
but
i
do
not
think
that
has
to
be
done
here.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
isn't
so
much
the
statute
itself
that
we
say
is
ours
and
ours
forever,
it
is
the
judgment
entered
on
the
basis
of
that
statute
that
deserves
the
respect
of
the
congress.
and
there's
absolutely
no
question...
it's
on
its
face--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--rule
60
being?
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
but
it
is
for
you
to
do,
your
honors.
it's
not
for
the
congress.
the
congress
has
no
power
to
come
in,
as
they
have...
your
honor,
i
really
want
to
get
back
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
not
just
the...
congress
can't
say,
well,
we
have
decided,
under
60(b),
that
a
darn
good
showing
has
been
made
by
the...
by
the
appellants,
and
therefore
we're
going
to
reopen
the
judgment.
609(b)
is
within
the
province
of
the
judiciary
to
decide
on
a
variety
of
reasons:
equity,
discretion--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--if
i
may
segue
then,
they
have
in
fact
operated,
as
i
believe
you
pointed
out
in
your
dissent
in
sioux
nation,
they
have
operated
as
an
appellate
court.
they
have
told
you...
they
have
told
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
well,
we're
now
going
to
decide
that
this
case
should
be
remanded,
that
it
should
be
dealt
with.
that's
with
this
court
does
often.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
same
kind
of
claim,
your
honor.
unless
it
is,
in
essence,
blessed
by
a
judgment,
i
can
see
a
distinction.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
correct.
it
can
be.
we
know
that
from
chase
v.
donaldson.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
we
know
it
from
a
variety
of
cases.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
absolutely.
yes.
and
chase
v.
donaldson
so
made
that
distinction,
as
have
many
of
the
courts
below.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
that's--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--absolutely.
that's
what
the
courts
are
all
about.
we
are
here
in
this
building
to
serve
you,
to
serve
the
principles
of
finality.
if
congress
can
come
here
when
they
don't
like
a
result
and
say,
all
we're
doing
is
remanding
it
back
to
have
another
look
at
it,
and
if
we
have
some
kind
of
a
sharing
of
judicial
authority,
you
get
two
things:
first,
you
get...
you
get
an
erosion
of
the
autonomy,
it
seems
to
me,
of
this
court
and
the
courts...
the
other
courts
as
well.
not
only
that,
you
get
institutional
disharmony.
here
you
have
the
courts
of
the
united
states
doing
the
best
they
can
to
come
down
with
decisions.
people
spend
time,
money,
whatever
to
come
and
get
those
decisions.
and
you
render
final
relief.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
fine.
they
can
fix
it
for
pending
cases.
and
that's
the
27a--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--you--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--it
is
final--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--it--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
well,
i...
i,
with
the
greatest
respect,
i
see
all
the
interference
in
the
world.
we
see
a
bright
line
here
between
the
situation
where
there
is
a
judgment
entered
on
whatever
the
old
law
is.
the
moving
hand
has
writ
under
those
circumstances.
and
if
congress
can
come
back
and
tell
you,
no,
you
got
the
statute
of
limitations
wrong,
not
only
will
it
be
different
for
future
cases,
but,
for
past
cases
as
well.
why
can't
they
do
it
for
contributory
negligence?
why
can't
they
just
change
the
burden
of
proof?
why
can't
they
change
the
rules
of
evidence?
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
wait...
no,
wait
a
minute--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--i'm
not
sure
i
have
to.
i
think
i
have
my
lips
back.
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
necessary
concession
for
me
to
make.
what
i
believe
your
honor
is
saying
is,
why
couldn't
congress
have
just
passed
a
new
statute
and
give...
given
the
new
remedy
to
the
people
whose
judgments
it
already--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--much.
but
i
still
think--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--absolutely.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
i
say
it
can't
do
it.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
i
do
think
it's
a
harder
question.
i
don't
think
it's
any...
we
have
also
treated
it
at
some
length
in
our...
in
our
brief
because
it
was
raised
by
the
other
side.
i...
there
are
a
variety
of
responses
to
it,
one
of
which
comes
out
of
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
the
ninth
circuity,
in
chada,
where
he
said
that
one...
just
because
you
can
do
the
greater
doesn't
mean
you
can
do
the
lesser.
but
there
are
a
variety
of
other
questions...
namely,
the
res
judicata
one.
and
i
also
would
argue
at
the
end...
i'm
glad
i
don't
have
to
here...
but
i...
i
have
a
feeling
that
after
the
denver
decision
on
the
aiding
abetting
point
that
in
fact
there
may
be
a
little
deja
vu
here,
which
i
think
justice
stevens
noted
in
his
dissent.
but
when
that...
when
that
issue
comes,
i
hope
congress
is
somewhat
the
wiser
from
what
has
happened
here.
i
wonder
if
i
might
spend
a
moment
on
sioux
nation--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--right.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
when
you
say,
those
people
have
no--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--mm-hm.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
i
understand.
your
honor,
i've
been
doing
this
for
30
years,
and
i
have
filed
a
certain
amount
of
appeals
in
my
time
that
certain
people
have
said
to
me,
gosh,
they're
not
really
valid
or
whatever.
litigation
is
never
over
until
a
certain
person
sings.
and--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--well--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--i
don't
want
to
fence
with
you,
your
honor,
but
a
lot
of
sophisticated
and
unsophisticated
people
took
appeals
here
during
the
pendency
of
the
discussions
in
congress
concerning
27a.
and
they
are
in
a
different
situation.
but
if
you
push
me
to
it,
and
i'm
happy
to
accept
that,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
at
some
point
you
have
to
draw
a
bright
line.
and,
indeed,
if
one
looks
at
two
paragraphs
in
the
mccullough
opinion,
which,
to
my
knowledge,
is
still
the
law
of
this
land,
once
that
final
judgment
is
reached,
this
court
can't
look
behind
it
and
say,
well,
it
wasn't
a
really
good
final
judgment;
it
was
based
on
a
statute
of
limitations.
you...
you
should
have
filed
an
appeal,
you
shouldn't
have
filed...
have
filed
an
appeal.
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
done.
and--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--courts
can
do
it.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
under
those
circumstances,
it...
it
would
have
been
within
pacific
mutual's
rights...
and
i'm
not
saying
we
would
agree
to
it...
for
them
to
have
gone
the
60(b)
route
after
the
statute
came
in.
they
decided
not
to
do
that.
they
challenged
the
constitution...
i'm
sorry...
they...
they
challenged
our...
our
action,
and
here
we
are.
but
they
were
supposed
to
go
to
the
courts
under
60(b).
the
congress
does
not
have
that
authority.
can
you
imagine
if
the
congress
had
the
authority
that
is
given
to
the
courts
under
60(b)?
think
what
the
lobbyists
would
do
with
it.
i
mean--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--by
the
branch
of
the
government
that
rendered
the
judgment,
your
honor,
not
by
another
one.
not
by
the
congress.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
oh,
i
don't
believe
so
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
no,
no,
no.
no.
i'm
saying
that
if
you
give
60(b)
power
to
the
congress,
you...
you
have
turmoil.
they
were...
this
wasn't
a
60(b)...
a
60(b)
application
isn't
supposed
to
go
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
it
goes
to
the
courts.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
i...
i
would
suggest
to
you,
your
honor,
both
the
separation
of
powers
principles
and
due
process.
it
is
one
thing
to
allow
the
branch
of
the
government
that
entered
the
judgment
to
exercise
their
discretion
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
relief
should
be
granted.
it
is
an
entirely
different
thing
to
have
the
congress
come
in
and
do
it
without...
you
know,
mr.
justice
souter,
you...
justice
souter,
you
said
that
you
did
the
same
thing
as
the
congress...
you
don't
do
it
at
all.
you
have
different
rules
of
law.
you
have
different
standards
than
the
congress--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
right--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--i
really
don't
know
what
happens
if
congress
exercised
60(b);
i
really
hope
it
never
does.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
correct.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
but
isn't
that
something
that
the
courts
should
do,
rather
than
the
congress?
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
isn't
that
what
separation--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--i
agree.
that's
why
it
should
be
shot
down.
the--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--sioux
nation.
good.
the...
the...
you
are
gracious,
indeed,
your
honor.
the...
the
point...
the
point
about
sioux
nation
is
this,
that
in
the...
it
is,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
the
linchpin
of
the...
of
my
opponent's
argument,
that,
indeed,
one
can
have
sharing;
that
it's
okay
to
have
a
little
give
and
take,
and
it's
the
flexibility
doctrine
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
and,
indeed,
the
argument
is
made
that
in
this
court...
excuse
me,
in
the
sioux
nation
case,
this
court
affirmatively
rejected
a
separation
of
powers
argument.
indeed,
the
firth
circuit
opinion...
i
am
reading
now
from...
well,
it's
a-32
of
our
petition
for
a
writ,
but
it's
from
the
second-to-the-last
page
of
the
opinion...
the
fifth
circuit
stated
in
sioux
nation,
the
government
appealed,
asserting
that
the
statute...
which
took
away
the
res
judicata
defense...
the
government
appealed,
asserting
that
this
statute
violates
the
constitutional
separation
of
legislative
and
judicial
authority.
therefore,
the
fifth
circuit
says
this
question
was
explicitly
raised
and
fought
for
by
the
government
in
sioux
nation.
let's
go
to
the
record.
in
the
transcript
of
the
oral
argument
of
sioux
nation,
a
member
of
this
court
turned,
at
the
very
end
of
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
and
said,
doesn't
the
separation
of
powers,
doesn't
that
bother
you
at
all?
you
don't
make
the
argument.
is
that
conceivably
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine?
answer:
i
would
have
thought
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
hesitated
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question
on
another
subject.
i
think
congress
is
entitled
to
say,
you
may
have
another
opportunity
to
litigate
your
lawsuit.
as
a
result,
the
majority
opinion
in
this
court
stated
that
because
the
government
had
waived
this
very
point,
neither
of
the
two
separation
of
powers
objections
is
presented
by
this
legislation
and,
therefore,
to
this
court.
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
in
sioux
nation.
it
is
not
an
authority
for
my
adversaries.
indeed,
in
the
majority
opinion
in
sioux
nation,
specific
reference...
and
we
believe
approving
reference...
is
made
to
hayburn's
case,
as
stating
the
general
rule,
and
indeed,
in
the
chief
justice's
dissent,
i
think
he
certainly
reached
the
same
conclusion--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--i
know
this
isn't
done.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
mean,
on
what
grounds
would
the
court
be
fiddling
with
the...
the
statutory
language
of
the
claim?
i
don't
know
what
the
grounds
would
be--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--exactly.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
i
think
that's
probably
correct.
i
haven't...
i
haven't
really
traced
it
through.
anyway,
your
honor,
could...
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
your
honor,
i
will
be
very
brief.
number
one,
the
concept
that
this
statute
is
not
an
interference,
and
that
the
courts
can
do
whatever
they
want
when
they
get
back
is
belied
by
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
which
states
that
upon
such
a
motion...
excuse
me...
upon
such
a
showing,
the
case
shall...
shall...
be
reinstated
on
motion
by
the
plaintiff.
there
is
no
discretion
left
to
the
court.
the
congress
has
told
them
what
to
do.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
anybody
with
a
first
year
law
student's
education
knows
what
to
do
with
that
statute,
sir.
number
two,
hayburn's
case
is
supposedly
irrelevant
because
there
are
no
host
judgment
cases
around...
supposedly...
no
cases
where
the
judgment's
effect
has
been
taken
away,
or
no
executive
action.
i
would
ask
the
court,
in
your
leisure
time,
to
look
at
page
10
of
our
reply
brief,
where
we
have
cited
three
cases
from
this...
this
court,
including
the
o'grady
decision,
which
was
cited
by
chief
justice
rehnquist,
in...
in
sioux
nation,
as
well
as
two
others...
jefferson
and
waters,
as
well
as,
i
might
add,
your
honors,
many
cases
from
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
and
the
state
supreme
courts,
on
which
my
learned
adversaries
turn
a
nelsonian
eye.
there
is
not
a
word
addressed
to
a
single
one
of
those
decisions.
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
in...
in
essence,
your
honor,
even
though
the
claim
was
finally
dismissed
before
the
statute--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--that's
correct.
we
would
cleave
to
our
position,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers.
it
would
merely
be
an
evasion
of
the
doctrine
by
the
congress
simply
saying,
we
know
you
had
a
final
judgment
on
a
two-year
or
three-year
statute,
now
it's
four
years.
we--
mr.
james
w.
b.
benkard
--that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr....
justice
kennedy,
to...
to
respond
to
your
question
as
to
what
is
the...
in
the
so-called
flexibility
cases,
what...
how
far
can
you
go
before
interfering
with
the
courts
too
much?
from
the
nixon
decision
at
least,
the
phrase
"potential
disruption"
is
used.
and
if
this
isn't...
in
other
words,
if
there
is
a
potential
disruption
when
branch
a
takes
something
from
branch
b,
then
that
does
not
pass
muster.
i...
i
commend
to
your
honors
that
nothing
could
be
more
disruptive
than
the
ability
of
the
other
branch
to
take
from
you
perhaps
your
most
precious
attribute...
and
that
is
to
terminate
cases.
and
those
cases
are
entitled
to
just
as
much
due
process
protection.
the
mccullough
case
lives.
it
is
just
as
valid
as
it
was
when
it
was
decided
in
1898,
and
it's
cited
every
day...
not
every
day...
it
is
cited
constantly
by
courts.
your
honors,
we
submit
that
indeed...
justice
souter,
the
two
doctrines
do
merge,
although
i
think
separation
of
powers
is
there.
and
it
actually,
in
essence,
it
is
the
reason
we
have
a
due
process
right,
as
well.
and
for
that
reason
it
is
our
submission
that
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit
poses
the
gravest
possible
threat
to
this
judicial
system
and
to
the
persons
who
rely
upon
it
every
day.
therefore,
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
be
reversed.
