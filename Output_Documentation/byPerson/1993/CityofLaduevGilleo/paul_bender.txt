mr.
paul
bender
right,
it
is
different,
and
perhaps
i
should
start
there.
mr.
paul
bender
the
difference
is
that
highway
beautification
act...
there's
several
differences.
i
think
that
the
main
one
is
that
the
highway
beautification
act
does
not
constitute
a
complete
ban
on
this
medium
of
expression
in
a
community.
the
highway
beautification
act
only
applies
within
a
narrow
strip
of
land
adjacent
to
interstate
highways.
even
then,
it--
mr.
paul
bender
--certainly--
mr.
paul
bender
--right--
mr.
paul
bender
--it
might,
but
the
highway
beautification
act
does
not
deprive
them
of
that
only
opportunity
to
put
up
a
political
sign.
they
can
put
up
the
sign
in
a
way
that
faces
away
from
the
highway,
probably
the
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
highway.
very
few...
very
few
houses
have
their
driveways
off
a
major
interstate
highway.
mr.
paul
bender
where
no
one
can
see
it,
right.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
no,
i
think
that--
[laughter]
--i
think
there's
an
important
point
there.
people
like
mrs.
gilleo
who
put
up
signs
are
not
trying
to
communicate
with
people
passing
by
on
an
interstate
highway.
they're
primarily
trying
to
communicate
with
their
neighbors.
the
highway
beautification
act
is
a
very
small
interference,
if
any,
with
people's
ability
to
communicate
with
their
neighbors.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
fact
that
there
are
all
those
cars,
i'm
talking
about
the
purpose
of
the
expression
here,
and
i
think
it's
very
important.
the
purpose
of
the
expression,
i
think,
is
for
her
to
communicate
an
adherence
to
a
principle
to
the
people
in
her
community.
that
is,
i
think,
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--that
is
a
different
kind
of
interest
that
somebody
might
also
have.
the
difference
there
is
that...
and
i
think
this
is
the
central
factor
that
one
needs
to
look
at
in
analyzing
this
case,
is
that
with
the
highway
beautification
act
there
is
a
strong
reason
for
prohibiting
that
kind
of
a
sign,
because
if
you
had
every
house
that
an
interstate
highway
went
by
with
a
sign
like
that
it
really
would
be
cluttered.
the
only
reason
that
the
city
of
ladue
gives
here
in
either
the
ordinance
or
their
brief
for
prohibiting
this
sign
is
that
the
proliferation
of
an
unlimited
number
of
signs
in
the
community
is
an
evil.
they
do
not
say,
i
don't
think
they
mean,
and
i
don't
think
they
could
possibly
say
that
single
signs,
or
very
small
numbers
of
signs,
are
a
problem.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
you
have
to
look
first
at
the
reason
why
the
governmental
unit
is
trying
to
impose
the
regulation.
in
the
case
of
the
highway
beautification
act,
i
think
it's
a
feeling
that
insofar
as
possible,
when
people
drive
down
highways
they
should
see
the
scenery
and
shouldn't
see
signs.
ladue
has
not
said
that
it's...
when
people
look
out
of
their
window
they
shouldn't
see
a
sign.
what
ladue
is
worried
about
is
the
unlimited
proliferation
of
signs,
and
i
think
what
they've
done
wrong
here
is
that
to
assert
the
interest
in
unlimited
proliferation
they
have
just
stopped
all
signs
altogether.
at
the
very
least,
i
think
they
should
be
required
to
try
a
more
modest
kind
of
regulation.
if
in
fact
that
doesn't
work,
if
in
fact
there
is
a
problem,
then
perhaps
sometime
they
might
be
able
to
do
this,
but
without
any
showing
that
there
is
a
problem
of
unlimited
proliferation
in
this
community,
to
ban
all
signs
in
the
name
of
stopping
unlimited
proliferation
seems
to
me
irrational.
mr.
paul
bender
even
if
you
talk
about
real
proliferation,
ladue
says
there
might
be
as
many
as
3,000
signs
in
the
community
if
everyone
had
one
sign...
for
example,
if
there
were
a
one-sign
limit.
there
almost
6,000
acres
in
this
community.
that
would
be
one
sign
for
every
2
acres.
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
you
can
relate
to
it,
and
of
course--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
there's
not
a
one
sign
limit
for
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--but
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
you
can't
just
look
at
that,
you've
got
to
look
at
the
impact
on
the
community,
and
i
think
it's
extremely
important
that
the
highway
beautification
act
does
not
shut
off
a
means
of
communication
within
an
entire
community.
mr.
paul
bender
that
may
be
your
concern,
but
the
federal
government's
concern
is
with
what
you
see
when
you
drive
by
on
interstate--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it's
not
only
that
there's
less
of
an
interest,
first
of
all
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
city
says,
and
the
city
talks
about
an
unlimited
proliferation.
i
think
you
have
to
take
them
at
their
word.
they
wrote
this
preamble,
and
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
paul
bender
but
i
think
you
also
have
to
look
at
the
impact
of
the
regulation
on
the
people
who
are
being
regulated.
ladue
is
shutting
off
people
from
a
traditional
means
of
communication.
i
think
it's
important...
and
this
is
a
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
earlier.
yes,
i
think
there
is
a
separate
character
of
somebody
putting
up
a
sign
or
a
flag
at
their
house.
i
think
that's
why
people
fly
flags
from
their
house.
mr.
paul
bender
when
those
interests
come
into
collision
in
that
way,
i
think
you
have
to
give
the
decision
to
the
governmental
interest
if
it's
reasonable,
but
there
is
a
situation,
if
the
only
place
the
homeowner
can
put
a
sign
is
facing
on
the
highway,
then
there
the
federal
interest
in
keeping
the
highways
beautiful
i
think
overwhelms
that.
but
here,
the...
because
the
federal
government
has
an
interest,
based
on
past
history
of
unlimited
proliferation
of
signs
along
highways.
but
here
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
history,
and
you
don't
even
have
the
community
saying
that
that's
the
problem
they're
worried
about.
mr.
paul
bender
exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
it
is
hereby
declared
that
the
proliferation
of
an
unlimited
number
of
signs...
sorry.
it's
the
proliferation
of
an
unlimited
number,
rather
than
an
unlimited
proliferation.
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
think
about
the
communicative...
the
special
communicative
quality
of
a
sign
at
one's
home.
it's
not,
justice
o'connor,
like
putting
a
sign
in
a
downtown
place.
if
you
want
to
fly
a
flag
from
your
house...
i
remember
when
i
walked
to
school
during
the
second
world
war
going
past
houses
that
had
signs
indicating
that
people
from
that
house,
children
and
fathers,
were
in
the
service.
there's
some
special
quality
of
doing
that.
when
people
put
yellow
ribbons
around
trees
in
front
of
their
house
to
express
support
for
the
return
of
the
hostages,
that's
nothing
that
you
can--
mr.
paul
bender
--you
can't
do
it
on
a
federal
highway,
i
suppose,
that
would
be
dangerous,
but
you
could
also
do
it--
[laughter]
mr.
paul
bender
the
highway
beautification
act
i
don't
think
affects
yellow
ribbons,
and
also,
another
point
about
the
highway
beautification
act,
you've
got
to
worry
about
the
scale.
the
highway
beautification
act
does
not
deal
with
signs
that
can't
be
read,
seen
from
the
road.
normally,
unless
the
house
is
right
next
to
the
road,
and
then
i
don't
know
how
you're
going
to
communicate
with
your
neighbors,
a
small
sign
like
the
sign
in
this
case
would
not
violate
the
highway
beautification
act.
if
the
house
were,
say,
100
feet
from
the
road,
it
would
not
be
considered
a
sign
because
it's
not
visible.
the
highway
beautification
act
is
dealing
with
large-scale
billboards.
mr.
paul
bender
except
that
with
the
highway
beautification
act,
that
limitation
means
that
people
can
preserve
the
right
to
communicate
with
their
neighbors
who
might
walk
in
front
of
the
house,
between
the
highway
and
the
house
and
see
the
sign,
without
injuring
the
federal
interest
of
cluttering
up
the
landscape
for
people
driving
by.
this
prevents
people
from
using
that
traditional
means
of
expression
to
communicate
with
their
neighbors
entirely,
and
there's
no
basis
that
we
know
of
for
doing
that.
there's
never
been
a
clutter
problem
in
ladue.
there
is
no
indication--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
chance
that
the
evil
will
materialize,
and
i
don't
think
this
record
shows
any
substantiality
of
that
chance.
