mr.
cherrick,
your
ordinance
has
some
exemptions.
not
all
signs
are
banned.
there's
a
list
of
exemptions,
and
those
exemptions
would
appear
to
be
content-based
as
we
have
used
that
term
in
prior
cases
and,
under
our
existing
doctrine,
how
can
you
defend
those
content-based
exceptions
or
exemptions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
have
exemptions
for
sale
or
for
lease
signs,
which
certainly
aren't
safety-related,
and
for
church
signs
and
so
forth,
so
surely
some
of
those
are
content-based?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
we
have
to
apply
our
usual
strict
scrutiny
test
here,
and
under
that
test,
do
you
think
that
the
exemptions
survive
strict
scrutiny,
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest,
that
there's
no
other
alternative
that
would
be
less
burdensome,
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
did
say...
i
thought
your
opposing
counsel
acknowledged
this
morning
that
it
would
have
been
all
right
to
put
the
sign
in
her
car
window
and
park
it
in
the
driveway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
greiman,
would
it
be
a
reasonable
alternative
if
at
some
public
and
prominent
site
within
the
community...
for
instance,
city
hall...
there
were
a
space
or
a
big
bulletin
board
allowed
where
the
homeowners
could
place
signs
of
any
type,
and
could
identify
themselves
as
being
homeowners
within
the
city,
so
that
everyone
who
saw
it
would
know,
this
is
the
expression
of
the
view
of
the
homeowner
who
put
it
up?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
is
that
if
the
sign
itself
allows
you
to
identify
yourself
as
a
homeowner
in
the
community?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
just
to
be
sure
of
where
your
position
takes
you,
i
would
assume
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
federal
highway
beautification
act
is
similarly
invalid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
narrow
strip
might
consist
of
somebody's
home.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
their
only
home.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
their
only
opportunity
to
put
up
a
political
sign.
