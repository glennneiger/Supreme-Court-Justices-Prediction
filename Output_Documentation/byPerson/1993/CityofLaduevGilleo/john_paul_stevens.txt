paul
stevens
don't
you
have
a
handbill
ordinance?
do
you
allow
handbills
all
over
the
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do?
you
allow
handbills
to
be
distributed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
very...
very
fine
neighborhood
to
have
handbills
scattered
all
over
the
place.
you
have
to
wear
colonial
costumes
when
you
hand
them
out.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
confirm
one
thing
i
really
want
to
be
sure
about?
do
you
actually
prohibit,
during
election
campaigns,
"vote
for
ike"
in
the
window,
or
"vote
for
adlai",
or
something
like
that?
that's
not
even
permitted
in
an
election
campaign?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
ordinance
completely
enforced
and
obeyed,
that
they've
never
even
put
election
signs
up
in
the
windows?
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
there's
complete
compliance
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
your
view
i
suppose
they
could
have
prohibited
flags.
if
a
different
community
thought
flags
were
just
as
obnoxious
as
these
window
signs,
i
suppose
it
could
prohibit
the
flags
too,
couldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
their
judgment.
i
suppose
you've
always
prohibited
them.
you
don't
really
know
how
bad
the
problem
would
be
if
you
didn't
have
this
ordinance,
do
you?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
ever
since
1935
you've
said
no
"i
like
ike"
signs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
you
say
there
is
a
prolifer...
not
in
ladue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
weren't
planned
by
this
same
architectural
expert,
were
they?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
the
homes
in
those
neighboring
cities
sell
for
anything
like
the
price
that
you
get
in
ladue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
to
protect
values.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
incidentally,
what
if
you
parked
your
car
in
your
driveway
and
had
a
sign
in
the
window
of
the
car,
and
you
just
left
it
there.
would
that
violate
the
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
child's
wagon
sitting
out
there,
and
put
the
sign
on
the
wagon?
i
suppose
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me...
it's
not
a
very
important
question...
do
they
prohibit
"keep
off
the
grass"
signs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
"keep
off
the
grass"
is
a
directional
sign?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
"beware
of
the
dog".
[laughter]
"beware
of
the
dog",
similarly.
you
can
have
that
sign.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
like
saying
she
can
put
a
sign
in
the
backyard.
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know--
[laughter]
--i
mean,
if
you
say
you
can
put
a
sign
on
i-95,
but
you've
got
to
face
away
from
the
highway,
that's
not--
--facing
the
back
40.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
just
saying
though,
that
the
audience
on
i-95
is
bigger
than
the
audience
that
passes
through
ladue.
that
doesn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
why
is
that
different
than
the
purpose
to
communicate
your
opposition
to
drunk
driving,
and
you
want
the
people
who
are
driving
cars
to
be
particularly
aware
of
that
communication?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
two
opinions
that
i
have
to
announce
are
both
unanimous.
the
first,
city
of
ladue
against
margaret
gilleo,
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
a
city
ordinance
that
prohibits
home
owners
from
displaying
any
signs
on
their
property
except
resident's
identification
signs
or
sale
signs,
and
signs
warning
of
safety
hazard.
respondent,
the
owner
of
a
single
family
dwelling
in
ladue
which
is
a
suburb
of
st.
louis,
put
an
8.5x11
inch
sign
in
the
second
story
window
of
her
home
stating
that
she
was
"for
peace
in
the
gulf".
because
that
sign
violated
the
city's
ordinance,
she
had
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
court
seeking
to
enjoin
its
enforcement.
the
district
court
held
the
ordinance
invalid
as
a
content-based
regulation
because
the
city
treated
commercial
speech
more
favorably
than
non-commercial
speech
and
favored
some
kinds
of
non-commercial
speech
over
others.
thus,
for
example,
if
permitted
a
"for
sale"
sign
while
it
prohibited
respondent
sign
with
a
political
message.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
an
ordinance
of
this
kind
is
subject
to
constitutional
attack
on
alternative
grounds.
on
the
one
hand,
it
may
in
effect,
restrict
too
little
speech
because
its
exemptions
discriminate
on
the
basis
on
the
sign's
messages.
alternatively,
the
ordinance
may
be
subject
to
attack
on
the
ground
that
it
simply
prohibits
too
much
speech.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
former
ground.
but,
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
place
our
decision
on
the
latter
ground.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
although
on
different
reasoning
than
that
court
adapted.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
