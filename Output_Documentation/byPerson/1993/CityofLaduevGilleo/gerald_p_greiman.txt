mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
a
small
sign
displayed
by
a
citizen
at
her
own
home
to
communicate
her
views
on
an
important
public
issue
to
her
fellow
citizens.
if
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
the
kind
of
speech
at
issue
in
this
case,
it's
hard
to
imagine
what
it
does
protect.
certainly,
cities
like
ladue
may
adopt
reasonable
sign
regulations
addressing
size,
number,
and
other
aspects
of
time,
place,
and
manner,
but
ladue
may
not
virtually
ban
small
signs
as
a
mode
of
expression
within
its
borders.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
justice
scalia,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
no
time,
no
place,
and
no
manner
does
not
mean
a
regulation
of
time,
place,
and
manner.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
this
court
has
said
that
distinct
modes
of
expression
must
be
judged
by
their
own
rule.
we
believe
that
a
small
sign
at
one's
own
house
in
a
fixed
location
is
a
distinct
mode
of
expression.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
time,
place,
and
manner
would
apply
if
this
was--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--your
honor--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--your
honor,
ladue
does
not
allow
ms.
gilleo
to
maintain
this
sign
anywhere
else.
we
believe
that
being
able
to
speak
at
one's
house
is
a
very
important
feature,
that
there
are
property
rights
involved
in
this
case,
the
right
to
do
what
one
will--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--your
honor,
i
heard
mr.
cherrick
say
that,
although
the
record
in
this
case
showed
that
ladue
has
enforced
its
ordinance
in
a
number
of
instances
against
cars
parked
in
driveways
or
in
front
of
houses
with
for
sale
signs
on
them,
so
i'm
not
sure
that
interpretation
is
valid.
even
assuming
that
it
is,
a
small
sign
on
a
car
is
a
different
mode
of
expression.
a
sign
on
a
car
typically
communicates
when
a
car
is
moving.
a
sign
posted
in
a
fixed
position
at
a
house
has
a
very
special
communicative
impact.
it
conveys
not
only
the
message
contained
in
the
sign,
but
the
fact
that
a
resident
at
that
house
believes
in
that
message.
it
therefore
has
special
impact
upon
people
who
know
the
speaker,
or
know--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--justice
scalia,
sleeping
in
the
park
may
be
regulated
because
that
involves
conduct
mixed
with
speech.
here
we
are
talking
about
virtually
pure
speech,
and
we
believe
the
state
simply
may
not
restrict
that
in
the
manner
that
ladue
has
tried
to
do.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
chief
justice
rehnquist,
certainly
the
state
may
reasonably
limit
the
number
of
signs.
we
don't
believe
that
one
per
household,
especially
in
the
context
of
a
political
season,
would
be
reasonable,
but
certainly
they
can
adopt
reasonable
numerical
limitations.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
i
don't
have
a
specific
number,
your
honor.
it
has
to
allow
reasonable
opportunities
for
expression.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
perhaps,
your
honor.
perhaps
it
would
depend
upon
what
time
of
year
we're
talking
about.
perhaps
the
number
would
need
to
be
expanded
during
political
seasons.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
we
believe
the
city
may
properly
regulate
size,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
well,
justice
kennedy,
we
don't
believe
that
if
you
adopted
an
expanded
number
during
a
political
season
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
limit
that
expanded
number
only
to
political
campaign
signs.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
well,
we're
talking--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--we're
talking
about
time,
your
honor,
and
so
long
as
we're
talking
about
time,
and
we're
doing
it
in
a
content
neutral
way,
and
we're
allowing
reasonable
opportunities
for
expression,
i
believe
that's
okay.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
well,
the
regulation
in
terms
of
its
effects
is
not
content-based
because
it
allows
an
expanded
number
of
signs--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--well,
your
honor,
if
one
has
a
purpose
to
allow
speech
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
and
one
goes
about
implementing
that
in
a
content-neutral
way
to
allow
all
speech
along
with
the
particular
type
of
political
speech
that
you
have
most
in
mind,
i
believe
that's
okay.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
i
don't
believe
it
does,
justice
souter.
i
believe
the
test
for
whether
there
are
ample
alternative
channels
of
communication
is
whether
there
are
alternative
channels
of
the
same
nature
and
quality.
if
the
test
was
simply,
is
there
any
other
way
you
can
express
your
message,
then
certainly
the
linmark
case
would
have
been
decided
differently,
or
a
city
could
say,
we
can
ban
newspapers
altogether,
because
you
can
get
your
news
from
television,
or
we
can
ban
movies
on
grounds
that
there
are
books.
we
have
to
look
at
the
nature
and
quality
of
communicating
via
small
signs.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
well,
alternatives
have
to
include
something
that
is
of
the
same
nature
and
quality,
and
we
believe--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--in
the
context
of
a
resident
speaking
at
her
own
home,
we
maintain
nothing.
we
believe
that
there
are
very
important
and
unique
attributes
to
speaking
through
a
small
sign
at
one's
home
that
aren't
duplicated
by
other
modes.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
that's
part
of
our
position,
your
honor,
but
here
we're
talking
about
a
particular
mode
of
expression,
and
we're
talking
about
whether
there's
some
alternative
to
that
mode
of
expression
that
is
of
equal--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
that's
correct,
and
the
reason
is
that
speaking
from
one's
own
property
has
special
communicative
impact.
it
conveys
not
only
the
message
on
the
sign,
but
that
a
resident
at
that
site
believes
in
that
message.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
i
believe
the
linmark
case
would
be
the
best
authority,
justice
kennedy.
certainly
there
are
other
ways
to
sell
one's
house...
via
newspaper--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--well,
we
believe
we're
talking
about
the
same
thing
here,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
absolutely.
we
have
a
resident
who
holds
deeply
seated
views
on
a
very
important
public
issue
and
wants
to
communicate
those
views
to
neighbors
and
other
residents.
the
house
is
a
uniquely
effective
place
for
doing
that.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
well,
your
honor,
that
is
a
commercial
undertaking,
and
i
believe
that
via
zoning
laws,
cities
may
regulate
commercial
activity.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
well,
perhaps.
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
a
sign
regulation
it
is
adopting.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
commercial
signs
it
has
greater
ability
to
regulate,
your
honor,
because
there
are
other
alternatives
for
engaging
in
commercial
speech.
again,
it
depends
on
what
distinctions
the
city
is
drawing.
it
may
have
greater
ability
to
regulate
in
that
area,
but
it
has
no
greater
ability
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
content.
i
believe
this
court
made
that
clear
in
discovery
network.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
you
may
not
ban
that,
and
certainly
again--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--not
quite,
justice
scalia.
you
can
impose
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations
relating
to
private
property
as
well,
but
they
have
to
be
time,
place,
and
manner,
not
total
bans.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
chief
justice
rehnquist,
they
may
regulate
that
aspect,
because
once
you
get
into
bullhorns,
you're
getting
into
the
ward
type
situation,
you're
getting
into
the
kovacs
sound
type
situation,
and
you
are
talking
about
regulating
volume
now.
you're
talking
about
regulating
non--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
ms.
gilleo's
sign
stands
silently
on
her
own
property.
you
don't
see
it
unless
you
choose
to
look.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
it
is
visually
silent,
justice
scalia,
unless
you
choose
to
look
over
on
ms.
gilleo's
property.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
well,
justice
souter,
i
believe
i
said
that
they
may
regulate
volume,
they
may
impose
other
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
i
don't
believe
that
the
city
of
ladue
may
ban
that
mode
of
expression
entirely.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
if
you
accept
that
they
can
ban
what
they
ban
here,
i
believe
the
implication
of
that
position
is
yes,
they
can
ban
her
from
standing
on
a
soapbox
at
her
property.
i
believe
the
implication
is
that
they
could
ban
private
conversation
on
the
sidewalks
on
the
notion
that
that
interferes
with
the
ability
to
hear
birds
chirping.
or
i
believe
that
they
could
ban
gatherings
on
public
sidewalks
on
the
notion
that
clumps
of
people
impair
the
visual
beauty
of
the
natural
landscape.
that
certainly
cannot
be
the
law,
and
is
not
the
law.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
justice
souter,
on
the
continuum
of
nonpublic
forum,
limited
public
forum,
we
believe
that
ms.
gilleo's
private
home
here
has
to
be
viewed
as
either
the
equivalent
of
a
public
forum
for
protected
purposes,
or
even
stronger,
because
again
we're
talking
about
a
citizen's
right
to
speak
from
her
own
home,
as
the
court
recognized
had
special
significance
in
the
vincent
case,
the
court
recognized
that
in
spence,
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
a
number
of
other
cases.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
they
don't,
your
honor.
they
allow
directional
signs.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
they've
made
clear
that
"no
trespassing"
signs
are
allowed.
you
may
have
those
in
any
number,
and
they
may
be
up
to
12
square
feet
in
size.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
"beware
of
dog"
is
also
permitted
in
any
size,
and
in
any
number.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor,
for
this
reason.
by
speaking
in
that
manner
rather
than
at
your
own
home,
you
lose
the
special
communicative
impact
that
you
gain
from
your
own
home.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
well,
for
example,
a
"tax
the
rich"
sign
posted
in
front
of
an
affluent
home
carries
a
different
communicative
impact
than
would
the
exact
same
sign
displayed
in
a
less
affluent
area.
i
believe
that
you
lose
those
communicative
impacts
by
relegating
everyone
to
a
single
space.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
well,
justice
scalia,
that
gets
into
arbitrariness,
and
perhaps
viewpoint
discrimination.
american
flags
are
readily
and
easily
available--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--that
suggests
that
if
one
wants
to
display
an
american
flag
at
one's
home,
one
can
very
easily
go
down
to
the
corner
store,
buy
one,
and
put
it
up,
but
if
you
want
to
display
a
custom-made
flag
message
you
have
to
go
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble,
perhaps,
or
a
great
deal
of
expense
to
have
your
own
sign
custom-made.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
that
may
be
more
difficult,
your
honor--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--well,
ms.
gilleo
didn't
have
to
make
her
own
signs.
they
were
being
distributed
by
groups.
she
could--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--they
may
make
them,
but
they
don't
make
them,
and
if
one
has
to
custom-make--
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
--perhaps,
and
it
hasn't
been
clear
to
me
through
the
city's
position
in
this
case
whether
they
concede
that
you
can
make
your
own
sign
out
of
a
bed
sheet,
for
example.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
if
it
is
true,
then
that
confirms
the
arbitrariness
and
the
content-discriminatory
nature
of
the
ordinance,
and
the
lack
of
validity
to
their
asserted
reasons,
because
certainly
a
homemade
sign
on
a
bed
sheet
has
no
lesser
impact
on
so-called
visual
blight
than
does
a
small,
8-1/2
x
11
inch
sign
posted
inside
a
window
of
somebody's
home.
perhaps
the
major
flaw
in
ladue's
position
throughout
this
case
is
that
it
largely
ignores
the
existence
of
the
first
amendment.
ladue
goes
on
at
length
on
principles
of
zoning
law
and
land-use
law,
but
it
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
first
amendment
imposes
constraints.
mr.
gerald
p.
greiman
we
do
not
say
that
at
all,
justice
o'connor.
we
believe
the
highway
beautification
act
imposes
a
very
different
regulatory
scheme
than
ladue's
ordinance.
thank
you.
