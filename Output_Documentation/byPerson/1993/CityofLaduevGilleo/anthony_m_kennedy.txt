justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
you
cannot
draft
an
adequate
time,
place,
and
manner
ordinance
that
would
allow
some
signs
of
this
character?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
ward
a
time,
place,
and
manner
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
a
time,
place,
and
manner
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
expand
according
to
the
political
season,
that's
content-based,
isn't
it?
some
people
are
much
more
interested
in
sports
than
politics.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
but
your
reason
is
to
accommodate
politics.
you're
saying
that
you
don't
have
to
give
the
real
reason
for
what
your
ordinance
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
kind
of
tricky,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
the
purpose
for
your
expanding
the
number
of
signs
in
this
hypothetical
ordinance
during
the
political
season
was
to
accommodate
political
speech.
i
mean,
what
other
reason
would
you
have
for
doing
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
ask
why
isn't
that
content-based?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
purpose
of
your
statute
is
content-based.
that's
the
underlying
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
your
best
authority
for
that?
if
we
accepted
that
proposition,
what
case
would
we
cite
to
support
that...
adderly
v.
florida,
the
jail
case,
went
the
other
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems
to
me...
because
that
has
just
a
common
sense
functional
aspect
to
it.
if
you're
going
to
sell
the
house
you
should
put
a
sign
on
the
house
that
this
is
the
house.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
woman
is
an
extension
of
her
house?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
just
want
to
make
one
thing
clear.
do
you
agree
that
there
is
no
ordinance
which
prohibits
leaflets
and
pamphlets?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
argument.
i
thought
that
you
began
with
the
premise
that
the
highway
beautification
act
is
sustainable
because
there
will
be...
there
is
a
real
danger
of
proliferation,
and
then
you
say,
and
the
only
thing
that
ladue
says
to
justify
its
ordinance
is
proliferation.
i
see
there
a
parallel
between
the
two
and
not
a
distinction
between
the
two.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
you
say
your
concern,
mr.
bender.
what
we're
asking
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
plausible,
reasonable
basis
for
the
city's
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
that
there's
less
of
an
interest
in
a
city,
in
a
neighborhood,
to
prevent
signs
than
on
a
highway.
that
just
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
that's
odd,
because
it
means
that
if
everybody's
very
interested
in
this
speech,
then
all
of
a
sudden
we
can
suppress
it,
so
i
have
problems
with
that
rationale
as
well.
