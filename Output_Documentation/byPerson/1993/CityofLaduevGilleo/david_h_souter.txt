justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
excuse
me.
no,
please
answer
his
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
also
interpreting
time,
place,
and
manner
as
i
understand
it
to
authorize
you
to
make
a
complete
prohibition
of,
i
gather,
all
signs,
if
you
wanted
to
go
that
far,
is
that
correct?
i
understood
you
to
be
alluding
to
vincent
a
moment
ago
as
authority
for
the
proposition
that
you
could
have
gone
further
than
you
did,
is
that
correct?
is
that
your
position,
and
do
you
so
read
vincent?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
have...
in
your
view,
would
vincent
have
authorized
the
town
to
prohibit
not
only
the
signs
prohibited
here,
but
also
the...
at
least
the
private
signs
allowed
here,
commercial
signs
in
front
of
stores,
for
sale
signs,
identification
signs...
could
you
have
gone
the
whole
hog,
as
you
read
vincent?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about...
what
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
also
your
view
on
the
religious
sign
that
the
red
brief
referred
to?
the
red
brief
took
the
position
that
under
the
ordinance
a
church
would
be
allowed
to
display
a
sign
saying,
"say
no
to
abortion".
is
that
your
view
that
it
would,
and
is
the
reasoning
for
allowing
it
what
you've
just
stated?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
is
it
your
position
that
all
of
the
exceptions
here
which
create
what
some
members
of
the
court
have
described
as
content-based
problems
for
you
are
required
by
decisions
of
this
court,
so
that
all
of
the
exceptions
are
necessities,
constitutional
necessities,
is
that
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
we
were
to
take
the
position
that
you
are
not
constitutionally
required
to
allow
square
or
rectangular
flags
displaying
this
particular
message,
and...
would
that
then
knock
out
your
theory
of
content-based
justification?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
you're
going
to
a
different
rationale,
then.
you're
saying
there
are
two
rationales.
one
is,
some
of
these
exceptions
are
required
by
the
court.
the
other
one
is,
some
of
these
exceptions
do
not
present
risks
of
blight.
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they
can
be
identified
without
any
content
base.
justice
david
h.
souter
one
of
your
arguments
was
that
you
didn't
have...
or
that
the
people
of
this
town
didn't
have
reasonable
alternatives.
counsel
on
the
other
side
has
conceded
or
represented
this
morning
that
they
can
scatter
leaflets
at
will.
doesn't
that
take
care
of
your
reasonable
alternative?
leaflets
are
cheap.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
alternative
has
got
to
include
a
sign
alternative
then,
in
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
else
is
of
the
nature
and
quality
of
a
sign
except
a
sign?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
in
fact
it's
not
so
much
the
sign
that
you're
relying
on,
it's
the
capacity
to
speak
from
one's
own
property,
isn't
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
as
i
understand
what
you
were
just
saying,
if
the
city
said,
we're
going
to
set
aside
two
acres
on
one
of
the
downtown
streets,
and
anyone
can
put
up
a
sign
down
there,
this
particular
woman
can
go
down
and
put
up
a
sign
about
the
gulf
war,
you
would
not
find
that
an
adequate
alternative,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
reason
you
wouldn't
is
that
you
believe
the
speech
has
got
to
be
allowed
from
one's
own
property.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
take
the
position
that
if
the
city
can
prohibit
the
signs
in
the
manner
in
which
it's
trying
to
do
here,
you
can
equally,
or
could
equally
well
prohibit
the
person
from
standing
on
the
soapbox
and
speaking
in
a
manner
that
could
be
heard
next
door.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we're
not
talking
about
the
bullhorn,
or
let's
say
just
in
a
manner
that
could
be
heard
on
the
street.
if
the
city
can
do
this,
can
the
city
prevent
the
person
from
standing
on
the
soapbox
and
speaking
in
a
way
that
could
be
heard
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
street
because
the
people
in
the
town
don't
want
audio
clutter?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
if
they
can
ban
what
they're
purporting
to
ban
here,
can
they
ban
that
as
well?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
the
problem
there
is
you'd
suddenly
find
yourself
in
the
public
forum
doctrine,
and
the
city's
claim
here
is
there's
no
public
forum.
they're
simply
using
private
property
to
create
clutter.
so
i
think
your
argument's
got
to
be
that
they
couldn't
use
private...
that
if
the
city
is
right,
then
by
the
same
token
the
city
could
ban
using
private
property
as
a
source
for
the
speaking
that
could
be
heard
out
on
the
street.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
you've
got
to
do
is
get
a
piece
of
cloth
and
some
paint.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
more
difficult
than
making
a
sign?
you've
got
to
get
a
piece
of
cardboard
and
some
paint.
justice
david
h.
souter
sign-makers
and
flag-makers
can
make
them
equally
easily,
can't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
don't
because
the
word
hasn't
gotten
out,
but
i
mean
the
flag
business
is--
[laughter]
i
don't
think
a
lot
of
people
have
known
that
the
city
has
been
interpreting
its
ordinance
this
way,
but
now
that
the
word
is
out,
the
flag-makers
will
have
a--
--boom
business.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it's
true,
what
about
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question?
why
isn't
simply
a
manner
restriction?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
real
justification--
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
that
mean
that
your
argument
is
good
with
respect
to
billboard
companies
that
in
fact
can
put
billboards
up
in
other
places
than
along
the
highway
but
not
good
and
not
a
sufficient
justification
with
respect
to
the
homeowner
whose
backyard
backs
up
to
the
highway
and
doesn't
have
another
place
to
put
up
a
sign?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
in
effect
you're
saying
the
justification
falls
in
the
city's
case
and
it
doesn't
fall--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
the
government's
case.
