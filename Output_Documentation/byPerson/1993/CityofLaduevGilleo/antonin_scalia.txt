justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
you
think,
mr.
cherrick,
also,
that
one
of
the
other
reasons
why
you
don't
think
it
would
be
satisfactory
simply
to
say
everybody
can
have
one
sign
of
any
sort
is,
you
think
that
would
be
too
many
signs.
you
don't
want
a
sign
up
in
every
house
in
this
neighborhood,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
one.
now,
theoretically
that
could
happen
under
your
scheme,
but
it's
not
likely
to
happen.
it's
not
likely
to
happen.
every
house
in
the
neighborhood's
not
going
to
be
up
for
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
consider
that
a
visual
blight
to
have
a
sign
up
in
every
house...
you
walk
down
the
street,
every
house
has
a
sign,
vote
for
him,
vote
for
the
other.
you
don't
want
that,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
that
rectangular
flags
can
say
anything
at
all?
rectangular
flags
can
say
"vote
for
ike",
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
how
you
interpret
the
exception
for
flags
which
is
contained
in
the
ordinance.
you
say
that
means
so
long
as
it's
a
rectangular
banner,
you
can
put
anything
on
that
banner
you
want.
the
message
involved
here
could
have
been
flown
on
a
flag,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
a
pennant.
not
a
pennant?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
pretty
stupid
judgment.
i
don't
understand
any
sense
behind
that
at
all.
that's
totally
irrational,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
irrational?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
tell
me
why...
why
triangles
are
worse
than
rectangles.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
if
you're
talking
about
patriotic
flags,
you
know,
on
holidays
and
things
like
that,
i
can
understand
it,
but
you
haven't
interpreted
the
thing
that
way.
you've
interpreted
it
to
say,
you
can
put
anything
on
your
house
you
want,
so
long
as
you
put
it
on
a
rectangular
piece
of
cloth,
but
not
if
you
put
it
on
a
triangular
piece
of
cloth,
or
a
bunting.
bunting
is
no
good
either,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
really
think
that's
what
they
meant
when
they
made
the
exception
for
flags,
i
really
don't.
i
think
they
probably
meant
by
a
flag,
a
flag.
you
know,
as
in
follow
the
flag.
i
love
the
flag.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
hasn't
done
that.
this
is...
i
mean,
if
you
say
that
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction
is
okay,
why
is
this
not
a
place
restriction?
she
can
have
this
sign
anywhere
she
wants.
she
just
can't
put
it
on
her
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
isn't
no
time,
no
place,
and
no
manner.
it's
just
on
her
house.
she
can
put
it
on
her
car.
she
can
walk
in
front
of
the
house
holding
a
sign.
that's
not
no
place.
justice
antonin
scalia
time,
place,
and
manner
doesn't
apply
to
this
case,
then,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does.
but
then
why
isn't
it
perfectly
reasonable
to
say
the
only
place
she
can't
do
this
is
by
putting
a
sign
on
her
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you're
enlisting
support
from
a
feeling
that,
you
know,
a
woman's
home
is
her
castle,
and
she
should
be
able
to
do
whatever
she
wants
with
it,
but
she
can.
i
mean,
she
can't...
she
probably
cannot
paint
her
house
puce
in
this
community,
i
would
suppose.
that's
perfectly
okay,
but
for
some
reason
we
must
allow
her
to
put
a
sign
in
her
house.
whatever
feeling
you
have
against
that
it
seems
to
me
comes
from
the
home
is
the
castle
point
of
view,
once
you
acknowledge
that
place
restrictions
on
speech
are
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
entitle
you
to
do
it.
i
mean,
sleeping
in
a
park
has
special
impact,
too,
but
we
don't
allow
people
to
sleep
in
some
parks,
even
if
that
would
be
the
very
best
place
to
make
your
message
known,
so
long
as
there
are
other
adequate
ways.
now,
the
community
here
has
said
for
some
purposes
yes,
you
have
to
use
your
house...
for
example,
if
you're
putting
your
house
up
for
sale.
then
there
is
a
special
need
to
have
the
sign
there.
that's
a
very
reasonable
exception.
but
simply
to
say
that
any
message
in
the
world
you
have
to
be
able
to
hang
a
sign
on
your
house
about
it,
i...
except
for
the
fact
that
i
feel
strongly
about
a
person's
house
being
his
castle,
i
don't
see
why,
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
is
concerned,
there's
anything
distinctive
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
she
has
an
equivalent
right
to
speak
on
her
own
property,
at
least,
so
i
guess
the
city
could
not
prevent
her
from
setting
up,
you
know,
a
soapbox
and
holding
forth
about
the
evils
of
the
gulf
war,
or
about
her
favorite
political
candidate,
and
attracting
a
crowd
on
the
street
because
she's
a
very
good
speaker,
and
people
milling
around
in
this
residential
neighborhood.
you
couldn't
stop
that
because
she's
doing
it
on
her
own
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
you
can
do
time,
place,
and
manner,
but
not
this
place.
this
place
is
sacred.
she
can
speak,
she
can
put
up
signs,
can
do
anything
she
wants
because
it's
her
property.
is
that
the
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
goes
off
of
her
property,
is
that
it?
so
the
city...
as
far
as
i
know,
the
city
permits
signs
that
can't
be
seen
off
of
the
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
she
wants
to
put
a
sign
behind
a
hedge,
where
only
people
who
come
on
her
property
see
it,
that's
okay.
isn't
that
the
equivalent
of
letting
her
speak,
but
not
with
a
bullhorn?
she
can
speak
on
her
property,
but
don't
annoy
people
outside
the
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
visually...
this
is
visual
clutter.
isn't
that
the
words,
something
like
that?
it's
not
visually
silent.
it's
very
noisy
visually.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cherrick,
if
you
reject
the
notion
that
this
is
a
place
restriction
and
therefore
okay,
what
about
the
notion
that
it's
simply
a
manner
restriction
and
therefore
okay?
apparently,
any
sign
is
okay
so
long
as
it's
on
a
flag.
now,
that's
just
a
manner.
all
you
have
to
do
is
take
it
out
of
your
window,
put
it
on
a
rectangular
piece
of
cloth,
and
hang
it
outside.
it's
all
right.
that's
manner.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
american
flags,
any
flag.
any
piece
of
cloth
qualifies
as
a
flag
under
this
ordinance.
you
can
have
a
cloth
that
says,
"oppose
the
gulf
war",
and
hang
that
outside,
and
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
federal
government
have
a
one-sign
limit
in
the
highway
act?
does
it
let...
the
federal
government...
everybody
put
up
one
sign?
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
that
okay?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
lose
on
that
one.
i'm
much
more
concerned
about
what
i
have
to
see
when
i
look
out
my
front
window
than
i
am
about
what
i'm
driving
by
on
interstate
90.
gee,
i
think
the
interest
of
the
city
is
much
more
than
the
interest
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
do
it
on
a
federal
highway.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
reading
things
very
literally
today.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
city's
the
same.
i
think
signs
that
can't
be
seen
from
the
street
would
not
violate
the
city's
ordinance.
it's
exactly
like
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
--presumably
the
only
people
who
live
in
the
city
are
people
who
don't
like
signs.
that's
one
reason
they've
moved
there.
but
once
the
ordinance
is
gone,
gradually
the
neighborhood
will
change
and
you'll
have
all
sorts
of
people
coming
in.
[laughter]
