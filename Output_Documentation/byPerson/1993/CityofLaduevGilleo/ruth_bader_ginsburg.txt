mr.
cherrick,
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
the
ward
case
was
about
the
decibel
level.
it
was
turning
down
the
volume,
not
excluding
the
expression,
and
here,
it
seems
if
you're
going
to
use
the
ward
case
the
natural
application
would
be
to
say
you
can
regulate
the
size
of
the
sign,
you
could
regulate
the
number
of
signs,
but
how
can
you
use
ward,
which
is
turning
down
the
volume
but
not
excluding
expression,
as
a
justification
for
saying
you
cannot
have
any
sign
of
this
variety?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
shows
there's
a
greater
danger
of
proliferation
for
"peace
in
the
gulf"
than
"house
for
sale"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
nothing
is
better
than
something.
that's
essentially
your
argument,
that
it's
more
compatible
with
the
first
amendment
to
allow
nothing
than
to
have
a
regulation
that
specifies
a
uniform
size.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
didn't
this
come
to
light
because
of
a
complaint
that
the
sign
had
been
vandalized,
so
it
hadn't
been...
this
wasn't
a
case
of
initial
enforcement.
didn't
this
come
to
the
town's
attention
because
the
homeowner
complained
that
her
sign
had
been
vandalized?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
indication
that
if
she
hadn't
made
the
complaint,
or
the
sign
hadn't
been
disturbed,
anything
would
have
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cherrick,
is
your
position
that
you're
forced
into
the
flag
position
you've
just
taken
that
justice
scalia
just
questioned
as
irrational
by
this
court's
precedent
in
street,
the
peace
symbol
on
a
flag,
and
that
you're
forced
into
the
"for
sale"
because
of
this
court's
decisions
so
you're
preserving
what
you
can
but
of
course
recognizing
this
court's
precedent?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
she
had
a
wheelbarrow
that
she
rolled
onto
her
front
lawn
and
propped
up
the
sign
on
that,
would
that
violate
the
ordinance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
one
could
know
that
one
way
or
another
now
because
the
city
has
not
been
allowed
to
have
this
ordinance
for
sometime,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
i
think
for
some
3
years,
so
there
is...
it's
not
in
this
record,
but
it
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
the
community
that
justice
blackmun...
that
you
told
justice
blackmun
about
couldn't
now
see
the
light
and
say,
oh,
we
want
to
do
what
ladue...
because
they've
already...
they've
just
gone
downhill
and
they
can't
improve
their
situation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
every
city
that
wants
it
can
have
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
a
city
need
anything
more
than...
you're
not
suggesting
that
because
ladue
has
all
these
other
regulations
it
can
have
this
one
as
well,
or
are
you
suggesting
that?
if...
suppose
the
court
were
to
uphold
the
ordinance,
then
couldn't
every
other
town
in
the
state
of
missouri
have
the
same
ordinance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
copy
this
ordinance
word
for
word.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
wanted
to
they
could,
though,
and
it
wouldn't
matter
that
they
didn't
have
a
fancy
city
planner
come
in
at
the
outset.
