chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
92-1856,
the
city
of
ladue
v.
margaret
gilleo.
mr.
cherrick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
cherrick,
why
would
a
rule
of
one
sign
per
house...
why
would
that
violate
this
court's
precedents?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
would
presumably
choose
the
right
to
speak
on
one
issue
rather
than
the
right
to
speak
on
no
issues.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
should
just
prohibit
the
debate
entirely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
come
up
in
the
administration
of
the
zoning
ordinance?
have
people
put
up
different
kinds
of
flags
with
different
messages
on
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cherrick,
where...
what
section
of
the
ordinance
is
it
that
deals
with
flags?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
ordinance
was
adopted
in
1935,
you
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
cases
have
come
up
since
1991
in
which
people
have
flown
flags
that
weren't
national
flags
or
state
flags,
or
that
sort
of
thing,
and
the
city
has
known
about
it
and
said
that's
perfectly
okay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cherrick.
mr.
greiman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
the
state
restrict
you
to
one
sign
per
house?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
order
of
magnitude
in
mind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
a
limitation
of
half
a
dozen
be
permissible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
limitation
as
to
size?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
she
holds
strong
views
about
selling
lemonade,
can
she
put
a
sign
up,
"lemonade
for
sale
at
this
house?
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
city
could
prohibit
that
sort
of
a
sign?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
it
were
just
a
flat
prohibition
of
all
commercial
signs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
she
wants
to
get
a
bullhorn
to
amplify
her
message?
can
the
city
prohibit
her
from
getting
a
bullhorn
to
speak
from
her
own
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
greiman.
mr.
bender,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
bender,
i
take
it
you
would
agree
with
that
last
comment,
that
the
highway
beautification
act
is
a
different--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
know
that
you
give
the
city
the
entire
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
perhaps
ought
to
be
accorded
them.
if
unlimited
proliferation
is
bad,
i
presume
they
think
that
considerable
proliferation
is
almost
equally
bad.
in
other
words,
the
idea
that
only
unlimited
proliferation
would
bother
them
i
don't
think
makes
much
sense.
it's
any
real
proliferation
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ordinance
says
proliferation,
not
unlimited
proliferation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
city
have
to
wait
until
there
is
a
clutter
problem
before
dealing
with
it?
i
think
we
said
in
city
of
renton
that
a
city
doesn't
have
to
wait
until
the
evils
materialize
before
dealing
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
mr.
cherrick,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cherrick.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
