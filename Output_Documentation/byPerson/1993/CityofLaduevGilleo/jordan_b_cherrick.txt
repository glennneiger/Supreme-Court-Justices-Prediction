mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
city
of
ladue,
a
small,
8-1/2
square
mile
residential
community,
has
the
right
to
protect
its
residents
from
the
proliferation
of
signs
that
causes
visual
blight,
harm
to
the
landscape,
safety
problems,
and
a
deterioration
of
real
estate
values.
we
submit
that
the
sign
ordinance
at
issue
here
today
is
constitutional
under
this
court's
time,
place,
or
manner
jurisprudence,
and
we
start
the
analysis
with
the
governmental
interests,
because
under
the
court's
opinion
in
frisby,
the
court
noted
that
the
governmental
interest,
the
strength
of
those
interests,
informs
the
application
of
the
test
and,
indeed,
those
interests
are
very
strong
in
this
case.
the
city
of
ladue
has,
since
its
very
inception
in
1936,
made
a
comprehensive
and
longstanding
commitment
to
the
preservation
of
its
beautiful,
aesthetic
community.
it
retained
a
renowned
urban
planner,
one
of
the
fathers
of
urban
planning
in
this
country,
harland
bartholomew,
to
devise
the
city
plan
which
it
has
consistently
followed.
the
sign
ordinance
is
an
essential
part
of
the
zoning
plan
and
the
comprehensive
plan.
it
is
designed
to
maintain
this
unique
aesthetic
ambience
of
this
community,
and
it
has
done
so
on
a
consistent
basis
not
only
with
respect
to
sign
regulation
but
with
respect
to
beautification
projects
and
other
issues
as
well.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
justice
o'connor,
we
think
that
the
exemptions
are
neutral
in
the
sense
that
under
ward
the
controlling
test
for
content
neutrality
was,
what
is
the
government's
controlling
purpose,
and
here,
the
narrow
exceptions
that
we
required
are
safety-related
and
those
that,
in
fact,
are
required
by
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
the
sense
that
there
are
no
ample
alternative
modes
of
expression,
such
as
an
onsite
sign.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
we
think
that
under
this
court's
jurisprudence...
for
example
in
the
linmark
case
the
court
held
that
real
estate
signs
must
be
allowed
because
there
are
no
ample
alternative
modes
of
expression.
so
what
ladue
is
doing
in
this
context
is
not
targeting
the
message,
it's
targeting
the
medium
of
signs,
and
it
is
also
attempting
to
allow
those
signs
where
there
is
no
alternative
onsite--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--justice
o'connor,
we
think
the
ordinance
does
survive
the
strict
scrutiny
test,
but
we
do
not
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
test,
because
what
is
at
issue
here
today
is,
in
the
lower
courts
what
actually
happened
is
that
the
courts
held
that
if
ladue
allows
any
exceptions
whatsoever,
the
ordinance
is
content-based,
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
we
think
that
that
places
cities
in
a
classic
catch-22
position,
because
on
the
one
hand,
under
the
court's
jurisprudence,
for
example,
in
linmark,
certain
signs
must
be
allowed
when
there
are
no
ample
alternatives.
a
safety--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
justice
kennedy,
under
the
ward
case
the
court
has,
of
course,
rejected
the
least
restrictive
alternative,
and
the
issue
is--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--justice
ginsburg,
proliferation
is
to
signs
what
volume
is
to
loud
music,
and
what
ladue
is
doing
here
is
focusing
and
targeting
the
medium
of
expression.
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
vincent
case
that
signs
have
a
unique
problem.
it
is
the
medium
that
creates
the
problem,
and
therefore
the
only
way
to
eliminate
this
problem
of
visual
blight
is
to
eliminate
the
medium.
we
think
the
logic
of
vincent
is
compelling
here
today.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
the
record
is
undisputed
that
signs
proliferate
in
neighboring
communities,
and
ladue
does
not
target
any
particular
message,
it
is
focused
on
the
medium,
so
that
this
ordinance
applies
and
prohibits
in
a
particular
place
signs
on
the
landscape,
controversial
signs,
noncontroversial,
political,
commercial,
noncommercial...
it
is
focused
on
this
medium.
but
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
that
you
asked
about
the
alternatives,
and
we...
even
though
the
least
restrictive
alternative
test
has
been
rejected,
we
cannot
achieve
the
government's
interest
here,
ladue's
unique
interest,
with
the
alternatives,
and
let
me
explain
if
we
look
at
some
of
these
alternatives.
if
we
limit
the
size,
for
example,
we
still
have
the
proliferation
problem.
there
is
still
the
multiplicity
of
these
signs
under
this
uncontested
record
that
are
displayed
and
clutter
up
the
windows
and
the
yards
and
the
trees
throughout
the
neighborhood.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
that
we
could
limit
the
number
of
signs.
well,
if
we
did
that,
we
would
come
right
up
against
this
court's
content-based
doctrine
which
prohibits
that,
because
if
we
limited
the
signs
to
a
minimum
of
one
per
household,
we'd
still
have
over
3,000
potential
signs.
but
in
addition
to
that,
we
would
have
the
problem
of
government
selecting
the
speaker
and
the
message,
because
there
could
be
multiple
political
races,
multiple
people
living
in
a
home,
yet
the
government
would
say
that
a
particular
house,
there
could
only
be
one
sign,
and
in
another
house
a
single
person
would
be
allowed
to
speak,
and
that
would
offend
this
court's
jurisprudence,
and
what
we
have
tried
to
do
is
to
comply
with
this
court's
first
amendment--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
because
under
this
ordinance
numerous
modes
of
expression,
ample
modes
of
expression
are
left
open
for
respondent
to
speak.
for
example,
a
bumper
sticker,
a
button...
those
are
inexpensive
personal
expressions
which
would
have
achieved
a
much
larger
audience
than
these
signs
placed
on
the
landscape
that
could
be
seen
from
the
street.
in
fact,
the
respondent
did
not
even
contest
the
issue
in
this
case
in
the
summary
judgment
proceedings
that
there
were,
in
fact,
ample
alternative
methods,
which...
we
have
affidavits
that
listed
over
20.
handbills
are
allowed.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
we
think
that
would
create
a
content-based
problem,
because
in
that
instance
the
government
in
effect
would
be
imposing
a
decision
to
be
made
by
individuals
that
in
a...
for
example,
the
multiple
issues
that
face...
people
want
to
speak
on,
they
would
have
to
put
a
sign
on
one
issue,
and
there
may
be--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
the
problem
would
be
is
that
you
would
have...
you
would
have
neighboring
people
who...
who,
for
example,
would
be
allowed
to
speak
on
a
specific
issue
because
they
would
have
the
one
sign,
and
there
may
be
just
one
person
living
in
that
house.
but
i
think
this
goes
back
to
the
rationale
of
the
content-based
doctrine
that
government
should
not
force
people
to
pick
and
choose
the
topics
for
public
debate,
and
in
fact
there
would
be
an
advantage
given
to
certain
households
over
the
others
where
this
is--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
mr.--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
debate
is
preserved
completely,
because
there
are
all
these
uncontested
ample
alternative
modes
of
expression...
handbills
and
pickets
and
fliers
and
bumper
stickers
and
buttons...
and
all
of
this
is
protected.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
well,
that...
those...
those--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
they
do--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--justice
stevens,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
vincent,
the
problem
of
handbills
can
be
dealt
with
in
different
ways.
you
have
a
littering
problem.
that
is
the
governmental
problem
here,
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
vincent
case,
and
as
your
dissenting
opinion
in
the
metromedia
case
points
out,
this
is
the
medium
that
causes
the
problem,
and
therefore
the
only
direct
and
effective
way
to
eliminate
the
problem
is
to
eliminate
the
medium.
it's
a
unique
type
of
situation.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no,
justice
stevens,
because
if
we
permitted
that
we
would
be
favoring
that
speech
over--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
the
record
is
clear
that
for
55
years
that
this
ordinance
has
been
consistently
enforced
and
applied
in
a
constitutional--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--yes,
and
the
town
enforced
this
consistently.
it
does
not
allow
any
political
or
nonpolitical
signs.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
well,
the
record
is
clear
that
whenever
there
have
been
signs
and
the
police
have
been
on
notice
of
it
they
have
applied
this
across
the
board
to
whatever
the
message...
whatever
sign
there
was
that
was
causing
the
problem,
and
i
stress
here,
too,
that
this
court
in
the
ward
case
pointed
out
that
deference
must
be
given
to
local
judgment
of
city
officials
to
deal
with
these
types
of
problems,
and
here
we
have--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--ward?
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
justice
kennedy,
because
it
is
focused
on
the
medium,
the
manner
of
expression...
signs...
at
a
particular
place,
signs
on
the
landscape
that
can
be
seen
from
the
street.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
souter,
vincent
and--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
signs
for
which
there
is
no--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
no,
in
this
respect--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--and
let
me
explain.
signs
where
there
is
no
ample
alternative
mode
of
expression,
this
court
in
vincent
and
ward
and
the
other
time,
place,
and
manner
cases
has
held
that
those
signs
must
be
allowed,
and
that's...
what
ladue
is
doing
here
is
allowing
those
signs
that
for
neutral
governmental
reasons
it
must
allow,
such
as
an
onsite
sign.
you
must
have
those
types
of
signs
to
get
to
a
particular
place.
a
safety
sign,
that
must
be
allowed.
a
real
estate
sign,
under
the
linmark
case,
must
be
allowed.
but
the--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--a
church
would
only
be
allowed
to
have
a
sign
identifying
the
church
and
what
is
going
on
at
that
particular
premises.
it
would
not
be
allowed
to
have
a
sign
placed
in
the
churchyard,
"say
no
to
abortion",
just
as
other
political
or
religious
or
commercial
signs
would
not
be
allowed,
but
that
is
an
onsite
sign
where
as
a
matter
of
public
necessity
and
convenience
people
must
know
what's
happening
at
the
church,
where
it
is--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
well,
those
signs
are
not,
naturally,
limited
in
number,
and
there
are
many
types
of
signs
that
can
be
placed
here,
and
the
record
is
undisputed
that
this
city
has
followed
the
counsel
of
some
of
the
most
expert
land-use
planners
to...
who
have
advised
the
city
that
this...
based
on
this
city's
unique
interest,
the
comprehensive
city
plan
and
the
zoning
interest,
this
is
necessary.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
well,
that's
correct,
and
it's
in
the
reasonable
judgment
of
city
officials,
as
this
court
has
said,
to
make
the
decision
about
what
is
beautiful
and
what
is
ugly
and
whether
sign
proliferation
should
be
allowed,
and
that
is
what
this
city
has
done,
and
has
done
so
in
a
constitutional
fashion
by
only
allowing
the
limited
safety
and
onsite
signs.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
that's
correct.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
that
was
a
land-use
judgment--
[laughter]
--a
judgment
made
by--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--no,
justice--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--it's
not
irrational.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
the
judgment
of
the
city
was...
is
that
there's
certain
types
of
signs
that
proliferate,
such
as
a
pennant
and
a
banner.
those
cause
more
aesthetic
problems
than
flags.
flags
have
never
presented
the
problem
that
the
city
was
faced
with.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
well,
the
city--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--justice
scalia,
the
city
made
a
reasonable
judgment
to
deal
with
this
problem,
and
it...
at
the
same
time
it
allowed
that
type
of
expression
on
a
flag
for
people
to
display
all
types
of
messages,
but
this
was...
the
city
was
trying
to
limit
its
ordinance
to
the
problems
that
it
saw,
and
under
the
burson
case
the
court
has
said
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
to
deal
with
problems
that
don't
confront
them,
but--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
they...
there
are
different...
people
can
put
different
messages
on
flags,
and
while
it
can
be
an
american
flag,
it
can
also
be
a
flag
containing
a
different
message,
but
the...
i
think
that--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--yes.
yes,
they
have,
and
those
have
been
allowed,
and
i
think
the
ultimate
question
as
on
a
constitutional
level
before
the
court
is
whether
this
court
is
going
to
act
as
second-guessing
a
land-use
decision,
part
of
a
comprehensive
land-use
plan.
will
it
make
the
judgment
that
certain
types
of
signs
should
be
permitted,
certain
types
of--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
the
city
is
trying
to
comply
with
this
court's
precedents,
while
at
the
same
time
achieving
the
city's
unique
aesthetic
interest,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
focus--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--yes,
justice
souter,
and
the
problem
that
the
lower
court
has
placed
the
city
and
other
cities
in
is
this
catch-22
problem,
because
the
lower
court
has
said
that
all
signs
must
be
banned.
there
can
be
no
exceptions,
yet
as
a
practical
matter,
how
can
a
city
exist
without
safety
signs?
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no,
justice
souter,
because
in
that
situation
the
city
was
making
a
judgment
that
flags
have
not
created
the
problem
of
proliferation
and
visual
blight,
and
so
therefore
it
permitted
that
unique
mode.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
and--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--that's
correct,
and
the
court
in
the...
the
lower
courts
have
created
this
very
difficult
problem
that
applies
not
only
for
a
city
like
ladue,
but
would
apply,
frankly,
in
other
contexts.
the
highway
beautification
act
follows
the
very
analogous
structure
of
the
ladue
ordinance.
it
prohibits
on
private
property
all
signs,
with
very
limited
exceptions,
very
closely
following
what
ladue
has
done.
it
allows...
it
does
not
allow
political
signs,
although
the
solicitor
general
is
now
taking
the
position
it
allows
a
few
political
signs.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
the...
it
is
the
definitional
section
under
page
120
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
definition
of
"sign"
does
not
include
flags,
and
a
flag
was
left
out
of
the
definitions
because
the
city
has
not
seen
that
as
a
problem
that
it
has
faced
with
respect
to
visual
blight.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no...
well,
the
present
ordinance
was
adopted
in
1991,
although
the
city
has
had
sign
ordinances
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
city.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes.
flags
have
never
been
prohibited,
and
for
example
there
are
halloween
flags
that
people
display,
family
name
flags,
these...
they
have
never
been
prohibited,
and
they
have
never
created
the
type
of
problem
the
city
had,
and
therefore
it
didn't
make
the
judgment
that
it
needed
to
prohibit
that
particular
mode
of--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--if
it
was
creating
a
problem.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
city's--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
there
is
an--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
justice
stevens,
there
is
an
uncontested
record
here
that
in
six
neighboring
communities,
residential
communities,
there
is
a
proliferation
of
small,
temporary
signs,
and
so
that
is
a
problem,
a
real
problem
that
exists
for
the
city.
in
addition,
there
is--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--in...
no,
six
neighboring
communities.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
that...
that's--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
those
cities
do
not
make
this
prohibition,
and
they
have
a
visual
blight--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
justice
stevens,
the
record
is
uncontested
also
that
one
of
the
effects
of
this
land-use
plan
and
this
zoning
ordinance--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--is
that
real
estate
values
are
increased.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no,
and
that
would
be
another
alternative
mode
of
expression.
it
would
be
very
easy
for
respondent
to
have
a
bumper
sticker
on
her
car,
or
a
sign
on
her
car,
and
the
reason,
justice
stevens,
is
that
what
ladue
is
focused
on
is
signs
attached
to
the
landscape.
people
are
captive
to
those
signs,
and
those
proliferate.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes,
but
it
is
important
to
consider
the
overall
land-use
plan,
not
the
individual
case,
and
under
a
typical
land-use
plan
like
this,
if
everyone
keeps
the
plan,
then
the
entire
community
benefits
in
terms
of
quality
of
life
and
real
estate
values.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
no,
but
that...
again,
we
think
it
is
not
appropriate
to
look
at
the
individual
case.
as
the
ward
court
pointed
out,
one
must
look
at
the
overall
governmental
purpose,
and
here
we're
dealing
with
a
land-use
plan,
a
comprehensive
zoning
plan,
and
you
have
to
look
at
all
of...
what
would
happen
if
ladue
allowed
one
sign,
it
would
allow
all
of
these
signs,
and
it
is
when
those
signs
that
are
attached
to
the
land,
that
is
when
the
visual
blight
and
the
proliferation
problem
exists,
and
therefore
that
is
the
reasonable
judgment
that
this
city
has
made.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
justice
blackmun,
the...
the
suburbs
are
indicated
on
pages
154
and
155
of
the
joint
appendix,
but
those
suburbs...
each
community
has
the
right,
in
our
view,
to
make
its
own
decisions
of
quality
of
life,
and
this
is
a
particularly--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--yes.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
justice
blackmun,
ferguson
would
be
one,
manchester
would
be
another,
that
were
mentioned
by
the
expert.
thank
you.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
fact
is,
there's
an
undisputed
record
in
the
summary
judgment
proceedings
that
in
six
neighboring
cities
there
was
sign
proliferation,
so
this
is
a
real
problem
that
the
city
faces.
with
respect
to
the
highway
beautification
act,
i
think--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--it
has
been
enjoined,
and--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--there's
nothing
in
the
record,
and
i
don't
think
you'd
want
me
to
discuss
what's
off
the
record
of
the
problems
that
have--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
the
limiting
principles
of
our
submission.
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
unique
aesthetic
community,
an
8-1/2-square-mile
community
that
has
comprehensively
protected
aesthetics
in
every
way
since
its
inception.
this...
it
is...
we're
also
dealing
with
an
ordinance
that
is
part
of
a
land-use
plan
and
a
zoning
ordinance
which
has
traditionally--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
up
to
every
city
to
define
its
sense
of
values,
its
sense
of
community,
and
we're
not
saying
that
every
city
has
to
have
this
ordinance.
what
we
are
saying
is--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--yes,
if
that's...
and
that
is
what
a
land-use
and
zoning
plan
is
all
about.
that
is
what
a
comprehensive
plan
is,
developing
a
sense--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--if
it
had
the
same
type
of
interest
that
ladue
has
and
did
it
in
a
constitutional
fashion,
but--
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
--well,
that
may
well
be
the
case,
but
not
all
cities
would
want
to
live
in
a
type
of
aesthetic
community
that
ladue
had.
mr.
jordan
b.
cherrick
yes.
yes,
that's
accurate,
much
as
the
highway
beautification
act
protects
the
highways,
but
the
question
before
the
court
is,
will
a
city
like
this
be
disabled
from
regulating
and
protecting
the
essential
values
that
it
has
had
since
its
very
inception,
and
is
the
court...
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
