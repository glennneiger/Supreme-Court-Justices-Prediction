mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start,
if
i
could,
with
the
text
of
203(b).
i
think
it's
clear
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
not
to
eliminate
the
tariff
filing
requirement.
we
think
that's
also
true
as
a
textual
matter.
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
to
make
the
requirement
conditional.
in
theory,
this
requirement
continues
to
exist
and
operate
for
every
carrier.
the
question
is
whether
the
carrier
meets
the
conditions
that
trigger
the
requirement.
it
seems
to
us
it
is
as
much
a
modification
of
a
requirement
to
change
the
conditions
that
trigger
it
as
to
change
the
obligations
that
are,
in
fact,
triggered.
the
commission
has
done
no
more
than
that
here.
additionally,
we
think
that
section
203(c),
in
fact
in
particular
the
first
sentence
of
203(c),
makes
clear
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
remove
the
tariff
obligation
entirely,
because
it
says
that
service
must
be
provided
under
tariff
unless
otherwise
provided
by
or
under
the
authority
of
the
act.
plainly,
section
203(b)(2),
in
our
view,
which
is
the
very
preceding
sentence
in
the
act,
is
authority
conferred
in
the
act
to
remove
the
tariff
filing
obligation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
10
years
ago,
your
honor,
mci
took
that
position
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
now
think
that
that
position
is
wrong.
we've
thought
that
position
was
wrong
for
many
years,
and
we
tried
to
indicate
that
in
our
brief
at
footnote
5,
our
reply
brief.
in
any
event,
it's
our
view
now
that
this
statute
is
capable
of
the
meaning
that
the
commission
has
ascribed
to
it,
which
under
chevron
is
all
that
ought
to
be
required
to
trigger
deference.
but,
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
10
years
ago
mci
made
that
argument.
we
think,
though,
that
the
reading
that
we're
advancing
today
is
the
better
reading,
particular
given
section
203(c),
which
makes
clear
that
the
requirement
can
be
removed.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
shows--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
logic
must
be
that
if
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
remove
it
in
some
circumstances,
therefore
the
necessary
implication
is
that
it's
not
in
those
circumstances
indispensable
to
the
functioning
of
title
ii
if
the
logic
that
would
allow
the
commission
to
take
that
step
exists
with
respect
to
10
carriers
and
also
exists
with
respect
to
a
hundred
or
four
hundred
carriers,
that
there's
no
natural
stopping
place.
that
if
the
logic
works
for
that...
for
the
small
number
of
carriers
and
the
logic
works
equally
well
for
the
large
number
of
carriers,
the
commission
ought
to
have
the
discretion
to
expand
that
power
to
include
a
large
number
of
carriers.
there's
simply
no
policy
justification
for
saying,
well,
it's
okay
to
exempt
10,
but
it's
not
okay
to
exempt
400.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
so
long...
there
are
special
circumstances
here,
which
is
the
lack
of
market
power.
the
requirement
hasn't
been
eliminated,
it's
been
made
conditional,
so
the
commission
has
remained
faithful
to
the
text.
and
as
long
as
it
has
done
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
we're
not.
i
think
the
logic
of
our
position
is
that
mandatory
detariffing
would,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
be
a
permissible
step.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
section
203,
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
correct.
i'd
also
like
to
focus
for
a
minute
on
what
i
take
to
be
at&t's
central
argument,
which
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
correct,
thank
you.
what
i
take
to
be
at&t's
central
argument
is
that
title
ii
of
the
act
cannot
be
enforced
absent
tariff
filings.
we
think
that
that
is
simply
wrong.
although
tariff
filing
is
one
method
of
enforcing
an
antidiscrimination
provision,
it
is
clearly
not
the
only
method.
the
commission
has
made
a
decision
here,
in
its
discretion,
that
it
wants
to
use
the
complaint
process
as
the
statutory...
as
the
principal
enforcement
method.
that
is
a
decision
that
is
owed
substantial
deference.
it's
a
reasonable
policy
decision,
particularly
given
at&t's
concession
that
nondominant
carriers
can't
charge
unreasonable
or
discriminatory
rates.
indeed,
many
non...
many
price
discrimination
statutes,
the
antitrust
laws,
the
robinson-patman
act,
state
unfair
competition
laws,
are
routinely
enforced
without
any
requirement
of
published
rates.
the
logic
that
allows
those
statutes
to
function
is
a
logic
on
which
the
commission
ought
to
be
entitled
to
rely
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
they
do
operate
on
the
assumption,
justice
scalia,
that
the
very
existence
of
competitors
is
likely
to
ferret
out
the
price
discrimination,
and
that
competitors
have
an
incentive
to
find
out
what
the
other
competitors
are
charging,
and
that
customers
have
an
incentive
to
disclose
the
best
offers
they're
getting
from
one
competitor
in
order
that
another
competitor
can
come
in
and
meet
or
beat
that
price.
and
therefore
it's
a
matter
of
disclosure
of
the
rates
being
offered
that
counts
here,
that
makes
the
enforcement
mechanism
work,
and
that's
the
kind
of
logic
the
commission
relied
on
here.
in
our
judgment,
that
was
plainly
a
reasonable
decision.
the
third
point
i'd
like
to
make
is...
if
i
could,
is
that
it
would,
in
our
view,
be
an
unwarranted
extension
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine
to
apply
maislin
here.
in
our
view,
by
far
more...
the
case
most
on
point
is
permian
basin.
in
permian
basin
this
court
faced
an
analog
to
the
question
faced
today;
does
an
agency
have
the
statutory
authority
to
remove
a
tariff
obligation,
in
that
case,
the
tariff
obligations
of
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act.
in
permian,
this
court
squarely
held
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
that
authority.
and
it
did
so
in
a
statute,
section
4
of
the
federal
power
act,
that
imposed
an
unequivocal
obligation
on
every
carrier
to
file
all
rates.
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act
also
imposed
a
nondiscrimination
and
a
reasonable
pricing
requirement,
just
as
does
the
communications
act.
in
fact,
the
natural
gas
act
was
modeled
on
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
was
passed
in
1938.
despite
all
that,
this
court
concluded
that
the
federal
power
commission
did
not
exceed
its
statutory
authority
in
removing
that
requirement
for
small
producers
of
natural
gas.
now,
that
exemption
from
the
tariff
requirement
in
permian
basin,
if
one
goes
back
and
reads
the
agency
decision
at
34
federal
power
commission
235,
applied
to
2,000
of
the
2,100
producers
of
natural
gas
who,
in
the
aggregate,
produced
15
percent
of
the
natural
gas
supply.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
think
that
the
proper
role
of
the
agency
ought
to
be
respected
here,
just
as
it
was
in
permian
basin,
recognizing
that
the
tariff
mechanism
needs
to
be
adjusted
in
light
of
changed
circumstances.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
that
may
or
may
not
be
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
that
seems
to
me
to
be
in
the
bailiwick
of
the
agency.
the
agency's
made
a
decision
that
this...
that
removal
of
tariffs
in
this
circumstance
will
advance
the
public
interest,
will
make
this
market
more
efficient
and
more
competitive,
and
in
our
view
that's
a
judgment
that
ought
to
be
respected.
we
think
there's
just
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
question
that
was
at
issue
in
maislin,
whether
a
filed
rate
must
be
followed,
and
the
question
at
issue
here,
where
the
agency...
whether
the
agency
has
the
statutory
authority
to
remove
that.
we
think,
as
we
said,
that
the
text
of
203,
particularly
focusing
on
that
first
sentence
of
203(c),
makes
clear
that
the
fcc
has
that
authority.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
