modify
including
at&t
or
just
the
nondominant
carriers?
could
you
do
away
with
the
rate
filing
altogether,
or
is
your
position
just
that
you
can
do
away
with
it
with
respect
to
nondominant
carriers?
justice
ruth

there
was
a
time
when
the
commission
took
a
different
view
of
203,
was
there
not,
that
203
required
rates
to
be
filed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
give
"modify"
a
very
broad
reading...
and
you
are
explicit
about
that,
you
say
it
means
more
than
the
word
"exempt",
is
that
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
yet,
in
legal
litany
modify
is
usually
a
kind
of
an
inbetween
word,
like
courts
have
authority
to
affirm,
modify,
or
reverse
a
lower
court
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
meaning
is
that
in
terms
of
numbers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
wasn't
there
a
point
made
that
at
the
time
this
act
was
passed
perhaps
that
definition
wasn't
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
verrilli,
in
terms
of
the
mci's
position
that
the
fcc
must
require
rate
filing
and
it
could
not
do
away
with
that
requirement
either
on
a
mandatory
or
even
a
permissive
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
wanted
to
establish
that
the
10
years
ago,
so
at
least
you
found
a
plausible
basis
for
making
the
argument
that
you
made
successfully
10
years
ago.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
still
of
the
view
that
the
mandatory
no
filing
would
be
impermissible,
so
that
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
really
have
come
180
degrees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
put
forward
by
the
fcc
that
the
statute
would
be
redundant
if
all
that
203(d)
would
do
that
job?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
203(c).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
verrilli
said
that
our
guide
should
be
permian
basin
and
not
maislin.
