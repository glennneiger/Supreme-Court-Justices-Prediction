of
course,
the
position
you
advocate
today
is
advocated
by
an
older,
wiser,
and
more
experienced
lawyer.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
carpenter,
do
you
think
they
could
modify
the
filing
requirement
by
changing
the
agency
where
the
rates
are
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
said
we'll
file
them
in
the
sales
office
of
corporate
headquarters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
quibbling,
because
i
imagine
they
may
do
that.
they
may...
they
may
have
all
their
people
know
what
the
rates
are,
just
file
them,
and
have
them
open
for
public
inspection
at
the
home
office.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
interrupt
you
a
minute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
will
agree
they
don't
have
to
file
them
with
the
commission,
what
is
it
in
the
statute
that
says
they
must
file
them
with
some
other
public
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
somewhere
must...
could
not
be
their
own
corporate
offices
open
to
the
public
if
anybody
wants
to
come
in
and
look
at
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
i
understand,
your
opponents'
position
is
that
we
should
really
treat
this
as
sort
of
a
robinson-patman
act;
as
long
as
they're
nondiscriminatory
and
they
adhere
to
uniform
rates
and
so
forth,
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
served.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
most
economists
take
the
view
that
in
a
true
competitive
market
there
cannot
be
economic
discrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
carpenter,
just
on
the
example
you
just
gave
us
about
the
grant
relief
and
how
broad
that,
when
did
congress
enact
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
that's
in
the
original,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
your
opponent
would
agree
that
that's...
i
don't
think
your
opponent
would
agree
that
that
statute
would
be...
you
would
be
right
under
that
statute,
because
he
says
this
is
not
a
modification
requirement,
including
the
filing
requirement.
