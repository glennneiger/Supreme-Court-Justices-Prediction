justice
antonin
scalia
sort
of
the
act
is
no
longer
necessary,
it's
a
fully
competitive
industry,
and
we'll
simply
modify
the
act
to
no
longer
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
is
it
that...
i
think
you
acknowledged
that
the
only
purpose
of
the...
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
not
only
to
assure
reasonable
rates,
but
also
to
prevent
price
discrimination,
and
i
don't
know
why
it
is
so
self-evident
that
when
there
is
competition
there
cannot
be
effective
price
discrimination.
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
ever
bought
a
new
car?
a
very
competitive
industry,
but
unless
you're
a
good
negotiator
you're
not
going
to
get
as
good
a
price
as
somebody
who
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
urging
us
to
believe
at&t,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
particular.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
another
way
to
put
it
is
that
it's
been
eliminated
for
all
of
the
interstate
market
except
at&t.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
requirement's
eliminated
for
everybody
in
that
whole
market
except
at&t.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
one
of
its
meanings.
it's
its
normal
meaning.
i
mean,
you
say
you
have
ninth...
there
are
bad
dictionaries,
just
like
there
are
bad
regulations.
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of
english
words
that
come
from
the
same
latin
root,
all
of
which
have
a
connotation
of
limitation.
moderate,
modulate,
even
the
word
modest,
it
all
comes
from
the
same
root,
and
they
all...
a
root
which
means
measure,
and
they
all
contain
that
limitation
of
measured,
limited,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
"modify"
bears
that
same
connotation
as
all
of
them.
i
don't
care
what
one
edition
of
webster's
might
have
said
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
make
a
basic
or
important
change,
that's
what
"modify"
means,
to
make
a
basic
change?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
wonderful...
wonderful
line
sung
by
the
bass
in
the
messiah,
mr.
wright,
where
it
says
"and
we
shall
be
changed".
there's
a
feeling
of
transformation
about
it,
and
you
say
that
could
be
sung
"and
we
shall
be
modified".
[laughter]
they
really
convey
the
same
notion.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
other
language,
mr.
wright?
it
not
only
says
"modify"
but
also
says
"in
special
circumstances".
do
i
have
the
language
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
the
"special
circumstances"
could
be
that
the
entire
industry
is
now
competitive.
the
special
circumstance
is,
what,
1993?
justice
antonin
scalia
today
is
a
special
circumstance.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
specified
circumstances.
it
says
"special
circumstances".
don't
you
think
that
contains
a
connotation
of
limitation;
not
general
circumstances
applicable
to
the
entire
industry,
but
special
circumstances,
some
limit?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
okay,
now
we're
just
arguing
about
how
special
"special"
has
to
be,
but
that
already
backs
you
off
of
your
initial
position,
which
is
that
really
it
could
extend
to
the
entire--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
"special
circumstances"
can
include
everything;
the
entire
realm
of
communications
can
be
special
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
if
the
commission
says
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
you're
both
wrong.
i
mean
maybe
they
can
affect
tariffs,
but
not
all
of
them.
maybe
they
can
suspend
one
now
and
then
or
whatnot.
i
don't
think
we're
driven
to
take
either
view
in
particular.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
that
that
gets
you
is
that
you
can
remove
some...
you
can
modify
tariffs,
just
as
you
can
modify
other
things.
it
doesn't
necessarily
show
that
you
can
make
the
kind
of
massive
modification
to,
in
effect,
detariff
an
entire
segment
of
the
industry,
save
for
one
provider,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
all
it
shows
is
that
you
can
affect
tariffs.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
still
left
with
the
problem
of,
you
know,
how
far
"modify"
takes
you
and
what
are
"special
circumstances".
justice
antonin
scalia
just
a
textual
justification,
the
word
"modify"
and
the
word
"special
circumstances".
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
so
has
the
commission,
so
has
at&t.
i
mean
there's
enough
of
that
to
go
around,
isn't
there?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
also...
those
statutes
are
applied
to
competitive
industries
as
well.
i'm
not
sure
those
statutes
help
you.
i
mean,
they...
those
statutes
operate
on
the
assumption
that
the
mere
presence
of
competition
does
not
eliminate
price
discrimination.
indeed,
the
price
discrimination
is
a
tool
that's
often
used
most
often
in
fiercely
competitive
industries.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
let...
you
want
us
to
allow
the
fcc
to
do
for
communications
what
the
federal
power
commission
did
for
the
energy
industry?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
impression
is
that
permian
basin
was
the
first
step
to
a
real
regulatory
diaster
which
we've
ended
up
sorting
out
during
the
past
decade
with
great
difficulty.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i
don't...
i
really
didn't...
i
didn't
follow
you
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
why
is
it
not
an
explicit
exemption?
i
can
understand
how
you
can
quarrel
about
the
scope
of
it,
but
surely
it's
an
explicit
exemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
position
is
that
they
cannot
exempt
any
carrier
at
any
time,
no
matter
the
circumstance
and
no
matter
how
narrow
the
circumstance,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
carpenter,
what
provisions
do
you
think
the
modification
provision
applies
to?
if
it
doesn't
apply
to
tariff,
what
does
it
apply
to,
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
the
point
i'm
getting
at
is
are
you
willing
to
apply
your
categorical
notion
that
modify
cannot
include
elimination,
not
even
elimination
in
narrow
circumstances.
for
example...
to
the
other
things
that
it
covers.
for
example,
to
whether
you
have
to
apply
schedules
to
each
of
your
connecting
carriers.
i
suppose
you're
compelled
to
take
the
position
that
there
can
be
no
exceptions,
no
complete
exceptions
to
say
that
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
a
federal
agency
gets
into
the
telecommunications
business
and
its
rates
are
published
in
the
federal
register
pursuant
to
its
statute,
could
the
fcc
say
that
the
rates
of
that
particular
carrier
do
not
have
to
be
filed
under
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i'm
just
testing
about
whether
you're
really
categorical--
justice
antonin
scalia
--about
you
must
file
tariffs.
i
find--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
find
that
a
very
hard
argument
to
sustain.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
carpenter,
what
do
you
respond
to
the
argument
that
the
existence
of
competition
is
a
special
circumstance?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
file
at
all.
the
small
producers
did
not
file.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
okay,
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
carpenter,
i'm
a
little
troubled
about
tocsia.
do
we
use
an
acronym
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
telephone
tocsia.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
that
legislation
did
assume
that
there
was
no
filing
requirement.
do
you
contest
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
did
the
legislation
make
any
sense,
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
there
was
a
filing
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you'd
say
the
carriers
would
have
had
to...
in
addition
to
that,
although
it
overlapped,
would
have
to
comply
in
it...
with
203
generally?
justice
antonin
scalia
noncarriers.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
well,
they
would
allow
it
to
be
filed
by
somebody
else,
so
long
as
it's
out
there
somewhere,
and
that's
eliminating
the
tariff
filing.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
if
a
provision
like
this
existed
under
the
civil
aeronautics
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
title
47
of
the
united
states
code
section
203(a)
requires
communication's
common
carriers
to
file
tariffs
with
the
federal
communications
commission,
and
section
203(b)(2)
authorizes
the
commission
to
"modify
any
requirement
made
by
or
under
this
section".
relying
on
its
modification
authority,
the
commission
issued
an
order
reaffirming
its
decision
to
make
the
tariff
filing
requirement
of
section
203(a)
optional
for
all
non-dominant
carriers,
which,
in
the
long
distance
market,
means
every
carrier
accept
respondent,
at&t.
at&t
filed
a
motion
with
the
court
of
appeals
seeking
summary
reversal
of
the
fcc's
order.
the
court
of
appeals
granted
that
motion
based
on
its
prior
decision
which
had
determined
that
the
commission's
policy
of
permissive
detariffing
violated
section
203(a).
in
a
decision
announced
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
commission's
policy
of
permissive
detariffing
exceeds
its
authority
to
modify
any
requirement
of
this
section.
virtually
every
dictionary
in
use
currently
and
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
defines
modify
to
mean
to
change
moderately
or
in
a
minor
degree.
the
conclusion
that
section
203(b)(2)
does
not
contemplate
major
or
fundamental
changes
as
supported
by
the
fact
that
its
only
exception
deals
with
a
minor
matter.
the
commission,
by
virtue
of
that
exception,
may
not
lengthen
the
required
period
for
giving
notice
of
tariff
changes
beyond
120
days.
the
commission's
permissive
detariffing
policy
does
not
qualify
as
a
non-fundamental
modification.
the
tariff
filing
requirement
is
the
heart
of
the
communications
act
and
the
elimination
of
it
for
all
but
one
long
distance
carrier
and
for
40%
of
long
distance
customers
is
not
a
mere
modification.
likewise,
a
condition
that
applies
to
that
many
carriers
is
not
special
and
the
commission's
authority
to
modify
by
general
order
which
is
what
happened
here
is
limited
to
special
circumstances
or
conditions.
the
commission's
attempt
to
include
its
permissive
detariffing
policy
within
the
meaning
of
modify
is
more
than
that
statutory
term
can
bear.
accordingly,
its
interpretation
is
not
entitled
to
deference.
both
sides
point
to
legislation
that
they
claim
was
premised
on
their
view
of
the
statute,
but
there
has
been
no
consistent
history
of
legislation
to
which
either
side's
interpretation
is
essential.
finally,
although
the
petitioners
offer
several
arguments,
suggesting
that
their
interpretation
better
serves
the
act's
broad
goal
of
promoting
efficient
telephone
service,
those
arguments
should
be
addressed
to
congress.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
blackmun
and
souter
have
joined.
justice
o'connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
