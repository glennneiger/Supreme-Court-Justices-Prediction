could
it
go
so
far
as
to
say
nobody
has
to
file
a
tariff?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
draw
the
distinction,
market
power?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
a
reason,
but
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
text?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
position
would
be
it
would
not
be
reasonable.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
think
it
would
be
reasonable
for
us
to
take
the
position
that
it
would
not
be
reasonable.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
think
we
just
want
to
know
whether
we
accept
your
position
here...
and
if
your
position
here,
do
we,
in
effect,
and
by
implication,
go
the
whole
hog?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
rule
is
that
when
the
general
circumstances
are
different
from
the
predicate
for
the
original
legislation,
as
long
as
this
modification
power
is
in
there,
in
effect
the
legislation
can,
in
effect,
be
repealed
by
the
commission.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
wouldn't
either,
if
i
were
arguing
your
side
of
the
case.
[laughter]
but,
i
mean,
that's
where
you
go,
isn't
it?
