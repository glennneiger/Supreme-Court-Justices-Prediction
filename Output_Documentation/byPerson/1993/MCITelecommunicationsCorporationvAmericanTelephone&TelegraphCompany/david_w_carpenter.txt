mr.
david
w.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
has
given
the
fcc
the
power
to
exempt
a
broad
and
concededly
potentially
unlimited
class
of
communications
common
carriers
from
a
statutory
requirement
that
was
copied,
almost
verbatim,
from
those
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
that
is
utterly
central
to
the
statutory
scheme
for
the
same
reasons
this
court
identified
in
the
maislin
case.
and
we
submit
that
it's
very
clear
from
the
language
of
the
act,
both
203
looked
at
in
isolation
and
in
context
of
the
act
as
a
whole,
and
from
its
history,
that
the
communications
act
just
isn't
susceptible
to
the
fcc's
interpretation,
which
was
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
but
that
even
if
the
statutory
terms
were
ambiguous,
a
century
of
decisions
of
this
court,
reaffirmed
recently
in
maislin
and
the
'86
square
d
decision,
established
that
exceptions
to
statutory
filed
rate
requirements
can't
be
inferred
from
general
or
ambiguous
provisions,
and
there's
no
way
that
section
203(b)
is
an
explicit
exemption.
the
statute--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--didn't
follow
that.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
as
i
say,
we
say
the
statute
is
not...
203(b)
can't
be
read
as
authorizing
what
they
want
to
authorize,
which
is
exempting
carriers
from
the
requirement
of
203(a)
that
they
file
all
their
rates,
or
the
requirement
of
203(c)
that
they
charge
only
filed
rates.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that
is
our
position,
that's
correct.
they
cannot
exempt.
they
can
modify
the
requirement,
but
they
can't
exempt.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
they
cannot
remove
the
requirement
that
carriers
file
all
their
charges
somehow,
someplace,
somewhere,
and
the
requirement
that
they
charge
only
the
rates
that
they'd
filed,
except
in
the
situations
where
the
statute
explicitly
authorizes
exceptions,
and
there
are
many
such
exceptions.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
they
cannot
do.
they
cannot
remove
the
requirement
that
every
carrier
file
all
its
charges,
and
they
can't
remove
the
parallel
requirement
that
carriers
charge
only
filed
rates.
that's
our
position,
and
that
follows
from
the
terms
of
the
statute.
203(a)
requires
every
carrier
to
file
all
charges.
203(c),
just
the
flip
side,
prohibits
a
carrier
from
charging
unfiled
rates,
and
203(b)
only
requires
that
the
fcc
may
modify
any
requirement
of
the
statute
in
particular
circumstances.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
yes,
in
fact,
both
circuits
that
have
adopted
the
interpretation
that
we're
advocating,
the
second
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit,
have
allowed
precisely
that.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
we're
now
quibbling...
we're
now
quibbling
about
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--well,
the
question
ultimately...
i
think
they
have
to
be
filed
in
some
public...
public
agency,
but
the
question
ultimately
boils
down
to
this,
you
cannot
enforce
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yeah.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
what
is
it...
what
is...
my
position
ultimately
is
that
they
can
modify
the
requirements
of
203(b),
and...
but
they
can't
modify
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
which
they
concede,
and
the
courts
have,
you
know,
long
held
that
the
publication
and
filing
of
the
rates
somehow,
someplace,
somewhere,
is
ultimate...
is
central
to
the
enforcement
of
all
these
other
provisions
of
the
statute
that
can't
be
modified:
the
ban
on
unreasonable
discrimination,
the
requirement
that
rates
be
just
and
reasonable.
so
unless
the
rates
are
filed
and
published
somewhere,
those
other
provisions
can't
be
enforced
and
won't...
the
statutory--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--the...
that
being
so
far
from
this
case,
i'm...
you
know,
i
guess
my
position
is
it
should
be
a
public
agency
because
i'm
not
confident
that
they
really
would
be
open
anywhere
else.
but
that's
so
far
from
this
case--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--no,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
wouldn't
be
served
in
that
event
because
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
assure
that
all
similarly
situated
customers
pay
equal
rates.
and
what...
and
these
quotations
of
at&t
positions
taken
out
of
context,
you
know,
we
freely
acknowledge
that
if
there's
no
market
power,
that
you
obviously
won't
have
rate
differences
that
result
from
exercises
of
market
power.
but
for
the
reasons
that
i
understood
justice
scalia
to
be
identifying,
in
a
competitive
market
you
are
always
going
to
have
rate
differences.
and
you
have
rate--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--there...
absolutely,
there
cannot
be
economic
discrimination
and
there
cannot
be
anticompetitive
discrimination
in
a
competitive
market,
but
there
will
be
rate
differences
between
similarly
situated
customers,
and
this
statute
rests
on
the
ground
that
you
want
to
prevent
those.
and
the
certain
and
direct
method
of
preventing
those
kinds
of
rate
differences,
which
is
what
the
statute
is
directed
at,
is
requiring
that
they
be
published
so
that
all
similarly
situated
customers
can
known
of
them
and
demand
them.
and
that
this
court's
held
many
many
years
that
that
was
the
congressionally
prescribed
means
of
carrying
out
the
statute,
and
it's
for
this
reason
that
in
maislin
you
held
that
exceptions
to
the
rate-filing
requirements
can't
be
inferred
even
from
facially
applicable
provisions.
there
it
was
the
ban
on
reasonable
practices,
and
the
conduct
at
issue
there
was,
in
my
view,
fraudulent,
was
an
unreasonable
practice
under
normal
interpretation
of
that
term.
but
you
refused
to...
the
court
refused
to
construe
the
term
broadly
because
that
would
undercut
the
central
provision
of
the
statute,
essential
to
achieving
all
these
other
purposes,
and
that
you
said
you
wouldn't
allow
exceptions
to
the
rate-filing
requirements
unless
they
were
explicit
in
the
statute.
and
that
rule,
we
submit,
would
control
here
if
you
reached
the
issue,
but
i
would
submit
you
don't
have
to,
that
the
d.c.
circuit
was
correct
that
you
cannot
construe
the
term
"modify"
broadly
to
allow
the
removal
of
the
rate-filing
requirements
for
any
carrier.
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief...
you
know,
this
battle
of
the
dictionaries
is
one
we've
been
fighting...
certainly
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
and
the
term
in
effect
in
the
dictionaries
at
the
time
the
statute...
the
definition
in
effect
when
the
statute
was
passed
wouldn't
allow
exemptions.
mci
has
this
argument
now
that
"modify"
means
make
conditional,
which
means
that
it
authorized
conditional
exemptions.
that's
not
a
definition
of
"modify",
but
even
if
it
were
the
text
of
the
statute
forecloses
this
because
it
says
modify
in
special
conditions.
as
they
say,
page
8
of
their
brief,
they
want
to
read
"modify"
so
it
means
remove
the
tariff-filing
requirements
in
special
conditions.
they're
just
rewriting
the
statute.
the
statute
says
modify
particular
circumstances
or
conditions,
and
they
want
to
rewrite
it
to
say
remove.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
what
provisions
of
203
can
be
modified?
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
well,
i
got
in
trouble
when
i
referred
to
the
first
one,
which
is
where
the
rates
be
filed.
and
the
other
one,
which
is...
has
been
a
big
issue
in
the
past
is
what
constitutes
a
rate
schedule.
obviously,
in
the
ordinary
meaning
a
rate
schedule
or
a
tariff
is
a
price
list,
and
it's
something
that
you
can
place
an
order
under.
you
see
the
list
of
prices
and
you
go
to
the
carrier
and
you
place
an
order
under
the
tariff.
well,
the
icc
has
interpreted
the
statute
to
allow
the
filing
of
ordinary
contracts,
contracts
between
customers
and
carriers,
which
aren't,
you
know,
price
lists
that
you
can
place
an
order
under;
they
only
apply
between
the
parties.
and
the
courts
have
held
that
that's...
that
that's
a
permissible
modification
because
it
doesn't
undercut
the
other
purposes
of
the
statute,
because
the
rates
are
filed
so
similarly
situated
customers
can
request
them.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
fear
i
may
be,
to
some
extent,
misleading
you.
our
position
is
they
can
modify
the
requirements...
the
filing
requirements
of
the
statute,
and
that
in
deciding
what
that
means
you
have
to
look
at
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute
for...
to
which
the
filing
requirements
are
centrally
important.
and
the
key
thing,
as
you
said
in
maislin,
is
that
the
rates
charged
each
customer
be
stated
in
or
ascertainable
from
the
public
filing.
so
if
that
purpose
is
being
served,
i
think
they
can
do
lots
of
things
to
these
other
requirements,
so
long
as
that
purpose
is
served.
and
the
example
i
just
gave
you,
where
they
allowed
things
that
aren't
traditional
rate
schedules,
would
be
an
example
of
the
modification
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute
that
does
modify
the
requirements
of
203
but's
consistent
with
the
statute
as
a
whole
because
it
doesn't
affect
the
enforcement
of
the
other
provisions
that
the
filing
requirement
is
designed
to
serve.
so
there's
all
sorts
of
things
that
i
could
imagine
being
done
in
modifying
the
requirements
of
203,
but
the
one
thing
that
can't
be
done,
which
is
that
there
can't
be
any
modification
of
the
requirement
that
the
rates
and
the
terms
and
conditions
affecting
the
rates
be
filed
so
that
similarly
situated
customers
are
in
a
position
where
they
can
know
what
they
are
and
demand
them.
which
is
what...
what
this
court's
held
really
for
a
century,
going
back...
you
know,
all
the
decisions
you
cited
in
maislin
stand
for
the
proposition
that
this
rate-filing
requirement
that
the
rates
be
filed
somehow,
someplace,
somewhere,
is
utterly
central
to
the
statute
as
a
whole.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
to
answer
your
hypothetical
question,
i
could
imagine
someone
arguing
that
the
statutory
purposes
were
adequately
served
in
that
circumstance.
happily,
in
this
circumstance
there's
no
dispute
that
the
statutory
purposes
aren't
being
served,
because
the
rates--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
what
i'm
categorical...
no,
your
honor--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--well,
i
think
you...
i
think
what
i'm
categorical
about
is
that
carriers
cannot
be
excused
from
the
obligation
that
they
file
their
rates.
they
don't
have
to
look
like
tariffs,
they
maybe
don't
have
to
be
filed
at
the
fcc.
i'm
categorical
about
the
fact
that
the
requirements
of
the
statute
can
be
modified
up
to
the
point
that
there's
no
interference
with
the
core
of
the
statute
which
is...
goes
to
the
whole
statute,
not
just
203,
that
the
rates
be
published
so
that
everyone
knows
what
they
are
and
so
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
statute
can
be
enforced.
and--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--203(c).
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yeah.
well,
this
is
mr.
verrilli's
argument,
that
the
language
of
section
203...
and
the
fcc's,
that
the
language
of
section
203
shows
that
you
have
to
read
section
203(b)
to
authorize
the
kind
of
exemptions
that
we
say
are
prohibited.
but
that's
just
wrong.
i
mean,
section
203(c)
says
that
carriers
have
to
charge
only
filed
rates,
except
as
provided...
unless
otherwise
provided
by
or
under
the
authority
of
this
chapter.
it
says
chapter,
not
section.
if
it
were
referring
to
203(b),
it
would
say
section.
and
it's
argued
in
the
reply
that
there's
no
other
provision
in
the
statute
that
authorizes
exceptions
to
the
requirement...
that...
in
which
the
fcc
is
authorized
to
create
exceptions
to
the
requirement
that
carriers
charge
only
filed
rates,
but
that's
just
untrue
too.
in
our
brief,
page
20,
note
26,
we
list
a
number
of
examples,
and
in
each
of
them
the
fcc
is
delegated
authority
to
enter
orders
or
take
other
actions
that
will
have
the
affect
of
excusing
carriers
from
the
obligation
that
they
file...
they
charge
only
filed
rates.
just
to
take
one
of
them,
the
first
one
we
list
is
201(b)
and
211,
which
say...
201(b)
which
is
page
1a
of
our
statutory
appendix,
says
that
nothing
in
this
chapter
will
prohibit
contracts
between
carriers
for
exchanges
of
service
if
the
fcc
enters
an
order
that
it's
in
the
public
interest.
so
under
this
procedure,
you
file
a
contract
with
the
fcc,
if
it
approves
then
you're
authorized...
the
carriers
are
authorized
to
swap
services
with
one
other
and
not
charge
each
other
filed
rates.
that's
true
of
each...
every
other
example
we
list.
in
each
of
those
other
provisions,
205,
210,
and
the
newly
enacted
332,
the
fcc
is
authorized
to
take
specific
action
that
will
have
the
effect
of
relieving
carriers
from
the
requirement
that
they
charge
only
filed
rates.
and
the
fact
that
congress
enacts
these
specific
exemptions
just
shows
that
the
modification
authority
isn't
as
broad.
and
if
you
want
contemporaneous
evidence
that
congress
didn't
understand
the
modification
authority
to
include
the
authority
to
exempt
people
from
the
rate-filing
requirements
whatsoever,
at
the
same
time
congress
enacted
the
communications
act,
or
the
year...
the
next
year
it
enacted
the
motor
carrier
act,
and
it
has
the
same
filing
requirements,
same
modification
provisions
applicable
both
to
motor
common
carriers,
that's
section
217
of
the
act,
and
motor
contract
carriers,
that's
218.
and
in
the
contract
carrier
provision,
it
has
the
rate-filing
requirement,
then
it
has
the
modification
provision,
then
after
that
there's
a
provision
that
says:
"the
icc
is
authorized
to
grant
relief
from
the
requirements
of
this
statute.
"
that
clearly
shows
that
congress
didn't
understand
the
modification
authority
reaches
as
broad
as
they
say,
because
it
enacted
a
specific
additional
provision
authorizing
them
to
grant
relief.
so
whatever
the
scope
of
modification--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--it
was
subject
to
the
restriction
the
icc
had
to
find
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest
and
consistent
with,
i
believe
it
said
national
transportation
policy.
so,
i
mean,
when
congress
wants
to
authorize
exemptions
from
the
statutory
rate-filing
requirements,
it
uses
different
language,
it
doesn't
say
"modify".
in
fact,
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that's
really
at
issue
here,
an
'85
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
goes
on...
at
pages
16
and...
through
18...
to
describe
all
sorts
of
statutes
where
there's
explicit
exceptions
to
the
rate-filing
requirements,
and
each
of
those
have
the
same
sort
of
modification
provisions
that
are
at
issue
here.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
1935.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
no,
that's
the
original
motor
carrier
act,
and
that
was
obviously
carried
through.
in
fact,
in
maislin
among
your
reasons
for
declining
to
allow
the
fcc
to
create
an
exception
to
the
rate-filing
requirements
under
the
unreasonable
practices
ban
is
the
fact
that
congress
had
adopted
explicit
exemptions
for
motor
contract
carriers.
and
that
was
also
at
issue
in
the
regular
common
carrier
decision
that
was
relied
on
in
maislin,
and
i
believe
judge...
then
judge
scalia
wrote
in
a
former
life.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
there's
no
doubt
that
the
existence
of
competition
is
an
extremely
significant
fact
in
this
regulatory
scheme.
as
we
have
said,
in
trying
to
get
deregulation
for
ourself,
it
justifies
modifications
of
the
rate-filing
requirements,
it
justifies
elimination
of
cost-support
requirements
with
the
filings,
it
eliminates...
it
justifies
eliminating
active
forms
of
cost-of-service
regulation,
shortening
the
notice
period
to
as
little
as
1
day.
so
it's
a
very
significant
fact,
but
the
statute
says
you
can
modify
in
particular
circumstances,
not
exempt,
and
all...
all
competition
allows
within...
under
203
is
the
sorts
of
streamlined
regulation
that
we
are
seeking
in
this
petition
that
we
filed
that
people
keep
misquoting.
so
competition
is
very
significant,
but
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
need
for
the
rate-filing
requirements
for
the
reasons
that
i
said
earlier,
because
you'll
have
price
differences
even
in
competitive
markets.
they're
not
anticompetitive,
but
they
are
price
differences
that
congress
sought
to
eliminate.
congress
wanted
equal
rates
for
similarly
situated
customers,
and
decided
the
way
to
achieve
that
is
making
everyone
file
rates
so
that
all
customers
would
know
what
they
were
and
could
demand
them.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
the
fcc
has
had
this
classification
for
a
number
of
years,
i
believe
it
dated
from
the
early
1980's,
and
they
define
dominant
carriers
as
carriers
possessing
market
power,
and
it
has
significance
for
tarrifying
requirements
and
for
other
provisions,
because
dominant
carriers
are
subject
to
some
fcc
regulations,
i
believe,
that
others--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--we,
i
don't
believe,
have
ever
argued
that
the
fcc
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
make
that
distinction
for
some
purposes.
our
point
here...
and
i...
our
point
here
is
only
that
whatever
the
significant
of
that
distinction
for
other
purposes,
you
can't
be...
it
can't
be
a
basis
to
exempt
carriers
from
what
the
statute
unambiguously
requires
that
all
do,
which
is
to
charge
only
filed
rates.
as
i've
said,
that
we
think
this
case,
even
if
you
were
to
disagree
with
us
that
the
statute
is
susceptible
to
the
fcc's
interpretation,
we
think
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
decision
in
maislin.
because
it
establishes,
as,
you
know,
many
prior
cases
had,
that
rate-filing
requirements
are
so
central
to
the
statutory
scheme
that
even
broad
and
facially
applicable
provisions
of
the
law,
like
the
ban
on
unreasonable
practices
at
issue
there,
can't
be
construed
to
authorize
exceptions
to
the
great
filing
requirement
unless
congress
has
explicitly
so
provided.
i
believe
today,
and
certainly
in
the
reply
belief,
that
mr.
verrilli
tried
to
distinguish
maislin
by
saying
that
it
didn't
involve
the
requirement
that
rates
be
filed,
but
only
a
requirement...
which
is
a
requirement
of
section
203(a)
of
the
statute...
that
involved
only
a
requirement
that
carriers
follow
whatever
tariffs
they've
filed
and
that
they
not
charge
rates
that
are
different
from
those
that
are
set
forth
in
the
tariff.
and
they
say
there's
a
fundamental
distinction
in
the
statute
between
the
two.
now,
even
if
that
were
true
it
wouldn't
do
these
petitioners
any
good,
because
they're
doing
exactly
what
they
say
what
maislin
said
they
couldn't
do,
they're
charging
lower
rates
than
those
set
forth
in
the
tariff.
that's
what
mci
did
in
the
underlying
litigation
that
led
to
this;
it
was
negotiating
discounts
of
5
to
10
percent
below
its
generally
applicable
tariff
rates.
and
the
fcc
and
mci
each
explain
in
their
brief
that
the
consequence
of
their
position
is
that
carriers
can
go
off
and
cut
secret
deals,
rebates,
all
the
things
that
203(c)
of
the
statute
prohibit.
so
even
if
there
were
the
distinction
that
they're
positing,
it
wouldn't
xx
them
any
good
here
because
this
order
allows
exactly
what
maislin
prohibits.
but
the
more
fundamental
point
is
that
there's
no
distinction
in
the
statute
between
merely
filing
rates,
which
they
say
is
a
203
obligation,
and
merely
following
tariffs,
which
they
say
is
the
203(c)
duty.
the
two
obligations
are
absolutely
parallel.
they're
just
different
ways
of
saying
the
same
thing;
they're
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin.
if
you
charge
a
customer
a
rate
that's
lower
than
that
set
forth
in
your
tariff
and
don't
file
the
lower
negotiated
rate,
you're
violating
both
section
203
and
20...
both
section
203(a)
and
section
203(c).
you're
violating
203(a)
because
you're
not
filing
all
your
charges.
you're
violating
203(c)
because
you're
charging
a
customer
a
rate
that's
not
filed.
the
two
obligations
are
parallel
and
they
overlap
and
there's
a
violation
of
each,
and
for
that
reason
maislin
relied
both
on
the
duty
to
file
and
on
the
duty
to
follow.
at
page
126
of
the
opinion,
497
u.s.
at
126,
the
court
said
that
the
negotiated
rates
policy
was
inconsistent
with
both,
quote,
the
duty
to
file
rates
with
the
commission,
citing
the
counterpart
to
203(a),
and
the
obligation
to
charge
only
those
rates,
citing
the
counterpart
to
203(c).
so
what
this
case
ultimately
boils
down
this...
and
this
is,
you
know,
really
more
in
the
reply
briefs
than
the
argument
today...
is
they're
arguing
that
you
shouldn't
follow
the
maislin
precedent
here
because
the
case
involves,
they
say,
a
different
industry
and
a
different
statute.
and
in
arguing
that,
they're
asking
you
to
overrule
another
line
of
cases
which
says
that
statutes
that
are
modeled
on
the
interstate
commerce
act
are
to
be
construed
the
same
way
unless
there's
material
differences.
that
principle
dates
back
at
least
to
the
1932
u.s.
navigation
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
and
it
was
the
basis
for
maislin.
because
in
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes,
he
did.
now,
that's
a
curious
citation,
because
permian
basin
didn't
involve
exceptions
to
rate-filing
requirements,
but
there
was
a
subsequent
followup
to
permian
basin
that
did,
and
that's
the
ftc
v.
texaco
case,
417
u.s.
380,
and
that
involved
the
kind
of
modifications
of
the
rate-filing
requirements
that
we
say
are
permissible,
that
involved
small
gas
producers
who
didn't
deal
with
ultimate
consumers
and
sold
their
output
exclusively
to
pipelines
whose
rates
were
regulated.
and
the
court
didn't
exempt
the
filing
of
those
rates.
it
allowed
the
large...
the
pipeline
with
whom
the
small
producers
sold
to
file
the
rates,
and
the
court
said
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
statute
if
it
were
the
case...
and
it
was
a
remand,
but
if
were
the
case
that
in
regulating
the
rates
of
the
large
producer,
it
could
be
assured
that
the
small
producers'
rates
were
just
and
reasonable.
no
issue
of
discrimination
there
because
it
dealt...
the
small
producers
dealt
only
with
the
pipelines.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
the
small
producers
did
not
file.
the
rates
were
filed
by
the
pipelines
that
each
sold
its
output
to
exclusively.
the
small
producers
didn't
deal
with
ultimate
consumers
at
all.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
think
if
you
could
ever
have
a
situation
like
that,
comparable
to
that
in
the
telecommunications
industry...
which
i
can't
imagine,
but
if
you
ever
could
it
would
okay
because
the
rates
would
be
on
file
and
the
commission
would
be
in
a
position
to
assure
that
the
rates
were
lawful.
so
i
don't
think...
and
the
texaco
case
that
they
cite
says
that
the
commission
cannot
exempt
carriers.
it
says
they
cannot
be
exempt,
carriers,
from
the
requirements
of
section
204,
which
is
where
the
rate-filing
requirement
lives.
so
it's
a
curious
citation.
so
i
think
their
position
ultimately
boils
down
to
an
argument
that
you
shouldn't
follow
the
interstate
commerce
act
precedents
because
this
case
involves
a
different
statute.
but
maislin
rejected
that,
because
there
the
court
applied
pre-1935
decisions
under
the
original
interstate
commerce
act,
which
applied
only
to
railroads,
and
they
applied
it
to
motor
carriers
who
were
operating
under
a
statute
which
to
them
was
a
successor
to
the
1935
motor
carrier
act.
and
in
this
situation,
the
interstate
commerce
act
precedents
absolutely
should
apply
because
the
statute
was...
the
provisions
we're
dealing
with
here,
sections
201
to
210,
were
copied
almost
verbatim
from
those
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
this
is
a
case
like
laurilar
v.
ponds
where
congress
exhibited,
you
know,
detailed
knowledge
of
the
provisions
of
another
statute,
copied
those
provisions
it
wanted
to
follow,
and
then
departed
from
other
provisions
it
didn't
want
to
follow.
sections
201
to
210
of
the
communications
act
were
copied
from
those
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
then
they
didn't
want
to
allow
the
fcc
to
preempt
state
regulation
in
the
ways
that
the
icc
had
been
allowed
to
do
under
an
earlier
precedent
of
this
court
that
was
at
issue
in
the
1986
louisiana
v.
fcc
case,
so
they
put
other
provisions
in
the
statute
to
make
sure
that
the
fcc
wouldn't
in
those
limited
respects
have
the
same
powers
the
icc
had
and
wouldn't
be
subject
to
the
same
restrictions.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yeah,
that's
our
acronym.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no,
i
do
contest
that.
in
the
first
place,
there...
it's
argued
that
that
was
assuming
an
fcc
rule
was
valid,
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
here,
it
wasn't
until
1992
that
the
fcc
even
said
that
this...
that
it
had
adopted
a
rule
that
it
relieved
carriers
from
the
rate-filing
requirement.
and
the
only
interpretations
of
xx
statute
that
were
in
existence
in
the
time...
at
the
time
that
was
enacted
was
the
1985
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit
which
says
that
carriers
couldn't
be
exempted.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
the
legislation--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--the
legislation
made
absolute
sense.
the
problem
the
statute
addressed...
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
rates
were
filed
or
not.
the
problem
was
that
a
new
sort
of
cottage
industry
had
arose
which
involved
both
entities
that
weren't
common
carriers
and
weren't
subject
to
the
filing
requirement
and
entities
like
at&t...
in
theory
like
at&t
and
mci,
that
were.
and
what
congress
did
in
that
statute
was
it
made
everybody
who
provided
operator
services...
including
those
who
weren't
carriers
and
weren't
subject
to
the
statute,
made
everybody
file
information.
some
of
it
was
information
required
by
203,
rates,
and
some
of
it
was
other
information
that
wasn't
required
by
203--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--oh,
absolutely,
absolutely.
it
imposed
additional
obligations.
it
imposed
obligations
on
carriers
because
it
made
them
file
information
that
wasn't
required
by
203,
i.e.
commissions,
and
it
imposed
obligations
on
noncarriers
who
weren't
subject
to
any
requirement
at
all.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
and
the
problem
that
led
to
the
statute
wasn't
that
the
fcc
wasn't
receiving
rate
filings.
the
problem
was
the
fcc
wasn't
doing
anything
at
all
to
combat
something
that
had
become
a
massive
problem,
which
was
the
sort
of
new
fly-by-night
companies
cutting
deals
with
hotels
and
ending
up
charging
people
rates
that
were
two
or
three
times
those
that
at&t
and
mci
charged.
so
that's
what
that
statute
addressed,
and
the
statute
explicitly
said
that
nothing
in
it
could
be
construed
as
altering
the
obligations
of
any
provision
in
the
statute.
and
given
that
at
the
time
203
was
construed--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--thank
you.
