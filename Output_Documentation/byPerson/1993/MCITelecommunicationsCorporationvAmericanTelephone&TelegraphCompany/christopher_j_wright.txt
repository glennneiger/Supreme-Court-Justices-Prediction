mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
section
203(a)
of
the
communications
act,
telephone
companies
are
required
to
file
tariffs.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
communications
commission
has
authority
to
relieve
nondominant
long
distance
companies
of
the
requirement
that
they
file
tariffs.
in
our
view,
that
question
is
answered
by
section
203(b)(2)
of
the
act,
which
provides
that
the
commission
may
modify
any
requirement
of
section
203.
since
the
commission
may
modify
any
requirement
of
section
203,
it
may
modify
the
tariff
filing
requirement
established
by
section
203(a).
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
the
position
that
the
fcc
has
taken,
and,
of
course,
the
d.c.
circuit
struck
that
down.
now,
we
believe
that
"modify
any
requirement"
would
mean
that.
let
me
point
out,
in
response
to
your
question,
that
the
fcc
has
not
gone
nearly
that
far.
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
that's
certainly
all
we're
arguing
about
today.
now,
i
guess
i'd
interpreted
justice
souter's
question
as
sort
of
assuming
that
at&t
would
become
nondominant
at
some
point
in
the
future.
i
don't
know
any
rationale
for
eliminating
the
tariff
filing
requirement
for
a
dominant
carrier
like
at&t.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
that's
exactly
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
the
commission
has
the
authority.
under
our
broadest
reading
of
the
statute,
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
modify
any
requirement.
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
reasonable
to
relieve
dominant
carriers
of
the
authority.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
don't...
i...
the
commission
hasn't
taken
any
view
on
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
right
now
the
commission
has
not
articulated
any
reason
for
relieving
dominant
carriers
of
such
a
requirement,
but--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--our
reading
of
the
statute,
"modify
any
requirement",
yes,
would
allow
the
commission,
for
appropriate
reasons,
to
relieve
all
carriers
of
the
tariff
filing
requirement.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
and
when
it
happens
that
the
industry
is
fully
competitive,
then
we
believe
congress
has
authorized
the
commission
to
do
away
with
a
tool
to
enforce
just
and
reasonable
rates
that
would
no
longer
have
a
purpose.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
unreasonably
discriminatory,
as
construed
by
the
commission,
includes...
i'm
sorry,
competition
assumes
that
there'll
be
give-and-take
of
negotiation,
and
that...
the
fact
that
different
rates
get
determined
does
not
necessarily
show
that
something's
unreasonably
discriminatory.
i'd
like
to
rely
on
at&t's
submission
to
the
commission
to
answer
your
question,
though.
i
mean,
they
said
that
by
definition,
nondominant
carriers
lack
sufficient
market
power
to
be
able
to
engage
in
improper
price
discrimination
without
suffering
the
discipline
of
the
marketplace.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
in
this
particular
instance,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
also
wanted
to
make
the
point,
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question,
that
so
far
all
the
commission
has
done
is
relieve
part
of
one
of
three
markets
of
the
tariff
filing
requirement.
it
has
not
been
lifted
for
international
calls.
it
has
not
been
lifted,
by
and
large,
for
the
local
exchange
carriers,
which
do
99
percent
of
the
interstate
access
service.
it's
only
been
lifted
for
40
percent
of
the
long
distance
market
not
served
by
at&t,
and
with
respect
to
that
40
percent,
nondominant
carriers
like
mci
frequently
choose
to
file
tariffs,
especially
with
respect
to
residential
customer
services.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
for...
and
for
carriers
who
choose
to...
choose
to
file
tariffs,
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
it's
not
mandatory
for
the
nondominant
carriers.
at&t
reads
the
statute
differently.
it
says
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
any
requirement.
specifically,
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
tariff
filing
requirement,
because
that's
a
core
requirement
of
the
act.
in
at&t's
view,
the
statute
only
allows
the
fcc
to
modify
formalities.
we
have
two
responses.
first,
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
core
requirements
or
formalities.
and,
in
fact,
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
such
a
rule
would
be
needed
for
formalities.
section
203(a)
says
very
little
about
formalities,
and
what
it
does
say
is
the
following:
"tariffs
shall
contain
such
other
information
and
be
printed
in
such
form
and
be
posted
and
kept
open
for
public
inspection
in
such
places
as
the
commission
may
by
regulation
require.
"
so
there's
another
provision
that
gives
the...
another
provision
in
section
203
that
gives
the
commission
authority
over...
over
those
formalities.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
there's
a
1980
order
of
the
commission
that
in
the
text
says
something
that
sounds
like
that,
and
in
the
accompanying
footnote
says,
but,
of
course,
section
203
is
very
broad.
and
the
issue
in
that
case
was
not
whether
or
not...
you
know,
that
was
dicta
in
that
case.
both
of
those
contradictory
statements
were
dicta
in
that
case.
since
1980,
the
commission
has
been
firmly
of
the
view
that
it
has
authority
to
lift
this
requirement.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
your
honor.
no,
it
was
a
different
matter.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
yes,
we
define
it
in
light
of
webster's
ninth
new
collegiate
dictionary.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and
i
would
concede
even
that
one
of
"modify"
's
meanings
would
even
be
more
limited
than
that.
in
some
cases
it
would
only
mean
circumscribed
alterations.
but
there
are
different--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
justice
scalia,
webster's
collegiate
dictionary
very
clearly...
the
fcc's
construction
fits
within
its
definition.
and
this
is
not
an
obscure
dictionary;
this
is
one
this
court's
relied
on.
this
court's
favorite
dictionary
is
webster's
third
new
world
dictionary.
you've
relied
on
it
as
recently
as
january,
you
relied
on
it
9
or
10
times
last
term,
and
it
includes
a
definition
"to
make
a
basic
or
important
change
in.
"
so--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
is
one
of
the
definitions--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
at&t
has
not
actually
said
this.
it
suggested
that
perhaps
1934,
but
actually
the
definitions
that
they
cite
from
the
thirties
all
say
"alter".
now
we'd
be
happy
if
you
want...
if
this
means
fcc
has
authority
to
alter
any
provision.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
on
a
practical
level,
it's
occurred
to
me
that
before
i
went
to
law
school
i
thought
edit
meant,
you
know,
change
a
few
tenses.
then
after
seeing
what
a
law
review
would
do
to
something
i
wrote,
i
realized
that
it
means
rewrite.
now,
if
somebody
on
a
law
review
told
me
they
were
going
to
modify
rather
than
edit
what
i
was
submitting,
i'd
really
be
scared
about
what
was
happening.
[laughter]
let
me
also
say
that
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
amtrak
case,
the
case
decided
2
years
ago,
national
passenger
railroad
v.
boston
&
maine.
the
issue
in
that
case
was
what
the
word
"required"
meant.
the
d.c.
circuit
had
said
that
it
had
to
mean
necessary,
that
"required"
meant
necessary,
that's
the
first
definition.
the
icc
had
said,
no,
we're
going
to
interpret
it
just
to
mean
useful
in
this
context;
we're
going
to
give
it
what
was
effectively
a
broader
meaning.
this
court
said
that
few
phrases
in
a
complex
scheme
of
regulation
are
so
clear
as
to
be
beyond
the
need
for
interpretation
when
implied
in
a
real
context,
and
went
on
to
say
that
the
existence
of
alternative
dictionary
definitions
of
the
word
"required",
each
making
some
sense
under
the
statute,
itself
indicates
that
the
statute
is
open
to
interpretation.
in
this
case,
you
can
put
"modify"
in
place
of
"required"
and
reach
the
exact
same
conclusion.
let
me
add
in
that
respect
that
at&t
has
cited
the...
even
though
we
devoted
a
few
pages
of
our
brief
to
it,
has
cited
that
case
only
in
a
footnote
where
they
say
that
the
reason
it's
distinguishable
is
because
our
definition
of
the
statute
makes
no
sense
at
all.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
one
of...
it
says
"in
its
discretion
and
for
good
cause
shown,
modify
any
requirement
either
in
particular
instances
or
by
general
order
applicable
to
special
circumstances--
"
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
we
think
looking
at
the
situation
today
from
what
congress
saw
in
1934,
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
fact
that
at&t
no
longer
holds
a
monopoly
over
long
distance
service,
but
that
there
are
481
other
nondominant
carriers--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
it's
not
yet...
i
mean,
as
i've
said,
it's
only
applicable
to
one
part
of
one
of
three
markets
here.
the
fact
that
there's
competition
there
has
not
gotten--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no...
well,
that's
another...
we
would
think
that
the
commission
has
authority
to
define
what
1934,
that...
when
there
was
really
no
competition
at
all,
that
today's
telecommunications
world
is
very
different.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if,
in
fact--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if,
in
fact,
the
communications
industry
has
changed
that
dramatically.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
wouldn't
phrase
it
that
way,
but--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--but,
look
it,
in
this...
in
203
there
are...
there
are
seven
sentences.
one
of
them
is
203(b).
five
of
the
others
contain
a
direction
that
carriers
shall
do
something.
the
verb
"shall"
is
used
in
five
of
those
sentences.
the
commission
has
said
that...
is
told
that
it
may
modify
any
of
those
requirements.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
commission
may
change
the
rules,
that
that's
what
congress
has
authorized
it
to
do.
and,
in
fact,
i
don't
think
i
quite
made
the
point
that
how
little
at&t's
view
allows
the
commission
to
do
under
"modify
any
requirement".
as
i
say,
all
it
says
is
that
we
may
modify
formalities,
and
we
already
have
authority
to
modify
most
of
the
formalities.
they...
congress
expressly
delegated
that
to
the
commission
as
well.
at&t
reads
this
to
modify
some
requirements.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
the
logic
of
at&t's
position
may
be
that
we
can
go
as
far
as
we've
gone
and
detariff
part
of
one
of
three
markets
and
not
go
as
far
as
to
detariff
it
if
that
becomes
appropriate,
but
i
don't
really
think
that
they've
made
that
argument.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
believe
so.
certainly
the
amtrak
case
that
i
just
cited
was
an
icc
case,
and,
if
anything,
it
would
seem
that
more
deference
would
be
appropriate,
but
i'm
not
asking
for
any
more,
just
the
same
amount.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i'll
stand
on
the
amtrak
case
and
the
fact
that
that
case
is
almost
exactly
like
this
one.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
at&t's
comments
about
maislin
and
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
it
is
true,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
that
that's
a
different
issue
arising
under
a
different
statute.
i'd
also
like
to
suggest
that
it's
instructive
to
consider
what...
how...
what
would
happen
if
the
communications
act
said
that
the
fcc
may
modify
any
requirement,
including
the
tariff-filing
requirement.
if
the
statute
said
that,
i
think
there'd
be
no
doubt...
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
it
would
be
clear
that
we
could
modify
the
tariff-filing
requirement
if
the
statute
said
modify
any
requirement,
including
the
tariff-filing
requirement.
now,
in
this
hypothetical
statute,
in
that
circumstance
what
had
been
said
in
a
different
context
arising
under
a
different
statute
wouldn't
matter.
in
fact,
that
phrase
including
the
tariff-filing
requirement
would
be
redundant.
the
statute
says
"modify
any
requirement",
and
it
would
be
a
peculiar
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
required
congress
to
be
redundant.
now,
one
thing
that's
clearly
come
out--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
i
was
going
to
say
one
thing
that's
come
out
is
that
at&t
clearly
thinks
that
under
no
circumstances
at
all
can
the
fcc
lift
the
tariff-filing
requirement.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
the
first
requirement
is
that
they
shall
be
filed,
and
at&t
says
that
we...
that
the
fcc
doesn't
have
that
authority.
we
think
that
it's
clear
that
it
therefore
reads
203(b)(2)
to
say
modify
some
requirements,
not
any
requirement,
and
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
one
final
point,
if
i
may.
you
know,
the...
it's
been
suggested
that
congress
would...
couldn't
imagine
a
detariffed
world.
well,
just
last
summer
with
respect
to
commercial
mobile
carriers
like
cellular
carriers
in
section
332(c),
congress
authorized...
what
congress
did
was
say
that
these
cellular
companies
are
generally
subject
to
the
title
ii
requirements
we've
been
discussing
today,
but
it
said
that
the
commission
may
waive
any
requirement,
including
the
tariff-filing
requirement,
except
for
three
that
it
specified:
201,
202,
and
208.
202
is
the
one
that
prohibits
unreasonable
discrimination.
so
congress,
as
shown
last
year
in
its
enactment
concerning
cellular
telephones,
clearly
envisions
that
unreasonable
discrimination
may
be
prohibited
without
tariffs.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
do
not
know
that,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
as
i've
also
already
pointed
out,
there's
really
no
answer
to
the
fact
that
the
amtrak
case...
under
the
amtrak
case
in
the...
with
different
dictionary
definitions...
and
i've
been
informed
that
in
apf
freight,
the
nlrb,
this
term
the
court
has
applied
chevron
to
an
independent
agency.
the
fcc
ought
to
have
discretion
to
reasonably
interpret
"modify
any
requirement"
to
mean
what
it
says.
thank
you.
