justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
we
held,
mr.
wright,
that
chevron
deference
is
equally
applicable
to
an
independent
commission
as
is
to
an
agency
of
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
more
deference
is
due
to
a
body
that
is
not
controlled
by
elected
representatives
directly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
fcc
have
a
developed
body
of
law
to
define
what
is
a
dominant
participant
in
an
industry,
or
is
this
a
category...
a
juridical
category
that
is
new
for
this
regulation
only?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
support
in
the
statute
for
that
category
in
these
areas
where
the
fcc
has
been
applying
it?
