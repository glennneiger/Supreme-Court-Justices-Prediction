justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
there
a
significant
difference
between
the
use
that
california
makes
of
the
factors
and
the
use
that
we
have...
the
uses
that
we
have
been
concerned
with
in
past
cases
when
we
have
said
that
in
weighing
states,
the
vagueness
of
the
factors
infects
the
weighing
process.
and
isn't...
in
our
prior
cases,
wasn't
our
rationale
that
the
fact
that
the
state
had
identified
a
certain
kind
of
propositional
aggravating
circumstance,
like
it
was
cruel,
there
was
torture
in
the
commission
and
so
on...
the
fact
that
the
state
has
weighed...
has
identified
a
statement
like
that,
when
found
to
be
true
as
an
aggravating
factor,
and
that
statement
is
also
vague
so
that,
in
fact,
it's
kind
of
a
wild
card,
we
really
never
can
tell
whether
it's
really
true
or
not,
it
is
the
use
of
that
factor
which
the
state
has
given
emphasis
to
by
its
identification
in
the
narrowing
stage
which
is
what
skews
the
weighing
process.
but
here
the
aggravating
factors
that
are
being
used
at
the
weighing
stage
are
not
the
aggravating
factors
which
have
been
used
at
the
narrowing
stage.
it's
an
entirely
different
set
of
propositions.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
point
in
stringer
was...
there
was
no
problem
at
the...
by
the
use
of
an
aggravate...
of
a
vague
aggravator
at
the
narrowing
stage
because
you
had
a
nongrave...
nonvague
aggravator,
that's
all.
the
problem
in
stringer,
as
i
recall
it,
was
that
by
using
an
aggravator
which
the
state
had
identified
as
being
especially
important
despite
its
vagueness,
that
skewed
the
weighing
process.
here
you're
not
using
the
same
aggravator
to
weigh
that
you
did
to
narrow,
and
you're
not
using
an
aggravator
which
states
a
proposition
like
"it
was
cruel".
instead,
you're
using
an
aggravator
that
simply
looks
to
subject
matter,
and
aren't
those
the
two
distinguishing
factors
between
this
case
and
stringer?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
we
identify
a
subject
matter
which
it
is
relevant
for
them
to
consider,
and
that
is
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
jury
in
a
state
like
georgia,
which
does
not
go
through
a
formal
weighing
process,
can
do.
once
the
narrowing
is
done
in
georgia,
the
jury
in
effect
can
consider
everything
it
knows
in
deciding
whether
or
not,
at
the
penalty
phase,
to
impose
that
penalty.
and
what
california,
it
seems
to
me,
is
doing
is
to
say
you
may
consider
the
following
subjects:
age,
circumstances,
and
so
on.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
accept
your
argument,
then
schemes
like
georgia
are
going
to
be
unconstitutional
too,
which
i
think
is
the
implication
of
justice
scalia's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wouldn't
it
be
more
precise
to
say
that
if
they
are
going
to
identify
certain
subject
matters
which
ought
to
be
considered
at
the
weighing
stage,
they
at
least
ought
to
be
relevant
subject
matters.
do
you
claim
that
there
is
anything
irrelevant,
as
a
matter
of
theory,
to
the
sentencing
decision
in
the
subject
matters
that
have
been
identified
by
california
at
the
weighing
stage?
is
age
irrelevant?
are
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
irrelevant?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
it's...
with
respect,
isn't
this...
isn't
the
instruction
to
the
jury
basically,
consider
this
subject
matter.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
they
are
told
to
look
at
it
in
the
sense
that
it
is
obviously
relevant
to
the
decision
that
they
are
coming
to.
i
don't
see
what
you
mean
by
a
lens.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be,
it
may
not
be.
i
mean
they...
i
don't
know
how
they
view
age.
they
view
age
as...
the
age
of
19
at
the
commission
of
crime
as
aggravating
or
as
mitigating.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
identification
of
that
subject
as
something
to
be
considered
or
in
the
instructions
given
here
that
make
it
aggravating
or
mitigating.
in
fact,
one
of
the
arguments
is
that
you
can't
tell
from
the
instructions
whether
you're
supposed
to
treat
it
as
aggravating
or
mitigating.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
the
state
is
doing
is
saying
consider
this
for
what
it's
worth.
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-hum.
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-hum.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
was
the
case
in
stringer.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
and
what
was
wrong
with
it
is
that
it
gave
the
illusion
that
you
were
stating
a
proposition
about
that
case
which
was
capable
of
being
shown
to
be
true
or
false,
and
because
of
the
vagueness
of
the
statement
that
really
wasn't
true.
but
here
you're
not
presenting
the
jury
with
a
statement
which
they
can
find
or
not
find,
as
the
case
may
be,
apparently
true
or
false
or
provable
true
or
false.
you're
simply
saying
to
the
jury
consider
the
circumstances.
you
can
answer
that
after
lunch,
mr.
gillingham.
we'll
stand
in
recess.
we'll
resume
the
arguments
in
tuilaepa.
mr.
gillingham.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
had...
it's
clear
that
they
had
to
weigh
the
subjects
which
the
so-called
factors
referred
to,
no
question
about
that,
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
factors
were
different
from
the
kinds
of
factors
which
are
expressed
in
just
propositions
of
fact
like
it
was
cruel?
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
much
more
vague
in
the
sense
that
they,
generally
speaking
at
least,
do
not
state
propositions
which
the
jury
has
to
find
in
order
to
address
those
subjects.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the...
if
the...
let's
take
the
age
factor.
as
it
stands
now,
the
california
scheme
says
you
may
or
should
consider
the
age
of
the
defendant
in
the
process
of
doing
your
weighing.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
tell
you
whether
that
age
should
be
regarded
as
mitigating
or
as
aggravating.
it
might
have
said
you
may
determine
whether
the
defendant
was
at
an
age
of
youthful
indiscretion,
or
you
should
determine
whether
the
defendant
was
at
an
age
of
youthful
indiscretion.
that,
in
effect,
in
the
latter
case
would
have
required
the
jury
to
make
what
seemed
like,
at
least,
a
finding
of
fact;
he
was
young
and
indiscreet
or
he
wasn't
young
and
indiscreet.
the
prior
cases
that
we've
had,
like
the
stringer
cases,
have
involved
aggravating
factors
of
the...
what
i've
called
the
proposition
kind
of
aggravating
factors;
he
was
young
and
indiscreet.
california
just
says
you
should
consider
age,
for
whatever
it's
worth.
it
may
be
aggravating,
it
may
be
mitigating,
so
far
as
the
california
statute
is
concerned,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
distinction
from
the
stringer
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
argued
mitigating
too.
i
mean,
the
defendant
can
get
up
and
say,
okay,
consider
his
age,
whatever
it
was,
19.
that's
a
mitigating
factor,
because
he
was
young
and
he's
going
to
get
older
and
wiser
as
he
gets
older.
each
side
could
argue
the
mitigating
or
aggravating
affect
as
that
side
saw
fit.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
(k)?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
if
they
consider
the
subjects
of
everything
up
to
(k)
as
a
practical
matter,
they're
going
to
be
considering
aggravating
factors.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what
then...
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
does
the
list
from
(a)
through
(j)
pretty
much
exhaust
the
possibility...
the
field
of
relevant
considerations
except
for
mitigation?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
they
single
anything
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
in
the
list
of
factors--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
jury
really
considers
all
of
those
factors,
(a)
through
(j).
justice
david
h.
souter
will
it
have
considered
pretty
much
the
universe
of
possibly
aggravating
factors?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it
considers
all
of
them,
will
it
pretty
much
have
canvassed
the
possible
scope
of
relevant
aggravating
factors?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
says
that,
in
effect,
everything
else
is
special
too,
then,
in
effect,
nothing
is
special.
that's
why
i
was
asking
you
whether
these
various
aggravating
factors
pretty
much
cover
the
whole
scope
of
possible
aggravation.
and
if
they
do,
then
i
think
it's
hard
to
say
that
california
is
singling
something
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
maybe...
in
fact,
i'm
assuming
something
that
you
did
not,
yourself,
argue.
i
was
assuming
the
argument
that
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
other
petitioner
here
that
as
a
practical
matter
everything,
what,
through
(1)
or
(j)
or
whatnot
are
patently
aggravating
factors,
and
then
there's
sort
of
a
catchall
at
the
end,
consider
any
mitigating
factors.
and
if...
i
guess
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
by
my
question
was
what
if
california,
in
effect,
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
we're
not
talking
about
mitigation
or
aggravation,
we're
just
talking
about
relevance;
you
should
consider
the
following
subject
matters,
factors,
whatever
they
might
call
them,
as
being
relevant
when
you
go
through
the
weighing
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that's
what
georgia
does.
justice
david
h.
souter
georgia
says
you're
supposed
to
weigh
all...
in
effect,
all
the
evidence
that
you
deem
to
be
relevant.
and
on
my
hypo,
california
would
be
saying
the
same
thing,
except
that
california
would
identify
the
particular
subjects
of
that
relevant
evidence
which
pretty
much
canvass
the
universe
of
relevance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
the
only
rational
way
they
could
possibly
behave?
i
mean,
it's
assumed
that
juries
are
not
going
to
say
we
find
the
mitigating
evidence
overwhelming
here,
but
we
think
we'll
impose
the
death
penalty
anyway.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
believe
the
argument
that
you
just
made
is
true,
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
way
age
is
treated
under
the
california
scheme?
i
mean
the
california
factor
simply,
in
effect,
says
consider
the
age
of
the
defendant.
now,
some
jurors
may
consider
it
mitigating,
some
may
consider
it
aggravating
in
a
given
case,
but
how
would
it
be
true...
how...
under
what
circumstances
do
you
think
it
would
be
true
that
they
would
come
to
their
disparate
conclusions
based
on
the
way
the
factor
was
treated
by
the
statute
as
opposed
to
their
view
of
the
facts?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
my
question,
though,
i
think
stands.
doesn't...
how
can
you
say
that
that
is
a
result
of
the
way
the
california
statute
is
written
or
the
way
the
factors
are
described
for
the
jury,
as
distinct
from
the
way
the
jury,
and
before
them
counsel
in
the
case,
view
the
facts?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
and
that
may
be...
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off
from
that.
but
i...
so
far
as
facts
are
concerned,
you
really
can't
say,
can
you,
that
the
articulation
of
the
so-called
age
factor,
as
distinct
from
the
way
the
jury
views
age
in
a
given
case,
is
going
to
tip
the
jury's
view
of
age
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
with
me.
[laughter]
