we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
93-5131,
paul
palalaua
tuilaepa
v.
california
and
proctor
against
california.
mr.
gillingham.
we'll
run
until
noon,
mr.
gillingham,
and
then
resume
at
1:00.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
agree
that
california
could
have
dispensed
entirely
with
the
list
of
factors,
since
it
narrows
it
in
a
different
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gillingham,
your
comment
about
age
being
only
an
aggravating
factor,
or
at
least
not
being
a
good
mitigating
factor,
certainly
would
contradict
a
couple
of
our
cases
where
we've
said
that...
like
edmunds,
where
the
court
has
said
that
the
jury
has
to
be
permitted
to
consider
age
as
a
mitigating
factor
in
the
sense
of
youth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly...
nothing
prevents
you,
as
i
gather
you
say
you've
done
unsuccessfully...
from
arguing
to
the
jury
that
a
person
of
say
19
years
old
or
18
years
old
should
be
considered
in
mitigation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gillingham.
mrs.
lascher,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
is
the...
how
is
it
argued
as
an
aggravating
factor
against
the
defendant,
ms.
lascher,
the
age?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
mean,
would
that...
would
the
prosecutor
highlight
that
fact
if
the
defendant
were,
say,
17?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
defense
attorneys
argue
contra,
that
it's...
that's
a
sufficiently
tender
age
or
young
age
to
be
mitigating.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
60
or
say
65?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
lascher.
mr.
prahl,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
prahl,
going
back
to
factor
(e)
for
a
moment...
i
take
it
these
are
supposed
to
state
things
that
might
be
expected
to
occur
in
more
than
one
case.
what
would
be
a
prototypical
example
of
a
case
where
the
victim
was
a
participant
in
the
defendant's
homicidal
conduct
or
consented
to
the
homicidal
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
prahl.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
petitioners
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
think
there's
a
question,
answer
it,
but
otherwise
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
gillingham.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
then
the
case
is
submitted.
thank
you.
