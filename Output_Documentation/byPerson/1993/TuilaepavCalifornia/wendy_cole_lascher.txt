ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
subject
of
the
process
the
jury
in
california
is
directed
to
go
through,
because
i
think
the
process
that
is
involved
in
these
cases
may
answer
some
of
justice
souter's
concerns.
the
jury
is
told
that
it
must
weigh
11
enumerated
factors.
and,
indeed,
in
mr.
proctor's
case
it
was
told
that
the
result
of
its
weighing
process
would
produce
a
mandatory
result.
and
so
the
very
nature
of
the
numerating
factors
leads
us
into
the
constitutional
difficulty
that
existed
both
in
the
tuilaepa
case
and
even
more
so
in
the
proctor
case,
because
now
you're
not
merely
telling
the
jury
to
look
at
the
wealth
of
evidence
it's
already
heard
and
make
a
determination
about
that
and
see
if
anything
mitigating
outweighs
it,
which
is
what
you
would
have
in
a
georgia
scheme.
but
you're
telling
the
jury
to
put
the
factor...
factors...
as
it
were,
the
evidence
into
little
boxes
and
to
look
at
each
one
separately
and
to
give
independent
weight
to
each
of
those
boxes,
however
much
or
little
weight
the
jury
chooses,
but
still
to
give
them
weight,
put
them
on
the
balance.
and
so
the
jury
has
to
go
through
a
tangible
process.
we
know
that
happened
in
the
proctor
case
because
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
it
was
going
to
do
that,
the
defense
lawyer
told
the
jury
it
was
going
to
do
that.
the
judge
not
only
instructed
the
jury
orally
to
do
that,
but
it
said
to
the
jury,
here
are
the
written
instructions;
you
may
take
them
into
the
jury
room
and
you
may
read
along
with
me
as
i
go
through
these
factors.
and
the
california
supreme
court
itself,
at
joint
appendix
152,
said
that
the
jury
would
have
understood
they
were
required
to
determine
the
penalty
by
weighing
the
enumerated
factors.
and
at
page
1...
page
77
of
the
record,
a
very
interesting
jury
instruction,
when
the
judge
does
read
the
factors
to
the
jury,
he
says,
first:
"in
determining
which
penalty
is
to
be
imposed
on
the
defendant
you
shall
consider
all
of
the
evidence
which
has
been
received
during
any
part
of
the
trial
of
this
case.
"
and
then
a
new...
and
then
there's
a
little
more
in
that
sentence
on
exception.
then
he
goes
on
to
a
second
sentence:
"you
shall
consider,
take
into
account,
and
be
guided
by
the
following
factors,
if
applicable.
"
so
the
jury
is
led
into
a
formula
it
almost
has
to
follow.
it's
not
a
precise
mathematical
formula,
but
it
is
required
to
go
through
these
steps,
and
that's
why
vagueness
in
any
factor
brings
this
case
squarely
within
not
only
stringer,
but
the
whole
line
of
cases
that
brought
us
to
this--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--your
honor,
i
believe
i
would...
it
would
depend
on
the
specific
case,
but
i
think
i
would
choose--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--all
right,
the
proctor
case.
i
think
i
would
choose
georgia,
and
this
is
why.
in
georgia
where
the
jury
is
not
given
any
kind
of
direction
except
that
it's
given
mitigating
evidence
to
weigh,
when
the
jury
goes
into
the
jury
room
there's
a
collective
process.
that's
what
we
count
on,
that's
why
we
have
all
this
litigation
about
jury
instructions
in
death
penalty
cases.
the
jurors
have
to
negotiate
with
each
other,
they
have
to
look
one
another
in
the
eye,
they
have
to
decide,
okay,
now
we're
really
at
the
crunch,
what
are
we
going
to
do,
is
this
murder
a
serious
enough
one
to
impose
a
death
penalty
and
not
another.
if
you
give
the
jury
a
list
of
factors
or
any
other
kind
of
instructions
that
guide
them
through
a
process,
you're,
in
effect,
giving
them
a
yardstick,
and
giving
them
a
yardstick
gives
them
a
sense
of
confidence.
we
sort
of...
the
court
sort
of
heard
about
that
in
the
mentally
ill
defendant
this
morning.
but
if
you
give
them
a
rubber
yardstick,
which
is
what
you
do
in
california
when
you
use
factors
that
are
of
such
vague
content,
then
you're
giving
them
a
very
false
sense
of
confidence.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
under
the...
i
prefer
that
to
a
system
which
gives
vague
guidance
to
the
jury,
which
gives
illusory
guidance
to
the
jury,
which
gives
really
misguidance
rather
than
simply
nonguidance,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
well,
your
honor,
that's,
in
effect,
what
the
california
jury
instructions
do,
just
as--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--i
think
the
key
to
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
the
phrase
"the
weighing
process".
i
think
as
soon
as
you
direct
the
jury
to
do
something
with
those
subject
matters
or
factors
or
whatever
you
call
them,
that's
where
you'll
get
into
trouble.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
if
you
say
consider--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--well,
actually,
i
disagree
somewhat
because
what
georgia
does
is
it
says
you
shall
weigh
these
subject
matters,
but
it
doesn't
say
the
thing
that
california
says,
which
is
if
you
find
that
aggravating
outweigh
mitigating,
that
you
shall
impose
the
death
penalty.
and
what
happened--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--no,
i
think
the
jury
can
decide
in
georgia
for
whatever
reason,
because
it
is
exercising
this
negotiating
function,
this
conscience
function,
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty
because
at
the
end
of
the
process
there's
no
consequence
attached
to
the
weighing.
now,
what
juries
will,
in
fact,
do
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
your
honor
may
be
right,
and
there
may
be
many
cases
where
they
will
come
to
the
end
of
the
process
and
they'll
say
well,
of
course,
this
leads
us,
on
our
own,
to
the
conclusion
that
there
should
be
a
death
penalty.
but
then
the
decision
is
the
jury's
and
the
decision
is
in
no
way
infected
by
the
jury
instructions.
and
where
california
goes
astray
is
in
the--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--where
california
goes
astray
is
in
guiding
the
jury
to
that
result.
it's
as
if
we
ask
the
jury
to
paint
a
landscape
and
we
give
them
canvas
and
paints,
that's
one
situation,
and
the
jury
can
go
in
and
they
can
decide
how
big
the
trees
should
be
and
whether
they
should
have
leaves
or
not,
and
that
kind
of
thing.
what
the
court
in
california
does
is
to
give
the
jury
essentially
a
paint-by-number
kit
so
that
it's
sort
of
determining
how
the
landscape
is
going
to
look
at
the
conclusion
of
the
process.
and
it
will
feed...
what
happens
in
a
system
like
california...
justice
rehnquist
asked
a
question
earlier
that
i
thought
was
very
descriptive
of
the
problem
we
have.
it
lists
a
number
of
factors,
it
tells
the
jury
to
treat
them
as
aggravating
or
mitigating,
it
allows
the
jury
to
treat
them
any
way
they
want.
because
at
least
six
of
those
factors
are
introduced
by
the
phrase
"whether
or
not",
so
the
jury
has
no
guidance
whatsoever
and
can
treat
factors
in
some
cases
as
aggravating
and
in
other
cases
as
mitigating,
even
though
the
evidence
in
the
two
cases
is
exactly
the
same.
it
allows
the
prosecutor
to
argue,
as
he
did
here--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--the
jury
has--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--it's
an
unfortunate
combination
of
both,
your
honor.
it
has
guidance
into
a
process,
and
then
being
told
it
has
to
follow
this
process,
it's
free
to
do
anything
it
wants.
and
the
danger
of
it,
and
the
reason
it's
a
bad--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--oh,
but
the
difference
is
in
georgia
the
free
jury
has
no
false
confidence
that
it's
the
law
directing
them
to
a
particular
result
by
following
a
formula.
in
california,
the
court
says
we're
going
to
give
you
a
formula,
here
are
the
11
factors,
weigh
them
against
one
another,
and
then
the
jury
has
a
sense,
gee,
we've
got
factors,
you
know,
we
can
be
comfortable
in
the
decision
we
make,
when,
in
fact--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--well,
you
know,
here's--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--could
happen.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
well
let
me...
oh,
no.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
i
don't
know
if
i
should
say
thank
you
for
saying
i'm
making
an
amazing
argument,
but
let's
go
back
to...
let's
go
all
the
way
back
to
furman
and
see
what
we're
trying
to
do
here.
what
we're...
furman's
basic
notion
was
to
avoid
arbitrary
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
for
purposes
of
this
case,
your
honor,
we
both
assume
that
the
special
circumstances
perform
the
narrowing
function.
now,
we're
one
step
beyond--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--well,
there
are
29
categories
of
murders
covered
by
the
special
circumstances,
that
california
voters--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--i'm
not
assuming
it.
i'm
assuming
it
for
purposes
of
the
issue
that
the
court
granted
certiorari
on.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
that's
right,
not--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--i'm
not
challenging
it
either.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
i
don't
think
we
did
in
this
case,
your
honor,
but
i
would
have
to
refresh
my
recollection
on
that.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
no.
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
fair,
and
let
me
say...
let
me
go
back
to
furman
and
say
why
i
think
that
this
is
very
important,
that
we
look
at
stringer,
we
look
at
gregg,
we
look
at
maynard,
we
look
at
clemons,
we
look
at
the
subject...
the
notion
of
the
illusory
factor
on
death's
side
of
the
scale.
because
if
you
have,
let's
say,
20
juries
evaluating
identical
sets
of
facts
that
involve
some
of
the
factors
involved...
that
the
prosecutor
argued
in
our
case:
was
the
defendant
intoxicated
or
not;
did
he
have
an
accomplice
or
not,
a
factor
that
the
california
supreme
court
itself
can't
even
agree
on.
when
you
have
that
situation
of
the
20
juries,
you
might
have
10
juries
whose
reaction
to
the
evidence
is
this
is
an
aggravated,
horrible
crime,
it
does
not
outweigh
mitigation,
and
this
defendant
should
be
put
to
death;
and
you
may
have
10
who
conclude
the
defendant
should
not
be
put
to
death.
and
it
is
inevitable
in
our
constitutional
scheme
that
juries
will
react
differently
to
facts,
and
as
long
as
we're
going
to
have
a
death
penalty
and
have
juries
making
the
decision,
that
will
happen
and
defense
lawyers
will
have
to
contend
with
it.
however,
what
happens
when
you
outline
factors,
as
we
do
in
california,
and
you
outline
them
in
a
vague
way,
is
that
you
can
have
the
same
20
juries
looking
at
the
same
set
of
facts
and
coming
to
totally
opposite
conclusions,
10
one
way
and
10
the
other,
not
based
on
the
facts,
not
based
on
their
reaction
to
the
facts,
but
solely
based
on
their
personal
interpretations
of
the
jury
instructions.
and
that's
arbitrariness,
because
we
don't
expect
jurors
to
know
the
law.
the
very
bare
minimum
we
need
to
satisfy
the
eighth
amendment
is
that
we
know
what
the
law
is
in
advance
and
we
all
apply
it
in
the
same
way
from
case
to
case.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
well,
i
think
we
have
two
perfect
cases
to
illustrate
that,
your
honor,
because
mr.
proctor
was
20
and
mr.
tuilaepa
was
21
at
the
times
of
their
respective
crime,
and
in
the
proctor
case
the
jury
was...
the
prosecutor
stipulated
that
age
was
mitigating,
and
in
the
tuilaepa
case
the
prosecutor
argued
it
was
aggravating,
and
their
prior
records
were
not
that
dissimilar.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
because...
i
think...
actually,
i
think
the
state
does
need
to
take
a
position,
even
on
age,
but
certainly
on
some
other
factors
such
as
accomplice
status.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
you
can't
say
it
in
an
abstract
fashion.
in
a
practical
sense,
because
of
how
it's
used
almost
universally
in
california
murder
trials,
you
can,
because
it's
almost
always
argued
as
an
aggravating
factor
against
the
defendant.
if
you
take
a
factor
like
intoxication--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--he's
old
enough
to
know
better.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
i...
prosecutors
do
argue
that
and
highlight
that,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
yes,
they
try.
the...
you
know,
i
want
to
return
to
the
subject
of
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
touchy
as
that
is,
because
apart
from
the
failure
to
label
the
fact...
let
me
start
over
again.
let
me
talk
about
labeling
the
factors
for
a
moment,
because
we're
acting
as
if
it's
a
very
difficult
process
to
label
specific
factors
as
aggravating
or
mitigating,
and
it
isn't.
in
all
other
criminal
sentencing
in
california,
there
are
rules
of
court.
one
rule
says
these
are
factors
to
be
consider
in
aggravation,
another
rule
says
these
are
factors
to
be
considered
in
mitigation.
so
judges,
who
after
all
have
legal
training,
are
given
the
benefit
of
that
in
every
criminal
sentencing
process.
it's
just
jurors
who,
as
we
know,
are
unskilled
in
sentencing,
who
have
to
grapple
with
the
broader
unspecified
concepts.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
i
don't
know
what
it
should
tell
us,
but
i
know
that
we're
capable
of
being
told
because
we
do
it.
i
think
this
is
not
a
decision...
that
this...
what
we're
talking
here
about,
the
process
of
instructing
the
jury,
the
substantive
decisions--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--it
is.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
well,
if
i
were
passing
the
law,
i
would
probably
choose
arbitrarily
an
age,
as
the
legislature
would,
and
it
might
be
25
or
30,
i
don't
it
would
be
17
or
18.
and
i
would
say
above
that
it's
aggravating,
below
that
it's
neutral,
or
below
that
it's
mitigating
and
above
that
it's
neutral.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
i
think
that
if
i
answer
that
question
i'll
just
be
in
trouble,
no
matter
how
i
answer
it.
[laughter]
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
let
me
return
briefly
to
the
subject
of
circumstances
of
the
crime,
because
i
think
it
capsulizes--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--i
don't
know.
yes,
there
are...
i'm
sure
there
are
figures,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
them
at
my
fingertips.
probably
the
california
appellate
project
keeps
track
of
them.
but
the
29
categories
probably
encompass
90
percent
of
the
murders
in
california,
but
it's
just
a
guess,
because
they
talk
about
virtually
every
species
of
crime.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
not
for
purposes
of
being
here
today,
your
honor,
no.
i
would
like
to
see
it
challenged,
but
that's
not
why
i'm
here.
every
crime
has
circumstances--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--i
hope
so,
your
honor.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
argument
to
make.
i
would
like
to
make
the
argument.
if
i
didn't
feel
constrained
by
the--
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--the
nature
of
this
case
and
the
strategy
of
presenting
it
to
the
california
supreme
court.
there
were
three
special
circumstances
found;
they
were
probably
appropriately
found
under
the
facts
presented
to
the
jury,
if
you
believe
the
prosecution's
view
of
the
evidence.
this
did
not
seem
to
be
the
case
to
make
that
challenge,
whereas
it
seems
to
be
a
very
good
case
to
point
out
some
of
the
other
flaws
which
would
exist
in
the
california
scheme
whether
or
not
the
special
circumstance
is
adequately
narrow.
i'm...
i
think
it
should
be
challenged.
i
just
don't
think
that
procedurally
i'm
allowed
to
do
so
here.
if
your
honors
tell
me
i
may--

ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
--it

raised
in
mr.
gillingham's
brief,
i
believe,
at
least
noted
in
his
brief
and
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
california
appellate
project,
the
breadth
of
those
special
circumstances.
it's
not
a
secret
subject
in
california.
it's
simply
that
it
is
not
within
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
ms.
wendy
cole
lascher
i
think...
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
vague
because
the
special
circumstances
are
so
broad,
and
i
also
think
it's
vague
even
if
the
court
held
that
that
adequately
defines
the
crime.
because
once
you
tell
the
jury
that
it
can
make
the
decision
between
life
and
death
based
on
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
you
don't
tell
the
jury
what
the
word
"aggravating"
means
and
you
don't
tell
the
jury
what
the
word
"mitigating"
means
and
you
don't
tell
the
jury
how
to
tell
whether
the
circumstances
are
aggravating
or
mitigating,
obviously
the
jury's
already
considering
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
but
when
it
starts
piling
things
up
and
weighing
them,
putting
them
in
a
balancing
process,
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
is
always
going
to
be
a
factor
in
favor
of
the
prosecution,
because
it
always
exists.
and
if
that
were
all
it
took
for
the
jury
to
make
the
determination,
the
state
wouldn't
need
to
list
it
as
a
factor.
one
way
to
solve...
save
the
california
statute
would
be
to
eliminate
factor
(a)
and
then
to
label
the
other
factors
as
aggravating
or
mitigating
to
the...
at
least
to
the
extent
that's
possible.
i
think
the
main
point
that
i
want
to
leave
with
the
court
is
that...
one
i
stated
before,
if
the
jury...
if
juries
come
to
different
decisions
based
on
their
different
reactions
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
it's
inevitable
or
at
least
it's
understandable.
but
if
they
do
it
because
the
law
purports
to
give
them
guidance
but
in
fact
misguides
them,
that
is
unconstitutional.
