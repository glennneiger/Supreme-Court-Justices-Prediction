mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
thank
you,
your
honor.
all
things
considered,
i'd
rather
have
a
sandwich,
but
i'm
ready,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
come
here
today
relying
upon
our
record
and
the
clear,
firm,
unequivocal
mandate
of
this
court.
if
a
state
chooses
to
use
aggravating
factors
in
the
penalty
determination
phase
and
they
play
a
critical
role,
they're
subject
to
vagueness
analysis
under
the
eighth
amendment,
because
vague,
aggravating
circumstances...
vague,
aggravating
circumstance
increases
the
risk
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
sentencing,
and
therefore
it
gives
no
guidance.
did
california
choose
to
use
an
aggravating
circumstance?
it
did.
are
the
factors
in
california
central
to
the
decision?
they
are.
is
that
centrality
manifested
in
a
weighing
scheme?
absolutely.
and
we
know
by
those
factors
what
happened
here.
we
look
to
the
record.
we
start
with
the
verdicts.
we,
the
jury,
find
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh,
substantially
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances,
and
the
penalty
should
be
death.
that
was
the
death
verdict.
there
was
one
other,
the
opposite
conclusion
coming
to
life
if
the
aggravating
circumstances
did
not
outweigh
the
mitigations.
the
instructions
from
the
court...
as,
justice
kennedy,
you
just
referred
to
how
important
they
are
when
they
come
from
the
court...
told
the
jury
to
weigh
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
to
assign
a
value
to
those
factors.
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor,
second
most
important
person
in
the
courtroom.
the
factors
are
the
essence
of
the
case,
the
fundamental
issue.
you'll
be
weighing
those
factors.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
on
the
contrary,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
on
the
contrary.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
your
honor
is
referring
basically
to
georgia,
in
the
sense
of
the
jury
is
allowed,
after
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
found,
to
rely
on
their
own
common
understanding,
deliberations,
discussions.
but
what
happens
in
california...
again
though
not
required,
but
california
has
chosen
to
give
the
jury
a
menu,
a
shopping
list
perhaps,
a
lens
to
evaluate
the
evidence
through.
and
when
that
lens
is
distorted
by
vagueness,
it
distorts
the
process.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
and
it's
exactly
what
was
argued
in
stringer,
your
honor,
and
that
is
not
the
distinguishing
point
because
if
that
were
the
case,
basically
stringer
would
have
overruled
zant.
because
in
zant,
as
in
stringer,
there
were
otherwise
two
valid
aggravating
factors.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
they
are
distinguishing
without
a
difference,
your
honor,
in
this...
in
some
ways,
but
in
other
ways,
to
use
justice
kennedy's
description
in
stringer,
it's
worse
in
the
penalty
phase
determination,
it's
absolutely
worse.
it's
at
this
time
that
the
jury
is
sitting
there
needing
the
guidance,
just
about
ready
to
decide
life
or
death,
and
we
give
them
not
a
narrow...
not
a
narrow
aggravator,
as
all
the
states
have,
we
give
them
not
even
a
singly
directed
aggravator
such
as
in
maynard,
the
"heinous,
cruel,
and
atrocious.
"
or
the
"outrageously
vile",
and
those
are
vague.
we
give
them
only
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
the
special
circumstance
found
true.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
georgia...
what
happens
is
those
states
that
choose...
those
states
that
choose
to
give
the
jury
additional
direction,
additional
guidance,
have
a
responsibility
to
give
guidance
that's
not
illusory.
for
example,
in
this
case--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--they
are
not
irrelevant
in
themselves,
your
honor.
it's
a
question
of
what
the
jury
thinks
they
mean.
this
is
the
problem.
when
the
state
chooses
to
identify--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--but
to
weigh
factors...
what
we
have
to
keep
in
mind,
your
honor,
is
the
difference
between
the
evidence,
the
data
base,
and
the
fact
that
these
factors
are
a
lens
through
which
the
jury
is
told
to
look
at
this
evidence.
in
juror...
in
georgia--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--what
happens
is
it's
obviously
aggravating
in
these
cases.
that
is,
that's
how
it
turns
out.
these
are--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--your
honor--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--your
honor,
factor
(k)
tells
the
jury
to
consider
the
mitigating
or
extenuating
circumstances
of
the
crime.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
if
there's
going
to
be
any
mitigation
element
to
the
factors
in
california,
it's
going
to
be
in
factor
(k),
which
is
the
fifth
factor
in
our
case,
in
tuilaepa.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
that's
where
the
entrance
of
mitigation
is.
there's
no
question
that
(a)
is
the
aggravation
from
a
common
sense
understanding,
but
the
difference
between
jury...
from
georgia
and
california
is
california
has
taken
upon
itself
to
give
additional
benefit,
to
give
additional
guidance,
and
they
do
it
in
illusory
fashion
so
that
it's
not
inconsistent
with
georgia;
georgia
is
different.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
absolutely.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
i'm
not,
your
honor.
if
i
understand,
we're
talking
about
the
special
circumstances,
what
we
call
special
circumstances.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
absolutely.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
and,
in
fact,
many
of
those
factors
are
actually
taken
to
the
penalty
phase
in
many
of
the
weighing
states
and
called
aggravating
circumstances
in
the
weighing
phase.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
but
the
point
is
one
of
them
was
vague,
your
honor,
and
what
we're
saying
is
under
maynard
and
godfrey
where
there
was
an
additional...
additional
description
and
effort
to
define,
quote,
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
that
is
heinous,
atrocious,
this
court
said
well,
wait
a
second,
that
could
apply
to
any
court...
any
case,
that
could
apply
to
every
single
murder.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
souter,
in
california
there
simply
is
no
way,
given
the
verdict,
given
the
instructions,
that
this
jury
didn't
believe
that
as
a
general
absolute
principal,
that
the
aggravating
factors
were
critical.
that's
one.
two,
they
had
to
know.
indeed,
they
couldn't
know
anything
else,
but
they
had
to
put
some
value
on
those
factors
and
they
had
to
weigh
them.
and,
in
the
fact...
to
the
extent
that
they
had
to
weigh--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--i
think
not,
your
honor,
other
than
to
the
extent
that
they're
much
more
vague
and
illusory.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
i
don't
understand.
you
lost
me.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
yes.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
practically
speaking,
what
happens
in
the
court
is
that
each
and
every
one
of
those
factors
are
aggravating
or
argued
aggravating,
as
you've
seen
in
the
amicus
briefs,
i'm
sure.
and--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--and
i
have
made
that
argument.
i
have
made
it
time
and
time
again.
and
the
argument
that
if
he
was
old
enough
to
do
this
crime,
for
me
to
stand
up
and
successfully
argue...
i
have
men
on
death
row
who
can
testify
to
the
efficacy
of
my
argument
in
those
regards.
each
and
every
time,
your
honor,
there's
only
one
factor
really
that
is
mitigating
for
the
defendant,
and
that's
(k).
and
that's
(k).
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
(k)
is
the
one
at
the
end,
your
honor,
the
last
one
in
my
case
also,
that
has
any
other
circumstance
that
could
extenuate
the
crime--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--and
now
added
through
common
law
with
the
other
background
record,
et
cetera,
to
satisfy
lockett.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
absolutely.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
california--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--the
"they",
the
reference
of
"they".
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
yes.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
yes.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
in
california
they
are
limited,
the
jury
is
limited
to
the
statutory
factors.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
okay.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
it
absolutely
will.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
and
as
you'll
see
in
the
next
argument,
even
when
there's
no
evidence
of
some,
we'll
have
those
used
as
aggravators
in
california,
but
that's
not
my
case.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
and,
indeed,
in
every
state,
i
think
perhaps
other
than
california,
it's
indicated
and
described
as
a
mitigating
factor.
in
california
it's
not
described
at
all.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
but
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
it's
one
thing
for
me
to
argue
it...
and
i
must
say
it
is
an
uphill
battle
in
each
and
every
case,
given
the
fact
that
when
you
get
there
you
have
a
first-degree
murder
with
a
special
circumstance.
it's
one
thing
for
me
to
argue
that,
especially
without
the
age
factor
being
there
at
all,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
fair
game
and
a
jury
on
their
own
can
consider
that
and
do
with
it
what
they
will.
but
in
california
the
state
has
said
age
has...
is
something
special,
so
the
jury
has
to
go
down
that
list.
perhaps
this
answers--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--well,
we...
of
course,
we
address
them,
i
do
on
behalf
of
tuilaepa,
one
by
one.
it's
not
a
global
attack
necessarily,
it's
one
by
one,
and
my--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--well,
i'd
need
to
know
what
the
factors
were.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
that
would
not
cure
of
vagueness
of
(a),
for
example.
it
would
not
cure
the
maynard
problem
with
(a)
at
all.
and
this
court
has
said...
even
in
states
like
oklahoma
and
other
states
that
have
tried
to
embellish
what
we
would
call
factor
(a),
california
is
the
only
state...
and
i
want
to
be
sure
that
the
court
is
clear
that
we're
not
saying
that
they
can't
consider
circumstances
of
the
crime.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
well,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--i'm
not
sure
we're
talking
about
the
same
vagueness.
i'm
talking
about
the
vagueness
of
(a).
am
i
on
track?
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
all
right.
and
now,
again,
your
honor,
if
i
might.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
okay.
i'd
like
to
reserve.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
thank
you.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
justice
scalia,
you
smiled
when
there
was
a
reference
to
the
possibility
of
there
being
a
mitigator,
and
indeed
i've
seen
juries
almost
do
the
same
thing.
because
what
happens...
and
we
have
it
in
proctor's
case...
is
that
we
have
these
factors
put
up
there
by
the
state
of
california,
and
it's
not
as
counsel
paints
it.
if
he
paints
it...
if
it's
that
way
in
california,
this
is
a
barn
and
not
a
courtroom,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
what
it
appears
to
be.
the
case...
the
proctor
court
itself
said
the
jurors
would
have
understood
that
they
had
to
weigh
these
factors,
aggravating
and
mitigating.
let's
talk
about
what
happened
in
the
courtroom.
the
jury
was
told
they
had
to
weigh
these
factors
and
the
man
stands
here
and
says
it's
not
a
weighing
state.
if
this
court
is
prepared...
and
i
don't
think
it
is...
to
turn
its
back
on
stringer,
on
maynard,
my
god,
to
say
that
these
factors
are
not
used.
age,
he
only
argued
age;
he
didn't
argue
it
as
a
aggravator.
he
was
old
enough
to
plan
and
execute
a
robbery,
he
was
sophisticated
enough
to
execute
a
robbery,
and
a
human
being,
a
rifle,
squeezed
the
trigger,
hunk
of
lead
tore
through
flesh.
so
when
you
think
about
the
defendant's
age,
think
about
what
he
did.
so
even
age
can
creep
up
into
circumstances
of
the
crime.
oh,
he
wasn't
arguing
it
in
aggravation,
was
he.
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
i
wonder
what
they
would
think.
they
would
think
it
was
aggravating,
and
they
think
it
every
time
i've
tried
the
case,
your
honor.
the
california
supreme
court
itself,
justice
kennedy,
has
identified
(d),
(e),
(f),
(g),
and
(h)
as
only
being
mitigating.
funny
thing,
justice
scalia,
they
don't
tell
the
jury.
the
jury
doesn't
get
told.
it's
a
facade.
i'm
embarrassed
to
say
that.
i
don't
say
that
with
hostility.
the
california
supreme
court
says
those
factors,
whatever
one
things
of
the
judgment,
can
only
be
mitigating,
but
we
don't
tell
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
and
the
prosecutor
is
able
to
stand
up...
i've
been
there
time
and
time
again...
there's
no
evidence
that
the
victim
consented.
he
did
it
in
proctor.
do
you
think
mrs.
stendal
consented
to
being
raped
and
stabbed?
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
ladies
and
gentlemen,
there's
no
evidence
of
mental
disease.
you
saw
what
mr.
tuilaepa
did,
ladies
and
gentlemen.
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
your
honor--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--your
honor,
i'm
going
back
to
a
courtroom--
mr.
howard
w.
gillingham
--i
didn't.
