but,
mr.
gillingham,
how
could
the
vagueness
of
one
of
those
factors
produce
any
more
random
decisions
than
not
giving
the
jury
any
factors
at
all
and
just
saying
having
found
one
of
the
necessary
conditions
for
imposing
the
death
penalty,
which
california
says
is
prior
to
the...
to
this
stage
of
the
case,
just
telling
the
jury
once
you've
found
guilt
with
one
of
these
statutory
factors
that
enable
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
it's
up
to
you
to
propose
the
death
penalty
or
not.
surely
the
vagueness
of
one
of
the
factors
can't
be
any
more
arbitrary
than
that,
any
more
random
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it's
more
random.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
vague
factor
is
more
random
than
saying
do
what
you
like,
we
won't
tell
you
any
factors
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gillingham,
suppose
the
way
it
read
was
the
jury
may
consider
the
following
aggravating
circumstances,
(a)
through
(j),
and
then,
in
addition,
the
jury
may
consider
(k),
whatever
mitigating
circumstances
it
considers
relevant,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
ones,
the
same
ones,
(a)
through
(j),
just
what
you
have
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
cure
that
vagueness,
as
you've
said,
simply
to
not
say
anything
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
list
any
factors
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
vagueness
you
think
infects
(a)
through
(j).
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
right.
i
understand
your
position
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
say
that's
mitigating?
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
say
that's
mitigating
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
sort
of
saying
that
you
can
argue
against
the
existing
of
a
mitigating
factor
and
always
make
it
sound
like
an
aggravating
factor.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
are
you
going
to
say
this
defendant
is
too
young
to
appreciate
this
crime.
no
way
this
defendant
is
too
young.
i
mean
you're
really
just
denying
the
mitigating
effect,
but
you
can
make
it
sound
aggravating,
i
suppose.
