mr.
william
george
prahl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
key
to
a
resolution
of
the
issue
before
this
court
was
explored
during
a
series
of
questions
to
mr.
gillingham
posed
by
justice
souter
dealing
with
the
differences
between
the
cal...
between
california's
unique
death
penalty
statute
and
that
of
the
mississippi
statute
at
issue
in
this
court's
stringer
case.
it's
critical
to
an
understanding
of
the
case
before
you
that
you
understand...
that
the
fundamental
difference
between
these
two
statutes
is
examined.
in
mississippi,
the
narrowing
factor
is
found
at
the
penalty
trial
and
plays
a
dual
role.
it
not
only...
the
aggravating
circumstance
not
only
narrows...
the
propositional
aggravating
circumstance
not
only
narrows,
but
it
also
plays
a
role
within
the
jury's
sentencing
determination.
in
california,
the
special
circumstances
are
found
during
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
these
are
the
narrowing
factors
that
make
the
defendant
death-eligible.
unlike
mississippi,
in
california
when
a
defendant's
penalty
trial
begins,
he
is
completely
and
fully
and
finally
death-eligible.
this
is
at
the
start
of
the
penalty
trial.
this
is
a
significant
difference.
like
the
aggravating
circumstances,
as
they're
called,
in
georgia,
the
special
circumstances
in
california,
these
narrowing
factors
virtually
disappear
at
the
sentencing
phase,
and
instead
the
jury
is
told
at
the
sentencing
phase
to
consider,
take
into
account,
and
be
guided
by
a
number
of
relevant
factors
on
the
issue
that's
before
the
jury
at
that
time,
whether
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment.
mr.
william
george
prahl
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
george
prahl
no,
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
correct.
that's
one
point
we
did
want
to
clarify.
this
notion
about
the...
while
it's
not
at
issue
here,
i
think
it
deserves
a
comment,
and
that
is,
for
example,
ordinary
premeditated
deliberate
first
degree
murder,
premeditation
and
deliberation,
first
degree
murder,
is
not
a
special
circumstance
in
california
which
makes
the
defendant
death-eligible.
so
what
a
lot
of
people
would
regard
as
the
most...
one
of
the
more
serious
forms
of
first
degree
murder,
premeditation
and
deliberation,
in
the
absence
of
the
commission
of
a
felony,
in
absence
of
one
of
the
other
enumerated
factors,
just
premeditation
and
deliberation
alone
is
not
enough
to
make
a
defendant
death-eligible.
second
degree
murder,
for
example,
the
whole
category
of
second
degree
murder,
a
number
of
felony
murders
other
than
felony
murders--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--oh,
a
multiple
murder
in
the
same
proceeding,
yes,
your
honor,
that's
a
multiple
murder.
mr.
william
george
prahl
that's
a
multiple
murder.
that's
if
you
killed
more
than
one
person
within
this
indictment.
mr.
william
george
prahl
yes,
your
honor.
but,
again,
a
number
of
felony
murders,
absent
the
felony
murder...
the
felony
specified
in
our
statute
in
the
special
circumstance,
a
number
of
those
are...
i
would
seriously
dispute...
i
don't
have
the
figures
here
because
we
were...
we
were
never
told
that
we
were
going
to
be
discussing
the
eligibility
factors,
but
in
close
to
17
or
18
years
of
working
with
our
death
penalty
statute,
we
have
slightly
more
than
400
convictions.
so
if
we're
talking
about
90
percent
of
the
murders
being
death-eligible,
those
numbers
just
don't
work
out
in
my
mind.
i
mean
just
on
a
priori
sense,
that's
just
not
even
close.
we
have
so
many
more
murders
than
that
in
california
that
it's--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--right
now
we
have
a
little
over
400,
i
believe,
in
total.
we
have
approximately
200
and
some
cases
that
would
be
affected
directly
by
the
decision
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
william
george
prahl
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
george
prahl
oh,
certainly,
your
honor.
i
mean,
again,
the
prosecutor
is
making
a...
not
only
a
statutory...
taking
a
statutory
look
at
a
case,
but
he's
also
looking
at
it
from
a
practical
sense--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
basically
the
horses
to
pull
the
wagon,
and
if
they're
not
there
he's
not
going
to
charge
it.
california
is
not
arguing
in
this
case
that
vagueness
or
overbreadth
has
any
role
in
the
eligibility
phase
of
a
death
penalty
case.
however,
this
court
has
consistently
applied
different
rules
to
the
sentencing
phase
of
a
capital
case.
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings,
the
inquiry
may
be
far-reaching
and
actually
should
involve
a
myriad
of
factors
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment.
the
two
phases
of
a
case
are
simply
different.
and
california's...
california
is
actually
a
hybrid
statute.
it's
unfair
to
characterize
california
as
a
weighing
state,
as
that
term
has
come
to
be...
or
as
that
term
has
been
adopted
as
a
term
of
art
within
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence.
california...
indeed,
this
court
has
observed
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
basically
whatever
statutory
scheme
is
involved,
be
it
texas,
be
it
georgia,
be
it
louisiana,
whatever
state,
basically
when
it
gets
right
down
to
it,
the
juries
weigh,
the
juries
consider
the
facts...
the
evidence
that's
before
them
on
this
very
important
question
of
life
or
death.
mr.
william
george
prahl
california,
in
fact,
has
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel
within
its
statutory
scheme.
but,
again,
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel
is
a
special
circumstance
in
california
that's
basically
been
judicially
declared
invalid
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
william
george
prahl
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the...
theoretically
it
might
be
possible
to
do
it,
but,
again,
the
nature
of
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel
already
comes
in
under
factor
(a),
which
are
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
in
other
words,
the
circumstances
of
the
offense--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
be
consistent
with
california's
statutory
scheme.
mr.
william
george
prahl
because
california
does
not
have,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
what
are
called
propositional
circumstances
or
propositional
sentencing
factors.
california
asks
the
jury...
and,
in
fact,
that's
another
point
that
i
think
i
should
clarify
here.
mr.--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--mr.
gillingham
indicated,
for
example,
that
in
practice
all
of
the
factors
except
the
last
one,
factor
(k),
the
extenuating
evidence,
character,
background
material,
are
in
fact
aggravating.
that's
simply
not
the
case.
that's
not
the
way
the
jury
is
instructed,
nor
is
it,
in
fact,
the
case
the
way
either
of
these
two
cases
was
argued.
i
think
you
have
to
take
a
good,
long
look
at
how
these
cases
were
argued.
age,
for
example,
in
this
case...
in
neither
case
was
age
presented
as
an
aggravating
circumstance.
age
was
argued
in
proctor...
in
fact,
age
was
acknowledged
by
the
prosecutor
in
proctor
to
be
a
mitigating
factor.
look
at
the
argument
closely
in
the
tuilaepa
case.
in
tuilaepa
the
prosecutor
argued
first
and
argued
only
once.
he
was
not
able
to
rebut
the
defense
argument.
he
was
faced
with
a
situation
of
anticipating
what
the
defense
counsel
would
argue
and
trying
to
deal
with
that
evidence
or
that
material
in
his
own
argument.
his
argument
was
not
that
age
should
be
considered
by
the
jury
to
be
an
aggravating
circumstance
or
an
aggravating
sentencing
factor.
what
he
argued
was
look
at
mr.
tuilaepa's
background
and
decide
whether
this
rises
to
the
level
of
a
mitigating
factor.
he
argued
against
the
jury's
consideration
of
this
as
a
mitigating
factor,
and
certainly
he
has
a
right
to
do
that.
these
can't
be
so
all
or
nothing
at
all
that
the
prosecution
can't
even
simply
comment
on
whether
they're
legitimately
considered
as
mitigation.
the
prosecutor
never
argued
in
tuilaepa...
and
certainly
in
proctor
he
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
mitigating
factor.
and
that
goes
to
what
i
think
justice
souter...
the
point
that
was
made
during
the
questions
you
asked
to
mr.
gillingham
regarding
the
nature
of
the
sentencing
factors
in
california.
they
basically
are
factors
that
guide...
allow
the
jury
to
consider
and
take
into
account.
they're
not
the
kinds
of
things
on
which
the
jury
is
asked
to
make
a
finding
and
then
balance
that
finding
against
findings
on
other
evidence.
the
question
of
whether
death
is
the...
or
the
question
on
whether
there
are
limits
to
the
types
of
evidence
which
may
be
presented--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--no,
your
honor,
but
certainly
the
absence
of...
and
that
was,
in
fact,
the
case
in
the
proctor
situation.
i
think...
are
you
referring
to
factor
(c)?
mr.
william
george
prahl
that
factor,
i
believe,
was
acknowledged...
well,
in
proctor,
i'm
sorry,
he
did
have
a
prior
felony
conviction.
but
as
to
(b),
the
presence
or
absence
of
evidence
of
prior
violent
conduct,
it
was
acknowledged
by
the
prosecutor
to
be
mitigating
evidence.
it's
consistently
argued
that
the
absence,
for
example,
of
prior
felony
conduct
can
be...
can
be
a
mitigating
factor.
in
other
words,
prior
to
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
davenport,
there
was
some
confusion
about
whether
the
absence
of
a
factor
could
be
argued
for
the
reverse
of
the
proposition.
however,
once
davenport
was
decided
by
the
california
supreme
court
after
the
proctor
case...
following
proctor,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
certain
of
these
factors,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
should
be
considered
only
in
mitigation.
so
mr.
gillingham's
statement
that,
in
fact,
all
of
the
factors
except
for
(k)
are
aggravation
is
simply
not
true
under
california
law.
they're
not
true
under
the
facts
of
these
cases
and
they're
not
true
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
california's
decision
on
how
to
handle
these,
though,
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
constitution
does
not
limit...
neither
the
eighth
amendment
nor
the
fourteenth
amendment
limits
how
the
states
can
allow
the
jury
to
consider
this
evidence.
yes.
mr.
william
george
prahl
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
factors--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--oh,
no,
your
honor,
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
can
be
either
mitigating
or
aggravating.
mr.
william
george
prahl
as
can
factor
(b)
or
(c).
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
to
the
proctor
brief
on
page--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--i'll
see
if
i
can
go
through
these.
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
can
either
be
mitigating
or
aggravating.
mr.
william
george
prahl
and
the
jury
is
specifically
told
that.
(d),
(e),
(f),
(g),
and
(h)
under
state
law
are
all
mitigating.
they
have
to
be
mitigating...
they
have
to
be
considered
mitigating.
(i),
age,
can
be
either.
(j)
is
generally
regarded
to
be...
or
it
must
be
mitigating,
and
(k)
is
only
mitigating
by
its
very
terms.
so
a
majority
of
the...
of
the...
the
largest
number
of
the
factors
are
essentially
limited
by
state
law
or
by
their
very
terms
to
mitigation.
now,
mr.
gillingham--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--under
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
people
v.
davenport,
the
california
supreme
court
has
decided...
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
not
based
on
any
federal
constitutional
interpretation,
but
just
as
a
matter
of
supervision
over
the
state's
statute...
that
those
factors
would
only
be
mitigating.
and
that's
what's
led
to
what's
called
davenport
error.
davenport
error
in
california
is
where
the
prosecutor
suggests
that
the
absence
of
a
mitigating
factor
makes
it
aggravating.
that
in
the
absence
of
mitigation...
the
fact
that,
for
example,
whether
or
not
the
victim
was
a
participant.
well,
if
it
shows
that
the
victim
was
not
a
participant,
that
would
seem
to
aggravate.
and
we
certainly
wish
your
honor
had
participated
in
the
davenport
decision,
because
i
think
we
might
have
a
different
rule
in
california.
but,
in
fact,
the
california
supreme
court,
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
and
in
the
interests
of
fairness,
has
decided
to
limit
certain
of
these
factors.
mr.
william
george
prahl
no,
whether
the
victim
was
a
participant,
your
honor.
mr.
william
george
prahl
he...
that
factor...
yes,
your
honor,
the
prosecutor...
and
that
would...
and
the
defense
counsel
would...
if
there
were
an
argument
along
those
lines,
defense
counsel
would
object
and
the
jury...
or
the
judge
would
instruct
the
jury
accordingly.
but
that's
since
davenport.
now,
it's
important
to
realize
that
davenport
was...
had
not
been
decided
when
the
proctor
case
went
to
trial.
but
there
is
an
instruction
in
the
superior
court,
judge
grossfeld,
that
handled
the
retrial,
in
his
wisdom
specifically
anticipated
the
davenport
decision
and
specifically
told
the
jury
if...
this
is
from
the
proctor
joint
appendix
at
page
80.
"if
a
factor
is
not
found
by
you
to
be
a
mitigating
factor,
that
in
and
of
itself
does
not
make
that
factor
an
aggravating
factor.
"
"in
order
for
a
factor
to
be
considered
an
aggravating
factor,
you
must
be
satisfied
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
factor
does
exist
and
that
it
is
only
if
you
determine
that
the
factor
exists
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
you
may
consider
the
factor
to
be
aggravating.
"
mr.
william
george
prahl
oh,
that's
probably
a
situation
where
there's
some
type
of
drug
deal
where
there's
two
or
more
people
involved
in
some
sort
of
criminal
activity
and
something
goes
wrong.
it's...
all
of
these
factors
are
anticipatory
in
the
sense
that
they...
what
they
have
tried
to
do
is
anticipate
the
circumstances
that
may
arise
in
a
capital
case,
to
give
the
jury
some
kind
of
guidance.
when
california's...
the
legislative
history
of
the
california
statute
is
interesting
in
that
california
basically
adopted
this
format
in
1977
as
a
result
of
this
court's
1976...
the
five
cases
decided
in
1976.
california's
statutory
scheme
is
basically
a
hybrid.
if
you
want
to
have
to...
if
you
have
to
give
it
a
name,
we'd
look
through...
and
you
can
best
characterize
california
not
as
a
weighing
state,
not
as
a
special
issue
state
like
texas;
california
is
more
of
a
guiding
state.
what
we
tried...
what
california
tried
to
do,
and
it's
fairly
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
is
adopt
the
best
factors
or
the
best
aspects
of
the
georgia
statute
and
the
texas
statute
and
the
florida
statute.
there
are
comparisons
all
through
both
this
court's
prior
cases
and
through
the
california
supreme
court's
prior
cases
where
there
are
allusions,
for
example,
to
the
somewhat
analogous
factors
of
the
california
statute
that
relate
to
various
other
state
schemes.
california
tried
to
draw
on
what
this
court
had
said
were
the
constitutional
aspects
of
a
death
penalty
statute
in
arriving
at
its
own
hybrid
system
which,
again,
places
the
special
circumstance
determination,
the
eligibility
determination
in
the
guilt
phrase,
begins
with
a
penalty
phase
where
the
defendant
is
completely
death-eligible,
and
then
gives
the
jury
something
to
look
at
in
arriving
at
that
decision.
i
agree
with
your
honor.
i
agree
with
justice
kennedy
that
i
think
it's
remarkable
that
defense
counsel
would
actually
prefer
a
system
like
georgia
as
opposed
to
a
california
system.
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
the
argument
in
the
proctor
case,
in
proctor
under
circumstance
(a)
which
the
defendant's...
which
is
really
the
heart
of
what's
at
issue
here.
age
is
really
not
at
issue
here,
because
in
proctor
the
prosecutor
agreed
and
in
tuilaepa
he
didn't
argue
that
it
was
aggravating,
he
argued
against
a
finding
of
mitigation.
i
can...
i'll
talk
a
little
bit
about
(b)
in
a
moment.
factor
(b)
is
really
not
at
issue
in
proctor.
the
prosecutor
acknowledged
in
the
proctor
case
that
(b)
was
a
mitigating
factor,
that
the
lack
of
any
prior
violent
conduct
by
mr.
proctor
was
not
a
factor
in
aggravation,
it
was
mitigating.
(b)
is
only
raised
by
petitioner
tuilaepa,
and
we...
i
can
talk
about
that
in
just
a
moment.
but
it's
(a)
that
is
common
to
both
of
these
cases
and
is
really
the
heart
of
what's
being
challenged
as
being
too
vague
in
these
two
cases.
if
you
look
at
(a)
in
both
cases,
you'll
see
that
defendant...
or
mr.
proctor,
petitioner
proctor,
in
fact
argued
very
strenuously
that
under
(a)
there
were
factors...
or
circumstances
of
this
offense
that
mitigated
his
culpability
and
were
things
that
the
jury
should
consider
in
arriving
at
a
penalty
other
than
death.
what
were
those
factors?
he
argued
that
if
the
victim
had
been...
had
predeceased
the
torture,
if
she
had
died
before
he
stabbed
her
around
her
breasts
and
around
her
neck,
before
he
beat
her
and
before
he
raped
her,
if
she
died...
if
she
was
dead
or
unconscious,
well
she
didn't
suffer
all
that
pain.
that's
not
an
aggravating
factor
then,
that's
mitigating,
he
was
kind
enough
to
have
killed
her
first.
if--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--the
defendant
in
the...
that
was
the
argument
in
proctor.
he
argued
that
they...
that
they
certainly
weren't
aggravating...
that
they
didn't
rise
to
the
level
of
aggravation.
mr.
william
george
prahl
no.
he
did
argue,
with
regard
to
mitigation,
the
possible
involvement
of
the
other
young
man
involved
in
the
case.
he
said,
you're
not
really
sure,
you
can't
really
be
100
percent
positive,
that
mr.
proctor
was
the
one
who
made
that
terrible
bloody
palmprint
in
the
bedroom,
or
he's
not
the
one
that
did
it
while
he
was
killing
her.
but
he
argued
that
the
possibility
of
mr.
manley's
involvement
in
the
case
was
sufficient
to
rise
to
the
level...
or
at
least,
again,
take
this
out
of
the
area
of
an
aggravating
factor.
there
were
substantial
arguments
made
under
factor
(a)
in
the
proctor
case
regarding
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
and
in
tuilaepa,
even
that
case,
it's
interesting
to
see
how
the
defense
attorney
argued
factor
(a)
there.
he
argued
that
mr.
tuilaepa
had
no
intention
of
killing
anyone
when
he
went
into
that
tavern
that
afternoon;
that
it's
only
because
one
of
the
patrons
started
to
fight
with
his
codefendant
that
mr.
tuilaepa
was
drawn
into
this
to
kill.
i
think
there's
a
reference
in
that
argument
to
the
fact
that
mr.
tuilaepa
only
brought
a.22
to
the
confrontation
rather
than
an
aggressive
weapon
like
an
assault
rifle
or
a.357
magnum.
well,
that's
clearly...
i
mean
there's...
that's
not
an
aggravating...
that
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
aggravation.
there's--
mr.
william
george
prahl
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
george
prahl
well,
i
think
you
can
attempt
to
characterize
it...
it's
fair
to
characterize
that
as
an
attempt
to
lessen
the
aggravating
impact
of
it
and
to
draw
it
more
to
the
mitigating
side
of
the
question.
i
mean,
it's...
this
is
not
a
question
where
the...
that
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
all...
especially
(a),
that
it
all
pulls
in
one
direction.
that's
just
simply
not
true,
and
it's
not
true
in
either
of
these
cases.
now,
there
are
always
going
to
be
circumstances
of
the
offense,
that's
true,
but
those
are
the
factors
which
this
court
has
consistently
demanded...
not
just
suggested
but
demanded
be
placed
before
the
jury
at
the
sentencing
phase.
so
california
certainly
can't
be
faulted
for
allowing
the
jury
to
basically
consider,
take
into
account,
and
be
guided
by
these
factors
at
the
sentencing
phase.
mr.
william
george
prahl
well,
again,
that
changes
the
basic
nature
of
the
california
statute.
it
would
be...
it
would
not
be
in
keeping...
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be...
whether
that
would
be
valid
or
not.
again,
we
have
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel
within
our
special
circumstances
and
we
have
judicially
declared
that
to
be
invalid
in
california
and
it's
no
longer
used.
now,
if
we
were
to
duplicate
that
within
the
aggravating
factors,
california
has
held,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
we
are
limited
to
only
those
sentencing
factors
that
are
mentioned
in
the
statute.
there
are
no
nonstatutory
aggravating
factors,
although
the
defendant
can
argue
anything
in
response
in
mitigation.
so
the
same
limitation
is
not
applied
to
the
defense
that's
applied
to
the
prosection.
the
prosecution
cannot
argue
nonstatutory
aggravating
factors
beyond
those
that
are...
anything
that's
listed
in
the
statute.
the
defense
can
argue
anything
it
wants,
in
addition
to
the
factors
listed
here.
again,
california
has
gone
out
of
its
way
and
has
vigorously
tried
to
meet
the
concerns
expressed
by
this
court
and
the
eighth
amendment
to
avoid
arbitrary
and
capricious
findings
of
death.
and
we
feel
very
strongly
that
california's
statute...
that
the
hybrid
nature
of
it
is
especially
geared
to
allowing
for
what
this
court
has
called
an
individualized
penalty
determination
where
you
look
at
both
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
the
nature
of
the
offender.
again,
these
factors
are
distinguishable,
clearly
distinguishable
from
those
at
issue
in
stringer
and
those
earlier
cases
which
dealt
with
the
so-called
weighing
states.
in
that
sense,
california
is
not
a
weighing
state.
it's...
the
california
penalty
determination
is
much...
if
it's
closer
to
any
state,
it's
closer
to
georgia
in
that
the
eligibility
determination
is
made
early
on
and
then
basically
drops
away
and
then
the
jury
has
a
guided
amount
of
discretion
to
look
at
certain
relevant
factors.
now,
the
california
supreme
court
in
its
bacigalupo
two
decision,
following
this
court's
remand
of
the
original
bacigalupo
case,
addressed
specifically,
as
this
court
had
asked
the
mississippi
court
to
do
in
stringer...
and
i
believe
there
was
an
earlier
certified
question
in
zant.
the
court
has
specifically
addressed
the
issues
about
the
nature
of
the
california
statute,
and
has
found
that
california
is
not
a
weighing
state
within
the
meaning
of
this
court...
as
that
term
is
used
in
stringer.
the
california
supreme
court
went
on
to
say,
however,
that
there
are
certain
limitations
that
do
apply
to
the
sentencing
phase,
that
they
should
be
relevant
and
specific.
and
the
court...
the
california
supreme
court
announced
that
as
an
eighth
amendment
test.
we
see
that
as
an
unwarranted
expansion
of
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence.
the
eighth
amendment
now
has
two
basic
tests
that
have
been
in
place
for
a
number
of
years:
the
death
penalty
eligibility
should
be
narrowed,
and
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
present
any
mitigating
evidence
and
the
jury
should
be
able
to
act
on
that
evidence.
the
relevance
and
specificity
requirements
for
sentencing
factors,
as
the
california
supreme
court
announced
them,
are
much
closer
to
this
court's
fourteenth
amendment
types
of
questions,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
delaware
v.
dawson
basically
held,
that
when
you
look
at
certain
types
of
evidence
that
is
introduced
at
a
penalty
phase,
that
what
you're
really
looking
at
when
you
get
right
down
to
relevance
is
a
question
of
fourteenth
amendment
notice
and
basic
understanding,
not
an
eighth
amendment
consideration.
and
to
expand
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
beyond
where
it
has
existed
for
years
we
feel
is
unwarranted
since
that
is
basically
covered
already
within
this
court's...
or
within
the
fourteenth
amendment's
proscription
against
irrelevant
considerations.
i
think
delaware
v.
dawson
adequately
addresses
this
question,
and
certainly
the
relevance
criteria,
which
this
court
has
applied
on
several
occasions,
adequately
addresses
that.
and
although
we
don't
basically
have
a
problem
with
the
semantics
of
the
test
announced
in
bacigalupo
two,
we
do
have
some
concern
over
the
constitutional
underpinning
of
that
test.
again,
that's
the
california
supreme
court's
determination
and
this
court
is
here
to
look
at
that
and
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
a
basis
for
expanding
the
eighth
amendment.
unless
this
court
has
any
further
questions,
we're
prepared
to
submit
the
matter.
we
feel
very
strongly,
again,
that
if
the
court...
with
the
court's
understanding
of
the
special
and
unique
nature
of
the
california
statute,
its
hybrid
character,
the
roles
of
the
special
circumstances
in
california
which
are
basically
not
challenged
here,
and
the
relevance
and
materiality
of
those
sentencing
factors,
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
received
a
fair
trial;
that
the
material
that
the
juries
considered
was
not
vague
or
overbroad,
it
was
directed
to
the
very
issue
before
them;
and
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
both
of
the
decisions
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
william
george
prahl
thank
you.
