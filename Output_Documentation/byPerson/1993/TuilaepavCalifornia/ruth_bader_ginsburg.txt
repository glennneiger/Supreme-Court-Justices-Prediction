you
have...
i
want
to
be
clear
on
that
point.
you
are
not
challenging
in
any
way
the
determination
of
the
death-eligible
category,
that
is
the
factors
that
go
into
determining
who
then
gets
to
the
penalty
stage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
do
you
think
that's
an
adequate
way
of
defining
the
death-eligible
category?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
ask,
when
you
answered
that
question,
that
you
are
not
challenging
whether
there's
a
sufficient--
--that's
right.
--narrowing
to
get
to
the
death-eligible
category.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
question
i
would
like
to
ask
you
before
you
proceed
there,
going
back
to
the
question
about
the
special
circumstances.
are
there
any
figures
that
indicate
out
of
the
universe
of
first-degree
murders,
how
many
would
fit
into
one
of
those
special
circumstance
categories?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and,
even
so,
you
haven't
challenged
that
as
not
being
sufficiently
narrowing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.
prahl,
some
of
them,
the
thrust
are
clear,
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
prior
felony
conviction;
the
presence
of
a
felony
conviction
can't
be
considered
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
mitigating,
can
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
uh-hum.
