but,
ms.
lascher,
if
you
take
three
statutory
schemes,
texas,
georgia,
california,
and
assume
that
you
do
not
prevail
on
this
case
and
that
all
of
them
are
constitutional
in
their
broad
outline
and
in
the
specifics
that
you
challenge
here.
if
you
have
a
defendant
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
under
which
of
the
three
statutory
schemes
would
you
prefer
to
have
the
sentence
imposed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
case,
proctor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
of
the
three
systems
that
i
asked
you
about,
you
prefer
the
system
which
gives
the
least
guidance
to
the
jury
from
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right--
--what
if
the
california
scheme
simply
said
there
are,
whatever
it
is,
12
relevant
subjects
of
evidence
that
you
ought
to
consider,
and
i'm
going
to
list
them:
circumstances
of
crime,
age,
et
cetera,
would
that
be
violative
either
of
stringer
or
of
any
constitutional
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
same
jury
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
i
thought
your
point
was
the
jury
has
too
much
guidance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
you're
saying
it
doesn't
have
enough.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
liked
the
georgia
system
because
the
georgia
system
jury
is
free
to
do
what
it
wants.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
can
be
comfortable
with
the
decision
we
make
because
we've
talked
about
things
that
have
a
rational
bearing
on
guilt,
whereas--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--where
in
georgia
we
have
kind
of
a
quaker
prayer
meeting,
everybody's
quiet,
and
they
just
raise
their
hand
and
vote
for
death.
that
could
happen
under
the
georgia
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
making
really
quite
an
amazing
argument,
based
on
our
precedents,
that
the
jury
should
have
no
guidance.
i
had
thought
that
was
the
whole
point--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
about
15
years
of
cases
from
this
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
did
you
challenge
it
at
any
stage
in
the
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
you
assume
that
it's
sufficient,
constitutionally
sufficient.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
what
should
our
legal
training
tell
us
about
whether
age
should
be
mitigating
or
aggravating?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
your
proposition
is
that
the
state
must
commit
itself
as
to
every
listed
factor
as
to
whether
it's
aggravating
or
mitigating.
i
thought
that
was
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
want
to
know
what
you...
what
we
should
do
with
age.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
given
that
explanation,
could
california
add
to
one
of
the
factors
for
the
jury
to
consider
at
the
sentencing
phase
whether
or
not
the
murder
was
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
question
is
could
it
be
added
at
the
sentencing
phase?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
california
just
added
this
phrase
to
the
considerations
that
the
jury
has
in
front
of
it
when
it
is
in
the
sentencing
phase?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm...
why
not...
why
is
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
california...
go
ahead,
please.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
quite
i
understand.
as
to
(e),
for
instance,
"whether
or
not
the
victim
was
a
participant
in
the
defendant's
homicidal
conduct
or
consented
to
the
homicidal
act.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
could
be
aggravating
or
mitigating.
if
he
consented
and
he
was
an
active
participant,
that's
aggravating.
if
he
didn't,
that's
mitigating.
well,
why
is
it
only...
and
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
it's
only
mitigating.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
this
work
in
practice?
is
the
prosecuting
attorney
instructed
that
he
cannot
argue
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
was
a
participant
in
the
crime,
that
would
be
davenport
error?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pardon
me,
whether
the
victim
was
a
participant.
he...
the
prosecutor
cannot
argue
that.
