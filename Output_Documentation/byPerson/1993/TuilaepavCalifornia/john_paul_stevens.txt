justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
go
ahead
and
reserve.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you.
i
know
you're
not...
you
have
more
to
say
to
justice
kennedy,
but
i
really
want
to
understand
a
basic
point
here.
do
either
you
or
your
colleague,
mr.
gillingham,
contend
that
the
special
circumstances
do
not
adequately
narrow
the
people
eligible
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
murders
that
aren't
covered
by
the
special
circumstances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that...
you're
assuming
that
adequately
narrows
the
universe
so
you
get
into
the
next
step.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
not
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
some
other
lawyer
may
have
another
habeas
petition
later
on
down
the
line
who'll
make
that
challenge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
hope
so.
i
question
whether
you
could
make
that
as
a
first
step
to
the
argument
that
you're
now
making?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
didn't
you,
why
didn't
you
make
the
argument?
if
you'd
like
to
make
the
argument,
why
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
if
you
haven't
raised
it
at
all,
but
i
must
confess
i'm
puzzled
as
to
why
no
one
has--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--especially
if
it
makes...
as
you
say,
90
percent
of
the
murders
are
covered
by
your
so-called,
quote,
special
circumstances,
they're
not
very
special.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
a
second
question:
is
california's
death
penalty
statute
vague
as
written
and
applied
and
under
violation
of
stringer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
prahl,
perhaps
i
shouldn't
take
your
time
with
this,
but
i
do
want
you...
at
the
end
of
the
guilt
phase
these
become
death-eligible
if
any
one
of
the
circumstances
have
been
found.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i...
do
i
read
correctly
circumstance
3,
that
if
he's
found
guilty
of
two
second
degree
murder
offenses,
he's
death
eligible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
third
circumstance
is
the
defendant
has...
oh,
has
in
this
proceeding
been
convicted
of
one...
of
more
than
one
offense
of
murder
in
the
first
or
second
degree.
that
doesn't
mean
that
if
he's
convicted
of
two
second
degree
murders
at
the
same
time--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--two
second
degree,
i
see,
i
get
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
had...
two
second
degree
murders
in
the
same
proceeding
would
make
him
death-eligible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
is
it
not
true...
just,
again,
i
realize
that
you
didn't
want
to
spend
your
time
on
this,
but
is
it
not
true
that
there
could
be
murder
cases
which
if
the
prosecutor
elected
to
allege
in
the
indictment
a
special
circumstance,
that
are
not
actually
tried
as
capital
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
making
myself
clear.
are
there
not
murder
cases
in
which
the
facts
might
come
within
a
special
circumstance,
but
in
which
the
prosecutor
did
not
seek
the
death
penalty
or
allege
the
special
circumstance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
all
these
factors
are...
as
a
matter
of
state
law
must
be
mitigating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i'm
sorry,
just
the
youth
and
the
circumstances...
not
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
only
age
that
you're
saying
can...
must
be
mitigating.
i
may
have
failed
to
follow
part
of
your
argument.
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
any...
are
you
aware
of
any
death
case
in
which
the
defendant
has
argued
that
the
circumstances
you
just
described
were
mitigating?
i
can
understand
arguing
they're
not
aggravating
because
she's
dead,
but
i've
never
heard
anyone
argue
that
scenario
would
be
a
mitigating
circumstance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
then
he
also
affirmatively
argued
that
that
scenario
is
mitigating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
this
is
repeating
what
justice
kennedy
asked,
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
supposing
in
that
circumstance
(a),
they
said
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
so
forth
and
so
on,
including
whether
or
not
the
crime
was
cruel,
heinous,
and
atrocious,
would
that
still
be
valid?
