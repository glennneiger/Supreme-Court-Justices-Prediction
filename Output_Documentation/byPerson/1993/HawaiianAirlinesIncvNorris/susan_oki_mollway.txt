ms.
susan
oki
mollway
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
have
lost
sight
of
what
the
rla
is.
the
rla
provides
for
airlines
and
railroads
to
enter
into
agreements,
and
provides
procedures
for
enforcing
those
agreements.
the
world
of
the
rla
is
nothing
more.
nothing
in
the
rla
sets
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
nothing
in
the
rla
prevents
any
government
from
setting
those
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
by
providing
minimum
protections
for
all
workers,
including
workers
covered
by
the
rla.
only
by
ignoring
decades
of
law
can
petitioners
argue
that
the
rla
wipes
out
or
forces
into
an
rla
forum
these
minimum
protections.
beginning
more
than
60
years
ago,
this
court
has
had
opportunities
in
which
it
could
have
held
that
the
rla
governs
such
independent
laws.
this
court
has
never
so
held.
it
did
not
so
hold
in
1931
in
the
norwood
case.
it
did
not
so
hold
12
years
later
in
terminal
railroad,
which,
although
petitioners
have
characterized
it
as
a
state-based
case,
in
reality
began
with
a
union
filing
a
complaint
against
a
railroad
in
a
state
administrative
agency.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
cutback...
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
construction
of
the
omitted
case
language--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--insofar
as
the
omitted
case
language
might
have
been
earlier
construed
to
include
independent
claims,
i
believe
that
cutback
has
already
come.
i
believe
it
came
in
buell
in
1987.
that
case
specifically
involved
a
personal
injury
brought
under
the
fela.
personal
injuries
were
the
only
specific
example
of
omitted
case
in
the
burley
decision,
and
to
the
extent
that
that
decision
was
referring
to
a
personal
injury
covered
by
the
fela,
i
believe
that
omitted
case
did
come,
has
now
been
either
eliminated
or
at
least
rejected
insofar
as
it
might
earlier
have
been
interpreted
in
that
way.
a
lot
of
the
problem
here
i
believe
has
been
recognized
by
the
panel
in
that
petitioners
are
unclear
as
to
what
they
are
really
asking
for.
are
they
asking
for
substantive
preemption...
that
is,
that
all
of
these
minimum
protections
disappear
totally...
or
are
they
asking
for
forum
preemption?
that
is,
that
these
kinds
of
independent
claims
are
funneled
into
the
rla
forum.
they
say,
in
their
briefs,
that
they
are
arguing
for
forum
preemption,
but
they
shift
continually
back
and
forth,
as
in
fact
has
just
occurred
in
the
oral
argument,
and
even
in
their
briefs,
in
their
reply
brief
in
footnote
5,
they
refer
to
what
is
in
essence
substantive
preemption,
wiping
out
these
rights.
obviously,
the
analysis
that
will
be
applied
to
petitioner's
case
will
differ
depending
on
which
kind
of
preemption
they
are
seeking,
but
in
either
case,
we
submit,
preemption
is
inappropriate,
and
that
is
because
these
independent
laws
were
never
intended
by
congress
to
be
wiped
out
either
in
terms
of--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--it
would
not,
your
honor,
because
federal
law
only
refers
to
contract
disputes,
and
in
the
case
of
mr.
norris'
common
law
dispute,
that
is
not
based
on
the
contract.
we
are
looking
at
the
distinction
as
being
the
source
of
the
right
that
mr.
norris
is
pursuing,
so
insofar
as
mr.
norris
is
pursuing
a
right
independent
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
even
if
there
were
some
question
that
were
to
arise
under
a
contract
because
the
source
of
the
right
is
independent
of
the
contract,
that
particular
right
remains
adjudicable
in
a
court
and
need
not
go
through
the
rla
procedure.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
well,
the
state
obviously
could
not
come
into
conflict
with
direct
federal
law,
but
the
rla
does
not--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
could,
but
it
would
at
that
point
have
to
also
refer
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
if
there
was
one
that
applied
to
that
particular
provision.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
well,
for
example,
if
there
were
a
seniority
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
could
somehow
override
the
agreement
that
the
parties
had
come
into,
but
if--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--yes.
if
he
is
in
state
court
not
asserting
his
rights
under
the
contract
but
instead
asserting
his
rights
under
the
state
law,
yes,
he
could
then
go
into
state
court
and
proceed
in
that
way,
and
that's
exactly
what
ms.
lingle
did
in
the
lingle
case.
she
went
under
her
contract
and
she
pursued
her
remedies
there
and
in
fact
won
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
she
went
into
court
and
pursued
her
wrongful
termination
claim
there,
and
there
was
no
conflict
according
to
this
court,
even
though
she
was
proceeding
in
both
the
rla
forum
and
in
court,
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
no
reason
that
any
different
approach
should
be
applied
under
the
rla.
in
fact,
in
terms
of
preemption
procedures
the
cases
about
preemption
have
developed
in
parallel
lines
under
the
lmra
context
applicable
to
lingle
and
under
the
rla
context
applicable
here,
and
specifically
in
the
andrews
case,
which
held
that
for
contract
disputes
only,
the
exclusive
forum
was
an
rla
forum.
in
that
case,
this
court
referred
to
lmra
developments
in
preemption
law,
such
as
republic
steel
and
lucas
flour,
and
that
has
been
the
case
throughout
the
history
of
preemption
under
both
laws.
i
would
like
to
address
some
of
the
matters
that
came
up
in
my
opponent's
discussion.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
the
federal
railway
safety
act,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
he
has
completely
overlooked
the
inclusion
by
congress
of
an
election
of
remedies
provision
there,
so
that
even
though
it
applies
to
railroad
workers
and
not
to
airline
workers,
there
is
in
fact
retained
a
railroad
worker's
right
to
go
to
court,
if
in
fact
he
has
an
independent
state
right.
there
is
some
confusion,
the
reason
being
that
one
of
the
legislative
reports
that
has
been
cited
says
there
is
an
exclusive
remedy
under
the
rla,
but
that
is
because
the
legislative
report
apparently
was
from
a
bill
different
from
the
statute
that
was
actually
enacted.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
yes.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor,
because
then,
in
the
separate
state
court
action
brought
under
an
independent
law,
an
independent
determination
would
be
made
whether,
under
state
law,
there
had
been
a
wrongful
discharge
or
not,
and
different
considerations
would
come
into
play
irrespective
of
whatever
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
might
have
provided.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
it...
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
but
in
case
after
case
what
the
nrab
has
done
is
said,
we
are
confining
our
consideration
to
matters
of
contract,
and
they
refer
to
law
outside
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
only
if
that
law
is
expressly
incorporated
into
the
agreement,
or
if
it
serves
as
a
guide,
but
to
my
knowledge
you
have--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--yes.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
yes,
that's
correct,
because--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--there
is
no
effect,
we
submit,
and
the
reason
is
because
the
determination
of
whether
in
fact
he
was
discharged
that
was
made
by
an
adjustment
board
would
turn
on
provisions
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
whereas
when
he
came
into
court--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--yes.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
yes,
because
under
state
law
there
may
be--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--i
am
not
aware
of
any
case
directly
like
that,
where
in
fact,
exactly
contrary
results
were
found
by
an
adjustment
board
and
by
a
court,
but
the
reasoning
behind
it
is
that
the
rla
is
confined
to
that
world
that
we
have
discussed,
which
is
the
world--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--but
it
would
be
a
determination
made
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
based
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement's
determination
of
a
discharge.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
yes.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
presumably
the
same
result
would
be
reached.
not
necessarily
preclusion,
but
the
same
result
would
be
reached
if
the
two--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--if
this
court
were
to
rule
that
the
standards
are
exactly
the
same...
yes,
then
i
believe,
if
in
fact
there
were
that
determination,
there
would
be
a
preclusion.
in
this
case,
however--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
could
make
that
kind
of
determination.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
perhaps
there
would
be,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
we
don't
have
that.
we
don't
have
a
specific
whistleblower
protection
address...
or
even
on
the
discharge
issue
addressing
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
and
so
we
are
left
with
the
record
as
it
stands,
and
on
the
record
as
it
stands,
mr.
norris
has
evidentiary
differences
with
the
petitioners
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
discharged
at
all,
whether
or
not
that
discharge
was
proper,
and
we
submit
that
the
rla
does
not
require
those
evidentiary
differences
to
be
resolved
in
an
rla
forum,
so
that
he
remains
free
to
come
into
court.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
procedural
that
the
forum
preemption
issue
is
in
fact
that
is
what
petitioners
are
arguing
for.
if
they
are
arguing--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--thank
you.
if
in
fact
they
are
arguing
for
forum
preemption,
that
mr.
norris'
claim
is
required
to
go
to
an
rla
forum,
then
they
run
smack
up
against
decisions
by
this
court.
in
particular,
they
run
up
against
terminal
railroad,
which
was
a
case
brought
by
a
union
against
a
railroad
in
a
state
administrative
agency,
and
if
in
fact
there
were
forum
preemption,
then
at
the
outset
in
the
state
administrative
agency
there
should
have
been
preemption,
and
that
case
should
have
been
funneled
to
an
rla
forum.
that
didn't
happen,
the
case
came
to
this
court,
and
the
court
did
not
say
that
the
case
should
have
gone
to
an
rla
forum.
similarly--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor,
but
if
in
fact
there
were
forum
preemption
at
stake,
presumably
this
court
would
have
recognized
what
the
intent
of
con--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
and
also
he
runs
smack
up
against
buell,
which
was
an
independent
claim,
independent
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
permitted
to
go
through
the
judicial
procedure.
as
you
know,
petitioners
have
tried
to
distinguish
buell
on
the
ground
that
it
is
a
federal
law-based
claim,
but
there
is
no
reason
that
state
and
federal
laws
for
preemption
purposes
should
be
treated
differently.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
yes.
yes,
and
in
fact
this
court
has
said
that
they
should
be
treated
alike.
in
metropolitan
life
this
court
said
that,
and
again
in
lingle
this
court
said
that,
and
in
lingle,
in
saying
that,
this
court
cited
to
buell,
an
rla
case,
even
though
lingle
was
an
lmra
case.
in
addition,
petitioners
run
smack
up
against,
at
the
very
least,
a
constitutional
consideration
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
may
constitutionally
take
away
mr.
norris'
right
to
a
jury
trial.
we
will
concede
that
clearly,
had
he
brought
a
claim
under
the
contract,
there
would
be
a
public
right
in
having
the
rla
forum
handle
contract
claims
in
a
uniform
manner,
so
that
claim
clearly
would
go,
without
a
jury
trial,
to
the
rla
forum,
but
there
is
no
indication
of
an
equivalent
public
right
that
would
force
an
independent
state
law
claim
to
go
into
that
kind
of
forum,
so
at
the
very
least--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
a
seventh
amendment
argument,
your
honor.
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
decide
that
issue,
but
simply
to
take
into
consideration
that
petitioner's
argument,
if
accepted,
would
implicate
that
issue--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--he
was,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
our
position
is
that
in
the
way
that
this
is
working
what
is
happening
is,
if
you
take
away
the
jury
trial
you
are
funneling
all
claims,
including
state
and
federal
claims,
into
a
federal
forum.
that
is
a
nonjury
forum
into
an
rla
federal
forum,
so
to
that
extent
we
are
talking
about
creating
a
nonjury
federal
forum
that
is
not
a
jury
forum,
when--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--yes--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--it
violates
the
seventh
amendment
because
it
takes
away
the
right
to
jury
trial,
and
that
right
has
been
construed
as--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--our
submission
is
that
by
channeling
his
case
into
a
federal
forum
you
are
also
implicating
article
iii,
and
this
court
has
construed
seventh
amendment
concerns
as
being
on
the
same
standard
as
article
iii
concerns.
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
you
are
channeling
into
a
non-article
iii
forum
these
kinds
of
claims
that
traditionally
have
been
deemed
to
be
entitled
to
be
triable
in
court.
if,
for
example,
this
were
a
diversity
case,
so
that
it
was
brought
in
federal
court,
surely
mr.
norris
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
jury--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--our
position
is
that
in
those
cases,
if
the
court
is
taking
about
contract
rights,
then
there
is
an
overriding
public
right
that
permits
the
channeling
of
such
cases
into
an
rla
forum,
but
there
is
no
such
overriding
public
right
with
respect
to
state
based
rights,
differing
state
by
state,
and
certainly
not
in
the
congressional
intent.
all
that
petitioners
are
laying
their
weighty
argument
on
is
in
essence
the
word
rla,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
too
heavy
a
weight
to
place.
in
fact,
just
2
days
ago,
justice
stevens
read
the
decision
in
landgraf,
in
which
this
court
said
extraordinary
weight
should
not
be
placed
on
narrow
terms
in
a
long
and
complicated
statute,
and
we
submit
that
the
placement
of
such
weight
on
the
word
"or"
in
the
terms
arising
out
of
grievances,
or
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
contracts
is
much
too
great
a
weight--
ms.
susan
oki
mollway
--thank
you,
your
honor.
