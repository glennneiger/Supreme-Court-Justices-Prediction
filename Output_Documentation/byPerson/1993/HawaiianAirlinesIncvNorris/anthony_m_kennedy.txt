justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
let
me
try
this
one
more
time,
a
different
way.
suppose
that
before
this
employee
were
discharged
the
employer
came
to
you,
as
the
employer's
counsel,
and
said,
in
determining
whether
or
not
i
may
discharge
this
employee,
must
i
consult
and
be
guided
by
the
hawaii
whistleblower
statute?
what
would
be
your
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
talking
about
the
adjustment
board
process,
i'm
asking
whether
or
not
i
may...
i
must
take
account
of
that
statute
in
determining
whether
or
not
i
will
discharge
the
employee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
should
under
a
matter
of
law.
must
i,
as
a
matter
of
law?
