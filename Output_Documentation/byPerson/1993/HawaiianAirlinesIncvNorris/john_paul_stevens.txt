justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
you
started
to
respond
to
an
earlier
question
by
identifying
four
sources
of
law.
you've
got
the
agreement,
the
practices,
and
the
railway
act.
what's
the
fourth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
go
ahead.
i'm--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
the
third.
justice
john
paul
stevens
focusing
on
the
third
for
a
moment,
how
does
that
reconcile
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
if
the
two
states
have
different
policies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
does
not
have
a
federal
policy
counterpart?
supposing
in
hawaii
you
said
they
had
a
statute
that
said,
nobody
has
to
work
on
king
kamehameha's
birthday,
and
it's
just
hawaii
has
such
a
statute.
could
the
employer...
and
the
employer
made
the
man
work
on
that
birthday
and
fired
him...
or
fired
him
if
he
didn't,
something
like
that.
what
result
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
assume
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
silent
on
this
particular
holiday.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
change
it
just
a
little.
instead
of
saying...
instead
of
discharging
him,
they
just
didn't
pay
him
for
the
day.
they
docked
him
for
a
day's
pay,
and
there's
no
remedy
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
missing
a
day's
pay.
could
he
sue
in
state
court
and
get
the
day's
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
term
"grievances"
is
really
the
heart
of
the
dispute,
i
suppose,
whether
grievances
include
noncontractual
disputes
as
well
as
contractual
disputes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
contained
a
definition
of
discharge
that
was
not
complied
with.
i
mean,
so
that
under
an
agreement
there
was
no
discharge.
what
do
you
do
in
the
state
court
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would
mean
that
if
an
arbitrator
determined
there
was
a
discharge
within
the
meaning
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
would
not
necessarily
preclude
a
different
holding
in
the
state
court
on
the
same
issue
decided
under
a
different
standard.
