--maybe
you
can
make
your
example
specific
to
this
case,
and
this
would
be
my
question:
suppose
the
board
finds
that
norris
was
indeed
improperly
discharged.
at
that
point,
what
remedy
could
the
board
give?
would
there
be
any
room
for
the
state
whistleblower's
statute
in
the
remedy
that
the
board
could
give?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
finding
is
that
a
discharge
was
improper.
this
person
did
just
what
an
employee
should
do,
detecting
a
condition
that
might
make
flights
unsafe
for
passengers,
so
it's
a
complete
exoneration
of
what
he
did.
indeed,
the
board
concludes,
instead
of
being
disciplined,
he
should
have
gotten
a
medal.
therefore,
the
remedy
is...
and
what
could
the
remedy
be,
and
how
would
it
differ
from
a
state
law
remedy
under
the
whistleblower
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
withdrawing
what
you
said
earlier
about...
you
said
state
law
provides
a
floor,
state
law
policy
would
be
taken
into
account
by
the
board,
now
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
is
state
law
is
irrelevant.
indeed,
not
to
be...
positively
not
to
be
considered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
the
whistleblower
protection,
and
where
does
it
come
from...
case
law,
if
it
comes
from
statute
or...
you're
rejecting
the
hawaii
whistleblower
act
as
the
source
of
law.
what
is
the
source
of
the
whistleblower
protection
that
the
employee
would
get
before
the
board?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does...
well,
can
you
be
specific
about
what
the
collecting
bargaining
statute...
agreement
says
about
whistleblowers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
a
source
is
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
okay,
what
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
governs
whistleblower
protection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
norris,
in
his
state
lawsuit,
did
he
ask
for
punitive
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
he
get
those
under
the
grievance
board
proceeding,
assuming
every
fact
was
found
in
his
favor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
review
for
me
your
answer
of...
assuming
everything
was
found
in
his
favor,
what
could
the
remedy
be
from
the
board
and
how
would
it
differ
from
the
state
law
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--something
else
between
the
two,
for
exclusive
jurisdiction
but
applying
both
state
and
federal
law
and
substantive
preemption...
that
is,
to
the
extent
that
there
would
be
questions
and
comments
in
a
wrongful
discharge
before
the
board,
that
the
question
whether
norris
was
wrongfully
discharged
has
to
be
determined
by
the
board,
and
then
the
state
forum
can
take
over,
so
it's
kind
of
a
deference
until
the
board
decides
the
preliminary
question.
how
about
that?
would
that
be
a
way
of
harmonizing
state
and
federal
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
mentioned
the
prospect
of
someone
pursuing
relief
in
both
forums.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
in
the...
before
the
board,
the
board
determines
that
there
was
no
wrongful
discharge,
would
that
have
preclusive
effect
on
the
state
court
action
under
the
whistleblower's
protective
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
this
court
ever
make
that
determination
with
respect
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
hawaii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
recognize
any
kind
of
deference,
or
which
one
goes
first?
you've
answered
the
preclusion
question
differently.
if
the
board
goes
first,
it
would
bind
the
state
court.
but
here,
it
was
a
person
proceeding
in
both
forums
at
the
same
time.
does
the
state
have
any
obligation
to
defer,
to
hold
its
case
in
abeyance
while
the
board
answers
the
question,
was
there
a
wrongful
discharge?
