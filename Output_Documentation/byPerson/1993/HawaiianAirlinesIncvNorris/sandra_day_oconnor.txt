mr.
hipp,
you
seem
to
be
arguing
for
a
different
standard
under
the
rla
than
that
under
lingle
and
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i'm
not
sure...
how
do
you
justify
application
of
such
a
different
standard?
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
i
suppose
congress
didn't
intend
to
entirely
preempt
ordinary
state
laws,
even
in
the
transportation
industry,
having...
i
guess
we've
upheld
state
requirements
that
the
train
have
a
caboose,
and
one
thing
and
another,
and
so
obviously
we
have
said
there
is
room
for
application
of
state
law--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--even
under
the
rla.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
state
perhaps
could
arguably
have
made
a
conscious
decision,
by
the
passage
of
whistleblower
statutes,
that
this
is
a
means
of
assuring
public
safety.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
haven't
taken
it
out.
they've
added,
perhaps.
