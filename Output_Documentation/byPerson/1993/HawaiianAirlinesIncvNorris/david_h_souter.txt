justice
david
h.
souter
but
as
a
practical
matter,
could
the...
in
the
absence
of
a
state
law,
couldn't
the
board
do
exactly
the
same
thing?
it
would
simply
not
look
to
state
law
for
the
source
of
its
public
policy,
but
it
could
come
up
with
basically
the
same
standard,
couldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why,
then,
did
congress
add...
if
i'm
correct,
why
did
congress
add
a
whistleblower
provision
to
the
substantive
law
governing
rail
employees
but
not
airline
employees?
justice
david
h.
souter
on
your
theory,
wasn't
it
equally
redundant,
equally
unnecessary
with
respect
to
the
rail
employees?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
wouldn't
follow
from
that
that
they
would
come
out
the
same.
they
might
come
out
the
same,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
answer
the
chief's
question
by
saying
they
would.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
a
congressional...
of
a
congressional
act
applying
only
to
the
railroads.
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
you
doing
away
with
it
too,
because
you
are
telling
us
that
even
in
the
instances
in
which
there
is
a
preemption,
the
preemption
is
somehow
softened
by
this
obligation
to
borrow
standards,
or
to
borrow
principles?
you're
interfering
with
the
tradeoff
too,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
source
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
still
don't
understand
the
source
of
the
obligation
to
borrow
these
standards.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
isn't...
why
wouldn't
it
be
functioning
in
the
nature
of
the
court
for
the
board
to
say,
we
think
whistleblower
legislation
is
very
unwise,
and
we
are
not
going
to
recognize
any
grievance
whatsoever
that
has
as
its
source
a
whistleblower
claim.
is
that
open
to
the
board?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
want
to
know
how
the
review
turns
out.
can
the
board
say
that
in
a
grievance
arising
in
hawaii?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
if
a
state
is
willing
to
take
the
trouble
to
do
it,
can
a
state
enact,
therefore,
an
extremely
detailed
code
of
labor
management
relations
basically
covering
everything
that
is
normally
covered
in
cba's
and
therefore,
in
each
case,
simply
be
enforcing
a
substantive
state...
the
employee
who
might
sue
under
it
would
in
each
case
simply
be
enforcing
a
substantive
state
law
right
and
therefore
ignore
the
cba
entirely?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
it
basically
enacts
what
as
a
practical
matter
is
a
parallel
regime
to
the
most
salient
provisions
of
most
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
one
that
is
entirely
in
harmony,
can
it
therefore,
in
effect,
provide
on
each
really
serious
issue
an
alternate
forum
if
it
has
a
sufficiently
detailed
law
to
address
each
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
that
the
state
statute
was
simply
in
harmony
with
it.
could
the
employee
begin,
and
if
he
does
not
like
the
way
the
arbitration
is
going,
basically
drop
it
and
then
simply
walk
into
a
state
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
determination
of
fact
is
that
he
wasn't
fired,
and
if
he
wasn't
fired,
a
fortiori
he
wasn't
fired
for
whistleblowing.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
fired
or
discharge
might
mean
something
different
under
state
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
didn't
mean
something
different
under
state
law,
there
would
be
preclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
you
said
there
wasn't
preclusion
because
the
standards
might
be
different.
if
we
determine
the
standards
are
the
same,
why
wouldn't
there
be
preclusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
could.
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
could
say
we...
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
told
us
what
discharge
means
for
federal
purposes
and
our
definition
is
the
same,
and
if
they
did
that,
there
would
be
an
obligation
to
recognize
an
estoppel,
wouldn't
there?
