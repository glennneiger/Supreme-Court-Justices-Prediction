mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
scope
of
the
minor
dispute
resolution
procedure
of
the
railway
labor
act,
and
whether
an
airline
employee
can
abandon
that
procedure
and
go
to
state
court
with
a
state
tort
claim
of
wrongful
discharge.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
congress,
in
establishing
the
railway
labor
act,
set
up
a
comprehensive,
indeed,
pioneering
alternative
dispute
resolution
procedure
for
adjusting
minor
disputes
between
employees
and
employers
without
lawsuits
and
without
strikes.
furthermore,
as
all
the
parties
in
this
case
accept,
the
minor
dispute
resolution
procedure
within
the
railway
labor
act,
section
204,
must
go
through
the
mandatory
arbitration
procedures
of
the
adjustment
board
in
the
absence
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
congressional
act.
where
we
part
company
with
the
hawaii
court,
with
the
respondent,
and
with
the
solicitor
general
is
in
defining
the
scope
of
the
jurisdictional
language
of
section
204.
in
our
view,
and
as
we
have
argued
at
length
in
our
brief,
our
opponent's
positions
concerning
the
scope
of
section
204
are
flawed
because
they
attempt
to
rewrite
the
plain
language
of
section
204
and
other
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act,
and
they
misconstrue
the
railway
labor
act's
legislative
history
and
this
court's
decisions
interpreting
the
rla.
if
this
court
were
to
accept
our
opponent's
views,
the
result
would
greatly
undermine
congress'
scheme
for
resolving
employment
disputes,
and
it
would
do
that
by
undercutting
the
historic
legislative
tradeoff
that
took
place
in
1934,
whereby
unions
and
employees
achieved
the
mandatory
arbitration
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
return
for
giving
up
their
right
to
go
to
court
and
their
right
to
strike.
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
chicago
river
and
indiana
railroad
case,
that
tradeoff
was
fundamental
to
the
1934
amendments
to
the
rla
prior
to
the
enactment
in
1936
of
section
204.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
your
honor,
the
touchstone
for
preemption,
as
in
fact
the
court
recognized
in
lingle,
is
not
to
apply
some
procrustean
approach,
but
instead
to
look
at
the
purposes
of
congress
in
each
scheme.
what
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
section
301?
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
assure
common
interpretation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
pursuant
to
federal
common
law.
there's
no
mention
of
alternative
dispute
resolution
there.
there's
no
mention
of
any
arbitral
forum
there.
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act?
the
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act
is
to
provide
a
method,
a
comprehensive
method
for
resolving
disputes
between
employers
and
employees.
if
you
look
at
section
2
first
of
the
railway
labor
act,
congress
has
made
the
determination
that
it
is
these
kinds
of
disputes
between
employers
and
employees
that
leads
to
disruption
of
interstate
commerce,
therefore
congress
set
up,
in
section
3
first
(i)
for
the
railroad
industry
and
in
section
204
for
the
airline
industry,
a
method
for
resolving
those
disputes.
the
method
is
an
arbitral
or
adjustment
board
method,
and
a
scope
of
jurisdiction
is
stated
there.
it
is
a
congressional
scope
of
jurisdiction.
therefore,
unlike
lingle,
which
addresses
congress'
concerns
related
to
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
congress
had
a
different
agenda
in
204
and
3
first
(i).
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
because
you
must
address
the
congressional
purposes
of
the
rla.
the
rla
was
designed
to
deal
with
disputes
between
employees
and
employers.
it
was
not
designed
to
deal
with
whether
or
not
a
state
established
a
minimum
substantive
standard
such
as
a
caboose.
if
you
have
a
regulatory
agency
in
a
state
that
says...
and
the
state
makes
the
determination
through
its
legislative
process
that
state
may
have
a
caboose
law,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
they
can
make
that
determination,
but
what
they
cannot
do,
your
honor...
and
this
is
what
the
andrews
case
in
essence
holds...
is
that
they
cannot
take
a
dispute
between
an
employee
and
an
employer
in
the
airline
or
railroad
industry
and
convert
that
dispute
into
a
state
law
claim,
taking
it
out
of
the
adjustment
board
process.
why
not?
why
can't
they
do
that?
because
congress
recognized--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--well,
this
raises
the
specter,
again,
of
what
happened
when
this
court
in
the
moore
case
years
ago
established
this
concurrent
jurisdiction
concept,
whereby
you
could
go
both
to
state
court,
and
you
could
go
to
the
adjustment
board
procedure.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
the
state
law
does
not
exist
in
the
situation
where
there's
a
dispute
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
covered
by
these
mandatory
adjustment
board--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
it
is
effective,
correct.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it
is
preempted.
if
your
question,
your
honor,
is
directed
at
the
question
of
what
the
adjustment
board
looks
at,
the
substance--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--the
state
law--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--yes,
your
honor,
it
can,
depending
upon
whether
or
not
it
is
regulating
a
dispute
between
the
employer
and
the
employee,
on
the
one
hand,
or
if
it
is
establishing
substantive
minimum
standards.
perhaps
i
can
give
you
an
example
that
would
clear
this
up.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
well,
your
honor,
let's
make
this
clear,
because
it
is--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--the
board
would
be
free
to
fashion
a
remedy
to
deal
with
the
finding
that
it
made.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
the
remedy
would
be
left
open
to
the
adjustment
board
to
establish,
and
that
remedy
would
take
into
account
the
state
public
policies
in
establishing
whatever
remedy
the
adjustment
board
wanted.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
that
is
a--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--well,
it
was
only
addressing
the
railroad
side
of
the
equation
in
the--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--yes,
your
honor,
except
for
one
thing.
what
is
clear
under
the
federal
rail
safety
act
is
a
specific
punitive
damage
remedy
is
included
under
that
of
$20,000.
therefore,
there
is
a
direction
by
congress
as
to
how
you
should
be
formulating
your
remedy,
and
it's
important
that
you
understand,
particularly
in
dealing
with
the
arguments
by
my
opponents
here,
that
under
the
federal
rail
safety
act,
nonunion
employees
are
committed
to
adjustment
board
jurisdiction.
so
that
even
in
the
absence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
those
employees
go
through
the
adjustment
board
procedure
for
resolution
of
their
claim,
and
this
is
why
i
need
to
address,
if
you
don't
mind,
justice
scalia's
point,
because
i
think
it's
a
fundamental
point
here,
and
that
is,
what
is
the
source
of
the
law,
the
substantive
law
that
an
adjustment
board
looks
at?
what
did
congress
intend
about
that,
because
it
deals
with
the
complex
questions,
including
the
seventh
amendment
question
that
is
presented
here.
if
all
congress
had
said
was,
you
take
state
law
claims,
and
you
move
them
over
to
an
adjustment
board
process,
then
you
would
have
a
problem
with
regard
to
a
right
to
jury
trial,
but
that
is
not
what
congress
said.
congress
said,
we
want
disputes,
grievances,
if
you
will,
which
are
identified
to
include
discharges,
to
be
resolved
by
an
adjustment
board,
and
the
adjustment
board...
and
this
court
recognized
this
in
burley,
by
the
way,
and
i
will
refer
to
footnote
36
of
burley,
for
exactly
the
problem
that
you
presented,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--okay,
in
that
particular
grievance
he
has
been
disciplined
in
some
way,
as
you've
just
described.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
correct,
and
now--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--so
now
the
question
is
that
there's
a
dispute
between
the
employee
and
the
employer.
that's
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act,
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
substantive
law
that
is
going
to
be
applied
by
the
adjustment
board
in
that--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--state
law--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--well,
state
law
provides
the
floor
upon
which
the
adjustment
board
has
to
function.
there's
a
difference,
of
course,
between
taking
into
account
state
law
policy
and
requirements
and
not
rejecting
those.
that's
in
essence
what
you've
looked
at
in
the
misco
case.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
no,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
this
is
exactly...
this
is
my
point,
and
that
is,
the
adjustment
board
was
established
by
congress,
and
you'll
see
this
in
representative
crosser's
statements
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act:
to
act
like
a
court,
to
make
the
kinds
of
judgments
based
upon
a
range
of
policy
considerations.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
the
state
law
may
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
it
is
not
arbitrary,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
well,
and
the--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--well,
certainly
it
would
be
treated
to
provide
under
our
contract,
because
it
states
that
an
employee
cannot
be
disciplined
for
refusal
to
perform
work
in
violation
of
federal
or
state
safety
laws,
to
provide
a
floor
at
whatever
the
state
safety
law
mandated,
but
it
would
be
up
to...
and
there
could
be
inconsistencies.
let's
give
you
an
example.
this
was
one
of
the
things
congress
addressed
when
it
was
looking
at
the
right
to
work
laws.
what
if
you
have
a
state
law
that
said,
you
have
to
sign
off...
you
have
to
become
a
union
member,
and
then
you
have
another
state
law
that
says,
no,
you
have
a
right
to
work
here,
and
you
cannot
require
somebody
to
become
a
union
member.
there's
a
conflict
there.
well,
congress
dealt
with
that
in
an
explicit
fashion
by
saying
we're
not
going
to
apply
these
particular
kinds
of
laws
across
state
lines,
but
when
you
look,
and
in
particular
you
look
at
burley,
when
it
talks
about
what
the
nature
of
the
substantive
considerations
are
at
the
adjustment
board
level,
here's
what
they
say
in
burley:
depending
upon
the
substantive
character
of
the
claim,
its
foundation
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
otherwise,
and
other
factors,
that
that
will
determine
how
the
adjustment
board
comes
out.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
they
would
no
doubt
come
out
the
same.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
well,
in
the
context
of
a
dispute
between
an
employer
and
an
employee,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
no,
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg,
if
that's
what
i
suggested.
i
believe
the
chief
justice
asked
me
if
those
cases
would
come
out
the
same.
i
believe
that
the
cases
would
come
out
the
same,
and
congress
believed
these
cases
would
come
out
the
same,
because
it
recognized
specifically
with
regard
to
the
whistleblowing
situation
the
background
in
the
adjustment
boards
of
dealing
with
these
whistleblower
claims.
therefore,
since
congress
has
already
recognized
that
the
adjustment
boards
deal
with
these
whistleblower
claims,
i
am
assuming
that
the
employee
will
get
the
benefit
of
the
whistleblower
protection,
and
where
the--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--the
source
comes
from
four
different
locations.
one
source
is
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
another
source
is
the
practice
and
procedures
of
the
parties
with
regard
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
a
third
source--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--i'm
sorry,
what
the
collective
bargaining--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--in
particular,
there's
a
just
cause
provision
in
the
contract
that
prohibits
employees
from
being
terminated
for
just
cause.
it
also
protects
employees
from
refusing
to
sign
off
on
work
performed
in
violation
of
state
or
federal
laws,
safety
laws.
that's--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--my
answer
would
be
that
you
may
not
do
anything
in
your
adjustment
board
process
that
would
reject
the
policies
in
the
hawaii
whistleblower
protection
statute.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
my
answer
would
be
that
you
should
take
into
account
the
policies
under
that
statute
and...
in
deciding
whether--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--that
you
must.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
because
in
one
you
have
provided
a
floor.
in
the
other,
you
have
not...
if
the
nevada
case
had
stated,
your
honor,
that
you
are
permitted,
in
fact
mandated
to
terminate
people
for
whistleblowing,
then
there
would
be
a
conflict.
if
the
nevada
case
as
you
posited
it
says
nothing,
then
the
hawaii
case
provides
the
floor.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
the
sources
arise
in
the
contract,
in
the
practice
and
procedures
of
the
party,
in
the
federal
rail
safety
act...
it
is
also...
is
a
source.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
well,
certainly
the
policies
involved
would
be
carried
over.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
my
response
is
that
the
policies
would
carry
over
because
congress,
in
the
legislative
history
which
we
cited
for
you,
states
very
specifically
that
it
understands
that
this
same
protection
is
provided
through
the
adjustment
board
process.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
and...
the
agreement,
the
practices,
the
state...
the
policies
under
state
and
federal
substantive
laws,
the
policies
involved,
and
that's
through
a
misco
analysis--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--and
finally--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--that
was
the
third
one.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
and
then
the
finally
is
the
federal
rail
safety
act
provides
explicit
jurisdiction,
even
for
nonunion
employees
in
the
rail
line...
railroad
industry.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
as
long
as
they
don't
have
conflicting
policies,
then
whatever
the
adjustment
board
decides
upon,
it
would
take
into
account
the
policies
involved
and
establish
a
floor
for
the
employees.
this,
of
course,
is
nothing
new.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
well,
certainly
with
regard
to
the
specific
whistleblowing
question
i
think
we
can,
by
reference
to
what
congress
has
said
it
understands
to
be
done
in
the
adjustment
boards
already.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
in...
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
rail
safety
act.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
was
speaking
about
adjustment
board
process,
and
what
they
took
into
account,
and
the
adjustment
board
scope
of
jurisdiction
in
the
airline
and
railroad
industries
are
coextensive.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
in
that
case--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--all
right.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
employee
would
have
to
be
reinstated.
why...
and
let
me
tell
you...
explain
why,
because
that's
a
good
hypothetical.
the
reason
that
that
would
work
that
way
is
that
you
have
a
state
minimum
standard
that
is
established,
correct,
namely,
every
employee
will
be
off
on
king
kamehameha
day.
the
employer
is,
as
we
know
pursuant
to
the
terminal
case,
has
to
abide
by
the
state
substantive
standards.
now,
as
to...
after
you
have
that
substantive
standard,
if
you
terminate
an
employee
in
violation
of
that
substantive
standard,
you
will
have
violated
a
policy
pursuant
to
state
law.
that
policy
is
incorporated
in
the
complex
that
the
adjustment
board
must
evaluate
in
deciding
the
discharge
case.
let's...
your...
let's
carry
your
hypothetical
out,
because
if
you
go
to
the
adjust--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--no,
he
could
not,
your
honor.
your
assumption
here
is
that...
you
assumed
the
answer
in
your
question,
namely
that
there
would
be
no
remedy
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
congress
dictated
that
there
would
be
a
remedy
for
that
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
because
congress
said
there
has
to
be
an
adjustment
board,
and
congress
said
that
that
adjustment
board
has
to
consider
grievances,
and
if
you
would
look
at
how
the
development
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
in
the
first
10
years,
and
you
look
in
particular--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
would
really
ask--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--that
they--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--and
if
by
that
case,
it
was
the
wage
payment
situation--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--that's
correct,
your
honor--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--they...
not
the
same
remedy.
this
was
the
debate
between
the
majority
in
andrews
and
justice
douglas,
because
justice
douglas
kept
saying,
under
state
law
you
get
this
additional
remedy.
you
get
all
of
these
good
remedies
under
state
law
that
you're
not
going
to
get
under
the
adjustment
board,
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
that
is
not
what
preemption
is
all
about.
that
preemption
allows
the
adjustment
board
to
fashion
the
remedy.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
professor
garrison's
article,
and
particularly...
it's
cited
many
times
by
this
court,
because
it
was
written
in
1937,
after
10
years
of
experience
under
the
railway
labor
act.
at
pages
583
and
586
of
that
article,
the...
dean
garrison
describes...
he
describes
how
the
adjustment
boards
had
been
dealing
with
grievances.
he
identified
grievances
as
a
narrow
class
of
cases
that
he
identified
as
being
discharges
or
refusals
to
promote.
if
you
look
at
the
analytical
framework
that
was
being
used
by
the
adjustment
board,
he
distinguishes
how
the
adjustment
board
addressed
those
cases
and
how
it
addressed
contract
interpretation
cases.
he
said
that
in
those
cases,
the
adjustment
board
looked
at
the
equities.
the
adjust--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
the
hawaii
court
found
that
he
could
not.
the
arbitrator,
who
is
the
only
arbitrator
who
has
testified
in
this
case,
said
that
under
certain
limited
circumstances
punitive
damages
would
be
available.
however,
i
would
also
hasten
to
note,
justice
ginsburg,
that
this
again
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
debate
between
justice
douglas
and
the
rest
of
the
court
in
the
andrews
case,
because
he
was
focusing
on
the
remedy
provided
by
state
law,
and
he
was
saying,
look,
you
can't
get
the
same
remedy
over
here
in
this
railway
labor
act
proceeding,
and
that
was
not
a
basis
for
not
finding
preemption.
you
have
to
understand--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--your
honor,
that
is
addressed
at
length
by
the
arbitrator
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
arbitrator
takes
one
position.
the
hawaii
courts
found
that
there
would
not
be
anything
other
than
back
pay
and
the
traditional
status
quo
ante
remedy.
the
hawaii
whistleblower
protection
act
itself
provides
for
the
payment
of
back
pay
plus
actual
damages.
that's
the
terminology
that's
used
there.
the
hawaii
whistleblower
protection
act,
according
to
the
state
court
judge,
does
not
provide
for
punitive
damages.
however,
the
plaintiff
has
sued
for...
in
common
law
and
asked
for
punitive
damages.
i
would
like
to
make
two
final
points
here,
and
i
think
they
are
key,
and
that
is
that
what
in
essence
is
being
asked
of
the
opponents
in
this
case
is
for
you
to
do
away
with
the
tradeoff
that
took
place
in
1934,
whereby
employees
got
their
mandatory
arbitration
procedures
and
they
gave
up
strikes,
and
going
to
court.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
this
is
exactly
what
was
entailed,
that--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--if
you
look
at
the
adjustment--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--the
source
of
the
obligation
is
for
the
court
to...
i
mean,
for
the
adjustment
board
to
function
in
the
nature
of
a
court,
to
look
at
and
draw
upon
the
policies--
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
--if
the
board...
the
board
might
well
say
that.
that
would
be
subject
to
review
in
the
courts
under
this
court's
misco
standard.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
i
would
say
that
it
could
not
say
that.
mr.
kenneth
b.
hipp
and
the
reason
i
would
say
that,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
has
recognized
already
that
this
has
to
be
dealt
with
through
the
adjustment
board
process.
