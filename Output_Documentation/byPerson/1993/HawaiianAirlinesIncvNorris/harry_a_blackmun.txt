justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii.
the
respondent,
norris,
lost
his
job
as
an
aircraft
mechanic
with
the
petitioner,
hawaiian
airlines
when
he
refused
to
sign
a
maintenance
record
for
a
plane
he
considered
unsafe.
he
brought
separate
state
court
suits
against
the
airline
and
its
officers
in
which,
he
alleged
wrongful
discharge
in
violation
of
public
policy
expressed
in
federal
statutes.
the
state
court
dismissed
these
tort
claims
as
preempted
by
the
railway
labor
act.
the
state
supreme
court
reversed
rejecting
petitioner's
claim
of
preemption.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment
and
hold
that
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
preempt
respondent's
state
law
causes
of
action.
the
court
is
unanimous
on
this
one.
