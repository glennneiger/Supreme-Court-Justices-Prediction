mr.
richard
h.
seamon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
some
of
the
issues
that
came
up
earlier
in
the
argument.
first,
we
would
part
company
with
our
colleagues
on
the
issue
of
preclusion.
we
would
say
that
when
a
factual
issue
is
arbitrated
and
goes
through
to
an
award,
that
under
utah
mining
and
similar
precedent
the
normal
rules
of
administrative
res
judicata
would
apply.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
related
to
that,
which
is,
we
believe
that
what
an
arbitrator,
or
what
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
can
decide
under
the
rla
are
grievances,
and
we
believe
that
the
term
grievances,
by
and
large,
includes
claims
based
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
to
the
extent
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
actually
incorporates
state
law,
then
it
may
well
be
that
the
arbitrator
can
look
to
state
law,
but
his
or
her
authority
to
do
so
is
solely
bounded
by
the
terms
of
the
contract,
and
that
is
because,
again,
the
term
grievances
really
embraces
claims
based
on
the
employment
contract.
the
third
point
i
would
like
to
make
has
to
do
with
the
hypothetical
that
arose
with
respect
to
whether
a
state
could
effectively
enact
a
comprehensive
labor
code
that
would
address
virtually
all
of
the
subjects
that
would
be
covered
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
to
a
large
extent
depends
on
whether
the
state
was
attempting
to
regulate
the
collective
bargaining
process
on
the
one
hand,
in
which
case
we
think
that
it
would
severely
limited
by
doing
so,
because
that
is
what
the
rla
deals
with.
that's
on
the
one
hand.
the
other
hand
is
that
a
state
still
remains
free
to
govern...
to
regulate
about
substantive
matters
of
employee
safety,
to
set
minimal
standards
of
protection.
again,
one
of
the
points
that
ms.
mollway
made,
and
this
court
has
made,
is
that
the
rla
governs
the
process
for
arriving
at
an
agreement
rather
than
the
substantive
terms
that
end
up
in
the
agreement
that's--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
can
cover
wages
as
well.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
there
may
be
other
federal
statutes
and
supremacy
clause
problems
at
the
margins,
but
as
far
as
the
rla
is
concerned,
the
answer
is
yes,
substantive
matters
such
as
wages.
the
next
point
is
also
related
to
the
question
about
what
a
state
can
regulate
without
running
afoul
of
the
rla
and
the
process
for
arbitrating
minor
grievances,
and
that
is
that
our
opponents
try
to
make
a
distinction
between
disputes
that
arise
in
the
employment
setting
and
safety
issues,
but
in
fact
the
two
are
often
related.
in
the
caboose
case,
for
example,
the
whole
dispute
began
when
employees
of
a
railroad
sought
to
have
cabooses
added
to
trains,
even
though
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
that
case
didn't
provide
for
the
cabooses
that
the
state
law
provided
for.
in
other
words,
that
was
a
dispute,
but
it
was
also
a
safety
issue.
in
that
case,
the
state
had
determined
that
there
were
a
minimal
number
of
cabooses
that
had
to
be
added
to
trains
even
though
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
that
case
provided
for
a
fewer
number,
so
in
reality
the
distinction
that
our
opponents
try
to
draw
between
safety
matters
on
the
one
hand
and
employment
disputes
on
the
other
hand
doesn't
really
exist.
and
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
with
respect
to
issues
that
arose
prior
in
the
argument
has
to
do
with
the
seventh
amendment,
and
we
would
say
that
ultimately
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
the
seventh
amendment
applies.
we
think
the
difficulty
of
making
a
seventh
amendment
argument
with
respect
to
our
colleagues
is
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
seventh
amendment
applies
to
actions
in
the
state
court.
it
only
applies
to
federal
court
actions,
and
for
that
reason
we
doubt
that
a
serious
seventh
amendment
problem
was
raised
here.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right,
but
a
diversity
action
would
go
forward
in
federal
court,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
proceeding
was
in
a
court
of
the
united
states
then
the
seventh
amendment
would
clearly
apply.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right,
and...
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i
think
the
more
important
point,
and
it
is
important
in
interpreting
congress'
intent,
is
that
even
if
a
person
doesn't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
state
court,
it's
nonetheless
an
important
and
valuable
right,
and
so
in
interpreting
the
rla,
the
court
should
consider
whether
congress
intended
to
extinguish
this
valuable
right
either
by
totally
extinguishing
the
state's
substantive
right,
or
extinguishing
the
right
to
a
state
forum.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
don't
believe
that
it
has
an
obligation
to
do
so,
although
we
would
certainly
think
that
in
certain
cases
it
would
be
prudent,
and
that
the
state
court
could,
without
running
afoul
of
either
the
plaintiff's
rights
or
the
rla,
defer
to
arbitration.
in
other
words--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
believe
that's
so,
and
there...
and
that
is
where
the
problem
of
deferral
becomes
important,
and
we
think
that...
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
rla
itself,
of
its
own
force,
would
require
a
state
court
to
basically
defer
or
stay
proceedings
pending
the
outcome
of
arbitration,
at
least
as
long
as
the
plaintiff's
claim
does
not
depend
on
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we're
basically
positing
an
either-or
situation.
either
the
claim
can
be
brought
in
state
court,
and
we
think
that
respondent's
claim
here
can
be
brought
in
state
court
because
it
doesn't
depend
on
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
or
it
has
to
be
brought
in
arbitration,
and
that
would
be
because
the
claim
requires
some
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
isn't
so
here.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well,
in
this
case
that
issue
doesn't
arise
because
the
respondent
was
very
clearly
discharged
after
the
step
1
hearing,
but
in
general
the
question
of
whether
a
discharge
occurs
under...
for
hawaii
whistleblower
protection
purposes
is
a
question
of
state
law.
if
it's
independent--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct.
the
only...
the
preclusion
would
attach
only
to
factual
findings,
historical
matters
for
example,
and
i
should
actually
qualify
my
point
about
preclusion
by
saying
that
certainly,
in
deciding
whether
a
finding
about
a
historical
fact
of
an
arbitrator
was
entitled
to
preclusive
effect,
a
court
should
take
into
account
the
procedures
that
the
arbitrator
followed.
i
mean,
obviously,
again,
in
accordance
with
utah
mining
construction
company
principles,
the
extent
to
which
the
arbitral
proceeding
resembled
judicial
sorts
of
proceedings
would
be
important
in
deciding--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
are
representing
the
views
of
the
united
states,
not
one
specific
agency
such
as
the
nrab,
or
the
nmb.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
presentation.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
thank
the
court.
