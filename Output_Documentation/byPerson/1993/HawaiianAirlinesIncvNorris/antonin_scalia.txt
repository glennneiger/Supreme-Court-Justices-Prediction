justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
buell,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you're
not
arguing
that
the
rla
preempts
state
law
at
all.
it's
not
a
preemption
claim
you're
making
at
all.
it's
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
claim.
you're
saying
state
law
applies,
but
it
has
to
be
applied
through
the
arbitration
procedure
of
the
rla,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
correct.
you're
saying
state
law
is
preempted,
so
the
state
law
does
not
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
the
dispute
concerns
an
issue
of
state
law,
there
no
longer
is
a
dispute,
so
you
don't
have
to
go
to
arbitration,
then.
you
say
the
state
law
is
ineffective,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
effective.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it's
not
preempted.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
state
law
apply?
is
the
state
law
applicable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
the
employment
relationship?
can
the
state
law
govern
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
really
confused.
i
had
thought
you
were
making
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
claim,
that
you
apply
the
state
law
but
it's
to
be
applied
by
the
board
through
the
arbitration.
now
you're
telling
me
no,
that
the
state
law
is
preempted.
that's
a
quite
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
grievance,
it
seems
to
me,
unless
state
law
applies.
let's
assume
that
there's
no
federal
whistleblower
statute.
there
is
a
state
whistleblower
statute.
the
employee
is
dismissed,
claims
it's
in
violation
of
the
state
statute,
so
he
brings
a
grievance.
why
is
there
a
grievance,
if
state
law
does
not
govern?
what
does
he
have
to
grieve
about?
you're
telling
me
state
law
does
not
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
he
says,
this
disciplining
is
in
violation
of
state
law,
isn't
he
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
not
in
violation
of
state
law,
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
dispute,
unless
you
posit
the
applicability
of
state
law.
there
is
no
dispute.
the
only
basis
for
his
claim
is
that
state
law
governs.
if
you
tell
me
state
law
doesn't
govern,
there's
no
dispute.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
claiming
that
he
has
a
federal
right
to
whistleblower
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
congress
say
that?
well,
but
that's--
--where
did
congress
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
they
must
provide
relief
in
that
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
must.
the
adjustment
board
must
provide
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
holiday
case,
right,
but
they
need
not
provide
it
in
the
whistleblower
case.
just,
they
may.
they
may
take
it
into
account,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
must
provide
it
in
the
whistleblower
case,
too,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
relief
that
the
state
requires.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
there's
a
federal
whistleblower
law
that's
applicable
to
railroad
workers?
would
that
be
applied
by
the
board?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
suppose
the
grievance
before
the
board
is...
there's
a
dispute
over
whether
he
was
fired
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
employer
says,
i
didn't
fire
you.
you
were
welcome
to
come
back
to
work,
and
he
said,
oh,
no
you
fired
me...
that's
the
dispute...
and
it
goes
to
arbitration
before
the
board,
and
the
board
says,
he
was
not
fired.
you're
saying
that
that
is
not
binding
on
the
state
court,
when
he
brings
a
whistleblower
suit
in
state
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
extraordinary,
to
have
no
collateral
estoppel
effect
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
same
fact.
the
fact
is
whether
he
was
free
to
come
back
to
work
or
not.
that
very
same
fact
is
going
to
be
at
issue
in
the
state
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying,
even
though
it's
already
been
adjudicated
in
a
proceeding
between
these
two,
it
will
be
readjudicated
by
the
state
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
precedent
for
that
in
any
other
area?
do
you
know
any
other
area
where
we
allow
that
to
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
like
that
one
better.
i
think
that's
a
good
forum.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
a
fortiori,
wouldn't
you?
if
they
should
be
treated
differently,
you
would
give
more
deference
to
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
just
safety?
why
not
wages?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
terms
of
employment.
you're
saying
that
states
can
control
the
mandatory
terms
of
an
employment
agreement
under
the
rla.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
these,
if
you
had
diversity,
you
could
be
in
a
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true,
but
her
point
is
that
by
excluding
that
course,
by
requiring
you
to
go
through
the
arbitration
mechanism,
you
deprive
the
plaintiff
of
that
option
of
getting
a
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
a
possible
argument.
you're
just
not
going
along
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
the
state
court
be
bound
by
factual
findings
in
the
arbitration?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
would
the
arbitration
panel
be
bound
by
factual
findings
in
the
state
proceeding
if
that
terminated
first?
