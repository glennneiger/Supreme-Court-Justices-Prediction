chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
92-2058,
hawaiian
airlines
v.
grant
norris.
mr.
hipp.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
really
gossamer
distinction,
it
seems
to
me.
are
you
saying
that...
supposing
this
case...
we
have
this
case
coming
up
in
hawaii,
which
has
a
whistleblower
protection
statute.
supposing
you
have
an
identical
facts
case
coming
up
from,
let's
say,
nevada,
which
doesn't
have
a
state
whistleblower
protection
statute.
now,
must
the
adjustment
board
handle
these
two
cases
differently?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
i
take
it
from
what
you've
just
said
that
among
those
policy
considerations
is
not
the
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
just
totally
arbitrary,
then,
on
the
part
of
the
adjustment
board?
it
may,
it
may
not,
it
could
do
lots
of
different
things,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
do
any?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then...
but...
it
seems
to
me
every
time
you've
been
asked
you've
said,
well,
it
could
be,
but
it
doesn't
have
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
why
would
the
nevada
and
hawaii
cases
be
treated
either
(a)
differently,
or
(b)
the
same?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
frankly
seems
to
me
to
be
almost
so
vague
that
you
can't
put
your
finger
on
anything.
do
the
cases
from
nevada
and
hawaii
come
out
differently
before
the
adjustment
board,
or
do
they
come
out
the
same?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
hawaii
has
a
statute
and
nevada
doesn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then,
the
state
law
must
be
virtually
nonexistent.
it
must
be
entirely
preemptive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
the
nevada
and
hawaii
cases
come
out
the
same?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
are
other
sources
for
whistleblower
protection
other
than
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
are
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
board
would...
even
though
the
federal
rail
safety
act
applies
only
to
railroads
and
not
to
airlines,
the
board
would
simply
carry
it
over?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why?
why?
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
congress
passes
a
law
saying,
here's
a...
we
want
this
law
to
apply
to
railroads,
and
the
board
says
well,
we'll
apply
it
not
only
to
railroads,
we'll
apply
it
to
airlines,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hipp.
ms.
mollway,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
were
to
prevail
in
this
case,
ms.
mollway,
we
would
have
to
cut
back
some
on
the
burley
opinion,
would
we
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
argument
made
in
terminal
railroad
that
it
should
have,
and
the
court
expressly
rejected
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
gives
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
is
the
constitutional
argument
you're
making?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
seventh
amendment
requires
jury
trials
and
certain
civil
actions
in
the
federal
courts.
i
thought
your
client
was
suing
in
a
hawaii
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
seventh
amendment
has
never
been
held
applicable
to
state
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
constitutional...
it
violates
the
seventh
amendment
to
do
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--because--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
right
to
jury
trial,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
take
away
the
right
to
jury
trial
of
any
federal
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
is
one
implicating
article
iii
by
doing
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
make
that
same
argument
about
a
great
deal
of
our
national
labor
relations
act
preemption
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mollway.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
seamon,
are
you
representing
simply
the
solicitor
general
here,
or
the
views
of
the
national...
nrab?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-2058,
hawaiian
airline
versus
norris
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
