mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
counsel,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think,
initially,
i
should
point
out
that
it
has
never
been
the
position
of
the
state
of
california
that
we
took
the
action
that
we
took
in
this
particular
case
because
we
were
precluded
by
federal
law.
we
took
the
position
that
we
took
in
this
particular
case
because
the
labor
commissioner,
and
the
courts
in
the
state
of
california,
are
precluded
by
state
law
from
taking
that
action.
state
law
has...
as
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
has
a
provision
in
the
posner
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
and
that
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
word
22
of
our
brief:
"any
controversy
under
a
collective
bargaining
contract
which
requires,
first,
a
determination
that
the
contract
does
or
does
not
define
the
rights
or
duties
of
the
parties
in
an
existing
situation
as
subject
to
arbitration,
if
the
agreement
provides
for
the
arbitration
of
the
disputes
that
arise
out
of
that
contract.
"
here,
the
right
and
the
duty
are
found
in
labor
code
section
203.
this
is
a
remedy
section.
the
right
to
recover
those
wage...
the
right
to
the
penalty,
which,
as
set
out
in
the
statute,
is
a
penalty
where
it
says
that
the
wage
rate
is
to
continue.
in
order
to
determine
the
wage
rate,
we
have
to
look
to
the
contract,
because
it's
the
right
of
the
employee
to
receive
that
wage
rate.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
it
would--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
in
our
estimation,
under
california
law,
the
controversy
arose
as
to...
the
controversy
in
issue
here
is
what
is
the
penalty
which
must
continue.
the
state
of
california
finds
no
problem
with
justice
kozinski's
determination,
and
the
district
court's
determination,
that
anyone
could
look
at
a
calendar
and
tell
that
she
was
paid
3
days
later
than
she
probably
should
have
been
paid.
what
our
problem
is
is
how
do
we
determine
what
the
penalty
is
that's
going
to
continue.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--the
penalty
is
found
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
here
was
how
we
would...
if
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
agreement,
how
we
would
determine
what
the
wage
was
that
was
to
continue
as
a
penalty.
the
answer
mr.
mccracken
gave
was
that
the
labor
commissioner
would
look
at
the
payroll
records.
we
wouldn't
look
at
the
payroll
records;
we'd
look
at
the
contract
of
employment
between
the
employer
and
employee.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
no,
the
penalty--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--but,
your
honor,
we
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
controversy
or
not
here.
we
don't...
safeway
was
enjoined
in
this
action.
we
don't
know
whether
safeway
agrees
that
that
was
the
correct
pay
or
not.
as
the
chief
justice
asked--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
feel
that
in
order
to...
under
the
state
law,
in
order
for
us
to
take
and
decide
this
particular
issue,
we
would
have
had
to
applied
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
wage
rate:
which
wage
rate
was
to
be
applied?
there
were
eight
different
wage
rates
that
were
set
out
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there's
a
vacation
pay
provision.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
we
would
go
to
the
contract
of
employment
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
well,
just
as
another
other
trier
of
fact
would
do,
your
honor.
we
would
ask
the
parties.
it
would...
it
might
become
a
question
of
veracity
by
one
or
the
other
as
to
what
the
true
rate
of
pay
was,
but
it
would
be...
it
would
be
possible
to
determine
it.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
in
20
years
of
experience
with
division
of
labor
standards
enforcement,
i
do
not
find
that
that's
the...
that's
my
experience.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
amount.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
in
most
cases,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
in
this
case
as
far
as
we
know
there
was
none.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
livadas
does
not...
ms.
livadas
does
not
dispute
the
amount
of
the
check,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
don't
know
what
safeway
would
have
done--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
they
had...
even
ms.
livadas
had
a
problem
in
determining
what
exactly
her
final
pay
was.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
we're
asking...
we're
asking
the
court
to
go
behind
the
court
of
appeals
decision
to
look
at
the
problem
that
faces
this...
the
state
of
california
and
other
states
where
we--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--not
on
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
i
understand,
your
honor.
[laughter]
that's
true.
there
is
no...
there
is
no
dispute
on
the
record
as
to
what
her
wages
were.
she
claimed
her
wages
were
$13
and
some
cents
an
hour.
we
have...
we
don't
have
safeway's
determination
as
to
what
those
wages
were.
but
i
might
point
out,
your
honor,
that
i
think
you...
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
the
question
what
would
happen
if
the
wage
rate
that
was
paid
was
only
half
of
the
amount
that
was
due,
how
would
we
determine
what
the
amount
was?
we'd
have
to
go
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
determine
what
the
amount
was.
this
case
cannot
be
decided
in
vacuum;
it
has
to
be
decided
looking
at
all
of
the
situations.
this
is
a
california--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
we
looked
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
that
we
would
have
to.
it
would
be
absolutely
necessary
for
us...
our
deputy
labor
commissioner
looked
it
from
that
point
of
view,
and
i
look
at
it
from
that
point
of
view.
we
would--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--they're...
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
true.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
that
would...
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
203,
that
it
would
be
willful,
a
willful
failure
to
pay.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
you
narrow
it
too
far,
if
you
will.
i
believe
what
this
is
is
where
she's
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
there
is
an
arbitration
clause
and
we
feel,
that
is
the
division
or
the
court
in
california
feels
that
we
would
have
to
apply
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
order
to
reach
the
amount
of
the
penalty,
those
are
the
three
ingredients
which
must
go
into
it.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
number...
i
would
disagree
with
your
categorization
that
the
right
to
the
203
penalties
is
guaranteed.
it's
not.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
we
would...
one
would
have
to
look
to
apply...
under
california
law,
and
this
is
a
california
statute,
the
labor
commissioner
was
following
california
procedural
rules
and
that's
the
procedural
rules
which
were
given
to
us.
and
that
if
the
rights
and
the
duties--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--i'm
not
so
sure
that
in
california,
that
the
substantive
right
would
be
clear
across
the
aboard.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
i
understand,
your
honor.
you
have
categorized...
as
i
understand
it,
justice
ginsburg,
you
have
categorized
the
right
to
the
penalty
under
section
203
as
a
substantive
right.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
there...
all
right,
the
right
to
be
paid
in
a
timely
manner,
that
right...
that
right
exists,
but
that
right
may
be
enforced,
by
the
division
of
labor
standards
enforcement,
by
other
means
than
by
the
penalty
under
section
203.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
that's
not
quite
so,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
to
section
201
of
the
labor
code,
and
i
think
they're
set
out
in
our
brief,
in--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--none
of
them.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
none
of
them
turn
on
collective
bargaining.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
i
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that's...
that's
exactly
what
the
second
sentence
of
section
229
of
the
labor
code,
the
section
that's
really
at
issue
here.
it's
the
second
section
of
229
that
provides
that
except
as...
that
the
provisions
which
would
allow
an
individual,
even
if
they
did
have
an
arbitration
clause
in
their
employment
contract,
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
sections
200
through
243,
is
not
allowed
if
the...
if
the
employment
is
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
contains
an
arbitration
clause,
and
it
is
necessary
to
either
interpret
or
apply
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
what
this...
what
that
would
mean
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
would
be
called
upon
to
interpret
california
law.
it's
our
position
that
in
the
event
that
ms.
livadas--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
california
law
provides
that
if...
in
the
event
that
it's
a
willful
failure
to
pay,
that
a
penalty
arises.
however,
section
229
of
the
california
labor
code,
we
feel,
the
second
sentence
of
section
229
precludes
the
labor
commissioner,
procedurally
precludes
the
labor
commissioner...
we
feel
precludes
the
state
courts
from
going
forward
and
determining
what
the
penalty
is,
because
that
penalty
has
to...
it's
necessary
to
either
interpret
or
apply
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
as
a
practical
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
because
i
believe
that...
i
believe
this
court
is
looking
at
the
term
"dispute"
as
emanating...
as
being
the
word
of
the
claimant.
if
the
claimant
comes
to
us,
in
good
faith
perhaps,
and
says,
here,
i'm
entitled
to
2
weeks
of
pay,
and
here's
what
i
make
per
hour,
we
would
have
to
take
that
case,
we
would
have
to
go
through
our
whole
procedure,
our
whole
administrative
procedure,
and
perhaps
at
the
end,
or
during
the
hearing
our
trier
of
fact,
our
hearing
officer,
may
very
well
find
that
safeway
stores
or
the
employer
disputes
that
particular--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--your
honor,
our--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--procedure--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--right.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
well,
we
would--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--yes.
the
answer
would
be
yes,
if
we...
if
safeway
said
that
she
was
making
$8
an
hour,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
dispute,
would
there,
under
those
circumstances.
but,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
system
that
we
implement.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
our
procedures
involve
a
letter
to
the
employer
outlining
the
fact
that
a
claim
has
been
filed.
if
there
is
no
answer
to
that
letter,
which
i
could
not
guarantee
that
there
would
be
an
answer
to
that
letter,
then
a
full-blown
hearing
is
held,
an
administrative
hearing.
these
administrative
hearings,
your
honor,
are
not...
they
should...
so
there's
not
any
misunderstanding,
our
hearing
officers
hold
approximately
four
per
day,
so
it's
not
as
if
there's
a
long
trial.
it's
generally
rather
short,
but
it
is
an
administrative
hearing.
we
handle
somewhere
around
17,000
of
them
per
year,
with
a
rather
limited
staff.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
we
send
out
the
notice
of
the
hearing.
if
they
fail
to
appear,
the
decision
is
based
on
the
evidence
obtained
from
the
claimant.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
we
could
subpoena
them
in,
your
honor,
but
we
find
that
that
would
be
less
than
effective,
because
we'd
have
to
go
out
and
serve
subpoenas.
we
can
notify--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--no,
no.
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
require
that
they
answer.
however,
they
take
a
terrible
chance
by
not
answering,
because
at
the
administrative
hearing
the
employer...
the
word
of
the
employee
is
taken
as
the
best
evidence.
it's
all...
it's
the
only
evidence
we
have.
but
either...
then
it
could
be...
that
matter
can
be
appealed
de
novo
by
either
side,
either
by
the
employee
or
the
employer,
to
the
appropriate
court,
depending
on
the
amount...
jurisdictional
amount
of
the
claim.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
if
that
were
so,
your
honor,
yes.
but
in
most
cases
where
it
is
waiting
time
penalty
only...
now
this
is
only...
this
is
a
case
which
involves
only
3
days
of
waiting
time
penalties.
very
truthfully,
most
of
our
cases
involve
30
days
of
waiting
time
penalties.
that's
the
cap.
because
there's
been
a
dispute
as
to
the
amount
owed,
and
the
employer
does
not
pay
until
well
after
the
30
days
has
expired.
but
the
30-day
limit
is
put
in
section
3...
203.
but
in
this
particular
case,
whether
or
not
safeway
would
have,
in
this
particular
case,
even
bothered
to
show
up,
i
really
don't
know,
your
honor.
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
safeway
or
any
employer...
if
the
labor
commissioner
took
a
case
which
was
on
the
cusp,
so
to
speak.
in
other
words,
it
could
be...
under
the...
by
applying
the
preemption
principles
which
ms.
livadas
requested
the
labor
commissioner
adopt,
instead
of
using
the
california
procedural
rules.
but
by
adopting
the
preemption
principles
such
as
that
was
found
in
the
footnote,
in
footnote
12
in
lingle,
if
the
labor
commissioner
were
to
make
a
decision
which
said
that
yes,
in
fact
we
do
have
jurisdiction,
there'd
be
no
reason
in
the
world
why
safeway
foods
or
some
other
employer
could
not
come
in,
remove
the
case
to
federal
court,
and
go
on
from
there.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
were
to
find
that
no,
in
fact,
we
do
not
have
jurisdiction,
there'd
be
no
reason
why
a
union
employee,
through
their
own
attorneys,
could
not
come
in
and
take
the
same
action
that
was
taken
here.
we're...
i
believe
the
term
"hobson's
choice"
was
used
in
the
briefing,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
labor
commissioner
and
the
state
of
california
and,
i
think,
the
labor
commissioner
or
the
states
in
general,
are
faced
with
a
"hobson's
choice".
we're
faced
with
the
position
of
not
knowing
which
way
to
go.
and
absent
a
bright
line--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
ms.
livadas
has
no
case
through
the
labor
commissioner.
we
are
precluded
by
section
229,
the
second
sentence.
and,
frankly,
i
believe
that
the
courts
in
california
are
precluded
from
granting
that
remedy
because
of
the
way
the
california
law
is
written.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
i
believe
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
but
that's
under
california
law,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
if
there
was
an
error
in
interpreting
the
california
supreme
court
and
it's
application...
and
whether
or
not
the
application
would
apply
in
this
particular
case,
it's
a
question
of
california
law.
and
as
judge
rymer--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--but
we
look
at
footnote
12
in
lingle,
your
honor,
as
drawing
the
outside
boundaries
of
where
the
state
may
go
as
far
as
preemption
is
concerned.
we
don't
look,
or
we
didn't
look
at
any
rate,
at
the
preemption
principle
set
down
by
this
court
as
delimiting
the
state
labor
commissioner's
right
to
set
its
own
jurisdictional--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--no,
it's
not.
it's
not
inconsistent
with,
we
don't
believe,
but
it's
not
coextensive
with.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
they
can,
your
honor.
i
believe,
though,
that
they
could,
in
fact,
provide
for
that
particular
problem
coming
up,
that
the
remedy
would
be
to
take
it
to
the
labor
commissioner.
i
believe
that's
possible.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
yes,
they
could
do
that
as
well.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
your
honor,
in
the
citation
on
howard...
i
don't
have
my...
you'll
see
where
howard
is
citing
from
posner
v.
grunwald.
and
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
they
also
have
the--
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
--it's
at
page
22,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
our
position
is
that
the
controversy
is
the
amount
of
the
penalty
that's
required
to
be
paid.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
no.
but
the
controversy...
the
right
to
it
arises
under
the...
the
right
to
receive
that
wage
rate
and
the
duty
to
pay
that
wage
rate
arises
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
h.
thomas
cadell,
jr.
justice
scalia,
as
an
aside
i've
had
20
years
with
the
labor
commissioner.
on
two
occasions...
one
occasion
myself
and
another
occasion
one
of
the
attorneys
that
work
for
me
had...
went
into
court
on
this
very
issue,
on...
concerning
an
arbitration
agreement
with
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
everything
else
and
attempting
to
collect
the
203
penalties.
in
both
instances
we
were
asked
the
same
question;
isn't
this
an
application
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
it's
not
simply
the
labor
commissioner--
