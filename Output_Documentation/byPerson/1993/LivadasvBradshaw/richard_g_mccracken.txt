mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
challenge
to
the
policy
of
the
california
labor
commissioner
not
to
enforce
the
california
labor
code
on
behalf
of
employees
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
providing
for
arbitration.
this
case
arose
on
january
2nd,
1990,
when
the
petitioner,
karen
livadas,
was
terminated
by
her
employer,
safeway
stores.
california
law
requires
that
upon
termination
of
an
employee,
the
employer
must
pay
all
of
the
accrued
wages
due
to
the
employee.
ms.
livadas
demanded,
upon
notice
of
her
termination,
that
she
be
paid
everything
she
was
owed,
but
her
store
manager
told
her
that
she
may
not
have
it;
that
safeway
would
instead
mail
it
to
her.
safeway
did
mail
her
a
check,
which
she
received
on
january
5th,
in
an
amount
which
she
never
disputed
was
the
amount
due
to
her.
however,
she
was
not
paid
when
she
was
due.
california
labor
code
section
203
provides
penalties
payable
by
an
employer
who
so
delays
termination
pay
to
an
employee.
ms.
livadas
went
to
the
local
office
of
the
california
labor
commissioner
to
file
a
claim
for
that
penalty
pay.
she
was
entitled,
under
california
law,
to
3
days
extra
pay
for
the
delay
in
her
termination
pay.
she
went
to
the
commissioner's
office,
tried
to
file
a
claim.
eventually,
she
did
file
a
claim
on
january
9th.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
penalties
provided
by
california
law
is
to
compel
the
employer
to
pay
on
time.
in
addition
to
that
policy,
the
california
labor
code
has
also
provided
for
many
years
that
the
commissioner
of
labor
has
the
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
penalties
are
collected,
that
the
law
is
enforced.
however,
in
this
case
the
commissioner,
acting
pursuant
to
his
policy,
decided
not
to
pursue
this
claim,
decided
not
to
investigate
it
or
to
submit
it
either
to
prosection
in
court
or
to
a
hearing
in
the
administrative
procedures
of
the
labor
commissioner.
the
reason
for
that
decision
was
solely
because
she
is
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
containing
an
arbitration
clause.
there
was
never
a
question
that
the
amount
that
she
was
owed
and
was
paid
by
safeway
was
correct.
there
was
never
a
dispute
in
this
case
that
in
any
way
involved
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
no,
it
was
never
defended
on
that
basis,
only
on
the
basis
that
the
labor
commissioner
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
take
this
position
in
order
to
avoid
problems
of
labor
law
preemption.
and--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--i
don't
believe
so,
because
the...
in
this
case
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
decision
can
be
based
upon
the
exercise
of
federal
rights,
in
this
case
the
right
to
select
a
collective
bargaining
representative
and
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
don't
believe
that
the
state,
however
benign
its
intentions,
may
classify
its
services
based
upon
that
exercise,
and
that's
what
has
happened
here.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
no,
we
don't,
because
it
never
was
raised
as
a
defense.
but
even
if
it
were,
we
don't
believe
that
there
would...
that
would
be
a
sufficient
defense
to
such
a
classification.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes.
justice
ginsburg,
that
situation,
we
believe,
would
be
answered
by
the
approach
described
by
the
court
in
lingle.
there
are
two
separate
systems
of
law
here,
and
they
can
work
together.
the
court
described
in
lingle
what
would
happen
in
that
situation,
namely
that
the
state
claim
would
be
still
valid.
there
would
be
resort
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
arbitration
process
to
find
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
or
not
the
employer
had
paid
the
employee
everything
that
was
due
upon
termination.
this
case
involves
what
i
consider
to
be
the
more
common
class
of
cases,
which
is
where
there
is
total
nonpayment
of
the
termination
pay
on
the
date
of
termination,
as
opposed
to
a
partial
payment,
but
there's
a
dispute
about
whether
it
was
the
correct
amount.
now,
under
california
law,
it
is
only
necessary,
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
willful
failure
to
pay
the
termination
pay,
that
the
employer
have
intentionally
not
paid
it.
and
so
upon
return
from
the
collective
bargaining
process
of
the
answer
whether
or
not
the
amount
was
correct,
the
labor
commissioner
would
then
have
decided
a
question
of
state
law,
which
is
whether
the
intentional
failure
to
pay
everything
that
was
due
was
a
willful
violation
and
therefore
cause
for
penalties.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
that's
correct.
yes,
we
believe
that
every
time--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--in
the
case
of
termination
pay
we
believe
that
is
absolutely
correct,
that
what
would
happen
here
is
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
payment
had
been
made
on
time
would
always
be
open
for
state
law
to
resolve.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
full
payment
had
been
made
is
a
question
to
be
resolved
in
the
grievance
and
arbitration
process
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
as
the
court
described
in
lingle.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes,
justice
scalia,
that
is
true--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--in
that
hypothetical
case,
that
would
be
true.
this,
of
course--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--we
believe
that
what
would
happen
is--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--it
would
not
be
preempted.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
the
labor
commissioner
would
not
be
interpreting
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
labor
commissioner
would
not
go
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
resolve
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
employee
had
been
paid
everything
due.
instead,
the
labor
commissioner
would
depend
upon
getting
that
knowledge
from
the
grievance
and
arbitration
process
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so,
for
instance,
if
the
employee
said
i
wasn't
paid
everything
i
was
due
and
filed
a
grievance
about
it,
and
the
resolution
of
the
grievance
was
either
the
employer
agreed
or
an
arbitrator
ruled
that,
indeed,
the
employer
had
not
paid
everything
that
was
due,
that
information
would
then
go
back
to
the
labor
commissioner,
who
would
then
know,
without
having
to
interpret
the
agreement
himself,
that,
in
fact,
the
employee
had
not
been
paid
everything
that
was
due
upon
termination.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
either
an
arbitration
agreement
or
some
other
dispute
resolution
mechanism.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
the...
in
cases
such
as
this,
there
is
no
reason
for
anyone
to
resort
to
that
process
because
there
was
never
any
dispute
under
the
agreement
about
what
was
due.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
well,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that's
taking
it
to
far.
i
think--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--because
i
think
what
the
court
was
saying
in
lingle,
especially
its
description
in
footnote
12
of
how
to
resolve
these
problems
of
interplay
between
the
two
systems,
is
that
there
are
many
occasions
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
get
data
from
the
collective
bargaining
process.
for
instance,
in
lingle
itself,
the...
part
of
the
damages
sought
by
the
employee
was
back
pay.
back
pay
would
have
to
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
because
it
set
the
rate
of
pay
and
such
things
as
vacation
and
holiday
pay
and
that
type
of
thing.
one
can't
say
that
the
state's
tort
should
be
preempted
because
the
measurements
of
damages
for
the
tort
requires
some
resort
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
as
i
understand,
what
the
court
was
saying
in
that
case
is
that,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
process
still
operates,
but
it
operates
independently
of
state
law.
but
what
it
does
is
to
provide
information
necessary
for
the
resolution
of
such
questions
as
damages,
and
that's
all
we're
really
saying
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
i
believe,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
what
happens
is
that
the
commissioner
looks
at
the
employer's
payroll
records
to
determine
the
answer
to
that
question,
the
same
as
the--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--if
what
has
happened
is
that
the...
that
question,
whether
there's
2
hours'
pay
missing,
the
commissioner
would
investigate
to
see
whether
the
2
hours
were
worked
and
whether
the
2
hours
were
paid,
and
then
would
find
that
there
was
underpayment,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
well,
the
test
under
california
law,
justice
kennedy,
is
whether
the
nonpayment
was
intentional.
willful
is
equated
to
intentional
under
triad
data
services.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
that's
a
matter
for
the
commissioner
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
my
view
of
it,
having
read
the
cases,
is
that
if
the
employer
did
have
a
good-faith
doubt,
that
would
be
sufficient
reason
to
deny
the
penalties.
but
if
the
situation
were
that
the
employer
knew
that
there
was
a
question
about
how
much
pay
was
due
but
made
the
intentional
decision
not
to
pay
the
disputed
amount
and
to
make
the
employee
go
to
whatever
measures
were
necessary
in
order
to
recover
it,
it
seems
to
me
it's
conceivable
that
under
the
triad
data
services
test
for
willfulness,
that
that
would
still
be
willful,
because
it
was
an
intentional
decision
made
by
the
employer.
but,
again,
that
is
a
question
of
state
law
and
not
of
federal
law,
how
willful
the
decision
was.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes,
i
can
see
how
it
might,
because
the
degree
of
the
employer's
good
faith
would
be,
in
turn,
somewhat
conditioned
by
the
merits
of
its
argument
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
a
certain
amount
was
not
due.
and
i
can
see
that
arising
in
that
type
of
case,
where
there
is
partial
nonpayment
as
opposed
to
total
nonpayment.
nevertheless,
this
is
a
case,
as
is
usually
true,
of
total
nonpayment.
and
certainly
in
that
class
of
cases,
it
is
not
necessary
to
evaluate
willfulness
or
anything
of
the
sort.
we
also
believe
that
the
way
to
handle
that
particular
problem,
justice
kennedy,
the
one
of
the
rare
case
in
which
there
may
actually
be
some
question
of
contract
interpretation
that
is
at
least
tangentially
involved,
is
nevertheless
for
the
labor
commissioner
to
go
forward
unless
it
is
clear
that
the
matter
is
preempted.
so
that
the
question
of
preemption,
that
is
whether
the
claim
is
substantially
dependent
on
analysis
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
can
be
resolved
by
the
california
courts
as...
if
the
employer
raises
it
as
a
defense.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes.
i
think
that,
in
my
experience,
that
is
a
very
uncommon
situation,
that
usually
the
amount
owed
on
termination
is
quite
clear,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
main
class
of
cases
involving
termination
pay.
and,
of
course,
the
commissioner's
policy
systematically
excludes
all
those
claims
from
the
enforcement
services
that
the
commissioner
offers
the
rest
of
californians,
and
that
is
the
problem
in
this
case.
it
is
a...
in
our
opinion,
a
straightforward
application
of
golden
state,
because
the--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--no,
i'm
afraid
i
can't
agree,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
however
the
california
law
is
justified,
if
it
draws
a
distinction
in
the
receipt
of
state
services
between
those
who
exercise
and
those
who
do
not
exercise
their
federal
rights,
then
that
is
a
1983
case.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes,
a
violation
of
section
7
redressable
through
section
1983.
section
7,
of
course,
is
a
somewhat
unique
section
in
federal
law
in
that
it
gives
an
unqualified
right
to
employees
to
exercise
the
rights
described
in
there...
therein,
to
select
a
collective
bargaining
representative
and
to
negotiate
collective.
it's
a
right
that
is
good
against
all
comers.
it
is
good
against
the
state,
against
employers,
against
unions,
and
even
against
the
federal
government.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
we
say,
mr.
justice...
chief
justice,
that
there
is
no
way
the
state
can
take
that
exercise
into
account
either
way,
so
that
if
employees
had
voted
not
to
be
represented
by
a
union,
that
the
state
could
not--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--no,
we
don't
see
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
under
golden
state,
the
question
is
whether
the
state
benefit
has
been
conditioned
upon
the
nonexercise
of
federal
rights,
and
that
is
the
case
here.
the
only
people
who
receive
this
benefit
from
the
state
are
those
who
have
chosen
not
to
exercise
their
rights
under
section
7
to
select
the
collective
bargaining
representative.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
she
could
proceed,
herself,
in
court,
to
enforce
the
claim.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes,
if
she
won.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
on
the
other
hand,
if
she
lost,
the
employer's
attorney's
fees
could
be
assessed
against
her.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
so
there's...
in
addition
to
the
lack
of
familiarity
most
workers
have
with
the
law
and
legal
processes
and
the
intimidation
that
many
of
them
feel
when
approaching
that
institutions,
there
is
also
a
good
deal
of
risk,
downside
risk
to
an
employee
who
peruses
a
claim
on
her
own.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes,
to
begin
with,
and
a
lawyer
who's
prepared
to
advise
her
that
she
might
end
up
owing
more
than
she
sought.
so
it's
not
a
practical
alternative
and,
in
fact,
it
is
very
rarely
perused,
as
a
result.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
justice
scalia--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
in
that
particular
example
of
arbitration
services,
the
state
would
not
be
able
to...
would
be
entitled
to
do
that
because,
in
that
case,
the...
you
would
be
running
directly
into
section
301
preemption,
given
the...
how
important
arbitration
is
to
section
301
and
how
federal
law
completely
governs
the
question
of
what
is
arbitrable
and
how
it
shall
be
arbitrated.
this
is
a
different
case.
it's
like
the
fort
halifax
case,
in
that
we're
dealing
with
minimal
labor
standards
that
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
collective
bargaining
process
itself.
and
as
far
as
whether
or
not
there
is
some
type
of
classification
based
upon
section
7
rights
that
could
be
justified
on
a
rational
basis
test,
it's
conceivable
that
there
is,
although
the
examples
seem,
to
me,
to
be
very
limited.
one
such
example,
conceivably,
is
a
statute
such
as
the
one
in
fort
halifax,
where
there
was
a
specific
provision
made
to
allow
the
collective
bargaining
process
to
work
so
that
the
state
law
applied
until
a
different
result
was
obtained
in
collective
bargaining.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
would
pass
a
rational
basis
test,
and
a
type
of
classification
that
could
be...
to
which
that
test
could
be
applied.
the
difficulty
here,
of
course,
is
that
the
state
has
not
given
the
process
an
opportunity
to
work,
but
rather
has
denied
it
materials
with
which
to
work,
as
informed--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--thank
you.
