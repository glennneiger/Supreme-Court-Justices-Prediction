justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mccracken,
you
twice
emphasized
that
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
amount
due
in
this
particular
case,
but
the
respondent
does
emphasize...
and
i'm
looking
at
page
42
of
the
brief...
that
this
is
an
example
of
a
class
of
cases,
and
that
in
some
such
cases,
at
least,
there
would
be
a
dispute
about
the
amount.
for
example,
it
mentions
the
possibility
of
a
penalty
sum
and
of
vacation
wages
that
might
involve
complex
calculations
based
on
the
specific
provisions
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
suppose
there
were
a
dispute
as
to
the
amount
and
that
dispute
turned
on
what
the
wage
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
meant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
we
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
original
question,
and
suppose
the
california
law
is
clear
that
these
sections,
201
and
203,
don't
apply
to
people
whose
unit
is
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
only
for
the
particularly
needy
workers
who
don't
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
governing
their
employment
relationship.
there
would
be
no
federal
question,
would
there,
if
that
were,
indeed,
the
california
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you'd
say
it
was
a
violation
of
section
7.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say,
then,
there
was
a
basis
for
a
reasonable
belief
for
the
cases
in
which
the
amount
due
requires
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
would
it
be
the
kind
of
case
about
which
justice
scalia
inquired
that
you
are
unprepared
to
answer?
would
that
be
the
kind
of
case
where
there
might
be
good
faith,
although
wrong
reliance
on
a
preemption
notion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
telling
me
that
deferral
of
the
labor
department
coming
in,
this...
the
position
here
is
if
it
requires
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
then
the
department
of
labor,
california
department,
never
comes
into
the
picture
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she's
not
disputing
that.
you're
asking
us
to
go
behind
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
she
didn't
dispute
the
amount
of
the
check
and
say
perhaps
she
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cadell,
the
position...
your
position
about
what
california
law
is
is
less
than
clear
to
me,
and
it
seems
to
have
somewhat
shifted,
so
let's
go
back
to
the
first
base.
is
it
clear
that
201
and
203,
the
basic
right
to
be
paid
and
to
be
paid
on
time,
the
basic
right
stated
in
those
sections
applies
to
all
workers,
whether
they're
subject
to
collective
bargaining
contract
or
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
those
are
mandatory
provisions
that
must
be
paid
to
every
worker,
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we're
only
talking
about
who
enforces,
then,
whether
the
wage
earner...
if
she's
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
she
will
have
to
come
to
court
on
her
own,
but
if
she's
not
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
then
she
gets
the
commissioner
to
take
care
of
her
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
her
case
where
there's
nothing
to
interpret
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
you
won't
bring
her
claim,
but
you
say
that
her
right
to
this
pay
is
guaranteed
by
state
law.
how
does
she
enforce
the
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there's...
if
there
was
willful.
we'll
assume
the
terms
of
the
state
law
are
met.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
the
difference
between
the
rights
of
someone
who
is
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
rights
of
one
who
is
not.
you
seem
to
say
the
difference
is
purely
procedural,
that
they
both
have
the
same
substantive
right
to
be
paid
on
time
and
to
get
penalties
if
there's
been
a
willful
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
trying
to
find...
before
we
get
to
the
procedure,
is
the
substantive
right
of
all
workers
the
same?
that
is,
to
be
paid
on
time
and
in
the
event
of
a
willful
failure
to
pay
on
time,
to
get
a
penalty
payment.
is
the
substantive
right
the
same
for
all
of
the
people,
so
that
we're...
the
only
difference
we're
talking
about
between
collective
bargaining
and
noncollective
bargaining
is
how
you
enforce
that
substantive
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
please
tell
us
what
the
substantive
right
of
the
employees...
what
their
substantive
rights
are,
because
we'll
get
terribly
confused
if
we
don't
even
know
what
california's
position
is
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
start
with
201.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
substantive
right
is
enjoyed
by
persons,
whether
they're
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
not.
all
employees
get
that
substantive
right,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
they...
do
any
of
them
turn
on
collective
bargaining
versus--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
the
substantive
right
in
203
to
a
penalty
in
the
event
of
a
willful
failure
to
pay
is
any
distinction
as
far
as
the
substantive
right,
made
on
the
basis
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
say
that
it
isn't
necessary
because
there's
no
dispute
about...
the
check
for
the
wages
due
on
firing
are
paid,
and
the
employee
says
that's
the
right
amount,
now
i
just
want
3
extra
days'
worth.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
asking
you
what...
you
to
tell
me
what
the
california
law
is,
not
for
the
court
to
interpret
it.
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
the
california
law
is,
so
then
i
can
determine
intelligently
this
federal
preemption
or
not
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
trying
to
learn
from
you
what
california
law
is,
and
i've
not
yet
grasped
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's...
that's...
i
have
had
a
problem
understanding
what
california
law
is
apart
from
preemption.
maybe
i
can
get
at
my
difficulty
this
way.
suppose
there
were
no
federal
preemption
doctrine
at
all,
not
in
the
picture
at
all.
we
have
201,
203,
and
229.
what
happens
to
ms.
livadas'
claim
with
california
law
as
the
only
law
in
the
picture?
she's
in
a
unit
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
she
hasn't
been
paid
the
day
she
was
fired,
she's
paid
3
or
4
days
later,
what
are
her
rights
under
the
california
code
and
how
does
she
enforce
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
that
federal--
--but
does
that
mean...
go
ahead.
--federal
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
the
result,
what
happened
to
ms.
livadas
happened
strictly
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
she
has
no
right
to
have
the
labor
commissioner
represent
her,
period.
