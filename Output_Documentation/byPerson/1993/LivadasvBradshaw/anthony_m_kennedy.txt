m.
kennedy
could
he
properly
have
defended
it
upon
the
grounds
that...
hypothesized
by
the
chief
justice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
penalty
can't
be
imposed
unless
it
were
willful.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
employer
had
a
good
faith
doubt,
there
would
be
no
penalty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
he
had
a
good
faith
doubt,
there
would
be
no
penalty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
it
might
bear
on
how
these
two
acts
or
how
these
two
conflicting
sovereignties
bear
upon
each
other
in
a
case
where,
as
justice
scalia
put
it,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
clear.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
true
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
there's
very
little
occasion
to
have
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
amount
owed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
229
preemption
is
not
coextensive,
in
your
view,
with
301
preemption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this.
can
the
parties
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
waive
the
provisions
of
the
california
law
on
prompt
payment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
they
provide
that
the
remedy
is
not
to
take
it
to
the
labor
commissioner,
but
to
arbitrate
it?
