justice
david
h.
souter
so
what
it
boils
down
to
is
you're
saying
every
time
you
look
to
federal
law
for
an
answer
to
a
question
that
arises
in
a
state
law
action,
you
don't
have
preemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
have
process
to
require
them
to
show
up
for
the
hearing.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
do
you
have
process?
do
you
have
the
authority
under
california
law
to
order
them
to
appear?
justice
david
h.
souter
wait,
but
you
have...
you
have
no
process
to
require
them
to
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
understand
why
that
is
true
under
california
law,
because
under
california
law
the
labor
commissioner's
disability
turns
on
the
existence
of
a
dispute,
and
you
don't
even
find
out
whether
there
is
a
dispute.
all
you've
got
to
do
is
require
a
response
to
determine
whether,
in
fact,
there
is
a
dispute
about
interpretation
or
application.
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
as
apparently
it
was
or
would
have
been
no
in
this
case,
then
under
your
own
law
you
will
go
ahead,
represent
her,
this
problem
will
not
arise.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
have
been
telling
us
that
under
california
law
you
are
precluded
from
doing
what
this
particular
claimant
wants.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
don't
see
why
this
record
even
establishes
the
predicate,
under
california
law,
for
the
position
that
you're
taking?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
a
question
of
california
law,
but
it
puts
you
in
the
position,
it
seems
to
me,
of
taking
across
the
board...
in
every
case,
without
determining
the
existence
of
a
dispute
or
not,
it
puts
california
in
the
position
of
running
afoul,
i
would
suppose,
of
the...
of
footnote
12
in
lingle,
which
attempts
to
draw
the
line
between
what
it
is
appropriate
for
a
state
to
do
and
what
it
is
not
appropriate
for
a
state
to
do
in
terms
of
federal
labor
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
when
the
petitioner
here,
karen
livadas,
was
discharged
from
her
job
as
a
grocery
clerk,
she
asked
the
store
manager
for
the
immediate
payment
of
all
wages
owed
to
her
a
right
which
was
guaranteed
to
employees
by
california
law.
the
manager
refused
explaining
that
it
was
company
policy
to
make
payments
by
check
mailed
from
a
central
office
and
a
check,
in
the
amount
of,
did
arrived
three
days
later.
livadas
sent
file
a
claim
with
the
california
division
of
labor
standards
enforcement
asserting
her
right
under
a
second
state
law
provision
the
three
days
penalty
wages
from
her
employer
reflecting
the
delay
in
payment.
the
division
sent
back
a
form
letter
stating
that
no
action
would
be
taken
on
the
penalty
claim
because
the
policy
of
the
state
labor
commissioner,
who
is
the
respondent
here,
was
to
decline
to
enforce
claims
on
behalf
of
workers
like
livadas
whose
terms
of
employment
are
governed
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
containing
arbitration
clauses.
enforcing
their
claims,
the
commissioner
explained
entail
the
interpretation
or
application
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
by
a
state
tribunal
and
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
state
and
federal
policy
favoring
arbitrary
resolution
of
collective
bargaining
disputes.
livadas
brought
suit
in
federal
court
claiming
that
the
commissioner's
policy
was
preempted
by
a
federal
law
because
it
denied
employees
benefits
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
exercise
of
national
labor
relations
act
rights
to
bargain
collectively.
the
district
court
ruled
in
livadas'
favor
and
ordered
the
commissioner
to
abandon
the
policy,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
held
before
that
state
rules
denying
benefits
to
employees
based
on
the
exercise
of
federal
labor
law
rights
pose
special
dangers
of
frustrating
congressional
purpose
and
this
case
is
fundamentally
no
different.
the
policy
challenged
to
present
its
employees
with
an
appetizing
choice.
they
may
bargain
collectively
and
each
agreements
containing
arbitration
clauses
or
they
may
have
their
state
law
rights
enforced
by
the
commissioner,
but
not
both.
the
respondent
offered
several
explanations
to
the
policy,
none
of
which
alters
our
preemption
conclusion.
first,
the
commissioner
suggested
that
the
policy
is
actually
required
by
distinct
provision
of
federal
labor
law,
section
301
of
the
management
relations
act,
which
displaces
state
law
causes
of
action
alleging
breaches
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
duties,
but
we
have
consistently
declined
to
give
that
provision
the
broad
sweep
the
commissioner
seeks
for
it
here.
the
commissioner
advances
a
number
of
additional
reasons
why
the
policy
is
sensible
and
why
the
distinction
it
draws
between
union
represented
employees
and
others
is
reasonable.
we
note,
however,
that
several
of
these
rationales
do
not
fit
neatly
with
state
law
as
written,
or
with
the
commissioner's
policy
as
previously
stated.
in
any
event,
preemption
analysis
depends
on
the
impairment
of
federal
objectives
and
not
on
the
legitimacy
of
the
state's
interest
or
the
soundness
of
its
classifications.
finally,
we
hold
that
livadas
is
entitled
to
seek
relief
under
42
u.s.
code
1983
because
her
claim
that
the
respondent
has
abridged
a
right
guaranteed
to
her
by
a
law
of
the
united
states
is
covered
by
the
text
in
the
aims
of
that
remedial
statute.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
