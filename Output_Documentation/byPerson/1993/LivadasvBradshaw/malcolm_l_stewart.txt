mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
court,
respondent
appears
largely
to
have
abandoned
the
argument
that
he
was
prevented
from
processing
ms.
livadas'
claim
by
federal
preemption
principles.
his
argument,
instead,
is
that
his
policy
of
nonprocessing
is
necessary
to
vindicate
the
state's
independent
policy
of
respecting
arbitration
agreements
and
holding
parties
to
the
terms
of
their
contract.
and
we
think
this
reflects
a
fundamental
misconception
of
the
role
of
the
labor
arbitrator
in
a
collective
bargaining
situation.
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear
that
a
labor
arbitrator
operating
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
power
only
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
agreement,
and
the
arbitrator
does
not
have
a
general
authority
to
enforce
the
terms
of
public
laws
that
the
parties
have
not
incorporated
into
their
contract.
consequently,
the
result
of
the
labor
commissioner's
policy
is
not
that
ms.
livadas
will
be
relegated
to
an
arbitratal
forum
in
order
to
pursue
her
claim
for
penalties.
if
ms.
livadas
somehow
prevailed
upon
her
union
to
take
to
arbitration
her
claim
for
section
203
penalties,
the
arbitrator
would
undoubtedly
deny
relief
because
the
late
payment
provisions
of
california
law
have
not
been
incorporated
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
consequently,
the
result
will
be
that
ms.
livadas
lacks
a
remedy
within
the
state
system
and
lacks
an
arbitral
remedy
as
well.
the
consequence
of
that
is
that
ms.
livadas,
and
workers
like
her,
will
be
deprived
of
state
law
protections
that
are
available
to
all
other
employees
within
the
state.
that
seems
to
be
precisely
the
result
that
this
court
discountenanced
in
metropolitan
life,
when
the
court
said
that
a
regime
which
would
exclude
unionized
workers
or
workers
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
from
the
reach
of
state
minimum
standards
laws,
would
be
incompatible
with
the
policies
animating
the
nlra.
second,
i
think
that
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
is
effected
here,
that
is
an
exclusion
from
state
law
benefits
for
workers
who
are
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
is
precisely
what
was
at
issue
in
this
court's
decision
in
nash
v.
florida
industrial
commission.
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
was
an
individual
who
had
been
denied
unemployment
compensation
under
florida
law
because
she
had
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
nlrb.
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
violation
of
her
rights
under
the
nlra,
and
stated
that
the
state
of
florida
should
not
be
permitted
to
defeat
or
handicap
a
valid
national
objective
by
threatening
to
withdraw
state
benefits
from
persons
simply
because
they
cooperate
with
the
government's
constitutional
plan.
here,
also,
ms.
livadas
is
being
denied
state
benefits
otherwise
available
on
the
ground
that
she
exercised
her
federal
right
to
participate
in
collective
bargaining.
i
think
nash
makes
clear
both
that
individuals
who
exercise
section
7
rights
may
not
be
penalized
by
the
states
for
doing
so,
and
makes
clear,
as
well,
that
the
penalty
may
take
the
form
of
a
withdrawal
of
benefits
that
would
otherwise
be
available
under
state
law.
and,
finally,
we
believe
that
section
1983
is
an
appropriate
vehicle
by
which
ms.
livadas
can
vindicate
her
federal
rights.
this
court
has
made
clear,
in
golden
state,
that
state
action
which
interferes
with
the
operation
of
the
nlra
may
form
the
basis
for
a
section
1983
action.
and,
indeed,
we
think
this
is
a
much
clearer
case
for
1983
relief
than
was
golden
state.
here
there's
no
need
to
infer
from
the
structure
of
the
act
a
federal
right.
section
7
of
the
nlra
states
explicitly
that
employees
shall
have
the
right
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
and
to
join
unions.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
state's
action
penalizes
ms.
livadas
for
exercising
that
right,
section
1983
provides
an
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
if
the
mistake
is
simply
that
he
reasonable
believed
that
what
he
was
doing
is
legal,
that
amounts
to
a
claim
of
good-faith
immunity
which
has
no
application
to
official
capacity
suits.
if
he's
making
the
claim
that
he
reasonably
and
in
good
faith
believed
that
what
he
was
doing
was
required
by
federal
law,
we
think
in
this
case
there's
no
need
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
that
could
furnish
a
defense.
because
this
court,
in
lingle,
cited
as
the
example
of
when
state
authorities
could
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
the
situation
in
which
it
was
necessary
to
look
to
the
cba
in
order
to
determine
wage
rates,
and
thus
to
calculate
a
penalty
under
state
law.
so
even
if
there
was
a
good
faith
defense
of
the
sort
that
you
postulate,
it
couldn't
be
applicable
here.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
clearly
this
court
may
reach
cases
in
the
future
in
which
a
state
official
has
operated
on
the
basis
of
a
preemption
theory
which
was
reasonable
at
the
time,
but
turned
out
to
be
wrong.
but
there's
certainly
no
basis
for
the
respondent's
argument
that
even
though
what
he
did
may
have
been
unreasonable,
nevertheless
he
ought
to
be
protected
because
a
case
may
arise
in
the
future
in
which
the
conduct
was
reasonable.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i...
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i'm
authorized,
on
behalf
of
the
government,
to
take
a
position
on
that.
we
are
not...
i
am
not
aware
of
cases
either
rejecting
or
accepting
the
theory
that
a
reasonable
belief
that
what
one
was
doing
was
required
by
federal
law
can
furnish
a
defense
to
what
would
otherwise
be
a
federal
violation.
it
is
quite
clear,
in
the
context
of
official
capacity
suite,
that
a
reasonable
belief
simply
in
the
legality
of
one's
actions
is
not
a
sufficient
defense.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
if
there
were
a
situation
in
which
the
employer
paid
upon
termination
and
the
dispute
was
whether
the
employer
had
paid
all
the
wages
due,
we
think
that'd
be
a
different
sort
of
case,
because
it
would
be
a
necessary
step
in
ms.
livadas'
claim
for
penalties.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
think,
in
that
context,
the
arbitrator...
the
labor
commissioner
would
be
entitled
at
least
to
defer
his
proceedings
until
the
arbitration
processes
had
run
their
course.
as
mr.
mccracken
pointed
out,
even
if
the
arbitrator
determined
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
employee
was
entitled
to
additional
wages,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
follow
that
the
employer
was
subject
to
penalties,
because
the
employer
might
have
had
a
reasonable
good
faith
belief
that
all
wages
owed
had
been
paid.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
what...
again,
what
we
think
is
unreasonable
about
the
california
labor
commissioner's
policy
is
that
it
applies
even
when
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
whether
the
cba
has
been
breached,
even
where
all
parties
agree
that
the
wages
due
under
the
contract
have
been
paid
and
the
only
question
is
whether
an
independent
state
law
duty
to
pay
them
at
the
time
of
termination--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--first
of
all--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--not
authorized,
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
am
here
only
in
my
capacity
as
an
assistant
to
the
solicitor
general,
and
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
have
been
told
that
i'm
not
authorized
to
represent
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
