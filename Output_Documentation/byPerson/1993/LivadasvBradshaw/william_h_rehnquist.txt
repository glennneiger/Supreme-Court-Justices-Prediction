chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
92-1920,
karen
livadas
v.
lloyd
aubry,
california
labor
commissioner.
mr.
mccracken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
labor
commissioner,
mr.
mccracken,
never
defended
the
policy
on
the
basis
that
people
who
aren't
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
really
need
more
help
from
the
state
than
people
who
are
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's,
at
any
rate,
something
you
don't
have
to
bite
off,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
there's
an
election
held
by
the
labor
board
and
a
group
of
employees
at
a
plant
vote
not
to
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
they've
exercised
their
rights
under
the
federal
law
just
the
way
that
people
have
who
have
elected
to
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
yet
you
say
that
the
state
could
not,
say,
treat
them
the
same
as
people
who
have
never
had
the
opportunity
to
bargain?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
like
an
extraordinarily
broad
doctrine.
what
you're
talking
about
is
an
equal
protection
challenge,
and
it's
really...
any
rational
basis
is
sufficient
to
justify
state
action
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccracken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stewart,
you're
here
as
an
advocate,
and
you're
perfectly
free
to
disclaim
any
responsibility
for
the
government
supporting
your
view,
but
i
think
you
are
obligated
to
answer
questions
about
hypotheticals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
here
because
leave
was
granted
you
to
argue
pro
had
vice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
cadell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
there
was
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
certain
says
in...
i
presume
it's
correct,
unless
there's
some
reason
to
dispute
it,
that
livadas
does
not
dispute
the
amount
of
the
check.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
safeway
sent
her
the
check,
so
presumably
they
don't
dispute
it.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--okay.
but
then
you're
asking
us
to
say
there
are
going
to
be
lots
of
other
fact
situations
coming
up
where
there
were...
would
be
disputes
about
the
amount,
but
in
this
case
there
simply
wasn't
any
dispute
as
to
the
amount
owed,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
not
on
the
record
and
that's
what
courts
go
by,
is
the
record.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
surely
there
must
be
something
short
of
a
full
administrative
hearing
that
would
enable
you
to
find
out
whether
the
person's
claim
as
to
what
rate
they
were
being
paid
per
hour
is
or
is
not
disputed
by
the
employer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
telling
me
there
is...
that
if
someone
comes
into
you
and
says
i
was
making
$8
bucks
an
hour
at
safeway.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
the
next
step
would
be
a
full-fledged
administrative
hearing,
even
though
perhaps
safeway,
if
it
were
contacted,
said...
would
say,
yes,
she
was
making
$8
an
hour?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you
answer
that
question
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
that's
one
of
the
problems
here.
[laughter]
i
mean,
your
procedures
don't
involve
getting
a
hold
of
safeway
and
finding
out
if
this
sum
is
disputed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
cadell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-1920,
livadas
against
bradshaw
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
