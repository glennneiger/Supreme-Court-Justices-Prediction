justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
you
would
not
have
preemption
even
in
the
case
where
it's
highly
questionable
what
the
meaning
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
as
to
entitlement
to
vacation
wages?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
two
questions
are
connected.
you
can't
say...
you
know,
she'll
say
it
hasn't
been
made
on
time
because
you
only
gave
me
part
of
what
i'm
entitled
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
separate
the
two
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
would
happen
in
that
hypothetical
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
preempted
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
there's
an
arbitration
agreement
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
some
other
mechanism.
however,
why
isn't
this
valid
in
all
cases
then?
why
have
we
gone
through
all
this
trouble
of
saying
that
there's
preemption?
why
couldn't
we
always
say
there's
never
preemption;
the
state
simply
has
to
wait
for
the
dispute
resolution
mechanism
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
play
itself
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
cases
like
this.
i'm
talking
about
cases
where
there
is
a
dispute.
why
is
this
class
of
case
any
different
from
the
totality
of
cases?
why
isn't
the
solution
that
you've
just
proposed
applicable
to
all
of
these
cases,
so
we
really
shouldn't
have
had
a
preemption
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
is,
but
you
tell
me
why
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccracken,
can
i...
i
don't
want
to
eat
up
too
much
of
your
time,
but
coming
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
whether
golden
state
has
any
equal
protection
flavor
to
it,
is
it
your
contention
that
even
the
most
rational
of
bases
for
treating
union
employees
and
nonemployees
differently
will
not
suffice
to
avoid
running
afoul
of
golden
state.
i
mean,
what
if
the
state
provides,
for
example,
arbitration
services,
but
it
says,
of
course,
we
don't
provide
them
for
people
that
have
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
reason
of
their
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
that's
easy
for
you
to
say.
[laughter]
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
our
law
on
preemption
is
hard
to
figure
out,
at
least
as
applied
to
the
concrete
facts
of
particular
cases.
and
what
the
commissioner
is
arguing
is,
you
know,
cut
me
a
little
slack;
at
least
where
there's
arguable
preemption,
i
ought
to
be
able
to
proceed
in
a
reasonable
fashion
without
being
subjected
to
a
1983
action.
is
it
your
contention
that
whenever
he
makes
a
mistake
as
to
whether
there's
preemption
or
not,
he's
subject
to
being
sued?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
case
is
easy,
but
the
commissioner
is
going
to
have
to
decide
what
he's
going
to
do
in
the
future,
if
he
loses
this
case.
or
is
he
going
to
be
able
to
proceed
in
the
fashion
he
did
here
at
least
where
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
amount
of
wages
due?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
just
tell
me
what
we
do
in
the
future
when
he
was
reasonable
but
wrong,
what
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
understand
that.
that's
this
case.
but
i
think
justice
ginsburg
is
asking
you
about
the
case...
she's
still
on
her
hypothetical
where
there,
in
fact,
was
a
dispute
as
to
the
amount.
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
commissioner
may
be
authorized
not
merely
to
defer,
but
to
stay
out
in
the
good
faith
belief
that
it
preempted?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
not
authorized.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
section
you've
quoted
to
us
reads...
the
provision...
the
sentence
from
posner
reads:
"any
controversy
under
a
collective
bargaining
contract
which
requires--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
there's
no
controversy
here.
they're
in
agreement
as
to
the
amount
due.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me,
is
that
penalty
provided
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
have
me
confused.
isn't
the
penalty
provided
by
california
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
not
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
you
have
to
know
what
the
wages...
is
what
the
wages
are,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
parties
agree
about
the
wages,
there
is
no
controversy
and
this
sentence
doesn't
even
come
into
play.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
will
always
presume
that
there
is
a
controversy
concerning
the
collective...
that
involves
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
you
feel
authorized
to
do
that,
to
simply
always
presume
that
there
is
some
controversy,
unless
you
know
otherwise,
involving
the
cba.
that
seems
to
me
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cadell,
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
we
adopted
a
rule,
which
might
be
a
reasonable
rule,
that
the
state
can
treat
these
matters
in
the
generality
so
that
it
need
not
be
the
case
that
every
single...
every
single
dispute
in
which
it
does
not
provide
assistance
is
one
in
which
there
would
have
been
preemption.
but
at
least
we
might
say
the
general
category
has
to
be
a
reasonable
category
that
the
state
has
collected
together.
in
this
category
of
cases,
it
is
very
likely
that
there
will
be
preemption
and
therefore
we
won't
provide
assistance.
even
if
we
adopted
that
rule,
this
case
doesn't
come
within
it.
i
mean,
the
state
has
just
said
whenever
there's
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
period,
we
will
assume
that
the
dispute
involves
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
that's
just...
that's
simply
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cadell,
let
me
ask
you
a
practical
question.
suppose
this
court
should
decide
that
the
commissioner
would
be
able,
lawfully,
to
decline
to
provide
representation
if
it
interpreted
that
second
sentence...
which
says:
"this
section
shall
not
apply
to
claims
involving
any
dispute
concerning
the
interpretation
or
application
of
any
collective
bargaining
agreement.
"
if
it
interpreted
that
sentence
to
mean
that
it
shall
not
apply
to
claims
involving
any
dispute,
as
opposed
to
claims
that
are
undisputed
as
in
this
case,
suppose
we
were
to
say
it
would
be
okay
in
that
event,
so
that
the
only
cases
you
don't
provide
representation
are
cases
where
there
is
a
real
dispute
about
the
amount
due,
could
you
live
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
practical
matter,
would
it
be
implementable?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cadell,
your...
i
don't
know
what
your
authority
for
your
description
of
california
law
is.
the
only
california
court
case
you
cite
to
us
is...
on
this
issue,
any
way,
is
howard,
and
howard
doesn't
say
what
you
say
it
says.
howard
also
uses
the
word
"dispute".
the
circumstances
of
the
case
at
bench
involved
a
dispute
concerning
the
application
of
a
cba.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
quote--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
quote
from
posner
says
"any
controversy
under
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
controversy
on
that.
the
only
controversy
is
whether
the
penalty
is
due,
and
that's
a
controversy
under
state
law
apart
from
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
that...
i
would
feel
that
i'm
slandering
the
california
supreme
court
if
i
accepted
as
california
law
what
you
tell
us
is
california
law.
now,
maybe
it's
the...
maybe
it's
the
commissioner's
interpretation
of
california
law,
but
i'm--
