may
i
ask,
supposing
you
have
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
amount
due?
say
the
employee
is
fired
on
friday,
just
bing,
and
there's
an
argument
about
whether
he
worked
6
hours
or
8
hours
on
wednesday.
how
does
the...
california
resolve
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
player...
the
employer
has
underpaid
him,
as
a
based
on
that,
then
there's
a
penalty
imposed.

and
then

the
penalty.

mr.
mccracken,
would
you
clear
up
one
thing
for
me.
she
has
not...
under
your
theory,
has
not
gotten
the
benefit
of
the
state's
handling
of
her
claim.
has...
does
she
have
any
other
remedy
other
than...
does
she
lose
the
claim
as
well
as
the
representation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
she
did
proceed
in
court,
would
her
attorney's
fees
be
assessed
against
the
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
has
a
find
a
lawyer
who's
willing
to
take
a
case
involving
3
day's
pay
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
would
you
have
done
if
there
were
no
collective
bargaining...
what
if
she
was
a
nonunion
employee,
how
would
you
find
out
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--supposing
it's
an
oral...
you
know,
just
an
oral...
at
will
oral
contract,
what
do
you
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
opponent
has
more
or
less
represented
to
us
that
normally
there's
no
big
deal
about
figuring
out
how
much
is
correct.
is
that
your
experience?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
most
cases
there
is
a
dispute
about
the
amount.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
most
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
customary
notice
specify
the
amount
claimed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
they're...
if
the
employer
would
recognize
that
it's
probably
correct,
they
would
not
answer
and
that
would
be
the
judgment
in
that
amount,
or
something
like
that.
