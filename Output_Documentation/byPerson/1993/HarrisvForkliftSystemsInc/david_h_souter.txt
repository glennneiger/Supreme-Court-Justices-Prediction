do
you
take
the
position
that
there
should
be
no
requirement
of
proof
of
subjective
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
positing
it
because
you
don't...
you
would
have
us
adopt
a
test
without
any
subjective
element
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
as
i
understand
your
view,
the
employee
would
not
have
to
prove
that
job
performance
was
in
fact
affected
deleteriously.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
have
both
an
objective
and
a
subjective
component
to
"make
more
difficult"?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
that
predicating
liability
with
an
injury?
you're
saying...
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
equivalent
of
saying
anyone
who
drives
a
car
without
due
care
is
going
to
be
liable
whether
or
not
he
bumps
into
somebody
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
difficulty
in
doing
the
job
is
simply
a...
is
an
objective
test,
and
the
failure
of
an
employee
to
work
as
well
under
this
discriminatory
atmosphere
as
without
it
is
simply
relevant
evidence,
it's
not
an
element
of
anything.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he...
didn't
he
do
that,
and
isn't
the
difficulty
with
your
argument
both
on
this
and
other
quotes
that
you
make,
that
the
magistrate
did
this
in
the
course
of
a
paragraph
in
which...
and
i'm
referring,
by
the
way
to
pages
a-35...
a-33
and
34
of
the
appendix.
he
did
this
in
a
paragraph
in
which
he
is
discussing
the
requirement
of
offending
the
reasonable
woman,
and
so
that
it's
perfectly
true
that
at
one
point
he
refers
simply
to
interfering
with
work
performance,
but
he
does
it,
as
it
were,
in
the
same
breath,
albeit
in
a
different
sentence
from
the
one
in
which
he
is
referring
to
seriously
affecting
psychological
well-being,
and
he
seems
to
be
in
effect
conflating
the
two,
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
separate
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
this
is
the
cert
appendix.
of
the
petition?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
certiorari.
the
cert
petition.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
doesn't
the
positioning
of
these
sentences
indicate
that
he
thinks
he's
applying
one
element
of
the
test,
not
two
different
tests
or
two
different
elements?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
there's
any
doubt
about
that,
we
should
send
it
back,
shouldn't
we,
if
we
don't
accept
the
psychological
injury
test?
