mr.
irwin
venick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
calls
upon
this
court
to
determine
whether
psychological
injury
is
a
necessary
requirement
for
a
finding
of
hostile
environment
liability
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
district
court
found
that
teresa
harris
was
subjected
to
a
continuing
pattern
of
sex-based
derogatory
conduct
that
was
not
imposed
upon
men
by
the
president
of
forklift.
the
conduct
was
found
to
be
unwelcome,
offensive
to
mrs.
harris,
and
would
have
offended
a
reasonable
person
in
her
position.
ms.
harris'
claims
were
dismissed
in
the
trial
court
and
summarily
affirmed
on
appeal
based
upon
the
sixth
circuit
rule
requiring
psychological
injury.
in
meritor
savings
bank
v.
vinson,
this
court
stated
that
a
hostile
work
environment
exists
if
conduct
is
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive
to
alter
the
conditions
of
employment
and
create
an
abusive
working
environment.
this
court
rejected
the
view
that
title
vii
was
limited
to
tangible
or
economic
discrimination,
and
further
observed
that
title
vii
affords
employees
the
right
to
work
free
from
sex-based
discriminatory
insult
and
ridicule.
the
psychological
injury
test
should
be
rejected
because
it
conditions
liability
in
a
title
vii
case
upon
the
reaction
of
the
victim
of
discriminatory
conduct
in
the
workplace,
rather
than
the
effect
of
that
conduct
on
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
it
therefore
does
not
further
the
equal
employment
opportunity
goals
of
title
vii.
because
the
district
court's
findings
satisfy
the
meritor
standard,
ms.
harris
requests
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
irwin
venick
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
there
is
a
subjective
element
in
the
unwelcomeness
requirement.
mr.
irwin
venick
but
beyond
that,
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
there
were
findings
that
there
was
both
subjective
harm,
and
that
ms.
harris
was
also
subjected
to
conduct
that
would
have
offended
a
reasonable
person
in
her
position,
so
that's
not
a
question
that
this
court
needs
to
reach
in
this
case.
but
with
respect
to
clarifying
the
meritor
decision,
it's
our
position
that
the
meritor
test
should
be
clarified
to
the
extent
that
existing
societal
stereotypes
should
not
be
the
standard
against
which
hostile
environment
claims
are
evaluated.
in
my
argument,
i
will
first
turn
to
the
specific
conduct
that
was
found
by
the
district
court.
i
will
then
discuss
why
the
psychological
injury
test
should
not
be
required
for
a
finding
of
a
hostile
work
environment,
and
finally,
i
will
argue
that
forklift's
test
neither
concedes
the
psychological
injury
requirement,
nor
comports
with
the
test
announced
by
this
court
in
meritor.
the
magistrate
below
found
that
charles
hardy
was
a
crude
and
vulgar
man
who
demeans
female
employees
in
his
workplace.
through
his
conduct,
charles
hardy
questioned
the
competence
of
teresa
harris
because
she
was
a
woman.
he
made
statements
to
her
in
the
midst
of
meetings
of
her
fellow
employees,
"you're
a
woman.
"
"what
do
you
know?
"
he
would
also
call
her
on
numerous
occasions
a
"dumb-ass
woman,
again
within
the
midst
of
her
fellow
employees.
"
"he
also
questioned
ms.
harris'
accomplishments
as
a
rental
manager,
again
because
she
was
a
woman.
"
"he--
"
mr.
irwin
venick
--yes,
your
honor?
mr.
irwin
venick
your
honor,
those
comments
may
be
characterized
more
properly
as
sex-based
comments,
but
still
we
believe
fall
within
the
sexual
harassment--
mr.
irwin
venick
--they
have,
your
honor,
and
in
addition,
in
their
1990
guidelines,
the
eeoc
sets
forth
a
separate
category
which
it
characterizes
as
sex-based
comments,
but
does
not
remove
them
from
its
general
rules
regarding
the
analysis
of
a
sexual
harassment
case.
mr.
hardy
also
directed--
mr.
irwin
venick
--under
the
wording
of
title
vii,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
you
would,
because
you're
not
being
discriminated
because
of
your
sex.
now,
if
there
were
male
pictures
put
up
on
the
walls,
perhaps
you
might
have
a
claim.
mr.
irwin
venick
title
vii
protects
employees
against
discrimination
as
to
the
terms
and
conditions
in
their
employment
because
of
their
sex.
in
this
case,
the
conduct
that
mr.
hardy
conducted
and
which
was
found
by
the
trial
court
in
our
view
exposed
teresa
harris
to
conduct
that
discriminated
against
her
because
of
her
sex.
all
these
comments,
all
this
conduct,
was
directed
only
at
women,
only
at
teresa
harris,
not
at
men,
and
therefore
we
believe
it
falls
squarely
within
title
vii.
mr.
irwin
venick
i
believe
in
that
case,
your
honor,
if
he
treated
everyone
equally,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
teresa
harris
may
not
have
had
a
claim.
mr.
irwin
venick
that's
right,
because
he's
not
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
sex.
mr.
hardy
also--
mr.
irwin
venick
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
again,
your
honor,
if
mr.
hardy
perhaps
directed
all
these
comments
towards
men,
then
the
males
at
the
workplace
may
have
had
a
claim,
and
not
teresa
harris.
but
mr....
in
getting
back
to
your
question--
mr.
irwin
venick
--well--
[laughter]
--your
honor,
not
only
in
my
family
but
in
the
courtrooms
as
well.
going
back
to
your
comment,
justice
ginsburg,
there
were
comments
and
conduct
directed
by
mr.
hardy
that
had
a
sexual
connotation.
he
would
ask
only
female
employees
to
remove
coins
from
his
front
pants
pocket.
he
would
only
ask
female
employees
to
pick
up
coins
on
the
floor
and
then
make
comments
about
their
physical
attributes.
mr.
irwin
venick
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
in
that
case
that
specific
factual
situation
would
fall
within
the
sex-based
criterion
under
meritor.
we
don't
have
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex,
we
have
comments
or
conduct
and
discussions
that
involve
sex.
mr.
irwin
venick
if
the
conduct,
your
honor,
is
directed
towards
the
female
employee--
mr.
irwin
venick
--if
the
conduct
is
found
under
meritor
to
be
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive
to
alter
the
conditions
of
that
employee's
work
environment,
yes,
that
would
be
a
hostile
work
environment.
mr.
irwin
venick
well,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
the
lower
courts
about
that
standard.
in
our
brief...
again,
we
don't
really...
perhaps
don't
need
to
get
to
that
point
in
this
case,
but
in
our
brief
we've
characterized
it
as
a
reasonable
person
in
the
position
of
the
plaintiff,
recognizing
that
hostile
environment
claims
can
be
brought
by
both
men
or
women.
it
is
our
view,
though,
that
if
the
court
decides
to
address
that
question
and
wants
to
fashion
a
test,
that
what
the
court
needs
to
bear
in
mind
is,
what
is
the
goal
that
we're
trying
to
achieve,
and
i
think
that
goal
can
be
perceived
in
two
ways.
first,
it
is
essential
that
existing
societal
stereotypes
be
eliminated
from
consideration
of
workplace
conduct,
and
secondly,
we
have
to
look
towards
the
goals
and
objectives
of
title
vii,
which
is
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
the
workplace,
and
i
think
if
the
court
is
the
address
that
point,
i
would
suggest
that
it
look
at
it
from
those
two
principles.
mr.
irwin
venick
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reasonable
employer
is
the
person
who
is
perpetrating
the
conduct.
in
our
view--
mr.
irwin
venick
--mr.
chief
justice,
title
vii
is
intended
by
its
very
language
to
protect
employees
from
discriminatory
conduct
in
the
workplace.
it
would
therefore
be
our
view
that--
mr.
irwin
venick
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
focus
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
employees,
and
it
would
therefore
seem
in
our
view
that
the
perspective
should
be
from
the
perspective
of
the
plaintiff
or
the
victim.
mr.
irwin
venick
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
a
number
of
the
amici
that
have
filed
briefs
have
pointed
out
one
of
the
problems
with
the
reasonableness
standard,
and
that
is
that
it's
not
found
expressly
in
the
language
of
title
vii.
however,
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
its
language
in
meritor
that...
to
the
effect
that
a
mere
insult
would
not
give
rise
to
title
vii
liability,
and
in
our
view
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
imported
and
implied
a
reasonableness
standard
to
take
into
consideration
that
limiting
factor
that
this
court
announced
in
meritor.
mr.
irwin
venick
your
honor,
that
would
create
a
problem
in
the
context
of
this
case,
because
mr.
hardy
believed
that
he
was
acting
reasonably.
he
believed
that
his
conduct
was--
mr.
irwin
venick
--we
would
hope
he
might
be
found
to
have
been
very
wrong,
but--
mr.
irwin
venick
--that's
correct,
if
his
conduct
is
found
to
be
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive
to
alter
the
working
environment,
and
it's
our
view
that
that
perspective
needs
to
be
from
the
perspective
of
the
employee,
because
it's
the
employee
who's
subjected
to
the
conduct.
the
employer
is
the
one
who
is
causing
the
conduct,
and
it's
the
employee
who
is
the
one
who
is
going
to
be
complaining
about
it.
it's
our
view
that
any
test--
mr.
irwin
venick
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
but
even
in
the
situation
where
all
employers
are
presumed
to
know
the
law,
as
charles
hardy
was
presumed
to
know
the
law,
they
ofttimes,
or
sometimes
don't
act
in
accordance
with
the
law,
and
that's
why,
from
our
perspective,
it's
the
employee
who
has
the
interest
in
bringing
forth
actions
under
title
vii
to
enforce
the
law,
and
that's
why
from
our
view
that
is
the
employee's
perspective,
if
the
court's
going
to
reach
that
point,
that
should
be
utilized
in
analyzing
these
facts.
it's
our
view
that
any
test
that
requires
psychological
injury
as
a
necessary
element
of
proof
to
establish
a
sexually
hostile
work
environment
does
not
further
the
objectives
of
title
vii
to
eliminate
discriminatory
conduct
because
of
an
employee's
sex.
the
psychological
injury
test
requires
such
an
employer...
or
employee
to
endure
discriminatory
conduct
without
a
remedy,
and
that
results
for
two
reasons:
first,
because
employment
conditions
can
be
altered
by
severe
or
pervasive
workplace
conduct
before
any
kind
of
psychological
injury
manifests
itself,
and
secondly
because
the
psychological
injury
threshold
itself
may
insulate
unlawful
activity
if
employees
leave
their
employment
rather
than
suffer
continued
workplace
harassment
because
of
their
sex.
mr.
irwin
venick
i'll
do
that
right
now,
your
honor.
forklift
suggests
a
test
in
its
brief,
that
the
test
that
satisfies
meritor,
the
only
test
that
satisfies
meritor,
is
that
the
plaintiff
must
show
interference
with
his
or
her
work
performance,
and
that
test
can
only
be
satisfied
in
one
of
two
ways:
either
psychological
injury,
or
an
inability
to
do
the
job.
it's
our
position
that
obviously
psychological
injury
as
a
means
of
satisfying
the
interference
to
impair
work
performance
means
psychological
injury.
it
is
hard
for
us
to
concede
how,
or
conceive
of
how
a
worker
may
be
unable
to
do
their
job
without
manifesting
some
degree
of
psychological
injury.
it
seems
to
be
a
circular
argument
saying
one
and
the
same
thing,
and
therefore,
in
our
view,
they
basically
back-door
the
psychological
injury
requirement
and
put
it
in
new
garb.
mr.
irwin
venick
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
that
test
is
necessary
for
a
finding
of
hostile
work
environment.
it's
our
belief
that
this
court
under
meritor
set
forth
a
proper
standard,
and
that
is
that
the
conduct
should
be
evaluated
to
determine
whether
it
is
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive
to
alter
the
conditions
of
the
workplace,
and
that
can
involve
a
whole
range
of
effects,
and
to
try
to
categorize
them--
mr.
irwin
venick
--again,
we
would
need
to,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
try
to
quantify
what
that
difficulty
is,
and
we
harken
back
to
the
language
in
meritor
that
title...
hostile
environment
cases
don't
involve
tangible
or
economic
injury.
mr.
irwin
venick
we
don't
believe
it
is
necessarily
more
complex
if
the
conduct
is
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive.
it
is
difficult,
and
i
don't
think
title
vii
was
intended
to
require
a
plaintiff
to
quantify
any
reduction
in
their
job
performance.
mr.
irwin
venick
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
believe
you
have
to
go
any
further
and
put
a
label
on
it,
making
it
more
difficult
for
her
to
do
that
job.
her
terms
and
conditions
have
been
affected
in
violation
of
title
vii
because
she
has
been
subjected--
mr.
irwin
venick
--that's
the
language
in
meritor,
your
honor,
which
we
heartily
embrace.
mr.
irwin
venick
in
evaluating
whether
conduct
is
severe
or
pervasive,
one
would
look
through
the
factors
that
have
been
adopted
by
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
in
the
eeoc--
mr.
irwin
venick
--the
factors,
your
honor,
that
would
be
applied
to
make
a
determination,
is
how
often
does
the
conduct
occur,
whose
perpetrating
the
conduct,
who
else
was
exposed
to
the
conduct,
who
else
joined
into
the
conduct?
mr.
irwin
venick
that
is
a
determination--
mr.
irwin
venick
--the
interference
with
work
performance
test
would
require
a
plaintiff
to
quantifiably
prove
some
reduction
in
job
performance
which
goes
beyond--
mr.
irwin
venick
--which...
but
it
also
goes
beyond--
mr.
irwin
venick
--that's
what
that...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
venick
that's
what
that--
mr.
irwin
venick
--we're
not
positing
that
test,
your
honor.
that's
the
test
that--
mr.
irwin
venick
--we
believe
that
the
court
can
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
venick
that
is--
mr.
irwin
venick
--yes,
i
did,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
irwin
venick
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
there
would
not
have
to
be
proof
that
there
was
a
quantifiable
reduction
in
job
performance
by
the
plaintiff.
thank
you
very--
