mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
situation
that
is
somewhat
peculiar.
we
concede
that
the
rabidue
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
requires
severe
psychological
injury
is
a
test
that
is
too
stringent.
however,
having
said
that,
we
also
assert
that
that
rabidue
case
was
decided
on
another
independent
ground.
now,
we
agree
that
the
rabidue
case
is
wrong
in
the
requirement
of
severe
psychological
injury,
but
the
magistrate
clearly
applied
the
test
of
whether
or
not
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
interfered
with
the
work
performance
of
the
petitioner.
now,
stopping
at
that
point,
that's
what
the
eeoc
says
in
their
brief
should
be
the
standard.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
if
we
take
the
fact
that
all
offensive
conduct
and
all
things
that
may
be
characterized
as
harassment
are
not...
do
not
enable
you
to
seek
redress
under
title
vii,
which
is
what
the
meritor
case
says,
there
are
acts
that
can
be
characterized
as
harassment
but
don't
rise
to
the
level
of
allowing
you
to
obtain
successfully
redress
for
what
you
complain
of.
now,
as
i
read
a-34
and
35,
beginning
on
a-33,
he
says...
he
discusses
offensiveness.
he
says,
"i
believe
some
of
hardy's
inappropriate
sexual
comments
are--
"
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--yes,
a-33
of
the
appendix,
excuse
me.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
or
the
petition
for
writ.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
it's
the
cert
petition,
a-33.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
excuse
me.
may
i
proceed?
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
at
a-33
he
says,
"i
believe
that
some
of
hardy's
inappropriate
sexual
comments,
especially
this
last
one,
offended
plaintiff
and
would
offend
a
reasonable
woman.
"
so
he
finds
that
indeed...
he
found
the
conduct
offensive,
and
that
it
would
offend
a
reasonable
woman.
then
he
says,
"however,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
were
so
severe
as
to
be
expected
to
seriously
affect
plaintiff's
psychological
well-being.
"
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
well,
i...
that
is
not
the
way
i
read
it,
because
when
he
starts
the
next
paragraph,
which
is
a
new
thought--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--if
there
is
any
doubt
in
this
honorable
court's
mind
as
to
whether
the
magistrate
focused
clearly
on
all
of
the
tests
that
have
been
enunciated
as
opposed
to
focusing
on
the
psychological
injury
test--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
he's
free
to
ignore
it,
and
indeed,
i
don't
believe
he
did
ignore
it.
what
i
believe
the
magistrate
did
was
try
to
apply
all
of
the
tests,
the
rabidue
case
from
sixth
circuit,
the
eeoc
guidelines,
together
with
the
language
of...
that
came
out
of
meritor,
which
included--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
it's...
you
necessarily
have
to
assume
that
he
stopped
at
that
point.
i
think
that
he
covered
what
the
sixth
circuit
says,
and
then
went...
proceeded
beyond
that
to
apply--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--i
don't
believe
that
he
used
the
word,
alternative,
but
in
reading
at
a-34
and
a-35,
particularly
i
think
at
a-35,
where
he
says,
"although
hardy
may
at
times
have
genuinely
offended
plaintiff,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
created
a
working
environment
so
poisoned
as
to
be
intimidating
or
abusive
to
plaintiff.
"
and
i
believe
that
he
was
trying
to
apply
the
exact
language
out
of
meritor,
so
i
think
that
he
applied
rabidue,
and
then
went
beyond
rabidue.
now,
if...
if
we
agree
that
psychological
injury
should
not
have
to
be
proven,
i
again
state
to
you
that
i
believe
that
in
this
case
the
magistrate
applied
every
test
that
he
could
have
applied,
including
what
the
eeoc
says
to
apply,
which
is
interfere
with
a
reasonable
person's
work
performance
or
victim's
performance,
the
meritor,
which
i
just
recited
that
he
said,
and
that
the
psychological
injury
doesn't
tie
in
and
that
his
thought
process
was
not
infected...
the
petitioner
says
that
his
thought
process
was
infected
by
the
rabidue
case,
and
i
say
that
it
wasn't.
now
there's
one--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
yes,
and
interesting
enough,
your
honor,
is
that
the--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--i
agree
that
that's
what
the
petitioner
asserts.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
and
i
say
to
you
that
the
eeoc...
we
agree
with
the
eeoc,
who
says
that
the
standard
should
be
related
to
work
performance,
that
the
eeoc
and
my
side
of
the
case
agree.
now,
the
meritor
case
also
points--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
i
believe
that
when
he
stated
this
was
a
close
case,
that
what
he
was
talking
about
was
the
totality
of
the
case,
all
of
the
circumstances,
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses...
as
we
all
know,
events
don't
take
place
in
a
vacuum,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
really
helpful
things
that
comes
out
of
meritor,
in
addition
to
the
test
that
it
states,
is
the
totality
of
circumstance
statement,
where
meritor
says
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
that
the
trier
of
fact
must
determine
the
existence
of
sexual
harassment
in
light
of
the
record
as
a
whole,
and
the
totality
of
circumstances
such
as
the
nature
of
the
sexual
advances
and
the
context
in
which
the
alleged
incidents
occurred.
now,
the
reason
i
state
that
is
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
this
case--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--he
has
found
a
continuing
pattern
of
derogatory
conduct,
and
he
is
trying
to
determine
from
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
this
case,
and
he
went
to
events
that
are
extrinsic
to
the
simple
words
that
were
said,
and
what
the
petitioner
says,
how
they
affected
her.
he
went
to
a
number
of
incidents
that
caused
him
to
wonder
if,
indeed...
if,
indeed,
she
was
basing
this
case
on
what
she
was
asserting
or
whether,
for
example,
the
business
relationship
that
soured
with
her
husband
had
more--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--i
think
that
when
you
try
to...
in
order
to
answer...
that
is
a
very
difficult
question
to
ask...
to
answer,
because
one
racial
epithet,
it's
been
ruled
as
not
enough.
i
don't
think
i
can
give
you--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--yes,
that
is
true,
but
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
i
can't
give
you
a
mathematical
formula,
but
i
can
again--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--my
answer
to
that
question
is
that
i
believe
that
is
the
same.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
i
believe
the
monsanto
was
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
i
believe
that
that's
accurate,
and
i
agree
that
they
shouldn't
be
distinguished,
but
again
i
state
that
if
you
go
to
the
meritor
case,
the
meritor
case
refers
to
the
gauntlet
of
sexual
harassment,
sexual
demeaning
remarks,
so
it's
not
only
whatever
happens...
the
meritor
case
recognizes
this.
it's
not
only
what
happens
in
work
performance
as
that
victim
sits
at
her
desk,
but
what
she
has
to
go
through
to
get
to
her
desk,
and
that's
a
question
of
degree.
that's
why
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
all
of
the
attending
facts
become
so
important.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
well,
because--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--the
eeoc--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--the
eeoc
states
a
sexually...
this
is
in
their
brief
at
page
25.
"a
sexually
demeaning
work
environment
can
interfere
with
a
reasonable
woman
manager's
work
performance.
"
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
well,
they
state
in
describing...
well,
the
focus...
i
believe
that
the
eeoc's
position
is
this:
that
the
focus
of
title
vii
is
on
the
employment
opportunity
and
whether
or
not
the
party
complains
employment
opportunity...
that
is
to
succeed
and
to
do
the
job--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--is
adversely
affected.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
well,
the
fact--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--yes.
yes,
and
the
reason
that
i
disagree
is
that
i
don't
think
that
offensive
conduct
automatically
alters
conditions
of
employment.
i
think
that
you
can
have
offensive
conduct
that
just
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
that
this
law
seeks
to
protect,
and
that
is
your
employment
opportunity
and
whether
a
condition...
whether
there's
a
condition
imposed,
or
there's
an
alteration
that
rises
to
the
level
where
you
can
seek
redress
successfully.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
and
i
believe
that's
offensive,
but
i
don't
believe--
[laughter]
--but
i
don't
believe
it
rises
to
the
level--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--i
don't
believe
it
rises
to
the
level
where
the
law
is
intended
to
protect
you
and
give
you
redress.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
yes,
and
in
regard
to
the
tangible,
the
magistrate
found
that
she...
indeed,
the
petitioner
suffered
no
injury,
he
said,
of
any
kind
whatsoever,
whether
it
be
tangible
or
intangible,
that
really
she
didn't...
she
wasn't
adversely
affected.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
well,
i
may
have
misspoken
on
that,
because
i
do
feel
that
one
of
the
ways
to
offer
evidence
to
establish
that
indeed
the
discrimination
that
you're
suffering
rises
to
the
level
is
to
show
that
you
have
to
go
through
a
gauntlet
to
get
to
your
desk,
or
when
you
get
to
your
desk
you're
adversely
affected.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
i
think
that
it
is...
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
specifically
assert
and
prove
interference
with
your
work
performance
in
order
to
be
successful.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
in
all
circumstances
you
would
have
to
prove
that--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--because
i
think--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--no,
i
believe
that
that
is
an
essential
element,
but
under
certain
circumstances,
for
instance--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--the
reason
that
i
can't
state
that
it
is
an
absolute
essential
element
is
because
that
was
never
mentioned
in
the
meritor
case,
which
is
the
only
case
that
we
have
from
this
court
to
give
us
guidance.
the
work
performance
was
not
mentioned
in
the
meritor
case.
it
was
the
altered
conditions
and
the
hostile
environment
conjunctively,
and
therefore,
if
i
say
that
it
is
an
absolute
essential
that
you
prove
that
in
order
to
win,
i'm
saying
something
that
has
not
been
stated
by
this
court.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
well,
the
issue
that's
been
presented
by
this
case
and
why
i'm
here
is
whether
or
not
psychological
damage,
severe
psychological
damage
has
to
be
proven
by
the
petitioner,
and
i...
and
i
say
to
you
i
don't
believe
that
the
magistrate
rested
this
case
on
that
finding,
and
i
concede--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--i
say--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--i
think
because
the
magistrate
applied
the
language
and
test
of
the
meritor
case,
which
is
the
only
case
we
have.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
well,
if
he
applied
every
test,
including
the
meritor
test,
which
i
say
that
he
did,
then
how
could
he
be
clearly
erroneous
on
the
standards
that
he
applied?
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
at
a-35
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
he
says,
"although
hardy
may
at
times
have
genuinely
offended
plaintiff,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
created
a
working
environment
so
poisoned
as
to
be
intimidating
or
abusive
to
plaintiff.
"
and
i
believe
that
under
meritor,
that
is
the
conjunctive
part
where
meritor
says,
"for
sexual
harassment
to
be
actionable
it
must
be
sufficiently
severe
or
persuasive
to
alter
the
conditions
of
the
victim's
employment
and
create
an
abusive
working
environment.
"
and
i
believe
that
that
language
on
page
a-35
was
the
magistrate's
attempt
to
comply
with
the
only
case
we
have
giving
us
guidance,
which
is
meritor.
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
the
magistrate
i
believe
said,
to
a
reasonable
woman
manager
in
this
position.
i
believe
that
the
reasonable
person
test
is
the
proper
test
if--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--which--
mr.
stanley
m.
chernau
--the
confines
of
that
paragraph,
i
would
agree
with
you,
it
does
not.
i
do
think,
if
i
could
quickly
make
this
point,
that
the
proper
test
is
the
reasonable
person
test,
because
what
we're
looking
at
under
this
law
is
the
effect
of
the
complained-of
conduct
on
the
party
that's
aggrieved.
i
don't
think
that
we're
looking
into
the
character
of
what
was
done
as
much
as
we're
trying
to
assess
what
the
consequences
or
the
effect
of
that
conduct
was,
and
i
believe
that
what
i
just
stated
comports
with
the
eeoc
guidelines
and
what
the
eeoc
believes
in
this
case,
so
again,
this
is
a
difficult
situation.
a
hostile
environment
is
such
an
amorphous
subject
that
it's
very
difficult,
and
as
i
said,
you
can't
reduce
it
to
a
mathematical
formula.
each
case
i
believe
has
to
be
decided
on
the
facts
of
that
case,
that
these
cases
are
fact-intensive,
they
are
not
easy
to
decide,
and
the
trier
of
the
fact
indeed
has
to
look
to
the
totality
of
all
of
the
circumstances,
just
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
meritor
case,
which
i
think
is
a
very,
very,
very
valid
and
necessary
observation
for
this
court
to
have
had
to
make,
and
which,
indeed,
it
did.
i
have
no--
