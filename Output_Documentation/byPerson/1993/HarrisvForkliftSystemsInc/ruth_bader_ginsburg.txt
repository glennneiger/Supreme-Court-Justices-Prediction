mr.
venick--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
respect
to
those
comments
that
you
just
quoted,
does
the
sexual
harassment
caption
really
fit
those?
that
has
a
connotation
that
perhaps
is
not
quite
right,
to
describe
the
comments
that
you
just
referred
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
hasn't
the
eeoc
picked
up
on
word
gender
to
try
to
distinguish
that
kind
of
comment
from
the
sexual
harassment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some
of
these
are
hard
to
transpose
in
that
way.
you're
a
woman,
what
do
you
know,
means
something
different
if
you
say
you're
a
man,
what
do
you
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
positing
a
reasonable
employer
who
has
been
educated
and
made
aware,
not...
for
example,
a
reasonable
employer
in
the
old
days
might
have
thought
it
was
perfectly
fine
to
say
all
kinds
of
unpleasant
things
to
women.
even
great
professors
had
such
things
as
ladies
day,
and
in
their
day
they
were
considered
entirely
reasonable,
so
we're
positing
a
reasonable
employer
who
knows
the
law,
knows
the
command,
thou
shalt
not
discriminate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
do
you
define
interfere
with
work
performance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
just
saying
it
makes
the
job
more
difficult
for
the
person?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
if
you
take
a
similarly
situated
man
and
a
woman,
and
the
woman
is
constantly
told,
you're
a
woman,
you
think
like
a
woman,
and
her
coworker
is
not
told
those
things?
doesn't
that
make
their
job
more
difficult?
do
you
need
anything
further
than
that?
is
it
really
more
complex?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
about
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
and
the
terms
and
conditions
aren't
equal
if
one
is
being
called
names
and
the
other
isn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
seem
to
be
developing
a
more
complex
test,
and
i
was
wondering
why?
you
said
severe,
and
pervasive,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
asked
you
what
you
thought
it
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
you
have
to
show
that
the
quality
of
work
is
different,
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
output
is
different,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
the
test
to
do
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
remedy
could
be
simply,
stop
it,
without
any...
talking
about
somebody
who
says
the
job
is
more
difficult
for
me
to
perform
than
the
next
guy...
not
asking
for
any
money,
and
just
says,
the
remedy
is
an
injunctive
order
to
stop
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
what
about
the
woman
who
doesn't
see
herself
as
a
victim,
but
finds
this
terribly
annoying.
it's
a
condition
that
she
has
to
confront
every
day,
and
she
puts
up
with
it.
she
outperforms
everyone
else.
does
she
not
have
a
claim?
i'm
not
following
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
even
though
she
proves
no
psychological
harm,
and
that
she
has
been
able
to
do
the
job
as
well,
indeed,
better
than
her
coworkers--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whether
one
sex
has
to
put
up
with
something
that
the
other
sex
doesn't
have
to
put
up
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chernau,
the
magistrate
set
out...
and
this
is
a-29
and
a-30
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari...
set
out
marching
orders
from
the
sixth
circuit
and
one
of
those,
number
4,
says,
"offensive
work
environment
that
affected
seriously
the
psychological
well-being
of
the
plaintiff.
"
that's
a
requirement
set
down
by
the
sixth
circuit.
is
a
magistrate
free
to
ignore
that
and
say,
well...
he
says,
i'm
purporting
to
follow
this
rule.
that
is
the
law
of
the
sixth
circuit.
is
a
magistrate
free
to
say,
well,
i
don't
like
that
so
i'm
going
to
ignore
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
agree
that
the
sixth
circuit
has
said
this
is
not
merely
a
sufficient
condition
for
liability,
it's
a
necessary
condition,
part
of
plaintiff's
proof...
plaintiff
must
prove
serious
psychological
well-being.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
that's
the
law
of
the
sixth
circuit,
mustn't
we
assume
that
that's
what
the
magistrate
applied?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
do
you
find
a
clear
statement
that
there's
an
alternative
ruling
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chernau,
this
magistrate
said
this
is
a
close
case.
if
he
regards
it
as
a
close
case,
then
if
the
standard
is
not
as
hard
to
meet
as
the
sixth
circuit
stated...
seriously
affects
psychological
well-being...
and
the
magistrate
regards
it
as
a
close
case,
isn't
it
likely
that
if
the
standard
were
less
strict
for
the
plaintiff,
that
the
case
would
go
the
other
way?
you
read
one
sentence
out
of...
what
is
this
one
in
your
appendix,
over
40
pages--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
one
concentrates
on,
i
believe
this
is
a
close
case,
and
then
the
judge
is
told,
well,
the
standard
is
easier
for
the
plaintiff
to
meet
than
you
think,
then
wouldn't
the
close
case
tip
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it...
the
magistrate
made
a
finding,
"plaintiff
was
the
object
of
a
continuing
pattern
of
sex-based
derogatory
conduct
from
hardy,
including.
"
and
then
he
goes
on
and
on
for
a
few
pages,
so
he's
found
a
pattern,
a
continuing
pattern
of
derogatory
conduct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't
make
any
finding
on
that.
mr.
chernau,
i'm
curious,
if
this
had
finding,
instead
of
plaintiff
was
the
object
of
a
continuing
pattern
of
sex-based
derogatory
conduct,
if
it
had
been
race-based
or
religion-based
or
national
origin,
and
we
had
a
similar
inventory
of
continuous
behavior,
would
your
analysis
be
any
different
than...
is
the
sex
analysis
any
different
from
one
if
we
had
race
or
national
origin-based
derogatory
continuing
conduct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
was
not
one
epithet
here,
there
was
a
whole
series
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
haven't
asked
you
for
a
formula.
i
asked
you
is...
in
your
judgment,
under
this
statute,
is
sex
different
than
race
or
national
origin
or
religion
in
terms
of
the
level
of
unpleasantness,
annoyance,
differential
treatment
based
on
race...
is
it
any
different
for
race,
or
is
the
test
the
same,
in
your
judgment,
whether
we're
talking
about
race,
or
national
origin,
or
religion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
the
monsanto
test
that
the...
i
think
it
was
the
sixth
circuit,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
the
one
that
they
applied
to
race,
that
would
apply
to
sex
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chernau,
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
davis
v.
monsanto
is
indeed...
you
told
me
that
yes,
that
standard
would
be
the
same,
and
one
of
the
things
the
sixth
circuit
said
in
that
1988
decision
was,
"in
establishing
the
requisite
adverse
effect
on
work
performance,
the
plaintiff
need
not
prove
that
his
or
her
tangible
productivity
has
declined
as
a
result
of
the
harassments.
"
are
you
agreeing
that
that
would
be
so
in
the
sex
case
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
that
you
understood
my
question.
i
asked
if
you
are
conceding
that
it
is
not
any
kind
of
part
of
the
plaintiff's
case
to
show
that
her
work
output
was
adversely
affected,
because
that's
the
standard
that
the
sixth
circuit
applies
in
racial
harassment
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
all
agree
on
what
would
be
sufficient.
the
question
is,
what's
necessary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
disagreed
with
this
standard
where
the
sixth
circuit
made
it
quite
plain
that
it
isn't
under
any
circumstances,
it's
not...
plaintiff
need
not
prove,
and
that's
why
i
asked
you,
because
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
you
were
associating
yourself
with
the
identical
standard...
it
is
the
same
statute,
title
vii.
what
applies
to
race
would
apply
to
gender,
right...
and
that
this
standard
says
that
that's
no
part
of
plaintiff's
case
to
prove
that
productivity
was
adversely
affected.
