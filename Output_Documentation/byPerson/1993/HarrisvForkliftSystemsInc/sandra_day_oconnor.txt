well,
you
certainly
could
have
a
hostile
working
environment
that
makes
it
very
difficult
for
the
female
employee
to
continue
to
work
there,
couldn't
you,
under
those
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
that
wasn't
the
assumption,
but
it
nonetheless
creates
a
hostile
working
environment.
justice

what
is
the
reasonable
person
standard
that
we
employ?
is
it
a
reasonable
woman,
or
a
reasonable
victim,
or
what
is
it?
there's
some
difference
in
the
views
of
different
courts
about
what
the
reasonable
person
standard
is,
isn't
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
said--
--but
that's
why
you
don't
posit
it.
i
thought
you
said
that
it
had
to
at
least
be
unwelcome,
that
there
was
a
subjective
component.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
you
say
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
minear,
if
the
employer
just
makes
it
more
difficult
for
everybody
to
do
the
job,
male
or
female--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
there
a
complaint?
is
there
a--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--cause
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me,
are
you
referring
to
the
joint
appendix,
to
some
page
in
it,
or
to
the
petition,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
thank
you.
