mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
held
in
meritor
savings
bank
v.
vinson
that
sexual
harassment
can
result
in
title
vii
discrimination
if
the
conduct
is
gender-based,
unwelcome,
and
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive
to
alter
the
conditions
of
the
victim's
employment.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
the
conduct
at
issue
was
gender-based
and
unwelcome.
instead,
the
question
is
whether
it
was
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive
to
satisfy
the
vinson
test.
we
think
that
a
plaintiff
can
satisfy
that
requirement
by
showing
that
the
gender-based
conduct
made
it
more
difficult
for
the
person
to
do
the
job.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
for
that
standard,
your
honor,
we
have
only
an
objective
component.
the
question
is
whether
it
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
a
reasonable
person
vis-a-vis
the
people
who
are
not
discriminated
in
the
workplace
to
do
the
work,
to
perform
the
job.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
the
injury
here,
your
honor,
is
with
respect
to
being
denied
the
right
to
a
discrimination-free
employment
place,
and
our
test
goes
to
whether
or
not
there
is
discrimination
in
the
workplace.
the
person
can
be
injured
even
though
the
person
does
not
have
compensable
damages.
in
fact,
until
recently,
title
vii
did
not
provide
a
damage
remedy.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
correct,
and...
but
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
severity
or
pervasiveness,
trying
to
understand
what
that
concept
means
in
the
workplace.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
exactly
correct.
now,
this
is
not
the
only
way
to
prove
that
conduct
might
be
severe
or
pervasive,
but
we
think
that
is
a
very
useful
benchmark
in
a
case
like
this,
because
it
helps
to
focus
the
inquiry
on
the
practical
effect
of
the
conduct
in
the
workplace.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
what
we
are--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--oh,
this
is
a
matter
of
proof
for
the
plaintiff,
but
suppose
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--suppose
the
plaintiff
had
clinical
psychosis
as
a
result
of
a
rape
in
the
workplace.
i
think
she
could
use
that
evidence
without
necessarily
needing
to
show
it
made
the
job
more
difficult
to
do.
it
almost
certainly
would,
but
again,
this
is
a
matter
of
choice
of
proof.
the
standard
is
set
forth
in
meritor,
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
standard
at
all,
that
is,
whether
it's
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive.
the
question
is,
how
does
the
plaintiff
go
about
proving
it,
and
we're
saying
that
one
way
you
can
prove
it--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
another
way
to--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--another
example
would
be,
for
instance,
let's
take
the
concrete
example
of
a
woman
who
drives
a
taxicab
for
a
taxi
company,
and
she
wants
to
work
in
the
shop.
she
wants
to
work
with
her
hands
and
be
a
mechanic.
in
that
case,
she
might
be
deterred
from
making
the
job
transfer
in
that
situation
because
there's
harassment
in
the
mechanic's
shop.
now,
that
wouldn't
interfere
with
her
current
job,
but
it
would,
in
fact
prohibit,
or
prevent
her
from
moving
to
a
different
job.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
she
does
have
a
claim
under
those
circumstances.
again,
annoyance,
pervasive
annoyance--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
she
would
still
have
a
claim,
because
our
test
is
an
objective
one.
we
look
to
what
a
reasonable
person
in
her
situation,
whether
or
not
that
person
is
disadvantaged,
vis-a-vis
people
who
are
not
subject
to
that
treatment.
now,
if
the
conduct
is
gender-based,
and
is
unwelcome,
then
we
move
on
to
that
question
of
whether
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
a
reasonable
person
in
her
situation
to
do
the
job.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that's
captured
by
our
notion
of
a
reasonable
person
in
the
position
of
the
plaintiff.
now,
we
accept
that
in
the
workplace
there's
a
certain
amount
of
unpleasantness
in
any
workplace,
and
that
people
become
accustomed
to
that
one
way
or
another.
we're
expected
as
a
matter...
society
expects
us
to
accept
a
certain
amount
of
unpleasantness,
but
the
question
is,
if
it
is
gender-based,
and
it
makes
it
more
difficult
to
do
the
job,
is
that
enjoinable,
and
title
vii
says,
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
could
be
relevant
evidence,
yes,
and
in
fact
we
think
the
correct
standard
was
stated
by
the
court
below
in
the
racial
harassment
context.
in
davis
v.
monsanto,
the
court
said,
and
i
quote,
"in
establishing
the
requisite
adverse
effect
on
work
performance,
the
plaintiff
need
not
prove
that
his
or
her
tangible
productivity
has
declined
as
a
result
of
the
harassment.
"
"the
employee
need
only
show
that
the
harassment
made
it
more
difficult
to
do
the
job.
"
now,
we
think
that
the
same
standard
should
apply
in
the
racial
and
the
sexual
context.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that
can
make
the
job
more
difficult
to
do.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
it's
helpful
to
look
in
response
to
this
to
the
facts
of
this
actual
case,
and
the
united
states
and
the
eeoc
believes
that
the
sex-based
abuse
that
occurred
in
this
case
provides
an
example
of
enjoinable
harassment.
hardy's
sexually
demeaning
conduct
clearly
created
a
work
environment
that
made
it
more
difficult
to
do
the
work,
to
succeed,
and
to
receive
credit
for
the
success.
now,
if
we
look
to
specifics
in
this
context,
hardy's
suggestion
in
front
of
others
that
petitioner
have
sex
with
a
customer
to
obtain
business
for
the
company
would
undermine
or
demoralize
a
reasonable
woman
by
degrading
her
in
front
of
her
coworkers,
and
also
by
denying
her
credit
for
results
achieved
through
superior
effort
or
skill.
now,
this
is
not
simply
a
hurt
feelings
situation.
in
the
case
of
a
manager
who
is
undermined
before
other
managers
and
before
her
subordinates,
it
makes
it
tangibly
more
difficult
for
her
to
do
the
job.
in
fact,
teresa
harris
made
the
statement
in--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
keep
in
mind,
your
honor...
yes,
there
is
a
violation,
and
it
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
again,
this
goes
back
to
my
point
of
saying
that
this
is
not
the
exclusive
test,
that
there
are
other
ways.
the
ultimate
touchstone
here
is
whether
it
affects
working
conditions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
mean,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--again,
let's
go
back
to...
again,
the
ultimate
touchstone
here
is
whether
it
alters
working
conditions.
meritor
indicated
that
is
the
question,
and
that
covers
justice
stevens'
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right,
but
it
can
also
make
it
more
difficult
to
do
the
job,
and
in
terms
of
teresa
harris'--
[laughter]
i
think
this
is
a
serious
point,
and
i
think...
and
i
want
to
make
this
point.
in
the
case
of
teresa
harris,
she
was
undermined
in
performing
her
work
in
the
eyes
of
her
subordinates.
she
made
the
point
that
her
authority
was
undermined
as
a
result
of
these
comments.
she
received
less
respect
in
the
workplace
from
her
subordinates
than
her...
male
managers
did.
now,
this
is
the
way
a
glass
ceiling
is
enforced,
and
this
is
a
very
tangible
way
in
which
the
ability
to
do
the
job
can
be
affected.
it
is
not
simply
hurt
feelings
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
might
be
correct,
but
the
question
here
is,
i
think
we're
looking
in
a
more
global
sense
of
whether
there
is
different
treatment
for
women
and
men
in
the
workplace.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
not
necessarily,
again,
it
doesn't,
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
helpful,
again
as
a
benchmark
here,
to
ask
whether
women
and
men
are
being
treated
differently
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
it
makes
it
more
difficult
to
do
the
job.
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
why
we
think
that
a
reasonable
person
standard
is
appropriate
in
this
context,
and
there
was
some
discussion
before
about
whether
we
looked
to
the
reasonable
woman,
the
reasonable
victim,
the
reasonable
man.
i
think
the
important
point
is
there
does
need
to
be
some
objective
measure
of
conduct
in
the
workplace.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
then
there
is
no
gender--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--then
there--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
that
situation
there
is
no
gender-based
discrimination,
and
so
the
first
factor
in
meritor
is
not
satisfied.
thank
you,
your
honor.
