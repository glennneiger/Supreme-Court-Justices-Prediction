justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
venick,
suppose
i'm
a
male
employee
and
i
am
as
offended
by
language
and
conduct
like
that
as
a
female
employee,
or
as
offended
by
the
posting
of
really
scatological
pictures
and
whatnot
around
the
workplace,
do
i
have
a
claim?
it
makes
it
as
unpleasant
a
work
environment
for
me
as
it
would
for
a
woman.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
she
being
discriminated
against
because
of
her
sex?
she
doesn't
like
the
denigration
of
sexuality
in
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
venick,
you've
never
had
anybody
tell
you,
you're
a
man,
what
do
you
know?
you've
never--
[laughter]
you
must
live
in
a
different
family
environment
from
mine.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
venick,
you
were
going
to
tell
us
why
the
respondent,
although
purporting
to
concede
the
psychological
injury
point,
in
fact
does
not
concede
it.
i
hope
you'll
do
that
before
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
said
sufficiently
severe
to
alter
the
conditions
of
employment.
that
is
utterly
meaningless
to
me.
i
don't
care
if
we
did
say
it.
[laughter]
sufficiently...
or
circular.
i
mean,
it's
circular.
sufficiently
severe
to
alter
the
conditions.
how
do
i
know
whether
it's
severe
enough
to
alter
the
conditions?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
those
are
all
factors,
but
how
many
of
them
do
you
need
to
alter
the
conditions?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
tell?
what
magic
event
said,
oh,
it's
risen
to
the
level
of
severity
to
alter
the
conditions?
now,
the
test
that
says,
it
affects
your
work
performance,
ah,
there's
something
i
can
identify.
but
you
just
give
me
this
standard,
it's
sufficiently
severe
to
alter
the
conditions
of
employment.
i
have
no
idea
what
that
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
identifiable.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
way
is
there
to
prove
it?
i
was
very
hopeful.
i
thought
you
had
given
us
a
touchstone...
makes
the
work
more
difficult,
it
is
severe
enough
to
affect
the
conditions
of
employment...
but
you
say
that's
not
the
only--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
else
is
there
besides
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
that.
what
does
the
plaintiff
have
to
prove?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
question
is,
sufficiently
to
what,
that's
what
the
question
is,
sufficiently
to
what?
you
give
us
one
thing,
sufficiently
to
make
the
job
more
difficult
to
perform...
fine...
and
you
say,
but
there
are
other
things,
and
you
don't
want
to
tell
us
all
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
is,
sufficiently
to
produce
psychological
injury,
okay.
you
acknowledge
that
that
is
one
way,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
if
it's
only
mildly
offensive,
so
it's
not
severe
enough...
it's
just
mildly
offensive,
but
it's
offensive.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
really
mean
more
difficult
to
do
the
job,
you
mean
more
unpleasant
to
work
there,
is
what
you
mean
by
more
difficult
to
do
the
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
don't
you
just
say
that,
more
unpleasant
to
work
there?
it
doesn't
sound
as...
it
doesn't
sound
as
good,
but
that's
really
what
you
mean.
it
makes
it
more
unpleasant
to
work
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
mean
more
difficult
to
do
the
job,
you
mean
more
unpleasant--
[laughter]
more
unpleasant
to
work
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
all
you
mean.
why
don't
you
say
that,
and
that
covers
everything
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
at
least
said
that
it
had
to
affect
work
performance,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
opponent
contends
that
that
isn't
even
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
making
a
more
unpleasant
work
environment
is
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
chernau,
why
do
you
say
that
the
test
affecting
work
performance,
which
you're
proposing,
is
the
same
test
the
eeoc
proposes?
what
do
you
base
that
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
thought...
i
was
listening
to
mr.
minear,
and
i
think
what
mr.
minear's
saying
is
it
doesn't
have
to
affect
work
performance.
it's
enough
if
it
renders
the
job
more
unpleasant,
whether
it
affects
performance
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
has
to
affect
performance.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can,
and
that
would
certainly
be
enough,
but
i'm
not...
i
don't
understand
them
to
say
that's
a
prerequisite.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
they
agree
with
that.
i
think
they
say
even
if
you
can
have
just
as
much
opportunity
for
promotion,
even
though
you
do
the
job
just
as
well,
if
you
have
to
work
in
a
more
unpleasant
environment...
substantially
more
unpleasant.
not
negligibly,
but
substantially
more
unpleasant
environment...
you
have
a
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
disagree
with
that,
right?
you
say
it
has
to
affect
work
performance.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
a
union
negotiates
a
contract
and
the
contract
says,
we
will
have
muzak
piped
in
to
the...
that's
one
of
the
conditions
of
employment.
it's
in
there,
in
the
contract.
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
affect
work
performance,
but
it
is
a
condition
of
employment.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
missed
my
point,
mr.--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't.
oh,
well,
that's
new.
that's
new
to
me,
then.
you're
changing
your
position
that
was
in
your
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
don't
have
any
disagreement
here
then.
i
think
both
sides
are
saying
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
he
apply
the
meritor
test?
