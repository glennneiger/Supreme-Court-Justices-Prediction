just
before
we
leave
this
point,
suppose
there
are
sex-based
comments
in
the
workplace
generally
among
men.
they
talk
about
sex
all
the
time.
it's
not
directed
to
the
women.
they
talk
about
male
sex,
they
talk
about
heterosexual
sex...
all
kinds
of
sex.
the
woman
is
highly
offended
by
this.
it's
not
directed
at
her.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
i
have
trouble
with
this
whole
debate.
it's
hard
for
me
to
imagine
something
that
a
reasonable
employer
could
do
that
a
reasonable
employee
could
object
to.
it
just
seems
to
me
circular.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
reasonable
employee
could
object
to
it,
a
reasonable
employer
couldn't
do
it.
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
i
have
great
difficulty
with
this
problem,
and
i
agree
with
the
suggestion
of
the
chief
justice
that
we
look
upon
the
actor
whom
we
are
attempting
to
control,
and
require
that
that
actor
be
reasonable
in
his
or
her
conduct
in
the
workplace.

well,
but
he
might
have
been
very
wrong.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
not
his
subjective
belief,
is
it?
if
an
employer
thinks
he's
being
reasonable
and
he's
coarse
and
vulgar
and
creates
a
hostile
working
environment,
he's
liable
under
the
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
unwelcome
component
of
the
test,
which
is
not
involved
here,
is
to
satisfy
some
subjective--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--requirement,
and
makes
this
not
just
like
negligence
in
the
act.
