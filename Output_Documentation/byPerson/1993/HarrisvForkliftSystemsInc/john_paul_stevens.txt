i'm
puzzled
by
the
more
difficult
to
do
the
job.
supposing
an
office
had
a
policy...
they
found
out
that
people
worked
more
efficiently
if
they
didn't
look
at
the
window,
so
they
gave
all
the
windowless
offices
to
the
women
and
the
offices
with
nice
views
to
the
men,
so
it's
more
pleasant
to
work
there,
and
they
did
this
as
a
matter
of
policy.
women
get
the
inside
offices,
men
get
the
outside
offices.
each
do
their
work
exactly
as
efficiently
as
the
other,
without
difficulty.
is
there
a
violation
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
it
being
more
difficult--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
why
should
you
win
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
magistrate
rested
that
case,
and
did
no
actual
interference
with
work
performance,
and
he
did
say
that,
but
you
say
that's
not
necessary,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
win,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
ask?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
applied
more
than
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
applied
more
than
that.
he
applied
two
elements
that
are
not
in
it,
1)
the
severe
psychological
injury,
and
secondly,
interference
with
work
performance,
neither
of
which
is
in
meritor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
other
question,
if
i
may.
the
magistrate
said,
not
abusive
to
plaintiff,
so
that
would
have
been
subjective.
do
you
think
that's
equivalent
to
saying
not
abusive
to
a
reasonable
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
paragraph
to
which
you
refer
is
devoted
to
her
subjective
reaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a-34,
running
over
to
a-35.
it
begins,
"neither
do
i
believe
the
plaintiff
was
subjectively
so
offended.
"
and
then
ends
with
"not
too
abusive
to
the
plaintiff.
"
so
the
finding
is
that
if
the
meritor
test
is
subjective,
you're
right,
he
did
make
that
finding,
but
if
the
meritor
test
is
objective,
this
paragraph
does
not
address
the
question.
