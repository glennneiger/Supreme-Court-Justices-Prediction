we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
92-1168,
teresa
harris
v.
forklift
systems,
inc.
mr.
venick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
would
be
different
if
charles
hardy
had
been
equally
scathing
and
offensive
to
men,
calling
them
dumb-ass
men?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
wouldn't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
see
why
it
should
necessarily
be
the
reasonable
woman,
reasonable
victim,
as
you
put
it,
rather
than
the
reasonable
employer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
we're
trying
to
find
out,
and
one
way
we
will
find
out
differently,
depending
on
what
test
is
applied,
is
whether
you
say,
is
it
a
reasonable
employer
or
a
reasonable
victim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
define
from
whose
focus
discrimination
is
to
be
considered.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
have
any
number
of
personal
injury
statutes...
that
are
designed
to
protect
employees,
but
the
standard
of
negligence
is
not
the
standard
of
a
reasonable
employee
but
the
standard
of
a
reasonable
person.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
venick.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
wonder
if
alter
the
environment
is
the
happiest
way
of
putting
it.
it
was
put
that
way
in
meritor,
certainly,
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
defense
for
the
employer
for
him
to
show
that
he'd
been
doing
this
for
20
years.
there's
no
alteration
of
the
environment.
he'd
always
done
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
really
doesn't
depend
on
altered
treatment
at
all,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
some
sort
of
de
minimis?
there
is
different
treatment,
but
it's
just
barely
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
chernau.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
chernau.
the
case
is
submitted.
