justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
purpose
would
not
be
invalidating
so
long...
you...
i
think
you've
said...
so
long
as
the
subsidy
were
applied
in
some
other
way,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can...
i
can
want
to
protect
or...
or
compensate
massachusetts
dairy
farmers
for
their
inefficiency
if
i
want
to,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
so,
all
that
has
to
be
done
in
this
case
is
to
provide...
provide
the
same
tax,
but
the
funds,
instead
of
going
into
this
segregated
fund,
go
into
general
revenues,
and
that'll
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
that
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
can't
tax
milk
processors
separately?
this
is
a
category
of
taxation
that
you
can't
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
pick
that
out?
you
can't
pick
that
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
not
the
proceeds
of
the
tax,
the
tax
goes
into
general
revenues.
and
then,
in
a
totally
different
bill
the
state
votes
out
of
general
revenues
money
that
could
be
given
to,
you
know,
to
elderly
and
little
children,
and
they
say,
we're
going
to
give
it
instead
to
inefficient
milk
producers;
they
make
that
decision
to
take
the
money
out
of
general
revenues.
you
say
that
is
still
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
being...
they're
not
being
taxed
from
other...
differently
from
other
people
similarly
situated.
all
milk
processors
are
taxed
the
same
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
taxes
are
imposed
that
way.
you
pick
a
class
of
people
and
you
say,
you
know,
we're
going
to
have
a...
a
lawyers
tax,
a
milk
processors...
gee,
we
tax
all
sorts
of
little
individual
groups.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
are
complaining
about
a
subsidy
then?
you're
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you...
you
acknowledge
that
taxing
milk
processors
alone
would
be
okay.
it...
however,
if
you
do
that,
you're
saying,
you
cannot
have
a
subsidy
to
massachusetts
inefficient
milk
producers?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that
if
they
both,
impose
that
tax
and
also
subsidize
massachusetts
producers,
then
it
becomes
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
only
subsidized
massachusetts
producers
in
two-thirds
of
the
amount
that
they...
that
they
garner
from
this
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
want
to
have
to
play
two-thirds,
four-fifths
and
whatnot,
which
makes
me
think,
if
it
comes
out
of
general
revenues,
it's
okay.
and
if
i
think
that
it's
okay
when
it
comes
out
of
general
revenues,
why
isn't
it
okay
when
it
comes
out
in
your
case?
why
is
your
case
so
different
from
general
revenues?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
assume
that
i'm...
i'm
stupid...
and
that's...
that's
how
i
feel
about
it.
why
is
your
case
different
from
general
revenues?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
elderly
and
children.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
it
happen
every
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you'd
pay
a
political
price
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
four-fifths
is
okay,
so
long
as
it
isn't
tied
to
the
other
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
you
acknowledge
that
they...
you
acknowledge
that
that's
perfectly
okay,
so
long
as
they
do
it
by
a
general
subsidy.
they
could
have
the
same
motive:
we
have
inefficient
producers.
we
want
to
keep
those
inefficient
producers
in
business.
we
are
going
to
carefully
calculate
how
much
money
we
have
to
give
them
to
keep
them
in
business.
they
can
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you're
just
complaining
about
the
tax,
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
massachusetts
is
not
doing
anything
worse
than
what
the
federal
government
is
doing,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
thing...
the
federal
government
just...
just
isn't
giving
enough
of
a
subsidy
to
inefficient
producers
to
carry
the
massachusetts
people.
it's
just
carrying
people
from
other
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
theory
of
the
commerce
clause
is
not
that
you
can't
subsidize
inefficiency.
it's
that
only...
or
favor
in-state
inefficiency...
that
isn't
the
theory
of
it.
the
theory
of
the
commerce
clause
is
that
only
the
federal
government
can
favor
in-state
inefficiency,
and
not
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
what
about
the
sales
tax
hypothetical
that
your...
your
colleague
put
to
us?
you
impose
a
sales
tax
on
in-state
and
out-of-state
goods,
and
rebate
the
full
amount
to
all
the
in-state
people.
that's
bad,
i
suppose.
why?
because
it's
a
rebate.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so,
we
don't
call...
no,
this
is
not
a
true
rebate.
it's
going
to
be
called
a
subsidy.
it
happens
to
be
in
the
same
amount
as
the
tax
that
you
paid;
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
when
you
say
there's
no
chance
that
they're
going
to
pass
it
along.
i
don't
under...
would
you
explain
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
use
it
to
reduce
price,
he
uses
it
to
increase
sales.
since
everybody
has
to
pay
this
tax,
and
only
he
gets
it
back,
he
can
make
more
sales.
otherwise,
he
couldn't
afford
to
sell
at
those
prices.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
but
maybe
he
shouldn't...
he
shouldn't
be
able
to
survive.
i
mean,
that's...
you
know,
that's
the
theory
of
the
free
market.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
do
admit,
mr.
wilkins,
indeed,
it's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
law
that
some
dairy...
some
dairy
farmers
in
massachusetts
stay
in
business,
who
otherwise
wouldn't
be
able
to
stay
in
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
deprives
out-of-state
farmers
of
an
opportunity
to
sell
more
milk,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
when
a
dairy
farmer
goes
out
of
business
in
massachusetts,
the
people
of
massachusetts
stop
drinking
as
much
milk?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
makes
any
difference
whether
they
can
raise
their
price
or
not
raise
their
price.
if
you're
keeping
somebody
in
business
who
otherwise
would
be
out
of
business,
and
an
in...
an
in-state
person
in
business
who
otherwise
would
be
out
of
business,
you're
affecting
the
opportunities
of
out-of-state
people
to
sell.
it
has
to
follow.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
a
different
argument.
that's
different
from
the
argument
that
there's
no
harm
done
because
these
people
can't
lower
their...
lower
their
prices
anyway.
