mr.
rosenbaum,
i'm
wondering
if...
if
all
we
have
in
the
order
was
the
requirement
that
there
be
paid
an
assessment
on
all
liquid
milk
sold
in
massachusetts,
would
that
be
a
commerce
clause
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nothing
more
than
that.
we
have
the
assessment
on
all
liquid
milk.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not...
if
all
we
had
was
not
an
assessment,
but
just
money
appropriated
by
the
state
to
give
to
massachusetts
dairy
farmers
to
help
them,
would
that
be
a
commerce
clause
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
presumably
that's
okay.
we
have
all
kinds
of
ways
of
helping
local
industries,
don't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we've
never
held
that's
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
both
of
those
acts
can
be
constitutional,
then
what
makes
it
unconstitutional
when
you
put
them
together,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
assessment
was
on
all
milk
from
any
source.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
so
happens
that
a
high
percentage
of
the
milk
is
purchased
from
out
of
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
all
we
had
before
us
was
an
assessment
on
the
sale
in
massachusetts
of
all
liquid
milk
from
any
source,
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
baldwin...
that
it
would
fall
under
the
baldwin
principle
and
be
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
on
that
point...
and
i'm
not
sure
it
determines
anything
under
the
commerce
clause...
but
i
assume
that
if
the
proposition
had
to
go
before
the
legislature
every
year,
of
whether
the
state
should
be
paying
out
so
much
cash
to
dairy
farmers,
that
might
be
tough
sledding.
but
where
it
can
be
packaged
in
a
deal,
where
the
legislature
is
told,
look,
you
only
have
to
decide
this
one
time.
if
you
let
the
agricultural
secretary
impose
this
order,
90
percent
of
the
cost
is
going
to
fall
on
out-of-staters,
and
we
can
help
our
dairy
farmers
at
no
cost
to
in-staters,
for
all
practical
purposes.
that's
an
easy
sell.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
practical
effect
here
is
that
90
percent
is
coming
from
out
of
state,
and...
and
milk
sold
from
out
of
state
is
contributing
the
bulk
of
the
money
that's
being
recycled
in-state
to
local
farmers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
i
were
a
legislator
up
there,
i
think
i'd
found
a
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what...
what
if
there
is
a
pass-through,
and
the
effect
is
to
let
the
massachusetts
dairy
farmers
sell
their
milk
more
cheaply
than
out-of-staters?
i
mean
you
might
have
a
scheme
where
the
effect
is
just
like
imposing
a
tax
on
out-of-state
milk.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
it
did,
what's
the
result?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
do
you
say
that
inquiry
isn't
required
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
there
are
local
dairy
farmers
in
massachusetts
that
can
lower
their
prices
because
of
this
subsidy?
