chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-141,
west
lynn
creamery
v.
jonathan
healy.
mr.
rosenbaum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
it
key
that
it's
this
precise
correspondence
that
you
talk
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know.
but
why
is
that
so
critical?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
in
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
you
said
it
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
it
any
concern
of
this
court
interpreting
the
commerce
clause
as
to
whether
the
milk
commissioner
in
massachusetts
or
the...
what
do
you
call
it,
the
general
court,
the
body
that
passes
laws...
makes
the
decision?
i
mean,
the
organization
of
state
government
is
purely
a
matter
of
state
law,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
ought
to
somehow
fuse
those
into
our
commerce
clause
analysis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
that
would
happen
whether
it
was
done
by
the
massachusetts
legislature
or
by
the
milk
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
in
answering
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
thought
you
said
that
simply
a
levy
on
the
processors,
without
any
ensuing
subsidy,
would
be
unobjectionable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
the
same
about
a
state
income
tax
law
which
used
the
federal
income
tax
return
as
the
form,
and
then
computed
the
state
income
tax
on
the
basis
of
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
it's
preempted
by
the
federal
system?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
what
is
your
response
to
justice
kennedy?
is
that
simply
a
neutral
factor
or...
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
perhaps
kind
of
suspect,
without
being
more
definite
than
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
that
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
does
no
more
than
perhaps
show
motive,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rosenbaum.
mr.
wilkins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
mr.
wilkins,
does
not
enact
herbert
spencer's
social
status?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wilkins.
mr.
rosenbaum,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenbaum.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
93-141,
west
lynn
creamery,
inc.
versus
healy
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
