justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
have
difficulty
putting
your
case
into
the
baldwin
framework.
because
in
baldwin,
there
was
almost
a
violation
of
the
state's
jurisdiction.
it
was
predicating
its
act
on
occurrences
that
were
outside
of
the
state.
here
the
act
is
key
simply
to
an
in-state
massachusetts
transaction.
that's
all
that's
happening.
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
fatal
to
your
case,
but
i
just
do
not
see
the
applicability
of
baldwin
here
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
but
the...
the
law
could
not
operate
unless
the
milk
commission,
or
whoever
the
state
enforcing
agency
was
in
that
case,
took
notice
of
a
price
of
a
transaction
of
an
occurrence
that
happened
outside
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
not
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
only
for
purposes
of
the...
of
the
subsidy,
not
for
the
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
that...
in
that
connection,
is
it
any
part
of
your
case...
perhaps
it
is
not...
but
is
it
any
part
of
your
case
that
the
invalidity
of
this
scheme
is
triggered
by
the
fact
that
it,
in
effect,
piggy-backs
off
a
regional
milk-pricing
scheme?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
only
does
it
upset,
but
it...
it
uses
it
as
a
formula,
as
a
base.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
seems
to
me
somewhat
suspect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
not
clear
to
me
why
you
have
the
motive
to
prefer
one
truck
over
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
you
think
that
we
could,
consistent
with
our
precedence,
write
in
this
opinion
that
any
state
that
wishes
to
impose
a
discriminatory
tax
may
do
so
by
imposing
a
neutral
tax
and
then
rebating
all
in-state
payors
their
share
of
that
tax?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
this
case
any
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
formalism
count...
would
formalism
count
for
everything
here--
