mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
main
issue
here
is
whether
this
massachusetts
law
is,
per
se,
illegal.
we
submit
that
the
way
this
law
operates
in
this
particular
market
shows
two
things,
both
of
which
rebut
that
claim.
the
first
is
that
this
order
is
nothing
more
than
a
combination
of
two
elements
that
ordinarily
are
lawful
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause;
and,
second,
we
have
not
found
a
way
to
avoid
the
political
process.
we
have
not
avoid
a
way...
found
a
way
to
avoid
accountability
and
responsibility
to
the
citizens
of
the
commonwealth.
on
that
latter
point,
it
is
significant
that
west
lynn
testified
that
it
in
fact
passes
on
50
percent
of
its
assessment
to
its
customers.
west
lynn
absorbs
50
percent
of
the...
of
the
assessment.
and
so,
there
are
two
constituencies,
both
dealers
and
either
retailers
or
consumers,
who
are
well
represented
in
massachusetts,
who
have
every
incentive,
if
they
disagree
with
this
disposition
of
money,
to
complain.
the
record
shows
that
they
accept
this
program.
and
that
is
why
we
have
this
law,
not
because
we've
found
a
way
to
insulate
ourselves
from
the
political
process.
now,
the
context
is
important.
and
we
submit
that
instead
of
bolstering
the
petitioners'
argument
here,
the
federal
context
actually
supports
our
position.
this
is
a
highly
regulated
market,
and
the
regulation
extends
to
regulation
of
price...
prices
charged
by
farmers
and
paid
by
dealers.
the
farmer,
therefore,
cannot
significantly
reduce
its
price
in
order
to
effectively
pass
through
this
subsidy
to
the
processor.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
i'm
sure
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
well,
we
believe
that
the
federal
system
allows
us
the
flexibility
to
do
this.
and,
in
fact,
there
is
no
preemption
of
our
ability
to
do
this,
as
we
argued
in
our
brief.
the
federal
government
intends
to
permit
the
states
to
enact
this
kind
of
law.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
well,
i
disagree
with
it
to
the
extent
we
are
talking
about
subsidies,
your
honor.
the
dormant
commerce
clause
permits
the
states
to
exercise
its
spending
power
through
subsidies
in
order
to
favor
its...
its
producers.
and,
in
this
case,
it's
not
a
matter
of
inefficiency
of
the
producers.
the
producers
themselves
are
efficient,
but
there
are
higher
costs.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
if
we're
talking
about
a
true
rebate.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
well,
it's
not
because
we
call
it
a
subsidy.
it's
because
we
are
not
paying
the
money
back
to
the
same
people
who
paid
it
in.
our
subsidy
is
not
a
rebate,
because
the
dealers
pay
the
assessment
and
we
subsidize
the
farmers.
and,
in
fact,
because
of
the
federal
system
and
because
of
the
facts
developed
before
the
commissioner
regarding
this
market,
that
is
a...
is
a
particularly
meaning
distinction
in
this
industry,
because
there
is
virtually
no
likelihood
that
the
farmers
will
in
fact
pass
that
money
along.
the
federal
minimum
price
prevents
them
from
doing
that,
to
a
large
extent.
and,
in
fact,
the...
the
dire
situation
of
the
farmers
which
led
to
the
enactment
of
this
law
suggests
strongly
that
these
farmers
need
to
dig
themselves
out
from
debt.
they
need
to
invest.
and,
indeed,
that
is
why
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
said
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
prevent
the
collapse
of
the
dairy
farms.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
well,
the
farmer
is
greatly
restricted
in
reducing
price.
so,
if
the
farmer
was
going
to
use
this
subsidy
to
reduce
price,
the
federal
law
restricts
that,
and
the
farmer's
own
circumstances,
given
the
need
to
pay
back
debt
and
to
invest
in
feed
and
fertilizer,
makes
that
a
virtual
impossibility.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
well,
we
believe
that
the
farmer
is
able
to
survive
because
of
this.
in
terms
of
increasing--
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
--excuse
me?
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
well,
yes,
but
the
dormant
commerce
clause
does
not
enact
free
market
principles.
it...
it
allows
free
trade,
so
that
boundaries
between
states
are...
are
irrelevant.
but
it
does
not
prevent
the
state
from
deciding,
here
is
an
industry
or
a
segment
of
an
industry
that
provides
us
many
benefits.
it
provides
us
diversity,
with
respect
to
our
agricultural
base.
it
provides
us
other
benefits...
cultural,
social,
educational,
et
cetera.
and
to
preserve
those
benefits,
the
dormant
commerce
clause
recognizes
that
the
states
may
use
their
spending
powers...
not
their
regulatory
powers...
to
preserve
those
benefits.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
i
think
that
would
be
a
good
way
to
put
it,
your
honor,
yes.
and,
indeed,
the
economic
burden
falls
upon
the
consumers
and
dealers
of
massachusetts.
so,
this
is
a
situation
where
it's
a...
a
contest
between
competing
groups
within
the
commonwealth,
all
of
whom
have
a
say
in
the
political
process
that
created
the
laws.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
well,
it
would
be
an
easy
sell,
but
only
because
we
would
have
misrepresented
what
we
are
doing.
we
are
not
passing
on
90
percent
of
the
costs
to
out-of-staters.
now,
it
is
true
that
90
percent
of
the
milk...
the
fluid
milk...
does
tend
to
come
from
out
of
state,
but
that's
not
a
particularly
unusual
situation,
where
we
are
only
one
out
of
50
states.
in
fact,
that
may
be
a
commodity
that
we
produce
proportionately
more
of
relative
to
most
commodities.
but--
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
--we
don't
view
it
that
way,
your
honor.
we
don't
view
it
as
the
milk
is
contributing...
this...
this
is
a...
a
dollar
assessment
that
falls
upon
dealers
and
consumers
within
massachusetts,
and
they're
the
ones
who
pay.
so
it's
not
that
we're...
we're
not...
we
haven't
found
a
way
to
export
our
tax
burden.
this
is
a
burden
that--
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
would
be
accurate.
and
i
think
what...
what
we
have
done
is
found
a
way
to
make
it
palatable
for
in-state
interests
to
shoulder
this
burden.
we
have...
we
have
said,
basically,
to
the
constituencies
who
are
affected
by
this
that
if
you
pay
this
money,
here
is
where
it
will
go.
we
will
not
use
it
to
build
up
a
bloated
bureaucracy,
if
you
will.
this
kind
of
fund
is
a
useful
way,
particularly
in
hard
fiscal
times,
to
tell
the
electorate
and
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
shouldering
these
burdens
that
we
are
going
to
be
spending
the
money
for
a
purpose,
and
here
is
what
the
purpose
is.
and
if
you
agree
with
us,
fine.
and
if
you
disagree
with
us,
then
you
have
a
remedy
through
the
political
process.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
because
this
is
not
a
rebate.
we
are
not
paying
money
back
to
the
in-state
people
who
have
been
assessed
with
this
assessment.
the...
the
assessment
and
the
rebate
take
place
at
two
separate
levels.
and
the
people
who
are
benefitted
by
this
law
are
not
the
same
people
who
are
burdened
by
it.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
it
doesn't
count
for
everything,
your
honor.
it
is
important.
but
there
is
a
substantive
difference,
particularly
within
this
industry,
where
there
is
even...
although
this
may
or
may
not
be
constitutionally
relevant...
there
is
even
a...
a
bar
or...
or
a
severe
limit
upon
passing
back
this
subsidy
from
the
farmer
to
the
processor.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
may
be
of
no
constitutional
significance
is
because
west
lynn,
in
its
reply
brief,
at
page
13,
note
10,
says
that
what
the
farmers
do
with
the
money
is
of
no
significance.
i...
i
think
that's
a
question
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
here,
because
we
have
an
industry
where
the
farmers
can't
reduce
their
price
below
the
federal
minimum,
where
the
farmers
are
required
to
pay
off
their
debt
and
to
invest.
and
the
record
shows
that
they
are
very
far
behind
in
those
areas.
and,
in
addition,
the
order
itself
is
crafted
with
some
limits
to
make
sure
that
this
does
not
get,
if
you
will,
out
of
hand.
it
has
a...
a
limit
upon
the
subsidy.
if
the
zone
21
blend
price
gets
to
$15,
the
assessment
and
the
subsidy
vanish.
so
there's
a
protection
at
that
level.
and,
in
addition,
there
is
a
limit
upon
the
amount
of
the
subsidy
that
can
be
granted.
it's
a
200,00
pound
limit.
and
if
the
farmer
produces
more
than
the
200,000,
the
farmer
will
get
no
subsidy
for
the
excess
amount.
so,
we
have...
it
is
a
substantive,
as
well
as
formal,
distinction
in
this
particular
case.
i
would
not
advocate
that
we
could
assess
our
in-state
processors...
i'm
sorry...
assess
all
processors
and
merely
give
the
money
back
to
in-state
processors.
i
think
that
is
a
discriminatory
tax
by
another
name
and
it
ought
to
be
treated
as
a
discriminatory
tax.
now,
the
case
has
been
argued
on...
on
the
basis
that
baldwin
applies
here,
and
that,
therefore,
the
law
is,
per
se,
invalid.
the
distinctions
between
this
case
and
baldwin
are
many,
and
they
are
fundamental.
under
this
law,
to
the
extent
allowable
by
the
federal
law,
a
out-of-state
farmer
may
increase
or
decrease
his
or
her
price.
they
may
import
as
much...
or
export
as
much
milk
as
they
wish.
there
is
simply
no
barrier
at
the
border
that
prevents
an
out-of-state
farmer
from
competing.
and,
indeed,
no
in-state
consumer
or
dealer
has
an
incentive
to
buy
massachusetts
milk
as
a
result
of
this
order,
nor
does
any
incentive
to
buy
out-of-state
milk
vanish
as
a
result
of
this
order.
and
in
this
resp...
these
respects,
this
case
is
entirely
different
from
baldwin.
baldwin
involved
an
import
ban,
which
is
not
here.
and
it
involved
a
condition
which,
as
i
think
justice
kennedy
pointed
out
earlier,
a
condition
which
injected
new
york's
laws
into
its
neighboring
states,
to
regulate
the
prices
that
were
being
charged
there.
to
the
extent
that
west
lynn
argues
that
this
is
price
regulation
and
relies
upon
the
use
of
that
word,
i
submit
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
considered
that
issue
and
said,
at
page
126
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
the
pricing
order
does
not
establish
a
minimum
price
milk
dealers
must
pay
for
milk,
regardless
of
point
of
origin.
and
to
the
extent
that
characterization
at
the
state
level
by
state
officials
is
at
all
relevant
here,
that
characterization
should
control
over
the
characterization
in
the
commissioner's
order,
which,
incidentally,
was
enacted
before
the
legislature
passed
a
statute
placing
this
funds...
these
funds
within
the
treasury.
and
once
the
legislature
did
that,
and
appropriated
these
funds
out
on
a
continuing
basis,
that
was
a
modification
of
the
order
to
that
extent,
and
certainly
removes
the
analogy
to
a
price.
the
trust
fund
methodology
that
we
have
adopted
here
is
a
fairly
standard
way
for
states,
and
even
the
federal
government,
to
structure
spending.
and
it
is
necessary
for
both
state
and
federal
government
to
have
the
kind
of
flexibility
to
structure
the
laws
in
these
ways.
the
best
analogy
that
i
can
think
of
in
this
area
is
the
court's
recent
decision,
1992,
in
new
york
v.
united
states,
particularly
part
3a
of
that
opinion,
which
was
a
unanimous
holding
of
the
court,
where
the
court
viewed...
or
analyzed
a
federal
escrow
scheme
that
was
quite
similar
to
the
structure
of
what
we
have
here.
there,
money
went
into
an
escrow
scheme
through...
through
federal
taxation.
it
was
specifically,
by
statute,
not
deemed
to
be
property
of
the
united
states.
and
yet,
when
it
was
disbursed
from
this
escrow
fund,
the
court
said
that
this
was
an
exercise
of
spending
power
by
congress,
and
said
that
the
funds
were
federal
funds.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
something
quite
similar.
we
are
saying
that
we
are
using
a...
a
trust
fund,
or
analogous
to
the
escrow
fund,
and
that
the
funds,
even
though
they
are
held
in...
in
some
kind
of
trust,
nevertheless,
are
spending,
when
they
are
disbursed,
and,
therefore,
fall
within
the
market
participation
doctrine,
and,
similarly,
the
funds
continue
to
be
states
even
though
they
are
held
in
a
trust
fund.
the
use
of
a
trust
fund
presents
no
issue
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
because
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
concerned
with
free
trade,
not
with
how
the
states
structure
the
powers
within
their
internal
governmental
organs.
and
the
highland
dairy
case
is...
is
pertinent
here,
because
it
said
that
how
power
is
distributed
by
a
state
among
its
governmental
organs
is
commonly,
if
not
always,
a
question
for
the
state
itself.
by
insisting
that
a
subsidy
come
out
of
the
general
fund,
west
lynn
is
asking
the
court
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
particular
state
mechanisms,
such
as
annual
appropriations
versus
general
laws
versus
delegation
of
power
to
an
executive
agency.
it's
asking
the
court
to
analyze
the
purposes
for
which
revenues
are
raised
and
spent.
and,
indeed,
i
think
counsel's
response
to
justice
scalia's
questions
in
this
regard
suggest
just
how
deep
that
inquiry
goes.
apparently,
west
lynn
would
argue
that
even
if
money
is
paid
into
the
general
fund,
the
court
can
still
link
that
money
with
a
subsequent
subsidy
and
declare
it
invalid.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
perhaps
that's
their
argument.
i
thought
their
reply
brief
was...
was
broader
than
that.
but
even
if
the
question
is
the
matter
of
linkage,
we
think
that
the
matter
of
linkage
is,
again,
a
matter
that
does
not
involve
questions
of
free
trade
among
the
states.
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
how
the
state
structures
its
own
internal
mechanisms
for...
for
assessing
money
and
spending
it.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
if
the
people
who
receive
the
funds
are
at
the
same
level
of
competition,
if
they're
all...
if
they're
in
competition
with
each
other,
i
think
that
would
be
unlawful.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
if
they
are
not
in
competition,
if
they're
at
a
different
level
of
the
industry,
particularly
here,
where
there
are
many
reasons
why
there
is...
not
even
a
reason...
no
basis
for
reaching
a
pass-through
question,
then
there
is
in
fact
no
protectionism,
because
competitors
are
not
being
treated
unalike,
except...
except--
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
--well,
ultimately,
a
subsidy
could
have
that
effect.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the--
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
--well,
this...
this
gets
into,
i
think,
what
is
a
very
knotty
area.
the
result,
i
think,
is
that
the
plaintiff
in
such
a
case
would
have
to
make
a
factual
showing
that
in
fact
there
was
such
a
market
dislocation
that
the
political
process
no
longer
was
effective.
that
is,
professor
regan's
suggestion.
and
it
is
a
knotty
question
either
way.
once
you
allow
a
subsidy,
do
you
get
into
that
kind
of...
of
question?
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
well,
because
we
never
get
to
the
point
of
the
pass-through,
given
the
federal
minimum
price,
given
the
farmers'
need
to
dig
themselves
out
from...
from
debt
and
to
invest.
and--
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
--certainly,
they
can't
do
it
significantly
because
of
the
federal
minimum
price.
if
there's
going
to
be
price
reduction,
it
would...
it
would
be
of
a
very
minor
nature.
and...
and
the
third
reason
why
i
think
this
issue
is
not
here
is
because
this...
that's
not
the
theory
upon
which
west
lynn
has
proceeded.
and
so,
there
is
no
factual
record,
there
are
no
findings,
that
would
allow
us
to
get
into
that.
but
i...
i
think
that
professor
regan
is
quite
correct
in
urging
caution
in
this
particular
area.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
given
the--
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
--well,
no.
there's
a
surplus
of
milk.
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
no.
but
there
is
a
surplus
of
milk.
so,
it
may
simply
mean
that
out-of-state
dairy
farmers
sell
more
of
their
milk
in
the
high-paying
categories.
it's
a
very
complex
system.
but
if
somebody
in
massachusetts
goes
out
of
business,
then
the
out-of-state
dealer
may
be--
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
--well,
we're...
to
the
extent
we
keep
people
in
business,
we're
only
affecting
opportunities
by
reason
of
paying
a
subsidy,
by
reason
of
our
spending
program,
which
is...
is
therefore
not
a--
mr.
douglas
h.
wilkins
--that
is
a
different
argument,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
question
about
what
would
happen
if
we
had
a
different
factual
situation,
where
they
could
lower
their
prices,
would...
the
answer,
either
way,
i
think,
is
difficult
for
this
court.
and
i
think
that's
why
professor
regan
urges
caution
in
this
area.
and...
and
i
certainly
agree
with
that;
that
there's
no
reason
to
reach
that
kind
of
issue
in
this
case.
now,
west
lynn
has
also
arguing
in
its
brief
that
out-of-state
farmers
are
going
to
receive
less
from
dealers.
that
is,
that
voluntary
premiums,
to
the
extent
they
exist,
are
not
going
to
be
paid.
this
argument
is
rebutted
by
the
testimony
of
west
lynn's
own
president.
at
page
59
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
is
talking
about
how
he
is
going
to
provide
for
the
assessment.
and
he
says,
we're
putting
in
escrow
100
percent
of
the
money.
so,
50
percent
of
the
money
is
money
we've
received
from
customers.
the
other
50
percent
is
money
we're
receiving
that
we're
putting
in
right
out
of
our
own
profits.
so,
he's
passing
on
50
percent
and
he's
taking
50
percent
out
of
his
profits.
there's
nothing
left
for
him
to
argue
that
he's
paying
less
to
out-of-state
farmers.
and,
in
fact,
west
lynn
did
not
make
such
a
direct
argument
below.
it
based
its
argument
upon
an
assumption
of
increased
production
in
massachusetts,
which
was
speculative,
given
the
limited
duration
of
this
order,
given
the
cap
and,
also,
the
time
and
investment
it
would
take
to...
to
increase
a
herd.
and,
in
addition,
we
believe
this
argument
was
waived
in
supreme
judicial
court
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
brief
at
38,
note
35.
in
short,
this
statute
is
not
a
tariff,
because
a
tariff
is
something
that
always
affects
the
cost
to
the
buyers.
it
always
creates
a
preference
for
in-state
goods
over
out-of-state
goods.
this
law
does
not
have
that
effect,
nor
does
it
have
the
other
effect
of
a
tariff,
which
is
to
raise
revenue.
this...
this
law
is...
to
the
extent
that
we
have
a
fund
that's
limited
to
a
particular
purpose,
is
actually,
to
that
extent,
a
harder
sell
in
the
political
process,
because
with
a
tariff,
the
proponents
of
the
tariff
can
say,
well,
we
have
to
raise
money
anyway,
let's
raise
it
in
a
way
that
gives
us
ourselves
an
advantage.
that
can't
be
said
about
this
law.
this
law
does
not
defray
general
costs.
and
so,
to
that
extent,
is
less
attractive
than
a
tariff.
in
sum,
west
lynn
wants
this
court
to
adopt
a
new,
per
se,
rule
of
illegality,
even
though
the
record
shows
that
our
law
is
not
a
protectionist
regulation.
there's
no
question
that
massachusetts
dairy
farms
are
in
crisis.
our
response
to
that
crisis
does
not
unlawfully
affect
interstate
commerce
any
more
than
an
ordinary
subsidy
and
an
evenhanded
tax.
our
program
should
not
be
struck
down
upon
the
new,
per
se,
rule
that
runs
counter
to
the
record
and
counter
to
the
findings
below.
we
submit
that
the
dormant
commerce
clause
does
not
hamper
the
states
in
fashioning
programs
like
the
one
we
have
adopted.
thank
you.
