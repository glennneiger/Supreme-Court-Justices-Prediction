mr.
rosenbaum,
isn't
there
another...
and
maybe
i'm
just
missing
something
here...
but
it
isn't
merely
whether
it's
out
of
general
revenues
or
not,
but,
rather,
whether
the
computation
of
the
amount
of
the
subsidy
is
dependent
upon
the
amount
collected
from
all
the
dealers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
key,
isn't
it,
rather
than...
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
fund
through
general
revenue
or
have
two
separate
bills.
but
if
it's
so
separate
that
the
one
can
go
up
and
the
other
remain
constant,
then
you'd
have
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
didn't
understand
it
to
be
that.
i
thought
they
were
arguing
that
if
the
state
itself
linked
the
two,
by
saying
the
amount
of
the
subsidy
would
be
geared
to
the
amount
of
the
tax;
that
then
it
could
be
challenged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
hate
to...
maybe
you've
answered
this,
but
you're
saying
that
if
they
have
a
trust
fund
which
is
supported
entirely
by
revenues
from
members
of
an
industry,
both
in-state
and
out
of
state,
and
then
the
proceeds
of
the
trust
fund
are
distributed
entirely
to
the
in-state
members
of
the
industry,
that
that's
strictly
a
matter
of
state
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice

the
massachusetts'
pricing
order
imposes
an
assessment
on
all
fluid
milk
sold
by
dealers
to
massachusetts'
retailers.
about
two
third
of
that
milk
is
produced
out
of
state.
the
entire
assessment,
however,
is
distributed
to
massachusetts'
dairy
farmers.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
pricing
order
unconstitutionally
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
two
milk
dealers
who
import
milk
from
neighboring
states
and
distribute
it
to
massachusetts'
retailers.
after
paying
the
assessment
for
two
months,
they
refuse
to
make
further
payments.
when
respondent,
the
commissioner
of
the
massachusetts
department
of
food
and
agriculture,
initiated
proceedings
to
revoke
their
licenses.
petitioners
filed
an
action
in
state
court
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
pricing
order
on
the
ground
that
it
has
violated
the
commerce
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
upheld
the
order
reasoning
that
although
it
had
an
adverse
impact
on
interstate
commerce,
the
local
benefits
provided
to
the
commonwealth
dairy
industry
outweigh
any
such
incidental
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
we
reverse.
the
pricing
order
does
violate
the
commerce
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
because
it
discriminates
against
out
of
state
producers.
assessments
under
the
pricing
order
are
effectively
a
tax
which
makes
milk
produced
out
of
state
more
expensive.
although
the
tax
also
applies
to
milk
produced
in
massachusetts,
its
effect
on
massachusetts'
producers
is
more
than
offset
by
the
subsidy
provided
exclusively
to
the
local
dairy
farmers.
respondent's
argument
that
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce
is
outweighed
by
the
local
benefits
of
preserving
the
massachusetts'
dairy
industry
would
make
a
virtue
of
the
vice
that
the
rule
against
interstate
discrimination
condemns.
preservation
of
local
industry
by
protecting
it
from
the
rigorous
of
interstate
competition
is
the
hallmark
of
the
economic
protectionism
that
the
commerce
clause
forbids.

scalia,
joined
by
justice

has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
the
chief
justice
has

dissenting
opinion
in
which
