suppose
you
just
did
it
in
a
separate
time
period,
two
different
acts.
one
is
just
the
tax
on
all
dealers
who
sell
fresh
milk,
and
then,
another
one
is,
out
of
general
revenues,
there's
going
to
be
a
subsidy
for
massachusetts
dairy
farmers,
two
discrete
acts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
position
was
that
that...
that
you
were,
at
least
not...
that
your
argument
here
was
not
dependent
upon
that
being
unconstitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
could
you
distinguish
that
from
what
we
have
before
us?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
why
isn't
it,
as
one
of
the
briefs
said,
that's
just
a
matter
of
form?
