mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
pricing
order
issued
by
the
massachusetts
commissioner
of
agriculture.
we
submit
that
this
order
violates
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
because
it
restrains
competition
between
in-state
and
out-of-state
dairy
farmers,
blatantly
discriminates
against
out-of-state
dairy
farmers,
and
prevents
milk
processors
from
taking
advantage
of
cheaper
out-of-state
milk.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
if
the
assessment
were
to
go
into
the
general
revenues
of
the
state,
your
honor,
is
that
the
assumption
i'm
to
be
making?
if
that--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--if
the
assessment
goes
to
the
state
and
not
to
the
farmers,
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
because
that
would
simply
be
a
tax.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
this
court
said
in
the
new
energy
case
that
ordinarily
a
subsidy
will
not
be
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
has
never
yet
actually
addressed
a
case
that
had
such
facts,
and
actually
opined
with
specificity
that
such
a
regime
is
constitutional.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
yes,
pre--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--presumably
money
appropriated
from
the
general
revenues
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
going
to
massachusetts
dairy
farmers
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
well,
this
court
held
in
new
energy
explicitly
that
merely
because
a
state
could
achieve
its
goals
through
a
subsidy
did
not
mean
other
methods
of
achieving
that
goal
would
be
constitutional.
and
that
is
the
situation
here.
here,
we,
the
processors,
the
buyers,
are
being
required
to
pay
additional
sums
to
the
in-state
farmers.
there
is
no
subsidization
going
on.
this
is
a
pricing
order,
as
the
title
of
the...
of
the
document
makes
clear.
subsidies,
of
course,
are
different.
those
come
from
the
general
revenues,
as
a
whole.
they
are
subject
to
the
political
processes
of
the
requirement
that
dairy
farmers
fight
it
out
with
firemen
or
policemen
or
anyone
else
who
wants
those
funds.
and
they're
unlikely
to
be
a
substantial
problem
for
that
reason.
this,
though,
is
a
very
different
system.
this
is
a
system
that
was
put
in
place
by
the
commissioner
explicitly
because
he
believed
that
massachusetts
dairy
farmers
were,
quote,
being
overrun,
end
quote,
by
out-of-state
dairy
farmers,
because
those
dairy
farmers
had,
as
he
said,
huge
herds,
vast
acreage,
and
ready
availability
of
supply
and
labor.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
the...
the
only
way--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--i
believe
the
only
method
by
which
that
should
be
permitted
is
if
it's
a
direct
subsidy
from
the
general
revenues
of
the
state.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
my
point.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
i'm
assuming,
in
this--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--well,
because
i'm
assuming...
because,
in
that
hypothetical,
if
the
money
were
still
being
raised
through
the
assessment
on
milk
processors,
running
it
through
the
general
revenues
would
not
make
a
difference.
i'm
assuming...
i
was
assuming,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
there
is
no
specific
or
special
assessment
or
tax
being
placed
on
my
clients
that
is
funding
this
process.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
because
the
effect
would
be
the
same.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
milk
processors
or
of
course
subject
to
the
same
taxes
as
anyone
else,
but
if
the--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--you...
you
could
not
single
out
milk
processors
for
a
special
tax
and
simultaneously
provide
the
proceeds
of
that
tax
to
the
dairy
farmers.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
if
the
processors
are
being
subjected
to
a
tax
different
from
other
people
similarly
situated,
i
think
that
is
still
bad,
because,
in
essence,
you're
still
providing
the
same
sum
of
money
that
you
would
be
providing
under
this
scheme.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
well--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--but
the
impact
of
such
a
regime
would
be
the
same
as
the
pricing
order...
and
let
me
turn--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--i--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--you
can
tax
milk
processors
as
you
would
tax
any
other
businessman
involved
in
business
in
massachusetts.
but
if
you
were
to
place
a
special
tax
on
milk
processors
and
simultaneously
provide
special
funds
to
the
milk
farmers
of
massachusetts,
one
would
have
achieved
the
same
goals
as
the
pricing
order.
and
that,
we
submit,
would
be
unconstitutional.
that...
that
is
the
not
the
facts
before
this
case.
in
this
case,
the--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--well,
i
think--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--my...
my
argument
is
certainly
not
dependent
upon
that
being
unconstitutional.
those
are--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--well--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--well,
i
do
believe
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
that
result
here,
because,
of
course,
those
are
not
the
facts
before
this
court.
what
is
before
this
court
is
a
situation
in
which
the
state
of
massachusetts
feels
its
dairy
farmers
are
not
capable
of
achieving
sufficient
price
based
on
market
prices.
they
want
to
increase
that
price.
and
they
have
required
my
clients
to
pay
more
money
on
the
milk
they
receive
from
massachusetts
farmers.
if
they
only
went
that
far,
they
would
be
acting
constitutionally
under
the
nebbia
rule.
but
the
concern
of
massachusetts
is
that
my
clients
and
other
processors
would
then
turn
to
the
milk
of
out-of-state
farmers,
which
would
be
cheaper
if
it
were
not
subject
to
that
same
premium
price.
what
they
have
done
here
is
said,
we
will
require
the
same
premium,
the
same
extra
price,
to
be
paid
on
out-of-state
milk,
as
well,
to
prevent
out-of-state
farmers
from
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
their
prices
are
lower
than
the
prices
required
by
the
pricing
order
to
be
paid
to
massachusetts
farmers.
the
state
has
gone
one
step
further
than
that,
and
said
that
although
this
premium
price
must
be
paid
on
out-of-state
milk,
the
recipients
of
that
out-of-state
milk
will
not
be...
of
that
price...
will
not
be
the
out-of-state
farmer.
instead,
we
will
take
that
money
and
transfer
it
to
the
in-state
farmer,
as
well.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
the
assessment
is
on
milk
of
any
source.
but
any
source,
obviously,
encompasses
both
in-state
and
out-of-state
milk.
in
that
sense,
this
is
comparable
to
the
situation
in
the
baldwin
case,
where
the
minimum
price
that
was
established
applied
to
all
milk.
it--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--if
the
assessment...
no,
your
honor.
you
have
to
look
at
who
gets
the
money.
if...
if
the
assessment
were
just
to
go
to
support
road
building
or
the
general
needs
of
the
state,
there
would
not
be
a
displacement
of
interstate
competition
because
the
in-state
farmer
and
out-of-state
farmer,
despite
the
assessment,
are
still
receiving
the
pre-assessment
amounts
of
money.
so,
if
the
out-of-state
farmer
has
a
cost
advantage
over
the
in-state
farmer,
which
was
the
finding
that
the
massachusetts
commissioner
reached,
he
will
still
have
that
price
advantage
afterwards.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
that
would,
of
course,
be
a
different
case.
it
seems
to...
and
i
think,
as
i
said
before,
this
court
has
not
yet
had
before
it
a
case
involving
a
challenge
to
a
subsidy
coming
from
general
revenues.
and
how
close
one
has
to
get
to
that
situation
for
it
to
be
unconstitutional
is
not
now
before
the
court.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
i
think
a
bright
line--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
point
to
draw
the
line
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
well,
there
is
a
difference
between
general
revenues
and
this
scheme.
this
scheme
is
imposed
by
the
massachusetts
commissioner
of
agriculture.
through
a
one-time
action,
he
can
require
this
price
to
be
paid
forever.
monies
coming
from
general
revenues
are
subject
to
political
constraints
of
the
need
that
this
money
be
reviewed
on
a
repeated
basis
for
a
determination
of
whether
it's
better
for
these
monies
to
go
to
support
massachusetts
farmers
or--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--or
the
elderly.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
and
that
would
happen
on
a
regularized
basis.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
you
would
pay
a
political
price
for
it.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
yes.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
i
think
you
would
have
a
different
case
there.
and
at
that
point
you
would
want
to
address
the...
the
comparability
of
what...
what
was
happening.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
i'm
not
certain,
your
honor,
that
any
percentage
is
okay.
that's
not
to
say
a
state
could
not
achieve
this
goal
simp...
they
could
have
a
tax
on
all
commercial
operations
in
the
state
and
raise
money
in
that
fashion,
and
support
their
dairy
farmers
if
they
so
chose.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
there
is
precise
corres--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
critical.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
what
i
was
suggesting
was
that
if
there
were
so
little
correlation
between
the
two
that
they
could
be
viewed
as
wholly
separate,
then
perhaps
at
that
point
this
court
would
find
it
to
be
acceptable.
but,
as
a
general
rule,
certainly
here,
where
you
do
have
direct
correlation
between
the
two,
this
is
an
unconstitutional
scheme.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
certainly
a
key
to
our
argument.
and
how
far
this
court
would
choose
to
go
if
there
were
repeated--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--it
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
your
honor.
but
there
are
practical
limitations
that
will
result
from
it
coming
from
general
revenues.
i
think--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
state...
recognized
explicitly
in
the
new
energy
case...
that
a
state
could
achieve,
at
times,
the
same
goals
of
protecting
its
in-state
citizens
through
a
subsidy
that
it
might
also
be
able
to
achieve
through
an
unconstitutional
restraint
on
interstate
commerce.
but
this
court
held
that
that
fact
did
not
lead
to
what
would
otherwise
be
an
unconstitutional
constraint
being
deemed
constitutional.
well,
i...
i
agree
with
your
reading
of
that
case.
but
i
don't
think
the
new
energy
opinion
suggests
that
it
would
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
the
levy
or
the
dispensation
was
made
directly
by
the
legislature
or
by
the
milk
commissioner
being
authorized
by
the
legislature.
the
difference
is
that
under
this
scheme,
what
is
happening
is
massachusetts
dairy
farmers
who
are
inefficient
and
not
able
to
compete
are
being
given
a
preferential
status,
as
compared
to
out-of-state
dairy
farmers
who
have
lower
costs
and
competitive
advantages.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
well,
if...
if
we
are
talking
about
monies
coming
from
the
general
revenues
of
the
state,
then
there
in
fact
is
no
regulation
being
placed
upon
the
transaction
between
processors
and
out-of-state
farmers.
in
this
case,
processors
are
being
told,
if
you
are
buying
out-of-state
milk,
you
must
pay
a
premium
for
that.
if
the
money
were
coming
from
the
general
revenues,
there
is
no
such
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
going
on.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
that
transaction...
the
price
of
that
transaction
is
wholly
unaffected.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
if
the
levy
were
what
i
would
think
of
as
being
a
pure
tax,
a
dollar
tax,
going
to
the
general
revenues,
there
would
not
be
any
unconstitutionality
there.
that
is
nothing
different
than
any
other
tax.
the
reason
is
that
a
one
doll...
if
the
price
today
is
$12
to
in-state
and
out-of-state
farmers,
and
a
$1
tax
were
imposed,
the
price
being
received
by
in-state
and
out-of-state
farmers
is
still
$12.
their
relative
competitive
situation
remains
unaffected.
processors
desire
to
buy
from
in-state
and
out-of-state
farmers
remains
unaffected.
but
that
is
wholly
upset
by
this
scheme.
in
this
scheme,
in-state
farmers
are
receiving
a
premium
price.
we,
the
processors,
would
like
to
respond
to
that
scheme
by
buying
more
milk
out
of
state,
as
was
the
situation
in
baldwin.
we
are
prevented
from
doing
so
as
a
practical
matter
of
economics,
however,
because
the
premium
that
we
are
having
to
pay
on
in-state
milk
we're
also
having
to
pay
on
out-of-state
milk.
and
so,
we
cannot
take
advantage
of
the
cheaper
out-of-state
milk.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
baldwin
was
limited
to
sales
taking
place
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
baldwin
law
is
identical
in--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--yes,
but--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--well,
i
think
it
is
this
case.
the
massachusetts
commissioner
must
note
not
only
the
sales
that
have
taken
place
in
massachusetts,
which
triggers
the
law,
just
as
it
triggered
the
law
in
baldwin,
but
must
also
determine
how
much
of
that
milk
came
from
in-state
and
out
of
state,
and
then
compute
how
much
money
goes
to
in-state
farmers
as
a
result.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
well,
if
all
the
milk
in
the
baldwin
situation
had
come
from
new
york,
there
would
be
no
triggering
of
that
statute,
either.
that's
the
same
situation
as
we
have
here.
but
of
course
in
both
cases,
there
were,
and
are,
substantial
amounts
of
milk
coming
in
from
out
of
state.
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
here
the
implications
of
this
regime.
although
we're
dealing
with
milk
and
perhaps
a
somewhat
complex
federal
milk
order
system,
this
regime
could
apply
to
any
product
whatsoever.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
milk.
any
state
that
determined
that
its
in-state
manufacturers
were
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
to
the
manufacturers
of
out-of-state
people,
could
simply
say,
well,
what's
the
difference
in
their
costs?
is
it
25
cents?
fine.
we
will
place
a
25-cent
assessment
on
the
sales
in
our
state
coming
from
both
in-state
manufacturers
and
out-of-state
manufacturers.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
well,
we
do
think,
your
honor,
that
it's
clear
that
the
purpose,
of
course,
of
the
federal
order
system
is
to
establish
a
minimum
price
to
be
paid
to
farmers
in
that
region.
and
this
scheme
certainly
upsets
that
regime.
but
we--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--yes--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--yes,
your
honor.
it
takes
what
the
federal
government
has
determined
should
be
an
appropriate
minimum
price
in
the
area
and,
instead,
establishes
a
higher
minimum
price
with
respect
to
the
farmers
of
massachusetts.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
but
in
the
hypothetical
you're--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--well,
i
don't
think
this...
because
this
is
a
system
devised
to
upset
the
competitive
relationship
between
farmers
in
massachusetts
and
in
other
states--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--no,
your
honor.
we
have
not
asserted
a
preemption
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
i
think
that's
probably
a
fair
way
to
put
it.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
well,
what
it
means
is
that
it
makes
clear...
makes
perfectly
clear
what
the
state
of
massachusetts
is
up
to...
namely,
they
are
not
happy
with
the
minimum
price
that
their
farmers
receive
under
the
federal
government
system.
they
want
to...
and
what
they
are
doing
is
piggy-backing
on
that
system
so
that
out-of-state
farmers,
who
will
continue
to
be
subject
to
the
federal
order
system,
will
always
be
receiving
a
price
subject
to
the
federal
regime--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--well,
it
shows
motive,
plus
it
ensures
the
effect.
i
think
that's
the
point...
namely,
the
out-of-state
farmers
will
always
be
receiving
a...
a
price
that's
lower
than
the
price
that
the
massachusetts
farmers
are
receiving,
because
the
amounts
received
by
the
out-of-state
farmers
are
dictated
by
the
lower
federal
minimum
price.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
well,
a
state
could
come
up
with
the
same--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--yes,
that...
that's--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
that
is
the
basis...
that...
although
we
are
not
asserting
that
this
is
unconstitutional
under
preemption,
we
are
asserting
that
the
potency
of
the
system
is
established
by
the
fact
that
out-of-state
farmers
will
always
be
subject
to
a
lower
price
and
massachusetts
farmers
will
always
be
receiving
a
higher
price,
because
it
is
the...
they
always
track
in
unison.
that's
how
the
massachusetts
price
is
established.
indeed,
in
many
respects,
this
is
no
different
from
a
scheme
in
which
a
state
were
to
put
a
$1
tax
on
both
in-state
and
out-of-state
goods,
and
then
rebate
the
tax
paid
on
in-state
goods.
in
fact,
this
system
is
worse
than
that,
in
that
it
not
only
gives
the
money
raised
on
in-state
milk
to
in-state
farmers,
but
it
takes
the
money
from
out-of-state
farmers
and
transfers
that
money,
as
well.
the
practical
effect
is
that,
on
any
given
day,
an
out-of-state
farmer's
milk
truck
who
pulls
up
at
my
client's
place
of
business
will
receive,
for
example,
$12
for
his
milk,
while
an
in-state
farmer,
pulling
up
to
my
client's
plant
with
the
same
amount
of
milk,
which
goes
to
the
same
use
and
goes
to
the
same
buyer,
will
receive
$15
for
that
milk.
that
is
an
openly
blatant
discrimination.
and
it
is
funded
from
my
clients,
not
from
the
general
revenues
of
the
state.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
your
honor,
we
would...
what...
what
we
are
losing
here
is
two
things.
first,
as
in
baldwin,
if
the
higher
price
only
applied
to
in-state
milk,
which
is
constitutional
under
nebbia,
we
would
prefer
the
out-of-state
milk,
because
that
out-of-state
milk
would
not
be
subject
to
the
lower
prices...
to
the
higher
prices
and,
therefore,
it
would
be
cheaper.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
pricing
order
only
applied
to
massachusetts-produced
milk,
then
the
higher
price
would
only
be
applicable
to
that
milk,
and
we
would
buy
more
out-of-state
milk.
but,
beyond
that,
according
to
the
commissioner,
under
the
current
situation,
in-state
farmers
are
losing
sales
to
out-of-state
farmers
because
out-of-state
farmers
have
cheaper
costs
and,
therefore,
can
make
a
go
of
it
at
the
current
market
prices,
while
in-state
farmers
cannot.
their
ability
to
displace...
the
out-of-state
farmers'
ability
to
displace
the
less
efficient
in-state
farmers
is
lost,
because
the
in-state
farmers
are
receiving
the
extra
money
to
prop
up
their
inefficient
operations.
indeed,
the
amount
of
the
subsidy
is
explicitly
tied
to
the
commissioner's
determination
as
to
how
much
massachusetts
farmers
needed
to
cover
their
cost
of
operation,
explicitly
recognizing
that
the
market
price
was
lower
than
that
because
out-of-state
farmers
had
lower
costs
and
could
sell
milk
at
the
lower
market
price.
so,
that
competition
has
been
wholly
displaced.
that
is
to
say,
as
this
court
held
in
baldwin,
one
of
the
key
incidents
of
competition,
interstate,
is
that
citizens
of
one
state,
who
have
lower
cost,
are
entitled
to
displace
sales
by
citizens
of
another
state
who
have
higher
costs,
because
they
can
sell
at
a
lower
price.
massachusetts
is
explicitly
attempting
to
block
that
from
occurring.
they
couldn't
be
clearer.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
it...
it
is
a--
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
--no,
i
believe
it's
more
than
that,
your
honor.
from
money
coming
from
the
general
subsidies,
as
described
by
this
court
in
new
energy,
is
a
very
limited
exception
to
the
commerce
clause
rules
that
prevent
interference
with
interstate
competition.
the
state
has
not
acted
in
that
fashion
here.
we
believe
there
are
constraints
that
make
it
unrealistic
that
they
ever
would
be
able
to
act
in
that
fashion.
and
for
that
reason
this
is
a
very
different
situation.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
steven
j.
rosenbaum
this
court
concluded
in
the
baldwin
case
that
a
state
could
not
place
itself
in
a
position
of
economic
isolation,
quoting
from
page
527.
that
is
precisely
what
massachusetts
is
seeking
to
do.
today,
massachusetts
farmers
are
less
efficient.
they
cannot
sell
at
the
market
price.
and
they
are
losing
sales
as
a
result.
the
pricing
order
has
come
into
effect.
it
requires
we,
the
processors,
to
pay
more
money
to
the
massachusetts
farmers
in
order
that
they
have
enough
money
in
their
pockets
to
meet
their
costs.
the
necessary
result
is
that
out-of-state
farmers
cannot
displace
in-state
farmers
as
the
interstate
commerce
clause
guarantees.
justice
scalia
is
precisely
right,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
effect
of
this
is
to
preserve
sales
that
would
otherwise
be
lost,
or
increase
sales.
in
either
effect,
the
purposes
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause
are
being
thwarted
because
interstate
competition
is
being
thwarted.
the
technique
being
used
here
is
somewhat
different
than
in
baldwin,
but
the
effect
is
the
same.
in
baldwin,
the
state
required
a
higher
price
for
its
farmers
in
order
to
keep
cheaper
milk
from
coming
in
from
out
of
state.
they
also
required
that
higher
price
to
be
paid
to
out-of-state
farmers.
that
was
deemed
unconstitutional.
here,
the
state
is
requiring
a
higher
price
to
be
paid
to
massachusetts
farmers.
and
in
order
to
prevent
us
from
buying
cheaper
milk,
not
subject
to
that
requirement,
from
out-of-state
farmers,
we
are
required
to
pay
the
same
premium...
that
is
to
say,
the
same
difference
between
the
market
price
and
the
state-mandated
price
on
that
out-of-state
milk.
the
difference
is
we
are
being
required
to
pay
that
money
over
to
the
in-state
farmers.
to
the
extent
that
that
is
a
difference
with
baldwin,
it's
a
difference
that
makes
the
system
worse,
because
in-state...
out-of-state
farmers
receive
no
benefit
whatsoever
from
this
scheme.
this
is
not
a
subsidy.
we
are
required
to
pay
this
money
the
25th
of
every
month.
on
the
5th
of
the
next
month,
10
days
later,
that
money
goes
out
to
the
out...
to
the
in-state
farmers.
no
money
is
going
to
the
general
revenues.
no
money
is
coming
out
of
the
general
revenues.
it
is
a
price
regime
that
is
simply
increasing
how
much
we
are
paying,
and
that
is
precisely
the
description
of
the
regime
that
the
state
sets
forth
in
the
pricing
order
itself.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
what
kind
of
subsidy
would
or
would
not
be
appropriate,
we
submit
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
today,
as
it
was
not
before
the
court
in
new
energy,
because
we
do
not
have
a
situation
here
where
monies
are
coming
from
the
general
revenues
of
the
state
and
going
to
support
an
in-state
industry.
we
do
think
that
if
there
were
a
tightly
focused
tax
on
a
specific
industry
and
a
tightly
focused
subsidy
that
reflected
that
tax
that
then
went
to
someone
involved
in
that
same
industry,
that
would
also
be
unconstitutional,
because
that
would
have
the
same
defects
of
the
pricing
order.
but
that
is
not
before
the
court
today.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
will
complete
my
argument.
