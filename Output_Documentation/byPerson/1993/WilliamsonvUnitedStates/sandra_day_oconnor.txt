justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
petitioner,
williamson,
was
convicted
of
various
drug
crimes.
one
piece
of
evidence
against
him
was
the
confession
of
a
confederate,
reginald
harris.
in
that
confession,
harris
admitted
to
transporting
cocaine
but
also
said
other
things
that
implicated
williamson.
because
the
confession
was
made
out
of
court,
it
was
hearsay
but
the
district
court
admitted
it
as
a
statement
against
penal
interest
in
the
proceeding
against
williamson,
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
evidence
804(b)(3).
rule
804(b)(3)
allows
hearsay
statements
to
be
admitted
if
they
so
far
tend
to
expose
the
person
making
those
statements
to
criminal
liability
that
a
reasonable
person
would
not
make
them
unless
they
were
true.
williamson
appealed
his
conviction
claiming
that
harris'
statement
was
not
actually
against
harris'
penal
interest
because
it
tried
to
shift
blame
and
curry
favor
with
the
police.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
argument.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case.
we
hold
that
rule
804(b)(3)
allows
only
the
admission
of
those
individual
statements
in
a
confession
that
are
actually
against
the
declarants'
penal
interest.
it
does
not
allow
the
admission
of
the
entire
confession
just
because
some
parts
of
it
are
against
the
declarant's
interest
or
because
the
confession,
seen
as
a
whole,
is
against
the
declarant's
interest.
because
at
least
some
of
what
harris
said
really
did
not
implicate
harris
himself,
but
only
implicated
williamson,
we
conclude
that
those
statements
should
not
have
been
admitted.
we
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
apply
these
principles
in
the
first
instance.

opinion

souter;
justice
kennedy

filed
an
opinion
concurring

the
judgment
