unknown
speaker
the
declarant
is
what
you're--
unknown
speaker
--you
pronounced
it
declarant.
unknown
speaker
well,
just
so
i
understand
what
you're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
but
the
declarant
did
admit
his
own
criminal
liability,
at
least
to
something
in
this
area.
unknown
speaker
he
was
found
in
position,
and
he
knew
what
it
was,
and
he
was
transporting
it,
so
that
would
be
enough
to
convict
the
declarant
of
several
offenses,
i--
unknown
speaker
--were
there
conspiracy
charges
brought
against
the
two
defendants?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
this
entire
class
of
statements
can't
be
admitted,
mr.
waxman?
the
government
seems
to
argue
that
it
is
a
case-by-case
analysis
under
our
decision
in
lee
and
cases
like
that.
are
you
saying
that
there
is
a
broad
exclusionary
principle,
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
put
so
many
qualifications
on
it,
though,
that
it's
hard
to
know
how
general
your
principle
is.
all
of
this
is
technically
hearsay,
i
take
it.
these
are
people
who
don't
testify
at
trial,
and
you're
trying
to
get
it
in
as
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule,
and
traditionally
the
declaration
against
penal
interest
is
contended
by
the
government,
i
think
with
some
reason,
that
it's
a
well-established
exception
to
the
hearsay,
rooted
in
history.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well--
--so...
you're
not
arguing
here
that
the
declaration
against
penal
interest
is
not
a
firmly
rooted
principle
of
hearsay?
unknown
speaker
in
lee,
and
in
a
subsequent
case
coming
out
of
new
mexico,
didn't
we
really
describe
a
presumption
against
admitting
the
evidence,
rather
than
making
it
a
categorical
rule?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you...
can
you
prevail
here
only
if
the
court
adopts
a
categorical
rule?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
want
us
to
just
stick
by
lee
and
the
other
cases
that
we've
decided.
you
want
something
more.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't...
as
a
matter
of
general
principle,
why
shouldn't
we
leave
it
to
the
jury
to
figure
this
out
and
maybe
give
them
some
instructions?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
giving
us
a
lot
of
facts
here
about
why
harris'
declaration
wasn't
trustworthy.
couldn't
those
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
certainly
got
the
ability
to
bring
some
of
the
facts
before
the
jury,
as
you
indicate.
you
don't
have
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
harris,
and
that's
what
hearsay
exceptions
are
all
about.
unknown
speaker
what
about...
is
it
untrustworthy
to
the
extent
that
they
incriminated
harris
himself?
how
about
letting
in
that
much
of
his
statement?
unknown
speaker
on
the
ground
that
those
are
not
against
harris'
penal
interest--
unknown
speaker
--and
on
the
contrary
they
tend
to
make
him
a
lesser
actor
in
this
criminal
affair.
unknown
speaker
what
would
your
rule
be
if
the
statement
which
inculpated
the
defendant
also
included
admissions
against
the
declarant
which
went
beyond
anything
the
police
might
have
known
at
that
point?
would
your
broad
principle
apply
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we're
worried
about
that,
we
won't
let
anything
in.
i
mean,
the
argument
for
keeping
out
the
statement
or
the
portion
of
the
statement
that
you
object
to
is
that
it's
too
much
in
the
declarant's
interest
to
make
it,
and
to
make
it
falsely,
but
if
that
is
in
fact
part
of
the...
if
that
occurs
in
a
context
in
which
the
declarant
is
also
making
it
worse
for
himself
by
admitting
more
than
the
police
would
have
had
against
him
at
that
point,
doesn't
that
lend
a
note
of
probity
to
the
statement,
and
therefore
shouldn't
your
broad
principle
of
exclusion
fall
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
but
the
danger
is
less...
i
take
it
you
would
agree
the
danger
is
less
in
the
case
that
i
put.
unknown
speaker
because
he
was
afraid--
--can
you
bring
that
out
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
not
as
if
you
can't
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
the
factfinder.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
defendant
take
the
stand
here,
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
did
harris...
was
harris
called
to
testify
in
front
of
the
jury,
and
did
he
take
the
fifth
in
the
presence
of
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
but
he
could
have
been?
he
could
have
been
brought
into
the
courtroom,
sworn,
and
had
the
jury
see
him?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
happened
all
the
time,
because
that's
one
of
the
circumstances
the
jury
can
then
consider.
i've
had
it
happen
in
courtrooms
where
i've
been
presiding.
unknown
speaker
but
here
the
invocation
was
before
the
judge,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
the
judge
offered
the
witness
immunity.
unknown
speaker
and
the
witness
said
no,
and
then
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
mr.
waxman,
what
are
your
best
authorities
for...
under
the
federal
rule
here
that
the
state
would
invoke?
tell
us
how
much
of
this
statement
should
come
in.
if
it
is
a
declaration
against
penal
interest,
what
are
your
best
authorities
in
support
of
a
requirement
of
redaction,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
it's
sort
of
surprising
that
there
isn't
more
authority
for
the
meaning
of
the
rule
in
terms
of
what
comes
in
along
with
the
statement,
whether
related
statements
come
in,
or
they
don't,
or
whether
redaction
is
required.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
this
statement
had
been
redacted
to
strike
out
the
name
of
williamson,
would
you
be
here
today?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
be
relevant--
unknown
speaker
--perhaps,
or
would
it?
would
it
have
been
relevant,
still?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
relevant?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
would
introduce...
the
state
is
trying
to
say
someone
else
made
the
arrangements
for
this
cocaine
distribution,
and
it
would
introduce
testimony
by
the
person
who
had
it
in
the
car
that,
indeed,
someone
else
did,
and
the
state's
trying
to
prove
that
someone
else
is
williamson.
why,
it
would
certainly
he
relevant--
unknown
speaker
--so
it
would
get
in.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
would
get
in.
is
all
that
you're
arguing...
are
you
just
arguing
before
us
a
question
of
fact,
that
rule
804(b)(3)
was
applied
incorrectly?
unknown
speaker
why
would
we
want
to
go
beyond
that?
i
mean,
really
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
statement
there
that
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
position
would
not
have
made
the
statement
unless
believing
it
to
be
true,
what
you're
telling
us
is,
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why
somebody
in
this
position
would
make
it
without
believing
it
to
be
true,
therefore
804(b)(3)
was
not
met.
unknown
speaker
why
should
the
guidance
be
anything
more
than,
take
that
line
seriously,
and
you
can
say,
to
the
extent
that
the
statement
is
purely
self-serving,
that
it
doesn't
satisfy
that
requirement.
to
the
extent
that
it
incriminates
the
speaker
himself,
it
does
fit
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
you
conceded
earlier,
and
i
think
you're
sticking
to
it,
that
to
the
extent
it
incriminated
harris,
it
could
come
in.
there
was
evidence
placing
williamson
together
with
harris
and
connecting
them
both
to
that
vehicle,
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
so
there
would
be
some
relevance
to
having
harris
say,
yes,
i
was
the
courier,
and
then
there
were
at
least
three
items
of
evidence
that
connected
williamson
to
the
car.
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
evidence,
just
his
name
on
the
rental
agreement?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
extent
of
the
evidence
that
connected
him
with
the
vehicle?
unknown
speaker
was
there
some
correspondence,
something
with...
or
am
i
confusing
this
with
another
situation,
something
with
a
girlfriend?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
a
relative.
unknown
speaker
yes.
she
was
not
his
girlfriend.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they're
inextricably
intertwined,
that
in
two
or
three
sentences,
each
sentence
has
some
declaration
against
penal
interest,
but
also
some
inculpation
of
third
parties?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
they're
coercive
statements,
custodial
atmosphere,
that's
a...
presumably
the
miranda
warnings
take
care
of
that,
so
i
mean,
we're
not...
i
would
think
we
wouldn't
be
arguing
that
point
here.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
agree
that
the
parts
that
incriminated
harris
and
the
parts
that
incriminated
williamson
were
inextricably
intertwined
here.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
manning,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
manning,
under
the
plain
language
of
the
rule,
how
much
of
this
statement
can
the
government
get
in,
or
is
there
some
requirement
that
we
analyze
the
statement
and
each
part
of
it
to
see
whether
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
shoes
would
have
made
it
and
thought
it...
wouldn't
have
made
it
unless
he
thought
it
were
true,
because
there
is
some
concern
here
that
insofar
as
the
statement
implicates
williamson,
perhaps
it
doesn't
meet
that
requirement.
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
it
have
to
meet
the
requirement
of
the
rule
itself
to
be
admitted?
unknown
speaker
and
can
it,
insofar
as
williamson
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
insofar
as
the
declarant
is
seemingly
trying,
or
could
be
seen
as
trying
to
minimize
the
declarant's
own
role
when
caught
red-handed
and
have
the
major
offender
be
somebody
else,
maybe
it
doesn't
meet
that
test.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
if
portions
of
the
statement
don't
meet
that
requirement
of
the
rule,
that
the
statement
can
be
redacted
and
offered,
then,
in
a
lesser
version,
or
redacted
version?
unknown
speaker
is
that
possible
in
an
appropriate
case?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
say
that's
not--
unknown
speaker
--what
the
court
can
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
in
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
proper
use
of
a
redacted
statement.
this
is
williamson's
trial,
and
you
have
a
declaration
from
harris,
and
harris
says,
in
effect,
what
he
said
in
this
case
about
williamson,
and
the
judge
is
supposed
to
admit
that
on
the
issue
of
williamson's
guilt,
although
all
references
to
williamson's
name
are
stricken?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
to
be
redacted.
unknown
speaker
justice
o'connor
i
thought
early
asked
you...
earlier...
whether
there
would
be
some
situations
where
you
couldn't
get
the
declaration
in
verbatim,
but
it
would
be
proper
to
get
it
in
with
the
name
of
the
person
on
trial,
the
defendant,
redacted,
and--
unknown
speaker
--an
example
of
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
no--
unknown
speaker
--he
was
pretty
far
under
water
before
he
started.
unknown
speaker
all
this
stuff
in
the
trunk
of
a
rented
car--
unknown
speaker
--and
he
was
worried
about
being
found
guilty.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
you
say
that
there
should
not
be
a
per
se
rule,
that
custodial
statements
should
be
excluded.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree,
however,
that
it
makes
a
big
difference
whether
this
statement
was
made
to
police
officers
while
he
was
in
custody
on
the
one
hand,
or
the
same
statement
being
made
to
a
friend
which
was
tape
recorded
on
another
hand?
unknown
speaker
it
would
make
quite
a
difference,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
testifying--
unknown
speaker
--well,
wouldn't
a
reasonable--
--isn't
it
obvious
that
a
reasonable
person
in
declarant's
position
might
well
have
made
precisely
this
statement,
even
if
there
wasn't
a
word
of
truth
in
it?
unknown
speaker
of
this
very
case,
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
the
position
that
no
reasonable
person
would
have
made
this
statement
unless
he
believed
it
was
true,
in
declarant's
position,
had
been
caught
with
all
this
stuff--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
no
one
would
try
to
pass
the
blame
onto
a
third
party?
unknown
speaker
mr.
manning,
isn't
the
most
logical
inference
that
when
somebody
is
caught
red-handed,
has
every
incentive
to
put
the
blame
on
somebody
else,
and
that
that...
putting
the
blame
on
the
other
person
has
no
reasonable...
why
would
anyone
have
reason
to
believe
that
putting
the
blame
on
somebody
else
is
true?
i
mean,
he's
caught
with
the
goods,
and
he
says,
well,
i
was
a
lesser...
i
was
only
the
courier.
unknown
speaker
williamson
was
the
big
guy.
why
would
anyone
say
that
there
are
reasonable
assurances
that
that
latter
part
is
true?
unknown
speaker
but
as
far
as
harris
is
concerned,
harris
paints
himself
as
the
courier,
right--
unknown
speaker
--the
one
who
arranged
it
and
not
the
one
to
whom
the
delivery
was
being
made?
unknown
speaker
that
much
is
against
his
penal
interests,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
quarrel
about
that.
mr.
waxman
said,
yes,
that
much
can
come
in.
to
the
extent
that
he
is
incriminating
williamson,
that
harris
is
incriminating
williamson,
how
is
that
against
harris'
penal
interest?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
unknown
speaker
in
determining
whether
it's
against
penal
interest,
it
is
not
merely
a
kind
of
a
schoolroom
textbook
analysis
of
whether
there's
an
additional
element
of
criminal
liability,
but
also
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
is
maybe
he
thought
this
would
give
him
more
lenient
treatment
from
the
prosecutor
because
he
was
cooperating
with
the
police,
and
shouldn't
that
be
evaluated
in
determining
whether
the
net
value
was
against
his
penal
interest?
unknown
speaker
and
so
if
we
have
a
case
in
which
the
substantial
motive
for
making
the
statement
is
to
obtain
more
lenient
treatment,
what
ought
the
result
to
be?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
substantial
motive
is
to
obtain
leniency,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
undercuts
the
rationale
of
the
rule.
the
rationale
of
the
rule
is
that
you
wouldn't
make
this
statement
unless
it
were
true
if
it's
against
penal
interest,
but
we're
hypothesizing
now
a
situation
in
which
the
penal
interest
is
irrelevant.
what
you
are
trying
to
do
is
to
better
your
condition,
is
to
obtain
leniency.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
want
to
make
clear
what
your
position
is.
mr.
manning--
--if
the
predominant
motive
in
making
the
statement
is
to
obtain
leniency,
is
that
a
statement
against
penal
interest
and
therefore
admissible?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
it
against
penal
interest
if
the
dominant
motive
is
to
obtain
leniency?
unknown
speaker
is
the
district
court
always
well-situated
to
determine
what
a
person's
dominant
motive
or
prevailing
motive
was
in
making
a
statement?
unknown
speaker
why
should
we
ask
any
factfinder
involved
in
this
evidentiary...
to
make
a
finding
as
to
what
someone's
dominant
motive
was?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
true
with
respect
to
any
hearsay,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
manning,
at
least
getting
away
from
the
question
of
motive,
you
would
at
least...
i
take
it
you
would
admit
that
it
would
be
a
correct
statement
to
say
that
if
the
trial
court
reasonably
reads
the
statement
as
conferring
a
net
benefit
on
its
face
as
conferring
a
net
benefit
upon
the
declarant,
that
it
would
be
inadmissible.
you
agree
to
that,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
always
have
something
to
be
gained
by
making
a
statement
which
is
in
effect
net
in
your
favor?
unknown
speaker
but
there,
there--
unknown
speaker
--there
are
certainly
limits,
though,
to
which
a
reasonable
person
would
go
and
simply
casting
blame
on
someone
else,
if,
you
know,
the
police
are
going
to
look
into
it
and
say,
gee,
this
is
just
a
bunch
of
bunk
you
told
us,
i
mean,
a
reasonable
person
isn't
just
going
to
make
perfectly
wild
statements
in
hope
of
getting
some
sort
of
deal.
unknown
speaker
mr.
manning,
i
assume
that
the
reasonable
person
referred
to
in
the
rule
is
a
reasonable
person
who
has
no
compunction
about
lying,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
a
reasonable
person
who
doesn't
mind
lying
under
oath.
unknown
speaker
but
he's
not
under
oath.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
like
the
implication
anyway.
unknown
speaker
mr.
manning,
could
these
statements
have
come
in
anyway
under
the
coconspirator
exception,
or
were
they
no
longer
made
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
the
prosecutor
talked
him
out
of
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do,
but
there
has
been
a
lot
of
strong
language
in
a
number
of
this
court's
cases,
a
recent
one
being
lee
v.
illinois,
about
the
untrustworthiness
of
this
kind
of
statement.
you
do
have
to
acknowledge
that
and
deal
with
it.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
that
most
of
the
time
the
defendant...
or,
pardon
me,
the
declarant
makes
the
statement
because
he
thinks
it's
in
his
net
benefit?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
then.
the
penal
interest
rule
that
you're
advocating
rests
on
the
assumption
that
most
of
the
time
these
statements
are
made
even
though
it
is
not
to
the
defendant's
net
benefit,
as
he
understands
it,
to
make
them.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
the
calculus
change
when
there
are
multiple
defendants?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
manning.
you
have
5
minutes
remaining,
mr.
waxman.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
