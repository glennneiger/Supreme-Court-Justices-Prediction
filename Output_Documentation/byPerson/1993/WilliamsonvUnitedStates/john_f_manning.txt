mr.
john
f.
manning
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
argues
that
an
inculpatory
confession
made
by
an
accomplice
to
the
police
while
he's
in
custody
should
be
excluded
per
se
under
the
rules
of
evidence
and
under
the
confrontation
clause.
that
contention,
however,
finds
no
support
either
in
the
rules
or
in
this
court's
confrontation
clause
cases.
as
to
the
rules,
petitioner's
argument
would
mean
that
no
matter
how
overwhelmingly
all
of
the
other
circumstances
of
the
case
pointed
to
the
admissibility
of
a
statement
under
the
rule,
the
district
court
would
be
required
to
exclude
any
such
statement
as
long
as
it
was
made
by
an
accomplice
to
the
police
while
the
declarant
was
in
custody.
so
if
you
think
about
this
situation,
if
someone
went
to
the
police
and
was
in
custody
and
said,
i
murdered
fred,
took
the
watch
off
of
his
wrist,
and
sold
it
to
joe,
that
statement
would
have
to
be
excluded
in
joe's
trial
for
possession
of
stolen
goods.
in
other
words
under
petitioner's
view,
no
district
court
could
find
that
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
position
would
not
have
made
the
statement
admitting
to
a
capital
crime,
and
at
the
same
time
implicating
someone
else
in
a
misdemeanor.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
can
be
sustained
under
the
plain
language
of
the
rule.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
there
are
two
distinct
answers
to
that.
one
comes
from
the
advisory
committee
note
itself.
in
the
advisory
committee
note,
and
this
is
cited
on
page
23
of
our
brief,
the
advisory
committee
explained
that
a
third
party
confession
may
include
statements
implicating
the
accused,
and
under
the
general
theory
of
declarations
against
interest,
they
would
be
admissible
as
related
statements.
now,
that
is
consistent
with
the
common
law
tradition
of
statements
against
interest
which,
although--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
yes,
we
think
it
absolutely
can,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
if
you
just
think
about
when
somebody
is
making
a
statement
against
penal
interest
and
describing
his
role
in
an
offense,
in
describing
that
role,
he
says
more
than
just
the
core,
i
robbed
the
bank.
he
will
say,
i
robbed
the
riggs
national
bank,
georgetown
branch,
on
tuesday
at
11:00
a.m.,
and
there
are
lots
of
facts
that
are
part
of
that
statement
against
interest
that
if
you
took
them
in
isolation
might
not
be
strictly
against
the
declarant's
interest,
but
in
the--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
we
think
that
the
court
absolutely
has
to
look
at
the
statement
as
a
whole
and
make
a
determination
of
whether
the
entire
statement
is
actually
in
the
declarant's
penal
interest.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
we
think
that
that
would
not
be
appropriate
in
a
case
like
this,
where--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--it's
certainly...
it's
certainly
possible.
mr.
john
f.
manning
no,
it--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--it
would
certainly
be
appropriate
in
the
right
kind
of
case,
but
we
would
say
that
the
right
kind
of
case
would
be
a
case
where
the
other
statement
would
not
be
related,
or
would
not
be
against
the
declarant's
penal
interest,
and
let
me
give
you
an
example,
if
i
may,
of
the
distinction
that
we
would
draw
in
this
situation.
if
the
declarant
says,
joe
and
i
robbed
the
bank,
then
that
statement,
the
entire
statement
is
against
the
declarant's
penal
interest,
because
he
has
not
only
admitted
that
he
robbed
a
bank,
he
has
admitted
that
he
has
committed
a
conspiracy
with
joe
to
rob
the
bank
and
the
entire
statement
would
come
in
as
being
against
his
penal
interest.
now,
if
he
says,
it's
ironic,
i
robbed
a
bank
today,
and
joe
robbed
a
bank
yesterday,
well,
the
second
part
of
that
statement
would
be
excluded
because
it
wouldn't
be
related,
it
wouldn't
be
integral
to
his
description
of
his
own
offense,
and
that
statement
would
be
redacted
when
the
statement
against
penal
interest
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
f.
manning
no,
he
absolutely
should
not
strike
the
references
to
williamson's
name.
mr.
john
f.
manning
oh,
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
all
i
was
explaining
was
that
in
a
situation
like
that,
where
there
is
a
statement
that
includes
parts,
some
of
which
have
no
relationship
to
the
declarant's
description
of
the
offense,
it
may--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--oh,
no--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--we
don't
think
that
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
john
f.
manning
when
the
declarant
argue...
when
the
declarant
says,
i
was
making
this
delivery
to
williamson,
williamson
acquired
the
cocaine
and
i
was
taking
it
over
state
lines,
all
of
those
statements
are
against
the
declarant,
harris'
penal
interest,
because
he
is
telling
the
police
that
he
is
involved
in
a
conspiracy
with
williamson,
that
he
and
williamson
are
engaged
in
the
offense
of
traveling
across
state
lines
for
the
purposes
of
engaging
in
the
business
of
distributing
controlled
substances,
and
each
detail
that
harris
gave
of
the
offense
helped
to
sink
him
further,
not
only
in
the
sense
that
it
described
elements
of
offenses
that
he--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
he
was--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--he
was--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--he
was
fairly
far
under
water,
but
his
nose
was
still
above
the
surface--
[laughter]
--and
what
he
gave
up...
what
he
gave
up
by
his
confession
was
the
element
of
knowledge.
i
mean,
we
think
that--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that
is--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that
is
certainly
a
factor
for
the
district
court
to
consider
in
its
consideration
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
what
the
district
court
has
to
find
under
this
rule
is
not
only
that
the
statement
the
declarant
made
was...
would
tend
to
subject
him
to
criminal
liability--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--but
that
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
position
would
not
have
made
this
statement
unless
believing
it
to
be
true.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
we
think
that...
are
you
asking
about
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case?
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
we
think
that
there
are
several
circumstances.
obviously,
there
is
a
serious
issue
under
the
rule
in
this
case,
but
we
think
there
are
a
variety
of
circumstances
that
support
the
district
court's
determination
that
the
rule
properly
applied.
mr.
john
f.
manning
we
think--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--we
think
that
the
district
court
was
justified
in
making
that
finding,
which
is
the
inquiry
for
this
court,
and
the
reason--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
in
fact,
we
think
that
he
did
not
try
to
minimize
his
role
in
the
offense
in
the
way
that
you
describe,
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg.
this
is
not
a
case
where
somebody
is
caught
selling
baggies
of
dope
on
the
streets
and
says,
look,
i'm
just
the
agent
here,
the
kingpin
works
in
that
convenience
store
and
i'll
give
you
his
name
in
exchange
for
a
deal.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
declarant
admitted
his
full
participation
in
a
conspiracy
to
transport
approximately
10
million
dollars
worth
of
cocaine
from
florida
to
georgia
for
distribution.
now,
to
be
sure,
he
said
that
williamson
arranged
the
acquisition,
and
that
the
delivery
was
to
williamson,
but
he
did
not
portray
himself
as
a
bit
player
in
this
conspiracy,
and
the
statements
he
made
not
only
conceded
knowledge
that
the
cocaine
was
in
his
trunk,
and
by
the
way,
we
think
that
these
facts
are
more
significant
than
petitioner
suggests.
the
cocaine
was
in
the
trunk
of
a
rental
car,
petitioner's
name
was
on
the
rental
agreement,
there
was
an
envelope
addressed
to
petitioner
in
the
glove
compartment,
a
receipt
bearing
his
girlfriend's
address
in
the
glove
compartment,
and
the
drugs
were
in
a
suitcase
that
had
petitioner's
sister's
initials
on
it.
now,
if
someone
were
to--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--but--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--but
in
this
case,
painting
yourself
as
a
courier
is
a
very
significant
role
in
the
offense,
and
it
subjected
him
to
charges
not
only
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
but
also
conspiracy.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
certainly
in
a
case
like
this,
where
you're
describing
your
role
in
a
conspiracy,
every
detail
that
you
give
to
the
police
helps
to
sink
you
further.
it
is
rare
that
you
find
a
case
where
the
government
prosecutes
somebody
on
the
basis
of
a
naked
confession.
mr.
john
f.
manning
sure.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that
is
certainly
a
factor
for
the
district
court
to
consider
in
considering
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
again,
it
depends
on
what
other
circumstances
obtain.
if
you
take
the
example
that
i
gave
of
the
guy
admitting
to
a
murder
and
implicating
someone
else
in
the
receipt
of
stolen
goods,
then
that's
a
situation
where,
even
if
the
motive
of
the
person
was
to
seek
lenient
treatment,
you
would
have
to
think
that
his
self-incrimination
in
a
capital
crime
of
murder
would
overcome
any
doubt
about
the
accuracy
of
his
statement
arising
from
his
desire
to
curry
favor
by
handing
over
the
person
to
whom
he
gave
the
stolen
watch
that
he
took
off
of
the
murder
victim.
now,
the
most
important
point,
though,
that
we
would
like
to
make
is
that
in
any
of
these
situations
the
district
court
should
be
trusted
to
weigh
the
circumstances.
it
is
absolutely
relevant
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
declarant
made
the
statement
with
the
idea
of
currying
favor
or
getting
leniency
from
the
authorities
in
exchange
for
giving
up
a
cohort.
mr.
john
f.
manning
if
the
district
court
finds,
based
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
the
statement
that
the
declarant
made
was
in
his
penal
interest
in
the
sense
that
he
inculpated
someone
else
in
an
effort
to
gain
leniency,
then
that
certainly
would
be
a
finding
that
should
be
sustained
and
it
would
be
a
proper
application
of
the
rule.
our
point
is
that
in
making
that
determination,
the
court
should
not
adopt
a
per
se
rule
that
places
talismanic
significance
on
questions
of
custody
or
of
whether
the
declarant
made
the
statement
to
the
police.
mr.
john
f.
manning
again,
i
think
that
it's
very
difficult
to
answer
that
question
without
knowing
all
of
the
facts
that
surround
the
statement,
but
it
would
be
a
factor--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
because
if
the
dominant
motive
is
to
obtain
leniency,
but
the
declarant
makes
a
statement
that
is
very,
very
strongly
against
his
penal
interest
and
the
district
court
concludes
that
no
one
in
the
declarant's
position
under
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case...
for
example,
he
has
admitted
to
a
murder,
and
his
quest
for
leniency
will
gain
him
very
little...
if
the
district
court
in
those
circumstances
makes
the
determination
that
no
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
circumstances
would
have
made
the
statement
unless
believing
it
to
be
true,
then
the
district
court
would
appropriately
admit
that
statement
under
rule
804(b)(3).
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
the
district
court
has
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence
that
is
submitted
by
the
government
and
by
the
defendant
in
making
the
determination.
we
think
that
the
district
court
is
among
the
various
actors
who
could
make
that
determination,
the
best-situated.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
because
what
the
district
court
has
to...
the
determination
that
the
district
court
has
to
make
is
whether
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
position
would
have
a
motive
to
fabricate
his
confession,
and
in
that
sense
the
district
court
inevitably
is
making
an
inquiry
into
what
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
position
would
be
motivated
by.
now,
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
chief
justice
had
mentioned
earlier
the
possibility
that
the
jury
would
be
able
to
weigh
the
various
circumstances
that
surround
the
making
of
the
statement,
and
i
would
like
to
reinforce
that
point
by
noting
that
under
rule
806
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
a
declarant
can
be
impeached
as
to
a
hearsay...
the
credibility
of
a
declarant
can
be
impeached
with
respect
to
a
hearsay
statement
to
the
same
extent
as
a
person
making
the
same
statement
in
court
in
live
testimony.
so
not
only
is
it
possible
for
the
jury
to
weigh
the
evidence
that
is
submitted
pursuant
to
a
hearsay
statement
admitted
under
rule
804(b)(3),
but
it's
also
possible
for
the
defense
to
impeach
the
declarant's
testimony
under
rule
806,
and
bring
out
any
bias
or
motive
or
interest
that
the
declarant
might
have
had
in
making
this
statement,
including--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that's
true
about
any
hearsay,
and
the
court
has
relied
on
rule
806
in
holding
that,
for
example,
coconspirator's
statements
can
be
admitted
pursuant
to
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception,
because
it
mitigates
the
concern
that
surrounds
the
admission
of
hearsay.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
i
think
we
would
prefer
to
put
it
in
terms
of
the
rule
itself,
that
the
district
court
found
that
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
position
would
make
the
statement
even
though
he
did
not
believe
it
was
true,
that
is,
if
he
had
some
benefit,
something
to
gain
by
fabricating
a
statement,
then
absolutely
the
district
court
would
properly
exclude
that
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
i
suppose
if
you
put
it
that
way
you
would
have
something
to
gain
if
the
statement
were
net
in
your
favor.
if
the
declarant
gained
a
great
deal
by
inculpating
someone
else...
for
example,
a
situation
might
be
if
you
had
a
defendant
and
the
police
said,
we
will
cut
your
sentence
in
half
if
you
roll
over
on
your
cohort,
and
the
declarant
said,
fine,
you
know,
i'll...
you
know,
i'll
give
a
statement,
and
then
he
refuses
to
testify,
that
would
be
a
situation--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--where
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
make
the
finding
that
a
reasonable
person
in
those
circumstances
would
have
fabricated
the
statement.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
it's
important
to
give
the
district
court
the
latitude
it
needs
to
look
at
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
we
think
that
a
situation
like
that
occurred
when
harris
revised
his
statement
at
6:00
p.m.
in
response
to
agent
walton's
setting
up
a
controlled
delivery.
as
petitioner
mentioned,
earlier
in
the
day,
harris
had
made
the
statement
that
he
had
gotten
the
drugs
from
a
cuban
and
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
controlled
delivery
to
a
dumpster
in
atlanta
at
10:30
p.m.--
and
then
when
agent
walton
questioned
harris
at
6:00
p.m.
that
evening,
he
finished
his
questioning,
he
stood
up
to
go
make
a
controlled
delivery,
and
harris
stood
up
and
said,
i
can't
let
you
go
through
with
it,
it's
not
true,
what
i
told
you
is
false,
and
he
revised
his
story,
giving
details
about...
that
petitioner
was
driving
in
front
of
him
in
a
rented
lincoln
continental
and
he
saw
the
arrest,
and
therefore
there
could
be
no
controlled
delivery
because
petitioner
knew
that
he...
that
harris
had
been
arrested.
now,
those
circumstances
vouch
for
the
reliability
of
the
statement
that
harris
made
at
that
point,
because
he
would
have
been
in
much
greater
trouble
if
he
had
fabricated
them
at
that
point.
the
dea
could
certainly
have
verified
if
petitioner
had
a
rented
lincoln
continental
on
the
day
that
harris
said
he
did,
and
certainly
if
harris
was
fabricating
there
was
a
chance
that
petitioner
would
have
a
credible
alibi,
and
the
government
could
have
gone
through
with
the
controlled
delivery,
and
if
harris
had
been
lying
at
that
point
he
would
have
opened
himself
up
to
charges
of
obstruction
of
justice,
so--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--a
reasonable
person
who
has--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
it
would
have
to
suppose
that
a
reasonable
person
calculating
the
advantage
of
telling
a
lie
would
tell
a
lie
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
john
f.
manning
he's
not
under
oath,
that's
true.
that's
true.
before
i--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--neither
do
i.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
the
district
court
initially
suggested
that
they
would
come
in
under
the
coconspirator
exception,
but
made
no--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--the
prosecutor
did
talk
him
out
of
it,
and
we
believe
the
conspiracy
had
probably
terminated
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
although
in
connection
with
that,
i'd
like
to
use
that
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
it's
important
in
all
of
these
cases
that
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
we
trust
district
courts
to
make
determinations
about
the
admissibility
of
hearsay
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
and
trust
the
district
courts
to
evaluate
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
in
most
cases,
when
someone
is--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--we
do
acknowledge
that,
and
we
agree
that
in
making
an
evaluation
about
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
what
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
position
would
do
when
you're
dealing
with
somebody
who
is
in
police
custody,
the
district
court
must
be
sensitive
to
the
pressures
and
to
the
circumstances
that
would
indicate
whether
the
declarant
in
the
particular
case
had
given
up
someone
else
in
order
to
make
a
deal
or
to
get
leniency.
mr.
john
f.
manning
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
often
you
have
people
who
are
confronted
with
having
been
caught
in
a
crime
who
make
statements
that
are
very
much
against
their
penal
interest.
i
mean,
in
this
case
itself
the
officer
pulled
harris
over
and
was
questioning
him
about
his
weaving
in
traffic,
and
he
asked
harris,
may
i
search
your
trunk,
and
harris
said
yes,
knowing
that
there
were
19
kilograms
of
cocaine
in
the
trunk.
people
all
the
time
make
statements
to
the
authorities
that
are
against
their
penal
interest,
and
if
they
didn't
we
would
very
rarely
catch
criminals.
mr.
john
f.
manning
and
that's
the
very
premise
of
the
longstanding
exception
for
declarations
against
interest.
almost
as
early
as
the
hearsay
rule
itself
developed,
the
courts
developed
an
exception
for
statements
against
interest.
statements
against
pecuniary
interest
and
proprietary
interest
were
the
first
ones
to
develop,
and
the
supposition
is
that
people
don't
say
things
against
their
own
interest
if
they
are
lying,
and
that
gives--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--the
calculus
may
very
well
change
when
there
are
multiple
defendants,
but
the
district
court
is
perfectly
situated
to
evaluate
all
of
the
factors
and
circumstances
in
determining
whether
the
calculus
has
changed
in
a
way
such
that
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
position
would
fabricate
his
story
in
order
to
gain
advantage
from
the
authorities.
i
mean,
our
basic...
in
all
sorts
of
contexts,
we
trust
the
district
court
to
assess
the
probativeness
of
evidence,
and
this
court
has
been
very
reluctant
to
shackle
district
courts
in
the
context
of
admitting
hearsay
with
per
se
rules
that
restrict
their
ability
to
consider
the
whole
picture
in
deciding
whether
something
fits
within
a
hearsay
exception.
in
bourjaily,
the
court
rejected
a
per
se
rule
forbidding
district
courts
from
considering
hearsay
evidence
in
determining
the
admissibility
of
statements
pursuant
to
the
coconspirator
exception.
in
idaho
v.
wright,
the
court
rejected
a
per
se
rule
that
would
prevent
district
courts
from
allowing
the
introduction
of
hearsay
that
was
made
by
a
witness
who
was
unavailable
because
she
was
determined
to
be
incompetent.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
confrontation
clause
and
the
principal
purpose,
we
would
submit,
is
to
further
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
trial,
and
if
petitioner's
view
is
accepted,
a
district
court
looking
at
an
array
of
circumstances,
if
confronted
with
the
fact
of
custody,
will
have
to
ignore
every
other
fact,
put
on
blinders,
and
say,
this
statement
doesn't
come
in.
we
think
that's
contrary
to
the
general
approach
of
this
court
and
the
lower
courts,
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
and
it's
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
rule
804(b)(3).
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
