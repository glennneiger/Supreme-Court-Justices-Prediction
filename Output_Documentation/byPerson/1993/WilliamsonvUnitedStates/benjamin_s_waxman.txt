mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
calls
upon
this
court
to
make
clear
what
it
has
indicated
in
every
case
on
this
issue
in
the
past
30
years,
and
that
is
that
a
postarrest
statement
of
an
uncross-examined
alleged
accomplice,
made
in
the
throngs
of
custodial
interrogation,
which
implicates
a
defendant,
is
inadmissible.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
the
inherent
and
unique
untrustworthiness
of
these
statements.
they
are
made
in
the
coercive
atmosphere
of
police
interrogation.
they
are
made
under
circumstances
when
the
declarant
has
every
motive
to
speak
without
regard
to
the
truth.
these
are
desperate
people
in
desperate
times.
people
that
are
arrested,
their
lives
pass
before
their
eyes,
and
they
were
motivated
to
speak
in
order
to
curry
favor,
in
order
to
assist
their
own
situation,
and
for
the
same
reason
that
is
why
they
attempt
to
shift
blame
to
someone
else,
to
put
the
light
on
a
different
person,
and
to
divert
the
attention
from
themselves.
the
government
in
this
case
recognized
the
inadmissibility
of
these
statements,
of
harris'
statements,
when
it
took
the
extraordinary
measure
of
moving
to
sever
harris,
the
declarant
in
this
case,
from
williamson,
the
defendant.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
harris,
which
was
the
person
whose
statement
we're
concerned
with.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
the
declarant.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
i'm
sorry.
harris'
statements
in
this
case
graphically
demonstrate
the
validity
of
this
presumption
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
and
why
today
this
court
should
make
these
statements
categorically
inadmissible.
he
was
explained...
in
custody
he
was
told
that
he
would
be
advised
what
benefit
he
would
receive
for
making
statements,
cooperative
statements.
he
knew
that
the
thing
he
needed
to
do
was
to
finger
someone
else.
that's
what
he
could
do
to
relieve
the
burden
that
was
placed
on
him
at
this
moment.
that's
something
that
everyone
his
shoes
knows
they
need
to
do
in
order
to
get
out
from
under
the
criminal
justice
system
at
that
time.
they
don't
need
to
be
promised.
they
know
it
instinctively.
the
mere
suggestion
in
this
case
that
some
benefit
might
inure
if
he
cooperated
was
enough
to
effect
his
state
of
mind
so
that
he
would
speak,
regardless
of
the
truth
of
what
he
said.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
he
admitted
very
minimally
that
he
was
a
courier,
that
he
was
someone
who
was
following
directions,
he
was
a
mule.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
that's
correct,
and
even
without
his
statements
the
courts
have
sustained
conviction
after
conviction
based
on
an
individual's
presence
in
a
vehicle
under
these
statements
without
even
the
incriminating
statements.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
there
was
a
conspiracy
charge.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
the
broad
exclusionary
principle
would
be
that
these
types
of
statements...
in
other
words,
statements
of
uncross-examined,
alleged
accomplices
such
as
harris,
which
are
made
in
the
throngs
of
custodial
interrogation
which
implicate
in
a
self-serving
way
a
defendant
such
as
williamson,
should
categorically
be
excluded.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
we
do
disagree
with
that,
but
i
think
the
focus
of
this
court
should
be
on
this
peculiar
narrow
category
of
statements
that
falls
within
the
general
category,
and
this
is
what
the
court
discussed
in
lee.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
i
believe
that
it
is,
but
i
don't
believe
the
court
needs
to
get
to
that
issue.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
no.
i
think
under...
certainly
under
the
facts
of
our
case,
the
statement
failed
to
not
only
meet
the
requirements
of
the
rule,
804(b)(3),
they
certainly
failed
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
confrontation
clause,
and
we
should
indeed
prevail,
but
i--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--i
think
in...
today,
with
30
years
of
experience
of
these
types
of
statements,
and
seeing
the
validity
of
the
presumption
and,
indeed,
that
these
statements
are
categorically,
inherently,
and
uniquely
untrustworthy...
any
person
in
this
position
instinctively
will
seek
to
curry
favor
and
to
lay
blame
elsewhere.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
because
the
jury
was
never
presented
with
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
to
be
able
to
fairly
evaluate
this
statement.
that's
precisely
the
problem.
by
denying
the
defendant
the
ability
to
cross-examine
the
declarant,
in
this
case
harris,
the
defendant
was
unable
to
show
why
harris
was
motivated
to
falsely
implicate
williamson.
the
jury
was...
this
evidence
was
kept
from
the
jury,
and
the
judge
could
only
speculate
on
the
state
of
mind
of
harris
and
why
he
would
make
a
statement
implicating
williamson.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
some
of
them
could
be.
for
instance,
certainly
the
jury
was
made
aware
that
the
agents
advised
him
that
any
cooperation
he
gave
would
be
reported
to
the
prosecutor,
but
do
we
know
that
that's
really
what
happened
in
this
circumstance?
don't
we
really
need
harris
to
find
out
whether
a
firm
promise
had
been
made,
or
what
impact
that
statement
had
on
his
mind,
and
how
it
motivated
him
to
make
this
statement?
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
that's
correct,
but
under
this
set
of
circumstances,
we're
presented
with
a
situation
that
in
every
case
is
going
to
bring
before
the
court
statements
that
are
inherently
untrustworthy.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
i
think
that
that's
a
way
that
the
court
could
go.
that
was
the
mode
of
analysis
that
chief
justice
cavanaugh
took
in
michigan,
recognizing
that,
while
a
statement
implicating
the
declarant...
the
declarant,
excuse
me...
harris
in
this
case,
may
indeed
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
rule.
the
portion
of
the
statement
that
incriminates
williamson
was
not
against
his
penal
interest,
but
indeed
was
self-serving.
that
was
the
most
and
the
best
kind
of
statement
that
harris
could
make
at
that
time
to
serve
his
own
selfish
interests,
and
so
the
court
could
certainly
allow
statements
such
as
those
that
harris
made
which
incriminated
himself,
while
excluding
statements,
collateral
statements
which
incriminate
third
parties,
which
is--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--correct,
and
indeed--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--correct,
and
particularly
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
again,
we
have
harris
saying
that
he
was
a
mere
courier.
he
was
following
the
directions
of
another.
williamson,
he
claims,
was
the
principal.
he
was
the
one
who
procured
the
cocaine,
who
arranged
for
it
to
be
transported
and
was
ultimately
going
to
be
the
recipient.
he
laid
the
bulk
of
the
blame
on
williamson,
and
we're
left
to
speculate
why,
and
the
reason
is,
is
because
he
had
every
incentive
to
lay
the
blame
on
someone
else,
and
williamson
was
denied
the
ability
to
probe
his
mind,
his
state
of
existence,
and
why
he
made
these
kinds
of
statements.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
i
think
the
broad
principle,
and
the
primary
factor,
is
that
we
are
in
the
context
of
custodial
interrogation,
a
context
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
cases
is
fraught
with
the
possibility
of
coercion,
is
fraught
with
the
concern
of
what
the
state--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--i
would
urge
that
the
court
should
adopt
a
broad
principle
that
would
be
protective
of
circumstances
such
as
this,
where
the
danger
that
the
statement
may
be
not
true
and
untrustworthy
is
great
enough
that
we
may
indeed
have--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--absolutely.
for
instance,
i
think
lee
is
a
case
much
more
similar
to
yours,
where
the
arrested
person
whose
statement
we
were
concerned
with
specifically
admitted
that
they
had
murdered
aunt
beattie.
they
had
committed
one
of
the
murders.
here,
very
differently,
we've
got
someone
minimizing
their
role
and
maximizing
the
role
of
the
person
who
is
not
present,
who
has
no
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
i
think
that
there's
definitely
a
variant
which
the
court
could
find
would
make
a
statement
more
reliable
in
your
honor's
circumstance.
there
are
numerous
other
facts
in
our
case
to
demonstrate
the
untrustworthiness
of
this
statement.
harris
refused
to
give
a
written
statement,
and
ultimately
refused
to
make
the
statement
under
oath.
he
was
granted
immunity.
the
statement
could
not
have
been
used
against
him.
the
only
thing
he
had
to
lose
by
making
the
statement
would
have
been
the
potential
prosecution
for
perjury
if
this
statement
were
false.
he
had
already
implicated
williamson.
he
had
nothing
to
lose
to
testify
under
oath,
but
he
refused,
as
he
had
refused
to
make
a
written
statement.
he
lied
to
the
police.
we
know
this.
he
made
three
different
statements.
the
statements
were
inconsistent.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
that
was
brought
out
to
the
jury,
absolutely.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
some
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
can
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
factfinder,
but
the
concern
is
that
they
do
not
get
the
full
flavor
that
they're
entitled
to
when
dealing
with
this
witness
who,
whether
present
or
absent,
was
the
most
crucial
witness
in
the
entire
case.
typically
in
a
criminal
case
the
cross-examination
of
this
type
of
person
is
the
most
riveting
moment
in
the
trial.
it
is
the
moment
that
every
person
in
the
court
knows
that
the
freedom
and
liberty
of
the
defendant
depends
upon.
if
this
witness
is
believed,
the
defendant
will
be
found
guilty,
and
if
this
witness
is
disbelieved,
the
defendant--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--no,
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
no.
that
whole
procedure
was
done--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--i
would
say...
excuse
me.
i
would
say
under
the
case
law
it
would
have
been
rather
unethical
for
the
defendant,
knowing
that
harris
had
invoked
the
fifth,
to
call
him
as
a
witness
and
to
make
him--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--it's
always
been
my
understanding
as
a
defense
attorney
that
if
i
know
a
particular
party
is
going
to
invoke
the
fifth,
then
i'm
not
permitted
to
call
that
party
and
to
have
them
invoke
their
constitutional
rights
in
front
of
the
jury,
and
then
to
argue
from
that
invocation
that...
you
know,
inferences
about
what
the
person
might
have
said
or
might
not
have
said.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
correct.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
correct.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
ultimately,
the
witness
was
held
in
contempt,
and
that
was
the
end
of
harris'
position
in
court,
and
at
that
point
the
government
went
behind
its
severance
motion
and
put
on
the
agent
to
testify
about
what
harris
said
out
of
court,
not
under
oath,
about
what
he
claims
williamson
did.
i
would
submit
that
the
hearsay
in
this
case
in
those
statements
was
even
worse
than
that
which
was
brought
in
against
sir
walter
raleigh
in
that
case
in
the
early
1600's
which
is
often
seen
as
the
genesis
of
the
confrontation
clause.
this
statement
was
not
even
under
oath.
it
was
the
worst
and
least-reliable
form
of
hearsay
that
we--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--the
case
that
we
relied
on
most
heavily
would
be
flores
out
of
the
fifth
circuit.
that's
at
985
f.
2d.
it's
a
1993
decision
in
which
that
court
recognized
that
these
statements,
again
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated,
have
unique
and
inherent
indicia
of
unreliability
because
they
are
taken
in
the
throngs
of
custodial
interrogation,
and
because
the
arrestee
is
motivated
to
speak
without
regard
to
the
truth.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
well,
quite
frankly
i
think
that
there
has
been
some
confusion
under
the
rule,
and
the
courts
have
adopted
numerous
different
ways
of
approaching
these
issues.
some
courts
have
found
that
while
these
types
of
statements
satisfy
the
first
part
of
the
rule...
in
other
words,
the
part
that
says,
if
the
statements
so
far
compromises
one's
penal
interest,
such
that
a
reasonable
person
would
not
have
made
them
unless
believing
them
to
be
true,
they've
said
that
a
statement
has
satisfied
that
portion
of
the
rule,
but
has
failed
to
satisfy
the
part
that
most
courts
have
read
into
it,
which
is
that
these
statements
have
to
be
supported
by
a
particularized
showing
of
guarantees
of
trustworthiness,
so
you
have
cases
that
have
dealt
with
it
in
that
way.
you
have
cases
that
have
found,
notwithstanding
these
circumstances
similar
to
the
ones
presented
here,
similar
to
those
recognized
in
lee,
that
have
said
we're
going
to
hold
that
these
statements
satisfy
the
rule,
that
they--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--no,
nor
would
the
statement
have
been
introduced,
because
it
would
have--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--it
would
have
had
no--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--it
would
have
had
no
relevance
in
williamson's
trial.
the
only
issue
there
was
williamson's
guilt.
he
was
not
at
the
scene
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
he
had
no
involvement
in
the
initial
law
enforcement
efforts
whatsoever.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
i
think
your
honor--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--i
think
your
honor
is
correct.
there
was
reference
to
an
unidentified--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--cuban
male
at
some
point
in
fort
lauderdale,
and
it's
true
there
was
a
conspiracy
charge
here.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
i
take
back
what
i
said.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
i
think
the
court
could
find
that
it
was
applied
incorrectly,
and
i
would
be
satisfied
with
a
ruling
to
that
extent.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
because
i
think
what
the
court
needs
to
do
is
to
give
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
on
how
to
deal
with
these
type
of
statements
which
are
often
the
most
strong
and
possibly
the
only
evidence
that
the
government
has
to
convict
a
defendant,
and
in
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--again,
with
that
kind
of
a
ruling
the
petitioner
would
prevail,
and
we
would
certainly
be
satisfied.
but
what
i
think
this
case
does
is
present
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
this
presumption
that
the
court
has
recognized
for
30
years
and
has
repeatedly
dwelled
upon,
and
to
say,
what
we
are
now
saying
is
that
these
circumstances
are
so
fraught
with
the
possibility
of
deceiving
the
factfinder
and
concealing
the
truth
that
we
are
going
to
categorically
make
any
of
these
statements
admissible
to
prevent
a
violation
of
confrontation
rights,
such
as
the
one
that
occurred
in
this
particular
case.
this
is
not
the
only
case
in
which
the
rule
has
been
inappropriately
applied
to
this
factual
circumstance.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
yes,
there
was.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
there
were,
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
his
name
was
on
the
rental
agreement.
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
was
in
his
handwriting.
there
were,
i
believe,
one
or
two
receipts
with
his
name
on
it
in
the
vehicle,
and
the
luggage
in
the
truck
bore
initials
that
matched
williamson's
sister's
name.
there
were
no
fingerprints
of
williamson
found--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--that
was
the
extent
of
it.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
the
girl...
the
connection
with
the
girlfriend,
i
believe,
was
the
initials
on
the
luggage
in
which
the
cocaine
was
found.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
no,
that
was
his
sister.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
i'm
sorry,
i
apologize.
it
was...
the
sister's
name
matched
the
initials
on
the
luggage,
and
i
believe
you're
right,
i
believe
there
was
a
piece
of
correspondence
with
the
name
of
his
girlfriend
on
it.
again,
what
the
court
should
do
is
look
at
these
statements
as
being
very
distinct,
ones
that
are
self-serving,
and
ones
that
are
not.
while
the
statement
against
harris
may
have
been
against
his
penal
interest,
certainly
the
ones
against
williamson
were
not.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
i
think,
for
instance...
the
example
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
lee,
where
there
were
references
to
"we
did
this",
and
"we
did
that",
and
i
would
urge
the
court
that...
the
court
conceivably
could
separate
that
situation
out
and
suggest
that
those
circumstances
be
separately
analyzed,
but
again,
what
i
believe
is
the
crucial
factor
here
is
the
fact
that
these
statements
again
are
made
in
the
coercive
atmosphere
of
custodial
interrogation,
and
even
those--
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
--well,
i
think
this
court's
cases
have
recognized
that
even
given
miranda
warnings,
it
could
still
be
determined
that
a
statement
was
involuntary
due
to
the
coercive
circumstances
of
the
custodial
interrogation,
but
yes,
that
conceivably
could
address
these
circumstances.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
absolutely
not,
and
again
i
think
the
contrast
here
would
be
lee,
where
there's
a
much
better
argument
that
these
statements
were
inextricably
intertwined.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
benjamin
s.
waxman
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions
at
all,
i
would
waive
my
rebuttal
time.
