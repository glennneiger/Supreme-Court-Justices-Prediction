justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
a
construction
of
any
text
in
the
statute,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
a
settled
practice
in
d.c.
when
administering
the
statute,
but
as
i
understood
your
answer,
the
d.c.
circuit
did
not
purport
to
be
construing
any
language
in
the
statute
when
it
laid
down
the
instructional
rule
that
you're
asking
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
wax,
if
we
reach
that
issue,
would
it
be
your
position
that
the
instruction
should
sometimes
be
given
not
only
at
a
defendant's
request,
in
the
case
that
you
gave
in
your
hypothesis,
but
at
the
state's
request
as
well?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
the
circumstances
be
in
which
the
state
would
be
entitled
to
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
we
had
justice
ginsburg's
law
review
article
on
the
bench
again,
wouldn't
the
prosecutor
be
free
to
make
the
argument,
judge,
the...
most
jurors
don't
know
what
ngi
means
and
i
want
them
to
know
that
anyone
found
ngi
can
walk
in
40
days.
is
the
prosecutor...
would
the
prosecutor
be
entitled
to
that
instruction?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words
the
law
review
article
wouldn't
be
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
judge
is
giving
the
instructions
on
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
the
jurors
are
shaking
their
heads
and
rolling
their
eyes,
at
that
point
he
can
exercise
discretion
and
tell
them
more?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
presume
that
if
they're
shaking
their
heads
and
rolling
their
eyes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
now
they
shake
their
heads
and
they
roll
their
eyes.
the
prosecutor
says
i
want
them
to
know
that
in
40
days
he
can
walk.
is
the
prosecutor,
on
your
view,
entitled
to
that
instruction?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
say
yes?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
we're
now
concerned
with
supervisory
authority,
and
if
our
criterion
for
exercising
supervisory
authority
is
that
the
jury
ought
to
have
an
accurate
sense
of
the
consequences
that
will
follow
upon
the
return
of
a
given
verdict,
why
doesn't
the
prosecutor
have
just
as
good
an
argument
for
saying
"he
can
walk
in
40
days
and
i
want
them
so
instructed.
"
as
the
defendant
has
for
an
instruction
"he
can't
walk
tomorrow"?
