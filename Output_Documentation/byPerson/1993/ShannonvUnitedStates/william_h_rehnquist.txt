92-8346,
terry
lee
shannon
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
trout.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
trout,
when
you
say
congress
modeled
it
closely
on
the
district
of
columbia
act,
what
do
you
mean,
that
they
looked
to
the
district
of
columbia
act
only?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
evidence
is
the
legislative
history
that
they
did
look
at
the
district
of
columbia
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
holding
in
the
crutchfield
case,
mr.
trout?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
the
question
involved
in
this
case,
but
the
question
of
the
derivation
of
the
idra.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily,
you
wouldn't
expect
the
legislative
body
that
is
enacting
a
provision
governing
a
criminal...
something
to
do
with
a
criminal
to
say,
you
know,
what
sort
of
instructions
would
be
given,
would
you?
don't
they
usually
leave
that
up
to
the
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
good
side
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
client,
but
if
we're
interested
in
giving
the
truth
a
totally...
the
jury
a
totally
truthful,
accurate
picture,
why
wouldn't
one
add
what
justice
ginsburg
said,
that
there
cold
be
a
hearing
in
40
days
and
he
might
first...
that
that
would
be
his
first
opportunity
to
be
released.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
buy
they're...
if
he
could
be
released
in
40
days,
maybe
some
of
those
fears
are
justified.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
do
you
mean,
severe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
deny
it's
possible.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
just
picking
and
choosing
the
parts
of
the
effect
of
this
verdict
that
would
make
a
jury
favor
your
client.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
trout.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
appendix
e,
starting
on
37a
of
your
brief,
there's
an
alternative
a.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
an
alternative
b.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
on
41a
we
have
alternative
a,
superior
court,
which
i
take
it
is
the
d.c.
superior
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
alternative
b,
district
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
all...
is
alternative
a
on
page
37a
and
alternative
b
on
39a
and
alternative
b
on
41a,
are
all
of
those
given
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there...
do
more
than
one
of
the
various
instructions
i've
mentioned
apply
when
the
prosecution
is
under...
is
governed
by
the
idra?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
are...
we
have
an
instruction
on
page
37a
and
an
instruction
on
page
39a
and
an
instruction
on
page
41a;
which
of
those
are
used
when
the
idra
governs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
take
a
lot
of
time
from
your
argument.
i
was
just
curious.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
what
are...
what
are
the
alternatives?
they
are
given
sometimes,
perhaps?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
trout.
ms.
wax,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
which
felt
otherwise
could
so
instruct,
i
suppose.
and
as
you
say,
the
government
could
never
raise
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
there's
an
acquittal,
and
they'd
have
no
interest
in
raising
it
if
there's
a
conviction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
wax,
the
first
question
presented
for
review
in
the...
"was
the
petitioner
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
if
he
was
found
not
guilty
solely
by
reason
of
insanity,
he
would
be
committed
until
he
was
no
longer
a
threat
to
the
safety
of
others
or
their
property.
"
don't
you
think
that
embraces
not
just
an
argument
based
entirely
on
the
statute,
but
an
argument
based
on
supervisory
power
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
the
case
is
submitted.
