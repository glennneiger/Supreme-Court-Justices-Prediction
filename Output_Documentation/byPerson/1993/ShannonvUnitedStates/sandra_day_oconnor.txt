justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
wax,
do
you
take
the
position
that
in
our
supervisory
power
we
should
insist
that
every
jury
be
told
that
they
should
not
concern
themselves
with
what
happens
to
the
defendant
following
their
verdict,
whatever
it
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
instruction
was
given
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
are
satisfied
that
it
is
always
given,
so
we
don't
have
to
concern
ourselves
with
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
any
event,
this
court
has
never
handed
down
some
decision
saying
that
it
must
be
given.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
presumably
if
that's
given,
what
additional
instruction
or
rule
is
required
by
us?
maybe...
what's
the
matter
with
just
leaving
it
there
and
letting
a
judge
decide
in
the
judge's
discretion
what
ought
to
be
done?
that's
what
we
normally
do
with
instructions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
say
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
a
trial
judge
to
give
a
truthful
instruction,
such
as
that
given
in
the
d.c.
courts,
on
what
happens
as
a...
following
a
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
verdict?
is
that
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
there
are
no
special
circumstances
and
the
trial
judge
gives
that
instruction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
a
matter
of
principle,
you
take
the
view
that's
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
give
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
wax,
all
that
we
have
to
do
in
this
case,
i
suppose,
to
satisfy
your
concern
immediately,
is
to
say
the
statute
doesn't
require
the
court
to
give
the
instruction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
have
a
case
here
where
the
judge
has
given
an
instruction
and
there's
some
objection
made,
and
perhaps
we
never
will,
but
to
decide
this
case
we
only
need
to
answer
that
one
question,
does
the
statute
require
it,
isn't
that
so?
