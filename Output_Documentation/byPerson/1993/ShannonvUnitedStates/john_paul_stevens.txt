john
paul

mr.
trout,
is
there
a...
the
d.c.
circuit
decision
you
refer
to
is
back
about
30
or
40
years
ago,
i
think,
in
the
lyles
case.
have
they
adopted
a
pattern
instruction
that
they
use,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you...
why
did
you
read
us
the
one
from
the
sixth
circuit
rather
than
that
one,
because
the
federal
government,
i
guess,
is
always
a
party
in
the
d.c.
circuit
cases.
well,
i
guess
they're
in
the
sixth
circuit
too,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
has
that
pattern
instruction
been
given,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
a
discretionary
instruction
that
the
district
judge
gives,
or
is
it
always
given
if
the
defendant
asks
for
it,
in
the
d.c.
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
trout.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
really
puzzled
by
your
argument
because
on
the
one
hand
you
ask
us
to
follow
the
example
of
the
d.c.
circuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
d.c.
circuit
pattern
instruction
has
the
40-day
provision
in
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to...
ought
to
take
one
position
or
the
other
on
whether
we
should
look
to
the
d.c.
circuit
for
guidance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
wax,
can
i
ask
you
just
kind
of
a
basic
question?
let's
assume
the
statute
doesn't
require
it,
because
there
certainly
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
a
text
should
be
given,
but
there...
the
practice
has
been
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
give
this
instruction,
as
i
understand
it,
for
some
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
asking
us
to
decide
the
case
in
a
way
that
will
require
the
d.c.
circuit
to
change
its
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that's
your
position--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
you
do
understand...
you,
in
effect,
are
saying
that
that
practice
has
been
erroneous
for
the
last
20
years
or
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
it
been
the
government's
practice
regularly
to
object
to
the
giving
of
the
instruction
in
the
district
of
columbia?
there's
probably
been
a
lot
of
these
cases,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
this
slippery
slope
in
the
district
of
columbia
caused
any
people
to
slide
downhill?
i
mean
they've
had
the
rule
there
for
over
20
years
and
we
haven't
had
all
these
other
problems,
have
we,
any
of
them?
they
don't
ask
for
instructions
on
parole
or
mandatory
minimums,
do
they?
i
mean,
it's
theoretically
possible,
but
in
practice
it
hasn't
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
"those
sorts".
one
particular
instruction
has
been
given
for
20
or
30
years
in
the
jurisdiction
without
any
evidence
of
it
creating
any
of
the
problems
that
you
hypothecate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
that's
why
he
has
a
lawyer.
if
he
doesn't
want
it,
presumably
he
can
ask
the
judge
not
to
give
it.
but
if...
when
requested,
the
question
is
whether
he's
entitled
to
it,
and
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
he
automatically
gets
it,
and
i
gather
it's
a
pattern
instruction
that
the
prosecutors
and
defense
counsel,
everybody
cooperated
in
drafting
the
particular
instruction
they
give.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
be
error
if
you
had
a
regular
rule
that
you
give
the
pattern
instruction
when
it's
asked
for.
there's
not
any
danger
of
error
there;
you
just
either...
you
just
do
it.
that's
one
of
the
beauties
of
pattern
instructions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
would
you
not
agree
that
the
d.c.
circuit's
instruction
is
accurate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
the
40
days
in
it,
and
it
has--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
raise
one
question
with
you
again.
and
forgetting
presumptions
and
hypotheticals,
what
has
the
practice
been
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
the
past
30
years?
does
the
prosecutor
ask
for
this
instruction?
and
if
so,
is
it
given?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
was
they'd
walk,
period.
