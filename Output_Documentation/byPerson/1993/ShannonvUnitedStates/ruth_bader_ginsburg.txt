but
that's
what
you're
urging
here,
are
you
not,
mr.
trout,
that
you
get
this
requirement
that
the
trial
judge
instruct
the
jury
from
the
statute?
you're
not
making
any
constitutional
argument,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you...
you're
pinning
your
position
about
what
the
judge
must
charge
to
this
idra
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
you
do...
if
you're
talking
about
just
some
general
supervisory
power
notion,
then
wouldn't
your
reasoning
apply
as
well
to
telling
the
jury
about
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
in
a
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
they'll
know
the
defendant's
exposure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
distinguish--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
distinguish
the
two,
if
it's
a
question
of
the
jury
making
an
informed
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
judge...
if
the
judge
told
the
jury,
now,
there
is
a
requirement,
if
you
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
that
this
person
go
to
mental
institutions...
a
mental
institution,
but
it
is
possible
that
he
could
be
released
within
40
days,
that
would
be...
you
would
have
no
objection
to
such
an
instruction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wouldn't
affect,
though,
the
d.c.
superior
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
there's
the
same
prosecutor
but
a
different
code.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
wax,
would...
you
are
now
urging
us
to
instate
a
supervisory
rule
that
would
go
together
with
the
idra.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
jury
sends
a
note
to
the
judge
that
says
if
we
return
an
ngi
verdict,
will
the
defendant
walk.
should
the
judge
respond
to
that,
and
if
so,
how,
under
your
supervisory
principle?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
judge
say,
no,
he
won't,
because
i'm
obliged
to
send
him
to
an
institution
where
he
will
be
examined?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
if
we
return
an
ngi
verdict,
will
the
defendant
walk.
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
you
said
that,
yes,
the
judge
could
tell...
could
respond
no
to
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
long
as
the
defense...
it's
the
defendant's
option,
why
should
we
be
concerned
about
that
aspect
of
it?
we
have
in
this
case
a
judge
who
refused
to
give
a
charge,
and
i'm
clear
on
what
your
position
is
there,
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
judge
give
the
charge.
i'm
not
clear
yet
on
your
answer
to
may
the
judge,
if
the
judge...
in
the
judge's
discretion,
give
the
charge.
say,
for
example,
the
judge
has
read
a
law
review
article
that
says
80
percent
of
jurors
don't
know
what
ngi
means;
they
think
it
means
that
the
defendant
will
walk.
and
the
judge
says,
i'm
impressed
by
that
and
i
want
to
tell
them
that
that's
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you'd
have
to
go
through
a
state
commitment,
civil
commitment.
