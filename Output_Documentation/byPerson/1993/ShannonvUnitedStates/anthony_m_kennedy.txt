justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
trial
judge
instructs
the
jury,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
are
not
to
speculate
upon
the
disposition
of
the...
or
custody
of
the
defendant
in
the
event
you
find
him
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity;
the
law
has
addressed
that
subject
and
it
is
not
your
concern.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
trial
judge
tells
the
jury
the
law
has
addressed
this
subject.
suppose
he
added
it
makes
adequate
provision
for
the
safety
of
the
public?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
anything
in
particular
in
this
case
that
might
have
led
the
jury
to
believe
that
the
defendant
would
be
release
immediately?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
not
treated
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
i
understand,
ms.
wax,
the
basis
for
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg.
you
said
well,
first,
he
could
instruct
the
jury
in
very
stern
terms
that
this
is
none
of
their
business.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
if
he
wanted,
he
could
add
the
instruction.
now,
which
is
right?
it
seems
to
me
one...
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
has
the
discretion
to
give
the
instruction,
that
must
mean
that
he
has
to
give
the
instruction
in
some
instances.
what
is
to
guide
that
discretion?
i
assume
one
factor
would
be
if
there
was
some
misleading
statement
by
counsel
to
the
effect
that
had
to
be
cured,
but
absent
that
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
is
inconsistent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
suppose
that's
the
defendant's
choice
to
make
if
he
has
the
option
to
ask
for
the
instruction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
very
odd,
ms.
wax,
that
if
you
reserve
this
instruction
for
the
jury
that
is
transgressing
its
authority,
then
they
have
the
advantage
or
the
disadvantage
of
knowing
the
extra
information.
it
seems
to
me
your
position
should
be
that
the
more
unfocused
the
jury
is
becoming,
the
more
the
judge
should
stick
to
the
letter
of
the
law
and
say,
you
must
follow
the
instructions
i
have
given
you,
these
matters
are
not
of
your
concern.
if
you
have
the
jury
ready
to
go
off
the
path,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
one
time
when
you
should
insist
on
the
instructions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
very
odd
calculus
you're
asking
us
to
accept,
that
the
one
time
we
give
this
instruction
is
when
the
jury's
about
ready
to
go
off
in
the
wrong
direction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i'm...
we're
trying
to
give
some
guidance
to
the
district
judges
as
to
what
those
circumstances
are.
