mr.
thomas
r.
trout
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
requires
the
court
to
determine
whether
and
under
what
circumstances
it
is
appropriate
for
a
trial
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
in
the
event
of
a
not
guilty
solely
by
reason
of
insanity
verdict,
that
the
accused
will
be
committed
to
a
mental
hospital.
hereafter
i
will
simply
refer
to
the
form
of
verdict
as
an
ngi
verdict.
the
case
comes
about
because
of
the
passage
by
congress
in
1984
of
the
idra,
the
insanity
defense
reform
act
of
1984.
that
act
was
passed
in
part
in
reaction
to
the
unfortunate
events
surrounding
the
assassination
attempt
of
president
reagan.
the
congress
had
been
considering
insanity
defense
reform
for
some
time
before
that,
however,
and
this
simply
was
the
event
that
pushed
the
congress
to
agreement.
prior
to
the
passage
of
that
act,
the...
there
was
no
provision
outside
the
district
of
columbia
for
the
mandatory
commitment
of
a
defendant
acquitted
in
a
federal
prosecution
because
of
insanity.
in
fact,
there
was
no
not
guilty
by
insanity
verdict,
as
such;
there
was
simply
the
general
verdicts
guilty
or
not
guilty.
the
idra
changed
that,
and
prescribed
a
form
of
verdict
which
is
not
guilty
solely
by
reason
of
insanity.
the
congress,
in
adopting
this
law,
modeled
it
closely
on
the
district
of
columbia
act
which,
of
course,
also
was
a
congressional
enactment.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
there's
no
evidence
from
the
legislative
history
that
i
can
find,
your
honor,
that
they
looked
anywhere
else.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
there's
quite
a
bit
of
evidence
that
they
did.
in
the
senate
report,
which
is
the
most
comprehensive
report
in
the
legislative
history
about
the
adoption
of
this
act,
the...
reference
to
the
d.c.
code
provisions
are
quite
numerous
and
throughout
the
report.
the
congress
in
particular
paid
close
attention
to
the
disposition
that
was
to
be
made
of
the
accused
in
the
event
he
was
found
not
guilty
solely
by
reason
of
insanity,
and
most
closely
modeled
the
idra
on
the
d.c.
enactment
with
regard
to
that
disposition.
i
think
that
is
why
it
is
so
relevant
to
the
issue
that
we
have
before
the
court
today,
because
we
are
dealing
with
what
happens
to
the
accused
in
the
event
he's
found
not
guilty
solely
by
reason
of
insanity.
the
d.c.
circuit
has
already
held
that
the
idra
was
modeled
on
d.c.
section
24-301
in
the
crutchfield
case.
the
government,
in
its
brief,
did
not
deal
with
the
crutchfield
case
whatsoever.
it
did
not
mention
it,
it
did
not
try
to
point
out
any
error
in
it,
and
i
think
it
incumbent
on
the
government
today
to
at
least
respond
to
the
crutchfield
case
and
either
admit
that
the
holding
in
that
case
is
correct
or
else
explain
to
the
court
where
the
error
in
that
case
is.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
the
holding
that
the
idra
was
closely
modeled
on
24-301.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
there
is
any
question
about
whether
the
idra
was
modeled
on
24-301,
i
think
it
important
to
point
out
the
similarities,
and
especially
with
regard
to
the
disposition
that's
to
be
made
of
the
accused
in
the
event
of
the
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
verdict.
it's
true
that
the
congress
made
certain
changes
in
the...
between
24-301
and
idra.
they
increased
the
burden
of
proof
from
preponderance
of
the
evidence
to
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
in
the
d.c.
statute
the
burden
had
been
placed
on
the
defendant
to
prove
the
defense.
they
kept
that
burden
on
him;
they
simply
increased
it
to
clear
and
convincing.
there
were
other
minor
changes
that
dealt
with
the
trial
phase
of
a
criminal
case
in
which
the
insanity
defense
is
at
issue,
and
all
of
those
changes
generally
are
to
increase
the
difficulty
on
the
accused
of
successfully
asserting
the
defense.
but
once
the
defense
is
successfully
asserted,
then
the
idra
and
24-301
are
very
very
similar.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
well,
the
lyles
case
in
1955
was
decided
under
24-301.
it
refers
to
the
statute
in
the
decision.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it's
difficult
to
think
of
congressional
enactments
which
prescribe
for
the
court
what
instructions
they
ought
to
give.
in
fact,
i...
none
come
to
my
mind.
there
may
be,
i'm
not
saying
there
are
none,
but
it
is
rare,
if
it
ever
happens,
that
congress
tells
the
courts
what
instructions
you
ought
to
give--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--no,
i'm
not
making
any
constitutional
argument.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
or
to
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
to
impose
a...
the
best
rule.
in
the
event
that
the
court
does
not
find
that
the
settled
judicial
construction
of
24-301
was,
in
fact,
incorporated
into
the
idra,
then
the
court
still
has
the
power
to
require
the
instruction.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
no.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
the
diff...
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
but--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--well,
the
difference
is
this.
the
jury
has
no
role
in
sentencing
and
i'm
not
here
to
create
some...
urge
some
doctrine
that
would
give
the
jury
a
role
in
sentencing
unless
the
legislature
does
it
by
some
congressional
enactment.
the
only
point
that
i'm
advocating
for
is
that
the
jury
have
the
same
knowledge
about
the
insanity
defense,
the
same
common
knowledge
that
it
has
about
guilty
and
not
guilty
verdicts.
jurors
come
into
the
courtroom
knowing
that
not
guilty
verdicts
mean
the
accused
will
be
free
if
such
a
verdict
is
rendered.
they
also
know
that
if
they
render
a
guilty
verdict,
he
is
at
least
subject
to
punishment,
but...
they
don't
know
necessarily
what
that
punishment
will
be
but
they
do
know
he
can
be
punished.
with
regard
to
the
not
guilty
solely
by
reason
of
insanity
verdict,
there
is
no
certainty
about
what
will
happened
to
an
uninformed
layman.
he
or
she
simply
knows
that
the
verdict
says
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
and
what
happens
to
the
defendant
thereafter
the
jury
has
no
idea
about.
and
quite
frequently
we
are
dealing
with
accused
who
are
violent
and
at
least...
at
the
very
least
are
disturbed
mentally,
and
the
public
is
concerned
both
about
violent
individuals
and
mentally
disturbed
individuals.
and
jurors
may
well
feel
compelled
to
convict
under
circumstances
where
they
would
otherwise
feel
that
the
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
verdict
was
proper
simply
in
order
to
prevent
the
release
of
someone
that
they
see
as
potentially
dangerous
to
the
public.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
well,
i
think
that
instruction
is...
i
do
object
to
that
instruction,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
it
solves
the
problem
that
i
am
urging
the
court
to
correct.
i
think
the
instruction
ought
to
be
brief
and
it
ought
to
be
concise,
but
it
should
simply
say
something
like
what
the
sixth
circuit
pattern
instruction
says,
which
is:
"if
you
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
because
of
insanity,
then
it
will
be
my
duty
to
send
him
to
a
suitable
institution.
"
"he
will
only
be
released
from
custody
if
he
proves
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
his
release
would
not
create
a
substantial
risk
that
he
might
injure
someone
or
seriously
damage
someone's
property.
"
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
mr.
chief
justice,
we're
not
trying
to
get
the
jury...
i'm
not
trying
to
get
the
jury
involved
in
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
man
down
the
road...
or
woman...
other
than
to
say,
other
than
to
assuage
whatever
fears
they
have
that
they're
going
to
release
this
man.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
mr.
chief
justice,
the
act
is
so
severe
that--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--i
mean
severe
with
regard
to
the
ability
of
an
accused
found
not
guilty
solely
by
reason
of
insanity
to
be
released.
it
is
very
restrictive,
and
it's
very
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
in
many
cases
for
anyone
who
successfully
asserts
this
defense
to
subsequently
obtain
release.
so--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--it's
possible.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
your
honor,
i...
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
honor
the
time
honored
principle
that
the
jury
has
no
role
in
the
disposition
of
the
accused,
at
the
same
time
that
the
jury
is
put
on
an
equal
footing
that
they're
already
on
with
regard
to
the
guilty
and
not
guilty
verdicts.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
wise
to
have
the
jury
speculate
about
whether
the
man
will
be
released
or
not
be
released.
they
may
do
it
anyway,
but
this
instruction
will...
it
will
solve
some
of
the
problems
that
the
present
situation
creates.
and
there...
i
don't
suggest
that
there's
any
ideal
solution
to
it,
but
i
do
believe
it
would
be
unwise
to
get
into
the
detail
about
what
happens,
because...
when
i
say
what
happens,
what
happens
in
the
event
of
his
acquittal
on
this
ground
and
the
subsequent
commitment
procedures
and
release
procedures.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
your
honor,
i
did
include
the
d.c.
circuit
pattern
instruction
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
and--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--it's...
i've
got
two
of
them,
both
of
them
in
here.
it's
been
amended
slightly,
but
it's
been
in
effect
since...
roughly
since
the
brawner
case
in
1972.
and
so
the
instruction
is
of
long
standing
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
and
it
was
in
effect--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--in
the
d.c.
circuit
it
is
always
given
if
the
defendant
asks
for
it,
but
if
the
defendant
does
not
want
the
instruction
given,
it
is
not
given.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
well,
similar
instructions
are
given,
justice
kennedy,
i...
in
every
case,
i
believe.
but
i
don't
think
that's...
i
realize
the
presumption
is
that
juries
follow
their
instructions,
and
that
is
necessarily
a
presumption
that
we
have
to
engage
in
in
order
for
the
criminal
justice
system
to
work.
but,
to
simply
give
them
that
instruction
with
all
the
fear
and
concern
that
jurors
may
feel
about
the
accused
in
these
cases
is
expecting
too
much.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
well,
i
think
that
surveys
indicate...
many
surveys
do
indicate
that
the
public
at
large
is
very
suspicious
of
the
insanity
verdict.
they
feel
like
it's
used
all
the
time
and
it's
very
successful
and
it's
a
loophole
that
criminals
use
to
get
through
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
well,
i
think
it
has
to
be
wrong.
your
honor,
under
the
idra,
but--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--justice
scalia,
the
reason
to
give
the
instruction,
as
i
see
it,
is
to
have
the
jury
concentrate
on
the
law
and
the
evidence
in
the
case,
and
to...
and
to
bring
in
the
40-day
requirement
is
a...
there
is
some
danger.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
well,
i
think
i
have
it
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
that
if
the...
the
doctrine
that
i
am
asking
the
court
to
follow
is
the
incorporation
of
the
settled
judicial
construction
which
was
placed
on
the
d.c.
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
no,
sir,
i
did
not
acknowledge
that.
it
was
very
settled--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--no,
sir,
but
it
is
a...
it's
a
settled
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
every
decision
is
tied
to
the
statute.
now,
they're
not
construing
a
word
or
a
phrase
in
the
statute,
i
confess
that,
but
it
is
tied
to
the
statute
and
congress
knew
that.
when
it
adopted
the
idra
it
knew
the
practice,
and
it...
in
fact,
in
the
senate
report
it
advocates
the
practice
of
the
instruction.
and
i
will...
i
must
confess
that
a
strict
application
of
the
doctrine
of
incorporation
that
i'm
asking
the
court
to
adopt
would
require
the
model
instruction
that
justice
stevens
has
referred
to.
i
don't...
i
personally
don't
think
it
is
the
best
instruction,
but
it
is
the
instruction
which
the
d.c.
circuit
has
used
now
for...
well,
in
its
form,
i
believe,
for
over
20
years,
and
it
would
certainly
be
a
substantial
improvement
over
the
present
situation.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
for
that...
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
just
putting
it
there
without
explanation.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
some
of
the
cases
are
going
to
be
prosecuted
under
24-301,
some
of
them
are
going
to
be
prosecuted
under
idra,
and
so
that's
part
of
the
reason
for
the
alternatives,
because
the
terms
of
the
statutes
are
slightly
different
so
the--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
i
have
to
stop
a
minute,
your
honor,
and
remember.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
all
right.
the
instruction
that
is
most
important
is
the
instruction
5.11:
"effect
of
a
finding
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
"
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
that's
on
page
36a.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
well,
no,
they
define
the...
they
define
insanity
and
give
the
substantive
nature
of
the
defense.
the
5.11
on
36a
simply
gives
a
short
instruction
that
informs
the
jury
about
the
disposition
that
will
be
made
of
the
accused
in
the
event
that
he's
found
not
guilty
solely
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
it's
different
because
in
that
case
that
you
pose,
the
defendant
is
on
trial
for
a
crime,
and
the
jury
knows
that
if
they
convict
him
he
is
subject
to
punishment,
and
that's
all
they...
that's
all
they
need
to
know.
and--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--it's
important
in
the
insanity
context
simply
because
they...
there's
a
void
there
and
they
don't
have
any
knowledge,
or
they
may
not
have
any
knowledge,
or
they
may
have
erroneous
knowledge.
but
in
the
case
that
you
pose,
they
have
some
knowledge,
they
have
all
the
knowledge
they
need
to
render
a
true
verdict,
which
is
that
the
defendant
is
subject
to
punishment.
and
that's
all
they
need
to
know,
and
that's
all
the
law
has
traditionally
permitted
them
to
know,
and
i
don't
argue
with
that.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
rule
that
i'm
asking
the
court
to
adopt
will
interfere
or
weaken
that
principle
in
any
way.
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
your
honor,
there
was
nothing
in
the
case
that--
mr.
thomas
r.
trout
--there
was
nothing
in
the
case
that
would
have
caused
them
to
believe
that.
it
was
not
mentioned
in
any
way.
nevertheless,
the
insanity
verdict
was
something
that
the
jury
was
concerned
about.
they
sent
a
note
back
to
the
court
during
their
deliberations,
which
is
on
page
a-9
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
saying:
"we
want
you
to
explain
the
reason
of
insanity.
"
now,
that
note
does
not
mean,
necessarily,
anything.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
it
meant,
and
the
court
didn't
either.
but
it
could
mean
we
want
you
to
explain
what
caused
this
man's
insanity,
we
want
you
to
explain
what
the
reason
of
this
defense
is.
really,
the
note
is
quite
ambiguous
and
subject
to
a
number
of
interpretations.
