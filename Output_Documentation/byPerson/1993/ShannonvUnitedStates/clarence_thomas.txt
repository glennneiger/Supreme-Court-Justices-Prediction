the
second
decision
i
have
today
is
no.
92-8346,
shannon
versus
the
united
states.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
the
insanity
defense
reform
act
of
1984,
congress
created
a
special
verdict
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
or
ngi,
and
established
a
commitment
procedure
for
those
defendants
found
ngi.
at
his
federal
criminal
trial,
petitioner,
shannon,
raised
the
ngi
defense
and
asked
the
district
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
he
would
be
involuntarily
committed
if
the
jury
found
or
returned
an
ngi
verdict.
the
district
court
refused
shannon's
request
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
that
because
there
was
no
directive
in
the
idra
to
the
contrary
it
would
adhere
to
the
principle
that
a
jury
is
not
to
be
informed
of
the
consequences
of
its
verdict.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
like
the
court
of
appeals,
we
conclude
that
nothing
in
the
idra
requires
courts
to
depart
from
their
well-established
principle
that
a
jury
is
not
to
be
informed
of
the
consequences
of
its
verdict.
we
reject
shannon's
assertion
that
congress,
by
modeling
the
idra
on
a
district
of
columbia
code
provision,
impliedly
adapted
a
decision
of
the
dc
circuit
court
of
appeals
endorsing
the
instructions
shannon
now
seeks.
the
canon
of
statutory
construction
upon
which
shannon
relies
that
congress
when
it
adapts
statutory
language
from
another
jurisdiction,
also
adapts
that
jurisdiction's
judicial
interpretation
of
the
language
as
inapplicable
in
this
case
as
congress
departed
from
the
dc
circuit
provision
in
several
significant
ways.
we
also
decline
to
place
authoritative
weight
on
a
passage
of
legislative
history
endorsing
the
instruction
as
that
passage
is
in
no
way
anchored
in
the
tax
of
the
statute.
finally,
we
reject
shannon's
alternative
argument
that
the
instruction
should
be
given
as
a
matter
of
general
federal
criminal
practice.
shannon
contends
the
instruction
as
necessary
because
jurors
may
be
unwilling
to
return
an
ngi
verdict
based
on
an
erroneous
belief
that
a
defendant
found
ngi
will
be
immediately
released
into
society.
like
most
federal
juries,
however,
the
jury
in
shannon's
case
was
instructed
to
apply
the
law
regardless
of
the
consequences.
we
see
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
assumption
that
jurors
follow
their
instructions.
although
we
recognize
that
an
instruction
of
some
form
maybe
necessary
under
certain
limited
circumstances
to
remedy
a
misstatement
by
witness
or
prosecutor.
no
such
misstatement
was
made
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
during
shannon's
trial.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
