justice

was
it
the
case
that
the
d.c.
courts
that
imposed
this
requirement
under
the
idra
purported
to
be
imposing
it
because
the
statute
required
it,
or
was
it
simply
a
part
of
their
own
supervision
of
the
d.c.
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
say
that
this
requirement
of
informing
a
jury
is
a
statutory
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that's
wrong
and
that
a
particular
position
should
be
taken
in
telling
the
jury
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
the
public
may
think
that
people
at
the
40-day
hearing
are
simply
judged
too
leniently
and
that
therefore
they
get
out
after
40
days
when
they
shouldn't
get
out
after
40
days.
must
the
court
take
a
position
on
whether
the
system
is,
indeed,
operating
well
enough?
if
the
public
wants
to
think,
if
the
jury
wants
to
think
that,
in
fact,
they're
letting
them
out
too
soon,
must
the
court
disabuse
them
of
that
notion
by
withholding
from
them
the
information
that
this
person
could
be
out
within
40
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
said
it
wasn't.
you
said
it
wasn't
a
settled
construction
of
the
statute,
i
thought
you
acknowledged
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
trout,
if
i
didn't
agree
with
you
as
to
whether
this
requirement
is
brought
along
by
the
statute,
if
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
but
i
do
think
that
there's
a
question
as
to
what
the
federal
courts
should
provide
under
their
supervisory
power
and
if
i
think
that
they
should
provide
this
instruction,
why
shouldn't
i
think
that
they
would
also
have
to
provide
the
instruction,
for
example,
in
a
case
where
there
have
been
multiple
crimes
committed
by
a
particular
individual
and
he's
been
convicted
of
one
of
them
already?
must
the
jury
know
that
this
person
is
already
under
life
sentence,
so
that
if
you
find
him
not
guilty
of
this
subsequent
crime,
it
really
doesn't
matter?
why
is
that
any
different
from
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
they
should
also
know
that
if
they
release
him,
he's
not
going
to
be
turned
loose
on
the
public.
you
say
that's
very
important
for
them
to
know;
why
shouldn't
they
know
that
in
this
other
case
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let
me--
--but
there
is
not
an
inaccurate
notion.
what
gave
you
the
impression
there's
an
inaccurate
notion?
the
jury
just
doesn't
know,
but
that's
the
same
presumed
state
of
facts
even
before
they
asked
the
question.
the
jury
doesn't
know
what
the
effect
of
a
dwi
instruction
is;
that's
all
the
question
indicates.
it
doesn't
indicate
that
they're
under
a
misimpression
at
all,
but
just
indicates
we
don't
know
what
happens
if
we
come
in
with
dwi.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
you
say
you
can
give
the
instruction
when
they
come
in
with
a
question,
you
ought
to
say
you
can
give
the
instruction
even
if
they
don't
come
in
with
a
question.
they
ought
to
know
what
dwi
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
ginsburg
did
not
say
that
the
question
was
if
we
return
a
dwi
verdict,
the
defendant
will
walk,
won't
he.
that's
a
different
question,
and
then
i
could
understand
your
response,
but
if
all
they
ask
is
what
will
happen,
will
he
walk,
i
don't
see
that
that's
any
impression.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
a
jury
in
a
criminal
case
that
has
a
number
of
counts,
first
degree
murder,
second
degree
murder,
manslaughter;
there's
some
indication
that
the
jury
thinks
that
manslaughter,
the
punishment
for
manslaughter
is
that
you're
going
to
lose
your
driving...
driver's
license;
must
that
be
corrected?
does
the
jury
have
to
know
what
the
increment
of
punishment
is
for
each
of
the
verdicts
that
it's
going
to
bring
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
no
idea
what
the
consequences
of
first
degree
versus
second
degree
versus
manslaughter,
we
have
no
idea
what
the
consequences
are,
please
tell
us
how
long
does
this
person
spend
in
prison,
if
any
time
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
must
the
court
respond
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
a
court
must,
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
that's
different
from
this
case.
i
don't
think
a
court
must.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wax,
i
suppose
you
have
to
be
a
pretty
stupid
jury
to
think
that
you're
given
three
choices,
guilty,
not
guilty,
or
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
and
to
think
that
the
last
two
have
exactly
the
same
consequences.
it's
sort
of,
you
know,
this
is
my
brother
daryl,
this
is
my
other
brother
daryl.
[laughter]
it's
ridiculous.
isn't
it
ridiculous?
well,
it
may
be
ridiculous,
but
that
was,
in
fact,
the
practice
in
the
federal
system
for
a
long
long
time,
wasn't
it?
