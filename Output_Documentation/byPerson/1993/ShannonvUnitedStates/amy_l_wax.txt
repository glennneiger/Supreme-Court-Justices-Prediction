ms.
amy
l.
wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
principal
contention
in
this
case
is
that
it
was
error
for
the
judge
not
to
instruct
the
jury
on
the
consequences
of
an
insanity
verdict
because
that
instruction
is
required
by
the
text
of
the
insanity
defense
reform
act
of
1984.
as
a
simple
matter
of
statutory
construction,
that
contention
must
be
incorrect.
the
insanity
defense
reform
act
does
expressly
deal
with
instruction
to
the
jury.
it
requires
the
jury
to
be
instructed
that
it
can
find
the
defendant
guilty,
not
guilty,
or
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
in
a
case
in
which
the
insanity
defense
has
been
raised,
but
it
is
absolutely
silent
concerning
instructions
on
the
consequences
of
an
insanity
verdict.
now,
petitioner
seeks
to
rely
on
the
familiar
canon
of
statutory
construction
that
where
congress
has
adopted
a
statute
enacted
in
another
jurisdiction
and
that
statute
has
received
a
settled
judicial
interpretation,
congress
must
be
deemed
to
have
adopted
that
settled
interpretation
along
with
the
text.
now,
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
canon
of
construction
does
not
help
petitioner
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
canon
does
not
even
apply
here
for
the
simple
reason,
as
justice
scalia
and
justice
souter
have
pointed
out,
that
the
d.c.
circuit,
in
laying
down
the
mandatory
rule
of
instruction
in
lyles,
was
not
engaging
in
interpretation
of
the
d.c.
statute.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
are
asking
this
court
to
lay
down
a
supervisory
principle,
just
setting
aside
the
whole
issue
of
statutory
construction.
we
are
recommending
that
this
court,
in
its
supervisory
capacity,
adopt
the
principle
that
in
general
the
instruction
should
not
be
given
except
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
where
there
is
affirmative
indication
that
the
jury
has
been
misled
or
misunderstands
the
consequences
of
the
verdict
and
may
be
influenced.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
so,
in
a
way
i'm
saying,
yes,
we
are
asking--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--as
a
rigid,
inflexible,
blanket
rule,
yes,
but
not
as
a
matter
of
instruction.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
that
we
haven't
consistently
objected,
we've
just
gone
along
with
the
rule
in
d.c.
and
it's
important
to
realize--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--no.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
exactly.
the
reason
why
the
d.c.
circuit
has
this
rule
as
a
rule
applying
to
the
d.c.
code
is
that
until
1973
the
d.c.
circuit
was
the
appellate
court
for
d.c.
law
as
well
as
federal
law,
and
then
there
was
a
split.
and,
of
course,
this
just
goes
to
the
point
of
whether
this
is
a
supervisory
rule.
it
was
a
supervisory
rule
adopted
by
the
d.c.
circuit
to
apply
to
any
insanity
defense
within
its
jurisdiction,
whatever
law
it
may
have
arisen
under.
of
course--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--with
federal--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i
think
under
those
circumstances
the
judge
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
jury
was
tempted
to
abandon
its
responsibility
or
its
oath,
that
their...
that
the
system,
so
to
speak,
was
not
functioning
properly;
that
the
jury
was
focused
on
something
that
they
weren't
supposed
to
be
focused
on,
even
to
the
point
where
they
may
harbor
a
misconception
about
what
would
happen.
and
that
might
be
the
type
of
circumstance
in
which
the
judge
should
at
least
instruct
the
jury,
again
quite
sternly,
that
this
was
none
of
their
concern,
but
could
perhaps
go
beyond
that
and
issue
a
curative
instruction
to
perhaps
clear
up
any
possible
misconception
about
the
disposition.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
he
could.
i
mean,
he
could...
he
could,
in
effect,
issue
a
curative
instruction
that
included
the
information
about
what
would
happen
to
the
particular
defendant.
i
think
there
are
other--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
no,
if
the
jury
says
will
the
defendant
walk,
will
he
be
instantly
released,
that...
i
think
the
judge
can
think
that
that's
somehow
equivalent
to
a
prosecutor
making
the
statement,
and,
by
the
way,
this
defendant's
going
to
walk,
because
it
means
that
there
is
this
notion
in
their
mind
which
is
inaccurate.
when
there's
an
inaccurate
notion
in
the
mind
of
the
jury,
it
is
our
belief
that
the
judge
need
not
just
sternly
admonish
them
to
ignore
the
consequences,
but
can
actually
correct
that
misinformation.
i'll
give
another
example--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
my
understanding
from
justice
ginsburg's
question...
and
maybe
i
misheard
it...
is
that
they
actually
asked,
will
this
individual
be
instantly
freed,
implying
that
they
had
a
misimpression
because,
in
fact,
he's
not
going
to
be
instantly
freed
necessarily.
let
me
just
give
an
analogous
example--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
let
me
give
an--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
no,
he--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
now
we're
getting
into
subtleties.
let
me
try
and
give
an
analogous
example.
i
think
that
my
response
is
in
part
a
function
of
the
great
deal
of
discretion
that
we
give
judges,
district
court
judges
in
issuing
curative
instructions,
instructions
which
try
to
correct
misimpressions
on
the
part
of
juries.
i
mean,
if
a
statement
came
out
in
the
trial
about
prior
convictions;
if,
for
example,
a
prosecutor
tried
to
insinuate
than
an
individual
had
prior
convictions
in
a
particular
case,
and
it
turned
out
he
had
no
prior
convictions,
i
mean
that
was
actually
false,
we...
i
don't
believe
that
the
judge
would
be
confined
to
just
simply
saying
ignore
that
comment
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
but
he
could
go
on
from
there
and
actually
give
the
proper
information,
correct
the
misinformation.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
it
probably
isn't
necessary
to
insist
on
it,
since
i
believe
that
it
is
generally
practice
in
most
federal
jurisdictions,
at
least
it
was--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes,
it
was,
on
page
a-8
of
the
joint
appendix.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i'm
not
going
to
say
with
absolute
certainty
that
it's
always
given,
because
i
haven't
reviewed
the
instructions
of
each
circuit,
but--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--not
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
we
do
think
that
the
judge
should
have
a
great
deal
of
discretion,
but
we
also
believe
that
there
can
be
such
a
think
as
abuse
of
discretion
in
this
instance.
and
the
reason
that
we
think
that
the
judge
should
not
be
allowed
to
give
information
to
the
jury
generally
about
consequences
of
the
ngi
verdict
unless
there's
some
affirmative
indication
that
the
system
is
not
functioning,
is
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--there
are
other
instances
in
which
the
judge
could
equally
be
allowed
discretion
to
give
instructions
about
mandatory
minimums--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
ever
come
to
appeal,
necessarily,
but
i
think
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
judge
should
not
be
doing
that,
and--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--exactly.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
exactly.
so
when
i
say
that
i
don't
think
it
would
ever
come
to
appeal,
that's
precisely
what
i'm
saying.
it's
sort
of
a
theoretical
principle,
and
i
don't--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i
think
it
would
be...
i
think
this
court
should
indicate
that
it
would
be
improper
because
it
would
not
be
in
keeping
with
the
general
principles
that
govern
our
system,
which
is
that
we
don't
ordinarily
have
trial
judges
instructing
juries
about
consequences
of
verdicts,
not
just
in
the
insanity
context
but
in
a
million
other
contexts
in
which
the
jury
could
well
be
interested
in
what's
going
to
happen,
could
well
be
interested
in
probation,
issues
of
parole,
mandatory
minimum-maximum
sentences,
whether
they
can
make
a
recommendation
of
leniency
as
the
rogers
case
exemplifies.
i
mean,
the
fact
is
we're
on
a
slippery
slope
once
we
sanction
these
sorts
of
freewheeling--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
no.
but,
first
of
all,
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
different
matter
if
this
court
sanctioned
those
sorts
of
instructions
and
the
reasoning
behind
them--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--but,
your
honor,
there's
really
no
way
to
distinguish
between
that
sort
of
instruction
which
opens
the
door
to
the
jury
speculating
about
the
consequences
of
the
verdict...
and
it's
not
as
if
this
doesn't
come
at
a
price.
i
mean,
petitioner
tries
to
imply
that
this
instruction
can
only
help
the
defendant,
and
that's
just
not
true.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
it's
just
our
view
that
this
is
not
a
necessary
rule,
and
in
that
sense
we
shouldn't
have
the
rule,
which
is
just
another
opportunity
for
error
on
the
part
of
the
judge;
that
it's
not
a
desireable
rule--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
the
problem
is,
of
course...
well,
let
me
just
say
that
the
instruction
that
petitioner
wants,
the
instruction
that
he's
requesting,
is
not
really
a
terribly
accurate
or
helpful
instruction.
he
is
focusing--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--it
is
accurate,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
it
does,
but
our
position
is
that
any
jury
that
is
going
to
be...
is
going
to
be
swayed
by
its
fear
of
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
defendant
instead
of
adhering
to
its
oath
and
looking
only
to
evidence
is
not
going
to
be
influenced
by
this
instruction
because
this
instruction
provides
no...
very
little
reassurance
to
any
jury
that
an
individual
who
might
be
dangerous
is
not
going
to
be
released.
a
person
will,
at
most,
be
held
for
40
days,
and,
in
fact,
he
could
be
sprung
as
little
as
a
few
days
after
the
verdict
because
the
hearing
can
be
held
at
any
time
within
40
days,
and
the
person
needs
to
show
that
he
isn't
going
to
be
dangerous
to
others
and
the
property
of
others,
but
that
is
a
very
different
matter
from
a
showing
that
needs
to
be
made
to
succeed
in
an
insanity
verdict,
which
is--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--but
it's
this
court's
responsibility
to
decide
whether,
in
fact,
it
makes
any
sense
to
add
yet
another
requirement,
another
instruction,
when
that
instruction
is
out
of
keeping
with
the
general...
our
paradigm,
which
is
that
juries
look
to
the
evidence,
and
is
just
of
marginal
utility
and
in
some
cases
may
backfire.
i
mean,
we
haven't
talked
at
all
about
the
ways
in
which
this
sort
of
information
might
lead
to...
the
jury
to
engage
in
compromise
verdicts.
there
are
all
kinds
of
situations
in
which
the
jury's
attention
being
brought
to
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
defendant
might
lead
them
to
render
a
less
rather
than
a
more
accurate
verdict.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
mean,
that
law
review
article
has
yet
to
be
produced.
maybe
at
some
point
in
the
future
it
might
be
produced
and
the
land...
the
whole
landscape
that
surrounds
this
particular
issue
will
change.
but
one
of
the
pieces
of
information
on
which
we
base
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
there
simply
is
no
good
evidence;
it's
purely
speculative
that
jurors
systematically
misunderstand
the
law.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right,
that
is
one...
certainly
one--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that's
certainly
correct
based
on
the
argument
that
petitioner
has
made,
but
we
have
made
the
additional
argument
and
we
think
that
guidance
might
be
useful,
although
certainly
not
mandatory.
it
might
be
useful
for
this
court
to
lay
down
certain
guidance
for
the
lower
courts
to
follow,
certain
parameters.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
certainly
can,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
we
have
made
a
separate
argument
both
in
our
brief
and
are
attempting
to
make
one
here,
which
is
that
certainly
even
if
the
statute
doesn't
require
this
instruction...
and
certainly
it
doesn't
require
it...
that
there
still
is
a
further
question
of
whether,
as
a
supervisory
matter,
this
court
ought
to
have
a
certain
rule
about
what
lower
courts
should
do.
and
i
think
that
the
lyles
case
exemplifies
a
court
of
appeals
deciding,
you
know,
what
ought
to
be
the
practice
in
its
jurisdiction.
and
as
a--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes,
under
appropriate
circumstances.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i'm
having
trouble
thinking
of
one...
i'm
having
trouble
thinking
of
circumstances.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
under
our...
under
our
theory,
i
don't
think
the
prosecutor
would
be
entitled
to
the
instruction.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
because
our
view
is
that
in
the
absence
of
a
particular
indication
that
this
jury,
in
this
case--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--no.
that
would
be
our
view.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
if
there...
our
view
is
that
we
presume
that
the
system
is
functioning
properly
in
the
sense
that
the
jury--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
no,
that's
a
particularized
set
of
circumstances.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
think...
i
wouldn't
say
no
to
that.
if
would
have
to
be,
though--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
very
different
from
this
case,
and
i
haven't
really
thought
through
what
the
state
would
be
entitled
to.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yeah.
because
i
think
one
of
the
premises
of
this
case
is
that
the
defendant
is...
it
is
the
defendant
who
is,
in
effect,
making,
without
making
it,
a
sort
of
quasi
due
process
argument
that
it's
essential
to
the
protection
of
their
interest.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
well,
i
think
if
there's
been
an
affirmative
breakdown
and
indication
that
the
jury
has
really
gone
astray,
i
think
probably
the
prosecutor
could
get
such
an
instruction.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
you
mean,
if
the
jury
says...
sends
back
a
note
and
says
we
want
to
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
person's
driver's
license.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yeah,
we're
very
concerned
about
this
person's
driver's
license.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
okay.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
well,
once
again,
i
would
distinguish,
justice
scalia,
between
a
case
in
which
the
jury
has
expressed
a
sort
of
vague
concern
with
consequences
and
a
case--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i
think
a
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
once
again,
your
honor,
it
really
depends
on
the
circumstances,
as
with
all
curative
instructions,
as
with
all
cases
in
which--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--as
in
all
cases
where
juries
send
back
notes
asking
specific
questions
or
saying
we're
concerned
about
this
and
they're
not
supposed
to
be
concerned,
or
we
harbor
this
misconception
that
just
simply
isn't
true,
the
judge
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
judgment
about
how
much
they
need
to
tell
the
jury
to
get
them
back
on
track.
and
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
lay
down
a
blanket
rule
except
to
say
that
the
presumption
of
regularity
has
to
apply
in
general.
despite,
you
know,
law
review
articles
or
background
information,
the
presumption
that
the
jury
will
stick
to
the
evidence
will
apply.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
practice
has
been
that
the
instruction
is
given
unless
the
defendant
objects.
that's
my
understanding.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
it's
given
as
a
matter
of
course
unless
the
defendant
actually
objects
to
the
instruction
being
given.
and
that's--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
as
a
formality--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--not
in
reality.
in
reality...
it
was
only
formally,
but
not
in
reality,
and
justice
scalia--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that's
right,
you
had
to
give
the
defendant
over
to
the
state.
but,
in
fact,
the
federal
system
tried
very
hard
to
ensure
that
those
procedures
took
place
and
a
fair
number
of
people
were
committed.
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
people
didn't
know,
and
especially
after
the
hinckley
verdict
in
1982,
that
people
somehow
think
that
individuals
who
are
acquitted
by
reason
of
insanity
are
instantly
released.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
and,
beyond
that,
that
even
if
some
of
them
do
think
that,
that
they're
going
to
act
on
that
belief.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
