justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rosenthal,
you
seem
to
acknowledge,
then,
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
ash
may
contain
material
that
under
the
ordinary
definition
would
be
considered
hazardous
waste.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
you
explain
the
scope
of
your
position?
you
represent
the
city
which
operates
its
own
resource
recovery
facility.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
does
it
do
with
the
ash
at
the
end
of
the
day?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
landfill
is
out
of
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
owned
or
operated
by
the
city.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
private
landfill.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statutes
mean
that
there
is
an
exemption
all
the
way
down
the
line,
even
in
the
private
landfill
and
with
regard
to
what
the
owner
of
the
private
landfill
does
with
the
ash?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
ask
that
because
the
statute,
6921,
refers
to
the
exclusion
for
the
resource
recovery
facility,
and
what
it
does
in
treating,
storing,
disposing,
or
otherwise
managing
the
waste,
and
so
do
you
think
it's
clear
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
that
the
exemption
extends
to
down
the
line
private
landfills?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
i
understood
it,
you
make
a
plain
language
argument,
and
i
just
wondered
what
the
plain
language
was
that
you
thought
covered
the
private
landfill.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
rosenthal,
from
'85
to
'92,
was
the
official
position
of
the
epa
to
the
effect
that
the
ash
was
subject
to
subtitle
c
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
your
answer
yes,
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
happened
during
that
interval?
did
they
enforce
subtitle
c?
did
the
city
comply
with
subtitle
c?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
minear,
i'm
troubled,
still,
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
that
we
are
asked
to
interpret
deals
with
what
we
do
with
a
resource
recovery
facility
and
what
conduct
of
that
facility
is
exempt
from
subtitle
c--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
epa
memorandum
seems
to
be
addressed
more
to
whether
ash
itself
should
be
treated
as
a
hazardous
waste,
which
presumably
would
take
it
all
the
way
down
the
line,
and
i'm
having
some
difficulty
with
understanding
how
we
interpret
the
statute
as
applied,
ultimately,
to
the
private
landfill.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
when
it's
in
the
landfill?
maybe
it
covers
the
city...
the
resource
recovery
facility
until
it
dumps
it
out
on
the
ground,
but
then
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
to
decide
that
here?
i
mean,
i
guess
we
don't
have
the
landfill
before
us.
we
have
the
resource
recovery
facility.
how
much
do
we
have
to
decide
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
you
say
the
cost
estimates
if
we
agree
with
petitioner
are
incorrect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
we
have
in
the
record
to
clarify
that
for
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
epa
need
to
promulgate
a
rule
if
it
decides
not
to
regulate
something?
