justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
you
wouldn't
be
deeming
it
to
dispose
of
hazardous
waste
because
it
was
disposing
of
hazardous
waste.
you
don't
have
to
deem
a
darn
thing.
what
the
statute
is
saying
is
that
at
least
at
a
certain
stage
they
shall
not
be
deemed.
the
statute
is
written
in
such
a
way
as
to
say,
don't
treat
them
as
if
they
are
doing
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
may
be
a
period
of
uncertainty
as
to
when
one
regime
ends
and
another
begins,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
this
as
defining
the
ash
as
nonhazardous
waste
as
opposed
to
directing
that
the
recovery
facility
shall
not
deemed
to
be
dealing
with
it,
and
if
you
do
not
read
this...
and
in
its
plain
language
it
is
not
a
definition
of
hazardous
waste,
nor
is
it
a
provision
saying
ash
is
not,
then
at
most,
it
seems
to
me,
you
can
get
by
plain
language
is
that
you
don't
treat
the
ash
as
hazardous
waste
until
it
leaves
the
hands
of
the
recovery
facility,
but
at
that
point,
i
don't
see
how
anything
in
this
statute
by
its
terms
covers
the
ash.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
you
say
congress
explicitly
put
into
it.
was...
i
don't
have
the
text
of
the
prior
epa
reg
in
front
of
me.
was
the
epa
reg
a
deemer
clause
which
referred
to
the
resource
recovery
facility
as
not
being
deemed
to
be
dealing
in
hazardous
waste?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe...
congress
sometimes
engages
in
the
use
of
euphemism,
and
if
in
fact
what
congress
did
was
to
come
up
with
a
text
which
was
in
some
significant
way
different
from
what
it
purported
to
be
clarifying,
we've
got
to
give
some
significance
to
the
text,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
big
significance
is,
epa
said,
ash
isn't
hazardous.
don't
treat
it
that
way.
congress
is
saying,
when
a
recovery
facility
is
doing
certain
things,
it
will
not
be
deemed
to
be...
i.e.,
pretend
it's
not...
dealing
with
hazardous
waste.
that's
a
very
different
provision.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
which
word,
the
word
of
the
text,
or
the
word
of
the
title?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
we
find
that
the
plain
language
of
the
text
is
less
a
clarification
than
a
modification?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
rosenthal,
even
on
the
least
generous
view
of
eda's
position,
the
statute
is
not
completely
useless,
is
it,
because
it
does
clarify
the
significance
of
receiving
nonhazardous
industrial
waste?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean,
it
was
already
exempt
even
if
it
included
both
household
and
industrial
nonhazardous?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
minear,
with
respect
to
the
question
whether
the
ash
stream
itself
is
exempt
for
as
far
as
it
may
go,
would
you
explain
to
me
by
reference
to
the
text
of
the
statute
what
is
ambiguous
about
it?
the
parties
disagree,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
make
an
ambiguity,
and
what
in
the
text
is
ambiguous
about
the
question
whether
the
ash
stream
is
or
is
not
forever
exempt?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that
ambiguity
goes
to
the
question
of
what
resource
recovery
facility
is
covered.
how
does
that
ambiguity
affect
the
question
whether
the
ash
stream
which
is
generated
by
whatever
recovery
facility
generates
it
is
forever
exempt?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
let's...
i'm
worried...
i'm
concerned
about
not
the
problem
of
where
the
exemption
stops
and
starts
within
the
facility,
if
you
will,
i'm
concerned
with
whether
there
is
an
exemption
that
survives
the
point
at
which
the
ash
leaves
the
facility
and
goes
to
a
landfill,
and
as
to
that,
which
raises
the
question
whether
the
ash
is
exempt
or
the
facility
is
exempt,
as
to
that,
where
is
the
ambiguity?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
silent,
isn't
it,
in
the
sense
that
it
doesn't
talk
about
ash,
it
just
talks
about
recovery
facilities?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
a
very
strange
clarification.
if
the
epa
reg
was
clear
and
explicit
and
the
statute
is
silent,
it
seems
to
me
rather
odd
to
accept
the
claim
of
the
statute
that
it's
clarifying
as
distinct
from
changing.
