mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
incinerators
that
recover
energy
from
the
burning
of
municipal
solid
waste,
known
as
resource
recovery
facilities,
received
an
exemption
from
federal
hazardous
waste
regulation
under
a
1984
amendment
to
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
that
exemption
ceases
to
have
effect
once
these
incinerators
actually
burn
the
waste
sent
there
for
incineration.
the
1984
amendment
is
entitled,
clarification
of
household
waste
exclusion.
on
its
face,
it
requires
some
understanding
of
what
the
household
waste
exclusion
was,
and
what
congress
was
seeking
to
clarify
in
1984.
accordingly,
i
will
begin
by
examining
the
regulatory
framework
that
confronted
congress
when
it
enacted
the
statute,
and
i
will
then
discuss
the
statute's
purpose,
history,
and
its
text.
i
will
leave
the
question
of
what
deference
is
owed
to
the
views
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
on
this
statute
to
the
united
states.
in
1976,
congress
first
enacted
rcra,
creating
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
the
disposal
of
solid
waste.
rcra
divides
solid
waste
into
two
categories,
hazardous,
and
nonhazardous.
it
creates
a
far
more
demanding,
expensive,
and
cumbersome
scheme
for
the
disposal
of
hazardous
waste.
in
the
statute,
congress
delegated
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
the
authority
to
define
by
regulation
what
substances
should
be
deemed
hazardous.
household
waste
poses
special
problems
within
this
regulatory
framework.
although
the
vast
majority
of
household
waste
is
nonhazardous,
occasionally
people
do
throw
away
things
that
technically
qualify
as
hazardous...
the
used
flashlight
battery
or
the
occasional
can
of
paint
thinner.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
given
the
posture
we
are
in
today,
yes,
i
think
the
court--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--has
to
take
that
as
given.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
the
city
contracts
first
with
a
hauler
to
take
the
ash
to
a
landfill
and
second
with
the
landfill,
at
which
the
ash
is
disposed.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
at
one
point
in
this
case
it
was.
currently,
the
ash
is
being
disposed
of
at
lined
monofill
in
joliet,
illinois.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
it
has
a
contract
with
the
city.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
i
do,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
that
is
in
fact
what
the
household
waste
exclusion
was
when
originally
promulgated,
and
what
was
continued
by
congress--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--i
think
it
is
both
from
the
language
of
the
statute
and
when
it's
placed
in
the
context
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
clarify.
of
course,
in--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
it
is
the
deeming
clause,
because
the
statute
says
that
the
resource
recovery
facility
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
treating,
storing,
disposing
or
otherwise
managing
hazardous
waste.
if
you
think
that
the
hazardous
waste
regulations
apply
when
the
garbage
arrives
at
the
landfill
because
of
the
fortuity
that
we
don't
use
our
own
landfill,
then
at
that
point,
as
they
dump
the
waste
off
the
truck,
you
would
be
deeming
the
city,
or
edf
does
deem
the
city
to
be
disposing
of
hazardous
waste
at
that
point,
but
the
statute
prohibits
that
result.
it
says
that
a
resource
recovery
facility
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
disposing
of
hazardous
waste,
so--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--that's
correct,
and
what
that
means,
i
take
it,
is
that
if
you
think
that
the
resource
recovery
facility...
in
this
case
edf
argues
that
as
the
employees
of
the
resource
recovery
facility
are
sweeping
out
the
ash
from
the
incinerator
and
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
it,
the
employees
are
supposed
to
treat
that
ash
as
hazardous
waste
and
ship
it
and
dispose
of
it
under
those
regulations.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
of
course,
the
only
defendant
in
this
case
is
the
resource
recovery
facility,
because
i
take
it
even
edf
doesn't
think
that
congress
intended
to
create
an
exemption
where
if
the
resource
recovery
facility
disposes
of
the
material
on
site
at
its
own
landfill,
adjacent
to
the
incinerator,
congress
would
treat
all
that
as
exempt,
but
the
fortuity
that
you
instead
use
an
independent
contractor
off-site,
that
would
trigger
a
different
result.
edf
apparently
doesn't
even
think
that
distinction
makes
any
sense,
and
i
think
especially
when
you
put
the
plain
language
into
the
regulatory
context,
it
becomes
quite
clear,
because
when
epa
defined
by
regulation
what
was
hazardous
in
1980,
it
bowed
to
the
practical
reality.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
eds
did
the
testing.
the
city
has
never--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--it
was.
it
was
from
1981
to
1987,
the
tests
relevant
to
this
facility.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
the
city
had
always
taken
the
position
that
the
ash
was
not
hazardous
waste
under
the
epa
regulation.
edf
questioned
that,
and
that
led
to
the
test
that
in
turn
led
to
this
litigation.
in
1980,
when
the
regulation
was
promulgated,
it
said
that
the
entire
household
wastestream
was
excluded,
up
to
and
including
the
ash,
and
it
was
explicit.
epa
was
explicit
in
excluding
the
ash.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
that's
correct.
then,
in
1984,
this
statute
was
enacted.
the
statute,
of
course,
is
entitled,
"clarification
of
household
waste
exclusion".
not
"modification",
or
"repudiation"...
"clarification
of
household
waste
exclusion".
congress
expressly
referred
to
and
incorporated
an
existing
construct,
which
was
a
wastestream
exemption.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
the
official
position
in...
epa
put
out
a
statement
in
1985
which
by
1987,
when
mr.
porter
testified
before
congress
they
were
already
saying,
our
position
doesn't
really
make
a
lot
of
sense.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
my
answer
is
that
their
official
position
was
that
they
saw
no
intent
on
the
statute
to
reach
the
ash,
but
that
they
weren't
going
to
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
never.
the
city
never
complied
with
subtitle
c,
took
the
position
throughout
that
period
of
time
that
it
wasn't
applicable,
the
united
states
never
brought
an
enforcement
action
against
the
city
or
any
other
resource
recovery
facility,
and
after
the
congressional
moratorium
on
new
epa
regulations
expired
we
found
administrator
reilly's
ruling
on
this
subject,
which
repudiated
the
1985
statement.
in
short,
given
this
context,
a
principle
of
statutory
construction
comes
into
play
which
i
think
is
quite
useful
in
resolving
this
case,
that
principle
being
that
congress
is
deemed
to
approve
of
existing
administrative
practices
or
constructions
when
it
legislates
absent
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary,
and
the
reason
i
think
that
principle
is
useful
is
because
when
i
look
for
the
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary,
i
cannot
find
any.
i
cannot
find
any
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
which
again
is
entitled,
"clarification
of
household
waste
exclusion".
congress
thought
it
was
clarifying
something
that
was
not
previously
clear,
and
in
two
respects
undisputed
in
this
case,
it
was
clarifying.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
and
of
course,
we
need
go
no
further
in
this
case
than
that.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
in
cases
like
north
haven
board
of
education
v.
bell,
the
court
has
applied
this
principle
even
when
the
congress
amends
other
portions
of
the
statute,
but
not
the
pertinent
portion
of
the
statute.
here,
of
course,
we
need
not
guess,
because
congress
explicitly
put
into
the
statute
the
household
waste
exclusion.
it
is--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--it
was
not,
because
it
was
issued
pursuant
to
epa's
delegated
power
to
define
what
hazardous
waste
is,
so
it
is
written
in
terms
of
the
definition
of
hazardous
waste.
it
does
not
use
the
word,
"deeming",
but
i
do
take
it
that
when
congress
tells
us
that
what
it
thinks
it
is
doing
is
clarifying
the
household
waste
exclusion,
congress
should
be
taken
at
its
word.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
when
you
start...
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
take
congress
at
its
word.
congress
knows
how
to--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
of
course,
congress
enacted--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
of
course,
justice
souter,
congress
enacted
all
those
words,
and
i
think
they
all
have
to
be
taken
at
their
word.
we
start
with,
i
think,
a
strong
presumption
that
congress
should
be
read
simply
to
be
clarifying
the
existing
regulatory
construct.
if
we
can
find
clear
evidence
further
down
in
the
statute
that
congress
misrepresented
the
statute
in
its
title,
maybe
there
would
be
a
different
result,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
clear
evidence
further
down.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
i'm
trying
not
to,
because
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
clarify
in
two
respects
that
are
not
in
dispute,
which
i
think
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
language
does
not
precisely
track
epa's
household
waste
exclusion.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
i
quite
agree,
and
it
is
our
view
that
congress
was
clarifying,
not
ratifying.
in
fact,
it
was
quite
unclear
under
epa's
household
waste
exclusion
whether,
if
a
facility
also
received
nonhazardous
commercial
and
industrial
waste
in
addition
to
household
waste,
it
would
still
qualify
for
the
household
waste
exclusion.
that
was
entirely
unclear.
congress
clarified
that
by
making
it
explicit,
broadening
the
exemption
to
say,
if
you
also
except
nonhazardous
commercial
and
industrial
waste,
you
qualify.
absent
some
very
clear
indication
that
congress
was
not
serious
and
should
not
be
taken
at
its
word
when
it
said
it
was
clarifying,
congress
should
not
be
deemed
to
have
worked
such
a
fundamental
and
far-reaching
change
in
the
prior
regulatory
framework,
and
indeed,
if
one
is
looking
for
evidence
of
an
intent
to
change
the
law...
not
to
clarify
it,
but
to
change,
to
dramatically
narrow
the
previous
household
waste
exclusion,
one
certainly
cannot
find
it
in
the
legislative
history.
in
fact,
edf's
position
on
the
legislative
history,
of
course,
is
ignore
it,
because
if
you
do
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it
addresses
this
problem
clearly
and
expressly,
and
far
from
evincing
an
intent
to
dramatically
narrow
the
exclusion,
it
embraces
the
exclusion.
it
states
that
it
recognizes
it
is
a
wastestream
exclusion,
goes
on
to
say
that
resource
recovery
facilities
should
be
fit
within
the
household
waste
exclusion,
and
it
further
states
that
economic
impediments
to
the
success
of
the
resource
recovery
process
should
be
removed.
so
if
you
did
enforce
at
the
landfill,
if
you
will,
you
would
have
created
a
huge
economic
disincentive
to
the
resource
recovery
process
without
any
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
create
this
massive
new
regulatory
burden.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
of
course,
hazardous
disposal
is
a
defined
term.
it
says,
"putting
the
waste
in
land
or
water
so
that
it
could
be
exposed
to
the
environment.
"
and
in
my
view
there
is
really
only
one
point
in
the
process
at
which
this
ash
is
disposed
of,
and
that's
when
it
goes
to
the
landfill.
that...
and
as
administrator
reilly
notes
in
his
ruling
on
the
subject,
ordinarily
the
only
hazardous
waste
that
these
facilities
dispose
of
is
the
ash.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
the
precise
act
by
which
the
ash
is
generated,
incineration,
is
already
covered
by
the
statute,
because
that
act
is
treatment
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
congress
put
treatment
in,
so
it
would
have
been
surplusage
to
also
put
generation
in.
indeed,
epa's
own
household
waste
exclusion
didn't
use
the
term,
generation.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
if
the
act
of
generating
is
already
exempt
under
another
term
that
congress
put
into
the
statute,
and
in
my
view
it
is,
it's
already
exempt
because
it's
treatment.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
it
did.
i
take
it
that
the
author
of
that
report,
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
because
it
was
clear
to
the
author
of
that
report
that
everything
was
exempt,
put
the
word
in,
but
the
drafter
of
the
statute
evidently
worried
that
if
surplusage
was
put
into
the
statute,
that
might
create
some
mischief,
track
the
household
waste
exclusion,
which
itself
did
not
use
the
term,
generation.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
statute's
underlying
purpose,
this
becomes
even
clearer,
because
of
course,
congress
has
told
us
what
its
purpose
is.
it
enacted
a
purpose
provision
in
rcra.
it
had
two
relevant
purposes...
to
encourage
resource
recovery,
and
reduce
the
nation's
need
for
landfill
space,
and
as
administrator
reilly
recognized,
those
purposes
would
be
dramatically
undercut
if
the
exemption
didn't
extend
to
ash.
indeed,
on
edf's
view,
this
entire
statute
is
meaningless,
because
edf
believes
that
only
the
incoming
wastestream
is
exempted
by
the
statute,
but
the
incoming
wastestream
was
already
exempt
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
all
the
incoming
household
waste
was
exempt
from
household
waste
regulation
under
the
epa
regulation,
and
nonhazardous
commercial
and
industrial
waste
by
definition
was
exempt,
so
on
epa's
view,
this
statute
is
a
completely
empty
gesture.
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
sensible
way
to
construe
it.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
it
is
frequent.
i
don't
know
which
pattern
is
more
common,
but
it
is
certainly
frequent
that
landfill
space
is
owned
by
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
it
does
not
clarify
that
at
all
if
it
only
deals
with
the
incoming
wastestream,
because
that
incoming
wastestream
was
already
exempt
because
it
is
by
definition
nonhazardous.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
if
it
included...
if
the
incoming
wastestream
included
only
household
waste
and
nonhazardous
commercial
and
industrial
waste,
nothing
in
that
incoming
wastestream
would
be
subject
to
hazardous
waste
regulation
under
rcra,
prior
to
1984.
this
leads
me,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
to
the
epa's
view,
and
on
that
i
will
defer
myself
to
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
first
turn
to
the
question
whether
what
we
have
here
is
a
wastestream
exemption,
because
no
one
should
mistake
the
boldness
of
what
edf
is
asking
this
court
to
hold.
edf
is
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
congress
was
misrepresenting
when
it
crafted
this
statute,
that
congress
in
fact
wasn't
clarifying
anything,
that
that
is
a
misrepresentation,
that
congress
intended
to
dramatically
narrow
the
scope
of
the
exemption
that
these
facilities
receive
if
they
mix
in,
to
use
mr.
lazarus'
words,
any
nonhazardous
commercial
and
industrial
waste.
the
interesting
thing
about
the
record
in
this
case
is
it
shows
that
99
percent
of
what
this
facility
receives
is
household
waste.
on
edf's
view,
because
the
city
mixes
in
1
percent,
or
less
than
1
percent,
nonhazardous
commercial
and
industrial
waste,
congress
would
have
intended
a
dramatically
different
result,
would
have
intended
to
end
the
wastestream
exemption.
it
is,
as
one
of
justice
ginsburg's
questions
noted,
it
is
the
resource
recovery
facility
itself
that
must
find
a
way
to
dispose
of
the
ash.
when
that
ash
is
on-site,
it
is
the
resource
recovery
facility's
problem.
how
are
you
going
to
dispose
of
it?
are
you
going
to
have
to
dispose
of
it
as
hazardous
waste,
and
pay
$453
a
ton,
according
to
epa's
estimates,
or
can
you
dispose
of
it
at
a
more
feasible
cost
of
$42
a
ton
as
nonhazardous
waste?
for
all
these
reasons,
i
ask
the
judgment
be
reversed.
