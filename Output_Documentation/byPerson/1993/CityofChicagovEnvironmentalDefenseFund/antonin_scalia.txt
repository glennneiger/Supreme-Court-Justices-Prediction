mr.
minear,
why
was
there
no
need
for
notice
and
comment
for
this
interpretive
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
requirement
for
notice
and
comment?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
them
that
are
interpretive
regulations
the
agency
was
just
doing
voluntarily.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
household
waste
was
already
excluded--
justice
antonin
scalia
--before
this
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
assume
that
the
subject
of
the
sentence
is
a
resource
recovery
facility
recovering
energy,
and
maybe
the
subject
is
a
resource
recovery
facility.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
has
to
be
recovering
energy
from
mass
burning,
but
it
may
be
doing
other
things
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
think
that,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
language
is
clear
on
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
storing
the
household
waste
prior
to
its
combustion
isn't
covered,
because
that
is
not
a
resource
recovery
facility
recovering
energy.
it's
not
doing
anything.
it's
just
sitting
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
we
agree
with
the
argument
you've
just
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
us
to
go
so
far
as
to
agree
with
the
logic
of
what
you've
said,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
petitioners,
defendants
in
the
district
court,
are
the
city
of
chicago
and
its
mayor.
i
shall
refer
to
both
of
them
as
the
city.
since
1971,
the
city
has
operated
a
municipal
incinerator,
the
northwest
waste-to-energy
facility
that
recovers
energy
from
the
burning
of
solid
waste.
the
city
has
disposed
of
the
ash
from
this
facility
110,000-140,000
tons
per
year
at
landfills
that
are
not
licensed
to
accept
hazardous
wastes.
the
respondent,
environmental
defense
fund,
filed
a
complaint
against
the
city
alleging
that
the
facility's
ash
residue
is
toxic
and
that
the
city
was
therefore
violating
what
the
cognoscenti
known
as
rcra,
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
of
1976,
by
disposing
of
the
ash
in
ordinary
landfills.
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
city
on
the
ground
that
section
3001(i)
of
the
solid
waste
disposal
act,
a
provision
within
rcra,
excluded
the
ash
from
the
rcra's
subtitle
c
requirements
addressing
hazardous
wastes.
section
3001(i)
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case
provides
that
"a
resource
recovery
facility
recovering
energy
from
the
mass
burning
of
municipal
solid
waste
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
treating,
storing,
disposing
of,
or
otherwise
managing
hazardous
wastes
for
the
purposes
of
regulation
under
this
subchapter
if
such
facility
receives
and
burns
only
household
waste
and
non-hazardous
industrial
waste."
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
district
court's
decision
that
this
did
not
violate
3001(i)
and
reversed.
while
certiorari
was
pending
in
this
court,
the
environmental
protection
agency
issued
a
memorandum
stating
that
under
its
view
of
3001(i)
the
ash
is
indeed
exempt
from
subtitle
c
regulation
contrary,
of
course,
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
said.
on
remand,
following
this
court's
vacation
of
the
judgment,
the
court
of
appeals
reinstated
its
previous
opinion
holding
that
because
the
statute's
plain
language
is
dispositive,
the
epa
memorandum
did
not
affect
its
analysis.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm.
section
3001(i)
does
not
exempt
the
ash
generated
by
petitioner's
facility
from
subtitle
c
regulation
as
hazardous
waste.
a
brief
3001(i)
epa
regulation
provided
a
so-called
waste
stream
exemption
covering
household
waste
from
generation
through
treatment
to
final
disposal
of
residues.
that
was
a
regulation.
but
petitioner's
facility
would
not
have
come
within
that
exemption
because
it
burned,
as
i
described
earlier,
not
only
household
waste
but
non-hazardous
industrial
waste.
assuming
that
the
ash
generated
by
this
facility
was
toxic,
the
facility
would
have
been
considered
a
subtitle
c
hazardous
waste
generator,
although
not,
a
more
astringently
regulated
subtitle
c
hazardous
waste
treatment,
storage,
and
disposal
facility
since
all
the
waste
it
took
in
was
non-hazardous.
section
3001(i),
we
hold,
cannot
be
interpreted
as
extending
the
preexisting
waste
stream
exemption
to
the
product
of
a
combined
household
non-hazardous
industrial
treatment
facility
such
as
petitioner's.
although
the
section
is
entitled
clarification
of
household
waste
exclusion,
its
plain
language
which
says
that
a
resource
recovery
facility
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
treating,
storing,
disposing
of,
or
otherwise
managing
hazardous
wastes.
it
establishes
that
its
exemption
is
limited
to
the
facility
itself
and
does
not
extend
to
the
ash
that
the
facility
generates.
the
statutory
text's
prominent
omission
of
any
reference
to
generation,
and
not
the
single
reference
to
generation
in
the
legislative
history,
is
the
authoritative
expression
of
the
law.
the
enacted
text
requires
rejection
of
the
government's
plea
for
deference
to
epa's
interpretation
which
goes
beyond
the
scope
of
whatever
ambiguity
3001(i)
contains.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
