mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
chicago
and
edf
each
argue
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
but
they
reach
very
different
conclusions
as
to
what
that
language
means.
as
their
disagreement
suggests,
section
3001(i)
does
not
squarely
resolve
the
precise
issue
before
the
court.
the
statute
says
nothing
specific
about
ash
residues,
and
the
statute
is
ambiguous
on
the
more
general
question
of
whether
it
grants
an
exemption
covering
all
of
the
facility's
operations,
including
ash
disposal.
the
practical
results
of
this
case
closely
parallel
chevron
itself,
where
the
issue
was
whether
the
clean
air
act
regulates
stationery
sources
on
a
plant-wide
or
component-by-component
basis,
and
as
in
chevron,
the
court
should
look
for
guidance
from
the
administrative
agency
that
is
the
expert
in
this
field
and
that
is
charged
with
administering
the
statute.
the
epa's
views
are
highly
relevant
in
this
situation,
because
rcra
gives--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
is
actually
a
memorandum
issued
from
the
director,
the
administrator
of
epa,
to
the
regional
administrators
directing
them
how
they
should
enforce
the
act.
in
epa
parlance,
that
would
be
an
interpretive
rule.
now,
chevron
itself
also
involved
an
interpretive
rule.
the
only
difference
between
the
two
situations
was
the
chevron
case
involved
an
interpretive
rule
that
was
subject
to
notice
and
comment.
however,
it
is
our
view
that
notice
and
comment
does
not
have
any
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
the
interpretation
is
entitled
to
deference.
the
question
instead
is
whether
this
is
an
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
agency,
and
that
in
fact
it
is.
it
comes
directly
from
the
administrator
himself.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
one
of
the
problems
in
this
area
obviously
is
that
epa's
household
waste
exclusion,
which
it
passed
as
a
legislative
rule
in
1980,
exempts
a
wastestream
from
the
time
that
the
household
waste
is
picked
up
at
curbside
until
it
finds
its
ultimate
destination
in
an
incinerator
or
a
landfill.
section
3001(i)
is
in
fact
a
facility
or
process
exemption
instead,
and
epa
has
attempted
to
reconcile
these
two
by
in
fact
saying
that
we
look
at
the
matter
this
way,
and
this
is
set
forth
in
footnote
9
of
our
brief
on
page...
footnote
6
at
page
19.
the
incinerator
that
receives
the
waste,
it
has
the
exemption
up
to
the
time
it
burns
it,
obviously.
the
exemption
is
section
3001
exemption
allows
it
to
mix
household
waste
with
nonhazardous
commercial
waste.
the
question
then
arises,
what
about
the
ash
that
results
from
this?
if
the
ash
is
nonhazardous,
then
there
is
no
question
there
has
been
no
generation
of
a
hazardous
waste,
and
it
could
be
sent
to
the
landfill.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
ash
does
test
positive,
is
hazardous,
the
question
is,
what
do
we
do
then,
and
that
is
the
question
that
epa
has
in
fact
answered
through
its
interpretive
memorandum.
it's
indicated
that
in
that
situation
the
household...
the
facility,
the
resource
recovery
facility,
preserves
the
exemption.
the
exemption
continues
to
apply
to
the
wastestream
and
it
can
send
it
on
to
a
landfill.
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
the
statute
itself
is
ambiguous
on
this,
and
that...
for
that
reason,
the
epa
has
made
the
interpretation
that
the
exemption
continues
to
apply,
just
as
if
household
waste
alone
was
incinerated.
keep
in
mind--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
right.
you
don't
ultimately
have
to
decide
it,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
issue
in
deciding
what
this
regulation
in
fact
does,
what
the
household
waste
exclusion
does,
what
the
clarification
itself
does,
and
i
think
that's
a
relevant
consideration.
it's
obviously
something
that
epa
has
considered
in
reaching
its
formulation
of
the
issue,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that's
right,
and
epa,
as
i
say,
has
now
clarified
that
in
the
interpretive
memorandum
that
administrator
reilly
issued.
they
made
clear
that
the
exemption
continues
to
apply
to
the
ash.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
technically,
this
case
is
only
against
the
resource
recovery
facility,
and
that
is
all
i
meant
to
imply
by
whether
you
could
decide
the
issue,
you
needed
to
decide
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
the
resource
recovery
facility
can
take
advantage
of
that
exemption,
and
it
leaves
open...
this
case
does
not
necessarily
involve
the
landfill
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there's
about
150
resource
recovery
facilities.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
this
regulation
is...
or
this
statement
by
the
agency
is
a
statement
of
nonregulation.
it's
stating
that
it
will
not
regulate
this
particular
waste
disposal
practice.
a
1985
statement
that
was
issued
as
part
of
the...
another
regulation
that
also
did
not
have
notice
and
comment
indicated
that
the
statute
was
silent
on
this
issue
and
that
further
technical
studies
need
to
be
done,
but
it
would
not
be
imposing
any
additional
regulations,
and
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
it
is
not.
notice
and
comment
is
required
in
those
cases
other
than
interpretive
regulations,
but
in
fact,
in
many
cases
of
interpretive
regulations
the
agency
utilizes
notice
and
comment,
because
it's
very
helpful
in
the
process.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
many
cases,
it
is.
it
is
useful
for
the
agency
to
have
notice
and
comment
to
get
a
full
panoply
of
views
so
it
can
reach
a
reasoned
determination
on
a
particular
matter.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
there's
even
disagreement
about
the
ambiguity,
but
let
me
point
to
two
sources
of
ambiguity.
one
is
the
grammatical
ambiguity,
the
opening
phrase
here,
"resource
recovery
facility
recovering
energy
from--
"
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
it
is
unclear
whether
recovering
energy
is
a
true
participle
or
fused
participle,
using
henry
fowler's
modern
english
usage,
and
that
does
lead
to
some
ambiguity.
does
this
say,
a
resource
recovery
facility
that
recovers
energy,
or
is
it
really
focusing
on
the
gerund,
recovering
energy
itself?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
because
if
congress
is
only
concerned
with
the
recovering
energy
from
the
mass
burning
of
waste,
it
presumably
is
only
concerned
with
the
incineration
process
and
not
other
parts
of
the
facilities
operations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
on
that
point,
the
statute
in
fact
is
silent.
in
this
situation,
it's
important
to
mention
the
context--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
right,
but
it's
meant
to
clarify
epa's
regulation,
the
household
waste
exclusion,
which
did
indicate
that
treated
waste...
in
other
words,
ash...
would
continue
to
be
exempt,
so
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--this
might
help
to
clarify
the
issue.
if
household
waste
alone
was
burned
in
the
resource
recovery
facility,
the
ash
from
that
product
under
the
1980
regulation
would
in
fact
be
exempt,
and
this
just
simply
goes
on
to
the
question
of
whether
the
combined
waste
then
would
be
exempt
as
well.
