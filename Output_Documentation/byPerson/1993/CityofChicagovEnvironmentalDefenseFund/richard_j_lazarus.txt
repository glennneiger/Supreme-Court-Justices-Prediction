mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
and
the
united
states
this
morning
are
making
different,
yet
equally
implausible,
claims.
the
city
claims
that
section
3001(i)'s
plain
meaning
exempts
from
subchapter
c
hazardous
waste
regulation
facilities
that
that
provision
never
mentions,
and
generator
requirements
that
that
provision
never
mentions.
now,
the
united
states
agrees
with
us
that
the
plain
meaning
provision
doesn't
support
the
city's
construction,
but
then
reaches
the
same
result
through
its
own,
equally
flawed
analysis.
both
the
city
and
the
united
states,
however,
are
wrong
for
precisely
the
same
reason,
and
that
reason
is
section
3001(i)'s
plain
meaning.
section
3001(i)
means
just
what
it
says,
no
more
and
no
less.
it
exempts
certain
activities
of
a
particular
kind
of
resource
recovery
facility
from
subchapter
c.
it
does
not
purport
to
exempt
any
activities
of
any
other
kind
of
facility,
nor
does
it
purport
to
exempt
the
resource
recovery
facility
from
the
distinct
generator
requirements
of
subchapter
c.
let's
look
at
section
3001(i),
the
language
of
it,
and
consider
precisely
what
the
city
is
arguing.
right
now,
in
joliet,
illinois,
there
is
a
private
landfill
disposal
operator
that
is
disposing
of
180,000
tons
of
hazardous
ash
in
a
landfill
that
congress
deemed
not
to
have
the
safeguards
necessary
for
the
disposal
of
hazardous
waste.
now,
the
city
claims
that
that
private
landfill
operator
is
exempt
from
subchapter
c.
where
in
the
language
of
section
3001(i)
do
they
find
that
intent?
is
that
landfill
operator
ever
mentioned
in
section
3001(i)?
no.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes,
it
did.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
because
it
was
essential
in
this
case,
your
honor,
to
prove
that
there
was
a
violation
by
the
resource
recovery
facility
itself.
rcra
is
a
complicated
statute,
but
the
pieces
of
it
are
very
clearly
defined
by
congress
in
the
statutory
definition,
and
they
fit
together,
ultimately,
we
think
to
present
a
clear
picture,
and
let
me
explain,
your
honor.
it's
quite
clear
in
section
3001(i)
that
congress
did
not
create
what
is
deemed
a
wastestream
exemption.
they
did
not
exempt
any
facilities
other
than
the
resource
recovery
facility
itself.
there's
no
way
you
can
read
that
statute
to
create
a
subchapter
c
regulation
for
any
other
facility.
because
congress
is
not
creating
a
wastestream
exemption,
congress
also
clearly
omitted
from
section
3001(i)
any
exemption
from
the
distinct
generator
requirements
under
section
3002,
which
are
distinct
from
the
treatment
storage
and
disposal
requirements
which
they
are
exempt
from
under
3004.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
they
do
not.
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
that
issue
here.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
on
that
issue,
our
position
is
that
section
3001(i)
was
regulating
one
kind
of
activity
from
the
resource
recovery
facility,
and
that
is
the
recovery
process
itself.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--and
that
would
be
distinct
from
our
generator
argument
and
our
downstream
argument,
but
let
me
explain
why.
if
the
city,
for
instance,
as
suggested
by
mr.
rosenthal,
put
a
disposal
facility
on
site,
they
couldn't
claim
that
exemption,
because
section
3001(i)
only
exempts
a
resource
recovery
facility.
it
doesn't
purport
to
exempt
any
other
activity
that
they
might
attempt
to
engage
in
there.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it
loses
its
exemption
at
the
moment
the
incineration
resource
recovery
process
is
over.
the
statute...
what
it's
doing,
it
means
that
although
the
city
is
clearly
treating
the
hazardous
waste,
and
would
otherwise
be
subject
to
3004
of
rcra,
it
doesn't
have
to
seek
a
section
3004
permit,
because
it
is
deemed
not
to
be
a
rcra
permitted
facility
under
subchapter
c.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
what
the
statute
deems
is
that
a
particular
activity
will
not
be
considered
to
be
management
of
a
hazardous
waste.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it
does
the
city
an
incredible
amount
of
good.
they
don't
have
to
try
to
obtain
a
permit
under
section
3004
of
rcra,
which
includes
rcra's
most
rigorous
performance
requirements
for
the
treatment,
corrective
action,
financial
assurance
requirements...
two-thirds
of
the
incinerated...
two-thirds,
excuse
me,
of
the
facilities
that
are
subject
to
section
3004
after
congress
passed
it
in
1984
closed
rather
than
try
to
get
those
permits.
one-half
of
them
were
denied
the
permits
when
they
tried.
the
city
doesn't
have
to
achieve
that.
every--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes.
your
honor,
but
before
the
1984
amendment
there
was
absolutely
no
codification
ever
in
the
statute
to
that
effect,
and
the
cities
were
making
investments.
in
addition,
there
was
no
allowance
for
them
to
mix
it
with
other
kinds
of
waste,
and
no
allowance
for
their
inadvertent
receipt
of
hazardous
waste.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
there's
no
doubt
in
our
mind,
and
in
several
states
they
manage
their
ash
under
subchapter
c
in
their
states
rather
than--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes.
they
choose
to
do
it
under
subchapter
c
rather
than
d,
and
actually
that's
in
the
record
in
this
case.
district
court
docket
number
73,
an
affidavit
submitted
to
that
effect.
but
let
me
explain
why
it
will
still
be
economical.
there
are
significant
volume
reduction
benefits
and
energy
benefits,
but
most
importantly,
if
this
fiction
is
eliminated,
the
city
will
quite
quickly
have
an
incentive
to
take
the
rational
steps,
and
the
most
simple
steps
they
can
take
is
that
the
ash,
which
is
hazardous,
the
ash
which
tends
to
flunk
epa's
toxicity
characteristic
analysis,
is
the
fly
ash.
that's
where
the
heavy
metals
go.
that's
10
percent
by
weight
of
the
ash
which
is
produced.
the
bottom
ash...
the
bottom
ash
does
not
tend
to
be
hazardous.
currently,
because
the
city
lacks
any
economic
incentive,
they
mix
the
two,
producing
100
units
of
ash
that
flunks
the
epa
toxicity
characteristic
analysis
instead
of
10
units
of
that
ash.
they
could
quickly
reduce
their
cost
by
tenfold
just
by
not
affirmatively
mixing
the
two,
and
that--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--excuse
me?
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it
comes
from
the
household
ash
and
it
also
can
come
from
the
nonhazardous
industrial
and
commercial
waste,
and
that's
because
although
the
industrial
and
commercial
waste
may
be
nonhazardous,
they
may
contain
hazardous
constituents,
and
those
hazardous
constituents,
because
of
the
incineration
process,
do
two
things:
1)
they
become
concentrated
in
the
ash,
and
2)
they
now
become
on...
become
placed
on
a
material...
that
is,
ash...
with
a
very
significant
surface,
percentage
of
surface
on
it
and
the
surface
matter
of
ash,
and
the
concentration
which
together
caused
the
ash
to
flunk
epa's
toxicity
characteristic
analysis,
which
looks
to
whether
a
substance
is
likely
to
leach
in
a
landfill,
and
it's
because
it's
ash,
because
it's
concentrated.
so
the
hazardous
waste
here
could
well
come
not
just
from
the
household
waste,
the
hazardous
ash
could
well
come
from
the
commercial
industrial
waste
which
has
hazardous
constituents.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
we
don't
contest
that
here,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes,
they
would,
because
they
would
have
generated
a
hazardous
waste.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes,
because...
they
have,
obviously,
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but
they're
going
to
end
up
with
much,
much
less,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
volume
of
it.
there's
things
that
they
could
do,
your
honor,
to
try
to
avoid
that.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
they
could
try
source
separation
in
the
first
instance.
they
could
try
to
avoid
putting
the
kinds
of--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--oh,
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--they
certainly
do,
and
let
me
explain.
there
are
180
million
tons
of
municipal
solid
waste
produced
each
year.
less
than
1
percent
of
that
would
qualify
as
hazardous
waste.
if
you
look
to
the
ash
that's
produced,
because
of
the
concentration,
because
of
the
ash
material,
as
in
this
case,
32
out
of
35
samples
flunk
epa's
toxicity
characteristic
analysis.
this
is
a
fundamental
chemical
transformation,
and
that
is
the
concentration
and
the
material,
and
that's
why
it
flunks
epa's
toxicity
characteristic
analysis.
it's
one
thing
for
congress,
your
honor...
it's
one
thing
for
congress
to
have
exempted
a
waste
where,
out
of
180
million
tons,
less
than
1
percent
is
hazardous,
and
not
to
require
the
municipality
to
sort
through
that.
it's
a
very
different
policy
view,
and
it's
an
essential
distinction,
we
believe,
not
to
exempt
a
substance,
when
once
you
have
isolated
the
part
which
is
hazardous,
which
is
on
an
ash
material,
which
has
the
toxicity
characteristic
analysis,
not
to
exempt
that.
when
congress
wanted,
your
honor...
when
congress
wanted
to
create
a
wastestream
exemption
in
rcra,
congress
did
it
explicitly,
and
they
did
it
with
procedural
safeguards.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
we're
not
questioning
that.
it
wasn't
a
wastestream
exemption,
though,
that
actually
would
have
applied
to
this
case,
because
as
epa
recognized
in
1985,
in
their
preamble
statement,
right
after
rcra's
enactment,
that
hazardous
waste...
excuse
me,
that
exclusion
only
applied
to
the
incineration
of
household
waste.
it
didn't
apply
to
the
incineration
of
household
waste
mixed
with
other
kinds
of
waste,
and
that's
why
epa
said
in
1985
that
under
epa's
then-existing
regulations
this
ash
would
not
be
exempt,
but
wholly
apart
from
that,
wholly
apart
from
the
gratuity
in
this
case,
that
we
don't
have
a
mixture,
we
think
that
congress
addressed
the
issue
for
the
first
time
in
1984
in
3001(i).
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
not
silently,
your
honor.
i
think
as
mr.
rosenthal
said,
this
is
not
a
question
of
congressional
silence,
this
is
a
question
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
the
plain
meanings
of
the
words
of
the
statute
creates
one
kind
of
exemption,
and
that's
a
facility
exemption.
and
if
you
look
at
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
presented
by
both
the
united
states
and
by
the
city
of
chicago,
the
question
presented
is
whether
section
3001(i)
of
rcra
exempts
the
act.
it's
a
wastestream
exemption
premised
on
one
provision.
they
aren't
arguing
for
facility
exemption,
they're
arguing
for
a
wastestream
exemption.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
your
honor,
in
this
case,
first
of
all
that
doesn't
apply,
because
section
3001(i)...
excuse
me,
the
prior
administrative
construction
wouldn't
have
covered
this
situation,
and
that
is
a
situation
of
the
mixture,
and
whatever
presumption
might
exist,
your
honor,
that
presumption
is
clearly
overcome
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
which
did
not
adopt
the
word
and
the
language
of
that
prior
regulation.
that
prior
regulation
was
written
as
a
wastestream
exemption.
section
3001(i)
is
written
as
a
facility
exemption.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
before
1984,
a
resource
recovery
facility
which
mixed
household
waste
with
nonhousehold
waste,
waste
from
commercial
industrial
sources,
had
no
benefit
from
the
household
waste
exclusion.
one
of
the
things
section
3001(i)
did
was
allowed
them
to
mix
the
two,
and
allowed
for
the
inadvertent
receipt
of
hazardous
waste
by
allowing
for
certain
kinds
of
procedural
safeguards,
and
gave
basically
some
kind
of
protection
for
municipalities
so
that
they
could
avoid
regulation
under
section
3004,
which
was
the
rcra
permit
requirements.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
the
cost
estimates
are
in--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
your
honor,
in
the
record,
there's
really
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
their
claims
or
our
claims.
we're
both
dealing
with
extra-record
material.
we
think
that
the
support
that
we
have
given
in
this
case
in
which
we've
tried
to
rely
in
our
brief
on
epa
reports
and
legislative
reports
bear
out
our
position.
one
reason
we
don't
have
an
administrative
record,
your
honor,
is
also
one
reason
why
we
don't
think
epa's
view
should
be
entitled
to
any
deference.
there's
no
administrative
record
in
this
case,
there's
no
record
evidence,
because
epa
has
never
promulgated
a
legislative
rule
on
this
issue.
the
record
would
no
doubt
be
much
better
if
there
had
been
a
legislative
rule.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
in
a
case
like
this,
your
honor,
where
epa
had
said
in
a
prior
interpretive
rule
in
1985
that
its
existing
legislative
rule
made
this
ash
subject
to
subchapter
c
regulation,
if
the
epa
is
going
to
change
its
interpretation
of
an
existing
legislative
rule,
it
should
do
it
by
a
legislative
rule,
it
shouldn't
do
it
by
an
interpretive
rule,
and
this
memorandum
in
this
case
is
at
best
an
interpretive
rule,
because
even
interpretive
rules
are
supposed
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
this
rule
was
not.
let
me
turn
the
court's
attention,
though,
just
for
a
moment
to
section
3001(b)(2)
and
(b)(3),
because
i
think
those
provisions
truly
became
highlighted
in
petitioner's
reply
brief,
show
that
congress
knew
how
to
create
a
wastestream
exemption
when
it
wanted
to.
in
section
3001(b)(2)
and
(b)(3)--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--actually,
they're
cited
in
their
reply
brief.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes.
they're
cited
in
the
reply
brief...
let
me
see
if
i
can--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes.
they
actually
do
not
give
the
text
of--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
it
wasn't
actually
until
i
saw
their
citation
of
them
i
decided
to
see
what
support
they
gave
for
the
city's
petition...
city's
position,
and
i
realized
that
actually
those
provisions
supported
our
position
and
not
the
city's,
and
so
at
that...
up
to
that
point
we
had
never
cited
those
provisions,
because
we
thought
they
were
so
obviously
distinct,
when
the
city
relied
upon
them,
it
occurred
to
me
that
actually
that
distinction
helped
our
case
more
than
i
had
taken
advantage
of
in
our
opening
brief.
in
those
provisions,
in
section
300(b)(2)
and
(b)(3),
congress
created
explicit
wastestream
exemptions,
and
that
is,
for
waste
associated
with
the
exploration,
production,
and
development
of
oil
and
natural
gas,
and
waste
from
the
combustion
of
coal,
in
those
provisions,
congress,
with
respect
to
coal
combustion,
specifically
refers
in
the
statute
to
fly
ash
and
bottom
ash,
but
at
the
same
time
that
congress
authorized
in
those
provisions
epa
to
create
a
wastestream
exemption,
congress
imposed
significant
procedural
safeguards
because
of
the
environmental
risk
associated
with
a
wastestream
exemption
as
opposed
to
a
facility
exemption.
in
particular,
congress
required
epa
to
study
the
effects
of
a
wastestream
exemption
applied
to
those
wastes.
congress
required
epa
to
hold
a
public
hearing
on
that
issue.
congress
required
epa
to
receive
public
comment
on
that
issue.
congress
required
epa,
if
it
decided
to
exempt
those
wastes
as
a
wastestream
from
subchapter
c,
to
make
a
formal
determination
to
that
effect,
and
to
report
that
determination
to
congress.
now,
what
the
city
is
seeking
in
this
case
is
a
wastestream
exemption
far
broader
than
that
created
by
congress
when
it
specifically
addressed
the
issue,
and
without
any
of
the
procedural
safeguards
that
congress
deemed
necessary
prior
to
the
creation
of
a
wastestream
exemption.
we
simply
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
statutory
language
comes
anywhere
close
to
supporting
the
city's
contention.
you
have
to
put
the
pieces
of
the
rcra
puzzle
together.
you
have
to
look
at
the
clear
definitions
of
the
terms,
generation,
management,
disposal,
and
section
1004.
there
is
only
one
facility...
there
is
only
one
facility
that
is
disposing
of
hazardous
waste
in
this
case,
and
that
facility
is
the
private
landfill
operator
in
joliet,
illinois.
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
city
is
disposing
of
hazardous
waste,
because
if
you're
disposing
of
hazardous
waste,
you
have
to
be
discharge,
depositing,
injection,
dumping,
spilling
it
or
leaking
it
or
placing
it
on
the
land
or
water,
and
there's
only
one
facility
which
is
doing
that,
and
that
facility
does
not
enjoy
the
benefit
of
subchapter
c,
and
the
city
is
violating
the
distinct
generator
requirements
under
section
3002.
because
one
of
those
requirements,
in
addition
to
the
testing
requirements,
the
determination
of
whether
it's
a
hazardous
waste,
the
labeling
requirement,
and
the
manifest
trapping
system
requirement,
which
is
so
essential
at
the
gatekeeper
to
let
the
downstream
facilities
comply
with
subchapter
c,
is
that
the
city...
also,
as
a
generator,
one
of
the
requirements
under
section
3002
is
that
the
generator
assure
that
the
waste
is
ultimately
disposed
not
by
them
but
by
somebody
else
at
a
rcra-permitted
facility
under
section
3004,
and
that
is
the
distinct
generator
requirement.
the
pieces
fit
very
nicely
together.
the
statute
is
very
clear.
this
is
not
a
statute
where
we
have
to
guess
at
the
meaning
of
the
terms.
there
are
40
terms
defined
in
section
1004
of
rcra,
very
clearly,
very
carefully
defined.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
your
honor,
actually,
under
our
reading
of
the
statute,
actually
under
the
way
the
resource
recovery
facility
works,
it's
actually
not...
you
don't
have
to
segregate
it.
it's
already
separate.
the
fly
ash
and
the
bottom
ash
are
actually--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--since
we
believe
that
the
exemption
does
apply
to
the
waste
that
they
receive
in
the
first
place--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--because
under
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
only
activities
that
are
referred
to
in
section
3001(i)
are
the
receiving
and
burning
of
the
waste
and
the
recovering
of
energy
from
the
mass
burning.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right,
but
the
only
thing
that
it
says
does
not
amount
to
treating,
storing,
or
disposing,
or
otherwise
managing,
is
the
resource
recovery
facility
recovering
energy
from
the
mass
burning.
that's
the
only
activity
which
is
said
to
be
deemed
not
to
be
management,
and
that's
why
that
facility
does
not
have
to
obtain
a
section
3004--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--under
section...
subsection
1(a),
such
facility
receives
and
burns
only,
and
describes
there.
now,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes,
but
that
is
saying
that
certain
acts
shall
not
be
considered
to
be
treating,
storing,
disposing,
and
we
think
the
act
which
is
not
considered
to
be
treating,
storing,
is
the
recovering
energy
from
the
mass
burning.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
we
think--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right,
and
it's
that
activity
which
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
managing.
now,
of
course,
your
honor,
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
that
distinct
issue
to
rule
in
our
favor,
because
what
we're
claiming
here
is
not
that
they're
treating,
storing,
disposing,
or
otherwise
managing.
we're
claiming
that
they're
violating
the
generator
requirements.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
your
honor,
it
seems
quite
clear
to
us
that
if
the
city
changed
the
nature
of
their
facility
and
said,
well,
this
isn't
just
going
to
be
a
resource
recovery
facility,
this
is
now
going
to
be
a
landfill
disposal
facility,
that
they
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
section
3001(i),
that
congress
was
not,
in
intending
to
promote
resource
recovery
facilities
by
exempting
from
3004,
allowing
the
city
to
put
a
different
kind
of
facility
there,
such
as
a
disposal
facility.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
only
thing
that
3001(i)
addressed
was
an
exemption--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
i
think...
your
honor,
i
think
the
language
was
quite
clear,
and
in
all
events
the
language
was
quite
clear
that
in
no
event
are
they
entitled
to
any
exemption
from
the
generator
requirements,
and
in
no
event
is
any
other
kind
of
facility
entitled--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--your
honor,
i...
in
terms
of
receiving
it,
we
believe
that
there
is
enough
language
in
the
statute
to
support
the
notion
that
if
they're
doing
that
because--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
we
think
that...
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago
that
we
have
an
elaboration
upon
the
receiving...
your
honor,
if
this
court
were
to
rule
that
they
weren't
entitled
to
the
exemption,
either,
which
is
an
issue
not
presented
in
this
case,
i
would
probably
have
to
talk
to
my
client,
and
maybe
they
might
agree
with
that
reading.
that
is
not,
however,
the
position
that
is
raised
in
this
case,
and
is
not
the
contention
that
we're
addressing.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
i
would
not
object
to
this
court
giving
section
3001(i)
a
narrow
reading.
the
fact
is,
there
is
a
settled
canon
of
statutory
construction
in
this
court
which
we
think
is
applicable
here,
and
that
is
when
we're
talking
about
a
remedial
statute,
that
exemptions
of
the
remedial
statute
should
be
narrowly
and
not
broadly
construed.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
i
think
in
this
case,
when
you
have
a
statute
designed
to
protect
human
health
and
the
natural
environment,
that
is
the
paradigmatic
case
of
remedial
statute.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
