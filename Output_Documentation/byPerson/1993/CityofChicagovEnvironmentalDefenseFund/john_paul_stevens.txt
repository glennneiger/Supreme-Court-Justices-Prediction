john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just...
maybe
it's
in
the
papers
and
i
just
forgot
it.
how
many
of
these
facilities
are
there
in
the
country
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
the
epa
ever
proceeded
against
any
of
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just...
the
chemistry
and
the
amounts
involved
are
hard
for
me
to
follow,
but
i
assume
there
is
some
hazardous
waste
in
the
incoming
stream
of
waste
that
is
exempt,
and
you
agree
that
that's
exempt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
assume
that
the
process
of
incineration
produces
a
new
ash
that
contains
no
larger
percentage
of
hazardous
materials
than
the
incoming
stream,
would
they
then
be
subject
to
subchapter
c?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
they
have
not
enhanced
the
hazardous
percentage
of
the
total
amount
of
garbage
processed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
inevitable,
then,
that
no
matter
what
they
do,
that
because
they
start
with
some
hazardous
waste,
they're
going
to
end
up
with
some
hazardous
waste?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
they
could
do
something
better,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
just,
even
doing
what
they
do,
which
is
not
the
best,
as
i
understand
it,
do
they
increase
the
ratio
of
hazardous
to
nonhazardous
waste
in
the
stream
of
garbage
that
they
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
that's
not
legally
required,
but
you
say
they
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
those
terms
just
modify
the
word,
recovery
facility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
modifiers
describing
what
kind
of
recovery
facility
shall
not
be
deemed--
