chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
92-1639,
the
city
of
chicago
v.
the
environmental
defense
fund.
mr.
rosenthal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
broad
is
this
principle
of
which
you
speak,
mr.
rosenthal,
that
congress
is
deemed
to
approve
existing
administrative
construction
when
it
legislates?
i
take
it
it's
when
it
legislates
about
the
precise
matter
with
which
the
administrative
construction
dealt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
first
answer
my
question,
will
you,
before
commenting
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
aren't
you
confusing
ratifying
with
clarifying?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
say,
if
congress
says
we're
clarifying
something,
that
suggests
that
the
meaning
may
have
been
indeterminate
before,
and
that
congress
may
be
giving
it
at
least
a
partially
new
meaning,
whereas
if
you
say
ratifying,
that
means
that
congress
is
approving
the
previous
administrative
construction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rosenthal.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
this
situation
a
little
bit
different
from
chevron?
here
what
was
issued
was
an
interpretive
bulletin,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
reading
from
the
beginning
of
3001(i)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
lazarus,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lazarus,
did
you
bring
this
lawsuit...
did
your
organization?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
were
concerned
about
the
private
landfill
operator,
why
didn't
you
join
the
private
landfill
operator?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
good
does
that
do
the
city,
if
it's
as
narrow
as
you
say?
they're
obviously
not
going
to
store
the
stuff
right
in
the
rcra
itself.
they're
going
to
have
to
dispose
of
it
somewhere.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they
reach
the
rcra
segregated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
kind
of
ash
that
proves
to
be
hazardous,
does
the
metal
that
makes
up
that
come
separately
to
the
rcra
from
the
household
ash?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
city's
argument
that
when
congress
legislates
it's
presumed
to
have
ratified
a
prior
administrative
construction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
the
term,
mixture?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
these?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
yellow
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
just
cited?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
don't
give
the
text
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
do
we
tell
a
remedial
statute
from
a
nonremedial
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
mr.
rosenthal,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenthal.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-1639,
city
of
chicago
versus
environmental
defense
fund
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
