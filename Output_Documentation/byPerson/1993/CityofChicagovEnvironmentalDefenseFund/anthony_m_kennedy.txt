justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
statute,
counsel,
has
two
definitions,
a
definition
of
disposal,
and
a
definition
of
hazardous
waste
generation.
in
your
view,
are
these
discrete
categories
or
is
there
some
overlap
between
the
two?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me...
let
me
put
it
this
way...
that
it's
essential
to
your
case
to
show
that
the
facility
that
treats
the
household
waste
is
disposing
of
the
waste
when
it
stores
the
ash
on-site,
or
when
it
ships
it
off,
but
then
in
other
instances,
other
facilities
would
be
said
to
be
generating
a
hazardous
waste
when
it
did
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
hazardous
waste
generation
is
also
a
defined
term,
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
your
argument
takes
that
into
account,
or
that
if
it
does,
your
position
must
be
that
one
of
these
exempt
facilities
can
be
said
to
be
disposing
of
wastes
when
other
facilities
would
be
generating
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
that
there's
an
overlap
between
what
the
statute
treats
as
two
discrete
categories.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
had
another
facility
that
was
not
exempt,
it
would
be
proper
for
the
government
to
say
that
the
creation
of
the
ash
was
hazardous
waste
generation,
would
it
not?
in
other
words,
it's
only
because
of
this
particular
construction
that
you
give
to
the
exemption
that
the
term,
hazardous
waste
generation,
seems
to
become
irrelevant.
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
can
do
that
consistent
with
the
statutory
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
the
government,
or
the
petitioner
speak
correctly,
then,
when
it
says
that
you
would
not
challenge
the
legitimacy
of
the
storage
of
the
ash
on
the
resource
recovery
facility's
site?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
the
ash
were
stored
on
site,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
act--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
would
be
outside
the
exemption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
at
what
point
does
the
facility
lose
its
exemption
with
respect
to
the
treatment
of
the
waste?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
phrase,
disposing
of,
applies
simply
to
the
waste
that
it
receives
and
not
to
the
ash
that
it
generates.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
city
segregated
the
waste
as
you
suggest
so
that
it
initially
put
the
stuff
in
piles
where
the
more
hazardous
stuff
was
in
one
pile,
and
left
it
there,
and
then
it
started
to
seep
out
into
the
land,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no...
no,
i
have
a
different
hypothetical.
suppose
that
they
take
the
refuse
as
it
comes
to
them
and
separates
it
into
two
piles,
one
pile
has
a
lot
of
the
hazardous
stuff
in
it,
and
it
just
lets
that
pile
sit
for
6,
8
months.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
act,
or
are
they
within
the
exemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
it
about
the
statute
that
triggers
the
loss
of
the
exemption
when
the
ash
is
created?
what
are
the
words
that
you
want
me
to
look
to?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
it
talks
about
treating,
storing,
disposing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--tell
me
where
i'm
supposed
to--
--is
the
subject
of
the
activity--
--where
it
says,
receives
and
burns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
subject
of
the--
--no,
but
that
describes
the
facility,
not
the
act.
the
acts
are,
treating,
storing,
disposing,
otherwise
managing.
