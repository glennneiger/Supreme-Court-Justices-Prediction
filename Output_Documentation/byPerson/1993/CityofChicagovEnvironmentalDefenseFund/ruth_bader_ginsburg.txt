mr.
rosenthal,
one
question
about
this
chronology.
at
what
point
did
the
testing
occur
that
showed
that
there
was
a
risk
of
contamination
to
groundwater
because
the
residue
might
leach
out
of
the
landfill?
that
was
not...
that
testing
occurred,
didn't
it,
after
this
original
epa
regulation
that
you
say
drives
the
whole...
first
the
regulation,
and
then
the
statute,
and
then
epa's
subsequent
interpretation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
did
that
occur
chronologically?
was
it
after
the
original
epa
regulation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
was
it
appreciated
that
the
ash,
as
distinguished
from
the
household
waste
that
went
to
the
incinerator,
would
have
hazardous
potential?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
answer
is
that
the
testing
occurred
after
that
initial
exclusion,
not
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
legislative
report
did
include
both
words,
did
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
couple
of
times,
referring
to
the
landfill,
you
said
the
fortuity
that
the
city
didn't
own
the
landfill,
is
that...
is
it
common
that
the
landfill
is
independently
owned
and
operated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
isn't
it
crucial
to
the
city
to
know
whether
they
have
to
pay
$453
a
ton
to
the
landfill?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
though,
i
take
it
that
what
you
said
is,
well,
to
decide
this
case,
you
can
leave
it
hanging
whether
that
$453
price
tag
has
to
be
picked
up
by
the
city
of
chicago.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear--
--but
the
landfill
has
to
be
paid
by
somebody,
and
that
somebody
is
the
city
of
chicago.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lazarus,
the
difference
between
that
$42
a
ton
price
tag
and
$453
is
enormous.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
these
would
be
economically
feasible
operations
if
the
disposal
had
to
be
in
accordance
with
subchapter
c?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
of
state
regulation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
lazarus,
you're
not
questioning
that
epa
originally
in
1980
had
a
wastestream
exemption?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
silently
changed
what
had
been
a
wastestream
exemption
into
a
facility
exemption.
