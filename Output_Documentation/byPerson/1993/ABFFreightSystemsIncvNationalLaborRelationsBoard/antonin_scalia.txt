justice

scalia
do
federal
courts
deny
people
relief
because
of
perjured
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
that
discretion?
can
i,
as
a
judge,
even
though
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
judgment
in
the
case,
say,
"you're
entitled
to
judgment
but
i'm
not
going
to
give
it
to
you
because
you
perjured
yourself
here.
"
can
a
federal
judge
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
he
might
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
might
not
be,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
know,
in
other
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
prevented
from
discharging
the
employee
now
because
of
the
dishonesty
that
you
learned
he
has
engaged
in,
that
you
now
know
he
has
engaged
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
the
board
would
have
some
problem
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jansonius,
you're
willing
to
settle
for
a
standoff,
aren't
you?
aren't
you
willing
to
say,
okay,
we
both
lied,
and
neither
one
of
us
should
get
any
relief?
isn't
the
difference
that
the
other
liar
is
getting
relief?
your
client's
not
getting
any
relief
from
the
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
even
if
they
are
both
lying,
all
you're
asking
is
that
both
liars
be
treated
equally.
neither
one
of
them
gets
any
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
giving
relief
to
the
side
that's
lying,
and
in
giving
relief
to
nobody
at
all.
yes,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
you
wouldn't
be
evenhanded?
you
would
not
argue
for
the
same
rule
if
the
employer
was
seeking
relief
from
the
board
and
the
employer
lied?
you'd
say,
if
employers
lie
they
can
get
relief,
but
if
employees
lie,
they
cannot
get
relief?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
treat
the
employer
evenhandedly?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
were
seeking
relief
from
the
board
and
it
was
shown
that
the
employer
perjured
himself,
you
wouldn't
give
the
employer
relief,
either,
or
at
least
not
the
kind
of
relief
that's
equivalent
to
the
backpay
and
rehiring
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
courts
of
equity,
mr.
jansonius?
do
you
think
a
court
of
equity
which
has
various
forms
of
relief
available
couldn't
say,
we're
going
to
give
one
form
of
relief
rather
than
another
because
you
affronted
the
court
by
perjuring
yourself?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
a
court
of
equity
would
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
other
federal
agencies
are
there
besides
the
labor
board
that
have
such
a
variety
of
remedies,
varieties
of
forms
of
relief
that
they
can
give
in
a
particular
proceeding?
i
mean,
it's
not
like
the
usual
litigation
where
you
find
for
the
plaintiff
and
give
him
his
damages
or
you
don't.
the
board
has
a
lot
of
varieties
of
relief
it
can
give.
are
there
are
a
lot
of
other
federal
agencies
that
are
in
that
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
thought
that
your
point
was
that
the
board
used
to
do
it
the
way
that
you
now
suggest,
and
it
didn't
seem
to
slow
down
the
proceedings
very
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
an
abuse
of
discretion...
arbitrary,
capricious,
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law,
as
the
apa
says,
and
the
contention
here
is
that
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion,
i
gather,
substantially.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
is
there
any
doubt
that
the
lie
told
here
in
this
legal
proceeding,
of
which
this
is
the
last
stage,
the
court
of
appeals
being
the
intermediate
stage...
is
there
any
doubt
that
it
was
perjury,
a
felony
under
federal
law?
there's
no
real
doubt
about
that,
that
it
was
material
to
the
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
material
to
the
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
find
it...
to
my
mind
it
is.
i
just
don't
think
there's
much
of
a
doubt
about
it,
and
with
that
in
mind,
i
am
just
astounded...
i
never
thought
i
would
read
a
justice
department
brief
in
those
circumstances
which
says
a
lie,
uttered
by
an
employee
trapped
in
these
somewhat
unusual
circumstances
may
be
reasonably
be
characterized
as
less
deserving
of
sanction
than
a
lie
given
by
an
employee
who
has
not
endured
a
similar
history
of
mistreatment
by
the
employer,
and
the
employee's
adherence
to
his
story
before
the
alj...
the
felony...
though
unjustifiable...
felonies
are
unjustifiable...
is
understandable.
will
this
be
posted,
require
to
be
posted
in
the
employee's
place
of
employment
when
this...
when
this
perjurer
is
compelled
to
be
rehired
so
that
everyone
who
goes
to
nlrb
proceedings
will
understand
how
understanding
the
board
and
the
justice
department
is
of
perjury
in
nlrb
proceedings?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
justice
department
also
says
in
its
brief
that
"the
board,
however,
has
discretion
in
determining
how
best
to
protect
its
integrity
while
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
act.
"
what
about
the
courts'
integrity,
who
ultimately
permit
the
enforcement
of
these
orders?
do
you
think
it's
no
imposition
upon
the
integrity
of
the
courts
who
must
accept
the
factfinding
proceedings
held
by
the
nlrb?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
granting
this
remedy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
light
of
the
other
remedies
that
were
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
this
particular
individual
who
had
perjured
himself
in
the
course
of
the
court's
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
also
a
public
dimension,
is
there
not,
mr.
wallace,
to
being
understanding
of
perjury
in
the
course
of
nlrb
proceedings.
does
that
have
no
public
dimension,
either?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
so?
why
couldn't
we
just
say
that
when
the
board
does
make
that
determination,
when
the
board
says
for
all
the
world
to
see,
this
plaintiff
is
a
perjurer,
the
board
shall
not
then
go
on
to
say,
and
we're
going
to
require
the
company
to
give
him
his
job
back...
without
requiring
the
board
to
make
that
determination,
but
if
it
makes
the
determination
and
announces
publicly
that
the
person
seeking
relief
is
a
perjurer,
why
is
it
unreasonable
to
say,
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion,
to
then
go
on
and
say,
and
we're
going
to
give
him
relief?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so,
but
it's
a
question
of
whether
it
fulfills
the
purposes
of
the
act.
once
that
announcement
has
been
made
on
the
record,
whether
it
fulfills
the
purpose
of
the
act
then
to
reinstate
the
person
in
his
employment,
who
then
can
strut
around
and
say,
yes,
i
lied
in
my
proceeding...
didn't
hurt
me
a
bit.
i
got
reinstated.
i
got
my
money
back.
does
that
fulfil
the
purpose
of
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
difference
is
that
the
board
is
not
giving
any
relief
to
the
other
liar.
i'm
not
asking
that
the
board
go
around
punishing
liars.
i'm
just
asking
that
it
not
give
relief--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
i
don't...
do
you
contend
that
the
board
did
not
accept
the
district
judge's
finding
that
this
story
was
a
fabrication?
the
board's
opinion
refers
to
manso's
story...
the
respondent
checked
his
story
and
ascertained
it
was
largely
a
fabrication,
and
later
in
the
board's
opinion
it
refers
to
"manso's
false
explanation".
this
is
the
same
explanation
he
gave
before
the
administrative
law
judge,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
isn't
a
perjury
indictment
for
everyone...
i
mean,
it's
such
a
massive
sanction.
nobody's
going
to
prosecute
manso
for
this
perjury,
even
though
it's
been
found
by
the
administrative
law
judge.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
available,
but
it's
just
not
usable,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
it
turned
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
seem
so
at
the
time.
it
looked
quite
central
when
the
lie
was
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
at
least
preserve
the
apparent
integrity
of
the
system
of
justice
by
not
announcing
that
you
are
making
an
award
to
a
perjurer.
isn't
that
a
very
sensible
rule?
don't
make
a
finding
of
perjury
and
then
give
an
award
to
the
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
board
could
live
with
that,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
three
don't
agree
with
one
another
as
to
what
it
means,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
different
about
the
board
here
is
that
the
relief
is
discretionary.
they
don't
have
to
give
this
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
find
the
employer
guilty
and
give
some
other
kind
of
relief
or,
indeed,
no
relief
at
all,
i
suppose.
