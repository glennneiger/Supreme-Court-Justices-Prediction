no,
but
it's
a
question
of,
are...
the
authority
we
can
exercise
over
the
board.
even
assuming,
for
the
moment,
that
the
rule
you
suggest
has
some
merit
to
it,
don't
you
have
to
tell
us
that
the
board
is
arbitrary
in
not
adopting
that
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
else
can
we
reverse
the
board's
determination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
the
legal
proposition
that
you're
putting
forth
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
arbitrary
if
it
fails
to
adopt
a
rule
that
refuses
relief
to
any
employee
who
lies...
lies,
i
suppose,
on
a
material
matter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
lear-siegler
the
board
was
upset
that
an
employee
that...
had
manipulated
a
witness,
and
the
board
was
very
protective
of
its
own
turf,
saying
that
you've
interfered
with
our
processes,
but
in
owens
illinois
the
board
awarded
reinstatement
to
a
line
employee
because
the
employer
had
not
demonstrated
that
the
employee
was
unfit,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you
give
very
little
consideration
to
the
injury
that
the
employer
faces
when
the
employer
has
to
mount
the
burden
of
proving
perjury,
which
the
employer
in
this
case
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
there
were
an
applicant
for
employment
with
the
department
of
justice
and
it
was
known
that
he
committed
the
felony
of
perjury,
would
you
say,
oh,
well,
we
have
to
counsel
that
there's
been
no
conviction
here,
if
all
conceded
that
there
had
been
a
felony
committed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
the
employer
entitled
to
take
it
just
as
seriously
in
his
workplace?
