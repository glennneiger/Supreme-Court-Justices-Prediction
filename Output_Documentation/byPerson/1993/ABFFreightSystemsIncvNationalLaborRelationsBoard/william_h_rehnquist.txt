we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
92-1550,
abf
freight
system
v.
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
jansonius.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
point
out
one
likely
difficulty
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
rule,
mr.
jansonius?
it
would
complicate
the
procedures
before
the
alj
and
the
board,
because
you'd
have
a
lot
of
what
you
might
call
satellite
litigation,
or
at
least
satellite
determinations.
you
know,
much
concentration
on
was
this
particular
witness
lying,
or
was
he
merely
mistaken,
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jansonius.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
this
case,
isn't
it
true
that
the
alj
stated
that
the
person
lied?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
mr.
wallace,
the
board
didn't
make
any
finding
that
this
particular
individual
had
lied,
as
i
recall.
as
you
point
out,
the
administrative
law
judge
made
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
jansonius,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jansonius.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
92-1550,
abf
freight
systems
versus
nlrb,
the
national
labor
relations
board
found
that
petitioner
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
as
a
remedy
for
the
wade
violation,
the
board
ordered
the
petitioner,
who
is
an
employer,
to
reinstate
one
of
its
former
employees
with
backpay.
the
administrative
law
judge
had
found
that
the
employee
had
given
certain
false
testimony
on
an
issue
that
turned
out
to
be
not
material
to
the
board's
decision.
the
ourt
of
appeals
enforced
the
board's
order
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
the
employee's
false
testimony
should
have
precluded
the
board
from
granting
him
relief.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
of
the
court
uttered
by
justice
stevens,
we
hold
that
the
board
acted
within
the
discretion
granted
to
it
by
the
statute,
and
therefore,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justice
o'connor.
