what
if
a
representative
of
management
of
the
employer
lies
under
oath
at
the
nlrb
proceeding?
what's
the
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
it
turns
out
that,
notwithstanding
what
clearly
was
a
lie
on
some
point,
that
the
employer
is
entitled
to
judgment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
the
law
and
the
facts,
the
company
should
prevail.
what
must
be
done
there?
must
relief
be
denied
under
your
rule,
a
per
se
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
wouldn't
suggest
a
per
se
rule
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this:
did
this
employer
introduce
evidence
that
under
every
circumstance,
if
they
had
an
employer
they
discovered
who
had
lied,
the
employer
would
be
discharged,
that
that
was
the
rule
of
the
employer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
we
take
this
case,
the
employee
was
not
discharged
for
dishonesty
but
for
other
things.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
how
it
comes
to
us,
anyway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
i
mean,
we
take
it
on
that
basis,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
employer's
rule
is
that
any
employee
who
commits
a
felony
is
not
eligible
for
continued
employment
with
us,
and
perjury
is
a
felony.
that's
our
rule.
now,
does
the
board
take
that
into
account?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
my
question
didn't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--didn't
refer
to
convictions.
it
said
felons,
people
who
commit
felonies
will
no
longer
be
employees
of
ours,
and
here
we
have
a
finding
of
perjury,
in
effect.
