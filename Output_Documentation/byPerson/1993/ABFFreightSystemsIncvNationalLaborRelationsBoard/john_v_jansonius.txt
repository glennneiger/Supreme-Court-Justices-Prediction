mr.
john
v.
jansonius
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
remedies
in
unfair
labor
practices
are
public
remedies.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
individual
who
testifies
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
under
oath,
and
who
testifies
untruthfully,
may
share
in
the
remedy
that
may
be
entered
at
the
conclusion
of
that
proceeding.
this
case
was
filed
as
a
consolidated
case
involving
several
dockworkers
who
worked
for
abf
freight
system
in
albuquerque.
ironically,
the
only
one
of
those
dockworkers
to
prevail
in
this
case
is
mr.
michael
manso.
mr.
manso
was
discharged
on
august
17,
1989,
ostensibly
for
being
late
for
work
that
day.
at
the
hearing
in
albuquerque,
he
testified
as
to
the
reason
he
was
late
for
work.
he
said
that
his
car
had
broken
down
on
the
way
in,
that
he'd
had
to
call
his
wife
and
that
she
came
and
picked
him
up
and
then
took
him
on
to
work,
at
which
time
he
was
pulled
over
by
a
highway
patrolman.
the
judge
heard
all
that
testimony,
and
the
judge
concluded
that
mr.
manso
was
lying
in
testifying
as
to
his
reason
for
being
late
for
work
that
day.
in
an
adversary
system
for
resolving
disputes,
we
believe
that
the
oath
that
a
witness
takes
is
absolutely
vital,
that
it's
fundamental
to
the
process.
the
first
step
to
correctly
applying
the
law
is
to
decide
the
facts
correctly
in
the
first
place,
and
a
witness
who
does
not
honor
the
oath
makes
that
process
much
more
difficult
for
the
courts
and
in
this
case
for
the
administrative
law
judge.
perhaps
more
than
in
any
other
context
in
the
federal
system
a
correct
outcome
on
the
facts
in
unfair
labor
practice
cases
is
dependent
on
witnesses
honoring
their
oaths.
whether
or
not
a
complaint
is
even
to
be
filed
in
the
first
instance
is
normally
decided
by
counsel
for
the
general
counsel
or
by
the
regional
offices
of
the
nlrb
simply
based
on
affidavits.
individuals
who
give
statements
to
the
nlrb's
are
under
oath,
and
their
statements
are
taken
at
face
value
for
the
most
part,
and
whether
or
not
there
is
even
going
to
be
a
case
depends
on
whether
that
individual
is
giving
a
true
affidavit.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
they
have
that
discretion,
your
honor.
they
don't
necessarily
do
it.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
where
an
individual
who
has
been
found
to
have
testified
untruthfully
to
a
federal
district
judge
has
been
awarded
relief.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
in
a
particular
context
a
federal
judge
might
be
able
to
do
that.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
situation--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--might
be.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
might
not
be,
your
honor.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
i
do
know
the
unfair
labor
practice,
though,
followed
by
the
nlrb,
and
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
it's
particularly
important
that
the
oath
be
honored.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
well,
the--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--if
i'm
following,
you're
saying
what
is
the
situation
if
the
representative
of
management
testifies--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--untruthfully--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--and
the
company
nonetheless
prevails
in
the
case?
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
i
think
there
are
two
possibilities.
number
1,
if
there
has
been
no
unfair
labor
practice,
i'm
not
certain
that
the
nlrb
has
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
about
it.
i
do
think
that,
assuming
that
they
do
have
jurisdiction,
that
they
have
remedial
power
that
they
could
craft
a
remedy
in
that
situation,
that
they
could
deal
with
it.
they,
for
instance,
could
make
the
employer
post
a
notice
explaining
to
employees
what
they
did
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
they
could
be
perhaps
required
to
give
a
union
representative
equal
time
to
come
into
the
plant,
tell
the
employees,
we
had
an
unfair
labor
practice
case,
we
lost
in
that
unfair
labor
practice
case,
here's
why,
but
you
must
know
that
the
employer
did
so-and-so.
there
are
a
variety
of
remedies
that
i
think
the
nlrb
would
have
in
that
situation,
assuming
it
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
well,
i
might,
your
honor,
presented
with
the
situation.
i'm
not
aware
of
that
situation
coming
before
us.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
that
specific
evidence
was
not
presented,
but
the
evidence
was
presented
in
the
sense
that
it's
in
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
dishonesty
is
grounds
for
immediate
termination,
so
certainly
the
collective
bargaining
representatives,
or
the
union
representatives
and
the
management
representatives
who
negotiated
the
contract
felt
that
dishonesty
was
a
serious
offense.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
that's
true.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
that's
true,
and
the...
i
will
tell
you
that
the
evidence
on
that
point
was
somewhat
equivocal,
and
that
may
be--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--yes,
you
do.
yes--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--i
think
we
could,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
how
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
applies
in
that
situation,
whether
that
would
be
a
contractual
issue
between
abf
and
its
union
representatives.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
i'm
sure
they
would
have
some
problem
with
it,
but
i
think
we
would
be
legally
justified
in
terminating
him.
the
contractual
issue
is
one
i'm
not
familiar
with
on
the
procedures
under
the
national
master.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
your
honor,
i
don't
think
he
made
that
finding.
he
did
discredit
some
of
the
employer's
witnesses
on
some
comments
that
supposedly
were
made
when
mr.
manso
returned
to
work
on
one
occasion.
he
used
much
stronger
language
in
characterizing
mr.
manso's
testimony,
and
i
think
there
was
a
reason
for
that.
it
was
very
clear
that
mr.
manso
was
not
just
mistaken
on
the
facts
or
had
a
faulty
memory.
he
was
contriving
a
story
that
was
not
true.
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--well,
there
could
be
a
number
of
explanations
for
it.
they
could
simply
have
forgotten.
it
could
be
a
statement
that
was
blown
out
of
context.
it
might
be
something
that
their
memory
of
the
event
differs
from
mr.
manso's
memory
of
the
event.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
necessarily
that
because
a
witness'
testimony
is
not
credited
that
they're
being
deliberately
untruthful.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
well,
i
don't
think
you
can
make
that
assumption
that
they're
lying,
because
the
events
that
had
occurred
were
months
in
advance
of
that.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
he
is
saying
that.
he's
saying
that.
i
don't
think
he's
saying
that
they
have
come
into
the
courtroom
and
deliberately
given
false
testimony.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
well--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--well,
that's
true--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--i
would
be
satisfied
with
that.
i
don't
like
the
equation,
though,
that
our
witnesses
lied,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
say--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--that
they
were
speaking
for
the
corporation.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
i
agree
with
that,
and
the
fact
is
that
we
are
not
contesting
the
total
award
entered
by
the
nlrb.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
your
question,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--well,
it's
not
a
liability
issue.
we
have
lost
the
case,
technically.
we're
not
contesting--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--just
on
the
remedy.
we
are
not
contesting
at
this
stage,
any
more,
the
finding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
being
committed.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
though,
that--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--oh,
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
yes.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
no,
i
wouldn't.
i
think
that
sometimes
employers
are
charging
parties
in
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
it's
not
very
often,
but
they
sometimes
are,
and
if
they
do
go
in
and
abuse
the
process,
i
don't
think
they
should
be
given
relief.
you
have
a
little
tougher
issue
with
employers,
though,
and
it's
because
sometimes
the...
it's
not
the
officers,
directors,
or
the
shareholders
of
the
corporation
who
are
acting,
but
individuals
who
are
testifying
on
behalf
of
the
company.
you
just
do
not--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--i
don't
think
you
would,
you
honor.
we're
not
asking
the
administrative
law
judges
to
change
the
way
they
go
about
deciding
cases.
they...
they
are
normally
very
judicious.
they
normally
refrain
from
making
those
strong
determinations.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
well,
the
employee
has
a
choice
to
make.
they
can
go
in
and
tell
the
truth,
or
they
can
go
in
and
tell
a
lie.
i
think--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--i
don't
think
we
have
to
prove
arbitrariness,
although
i
think
it
exists
here.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
well,
under
the
statute,
i
guess
the
issue
is
whether
awarding
relief,
reinstatement
and
backpay
to
somebody
who
has
deliberately
given
false
testimony
will
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
yes.
i
believe
that
it
is
an
arbitrary
position,
if
not
just
an
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
position,
for
the
nlrb
to
state
that
someone
who
abuses
the
process
by
coming
in
and
giving
false
testimony
is
entitled
to
backpay
and
reinstatement,
and
that
doing
that
will
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
i
don't
see
how
the
board
can
make
that
case
that
putting
somebody
back
to
work,
giving
them
backpay
in
this
situation,
is
going
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act,
and
i
think
that
is
why
the
congress
assigned
this
court
with
supervisory
responsibility
over
the
board.
there
have
been
many
instances
over
the
years
where
this
court
looked
at
nlrb
remedies
and
made
the
conclusion
that
what
the
nlrb
did
perhaps
ran
afoul
or
interfered
with
other
federal
policies
and
corrected
the
board
on
the
remedy
that
it
entered,
and
this
is
one
of
those
situations
where
i
believe
that
is
appropriate.
i
think
it's
particularly
appropriate
in
the
nlrb
context,
just
because
of
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
themselves.
we
have
very
few
safeguards
for
truth
in
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings.
the
oath
is
perhaps
one
of
them.
the
board
serves
as
prosecutor,
they
serve
as
judge,
they
serve
as
jury,
they
hear
the
first
level
of
appeal,
there's
no
discovery,
there's
no
way
for
an
employer
like
abf
to
know
in
advance
of
a
hearing
what
the
government's
evidence
is
going
to
be,
who
the
witnesses
are
going
to
be,
what
they're
going
to
say.
you
can't
even
get
statements
from
individuals
who
have
given
affidavits
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
until
they
actually
take
the
stand
at
the
hearing,
and
even
then
only
after
they've
testified.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
the
first
part
of
your
question,
how
many
other
agencies
there
are.
i'm
very
familiar
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
and
in
proceedings
like
this,
if
there
are
other
agencies
that
have
a
similar
adjudicatory
process,
i
think
the
rules
should
apply
to
them.
there
are
very
few
safeguards
for
truth
in
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings,
and
the
oath
in
this
context
is
particularly
important.
an
employer,
or
a
union--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--no.
in
the
civil
litigation
system
i'm
not
aware
of
any
rule
with
that
effect.
i
do
think
it's
the
practical
reality
of
litigation
in
the
federal
district
courts
that
individuals
whose
testimony
is
discredited
on
material
points
don't
prevail.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
yes,
i
think--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--i
think
a
court
of
equity
would
be
in
a
position
to
craft
a
remedy
that's
appropriate
in
this
case.
i
think
the
board--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--your
honor,
i
wish
i
could
answer
that.
i
just
don't
know.
i
do
know
that
the
nlrb
has
very
broad
discretion
and
it
can
craft
remedies.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
no,
i
don't
think
it
slowed
down
proceedings
at
all,
and
i
do
think
at
one
point
in
time
the
board
had
pretty
much
the
attitude
that
i'm
advocating
they
should
take
now,
that
one
who
has
given
false
testimony
is
not
going
to
be
given
a
share
of
the
public
remedy.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
your
honor,
what
compels
the
board
to
take
that
view
is
i
believe,
number
1,
starting
with
section
1
of
the
act
which
sets
out
the
purposes,
i
don't
see
that
reinstating
someone
with
backpay
and
giving
them
money
damages
or
reinstatement
is
going
to
effectuate
any
of
the
purposes
set
out
in
section
1
of
the
act.
i
believe
section
10(c)
of
the
act
makes
some
remedies
nondiscretionary
with
the
board
and
makes
it
clear
that
they
have
to
enter
some
forms
of--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--yes.
i
think
what
really
separates
this
case
from
the
standard
unfair
labor
practice
case
where
the
discretion
has
been
accorded
the
board
to
mold
the
remedies
under
section
10(c)
with
very
little
review
is
the
fact
that
we
do
have
other
policies
that
come
into
play
here.
typically,
the
nlrb
is
deciding
strictly
labor
disputes
that
don't
have
ramifications
that
go
outside
the
national
labor
relations
act
where
the
federal
policies
are
impacted.
this
one
does,
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
here
to
take
a
hand
in
directing
the
board
and
supervising
it,
and
what
remedies
are
to
be
entered
in
this
rather
narrow
context.
but
there's
no
provision
in
the
statute
that
directly
addresses
it,
and
i
can't
imagine
that
congress
really
thought
of
this
situation...
what's
going
to
happen
with
a
charging
party
who
comes
in
and
lies,
and
what
should
the
board
do
then?
congress
was
concerned
when
it
considered
the
national
labor
relations
act
about
the
lack
of
safeguards
for
truth.
when
the
bill
was
originally
considered
in
the
senate,
it
specifically
provided
that
the
rules
of
evidence
were
not
to
apply.
that
was
the
subject
of
some
debate
in
congress,
and
there
was
a
lot
of
testimony
that
this
was...
before
the
congress
at
the
time
that
this
was
not
a
good
policy,
that
the
rules
of
evidence
should
be
applied.
and
after
debating
the
issue,
congress
did
a
turnaround
and
made
section
10...
put
in
section
10(b)
that
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
were
to
be
applied
insofar
as
practicable
in
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings,
and
i
think
that
indicated
that
congress
had
some
concern
with
the
lack
of
safeguards
for
truth
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
context,
and
did
what
they
could
to
see
that
the
oath
was
made
a
part
of
the
process.
your
honors,
through
its
brief,
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
the
nlrb,
that
its
order
in
this
case
does
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
abf
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
government's
attorneys
are
putting
words
in
the
mouth
of
the
nlrb.
there
is
no
finding
in
the
nlrb's
decision
and
order
that
reinstating
mr.
manso
with
backpay
will
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act,
and
there
certainly
is
no
explanation
in
the
board's
decision
and
order
about
how
reinstating
a
witness
who
has
given
false
testimony
is
going
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
i--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--generally
there
is
deference
to
the
board's
expertise
in
handling
labor
disputes
and
taking
actions
that
will
prevent
labor
strife.
i
don't
think
this
is
a
context
where
the
board
has
shown
that
it
has
an
expertise
in
the
subject
matter
at
issue,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
board's
decision
and
order
gives
any
explanation
for
the
court
that
would
enable
you
to
say
that
they
were
acting
properly
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
there
simply
isn't
any
discussion
in
the
decision
and
order
about
how
giving
a
remedy
to
somebody
who
has
given
false
testimony
is
going
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
abf
would
urge
the
court
that,
as
a
strict
proposition,
that
reinstating
someone,
giving
someone
backpay
in
this
context
will
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
there's
a
few
points
i'd
like
to
make
in
that
regard.
first,
as
i
said
in
my
opening
comment,
getting
at
the
true
facts
of
the
case
is
the
first
step
to
correctly
applying
the
law.
if
a
witness
is
not
going
to
honor
the
oath,
that's
going
to
interfere
with
the
nlrb's
and
any
other
agency's
ability
to
get
at
the
true
facts
and
to
correctly
apply
the
law,
so
just
from
a
very
broad
proposition,
a
witness
who
is
not
telling
the
truth
is
undermining
an
agency's
ability
to
enforce
and
protect
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
there
are
other
reasons
as
well
why
i
believe
that
the
board's
order
in
this
case
cannot
possibly
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
just
common
sense
that
putting
someone
like
mr.
manso
back
to
work
is
going
to
be
saddling
abf
with
a
contractual
relationship
with
someone
who
it
has
very
good
grounds
not
to
trust,
and
there's
certainly
going
to
be
a
loss
of
respect
between
the
employer
and
employee,
and
i
don't
think
that
a
working
relationship
with
someone
who
has
taken
advantage
of
the
system
and
the
employer
the
way
mr.
manso
has
could
be
said
to
do
anything
to
reduce
labor
strife
or
to
promote
the
free
flow
of
commerce.
i
think
that
the
act,
the
purposes
of
the
act
are
frustrated
in
this
context
by
encouraging
false
claims.
the
nlrb
is
going
to
look
like
a
very
friendly
forum
to
charging
parties...
and
it
should
be
a
receptive
forum,
i'm
not
saying
that,
otherwise...
but
it's
going
to
look
like
a
system
where
the
government
can
be
taken
advantage
of,
and
i
don't
think
that
effectuates
the
purposes
of
the
act.
i
think
the
remedy
that
the
board
has
ordered
in
this
case
undermines
abf's
collectively
bargained
agreements
procedure.
mr.
manso
went
through
the
agreements
procedure.
a
three...
or
six-member
panel
equally
composed
of
labor
and
management
concluded
that
he
should
not
be
put
back
to
work,
concluded
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
backpay.
given
what's
happened,
i
think
that
the
grievance
committee
that
abf
has
negotiated
with
the
local
union
of
the
teamsters
is
going
to
look
like
a
less
receptive
forum,
and
there's
going
to
be
more
tendency
to
try
and
sidestep
the
grievance
procedure
knowing
that
the
nlrb
is
going
to
be
more
forgiving
of
those
who
try
to
take
advantage
of
the
system.
for
all
those
reasons,
i
think
that
the
board's
order
in
this
case,
or
in
any
similar
context,
is
not
effectuating
the
purposes
of
the
act,
and
again
i
would
say
that
i
think
that
the
nlrb
needs
to
be
reminded
that
it
does
not
apply
the
act
in
a
vacuum.
this
court
has
said
several
times
that
other
considerations
have
to
be
taken
into
account
when
crafting
unfair
labor
practice
remedies.
it
did
so
in
sure-tan,
it
did
so
in
detroit
edison,
it
did
so
in
lechmere,
it's
done
so
in
other
cases.
and
the
nlrb
in
this
case
did
apply
the
act
in
a
vacuum,
it
did
take
a
very
narrow
reading
of
public
policy,
and
looked
strictly
at
the
national
labor
relations
act
instead
of
taking
other
concerns
into
account
which
we
believe
that
they
are
compelled
to
do,
and
we
believe
that
this
court
as
the
supervisor
over
the
nlrb
should
make
it
clear
to
them
that
they've
got
to
take
the
oath
seriously,
that
it
is
a
public
policy
that
it
be
honored,
and
that
should
be
made
a
stronger
part
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
unless
there
are
other
questions
i'll
reserve
my
time.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
just
a
quick
comment
on
chevron,
and
i
realize
i'm
speaking
to
the
author
of
the
opinion
and
a
justice
who
has
written
law
review
articles
on
it,
so
i'll
try
to
be
quick.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
and
that,
too.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
my
point
on
chevron
is
that
i'm
not
sure
that...
at
least
i
wouldn't
want
to
take
for
granted
that
chevron
analysis
applies.
i
think
that
was
a
different
situation.
it
involved
a
very
complex
regulatory
scheme,
it
involved
a
set
of
regulations
that
clearly
were
within
technical
expertise
of
the
administrative
agency,
and
it
involved
a
situation
where
the--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--on
how
the
labor
market
works.
i
don't
think
they've
shown
that
they
have
any
expertise
on
how
the
administration
of
justice
works,
and
that's
really
what
we
see
this
case
as
being,
but
that
was
a
complex
regulatory
scheme
where
the
agency
involved
had
very
carefully
evaluated
the
regulations
in
question
and
explained
why
it
was
doing
what
it
was
doing.
that's
not
the
situation
here,
and
i
guess
i
throw
that
out
only
to
say
that
i
wouldn't
take
for
granted
that
chevron
analysis
applies,
but
even
under
chevron
analysis
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
to
enforce
the
nlrb's
order
was
clearly
incorrect.
mr.
wallace
stated
that
judge
maloney's
finding
about
the
lie
was
gratuitous.
it
wasn't
gratuitous
at
all.
to
those
of
us
who
were
in
the
courtroom,
particularly
those
of
us
who
heard
all
the
evidence,
it
was
very
clear
what
mr.
manso
was
doing.
he
was
trying
to
misuse
the
system
for
personal
gain.
it
was
a
very
clear
attempt
to
shape
the
outcome
of
the
case,
and
that's
why
judge
maloney
felt
compelled
to
use
strong
language.
your
honors,
congress
assigned
to
the
federal
courts
the
power
and
the
responsibility
to
enforce
or
not
to
enforce--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--yes.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
ask
the
alj?
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
yes,
we
did.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
we
most
certainly
did,
and
put
it
in
our
brief...
but
congress
did
assign
to
the
federal
courts
the
responsibility
to
enforce
or
not
to
enforce
decisions
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
congress
also
assigned
to
this
court
the
responsibility
for
drafting
rules
of
evidence,
and
those
rules
of
evidence
are
now
statutory.
none
of
those
rules
of
evidence
has
a
longer
lineage,
none
of
them
is
more
uniformly
applied,
none
of
them
is
less
discretionary
than
the
rule
that--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--exactly.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
nlrb
process
is
certainly
peculiar
enough
that
this
court
can
write
an
opinion
that's
narrow
to
the
context
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
no,
i
think
it's
equally
serious
as
to
both,
but
i
think
the
importance
of
having
a
rule
enforcing
the
oath
is
particularly
important
in
this
context.
when
i'm
in
civil
court--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--well,
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
that--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--the--
mr.
john
v.
jansonius
--certainly.
the
difference
that
i
believe
exists
is
just
in
the
process
itself.
when
we're
in
civil
court
we
have
great
means
to
find
out
the
true
facts
of
the
case,
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
what
happened,
and
to
know
before
we
go
into
the
courtroom
who's
likely
to
tell
the
truth,
who's
not
likely
to
tell
the
truth,
and
how
do
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
true
facts
of
the
case.
we
don't
have
that
in--
