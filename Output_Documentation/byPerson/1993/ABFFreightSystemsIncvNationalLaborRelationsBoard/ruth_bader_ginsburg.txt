why
isn't
this
case
a
standoff
on
lying?
the
alj
found
that
a
couple
of
the
employer's
witnesses
also
lied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
does
that
differ...
there
were
three
officers
who,
according
to
manso,
said,
watch
out,
the
boss
is
gunning
for
you,
and
they
said,
we
never
said
any
such
thing.
now,
if
they
said
that,
why
aren't
they
out-and-out
lying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
--the
alj
says,
"i
believe
manso.
"
"he
said
he
was
told
the
boss
is
gunning
for
you.
"
these
witnesses
have
taken
an
oath
that
that
never
happened.
why
aren't
they
lying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
the
alj
says,
"i
credit
manso",
isn't
he
necessarily
saying,
i
discredit
these
others?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what's
wrong
with
saying
this
answer
on
the
part
of
the
employee,
that
that...
even
if
it's
a
bad
answer,
it's
good
enough
for
a
bad
charge,
because
if
the
lateness
is
a
phony
excuse,
if
the
employer
wants
to
get
rid
of
this
employee
because
he's
been
prounion,
and
then
the
employer
makes
up
as
the
reason
the
lateness,
why
shouldn't
the
employee...
i'm
going
to
try
to
save
my
neck
for
this
bad
charge.
i'm
going
to
give
an
answer
that
will
help
me
stay.
why
should...
why
shouldn't...
the
board's
position
is,
we
have
to
be
sensitive
and
situation-specific
in
our
analysis
of
this.
why
should
you
come
and
say,
"board,
you
must
defend
your
honor
and
anytime
anybody
lies
to
you,
no
relief.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jansonius,
this
would
be
a
rather
sweeping
proposition
if
the
court
were
to
accept
it.
how
many
other
agencies
are
there
like
the
nlrb
who
deal
with
the
truthfulness
of
what
witnesses
say?
are
you
suggesting
that
every
federal
agency
must
take
the
position
that
one
who
doesn't
tell
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
doesn't
get
individual
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
familiar
with
any
such
rule
that
a
trial...
say
trial
judge
is
having
a
bench
trial
and
doesn't
believe
some
of
the
things
the
plaintiff
says,
that
that
judge
must
then
deny
relief
to
the
plaintiff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
also
saying
that
that
is
a
matter
of
law...
maybe
if
the
board
decided
how
it
wanted
to
proceed,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
you
say...
what
compels
the
board
to
take
that
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
taking
us
out
of
the
equity
mold
into
the
strict
law
mold.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
deference
to
the
board's
judgment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--expert
judgment
in
handling
these
labor
problems.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
are
you
reading,
please?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
tells
us
how
the
employer
in
this
institution
has
treated
people
who
don't
tell
the
truth
other...
no
routine
practice.
it
couldn't
fire,
but
don't
necess...
we
don't
know
whether
they
do
or
they
don't,
whether
this
is
one
of
a
kind,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
who
has
reversed
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
have
to
apply
the
same
rule
to
a
district
court,
then,
you
say.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anybody
who
doesn't
tell
the
truth
under
oath
is
not
entitled
to
monetary
remedy?
