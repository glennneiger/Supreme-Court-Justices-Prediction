mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
question
presented
is
a
legal
question
about
the
board's
remedial
authority,
and
as
petitioner
recognizes,
that
remedial
authority
is
a
creature
of
statute.
it's
set
forth
in
section
10(c)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
is
reproduced
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition,
the
white-covered
certiorari
petition,
at
page
c-5
toward
the
very
end
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
it's
a
rather
lengthy
provision,
but
there
are
two
discrete
portions
of
it
that
have
relevance
here.
the
first
is
at
about
ten
lines
down
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence,
beginning
close
to
the
beginning
of
the
line,
"after
the
board
has
found
that
there's
an
unfair
labor
practice
it
ordinarily
issues
a
cease
and
desist
order,
and
it's
authorized
then,
and
to
take
such
affirmative
action,
including
reinstatement
of
employees
with
or
without
backpay,
as....
"
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am
about
ten
lines
down
on
page
c-5.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
about
ten
lines
down
within
subsection
(c):
"the
board
is
authorized
to
take
such
affirmative
action,
including
reinstatement
of
employees
with
or
without
backpay,
as
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
this
act.
"
and
then
about
twelve
lines
from
the
bottom
of
this
provision
there
is
a
sentence
that
begins,
just
past
the
middle
of
the
line,
that
says,
"no
order
of
the
board
shall
require
the
reinstatement
of
any
individual
as
an
employee
who
has
been
suspended
or
discharged
or
the
payment
to
him
of
any
backpay
if
such
individual
was
suspended
or
discharged
for
cause.
"
except
for
that
provision,
one
searches
in
vain
for
an
express
limitation
in
the
statute
on
the
board's
remedial
authority
in
ordering
reinstatement
or
backpay
in
accordance
with
the
board's
judgment
of
what
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
and
in
this
case
there
was
a
determination
made
by
the
board...
on
page
b-21
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
that
this
was
not
a
discharge
for
cause,
that
the
cause
given
was
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
that
finding
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals...
on
pages
a-14
to
a-18
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
and
that
question
is
not
at
issue
here
under
the
court's
limited
grant
of
jurisdiction.
so
the
only
express
limitation
in
the
statute
that
the
courts
obviously
would
have
to
consider
enforcing
against
the
board
in
limiting
its
remedial
authority
is
not
applicable
here,
and
the
question
becomes,
as
justice
kennedy
very
aptly
phrased
it
in
his
question,
whether
the
board
was
arbitrary
in...
has
been
arbitrary
in
the
standards
it
has
adopted
in
determining
when
reinstatement
and
backpay
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
has
formulated
it
in
numerous
ways,
many
of
which
we
collected
in
our
brief.
the
first
decision
of
this
court
dealing
specifically
with
the
question
of
reinstatement
was
the
1941
decision,
written
by
justice
frankfurter
for
the
court
in
the
phelps
dodge
case,
and
we
have
set
out
a
relevant
quotation
from
that
on
the
very
last
page
of
our
brief,
in
which
the
court
upheld
in
that
case
the
board's
authority
to
order
reinstatement
as
a
remedy
for
employees
who
had
found
other
employment
and
were
not
entitled
to
backpay.
the
court
emphasized
that
because
the
relation
of
remedy
to
policy,
which
is
the
statutory
criterion,
is
peculiarly
a
matter
for
administrative
competence,
courts
must
not
enter
the
allowable
area
of
the
board's
discretion
and
must
guard
against
the
danger
of
sliding
unconsciously
from
the
narrow
confines
of
law
into
the
more
spacious
domain
of
policy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
was
found
to
be
purposeful--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--by
the
administrative
law
judge,
and
the
board
expressed
no
disagreement
with
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
mr.
justice,
we
certainly
would
not
disclaim
the
authority
to
prosecute
for
perjury
in
this
case
or
any
other,
and
we
have
collected
cases
in
our
brief
in
which
the
board
has
referred
matters
to
the
justice
department
for
prosecution...
this
is
on
page...
footnote
19
on
page
27
of
our
brief...
when
there
has
been
perjury
in
proceedings
before
the
board,
and
as
there
are
remedies
for
perjury
which
do
not
require
distortion
of
the
board's
remedial
authority
in
deciding
what
the
appropriate
remedy
is
for
a
proven
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
something
of
that
flavor
comes
through
in
the
precision
window
opinion,
which
said
that
the
board
is
not
entitled...
the
board
is
barred
from
awarding
reinstatement
or
backpay
to...
in
favor
of
a
charging
party
who
has
lied
in
the
proceedings
before
the
board.
i
would
mention,
however,
that
the
court
did
not
take
the
position
that
it
was
barred
from
upholding
the
board's
entry
of
a
cease
and
desist
order.
the
question
ultimately
has
to
be
whether
the
board
acted
beyond
its
authority.
that
is
all
the
court
is
being
asked
to
determine
when
the
question
before
the
reviewing
court
is
whether
to
enforce
the
board's
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
particular
rem--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--whether
the
remedy
should
have
been
a
more
limited
one.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
the
board
recognized
in
the
same
phelps
dodge
case
back
in
1941
with
respect
to
reinstatement,
and
as
this
court
has
emphasized
in
that
case
and
in
the
golden
state
case
much
more
recently,
there
is
a
public
dimension
to
this
relief.
this
is
not
relief
just
for
an
individual.
the
reinstatement
remedy
in
particular,
as
the
board
emphasized
in
phelps
dodge,
is
one
that
reassures
other
present
and
future
employees
of
the
same
employer
that
discrimination
based
on
antiunion
animus
or
protected
conduct
under
the
act
will
be
remedied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
many
credibility
determinations
to
be
made
in
labor
board
proceedings.
it
is
not
always
clear,
as
this
court's
opinion
last
term
in
st.
mary's
honor
center
very
eloquently
and
emphatically
pointed
out,
that
every
determination
that
the
credibility
of
one
witness
rather
than
another
is
to
be
upheld
means
that
the
witness
whose
credibility
is
not
being
honored
has...
is
a
liar
or
a
perjurer,
has
deliberately
told
a
lie
rather
than
misrecollected
something
or
was
confused
about
something.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
this
case
it
happened
to
be
an
easy
determination
because
this
particular
story
had
earlier
been
told
to
the
employer
and
the
employer
had
investigated
it
and
disproved
it.
it
happened
to
be
something
that
could
easily
be
determined
in
this
particular
case.
but
my
point
is
a
point
that
you
yourself
made
in
a
question
earlier,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
it
becomes
a
legally
dispositive
question
whether
a
rejection
of
a
witness'
testimony
is
based
on
a
determination
that
that
witness
was
deliberately
lying,
then
the
other
party
in
the
case
can
ask
the
board
to
make
that
determination--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
every
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
since
there
was
no...
it
has
a
gratuity
in
the
determination
of
the
case
to
have
made
that
pronouncement,
or
if
it's
a
legally
important
determination,
others
could
ask
that
it
be
determined
in
other
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
board
is
quite
conscious
of
the
need
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
processes,
and
as
the
lear-siegler
case
which
we
discussed
at
some
length,
demonstrates,
it
has
on
occasion,
using
its
standards,
tolled
backpay
when
there
has
been
misconduct
in
the
board
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
precisely
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
precisely
so,
because
the
board
did
not
consider
it
determinative
of
what
the
appropriate
remedy
should
be.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board
does
make
a
distinction
between
backpay
and
reinstatement.
it
will
toll
backpay
it
there
has
been
misconduct
or
misuse
of
its
proceedings
as
a
means
of
protecting
the
integrity
of
its
proceedings,
but
it
explained
in
lear-siegler
that
that
is
not
in
itself
a
sufficient
reason
to
deny
reinstatement
of
an
employee
as
a
remedy
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
of
the
importance
of
reinstatement
to
protecting
the
rights
of
coworkers.
what
they
are
aware
of
is
not
what
happened
at
the
board
proceeding.
what
they
are
aware
of
is
that
somebody
was
discharged
for
exercising
his
rights
under
the
act,
but
the
board
says
in
lear-siegler
that
reinstatement
will
be
denied
if
the
misconduct
renders
the
employee
unfit
for
further
employment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
part
of
what
the
employer
could
show
in
showing
that
the
particular
employee
was
unfit.
i
do
want
to
caution
that
there
has
been
no
conviction
of
a
felony
in
this
case.
what
the
administrative
law
judge
found
would,
if
proven
in
a
perjury
prosecution--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
accordance
with
the
proper
procedural--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--under
the
board's
practice,
that
is...
that
would
be
relevant
to
a
showing
by
the
employer
that
the
employee
was
unfit
because
of
his
misconduct
in
the
board
proceedings
for
reinstatement.
no
such
showing
was
made
in
this
case.
the
grant
of
certiorari
is
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
the
board
is
automatically
disabled
from
ordering
backpay
and
reinstatement,
its
normal
remedies
for
an
unlawful
termination--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
an
employee
lied
purposefully.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
certainly
would
take
it
seriously
in
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board's
rule
is
that
lying
or
committing
a
felony
can
be
just
cause
for
discharge.
that
was
not
the
cause
for
discharge
in
this
case,
and
if
manso
or
anyone
else
were
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
misconduct
on
the
job
in
the
future
and
the
employer
wanted
to
terminate
him
for
that
reason,
the
employer
could
do
so,
and
it
would
be
a
termination
for
cause.
all
the
act
prohibits
is
discrimination
for
exercising
the
rights
protected
by
the
act,
which
is
what
was
found
to
have
been
done
here,
and
the
remedial
question
is
all
in
a
context
of
what
has
been
proven
in
proper
proceedings,
which
is
not
a
felony
but
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
the
employer,
and
whether
the
board
should
apply
its
normal
remedies
for
the
unfair
labor
practice.
there
were
statements
made
by
both
sides
in
this
proceeding
that
the
board
determined
to
have
been
false.
the
board
had
no
occasion
to...
even
the
alj
had
no
occasion
to
decide
whether
the
three
supervisors
testifying
on
behalf
of
the
employee...
of
the
employer
had
been
purposefully
lying,
although
the
circumstances
of
rejecting
the
credibility
of
their
testimony
would
suggest
that
it's
quite
probable
that
they
were.
so
it's
quite
probable
that
several
felonies
were
committed
by
persons
on
both
sides
here.
it
just
happens
that
it
was
a
little
more
obvious...
there
was
something
transparently
foolish
about
the
charging
party's
testimony
here,
because
it
had
already
been
disproven
on
a
prior
occasion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
not
giving
relief,
but
they're--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
if
the
normal
backpay
and
reinstatement
remedy
is
denied,
then
the
employer
is
benefiting
from
the
outcome
of
the
proceeding
in
a
way
that
other
employers
who
engage
in
the
same
unlawful
conduct
would
not
benefit...
a
distinct
monetary
benefit
in
comparison
with
his
competitor
down
the
street,
for
example.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
recited
this
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
took
no
exception
to
it.
it
didn't
treat--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--he
really
just
repeated
the
same
story.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
you're
right,
justice
stevens,
that
as
it
was
referred
to
in
recounting
the
earlier
facts,
it
was
referring
to
the
earlier
version
of
the
story.
the
story
was
essentially
the
same
in
both
places.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
employer
would
have
had
an
opportunity
in
the
board
proceedings,
of
which
it
did
not
avail
itself,
to
show
that
under
the
board's
established
approach,
the
owens
illinois/lear-siegler
approach,
this
employee
was
not
entitled
to
the
remedies
because
he
was
unfit
under
the
employer's
criteria,
under
criteria
that
would
be
applied
not
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
only
against
somebody
who
tried
to
exercise
rights
under
the
act,
but
to
any
employee.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr.
justice--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
think
so,
and
we
think
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
board
would
be
acting
beyond
its
authority
if
it
were
an
arbitrary
effort
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
or
if
it
were
inconsistent
with
the
way
the
board
normally
handles
these
cases
and
the
board
is
not
announcing
a
reasoned
change
in
its
approach
to
the
cases
as
a
general
matter
but
is
just
arbitrarily
singling
someone
out.
that
was
really
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
at
the
outset
by
looking
at
the
statute.
except
for
the
one
prohibition
in
the
statute
on
ordering
backpay
or
reinstatement
of
an
employee
who
has
been
discharged
for
cause,
the
question
of
prophylactic
rules
is
a
question
left
to
the
board's
discretion
in
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
act
under
the
general
conferral
of
authority
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
could,
if
its
rationale
were
that
the
rule
were
needed
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
which
do
require
that
the
board
hearings
be
conducted
with
accurate
testimony
before
it
and
that
can
rely
on
sworn
statements
and
the
rest
of
it,
but
the
board
has
taken
a
more
balanced
approach.
there
are
other
purposes
of
the
act
to
be
effectuated
as
well,
and
the
remedies
that
it
has
adopted,
just
as
the
remedies
that
it
has
adopted
in
cases
of
concealment
of
outside
earnings,
are
balanced
so
that
there
is
still
a
disincentive
for
the
employer
to
engage
in
unfair
labor
practices
along
with
a
disincentive
for
the
employee
to
conceal
outside
earnings,
because
the
employee
is
denied
part
of
the
backpay
but
the
employer
still
has
to
pay
part
of
the
backpay.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
was
a
transparent
dog-ate-my-homework
kind
of
lie.
it
was
rather
tangential
to
the
issues
before--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--as
it
turned
out.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
it's
not
the
sort
of
case
that
the
board
is
likely
to
refer
to
the
department
of
justice
for
a
perjury
prosecution,
obviously.
it's
not
the
kind
of
pervasive,
deliberate
lying
that
is
more
likely
to
give
rise
to
that,
and
just
as
the
board
has
to
deal
with
unfitness
for
further
employment
in...
because
of
threats
made
to
a
supervisor,
a
threat
to
kill
him,
it's
not
easy
always
to
sort
out
the
hyperbole
of
the
heat
of
the
moment
from
what
is
a
serious
threat
to
someone's
life
that
may
be
a
felony
if
made.
as
justice
frankfurter
said
for
this
court
many
years
ago,
the
language
of
the
picket
line
is
not
the
language
of
the
parlor.
the
niceties
that
prevail
in
the
courtroom
are
not
always
the
ways
of
blue
collar
witnesses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
it's
a
rule
