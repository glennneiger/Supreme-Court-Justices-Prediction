justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
your
position
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
even
if
an
employee's
of...
even
if
a
management
representative
testifies
blatantly
falsely,
and
in
all
other
respects
the
charge
should
fail
against
the
employer,
you
wouldn't
say
well,
you
go
ahead
and
grant
relief
against
that
company
because
they're
guilty
of
blatant
falsehoods,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether
the
rule
you're
asking
for
is
evenhanded.
in
other
words,
just
assume
the
same
kind
of
perjury
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
that
occurred
here.
would
that
automatically
decide
who
wins
the
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
on
the
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
referring
to
the
sworn
testimony,
or
the
explanation
to
the
employer,
when
he
said
he
was
late
for
work,
and
he
gave
a
phony
reason
for
being
late
for
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
you,
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
this
is
a
chevron-type
case.
you
rely
on
chevron,
to
some
extent,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
the
discretion
of
the
board
is
broad
enough
so
that
you
could
adopt
the
rule
of
the
other
side
advocates,
that
any
employer...
any
employee
who
was
found
to
have
perjured
himself
in
a
board
proceeding
shall
never
get
the
remedy
of
reinstatement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
you
could
go
further
and
say
that
any
employee
who
lies
about
the
reason
he
was
late
for
work
shall
never
be
reinstated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--don't
you
think
the
board
is
supposed
to
have
some
technical
expertise
on
how
the
labor
market
works?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
were
before
the
labor
board
as
opposed
to
the
alj,
did
you
ask
the
labor
board
to
adopt
the
rule
you're
asking
this
court
to
adopt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no...
before
the
labor
board,
in
review
of
the
alj's
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
asked
the
labor
board--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
it's
more
serious
to
lie
to
an
alj
than
to
a
district
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say
it
for
district
judges,
i
assume,
if
district
judges
had
discretion
in
whether
to
give
relief
or
not.
