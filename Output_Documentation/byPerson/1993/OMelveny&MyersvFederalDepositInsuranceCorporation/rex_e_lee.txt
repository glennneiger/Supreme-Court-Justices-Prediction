mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
federal
or
state
law
determines
the
elements
and
the
defenses
of
a
negligence
claim
brought
by
the
fdic
as
receiver
for
a
savings
and
loan
against
an
outside
attorney
for
that
savings
and
loan.
the
case
arises
out
of
the
petitioner's
assisting
in
the
preparation
of
two
private
placement
memoranda
for
american
diversified
savings
bank
over
the
period
from
september
through
december
of
1985.
during
and
prior
to
that
time,
two
individuals
named
sahni
and
day,
who
owned
100
percent
of
adsb,
were
engaged
and
had
been
for
some
time
in
fraudulent
and
other
illegal
activities
which
eventually
resulted
in
federal
and
state
regulators
placing
adsb
into
receivership.
none
of
the
o'melveny
lawyers
was
aware
of
any
of
the
illegal
acts,
nor
are
they
alleged
to
have
been,
nor
of
adsb's
financial
or
regulatory
problems
and,
indeed,
the
adsb
officers
concealed
this
information
from
the
petitioner.
the
ninth
circuit
created
two
federal
rules
of
decision:
first,
that
the
knowledge
of
adsb's
100
percent
owners
was
not
imputed
to
adsb,
and
second,
that
the
fdic
can
avoid
defenses
to
tort
claims
that
would
be
good
against
the
predecessor,
adsb.
in
response
to
an
argument
by
the
petitioner
pointing
out
certain
provisions
of
state
law,
the
ninth
circuit
stated
as
follows,
and
this
is
a
quote:
"the
flaw
in
o'melveny's
argument
is
the
law
o'melveny
assumes
applies.
"
"it
is
now
clear
beyond
doubt
that
federal,
not
state,
law
governs
the
application
of
defenses
against
the
fdic.
"
and
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
do
challenge
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it's
not
one
of
the
issues...
we
think
they
erred
as
a
matter
of
california
law
in
deciding
that.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
that's
not
one
of
the
questions
before
the
court.
what
is
before--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that's
the
issue.
that's
the
issue.
that's
the
issue
on
which--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--oh,
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
certainly
do.
my
friends
here
have
a
little
doubt
about
it,
but
i
certainly
do.
[laughter]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
are
enough,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
would
refer
you
simply
to
four.
the
leading
case
is
mckenney
v.
ellsworth.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
the
case
certainly
could
be
decided
on
the
ground
that
under
federal
common
law
as
it
existed...
and
we
discussed
this
briefly
in
our
reply
brief...
as
it
existed
prior
to
erie
v.
tompkins,
we
think
we
would
win
this
case,
but
the
clearer...
the
ground
on
which
certiorari
was
granted,
and
i
think
the
clearer
and
the
easier
way
to
decide
the
case,
is
to
decide
the
issue
of
state
law.
now,
the
other
question
that
you
asked,
justice
ginsburg,
was
whether
the
ninth
circuit
had
decided
this
on
the
basis
of
state
or
federal
law.
it
is
clear
to
me
they
decided
it
on
the
basis
of
federal
law,
for
three
reasons.
the
first
is
that
that's
what
they
said
they
were
doing.
the
language
that
i
just
quoted
said
the
flaw
in
o'melveny's
argument
is
its
assumption
that
state
law
applies.
it
is
now
clear
that
federal
law
applies
to
all
defenses...
not
just
defense,
but
defenses...
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
fdic,
and
the
second
is
what
they
did.
the
opinion
relies
on
three
federal
opinions.
it
does
not
rely
on
state
law,
and
in
an
analogous
context...
michigan
v.
long...
this
court
said
that
when
the
opinion
relies
on
federal
decisions,
then
they
are
applying
federal
law.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
would
be
a
possibility,
justice
scalia.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
would
be
a
possibility,
and
in
the
usual
case,
that
is
what
you
normally
do.
i
submit
this
is
not
the
usual
case.
the
only
thing
i
would
say
in
that
respect,
justice
scalia,
is
that
i
would
invite
careful
consideration
of
four
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief,
and
those
four
cases
make
it
very
clear...
it's
probably
best
summarized
by
the
west
american
case
and
by
mr.
witkin,
who
is
the
leading
commentator
on
california
law.
the
government
points
out,
quite
correctly,
that
there
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
imputation
in
those
instants
where
the
agent
is
acting
adversely
to
the
principal,
but
in
the
clearest
language
of
the
which
the
english
dictionary
is
capable,
it
then
goes
on
to
say...
in
the
clearest
words
of
which
the
english
language
is
capable,
it
then
goes
on
to
say
that
there
is
an
exception
to
the
exception,
and
that
the
exception
to
the
exception
applies
in
those
instances
where
the
agent
is
in
fact
acting
on
behalf
of
its
principal,
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
that's
what
happened
here.
so--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--there
are
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
last
couple
of
pages
of
our
reply
brief,
justice
ginsburg,
in
which
this
court
has
done
that.
i
realize
that
that
is
not
the
only
option,
but
i
would
simply
reiterate
what
i
said
in
response
to
justice
scalia.
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
mckenney,
west
american,
flagg
v.
seng,
and
austin,
and
i
submit
that
no
reasonable
person
can
read
those
cases
without
concluding
what
california
law
is.
however,
we
do
not
lose
the
case
in
the
event
that
you
do
send
it
back
for
consider...
i
just
don't
think
it's
necessary
in
this
instance.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
do
not,
unfortunately.
the
first...
there
are
three
separate
reasons
why
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
must
be
reversed
and...
and
state
rather
than
federal
law
apply
to
this
case,
and
the
first
is
that
there
is
a
specific
statutory
provision
which
expressly
addresses
both
the
imputation
and
also
the
standing-in-the-shoes
issues
and
resolves
both
of
them.
section
1821(d)(2)(a)
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
act,
which
bears
the
title,
"successor
to
institution",
states
explicitly...
and
this
is
a
quote.
it's
set
forth
in
the
first
page
of
our
opening
brief...
that
as
conservator
or
receiver,
the
fdic
succeeds
to
"all
rights,
titles,
powers,
and
privileges
of
the
insured
depository
institution.
"
now,
in
this
instance,
the
insured
depository
institution
is
a
california
chartered
corporation.
as
such,
its
rights
are
determined
by
california
law,
and
relevant
california
law,
as
i
indicated,
imputes
the
knowledge
of
an
agent
to
his
principal,
and
on
the
second
issue,
whether
the
fdic
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--a
receiver--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you
for
asking
that
question,
justice
souter,
for
two
reasons--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i--
[laughter]
for
two
reasons,
the
answer
is
no.
the
first
is
that
the
right...
the
word
is
not
claims,
it's
rights,
and
you
don't
have
a
right
unless
you
have
a
claim
and
there
are
no
defenses
to
it.
the
second
is
provided...
the
second
reason
is
provided
by
this
court's
decision
in
holmes.
v.
sipek,
which
was
authored
by
the
court,
by
you,
and
that
makes
clear...
that
case
makes
clear,
as
i
read
it,
that
proximate
causation
is
an
essential
element
of
the
claim
itself.
and
under
california
law,
the
reason
that
there
is
no
proximate
causation
is
because
justifiable
reliance
is
a
required
element
of
proximate
causation,
and
there
was
no
justifiable
reliance
where
all
you
are
saying
is,
should
the
o'melveny
lawyers
have
told
sahni
and
day
that
they
were...
discovered
that
sahni
and
day
were
violating
the
law
and
then
told
them
so?
on
the
second
issue--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
and
that's
my
point...
that's
my
point,
and
on
the
other,
on
the
standing-in-the-shoes,
it
could
not
be
more
explicit,
because
it
says,
succeeds
to
all
rights
the
depository
institution
has,
and
that
strikes
right
at
the
heart
of
the
major
premise
that
underlies
the
government's
case,
namely
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
fdic
as
receiver
2-1/2
years
after
the
conduct
at
issue
imposed
for
that
reason
alone
upon
petitioner
additional
liabilities
which
did
not
exist
at
the
time
the
conduct
occurred.
now
my
second
reason.
if
you
didn't
have
the
specific
statute,
the
mere
existence
of
firrea,
with
its
comprehensiveness,
this
370-page
statute
controls
the
issue
of
whether
state
or
federal
law
governs
under
this
court's
decision
in
city
of
milwaukee
v.
illinois.
involved
in
that
case
was
a
comprehensive
statute,
the
1972
amendments
to
the
clean
water
act,
and
the
question
was,
when
you
have
that
kind
of
statute,
which
supplants
preexisting
state
rules
in
some
instances
and
leaves
them
in
place
in
other
instances,
is
it
then
the
proper
function
for
the
federal
courts
to
come
along
behind
and
displace
state
law
in
those
instances
where
congress
elected
to
leave
them
in
place?
the
government's
only
answer
to
that
city
of
milwaukee
argument
is
that
firrea
is
not
in
fact
comprehensive,
and
that,
with
all
due
respect,
is
borderline
laughable.
this
is
a
370-page
statute.
it,
with
its
companion
statutes,
regulates
all
aspects
of
banks,
federal
savings
and--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
yes,
it
could.
d'oench,
duhme,
justice
o'connor,
is
going
to
help
the
government
only
if
you
interpret
it
not
in
light
of
what
that
case
actually
involved,
but
as
establishing
a
per
se,
automatic
rule
that
any
time
the
fdic
enters
the
playing
field
the
playing
field
no
longer
becomes
level,
and
if
you'll
permit
the
further
analogy,
any
players
who
are
wearing
a
state
law
uniform
not
favorable
to
the
government
immediately
have
to
leave.
now,
that's
not
what
d'oench,
duhme
says.
it
is
limited
in
several
respects
and
is
distinguishable
from
this
case
in
several
respects.
in
the
first
place,
it
involved
knowing
conduct,
which
this
case
does
not.
in
the
second
place,
it
involved
a
note,
an
asset
as
opposed
to
a
mere
claim,
and
the
third...
as
i
read
d'oench,
heavy
reliance
was
placed
on
the
fact
that
between
the
time
the
conduct
occurred
and
the
time
the
decision
was
reached,
there
was
a
federal
statute
that
was
actually
enacted,
and
that
federal
statute
heavily
influenced
the
decision
so
that
what
the
court
was
really
doing
was
filling
in
a
vacuum
that
existed
in
between
the
time
of
the
conduct
and
the
time
of
the
decision.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
wrongdoers
of
a
certain--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
wrongdoers
of
a
certain
quality,
not
those
who
only
have
been
alleged,
and
i
repeat
in...
what
i
said
earlier
to
the
chief
justice.
we
do
not
agree
that
there
was
a
lack
of
exercise
of
due
care,
but
that's
not
before
the
court.
though
a
difference
between
those
who
are
alleged
not
to
have
exercised
due
care
and
those
who
have
engaged
in
deliberate
conduct--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that's
part
of
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
difficult
to
say
whether
the
taxpayers
would
really
benefit
or
not,
justice
o'connor.
if
i
may
tie
that
to
our
kimbell
foods
analysis,
and
that's
the
third
reason...
that's
the
third
reason
that
this
case
must
be
reversed.
one
of
the
three
kimbell
foods
factors
has
to
do
with
whether
there
is
a
need
for
a
particular
federal
rule
in
the
particular
instance.
the
only
argument
that
the
government
even
makes
with
respect
to
why
a
special
federal
rule
is
needed
here
is
the
more
money
argument,
that
because
otherwise
it
would
deplete
the
deposit
insurance
fund.
i
cannot
emphasize
too
strongly
that
this
argument
that
the
application
of
federal
law
will
result
in
the
fdic
recovering
more
money
is
entitled
to
no
weight
at
all,
and
i'm
going
to
tie
this
back
to
your
taxpayer's
question.
kimbell
foods
itself
rejected
that
very
argument,
and
it
did
so
on
two
grounds
that
are
highly
relevant
to
this
case.
the
first
one
is
that
in
this
case
as
in
kimbell
foods
the
relevant
statute
provides
other
means,
other
than
just
getting
more
money
into
the
federal
deposit
insurance
fund,
for
protecting
the
public.
these
include
the
ability
of
the
federal
regulators
to
increase
both
the
capital
and
the
capital-to-assets
ratios,
to
increase
the
insurance
premium,
and
in
extreme
cases
even
to
remove
management,
and
even
more
relevant,
it
is
also
true
here,
as
it
was
in
kimbell
foods,
that
the
principal
purpose
of
these
insurance
statutes
is
not
to
raise
money.
kimbell
foods
made
that
very
explicit,
and
i
would
point
out
that
what
kimbell
foods
involved
was
two
federal
insurance
programs,
one
administered
by
the
sba
and
the
other
administered
by
the
fha,
and
kimbell
foods
pointed
out
that
these
are
social
welfare
legislation
statutes.
unlike
tax
statutes,
they
are
not
money-raising
statutes.
the
same
is
true
with
the
federal
deposit...
well,
with
these
various
acts,
firrea
and
the
federal
deposit
insurance
act,
whose
principal
purposes
extend
to
economic
incentives
to
encourage
residential
lending,
the
development
of
low
and
moderate
income
housing,
and
lending
in
depressed
real
estate
markets.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
point
is,
justice
scalia,
that
it
is
not
its
only
purpose,
and
that
in
balancing
the
various
different
objectives,
of
which
protecting
the
public
fisc
is
of
course
one
of
them,
the
clear
message
that
comes
from
milwaukee
and
from
kimbell
foods
and
a
lot
of
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
dealing
with
this
issue,
the
net
balancing
of
those
competing
values
is
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
particularly
where,
as
in
city
of
milwaukee...
and
here
you
have
such
a
comprehensive
statute
where
many
defenses
have
been
eliminated
and
others
left
intact,
and
particularly
where,
as
here,
you
have
other
objectives,
other
than
just
the
money
raising.
the
balancing,
in
short,
is
for
congress,
and
not
for
the
courts.
i
return
now
to
the
other
two
of
the
kimbell
foods
factors.
the
first
one
is
whether
there's
a
need
for
a
uniform
federal
law.
the
government's
conduct
in
this
very
case
shows
that
there
is
no
such
need.
what
the
government
did
in
this
particular
instance
was
to
ask
for
the
application,
and
the
court
of
appeals
gave
it
to
them,
of
what
they
perceived
to
be
state
law
on
the
first
issue,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
was
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
duty
of
due
care
that
was
owed.
then,
once
they
turned
to
the
imputation
and
the
standing-in-the-shoes
issues,
on
which
state
law
does
not
favor
them,
then
the
government
changed
its
direction
and
asked
for
the
application
of
federal
common
law,
which
the
ninth
circuit
gave
them.
this
court
made
very
clear
in
kimbell
foods,
but
even
more
clear
in
united
states
v.
yazell,
that
when
the
government
attempts
this
mix-and-match,
pick-and-choose
combination
of
federal
and
state
law
and
asks
for
state
law
to
be
applicable
in
certain
instances,
that
that
is
immensely
material
in
the
language
of
yazell,
immensely
material
to
the
issue
of
whether
a
uniform
rule
really
is
needed.
the
final
of
the
kimbell
foods
factors
concerns
whether
a
federal
rule
of
decision
would
severely
disrupt
commercial
relationships
predicated
on
state
law.
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
two
areas
of
state
law
than
which
there
are
none
clearer,
that
are
the
essential
and
traditional
centuries-long
prerogative
of
the
state
courts...
tort
law,
disciplining
of
lawyers,
and
the
related
one,
the
relationship
of
lawyer
and
client.
each
of
these
represents
an
area
in
which
the
body
of
government
state
law
has
been
developed
over
decades,
and
in
some
cases
even
centuries,
and
to
now
place
that
burden
in
federal
courts,
displacing
those
bodies
of
governmental
state
concern,
would
not
only
severely
disrupt
commercial
relationships
predicated
on
state
law,
but
would
also
be
extremely
burdensome
on
the
federal
courts.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we're
told
that
federal
common
law
is
necessary
in
order
to
vindicate
the
federal
interest.
what
vindicates
the
federal
interest
is
for
congress,
and
congress
here
has
spoken.
we
have
heard
not
one
word
in
response
to
section
1821
as
governing
both
of
these
two
issues,
and
there
is
no
response.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
not,
but
let
me
address
that
right
now,
because--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
because
the
precise
issue
of
the
depositors
is
not
before
this
court,
and
i...
that's
one
of
the
most
important
things
that
i
need
to
clarify
in
this
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course,
and
you
don't
even
turn
to
state
law
because
the
federal
statute
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
but
on
the
second
issue
of
the
standing
in
the
shoes,
it
deals
with
that
expressly
and
on
its
own.
but
let
me
just
cut
right
through,
justice
stevens,
and
tell
you
that
the
real
answer
to
this
is
that
the
claims
of
the
creditors
are
not
involved
in
this
case
for
two
separate
and
independently
sufficient
reasons.
the
first
is
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
dietrich
v.
standard
surety,
in
order
for
the
fdic
to
assert
claims
on
behalf
of
creditors,
those
have
to
be
alleged
and
proven.
they
have
been
neither
in
this
case.
moreover,
under
this
court's
recent
decision
in
holmes
v.
sipek,
they
could
not
be
proven.
why?
because
in
the
language
of
that
decision
there
is
too
much...
the
link
is
too
remote
between
the
o'melveny
&
myers
law
firm
and
those
creditors.
this
is
not...
the
proximate
cause
defense
is
not
just
a...
it's
not
just
a
defense,
it
is
also
an
element
of
the
claim,
as
holmes
v.
sipek
makes
very
clear.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
rely
on
the
claims
of
creditors.
the
government
did
not
rely
on
the
claims
of
creditors
when
it
originally
brought
this
suit,
and
those
claims
of
creditors
simply
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
coming
back
to
the
vindication
of
federal
interests,
in
addition
to
the
specific
statute,
which
stands
unassailed,
you
also
have
this
comprehensive
statute,
firrea.
mr.
bender
says...
and
it's
absolutely
essential
to
his
case
to
say
this...
that
this
is
not
a
total
package
of
federal
law.
i
assert
to
you,
it
is
a
total
package
of
federal
law
under
city
of
milwaukee,
and
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
this
is
not
a
total
package
of
federal
law,
then
city
of
milwaukee
has
got
to
be
overruled.
it
did,
justice
souter,
establish
a
higher
duty
of
obligation
on
behalf
of
officers
and
directors.
it
also,
justice
scalia,
eliminated
a
lot
of
defenses,
probably
dozens
of
defenses,
but
some
of
them
it
left
intact,
and
if
city
of
milwaukee
and
kimbell
foods
mean
anything
at
all,
it
is
that
when
congress
has
spoken
definitively
and
comprehensively,
picking
out
some
to
be
left
in
place
and
others
to
be
displaced,
it
is
not
the
job,
then,
of
the
lawyers
for
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
courts
to
come
along
behind
and
declare
what
federal
policy
is.
now,
with
regard
to
causation,
the
only
way
that
the
government
can
satisfy
the
causation
responsibility
in
this
case
is
to
argue
for
a
but-for
house-that-jack-built
type
of
causation.
necessarily,
the
causation
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
instance
if
california
law
applies,
as
it
must,
is
proximate
causation
and
not
but-for
causation.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
flagg
v.
seng,
which
is
very
clear
on
this
point,
and
is
squarely
consonant
with
holmes
v.
sipek.
that
case
says
that
unless
there
is
justifiable
reliance,
which
there
is
not
if
you
impute
the
knowledge
of
the
agent
to
the
corporation,
then
there
is
no
proximate
cause,
and
it's
not,
as
i
say,
just
a
defense,
it
is
also
an
element
of
the
claim.
with
regard
to
kimbell
foods,
let
me
just
point
out
i've
heard
nothing
today,
and
really
there
is
nothing
effective
in
the
brief,
that
disputes
as
to
all
three
of
those
kimbell
foods
factors
the
following:
1)
they
are
mixing
and
matching.
the
argument
that
has
been
made
here
today
that
they're
now
asserting
the
claims
of
creditors,
when
they
didn't
even
assert
them
in
their
complaint,
is
another
classic
example
of
mixing
and
matching.
with
regard
to
the
second,
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
exactly.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
exactly,
and
we
don't
object
to
that.
all
we
object
to
is
the
government,
in
those
instances
when
it
does
mix
and
match,
come
in
and
then
say
that
it's
absolutely
essential
to
have
a
uniform
body
of
law,
because
as
this
court
said
in
yazell,
that
is
rejected
by
their
own
conduct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
i
think
not
contrary
to
what
the
law
is
many
other
states,
but--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes...
well,
the
best
example
is
west
v.
at&t,
which
is
cited
at
footnote
9
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
