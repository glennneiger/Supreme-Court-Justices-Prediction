mr.
lee,
while
you're
still
on
the
statute...
and
i'm
anxious
for
you
also
to
get
to
the
second
point...
i
take
it
the
wording
of
the
statute
in
its
structure
would
prevent
us
from
saying
that
the
initial
liability,
the
initial
duty,
is
also
controlled
by
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
do
say
that
there
has
to
be
an
underlying
federal
rule
determining
the
scope
of
duties
of
the
counsel
to
its
insured
institution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
not
sure
what
the
source
of
law
is
for
you
to
prevail
if,
as
justice
souter
said,
there's
no
proximate
causation
under
the
law
of
california.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
be
proceeding
under
something
other
than
12
u.s.c.
1821.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
your
whole
hypothesis
is
that
you
are
succeeding
to
a
cause
of
action
that
exists
under
the
state
law,
and
under
justice
souter's
hypothetical
question,
that
isn't
true,
and
you
say
you
prevail
anyway--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
doing
is
basing
a
substantive
right
of
recovery,
one
which
formulates
the
duty
of
the
professional,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
i
suppose
it's
a
plausible
enough
position,
but
it's
certainly
not
under
1821.
