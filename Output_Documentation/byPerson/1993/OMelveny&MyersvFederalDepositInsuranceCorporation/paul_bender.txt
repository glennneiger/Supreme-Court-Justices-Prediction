mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
law
firm
that
was
retained
by
a
federally
insured
savings
institution
in
order
to
prepare
what
are
called
private
placement
memoranda
in
connection
with
the
saving
institution's
offering
of
a
land
development
scheme.
it
is
alleged,
and
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
we
have
to
assume
it's
true,
that
in
the
course
of
preparing
that
ppm...
private
placement
memorandum...
petitioner
committed
malpractice.
specifically,
the
malpractice
that
they
committed...
were
alleged
to
have
committed
was
this.
the
private
placement
memorandum
says
in
it
that
the
bank
in
this
case
had
sufficient
resources
to
finance
the
land
development
scheme
that
the
bank
was
floating.
that
was
not
true.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
bank
was
insolvent.
the
negligence
that
is
asserted
against
petitioner
is
that
they
negligently
failed
to
discover
that,
and
put
in
the
ppm
that
the
bank
was
in
fact
solvent,
and
that
assets
would
be
there
to
lend
to
the
partnership
for
the
purposes
of
the
land
development
project.
if
petitioner
had
discovered,
as
it
should
have,
that
the
bank
was
insolvent,
it
never
could
have
put
that,
and
never
would
have
put
that,
in
the
ppm,
and
the
scheme
would
not
have
gone
forward.
the
allegation
is
that
because
the
scheme
went
forward,
that
cost
the
bank
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
it
did
that
because
shortly
after
the
scheme
closed,
federal
regulators
came
in,
discovered
that
the
bank
was
insolvent,
and
once
the
bank
was
insolvent,
the
land
development
project
couldn't
go
forward
because
the
assets
of
the
bank
were
necessary
for
that
project
to
go
forward.
so
petitioner's
negligence
directly
related
to
the
viability
of
this
project,
and
by
negligently
failing
to
discover
that
the
bank
was
insolvent,
petitioner
hurt
the
bank.
now,
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
expenses
of
floating
this
scheme,
and
then
having
to
withdraw
it,
and
those
expenses
were
considerable.
they're
not
in
proof
here,
they're
merely
allegations,
but
that
is
exactly
what
the
fdic
is
claiming.
it's--
mr.
paul
bender
--in
the
first
place
to
the
directors
and
officers
of
the
bank.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
they
already
knew
about
it,
but
to
have
the
law
firm
bring
it
to
their
attention
might
have
stopped
them
from
going
forward
with
the
scheme,
but
more
importantly,
they
shouldn't
have
signed
on
to
the
ppm.
the
problem
was--
mr.
paul
bender
--because
the
law
firm
certification
is
necessary
for
shares
in
this
partnership
to
be
sold.
if
the
law
firm
had
said,
we
can't
prepare
this
ppm
because
the
bank
isn't
solvent,
and
therefore
we
can't
say
to
potential
investors
that
the
funds
are
there
to
fund
the
development
project,
then
the
development
project
wouldn't
have
gone
forward.
that's
the
causality.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
but
the
bank
is
suing,
and
the
bank
is
suing...
the
fdic
is
suing
in
place
of
the
bank,
and
that's
the
point
i
wanted
to
make.
it's
very
important
to
understand
here--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
that
issue
has
been
tried.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
if
california
law
provided...
as
i
don't
think
it
does,
but
if
it
provided,
contrary
to
the
factual
causation,
that
there
was
no
proximate
causation,
then
in
order
to
adequately
protect
the
federal
interest,
which
i'll
get
to
in
a
moment,
that
california
rule
would
have
to
yield
to
the
federal
rule,
because
the
harm
here...
because
the
bank
was
insolvent,
the
harm
here
by
petitioner's
negligence
is
not
harm
to
the
stockholders.
the
stockholders...
once
the
bank
is
insolvent,
the
stockholders'
stock
can't
be
worth
any
less.
as
the
petitioner's
negligence
drives
the
bank
further
into
insolvency,
the
harm
occurs
to
the
creditors
of
the
bank.
who
are
the
creditors
of
the
bank?
the
creditors
of
the
bank
are
principally
the
depositors.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
not
the
scope
of
duties,
and
not
the
rule
of
negligence.
those
things
are
determined
under
california
law.
the
duty
here
was
to
the
bank...
not
to
the
stockholders,
not
to
the
insiders,
but
to
the
bank.
mr.
paul
bender
because
under
the
law
of
california
there's
a
duty
to
the
bank,
and
under
the
law
of
california,
the
allegation
is
that
the
petitioner
was
negligent.
if
the
petitioner's
negligence
caused
harm
to
the
federal
interest,
which
it
did
here,
our
position
is
that
california
cannot
have
a
rule
of
law
that
would
prevent
that
federal
interest
from
being
vindicated.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
not
whatever
favors
the
government
in
some
proprietary
sense.
it's
a
question
of
whatever
furthers
the
interests
of
the
federal
legislation.
the
federal
legislation,
as
we
all
know,
provides
that
deposits
in
a
bank
like
this
are
insured
by
the
federal
government,
and
in
turn
they
are
insured
by
the
taxpayers
who
have
to
make
sure
that
the
fund
has
enough
in
it
to
pay
the
federal
government.
when
negligence
is
committed
to
an
insolvent
bank,
that
causes
harm
to
the
depositors.
the
money
to
pay
back
their
deposits,
the
pool
of
money,
goes
down.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
not
whatever
gets
us
the
greatest
recovery,
it's
whatever
adequately
provides
for
compensation
for
the
harm
done
to
the
federal
deposit
insurance--
mr.
paul
bender
--it's
the
harm
done
to
the
fund.
the
negligence
of
a
professional
in
representing
an
insolvent
bank,
which
causes
loss
of
money
to
that
bank,
directly
causes
harm
to
the
depositors
of
the
bank.
if
the
depositors
were
not
insured,
the
bank
would
be
held
in
trust
for
them.
that's
ancient
common
law...
in
trust
for
the
creditors
and
the
depositors.
here,
the
depositors
are
insured,
so
the
fdi
stands
in
their
shoes.
the
harm
that's
done
here
is
harm
by
negligence
to
the
deposit
fund,
and
all
the
fdic
is
trying
to
recover
here
is
the
harm
to
the
deposit
fund.
mr.
paul
bender
why
is
that,
justice
kennedy?
mr.
paul
bender
no--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
federal
law
initially
applies,
but
as
this
court
knows,
the
presumption
is
that
in
cases
involving
the
fdic
we
will
use
state
law
as
long
as
the
state
law
adequately
protects
the
federal
interest.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
almost
metaphysical.
this
court
has
said
on
most
occasions
that
when
the
fdi
sues
the
law
that's
applicable
is
federal
law,
but
the
federal
law
initially
presumes
that
state
law
is
applicable,
and
the
federal
law
borrows
state
law,
except
where
the
state
law
is
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
federal
statute.
it's
a
through--
mr.
paul
bender
--because
i
think
the
presumption
of
the
federal
scheme
here
is
that
professionals
who
work
for
a
federally
insured
bank
shouldn't
be
absolutely
liable.
they
should
be
liable
under--
mr.
paul
bender
--because
it
would
be--
mr.
paul
bender
--and
we
don't
challenge
that.
the
normal
responsibilities
continue
to
apply,
but
what
this
case
involves,
as
mr.
lee
has
said,
is
whether
a
particular
defense
should
be
applicable,
and
you've
got
to
look
at
the
reasons
for
that
defense
and
see
whether
the
reasons
make
it
applicable
here.
mr.
paul
bender
but
it's
the
bank's
claim,
it's
not
the
stockholders'
claim.
it's
not
sahni
and
day's
claim.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
and
if
state
law
totally
eliminated
the
bank's
claim
in
this
situation,
that
might
raise
a
federalism
problem,
and
federal
law
might
have
to
come
in
and
say
that
that's
not
sufficient
to
protect
the
federal
interest.
that
doesn't
arise
in
this
case,
because
state
law
here
clearly
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
negligent
professionals
who
serve
banks.
what
the
petitioner
wants
to
do
here
is
raise
a
defense
which
it
says
it
can
raise
because
the
insiders
at
the
bank
committed
wrongdoing,
and
as
an
equitable
matter
they
shouldn't
be
liable
because
the
insiders
committed
wrongdoing.
that
would
be
a
perfectly
good
defense
if
the
insiders
were
suing,
the
insiders
were
the
100
percent
stockholders.
then
it
wouldn't
be
fair,
and
state
law
would
provide
and
so
would
federal
law.
it
wouldn't
be
fair
to
let
the
insiders
recover,
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
not
entirely
clear,
justice
o'connor.
we
believe
that
state
law
would
hold,
as
would
the
law
of
most
states,
as
most
federal
courts
that
have
had
to
guess
what
state
law
was
in
this
area
have
held,
that
state
law
would
hold
that
this
imputation
defense
is
not
available
to
petitioner
in
these
circumstances,
because
the
people
who
are
suing
are
not
the
wrongdoers.
mr.
paul
bender
you
need
a
federal
rule
in
case
state
law
should
hold
otherwise.
mr.
paul
bender
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
divided
the
issue
in
an
interesting
way.
the
ninth
circuit
first
held
that
the
wrongdoing
of
sahni
and
day
would
not
be
imputed
to
the
bank
because
the
bank's
interest,
once
the
bank
was
insolvent,
was
adverse
to
the
interests
of
sahni
and
day.
it's
not
clear
whether
they...
in
doing
that
they
were
relying
on
state
law
or
federal
law.
the
opinion
relies
on
some
federal
cases,
it
rejects
the
leading
federal...
state
case
that
petitioners
cite,
but--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
i
don't
think
you
should,
and
the
reason
we
acquiesced
in
certiorari
here
is
because
the
defense
that
was
raised
by
the
petitioners
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
one
which
if
it
were
viable
would
be
a
very
important
defense.
it
would
stop
the
fdic
from
getting
compensation
to
the
fund
for
all
kinds
of
wrongdoing.
the
ninth
circuit,
we
believe,
correctly
rejected
that
defense.
it's
a
very
important
point
of
federal
law,
we
think,
to
affirm
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
and
say
that
this
equitable
defense
is
not
available
when
the
people
who
were
suing
are
not
the
wrongdoers,
and
here--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
reason
for
resolution
is
because
that
issue
is
raised...
there
are
many,
many
of
these
lawsuits
involving
over
$1
billion
in
asserted
liability
that
are
brought
by
the
fdic
all
around
the
country.
this
defense,
this
kind
of
defense,
imputation
defense
that
the
bank
is
somehow
responsible
for
the
wrongdoing
of
the
insiders
is
raised
by
defendant
professionals
in
those
suits
over
and
over
again.
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
that
defense.
that
rejection
is
an
important
point
of
federal
law,
and
that's
the
reason
we
assume
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
and
that's
the
important
federal
issue
that
needs
to
be
resolved.
because
if
you
don't...
if
you
permit
that
imputation
defense
to
be
available,
you
do
two
things:
1)
you
really
harm
the
federal
interest
here.
you
harm
the
federal
interest
because
professionals--
mr.
paul
bender
--it's
worse
than
that.
it's
worse
than
that.
think
about
a
law
firm
which
is
retained
by
a
bank,
and
what
the
incentives
are
if
this
defense
were
available.
the
incentives
are
not
to
discover
fraud,
not
to
discover
that
the
bank
is
insolvent.
if
you
discover
that
the
bank
is
insolvent,
what's
going
to
happen?
you'll
have
to
say
so.
you
won't
be
able
to
finish
the
ppm.
the
project
won't
be
able
to
go
forward.
you
may
never
even
get
your
fee.
because
the
bank's
insolvent,
you're
just
a
creditor.
the
depositors
come
first.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
don't
discover
it,
then
you
get
paid,
the
scheme
goes
forward,
and
if
the
defense
applies,
you're
never
going
to
be
liable.
the
incentive--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
it
is,
and
therefore
we
think
that
california
would
hold
the
same
way.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
it's
federal
law
if
the
state
law
doesn't
provide
that.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
not
grabbing
what's
best
for
the
government,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it's
establishing
a
minimum
base
of
federal
law
that's
necessary.
mr.
paul
bender
i
agree
with
that,
that
the
federal
government
is
in
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--there
should
be
a
special
rule
if
a
state,
as
petitioners
argue
here,
were
to
depart
from
that
rule.
if
a
state
were
to
say,
you
do
impute
the
defense
to
the
bank,
and
stop
the
bank
from
suing,
that
rule--
mr.
paul
bender
--isn't
adequate
to
protect
the
federal
interest.
that's
what
kimbell
foods
holds.
you
have
a
national
federal
program
here
of
insuring
these
institutions.
you
have
a
program
where
the
fdic
becomes
subrogated
to
the
claims
of
the
depositors.
it
is
important
for
that
national
federal
program
1)
to
make
sure
that
the
depositors'
claims,
which
the
fdic
is
subrogated
to,
are
compensated,
so
if
the
fund--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
statute
was
written,
we
believe,
in
light
of
the
background
that
this
federal
common
law
necessary
to
preserve
the
federal
interest
would
be
available.
we
don't
think
you
can
read--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
federal--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
the
question
is...
the
statute
i
take
it
you're
referring
to
is
firrea
in
1989.
mr.
paul
bender
the
question
is,
assuming
that
there
was...
and
we
think
it's
clear
that
prior
to
that
time
there
was
this
minimum
base
of
federal
common
law
necessary
to
preserve
the
interests
of
the
federal
program.
just
like
in
d'oench,
duhme,
the
court
said
there's
a
rule
of
federal
law
that
says
that
unwritten
side
agreements
can't
be
applied
against
the
fdic.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
don't
think
the
statute
purports
to
be
a
total
package
of
what
the
federal
government's
rights
are,
nor
does
petitioner.
petitioner
admits,
and
we
agree,
that
state
common
law
of
negligence
would
be
available
to
the
fdic
here,
so
it's
clear
that
the...
and
that's
after
firrea
was
enacted
in
1989.
it's
clear
that
firrea
didn't
mean
to
take
over
exclusively
all
of
the
rights
of
the
fdic
in
suing
the
professional
in
this
case.
everybody
agrees
that
they
at
least
have
the
rights
provided
by
state
and
common
law.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
because
that's
not
what
the
court
has
held
over
the
years,
and
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
hold
that.
the
feds
presumptively
take
the
common
law
as
it
is,
but
if
there's
something
in
the
common
law
that
would
be
applied
by
the
state
that
insufficiently
protects
the
federal
interest,
as
in
d'oench,
duhme,
for
example--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
they
assume
that
there's
a
body
of
common
law
that
is
going
to
be
applicable
and
available
to
the
fdic.
mr.
paul
bender
even
when
state
law
would
mean
that
the
federal
interest
was
not
adequately
protected.
mr.
paul
bender
then
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
you
can
assume
that
congress,
in
passing
firrea,
meant
to
say,
all
defenses
that
the
state
would
provide
are
available,
except
those
we
specifically
exclude
here.
mr.
paul
bender
you
shouldn't
assume
that
because
i
don't
think
that
was
congress'
purpose
in
passing
it.
it
would
be
especially
ironic
to
assume
that
in
this
case
when
we
know
that
congress'
principal
purpose
in
passing
firrea
was
to
shore
up
the
ability
of
the
system
to
stop
malfeasance
from
draining
the
federal
treasury,
as
had
happened
many
times
during
the
decade
before
this
statute.
many
banks
became
insolvent
because
of
the
wrongdoing
of
insiders
of
the
banks,
and
in
part
because
outside
professionals
called
in
by
those
insiders
did
not
act
carefully
to
protect
the
federal
fisc.
mr.
paul
bender
but
there's
no...
there's
no
significant
cost
here.
the
only
cost
that
would
be
present
here
is
the
cost
of
not
permitting
the
petitioners
to
use
a
defense
against
people
who
the
defense
was
never
meant
to
be
usable
against.
as
justice
o'connor
said
during
mr.
lee's
argument,
the
purpose
of
this
defense
is
to
stop
wrongdoers
from
collecting
for
their
own
wrongdoing.
that
would--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
you
can...
the
only
way
i
can
tell
is
from
the
same
thing
that
you
have
before
you.
the
district
judge
said,
very
summarily,
that
he
didn't
think
the
law
firm
owed
any
duty
to
anybody
except
the
investors
in
the
scheme,
and
the
finding
that
the
investors
had
been
compensated...
the
investment
was
cancelled
and
they
got
their
money
back.
finding
that
the
investors
had
been
compensated,
he
said,
well,
there's
no
duty
to
anybody
else,
and
therefore
i
grant
summary
judgment.
that
was
patently
wrong.
the
duty
of
the
professionals...
maybe
they
do
have
a
duty
to
the
investors,
but
their
primary
duty
is
to
their
client,
and
the
client
here
is
the
bank,
so
the
district
court
just
went
off
on
something
that
was
wrong.
there
was
a
duty
to
the
bank.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
you
have
to
see
it
in
time
sequence.
the
bank
is
insolvent.
the
professional
commits
negligence.
the
negligence
harms
the
bank,
and
with
an
insolvent
bank,
the
negligence
harms
the
creditors
of
the
bank.
the
negligence
harms
the
depositors.
at
that
time,
the
depositors
have
a
claim
which
is
held
in
trust
for
them
by
the
bank.
the
depositors
have
a
claim
against
the
petitioner,
against
the
outside
professional.
the
defense
doesn't
come
in
until
that
suit
is
brought.
when
that
suit
is
brought,
the
professional
says,
we
have
a
defense.
what's
the
defense?
the
defense
is
equitable
estoppel,
because
the
insiders
of
the
bank
were
wrongdoers.
that
just
doesn't
apply.
mr.
paul
bender
exactly.
exactly,
and
i
think
it's
really
important...
there
are
a
number
of
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case
which
say
that
the
thing
that's
wrong
with
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
it
changes
the
rules
of
professional
responsibility,
and
that
that's
an
inappropriate
thing
for
the
federal
government
to
do,
and
we
think
that
by
and
large
that
is
an
inappropriate
thing
for
the
federal
government
to
do,
but
that's
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
decided
in
this
case.
nothing
the
ninth
circuit
decided
has
anything
to
do
with
the
duty
of
care
of
the
professionals.
they
had
a
duty
of
care
when
they
took
on
this
assignment.
if
you
had
said
to
them
the
moment
after
they
were
retained
by
the
bank,
do
you
have
a
duty
of
care
to
discover
things
that
should
be
in
the
ppm
that
aren't
there,
or
do
you
have
a
duty
of
care
to
make
sure
the
statements
said
in
there
are
correct,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
for
them
to
say--
mr.
paul
bender
--but
justice
scalia,
it's
not
just
the
directors.
the
ppm
isn't
for
the
benefit
of
the
directors.
the
ppm
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
investors,
and
they--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
no.
it's
a
duty
that
they
have
because
the
bank
is
insolvent.
they
have
a
duty
to
their
client,
and
their
client
is
the
bank,
and
at
the
moment
of
insolvency
the
bank
is
no
longer
the
directors,
and
the
bank
is
no
longer
the
shareholders.
at
the
moment
of
insolvency,
the
bank
becomes
the
creditors
of
the
bank,
and
the
bank
holds
those
creditors'
claims
in
trust,
so
their
duty
is,
at
that
moment,
to
those
creditors,
and
it's
just
not
plausible
that
they
are
absolved
from
that
duty
because
of
the
wrongdoing
of
somebody
completely
different.
mr.
paul
bender
i
wouldn't
concede
that
they
didn't
used
to
be
able
to
sue.
these
people
could
always
sue.
the
question
is
whether--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
bank.
the
creditors.
they
can't
sue--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
bank
is
the
creditors
when
the
bank
becomes
insolvent.
that's
the
key
to
understanding
this
case.
if
this
had
happened
while
the
bank
was
solvent,
there
would
be
a
perfectly
good
defense,
because
while
the
bank
was
solvent,
then
the
harms
caused
here...
the
$10
million,
let's
say,
that
was
spent
on
this
aborted
scheme...
would
come
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
shareholders.
their
stock
would
be
worth
less.
so
while
the
bank
is
solvent,
then
this
defense
applies,
but
once
the
bank
becomes
insolvent,
then
the
interests
of
the
creditors
are
the
important
interests,
and
there
was
never
a
defense
against
those
creditors.
they
never
did
anything
wrong.
it's
utterly
absurd
to
say
that.
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
was
that
if
state
law
purported
to
say
that
absurdity,
if
state
law
purported
to
get
in
the
way
of
a
lawsuit
that's
1)
necessary
to
compensate
the
fund,
and
2)...
and
i
think
this
is
important...
necessary
to
make
sure
that
professionals
who
act
on
behalf
of
insured
savings
institutions
do
so
carefully,
if
state
law
got
in
the
way
of
that
and
tried
to
erect
a
law
that
didn't
protect
those
interests,
then
that's
just
where
the
theory
of
kimbell
foods
comes
into
play.
then
the
state
law
is
not
adequately
protecting
the
federal
interest,
and
under
kimbell
foods
and
under
d'cench,
duhme,
under
a
long
line
of
this
court's
decisions,
that
state
law
is
discarded,
is
not
used
because
it's
not
adequate
to
protect
the
federal
interest.
it's
really
important
to
understand
here
what's
really
going
on
is
the
need
to
have
a
system
of
law
that
adequately
protects
insured
institutions
against
looting
by
insiders.
that's
not
fanciful.
looting
by
insiders
of
insured
institutions
cause
billions
of
dollars
to
the
federal
fisc.
sometimes,
in
a
significant
number
of
those
cases,
congress
found
that
the
negligent
conduct
of
third
party
professionals
was
causal
in
permitting
those
insiders
to
do
the
looting.
it's
important,
it's
vital
under
kimbell
foods,
it
would
frustrate
the
federal
interest
under
kimbell
foods,
if
you
had
state
law
applying
that
didn't
protect
that
interest.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
because
i
don't
think
firrea...
firrea
added
administrative
claims
against
directors
or
administrative
penalties,
but
that's
different
from--
mr.
paul
bender
--for
those
administrative
penalties.
mr.
paul
bender
but
that
did
not
supplant
the
state
common
law,
the
federal
common
law
which
will
absorb
the
state
common
law,
of
directors'
liability
for
negligence.
that
was...
that
gross
negligence
standard
was
for
administrative
penalties.
those
penalties,
by
the
way,
do
not
go
to
the
same
place,
and
that's
very
important.
those
penalties
do
not
go
into
the
insurance
fund,
so
that
cannot
be
seen
as
an
attempt
to
protect
the
insurance
fund.
that's
more
of
a
penal
way
of
controlling
the
directors'
behavior.
i
don't
think
petitioner
urges,
and
we
certainly
don't,
that
that
provision
of
firrea
was
meant
to
displace
the
state
common
law
of
negligence
of
directors
and
officers.
that's
still
in
place,
and
even
more
clearly
the
law
here
is.
