mr.
lee,
why
should...
assuming
that
they
did
rely
on
federal
law,
why
shouldn't
we
give
them
the
job
of...
i
mean,
we
have
enough
trouble
figuring
out
what
federal
law
is.
they're
closer
to
california
law.
why
don't
we...
if
you're
correct...
just
send
it
back
there
and
let
them
figure
out
what
california
law
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
what
we
normally
would
do,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
california
have
a
certification
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
point,
mr.
lee...
that
government
doesn't
care
about
losing
money
unless
it's
under
the
tax
laws.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
if
preserving
the
fisc
is
an
important
value,
it's
an
important
value,
in
whatever
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
whom
would
they
have
brought
this
information?
to
whose
attention
would
they
have
brought
this
information?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
already
knew
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
might
be
a...
you
know,
a
dishonorable
thing
to
do,
but
i
don't
see
how
there's
any
causality
here.
i
mean,
to
tell
the
officer
what
he
already
knows--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
investors
were
suing,
it
would
be
a
different
matter,
but
they've
already
been
made
whole.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
allow
the
state
to
insist
on
negligence?
i
mean,
if
you
really
want
to
protect
the
federal
fisc,
why
don't
you
impose
an
absolute
liability
on
these
lawyers
to
make
sure
that
everything's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
make
that
presumption?
i
can
understand
the
answer,
the
presumption
is
that
state
law
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
presumption
is
that
the
normal
responsibilities
which
existed
before
the
fdic
took
over
continue
afterwards,
and
that
nothing
changes
simply
because
the
government
steps
in.
as
the
statute
says,
it
steps
into
the
rights
of
the
bank.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
i
mean,
any
defense
does.
i'd
stipulate
that.
of
course
you
do.
you
say...
you
get
less
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
unique
to
the
federal
government
situation?
isn't
it
the
same
in
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
talk
about
d'oench,
duhme.
the
federal
statute,
you're
there.
i
think
you
could
make
the
argument
which
you're
trying
to
make
about
firrea...
the
firrea
statute,
that
it
was
legislated
against
a
background
of
federal
common
law.
d'oench,
duhme
was
decided
3
years
after
erie.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
legislation
at
issue
in
that
case
was
undoubtedly
enacted
on
the
assumption
that
federal
courts
applied
federal
law,
period.
you
wouldn't
have
to
dance
around
erie
and
claxton
and
all
of
that
stuff.
but
we're
in
a
different
age
now.
you
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i
don't
think
congress
when
it
passes
a
statute
like
this
assumes
that
there's
some
brooding
federal
law
that
governs
all
of
this
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
think
they
assume
there's
a
body
of
state
common
law,
state
by
state,
and
that
the
rights
of
parties
on
financial
transactions
are
going
to
be
determined
by
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
why
they
have
exceptions
in
there.
they
have
some
specific
rules
eliminating
certain
defenses
because
they
think
those
are
important
enough
that
they're
willing
to
override
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
assume
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
at
all
costs.
i
mean,
this
is
the
old
argument
that
since
an
act
has
some
purpose,
anything
that
impedes
that
purpose
has
to
be
overridden.
nobody
enacts
legislation
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
--things
that
they
already
know.
isn't
that
a
new
duty?
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever.
doesn't
that
constitute
a
new
duty,
a
duty
that
they
didn't
have
before?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
duty
is
the
same,
it's
just
that
people
who
didn't
used
to
be
able
to
sue
for
the
violation
of
that
duty
can
now
sue
for
the
violation
of
that
duty.
that's
a
pretty
big
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
bank?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
the
creditors.
i'm
talking
about
the
bank
or
the
fdic,
which
is
now
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
we
wouldn't
have
this
suit,
i
suppose,
if
the
provision
read
that
fdic
shall
acquire
all
rights
of
the
depositors,
as
opposed
to
saying,
all
rights
of
the
bank.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lee--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
there's
always
to
some
extent
mixing
and
matching.
i
don't
know
any
federal
common
law
scheme
that...
individual
property
rights,
for
example,
are
still
always
determined
by
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
always
some
mixing
and
matching.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
law
firm,
represented
a
california
savings
and
loan
association
in
certain
real
estate
syndications
which
turned
out
to
be
fraudulent
on
the
part
of
the
s&l.
the
s&l
later
became
insolvent
and
the
respondent
in
this
case,
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
became
the
receiver
of
the
s&l.
the
fdic
caused
the
s&l
to
make
refunds
to
the
investors
in
the
fraudulent
real
estate
syndications
and
then
filed
suit
against
the
petitioner
in
federal
district
court
alleging
state
causes
of
action
for
professional
negligence
and
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
the
petitioner
moved
for
summary
judgment
alleging
that
the
s&l
officers
knew
of
the
fraudulent
conduct
that
knowledge
must
be
imputed
under
california
law
to
the
snl
and
also
to
the
fdic
which
as
receiver
stood
in
the
s&l's
shoes,
and
that
because
of
the
imputed
knowledge
the
fdic
was
estooped
from
pursuing
the
tort
claims.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
stating
that
a
federal
common
law
rule
of
decision
control.
in
the
unanimous
decision
announced
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
california
rule
of
decision
rather
than
any
federal
rule
governs
petitioner's
tort
liability.
state
law
governs
the
imputation
of
corporate
officer's
knowledge
to
a
corporation
that
is
asserting
state
law
causes
of
action.
there
is
no
federal
general
common
law
and
the
remote
possibility
that
a
corporation
may
go
into
federal
receivership
is
no
basis
for
adapting
a
special
federal
common
law
rule
that
would
divest
states
of
authority
over
the
entire
law
of
imputation.
likewise,
california
law
governs
the
narrower
question
whether
corporate
officer's
knowledge
can
be
imputed
to
the
fdic
when
it
sues
as
receiver.
this
court
will
not
adapt
a
judge-made
federal
rule
to
supplement
comprehensive
federal
regulation.
matters
that
are
left
unaddressed
in
such
a
comprehensive
scheme
are
presumably
left
to
sate
law.
section
821(d)(2)(a)(i)
of
title
12
places
the
fdic
in
the
insolvent
s&l's
shoes
to
pursue
its
claims
under
state
law
except
where
some
provision
in
the
extensive
framework
of
the
financial
institutions
reform,
recovery,
and
enforcement
act
of
1989,
more
commonly
known
as
firrea,
specifically
creates
a
federal
rule
of
decision.
firrea
created
no
federal
rule
of
decision
that
governs
in
this
case.
finally,
judicial
creation
of
a
special
federal
rule
of
decision
would
not
be
justified
even
if
firrea
is
inapplicable
to
the
instant
receivership
which
began
in
1986
three
years
before
firrea
was
passed.
instances
where
a
special
federal
rule
is
warranted
are
few
and
restricted
limited
to
situations
where
there
is
a
significant
conflict
between
some
federal
policy
or
interest
and
the
application
of
state
law.
the
fdic
has
identified
no
such
conflict
here.
the
parties
to
the
case
are
in
agreement
that
if
state
law
does
govern,
it
is
california
law
but
they
disagree
to
what
that
law
provides.
we
leave
it
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
resolve
that
point.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
blackmun,
o'connor,
and
souter
join.
