mr.
lee--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
you
tell
us
preliminarily
whether
the
ninth
circuit
made
any
determination
of
the
content
of
california
law,
because
if
it
did
not,
perhaps
it
might
on
remand
and
a
conflict
would
be
unnecessary.
there
would
be
no
conflict.
you
presented
a
question,
is
it
state
or
federal
law,
but
if
the
content
of
both
is
the
same,
then
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lee,
can
you
give
us
instances
in
which
this
court
functions
as
a
court
of
first
view,
which
is
essentially
what
you're
asking
us
to
do?
the
ninth
circuit...
instead
of
asking
the
ninth
circuit
to
determine
the
content
of
california
law,
you're
asking
this
court
to
decide
a
question
not
on
review
but
as
a
mater
of
first
view.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bender,
would
you
clarify,
because
justice
kennedy's
question
raised
a
point
that
i
didn't
think
you
were
contesting,
that
the
claim
initially...
the
claim
for
negligence
against
the
law
firm
arises
under
state
law,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
borrow...
even
the
initial
claim,
it's
just
the
federal
law
picking
up
the
state
law,
even
though
this
is
successor
liability.
this
is
a
receiver
succeeding
to
a
claim
that
allegedly
the
bank
had.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
bank
had
a
claim,
it
was
under
california
law--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
under
federal
law,
but
you
say
that
claim
that
the
bank
had
then
gets
transformed
into
a
federal
claim
and
if
the
state
law
continues
to
apply
it's
only
by
grace
of
the
federal
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bender,
this
goes
back
to
a
question
that
was
raised
in
the
course
of
mr.
lee's
argument,
is
this
conflict
really
necessary?
if
the
state
and
federal
law
are
the
same
on
the
point,
then
why
should
we,
at
least
in
this
case,
resolve
this
question
of
what
if
the
state
law
were
different,
then
would
it
be
displaced
by
federal
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
attempt,
mr.
bender,
in
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
that
was
indeed
the
content
of
california
law,
so
you
don't
need
to...
you
don't
need
to
displace
california
law?
we
can't
tell
from
the
summary
judgment
that's
included
in
the
appendix
what
the
district
court
went
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
some
other
states.
