justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
lee,
on
1821,
do
your
california
cases
address
the
question
whether
this
defense
would
be
available
if
the
suit
had
been
brought
by
a
depositor
as
opposed
to
the
bank?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
is
it
not
fair
to
say
that
the
state
law
is
unclear
on
the
precise
issue
that
we
have
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
the
statute
say
precisely
that,
it
succeeds
to
all
rights,
titles,
powers,
and
so
forth,
of
the
institution,
and
of
any
stockholder,
member,
account-holder,
depositor,
and
so
forth?
