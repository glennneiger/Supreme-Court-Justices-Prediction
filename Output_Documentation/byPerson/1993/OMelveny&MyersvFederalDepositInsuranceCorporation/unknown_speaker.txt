mr.

with
regard
to
the
second,
we
have
heard
nothing
in
response
to
what
this
court
said
in
kimbell
foods
that
there
are
two
other
purposes
that
underlie
these
federal
insurance
statutes,
and
these
federal
insurance
statutes
do
have
other
purposes.
and
with
regard
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
as
to
how
the
taxpayers
and
the
citizens
will
ultimately
be
served,
let
me
just
turn
mr.
bender's
point
around
and
ask
us
to
put
ourselves
in
the
position
of
the
o'melveny
partners
when
the
next
case
comes
up
in
which
they're
asked
to
represent
a
savings
and
loan
and
the
ninth
circuit
law
still
remains
in
place.
probably
the
reaction
is
going
to
be,
we
don't
know
what
law
is
going
to
apply,
we
don't
know
what
has
happened,
we
have
no...
absolutely
no
indication
at
this
time
of
any
wrongdoing,
and
we
certainly
didn't
in
this
instance,
let's
just
stay
out
of
it
altogether.
or
at
the
very
least,
if
we
get
into
it,
the
price
is
going
to
have
to
go
up.
either
way,
ultimately,
it's
the
public
that
will
pay.
now,
finally,
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
from
the
briefs
and
from
this
argument
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
must
be
reversed.
they
erred.
they
erred
in
holding
that
it
was
federal
rather
than
state
law
that
applied.
the
only
question
is,
should
it
be
remanded,
or
should
this
court
just
make
final
disposition
of
the
case?
i
submit
that
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
what
california
law
is,
and
if
the
court
will
permit,
i
will
simply...
well,
i
won't
read
it.
i
will
simply
refer
you
to
west
american
financial,
which
states
very
clearly
there
is
an
exception
governing
the
circumstance
where
the
agent
is
acting
on
his
own
behalf,
but
there
is
also
an
exception
to
the
exception,
and
that
exception
to
the
exception
applies
where
the
agent
is
in
fact
acting
for
his
principal,
and
that's
on
page
969
of
that
opinion.
mr.
lee,
what's
your
best
example
of
this
court
reaching
out
to
decide
a
question
of
state
law
contrary
to
what
the
alleged
federal
common
law
rule
would
be,
contrary
to
what
is
the
law
in
many
other
states?
