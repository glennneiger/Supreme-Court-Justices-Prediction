justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
defense
that
is
at
issue
here
is
essentially
an
equitable
defense,
and
as
such
is
essentially
a
personal
defense,
and
therefore
the
cause
of
action
may
pass
but
the
defense
doesn't
necessarily
pass
with
it.
is
that
a
fair
objection
to
the
argument
from
california
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
flattered.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
bender,
before
you
get
to
the
fdic's
position,
isn't
it
true
that
so
far
as
california
law
is
concerned...
leaving
aside
the
california
law
that
determines
what
defenses
will
be
recognized,
isn't
it
true
that
under
california
law,
so
far
as
the
injury
that
the
fdic
is
trying
to
recover
for,
there's
but-for
causation
in
the
law
firm's
failure,
but
there's
not
proximate
causation,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
further
question
anyway.
if,
under
california
law,
the
california
view
of
proximate
causation
would
be
that
under
these
circumstances
no
proximate
cause,
would
you
take
the
position
that
that
rule
should
yield
to
a
uniform
federal
rule,
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
the
government
is
always
presumably
acting
on
behalf
of
citizens,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
by
substituting
whatever
furthers
the
interest
disclosed
by
the
statute
for
whatever
favors
the
federal
government
really
isn't
a
substitution
at
all.
you're
saying,
whatever
gets
us...
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
whatever
gets
us
the
greatest
recovery,
or
the
greatest
measure
of
success,
however
it's
going
to
be
measured,
is
going
to
be
the
criterion
for
picking
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
never
want
to
recover
more
than
100
percent,
so
once
again,
i
don't
see
the
distinction
that
you're
making.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
argument
seems
to
me
simply
to
boil
down
to
the
fact
that
there
ought
to
be
a
federal
common
law
rule
whenever
the
state
common
law
rule
isn't
good
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
there
intrinsic
in
your
argument
that
addresses
the
need
for
a
common
law
rule
as
distinct
from
the
need
to
amend
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
rabbit
is
coming
out
of
the
hat,
but
i
mean,
you
put
the
rabbit
in
the
hat.
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
nobody
could
identify
that
common
law,
nobody
could
identify
that
debt
until
we
first
apply
the
statute
and
find
some
deficiency
in
the
statute,
and
then
we
say,
aha,
there
must
have
been
the
bed
of
common
law
that
was
assumed
to
prevent
this
unfortunate
result.
justice
david
h.
souter
you've
got
to
be
able
to
discover
it
some
way
other
than
in
order
to
chink
up
whatever's
wrong
in
your
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
a
good
argument
simply
for
concluding
that
the
feds
take
the
common
law
as
it
was,
including
the
common
law
defenses,
and
you
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bender,
you
said
a
second
ago
that
the
point
here
is
to
prevent
the
defense
from
being
used
against
someone
against
whom
under
state
law
it
couldn't
have
been
used.
mr.
lee's
argument
was
that
you
succeeded
to
rights
and
not
to
claims,
and
so
that
in
fact
the
right
is
determined
by
reference
to
those
against
whom
the
defense
would
in
fact
have
been
assertable
under
state
law.
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
the
claim
is...
the
relevant
claim
is
the
depositors'
claim,
not
the
bank.
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
bender,
was
it
in
firrea
that
they
specifically
provided
for
directors'
liability
in
certain
cases
where
the
liability
might
have
been
doubtful
under
state
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
a
pretty
good
reason
to
assume
that
congress
did
it's
picking
and
choosing
when
it
decided
the
extent
to
which
state
common
law
might
need
to
be
modified
to
protect
the
federal
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
didn't
it
do
it...
i
may
be
wrong
on
this,
but
didn't
it
do
it
at
least
on
an
arguably
more...
on
a
standard
of
liability
that
was
arguably
more
onerous
to
the
directors
than
any
standard
of
liability
at
common
law
that
would
have
sufficed
for
recovery?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
