we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-489,
o'melveny
&
myers
v.
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
you
don't
challenge,
i
take
it,
the
ninth
circuit's
view
that
a
law
firm
in
this
situation
is
under
a
duty
of
inquiry
when
it
prepares
a
private
prospectus
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
not
asking
us
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lee.
mr.
bender,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fdic
isn't
claiming
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
on
the
land.
it's
just
claiming
its
broker's
fees
and
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
just
really
picking
whatever
favors
the
government
out
of
california
law,
then.
you're
saying,
we
like
the
california
standard
of
negligence,
so
we
accept
that,
but
we
don't
like
what
might
be
the
california
standard
of
causation,
so
we
reject
that.
is
there
anything
more
principled
than
just
whatever
favors
the
government
in
your--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
it
state
law,
then,
rather
than
federal
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
that's
just
grabbing
whatever
is
best
for
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
your
arguments,
as
justice
scalia
suggest,
don't
show
why
the
federal
government
here
is
in
any
different
position
than
anyone
else
who
might
have
been
hurt
by
this
sort
of
transaction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
there
be
a
special
rule
for
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
mr.
lee,
you
have
9
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
93-489,
o'melveny
&
myers
versus
fdic
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
