justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
you
are
satisfied
that
california
law
is
what
governs
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
any
state
law
governs--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it's
california.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
the
law
of
california,
and
do
we
know
what
the
law
of
california
is
on
the
imputation
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
ninth
circuit--
--mr.
lee--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--there
are
very
few
cases
on
this
imputation
defense,
and
it
doesn't
seem
all
that
clear
to
me
what
the
california
law
might
be
in
any
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lee--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think
that
under
your
theory
of
firrea
that
the
d'oench,
duhme
case
could
survive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
purpose
of
the
imputation
defense?
is
it
to
make
sure
that
the
wrongdoers
don't
benefit?
is
that
why
there
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--an
imputation
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
agree,
then,
that
the
purpose
of
the
defense
would
be
so
that
sahni
and
day
wouldn't
benefit
from
any
recovery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
who
would
benefit
from
a
recovery
here?
would
it
be
the
taxpayers
of
the
united
states,
or
who?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
state
law
with
regard
to
the
imputation
defense
in
these
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
why
do
we
need
a
federal
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wouldn't
you
think
normally
the
court
would
determine
what
the
state
law
is
before
deciding
such
a
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
we
should
just
send
it
back.
