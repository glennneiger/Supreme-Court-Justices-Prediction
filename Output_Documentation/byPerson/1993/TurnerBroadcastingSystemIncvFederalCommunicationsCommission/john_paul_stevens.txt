how
many--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
is
the
maximum
number
of
local
channels
that
realistically
a
cable
company
might
be
compelled
to
carry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
are
that
many
local
stations
that
want
to
be...
that
would
request
access.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
in
most
markets
there
wouldn't
be
that
many.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
extent
that's
true,
aren't
you
saying
the
must-carry
rules
just...
largely
just
make
the
cable
companies
carry
what
they'd
carry
anyway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
maybe
the
fight
isn't
quite
as
serious
as
it
sounds
on
the
surface.

mr.
farr,
as
i
understand
your
argument
this
morning,
you
pretty
much
are
saying
that
even
if
we
accept
all
the
congressional
findings,
you
should
prevail
on
the
theory
you've
been
advancing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
agree
it's
not
viewpoint
discriminatory.
