mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
defends
the
must-carry
law
primarily
by
analogy
to
the
antitrust
laws,
saying
that
it
protects
the
broadcast
system
from
anticompetitive
actions
by
cable
operators,
but
there
is
a
critical
flaw
in
this
argument.
the
law
does
not
just
prohibit
anticompetitive
activity.
it
prohibits
all
decisions
not
to
carry
broadcast
stations
for
whatever
reason
the
cable
operator
may
choose.
thus,
we
submit,
the
government
must
put
forth
an
interest
to
justify
what
the
law
actually
does,
which
is
to
override
all
editorial
discretion
with
regard
to
carriage
of
broadcast
stations,
and
we
further
submit
that
neither
interest
put
forward
by
the
government
can
meet
that
burden.
first,
an
interest
in
promoting
particular
programming
does
not
meet
the
burden,
because
government
can't
generally
promote
speech
that
it
favors
by
the
means
of
ordering
others
to
carry
it,
or
by
discriminating
against
disfavored
speech,
and
the
interest
in
protecting
the
economic
viability
of
the
broadcast
system
as
a
whole
does
not
support
the
law,
because
even
without
must-carry,
cable
systems
carry
the
vast
majority
of
broadcast
stations,
and
the
broadcast
system
is
concededly
thriving.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
the
government--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
government
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
cable
operators
like
other
businesses,
including
like
other
members
of
the
press,
do
not
make
decisions
about
what
to
carry
on
an
anticompetitive
basis,
and
if
the
law
was
narrowly
directed
to
that
problem,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
case
would
be
different,
but
the
law
is
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
completely
agree
with
judge
williams
on
the
idea
that
least
access
channels
are
a
less
restrictive
alternative
for
two
reasons,
even
though,
quite
frankly,
it
is
in
one
sense
a
helpful
argument
to
us.
the
first
is
that
even
least
access
doesn't
require
any
showing
of
anticompetitive
behavior
by
the
cable
operators.
it
is
again
a
law
that
is
directed
to
all
cable
operators
and
simply
removes
discretion
from
those
operators
to
program
particular
channels,
whether
they've
ever
engaged
in
any
economic
misconduct
or
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
it
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--although
i
wouldn't
concede
it,
i
suppose
it
is
possible
that
at
one
time
that
is
something
that
could
have
been
considered,
but
now
we
have
a
system
with
operating
cable
systems
which--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
that's
correct,
and
as
i'm
saying,
i
have
a
difficulty--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct,
i
do.
i
think
at
least
to
the
extent
that
one
is
saying
we're
going
to
take--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
is
not
unconstitutional
for
telephone
companies,
because
they
are
not
essentially
engaged
in
the
business
of
providing
news,
information,
speech
of
that
nature
to
the
public.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
what...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
particular
activity
that
the
must-carry
law
is
aimed
at
is
choice
of
material
to
be
carried
on
a
cable
system.
the
cable
operator
has
a
choice
of
a
number
of
different
sources
from
which
it
can
obtain
programming,
including,
as
you
suggest,
justice
souter,
creating
its
own
programming,
and
what
the
must-carry
law
deliberately
aims
at
doing
is
saying
when
you
make
that
choice
you
must
make
it
in
a
way
that
the
government
directly
controls,
and
not
because
the
government
is
saying
you're
engaging
in
some
anticompetitive
behavior,
simply
because
the
government
wants
you
to
make
a
different
choice.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
1)
the
term
editorial
discretion
means
a
particular
thing.
it
means
that
a
business
which
is
engaged
in
providing
speech
to
the
public,
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
that's
what
cable
systems
do,
is
in
fact
making
decisions
about
what
material
it
would
be,
whether
it
is
public
television
stations,
alternative
to
public
television
stations--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
they
are
not
deciding
each
moment
of
the
day
what
is
put
on
a
particular
channel.
that
is
something
that
the
programmer
itself
does.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
to
begin
with,
the
term
"editorial
discretion"
is
a
term
that
this
court
has
used
in
preferred
and
other
cases
with
respect
to
what
the
cable
operators
are
doing,
so
i'm
not
simply
creating
it
out
of
thin
air,
but
i
think
it
is
an
entrepreneurial
decision
in
the
sense
that
any
member
of
the
media
who
is
choosing
speech
is
choosing
it
in
part,
at
least,
for
entrepreneurial
reasons.
the
question
is,
what,
in
fact,
do
the
subscribers
to
a
cable
system,
the
readers
to
a
newspaper,
the
patrons
of
a
bookstore
or
a
movie
theater...
what
will
interest
them?
what
will
they
come
to
see,
what
will
they
pay
money
to
see
or
hear?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it's
a
combination
of
the
two.
it
seems
to
me
that
any
member
of
the
media
can
make
decisions,
and
to
say,
for
example,
that
we
are
simply
going
to
say
that
you
are
making
a
decision
for
an
economic
reason,
if
a
newspaper
decides
that
it's
going
to
carry
a
particular
political
cartoonist
because
that
political
cartoonist
is
popular
and
that
will
increase
circulation,
that
may
be
entirely
a
business
decision,
but
that's
certainly
something
we
don't
think
the
government
can
step
in
a
preempt.
so
the...
indeed,
this
goes
very
much
to
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make,
which
is
it
seems
to
me
that
government
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
saying,
when
you
are
acting
in
a
way
that
we
typically
prohibit
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
laws
that
regulate
competition,
then
when
we
tell
you
that
you
can't
exercise
your
discretion
for
that
reason
in
order
to
injure
somebody
anticompetitively,
then
we
have
the
power
to
impose
some
regulation.
but
when
government
goes
further
and
says,
we're
going
to
control
all
of
your
decision-making
with
respect
to
a
particular
subject,
whether
you're
acting
anticompetitively
or
not,
then
it
seems
to
me
to
have
crossed
a
very
important
line.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that
is
a
closer
question,
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
difficulty
that
i
have
with
least
access
from
the
standpoint
of
cable
systems
is
that,
like
the
must-carry
law,
it
does
take
away
the
discretion
to
program
particular
channels,
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
it
doesn't
do
that
based
on
any
determination
that
there
is
anticompetitive
activity.
it
simply
makes
the
decision
that
we
are
going
to
preempt
the
programming
for
those
channels.
what
it
does
not
have
is
the
element
of
pure
discrimination
against
particular
programmers
and
in
favor
of
other
programmers,
so
in
that
sense
it
does
not
have
one
of
the
evils
that
the
must-carry
law
has.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
would
not
put
them
specifically
on
a
par,
because
i
think
it
still
is
a
particular
discrimination
in
favor
of
identified
speakers,
and
i
think
it
would
be
illusory,
frankly,
to
assume
that
government
is
not
generally
aware
of
what
speech
on
broadcast
station
consists
of.
indeed,
even
apart
from
particular
regulation
by
the
fcc,
there
are
specific
laws
that
congress
has
enacted
that
deal
with
programming
on
broadcast
stations,
so
i
would
still
have
concern--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--in
the
sense
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
for
example,
if
i
understand
the
question,
justice
souter,
a
law
that
says
that
a
broadcast
station
cannot
have
indecent
material,
let's
say,
that
is
a
law
that
applies
to
broadcast
stations
throughout
the
country,
so
congress
could
know
that
if
it's
expressing
a
preference
for
broadcast
stations,
that
it
is
therefore
at
the
same
time
really
expressing
a
preference
for
stations
that
are
subject
to
that
law
and
that
restriction
on
their
speech
in
ways
that
other
possible
programmers
would
not
be.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
they
are
not
subject
to
some
of
the
same
restrictions
on
their
speech
that
broadcast
stations
are,
and
i
think
that
is
because
they
do
not
share
the
physical...
the
spectrum
and
the
physical
scarcity
rationale
has
not
been
applied
to
them.
the
congress
has
not
done
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
give
them
much
leeway
in
that
regard,
quite
honestly.
i
mean,
i
think
if
what
government
is
doing
is
essentially
trying
to
use
a
franchising
process
where
there
is
perfectly
adequate
room
for
other
cable
operators
to
function,
because
there's
plenty
of
space
on
the
rights
of
way
for
additional
lines
or
additional
cable,
if
government
is
using
that
process
as
a
way
to
start
to
press
for
distinctions
in
speech,
then
i
find
that
troubling.
now,
i
think
it's
probably
unrealistic
to
assume
that
when
local
governments
are
considering
applications,
that
they
don't
take
into
account
something
on
the
grounds
of
content,
but
my
general
feeling
is
that
that
should
be
at
a
very,
very
attenuated
level
if
it's
permitted
at
all.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
assuming
the
premise,
i
think
it
is
possible
that
there
is
some
very
modest
leeway
for
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
because...
first
of
all
because
i
do
quarrel
with
the
premise,
quite
honestly.
when--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
i
think
the
premise
is
important,
too,
and
i
mean...
i
will
accept
it,
but
i
think
the
premise
is
important
to
it,
because
the
question
that
one
is
always
asking
when
one
is
extending
government
leeway
to
get
into
content
is,
why
are
we
allowing
government
to
do
this?
typically,
government
is
not
allowed
to
do
it,
so
if
the
answer
is,
because
we
have
no
choice,
essentially
government
is
in
a
position,
as
it
is
in
the
broadcasting
situation,
where
there
is
a
spectrum
which
can
only
accommodate
so
many
speakers,
and
the
government
therefore
has
to
shut
down
other
speakers,
has
to
silence
particular
speech,
then
the
government
has
been
accorded
some
greater
leeway
with
respect
to
the
speech
that
gets
on.
that
really
doesn't
exist
with
cable
operators,
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
if
the
local
government
says,
we're
only
going
to
have
one
cable
system,
something
which
i
point
out
congress
has
now
prohibited
in
the
1992
act,
but
if
they
say
that,
really
they're
using
one
power,
the
power
to
grant
rights
of
way,
to
essentially
leverage
themselves
into
a
second
power
to
control
content,
and
i
do
find
that
troubling.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
no,
i
would
not
suggest
that
cities
have
that
obligation
to
allow
all-comers
to
come
in.
i
mean,
essentially
that's
the
issue
that
the
court--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--had
before
it
in
preferred.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
when
the
city
says
that,
and
there
is
no
absolute
requirement
that
the
city
has
to
take
one
in
the
sense
that
it
could
easily
accommodate
others,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
city's
power
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
content
is
very
limited,
if
it
exists
at
all.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
has
to
take
all
10.
i'm
saying
that
its
basis
for
choosing
among
them
cannot
be
dictated
by
its
views
about
the
content
of
programming.
if,
for
example,
they
say,
we
will
accept...
we
will
give
preference
in
the
application
process
to
cable
operators
who
agree
that
they
will
not
show
the
following
25
cable
networks,
they
will
go
into
an
upper
tier
if
they
agree
not
to
show
these,
i
think
that
would
be
impermissible.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
it
changes
part
of
it.
i
think
what
clearly
is
happening
in
the
communications
world
is
there
are
a
number
of
new
technologies,
which
means
that
the
opportunities
for
those
who
want
to
reach
the
public
are
greatly
increasing,
and
i
think
they're
going
to
accelerate
in
the
next
10
or
15
years.
in
the
particular
scarcity
rationale,
really
the
only
scarcity
rationale
that
this
court
has
recognized,
deals
with
one
specific
thing,
which
is
the
electromagnetic
spectrum,
and
the
limitations
on
assigning
licenses
based
on
frequencies
in
the
spectrum,
that
spectrum
is
not
really
changing,
so
in
that
sense
there
still
is
physical
scarcity.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
difficult
question
in
the
broadcast
context,
none
of
which,
i
hasten
to
point
out,
applies
to
cable,
is,
even
if
you
still
have
scarcity
of
the
spectrum,
given
all
the
other
ways
that
people
can
reach
the
public
through
other
technologies,
is
the
regulation
that
has
been
premised
on
the
scarcity
still
justified,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
question
that
the
court
has
suggested
that
it
is
at
some
point
willing
to
reconsider
in
league
of
women
voters.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it's
possible
in
the
future,
justice
ginsburg,
there
may
be
a
situation
where
essentially
the
ability
of
all
programmers
to
reach
the
public
through
a
cable
system
is
essentially
not
foreclosed
by
a
law
like
the
must-carry
law,
but
i
would
have
a
couple
of
comments.
first
of
all,
obviously
we're
not
at
that
position
now.
the
must-carry
law
applies
today,
and
nobody
disputes
the
fact
that
most
cable
systems
have
a
definitely
defined
capacity
which
is
already
filled
up,
and
therefore
any
inclusion
of
broadcast
stations
necessarily
means
the
exclusion
of
some
other
programmer.
secondly,
of
course,
the
hard
thing
to
speculate
about
is,
if
at
a
time
when
the
average
cable
system
has
200
channels,
it
may
be
that
there
are
400
programming
services,
because
programming
services
have
expanded
to
meet
the
expansion
in
channel
capacity
of
cable
systems
as
that
has
occurred,
so
i
think
it's
hard
to
say,
even
in
the
abstract,
that
in
the
future
when
there
are
more
channels,
that
a
preference
for
a
particular
kind
of
programming
imposed
on
operators
will
not
be
troublesome,
because
there
still
may
be
the
same
need
to
make
choices--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--just
in
larger
numbers.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
don't
have
a
precise
answer
to
that.
i
think
we're
talking
somewhere
in
the
15
to
20
range,
depending...
it
depends,
because--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
many
stations
total?
you
have
vhf
stations,
you
have
uhf
stations,
if
that
doesn't
fill
up
your
number,
then
you
have
low
power
which
you're
required
to
carry
as
well,
so
the
number
actually
does
fill
up
fairly
quickly,
so
i
think
it
is
basically
correct,
although
i
can't
say
this
with
absolute
assurance,
that
most
cable
systems
subject
to
must-carry
are
finding
that,
through
the
combination
of
stations
that
are
being
carried
through
retransmission
consent,
and
those
carried
pursuant
to
must-carry,
they
are
filling
up
their
limit.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that...
certainly
there
are
specific
findings,
justice
kennedy,
about
the
public
television
station's
content,
although
there
are
still
findings
of
a
slightly
less
specific
nature
about
the
commercial
stations,
so
frankly
i
don't
make
much
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
don't
think
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
doctrine
permits
choices
by
cable
operators,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
expect,
based
on
history,
that
in
fact
cable
operators
aren't
interested
in
providing
programming
that
people
want
to
see
anyway.
most
cable
operators
voluntarily,
without
must-carry,
since
1986,
when
the
rules
were
struck
down,
have
carried
the
vast
majority
of
stations.
i
mean,
95
to
98
percent...
as
an
affidavit
that
we
submitted
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
305
suggests,
98
percent
of
the
stations
have
been
voluntarily
carried,
including
public
television
stations.
why?
because
there
is
in
fact
a
demand.
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
programming
on
public
television
stations
that
the
public
wants
and
the
one
thing
it
seems
to
me
that
is
clear
is
that
cable
systems
have
the
primary
incentive
to
provide
programming
that
the
subscribers
want,
rather
than
incentives
to
drop
broadcast
stations
for
other
reasons.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that's
correct,
in
a
sense,
justice
stevens.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it's
serious
in
one
sense.
i
mean,
if
we're
saying
that
this
is
going
to
dramatically
change
the
face
of
television,
whether
must-carry
stands
or
doesn't
stand,
i
don't
think
it
will,
for
exactly
the
reason
that
i'm
saying.
on
the
other
hands,
i
do
think
there
is
a
very
real
difference
between
a
voluntary
decision
to
utter
speech,
to
use
the
term
in
first
amendment
language,
and
being
compelled
to
do
so,
and
i
assume
that,
for
example,
most
people
voluntarily
say
the
pledge
of
allegiance,
but
i
think
then
when
government
says,
even
if
you
would
voluntarily
say
it,
or
even
if
most
people
would
voluntarily
say
it,
we're
going
to
make
it
a
matter
of
compulsion,
then
they
have
crossed
over
into
an
area
of
unconstitutionality.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
would
be
true,
that
this
law
is
not
tailored
to
anticompetitive
activity,
and
it
is
based
specifically
on
discrimination
among
different
programmers,
and
that
itself
is
enough
to
make
the
law
invalid.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the
problem
is,
simply
making
findings
about
the
threat
to
competition,
even
if
they
were
better
substantiated
than
these
findings,
which
show
that
in
fact
the
stations
are
being
carried,
they're
not
being
dropped
in
order
to
get
advertising
revenues,
more
broadcast
stations
are
in
fact
carried
on
cable
systems
now
than
when
there
was
must-carry.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
the
difficulty
that
they
would
not
cure
by
simply
going
back
and
simply
reenacting
the
same
law
with
anticompetitive
findings
is
the
point
that
i
made
precisely
at
the
outset.
this
is
not
a
law
directed
specifically
at
anticompetitive
conduct.
it's
not
tailored
to
that
problem.
so
as
long
as
the
law
reaches
all
decision-making
with
respect
to
broadcast
stations,
not
simply
decision-making
for
anticompetitive
reasons,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
findings
congress
makes,
it
is
not
justifying
the
law
on
that
basis.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
briefly
address,
if
i
may,
a
few
of
the
points
of
the
economic
theory
on
which
the
government
is
relying.
first
of
all,
i
could
not
emphasize
more
strongly
that
this
is
not
a
law
that
is
tailored
to
the
economic
problem
that
the
government
is
talking
about.
it's
the
problem
set
out
at
findings
15
and
16
at
6
and
7
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
that
cable
operators
will
drop
popular
programming
in
order
to
divert
advertising
revenues.
that's
the
theory
on
which
it
is
based.
but
the
law
does
not
prohibit
cable
operators
from
dropping
broadcast
stations
for
that
reason.
it
prohibits
them
from
dropping
them
for
any
reason,
however
protected
that
might
be
in
first
amendment
terms.
but
second,
if
one
looks
at
this
practice
which
the
government
has
identified
and
the
supposed
threat
to
the
local
broadcast
system,
which
is
what
is
predicted
in
finding
16,
there
are
two
immediate
problems
with
it.
first
of
all,
as
i
have
said,
7
years
of
experience
without
must
carry
show
that
in
fact
cable
operators
drop
very
few
broadcast
stations,
and
of
course,
even
the
numbers
that
are
shown
by
the
government
don't
reflect
the
fact
that
cable
operators
also
drop
cable
stations.
they're
changing
their
programming
as
time
goes
on,
so
many
cable
programmers
have
been
dropped
during
this
period,
too,
from
particular
stations.
but
in
addition
to
that
they
carry
virtually
all
stations.
they
carry
the
most
popular
stations,
which
are
their
greatest
competitors
for
advertising
revenues.
the
ftc
staff
study
that
we
lodged
with
the
court
last
week
shows
that,
of
the
stations
that
are
dropped,
they
either
don't
compete
for
advertising
because
they're
public
tv
stations,
or
in
fact
they
are
very
little
watched,
so
they
are
very
weak
competitors
for
advertising.
and
overall
the
number
of
stations
carried
on
broadcast
systems
has
gone
up,
and
congress
clearly
expects
this
to
continue,
because
in
section
6,
the
retransmission
consent
provision,
it
gave
broadcast
stations
the
right
to
demand
payment
for
carriage,
so
obviously
the
incentive
to
carry
popular
programming
for
subscribers,
where
most
of
the
money
comes
from,
is
much
greater
than
any
incentive
to
drop
stations
in
order
to
get
advertising
revenues.
i'd
like
to
make
two
other
brief
points.
first
of
all,
there
has
been
discussion
about
the
term,
content-related,
and
i
would
simply
like
to
say,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
has
two
different
meanings,
both
of
which
are
implicated
in
this
case.
this
law
is
content-related
in
one
sense
because
it
specifically
dictates
the
kind
of
programming,
or
at
least
who
provides
the
programming
that
is
seen
on
somebody's
television
screen,
so
it
is
putting
this
programming
on
instead
of
this
programming,
the
programmer
who
is
knocked
off.
second,
the
reason
it's
doing
that
is
also
content-based,
because
congress,
as
the
findings
suggest,
has
a
preference
for
local
programming,
for
the
kind
of
programming
seen
on
public
tv
stations
specifically.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it's
not
viewpoint
discriminatory.
thank
you,
your
honor.
