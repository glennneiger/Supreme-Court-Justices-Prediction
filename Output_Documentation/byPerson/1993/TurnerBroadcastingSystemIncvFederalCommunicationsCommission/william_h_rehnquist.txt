chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
93-44,
the
turner
broadcasting
system,
inc.
v.
federal
communications
commission.
mr.
farr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that's
essentially
an
economic
decision,
not
a
literary
or
choice
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
farr,
let's
suppose
that
a
municipality
decides,
we
don't
want
our
telephone
poles
cluttered
with
a
lot
of
things,
so
we're
only
going
to
be
able
to
have
one
cable
television
within
the...
and
there
are
three
or
four
applicants.
now,
aren't
they
entitled
to
make
some
judgment
as
to
at
least
which
the
majority
of
the
people
in
the
municipality
might
prefer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
it
be
modest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
accept
the
premise,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
if
there
are
10
cable
companies
that
apply,
and
the
municipality
says,
we
only
want
one,
the
first
amendment
says
no,
you
have
to
take
all
10,
no
matter
how
cluttered
the
streets
get?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
okay,
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
have
a
number
of
observations
around
the
fringe,
but
how
about
the
actual
situation
where
you
have
several
applicants,
the
city
says
we're
only
going
to
take
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
10
applicants,
the
city
says
we're
only
going
to
take
one,
the
applicants
could
make
out
a
case
that
physically
with
a
lot
of
cluttering
you
might
be
able
to
take
three
or
four,
the
city
can
do
nothing,
it
has
to
take
all
10?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
farr.
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
same
argument
was
made,
or
one
much...
in
the
tornillo
case,
that
tornillo's
only
opportunity
to
have
his
views
heard
was
if
the
miami
herald
would
publish
his
letter
to
the
editor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
case
would
have
come
out
differently
if
he
could
have
shown
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
was
nothing
nearly
as
adequate
as
publishing
his
letter
to
the
editor
in
the
miami
herald
to
express
his
views
to
the
public?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
findings
to
that
effect,
to
the
effect
that
you
just
described--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--by
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
is
a
finding
by
congress
that
the
result
of
this
is
to
put
owned
subsidiaries,
owned
cables
on
at
the
expense
of
a
broadcast
station
even
though
the
broadcast
station
might
be
preferred
by
more
people?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
mr.
farr,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
93-44,
turner
broadcasting
system,
inc.
versus
federal
communications
commission
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
