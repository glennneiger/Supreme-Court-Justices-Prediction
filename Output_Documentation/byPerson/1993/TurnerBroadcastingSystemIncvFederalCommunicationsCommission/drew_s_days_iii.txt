mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
mr.
farr
wants
the
court
to
do
is
basically
ignore
significant
elements
of
the
congressional
decision
to
enact
the
1992
law.
at
least
two
things
can
be
said
with
conviction
about
the
regulation
of
electronic
media
in
the
united
states.
first,
the
federal
government
made
a
promise
to
the
american
public
in
1934
that
it
would
make
available
so
far
as
possible
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
a
rapid,
efficient,
nation-wide
and
worldwide
wire
and
radio
communications
service,
and
it
expected
that
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
promoting
that
policy
would
do
so
consistent
with
public
interest,
convenience,
or
necessity,
and
do
so
in
a
way
that
was
fair,
efficient,
and
equitable.
second,
the
electronic
media
field
has
been
from
its
beginning,
to
quote
justice
frankfurter
in
the
1943
national
broadcasting
company
case,
"a
field
of
enterprise
the
dominant
characteristic
of
which
was
the
rapid
pace
of
its
unfolding.
"
over
the
intervening
50
years,
congress
has
striven
to
strike
a
balance
in
the
best
interests
of
the
american
people
on
the
one
hand
by
developing
a
regulatory
framework
that
does
not
retard
the
growth
of
the
electronic
media
and
increased
outlets
for
expression
while
on
the
other
assuring
the
growth
of
the
electronic
media
did
not
disserve
the
goals
of
diversity
and
broad,
equitable,
and
free
geographic
distribution
of
access
to
electronic
media.
it
is
a
dynamic,
not
a
static
process
that
has
required
congress
to
be
alert
to
the
existence
and
impact
of
new
technologies.
it
is
a
process
that
goes
on
as
i
speak.
it
is
this
morning's
headline
news.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
lower
court
correctly
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
must-carry
provisions
of
the
1992
act,
finding
it
essentially
economic
regulation
designed
to
create
competitive
balance
in
the
video
industry
as
a
whole.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we
do
not.
we
think
that
in
this
case
there
is
no
focus
on
content.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we
think
it's--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
that
if
it
is
not
content-neutral
then
it
has
to
meet
a
very
exacting
test
that
this
court
has
set
out,
but
our
position
is
that
this
regulation
is
not
content-based.
it
is
content-neutral.
it
is
not
focused--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--on
the
speaker.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
not
at
all.
it
just
requires
that
the
regulation
meet
a
higher
standard
of
justification.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
the
lower
court
was
correct
in
referring
to
it
as
being
content-based
in
a
de
minimis
sense,
and
this
may
get
to
your
point,
justice
kennedy,
about
the
doctrine.
to
characterize
what
congress
has
done
here
in
promoting
the
increase
in
voices
to
provide
educational
and
constructive
video
programming
to
the
public
as
being
content-based
is
somehow
to
distort
this
court's
decisions
and
the
doctrines
that
have
developed.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
congress
is
focusing
on
what
the
speakers
are
saying.
now,
with
respect
to
section
5,
it
is
true
that
congress
made
references
to
educational
television,
but
i
think
in
only
the
most
generalized
sense.
it's
not
a
situation
where
congress
is
dictating
what
those
stations
must
carry.
in
fact,
this
court's
decisions
make
very
clear
that
educational
stations
enjoy
editorial
discretion
and
freedom.
that's
really
the
league
of
women
voters,
and
that's
also
true
with
respect
to
local
broadcasting.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
why
it
was
our
argument
on
this
particular
legislation
that
the
existing
tools
for
evaluating
it
were
really
not
adequate
to
the
task,
and
that
it
was
more
productive
not
to
look
at
the
so-called
content
related
cases
or
doctrines,
but
rather
to
look
at
those
regulations,
or
those
doctrines
that
deal
with
attempting
to
address
market
dysfunction
and
economic
scarcity,
the
inability
of
speakers
to
have
their
messages
heard
because
of
control.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we
are
not--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
is
not
our
position,
justice
ginsburg.
the
fact
that
we
relied
upon
red
lion
was
not
to
suggest
that
congress
necessarily
has
the
power
to
regulate
cable
television
in
the
same
way
that
it
does
broadcast
stations,
but
simply
to
indicate
that
the
monopoly
power
of
cable
may
justify
some
regulations
that
implicate
but
do
not
transgress
first
amendment
prohibitions.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
certainly
that
argument
was
made.
i
don't
think
the
court
actually
resolved
the
question
of
economic
scarcity,
but
the
fact
was
that
there
were
other
ways
in
which
tornillo
could
express
his
views
and
be
heard.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
saying
that
there
was
nothing
quite
so
adequate
is
not
analogous
to
this
situation.
what
congress
was
looking
at
was
basically
a
bottleneck,
a
control,
a
gatekeeper
function
that
cable
was
performing
with
respect
to
the
development
of
broadcast
television.
i
think
that
in
the
tornillo
case
what
we
would
have
to
have
is
a
situation
where
the
only
way
in
which
tornillo
could
express
himself
was
through
the
miami
herald,
or
through
the
newspaper
that
published
the
particular
article.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
justice
scalia,
certainly
that
argument
can
be
made.
there
are
problems
there,
but
again,
to
divorce
the
history
of
congress'
consideration
of
cable
television
from
what
it
did
in
1992
is
to
miss
the
point.
this
is
not
congress
deciding
one
morning
when
it
got
up
to
regulate
the
cable
tv
industry.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
there
is
the
bottleneck
insofar
as
we're
talking
about
congress'
commitment
that
i
just
mentioned
to
the
american
people
to
ensure
that
they
were
able
to
get
free
television
service.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
precisely
right.
we're
not
talking
about
the
message,
justice
scalia.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
o'connor,
it
in
our
view
is
not
difficult.
it
may
be
different,
but
not
difficult,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
nothing,
in
our
estimation,
constitutionally
improper
or
inappropriate
for
congress
to
express
its
views
on
the
importance
of
local
broadcasting...
it's
something
that
it's
been
doing
since
1934...
or
to
talk
about
educational
television.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
your
honor--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
the
point
is
that
it's
not
favoring
the
broadcast
industry
in
the
sense
of
promoting
it
plain
and
simple.
the
idea
is
to
make
broadcast
television
available
to
40
percent
of
those
households
that
do
not
have
cable,
and
also
to
make
certain
that
people
who
have
cable
get
the
quality
of
programming
that
they
deserve,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
cable
industry,
with
its
tremendous
horizontal
concentration,
vertical
concentration,
tremendous
control
over
the
market
present,
what
congress
envisioned
was,
down
the
line
before
long,
there
would
not
be
that
availability,
and
that's
why
congress
responded.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
souter,
certainly
there
were
all
kinds
of
statements
and
findings,
but
i
think
they
go
to
the
point
of
diversity.
it
was
not
congress
saying,
now,
we're
going
to
allow
local
stations
on
cable,
we're
going
to
allow
educational
stations
on
cable--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--and
we're
going
to
watch
to
make
certain
that
you
do
precisely
what
you
expected.
that
was
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
it's
been
suggested
that
this
was
perhaps
a
way
in
which
congress
could
control
the
cable
tv
industry,
but
i
think
this
court's
decisions
have
made
very
clear
that
the
editorial
discretion
of
even
broadcasters
is
fairly
broad,
and
the
fcc
and
the
congress
are
restricted
in
the
way
they
go
about
regulating
that
particular
part
of
the
media.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
certainly,
given
the
record
that
congress
has
compiled
up
to
this
point,
i
don't
want
to
preclude
congress'
looking
at
the
issue
at
a
later
stage,
but
i
think
at
this
point
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
justify
congress'
extending
its
regulation
to
cable
in
the
same
way
that
it
regulates
the
broadcast
industry.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
can
silence
people,
but
this
is
not
a
situation
where
cable
operators
are
being
silenced.
as
was
suggested
in
the
questions
about--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--but
justice
scalia,
it's
a
matter
of
reasonableness,
and
whether
it's
tailored
to
the
particular
problem
that
congress
identified,
and
it's
our
position
that
in
this
legislation
that's
what
congress
did.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
what
congress
identified
was
an
enormous
development
in
the
power
of
the
cable
tv
industry,
and
was
projecting
down
the
road
the
extent
to
which
that
power
would
overcome
the
ability
of
broadcast
tv
to
reach
the
40
percent--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
they're
not
soley
predictions.
they're
based
on
evidence
in
the
record
that
congress
considered
over
many
years
through
many
hearings
that
there
were
denials
of
carriage,
that
there
were
limitations
on
carriage,
that
stations
were
being
dropped,
that
they
were
being
repositioned...
that's
in
the
record,
and
i
think--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
that
may
be
the
case,
but
what
congress
found
was
that
there
was
an
incentive
on
the
part
of
cable
operators
to
drop
certain
stations
because
of
their
desire
to
have
greater
access
to
advertising
revenue.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
record
reflects
that
cable
operators
are
carrying
network
affiliates,
but
they
are
dropping
some
of
the
independent
stations
not
because
they
don't
have
attractiveness
to
cable
viewers,
but
because
of
the
fact
that
if
they're
dropped,
then
other
stations
can
be
brought
on,
and
those
basically
benefit
the
cable
operators.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
they're
also
able
to
use
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--they
also
are
able
to
use
that
for
their
own
programming.
there's
a
tremendous
integration
here,
cable
operators
owning
cable
programmers,
cable
programmers
owning
cable
operators.
to
that
extent,
cable
operators
do
benefit
by
dropping
some
broadcast
stations
that
are
not
affiliated
with
them.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
it's
certainly
trying--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
it's
not
a
matter
of
telling
people
who
can't
speak
and
who
can
speak.
congress
has
dealt
with
this,
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
cross-ownership
rules,
on
the
grounds
that
that
created
a
problem
within
the
marketplace
for
the
availability
of
quality
programming.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
marginal
is
the
right
way
to
describe
it.
i
think
the
record
reflects
that
even
those
independent
stations
that
have
been
dropped
or
refused
carriage
actually
have
more
of
an
attractiveness
to
viewers
than
some
of
the
cable
programs
that
are
put
on,
and
the
cable
programs
are
put
on
because
there
is
this
interlinking
relationship
that
stimulates
that
type
of
anticompetitive
practice.
that's
what
congress
felt
was
going
on.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
yes,
there
are--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
references
in
the
record.
i
can
cite
the
court,
for
example,
to
this
interrelationship
in
the
senate
report,
which
was
an
appendix
to
the
senate
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
lower
court
at
pages
00268.
there's
a
chart
that
was
before
the
congress,
indicating
top
cable
networks
owned
by
cable
operators,
top
cable
networks
not
owned
by
cable
operators,
and
this
is
part
of
a
discussion
that
was
reflected
in
this
report
in
congress
over
this
tremendous
concentration.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
a
finding
in
the
act
at
2(a)(15)
discussing
the
incentives
on
the
part
of
cable
operators
to
drop
commercial
and
noncommercial
stations.
there
are
also
other--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
know
about
the
word
impressive,
but
i
think
that
what
it
was
for
congress
was
an
indication
of
a
problem
that
ought
to
be
dealt
with
now,
rather
than
waiting
until
devastation
was
wrought
upon
the
broadcast
industry
and
companies
were
either
going
dark
or
had
so
reduced
the
quality
of
their
programming
that
they
were
not
legitimate
competitors.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
standard,
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
in
this
situation,
insofar
as
congress
is
concerned.
congress...
there
was
a
discussion
about
new
technology.
congress
was
aware
of
the
new
technology,
and
the
record
reflects
the
fact
that
fiber
optics
and
what's
called
video
compression
will
before
long
present
a
situation
where
most
cable
companies,
most
cable
operators
can
have
500
channels.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
have
any
information
to
that
effect.
i
do
know
in
talking
about
this
issue
being
as
current
as
today's
headlines
that
the
vice
president
gave
a
speech
yesterday
about
this
administration's
views
on
the
so-called
super
highway,
information
super
highway,
and
the
position
of
this
administration
has
been
that
there
be
open
access
and
program
diversity.
what
that
essentially
means
is
that,
even
with
this
new
technology,
there
will
be
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
administration,
with
the
assistance
of
congress,
to
ensure
precisely
the
types
of
things
that
congress
has
tried
to
achieve
in
the
1992
act.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
is
a
different
proposition,
but
i
think
it
goes
to
the
issues
here
in
the
sense
that
1)
we
have...
in
talking
about
the
burden
on
cable
operators,
1)
if
they're
indeed
carrying
most
of
the
stations
that
would
be
subject
to
must-carry,
there's
not
a
burden.
if,
indeed,
there's
this
increased
technology,
then
the
must-carry
responsibilities
are
also
going
to
have
less
of
an
impact.
i
think
what
it
shows
is
that
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with
the
problem
but
not
in
a
blunderbuss
fashion.
it
was
not
trying
to
make
cable
operators
common
carriers.
it
was
trying
to
use
a
very
limited
mechanism,
viewpoint
neutral,
to
deal
with
a
problem
that
had
been
identified,
and
it's
not
simply
a
matter
of
antitrust
violations
by
the
cable
industry.
it's
something
much
more
than
that.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
justice
scalia,
congress
has
tried
to
respond
to
that.
section
6
of
the
act,
which
is
disparaged
by
the
other
side,
by
the
cable
operators
and
programmers,
is
in
fact
a
way
to
allow
the
more
powerful
stations
to
negotiate
with
the
cable
operators
for
carriage,
leaving
those
who
are
not
in
the
position
with
market
power
to
negotiate
to
take
advantage
of
the
must-carry
provisions.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
just
as
an
aside,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
working
very
well,
but
again,
let's
put
this
in
context.
cable
operators
have
been
able
to
carry
broadcast
stations
free
for
a
number
of
years
with
the
assistance
of
congress.
now,
for
congress
in
1992
to
decide
that
some
stations
may
be
in
a
position
to
negotiate
with
the
cable
operators
does
not
seem
to
us
to
raise
any
major
issues
of
government
regulation
of
the
cable
industry.
this
is
a
response
to,
as
i
was
suggesting
at
the
outset,
a
very
long
relationship
between
congress
and
the
federal
government
and
the
cable
industry.
in
1958,
at
least
as
early
as
1958,
congress
recognized
the
relationship
between
what
was
called
at
the
time
catv
and
the
broadcast
stations
and
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
some
problems.
mr.
drew
s.

yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
there
are
several
answers:
1)
the
cable
operators,
or
the
cable
programmers
do
have
other
outlets.
they
can
sell
their
programs
to
broadcast
stations.
it's
not
a
matter
of
their
having
to
go
to
cable
operations.
secondly,
the
act
in
section
11,
i
believe,
actually
tries...
11
or
12...
tries
to
get
at
the
problem
that
independent
programmers
have
been
encountering,
faced
with
competition
by
affiliated
programmers,
so
that
what
congress
has
done
is
try
to
give
them
a
better
position
in
the
competition
for
access
to
these
channels,
but
there
are
public
educational
and
governmental
channels
that
have
been
given
over
that
can't
be
used
by
programmers,
there's
leased
access
that
can't
be
used
by
programmers...
this
is
an
effort
by
congress
to
deal
with
another
problem
in
the
same
way
that
it
dealt
with
the
problems
that
peg
and
the
leased
access
arrangements
did,
so
this
is
not
in
any
sense
an
effort
to
get
the
programmers.
it's
consistent
with
what
congress
has
tried
to
do
over
the
years
to
create
a
marketplace
in
which
people
who
have
televisions
without
cable,
and
people
who
have
cable
availability,
can
get
quality
program
stations
both
broadcast
and
cable
and
have
the
type
of
diversity
of
information
and
education
that,
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
congress
had
in
mind
in
1934.
before
i
close,
i'd
like
to
just
respond
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
put
to
mr.
farr.
he
was
asked
about
the
capacity
of
stations,
how
many
local
stations
would
have
to
be
carried,
and
he
said
15.
i
think
that's
very
high.
for
one
thing,
the
act
recognizes
that
there
does
not
have
to
be
duplication,
so
that
in
the
case
where
there
are
15
stations,
there's
bound
to
be
some
duplication.
congress
also
found
that
9,000
of
the
11,000
cable
operators
had
unused
capacity,
and
just
to
pick
up
in
closing
on
the
questions
about
a
municipality
and
whether
it
could
make
decisions
about
which
cable
operator
to
carry,
based
in
part
on
programming,
mr.
farr
gave
a
very
modest
response
by
suggesting
modest
regulations,
but
i
think
the
fact
is
that
what
this
case
presents,
as
do
those
hypotheticals,
is
a
situation
where
economic
regulation,
where
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
best
service
is
provided
to
a
community,
comes
into
the
decision-making
process.
thank
you.
