what
if
a
municipality
chose
or
perhaps,
if
the
federal
government
had
the
power,
the
federal
government
chose
to
say
that
all
cable
operators
must
be
merely
carriers?
we're
not
going
to
allow
anybody
to
put
copper
under
our
streets
in
order
to
carry
their
own
programs.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
be
like
the
telephone
company.
anybody
who
wants
to
use
it
may
use
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
that
any
different
from
justice
o'connor's
least
access
proposal?
it's
just
doing
it
wholesale
instead
of
for
a
limited
number
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
do
it
for
telephone
companies.
it
is
unconstitutional
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
i
guess
we
can
argue
about
judge
williams'
solution
if
and
when
it's
ever
adopted.
i
suppose
you
really
don't
have
to
fight
whether
that's
feasible
or
not,
do
you.
i
mean,
what's
happened
here
is
that
the
government
has
not
said
you
must
make
your
channels
available
to
everybody.
they've
said,
you
must
make
your
channels
available
to
this
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't
really
the
same
thing
as
what's
done
with
the
telephone
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it
seems
to
me
the
programs
that
are
aired
over
broadcast
television
have
many
other
ways
to
get
onto
the
screen,
not
to
mention
many
other
ways
of
getting
into
human
minds
through
the
print
media.
they
can
get
on
the
screen
through
cassettes
that
you
can
take
home.
they
can
get
on
the
screen
through
cable
programs
that
are
not
over
the
air.
i
don't
see
how...
it
seems
to
me
there's
much
more
scarcity
in
the
daily...
which
most
of
our
cities
have,
the
single
daily
newspaper
situation
than
there
is
in
the
cable
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
my
point
is,
we
shouldn't
look
at
this
as
the
voice
we're
trying
to
get
in
is
the
voice
of
the
over-the-air
broadcaster.
what
we're
talking
about
is
whatever
the
over-the-air
broadcaster
chooses
to
program,
and
that
can
get
to
the
viewer
through
many
other
means.
they
can
syndicate
it
in
cable
instead
of
over
the
air.
they
can
get
it
to
the
viewer
on
cassettes,
in
a
lot
of
other
ways.
i
don't
see
how
there's
this
great
bottleneck
that
you're
talking
about
for
the
individual
speaker.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
issue.
now
you're
not
talking
about
the
message,
you're
talking
about
whether
you
get
it
free
or
not,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
content,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
days,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
first
amendment
to
discriminate
with
respect
to
speakers
so
long
as
there
is
no
discrimination
with
respect
to
content?
that
is,
can
the
government
say
to
a
particular
individual,
you
can't
talk,
and
to
someone
else,
you
can
talk,
so
long
as
the
government's...
i
don't
care
what
you
say.
it's
just
that
we
don't
want
you
to
talk.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're
saying
the
broadcasters
have
to
talk,
and
that
means
that
these
other
people
who
want
the
same
space
can't
talk.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
closely
tailored
is
it?
you
say
that
there's
this
great
problem.
they're
carrying
98
percent
of
all
of
the
signals
anyway.
must
we
accept
congress'
assessment
that
there
is
a
major
market
failure
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
were
very
bad
stations
that
people
didn't
want
to
watch,
which
is
why
the
cable
systems
didn't
have
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now...
i
thought
the
ratio
for
a
cable
station
between
the
money
it
gets
from
advertising
and
the
money
it
gets
from
the
subscribers
is
25
to
1,
so
if
by
failing
to
carry
this
single
station
they
lose
1
subscriber,
they
have
to
make
up
from
advertising
25
times--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
congress
should
pass
a
law
against
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
instead
of
saying
who
can
speak
and
who
can't
speak.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is,
it
seems
to
me,
very
blunderbuss
if
you're
worried
about
broad...
i
gather
what
underlies
all
of
this
supposedly
is
that
congress
is
worried
about
some
broadcasters
not
being
able
to
make
it,
and
therefore
going
out
of
business,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
order
to
protect
against
that,
cable
systems
are
required
to
carry
even
the
richest
broadcasters,
many
of
whom
make
millions
of
dollars
a
year.
why
isn't
that
blunderbuss?
i
mean,
why
couldn't
there
been
some
system,
if
you
talk
about
narrow
tailoring,
whereby
local
broadcasters
who
can't
make
it
have
a
right
to
apply
to
be
admitted
to
cable
systems
instead
of
just
generally
saying
everybody
has
to
be
carried?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
that
narrows
the
focus.
that
just
gives
the
powerful
stations
double
advantage.
not
only
must
they
be
carried
if
they
want
to,
but
they
can
demand
money
to
be
carried
if
the
cable
wants
to
carry
them
anyway.
