but
mr.
farr,
they're
not
making
particular
decisions.
if
they're
carrying
a
program
or
they're
carrying
a
broadcaster,
they're
not
deciding
what
that
broadcaster...
each
individual
program.
they're
making
a
gross
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
one
of
the
briefs
suggested
a
better
term
would
be
an
entrepreneurial
decision
rather
than
an
editorial--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
justice
o'connor's
question
was
whether,
in
your...
based
on
your
argument,
least
access...
least
access
would
be
equally
unconstitutional.
you're
arguing
that
must-carry
is
unconstitutional.
would
least
access,
as
a
substitute
for
it,
also
be
unconstitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
farr,
what
does
it
do
to
your
argument
that
many
cable
companies
have,
say,
only
30-odd
channels
now,
and
one
of
the
reasons
you
say
you
don't
want
to
be
forced
to
carry
is
that
you
then
have
to
give
up
something.
now,
i
can
understand
your
point
about
the
favored
position
that
you're
required
to
give
to
broadcasters,
but
if
there's
not
going
to
be
any
limit
on
the
number
of
channels
that
you
can
have,
doesn't
that
dilute
your
objection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
days,
there's
one
point
i
wasn't
clear
on
in
your
presentations
in
your
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying,
based
on
your
argument
that
minimal
scrutiny
should
apply
here,
that
there
really
is
no
difference
in
the
authority
of
the
government
vis-a-vis
cable
and,
on
the
other
hand,
radio
broadcasting,
radio
and
television
broadcasters?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
could
the
government,
if
it
wished,
have
a
fairness
doctrine,
have
an
equal
time
doctrine,
have
a
decent
speech
regulation
with
respect
to
cable
operators
and
programmers
as
it
does
for
radio
and
television
broadcasting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
conceded
that
there
are
more
restrictions
on
what
the
legislature
could
do
vis-a-vis
the
cable...
the
content
of
what
cable
operators
could
choose
to
put
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
all
prediction,
because
it
hadn't
happened.
when
the
d.c.
circuit
dealt
with
the
fcc
regulations,
and
so
must-carry
was
out,
there
wasn't
a
huge
change,
was
there,
so
these
findings...
what
you
refer
to,
findings,
are
more
in
the
nature
of
predictions,
well,
they're
not
so
bad
now,
but
they're
going
to
get
worse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
incentive,
but
the
experience...
mr.
farr
gave
some
figures
about
how
little
had
in
fact
been
dropped,
and
you're
not
disputing
the
accuracy
of
his
figures?
you
point
out
that
yes,
there
are
some
stations
that
have
been
dropped.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
an
impressive
record
of
what's
been
dropped
so
far.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
even
though
there
was
no
clear
and
present
danger
of
anything
like
that
from
the
signals
that
had
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
days--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before
you
conclude,
can
you
focus
attention
on
the
programmer,
not
the
operator.
the
programmer's
argument,
i
take
it,
is
why
am
i
being
disfavored?
