h.

but
does
that
sort
of
define
the
problem
in
a
way
that
makes
it
easier
for
you?
why
is
it
illegitimate
to
look
at
the
operating
companies
simply
as
carriers
as
opposed
to
originators,
and
say
that
in
one
respect,
i.e.
their
respect
as
carriers,
they
are
subject
to
obligations
the
way
the
phone
company
might
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
the
significance
of
that,
in
a
way,
is
easy
if
we
use
the
terms
like
editorial
discretion,
which
have
taken
on
a
meaning
from
the
newspaper
context,
but
this
doesn't
quite
fit
the
newspaper
context.
i
suppose
the
position
that
the
carrier
is
in
here,
the
operating
company
is
in
here,
is
somewhere
in
between
that
of
the
newspaper
and
the
telephone
company,
and
how
should
we
decide
whether
the
significance
of
a
limitation
on
editorial
discretion
should
be
analyzed
as
if
it
were
a
newspaper,
or
on
the
other
hand
as
if
we
were
looking
at
it
as
an
analogue
to
the
phone
company?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
explain
one
thing
to
me,
because
i
think
it
was
the
nub
of
the
answer
that
you
just
gave,
and
that
is,
judge
williams
relied
very
heavily
in
his
opinion
on
the
fact
that
the
fcc
requires
certain
elements
of
content
in
local
programming,
and
therefore
a
fortiori
it
is
required
by
must-carry.
would
your
argument
then
equate
must-carry
with
least
access
if
the
government
stopped
regulating...
through
the
fcc
stopped
regulating
the
content
of
local
programming?
would
they
then
be
on
par?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
deal
with
programming
on
all
broadcast
stations,
so
that
your
identification
of
the
speaker
would
be
purely
geographic
at
that
point,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
i.e.,
locally.
the
only
way
you
would
identify
them
would
be
their
point
of
origin
rather
than
anything
to
do
with
their
content,
let
alone
their
prescribed
content.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
distinguish...
i
guess
this
is
my
point
of
ignorance.
that
would
distinguish
between
cable
and
broadcast,
the
cable
operators
could
be
indecent?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
we
agree
with
you,
congress
goes
back,
drops
all
the
findings
about
content
and
the
value
of
local
origination,
and
simply
sticks
to
findings
about
the
threat
to
competition?
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
just
says,
look,
we
want
to
lock
the
door
before
the
horse
has
gone.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
congress
responded...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
point
of
justice
o'connor's
question
is,
congress
responded
by
explaining
why
the
content
of
local
programming
and
educational
television
programming
was
more
desirable,
or
was
in
itself
desirable.
they
were
putting
a
content
justification
on
it,
and
i
don't
know
how
you
get
over
that
hurdle
except
perhaps
by
saying,
look,
the
motives
were
mixed,
or
on
the
other
hand
we
have
a
justification
that
will
avail
us
even
though
there
is
a
content
basis,
but
it's
still
the
case
that
they
have
made
the
decision
and
have
explained
the
decision
on
a
content
basis,
haven't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
whenever--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
whenever
you
get
a
particular
content
which
is
not
otherwise
being
broadcast,
your
justification
is
always
diversity.
if
we
don't
require
it,
or
push
someone
else
aside
to
allow
it
in,
we
will
not
have
diversity
to
that
extent.
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
a
diversity
argument
and
a
content
argument
here,
and
in
any
event
i
don't
see
how
you
could
make
that
distinction
so
long
as
the
government
through
the
fcc
does
regulate
the
content
to
some
degree
of
the
broadcast
medium.
