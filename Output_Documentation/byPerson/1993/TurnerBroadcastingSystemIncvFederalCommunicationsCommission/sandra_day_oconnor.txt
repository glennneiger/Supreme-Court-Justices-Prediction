well,
mr.
farr,
there
is...
we
have
a
situation
where
one
medium
has
a
limited
number
of
channels,
and
does
the
government
have
no
interest
at
all
in
seeing
that
those
channels
are
opened
up--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
others
on
a
neutral
basis,
for
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
instance,
the
dissenting
judge
on
the
panel
below
suggested
an
alternative
way
that
the
government
might
proceed.
would
you
like
to
comment
on
that
suggestion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
farr,
to
what
extent
is
the
scarcity
rationale
undercut
by
current
technology?
i
guess
we
have
now
coming
on
line
satellite
services
that
will
provide
hundreds
of
channels
with
a
tiny
dish--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--available
so
there
would
be
no
scarcity.
we
have
fiberoptics
coming
on
line,
and
they
have
virtually
unlimited
capacity.
does
this
undercut
the
scarcity
rationale,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
mr.
days--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
acknowledge
that
to
be
valid
the
congressional
regulation
has
to
be
content-neutral?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--wait
a
minute.
maybe
i
didn't
express
myself
clearly
enough.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
acknowledge
the
legal
principle
that
to
be
valid
it
must
be
content-neutral?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
was
just
trying
to
ascertain
whether
you
take
the
position
or
acknowledge
that
it
must
be
content-neutral
to
survive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
difficult
argument
to
make
in
light
of
the
findings
that
place
such
stress
on
the
desirability
of
public
television
and
local
broadcasting
and
discussing
local
issues
and
so
forth.
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
sustain
that
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
congress
went
ahead
on
that
basis,
then,
and
set
aside
a
third
of
a
whole
medium
for
the
benefit
of
a
favored
class
of
speakers,
so
it's
a
little
difficult
to
justify
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
existing
doctrine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
more
currently,
does
the
record
reflect
any
findings
to
the
anticipated
effect
of
this
new
satellite
service
that
will
go
on
line
within
a
year
that
will
make
virtually
unlimited
access
to
people?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
more
like
the
telephone
industry.
the
capacity
will
be
virtually
unlimited,
and
congress
on
a
content-neutral
basis
can
say,
okay,
serve
everybody.
i
mean,
that's
a
very
different
proposition
than
what
you
have
here,
isn't
it?
