mr.
farr,
if
a
municipality
is
reviewing
bids
for
a
cable
company,
and
let's
assume
economically
there
can
probably
be
only
one
cable
company,
i
take
it
it's
entitled
to
assess
the
cultural
offerings
of
the
different
programs
from
the
different
bidders?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
based
on
what
we've
said
so
far,
i
assume
that
the
must-carry
provision
for
public
broadcasting
is
the
most
vulnerable
based
on
the
content
argument,
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
it's
the
most
vulnerable,
and
if
we
assume
also
for
the
moment...
there
can
be
a
debate
about
it,
but
if
you
assume
that
that's
the
most
justifiable
provision
from
the
standpoint
of
improving
our
young
people's
intellectual
life,
does
that
mean
there's
something
wrong
with
our
doctrine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
public
broadcast
must-carry
provision,
that
that's
not
content-based?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
our
doctrine
puts
you
in
the
position
of
trying
to
minimize
the
content-based
aspect
of
the
decision,
which
might
really
be
its
best
justification
from
a
cultural
standpoint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
present
day
context,
if
the
networks
are
being
carried,
the
network
affiliates,
then
what
we're
talking
about
is
replacing
marginally
successful
broadcast
stations
against
marginally
successful
cable
offerings.
is
that
all
this
is
about?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
comes
to
us
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
so-called
must
carry
rules
enacted
as
part
of
the
cable
television
consumer
protection
and
competition
act
of
1992.
the
must
carry
rules
require
cable
television
system
operators
to
set
aside
approximately
one
third
of
their
available
channels
for
the
transmission
of
local
broadcast
television
stations.
as
explained
in
findings
enacted
into
the
cable
act
itself,
congress
determined
that
these
rules
are
necessary
to
protect
the
viability
of
broadcast
television
against
the
increasing
competitive
threats
posed
by
cable.
the
appellants
in
the
case
are
numerous
cable
operators
and
cable
programers.
the
cable
operators
are
those
who
owned
a
physical
cable
network
and
transmit
the
cable
signals
to
the
subscriber's
television
sets.
cable
programers
are
those
who
produce
television
programs
that
are
aired
over
cable
systems
such
as
cnn,
c-span,
espn,
and
mtv.
on
the
day
the
cable
act
went
into
effect,
appellants
brought
the
suit
alleging
that
the
must
carry
rules
violates
the
first
amendment
rights
of
both
cable
operators
and
cable
programers.
the
district
court
decided
the
case
on
summary
judgment.
it
rejected
appellant's
challenge
and
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
must
carry
rules.
in
petition,
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
must
carry
rules
should
be
analyzed
under
the
intermediate
standard
of
scrutiny
reserved
for
content-neutral
regulations
of
speech
and
that
the
rule
satisfied
the
scrutiny
because
they
are
narrowly-tailored
to
serve
the
important
government
interest
in
the
preservation
of
local
television
broadcasting.
as
an
initial
matter,
we
reject
the
united
states
argument
that
regulation
of
cable
television
should
be
analyzed
under
the
less
rigorous
standard
of
first
amendment
review,
and
we
have
applied
to
broadcast
regulation
as
exemplified
by
the
red
lion
broadcasting
case.
instead,
we
must
analyze
the
must
carry
rules
under
settled
principles
of
our
first
amendment
jurisprudence,
and
because
the
must
carry
provisions
do
impose
special
obligations
upon
cable
operators
and
special
burdens
upon
cable
programers
some
measure
of
heightened
first
amendment
scrutiny
is
demanded.
however,
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
the
must
carry
rule
should
be
analyzed
under
the
test
reserve
for
content-neutral
regulations,
we
nevertheless
conclude
that
it
was
error
for
the
district
court
to
decide
on
summary
judgment.
and
in
light
of
material
facts
and
dispute
on
this
record
that
the
must
carry
rules
will
advance
a
substantial
government
interest
and
a
manner
that
it
does
not
burden
substantially
more
speech
than
necessary.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
therefore
vacate
and
remand
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
we
do
reject
appellant's
arguments,
however,
that
the
must
carry
rules
are
content-based
and
must
therefore
be
presumed
invalid.
the
provisions
are
content-neutral
and
not
only
in
their
face
but
also
in
their
operation
and
overwriting
purpose.
the
rules
benefit
also
para-broadcasters
who
request
carriage
on
cable
systems
they
are
respective
with
the
nature
of
their
programming,
and
the
rules
burden
all
but
the
smallest
cable
systems
nationwide
regardless
of
the
content
of
the
programming
they
offer.
the
purposes
of
underlying
must
carry
rules
are
also
unrelated
to
content.
our
review
of
the
act
and
its
various
findings
persuade
us
that
congress'
overwriting
objectives
in
enacting
must
carry
was
not
to
favor
programing
of
a
particular
subject
matter
viewpoint
or
format,
but
rather
to
preserve
access
to
free
television
programing
for
the
40%
of
americans
without
cable.
by
preventing
cable
operators
from
refusing
carriage
to
broadcast
television
stations,
the
must
carry
rules
are
meant
to
ensure
that
broadcast
television
stations
will
retain
a
large
enough
potential
audience
to
earn
necessary
advertising
revenue
or
in
the
case
of
non-commercial
broadcasters
sufficient
viewer
contributions
to
maintain
their
continued
operation.
in
so
doing,
the
provisions
are
designed
to
guarantee
the
survival
of
a
medium
that
has
become
a
vital
part
of
the
nation's
communication
system
and
to
ensure
that
ever
individual
with
a
television
set
can
obtain
access
to
free
television
programing.
this
overwriting
congressional
purpose
is
unrelated
to
the
content
of
expression
disseminated
by
cable
and
broadcast
speakers.
the
must
carry
rules
do
not
amount
to
an
impermissible
intrusion
on
cable
operator's
editorial
autonomy.
the
first
amendment's
command
that
government
not
impede
the
freedom
of
speech
does
not
disable
the
government
from
taking
step
to
ensure
that
private
interests
do
not
restrict
through
physical
control
of
the
critical
pathway
of
communication
the
free
flow
of
information
and
ideas.
and
unlike
the
speaker
access
rules,
we
have
strucked
down
in
prior
cases
the
must
carry
rules
are
not
activated
by
any
particular
message
spoken
by
cable
operators
and
they
do
not
force
cable
operators
to
alter
their
own
messages
to
respond
to
the
broadcast
programing
they
are
required
to
carry.
in
sum,
we
conclude
that
the
must
carry
provisions
do
no
pose
such
inherent
dangers
to
free
expression
or
present
such
potential
for
censorship
or
manipulation
as
to
justify
application
of
the
most
exacting
level
of
first
amendment
scrutiny
rather
the
appropriate
standard
by
which
to
evaluate
the
constitutionality
of
must
carry
is
the
intermediate
level
of
scrutiny
applicable
to
the
content-neutral
restrictions
on
speech.
to
satisfy
this
standard,
a
regulation
must
further
an
important
or
substantial
government
interest
and
relate
it
to
the
suppression
of
free
speech
and
the
means
chosen
for
doing
so
must
not
be
written
in
more
speech
than
is
necessary
to
further
the
government's
interest.
the
government
asserts
that
the
must
carry
rules
were
designed
to
promote
three
interests:
to
preserve
the
benefits
of
free
broadcast
television,
to
promote
the
wide
spread
dissemination
of
information
from
a
multiplicity
of
sources,
and
to
promote
fair
competition
in
the
market
for
television
programing
viewed
in
the
abstract.
we
have
no
difficulty
concluding
that
each
of
these
governmental
interest
is
important,
that
the
asserted
interest
are
important
in
the
abstract
does
not
mean,
however
that
the
must
carry
provisions
will
in
fact
advance
those
interests.
when
the
government
defends
a
regulation
on
speech
as
a
remedy
for
past
or
anticipated
harms,
the
government
must
demonstrate
that
the
recited
harms
are
real,
not
merely
conjectural
and
that
the
regulation
will
in
fact
alleviate
these
harms
without
burdening
substantially
more
speech
than
necessary
to
do
so.
because
there
is
insufficient
evidence
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
broadcast
television
is
in
genuine
jeopardy
and
because
there
remain
unresolved
issues
of
material
fact
considering
the
extent
to
which
the
must
carry
rules
will
curtail
the
speech
of
cable
programers
in
the
availability
of
less
speech
restrictive
means
to
accomplish
the
government's
asserted
interest,
we
hold
that
the
district
court
erred
in
granting
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
because
of
the
end
result
facial
questions,
the
important
of
the
issues
the
broadcast
and
cable
industries
and
the
conflicting
conclusions
of
the
parties
contended
to
be
drawn
from
the
statistics
and
other
evidence
presented,
we
think
it
necessary
to
permit
the
parties
to
develop
a
more
thorough
factual
record
and
to
allow
the
district
court
to
resolve
any
factual
disputes
remaining
before
passing
upon
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
challenged
provisions.
the
judgment
below
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
he
expresses
substantial
agreement
with
the
court's
analysis
and,
though,
favoring
the
affirmance
concurs
in
the
judgment
so
that
there
will
be
a
majority
for
the
disposition
of
the
case.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
scalia
and
ginsburg
joined
and
in
which
justice
thomas
joins
in
part,
and
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
