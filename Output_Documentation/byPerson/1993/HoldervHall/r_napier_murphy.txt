mr.
r.
napier
murphy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
claim
that
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
requires
bleckley
county,
georgia,
to
enlarge
its
current,
single-member
county
commission
to
a
five-person
commission.
our
position
is
that
the
act
cannot
be
read
as
authorizing
federal
courts
to
alter
the
size
of
governing
bodies.
instead,
the
existing
structure
of
state
and
local
governments,
the
number,
and
types
of
offices,
must
be
taken
as
a
given,
a
basic
assumption.
thus,
while
the
method
of
election
may
be
a
cognizable
claim,
changing
the
size
of
a
government
to
prove
a
voting
rights
violation
is
not.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
your
honor,
our
position
is
not
that
section
2
doesn't
cover
a
claim.
our
argument
is
that
section
2
cannot
be
read
as
authorizing
federal
courts
to
change
the
size
of
the
government.
the
courts
must
look
at
the
existing
structure
when
analyzing
a
section
2
claim.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
there
would
be
a
remedy
under
section
5.
that
change--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--if
there
were
a
lawsuit
seeking
to
change
the
size
of
the
government
from
five--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--if
there
was
an
intentional
reason
to
dilute
minority
voting
strength
because
of
the
reduction,
yes,
there
would
be
a
violation.
it
would
in
my
opinion
be
a
section
5
claim
instead--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--of
a
section
2
claim.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
if
there
has
been
a
retrogression
of
minority
voting
strength
and
minority
votes
are
diluted
by
virtue
of
that
change
by
county
government,
then
there
would
be
a
section
2
claim,
but
the
county--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--no,
sir.
the
county
has
not
tried
to
change
the
size
of
the
local
governing
body
here.
there
has
been
a
group
of
private
plaintiffs
who
have
filed
a
lawsuit
seeking
to
change
the
size
of
the
local
governing
body.
our
position
is
that
the
intent
of
congress
in
writing
section
2
was
not
to
guarantee
election
to
office,
not
to
guarantee
proportional
representation,
but
simply
to
question
whether
the
existing
size,
or
the
existing
system
dilutes
minority--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--your
honor,
section
2
has
not...
section
2
addresses
the
method
of
electing
persons
to
office.
if
there
were
a
change
by
the
government
from
five
to
three,
and
it
could
be
proven
that
there
was
a
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength
as
a
result
of
that,
then
there
would
be
a
claim
under
section
2.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
that
is
because
the
governing
body
has
made
a
change
in
the
size.
in
our
case,
the
governing
body
has
made
no
change
in
the
size.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
no,
sir,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
don't
think
an
act
of
omission
is
the
same
as
an
act
of
commission.
there
was
one
case
from
carroll
county,
georgia,
in
which
there
was
a
change
in
the
size
of
the
county
commission
from
three
to
one,
and
in
that
case
the
plaintiffs
were
able
to
prove
an
intent
to
discriminate
and
to
dilute
minority
voting
strength
as
a
result
of
that.
that
is
not
the
situation
in
our
case.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
under
the
preconditions
set
forth
by
this
court
in
gingles,
in
order
to
bring
a
vote
dilution
claim,
you
must
meet
three
preconditions.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
there
can
be
a
change...
there
can
be
a
challenge,
regardless
of
whether
there
has
been
a
change
or
not.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
our
position
in
this
case--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--well,
in
the
district
before
us
we're
talking
about
a
single-member
district--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--which
is
the
smallest
political
unit
from
which
any
elected
person
can--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--there's
nothing
magical
about
this
being
a
single-member
district.
the
question
is--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--no,
sir.
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
intended,
under
section
2,
to
authorize
federal
courts
to
judge
the
governmental
structure
not
as
it
presently
is
constituted,
but
as
it
might
be
in
a
hypothetical
model,
and
if
we
have
three,
or
five,
or
seven,
or
one,
it
doesn't
matter
how
many
members
you
are
electing
to
office,
minority
members
could
always
come
in
and
say,
in
our
five-member
commission
we
are
in
a
minority,
we
can't
get
elected,
but
if
you
increase
the
commission
to
10,
then
we
have
a
chance
to
have
proportional
representation.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
our
position
is,
the
court,
when
it
is
analyzing
a
section
2
claim,
must
analyze
the
claim
according
to
the
existing
governmental
structure.
it
presupposes--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--exactly,
your
honor.
in
order
to--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--because
the
statute...
when
you
talk
about
changing
government
structure,
you're
talking
about
local
voters
voting
to
change
the
way
their
county
is
operated,
whether
it
be
by
one,
three,
five,
and
in
the
cases
thus
far,
there
have
been
changes
in
the
size
of
the
local
governing
body,
and
the
courts
have
looked
to
see
whether
there
was
an
attempt
to
discriminate
because
of
the
change
in
the
local
governing
body.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
in
the--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--your
honor--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--houston
lawyers
i
do
not
believe
involved
a
challenge
to
any
district
that
had
only
one
judge.
i
believe
all
of
the
judges
in
houston
lawyers
were
from
multimember
districts,
so
to
speak.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
some
of
those
counties...
all
of
those
counties
had
more
than
one
judge.
there
were
three--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--3
up
to
59,
and--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--that's
correct.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
the
distinction
here
is
not
that
a
sole
commissioner
form
of
government
is
not
subject
to
section
2.
our
argument
here
is
that
a
section...
that
the
sole
commissioner
form
of
government
does
not
dilute
minority
voting
strength.
everyone
in
this
county
votes
for
one
representative
for
the
entire
political
jurisdiction.
every
person's
vote
counts
equally.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
our
case--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--would
you
repeat
the
question,
your
honor?
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
in
that
kind
of
case,
you
would
have
a
section
5
preclearance--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--if
the
method
of
electing
judges
violates
or
dilutes...
or
electing
any
representative,
dilutes
minority
voting
strength,
then
you
do
have
a
claim--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--my
reasoning...
my
argument
here
is
that
when
you
analyze
a
section
2
claim,
you
don't
look
to...
you
look
at
the
existing
structure.
you
cannot
look
at
what
might
be.
you
cannot
look--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--your
honor,
the
reason
we
don't
do
that
here,
number
1,
in
this
case
we
are
looking
at
a
single-member
district
itself,
which
is
the
basic
political
unit.
we're
not
looking
at
a
multimember
structure
here.
we're
looking
at
a
single-member
district.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
if
minority
voting
strength
is
diluted.
by
the
same--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--because
i
think
we're
talking
about
two
separate
events
here.
simply
because
you
might
be
prevented
from
going
from
five
to
one
doesn't
mean
that
if
you
already
have
one
in
place,
the
court
can
require
you
to
go
to
five.
the
proviso
in
section
2
is
that
it
is
not
designed
to
ensure
proportional
representation.
if
you
have
25,
and
you
reduce
to
5,
and
you
dilute
minority
voting
strength,
that
would
be
a
section
5
violation.
that
doesn't
mean,
on
the
other
hand,
that
you...
the
court
can
take
5
and
require
a
county
to
go
to
25
in
order
to
assure
an
asian
district,
a
hispanic
district,
or
a
black
district,
simply
because--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--i
believe
it's
14.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
i
think
from
the
time
we
filed
the
petition
until
today,
five
have
changed,
either
by
settlement
of
voting
rights
litigation
or
by
county
election
to
change.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
your
honor,
that
hypothetical
question
probably
would
go
more
toward
a
constitutional
claim
than
it
would
a
section
2
claim.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
address
difficulty
to
elect.
it
addresses
an
equal
opportunity--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--if
you
can
prove
that
during
the
time
that
this
sole
commissioner--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--yes,
but
that
is
not
our
argument
here.
our
argument
is
that
you--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--by
virtue
of
the
method
of
electing.
i'm
not
saying
that
simply
because
you
have
a
sole
commissioner
you
are
violating
section
2.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
your
honor--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--if
you
also
prove
the
three
gingles
factors.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
which
is
my
argument
exactly,
in
this--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--it
is
impossible--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--simply
because
it
exists--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--it
is
not
diluted.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
yes,
sir,
that
is
our
position.
having
one
person
elected
from
one
jurisdiction
would
not
violate
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
yes.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
i
have
changed
my
answer,
yes.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
the
change
could
be
a
violation.
simply
having
a
one-member
district
is
not
a
violation,
but
i
agree
that
changing,
if
you
have
intent,
could
be
a
violation.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
i
think--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--okay,
because
in
our
case
there
has
not
been
a
change,
number
1,
and
number
2--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--well,
gingles...
gingles'
three
preconditions
require
that
you
have
compactness
and
numerosity
in
a
single-member
district,
that
you
have
political
cohesion,
and
racial
polarization--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--both.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
you
cannot
satisfy
that
in
an
existing
single-member
district.
all
you--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--well,
the
difference
is
because
you
have
made
a
change.
you
have
made
a
change.
simply
because
there
might
be
a
violation
because
of
a
change--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--if
you
have
one
person...
i
agree
with
you,
judge,
if
you
are
looking
at
either
a
new
or
an--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--no,
sir,
because
i'm
looking
at
this
as
an
intent
to
discriminate
when
you
make
a
change.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
that's
correct.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
courts
should
take
an
existing
single-member
district
or
a
commission
of
three
or
a
commission
of
five
and
judge
that
by
an
assumed
model,
which
is
what
the
eleventh
circuit
has
done
here.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
there
are
no
workable
standards
if...
regardless
of
whether
you
have
one
or
three
or
five,
if
courts
start
coming
in
and
trying
to
determine
a
vote
dilution
not
by
the
existing
model
but
by
some
assumed
commission
of--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--the
sole
county
commissioner
form
in
georgia
is
the
third
most
popular
form
in
georgia.
it's
true
that
five
is
the
most
common
form,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
the
only
form
or
the--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--well,
assume
that
we
have
a
commission
of
10
members,
should
the...
and
that's
the
situation
in
clarke
county,
georgia.
should
we
be
required
to
go
up
to
25
in
order
to
assure
a
certain
number--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--your
honor,
i
disagree
that
that
is
a
benchmark
in
georgia.
there
are
counties
with
all
different
sizes.
it's
a
question
of
local
and
state
interest
in
determining
the
size,
because
every
county
is
different.
they
have
different
geographies,
different
ideologies,
different
needs,
and
simply
because
most
counties
have
five
doesn't
mean
that
the
citizens
in
one
county
or
another
must
have
five
or
must
have
three
simply
because
that's
the
most
popular
form.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
five
plus
one
at
large.
it
was
a
referendum.
the
general
assembly
passed
legislation
authorizing
a
referendum
to
go
to
a
six-member
commission,
five
from
districts
and
one
at
large.
there
was
very
little
interest
in
the
black
community
in
that
referendum.
it
was
a
tax
issue.
there
had
been
an
ad
valorem
tax
change
in
the
county
by
the
commissioner,
voters
were
unhappy
with
it,
the
referendum
was
held
whether
to
change
the
commission,
and
the
voters
in
the
county,
only
25
percent
of
whom
voted,
voted
in
favor
of
keeping
their
sole
commissioner.
in
school
board
district
number
2,
which
is
the
majority
black
school
board
district,
the
measure
passed
by
only
2
votes,
and
there
was
very
little
organized
interest
in
the
black
community
at
all
in
that
referendum.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
no,
your
honor.
four
years
earlier,
the
county
had
decided
to
go
to
five
single-member
districts
for
the
school
board,
so
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
the
county
is
racist
or
polarized.
the
county
voters
decided
they
preferred
five
single-member
districts
for
the
school
board.
as
far
as
their
county
governing
authority
is
concerned,
one
is
what
the
citizens
there
prefer.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
the
county
commissioner
is
paid
by
taxpayers.
he
has
regular
office
hours
in
the
bleckley
county
courthouse,
he
conducts
regular
monthly
meetings,
if
he
has
to
make
a
policy
decision
he
advertises
it
in
the
local
newspaper,
he
makes
$32,500
a
year,
and
it's--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--yes.
that
is
the
reason...
that
is
the
primary
reason
local
voters
like
what
they
have.
if
you
need
your
roads
scraped,
if
you
need
anything
that
the
county
commissioner
has
authority
to
do,
you
walk
into
his
office,
and
you
talk
to
him
about
it.
it
is
a
very
efficient,
economical,
workable
system,
and
he's
immediately
responsive
to
the
voters.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
yes.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
they
would
be,
yes.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
yes.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
if
they
were
only
part-time,
which
i
assume
they
would
be,
then
they
would
make
less
money,
but
then
the
county
would
be
required
to
hire
a
county
administrator
to
manage
the
day-to-day
functions
of
the
office.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
it
might
be
met,
your
honor,
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
here
is
that
the
single
county
commissioner
is
what
the
government...
the
local
citizens
in
that
body
desired.
simply
because
there's
one
person
to
fill
that
office
doesn't
make
it
magical.
the
question
here
is
whether,
under
the
gingles
test,
the
court
has
the
authority
or
should
take
on
the
responsibility--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--i
would
take
the
same
position
that
the
existing
single-member
form
of
government
in
bleckley
county--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--is
not
subject
to
challenge
as
dilutive--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--of
minority
voting
strength,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
have
a
county
of
10,000
people.
70
percent
of
the
registered
voters,
black
and
white,
are
registered.
voter
registration
is
equal
for
both
blacks
and
whites.
they
vote
equally
in
all
elections,
the
same
percentages...
29
to
30
to
31
percent.
it's
the
same.
they
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate
in
that
county,
whether
they
are
voting
for
one
sole
commissioner,
one
sheriff,
or
one
school
board
district
member.
we're
not
talking
about
benchmarking
in
order
to
prove
a
section
2
claim.
we're
talking
about
bootstrapping.
in
these
other
counties
that
went
from
one
to
three...
one
to
three...
why
didn't
they
go
one
to
five?
because
three
guaranteed
proportional
representation.
if
five
is
the
benchmark,
these
other
sole
commissioner
counties
that
have
decided
to
change
should
have
gone
to
five.
if
we're
talking
about
benchmarking,
should
the
texas
legislature,
which
has
only
31
members,
be
expanded
to
meet
the
modal
size
of
state
legislatures
in
this
country?
there
are
no
workable
limits
if
we
start
changing
or
expanding
the
size
of
government
to
determine
a
vote
dilution
claim.
you
look
at
the
existing
number
of
seats.
this
court
refused,
in
the
beens
case
referred
to
by
mr.
coates,
to
order
a
reduction
of
50
percent
in
the
state
senate
of
minnesota
and
25
percent
in
the
house
of
representatives.
this
court
refused
that
change
even
for
a
constitutional
violation.
we
are
talking
about
a
500-percent
change
in
the
size
of
the
governing
body
for
this
small
county.
that
is
not
a
minor
change.
mr.
coates
also
referred
to
sheriffs
as
having
executive
authority,
but
sheriffs
make
many
decisions
which
affect
minorities.
hiring
minority
deputies,
enforcing
the
laws
as
to
minorities,
providing
patrols
for
minority
neighborhoods...
all
of
those
actions
affect
minority
voters.
you
cannot--
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
--adequate
proof
of
political
cohesion
would
be
proof
that
minorities
get
together
to
sponsor
candidates,
that
they
run
a
candidate.
no
minority
has
ever
run
for
any
county-wide
office
in
the
81-year
history
with
the
exception
of
one
election
for
a
probate
judge
in
1984,
but
as
long
as
no
minority
runs
for
office
in
that
county,
then
it's
certain
that
no
minority
will
win
election.
mr.
r.
napier
murphy
thank
you
very
much.
