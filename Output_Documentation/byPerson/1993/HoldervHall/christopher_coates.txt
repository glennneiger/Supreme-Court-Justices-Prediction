mr.
christopher
coates
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court
judge,
after
he
heard
all
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
announced
from
the
bench
that
having
run
for
public
office
himself,
i
guarantee
you
under
these
circumstances
i
wouldn't
run
if
i
were
black
in
bleckley
county.
you're
going
to
put
your
hard-earned
time
and
shoe
leather
campaigning
through
this
county
under
these
circumstances.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
voting
in
bleckley
county
is
along
racial
lines.
at
present,
the
only
polling
place
in
this
county,
which
consists
of
219
square
miles,
is
an
all-white
private
club.
between
1978
and
1986,
224
persons
were
appointed
to
serve
as
poll
managers
in
bleckley
county,
and
not
one
of
the
224
appointees
were
black
persons.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
coates
no,
sir.
mr.
christopher
coates
no,
sir,
because
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
traditionally
been
a
true
single-member
office
in
this
country.
he's
a
member
of
the
executive
branch.
there
must
be
one
decisionmaker
as
president
of
the
united
states.
the
governing
body
that
we're
talking
about
here
today
is
a
body,
the
bleckley
county
commission,
that
carries
out
legislative
functions
as
well
as
executive
functions.
mr.
christopher
coates
no,
sir,
because
i
think,
again,
the
governorship
of
the
state
is
a
true,
single-member
office.
mr.
christopher
coates
well,
the
courts--
mr.
christopher
coates
--well,
section
2--
mr.
christopher
coates
--no,
sir.
section
2
has
both
an
intent
and
result
component.
mr.
christopher
coates
section
2
has
been
construed
to
prohibit
racially
motivated
voting
procedures,
which
would
be
the
same
as
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
christopher
coates
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
it
has
a
double
standard.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir.
i
think
that...
your
honor,
the
response
to
that
question
would
be
that
one
would
have
to
look
at
what
the
congress
was
intending
to
prohibit
or
to
address
enacting
section
2
in
1982,
and
if
you
look--
mr.
christopher
coates
--my
position--
mr.
christopher
coates
--no,
i
do
not.
i
do
not
think
if
it's
a
true
single-member
office
that
carries
out
legislative
functions...
it
carries
out
executive
functions
and
not
legislative
functions,
that
i
think
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
reach
those
offices.
mr.
christopher
coates
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
the
principal
problem
that
the
congress
was
addressing
in
enacting
the
voting
rights
act
was
the
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength
at
the
legislative
body
process,
and
i
think
that
that's
the
distinction
that
should
be
drawn
here
with
regards
to
true
single-member
offices
and
legislative
offices--
mr.
christopher
coates
--it
does...
there
was
not
an
intent
by
congress
in
enacting
the
statute
to
increase...
to
allow
section
2
plaintiffs
to
increase
the
number
of
true...
true
single-member
offices.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
coates
the
bleckley
county
commission--
mr.
christopher
coates
--is
both...
has
all
the
legislative
powers
of
the
governing
authority
in
bleckley
county
as
well
as
the
executive
powers,
but
a
test
can--
mr.
christopher
coates
--they...
my
understanding
would
be
that
they
would
be
executive
agencies.
mr.
christopher
coates
but
they
would
not
be
legislative
bodies.
mr.
christopher
coates
because
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
govern
in
the
sense
of
passing
ordinances
that
a
local--
mr.
christopher
coates
--yes,
sir.
well,
in
the
traditional
sense,
they
do
not
have
the
authority
to
legislatively
enact
laws
or
ordinances
that
a
county
commissioner
or
a
city
council
or
a
general
assembly
of
a
state
would.
mr.
christopher
coates
that's
another
distinction,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir.
well,
your
benchmark
goes
to
the
question
that
was
raised
by
the
county
here
concerning
how
and
to
what
limit
there
would
be
a
limitation
on
the
expansion
of
representatives
on
the
local
government
body.
mr.
christopher
coates
i
think
the
benchmark
test
would
go
to
that
question,
and
you
would
look
to
tradition
in
this
country
of
having
a
distinction
between
legislative
offices,
which
are
normally
multimember
boards,
and
executive
offices,
which
are
normally
true,
single-member
offices.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir.
well,
in
response
to
the
question
by
justice
scalia,
i
was
responding
in
that
manner,
but
the
benchmark
that...
that--
mr.
christopher
coates
--not
for
this
particular
case,
but
in
response
to
his
question
i
was
answering
it
in
that
way.
mr.
christopher
coates
no,
sir.
i
think
that
the
first
place
you
would
look
to
a
benchmark
would
be
to
the
state,
because
that
would
determine
the
state's
policy.
mr.
christopher
coates
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case,
because
if
georgia
had
a
statute
that
provided
that
every
county
would
have
a
sole
commissioner,
then
there
would
be
a
strong
argument
in
this
case
that
the
state
policy
required
the
sole-commissioner
form
of
government,
but
i
thought--
mr.
christopher
coates
--it
would
not
be...
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case.
whether
or
not
some
counsel
could
construct
an
argument
that
would
say
that
you
could
look
to
oregon,
i
just
don't
know,
but
in
this
case
159
counties
exist
in
georgia.
only...
my
count's
a
little
bit
different...
11
counties
have
the
sole
commissioner
form.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir.
there
are
only
11
counties
in
georgia
that
have
a
sole
commissioner
form
of
government.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
ma'am,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
christopher
coates
well,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
analysis
applied
to
the
issue
of
racial
bloc
voting
by
the
district
court
judge
was
too
narrow.
the
district
court
held
that
in
making
that
analysis,
or
determination,
that
he
was
limited
to
statistical
analysis
in
determining
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
racial
bloc
voting.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
you
could
look
to
other,
antidotal
evidence
in
the
case
that
addressed
the
issue
of
racial
polarization,
such
as
the
fact
that
when
black
people
go
to
vote
in
bleckley
county,
that
there
would
be
in
an
8-year
period
224
black...
white
managers
and
no
black
managers,
for
example.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
one
could
look
at--
mr.
christopher
coates
--that's
correct,
because
in
1986,
the
eight
existing
precincts
that
existed
in
1984
had
been
consolidated
into
one
precinct,
and
under
a
one-precinct
situation
regression
analysis
is
not
possible
because
you
need
at
least
two
or
more
precincts
to
compare
to
do
the
regression
analysis,
so
it
was
not
a
possibility
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
to
offer
a
statistical
showing
concerning
the
1986
referendum.
but
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
to
footnote
25
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
gingles
case
and
read
that
footnote
to
say
that
the
district
court
was
incorrect
in
ruling
that
you
looked
at
only
statistical
evidence,
and
allowed
a
broader
look,
and
on
that
basis
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
district
court
had
erred.
what
is
the
broader
look,
other
than
that
when
you
have
a
unit
that
has
a
majority
population
and
a
minority
population,
the
chances
are
that
you
will
have
a
representative
from
the
majority
group?
the
broader
look
was
the
continuing
racial
segregation
and
polarization
within
the
county
which
created
an
impediment
for
black
candidates
to
solicit
white
voters,
or
for
black
voters
to
form
coalitions
with
white
voters,
and
that
continuing
polarization
was
evidence
sufficient
in
addition
to
the
statistical
evidence
that
the
plaintiffs
offered
to
satisfy
the
racial
polarization
requirement
in
gingles.
the
court--
mr.
christopher
coates
--no,
sir.
first
of
all,
our
position
is
that
the
increase
in
the
number
of
representatives
on
the
governing
authority
would
first
be
determined
by
looking
at
the
state
law
benchmark,
and
the
state
law
benchmark
in
this
case
i
believe
is
5,
it
would
not
be
10.
secondarily,
this
court
held
in
1972,
in
the
beens
case...
i
think
it's
sixty-seventh
minnesota
v.
beens...
that
minor
deviations
are
allowed
from
the
state
choice
concerning
the
number
of
representatives.
if
the
deviation
from
the
state
benchmark
were
more
than
minor,
then
beens
would
tend
to
teach
that
that
alteration
would
not
be
allowed.
mr.
christopher
coates
it
might
be,
but
the--
mr.
christopher
coates
--no,
sir.
no,
because
the
increase
there,
your
honor,
would
be
not
because
of
the
claim
of
proportional
representation,
but
because
the
expansion
would
be
tied
to
the
benchmark
established
by
state
law,
as
is
the
case
here.
mr.
christopher
coates
no,
sir.
the...
in
this
case,
i
would
respectfully
beg
to
differ.
the
court
did
not
say...
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say,
in
suggesting
the
use
of
the
five
single-member
district
plan,
that
that
was
done
to
effectuate
proportional
representation.
it
chose
the
five
single-member
district
plan
because
it
would
have
been
choosing
an
alternative
system
which
was
established
by
a
benchmark
of
state
policy.
mr.
christopher
coates
it
had
that
incidental
effect,
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
coates
the...
if
the
plan
was
drawn
as
the
board
of
education...
if
the
board
of
education
plan
was
adopted,
then
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
that
would
be
drawn
on
strictly
a
race-conscious
basis,
because
that
is
the
very
plan
adopted
by
the
georgia
general
assembly
in
1983
for
school
board
elections,
so
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
suggesting--
mr.
christopher
coates
--yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
coates
no,
it
does
not
have
to
be
because
of
proportional
representation.
it
would
have
to
be
because
of
the
finding
of
vote
dilution,
your
honor,
is
affirmed
by
this
court,
then
the
district
court,
in
determining
the
remedy,
would
have
the
responsibility
of
implementing
a
plan
that
would
cure
the
vote
dilution
effect.
that
would
be
the
general
standard.
mr.
christopher
coates
to--
mr.
christopher
coates
--no,
sir.
mr.
christopher
coates
no,
sir,
and
a
system--
mr.
christopher
coates
--yes,
they
do
not
participate
equally,
black
and
white
people
in
bleckley
county,
because
the
fact
that
there
would
be
224
people
appointed
as
poll
managers
over
a
8-year
period
and
not
one
of
those
people
would
be
black,
would
show
that
participation
in
the
voting
process
in
this
county
is
manifestly
not
equal.
black
people
have
to
go
to
the
polls,
but
they
are
run
by
white
people.
there
was
testimony
in
the
case
that
that
deterred
some
black
people
from
voting.
they
have
to
go
to
the
polls
and
vote
in
an
all-white
private
club.
that's
not
equal
participation.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir,
they
do.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
coates
the
choice
of
having
all-white
managers--
mr.
christopher
coates
--yes,
sir.
well,
the
congress
said
in
section
2,
and
it's
right
in
the
face
of
the
statute,
that
the
failure
of
a
minority
group
member
to
be
elected
is
one
factor
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
the
system
is
vote-dilutive.
there
are
many
cases
that
come
to
this
court,
such
as
gingles,
where
there
has
been
some
success
by
minority
candidates.
in
this
case,
on
a
county-wide
basis
since
1912,
there
has
been
zero
success.
mr.
christopher
coates
if
the--
mr.
christopher
coates
--if
the
benchmark
for
testing
the
sufficiency
and
size
requirement
were
5,
as
we
maintain
it
is
in
this
case,
then
if
the
minority
population
were
12,
that
would
create
severe
problems
for
satisfying
the
size
and
compactness
requirement
of
gingles.
i
haven't
done
that
mathematically,
i
haven't
done
that
hypothetical,
your
honor,
but
i
would
concede
that
it
would
create
a
problem
in
satisfying
the
sufficiency
and
size
requirement
under
the
benchmark--
mr.
christopher
coates
--yes,
sir,
and
i
have
filed
such
a
suit.
mr.
christopher
coates
no,
sir,
i
would
not
concede
that
i
wouldn't
have
a
case,
but
certainly
that
would
take
away
the
antidotal
evidence,
the
nonstatistical
evidence
of
racial
polarization
that
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
to.
mr.
christopher
coates
well,
i
wouldn't
be
left
with
just
that
fact.
for
example,
there
was
a--
mr.
christopher
coates
--well,
for
example,
there
was
a
finding
by
the
district
court,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
black
people
in
bleckley
county
continue
to
suffer
from
the
effects
of
racial
discrimination
in
housing
and
employment
and
areas
like
that,
and
that--
mr.
christopher
coates
--because--
mr.
christopher
coates
--because
that's
one
of
the
factors
that
the
senate
report
pointed
to
as
bearing
upon
the
question
of
equal
participation,
and
both
the
district
court,
i
think,
importantly,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
found
that
that
present
depressed
socioeconomic
status
hindered
the
ability...
and
this
is
what
the
district
court
said,
even
though
that
judge
ruled
against
us...
hindered
the
ability
of
black
people
to
vote
and
run
for
office.
only
15
percent
of
the
black
people
in
bleckley
county
have
high
school
educations
in
a
system--
mr.
christopher
coates
--if
the
georgia
general
assembly
authorized
the
holding
of
another
referendum,
yes,
you
could,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a...
in
the
appendix,
there
have
been
the
consent
orders
in
some
of
the
cases
which
have
been
settled.
for
example,
in
webster
county
there
was
a
sole
commissioner,
there
was
an
expansion
to
a
three-member
commission
elected
from
single-member
districts,
and
an
at-large
commissioner
who
would
serve
as
the
county
administrative
official,
so
that's
how
in
one
of
the
counties
the
problem
has
been
resolved.
there
has...
there's
no
evidence
that
in
any
of
these
counties
have
the
cases
been
resolved
on
the
basis
of
expanding
the
membership
of
a
sole
commissioner
to
50
or
100
commissioners.
mr.
christopher
coates
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case,
because
there
would
be
a
policy,
a
state
policy
applied
across
the
board
to
counties
that
would
establish
either
a
one-person
commission
or
a
three-person
commission.
mr.
christopher
coates
because
in
determining
the
benchmark
for
the
increase,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
federal
courts
to
give
deference
to
the
state
policy
established
in
that
benchmark.
the
federal
courts
would
not
be
at
liberty
to
just
create
numbers
so
as
to
achieve
some
type
of
proportional
representation,
but
they...
but
the--
mr.
christopher
coates
--yes.
mr.
christopher
coates
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
christopher
coates
--yes,
sir.
it
is
mentioned
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
2,
where
it
says
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
state's
policy
is
tenuous,
you
look
to
how
the
state
has
treated
other
jurisdictions
in
a
state.
the
state
policy
is
not
established
by
what
happens
in
bleckley
county.
the
state
policy
is
established
by
comparing
how
bleckley
county
is
treated
with
other
counties
in
the
state.
mr.
christopher
coates
the
only
place
that
it
is
referred
to
is
not
in
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
in
the
seven
senate
factors.
the
tenuousness
of
the
state
policy
is--
mr.
christopher
coates
--yes,
ma'am.
that
would
be
one
of
the
factors
that
a
court
would
appropriately
look
at.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes.
the
only
analysis
that
i'm
saying,
or
presenting
to
the
court,
is
that
the
federal
court
would
not
be
permitted
to
completely
disregard
the
state's
policy,
but
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
christopher
coates
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
coates
that's
correct,
a
state
practice
establishes
the
benchmark,
and
it
would
be
a
different
case--
mr.
christopher
coates
--that's
correct,
because
i
think
section
2
shows
that
there's
a
demonstrated
federal
interest
to
cure
the
problem
of
vote
dilution
in
the
united
states.
i
mean,
it's
nationwide,
and
so
if
there's
vote
dilution
found,
and
there's
a
federal
interest
in
correcting
that,
then
if
you're
going
to
give
some
special
weight
to
the
state's
interest,
it
at
least
ought
to
be
an
interest
that
has
been
applied
by
the
state
in
some
type
of
systematic
manner,
not--
mr.
christopher
coates
--if
i
said
there--
mr.
christopher
coates
--well,
if
i
said
that
there
wasn't
vote
dilution
under
the
single
commissioner
form
in
bleckley
county,
i
did
not
intend
to
say
that.
mr.
christopher
coates
it
would
depend
upon
the
particular
circumstances
or
evidence
in
that
particular
jurisdiction.
thank
you,
your
honor.
