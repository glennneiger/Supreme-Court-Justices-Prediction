justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
that
means
that
if,
for
instance,
we
had
a
situation
where
some
counties
had
three-member
commissions
and
others
had
five-member
commissions,
that
if
minority
voters
in
a
three-member
commission
county
sued
under
section
2
seeking
a
five-member
commission,
you
would
say
that,
as
in
this
case,
section
2
just
doesn't
cover
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
wasn't
a
change
in
the--
--well--
--houston
lawyers
case.
that
was
a
case
of
voters
seeking
a
change.
that
was
judges
elected
county-wide--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
each
judge--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
this
case
appeared,
at
least,
in
houston
lawyers,
to
reject
the
kind
of
blanket
exclusion
from
section
2
that
you're
urging.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
were
a
number
of
judges
elected
by
the
voters
county-wide.
each
judge
was
voted
on
county-wide
by
the
voters,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
each
one
elected
county-wide,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
what's
the
distinction?
what
is
the
principle
for
your
distinction?
i
don't
get
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
congress
really
did
intend
in
section
2
to
authorize
dilution
claims
to
the
various
single-member
offices
found
around
the
country--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--county
sheriff,
county
treasurer,
county
attorney,
so
forth
and
so
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
certainly
didn't
in
language
in
the
statute
draw
a
legislative
or
executive
distinction,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
coates,
i
don't
find
anything,
actually,
in
section
2
that
says
you
defer
to
state
policy.
if
you
find
vote
dilution
then
there's
a
violation
and
a
federal
remedy
is
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
determine
the
dilution
question,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
dilution
is
found,
then
i
suppose
a
remedy
is
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
it's
a
little
hard
to
read
the
limiting
principle
into
the
language
of
the
statute.
