justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
another,
sort
of
more
basic...
let's
assume
you
have
a
history
with
just
one
commissioner,
as
you
have,
you
never
had
anything
else,
but
assume
that...
and
contrary
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
assume
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
that
the
reason
that
they
had
maintained
the
single-member
district,
or
single
commissioner
form
of
government,
was
to
prevent
the
black
voters
from
having
an
opportunity
to
elect
a
representative.
just
say
there's
abundant
evidence
of
intent,
and
that's
why
they
lost
the
last
election
when
they
tried
to
change
it,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
would
that
be
a
violation,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand
it
might
violate
the
constitution.
i'm
asking
if
it
violates
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
tell
me
in
very
short...
two
different
words,
yes
or
no,
probably,
i'd
find
out
what
your
position
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
prove
it
from
1865
to
today.
they
had
this
government
for
that
very
reason
and
no
other
reason,
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
doing
it.
section
2
violation,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
is
yes,
that
would
be
a
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand,
but
you
do
seem
to
be
willing
to
acknowledge
that
if
it
were
motivated
solely
by
racial
animus
and
discriminatory
intent
and
all
the
invidious
language
we
can
put
into
it,
that
situation
would
constitute
a
violation
of
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
also
prove
the
three
gingles
factors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure,
you
have
to
prove
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
with
the
kind
of
intent
i've
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
changed...
justice
scalia
has
persuaded
you
to
change
your
position.
[laughter]
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
make
that
concession
before
you
had
a
little
help.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
his
salary
determined?
is
that
fixed
by
state
law,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
is.
in
these
five-member
commission
districts,
are
the
salaries
of
the
commissioners
fixed
by
state
law,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
it
cost
the
county
five
times
as
much
to
have
five
commissioners
instead
of
one,
or
are
they
a
lesser
salary
because
they
only
have
legislative
duties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
if
your
financial
concern
might
be
met
by
hiring
your
one
administrator
to
do
most
of
the
work
and
then
have
these
five
commissioners
on
a
part-time,
low-salaried
basis.
all
you'd
have
is
the
small
amount
of
additional
salary
for
the
part-time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
the
evidence
showed
that
it
wouldn't
cost
a
penny
more,
you'd
get
volunteers,
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
interference
with
the
efficiency
of
the
government,
it's
just
an
absolute
rule
regardless
of
how
trivial
the
state
justification
might
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
outside
the
coverage
of
the
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
dilutive,
right.
