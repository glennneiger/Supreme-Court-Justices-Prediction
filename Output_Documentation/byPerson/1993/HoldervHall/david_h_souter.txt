justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
your
position
that
in
a
multiofficial
district,
if
the
lines
were
not
redrawn,
let's
say,
that
there
never
could
be
a
dilution
claim?
let's
assume
you
had
a
county
with...
that
elected
three
commissioners,
its
population
had
been
static
for
the
last
50
years.
is
it
your
position
there
could
never
be
a
dilution
claim
brought
against
that
county?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
let
me
interrupt
you,
if
i
may.
maybe
i
don't
understand
you.
i
thought
you
were
taking
a
position
that
there
could
be
a
challenge
only
if
there
had
been
some
change
by
the
county
in
the
manner
in
which
the
electoral
district
was
established.
was
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
is
the
case
different
in
a
multiofficial
district
than
it
is
from
the
district
before
us,
where
there's
only
one
commissioner?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
grant
you
that,
but
if
change
by
the
government
in
the
manner
of
disposing
of
its
authority
is
not
a
precondition
in
non-single-member
districts,
why
should
it
be
a
precondition
in
a
single-member
district?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
there
isn't,
don't
you
lose?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can
state
that
whenever
the
government,
for
example,
goes
from
a
multimember
district
to
a
single-member
district.
if
that's
true,
you'll
never
have
a
dilution
claim
in
those
cases,
either.
justice
david
h.
souter
will
you?
you'll
never
have
a
dilution
claim
in
those
cases
on
your
reasoning,
will
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the
county,
for
example,
decided
to
go
from
a
multimember
district
to
three
single-member
districts,
and
it
did
it
in
a
carefully
crafted
way
that
would
exclude
any
minority
election,
on
your
theory,
there
never
would
be
a
dilution
claim
in
that
kind
of
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
that
somebody
is
asleep
under
section
5.
the
question
is
whether
you
have
got
a
section
2
claim,
and
on
your
reasoning,
you
would
not
have,
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
your
reasoning,
you
never
would
have
a
dilution
claim,
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
this
just
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
why
not?
isn't
that
what
we
usually
do,
and
if
so,
why
don't
we
do
it
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
can
you
satisfy
the
gingles
factors
after
a
change
but
not
be
able
to
satisfy
the
gingles
factors
before
a
change?
justice
david
h.
souter
one-member
district,
same
factors.
what's
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that...
that
doesn't
respond
to
the
question.
i
thought
you
said
you
can
never
satisfy
the
gingles
factors
when
you're
dealing
with
a
dilution
claim
on
a
single-member
district,
and
you
just
said
yes,
you
can
do
that
if
there's
been
a
change
to
a
single-member
district,
and
i
don't
see
why
that's
consistent
with
your
position
that
gingles
can
never
be
satisfied
in
single-member
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay--
justice
david
h.
souter
--can
you
satisfy
that
first
factor
in
a
single-member
district
which
is
new,
as
opposed
to
one
which
is
old?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
can
you
satisfy
it
in
a
new
single-member
district?
what's
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
change
may...
the
change
may
go
to
your
intent.
the
change
may
go
to
the
measurement
of
the
dilution
which
you
make
after
the
gingles
factors
are
satisfied,
but
i
don't
see
what
it's
got
to
do
with
the
question
whether
you
can
satisfy
the
factors,
and
in
particular
the
first
one,
any
better
or
any
worse
whether
it's
a
new
single-member
district
or
an
old
single-member
district.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
agree
with
me,
then
don't
you
also
have
to
go
back
to
your
concession
that
there
can
be
the
possibility
of
a
dilution
claim
in
an
existing
single-member
district?
don't
you
have
to
go
back
to
your
first
answer
to
justice
stevens?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the
intent
to
discriminate
is
not
the
essence
of
section
2.
this
isn't
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
may
have
a
very
different...
i
mean,
you
do,
it
seems
to
me,
have
a
very
different
argument
when
you
in
effect
say,
well,
where
are
you
going
to
stop,
are
you
going
to
impose
a
100-member
commission,
and
so
on
and
on,
but
that's
a
very
different
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
really
have
to
rest
your
case
on
this
distinction?
why...
i
thought
your
argument
rested
at
least
equally
well
and,
i
guess
i
would
suggest
maybe
more
strongly,
on
your
reference
to
tradition
in
effect
as
a
source
of
benchmark,
and
if
you
do
that,
you
don't
have
to
get
wrapped
up
in
the
question
of
whether
someone
is
performing
executive
or
legislative
function,
you
in
effect
look
to
some
historical
basis,
if
you
can
find
one,
for
your
benchmark.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
that,
but
doesn't
it
equally
address
the
question
whether
the
office
in
issue
is
one
which
may
be
subject
to
a
section
2
claim
if
it
is,
as
in
this
particular
case,
a
single-member
office?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
have
to
get
executive
and
legislative
in
there
at
all?
why
don't
you
just
look
to
the
number
of
the
office?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
concede
that
it
is
essential
to
make
a
legislative
executive
distinction
in
order
to
support
your
position
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
were
to
change
the
facts
that
you've
given
us,
and
if
the
county
had
been
from
your
standpoint
perhaps
more
prudent,
and
had
been
careful
to
appoint
a
racial
mixture
among
its
poll-watchers,
and
if
it
had
set
up
polling
places
in
public
schools,
and
so
on,
are
you
conceding
that
you
would
not
have
a
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
would
be
left
simply
with
the...
you
would
be
left
simply
with
the
fact,
under
those
circumstances,
that
there
had
never
been
a
black
commissioner.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
else
would
you
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what's
that
got
to
do
with
participation?
justice
david
h.
souter
under
section
2?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it
the
nub
of
your
argument
that
dilution
is
in
effect
a
question
involving
comparisons,
and
what
the
appropriate
comparison
may
be,
you
assume,
congress
intended
to
be
established
by
looking
to
traditional
practice
within
a
state?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
ultimately
you're
saying,
what
is
an
appropriate
comparison
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent,
and
congressional
intent
was,
look
to
what
they
have
been
doing
within
the
state
for
other
possible,
reasonable
comparisons.
