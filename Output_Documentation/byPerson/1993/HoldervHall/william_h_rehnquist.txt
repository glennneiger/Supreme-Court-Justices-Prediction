we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-2012,
jackie
holder
v.
e.
k.
hall.
mr.
murphy,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
murphy.
mr.
coates,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
mean
they're
not
responsible
to...
directly
responsible
to
an
electorate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
coates,
you
said,
i
thought,
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question
that
you
look
all
around
the
country
for
a
benchmark
so
that
even
if
all
of
the
250
or
whatever
it
is
counties
they
have
in
georgia
all
had
single
commissioners,
you
might
find
a
benchmark
out
in
the
state
of
oregon,
say,
where
perhaps
they
all
had...
the
counties
had
five-member
commissions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
you
found
all
single
commissioners
in
georgia,
could
you
look
any
further?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wouldn't
be
conclusive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
thinking
of
texas,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coates.
mr.
murphy,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
