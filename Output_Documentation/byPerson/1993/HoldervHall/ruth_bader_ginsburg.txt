bader

but
since
you've
conceded
that
you
can
look
to
the
way
it
was...
let's
say
you
go
from
five
and
shrink
it
to
three,
or
even
to
one,
you
concede
there
could
be
a
dilution
case
that
plaintiffs
could
win
by
showing
the
way
it
was
when
it
was
five,
and
the
way
it
is
when
it's
three
or
one.
so
you
can
compare
what
was
to
what
is,
but
you
can't
compare
what
is
to
what
will
be?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
why--
--why?
--why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
conceded
that
if
you
went...
if
you
had
a
system
of
five,
and
you
went
to
a
system
of
one,
even
though
it
was
only
one,
there
might
be
a
section
2
claim
of
voter
dilution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
you
end
up
with
one,
and
you
conceded
that
you...
the
test
of
the
"if"
is
to
compare
what
was
to
what
is,
and
so
we're
now
back...
since
you
can
make
some
comparison,
why
can't
you
compare
what
will
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
counties
are
left
that
have
this
system?
it's
dwindling,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
fourteen
are
left,
and
is
it
so
that
georgia's
the
only
state
that
has
a
single
commissioner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
have
recently
changed,
do
you
know,
from--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not...
if
you've
always
had
it,
it
can
never
be
a
violation,
but
if
you
changed
to
get
a
one-member
district,
then
you
could
have
a
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
some
assumed,
and
i
think
the
concession
is
made
that
you
just
couldn't
pick
a
number
that
would
happen
to
give
you
proportional
representation.
the
number
that
has
been
picked
here
that's
allegedly
the
benchmark
is
the
most
frequent
form,
the
five-member
commission,
so
it's
not
just
a
number
that
is
pulled
out
of
a
hat.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
at
least
it's
an
answer
to
your
argument
that
where
do
you
stop?
i
mean,
you
can
have
20
members,
just
as
long
as
you
come
up
with
the
number
that
happens
to
give
you
a
representative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
the
answer
is
the
only
position
taken
in
this
case
is
that
where
you
have
what
they
call
benchmarks,
five
or
three,
that
you
could
use
those,
not
that
you
could
use
anything
other
than
those,
but
that
you
must
have
solid
precedent
for
those.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
the
state
proposed
changing
this
single
commissioner
system
for
this
county,
they
did
propose...
wasn't
it
a
five-member
board
that
was
proposed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
it
'85
or
'86?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
those...
those
were
not...
were
they
at
the
same
time,
the
school
board
and
the
commissioner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
pays
the
county
commissioners?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
you
made
the
argument
that
it
would
cost
more
to
have
a
five-member
commission?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
11...
the
number's
11,
not
14?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
court
went
with
you,
as
i
understand
it,
the
first
two
steps
of
the
way.
where
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
divided
was
on
what
has
been
called
the
second
two
gingles
factors.
would
you
explain
on
what
basis
you
think
that
your
case
meets
those
second
two
requirements,
the
cohesiveness
on
the
part
of
the
minority
community
and
the
bloc
voting
on
the
part
of
the
majority
community?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
wouldn't
have
to
look
at
anything
other
than
if
you
had
a
minority
population
that
would
always
be
the
case.
then
no
single-member
system
would
be
permissible.
there
was
no
proof
of
any
kind
with
respect
to
the
division
of
the
votes
at
the
time
of
the
referendum
minority-majority
votes
for
and
against,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
minority
population
were
12
percent,
you
would
have
no
case,
is
that...
are
you
recognizing
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose,
instead
of
being
close
to
20,
it
was
12
percent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
coates,
could
you
have
another
referendum?
the
state
proposed
it
in
'85-'86,
and
it
seemed
that
there
wasn't
much
of
an
interest
in
either
community
in
voting
in
that
referendum,
but
if
the
preference,
the
strong
minority
preference
is
for
a
five-member
commission,
could
you
have
another
referendum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
information
in
this
record
about
what
happened
in
the
other
counties,
now
we've
got
this
number
that's
now
dwindled
to
11,
and
they
went
from
one
to
a
larger
number?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
murphy,
if
we
were
to
look
at
the
district
court
decision
and
go
that
far,
reject
your
argument
as
far
as
the
district
court
did,
what
would
your
argument
be
about
what
it
would
take
to
satisfy
the
factors
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
were
not
satisfied
in
this
case,
the
bloc
voting
and
cohesiveness?
let's
say
that
you
lose
on
your
main
argument,
and
we're
back
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
says,
in
my
view,
this
case
fails
for
lack
of
proof
on
those
two
items,
what
would
be
adequate
proof?
