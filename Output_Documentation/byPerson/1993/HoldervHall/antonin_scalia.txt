justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
murphy--
--i
thought
you
said
that
you
could
compel
a
change
from
three
to
five,
that
there
had
been
a
certain
change
in
the
demographics.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
impossible,
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
therefore,
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
section
2--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right?
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
don't
you
say
it
would
not
be
a
violation?
it's
perfectly
awful,
it's
horrible,
there
may
be
a
constitutional
remedy,
but
it's
not
a
violation
of
section
2.
isn't
that
your
position?
otherwise,
i
haven't
understood
your
briefs.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
perhaps
the
same
statement
could
have
been
made
at
least
20
years
ago
with
respect
to
the
president
of
the
united
states...
if
i
were
a
black
person,
i
wouldn't
run
for
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
don't
stand
a
chance
of
getting
elected?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
does
that
render
that
unlawful?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
system
of
government,
one
elected
president?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
governorship
of
some
states?
if
you
could
make
the
same
statement
about
the
governorship,
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
a
statute
that
talks
about
intent.
i
don't
see
how
whether
it's
a
true
single-member
or
non-single-member
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
there's
nothing
like
that
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
when
we
say,
it's
not
a
true
single-member,
that
implies,
you
know,
this
has
been
done...
made
a
single-member
with
the
intent
of
disadvantaging
blacks,
but
this
is
not
an
intent
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
looks
to
the
consequence,
whatever
the
intent
was,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
intent
component?
which
one
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
requires
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
my
question
stands.
you
don't
need
intent
to
make
it
invalid,
so
why
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
this
was
a
natural
one-person
district
or
not
a
natural
one?
the
only
thing
that
goes
to
show
is
that
somebody
had
a
bad
intent,
but
you
don't
need
a
bad
intent
to
show
a
violation
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
executive
offices,
is
that
it?
section
2
does
not
address
executive
offices?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
truly
executive...
i've
spent
much
of
my
life
in
administrative
law
trying
to
figure
out
what's
executive
and
what's
legislative,
but
you
very
clearly
see
that
some
things
are
truly
executive
and
other
things
truly
legislative.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
truly
legislative,
this
particular
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
federal
agencies
that
can
issue
regulations?
are
they
executive
agencies,
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
they
can
make
all
sorts
of
rules
just
the
way
this
county
commission
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
pass
regulations.
it's
the
same
things
as
ordinances.
you
violate
them,
you
go
to
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
came
the
closest
to
giving
proportional
representation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
coates,
we
said
in
chisom
v.
roemer...
and
i
didn't
agree
with
our
saying
it,
but
we
said
it,
and
maybe
we
said
it
in
order
to
get
around
this
problem
of
converting
section
2
against
its
plain
text
into
a
provision
that
provides
proportional
representation.
we
said
that
you
have
to
show
two
things,
not
just
inability
to
elect,
but
you
have
to
show,
in
addition,
lack
of
opportunity,
equal
opportunity
to
participate.
in
other
words,
we
read
the
two
clauses
of
section
2
as
being
cumulative.
now,
has
there...
what
lack
of
equal
opportunity
to
participate
does
there
exist
in
this
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
everybody
in
the
county,
when
voting
for
this
one
member,
participate
in
the
electoral
process
equally?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
how
you
say
they
can't
elect
by
race
with
this
much
facility,
but
how
do
they
participate
unequally?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
have
the
same
ballot?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
vote
for
the
same
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
excluded
from
the
polls,
nobody
excludes
them
from
the
polls.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
they
cannot
elect
a
member
of
their
own
race
and
that
affects
the
outcome,
but
that's
the
elect
provision,
not
the
participate
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not...
could
not
give
deference
to
the
county
policy.
i
mean,
you're
willing
to
have
us
override
the
county
voters,
who
want
one,
even
though
the
state
wants
to
defer
to
those
county
voters--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
somehow
we
can't
override
the
state,
just
the
county,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
is
there
some
principle
of
law
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
talk
about
vote
dilution
as
though
it's
something
objective,
but
you've
told
us
it
isn't
objective,
that
there's
no
such
thing
as
vote
dilution
if
you've
had
a
single-member
office
all
along.
that
isn't
vote
dilution,
even
though
the
same
system
set
up
somewhere
else
is
vote
dilution
if...
i
don't
now,
if
it
hasn't
been
a
uniform
state
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
vote
dilution
means.
it's
a
meaningless
term.
it's
entirely
relative,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
but
you
said
in
another
state
there
wouldn't
be.
if
another
state
had
all
single-member
people,
that
wouldn't
be
vote
dilution,
even
though
the
votes
would
be
diluted
to
the
same
degree,
but
that
wouldn't
be
"vote
dilution"
as
you've
been
talking
about,
isn't
that
right?
