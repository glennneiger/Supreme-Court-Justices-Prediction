justice
anthony
m.

suppose
there
were
a
commission,
a
county
commission
of
five
commissioners,
and
it
was
shrunk
to
three,
allegedly
causing
a
dilution,
would
there
be
a
section
2
remedy
for
the
court
in
that
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no...
no,
i
said
section
2.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
no,
my
hypothetical
is
that
the
commission,
as
constituted,
has
five
commissioners.
it
is
then
reduced
to
three.
is
there
a
section
2
violation
if
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
a
dilution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
not
intentional.
suppose
it's
not
intentional
and
it's
not
covered
by
section
5.
suppose
it's
not
a
section
5
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
overarching
proposition
that
section
2
does
not
apply
to
changes
in
the
size
of
a
governing
body
has
at
least
one
exception
in
the
case
that
i
put.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
what
your
proposition
is.
i
thought
that
you'd
stated
at
the
outset
that
section
2
is
not
applicable
to
changes
in
the
size
of
governmental
entities,
and
i
put
this
hypothetical
designed
to
test
that,
and
i'm
still
not
sure
of
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
then
the
courts
are,
in
that
instance,
interfering
with
a
governmental
decision
as
to
what
the
size
of
the
governing
body
ought
to
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
just
a
difference
between
an
act
of
omission
and
of
commission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
have
a
jurisdiction
in
which,
say,
there
are
four
races,
and
one
race
is
10
percent,
and
that
race
has
had
difficulty
in
electing
its
representative,
i
take
it
under
your
principle
we
would
have
to
go
to
proportional
representation
and
have,
say,
a
10-person
commission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
there
were
a
benchmark
that
permitted
a
governing
body
of
a
size
which
would
give
proportional
representation
to
the
excluded
race,
then
it
is
your
position
that
they
would
have
to
reconform
the
district
accordingly,
is
it
not,
in
the
case
that
i
put?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
basically
what
you
have
is
proportional
representation
in
every
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
is
the
objective?
the
objective
is
to
allow
racial
representation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
incidental?
that
was
the
whole
object
of
it,
wasn't
it?
well,
let
me
ask
you
this...
let
me
ask
you
this:
suppose
the...
we
affirm
the
finding
that
there
should
be
a
five-member
district.
those
districts
would
have
to
be
drawn
on
a
race-conscious
basis
to
comply
with
your
theory,
would
they
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
were
no...
suppose
there
were
no
existing
precincts,
and
this
case
goes
back,
is
race
a
factor
in
drawing
the
new
district
lines?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
has
to
be,
doesn't
it,
so
there
can
be
proportional
representation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
practices
of
having
all
white
commissioners,
or
poll-watchers,
can
that
not
be
challenged
separately
under
section
2,
or
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
throughout
georgia
the
choice
were
between
having
either
a
one-commissioner
system
or
a
three-commissioner
system,
and
suppose
further
that
in
bleckley
county
the
increment
from
one
to
three
would
not
result
in
the
election
of
any
representatives
of
the
black
community.
what
then
would
be
your
position
as
to
the
appropriate
remedy?
could
the
court
then
order
five?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
it's
necessary
to
cure
a
violation,
how
can
a
state
policy
thwart
a
federal
statute?
