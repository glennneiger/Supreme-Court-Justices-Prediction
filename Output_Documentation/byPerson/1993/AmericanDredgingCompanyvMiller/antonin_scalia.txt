justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wagner,
even
if
you're
correct
that
it
was
first
enunciated
in
dictum
in
admiralty
cases
in
this
country,
was
it
first
enunciated
in
the
common
law
in
admiralty
cases?
my
impression
was
that
in
the
english
cases
it
first
came
up
not
in
admiralty
cases
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask
you
what
you
meant
when
you
said
earlier
that
it's
important
that
this
doctrine
be
applied
uniformly?
does
that
mean
that
you
would
say
that
a
state
court
could
not
be
neither
more
restrictive
nor
less
restrictive
in
its
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens?
justice
antonin
scalia
neither
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
but
i'm...
you
would
say
that
a
state,
even
if
it
wants
to
exclude
on
the
basis
of
forum
non
conveniens
more
cases
than
the
federal
courts
would
exclude,
it
cannot
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
justice
ginsburg's
point
is
that
when
you
have
discretion
that
broad,
different
trial
judges
are
going
to
come
to
different
results,
widely
different
results
on
the
basis
of
the
same
facts,
exactly
what
discretion
is
all
about.
you
can't
pretend
that
you're
going
to
get
uniformity
of
result.
once
you...
it's
just
contradictory
to
argue
that
in
the
interest
of
uniformity
we
must
have
everybody
adopt
this
discretionary
doctrine.
you're
not
going
to
get
uniformity.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it
isn't
worth
anything
to
the
general
maritime
law,
if
you
can't
be
sure
you're
going
to
get
the
same
results
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
uniform
rule
which
says
that
a
court
can
do
anything
it
wants
is
a
uniform
rule,
but
it's
not
very
helpful.
well,
as
i
understand
you,
you're
not
saying
that
the
court
can
do
anything
it
wants,
you're
saying
that
if
the
facts
are
so
extreme,
as
perhaps
they
are
in
this
case,
that
it
would
always
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
the
motion,
you
ought
to
be
entitled
to
it
in
those
extreme
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
that
extent,
it's
a
uniform
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that'll
be
very
rare.
let
me
ask
you
why
you
think
uniformity
is
helpful,
or
needful
in
this
area.
as
i
understand
it,
maritime
law
proceeds
from
the
assumption
that
international
commerce
has
to
have
stable
rules
and
uniform
rules,
but
i
thought
that
was
so
that
people
could
rely
upon
those
rules
in
formulating
their
conduct,
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
conduct.
it's
not
something
that
one
relies
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
how
you
keep
your
ship,
how
you
execute
your
contracts,
all
of
those
things
are
not
affected
by
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
presumably
the
same
law
is
going
to
apply
no
matter
where
the
suit
is
brought.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
suggests
that
the
last
situation
you
describe
could
be
handled
by
leaving
open
the
possibility
of
a
separate
rule
for
cases
where
you
have
foreign
defendants
or
plaintiffs.
what
do
you
think?
would
you
like
half
a
loaf
rather
than
none?
is
there
something
wrong
with
that
proposal?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
the
respondent,
william
robert
miller,
was
injured
while
working
as
a
seaman
board
a
tug
operating
on
the
delaware
river
and
owned
by
the
petitioner,
american
dredging
company,
a
pennsylvania
corporation
with
its
principal
place
of
business
in
new
jersey.
after
returning
home
to
mississippi,
miller
brought
this
action
for
damages
under
what
is
called
the
savings
to
suitors
clause
of
the
united
states
code,
28
u.s.c.
section
1333(1),
and
under
the
jones
act
which
is
46
u.s.c.
app.
section
688.
he
brought
that
suit
in
the
civil
district
court,
the
state
district
court,
for
orleans,
louisiana.
that
court,
however,
granted
american
dredging's
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
under
which
a
court
may
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction
if
a
more
appropriate
forum
exists.
the
district
court
concluded
that
federal
maritime
law
which
governs
the
merits
of
miller's
claim
required
application
of
forum
non
conveniens
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
louisiana
code
of
civil
procedure
purports
to
render
that
doctrine
unavailable
in
maritime
cases
brought
in
louisiana
state
courts.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
reversed
holding
that
louisiana's
statutory
prohibition
of
forum
non
conveniens
is
not
preempted
by
federal
maritime
law.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm.
in
admiralty
cases
filed
in
a
state
court,
federal
law
does
not
preempt
state
law
regarding
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
we
have
long
held
that
state
court's
hearing
admiralty
cases
may
adapt
such
remedies
as
they
see
fit
so
long
as
those
remedies
do
not
materially
prejudice
what
we
have
called
characteristic
features
or
interfere
with
the
proper
uniformity
of
admiralty
law.
because
forum
non
conveniens
did
not
originate
in
admiralty
and
is
a
doctrine
of
general
application
not
limited
to
admiralty,
we
think
it
not
a
characteristic
feature
of
admiralty
law.
moreover,
application
of
forum
non
conveniens
is
not
necessary
to
assure
proper
uniformity
of
admiralty
law
for
two
reasons:
first,
it
is
really
a
supervening
venue
rule
procedural
in
nature
rather
than
a
substantive
rule
upon
which
maritime
actors
rely
in
making
decisions
about
how
to
manage
their
business
affairs;
and
secondly,
it
is
unlikely
to
produce
uniformed
results
anyway
because
the
doctrine
vests
enormous
discretion
in
the
trial
court
and
encompasses
multifarious
factors
in
its
application.
our
conclusion
is
confirmed
by
prior
decisions
under
the
jones
act
and
the
federal
employers
liability
act
which
imply
that
federal
venue
rules
including
forum
non
conveniens
are
matters
of
judicial
housekeeping
prescribed
only
for
the
federal
courts.

opinion;
