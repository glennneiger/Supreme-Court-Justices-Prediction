well,
the
louisiana
statute
doesn't
require
that
it
be...
that
the
corporation...
the
defendant
be
doing
business
there,
does
it?
it's
just
minimum
contacts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
but
that's
minimum
contacts,
not
doing
business.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not...
is
that
a
limitation
on
the
jurisdictions
in
which
the
defendant
may
be
sued?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
are
two
different
doctrines?
the
source
of
the
forum
non
conveniens
argument
being
presented
in
this
case
has
a
different
source
than
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
as
applied
to
foreigners?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
fair
to
say...
you're
saying
that
there
are
two
different
forum
non
conveniens
doctrines,
one
for
foreign
parties
and
the
other
for
domestic
parties?
