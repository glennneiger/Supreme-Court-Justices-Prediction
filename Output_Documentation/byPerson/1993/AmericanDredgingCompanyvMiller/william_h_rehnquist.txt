chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1950,
american
dredging
company
v.
william
robert
miller.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk
until
you
leave
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
wagner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
in
england--
--mr.
wagner...
mr.
wagner,
the
fact
that
the
doctrine
may
have
come
up
and
been
applied
in
some
admiralty
cases
i
don't
think
negates
the
suggestion
from
justice
ginsburg
that
it
was
applied
across
the
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
applied
in
admiralty
cases
and
in
other
kinds
of
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
isn't
that--
--the
louisiana
courts
can't
transfer
this
case
to
pennsylvania,
can
they?
wouldn't
they
simply
have
to
dismiss
it
and
let
the
plaintiff
start
anew
in
pennsylvania?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
really,
your
procedures
in
state
court,
you
say
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
has
to
be
applied
uniformly,
but
whereas
a
federal
district
court
can
transfer
it
to
another
federal
district,
a
state
trial
court
can't
transfer
it
to
a
court
in
another
state.
it
has
to
go
by
a
quite
different
procedure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
one
is
suggesting
that
it
belonged
in
western
louisiana
rather
than
eastern
louisiana.
the
argument
is
it
belonged
in
pennsylvania,
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wagner.
mr.
falcon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
falcon.
mr.
manning,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manning.
mr.
wagner,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wagner.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-1950,
american
dredging
company
against
miller
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
