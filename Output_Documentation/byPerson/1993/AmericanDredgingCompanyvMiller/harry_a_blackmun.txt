mr.
wagner,
let
me
take
you
off
in
a
different
direction.
you've
been
speaking
of
uniformity
all
along.
this
case
is
between
domestic
parties,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
there
were
some
foreign
persons
involved
here.
would
you
have
different
considerations
that
enter
into
your
calculus?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
plaintiff
is
totally
disabled,
do
you
concede
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
in
mississippi,
true,
but
he's
not
very
far
from
new
orleans,
is
he?
