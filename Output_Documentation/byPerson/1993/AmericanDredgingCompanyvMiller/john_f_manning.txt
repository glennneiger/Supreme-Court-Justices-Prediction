mr.
john
f.
manning
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
just
wish
to
emphasize
three
points
very
briefly.
first,
as
this
court
recognized
in
miles
v.
apex
marine,
maritime
tort
law
is
now
a
field
dominated
by
federal
statute,
and
this
court
has
looked
repeatedly
to
the
jones
act
in
defining
the
tort
remedies
available
to
a
maritime
employee
like
respondent.
the
jones
act,
in
turn,
incorporates
by
reference
the
rights
and
remedies
given
to
railway
workers
under
the
fela,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
looked
to
fela
precedents
in
defining
the
scope
of
remedies
available
under
the
jones
act.
thus,
the
mayfield
case
is
highly
relevant
in
this
context,
because
there
the
court
held
that
under
the
fela
state
courts
are
free
to
apply
their
own
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
in
fela
cases.
that...
the
court
said
that
the
state
courts
are
free
to
accept
or
reject
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
in
those
cases.
thus,
mayfield
is
highly
relevant
here,
and
we
believe
that
it
disposes
of
the
case
both
as
to
the
jones
act
claim
and
as
to
the
unseaworthiness
and
maintenance
and
cure
claims.
mr.
john
f.
manning
yes,
your
honor.
the
united
states
does
not
take
a
position
on
whether
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
would
be
available...
would
be
a
preemptive
doctrine
of
federal
law
in
state
courts,
where
foreign
parties
and
events
are
involved.
i
would
note,
however,
that
the
united
states
urges
this
court
to
leave
that
question
open.
we
believe
that
the
considerations
in
such
cases
may
well
be
different,
for
two
reasons.
first,
where
foreign
parties
and
events
are
involved,
there
may
be,
in
addition
to
the
considerations
relied
on
by
petitioner,
considerations
involving
comity
and
reciprocity
that
implicate
greater
federal
interests.
secondly,
in
the
admiralty
cases
that
have
defined
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
going
back
to
willendson
v.
forsoket
in
1801
and
the
ship
lerow
in
1804,
the
doctrine
was
traditionally
articulated
in
terms
of
its
effect
on
foreign
parties.
the
court
would
typically
say,
we
have
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
however,
we
have...
the
trial
court
has
discretion
to
decline
to
hear
the
case
because
foreign
parties
are
involved.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
question
is
whether...
is
the
federal
interest
in
the
case,
and
we
believe
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
federal
interest
that's
implicated
when
foreign
parties
are
involved.
mr.
john
f.
manning
your
honor,
we're
saying
that
there
might
be,
and
that
the
court
should
reserve
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
but
in
the
admiralty
cases
traditionally
the
doctrine
was
applied
most
strongly
wherein
foreign
parties
are
involved.
but
again,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
united
states
is
not
taking
a
position
on
the
foreign
party
situation,
but
simply
urging
the
court
to
reserve
that
question.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
your
honor,
it
might
be
different
in
admiralty
cases,
because
there
is
a
tradition
of
admiralty
preemption
that
emanates
from
article
iii.
that
tradition
might
not
be
available
when
you
deal
with
other
forms
of
civil
litigation.
there's
a
tradition,
jensen
v.
southern
pacific
and
so
forth,
of
this
court's
finding
preemptive
force
of
admiralty
law
and
admiralty
cases
in
state
court,
so
it
may
be
a
different
answer
for
admiralty
cases.
again,
we're
simply
asking
the
court
to
leave
that--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--we
do
find
that
highly
significant,
and
in
the
domestic
context
we
would
note
that
the
jones
act
has
a
venue
provision
that
applies,
as
this
court
has
held,
only
in
federal
court.
in
fact,
this
court
has
said
that
under
the
jones
act
the
presumption
that
state
courts
are
entitled
to
control...
that
states
are
entitled
to
control
the
dockets
of
their
own
courts
was
left
undisturbed
by
congress,
and
we
think
that
is
also
highly
relevant
in
addressing
the
forum
non
conveniens
question,
because
it
shows
that
congress
believed
that
matters
of
state
court
forum
selection
were
matters
for
the
court...
were
matters
for
the
states
when
it
enacted
the
jones
act.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--your
honor,
traditionally
in
the
doctrine...
in
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
in
federal
admiralty
cases,
this
court
has
considered
whether
there
was
an
interest
on
the
part
of
a
foreign
party
in
whether
this
dispute
should
be
resolved.
for
example,
if
there
was
a
dispute
between
a
foreign
seaman
and
the
ship,
and
a
foreign
ship
over
wages,
there
was
typically
a
question
whether
that
was
the
kind
of
dispute
that
a
foreign...
that
the
foreign
country
would
want
resolved
by
the
question...
by
the
courts
of
this
nation.
sometimes
what
would
happen
is
the
court
would
consult
the
consul
of
that
foreign
country
and
get
in
a
sense
approval
before
it
would
proceed
with
the
case,
and
so
questions
of
comity
and
reciprocity
of
treatment--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that's
right,
your
honor,
and
that
goes
to
the
question
of
choice
of
law,
which
as
counsel
for
respondent
indicated
depends
in
part
on
the
flag
of
the
vessel,
the
nationality
of
the
seaman,
the
nationality
of
the
shipowner--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--it's
very
likely
that
the
jones
act
would
not
apply,
and
the
cases
which
would
suggest
that
are
romero
and
lauritsen
v.
larson,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
