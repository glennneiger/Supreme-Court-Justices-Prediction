mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
policy
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
which
is
articulated
in
article
123
c
of
our
code
of
civil
procedure,
is
not
barred
by,
nor
is
it
inconsistent
with,
congressional
policies
that
underlie
the
jones
act.
in
fact,
this
law
furthers
those
policies
by
ensuring
that
state
courts
of
louisiana
will
effectuate
the
jones
act's
broad
liberal
venue
provisions.
american
dredging
company
has
not
come
before
this
court
and
demonstrated
that
article
123
c,
as
it
applies
in
this
case,
is
unconstitutional,
and
that
is
really
the--
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
--if
i
can
clarify,
the
louisiana
statute
is
not
now
a
broad
forum
non
conveniens
application.
it
only
actually
was
enacted
to
allow
a
transfer
between
one
district
court
in
the
state
of
louisiana
to
another
one.
there
was
a
problem
that
was
recognized
in
the
trahan
case
in
louisiana,
that
because
of
our
civilian
tradition
which
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
is
foreign
to,
not
a
part
of,
louisiana
passed
this
article
to
allow
a
transfer
on
the
forum
non
conveniens
grounds
from
one
district
court
to
another,
and
at
the
same
time
they
did
allow
a
transfer
out
of
state--
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
--i'm
sorry,
a
dismissal
on
forum
non
conveniens
to
an
out-of-state
court
if
it
was
premised
on
a
federal
statute
only,
and
at
the
same
time,
they
decided
to
exempt
the
jones
act
from
that
type
of
dismissal.
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
well,
in
fact,
as
the
statute
operates,
the
fela
claim
can
be
transferred...
i'm
sorry,
dismissed
on
forum
non
conveniens.
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
yes,
ma'am.
i
believe
that
the
real
reason
is,
if
you
dismiss
a
fela
case
on
forum
non
conveniens,
the
case
will
be
transferred
most
likely
to
another
american
jurisdiction.
the
railroads
only
run
across
our
land.
if
you
get
dismissed
from
louisiana,
more
than
likely
you'll
be
in
missouri,
or
you'll
go
to
montana,
or
you'll
go
to
some
other
state.
a
dismissal
under
the
jones
act
on
forum
non
conveniens,
especially
today
with
the
multinational
corporations
and
the
broad
reach
of
where
these
people
are
being
sent
to,
especially
louisiana
and
other
people
that
work
on
these
ships,
they're
sent
all
around
the
world.
what
happens
when
you
go
around
the
world,
if
your
cause
of
action
arises
in
singapore
and
you
come
back
to
louisiana
and
you
get
dismissed
on
forum
non
conveniens,
you've
got
to
go
back
to
singapore.
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
the
first
thing
you'd
have
to
look
at
in
that
situation
is
whether
or
not
the
jones
act
applies.
you
do
the
lauritzen-rhoditis
analysis.
after
you
do
that
analysis,
if
the
jones
act
applies,
the
jones
act
as
a
congressional
announcement
says
the
plaintiff
has
the
right
to
file
suit
where
the
defendant
is
doing
business.
so
in
that
case,
louisiana,
if
they're
doing
business
in
louisiana,
we
meet
the
constitutional
minimum
requirements
of
substantial
justice
and
fair
play,
then
they
can
be
sued
there
in
furtherance
of
the
congressional
policy.
if
it's
foreign
litigants
and
the
jones
act
does
not
apply,
the
traditions
of
admiralty
have
actually
been
that
the
admiralty
court
of
the
united
states
will
hear
those
cases.
the...
it's
talked
about--
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
--the
louisiana
statute
is
the
same
requirements
as
this
court's
constitutional
requirements.
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
right.
the
doing
business
that
i'm
referring
to
is
the
section
6
of
the
fela
act
itself,
which
says
the
employer
can
be
sued
wherever
he's
doing
business,
and
that's
incorporated
into
the
jones
act.
congress
gives
the
worker--
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
--no.
that's
a
venue
provision.
that's
allowed
venue
provision.
it's
not
a
limitation.
the
only
limitations
on
the
jurisdiction
are
this
court's
pronouncements
in
international
shoe
and
the
other
jurisdiction
cases.
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
yes,
but
if
this
case...
if
we
did
not
meet
the
jurisdiction
requirements,
american
dredging
could
have
got
out.
if
we
did
not
meet
the
venue
requirements
of
fela
as
enacted
through
jones
act,
they
would
also
have
gotten
out.
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
yes,
ma'am,
they
were
doing
business.
they
had
an
agent
for
service
of
process.
in
fact,
they
were
using
louisiana
courts
themselves
at
the
time
as
a
plaintiff.
mr.
timothy
j.
falcon
they
were
soliciting
business
through
the
american...
i'm
sorry,
through
the
corps
of
engineers
in
order
to
get
more
work.
to
answer...
american
dredging
company
puts
major
emphasis
that
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
is
a
uniform
and
characteristic
feature
of
the
admiralty
law.
if
we
look
at
the
history
of
the
admiralty
law,
in
footnote
5
of
the
moran
case,
which
was
decided
by
this
court,
it's
actually...
the
admiralty
law
itself
is
traced
to
civilian
doctrine.
the
admiralty
law
rose
through
civilian
law
such
as
france
and
louisiana,
and
as
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
said
in
the
miller
case,
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
is
actually
foreign
to
our
traditions,
so
it's
not
fair
to
say
that
forum
non
conveniens
came
from
admiralty,
because
the
doctrine
itself
was
foreign
to
the
actual
origin
of
admiralty,
and
to
trace...
and
as
justice
ginsburg
has
pointed
out,
it
was
first
recognized
in
a
nonmaritime
case.
american
dredging
company
has
also
tried
to
state
that
section
1404(a),
which
allows
the
transfer
of
a
fela
case,
is
applicable
to
this
case
and
is
the
reason
why
we
should...
why
the
supreme
court
should
be
overruled.
the
case
they're
referring
to
is
in
re
coal
air,
which
is
a
railroad
case,
that
distinguished
between
section
6
of
the
fela
action
dealing
with
the
broad
venue
provision
and
1404(a),
which
allowed
only
a
federal
court
to
transfer
a
case.
that
case
was
further
clarified
in
pope
v.
atlantic
coast
railroads,
where
the
court
said
that
the
fela
claim
that's
filed
in
state
court
still
cannot
be
dismissed
under
forum
non
conveniens
if
the
state
decided
not
to.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions--
