wasn't
the
first
time
that
this
court
enunciated
that
doctrine
and
recognized
it
was
not
in
admiralty,
it
was
in
a
diversity
case...
gulf
oil?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
concern
is
that
you're
constantly
associating
this
with
admiralty,
and
yet
as
far
as
i
know
it
was
part
of
equity,
and
it
was
also...
in
gulf
oil
it
was
a
straight
law
case
for
damages,
so
forum
non
conveniens
seems
to
me
across-the-board
doctrine
that
applies
in
cases
at
law,
equity,
and
in
admiralty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you're
saying
that
this
doctrine
must
mean
something
different
in
admiralty
than
it
does
in
other
areas,
because
what
do
you
do
with
mayfield,
where
the
court
made
it
clear
that
a
state
doesn't
have
to
copy
the
federal
position
on
forum
non
conveniens?
it
can
keep
the
case
if
it
wants
it,
and
it
can
dismiss
if
it
wants
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just
said
that
the
doctrine
is
the
same,
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
is
a
doctrine
that
cuts
across
the
law.
now
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
it's
different
in
admiralty
than
it
is
in
other
areas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
following
your
argument.
you've
already
recognized,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
that
forum
non
conveniens
does
not
emerge
in
the
common
law
world
for
the
first
time
in
the
context
of
admiralty,
and
it
is
a
doctrine
that
is
now
applied
across
the
board
to
cases
that
were
once
in
equity
at
law
in
admiralty,
but
now
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
this
doctrine
has
some
special
character
in
admiralty
cases
that
differs
it
from
its
shape
in
other
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
it
have
a
different
application
in
admiralty
than,
say,
under
the
fela,
which
is
a
federal
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
fela's
a
federal
statute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
it
has
to
be
interpreted
uniformly
by
the
federal
and
state
courts
that
apply
it,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
the
point
you're
making
about
1404(a).
if
this
case
were
brought
in...
let's
say
it
were
brought
in
the
federal
district
court
in
louisiana,
it's
admiralty
but
the
transfer
mechanism
would
be
1404(a),
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
that
respect
it's
not
different
from
the
fela.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
that
extent,
it's
the
same
as
the
fela,
and
it
doesn't
take
you
any
further
than
mayfield.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
one
part
of
what
the
jones
act
takes
from
the
fela,
if
a
plaintiff
brings
a
jones
act
case
in
the
state
court,
congress
has
declared
that
nonremovable,
right?
you
can't
remove
it
to
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right,
so
doesn't
that
cut
against
your
argument
that
the
congress
wanted
to
say,
"plaintiff,
you
have
a
right
to
stay
in
the
state
court,
but
state
court,
we're
going
to
make
you
conform
your
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
to
ours?
"
it's
something
that
seems
to
me
an
inconsistency
with
a
claim
that's
not
removable
from
the
state
court,
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
the
suitor
should
be
able
to
choose
the
forum,
and
then
say
to
the
forum,
state
forum,
but
you
have
to
make
yourself
over
to
look
more
like
what
a
federal
court
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
converting
discretionary
doctrine...
you
just
said
that
in
order
to
get
to
the
forum
non
conveniens
point,
you
must
have
personal
jurisdiction,
there
must
be
a
place
of
proper
venue,
so
the
court
is
vested
with
authority
to
proceed,
and
i
thought
that
the
whole
idea
of
forum
non
conveniens
was,
but
there
are...
but
it
isn't
a
compulsory
doctrine.
that
is,
although
we
have
authority
to
proceed,
we
ought
not,
because
there's
some
place
better
where
this
can
go
forward,
but
the
whole
doctrine
seems
to
be
just
infused
with
discretion
rather
than
compulsion,
which
is
what
you
seem
to
be
making
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
fair
in
the
sense
that
there's
a
basis
for
personal
jurisdiction
over
your
client
that
meets
the
due
process
requirement,
so
you
can't
say
that
there's
something
fundamentally
unfair
about
being
subject
to
suit
in
louisiana
when
you
have
in
effect
consented
to
suit
by
filing
in
that
state
by
registering.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
all
of
maritime
law.
i
think
in
louisiana
now
under
their
statute
it's
only
jones
act
claims
that
are--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
inconvenient
for
the
defendant,
not
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
falcon,
one
puzzling
piece
of
this
is
that
louisiana
now
has
a
general
forum
non
conveniens
provision,
and
it
exempts
jones
act
and
maritime.
you
would
think
if
the
concern
was
the
one
that
you
just
mentioned
they'd
put
the
fela
in
the
same
category,
because
that,
too,
is
a
nonremovable
federal
claim.
what
is
the
explanation
for
exempting
jones
act
and
maritime
law
claims
from
the
general
forum
non
conveniens
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
a
transfer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
not
the
fela.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
was
the
reason
for
distinguishing
these
two
claims
that
are
so
close
in
substance,
fela
and
jones
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
to
meet
a
venue
requirement
in
order
to
bring
a
jones
act
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
about
admiralty
peculiarly?
you
can
have
foreign
parties
in
a
diversity
case,
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
reserve
two
questions,
one
is
whether,
when
you're
in
a
state
court
but
the
defendants
are
from
abroad,
that
forum
non
conveniens
might
have
a
federal
flavor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for...
no
matter
what
the
character
of
the
case,
equity
law,
or
admiralty?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
make
of
the
nonremovability
of
these
claims,
because
if
the
federal...
if
congress
wanted
to
give
effect
to
the
federal
policy,
it
could
do
that
very
easily
simply
by
making
these
cases
removable
and
then
the
federal
court
could
apply
federal
forum
non
conveniens.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
a
question
on
what
you
meant
by
reciprocity.
you
said
considerations
of
reciprocity,
comity.
those
are
not
always
clear
words
that
would
figure
when
we're
dealing
with
a
foreign
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it's
a
jones
act
case,
then
we're
talking
about
u.s.
substantive
law
applying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
weren't
in
the
u.s.
interest,
if
this
were
a
totally
foreign
situation,
the
jones
act
wouldn't
apply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wagner,
you
would
have
no
case,
would
you,
if
this
plaintiff
came
from
mississippi
instead
of
louisiana?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
louisiana...
i'm
sorry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
all
about
the
distance
that
this
man
lives,
and
he
lives
inside
mississippi
instead
of
louisiana.
if
he
lived
across
the
border
you
would
have
no
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
that
changes
if
he
moved...
how
many
miles
would
he
have
to
move
to
be
inside
the
louisiana
borders?
