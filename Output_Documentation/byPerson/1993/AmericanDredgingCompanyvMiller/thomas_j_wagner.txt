mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
as
that
doctrine
has
been
articulated
in
the
admiralty
courts,
is
applicable
to
maritime
claims
when
filed
in
state
court
pursuant
to
the
28
u.s.c.
section
1333.
american
dredging,
the
petitioner,
asks
that
you
answer
that
question
in
the
affirmative
for
two
strong
reasons.
first,
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
doctrine
is
a
fundamental
and
an
important
feature
of
the
admiralty
law
which
should
be
respected
and
applied
uniformly
by
all
courts
in
all
situations,
regardless
of
whether
filed
in
state
or
federal
court,
regardless
of
the
citizenship,
nationality,
or
residence
of
the
parties.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
first
time
this
court
officially
recognized
that
doctrine
was
in
the
belgenland
case
in
1885,
where
it
recognized
that
the
court
could
dismiss
a
claim
in
dicta
for
the
same
reasons
as
forum
non
conveniens,
although
they
did
not
articulate
the
latin
phrase,
forum
non
conveniens.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
your
honor,
the
first
articulation
of
the
doctrine
using
the
term,
forum
non
conveniens,
did
appear
in
a
nonadmiralty
case,
but
that
case
draws
its
roots,
or
has
its
roots
exclusively
in
the
admiralty.
in
the
older
cases
of
1804,
where
chief
justice
story
referred
to
the
convenience
of
the
parties
as
being
able
to
be
considered,
and
whether
a
court
would
retain
jurisdiction
in
an
admiralty
salvage
case.
in
1885,
in
a
collision
case,
an
admiralty
collision
case,
the
court
recognized
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
in
weighing
the
various
factors
of
convenience,
of
nationality
of
citizenship
in
determining
whether
to
retain
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
your
honor,
i...
mr.
chief
justice,
we
agree
that...
with
that
principle,
that
is
now
a
doctrine,
whose
efficacy,
whose
utility
has
been
recognized
in
many
other
areas
of
law.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
the
first
consideration
of
it
that
i'm
aware
of
was
in
cases
in
scotland
which
were
not--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--maritime
cases,
that's
correct,
but
my
argument,
or
our
principle
here
is
that
the
admiralty
law
has
a
respected
position
by
virtue
of
the
constitution,
and
that
this
particular
doctrine,
albeit
with
some
roots
in
nonadmiralty,
is
a
fundamental
part
of
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
my--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--my
reference
is
that
the
rule
should
be
uniform,
but
the
interpretation
of
the
rule
is
always
subject
to
this
discretionary
input
of
the
trial
judge.
i
do
not
think--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--your
honor,
that's
our
position.
that's
our
position.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
justice
ginsburg,
my
response
with
reference
to
the
mayfield
decision,
which
was
the
1950
decision
of
this
court,
was
that
it
did
not
involve
any
of
the
constitutional
or
supremacy
issues
associated
with
the
general
maritime
law,
which
has--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--your
honor
i
may
be
misstating
myself.
i
may
not
be
making
myself
clear.
what
i'm
saying
is,
the
admiralty
doctrine
has
been
adopted
by
several
other
areas
of
law,
and
those
other
areas
of
law
are
free,
because
they
are
not
constricted,
by
the
uniformity
of
the
general
maritime
law,
to
change
and
apply
that
doctrine
in
different
fashions,
but
in
admiralty,
the
federal
courts,
and
this
court
in
particular,
is
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
what
the
uniform
rule
should
be.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
i
believe
that
it
does,
and
it
has
that
in
two
fashions,
1)
because
it
is
a
part
of
the
uniform
admiralty
law,
which
has
a
precedence,
it
has
a
supremacy
that
common
law
doesn't
necessarily
have,
and
secondly,
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
by
its
nature
extremely
broad,
extremely
vast.
it
touches
all
sorts
of
areas
of
law.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
well,
i
would
argue
that
the
first
reason
is
because
of
article
3,
section
2,
clause
1
of
the
constitution,
which
vests
this
court,
and
vests
the
national
courts
with
jurisdiction
over
all
admiralty
and
maritime
cases,
and
the
cases
that
are
interpreted
that
have
all
recognized
that
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
and
the
function
of
all
courts
to
apply
a
uniform
general
maritime
law,
and
that
has
a
standing
that
the
fela
does
not
have.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
but
forum
non
conveniens
is
not
part
of
the
fela,
whereas
forum
non
conveniens
is
an
integral
part
of
the
general
maritime
law,
and
i
might
assert
one
other
thing.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
focus
on
the
language
of
the
jones
act
in
adopting...
in
adopting
the
standard
of
the
fela.
i'm
referring
to
the...
just
quoting
from
the
jones
act
as
quoted
in
the
appendix
of
the
solicitor's
brief.
it
says,
"any
seaman
who
shall
suffer
personal
injury
in
the
course
of
his
employment
may,
at
his
election,
maintain
an
action
for
damages
at
law
with
a
right
of
trial
by
jury,
and
in
such
action,
all
statutes
of
the
united
states
modifying,
or
extending,
the
common
law
right
or
remedy
in
cases
of
personal
injury
to
railway
employees
shall
apply.
"
one
of
those
statutes
which
extends
and
modifies
the
right
of
railway
workers
is
section
1404
of
the
judicial
code,
which
is
a
federal
transfer
statute,
which
was
passed
explicitly
by
congress
to
provide
that
fela
cases
would
be
transferable
under
the
same
standards
that
had
been
judicially
established
under
forum
non
conveniens.
missouri
v.
mayfield
did
not
address
that
issue,
it
did
not
need
to
address
that
issue,
because
it
was
not
a
jones
act
case.
the
jones
act
is
a
part
of
the
admiralty
law,
and
forum
non
conveniens
as
a
part
of
the
admiralty
law
are
fused
and
form
part
of
the
uniform
law.
it
should
be
applicable--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--unless
it
was
to
be
transferred
internationally,
your
honor,
in
which
event
forum
non
conveniens--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--well,
it...
what
i'm
trying
to
express
is
that
there
is
a
dual
basis
for
the
uniform
application
of
this
doctrine.
one
is
as
a
part
of
the
general
maritime
law,
and
the
second
is
through
the
express...
express
text
of
congress
in
the
jones
act
in
applying
all
statutes
that
modify
fela
remedies,
and
indeed,
that
is
exactly--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--except
that
mayfield
did
not
concern
itself
1)
with
the
jones
act,
and
2)
with
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states.
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--the
interpretation
of
this
court
in
the
romero
decision
is
that
such
a
claim
is
nonremovable.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
yes,
your
honor,
we
think
that's
a
very
important
distinction,
is
that
the
nonremovability
of
the
jones
act
is
something
that
is
recognized,
but
this
is
not
affected
by
the
ability
to
transfer
this
action
from
one
jurisdiction
to
another,
and
in
fact
romero
makes
very
explicit
that
while
causes
of
action
in
state
court
may
be
maintained
under
the
"savings
to
suitors"
clause,
there
is
an
overriding
obligation
of
the
state
court
to
do
the
work
of
admiralty,
to
be
in
admiralty
court,
to
apply
the
uniform
general
maritime
law
even
though
the
defendant
cannot
remove
that...
cannot
otherwise
remove
the
action
that
is
otherwise
removable.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
they
would
dismiss
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
subject
to
certain
guarantees
protecting
the
plaintiff's
right
to
proceed,
and
that's
in
fact
what
the
district
court
did
do
after
finding
that
louisiana
was
a
patently
inconvenient
forum,
and
was
forum-shopping
of
the
worst
sort.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
well,
your
honor,
by
analogy,
and
that's
all
i
can
answer,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
by
analogy,
is
that
between
the
jurisdictions
within
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
state
court
could
transfer.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
that's
right,
mr.
chief--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--your
honor,
i
do
at
this
juncture.
we
disputed
that
at
the
trial
court
and
lost
it.
i
have
personal
views
about
that,
but
we
have
conceded
that
point,
and
in
fact,
as
a
matter
of
general
maritime
law,
forum
non
conveniens
does
not
arise
unless
there
is
the
existence
of
personal
jurisdiction,
the
very
minimum
contacts
justice
o'connor
referred
to,
and
proper
venue.
we
concede
those
points
for
the
sake
of
this
argument.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
your
honor,
i...
i
want
its
application.
we
request
that
its
application
be
compulsory,
but
the
doctrine
itself,
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
doctrine,
the
issue,
the
aspect
of
the
doctrine
that
makes
it
so
valuable,
is
its
discretionary
function
in
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
is
able
to
weigh
the
various
factors
articulated
by
this
court
and
determine
what
is
a
fair
forum
for
these
litigants
to
try
the
cases,
and
the
aspect
of
its
discretionary
function
is
why
it
serves
the
admiralty,
and
by
that
i
mean,
plaintiffs
and
defendants.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
justice
scalia,
i
agree
with
your
point,
and
i
think
it
demonstrates
i'm
not
being
clear.
i'm
not...
we
are
not
requesting
uniformity
of
result.
that
can't
be
done.
what--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--you
can
never
be
sure
you
get
the
same
results
in
any
trial.
what
we're
asking
is
uniformity
of
the
rule.
we're
asking
for
the
uniform
application
of
the
doctrine,
just
like
we
take
a
set
of
facts
and
we
give
them
to
one
trier
of
fact
and
ask,
is
there
fault,
is
there
causation?
i
cannot
be
sure
what
the
answer
will
be,
but
what
i
can
be
sure
of
is
the
doctrine
that
defines
what
fault
is,
and
that's
what
we're
asking.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
that's
right.
we're
asking
for
a
rule
that
is
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
overturnable
by
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
your
honor,
i--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--i
respectfully
disagree
that
it
doesn't
shape
the
conduct
of
the
parties.
once
you
have
infused
the
admiralty
law
with
this
type
of
disunity,
this
type
of
dissonance,
then
you
invite
litigants
to
race
to
the
favorable
courthouse,
which
may
or
may
not
have
this
rule,
which
may
or
may
not
have
other
state
rules,
which
may
be
friendly
or
may
not
be
friendly,
without
regard
to
what
is
a
fair
forum,
and
so
what...
and
i've
cited
it
in
our
petition
asking
for
cert--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--we
agree
that
it
satisfies
due
process
requirements
for
the
sake
of
personal
jurisdiction.
our
point
here
is
that
if
you
don't
have
uniform
rule
in
admiralty
that
invites
the
court,
that
directs
the
court
to
consider
what
is
a
fair
forum,
while
one
plaintiff
is
resorting
to
filing
in
louisiana,
one
insurer
is
filing
a
direct
action
statute
in
pennsylvania,
one
employer
is
filing
a
direct...
i'm
sorry,
a
declaratory
judgment
in
pennsylvania
and
the
employer
is
filing
an
action
here.
you're
asking
for
the
parties
to
race
for
the
courthouse
which
will
give
it
the
best
deal
because
you
have
not
instilled
in
the
trier
of
fact
the
ability
to
say,
the
fair
forum
for
the
case
is,
in
this
instance,
pennsylvania,
without
regard
to
who's
got
the
best
law,
without
regard
to
whether
it's
an
american
or
non-american
who
has
filed
the
claim.
it's
a
fundamental
rule
of
fairness
that
where
should
these
maritime
litigants...
i
think
that
the
point
made
by
justice
jackson
in
the
lauritsen
case
speaks
well
to
this.
if
we
let
every
jurisdiction
which
has
any
contact,
or
sufficient
constitutional
contact
with
a
maritime
litigant
to
exercise
its
full
breadth
of
authority,
the
overlapping,
duplicative
burdens
that
will
exist
upon
maritime
actors
will
totally,
totally
surround
and
disrupt
the
ability
to
have
effective
maritime
commerce.
it
is
for
this
reason,
i...
we
respectfully
submit,
that
the
admiralty
law,
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction,
is
the
one
substantive
area
of
jurisdiction
recognized
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
i
think
different
considerations
enter
into
the
trial
judge's
weighing
of
its
discretion
depending
upon
the
nationality
of
the
parties,
their
residence,
but
i
think
the
formula's
the
same.
in
fact,
the
louisiana
rule
is
not
restricted
in
its
focus
on
american
or
non-american
claimants,
and
it's
not
restricted
to
personal
injury
claimants.
forum
non
conveniens
has
been
a
part
of
the
admiralty
law
in
every
area...
salvage,
collision,
personal
injury,
product
liability,
marine
insurance,
maritime
leads.
the
louisiana
rule
would
discard
all
of
that.
get
jurisdiction,
and
let
the
state
exercise
its
jurisdiction
to
the
full
breadth
of
its
authority
without
regard
to
its
impact
on
maritime
commerce.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
detrimental
to
the
constitutional
underpinnings
of
a
system--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--no,
your
honor,
it
applies
to--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--jones
act
and
maritime
law.
texas
has
recently
amended
its
statute,
but
it's
unclear
whether
it's
affecting
maritime
law
or
not.
our
ultimate
position
is,
the
unfettered
extension
of
jurisdiction
without
this
discretionary
authority
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court,
expressed
i
think
most
ably
by
judge
federoff,
by
the
trial
judge,
this
forum
is
totally
inconvenient,
and
represents
forum
shopping
of
the
worst
sort.
it
was
only
through
his
ability
to
decide
the
case,
an
admiralty
case,
that
he
could
direct
this
case
into
a
fair
forum.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
ah,
but
the
plaintiff
took
the
position...
the
plaintiff
took
the
position
that
i
could
have
filed
in
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
could
have
filed
in
mississippi,
but
i
have
an
unfettered
right
to
go
where
i
want
to
go.
the
plaintiff,
the
mississippi
resident,
files
in
louisiana.
so
it's
hard
to
argue
that
this
is
a
decision
based
upon
convenience,
and
the
plaintiff
never
challenged
in
the
trial
court,
never
challenged
at
that
level
at
least,
the
fact
that
this
was
patently
inconvenient.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
concede
that.
the
plaintiff
has
said
that
in
a
footnote
in
his
brief.
that
was
not
raised
at
the
trial
court
level,
and--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
if
i
might,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
address
a
number
of
the
points
that
were
raised,
but
i
don't
think
any
one
is
more
important
than
the
question
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
different
rule
for
one
set
of
litigants
as
for
another
set.
i
think
the
whole
concept
of
a
uniform
general
maritime
law
grows
out
of
the
recognition
that
in
order
to
promote
maritime
commerce
a
single,
expected
system
should
be
identified.
to
take
this
rule
of
forum
non
conveniens
that
the
lower
courts
have
consistently
applied
to
both
national
claimants
and
local
claimants
and
international
claimants
and
fragment
it,
and
say,
well,
mr.
plaintiff
from
bermuda,
you
can
have
a
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine,
or
mr.
defendant
from
america,
you
can
or
you
cannot,
is
to
harken
back
to
the
very
kind
of
dichotomy,
the
very
kind
of
local
protectionism,
that
i
submit
was
the
reason
the
admiralty
law
was
recognized--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--if
he
came
from
louisiana
instead
of
mississippi?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
have
no
case
whatsoever,
and
that's
exactly
my
point.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
i
would
have
no
case,
but
i
respectfully
disagree
that
it's
just
about
that.
it's
about
what's
a
fundamentally
fair
way
to
try
a
dispute
between
the
parties
without
inviting
the
parties
to
have--
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
--maybe
60
miles,
your
honor,
but
the
whole
point...
what
changes,
your
honor,
is
we
have
taken
away
the
power
of
the
trial
judge
to
decide
what's
fair
and
what's
not
fair.
in
this
very
same
court,
the
civil
district
court
for
the
parish
of
orleans,
in
markozannes
v.
bermuda
starline,
applying
this
very
same
statute,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
held
that
the
trial
court
must
hear
a
case,
a
jones
act
case,
by
a
greek
seaman
sailing
a
panamanian
vessel
between
bermuda
and
boston.
so
it's
not
merely
the
distance,
your
honor.
i
respectfully
submit
it
is
the
power
of
the
trial
judge
to
decide
what's
fair,
what's
proper.
once
you
take
away
that
power,
you
create
all
sorts
of
possibilities
of
extensive
forum
shopping
and
vexatious
litigation.
mr.
thomas
j.
wagner
there's
something
terribly
wrong
in
principle
with
that,
and
that
is,
it's
the
anathema
of
the
general
maritime
law,
and
how
do
we
divide
that?
does
the
american
defendant
get
the
nod
over
the
foreign
plaintiff?
does
the
american
plaintiff
get
the
nod
over
the
foreign
defendant,
and
how
foreign?
do
we
then
dissect
this?
the
whole
beauty...
beauty,
the
mastery
of
forum
non
conveniens
is,
is
that
it
is
discretionary.
it
puts
in
the
power
of
the
trial
judge,
the
person
who
will
have
to
decide
what's
convenient.
in
markozannes
we
had
doctors
testifying
from
greece
by
phone.
the
whole
point
of
this
is,
that
trial
judge
who
faces
these
very
critical
issues
of
what's
fair
and
is
not
fair
is
able
to
say,
this
case
is
in
a
patently
inconvenient
forum,
and
like
the
federal
system
i
will
dismiss
this
conditioned
upon,
mr.
defendant,
you
not
raising
procedural
or
limitation
objections
and
going
forward
in
the
proper
forum
of
pennsylvania.
that's
the
mastery,
that
is
the
effectiveness
of
this
tool.
it
complements
this
broad,
broad
breadth
of
admiralty
jurisdiction,
whether
it
be
obtained
in
rem,
whether
it
be
by
writ
of
foreign
attachment,
whether
it's
salvage
or
personal
injury,
it
puts
in
the
hands
of
the
trial
judge
the
ability,
discretionary,
to
say,
this
is
a
fair
forum.
it
accords
the
plaintiff
an
appropriate
deference
to
his
or
her
original
selection.
that
is
entitled
to
great
weight,
and
it
ensures...
it
ensures
that
the
alternate
forum
will
have
a
suitable
remedy,
and
then
it
weighs
the
questions
of
what's
a
convenient
way
to
try
this
case,
the
convenience
of
the
parties,
the
witnesses.
in
fact,
i
need
to
make
this
fundamental
point
clear.
in
admiralty,
this
has
never
been
a
question
of
what
the
solicitor
general
has
called
judicial
housekeeping,
or
docket
control.
that's
handy
in
a
nonmarine
setting,
but
in
admiralty,
it
services
the
broad
breadth
of
that
jurisdiction,
makes
it
effective,
and
makes
it
fair,
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
on
that
basis
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
