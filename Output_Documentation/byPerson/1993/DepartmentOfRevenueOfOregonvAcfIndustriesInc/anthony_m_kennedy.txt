but
if
it
doesn't
reach
that
far,
if
the
and
other
language
is
qualified,
and
if
it's
qualified
in
terms
of
the
statute,
then
doesn't
that
mean
that
it's
plausible
that
another
tax
means
a
property
tax
that
is
equalized
so
far
as
assessment
and
rate
but
has
differential
exemptions?
the
minute
you
say
another...
the
point
of
the
question
was
the
minute
you
say
that
another
tax
is
more
narrow
than
the
language
would
suggest
and
it's
qualified
by
the
rest
of
the
act,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
proposal
of
the
railroads
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
that
every
state
has
some
exemptions.
tell
me,
what
is
the
pattern
so
far
as
equalization?
do
most
states
have
different
classifications
of
property
so
far
as
both
assessment
and
rate,
or
is
that
unusual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
was
to
put
personal
property
tax
and
real
property
tax
in
different
categories
for
purposes
of
the
comparison?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
that
is
a
correct
methodology?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
personal
and
real
property
should
be
lumped
together
in
one
category?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
relief
that
the
court
ordered
in
the
case
was
that
you
would
simply
get
a
67
percent
credit?
would
that
eliminate
the
discrimination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
put,
under
the
formula
where
you
get
a
67
percent
credit,
you
are
put
in
the
same
position
as
all
other
taxpayers
in
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then
if
the
50
percent
threshold
is
reached
you
do
get
a
most
favored
nation
type
treatment.

oregon
imposes
an
ad
valorem
tax
upon
all
real
and
personal
property
within
its
jurisdiction
except
property
granted
an
express
exception
and
there
are
various
classes
of
business
personal
property
that
are
exempt.
the
respondents
in
these
case
are
called
the
carlines
and
there
are
eight
companies
at
least
railroad
cars
to
railroad
and
shippers.
now,
the
railroad
cars
are
not
exempt
in
taxation
in
oregon
and
the
carlines
brought
claim
that
this
differential
exemption
scheme
voilates
the
federal
statute
and
that
statute
prohibits
certain
taxes
against
railroad
property.
it
is
called
the
railroad
revitalization
and
regulatory
reform
act
of
1976,
otherwise
known
as
the
4-r
act.
the
question
presented
is
whether
congress
violated
the
4-r
act
by
imposing
an
ad
valorem
tax
upon
railroad
property
while
exempting
various
other
but
not
all
classes
of
commercial
and
industrial
property.
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
of
some
14
pages
now
we
attempt
in
detial
to
examine
the
structure
and
the
wording
to
the
statute
to
resolve
the
issue
presented.
now,
that
analysis
would
be
somewhat
insidious
to
explain
on
the
bench
even
in
a
brief
statement.
suffice
it
to
say
that
our
holding
rejects
the
challenge
to
the
taxation
scheme.
the
exemptions
oregon
granted
did
not
discriminate
its
railroad
property
within
the
meaning
relevant
statutory
sections.
we
are
confident
that
had
congress
to
limit.
the
power
of
the
state
to
exempt
non-railroad
property
from
a
general
property
tax
scheme
it
would
have
spoken
with
precision
and
clarity
in
order
to
do
so.
we
do
not
find
that
intent
to
the
stature.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
justine
steven
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
