mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
stipulation
in
this
case,
oregon
fully
taxes
the
personal
property
of
every
carline
and
railroad
that
does
business
in
the
state,
while
at
the
same
time
oregon
exempts
from
personal
property
taxes
more
than
67
percent
of
the
personal
business
property
in
that
state.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
only
in
the
context
of
the
stipulation,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
stipulation
says
they
fully
tax
to
the
full
extent.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
there
is
under-assessment
and
under-reporting.
the
railroads
do
not
receive
the
benefits
of
that.
the
role
of
under-assessing
and
under-reporting
in
this
case,
however,
is
not
significant
because
with
or
without
that
particular
component
we
find
that
there
is
a
majority
discrimination
in
any
event.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court
at
this
particular
point.
in
our
view
oregon
unquestionably
treats
the
railroad
property
worse
than
it
treats
the
majority
of
the
other
property
within
the
state,
and
accordingly
respondents
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
oregon
imposes
a
tax
that
results
in
discriminatory
treatment
against
rail
carriers
as
that
language
appeared
in
the
original
version
of
what
is
now
49
u.s.c.
section
11503(b)(4),
and
therefore
the
tax
is
unlawful.
in
turn
respondents
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
the
only
appropriate
remedy
for
that
situation
is
to
enjoin
the
state
from
imposing
that
personal
property
tax
and
thereby
treat
the
railroad
property
just
as
it
treats
the
majority
of
other
property
within
the
state.
in
doing
that
there
are
essentially
three
issues
in
this
case,
although
at
this
stage
you
might
have
lost
sight
of
a
couple
of
them
because
the
state
for
its
part
focuses
almost
exclusively
on
the
threshold
question
of
whether
or
not
(b)(4)
applies
to
anything
at
all,
almost
in
some
respects,
but
certainly
it
raises
the
question
of
whether
(b)(4)
applies
to
ad
valorem
taxes
and
whether
it
challenges
its
exemption
practices
in
this
case.
the
second--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
that
issue
have
permitted
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
not
originally
taken
the
position
that
there
is
no
relief
to
be
had
for
exemptions
under
(b)(1)
through
(b)(3)
we
might
have
pressed
that
argument.
we
certainly
have
done
so
in
the
past.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
what
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--not
if
you
put
it
in
the
context
of
the
precise
language
of
(b)(4).
(b)(4)
says
in
the
original
language
that
it
prohibits
any
other
tax
that
results
in
discrimination.
that
is
extraordinarily
broad
language,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
understand
that,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it
has
to
mean
the
exact
same
as
any
other
tax
because
the
change
is
not
to
have
any
substantive
effect,
but
the
actual
language
adopted
by
congress
is
actually
any
other
tax
and
that's
the
language
that
ought
to
control
in
terms
of
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
comes
from
the
original
language
as
well,
justice,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
to
the
extent
that
it
means
something
different
from
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
apply
the
any
other
tax
language
because
that's
what
this
court
said
in
burlington
northern
and
that's
what
congress
said
it
wanted
to
have
happen.
but
this
recodification
was
not
to
implement
any
substantive
changes
in
the
way
the
statute
ought
to
be
applied,
and
therefore
the
extraordinarily
expansive
language
of
(b)(4)
as
originally
enacted
in
the
1976
4r
act
is
the
language
that
should
guide
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
that
provision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
that
is
what
congress
indicated
when
it
allowed
the
recodification
in
1978.
it
made
it
very
clear
that
that
recodification
was
not
to
change
the
substantive
sweep
of
any
of
the
language
implemented
through
that
recodification
process.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
most
natural
reading
of
that
language
is
to
refer
to
any
other
tax
that
discriminates.
what
we're
talking
about
are
other
means,
or
means
of
discrimination
in
the
first
two
provisions,
and
the
language
at
the
end
both
deals
with
additional
discriminations
and
also
deals
more
broadly
than
the
earlier
taxes.
they
don't
talk
strictly
about
property
or
forms
of
property
or
railroad
property.
they
deal
much
more
broadly
with
the
question
of
discriminatory
treatment
of
rail
carriers.
and
therefore
that
language,
as
the
solicitor
general
argues
in
his
brief
and
with
which
we
agree
completely,
encompasses
a
much
broader
prohibition
on
discriminations
than
any
of
the
other
language.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
except
that
(1)
through
(3)
identify
precise
definitions
of
objectively
identifiable
discriminations
that
the
statute
prohibits.
the
language
results
in
discriminatory
treatment
doesn't
self-define.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that's
the
most
natural
way
to
understand
the
particular
language
that
congress
chose
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
would
have
understood
the
way
you
argued
that,
justice
souther,
for
exactly
the
opposite
proposition,
which
is
that
it
clearly
must
mean
that
the
state
is
not
in
a
position
where
it
can
sit
back
and
exempt
all
of
the
other
property
of
the
state,
leaving
only
the
railroads
out
there
exposed
to
discrimination,
and
find
a
way
to
argue
that
that's
nevertheless
not
a
treatment
that
results
in
discrimination
against
the
railroads.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
sure
that's
true
as
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
at
least
an
odd
approach
to
the
language
of
the
statute
to
guarantee
that
it
will
be
self-defeating.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
interesting
in
that
regard
because
the
states
historically
have
now
taken
diametrically
opposed
views
of
what
this
language
means
precisely.
on
the
one
hand
when
they
have
non-ad
valorem
taxes
they
tell
you
that
it
only
applies
to
ad
valorem
taxes,
and
when
they
have
ad
valorem
taxes
they
tell
you
it
applies
to
every
other
tax
except
ad
valorem
taxes.
and
presumably
if
you
were
interpreting
this
with
reference
to
the
canon
of
construction
under
the
anti-injunction
act,
both
of
those
positions
would
be
equally
supported
in
exactly
the
same
way.
it
seems
to
me
the
language
is
not
so
very
plain
on
either
side
that
you
can
tell
what
congress
precisely
meant,
but
what
you
can
tell
is
what
congress'
objective
was
here
which
was
to
avoid
allowing
railroads
to
be
treated
more
harshly
than
the
majority
of
other
property
within
the
state.
and
when
you
take
that
view,
and
to
adopt
a
view
that
guarantees
that
the
state,
excuse
me,
that
the
railroads
will
have
majority
support,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
only
way
you
can
do
that
is
to
find
that
(b)(4)'s
very
broad
language
is
expansive
enough
to
permit
the
interpretation
that
the
railroads
propose
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
addressed
this
issue--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no,
i
have
some
difficulty
with
that,
justice
souter,
because
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
addressed
this
issue,
has
read
that
language,
has
inferred
from
that
language
that
it
is
a
catch-all
provision
and
that
it
really
means
any
additional
taxes
that
discrimination
over
and
above
the
ones
that
are
objectively
identified
in
(b)(1)
through
(b)(3).
and
so
i
find
it
at
least
presumptuous
of
me
to
suggest
that
that's
not
a
very
natural
and
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
language
because
there
are
a
whole
host
of
very
talented
jurists
who
have
reached
that
exact
conclusion,
indeed
all
of
them
have.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
not
the
position
of
the
carlines
in
this
case.
our
position
on
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
term
discrimination
or
discriminatory
treatment
has
been,
is
the
same
here
as
it
has
been
all
along,
which
is
that
you
must
make
the
proper
comparison
between
personal
and
personal
properties
and
that
exemption
of
more
than
50
percent
of
the
personal
property
is
a
triggering
point.
and
once
the
state
exempts
more
than
50
percent
of
other
business'
personal
property,
other
commercial
and
industrial
property,
then
you
have
discrimination
that
is
per
se
invalid
under
(b)(4)
and
ought
to
be
set
aside.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
have
no
trouble
with
66-2/3.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
the
exact
same
number,
justice
scalia,
that
congress
would
have
you
pluck
out
of
the
air
in
applying
the
(b)(3)
provision,
because
if
you
have
50
percent
of
the
personal
property
taxed
at
one
rate,
or
let's
say
50
plus
a
little,
and
49
percent
taxed
another
rate,
the
statute
requires
that
the
railroad
property
be
taxed
at
the
lower
rate,
or
whatever
the
majority
rate
is.
it
could
be
favorable
or
unfavorable,
but
that
50
percent
majority
line
is
inherent
in
(b)(3)
and
makes
sense
in
(b)(4).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there
is
no
textual
basis
for
that,
justice
scalia.
there
is
a
textual
basis
for
the
(b)(1)
through
(b)(3)--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--except
that
the
comparison
is
that
there's
no
language
of
discriminate
that
comes
out
of
(b)(1)
through
(b)(3),
first
of
all,
and
second
of
all--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
(b)(4)
also
exemplifies
the
discrimination.
i
mean,
it
implements
the
discrimination.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
except
that
the
purpose
of
it
is
not
to
make
comparisons
to
property.
(b)(1)
through
(b)(3)
makes
specific
property
types
of
comparisons.
(b)(4)
protects
a
broader
class.
it
protects
rail
carriers.
and
therefore
that
language
doesn't
necessarily
take
you
back
up
to
the
discrimination
language
of
the
preamble,
and
it
ought
to
be
given
the
full
effect.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
difficulty
i
have
with
your
argument,
justice
souter,
is
you
still
are
dealing...
i
don't
see
how
you
get
to
the
point
where
you
say
i
can
take
all
of
the
property
of
the
state
out
of
the
personal
property
tax
base
except
the
railroads,
and
that's
not
a
tax
that
results
in
discrimination
against
the
railroads,
against
the
rail
carriers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
have
two
thoughts
about
that.
first
of
all,
the
use
of
the
term
discriminate
in
the
preamble
talks
about
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce,
whereas
the
term
discriminate
in
subsection
(b)(4)
talks
about
discrimination
against
rail
carriers.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
fair
to
infer
that
those
necessarily
reincorporate
each
other,
and
it's
an
odd
phraseology.
and
again,
i
think
if
you
take
the
(b)(1)
through
(b)(3)
and
too
narrow
constrain
them,
what
you
do
is
violence
to
the
language
differences
between
(b)(1)
and
(b)(3),
and
(b)(4).
the
specific
exemptions
provide
that
they
are
taking
out
exemptions
for
making
assessment
ratio
decisions,
and
they
are
taking
out
exemptions
from
trying
to
make
rate
judgments.
that
makes
perfect
sense
if
anybody
has
ever
tried
to
do
a
ratio
assessment,
an
assessment
ratio
analysis,
because
it's
very
hard
to
figure
out
how
you're
going
to
assess
property
that
has
never
been
taxed.
so
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
take
it
out
of
that
context.
it's
a
much
more
streamlined
and
sensible
way
of
implementing
the
tax
scheme,
but
that's
not
a
reason
then
to
go
and
take
away
from
(b)(4)
the
language
that
every
court
of
appeals
has
embraced
and
said
is
a
catch-all
prohibition
against
all
forms
of
discrimination.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
view
the
"other"
as
referring
to
other
forms
of
discrimination,
so
that
it's
any
other
tax
that
discriminates.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
that,
coupled
with
the
overall
language
in
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
was
to
provide
a
generalized
protection
against
unfair
treatment
to
the
railroads
to
insure
their
financial
stability
and
viability.
now,
assuming
that
the
(b)(4)
exemption
applies
to
the
particular
taxes
here
and
that
the
exemption
scheme
that
the
state
has
adopted
is
subject
to
scrutiny
on
the
standards
of
discrimination,
we
then
come
to
the
question
of
on
what
basis
do
you
decide
that
there
has
been
discrimination
in
this
case.
the
position
of
the
carlines,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
has
remained
steadfast,
that
the
appropriate
comparison
is
between
personal
property
and
personal
property,
and
real
property
and
real
property.
the
state
defines
those
terms
differently,
the
state
applies
its
exemption
policies
differently,
and
as
a
consequence
of
that
it
is
a
legitimate
position
for
the
carlines
to
take
that
those
comparisons
ought
to
be
made
in
the
context
of
the
specific
case.
under
the
stipulation
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
agreed
to
by
both
parties,
there
is
no
doubt
that
67
percent
of
the
property
other
than
the
railroad's
property
in
the
state
of
oregon
is
exempt
completely
from
taxation
while
33
percent
of
the
property
remains
fully
taxed,
as
is
the
railroad
property
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
our
position
is
that
does
not
eliminate
the
discrimination,
justice
kennedy.
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
our
remedy
flows
directly
from
the
nature
of
the
violation.
if
you
treat
us
worse
than
a
majority
of
the
taxpayers
of
the
state,
of
the
property
holders
of
the
state,
then
the
appropriate
remedy
that
flows
from
that,
given
that
it's
a
statute
that
prohibits
imposing
taxes
in
a
particular
way,
is
that
we
be
treated
precisely
as
the
majority
is
treated.
and
in
this
case
67
percent
of
the
taxpayers,
the
tax
base,
is
exempt
from
taxation
and
therefore
we
should
be
exempt
from
taxation
as
well.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
technically
you're
certainly
not,
because
what
you've
done
is
you
have
created
three
different
categories
of
taxation.
you've
got
exempt
tax,
you've
got
fully
taxed,
and
you've
got
railroad
taxed,
and
that
seems
to
me
an
extraordinary
remedy
for
a
court
to
order.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
provides
for
that
kind
of
relief,
and
it
seems
to
us
the
more
appropriate
course
to
take
under
those
circumstances
is
simply
to
place
us
in
the
position
we
would
have
been
if
the
state
had
treated
us
as
well
as
it
does
the
majority
of
the
other
taxpayers
in
the
state.
in
that
event
we
would
be
fully
exempt
from
taxation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
because
that's
the
only
way
to
insure
that
we
consistently
are
treated
like
the
majority
of
the
other
property,
which
we
think
was
a
significant
value
that
undergirds
the
statute.
the
state
did
not
disagree
with
that
in
its
assessment.
it
concedes
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
4r
act
in
section
3061(d)
was
to
insure
that
the
fate
of
the
railroads
as
taxpayers
would
be
tied
or
bound
up
with
the
fate
of
the
broader
group
of
taxpayers
in
the
state.
as
a
consequence
of
that,
that
remedy
flows
directly
from
the
particular
violation
that
we
assert
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not
exactly
sure
how
the
numbers
would
play
out.
mr.

there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
that
is
not
the
approach
that
has
ever
been
taken
with
respect
to
(b)(1)
and
(b)(3).
under
those
provisions
it
is
never
available
to
the
railroad
to
argue
that
the
differentials
in
rates
for
personal
property
should
be
compared
to
real
property
as
a
basis
for
seeking
some
kind
of
relief.
and
it
seems
to
us
if
you
don't
compare
it
for
(b)(3)
there
is
really
no
reason
to
compare
it
for
(b)(4).
second
of
all,
it
is
wholly
arbitrary
to
decide
that
you're
going
to
make
a
comparison
with
respect
to
real
property
but
then
you're
going
to
exclude
all
intangible
personal
property.
and
the
stipulation
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
$60
billion
worth
of
intangible
personal
property
in
the
state
of
oregon,
all
of
which
is
exempt,
so
that
if
you
were
to
include
that
into
the
mix
you
would
end
up
with
something
akin,
under
the
state's
reply
brief
analysis
of
all
the
property
things,
you'd
end
up
with
an
89
percent
exemption
of
property
while
we're
getting
taxed
fully.
under
those
circumstances
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
would
be
invalid.
but
we
have
never
argued,
none
of
the
railroads
nor
the
carlines
have
ever
insisted
on
that
kind
of
a
comparison.
what
we
ask
for
is
to
be
treated
like
the
property
holders
who
are
most
comparable
to
us,
business
and
commercial
industries.
that
is
all
we
have
asked
for,
and
it
seems
reasonable
to
us.
one
last
observation
i
would
make
with
respect
to
the
government's
justifications
argument,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
justifications
are
not
provided
for
for
(b)(1)
and
(b)(3),
and
no
reason
appears
under
our
theory
of
a
majority
rule
to
have
justifications
applied
for
(b)(4).
and
in
any
event
it
is
absolutely
clear
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
justification
within
the
meaning
of
the
government's
position
that
would
justify--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
other
hand
we're
not
talking
about
every
disparity
giving
rise
to
discrimination.
under
our
theory
of
it,
when
you
get
above
50
percent
you
have
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
should
not
warrant
an
additional
justifications
argument.
i
guess
i
would
just
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
sort
of
basic
point
here
which
is
that
to
incorporate
that
kind
of
a
justifications
analysis
is
to
take
what
we
think
is
a
relatively
straightforward
and
simple
analysis
and
make
it
an
extraordinarily
complex
and
difficult
problem
for
the
lower
courts,
and
we
see
no
reason
to
commend
that
approach.
since
the
court
of
appeals
enjoined
properly
the
tax
in
this
case,
it's
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
