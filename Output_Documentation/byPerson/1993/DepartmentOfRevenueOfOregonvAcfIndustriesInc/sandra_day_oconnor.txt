now,
ms.
linder,
we
are
concerned
here
only
with
subsection
(4),
is
that
correct?
that's
the
only
issue
before
us,
the
meaning
of
that
subsection
(4)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
and
it
says
that
a
state
may
not
impose
another
tax
that
discriminates
against
rail
carrier.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
now,
what
other
tax
does
that
mean?
i
mean,
what's
the
meaning
of
that?
is
that
other
than
an
ad
valorem
property
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
how
you
read
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
would
cover
sales
taxes
and
gross
receipts
taxes
and
income
taxes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes?
under
your
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
if
it
means
any
other
tax
other
than
ad
valorem,
why
doesn't
it
pick
up
all
those
other
taxes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
agree
that
the
plain
language
would
suggest
it
would
cover
all
these
other
taxes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
there
was
certainly
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
gross
receipts
taxes
and
so
forth
were
in
the
minds
of
the
drafters
of
that
provision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
language
would
certainly
reach
sales
and
income
and
other
taxes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it
did
then
how
do
you
view
the
discrimination?
no
exemptions
allowed
for
these
other
taxes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
that
that
hypothetical
tax
would
not
violate
subsections
(1)
through
(3)
because
of
the
definition
that
allows
exemptions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
typical
that
all
states
have
personal
property
taxes
on
commercial
and
industrial
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
typical
that
these
schemes
have
exemptions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
include
disparate
impact?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
certainly
can't
rebut
it
if
it
falls
under
(1)
through
(3).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
compare
it
to?
to
get
under
(4),
to
find
discrimination
you
have
to
compare
a
with
b.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
it
you're
comparing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
the
railroads
point
out,
the
property,
the
motor
vehicle
tax
may
be
$10
a
vehicle,
which
is
hardly
comparable
to
the
kind
of
tax
rates
that
is
imposed
on
the
property
tax
generally.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
in
applying
subsections
1
through
3
we
look
to
the
definition,
do
we,
of
commercial
and
industrial
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
phrase
subject
to
a
property
tax
levy
means
that
under
(1)
through
(3)
the
state
can
have
an
exemption
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
why
your
clients
did
not
bring
their
cause
of
action
under
(1)
through
(3)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
is
a
bit
odd,
then,
when
you
come
to
(b)(4)
to
think
that
a
state
can't
have
exemptions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seems
anomalous
at
the
bottom
line.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
it
says
another
tax
that
discriminates.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
means
something
different
than
any
other
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
why
isn't
the
most
natural
reading
of
that
language
to
refer
to
any
tax
other
than
an
ad
valorem
property
tax?
