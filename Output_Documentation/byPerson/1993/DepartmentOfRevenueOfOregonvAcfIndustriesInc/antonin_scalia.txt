justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that's
reflected
in
11503(a)(4)
which
defines
property
to
be
only
property
that
is
subject
to
a
property
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
linder,
i
don't
understand
where
you
get
this
up
to
a
point.
you
don't
seem
to
have
the
courage
of
your
convictions
on
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
up
to
a
point,
past
a
certain
point
it
will
not,
no
longer
be
the
general
system
that
congress
had
in
mind?
i
mean,
we're
supposed
to
intuit
what
congress...
you
come
to
us
with
a
textual
argument
and
your
textual
argument
is
simply
that
by
reason
of
1105(a)(4)
it
is,
you
have
simply
not,
there
is
no
rate
applicable
to
commercial
and
industrial
property
that
is
not
taxed,
and
therefore
you
can't
possibly
be
discriminating
against
that
property.
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
take
it
the
way
it's
written,
and
say
that
the
safeguard
against
what
justice
ginsburg
is
worried
about
is
simply
that
no
state
is
going
to
cut
off
its
nose
to
spite
its
face
and
exempt
everybody
except
railroads.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
get
to
some
limitation.
i
know
it's
a
feel
good
limitation,
we
all
would
like
to
have
it
there,
but
how
do
you
get
it
out
of
the
text
as
you
have
read
the
text
to
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
concede
that,
but
how
do
you
get
it
out
of
the
text?
suppose
i
have
a
system
in
which
i
exempt
everything
except
railroads,
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
that
exempts
everything
except
railroads.
don't
you
have
to
say
under
your
theory
of
the
statute
that
that's
okay,
if
the
state
wants
to
be
that
nutty
and
collect
no
other
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
bring
yourself
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
what
was
contemplated.
i
care
what
was
legislated
against--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
subsection
(c)
you
referred
to,
it
demonstrates
that
this
is
not
a
finely
crafted
piece
of
legislation,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
says
you
can't
get
relief
for
anything
except
discrimination
by
variable
assessment.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
strict
scrutiny
for
railroads.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
i
don't,
i
really
have
no
idea
what,
how
to
measure
the
kind
of
discrimination
you're
talking
about
under
the
first
three
portions,
and
when
i'm
confronted
with
a
statute
like
this
i
am
inclined
to
give
it
the
meaning
that
will
least
confuse
the
federal
courts
for
the
next
50
years,
and
if
congress
wants
to
be
more
precise
they
can.
why
isn't
the
state's
interpretation
just
that
kind
of
an
interpretation?
you
can
exempt
anything
you
want,
and
i'm
not
even
worried
about
before.
i
guess
you
could
say
well,
you're
going
to
have
to
do
some
fancy
footwork
on
the
before
to
figure
out
what
discrimination
was,
but
i
wouldn't
even
have
to
do
that
because
subsection
(c)
says
you
don't
get
relief
under
(4).
justice
antonin
scalia
address
why
the
state's
solution
isn't
the
simplest,
the
one
that
puts
less
strain
on
the
federal
courts
and
less
fosters
litigation
into
the
indefinite
future.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
you
come
up
with
some
test
that
i
don't
know
how
to
figure
out,
when
you
decide
there
are
too
many
exemptions
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we're
certainly
in
the
field
of
restricting
state
action.
we
have
a
canon
that
says
you
have
to
be
very
clear
when
you're
trying
to
impair
traditional
state
action,
and
certainly
the
imposition
of
taxes
is
traditional
state
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
not
remedial
legislation
in
your
estimation?
give
me
an
example
of
non-remedial.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not
33-1/3
percent
or
66-2/3?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
that.
[laughter]
pluck
a
number
out
of
the
air.
i
mean,
i
am
really
reluctant
to
think
that
congress
wrote
a
statute
in
which
it
expected
us
to
just
pluck
some
number
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
when
they
wanted
numbers
they
stated
numbers,
as
indicated
in
the
later
provision
where
they
say
there
has
to
be
a
5
percent
differential.
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
read
(1),
(2),
and
(3)
as
essentially
reading
out,
well,
you
have
to
read
(1),
(2),
and
(3)
as
saying
that
an
exemption
doesn't
count,
an
exemption
at
least
for
ad
valorem
taxes
does
not
count
as
discrimination
at
least
for
purposes
of
(1),
(2),
and
(3).
why
not
read
(4)
as
saying
that
exemption
is
not
considered
discrimination
for
purposes
of
(4)
either,
since
it
hasn't
been
for
(1),
(2),
and
(3)?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
whatever
constitutes
discrimination
on
the
part
of
another
tax,
total
exemption
of
some
category
is
not
it.
