what
is
your
textual
basis
for
that
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course
even
in
that
case
your
language
of
the
fourth,
article
(d)
here
refers
simply
to
discrimination
against
a
carrier,
which
would
imply
that
in
effect
it's
the
composite
bottom
line
that
you're
concerned
with
on
discrimination.
would
you
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
neither
does
it
to
say
any
other
discrimination,
which
is
the
way
you're
using
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
certainly
the
easiest
way
to
understand
the
language
congress
chose
is
to
take
the
indication
of
(1)
through
(3)
as
being
examples
of
the
discrimination
that
it
referred
to
in
the
preamble
sentence
of
(b)
and
to
assume
that
indeed
the
discriminations
that
it
is
referring
to
are
the
same
kinds
of
discriminations,
in
other
words
the
statute
in
fact
does
define
discrimination
by
example.
it
is
using
that
same
sense
of
discrimination
in
(d),
and
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
reading
of
any
other
kind
of
discrimination,
in
fact
it's
antithetical
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
not
the
point.
i
mean,
you
clearly
could
so
argue
and
you
would
probably
have
a
very
good
policy
ground
for
so
arguing,
but
i
don't
see
that
as
being
the
easiest
way
to
read
this
text.
it's
perfectly
true
that
reading
the
text
the
way
i
do
leaves
a
loophole
there.
if
some
state
really
wants
to
go
that
far,
in
the
reading
i
have
suggested
it
could
do
so.
perfectly
true.
in
which
case
i
dare
say
you
would
be
back
across
the
street
getting
that
one
fixed.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
so
odd
when
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
statute
is
to
begin
with
an
exception
to
the
tax
injunction
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
can't
take
that
view,
i
take
it
you
would
agree,
solely
as
an
inference
from
the
text
itself.
you've
got
to
go
behind
the
text
in
order
to
find
an
intentional
interpretive
canon
as
broad
as
you
propose.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
a
textual
basis.
the
textual
basis
is
that
your
preamble
to
the
whole
section
provides
the
following
acts
unreasonably
burden
and
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
they
then
give
you
three
examples.
they
then
in
subsection
(4)
use
the
word
discriminate
again,
and
there
is
a
textual
basis
for
saying
that
the
definition
of
discriminate
in
(4)
is
simply
the
same
as
the
definition
by
example
of
discriminate
which
is
set
out
in
(1),
(2),
and
(3).
that's
a
textual
basis.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
structure
of
(1)
through
(3)
to
exemplify
the
discriminations?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't
exemplify,
it
doesn't
give
an
example.
it
doesn't
exemplify.
(1),
(2),
and
(3)
are
examples,
and
they
are
examples
that
follow
the
use
of
a
general
word
discriminate.
(4)
is
not
an
example
section.
(4)
simply
uses
the
word
discriminate
again,
and
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
it's
using
the
word
in
the
same
sense
that
it
has
used
it
before
as
defined
by
the
three
examples.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
carrier
language
doesn't,
but
the
discrimination
language
still
may.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
depends
on
whether
you're
going
to
redefine
the
word
discrimination
or
not.
your
argument
assumes
that
discriminate
in
(d)
means
something
other
than
the
discrimination
exemplified
in
(a)
through
(c).
if
you
don't
make
that
assumption,
if
you
say
based
on
the
text
i
am
going
to
assume
that
discriminate
has
a
common
usage
throughout
this
section,
then
in
fact
it
is
no
objection
to
the
argument
to
say
that
yes,
you
may
indeed
leave
the
railroad
as
the
only
taxpayer
with
respect
to
a
certain
class
of
property.
and
if
that's
the
case,
if
the
state
does
cut
off
its
nose
to
spite
its
face,
congress
is
the
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
phillips,
with
respect
to
the
way
you
calculate
the
relevant
percentage,
given
the
fact
that
subsection
(d)
refers
to
discrimination
against
rail
carriers
without
reference
to
specific
classes
of
property
or
kinds
of
tax,
why
shouldn't
you
aggregate
all
of
the
property
to
get
in
effect
a
composite
rate,
in
which
case
instead
of
67
percent
you
would
get,
i
guess
what,
30
something
percent
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
why
isn't
it
a
bottom
line
analysis
as
opposed
to
a
class-by-class
analysis?
