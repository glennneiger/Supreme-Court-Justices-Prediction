mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
state's
reading
of
the
statute
the
4r
act
would
literally
prohibit
every
imaginable
form
of
state
tax
discrimination
other
than
discriminatory
property
tax
exemptions.
if
there
is
an
eye
in
this
needle
it
would
be
large
enough
to
drive
the
entire
camel
through.
the
state,
instead
of
simply
preferentially
taxing
non-railroad
property,
could
not
tax
it
at
all,
exempting
it
entirely
from
the
tax.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
unanimously
concluded
that
that
interpretation
of
the
act
is
not
sensible
and
doesn't
respond
to
either
its
language
or
its
history.
in
the
view
of
the
courts
of
appeals
subsection
(b)(4)
prohibits
a
discriminatory
tax
by
any
means
other
than
those
already
prohibited
in
the
prior
subsections.
this
is,
after
all,
national
legislation.
for
example,
ohio
could
enact
a
tax
that
discriminates
by
assessment
rates
and
that
tax
would
violate
(b)(1)
and
(2).
oklahoma
could
enact
a
tax
that
discriminates
by
tax
rates
and
that
tax
would
violate
(b)(3).
if
oregon
enacts
a
tax
that
has
discriminatory
exemptions
that
tax
in
the
language
of
the
statute
is
another
tax
that
results
in
discrimination
against
railroads.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
equal
protection
clause
under
this
court's
decision
in
lehnhausen
in
1972
doesn't
give
the
railroads
very
much
at
all.
lehnhausen
built
upon
what
i
think
we
can
call
the
pigeon
hole
rule,
which
was
adopted
in
an
opinion
by
justice
frankfurter
in
1940
in
the
chesapeake
and,
i'm
sorry,
in
the
nashville
and
chattanooga
case.
putting
those
two
rules
together,
what
this
court
has
held
is
that
the
constitution
doesn't
bar
the
states
from
treating
railroad
property
differently
from
all
other
kinds
of
property.
it
was
those
constitutional
holdings
that
were
the
impetus
for
this
legislation,
so
to
suggest
or
to
conclude
that
only
constitutional
limits
need
apply
to
discriminatory
exemptions
is
to
say
congress
didn't
change
the
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
set
up
a
standard.
the
standard
that
they
adopted
was
discrimination.
it's
a
statutory
standard,
it's
not
the
equal
protection
standard.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
it's
strict
scrutiny,
but
i
do
think
that
it's
statutory
specific
scrutiny.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
sure
if
i
can
answer
that
in
the
abstract,
but
i,
let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
your
question
this
way.
it
is
a
normal
approach
in
transportation
legislation
to
talk
about
discrimination,
and
in
talking
about
discrimination
the
cases
make
the
point
that
a
difference
in
treatment
is
not
necessarily
a
discriminatory
treatment.
that
here,
like
in
other
commercial
contexts,
a
difference
in
treatment
creates
an
inference
of
discrimination,
but
the
states
can
rebut
that
inference
by
a
showing
of
an
appropriate
justification.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
it
falls
under
(1)
through
(3)
you
don't
have
to
decide
whether
it's
discriminatory.
those
are
objective
standards.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
say
it's
discriminatory
to
have
disparate
assessment
rates.
the
statute
says
that.
but
with
respect
to
exemptions
the
court
needs
to
decide
whether
the
exemptions
are
discriminatory.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
what
you're
comparing
is
the
difference
in
treatment
between
the
two
types
of
property.
in
the,
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
public
service
company
v.
snead,
which
dealt
with
an
analogous
statute,
different
in
many
details
but
analogous,
and
in
that
case
the
court
indicated
that
the
justifications
have
to
be
related
to
the
type
of
the
tax
involved.
in
our
view
there
are
at
least
three
justifications
that
a
state
could
claim
to
support
a
difference
in
treatment.
the
first
is
to
us
the
relatively
obvious
one
of
a
compensatory
tax
where
the
exemption
is
with
respect
to
property
whose
value
is
taxed
under
a
different
statutory
scheme.
because
that
exemption
is
so
obvious
to
us
it
explains
why
congress
didn't
try
to
deal
with
exemptions
in
(b)(1),
(2),
and
(3).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
agree
with
your
statement
in
the
abstract.
of
course
many
states
have
motor
vehicle
taxes
substantially
higher.
another
example
of
a
compensating
tax
might
be
a
severance
tax.
severance
tax
is
imposed
once
on
the
day
of
the
production
rather
than
every
year
prior
to
production.
there
may
be
many
valid
reasons
to
treat
the
value,
to
tax
the
value
of
that
property
under
that
different
method.
the
key
part
of
the
compensating
tax
approach
is
that
it
is
a
tax
to
which
the
railroad
property
would
not
also
be
subject.
it
is
a
different
tax
scheme
on
value
that
is
not
discriminatory
in
its
character
or
in
its
application.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
sure
which
part
of
that
question
you
want
me
to
address,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
with
all
respect,
justice
scalia--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--with
all
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
canon
of
statutory
interpretation
whose
objective
is
to
avoid
litigation
of
this
kind
of
an
issue.
but
the
statutory
standard
is
discrimination.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
the
piedmont
case
in
1932
this
court
said
that
national
transportation
legislation
is
remedial
legislation
which
should
be
broadly
interpreted.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
a
broad
interpretation
is
necessary.
i
am--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
am
not
sure.
a
non-remedial
legislation--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not
sure
if
i
can
answer
why
they
would
ever
do
it.
i
think
they
always
have
an
objective
in
mind,
but
i
think
that
the
court
is
aware
of
the
distinctions
it
has
drawn
in
its
cases
between
different
types
of
statutes
and
has
addressed
as
remedial
a
statute
such
as
this
one
that
displaces
pre-existing
or
non-existing
law
to
achieve
the
objective
of
the
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
what
these
types
of
statutes
do
is
they...
well,
there
are
two
types.
there's
the
new
regulatory
scheme
which
this
case
does
not
involve.
this
is
not
a
preemption
case.
this
is
a
substantive
remedial
case.
so
if
that
were
a
distinction
that
i
believe
that
is
appropriate
to
draw
you
could
make,
you
could
apply
that
distinction
here.
but
my
point
with
respect
to
justice
scalia
is
that
the
statute
specifies
the
standard.
it
says
a
tax
that
discriminates.
it
is
the
court's
function
to
determine
what
that
means.
and
if
i
could
return
to
what
i
was
suggesting--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--business
inventories
would
be
exempt...
if
business
inventories
are
exempt,
if
they
are
a
type
of
property
that
railroads
would
normally
own
then
it's
not
discriminatory
to
exempt
it.
if
it's
a
type
of
property
that
is
taxed
under
a
different
ad
valorem
scheme
then
it's
not
discriminatory.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
absent
a
justification
it
is
discriminatory.
that
is
what
this
court
has
held
under
analogous
statutes
involving
transportation.
it
is
the
state's
obligation
to
justify
it.
if
they
cannot
provide
the
justification
it
violates
the
statute.
