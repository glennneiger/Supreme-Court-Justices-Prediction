justice

h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-74,
department
of
revenue
of
oregon
v.
acf
industries.
ms.
linder,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
because
it
says
another
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
why
do
you
shy
away
from
the
logical,
what
seems
to
me
logical
definition
of
another
tax
in
your
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
which
was
some
other
tax
other
than
an
ad
valorem
property
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
we
don't
have
to
answer
it
here
because
what
you're
talking
about
is
an
ad
valorem
property
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
linder.
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
the
government,
as
i
understand
it,
agrees
with
the
railroads
on
the
scope
of
section
(4),
but
says,
contrary
to
the
railroads,
that
every
differentiation
is
not
a
discrimination.
how
does
that
give
the
railroads
anything
more
than
the
equal
protection
clause
already
gives
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
think
congress
set
up
kind
of
a
new
kind
of
equal
protection
analysis
different
from
the
courts,
the
constitution,
and
it
was
just
to
be
developed
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
congress
ever
pass
legislation
that
wasn't
remedial,
remedying
something?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
all
statutes
displace
pre-existing
or
non-existing
law?
if
not,
why
are
they
passed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
word
mr.
phillips?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
nothing
in
this
case
turns
upon
the
meaning
of
the
word
"fully"
in
the
stipulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
where
did
impose
another
tax,
where
did
that
language
come
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
surely
if
the
language
we're
dealing
with
says
impose
another
tax
that
doesn't
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
as
if
it
said
any
other
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
you
say
that
was
so
in
the
burlington
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
the
courts
of
appeals
explain
the
use
of
the
word
(4)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
it
modifies
the
word
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(b)(4)
does
use
the
word
discriminate,
where
(1),
(2),
and
(3)
don't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
ms.
linder,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
linder.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-74
department
of
revenue
of
oregon
versus
acf
industries
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
