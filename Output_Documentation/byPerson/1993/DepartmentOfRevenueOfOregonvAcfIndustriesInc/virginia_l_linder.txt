ms.
virginia
l.
linder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
like
the
one
that
precedes
it,
turns
on
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
it
involves
a
single
statute.
section
11503
of
the
4r
act
prohibits
certain
state
practices
that
congress
has
decided
unreasonably
burden
and
discriminate
against
the
railroad
industry.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
claim
that
the
oregon
property
tax
system
discriminates
against
them
because
it
exempts
certain
categories
of
property
from
its
general
property
tax
system
without
giving
the
same
exemption
to
the
property
that
they
own.
the
question
here
is
whether
oregon's
exemption
policies
discriminate
against
railroads
in
any
way
that
congress
acted
to
prohibit.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
o'connor,
the
precise
question
is
the
meaning
of
subsection
(4).
that
is
the
only
subsection
under
which
they
proceeded.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
our
position
is
that's
exactly
what
it
means.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
yes.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
that,
the
question
of--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--your
honor,
that's
an
open
question.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
taken
as
a
matter
of
plain
language
it
certainly
suggests
that.
taken
as
a
matter
of
structure
from
the
act
as
a
whole,
a
more
narrowing
definition
can
be
given
to
it.
and
as
a
result
lower
courts--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--as
a
matter
of
pure
plain
language,
sitting
along
in
that
section,
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
agree
with
that.
when
you
look
at
it
in
the
context
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
what
you
end
up
with
with
the
any
other
tax
that
discriminates
are
five
words
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
is
otherwise
wholly
dedicated
to
the
proposition
or
to
tests
on
ad
valorem
property
taxes.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
and
we
believe
that's
exactly
what
that
provision
was
intended
to
reach.
we
agree
that
it
would
reach
a
gross
receipts
tax.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
the
language
would
seem
to
sweep
more
broadly
in
the
provision
itself.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
i
believe
that's
our
opponent's
argument,
your
honor.
it
is
certainly
not
ours.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
kennedy,
if
i
understand
the
point
of
the
question
correctly,
i
think
my
answer
is
that
if
we
were
looking
at
some
other
tax
on
property,
other
than
a
generally
applicable
ad
valorem
property
tax,
that
was
reached
under
subsection
(b)(4),
you
might,
the
question
then
would
be
other
exemptions
from
that
tax,
i
would
think,
and
what
congress
would
mean
in
terms
of
exemptions
from
that
same
tax.
i
don't
think
that
would
create
license
to
go
back
up
and
revisit
the
judgment
that
was
made
in
the
first
three
subsections
of
the
act
about
exempt
property.
our
basic
view
of
the
statute
is
this.
it
is
a
statutory
hole.
the
first
three
subsections
of
the
statute
are
addressed
to
a
generally
applicable
ad
valorem
property
tax
system,
and
what
you
get
if
you
want
to
sue
a
state
for
its
application
of
that
tax
to
your
property,
is
you
get
what
those
first
three
sections
provide
for.
subsection
(b)(4)
does
not
go
back
up
and
revisit
the
grounds
on
which
you
may
sue
the
state.
subsection
(4)
provides
exactly
what,
it
means
what
it
says.
you
can--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--that's
right.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
mean
to
shy
away
from
that
at
all.
we
think
it
does
mean
that.
the
question
may
be,
and
it's
not
a
question
you
need
to
answer
in
this
case
we
don't
believe,
how
much
broader
it
is,
how
far
beyond
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
it
goes.
for
instance,
would
it
extend
to
a
corporate
income
tax?
that
question
has
never
been
answered
and
lower
courts
have
divided
somewhat
on
those
things.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
precisely.
the
tax
that
oregon
levies
on
the
railroad
cars
in
this
case
is
a
tax
derived
from
our
general
ad
valorem
property
tax
system
that
applies
to
everyone.
and
for
that
reason,
if
it
is
to
be
tested
it
needs
to
be
tested
under
subsections
(1)
through
(3).
it
is
not
a
tax
that
can
be
tested
under
subsection
(b)(4).
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
it
does
not.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
stevens,
my
first
answer
to
it
is
you
could
test
it
under
subsection
(b)(4).
whether
it
would
violate
the
statute
is
a
far
more
difficult
question,
but
we
would
agree
you
may
challenge
that
under
subsection
(b)(4).
the
difficulty
is
for
purposes
of
that
section
we
have
absolutely
no
test
to
apply--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--but
at
that
point--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
a
discriminatory
tax
at
that
point.
i
believe
that
it
is
not
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
in
the
sense
that
congress
intended
it.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
yes.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
o'connor,
that
hypothetical
tax
simply
doesn't
fit
the
model
contained
in
subsections
(1)
through
(3).
the
reference
to
an
ad
valorem
tax,
granted
one
that
does
not
have
the
word
general
in
it,
is,
we
think
the
basic
understanding
there
is
a
broad,
generally
applied
tax
that
extends
to
real
and
personal
property
with
a
host
of
taxpayers
in
that
group,
and
that's
certainly
consistent
with
the
history
if
it's
necessary
to
resort
to
that
to
see
what
congress
was
thinking
about
when
it
used
the
terms.
it's
also
very
much
the
kind
of
property
tax
that
is
contained
within
the
structure
and
the
model
that
is
devised
by
virtue
of
the
assumption
that
we
are
going
to
test
the
rates
and
the
assessments
that
are
levied
on
railroad
property
against
some
other
group
of
comparisons
and
seek
an
average.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
o'connor,
it
is
typical,
yes.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
o'connor,
i
know
of
no
state
that
does
not.
under
our
approach
in
that
case
what
the
carlines
must
do
is
they
must
bring
their
challenge
under
subsections
(1)
through
(3),
and
if
the
challenge
is
brought
there
then
the
immediate
result
is
that
they
have
no
cause
of
action.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
exactly
our
reading
of
the
statute.
our
view
of
what
congress
both
said
and
did
and
intended
is
that
this
was
essentially
an
equalization
formula
for
railroad
property.
congress
intended
railroad
property
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
average
taxed
property
in
the
jurisdiction.
it
is
a
very
different
proposition,
states
raise
and
lower
taxes
on
different
taxpayers
and
different
items
of
property,
as
does
the
federal
government,
for
a
host
of
reasons,
drawing
distinctions
between
types
of
property
and
owners.
but
when
governments
exempt
you
are
usually
dealing
with
a
very
powerful
policy
choice
on
a
government's
part
that
suggests
that
perhaps
a
very
different
policy
is
at
work,
and
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
policy
choice
that
drove
the
wording
of
the
comparison
class
and
caused
it
to
be
limited
to
property
subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
so
it
is
not
the
illogical
result
in
any
sense
to
say
that
if
we
want
to
equalize
railroad
property
and
insure
that
they
are
not
taxed
higher
than
some
average,
we
will
look
to
some
comparison
that
consists
of
taxed
property.
typically
in
equalization
formulas,
which
were
expressly
contemplated
as
congress
crafted
the
act,
you
do
not
look
to
exempt
property
to
equalize
because
as
a
policy
matter
something
different
is
going
on
when
states
take
the
property
out
of
its
tax
base
altogether.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
scalia,
yes.
that,
we
believe
that's
exactly
what
it
means.
none
of
the
parties
in
this
case
seem
to
have
squared
off
with
us
very
directly
on
that
issue.
every
lower
court
that
has
examined
it
has
so
concluded,
and
we
think
for
sound
policy
reasons
or
sound
text-based
reasons.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
kennedy,
my
understanding
is
that
the
more
common
model
is
that
there
is
not
a
broad
classification
system
in
most
states.
there
are
some
states,
i
believe
i
have
heard
of
one
that
has
as
many
as
21
different
classes
of
property,
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
common
model
in
the
states
is
to
have
a
fairly
uniform
system
between
real
and
personal
property
alike.
if
we
are
correct
that
subsection
(b)(4)
has
no
application
to
a
general,
to
the
levy
of
a
generally
applicable
property
tax,
and
certainly
even
if
there
is
some
application
that
you
can
bring
for
purposes
of
subsection
(b)(4),
it
should
not
be
used
to
test
a
state's
exemption
policies
because
those
were
expressly
contemplated
in
the
first
three
sections
and
congress
adopted
an
unqualified
position
on
that
matter.
then
we
think
this
case
is
emend.
at
that
point
the
carlines
do
not
state
a
claim
under
the
statute.
there
are
other
questions
if
we're
wrong
concerning
the
remedy
that
would,
the
test
that
you
would
apply
and
the
remedy
that
you
would
attach,
and
those
questions
become
increasingly
difficult
once
you
begin
to
try
to
take
subsection
(b)(4),
which
was
not
at
all
tailored
to
the
kind
of
challenge
that
they
bring,
and
determine
how
it
is
you
would
even
challenge
the
very
thing
that
congress
contemplated
in
the
first
three
subsections.
the
difficult
with
coming
up
with
a
test
is
another
reason
that
we
think
it
demonstrates
that
neither
the
language
nor
the
structure
nor
anything
congress
intended,
expected
that
we
would
be
in
subsection
(b)(4).
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
that
is,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
what
the
district
court
assumed
was
one
of
the
possible
things
it
might
have
to
test
for
under
subsection
(b)(4).
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
that
is
correct
to
a
point.
that
is
our
reading,
and
i
have
to
say
to
a
point.
there
seems
clearly
to
be
a
point
at
which
if
you
carve
away
everything
out
of
your
tax
system
except
the
thing
that
looks
like
a
railroad,
at
that
point
you
do
not
have
the
broadly
applicable
tax
system
that
congress
envisioned.
the
problem
with
both
what
the
district
court
then
examined,
it
found
no
violation
even
if
it
were
to
use
that
kind
of
an
inquiry,
but
the
problem
with
the
way
the
examination
gets
made,
and
it's
the
problem
with
the
way
the
carlines
want
to
make
it
in
this
case
with
their
persistent
use
of
the
number
67
percent
of
exempt
property,
the
point
of
talking
about
those
kinds
of
percentages
is
to
suggest
that
the
state
is
moving
towards
a
system
that
is
no
longer
broadly
applicable.
if
you're
going
to
test
for
that,
you
do
not
look
at
the
kinds
of
numbers
certainly
that
the
carlines
have
used
in
this
case.
they
don't
tell
you
anything
about
how
much
property
you
are
taxing.
they
tell
you
something
about
how
valuable
that
property
is,
but
it
can
be
one
exemption
and
in
this
case
it
largely
is.
it
is
business
inventory.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
scalia--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--i
do
get
it
out
of
the
text,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
are
talking
about
something
so
different
than
what
we
were
talking
about
in
oregon,
that
it
wouldn't
look
anything
like
what
oregon
is.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
i
would
agree
i
should
adopt
that
position
wholeheartedly--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--i
have
difficulty
bringing
myself
to
do
it,
your
honor,
because...
and
again
this
is
text-based.
if
you
look
to
what
is
going
on
in
subsections
(1)
through
(3),
the
very
expectation
of
the
language
of
those
sections
and
the
model
that
is
created
in
them
is
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
property
tax
system
that
includes
on
some
basis
multiple
property
tax
owners
and
multiple
kinds
of
property.
and
i
think,
for
better
or
for
worse,
that
that's
exactly
what
congress
intended,
and
if
you
have
a
target
tax
that
is
levied
on
one
property
tax
owner
or
one
piece
of
property,
that
is
not
what
was
contemplated
there.
you're
also
correct,
it's
not
contemplated
there
because
it
never
happens.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
and
i'm
talking
about
text
and
structure
when
i
say
that.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
stevens,
no.
the
ninth
circuit...
if
the
question
is
did
we
take
the
position
that
the
test
was
some
majority
kind
of
test--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--justice
stevens,
the
ninth
circuit
statement
on
that
was
incorrect.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
what
we
said
to
the
ninth
circuit
about
that
was
even
assuming
that
the
test
is
what
they
say
it
is,
if
you
put
the
numbers
together
the
way
we
thought
was
accurate
they
didn't
get
to
50
percent.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
that's
right.
that's
how
carlines
get
to
their
67
percent.
they
have
to
do
that
or
they
don't
get
to--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--no,
we
don't.
we
think
that
is
dramatically--
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
--yes.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
there
are
two.
the
first
is
in
the
comparison
class
itself
which
refers
to
real
or
personal
property
and
doesn't
suggest
that
you
have
to
draw
a
line
between
them
and
not
put
them
both
together.
there
is
another
base
as
well.
if
you
look
to
subsection
(c)
which
refers
to
the
assessment
methodology
that
a
state
would
use,
there
is
a
potential
for
the
assessment
method
to
not
have
a
sufficient
number
of
properties
in
the
comparison
so
that
you,
if
the
district
court
is
dissatisfied
that
it
is
a
reasonable
sample
of
properties
from
the
comparison
class,
the
district
court
may
then
pull
a
new
sample
from
the
entire
property
tax
base
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
and
at
that
point
the
language
is
quite
clear,
you
go
to
all
of
the
property.
the
point
of
distinguishing
in
the
statute
between
real
and
personal,
there
is
some
doubt
about
what
congress
would
intend
if
you
had
a
state
that
distinguished
for
purposes
of
rates
or
assessments
between
real
and
personal
property,
and
there
is
legislative
history,
if
you
resort
to
it,
to
suggest
that
in
a
state
that
drew
a
distinction
that
you
shouldn't
then
look,
cross
those
boundaries
and
look
at
the
rates
or
the
assessments
that
apply
to
the
different
kinds.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
i
would
agree.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
justice
scalia,
it
demonstrates
that
very
well.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
that's
exactly
what
it
says.
it
came
into
the
statute
at
a
time
that
the
statute
addressed
only
assessments.
it
was
never
changed
even
though
the
statute
evolved
after
that
point.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
virginia
l.
linder
i've
only
a
couple
of
points
to
make.
mr.
phillips
said
that
in
oregon
all
carlines
and
all
railroad
property
is
taxed.
that
is
not
true.
railroad
property
is
subject
to
the
same
set
of
exemptions.
if
railroads
own
timberland
they
receive
the
same
tax
treatment
as
any
other
taxpayer.
as
a
result
of
that,
that
is
true
with
respect
to
any
exemption,
business
inventory
as
well.
the
point
of
that
is
that
in
fact
there
is
extraordinary
uniformity
in
the
state
of
oregon
in
its
taxing
scheme.
railroads
and
carlines
are
in
the
host
of
a
great
number
of
population
that
consists
of
a
large
number
of
taxpayers,
a
large
number
of
taxed
property,
and
they
are
in
very
good
company
in
that
way.
they
receive
exactly
the
same
average
tax
rate
and
assessment
of
every
other
taxpayer
in
the
state
of
oregon.
put
aside
the
percentages
and
the
numbers
which
are
designed
to
suggest
that
something
else
occurs,
it
simply
does
not.
beyond
that
our
only
other
point
is
the
point
we
began
with
with
this
statute.
when
congress
crafted
subsections
(1)
through
(3)
and
defined
the
comparison
class
it
was
not
simply
declining
to
deal
with
exempt
property
as
the
united
states'
solicitor
suggests.
it
was
defining
discrimination
in
the
process
of
doing
that.
and
the
express
policy
choice
plain
in
the
text
of
the
statute
was
that
states
may
exempt
property
from
their
taxation
schemes
without
penalty
to
railroads
in
the
form
of
lower
taxes.
that
same
express
policy
runs
directly
to
timberland
and
agricultural
land
as
to,
you
can
no
more
put
exempt
property
back
in
the
calculus
and
be
true
to
that
policy
choice
than
you
can
put
timberland
or
agricultural
land
back
in
the
formula
as
well.
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
in
the
first
three
sections
of
the
act
congress
gave
with
one
hand
and
then
came
down
to
the
fourth
and
took
it
away.
