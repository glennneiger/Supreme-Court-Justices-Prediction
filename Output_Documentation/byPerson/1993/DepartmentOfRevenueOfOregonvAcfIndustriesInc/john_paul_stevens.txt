ms.
linder,
you
use
the
word
general
ad
valorem
property
tax.
does
the
statute
contain
the
word
general?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
the
situation
be
in
your
view
if
all
other
taxpayers
in
the
state
paid
a
gross
receipts
tax,
an
income
tax,
a
sales
tax,
several
taxes,
but
none
of
them
paid
an
ad
valorem
tax
except
the
railroads,
so
it
was
a
special
ad
valorem
tax?
would
that
violate
the
statute
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
be
no
discrimination
because
everybody
who
is
assessed
an
ad
valorem
tax
would
pay
at
the
same
rate
and
the
same
amount.
all
railroads
would
pay
the
same
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
know
whether
you
think
that
would
violate
the
statute
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
congress
intended
to
include
the
word
general
even
though
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--okay.
would
you
refresh
my
recollection
as
to
your
position
in
the
district
court?
did
both
parties
agree
on
a
50
percent
rule
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
get
the
impression
from
the
court
of
appeals
description
of
what
went
on
in
the
district
court
that
you
would
have
agreed
that
if
there
had
been
an
exemption
of
over
50
percent
of
property
in
the
state
that
then
there
would
have
been
a
violation,
and
you
in
fact
argue
it
was
only
30
percent
whereas
they
said
it
was
67
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
