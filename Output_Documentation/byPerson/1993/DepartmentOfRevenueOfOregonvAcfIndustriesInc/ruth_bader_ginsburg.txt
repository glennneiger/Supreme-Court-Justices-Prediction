justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
linder,
how
do
you
answer
the
argument
that
under
your
view
you
couldn't
have
property
b
taxed
at
a
lower
rate
than
railroad
property,
that
would
be
barred,
but
you
could
have
a
total
exemption
of
property
b,
and
that
would
be
okay?
under
your
reading
of
the
statute
i
take
it
that
that
would
follow,
that
you
couldn't
tax
property
b
a
little
less,
but
the
state
could
exempt
it
altogether.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
linder,
what
is
your
view
of
the
district
court,
the
district
court
held
for
oregon
but
it
recognized
the
possibility
of
de
facto
discrimination,
which
i
took
to
mean
if
it
turned
out
that
they
were
really
exempting
everything
except
railroad
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
take
it
that
your
reading
of
subsection
(b)(4)
wouldn't
even
leave
room
for
that
because
you
say
it
just
has
no
office
with
respect
to
this
very
same
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
you
said
it
doesn't
mean
what
it
means
in
equal
protection.
you're
not
willing
to
say
it's
fixed
scrutiny
or
what
the
standard
is.
you
said
you
can't
answer
the
question
in
the
abstract
so
let
me
give
you
a
concrete
illustration,
one
category
that's
exempt
is
business
inventory.
the
railroad
cars
are
not
exempt,
business
inventory
is.
how
does
that
fit,
is
that
discrimination
or
not?
how
does
one
go
about
resolving
that
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
business
inventory
is
exempt
from
this
tax.
railroad
cars
are
not.
how
does
one
determine
if
that
is
impermissible
discrimination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
much
so
that
it
essentially
eclipses
the
other.
i
mean,
why
do
you
need
(1),
(2),
(3)
if
you
have
(4)?
if
(4)
says
no
discrimination
against
railroad
property,
period,
then
(1)
to
(3)
are
superfluous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
position
essentially
that
this
is
a
most
favored
taxpayer
clause?
to
the
extent
that
there
is
business
and
industrial
property,
if
any
of
that
property
is
exempt
then
the
railroad
property
must
be
exempt?
