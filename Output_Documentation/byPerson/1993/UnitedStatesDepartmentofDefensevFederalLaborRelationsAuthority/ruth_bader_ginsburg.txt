and
yet
it's
true
that
every
circuit
so
construed
this
complex
of
statutes
until
this
court's
decision
in
reporters
committee,
is
that
not
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was...
it
was
more
than
collective
bargaining
interests
in
itself.
it
was
another
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
do
i
take
it
that
your
position
is
that
the
labor
management
relations
statute
counts
for
nothing?
it
seems
that
it's
no
different,
in
your
analysis.
if
this
had
been
a
plain
old
foia
request
from
any
member
of
the
public,
that
we
should
regard
this
situation
precisely
the
same
way.
it
doesn't
matter
that
it's
a
union
making
the
request.
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
request
emanates
initially
from
the
labor
management
relations
statute.
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
reporters
committee
there
was
no
other
federal
statute
that
came
into
play,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
nothing
comparable
to
the...
that
was
a
straight
foia
request
by
the
reporters
committee.
here
we
have
a
request
that
is
made
not
under
foia,
but
under
the
labor
management
relations
statute.
and
that's...
the
presence
of
another
statute
was
not
a
factor
in
reporters
committee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
your...
on
your
first
argument,
the
privacy
act
applies
to
the
public
sector
and
not
the
private
sector,
but
the...
the
union,
it
applies
to
the
public
sector,
but
in
the
interests
of
private
people
as
well
as
public
employees,
right,
the
privacy
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's,
as
far
as
the
employee
is
concerned,
a
little
hard
to
distinguish
the
situation
of
the
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
they
happen
to
work
for
a
federal
agency,
not
because
there's
something
about
their
employee
status
that
would
require...
that
indicates
a
congressional
policy
to
give
them
greater
protection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
does
the
labor
management
relations
statute,
which
would
otherwise
make
this
information...
at
least
that's
a
given
in
this
case,
isn't
it,
that
were
it
not
for
the
reference
to
the
privacy
act,
that
this
information
would
be
relevant
to
the
collective
bargaining
function--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
therefore
discloseable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
happens
in
the
private
sector.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--sending
letters
to
the
shop,
but
not
to
the
home.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
isn't
the
difference,
and
what
makes
this
a
hard
case,
is
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
the
union
has
no
better
standing
than
anyone
else?
but
you're
kind
of
claiming
here
that
since
your...
since
your
original
request
is
not
made
under
foia,
but
made
under
the
labor
relations
act,
that
the
union
uniquely
can
have
access
to
this
information.
that
the
weighing...
the
public
interest
to
be
weighed
is
the
union's
special
interest
in
collective
bargaining,
so
that
you
could
screen
out
other
requesters
if
you
can
attribute
this
collective
bargaining
purpose
as
something
to
be
weighed
against
the
privacy
interest,
which
an
ordinary
requester
wouldn't...
wouldn't
have.
isn't
that
really
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
it...
and
i
want
to
be
clear
on
what
your
position
is.
are
you
saying
that
if
the
flra's
view
of
this
prevails,
then
the
union
will
have
access
to
this
information,
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
any
other
requester
would
have
access
to
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
on
the
routine-use
part,
that
seems...
there
was
some
confusion
over
the
role
that
that,
in
fact,
plays
in
this
picture.
one
of
the
union
briefs
seemed
to
be
saying
that
what
the
agencies
are
doing
here...
they're
not
serving
the
purpose
of
the
labor
management
relations
statute,
they're
not
serving
the
purpose
of
foia,
really.
what
they
are
serving
the
purpose
of
is
maximum
executive
control,
because
if
they
wanted
this
information
available
it's
in
their
hands
to
do
so
by
declaring
it
a
routine-use.
so
they're...
what
the...
their
argument
is,
essentially,
maximum
executive
discretion,
not
the
privacy
interest
of
the
employees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
flra
didn't
seem
to
go
that
far
in
its
argument.
afge
did
in
its
brief.
and
i
was
wondering
how...
what
flra's
position
is
on
the
routine-use?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
are
you
arguing
that
the
flra
deserves
the
same
respect
in
what
it
thinks
the
federal
labor
statute
means
as
the
nlrb
does
in
its
field?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah.
mr.
smith--
--mr.
smith,
you
recognize
no
difference
between
the
identify
of
the
requester
and
the
purpose
of
the
request.
it's
one
thing
to
say
we
weigh
the
interest
in
privacy
against
nothing
on
the...
on
the
other
side,
or
we
weigh
the
interest
in
privacy
against
the
interests
in
collective
bargaining
as
advanced
by
the
labor
management
relations
statute.
are
you
saying
that
in
this
calculus
you
do
not
weigh,
you
may
not
weigh
the...
the
public
interest
reflected
in
the
labor
management
relations
statute?
