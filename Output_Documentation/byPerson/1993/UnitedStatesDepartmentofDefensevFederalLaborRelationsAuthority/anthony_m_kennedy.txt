that's
another
factor
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
not
only
is
this
request
arguably
supported
by
a
statute.
and
you
said,
well
there
are
lots
of
statutes.
here
we
have
an
agency
of
the
federal
government
which
has
taken
a
position
saying
that
it's
necessary
for
the
functions
of
that
agency
to
be
performed
that
the
information
be
disclosed.
does
the
federal
labor
relations
service
promulgate
regulations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree.
yet,
to
the
extent
that
they
have
expressed
their
position
through
the
proper
authority
and
the
proper
methods
of
promulgating
their
position,
we
have
something
more
than
just
a
citizen
citing
a
statute.
we
have
a
citizen
citing
the
mandate
of
the
federal
agency.
