justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wright,
would
you
just
help
me
out
on
the
private
sector
law
and
the
private
sector.
is
it
clear
that...
i
gather
a
collective
bargaining
representative
has
access
to
names
and
addresses
of
everybody
in
the
union.
but
during
organizing
campaigns
before
a
collective
bargaining
representative
has
been
selected
when
two
unions
are
competing
for
support
among
employees,
are
the
competing
unions
entitled
to
get
these
names
and
addresses
in
the
private
sector?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
have
that
sort
of
situation
often
in
the
federal
sector
where
you
have
two
unions
trying
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
you.
would
it
make
a
difference...
could
the
union
go
directly
under
foia
and
get
the
material
and
make
the
same
arguments
you
make?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
we
need
them
for
organizing
purposes
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
they
uniformly
held
that
the
disclosure
is
not
required
under
the
foia,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
how
do
you
get
around
the
language
"required
under
section
552
of
this
title?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
language
in
the
privacy
act,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but,
mr.
smith,
if
they're
not
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
privacy,
and
i
understand
your
argument,
then
i
should
think
you
should
get
them
directly
under
foia.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you
really
should
argue
that
in
the
alternative.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but,
as
justice
scalia
was
suggesting
to...
in
colloquy
with
your
opponent
earlier,
if
we
look
at
policies
of
other
statutes
in
interpreting
the
exception
to
foia,
we
could
look
at
it
even
if
the
requests
were
made
directly
under
foia.
you
didn't
even
have
to...
you
just
say
the
policy
of
the
federal
labor
relations
act
supports
the
conclusion
that
it's
not
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
privacy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
make
that
the
direct
argument,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
performance
evaluation
hypothetical
you
couldn't...
the
employee
could
give
the
xx
to
have
the
performance
evaluation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
you've
got
a
case
where
the
employee
is
the
one
who's
prosecuting
the
grievance.
and
he's
certainly...
if
you're
going
to
prosecute
his
grievance,
would
be
willing
to
give
up...
to
give
the
consent
to
get
all
the
records,
wouldn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
thought
your
hypothetical
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wright,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
exempt...
the
language
of
exemption
6.
let's
assume
you
have
to...
your
opponent
has
to
win
by
proving
it
can
be...
information
can
be
obtained
under
foia.
why
cannot--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
that's
what
the
statute
says,
so
we'll
at
least
assume
that's
what
it
means
also.
but
why...
why
is
it
not
permissible
when
you're
asking
the
question
whether...
a
request
for
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
the
employees
within
a
large
governmental
office
being
requested,
whether
the...
that's
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
if
it's
perfectly
obvious
from
the
face
of
the
request
that
the
purpose
of
the
request
is
to
facilitate
collective
bargaining
and
so
forth?
why
doesn't...
isn't
it
necessary
to
take
a
look
at
that
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
invasion
is
clearly
unwarranted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
clearly
unwarranted.
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
it's
covered
by
the
privacy
act,
and
that's
the
end
of
it,
it's
unwarranted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
i'm
just...
i'm
just
trying
to
think
through
whether
even
assuming
it's
wholly
within
foia's
domain
and
even
assuming
the
identity
of
requester
is
irrelevant,
what...
exactly
what
is
weighed
when
you
compare
"clearly
unwarranted"
on
the
one
hand
and
"could
reasonably
be
expected
to
constitute
an
unwarranted.
"
on
the
other.
it's
the
difference
between
six
and
seven.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
just
as
though
it
was
an
advertising
agency
wanting
to
make
up
a
list
of
people
to
send
catalogs
to,
or
something
like
that.
