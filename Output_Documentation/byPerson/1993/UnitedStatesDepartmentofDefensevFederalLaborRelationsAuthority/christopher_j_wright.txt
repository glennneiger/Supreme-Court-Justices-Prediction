mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
federal
agencies
must
disclose
the
home
addresses
of
federal
employees
to
unions.
three
statutes
are
involved.
the
federal
labor
relations
statute
provides
that,
to
the
extent
not
prohibited
by
law,
unions
are
entitled
to
information
that's
necessary
for
collective
bargaining.
the
parties
agree
that
"to
the
extent
not
prohibited
by
law.
"
references
the
privacy
act,
and
the
parties
further
agree
that
in
the
absence
of
an
applicable
exception
to
the
privacy
act,
the
home
addresses
are
not
discloseable.
so
the
legal
issue
here
is
whether
an
exception
to
the
privacy
act
authorizes
the
disclosure
of
home
addresses.
the
parties
further
agree
that
the
only
arguably
relevant
exception
here
is
exception
(b)(2)
to
the
privacy
act.
that
exception
says
that
information
that
has
to
be
disclosed
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
may
be
disclosed
under
the
privacy
act.
and
the
parties
also
agree
that
when
analyzed
under
foia,
the
question
is
whether
foia
exemption
6
applies.
it
states
that
information
should
not
be
disclosed
when
that
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
now,
at
this
point
the
agreement
between
the
parties
ceases.
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
takes
the
position
that
home
addresses
must
be
disclosed
to
unions.
critical
to
its
conclusion
in
that
regard
is
its
contention
that
in
deciding
what
gets
weighed
under
foia
exemption
6,
that
collective
bargaining
interests
get
weighed
in
that
foia
balance.
we
disagree.
we
agree
with
the
d.c.
circuit,
which
analyzed
this
case
and
said
that
all
that
gets
weighed
on
the
foia
side
of
the
balance
is
the
interest
in
disclosing
what
the
government's
up
to.
and
we
agree
with
the
d.c.
circuit
that
it
would,
in
fact,
require
an
imaginative
reconstruction
of
the
statutes
at
issue
to
read
them
the
way
the
flra
has
read
them.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
fifth
circuit
noted
that
in
its
decision
in
this
case.
i
would
say
that
really
what
that
shows
is
that
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
reporters
committee,
a
handful
of
courts
of
appeals
had
misconstrued
foia.
each
of
those
courts
had
concluded
that
collective
bargaining
agreements...
or,
excuse
me,
collective
bargaining
interests
could
be
weighed
on
the
foia
side
of
the
balance.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
correct.
those
courts
had
held
that
the
interests
that
can
be
weighed
on
the
foia
side
of
the
balance
are
not
limited
to
those
interests
that
tell
you
what
the
government's
up
to
or
that
open
the
light
of
agency
action
to
public
scrutiny,
the
interests
that
this
court
identified
in
reporters
committee
as
the
sole...
as
the
sole
interest
that
may
be
weighed
on
the
foia
side
of
the
balance.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
how
we
read
the...
that's
how
we
read
the
statutes.
the
federal...
the
case
starts
with
the
federal
labor
relations
statute.
it
references
the
privacy
act.
we
all
agree
that
if
the
case
ended
there,
home
addresses
would
not
be
discloseable.
the
only
arguable
exception
is
this
foia
exception,
and
once
placed
wholly
within
foia's
domain,
in
our
view,
the
union
stands
in
no
different
position
than
any
member
of
the
general
public.
and
the
further
point
follows
that
if...
if,
in
fact,
home
addresses
are
discloseable
to
unions,
then
under
reporters
committee
they're
discloseable
to
everyone,
thus
magnifying--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
it's...
unless
this
court
goes
back
on
what
it
says
in
reporters
committee,
the
identity
of
the
requester
makes
no
difference.
if
in
fact...
if
in
fact
that's
the
law
under
reporters
committee,
as
this
court
said,
then
anyone
gets
the
information.
if
this
court
engages
in
an
imaginative
reconstruction,
as
we
would
put
it,
and
limits--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
your
honor,
in
reporters
committee
the
court...
the
court
emphasized
that
there's
a
very
strong
public
interest
in
learning
about
anyone's
criminal
history.
rap
sheets
were
an
issue
there.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
let
me...
let
me
make
two
responses
there.
first...
first,
of
course,
you're
correct.
but
the
way
the
statutes
read
with
the
federal
labor
relations
statute
and
the
privacy
act
interaction,
then
passing
it
wholly
off
to
the
foia
area,
we
don't
think
the
fact
that
another
statute
could
be
referenced
makes
a
difference.
but
as
i
was
saying,
there
is
a
legitimate
public
interest
in
identifying...
in
learning
about
people's
criminal
histories.
and
i
suppose
someone
could
have...
could
have
identified
a
recidivist
statute
or
various
other
sorts
of
statutes
as
showing
that
there's
a
public
interest
that's
on
the
books,
that
shows
that
there's
interest
in
finding
out
whether
people
are
convicted
felons
or
not.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i...
the
u.s.
code
is
pretty
big
these
days.
i
assume
lots
of
people
could
come
up
with
statutes
that
arguably
supported
their
position.
i
mean,
obviously
what
the...
the
exception
the
union's
trying
to
create
here
is
somewhat
narrower,
certainly,
than--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
some--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
someone
made
a
foia
request,
i'm
sure
they
could...
since
the
federal
government
is
involved
in
so
many
things
these
days,
i'm
sure
that
they
could...
they
could...
people
could
make
claims.
but
i'm
certainly
willing
to
concede
that
it
would
be
a
narrower
exception.
it
would
still
be...
there
would
still
be
important
infringement
of
privacy
interests,
as
all...
as
all
concede,
even
if...
even
if
the
union,
the
collective
bargaining
area
were
the
only
exception
that
would
be
open.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
you
know,
we
look
at
this
as
a
privacy
act
case.
i
mean,
our
focus
isn't
so
much
on
people
in
agencies
who
are
trying
to
process
foia
requests.
our
focus
is
on
the
privacy
act,
which
all
agree
protects
this
sort
of
information
in
the
absence
of
an
applicable
exception,
and
we
don't
see
one.
there
are...
there
are,
in
fact,
12
exceptions
to
the
privacy
act.
not
one
of
them
mentions
collective
bargaining
interest.
and
in
our
view,
what
the
flra
is
trying
to
do
is
write
a
thirteenth
exception.
the
exception
that
they're
arguing
for
talks
about
foia,
and
in
reporters
committee
this
court
went
on
at
some
length,
correctly
concluding
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
turn
the
federal
government
into
a
clearing
house
for
personal
information.
it...
it
intended
to
open
agency
action
to
the
light
of
public
scrutiny.
and
it's
conceded
here...
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
against
us
here,
but
the
fifth
circuit
candidly
acknowledged
that
if...
if
what
gets
weighed
on
the
disclosure
side
of
the
foia
balance
here
is
what
this
information
tells
about
what
the
government's
doing,
we
win.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
if
i
can
make
both
a
legal
and
an
equitable
argument
to
that
point.
the
legal
argument
is
that
the
privacy
act
applies
here
and
it
doesn't
apply
in
the
private
sector,
and
that
seems
to
us
to
be
a
very
important
difference
and
indicates
that
federal
employees
have
privacy
rights
that
private
employees
don't.
turning
to
the
equitable
point,
i
think
that
there
are
some
very
important
differences
between
the
private
sector
and
the
federal
sector,
and
the
chief
of
which
is
that
it's
clear
that
federal
unions
can
arrange
to
get
adequate
contact
with
employees
at
the
workplace.
one
key
difference
is
that
there's
a
federal
service
impasses
panel
that
can
impose
proposals
on
agency
management
over
their
objection.
so
if
unions
want
more
contact
with
employees
at
work...
and
there's
no
real
issue
here
that
unions
have
plenty
of...
federal
unions
have
plenty
of
contact
at
work.
they
can...
they
can
get
more
contact.
they
can
certainly
get
enough
contact
to
ask
the
employees
for
their
home
address.
i
mean,
as
a
practical
matter,
what's
at
issue
here
is
whether
we're
going
to
override
the
choices
of
federal
employees
who
have
not
made
their
home
addresses
available
to
unions,
and
hold
that
those
home
addresses
have
to
be
disclosed
anyway,
even
though
the
employees
don't
want
their
home
addresses
disclosed.
that
happened
in
the
riverside
case
where
there
were...
there
were
34
members
of
the
bargaining
unit.
22
said
that
they
didn't
want
their
home
addresses
disclosed
to
the
union;
the
flra
disclosed
them
anyway.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
true.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
federal
employees
are
protected
by
the
privacy
act
and
private
employees,
as
employees,
are
not.
you
know,
we
think
that's--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
the...
the
privacy
act
applies
in
the...
to
federal
employees.
i
mean,
you
know,
we
think
that
that
indicates
a
congressional
policy.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yeah,
we--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
haven't
challenged
the
flra's
decision
in
that
respect.
but
if
i
can--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i'm
not
sure.
i
certainly
haven't
seen
any
relevant
to
the
issue
here.
and
let
me
make
clear
in
this
regard
that
the...
that
the
flra,
any
deference
that's
due
to
it
is
due
to
it
with
respect
to...
to
the
federal
labor
relations
statute.
no
deference
is
due
to
it
in
interpreting
the
privacy
act
or
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
the
flra
also
agrees
with
us,
i
might...
might
mention,
that
the
phrase
"to
the
extent
not
prohibited
by
law.
"
in
the
labor
relations
statute
references
the
privacy
act.
now,
we
think
they're
clearly
right
about
that,
but
that's
the
point
at
which
deference
to
them
ends.
let
me
add
in
respect
to
the
privacy
concerns
here,
in
the
d.c.
circuit
case...
i'm
not
sure
we
cited
it,
but
they
cite
the
prudential
decision
where
judge
friendly
talked
at
some
length
about
a
private
sector
case.
and,
you
know,
he
pointed
out
that,
citing
justice
frankfurter,
judges
shouldn't
close
their
eyes
as
judges
to
what
they
know
to
be
true
as
men.
i
mean,
what's
really
going
on
here
is
that
the
unions
want
to
contact
people
personally
at
home
who
are
not
union
members
to
try
to
convince
them
to
join
the
unions.
that's
what
this
fight
is
really
about.
there's
plenty
of
contact
at
the
workplace.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
true.
that's
true,
but
there's
more
contact
at
the
workplace
in
the
federal
sector.
we
think
that
there's...
their
union
are
adequately...
their
needs
are
adequately
fulfilled
in
the
federal
government
in
terms
of
the
contact
they
can
arrange
at
work,
and
that
there
is
no
need
there
for
them
to
go
contact
employees
at
home
to
urge
them
to
join
the
unions.
but
that's...
i
mean,
that's
what...
that's
what
really
at
issue
here.
and
there's
a
real
privacy
issue
here.
and,
of
course,
that's
assuming
that
you
can
somehow
read
these
statutes
to
let
the
unions
and
only
the
unions
get
this
inrormation.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
read
reporters
committee
to
mean
what
it
says,
then
everyone
has
to
get
these
home
addresses.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
that's
not
in
the...
that's--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--of
the
board.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yeah.
i
think
it
grows
out
of
the
excelsior
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
could
the...
could
the
board
decide
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--of
course,
they
haven't
come
out
that
way.
but
in
a
case
where--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--you
mean--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no.
no,
we
don't
think...
we
don't
think
it
would.
and
the
board--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
i
certainly
think
it's
fine
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
consider
privacy
interests,
but
it's
not
directed
by
the
privacy
act
to
do
so.
the
privacy
act,
all
agree,
applies
here,
and
in
the
absence
of
an
applicable
exception,
bars
release
of
home
addresses.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
that's
the...
that's
the
excelsior
rule
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--during
an
election
campaign
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
and
i'll
tell
you
what
happens.
there's...
it's
5
u.s.c.
7133(a),
i
believe,
says
that...
that
the
competing
union
gets
the
same
access
to
employees
that
the
incumbent
union
has.
and
what
that
means
in
practice
is
that
the
incumbent
union
almost
always
has
rights
to
send
letters
and
use
the
internal
mail
service
to
contact
employees.
and
during
an
election,
the
challenging
union
gets
that
same
right.
and,
frankly,
the
issue
hasn't
arisen
in
litigation,
i
assume
because
given
all
that
contact
that's
common
in
the
federal
sector,
it
hasn't
been
a
problem.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
that...
right.
and
as
i've...
as
i've
tried
to
stress,
that
is
commonly
done
and
can
easily...
easily
be
arranged
for
federal
employees.
certainly,
it
can
easily
be
arranged
in
the
course
of
doing
that,
to
ask
them
if
they
want
their
home
addresses,
if
they'll
provide
their
home
addresses.
and
so
that's
why
we
come
down
to
the
situation
here
that
all
that's
really
at
issue
is
whether
or
not
those
employees
who
choose
not
to
provide
their
home
addresses
to
unions
have
to
provide
them
anyway.
and
it's
quite
clear
that
the
unions
are
not
satisfied
with
just
the
lists
of
people
who
want
to
give
it
to
them;
that
this
case
is
about...
is
about
getting
everyone's
home
address,
even
those
people
who
don't
want
to
provide
them.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
at
this
time
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
make
clear
that
the
unions
have
the
names
of
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit,
and
they
have
the
work
addresses
of
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
and
mr.
smith
went
on
at
some
length
about
how
it
can
be
difficult
to
get
a
hold
of
new
employees'
addresses.
let
me
make
clear
that
there
are
many
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
require
management
four
times
a
year,
for
example,
to
provide
to
the
union
a
list
of
the
names
and
worksite
mailing
addresses
of
all
employees
in
the
unit,
highlighting
those
hired
during
the
prior
quarter.
so
it's
quite
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
the
names
and
work
addresses
of
federal
employees,
and
it's
done
all
the
time.
let
me
way
a
word
about
the
routine-use
exception.
two
points.
one,
of
course,
is
that
the
routine-use
exception
is
clearly
limited
to
unions.
private
information
that
is
disclosed
under
routine
use
only
goes
to
unions,
not
to
the
general
public.
let
me
say
as
well
that
we
can't
just
decide
tomorrow
morning
to
make
a
routine-use
and
give
something
out.
the
statute
provides,
first,
various
procedural
requirements.
but
also
that
it
has...
that
the
information
has
to
be
used
for
a
purpose
that
is
compatible
with
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
collected.
opm
has
construed
that
to
mean
that
home
addresses
may
be
disclosed
when
there
is
no
good
way
to
get
a
hold
of
employees
at
the
workplace.
opm
thinks
it's
compatible
with
the
purpose
for
which
home
addresses
are
collected
to
contact
employees
at
home
when
there
is
some
sort
of
emergency
or
when
you
can't
collect
them
at
work.
and
they
certainly
don't
think
that
these
can
be
handed
out
left
and
right
despite
the
privacy
act.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
like
that
assumption.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
like
that
assumption.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
justice
scalia
answered
that
for
me
by
saying
that
the
whole
thrust
of
reporters
committee,
as
i
read
it,
is
that
individuating
characteristics
don't
count.
i
mean,
the
court
clearly
said
that
the
identity
of
the
requester
doesn't
count
and,
frankly,
that
seems
to
us
to
be
clearly
in
line
with
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it...
when
it
enacted
the
freedom
of
information
act,
which,
of
course,
is
designed
to
provide
information
to
the
general
public,
not
to
particular
subclasses
of
the
general
public.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's...
that's
the
whole
thrust
of
foia.
this
court
certainly
said
it
in
reporters
committee
and
that's
how
we
think
it
ought
to
be
continued
to
be
construed.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
when...
when
you
get...
the
way
these
statutes
work
is
that
the
privacy
act
exception
that's
at
issue
here
puts
the
issue
wholly
within
foia's
domain,
and
the
question
really
is
whether--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
i
guess
i
think
that
the
identity
of
the
requester
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
purpose
for
which
the
requester
wants
the
information.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and,
of
course,
many
of
those
people
have
requested
lists
of
federal
employees'
home
addresses.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
right.
and,
of
course,
seven
courts
of
appeals,
i
should
mention,
have...
have
read
the
decision
that
way,
and
our
logic
has
been
described
as
irreproachable.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--there's
probably
a
good...
a
good
argument
to
that
effect.
what
usually
happens
is
that...
is
that
redactions
are
done
and
the
information
is
sanitized
and
turned
over
in
sanitized
fashion,
and
that's
usually
satisfactory
to
the
unions.
in
addition,
you
can
make
an
argument
that...
that
some
of
the
information
unions
request
tells
you
something
about
what
the
government
is
up
to,
some
of
it
is
available
under
the
routine-use
exception.
and,
of
course,
if
the
person
to
whom
the
information
relates
consents,
the
information
is
turned
over.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
so
this
parade
of
horribles
was
quite
exaggerated.
there
are
many
ways
unions
get
this
information.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
right.
that...
well,
they
get
deference
under...
under
section
7114
of
the
federal
labor
relations
statute,
but
that
leads
you
right
to
the
privacy
act.
they
don't
get
deference
in
construing
the
privacy
act,
which
is
what
directs
you
to
foia,
or
under
foia.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
hadn't
actually
looked
at
their
argument
that
way,
but
if
what
they're
really
trying
to
do...
and
i
guess
this
is
what
they're
really
trying
to
do,
is
read
a
thirteenth
exception
into
the
privacy
act,
and
deference
won't
carry
them
that
far.
thank
you.
