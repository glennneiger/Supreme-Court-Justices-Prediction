mr.
david
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
most
important
thing
this
court
should
bear
in
mind
today
is
that
this
is
a
case
which
arose
under
the
federal
sector
labor
management
relations
statute,
and
not
the
freedom
of
information
act.
this
case
involves--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--justice
stevens.
mr.
david
m.
smith
justice
stevens,
when
unions
have
tried
to
do
that,
the
courts
have
uniformly
said
no.
there's
a
cased
cited
in
our
brief
in
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--if
the
request
is
made
purely
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
as
opposed
to
under
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute
where
the
request
was
made
in
this
case,
the
courts
have
said
no.
there
are
two
cases
available.
mr.
david
m.
smith
how
do
we
get
around
the
language
of
the
privacy
act?
mr.
david
m.
smith
we
get
around
it
by
remembering
where
this
case
emanates.
this
case
is
first
and
foremost
a
federal
sector
labor
relations
case.
only
one
entity
in
the
world
can
make
a
request
for
information
under
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute.
when
they
make
that
request,
the
statute
admittedly
does
direct
you
to
whether
or
not
the
information
is
prohibited
by
law.
but
when
you
go
to
these
other
sources,
specifically
the
privacy
act
and,
in
turn,
the
freedom
of
information
act,
you
cannot
forget
where
you
started.
you
must
at
all
times
keep
in
mind
that
the
request
emanated
under
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute.
mr.
david
m.
smith
several
reasons,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
begin
with,
research
has
revealed
no
other
statute
comparable
to
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute
which
directs
you
through
the
privacy
act
to
the
freedom
of
information
act.
so
we're
not
talking
about
opening
freedom
of
information
act
law,
if
you
will,
to
a
broad
range
of
exceptions.
secondly,
within
the
four
corners
of
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute,
we
have
articulated
a
specified
congressional
interest
in
collective
bargaining
and
in
federal
sector
unions.
these
interests
must
be
balanced
when
contemplating
whether
or
not--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--we
take
exception
to
the
notion...
and,
indeed,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
only
addresses
that
the
federal
sector
unions
do
not
have
are
those
of
employees
who
have
chosen
not
to
provide
them.
indeed,
there
are
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
a
federal
sector
union
might
not
have
the
name
and
address
of
a
federal
sector
employee.
for
instance,
a
new
employee
coming
on
board
might
not
yet
have
provided
their
name
to
the
union.
in
this
very
case,
the
union
represents...
the
afge
local
represents
70
bargaining
units
at
worldwide
locations.
it
defies
logic
to
presume
that
the
union's
been
able
to
contact
every
one
of
those
unions
at
70
different
worldwide
locations
and
obtain
their
name
and
home
address.
some
employees
are
apathetic.
some
may
be
reluctant
to
provide
the
union
with
their
name
and
home
address.
some
may
not
want
to
pay
dues.
there
are
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
an
employee
might
not
provide
a
union
with
a
name
and
home
address,
but
there's
no
support
in
this
case
for
the
notion
that
the
solicitor
general
urges,
that
employees
who've
not
provided
them
don't
want
to
provide
them.
mr.
david
m.
smith
indeed,
it
would.
i
think
the
most
important
thing
this
court
should
keep
in
mind
is
that
this
is
a
federal
sector
labor
relations
case.
the
authority
in
this
case
concluded
that
the
bargaining...
that
the
defense
agencies
committed
unfair
labor
practices
when
they
refused
to
turn
over
the
names
and
home
addresses
of
employees
in
bargaining
units
represented
by
the
two
locals
concerned.
mr.
david
m.
smith
justice
scalia,
we
agree
that
federal
employees
have
a
privacy
interest.
but
it's
important
to
remember
that
congress
never
contemplated
that
federal
employees
would
be
able
to
prevent
unconsented
to
disclosure
of
private-in-nature
information.
in
fact,
at
the
time
that
the
privacy
act
was
passed
in
1974,
the
state
of
the
law
was
that
names
and
home
addresses
were
being
released
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
secondly,
that
congress
has
articulated
a
privacy
act
and
has
drafted
and
enacted
a
freedom
of
act,
does
not
lead
inescapably
to
the
conclusion
that
you
should
ignore
the
considerations
in
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute
in
evaluating
whether
or
not
disclosure
would
prevail
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
congress
enacted
the
federal
labor
relations
act,
as
this
court
found
in
1983
in
its
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
case,
in...
in
enacting
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute,
this
court
found
that
it
was
modeled
after
the
national
labor
relations
act.
at
the
time
that
the
civil
service
reform
act
was
passed
in
the
late
seventies,
the
state
of
the
law
was
that
names
and
home
addresses
were
being
provided
to
private
sector
unions.
mr.
david
m.
smith
no,
sir,
nothing...
nothing
in
line
with
the
privacy
act.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
we
don't
contend
that
they
are
mirror
images,
but
there's
no
salient
public
policy
reason
why
you
would
discriminate
in
this
case,
why
you
would
allow
to
private
sector
unions
a
tool
which
this
court
has
recognized
they
need,
but
deny
the
same
to
federal--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--justice
o'connor,
we
think
the
language
of
the
statute
holds
us
in
good
stead
in
this
case.
the
language
of
the
statute
where
we
ultimately
wind
up
if
you
speak
to
the
freedom
of
information
act,
is
that
disclosure
will
attend,
absent
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
we
do
not
see
the
release
of
federal
sector
employees'
name
and
home
address
as
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
public...
personal
privacy.
mr.
david
m.
smith
we
don't
think
you
do.
and
if
you'd
permit
me,
i'd
like
to
say
why.
in
the
context
of
the
reporters
committee
decision,
this
court
identified
a
specific
public
interest
which
must
be
considered
in
a
freedom
of
information
act
context.
this
court
declined
to
allow
courts
to
consider
an
amorphous
public
opinion...
public
interest,
but
instead
specified
a
specific
interest
of
what
the
government
is
up
to
as
being
the
specific
interest.
that
was
the
case
where
the
request
was
a
freedom
of
information
act
request.
there's
no
freedom
of
information
act
request
in
this
case.
that
was
a
case
where
the
information
sought
were
fbi
rap
sheets,
obviously
an
item
which
this
court
said
was
clearly
embarrassing.
here
we
seek
names
and
home
addresses,
i
submit
to
you
a
much
less
intrusive
invasion.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
we
would...
as
a
fallback
position,
we
would
contend
as
much.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
we
think
it
more
important
that
this
court
recognize
the
importance
of
collective
bargaining
considerations
in
evaluating
whether
or
not
federal
sector
unions
obtain
information.
mr.
david
m.
smith
indeed--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
and
we
would...
we
would
contend
to
this
court--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--i
think
that's
a
good
articulation
of
our
position,
justice
ginsburg.
the
point
seems
to
be
that
you
don't...
simply
because
you
look
to
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
we
admit
that
you
do,
in
fact,
ultimately
look
to
the
freedom
of
information
act,
you
do
not
turn
this
into
a
foia
request.
remember
that
we're--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--that
is
exactly
our
point.
the...
there's
only
one
entity,
one
that's
already
been
granted
exclusive
recognition
stature
by
the
federal
labor
relations
authority,
that's
entitled
to
make
a
request
for
information
under
the
federal
labor
relations
statute.
so--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--at
page
771
of
your
reporters
committee
opinion,
justice
scalia,
the
court
said:
"the
identity
of
the
requesting
party
has
no
bearing
upon
the
merits
of
his
or
her
foia
request.
"
that's
where
we
draw
the
line.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
freedom
of
information
act
request.
we
look
to
the
foia,
we
adapt
foia,
but
we
don't
turn
a
request
for
information
under
a
statute
created
by
congress
into
a
foia
case.
mr.
david
m.
smith
our
position
is
we
don't
need
to
look
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
in
this
case.
mr.
david
m.
smith
i'll
try
once
more
to
save
both
positions
and
then
abandon
one
if
i
have
to.
[laughter]
first
and
foremost,
disclosure
should
attend
here
because
the
request
for
information
is
made
under
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute.
failing
that,
if
we
treat
this
case
as
a
pure
freedom
of
information
act
case,
which
the
solicitor
general
urges
this
court
to
do,
we
feel
like
the
invasion
of
privacy
is
not
so
significant
that
the
information
shouldn't
be
released
in
any
event.
mr.
david
m.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
smith
the
court
engaged
in
traditional
exemption
6
balancing
in
the
two
cases
that
i'm
familiar
with.
specifically
the
afge--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--yes,
it
did,
and
in
those
cases
determined
that
the
invasion
of
privacy
outweighed
the
public
interest.
which
i
think
goes
to
make
our
point
in
this
case,
justice
souter.
because
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
the
court
specifically,
under
a
freedom
of
information
act
request,
said
that
this
information
is
not
available,
4
years
later
the
exact
same
request
was
made
by
the
exact
same
local,
a
baltimore
social
security
outfit,
to
the
exact
same
agency
of
government,
health
and
human
services,
and
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
itself
and
said
now
the
request
comes
under
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute,
we
will
provide
the
information
to
the
other
side.
so
when
you
properly
balance
collective
bargaining
considerations,
the
information
will
be
disclosed.
but
when
you
treat
this
case
as
a
pure
foia
case,
it's
tougher...
it's
tougher,
indeed,
to
justify
release
because
you
can't
consider
the
very
real
significant
interest
which
attends
in
federal
sector
collective
bargaining
and
federal
sector
unions.
it's
important
to
realize
the
ramifications
of
this
case
go
beyond
mere
names
and
home
addresses.
the
government
would
have
you
adopt
the
what
the
government
is
up
to
standard,
the
pure
reporters
committee
standard,
to
every
single
request
for
information
that
a
federal
sector
union
makes.
if
you
take
a
fairly
simple
scenario,
let's
suppose
two
employees
both
receive
a
performance
evaluation.
one
is
dissatisfied
with
his
performance
evaluation,
feels
as
though
union
animus
had
something
to
do
with
that.
he
is...
so
let's
say
an
active
member
of
a
union,
a
coworker
is
not.
he
goes
to
his
union
and
complains.
the
union
makes
a
request
under
the
labor
statute
for
the
performance
evaluation
of
the
other
employee
in
order
to
do
a
comparison
and
see
if,
in
fact,
there
has
been
discriminatory
treatment.
the
government
would
tell
you
that
the
personnel
office
of
the
agency
concerned
cannot
turn
this
document
over
unless
that
particular
performance
appraisal
of,
shall
we
say,
a
low-level
clerk
tells
you
what
the
government's
up
to.
i
submit
to
you
that
makes
no
sense.
that's
not
what
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
perhaps
it
would,
but
that's
a
pretty
rigorous
standard
in
every
request
for--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--if...
if
the...
if
that's
true,
that
would
be
fine.
but
i
would
cite
to
you
the
case
of
the
department
of
commerce
v.
the
flra
decided
in
1992
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
not
a
case
particularly
different
from
the
hypothetical
i
just
gave
you.
the
authority
had
ordered
the
release
of
a
dozen...
of
a
selected
group
of
performance
appraisals,
people
that...
the
list
of
names
of
people
who
had
received
outstanding
performance
appraisals.
the
union
was
wanting
to
pursue
a
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
disparate
treatment
was
occurring
and
to
monitor
the
performance
appraisal
system
of
a
given
agency.
the
authority
ordered
release.
in
so
doing,
the
authority
noted
this
court's
1967
acme
industrial
company
precedent
that
release
of
information
in
a
situation
like
this
leads
to
the
early
resolution
of
grievances.
the
authority
was
reversed
by
the
d.c.
circuit,
who
said
this
information
doesn't
tell
you
a
whole
lot
about
what
an
agency
of
government
is
up
to.
so
it's
a
situation,
justice
souter,
where
the
courts
are
doing
just
that.
if
they're
gonna
apply
reporters
committee
in
a
strict
myopic
fashion,
union
requests
for
information
done
to
sort
through
and
sift
out
and
determine
whether
grievances
are
unmeritorious
are
going
to
dry
up,
and
what
we're
going
to
get
to
is
unions
are
not
going
to
have--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--the
solicitor
general
notes
in
their
xx
that
that
is,
in
fact,
the
answer.
i
submit
to
you
that
employees
might
be
reluctant
to
provide
that
information.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
he--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--no.
i'm
suggesting
that
in
attempting
to
obtain
a
performance
appraisal
of
the
other
employee--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--the
one
who's
been
complained
about,
that
employee
would
not
be
likely
to
provide
consent.
mr.
david
m.
smith
i'd
like
to
respond
to
your
first
point
and
then
answer
your
second
question,
if
i
could,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
m.
smith
we
don't
agree
it's
a
pretty
limited
category.
any
requests
for
information
that
would
in
any
way
involve
a
system
of
records
implicated
by
the
privacy
act
would,
in
fact,
fall
within
the
hypothetical
situation
that
i
depicted
to
you.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
i
would
disagree
with
you,
but
let
me
turn
to
the
second
point.
with
respect
to
routine
use,
the
government
would
tell
you
that
routine
use
is
the
panacea
to
this
problem.
the
court
should,
however,
examine
that
point
very
closely.
if
routine
use
were
available
to
solve
our
problem,
we
wouldn't
have
litigated
this
case
for
the
past
7
years
from
one
end
of
this
country
to
the
other.
they
have
said
that
while
routine-use
available,
it's
not
available
in
this
particular
case
because
there
are
alternative
means
of
obtaining
the
information.
also,
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
routine-use
wouldn't
assist--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--with
respect--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--it
already
has
been
declared
a
routine-use.
however,
it
is
up
to
the
agency
of
government
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
union
needs
the
information,
whether
it's
relevant
and
necessary
for
the
union
prosecuting
the
grievance.
so
we're
placing
the
agencies
of
government
under
the
routine-use
exemption...
i'm
sorry,
exception
to
the
privacy
act,
in
the
position
of
determining
what
it
is
the
unions
get.
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
already
a
routine-use
which
authorizes
the
release
of
names
and
home
addresses
to
federal
sector
collective
bargaining
units.
however,
as
with
the
wording
in
the
other
routine-use,
it's
up
to
the
agencies
of
government
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
information
is
relevant
and
necessary.
so--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--under
the
routine-use
exemption,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
smith
yes,
they
have.
i
remind
you
once
again
of
the
case
that
i
cited
earlier,
federal
labor
relations
authority
v.
department
of
commerce,
where
what
the
union
sought
were
performance
appraisals
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
performance
appraisal
system
was
being
fairly
run
in
one
particular
agency
of
government.
admittedly,
that's
a
bit
broader
than
a
one-at-a-time
case,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
agencies
have
used
the
routine-use
to
deny
information
to
unions
and
they
continue
to
do
it.
and
remember,
the
wording
of
the
routine-use
is
such
that
it's
totally
up
to
the
agencies
to
determine
sort
of
as
a
benevolent
godfather,
if
you
will,
what
it
is
they
will
provide
the
federal
sector
unions
and
what
it
is
they
will
not
provide
the
federal
sector
unions.
mr.
david
m.
smith
well,
it
has...
it
has
been
fought
a
good
deal.
but
i
think
it
important
to
recall
this
is
not
a
routine-use
case.
mr.
david
m.
smith
you're
right,
justice
ginsburg.
in
fact--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--well,
the
flra's
position
was,
at
the
time
that
it
issued
its
decision
in
1990
in
its
portsmouth
naval
shipyard
case
decision,
that
this
information
was
discloseable
as
a
routine-use.
that
position
has
ultimately
been
taken
away
from
the
authority
by
the
publishing
in
september
of
1992
of
fpm
letter
711-164,
wherein
the
office
of
personnel
management
specify
how
the
routine-use
should
be
construed
in
this
particular
case.
getting
to
your
larger
point,
however,
we
think
it
counterintuitive
for
agencies
to
suggest
on
the
one
hand
that
federal
sector
employees
have
a
significant
privacy
interest
in
not
disclosing
the
names
and
home
addresses
of
federal
employees,
yet
acknowledging
at
the
same
time
that
they
could
change
the
routine-use
in
the
morning
and
disclose
this
very
information.
indeed,
under
current
fpm
letter
17...
the
fpm
letter
i
referenced
earlier,
the
information
can
be
disclosed.
the
privacy
interest
can
be
overrun
if
the
agency
concludes
that
the
union...
union
does
not
have
alternative
means
of
obtaining
the
information.
so
i
agree
with
your
point.
mr.
david
m.
smith
i
think
your
point
is
well
taken,
that
perhaps
the
law
could
be
better
written
in
that
guard...
regard.
but
it
does
sort
of
question
the
issue
of
how
significant
the
privacy
interest
is
in
this
particular
case,
justice
scalia.
a
couple
of
points
were
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
opening
argument
that
i'd
like
to
respond
to.
justice
scalia,
you
raised
the
point
about
whether
or
not
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
a
policy
on
names
and
home
addresses
and
could
that
be
changed.
it
could
be
changed.
the
excelsior
underwear
case
could
be
changed,
but
they
would
have
to
overrule
the
precedent
of
this
court.
your
wyman
and
gordon
decision
in
1969
specifically
enforced
the
excelsior
underwear
case
and
provided
that
names
and
home
addresses--
mr.
david
m.
smith
--the
latter,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
m.
smith
i
would
say
the
board
is
pretty
well
frozen
on
the
release
of
names
and
home
addresses
issue,
absent
a
change
in
the
opinion
of
this
particular
court.
it's
not
just
this
court
that's
gone
that
far.
following
your
wyman
and
gordon
decision,
courts
of
appeal
for
the
first,
second,
and
ninth
circuits
have
also
said
that
names
and
home
addresses
will
have
to
be
released
to
unions.
so
the
board
would
have
a
significant
uphill
battle
in
turning
around
that
position.
mr.
david
m.
smith
we
do
know
that
at
the
time
the
federal
sector
labor
management
relations
statute
was
enacted,
the
policy
clearly
was
and
had
been
for
some
10
years
that
names
and
home
addresses
were
released.
we
do
know,
as
found
by
this
court,
that
the
federal
sector
labor
management
relations
statute
was
modeled
after
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
the
authority
was
modeled
after
the
national
labor
relations
board.
admittedly,
there's
no
specific
proviso.
mr.
david
m.
smith
absolutely.
which
is
what
this
court
pretty
much
said
in
your
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
case
in
1983,
that
the
authority
is
entitled
to
deference
within...
when
it
acts
within
the
provisions
of
the
federal
sector
labor
management
relations
statute.
and
this
certainly
is
a
matter
which
affects
federal
sector
labor
relations,
whether
or
not
federal
employee
unions
are
able
to
receive
this
information.
which
every
court
of
appeal
has
said
is
vital
to
the
interest
of
the
unions.
that
it's
the
most
effective,
efficient
means
of
dealing
with...
with
their
employees,
and
it's
an
effective
means
of
communication.
that
really
is
not
a
point
that's
in
dispute.
the
only
dispute
is
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
provide
federal
sector
unions
with
a
tool
they
need
to
contact
their
employees
to
facilitate
collective
bargaining
in
the
federal
workplace.
in
conclusion,
we
ask
that
this
court
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
a
federal
sector
labor
relations
case,
not
a
request
for
information
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
congress
has
specifically
declared
its
support
for
the
public
interest
in
collective
bargaining
and
federal
sector
labor
organizations.
the
decision
of
this
court
should
protect
and
honor
the
interests
so
specified
by
congress.
this
court
should
uphold
the
authority's
harmonizing
of
the
privacy
act,
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute,
and
not
allow
the
federal
sector
labor
relations
statute
to
be
trumped
by
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
dry
up
the
information
which
federal
sector
unions
need
to
do
their
job.
recognizing
the
importance
of
collective
bargaining
in
considering
and
analyzing
information
requests
does
minimal
harm
to
the
private
interests
of
federal
sector
employees,
gives
import
to
the
public
interest
in
collective
bargaining,
and
is
supported
by
this
court's
prior
decisions.
the
authority
asks
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed
and
its
orders
be
enforced.
thank
you.
