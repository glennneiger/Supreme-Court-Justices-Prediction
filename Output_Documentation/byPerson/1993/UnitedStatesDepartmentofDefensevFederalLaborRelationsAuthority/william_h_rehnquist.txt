we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
92-1223,
united
states
department
of
defense
v.
federal
labor
relations
authority.
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wright.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
so,
mr.
smith?
i
presume
that
almost
every
sort
of
request
for
information
to
which
the
privacy
applies...
privacy
act
applies
comes
under
some
other
statute
or
some
other
interest.
why
should
this
particular
source
be
more
important
than
other
sources?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
bargain
collectively
without
having
the
names
of
employees
who
don't
want
to
give...
without
the
union
having
the
names
of
employees
who
don't
want
to
give
their
names
to
the
union.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
your
request
would
cover
that
kind
of
employees.
you're
saying
it
would
cover
other
employees
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
doesn't
answer
the
question.
i
mean,
of
course
it's
a
federal
sector
labor
relations
case
and
it's
a...
it's
a
labor
relations
request.
but
the
argument
being
made
is
in
this
very
field
congress
said
you
get
what
you're
entitled
to,
except
the
privacy
act
has
to
be
complied
with.
and
the
privacy
act
says
there's
an
exception
for
anything
that
has
to
be
disclosed
under
foia.
so
it
is
a
federal
case,
labor
relations
case,
but
the
issue
is
what
has
congress
provided
for
in
this
area.
and
if
you...
if
you
walk
that
progression
through,
they've
provided
that
federal
employees
have
a
privacy
interest
except
to
the
extent
there's
an
exception
from
foia,
because
of
foia.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
wyman
and
gordon
indicate
that
the
board
would
have
had
to
reach
that
result,
or
just
that
it
was
a
permissible
conclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
would
you
say
we
would
have
to
overrule
wyman
and
gordon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
wright,
you
have
9
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
the
case
is
submitted.
