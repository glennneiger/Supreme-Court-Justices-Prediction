justice
antonin
scalia
i
took
it
to
be
one
of
the
bases
of
our
decision
in
reporters
committee
that
the
personnel
at
agencies
who
have
to
deal
with
foia
requests
cannot
be
expected
to
inquire
into
the
individuated
needs
of
each
requester.
and
so
you
have
to
decide
it
on
an
in
gross
basis,
should
the
public
at
large.
now,
assuming...
assuming
that
that's
correct,
would
it
make
an
enormous
exception
from
that
to
say,
well,
we
won't
consider
the
individuated
needs
of
the
public
at
large,
but
we
will
consider
policies
that
are
set
forth
in
federal
statutes.
how
much
of
a
big
exception
would
that
be
to
the
policy
we
were
trying
to
further
in
reporters
committee?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
other
statutes
would
be
called
into
play,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
many?
i
haven't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
suppose
that
the...
that
the
inconvenience
or
the
impracticality
for
the...
for
the
foia
processor
is
not
simply
the
number
of
statutes,
but
rather
the
necessity
of
figuring
out
who
the
requestor
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
there
are
only
a
few
statutes,
you
would
add
to
the
foia
process
the
necessity
of
determining
that
this
is,
indeed,
a
labor
union
or
a
labor
union
officer,
or
whatever
other
individual
is
the
beneficiary
of
one
particular
federal
statute
or
another,
whereas
currently
you
don't
have
to
know
who
the
requestor
is.
it
doesn't
matter
what
his
name
is,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
find
it
very
appealing
as
a
privacy
act
case,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
mr.
wright.
i,
you
know...
i've
been
talking
about
it
as
a
foia
case
only
because
the
privacy
act
exception
refers
you
to
foia.
and
so
thereafter
you
analyze
it
like
a
foia
case.
but
if
it's...
if
you're
just
appealing
to
privacy
interests,
i
find
it
really
very
strange
that
the
federal
government
should
not
allow
to
be
obtained
from
federal
employees
what
it
requires
to
be
provided
from
non-federal
employees.
i
mean,
if
anything,
you
would
think
that
federal
employees
would
be...
certainly
in
other
areas
federal
employees
have
less
privacy
than
private
citizens,
and
you're
telling
us
that
we
have
a
statute
here
which
gives
more
privacy
to
federal
employees
than
to
private
citizens,
because
a
private
citizen,
his
address
is
obtainable
by
a
labor
union.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
congress...
in
the
private
sector
area,
is
it
a
provision
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
unions
have
to
provided
with
the
home
addresses
of
employees?
or
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a
determination--
justice
antonin
scalia
--probably
not
by
rulemaking,
but
by
adjudication,
right,
of
the
national
labor
relations
board?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
presumably
you
think...
do
you
think...
do
you
think
the
national
labor
relations
board
might
come
out
the
other
way
on
that
subject
and
still...
and
still
be
upheld
by
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
there's
enough
of
a
privacy
interest
on
the
part
of...
on
the
part
of
private
citizens,
that
their
home
addresses
should
not
be
given
by
private
sector...
to
private
sector--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
they
did,
do
you
think
it
would
contravene
the
federal
labor
relations
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
the
national
labor
relations
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can't
really
say
that
there
is
a
congressional
policy
in
the
private
sector
that
would
permit
what
we
are...
would
not
be
permitting
here
if
we
took
your
position.
you
wouldn't
really
say
that
there's
a
labor
board
policy
in
that
area.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
the
federal...
does
the
national
labor
relations
act
have
a
privacy
guarantee
for
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this...
but
the
federal
labor
relations
act
does
have
it,
so
to
that
extent
it's
not
modeled
after
the
nlra.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
"clearly
unwarranted"
can
take
account
of
that
individuating
characteristic,
why
should
it
not
take
account
of
all
individuating
characteristics?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
contrary
to
the
whole
letter
and
spirit
of
reporters
committee.
we
say
away
with
individuating
characteristics,
and
you're
coming
and
saying,
well,
we're
just
not
any
requester
under
foia,
we
are
a
labor
union,
and
we're
requesting
under
this
federal
statute
here.
it
seems
to
me
you're
in
the
soup
and
you
convert
all
foia
requests
into
requests
that
have
to
looked
at
in
light
of
who
the
requester
is.
i
don't
know
why...
why
that
principle
should
not
apply
across
the
board.
how
do
you...
how
do
you
just
say
only
in
this
case
are
we
going
to
take
account
of
individuation?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
just
changed
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
early
question,
then.
you
don't
any
longer
assert
that
you
could
get
it
under
foia
alone,
or
else
you'd
have
to
give
me
a
different
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
you
don't
need
to.
but
either
change
your
answer
to
my
question
or
abandon
your
earlier
fallback
argument
that
you
should
get
it
under
foia
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
all
grievances.
it's
that
limited
category
of
grievance
where
what
you're
talking
about
is
somebody
else
got
a
promotion
when...
or
i
got
fired
when
the
other
one...
or
demoted
when
the
other
one
didn't.
that's
a
pretty
limited
category.
what
about
the
routine-use
exemption,
having
it
simply
declared
a
routine-use?
couldn't
the...
couldn't
the
union
seek
to
get
the
agency
to
declare
such
a
use
a
routine-use?
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-hum.
justice
antonin
scalia
no...
not
within
a
hypothetical
where
the
person
effected
would
not
be
entirely
willing
to
give
his
consent.
i
mean
most
of
your
grievances,
it
seems
to
me,
will
involve
situations
where
the
union...
where
the
employee
will
be
perfectly
willing
to
say
i
waive
my
privacy
act
rights.
the
only...
the
only
situation
you're
in
trouble
is
where
you
need
information...
in
order
to
pursue
this
grievance,
you
need
information
about
another
employee
who
may
not
be
willing
to
waive
it.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
not
the...
not
the...
not
the
majority
of
situations,
a
relatively
small
minority
of
situations.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i'm
talking
about
routine
use
of
personnel
records,
not
routine
use
of
employees'
addresses.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
quite
right.
you
have
an
uphill
battle
to
get
it
declared
a
routine-use
of
employees'
addresses
that
they
be
given
out.
but
just
as
far
as
prosecuting
grievances
is
concerned,
you
could
not
have
it
declared
a
routine-use
of
personnel
information
to
give
it
to
a
union
prosecuting
a
grievance?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
really
can't
say
you
don't
get
anything
in
this
grievance
situation.
you're
just
saying
you
don't
get
it
if
the
agency
makes
the
determination
that
you
don't
need
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
you
can
get
it
whenever
the
agency
agrees
with
you
that
you
need
it
to
prosecute
your
grievance.
how
could
any
agency
possibly
say
that
when
your
grievance
is
a
comparative
grievance
like
this,
you've
received
discriminatory
treatment...
how
could
any
agency
policy...
possibly
say
that
you
don't
need
it
in
order
to
compare
it
to
the
other
employees?
have
some
done
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to...
you
ought
to
fight
that
out
on
the
proper...
on
the
proper
field,
and
that
is
on
the
field
of
whether
that's
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
routine-use
exemption
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
the
hypocrisy
of
the
government.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
way
that...
that's
the
way
foia
is
written.
i
mean,
if
that
is...
if
that
is
something
of
an
irony,
it's
an
irony
that's...
that's
within
the
privacy
act.
once
it's
declared
a
routine-use,
despite
all
your
privacy
interests
in
it,
it's
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're...
i'm
sorry,
chief.
go
ahead.
i...
my
only
point
on
it
was
you're
quite
correct,
it
is
a
federal
policy,
but
it
is
not
a
congressionally
enunciated
policy.
i'm
just
suggesting
your
point
would
be
a
lot
stronger
if
the
labor
relations...
if
the
national
labor
relations
act
said,
congress
said
unions
need
employees
addresses.
and
then
the
very
same
congress...
well,
what
we
call
the
very
same
congress
enacts
the
federal
labor
relations
act.
then
you
could
say,
gee,
they
couldn't
have
both
of
these
things
in
mind
at
the
same
time.
but,
in
fact,
we
don't
know
what
congress
thought
about
this.
we
don't
know
what
congress
thinks
about
it
today,
what
it
thinks
about
providing
employees
addresses
even
in
the
private
sector.
you
still
have
an
argument
that
it's
a
federal
policy,
but
you
cannot
make
the
argument
that
it
is
a
congressionally
mandated
policy.
it's
a
policy
that
congress
let
the
board
adopt.
justice
antonin
scalia
information
is
releasable
or
not
releasable.
it's
not...
it's
not
releasable
to...
if
it's
releasable
to
any
individual
under
foia,
it's
releasable
to
the
public
at
large,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wright,
could
i
ask
about
deference.
there...
there
are
two
arguments
being
made
here
by
the
labor
board.
one
is
that
the
statute
does
not,
as
you
say,
refer
everything
to
foia.
that
it...
it
refers
it
to
foia
but
with
something
of
its
own
in
it.
and
the
other
argument
is
that
even
under
foia,
they...
simpliciter,
they
ought
to
get
it.
now,
as
to
the
latter,
i
think
you've...
the
argument
in
your
brief
that
no
deference
is
owed
is
quite
correct.
but
as
to
the
former,
don't
you
have
to
give
deference?
i
mean
isn't
your
argument
as
to
the
former,
yes,
we
owe
them
deference
but
this
goes
beyond
the
scope
of
the
reasonable,
and
therefore
the
deference
doesn't
carry
us
that
far?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
deference
in
making
the
argument
that
this
doesn't...
doesn't
adopt
the
privacy
act
unamended.
it
puts
into
the
privacy
act
when
you're
making
your
request
under
the
labor
statute,
this...
this
modification.
that's
the
argument
they're
making.
and
the
only
response
to
that,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
be,
well,
yes,
you're...
you
know,
there's
deference,
but
fun's
fun,
but
you
can't
die
laughing.
that's
your
argument.
