the

no.
92-1223,
united
states
department
of
defense
versus
federal
labor
relations
authority.
it
is
before
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
two
labor
unions
requested
the
petition
of
federal
agencies
to
provide
them
with
the
home
addresses
of
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
units
represented
by
the
unions.
the
agencies
refused.
the
respondent
federal
labor
relations
authority,
ordered
the
agencies
to
divulge
the
addresses.
the
court
of
appeals
granted
enforcement
of
the
authority's
orders
agreeing
that
disclosure
was
not
barred
by
the
privacy
act
of
1974
and
holding
that
the
federal
service
labor-management
relations
statute,
which
i
will
refer
to
as
the
labor
statute
required
the
agencies
to
release
the
addresses.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
due
to
several
statutory
cross-references
disclosure
of
the
addresses
sought
under
the
labor
statute
is
forbidden
in
this
case
by
the
privacy
act
unless
such
disclosure
would
be
required
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
foia.
intern,
disclosure
would
be
requiring
under
foia
unless
it
falls
within
foia
exemption
6,
which
exempts
from
disclosure
personnel
files,
the
disclosure
of
which
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
in
deciding
whether
exemption
6
applies,
we
must
weigh
the
relevant
public
interest
in
disclosure
against
the
employees'
interest
in
keeping
their
home
addresses
private.
the
appropriate
public
interest
to
be
weighed
in
this
balance
is
the
extent
to
which
disclosure
would
serve
foia's
core
purpose
of
contributing
significantly
to
public
understanding
of
the
government's
operations
and
activities.
under
our
precedents
the
public
interest
in
collective
bargaining
embodied
in
the
labor
statute
is
irrelevant
in
this
analysis.
in
this
case,
the
public
interest
and
disclosure
is
negligible
at
best
because
disclosure
of
the
home
addresses
would
not
appreciably
further
the
citizen's
right
to
know
what
their
government
is
up
to.
on
the
other
hand,
the
employees
have
at
least
some
non
trivial
privacy
interest
in
non
disclosure
and
in
avoiding
the
influx
of
union
related
mail
and
perhaps
the
union
related
telephone
calls
or
visits
that
would
follow
such
disclosure.
because
the
privacy
interest
outweighs
the
relevant
public
interest,
foia
exemption
6
applies.
foia
thus,
does
not
require
the
petitioners
to
disclose
the
addresses
and
the
privacy
acts
prohibits
their
release.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
