well
the
reason...
the
reason
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're
arguing
that
congress
should
have
written
the
statute
differently,
and
isn't
that
for
congress
to
decide.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
have
to
view
it
in
the
context
of
the
reporters
committee
decision,
i
suppose.
