why
does
that...
why
does
that
follow?
i
mean
if
it's
discloseable
to
unions,
presumably
it's
because
the
weighing
process
is
giving
effect
to
federal
statutory
policy.
that
is
not
going
to
affect
a
request
from
somebody
off
the
street.
justice
david
h.

mr.
smith,
you
had
said
earlier,
i
guess
in
answering
justice
stevens'
question,
as
i
understood
you,
not
that
you
did
not
believe
that
you
were
entitled
to
get
it
if
you
asked
under
foia,
but
simply
that
the
courts
had
not
been
giving
it
to
you
under
foia.
they
had...
they
had
denied
your...
the
requests
under
foia,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
were
the
rationales
in
the...
in
those
cases
for
refusing
the
requests
under
foia?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
it
bring
the
privacy
act
concern
into
the
balance?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
that
tell
you
what
the
government's
up
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
i
mean,
if
it
would,
then
your
parade
of
horribles
is
short
by
at
least
one
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
result...
you
had
a
good
adjective
there.
[laughter]
is
the...
is
the
result
going
to
be
the
same
in
mr.
smith's
hypothetical
in
which
the
request
for
the
information
is
to
determine
whether...
whether
union
members
are
getting
performance
evaluations
which,
because
of
their
union
membership,
are
unfavorable?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
suggested
to
him
that
that
purpose,
at
least,
was...
was,
indeed,
to
find
out
what
the
government
is
up
to.
would
you
agree
that
they're
entitled
to
it
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
