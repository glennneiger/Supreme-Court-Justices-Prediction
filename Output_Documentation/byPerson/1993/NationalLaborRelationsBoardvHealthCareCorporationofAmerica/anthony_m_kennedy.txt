justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
the
opinion
to
announce
for
the
court
in
national
relations
board
versus
the
healthcare
and
retirement
corporation
of
america,
no.
92-1964.
the
national
labor
relations
act
affords
employees
the
right
to
organize
and
the
right
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
free
from
any
employer
and
insurance.
the
act
does
not
grant
those
rights
to
supervisory
employees
however,
and
that
means
that
the
statutory
definition
of
supervisor
becomes
essential
in
determining
which
employees
are
covered
by
the
act.
this
case
presents
the
narrow
question
whether
the
board's
rulings
were
consistent
with
the
statutory
definition
when
it
adapted
a
test
for
determining
if
a
nurse
is
a
supervisor.
the
act
states
that
any
individual
who
uses
independent
judgment
in
performing
one
of
twelve
supervisory
functions
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
is
a
supervisor.
this
case
turns
on
the
statutory
phrase,
in
the
interest
of
the
employer.
in
cases
involving
nurses,
the
board
has
stated
that
a
nurse's
direction
of
less
skilled
employees
incidental
to
the
treatment
of
the
patients
is
not
authority
exercised
in
the
interest
of
the
employer.
this
case
involves
four
nurses
employed
at
the
heartland
nursing
home
in
urbana,
ohio.
heartland,
which
is
the
respondent
here,
had
contended
that
the
nurses
were
supervisors
and
so
were
not
covered
by
the
act.
the
board
disagreed
stating
that
the
focus
of
the
nurse's
activity
was
on
the
well-being
of
the
nursing
home
residents.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
board's
test
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
phrase,
in
the
interest
of
the
employer,
and
ruled
in
favor
of
respondents.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm.
the
board
has
created
a
full
septotomy
between
acts
taken
in
connection
with
patient
care
and
acts
taken
in
the
interest
of
the
employer.
patient
care
is
the
business
of
the
nursing
home.
it
follows
that
attending
to
the
needs
of
the
nursing
home
patients,
who
are
the
employer's
customers,
is
in
the
interest
of
the
employer.
that
conclusion
is
supported
by
our
1980
decision
in
nlrb
versus
yeshiva
university
and
in
our
1947
decision
in
packard
motor
car
company
versus
nlrb.
because
the
board's
test
is
inconsistent
with
both
the
statutory
language
and
this
court's
precedents
the
board
put
forth
a
series
of
non-statutory
arguments
but
none
is
persuasive.
the
board
argues,
for
example,
that
granting
organizational
rights
to
nurses,
whose
supervisory
authority
concerns
patient
care,
does
not
threaten
the
conflicting
loyalties
that
the
supervisory
exception
were
designed
to
avoid.
the
act
must
be
enforced
according
to
its
own
terms,
however,
and
by
creating
legal
categories
inconsistent
with
its
meaning,
as
the
board
has
done
here,
is
impermissible.
we
hold
that
the
board's
test
for
determining
if
a
nurse
is
a
supervisor
is
inconsistent
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
she
has
joined
therein
by
justice
blackmun,
justice
stevens,
and
justice
souter.
