justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
punitive
damages
case.
the
petitioner
manufactured
and
sold
a
three-wheeled
all
terrain
vehicle
that
overturned
while
respondent
was
driving
it
causing
him
severe
and
permanent
injuries.
respondent
brought
suit
alleging
the
petitioner
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
vehicle
had
an
inherently
and
unreasonably
dangerous
design.
the
jury
found
petitioner
liable
and
awarded
respondent
almost
$1
million
in
compensatory
damages
and
punitive
damages
of
$5
million.
because
of
a
provision
of
the
oregon
constitution,
the
oregon
trial
and
appellate
courts
did
not
review
the
amount
of
punitive
damages
to
ensure
that
they
were
not
excessive
or
unreasonable.
petitioner
argued
that
our
prior
decisions
required
meaningful
judicial
review
to
prevent
arbitrary
impositions
of
large
punitive
damages,
but
the
oregon
supreme
court
rejected
that
argument
holding
that
judicial
review
was
not
constitutionally
required
and
that
other
oregon
procedures
ensured
against
arbitrary
awards.
we
now
reverse
and
remand.
judicial
review
of
the
amount
of
punitive
damage
awards
has
been
a
safeguard
against
excessive
awards
for
as
long
as
punitive
damages
have
been
awarded.
punitive
damages
pose
an
acute
danger
of
arbitrary
deprivation
of
property.
jury
instructions
typically
leave
the
jury
with
wide
discretion
in
choosing
amounts
in
the
presentation
of
evidence
of
a
defendant's
net
worth
creates
the
potential
that
juries
will
use
their
verdicts
to
express
biases
against
big
businesses
particularly
those
without
strong
local
presences.
judicial
review
of
the
amount
awarded
was
one
of
the
few
procedural
safeguards
which
the
common
law
provided
against
that
danger.
oregon
has
removed
that
safeguard
without
providing
an
adequate
substitute
and
without
any
indication
that
the
danger
of
arbitrary
awards
has
in
any
way
subsided
over
time.
for
these
reasons,
we
hold
that
oregon's
denial
of
judicial
review
of
the
size
of
punitive
damage
awards
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
