unknown
speaker
these
are
state
court
decisions
you're
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
what
standard
is
it
that
those
courts
use
in
assessing
punitive
damages?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
were
the
standards
employed
in
the
cases
you
were
reciting?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
standard
are
you
asserting
is
constitutionally
mandated,
mr.
frey?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
would
it
be
sufficient
for
a
state
to
say,
as
long
as
the
award
is
not
the
product
of
passion
or
prejudice,
it
is
not
excessive?
unknown
speaker
the
thing
about
punitive
damages
review,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
if
you're
reviewing
a
verdict
for
actual
damages
and
talk
about
passion
or
prejudice
or
the
weight
of
it,
you've
got
some
fairly
concrete
things
to
hang
on
to...
the
amount
of
the
medicals,
the
amount
of...
cost
of
maintaining
someone
who's
disabled...
but
the
punitive
damage
is
much,
much
harder
to
pin
down.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
what
are
the,
then...
you
said
you're
not
talking
about
substantive
limits
today.
what
are
the
procedural
limits?
you
have
not
answered
whether
passion
and
prejudice...
maybe
you
want
to
continue
that.
i
would
be
interested
in
knowing
whether
you
think
a
remittitur
device
is
constitutionally
required,
whether
you
think
it's
compatible
with
due
process
to
have
a
new
trial
limited
to
the
punitive
damages
only,
or
whether
you'd
have
to
have
an
entire
trial.
what
exactly
are
the
components
of
this
due
process
for
which
you're
arguing?
unknown
speaker
how
could
we
ever
tell
that
if
it
comports
with
the,
sort
of
the
ultimate
substantive
standard
of
bearing
at
least
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
facts
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
with
respect
to
punitive
damages,
why
isn't
any
verdict
acceptable
if
it
bears
the...
if
it
can
be
said
to
bear
a
reasonable
relationship
to
those
facts
in
evidence
which
would
indicate
that
punitive
damages
were
appropriate?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
your
argument...
then,
maybe
i'm
missing
something.
your
argument
at
this
point
seems
to
be
boiling
down
to
this:
whatever
state
law
provides,
we
ought
to
get.
unknown
speaker
and
state
law
doesn't
provide
anything,
apparently,
for
you
here.
unknown
speaker
your
point
would
be
applicable
in
a
compensatory
damages
review,
too?
unknown
speaker
you
contend
that
that
constitutional
provision
prevents
the
oregon
courts
from
even
applying
passion
and
prejudice
review,
don't
you--
unknown
speaker
--and
although
you
don't
assert
that
passion
or
prejudice
review
will
suffice
for
purposes
of
constitutional
sufficiency,
you
deny
that
there
was
even
passion
or
prejudice--
unknown
speaker
--review
here,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
deny,
i
take
it,
that
there
was
at
least
the
possibility
of
review
for
that...
we'll
say
that
ultimate
substantive
threshold--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
required
by
the
supremacy
clause.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
however,
that
oregon
has
not
denied
you,
at
least
in
terms,
any
substantive...
any
review
under
a
substantive
federal
standard
that
you
claim
is
applicable.
unknown
speaker
have
they
ever
come
out
and
said,
there
is
a
federal
standard
constitutionally
applicable
to
us,
but
our
constitution
forbids
us
to
entertain
an
appeal
on
that
ground?
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
us
what
is
this
constitutionally
minimal
procedure?
what
process
are
you
due?
i
feel
a
little
nebulous
about
that.
you
say,
some
process.
what
is
that
process?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
get
a
review
for
no
evidence,
and
you
get
a
review
if
the
judge
thinks
that
the
instructions
were
not
adequate.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
judge
looks
at
the
amount
of
the
prayer
in
the
complaint
before
the
issue
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
and
concludes
that
on
this
evidence,
that
maximum
amount
would
be
a
sustainable
award.
does
it
have
to
be
a
retrospective
assessment?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder,
would
it
be
constitutionally
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
but
this
verdict
was
a
general
verdict,
wasn't
it?
they
didn't
find
the
existence
of
malice
and
wealth
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
they
didn't
make
any
special
findings.
unknown
speaker
i'm
curious
to
know
how
far
your
theory
extends,
mr.
frey.
the
state
of
arizona
has
a
provision
in
its
constitution
that
the
issue
of
contributory
negligence
and
the
issue
of
assumption
of
risk
shall
always
be
questions
for
the
jury,
and
the
courts
can't
review
jury
findings
on
those.
now,
would
that
be
unconstitutional
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
why
should
the
constitutionally
mandated
review
be
any
more
than
is
required
in
a
criminal
case,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
think
that
standard
is,
the
jackson
standard?
if
any
reasonable
juror
could
have
reached
a
conclusion
it's
okay?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
justification
for
requiring
more
than
would
be
required
on
review
in
a
criminal
case
in
a
punitive
damages
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
have
thought
the
standard
was
the
one
i
mentioned
in
jackson.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
be
satisfied
with
that...
a
procedure
that
provided
for
that
review
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
would
you
be
satisfied
with
that,
because
i
understood
that
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--the
implication
of
what
you
were
just
saying.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
not
attacked
anything
but
what
you
deemed
to
be
the
procedural
deficiency
in
review
of
the
verdict
that
comes
in.
you
have
not
attacked
any
other
aspect
of
the
oregon
system,
e.g.,
the
adequacy
of
its
instructions,
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
we've
got
to
take
the
case
on
the
assumption,
i
presume,
that
the
remainder
of
the
oregon
system
is
constitutionally
adequate.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
saying
that
the
other
accoutrements
that
sometimes
operate
as
checks
on
juries
are
necessary.
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
a
remittitur,
just
as
long
as
you
have
a
judge
look
it
over.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
you're
striking
out
the
remittitur,
and
you
could
have...
if
the
judge
thinks
that
the...
there
should
be
another
jury
you
could
have
just
limited
to
damages,
that
would
be
all
right,
too.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
in
light
of
some
history
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
jury
even
decided
questions
of
law,
when
at
least
in
some
places
jury
verdicts--
unknown
speaker
--were
not
reviewable?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
best
cases
you
have,
mr.
frey,
for
the
proposition
that
some
judicial
review
beyond
passion
and
prejudice
review
was
traditional
in
the
american
system,
or
in
the
english
system
at
the
time
of
the
founding?
what
are
the
best
cases
you
have?
unknown
speaker
okay,
i'll
say...
or
anything
beyond.
i'm
saying
that--
unknown
speaker
--i
want
cases
that
go
beyond
passion
and
prejudice,
and
that's
what
you're
giving
me.
unknown
speaker
give
me
your
best
cases,
mr.
frey,
whatever
you
think
they
say.
what
are
your
very
best
ones?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
discuss
prior
cases,
either,
and
it's
dictum,
and
i
might
have
been
wrong.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
to
be
specific,
mr.
frey,
there
was
a
brief...
one
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
that
suggested
that
maybe
this
court
was
wrong
about
what
the
common
law
was.
there
was
a
mixed
picture.
there
were
some
decisions
that
sounded
like,
particularly
in
tort
cases,
the
jury
has
the
last
word.
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
at
least
some
decisions
made
noises
the
other
way.
i
mean,
some
of
the
cases...
you
cited
contract
cases,
where
you
do
have...
it's
almost
a
question
of
law
whether
these
damages
are
proper
damages
or
not,
but
tort
cases,
where
it's
pain
and
suffering,
where
the
damages
are
unliquidated--
unknown
speaker
--and
especially
where
the
damages
are
punitive,
and
therefore
very
hard
to
say--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
going
to
give
me
your
best
cases?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
going
to
give
me
your
best
cases.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
willing
to
select
among
them
just
a
couple
that
you
think
are
the
tops?
okay.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
prerogative.
you
also
don't
think
that
this
court
is
subject
to
issue
preclusion
because
in
a
prior
case...
one
of
the
things
you
seem
to
say
in
your
reply
brief
was
that
this
court
had
said
there
was
court
review
of
a
jury
verdict,
that
was
the
traditional
common
law
approach,
and
the
court
has
already
decided
that.
is
not...
the
court
is
fallible,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
issue
preclusion
on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
let
me
ask
just
one
question.
you
said
you
are
entitled
to
have
the
state
law
rule,
substantive
rule,
a
procedure
available
to
have
a
judge
determine
whether
the
state's
substantive
law
was
applied.
unknown
speaker
what
state
rule
of
substantive
law
are
you
arguing
was
not
applied?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
a
state
rule
of
law
that
the
damages
award
may
not
be
excessive
as
long
as
it
complies
with
the
instructions
and
the
various
criteria
that
they
describe?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
begging
the
question.
i
mean,
you're
saying,
as
you
put
it,
you
said,
even
if
the
oregon
supreme
court
finds
that
the
damages
are
excessive
under
state
law,
the
constitutional
provision
says
that
they
cannot
review
it
for
that
excessiveness.
another
way
to
view
the
constitutional
provision
is
as
saying,
in
effect,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
excessiveness
of
damages
for
purposes
of
oregon
substantive
law.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
such
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
said
it
was
excessive,
but
they
didn't
say
it
violated
the
law
of
oregon.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
they...
isn't
it
consistent...
isn't
it
a
reading
of
what
they
said
simply
that
if
we
were
writing
on
a
clean
slate
we'd
probably
have
a
thirteenth
juror
rule
that
says...
that
would
in
fact
overturn
this
verdict,
but
we
don't
have
a
clean
slate,
and
we
do
not
have
the
authority...
i.e.,
the
law
of
oregon
does
not
give
us
the
authority
or
provide
a
standard
for
review?
unknown
speaker
are
they
saying--
unknown
speaker
--that
it
was
an
error
for
the
trial
judge
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury
on
the
state
of
the
complaint
where
an
award
up
to
$5
million
could
be
returned
by
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
a
judge
must
submit
to
the
jury
any
punitive
damages
request
that
the
plaintiff
cooks
up
in
the
complaint?
i
thought
the
result
was...
the
rule
was
quite
the
opposite.
unknown
speaker
but
the
complaint
can
exceed--
unknown
speaker
--the
complaint
can
exceed
an
amount
of
what
the
evidence
would
justify?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
frey.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
tribe,
you
and
your
colleague
differ
very
much
about
what
oregon
allows
under
these
cases
in
the
way
of
review
of
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought
you
differed
on
this
point,
too--
unknown
speaker
--having
read
all
the
briefs,
and
what
if
after
duly
deliberating--
unknown
speaker
--we
simply
cannot
decide
which
of
you
is
right
as
to
the
nature
of
the
review
oregon
affords?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
about
that.
don't
we
have
to
take
our
best
shot
at
figuring
out
what
the
oregon...
you
certainly
wouldn't--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
you
wouldn't
propose
in
an
equal
protection
or
race
discrimination
case
that
if
we
couldn't
figure
out
what
the
law
of
the
state
was
we'd
just
say,
well,
we
can't
figure
it
out,
so--
unknown
speaker
--we
have
to
assume
you
haven't
been...
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
tribe,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
that,
because
the
standard
for
review
is
no
evidence,
and
according
to
what
you've
just
told
us,
you
would
never
have
a
no-evidence
situation,
because
you
can't
give
the
case
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place
unless
the
top
figure
is
one
that
is
sustainable--
unknown
speaker
--by
the
evidence,
but
no
evidence,
mr.
frey
suggested...
it
could
be
a
scintilla--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
wouldn't
do.
unknown
speaker
to
set
a
cap
in
what
way,
mr.
tribe?
unknown
speaker
to
instruct--
unknown
speaker
--the
plaintiff's
lawyer
not
to
argue
for
more
than
$2
million?
unknown
speaker
and
these
were
both
punitive...
van
lom
and
the
other
case
you're
referring
to
were
both
punitive
damages
cases?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
much
different
picture
when
you're
trying
to
figure
out
actual
damages
on
the
evidence--
unknown
speaker
--supporting
and
then
punitive--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
tribe,
let
me
just
ask
you
if
i
may--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
not
possible
that
a
plaintiff
will
have
alternate
theories
of
liability
both
for
punitive
damages
and
actual
damages,
and
that
on
one
theory
$5
million
would
be
appropriate,
on
another
theory,
$1
million
would
be
appropriate.
what
does
the
judge
do
there?
does
he--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
take
the
position
that
they
are
required
under
oregon
law
in
that
kind
of
case?
unknown
speaker
could
you
clarify
first
to
me
whether--
unknown
speaker
--you're
saying
that
there
can
never
be
an
excessive
verdict
in
oregon
because
the
district
judge
before...
the
trial
judge
before
ever
giving
the
case
to
the
jury
will
set
an
amount...
will
make
sure
that
the
amount
that's
sought
is
not
excessive?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
i
dare
say
that
judges
of
oregon
are
not
going
to
thank
you
for
establishing
the
proposition
that
they
can
be
asked
ex
ante,
before
the
trial,
to
pick
a
number.
it's
one
thing
after
the
trial
to
say,
this
is
too
much.
it's
quite
another
thing
before
the
trial
to
pick
a
number
and
say--
unknown
speaker
--anything
more
than
this
is
excessive
punitive
damages,
and
that's
really
what
you
think
the
oregon
system
is?
unknown
speaker
i'd
find
it
a
very
difficult
system
to
administer.
unknown
speaker
you're
asking
them
to
define
obscenity
instead
of
recognizing
it
when
they
see
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
assumes
there's
only
one
theory
of
liability.
you
can
have
specific,
special
interrogatories
and
all
the
rest
that
make
a
lot
of
variables
in
a
judge's
task.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
a
judge
can
do
it
before...
when
he's
doing
the
instructions
and
everything
else,
he
can
figure
out
the
answer
because
he
knows
what
the
jury
is
going
to
decide
on
the
merits--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
interrupt
with
one
other
question?
do
you
think
the
system
would
be
constitutionally
inadequate
if
it
did
not
require
the
judge
to
do
this?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
you've
just
read
they
say
is
a
quote
from
van
lom.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
what
he's
saying
today,
so
it
seems
to
me
that's
kind
of
a
waste
of
time
to
debate.
unknown
speaker
except
for
what
they
say.
unknown
speaker
they
say
it
won't
be
reviewed
for
excessiveness
or
weight
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
could
take
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
at
its
word
here
that
they
don't
provide
review
unless
there
is
no
evidence,
or
for
instructions
that
were
given.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
we
should
debate
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
what
about
the
broader
theory
of
the
petitioner's
case,
that
whatever
the
state
law
provides,
there
must
be
a
procedure
to
ensure
that
the
jury's
verdict
conforms
to
that
rule?
i
take
it
that's
a
fair
statement--
unknown
speaker
--of
mr.
frey's
position.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
underlying
theory.
does
he...
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--an
acceptable
constitutional--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
a
federal
guarantee
that
no
reasonable
juror
could
have
awarded
this
sum?
unknown
speaker
yes,
except
that
if
you
take
the
oregon
court
at
its
word
on
the
meaning
of
its
constitution,
they
can't
apply
even
that.
unknown
speaker
who's
counsel
for
oregon?
unknown
speaker
procedural
due
process,
i
was
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
could
you
comment
explicitly
on
something
which
i
think
you've
been
commenting
implicitly
on
all
along,
and
that
is
language
which
is
clearly
troublesome
to
some
members
of
the
court,
and
i
think
on
its
face
to
me,
in
that
quotation
from
page
3
of
the
blue
brief,
in
which
the
oregon
court
disclaims
the
authority
to
review
the
evidence
as
to
whether
in...
the
verdict
as
to
whether
in
any
other
respect
it
is
opposed
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence?
it's
that
phrase,
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
implicitly
in
what
you're
saying
is
that
that
phrase,
weight
of
the
evidence,
refers
to
a
kind
of,
you
might
say,
a
finicky
judgment,
thirteenth
juror
kind
of
review,
as
opposed
to
the
far
broader
substantive
due
process
question
that
you've
identified,
due
process
standard
that
you've
identified.
am
i
right
in
saying
what
i
just
said?
in
other
words,
weight
of
the
evidence
is
a
term
of
art,
and
it
refers
to
a
kind
of
thirteenth
juror
review?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
do
you...
what
is
your
support
for
the
proposition,
which
i
think
you
maintain,
that
oregon
does
apply
a
passion
or
prejudice
standard,
meaning
by
passion
or
prejudice,
passion
or
prejudice
that
is
evidenced
exclusively
by
the
excessiveness
of
the
verdict,
and
not
aliunde
by,
you
know,
some
conduct
in
the
jury
room
or--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
against
the
backdrop.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe--
unknown
speaker
--in
your...
you've
now
said
it
a
few
times,
attributed
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
the
words,
substantial
evidence,
as
distinguished
from
no
evidence.
in
one
of
those
cases
that
you
cited,
can
you
tell
us
which
one
uses
the
phrase,
substantial
evidence
supports
the
jury's
verdict?
unknown
speaker
there's
just
some
uncertainly
about
what
that
means.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
reason
to
believe
it
means
functionally
something
different
from
the
federal
substantive
standard?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
the
oregon
constitution
has
a
provision
that
no
other
state
constitution
has.
in
what
respect
is
oregon
different
from
any
other
state?
your
argument
seems
to
go
to
the
effect
that
there
is
review.
it's
the
same
as
in
the
other
states.
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
answer
suggests
a
degree
of
precision
among
these
various
doctrines
that
just
doesn't
exist.
you
know,
i
don't
think
these
various
courts
have
said,
well,
we
see
that
some
states
use
weight
of
the
evidence,
thirteenth
juror,
we're
not
going
to
use
it,
we're
going
to
use
substantial
evidence,
as
if
these
were
highly--
unknown
speaker
--refined
notions.
i
don't
think
they
are.
unknown
speaker
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
troubles
me.
assume
that
in
txo
we
had
held
that
the
punitive
damage
award,
that
there's
a
federal
limit,
substantive
limit
on
the
award,
and
it
can
be
no
more
than
ten
times
the
actual
damage
award...
just
assume
that...
and
oregon
gave
general
instructions
as
they
did
here,
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
where
the
punitive
damages
award
was
eleven
times
the
actual
damage
award.
would
there
be
any
review
in
oregon
of
such
a
holding?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
oregon
would
provide
review?
if
oregon
did
not
provide
review
in
my
hypothetical,
would
their
system
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
they
wouldn't
correct
the
specific
error
i
identified?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
we
have
to
decide,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
understand
them
to
be
saying
that
if
there's
evidence
that
will
support
some
punitive
damage
award,
that's
the...
and
also
if
all
the
right
instructions
have
been
given,
that's
all
we're
going
to
look
at.
unknown
speaker
you
think
i
misread
their
cases,
right?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
what
they
say.
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
there's
some
evidence
to
support
some
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it's
grossly
excessive
under
oregon
state
law,
but
we
still
won't
review
it?
would
that
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
now,
it's
not...
in
cloverleaf
it
was
a
question
of
which
body
would
decide
it.
the
question
is
whether
nobody
has
to
decide
it
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
unknown
speaker
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
frey,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
there
in
effect
review
when
the
judge
can
say,
well,
my
instructions
couldn't
have
been
understood.
i
instructed
them
absolutely
properly,
and
if
they
came
out
with
this
number,
then
they
weren't
following
my
instructions,
so
i'm
going
to
overturn
the
judgment
on
that
basis...
the
verdict
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
if
a
judge
thought
his
instructions
weren't
adequate...
oh,
you're
saying
if
the
judge
thinks
the
jury
didn't
understand
his
instructions,
he
couldn't
order
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
so
if
a
judge
in
oregon
thinks--
unknown
speaker
--the
judge
looked
at
this
jury
and
said,
this
jury
really
didn't
understand
what
i
was
saying,
there
would
be
no
power
to--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
the
judge
thinks
the
flaw
is
that
she
didn't
instruct
with
sufficient
clarity
so
that
the
jury
comprehended
what
she
was
trying
to
say?
