mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
to
decide
whether
a
defendant
in
a
civil
case
has
a
right
to
any
judicial
review
of
a
jury
verdict
alleged
to
be
excessive
under
applicable
state
or
federal
substantive
damages
law,
or
indeed,
a
plaintiff
claiming
that
a
verdict
is
insufficient.
in
the
texaco
pennzoil
case
a
punitive
verdict
of
$3
billion
was
returned
by
the
jury,
and
it
was
reduced
on
judicial
review
by
$2
billion.
in
grimshaw
v.
ford
motor
company,
a
$125
million
punitive
verdict
was
reduced
to
three
and
a
half
million
dollars.
in
proctor
v.
upjohn,
a
$125
million
verdict
was
reduced
by
the
court
to
$35
million.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
these
are
state
court
decisions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there's
a
lot
of
debate
about
what
the
standard...
you
mean
in
determining
whether
a--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--punitive
verdict
is
excessive?
the
standards
may
vary.
they
are
a
matter
of
the
state
substantive
law
of
damages,
the
state
substantive
law
of
punitive
damages,
which
will
set
up
a
structure
for
determining
the
amount
of
damages
not
in
any
liquidated
or
definite
sense,
but
in
some
general
sense.
it
will
identify
factors
that
are
relevant,
it
may
call
for
proportionality
review
with
other
verdicts,
it
may
limit--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i'm
not
certain
what
the
standards
were,
but
i
don't
think
it
matters
for
the
purposes
of
this
court's
decision.
the
only
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
if
those
verdicts
had
been
returned
in
oregon,
the
court
would
have
lacked
the
power
to
consider
whether
they
conform
to
the
law
of
oregon.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it's
very
important
in
understanding
this
question
to
distinguish
between
the
procedural
due
process
requirement...
that
is,
what
procedures
must
be
provided,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
this
morning,
and
the
substantive
law
of
damages,
which
is
to
say,
what
law
determines
how
much
is
an
acceptable
range
of
damages
on
a
given
set
of
facts?
we
are
not
saying
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
oregon,
or
that
the
other
states
in
those
cases,
have
to
have
any
particular
substantive
law
of
damages.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
doubt
that.
the
question...
if
you're
asking
for
passion
or
prejudice...
if
you
are
saying
to
me...
i
guess
i
want
to
give
a
two-part
answer
to
that
question,
if
i
may.
the
first
is,
passion
or
prejudice
means
different
things.
in
our
view,
the
term
is
ordinarily
used
as
a
rubric
for
actually
conducting
excessiveness
review,
but
it
could
be
the
reverse.
that
is,
you
could
look
at
the
size
of
the
verdict
and
say
it's
a
product
of
passion
and
prejudice,
or
you
could
say,
we
will
not
look
at
the
size
of
the
verdict
at
all,
but
if
we
see
other
evidence,
such
as
an
improper
jury
argument
or
some
other
extraneous
evidence
that
might
cause
passion
and
prejudice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
may
be
much
harder
to
pin
down,
and
that
suggests
that
there
is
a
difference
between
liquidated
kinds
of
damages
inquiry
and
the
kind
of
unliquidated
inquiry
where
you're
asking
how
much
pain
and
suffering
the
plaintiff
experienced
as
a
result
of
his
or
her
injury,
or
how
much
is
an
appropriate
amount
of
punishment.
but
state
law
says,
for
example,
deterrence
is
relevant.
state
law
may
say
comparative
review
is
important.
that
is,
the
verdict
should
not
be
disproportionate
to
other
verdicts
that
have
been
returned
in
the
state.
now,
i'm
not
saying
the
federal
constitution
requires
the
state
to
have
such
a
rule,
but
i
am
saying,
if
the
state
does
have
such
a
rule,
we
have
a
right
to
have
that
rule
applied
to
the
verdict
in
the
case
by
a
judge
to
determine
whether
the
verdict
comports
with
the
state's
substantive
law
of
damages.
the
state's
substantive
law
of
damages
may
be
that
damages
are
disfavored
and
should
be
small
in
product
liability
cases,
because
they
affect
the...
punitive
damages,
let's
say,
because
they
affect
the
cost
of
goods
to
consumers.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
okay,
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
take
those
in
order,
and
forgive
me
if
i
forget
some
of
them,
but
to
start
out,
i
do
want
to
complete
the
answer
to
justice
stevens.
i
think
passion
and
prejudice
is
not
enough,
because
even
a
well
meaning
jury
not
inflamed
by
passion
and
prejudice
can
make
a
mistake.
they
can
misunderstand
the
legal
constraints.
they
can
come
up
in
good
faith
with
an
aberrant
verdict
which
violates
the
state
law,
substantive
law
of
damages.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
would
never
have
to
tell
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
would
never
have
to
tell
that.
that
is,
the
supreme
court
would
not
be
asked
that
question.
the
state
supreme
court...
there
is
a
state
law
of
damages.
if
you
had...
imagine
a
bench
trial
in
which
the
judge
has
to
determine
the
amount
of
damages.
state
law,
which
may
not
be
very
articulated
or
detailed
in
the
form
of
a
code,
but
it
exists.
there
are
principles
that
guide
his
or
her
selection
of
damages.
for
instance,
to
take
compensatory
damages
for
pain
and
suffering,
the
amount
is
supposed
to
be
the
amount
that
would
appropriately
compensate
the
plaintiff
for
injury.
now,
i
understand
that
there
is
a
range
within
which
reasonable
people
could
disagree,
and
it
may
be
a
very
substantial
range,
and
any
verdict
that
is
within
that
range
by
a
jury,
or
any
judgment
returned
by
a
judge
within
that
range,
is
acceptable,
but...
and
therefore
not
subject
to
being
set
aside.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
state
law
may
impose
greater
constraints
than
that
on
punitive
damages.
state
law
may
have
a
whole
set
of
rules,
and
often
does.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
whatever
state
law
provides--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
no,
no.
what
state
law
doesn't
provide...
there
is
an
oregon
law
of
damages.
i'm
not
sure
what
it
is.
i'm
not
here
today
to
argue
whether
it
was
rightly
or
wrongly
applied,
because
article
vii,
section
3
of
the
oregon
constitution
deprives
the
oregon
courts
of
the
right
to
apply
that
law
of
damages
to
the
verdict
in
any
particular
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we...
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
no
possibility--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
i
don't...
this
gets
into...
this
is
not
the
main
point
in
our
argument.
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
have
the
verdict
reviewed
for
its
compliance
with
both
state
and
federal
substantive
law
of
damages,
whatever
that
law
is,
and
in
the
case
of
the
due
process
clause--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--we
believe
the
oregon
courts
are
without
jurisdiction
under
state
law
to
conduct
such
review,
and
we
believe
we
were
deprived
of
that
review.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
haven't
come
out
and
said
it,
but
they
have
come
out
and
said
that
verdicts
that
are
excessive,
they
lack
the
jurisdiction,
the
power,
to
set
aside.
they
lack
the
power
to
review
and
consider
a
claim
that
a
verdict
was
excessive.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
process
that
we
say...
well,
let's
start
off
with
what
we
get,
which
is,
when
a
verdict
is
returned,
we
get
no
judge
to
examine
whether
the
verdict
conforms
with
the
substantive
law
that
regulates
the
size
of
verdicts.
we
do
not
get
that
review,
in
our
opinion.
there's
a
debate
about
whether
we
do
or
we
don't,
but
we
think
it's
clear
that
we
don't.
our
position--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--all
right,
i
have
two...
we
get
a
review
for
no
evidence,
which
means
a
review
for
liability.
that
is,
whether
punitive
liability
is
established,
and
i
might
say
that
i
think
the
no
evidence
standard
is
not
constitutionally
acceptable
itself,
and
jackson
v.
virginia
provides
some
support
for
that.
it
rejects
the
no-evidence
standard
in
favor
of
taking
the
facts
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict,
could
any
reasonable
jury
define
the
standard,
but
that's
not
the
main
point.
we
say
that
giving
instructions
to
the
jury
does
not
cure
the
unfairness
of
being
unable
to
correct
an
aberrational
jury
verdict
that
violates
the
state
law
of
damages,
or
the
federal
law
of
damages,
and
we
say
that
part
of
the
right
to
which
we
are
entitled,
which
is
a
right
that
has
existed
for
centuries
in
the
common
law
system,
which
is
a
right
that
exists
every
place
else
in
the
united
states,
is
to
have
a
judge
look
at
that
verdict
and
ask
himself
or
herself,
does
it
comport
with
the
law.
that
is
the
procedure.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
guess
i
have
two
things
to
say
about
that.
the
first
is
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
questions
you
can
ask
about
the
state
procedural
system
in
determining
whether
it's
sufficiently
fair.
the
first
question
is
whether
some
ingredient
is
an
indispensable
element
such
as
an
unbiased
decisionmaker,
or
we
say
some
form
of
judicial
review
wherever
the
jury
is
given
substantial
discretion.
you
can
also
ask
a
question
whether
the
overall
system,
which
is
what
the
oregon
court
asks,
whether
the
overall
system
is
fair
enough,
taking
into
account
various
other
protections.
now,
we
don't
think
oregon
has...
certainly
we
had
no
notice
that
this
is
the
procedure
by
which
you
could
do
it.
i
think
it
would
be
better
than
nothing
to
have
that
happen.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
rest
of
the
system,
but
i
suppose
if
the
judge
actually
sat
down...
well,
it
depends
on
the
case,
i
think
is
the
answer,
because
the
judge
can't
know
in
advance
what
the
jury's
findings
are
going
to
be.
you
may
have
a
variety
of
theories.
the
jury
may
come
back
with
verdicts
that
tell
you
that
they
only
found
some
of
the
things
and
not
others,
so
the
inquiry
for
the
judge
would
be
an
extraordinarily--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--right.
in
fact,
we
asked
for
a
special
verdict
and
were
denied
one.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
raises
an
interesting
question,
because
we're
dealing
with
an
affirmative
defense,
and
that
may
be
different
from
the
elements
of
the
case,
but
i
think
i
have...
if
the
state
substantive
law
is
that
you
are
not
liable
to
pay
damages
to
a
plaintiff
who
was
contributorily
negligent,
i
have
difficulty
with
the
proposition
that
a
fair
system
provides
no
judicial
review.
so
i
would
have
my
doubts,
although
i
think
our
case
is
a
substantially
stronger
case
than
that,
but
i
would
doubt
whether
that
would
be
constitutionally
sufficient.
i
understand
there's
a
case
from
1919
that
held
that,
but
we
have
made
the
point
that
it
hasn't
been
cited
for
over
60
years,
and
that
it's
inconsistent,
we
think,
with
the
court's
modern
procedural
due
process
doctrine.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
know
that
we're
asking
for
any
more
than
is
required
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we've
spent
a
lot
of
time
talking
about...
i
think
that
might
be
an
acceptable
standard.
the
question
that's
before
the
court
is
whether
a
judge
applying
some
standard
has
to
determine
whether
the
verdict
conformed
with
the
law.
now,
i
think
that
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
i
don't
think
we're
suggesting
that
more
would
be
required,
but
it
may
depend
on
what
the
state
law
is.
i
don't
think
we
are
suggesting
that
any
more
is
required,
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
doubt
that
in
a
criminal
case
you
could
irrevocably
commit
to
the
jury's
discretion
the
question
whether
the
evidence
is
sufficient,
no
matter
how
well
instructed
the
jury
is.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
accept...
i
mean,
i
think
the
standard
on
how
you
assess
the
facts
is
you
take
the
facts
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict,
and
you
ask
whether
any
reasonable
juror,
or
any
reasonable
jury,
in
light
of
those
facts,
could...
applying
the
law
to
those
facts,
could
come
to
the
conclusion
they
came
to.
i
have
no
problem
with
that
standard.
that's
what
we
would
like
to
see
the
court
supply.
now--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
we
didn't
get
that
review.
we
say
that
that's
what
we
need.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
the
least
we
feel
we
are
entitled
to.
now,
if
you
ask
me
would
i
be
satisfied
with
that,
in
the
haslip
case,
what
the
court
did
was,
it
looked
at
the
system
that
alabama
had,
and
it
said
this
overall
system
is
a
procedurally
fair
system
in
part
because
the
alabama
courts
give
a
kind
of
review
which
clearly
is
more
than
the
constitution
would
require
if
you
looked
at
that
element
standing
alone.
but
the
alabama
system
was
marginal
at
best
in
the
quality
of
the
jury
instructions
that
were
given,
and
the
court
looked
at
the
overall
system,
so
i'm
reluctant
to
say
that
the
overall
oregon
system
is
a
fair
enough
system
for
administering
punitive
damages.
but
what
we
are
asking
for
today
is
that
we
have,
at
a
minimum,
a
judge
apply
something
like
the
jackson
standard.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
so--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--we...
i
believe
you
could
fully
discharge
your
duty
by
saying
that
it's
inadequate
in
this
respect
and
remanding
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
remittitur
is
a
device
to
which
defendants
object,
because
it
is
a
substitute
for
a
new
trial,
which
defendants
want.
i
don't
think
a
remittitur
is
constitutionally
required,
but
it
is
actually
a
pro-plaintiff
device,
because
historically
it
evolved
as
a
substitute
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
nothing
that
we
say
here
today
raises
that
problem.
i
don't
want
to
be
taken
to
be
conceding
when
we
get
back
to
the
oregon
court
that
the
rest
of
the
system
is
sufficient,
but
for
purposes
of
this
court's
review,
the
only
question
we
present
is
whether
oregon
is
obligated
to
have
a
judge
examine
this
verdict
in
light
of
the
federal
and
state
substantive
law
of
damages
and
ask
whether
the
verdict
is
excessive
or
not
under
that
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
say
that
that
was
an
incident
of
the
right
of
jury
nullification.
it
was
not
true
in
civil
cases
at
common
law
or
in
civil
cases
generally,
i
don't
believe.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
many
of
the
cases
don't
refer
to
passion
and
prejudice.
they
refer
to
whether
the
verdict
is
outrageously
excessive,
or
grossly
excessive,
or
i
think
the
formulation--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
mean...
there
are...
well,
the
courts
don't,
i
think,
analyze
the
matter
that
way.
they
characterize
the
verdict
in
explaining
why
they
set
it
aside.
sometimes
they
say
the
verdict
is
the
product
of
passion
and
prejudice,
or
it's
so
large
that
it
must
be
the
product
of
passion
and
prejudice.
sometimes
they
say
it's
excessive.
now,
it
may
be
excessive
with
respect
to
some
liquidated
or
clear
provision
of
law,
like
not
more
than
three
times
the
compensatories,
or
something
like
that,
or
it
may
be
excessive
in
the
abuse
of
discretion
sense,
that
whoever
was
the
fact-finder,
whoever
returned
the
verdict,
had
a
broad
range
of
discretion,
but
this
is
so
far
outside
the
range
of
discretion.
now,
when
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
there's
your
opinion
in
txo.
now,
it
doesn't
discuss
passion
and
prejudice,
but
what
it
says--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--you
might
have
been,
but
i
think
you
were
pretty
clearly
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
that
is...
it
is
clear
that
as
the
institution
of
the
jury
evolved
in
the
17th
and
18th
centuries,
one
of
the
essential
incidents
of
that
institution
was
to
have
judicial
review,
the
power
of
the
judge
to
send
the
case
to
a
new
jury
when
the
case
was...
when
the
decision
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--may
i
can
approach--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
i
don't
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
i
can't...
i
can't...
our
brief...
i
think
our
brief
covers
it.
i'm
not
prepared--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
think
i'm...
i
don't
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
the
court
could
revisit
questions--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
not...
well,
stare
decisis
i
suppose
would
be
the
question.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
court
is
bound,
but
i'm
saying
that
if
you
revisit
it,
and
even
if
you
didn't
revisit
it,
cases
like
jackson
i
think
make
clear
that
there
is
an
obligation.
in
the
fowler
case
in
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
1954,
they
said,
if
this
court
were
authorized
to
exercise
its
common
law
powers
we
would
unhesitatingly
hold
that
the
award
of
$35,000
as
punitive
damages
was
excessive,
but
they
say
under
article
vii,
section
3
we
are
without
power
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
punitive
damages
were
excessive.
now,
i
am
saying
that
a
provision
that
deprives
them
of
the
power
to
reverse
a
verdict
that
they
would
unhesitatingly
say
is
excessive
under
state
law
is
not
consistent
with
fundamental
fairness.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
are
arguing
that
the
state...
we
argued
below
that
the
verdict,
both
the
compensatory
and
the
punitive
were
excessive,
but
we
argued
for--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
the
correct
way
to
think
of
it
is
that
is
a
state
rule.
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
rule
of
substantive
law
or
not,
that
the
damages
may
not
be
excessive.
i
think
it
is
a
rule.
it
is
a
rule
that
the
courts
of
oregon
are
without
power
to
apply
in
jury
trials,
but
if
you
had
a
bench
trial--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--you
could...
you
could--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--you
could,
but
they
have
never
said
that.
they
have
clearly
said
that
there
are
verdicts
that
are
ex...
in
the
van
lom
case,
they
said
they
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
verdict
was
excessive,
but
they
lacked
the
power
to
set
it
aside.
in
a
bench
trial,
it's
clear
that
there
would
be
law
that
would
govern
this,
and
they
could
review
it
in
a
bench
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
but
that's
not
what
they
said.
first
of
all,
we're
not
talking
about
thirteenth
juror
review,
and
in
my
opinion,
when
they
say
that
the
judgment
is
manifestly
excessive
and
they
would
set
it
aside,
they
are
saying
that
it
is
unlawful,
under
oregon
law.
i
believe
that
is
what
they
are
saying.
i
think
it's
clear
that
that's
what
they're
saying.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
where
did
the
power--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
guess
if
you
asked
the
question
at
that
time,
and
if
you
were
going
to
spend
the
time
in
every
case
for
the
one
case
in
50
or
100
where
a
question
actually
arises.
this
is
not
the
procedure
of
oregon.
i
think
we
can
confidently
say
that
the
judge
would
not
have
undertaken
any
inquiry--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
rule
is
that
it
can't
exceed
the
amount
in
the
complaint.
it
can't
exceed
the
amount
sought
in--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--$50
million
or
$500
million.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
complaint
is
the
complaint.
then
you
have
the
evidence.
if
the
judge
undertook...
i
agree
that
it
is
theoretically
possible,
although
i
don't
believe
that
oregon
has
such
a
procedure,
to
ask
the
judge
in
every
case
ahead
of
time
to
determine
the
limit
of
the
damages
that
would
be
allowable,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
use
that
procedure,
and
i
don't
think
oregon
has
that
procedure.
if
it
wanted
to
adopt
such
a
cumbersome
and
burdensome
and
time-consuming
and
resource-consuming
procedure,
maybe
that
procedure
would
be
good
enough
to
satisfy
the
constitution,
but
i
don't
think
it
has
that
procedure,
and
i
don't
think
we
can
be
held
to
have
defaulted
in
this
case
for
not
employing
this...
or
certainly
the
oregon
supreme
court
didn't
suggest
that
that
was
why
we
were
not
getting
review.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
i'll
try
to
be
fast.
let
me
just
say
that
i
think
that
professor
tribe's
last
answer
shows
there
is
a
confusion
between
substantive
and
procedural
that's
going
on
here.
let
me
give
justice
scalia
a
case,
blunt
v.
little,
which
is
quoted
at
page
15
of
our
brief.
let
me
come
back
to
this
question
which
professor
tribe
puts
so
much
weight
on
about
the
preverdict
procedure.
there
is
no
such
procedure
in
oregon
for
unliquidated
damages,
and
somebody
asked
whether
it
would
be
fair
for
this
court
to
saddle
the
oregon
courts
with
such
a
procedure.
if
the
oregon
courts
chose
to
have
such
a
procedure
and
gave
people
notice
that
it
was
available,
that
might
satisfy
the
constitution,
but
you
could
not
affirm
this
decision
on
the
ground
that
such
a
procedure
exists
in
oregon.
it's
up
to
the
oregon
courts
to
decide
how
they
are
going
to
comply
with
the
requirement
that
there
be
some
judicial
review.
so
you
would
have
to
say
there
has
to
be
some,
we
send
it
back,
and
then
the
oregon
courts
would
craft
something
which
may
or
may
not
be
procedurally
adequate
to
assure
fundamental
fairness.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
cannot
be
done
in
oregon.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
too...
it's...
no.
the
instructions
would
have
to
be
themselves
legally
erroneous
in
order
to
order
a
new
trial,
in
which
case
the
oregon
supreme
court
would
have
the
power
to
enter
whatever
judgment
it
wants.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
doesn't
have
to
even
have
a
jury.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
exactly
the
problem.
if
they
concluded
that
the
verdict
is
in
excess
of
the
amount
that
would
be
regarded
by
all
reasonable
people
as
the
maximum
recovery
justified
by
the
evidence,
the
oregon
supreme
court
says,
too
bad,
there's
nothing
that
can
be
done
about
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
couldn't
look
at
what
the
jury
did.
you
could
look
at
the
instructions
and
ask
whether
they
comply
with
state
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
your
honor.
