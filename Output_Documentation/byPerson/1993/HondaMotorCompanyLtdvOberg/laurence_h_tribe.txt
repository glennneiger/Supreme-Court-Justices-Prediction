mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
might
begin
with,
i
think
a
crucial
question
that
justice
kennedy
has
been
pressing,
because
i
was
rather
surprised
by
the
answer.
it
seems
to
us
that
really
no
argument
whatever
has
been
offered
by
honda,
either
historical
or
functional,
for
the
peculiar
thing
they
say
they
have
a
right
to
as
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process,
namely,
review
by
a
judge
after
the
verdict...
and
i
underline
the
phrase,
after
the
verdict...
to
assure
compliance
with
state
law.
now,
apart
from
the
proposition
which
i
think
has
been
explored
by
justice
souter
and
justice
scalia
of
how
circular
their
claim
is...
i
mean,
state
law
doesn't
give
them
what
they
say
they
have
a
right
to...
and
apart
from
the
decisions
of
this
court,
summarized
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
holding
that
there
is
no
federal
right
to
make
sure
you
get
everything
the
state
promises,
outside
the
very
limited
context
of
cleveland
v.
loudermill
and
entitlement
theory,
apart
from
that,
the
fact
is
that
oregon
has
precisely
the
procedure
about
which
justice
kennedy
asked,
and
it's
not
that
different
from
federal
practice,
although
it's
in
a
damages
context.
the
leading
case,
indeed,
their
brief
reads
as
though
this
court
granted
cert
to
review
it
44
years
out
of
time,
is
van
lom,
in
oregon,
in
1949,
and
van
lom
very
carefully,
at
page
467
of
210
pacific
2nd,
reviews
a
series
of
cases...
lyons,
mcdaniels,
weatherspoon,
british
empire...
all
explicitly
holding
that
it
is
legal
error,
reversible
notwithstanding
article
vii,
section
3,
which
just
prevents
reexamination
of
a
jury
verdict
based
on
evidence,
legal
error
for
a
judge
not
to
cap
the
damages
at
the
highest
level
the
judge
believes
would
be
sustainable
under
the
evidence.
that,
in
a
sense,
disposes
of
this
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
not
on
this
issue,
mr.
chief
justice.
i...
their
brief
says
nothing
about
this.
we
discussed
it
in
our
brief.
there's
no
response.
this
is
an
undisputed
point
about
oregon
law.
we
do
differ
on
other
aspects,
you're
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
that
were
the
case,
then
one
would
affirm
this
judgment,
because
there
is
no
showing
that
oregon
violates
anything
that
is
comprehensible
as
procedural
due
process,
since
oregon...
i
mean,
i
suppose
you
could
say...
it
depends
on
what
you
were
unsure
of.
if
you
were
unsure
whether
oregon
provided
even
judicial
review
to
see
that
the
instructions
complied
with
federal
requirements,
if
you
believed
that
oregon,
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question,
had
somehow
defied
federal
law
and
said
no,
we
will
not
apply
haslip,
even
though
we
did
in
this
case,
if
there
were
some
ambiguity...
that
is,
if
looking
at
this
case
you
couldn't
tell
whether
oregon
is
one
of
those
states
that
is
simply
defying
the
supremacy
clause,
i
suppose
you
could
vacate
and
remand,
but
there
is...
if
there's
uncertainty,
it's
only
about
marginal
matters,
marginal
matters
that
i
think
are
indispensable
to
establishing
a
procedural
due
process
theory,
but
not
to
establishing
whether
this
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
sure.
i
would
urge
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
no.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
of
course,
justice
scalia,
but
if
it
was
a
or
b,
and
the
only
thing
that
might
violate
the
constitution
was
c,
you
wouldn't
waste
this
court's
time
figuring
out
if
it's
a
or
b,
and
that's
what
i
think
we
have
here.
i
mean,
as
i
listen
to
what
kind
of
judicial
review--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
fowler
v.
courtemanche
in
oregon,
in
1954,
which
is
in
our
footnote
35,
definitively
rejects
the
scintilla
rule,
says
no
evidence
means
no
substantial
evidence,
and
the
one
ambiguity
that
i've
found
in
oregon
law
in
this
respect
is
the
question
whether
a
trial
judge
has
a
sua
sponte
duty
to
look
at
the
evidence,
even
without
a
request.
that
is,
suppose
it's
clear
to
the
judge
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that,
under
state
law,
the
highest
award
that
could
have
been
sustainable
here
under
the
no-evidence
rule,
meaning
no
substantial
evidence,
or
whatever
standard
mr.
frey
wants
this
court
to
adopt
is,
let's
say,
$2
million,
then
he
has
to
have
some
theory
of
what's
the
highest
that
would
make
sense
under
oregon's
substantive
law.
let's
suppose
it's
$2
million.
the
judge
who
is
able
to
determine
that
after
the
jury
has
spoken
is
no
less
able
to
determine
that
before
submitting
it
to
the
jury,
and
at
least
some
of
the
cases,
like
lyons,
suggest
that
in
that
circumstance
the
judge
has
a
duty,
sua
sponte,
to
set
a
cap.
in
more
recent
cases,
where
defense
counsel
have
not
taken
advantage--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
there--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
there
are
two
methods
used
in
oregon,
mr.
chief
justice.
one...
and
it
was
used
in
the
case
of
lane
v.
kelley
in
1982...
is
to
strike
that
part
of
the
complaint
that
asks
for
more,
and
under
the
oregon
rule
that
says
you
can't
recover
any
more
than
your
complaint,
that
has
the
necessary
result.
the
other,
which
was
endorsed
in
van
lom,
was
specifically
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they
are
to
return
a
verdict
of
no
more
than,
and
then
the
number
is
set.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
no
more
than
whatever
number
below
$5
million
they
thought
was
sustainable.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
in
those
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
after
saying
that
its
principles
applied
equally
to
punitive
and
compensatory
cases,
the
court
discussed
these.
they
were
not
punitive
damage
cases.
indeed,
they
were
ones,
i
would
be
quick
to
admit,
where
it
was
quite
easy
to
admit,
to
calculate--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
it's
very
different,
but
it's
no
more
different
before
the
jury
speaks
than
after,
that's
the
point.
admittedly,
it's
hard
to
tell,
as
you
asked,
you
know,
how
much
is
too
much?
like,
you
know,
in
amadeus,
when
the
emperor--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--reviews
the
song
and
says,
too
many
notes?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there
have
been
some
oregon
cases,
some
written
by
justice
linde,
like
andor
v.
united
airlines
in
1987,
which
have
suggested
that
alternative
instructions
could
be
given
in
cases
of
some
complexity--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
certainly
think
that
if
the
request
were
made
van
lom
would
be
strong
precedent
for
there
being
required,
but
no
request
was
made.
for
example,
in
the
closing
argument
to
the
jury,
honda's
counsel
said,
it's
hard
to
know
these
things,
but
i
think
anything
more
than
$50,000
here
would
be
unjust
enrichment.
we
cite
that
in
note
6
of
our
brief.
but
then
he
did
not
ask
to
have
a
cap
on
either
the
compensatory
or
the
punitive
damages
of
$50,000.
let
me
turn
to
the
broad
question
of
what
it
is
that
this
court
is
being
asked
to
constitutionalize
as
a
matter--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
not
saying
that
judges
do
that
in
every
case.
van
lom
endorsed
the
proposition
that,
if
asked,
they
have
a
duty
to
do
it.
there
is
contest
over
whether
they
ought
to
do
it
sua
sponte,
and
because,
as
the
chief
justice
points
out,
there
are
many
cases
in
which
it
would
be
very
hard
to
say
in
advance
that
a
verdict
of
more
than
x,
where
x
is
less
than
the
ad
damnum
requested
would
be
excessive,
they
don't
do
it.
but
it's
not
easier
to
say
after
the
jury
has
spoken,
that's
the
point.
you
see,
whatever--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
justice
scalia,
it's
not
before
the
trial--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
(a)
it's
not
before
the
trial,
it's
after
the
record
is
closed.
(b)
in
many
cases,
it
will
be
excruciatingly
difficult,
and
so
they
will
resist
it,
and
they
will
look
for
aspects
of
the
law
that
say,
we
don't
really
have
to
do
this,
but
(c),
if
it's
excruciatingly
difficult,
and
perhaps
difficult
to
the
point
of
being
meaningless,
what
is
it
that
we're
being
told
procedural
due
process
requires
them
to
do
after
the
fact?
that
is,
after
the
fact,
when
you've
seen
what
the
jury
has
done...
that
is,
in
oregon,
you
know
the
range.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
asking
them
to
number
the
page,
and
they
can
number
it
as
well
before
they
have
perused
it
as
after.
that
is,
we're
talking
here
about
a
fairly--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
but
justice
stevens,
i
really
want
to
focus
on
the
main
point,
which
is
the
before
and
after
point.
if
there
are
several--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
he
knows
in
oregon
that
they
can't
give
more
than
$5
million,
and
he
can
at
least
say
this:
on
no
theory
that
is
in
this
case,
under
oregon
law,
would
anything
more
than
$4
million
be
justifiable.
now,
i
readily
concede
it
will
be
a
rare
judge
who
would
be
able
to
say
that
before
the
fact.
it
is
equally
a
rare
judge
who
would
be
able
to
say,
hmm,
now
that
i've
seen
five,
i
think
four
would
have
been
better.
what
standard
would
be
judge
apply?
throughout
the
briefs
below,
and
i
do
think
this
is
terribly
important,
it
has
been
a
standard
which
really
says,
we
can't
just
look
deferentially,
jackson
v.
virginia-like,
at
what
the
jury
did.
in
their
opening
brief,
at
page
3,
they--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--to
do
this
advance
thing?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
certainly
not,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
just
makes
the
case
a
lot
easier,
but
even
if
that
procedure
were
not
available
in
oregon,
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
demonstrated
infirmity.
let
me,
if
i
might,
just
return
to
the
question
of
what
it
is
they're
asking.
if
you
look
at
their
opening
brief
at
page
3,
they
talk
about
reexamining
the
evidence
and
setting
aside
the
verdict
because--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--oh,
i'm
reading
from
page
3
of
the
blue
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
10
lines
down
where
they're
quoting
from
van
lom.
they
are
complaining
that
oregon
has
eliminated
the
power
of
a
trial
court
to
reexamine
the
evidence
and
set
aside
a
verdict
because
it
was
excessive,
or
in
any
other
respect
opposed
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
and
in
van
lom,
at
page
466,
the
court
states
what
it
is
understanding
the
state
constitution
to
mean.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct,
and
that
is...
that
is
the
deprivation
of
judicial
review
of
which
they
complain.
that
is,
when
they
say
what
it
is
about
the
oregon
constitution
that
ties
the
hands
of
judges
unduly,
they
quote
language
about
how,
under
the
oregon
constitution,
you
can't
reexamine
the
evidence
and
set
aside
the
verdict
because
it's
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
that's
what
they
apparently
wanted
to
correct
below,
throughout
the
proceedings
below.
for
example,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe,
asked
about
their
cases,
the
cases
that
they
thought
illustrated
the
kind
of
judicial
review
that
ought
to
be
available.
grimshaw
was
one
of
them,
from
california,
that
mr
frey
mentioned.
and
grimshaw,
174
cal.
rptr.
at
page
391,
explains
what
standard
they
use:
"independent
judgment
on
the
evidence".
that
is,
they
are
asking,
or
at
least
have
asked
throughout
the
proceedings
below...
asked
the
courts
of
oregon
not
simply
to
review
for
the
presence
of
substantial
evidence
that
makes
it
a
lawful
verdict,
which
is
the
most
they
could
get
in
a
criminal
context,
they've
been
asking
for
an
independent
reassessment.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
may
be.
i
can't
tell
what
he's
saying
today.
i
don't
want
to
waste
my
time,
but
i
don't
know
what
he's
asking
for
now.
if
he's
asking
for
jackson
v.
virginia
type
review,
then
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
see
why
that
isn't
what
already
is
given
in
oregon.
that's
not--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--what
would
meet
his
theory.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
excessive
or
in
any
other
respect
opposed
to
weight.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
o'connor--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
i
don't
intend
to.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
in
this
very
case,
however,
did
say
that
if
there
was
insufficient
evidence
on
each
of
the
statutory
elements
of
this
product
liability
scheme,
the
decision
should
be
set
aside.
it
did
not
say
that
the
decision
should
be
set
aside
only
if
the
federal
substantive
due
process
standard
was
not
met.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
it
is.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
whatever
state
law
provides
we
ought
to
get,
and
the
problem
i
have
with
that,
frankly,
is,
you
got
what
state
law
provided,
to
some
extent
by
definition.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
don't
think
it's
sustainable.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
what
he's
trying
to
do
is
extrapolate
from
things
like
the
impairment
of
contract
clause,
where
there
are
federal
constitutional
principles
that
can,
in
certain
limited
circumstances,
bind
the
state
to
its
word.
he's
trying
to
extrapolate
from
cases
where
the
state
defines
the
boundary
of
liberty
and
property
in
cases
like
arnett
v.
kennedy,
or
bishop
v.
wood,
or
cleveland
v.
loudermill,
and
then,
this
court
says,
you
define
the
property,
now
we
tell
you
what
is
due
process.
but
if
there
were
a
general
principle
that
says
that
there
is
a
kind
of
federal
constitutional
entitlement
enforceable
by
someone
called
a
judge
to
make
sure
that
the
state
not
only
says,
we
followed
our
own
procedures,
but
also
says,
we
guarantee
you
that
we
haven't
made
any
mistakes,
and
you're
entitled
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
to
that
kind
of
state
guarantee,
it's
utterly
incoherent,
i
think,
and
unprecedented.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that,
although
it's
sometimes
put
in
terms
of
gross
excessiveness,
is
the
federal
substantive
due
process
principle.
that
is,
the
proposition--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
this
case,
in
this
very
case,
elaborately
at
page
20a
of
the
petition
and
at
28a
and
29a
in
footnotes
10
and
14,
went
through
the
process
of
talking
about
how
reasonable
and
proportional
this
judgment
was.
indeed,
within
the
first
2
minutes
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
oregon
supreme
court,
on
january
10,
1992...
i
think
this
court
has
the
tape.
i
just
listened
to
it...
counsel
for
oregon
told
the
justices
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
that
he
"invited"--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i'm
sorry,
oberg.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
counsel
for
oberg
said
he
invited
the
oregon
court
to
engage
in
full
scrutiny
for
reasonableness,
proportionality
under,
as
he
put
it,
any
applicable
federal
test...
he
said,
go
for
it.
he
cited
haslip
and
said,
do
it.
the
justices
proceeded
to
do
it.
they
did
just
that.
i
think
it
is
really
an
insult
to
the
state
of
oregon
to
say
that,
although
they
haven't
ever,
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question,
said,
you
know,
we
will
interpret
article
vii,
section
3
of
our
constitution
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
us
from
enforcing
federal
substantive
due
process.
it's
an
insult
to
attribute
that
to
them.
they
never
said
it.
they
didn't
say
it
in
van
lom,
and
they
didn't
say
it
here.
in
van
lom,
they
were
talking
about
a
special
problem
of...
and
a
provision
very
similar
to
article
vii,
and
in
describing
it
they
said,
we
simply
may
not...
and
this
is
page
466.
we
don't
think
a
court
may
"substitute
its
judgment
as
to
the
facts
for
a
verdict
based
on
competent
evidence
returned
by
a
properly
instructed
jury.
"
they
don't
want
to
substitute
their
judgment.
now,
that
does
not
mean
that
they
are
saying,
we
will
not
ask
whether
this
verdict
is
grossly
excessive,
whether
it's
the
product
of
passion
or
prejudice,
and
when
justice
scalia
asks
what's
their
best
case
on
whether
they
are
entitled,
as
a
matter
of
substantive
due
process,
to
anything
more
than
passion
or
prejudice,
i
think
they've
had
their
shot.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
procedural...
yes,
exactly,
procedural
due
process.
the
beardmore
case
in
1764,
which
is
cited
in
the
historians'
brief,
sort
of
deals
with
what
it
regards
as
their
best
case.
it's
a
case
called
chambers
v.
robinson
in
1726.
it
says
it's
the
only
one
which
went
beyond
passion
or
prejudice
in
the
18th
century,
and
that
it's
lawless
and
we
disapprove
it.
it's
certainly
no
solid
historical
tradition
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process
you're
entitled
to
anything
more
than
a
look
to
see
if
this
jury
was
in
a
sense
lawless
and
biased.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
justice
souter.
that
is,
that
quotation
and
two
or
three
more
in
the
opinion
suggest
that
they
don't
want
to
reexamine
the
evidence.
they
want
to
defer
to
jurors
as
long
as
they're
acting
lawfully
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
they
do
not
want
to
substitute
their
judgment
as
that
of
a
thirteenth
juror.
when
mr.
frey
said,
imagine
a
bench
trial,
i
think
he
put
himself
in
the
mindset
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
said
it
didn't
want
to
imagine.
we
don't
want
to
imagine
what
we
as
judges
would
have
done
here.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
exclusively
by
he
size
of
the
verdict
against
the
backdrop
of
the
record,
that
is
true.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
because
in
lane
v.
stewart
in
1960,
a
case
that
they
cite
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
such
review,
what
the
court
says
is,
we
find
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
this
verdict,
and
we
reject
the
idea
that
we
are
free
to
set
it
aside
because
its
mere
size,
i
take
it
independent
of
that
evidence,
somehow
indicates
something
wrong.
but
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
what
is
the
evidence
for
that
proposition,
is
the
foley
case
in
oregon...
it's
dictum,
but
it's
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
in
1972...
the
brewer
case
in
1983
in
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
and
quite
interestingly,
van
lom
itself.
that
is,
van
lom
said,
it's
an
open
question
whether
this
kind
of
review
survives.
they
didn't
exterminate
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
been
in
the
oregon
law
since
1862.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in
fowler
v.
courtemanche
at
page
275
the
court
uses
the
phrase,
substantial
evidence,
justice
ginsburg.
let
me
answer
your
question,
justice
scalia,
in
this
additional
way.
this
entire
case
has
been
tried
since
1989
on
the
premise
that
that
kind
of
review
is
available.
if
you
look
at
the
new
trial
and
jnov
briefs
it's
absolutely
clear
what
happened
there.
they
were
asking
for
passion
or
prejudice
review.
we
didn't
fight
the
fact
that
there
was
authority
to
grant
it.
we
answered
on
the
merits.
in
their
brief,
filed
below
on,
i
believe
it
was
june
22nd,
1989,
they
make
quite
a
bit
of
the
fact
that
oberg
does
not
dispute
the
authority
of
the
oregon
courts
to
engage
in
passion
or
prejudice
review.
we
didn't
dispute
it.
we
have
never
disputed
it.
it's
been
in
this
case.
they
simply...
there
was
no
indication
of
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
sure.
that's
right.
i
mean,
precisely
what
it
means,
i
can't
say,
but--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
honestly
don't.
i
think
the...
as
i
understand
the
plurality
opinion
in
txo,
the
notion
of
gross
excess,
though
it's
a
different
verbal
formulation,
really
has
to
mean
excess
in
relation
to
something,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion.
nothing
is
excessive
in
itself.
i
was
earlier
remembering
this
business
where
the
emperor
says
of
mozart,
you
know,
too
many
notes.
well,
which
ones
do
you
want
me
to
remove,
your
majesty?
i
mean,
too
many
for
what,
and
the...
i
think
the
test,
and
we
all
grapple
for
verbal
formulations
of
it...
i
think
the
test
ultimately,
whether
it's
gross
excessiveness,
or
infection
by
something
other
than
rational
processes
reasoning
from
the
evidence,
ultimately
comes
to
the
same
thing,
and
it's
essentially
a
federal
test.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
it's
less,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
different
in
this
respect.
when
the
oregon
supreme
court
said,
we
occupy
a
lonely
eminence,
we
were
comparing
themselves
to
those
states,
and
they
are
many,
that
do
weight-of-the-evidence
review,
not
quite
thirteenth-juror
in
every
case,
but
substantial
reexamination
on
whether
something
was
adequately
supported
in
the
evidence.
it's
really
a
new
trial
standard
with
respect
to
facts.
oregon
won't
go
that
far.
that
is,
the
oregon
reexamination
bar
is
more
stringent
than
the
seventh
amendment's
reexamination
bar
in
the
sense
that
even
though
at
common
law
one
could
undermine
a
jury
verdict
by
disagreeing
with
it
in
effect,
in
certain
limited
circumstances,
as
long
as
one
had
made
a
directed
verdict
motion
first.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
mean
to
be
sort
of
slicing
the
salami
too
fine,
but
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
exactly
is
it
that
procedural
due
process
supposedly
entitles
you
to
that
oregon
won't
give
you?
oregon--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--absolutely.
what
the
oregon
court
would
say...
it's
said
it
many
times
about
other
provisions
of
the
oregon
constitution...
we
interpret
that
constitutional
provision
consistent
with
our
obligations
under
federal
law.
van
lom,
which
is
a
decision
from
1949,
says
you
can't
reexamine
facts.
the
oregon
supreme
court
i'm
sure
would
say
we
don't
have
to--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
they
provided
no
judicial
method
of
enforcing
the
federal
constitution
itself--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
honest
answer,
justice
stevens,
is
i
do
not
know.
i
don't
think
court
has
ever
held--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
in
this
case,
the
oregon
courts...
the
judgment
you
are
reviewing
is
a
judgment
in
which
the
oregon
courts
purported
to
say...
they
only
referred
to
article
vii,
section
3
in
one
footnote
in
van
lom.
they
said,
it
treats
damages
as
a
factual
matter,
and
we
recognize
that,
but
that
does
not
prevent
us
from
applying
haslip
and
looking
at
the
reasonableness
of
this
judgment
in
light
of
the
policies
of
this
rather
detailed
statute,
and
they
even
said
that
they
would
implement
the
statute
by
requiring
substantial
evidence
of
all
its
elements.
so
we
do
not
have
a
case
where
the
state
of
oregon
has
a
constitutional
provision
that
on
its
face,
or
as
construed,
says,
we
will
not
reverse
a
verdict
that
is
federally
excessive.
remember
what
article
vii
says.
it
says,
we
will
not
reexamine
a
fact
found
by
a
jury--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
that
is--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there's
language
in
van
lom
to
that
effect.
the
roberti's
house
of
wines
case
in
1985--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
that's
what
they
say.
if
they
say
that
we
don't
care
about
the
amount--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
that
we
don't
care
about
it
even
if
it
is
grossly
excessive
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
constitution.
i
suppose
that
would
be
defiance
of
the
supremacy
clause.
that
would
be
relatively
easy.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
would
be
constitutional.
i
think
it
would
be
a
matter
for
oregon
and
the
allocation
of
power
between
judges
and
juries,
rather
as
you
said
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
cloverleaf.
it's
a
matter
of
oregon's
governmental
structure
to
decide
how
it
will
effectuate
principles
that
are
optional
with
oregon.
that
is,
if
oregon
gives
more
than
the
federal
constitution
requires.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose
if
oregon
said,
for
example,
no
damages
above
$10
million
are
lawful,
but
we'll
allow
you
to
award
damages
of
$11
million,
i
would
say
they've
rewritten
their
law.
that
is,
the
state
is
keeping
its
promise.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
