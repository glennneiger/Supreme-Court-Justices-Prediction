justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
morrison,
am
i
correct
that
your
germaneness
argument
is
not
based
on
the
notion
that
there
is
some
inherent
requirement
that
you
cannot
give
a
single
person
duties
that
are
so...
that
are
too
diverse,
but
is
rather
based
upon
the
notion
that
congress
has
not
chosen
to
give
this
person
these
sorts
of
duties?
in
other
words,
it
would
be
all
right
in
your
mind
if
congress...
if
congress
said
all
military
officers
shall
do
the
following
duties,
and
then
listed
everything
including
the
judicial
officers.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
now,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
correct.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
congress
has
also,
has
it
not,
made
clear
since
1968
that
any
person
who
is
commissioned
as
an
officer
in
the
military
forces
runs
a
risk
of
becoming
a
judicial
officer,
may
be
designated
a
judicial
officer.
so,
certainly,
once
the
'68
statute
was
passed,
anyone
who
received
an
officer's
commission
knew
that
one
of
the
duties
of
being
an
officer
could
be
to
be
a
judicial
officer.
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's
fine.
but
congress
certainly
envisioned
that
any
military...
or
you
could
also
say
there
are
certain
requirements
for
other
particular.
to
be
a
medical
officer,
for
example,
of
course
you
have
to
be
a
doctor.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
fact
is
that
congress
anticipated
that
the
military
commission
would
be
enough
to
authorize
that
person
to
be
a
judicial
officer,
once
the
'68
act
was
in
effect.
now,
with
respect
to
judicial
officers
before
'68,
i
can
understand
your
relevance
argument.
but
surely
there...
are
there
any
judicial
officers
functioning
today
who
were
commissioned
prior
to
1968?
i
would
doubt
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
morrison,
i
thought
you
gave
me
the
opposite
answer.
i
thought
you
told
me
that
there
is
no
inherent
disability
for
congress
defining
an
office
so
broadly
that
it
could
include
becoming
a
judicial
officer.
so
certainly--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
least
one
other
solution
is
for
congress
to
say,
whenever
a
military
officer
is
commissioned,
that
officer
will
be
competent
to
become
a
judge
under...
under
this
96...
1968
law.
so
long
as
he
has
the
other
legal
qualifications,
you
would
acknowledge
that
that's
good
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
do
you
also
assume--
--couldn't
congress--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
and
my
point
is
it
seems
to
me
congress
has
done
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
once
the
1968
act
was
passed,
in
effect
that's
what
congress
has
said.
it's
right
there
on
the
statute
books.
it's
clear
that
anybody
who's
appointed
as
an
officer
can
become
a
judicial
officer
so
long
as
he
has
the
legal
qualifications.
it
seems
to
me
you're...
you're
really
relying
upon
the
technical
fact
that
congress
did
not
write
it
all
into
one
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
point.
is
your
point
that
congress
cannot
regard
two
functions
as
being
very
different
and
nonetheless
by
one
commission
authorize
the
same
person
to
perform
those
two
very
different
functions?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
can't
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress...
what
is
correct?
congress
can
do
that.
it
can
say
by
this
commission
you
will
be
a...
authorized
to
be
a
government
physician
and
also
to
dig
ditches
for
the
government,
right?
congress
could
do
that
if
it
wanted
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
the
only
question
is
whether
the
1968
legislation
doesn't
do
that...
doesn't
do
that
clearly
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
so.
but
that
only
demonstrates
the
jobs
are
very
different.
the
point
is
congress
by
its
1968
legislation
nonetheless
expect
military...
expected
military
officers
to
do
both
of
those
jobs.
and
you've
told
me
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
expect
people
to
dig
ditches
and
be
physicians.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
interpret
that...
you
attribute
that
interpretation
to
congress,
although
it
needn't...
it
need
not.
i
mean,
the
other
interpretation
is
that
congress
said
one
commission
will
enable
you
to
be
both,
you
know,
a
line
officer
and
a
judge.
that's
the
other
interpretation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
want
us
to
take
your
interpretation
in
order
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional?
i
mean
we
normally--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
normally
do
the
opposite.
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
they
never
considered
the
constitutional
ramifications.
there
are
no
constitutional
ramifications
if
congress
chooses
to
create
one
office
by
one
appointment
that
is
so
broad
that
it
includes
both
being
a
line
officer
and
being
a
judge.
it
can
do
that.
there
are
no
constitutional
ramifications,
so
why
would
they
have
to
consider
the
constitutional
ramifications?
the
only
question
is
whether
they
chose
to
create
such
an
office,
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
reading
the
1968
statute,
they
did.
now,
there's
a
problem
with
respect
to
officers
commissioned
before
'68,
i
acknowledge.
do
you
know
whether
any
of
the
officers
involved
in
these
particular
cases
were
commissioned
before
'68?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
before--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
not
asserting
that
the
executive
branch
could,
on
its
own,
simply
have
the
head
of
the
department
appoint
them?
i
mean,
that
would
cure
it,
but
you'd
need
statutory
authorization
for
that,
wouldn't
you?
i
mean
so
the
consequence
would
be
that
you
simply
cannot
appoint
any
of
these
civilian
judges
until
the
statute's
amended.
is
that
what
you
think
the
consequence
is?
or
do
you
think
the
consequence
is
without
amending
the
statute,
the
secretary
of
transportation
can
make
the
appointment?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
latter.
and,
unlike
mr.
morrison,
you
don't
believe
that
they
are
appointments
to
a
superior
office
within
the
meaning
of
the
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
one
could
say...
one
could
say
that
that's
closer
to
being
a
juror
that
being
a
judge,
and
one
of
the
footnotes
in
mr.
morrison's
brief
does
bring
up
justice
jackson's
wonderful
quotation
regarding
the
word
"quasi"
and
you
do
have
to
use
that
throughout
your
brief,
that
these
are
quasi-judicial
functions.
i
think
you
have
to
concede
that
prior
to
1968
there
was
no
purely
judicial
function
that
a
military
officer
performed.
is
that
not
accurate?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
certainly
think
it's
easy
to
say
that
after
1968,
because
it
was
clear
on
the
face
of
the
united
states
code
that
if
you
were
a
military
officer
you
might
have
to
do
that.
prior
to
'68,
it
wasn't
clear
that
you
ever
had
to
be
a
judge.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was...
i
was
exploring
with
mr.
morrison
the
possibility
of
deciding
this
case
on
that...
on
that
narrower
ground,
but
i
guess
that
poses
a
problem.
there
are
probably
some
court-martial
convictions
that
were
handed
down
by
panels
or
by
judges
that
were
appointed
before
commissioned...
before
1968.
and
i
guess
those
things
would
be
left
in
jeopardy,
wouldn't
they,
if
we
decided--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
really
want
to
rest
your
case
on
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
that,
in
all
respect,
the
military
system
is...
i
mean,
for
example
we
don't
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
of
citizens
at
large
in
the
military,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
certainly
a
less
significant
procedural
protection.
but
it's
always
been
that
way
in
the
military,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
it
conforms
with
due
process
because
it's
always
been
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
you
have...
you
have
less
rights
of
privacy.
what
might
be
considered
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
in
some
other
context
is
not
in
the
military.
you
just
don't
have
the
same
rights
of
privacy.
and
i
gather
much
of
your
argument
is
simply
that's
the
way
it's
been
for
200
years
and
it's
not
been
considered
a
violation
of
due
process.
