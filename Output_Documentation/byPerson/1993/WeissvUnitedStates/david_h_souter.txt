justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
morrison,
with
respect
to
trial
judges,
however,
would
you
go
back
and
just
help
me
out
on
a
matter
of
fact?
you
said
a
second
ago...
i
think
you
said
a
second
ago,
in
passing,
that
a
military
judge
was
indispensable
to
a
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
is
it
correct
that
with
respect
to
the
two
higher
grades
of
court-martial,
a
judge
may
not
sit
alone
without
the
consent
of
the
accused?
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
unless
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
unless,
though...
unless
the
accused
consents
of
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence.
and
i
assume
the
determination
of
punishment
would
be
made
by
a
panel,
only
one
of
whom
presumably
would
be
a
military
judge.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
that
simply
go
to
the
constitutionality
of
those
particular
appointments?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's...
that's
right,
it
does
not
explain
that
and
he
was
not
purporting
to
explain
that.
he's
simply
explaining
the
relationship
between
those
who
are
officers
and
those
who
function
as
judges,
and
the
appointment
of
civilians
may
be
an
entirely
separate
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
assuming,
i
take
it,
throughout,
mr.
morrison,
that
both
the...
both
the
judges,
as
well
as
the
commissioned
officers
as
such,
are
all
inferior
officers.
there's
no
suggestion
in
your
argument
that
a
military
judge
is
a
superior
officer
within
the
meaning
of
the
appointments
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
don't
acknowledge
that,
do
you...
is
your
answer
different
to
that...
your
germaneness
argument,
depending
on
whether
we're
talking
about
assigning
duties
assumed
to
be
germane
of
a
superior
office
to
an
inferior
officer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
realize
that.
but
you're...
you're
also
assuming
that
there
is
no
further
particular
value
to
be
served
in
enforcing
the
particular
appointment
of
superior
officers
to
that
office
as
such.
you're
saying
you're
assuming
that
the
only
value
to
be
served
is
to
get
congress
involved
or
congress
and
the
president
involved,
and
you're
assuming
that
there
is
no
further
value
to
be
served
by
the
appointments
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
are
in
doubt
on
the
point
of
classification,
do
we
owe
deference
to
congress
in
the
implicit
classification
that
congress
seems
to
have
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
military
context
have
any
bearing
on
the
answer
to
that
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
you...
excuse
me.
you
don't...
you
take
the
position
that
the
military
context
really
has
no
bearing
on
the
due
process
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
your...
once
again,
your
germaneness
argument
does
not
assume
that
there
could
be
assignment
of
an
inferior
office
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
superior
office?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would...
under
your
view,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
we
don't
have
to
resolve
medina
or
mathews,
we
just
go
to
middendorf.
justice
david
h.
souter
general,
even
if
you
take
it
outside
the
military
context,
i
think
what
you're
describing
is
a
closer
approach
to
insulation
than
would
be
true,
for
example,
between
the
decisions
of
elected
state
court
judges
and
the
electorate.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it's
basically
a
prospectivity
doctrine,
and
not
a
doctrine
that
goes
to
the
merits.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it's
basically
a
prospectivity
doctrine.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there...
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
