mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
method
by
which
military
trial
and
appeals
judges
are
appointed
is
consistent
with
the
appointments
clause
of
the
constitution.
all
of
the
judges
in
petitioners'--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
this
court's
decision
in
freytag
in
1991
caused
a
recognition
that
the
appointments
clause
had
ramifications
beyond
what
people
had
considered
it
before.
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
i
was
not
there
when
the
issue
was
first
raised,
but
that
is
my
understanding.
all
of
the
judges
in
petitioners'
cases
were
commissioned
officers.
all
of
them
were
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
but
the
commissions
that
they
received
were
commissions
as
military
officers
and
not
as
judicial
officers,
and
the
question
presented
is
whether
that
appointment
satisfies
the
appointments
clause
for
their
judicial
positions.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
i'm
distinguishing...
the
question
is
whether,
in
order
to
fill
the
judicial
offices
which
they
hold
as
trial...
military
trial
judges
or
military
appeals
judges,
whether
they
have
to
receive
a
separate
appointment
under
the
appointments
clause.
that
is
the
question.
i
recognize
they
do
not
have
to
be
article
iii
judges.
there's
no
question
about
that
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no.
i
simply
indicated,
your
honor,
to
fill
the
fill
judicial
office
which...
i
thought
i
said
judicial
office,
not
officer,
your
honor,
but
the
office
which
they
hold.
and
as
your
honor
will
note,
in
the
addendum
to
our
brief
there
are
separate
certificates
appointing
each
of
these
persons
to
a
judicial
office,
and
that
is
why
i
use
that
particular
term,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
it
does
not
apply
to
the
marine
corps;
it
does
apply
to
the
army
and
the
navy
and
the
air
force.
that
narrows
the
group
of
people
from
all
of
the
officers
in
the
military
down
to
about
1,650
officers
who
are
law
officers.
of
that,
only
3
percent
are
either
military
trial
judges
or
military
appellate
judges:
91
trial
judges,
and
about
31
appeals
judges.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
believe
they
now
are
in
any
event,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
principal
reason,
your
honor,
and
this
is
the
heart
of
our
argument,
is
that
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
only
certain
people,
those
who
are
appointed
as
judges,
can
perform
the
major
functions
that
judges
perform
in
the
military:
presiding
over
general
and,
in
most
cases,
special
court-martials;
deciding
on
whether
evidence
will
be
admitted;
ruling
on
challenges
for
cause;
instructing
the
jury;
ruling
on
matters
of...
other
matters
that
come
before
such
as
preliminary
motions.
and
most
important
of
all,
only
a
military
judge
can
decide
in
a
special
or
general
court-martial
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused
and
can
pass
sentence.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
statute
governing
the
military
that
restricts
what
legal
officers
can
do.
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
am
advised
that
persons
who
have
the
legal
officer
designation
do
perform
other
legal
duties,
and
no
one,
except
the
judges,
performs
judging
duties.
no
one
other
than
the
31
members
of
the
courts
of
military
review
sit
and
decide
the
appeals
that
come
to
them
with
the
quite
extraordinary
powers
of
appellate
jurisdiction
in
the
military.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no.
i
said,
your
honor,
that
only
a
military
trial
judge
sitting
alone
could
find
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
special
and
general
court-martials.
the
government
points
to
the
fact
that
in
summary
court-martials
a
nonjudge
could
sit,
but
this
court
has
held
in
middendorf
against
henry
that
those
summary
court-martials
are
not
criminal
proceedings.
in
any
event,
are
very
different
in
terms
of
the
punishment
that--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
not
the
consent
of
the
government.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
not
the
consent
of
the
government.
that's
not
required.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
except
the
last...
i
agree
with
it
except
the
last
part.
the
military
judge
does
not
sit
on
that
panel.
the
judge
is
as
a
judge
in
the
civilian
court
system,
acting
as
a
judge
instructing
the
panel
members.
in
the...
in
the
old
days
when
we
had
law...
when
there
were
law
officers
in
the
military,
the
law
officer
would,
in
some
cases,
sit
as
an
advisor.
but
now
the
president
of
the
court-martial
is
not
the
chief...
is
not
the
judge,
and
the
judge
does
not
vote
on
guilt
or
innocence
unless
the
case
is
referred
to
the
judge.
which
approximately...
i
don't
have
the
exact
figures,
but
a
very
high
percentage
of
cases
are
tried
before
military
judges
alone.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
the
military
not
only
do
officers
serve
on
court-martials,
but
in
limited
circumstances
enlisted
personnel
can
serve
on
court
martials.
there
are
a
series
of
rules
about
that,
but
they
are
eligible.
and
we
would...
we
would
contend
that
that
is
germane,
in
the
government's
phraseology,
to
other
military
duties,
principally
because
there
is
no
special
qualifications.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
say
that's...
that
is
substantially
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
with
two
caveats...
may
i?
two.
the
first
is
that
it
isn't
simply
that
congress
hasn't
said
they
may
do
it.
the
congress
has
said
the
opposite.
it
has
said
only
those
persons
who
are
designated
judges
may
perform
the
following
functions.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
so
it's
a
little
stronger
than
your
honor
hypothesized.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
under
article
26,
only
persons
who
are
members
of
the
bar
can
become
a
judicial
officer,
and
they
must
also
be
certified
by
the
judge
advocate
general
of
their
service
in
order
to
become
a
judicial
officer.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
but
there
are
probably
officers
who
were
commissioned
prior
to
1968
who
are
still
serving
as
judicial
officers,
some
of
the
most
senior
grades.
but,
your
honor,
i
think
i'm
not
understanding
your
question,
because
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
rather
the
opposite.
that
is,
it
seemed
to
me
that
until
1968
anyone
might
have
served
as
a
law
officer
because
there
were
no
special
qualifications
embodied
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
as
there
are
now.
after
1968
a
very
narrow
group
of
people
is
now
even
eligible
in
congress'
view,
that
is
those
who
are
admitted
to
a
bar.
and
then
they
must,
in
addition,
be
certified
by
the
judge
advocate
general
before
they
can
be
law
officers...
because
they
can
be
judicial
officers.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
as
a
judicial
officer,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
i
would
say...
it's
almost
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
remark
earlier
about
why
this
didn't
happen
right
after
1968.
i
would
say
that
if
they
went
back
to
the
19...
pre-1968
system,
that
there
would
be
no
appointments
clause
problem
because
people
would
not
be
serving
in
judicial
offices
because
the
functions
were
very
different.
that
is,
the
person
who
was
a
law
officer
was
simply
an
advisor.
the
court
could
disregard
his
or
her--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
your
honor.
i
can't
think
of
any,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
exclude--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
and
i
would
say,
your
honor,
it's
not
a
large
matter
because
there
are
only
31
appeals
judges
and
91
trial
judges
who
serve
for
periods
of
time,
and
the
burden
would
be
very
minimal
in
order
to
comply
with
the
appointments
clause.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
i
think--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--so
long
as
he
has
the
other
legal
qualifications.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
is
a
member
of
the
bar.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think...
i
think
that
would
be
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
scheme
that
congress
has
envisioned,
and
i
perhaps
answered
your
question
too
hastily.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
congress
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
views
the
persons
serving
as
judges
as
different
from
other
military
officers,
both
because
they
must
all
be
members
of
the
bar
and
because
they
all
must
be
certified
as
qualified
by
the
judge
advocate
general.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
they're
not
certified
by
the
judge
advocate
general.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
a
special
procedure.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and,
your
honor,
it's
very
important.
there
are
several
instructions
and
regular
procedures
under
which
very
few
people,
group
of
people,
3
percent
of
all
persons
in
the
military...
military
judge
advocate
general's
corps
become
judges.
and
part
of
the
reason
is
because
most
lawyers
in
the
military
do
not
participate
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
i
agree
with
your
honor's
question.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
breadth
of
it
takes...
makes
me
taken
aback
a
little,
but
i
think
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
it
could
if
it
did
so
clearly,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
scheme...
i
don't
think
that's
the
scheme
that
congress
set
up.
the
whole
purpose,
if
you
read
the
legislative
history...
the
goal
behind
it,
and
it's
reflected
in
the
statute,
was
to
create
a
judiciary
in
the
military
that
was
much
more
like
the
civilian
judiciary
than
had
ever
been
true
in
the
past.
the
judges
were
given
new
responsibilities.
they
were
given
for
the
first
time
the
opportunity
to
try
cases.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--there
is
a
further
difficulty
with
that
theory,
your
honor,
and
there
is
nothing
to
support
the
theory
that
that's
what
congress
was
doing,
and
the
government
has
not
contended
otherwise.
one
of
the
difficulties
the
government
has
in
defending
this
statute
on
its
germaneness
argument
is
that
for
courts
of
military
review,
that
is
the
appeals
judges,
a
person
need
not
be
a
member
of
the
military.
and
there
are
presently--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
your
honor,
and
let
me
say
why
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
would
be...
it
might
be
severable,
but
i
think
it
goes...
it
goes
to
the
question
about
whether...
as
justice
scalia
has
suggested,
that
what
congress
did
in
1968
was
to
say
that
everyone
who
is
a
military
officer
can
be
a
judge,
and
we
equate
the
two.
that
cannot
explain
how
civilians
can
become
judges.
there
has
to
be
a
separate
method
of
appointment
and
a
separate
theory.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
but
i
suggest
rather
like
the
13th
stroke
of
the
clock,
it
undermines
the
theory
that
this
is
simply
what
congress
did
in
1968.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think,
though,
that
in
trying
to
understand
what
congress
was
doing
and
whether
what
congress
was
doing
was
what
i
believe
they
were
doing,
which
was
to
establish
a
separate
judicial
office
in
the
military
for
which
only
a
very
few
people
would
become
eligible
and
would
be
chosen
to
serve
by
a
process
that
would
take
place
in
the
military,
that
congress
was
recognizing
that
there
was
a
difference
and
they
wanted
them
treated
differently,
and
what
congress
failed
to
do
was
to
provide
for
their
separate
appointment.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
one--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--because
i
think
it's
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it's
the
most
obvious
interpretation.
but
the
government
argument...
under
the
government's
argument,
and
there's
no...
there's...
the
government
contends
that
under
its
theory
anyone
who's
a
military
officer,
an
infantry
officer,
a
pilot,
a
dentist,
a
chaplain,
a
supply
officer,
all
of
those
could
be
judges
without
a
separate
appointment
because
they're
all
military
officers.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
did
not
have
that
in
mind
at
all
remotely,
and
that
its
requirement
that
there
be
a
separate
selection
in
article
26
made
it
clear
that
what
congress
wanted
was
a
separate
judiciary.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
clear
that
congress
didn't.
there's
no--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
only...
there's
no
evidence
that
they--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
your
honor,
in
fairness
to
the
congress
and
in
recognition
of
what
has
happened,
the
appointments
clause
was
largely,
not
entirely,
dormant
until
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
in
1976.
and
just
as
congress
did
not
focus
on
many
things,
there's
no
evidence
that
they
focused
at
all
on
the
appointments
clause
question
at
any
time.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
right.
it
was
not
a
conscious
choice
to
not
provide
for
it;
they
just
simply
never
considered
it.
they
never
considered
the
constitutional
ramifications
of
creating--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i've
been
through
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
and
i've
never...
i've
seen
no
mention
of
any
consideration
of
the
appointments
clause.
now,
it's
true
i
can't
go
into
the
mind
of
every
member
of
all
the
armed
services
committee.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it's
my
understanding
that
they
were
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
in
any
event,
i
would
have
to
say
that
all
of
them
had
been
promoted,
which
required
a
separate
confirmation,
since
that
time.
i
mean,
so
i
wouldn't--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--they
do
not.
those
are
only
the
coast
guard.
they
do
involve
persons
in
the...
who
were
not
appointed
to
the
judge
advocate
general
corps.
that
is
that
the...
both
of
these
trials
were
before
marine
officers
who
do
not
have,
as
justice
kennedy
noted
earlier,
separate
appointments
under...
under
the...
under
the
constitution.
under
the
appointments,
that
is.
they
are
appointed
as
line
officers
in
the
marine...
marine
corps,
and
they're
not
law
designated.
but
under
justice
scalia's
approach,
that
would
not...
not
matter.
and,
in
addition,
two
of
the
judges
on
the
courts
of
military
review
who
sat
on
these
panels
were
also
marine
officers.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
acknowledge
that.
and
the
reason
i--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
since
all
of
the
judges
here
were
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent...
that
is,
inferior
officers
can
be
appointed
that
way
also.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no.
and
i
thank
you,
justice
souter.
i
actually
would
say
that
that
is
an
additional
value
when
we're
talking
about
separate
superior
officer;
certainly,
the
judges
on
the
courts
of
military
review
whose
decisions
are
reviewable
by
the
court
of
military
appeals,
a
civilian
court
as
opposed
to
a
military
court
are
superior
officers.
only
3
percent
of
their
cases
ever
get
to
the
court
of
military
appeals.
and
i
would
say
that
the
trial
judges
are
superior
officers,
not
inferior
officers,
as
well.
i
analogize
them
to
the
judges
of
the
tax
court.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
wasn't
relevant.
it
is
not
dispositive
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
was
pressed
below.
it
is
in
my
brief.
i
made
this
specific
argument,
and
the
government
challenged
on
xx.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure.
i
did
not...
i
did
not
rerean
the
briefs
with
that
in
mind.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
think
that
in
morrison
against
olson
that
argument
was
made,
and
the
court
did
not
accept
it.
i
believe
the
court
decided
that
it
was
up
to
the
court
to
decide,
under
the
constitutional
scheme,
whether
an
office
was
an
inferior
or
superior
office.
obvioasly,
congress
has
a
role
in
defining
the
terms
of
the
office.
but--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
except
insofar
as
the
congress
has
an
important
role
in
defining
the
military
and
establishing
offices.
but
i
believe--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
i
don't
say
it
has
no
bearing
at
all,
your
honor.
in
fact,
if
there
had
been
an
argument
made
of
military
necessity
here,
we
would
have
to
take
that
argument
very
seriously.
the
government
has
never
made
such
an
argument
in
the
trial
court,
never
made
it
before
congress.
congress
surely
didn't
make
a
considered
judgment
as
it
made...
as
the
state
legislature
made
in
medina
or
as
congress
made
in
middendorf
against
henry.
congress,
on
the...
as
far
as
the
term
of
office
argument
is
concerned,
has
never
expressed
any
reason,
and
today,
even
in
this
court,
the
only
reason
on
the
term
of
office
issue
raised
by
the
government
is
that
excessively
long
terms
of
office
would
interfere
with
career
paths.
we
have
never
suggested
that
there
need
to
be
excessively
long
terms
of
office.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
yes.
justice
souter
asked
me
about
it,
so
i
thought
it
would
be
appropriate
at
this
time
to
move
over
to
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
view
it
as
a
technical
violation.
i
view
it
as
a
violation
of
the
appointments
clause
and
i
view
it
as
important
because
what's
happened
is
that
we
have
transferred
the
appointing
power
for
very
important
people,
trial
and
appellate
judges,
from
persons
under
the
constitution
who
are
supposed
to
do
the
appointing...
from
them
to
the
judge
advocate
general,
who
is
a
mid-level
officer
in
the
navy
and
marine
corps.
and
i
do
not
view
that
as
a
technical
violation.
i
believe
it's
an
improper
diffusion
of
power
of
the
kind
that
this
court
has
been
concerned
about
in
appointments
clause
cases
before.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
not
necessarily.
the
department
head
could
be
the
loser.
the
secretary
of
defense
would
be--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
but
we've
never...
that's
never
been
a
question
before.
that
the
appointments
clause
was
intended
to
protect
the
people,
as
this
court
said
in
freytag,
and
not
simply
the
president.
that
it
was
intended
to
assure
accountability
and
prevent
the
diffusion
of
power.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
less
protection
for
appointments
clause
purposes,
yes,
yes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
government's
basic
submission
on
the
appointments
clause
issue
is
that
military
judges
are
no
different
from
military
officers.
we
think
that
that
is
not
what
congress
meant.
that's
not
what
congress
wrote
in
article
26
and
it's
not
what
congress
enacted
in
specifying
who
can
perform
the
function
of
military
trial
and
appellate
judges.
second,
in
addition
to
the
coast
guard,
the
navy
has
had
civilians
on
the
courts
of
military
review.
none
recently:
i
believe
the
last
one
was
in
the
early
1970's.
third,
while
we
dispute
vigorously
with
the
justice
department
the
applicability
of
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
as
it
applies
to
direct
appeals,
we
recognize
that
it
may
have
considerable
force
in
the
context
of
habeas
corpus
or
collateral
attack,
assuming
that
there
was...
that
teague
itself
did
not
prevent
the
overturning
of
military
court-martials
of
many
years.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
de
facto.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
de
facto
officer,
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
and
last,
the
government
talks
on
the
due
process
issue
about
this
time-honored
practice,
200
years.
well,
we
haven't
had
military
judges
for
200
years,
so
the
time
to
start
counting
is
1968,
and
since
that
time
that's
the
first
time
we've
had
anybody
that
has
terms
of
office.
what
they
forget,
of
course,
is
that
the
time-honored
practice
every
place
except
in
the
military
is
for
those
persons
who
are
performing
judicial
functions
to
have
some
term
of
office,
to
have
some
kind
of
protection
about
the
very
concerns
that
justice
kennedy
and
others
have
spoken
about
here.
the
government
says
deference,
deference,
deference.
but
it
doesn't
say
deferent
to
what,
other
than
the
fact
that
they
haven't
done
anything.
there's
not
a
single
reason
advanced,
a
single
military
policy
or
military
necessity
that
can
form
the
basis
of
reliance
on
this
deference,
and
for
that
reason
we
believe
that
due
process,
as
well
as
the
appointments
clause,
has
been
violated.
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
convictions.
thank
you,
your
honor.
