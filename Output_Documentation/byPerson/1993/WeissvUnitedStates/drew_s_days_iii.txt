mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
cases
present
the
question
of
whether
the
military
is
required
by
the
constitution
to
alter
procedures
and
practices
bearing
on
the
operation
of
its
system
of
courts-martial
that
have
been
in
place
for
over
200
years.
it
is
a
system
designed
for
a
multitude
of
circumstances
in
peacetime,
at
war,
on
battleships,
in
submarines,
and
on
land.
these
several
practices
have
been
established
and
maintained
by
the
congress
and
the
president
in
faithful
discharge
of
powers
granted
by
the
constitution.
with
respect
to
the
appointments
clause
argument
that
petitioners
make,
it's
our
view
that
congress
did
expect
that
qualified
military
officers
would
serve
as
military
judges
at
some
point
during
their
careers.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
justice
o'connor.
that
particular
provision
was
included
in
the
act
at
the
request
of
the
coast
guard.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
because
of
resource
limitations.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honor,
that
issue
was
raised
in
the
carpenter
case,
as
to
whether
there
could
be
an
appointment
of
a
civilian
without
going
through
the
requirements
imposed
by
the
appointments
clause.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
and
the
answer
is
that
those
judges
have
to
be
appointed
by
a
head
of
department;
in
that
case,
the
head
of
the
transportation
department,
the
secretary
of
transportation.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
believe
it
is,
yes.
oddly
enough--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
latter.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
do
not.
no,
our
position
is
that
they're
inferior
officers.
they
are
responsible
to
higher
executive
officials.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
justice
souter,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
appropriate.
i
think
that
as--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
would
create
appointments
clause
problems,
yes.
the
fact
is
that
in
the
military
a
second
appointment
is
not
required
by
the
constitution,
because
military
officers
are
expected
during
their
careers
to
undertake
the
function
of
a
military
judge
at
some
point.
usually
the
service
term
is
between
2
and
4
years,
but
it's
also
true
that
people
who
are
commissioned
as
judge
advocate
general
officers
serve
as
trial
counsel,
as
defense
counsel,
as
legal
advisors,
as
staff
judge
advocates.
they
perform
a
variety
of
functions
as
law
officers
within
the
military.
it's
also
important
to
point
out
that
the
military
regulatory
structure
anticipates
that
any
commissioned
officer,
even
an
officer
lacking
qualifications
to
become
a
military
judge,
may
at
some
point
be
called
on
to
perform
quasi-judicial
functions.
take,
for
example,
the
role
of
the
convening
authority.
that's
not
a
job
that
requires
the
person
to
be
a
military
officer,
and
yet
the
convening
authority
in
this
system
has
the
responsibility
for
reviewing
decisions
that
are
made
at
the
court.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
an
officer,
certainly,
would
have
to
be
a
convening
officer.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
right,
be
a
lawyer,
for
example.
we
have
the
summary
court-martial
situation
that
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
morrison.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
right.
it's
really
a
commanding
officer,
and
that
person
is
responsible
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
for,
under
proper
circumstances,
convening
a
court-martial
to
inquire
into
charges
against
a
person
in
the
military.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
in
effect,
although
there
is
a
procedure,
an
article
32
procedure
that's
more
akin
to
the
grand
jury.
but
in
any
event,
what
the
convening
authority
does
is
conclude
that
there
are
proper
circumstances
presented
to
request
the
setting
up
of
a
court-martial,
either
a
special
court-martial
or
a
general
court-martial.
but
i
think
it's--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
right,
in
article
15.
but
after
the
trial
is
completed,
the
convening
authority
has
the
ability
to
review
the
sentence
that
has
been
handed
down
in
the
court-martial
and
exercise
clemency,
so
that
there
is
a
role
for
the
convening
authority
that
is
a
judicial
role
in
some
respects,
even
though
he's
not
or
she
is
not
a
military
officer.
and
it's
also
true
in
a
special
court-martial
situation
that
there
can
be
proceedings
without
a
military
judge
present,
such
that
military
officers...
and
in
some
cases
there
can
be
one-third
representation
of
enlisted
personnel
on
a
special
court-martial
to
hear
the
charges
and
decide
on
guilt
or
innocence
and
allocate
sentence.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
the
petitioners
make
the
point
that
there
is
tremendous
authority
reposed
in
a
military
judge.
that
is
certainly
true,
but
it's
also
true
that
prior
to
1968
that
same
power
was
reposed
in
people
who
did
not
have
military
training.
and
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case
is
that
efforts
by
the
military
system
to
upgrade
the
quality
of
its
justice,
if
you
will,
is
being
used
a
basis
for
claiming
that
there's
an
appointments
clause
problem.
certainly,
there
are
many
jobs--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
understand
that,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
i'm
not
suggesting
otherwise.
but
i
do
want
to
make
clear
that
for
200
years
decisions
have
been
made
by
military
officers
in
very
serious
cases,
including
death.
prior
to
1968,
those
decisions
were
made
by
people
without
legal
training
necessarily,
although
in
1948
there
was
a
requirement
that
law
officers
be
legally
trained
and
certified
by
the
judge
advocate
general's
corps.
but
these
very
important
decisions
were
made
by
people
who
did
not
have
legal
training
and
were
not
military
judges.
it's
also
important
to
point
out
that
in
the
military,
military
officers
are
responsible,
literally,
for
life
and
death
decisions
outside
of
the
judicial
process.
we
are
all
lawyers
and
judges,
in
the
case
of
the
court
justices,
but
i
don't
think
we
should
overlook
the
fact
that
a
military
commander
leading
a
ground
squadron
or
in
charge
of
a
bomber
that
has
nuclear
weaponry,
or
the
head
of
a
submarine
military
group
has
any
less
responsibility
for
life
and
death
determinations.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
they
are
not.
but
i
would
assume--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--your
honor,
i
think
that
if
congress...
if
one
follows
the
petitioner's
argument,
if
congress
decided
that
it
was
going
to
set
up
special
qualifications
for
pilots
on
nuclear
bombers,
presumably
that
would
require
a
new
appointment,
given
the
petitioner's
theory.
our
position
is
that
military
officers
have
this
wide-ranging
responsibility.
one
of
those
responsibilities
is
serving
as
a
judicial
officer.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
may
well
be
the
case.
i
simply
don't
know,
justice
scalia.
but
if...
if
one
takes,
for
example,
the
judge
who
sat
in
the
hernandez
case,
the
general
court-martial
case,
he
came
into
the
military
in
1957
or
'58
but
decided,
after
becoming
a
military
officer,
to
go
back
to
law
school,
and
became
a
military
judge
and
began
serving
in
1975.
so
this
is
some
indication
of
patterns
that
have
been
followed
in
the
military
with
respect
to
peopling
and
providing
military
officers
to
serve
in
the
judiciary.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
indeed,
that
is...
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
wanted
to
turn
to
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--your
honor,
i
think
that
we
would
have
to
look
to
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
and
operate
on
the
assumption
that
those
decisions
were
rendered...
those
judgments
were
rendered
in
the
context
of
a
legitimate
process,
and
therefore
public
policy
would
justify
making
those
de
jure
offices
occupied
by,
arguably,
de
facto
officers,
final.
i
wanted
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
due
process
arguments
that
have
been
raised
by
the
petitioners.
the
petitioners
have
invited
this
court
to
engage
in
a
balancing
process
with
respect
to
practices
that
have
been,
as
i've
said
earlier,
in
effect
for
centuries.
we
disagree
with
their
proposition,
namely
that
balancing
is
appropriate.
we
think
that
given
this
court's
many
decisions
recognizing
the
deference
that
is
properly
afforded
to
decisions
made
by
congress
and
the
president
as
commander
in
chief,
with
respect
to
the
governance
of
the
military,
it
suggests
that
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
military
has
the
responsibility
to
come
forward
and
justify
practices
that
are
time
honored.
but
rather
it's
the
responsibility
of
petitioners
to
show
why
their
concerns,
why
their
claims
are
so
extraordinarily
weighty
as
to
overcome
the
balance
already
struck
by
congress.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honor,
we
certainly
would
find
that
appropriate.
although
there
are
arguments,
and
i've
certainly
observed
the
views
of
members
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
medina-mathews
dichotomy.
but
i
think
it
is
instructive
that
after
mathews
was
decided,
this
court
decided
middendorf
a
year
afterward,
and
there
was
no
mention
of
a
mathews
line
of
analysis
in
middendorf.
we
would
suggest,
although
obviously
the
court
is
the
ultimate
determiner
of
this,
that
what
those
decisions
reflect
is
the
fact
that
this
court
saw
a
different
line,
a
different
mode
of
analysis
as
being
appropriate
when
dealing
with
practices
in
the
military
that
are
the
result
of
determinations
made
by
the
president
and
congress.
and
we
would
urge
this
court
to
follow
that
line
of
cases
in
the
dispute
that's
before
this
court
today.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
justice
o'connor,
they
certainly
are
serious,
and
i
think
they
have
been
taken
seriously
by
the
congress
and
by
the
military.
the
petitioners
talk
about
the
lack
of
independence
insofar
as
military
judges
are
concerned
or
courts-martial,
but,
in
fact,
they
seem
to
be
making
an
implied
bias
argument.
and
we
think
that
the
implied
bias
line
of
cases
is
inappropriate
in
the
context
of
the
military
system.
they
rely
upon
tumey
and
ward
and
connally,
and
it
is
our
position
that
military
judges
do
not
have
a
direct
personal
substantial
and
pecuniary
interest
in
the
cases
that
they
sit
on.
certainly
not
as
a
systematic
matter.
after
all,
in
tumey
and
ward
and
many
of
the
other
cases,
it
was
established
that
the
bias
was
a
result
of
the
normal
operation
of
the
schemes
that
were
challenged
there.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
your
honor,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
that
is
appropriate.
what
we've
seen
over
the
years
since
1968
is
an
effort
by
congress
and
the
military
to
isolate
and
insulate
military
judges
from
command
influence.
in
fact,
if
there
is
any
central
purpose--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--there...
i'm
not
certain
about
the
qualification,
but
certainly
there
is
some
risk,
and
there
have
been
concerns
expressed
in
congress
and
the
military
about
this.
and
congress
has
legislated
to
insulate
military
judges
by,
for
example,
making
certain
that
the
fitness
reports
and
the
review
of
the
activities
of
military
judges
is
done
by
the
judge
advocate
general
and
not
by
the
commander.
it
does
not
go
through
the
regular
chain
of
command.
but,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
concede
that
there
are
some
concerns
here,
but
they
are
concerns
that
have
to
be
evaluated
in
the
military
context.
we're
not
talking
about
a
civilian
circumstance.
we're
talking
about
other
demonstrable
and
powerful
needs
of
the
military
that
have
to
be
met.
one,
then,
can
look
at
the
concerns
that
you
pointed
out.
and
my
response
is
that
congress
and
the
military
have
attempted
to
deal
with
those
problems,
and
i
think
has
dealt
with
them
in
a
largely
effective
way.
there's
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
that's
right,
justice
souter,
and
it's
important
to...
also,
to
recognize
that
when
we
talk
about
tenure
provided
to
civilian
judges,
we're
talking
about
protecting
them
from
the
pressures
of
the
political
process.
the
pressures
come
not
only
from
the
people
who
pay
their
salaries,
the
governments
that
pay
their
salaries,
but
the
various
pressures
outside
of
the
courtroom
that
might,
if
there
were
not
proper
protection,
influence
their
judgment.
we
have
a
concern,
as
justice
kennedy
has
pointed
out,
with
command
influence
from
that
side
of
the
equation,
and
there
have
been
efforts
to
deal
with
this.
it
is
not
appropriate
under
the
system
that's
been
established
for
a
superior
officer,
and
certainly
for
a
commander
to
make
any
comments
whatsoever
about
a
military
judge
based
upon
that
military
judge's
decisions.
it
is
not
appropriate.
indeed,
it
is
a
violation
of
the
law
for
anyone
to
try
to
interfere,
to
coerce
or
influence
a
determination
made
by
a
judge.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
in
fact,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
if
one
looks
at
the
system,
although
there
are
points
one
can
identify
that
differ
from
the
civilian
justice
process
arguably
unfavorably,
there
are
procedures
within
the
military
justice
system
that,
in
my
estimation,
are
superior
to
ones
we
encounter
on
the
civilian
side.
i
mentioned
the
article
32
proceeding
where,
unlike
our
grand
juries,
the
accused
is
allowed
to
go
before
the
convening
authority,
or
that
particular
proceeding,
with
a
lawyer
and
hear
the
entire
process.
there
are
also
procedures
having
to
do
with
plea
bargaining
that
are
much
more
rigorous
than
anything
i've
seen
in
the
civilian
context
in
which,
for
example,
the
military
judge
determines,
going
line
by
line
in
a
plea
agreement,
whether
the...
or
a
plea
of
guilty,
whether
the
accused
really
does
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
and,
in
fact,
agrees
with
the
guilty
plea,
in
fact
to
the
point
of
requiring
the
accused
to
go
through
a
narrative
description
of
exactly
what
he
or
she
did.
and
then
the
judge
can
determine--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
i
do
not
want
to.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
or--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--it
has--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
it's
been
a
practice
over
200
years
by
common
consent.
we're
not
talking
about
something
that
has
missed
the
eye
of
the
american
people
or,
indeed,
the
congress
or
the
president.
and
we
think
that
that
history
is
a
powerful
testament
to
its
constitutional
validity.
i
wanted
to
say--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
want
to
minimize
the
impact
of
a
removal
of
a
military
judge,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
military
judges
being
out
on
the
street.
there's
no
loss
of
salary,
there's
no
loss
of
benefits.
the
military
judge
gets
another
assignment,
and--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
going
to
respond
directly
to
that
except
to
say
that
military
officers
and
jag
officers
are
interested
in
having
a
well-rounded
career.
and,
indeed,
the
flexibility
that
the
military
provides
affords
them
the
opportunity
to
gain
experience
in
a
number
of
different
contexts
so
that,
to
the
extent
that
they
become
military
judges,
they
will
bring
that...
that
wisdom
and
that
experience
to
bear.
we're
not
talking
about
first
lieutenants,
by
the
way,
being
military
judges.
we
talking
about,
in
most
instances,
lieutenant
colonels
or
colonels.
these
are
people
with
extensive
experience
within
the
military
system
bringing
that
experience
to
bear
as
military
judges.
one
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
the
protections
under
the
military
judicial
system
is
that
at
the
top
of
the
entire
system
is
the
court
of
military
appeals.
that
is,
as
the
court
is
aware,
a
civilian
court,
and
it's
designed
to
police
the
military
justice
system
against
incursions
on
the
independence
and
impartiality
of
military
judges.
judges
on
the
court
of
military
appeals
serve
for
15
years,
and
the
chief
judge
has
a
5-year
term.
that
court
has
shown
a
willingness,
since
its
creation,
to
address
cases
of
bias
in
the
military
justice
system
in
a
very
effective
way.
there
has
been
some
dispute
in
the
briefs
about
article
6(a)
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
which
is
a
provision
that
allows
for
inquiring
into
the
fitness
of
military
judges
and
whether
it
came
after
the
1983
military
justice
act
legislation
or
at
some
other
time.
but
i
think
it's
important...
and
let
us
concede
that
it
did
come
later
on
than
1983...
that
that
provision
was
a
response
to
what
seemed
to
many
a
very
courageous
decision
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
to
resist
an
effort
by
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
inspector
general
of
the
department
of
defense
to
inquire
into
the
accuracy
and
propriety
of
decisions
that
had
been
made
by
military
judges
in
a
specific
case.
what
the
court
of
military
appeals
said
was
there
cannot
be
that
type
of
investigation.
it
has
to
be
done
pursuant
to
a
commission.
in
sum,
your
honors,
neither
the
appointments
clause
nor
the
due
process
clause
is
violated
by
the
way
in
which
the
military
staffs
and
operates
its
judicial
system.
it
is
a
system
created,
directed,
and
monitored
by
congress
and
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
united
states.
we
think
that
the
decisions
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
very
much.
