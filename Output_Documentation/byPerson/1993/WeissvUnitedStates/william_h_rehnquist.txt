justice

we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
92-1482,
eric
weiss
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
morrison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
distinguishing
between
commissions
as
military
officers
and
commissions
as
article
iii
judicial
officers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so,
then
why
do
you
use
the
term
judicial...
a
commission
as
a
judicial
officer?
is
that
a
word
of
art?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
members
of
the
court,
other
than
the
law
officer,
who
decide
guilt
or
innocence
would
not,
under
your
theory,
have
to
be
appointed
specially
under
the
appointments
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it's
equally
clear
that
congress
did
not
want
a
second
appointment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
they
would
have
provided
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
say
that
this
is
just
what
congress
wanted
but
they
just
didn't
get
around
to
providing
for
a
separate
appointment
really
doesn't
do
justice
to
any
theory
of
enforcing
legislation
that
i
know
of.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
other...
other
than
that
they
certainly
didn't
provide
for
an
appointment
by
the
president.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
know
that?
how
do
you
know
that
they
never
considered
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
not.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
argument
pressed
below?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
difference--
--but
it
was
not...
it
was
not
pressed
below.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
your
due
process
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
morrison.
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
who
could
be
a
convening
authority
besides
an
officer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
you
said
it
didn't
require
the
person
to
be
an
officer.
you
mean
be
a
judicial
officer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
it's
basically
a
decision
whether
you
have
a
court-martial
or
company
punishment
or
captain's
mast,
which
doesn't
require
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
say
with
any
confidence
that
a
conviction
rendered
by
a
defective
court-martial,
if
it
were
determined
that
the
court-martial
were
defective
under
the
appointments
clause,
would
not
be
subject
to
attack
on
habeas
corpus,
even
though
it
had
been...
you
know,
concluded
on
direct
appeal
many
years
ago?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
a
certain
irony,
isn't
there,
in
that
after
all
congress
and
the
military
have
done
to
make
the
system
of
military
justice
more
fair
and
more
equitable,
say,
since
the
time
of
the
second
world
war,
this
is
really
the
first
time
it's
been
challenged?
and
it's
much
more
favorable
to
a
criminal
defendant
now
than
it
certainly
was
40
years
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
mr.
morrison,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
morrison.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
92-1482,
weiss
against
the
united
states.
petitioner
weiss,
a
united
states
marine,
pleaded
guilty
at
a
special
court-martial
to
one
count
of
larceny.
the
court
of
military
appeals
granted
discretionary
review
to
address
his
claim
that
the
military
judges
in
his
case
had
no
authority
to
convict
him,
because
their
appointments
violated
the
appointments
clause
of
the
constitution,
and
because
their
lack
of
a
fixed
term
of
office
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
court
of
military
appeals
rejected
the
due
process
challenge
and
in
a
divided
opinion,
also,
has
rejected
the
appointment
clause
challenge.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
court
of
military
appeals.
we
first
conclude
that
the
current
method
of
appointing
military
judges
does
not
violate
the
appointments
clause.
that
clause
requires
the
president
to
appoint
offices
of
the
united
states,
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
all
of
the
judges
involve
in
petitioner's
cases
were
already
commissioned
military
officers
when
they
were
assigned
to
serve
as
judges,
and
thus
they
have
already
been
appointed
pursuant
to
the
appointments
clause.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress,
as
by
implication,
required
a
second
appointment
under
the
clause
before
qualified
military
officers
can
serve
as
military
judges.
and
we
do
not
think
the
language
of
the
appointments
clause,
by
its
own
force,
requires
a
second
appointment.
turning
next
to
petitioner's
due
process
challenge,
we
recognize
that
the
military
contacts
is
unique,
and
requires
that
we
ask
whether
the
factor
is
militating
in
favor
of
a
fixed
term
of
office
for
military
judges
are
so
weighty,
that
they
overcome
the
balance
strucked
by
congress.
based
on
the
complete
absence
of
10-year
judges
in
the
military,
as
the
historical
matter,
and
the
number
of
safeguards
currently
in
place
to
ensure
that
military
judges
remain
impartial,
we
conclude
that
the
lack
of
fixed
term
of
office
by
military
judges
does
not
violate
the
due
process
clause.
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
souter
have
filed
opinions
concurring;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
is
joined
by
justice
thomas.
