justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
had
thought,
mr.
morrison,
that
when
a
jag
officer
in
the
army
and
the
navy,
as
opposed
to
the
marine
corps,
is
confirmed
and
appointed,
he
is
appointed
as
a
legal
officer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
your
theory
were
to
prevail,
would
those
legal
officers
be
assignable
to
nonlegal
duties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
under
your
theory
you
have
to
be
appointed
to
a
specific
office.
why
isn't
a
legal
officer
a
specific
office
so
that
a
legal
officer
could
not,
say,
take
a
command
position
or
an
officer
position
in
the
combat
unit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
only
a
military
legal
officer
can
advise
with
reference
to
a
will
or
a
divorce?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
under
your
theory,
it
seems
to
me,
that
a
legal
officer
must
be
confined
just
to
legal
duties.
under
your
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
can
do
that.
of
course,
in
the
case
of
the
army
and
the
navy
they
are.
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
the
latter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
the
latter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
it's
a
question
whether
or
not
the
constitution
will
afford
the
dignity
to
the
office
that
the
congress
intended.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
special
statutory
qualifications
for
any
of
those
positions
you've
just
mentioned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
different
than
this
case
where
there
is
a
special
statutory
qualification?
you
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
and
a
certified
legal
officer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
unrealistic
to
say
that
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases
there
is
a
likelihood
that
there
will
be
a
desire
to
please
the
higher
command?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't...
isn't
that
simply
a
recognition
that
there...
that
there
is
a
significant
risk
of
this
kind
of
influence?
