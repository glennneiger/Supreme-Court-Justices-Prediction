mr.
morrison,
you
say
the
only
way
this
could
be
fixed
is
to
have
a
fresh
appointment
in
addition
to
the
appointment
that
the
officer
already
holds.
is
that
so?
or
suppose
congress,
having
set
this
scheme
up
thinking
it
was
an
improvement
over
what
existed
before,
wants
to
run
it
in
the
most
efficient
manner?
is
there
any
cure
for
the
alleged
defect
that
you
are
urging
under
the
appointments
clause,
other
than
to
have
a
fresh
appointment
for
anyone
who
is
going
to
serve
as
a
legal
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
a
judicial
officer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
apart
from
going
back
to
the
way
it
was,
evidently
congress
thought
this
was
an
improvement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
only
way
that
congress
could
make
it
better
is
to
have
this
double
appointment,
is
that
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
think
that
would
be
severable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't...
wouldn't
you...
isn't
it
our
obligation
to
construe
this
law
in
the
way
that
would
save
its
constitutionality
so
that
if
there
is
a
discrete
problem,
that
that
would
be
put
aside
and
not
have
that
tail
of
some
of
these
officers
possibly
being
civilians
wag
the
whole
dog.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
just
one
further
question
on
the
first
appointments
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
not
urging,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
any
separation
of
powers
concern
of
the
type
of
the
legislature
encroaching
on
executive
turf.
this
is
just,
as
you
see
it,
a
technical
violation
of
the
appointments
clause.
is
there
any
larger
purpose?
i
think
you...
you
have
conceded
that
this
was
an
effort
by
congress
to
improve
the
system,
and
it
could
go
back
to
the
old
ways
and
it
wouldn't
have
any
problem.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
thing
that
could
be
done
is
to
have
less
protection
by
going
back
to
the
old
system
where
we
didn't
have
judicial
officers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
general
days,
you
were
going
to
explain
the
role
of
the
convening
authority
who
need
not
be
a
lawyer,
and
perhaps
you
can
enlarge
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
function
kind
of
like
a
grand
jury.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
there
is
an
infirmity
with
respect
to
a
pre-1968
appointment,
for
one
thing
if
it
wasn't
raised
and
the
case
is
closed,
that's...
for
another
it
would
be
a
problem,
if
not
moot,
on
its
way
to
becoming
moot,
given
the
distance
we've
come
since
1968.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
also...
you
made
the
analogy
to
the
elected
judge.
the
elected
judge
is
out
if
he's
not
reelected
or
she's
not
reelected,
but
the
consequence
for
the
judicial
officer
is
not
that,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
know
how
we
tend
to
look
at
it
from
this
angle,
but
i'm
not
so
sure
that
for
a
military
officer
the
highest
and
best
calling
is
that
of
a
judge.
