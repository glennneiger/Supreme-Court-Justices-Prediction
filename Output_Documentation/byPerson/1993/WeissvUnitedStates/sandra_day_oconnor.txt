mr.
morrison--
--and
these
particular
cases
don't
involve
situations
of
use
of
one
of
these
civilian
judges.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
days,
what
about
these
civilian
judges
that
can
be
appointed?
do
you
defend
those
appointments
as
somehow
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that's
fine,
but
i'm
asking
whether
you
can
defend
it
or
whether
you
concede
that
it
fails
to
meet
the
appointments
clause
requirements?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
what
is
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
provision
severable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
you
would
acknowledge,
i'm
sure,
that
there
are
concerns
when
the
judge
is
subject
to
disciplinary
action
by
superiors,
if
the
judge
isn't
tough
enough
or
something
like
that.
and
that's
been
a
concern
that's
been
expressed
from
time
to
time
around
the
country
and
i'm
sure
in
the
halls
of
congress,
and
these
are
serious
concerns
in
the
military
context.
