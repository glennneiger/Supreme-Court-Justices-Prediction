justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
lewin,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
of
fact
there?
you
have
spoken
several
times
of
the
fact
that
they
happen
to
be
religious.
is
it
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
village
district
upon
which
the
school
district
was
superimposed
was...
was
defined
geographically
by
reference
to
the
religious
affiliation
of
the
people
in
it,
so
that
non-satmar
hasidim
were
excluded,
and
those
within
the
village
all
fell
within
the
category
of
the
satmar
sect?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
leaving
that
argument
aside,
i
take
it
that
the
upshot
of
the
creation...
of
the
forces
that
led
to
the
creation
of
the
village
was
that
in
fact
the
village
was
defined
by
adherence
to
this
sect.
whether
the
precipitant
for
that
was
concern
over
zoning,
that
was
the
result,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
lewin,
i
took
you
a
moment
ago
in
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
the
significance
of
aguilar
to
accept
the
proposition
that
in
judging
what
is
a
permissible,
permissive
accommodation,
that
the
range
of
possible
alternatives
for
the
accommodation
should
be
considered.
is
that...
do
you
think
that's
a...
basically
a
fair
premise?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you
there,
but
you
can
reject
the
least
alternative
theory
and
still
accept
the
view
that
alternatives
should
be
considered
in
deciding
just
how
far
the
accommodation
can
legitimately
go.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
might
have
been...
there
might
have
been
an
argument
that
they
were
taking...
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
think
the
argument
is
any
stronger
than
the
argument
that
they're
taking
sides
here,
but
leaving
that
aside,
there
may
have
been
that
argument
but
there
wouldn't
have
been
an
establishment
clause
issue,
would
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
would
have,
but
you
would
have
had
a
much
easier
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
wouldn't
new
york
also
specifically
provide
a...
the
same
authority
to
the
chief
justice's
roman
catholic
group?
of
course
it
would.
if
the
new
york
law
is
otherwise
the
same,
and
you
can
only
charter
school
districts
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
it
would
do
the
same
thing
there
that
it
would
do
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
difference
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
alternative
to
having
a
school
district
in
the
roman
catholic
case,
where
there
is
an
alternative
to
having
this
school
district
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
aren't
you
giving
two
different
answers?
i
mean,
you're
giving
a
purpose
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
and
a
moment
ago
you
gave
a
no
alternative
answer
to
me
when
we
were
discussing
the
problem
posed
by
the
chief's
hypothetical
on
the
roman
catholics.
is
the
problem,
as
you
see
it,
that
there
was
an
express
purpose
to
transfer
power
to
a
religious
group,
or
is
the
problem
here
that
there
were
alternatives
to
doing
that,
to
accomplish
the
same
result,
and
they
didn't
avail
themselves
of
the
alternatives?
which
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the
new
york
law
read
that
school
districts
will
always
be
coterminous
with
religious
districts,
would
you
have
an
objection?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry,
with
municipal
districts.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
have
a
challenge
to
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
there
also
another
difference,
and
that
is
the
monroe-woodbury
school
district
didn't
have
a
plan
to
tuition-out
every
student
from
this
community,
whereas
what
you
have
just
read
to
us
sounds
like
a
plan
to
tuition
out
every
one
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
community.
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
the
distinction
that
i
was
making
wouldn't
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
agreed
with
the
distinction
i
was
making,
but
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
that
answer
wouldn't
be
apposite.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
regardless
of
what
you're
asking
the
court,
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question
was
that
there
was
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
a
plan
to
tuition
out
all
non-hasidic
students,
as
distinct
from
a
plan
to
tuition
out
of
the
main
school
district
all
students
who
were
hasidic,
and
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
the
plan
that
you
referred
to
on
page,
i
think
10
of
the
record,
was
simply
a
plan
to
tuition
out
all
nondisabled
students.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
distinction
i
was
drawing
does
not
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question
going
back
to
something
you
said
a
few
moments
ago,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understood
you.
did
you
indicate
a
few
moments
ago
that
you
thought
the
suggestion
which
i
guess
was
made
by
chief
judge
kaye
that
the
state
could
have
set
up
a
separate
neutral
place
for
the
education
of
these
handicapped
children
alone
would
have
been
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
is
in
fact
three
consolidated
establishment
clause
cases
which
come
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
they
require
us
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
new
york
statute
creating
a
special
school
district
for
the
village
of
kiryas
joel.
kiryas
joel
was
once
part
of
the
town
of
monroe
new
york.
it
was
and
still
is
a
neighborhood
composed
entirely
of
hasidic
jews
who
are
members
of
a
sect
called
the
satmar.
in
1977,
the
satmar
neighborhood
became
separately
incorporated
as
the
village
of
kiryas
joel
in
accordance
with
the
new
york
statute
designed
to
allow
almost
any
neighborhood
within
an
existing
town
to
incorporate
its
own
village.
but
the
village
of
kiryas
joel
remains
part
of
monroe-woodbury
central
school
district
until
the
legislature
pass
the
statute
we
review
today.
that
statute
sets
up
a
school
district
with
all
the
normal
powers
to
collect
local
property
taxes
and
operate
public
schools.
but
unlike
in
normal
school
district,
this
one
incorporates
only
the
village
of
kiryas
joel
and
is
thus,
unusually
small
and
uniquely
homogeneous.
the
range
of
services
the
school
district
offers
is
also
unique
because
almost
all
children
in
kiryas
joel
attend
private
religious
academies.
the
village's
only
public
school
is
one
solely
for
handicap
children
and
it
has
only
40
full
time
students.
the
state
supreme
court
for
albany
county
decided
that
the
statute
creating
the
special
school
district
violated
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
the
appellate
division
and
finally
the
states
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
highest
new
york
court.
the
establishment
clause
compels
the
state
to
pursue
a
course
of
neutrality
towards
religion
favoring
neither
one
religion
over
others
nor
religious
adherence
generally
over
non-adherence.
the
portion
of
my
opinion
that
speaks
for
the
court
explains
that
when
the
state
gave
the
benefits
of
a
special
little
school
district
to
only
one
religious
group,
it
violated
this
command
of
neutrality.
the
statute
applies
just
to
the
satmars
of
kiryas
joel.
it
provides
no
means
by
which
another
religious
group
or
a
non-sectarian
group
might
obtain
the
same
benefit,
nor
does
the
historically
practice
in
the
state
give
any
indication
that
other
applicants
for
small
separate
district
would
be
treated
as
the
satmars
were.
our
history,
in
fact,
suggests
that
they
would
not
be.
while
the
state
of
new
york
may
do
a
number
of
things
to
address
the
educational
problems
of
handicap
children
in
kiryas
joel,
it
may
not
provide
this
kind
of
special
treatment.
a
separate
portion
of
my
opinion
joined
by
justice
blackmun,
justice
stevens,
and
justice
ginsburg
explains
the
state's
further
problem
of
delegating
political
power
to
a
group
defined
according
to
religion.
the
new
york
legislature
purposely
drew
the
school
district
in
a
way
that
made
it
all
satmar
so
that
the
satmar
community
could
effectively
control
public
schools
in
its
neighborhood.
the
establishment
clause
forbids
a
state
to
confer
a
civil
authority
on
a
group
identified
by
law
according
to
its
religion.
the
group
of
local
voters
who
threw
their
elected
representatives
run
public
schools
in
kiryas
joel
were
impermissibly
identified
on
the
basis
of
their
membership
in
the
satmar
sect.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
blackmun
and
ginsburg
join;
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
state
may
not
use
religion
as
a
criterion
to
draw
up
political
or
electoral
lines;
justice
scalia
dissents,
and
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined
his
dissenting
opinion.
