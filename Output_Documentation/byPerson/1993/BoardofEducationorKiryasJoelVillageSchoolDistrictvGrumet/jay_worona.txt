mr.
jay
worona
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
limits
of
the
establishment
clause.
the
respondents
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below
because
the
statute
clearly
violates
that
clause.
as
this
court
has
explained,
a
statute
cannot
be
divorced
from
the
circumstances
existing
at
the
time
it
was
passed.
the
circumstances
leading
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute
before
this
court
today
at
the
village
of
kiryas
joel
demonstrate
that
the
law
was
enacted
in
direct
response
to
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
its
monroe-woodbury
v.
wieder
decision,
where
the
village
of
kiryas
joel
residents
unsuccessfully
sought
to
acquire
a
religiously
segregated
environment
in
which
their
children
could
receive
special
education
services.
mr.
jay
worona
well,
when
i
refer
to
religiously
segregated,
your
honor,
i'm
referring
to
the
fact
that
this
community
is
comprised
exclusively
of
satmar
hasidic
individuals,
and
as
mr.
lewin
indicated,
the
boundary
lines
were
specifically
drawn
to
only
include
those
members.
mr.
jay
worona
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
your
honor,
all
i
can
respond
to
is
that
in
the
monroe-woodbury
v.
wieder
case
before
the
appellate
division,
the
residents
of
the
kiryas
joel
village
maintained
a
free
exercise
claim
for
their
need
to
acquire
a
religiously
segregated
environment
for
the
children
to
be
educated.
mr.
jay
worona
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
of
course,
that's
not
the
issue
before
this
court,
but
as
the
court
of--
mr.
jay
worona
--yes,
your
honor,
because
the
specific
issue
before
you
today
is
not
what
the
residents
of
kiryas
joel
may
be
doing
constitutionally
or
unconstitutionally,
it's
what
the
state
of
new
york
did
when
it
enacted
this
particular
piece
of
legislation.
and
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
from
before,
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
wieder,
the
monroe-woodbury
central
school
districts,
the
court
acknowledged,
undertook
efforts
to
accommodate
the
cultural
bilingual
needs
of
the
satmar
community,
including
the
employment
of
yiddish-speaking
teachers
and
the
provision
of
reports
for
the
satmar
parents
in
yiddish,
so
there
were
accommodations
to
that
specific
cultural
basis
that
were
made.
mr.
jay
worona
well,
that
may
be
true,
your
honor,
but
when
we
look
at
a
statute
to
determine
whether
we
are
responding
to
bilingual,
bicultural
needs
of
a
community,
and
we
see
a
school
district
has
in
fact
responded
to
those
needs,
certainly
we
cannot
ignore
that
particular
fact.
mr.
jay
worona
well--
mr.
jay
worona
--however,
your
honor,
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
monroe-woodbury
v.
wieder,
we
saw
that
the
village
residents
were
willing
to
forego
bilingual
services
as
long
as
they
acquired
a
segregated
environment
for
their
children
to
be
educated--
mr.
jay
worona
--and
i
think
that's
a
very
big
distinction
with
a
difference.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
worona
yes.
mr.
jay
worona
well,
we
are
not
conceding
that
the
village
was
necessarily
incorporated
in
a
constitutionally
permissible
manner.
certainly,
that's
not
directly
before
this
court.
i
agree
with
your
honor's
question
before,
which
was
addressed
to
mr.
lewin
with
respect
to
the
village
law
in
new
york
state,
which
does
not
allow
individuals
to
contest
the
formation
of
villages
in
the
same
grandiose
manner
that
other
particular
municipalities
may
be
contested.
mr.
jay
worona
that's
right.
mr.
jay
worona
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
reality
that
we
cannot
ignore
is
that
those
boundary
lines
were
specifically
drawn
to
only
include
members
of
the
satmar
hasidic
community.
in
the
petition
which
is
before
you
on
joint
appendix
page
10,
in
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
supervisor
of
the
town
of
monroe
in
signing
this
petition
indicated
that
the
residents
are
and
will
be
all
of
the
satmar
hasidic
persuasion.
he
indicated
that
the
sociological
way
of
life
for
the
satmar
hasidim
is
one
of
disdained
isolation
from
the
rest
of
the
community.
mr.
jay
worona
if
that
facility,
your
honor,
was
based
upon
secular
concerns
and
not
solely
religious
concerns,
i
suppose
that
facility
would
be
constitutional
permissible.
mr.
jay
worona
your
honor,
if
i
may
respond
in
two
parts,
firstly,
the
establishment
of
that
type
of
a
school
for
these
individuals
would
certainly
not
have
an
element
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
case,
which
is
that
we
would
not
be
imbuing
a
religious
community
with
governmental
powers
and
functions,
and
we
certainly
would
not
be--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
i
think
we
do
have
a
clear
case.
i
agree
with
the
point
that
you're
making.
i
think
that
in
order
to
analogize
this
particular
community
to
that
of
a
church,
we
do
need
to
look
at
the
entire
context
in
which
this
particular
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
lewin
even
in
his
reply
brief
has
acknowledged
that
this
particular
section...
or
this
particular
statute
is
in
fact
placing
the
satmars
in
a
position
where
they
would
have
been
without
the
statute--
mr.
jay
worona
--no,
that's
not
what
we're
saying.
mr.
jay
worona
no.
we're
asking
this
court
to
examine
the
context
in
which
this
particular
piece
of
legislation
was
established.
if
a
group
of
folks
happen
to
reside
in
an
area,
and
it
was
mere
happenstance
that
they
simply
were
able--
mr.
jay
worona
--it
might
be.
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
be
unconstitutional,
if
indeed
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
passage
of
that
legislation
are
not
as
they
are
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
worona
well--
mr.
jay
worona
--i
think
the
major
problem
that
we
have
in
this
particular
case
is
that--
mr.
jay
worona
--i
will
try,
your
honor,
and
forgive
me--
mr.
jay
worona
--yes.
[laughter]
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
be
unconstitutional
for
a
group
of
individuals
who
happen
to
be
of
one
particular
religious
persuasion
to
be
granted
the
authority
of
having
a
school
district
within
their
community.
it's
very
different
in
this
case,
because
we
have
a
situation
where
new
york
state
specifically
decided
to
provide
this
community
with
the
ability
to
run
a
segregated
school
district,
and
that
is--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
that's
precisely
the
point
that
the
respondents
are
making,
and
we
believe--
mr.
jay
worona
--that's
correct,
because
this
school
district,
your
honor,
was
one
of
a...
was
part
of
an
existing
school
district
at
the
time,
which
i
think
is
a
very
big
distinction,
and
indeed,
the
establishment
of
this
school
district
i
think
would
violate
some
fundamental
principles
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
jay
worona
if
they
wanted
to
break
away
for
the
reason
of
acquiring
governmental
powers
and
functions
to
live
an
insular
life
style
in
conformity
with
their
religious
precepts,
i
suppose
that
would
be
unconstitutional
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
worona
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
first
amendment
in
that
i
don't
think
this
particular
culture
can
be
divorced
from
its
religious
traditions
and
practices.
mr.
jay
worona
as
i
understand
the
formation
of
utah,
certainly
the
united
states
government
required
the
mormons,
who
were
predominantly
occupying
the
state
prior
to
it
becoming
a
state,
they
were
required
to
put
special
provisions
in
their
constitution
to
protect
the
united
states
from
acquiring
a
state
that
would
be
arguably
theocratic,
and
the
difference,
i
think,
is
that
if
somebody
happens
to
move
into
a
place
where
there
isn't...
there
is
not
already
an
existing
school
district
that
is
serving
them,
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
a
secular
need.
they
need
to
be
served.
they
need
to
acquire
a
school
district.
here,
the
kiryas
joel
village
residents
were
already
part
of
the
monroe-woodbury
central
school
district.
mr.
jay
worona
i
don't
know
if--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
your
honor--
[laughter]
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
every
single...
every
single
parcel
of
land
in
new
york
state
is
presently
occupied
by
the
boundaries
of
a
school
district,
so
i
don't
think
that
frontier
type
of
a
scenario
would
necessarily
exist.
mr.
jay
worona
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
could
you
repeat
that
question?
mr.
jay
worona
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
we
believe
that
a
political
constituency
defined
along
religious
lines
has
in
fact
been
established
by
the
statute,
your
honor.
the
particular
community
of
individuals
who
are
devoutly
religious
were
imbued
with
governmental
powers
and
functions
to
allow
them
not
simply
to
be
exempted,
as
this
court
has
in
the
past
accepted,
to
privately
pursue
their
religious
perspectives,
but
rather,
new
york
state
has
offered
its
arm
to
these
individuals
to
be
able
to
run
a
school
district
with
full
governmental--
mr.
jay
worona
--for
what
purpose
what,
your
honor?
mr.
jay
worona
to
allow
them--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
i
think
the
purpose
certainly
here
is
one
of
segregation
along
religious
lines.
it
was
the
pursuit
of
that
particular
principle
that
was
primarily
sought
after,
and
indeed
was
advanced
by
this
legislation.
mr.
jay
worona
well,
we're
not
suggesting
it's
necessarily
the
latter.
i
think
having
the
latter
present
will
perhaps
provide
a
greater
effect
of
unconstitutionality
of
this
particular
piece
of
legislation,
but
we
are
maintaining
certainly
that
the
legislature
designed
this
particular
piece
of
legislation
to
allow
this
particular
religious
community
to
dictate
what
educational
services
would
be
provided
in
conformity
with
their
traditions
and
beliefs.
mr.
jay
worona
no,
i
don't
believe
they
would
all
be
invalid,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
case
can
only
be
analyzed
in
looking
at
the
entire
context
in
which
this
particular
legislation
was
effectuated.
if,
indeed,
we
have
a
community,
as
i
answered
the
chief
justice
before,
that
happens
to
be
of
a
particular
religious
persuasion,
which
happens
to
have
a
school
district,
that
doesn't
necessarily
make
it
constitutionally
infirm.
the
constitutional
infirmity
here
is
by
setting
up
political
constituencies
defined
along
religious
lines--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
i
presume
in
your
hypothetical
there
would
not
be
religious
beliefs
that
were
present.
mr.
jay
worona
okay.
i
think
that
we
would
not
be
dealing--
mr.
jay
worona
--with
an
establishment
clause--
mr.
jay
worona
--i
suppose
there
would
be
an
establishment
clause
problem.
mr.
jay
worona
our
position
is
not
based
upon
anything
but
the
fact
that
there
is
an
establishment
clause
at
this
point.
mr.
jay
worona
no,
that
is
not
our
position,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
accommodation
is
certainly
acceptable.
this
accommodation,
however,
will
in
fact
place
the
balance
off
the
kilter
of
the
scale.
mr.
jay
worona
if,
in
fact...
yes,
your
honor,
if
in
fact
that
accommodation
was
in
conformity
with
this
court's
pronouncement
in
wolman
v.
walter,
which
dealt
with
the
provision
of
neutral
sites
to
children
who
were
attending
parochial
schools.
mr.
jay
worona
well,
it
really
isn't,
your
honor.
i
think
the
essence
of
our
argument,
if
we
were
looking
at
lemon
v.
kurtzman
and
its
three
prongs,
would
be
the
second
prong,
because
chapter
748
of
the
laws
of
1989
communicates
a
message
of
endorsement
to
the
public,
and
they
may
fairly
understand
that
the
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
accommodate
satmar
separatist
beliefs,
and
the
public
perception
of
endorsement
is
reinforced
by
this
statute
in
that
it's
not
a
statute
of
general
applicability,
as
many
justices
have
already
noted.
mr.
jay
worona
with
religious
districts,
your
honor?
mr.
jay
worona
no.
i
think
that
would
be
a
secular
particular
law,
and
if
in
application
there
was
a
problem,
certainly
there
could
be
a
challenge
at
that
particular
time.
here,
we're
dealing,
as
i
started
to
indicate--
mr.
jay
worona
--would
i
have
a
challenge?
not
based
upon
this
particular
facial
challenge,
your
honor.
the
respondents
in
this
action
believe
that
this
particular
action
of
the
new
york
state
legislature,
if
precedentially
allowed
to
exist
in
this
nation,
will
not
only
politically
fragment
our
nation,
but
will
place
children
in
a
position
of
understanding
that
the
way
we
deal
with
diversity
and
respect
for
ourselves
religiously
is
to
have
government
separate
people
along
religious
lines,
and
that
is
something
that
we
don't
think
is
palatable
for
the
country
or
consistent
with--
mr.
jay
worona
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
our
understanding,
and
it's
in
the
record,
all
of
those
children
are
also
members
of
the
satmar
community.
mr.
jay
worona
i
do
not
know.
in
the
petitioner's
papers,
they
indicate
that
they
are
maintaining
a
secular
program,
but
since
that
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court,
i
do
not
have
any
personal
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
jay
worona
that...
that--
mr.
jay
worona
--not
that
i
am
aware
of,
particularly,
but
of
course,
that's
not
the
issue
before
us.
the
issue
is
not
what,
again,
kiryas
joel
may
be
doing
in
maintaining
their
program,
but
rather
what
new
york
state
did
when
it
established
this
particular
school
district.
i
want
to
make
one
other
point
that
i
think
is
very
relevant,
because
i
think
we
all
are
here
today
to
talk
about
the
children,
and
i
think
one
of
the
things
we
cannot
ignore
is
the
fact
that
this
particular
statute
in
essence
precludes
these
children
from
acquiring
the
protections
of
both
federal
and
state
laws
that
serve
disabled
children.
those
laws
are
predicated
on
the
premise
that
those
children
must
be
mainstreamed
as
much
as
possible,
and
as
much
as
feasible.
these
children
are
in--
mr.
jay
worona
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
worona
well--
mr.
jay
worona
--because
we're
not
imbuing
any
particular
governmental
functions
on
any
particular
religious
person
to
carry
out
those...
his
religion.
we
are
rather
allowing
people
to
privately
pursue
their
religion.
mr.
jay
worona
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
worona
well,
we
are
not,
again,
your
honor,
maintaining
that
our
argument
is
predicated
upon
a
belief
that
the
satmar
religious
leaders
will
necessarily
be
incapable
of
exercising
governmental
powers
and
functions.
we
maintain
that
that
is
true,
but
that's
not
the
basis
upon
which
our
argument
lies.
rather,
we
are
indicating
that
we
are
taking--
mr.
jay
worona
--no,
your
honor,
but
in
this
particular
record,
when
the
school
board
was
first
established,
a
gentleman
tried
to
run
for
the
school
board
against
the
directives
of
the
grand
rebbeh,
and
as
i
under--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
think
the
record
is
very
clear
about
the
points
that
you
are
maintaining.
for
example,
prior
to
the
establishment
of
this
school
district,
the
monroe-woodbury
central
school
district
urged
the
governor
to
sign
this
legislation,
and
they
indicated
that
if
a
non-hasidic
child
requiring
regular
education
moved
into
the
kiryas
joel
school
district's
geographic
boundaries,
and
then...
this
is
on
page
2
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
this
is
virtually
impossible.
the
child
would
be
tuitioned
to
monroe-woodbury
or
another
district.
the
legislators
who
passed
this
action
also
were
well
aware--
mr.
jay
worona
--because
if
we
look
at
what
was
provided...
and
your
honor
is
quite
correct,
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
here
where
looking
at
disabilities
laws
is
a
federal
statute
and
would
not
necessarily
be
a
constitutional
impermissibility.
however,
if
these
children
are
incapable
of
acquiring
their
rights
under
federal
and
state
law,
and
we
understand
why,
and
that
is
because
their
parents
wished
to
maintain
a
lifestyle,
then--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
again,
i
think
the
principal
point
of
where
we
maintain
our
argument,
which
a
crucial
distinction
is
that
there
is
not
an
imbuing
of
governmental
powers
and
functions
upon
an
individual
in
that
situation.
there
is
simply--
mr.
jay
worona
--that
is
provided.
mr.
jay
worona
right.
i
think
that
is
a
crucial
distinction,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
certainly
under
new
york
state
law,
monroe-woodbury
could
have
provided
the
benefits
that
are
being
sought
here.
indeed,
when
they
began
this
litigation
in
monroe-woodbury
v.
wieder,
the
case
that
was
looking
for
a
neutral
site,
they
maintained
that
they
could
not
serve
these
children
any
other
place
but
the
public
schools.
the
court
of
appeals,
new
york
state's
highest
court,
ruled
that
that
was
not
necessarily
true.
they
also
maintained
that
there
was
some
constitutional
infirmities
with
segregating
these
children
along
religious
lines,
and
now
they
stand
before
you
today
and
indicate
that
it
is
not
necessarily
unconstitutional
to
do
the
same
thing
by
having
new
york
state
segregate
children
along
religious
lines.
mr.
jay
worona
well,
your
honor,
they
can
by
this
statute
have
a
regular
school.
the...
everyone
envisioned
that
this
school--
mr.
jay
worona
--not
necessarily,
but
of
course
we
maintain
that
everyone
understood
quite
well
that
that
would
not
happen.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
worona
well--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
look
at--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
could
you
repeat
the
question,
your
honor?
mr.
jay
worona
well...
yes.
mr.
jay
worona
that
is
correct.
however,
i
think
the--
mr.
jay
worona
--well,
we
believe
it
does,
because
even
though
those
are
the
words
in
this
particular
paragraph,
i
think
the
context
of
those
words,
when
it
says
virtually
impossible,
is
referring
to
the
fact
that
no
other
non-satmar
individual
would
be
residing
in
that
community.
i
don't
think
that's
really
in
dispute
here.
mr.
lewin
has
admitted
that
most
of
the
residents,
or
all
of
the
residents,
are
members
of
the
satmar
community.
i
think
the
essential
question
that
needs
to
be
asked,
and
if,
indeed,
the
kiryas
joel
village
school
district
was
indeed
capable
of
becoming
as
heterogenous
as
the
monroe-woodbury
central
school
district,
what
benefit
would
have
actually
been
afforded
to
these
individuals?
the
statute
would
have
had
absolutely
no
purpose.
so
i
think
we
can
all
move
on
from
that
particular
issue
and
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
it's
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause,
not
whether
it
was
indeed
capable
of
being
as
heterogenous
as
the
school
district
that
it
was
seceding
from.
mr.
jay
worona
it
could
have
been
unconstitutional.
i
don't
believe
it
necessarily
would
have
been
unconstitutional.
what
we
were
indicating
is
that
it
would
still
have
to
be
in
conformity
with
this
court's
pronouncements
in
wolman
v.
walter.
