mr.
lewin,
may
i
inquire,
this
is
a
special
act
of
the
legislature
just
directed
to
form
this
one
school
district?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
not
such
that
other
people
similarly
situated
could
form
their
own
special
school
district?
why
did
a
special
law
have
to
be
enacted
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
every
school
district
in
the
state
of
new
york
formed
by
a
special
act
of
the
legislature?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
rather
than
by
a
general
provision
that
allows
residents
of
areas
to
form
their
own
district.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
always
done
that
way--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--not
by
some
general
law--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
would
allow
similar
groups
to
form
districts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
lewin,
if...
if
such
a
law
were
to
neutrally
extend
to
everybody
in
new
york,
so
that
anybody
similarly
situated
could
dispose
of
their
own
trash,
i
think
you
have
a
very
good
argument.
i
have
a
little
trouble
seeing
why
the
same
analysis
applies
when
the
law
that
you're
examining
is
not
neutral.
it's
just
limited
to
this
one
situation.
it
isn't
a
broadly
based
law
that
says
people
living
in
a
village
can
have
their
own
school
district,
whoever
they
are,
whether
they're
this
group
or
some
other
group,
and
yet
it
seems
that
new
york
has
chosen
to
do
this
quite
separately,
so
i
hope
you
will
address
that
aspect.
one
other
question,
preliminarily.
i
guess
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
but
for
this
court's
decision
in
aguilar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
aguilar--
--and
had
we
held--
--excuse
me.
--otherwise,
then
the
services
would
be
provided
with
the
federal
aid
on
the
premises
of
the
religious
schools.
and
if
that
were
happening,
would
the
mechanism
of
the
accommodation
that
is
in
question
here
have
been
permissible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
sabbatarian
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
was
struck
down,
wasn't
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--because
it
didn't
apply
neutrally
to
people
with
other
needs
for
a
day
off.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
the
state's
accommodation
needs
to
be
neutrally
applied,
if
possible,
so
that
all
people
similarly
situated
have
the
same
option,
or
can
the
state
single
out
one
sect
or
one
religious
group
and
provide
some
benefit
there,
but
not
make
it
generally
applicable?
is
there
a
difference,
in
a
neutrally
applied
scheme
open
to
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
is
this
neutral,
if
the
legislature
set
up
just
a
special
school
district
for
this
one
situation,
instead
of
passing
a
law
to
the
effect
that
groups
of
people
or
villages
or
towns
can
form
their
own
school
district
by
applying
neutral
criteria?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
it
a
dangerous
precedent
to
let
the
legislature
tackle
a
so-called
accommodation
by
singling
something
out
like
this,
as
opposed
to
passing
a
neutrally
applicable
law?
