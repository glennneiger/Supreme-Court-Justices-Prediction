we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-517,
the
board
of
education
of
kiryas
joel
village
school
district
v.
louis

and
two
cases
consolidated
with
it
for
argument.

thank
you.
is
this
place
geographically
located
up
around
rochester?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
not
monroe
county,
then.
it's
on
the
hudson.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mereson.
mr.
worona.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
satmars,
because
they
all
live
together,
can't
exercise
the
ordinary
kind
of
secular
authority
that
any
other
group
living
together
could.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
a
large
group
of
roman
catholics
lived
close
together
in
some
part
of
new
york
state,
and
they
decide
they
would
like
a
separate
school
district,
and
they
go
through
the
normal
forms
of
it,
an
the
state
legislature
creates
a
special
act
school
district,
is
that
suspect
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
they
said,
we'd
like
to
have
our
own
school
district.
we
think
pretty
much
alike
on
school
issues,
and
we
just
want
our
own
school
district--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
they're
all...
99.9
percent
of
them
are
roman
catholic.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
will
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you--
--supposing
that
my
roman
catholic
hypothesis,
they
want
to
break
away
from
the
school
district
they're
in,
just
like
the
people
did
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
a
necessary
element
of
your
answer
that
they
want
to
live
an
insular
lifestyle?
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
latter
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
worona.
mr.
lewin,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted--

opinion
of
the
court
in
no.

versus
grumet
and
