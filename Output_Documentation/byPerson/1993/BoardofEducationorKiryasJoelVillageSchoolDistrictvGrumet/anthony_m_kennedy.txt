justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
fair
to
say
that
governmental
power
was
transferred
here
to
a
geographic
entity
based
on
the
religious
beliefs
and
practices
of
its
residents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
my
characterization
that
i
used
in
the
question
were
deemed
the
appropriate
characterization,
would
you
lose
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no,
my
question,
following
justice
o'connor's,
was,
had
aguilar
v.
felton
come
out
the
other
way--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
these
services
had
been
provided
in
the
private
schools
themselves,
would
you
then
nevertheless
have
had
the
constitutional
option
to
have
the
district
formed
as
it
was
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
say
that
the
solution
to
the
accommodation
that
you
adopted
was
the
transfer
of
power,
governmental
power,
based
on
the
religious
beliefs
and
practices
of
the
recipients.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
that
a
question
of
fact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
i
had
thought
that
it
was
the
whole
basis
of
both
sides
in
this
case
that
the
conceded
fact
that
the
rationale
for
the
drawing
of
the
geographic
lines
of
this
district
was
the
religious
beliefs
and
practices
of
its
residents,
pure
and
simple.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
contention
that
one
of
the
principal,
or
maybe
the
only
purpose
of
forming
the
new
district
was
to
transfer
powers
to
people
by
reason
of
their
religious
beliefs,
or
is
that
not
your
contention?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
contention
that
one
of
the
principal
purposes
of
this
statute
was
to
transfer
governmental
power
to
a
group
of
persons
by
reason
of
their
religious
practices
and
beliefs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
what
reason?
why
a
town
but
not
a
school
district?
may
i
just
finish?
for
what
purpose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
what
purpose
was
the
power
given
to
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me,
otherwise
you
cannot
distinguish
your
case
from
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical.
