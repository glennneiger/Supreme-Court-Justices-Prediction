justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
maybe
unconstitutional
too,
mr.
lewin,
i
guess.
if
people
for
religious
reasons
have
larger
families
we
can't
have
special
communities
with
special
zoning
rules
for
them,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
argument
being
made
is
that
if
they
had
large
families
for
some
other
reason,
not
a
religious
reason,
you
could...
you
could
establish
a
special
community
with
different
zoning
laws
for
that
group,
but
if
they
have
large
families
for
religious
reasons,
just
as
this
community
has
certain
customs
that
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
go
to
another
community
for
their
schooling
for
religious
reasons,
then
it's
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you'd
say
that
would
be
okay,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
see
a
difference
between
the
two?
i
mean,
is
that
a
usable
test?
by
tolerating
it
and
facilitating
it,
you
advance
it.
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
pretend
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mereson,
doesn't
the
legislature
always
single
out
a
school
district?
doesn't
it
create...
i
thought
from
mr.
lewin's
description
that
it
always
creates
school
districts
single
case
by
single
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
basis
of
any
general
criteria,
or
on
the
basis
of
whether
a
particular
group
seems
to
be
a
community?
i
assume
that's
how
they
do
it,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mereson,
does
the
need
carry
the
state
as
far
as
the
state
went,
because
even
assuming
that
it's
appropriate
for
the
state
to
deal
with
these
problems
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
the
state
could
have
done
so
here,
i
presume,
by
a
statute
simply
mandating
that
some
kind
of
a
special
school
in
a
neutral
place
be
set
up
by
the
existing
school
district
to
accommodate
these
particular
children,
and
by
doing
that
it
would
not
have
involved
the...
in
effect
the
identification
of
the
governance
of
the
school
district
with
a
particular
religious
sect.
the
state
could
have
done
the
former,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
you
say
religiously
segregated.
that
sort
of
begs
the
question,
doesn't
it?
it
was
culturally
segregated,
certainly,
you
might
say
linguistically
segregated,
but
why
necessarily
religiously
segregated?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but...
well,
you
could
say
it
was
drawn
to
include
those
members,
or
you
could
say
it
was
drawn
to
include
people
who
speak
yiddish.
their
customs
spring
out
of
their
religion,
but
the
state
was
accommodating
primarily
their
customs,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
accommodating
any
of
their
religious
practices,
their
religious
ceremonies,
anything
of
that
sort?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
they
were
saying
is,
if
you
do
not
make
accommodation
for
a
culture
which
springs
out
of
the
religion,
you
are
discriminating
against
the
religion,
but
that
isn't
the
same
thing
as
saying
cultural
accommodation
is
necessarily
accommodating
their
religious
beliefs.
i
don't
see
how
the
state
is
accommodating
any
of
their
religious
beliefs.
it
doesn't
allow
any
worship
in
this
school
district,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
parents
didn't
think
it
was
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
the
record
shows
that
it
is
responding
to
the
religious
needs.
in
what
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
understand
that.
it
seems
to
me
they're
responding
to
purely
cultural
needs,
special
language,
special
isolation
from
modernity
such
as
television,
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
problem.
they
did
it
too
late.
if
they'd
only
gone
out
in
the
wilderness
where
there
was
another--
[laughter]
where
there
was
not
another
school
district
near
them
to
start
off
with,
they
would
have
been
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
they
have
to
do
is
move
further
out
into
new
york
state
and
they
can
start
their
own...
they'll
do
it
if
you
say
that's
okay,
i'm
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
defined
along
cultural...
let
me
give
you
a
two-part
hypothetical.
suppose
you
have
a
community
divided
by
railroad
tracks.
one
side
of
the
community
is
a
very
swinging,
modern-type
crowd,
and
they
like
avant-garde
education,
sex
education
and
all
that.
the
other
side
of
the
tracks,
influenced
by
a
reaction
to
modernity,
feminist
aversion
to
obscenity
and
so
forth,
they
want
old-fashioned
education.
they
can
have
two
school
districts
if
the
state
sees
these
people
want
different
things
in
education?
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now,
my
second
hypothetical
is--
[laughter]
--they
have
the
same
beliefs,
the
same...
some
like
sex
ed,
some
don't.
however,
the
reason
for
it
is
not
feminism,
or
avant-gardism,
the
same
cultural
preferences
spring
from
their
religious
beliefs.
then
you
couldn't
do
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot
accommodate
any...
any
beliefs
that
spring
from
religious
motivation?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
eminently
reasonable.
he
would
have
a
cultural
problem
in
the
kiryas
joel
district,
just
as
the
kiryas
joel
children
have
cultural
problems
in
the
other
district.
why
do
you
find
that
so
extraordinary?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
like
a
parent
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
who
wants
her
child
to
have
sex
education
and
seeks
permission
from
the
school
district
on
the
one
side
of
the
tracks
to
send
the
child
to
the
school
district
on
the
other
side.
what's
so
wrong
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there--
