justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lewin,
am
i
right
that
there's
no
dispute
in
this
record
that
compliance
with
the
new
york
law
in
establishing
villages
isn't
at
issue.
it's
rather
easy
to
form
a
village,
and
although
this
opinion
that
you
cited
allows
the
village
rather
grudgingly
makes
the
point
that
whatever
this
group
was,
that
they
met
all
the
requirements
of
new
york
state
law
to
form
a
separate
village,
so
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
case
i
think
would
be
considerably
harder
if
you
didn't
have
the
school
district
that
coincided
with
the
preexisting
village
boundaries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
not
be
all
right
if,
say,
a
religious
body...
say,
the
board
of
the
synagogue...
had
been
appointed
the
board
members
of
the
school
board.
that
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lewin,
i
have
one
question
about
one
of
your
copetitioners.
there
was
a
reference
by
the
monroe-woodbury
school
board
in
their
brief
that
compared
the
alleged
restraint
on
sale
and
rental
of
property
to
people
outside
the
satmar
community
to
a
church
tithe
that
the
individual
is
free
to
pay
or
not
to
pay,
and
i
found
that
disturbing,
because
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
choice.
the
state
law
and
the
federal
law
requires
that
sale
and
rental
be
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis.
the
satmar
does
not
have
a
choice
to
refuse
to
sell
to
an
outsider.
is
that
your
understanding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
that
judge
kaye's
position
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
though?
isn't...
didn't
she
say
you
could
have
the
same
facility,
only
it
would
be
under
the
aegis
of
the
monroe-woodbury
school
board
and
not
the
kiryas
joel
village
school
board,
and
that
would
be
all
right?
wasn't
that
essentially
her
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be
a
different
challenge.
there's
a
facial
challenge
here.
you're
saying,
even
if
they
follow
all
the
rules
of
the
state
of
new
york
for
secular
education.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
we
start
with
the
village,
the
creation
of
the
village?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
came
up
in
mr.
lewin's
argument.
are
you
acknowledging
that
the
creation
of
that
village
was
consistent
with
the
establishment
clause?
there
was
no
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
for
the...
whatever
it
was,
the
zoning
authority
to
issue
this
decision
giving
approval...
the
supervisor
of
the
town
of
monroe
giving
approval
under
the
new
york
laws
on
the
creation
of
the
village,
to
the
creation
of
the
village
of
kiryas
joel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
a
contest
at
least
to
the
extent
that
the
original
boundaries
proposed
were
much
broader
than
just
the
satmar
community,
and
there
was
opposition
to
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
they
were
cut
back
to
the...
but
the
original
proposal
was
for
a
larger
village
that
would
incorporate
more
than
just
this
one
community.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
it
that
we
have
the
village
as
it
is.
would
there
be
any
constitutional
problem
if
the
same
facility
existed
but
it
was
operated
by
the
monroe-woodbury
school
board
instead
of
the
elected
people
from
this
particular
community?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
make
it
the
same
facility
that
now
exists,
except
that
instead
of
having
a
kiryas
joel
county
or
village
school
board
you
have
the
same
monroe-woodbury
school
board
that
is
administering
all
the
other
schools
in
the
monroe-woodbury
area.
everything's
the
same,
except
the
board
that
runs
it
is
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
you
see
a
difference...
you
keep
saying,
religious
community.
the
cases
that
are
closest
to
this
one,
the
precedents
that
are
closest,
as
you
know,
involve
a
religious
body
being
given
the
authority,
a
church
body,
where
here
it's
citizens
of
a
village
who
belong
to
a
particular
religious
community
but
are
not
themselves
church,
synagogue
officials.
isn't
there
a
distinction...
you
keep
talking
about
a
religious
community.
if
the
power
were
given
to
the
board
of
a
religious
community,
then
you
would
have
a
clear
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
you
distinguish
this
from,
say,
just
a
community
in
utah,
where
the
people
in
a
village
are
all
coreligionist?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
why
that
isn't
present
in
a
good
many
communities,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
in
the
state
of
utah,
where
members
of
the
church
of
latter
day
saints
live
in
certain
communities
and
want
to
have
their
own
school
districts,
and
they
do,
so
under
your
view,
all
those
would
be
invalid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
judge
kaye's
accommodation
okay?
that
is,
she
said
in
her
most
recent
opinion
that
if
you...
as
i
understand
it,
you
had
this
neutral
facility,
same
facility,
but
it
was
run
by
the
monroe
county
school
board.
that
accommodation
would
be
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
the
if
out
of
it.
just...
everything
that
we
have
here,
except
that
it's
the
monroe
county
school
board,
not
a
separate
school
board,
that's
running
it.
if
that's
okay,
then
i
think
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
we
have
to
look
to
the
purpose...
one
of
the
hardest
problems
as
i
see
it
is
that
these
people
are
citizens
of
a
community,
and
they're
elected
the
way
representative
elections
are
conducted,
but
they're
also
members
of
a
tightly
knit
religious
community,
and
your
argument
seems
to
hang
on
equating
them,
saying
that
they
can't
take
off
their
religious
hats
when
they're
elected
to
be
members
of
the
school
board.
i
think
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can
have
a
minister
be
a
member
of
a
legislative
body.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
that's...
and
so,
why
can't
you
have
a
school
board
composed
of
people
of
a
certain
religion
who
are
not
the
political...
who
are
not
acting
in
their
capacity
as
a
governing
body
of
a
church?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
maintain
that
is
true
as
opposed
to,
say,
a
catholic
priest
serving
as
a
legislator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
you
have
some
kind
of
an
as-applied
challenge.
there's
been
a
lot
of
things
outside
the
record
that
have
been
suggested,
that
the
claim
that
this
school
is
run
in
a
secular
way
and
that
the
school
board
is
acting
as
any
secular
school
board
would
operate,
that
that's
not
true.
that
would
be
a
different
case,
not
the
one
that's
here.
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
worona,
on
the
tuitioning
out,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
people
who
tuitioned
out
are
the
regular
students
for
whom
there
are
no
facilities,
but
if
they
were
someone...
a
disabled
child
who
was
from...
who
was
not
of
the
satmar
community,
that
person
wouldn't
be
tuitioned
out,
would
that
person?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'd
appreciate
an
answer
to
that
question.
suppose
there
is
a
child
in
the
school
district
who
is
not
of
the
same
religion,
and
who
is
disabled,
that
child
would
not
be
tuitioned
out,
would
that
child,
under
the--
