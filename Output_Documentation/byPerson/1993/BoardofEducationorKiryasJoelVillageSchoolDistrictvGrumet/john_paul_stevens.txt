justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other
factual
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
children
separated
by
sex,
or
are
they
all...
boys
and
girls
take
training
together?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
puzzles
me,
because
is
that
consistent
with
the
religious
doctrine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
also
true
during
the
pre-aguilar
special
education
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
that
a
little
more?
you
started
to
answer
a
question
earlier,
what
the
need
was
that
the
state
was
accommodating.
would
you
state
again
exactly
what
the
need
for
this
legislation
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
were
being
provided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
were
available.
let
me
say,
which
were
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
what
respect
were
the
services
inappropriate?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
critical
fact
is,
they
didn't
want
these
children
exposed
to
these
out-of-district
influences
that
they
would
be
exposed
to
out
of
the
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
test
that
if
i
may.
is
it
not
true
that
this
district
accepts
students
from
outside
the
particular
neighborhood?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
what
language
the
teaching
is
conducted
in
in
this
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
new
york
law
that
requires
that
school
districts
do
their
teaching
in
the
english
language?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
english
language
be
taught
in
schools
in
new
york?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
statutory
violation.
i
mean,
you
can
bring
another
suit
for
that,
i
suppose.
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr....
let
me
ask
you
this
question
about
our
federal
congress.
i'm
reading
from
the
congressional
record
in
which
the
senate
majority
leader,
mr.
mitchell,
is
describing
the
legislative
schedule
for
the
102nd
congress
in
1991.
he
lists
the
nonlegislative
periods.
he
lists
presidents'
day,
lincoln's
birthday.
march
29th,
good
friday.
march
30th,
passover.
march
31,
easter.
september
9,
rosh
hashanah.
is
all
that
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
just
accommodating
the
religious
practices
of
people
for
congress
to
go
out
of
session
in
order
to
accommodate
people
who
want
to
observe
good
friday
or
rosh
hashanah.
why
isn't
that
unconstitutional?
