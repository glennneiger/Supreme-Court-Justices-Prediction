ms.
julie
s.
mereson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
do
i
need
to
lower
the
microphone?
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
okay.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
state's
action
was
one
that
tolerated
religious
and
lifestyle
differences,
or
whether
it
advanced,
promoted,
or
furthered
the
satmar
sect
itself.
the
former
is
commanded
by
the
constitution,
but
the
latter
is
prohibited.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
i
believe
there's
a
great
difference
between
the
two.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
in
fact,
there's
a
red
line
between
the
two
that
sometimes
is
hard
to
discern,
perhaps,
but
on
the
one
hand
you
have
an
ability
to
tolerate
and
to
acknowledge
something
that
preexists
the
legislation
or
state
act,
and
then
on
the
other
side,
you
have
things
that
actually
encourage
religious
practice
or
make
it
particularly
advantageous
to
practice
a
religion...
for
instance,
the
prayer
in
the
schools.
tolerance
is
a
recognition
of
differences
and
an
alleviation
of
a
burden.
on
the
other
side
of
the
establishment
clause,
the
free
exercise
right,
the
tolerance
is
an
accommodation.
it's
a
means
of
making
somebody's
religious
life
not
disadvantageous.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
the
neutrality
here
is
not
in
the
sense
of
applying
to
all.
there
is
neutrality
here,
and
yes,
the
state
needs
to
be
neutral,
but
the
neutrality
exists
in
the
context
of
the
particular
problem.
when
you're
dealing--
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
--because
here
the
legislature
was
reacting
to
a
particular
local
problem.
there
was
a
local
problem
that
did
not
need
a
general
statute
for
other
groups
in
the
state.
the
problem
here--
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
--there's
no
need
for
a
broader
law,
and
no,
i
don't
think
that
it's
dangerous
for
the
reason
that
when
you
need
accommodation
sometimes
you
have
a
specific
problem.
the
burden
that
were
on...
that
were
on
the
hasidic
parents
and
children
of
this
community
is
not
a
burden
that
was
shared
by
the
rest
of
the
state
or
the
rest
of
the
country.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
when
there
needs
to
be
new
lines
drawn
other
than
the
historically
existing
school
districts,
yes.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
well,
normally
these
special
lines
that
are
drawn
by
the
legislature
are
called
special
acts
school
districts,
and
they
are
coterminous
with
institutions,
so
they
would
be
created
in
response
to
a
need
for
them,
which
is
what
happened
here.
there
was
a
need
for
this,
because
what
the
state
was
faced
with
was
an
impasse
between
the
parents
of
handicapped
students
living
in
the
village
and
their
school
district,
which
is
monroe-woodbury,
over
whether
these
special
needs--
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
--i
don't
think...
they
could
have
done
the
former.
they
could
have
done
anything.
the
problem
with
the
former
is
that
there
would
be
more
of
an
argument
to
be
made
that
in
this
impasse,
in
this
dispute
between
the
monroe-woodbury
school
district
and
the
kiryas
joel
parents,
that
they
would
be
taking
sides
more
by
taking
the
discretion
that
monroe-woodbury
enjoys
along
with
the
rest
of
the
school
districts
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
terms
of
where
they
choose
to
apply--
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
--i
think
there
would
have
been?
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
in
fact,
you
can
make
the
exact
same
arguments
that
they're
making
here.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
that
was
her
position,
but
we
disagree
with
her
position,
because
if
the
new
york
state
legislature
and
governor
enacted
a
law
that
said
to
monroe-woodbury
you
must
relinquish
your
discretion
and
you
must
provide
a
neutral
site
against
your
judgment,
against
your
wishes,
to
these
religious
people
in
this
religious
community,
there
would
be
people
back
in
court
saying,
you
have
favored
the
satmar
sect,
you
have...
you
are
advancing
their
religion
by--
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
--well,
i
actually
believe
we
would
have
had
a
harder
case.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
we
believe
you
still
can't
say
that,
because
the
transfer
of
the
power
was
not
to
any
religious
organization,
it
was
to
the
residents
of
a
community.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
yes.
that
is
in
the
record.
the
power
was
given
by
the
statute
to
the
residents
of
the
community,
and
not
to
any
religious
organization.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
there's
one
factor
in
between,
which
is
that
this
is
a
cultural
and
sociological
problem
which
arose
out
of
these
people's
religion,
so
it's
one
step
removed
from
the
religion.
what
the
state
did
was
to
address
the
cultural,
secular,
sociological
side
of
the
problem
without
preferring
or
promoting
or
advancing
the
actual
religious
tenets.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
certainly.
there
was
a
deadlock.
it
was
an
absolute
deadlock
between
the
parents
of
disabled,
handicapped
children
who
need
specially
appropriate
educational
services--
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
--which
were
not
being
provided...
the
parents
felt--
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
--they
were
not
appropriate
according
to
these
parents.
they
felt
that
these
services
were
not
being
provided
by
monroe-woodbury,
because
the
services
that
they
were
offering
was
not
appropriate
to
these
children's
unique
and
special
needs.
they
did
not
address--
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
--they
felt
that
they
were
not
addressing
their
unique
vulnerabilities
and
needs
because
they
come
from
a
very
insular
environment,
where
they
don't
have
television,
they
don't
have
radio,
they
don't
have
english
language
newspapers,
they
don't
watch
a
cartoon,
and
when
they
go
to
the
monroe-woodbury
schools
with
children
who
dress
differently,
who
speak
differently,
these...
the
kiryas
joel
children
don't
particularly
speak
english.
their
first
language
is
yiddish.
this
environment
was
so
alien
to
them
that
they
felt
that
it
had
a
very
negative
effect.
the
emotional
and
psychological
trauma
that
they
suffered
had
a
very
negative
effect
on
their
educational
process,
so
much
so
that
they
felt
that
that
overpowered
their
need
to
be
in
school.
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
the
parents
of
these
children,
and
they
took
them
out
of
the
school,
so
when
this
came
to
the
state...
this
did
not
come
to
the
state
in
the
first
instance.
this
problem
was
with
the
parties
for
a
while.
it
went
through
the
entire
appellate
court
process,
and
at
the
top
of
the
process--
ms.
julie
s.
mereson
--it
was
more
than
that,
justice
stevens.
it
was
that
they
felt
that
the
insularity
of
the
community
did
not
permit
them
to
participate
in
the
education
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
get
anything
positive
out
of
it,
because
they
were
so
traumatized
by
being
in
an
environment
that
was
alien
to
theirs.
