mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
that
is
being
challenged
in
this
case
as
inconsistent
on
its
face
with
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
involves
no
governmental
participation
in
the
teaching
and
propagation
of
religious
doctrine
and
underwrites
no
public
employee
to
participate
directly
in
religious
indoctrination.
these
were
factors
that
were
present
in
the
government
program
that
the
court
sustained
last
term
in
the
zobrest
case,
and
they
led
justices
blackmun
and
souter
to
dissent
in
that
case.
by
contrast,
the
new
york
legislature
has
authorized
the
residents
of
a
legally
incorporated
village
that
has
existed
since
1977
that
elects
a
mayor
and
a
village
board
and
enacts
ordinances
that
comprise
the
code
of
the
village
of
kiryas
joel
to
operate
a
wholly
secular
public
school.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is
an
independent...
yes,
justice--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--the
legislature
in
new
york
has...
does
enact
laws
that
creates
school
districts
and
bounds
of
school
districts.
that's
referred
to
specifically
in
the
complaint
in
this
case.
that's
the
way
the--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--it's
formed
by
acts
of
the
legislature.
mr.
nathan
lewin
my
understanding
is
that
that's
correct.
the
enactment
of
the
boundaries
of
school
districts
is
done
by
legislative
enactment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
by
some
general
law.
mr.
nathan
lewin
correct.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
that's
not
a
fair
characterization.
it
was
transferred
to
the
residents
of
a
village.
those
residents
are
indeed
all
of
a
particular
religious
denomination,
and
very
devoutly
so,
but
the...
it
was
not
that
the
statute
in
any
way
itself
drew
lines
that
distinguished
on
the
basis
of
religion.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
think
so,
not
even
under
those
circumstances,
although
that's
not
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
think
that
if
in
fact,
as
a
matter
of
legislative
accommodation,
a
group
of
individuals
residing
in
a
particular
geographic
area
would
warrant
having
a
separate
public
school
for
secular
reasons,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
it
would
be
permissible
to
accommodate
to
them,
and...
or
even
to
accommodate
to
their
religious
practice.
our
view
is
that
accommodation
by
the
legislature
to
the
needs
of
a
religious
community
is
permissible.
my
example
would
be,
for
example,
this
book
covers
garbage
disposal
within
the
village
of
kiryas
joel.
there's
a
code
that
talks
about
trash
disposal.
if
a
community,
for
example,
said,
we
will
not
accept
trash
disposal
on
the
sabbath,
on
saturday...
we
think
it's
inappropriate
for
religious
reasons...
if
the
legislature
then
said,
all
right,
for
that
reason
we'll
allow
you
to
conduct
your
own
trash
disposal
on
some
other
day
of
the
week,
and
you
do
it
yourself,
we
think
that's
within
the
spirit
of
what
the
free
exercise
laws--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
it's
this
court's
decision
in
aguilar
that
precipitated
the
situation
that
required
some
action
to
be
taken
regarding
the
disabled
children
of
kiryas
joel.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
it
would
have
been
permissible.
indeed,
it
appears
from
the
position
of
the
monroe-woodbury
school
district
that
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
overall
school
district,
this
is
a
preferable
accommodation.
the
monroe-woodbury
school
district
did
not
want
to
provide
teaching
at
a
neutral
site
in
kiryas
joel.
they--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
if...
we
agree
that
if,
in
fact,
the
services
were
being
provided
under
the
pre-aguilar
procedure,
there
would
not
have
been
any
justification
for
the
legislature
saying
we
have
to
accommodate
or
we
have
to
take
this
step.
under
those
circumstances,
there
would
be
much
more
basis
to
argue
that
this
is
only
being
done
to
provide
some
kind
of
authority
to
these
citizens
who
happen
to
be
religious.
mr.
nathan
lewin
justice
souter,
i
think
the
record
really
establishes
the
contrary.
the
record
establishes
that
what
happened
in
this
case...
and
it
appears
in
the
very
first
pages
of
the
joint
appendix...
that
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
the
original
village
that
was
proposed...
and
that's
at
page
12
of
the
joint
appendix...
the
satmars
presented
a
petition
to
form
a
new
village
of
very
large
dimensions
which
included
many
properties
and
people
not
of
the
satmar
belief,
so
that
consequently
the
original
petition
was
not
in
any
way
limited
by
where
satmar
hasidim
happened
to
live.
what
happened,
the
real
basis
for
the
creation
of
the
village
was
a
zoning
dispute.
since
satmar
hasidim
have
large
families...
indeed,
i
think
the
record
shows
there's
over
60
percent
of
the
population
is
under
17
years
of
age,
they
needed
homes
which
would
accommodate
larger
families,
and
that
precipitated,
as
i
say,
a
zoning
dispute.
the
consequence
ultimately
was,
as
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix
shows,
that
a
new
village
on
a
much
smaller
scale
than
originally
proposed
was
presented
only
because
the
people
who
were
to
be
included
in
the
larger
area
said
they
did
not
want
to
be
in
this
village,
so
that
the--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
justice
scalia,
of
course,
our
view
is
that
the
accommodation
authority
that
legislatures
have
and
that
this
court
has
recognized...
indeed,
even
as
strong
a
proponent
of
the
establishment
clause
as
justice
brennan
in
his
texas
monthly
case
in
footnote
8
specifically
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
authority
to
accommodate
is
far
broader
than
the
mere
confines
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
our
view,
of
course,
is
that
that--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--that
turns
the
first
amendment
on
its
head.
that
essentially
means
that
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
which
is
protected
by
the
constitution,
becomes
the
one
impermissible
vice
that
invalidates
anything
that's
done,
and
we
think--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--the
consequence
was...
yes,
justice
souter,
that
they
are...
all
the
residents
of
the
village
are
satmar
hasidim,
but
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--there's
no
dispute,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
the
petitioners
have
never
challenged
the
existence
of
the
village.
they've--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--we
acknowledge
that.
it
would
be
more
difficult.
the
question
then
would
be
squarely
presented
whether,
in
order
to
accommodate
a
religious
group
living
within
an
area
which
had
not
previously
defined,
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
legislature
to
draw
lines
to
accommodate
that
religious
group,
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
again,
with
the
caveat
that
that
is
not
by
any
means
this
case--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--we
believe
that
that
is
part
of
the
spirit
of
accommodation,
that
if
in
fact--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--absolutely
not.
we
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg.
it
would
be
impermissible,
and
here
the
important
point
is
that
this
property
of
the
village
is
privately
owned
by
its
residents.
they
have
chosen
to
purchase
the
property
and
to
live
together,
and
anybody...
anybody
in
this
room,
anybody
in
new
york
state,
is
permitted,
and
indeed,
under
new
york
law,
may
not
be
discriminated
against
if
they
choose
to
seek
to
purchase
property
in
that
village.
mr.
nathan
lewin
all...
no,
justice
blackmun.
currently...
again,
initially
when
the
school
district
was
created,
it
was
created
with
the
intention
of
serving
the
students
in
kiryas
joel,
the
children
of
kiryas
joel.
once
it
was
created,
since
it
provides
a
bilingual
and
bicultural
program,
there
are
other
students
who
have...
who
are
disabled
from
other
neighboring
communities
who
have
been
permitted,
under
procedures
which,
justice
o'connor,
in
line
with
your
question
as
to
whether
this
is
universal,
with
procedures
which
are
universal
with
regard
to
other
school
districts
and
other
circumstances
have
been
permitted
to
attend
this
public
school
which
neighbors
or
adjoins
their
own
home
districts.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
percentage
runs
maybe
10
to
20
percent
or
so.
i
don't
think
it's
higher
than
that.
it
is
a
very--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--it
is
a
relatively
small
number,
but
there
are
a
number
of
them
that--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--yes,
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
this
school,
justice
stevens,
boys
and
girls
go
to
class
together.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is
consistent
with
the
religious
doctrine,
because
the
views
of
the
satmar
hasidim
and
of
their
religious
authorities
is
that
when
the
purpose
of
education
is
this
kind
of
remedial
education,
which
is
to...
it
is
permissible
to
have
boys
and
girls
study
together,
and
so
that
that
has
been
approved
by...
or
has
long
been
the
practice
within
the
religious
community.
mr.
nathan
lewin
my
understanding
is
yes,
it
was
always
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
near
harriman...
monroe,
is
it
near
rochester...
it's
further
south,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'm
sorry,
i...
orange
county.
it's
in
orange
county.
i'm
sorry.
the
points
that
we
wish
to
emphasize
with
regard
to
this
statute
is
that
it
is
a
legislative
determination.
justice
o'connor
asked
whether
this
applied
uniformly.
as
we
have
indicated,
accommodations,
we
believe,
can
be
applied,
and
always
are
applied,
indeed,
to
particular
situations.
this
court
said
in
its
employment
division
v.
smith
case,
for
example,
that
if
there
were
a
legislative
exemption
for
the
smoking
of
peyote,
that
would
be
permissible.
now,
that
by
its
very
nature
applies
only
to
one
religious
group,
because...
for
its
religious
practice,
and
consequently
we--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--the
sabbatarian--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
that
was--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--with
all
respect,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
sabbatarian
case
was
one
in
which
this
court
felt
that
there
was
a
burden
on
others
to
pick
up
for
the
sabbatarian,
and
in
that
footnote
in
which
justice
brennan
in
his
texas
monthly
case
speaks
of
accommodations,
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
that's
a
distinction,
whether
the
nonobservers
are
burdened
by
the
statute.
in
this
case,
there's
no
burden
on
anyone
else.
this
is
simply
a
statute
which
applies
to
this
municipality
and
essentially
what
the
courts
below
have
said
is
that
these
people,
because
they
are
religious,
cannot
be
trusted
to
run
a
public
school
system.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
need
for
accommodation,
i
don't
think
the
range
of
accommodations.
in
other
words,
this
is
not
an
area...
and
i
know
that
there
is
one
judge
in
the
court
below,
judge
kaye--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--judge
kaye,
who
said,
look,
this...
the
least
restrictive
alternatives
standard
should
apply.
we
think
that's
wrong.
when
the
legislature--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
think
that's
true,
and
i
think
it's
particularly
important
in
deciding
whether
there
should
be
any
accommodation
at
all,
and
under
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
it
appeared
to
me
there's
no
need
for
any
accommodation
because
this
very
same
service
is
being
performed
neutrally
by
the
regular
procedures
in
a
way
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
religious
observance.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--we
agree
with
that
entirely,
justice
ginsburg.
they
have
no
choice,
and
if
anybody
comes
in
and
wants
to
live
in
that
community
and
purchase
a
home,
they're
entitled
to
do
so.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
nathan
lewin
with
respect
to
judge
kaye's
suggestion,
justice
souter,
we,
in
addition
to
thinking
it's
the
wrong
test,
we
think
it's
not
clear
that
that's
the
least
restrictive
alternative
by
any
means.
providing
responsibility,
as
well
as
authority,
is
what
this
statute
did,
and
what
is
one
going
to
conclude,
what
is
the
least
restrictive
alternative?
monroe-woodbury
school
district
itself
prefers
this
solution,
which
apparently
it
believes
is
less
restrictive
in
terms
of
the
overall
school
district,
than
the
solution
of
forcing
them
to
provide
neutral
sites.
justice
kennedy
asked
about
the
purpose,
and
i
think
that
clearly
distinguishes
this
case
and
makes
it
so
much
stronger
than
the
hypothetical
that
the
chief
justice
suggested.
in
this
case,
there
are
a
body
of
disabled
students.
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
it
is
a
community
that
wants
to
have
its
own
school
district,
and
there's
nothing
unconstitutional,
even
if
they're
religious,
and
we
agree.
but
all
the
more
so
is
that
true
if
there
is
a
reason
for
the
legislature
to
deal
with
a
group
of
disabled
students,
and
in
this
case,
the
record
is
clear
from
the
respondents'
own
expert,
joint
appendix
page
88.
she
says,
"these
parents
kept
their
children
out
of
the
public
school
to
avoid
the
trauma
they
believe
the
children
would
suffer
because
of
their
cultural
uniqueness.
"
that's
what
their
own
expert
said
in
an
affidavit
that's
in
the
record.
and
in
response
to
justice
o'connor
with
regard
to
other...
other
school
districts,
the
complaint
itself
alleges
in
paragraph
63
of
the
second
amended
complaint,
at
page
62
of
the
appendix,
"the
legislature
has
exercised
this
authority
most
commonly
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
public
school
in
the
case
of....
"
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you.
