mr.
paul
van
tricht
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
was
not
privy
to
the
income
tax
collection
of
montana.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
we
do
not
know,
no.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
in
fact,
it
is,
because
under
montana
law
i
can
only
have
access
to
montana
income
tax
records
if
i
am
prosecuting
an
income
tax
case.
we
have
a
very
strict
confidentiality
provision
which
basically
says
that
i
cannot
go
down,
and
out
of
curiosity,
or
even
in
connect...
conjunction
with
another
case,
look
at
the
income
tax
returns.
it's
similar
to
the
federal,
although
we
have
a
fire
law
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
the
income
tax
returns.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
under
the
montana
income
tax
law
the
kurths,
the
family
or
the
individual
members
of
the
family,
would
be
subject
to
income
tax
on
the
income
earned
from
growing
marijuana.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
even
if
it
was
illegal
income.
it's
identical
to
the
federal
law.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
this
tax?
mr.
paul
van
tricht
there
is
a
criminal
provision
in
the
code.
there
is
referenced
in
the
code
a
criminal
provision,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
under
my
understanding
of
the
montana
interpretation
of
double
jeopardy,
i
don't
think...
under
the
state
rule,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
possible.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
as
i
understand
montana's
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
the...
of
our
double...
constitutional
double
jeopardy
provisions
and
the
montana
constitution,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
possible.
but
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well,
your
honor,
this
brings
up--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--you...
well,
your
honor,
this
brings
up
one
point.
under
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
the
leary
case
and
marchetti,
it
is...
we
cannot
really
compel
the
filing
of
a
tax
return
without
running...
potentially
running
a
file
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
oh,
we
can
only
actually
enforce
it
if...
we
can
only
actually
bring
an
enforcement
action
if
there's
not
a
payment
of
the
tax
assessment.
your
honor,
montana
has
a
tax
of
$100
an
ounce
on
marijuana.
the
tax
assessment
before
this
court
is
$181,000
because
the
kurth
family
had
possessed
100...
1,800
ounces
of
marijuana.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
rather
quite
simple;
is
the
tax
a
tax
or
a
penalty
and
is
this...
and
does
this
particular
tax
assessment
violate
the
kurth's
rights
under
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment?
the
lower
federal
courts
held
that
the
tax
was
a
penalty
and
that
this
assessment
did
violate
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
of
the
fifth
amendment.
this
decision
stands
in
contrast
and
in
conflict
to
a
prior
montana
supreme
court
decision
that
held
that
this
tax
was
not
a
penalty
and
therefore
could
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
provisions.
montana...
the
lower
federal
courts
based
their
decision
on
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
halper.
montana's
basic
position
is
that
the
halper
decision
does
not
apply
because
this
tax
is
a
true
tax
and
not
a
penalty,
and
we
believe
it's
a
true
tax
based
upon
two
factors:
one,
the
legislature
intended
to
create
a
tax
and,
two,
this
court's
past
decisions
on
similar
tax
upheld
federal
taxes
of
a
similar
nature.
now,
because--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--by
the
time...
by
the
time...
the
assessment
procedures
had
not
been
completed
by
the
time
there
was
the
criminal
sentencing
proceedings.
that
there
was
a
contest.
the
kurths...
there
was
a
initial
tax
assessment,
the
kurths
contested
that
assessment,
and
administrative
proceedings
began
before
the
department
of
revenue
which
would
have
resulted
in
a
final
decision.
that...
those...
that
process
was
never
completed.
the
kurths
filed
bankruptcy
and
the
montana
department
of
revenue
filed
a
proof
of
claim
and
a
motion
for
relief
from
the
automatic
stay.
that
was
denied
and
then
we
went
into
the
adversary
proceedings.
so
by
the
time...
by
the
time
the
bankruptcy
court
issued
its
decision
upon
the
last...
on
the
assessment
itself,
richard
kurth
was
already
out
of
jail.
so
there
was
no
way
to
merge
the
two,
if
it
were
desired.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
in
my
experience
they
have
never
been
merged.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well,
actually
merger
would
create
a
great
deal
of
problems
because
we're
talking
about
an
apples
and
oranges
proceeding.
the
criminal
proceedings
have
a
much
different
procedural
process--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--yes,
we
wouldn't
have
this
problem,
but
we
would
have
a
great
deal
more
problems
in--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well,
the
impediment
in
this
case
was
the
fact
that
we
hadn't
completed
our
assessment
procedure.
we
didn't...
we
hadn't...
the
department,
itself
had
an
initial
assessment
and
then
the
proceedings
would
have
gone
on
through
a...
through
an
adversary
proceeding
before
a
hearing
officer
of
the
department,
which
would
have
resulted
in
a
final
assessment.
so
we
really
didn't...
the
department
really
hadn't
nailed
down
the
final
assessment
on
this
particular
tax
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
yes,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
because
there's
a
different--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--there's
a
different
intent
by
the
legislature.
in
one
action
they're
intending
to
create
a
tax,
in
another
act
they're
intending
to
create
a
penalty
or
sanction.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
i
believe--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--i
believe
it
does
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
of
this
court's
past
decisions
which
upheld
similar
or
nearly
identical
federal
taxes.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
no,
your
honor.
it's
the
structure,
the
entire
statute
itself
that
the
court
has
to
analyze
in
the
determination
of
whether
it
is
a
tax
or
a
sanction.
and
in
this...
and
the
court
also
has
to
look
at
past...
its
past
decisions
on
similar
federal
taxes
in
that
analysis.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
your
honor,
it's...
it's
not
the
normal
structure,
but
there's
a
least
one
federal
tax
that
has
the
same
structure,
and
that's
the
tax
on
small
cigars
which
is
12.5
percent
or
$30
per
thousand
cigars,
whichever
is
greater.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
so
there...
it
is
a...
not
a
normal,
but
it
is
not
an
unusual.
it
has
been
done
in
the
past.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--for
the
purposes
of
analyzing
under
halper,
it
makes
a
difference,
your
honor,
because
we're
dealing
about
the
halper
decision
and
halper
was
talking
about
penalties
and
not
taxes.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
often
recognized
that
a
tax
has
both
regulatory
and...
effects
and
not...
effects
other
than
its...
just
its
purely
revenue-raising
effect.
and
so
there
are
certain
aspects
in
a
tax
which
to
some
people
may
seem
nontax.
like,
for
example,
a
high
tax
on
alcohol
may
have
the
purpose
of
discouraging
alcoholic
consumption.
but
i
don't
think
that
that...
that
that
is
a
collateral
issue
which
does
not
change
the
basic
intent
of
congress
or
the
legislature
to
enact
the
revenue-raising
measure.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
your
honor,
the
taxable...
the
taxable
event
is
the
coming
into
possession
of
the
marijuana.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
yes.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well,
if
the
state
became
aware
of
the
possession,
then
it's
contraband
and
it
would
be
seized,
unless
there
was
some--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--well,
your
honor,
montana
fully
recognizes
this
is
an
illegal
activity
that
it's
taxing,
and
the
statute's
structure
fully
recognizes
that
and
the
rules
recognize
that.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
yes,
yes,
yes.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well,
your
honor,
if
he
had
a
plant
and
it
grew
to
a
certain,
you
know...
a
pound,
he
would
owe
a
tax.
if
it
added
another
pound,
he
would
owe
a
tax
on
that
additional
pound.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
we
tax
the
possession
once
and
it's...
and
each
time...
each
new
possession
of
a
different
amount
of
marijuana--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--or
new
marijuana
is
the
taxable
event.
there's
no...
once
the
tax
is
due
on
the
old
marijuana,
there's
no
additional
tax
on
that
marijuana.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
in
that
event
the
state
would
get
more...
additional
revenue,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well,
your
honor,
this
brings--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--your
honor,
this
brings
up
one
point.
we
tax
the
dried
weight
of
the
marijuana
at
this
point.
we
have...
we
had
an
extended
bit
of
litigation
upon
whether
we
were
taxing
the
wet
or
the
dry
weight
of
marijuana,
and
we
tax
the
dry
weight.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
your
honor,
the
kurths
were
producing
two...
they
had
1,800
ounces
of
marijuana.
of
that
2,000...
200
ounces
were
what's
called
bud
marijuana
which
was
sold
at
wholesale
at
$1,800
a
pound.
the
remainder...
and
it
was
sold
in
smaller
retail
quantities...
that's...
retail
quantity
is
a
quarter
ounce...
it
would
go
anywhere
from
$200
to
$400
an
ounce
in
small
quantities.
the
remainder,
the
1,600
ounce,
the
remaining
1,600
ounces
was
shake,
and
that's
the
stems
and
the
leaves
of
the
marijuana
plant.
at
wholesale
that
shake
sold
for
$200
a
pound,
at
retail
it
sold
for
$250
to
$500
a
pound,
and
if
it
was...
if
it
were
sold
in
smaller
quantities
it
would...
like
a
quarter
ounce,
in
quarter
ounce
quantities,
it
would
sell
anywhere
from
$60
to
$120
an
ounce.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
the
tax
on
the
shake
was
$100
an
ounce.
the
tax
on
the
stems
and
leaves
was
$100
an
ounce.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
the
value
of
that...
the
value...
the
value
of
marijuana
is
dependant
upon
what
is
the--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--well,
both
of
them...
both
the
shake
and
the
marijuana
bud
are
marijuana.
both
the
shake
and
the
marijuana
bud
were
being
sold
in
chouteau
county.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well,
shake
of
the
quality
that
the...
that
we
have
here
were
being
sold
for
the
purposes
of
making
marijuana
cigarettes
and
smoking,
in
addition
to
making
marijuana
oil.
the
kurths
didn't
sell
shake,
but
shake
of
that...
of
a
similar
quantity
that
the
kurths
possessed
was
being
sold
in
montana
at
that
time,
in
quarter
ounces
and
ounces
and
pound
portions.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
the
tax
on
that
commodity,
taking
the
lowest
price,
would
be
eight
times
the
value.
if
you...
if
you--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--yes.
if
you...
if
you
determine
the
value
at
another--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--but
remember,
your
honor,
we're
taxing
the
entire...
all
marijuana.
as
in
any
circumstances,
you're
going
to
have...
if
you
tax
any
type
of
product,
you're
going
to
have
low-value
product
and
high-value
product
and
all
the
way
down
the
stream.
the--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--yes,
that's
the
only
issue.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
well--
mr.
paul
van
tricht
--the
tax
is
$100
an
ounce
applicable
to
marijuana,
whether
it's
marijuana
bud
or
shake.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
considerably
more
expensive,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
tax
to
marijuana
bud,
the
rate...
the...
in
all
instances
the
tax
is
less
than
the
value.
it
starts...
the
value
starts
at
a
minimum
of
about
$1,800
a
pound
and
then
goes
up,
and
it
could
go
up
considerably.
as
i
said,
the
record
shows
values
in...
up
to
$400
a
ounce.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
your
honor,
in
this
particular
instance
the
kurths
were
engaged
in
growing
marijuana
since
january
of
1986.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
the
only
tax
they
are
now
being
assessed
with
is
the
tax...
is
the
amount
they
had
in
october
of
1987.
mr.
paul
van
tricht
yes,
your
honor.
i
thank
the
court.
