save
your
talking
until
you
get
outside

we'll

93-144,
department
of
revenue
of
montana
v.
kurth
ranch.
you're
admonished
not
to
talk
while
the
court
is
in
session.
mr.
van
tricht.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
halper
also
said
it
was
a
very
narrowly
confined
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
why...
why
don't
you
take
the
position
that
even
though
there
may
be
some
sanction
or
penal
effect,
if
there's...
if
it's
also
arguably
a
tax,
you
win?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
ratio
of
tax
to
value
in
the
case
of
marijuana
bud?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
van
tricht.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
goetz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
important
is
that
percentage,
mr.
goetz?
do
we
apply
the
same
sort
of
analysis
if
someone
comes
in
and
challenges
a
cigarette
tax,
to
say
that
the
basic
product
is
only
worth
25
cents
and
yet
the
government
has
put
a
tax
of
$1.50
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
trying
to
make
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
but
if
the
figure
got
high
enough
then?
if,
you
know,
instead
of
putting
$1.50
tax
on
stuff
that's
worth
25
cents
at
retail,
they
put
$3
on,
then
it
would
bring
it
into
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
enough
if
the
tax
has
a
very
substantial
deterrent
effect
to
at
least
turn
that
factor
against
its
validity
as
a
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
referring
to
those
cases
where
the
challenge
was
made
that
this
isn't
under
the
congress'
taxing
power,
and
therefore
it
has
to
be
under
some
other
power,
and
congress
doesn't
have
that
power?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
you're
talking,
mr.
goetz,
about
tax
classifications.
you
know,
you
get
various
categories
taxed
at
different
levels.
and
i
think
that's
quite
a
different
type
of
review
than
the
challenge
is
this
a
tax
or
is
it
not
a
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
most
of
the
cases
in
which
are
relaxed
scrutiny,
lenhausen,
that
group
of
cases,
the
challenge
has
been
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
surely
the
equal
protection
clause
deserves
as
much
constitutional
recognition
as
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say...
you
say
the
equal
protection
clause
generally
isn't
of
the
same
statue
or
stature
in
the
constitution
as
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
tax
was
upheld
in
sanchez,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goetz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
more
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
