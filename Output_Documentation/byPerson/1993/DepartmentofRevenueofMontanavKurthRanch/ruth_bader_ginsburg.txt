mr.
van
tricht,
just
as
a
matter
of
montana
procedure,
why
wasn't
this
tax
made
part
of
the
plea
and
sentencing
proceeding,
the
criminal
proceedings
against
the
kurth
family?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
sounds,
from
what
you
describe,
that
it
is...
it
would
not
be
the
common
pattern
to
have
the
two
merged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
was
settled
by
plea,
wasn't
it?
there
was
no
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
criminal.
so
you
could
have...
if
you
had
the
two
together,
you
could
have
negotiated
both
at
the
same
time
and
had
them...
you
wouldn't...
i
don't
understand
what
the
impediments
would
be
if
you
didn't...
if
you
were
dealing
by
a
plea
rather
than
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this...
there's
one
portion
of
this,
what
you
call
shake,
where
it's
at
800
percent,
the
tax,
is
it
not?
there
was
a
disparity
between
the
rate
applicable
to
the
marijuana
and
the
rate
applicable
to
the
shake,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
what
was
the
tax
on
that
$200
to
$500
a
pound?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
value
of
that
was
how
much
an
ounce?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
there
was
a
separate
value...
there
were
two
separate
commodities.
the
shake
sold
for
some...
whatever
oil
it
eventually
could
make
and
the
other
sold
as
marijuana.
is
that
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
for
different
purposes,
and
one
was
more
expensive
than
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
trying
to
get
an
understanding
of
what
was
the
tax
on
that
commodity
in
relation
to
the
value
of
that
commodity,
the
market
value
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
tax
was
eight
times
the
value.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
a
tax
that's
eight
times
the
value.
i
heard
that
the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy;
it
seems
that
would
clearly
apply
to
something
eight
times
the
value.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
there's
only
two
that
were
at
issue
here,
the
marijuana
that
was...
and
the
shake.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
different
rates
applicable
to
each.
what
was
the
rate
applicable
to
the...
to
the
marijuana?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
bud...
the
marijuana
bud
is
a
much
more
expensive
commodity,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
in
your
brief,
to
describe
what
would
be
permissible,
that
this
has
to
be
within
the
general
range
of
sin...
similar
taxes,
has
to
be
something
that
is
an
ordinary
kind
of
tax,
and
you
give
the
sin
tax
as
an
example.
how
does
one
know
whether
the
rates
that
are
here
are
within
the
general
range
of
sin
taxes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah,
i
know,
but
that's
not
at
issue
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
terms
of
the
total
amount
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
the
80
percent
rate
was
on
how
much
and
the
higher
rate
was
on
high
much?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
higher
rate
was
on...
the
eight
times
was
on
much
more,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wouldn't
one
say
that
to
the
extent
that
the
product
was
not
the
buds
but
the
shake,
that
it
wasn't...
that
that
rate
was
not
within
the
general
range
of
such
taxes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
say
in
your
test
in
your
brief
that
you
would
look
to
see
whether
it
was
in...
within
the
general
range,
so...
and
here
we
go
from
a
range
of
80
percent
to
800
percent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
we
get
an
example
that
there
was
one
federal
tax
that
has
the
either/or,
so
it's
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
think
the
answer
was
that
it's
not
common,
but
it's
not
extraordinary.
