anthony
m.
kennedy
--before
you
say
good
morning
and
begin
your
argument,
i'll
have
one
more
question.
[laughter]
would
there
be
a
violation,
a
criminal
violation
for
failure
to
pay
the
tax
that's
involved
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
is
there
a
separate
crime
for
the
failure
to
pay
this
tax?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
could
have
been
a
criminal
prosecution
here
for
failure
to
pay
the
tax?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
excuse
me,
would
not
be
possible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
refer
to
report,
and
i
take
it
the
word
report,
in
your
view,
is
the
report
that's
filed
by
the
law-enforcement
officials
in
lieu
of
the
defendant
having
done
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
minnesota
collect
any
money
off
that
scheme?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
too
many
stamps
being
sold?
[laughter]
