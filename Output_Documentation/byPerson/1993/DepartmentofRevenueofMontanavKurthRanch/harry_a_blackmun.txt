justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
before
you
get
underway,
straighten
me
out
on
a
fact
or
two.
does
montana
have
an
income
tax?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
this
income
subjected
to
that
tax
as
well
as
to
the
marijuana
tax?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
don't
know
whether
it
was
doubly
taxed.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
hard
to
find
out?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'll
ask
opposing
counsel
then.
could
i
ask
you
a
slightly
different
question,
following
up
on
justice
blackmun?
would...
under
the
montana
income
tax
law,
would
it
be
appropriate
for
this
taxpayer
to
pay
an...
file
an
income
tax
return
and
pay
the
tax,
whether
he
did
it
or
not?
is
he
subject
to
the
law?
