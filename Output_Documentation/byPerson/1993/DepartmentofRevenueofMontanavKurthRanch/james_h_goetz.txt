mr.
james
h.
goetz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i
would
like
to
answer
justice
blackmun's
question.
the
answer
is
that
the
income
of
richard
and
judith
kurth
was
taxed
as...
income
taxed.
the
income
received
by
the
halleys
and
the
younger
kurths
from
the
operation,
that
is
their
income
as
employees,
was
taxed
and
paid
by
them.
moving
to
the
tax
as
it
operates
in
this...
in
the
state
of
montana...
well,
before
i
do
that,
one
question
posed
by
justice
scalia,
i
think,
merits
an
answer
from
our
perspective,
and
that
is
can
a
tax
be
called
a
tax
and
serve
a
dual
function?
and
if
so,
what
is
the
consequence?
well,
i
think
both
halper
and
austin
were
quite
clear
on
that
point.
my
position
is
you
can
call
something
it
a
tax,
it
can
raise
revenue
and
therefore
it
can
be
a
tax,
and
it
can
also
punish,
and
it
can
be
punishment
for
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
austin
said
precisely
on
that
dual-purpose
point,
fundamentally,
even
assuming
that
the
statutes
in
question
there
served
some
remedial
purpose,
the
government's
argument
must
fail.
a
civil
sanction...
and
they're
quoting
now
from
halper...
a
civil
sanction
that
cannot
be
fairly
said
solely
to
serve
a
remedial
purpose,
but
rather
can
only
be
explained
as
also
serving
either
retribution
or
deterrent
purposes,
is
punishment.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
exactly.
and
the
issue
really
here,
halper
and
austin
set
aside,
is
can
you
have
a
tax
which
is,
under
the
guise
of
a
tax,
at
least
in
part
punishment.
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
multiple
punishment,
and
so
if
we
return
to
the
fundamental
question
then
we
have
to
ask
whether
a
tax
has
an
aspect
of
punishment,
and
if
it
does
then
double
jeopardy
is
implicated.
now,
turning
to
the
question
posed
by
justice
stevens,
the
answer
is
that...
and
mr.
van
tricht
i
think
made
this
point...
that
although
this
is
called
a
tax
on
possession,
this
is
contraband
and
it
would
be
seized
at
the
time
the
government
realizes
that
the
person
possesses
or
stores.
turning
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
on
the
quantities
of
the
shake,
what
happened
here
is
they
weighed
approximately
100
pounds
of
shake,
which
is
low
grade
stems
and
seeds,
bags
of
marijuana
product,
100
pounds
or
1,600
ounces.
there
were
a
total
of
1,811
ounces
in
this
case,
so
most
of
the
product
was
the
low-grade
shake,
approximately
90
percent.
and
that
is
worth...
and
the
record
shows
$200.
now,
the
argument
here
is,
well,
at
retail
it
might
be
worth
more,
and
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
of
if
you
used
something
called
the
mari-gin
you
can
process
it
to
get
some
of
the
higher-quality
marijuana
out.
but,
of
course,
that
would
reduce
the
weight.
and
so
the
plain
and
simple
fact
is
that
that
was
worth
$200
and
it
was
taxed
at
$1,600--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--a
pound.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
$200
a
pound
and
taxed
at
$1,600
a
pound,
eight
times
its
market
value,
90
percent
of
the
product
at
issue
here.
looking
at
the
other
aspects
of
the
tax...
and
it
might
help,
i've--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--well,
the
problem
with
the
cigarette-tax
analogy
that
they
try
to
make
is
they're
mixing
up
retail--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--okay.
you...
in
my
view
you
can't
compare
retail
sales
value
with
the
wholesale
value
of
the
product
that
we
have
here
or
which
we
have
in
tobacco
raw
product.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
it
might
well.
i
think
it
depends
on
an
analysis
at
the
trial
level
of
elasticity
of
demand.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
tax
that
is
so
great
that
there
is
essentially
no
market
for
the
product,
then
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
indicator
that
that's
not
a
true
tax.
it
may
indeed
be
a
penalty.
it
may
not
be
dispositive,
but
it
is
one
of
the
indicators.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
as
one
of
the
indicators,
yes.
and
it
depends
on
the
facts,
how
dispositive
that
excessiveness
or
proportionality
might
be.
now,
when
you--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--halper,
i
think,
states
explicitly
that
if
you
impose
the
tax
at
the
same
proceeding,
or
a
civil
sanction
in
halper's
case,
then
double
jeopardy
isn't
implicated.
i...
your
question
is
would
i
have
a
problem.
then
we
trigger
the
eighth
amendment
excessive
fines
issue,
and
it
depends
on
what
this
court
means
by
excessive
fines.
but
as
far
as
double
jeopardy,
the
answer
is
no.
now,
looking
at
the
mechanics
of
this
tax...
and
i've
appended
the
regulations
to
my
brief
at
the
end
after
page
46.
and
i
think
the
regulations
make
it
quite
clear,
the
nature
of
this
so-called
tax.
first,
if
we
look
at
regulation
42.34.101
under
definitions,
the
state
defines
market
value.
and
market
value
is
the
value
of
the
substance
at
the
time
of
confiscation
or
report,
and
the
use
of
the
word
confiscation
i
think
relates
to
justice
stevens'
question.
the
answer
is,
of
course,
this
is
contraband,
and
if
it's
innocently
reported,
then
it
will
be
confiscated
or
seized.
but
more
importantly...
and
the
theme
here
is
that
this
truly
is
not
a
tax;
it's
really
tied
to
the
criminal
process.
and
if
you
look
down
at
the
next
regulation,
it
talks
about
the
tax
return.
and
the
last
clause
is
"this
return
shall
be
filed
within
72
hours
of
their
arrest.
"
if
you
look
down
at
number
two,
then
there
is
a
tax
assessment
within
30
days.
within
30
days
of
what?
within
30
days
of
the
72
hours
after
arrest.
if
you
look
down
at
number
three,
quote:
at
the
time
of
arrest,
law-enforcement
personnel
shall
complete
the
dangerous
drug
informational
reports,
information
reports.
if
you
look
over
on
the
next
page
it
talks
about
"the
law-enforcement
officer
shall
certify
and
submit
the
form
to
the
department
within
72
hours
of
the
arrest.
"
if
you
look
down
at
number
five,
it
talks
about
the
form
and
it
talks
about
information
on
it,
arrest
and
booking
number.
and
if
you
look
at
the
next
regulation
down
under
subpart
(c)
it
talks,
quote:
the
associated
criminal
nature
of
assessments
under
this
act
is
considered
to
be
cause
for
emergency
issue
of
a
warrant
of
restraint.
those
are
the--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--exactly.
justice
scalia
asked
the
question,
well,
isn't
there
an
inordinate
incidence
of
evasion
of
this
tax?
and
i
think
the
answer
is
quite
the
contrary,
because
how
do
you
evade
the
tax?
when
is
the
tax
even
due?
the
tax
is
not
due
until
30
days
after
the
assessment,
or
the
assessment
is
due
72
hours
after
arrest.
i
think
this
tax
probably
has
the
lowest
evasion
rate
of
any
tax
in
the
state
of
montana.
[laughter]
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes.
and
that
reminds
me
of
one
other
point.
if
you
go
back
to
the
first
page
of
those
regulations,
the
second
regulation,
42.34.102,
it
talks
about
a
return,
but
then
everything
else
in
the
regulation
talks
about
a
report.
well,
the
only
evidence
we
have
in
this
record,
and
the
only
forms
i've
seen
in
connection
with
the
montana
dangerous
drug
tax,
are
the
reports
of
the
law-enforcement
officers.
i
don't
think
the
state
has
a
form
of
a
return.
now,
they
do
for
income
taxes,
they
do
for
property
taxes,
as
you
might
expect,
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
constitute
a
return.
so,
in
fact,
this
tax
is
quite
clearly
implemented
through
the
report
of
the
law-enforcement
officer,
triggered
upon
arrest.
now,
other
indicators--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--well,
i'd
like
to
parse
out
the
question.
first,
the
words
you
used
are
the
major
portion
of
the
measure
is
tax
related,
and
if--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--okay,
if
it's
exclusively
then
we
avoid
that
dual
problem.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
then
going
to
the
record
in
this
case,
in
a
document
of
the
department
of
revenue
i
filed
last
week
and
asked
judicial...
that
judicial
notice
be
taken
of
it.
if
revenue
raising
is
the
purpose...
and,
by
the
way,
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
the
hallmark
of
a
tax
is
its
ability
to
raise
revenue...
this
tax
has
raised
in
6
years
$30,000,
according
to
that
document.
last
year
it
raised
$0.
the
year
before,
$10.
the
year
before
they
had
a
deficit
of
$29,000
and
then
some
positive
sides
before.
so
it...
the
actual
fact
is
it's
not
very
well
calculated
and
hasn't
worked
very
well
to
raise
revenue.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
i
think
those
were
the
gross
receipts
period.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
i
think
they
had
to
pay
some
back.
and
i
know
they
collected
$30,000
some
in
this
case
that
they
probably
had
to
take
out
of
one
account
and
put
in
another,
but
i'm
not
sure.
the
document
refers
to
$29,000
minus,
or
a
negative
factor,
so
they
may
have
had
another
problem.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
it's
my
definition
of
a
good
tax.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
in
any
event,
going
to
another
aspect
of
your
question,
that
is
perhaps
the
state,
if
we
really
want
to
speculate,
was
trying
to
avoid
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
if
you...
if
a
state
really
wants
to
design
a
tax
to
make
it
more
of
a
true
tax,
it
perhaps
can
do
so.
without
advocating
for
minnesota's
or
iowa's
tax,
i
want
to
talk
about
several
features.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
i
don't
want
to
advocate
for
justice
scalia,
but
i
think
maybe
his
point
was
that
once
the
law-enforcement
officers
filed
the
report
and
the
taxpayer
may
or
may
not
sign...
and
in
this
case
they
declined
to
sign,
maybe
his
point
is
they
would...
they
could
avoid,
conceivably,
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
but
a
better
way
to
avoid
it
if
you
want
to
draft
a
tax,
as
they
did
in
minnesota,
is
allow
for
the
purchase
anonymously
of
tax
stamps
and
to
penalize
tax
officials
who
make
the
information
available
to
law
enforcement
on
penalty
of
misdemeanor
criminal
charges
and
dismissal,
and
further
to
immunize
the
use
of
that
information
in
a
criminal
process.
now,
if
you
really--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--i
don't
know
what
their...
what
their
proceeds
are.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
if
we
want
to
talk
about
the
structural
component
of
a
measure
such
as
this
that
might
at
least
come
closer
to
passing
constitutional
muster,
it
would
be
that
kind
of
provision.
certainly
not
the
kind
as
we've
seen
in
montana,
we
have
here.
and
furthermore,
you've
got
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
the
greater
of.
i
mean
the
state
is
arguing
that
this
is
a
proportional
excise
tax,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
other
tax
in
montana
that
says
you
will
taxed
either
at
x
value,
or
the
greater
of
that,
or
a
percentage
of
market
value.
so
it's
not
a
true
excise
tax.
it's
dependant
on
apportionment.
and--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--i'm
not
sure--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--i
don't
recall
saying
that,
your
honor,
but
perhaps
we
did
in
the
reply
brief.
proceeding
to
other
aspects
of
this
tax
that
i
think
indicate
that
it's
directly
tied...
it's
not
a
true
revenue-raising
matter,
it's
directly
tied
to
the
criminal
process.
we
compare
it
to
other
taxes.
the
double-tax
question
was
raised,
but
there
are
no
other
taxes
in
montana
that
we've
been
able
to
locate
on
growing
crops.
and
you
saw,
in
response
to
a
question,
how
difficult
it
was
to
assess
taxes
on
growing
crop.
indeed,
we
went
through
a
protracted
trial
and
the
state
has
now
abandoned
that
issue.
there
is
no
other
tax
on
possession...
possession,
by
the
way,
is
kind
of
a
term
of
the
criminal
law
usually,
but
on
possession
of
wheat
or
grains
or
vegetables.
there's
not
even
a
tax
on
harvested
grains
in
montana.
instead,
the
farmers
are
taxed
on
the
income
received
and
they're
taxed
on
their
property.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--one
could
argue
that
that's
reasonable,
except
there's
no
provision
made,
as
i
see
it,
for
reporting
this
marijuana
tax.
why
would
one
report
it
when,
a,
there's
no
return
form
produced
by
the
state;
and,
b,
it's
not
due
until
a
specified
date,
that
is
arrest;
and,
c,
you're
self-incriminating
yourself,
which
the
state
could
avoid,
but
if
you
report
it
then
it's...
then
you
incriminate
yourself.
so
while
that
argument
could
be
made,
i
think
in
the
whole
range
of
the
incident
and
the
structure
and
application
of
this
tax,
it's
simply,
i
don't
think,
a
very
persuasive
argument,
particularly
when
we
return
to
the
fundamental
principle
we're
talking
about
here;
is
any
aspect
of
this
tax
punitive?
because
they've
already
been
punished
for
the
same
conduct,
and
because
double
jeopardy
forbids
the
punishment
twice
for
the
same
conduct.
and
here
i
think
it's...
just
as
night
follows
day,
this
is
a
criminal
matter.
it's
located
and
it's
closely
associated
with
the
criminal
process,
and
clearly
punitive.
and
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
while
the
state
argues
that
this
court
has
historically
given
great
deference
to
tax
matters,
and
i
think
this
court
generally
has,
that
is
not
true
where
the
tax
measure
may
run
afoul
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
that
is
most
of
their
precedent
deals
with
antiquated
tenth
amendment
types
of
challenges
or
just
general
amorphous
challenges
of
taxes
as
penalties.
now
here
we
have--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--basically.
the
united
states
v.
sanchez
and
the
doremus
case
and
a
number
of
those
cases.
and
here...
this
court
said,
in
a
different
context,
in
1975
in
austin
v.
new
hampshire,
dealing
with
a
tax
of
new
hampshire's
that
fell
in
a
discriminatory
way
against
nonresidents,
and
it
was
a
privileges
and
immunities
clause
case.
and
this
court
said:
"our
review
of
tax
classifications
has
generally
been
concomitantly
narrow
therefore,
to
fit
the
broad
discretion
vested
in
the
state
legislature.
"
but
then
this
court
said:
"when
a
tax
measure
is
challenged
as
an
undue
burden
on
an
activity
granted
special
constitutional
recognition,
however,
the
appropriate
degree
of
inquiry
is
that
necessary
to
protect
the
competing
constitutional
value
from
erosion.
"
implying
heightened
scrutiny,
and
the
court
actually...
this
court
actually
said
that,
saying:
"our
prior
cases
therefore
reflect
an
appropriately
heightened
concern
for
the
integrity
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
by
erecting
a
standard
of
review
substantially
more
rigorous
than
that
applied
to
state
tax
distinctions.
"
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
i
agree
that
that's
a
different
kind
of
review,
but
i
don't
think
the
question
is
is
this
a
tax
or
is
it
not
a
tax.
because
i
concede
that
this
can
be
a
tax.
indeed,
the
state
says
it's
a
tax
and
they
call
it
a
tax,
and
they
try
to
raise
money.
the
question
is
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it's
a
tax,
may
it
also
serve
the
dual
purpose
of
punishment.
and
the
answer,
i
think,
from
the
structure
of
this
legislation
in
montana,
is
quite
clearly
it
can
and
it
does
and
it
has
done
so
in
this
case.
and
therefore
because
we're
dealing
with
a
fundamental
constitutional
right,
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
following
the
analogy
of
austin
v.
new
hampshire,
i
submit
that
there
has
to
be
a
heightened
standard
of
review,
and
there
has
to
be
a
fairly
probing
analysis,
as
we
see
under
halper
even,
consistent
with
the
principle
of
humane
justice
served
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
that's
my
point,
not
that...
generally
you
don't
defer
to
legislative
judgment
on
taxes.
i
think
you
defer
much
less.
you
have
a
heightened
standard
of
scrutiny
when
you
have
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
clashing,
and
here
quite
clearly
you
do.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
it
depends
on
whether
you
have
a
fundamental
right
or
a
suspect
classification.
if
you
do
involve...
yes.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
this
court
has
held
in
numerous
cases
that
you
apply
at
least
a
two-tier
standard
in
equal
protection
clauses.
rational
basis
or
minimal
scrutiny
in
most
cases,
but
where
there's
a
fundamental
right
or
a
suspect
classification
involved,
then
you
apply
heightened
scrutiny.
so
i
would
say
double
jeopardy
is
equivalent
to
the
suspect
classification/fundamental
right
analysis
of
equal
protection,
but
not
generally
so.
in
other
words,
i'm
not
sure
you
can
generalize
about
equal
protection
because
of
that
two-tier
approach
that
this
court
has
taken.
but
clearly
this
court
has
said,
in
benton
v.
maryland
and
since,
that
double
jeopardy
is
a
fundamental
constitutional
right,
and
i
think
halper
reaffirms
that
proposition.
and
so,
following
the
austin
privileges
and
immunities
clause
analysis,
i
think
quite
clearly
warranted
here
is
a
very
careful
scrutiny
of
the
state
tax.
not
that
it's
needed,
because
i
think
you
can
see,
just
trying
to
probe
on
various
aspects
of
attempting
to
enforce
and
impose
this
montana
tax,
that
it
doesn't
pass
even
rational
basis
or
minimal
scrutiny.
now,
the
state
argues
in
that
connection
cases
such
as
the
sanchez
case,
and
i
make
the
very
distinction
because
sanchez,
dealing
with
the
federal
marijuana
tax,
federal
marijuana
transfer
tax,
was
kind
of
an
amorphous
challenge
arguing
simply
that
it's
a
penalty
and
not
a
tax,
but
it
didn't
involve
a
double
jeopardy
issue.
here,
of
course,
we
have
the
clashing
double
jeopardy
value
that
the
court
has
to
preserve.
so
i
think
the
sanchez
case
is
justified
as
a
minimal
scrutiny
kind
of
a
case
because
it
was
an
amorphous
tax
case.
and
in
any
event,
in
that
case
this
court
said
that
the
federal
tax
is
punitive,
or
is
deterrent
in
nature
which
is
the
equivalent
of
punitive.
and
finally
i'll
close
by
simply
pointing
out
apart
from
the--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
--that's
right.
my
point
is
you
didn't
have
the
countervailing
double
jeopardy
clause
problem
because
there
was
no
previous
conviction
in
sanchez.
at
least
there
was
none
that
was
raised.
there
was
not
a
double
jeopardy
issue
raised.
moreover
the
court...
this
court
said
specifically
in
sanchez
that
the
tax
is
not
dependant
on
criminal
prosecution,
and
here
i
think
we
have
a
great
deal
of
difference.
now,
i've
cited
in
a
number
of
places
in
my
brief
the
numerous
cases,
including
cases
of
this
court
and
cases
of
lower
federal
courts
and
the
state
cases,
that
have
basically
held
what
i
think
is
quite
obvious,
and
that
is
these
kinds
of
taxes
on
dangerous
drugs
are...
the
purpose
is,
as
the
utah
supreme
court
said
in
the
sims
case,
quote,
to
punish
and
deter
those
in
possession
of
illegal
drugs.
and
the
seventh
circuit
said
years
ago
about
the
federal
marijuana
tax
is
tovar
v.
jarecki,
quote:
does
anyone
suppose
that
the
government
is
trying
to
raise
revenue
in
either
instance?
is
it
not
perfectly
plain
that
the
government
is
trying...
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
is
take
the
plaintiff's
property
and
turn
him
and
his
family
out
on
the
street
for
not
having
a
license
to
do
something
the
government
did
not
want
him
to
do.
and
there
are
numerous
cases
from
other
state
jurisdictions
to
the
same
point.
so
i
respectfully
submit
that
we
have
a
case
here
where
the
individuals
have
been
punished
first,
then
for
the
same
offense
the
state
is
trying
to
invoke
a
quasi-criminal
process
to
punish
them
a
second
time,
and
the
lower
courts
were
quite
clearly
correct
in
dismissing
because
of
double
jeopardy
problems.
