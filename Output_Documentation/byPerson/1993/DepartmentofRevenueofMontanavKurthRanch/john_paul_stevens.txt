john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
was
illegal
income,
it
would
still--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
way
this
tax
works?
what
is
the
taxable
event?
is
there
an
assessment
date,
a
particular
date
when
they...
when
you
do
it,
or
is
it
always
triggered
to
the
criminal
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
coming
into
possession
of
marijuana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
he
allowed
to
retain
possession
of
the
marijuana
or
does
the
state
take
possession
of
it
when
it
finds
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
couldn't...
obviously
couldn't
tax
it
without
being
aware
of
it,
so
i
suppose
that
as
soon
as
it
has
the
right
to
tax
it
also
has
the
right
to
seize
it.
and
then
is
it
on...
is
it
being
taxed
on
his
prior
possession,
or
is
it
taxing
on
something
that
he
no
longer
owns?
it's
a
little
bit
unusual
to
be
taxing
some...
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
something
that
the
person
is
not
permitted
to
own.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
a
tax
on
the
prior...
the
fact
that
he
previously
owned
the
marijuana.
because
at
the
time
you
levy
it,
you
already
have
the
marijuana,
i
gather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're...
he's
being
taxed
for...
because
of
the
fact
that
he
previously
had
in
his
possession
marijuana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
i
see.
how
do
you
apply
a...
how,
in
theory
at
least,
should
you
apply
a
possession
tax
on
something
which
is
growing
when
the
tax
is
not
keyed
to
a
given
day?
i
mean
every
time
his
plant
comes
up
with
a
few
new
shoots
should...
in
theory,
should
he
file
a
tax
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
state
generate
additional
revenue
by
allowing
it
to...
allowing
him
to
retain
possession
for
a
while
under
supervision--
[laughter]
--so
that
he
wouldn't
dispose
of
it,
and
then
increase
the
taxable
corpus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
strange
tax.
there
are
some
really
nice
questions
here.
i
mean
what
if
the
plant
gets
sick
and
it
dies
down
a
little
bit.
[laughter]
and
then
it
grows
back
up.
is
that
the
original
pound
or
is
that
a
new
pound?
i
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
means
that
in
this
case
if
they
labeled
it
a
penalty
your
case
would
be
just
as
strong.
it
wouldn't
really
make
any
difference
whether
they
call
it
a
tax
or
a
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
to
pass
a
statute
that
says
that
everybody
that's
convicted
of
a
felony
shall,
in
addition
to
whatever
punishment
the
judge
imposes,
1
year
after
his
conviction
pay
a
tax
of
$1,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
class
of
persons
who
are
subject
to
the
tax
is
limited
to
those
who
have
already
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
but
isn't
that
precisely
the
kind
of
class
we
have
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
i'm
really
asking
is
do
you
think
the
state
can
constitutionally
tax
a
class
of
taxpayers
which
is
defined
by
the
fact
that
they
have
all
been
convicted
of
a
particular
crime,
without
running
into
some
kind
of
double
jeopardy
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
want
to...
they
do
it
because
they
want
to
raise
money
and
they
think
this
is
an
easily
defined
class,
we
get
$1,000
a
head
out
of
every
burglar,
we
get
that
money...
and
there
are
a
lot
of
burglars
around,
so
we'll
raise
a
lot
of
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
any
people
pay
this
marijuana
tax
except
people
who
are
convicted
of
possession
of
marijuana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
a
practical
matter,
do
they
find
people
who
are
growing
marijuana
and
they
don't
convict
them
of
the
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you
could
always
do
that
with
my
burglary
tax
too.
you
can
do
all
those
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
have
to
say,
i
don't
see
how,
by
confining
the
people
who
have
to
pay
it,
file
a
return
to
those
who
have
been
arrested,
you've
avoided
any
fifth
amendment
problem.
if
anything,
you've
accentuated
the
fifth
amendment
problem
by
saying
only
people
under
suspicion
or
for
whom
there's
probable
cause
they're
criminals,
they're
the
only
ones
that
have
to
make
any
self-incriminating
statements.
that
avoids
the
fifth
amendment
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
of
these
cases
come
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
first,
montana
against
kurth
presents
the
question
whether
the
imposition
of
a
tax
on
the
possession
of
illegal
drugs
assessed
after
the
state
has
imposed
a
criminal
penalty
for
precisely
the
same
conduct
is
a
form
of
double
jeopardy.
respondents,
the
kurth
family,
owned
a
cattle
ranch
in
montana.
when
they
are
unable
to
meet
their
mortgage
payments,
they
went
into
the
business
of
growing
and
selling
marijuana.
in
due
course,
state
officials
became
aware
of
their
illegal
business,
arrested
them,
seized
and
destroyed
their
illegal
crafts,
and
they
were
convicted
and
sentenced
for
their
criminal
conduct.
in
a
separate
proceeding,
montana
also
sought
to
enforce
its
newly
enacted
dangerous
drug
tax
act.
that
statute
imposes
a
tax
on
the
possession
and
storage
of
dangerous
drugs
by
persons
who
have
already
been
arrested
for
that
conduct.
the
statute
expressly
provides
that
the
tax
has
to
be
collected
only
after
all
state
and
federal
fines
and
forfeitures
have
been
satisfied.
the
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
does
not
arise
unless
and
until
the
taxpayer
has
been
arrested
for
the
criminal
offense
of
possessing
the
drugs.
moreover,
the
tax
is
imposed
on
property
that
the
tax
payer
no
longer
possesses
and
the
rate
of
the
tax
in
part
is
based
on
the
market
value
of
properties
that
cannot
be
illegally
marketed.
in
proceedings
to
collect
the
tax,
the
federal
bankruptcy
court,
the
district
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
all
concluded
that
it
was
an
unconstitutional
attempt
to
impose
a
second
punishment
for
the
offense
for
which
the
kurth
had
already
been
convicted
and
sentenced.
because
the
montana
supreme
court
had
reached
a
different
conclusion,
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
this
drug
tax
is
not
the
kind
of
remedial
sanction
that
may
follow
the
first
punishment
for
a
criminal
offense.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
dissenting
opinions
have
been
filed
by
the
chief
justice,
by
justice
o'connor,
and
by
justice
scalia.
justice
thomas
has
joined
the
opinion
written
by
justice
scalia.
