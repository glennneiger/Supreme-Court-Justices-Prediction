mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
halper
against
the
united
states
this
court
extended
the
double
jeopardy
clause
for
the
first
time
to
civil
measures,
but
the
court
made
clear
that
it
is
not
the
case
that
any
civil
obligation,
including
fines,
money
damages,
attorneys
fees,
court
costs,
all
of
which
can
carry
the
sting
of
punishment,
as
the
court
recognized,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant...
the
court
made
clear
that
it
is
not
the
case
that
any
of
those
things
are
punishments
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
rather,
it's
only
when
a
civil
measure
cannot
be
explained
in
terms
of
a
nonpenal
purpose,
it
is
only
in
that
case
that
it
should
be
seen
or
can
be
seen
as
punishment
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that
the
question
that
the
court
asked
in
halper
is
quite
clear.
there
was
a
civil
penalty
that
was
imposed
in
that
case.
the
court
said...
it
was
labeled
a
penalty.
i
think
there
was
very
little
question
that
one
of
the
things
the
legislature
had
in
mind
was
penalizing
the
people
who
had
submitted
the
false
claims.
but
the
court
said
insofar
as
it
can
be
explained
in
terms
of
a
compensatory
purpose,
we're...
that
doesn't
raise
a
double
jeopardy
problem.
and,
in
fact,
i
believe
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
whether
it
could
be
explained
in
terms
of
a
compensatory
purpose.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
believe...
i
don't
believe
if...
that...
what
the
court
said
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
halper
opinion
was
if
it
bore
a
rational
relationship
to
a
nonpenal
purpose,
then
it
is
not
a
penalty.
and
that
relates
to...
or
it's
not
a
penalty
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
that
relates
to,
i
think,
the
chief
justice's
point
that
he
was
making
in
his
question
before,
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
difference...
i
think
that
there
wouldn't
be...
well,
i
think
this
would
be
the
difference.
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
nonpenal
purpose
that's
served,
they
are
different,
generally
speaking,
with
respect
to
civil
penalties,
which
is
what
was
at
issue
in
halper,
and
with
respect
to
taxes.
the
purpose
of
a
civil
penalty...
one
of
the
purposes
of
a
civil
penalty
is
compensating
the
government
for
costs
that
it
imposes
when
the
activity
is
carried
out.
that's
not
generally
the
purpose
of
a
tax.
in
fact,
if
taxes
were
measured
by
whether
they
compensate
the
government
for
particular...
for
particular
costs
that
the
taxpayer
imposes
on
the
government
or
particular
benefits
that
the
taxpayer
receives
from
the
government...
if
taxes
were
imposed
on
that
basis,
they
all
would
be
seen
to
be
penalties
because
almost
none
of
them
can
be
justified
like
that.
the
question
with
a
tax
is
does
it
have
a
revenue-raising
purpose.
the
state
of
montana
looked
around
and
as
it
said
in
its...
in
the
preamble
to
the
statute
here
and
in
entrusting
its
collection
to
the
department
of
taxation
and
numerous
other
incidents
of
this
tax,
they
saw
an
economic
activity
being
carried
on
within
the
state
and
they
thought
that
that
activity,
although
it
was
illegal,
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
tax
that
in
the
same
way
as
the
state
of
montana
and
other
governments
commonly
tax
other
similar
items.
the
example
we
give
in
our
brief
is
cigarettes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think
it
would...
it
would
be
constitutional
for...
that
would
be...
i
think
that
in
that
case
it
would
be
likely
that
you
would
see
that
as
a
criminal
penalty.
i
don't
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
the
lesson
of
halper
was
the
question
that's
asked...
and
the
reason
why
halper
emphasized
that
it
was
a
case...
it
was
an
unusual
case
and
it
was
a
rare
case,
was
the
analysis
turns
on
the
purpose
that's
underlying
the
statute.
the
purpose
here
was
raising
revenue.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
you
have...
i
think
the
question
is
looking
at
the
purpose
in
each
case.
i
think
where
the
tax...
i'll
answer
the
question--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
where
it's
tied
to
a
certain--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
where
it's
tied
to
a
criminal
conviction,
that
it
would
be
so
close...
and
this
would...
is
really
related
to
maybe
more
the
austin
case
than
the
halper
case.
it's
so
close
to
what
historically
has
been
seen
as
a
criminal
punishment
that
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
state--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
that's
not
true.
the
state...
the
state...
in
the
first
place,
the
state
supreme
court
has
specifically
said
that
a
conviction
is
not
required
for
payment
of
this
tax.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
know.
there
may
be...
it
may
be
the
case
that
there
are
people
they
find
growing
marijuana
that
for
one
reason
or
another
they
don't
think
ought
to
be
prosecuted,
or
they
don't
have
resources
for
prosecuting.
i
don't
really
know
the
decisions
the
state
of
montana
makes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
had
very
little
opportunity
to
put
this
tax
into
effect
because
i
understand
that
once
the
bankruptcy
court
came
out
with
its
decision
in
this
case,
it
stopped
trying
to
enforce
it.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
that
the
crucial
point
is
that
the
state...
the
state
entrusted
its
collection
to
the
department
of
revenue,
earmarked
its
proceeds
for
the
kinds
of
purposes
that
tax
revenues
are
ordinarily
used
in
montana--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
and,
as
i
said,
i
think
in
that
case
where
it
would
be
specifically
tied
to
a
criminal
conviction,
i
think
a
state
would
have
a
very
hard
time
getting
out
from
under
the
historical
understanding
of
that
kind
of
thing
as
punishment.
but
this
court
has...
consistently
recognizes
that
taxes
are
not
ordinarily
seen
as
punishment,
there's
no
general
historical
record
that
they
are,
and
that
taxes
on
illegal
activities
are
permissible.
just
as
someone
selling...
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
just
as
someone
selling
cigarettes
in
montana
is
subject
to
paying
a
state
tax,
so
in
the
same
way
somebody
selling
an
illegal
substance,
the
state
of
montana
looked
around
and
say
that
there
were
people
who
were
gaining
substantial
economic
wealth
within
the
state,
that
it
was
an
industry
that
was
carried
on
in
the
state,
and
that
they
too
should
shoulder
the
burdens
of
paying
state
tax.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
actually,
there
are
really
two
inquiries
we
suggested
in
our
brief.
the
first
is
where
it's
a
tax
of
general
applicability
in
that
it
falls
on
both
legal
and
illegal
activities,
we
don't
think
there
should
have
to
be
any
further
inquiry.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
doesn't
apply
to
this
case.
the
second
principle
is
really
kind
of
a
corollary
to
that,
it's
where
it's
a
tax
that's
similar
in
kind
to
the
kinds
of
taxes
that
are
ordinarily
imposed
on
legal
items,
it
also...
that
confirms
the
legislative
intent
that
this
is
a
revenue-raising
measure.
in
this
case,
under
our
analysis,
the
primary
commercial
product
or
the
primary
product
that
they're
talking
about
is
the
buds.
that's
what
these
people
were
really
selling.
the
tax
was
at
an
80
percent
rate.
that's
actually
not
at
all
far
off
from
the
kinds
of
taxes
that
are
imposed
in
some
jurisdictions
and
the
federal
government
may
be
considering
imposing
on
cigarettes.
and
especially
when
you
keep
in
mind
the
court's
statement
in
halper
that
all
you
really
need
is
a
rational
relation
to
a
nonpenal
purpose,
it
doesn't
have
to
exactly...
you
don't
require
a
court
to
kind
of
look
at
it
penny
by
penny
or--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
believe
in
this
particular
case
the
80
percent
rate
was
on
200
or
250
ounces.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
but
i
view
that,
or
we
view
that
as
an
artifact
of
the
fact
that
this
other
product
was
simply
an
extremely
low
grade,
hardly
viable
commercial
product,
and
got
swept
within
the
minimum
provision
of
the
tax.
the
crucial...
and
the
record
i
think
is
clear
on
this,
that
what
they
were
selling
was
marijuana
buds,
and
it
was
that
commercial
activity
that
the
state
of
montana
chose
to
tax.
now,
there
are
mechanisms
that
the
state
adopted--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
if
you
saw
the
main
focus
of
the
tax
as
that,
i
think
that
would
be
a
high
rate.
i
haven't
looked
around
to
see
whether
there
are
other
taxes
that
one
might
compare
that
with,
but
i
think
that's...
that
is
much
higher.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
if
that's
the
problem...
as
i
said,
i
would
look
at
that
as
kind
of
artifact
of
the
fact
that
the
commercial...
that
there's
a
commercial
product
that
they're
taxing,
and
this
other
extremely
low
quality,
barely...
low
value
product
gets
swept
within
it.
if
that's
the
problem
with
this
tax,
if
the
court
looked
at
it
differently,
that
might
suggest
that
the
state
couldn't
tax
the
low
quality
marijuana
product
quite
the
same
way.
but
i
think
the
crucial
point
in
the
case
is
that
the
buds
were
the
commercial
product
that
the
state
was
trying
to
tax.
thank
you.
