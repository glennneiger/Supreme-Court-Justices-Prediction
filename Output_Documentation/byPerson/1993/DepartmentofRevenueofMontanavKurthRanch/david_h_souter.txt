if
they
were
merged
you
wouldn't
have
a
problem,
i
assume.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
wouldn't
have
this
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
the
reference
to
structure
go
against
you?
isn't
it
a
very
odd
structure
for
a
supposed
tax
to
have
two
different
valuation
provisions
and
say
we'll
pick
the
one
that
brings
in
the
most?
that's
not
the
usual
structure
for
a
tax.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
taxable
event
is
the
accretion
of
a
pound
of
weight
to
his
agricultural
product.
justice
david
h.
souter
each
new
pound.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
in
theory
literally
every
time
a
new
pound
is
added
by
nature's
processes,
he
would
be
taxable
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
if
we
don't
take
that
position,
then
we've
put
ourselves
right
back
in
the
old
problem
of
having
to...
having
to
define
the
principal
character
of
the
tax
again.
i
mean
we've
got
the...
we
would
have
the
same
problem
we
had
with
the
regulatory
revenue
taxes.
different
labels,
but
we'd
have
the
same
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
in
fact,
no
one
could
be
prosecuted
for
not
paying
the
tax
as
long
as
the
return
was
filed
within
72
hours
of
arrest
for
the
possession.
