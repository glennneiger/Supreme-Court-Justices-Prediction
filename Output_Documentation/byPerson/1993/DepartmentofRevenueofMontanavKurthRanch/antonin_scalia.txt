justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
no
sanction
for
failing
to
pay
this
tax.
it's
sort
of
a...
sort
of
a
voluntary
good
faith
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
from
people
who
have
been
growing
marijuana,
you
sort
of
trust
them
to
come
up
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can
put
them
in
jail
if
they
don't,
i
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
van
tricht,
is
it
one
or
the
other?
it
can't
be
a
little
bit
of
both.
i
mean
you
say
it...
we
have
to
decide
whether
it's
a
tax
or
a
punishment.
what
if
it's
a
tax
and
also
a
punishment,
who
wins?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
its
being
a
punishment
exclude
its
being
a
tax
or
its
being
a
tax
exclude
its
being
a
punishment?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
glad
i
don't
have
to
administer
this
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
you
don't
collect
this
tax
on
every
piece
of...
on
the
usual
percent.
i
assume
there's
more
evasion
of
this
tax
than
there
is
of
most
taxes
in
your
state,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
to
get
the
same
net
tax
on
all
the
marijuana,
you...
eight
times
the
ones
you
catch
probably
isn't...
isn't
so
outrageous,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
you
happened
to
catch
him
with.
so
he's
probably
paying
a
very
modest,
reasonable
tax
upon
his
total
marijuana
output.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
it
can
be
mixed.
can
it
be
a
tax
and
a
punishment
both?
and
in
that
case,
what,
the
tax
prevails?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that...
but
that
means
that
if
there
is
any...
to
the...
contrariwise,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
penal
purpose,
it
is
invalid,
and
that
means
it
must
be
totally
nonpenal.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
sin
tax.
they're
all
bad
actors.
nobody's
going
to
complain
about
that
kind
of
a
tax.
we
want
to
discourage
burglary.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goetz,
do...
would
you
have
any
problem
if
this
tax
had
been
imposed
in
the
same
proceeding
as
a
criminal
trial
for
the
unlawful
possession
of
marijuana?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
can
accept
all
of
that
and
still
believe
that
the
major
purpose
of
this
piece
of
legislation
is
to
raise
money.
they
don't
require
people
to
file
before
their
arrest
because
they're
worried
about
the
fifth
amendment
problems
of
that.
they
have
it
at
such
a
high
rate
because
they
know
that
not
many
of
these
marijuana
growers
are
caught,
and
therefore
although
they
would
like
to
impose
a
tax
on
all
the
marijuana,
it's
practically
impossible
and
therefore
they
have
a
very
high
tax
on
the
portion
that
they
do
catch.
all
of
that
is
still
consistent
with
essentially
a
revenue-raising
purpose,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
change
it.
exclusively.
it's
exclusively.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
let's
not
get
into
that
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
said
raised,
you
mean
the
gross
receipts
from
it
discounted
by
the
cost
of
enforcing
it,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
they
have
minus
gross
receipts?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
agree
with
you.
it's
a
bad
tax
if
the
state
is
paying
out
money.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
doing
something
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
they
are
likely
to
report,
and
it
seems
to
me
a
reasonable
judgment
by
the
state
that
marijuana
growers
are
likely
not
to
be
reporting
the
income
they're
making
from
growing
marijuana,
and
therefore
that
crop,
unlike
the
other
crops,
we
will
impose
a
crop
tax
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
reasonable
call.
