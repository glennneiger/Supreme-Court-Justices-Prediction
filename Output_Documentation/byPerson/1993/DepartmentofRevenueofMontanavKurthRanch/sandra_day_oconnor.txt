mr.
van
tricht,
if
the
legislature
in
montana
had
passed
its
law
saying
that
anyone
found
in
possession
of
marijuana,
that
there
will
be
a
civil
sanction
imposed
of
$100
an
ounce,
do
you
think
then
we
would
be
required
to
look
at
the
halper
decision
to
determine
its
validity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
precisely
the
same
thing
is
done,
only
it's
called
a
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
see
how
the
change
of
a
word
could
alter
the
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
calling
it
a
sanction
or
a
tax.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
we
could
ever
view
a
tax
as
a
sanction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
isn't
just
the
use
of
the
word.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
$200
a
pound--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--an
ounce,
what?
