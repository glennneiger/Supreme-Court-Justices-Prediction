justice

and
certainly
the
consultation
process
that
the
federal
power
commission,
now
ferc,
is
supposed
to
engage
in
with
the
state
authorities
before
determining...
before
issuing
the
license
and
before
determining
what
the
proper
flow
is
in
order
to
preserve
fish
habitat
and
so
forth,
that
consultation
process
becomes
rather
superfluous
if
the
state
has
a
trump
card.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
code
number?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
experts
in
the
area
always
use
the
statute
number,
which
makes
those
of
us
who
only
occasionally
visit
the
field
confused.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
a
reduction
in
stream
quantity
would
not
constitute
degradation
unless
by
reason
of
the
reduction
in
water
quantity
the
percentage
of
pollutants
would
go
up
downstream.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
quality
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
certainly
means
antidegradation
insofar
as
the
quality
of
the
water
may
cause
a
degradation
of
the
use,
but
does
it
include
degradation
where
the
quality
of
the
water
is
constant,
or
even
higher?
but
the
volume
of
the
water,
being
lesser,
affects
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course
it
is,
but
does
it
do
so
only
by
regulating
quality?
isn't
that
the
issue...
whether
it
does
so
only
by
regulating
quality,
or
also
by
regulating,
or
permitting
the
state
to
regulate
volume?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
may
be
different
in
that
only
that
violates...
only
by
reducing
the
quality
of
the
water
do
you
violate
the
clean
water
act,
which
is,
after
all,
called
the
clean
water
act
not
the
voluminous
water
act.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
undoubtedly
they
do,
but
the
question
is
whether
antidegradation
means
that
the
quality
of
the
water
shall
not
go
below
the
level
necessary
for
extant
uses,
and
let's
look
again
at
page
121a
of
the
section
that
you
were
quoting
from,
(4)(b),
standard
attained.
it
reads,
"for
waters
identified
under
paragraph
(1)(a),
where
the
quality
of
such
waters.
"
not
the
volume
or
anything
else,
"where
the
quality
of
such
waters
equals
or
exceeds
levels
necessary
to
protect
the
designated
use.
"
yes,
the
quality
has
to
be
enough
to
protect
the
designated
use.
then
it
goes
on,
"any
effluent
limitation",
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
"or
any
water
quality
standard
shall
be
consistent
with
the
antidegradation
policy.
"
which
means
that
that
quality
shall
not
go
any
lower.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
only
sensible
way
to
read
it,
and
all
it
gets
you
is
that
you
can't
fiddle
with
the
water
quality,
not
that
you
can't
fiddle
with
the
water
volume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that's
very
bad,
perhaps,
but
the
point
is
that
the
clean
water
act
doesn't
seek
to
prevent
degradation
from
all
sources,
it
seeks
to
prevent
degradation
of
quality.
it
seeks
to
prevent
uses
going...
or
being
prevented,
or
going
down
to
a
lower
use
by
reason
of
water
quality,
not
by
reason
of
volume.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
act
about
volume.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
change
of
flow
or
circulation
may
also
affect
quality
of
the
water.
if
the
flow
is
reduced
and
pollutants
are
coming
in
from
another
source
in
an
unreduced
quantity,
that
change
in
flow
will
affect
the
quality.
so
also
turbidity,
so
that,
you
know,
the
rate
of
flow
can
affect
the
quality.
there's
nothing
in
that
that's
inconsistent
with
saying
that
the
clean
water
act
deals
with
clean
water
and
not
with
the
volume
of
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
prove
it.
i
mean,
the
standards
have
to
include
the
element
of
use,
because
you
cannot
set
a
quality
standard
without
knowing
what
the
water
is
going
to
be
used
for.
if
it's
going
to
be
used
for
feeding
cattle,
it's
one
thing.
if
it's
going
to
be
used
for
people
swimming,
it's
something
else.
so
the
mere
fact
that
the
statute
says
that
the
state
shall
first
decide
what
it
wants
to
use
the
water
for
and
then
set
the
quality
standards
doesn't
prove
that
the
statute
guarantees
that
whatever
the
state
says
the
water
shall
be
used
for
shall
for
all
purposes
be
protected
even
under
the
federal
power
act,
even
as
against
matters
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
water
quality.
the
mere
fact
that
you're
authorized
and
required
to
select
a
use
for
the
water
doesn't
prove
that
that
use
acquires
federal
protection
from
everything
as
opposed
to
just
deterioration
of
water
quality.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
10(j)
require...
require
them
to
protect
the
fish?
i
mean,
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
don't
necessarily
have
to
agree
with
you
or
with
the
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--about
what
it
takes
to
protect
the
fish.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
must
protect
the
fish,
in
their
own
judgment
at
least,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
disagree
with
it
in
the
sense
of
saying
we
don't
want
these
fish?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can't
do
that,
can
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
escondido
was
referring
to
different
conditions.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
makes
a
big
difference,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it's
not
referring
to
conditions
under
the
clean
water
act
at
all.
it's
referring
to
conditions
imposed
by
the
secretary
for
protection
of
indian
reservations,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
say
at
all
that
the
same
scheme
applies
under
the
clean
water
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
the
way
the
federal
government
decided
uniformly
for
all
these
old
statutes
the
whole
hob...
you
know,
bundle
of
them,
to
require
all
federal
agencies
to
abide
by
state
streamflow
requirements
was
the
clean
water
act.
you
think
that
significant
thing
was
done
so
clearly
by
the
change?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
indirect
way
to
have
such
a
significant
effect
upon
federal
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
you're
speaking
for
ferc
as
well
as
for
the
rest
of
the
federal
government,
is
that
right?
i
mean,
your
views
we
can
take
any
of
those--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
your
argument
has
to
be
a
little
more
than
that.
your
argument
has
to
be
that
criteria
are
the
only
thing
that
count--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
uses
are
just
the
means
of
determining
what
the
criteria
ought
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
concede
that
both
uses
and
criteria
are
independently
in
there,
then
you
lose,
because
you're
not
allowing
this
use
to
continue,
according
to
the
state.
