justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
gets
specific
to
the
problem
that
i
have
with
your
argument
there?
401(a)
refers
to...
just
to
the
need
for
discharges
to
comply
with
a
series
of
sections:
1311,
12,
1316,
and
so
on.
1311(b)(1)(c)
refers
to
limitations
"derived
by
the
states
including
those
necessary
to
meet
water
quality
standards
established
pursuant.
"
--and
i'm
skipping
one
line
here...
"established
pursuant
to
any
state
law
or
regulation
under
authority
preserved
by
section
1370
or
any
other
federal
law.
"
as
i
understand
the
argument
that's
being
made,
it's
this:
that
in
order
for
the
discharge
to
comply,
and
hence
be
entitled
to
a
certificate
from
the
state,
the
discharge
can
in
effect
not
be
created
at
the
expense
of
these
water
quality
standards.
the
water
quality
standards
established
by
the
state
include
certain
upstream
flow
requirements
because
they
believe,
or
they
have
taken
the
position
that
they
are
necessary
to
preserve,
among
other
things,
the
fisheries,
and
therefore
that's
the
reason
that
they
may
object
and
hence
fail
to
certify
the
discharge,
because
the
discharge
is
being
made
at
the
expense
of
the
violation
of
an
upstream
standard
that
this
state
is
entitled
under
this
section,
subsection
(c),
to
establish.
is
that
an
unsound
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
do
you
lose
this
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
unless
we
accept
use
as
being
a
standard
applicable
under
subsection
(c)
and
hence
ultimately
through
401(a)...
401(a)
or
401(d).
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
accept
a
use
designation,
or
i
suppose
if
we
accept
a
nondegradation
requirement
as
being
a
water
quality
standard
sufficient
to
justify
a
certification
limitation,
then
that's
the
end
of
that
argument,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
give
me
the
code
number?
well,
is
it
1370?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr....
go
on,
i'm
sorry.
what
do
you
mean
by
degradation?
is
it
your
position
that...
i
assume
what
you
mean
by
it
is
not
degradation
in
use,
but
degradation
in
quality.
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
use
designation
may
be
considered,
if
it
reduces
the
flow
so
as
to
preclude
a
designated
use,
and
i
realize
you
don't
concede
that
use
designation
may
be
considered,
but
that
would
be
the
consequence
if
we
did
consider
it
for
this
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
textual
basis
for
the
inextricable
link?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if--
--well--
--if
you
start
with...
pardon
me,
i'm
sorry.
let
me...
where
is
that
language
that
you
just
referred
to?
where
in
your
brief?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
how
do
we
know
that
"standard"
means
the
use
designation
as
distinct
from
the
criteria?
justice
david
h.
souter
where's
the
definition
in
any
of
this
of
"standard"
to
make
it
clear
textually
that
"standard"
has
the
breadth
of
meaning
that
you
are
assuming?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
and
where
does
congress
use
the
term
just
as
you
have
used
it,
as
part
of
your
water
quality
standard,
"you've
got
to
include
an
antidegradation
policy
and
a
use
designation?
"
where
is
that
textual
definition?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
telling
me
what
they
have
done.
i'm
asking
you
where
do
i
find
it
in
a
text
somewhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
section
303
do
so
in
a
way
that
makes
it
plain,
in
your
view,
that
water
quality
standard
includes
use
designation
and
antidegradation
policy?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
the
answer
is
no,
it
doesn't
clearly
make--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
as
i
understand
it,
your
answer
to
the
broad
argument
that
this
act
is
concerned
with
quality,
not
quantity,
is
the
answer
that
you
gave
to
me,
and
that
is
that
the
act
in
effect
requires
the
state
and
in
any
event
requires
licensees
to
respect
the
state's
certification
subject
to
limits
for
the
purpose
of
preserving...
of
imposing
state
standards.
the
word
"standard"
is
defined
in
such
way
as
to
make
it
clear
that
it
includes
not
only
criteria,
but
use
designation
and
antidegradation
policy.
use
designation
necessarily...
as
washington
has
implemented
it
may
necessarily
include
upstream
flow,
therefore,
under
the
banner
of
standards,
quantity
is
subject
to
regulation
through
the
state
certification
under
this
act.
is
that
the...
are
those
the
steps?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
way
to
make
sure
you're
right,
you
tell
me,
is
to
look
at
303
and
its
legislative
history,
because
that
will
make
it
clear,
you
tell
me,
that
standards
do
include
the
three
elements
and
not
merely
the
element
of
criteria?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
