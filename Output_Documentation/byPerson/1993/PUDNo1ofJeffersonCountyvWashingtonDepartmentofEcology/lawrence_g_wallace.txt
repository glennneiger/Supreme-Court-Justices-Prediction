mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we...
in
a
sense,
yes,
that
the
statute
says
that
any
condition
imposed
in
the
section
401--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
because
this
court's
decision
in
escondido
points
out
that
whilst
ferc
must
recite
such
a
condition
in
the
license
that
it
issues,
it
can
also
explain
any
basis
it
has
for
disagreeing
with
that
condition,
and
in
a
lengthy
footnote
explain
that
ferc
could
then
take
the
position
in
court
that
that
condition
is
not
a
proper
one
in
light
of
its
statutory
responsibilities
under
the
federal
power
act,
and
i'm
referring
to
footnote
20
on
page...
at
466
u.s.,
page
778.
in
the
escondido
case
which
we
cite
toward
the
end
of
our
brief,
this
court
dealt
with
a
similar
certification
required
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
when
the
hydropower
project
was
to
go
on
an
indian
reservation
and
explained
how
ferc
should
proceed
if
it
disagrees
with
the
substance
of
the
condition,
but
nonetheless
is
required
by
law
to
recite
the
condition.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
make
findings
as
well
with
respect
to
it,
and
probably
the
applicant
would
go
to
court
and
ferc
could
support
the
applicant
in
that
respect.
now,
i
do
want
to
begin
by--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they
are
free
to
argue
what
the
federal
power
act,
with
our
criteria
applicable
thereto,
would
lead
to
as
a
conclusion,
and
if
they
persuade
ferc
that
its
responsibilities
under
the
federal
power
act
are
inconsistent
with
this
condition,
then
a
question
would
be
presented
about
how
to
reconcile
the
two
statutes,
so
that
it's
possible
that
they
could
get
a
judgment
that
ultimately
would
supersede
this
condition,
and
it's
possible
that
it
would
not
ultimately--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--exactly.
they
would
be
precluded
from
arguing
that
this
is
not
a
proper
condition
under
the
clean
water
act,
but
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
caution--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
but
it
said
how--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
other
statutory
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
doesn't
say
that
it
does,
but
it's
a
strong
suggestion
by
analogy,
because
these
are
comparably
conditions
required
to
be
recited
in
the
license.
i
want
to
start
by
cautioning
the
court
about
the
scope
of
the
issue
before
it.
if
petitioners
are
correct
that
section
401
certificates
must
be
constricted
in
the
way
they
espouse,
the
effect
cannot
be
confined
to
hydropower
projects
under
the
federal
power
act
that
are...
and
licenses
that
are
issued
by
ferc,
taking
into
account
that
entire
balancing
process.
section
401
on
its
face
requires
a
certificate
to
be
obtained
by
any
applicant
for
any
federal
license
or
permit
to
conduct
any
activity,
or
construction
or
operation
of
any
facility
which
may
result
in
a
discharge
into
the
navigable
waters.
this
includes
nonhydropower
facilities
that
have
to
be
licensed
by
the
corps
of
engineers,
by
the
secretary
of
interior,
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
many
statutory
schemes
cited
en
passant
in
these
briefs.
however,
they
do
not
contain
the
same
kind
of
balancing
criteria
that
are
spelled
out
in
the
federal
power
act,
and
a
good
example
of
that
is
the
federal
land
policy
and
management
act
which
is
cited
in
petitioner's
reply
brief.
it's
at
43
u.s.c.
1761,
which
authorizes
the
secretaries
of
interior
and
agriculture,
depending
on
which
federal
lands
we're
talking
about,
to
issue
rights
of
way
for
reservoirs,
canals,
ditches,
pipelines,
slurry
and
emulsion
systems,
conveyor
belts
for
timber,
power
lines,
means
of
transportation,
et
cetera.
there
is
a
much
less
precise
statutory
backstop
there--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there's
no
doubt
that
they
have
to
comply...
they
have
to
get
401
certificates.
they
have
to
comply
with
the
clean
water
act.
the
question
is
the
scope
of
what
those
certificates
can
address.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
effect
will
be
there
because
petitioner
admits
that
the
criteria
have
to
be
satisfied.
we're
really
arguing
about
what
is
the
scope
of
the
water
quality
standards
that
can
be
specified
in
these
401
certificates,
and
if
there's
one
thing
that's
conspicuous,
and
conspicuously
relevant
about
the
face
of
the
clean
water
act,
it's
that
water
quality
standards
are
required
to
be
adopted
not
for
their
own
sake,
or
to
satisfy
some
scientist
in
a
laboratory,
but
to
preserve
and
protect
certain
beneficial
uses
of
the
waters
as
well
as
the
public
health.
and
the
beneficial
use
that
is
relevant
here
is
use
as
fish
habitat,
and
that
is
the
use
designated
by
washington,
and
in
interpreting
the
operative
provisions
of
the
act,
we
should
not
lose
sight
of
two
very
simple
but
very
basic
propositions
that
you
cannot
have
fish
habitat
without
fish,
and
second,
that
fish--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--need
water
to
survive.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
a
federal--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--statutory
program,
the
clean
water
act,
and
these
standards
have
been
approved
by
epa.
of
course
there
are
other...
other
agencies
have
responsibilities,
although
they're
not
all
as
specific,
and
we
happen
to
be
dealing
with
a
rather
dramatic
kind
of
fish
habitat
that
practically
any
federal
agency
would
protect,
but
the
clean
water
act
is
not
limited
in
its
protections
just
to
that.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
do
represent
all
of
these
interests
in
the
court.
ferc
is
not
a
signatory
to
this
brief,
but
they've
been
consulted
in
what
we
have
filed
here.
