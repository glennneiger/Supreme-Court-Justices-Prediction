mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
wouldn't
a
decision
as
to
preemption
be
premature
here,
since
the
commission
hasn't
yet
acted
on
the
application
for
a
license?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
commission
is
not
capable,
then,
of
saying
that
the
amount
of
water
set
aside
in
the
certificate
is
not
consistent
with
the
project
we
have
in
mind
and
therefore
we're
going
to
change
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
shapiro?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--oh,
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
a
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
state
regulation--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
not
a
statute,
it's
a
regulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is...
where
is
paragraph
(c)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
it
says,
"water
quality
criteria"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
we
on
the
page?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
(vii)
is
a
subsidiary
part
of
(c)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
shapiro.
general
gregoire.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
general
gregoire,
you
say...
where
is
the
antidegradation
policy,
as
opposed
to
the
general
water
and
use
criteria
classes,
found.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a
statute,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whatever
it
was
that
you
just
referred
to,
the
1987--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
on
the
page
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
capital
b?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
is
now
saying
to
the
states
that
these
standards
can't
be
revised?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
this
is
page
32
and
33
of
the
red
brief?
chief
justice

rehnquist
note
38.
note
38?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
part
of
the
clean
water
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
full
text
of
this...
at
least
the
sentences
set
forth
somewhere
else?
i
mean,
if
this
is
the
key
to
your
argument,
i'm
surprised
it's
only
an
elided
sentence
in
a
footnote.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
state
of
washington
had
no
choice
in
this
case
but
to
do
what
it
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wasn't
something
it
just
opted
to
do
as
within
its
latitude
under
the
federal
scheme,
it
had
to
do
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
gregoire.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
mr.
shapiro
told
us
in
his
part
of
the
argument
that
the
ferc
is
bound
as
to
the
conditions
that
we're
talking
about
now,
and
it
could
not
change
those,
and
he
referred
to
a
case
from
the
d.c.
circuit.
does
the
government
agree
with
that
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say,
in
a
sense
you
agree?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
have
to
go
to
court
and
say,
we
don't
want
this
condition
in
the
license
we're
about
to
issue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
mr.
shapiro,
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
get
started?
do
i
correctly
understand
your
position
to
be
that
even
if
there
never
was
a
federal
power
act
at
all,
that
this
condition
would
nevertheless
violate
the
clean
water
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
