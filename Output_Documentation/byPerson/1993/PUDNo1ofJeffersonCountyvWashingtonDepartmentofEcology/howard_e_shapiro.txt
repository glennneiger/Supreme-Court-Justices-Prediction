mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
it
concerns
streamflow
quantities
for
fish
habitat
at
the
proposed
elkhorn
hydroelectric
project
on
the
dosewallips
river.
the
project
is
subject
to
licensing
under
part
1
of
the
federal
power
act.
streamflow
requirements
determine
the
quantity
of
water
in
cubic
feet
per
second
that
may
be
diverted
by
the
hydroelectric
project,
and
the
quantity
that
must
continue
to
flow
in
the
stream.
now,
the
use
of
streamflow
to
generate
electricity
is
at
the
core
of
the
licensing
scheme
for
hydroelectric
projects
in
part
1
of
the
federal
power
act.
the
question
here
is
whether
streamflow
quantities
at
the
proposed
project
are
to
be
determined
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
under
the
broadly
balanced
public
interest
considerations
in
part
1
of
the
federal
power
act,
or
by
conditions
imposed
in
state
certifications
under
section
401
of
the
federal
clean
water
act.
if
washington
had
attempted
to
impose
the
challenged
streamflow
conditions
independently
of
the
federal
statute,
its
action
would
have
been
preempted
by
the
federal
power
act
under
this
court's
decisions
in
california
v.
ferc,
decided
in
1990,
and
in
first
iowa
hydroelectric
cooperative
v.
fpc,
decided
in
1946.
so
another
way
of
stating
the
question
here
is
whether
section
401
of
the
clean
water
act
shields
a
state's
attempt
to
regulate
streamflow
quantities
at
a
hydroelectric
project
from
preemption
by
part
1
of
the
federal
power
act.
if
the
certification
conditions
in
the
state
section
401
certification
are
outside
of
the
scope
of
section
401,
then
there
is
no
shielding
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
the
reason
is
that
the
process
here
calls
for
the
certification
to
be
issued
as
a
condition
precedent
to
the
issuance
of
a
license.
under
section
401(d)
of
the
clean
water
act,
the
conditions
in
the
certification
become
conditions
in
the
license,
so
that--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
this
point
was
quite
correctly
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington
at
petitioner's
appendix
page
16a,
where
it
pointed
out
the
very
thing
i
have
said,
that
ferc
has
to
comply
with
the
certification
condition
regardless
of
its
legality.
now,
the
case
they
relied
on...
u.s.
department
of
interior
v.
ferc...
was
a
case
that
involved
a
challenge
by
the
state
of
west
virginia
to
licenses
issued
on
the
ohio
river,
and
in
that
case
west
virginia
said
that
the
state
of
washing...
the
state
of
west
virginia
said
that
ferc
was
encroaching
on
its
section
401
conditions.
in
its
decision,
ferc
said
no,
we
cannot
impose
different
conditions,
we
will
comply
with
what
the
state
says
in
its
certification,
and
that
case
was...
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
in
that
case
was
based
upon
an
acceptance
of
the
ferc's
representations
that
it
was
bound.
now,
the
united
states
in
its
amicus
brief
has
suggested
the
possibility
of
a
conflict,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
can
happen
under
the
law
as
it
is
structured,
since
neither
ferc
nor
any
federal
court
can
review
an
initial
section
401
certification.
the
entire
process
has
to
come
up
under
the
federal
statute,
to
be
sure,
but
through
the
state
court
system.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
exactly
right,
and
that
is
really
the
essence
of
our
argument
that
in
effect
we
have
a
kind
of
a
reversal
of
the
preemption
process.
if
a
state
puts
in
a
condition
that's
outside
of
its
401
authority,
that
condition
still
must
be
included
in
the
license.
ferc
cannot
review
it,
and
ferc
never
gets
to
the
point
of
undertaking
its
responsibilities
under
section
10(j)
of
the
federal
power
act.
section
10(j)
was
enacted
in
1946,
and
it
said
that
the
state...
recommendations
of
state
fish
and
wildlife
agencies
as
well
as
federal
fish
and
wildlife
agencies
must
be
accepted
as
the
basis
for
any
conditions
to
protect
fish
and
wildlife
that
the
ferc
includes
in
its
license,
unless
it
makes
very
specific
findings
after
attempting
to
reconcile
its
differences
with
the
state's
or
federal
wildlife
agencies
that
the
conditions
are
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
and
requirements
of
the
federal
power
act.
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
states
can
completely
circumvent
that
process
simply
by
imposing
conditions
in
the
401
certification.
in
fact,
that
happened
in
this
case,
in
a
related
case
as
one
of
the
amici
have
pointed
out
at
some
length.
having...
i
think
we
should
turn
immediately
to
the
language
of
section
401
of
the
act,
because
it's
fairly
forthright.
it
appears
in
petitioner's
appendix
at
page
134a.
there
are
two
things
that
are
quite
apparent
from
that
language.
first,
the
certification
process,
which
is
a
delegation
of
federal
authority
to
the
state,
is
one
that
not
only
makes
the
certification
a
condition
precedent
to
the
federal
license,
but
it
also...
under
section
401,
the
statute
clearly
distinguishes
between
certifications
by
the
states
and
the
licensing
process.
it
doesn't
transfer
the
licensing
process
to
the
state.
thus,
the
fundamental
balancing
process
ferc
is
supposed
to
undertake
remains
in
effect.
now,
the
second...
and
this
is
an
important
point
about
section
401...
is
that
the
state's
delegated
authority
is
limited
by
the
text
to
certifying
whether
any
discharge
from
the
licensed
activity
complies
with
the
applicable
water
quality
provisions
that
are
specifically
enumerated
in
section
401(a).
so
states
aren't
authorized
to
regulate
the
activity
itself...
that
is,
to
regulate
the
hydropower
project.
they
are
to
regulate
discharges
from
the
hydropower
project.
now,
among
the
enumerated
provisions
specifically
listed
is
section
303
of
the
clean
water
act.
section
303
relates
to
water
quality
standards.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
believe
it
is
1313,
your
honor.
we
have
set
it
out
in
the
appendix.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
is
1313
of
33
u.s.
code,
and
you
will
find
the
beginning
at
page
114a.
it's
a
very
long
section,
but
the
section
which
i'm
about
to
turn
to
specifically
is
section
c
on
page
116a
and
117a,
and
what
i
would
say
very
briefly
about
that
is
that
that
defines
what
constitutes
a
water
quality
standard.
a
water
quality
standard,
according
to
section
303(c)(2)
on
page
117a
of
the
petition...
it's
2a...
says
that
"a
revised
or
new
water
quality
standard
shall
consist
of
the
designated
uses.
"
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
page
117a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it's
at
paragraph
2a.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
"when
a
state
revises
or
adopts
a
new
standard,
the
revised
new
standard
must
be
submitted
to
the
epa
for
approval.
"
"that
new
standard,
such
revised
or
new
water
quality
standard
shall
consist
of
the
designated
uses
of
the
navigable
waters
involved,
and
the
water
quality
criteria
for
such
waters
based
upon
such
uses.
"
that
requirement
for
both
a
designation
of
uses
and
water
quality
criteria
to
protect
those
uses
becomes
quite
significant
to
the
first
basis
for
the
holding
of
the
washington
supreme
court.
we
have
contended,
both
in
the
court
below
and
in
this
court,
that
water
quality
standards
applied
in
a
401
certification
are
limited
to
pollution
and
discharges
as
opposed
to
streamflow
levels.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
your
honor
has
stated
quite
correctly
that
the
discharge
must
comply
with
the
state's
water
quality
standards
as
approved
by
epa,
but
the
water
quality
standard
has
two
elements.
it
must
consist
of
the
designated
use,
which
in
this
case
happens
to
include
fish
habitat.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
it
must
also
violate
the
criteria
to
protect
that
use.
in
short,
the
designated
use
alone
is
insufficient.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
certainly
lose
this
aspect
of
the
argument--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--because
then
the
case
becomes
one
in
which
all
that's
necessary
to
make
a
water
quality
standard
is
a
designated
use.
at
that
point
the
phrase
in
the
statute
referring
to
criteria
to
protect
that
use
drops
out
of
the
statute.
it's
as
if
congress
didn't
have
to
enact
it,
they
could
simply
say,
just
designate
a
use
and
do
whatever
you
need
to
protect
that
use.
now,
there's
another
reason,
we
have
argued,
why
the
statute
would
not...
is
not
being
properly
applied
here.
your
honor
mentioned
in
your
hypothetical
a
streamflow
requirement
by
the
state.
now,
in
the
court's
decision
in
ferc
v.
california,
the
court
identified
two
kinds
of
water
allocations,
proprietary
and
nonproprietary.
the
allocation
involved
in
ferc
v.
california
was
a
nonproprietary
allocation
of
water
designed
to...
the
allocation
was
intended
to
preserve
fish
and
wildlife
habitat.
it
was
held
to
be
preempted,
but
that
nonappropriated
allocation
is
still
a
water...
is
still
an
allocation
of
water
quantity.
this
act
does
not,
except
as
expressly
provided,
reach
the
allocation
of
water
quantities,
whether
it's
appropriative
or
nonappropriative.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
either
that--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--not
as
we
read
the
statute,
your
honor.
our
contention
is
that
this
statute,
and
section
1370,
which
your
honor
referred
to
when
you
read
section
301,
that's
section
510
of
the
act,
and
it
expressly
provides
that
water
quality
allocations
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
act.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
believe
it
is
1370,
your
honor.
we
have
reproduced
it
in
our
brief
at...
i'm
sorry
to
refer
you
to
so
many
documents...
at
page
7,
footnote
3.
it's
in
the
blue
brief
at
page
7,
footnote
3,
and
we've
set
out
two
provisions,
section
510,
which
is
33
u.s.c.
1370,
and
section
101(g).
the
history
of
that
water
quality...
water
quantity
exclusion
is
that
when
water
quantity
issues
were
first
raised
in
the
congress,
when
the
first
water
quality
standards
act
was
considered
by
congress
in
1965,
senator
muskie
said
expressly
to
the
western
delegations
who
had
asked
him
on
the
floor
about
it,
he
said
on
the
floor,
this
act
concerns
water
quality,
not
water
quantity.
a
line
was
drawn.
that
line
was
reconfirmed
in
1972,
when
section
510,
which
is
33
u.s.c.
1370,
the
second
paragraph
in
our
footnote
3,
was
enacted,
and
then
section
101(g)
was
added
to
the
act
in
1977
because
of
concerns
that
the
line
was
being
broken.
senator
wallops
proposed
an
amendment
that
would
reconfirm
water
quantity
allocation
is
not
something
that
is
being
federalized
under
this
statute.
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
because
the
statute
requires
state
water
quality
standards
to
meet
epa
requirements...
the
epa
administers
substantial
portions
of
it,
the
corps
of
engineers
administers
substantial
portions
of
it...
the
effect
of
these
provisions
was
to
leave
the
state's
authority
over
water
quality...
water
quantity
allocations
exactly
where
they
would
have
been
had
there
been
no
clean
water
act.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
anti--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--degradation
policy
is
a
part
of
water
quality
standards
under
epa
regulations,
and
there
is
a...
there...
after
many
years,
congress
in
1987
added
an
express
reference
to
the
antidegradation
policy
established
under
this
section.
now,
what
anti...
what
degradation
means
is
that
the
quality
of
the
water
will
be
lowered,
and
in
this
court's
decision
in
arkansas
v.
oklahoma,
the
court
affirmed
a
decision,
or
an
action
of
the
epa
relating
to
the
application
of
the
antidegradation
policy.
the
policy
was
applied
in
a
very
practical
way.
the
state
of
oklahoma
said
that
a
discharge
from
a
facility
in
arkansas
was
going
to
degrade
its
high
quality
waters.
the
epa
applied
a
standard
under
which
it
said
we
have
to
have
parameters
to
measure
that
decline.
they
drew
those
parameters
from
the
criteria
in
oklahoma's
water
quality
standard,
and
that
is
the
measure
of
degradation.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
the
discharge
would
in
some
way
change--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--the
receding
waters
by
either
adding
a
pollutant
or
adding
water
that
was
inconsistent
with
water
quality
criteria.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
if
your
honors
were
convinced
that
use
alone
were
sufficient,
then
our
argument
is
in
serious
trouble.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
the
court
actually
looked
at
the
water
quality
standards
applicable
in
this
case,
and
it's
in
the
red
brief
at
the
appendix,
pages
10a
and
11a,
and
i
apologize
for
the
type
size,
but
they
do
tell
us
more
concretely
what
we're
talking
about
here.
now,
you'll
notice--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--it
is
page
10a
and
11a,
your
honor,
where
the
criteria
are,
but
i
think
we
probably
should
begin
just
for
convenience
at
page
8a,
which
is
where
the
water
quality
standards
for
the
dosewallips
river
are
defined.
the
dosewallips
river
is
a
class
aa
river
in
washington.
it's
an
extraordinary
stream.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
this
is
a
regulation--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--this
is
the
water
quality
standard
approved
by
epa
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
is
a
regulation.
now,
if
we
look
at
the
provisions
we
see
first
that
there
is
in
subparagraph
(b)
characteristic
uses.
those
uses
are
enumerated,
and
they
include
various
provisions
relating
to
fish.
they
also
include
things
like
recreation.
now,
below
that
in
paragraph
(c),
we
begin
the
water
quality...
the
water
quality
criteria.
now,
what
are
those
criteria?
well,
we
have--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--paragraph
(c)
is
near
the
bottom,
your
honor,
about
five
lines
up.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
now,
the
first
few
of
those
criteria
are
really
numeric
physical
measures.
they
refer
to
fecal
coliform
organisms,
dissolved
oxygen,
dissolved
gas,
temperature,
which...
maximum
temperature,
actually...
ph,
the
balance
between
acid
and
alkalinity,
and
turbidity.
we
now
move
with
turbidity
into
something
that
is
a
little
more
of
a
condition
than
a
pollutant.
then
we
have
two
narrative
requirements,
toxic
radioactive,
or
deleterious
material.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
on
the
page
we
are
now
on
9a,
and
we're
down
near
the
bottom
at
(vii).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
one
of
the
enumerated
criteria.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
we
have
a
general
narrative
requirement
for
toxic,
radioactive,
or
deleterious
material
concentrations.
the
emphasis
is
on
material,
and
a
further
one
dealing
with
materials
that
might
offend
senses
of
sight,
smell,
sound,
or
taste.
those
are
the
measures
of
degradation,
and
one
of
the
other
effects
of
these
provisions
is
that
it
isn't
simply
a
laundry
list
of
pollutants.
the
last
narrative
one,
toxic,
radioactive,
or
deleterious
material,
permits
the
state
to
deal
with
things
that
aren't
specifically
listed
if
they
are
toxic,
and
with
that
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
unless
the
court
has
questions.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
state
has
focused
on
the
uses
here,
saying
that
uses
are
the
ultimate
standard.
in
effect,
therefore,
we
don't
need
any
criteria.
the
focus
on
uses
has
a
reason
here.
the
state
admits
at
page
24
of
the
red
brief
that
there
is
no
violation
by
this
project
of
the
criteria.
the
phrase
they
use
is,
it
is
likely
that
there
is
no
violation.
when
the
certificate
was
issued,
the
certificate,
which
is
in
the
record
at
petitioner's
appendix
83,
expressly
says
that
the
streamflow
requirements
are
in
excess
of
those
required
for
water
quality
standards.
when
the
case
was
before
the
pollution
hearing
control
board
on
motion
for
summary
judgment,
that
board
said
that
it
is
clear
that
these
streamflows
are
not
based
on
and
were
not
intended
to
be
supported
by
water
quality
standards.
it
wasn't
until
we
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington
that
we
got
to
antidegradation
policy,
which
came
back
into
the
case
as
a
part
of
the
water
quality
standards.
now,
antidegradation
policy...
it's
all
recognized...
is
established
under
section
303.
that
is
what
the
1987
amendments
refer
to,
the
antidegradation
policy
established
under
this
section.
our
position
is,
quite
simply,
that
if
it's
established
under
section
303,
it
has
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
section
303,
and
those
requirements
are
that
a
water
quality
standard
shall
consist
of
uses
and
criteria,
and
that
in
fact
is
what
we're...
what's
involved
with
here.
the
antidegradation
policy
applied
here
was
the
policy
for
protecting
existing
uses.
that's
set
forth
at
petitioner's
appendix,
page
7a,
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington's
opinion.
protecting
existing
uses
under
epa's
regulations
and
practice
requires
that
there
be
criteria
to
protect
the
existing
uses.
in
short,
you
don't
get
away
from
criteria
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it's
the--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--that's
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
that
is
an
accurate
statement
of
the
state's
position.
our
position
is
that
the
phrase
in
section
303(c)
about
uses
and
criteria
is
conjunctive,
and
congress
didn't
intend
there
to
be
uses
independent
of
criteria,
because
then
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
act.
we
could
take
that
long
administrative
regulation
i
referred
your
honors
to
in
the
red
brief
and
just
throw
out
all
the
criteria.
in
fact,
you
wouldn't
need
most
of
the
clean
water
act.
now,
the
clean
water
act
expressly
says
in
section
101(a)
that
it
is
intended
to
achieve
the
physical,
chemical,
and
biological
integrity
of
water,
but
it
also
says
in
the
second
sentence
of
section
101(a)
that
these
goals
are
to
be
achieved
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
act.
the
implementation
of
that
goal
is
what
the
fight
has
been
about
for
nearly
20
years
in
shaping
the
clean
water
act,
and
therefore
i
suggest
that
the
clean
water
act
has
to
be
read,
particularly
when
you're
dealing
with
the
delegations
to
the
states
in
section
401,
in
accordance
with
the
limitations
that
congress
has
provided,
otherwise
the
act
turns
into
something
absolutely
shapeless.
there
was
a
reference
by
the
united
states
to
the
escondido
case.
now,
the
escondido
case
was
a
case
involving
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
interior
or
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
impose
a
condition
on
a
hydroelectric
license
under
the
federal
power
act
if
the
hydroelectric
project
is
located
on
reservations
subject
to
the
control
of
those
officials,
and
the
court
said
that
while
the
condition
had
to
be
included
in
the
license,
the
applicant
or
ferc
could
challenge...
the
condition's
reasonableness
was
subject
to
judicial
review.
but
of
course,
that
is
a
condition
specified
under
the
scheme
of
the
clean
water
act...
under
the
scheme
of
the
federal
power
act.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
thank
you.
