but
mr.
wallace,
isn't
it
true
that
petitioners
at
least
would
be
disabled.
if
they
lose
this
case,
then
aren't
they
bound
by
the
adjudication,
so
that
they
could
not
then
come
before
ferc
and
argue
for
something
less

they
would
be
precluded
with
respect
to
what
the
clean
water
act
means,
but
they
would
be
free
to
argue
that
there's
another
federal...
piece
of
federal
legislation,
that
the
two
federal
acts
are
at
war
with
each
other?
