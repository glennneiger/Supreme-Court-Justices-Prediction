is
a
change
in
temperature
a
degradation
of
the
water?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
page
reference
again,
please?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
would
have
to
set
the
flow
requirement
and
consult
with
the
state,
would
they
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
miss
gregoire,
i
have
one
collateral
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
state
of
washington
under
your
state
constitution
simply
pass
a
law
telling
the
city
to
comply
with
the
state
standard
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no...
no,
my
question,
you
just
have
a
state
law,
and
the
state
law
says
the
city
must
follow
whatever
standard
we
set
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
this
is
my
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
having
a
hypothetical
statute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
the
state
of
washington
passes,
and
it
says
to
all
of
its
agents,
its
cities,
you
must
comply
with
the
water
standards
we
set
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
state
of
washington
could
do
that
under
its
state
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
certainly
prevent
the
city
from
litigating.
