justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
gregoire,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
ferc
wouldn't
protect
streamflow
in
its
license
review?
it
has
to
consult
with
the
state,
and
if
ferc's
own
test
show
these
problems,
do
we
have
any
reason
to
fear
that
the
federal
government
isn't
going
to
consider
the
state's
interests
and
the
concerns
about
the
fish
and
establish
streamflow
limitations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
you
answer
my
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
ferc
won't
impose
streamflow
limitations
to
protect
the
fish?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
haven't
done
it
because
they
have
to
get
the
conditions
under
the
clean
water
act
first,
don't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
so
of
course
they
haven't
acted
yet.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
here
telling
us,
mr.
wallace--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--are
you
here
telling
us
that
the
federal
government
can't
protect
these
habitats
under
any
and
all
licensing
schemes
that
it
has,
that
it
can't
and
it
won't?
you're
here
representing
the
federal
government,
telling
us
don't
trust
the
feds,
they're
not
going
to
do
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case
is
no.
92-1911,
coming
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
its
public
utility
district
no.
1
of
jefferson
county
against
the
department
of
ecology.
section
401
of
the
clean
water
act
requires
states
to
provide
a
water
quality
certification
before
a
federal
license
can
be
issued
for
any
activity
that
may
result
in
a
discharge
in
the
intrastate
navigable
waters.
the
petitioners
are
city
and
local
utility
district,
want
to
build
a
hydroelectric
project
on
the
dosewallips
river.
the
project
would
reduce
the
water
flow
in
the
relevant
part
of
the
river
to
a
residual
flow
of
between
65
and
155
cubic
feet
per
second.
to
protect
the
river's
fisheries,
the
respondent
state
issued
a
section
401
certification
imposing,
among
other
things,
a
minimum
stream
flow
requirement
of
between
100
and
200
cubic
feet
per
second.
the
washington
supreme
court
affirmed.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
also
affirm.
we
hold
that
washington
state's
minimum
stream
flow
requirement
is
a
permissible
condition
in
our
section
401
certification.
the
state
may
impose
requirements
to
ensure
that
activities
which
may
result
in
a
discharge
into
the
navigable
waters
will
comply
with
state
water
quality
standards.
moreover,
a
state
may
impose
conditions
on
certification
in
so
far
as
necessary
to
enforce
a
designated
use
contained
in
the
state's
water
quality
standard.
the
minimum
stream
flow
is
such
a
requirement
because
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the
designated
use
of
the
river
as
a
fish
habitat.
petitioners'
assertion
that
the
clean
water
act
is
only
concerned
with
water
quality,
not
quantity,
rests
on
an
artificial
distinction
since
a
sufficient
lowering
of
quantity
could
destroy
all
of
the
river's
designated
uses
and
since
the
act
recognizes
that
reduced
stream
flow
can
constitute
water
pollution.
finally,
we
are
unwilling
to
read
implied
limitations
into
section
401
based
on
a
petitioners'
claim
that
a
conflict
exists
between
the
stream
flow
condition
and
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission's
authority
to
license
hydroelectric
projects
under
the
federal
power
act.
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
has
not
yet
acted
on
petitioner's
license
application
and
we
do
not
decide
here
that
issue.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
