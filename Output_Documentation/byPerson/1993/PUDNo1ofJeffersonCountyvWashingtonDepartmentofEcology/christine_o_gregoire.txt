ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
washington
state
can
enforce
its
water
quality,
both
the
criteria
and
the
antidegradation
policy
adopted
consistent
with
epa
mandate
pursuant
to
the
clean
water
act.
what
we
have
here
are
water
quality
standards
adopted
by
the
state
of
washington,
including
three
key
elements:
first,
a
designation
of
the
uses
of
the
water
body,
2)
the
criteria
necessary
to
protect
those
designated
uses,
and
3)
an
antidegradation
policy.
that
antidegradation
policy
is
intended
to
protect
existing
uses,
those,
in
this
case,
of
salmon
and
steelhead.
at
this
proposed
project
is
a
dam
50
feet
wide
which
will
block
the
entire
channel
and
divert,
on
average,
75
percent
of
the
water
down
to
the
powerhouse.
the
central
question
before
this
court
then
is,
can
washington
state
enforce
all
of
its
water
quality
standards
including
its
antidegradation
policy
by
protecting
those
existing
uses
by
setting
a
minimum
instream
flow
or
is
washington
state
limited
only
to
its
criteria
and
the
amount
of
water
that
may
be
in
that
stream
at
the
end
of
the
construction
of
the
project.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
the
antidegradation
policy
of
the
state
of
washington
is
found
in
respondent's
brief
at
5a.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
it
is
a
washington
administrative
code
provision,
173-201-035,
adopted
by
the
state
as
a
result
of
the
mandate
of
epa.
epa
has
said
they
will
approve
water
quality
standards
of
the
state
only
if
they
include
an
antidegradation
policy.
that
policy
there
protects
existing
uses
of
a
stream.
in
this
case
the
existing
uses
are
salmon
and
steelhead.
that
antidegradation
policy
has
been
long
recognized
by
congress.
in
1972,
when
it
put
in
place
what
is
now
the
clean
water
act,
it
specifically
indicated
"restore
and
maintain
the
chemical,
physical,
biological
integrity
of
a
stream.
"
and
when
it
so
stated
"maintain",
it
has
been
long
held
to
have
meant
an
antidegradation
policy.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
your
honor,
very
clearly
epa
has
said
that
antidegradation
policy
is
intended
to
protect
the
existing
use...
here,
salmon
and
steelhead.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
the
two
are
inextricably
linked
in
this
case.
there
is
no
difference
in
petitioner's
claim
that
the
state
of
washington
could
enforce
its
criteria
if
there
was
a
degradation
as
a
result
of
lowering
of
the
temperature
or
dissolved
oxygen
as
a
result
of
that
reduced
flow.
that
is
no
different
than
that
reduced
flow
putting
at
risk
the
salmon
and
steelhead,
the
existing
uses
in
this
stream.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
no
question,
your
honor,
but
the
two
are
inextricably
linked
here.
what
we
have--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--well,
again,
if
you
look
at
1987
amendments
by
congress,
what
they
said
very
clearly
there
in
amending
section
303
of
the
clean
water
act
is
that
they
had
long
meant
"maintain"
to
mean
the
antidegradation
policy,
and
that
any
standards
and
permitting
standards
were
subject
to
and
had
to
be
consistent
with
the
antidegradation
policy.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
with
regard
to
section
303,
your
honor?
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
that
is
found
at
petitioner's
appendix
121a,
wherein
it
states,
"for
waters
where
the
quality
of
such
waters
equal
or
exceed
levels
necessary
to
protect
the
designated
use.
"
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
let
me
grab
it
here,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
your
honor,
(4)(b),
"standard
attained".
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
and
where
it
says
that,
"to
protect
the
designated
use"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
talk
about
effluent
limitation,
it
goes
on
to
talk
about
water
quality
standards,
it
goes
on
to
talk
about
permitting
standards,
and
says,
"they
may
be
revised
only
if
such
revision
is
subject
to
and
consistent
with
the
antidegradation
policy.
"
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
epa...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
well,
if
you--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--again,
if
i
can
talk
about
the
process
here,
congress
mandated
the
partnership
between
the
state
and
epa.
epa
mandates
the
state
to
adopt
as
part
of
their
water
quality
standards
an
antidegradation
policy.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
what
congress
has
said
is
you
have
to
list...
as
petitioner
has
indicated,
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
to
indicate
the
designated
uses
and
the
criteria
to
protect
that.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
i'm
sorry.
well,
in
the
section
mr.
chief
justice
just
mentioned,
subsection
303
specifically
talks
about
the
antidegradation
policy.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
well,
the
clear
legislative
history
of
that
amendment--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--it
doesn't
articulate
it
in
the
way--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--in
which
you
just
said,
your
honor,
but
if
one
looks
at
that
legislative
history,
it
calls
that
antidegradation
policy
literally
the
cornerstone
of
the
clean
water
act.
every
day,
agencies
such
as
department
of
ecology
apply
an
antidegradation
policy
when
submitting
permits
for
various
and
sundry
reasons.
when
they
find
that
their
criteria
are
not
there,
or
insufficient
to
protect
an
existing
use
such
as
salmon
and
steelhead,
then
they
resort
to
the
antidegradation
policy
for
purposes
of
permitting
any
applicant.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
but
your
honor,
what
we
have
here
is
a
water
quality
issue
putting
at
risk
the
uses,
the
existing
uses
in
this
stream.
it
is
no
different
than
the
criteria
applied
in
terms
of
temperature
or
dissolved
oxygen.
the
result
is
the
same.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
your
honor,
if
i
could
refer
you
to
33
u.s.c.
section
304,
it's
found
at
the
state's
brief,
32
to
33,
note
38.
therein
is
a
clear
recognition
by
congress
that
dams
constitute
nonpoint
pollution.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
yes.
there
is
a
clear
recognition
by
congress
that
dams
constitute
and
can
constitute
nonpoint
pollution,
and
that
changes
caused
as
a
result
of
the
construction
of
the
dam
insofar
as
movement,
flow,
or
circulation
of
those
navigable
waters
may
constitute
nonpoint
pollution.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
i
apologize,
your
honor.
the
full
text
i
think
you
will
find,
nonetheless,
makes
clear
the
state's
argument
here
that
nonpoint
pollution
caused
by
dams
resulting
in
a
change
of
flow
or
circulation--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--the
clean
water
act
deals
with
congress'
articulation
of
maintenance
and
restoration
of
the
chemical,
physical,
biological
integrity
of
the
nation's
waters.
what
is
put
at
risk
in
this
case
is
the
biological
integrity
of
the
dosewallips
river
by
putting
at
risk
the
existing
uses
of
salmon
and
steelhead.
epa,
by
its
regulation,
makes
clear
that
in
carrying
out
the
mandate
of
congress
all
states
have
to
adopt
all
three
elements
in
order
to
have
their
water
quality
standards
approved.
designated
uses,
criteria,
and
an
antidegradation
policy,
and
epa
goes
on
in
their
regulations
and
makes
clear
that
at
no
time
is
a
state
allowed
to
use
its
antidegradation
policy
to
reduce
the
quality
of
the
water
such
that
existing
uses
are
put
at
risk.
that
is
this
case.
that
is
what
is
happening
here.
that's
the
risk
to
the
salmon
and
steelhead
in
the
dosewallips
river.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
we
see
no
option
for
the
state
to
carry
out
its
water
quality
standards
mandated
and
approved
by
epa
to
do
anything
other
than
what
it
did
in
this
case.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
yes.
could
i--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
and
the
implementing--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--maybe
i
can
help
in
this
way,
your
honor.
there
is
a
difference
between
designated
uses
and
existing
uses.
what
washington
undertook
in
this
case
was
to
protect
existing
uses.
not
something
it
hopes
to
attain
at
some
time
in
the
future,
but
what
is
currently
in
that
stream.
as
a
matter
of
what
went
on
here,
in
1982,
by
invitation
of
ferc,
the
state
department
of
ecology
and
other
state
and
federal
and
tribal
agencies
together
undertook
a
state-of-the-art
scientific
study
of
this
stream.
they
tested
it.
they
made
three
determinations:
1)
what
are
the
existing
uses
in
that
1.2
mile
reach,
and
what
they
found
were
salmon
and
steelhead.
2)
will
the
project,
as
submitted
by
the
applicant
in
this
case,
put
those
existing
uses
at
risk?
the
answer
was
yes.
those
salmon
and
steelhead,
existing
uses
in
that
stream
today,
would
be
put
at
risk.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
your
honor,
what
the
state
did
here
was
its
very
limited
authority
of
water
quality
and
ensuring
water
quality.
the
ferc
process,
the
process
that
we
talked
earlier
with
mr.
shapiro
about
under
the
electric
consumers
protection
act,
that's
intended
to
look
at
the
entire
project
and
what-all
could
be
put
at
risk.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
i'm
sorry.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
i
can't
answer
your
question
because
they
have
not
yet
done
anything
in
this
case--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--they
do,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
right.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
so
i
don't
know
that
they
would
set
an
instream
flow
to
protect
the
water
quality
of
the
state
of
washington
consistent
with
the
401
certification.
the
united
states
argument
about
whether
this
is
right
is
in
fact
a
question,
one
that
we
submit
technically
is
correct.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
but
they
are
not
required...
they
are
not
required
as
a
result
of
that
10(j)
process
to
set
that
minimum
flow
solely
to
protect
water
quality
standards.
401
of
the
clean
water
act
mandates
as
a
necessary
condition
precedent
to
that
act
that
water
quality
must
be
protected.
that's
what
the
state
undertook
here
to
ensure
its
limited
role
of
protecting
water
quality
was
carried
out.
then
the
ferc
process
would
come
about
in
which
they
would
look
at
much
broader
issues,
not
the
least
of
which
would
be,
should
the
streamflow
be
greater?
should
the
streamflow
be
greater
for
enhancement?
should
there
be
mitigation?
those
all
issues
will
come
up
in
the
10(j)
process
with
ferc,
but
it
must
defer
to
the
state's
401
water
quality
certification
with
regard
to
the
minimum
necessary
to
protect
water
quality.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
yes.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
well,
not
necessarily.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
they
do
a
balancing
there,
and
they...
it
is
required
under
10(j)--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--that
if
they
disagree
with
whatever
the
federal
and
state
fisheries
&
wildlife
departments
may
recommend,
they
have
to
state
why.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
no.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
if
they
disagree
in
that
they
have
balanced
the
need
of
consumer
electrical
power,
et
cetera,
against
the
need
for
the
protection
of
the
fish,
but
that...
that
balancing
act...
that
balancing
act
comes
after
the
system
that
congress
has
put
in
place
in
the
clean
water
act
which
says,
under
no
circumstances
will
we
allow
the
degradation
of
the
water
quality.
that
is
the
limited
role
of
the
state
here.
that's
all
it
did.
the
ferc
process
is
much
greater...
much
greater.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
our
position
would
be
no.
the
only
way
in
which
this
water
quality
standard
was
set--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--no,
not
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
your
honor--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
all
right.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
they
can...
yes,
they
can
do
that.
that
is
the--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--it
could
do
that,
but
that
would
not
necessarily
answer
the
question
here
as
to
whether
it's
a
water
quality
decision
under
401.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
