harry
a.
blackmun
well,
certainly
these...
these
particular
plaintiffs
present
rather
appealing
cases,
don't
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
courts
always
dramatize
facts,
i
suppose.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
wellington,
i
take
it...
i'm
going
back
to
the
facts
of
these
cases...
i
take
it
you're
not
disputing
the
facts
of
these
cases?
such
as
conrail's
disciplining
mr.
gottshall
for
administering
cpr?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--is
there
a
difference
between
criticism
and
reprimand
by
a
supervisor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
what
the
legal
question
is.
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
you
concede
these
facts
as
stated.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
how
would
they
be
otherwise?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
i'm
speaking
of
the
other
one,
though.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
okay.
so,
you
don't
have
to
assume.
