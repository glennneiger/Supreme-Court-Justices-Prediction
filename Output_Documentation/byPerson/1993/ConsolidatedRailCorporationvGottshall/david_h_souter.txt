justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
the
original
intent
of
congress
anything,
or
anything
more
definite
at
least,
than
the
removal
of
certain
defenses,
so
as
to
open
up
this
kind
of
litigation?
for
example,
i
mean,
it
removed
the
fellow-servant
defense.
where...
what
can
you
point
to
in
the
intent
of
congress
that,
in
effect,
precludes
this
court
or
the
federal
courts
from
any
exercise
of
originality
in
developing
a
theory
of
liability?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying
that's
what
we
need
to
look
to,
but
my
question
was,
what
is
there,
either
in
the
statute
or...
or
in
legislative
history,
that
you
can
specifically
point
to
that
requires
us
to
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
requires
us
to...
to
foreswear
originality.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that,
in
effect,
it
seems
to
me,
you're
saying
the
third
circuit
was
guilty
of
some
originality.
it
was
supposed
to
take
some
sort
of
a
common
law
census
and
determine
the
common
law
limit,
and
say,
we
cannot
go
one
inch
beyond
that.
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if...
what
if
the
federal
courts
look
at
it
and
say
the...
the
state
courts
are
too
timid?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
depending
on
the
common
law
experience.
it
is
presumably
learning
something
from
it
and
saying,
the
lesson
is
that
we
should
do
a
better
job.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
a
question
justice
kennedy
asked
you
earlier,
and
just
change
the
facts
slightly.
if
mr.
gottshall
had
been
50
years
old
with
a
heart
condition,
would
he
have
been
in
the
zone
of
danger?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the...
does
the
zone
of
danger,
then,
have
to
be
created
by
an
independent
third
party--
justice
david
h.
souter
--independent
of
the
employer?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
it's...
it's
simply...
the
answer
is
it
cannot
result
from
a...
an
existing
condition
of
the
employee
without
the
impingement
of
some
external
force?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
basically,
that
level
is
one
for
the
jury
to
assess?
justice
david
h.
souter
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
common
law
point
of
reference,
isn't
it
american
common
law
that
congress
was
presumably
interested
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
common
law
is
not...
to
use...
it's
not
the
brooding
omnipresence,
it's
the
law
of
a
bunch
of
specific
states,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
farrell,
before
you
go
on
to
the
other
point,
isn't
it
the
case
that
your
opponents
on
the
other
side
are
not
asking
us
to
read
out
the
entire
class
of
injuries.
they
are
simply
saying,
do
not
provide
for
compensation
for
those
injuries
until
certain
other
conditions
have
been
met...
the
conditions
that
are
summarized
by
zone
of
danger
or
whatever
test
might
be
used.
they're
not
asking
this
court
or
any
federal
court
to
read
emotional
injury
totally
out
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
if...
if
it
is
not
read...
i
guess
the
question
should
be,
if
it
is
not
read
totally
out
of
the
statute,
then
how,
even
on
your
premise,
can
we
say
that
we,
in
effect,
are
defying
the
intention
of
congress?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe...
maybe
it's
a
bad
test,
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
is:
if
in
fact
we're
not
reading
the
entire
class
of
emotional
injuries
out
of
the
realm
of
compensation
under
this
statute,
how
can
it
be
said
that
we
are
defying
the
intention
of
congress
to
include
all
injuries?
