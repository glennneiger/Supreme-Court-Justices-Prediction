an
incident
in
which
gottshall
witnessed

the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to

the
third
circuit
reversed.
the
court
noted
that

developed

tests
in

to
limit
recovery
for
emotional
injury,

reasoned
that
these

they

carlisle
sued
conrail
for
emotional
injury
from
work-related
stress.
the
jury
awarded
him
nearly
$400,000
in
damages.
the
third
circuit
affirmed
concluding
that
carlisle
had
produced
sufficient
evidence
that
his
stress-related
injuries
were
genuine
and
had
been
foreseeable
to
conrail.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgments
below.
we
agree
with
the
third
circuit
that
employers
have
a
duty
under
fela
to
avoid
negligently
inflict
emotional
distress
upon
their
employees,
but
we
reject
the
lower
court's
definition
of
the
scope
of
that
duty.
the
third
circuit
disregarded
the
common
law's
treatment
of
the
right
of
recovery
pursued
by
respondents
and
created
a
standard
that
would
in
effect,
make
railroads,
the
insurers
of
the
emotional
well-beings
of
their
employees.
our
case
has
established,
however,
that
fela
is
not
an
insurance
statute
but
a
negligent
statute
and
what
constitutes
negligence
for
the
purposes
of
fela
cannot
be
ascertained
without
reference
to
common
law
principles.
we
adapt
the
common
law
zone
of
danger
test
for
evaluating
claims
for
negligent
infliction
of
emotional
distress
brought
under
fela.
this
test
best
reconciles
without
fela
jurisprudence,
the
concerns
underlying
the
common
law
restrictions
on
emotional
injury
claims
the
potential
for
a
flood
of
trivial
or
fraudulent
suits
and
the
possibility
of
unpredictable
and
unlimited
liability
for
defendants.
under
this
test,
a
railroad
worker
within
the
zone
of
danger
of
physical
impact
due
to
his
employer's
negligence
will
be
able
to
recover
for
emotional
injury
caused
by
fear
of
physical
injury
to
himself.
the
zone
of
danger
test
had
been
adapted
by
a
significant
number
of
states
at
the
time
fela
was
enacted
in
1908,
and
it
currently
is
followed
in
14
jurisdictions.
it,
therefore,
is
a
well-established
common
law
principle
suitable
for
delimiting
the
duty
of
railroads
to
avoid
inflicting
emotional
injuries
upon
their
workers.
we
remand
gottshall's
case
to
the
third
circuit
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
zone
of
danger
test
announced
today.
in
carlisle's
case,
however,
we
remand
with
instructions
to
enter
judgment
for
conrail.
claims
arising
from
work-related
stress
are
not
compensable
under
the
common
law
zone
of
danger
test
nor
are
they
cognizable
under
fela.

souter
has
