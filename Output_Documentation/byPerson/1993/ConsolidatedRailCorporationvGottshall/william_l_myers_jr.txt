mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
today
is
whether
the
court
is
going
to
carve
out
an
emotional
injury
exception
to
the
fela.
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
it
should
not,
first
of
all,
because,
to
do
so,
this
court
would
have
to
essentially
rewrite
the
fela
and,
secondly,
because
there
is
simply
no
need
to
do
so.
this
court
has
already
construed
the
fela
as
a
dynamic
statute
that
is
meant
to
include
causes
of
action
in
specific
injuries
and
specific
classes
of
employees
that
may
not
have
been
originally
contemplated
by
congress.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
the...
this
court
found
in
kernan,
for
example,
kernan
v.
american
dredging,
that
congress
itself
did
not
want
the
fela
to
be
limited
to
the
specific
types
of
injuries
or
the
specific
class
of
employees--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--that's
not
in
the
statute.
and
that's...
and
that's
actually
part
of
our
position.
congress
deliberately
worded
this
statute
in
broad
language.
it
set
up
a
flexible
scheme.
it
didn't
set
out
specific
injuries,
like
accidental
injuries
as
opposed
to
occupational
injuries.
it
didn't
say
that
the
types
of
employees
covered
would
only
be
employees
who
were
traditional
railroad
employees,
rather
than
clerks.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
not
that
it
has
acquired
a
different
meaning,
but
that
some
specific
injuries
are
covered
today,
and
have
been
for
many
years,
that
are
different
from
the
types
of
injuries
congress
was
thinking
about.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
some
injuries
today
are
covered
that
were
not
considered
by
congress.
to
say
that
an
injury
wasn't
covered--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--essentially,
your
honor,
yes.
con...
by
creating
a
dynamic
remedy,
congress
set
up
a
system
where
congress
itself
didn't
have
to
be
aware
of
or
know
all
the
things
that
were
going
to
develop
in
the
future.
congress
deliberately
chose
not
to
create
a
statute
limited
to
the
peculiar
hazards
of
the
railroad
industry.
that
was
this
court's
holding
in,
i
believe,
reed
v.
pennsylvania
railroad.
what
the
petitioner
asks
this
court
to
do,
however--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
we
can...
we
can
say...
that
the
courts
can
say,
as
common
law
courts,
that
causation
is
no
longer
required,
but
the--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
court
could
find
causation
in
situations
where
previously,
because,
for
example,
of
the
lack
of
medical
expertise,
the
courts
were
ill-equipped
to
draw
causation.
and
that's
one
of
the
themes
that's
replete
in
all
these
lower
court
decisions.
at
the
time
the
fela
was
enacted,
juries
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
a
medical
science
that
had
been
developed
to
the
point
where
you
could
draw...
the
medical
people
could
draw
a
causal
link
or
could
discern
a
causal
link
or
a
lack
of
a
causal
link
between
emotional
injuries
and
work
place
conditions.
juries
now
have
the
ability
to
do
that.
they
have
these
medical
experts
who
can
come
in
and
assist
them
on
this
question
of
causality.
which
is
one
of
the
reasons.
i
think,
that
we
don't
need
these
kind
of
arbitrary
hurdles
that
were
enacted
at
common
law
as
ways
to...
to
weed
out
problematic
cases.
medical
science
is
now
the
primary
method
to
weed
out
problematic
cases--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
the
court
has
not
addressed...
has
reserved
that
specific
issue.
i
believe
that
there...
there
is,
in
the
phrasing
of
the
issue,
a
major
difference.
the
petitioner
sees
the
issue
as
whether
this
court
should
create
a
whole
new
duty.
the
respondents
see
the
issue
before
the
court
as
whether,
accepting
the
preexisting
duty
to
provide
a
worker
with
reasonably
safe
working
conditions,
this
court
should
say,
yes
for
physical
injuries
and
no
for
emotional
injuries,
except
under
a
very
limited
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
this
court
has
held
that
the
fela
is
a
preemptive
statute.
for
example,
a
worker
could
not
bring
a
cause
of
action
under
a
state
negligence
statute
if
he
couldn't
meet
the
fela
standard.
similarly,
a
worker--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--to
say
that
the
fela...
yes...
the
answer
is
yes.
if
the
fela
does
not
provide
a
railroad
worker
with
a
cause
of
action,
then
the
preemptive
nature
of
the
fela
would
have
to
mean
that
no
state
could,
as
well.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
i
believe
you
said
as
much
in
the
loss
of
consortium
case,
and
i
don't
remember
the
name
of
it,
where
it
was
held
that...
that
a
wife
could
not
bring
a
state
cause
of
action
for
loss
of
consortium
where
she
had
no
cause
of
action
under
the
fela.
the
next
point
i'd
like
to
make
has
to
do
with
this
whole
issue
of
unlimited
liability.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
respect
of
the
scope
of...
of
the...
in
respect
of
the
relationship
covered
by
the
fela,
the
fela
has
always
been
meant
to
address
the
relationship
between
the
worker
and
the
employer.
that's
what
the
fela
is
designed
to
redress.
the
fela
has
not
been
read
by
this
court
or
by
any
others
to
reach
out
to
someone's
wife
or
someone's
child,
for
example.
and
this
gets
me
to
the...
to
this...
this--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--yes,
i...
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
moves
one
way,
yes.
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
well,
from
the
language--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--well,
the
language
is...
clearly
states
that
any
employee
injured
while
he
is
employed
by
the
railroad
has
a
cause
of
action
so
long
as
the
railroad
is
negligent.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
the
fela
has
been...
what
this
court
has
stated
is
that
the
fela,
as
a
federal
statute,
is
not
bound
by
state
notions
of
common
law.
that
is,
the
federal
courts
are
to
develop
their
own
federal
common
law
in
respect
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
they're
not
bound
by
it,
your
honor,
but
i
think,
in
that
situation,
the
remedial
purpose
of
the
act
would
warrant
that
the
federal
courts
expand
with...
with
the
expansion
of
state
common
law.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
well,
you
start
with
the
premise
that
the
statute
is
a
remedial
statute.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
it's
meant
to
be
remedial
in
the
sense
that
it
is
meant
to
provide
recovery
for
injured
railroad
workers.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
well,
the...
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
i
think,
is
not...
is
not
the
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
i
think
we
should
look
to
this
court's
prior
decisions,
in
kernan
v.
american
dredging--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--yes,
it
did
look
at
the
statute,
and
it
found
in
the
statute
no
basis
to
exclude
certain
causes
of
action
and
to
include
certain
other
causes
of
action.
in
other
words,
the
construction
of
the
act,
as
so
far
given
by
this
court,
as
this
court
is
looking
to
what
congress
intended,
was
that
the
construction
would
broaden,
rather
than
narrow.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
not
just
from
looking
at
the
language--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
the
committee
reports--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--i'm
not...
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
committee
report.
actually,
the...
i
guess
the
best
place
to
start,
really,
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
that's
the
first
place
this
court
has
always
started
in
construing
the
fela.
and
when
it
looks
at
the
fela,
and
when
it
has
looked
at
the
fela
in
the
past,
it
has
always
found
no
limitations
on
the
right
to
recover
from...
from
the
language
of
the
act.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
negligence
is
a
limitation,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
there's
not
going
to
be
a
kind
of
a
free-for-all...
a
person
can't
just
walk
into
court
and
say,
i
don't
like
my
supervisor,
i
have
had
a
headache,
i've
lost
40
pounds.
the
fela
does
require
him
to
prove
negligence.
it
requires
him
to
prove
that
his
employer
failed
to
exercise
due
care
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
that
would
not
be
enough.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
it
would
not
be
enough,
because
it
would
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
negligence.
an
employee
has
to
come
into
court
ready
to
prove
to
a
jury
that
his
employer
failed
to
exercise
due
care,
failed
to
act
like
a
reasonable
employer.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
i
think
quite
the
contrary.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
i
think
quite
the
contrary,
your
honor.
in
working--
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
that
in
any
working
situation,
we're
going
to
expect,
and
a
jury
is
going
to
expect,
there
will
be
unpleasantness.
just
as
there
is
physical
discomfort,
there
may
be
some
level
of
emotional
discomfort.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
that
one
is
for
the
jury
to
assess,
exactly,
based
on
a
case-by...
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
i
think
that
your
honor's
point
is...
is
well
taken,
in
light
of
the
previous
question.
the
federal
statute
isn't
bound
by
state
common
law
for
those
reasons.
additionally,
the
availability
of
the
railway
labor
act
as
an
alternative
mechanism
for
dispute
resolution
would
tend
to
minimize
these
claims,
where
people
would
come
in
to
court
and
try
to
assert
a
claim
that
their...
their
supervisor
annoys
them,
or
their
supervisor
upsets
them.
mr.
william
l.
myers,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
an
analog
statute
that
covers
jones
act
employees,
so
i
cannot
answer
the
question
directly.
the
last
area
that
i'd
like
to
talk
about
and
just
make
one
observation,
which
i
think
is
very
important.
in
his
opening
to
the
court,
the
petitioner
admits
that
the
cases
that
he
is
asking
this
court
to
exclude
from
the
statute
involve
genuine
and
foreseeable
and
severe
injuries,
which...
which
contradicts,
i
think,
to
a
certain
extent,
his
argument
that
allowing
recovery
under
these
cases
is
going
to
result
in
a
flood
of
trivial
lawsuits.
we're
not
talking...
thank
you--
