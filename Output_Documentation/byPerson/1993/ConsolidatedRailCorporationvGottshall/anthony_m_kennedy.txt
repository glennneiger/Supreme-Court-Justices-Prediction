well,
under...
under
your
zone
of
danger
test,
is
there
a
triable
issue
of
fact
in
gottshall?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
he
had
been
rushing
to
help
the
victim
and
broken
his
arm,
i
assume
that
he
would
have
been
covered
because
of
the
rescue
doctrine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
if
the
stress
were
related
to
his
rescue
activities,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
same
result
might
follow.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
all...
in
all
events,
counsel,
workmen's
compensation
statutes
are
not
based
on
negligence.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
undercut
your
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
what
you
are
saying
is
that
this
statute
must
somehow
be
construed
so
that
negligence
in
this
statute
is
parallel
to
workmen's
compensation
standards
for
recovery
in
the
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
what
they...
they
are
arguing
that
there
is
a...
a
duty
for
the
employer
to
use
due
care.
