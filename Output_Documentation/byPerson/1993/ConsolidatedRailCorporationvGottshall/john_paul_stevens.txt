mr.
wellington,
can
i
ask
about
the
language
of
the
statute.
you...
as
i
understand,
you've
conceded
their
injuries
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position
is
there
was
no
negligence
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
there
was
no
violation
of
a
particular
duty
to
these
two
employees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
want
to
be
sure.
well,
and
on
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
duty
that
is
being
argued
is
the
duty
of
the
employer
not
to
avoid
stress
but
to
use
necessary
due
care
to
avoid
unnecessary
stress.
that's
the
duty
that's
being
argued
for,
i
take
it?
