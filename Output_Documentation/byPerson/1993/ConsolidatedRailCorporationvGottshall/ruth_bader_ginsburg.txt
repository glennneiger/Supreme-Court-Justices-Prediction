justice
ruth
bader

mr.
wellington,
in
describing
the
standard
for
the
third
circuit,
whether
it's
correct
or
not,
i'm
not
clear
on
whether
you
are
taking
the
position
that
the
fela
is
frozen
in
a
certain
time
or
whether
this
statute,
which
uses
the
words
"injury",
uses
the
word
"negligence",
whether
this
is
a
charter
to
the
courts
to
use
the
same
kind
of
dynamic
interpretation
in
developing
common
law
concepts
so
that,
with
respect
to
this
act,
the
federal
courts
would
be
in
the
same
position
that
state
courts
are,
and
state
courts,
over
time,
have
changed
the
common
law
with
respect
to
emotional
distress.
is...
are
the
federal
courts
in
the
same
position
vis-a-vis
the
fela,
or
is
there
something
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
we're
going
back
to
the
question
then
that
i
asked,
and
i
think
you're
giving
a
different
answer
now.
i
thought
that
this
statute,
this
general
liability
act,
was
meant
to
be
guidance
for
the
federal
courts
to
interpret
the
law
of
railroad
worker
liability
in
the
way
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
would
interpret
general
liability
statute.
and
i
asked
you
if
there's
any
constraint
based
on
the
date
of
this
act,
or
did
congress
mean
the
federal
courts
to
be
as
dynamic
as
a
state
court
would
be,
so
that
then
the
question
becomes,
what
is
a
sensible
position
for
the
highest
court
of
a
common
law
jurisdiction
to
take?
and
i...
i
still
haven't
got
a
clear
fix,
because
you
seem
to
be
backtracking
now,
on
whether
you're
saying
the
third
circuit
didn't
take
the
sensible
position
for
a
common
law
court
dealing
with
concepts
of
negligence
and
injury
to
be
taking,
or
there
are
additional
constraints
that
the
fela
places
on
the
federal
courts
that
would
not
be
placed
on,
say,
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
in
determining
the
extent
of
liability
for
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
different
test
than
perhaps
as
what
is
floating
around
here...
that
is,
if
you
have
a
physical...
if
there's
a
physical
impact,
then
you
can
recover
for
both
emotional
and
other
kinds
of
injuries,
but
that
the
impact
has
to
be
physical.
which
is
different
from
saying
that
there
are
inevitably
physical
manifestations
of
emotional
distress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
to
that
extent,
the
fela
was
not
dynamic,
if
the
fela
is
limited
to
the...
to
the
injury
to
the
worker,
and
doesn't
cover
derivative
injuries,
the
spouse's?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
i
suppose
it's
sufficiently
dynamic...
i'm
just
looking
at
the
statute...
it
contains
the
word
"widow",
and
husband,
i
suppose,
it
would
be
interpreted
to
be
"widower"
and
wife
of,
today?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
negligence,
that's
a
limitation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
an
analog
to
that
in
the
jones
act,
because,
after
all,
we
do
want
to
keep
the...
the
substantive
rules
consistent.
the
jones
act
just
picks
up
on
the
fela.
so,
to
what
extent
would
the...
would
the
rla
qualify
fela
in...
in
a
way
that
the
jones
act
then
might
be
different?
