chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
92-1956,
consolidated
rail
corporation
v.
gottshall
and
carlisle.
mr.
wellington.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
think
the
duty
to
guard
against
emotional
injury
is
a
more
limited
one
than
the
duty
imposed
by
the
act
to
guard
against
physical
injury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
plaintiffs
met
it
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
when
you're
calculating
damages,
the
damages
are
awarded
for
the
physical
manifestations
really,
are
they
not;
not
for
the...
what
is
claimed
to
be
the
underlying
emotional
upset?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wellington.
mr.
myers,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
myers,
we
reserve
the
question
of
whether
the
fela
covered
emotional
injury
in
the
buell
case,
did
we
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it's...
it's
something
that
obviously
this
court
feels
is...
is
undecided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
myers,
does
the
dynamism
work
both
ways?
if
there
were
a
trend
among
common
law
courts
to
restrict
liability
beyond
what
it
was,
say,
restricted
in
1908,
would
the
fela
move
with
that
trend?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it's
kind
of
a
ratchet?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
we...
how
can
we
tell
that
from
the...
from
the
language
of
the
stature?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
from
the
language.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
supposing
the
common
law
definition
of
negligence
constricts
over
a
period
of
years,
so
that
what
was
once
thought
to
be
negligent
is
no
longer
negligent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
if
that
is
true,
even
though,
let's
suppose
that
the
state
concepts
expand,
the
federal
courts
would
be
free
to
contract.
they're
not
bound
by
what's
happening
in
the
common
law
world,
i
gather.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
understand
that.
i
don't
understand
that
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
does
that
mean?
what
statute
isn't
a
remedial
statute?
every
statute
is
designed
to
remedy
something,
or
presumably
congress
wouldn't
waste
its
time
folling
around
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly.
it
says
that
in
so
many
words.
but
what
more
does
that
tell
us
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
where
do
we
look?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where...
where
did
the
court
in
the
kernan
case
derive
its
interpretation?
it
didn't
look
at
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
do
we
tell
what
congress
intended
again...
from
looking
at
the
language?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
looking
at
committee
reports?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
the
committee
reports
indicate
that
a
broad
range
of
relief
was
intended?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
myers.
mr.
farrell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
workmen's
compensation
case,
but
why
should
it
be
a
negligence
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farrell.
your
time
is...
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wellington,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wellington.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
