mr.
wellington,
why
do
you...
why
do
you
pick
that
as
the
criterion?
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
tests
that
could
be
applied.
for
example,
why
shouldn't
we
adopt
the
rule
that
you
can
recover
for
emotional
injury
only
if
it
manifests
itself
in
some
physical
disability?
you...
you
sort
of
reject
that.
why?
why
is
that,
because
you
don't
need
it
to
win
your
case?
it
seems
to
me,
you've
picked,
among
the
available
common
law
choices
that
various
states
have
used,
the
most
permissive
one
that
will
yet
enable
you
to
win
your
case.
i
don't
know
that
that's
the
way
we
ought
to
decide
this
matter.
there
are
many
more
restrictive
views.
why
shouldn't
we
consider
some
of
those?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
say
that
test
does
apply,
or
it
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
do
they
get
recovery
for
the
physical
manifestations
only,
or
do
they
get
recovery
for
the
emotional--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i
understand.
but,
in
addition
to
that,
do
they...
do
they
get
recovery
for
the
emotional
injury
that
caused
the
physical
manifestation?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes;
well,
why
not
give
them
recovery
only
for
the
physical
manifestations,
for
the
physical
injury
that
they've
suffered?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
that
physical
injury
is
caused
indirectly--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
an
immediate
emotional
injury
which
produces
a
physical
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
wrong
with...
with
doing
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
mean,
it
is
rather
extraordinary.
i'm
not
used
to
being
a
common
law
judge.
i
usually
have
a
statute
in
front
of
me,
and
i
give
it
the
beginning
it
had
when
it
was
enacted.
indeed,
some
of
my
colleagues
look
to
the
committee
reports
and
the
legislative
history
to
see
what
congress
thought
the
meaning
was
at
the
time
it
was
enacted,
and
if
that's
what
they
thought,
that
meaning
doesn't
change,
even
if,
in
light
of,
you
know,
better
knowledge,
we...
it
would
better
have
a
different
meaning.
what
is
different
about
fela
that...
that
converts
us
into
common
law
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
in
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that
some
injuries
are
covered
today
which
clearly
were
not
covered
when
it
was
passed?
that
it's
acquired
a
different
meaning
today?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
different
from
what
i
said?
are
you
or
are
you
not
saying
that
some
injuries
are
covered
today
which
were
not
covered
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
was
covered
when
it
was
passed,
congress
just
didn't
know
it,
is
that
it,
and
the
courts
didn't
know
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we
can
have
different
notions
of
causality
today,
too,
right,
that...
or
are
we
free
to
fiddle
with
that,
as
to
what...
how
proximate
the
causality
has
to
be?
as
common
law
courts,
can
we
change
that
notion
in
the
fela
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
we
can
change
what
causation
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
he
had
a
nagging
supervisor,
that
would
do
it,
right?
the
employer
didn't...
didn't
replace
this
supervisor
who
is
a
little...
he's...
he's
really
too
tough.
that
would
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
a
reasonable
employer
wouldn't...
wouldn't
have...
wouldn't
leave
in
place
a
supervisor
who
is
always
nagging
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
is
too
tough.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
argue
that
to
a
jury?
gee,
i'd
argue
that
to
a
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what...
you
know,
even
if
we
are
developing
a
common
law
rule,
we
are
not,
like
other
common
law
courts,
developing
a
common
law
rule
for
the
totality
of
tort.
rather,
for
this
very
specialized
area;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
area
in
which
you
have
distinctive
types
of
employers,
distinctive
types
of
employees.
they're
generally
not
inclined
to
be
the...
the
shrinking
violets
who
might
suffer
emotional
trauma
from
a...
from
a
severe
boss.
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
railroad
workers.
it's...
it's
also
an
area
where
there
are
other
remedies
that
are
available,
such
as
the
railway
labor
act,
which
are
not
available
in
other...
i
don't...
i
don't...
really
don't
know
what
relevance
general
state
tort
law
has
to
this...
to
developing
a
common
law
rule
for
this
very
specialized
area.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
going
to
ask
that
question.
i
guess
you...
there's
just
a
conflict
on
that,
because,
as
i
recall
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
assertion
is
made
that...
that
emotional
injury
is
generally
not
recoverable.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
workmen's
comp.
justice
antonin
scalia
we...
we
trust
all
of
that,
but...
but
why
isn't...
you're
arguing
to
us
policy
questions...
whether
there
is
too
much
risk
of...
of
runaway
awards,
whether
the
employer
is
going
to
be
excessively
burdened
in
trying
to
keep
a
happy
work
place.
all
of
these
policy
questions
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
congress
usually
resolves
in
this
federal
system.
we
don't
resolve
them.
we
have
a
statute
that
hasn't
covered
this
stuff
in
the
past.
if
congress
wants
it
to
cover
it,
why
can't
congress
amend
it
to
cover
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that...
i...
i
think
that
injury
just
used
to
mean
physical
injury.
in
some
contexts,
it
still
does.
if
you're
filling
out
an
insurance
form,
they
say,
were
there
any
injuries?
you
know,
were
there
any
injuries
from
the...
from
the
automobile
accident?
well,
yes,
my...
my
wife
in
the
seat
next
to
me
was...
was
really
scared
when
we
hit.
i
wouldn't
say
yes,
that
was
an
injury.
it
isn't
an
injury.
it
means
physical
injury,
something
that's...
that's
physically
demonstrable.
