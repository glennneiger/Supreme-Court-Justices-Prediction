well,
is
it
possible,
though,
that
the
common
law
can
change
over
time,
and
that
a
duty
could
evolve,
and
that
perhaps
the
act
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
those
changing
notions?
absolut--
--at
least
there's
some
suggestion
to
that
effect,
i
think,
in
some
of
this
court's
language.

mr.
myers,
regardless
of
how
the
court
comes
out
on
this,
is
there
a
state
cause
of
action
in
addition,
in
a
state
which
would
recognize
an
emotional
injury
negligence
claim?
justice

o'connor
even
if...
even
if
it's
determined
that
the
fela
just
doesn't
cover
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
said
as
much?
