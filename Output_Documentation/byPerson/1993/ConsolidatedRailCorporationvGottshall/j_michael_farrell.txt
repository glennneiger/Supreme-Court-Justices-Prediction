mr.
j.
michael
farrell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
frame
the
issue
just
a
little
bit
differently,
because
i
think
the
issue
that
this
court
is
presented
with
here
is
whether
conrail's
distrust
of
the
twin
pillars
of
the
american
justice
system...
and
that
is
the
jury
and
the
adversarial
system...
should
persuade
this
court
to
ignore
the
text
of
the
fela
and
the
broad
remedial
purposes
as...
as
the
commitments
of
this
court
over
almost
the
last
century
have
revealed,
to
ignore
genuine,
severe
and
foreseeable
injury
resulting
from
the
negligence
of
the
railroad.
let
me,
because
of
the
position
that
i
stand
in,
address
some
questions.
first,
petitioner
said
that
there
was
no
duty
in
1908
to
avoid
emotional
injury
at
common
law.
that's
incorrect.
and
he
ignores
the
case
of
dulieu
v.
white
&
son,
which
is
actually
a
king's
bench
case
in
1901.
i
apologize
i
did
not
cite
it,
and
i
can
provide,
by
letter,
the
cite.
it
was--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
however,
as
i
think
that
we,
as
common
law
lawyers
approach
common
law,
i
believe
the
common
law
would
embody
both...
and...
and
i'll
get
to
your
question
in
a
little
different
way,
contrasting
whether--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--absolutely.
and
let
me
go
right
to...
to
your...
to
the
answer
to
your
question.
and
that's
spade
v.
lynn
and
massachusetts
railroad,
which
was...
which
was
the
american
case
that
was
specifically
addressed
by
just...
judge
kennedy...
excuse
me...
of
the
king's
bench
in
dulieu,
in
which...
in
spade
v....
v.
lynn
and
massachusetts
railroad,
they
recognized
that
there
was
a
duty
to
exercise
reasonable
care
to
avoid
emotional
injury.
but
the
court
said
in
spade,
we
have
a
problem
of
the
administration
of
these
claims...
the
same
argument
that
conrail
is
making
here...
we
have
a
difficulty
of
proof.
and
what
the
resolution
of
the
issue
before
this
court
is,
is
really
a
matter
of
proof.
in
the
carlisle
case,
we
marshalled
a
trial,
and
the
jury
decided
that
conrail
ignored
the
1929
studies
that
revealed
the
dangerous
medical
consequences,
bodily
consequences,
that...
that
occurred
as
a
result
of
unreasonable
stress
on
the
job
without
visual
assistance;
they
ignored
the
1974
report
of
the
fra,
which
confirmed
those
results;
they
ignored
the
1987
assessment
of
the
very
office
that
found
the
conditions
there
hazardous,
that
found
the
staff
inadequate,
that
found
the
work
excessive,
that
found
that
there
was
no
visual
assistance
whatsoever
to
assist
train
dispatchers
who
were
making
moment-to-moment
decisions
that
could
involve
wholesale
catastrophe.
and
that
leads
me--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--good
question,
because
that
brings
me
over
to
justice
o'connor,
who
i
think
asked
a
question,
isn't
there
another
remedy
here?
no,
your
honor.
the
remedy
that...
that
in
fact
the
petitioner
is
arguing
for
before
this
court
is
to
exclude
an
entire
class
of
employees,
an
entire
class
of
injuries,
from
any
remedy
whatsoever.
and
i
might
point
out
that
they
absolutely
misstate
the
law
with
respect
to
workmen's
compensation
in
the
united
states.
the
law
of
workmen's
compensation
in
the
united
states,
every
other
worker
in
any
other
industry
would
have
recovery
for
an
emotional
injury
which
was
foreseeable
and
was
an
essential
consequence
of
their
type
of
job.
but
let's
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
zone
of
danger
that
i
think--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--judge,
i...
i
believe
i've
cited--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--goyden
v....
i
forget
the
defendant's
name...
a
new
jersey
case,
which
essentially
holds
that
if
in
fact
the
emotional
injury
is
causally
related
to
an
essential
aspect
of
that
employee's
work,
that
emotional
injury
is
fully
compensable.
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
that's
why--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--judge...
justice,
let
me
please
comment
on
that.
because,
actually,
if
you
look
at
the
law
of
workmen's
compensation
in
this
area...
for
instance,
the
case
of
hammerle,
which
is
the
pennsylvania
workmen's
compensation
that
recognizes
the
compensability
of
emotional
injury,
the
test
is:
was
the
emotional
illness
a
reasonable
reaction
to
an
abnormal
working
circumstance?
which,
actually,
it
is
the...
the
only
workmen's
compensation
type
of
case
in
pennsylvania
that
actually
requires
proof
of
fault...
proof
of
showing
that
the
condition
was
abnormal.
so,
it's
very
interesting
in
this
area
that
in...
in
the
emotional
recovery
area
in
workmen's
comp,
the
test
does
include
the
reasonable
person
test,
which
is
a
negligence
concept.
and
that
is,
this
is
not
a...
a
subjective
reaction,
it
is
an
objective
test
in
workmen's
compensation.
so,
i...
i
come...
i
cite
the
issue
with
some
hesitancy,
because
of
the
knee-jerk
reaction
of
railroads
generally
to
the
mention
of
workmen's
compensation.
but
i
mention
it
because
of
justice
o'connor's
question,
so
that
this
court
understands
that
what
conrail
is
really
arguing
here
is
that
an
entire
class
of
genuine,
foreseeable,
real
and
severe
injuries
go
completely
uncompensated
in
the
face
of
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
in
1908
that
every
injury
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
negligence
of
the
railroad,
in
whole
or
in
part,
should
be
in
fact
compensated.
and
there's
a
couple
of
other
points
that
i
want
to
make
as
a
matter
of
proof.
this
court
has
recently
addressed
the
issue,
and
actually
reaffirmed
its
faith
and
its
confidence
in
the
american
adversary
system
and
in
the
jury
in
the
case
of
dalbert,
and
also
in
the
case
of...
harris.
but--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--if
i
might
return
to
the
initial
discussion
that
i
had
about
the
dulieu
case,
judge,
i...
justice,
i
believe
that
it
was
in
fact
a
duty
that
existed
at
common
law
that,
at
the
time
of
the
spade
v.
lynn
and
massachusetts
decision,
there
were
these
concerns
about
the
administration...
that
is,
fraudulent
claims
and
unforeseeable
liability
or...
excuse
me...
potential
liability...
caused
the
court
to
adopt
certain
crutches
that
in
fact
were
really
examples
of
meritorious
cases.
we
have
now
developed
medical
science
to
such
a
point...
and
the
adversarial
system
allows
the
medical
science...
the
competing
medical
views
of
the
causation,
of
the
seriousness
of
an
emotional
injury,
under
the
reasonable
man
standard,
to
compete
in
the
marketplace
of
the
courtroom,
and
to
allow
the
jury,
with
proper
instructions,
to
decide
what,
in
fact,
spade
v.
lynn
kind
of
threw
up
its
hands
and
say,
we'll
use
these
crutches,
the
physical
impact
doctrine.
let
me
also
make
a
point--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--let
me...
let
me
make
a
point
under
the
restatement.
i
think
it
was
a
point
that
actually
justice
ginsburg
kind
of
hinted
at.
and
that
is
that,
frankly,
under
the
restatement,
specifically,
313,
if
in
fact
a
reasonable
person
would
foresee
that
their
conduct
would
result
in
emotional
distress
that
would
result
in
bodily
harm,
that
that
is
injury.
our
position,
the
petition
of
the
respondents
in
this
case,
is
that
injury,
as
used
in
the
statute,
means
both
mental
and
physical
injury.
and,
frankly,
as
this
court
said
in
urie,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
would
indicate
an
intention
to
exclude
any
class
of
injuries
or
class
of
employees,
and...
and
any
attempt
to
read
in
such
a
limitation
would
be,
quote,
sheer
inference.
and...
and,
your
honor,
i
think
one
of
the
other
points
that
i
want
to
make
with
respect
to
the...
the
issue
of
the--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--let
me
address
that--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--your
honor,
the
problem
with
zone
of
danger
tests...
and
i
think
it
was
a
question
that...
that
justice
kennedy
asked...
is
that
it
is
so
fortuitous.
if
in
fact
mr.
gottshall--
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
--i
don't
believe
that
we
can.
i
think
the
answer
is
that...
that...
that
your
honors,
obviously,
i
believe,
are...
are
here,
and
i...
i...
with
respect
to
justice
rehnquist,
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question,
i
believe,
theoretically,
that...
that
this
remedy
is
a
dynamic
remedy,
and
this
court,
consistent
with
guidance
from
the
common
law
or
medical
science,
could
contract
the
remedy,
as
well
as...
as
expand
it.
however,
consistent
with
medical
science
as
well
as
the
development
of
common
law...
and
common
law
courts
all
across
this
country,
with
respect
to
recovery
for
emotional
injury,
it
has
been
expanding.
with
respect
to
the
ability
to
identify,
to
measure,
to
scientifically
present
and
defend
the
existence
of
real
emotional
injury,
it
has
expanded.
so,
your
honor,
i...
i
believe
he's
not
writing
it
out
of
the
statute.
i
think
justice
scalia
properly...
he's
picking
the
test
which
is
the
most...
the
broadest
test,
which
allows
him
to
win
in
both
of
these
cases.
but
it
is
completely
fortuitous.
it
is
overinclusive
and
underinclusive
at
the
same
time,
just
as
a
physical
impact
test.
if
you
remember
roscoe
pound,
75
years
ago,
made
the
very
same
point,
that
it's
absolutely
fortuitous...
if
there's
a...
if
there's
a
jostling...
in
the
case
from
pennsylvania,
zelinsky,
an
automobile
passenger
in
an
absolute
bump
in
a
parking
lot,
who
is
jostled,
is
then
able
to
collect
for...
for
a
full
range
of
emotional
injury
because
of
the
magical
coincidence
of
the
cars
having
touched.
and
there...
there
are...
are'a
myriad
of
examples,
justice
kennedy,
using
it
in
the
gottshall
case,
if
in
fact,
mr.
gottshall
had
fallen
on
the
way
to
help,
then
there
would
have
been
the
contemporaneous
physical
injury
and,
magically,
he
would
have
fallen
within
the
test.
i
have
to,
because
i
represent
alan
carlisle,
make
another
point.
the
congressional
history,
the
house
of
representatives,
with
respect
to
the
boiler
inspection
act,
also
indicated
that
their
intention
was
not
only
to
protect
and
place
the
human
overhead
that
the
railroad
consumed
in
its
wake
on
its
employees
on
the
railroad,
it
also
indicated
that
a
purpose
was
to
protect
us,
the
public.
and
this
is
where
alan
carlisle
comes
in.
because
alan
carlisle
is
in
the
operations
aspect
of
a
dynamic
transportation
injury...
industry...
the
movement
of
hazardous
materials
that
involve
catastrophe
that
would,
in
fact,
compromise
entire
communities.
my
client's
stress
was
not
fear
for
himself.
my
client's
stress
was
fear
for
whole
communities;
that
he
was
being
asked
to
make
moment-to-moment
decisions
about
catastrophe
with
inadequate,
outdated
commit...
equipment,
which
was
proven
by
a
government
study
of
the
exact
office
and
the
exact
defendant
at
the
very
same
time,
which
they
ignored.
are
we,
as
a
court,
to
ignore
the
stress
and
inevitable
bodily
consequences
on
an
employee
in
a...
air
traffic
controllers...
that's
the
analogous...
the
analogous
position
that
my
client
would
be
in
if
he
was
in
the
airline
industry.
they
work
20
minutes
and
then...
then
take
a
break.
my
client
worked
15
and
16
hours
a
day,
16
days
in
a
row
under
abusive
supervisors,
with
no
visual
assistance.
and
his
concerns
were
that
he
was
going
to
kill
somebody...
not
only
that
he
was
going
to
kill
somebody,
but
that
he
was
going
to
see
his
face
on
the
front
page
not
of
the
"philadelphia
daily
news",
but
of
the
"london
times",
because
his...
his
mistake
could
compromise
an
entire
community
because
of
the
hazardous
material.
let
me
move
just
a
second
to
my
closing
remarks.
we
cannot
use
18th
and
19th
century
crutches,
such
as
the
physical
impact
rule,
to
resolve
20th
and
21st
century
work
place
problems.
in
dalbert,
this
court...
and
it's
actually
the
test
in
the
third
circuit...
that
the
scientific
validity
of
the
medical
evidence
in
emotional
duress
test
cases,
the
gatekeeping
function
of...
of
the
federal
court
judges
can
in
fact
identify
the
reliability
of
that
validity.
and
if
in
fact
it
meets
that
test,
then
those...
that
expert
testimony,
which
in
both
these
cases,
the
injuries
are
supported
with,
substantiated
by
medical
expert
testimony,
in
my
case,
liability...
that
is,
that
a
reasonable
person
under
the
same
circumstances,
normally
constituted,
would
have
suffered
the
same
or
similar
injuries,
by
dr.
paul
rouech,
who
is
in
fact
a
consultant
for
the
centers
for
disease
control
in
atlanta,
found...
was
the
expert
on
liability
in
the
carlisle
case.
i
am
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
decisions
below,
and
affirm
our
confidence
and
our
commitment,
and
reject,
and
not
be
counseled
by
the
fears
that
conrail
would
like
to
in
fact
share
with
us,
and
affirm
our
belief
in
the
working
ability
of
american
juries
and
of
the
adversary
system
to
find
the
truth
and
to
compensate
the
meritorious
case,
which
was
in
fact
both
the
text
and
the
legislative
history.
mr.
j.
michael
farrell
thank
you
very
much.
