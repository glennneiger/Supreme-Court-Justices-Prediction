mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
two
consolidated
cases
from
the
third
circuit
arise
from
different
factual
circumstances,
but
present
a
single
fundamental
issue
from
their
holdings:
do
railroads
have
a
broad
duty,
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
to
protect
their
employees
from
all
genuine
and
foreseeable
emotional
harm,
even
in
the
absence
of
physical
impact
or
reasonable
fear
of
physical
impact?
this
court,
in
1987,
in
its
decision
in
the
atchison,
topeka
&
santa
fe
v.
buell
case,
discussed
but
did
not
decide
whether
claims
for
emotional
injury
were
cognizable
under
the
fela.
and
since
that
time,
federal
and
state
courts
around
the
country
have
wrestled
with
that
fundamental
question,
and
with
the
legal
principles
to
be
applied
in
answering
it.
although
different
analyses
have
been
applied
by
different
courts,
most...
indeed,
all,
so
far,
until
the
third
circuit,
have
recognized
the
need
to
have
reasonable
limits
on
recovery
for
such
claims
of
emotional
distress.
only
the
third
circuit,
in
the
decisions
below,
has
expressly
rejected
the
experience
of
the
common
law
and
the
limited
tests
of
duty
developed
at
common
law
with
respect
to
emotional
harm.
and
in
its
gottshall
decision,
the
court
determined
that
the
duty
of
railroads
under
the
fela,
and
i
quote
only
a
phrase
from
the
appendix,
page
52
of
the
writ...
appendix
to
the
writ
of
certiorari,
they
held
that
the
duty
under
the
fela,
quote,
includes
a
duty
to
guard
against
conditions
in
the
work
place
that
cause
emotional
harm
to
employees,
end
quote.
this
duty
was
then
applied
in
the
carlisle
decision
to
hold
for
the
first
time
that
railroads
can
be
subjected
to
damages
under
the
fela
for
general
work
place
stress.
we
believe
those
decisions
to
be
error.
at
the
outset,
i
wish
to
make
conrail's
position
on
the
issue
clear.
we
do
not
dispute
that
under
some
circumstances
the
fela
may
provide
recovery
for
some
claims
of
emotional
distress.
in
short,
we
do
not
argue
that
the
word
"injury"
in
the
statute
precludes
recovery
for
all
emotional
harm.
rather,
we
believe
the
critical
inquiry
is
whether
negligence
in
the
statute
imposes
a
general
duty
to
guard
against
conditions
in
the
work
place
that
cause
emotional
harm.
since
there
was
no
independent
duty
for...
at
common
law
at
the
time
the
fela
was
enacted
to
avoid
negligent
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
and
since
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
include
in
the
fela
a
duty
under
negligence
that
was
not
included
at
common
law
at
the
time,
we
believe
that
no
such
general
duty
exists
and
should
not
be
imposed
by
the
courts.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
if...
if
one
looks...
as
this
court
recently,
in
morgan
monessen,
observed,
it's
important
to
look
at
the
historical
context
of
the
fela
and
the
legislative
history
at
the
time.
and
at
the
time
the
fela
was
enacted
in
1908,
there
was
no
general
duty
at
common
law
to
avoid
the
negligent
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
indeed,
there
is
no
such
general
duty
today.
what
the
common
law
has
done
in
the
last
80
years
or
so
is
carve
out
certain
limited
exceptions,
defined
by
zone
of
danger
test,
bystander
test,
that
permit
some
limited
recovery
under
some
circumstances.
and
we
believe
that
if
one
begins
with
looking
at
the
statute
and
its
historical
context,
that
you
cannot
assume
that
congress,
in
1908,
included...
intended
to
impose
a
duty
on
the
railroads
that
was
not
then
recognized
at
common
law
and,
indeed--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--absolutely,
justice
o'connor,
that's
correct.
and
we
recognize
that
this
court
has
interpreted
the
statute
as
evolving
with
common
law.
but
within
the
statutory
framework
originally
enacted,
for
example,
in
the
urie
decision,
where
this
court
real...
held
that
injury
in
the
statute
includes
injury
over
time
from
a
deleterious
substance,
not
just
impact
injury.
that's,
i
think,
an
appropriate
development
with
common
law.
but,
in
morgan,
as
the
court
indicated,
and
as
we
believe
here,
where
there
was
no...
in
fact,
where
the
statute
could
not
have
included
the
duty
at
the
outset,
and
congress
has
chosen
not
to
include
it
through
the
next
80
years
or
so,
we
think
it's
inappropriate
to
include
a
new
duty.
the
third
circuit's
test,
in
fact,
goes
beyond,
your
honor,
anything
that
the
common
law
generally
recognizes.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
appropriate
test
is...
does
reflect
this...
a
response
to
the
remedial
purposes
of
the
fela.
and
that's
the
zone
of
danger
test
that
the
common
law
has
wrestled
with
over
several
decades.
and
at
the
same
time,
in
that
test,
it
does
permit
recovery
for
certain
plaintiffs
under
certain
circumstances,
who
have
sustained
an
emotional
injury.
but
that--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--i
think
that
the
facts,
justice
blackmun,
are
compelling,
particularly,
let's
say,
in
the
gottshall
case.
they
are
dramatized
because
of
the
heart
attack
of
a
co-worker.
the
difficulty,
i
think,
with...
with
the
third
circuit's
opinion,
is
that
in
dramatizing
those
facts...
and
they
are
sympathetic...
i
don't
take
issue
with
the
sympathy
of
the
facts,
particularly
in
the
gottshall
case--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--in...
in...
in
reaching
to
recov...
to
permit
mr.
gottshall
to
recover,
they
have
established
a
rule
of
law
that
has
a
pernicious
potential
application
in
other
cases.
and
the
real
problem
is
exhibited
by
its
application
in
carlisle.
and
it
is
this
general
duty
that
they've
assumed
that
the
railroads
now
have
under
the
fela.
once
you
apply
the
duty...
take
the
duty
from
the
facts
of
carlisle...
excuse
me...
gottshall...
and
apply
it
to
a
carlisle
case,
where
you
immediately
have
a
finding
that
the
duty
includes
a
general
duty
to
avoid
emotional
harm
in
the
work
place,
you
now
have
the
kind
of
unlimited
liability
that
has
never
been
recognized.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
i
do
not
believe
there
is,
justice
kennedy.
the
district
court,
in
fact,
in
gottshall,
in
a...
in
reviewing
the
summary
judgment,
analyzed
mr.
gottshall's
claim
on
a
traditional
zone
of
danger
analysis.
and
it
determined
that
he
was
not
within
a
zone
of
danger.
in
fact,
in
the
third
circuit,
as
the
record
reflects,
mr.
gottshall
argued
that
the
zone
of
danger
was
the
inappropriate
test
to
analyze
his
claim
because
he
recognizes
he's
not
within
the
zone
of
danger.
and
the
third
circuit
did
the
analysis
on
the
common
law
bystander
test,
which
some
courts
recognize.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
interesting
question.
perhaps.
he
would
have
suffered...
if...
yes,
he
may
have,
your
honor.
he
may
have
suf...
if
that
physical
injury
is
a
direct
result
of
the
negligence
of
the
railroad,
and
it
may
be
under
the
law,
based
upon
the
rescue
doctrine.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
if
his
stress
was
related...
the
difficulty
i
have,
your
honor,
is
that
we
have
to...
i
think
it's
appropriate...
important
to
have
a
legal
analysis
that
really
can
be
applied
by
the
courts
in
these
claims.
no
one
has
analyzed
mr.
gottshall's
claim
on
the
rescue
doctrine
to
date,
that's
either
in
district
court
or
the
third
circuit.
and
the
third
circuit's
principles
are
that,
once
you
can
foresee
that
someone
will
be
distressed,
that
person
can
recover.
the
prob--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--your
honor,
they
are
within
the
same
position,
but
only
within
the
confines
of
what
congress
intended
within
the
original
statute.
and
to
that
extent,
the...
the
federal
courts,
in
interpreting
or
expanding
the
fela,
are
somewhat
constrained
by
the
original
intent
of
congress
and
the
legislative
history
that
reflects
that
intent.
and
so--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--what
we...
what
we
need
to
look
to,
justice
souter,
is
what
the
common
law
of
negligence
was
at
the
time
congress
enacted
it.
and,
as
you
say,
congress--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--i
bel...
it
requires
us
to...
to
not
include
emotional
injuries.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
i
do
not
believe
the
court
needs
to
foreswear
originality,
and
we're
not
arguing
that,
your
honor.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that,
yes,
the
common
law...
excuse...
yes,
the
statute
does
evolve
within
the
common
law,
or
gleaning
guidance
from
the
common
law,
as
this
court
has
observed.
but
the
problem
with
the
third
circuit
decision
is
twofold.
it
has
gone
beyond
what
is
generally
accepted
at
common
law,
to
begin
with.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
it
is
not
just
the
common
law
limit,
your
honor.
what
we...
what
we
believe
is
instructive
about
the
common
law
experience
is
that
the
courts,
in
decades
of
the
common
law,
have
dealt
with
these
claims
and
have
realized
the
pitfalls
of
going
to
a
general
foreseeability
standard.
so,
it's
important
to
look
at
that
experience--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--then--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--we
are
also
constrained,
i
believe,
your
honor,
by
looking
at
the
statute
itself,
though.
and
that's,
i
know,
was
your
honor's
original
question.
in...
when
it
was
enacted,
congress,
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
knew
how
to
change
elements
of
the
common
law
if
it
chose.
and,
indeed,
it,
at
initial
enactment,
made
three
modifications
and,
40
years
later,
made
another
modification,
by
statute,
to
change
basic
negligence
principles
that
had
been
enacted
in
the
statute.
but
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted,
and
indeed,
today,
as
i...
as
i've
mentioned,
there
is,
at
the
common
law,
no
general
duty
to
protect
against
emotional
harm.
for
that
duty
to
have...
for
us
to
assume
that
in
1908
congress
intended
that
duty,
without
having
reflected
that
in
the
statute
itself,
when
the
duty
didn't
exist
at
common
law,
or
without
there
being
any
legislative
history
that
reflects
that
emotional
injuries
of
this
nature
were
to
be
covered,
i
think
is...
is
inappropriate.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying...
or...
and
our
position
is
that
both
of
those
things
are
true.
there
are
additional
restraints
that
the
common
law
courts
would
not
have
because
of
the
historical
context,
and
we
need
to
look
at
what
congress
intended,
and
the
fact
that
it
has
not
amended
the
statute
since
that
time.
the
second
issue
that
we
are
proposing
is
exactly
as
your
honor
suggested.
apart
from
that
legislative
constraint
to
begin
with,
the...
the
test
that
they
adopted
is
not
a
rational,
reasonable
or
workable
test.
and
we
can
look
at
the
experience
of
the
common
law
in
order
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
so,
i
am...
we
are
suggesting
that
both
of
those
things
are
what
is
wrong
with
the
third
circuit's
approach.
by
adopting
a
general
foreseeability
statute,
or
standard,
that
they
now
apply
to...
to
the
railroads,
a
number
of
claims
that
have
already
been
dealt
with
in
the...
by
the
circuit
courts
around
the
country
now
become...
now
pose
situations
of
potential
plaintiffs.
it
is
foreseeable...
it's
a
given
that
it
is
foreseeable
on
the
railroad
or
any
other
industry
that
certain
working
conditions
will
cause
people
stress.
already
this...
the
sixth
circuit
has
dealt
with
a
claim
of
discipline...
of
a
person
who
claims
emotional
harm
from
discipline
decisions
against
him.
the
fifth
circuit
has
dealt
with
emotional
claims
arising
from
witnessing
an
accident
to
someone
else.
the
sixth
circuit
has
also
dealt
with
emotional
claims
from
people
not
liking
the
way
a
supervisor
has
treated
them.
and
we've
had
several--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
mr.
gottshall
was
disciplined
for
that.
i
believe
what
the
record
says
is
that
a
supervisor,
the
following
day...
i
think
verbally
reprimanded
him
for
doing
that.
i
don't
believe
he
was
disciplined,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
i
do
not--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--let
us
assume
that
there
is
not,
your
honor.
the
ques...
the
legal
question
becomes,
is
that
damage-provoking
conduct?
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
for
purposes
of
these
arguments,
your
honor,
we
concede
these
facts...
we
do,
indeed.
the
foreseeability
standard
that
we're
most
concerned
about
is
by
the
cases
i
just
mentioned
that
the
circuit
courts
have
dealt
with.
those
plaintiffs
now
become
damage
plaintiffs,
because,
if
their
emotional
distress
was
genuine,
it
is
clearly
foreseeable
in
those
circumstances
that
people
would
be...
will
be
upset
by
management
decisions
there
now
state
a
recoverable
claim
with
the
third
circuit.
the
next
point
that
i
would
like
to
address
is
the
difficulty
with
mr.
carlisle's
claim
and
mr.
gottshall's
claim,
himself...
themselves.
assuming
the
facts
to
be
exactly
as
they
are
in
the
record,
mr.
gottshall--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--the...
mr.
gottshall's
facts,
your
honor,
were
on
a
summary
judgment
basis,
and
i'm
assuming--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--mr.
carlisle?
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
they
are
as
they
are
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
with
the
facts
that
we
have
before
the
court,
mr.
gottshall
does
not,
under
any
common
law
analysis,
state
a
recoverable
claim.
the
district
court
so
found
that,
and
the
third
circuit,
indeed,
in
analyzing
mr.
gottshall's
claim
under
the
generally
accepted
standards,
found
that
he
did
not
have
a
claim.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
your
honor,
no.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
the
zone
of
danger--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--the
zone
of
danger,
under
common
law
analysis,
is
the
immediate
threat
of
a
physical
impact...
an
impact
of
immediate
threat
of
a
physical
impact.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
yes,
it
cannot
result
from
a
working
condition,
whether
that
working
condition
be
heat,
cold,
heavy
lifting,
work,
stress,
because
the
result
is,
if
the
plaintiff
is
permitted
to
recover,
not
because
he's
been
injured
by
that
condition,
but
because
he's...
he's
uncomfortable
or
afraid
or
concerned
about
working
in
that
condition,
you
now
open
up
as
potential
plaintiffs
under
the
standard
anyone
who
encounters
a
working
condition...
a
supervisor,
a
strenuous
activity,
hours...
they
become
damage
plaintiffs
under
the
fela
even
before
they've
had
an
injury.
so,
i
don't
believe
under
any
circumstance
a
working
condition
can
be
the
physical
impact.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
there
are
three...
three
answers,
your
honor.
the...
the
physical
manifestation
test
that
your
honor
just
mentioned,
for
example,
is
not
really
a
test
under
the
common
law,
even
though
the
third
circuit
sort
of
mentioned
it
as
such.
physical
manifestation...
every
claim
for
emotional
harm
has
an
allegation
of
physical
manifestation.
you
cannot
work...
develop
a
workable
legal
principle
on
whether
or
not
a
plaintiff
says,
i
have
insomnia
or
a
headache.
even
in
the
buell
case
this
court
had,
there
was
gastritis.
mr.
carlisle,
although
his
claim
is
really
emotional
distress,
had...
had
sleeplessness.
mr.
gottshall
had
some
physical
manifestation.
every
claim
has
one.
and
at
the
common
law,
that
is
essentially
not
a
test.
what
it
is,
is
the
common
law
requires
that
manifestation
as
a
showing
of
the
genuineness
of
the
injury,
which
is
part
of
the
injury...
proof
of
it.
secondly--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--i
believe
it's...
it's
a
thresh...
i
believe
it's
an
element
of
a
plaintiff's
proof,
even
under
a
zone
of
danger
test,
your
honor.
secondly--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--yes,
your
honor,
they
both
had
physical
manifestations.
under
a
zone
of
danger
test--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--they
get
recovery
for
the
physical
manifestations
if
they
meet--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--if...
if
they
were...
had
a
cognizable
cause
of
action.
and--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--if--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--by...
by
an
emotional
harm?
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
it...
it's
the
same--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--what's
wrong
with
doing
that
is
i
think
the
same
problem
we
have
with
the
decisions,
is
that
you
open
up
people
who
have
not
in
fact
been
physically
injured...
and
the
way
the
statute
was
originally
intended
to
apply...
to...
to
saying
i,
nonetheless,
because
i'm
upset
with
my
supervisor,
i
can't
sleep
and
i've
lost
10
pounds;
i
have
a
damage
claim
for
that.
you
still
expand
the
basic
liability,
because
the--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
not
on
these
claims,
your
honor.
on
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
to
me,
as...
why
not
argue
that...
i
understand
that's
what
he
was
suggesting...
but
not
on
these
claims.
these
claims
go
to
the
jury
for
emotion...
what
is
the
emotional
impact.
and
the
physic...
or
what
is
the
emotional
harm
and
how
much
should
they
recover?
in
addition,
they're
permitted
to
show
damages,
as
well,
or
give
damages,
as
well,
for
the
physical
injuries
that
have
become
manifest.
our
concern...
we
just
don't
believe
you
can
develop...
establish
a
workable
principle
of
law
on
the
amount
of
physical
manifestation
a
plaintiff
alleges
coming
with
emotional
harm,
because
they
all
allege
some
physical
manifestation.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
your
honor,
what
you've
described
is
a
basic
negligence
action,
where
someone
is
hurt.
and
we
have
no
contest
with
that.
if
mr....
if
mr.
johns...
take
out
the
drama
for
a
moment
of
the
gottshall...
of
the
heart
attack,
and
assume
that
mr.
johns
had
been
working
lifting
these
rails,
and
had
hurt
his
back
lifting
the
rails,
instead
of
had
a
heart
attack.
mr.
johns
would
have
had,
presumably,
if
he
could
establish
the
negligence
of
the
railroad
in
having
him
do
this
work,
he
would
have
a
recovery
for
the
physical
injury
itself
and
impact.
what
mr.
gottshall
is
now
saying
is,
because
i
saw
mr.
johns
hurt,
i
am
afraid
that
i
don't
want
to
do
that
heavy
labor,
and
i
don't
want
to...
and
i
have
an
emotional
harm
that
i
will
be
hurt
if
i
have
to
do
that.
and
we
believe
that's
where
the
line
should
be
drawn.
if
i
might,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
is
indeed
a
federal
statute
that
we
are
interpreting.
and
it
is
not
tied
irrevocably
or
immutably
to
the
common
law.
we
have
not
suggested
that.
what
we
must
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
common
law,
however,
has...
does
give
us
the
experience
of
dealing
with
these
claims
over
several
decades.
and
under
no
common
law
test
would
mr.
gottshall
or
mr.
carlisle
recover.
and...
and
the
third
circuit,
recognizing
that
through
its
analysis,
did
away
with
those
prongs
all
on
the
basic
justification
that
the
third...
that
the
fela
is
a
broad
remedial
statute.
but
that
does
not
answer
the
question...
it
is
not
a
justification
for
doing
away
with
that
experience.
nor
is
it
enough
to
say
we'll,
send
everything
to
the
jury.
we
have
no
quarrel
at
all
with
the
jury
system
and
its
importance
in
fela
cases.
but
this
court,
over
its...
over
its
decades,
has
reviewed
a
number
of
cases
and
determined
some
had
appropriate
evidence
to
go
to
a
jury
and
some
did
not.
courts
still
do
that.
the
question
is
not,
let
everything
go
to
a
jury,
they'll
solve
it.
the
question
is,
is
this
a
duty
that
employ...
railroad
employers
now
have
to
protect
their
employees
from
emotional
harm?
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
we...
we
believe
the
duty,
under
the
fela,
is
to
avoid
physical
impact
or
reasonable
threat
of
a
physical
impact--
mr.
ralph
g.
wellington
--due
care,
yes,
that's...
and
even
under
a
worker's
compensation
analysis
that
was
brought
up,
that...
people
are
able
to
recover
for
worker's
compensation
claims
in
different
standards
in
different
states,
but,
essentially,
if
there's
abnormal
stress
and
they
can
show
it's
related
to
the
work
place.
that
really,
fundamentally,
is
where
the
third
circuit
comes.
by
eliminating
any
other
limited
duty,
it
equates
this
foreseeability
with
duty.
and
someone
who
has
emotional
distress
and
it
was
clearly
foreseeable
from
the
work
place
is
now
a
damage
plaintiff.
thank
you
very
much.
