unknown
speaker
mr.
solovy,
you
said
congress
put
these
in
the
act,
but
the
act
really
didn't
apply
to
any
state
unless
the
state
voluntarily
adopted
it,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
congress'
participation
in
it
can
easily
be
called
a
federal
law,
but
i
don't
know
how
the
interstate
act
itself
qualifies
as
a
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
for
this
purpose?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
think
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
we
have
jurisdiction
over
interstate
agreements
and
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
for
purposes
of
habeas
corpus
we
would
be
enforcing
a
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
enforceable,
but
not
necessarily
to
be
enforced.
we
have
discretion
under
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
and
perhaps
real
federal
laws
that
the
states
have
to
observe,
whether
they
like
it
or
not,
may
be
treated
differently
from
voluntary
state
agreements
such
as
this
one.
unknown
speaker
can
a
state
get
out
of
this
interstate
agreement?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
see
how
--
if
a
state
violates
its
own
law,
we
don't
accept
habeas
corpus
because
a
state
can
change
its
law.
so,
also,
it
seems
to
me,
if
a
state
violates
the
interstate
agreement,
we
shouldn't
enforce
it
by
habeas
corpus
because
if
a
state
doesn't
like
it
it
can
simply
pull
out
of
the
agreement
anyway.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solovy,
i
guess
you
concede
there's
no
constitutional
violation
of
the
speedy
trial
clause
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
constitution
was
violated,
the
speedy
trial
clause,
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
answer
the
question?
unknown
speaker
are
you
treating
this,
then,
as
though
--
as
a
counterpart
to
the
speedy
trial
act.
that
is,
there
are
firm
deadlines
in
the
speedy
trial
act
that
don't
necessarily
coincide
with
what
the
constitution
would
require
absent
--
just
by
itself.
unknown
speaker
but,
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
are
equating
it
--
to
the
extent
that
it's
implementing
the
same
purpose
that
the
constitutional
provision
implements,
then
if
you're
dealing
with
a
constitutional
violation,
then
mustn't
you
show
prejudice,
and
where
is
any
prejudice
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
the
kind
of
prejudice
a
violation
of
the
speedy
trial
provision
of
the
constitution
would
be
addressing,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
very
much
like
a
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
not
jurisdictional.
unknown
speaker
but
a
statute
of
limitations
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
defendant
raises.
it
isn't,
quote,
jurisdictional.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solovy,
if
we
had
a
case
on
habeas
review
from
a
decision
in
a
lower
federal
court,
under
the
notion
expressed
in
hill
against
the
united
states,
this
might
not
be
the
kind
of
claim
that
would
survive
on
federal
habeas
review
from
a
federal
court.
we've
required
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice,
a
fundamental
defect.
do
you
think
the
same
principles
should
apply
on
federal
habeas
from
a
state
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
we've
treated,
though,
2254
like
2255.
we've
said
they're
essentially
the
same.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
different
ground
of
distinction.
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
the
same
rules
don't
apply
when
the
case
comes
from
a
state
court
as
from
a
federal
court.
it's
another
thing
to
say
there's
a
procedural
default
in
hill
and
there
wasn't
here.
certainly,
we've
treated
state
court
judgments
in
federal
habeas
just
as
--
with
just
as
much
deference.
in
fact,
we've
gone
out
of
our
way
to
in
the
davis
and
francis
line
of
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
the
text
of
2255
say
the
same
thing
about
coming
from
a
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
an
argument
for
a
different
statute
as
opposed
to
a
different
definition
of
the
terms
which
are
common
to
the
two
sections?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
saying
that
the
federal
prisoner
has
already
had
certain
chances
for
federal
review
that
the
state
prisoner
doesn't,
which
may
be
a
very
good
reason
for
having
different
--
having
a
different
statute
governing
the
two
cases.
but
the
two
statutes
that
we
have
are
textually
identical
on
the
point
that
you're
concerned
with.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
--
why
aren't
you
across
the
street
making
that
argument,
i
guess
is
another
way
to
put
the
question.
unknown
speaker
i
think
justice
souter
means
why
didn't
you
ask
congress
to
amend
the
statute
to
make
a
distinction
between
2255
and
state
habeas.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
--
there
you're
making
an
assumption
that
i
don't
think
is
quite
settled
on
this
record.
it's
true
that
this
petitioner
referred
to
the
120-day
limit,
but
there
was
a
crucial
time
when
he
didn't,
and
usually
you
can't
object
to,
say,
the
failure
to
give
a
charge
unless
you
object
at
the
moment
when
the
judge
could
cure
the
error.
this
petitioner
was
notably
silent
at
the
time
when
the
judge
could
have
cured
the
error
by
setting
the
trial
at
a
somewhat
earlier
date.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solovy,
before
we
leave
this
point,
i
had
thought
--
i
had
thought
we
rejected
the
proposal
that
2255
and
2254
should
be
similarly
interpreted.
i
thought
we
rejected
that
in
withrow.
indeed,
i
thought
it
was
the
basis
for
my
separate
writing
in
withrow,
that
i
thought
we
should
treat
them
the
same,
and
i
thought
the
court
said
we
shouldn't.
unknown
speaker
i'd
be
happy
to
change
that.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
me
to
adhere
to
my
dissent.
you
want
the
majority
to
adhere
to
its
opinion
in
withrow.
unknown
speaker
i
could
be
persuaded
otherwise,
i
suppose--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
we
rejected
that
kind
of
argument,
though,
in
our
cases
dealing
with
collateral
estoppel
and
estoppel
by
judgment.
the
argument
there
was
you
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
once
in
a
federal
court.
and
we
said
no,
if
you're
stopped
by
judgment
in
the
state
court
you
don't
have
a
second
round.
it's
only
an
analogy.
it
wasn't
habeas.
unknown
speaker
supposing
this
case
had
come
from
the
federal
courts
and
was
subject
to
the
hill-davis-timmreck
line
of
reasoning,
and
you
claimed
a
speedy
trial
act
violation,
right;
do
you
think
any
sort
of
a
speedy
trial
act
violation
could
be
raised
in
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
understand
--
if
the
reason
--
the
reasoning
for
the
objection,
for
rejecting
the
objection
would
be
that
it
doesn't
go
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial
and
it
doesn't
go
to
guilt
or
innocence.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
same
thing
here;
that
it
was
some
days
more
than
120
days
doesn't
go
to
guilt
or
innocence
or
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
we're
going
back
to
jurisdiction.
i
suggested
to
you
that
it
was
like
a
statute
of
limitations,
which
was
not
jurisdictional.
you
agreed
it
was
like
a
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
any
time
a
rule
is
phrased
in
terms
of
"must",
it
becomes,
quote,
jurisdictional?
unknown
speaker
can
you
explain
to
me
what
sense
it
makes
to
say
a
violation
of
the
speedy
trial
act
is
not
attended
by
this
automatic
rigid
release
but
a
violation
of
this
detainer
act
is
so
accompanied?
both
seem
to
be
intended
at
the
same
thing,
a
backup
to
a
speedy
trial,
kind
of
a
firm
line
on
speedy
trial.
but
certainly
in
the
speedy
trial
act
we
know
it's
waivable;
here
you
concede
it's
waivable,
but
you
say
it
hasn't
been
waived.
i
don't
understand
why
one
would
not
want
to
interpret
those
two
prescriptions
differently.
unknown
speaker
suppose
this
judge
were
aware,
this
state
trial
judge,
of
the
120-day
provision,
he
had
it
in
his
mind,
and
he
said
at
that
conference
to
set
the
trial
date;
i
know
about
the
limit,
but
you've
papered
me
with
motions,
i
think
a
reasonable
extension
is
necessary,
and
so
i'm
setting
the
trial
at
x
date
and
that
is,
in
my
judgment,
a
reasonable
continuance
in
light
of
all
the
motions
that
you
filed.
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
that
to
have
happened
if
only
defendant,
instead
of
standing
silent,
had
said
to
the
judge
when
they
were
setting
the
date
for
the
trial--
unknown
speaker
--look,
you're
setting
it
after
the
120
days.
unknown
speaker
were
the
occasions
on
--
or
the
occasion
on
which
the
judge
said
put
it
in
writing
occasions
when
he
was
setting
the
trial
date,
or
were
those
general
motion
sessions?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
solovy.
mr.
abel,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
about
--
on
that
point,
whether
if
the
petitioner
has
sought
review
of
the
indiana
supreme
court's
decision
to
deny
him
relief
under
the
iad,
would
we
have
had
jurisdiction
to
review
the
petition?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
because
the
petition
would
have
raised
a
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
if
we
can
agree
to
that,
what,
then,
is
the
significance
of
the
point
that
you
made
about
this
not
being
an
act
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
arguing
this
is
not
a
law
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
that
argument
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
it
jurisdictional?
you
say
because
the
federal
courts
shouldn't
have
entertained
a
habeas
petition
based
on
a
violation
of
that
act?
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
same
language
that's
used
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
"constitution,
laws,
or
treaty.
"
so
why
does
iii?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
then,
you
accept
your
opponent's
argument
that
what
satisfies
the
requirement
of
the
law
under
the
two
sections,
54
and
55,
may
be
different?
unknown
speaker
and
hence
the
standards
applicable
should
be
different,
which
would
defeat
your
hill
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
we
hold
in
one
of
those
cases
that
this
was
a
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
but
what
language
did
we
construe
in
whichever
one
of
those
cases
it
was
that
we
decided
there
was
a
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
if
you
are
saying
in
this
second
argument
--
for
present
purpose,
we'll
assume
the
iad
is
a
law
of
the
united
states,
which
i
understand
you
disagree
with.
but
if
it
is
a
law
of
the
united
states,
is
it
not
correct
that
the
prisoner
is
being
held
in
violation
of
a
law
of
the
united
states
and
you're
arguing
that
nevertheless
there
should
be
equitable
discretion
not
to
grant
relief.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
in
stone
the
court
assumed
that
the
state
prisoner
was
being
held
in
violation
of
the
law
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
say
equitable
discretion,
you
don't
mean
a
case-by-case
analysis,
do
you?
you
know,
in
this
case
it
seems
better
to
let
the
person
go
and
perhaps
in
the
next
case
he
seems
to
be
a
worse
criminal
so
you
wouldn't
let
him
go.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
think
there's
some
truth
to
the
argument
made
here
that
the
stone
against
powell
was
based
not
on
the
extent
of
habeas
corpus,
but
on
the
--
really,
the
construction
of
the
exclusionary
rule?
unknown
speaker
in
withrow
--
i
checked
it
briefly
--
we
did
not
cite
davis
v.
the
united
states,
unless
i'm
incorrect,
and
davis
v.
united
states
was
the
case
in
which
we
said
these
two
statutes,
2254
and
2255,
are
identical
in
scope.
so
do
you
think
that
withrow
was
just
an
implied
rejection
of
that
statement
in
davis?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
how
do
you
square
withrow
with
the
statement
in
davis,
then?
unknown
speaker
you
have
alternate
arguments
for
--
on
the
merits;
one
is
stone
v.
powell
and
the
other
is
the
more
traditional
one.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
did
you
argue
stone
v.
powell
or
was
that
something
that
the
seventh
circuit
developed
on
its
own?
unknown
speaker
but
now
that
you
have
it,
you
are
supporting
it.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
are
right
on
that.
the
other
factors,
though,
cut
against
you,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
right
is
personal.
it
has
a
relationship
to
the
truth-seeking
function.
the
violation
is
judicial,
not
executive.
i
mean,
those
all
cut
against
you.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
may
i
suggest
this
distinction
on
stone
against
powell.
can
one
not
read
stone
against
powell
as
saying
that
the
defendant
was
held
pursuant
to
a
state
court
judgment
that
may
have
been
obtained
in
a
proceeding
in
which
a
procedural
violation
of
the
law
of
the
united
states
occurred,
rather
than
being
held
in
direct
violation
of
the
law
of
the
united
states.
which
is
--
if
one
assumes
that
the
iad
is
a
law
of
the
united
states,
the
petitioner
here
is
being
held
in
violation
of
that
law
because
it
mandatorily
requires
his
release.
isn't
that
a
distinction?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
jurisdiction
to
hold
him
other
than
pursuant
to
the
charges
that
would
have
been
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
but
now
you're
making
a
different
argument.
now
you're
arguing
that
he's
not
being
held
in
violation
of
a
law
of
the
united
states
because
it's
a
statute
of
limitations
which
he
waived.
is
that
basically
what
it
is,
then?
unknown
speaker
why
is
he
--
if
it
is
a
law
of
the
united
states,
why
is
he
not
being
held
in
violation
of
a
law
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
--
i
know
they
may
have
said
that,
but
what
is
the
explanation
for
that
conclusion
that
you
find
satisfactory?
unknown
speaker
let
me
rephrase
the
question
and
get
away
from
the
debate
as
to
who's
responsible
for
the
delay.
if
one
had
a
clear
case
in
which
the
180-day
period
had
expired
and
it
was
clear
that
the
defendant
had
repeatedly
asked
for
trial
within
the
180
days
and
the
judge
said,
well,
i'm
just
not
going
to
follow
this
statute,
i'm
not
going
to
try
you
because
it's
inconvenient
for
me
until
the
181st
day;
would
that
person
then
be
held
in
violation
of
a
law
of
the
united
states,
if
you
assume
this
to
be
a
law
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
were
you
accepting
the
argument
a
moment
ago
that
any
time
a
prisoner
files
a
pretrial
motion
that
for
whatever
reason
would
have
to
be
disposed
of
prior
to
trial,
that
he,
during
the
period
that
motion
is
pending,
cannot
be
tried,
and
hence
the
running
of
the
period
is
tolled?
unknown
speaker
so
that
whenever
such
a
motion
is
filed,
the
clock
stops,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
have
they
followed
the
same
rule
when
the
state
files
motions
that
need
to
be
disposed
of
before
trial?
unknown
speaker
have
they
followed
the
same
rule
when
they're
dealing
with
a
motion
filed
by
the
state
that
requires
disposition
before
trial?
unknown
speaker
would
you
argue
with
the
same
result
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
in
our
habeas
cases
involving
federal
convictions
where
we
will
not
accept
habeas
if
there's
been
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
the
issue
below,
even
though
the
outcome
is
incorrect,
there's
no
doubt
