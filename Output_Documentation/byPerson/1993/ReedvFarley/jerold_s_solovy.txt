mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
included
in
the
interstate
detainer
act
three
legislative
imperatives
which
are
very
helpful
in
keeping
in
mind
to
resolve
this
case
properly.
the
first
is
that
the
receiving
state,
in
this
case
indiana,
when
it
was
the
actant
in
putting
the
prisoner
to
trial,
had
to
try
the
prisoner
within
120
days.
the
second
is
that
if
the
trial
did
not
take
place
within
120
days,
the
trial
court
in
indiana
was
mandated
to
dismiss
the
case.
and
the
third
is
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
are
directed
by
congress
to
enforce
the
agreement.
now,
these
provisions
--
if
i
might
call
the
court's
attention
to
these
provisions
--
are
found
at
pages
6a
of
our
opening
brief.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that's
correct.
48
states
have
voluntarily
opted
into
the
interstate
detainer
act.
congress
adopted
the
act
in
1970.
each
of
the
states
solemnly
swear
to
abide
by
the
agreement.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
court
treaded
this
ground
in
cuyler
and
in
carchman,
and,
indeed,
in
taking
the
certiorari
in
fex
v.
michigan--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--for
--
well,
i
don't
see
what
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
would
have
been
to
grant
certiorari
in
fex
if
this
were
not
a
federal
law.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
fail
to
see
the
distinction
for
--
if
this
court
has
jurisdiction
for
certiorari
and
jurisdiction
to
take
a
case
on
certiorari,
then
i
cannot
see
how
it
doesn't
qualify
under
2254
as
a
federal
law
to
be
enforced
under
habeas
corpus.
that's
not
the
government
--
position
the
solicitor
takes
in
this
case.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
again,
justice
scalia,
with
all
due
respect,
this
is
a
real
federal
law.
i
don't
see
an
order
of
law
that
says
that
the
interstate
detainer
act
is
a
stepchild
which
is
not
entitled
to
be
accorded
habeas
corpus
relief.
of
course,
the
writ
is
always
discretionary,
but
congress
here
has
spoken
very
loudly,
and
if
this
court
does
not
exercise
and
adopt
federal
rules
as
the
court
did
in
fex,
then
you're
going
to
have
havoc.
for
example--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--of
course.
a
state
can
opt
out
tomorrow.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
would
be
a
very
hollow
agreement
indeed,
and
such
a
ruling
would
cause
all
of
the
states
to
opt
out
and
disappear
from
this
act.
the
reason,
i
submit,
that
you
decided
mauro,
cuyler,
carchman,
and
fex,
is
to
say
here
is
a
national
law
which
we're
going
to
adopt
uniformly.
for
example,
justice
scalia,
in
fex
you
said
that
--
for
the
court,
that
the
180
days
ran
when
the
receiving
state
received
the
notice.
now,
if
that's
not
a
federal
law,
then
perhaps
iowa
is
going
to
say
quite
the
opposite,
it's
going
to
say
when
the
prisoner's
accepted,
and
you're
going
to
have
havoc
and
chaos
if
you
don't
have
one
national
rule.
so
it
doesn't
--
with
all
due
respect,
it
doesn't
seem
we
should
tarry
very
long
on
that
position
of
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
this
court
said,
justice
o'connor,
in
deciding
carchman,
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
this
act,
at
least
in
part
the
prisoner's
speedy
trial
constitutional
right.
now
so--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--i'd
say
the
purpose
of
the
constitution--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes.
no,
i
do
--
not
directly,
justice
o'connor.
it
was
not
directly
violated.
but
the
implication
of
the
constitution--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that's
a
very
helpful
question
to
my
position,
justice
ginsburg,
because
that's--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
i
don't
--
well,
there's
a
great
prejudice
to
mr.
reed
because
mr.
reed
has
been
in
the
penitentiary
for
11
years
and
if
the
act
were
enforced
he
would
have
been
discharged
in
september
of
1983.
so
there's
great
prejudice--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
but
this
is
very
much,
justice
ginsburg,
like
jurisdiction,
that's
always
addressed
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
it
also
is
very
much
like
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
justice
thomas
said
in
his
opinion
in
doggett
that
the
reasons
for
statute
of
limitations,
statutes
of
repose,
speedy
trial
act,
is
you
have
a
legislative
determination
that
past
that
point
in
time
the
defendant
shall
not
be
tried,
and--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--in
this
--
in
this
--
under
the
interstate
detainer
act,
justice
ginsburg,
the
defendant,
the
prisoner,
does
not
have
to
assert
the
defense.
when
the
prosecutor,
in
this
case
mr.
brown,
signed
the
request
for
the
detainer,
he
stated
that
he
would
bring
mr.
reed
to
trial
within
the
provisions
of
section
4(c),
and
that
is
the
120-day
provision.
and
this
case
is
rarely
going
to
happen
again,
because
the
problem
in
this
case
was
that
mr.
brown
apparently
never
read
section
4(c).
and
even
though
indiana,
like
all
the
other
states,
have
interstate
detainer
act
administrators,
he,
mr.
brown,
never
understood
that
there
was
a
120-day
limitation.
and,
indeed,
mr.
reed
filed
three
motions
in
which
he
called
mr.
brown's
and
the
court's
attention
to
the
interstate
detainer
act.
and
it
wasn't
until
he
filed
his
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
end
of
august
of
'83
that
the
court
said
in
open
court
--
and
i
quote
from
page
113
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
court
said:
"today
is
the
first
day
i
was
aware
that
there
was
a
120-day
limitation
under
the
detainer
act.
"
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
i
do
not,
justice
o'connor.
as
we
attempted
to
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
hill
line
of
cases
do
not
pertain.
of
course,
in--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes.
but
there
is
a
major
distinction.
of
course,
in
hill
the
defendant
procedurally
defaulted.
as
i
recall,
in
that
case
he
did
not
appeal.
there
is
absolutely
no
procedural
default
in
this
case.
mr.
reed
cried
out
quite
loudly
from
the
beginning
that
he
wanted
his
rights
under
the
interstate
detainer
act
enforced.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
all
courts
are
entitled
to
deference,
state
and
federal
courts
alike.
but
congress
said
in
2254
that
the
court
should
entertain
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
a
state
court
if
the
person,
here
mr.
reed,
is
held
in
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
it
does.
but
in
--
the
crucial
distinction,
in
our
mind,
is
the
fact
that
the
2255
petitioner
had
his
or
her
day
before
a
federal
court
and
had
his
or
her
day
for
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
a
federal
appellate
court.
mr.
reed
never
had
that
opportunity,
certainly
in
the
courts
of
indiana,
and
certainly
we
think
the
courts
of
indiana
misread
the
federal
interstate
detainer
act.
and
certainly--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--i'm
not
sure,
justice
souter,
i
understand
your
question.
i
mean--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
we
did
make
the
argument,
of
course,
across
the
street.
we
did
make
it
in
indiana,
and
the
question
is
whether
that's
preclusive.
and
there's
nothing
that
i
read--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
because
i
think,
if
i
read
correctly
this
court's
precedent
--
and
certainly
i've
read
a
lot
of
this
court's
precedents
in
preparation
for
this
argument
--
this
court
has
never
adopted
what
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
here,
that
a
state
prisoner
who
has
not
procedurally
defaulted,
who
has
properly
preserved
at
every
turn
in
the
road
his
or
her
right,
does
not
have
to
show--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
we
don't
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
he
was
silent
to
a
point
where
he
should
be
penalized.
a,
at
that
point
he
was
in
court
without
counsel.
number
two,
under
your
federal
speedy
trial
analogy,
the
federal
speedy
trial
act,
you
cannot
waive
that
right
save
and
except
if
you
don't
file
a
written
motion
for
discharge
prior
to
trial,
and
that's
exactly
what
mr.
reed
did.
number
two,
the
statute
speaks
in
mandatory
terms
to
the
state,
not
to
mr.
reed.
and
number
three,
he
certainly
didn't
waive
it
because
way
within
the
time
period,
at
the
end
of
july
and
early
august,
he
filed
written
motions
to
the
court
saying
he
should
be
tried
within
the
time
limits.
and
the
court,
justice
ginsburg,
also
said
to
him:
"put
everything
in
writing;
i
read
better
than
i
listen.
"
and
he
instructed
him
to
put
his
motions
in
writing,
which
he
did.
so
i
think
under
these
circumstances
there
could
be
no
waiver.
now,
justice
souter,
going
back--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
i
certainly
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
i
think
you
should
adhere
to
your
dissent
and
the
reason
for
your
dissent,
and
that's
the
way
i
read
sunal,
hill,
davis.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
your
dissent
helps
me
to
show
there's
a
distinction.
at
least
you
and
i
agree
that
the
court
believes
there's
a
distinction,
and
that's
very
important
for
my
position.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
there
--
if
you
can,
justice
scalia
--
if
you
can,
then
there
is
a
very
good
reason.
because,
as
i
said
before
and
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
the
2255
petitioner
has
had
his
or
her
day
before
a
federal
court
and
a
federal
appellate
court,
if
they
chose.
mr.
reed
did
not
have
that
opportunity
until
he
walked
across
the
street
and
filed
his
federal
habeas
corpus.
and
i
say
this
is
much
akin
to
a
jurisdictional
argument.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
agree,
and
i
agree
that
that's
where,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
analogy
stops.
this
is
a
very
important
writ.
it's
a
very
important
right
to
a
state
prisoner,
because
we
respectfully
submit
indiana
did
not
get
it
right.
here
is
a
gentlemen
who
is
now
64-years-old
who
is
going
to
--
he
has
11
years
on
a
34-year
sentence
for
a
$4,600
larceny.
he's
not
a
cinderfella.
i
mean
he
has
a
record.
but
still,
he
has
served
there
11
years
and
we
believe
that
had
this
court
reviewed
this
directly,
he
would
be
walking
free,
because
it's
clear
they
did
not
comply
with
this
act.
now--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--no,
i
think
at
that
point
the
gentlemen
--
the
prisoner
would
have
been
precluded
because
he
would
have
presented
his
claim
to
the
federal
district
court
and
then
to
the
appellate
court,
and
i
assume
certiorari
was
denied.
and
although
i
think
perhaps
a
compelling
case
could
be
made
for
him
for
miscarriage
of
justice,
unless
he
overcame
a
very
substantial
hurdle,
he
would
be
stuck
in
prison.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that's--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that's
exactly
why
i
think
comity,
the
reasons
for
deferring
in
federal
habeas
corpus
does
not
pertain
here,
justice
ginsburg.
because
you're
not
retrying
whether
mr.
reed
is
guilty
or
innocent.
you're
trying
the
question
of
whether
the
court
had
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
to
try
mr.
reed
past
120--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--i
agreed
it
was
like,
but
i
did
not
agree
that
it
wasn't
jurisdictional,
because
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
if
you
look
at
page
6a
of
our
appendix,
it
says
that:
"in
respect
of
any
proceeding
made
possible
by
this
article.
"
so
the
proceeding
is
made
possible
by
the
article.
number
two,
if
you
look
at
7a,
section
v(c),
it
says
that
once
the
120th
day
is
gone,
then
the
trial
court
must
dismiss
the
case
and
any
retainer
ceases
to
have
effect.
so
he
has
to
be
immediately--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
in
these
terms
it
is
certainly
jurisdictional,
because
if
you
also
look,
justice
ginsburg,
at
sections
v(g)
and
(f)
and
(g)
--
i'm
sorry,
section
(d),
(f),
and
(g),
you
will
see
that
the
prisoner
remains
in
custody
of
the
sending
state;
here
the
federal
court.
he
remained
in
custody
for
all
purposes
save
and
except
for
this
trial.
now,
in
your
alvarez
kidnapping
case--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
i
think
--
you
know,
the
purposes
behind
both
of
those,
justice
ginsburg,
are
very
much
the
same.
congress
or
the
legislature
says
that
we
are
going
to
step
in
the
place
of
the
sixth
amendment.
we're
going
to
give
you
a
bright
line,
and
in
this
case
it's
120
days.
and
all
--
virtually
every
state
has
a
speedy
trial
act.
every
state
knows
the
harsh
penalty
that
--
if
you
don't
comply.
and
in
barker,
the
court
said
that,
look,
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
state
courts
what
that
bright
line
is;
that's
up
to
the
legislature.
and
here
the
legislatures
of
the
48
states
and
congress
said
that
the
120th
day
is
the
bright
line
and
prejudice
after
that
is
presumed,
because
the
prisoner
should
be
released.
and
i
do
say
it's
very
akin
to
jurisdiction,
which
is
traditional
habeas
corpus.
and
this
is
a
case,
i
say,
which
will
very
seldom
be
replicated
because
everybody
is
aware
of
speedy
trial
provisions,
everybody
is
aware
of
the
120-day
provision,
but
it
so
happens
in
this
case
the
prosecuting
attorney,
although
he
signed
that
solemn
agreement
to
try
them
within
120
days,
never
alerted
the
trial
court,
and
the
trial
court
didn't
bother
to
read
the
detainer
act
and
the
rule
was
violated.
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
is
very
seldom
going
to
happen.
it
does
not
intrude
in
any
way
upon,
i
think,
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
indiana
because,
as
chief
justice
edwards
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
mars,
every
state,
in
signing
this
detainer
act,
gave
up
a
little
bit
of
their
sovereignty.
they
solemnly
agreed
to
abide
by
these
rules,
and
when
the
rules
are
broken
the
statute
says
in
bright
lights
this
is
what
will
happen.
and,
justice
souter,
the
question
about
going
to
congress;
here
if
indiana
wants
not
to
abide
by
these
rules,
then
it
should
go
to
the
state
legislatures
and
it
should
go
to
congress
and
say
make
this
a
discretionary
rule.
the
solicitor
general
and
the
state
of
indiana
attempt
to
make
much
of
the
fact
that
when
congress
--
that
congress
amended
this
act
in
1988
--
and
that's
set
forth
at
the
back
of
our
appendix
in
our
brief
--
and
congress
tacked
onto
this
act
the
mirror
image
of
the
federal
speedy
trial
act.
and
that
is
when
the
rule
is
violated
for
a
federal
--
when
the
federal
government
is
the
receiving
state,
the
federal
court,
district
court
has
discretion
either
to
dismiss
the
case
with
prejudice
or
without
prejudice.
now,
that's
a
right
which
they
chose
not
to
give
to
the
states.
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
that
shows
that
congress
meant
what
it
said,
and
that
is
when
the
line
here
is
crossed
--
and,
as
i
say,
it'll
seldom
be
crossed
--
then
the
habeas
corpus
relief
must
be
granted.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
you
would
not
be
graced
here
with
my
presence,
because
that
would
then
conform
exactly
with
the
statute.
the
statute,
justice
ginsburg,
is
so
easy
to
comply
with.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
justice--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--justice
ginsburg,
i
can
only
repeat
two
things.
one,
if
you
look
at
4-5
of
the
joint
appendix,
mr.
brown,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
solemnly
swore
and
promised
that
he
would
bring
mr.
reed
to
trial
with
the
time
--
within
the
time
specified
in
article
4(c),
and
that
was
his
job.
and
if
it
was
mr.
reed's
job,
who
was
told
put
it
in
writing,
i
read
better
than
i
listen,
mr.
reed
filed
three
motions
at
the
end
of
july
and
early
august
saying
try
me
within
the
limits
of
the
speedy
trial
act.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
think
the
--
justice
souter,
i
don't
have
an
exact
memory.
i
may
be
incorrect,
but
i
think
the
second
such
--
i
think
the
time
he
said
it
is
when
he
was
discussing
various
detainer
act
motions.
mr.
reed
was
complaining
about
his
detainer
act
rights
from
the
beginning.
he
had
an
issue
which
is
not
before
the
court.
so
i
think
he
did
say
it
at
that
time.
and
unless
the
court
has
some
other
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
may
it
please
the
court:
on
this
tolling
issue,
there
was
simply
nothing
present
before
the
trial
court
that
would
have
impeded
the
trial.
and
even
if
you
read
section
6
of
the
interstate
detainer
act
to
allow
motions
to
toll
the
statute,
that
has
to
be
determined
by
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
court
had
very
speedily
passed
upon
all
pending
motions
and
the
trial
court
simply
denied
the
motion
in
september,
1983
because
he
said
he
had
never
heard
of
the
act
before,
not
because
the
motions
had
impeded.
now,
this
court
is
well
aware,
of
course,
that
time
limits
have
very
important
significance
to
lawyers.
if
you
get
on
the
91st
day
the
best
certiorari
petition
you
have
ever
read
in
your
entire
judicial
career,
unless
an
extension
has
been
granted,
congress
says
forget
that
petitioner.
you
have
no
authority
to
--
you
can
read
it,
but
you
can't
grant
it.
in
coleman
v.
thompson,
a
death
penalty
case,
the
court
did
not
consider
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
that
case
because
his
counsel
had
filed
his
appeal
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
on
the
33rd
day
rather
than
the
30th
day.
time
is
important.
time
constraints
are
important.
the
iad
says
exactly
what
would
happen.
and
for
whatever
significance
one
can
draw
from
it,
no
state
has
filed
an
amicus
in
this
case
supporting
indiana
because,
i
submit,
it
is
clear
the
time
limitation
of
4(c)
is
crystal
clear
and
these
cases
rarely
happen,
but
mr.
reed
has
spent
11
years
in
the
penitentiary
in
violation
of
a
law
of
the
united
states.
and,
lastly,
i
started
to
mention
alvarez,
and
that
was
a
kidnapping
case,
and
to
determine
whether
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
try
the
doctor
in
that
case,
who
had
been
kidnapped
from
mexico,
the
court
carefully
looked
at
the
extradition
treaty
with
mexico
and
decided
that
nothing
was
amiss
by
kidnapping
and
bringing
him
here,
and
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
try
it.
if
you
look
at
the
iad,
something
is
very
amiss
here,
and
that
is
that
the
treaty
by
which
indiana
got
mr.
reed
from
the
federal
jurisdiction
said
you
must
try
him
within
120
days.
that
didn't
happen.
we
submit
that
the
writ
should
be
granted.
unless
you
have
any
other
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
