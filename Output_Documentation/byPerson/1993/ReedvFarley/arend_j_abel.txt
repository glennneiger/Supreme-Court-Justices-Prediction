mr.
arend
j.
abel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
outline
our
argument,
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
basic
fact
about
the
iad,
and
that
is
simply
that
it
was
not
imposed
by
congress
upon
the
states.
petitioner
has
suggested
at
various
points
that
congress
decided
not
to
give
the
states
this
or
that
right,
or
congress
said
what
it
meant
in
the
iad.
the
simple
fact
is
that
the
iad
was
an
agreement
that
the
states
voluntarily
entered
into.
this
court
detailed
the
background
and
history
of
that
in
united
states
v.
mauro,
the
underlying
materials
themselves
detail
that,
and
so
i
wanted
to
make
that
point
clear.
that
having
been
said,
our
three
basic
arguments
are,
first--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--absolutely,
your
honor.
both
the
language
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
governing
this
court's
jurisdiction
are
quite
different
from
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
and
this
court
has
held
in
many
cases
which
involved
original
actions,
but
also
in
cases
on
certiorari
from
the
state
courts,
that,
in
essence,
this
court
must
have
the
power
to
have
the
final
say
on--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--we
don't
dispute
that
there
is
a
federal
question
involved
in
the
iad.
absolutely,
there
is
a
federal
--
there
is
--
i
think
in
the
words
of
one
of
those
compact
clause
cases,
a
federal
right,
title,
privilege,
or
immunity,
the
court
didn't
distinguish
among
those
in
that
particular
case.
and
we
also
believe
that--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--that
--
the
significance
of
that,
i
think,
is
that
the
term
"laws
of
the
united
states",
as
used
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
is,
indeed,
quite
different
from
the
terms
of
the
certiorari
statute.
and
as
this
court
has
noted,
those
terms
take
their
meaning
from
context.
the
context
of
the
habeas
statute
was
reconstruction
--
the
reconstruction
--
congress
was
anticipating,
in
essence,
resistance
to
the
civil
rights
acts
that
it
either
had
passed
or
was
planning
to
pass,
as
well
as
to
the
post-civil
war
amendments,
and
it
wanted
to
provide
a
forum
in
the
federal
district
courts
to
deal
with
that.
that
is,
again,
wholly
different
from
both
the
origin
and
the
purpose
of
this
court's
jurisdictional
statutes.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
exactly,
justice
stevens.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
we
did
not,
your
honor.
we
felt
obligated
to
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention,
however,
because
it
is
jurisdictional.
and,
so,
again,
we
believe
that
it's
necessary
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
in
construing
its
terms.
indeed,
this
court--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
language
of
the
habeas
corpus
statutes,
and
in
particular
2254,
says
that
a
federal
district
court
"shall
entertain
an
application
by
a
state
prisoner
only
on
the
ground
that
he
is
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.
"
so
that
is--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--well,
again,
it's
because
--
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
very
same
language
can
mean
different
things
as
it's
used
in
different
contexts.
for
example,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
language
of
the
arising
under
clause
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution
is
considerably
broader
than
the
general
federal
question
statute,
even
though
their
text
is
basically
the
same.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
um--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
this
court
has
rather
consistently
treated
2254
and
2255,
despite
their
somewhat
differing
text,
as
providing
for
equivalent
relief.
and,
indeed,
the
court
noted
that
in
some
of
the
fundamental
defect
cases.
davis
v.
united
states
i
believe
is
one
of
them,
and
the
court
may
also
have
noted
that
in
hill.
also,
in
some
of
the
cases
applying
the
fundamental
defect
and
miscarriage
of
justice
standard,
the
court
has
relied
upon
2254
cases.
stone
v.
powell
itself
also
referred
to
the
fundamental
defect,
inherent
miscarriage
of
justice
standard
and,
of
course,
stone
was
a
2254
case.
so,
in
fact,
we
do
believe
that
that
standard
applies
under
either,
and
there
is
not
a
reason
to
differentiate
between
the
two.
and
to
the
extent
there
is
any
reason
at
all,
it
should
be
more
difficult,
rather
than
less
difficult,
to
get
relief
from
the
judgment
of
a
state
court,
because
there
is
an
overlay
of
federalism
involved
that
simply
is
absent
in
2255.
in
terms
of
our
jurisdictional
argument
--
and
i
guess,
by
way
of
example
of
what
we
mean
probably
is
a
law
of
the
united
states
as
opposed
to
what
is
not,
i
think
it's
useful
to
look
at
some
of
the
earlier
cases
under
the
habeas
corpus
act.
in
fact,
one
of
the
first
cases
decided
under
that
act
involved
an
alleged
violation
of
the
1866
civil
rights
act,
and
then
chief
justice
chase,
sitting
as
circuit
justice,
held
that
that
was
a
violation
of
a
law
of
the
united
states.
i
think
it's
also
significant
to
note
that
--
or
at
least
to
recognize
that
the
drafters
of
the
habeas
corpus
statutes
knew
what
interstate
compacts
were,
most
likely,
and
they
are
certainly
not
listed
as
a
ground
for
habeas
corpus
relief.
the
primary
argument
that
petitioner
seems
to
make
is
that
this
court's
decisions
in
cuyler
v.
adams
and
carchman
v.
nash
foreclose
the
argument
that
we're
making
here
today.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
case.
cuyler
v.
adams
was
a
section
1983
case
rather
than
a
habeas
corpus
case,
but
more
importantly,
in
that
case
there
were
alleged
violations
of
due
process
and
equal
protection,
so
there
was
never
any
question
about
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
there
and
the
iad
was
merely
construed
in
order
to
avoid
reaching
those
constitutional
questions.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that's
correct.
and
we
don't
dispute
that
it's
a
federal
question,
but
neither
22
--
section
2241
nor
2254
indicate
that
wherever
there
is
a
federal
question
involved,
habeas
corpus
relief
is
appropriate.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
well,
in
cuyler,
which
i
believe
was
the
case
with
the
extended
analysis,
the
court
didn't
purport
to
construe
any
particular
statutory
language.
it
simply
said
that
the
third
circuit
here
has
held
that
the
iad
presents
questions
of
federal
law
which
there's
federal
power
to
construe,
and
we
have
to
decide
whether
that's
right.
again,
no
jurisdictional
question
was
involved
and
so,
of
course,
the
court
didn't
refer
to
any
of
the
jurisdictional
statutes.
carchman
v.
nash,
another
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
petitioner,
simply
did
not
explicitly
discuss
a
jurisdictional
point.
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
where
a
case
simply
reaches
the
merits,
as
carchman
did,
without
discussing
the
jurisdictional
point,
it's
not
to
be
viewed
as
binding
when
the
jurisdictional
question
is
subsequently
squarely
raised.
fex
v.
michigan
we
believe,
frankly,
in
essence
proves
our
argument.
the
court
granted
certiorari,
but
our
argument
basically
is
that
the
certiorari
statute
has
much
different
terms
and
different
language
than
the
habeas
corpus
statutes.
and
so
for
all
of
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
there
simply
was
not
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
habeas
corpus
claim.
secondly,
even
if
there
were
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
claim,
relief
should
nonetheless
be
denied
for
the
reasons
this
court
gave
in
stone
v.
powell
and
the
analysis
that
it
has
followed
and
refined
as
recently
as
last
term
in
withrow
v.
williams.
in
essence,
what
that
analysis
recognizes
is
that
habeas
corpus
is
an
equitable
remedy
and
it
is
therefore
discretionary.
the
language
of
28
u.s.c.
section
2244
explicitly
recognizes
that
the
granting
of
relief
is
discretionary.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that's
correct.
and,
again,
what
section
2243
specifies
is
that
the
court
should
dispose
of
the
matter
as
law
and
justice
require.
that's
a
grant
of
equitable
discretion,
and
we
believe
stone
v.
powell,
which
ought
to
apply,
we
think,
to
this
case,
is
an
example
of
what
i
think
judge
friendly
called
discretion
hardened
by
experience
into
rule.
stone
is
a
--
frankly,
it's
a
discretionary
rule,
as
the
court
recognized
in
stone
itself,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
withrow,
what
it
represents
is
a
balancing
of
the
need
for
habeas
corpus
on
the
one
hand
and
the
costs
of
granting
habeas
corpus
on
the
other.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
to
the
extent
that
the
exclusionary
rule
as
developed
by
this
court,
which
is
at
least
as
federal
as
the
iad,
is
a
law
of
the
united
states,
then
i
believe
the
court
was
required
to
assume
that.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
no,
not
at
all.
as
i
said,
i
think
it's
an
example
of
what
you
call
discretion
hardened
by
experience
into
rule.
it's
a
--
it
is
discretionary
in
the
same
sense
that
the
credential
concerns
that
this
court
sometimes
recognizes
in
declining
jurisdiction,
despite
the
fact
that
a
case
or
controversy
might
fall
under
article
iii,
are
discretionary.
it's
discretionary
in
that
sense,
with
the
court
system
as
a
whole
and
on
a
reasoned
principle
basis
rather
than
simply
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
there's
certainly
language
in
stone
to
that
effect.
if
that
were
all
stone
v.
powell
were
about,
however,
it
certainly
would
not
have
been
necessary
for
the
court
to
explore
the
contours
of
stone
on
four
separate
occasions,
none
of
which
involved
the
fourth
amendment,
over
a
period
of
about
20
years.
so
i
think
stone
does
represent
something
more
than
merely
the
scope
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
i
think
that
is
clear
from
the
majority
opinion
last
term
in
withrow
v.
williams.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
take
such
a
drastic
step
and
overrule
not
only
davis'
treatment
of
the
statutes
as
basically
equivalent,
but
also
that
treatment
in
a
number
of
other
cases,
that
it
would
have
done
so
expressly.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
well,
we
believe,
in
essence,
that
stone
v.
powell
and
its
rule
represents
a
fact
situation
or
a
rule-situation
specific
application
of
the
fundamental
defect,
inherent
miscarriage
of
justice
standard;
that,
in
essence,
what
stone
represents
is
the
court's
conclusion
that
an
alleged
violation
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
which,
by
hypothesis,
evidence
that
is
perfectly
trustworthy
has
been
admitted,
can
never
amount
to
a
fundamental
defect
that
inherently
results
in
a
complete
miscarriage
of
justice.
so
we
think
there's
a
close
relationship
to
the
two,
and,
in
fact,
stone
adverted
to
the
fundamental
defect
test
from
hill
and
davis.
so
we
think
there
is
a
very
close
relationship
between
the
two.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that
was
something
--
we
did
not
argue
it.
it
was
developed
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
was
the
basis
of
the
seventh
circuit's
decision.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
well,
among
other
things,
we're
supporting
it
because
we
believe
the
seventh
circuit
was
correct.
and
the
reason
why
we
believe
stone
v.
--
the
stone
v.
powell
rule
is
more
appropriate
than
a
case-by-case
fundamental
defect
analysis
is,
in
essence,
the
factor
that
this
court
identified
as
most
important
to
its
decision
last
term
in
withrow,
which
is
whether
applying
a
rule
like
stone
v.
powell
would
do
any
good.
the
court
in
withrow
--
i
believe
the
language
in
the
opinion
is
that
the
court
had
substantial
--
had
reason
to
believe
that
substantially
all
miranda
claims
could
simply
be
recast
as
involuntariness
claims
under
the
fifth
amendment.
that
is
certainly
not
the
case
with
claims
such
as
petitioner
raises
here.
there
is
no
reasonable
prospect
of
even
a
colorable
claim
based
on
the
sixth
amendment
in
cases
which
allege
nothing
more
than
the
lapse
of
a
few
extra
days
under
the
iad.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
i--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--i
suppose
i
would
disagree
with
the
notion
that
it
does
have
the
kind
of
relationship
to
the
truth-seeking
function
that
those
rules
--
in
which
the
--
in
the
cases
where
the
court
has
declined
to
apply
stone
have
had.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
what
those
are.
of
course,
withrow
involved
alleged
miranda
violations.
kimmelman
v.
morrison
involved
denial
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
rose
v.
mitchell
involved
race
discrimination
in
grand
jury
selection
and
jackson
v.
virginia
involved
constitutionally
insufficient
evidence,
which
goes
to
the
very
core
of
the
reliability
of
the
guilt
in
its
determination.
in
fact,
each
of
these,
with
the
possible
exception
of
rose,
are
rights
that
do
go
to
the
very
core
of
our
confidence
in
the
reliability
of
the
outcome
of
the
criminal
trial.
rose,
i
think,
is
a
slightly
different
case
because
it's
based
on
two
additional
factors.
not
only
our
confidence
--
knowing,
as
know,
that
grand
jury
proceedings
don't
ultimately
affect
the
verdict
in
a
trial,
but
it's
also
based
on
society's
perception
and
confidence
in
the
judicial
system.
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
stone
scale,
if
you
will,
the
court
noted
in
rose
that
there
would
not
be
new
federal-state
tensions
because
the
court
had
been
granting
relief
based
on
race
discrimination
in
jury
selection
for
approximately
a
century
at
the
time
rose
was
decided.
the
iad
simply
doesn't
fall
in
the
same
class
as
those
alleged
rights.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
well,
it
mandatorily
requires
dismissal
of
the
charges.
to
say
that
it
requires
his
release
in
the
sense
of
habeas
corpus--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--well,
certainly,
that's
the
basis
of
petitioner's
detention,
is
the
judgment
of
conviction.
but
i
believe,
as
was
pointed
out
in
some
of
the
earlier
colloquy
during
petitioner's
arguments,
that
the
iad
represents,
more
appropriately,
something
akin
to
a
statute
of
limitations
than
a
jurisdictional
rule,
and
a
statute
of
limitations
is
generally
not
understood
to
be
jurisdictional
in
the
sense
necessary
to
give
rise
for
--
to
collateral
relief.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
um--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--well,
among
other
things,
because
each
court
that's
actually
reached
the
merits
of
the
iad
claim
has
held
there
was
no
violation,
and
that
includes
the
federal
district.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
i
believe
the
district
court's
explanation
was
entirely
satisfactory,
that
periods
during
which
pretrial
dispositive
motions
were
pending
are
periods
during
which
the
petitioner
was
unable
to
stand
trial,
which
are
expressly
excluded
from
the
calculation
under
the
iad.
and
i
believe
all
circuits,
save
one,
have
held
that
expressly.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
if
you
assume
this
to
be
a
law
of
the
united
states,
then
i
believe,
yes,
he
would
be
held
in
violation
of
it.
again,
i
would
point
out
the
statute
does
not
make
relief
mandatory,
but
directs
the
court
to
dispose
of
the
matter
as
law
and
justice
shall
require.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
we
believe
that
the
delay
caused
by
such
motions
are
periods,
within
the
meaning
of
the
iad,
during
which
the
prisoner
is
unable
to
stand
trial.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
yes.
and
as
i've
pointed
out,
all
of
the
federal
circuits,
except
one,
have
indeed
expressly
held
that.
i
would
also
like
to--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
arend
j.
abel
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
that
rule
has
been
followed
for
state
motions.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
i
think
that
would
be
a
plausible
result.
and,
again,
i
think
the
flexibility
built
into
the
iad
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
don't
--
we
think
it
doesn't
form
a
proper
predicate
for
habeas
corpus
relief.
it
is
designed
so
that
the
trial
court
can
continue
the
trial
on
the
basis
of
good
cause,
which
is
one
of
the
lowest
standards
that
could
be
listed.
the
trial
court
can
grant
any
reasonable
continuance.
it
is
not
designed
as
a
rigid
set
of
rules.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
however,
we
don't
believe
the
merits
of
the
iad
are
within
the
scope
of
the
court's
grant
of
review
in
this
case,
and
the
merits
of
the
alleged
violation,
and
they
weren't,
in
fact,
passed
on
by
the
court
below.
on
the
--
the
other
points,
i
guess,
on
the
stone
analysis
--
apart
from
the
notion
that
this
is,
in
essence,
unrelated
to
the
soundness
of
the
trial,
we
also
know
that
it's
not
a
federally
imposed
obligation.
and
even
if
it
technically
is
a
federal
law
of
some
species
enough
to
confer
jurisdiction,
which
we
don't
think
it
is,
we
believe
the
essentially
non-federal
nature
of
it
is
an
additional
equitable
factor
counseling
against
the
grant
of
habeas
corpus
relief.
we
know
it's
not
such
a
federal
requirement
because
it
does
not
apply
in
all
states.
and
i
believe
there
was
a
statement
earlier
that
there
was
some
notion
of
a
national
uniform
mandate.
that's
simply
not
accurate.
there
are
two
states
in
which
it
doesn't
apply
at
all.
even
in
the
states
where
it
does
apply,
it
applies
to
only
the
tiniest
portion
of
criminal
defendants,
those
who
are
incarcerated
for
crimes
committed
elsewhere,
which
i
might
point
out
are
--
almost
by
definition
it
applies
to
repeat
offenders,
which
ups
the
ante
on
the
cost
side
of
the
withrow
scale.
i
guess
finally
on
the
fundamental
defect
point,
i'd
just
like
to
note
not
only
has
this
court
not
distinguished
between
section
2255
and
2254;
this
court
has
also
rejected
the
notion
that
there's
some
sort
of
unencumbered
right
to
litigate
federal
issues
in
federal
courts,
which
seems
to
be
what
petitioner's
argument
is
premised
on.
the
court
rejected
that,
we
believe,
in
swain
v.
pressley,
and
also
rejected
that
in
allen
v.
mccrory.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
i
believe
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
yes.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that
--
i
believe
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
exactly,
justice
scalia.
accordingly,
we
request
that
the
court
either
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
or
remand
with
instructions
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
