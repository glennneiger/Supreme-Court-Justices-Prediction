justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
reed
against
farley.
this
case
concerns
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
a
compact
among
48
states,
the
district
of
columbia,
and
the
federal
government.
under
the
agreement,
the
trial
of
a
prisoner
transfers
on
one
participating
jurisdiction
to
another
is
to
commence
within
120
days
of
the
prisoner's
arrival
in
the
second
jurisdiction
unless
for
good
cause,
a
postponement
is
granted.
if
trial
does
not
occur
within
the
time
prescribed,
the
agreement
cause
for
dismissal
of
the
prosecution
with
prejudice.
in
april
1983,
petitioner,
orrin
scott
reed,
was
transferred
from
a
federal
prison
in
indiana
to
state
custody
to
face
trial
on
state
charges.
trial
was
originally
set
for
19
days
beyond
the
120-day
period
and
was
subsequently
postponed
for
an
additional
35
days.
reed
filed
many
pretrial
motions
but
did
not
specifically
object
to
the
trial
date
until
four
days
after
the
120-day
period
expired.
at
that
time,
he
sought
dismissal
of
the
charges
on
the
ground
that
the
trial
court
failed
to
observe
the
120-day
limit.
the
trial
court
denied
reed's
request
because
the
judge
had
been
unaware
of
the
time
limit
and
reed
had
not
earlier
asked
for
a
trial
date
in
advance
of
the
one
set
in
open
court
by
the
judge.
after
he
was
tried
and
convicted
in
october
1983,
reed
unsuccessfully
pursued
an
appeal
and
sought
post
conviction
relief
in
indiana's
court.
he
then
petitioned
for
a
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
denied
relief
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined
by
opinion
which
we
reasoned
that
habeas
review
of
a
state
court's
failure
to
observe
the
120-day
rule
is
not
available
when
the
defendant
registered
no
objection
to
the
trial
date
at
the
time
it
was
set
and
suffered
no
prejudice
in
presenting
his
defense
stemming
from
the
delay
commencement.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
joined
by
justice
thomas,
they
withhold
without
qualification
that
federal
habeas
review
does
not
extend
to
cases
of
this
order.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
joined
by
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
kennedy.
