justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
standard
that
we
follow
in
determining
whether
we
should
permit
intervention
either
here
or,
assuming
we're
reviewing
the
ruling
of
the
circuit
court?
is
it
by
looking
at
rule
24?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
spirit
of
rule
24
i'm
not
sure
moves
me
very
far
in
your
direction.
[laughter]
even
sears
could
not
have
intervened
in
the
florida
action,
as
i
understand
it,
and
you're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
a
sense
removed
even
further
from
sears.
an
indemnitor
cannot
intervene
on
behalf
of
an
indemnitee.
it's
not
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
was
so
significant
you
didn't
move
to
intervene
in
the
florida
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
logic
of
your
rule
would
prohibit
vacatur
even
in
the
district
court
after
a
final
judgment
has
been
entered.
suppose
a
final
judgment's
been
entered,
but
within
the
reasonable
period
of
time
allowed
by
rule
60
for
moving
to
discharge
the
judgment,
the
parties
settled.
under
your
rule,
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
only
the
filing
of
the
appeal
that
prohibits
the
vacatur
of
the
judgment?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that's
the
logic
of
your
argument.
the
logic
of
your
argument
would
seem
to
me
to
prohibit
the
district
court
from
entertaining
a
motion
under
rule
60
to
vacate
the
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assuming
a
judgment,
the
parties
settle
after
judgment,
not
wanting
to
go
through
an
appeal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
arguing,
then,
for
an
automatic
rule
against
vacatur,
you're
arguing
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
look
at
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
why
the
same
rule
shouldn't
apply
in
the
district
court
under
your
logic.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
it
is
just
to
vacate
a
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
really
couldn't
have
intervened
under
general
rule
24
principles
in
the
florida
action,
could
they?
they
were
simply
an
indemnitor.
indemnitors
can't
intervene.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
really,
it's
this
particular
issue
that
causes
a
particular
injury
to
them,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
their...
the
propriety
of
intervention
ought
to
be
judged
based
on
their
interest
in
this
issue,
not
the
entire
suit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
concede
that
sears
would
have
had
an
interest
in
intervening
in
this
suit
on
the
appellate
level?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
didn't
seek
to
intervene
in
this
litigation,
did
they?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
argue
for
a
rule
of
automatic
vacatur
in
all
cases,
if
the
parties
so
stipulate,
or
is
the
ninth
circuit
approach
the
preferred
approach?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you'd
take
the
same
position
if
the
issue
was
before
the
district
court
on
a
rule
60
motion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
rule
60
doesn't,
in
specific
terms,
permit
that.
i
think
some
of
its
language
might
be
interpreted
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
rule
60
talks
about
whether
it's
any
longer
equitable
that
the
judgment
should
have
prospective
application,
and
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
inconsistent
with
an
automatic
rule
of
vacatur
that
you
are
asserting
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
may
have
much
to
say
for
it,
but
i'm
pointing
out
that
that
takes
away
the
effect
of
the
language
in
rule
60
that
the
district
court
is
to
determine
whether
it's
equitable
that
the
judgment
should
have
prospective
application.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
would
give
the
same
answer
if
there
was
another
panel
of
the
same
circuit
that
confronted
the
same
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
it
would
be
bound
by
the
earlier
opinion
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
the
circuit.
at
least
that's
consistent
with
the
answer
you've
given
to
the
chief
justice
with
reference
to
the
district
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
does
have
precedential
effect?
