justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
if
we
could
take
your
petition
as
being
impliedly
a
petition
to
reverse
the
lower
court
for
abuse
of
discretion,
why
couldn't
we
accept
it
as
impliedly
a
motion
to
intervene
here,
and
even
if
they
didn't
abuse
their
discretion
in
denying
it,
we
would
still
be
free
to
grant
it,
wouldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
should
we
impliedly
take
it
to
be
the
one
rather
than
impliedly
take
it
to
be
the
other?
i
mean,
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
couldn't
it
conceivably
be
challenged?
i
mean,
you
agreed
readily
with
the
chief
justice
that
if
we
don't
allow
the
challenge
here
nobody
can
challenge
it.
i
understand
why
you
would
agree
readily,
but
why
wouldn't
you
be
able
to
challenge
it
in
the
later
proceeding
by
simply
alleging
that
the
vacatur
was
invalid,
and
that
therefore
there
is
collateral
estoppel
effect?
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
conceivable
manner
of
challenging
it?
it
was
contrary
to
law,
therefore
invalid,
therefore
the
effect
of
the
judgment
continues.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
suppose,
you
know,
a
district
judge
just
takes
it
on
himself
for
no
reason
at
all
to,
you
know,
erase
his
judgment.
he
just
proclaims,
i'm
vacating
my
judgment.
surely
that's
not
effective,
if
it's
contrary
to
law,
and
in
a
later
proceeding
you'd
be
able
to
say
it's
null
and
void.
why
couldn't
you
do
that
in
the
illinois
case?
you
are
a
party
on
the
interlocutory
appeal.
it
says
izumi
and
sears,
petition
for
permission
to...
for
the
1292--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mintz,
what
do
you
mean
by,
as
a
general
rule?
i
confess
not
to
understand
what
you're
asking
us
to
adopt.
you
mean
an
invariable
rule,
no
vacatur
at
the
appellate
level?
invariable
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
problem
here
was
that
the
parties
went
to
the
court.
what
they
should
have
done
was,
they
should
have
gone
through
with
the
appeal,
have
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
affirmed,
then
they
should
have
filed
a
60(b)
motion
with
the
district
court
asking
the
district
court
to
vacate,
and
they
could
have
entered
into
a
deal,
i
suppose,
before
the
appeal
was
concluded.
no
matter
who
wins,
after
the
appeal
is
concluded,
if
the...
or
rather,
if
it's
affirmed
after
the
conclusion
of
the
appeal,
we'll
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
ask
that
it
be
vacated.
do
you
have
no
problem
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
weird.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
what's
the
magic
of
the
district
court?
the...
it's
not
somehow
the
magic
that
the
district
judge
knows
when
to
vacate
and
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
i
don't
understand
why...
why
you
would
allow
the
district
court
to
do
it.
i
thought
that
you
were
arguing
for
a
rule
of
principle
here,
that
a
judgment
is
a
judgment
and
it
is
not
to
be
traded
by
private
parties
once
its
issued.
it
is
a
public
act,
and
after
that
you
leave
it
alone.
i
thought
that
was
the
principle
you
were
arguing
for.
but
you're
saying
well,
you
can't...
you
can't
trade
it
at
the
appellate
level,
you
have
to
trade
it
at
the
district
level.
why
isn't
it
just
as
final
at
the
district
court
level?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
60(b)
doesn't
make
it
clear
that
you
can
vacate
because
the
parties
want
it
vacated.
i
mean,
maybe
you
can
vacate
because
of
discovered
fraud,
because
of
all
sorts
of
things.
there
are
other
reasons
to
vacate.
60(b)
doesn't
require
me
to
admit
that
settlement
by
the
parties
is
a
valid
grounds
for
vacating,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
mentions
vacating,
but
there
are
many
other
reasons
than
merely
the
parties
cutting
a
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
person
who
has
an
interest
in
a
judgment
because
that
judgment
will
assist
that
person's
case
has
a
right
to
intervene?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they'd
already
cited
the
opinion
in
a
brief,
as
authority?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
collateral
estoppel.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
a
law
review
article...
just
persuasive
effect.
it
has
no
precedential
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
would
be
yes,
it's
like
a
law
review
article.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
disembodied
opinion,
without
any
judgment
to
go
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
judicial
opinion
without
a
judicial
judgment.
it
becomes
a
judicial
opinion
only
because
it
is
attached
to
a
judgment.
it
is
the
explanation
of
a
judgment,
and
if
there's
no
judgment
for
it
to
attach
to,
it
is
not
an
opinion
any
more.
it's
a
nice
law
review
article,
but
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
a
court
continues
to
be
bound
by
it.
the
power
of
the
court
is
to
render
a
judgment,
and
the
opinion
is
the
official
act
explaining
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no...
you
keep
saying
persuasiveness.
you
gave
that
answer
first,
but
you've
now
completely
changed
and
said,
it's
not
just
persuasive,
it's
authoritative.
it
is
binding.
it
has
stare
decisis
effect.
that
isn't
persuasiveness.
you
follow
stare
decisis
even
if
you
think
the
opinion's
wrong.
that's
not
persuasion,
it's
compulsion,
and
i
gather
you
are
now
saying
that
that's
the
effect
of
a
vacated
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
beeney,
could
i
ask
you
the
same
question
that
was
asked
to
mr.
mintz?
what
kind
of
a
rule
are
you
arguing
for?
are
you
arguing
for
an
absolute
rule
that
whenever
the
parties
seek
vacatur,
both
the
parties,
it
must
be
granted,
always
and
invariably?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you'll
take
something
less
than
that,
so
long
as
it
applies--
[laughter]
i
understand.
but
you
think
that
that
is
the
better
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it'll
only
prompt
those
settlements
in
those
cases
where
the
effect
of
the
settlement
will
be
to
enable
future
district
court
litigation.
sure,
it'll
always
foster
settlement
in
the
particular
court
of
appeals,
but
only
when...
only
when
the
effect
of
the
settlement
will
be
to
promote
further
litigation
in
the
district
court,
isn't
that
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
