mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
questions
about
the
precedential
effect
of
opinions
accompanying
vacated
judgments.
in
our
view,
the
vacatur
of
a
judgment
renders
the
accompanying
opinion
of
no
precedential
effect,
so
that
it
would
not
be
binding
on
a
district
court
or
on
a
court
of
appeals
panel
if
a
previous
opinion
had...
or
the
judgment
accompanying
a
previous
opinion
had
been
vacated.
we
believe
this
court
said
as
much
in
county
of
los
angeles
v.
davis
and
the
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
in
keeping
with
the
general
rule
set
forth
by
this
court
in
united
states
v.
munsingwear,
this
court
has
long
followed
a
consistent
practice
of
vacating
lower
court
judgments
when
cases
are
rendered
moot
by
settlement.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
your
honor,
it's
true
that
mootness...
that
a
case
is
not
necessarily
moot
when
one
of
the
parties
has
merely
ceased
its
conduct,
and
in
those
circumstances
munsingwear
does
not
apply,
but
where
the
parties
have
reached
a
conclusive
settlement
agreement
that
binds
the
parties
and
conclusively
resolves
the
case,
as
in
this
case,
the
district
court
entered
a
judgment
of
dismissal
with
prejudice.
this
case
is
not
going
to
arise
again
in
the
future,
so
this
is
not
like
the
w.
t.
grant
case,
where
the
case
is
not
truly
moot,
because
the
very
same
issue
may...
the
very
same
circumstances
could
arise
again.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
this
court
has
applied
munsingwear
in
cases
where
mootness
occurs
as
a
result
of
the
conduct
of
one
of
the
parties.
indeed,
munsingwear
itself
involved
mootness
that
occurred
as
a
result
of
the
conduct
of
one
of
the
parties,
the
united
states,
and
the
court
in
numerous
other
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief...
deakins
v.
monaghan,
the
webster
case,
the
frank
v.
minnesota
newspaper
association
case,
cases
decided
on
the
merits
as
well
as
the
summary
opinions
issued
by
the
court
in
settlement
cases,
all
show
that
munsingwear
is
not
limited
to
the
context
of
mootness
that
occurs
for
reasons
outside
of
the
litigation,
that
even
where
a
party...
for
instance,
in
the
frank
case
where
the
government
changed
its
position
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
a
statute,
and
the
plaintiff
then
said
well,
we
are
no
longer
interested
in
disputing
this
issue
because
we're
satisfied
with
the
government's
new
position,
this
court
did
not
merely
dismiss
the
appeal
as
the
winning
party
below
had
suggested.
rather,
the
court
vacated
the
judgment
below,
applying
munsingwear,
because--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--there
are
two
cases
of
which
i'm
aware,
one
in
the
1800's
and
one
in
1911,
in
which
the
court
dismissed
the
appeal,
but
that
doesn't
indicate
that
the
court
has
not
followed
the
consistent
practice
of
vacatur
when
the
parties
request
it.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
court
has
not
addressed,
after
full
briefing
and
argument,
this
precise
question,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
has,
however,
followed
a
consistent
practice
for
at
least
50
years
or
more,
certainly
since
the
1930's,
and
there's
no
indication
that
the
court
has
ever
rejected
this
approach.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
we
believe
that
a
discretionary
rule
would
have
considerable
judicial
diseconomies
in
that,
it
would
require
courts
of
appeals
to
weigh
the
various
unclear
factors
in
particular
cases
without
clear
guidance
as
to
what
factors
should
be
given
weight.
it
would
be
particularly
problematic
in
this
circumstance,
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
there
would
be
no
adversity.
there
would
be
no
party
to
explain
to
the
court
what,
if
any,
reasons
there
were
for
denying
vacatur,
so
the
court
would
in
effect
be
making
speculation
about
the
possible
future
effect
of
its
judgment
in
the
absence
of
a
presentation
by
adversary
parties.
we
think
that,
moreover,
the
inducement
to
settlement
provided
by
a
certain
rule
of
vacatur
provides
additional
judicial
economies
because
it
encourages
parties
to
enter
into
settlement
agreements
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
vacatur
will
be
available.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
court
certainly
has
jurisdiction
and
power
to
reach
the
issue
of
vacatur.
certainly
the
fact
that
izumi
did
not
squarely
present
this
question
in
their
petition
for
certiorari,
at
least
in
the
questions
presented,
suggests
that
the
court
could
deem...
easily
could
waive
the
question,
but
the
court
could
either,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
treat
the
petition
for
certiorari
as
an
implicit
motion
for
intervention
in
this
court,
or
could
conclude
that
the
intervention
question
was
somehow
included
in
the
question
that
was
presented
in
the
petition
implicitly
and
therefore
reach
that
question
as
well.
we
agree,
of
course,
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
one
of
the
concerns.
we
believe
that
the
problem
with
petitioner's
position
is
that
it
places
the
interests
of
third
parties
and
the
principles
and
concerns
underlying
the
doctrine
of
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
above
the
interests
of
the
parties
to
the
case
precisely
in
circumstances
where
the
premises
for
application
of
collateral
estoppel
do
not
apply.
the
premises
for
collateral
estoppel
are
that
application
of
that
doctrine
will
ensure
consistency
of
judgments,
that
we
have
reason
to
be
confident
in
the
correctness
of
the
first
adjudication,
and
that
it
will--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
leaving
this
question
to
be
adjudicated
when
it
comes
up
again
in
the
future...
that
is,
denying
vacatur
but
leaving
the
parties
free
to
relitigate
the
collateral
estoppel
effects...
will
not
provide
the
certainty
that
is
necessary
for
parties
that
will
not
be
willing
to
settle
unless
they
can
obtain
vacatur
and
be
certain
that
collateral
estoppel
will
not
be
applied
in
the
future.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it's
the
desirability
of
settlement
and
certainty
combined
with
the
fact
that
the
premises
underlying
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
do
not
apply
here.
just
as
in
the
mendoza
case,
where
this
court
held
that
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
would
not
be
applied
to
the
united
states
because
when
the
united
states
is
a
party,
there
are
countervailing
considerations,
such
as
the
fact
that
the
united
states
will
bring
many
more
appeals,
thereby
reducing
the
judicial
economies
that
might
otherwise
be
served
by
collateral
estoppel,
just
as
in
the
mendoza
case,
where
the
court
adopted
a
bright
line
rule
that
said,
because
of
these
countervailing
considerations,
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
will
not
apply,
we
suggest
that
by
parity
of
reasoning
in
this
case,
the
court
should
conclude
that
parties
should
be
permitted
to
avoid
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel
by
obtaining
vacatur
because
the
premises
for
nonmutual
estoppel
are
not
furthered
here,
and
because
the
interests
of
certainty
and
fairness
furthered
by
permitting
settlement
would
be
achieved
by
adhering
to
the
court's
general
rule
of
vacatur.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
question
is,
why
wouldn't
it
pay
the
government
to
do
that,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
in
many
cases--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
in
some
cases,
your
honor,
the
deposing
party
may
not
be
willing
to
agree
to
vacatur,
in
which
case
our
rule
would
not
apply.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
again,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
see
little
likelihood
that
the
government
is
going
to
routinely
take
the
approach,
but
of
course
it
would
in
some
circumstances
where,
because
it
believes
there
is
substantial
doubt
about
the
correctness
of
the
judgment
below,
or
for
other
reasons--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
true,
your
honor.
thank
you.
