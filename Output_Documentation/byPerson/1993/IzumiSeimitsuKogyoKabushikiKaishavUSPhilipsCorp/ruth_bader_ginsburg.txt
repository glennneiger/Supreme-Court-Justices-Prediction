ruth
bader

the
question
justice
o'connor
is
raising
was,
where
is
your
party
status?
you
weren't
a
party
in
the
district
court.
you
weren't
allowed
to
intervene,
so
you
had
no
party
status
in
the
court
of
appeals.
what
gives
you
party
status
in
this
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
point
is
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
you
intervention,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mintz,
you're
raising
this
very
question
in
the
seventh
circuit.
indeed,
that...
the
interlocutory
appeal
has
been
stayed
pending
this
court's
consideration.
you
do
have
party
status
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
action,
as
i
understand
it.
izumi
has
party
status
along
with
sears.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
who
is
raising
the
issue--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
seventh...
who
is
raising
the
issue
in
the
seventh
circuit
of
the
effect
of
the
vacatur
in
the
federal
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
when
the
district
court
undid
that
ruling,
who
took
the
interlocutory
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
not
appealing
in
the
seventh
circuit?
izumi
is
not
appealing
in
the
seventh
circuit,
is
not
party
to
that
interlocutory
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
is,
isn't
that
the
proper
forum
in
which
to
raise
this
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you're
not
raising
the
question,
or
sears
isn't
raising
the
question
that
it
was
improper
to
vacate
it?
because
after
all,
this
is
an
attribute
of
a
federal
judgment.
the
answer
can't
ultimately
be
different
in
one
circuit
than
in
the
other.
so
you're
not
raising,
or
sears
is
not
raising
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
propriety
of
the
vacatur?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
during
the
seventh
circuit
on
that
interlocutory--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
my
question
to
you
is,
couldn't
you
raise
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
very
question
that
you
are
now
raising
here,
and
if
you
are
a
party,
and
you
expressed
some
doubt
whether
you
were
or
not,
to
that
interlocutory
appeal,
then
you
would
not
have
the
threshold
problem
that
you
have
at
the
moment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
understand
"law
of
the
case".
you
weren't
a
party.
you
weren't
a
party
in
the
federal
circuit.
that's
what
gives
you
your
present
problem.
but
if
you
weren't
a
party,
you
would
not
be
bound
by
what
they
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
you
don't
think
you
could
raise
this
question
in
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
seventh
circuit.
aren't
you
in
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
interlocutory
appeal
is
to
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
federal
circuit,
not
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
could
raise...
even
though
it's
the
federal
circuit,
you
could
raise
the
very
same
question
that
you're
raising
here
in
the
federal
circuit,
only
this
time
you'd
have
party
status.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
you
were
party
to
the
bargain.
here
your
complaint
is
that
the
parties
to
the
appeal
separated
and
you
were
left
out,
although
you
have
a
substantial
interest
in
the
preclusive
effect
of
that
judgment.
suppose
you
were
in
on
it,
too,
even
so
it
would
be
improper?
once
the
district
court
judgment
is
entered,
that's
it,
that's
where
you
draw
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
even--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
if
you...
even
if
you
wanted
the
federal
circuit
to
vacate
the
district
court
decision,
it
would
still
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--impermissible
for
the
court
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
interested
nonparties.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
60(b)
motion
is...
what
for
any
other
reason?
there's
a
one
year
time
limit
for
some
60(b)
motions
and
there
is
no
time
limit
for
others,
so
you
could
conceivably
bring
a
60(b)
motion
after
an
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
beeney,
but
wouldn't
it
be...
it
could
come
right
back
as
a
result
of
this
now
stayed
interlocutory
appeal
in
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
federal
circuit,
from
the
district
court,
so
isn't
it
kind
of
a
wasted
motion
to
say
although
izumi
was
not
a
party
in
this
particular
proceeding,
that
very
same
question
could
come
up
via
the
appeal
now
lodged
in
the
federal
circuit
where
izumi
is
a
party?
i
think,
respectfully
not,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
reason
is
this:
there
are
two
questions
presented
in
that
interlocutory
appeal.
the
first
one
in
which
izumi
is
a
party
has
to
do
with
the
dismissal
of
their
antitrust
claim
by
the
district
court
in
illinois
that
obviously
did
not
present
this
question.
the
second
question
raised
in
that
interlocutory
appeal
is
the
issue
of
whether
a
vacated
judgment
should
continue
to
have
collateral
effect.
that
would
not
raise
the
propriety
of
the
federal
circuit's
granting
of
the
vacation
order.
well,
what
is
the
significance
of
the
prior
judgment,
except
for
its
preclusive
effect?
this
was
a
case
where
there
wasn't
even
an
opinion
written,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
all...
what
is
the
practical
consequence
of
the
vacatur,
other
than
to
deprive
the
judgment
of
its
issue-preclusive
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
beeney,
that's
strange,
because
izumi
in
the
beginning
of
the
world
was
a
party
in
this
florida
litigation,
too,
wasn't
it,
on
the
patent
infringement
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
indeed,
one
of
the
problems
it
has
is,
it
was...
with
the
counterclaim
that
it
tried
to
assert
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
it
was
told
it
can't
do
that
because
it
should
have
asserted
it
in
the
florida
action
when
it
was
a
party
in
that
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
a
little
odd
to
me
to
say
that
sears,
that
was
totally
out
of
the
florida
litigation,
would
be
a
proper
intervenor
in
the
federal
circuit
litigation
and
izumi
not,
although
initially
izumi
was
a
party,
and
in
fact
is
being
told
in
the
illinois
court,
you
can't
raise
your
antitrust
counterclaim
here
because
you
were
originally
in
the
florida
action,
and
should
have
raised
it
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
beeney,
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
with
respect
to
not
at
all...
the
opinion
would
stand.
what
would
the
status
of
an
opinion
stripped
of
the
underlying...
of
the
ultimate
judgment
be?
it
would
be
like
a
law
review
article?
what
would
be
the
significance
of
such
an
opinion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
it
be
misleading
to
put
it
in
a
collection
of
judgments
with
accompanying
reasons,
if
its
status
is
simply
that
of
a
law
review
article?
if
it
has
no
issue-preclusive
effect
and
it
has
no
precedential
value,
it
seems
to
me
strange,
indeed,
not
the
practice
that
has
been
followed
with
vacated
judgments.
if
they're
caught
in
time
they
won't
appear
in
either
fed.
supp.
or
f.
2d.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
in
agreement
that
the
effect
would
be
like
a
law
review
article,
that
it
would
have
no
further
effect
than
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
beeney,
isn't
it
only
fair,
though,
if
you're
able
to
wipe
out
the
preclusive
effect,
so
should
izumi,
and
it
shouldn't
be
stuck
by
the
compulsory
counterclaim
rule?
if
the
florida
adjudication
is
not
going
to
have
any
effect
on
you,
shouldn't
it
equally
have
no
effect
on
izumi?
