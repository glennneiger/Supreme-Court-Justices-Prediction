justice
john
paul
stevens
and
of
course,
if
they're
right
there,
why
do
you
bother
vacating
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's
the
heart
of
your
position,
if
they're
100
percent
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
otherwise
you
surely
wouldn't
pay
$57
million
to
get
a
judgment
vacated.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
beeney,
while
i've
got
you
interrupted,
i'd
like
to
call
something
to
your
attention.
i
received
a
law
review
article
not
by
anyone
interested
in
the
case,
by
a
professor
barnett,
describing
the
california
practice
on
vacatur,
and
so
forth.
it
appears
in
the
los
angeles...
loyola
los
angeles
law
review.
i
don't
know
if
you're
familiar
with
the
article
or
not,
but
i
would
like
you
to
know
that
i've
read
it.
it
discusses
the
california
practice
in
a
way
that
has
some
bearing
on
the
issues
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
discusses
that,
and
it
also
has
some
statistics
about
settlement
procedures,
and
the
number
of
settlements
affected
by
the
practice
and
all
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
mr.
beeney,
should
there
be
any
obligation
to
give
notice
to
third
parties
who
might
be
affected
by
the
vacation
of
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
the
only
ones
who
really
have
an
interest
in
whether
it
should
be
reached...
preserved
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
presumably
the
parties
paying
to
get
the
judgment
vacated
would
have
a
pretty
good
idea
who
might
be
affected
by
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask,
on
the
encouraging
settlement,
what
about
encouraging
settlement
before
trial?
would
the
rule...
which
way
would
the
rule
cut
on
that
aspect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
don't
have
the
rule
you
propound,
wouldn't
the
defendant
face
a
greater
risk
in
going
to
trial--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
he'd
know
he
couldn't
buy
himself
out
of
an
adverse
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
same
thing
true
after
trial,
that
this
possible
benefit
is
only
one
of
the
factors
that
determines
the
amount
of
the
settlement,
it
will
not
necessarily
determine
whether
or
not
the
case
will
settle?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then,
this
rule
is
not
necessary
to
promote
a
larger
number
of
settlements,
merely
promotes
settlements
taking
a
somewhat
different
form?
