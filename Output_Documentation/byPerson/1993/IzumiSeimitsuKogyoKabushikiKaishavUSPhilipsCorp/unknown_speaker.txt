unknown
speaker
but
why
isn't
this
case
like
w.
t.
grant?
this
is
a
voluntary...
where
there's
voluntary
cessation,
there
isn't
mootness,
so
in
munsingwear
it's
when
something
external
to
the
parties
causes
the
mootness,
like
someone
dies,
but
here,
it's
the
parties'
very
act,
so
i
don't
see
that
you
can
apply
munsingwear
when
munsingwear
speaks
of
something
external
to
the
parties.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
truly
moot.
that
isn't
the
point
i
think
justice
ginsburg
was
making.
it
is
truly
moot,
but
it's
a
different
kind
of
mootness
from
the
mootness
that
occurs
without
the
cooperation
of
the
parties,
and
not
necessarily
the
kind
of
mootness
that
calls
for
a
munsingwear
vacation
of
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
we've
always
done
that?
aren't
there
earlier
cases
where
we
haven't
vacated?
unknown
speaker
we
really
haven't
focused
on
this
issue
before
though,
have
we?
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
we
really
haven't
focused
on
that
issue?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hungar,
what's
the
matter
with
leaving
the
question
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
comment
on
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
in
light
of
the
petitioner's
failure
to
raise
a
question
about
intervention?
unknown
speaker
on
the
merits,
mr.
hungar,
of
course
the
problem
of
the
court
of
appeals
not
having
specific
standards
would
be
resolved
by
the
rule
the
petitioner
argues
for
that
there
be
no
vacatur
in
any
circumstance,
and
what
is
your
principle
objection
to
that
rule?
are
you
concerned
in
part
that
there
might
be
judgments
that
are
incorrect,
or
not
well-founded,
that
become
controlling
law,
or
are
you...
or
is
that
a
concern?
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
on
that...
the
law
of
collateral
estoppel
can
accommodate
those
concerns.
collateral
estoppel
just
will
not
apply
if
there
is
some
underlying
basic
concern
with
the
judgment,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
your
principal
argument
is
that
you
just
want
to
facilitate
settlement.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hungar,
why
would--
--is
it
desirability
of
settlement
which
is
driving
your
position?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
it
pay
the
government,
in
all
cases
where
it
gets
an
adverse
decision
in
a
particular
district
and
it
doesn't
want
to
have
to
abide
by
that
decision,
to
agree
to
do
whatever
action
the
suit
requested
and...
in
exchange
for
the
winning
parties
agreeing
to
the
vacatur?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i'd
do
it
all
the
time,
if
i
were
the
government.
unknown
speaker
why
suffer
an
adverse
judgment?
just
agree
with
the
other
party.
okay,
you
won,
you
can
go
ahead
and
do
what
you
wanted
to
do.
let's
just
wipe
this
thing
off
the
slate
so
the
government
agencies
won't
be
bound
by
this
district
court
judgment.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
very
often
they
would
be.
unknown
speaker
the
expense
of
litigation,
you're
giving
them
all
that
they
want.
unknown
speaker
we'll
always
believe
that.
[laughter]
well,
if
you're
wrong
about
the
precedential
effect
of
a
vacated
judgment,
then
certainly
the
government
is
not
going
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
mintz,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
