chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
92-1123,
izumi
seimitsu
kogyo
kabushiki
kaisha
v.
u.s.
philips
corporation,
et
al.
mr.
mintz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
basically
it's
your
position
that
if
intervention
isn't
allowed
somewhere
there'll
be
nobody
to
challenge
the
vacatur,
because
the
parties,
of
course,
had
stipulated
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
only
way
you
could
get
relief
would
be
to
ultimately
get
this
court
to
grant
certiorari
certainly
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
where
the
appeal
lies
from
its
judgment
to
the
federal
circuit
isn't
going
to
decide
that
the
federal
circuit
authorized
something
that's
contrary
to
law,
and
presumably
the
federal
circuit
is
not
going
to
change
its
mind,
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
the
cutoff
point
be
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
rather
than
the
entry
of
judgment
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
the
district
court,
considering
what
sort
of
a
motion
it
would
make,
should
apply
the
same
test
as
the
court
of
appeals
should?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
just
for
the
district
court
to
vacate,
but
apparently
there
are
no
such
circumstances
for
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
so--
--so
the
court
of
appeals
should
remand
to
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mintz.
mr.
beeney,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
beeney,
you're
not
arguing
that
an
opinion
written
in
the
case
should
be
vacated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
very
same
issues
come
up
before
the
same
district
court
which
had
decided
the
case
in
which
the
judgment
was
vacated,
would
it
be
proper
to
argue
to
that
court
that
the
district
court
is
bound
by
stare
decisis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
does
mean
more
than
a
law
review
article.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beeney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hungar,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mintz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
is
no.
92-1123,
izumi
seimitsu
kogyo
kabushiki
kaisha
versus
the
philips
corporation,
and
this
case
was
argued
in
october
and
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
a
challenge
to
the
practice
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
in
ordering
the
lower
court
judgment
dismissed
where
the
parties
it
settled
the
case
on
appeal.
after
argument
and
we
decided
that
in
order
to
reach
that
question,
we
would
first
have
to
reach
a
question
which
was
not
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
that
was
whether
or
not
the
federal
court
had
properly
denied
the
motion
of
izumi
to
intervene
at
the
appellate
stage
and
having
so
concluded,
i
am
declining
to
reach
that
question,
which
was
not
presented.
the
writ
of
certiorari
has
dismissed
as
improvingly
granted.
justice
stevens
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
blackmun
joins.
