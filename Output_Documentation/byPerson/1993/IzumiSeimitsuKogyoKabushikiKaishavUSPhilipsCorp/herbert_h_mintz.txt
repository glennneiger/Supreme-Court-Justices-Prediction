mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
an
issue
of
federal
common
law,
whether
the
important
interests
of
overall
fairness,
finality
of
judgments,
and
judicial
efficiency
are
best
served
by
the
practice
of
routinely
vacating
the
trial
court
judgment
when
the
parties
settle
on
appeal,
which
is
the
practice
in
the
federal
circuit
and
applied
below
in
this
case,
or
by
a
general
rule
denying
vacatur
on
settlement
and
preserving
the
potential
preclusive
effects
of
the
trial
court
judgment.
petitioner
urges
the
court
to
reject
the
federal
circuit
practice
and
adopt
a
rule
under
which
vacatur
is
not
granted
solely
on
the
basis
of
settlement
for
three
principal
reasons:
1)
vacatur
on
settlement
is
inconsistent
with
the
court's
adoption
of
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel,
which
strikes
the
balance
between
fairness,
finality,
and
efficiency
in
favor
of
finality
when
there
has
been
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
an
issue;
and--
2)
although
defended
as
achieving
judicial
efficiency,
vacatur
following
voluntary
settlement
achieves
only
a
false
economy,
because
the
cases
in
which
vacatur
is
most
important
are
precisely
the
cases
in
which
there's
most
likely
to
be
costlier
future
litigation,
and
finally,--
3)
vacatur
empowers
a
party
who
has
lost
on
a
claim
after
a
full
and
fair
trial
to
simply
buy
out
the
adverse
judgment,
defeat
the
policy's
underlying
collateral
estoppel,
and
then
unfairly
force
parties,
such
as
izumi
and
sears
in
this
particular
matter,
to
defend
claims
which
already
had
been
rejected.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
we
did
not
have
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
a
separate
question
directed
to
the
matter
of
intervention.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
in...
not
in
a
separate
motion.
we
did,
of
course,
raise
these
issues
and
discuss
them
in
the
petition,
and
discuss
the
intervention.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
i
would
be
glad
to
address
that,
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
perhaps
the
background
facts
would
lead,
in
fact,
into
both
the
issue
of
intervention
and
set
forth
the
background
for
the
issue
on
the
merits,
and
i
think
if
we
look
at
the...
one
particular
claim,
philips
basic...
respondent
philips'
insistence
on
continuing
with
a
trade
dress
claim,
i
think
we
can
see
in
what
way
the
issue
of...
or
the
approach
of
vacatur
on
settlement
on
appeal
is
deficient,
and
essentially
what--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--well,
we
believe
that
we
fairly
raised
in
the
petition
for
cert
the
issue
of
the
federal
circuit's
denial
of
intervention.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
yes.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
yes.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
i
think
if
we...
if
the
court
does
not
find
that
the
federal
circuit
abused
its
discretion
in
denying
the
motion
to
intervene,
we
would
not
prevail
at
this
level.
i--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--yes,
i
believe
you
are.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
well,
i--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--i
would
say...
we
certainly,
in
our
petition,
intended
to
present
the
issue
of
the
error
of
the
federal
circuit
in
not
allowing
us
to
intervene,
and
to
present
to
the
court
what
we
thought
was
the
principal
question,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
practice
of
vacating
is
an...
the
way
the
federal
circuit
does
it
is
an
appropriate
practice.
the
federal
circuit
itself,
while
denying
the
motion
to
intervene,
in
fact
when
on
and
addressed
the
practice
that
it
was
following,
and
then
i
think
categorically
made
clear
that
its
practice
is
to
automatically
vacate
when
the
parties
settle
all
claims,
and
all
the
parties
to
the
appeal.
now,
i
believe
there
is
at
least
one
case
that
i'm
aware
of,
the
donaldson
case,
where
it
did
seem
to
me
that
the
court
denied
standing,
i
believe
at
this...
at
the
court,
and
yet
went
on
and
did
resolve
the
merits,
the
underlying
merits
of
the
issue.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
rule
24
certainly
applies
to...
applies
in
spirit
to
the
federal
circuit
decision
as
far
as
intervention
goes.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
well,
i
think--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--the
basis
for
intervention
in
the
federal
circuit,
if
i
may
address
that,
is
more
than
just
that
izumi
was
an
indemnitor
for
windmere,
the
party
on
the
claim...
on
the
appeal.
izumi
is
both...
was
an
indemnitor,
funded
the
defense
of
the
trade
dress
claim
which
is
principally
at
issue
and,
in
addition,
izumi's
significant
interest
includes
the
effect
of
vacatur--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--well,
the
florida...
at
the
time
of
the
florida
action,
the
merits
of
the...
izumi
itself
was
sufficiently
represented
in,
as
far
as
the
merits
of
the
underlying
claim
which
was
being
defended.
the
only
time
that
it
became
important
or
significant
for
izumi
to
intervene
was
at
the
federal
circuit
on
the
motion
to
vacate
proceedings,
and
izumi
sought
to
intervene
in
those
proceedings
virtually
instantaneously
with
the
filing
of
the
motion
to
vacate.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
izumi
is
a
party
on
the
patent
infringement
claims.
i
don't
believe
izumi
is
a
party
on
the--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--trade
dress--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--sears
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
seventh...
in
the
district
court
in
illinois,
and
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
collateral
estoppel
in
view
of
the
district
court
judgment
in
florida.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
i
believe
it's
sears
that
is
on
the
appeal.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
whether
izumi
is
on
the
federal
circuit
appeal
and
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
oh,
i
think
the...
the
question
of
the--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--vacatur?
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
no,
actually
the
issue
in
the...
the
issue
before
the
federal
circuit
is
whether
a
judgment
having
already
been
vacated
can
nevertheless
be
the
basis
for
collateral
estoppel.
i
think
that's
a
very
different
question,
and
in
fact
the
district
court
held
no,
the...
a
judgment
that
has
been
vacated
cannot
be--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--well,
that
appeal
actually
goes
to
the
federal
circuit
as
well
because
of
the
patent
infringement
claim,
and
i
don't
believe--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--not
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
the
federal--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--but
i
think
at
that
point
the...
going
up
to
the
federal
circuit
the
law
of
the
case
is
that
the
judgment
has
been
vacated
and
we're
dealing
with
the
very,
very
same
practice,
which
is
that
in
the
case
where
the
motion
to
vacate
was
brought
because
of
settlement,
the
federal
circuit
vacated
based
on
this
practice.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
but
the
federal
circuit
itself,
in
terms
of...
in
this
case,
in
the
florida
case,
having
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
florida
district
court,
i
don't
believe
that
is...
that
in
itself
would
be
an
issue
in
the
case
that
came
out
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
in
which
what
had
previously
been
a
summary
judgment
dismissing
this
trade
dress
claim
was
reinstated
by
the
district
court
in
illinois
when
the
federal
circuit
vacated
the
very
judgment
that
was
underlying
it.
i
don't
think
that
on
that
appeal
the
issue
would
be
whether
the
federal
circuit
should
or
should
not
have
vacated
the
judgment
in
the
florida
case.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
in
the
federal
circuit,
on
the
appeal--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--no.
the
appeal
in...
the
interlocutory
appeal
is
to
the
federal
circuit.
it
comes
out
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
no,
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
yes,
your
honor.
so
it's
the
same
court
that
had
already
vacated
the
florida
judgment.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
that's
exactly
right,
and
that
is
part
of
the...
i
think
of
the
problem
of
this
kind
of
rule
in
the
federal
circuit
and...
coupled
with
their
refusal
to
allow
intervention
by
the
one
party
that
is
most
affected
by
the
vacatur,
because
in
this
case
the
agreement
between
windmere
and
philips
to
vacate
the...
to
join
in
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment
followed
a
settlement
of
a
trade
dress
claim
on
which
philips
had
lost
and
an
antitrust
claim
on
which
philips
had
lost.
certainly
the
trade
dress
claim
is
the
kind
of
claim
that
is
subject
to
a
possible
preclusive
effect.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
well,
the--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
validity
of
the
vacatur
was
raised
in
the
illinois
district
court
case.
in
other
words,
the
illinois
district
court
case
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
here
was
the
federal
circuit
vacating
the
judgment,
the
judgment
is
now
vacated,
but
nonetheless,
in
these
circumstances
the
collateral
estoppel
should
apply,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
attack
was
that
it
was
an
invalid...
in
effect
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
federal
circuit
to
have
actually
vacated
that
judgment,
and
i
don't...
i
think
the
proceeding
before
the
federal
circuit
then
on
the
interlocutory
appeal,
on
the
argument
which
the
federal
circuit
already
addressed
in
this
case
that
vacatur
is
not
appropriate
in
the
settlement
situation
is
really
not
a
practical...
it's
not
going
to
be
a
practical
route
to
any
change
in
that
result.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
yes,
that's
the
assumption
that
i
would
make,
but
i
believe
that
the
case
as
it
stands
now,
i
think
presents
to
the
court
the
really
precise
issue
of
the
fundamental
problem
with
a
practice
that...
where
an
appellate
court
will
automatically
in
essence
vacate
when
the
parties
to
the
appeal
settle
and
they
settle
all
the
claims
on
appeal,
and
the
problem
with
this
basic
rule
is
that
it
does
in
effect
vitiate
the
collateral
estoppel.
collateral
estoppel
is
grounded
on
preserving
judicial
and
litigants'
resources
and
not
allowing
relitigation
of
fully
and
fairly
tried
issues,
and
when
we
are
dealing
with
judgments
that
have
potential
preclusive
effect,
the
vacatur
eliminates
even
the
possibility
of
applying
collateral
estoppel
in
the
subsequent
case,
and
we
say
that
vacatur
is
not
a
fair
price
to
pay
for
settlement
because
in
the
cases
where
vacatur
is
sought,
most
likely
there
will
be
further
litigation,
and
the
appeal
is
not
in
any
event
necessarily
saved,
which
is
one
of
the
theories
of
preserving
or
fostering
efficiency
through
settlement
on
appeal
and
saving
the
appellate
court's
time
in
deciding
the
case.
the
appeal--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--under
the
rule,
it's
not
necessarily
effected.
i
think
the
district
court
at
that
time,
pursuant
to
rule
60,
could
decide
to
vacate
the
judgment,
and
it
is
a
situation
there
where
the
district
court
would
be
fully
familiar
with
the
case,
fully
familiar
with
the
circumstances,
and
i
think
be
able
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
vacated
as
with
any
rule
60
motion.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
not--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--no,
not
necessarily,
because
i
think
the
difference
is
when
the
parties
go
on
to
appeal
and
jurisdiction
shifts
to
the
appellate
court,
which
has
not
been
involved
in
the
case,
and
i...
we
don't...
i
don't
think
we
want
the
appellate
court
then
to
be
evaluating
the
merits
of
the
appeal
and
deciding
whether
or
not
to
vacate
on
the
basis
of
the
merits.
when
the
case
is
pending
in
the
district
court,
i
think
we
have
a
different
situation
and
a
different
rule
structure.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
approach
is,
in
fact,
to
remand
when
there
has
been
a
settlement
to
the
district
court
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
vacatur
should
be
granted
or
not.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
i
believe
that
the
best
rule
is
when
the
case
is
at
the
appellate
court,
that
there
should
be
a
denial
of
the
motion
to
vacate
as
a
general
rule,
and
i
would
argue
for
that
rule.
i
think
that
provides
more
certainty
in
terms
of
enforcing
it.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
to
not
permit
the
district
court
under...
once
judgment
has
been
entered
to
vacate.
i
think
that
the
district
court
can
make
a
determination
as
it
would
in
a
rule
60
motion
if
settlement
occurred
at
the
point
that
you
have
described.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
i
would
say
the
court
should
adopt
an
invariable
rule
in
the
sense
that
i
have...
i
have
not,
at
least
in
my
own
mind,
been
able
to
really
come
up
with
a
boundary
to
the--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--i
would
draw
the
line
at
when
the
appeal...
when
the
appeal
is
filed
and
docketed
in
the
appellate
court--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--and
then--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--that's
correct,
your--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--yes.
i
think
the
rule
should
be
that
the
appellate...
excuse
me.
i
mean,
the
appellate
court
should
not
grant
a
motion
to
vacate
when
all
of
the
parties
ask
for
it,
even--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--even
when
interested
nonparties
are
willing
to
say
yes,
go
ahead
and
do
it.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
no,
i
think
that
the
rule
for
the
clearest
guidance
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
most
consistent
operation
i
think
with
the
principles
of
collateral
estoppel
would
be
to
not
grant
vacatur
in
that
case.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
it's
just
that
i'm
thinking
that
in
terms
of
the
district
court,
when
jurisdiction
is
still
with
the
district
court,
the
court
can
entertain
a
rule
60
motion
and
make
a
determination
for
itself
whether
under
the
circumstances,
all
circumstances
considered,
the
judgment
should
be
vacated.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
no.
in
terms
of
the
district
court,
i
think
can...
then
the
district
court
can
balance
all
of
the
factors,
consider
the
merits
of
the
case,
is
familiar
with
the
underlying
case,
and
can
make
a
determination
whether
or
not
this
should
be
vacated.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
yes,
your...
yes,
i
would
say
there
are...
yes,
there
are
circumstances--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--unless
the...
there
are...
the
circumstances
would
be
the
same,
but
the
difference
is
that
the
district
court
would
be
familiar
with
the
underlying
case.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
that
is
one
possibility,
and
as
i
say,
i
believe
that
is
what
is
done
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
i
think
the
better
rule
at
the
appellate
level
is
to
simply
deny
the
motion
to
vacate
and
dismiss
the
appeal.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
i
would
have
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--that
that
would
be--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--well,
i
think
if
we
have
the
court
of
appeals...
if
we
put
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
actually
go
through
the
merits
of
the
appeal
and
make
a
decision,
i
think
once
that
decision
is
made,
that
suggests...
and
the
judgment
is
affirmed,
it
suggests
to
me
that
the
judgment
should
not
be
vacated,
and
the
district
court
in
that
case...
i
don't
know
what
the
extraordinary
circumstances
might
be
to
ever
have
a
district
court
vacate
in
that
situation,
but
it
shouldn't
be
solely
on
the
basis
of
settlement
in
that
circumstance
where
the
appellate
court
has
already
affirmed
the
judgment.
and
the
difference,
the
difference
as
i
see
it
with
a
motion
that's
filed
with
the
district
court
though...
before
the
appellate
court
has
acted
is
that
the
district
court
is
familiar
with
the...
all
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
it
conceivably
could
be
brought,
but
i
think
in
that
case
the...
i
would
not
expect,
as
a
general
proposition,
that
the
district
court
would
vacate
the
judgment.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
only
because
i
think
that
a
rule...
the
rule
60(b)
does
permit
a...
has
a
mechanism
for
allowing
parties
to
ask
the
district
court
judge
to
vacate
under
certain
circumstances,
and
at
least
the
district
court
judge
in
that
case
can
weigh
these
factors.
the
problem
is
that
on
the
appeal
there
are
no
factors
weighed,
and
when
we
look
at
the
federal
circuit's
decision
as
exemplary,
the
federal
circuit
weighed
absolutely
no
factors
in
deciding
to
vacate
the
judgment
which
otherwise
would
have
had
preclusive
effect.
it
only
asks
the
question,
did
all
of
the
parties
to
the
appeal
join
in
the
motion
to
vacate,
and
does
the
settlement
settle
all
claims?
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
no,
i'm
not
arguing--
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
--i'm
certainly
not
arguing
for
settlement
as
being
a
basis
to
vacate.
if
the
case
still
is
in
that
period
of
time
from
final
judgment
to
appeal,
that
is
not
what
i'm
arguing
for.
what
i'm
arguing
for
really
is
a
rule
at
the
appellate
level
when
this
comes
up
where
parties
cannot...
a
party
who
loses
on
a
claim
like
the
trade
dress
claim
here
can't
simply
appeal,
settle
with
the
other
side,
pay
enough
money
to
have
the
appellate
court
then
vacate
on
the
federal
circuit
type
of
rule,
and
then
be
able
to
reassert
that
trade
dress
claim
wherever
and
whenever
it
wants,
after
having
lost
it.
that
is
the
rule
that
i'm
arguing
for.
mr.
chief
justice
if
there's
no
more
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
herbert
h.
mintz
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
one
point,
and
that
is
that
the...
a
settlement
of
this
type,
which
basically
goes
to
the
quantum
of
damages
that
were
awarded
for
the
antitrust
violation,
essentially
buys
out
the
adversarial
interest,
or
incentive
of
the
other
party
and
allows
through
the
settlement
a
claim
such
as
the
trade
dress
claim,
which
would
be
the
subject
of
defensive
nonmutual
collateral
estoppel,
an
asserted
right
by
the
party
that
lost,
to
be
resuscitated
just
for
the
payment
of
enough
money
to
satisfy
the
other
party,
and
the
only
real
interested
parties
who
would
be
adversaries
are
the
parties
like
sears
and
izumi,
who
are
directly
affected,
and
have
already
been
shown
to
be
affected,
in
the
other
litigation
where
that
trade
dress
claim,
once
dead,
has
now
come
back
to
life,
and
that's
why
we
say
the
vacatur
on
settlement
rule
completely
undermines
and
is
very
much
inconsistent
with
collateral
estoppel,
and
the
rule
should
be
consistent.
thank
you
very
much.
