justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mintz,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
your
client
attempted
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
motion
was
denied.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
didn't
raise
that
as
a
question
on
certiorari.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nor
has
your
client
moved
for
intervention
in
this
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
plan
to
discuss
with
us
today
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
in
light
of
those
deficiencies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
