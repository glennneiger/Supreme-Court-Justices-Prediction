mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
your
honors
please,
in
light
of
the
discussion
this
morning,
i'd
like
to
first
turn
to
the
question
of
intervention,
and
then
proceed
to
why
this
court
ought
to
reaffirm
the
rule
that
vacatur
is
available
when
a
party's
settlement
completely
moots
their
appeal.
there
are
two
questions
raised
by
the
intervention
issue.
first,
was
it
properly
presented
to
this
court,
and
second,
did
the
court
of
appeals
abuse
its
discretion
in
denying
vacatur?
we
submit
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
no,
it
was
not
properly
presented
to
this
court,
and
second,
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
denied
intervention.
the
petition
for
certiorari
raised
a
single
question
going
to
the
merits
of
the
issue
of
vacatur.
the
first
time
the
issue
of
intervention
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court
was
in
philips'
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert.
there
is
nothing
contained
either
within
the
question
presented
or
within
this
court's
grant
of
the
petition
that
would
raise
the
issue
of
intervention,
and
therefore
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
issue
was
not
properly
presented
to
this
court.
as
to
the
issue
of
the
merits
of
the
decision
by
the
court
of--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--there
was
an
opinion
written
on
philips'
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
to
set
aside
the
verdict,
but
there
was
not
an
opinion
written
on
the
merits--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--of
the
verdict
itself.
it
was
a
jury
verdict.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
that
is
quite
correct.
that
is
the
only
practical
significance,
but
izumi,
in
the
currently
pending
federal
circuit
appeal,
takes
the
position,
as
it
did
before
the
district
court
in
illinois,
that
a
vacated
judgment
under
these
circumstances
ought
to
continue
to
have
collateral
effect.
and
if,
indeed...
if
the
federal
circuit
accepts
izumi's
position
that
the
vacated
judgment
does
not...
does
continue
to
have
collateral
effect,
then
izumi
has
no
interest
here
whatsoever,
because
then
the
vacated
judgment
would
be
applied
collaterally
in
illinois,
and
their
interest
in
the
case
that
comes
from
miami
is
completely
vanished,
because
there
is
no
interest
whatsoever
in
that
case,
other
than
an
attempt
to
use
the
judgment
collaterally.
so
if
izumi
prevails
on
that
appeal,
it
has
no
interest
in
this
case
whatsoever.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
well,
we
believe
that
they
are
wrong.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
oh,
absolutely,
and
should
that
appeal
proceed--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--in
all
due
respect,
justice
stevens,
there
were
other
components
to
the
settlement.
we
felt
it
much
superior
to
pay
$57
million
then,
than
take
the
risk
of
having
to
pay
$120
million
or
$130
million
after
the
court
of
appeals
ruled,
and
obviously
windmere
analyzed
the
situation
that
they'd
prefer
to
have
$57
million
then
than
take
the
risk
of
nothing.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i'm
familiar
with
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
neary.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
have
not
read
the
review
article
though,
justice
stevens.
to
get
back
just
briefly
to
the
intervention
issue,
as
to
the
merits
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
abuse
its
discretion.
izumi's
interest
in
this
case
is
not
one
that
under
rule
24
counsels
that
intervention
should
have
been
permitted.
they
were
not
a
party
to
the
case.
they
intentionally
decided
not
to
become
a
party
to
the
case
in
order
to
protect
whatever
interests
they
may
have
in
the
judgment,
and
when
the
case
was
finally
settled,
they
only
moved
to
intervene
after
philips
had
given
up
its
right
to
appeal.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
however--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--well,
the
injury,
i
believe,
is
caused
to
sears,
not
to
izumi.
sears
is
the
party
in
chicago
that
is
attempting
to
use
the
judgment
collaterally.
here,
in
this
case,
izumi's
interest
as
an
indemnitor
vanished
when
philips
and
windmere
exchanged
mutual
general
releases.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
think
sears
should
have
been
permitted
to
intervene
in
order
to
present
its
position
as
to
what
ought
to
have
been
done
with
the
judgment.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
they
did
not,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
think
in
the
circumstances
here,
justice
scalia,
where
sears
had
already
used
the
judgment
collaterally,
i
think
under
the
spirit
of
rule
24,
i
think
that
they
would
have
been
a
proper
party
to
present
their
views
as
to
what
should
have
been
done
with
the
parties'
joint
motion
to
vacate
before
the
federal--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--i
don't
think--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--i
don't
think
that
would
have
amounted
to
an
adequate
interest
under
rule
24
to
justify
intervention,
but
i
think
where
they
had
actually
used
the
judgment
to
attain
the
elimination
of
a
claim
against
them...
i
realize
i'm
arguing
against
myself,
but
i
think
that
they
should
have
been...
had
they
moved,
been
granted
permission
to
intervene.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
well,
i
think
i
would
make
a
distinction
as
to
the
timing
of
intervention.
izumi
in
fact
did
not
even
have
to
intervene
below.
a
pretrial
stipulation
was
submitted
to
them
that
they
could
have
signed
as
a
party.
they
struck
their
name
off
that
list.
discovery
was
sought
of
them
as
a
party.
they
insisted
that
they
would
not
provide
discovery
as
a
party.
so
they
made
every
effort
to
make
it
clear
that
they
were
not
a
party,
the
obvious
reason
being
that
should
windmere
prevail
on
the
claim,
izumi
hoped
to
use
that
collaterally,
but
they
wanted
to
avoid
any
collateral
effect
should
philips
prevail
on
the
claim.
at
the
time
at
which
a
motion
is
made,
however,
to
vacate
the
judgment,
that
is
the
point
in
time
in
which
sears'
interest
arises,
not
in
the
underlying
claim
itself,
when
sears,
as
i
say,
has
already
used
the
judgment
collaterally.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
not
at
all,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
the
interests
that
are
implicated
by
the
issue
of
vacating
opinions
are
far
different
than
the
issue
implicated
by
the
vacation
of
the
judgment.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
we
would
argue
for
the
firm
rule,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
we
see
the
wisdom
in
a
rule
being
advocated
by
the
united
states,
which
is
essentially
that
when
complete
settlement
among
the
parties
moots
an
appeal,
the
judgment
ought
to
be
vacated.
the
judgment
also
ought
to
be
vacated
when
the
prevailing
party
below
unilaterally
takes
steps
to
moot
the
appeal,
thereby
depriving
the
appealing
party
of
their
right
to
appeal.
in
both
those--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--we
would,
your
honor,
and
there
are
reasons
why
we
think--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--no,
i
would
agree
that
neither
rule
60
nor
rule
42
of
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
nor
the
statute
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
directly
speaks
to
this
issue.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
well,
i
think
the
automatic
rule
has
much
to
say
for
it
for
the
very
reasons
of
certainty.
first
of
all--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--well,
i
think
rule
60
could
be
read
vis-a-vis
these
circumstances
in
that
it
is
always
just
and
equitable
to
vacate
when
all
parties
to
a
settlement
moot
their
appeal,
and
that's
the
way
i
would
urge
rule
60
to
be
read
in
this
context.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
opinion
would
continue
to
have
whatever
persuasive
effect
by
power
of
its
logic.
the
fact
that
a
judgment
was
vacated
does
not,
in
respect
of
the
opinion,
i
think,
detract
from
whatever
force
of
reasoning
the
opinion
may
have.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
well,
the
precedential
effect,
as
i
understand
it,
justice
scalia,
comes
from
the
judgment,
not
from
the
opinion,
that
the
opinion
is
the
rationale
behind
the
judgment,
but
the
judgment
is
what
is
the
precedential
effect.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
well,
i
think
i
would
submit--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--i
think
i
would
submit
that
an
opinion
written
by
a
court
sitting
resolving
a
dispute
has
far
more
persuasive
reasoning
by
that
fact
alone.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
force
of
the
opinion
would
determine
in
part
on
why
the
judgment
was
vacated.
here,
if
the
parties'
settlement
completely
moots
an
appeal
and
vacates
the
judgment,
it
does
not
go
to
the
issue
of
the
correctness
of
the
judgment,
except
perhaps
in
the
minds
of
the
litigants,
and
i
see
no
reason
why
the
opinion
should
be
deprived
of
whatever
forceful
effect
it
may
have,
simply
because
an
appeal
is
mooted
by
a
party
settlement.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
think
i
would
say
that
regardless
of
whether
the
judgment
is
vacated,
if
the
purpose
of
the
vacation
is
because
of
a
settlement,
that
that
should
have
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
persuasive
force
of
the
opinion,
because
the
reason
for
the
vacation,
the
settlement
of
the
parties,
doesn't
go
to
the
merits
of
the
reasoning
behind
the
opinion.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
think
it
would
be,
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--right,
your
honor.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
we--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--we
would,
justice
kennedy.
again,
i
think
one
needs
to
go
to--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--yes.
i
think
one
needs
to
go
behind
the
reason
of
the
vacation
of
the
judgment,
and
if
the
reason
behind
the
vacation
of
the
judgment
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
dispute,
then
there's
no
reason
why
the
opinion
ought
not
to
continue
to--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
see
why
a
vacation
of
a
judgment
for
reasons
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
action
needs
to
have
any
effect
on
the
persuasiveness
of
the
opinion.
the
precedential--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--as
i
meant
to
say
originally,
if
the
reason
for
vacating
the
opinion
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
decision,
it
ought
to
continue
to
have
whatever
effect
it
had
with
or
without
the
judgment
attached
to
it,
and
if
i
may
get
back,
justice
kennedy,
to
the
question
as
to
why
this
ought
to
be
a
firm
rule,
it
does,
we
believe,
offer
quite
a
bit
of
advantages
to
the
system.
it
allows
parties
to
know
that
they
can
settle
and
vacate
and
remove
whatever
question
there
may
be,
thereby
encouraging
settlements,
and
it
also
permits
the
courts
of
appeals
not
to
engage
in
the
type
of
collateral
litigation
that
they
would
have
to
in
balancing
the
various
interests.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
no,
justice--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--i
don't
think
that's
a
workable
rule
where
the
courts
or
the
parties
need
to
go
out
and
attempt
to
find
who
might
be
interested
in
the
issue.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
they
may
or
they
may
not,
and
again,
involving
the
appellate
court
who
receives
the
motion,
and
the
collateral
issue
of
whether
adequate
notice
has
been
given,
or
who
the
parties
who
may
be,
i
think
is
just
not
a
workable
rule.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
think
that
is
the
rule
that
we
would
argue
for,
justice
scalia,
although
i
certainly
wouldn't
preclude
the--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--i
think
that
is
the
better
rule,
and
obviously,
in
order
to
affirm
the
result
below,
however,
the
court
need
not
go
that
far.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
think
the
counterclaim
rule,
justice
ginsburg,
goes
to
a
different
point,
and
therefore
i
would
argue
your...
i
would
answer
you
question,
no,
i
don't
think
it's
unfair.
the
counterclaim
rule
is
intended
to
encourage
all
parties
to
present
disputes
that
they
have
among
each
other.
at
the
same
time,
the
rule
starts
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
so
regardless
of
whether
the
case
proceeds
to
judgment,
even
if
the
case
is
settled
before
judgment,
the
compulsory
counterclaim
rule
would
still
apply,
so
it's
not
attached
to
the
judgment,
it's
attached
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
the
interests
that
are
served
by
the
firm
rule
include
several
that
would
advance
the
system
of
litigation.
it
promotes
fairness
among
the
parties,
and
because
it
encourages
settlement,
it
conserves
private
and
judicial
resources.
there
are
a
number
of--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
it
has
very
little
effect
on
the...
weighing
whether
a
party
should
settle--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--i
think
they
would--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--i
think
they
would,
but
i
think
in
the
practicalities
of
litigation,
that
that
is
really
purely
an
academic
concern.
when
parties
are
facing
the
economic
and
other
costs
of
a
trial,
when
they
are
facing
the
effect
that
a
judgment
itself
has
on
the
settlement
components,
i
don't
think
they
look
forward
to
the
appellate
court
and
say,
well,
we
can
vacate
the
judgment
and
therefore
we
have
a
riskless
trial.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
precisely.
the
party
who
is
facing
a
trial--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--no,
i
think
it
does
have
a
profound
effect
on
promoting
the
number
of
settlements.
as
judge
winter
said
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
nestle
opinion,
as
united
states
has
said
in
its
brief
before
this
court,
and
as
the
more
than
a
hundred
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
stand
for
the
proposition,
that
this
rule
does
encourage
settlement,
and
it
allows
parties
to
abandon
the
judgment
and
settlement
the
dispute
on
their
own
terms
and
thereby
forever
removing
the
dispute
from
the
courts
in
a
consensual
rather
than
a
coercive
way.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
think
not,
justice
scalia--
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
--for
two
reasons,
1)
this
rule
has
been
in
effect
since
this
court's
decision
at
least
in
hannon-clark
in
the
1930's.
history
has
shown
that
not
to
be
a
serious
concern.
there
simply
are
not
that
many
cases
in
which
parties
vacate
judgments
and
then
relitigate
the
issue,
and
second,
i
would
say,
justice
scalia,
that
there
are
other
reasons
for
parties
to
seek
to
vacate
judgments.
admittedly,
removing
the
preclusive
effect
of
a
judgment
may
be
the
primary
one,
but
parties
also
may
feel
that
they
have
been
done
a
great
injustice
by
the
system,
and
there
may
be
various
other
reasons
why
they
seek
to
vacate
a
judgment.
mr.
garrard
r.
beeney
i
thank
your
honors.
