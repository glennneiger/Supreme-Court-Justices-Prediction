justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
creating
impervious
surface
closer
to
the
flood
plain
causes
more
of
a
problem
than
creating
impervious
surface
further
away
from
the
flood
plain?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet,
people
who
did
that
further
away
would
not
have
to
dedicate
any
of
their
land
to
the
public
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the...
fill
me
in...
doesn't
the
public
have
access
to
the
greenway?
i
thought
the
purpose
of
the
greenway
was
for
a
park.
that's
not
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
mean
after...
after
she
complied
with
the
condition
for
the...
for
the
permit,
would
the
public
have
had
access
to
the
greenway?
justice
scalia
well,
that's...
that's
one
thing
she
couldn't...
she
could
do
now
and
couldn't
do
afterwards,
which
is
keep
other
people
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
pretty
important.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
rest
your
case
on
the
difference
between
whether
an
easement
had
been
given
or
whether
she
had
to
convey
the...
didn't...
nollan
involved
an
easement,
as
i
recall,
rather
than
an
outright
conveyance,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
an
easement
is...
is
a
right
in
property,
isn't
it?
it's
a
conveyance
of
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
in
fact
thought
that
a
license
to...
to
use
land
is
the
definition
of
an
easement.
i'm
not...
can
you
create
a
license
to
use
land
that
is
not
an
easement?
can
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
i...
i
assume
you
don't
concede
that
a
proportionality
requirement
is
necessarily
in
addition
to
a
rational
basis
requirement?
i
mean,
i...
i
assume
that...
that
you...
you
would
acknowledge
the
possibility
that
something
does
not
have
a
rational
basis
if
it
is
wildly
disproportionate?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
the
time
you
take
the
snapshot
ought
to
depend
on
the
time
when
the
restriction
for
which
this
is
the
exaction
was
imposed...
that
is,
the
time
the
zoning
requirement,
which
this
exaction
is...
is
meant
to
justify
a
waiver
from,
was
imposed...
that
is
when
you'd
take
the
snapshot,
i
assume?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
property
owner
had
to
pay
some
money
for
the
increased
congestion;
wasn't
there
an
assessment,
the
$14,000,
that
was
mentioned?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is
in
addition
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
happen
if
somebody
two
lots
back
from
this
property,
two
lots
further
away
from
the
flood
plain,
who
increased
business
to
the
same
extent
by...
by
an
expansion
of
the
building,
and
who
paid
$14,000
similarly,
but
didn't
have
any
flood
plain
land
to
contribute
to
a
bike...
to
a
bike
path?
what...
what
would
happen
to
that
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
property,
there
is
something
peculiar
about
this
property,
by
being
next
to
the
flood
plain,
adequate
services
are
not
available,
so
that
you
have
to
contribute
a
bike...
a
bike
path?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you're
further
away,
what...
what
would
be
done
to
a
property
further
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
solution
to
that
was
a
bike
path?
justice
antonin
scalia
people
are
going
to
go
to
the
hardware
store
on
their
bike?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
even
contended
by
the
city,
is
it?
so,
there
is
no
relationship
between
the
increased
traffic
volume
and
the
bike
path?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
people
who
would
otherwise
be
driving
their
cars
for
recreation
will
instead
ride
bicycles
for
recreation;
is
that
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
the
notion?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
bike
paths
around
washington,
and
i've
never
seen
people
carrying
shopping
bags
on
their
bikes.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
city
planners,
i
guess
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ramis,
could
i...
could
i
come
back
to
your
footnote
four...
footnote
six
on
page
four?
i
don't
see
that
that
says
what
you've
described.
what
that
says
is
that
natural
drainage
ways
must
be
maintained
unless
submitted
studies
show
that
alternative
drainage
solutions
can
solve
onsite
drainage
problems.
that...
it
seems
to
me
that
regulation
is
meant
to
cover
the
situation
where
someone
is...
is
constructing
an
improvement
in
such
a
way
that
it
blocks
runoff
which
would
normally
occur,
not
that
it...
that
it
makes
land
more
impervious.
of
course...
i
mean,
all
communities
require
you
to
put...
put
some
sort
of
a
catch
basin
or
something
when
you're...
you've
interrupted
the
natural
drainage
flow.
but
if
somebody
makes
an
improvement
that
does
not
interrupt
the
natural
drainage
flow,
i
don't
see
any...
any...
any
requirement
that
either
one
of
these
regulations
imposes
on
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
b
as
in
buzz?
justice
antonin
scalia
d
as
in
dog.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
i
think
what
that
means
is
if
the
pipe
that's
going
into
the
municipal
conduit
that
goes
down
to
this
stream
would
be
overloaded,
so
that
there's
not...
not
enough
capacity
in
that
pipe
to
carry
it
off,
you
have
to
store
it
and
then
let
it
out
at
another
time.
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with...
so
long
as
you
can
get
it
into
the
municipal
conduit,
you're
allowed
to
do
it.
i
don't
read
this
as
having
anything
to
do
with
the
capacity
of
the
flood
plain.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
mention
them
in
your
argument
to
the
oregon
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it...
is
it
your
representation
to
this
court,
mr.
ramis,
that...
that...
that
mrs.
dolan
could
have
avoided
both
the
bike
path
dedication
and
the
flood
plain
dedication...
she
could
have
avoided
both
by
simply
agreeing
to
do
what
some
uphill
owners
would
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
alternative...
an
alternative
to
the
bike
path?
justice
antonin
scalia
something
that
would
solve
the
traffic
problem
better
than
the
bike
path
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
zero
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
so,
what
would
she
come
in
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
this
appear
in
the
record
that...
that
she
can
come
forward
with
alternative
solutions
which
must
be
accepted
by
the
city?
does
that
appear--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
you
give
us
some
citations
to
the...
to
the
regulations
or
whatever?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
ability...
obligation...
if...
if
she
comes
forward
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
benefit
only
riparian
property
owners
who
want
to
expand
their
facilities?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
a
haphazard
way
of...
of
assessing
a
benefit,
right,
when
you
want
to
expand
your
facilities,
since
we're...
we're
helping
you
on
the
flood
plain,
we're
going
to...
we're
going
to
make
you
dedicate...
only
if
you
want
to
expand
your
facilities.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
nexus
that's...
that
our
opinions
require
is...
is
not
a
nexus
to
whether
you're
benefitted
or
not.
it's
a
nexus
to
the...
the
permit
to
which
this...
this
exaction
is
attached.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
see
any
nexus
to
the
permit.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
fact
that
you're
benefitted
is
very
interesting,
but,
it
seems
to
me,
irrelevant
to
the
nexus
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
all,
just...
just...
you
really
think
that's...
that
nollan
said,
for...
suppose
the
city
is
worried
about
urban
congestion
and
pollution
and
someone
who
has
a
factory
wants
to...
wants
to
expand
it
infinitesimally,
just
a
very
little
bit.
can
the
state
require,
as
a
condition
of
that
permit,
a
million-dollar
contribution
to
the
city,
which
would
go
to...
to
pollution
reduction?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
serves
the
same
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
proportionality
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
can...
could
i
come
back
to
who
the
burden
is
on?
you
mean
that
a
municipality,
all
it
has
to
do
is
say,
you
know,
there
may
be
a
thimble
full
of
water,
we're
not
going
to
do
any
studies,
and
therefore,
we
want
10
percent
of
your
land
for
flood
control,
and...
and
the
burden
is
shifted
to
mrs.
dolan
to
do
a
study,
to
show
that
that
is
disproportionate?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
the
burden
be
on
her?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
you
mean
without
foundation?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
burden
on
the
city
to
demonstrate
some
rough
proportionality?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
shows
you're
in
the
same
general
ball
park,
flood
control.
but
why
doesn't
the
city
have...
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
it's
roughly
proportional?
that's
an
awful
burden
to
put
on
the...
on
the
small
individual
property
owner,
to
conduct
a
massive
study
to
demonstrate
that
the
city's
wrong.
all
the
city
has
to
say
is,
well,
flood
control
is
flood
control.
one
way
to
do
it
is
to...
is
to
not
expand
your
property.
another
way
to
do
it
is
to
give
us
10
percent
of
your
property
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
do
the
other
state
plans
that
you
referred
to
in
your
main
presentation...
new
jersey
and
elsewhere...
do
they
provide
for
some
proportionality?
