mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
city
of
tigard
avoided
denying
the
application
and,
instead,
granted
conditional...
the
conditional
approval
based
upon
mitigation
for
a
project
which
the
record
shows
would
add
hundreds
of
additional
automobile
trips
to
already
congested
streets
in
the
city,
and
which
would
place
a
building
of
several
thousand
square
feet
directly
in
the
path
of...
of
expected
flooding.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
yes,
there
was
a
payment
made--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--made
for...
it
is,
your
honor.
the
traffic
impact
fee,
however,
is
not
a
complete
offset
for
the
impacts
of
this
project.
that
issue
appears
for
the
first
time
in
the
briefs
at
this
level
of
review,
and
so
the...
the
ordinance
was
not
in
the
record.
we
have
lodged
it
with
the
court.
there
are
three
points
on
the
face
of
that
ordinance
that
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
a
complete
setoff.
first,
the
adoption
of
the
ordinance,
ordinance
379,
section
2,
says
specifically
it
is
not
intended
as
a
complete
setoff.
it's
intended
only
as
a
partial
solution
to
be
used
along
with
other
mechanisms
in
a
multifaceted
way
to
pay
for
transportation
improvements.
in
addition,
the
supporting
documentation,
adopted
at
the
same
time,
has
a
calculation
which
shows
only
21
percent
of
the
costs
expected
for
improving
streets
and
roads,
based
upon
impact,
is
covered.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
that
property
owner
would
also
be
expected
to
make
a
contribution
or
to
demonstrate,
in
the
language
of
our
comprehensive
plan,
that
there
are
adequate
public
facilities
and
services
available.
every
property
owner
in
the
city,
not
just
those
along
the
flood
plain...
not
just
those
along
the
bike
path,
must
satisfy
the
standards
of
7.1.2.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
it's
not--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--another
property
might
reconstruct
the
sidewalk.
another
property
might
contribute
to
the
synchronization
of
street
lights
in
order
to
provide
more
capacity
on
the
streets.
the
problem
the
city
was
facing
in
this
case
was
not
bringing
people
to
the
property
on
bikes.
the
problem
was
that
this
expansion...
major
expansion,
over...
close
to
double
the
size,
would
add
hundreds
of
additional
car
trips
to...
to
streets
that
were
already
so
congested
that
fire
vehicles--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--the
solution
was
to
offset
those
car
trips
by
an
alternative
system
of
transportation.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
no,
your
honor.
that's
not
the
basis
of
our
decision.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
your
honor,
the
relationship
is
that
this
project
is
a
retail
project
that
puts
additional
cars
on
the
road.
the
bike
path
is
mitigation
device
that
takes
trips
off
the
road.
they
don't
have
to
be
the
same
people.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
no,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
concept
is
that
the
city
is
trying
to
encourage
people
to
go
to
other
places
to
do
their
shopping
by
means
of
bicycle
rather
than
car.
if
they
can
achieve
that,
then
we
will
free
up
spaces
on
the
streets
for
those
people
who
are
coming
in
the
car
to
this
business.
this
is
not
a
radical
notion
or
a
particularly
innovative
notion.
it
is
an
idea
that
congress
has
legislated.
dollars
that--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--the
record--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--there
are
two
features
of
the
city's
code
which
i'd
like
to
describe,
which
i
believe
address...
address
your
question.
first,
every
property
owner
in
the
city
is
required
to
address
the
standard
of
providing
adequate
facilities
and
services,
and
that
standard
is
described
at
827
in
the
appendix.
and
to
paraphrase
it--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--that's
not
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
and
that's
the
second
point
i
wante
to
make
about
the
operation
of
the
code.
this
code
has
several
openings
for
property
owners
to
come
in
and
ask
for
adjustments.
and
the
key
one
is
the
variance
procedure,
which
says
specifically
you
may
have
a
variance
if
you
can
demonstrate
there's
no
adverse
effect
on
drainage
or
on
transportation.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
well,
your
honor,
if
they
cannot
prove
that
there
are
adequate
public
facilities
and
services,
they
would
be
conditioned
to
provide
them,
and
then
they
would
have
to
ask
for
a
variance.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
your
honor,
the...
the
upstream
property
owner,
the
uphill
property
owner,
would
also
have...
have
to
ask
for
a
variance
in
the
event
that
the
staff
sought
to
impose,
for
example,
a
bus
pullout
to
address
traffic
problems.
they
would
have--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
that
is
a
water
storage
facility.
at
page
four
of
our
brief,
at
footnote
four,
it
describes
that
you'd
have
to
do
a
study
of
the
drainage.
and
as
a
result
of
that
study
of
the
drainage,
you
would
be
required
to
build
a
storage
facility
for
the
runoff.
so,
the
way
the
system
works
is
that
those
who
are
next
to
the
creek
handle
the
problem
by
dedication,
and
then
the
city
comes
in
and
spends
the
money
to
build
the
storage
capacity.
the
balance
is
those
that
are
upstream
do
not
suffer
a
physical
invasion,
but
in
that
case,
they
have
to
build
on
their
own
land
the
storage
facility
with
their
own
money...
that's
the
balance.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
then
she
would
not
have
to
dedicate
the
land
for
the
greenway.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
she
did
have
that
option
and
did
not
choose
to
seek
it.
if
you
would
look
in
the
record,
your
honor,
at
page
e-4
of
our
appendix,
you
have
the...
a
copy
of
the
statement
of
justification
for
variance
filed
by
the
attorney...
the
then-attorney
for
the
dolans,
not
my
friend,
mr.
smith,
another
attorney.
and
there
you
can
see
that
they
made
no
serious
effort
at
all
to
try
to
say
either
that
they
were
going
to
provide
storage
facilities
or
that
there
wasn't
an
impact
from
this
project.
they
simply
didn't
take
advantage
of
the
system.
they
could
have.
they
could
have
come
in
with
a
design
that
showed
a...
a
large
catch
basin
under
their
parking
lot.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
your
honor,
that's
not
the
purpose
of
the
regulation,
as
can
be
seen
by
the
fact
that
if
you
don't
create
a
drainage
impact
you
would
not
have
to
dedicate.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
your
honor,
there
are
two
steps
in
this
process.
the
first
is
triggered
by
the
requirement
that
is
a
precondition
to
development.
you
do
a
site
development
study
that
would
analyze
the
impact
to
the
drainage.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
step
two
is
at
page
b-63
of
our
appendix.
and
that
is
subsection
(d)
of
section
18.160--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--d
as
in
dog.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
at
b-63.
and
here,
if
you're
study
shows
that--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--yes,
in
the
red
brief,
your
honor.
in
the
back,
there's
an
appendix.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
and
at
page
b
as
in
boy--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--boy,
63.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
yes.
there
is
a
code
provision,
d,
effect
on
downstream
drainage.
and
what
this
provision
says
is
if
you
are
going
to
create
additional
runoff
that
will
overload
the
existing
drainage
facility,
then
among
your
options
is
to
provide
for
storage
of
additional
runoff.
xx--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--the
reason
that...
that
it
wouldn't
work
for
an
applicant
to
come
in
and
say,
i
can
get
a
pipe
to
the
municipal
system,
is
that
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
comply
with...
with
policy
7.1.2,
which
says
you
must
provide
adequate
public
facilities.
if
there's
not
capacity
that's
sufficient
in
that
public
drainage
system
when
you
get
to
the
pipe
to
it,
then
you've
overloaded
it.
and
if
you've
overloaded
it,
you've
caused
a
harm
and
you
are
required
to
provide
additional
capacity.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
yes.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
it
is,
your
honor,
because
under
the...
the
policy
at
page
four,
mrs.
dolan
was
required
to
come
in
with
a
drainage
analysis.
she
didn't
do
that.
if
she
had
provided
a
drainage
analysis
that
said
we're
going
to
build
a
large
catch
basin
under
our
parking
lot
and
it
will
meter
the
water
out
slowly
at
the
same
rate
that
it
would
have
gone
out
if
there
was
no
building,
then
there
would
have
been
no
exaction.
she
would
have
gotten--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--yes.
the
findings
discuss
the
fact...
actually
discuss
one
of
the
other
options.
one
of
the
options
would
have
been
to
handle
the
traffic
impact
by
reconstructing
the
sidewalk
in
front.
there's
a
discussion
saying
that
if
she
reconstructed
the
sidewalk
and
the
street
that
that
would
be
a
possible
offset.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
yes.
but--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--no.
they're
required
to
make
other
contributions
to
the
transportation
system.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
not
unless
the
bike
path
goes
by
their
property.
they
might
contribute
by
building
a
sidewalk.
and
of
course
we
see
the
bike
path
and
the
sidewalk
system
as
one
integrated
system.
and
so--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--yes.
she--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--there
are
three
different
variance
procedures,
all
of
which
she
could
have
taken
advantage
of.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
on
the
variance
procedures,
your
honor?
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
i
don't
believe
the
opinion
mentions
them.
your--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--the...
the
argument
there
was
focused
on
the
test.
and...
and
so
that
issue
did
not
arise.
your
honor,
the
three
procedures
that
are
available
are,
first,
at
the
time
of
application,
you
can
come
into
the
process
and
say
there's
been
a
change
or
a
mistake
in
the
process,
or
there
are
special
attributes
to
my
property.
and
that
would
justify
a
change
in
the...
in
the
regulations
as
they're
applied.
the
second
provision
allows
that
the
city
engineer
can
adjust
the
regulations
based
upon
a
showing
that
there
are
sound
engineering
principles
allowing
it.
that
would
be
the
case,
for
example,
of
the
catch
basin
as
an
alternative
to
storage
capacity
in
the
creek.
and
then,
finally,
there's
the
formal
variance
process.
so...
and
the
variance
process
would
allow
variance
if
you
were
able
to
show
that
there's
no
adverse
effect.
so,
all
three
of
these
processes
are
available
to
adjust
the
conditions.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
yes,
your
honor.
she
could
have
come
in
with
alternative
solutions
to
the
traffic
impact
she
was
creating
and
to
the
runoff
impact.
unfortunately,
the
design
that
they
have
doesn't
do
that.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
yes.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
or
as
adequately.
in
other
words--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--well,
your
honor,
the
record
would
show
that
bike
paths
are
effective
as
mitigation.
because
they
draw
people
off
of
the
highways.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
well,
the
bike
path
is
actually
a
bike
and
pedestrian
path.
it's
designed
for
nonautomobile
transportation,
both
for
pedestrians
and
for
people
on
bicycles.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
i
believe
the
question
would
be...
i
believe
the
answer
is
no,
your
honor.
if
she
was
able
to
show
that
she
adequately
handled
the
traffic
impact,
then
we
could
not
impose
the
bike
requirement
if
she
had
some
other
mechanism.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
right.
the
decision
is
made
by,
in
the
first
instance,
the
planning
commission,
and
then,
on
appeal,
to
the
city
council.
under
the
law
in
oregon,
this
is
an
adjudicatory
process,
with
all
the
safeguards
of
an
impartial
decisionmaker,
a
decision
on
the
record,
a
decision
under
written
criteria.
that
decision
is
then
subject
to
review
by
the
land
use
board
of
appeals.
and
a
property
owner
such
as
this
one
can
introduce
evidence
at
that
trial
level
about
constitutional
violations
and
procedural
violations.
so,
there
was
a
second--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--that's--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
the
adjustment
criteria
are,
first,
the
variance
criteria
at
18.134.050,
which
appears
in
this
record
in...
in
my
brief
at
page
b-49.
second,
the
city
engineer's
ability
to
change
the
criteria
based
on
alternative
engineering
solutions--
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
--yes.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
if
she
comes
forward,
she
has
a
right
to
obtain
a
change
in
the
application
criteria.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
that
is
at
b-51
of
the
appendix,
section
18.164.020(b).
and,
finally,
the
consideration
of
change
or
mistake
or
positive
attributes
of
the
property
which
could
justify
change
is
at
b-7
of
the
appendix.
all
of
these
processes
are
available.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
and
all
of
them,
of
course,
would
be
decided
in
an
adjudicatory
procedure,
subject
to
review
on...
on
a
substantial
evidence
standard,
except
in
the
case
of
allegations
of
constitutional
violations.
mr.
timothy
v.
ramis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
