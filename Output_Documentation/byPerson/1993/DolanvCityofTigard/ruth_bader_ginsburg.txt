justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
1971,
the
supreme
court
decided
that
you
couldn't
make
arbitrary
distinctions
between
men
and
women
because
that
violated
the
rational
basis
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
it
was
no
test
at
all;
it
seemed
to
be
a
pretty
significant
test
in
the
case
of
reed
v.
reed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
formulate
that?
i
think
it
was
what
justice
o'connor
was
asking
you
earlier.
how
do
you
formulate
the
something
more?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
kind
of
a
submiddle
tier,
because
the
stock
formula,
equal
protection/due
process,
is
substantial
relationship
to
an
important
government
interest.
this
is
one
notch
down,
a
legitimate
government
interest.
it's
not
quite
as
heavyweight
as
an
important
government
interest,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
makes...
who
is
the
decisionmaker?
you...
you
said
that
she
could
propose.
she
doesn't
like
the
bike
path.
she
doesn't
like
your
plan.
she
can
come
up
with
an
alternative.
and
suppose
you
say
we,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
like
the
bike
path
better.
who
decides
and
what
review
is
there
of
that
decision?
