would
the
case
be
the
same
if
it
had
been
a
license
rather
than
an
easement?
justice
john
paul

in
other
words,
your
answer
is
yes?

at
least
it
was
in
my
first

course,

[laughter]
justice
john
paul

may
i...
may
i
raise
the
question
that
troubles
me
about
just
really
the
whole
case.
the
requirement
of
quantification,
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
be
awfully
difficult
to
meet
in
cases
in
which
a
municipality
might
perceive
a
danger
that
it
really
couldn't
evaluate,
but
feels
it
doesn't
want
to
take
the
risk.
say
out
in
california
you
worry
about
earthquakes.
you
don't
know
when
it's
going
to
happen
or
how
serious
it'll
be,
but
you
know
it's
a
possibility.
how
do
you
quantify
against
a
reasonable
risk
that
you
just
aren't
quite
sure
what'll
happen,
but
you
just
don't
want
to
take
any
chances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you've
acknowledged
they
could
deny
the
permit
outright
if
they
were
concerned
in
sort
of...
they
just
think
there's
a
danger
there,
but
they're
not
sure
they're
able
to
quantify
it.
i
think
you've
acknowledged
they
could
deny
the
permit
outright?
justice
stevens
but
you
say
they
can't
say,
well,
if
you
want
to
go
ahead
and
build,
because
we're
unsure
about
what's
happened,
we're
going
to
insist
that
you
make
these
perhaps
exaggerated
precautions?
you're
saying
they
can't
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
justice
blackmun
and
justice
ginsburg
have
joined
and
justice
souter
has
also
filed
a
dissent.
the
importance
of
the
case
consist
brief
oral
statement.
as
the
chief
justice
has
explained,
the
case
arises
out
of
a
request
for
a
permit
to
enlarge
the
tigard
unit
in
petitioner's
chain
of
hardware
stores.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
post
development
will
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
city's
legitimate
and
substantial
interest
in
controlling
drainage
in
fanor
creek
and
minimizing
traffic
congestion
in
tigard's
business
district.
that
impact
is
sufficient
to
justify
an
outright
denial
of
the
application
for
approval
of
the
expansion.
the
city
has
nevertheless
agreed
to
grant
dolan's
application
if
she
would
comply
with
two
conditions.
each
of
which
admittedly
will
mitigate
the
adverse
effect
of
her
proposed
development.
the
disputing
question
is
whether
the
city
has
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
by
refusing
to
allow
dolan's
planned
construction
to
proceed
unless
those
conditions
are
met.
in
answering
that
question,
the
court's
opinion
has
candidly
acknowledged
that
it
is
announcing
a
new
rule
of
law.
the
court
is
correct
in
concluding
that
the
city
may
not
attach
arbitrary
conditions
to
a
building
permit
or
to
a
variance
even
when
it
can
rightfully
deny
the
application
out
right.
it
could
not,
for
example,
insist
on
a
contribution
to
the
mayor's
campaign
in
exchange
for
a
permit.
on
the
other
had,
it
is
equally
clear
that
real
estate
developers
have
often
and
properly
have
been
required
to
dedicate
interest
in
property
to
the
public
to
help
provide
needed
roads,
parks,
or
schools,
or
to
otherwise
alleviate
some
of
the
problems
caused
by
the
proposed
use
of
their
land.
over
the
years,
a
substantial
body
of
state
law
has
developed
without
any
assistance
from
this
court.
today,
however,
this
court
has
decided
that
federal
judges
should
henceforth
play
an
important
role
in
an
area
which
we
have
traditionally
allowed
state
courts
the
greatest
deference.
i
should
just
mention
a
few
of
the
reasons
i
think
the
decision
is
misguided.
first,
by
imposing
on
the
local
government
the
burden
of
demonstrating
a
rough
proportionality
between
the
harm
caused
by
the
new
development
and
the
off
setting
benefit
obtained
from
a
required
dedication.
the
court
has
reversed
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
that
hereto
for
attach
the
state
actions
that
have
challenged
on
federal
constitutional
ground.
moreover,
in
its
analysis,
unlike
the
state
courts
that
have
dealt
with
similar
cases,
this
court
completely
ignores
the
benefit
that
the
property
owner
obtains
from
the
entire
transaction
and
narrowly
focuses
on
a
single
strand
the
so-called
power
to
exclude
of
the
bundle
of
rights
involved
in
the
development
of
commercial
property.
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
the
property
owner
is
not
defending
his
house
and
home
against
the
king's
intrusions
but
simply
attempting
to
maximize
his
profits
from
a
commercial
venture.
the
conditions
attached
to
the
development
are
a
species
of
commercial
regulation
that
should
be
entitled
to
the
strongest
presumption
of
constitutional
validity.
perhaps
even
more
important
in
the
court's
imposition
of
a
novel
burden
of
proof
on
cities
implementing
valid
comprehensive
land
use
plans
is
the
fact
that
the
court
has
implicitly,
not
expressly,
given
new
life
to
the
doctrine
of
substantive
due
process
as
a
basis
for
reviewing
state
regulation
of
commercial
property.
the
constitutional
text
that
provides
the
basis
for
its
holding
today
is
found
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
while
the
court
suggests
that
it
is
merely
applying
a
well-settled
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine
in
a
new
setting.
in
fact,
its
reasoning
is
reminiscent
of
the
court's
much-maligned
decision
in
lochner
against
new
york.
in
our
changing
world,
one
thing
is
certain.
uncertainty
that
characterize
predictions
about
the
impact
of
new
urban
developments
and
the
risks
of
floods,
earthquakes,
traffic
congestion,
or
environmental
harms.
when
there
is
doubt
concerning
the
magnitude
of
those
impacts,
the
public
interest
in
averting
them
should
outweigh
the
private
interest
of
the
commercial
entrepreneur.
if
the
government
can
demonstrate
that
the
conditions
it
has
imposed
in
a
land
use
permit
a
rational,
impartial,
and
conducive
to
fulfilling
the
aims
of
a
valid
land
use
plan
a
strong
presumption
of
validity
should
attach
to
those
conditions.
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
those
conditions
have
unreasonably
impaired,
the
economic
value
of
the
proposed
improvement
should
rest
squarely
on
the
shoulders
of
the
party
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
action.
that
allocation
of
burdens
has
served
as
well
in
the
past.
in
my
opinion,
the
court
has
stumbled
badly
today
by
reversing
it.
