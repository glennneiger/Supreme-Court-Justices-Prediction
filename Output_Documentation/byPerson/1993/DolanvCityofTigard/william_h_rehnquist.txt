chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
93-518,
florence
dolan
v.
the
city
of
tigard.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
far
as
the
finding
about
the
flood
plain
is
concerned,
there
was
a
finding
that
if
you
pave
over
with
asphalt
things
that
have
been
previously
green
or
growing
in
some
way,
you're
going
to
have
a
more
rapid
runoff.
now,
that...
that
doesn't
seem
very
speculative
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
the
city
has
to...
has
to
quantify
something
like
that,
do
some
sort
of
empirical
studies
that
would
show
the
portion
for
which
this
increase
in
her
usage...
or
her
increased
pavement
is
responsible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
there...
excuse
me...
isn't
there
some
sort
of
attenuation?
i
mean,
if
you're
three
miles
from
fanno
creek
and
pave
over
2,000
square
feet,
surely
it's
a
lesser
immediate
effect
on
the
creek
than
if
you
are
right
along
the
creek
and
pave
over
2,000
square
feet?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assuming
that
there
is
some
degree
of
proportionality,
do
you
insist
on,
you
know,
actual
empirical
demonstration
of
adverse
effects?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
specifically
in
this
case,
what
should
the
city
of
tigard
have
done
that
it
didn't
do
in
order
to
justify
the
demands
it
made
on
your
client
for
her
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
tigard
in
multnomah
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ramis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
that
the
upstream
property
owner
or
the
uphill
property
owner,
the
one
out
of
the
flood
plain
or
littoral,
he
wants...
he
wants
to
enlarge
his
business
the
same
way
that
mrs.
dolan
did,
would
the
city
demand
of
him
something
in
the
way
of
an
easement...
something
corresponding
to
the
flood
plain
easement
which
they
asked
of
mrs.
dolan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
something
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
b-63.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
didn't
rely
on
those
in
the
majority
opinion,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ramis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
benefits--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
there
something
in
the
record
that
indicates
that,
had
the
channel
not
been
widened
in
some
relatively
expectable
flood,
her
property
would
have
been
hurt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kneedler,
a
moment
ago
in
your
response
to
my
question
about
whether
there
was
a
showing
in
the
record
that
mrs.
dolan's
property
would
be
hurt
in
the
foreseeable
future,
you
referred
me
to
page
six--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
page
seven
has
a
finding
in
the
drainage
plan
that
there
would
be
flooding
in
several
areas
along
fanno
creek,
including
areas
near
petitioner's
property.
now,
does
page
eight
have
something
better
than
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
smith,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
cover
some
of
the
contentions
about
the
variances
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
didn't
consider
the
availability
of
variances,
and
they
were
not
argued
to
the
oregon
supreme
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
is
dolan
against
the
city
of
tigard.
in
here,
petitioner,
florence
dolan,
owns
a
plumbing
store
and
electric
supply
store
in
tigard,
oregon
which
is
the
suburb
of
portland.
she
applied
to
the
city
for
a
permit
to
redevelop
the
site
by
merely
doubling
the
size
of
her
current
store
in
paving
what
was
a
dirt
parking
lot.
the
city
planning
commission
conditioned
approval
of
her
application
on
her
dedication
of
some
of
her
land
to
the
city
first,
for
a
public
green-way
along
a
nearby
creek
to
minimize
flooding
hazards
that
would
be
enhanced
by
the
increases
and
run
off
associated
with
her
development,
and
second,
for
a
pedestrian
and
bicycle
pathway
intended
to
relieve
traffic
congestion
in
the
city's
central
business
district.
and
the
oregon
state
courts
upheld
this
action
of
the
city
planning
commission.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
oregon
supreme
court's
ruling.
while
we
find
that
a
connection
exists
between
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
city
planning
commission
and
the
impacts
of
the
proposed
development,
we
do
not
think
that
the
extent
of
the
exaction
demanded
and
by
the
permit
conditions
was
sufficiently
closely
related
to
the
projected
impact
of
the
proposed
development.
no
precise
mathematical
calculation
is
required
but
the
city
must
make
some
sort
of
individualized
determination
that
the
required
dedication
is
related
both
in
nature
and
extent
of
a
proposed
development's
impact
in
order
to
avoid
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment's
prohibition
against
the
taking
of
private
property
without
compensation.
here,
the
city
has
never
said
why
a
public
as
opposed
to
a
private
green-way
is
required
in
the
interest
of
flood
control
and
it
has
not
shown
in
any
charical
way
how
the
bicycle
paths
relates
to
the
petitioner's
increase
of
her
business
area.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon.
