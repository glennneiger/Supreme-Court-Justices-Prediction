mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address,
first,
just
one
factual
point
about
the...
or
i
guess
policy
point
about
the
flood
plain.
the...
the
legitimacy
of...
of
the
flood
plain
approach
taken
by
the
city
here
has
been
addressed
thus
far
only
in
terms
of
the
adverse
impacts
that
would
be
caused
by
increasing
the
impervious
surface
on
the...
on
the
parking
lot
and
expanding
the
building.
and
petitioner
suggests
that
the
condition
imposed
on
mrs.
dolan
should
be
proportional
to
that
adverse
impact.
that
is
one
measure,
and
it's
true
the
city's
flood
plain...
excuse
me...
drainage
plan
does
identify
that
measure
as
one
method
of
allocating
the
cost.
but
there
is
another
important
consideration,
and
that's
the
benefit
to
mrs.
dolan.
she
is
right
along
the
flood
plain.
and
the
city's
drainage
plan
estimates
that,
absent
some
improvements
in
the
drainage
channel,
because
of
development
all
along
the
flood
plain,
the
flood
level
will
rise
two
to
five
feet,
with
a
40
percent
increase
in
the
amount
of
water
during
the
100-year
flood
plain...
flood...
typical
flood.
and
so
the
improvement
of
the
channel
confers
considerable
benefits
on
the
property
owners
immediately
adjacent
to
the
creek.
and
in...
in
designing
what
sorts
of
conditions
should
be
imposed--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
will
prevent
the...
will
prevent
the...
the
plan
is
to
widen
the
channel
and
to
reinforce
the
slopes,
so
that
the
channel
will
have
a
greater
carrying
capacity
in
large
floods.
with
a
greater
carrying
capacity,
the
water
will
be
carried
past
her
property.
otherwise,
it
would...
it
would
rise
and
go
onto
her
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
this
is
addressed
on
page
six
of
the
respondent's
brief.
the
channel
has
not
yet
been
built,
but
this
is
the
projection
of...
of
what
would
be
necessary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
one...
one
of
the
important
aspects
of
flood
plain
reg...
flood
plain
regulation
came
in
about
20
years
ago.
and...
and
realistically,
flood
plain
regulation
often
has
to
take
something
of
a
given
what's
already
there,
but...
but
to
attach
conditions
on
expanding
what
is
already
there.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
i...
and
that's
the
next
point
i
wanted
to
get
to.
i
just
wanted
to
make
the
point
that
it
is
appropriate
for
a
municipality,
in
deciding
what
conditions
to
attach,
to
take
into
account
the
unique
characteristics
of
the
land.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke.
it's
page
eight.
i'm
sorry.
page
eight
of
the
red
brief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
immediately...
immediately
adjacent...
adjacent
to
the
indentation
on
page
eight,
it
says
upstream
of
hall
boulevard,
which
is
the
stretch
where
her
property
is
located.
the
flood
stage
reductions
that
would
result
from
widening
the
channel
will
reduce
the
flood
range
from
two
to
five
feet
over
the
next
years.
i
would
like
to
address
the...
the
test,
though.
as...
as
we
understand
this
court's
decision
in
nollan,
the
test
is
really
one
of
whether
the
permit
condition
serves
the
same
purpose
as
an
outright
denial.
it's
taken
as
a
given
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
petitioner's
concession
that
the
permit
could
have
been
denied
outright.
so,
what...
what
this
court
said
in
nollan
is
that
it
agreed
with
the
state's
contention
there
that
if
the
permit
condition
serves
the
same
purpose
as
an
outright
denial
would
have
done,
that...
that
the
condition
can
be
imposed.
that's
all
the
court
required.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
as--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
we
suggested
in
our
brief,
if
the...
if...
and,
in
fact,
respondent
seems
to
agree
with
this
at
page
19
of
our
reply
brief,
with
our
formulation,
which
is
if...
if
the
landowner
can
show
that
the
conditions
being
imposed
is
wholly
out
of
relation
to
the...
to
the
adverse
impact--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but...
we
think
not
in
its
own
right.
but
it
goes
to
a
measure...
it
goes
to
determining
whether
this
is
ultimately
a
land
use
regulation,
as
opposed
to
serving
some
other
purpose.
in
nollan,
the
court
articulated
the
question
as
whether
the
condition
serves
the
same
purpose.
and
the
court
there
concluded
the
condition
did
not.
because
it
did
not
serve
the
same
purpose,
the
court
said
it
converted
what
was
a
legitimate
land
use
regulation
into
something
else.
and
we
think
that
the
same
principle
might
well
apply
by
virtue
of
gross
disproportionality
or
no
relation,
it
would
convert
land
use
regulation
to
something
that's
not.
it's
really
a
question
of
subterfuge
or
something
in
the
nature
of
pretext...
is
what
the
city
is
trying
to
do
something
other
than
land
use
regulation?
but
where
that's
not
present,
conditions
serving
the
same
purpose
as
a
permit
denial
are...
are
not
something
that
are
inherently
suspect,
but
in
fact
are
to
be
encouraged.
they...
they
discourage...
otherwise,
a
city
could
be
encouraged
to
deny
permits
all
the
time,
and
have
a
right
land
use
regulation
scheme.
but
permit
conditions
that
serve
the
same
purpose
as
the
ultimate
denial
might
afford
flexibility
to
both
sides.
the
city
has
ways
in
which
to
promote
its
environmental,
its
flood
control,
its
traffic
problems,
and
the
landowner
can
dedicate
an
easement
and
get
on
with
the
work
on
his
or
her
own
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that...
that's
correct.
it's
an
outer
limit
or...
or
a
touchstone
for
determining
whether
the
same
purpose
should
be
served.
and
this
is...
this
is
not
a...
a
principle
unique
to
this
court's
takings
jurisprudence,
it
applies--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
in...
in
our
view,
the
word
"substantial"...
substantially
advancing
a
governmental
purpose...
to
the
extent
it
means
something
other
than
a
reasonable
relationship,
we
think
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
the
overall
regulatory
scheme
furthers
a
governmental
interest.
and
if
the
permit
denial
would...
would
further...
would
substantially--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
nollan
does...
does...
if
we
take
as
a
given
that
the
permit
denial
would
substantially
further
the
governmental
interest,
and
if
the
permit
condition
serves
the
same
purpose,
it's
lesser
included,
and
therefore
would
substantially
further
the
same
purpose.
we
think
that
that...
that
that
would...
that
that
would
ordinarily
follow
as...
as
a
matter
of
course.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--correct.
correct.
and
this
question
of...
of
relevance
or
germaneness
is
a
principle
this
court
has
applied
in
a...
in
a
number
of
situations
where...
where
conditions
are
attached
to
expenditure
of
governmental
funds
or
other
governmental
programs.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right...
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
inquire
into
the
actual
subjective
motivation.
but
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
pretext
inquiry.
as
the
court
said,
again,
in...
in
nollan,
if
it
serves
a
different
purpose,
it
converts
the
land
use
regulation
to
something
else.
and
that's
where
we
think
proportionality
does
enter
into
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
city...
the
city
can't
just
assert
that
with...
without
foundation,
i
think.
but
that's
not
at
all
what
happened
here.
it's
typical
for
congress,
for
agencies,
for
cities--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what
the
city
did
was
to
adopt
a
code
of
general
applicability,
which...
which
states,
for
example,
that...
that
increasing
impervious
surfaces
will
increase
runoff
and
increase
flooding,
as
one
example.
and
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
landowner
to
say
that
this
condition
will
not...
will
not
further
the
same
purpose.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
question
is
not
principally
one
of
quantification,
but
logical
relatedness
of
the
condition
to
the...
to
the
impact
being
addressed.
