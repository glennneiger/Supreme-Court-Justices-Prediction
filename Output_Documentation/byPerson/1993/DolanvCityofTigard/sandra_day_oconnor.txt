justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
city
require
an
easement
or
the
fee
to
this
area?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
but
you
say
the
record
as
it
comes
to
us
shows
the
requirement
of
dedication
of
the
fee
title
to
this
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
did
the
city
also
require
mrs.
dolan
to
construct
the
bike
path
at
her
expense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
you
articulate
such
a
test
in...
in
simple
terms?
what
would
you
say
the
test
is
that
you
think
this
court
has
or
should
impose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
you
can't
do
it,
how
do
you
expect
us
to?
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
smith,
is
there
any
difference,
do
you
think,
in
the
justification
the
city
can
offer
for
the
flood
control
problem
and
the
justification
for
the
bike
path,
insofar
as
mrs.
dolan's
property
is
concerned?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me,
i
can't
find
what
you're
talking
about.
is
that
something
in
the
red
brief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
b
as
in
boy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
you
haven't
overloaded
it,
then
there's
no
such
problem
or
requirement,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
a
possibility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
isn't
a
possibility
for
mrs.
dolan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
what
about
the
bike
path?
did
she
have
an
option
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
no
bike
path?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
how
about
other
property
owners
that
are
not
adjacent
to
the
creek,
are
they
required
to
build
a
bike
path?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
never
a
bike
path?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
said
she
could
have
an
alternative
by
providing
a
sidewalk.
now,
that
wouldn't
provide
bike
space
at
all.
that's
for
people
to
walk
on--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
seems
to
kind
of
ignore
the
word
"substantial"
in
the
test
articulated
in
nollan.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
hadn't
read
it
that
way,
but
i
guess
that's
a
way
one
could
read
it.
