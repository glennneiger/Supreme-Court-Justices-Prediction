mr.
david
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
government
may
demand
the
dedication
of
real
property
as
a
condition
of
development
approval,
without
showing
that
there
is
a
reasonably
proportional
relationship
between
the
dedication
and
the
actual
adverse
impacts
of
the
development.
in
the
case
that
we
have
today,
the
city
of
tigard
demanded
that
mrs.
dolan
dedicate
10
percent
of
her
real
property,
and
the
city
did
that
without
showing
any
proportional
relationship
whatsoever.
we
submit
that
the
failure
of
the
city
in
requiring
that
dedication
to
show
the
proportional
relationship
violates
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
because
it
takes
private
property
from
her
for
public
use,
without
payment
of
just
compensation.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
would
agree
that
the
city
would
have
been
within
its
authority
to
deny
the
permit
outright.
however,
that...
that
of
course
might
raise
a
different
takings
question
that's
outside
the
realm
of
dedications
and
municipal
exactions,
and
not
only
that,
that...
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
and
one
of
the
problems
that
we
have
is
if...
if
all
that
is
required
in
a
threshold
inquiry
for
dedication
to
meet
constitutional
muster
is
that
the...
the
government
could
have
denied
the
permit
outright,
and
never
reach
the
question
of
whether
there
is
the
essential
nexus
or
the
requisite
proportionality,
then
there
is
really
no
textual
meaning
that
i
believe
is
given
to
this
court's
opinion
in
nollan,
and
there
is
no
fulfillment
of
the...
the
mandate
in
armstrong
v.
united
states,
that
individuals
should
not
be
singled
out
to
bear
public
burdens
that,
in
all
fairness
and
justice,
should
be
borne
by
the
public
as
a
whole.
the...
the
city
really
demanded
mrs.
dolan's
land
because
it
wanted
it
for
free,
to
fulfill
its
longstanding
plans
for
park...
for
a
park
and
for
a
pedestrian
and
bicycle
pathway.
and
it
did
that
without
any
regard
to
the
actual
impacts
of
her
new
store.
the
city's
so-called
findings
in
this
case
were
made
up
after
the
fact,
and
were
mere
speculation
and
conjecture.
and
the
city--
mr.
david
b.
smith
--mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
indeed
common
sense
to
tell
us
that
if
one
increases
the
amount
of
a
per...
impervious
surface
on
a
piece
of
property,
that
there
will
indeed
be
more
runoff.
we
would
certainly
agree
with
that.
however,
the
problem
is...
and
i
think
this
was
well
pointed
out
by
justice
peterson
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below...
that
there
was
never
a
quantification
of
exactly
how
much
water
would
run
off.
and
as
justice
peterson
characterized
it
in
his
dissent,
how
much,
a
thimble
full?
in
the
absence
of
any
quantification
of
the
amount
of
water
that
would
actually
run
off
of
a
site,
and
comparing
that
to
the
overall
amount
of
water
that
could
run
off
from
other
structures
throughout
the
city
that
increased
impervious
surface,
there
is
really
no
way
for
the...
the
city
to
come
up
with
a
fair
apportionment
of
the...
of
the
cost
that
should
be
imposed
on
mrs.
dolan.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
the
city
itself
recognized
that
that
was
the
way
to
go.
that,
in
the
record
that's
before
this
court,
at
docket
number
f,
at
pages
810
and...
and
811,
it
shows
that
the
city,
in
the
detailed
study
it
did
of
storm
water
runoff,
that
its
consultant
commended
to
the
city
and
urged
the
city
to
do
a
calculation
on
the
total
amount
of
impervious
surface
that
would
occur
within
the
city
at
buildout,
and
as
the
people
proposed
development,
they
should
calculate
the
specific
development's
contributions
to
that
impervious
surface
and
to
use
that
relative
fraction
to
apportion
cost.
mr.
david
b.
smith
no,
justice
scalia,
there
is
not.
mr.
david
b.
smith
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that,
in
fact,
there
are
a
number
of
properties
that
are
not
located
on
fanno
creek
itself
in
the
city
of
tigard
that
in
fact
may
generate
more
storm
water
runoff
than
mrs.
dolan's
proposed
new
store.
but,
in
fact--
mr.
david
b.
smith
--yes,
your
honor,
we
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
and
the
reason
is,
is
that
the
city
has
already
established
regulatory
restrictions
on
what
can
go
on
inside
that
100-year
flood
plain.
and
the
dolans
are
already
prohibited
from
engaging
in
developmental
uses
of
that
100-year
flood
plain.
and
considering
the
geography
in
question,
it
is
highly
unlikely
that...
that
anything
could
go
on
either.
it's
a
very,
very
steep
bank.
so,
the
fact
of
the
matter
remains
is
there
is
no
development
that's
going
to
go
on
within
the
100-year
flood
plain.
it
couldn't
go
on
within
the
100-year
flood
plain.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor,
that
is
part
of
the...
the
flood
plain.
what
the
city
required
was
the
dedication
of
all
land
within
the
100-year
flood
plain
for
a
greenway
to
fulfill
its
plan
to
link
up
a
network
of
parks,
both
upstream
and
downstream.
in
addition,
they
required
the
dedication
of
a
15-foot
wide
strip
immediately
adjacent
and
east
of
the
boundary
of
the
flood
plain
for
construction
of
a
pedestrian
and
bicycle
pathway.
which,
incidentally,
would
increase
impervious
surface
in
and
of
itself.
and
also,
for
the
site
of
a...
the
construction
of
a
future
storm
drain
that
the
city
contemplated
establishing
in
the
future.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
smith
--i
don't
believe
that
the
regulatory
impositions
that
were
imposed
on
mrs.
dolan
for
maintaining
open
space
and
vegetated
area
on
her
property
were
unreasonable.
and
we
in
fact
did
not
challenge
those
below
and
do
not
do
so
before
this
court
today.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor,
what
has
occurred
now
is
that
she
may
not
construct
her
larger
store
and
demolish
her
old
store
until
such--
mr.
david
b.
smith
--your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
non-developmental
uses
to
which
she
could
have
put
the
land
in
the
greenway,
which
might
have
added
value
and
amenity
to...
to
her
larger
store.
she
could
have,
for
example,
put
in
landscaping
within
the
greenway
that
would
have
made
her
site
more
attractive,
without
violating
the
restrictions
that
the
city
had
already
placed
upon
her
regarding
development
of
that
land.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor,
the
public
does
not
have
access
to
the
lan...
to
mrs.
dolan's
land
at
this
time,
with
the
exception
of
the
access
for
her
business.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
smith
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor,
the...
the
city
in
its
actual
findings
required
the
dedication
of
a
fee.
the
city
has
represented
in
its
brief
that
what
it
was
really
going
to
ask
for
was
merely
an
easement.
that
is
not
contained
in
their
explicit
findings.
and
as
we
noted
in
our
reply
brief,
that
even
if
they
were
to
only
require
an
easement,
there
would
still
be
an
undue
burden
upon
her.
because
as
was
noted
by
justice
scalia,
she
would
still
have
the
burden
of
having
the
public...
the
uninvited
public,
pass
to
and
fro.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
city's
findings
require
dedication.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor,
the
city's
findings
at
the
petition
for
cert
at
appendix
g...
at
page
g-28,
specifically
require
the
construction.
however,
the
city
has
noted
and
has
in
fact
submitted
additional
materials
to
this
court
that
would
show,
when
mrs.
dolan
made
her
first
application...
and
this
appeal
is
brought
from
a
second
application...
that
the
city
had
in
fact
decided
not
to
require
her
to
construct
the
pathway.
however,
when
the
findings
came
out
with
regard
to
the
second
application,
the
findings
had
it
back
in
there
again.
so,
as
the
record
is
before
this
court
today,
there
was
a
requirement
to
construct
the
bike
path.
mr.
david
b.
smith
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
nollan
was
merely
the
conveyance
of
an
easement.
and
we
do
not
rest
our
case
on
the
distinction
between
dedication
of
fee
and
easement.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
it
is,
well
recognized
in
law.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor,
i
believe
that
if
the...
the
requirement
had
been
that
that
license
mandated
the
continuous
passage
of
the
public,
it
would
have
been
just
as
burdensome
an
imposition
upon
mrs.
dolan
as
was
the
beach
easement
was
on
mr.
and
mrs.--
mr.
david
b.
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
david
b.
smith
i
believe
that
justice
stevens
says
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
and
i
would
defer
to
his
judgment.
[laughter]
mr.
david
b.
smith
if
i
could
turn
again...
once
again
to
the
issue
of
proportionality,
i
think
that
one
of
the
important
points
to
be
noted
in
this
case
is
that
if
there
had
been
a...
a
clear
understanding
on
the
part
of
the...
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
and
the
city
of
tigard
that
there
was
a
requirement
for
proportionality
embedded
within
this
court's
1987
decision
in
nollan
v.
california
coastal
commission,
that
the
outcome
of
the
case
might
have
been
significantly
different.
this
court,
within
nollan,
used
words
like
"specific
connection",
"precise
fit"
was
used
in
the
dissent,
"essential
nexus".
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
construed
those
to
mean
that
there
really
only
needed
to
be
some
sort
of
rational
relationship
between
the
dedications
and
the
adverse
impacts.
and,
therefore,
hypothetical
impacts...
and
i
would
stress
that...
that
the
impacts
that
were
found
by
the
city
in
this
case
were
really
very,
very
speculative...
that
that
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
city
of
tigard,
and
in
fact
satisfy
the
majority
of
the
oregon
supreme
court.
i
don't
believe
that...
that
proportionality,
as
it
has
been
characterized
by
the
city
in
its
brief,
is
indeed
a
revolutionary
concept.
in
fact,
the
emerging
weight
of
authority
across
the
united
states
in
the
various
states
recognizes
that
a
proportionality
test
is
in
fact
the
one
that
should
be
used
in
looking
at
the
relationship
between
dedications.
mr.
david
b.
smith
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
i
believe
that
would
be
unreasonable.
and
the
emerging
weight
of
authority
among
the
states
is
adopting
a
similar
position
there.
as
you
know,
and
as
is
well
laid
out
in
the
washington
legal
foundation's
amicus
brief
to
this
court,
they
discussed
the
old
illinois
test,
which
was
specifically
and
uniquely
attributable.
and
in
fact,
the
weight
of
authority
has
moved
away
from
that
and
is
requiring
some
sort
of
rough
proportionality
based
on
actual
impacts,
with
some
sort
of
temporally
present,
contemporaneous
relationship
that's
substantially
and
demonstrably
clear.
and
i
believe
that
that
test,
far
being
from
revolutionary,
is
the
one
that
is
coming
out.
it's
in
the
so-called
new
jersey
test
that
was
established
in
longwood
in
1968.
it's
in
the
wisconsin
test
that
was
established
in--
mr.
david
b.
smith
--justice
o'connor,
it's
difficult
to
articulate
the
test
in
simple
terms,
mostly
because
the...
the
courts
across
the
country...
the
state
courts...
have
not
chosen
to
use
simple
terms.
mr.
david
b.
smith
i
would
submit
that
to
find
proportionality,
that
there
are
about
three
things
that
need
to
be
done.
first
of
all,
there
needs
to
be
some
sort
of
actual,
specific
quantification
of
impacts
and
of
public
needs,
much
as
was
described
in
the
city
of
tigard's
record
and
how
their
consultant
thought
that
they
ought
to
approach
storm
water
runoff.
after
that
quantification
is
done,
i
believe
that
there...
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
proportional
relationship
that
establishes
the
contribution
of
an
individual
development
project
to
the
overall
need.
and,
finally,
where
a
dedication
of
real
property
is
required,
i
think
that
needs
to
be
quantified
and
compared
against
that...
that
fraction
or
that
relationship.
mr.
david
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the...
the
first
instance,
what
the
city
should
have
done
is
they
should
have
quantified
the
actual
storm
water
runoffs
that
had...
were
going
to
occur
from
the
17,600-square-foot
building.
that
they
never
did.
there
is
quantification
of
the
overall
increase
in
impervious
surface,
the
overall
demand
citywide
when
it
goes
to
buildout,
but
no
specific
assessment
of
what
this
project
would
do.
mr.
david
b.
smith
justice
stevens,
in
that
instance,
i
believe
that
what
would
occur
would
not
be
a
dedication
of
real
property
as
some
sort
of
permit
condition,
but
in
fact
would
be
a
regulatory
restriction
upon
development
as
regularly
happens
within
100-year
flood
plains,
geologic
hazard
areas.
and
based
on
this
court's
lucas
decision--
mr.
david
b.
smith
--yes,
your
honor,
we
have.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor,
if
the
exaggerated
precautions
involve
the
dedication
of
an
interest
in
real
property,
i
believe
that
it
is
incumbent
on
the
government,
in
order
to
fulfill
this
court's
requirements
laid
down
in
1960
in
armstrong,
that
it
do
more
than
merely
speculate
or
hypothesize.
i
think
they
need
to
look
at
the...
the
real
impacts
and
come
up
with
a
quantification.
otherwise,
the
alternative
is
to
prohibit
it
outright.
then
we
have
a...
a
lucas
v.
the
south
carolina
coastal
council
question
that
arises,
as
to
whether
it
is
in
fact
a
common
law
nuisance.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor,
we
would...
we
believe
that...
that
the
rational
basis...
or
rational
relationship
test,
if
we
should
call
it
that,
as
it
was
applied
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
and
was
applied
by
the
city
of
tigard,
is
in
fact
no
test
at
all.
and
that
in
fact
proportionality
is
essentially
the
antithesis
of
that
test.
i
believe
rational...
rational
basis
is
much
more
akin
to
the
sort
of
rational
basis
review
that
goes
on
in
due
process
and
equal
protection
context,
and
in
fact
is
willing
to
rely
upon
even
the
most
remote
and
hypothetical
of
state
interests.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
smith
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
and
i
would
believe
that
within
the...
the
context
of
the
review
of
legislation,
that
the
rational
basis
review,
as
it
has
been
applied
by
this
court,
in
fact
is...
works
quite
well
within
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
context.
however,
i
believe
as
this
court
observed
in
nollan,
that
when
one
is
involved
with
the
dedication
of
interests
in
property,
that
something
more
than
the
rational
basis
review
necessarily
needs
to
be
applied.
mr.
david
b.
smith
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that,
as
this
court
set
forth
in
nollan,
that
it
said
that
what
was
required
was
a
substantial
advancement
of
legitimate
state
interests;
that
that
substantial
advancement
test
is
in
fact
given
context
and
given
substance
by
virtue
of
a
requirement
for
proportionality.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
with
regard
to
flood
control,
the
city
did,
and
it
is
in
the
record
before
this
court,
an
extensive
study
that
documented
what
would
be
the
storm
water
runoff
when
all
of
the
vacant
land
in
the
city
had
been
built
up
and
had
the
maximum
amount
of
impervious
surface.
with
regard
to
transportation...
but
that's
all
they
did.
okay.
with
regard
to
transportation,
the
city
relied
upon
its
parent
county
traffic
impact
ordinance.
and
that
traffic
impact
ordinance
quantifies
not
only
the
overall
needs
of
the
community,
but
quantified
the
specific
impacts
that
would
be
generated
out
of
this...
this
larger
site,
with
the
increased
number
of
parking
spaces
and
trips
per
day.
mr.
david
b.
smith
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
tigard
is
in
washington
county,
which
is
right
next
to
multnomah
county.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
fact,
with
regard
to
the
traffic
impact
fee
that
was
assessed
on
mrs.
dolan,
14,000-and-some-odd
dollars,
that's
exactly
what
the
city
did.
mr.
david
b.
smith
in
the
city
of
tigard,
your
honor,
the...
the
snapshot
was
taken
in
1983,
when
the
city's
comprehensive
plan
was
adopted.
and
that
snapshot
evaluated
the
amount
of
impervious
surface
that
was
within
the
fanno
creek
watershed
at
that
time.
and
it
then
looked
at
the
allowable
zoning
that
was
provided
for
within
the
fanno
creek
basin,
and
looked
at
how
much
impervious
surface
could
increase
after
that,
until
the
basin
got
to
buildout.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
chief
justice,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i--
mr.
david
b.
smith
--yes,
justice
scalia.
and
that
was
1983
in
this
case.
mr.
david
b.
smith
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the...
on
the
matter
of
a
variance,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
city
to
establish
a
requirement
for
the
dedication
of
real
property
and
thrust
upon
the
private
property
owner
the
unreasonable
demand
that
in
order
to
escape
from
having
to
surrender
a
fee
title
or
an
easement
to
the
government,
it
is
necessary
for
them
to
go
through
a
variance
procedure
in
order
to
get
out
from
under
what
would
otherwise
be
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
private
property.
mr.
david
b.
smith
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
there
were
such
alternatives.
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
supports
that
contention.
and
i
have
noted
in
appendix
g
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
at
page
g-12
and
g-14,
two
recitations
that
i
think
belie
my
distinguished
colleague's
representation
that
they
do.
this...
and
i
quote
here
from
pages
g-11
and
g-12,
where
the
city,
in
its
findings,
said,
it
appears
to
be
impractical
to
perform
the
proposed
reconstruction
of
main
street
on
a
piecemeal
fashion,
on
a
lot-by-lot
basis.
therefore,
we
do
not
propose
that
any
reconstruction
of
main
street
be
required
as
a
condition
of
approval
of
this
development
proposal.
similarly,
at
page
g-14,
the
city
says,
requiring
surface
water
quality
facilities
on
small
sites,
which
certainly
one
and
two-thirds
acres
is,
could
result
in
numerous
facilities
that
could
become
a
maintenance
burden
on
the
city.
furthermore,
the
applicant
does
not
propose
any
such
facilities,
and
there
are
no
natural
depressions
or
other
areas
of
this
site
that
are
particularly
suitable
for
water...
water
quality
features.
i
think
that...
that
answers
both
questions
as
to
whether
the
city
honestly
believed
that
mrs.
dolan
could
have
avoided
the
dedications
by
engaging
in
either
improvements
to
main
street
or
the
establishment
of
an
onsite
water
quality
impoundment
facility.
mr.
david
b.
smith
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would...
would
make
one
more
point
about
proportionality.
and
that
is,
very
essentially,
that
unless
there
is
some
requirement
for
proportionality
between
actual
impacts
and
dedications,
that
even
the
most
strenuous
of
dedications
could
have
been
required.
the
city
could
have
found
that
mrs.
dolan's
new
store
would
have
increased
traffic
by
one
additional
vehicle
trip
per
day.
in
the
absence
of
proportionality,
the
city
could
have
required
her
to
dedicate
75,
95
percent
of
her
land
for
a
widening
of
main
street.
no
proportionality.
we
have
our
rational
relationship.
the
city
gets
it.
and
there's
no
fairness.
there's
no
justice.
and
what
this
court
said
in
armstrong
has
no
meaning
at
all.
mr.
david
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
and,
in
fact,
there
is
at
least
one
state
that
i
am
told...
the
state
of...
i
believe
it's
virginia...
that
even
requires
the
old
illinois
test
and
requires
even
a
heightened
degree
of
proportionality
that
puts
an
extreme
burden
on
government.
and
it's
noteworthy
that...
that
both
the
new
jersey
and
wisconsin
tests
were
adopted
in
the
1960's,
well
before
this
court
established
its
ruling
in
nollan,
and
they
have
worked
quite
well.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
