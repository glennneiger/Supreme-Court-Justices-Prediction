assume
that
the
additional
runoff
would
require
that
some
vegetation
remain
alongside
of
the
creek.
is
it
your
position
that
the
demands
of
the
city
are
nevertheless
excessive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
we
hear
about
the
greenway,
is
that
simply
part
of
the
bike
path,
of
is
that
also
part
of
the
flood
plain?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
it
be
your
position
that
if
vegetation
must
be
there,
assuming
there
is
some
additional
runoff
and
there
is
a
relation
between
that,
that
you're
entitled
to
keep
vegetation
that's
other
than
what
would
be
in
the
greenway?
i
mean,
is
this
an
excessive
demand,
so
far
as
the
city
is
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
all
they
ask
is
grass.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
mrs.
dolan
said
that
she
was
willing
to
build
a
storage
facility?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
she
given
that...
was...
did
she
have
that
option?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
in
all
events,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
unnecessary
for
the
drainage
that
the
property
owner
lose
the
right
to
exclude
the
public
from
access
to
it.
i
see
no
relation
between
those
two.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
representation
to
us
that
mrs.
dolan
had
all
of
the
options
of
an
uphill
property
owner?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if...
if
she
had
an
alternative
that
was
equally
mitigating
to
the
bike
path,
would
your
city
have
the
right
to
insist
on
the
bike
path
because
it
preferred
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
are
these
tests
relevant
to
an
ultimate
determination
of
whether
what
the
city
is
doing
is
simply
a
pretext
for
furthering
its
own
goals
that
do
not
proportionally
relate
to
the
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
availability
of
conditions...
of...
of
alternatives
that
she
could
have
invoked
and
that
the
city
would
have
had
to
accept
as
a
matter
of
right?
