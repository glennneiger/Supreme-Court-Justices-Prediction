mr.
smith,
are
you
going
to
comment
on
the
question
of
whether
the
city
would
have
been
within
its
rights
to
deny
the
building
permit
entirely?
justice
david
h.
souter
we...
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
city
could
have
denied
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what...
what...
what
could
she
do
then
that
she
cannot
do
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
my
question
was
imprecise.
i'm
sorry.
on
the...
on
the...
the
greenway
area,
the
flood
plain,
which
is
subject
to
the
easement,
she
couldn't
develop
it
before...
what
is
it
that
she
wanted
to
do
that
she
cannot
do
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
smith,
i
don't
want
to
be
picky;
i
think
i'm
going
to
sound
that
way,
though.
i
don't...
i
still
do
not
grasp
your...
your...
your
substantial
relationship
as
a
basis
for
your
proportionality
test.
are
you
saying,
in
effect,
that
you
basically
make
a
fraction...
let's
say
on
the
runoff
problem...
that
you
make
a
fraction
of
the
amount
of
runoff
that's
going
to
be
created
by
this
change
in
use
of
the
property,
with
that
created
by
the
change
of
use
in
the
property
as
your
numerator
and
all
the
other
unnatural
runoff
that
is
going
to
hit
this
creek
as
your
denominator,
to
start
with?
and
then,
you,
in
effect,
say
that
fraction
governs
the...
the
portion
of
the
cost
of
improving
the
creek
that
can
be
borne
by
this
landowner?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
you
go...
how
do
you...
how
do
you
determine
what
your
denominator
is?
do
you
go
back
to
the
point
where...
before
the
land
was
settled,
and
you
figure
all
of
the
runoff
that
is
now
taking
place
that
wouldn't
have
taken
place
if
this
were
just
grassland
or
woodland
or
whatever
it
would
have
been?
or
do
you...
do
you
start
with
some
baseline,
the
year
1990,
and
you
measure
incremental
runoff
from
that
point
on?
how...
how,
in
practice,
does
it
work?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
it
would
be
the
amount
of
legitimate
increase
that
could
be
projected
from
'83,
as
the
denominator,
and
the
portion
of
that
attributable
to
this
change
in
use
as
the
numerator?
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
ramis--
--are
you
judging
the...
the
obligation
of
the
littoral
property
owners
and
the
nonlittoral
owners
by
contradictory
standards?
because
you're
saying
that...
excuse
me...
in
answer
to
an
earlier
question,
that
the...
the
owner
of
property
two
blocks
away
from
the
creek
would
be
judged
by...
by
asking
whether
the...
the
public
facilities
that
would
be
burdened
by
the...
by
the
building
were
already
adequate;
whereas
you
have
made,
as
i
understand
it,
a
definitive
determination
with
respect
to
the
littoral
property
owners
that
they're
not
adequate.
you're
saying
we've
got
to
have
a
bike
path
because
there's
too
much
traffic.
we've
got
to
improve
the...
or
set
aside
more
land
for
creek
overflow
because
there's
going
to
be
a
quicker
runoff.
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
made
kind
of
a
conclusive
determination
with
respect
to...
to
the
petitioner
here,
but
you
haven't
made
any
determination
on...
on
your
theory
with
respect
to
the
nonlittoral
owners.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
is...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
as
i
understand
it,
the
petitioner
here
would
not
have
been
allowed
by
the
city
to
come
in
and
say
there's...
there's
plenty
of
room
for
the
creek
to
flow
and
there's...
there's
plenty
of
capacity
in
the
streets
and
sidewalks.
you've
already
determined
that
the
answer
to...
in
each
case,
is
that
there
is
not
sufficient
capacity--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
does...
does
the
property
owner
two
blocks
away
have
to
ask
for
a
variance?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
proof,
so
called,
has
already
been
made.
and
the
way
for
the
littoral
property
owner,
the
petitioner
here,
to
alleviate
the
burden
is
to
ask
for
a
variance.
those...
those,
at
least,
are
procedurally
different
mechanisms,
aren't
they?
yes...
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
there's
no
proportionality
requirement,
but...
but
proportionality
is
a
subject
of
evidence
to
indicate
whether
in
fact
the
required
relationship...
i.e.,
serving
the
same
purpose...
is
present
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
burden,
i
assume,
would
be...
on
your
theory,
would
be
on
the
landowner
to
show
the
disproportionality?
