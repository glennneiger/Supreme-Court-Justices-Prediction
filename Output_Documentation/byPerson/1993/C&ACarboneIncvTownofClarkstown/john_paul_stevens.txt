justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask,
to
be
sure
i'm
clear
on
one
question...
do
i
correctly
understand,
you
do
not
challenge
the
scheme
insofar
as
it
gives
the
town
a
total
monopoly
of
the
processing
and
distribution
of
trash
generated
within
the
town?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
as
a
factual
matter,
what
you're
really
complaining
about
is
in
order
to
stay
in
business
you'd
have
to
move
outside
the
city
limits?
because
then
the
ordinance
wouldn't
hurt
you
at
all,
if
you
were
outside
the
city
limits,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
still
would
have
an
impact
on
you
because
you
couldn't
get
any
locally
generated
trash,
but
you
don't
object
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
at
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
thing
that's
as
issue
is
whether
you
can
be
compelled
to
move
outside
the
city
limits
to
continue
receiving
trash
from
other
locations.
that's
really
what...
i
suppose
that's
what...
and
if
you're
going
to
stay
in
business,
you
just
have
to
move
your
plant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
license
doesn't
do
you
any
good
if
you
can't
get
any
trash.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
get
the
trash
if
you...
if
you
were
located
outside
the...
outside
the
city.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
the
only
facility
that
they
operate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
true
that
in...
i
think
it's
the
house
committee
report
on
that
statute,
they
did
specifically
refer
to
this
sort
of
restriction.
i
know
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
doesn't,
but
one
of
the
briefs
quotes
a
portion
of
a
house
report
that
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
wasn't
that
just
dealing
with
locally
generated
waste?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
all
i
can
suggest
is
if
it
doesn't
tell
us
whether
there
was
any
nonlocally
generated
waste
involved,
the
case
really
doesn't
address
the
precise
issue
that
your
opponent
is
raising
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
isn't
the
point
that
it's
moving
out.
it's
coming
from
a
location
that's
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
community.
that's
the...
that's
the
thing,
the
most
troublesome
point
to
me,
is
the
fact...
let
me
give
you
a
little
hypothetical
i
keep
thinking
about.
supposing
there's
another
processing
plant
right
outside
of
town
that
will
pay
a
tipping
fee
of
75.
and
so
the...
they've
got
three
choices:
81
to
your
facility,
71
if
these
people
stay
in
business,
or
75
outside.
now,
if
your
ordinance
is
in
effect
and
you
drive
these
people
out
of
business,
the
business
will
shift
from
a
71
figure
to
a
75
figure,
and
doesn't
that
burden
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
make
the
outside
people
pay
more
than
they
otherwise
would
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
it
can't
be
justified
by
your
need
to
control
and
dispose...
have
a
total
monopoly
of
all
locally
generated
waste.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
help
me
with
one
factual
matter?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you
correctly.
is
it
correct
that
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
ordinance
if
the
petitioner
separated
out
the
recyclable
garbage
and
shipped
that
out
of
state
and
made
money
out
of
that,
so
long
as
it
took
the
nonrecyclable
and
shipped
it
over
to
your
facility
and
paid
81
a
ton
for
that
portion
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
say
there's
some
practical
reason
why
they
can't
do
it,
some
24-hour
limit
and
so
forth.
is
it
practically
feasible
for
them
to
do
it
and
just
pay
a
little
more
for
that
portion
of
the
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
representing
the
town,
that
would
be
perfectly
lawful
if
they
were
willing
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
do
you
draw
the
conclusion
for
that...
for
that
reason,
after
the
garbage
is
separated
you
are
entitled
to
look
at
the
nonrecyclable
residue
as
locally
generated
because
it
was
generated
within
the
town?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
correct
that
there...
that
the
processing
itself
violates
the
ordinance?
i
thought
it
was
what
you
do
with
the
residue
after
the
processing
that
preempts
the...
creates
the
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
violate
the
ordinance
just
by
processing
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
long
as
you
ship
the
residue
over
to
their
facility
and
pay
them
81
a
ton
as
a
tipping
fee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
not
objecting
to...
you're
not
objecting
to
any
restriction
on
process.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
the
disposal
of
the...
of
the
residue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
am
i
correct
that
the
81
a
ton
doesn't
have
any
impact
at
all
on
the
portion
of
your
business
that
deals
with
recyclable
garbage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
can
continue
to
do
that
as
long
as
you
pay
the
81
on
the
residue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
why
isn't
the
residue
locally
generated
waste
if
it
produced
by
the
recycling
that
takes
place
within
the
community?
