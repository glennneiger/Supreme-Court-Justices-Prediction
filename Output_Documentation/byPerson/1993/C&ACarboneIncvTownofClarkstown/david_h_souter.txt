justice
david
h.
souter
because
there
was
a
discrimination
in
those
cases
too,
wasn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
really...
you're
basically
just
making...
i
shouldn't
say
just.
you're
basically
making
a
burden
argument,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
said
a
second
ago
as
a
factual
matter
something
that
i
just
didn't
understand.
you
said
that
the...
the...
well,
i
may
have
you
wrong.
you
said
that
those
who
export
trash
out
of
state
must
subject
the
trash
to
a
further
processing;
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
understand
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
what
does
that
consist
of?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
the
fact
that
your
clients
do
bale
their
residue
is
not
a
requirement
of
the
town
ordinance.
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
it,
after
they
separate
the
recyclables
that
they
take
out
from
what
is
then
going
to
be
ultimately
baled
and
exported,
they
could
just
bring
that
in
bulk
to
the
town
transfer
station,
and
it
would
be
processed
and
baled
there,
wouldn't
it,
couldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
simply
a
function
of
the
way
your
clients
have
set
up
their
plant?
couldn't
they
set
it
up
in
such
a
way
that
they
take
out
the
recyclables
and
what
is
left
gets
dumped
into
a
truck
and
the
truck
goes
to
the
town
transfer
station
where
it's
baled?
couldn't...
couldn't
that
happen?
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-huh.
in
any
case,
i
take
it
your
case
does
not
depend
on...
really
on
the
answer
to
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we'll
agree
with
you
that
you
had
to
close
down
the
landfill
for
environmental
purposes,
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
you
have
an
environmental
purpose
for
this
restriction
if
you
can
accomplish
the
same
purpose
by
health
and
safety
regulations,
and
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
could.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
a
commerce
clause
issue
unless
you've
got
a
justification
for
your
burden,
and
this
is
your
only
justification.
you're
in
exactly
the
same
boat
if
you've
got
to
justify
your
burden,
even
though
it's
a
nondiscriminatory
burden.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
sure
we
are.
every
burden
that
passes
due
process
muster
because
there
is
some
rational
basis
is
not
necessarily
going
to
pass
a
rational
basis
test
for
discrimination,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
thought...
but
i
thought...
i
thought
you
were
assuming
just
the
opposite
in
what
you
said
a
moment
ago.
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-hum.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
one
of
the...
i
think
one
of
our
problems
is
we're
still
not
sure
what
those
police
power
reasons
are.
and
i
think
you
deflected
the
question
by
saying
well
that's
really
a
fourteenth
amendment
question,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
assume...
we
all
accept
that
the
city
gets
an
economic
benefit.
what
are
the
other
police
power
reasons
that
could
not
have
been
realized
by
health
and
safety
regs.
