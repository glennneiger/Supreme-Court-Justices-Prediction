ms.
betty
jo
christian
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
commerce
clause
prohibits
a
municipal
ordinance
that
requires
all
trash,
including
trash
that
originated
in
other
towns
and
other
states,
to
be
sent
to
a
designated
local
facility
for
processing
before
it
can
be
shipped
to
other
states
for
disposal.
petitioners
operate
a
recycling
facility
in
clarkstown,
new
york.
they
receive
trash
from
new
jersey
and
from
points
in
new
york
outside
of
clarkstown,
separate
it
into
recyclable
and
nonrecyclable
components,
process
and
bale
or
package
both
components,
and
then
ship
them
to
users
or
disposers
in
other
states.
the
clarkstown
ordinance
permits
them
to
ship
the
recyclables
directly
to
users
in
other
states.
however,
it
prohibits
petitioners
from
shipping
the
nonrecyclable
trash
directly
to
waste
energy
plants
or
landfills
in
other
states,
and
requires
instead
that
they
be
sent
to
a
designated
transfer
station
in
clarkstown,
which
levies--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--we
are
primarily
attacking
section
5.
the
respondents
have
taken
the
position
that
this
case
is
governed
instead
by
section
3.
to
the
extent
that
section
3
has
any
bearing
on
trash
that
originated
outside
of
clarkstown,
we
are
attacking
that
section
as
well.
but
our
challenge
is
limited
to
the
trash
that
originated
in
towns
outside
of
clarkstown.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
the
designated--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
think,
from
the
standpoint
of
constitutional
analysis,
justice
scalia,
it
is
also
invalid
under
this
court's
prior
decisions.
but
as
a
business
matter
in
the
lower
courts--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--the...
precisely.
[laughter]
the
petitioners
chose
to
challenge
only
the
out-of-town
trash,
because
that's
what
their
business
really
consists
of.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
yes--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--the
city
prohibits
petitioners
from
shipping
the
trash
directly
to
out-of-state
users
or
landfills.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
as...
as
we
understand
the
ordinance
as
it
has
been
interpreted
by
the
city,
the
petitioners
are
required,
after
they
have
processed
and
baled
the
trash,
to
deliver
it
to
the
designated
transfer
facility.
that
transfer
facility
levies
the
charge
of
81
a
ton,
and
then
the
transfer
facility
itself
ships
the
trash
to
landfills
in
other
states.
so
that
petitioners
themselves
are
required...
instead
of
taking
the
trash
directly
to
an
out-of-state
destination,
petitioners
are
required
to
take
it
to
the
designated
facility.
the
designated
facility
then
performs
whatever
processing
they
perform,
and
the--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--it
is
less
expensive
for
the
out-of-state
customers
of
petitioners,
and
with
respect
to
petitioners
the
clarkstown
ordinance,
in
effect,
adds
an
expense
of
81
for
every
ton
of
nonrecyclable
trash.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
well,
petitioners--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--it
apparently
does
not
apply
to
that,
but,
in
fact,
petitioners
do
not
do
that.
petitioners
are
in
the
business
of
operating
a
recycling
facility.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
in
the
town.
now,
the
trash
itself
is
brought
to
petitioners
by
haulers
from
other
towns
or
other
states.
petitioners
themselves
are
not
picking
up
trash
in
the
other
towns
or
states.
it
is
brought
to
them
by
private
trucking
companies,
which
bring
the
trash
to
petitioners.
petitioners
then
process
and
bale
the
trash,
and
then
load
it
onto
the
trucks
of
independent
trucking
companies.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
but
the...
that
is
correct,
but
the
constitutional
flaw
is
the
export
ban
itself,
the
local
processing
requirement.
the
lower
courts
reasoned
that
there
was
no
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
because
it
applied
the
local
processing
requirement
to
local
as
well
as
out-of-town
trash.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
certainly,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
well,
a
municipality
certainly,
if
it
wished
to
take
on
the
job
of
trash
collection
itself,
could
take
the
trash
wherever
it
wants
to
take
it.
and
the
municipality
certainly
can
impose
reasonable
health
and
safety
and
environmental
requirements
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
trash.
they
also
have
substantial
power
under
the
zoning
laws
to
determine
whether
and
to
what
extent
trash
facilities
will
be
permitted
in
the
town.
now,
in
this
particular
case
the
town
had
initially
denied
petitioners'
request
for
a
permit
to
operate
the
recycling
facility.
that
was
appealed
within
the
new
york
state
courts.
the
courts
ruled
that
the
town
had
acted
improperly
in
denying
the
permit,
and
directed
the
town
to
issue
the
permit,
and
the
permit
has
now
been
issued.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
we
have
to
draw
a
distinction
between
a
city
that
merely
operates
the
transfer
station
itself
as
a
municipal
facility,
and
a
city
that
also
collects
the
trash.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
if
the
city
itself
collects
the
trash,
then
it
can
take
the
trash
wherever
it
wants.
we
don't
think
that
the
city
could
prohibit
petitioner,
who
holds
a
license
to
operate
a
recycling
facility,
from
transporting
trash
outside
the
state.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
the
issue
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
whether
or
not
that
is
an
appropriate
subject
for
public
utility
regulation
as
a
monopoly,
and
that
would
bring
into
play
a
totally
different
set
of
requirements.
but
that--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--that
would
primarily
be
a
question
of
state
law.
it
conceivably,
i
would
think,
might
involve
some
constitutional
issues
with
respect
to
its
effect
on
a
facility
such
as
petitioners',
that
previously
held
a
license,
but
those
would
be
entirely
different
issues
and
that's
not
this
case.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
that
you
would
for
this
reason,
because
it
would
still
prohibit
the
export
of
trash
out
of
the
state
to
any
other
point
in
interstate
commerce,
to
any
point
other
than
the
designated
transfer
facility.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
i
would
call
that
protectionism,
because
it...
at
least
if,
as
in
this
case,
the
result
is
to
confer
a
direct
benefit
on
the
town
and
its
residents.
in
this
case
there
is
clearly
a
direct
benefit
to
the
town.
at
the
time
that
the
designated
facility
was
constructed,
the
town
entered
into
a
take-or-pay
agreement
under
which
it
guarantees
the
transfer
facility
a
certain
volume
of
trash.
and
if
that
guarantee
is
not
met,
then
it
has
to
pay
for
the
lost
revenues.
so
that
every
ton
of
out-of-town
trash
that
petitioners
can
be
forced
to
send
to
the
designated
facility,
instead
of
directly
out
of
state,
results
in
a
reduction
of
the
town's
liability
under
the
guarantee
of
81
a
ton,
and
a
direct
benefit
to
the
town's
residents,
a
direct
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
and
i
would
think
it
would
make
no
difference
if
the
facility
happened
to
be
located
across
the
line
in
another
state,
as
long
as
that--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--that
would
be
our
point
exactly.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
believe
that
this
court
has
struck
down
reciprocity
requirements
in
the
past
that
were
limited
in
such
a
way
that
they
are,
in
effect,
prohibiting
the
export
to
any
states
other
than
the
favored
state.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
don't
think
that's
quite
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
let
me
see
if
i
can
clarify
it.
under
the
market
participant
doctrine,
the
town
would
be
entitled
to
enter
into
the
trash
collection
business
as
a
participant
in
the
market.
and
if
it
did
that,
it
would
be
permitted,
like
any
private
business,
to
choose
who
it
wanted
to
deal
with.
so
in
that
circumstance,
it
could
choose
to
take
all
of
the
trash
that
it
collected
to
a
private
facility.
now
if,
in
addition
to
collecting
trash
itself,
it
also
permitted
the
operation
of
petitioners'
recycling
facility,
which
is
licensed
by
both
the
town
and
the
state
to
conduct
a
recycling
operation,
then
we
do
not
believe
that
the
town
could
compel
petitioners
to
make
use
of
the
designated
transfer
facility.
i
was
only
suggesting
that
if
the
town
wished
to
take
on
the
function
of
collecting
trash
itself,
then
under
the
market
participant
doctrine
it
could
take
the
trash
that
it
collected
wherever
it
wants
to
take
it.
it
can
deal
with
whoever
it
wants
to
deal
with.
we
believe
that
this
case
is
essentially
governed
by
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
city
of
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
and
in
fort
gratiot
landfill
v.
michigan.
those
cases,
of
course,
struck
down
laws
barring
the
import
of
trash
into
a
state.
there
are
basically
only
two
fundamental
differences
between
those
cases
and
this
case.
the
first,
of
course,
is
that
this
involves
a
restriction
on
the
export
of
trash;
those
cases
involved
restrictions
on
import.
but
the
court
explicitly
pointed
out
in
city
of
philadelphia
that
the
commerce
clause
prohibits
the
movement
of
the...
restrictions
on
the
movement
of
goods
into
or
out
of
a
state.
and
second--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--there
was
a
different
treatment
in
those
cases
of
local
and
out-of-town
trash.
but
in
this
case,
and
in
the...
as...
this
case
is
like
the
local
processing
cases
or
the
export
ban
decisions
previously
decided
by
this
court,
in
which
you
have
a...
an
overt
restriction
on
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce
itself.
and
as
to
cases
in
which
you
have
an
overt--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
think
this
is
more
of
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
yes,
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
and
the
burden
on
commerce
is
created,
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
local
processing
decisions,
by
the
requirement
that
it
undergo
local
processing
at
the
designated
transfer
facility
before
it
can
go
out
of
state.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
it
may
be
hard
to
draw
the
line
between--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--discrimination
against
and
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
certainly
it
is
a
burden
on
and--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
think
it's
probably
a
discrimination
against
petitioners'
out-of-state
customers
who
are
required
to
undergo
additional
processing
after
their
trash
has
already
been
processed
and
baled,
at
the
designated
facility.
but
the
principal
focus
of
the
attack
has
been
on
the
burden
that
this
statute
creates
on
the
free
flow
of
interstate
commerce.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
it
is
a
discrimination
against
exporters.
i
think
the...
the
only
sense
in
which
you
could
say
it
is
not
a
discrimination
is
that
it
discriminates
against
the
export
of
trash
by
both
local
and
out-of-town
trash.
but
we
would
suggest
that
it
discriminates
against
the
exporters
of
trash
and
also
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
under
either
test,
we
believe
it's
invalid.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
we
think
it
falls
within
the
category
of
laws
that
overtly
block
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce
and
therefore
are
virtually
per
se
invalid.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that's
correct,
justice
souter,
as
applied--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--petitioners
themselves
process
and
bale
the
trash
that
is
brought
to
them
from
outside
the
town.
and
when
it's
loaded
onto
trucks
to
leave
petitioners'
facility,
it
is
then
ready
for
transportation
to
landfills
or
to
waste
energy
plants.
nothing
further
is
needed,
and
yet
under
this
statute
it
is
required
to
go
to
the
designated
transfer
facility
for
additional
processing
at
the
transfer
facility.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
two
points.
first
of
all,
as
a
practical
matter
you're
talking
about
150
tons
of
trash
a
week.
the
way
that
the
processing
is
handled,
when
it
comes
off
the
conveyor
belts
after
the
recyclables
have
been
separated
out,
it
goes
into
the
processing
machines
where
the
processing
and
the
baling
occurs.
so
as
a
practical
matter--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
permit
under
which
they
operate
by
new
york
state,
or
by
the
town
itself.
under
the
permit,
for
example,
the
handling
of
trash
is
strictly
regulated.
one
requirement,
for
example,
is
that
all
nonrecyclable
trash
that
goes
through
petitioners'
facility
must
be
moved
out
within
24
hours.
so
you
can't
have
trash
piling
up
waiting
to
be
picked
up.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
no,
it
does
not,
because
even
if
under...
under
this
court's
local
processing
decisions,
even
if
there
were
no
local...
duplicate
processing
involved,
it
would
still
be
an
overt
restriction
on
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce.
and
under
that--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--yes.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
the
tipping
fee
charge
by
petitioners
is
70
a
ton.
that
charged
by
the
transfer...
designated
facility
is
81
a
ton.
and
this,
of
course,
to
petitioners
amounts
to
an
added
expense
that
they
are
required
to
bear
with
respect
to
the
portion
of
their
trash
that
constitutes
nonrecyclables.
that's
an
expense
that
would
have
to
be
added
on
and
one
which
they
could
not
bear.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
the
injunction
in
this
case
went
into
effect,
petitioners
were
forced
to
temporarily
shut
down
their
operations.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
there
is
no
explanation
other
than
the
fact
that
the
town
approved
the
fee
of
81
a
ton.
the
town
was
required
to
approve
the
fee
being
charged
by
the
designated
facility.
the
petitioners
set
their
own
fee.
that
is
the
only
explanation.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
in
the
lower
courts,
petitioners
limited
their
commerce
clause
challenge
to
trash
that
originated
outside
the
town,
that
is
correct.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
if
we
were
not
in
clarkstown,
then
the
ordinance
would
not
apply,
because
it
only
applies
within
the
confines
of
clarkstown.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
we
did
not
raise
a
commerce
clause
challenge.
quite
candidly,
we
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
analysis,
the
ordinance
also
violates
the
commerce
clause
with
respect
to
locally
generated
trash.
but--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
that's
correct.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
we
are
licensed
by
the
town
to
operate
the
recycling
facility
in
clarkstown,
that's
correct.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
under
this--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--we
could...
we
could
get
the
trash
if
we
were
willing
to
move
our
facility,
but
we
submit
that
that
is
not
an
excuse
to
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
would
be
a
major
burden
on
petitioners,
since
you
cannot
simply
move
a
trash
facility
to--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
believe
this
is
the
only
facility
that
the
carbone
company
itself
operates.
there
are
some
related
companies
located
in
other
states,
but
c
&
a
carbone,
inc.,
i
believe
operates
only
the
one
facility.
our
basic
point
is
that
this
is
an
overt
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
that
could
be
justified
only
if
the
town
could
show
that
it
is
justified
by
a
valid
factor
unrelated
to
economic
protectionism,
and
that
that
factor
can't
adequate
serve...
be
served
by
nondiscriminatory
means.
we
believe
that
the
out-of-town
origin
of
the
trash
essentially
eliminates
most
of
the
justifications
that
the
town
has
sought
to
offer.
as
far
as
health
and
safety
or
environmental
justifications
are
concerned,
petitioners
are
subject
to
exactly
the
same
requirements
as
the
designated
facility,
and
the
town
can
certainly
add
more
stringent
requirements
if
it
thinks
that's
necessary.
there
is
no
danger
that
this
facility
will
be
shut
down
in
the
absence
of
the
flow
control
ordinance.
the
only
danger
is
that
the
town
might
have
to
make
good
under
its
guarantee,
and
that
is,
by
definition,
economic
protectionism.

christian
we
think
that's
clearly
not
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
only
reliance...
the
only
citations
that
have
been
made
have
been
to
provisions
of
the
rcra
statute,
which
refer
not
to
flow
control
laws,
but
to
long-term
contracts.
that
they're
not
the
same
thing.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
suggested
that
one
of
the
nondiscriminatory
alternatives
that
might
be
pursued
is
long-term
contracts.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
has
pending
before
it
right
now
several
bills
that
would
authorize
flow
control
laws
in
specific
limited
circumstances.
the
only
action
taken
thus
far
has
been
to
ask
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
supply
congress
with
its
views
by
september
of
1994.
but
clearly
nothing
that
congress
has
done
to
date
satisfies
the
very
stringent
test
for
a
clear
expression
of
the
intent
of
congress
to
authorize
action
that
would
otherwise
violate
the
commerce
clause.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
they're
referring
to
these
statutes.
there
was
testimony
that
referred
to
these,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
itself--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--that
refers
to
flow
control
laws.
and
congress...
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
in
order
for
congress...
in
order
for
a
statute
to
be
interpreted
as
authorizing
action
that
would
otherwise
violate
the
commerce
clause,
there
must
be
a
clear
expression
of
intent,
and
this
falls
far
short
of
that.
we
don't
think
that
you
need
to
reach
the
issue
of
nondiscriminatory
alternatives
at
all,
because
there
is
nothing
here
other
than
economic
protectionism.
but
simply
to
complete
our
point,
it
is
apparent
that
even
if
there
were
some
valid
nonprotectionist
purpose,
those
purposes
could
be
met
adequately
by
means
that
do
not
impose
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
to
begin
with,
there
is
the
simple
expediency
of
the
transfer
station,
the
designated
facility,
competing
in
the
marketplace
for
trash.
and
in
this
connection,
i
think
it's
important
to
observe
that,
in
the
absence
of
flow
control
laws,
there's
no
apparent
reason
why
the
designated
facility
would
not
be
able
to
compete
successfully
for
trash
in
neighboring
towns
and
states.
the
amicus
brief
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
for
example,
reveals
that
the
tipping
fees
in
new
jersey
are
substantially
higher
than
the
81
charged
by
the
designated
facility.
the
reason
that
they
are
not
permit...
able
to
compete
for
those
now
is
that
under
new
jersey
law,
which
also
has
a
flow
control
law,
trash
is
permitted
to
leave
new
jersey
for
purposes
of
recycling,
of
separating
into
recyclable
and
nonrecyclable
components,
but
only
on
condition
that
the
nonrecyclables
are
brought
back
to
new
jersey.
now,
petitioners,
of
course,
are
placed
in
the
position,
by
this
statute,
of
being
literally
unable
to
comply
with
the
flow
control
laws
of
both
new
jersey
and
clarkstown,
because
clarkstown
directs
that
this
identical
trash
must
go
to
the
designated
transfer
facility.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
that
might
be
the
next
case.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
may
be
the
next
case,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
that
this
simply
reflects
the
changed
economics
of
trash
disposal,
justice
scalia.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents,
in
response
to
a
question,
have,
i
believe,
admitted
that
this
law
would
be
invalid
if
it
required
that
trash
must
be
processed
within
5
miles
of
the
city
limits
of
clarkstown.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
there
is
no
difference,
from
a
constitutional
standpoint,
from
a
commerce
clause
standpoint,
between
such
a
requirement
and
the
requirement
that
we
have
in
this
case,
which
requires
that
it
must
be
processed
at
the
designated
transfer
station.
now,
beyond
this--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--it
is
within
clarkstown.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
believe
there
was
a
question
to
respondents
if
it
would
be
valid
if
it...
if
the
law
required
processing
within
5
miles
of
clarkstown.
i
think
this
falls
within
that
description.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
it
is
not
what...
it
is
not
the
processing
done
by--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--no.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that's
right,
and
pay
them
81
a
ton,
but
for
the
processing.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
no.
we're
objecting
to
the
restriction
that
requires
what
they
require...
regard
as
local
processing
at
the
designated
transfer
facility,
for
which
they
charge
the
81
a
ton.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
it
is--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--we
don't
know
what
they
would
do
when
they
receive
it.
it
is
the
processing
and
the
disposal
of
the
residue.
now,
respondents
have
taken
the
position--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--the
ordinance
itself
permits
the
recyclables
to
be
shipped
directly
outside
of...
out
of
state.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
is
correct.
as
long
as
we
ship--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--for
one
specific
reason.
we
do
not
discard
the
revenue...
the
residue.
petitioners'
business
consists
of
the
handling
of
trash.
after
they
separate
out
the
recyclables
petitioners
themselves
process
and
bale
the
trash,
and
themselves
ship
it
to
landfills
or
waste
energy
plants
which
they
pay
to
accept
disposal
of
the
nonrecyclables.
so
the
fundamental
difference
is
that
petitioners
never
discard
anything.
they're
in
the
business
of
handling
the
trash.
now,
we
believe
that
this
statute,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
jurisprudence,
would
be
unconstitutional
even
with
respect
to
locally
discarded
trash.
but
the
fact
is
petitioners
never
discard
trash
at
all.
they
handle
it,
they
dispose
of
it
out
of
state.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
no,
that
is
not
our
position.
the
trash
plainly
has
been
interpreted
to
apply
to
the
nonrecyclable
residue
of
petitioners'
operation,
which
they
do
not
discard
in
the
city.
respondents--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--not
quite,
justice
o'connor.
we
do
not
discard
trash,
but
the
ordinance
nevertheless
has
been
interpreted
by
the
new
york
state
courts
as
applying
to
our
operation.
a
major
distinction
between
trash
handled
by
petitioners
and
the
local
trash
to
which
respondents
sought
to
draw
an
analogy
is
that
we
do
not
discard
it.
a
correction
of
one
factual
point.
respondents
also
said
that
under
the
permit
petitioners
are
limited
to
handling
trash
that
is
no
more
than
10
percent
nonrecyclable.
there
is
no
such
limit.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
thank
you.
