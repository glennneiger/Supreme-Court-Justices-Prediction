justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
why
don't
you
have
any
objection
to
trash
that's
generated
within
clark...
you
don't
have
any
objection
to
trash
generated
within
clarkstown?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
christian,
i
don't
gather
that
the
commerce
clause
permits
a
state
to
favor
commerce
with
one
state
over
commerce
with
other
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
a
matter
of
favoring
your
own.
you
also
can't
say
new
york
favors
new
jersey,
and
we
don't
favor
shipping
to
other
states,
you
can't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't--
--and
you
don't
think
this
is
a
discrimination
case,
then,
huh?
is
that
what
you're
saying,
you
don't?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry
to
hear
that,
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
know...
you've
said
it's
a
burden.
do
you
think
it's
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
you
challenge
the
new
jersey
flow
control
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
next.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
must
say,
the
spectacle
of
all
states
and
municipalities
wrestling
for
control
over
garbage
is
really
quite
wonderful.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brashares.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
if
one
has
a
generous
and
nongreedy
motive,
it's
okay
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce?
i
mean,
if
i
am
not
getting
anything
personally
out
of...
out
of
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce,
it
is
not
protectionism
and
therefore
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
has
to
be
reasonable.
it
hasn't
to
be...
the
point
is
not
that
it's
not
protectionist,
but
that
it
is
reasonable,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
our
commerce
clause
law
says
that
the
only
invalid
restrictions
upon
interstate
commerce
are
those
that
are
imposed
for
protectionist
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
all
of
these
are
legislative
judgments.
i
mean
what
you're
saying
is
not
for
health
reasons.
there's
no
health
reason
why
it
has
to
be
taken
to
this
particular
plant,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
somebody
says
i
want
to
take
it
to
another
plant;
it's
cheaper,
it's
out
of
state.
and
you
say,
no,
you
can't
do
that,
you
must
take
it
to
this
plant.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
not
a
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
dean
milk
establishes
that
that
makes
no
difference.
just
because
you
discriminate
against
other
intrastate
facilities
does
not
enable
you
to
discriminate
against
out-of-state
facilities
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
you
say
because
carbone
is
in
clarksburg
itself,
this
restriction
can
be
imposed
on
carbone.
does
that
mean
you
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
prohibit
your
local
citizens.
since
they're
part
of
the
voting
group,
you
can
prohibit
them
from
dealing
in
interstate
commerce
because...
i
don't
understand
what
you're
arguing.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
that's
what
you're
saying,
that
you
can
prevent
local
people
from
dealing
in
interstate
commerce.
i
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--every
local
person
has
to
buy
at
the
clarksburg
shopping
mall.
all
local
people
have
to
take
their
trade
there.
they
can't...
they
can't
go
elsewhere.
does
that
violate
the
commerce
clause?
it
certainly
does,
and
i
fail
to
see
why
it
makes
much
of
a
difference
if
you
say
all
local
people
have
to
get
their
trash
processed
at
this
particular
processing
plant.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
this
case
any
different
from
dean
milk.
it's
just
dean
milk
in
reverse,
it
seems
to
me.
suppose
that
the
town
in
dean
milk
had
said
that
all
milk
sold
in
the
city,
for
health
reasons
has
to
be
pasteurized,
just
as
you're
saying
for
health
reasons
this
trash
has
to
be
disposed
of,
and
it
will
all
be
pasteurized
in
a
city-owned
or
city-contracted-for
plant
just
outside
the
city?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
allowed
anymore
than--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
pasteurize
milk.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is.
pasteurization
certainly
has
a
legitimate
public
purpose,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
city
says
we
can
be
sure
that
the
pasteurization
is
being
done
properly
if
it's
being
done
in
this
plant
which
we
will
supervise.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
that
that's
the
only
problem
there,
was
with
dean
milk,
that
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--city
didn't
require
it
to
be
pasteurized
in
its
own
plant.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brashares--
--no,
they...
they
used
the
same
kind
of
legitimate
basis
that
you're
trying
to
use.
they
said
health
interests,
and
we
said,
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
ways
to
preserve
those
health
interests
without
requiring
that
the
milk
be
pasteurized
within
5
miles
of
the
city.
and
we
said
you
have
to,
rather
than
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
this
way,
use
those
other
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
that
transfer
station
is
within
5
miles
of
clarkstown?
