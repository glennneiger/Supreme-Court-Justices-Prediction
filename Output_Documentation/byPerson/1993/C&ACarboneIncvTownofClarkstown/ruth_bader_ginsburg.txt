ms.
christian,
did
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
was
essentially
that
the
town
isn't
doing
enough
to
escape
from
this
commerce
clause
check?
that
is
if
they
handled
the
entire
trash
business
you
would
have
no
complaint,
but
it's
only
because
they
don't
haul
the
trash
themselves
that
you
can
make
this
argument.

have
it
right?

made
a
point

before
you...
your
red
light
goes
on,
i
wanted
to
be
clear
that,
in
bringing
up
what
justice
o'connor
asked
your
opponent,
you
are
not
relying,
as
some
of
your
amici
have
been,
on
congressional
permission?
