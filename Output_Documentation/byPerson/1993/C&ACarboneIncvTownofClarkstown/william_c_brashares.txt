mr.
william
c.
brashares
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
central
concept
of
economic
protectionism
means
the
allocation
of
economic
benefits
among
private
parties
engaged
in
commerce
on
the
basis
of
political
geography.
i
think
the
essence
of
economic
protectionism
is
discrimination.
it
means
that
those
who
are
protected,
those
who
vote
within
the
political
process,
receive
benefits,
and
those
who
are
outside
the
political
process,
who
do
not
vote,
do
not
receive
benefits.
i
would
like
to...
i
make
that
statement
because
i
think
that
concept
reconciles,
certainly,
the
philadelphia
chemical
waste,
fort
gratiot,
it
reconciles
the
processing
cases,
it
reconciles
the
so-called
hoarding
cases.
it
has
to
do
with
the
discrimination
between
the
haves,
the
represented,
and
the
have-nots.
and
that
principle
applied
in
this
case
answers
two
questions.
first
of
all,
since
there
is
no
discrimination,
we
are
outside
of
the
universe
of
economic
protectionism.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
yes.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
what
the
maine
against
taylor
case
is
probably
all
about.
i
think
there
is
certainly
a
very
strong
presumption
that
when
a
state
or
local
law
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
geography,
that
there
is
a
protectionist
purpose.
i
think
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
that
is
rebuttable
if
you
can
show
that
there
is
not...
there
is,
in
fact,
a
rational
basis
for
the
discrimination.
and
i
think
in
maine
against
taylor,
what
the
court,
in
effect,
did
was
to
say,
yes,
there
is
a
rational
basis
here.
but
i
think
the
absence
of
benefit
does
not
necessarily
make
the
discrimination
condoned.
there--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--well--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--well,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
i
am
putting
together,
and
i
think
appropriately
so,
protectionism
and
discrimination
on
a
geographic
basis.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
is
almost
impossible,
unthinkable
to
find
a
state
or
local
law
which
allocates
or
regulates,
on
the
basis
of
geography,
those
who
are
within
the
political
process
being
treated
one
way
and
those
outside
another
way,
without
there
being
some
element
of
protectionism.
i
would
grant
that
there
could
be
cases
where
discrimination
did
not
have
those
benefits,
but
i
think...
or
allocation.
but
i
think
here,
if
i
can
get
to
this
case,
first
of
all,
we
do
not
have
a
law
which
has
a
discrimination.
we
do
not
have
a
law
which
classifies
on
the
basis
of
geography,
on
the
basis
of
whether
you're
in
or
outside
of
the
political
process.
the
law
here,
which
counsel
has
referred
to
as
an
export
ban...
well,
i
suppose
every
law
which
regulates
locally
and
has
the
effect
of
preventing
a
product
from
going
out
of
the
jurisdiction,
in
the
same
sense
is
an
export
ban.
and
in
that
same
sense,
export
bans
have
never
been
held,
as
such,
to
be
unconstitutional,
and
that's
why
this
case
is
not
the
flip
side,
as
counsel
has
put
it,
of
the
new
jersey
case.
the
key
there
is
discrimination.
is
a
product
kept
out
because
it
is
from
outside?
is
it
kept
in
because
it's
from
inside,
and
is
it
kept
in,
in
the
case
of
the
processing
and
hoarding
and
other
cases,
for
the
benefit
of
local
interests.
and
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
question...
if
i
can
answer
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
the
counsel,
about
is
this
city,
is
this
town
essentially
capturing...
that
word
has
been
used
in
the
papers
of
the
petitioners.
is
this
town
attempting
to
capture
waste
that
is
moving
in
interstate
commerce?
well,
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
capturing
conveys
the
idea
that
there
is
truck
moving
through
town
and
the
town
is
reaching
out
for
its
greedy
purposes,
capturing
the
truck
and
making
them
pay
a
fee
to
pass
through.
that
is
not
at
all
what's
going
on.
i
need
to
remind...
i
need
to
state
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
a
permit
to
operate
under
new
york
law
as
a
recycling
center.
they
have
a
permit
which
states
that
90
percent
of
the
material
they
bring
to
their
facility
will
be
recyclable.
in
fact,
in
their
permit
application
they
say
they
are
going
to
recycle
cardboard.
that
means
there
would
be
10
percent
of
that
total
material
which
would
be
discarded,
worthless
garbage,
as
we
put
it.
now,
they
bring
that
material
into
their
facility
in
clarkstown.
as
the...
mr.
carbone
specifically
testified,
they
put
it
on
their
floor,
they
separate
it
out
into
the
recyclables
which,
as
we
know,
they
are
permitted
to
sell
and
to
ship
in
interstate
commerce,
and
into
the
residue.
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is
that
residue.
mr.
carbone
also
acknowledged,
in
an
affidavit
in
lower
court,
that
that
material
and
the
local
material
is
all
fungible.
and
he
said,
in
fact...
when
he
was
concerned
that
the
local
town
might
have
been
mixing
the
out-of-town
waste
with
the
local
waste,
he
said
once
it's
commingled
you
can't
tell
which
is
which.
now,
what
the
town
is
saying
to
mr.
carbone...
and
to
everyone
else
in
the
town,
no
matter
what
kind
of
business
they
operate,
the
town
is
saying
if
you
have
garbage
that
is
generated,
meaning
discarded,
in
our
town,
this
is
the
way
it
needs
to
be
handled.
we
believe
it's
in
the
interests
of
this
community...
we've
made
the
legislative
judgment
that
this
is
the
way
it
should
be
handled,
just
as
the
city
of
san
francisco
and
the
city
of
detroit
did
in
1905.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
no,
there
certain
is,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
justice--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--well,
justice
scalia,
first
of
all,
there
is
no
classification
which
in
any
way
separates
interstate
commerce
from
local
commerce.
as
i
said,
the
material
which
is
regulated--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--yes,
but,
judge,
there's
no...
there's
no
city
line
or
county
line
discrimination
involved
here.
there
is
no
reference
to
needing
to
deal
locally
with
local
facilities,
except
the
city.
and
there
is
the
classification
in
this
case
which
brings
into
discussion
the
question
of
monopolization.
in,
as
i
was
going
to
say,
the
state
of
california...
in
the
case
of
california
reduction,
which
this
court
decided
in
1905
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
lockner
era,
and
the
gardner
case,
considered
exactly
this
situation.
the
court
considered
whether
there
was
a...
not
a
rational
basis,
they
went
into
a
much
more
searching
inquiry
and
determined
that
the
town...
the
city
had
a
legitimate,
indeed
a
pressing
interest
in
regulating
in
the
area
of
waste
disposal.
that
the
method
they
had
chosen
was
appropriate
in
that
they
had
set
up
a
designated
facility,
they
had
franchised
it.
indeed,
in
san
francisco,
it
was
for
50
years.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
justice
stevens,
the
record
in
that
case
does
not
show
that
any
waste
was
coming
in
from
anywhere
or
was
going
out
to
anywhere.
interestingly,
the
district
court
in
the...
in
that
case
did
note
that
these
were
articles
of
commerce
because
they
were
claimed
to
be
of
value.
this
was
material
which
was
going
out
to
feed
livestock.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
it
does
address
it
in
this
sense.
if
we
don't
have
economic
protectionism,
if
we
don't
have
a
discrimination,
which
i
think
i
would
submit
we
do
not
have
here,
but
still...
but
still
the
petitioners
claim
that
the
use
of
this
power
by
the
city
is
wrong
under
the
constitution,
i
think
that
analysis
is
really
not
a
commerce
clause
analysis.
and
let
me
make
this
point
in
connection
with
california
reduction.
if
you
took
california
reduction
on
its
fourteenth
amendment
grounds
and
just
as
the
court
was
about
to
decide
that
case
the
petitioners
or
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
came
in
and
said
we
wish
to
amend,
we
have
just
discovered
that
garbage
is
moving
across
into
nevada
to
a
farm.
and
i
make
that
hypothetical
only
to
suggest
how
would
that
change
the
analysis?
the
fact
that
waste
is
moving
out
of
the
state
of
california
would
not
change
the
fourteenth
amendment
analysis.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--well,
your
honor,
no,
i
don't
think
it...
i
don't...
well,
whether
it's
a
burden...
certainly,
everything
that
raises
the
costs
of
parties
operating
in
commerce
is
arguably
a
burden.
whether
it
is
a
burden
that
this
court
would
take
into
account
and
balance
it,
in
the
pike
jargon.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
no,
absolutely,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
can
be
justified
by
the...
the
town's
need.
now,
your
honor,
i
have...
i
have
failed
to...
for
lack
of
time
and
priorities
here,
to
get
into
the
point
of
why
this
overall
legal
framework
of
the
city's
has
an
environmental
purpose.
now,
we
have,
of
course,
spelled
it
out
at
great
length
in
our
brief.
you
have
15
amicus
briefs
here
which
get
into
it
in
great
detail.
but
the
point
is
that,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
this
facility
resulted
from
the
fact
that
this
town
operated
a
landfill
for
many
years,
it
was
forced
to
close
it
down,
and
as
part
of
that
remedial
action
it
was
required
to
set
up
this
transfer
station
in
order
to
continue
to
have
responsibility
for
local
waste
service.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
justice
souter,
i
would
submit
that
those
are
relevant
questions
to
raise
in
the
context
of
whether
there's
a
rational
basis
for
the
regulation.
and
i
submit
that
they
would
be
raised
in
the
context
of
whether
this
town
is
actually
constitutionally
permitted
to
regulate
in
this
matter.
but
i
think
that
is
a
due
process...
substantive
due
process
issue.
i
don't
think
it's
a
commerce
clause
issue.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
your
honor,
if
it
is
a...
if
it
is
a
regulation
which
has
passed
muster
under
the...
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
if
it
is
deemed
to
have
a
rational
basis,
and
the
question
then
is
does
it,
nevertheless,
violate
the
commerce
clause
because
of
a
burden
that
it
imposes;
i
think
when
you
get
into
weighing
that
burden
against
the
legitimate
purposes
of
the
law,
we're
going
back
and
reevaluating
under
the...
under
the
rational
basis.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
i
agree.
that
is
the
additional--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--no,
your
honor,
no.
i
agree
completely
with
your
statement.
i
think
the
next...
the
commerce
clause
brings
to
the
table
the
discrimination
analysis.
a
law
which
is
otherwise
passing
muster
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
rationally
based,
we
then
move
to
the
commerce
clause
and
then
we
then
consider
whether
it
is
discriminatory.
because
then
we
have
the
aspect
of
regulating
the
unprotected
interests,
which
is
the
essence
of
economic
protectionism.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
we
have
the
unprotected
interests,
and
they
are
not
participating
in
the
political
process
that
produced
that
regulation,
and
therefore
they
should
not
be
bound
by
the
substantive
due
process
determination
that
the
court
has
made
in
that
case.
but
when
the
same
parties
who
are
protected
then
claim
the
burden...
which
is
this
case,
of
course;
carbone
is,
of
course,
a
local
clarkstown
interest
who
is
within
the
protected
interest...
then
there's
no
basis
for
the
claim
that
we
should
now
go
back
and
reevaluate
the
burden
on
commerce
in
comparison
to
the
local
benefits.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--no,
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
you
can
prohibit
them.
what
i'm
saying
is,
though,
if
you
are
looking
at
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
the
law,
you
are
not
concerned
about
the
burdens
on
the
local
people
as
much
as
you
are...
in
a
discrimination
analysis
you're
concerned
about
the
difference--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
you
can
prevent
local
people
from
dealing
in
interstate
commerce.
because,
i
mean,
the
question
would
be
how...
what
kind
of
law
would
you
pass
to
prevent
local
people
from
dealing
in
interstate
commerce?
it
would
have
to
be
some
kind
of
a
discriminatory
law
that
says
these
people
can
engage
in
commerce
and
these
people
can't.
what
the
clarkstown--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i
think...
i
think
the
hypothetical
of
all
people
must
buy
at
the
local
supermarket,
i
think
that
would
never
get
to
the
commerce
clause;
that
would
fall
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
the
question
of
requiring...
this
requiring
local
processing...
see,
that
is
what
exactly...
that
is
the
label
that
the
petitioners
attempted
to
put
on
this
case,
and
it
just
doesn't
fit.
the
question
is
local
processing
is
where
a
law
states
that
before...
as
in
the
shrimp
cases,
the
foster-fountain
case,
before
a
product
may
leave
this
jurisdiction
it
must
be
processed
by
local
processors.
the
sorting
is
on
the
basis
of
local
processors
versus
nonlocal
processors.
that's
not
what
this
law
does.
this
law
says
the
city
is
on
one
hand
and
all
other
participants
are
on
the
other
hand,
and
this
law
says
that
this
will
be
done
by
the
city
because
we
have
legitimate
police
power
reasons
to
do
so.
so--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--no,
no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--well,
your
honor,
one
of
the
reasons
is
the
ability
to
monitor...
monitor
the
waste.
in
this
town,
under
state
law
there
is
a
very
elaborate
requirement
for
recycling.
there
is
mandatory
local
recycling.
the
town
needs
to
have
the
ability
to
monitor
whether
the
recycling
is
actually
being
done.
there
are
concerns
about
traffic,
as
to
how--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--your
honor,
it
requires
the
town
to
have
recycling
laws
and
it...
i
don't
believe
it
mandates
a
particular...
it
certainly
doesn't
mandate
the
full
control.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
i'm
sorry...
does
it
mandate?
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
the
permit
granted
by
the
state
to
the
clarkstown
transfer
station
requires
it
to
make
certain
that
the
facilities
to
which
the
waste
goes
from
the
transfer
station
are
properly
permitted
and
appropriate
facilities.
in
that
sense--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--well,
your
honor,
the
basic
issue
of
is
there
an
environmental
justification
for
a
city
controlled,
city
monopolized
transfer
station,
again
i
don't
think...
i
think
if
that
judgment
is
made
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
city
to
use
that
method
to
advance
a
legitimate
interest
in
the
environment,
the
local
environment,
then
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
we
go
back
and
reevaluate
that
under
the
commerce
clause.
but,
nevertheless,
i
don't
mean
to
avoid
that
with
legal
argument,
and
not
talk
about
why
there
should
be
this
program.
it's
the
same
reason
for
the
program
in
san
francisco
in
1905
and
detroit
in
1905.
it's
the
same
reason
that
cities
since...
i
think
it's
1658
in
this
country,
in
new
amsterdam,
they
had
flow
control
laws.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
all
the
waste
was
taken
care
of
in
a
particular
way.
it's
the
entire
idea
of
control.
if
we
control
it,
if
we
know
where
it's
coming
from,
where
it's
going,
if
we
have
the
ability
to
actually
monopolize
and
have
responsibility,
then
we
will
know
that
the
waste
is
being
taken
care
of.
it's
very--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--your
honor--
[laughter]
that
is
a
major
point
that
the
petitioners
make,
but
it's
wrong.
some
garbage
is
valuable
if
it's
the
part
of
the
garbage
that
can
be
pulled
out
and
sold
for
recycling.
but
make
no
mistake
about
it,
the
waste
that
is
left
over
after
the
valuables
are
removed,
as
they
are
allowed
to
be
removed
and
shipped
out
anywhere
under
the
clarkstown
ordinance,
that
garbage
is
worth
less
today
than
it's
ever
been
worth,
because
the
cost
of
getting
rid
of
it
is
higher
than
it's
ever
been.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
rest
on
that,
because
i
think
that
the
economic
protectionism
analysis
that
i've
been
through
i
think
suffices
for
an
affirmance
of
this
case.
but
i
do
think
that
those
points
need
to
be
considered,
about
whether
it
is
an
article
of
commerce.
what
i
have
suggested
in
the
brief
is
that
there
are
three
doctrines
which
converge
on
that.
the
doctrine
of
basically
is
it
in
commerce
when
the
local
jurisdiction
essentially
has
a
separate
transaction
between
the
place
where
it's
discarded
and
the
place
where
it
is...
comes
to
the
transfer
station.
the
second,
i
think
the
quarantine
cases
have
application
here,
because
the
idea
of
the
quarantine
cases...
and
it's
a
nondiscriminatory
quarantine...
is
basically
to
say
this
is
something
we
consider
dangerous
to
the
local
community.
certainly,
garbage
is
dangerous
if
it's
not
properly
attended
to,
and
therefore
we
are
going
to
take
it
out
of
the
process
of
commerce.
and
the
third
is
from
the
sporhase
case,
the
argument
that
the
court
has
recognized,
as
it
did
in
that
case,
that
you
will
take
into
consideration
what
private
rights
the
state
has
given
to
engage
in
a
particular
business
such
as
the
removal
of
groundwater.
for
those
reasons,
i
do
urge
the
court
to
consider
whether
one
approach
to
this
case
is
to
consider
that
the
effect
of
the
city's
monopolizing
this
business,
taking
over
in
effect,
requiring
the
waste
to
be
treated
in
this
way
is,
in
effect,
removing
it
or
withholding
it,
if
you
would,
from
commerce.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
your
honor,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
suggests
it's
not
practically
feasible.
indeed--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--yes,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
that's
right.
your
honor,
let
me
give
an
example
of
that.
under
the
clarkstown
law
and
under
new
york
law,
every
business
and
every
resident
is
now
required
to
recycle.
the
city
provides
each
resident,
each
business
with
bins
in
which
they
will
put
the
different
recyclables.
and
this
is
mandated.
the
city
operates
composting
facilities.
this
is
all
part
of
the
overall
environmental
plan
that's
involved
here.
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
a
transfer
station.
the
city
picks
up
white
goods,
discarded
refrigerators
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
the
point
is
that
each
business...
if
you
imagine
an
alley
with
three
entrances
and
three
cans.
you
know,
one's
a
supermarket,
one's
a
clothing
store,
and
another
is
carbone's
recycling
center,
and
each
one
of
them
is
required
to
recycle
and
each
one
of
them
is
required
to
put
out
the
residues.
and
the
city
law
says
that
when
that
happens,
those
residues
will
be
handled
in
a
particular
way
that
we
had
determined
to
be
environmentally
appropriate.
and
that
way
is
that
it
will
be
brought
to
a
designated
transfer
station
and
that
it
will
then
be
disposed
of
as
we
have
arranged
it.
it
is
no
difference.
in
fact,
if
the
court
were
to
say
that
the
town
needs
to
differentiate
this
waste
based
upon
the
fact
that
it
originated
out
of
the
town
of
clarkstown,
the
court
would,
in
effect,
be
doing...
requiring
the
city
to
do
what
it
has
struck
down
time
and
time
again,
as
in
philadelphia.
the
court
would
be
requiring
the
town
to
impose
a
geographic
classification.
it
would
be
a
complete
reversal
of
roles,
even
though
it
would
be
completely
arbitrary
and
irrational.
there's
no
difference.
as
carbone
himself
said,
it's
fungible,
it's
commingled,
and
yet
if
the...
if
the
argument
were
to
be
sustained
that
the
town
has
to
treat
this
waste
differently,
this
would
be,
in
effect,
imposing
a
geographic
classification--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--well,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--if
the
law...
i
believe...
i
believe
if
the
law
said
that
the
town
has
contracted
for
a
plant--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--to
pasteurize.
and
if
there
is
some
rational
basis
for
that
action,
to
carry
out
some
legitimate
public
purpose,
then--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
problem
with
dean
milk--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
problem
with
dean
milk
was
that
there
was
a
sorting
of
private
interest
based
upon
the
proximity
to
the
city.
in
other
words,
that
there
was,
in
fact...
those
who
were
within
that
protected
area
were
able
to
do
this
business,
those
private
economic
interests,
those
who
were
outside
of
that
area
were
not
permitted
to
do
that
business,
so
we
had
a
model
of
economic
protectionism.
now,
the
question
in
dean
milk
was
was
there
some
legitimate
basis
for
that
discrimination,
and
the
answer
was
no,
there
was...
so
i
don't
think
that's
the
same
case.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
your
honor,
if
the
clarkstown
law
specified
that
all
garbage
had
to
be
processed
within
5
miles
of
clarkstown,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
c.
brashares
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a...
there's
an
argument
there.
i
think
to
meet
the
unmistakably
clear
standard
is
difficult,
and
i
think
it's
a
much
less
compelling
argument
than
the
other
arguments
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
close,
if
i
may...
refer
the
court
to
a
case
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
an
opinion
by
judge
stapleton
of
the
third
circuit
which...
and
if
i
don't
finish
this
by
the
red
light,
i
invite
the
court
to
finish.
in
the...
quote:
in
the
absolute
sense,
virtually
all
state
regulation
burdens
interstate
commerce.
where
the
burden
on
out-of-state
interests
is
no
different
from
that
placed
on
competing
in-state
interests,
however,
it
is
a
burden
on
commerce
rather
than
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
in
such
cases,
nothing
in
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
entitles
out-of-state
interests
to
more
strict
judicial
review
than
that
to
which
the
in-state
interests
are
entitled,
i.e.
arbitrary
and
capricious
review
under
the
due
process
clause
and
rational
basis
review
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
neither
of
which
involves
the
kind
of
social
value
balancing
that
norfolk
southern
urges
us
to
undertake.
and
last,
i'd
like
to
urge
the--
mr.
william
c.
brashares
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
that
was
from
norfolk
southern
against
oberly,
which
is
822
fed
2nd,
page
388.
the
quote
is
on
page
406.
i
apologize.
it's
referred
to
in
our
brief.
and
last,
we
did
not
cite,
and
i
would
like
to
urge
the
court
to
consider
in
this
case
the
bryard
against
city
of
alexandria
case
in
terms
of
the
effect
of
a
local
regulation
on
an
interstate
business.
there
the
court
said...
recognized,
exactly
as
i
urge
it
should
recognize
here,
that
the
fact
that
an
interstate
business
is
involved
does
not
remove
the
fact
that
the
local
activity
that
is
being
regulated
is
indistinguishable
from
the
local
activity
of
the
same
kind.
in
that
case
the
court
recognized
that
it
made
no
difference
whether
the
solicitor
coming
to
the
door
was
local
or
was
from
interstate
commerce.
the
fact
was
that
the
evil,
or
the
situation
that
the
local
legislation
was
attempting
to
deal
with
and
which
the
court
felt
was
rationally
based
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
was
the
exact
same
problem
presented
by
the
local
solicitor
and
the
out-of-state
solicitor,
and
the
state
and
the
local
community
had
no
obligation
to
differentiate
on
the
basis
of
its
regulation.
thank
you
very
much.
