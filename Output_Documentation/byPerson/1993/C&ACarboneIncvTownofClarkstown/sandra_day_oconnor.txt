well,
now,
ms.
christian,
you
started
to
tell
us
how
the
ordinance
applies.
now,
does
the
city
prohibit
you
from
shipping
the
waste
on
out--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
is
it
a
matter
of
requiring
you
to
pay
the
charge
before
you
ship
it
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
after
it's
sorted
and
in
the
city's
facility,
or
processed
in
the
city's
facility,
and
if
you
pay
the
charge
to
the
city,
then
can
you
ship
what
remains
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
petitioners
are
in
the
business
of
disposing
of
waste
and
they
can
do
it
more
cheaply
if
they
don't
have
to
submit
it
to
the
town
processing.
is
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--now,
does
the
town
impose
that
if
you
pick
up
waste
from
another...
from
outside
the
town
and
simply
transport
it
through
the
town
without
any
further
treatment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
apply
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
town.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
all
right.
well,
now
the
town
treats
everyone
alike,
whether
you're
inside
or
outside
the
town,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
there
some
municipal
functions
that
the
municipality
can
undertake
as
a
monopoly
and
impose
its
will
on
everyone,
like
sewage
disposal
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
a
municipality
have
a
monopoly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
one
amicus
brief
has
suggested
that
congress,
in
other
legislation,
has
basically
directed
this
kind
of
a
flow
control
ordinance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
rest
your
argument
in
part,
then,
on
the
notion
that
what
is
left,
and
what
is
at
issue
here,
has
no
value
and
is
not
an
article
of
commerce?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you--
--yes,
but--
--you
say
the
ordinance
applies
only
to
trash
discarded
in
the
city.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
applies
to
discarded
trash
and
you
say
we
don't
discard.
is
that
what
you're...
is
that
your
point?
