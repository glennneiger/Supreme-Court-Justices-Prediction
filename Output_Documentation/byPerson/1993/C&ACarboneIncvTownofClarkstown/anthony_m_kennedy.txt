justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
if
the
city
engaged
in
the
hypothetical
function
that
you
were
just
discussing
with
justice
o'connor,
so
that
it
owned
the
trash
facility
and
collected
it,
could
it
enforce
its
monopoly
by
a
criminal
sanction?
i
mean
like
something
like...
approaching
the
springfield
ordinance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
the
latter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
this
case
the
city
had
advertised
widely
for
bids
for
a
transfer
facility
and
awarded
the
transfer
facility
to
an
out-of-state
company
at
an
out-of-state
site?
so
you
have
roughly
this
case,
except
the
transfer
facility
is
out
of
state,
would
you
then
have
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
call
that
protectionism
or
simply
the
state
exceeding
its
appropriate
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
why
isn't
it
a
discrimination
against
exporters?
yeah.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wait
a
minute.
does
new
york
require
this
town
to
monitor
recycling
in
other
new
york
facilities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
doesn't
mandate...
it
doesn't
mandate
the
town
to
go
out
and
inspect
other
facilities
other
than
its
own,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
ordinance,
or
new
york
law
does
not
require
clarkstown
to
monitor
what
happens
to
its
trash
in
facilities
that
are
outside
of
its
jurisdiction,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that
can...
that
can
be
handled
by
other
facilities.
so
you
don't
need
a
local
facility
to
accomplish
the
end
that
you're...
that
you're
addressing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
our
civilization
has
advanced
to
the
point
where
garbage
is
valuable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
c
&
a
carbone,
inc.
versus
the
town
of
clarkstown,
no.92-1402.
as
solid
waste
output
continues
apace
and
landfill
capacity
becomes
more
costly
and
scares.
state
and
local
governments
are
expanding
significant
resources
to
develop
trash
control
systems
that
are
efficient,
lawful,
and
protective
of
the
environment.
the
difficulty
of
their
task
is
evident
from
the
number
of
cases
this
court
has
served
involving
waste
transfer
and
treatment.
this
case
considers
a
measure
commonly
called
a
flow
control
ordinance.
the
town
of
clarkstown,
which
is
located
in
southern
new
york
near
the
new
jersey
boarder,
enacted
the
flow
control
ordinance
to
ensure
that
the
transfer
station
that
it
caused
to
be
built
would
be
a
profitable
enterprise.
the
ordinance
requires
all
solid
wastes
to
be
processed
at
one
designated
transfer
station
before
leaving
the
municipality.
the
transfer
station
charged
a
fee
for
disposal
of
unsorted
solid
waste
in
excess
of
the
fee
charge
in
the
private
market.
in
other
words,
all
of
the
waste
had
to
go
to
one
transfer
station
and
that
transfer
station
charged
more
than
the
market
rate
for
processing.
as
part
of
this
arrangement,
the
contractor
who
built
the
transfer
station
agreed
to
operate
it
for
five
years
and
then
sell
it
to
the
town
for
$1.
the
flow
control
ordinance,
thus,
serve
to
amortize
the
cost
for
clarkstown
to
construct
its
own
waste
transfer
facility.
the
town
filed
suit
in
new
york
state
court
against
c
&
a
carbone,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
a
solemn
injunction
requiring
carbone
to
use
the
designated
transfer
station
rather
than
carbone's
own
facility
in
clarkstown.
the
court
granted
the
injunction
and
the
appellate
division
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
the
flow
control
ordinance
violates
the
commerce
clause.
it
is
well-established
that
the
commerce
clause
prohibits
local
laws
that
impose
commercial
barriers
that
discriminate
against
an
article
of
commerce
by
reason
of
its
origin
or
destination
out
of
state.
clarkstown
protest
that
its
ordinance
does
not
discriminate
because
it
does
not
differentiate
solid
waste
on
the
basis
of
its
geographic
origin.
all
solid
waste,
regardless
of
its
origin,
must
be
processed
at
the
designated
transfer
station
before
it
leaves
the
town.
but
this
argument
misconceives
the
relevant
article
of
commerce
in
the
case.
as
the
town
itself
points
out,
what
makes
garbage
a
profitable
enterprise
is
not
its
own
worth
but
the
fact
that
its
possessor
must
pay
to
get
rid
of
it.
in
other
words,
the
article
of
commerce
is
not
so
much
the
solid
waste
itself
but
rather
the
service
of
processing
and
disposing
of
it.
with
respect
to
this
stream
of
commerce,
the
flow
control
ordinance
discriminates.
it
allows
only
the
favorite
operator
to
process
waste
that
is
within
the
town
limits.
it
is
just
one
more
instance
of
local
processing
requirements
that
we
have
long
held
invalid.
the
essential
vice
in
laws
of
this
sort
is
that
they
bar
the
import
of
the
processing
service,
they
horde
a
local
resource
for
the
benefit
of
local
businesses
that
treat
it.
the
flow
control
ordinance
has
the
same
design
and
effect.
this
sort
of
discrimination
is
per
se
invalid,
save
in
the
narrow
class
of
cases
in
which
the
municipality
can
demonstrate
under
rigorous
scrutiny
that
it
has
no
other
means
to
advance
a
legitimate
local
interest.
but
here,
clarkstown
has
a
number
of
non-discriminatorial
alternatives
for
addressing
the
health
and
environmental
problems
alleged
to
justify
the
ordinance
in
question.
state
and
local
governments
may
not
use
their
regulatory
power
to
favor
local
enterprise
by
prohibiting
patronage
of
out
of
state
competitors
or
their
facilities.
because
the
town
of
clarkstown
has
attempted
to
do
so
through
the
flow
control
ordinance
in
this
case,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
division
and
remand
the
case
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
decision.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
blackmun
join.
