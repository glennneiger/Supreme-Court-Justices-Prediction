justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
ms.
foster,
i
thought
the
jury
was
instructed
in
instruction
8
that
regardless
of
the
form
of
verdict,
in
any
case
the
jury
had
to
find
that
the
defendant
engaged
in
the
conduct
which
caused
the
death,
and
that
when
the
defendant
did
so
he
knew
the
conduct
would
or
intended
it
to
cause
the
death.
i
thought
that
was
the
instruction
given,
among
others.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
it
is
not
so
limited.
was
instruction
8
given
to
the
jury
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
appeared
to
be
understood
by
counsel
for
both
the
state
and
the
defendant
that
intent
was
required
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
forms
of
verdict,
and
wasn't
that
so
found?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
the
arguments...
the
arguments
made
to
the
jury
by...
both
counsel
indicated
that
understanding,
and
it
would
certainly
be
consistent
with
instruction
8,
as
i
read
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
at
a...
at
a
bare
minimum,
you
would
have
to
be
concede
that
the
courts
below
haven't
found
to
the
contrary
of
what
i
said
to
you.
there's
been
no
finding
in
the
courts
below
that
the
jury
was
instructed
as
you
argue,
only
from
instruction
4
rather
than
instruction
8.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
had
asked
you
whether
the
jury
was
given
instruction
8
telling
them
they
had
to
find
intent
regardless,
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
court
below
has
said
that
eight
was
inapplicable
to
the
finding
under
the
form
of
verdict
that
was
returned
here.
i
don't
think
any
of
the
lower
courts
have
said
that,
have
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
appeared
that...
i
mean,
you
may
be
right
under
terms
of
state
law.
it
just
appeared
that
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
they
had
to
do
that,
for
whatever
reason.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
true
that
counsel
for
the
state,
as
well
as
the
defendant,
thought
that
only
one
form
of
verdict
could
be
returned?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
certainly
mentioned
in
their
arguments
to
the
jury,
though,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
he'd
been
convicted.
the
jury
had
come
in
with
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
count
i
and
then
at
the
sentencing
phase
the
state
wanted
to
prove
that
it
was
done
in
the
course
of
a
rape,
as
a...
as
an
aggravator.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
double
jeopardy
here
because
they
didn't
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
felony
murder.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
states'
call
it
either
way
here,
on
double
jeopardy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
price
and
green
on
the
implied
acquittal
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the...
if
that
had
been
done
and
the
finding
had
come
back
not
guilty
on
the
first
count,
the
intentional
murder,
then
would
there
be
a
collateral
estoppel
problem
at
sentencing
if
you
tried
to
prove
intentional
murder
as
an
aggravator
for
sentencing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ashe
v.
swenson,
though,
has
language
that
is
troublesome,
i
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioner
killed
a
young
woman
and
was
charged
with
three
counts
of
murder.
in
count
one,
he
was
charged
with
knowing
or
intentional
murder.
in
count
two,
he
was
charged
with
murder
while
committing
rape.
in
count
three,
he
was
charged
with
murder
while
committing
deviant
sexual
conduct.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
count
two,
murder
while
committing
rape,
but
left
the
remaining
verdict
sheets
blank.
at
an
advisory
sentencing
hearing,
the
jury
recommended
against
capital
punishment.
the
trial
judge
rejected
the
jury's
sentencing
recommendation
and
imposed
a
death
sentence
finding
that
the
state
had
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
statutory
aggravating
factor
that
petitioner
had
committed
the
murder
by
intentionally
killing?
[01:21

...writ
of
habeas
corpus
holding
that
the
sentence
of
death
did
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
also
affirm.
although
this
court
has
discretion
to
reach
the
state's
argument
that
granting
relief
to
petitioner
would
require
retroactive
application
of
a
new
rule
in
violation
of
the
principle
announced
in
teague
against
lane,
we
will
not
do
so
in
this
case
where
the
state
did
not
raise
the
teague
argument
in
the
lower
courts
or
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
the...
[01:58
audio
cut]
...circumstance.
because
the
sentencing
proceeding
amounted
to
a
successive
prosecution
for
intentional
murder
in
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
we
hold
today
that
the
capital
sentencing
proceeding
did
not
amount
to
a
successive
prosecution.
because
a
second
sentencing
proceeding
following
retrial
ordinarily
is
constitutional,
an
initial
sentencing
proceeding
following
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
does
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
petitioner
also
argues
that
the
jury
acquitted
him
of
intentional
murder
when
it
failed
to
return
a
verdict
on
count
one,
and
that
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
prohibited
the
trial
court's
use
of
the
intentional
murder
aggravating
circumstance
as
a
basis
for
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
we
hold
that
the
petitioner
has
not
met
his
burden
of
establishing
the
factual
predicate
for
the
application
of
the
collateral
estoppel
doctrine,
namely,
that
the
jury
found
in
his
favor
on
the
issue
of
intent.
an
examination
of
the
record
shows
that
the
trial
court's
instructions
on
the
issue
of
intent
to
kill
were
ambiguous
and
that
it
is
unclear
whether
the
jury
believed
it
could
return
more
than
one
verdict.
therefore,
the
jury's
failure
to
return
a
verdict
on
count
one
does
not
show
that
it
found
the
petitioner
lacked
an
intent
to
kill.
justice
blackmun

a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
stevens
has

a
dissenting
opinion

which
justice
blackmun

joined.
