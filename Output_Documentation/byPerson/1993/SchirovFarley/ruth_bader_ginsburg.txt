justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
foster,
you're
giving
a
very
complicated
analysis,
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
defense
counsel,
as
well
as
the
prosecutor,
told
the
jury...
and
this
is
appendix
page
17
of
brief
for
respondent.
mr.
keating
said
to
the
jury:
"you'll
have
to
go
back
there
and
try
to
figure
out
which
one
of
8
or
10
verdicts.
"
which
one.
so
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
defense
attorney
both
told
the
jury
pick
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
foster,
are
you
confusing--
--in
cases
of
lesser
included
offenses.
both
price
and
green
involved
lesser
included
offenses,
did
they
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
difference
between
subjecting
a
person
to
jeopardy
and
acquitting
a
person?
you
can't
be
put
in
jeopardy
twice.
the
state
can't
have
you
run
the
gauntlet
and
then
say
oh,
wait
a
minute,
we
think
we
can
make
an
even
stronger
case,
so
we're
going
to
call
this
trial
off
and
start
over
again
without
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury.
that
person
would
have
been
in
jeopardy
and
could
not
be
tried
again,
and
yet
there
would
have
been
no
acquittal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
putting
a
person
in
jeopardy
is
not
the
same...
i
mean,
you
can
put
a
person
in
jeopardy
and
there'd
be
no
acquittal.
why
isn't
that
what
happened
here?
he
was
put
in
jeopardy,
so
he
can't
be
tried
again
for
that
offense,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
jury
acquitted
him
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
treated
the
same
in
the
sense
that
you
can't
try
the
person
for
that
crime
again,
but
it's
not
the
equivalent
of
an
acquittal,
which
is
the
determination
of
an
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
foster,
did
you
check
in
those
cases
whether
there
was
the
kind
of
instruction
that
was
involved
in
instruction
8,
where
the
jury
was
told
for
murder...
seemed
to
think
that
murder,
without
defining
felony
murder,
premeditated,
that
all
of
them
required
an
intent,
or
where
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
says
pick
one?
in
those
cases
that
you
cite
in
that
footnote,
did
we
have
that
kind
of
presentation
to
the
jury
where
counsel
says
pick
one
and
the
judge
gives
the
same
charge
for...
without
differentiating?
or
in
those
cases
did
the
judge
discreetly
say
this
is
what's
required
for
felony
murder,
this
is
what's
required
for
premeditated
murder,
and
did
the
attorneys
in
their
summation
make
clear
that
the
jury
could
find
more
than
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
instruction
was
not
given
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
take
it
your
answer
is
no,
they
didn't
have
the
kind
of,
perhaps
misleading
under
state
law,
picture
that
was
presented
in
this
case,
or
at
least
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
all
hypothetical.
you
don't
know.
you
don't
know
what
he
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
just
ask
you
one
thing
that
i
find
so
troublesome
about
your
double
jeopardy,
that
you
propose
to
your
issue-preclusion
argument.
am
i
right
that
if
you
are
correct,
then
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
have
got
to
be
unconstitutional
when
they
allow
a
judge
at
the
sentencing
stage
to
take
into
account
a
crime
of
which
the
defendant
was,
in
fact,
acquitted.
not
where
the
jury
was
simply
silent
but
the
jury
acquits,
and
then
at
sentencing
the
judge
says
but
i
think
that
was
shown
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
so
i
am
going
to
put
you
into
a
higher
penalty
category,
because
i
find
that
you
committed
that
crime.
is
your
double
jeopardy...
doesn't
your
double
jeopardy
argument
say
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
the
jury
acquitted
the
person
of
the
conduct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
the
sentencing
stage...
if
that
acquittal
carries
over
to
a
sentencing
and
a
sentencing
is
treated
just
like
another
trial,
then
why
doesn't
that
follow?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
claim
is
precluded...
the
claim
is
precluded.
we're
not
talking
about
precluding
on
a
particular
issue.
that's
the
second
argument
that
you
make.
i'm
talking
about
your
larger
double
jeopardy
argument
that
says
you
can't...
convicted,
acquitted,
you
can't
bring
this
matter
up
again.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
isn't
the
question.
the
question
is
would
your
client
suffer
in
any
respect
if
you
as,
or
your
person
who's
defense
counsel
says
judge,
i
want
you
to
tell
the
jury
on
each
of
these
counts
and
give
them
a
verdict
form
that
says
guilty...
check
either
guilty
or
not
guilty
in
each
case,
or
would
you...
wouldn't
you
prefer,
as
defense
counsel,
to
leave
the
possibility
of
the
jury
not
saying
anything?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
wouldn't
be
this
question
of
guessing
if
the
judge
had
said
in
each...
for
each
one
of
these
counts,
check
off
either
guilty
or
not
guilty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
as
defense
counsel,
you
would
have
asked
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
isn't...
it
isn't
a
requirement
for
double
jeopardy.
it
is
a
requirement
for
issue
preclusion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
you
don't...
don't
have
to...
if
you
decided
the
case
in
double
jeopardy,
you
don't
have
to
have
specific
findings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
abel,
this
whole
problem
would
have
been
obviated,
would
it
not,
if
the
verdict
form
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury
had
asked
the
jury
yes/no
on
each
of
the
counts?
then
we
would
know
whether
they...
if
they
had
an
option
say
yes
or
no.
but
they
didn't
get
that,
and
the
prosecutor
told
them
you're
only
allowed
to
return
one
verdict.
the
appropriate
charge
for
you
to
return
is
on
murder
in
the
conduct
of
a
rape.
so
the
jury
gave
the
prosecutor
what
the
prosecutor
asked
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
it...
wouldn't
it
have
been...
for
the
purposes
of
clarity
and
to
avoid
an
appeal,
wouldn't
it
have
been
appropriate
for
the...
for
the
prosecutor
to
say
to
the
judge,
give
the
jury
a
form
which
will
make
it
clear
to
them
that
they
can...
that
they
should...
not
that
they
must,
but
that
they
should
find
yes
or
no
on
each
count?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
are
here.
and
this...
in
civil
proceedings
if
you
have
an
equitable
relief...
damages
and
equitable
relief,
same
proceeding,
and
the
jury
finds
damages,
that
finding
binds
the
judge
with
respect
to
equitable
relief.
so
i
don't
understand
your
argument
that
issue
preclusion
doesn't
apply.
i
thought
your
whole
point
about
issue
preclusion
was
there
was
no
finding,
but
now
you've
gave...
given
the
answer
that
double
jeopardy
is
out
of
this
picture
altogether,
issue
preclusion
is
out
of
it
altogether.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
some
issue
preclusion
is
raised,
litigated,
and
decided,
so
what's
the...
i
don't
understand...
and
i
thought
your
whole
point
throughout
is
it
wasn't
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
now
you're
saying
even
if
it
was
decided,
it
would
still...
could
be
decided
again
by
the
judge,
in
a
way...
in
conflict
with
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
argument
was
it
was
academic
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
finding,
and
for
issue
preclusion
that
you
must
have
a
finding?
