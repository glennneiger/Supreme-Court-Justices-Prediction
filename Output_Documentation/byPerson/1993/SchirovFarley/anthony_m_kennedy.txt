justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
you
began
by
saying
that
he
was
acquitted.
isn't
that
one
of
the
issues
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you're
talking
about
collateral
estoppel,
not
double
jeopardy.
that's
your
argument.
i
think
if
you're
going
to
say
double
jeopardy,
you
have
to...
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
he's
been
put
to
the
pain,
the
agony,
the
ordeal
of
having
to
defend
against
the
rape
charge
a
second
time.
it's
double
jeopardy,
you
can't
do
it.
but
you
don't
take
that
position
apparently.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
question
of
a
second
trial
for
this...
for
the
same
facts.
we're
talking
about
the
sentencing
phase.
your
case
separates
out
the
sentencing
phase,
and
the
elements
no
longer
make
a
difference
when
you're
just
talking
about
the
sentencing
phase.
in
the
sentencing
phase,
they're
trying
to
introduce
the
proof
of
a
rape.
it...
the
elements
of
that
proof
at
the
sentencing
phase
are
the
same
as
the
elements
of
the
rape
that
he's
been
convicted
of.
i
don't...
i
don't
see
why
you
wouldn't...
if
you
believe
in
double
jeopardy,
you
would
have
to
say,
no,
that
rape
could
not
be
introduced
in
the
sentencing
phase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
the
verdict
forms
separate?
they
weren't
all
on
one
sheet,
as
printed
in
the
appendix
here?
was
there
a
separate
sheet
of
paper
for
each
possible
verdict?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'll
check
the
record
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
guides
the
court?
the
jury
comes
in
guilty
on
counts
i,
ii,
and
iii.
what
does
the
court
enter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whatever
it
wants?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
in
this
case
would
be
count
iii
because...
i
guess
count
iii,
because
that
was
the
capital
charge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ii
and
iii.
