ms.
monica
foster
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
thomas
schiro
was
acquitted
of
mens
rea
murder
at
the
guilt
trial.
the
case
then
proceeded
to
the
penalty
trial
where
the
jury
unanimously
recommended
against
the
death
penalty
in
61
minutes.
ms.
monica
foster
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
ms.
monica
foster
yes,
justice
kennedy,
and
i'm
getting
to
that.
ms.
monica
foster
the
judge
overrode
the
penalty
recommendation,
but
more
importantly
in
our
case,
the
guilt
trial
verdict
and
imposed
the
death
penalty,
finding
that
schiro
had
committed
mens
rea
murder
during
the
course
of
a
rape.
we
know
that
schiro
was
acquitted
of
mens
rea
murder
for
four
reasons.
those
reasons
depend
largely
upon
the
three
separate
charges
filed
in
this
case
and
the
verdict
forms
that
the
jury
had
received.
the
state
separately
charged
three
counts
of
murder
for
the
death
of
a
single
person,
as
is
common
in
indiana.
count
i,
mens
rea
murder,
charged
that
schiro
knowingly
killed
the
victim.
charges
2
and
3
each
charged
separate
counts
of
felony
murder.
those
counts
did
not
require
that
the
state
demonstrate
any
mens
rea
as
to
the
killing,
but
did
require
that
the
state
demonstrate
an
underlying
felony
rape
and
criminal
deviate
conduct,
respectively.
ms.
monica
foster
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
the--
ms.
monica
foster
--justice...
justice
o'connor,
that
instruction
goes
to
count
i
only.
it
does
not
apply--
ms.
monica
foster
--yes,
absolutely,
it
was.
ms.
monica
foster
that--
ms.
monica
foster
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
final
instruction
number
4
told
the
jury
what
the
separate
elements
for
mens
rea
murder
were
and
what
the
elements
for
felony
murder
were.
final
instruction
8
clearly
cannot...
it
cannot
apply
to
the
felony
murder
count
because
the
jury
was
instructed
in
final
4
that
in
order
to
sustain
a
conviction
for
felony
murder,
the
jury
had
to
find
an
underlying
felony.
and
yet
final
instruction
8,
we
see
nothing
in
there
that
requires
the
jury
to
find
the
underlying
felony.
additionally,
final
instruction
8
does
on
to
say
if
you
find
from
your
consideration
of
all
of
the
evidence
that
each
of
these
propositions
was
proven
and
that
the
defendant
was
not
legally
insane
at
the
time,
then
you
should
find
him
guilty.
that
instruction
simply
applies
to
the
count
i
mens
rea
murder
only,
and
does
not--
ms.
monica
foster
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
what
your
question
is.
ms.
monica
foster
no,
no
court
has
said
that
8
was
inapplicable.
but
the
law
in
indiana
clearly
is
that
the...
to
sustain
a
verdict
for
mens
rea
murder,
as
was
charged
here,
you
have
to
show
an
intent
to
kill.
to
sustain
a
guilty
verdict
for
felony
murder,
there
is
no
necessity
of
showing
an
intent
to
kill.
additionally--
ms.
monica
foster
--well,
the
judge
did
give
final
instruction
number
8.
but
if
we
look
at
the
verdict
forms
too,
the
verdict
forms
talk
in
terms
of
"as
charged
in
count
i
of
the
information.
"
clearly,
count
i
did
not
charge
the
felonies
and
can't...
you
know,
in
the
verdict
forms
when
the
court
refers
to
"as
charged
in
count
ii
of
the
information.
"
count
ii
did
not
charge
an
intent
element
as
to
the
killing.
ms.
monica
foster
no,
absolutely
not.
ms.
monica
foster
the
prosecutor's
arguments
and
his
one
verdict
comments
come
at
a
point
in
the
proceedings
where
the
prosecutor
gets
to
get
up
a
second
time
and
deliver
his
closing
argument.
he
did
not
argue
that
the
jury
should
return
but
one
verdict
in
his
initial
closing
argument.
ms.
monica
foster
no,
justice...
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
did
not.
ms.
monica
foster
correct.
getting
back
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
the
prosecutor...
the
trial
prosecutor
makes
his
one
verdict
comments
only
after
defense
counsel
interjects
his
postmortem
defense
to
count
iii,
that
the
jury
should
not
find
schiro
guilty
of
count
iii
because
the
criminal
deviate
conduct
occurred
after
death.
the
comments
made
by
the
prosecutor
would
be
interpreted
by
a
reasonable
jury
as
saying
you
don't
have
to
find
schiro
guilty
on
count
iii.
the
trial
prosecutor
concedes
that
the
criminal
deviate
conduct
occurred
after
death,
and
then
says
that
mr.
keating,
defense
counsel,
makes
an
interesting
argument.
the
prosecutor's
comments
would
be
understood
by
the
jury
as
indicating
that
it
was
okay
with
the
state
if
the
jury
did
not
return
a
verdict
on
count
iii,
and
that
the
state
did
not
necessarily
lose
their
case
so
long
as
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
on
counts
i
and
ii.
ms.
monica
foster
the
defense
counsel
was
arguing
that
one
verdict
was
the
only
proper
number
of
verdicts
that
should
be
returned
in
this
case
because
he
was
arguing
for
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
additionally,
as
this
court
said
in
donnelley
v.
dechristofero,
when
we're
looking
at
closing
arguments,
closing
arguments
that
are
generally
relatively
spontaneous,
that
we
will
not
attribute
the
most
damaging
interpretation
to
an
ambiguous
remark.
defense
counsel
was
asking
for
one
verdict,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
additionally,
as
we
demonstrated
in...
i
believe
it's
footnote
18
of
our
reply
brief,
it's
conceivable
that...
that
part
of
what's
happening
with
defense
counsel's
comments
is
a
difference
in
punctuation
by
the
stenographer.
defense
counsel
could
have
said,
you'll
have
to
go
back
there
and
try
and
figure
out
which
one
of
8
or
10
verdicts.
i
believe
there
are
10
that
you
will
return
back
into
this
court.
as
this
court
stated
in
donnelley,
we
just
can't
attribute
the
most
damaging
interpretation
to
ambiguous
remarks,
and
i
think
that
what...
clearly
what
the
prosecutor
is
saying
is
you
don't
have
to
return
a
guilty
verdict
on
each
count.
the
prosecutor
conceded
count
iii.
we
know
that
schiro
was
acquitted
of
mens
rea
murder
for
four
reasons.
first
of
all,
this
jury
had
an
unimpeded
opportunity
to
convict
schiro.
this
jury
was
given
separate
verdict
forms...
separate
guilty
verdict
forms
on
each
of
the
separately
charged
counts
of
murder.
the
jury
signed
and
returned
only
that
count
which
applied...
which
found
schiro
guilty
of
count
ii,
and
did
not
sign
the
mens
rea
murder
form
or
the
felony
murder
during
a
criminal
deviate
conduct.
ms.
monica
foster
because,
as
this
court's
precedents
in
price
and
green
establish,
a
silent
verdict
is
the
constitutional
equivalent
of
an
acquittal
if
either
the
jury
had
the
opportunity
to
convict
and
did
not
or
because
the
jury
intended
to
acquit
and--
ms.
monica
foster
--i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it's
questionable
whether
the
offenses
at
issue
in
green
concerned
lesser
included
offenses.
in
footnote
14,
the
court
says
that
an...
an
argument
is
made
that
these
are
not
lesser
and
greater
offenses,
although
admittedly
the
lower
courts
had
found
that
they
were.
but
this
court
stated
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they're
lesser
or
greater
offenses,
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
when
we
look
at
double
jeopardy
principles,
a
defendant
has
an
interest
in
having
his
case
resolved
by
the
first
jury
impaneled
to
hear
it.
and
if
the
jury
is
given
an
opportunity
to
convict
and
does
not,
it
does
not
matter
whether
they're
lesser
or
greater
offenses.
ms.
monica
foster
the
court
said
in
footnote
14
specifically
that
the
argument...
that
the
offenses
at
issue
were
not...
lesser
or
greater
did
not
assist
the
government's
position
at
all.
in
fact,
if
they're
different
offenses,
that
green's
position
would,
in
fact,
be
stronger.
ms.
monica
foster
that's
exactly
correct.
ms.
monica
foster
well,
i
think
green
says
that
if
the
jury
has
the
opportunity
to
convict
and
does
not,
that
that
is
treated
the
same
as
an
acquittal.
but
if--
ms.
monica
foster
--i'm...
i
think
i
would
disagree
with
that.
i
think
that
it
is
treated
the
same
as
an
acquittal.
i
think
the
court
said
that
when
a
verdict...
when
a
jury
is
silent
after
they
have
had
either
the
opportunity
to
convict
and
have
not,
or
that
they
have
intended
to
acquit,
that
that
is
the
constitutional
equivalent
of
an
acquittal.
ms.
monica
foster
let
me
make
sure
that
i
understand
your--
ms.
monica
foster
--if
the
murder
charge
that
he
is...
if
the
state
convicts
him
of
rape,
then
comes
in
and
convicts
him
of
murder
during
the
course
of
a
rape,
what
we
would
call
in
indiana
felony
murder,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
ms.
monica
foster
okay.
yes,
that
would
be
double
jeopardy,
because
the
rape
is
a
lesser
included
of
the
felony
murder
rape.
i'm
assuming
by
your
hypothetical
that
we're
talking
about
different
proceedings
here.
ms.
monica
foster
intentional.
ms.
monica
foster
well,
if
he's
subsequently
charged
with
intentional
murder
then,
no,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
double
jeopardy
problem
there.
ms.
monica
foster
because
the
elements
are
not
the
same.
ms.
monica
foster
right.
but
the
elements
of...
you're
saying
tried
for
the
rape
in
one
proceeding.
ms.
monica
foster
then
separately
tried
for
intentional
murder,
what
we
would
all
mens
rea
murder.
ms.
monica
foster
no,
there's
no
double--
ms.
monica
foster
--yes.
ms.
monica
foster
he's
convicted
of
rape.
that's
very
different
than
being
acquitted.
ms.
monica
foster
yes,
it
is.
yes,
justice
scalia,
it
is.
ms.
monica
foster
in
the
hypothetical
that
you've
given
me,
he
is
convicted
of
two
different
things.
rape
and
intentional
murder
are
not
the
same
offense.
so,
yes,
it
would
be
okay
for
him
to
be
convicted
of
both
of
those
things.
ms.
monica
foster
well,
if
the...
if
the
elements
of
the
intentional
murder
are
different
than
the
elements
of
the
rape,
then
no.
ms.
monica
foster
i
think
that
the
element...
the
elements
do
make
a
difference.
for
our
argument,
what
has
happened
is
that
schiro
was
acquitted
of
the
mens
rea
murder
and
then
the
elements
of
that
were
used
at
the
sentencing
phase.
and
our
argument
is
that
that
violates
double
jeopardy.
ms.
monica
foster
and
there
had
been
no--
ms.
monica
foster
--if
he
was
convicted
on
count
i
and
the
jury
was
silent
as
to
count
ii,
yes,
that
would
be...
my
argument
is
that
that
would
be
a
double
jeopardy
violation
also.
ms.
monica
foster
no,
absolutely
not.
this
jury
had
an
opportunity
to
return
a
guilty
verdict
on
each
charge.
this...
the
state
charging
three
counts
of
murder
in
indiana
is
very
common,
as
demonstrated
by
our
footnote
12,
i
believe
it
is,
in
our
reply
brief.
when
the
jury
is
convinced
that
the
state
has
proven
the
elements
of
each
of
those
offenses
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
juries
in
indiana
return
guilty
verdicts
on
each
one
of
those
offenses.
there's
37
cases
in
footnote
12
where
defendants
were
charged,
similarly
to
mr.
schiro,
with
multiple
counts
of
murder
for
the
death
of
one
person,
and
the
jury
returned
verdicts
on...
on
both
counts.
ms.
monica
foster
justice
ginsburg,
the
opinions
in
those
cases
obviously
do
not
answer
the
question
that
you
have
just
asked,
but
i
have
looked
at
33
of
the
records
in
30...
in
those
37
cases.
in
11
of
the
cases...
in
11
of
the
33
cases,
the
jury
was
instructed
to
return
a
verdict
on
each
count,
guilty
or
not
guilty
on
each
count.
in
22
of
those
cases,
the--
ms.
monica
foster
--that
instruction
was
not
given
here,
that
is
correct.
in
22
of
those
cases,
the
jury
was
given
no
guidance
on
how
many
verdicts
to
return.
and
what
we
found
in
the
records
were
instructions
similar
to
instruction
8,
where
the
court
said
here
are
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
if
you
find
those
elements
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
you
should
return
a
guilty
verdict
on
that
count.
ms.
monica
foster
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
misleading
picture.
in
22
of
the
cases,
the
jury
did
not
receive
any
guidance
from
the
court
on
how
many
verdicts
to
return.
they
got
instructions
similar
to
instruction
8
that
said
here
are
the
elements;
if
you
find
these
elements
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
return
a
guilty
verdict.
ms.
monica
foster
the
transcript
of
those...
of
the
actual
words
that
the
judge
spoke
is
not
available.
it's
not
in
the
record.
this
is
the
extent--
ms.
monica
foster
--that's
correct.
ms.
monica
foster
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
either,
although
i
know
that...
that
the
practice
is
indiana
is,
in
general,
they
do.
but
we
do
not
know
whether
these
guilt
trial
instructions...
we
know
that
the
penalty
trial
instructions
went.
ms.
monica
foster
i
mean,
at
some...
at
some
points,
i
think,
in
the
instructions
he
refers
to
verdicts
and
offenses,
and
at
other
points
he
refers
to
offense.
i
mean,
i
think
that
there's
a
real
hodge-podge
going
on
here
of
what
he
refers
to.
however,
if
i
was
defense
counsel
and
the
judge
was
referring
to
numerous
verdicts
in
the
plural,
i
think
i
would
have
an
objection
to
that,
and
that's
that--
ms.
monica
foster
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
monica
foster
no,
justice
ginsburg.
and
i
don't
do
any
federal
trial
work,
so
correct
if
i'm
wrong,
but
what
i
heard
you
say
is--
ms.
monica
foster
--but
what
i
heard
you--
ms.
monica
foster
--am
i
not
correct
that
at
the
sentencing
stage,
that
the...
the
factor
only
needs
to
be
established
by
a
preponderance?
ms.
monica
foster
and
the
court
could
have
found...
i
mean,
it's
a
relative
burdens
case
that
the
state
didn't
prove--
ms.
monica
foster
--i
still...
my
answer
would
nevertheless
be
that
it's
a
relative
burdens,
that
the
distinction
is
relative
burdens.
ms.
monica
foster
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
stevens.
by
statute,
they've
got
to
prove
the
aggravator
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
monica
foster
the
bright
line
rule
that
you're
suggesting
is
that
defense
counsel
would
be
required
on
a
collateral
estoppel
claim
to
request
specific
findings
from
the
jury?
ms.
monica
foster
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here
today
if--
ms.
monica
foster
--well,
i
guess
my
initial
answer
would
be...
you
know,
the
state
supreme
court
didn't
find
any
sort
of
a
procedural
default,
and
that
sounds
to
me
like--
ms.
monica
foster
--well,
schiro's
counsel
would
have
had
no
notice
of
that
requirement.
to
my
knowledge,
you've
never
imposed
that
requirement
in
the
past,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
unfair
to
impose
it
at
this
point
and
oppose
it...
impose
it
upon
him
when
he
had
no
notice
that
that
was
a
part
and
parcel
of
a
collateral
estoppel
claim.
ms.
monica
foster
well,
i
think
in
our
case
that
there
is
a
bright
line
that
you
can
draw.
in
our...
assuming
that
there
is
an
acquittal
at
the
guilt
trial,
which
we
believe
that
you
should
find,
with
respect...
with
respect
to
why
the
jury
acquitted,
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
in
this
case
why
the
jury
acquitted
when
you
line
up
the
elements
of
felony
murder
as
against
the--
ms.
monica

--well,
standing
here
today--
ms.
monica
foster
--i
think
you're...
i
think
that
that
is
the
proper
thing
that
the
court
should
have
done.
ms.
monica
foster
i'm
not
sure.
ms.
monica
foster
well,
the
fact
is--
ms.
monica
foster
--the
state
filed
three
charges
and
i
think
the
jury
would
feel
duty
bound
to
return...
you
know,
to
give
the
state
an
answer
on
each
of
their
three
charges.
ms.
monica
foster
because,
as
demonstrated
in
footnote
12,
juries
in
indiana
routinely
do
come
back
with
verdicts
on
each
count.
because
it
makes
sense
that
the
jury
would
have...
the
jury
was
not
told
to
just
return
one
verdict
by
the
court.
it
makes
sense
that
the
jury
would
have
approached
their
obligations
in
the
order
in
which
the
charges
were
submitted
to
them,
one,
two,
three.
we
know
that
the
jury
was
considering
count
iii
because
they
had
a
question
during
deliberations
that
went
only
to
count
iii.
ms.
monica
foster
thank
you.
