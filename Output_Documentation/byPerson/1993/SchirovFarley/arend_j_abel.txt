mr.
arend
j.
abel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner's
claims
in
this
case
fail
for
each
of
the
four
following
reasons.
first,
whatever
else
is
clear
about
the
record
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
it
does
not
show
an
actual
determination
on
the
issue
of
intent
in
petitioner's
favor,
which
is
a
necessary
requirement
because
this
is
really
a
collateral
estoppel,
rather
than
a
double
jeopardy
claim.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
it
is
most
certainly
a
requirement
for
issue
preclusion.
there
are
other
issues
that
come
up
in
the
double
jeopardy
context,
you're
correct.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
in
many
double
jeopardy
cases
you
would
not.
and
for...
because
the
implied
acquittal
doctrine
would
not
apply
where
you've
got
multiple
charges
of
the
same
offense,
we
believe
that
if
this
were
viewed
as
a
double
jeopardy
case,
he
still
would
have
to,
at
a
minimum,
show
that
the
jury
intended
to
acquit
him.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
that's
correct.
and
that
is,
indeed,
the
third
point,
which
is
that
double
jeopardy
deals
with
successive
prosecutions;
it
does
not
deal
with
the
relationship
between
different
stages
of
a
single
capital
trial.
there
might
be
other
things
in
the
constitution
that
would
prevent
that
result,
but
certainly
it
would
not
be
either
double
jeopardy
or
collateral
estoppel
growing
out
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
the
fourth
point
is--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--i'm
sorry.
the
second
point
was
that
the
implied
acquittal
doctrine
simply
does
not
apply
where
the
multiple
counts
are
alternative
theories
of
proving
what
is
the
same
offense,
as
they
were
in
this
case.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
well,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at.
the
court
said
what's
not
important
is
lesser
or
greater,
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
it
is
vital
that
it
is
a
distinct
and
different
offense.
and
you
simply
don't
have
that
here,
because
on...
under
state
law,
under
the
common
law,
and
under
the
law
of
most
american
jurisdictions,
felony
murder
and
murder
are
not
separate
offenses;
they
are
part
of
a
unified
offense,
and
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
schad
case.
and
the
fourth
point
is
that
to
apply
double
jeopardy
or
collateral
estoppel
in
the
manner
that
petitioner
suggests
would
be
to
create
a
new
rule
and
to
apply
it
retroactively
in
a
habeas
corpus
case,
which
this
court
has
held
time
and
again
is
not
appropriate.
before
i
amplify
on
those
points,
however,
i
do
want
to
correct
what
i
believe
may
have
been
a
misimpression
about
indiana
practice
with
respect
to
jury
instructions,
because
the
practice
has
changed
over
time.
at
the
time
of
this
trial
it
was
inappropriate
under
indiana
law...
and
there
were
several
indiana
supreme
court
cases
indicating
that
instructions
were
not
to
go
to
the
jury
room.
over
time
that
practice
evolved.
the
indiana
supreme
court
began
saying,
well,
it's
okay
to
send
them
to
the
jury
room,
or
at
least
it's
not
error.
and
the
current
state
of
the
law
is
that
it's
the
better
practice
to
send
them
to
the
jury
room.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
1981.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
there
were
three
sheets
of
paper.
as
we've
noted
in
our
brief...
and
there
were...
three
of
the
forms
were
on
one
sheet,
three
were
on
another,
and
four
were
on
another
sheet.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
and...
but
they
were
not
all
on
one
form,
and
they
were
not
on
separate
sheets
for
each
one.
there
were
3
sheets
of
paper
that
contained
the
total
of
the
10
forms.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
well,
because,
as
the
court
recognized
in
green,
the
vital
thing
is
that
you
have
a
distinct
and
different
offense
involved,
and
felony
murder
and
murder
simply
are
not.
in
addition,
on
this
record
it
is
a
requisite
for
the
application
of
price
and
green
that
the
jury
has
a
full
opportunity
to
convict,
and
in
this
context
opportunity
to
convict
has
to
mean
that
the
jury
had
an
opportunity
to
convict
on
all
of
the
counts.
because,
as
i
believe
in
one
of
the
answers
to
one
of
the
questions
earlier,
had
they
convicted
on
the...
on
count
i
but
been
silent
on
counts
ii
and
iii,
then
we
would
be
here
arguing
over
whether
they
had
acquitted
him
of
the
felony.
and
the
only
case
that
we've
been
able
to
locate
that
addresses
this
specific
issue
is
a
case
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
people
v.
jackson,
where
the
jury
in
that
case
was
told...
the
charges
were
premeditated
murder
and
felony
murder.
the
jury
was
told
you
only
are
supposed
to
return
one
verdict.
and
in
analyzing...
and,
of
course,
they
followed
that.
they
returned
one
verdict.
they
were
silent
on
the
other
count.
the
conviction
was
reversed
for
other
grounds,
and
the
state
went
back
and
tried
the
case
again
on
both
counts.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
that
simply
green
and
price
aren't
implicated
under
those
circumstances...
well,
that
green
wasn't
implicated,
price
had
not
been
decided
yet.
and
this
court
implicitly
approved
that
analysis,
in
fact,
in
price
when
it
specifically
cited
people
v.
jackson
in
the
context
of
discussing
opportunity
to
convict.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that's
correct.
and
that
is
another
reason
that
the
cases
are
distinguishable.
i
believe
they're
distinguishable
for
at
least
three
different
reasons.
one,
simply
the
nature
of
the
offenses.
the
court
has
said
it's
important
you
have
a
distinct
and
different
offense.
and,
if
you
look
at
some
hypotheticals,
you
can
see
why
it's
that
factor,
rather
than
greater
and
lesser
offenses,
that
is...
that
is
important.
because
if
a
defendant
were,
say,
charged
with
robbery
and
rape,
which...
neither
of
which
are
lesser
or
included,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
on
one
of
them.
assuming
that
the
court
discharged
the
jury
without
declaring
a
mistrial
because
they
had
hung,
rather
than
telling
them
to
continue
to
deliberate,
then
there
would
be
a
problem
with
trying
that
second
charge
in
a
subsequent
prosecution,
but
that
simply
is
not
this
case.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
no.
each
of
the...
each
of
the
offenses...
the
offense
alleged
in
each
of
the
counts
was
murder
under
indiana
law,
and
the
murder
occurred
only
once.
she
died
at
one
time.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
schad
v.
arizona,
murder
and
felony
murder
simply...
they
were
not
separate
offenses
at
common
law.
they
are
not
separate
offenses
under
the
laws
of
most
american
jurisdictions
and,
indeed,
the
indiana
supreme
court's
precedents
make
clear
that
they
are
not
separate
offenses
under
indiana
law.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
well,
had
they...
had
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
on
more
than
one
of
the
counts,
the
trial
court
would
have
been
required
to
not
enter
conviction...
to
enter
conviction
on
only
one.
it
is
inappropriate--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
consistent
with
indiana
law,
in
the
sense
that
if
they
did
so,
the
court
was
required
to
take
corrective
action.
so
in
that
sense,
i'm
not
sure
it
is
consistent
with
indiana
law.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
the
court...
yes,
the
court
would
have
been
able
to
do
that.
i
think
one--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--um--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--there
are
no
specific
standards
for
guidance.
probably
the
most
serious
of
the...
of
the
verdicts,
which
in
this
case--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--ii
and
iii
were
both
capital
charges.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
and,
in
fact,
under
the
instructions
in
this
case,
count
ii,
i
believe,
would
have
been
the
most
serious,
the
one,
in
fact,
that
the
jury
did
return
a
verdict
of
conviction
on.
it's
important
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
claim
here,
and
i
think
when
that
is
done
it
becomes
clear
that
it
is
not
a
pure
double
jeopardy
claim,
but
rather
it
is
a
collateral
estoppel
claim
in
the
mode
of
ashe
v.
swenson
and
that
line
of
cases.
because
this
court's
cases
consistently
teach
that
what
double
jeopardy
precludes
is
a
subsequent
prosecution
for
an
entire
offense.
it
simply
doesn't
speak
to
preclusion
of
particular
elements,
particular
factual
elements.
if
it
did,
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
for
the
court
to
decide
ashe
v.
swenson,
if
double
jeopardy,
pure
double
jeopardy
dealt
with
issue
preclusion.
in
this
sense,
a
pure
double
jeopardy
claim
in
criminal
law
is
analogous
to
a
claim
preclusion
claim
in
the
civil
law,
just
as...
and
collateral
estoppel
in
criminal
law,
of
course,
is
analogous
to
collateral
estoppel
in
civil
law.
in
one
instance,
the
whole
claim
is
precluded,
whether
that
is
a
civil
or
criminal
claim,
cause
of
action
as
it
were,
and
in
the
other
instance
particular
elements
are
precluded.
that
is
important
for
this
case
for
a
number
of
reasons,
because
if
the
record
in
this
case
shows
anything,
it
shows
that
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
establish
a
jury
determination
on
the
issue
of
intent
in
his
favor.
the
court's
cases
are
very
clear
that
this
burdener...
burden
rests
on
one
claiming
criminal
collateral
estoppel.
all
the
way
from
ashe
v.
swenson,
which
adopted
collateral
estoppel,
to
dowling
v.
united
states,
one
of
the
court's
more
recent
cases
on
the
issue,
the
court
has
made
plain
that
the
defendant
must
show
that
there
is
no
other
possible
explanation
for
the
verdict.
i
believe...
that
is
a
paraphrase,
if
you
will,
of
dowling.
here,
of
course,
there
are
a
number
of
possible
other
explanations.
but
in
analyzing
whether
there
was
an
actual
determination
in
his
favor,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
two
things.
first,
what
did
the
state
courts
find
on
the
issue?
and
second,
are
those
findings
fairly
supported
by
the
record?
the
indiana
supreme
court's
finding
is
clear,
that
the
jury
simply
chose
not
to
consider
count
i..
that
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
140.
and
that's
a
finding
that's
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
correctness
under
28
u.s.c.
section
2254(d),
as
long
as
it's
fairly
supported
by
the
record.
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
the
record
fairly
supports
the
indiana
supreme
court's
conclusion.
petitioner's
argument
is
that
the
jury
acquitted
him
on
the
issue
of
intent.
they
found
intent
was
lacking.
well,
what
does
the
record
show
with
respect
to
that?
first,
we
have
the
facts
of
the
crime.
by
his
own
admission,
petitioner
repeated
raped
the
victim
and
then
killed
her
for
the
express
purpose
of
preventing
her
from
reporting
the
rapes.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that's...
exactly.
and
that
is
another
reason
that
i
think
it's
clear
on
this
record
that
the
jury
didn't
determine
any
issues
in
the
defendant's
favor.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
certainly,
it
would
have
obviated
a
great
deal
of
the
confusion.
it
is
in
no
sense
constitutionally
required.
i
think
that's
clear
from
this
court's--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--not
collateral
estoppel
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
because,
as
this
court
noted
in
ohio
v.
johnson,
unless
you
have
successive
prosecutions,
which
is
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
really
aimed
at,
neither
pure
double
jeopardy
nor
collateral
estoppel
growing
out
of
double
jeopardy
applies,
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
you
simply
cannot
create
a
bar
between
the
separate--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--well,
you
need
to
bear
in
mind
in
ashe
v.
swenson
the
fact
situation.
the
defendant
there
had
been
accused
of
robbing,
i
believe,
four
people.
the
state
first
had
one
prosecution
with
respect
to
one
of
the
victims,
and
then
on
a
second
indictment
had
a
whole
other
prosecution
on
another
of
the
victims.
and
so
ashe
v.
swenson
simply
doesn't
govern
this
case
where
you've
got
separate
stages
of
a
single
trial.
and,
indeed,
nothing
in
the
court's
collateral
estoppel
jurisprudence
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
suggests
that
you
can
create
an
estoppel
in
the
middle
of
a
proceeding,
and
ohio
v.
johnson
says
that
you
cannot.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
i--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--assuming
your
proceedings
are
governed
by
the
same
burden
of
proof,
i
believe
there
certainly
would
be...
might
be
something
in
the
constitution
that
would
prevent
that.
i
think
the
most--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--if
i
may
explain,
i
believe
that
a
doctrine
that
the
court
could
develop
in
an
appropriate
case,
a
case
on
direct
review
where
it
wouldn't
be
creating
a
new
rule,
would
be
in
the
nature
of
issue
preclusion,
and
that
it
should
be
grounded
just
as
the
cases,
the
mixed
law
and
equity
cases
are
grounded
on
the
appropriate
right
to
a
jury
trial
provision,
rather
than
on
the
notion...
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
which
is
simply
not
aimed
at
anything
but
successive
prosecutions.
so
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
wouldn't
be
something
that
would
require
some
form
of
issue
preclusion.
it's
not
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that...
that
is
the
point,
your
honor.
but
also
to
create--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--as
i
understood
the
hypothetical,
i
do
think
there
would...
there
would
be
problems
with
having
that
issue
relitigated.
i
don't
think
that
rule
should
be
created
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
rule
should
be
grounded
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
it
would
be
more
appropriately
grounded
on
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial--
mr.
arend
j.
abel
--which
was
not
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that's
correct.
and
that...
that
is
our
main
argument
in
this
case.
but
it
also...
to
apply
a...
the
form
of
collateral
estoppel
that
i
believe
would
need
to
apply
in
the
hypothetical,
would
create
new
law
and
would
address
issues
not
raised
in
the
petition
in
this
case.
in
terms
of
the
implied
acquittal
rule
of
price
v.
georgia
and
green
v.
united
states,
first
i
think
it's
clear
an
implied
acquittal
is
not
enough
for
collateral
estoppel;
you
need
an
actual
finding.
but
even
if
the
law
were
to
the
contrary,
that
rule
simply
doesn't
apply,
as
this
court
recognized
in
cichos
v.
indiana
where
your
separate
counts
are
multiple
theories
of
the
same
offense.
and
that's
precisely
what
felony
murder
and
murder
are
under
indiana
law
and
under
the
common
law,
and
in
a
manner
that's
entirely
constitutional,
as
this
court
recognized
in
schad
v.
arizona.
also,
in
this
case
there
would
not
be
an
opportunity
to
convict
under
price
and
green
because
the
jury
was
told
by
both
defense
counsel
and
by
the
prosecutor
that
its
task
was
to
pick
from
among
the
three
verdicts.
and
i
think
the
thrust
of
the
prosecutor's
remarks...
and
i
think
this
is
clear
from
the
transcript,
which
is
included
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
so
you
can
see
the
whole
context.
and
why
this
point
came
up
in
rebuttal
was
the
defendant
had,
indeed,
presented
this
defense
to
one
of
the
felony
murder
counts,
and
the
prosecutor
said
to
the
jury
it
doesn't
matter
because
you
can
only
return
one
verdict
anyway.
he
said,
give
the
defense
counsel
his
argument,
be
that
as
it
may,
you're
only
allowed
to
return
one
verdict.
and
under
those
circumstances,
there's
simply
not
the
full
opportunity
to
convict
required
for
the
implied
acquittal
doctrine
in
price
and
green.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
i
believe
the
criterion
is
how
state
law
defines
the
offense,
so
long
as
it
does
so
in
a
manner
consistent
with
due
process
under
schad.
i
think
the
states
are
free
to
define
certainly
murder
and
felony
murder
as
a
single
offense.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
um.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
that's
correct.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
certainly
if
that
were
the
test
to
be
applied,
this
case
would
meet
it.
i
simply
haven't
thought
through
all
the
potential
hypotheticals
and
statutes
dealing
with
aggravated
robberies
and
so
forth,
so
i'm
not
sure
of
the
test.
i
think...
but
i
believe
it
should
be
the
test
that
the
court
applied
in
schad;
that
the
state
can
do
it,
constrained
by
the
limits
in
schad.
and,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
i
believe
it's
not
really
a
question
of
either
law.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
historical
fact.
it's
subject
to
the
presumption
of
correctness
under
teague,
because
the
question
is,
sort
of,
what
did
the
jury
do
here.
and,
as
the
indiana
supreme
court
found,
they
simply
didn't
reach
that
count.
mr.
arend
j.
abel
i
still
believe
that
it
would
be
a
factual
question,
depending
on
what
else
might
be
in
the
record
that
would
determine
a
resolution
of
that
factual
question.
but
i
think,
fundamentally,
it's
a
question
what
did
the
jury
do?
and
there's
always
at
least
some
possibility
that
the
jury
would
not
have
followed
such
an
instruction,
although
ordinarily
courts
presume
that
they
do.
so
that's
probably
the
basis
the
state
courts
would
start
from
in
making
that
finding.
