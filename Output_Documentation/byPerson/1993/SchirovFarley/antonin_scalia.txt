justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
foster,
could...
can
i
ask
this
question?
suppose
you
have
a
defendant
who
is
tried
and
convicted
and
sentenced
for
rape.
he
is
then
subsequently
prosecuted
and
convicted
for
murder
in
connection
with
the
same
episode.
would,
in
your
view,
a
showing
at
the
sentencing
phase
of
that
murder
proceeding
that
the
murder
occurred
in
the
course
of
a
rape,
would
that
be
invalid,
to
use
the
rape
as
an
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
convicted
of
rape.
he's
later
convicted
of
murder
in
the
course
of
the
rape.
would
showing
that
the
rape
was
an
aggravating
circumstance
of
the
murder
be
precluded?
would
he
be
placed
in
double
jeopardy
if
the
prosecution
tries
to
come
in
and
say
this
murder
should
be
punished
by
death
because
there
is
the
aggravating
circumstance
of
rape,
he
having
been
convicted
of
rape
already
in
the
first
trial?
it's
your
position,
is
it
not,
that
that's
double
jeopardy?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
isn't
a
felony
murder.
suppose
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
it's
intentional
murder,
but
what
is
shown
at
the
sentencing
phase
is
that
rape
was
part
of
the...
of
the
event.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he's
been
treated...
he's
been
tried
for
the
rape.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
rape
as
an
aggravator.
you
would
have
no
problem,
although
rape
has
already
been...
he's
been
exposed
to
jeopardy
for
that,
that
could
still
be
brought
in
at
the
sentencing
phase.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
no
double
jeopardy
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right.
it's
okay
to
be
convicted
twice
but
not
to
be
acquitted
and
then
convicted?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
produce
a
lot
of
hung
juries.
you're
saying
every
jury
has
to
be...
if
the
defense
counsel
requests
it,
has
to
be
required
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
all
of
the
counts.
they
can't
say,
hey,
one
is
good
enough;
you
know,
they'll
go
up
for
30
years
on
this
one.
they
don't
have
to
consider
the
rest.
they're
going
to
have
to
consider
each
one
and
come
in
with
a
verdict
of
guilty
or
innocent
on
each
one.
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
normally
that
instruction,
isn't
it?
you're
normally
instructed
to
return
a
verdict
on
every
count.
you
don't
say
just
do
one
count
and
go
home
for
the
evening.
[laughter]
this
last
trial
in
los
angeles,
they
spent
about
a
week
extra
getting
the
extra
counts
decided.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
we'll
have
to
make
up
something
else,
won't
we.
i
mean,
you...
you
acknowledged
earlier
that...
very
subtly
that
there
might
be
some
other
constitutional
doctrine
that
prevents
it,
but
it's
not
collateral
estoppel
or
double
jeopardy.
surely
we
can't
have
proceedings
in
which
a
jury
first
finds
that
fact
x
doesn't
exist
and
then
in
the
same
proceeding,
in
order
to
determine
the
penalty,
it
is
found
that
fact
x
does
exist.
and,
you
know,
you're
not
troubled
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
we
don't
call
it
collateral
estoppel,
let's
call
it
something
else,
but
surely
things
like
that
should
not
happen,
should
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
clarify
for
me
what
you
mean
by...
you
know,
when
there
are
just
different
theories
of
the
same
offense,
what
is
the
criterion
for
that,
whether
separate
sentences
could
be
imposed
for
each
of
the
convictions?
i
assume
you've...
if
one
type
of
murder
had
a
40-year
sentence,
another
a
30-year,
and
another
a
20-year,
whether
you
could
convict
of
all
three
and
string
the
sentences
together,
is
that
the
criterion?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
but,
i
mean,
isn't
the
easier
way
to
tell
whether
it's
a
single
offense
or
multiple
offense
is
whether
you
can
get
two
punishments
for
this...
for
the
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
here
you
could
only
be
punished
for
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
type
or
the
other
of
murder.
and
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
get
three
separate
punishments
for
three
separate
kinds
of
murder,
because
there
was
only
one
murder.
is
that
the
point?
