not
findings.
a
specific
verdict.
in
this
case,
the
defense
counsel
should
have
said,
your
honor,
please
give
the
jury
forms
that
will...
will
give
them
an
opportunity
to
make
specific
findings
of
not
guilty
in
relation
to
each
of
the
three
specific
homicide
charges
here.
because
if
the...
if
the
jury
had
come
back
with
a
specific
finding
of
not
guilty
and
returned
a
form
to
the...
to
the
intentional
killing
you'd
have
a
very
different
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
it
make
sense
for
us
to
require
that,
simply
to
avoid
this
attempt
at
reconstruction
afterwards,
which
is
never
very
satisfactory?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we've
got...
we've
got
a
federal
issue
here.
i
mean,
it's
up
to
us
to
decide
what
is
a
sufficient
predicate
for
collateral
estoppel
under
ashe
and
swenson.
why
should...
why
isn't
it
appropriate
for
us
to
impose
that
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we...
if
we,
in
fact,
find
that
we
cannot
draw
a
sufficiently
sound
inference
to
raise
an
estoppel,
would
you...
would
you
concede
that
the
suggestion...
that
the
imposition
of
such
a
bright
line
rule
would,
in
fact,
be
appropriate?
your
client
would
not
suffer
and
we
wouldn't
be
in
quite
such
a
confusing
situation
in
the
future.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why...
why
would
it,
if
the
jury
was
not
instructed
to
do
it?
why
shouldn't
juries
act
the
way
most
of
us
would
act?
and
that
is
if
they,
in
fact,
found
the
felony
murder,
which
is...
which
does
not
involve
any
subtle
weighing
of
evidence
about
state
of
mind,
and
they
have
no
doubt
about
the...
the
predicate
for
that
conviction.
why,
unless
they
are
otherwise
instructed,
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
went
on
and,
in
fact,
took
up
the
rather
more
difficult
issue?
isn't
the
inference
just
the
opposite?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
was
not
raised
in
this
case,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
your
argument
would
be
even
if
it
was
decided
and
even
if
there
was
no
teague
problem,
that
we
still
couldn't
find
in
their
favor
in
this
case?
