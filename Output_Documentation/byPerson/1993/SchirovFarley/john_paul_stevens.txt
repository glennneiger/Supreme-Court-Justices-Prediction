justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
a...
are
you
through?
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
may
i
ask
a
question
about
instruction
number...
final
instruction
21,
which
says...
ends
saying
the
foreman
will
preside
over
deliberations
and
must
sign
and
date
the
verdict,
parenthesis
s,
close
parenthesis,
to
which
you
all
agree.
so,
in
a
written
statement,
that
seems
to
contemplate
plural
verdicts.
i'm
curious
to
know
if
the
transcript
of
the...
in
the...
of
the
proceedings
themselves
indicate
what
the
judge
said
when
he
read
that
instruction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
don't
know
how
he
conveyed
the
parenthesis,
s,
close
parenthesis
to
the
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
written
instructions
go
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
the
written
instructions
went,
then
the
judge,
in
effect,
said
you
can
return
more
than
one
verdict.
but
if
he
read
verdict,
that
would
be
a
different
reading.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
answer
that
in
indiana
to
prove
the
aggravating
circumstance
to
make
death-eligible,
that
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
so
that
there's
a
difference
and
justice
ginsburg's
problem
would
not
arise
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
a
different
standard
in
the
sentencing
guidelines.
you
have
the
same
standard
in
indiana.
let
me
ask
a
question
about
the
collateral
estoppel
aspect
of
your
argument.
would
it
make
sense
for
us
to
adopt
a
kind
of
bright
line
rule
to
the
effect
that
in
a
situation
exemplified
by
this
one,
we
will...
we
will
not,
for
federal
constitutional
purposes,
infer
any
fact
finding
and
hence
raise
any
estoppel
unless
the
defense
counsel
has,
in
fact,
asked
for
specific
verdicts
on
each
of
the
specific
counts,
or
at
least
on
the
specific
count
or
indictment
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
basis
for
the
estoppel,
so
as
to
avoid
all
of
this
tea-leaf
reading
after
the
fact?
why
wouldn't
it
make
sense
to
ask
for
a
bright
line
rule
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
before
you
go
on
to
your
other
three,
if
the
first
one,
there
had
been
an
explicit
finding
by
the
jury
of
not
guilty
on
the
intentional
murder
count,
would
you
still
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
your
second?
you
skipped
to
the
third.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say
about
footnote
14
that
she
relies
so
heavily
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
abel,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you.
why
do
you
say
that
these
three
offenses
are
not
separate?
it
seems
to
me
they
were
separate
in
point
in
time,
among
other
things.
one...
the
deviate
one
is
different
from
the
rape,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
the
jury,
consistently
with
indiana
law,
could
have
returned
a
guilty
verdict
on
one,
two,
or
three
of
the
counts?
it
would
have
been
consistent
with
indiana
law
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
just
asking
about
the
jury.
consistently
with
indiana
law,
the
jury
could
have
returned
all
three
verdicts,
two
verdicts,
or
one
verdict?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it
would
have
happened,
he
would
have
been
able
to
choose
among
three
different
guilty
verdicts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
one
other
question,
if
i
may?
at
the
heart
of
this
case,
of
course,
is
how
we
interpret
the
jury's
silence
on
that
one
instruction.
is
it...
what
is
your
view
on
whether
that's
a
question
of
state
law
or
federal
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
it
were
perfectly
clear.
say
the
instructions
were
more
the
way
your
opponent
would
like
them,
where
the
judge
said
in
so
many
words,
return
verdicts
on
all
the
counts
that
you
can
make
up
your
mind
on,
or
something
like
that,
and
clearly
said
you
have
a
duty
to
decide
the
whole
case,
and
then
they
failed
and
they
left
a
silent
verdict
as
to
one
of
the
three
counts.
would
the
determination
of
whether
that's
equivalent
to
an
acquittal
or
not,
you
think,
be
a
matter
of
federal
law
or
state
law,
under
those
facts?
