we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
92-7549,
thomas
schiro
v.
robert
farley.
ms.
foster,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
refer
to
it
as
the
guilt
trial
and
the
penalty.
it's
more
generally
spoken
of
as
the
guilt
phase
and
the
penalty
phase.
is
there
any
difference,
for
our
purposes,
between
those
two
terms?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
presumably
mens
rea
in
connection
with
that
felony,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
try
this
case,
ms.
foster?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're...
you're
judging
from
the
transcript,
i
take
it.
you
weren't
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
does
that
mean
that
he
was
acquitted
on
those
charges?
granted,
the
jury
returned
no
verdict
on
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
the
court
said
in
green?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
foster.
i
think
you
did
very
well
on
the
4
minutes
that
the
court
allowed
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
abel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
this
case
tried,
mr.
abel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
price
and
green,
too,
mr.
abel,
it
was
two
successive
proceedings
in
each
case,
wasn't
it?
one
case
had
gone
to
judgment
and
then
there
was
a
second
separate
proceeding
brought.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
abel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
92-7549,
schiro
against
farley
will
be
announced
justice
o'connor.
