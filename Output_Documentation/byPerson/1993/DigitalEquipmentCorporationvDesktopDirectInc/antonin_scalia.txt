justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose,
mr.
roberts,
that
your
right
not
to
be
sued
was
a
right
not
to
be
sued
on
the
underlying
cause
of
action--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
a
right
not
to
be
sued
for
rescission
of
what
is
claimed
to
be
an
invalid
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
such
an
agreement
not
to
sue
you
for
fraud
or
for
any
other
invalidity
of
an
agreement
is
probably
void
as
contrary
to
public
policy,
i
would
think,
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
just
told
us
that
common
facts
don't
make
the
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
right
not
to
be
sued
because
of
a
statute
of
limitations
bar?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
once
the
delay
has
occurred,
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
sued,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
once
your
agreement
has
been
signed
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
sued.
i
mean,
a
right
not
to
be
sued
is
a
right
not
to
be
sued
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
it
does
so
to
determine
whether
it's
important
enough,
and
you
deny
that
that's
the
element.
what
is
the
element,
if
that's
not
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
you
argue
that
there
is
no
textual
basis
for
imposing
an
importance
test.
what
textual
basis
is
there
for
the
cohn
exception
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
interpretation
of
the
word
final
to
mean
not
everything
that's
final--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
consider
that
a
textual
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
does
the
effective
reviewability
have
to
do
with
finality?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
that
something
that
is
effectively
reviewable
cannot
be
final?
my
goodness,
we
review
final
orders
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
totally
different
meaning
of
finally.
you
mean,
we
will
finally
lose
our--
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
there
are
standards
to
guide
what
is
a
complete
right
to
avoid
trial
and
what
is
not
a
complete
right
to
avoid
trial,
so
that
a
statute
of
limitations
isn't,
but
this
is.
you
consider
there
are
standards
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
quite
fictional,
and
that
you
are
really
discussing
what
is
the
crucial
issue
when
you
discuss
importance,
rather
than
deal
with
philosophical
questions
of
what
is
a
complete
right
to
avoid
suit
and
what
isn't
a
complete
right
to
avoid
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
good
argument
if
you
think
that
cohen
is
to
be
found
within
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
i
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
there
are
some
dispositions,
such
as
whether
the
president
has
particular
powers,
which
we
would
find
to
be
present
in
the
constitution
absent
legislation,
but
which
we
would
find
that
legislation
can
nonetheless
change,
and
it's
conceivable
that
immunity
is
one
of
those
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
that
it
comes
from
the
constitution
is
only
necessarily
to
say
that
absent
a
statute
to
the
contrary,
we
think
that
the
disposition,
given
the
constitution,
is
such-and-such--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
doesn't
necessarily
say
you
couldn't
change
it
by
a
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
took
the
language,
too
important
to
be
completely
denied
review,
to
be
a
reference
to
one
of
the
cohen
conditions.
that
is
to
say,
is
it
effectively...
you
don't
even
debate
about
the
rest
of
it
unless
you've
determined
that
it's
effectively
nonreviewable,
unless
you
review
it
now.
that's
one
of
the
requirements--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay,
but
even
given
that,
it's
not
enough.
it
has
to
be
too
important
to
be
denied
review
altogether.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
some
things,
impliedly,
that
are
not
so
important
that
they
can't
be
denied
review
altogether.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
on
and
get
too
far
away
from
your
last
point...
that
is,
the
characterization--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
this
agreement,
if
we
decide
for
you
on
the
basis
of
that
argument,
all
we
really
will
have
achieved
is
that
all
settlement
agreements
in
the
future
will
say,
the
purpose
of
this
settlement
agreement
is
to
ensure
that
we
don't
have
to
be
sued.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
certainly
write
it
that
way,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
