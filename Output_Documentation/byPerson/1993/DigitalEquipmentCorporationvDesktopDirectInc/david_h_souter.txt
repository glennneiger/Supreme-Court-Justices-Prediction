justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
roberts,
may
i
ask
you
just
a
narrow
question?
is
wilfulness
an
element
both
of
the
fraud
claimed
as
a
basis
for
the
rescission
as
well
as
the
damages
claimed
in
the
action
on
the
merits?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
issue,
so
far
as
the
second
element
under
cohen
is
concerned?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
your...
i
don't
want
to
be
too
picky,
but
i
think
you're
saying,
yes,
on
the
face
of
it
there
is
not
a
complete
distinction
between
the
issue
upon
which
the
rescission
turns
and
the
underlying
cause
of
action,
but
you
are
now
saying
that
this
court
really
has
not
insisted
on
that
degree
of
separability,
is
that
fair
to
say?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
a
common
element
is
not
sufficient
to
defeat
separability.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it's
a
complete
answer
to
justice
scalia
to
say
that
the
courts
have
repeatedly
found
that
the
cohen
exception
is
appropriate,
the
courts
have
just
as
repeatedly
said
that
importance
is
to
be
considered,
so
why
don't
we
get
to
the
merits
of
importance.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
argument
really
isn't
a
stare
decisis
argument,
then,
on
that,
in
response
to
justice
scalia.
you're
not
saying
stare
decisis
to
preserve
cohen,
but
no
stare
decisis
to
preserve
importance.
justice
david
h.
souter
we've
never
had
a
trivial
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
interrupt
you
here
for
a
second?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
with
mr.
roberts
that
wilfulness
is
a
common
element
both
of
the
fraud
claim
on
which
the
rescission
is
based
as
well
as
the
cause
of
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
second
of
the
two
cases
i
have
to
announce
is
digital
equipment
versus
desktop
direct,
no.
93-405.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit.
in
1991,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
digital
equipment
corporation,
began
to
market
a
service
it
called
desktop
direct
from
digital.
the
respondent,
desktop
direct,
which
is
like
petitioners
in
the
computer
business
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court
claiming
that
digital
was
infringing
its
trade
name.
the
parties
then
reached
a
confidential
settlement
agreement
and,
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
desktop
dismissed
its
suit.
several
months
later,
desktop
asked
the
district
court
to
vacate
its
dismissal
order
and
rescind
the
agreement.
desktop
contended
that
digital
had
misrepresented
material
facts
in
the
course
of
settlement
negotiations.
the
court
granted
desktop's
motion
and
when
digital
sought
an
immediate
appeal
under
28
u.s.
code
1291,
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
this
case
requires
us
to
decide
whether
an
order
denying
effect
to
a
privately
negotiated
settlement
agreement
qualified
such
an
immediately
appealable
collateral
order
as
to
allow
appeal
as
requested
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
that
it
does
not.
in
arguing
that
section
1291
confers
appellate
jurisdiction,
digital
relies
on
cases
holding
a
party
entitled
to
immediate
appeal
of
the
decision
denying
certain
claimed
rights
not
to
stand
trial.
we
have
previously
held,
for
example,
that
a
criminal
defendant
may
take
an
immediate
appeal
from
a
district
court
order
denying
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
double
jeopardy
grounds,
and
that
a
government
official
claiming
immunity
from
suit
also
may
appeal
an
address
decision
on
that
point.
our
reasoning
in
each
instance
was
similar.
the
right
not
to
stand
trial
could
not
be
vindicated
if
the
party
claiming
it
was
forced
to
endure
a
full
trial
before
taking
an
appeal.
digital
claims
that
this
case
is
indistinguishable
and
that
its
settlement
agreement
with
desktop
gave
it
a
freedom
from
suit
no
different
from
and
no
less
than
need
of
prompt
vindication
then
those
of
criminal
and
governmental
defendants.
but,
we
detect
two
telling
differences:
first,
even
if
desktop
has
given
digital
the
sort
of
immunity
claimed,
a
point
which
desktop
by
no
means
concedes,
this
sort
of
privately
granted
right
cannot
displace
the
strong
statutory
presumption
against
piecemeal
appeals
in
the
same
manner
as
immunity
is
rooted
in
the
constitution
or
statute
have
been
held
to
do.
secondly,
such
private
rights
can
be
vindicated
using
other
less
disruptive
means
such
as
state
court
contract
actions
to
an
extent
that
public
law
immunities
may
not.
finally,
claims
of
freedom
from
trial
by
private
agreement
are
not
significantly
distinguishable
from
many
others
such
as
assertions
that
an
appellant's
action
is
barred
by
res
judicata
or
limitation
statute
which
have
been
held
not
to
be
appealable
immediately.
to
find
jurisdiction
only
over
appeals
like
digital's
would
thus
be
arbitrary,
but
to
allow
these
other
comparable
sorts
to
be
entertained
routinely
would
badly
erode
the
safeguard
against
piecemeal
litigation.
our
opinion
in
this
case
is
unanimous.
