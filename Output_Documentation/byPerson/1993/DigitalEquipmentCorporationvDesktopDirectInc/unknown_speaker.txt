there
is
an
important
distinction,
justice
stevens,
in
answer
to
your
question
about
breach
of
contract,
between
constitutional
rights
and
statutory
rights
on
the
one
hand
not
to
go
to
trial,
and
those
that
derive
from
breach
of
contract.
typically,
in
order
to
vindicate
statutorily
created
or
constitutionally
created
rights
not
to
go
to
trial,
the
only
way
that
can
be
done
is
to
stop
the
trial,
whereas
in
the
case
of
a
private
contract,
there
is
an
additional
remedy,
and
it's
the
same
remedy
that
is
available
in
any
contract
case,
and
that
is
damages
for
breach
of
contract
which
can
be
reviewed
after
the
case
finally
goes
to
final
judgment,
as
1291
says
that
it
should.
we
fully
recognize
that,
and
i
expect
fully
to
hear
those
words
played
back
to
me
at
a
later
point
in
time
in
a
utah
court...
in
the
utah
district
court,
but
that's
our
position
on
this
point
of
law.
mr.
lee,
would
you
explain
your
position
on
the
first
two
cohen
standards?
i
take
it
that
you
agree
with
mr.
roberts
that
those
two
standards
are
met,
and
i
was...
i
didn't
understand
why
you
agreed--
