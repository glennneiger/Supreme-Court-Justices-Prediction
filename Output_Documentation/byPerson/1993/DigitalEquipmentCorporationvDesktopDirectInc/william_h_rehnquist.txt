we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-405,
digital
equipment
corporation
v.
desktop
direct,
inc.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
a
certain
amount
of
word
play
there,
though,
you
know,
and
in
the
court's
opinions
it
isn't
all
that
easy
to
distinguish
the
various
rights,
some
of
which
have
gone
one
way
and
some
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
issue
involved
in
cohen,
the
cost
bond,
might
well
not
qualify
as
important,
if
that
were
a
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
lee,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
going
to
say
it's
an
exception,
you're
saying,
then,
that
final
judgment
and
final
decision
are
identical
terms.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
cohen?
cohen
certainly
didn't
say
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lee,
do
you
think
that
congress
couldn't
change
the
result
on
the
merits
in
mitchell?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
it's
not
a
constitutional
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
by
definition,
if
congress
can
change
it,
the
rule
is
not
constitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
can't,
but
you
said
a
moment
ago
congress
could
change
the
result
in
mitchell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
congress
could
not
change
qualified
immunity
of
the
attorney
general.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
test
of
the
validity
of
a
concurrence,
that
no
member
of
the
majority
objects
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
would
have...
you
would
say,
i
take
it,
if
the
language
is
too
important
to
be
denied
review
altogether,
if
that's
the
language
from
cohen,
and
you
say
it
is
ultimately
capable
of
being
reviewed,
you
could
concede
the
importance
of
this
and
still
say
that
it's
not
being
denied
review
altogether.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
read
these
recent
opinions,
it
seems
to
me
you
can
go
further
than
that
and
say
that
the
collateral
order
doctrine
is
a
very,
very
narrow
one,
and
we
will
be
very
loth
to
extend
it
to
anything
it
doesn't
already
cover.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
just
laughing
at
your
statement,
the
importance
of
importance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
importance
of
being
important.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
