mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
starting
point
for
analysis
is,
of
course,
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
in
this
case
it
is
plain.
the
courts
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
of
appeals
from
all
final
decisions
of
the
district
courts.
because
the
collateral
order
rule
is
an
exception,
and
it
is,
the
court
has
said
that
many
times,
to
this
clear
congressional
directive
which
on
its
face
recognizes
no
exceptions,
this
court
has
very
carefully
and
consistently
clarified
that
as
an
exception
it
is
to
be
narrowly
construed,
and
it
applies
only
to
a
small
class
of
cases.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
the
court
has
so
said
on
a
number
of
occasions,
including
the
principal
case
that
lays
down
the
test,
or
at
least
it
so
implies...
coopers
&
lybrand
v.
livesay.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
cohen
didn't,
but
there
was
an
earlier
case,
cobbledick,
that
said...
cohen
did
not.
i
think
the
best
statement
that
decision
equals
judgment
is
found
in
the
coopers
&
lybrand
case.
for
three
separate
reasons,
any
one
of
which
is
independently
sufficient
in
the
sense
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
any
one
of
the
three
then
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
should
be
affirmed,
this
case
does
not
fall
within
that
small
class,
and
the
three
reasons
are,
first
of
all,
it
does
not
satisfy
the
midland
asphalt
requirement,
which
requires
a
distinction
for
purpose
of
determining
the
right
to
avoid
trial
between
public
rights
on
the
one
hand
and
private
on
the
other.
second,
it
fails
the
importance
test,
and
third,
it
is
effectively
reviewable
on
appeal.
two
preliminary
observations
with
regard
to
these
three
points.
the
first
is
that
they
are
separate
in
the
sense
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
any
one
of
the
three,
then
we
win
the
case,
but
there
are
interrelationships
and
overlaps
among
the
three.
with
regard
to
the
midland
asphalt
requirement,
the
petitioner's
whole
case
rests
on
its
contention
that
it
has
been
deprived
of
a
right
not
to
go
to
trial,
but
there
has
been
no
such
deprivation,
as
that
right
has
been
defined
by
this
court.
midland
asphalt
states
unequivocally
that
a
right
not
to
be
tried
in
the
sense
relevant
to
cohen
rests
upon
an
explicit
statutory
or
constitutional
guarantee
that
trial
will
not
occur.
the
petitioner's
claim
here
finds
its
source
neither
in
the
constitution
nor
in
statutory
law,
so
that
faced
with
this
dilemma,
the
petitioner
takes
the
only
position
that
it
possibly
can
take,
which
is
that
the
court
didn't
know
what
to
say,
or
the
court
made
a
mistake
in
midland
asphalt,
and
they
rely
on
mitchell
v.
forsyth,
contending
that
there
was
no
explicit
constitutional
or
statutory
guarantee
in
mitchell
v.
forsyth.
in
our
view,
that
contention
is
180
degrees
wrong.
the
court
found
that
the
right
at
issue
in
mitchell,
which
was
the
qualified
immunity
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
was
based
on
separation
of
powers.
now,
those
three
words...
separation
of
powers...
are
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
constitution,
but
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers
is
the
structural
cornerstone,
mainstay
of
the
constitution
itself.
the
real
distinction
that
is
drawn
in
midland
asphalt,
i
submit,
is
a
distinction
between
those
rights
that
rise
to
the
level
of
what
is
contained,
and
clearly
contained
in
the
constitution,
or
a
statute
on
the
one
hand,
and
private
expectations
on
the
other.
the
separation
of
powers
which
is
the
central
doctrine
that
links
all
of
the
first
three
articles
in
the
constitution
qualifies
the
private
expectations
contained
in
this
individual
contract--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
course
they
could.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but,
as
long
as
congress
has
not
changed
the
substantive
rule,
then
having
midland
asphalt,
which
ties
the
nature
of
the
right
to
avoid
trial
back
to
something
that
is
rooted
in
the
constitution,
in
the
absence
of
congressional
modification
of
the
rule
itself,
the
rule
remains
the
same,
and
that
i--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
congress
can't
change
separation
of
powers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
i
misheard,
mr.
chief
justice.
of
course
congress
couldn't
change
the
result
in
mitchell.
congress
could
change
the
re...
congress
could
change
the
cohen
doctrine.
i
misheard.
i
apologize.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
congress
could
not
change...
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
court
makes
it
quite
clear
that
it
is
based
on
separation
of
powers,
but
even
if
congress
could
change
it,
you
would
still
have...
it
would
still
meet
the
midland
asphalt
test,
which
of
course
is
the
relevant
issue
here,
which
would
be
a
statutory
basis.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
agree,
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
premises
that
underlies
midland
asphalt.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
precisely--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
and
that
is
precisely
our
point,
that
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
right
not
to
go
to
trial,
it
has
to
rise
to
a
certain
dignity,
and
that
dignity
is
emphasized,
or
that
dignity
is,
according
to
the
court's
unanimous
opinion
in
midland,
which
was
repeated
just
2
months
later
in
lauro
lines,
something
that
rises
to
the
level
of
a
statute
or
the
constitution.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
sure.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
surely
do
not,
justice
souter,
and
i
have
to
confess
that
that
separability
argument
did
not
make
it
into
the
final
draft
of
this
brief
as
a
fourth
argument,
but
i
will
say
that
i
think
it
would
be
a
perfectly
legitimate
ground,
alternative
ground,
on
which
the
court
could
affirm
the
tenth
circuit.
the
only
reason
it
isn't
in
here
is
because
of
the
tactical
judgment
that
the
other
three
arguments
were
so
strong
that
we
wanted
to
include
those
and
those
only.
turning
to
the
importance
issue,
i
just
want
to
make
this
very,
very
clear.
i
agree
with
justice
scalia,
it
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
and
it
overlaps
both
of
the
other
two.
now,
whether...
whether
the
cohen
exception
is
an
interpretation
of
the
word
final,
as
the
court
has
said
on
a
few
occasions,
or
whether
it
is
an
exception
to
section
1291,
as
the
court
has
said
on
many
more
occasions,
that
importance
language
is
not
something
that
the
court
has
read
into
1291.
mr.
roberts
is
absolutely
right
that
importance
does
not
appear
in
the
language
of
1291,
but
where
it
does
appear
is
in
the
cohen
opinion,
and
has
been
repeated
15
times
over
the
intervening
period
from
1949
to
1994,
and
as
a
consequence,
it
is
one
of
the
mainstays.
it
is
one
of
the
requirements.
now,
mr.
roberts
is
absolutely
right
that
it
has
never
been
the
deciding
factor.
that
is,
it
has
never
been
the
sole
deciding
factor,
but
two
facts
in
that
respect:
the
one
is
that
it
has
been
repeated
16
times,
and
the
second
is,
i
suspect...
well,
i
won't
suspect
anything.
justice
scalia
reminded
us
in
his
separate
concurrence
in
lauro
lines
that
it's
not
something
to
be
forgotten,
and
while
mr.
roberts
has
pointed
out
quite
correctly
that
that
was
only
a
concurrence,
no
member
of
the
majority
objected
to
it,
and
even
more
significantly--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--even
more
significant
is
the
fact
that
it
was
cited
with
approval
by
the
majority
in
the
court's
most
recent
opinion,
which
is
puerto
rico
sewer
&
aqueduct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
this
one
can
be
reviewed.
this
one
can
be
reviewed
on
final
appeal,
just
as
1291
says,
and
i'll
talk
about
that
more
in
just
a
moment.
if
private
expectations
arising
from--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
but
i
think
the
clear
thrust
of
all
of
those...
of
cohen,
taken
together
with
all
of
the
other
subsequent
cases
that
have
interpreted
this
importance
review,
particularly
the
most
recent
cases,
the
ones
that
have
come
down
in
about
the
past
5
years,
i
certainly
would
not
be
as
presumptuous
as
to
tell
this
court
what
their
opinions
really
mean,
but
i
will
tell
you
that
as
i
read
them,
importance
is
still
there.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
that
is
correct.
that
is
clearly
correct,
and
that,
of
course,
is
our
principal
position.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
could
not--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--and
that's
why
we
advance
this
as
a
separate
issue.
it's
not
the
only
ground
on
which
we
win,
but
if
private
expectations
now
make
the
grade,
then
forget
about
what
the
court
has
been
saying
over
these
45
years
in
16
different
opinions
about
the
importance
of
importance.
just...
excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it's
a
pretty
good
line.
[laughter]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
briefly,
the
petitioner's
contention
that
his
claim
satisfies
the
importance
requirement
because
of
the
need
to
honor
settlement
agreements
is
completely
beside
the
point.
we
agree
that
settlement
agreements
are
in
the
public
interest,
but
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
fraud
is
in
the
public
interest,
and
once
again
i
will
simply
refer
back
to
what
i
said
earlier,
justice
ginsburg,
that
though
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
what
the
district
court
found,
i
think
the
most
efficient
thing
to
do
is
simply
to
adopt
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
that
respect.
but
even
if
you
assume,
for
purposes
of
argument,
that
the
district
court
did
not
find
fraud,
and
that
the
review
the
petitioner
seeks
here
is
a
review
of
the
standard
by
which
the
court
determined
that
rescission
was
proper,
that
legal
issue
involves
nothing
more
than
utah
state
law
dealing
with
matters
of
contract
and
evidence.
it
is
plainly
not
one
that
warrants
interlocutory
appeal,
if
the
importance
requirement
means
anything
at
all.
now,
finally,
even
if
the
court
were
now
to
conclude
that
it
did
not
know
what
it
was
talking
about
when
it
drew
a
distinction
between
public
and
private
rights
in
midland
asphalt,
and
even
if
the
importance
requirement
is
now
to
be
eliminated
because
we
now
know
what
we
have
not
known
for
45
years...
that
it
involves
inquiries
inappropriate
for
courts...
piecemeal
appeal
would
still
be
inappropriate
in
this
case,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
petitioner's
claim
is
effectively
reviewable
after
trial,
because
the
essence
of
the
petitioner's
claimed
right
need
not
be
characterized,
and
therefore
under
this
court's
decisions
in
van
cauwenberghe
and
midland
asphalt
should
not
be
characterized
as
involving
a
right
not
to
go
to
trial.
the
petitioner's
entire
case
depends
on
this
court's
acceptance
of
its
premise
that
the
essence
of
the
right
it
claims
is
the
right
not
to
stand
trial,
but
the
premise
itself
fails.
first,
as
already
discussed,
the
right
not
to
go
to
trial
in
the
sense
relevant
to
cohen
must
be
rooted
in
the
constitution
or
in
statutory
law.
second,
under
the
standards
set
by
this
court
in
van
cauwenberghe
and
midland
asphalt,
the
essence
of
the
claim
here
is
something
other
than
a
right
not
to
stand
trial.
the
court
pointed
out
in
van
cauwenberghe
that
in
some
sense
any
litigant
who
has
a
meritorious
pretrial
basis
for
dismissal
has
a
right
not
to
go
to
trial,
and
that
is
true
across
a
broad
range
of
possible
defenses.
if
the
case
is
dismissed
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds
or
on
personal
jurisdictional
grounds,
there
will
be
no
trial,
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
court
cautioned
in
midland
asphalt
that
we
must
not
play
word
games
in
this
area
with
what
is
really
the
essence
of
the
right
not
to
go
to
trial.
we
submit
that...
oh,
we
submit
that
where
you
have
an
option
between
two
characterizations,
two
interpretations,
one
of
which
will
increase
the
number
of
interlocutory
appeals
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
section
1291,
and
the
other
of
which
will
control
the
number
of
those
interlocutory
appeals,
that
under
van
cauwenberghe
and
midland
the
better
approach
clearly
is
to
limit
rather
than
to
increase--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--perhaps
nothing
else
on
the
60(b)
list,
but
i
really
see
no
difference
between
this
and
the
statute
of
limitations.
if
i
have
my
case
dismissed
because
the
statute
of
limitations
is
run,
there's
going
to
be
no
trial,
and
similarly,
as
in
van
cauwenberghe,
if
service
of
personal
jurisdiction
is
improper,
there's
going
to
be
no
trial.
moreover,
and
this
is
an
even
more
important
point,
when
you
have
these
two
alternative
interpretations,
which
one
of
them
do
you
pick.
as
a
matter
of
acceptable
usage
of
the
english
language,
this
agreement
could
be
interpreted,
just
as
mr.
roberts
interprets
it,
as
conferring
a
right
not
to
go
forward
with
the
trial.
but
there
are
three
other
options
that
are
equally
acceptable
as
a
matter
of
appropriate
english
language,
one
is
that
what
they
really
wanted
was
a
bottom
line
decision
as
to
how
much
money
they
were
going
to
have
to
pay.
they
wanted
a
limitation
on
their
damages.
second
is
that
they
wanted
the
lawsuit
settled,
and
behind
them,
and
the
third
is,
they
wanted
the
use
of
the
trademark.
now,
when
you
have
that
kind
of
a
choice
between
picking...
between
characterizations
that
will
increase
interlocutory
appeals
and
those
that
will
control
them,
van
cauwenberghe
very
clearly
said
which
of
those
choices
we
should
make,
and
that
language
is
as
follows:
because
of
the
important
interests
furthered
by
the
final
judgment
rule,
and
the
ease...
the
ease
with
which
certain
pretrial
claims
for
dismissal
may
be
alleged
to
entail
the
right
not
to
stand
trial,
we
should
examine
the
nature
of
the
right
asserted
with
special
care.
now,
if
you
apply
that
special
care
test
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
submit
common
sense
tells
you
that
the
essence
of
this
claim,
even
without
the
van
cauwenberghe
tilt,
tells
you
that
the
essence
of
the
claim
was
not
the
right
not
to
stand
trial.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
huge
corporation,
and
their
lawyers
and
their
employees
are
in
court
every
day.
it
just
defies
common
sense
that
what
they
really
wanted
was
to
avoid
one
more
courtroom
in
the
district
of
utah.
i
submit
that
what
common
sense
tells
us
is
that
what
they
really
wanted
was
the
bottom
line
determination
as
to
how
much
money
they
were
going
to
own...
they
were
going
to
owe,
get
the
obligation
of
the
lawsuit
out
of
the
way,
and
acquire
the
right
to
the
trademark.
the
petitioner's
policy
argument
that
we
need
to
be
concerned
about
crowding
the
district
court
documents,
or
dockets,
fails
for
several
reasons.
first
and
most
important,
policy
arguments
about
how
the
crowded
district
and
court
of
appeals
dockets
should
be
adjusted
should
be
left
to
that
branch
of
government
that
has
been
saying
ever
since
1789
that
appeals
from
district
court
decisions
should
only
be
from
final
judgments.
second--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
event
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
true,
if
they
were
prescient
enough,
justice
scalia--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--to
know
that
it
was
later...
the
fraud
issue
would
later
arise.
i'll
take
it
on
that
ground.
you
may
want
to
write
it
on
a
brighter
ground,
or
on
a
broader
ground.
the
second
reason
that
the
policy
argument
concerning
congestion
is
beside
the
point
is
that
it
proves
too
much.
if
it
is
really
true,
as
it
is
not,
as
i'll
show
in
just
a
moment,
that
the
real
problem
with
congestion
in
our
courts
is
in
the
district
courts
rather
than
in
the
appellate
courts,
then
what
we
ought
to
do
is
repeal
section
1291
altogether,
and
that
judgment,
again,
ought
to
be
made
by
congress.
finally,
the
argument
is
factually
flawed.
as
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
conclusion...
the
focus
of
the
federal
court
study
committee
when
it
did
its
work
was
on
the
congestion...
was
on
the
problem
of
congestion
in
the
appellate
courts
rather
than
in
the
district
courts,
and
in
any
event,
to
whatever
extent
those
things
need
to
be
balanced,
it
should
be
done
by
congress.

absolutely.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
they
both
involve
fraud,
both
the
claim
on
the
merits
and
also
the
setting
aside
of
the
settlement
agreement,
and
many
of
those
fraudulent
issues
will
be
the
same.
there
is
not
a
complete
overlap,
and
as
i
say,
it
was
solely
a
tactical
judgment,
and
i
would
be
delighted
if
you
overruled
my
tactical
judgment
and
ruled
in
our
favor
on
that
ground.
with
regard,
very
briefly,
to
the...
the
petitioner
completely
misunderstands
our
argument
with
respect
to
1292(b).
whether
they
did
or
did
not
avail
themselves
of
1292(b)
is
in
our
view
irrelevant.
that
doesn't
matter
at
all
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
the
only
thing
we
are
saying
is
that,
as
the
chief
justice
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
court
has
said
that
this
is,
whether
you
call
it
an
interpretation
of
the
word
final,
or
an
exception
to
the
cohen
rule
of
law,
has
made
very
clear
it
is
to
be
very
narrowly
construed.
on
occasion
it
has
used
the
term,
utmost
strictness,
and
our
only
point
with
respect
to
1292(b)
is
that
that
is
another
reason
to
continue
with
that
strict
approach,
because
in
the
event
you
do
have
some
truly
meritorious
cases
that
really
do
need
to
be
appealed
by
breaking
up
the
trial
right
in
the
middle
of
it,
the
safety
valve,
there
is
another
safety
valve
applicable
to
1292(b).
that
does
not
say
that
you
overrule
cohen.
all
it
says
is
that
the
momentum
that
i
see
building
in
recent
years
toward
a
narrow
construction
of
the
cohen
rule
should
continue.
one
final
observation.
as
i
count
them
up,
in
any
collateral
order
case,
any
one,
there
are
at
least
four
requirements
which
this
court...
by
which
this
court
has
controlled
access
to
interlocutory
appeal.
they
are
the
three
that
are
stated
by
coopers
&
lybrand
v.
livesay,
except
that
the
second
one,
justice
ginsburg,
is
really
two.
it's
the
separateness,
and
importance,
so
you
really
have
those
four.
but
in
a
case
involving
an
asserted
right
to
avoid
trial,
you
have
two
more,
because
of
the
midland
asphalt
rule
and
because
of
this
characterization
problem
that
we've
been
talking
about.
so
at
a
maximum,
six
hurdles
that
you
have
to
get
over,
six
controls...
six
control
points
by
which
this
court
can
limit
the
number
of
interlocutory
appeals.
the
only
way
that
the
petitioner
can
win
this
case
is
for
the
court
to
say
that
three
of
those
six
no
longer
count,
and
i
submit
that
to
do
so
would
be
squarely
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
cautioned
in
firestone
tire
&
rubber
when
it
said
that
such
a
movement
would,
and
i
quote
from
the
court,
transform
the
limited
exception
carved
out
in
cohen
into
a
license
for
broad
disregard
for
the
finality
rule
imposed
by
congress
in
section
1291.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i've
nothing
further.
