chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
that
court
held
that
petitioner
digital
equipment
must
await
the
end
of
trial
before
appealing
the
district
court's
denial
of
its
claim
that
it
had
the
right
to
avoid
trial
altogether
pursuant
to
its
settlement
agreement
with
respondent
desktop
direct.
the
district
court
had
rescinded
that
settlement
agreement
and
vacated
desktop
direct's
dismissal
after
finding
that
a
factfinder
could
conclude
that
digital
failed
to
disclose
facts
to
desktop
that
would
cause
desktop
not
to
accept
the
settlement
offer.
the
tenth
circuit
refused
to
hear
digital's
appeal
from
that
ruling
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine
because
it
determined
that
the
issue
of
the
enforceability
of
settlement
agreements
was
not
"important
enough"
to
justify
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
district
court
order
stated
that
he
was
granting
the
motion
because
a
factfinder
could
determine
that
digital
failed
to
disclose
facts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
are
a
number
of
grounds
for
appeal,
the
first
being
that
that
is
the
wrong
standard.
he
threw
out
the
settlement
agreement,
vacated
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
because
a
factfinder
could
determine.
that's
plainly
the
wrong
standard.
at
the
very
least,
a
factfinder
should
find
fraud,
and
we
think
must
find
fraud
under
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
that
was
not
done
here,
but
there
is
a
final
decision
on
the
validity
of
the
settlement
agreement.
the
settlement
agreement
has
been
thrown
out.
the
motion
to
rescind
it
was
granted,
and
as
the
tenth
circuit
found,
that's
all
the
district
court
is
going
to
do
on
that
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
issue
on
appeal
is
the
validity
of
the
settlement
agreement.
that
is
what
gives
us
our
right
to
avoid
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
the
tenth
circuit
found
that
the
issue
on
appeal
was
separable
from
the
merits
and
it
was
correct,
for
this
reason:
the
merits
concern
the
validity
of
their
claim
that
we
violated
their
trademark
rights.
they
filed
that
complaint,
of
course,
before
any
settlement
discussions
took
place.
they
presumably
felt
that
all
they
needed
to
know
was
there
at
that
point.
now,
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
settlement
agreement
raises
entirely
different
questions
about
what
was
said
during
negotiations,
what
was
not
said.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
their
allegations
with
respect
to
the
settlement
may
be
relevant
on
damages.
that's
the
only
thing
that
they
allege
at
this
point,
but
even
there,
it
is,
as
the
court
has
said
in
mitchell
v.
forsyth,
conceptually
distinct.
in
mitchell
v.
forsyth,
of
course,
there
was
complete
overlap
on
the
facts.
the
question
was
qualified
immunity,
and
you
needed
to
know
what
the
allegations
were
before
you
could
judge
that,
but
the
court
said
because
in
mitchell
you
take
as
true
the
allegations
and
ask
if
that
violated
a
substantive
legal
standard,
that
was
conceptually
distinct
from
whether
or
not
the
allegations
were
true.
same
thing
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
let
me
be
precise.
we
are
foreclosed,
as
we
understand
the
record
and
as
i
gather
desktop
understands
it
as
well,
from
arguing
the
validity
of
the
settlement
agreement.
that
has
been
decided,
but...
and
it
is
important
to
emphasize...
no
one
has
found
fraud.
we
are
not
foreclosed
from
arguing
whether
on
damages
or
some
other
issue,
that
there
was
no
fraud.
the
error
in
the
district
court's
ruling
is
that
he
vacated
the
settlement
agreement
without
making
any
findings
with
respect
to
fraud
at
all,
so
yes,
we
are
foreclosed
from
arguing
the
validity
of
the
settlement
agreement,
but
not
from
arguing
that
there
was
no
fraud.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
cause
of
action
under
utah
law
or
whatever
other
law
would
govern
for
that
type
of
damages.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
contract,
but
i'm
not
sure
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--this
is
a
contract,
but
this
is
what
happened.
they
went
to
the
district
court
and
they
said,
rescind
the
contract.
i
don't
think
an
action
alleging
that
the
contract
is
invalid
is
a
breach
of
the
contract.
the
district
court
did
that.
he
threw
out
the
contract,
and
then
they
went--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
i
don't
believe...
i
don't...
i'm
not
certain,
but
i
don't
believe
you
can
maintain
an
action
for
breach
of
contract
for
filing
a
federal
lawsuit
when
the
district
court
has
said,
you
have
the
right
to
file
this
lawsuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that,
but
i
still
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there's
no
contractual
obligation
binding
them
at
the
time
they
reinstituted
their
litigation.
that
contract--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--under
the
settlement
agreement--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--by
its
plain
terms.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
breach
would
come
from
the
filing
and
pursuit
of
the
lawsuit.
at
the
time
they
did
that,
the
federal
court
had
said
the
contract
is
invalid.
you
have
the
right
to
go
ahead
and
sue.
i
don't
think
you
can
maintain
an
action
for
breach
of
contract
after
the
contract
had
been
thrown
out,
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
are
irreparably
harmed
by
forcing
us
to
go
to
trial,
to
wait
until
the
end
of
trial
to
pursue
our
appeal.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
any
of
the
damages
that
would
flow
from
that
would
certainly
not
be
calculable,
the
damages
to
our
commercial
program,
our
venture,
the
losses
we
sustained
there,
are
not
sufficiently
calculable
to
be
recoverable
even
if
there
could
be
a
breach
of
contract
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
right,
and
as
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
those
are
the
hurdles
to
our
recovery
of
any
damages,
that
it
is
not
a
breach
to
rescind
the
contract,
and
once
the
contract
is
rescinded,
you
can't
argue
breach
because
there's
no
contract
to
breach.
now,
our
case--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
wilfulness
i
guess
is
an
element
of
the
fraud
claim,
but
the
damages
claim--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
at
all.
we
have
a
much
stronger
case
on
separability
than
the
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
found
cohen
applicable.
the
double
jeopardy
clause--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
not,
your
honor,
in
this
sense.
i
do
think
there
is
a
complete
separation
between
the
issues
because
the
question
of
factual
overlap
is
not
the
test
to
determine
if
the
issues
are
separate
or
not.
in
mitchell,
the
question
was
qualified
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
absolutely
not.
it
is
not
sufficient.
if
it
were,
the
claim
in
mitchell
would
not
have
been
appealable,
because
obviously
there's
a
common
element
there,
and
the
double
jeopardy
cases
would
not
be
appealable,
because
there
are
common
elements
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
our
understanding,
either.
we
don't
think
you
do,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
claim
preclusion
test,
it
fails
the
second
element
of
the
cohen
test.
there
is
overlap
there.
there's
not
here,
because
on
appeal
our
argument
will
be
1)
the
district
court
applied
the
wrong
standard.
could
someone
find
fraud
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
vacating
the
settlement
agreement,
2)
even
if,
looking
at
the
merits,
there
is
no
duty
on
our
part
to
disclose
material
facts
to
our
adversary
during
settlement
negotiations.
that's
conceptually
distinct,
as
mitchell
put
it,
from
the
merit
of
the
allegations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our
claim
is
that
we
have
the
right
not
to
be
sued.
that's
set
forth
expressly
in
the
settlement
agreement.
that
may
well
be
the
same
argument
in
the
claim
preclusion
cases,
but
in
the
claim
preclusion
cases
there
is...
the
issues
are
not
separate.
in
ours,
they
are.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
need
to
examine
the
factual
allegations
and
perhaps
even--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
the
claim
preclusion
case,
it
is
different
because
you
need
to
examine
it
and
perhaps
even
wait
until
you've
determined
exactly
what
the
facts
are
to
see
exactly,
precisely
what
the
claim
is
or
what
the
issue
is
that's
allegedly
precluded.
it's
very
different
in
our
situation,
where
we
are
talking
about
a
legal
standard,
a
legal
issue
on
appeal,
as
opposed
to
the
merits
of
the
factual
allegations,
and
in
fact
as
in
mitchell,
our
argument
on
the
standard
even
accepts
as
true
the
factual
allegations
and
says,
even
if
that's
true,
do
we
have
a
duty
during
settlement
negotiations
to
disclose
facts
to
our
adversary,
and
the
answer
we
will
argue,
if
we're
afforded
the
opportunity
on
appeal,
is
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
confer
a
right
to
avoid
trial.
it
is
much
more
like
the
speedy
trial
right
this
court
considered
in
mcdonald.
it
is
the
delay
between
the
event
and
the
trial
that
is
the
harm,
and
the
holding
of
a
trial
does
not
increase
that
delay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
this
is
the
way
the
court
analyzes
all
of
these
questions.
it
focuses
on
the
exact
nature
of
the
right.
for
example,
in
the
speedy
trial
of
a
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
element,
as
the
courts
pointed
out...
in
the
van
cauwenberghe
case
it
said
the
critical
question,
in
mitchell
it
said
the
heart
of
the
issue...
is
this
a
right
to
avoid
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
not
easy,
and
there
is
word
play,
but
the
manner
in
which
word
play
must
be
avoided
is
to
make
every
claim
a
right
not
to
be
tried.
that's
an
easy
example.
if
you
have
a
defense,
i
didn't
do
it,
if
you
didn't
do
it,
then
you
have
no
right
to
be
sued
under
it,
but
that's
not
the
way
the
court
has
pursued
the
analysis.
it
has
asked,
is
there
a
right
not
to
be
tried.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
several
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
it's
not
clear
that
it's
available.
1292(b)
is
available
for
orders
that
may
not
be
appealed
under
1291.
we
think
this
may
be
appealed
under
1291.
therefore,
we
do
not
have
the
right
to
go
under
1292(b).
second
of
all,
at
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--at
the
time
the
appeal
was
filed,
the
circuits
were
unanimous
that
in
this
situation
you
had
a
right
of
appeal
under
1291.
the
second,
the
fifth,
and
the
eleventh,
the
only
published
opinions,
all
said,
this
is
a
final
decision
under
cohen,
you
may
pursue
it,
and
therefore
it's
not
at
all
inexplicable,
as
our
friends
on
the
other
side
point
out,
why
we
went
this
way.
second
of
all,
it's
not
even
clear
that
we
would
have
a
right
under
1292(b).
it
is
available
only
under
certain
limited
circumstances,
and
it's
certainly
not
clear
that
the
district
court
would
think
that
those
circumstances
were
met
here.
it's
doubly
discretionary.
you
need
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
before
you
pursue
that
route.
and
finally,
some
courts
have
taken
the
position
of
holding
it
against
a
party
if
they
assert
an
alternative
basis,
as
you've
suggested.
there
are
cases
where
a
court
says,
you
must
not
have
much
confidence
in
your
1291
position,
because
you
went
ahead
and
sought
certification
under
1292(b).
when
we
filed
this
appeal,
the
law
was,
to
the
extent
it
had
been
decided,
every
circuit
in
published
opinions
said
we
had
a
right
under
1291,
and
that's
the
route
that
we
took.
justice
scalia
mentioned
earlier
that
the
issue
of
how
important
a
right
is
or
is
not
is
one
that...
well,
in
this
case
that
desktop
argues
is
determinative.
we
think,
even
under
that
standard,
our
right
is
an
important
one.
settlements
play
a
critical
role
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
system,
and
when
we
have
an
agreement
that
purports
to
resolve
the
litigation
between
the
parties
and
precludes
any
further
litigation,
we
ought
to
be
very
sure
that
it
does
not
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
there
are
policies
of
judicial
economy
and
efficiency
that
support
the
final
judgment.
we
think
that
we
promote
those
policies
in
this
situation.
when
you
have
a
settlement
between
the
parties
that
resolves
the
merits
and
precludes
litigation,
it
is
in
the
interest
of
judicial
efficiency
and
economy
to
make
sure
that
that
really
does
not
do
what
it
says
before
imposing
on
the
parties
and
the
courts,
the
system
as
a
whole,
the
costs
and
burdens
and
expense
of
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
two
key
words
in
section
1291,
final
decisions,
and
what
this
court
said
in
cohen,
and
what
it
has
said
repeatedly
in
applying
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
is
we
are
interpreting
that
phrase.
if
you
meet
the
various
cohen
tests,
then
it
is
a
final
decision.
it
is
not
a
judicial
exception
to
the
final
decision
rule,
it
is
an
interpretation
of
the
final
decision
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
an
interpretation
of
final
to
say
that
there
are
some
circumstances
when
there
are
not
final
judgments,
but
final
decisions,
as
the
statute
specifies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
in
the
general
case
you
will
have
a
final
decision
when
there
is
a
final
judgment,
and
there
is
nothing
further
for
the
district
court
to
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
it's
unclear.
what
1292
says
is
that
it's
limited
to
those
situations
where
you
have
interlocutory
orders
that
aren't
final
decisions,
and
if
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
there
are...
if
it's
a
final
decision
under
cohen,
of
course,
you
don't
need
to
put
yourself
at
the
mercy
of
the
district
courts
to
say
it
is
certified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
1292(a)--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--proceeding
under
1291
which
gives
us
an
appeal
as
of
right.
1292(b)
is
doubly
discretionary
both
with
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
so
if
you
proceed
in
a
situation
where
you
say,
if
you
allow
us
to
appeal,
we
want
to
and
we
will,
it
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
under
1291
we
have
the
right
to
appeal
and
here's
our
notice
of
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
authority
of
the
cases,
one
of
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
where
the
courts
have
held
it
against
you
if
you're
trying
to
proceed
under
1291
that
you
tried
under
1292.
it's
not
always
the
case
that
the
courts
allow
alternative
and
inconsistent
arguments
without
penalty.
to
get
back
to
the
question
of
statutory
authority,
there
have
been
a
number
of
theories
advanced,
ways
to
limit
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
the
importance
is
one.
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
what
the
court
is
about
in
all
of
these
cases.
it
is
construing
a
statute,
a
statute
that
has
one
criterion,
and
one
criterion
only,
and
that
is
finality.
nowhere
in
section
1291
are
federal
courts
given
the
authority
to
pick
and
choose
which
issues
may
be
appealed
and
which
may
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--cohen
v.
beneficial
is
a
statutory
interpretation.
the
elements
in
cohen
all
relate
to
finality.
the
first
prong,
has
this
been
conclusively
determined,
obviously
related
to
finality.
the
second
prong,
is
it
separate
from
the
merits?
again,
related
to
finality,
because
it
will
be
decided
in
part
even
as
the
merits
go
on.
and
is
it
effectively
unreviewable
after
trial,
if
it
is,
it
is
because
it
is
in
a
sense
final
at
that
point.
the
parts
of
the
test
that
do
not
have
anything
to
do
with
finality
are
the
importance
of
the
right,
or
even
more
so,
whether
or
not
it
has
an
explicit
statutory
or
constitutional
basis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
many
others,
the
attachment
rights
at
issue
in
the
swift
case,
a
variety
of
others,
might
not
seem
important
if
courts
were
put
in
the
position
of
deciding
what
is
and
isn't,
and
i
have
no
idea--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
it
will--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
point...
what
i
meant
by
effectively
unreviewable,
your
honor,
is
if
we
don't
get
review
at
this
point,
we
will
finally,
once
and
for
all,
lose
our
right--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
avoid
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
be
final
for
us.
it's
over
and
done
with.
if
we
are
forced
to
go
to
trial--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
the
distinction
which
was
spelled
out
in
lauro
lines
itself,
and
which
applies
in
the
other
cases
as
well,
is
that
it
is
not
a
complete
right
to
avoid
trial.
that's
the
line
that
the
court
is
drawing.
here,
we
have
a
complete
right
to
avoid
trial.
it's
not
simply
trial
here
as
opposed
to
somewhere
else.
it's
not
simply
trial
under
some
circumstances
as
opposed
to
others,
as
in
van
cauwenberghe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
this
prong
of
the
cohen
test
that
the
claim
preclusion
issue
fails,
it's
the
second
prong,
the
separateness.
i
don't
dispute
that
it
may
share
all
the
attributes
on
this
issue,
the
unreviewability
issue,
but
it's
the
separateness
issue
where
it
falls
short.
now,
the
idea
that
the
court
should
pick
and
choose
between
different
issues
based
on
importance
strikes
me
as
extremely
problematic.
there
are
no
standards
to
guide
this
court's
decision.
it
mixes
the
merits
with
jurisdiction.
if
the
court
thinks
that
qualified
immunity
is
a
very
troubling
or
important
issue,
we'll
hear
the
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
the
court
said
in
lauro
lines
and
the
others
is,
you
need
to
take
a
very
close
look
at
the
nature
of
the
right,
and
that's
what
the
courts
have
done
in
the
statutes
of
limitations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i...
in
response,
justice
scalia,
i
would
just
reiterate,
importance
is
not
something
that's
found
anywhere
in
the
statute.
what
the
court
is
about
is
interpreting
the
statute,
and
it
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
allocation
of
roles
between
the
courts
and
the
congress
to
say
that
the
courts
are
going
to
decide
what
issues
may
be
appealed
and
what
may
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
what
the
court
has
said
repeatedly
is
that
it
is.
look
at
abney,
look
at
mitchell...
the
other
cases...
it
doesn't
say,
here's
this
exception
we've
created,
this
case
comes
within
it,
so
we
allow
appeal.
it
says,
no,
because
of
these
reasons,
this
is
a
final
decision
under
section
1291.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point,
your
honor,
was
not
that
the
courts
have
repeatedly
said
it,
but
that
they
have
viewed
it
as
an
interpretation
of
section
1291.
it's
not
simply
saying
it,
but
that
is
how
they
understand
their
role,
and
if
that
is
the
role
of
the
courts,
then
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
an
importance
test,
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
a
limitation
based
on
the
source
of
the
right,
and
getting
to
the
merits
of
importance--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
what
i'm
saying
is,
importance...
there's
no
stare
decisis
force
behind
the
importance
test
as
understood
by
the
court
below,
because
this
court
has
never
rejected
a
cohen
appeal
because
it
thought
that
the
right
at
issue
was
not
important
enough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
may
be,
your
honor,
in
45
years,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
no.
the
settlement
agreement
is
the
only
additional
category,
because
it's
the
only
one
that
confers
an
absolute
right
to
avoid
trial.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
least
on
the
second.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
issue.
not
the
case,
not
the
decision,
but
this
issue,
and
it
does
conclusively
determine
the
issue
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--either
way,
i
think
this
case
is
not
appealable,
but
the
way
i
have
worked
that
one
out
for
myself,
justice
ginsburg,
is
the
following.
the
tenth
circuit
is
absolutely
right
that
the
district
court's
opinion
on
this
matter
is
somewhat
cryptic,
but
the
tenth
circuit
went
on
to
conclude,
and
i
think
absolutely
correctly,
that
the
court
nevertheless
did
find
fraud,
because
in
the
tenth
circuit's
language,
it
rescinded
the
agreement,
and
i
think
that
for
purposes
of
this
court's
work,
which
has
to
decide
the
important
legal
issues
in
this
case,
the
most
efficient
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
simply
accept
the
district
court's...
excuse
me,
the
court
of
appeals
characterization
as
to
what
the
district
court
really
did,
but
in
either
event,
that
issue
should
not
be
appealable.
now,
with
regard
to
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
to
begin
with
fraud,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
fraud.
its
discussion
of
that
issue
is
at
page
4(a)
of
the
petition
appendix.
it's
one
paragraph.
it
does
not
find
fraud.
that
seems
to
be
a
key
element
in
the
respondent's
case.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
no
court...
district
court,
court
of
appeals...
has
found
that
we
were
guilty
of
fraud.
on
the
question
of
our--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
erroneous
district
court
standard
that
it
could
set
it
aside
if
it
believed
that
a
factfinder
could
find
fraud.
he
thought
that
was
the
standard.
that's
what
his
order
says
at
petition
appendix
13(a).
that's
what
we
are
trying
to
get
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
appeal
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
even
know
what
fraud-related
means.
he
said--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
and
our
issue
before
the
tenth
circuit
will
be
the
purely
legal
one:
is
that
the
correct
standard?
do
you
throw
out
a
settlement
agreement
if
a
factfinder
could
find
fraud?
the
answer
to
that
to
me
seems
clear.
on
the
question
of,
are
we
being
denied
our
right
to
review
altogether,
we
are.
our
right
is
the
right
to
avoid
trial.
we
will
lose
that
right
altogether
if
we
have
to
go
to
trial.
now,
is
it
true
that
that
right
secures
other
rights
in
interest?
of
course,
but
that
is
true
in
every
case
under
cohen.
the
double
jeopardy
defendant
has
an
interest
in
avoiding
trial.
if
he
pursues
that
interest,
it
also
protects
the
interest
in
not
being
found
guilty.
that's
not
a
distinguishing
factor
in
this
case
at
all.
is
cohen
an
interpretation
of
1291,
or
a
judicial
exception
to
the
rules
of
jurisdiction
created
by
congress?
it's
the
former.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
authority
that
this
court
has
to
create
exceptions
to
the
jurisdictional
rules
that
congress
creates,
and
even
though
the
term,
final
decisions,
is
subject
to
interpretation,
it
doesn't
mean
that
all
bets
are
off
and
the
court
can
say,
we're
going
to
allow
an
appeal
of
issues
that
we
think
are
important.
think
of
how
that
would
look
in
the
different
circuits.
different
circuits
will
have
very
different
views
of
what's
important.
the
issues
in
securities
cases
may
seem
important
to
the
second
circuit.
issues
in
mining
cases
may
seem
important
to
the
tenth
circuit,
and
this
court
would
have
to
umpire
all
of
those
decisions.
the
word
importance
does
appear,
my
brother
counted,
15
or
16
times.
never
has
that
word
been
used
to
support
an
analysis
such
as
that
engaged
in
by
the
tenth
circuit
below...
not
once.
finally,
on
the
statute
of
limitations
cases,
the
distinction
again
is
set
forth
in
those
cases.
they
are
not
a
right
not
to
be
tried,
they're
a
right
to
be
tried
within
a
certain
period.
thank
you,
your
honor.
