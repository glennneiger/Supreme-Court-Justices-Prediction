m.

suppose
the
trial
court
had
made
findings
on
the
factual
issues,
making
a
finding
that
the
digital
corporation
did
know
of
the
desktop
name,
could
the
ruling
in
those
findings
then
be
the
subject
of
a
separate
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
separable
from
the
merits,
that's
right
at
the
heart
of
the
merits...
what
the
digital
corporation
knew
and
when
they
knew
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
there
were
a
finding
that
digital
knew
at
the
time
the
agreement
was
negotiated
and
beforehand,
and
before
it
began
using
the
desktop
name,
that
desktop
had
a
trademark
interest
in
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
highly
relevant
to
the
substantive
litigation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
roberts,
you
stated
that
you
cannot
ask
for
a
1292
appeal
under
1292(b)
if
the
order
is
appealable
under
1291?
have
we
said
that?
is
that
case
law,
or
is
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
it
says
that
when
the
district
judge
is
making
a
civil...
in
a
civil
action
an
order
not
otherwise
appealable
under
this
section,
so
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
inconsistent
with
saying
that
you
can
ask
for
a
1292(b)
order
and
still
maintain
your
cohen
position
under
1291.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
indicated
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
do
that,
and
certainly
the
statute
does
not
indicate
that.
the
only
qualification
under
1292(b)
is
that
it
not
be
appealable
under
1292(a).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you're
proceeding
under
1291.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
certainly
not
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
language
or
with
any
authority
that
you've
cited.
