justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
roberts,
the
district
court
order
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
district
court
thought
there
was
a
factfinding
determination
necessary
on
whether
the
settlement
agreement
should
be
set
aside.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
appeal
taken
was
on
the
theory
that
no
fact
finding
could
be
allowed
on
that
question?
