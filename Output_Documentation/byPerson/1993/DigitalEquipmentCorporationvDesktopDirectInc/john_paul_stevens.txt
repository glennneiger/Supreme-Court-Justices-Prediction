justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
may
we
take
the
case
a
step
further?
supposing
on
remand
you
lose,
but
then
you
appeal,
and
after...
you
know,
assume
we
don't
agree
with
your
present
appeal,
and
after
months
of
litigation
you
ultimately
prevail
and
have
the
court
of
appeals
rule
that
the
settlement
agreement
was
indeed
valid
from
the
beginning.
it
therefore
would
follow,
would
it
not,
that
they
had
breached
the
settlement
agreement,
and
you
would
be
entitled
to
damages
for
all
that
happened
in
the
interim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
breach
of
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
a
contract,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
we're
assuming
the
court
of
appeals
will
reverse
the
district
court.
that's
your
position...
the
district
court
was
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
district
court
has
erroneously
said
you
have
the
right
to
file
this
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
sued,
that's
your
whole--
--it's
strange
to
say
that
utah
doesn't
recognize
a
breach
of
contract
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts--
--you
may
be
arguing
to
the
contrary
later
on
in
this
proceeding.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
go
back
a
second
to
the
cohen
opinion
itself.
you
say
that
the
word
important
there
is
used,
but
it
only
says,
it's
too
important
to
be
denied
review
altogether.
that's
the
only
significance
of
importance
there.
