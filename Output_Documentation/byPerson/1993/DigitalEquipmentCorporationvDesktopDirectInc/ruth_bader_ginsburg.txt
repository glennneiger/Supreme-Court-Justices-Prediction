bader

mr.
roberts,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
those
first
two
criteria.
you
seem
to
present
an
agreement
between
the
parties
that
meet
the
first
two
requirements,
but
this
is
a
jurisdictional
question,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
we
don't
think
that
you
did
meet
those
requirements,
it
doesn't
matter
that
you
and
your
adversary
agree
that
you
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
justice
o'connor
started
to
ask
you
about
the...
a
factfinder
could
find.
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way:
suppose
you
lose
here,
and
we
say
there
is
no
immediate
appeal.
are
you
foreclosed
from
going
back
to
the
lower
court
and
saying,
the
district
judge
said
only
a
trier
could
find...
a
trier
could
find
the
other
way,
so
we
would
like
you
now
to
determine
that
question
finally,
and
if
you
determine
it
in
our
favor,
the
settlement
will
indeed
stick.
are
you
foreclosed
from
making
such
an
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
a...
where
does
your
right
not
to
be
sued
arise
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
if
that
right
has
been
breached,
isn't
compensation
for
that
right
adequate
to
redress
any
injury
you
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
claim
preclusion?
you
mention
double
jeopardy
on
the
criminal
side,
but
isn't
the
closest
analogy,
since
you
have
a
civil
case
here,
claim
preclusion,
and
it
was
not
my
understanding
that
if
you
unsuccessfully
plead
claim
preclusion
that
you
have,
under
cohen
v.
beneficial,
a
right
to
immediately
appeal
the
adverse
ruling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
claim
preclusion
a
right
not
to
be
sued
on
this
claim,
and
isn't
that
the
heart
of
your
argument,
that
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
sued,
and
that
that's
what
claim
preclusion
is
on
the
civil
side?
it
is
the
analogue
to
double
jeopardy
on
the
criminal
side,
only
there
is
no
cohen
v.
beneficial
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
aren't
they?
there's
factual
overlap,
perhaps,
but
the
issue
is
whether
a
court
found
against
you.
it's
a
simple,
factual
issue
of
whether
a
court
previously
found
against
you
on
this
point.
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
doesn't
matter.
that's
no
overlap,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
you
just
said
the
cases
are
not
so
completely
neat
and
tidy,
and
you
chose
this
route.
you
didn't
try
as
an
alternate...
not
the
exclusive,
but
the
alternate,
a
1292(b)
certification.
why
didn't
you
even
try
that
as
a
fallback
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
but
sometimes
lawyers
say
but
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
then
here's
my
backup
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
firm
final
judgment
rule
is
also
important
in
the
federal
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
narrowly
final
decision
means
that
the
district
court
has
disassociated
itself
from
the
case.
that
is
the
ordinary
meaning
of
it.
the
meaning
in
cohen
v.
beneficial
is
different.
it's
not
that
meaning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
cohen
v.
beneficial
is
something
made
up
by
the
courts,
is
it
not?
i
mean,
the
statute
says,
final
decision.
you
agree
that
final
decision
generally
means
the
district
court
is
finished,
washes...
it's
done.
this
case
is
over,
it
goes
to
the
next
stage.
the
courts
in
cohen
v.
beneficial
gave
that
a
different
meaning,
so
you
can't
really
attribute
that
to
the
legislature.
cohen
v.
beneficial
is
a
judicially
created
doctrine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--just
as
in
lauro,
then
finally...
and
it
was
over
and
done
with,
they
lost
their
right
to
be
sued
in
one
tribunal
and
in
no
other.
that
was
their
deal.
we
will...
we
select
this
forum,
and
we
exclude
all
others.
they
could
never
get
back
to
that
situation,
once
there
was
no
interlocutory
appeal
of
the
rejection...
of
the
objection
to
the
forum
that
was
chosen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
in
the
case
of
claim
preclusion,
we
have
a
right
not
to
have
this
matter
litigated.
it's
been
litigated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
anything
else
on
the
60(b)
list
that
you
would
put
in
this
category?
that
is,
you
have
a
judgment.
this
judgment
has
been
reopened
by
the
district
court.
is
there
anything
else
where
60(b)
would
be
used
to
reopen
a
judgment
where
you
couldn't...
if
you
get
an
adverse
ruling
in
the
district
court
you
could
go
under
cohen
v.
beneficial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
first
one,
that
it
conclusively
determined
that
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--settlement
is
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
the
district
court
put
it
in
terms,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
of
could
find
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts
says
there's
nothing
else
like
settlement,
that
settlement
is
a
class
by
itself.
there's
nothing
else
on
the
60(b)
list,
i
take
it
nothing
else
on
the
8(c)
affirmative
defense
list
that
would
qualify.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
district
court
found
the
court
didn't
fraud
didn't
infect
the
settlement,
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
the
settlement
would
hold.
so
it's
only
if
the
district
court
finds--
you
said
that
you
didn't
make
the
separateness
argument
because
you
thought
your
other
arguments
were
stronger,
but
that
is
an
argument
that
this
court
could
look
into
because
this
is
a
jurisdictional
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what...
mr.
roberts
insists
that
the
merits
are
not
bound
up
with
this
question,
and
can
you
tell
us
as
concisely
as
you
can
why
you
think
that
this
appeal
fails
the
separateness
test
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
basis
on
which
the
settlement
agreement
was
set
aside?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
its
decision
was
fraud
related,
even
if
it
didn't
find
fraud.
its
decision
to
set
aside
the
settlement
was
fraud
related.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
said
that
a
factfinder
could
find
fraud.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
its
decision
is
related
to
the
notion
of
fraud.
