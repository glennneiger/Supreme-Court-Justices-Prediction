mr.
arden
j.
lea
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
this
honorable
court,
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
mcdermott,
incorporated,
is
here
today
to
obtain
relief
from
the
double
penalty
placed
upon
it
by
the
fifth
circuit,
which
left
in
place
a
trial
judge's
reduction
of
its
judgment,
pursuant
to
the
proportionate
fault
rule;
which,
at
the
same
time,
it
rejected
and,
then,
from
that
reduced
amount,
compounded
injustice
by
further
deducting
from
the
judgment
the
full
dollar
amount
of
a
settlement
with
another
codefendant...
to
the
detriment,
obviously,
of
the
injured
plaintiff,
mcdermott.
encapsulated
in
these
facts,
which,
on
their
own,
would
require
reversal,
is
a
disputed
issue
of
admiralty
law
requiring
resolution
by
this
court...
namely,
which
rule
on
settlement
contribution
should
be
adopted
by
the
court:
the
proportionate
fault
rule
or
the
pro
tanto
rule?
interestingly,
all
parties
agree
that
three
fundamental
principles
surrounding
the
resolution
of
this
issue...
which
are,
initially,
all
agree
that
the
principle
of
joint
and
several
liability
is,
and
should
continue
to
be,
the
rule
of
this
court.
all
agree
that
liability
among
co-tort
phases
is
and
should
continue
to
be
determined
proportionately
at
trial
and,
also,
in
any
contribution
action.
all
agree
that
settlement
should
be
encouraged,
but
not
at
the
expense
of
the
two
preceding
principles;
nor
at
the
expense
of
needlessly
altering
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
the
remain...
of
the
non-settling
defendant
in
the
proceeding
at
trial
that
will
later
follow.
the
disputed
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
adoption
of
the
proportionate
or
the
dollar-for-dollar
settlement...
so-called
tanto...
pro-tanto
contribution
rule...
will
best
effectuate
these
fundamental
principles
mentioned
above,
and
which
should
be
incorporated
by
this
court
into
admiralty
law.
the
court
today
has
to
accommodate
its
historical
favoring
of
settlement
of
claims
entered
into
by
the
injured
plaintiff,
and
the
need
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
non-settling
defendant,
who
is
not
a
party
to
the
settlement
agreement.
mcdermott
urges
this
court
to
hold
that
the
proportionate
settlement
contribution
rule
is
the
faires
and,
thus,
the
best.
the
plaintiff
is
permitted,
under
this
rule,
to
become...
to
remain
a
master
of
its
own
destiny
with
regard
to
its
claim.
he
can
choose,
with
consultation
of
counsel,
which
method
best
serves
the
resolution
of
the
claim
that
is
his
anyway.
he,
by
settling,
accepts
both
the
benefits
and
the
detriment
of
the
contract,
as
is
the
case
with
respect
to
any
contract.
on
the
other
hand,
most
importantly,
the
non-settle...
settling
defendant's
contribution
rights
remain
unaltered
because,
at
trial,
they
will
be
decided
proportionately.
now,
there
are
certain
alleged
perceived
benefits
to
the
adoption
of
the
pro
tanto
rule.
but
mcdermott
suggests
to
this
court
that
in
all--
mr.
arden
j.
lea
--proportionate
fault
rule,
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
which
was
basically
the
rule
of
comparative
fault
that
was
outlined
by
this
court
by
its
adoption
of
that
in
non-collision
cases
in
reliance
transfer,
and
which
has
been
the
rule
of
this
case
with
regard
to
personal
injury
since
the
country
has
existed.
the
alleged
benefits
of
the
pro
tanto,
or
the
dollar-for-dollar
credit,
usually
advanced
to
justify
its
adoption,
can...
are
usually
couched
in
terms
of:
it
ensures
full
compensation
to
the
plaintiff;
it's
easy
to
apply;
the
dollar-for-dollar
credit
satisfies
the
one
satisfaction
rule;
and
that
it
avoids
potentially
confusing
or
unnatural
realignments
of
the
parties
at
trial.
mcdermott
contends
that
these
benefits
are
merely
perceived
and,
when
examined
carefully,
do
not
result
in
the
benefits
advocated
by
proponents
of
the
pro
tanto
rule:
initially,
full
compensation
to
the
plaintiff.
if
you
really
think
about
that,
that
presupposes
liability
on
the
non-settling
defendant.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
full
compensation
to
the
plaintiff.
it
also
wrongfully
equates,
as
the
leger
opinion
pointed
out,
settlement
dollars
were
judgment
dollars.
and
the
way
they
are
determined...
or
the
amount
is
determined
that
is
fair...
are
subject
to
completely
different
rules...
one
are
personal
concerns
of
the
parties
to
the
settlement.
things
like,
in
a
corporation,
not
tying
up
key
employees
by
the
time
necessarily
consumed
in
defending
any...
or
prosecuting
any
trial.
another
thing
that
would
be
considered
would
be
litigation
expenses,
which,
as
everyone
is
quite
aware,
are
costly
these
days.
the
judgment
dollars
are
merely
what
the
trier
of
fact,
be
it
a
judge
or
a
jury,
think,
after
a
hearing
of
the
evidence,
the
case
is
worth...
no
more,
no
less.
this
court
has
favored,
in
recent
years,
the
settlement
of
cases
without
resort
to
extra
judicial
means...
with
its
favoring
of
the
arbitration
proceedings,
for
instance.
we
see
no
reason
why
private,
out-of-court
settlements
that
do
not
affect
the
rights
of
anyone
other
than
the
parties
to
the
agreement,
as
occurs
in
the
proportionate
method
that
we
advocate,
should
really
be
of
concern
to
the
court,
other
than
to
encourage
the
fact
that
they
be
entered
into.
there's
no--
mr.
arden
j.
lea
--your
honor,
that's
precisely
what
does
not
happen
in
the
proportionate
method,
because,
in
the
proportionate
method
that
we're
advocating,
what
happens
is
that
the
jury,
in
the
trial
of
the
non-settling
defendant,
is
charged
to
render
a
verdict
relating
only
to
the
percentage
of
fault
that
the
defendant
decides...
who
decides
to
go
to
trial
contributed
to
the
ultimate--
mr.
arden
j.
lea
--yes,
ma'am,
it
would.
it
would,
your
honor.
and
there
is
nothing
really
wrong
with
that,
though,
because
if
you
really
think
about
it,
the...
if...
if
you
looked
at
it
in...
in
the
practical
matter
of
how
a
case
is
tried,
really,
all
the
books
written
on
it,
there
are
only...
almost
all
defendants...
and
i'm
usually
one
myself...
come
with
the
same
thing:
first,
they
say
the
accident
didn't
happen
or
the
damages
weren't
incurred
by
the
plaintiff.
but,
if
it
did,
it
was
the
fault
of
a...
fault
of
a
third
party,
either
a
party
before
the
court,
one
that
can't...
the
court
can't
exercise
jurisdiction
over,
or
the
fault
of
the
plaintiff.
and
then,
if
it
loses
there,
it
will
usually
back
it
up.
but
if...
but
if
you
find
it's
my
fault,
i
only
caused
a
little
bit.
and--
mr.
arden
j.
lea
--and
anything
else
that
can
be
thrown
into
the
hopper,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
i
don't
often
have
that
benefit,
your
honor.
now,
with
regard
to
ease
of
application
and
judicial
economy,
i
think
this
court
clearly,
in
reliable
transfer,
held
that
if
this
is
to
be
sacrificed...
if...
if
equity
is
to
be
sacrificed
to
achieve
this,
that
this
court
will
not
tolerate
it.
and
it--
mr.
arden
j.
lea
--it
is,
your
honor.
it
is,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
wrong
with
holding
a
plaintiff
to
a
settlement
that
he
was
satisfied
with
at
the
time
he
made
it.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
it
is
not
that
common.
i
think
what
you
are
referring
to
would
be
very
closely
akin
to
what's
referred
to
commonly
as
a
mary
carter
agreement.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
a
mary
carter
agreement,
so
named--
mr.
arden
j.
lea
--in
my
experience,
that
is
not
common.
and,
if
it
is,
most
trial
judges,
as
with
any
evidentiary
matter,
usually
hold
that
that
is
relevant
information
that
should
be
put
before
the
jury
in
order
to
any...
to
end
any
faults
or
hidden
misalignment
of
parties.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
it
is.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
as
in
any
contract,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
why
a
settlement
contract,
absent
fraud
or
misrepresentation,
should
be
treated
under
the
law
by
this
court
any
different
than
any
other
contract.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
no,
sir.
we
wouldn't
agree
with
that.
and
the
reason
why
is
that
we
don't
think
that
the
non-settling
defendant
has
standing
to
challenge
a
contract
that
does
not
affect
him.
because
no
matter
what
happens
at
the
ultimate
trial,
that
defendant
will
only
have
to
pay
the
amount
that
the
trier
of
fact,
albeit
judge
or
jury,
finds
that
he,
in
right,
should
pay.
another
thing
that
it
does
is
it
deters
the
non-settling
defendant's
conduct.
and...
and...
and...
and
why
should
he
be
allowed
to
challenge
a
contract
when
it
doesn't
affect
him?
and
if
the
plaintiff
gets
more,
the
person
that
really
should
complain
would
be
the
settling
defendant,
but
he
was
satisfied
with
the
contract,
or
otherwise
he
wouldn't
have
entered
into
it.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
i
would
say,
in
my
experience,
that
usually
a
plaintiff
will
discount
in
exchange
for
a
certainty
of
recovery
in
acceptance
of
a
settlement
of
a
lesser
amount
than
he
would
anticipate
getting
at
trial.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
he
would,
but
he
would
have
the
stability
and
the
certainty
of
receiving
a
sum
certain
in
exchange
for
gambling
and
going
to
trial--
mr.
arden
j.
lea
--which
is
usually
what
happens
in
any
contract.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
he
did.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
exactly.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
well,
only
if
you
equate
settlement
dollars
with
judgment
dollars,
your
honor,
as
i
mentioned
earlier.
and
all
we're
asking
the
non-settling
defendant
to
do
is
pay
the
amount
that
the
jury
determines
he
rightfully
owes
after
a
full
trial
on
the
merits.
the
problem
with
the
pro
tanto
method,
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
you,
is
we
think
it
borders
on
being
seriously...
having
serious
constitutional
infirmities,
because,
otherwise,
under
that
system,
you
are
taking
a
defendant's
right
to
have
contribution
decided
on
a
proportional
basis,
which
we're
advocating
here.
and,
as
a
corollary
to
this,
we
see
no
reason
to
have
one
rule
at
trial
and
another
rule
at
settlement.
you
are
taking
his
constitutional
right...
or
his
right
to
have
a
full
trial
on
his
right
of
contribution
by...
against
another
defendant,
and
you
are
letting
parties,
by
private
agreement,
to
which
he
is
not
a
part,
set
those
rights,
with
either
no
right
of
contribution
or,
under
the
so-called
fairness
hearing...
which
we
think
is
a
misnomer,
because
there
is
nothing
fair
about
substituting
a
hearing
against
a
nonparticipating
defendant
for
his
right
to
trial...
which
is
oftentimes
to
be
held
before
a
jury,
as
was
in
this
case...
and
have
it
determined
by
private
agreement
and
foisted
on
him
in
the
name
of
fairness...
because
this
really
is
not
fair
to
anyone.
the
court's
review
in
these
so-called
fairness
hearing
are
much
akin
to
the
review
you
would
give
if
you
were
buying
a
200...
$200
used
car...
you
kick
the
tires
and
you
take
off.
or,
as
the
california
court
said,
you
make
sure
that
the
settlement
is
in
the
ball
park.
in
effect,
they
were
issuing
a
summary
judgment
on
this
basis
against
a
party
that
never
really
had
a
right
to
present
his
case
at
a
full
trial...
and
depriving
him
of
his
right
to
his
possessions,
thereby,
under
the
guise...
that's
what
the
state
is
ordering
him
to
do.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
my
answer
is,
under
the...
the
proportionate
method,
there
is
no
contribution,
because
there
is
no
necessity
there
for,
because
the
trier
of
fact
has
determ--
mr.
arden
j.
lea
--it
would
be,
but
in
any
proceed...
judicial
efficiency--
mr.
arden
j.
lea
--you're
correct.
yes,
sir.
your
honor
is
correct.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arden
j.
lea
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
that
i
see...
that
seems
to
be
of
interest...
most
interest
to
the
court,
and
that
is,
is
the
plaintiff
purportedly
getting
a
windfall?
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
case,
we
did
not
get
a
windfall,
because
the
sling
defendants
had
exposure
in
$4.5
million
worth
of
damages
that
were
dismissed
in
exchange
for
their
million-dollar
settlement,
as
well
as
this
case.
we
could
have
pursued
with
no
east
river
bar
the
claim
against
them
for
the
damage
to
the
shearleg
crane.
next
of
all,
i
want
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
are
oftentimes,
because
we
love
the
law,
because
we
are
in
it
every
day,
tend
to
view
the
law
as
we
would
view
a
child,
but
we
have
to
realize
that
the
law,
no
more
than
our
children,
are
perfect.
and
to
say
that
a
plaintiff
gets
a
windfall
presupposes
that
the
true
value
or
worth
of
a
case
is
that
set
by
the
judicial
system,
the
trier
of
fact,
be
it
judge
or
jury,
and
that
the
private
parties
to
the
agreement,
are...
who
are
intimately
familiar
with
its
detail,
are
incapable
of
placing
an
accurate
or
a
judicially
approved
value
on
the
case.
thank
you
much
for
your
attention.
