hear
argument
first
this
morning
in

inc.,
v.
amclyde
and
river
don
castings
limited.
mr.
lea.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lea,
you...
you
refer
to
the...
the
rule
your
espousing,
i
believe,
you're
referring
to
as
the
proportionate
fault
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
in
any
event,
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lea.
mr.
kelley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
mr.
kelley,
we've
heard
that,
i
believe,
described
as
pro...
pro...
proportionate
fault
rule.
and
what
you're
advocating
is
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
as
opposed
to
pro
tanto?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kelley.
mr.
couhig,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
speak
of
allegiances,
are
you
speaking
of
allegiances
of
witnesses
to...
to
your
cause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
like
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
surely,
we
don't
have
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--drastically
alter
a
basic
rule
in
order
to
see
that
witnesses--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
okay.
that's
a
problem
you
agree
can
be
alleviated
without
any...
any
shifting
of
rules.
what
are
the
other
problems?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
mean
the...
the...
you've
talked
about
all
the
practical
problems
that
arise
when
the
settlement
is
announced
on
the
morning
of
trial.
are
there
any,
other
than
the...
what
you
refer
to
as
the
allegiance
of
witnesses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
couhig,
we've
been
told
by
other
counsel
that
perhaps
there
were
two,
possible
three,
different
rules
that
could
govern
this.
is
this
one
of
the
three
rules,
or
one
of
the
two
rules,
or
is
it,
you
know,
kind
of
a
new
proposal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
which
has
not
heretofore
commended
itself
to
any
other
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would...
would
you
identify
them
and
us,
because
there's
so
many
parties
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you...
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
couhig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lea,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lea.
the
case
is
submitted.
