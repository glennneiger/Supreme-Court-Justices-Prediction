justice

paul
stevens
but
isn't...
you
know,
isn't
that
one
reason,
counsel,
while
a
plaintiff
will
often
discount
the
value
of
his
claim
against
the
first
settling
defendant,
because,
a,
he
has
less
adversaries
in
the
courtroom,
and,
b,
he's
got
a
little
money
to
play
with
to
finance
the
rest
of
the
litigation,
so
you
often
will
get
a...
a
discounted
settlement
from
the
first
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
but
under
the
pro
rata,
if
you
assume
the...
the
first
settler
is
30
percent
responsible
or
something
like
that,
the
non-settling
defendant
gets
the
benefit
of
having
30
percent
of
his
potential
liability
chopped
off
right
at
the
outset.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
gets
the
benefit
of
the
discounted
settlement,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
one
of
the
risks
of
the
whole
pro...
process.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
your
policy
is
to
encourage
settlements
as
much
as
possible,
what's
wrong
with
saying
a
non-settling
defendant
should
bear
that
risk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the...
the
principle
victim
of
the...
not
getting
full
recovery
is
the
plaintiff.
and
he
made
the
deal.
he...
he
accepted
less
for
tactical
reasons,
in
part,
as
well
as
for
economic
reasons.
and
so
he
gets
less
than
a
full
recovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
don't
you
think
the
settlement
in
this
case
is...
is
atypical?
normally,
the
first
settler
will
pay
less
than
the...
than
the...
the
probable
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct,
just
so
i
get
the
figure,
that
if
there
had
been
no
settlement
at
all,
it
would
have
paid
798,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if...
if
the
various
factors
that
affect
the
judgment
are
just
taken
out
of
the
picture,
that...
that's
the
figure
they
would
have
paid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
in
your
suggestion...
the
same
amount
of
trial...
when
you
put
in
the
case
against
the
settling
defendant,
to...
to
enlarge
that
percent...
his
percentage
of
liability,
one
of
the
advantages
is
the
settling
defendant
won't
care,
so
he
won't
resist
that
case.
so
your
case
is
a
little
easier
on
that...
that
phase
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
complication,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
some
of
these
settlements
are
not
just
simply
for
dollars.
like
in
this
case,
the
million
dollars
might
possibly
have
been
accompanied
by
agreement
for
the
next
five
years
we'll
buy
our
slings
from
your
company,
or
something
like
that,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
makes
it
kind
of
hard
to
measure
the
dollars
sometimes.
