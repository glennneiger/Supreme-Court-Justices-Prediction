justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
you're
saying
is
whether
they
do
that
or
whether
they
don't,
they
are...
they're
still
adjusting
their
rights
and
liabilities
by
agreement,
and
nobody
has
to
weep
if
they
get
it
wrong...
they're...
they're
both
over
21?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
your...
your
answer
assumes
there's
no
contribution
against
him.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
the...
in
the...
in
the...
the
horrible
example
you
just
gave,
the
solution
to
the
horrible
example
could
be
simply
to
allow
contribution
against
the
settling
defendant.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
grant
you
that.
but
that's...
that's
there's
a
price
to
pay
for
the
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
when...
when
you
say,
we
cannot
equate
judgment
and
settlement
dollars,
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
the...
the
parties
place
their
own
value
on
them.
isn't...
isn't
that
another
way
of,
in
effect,
saying,
it's
their
agreement
and
therefore
no
one
has
cause
to
complain
if
he
happens,
ultimately,
to
end
up
on
the
short
end
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
it?
because,
i
mean,
you've
still
got
parties
with...
with
an
interest
in
bringing
in,
as
it
were,
the...
the
two
sides
of
the
question.
the
defendants
are
going
to
try
to
get
in
one
set
of
evidence.
the
plaintiff...
he's
going
to
try
to
get
in
another.
so,
it's
true,
you
don't
have
one
defendant
there,
but
it's
likely
that
you've
got
two
parties...
two
sets
of
parties
with
the
same
interest
to
get
the
evidence
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
that's
true.
it...
it
puts
the
plaintiff
in
a
difficult
position,
but
the
plaintiff
asked
for
it.
the
plaintiff
agreed.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
is
that
realistic?
sure,
he's
concerned
with
his
own
responsibility,
but
he
wants
to
make
sure
that
the
fact-finder
thinks
that
most
of
that
responsibility,
whatever
it
may...
or
most
of
the
responsibility...
rested
on
the
head
of
another
defendant.
his...
his...
his
interest
doesn't
change.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's...
it's
correct
to
say
that
if...
if
your
case
is
decided
on
the
pro
rata
method,
your
client
cannot
be
required
to
pay
more
than
your
client's
share
of
the
proportionate
fault?
it's
quite
true
your
client
doesn't
get
the
benefit
of
the
million
dollars,
but
your
client
is
not
going
to
have
to
pay
a
penny
more
than
the
fault
which
is
attributable
to
your
client
in
relation
to
the
total
damages;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's...
that's...
that's
a
separate
problem.
and
i
mean
that...
what...
whatever
the...
whatever
the
merits
of
that
argument
may
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
doesn't
go
to
the...
to
the
question
of
whether...
the...
the
broad
question,
whether...
whether
we
should
choose
pro
rata
or...
or
pro
tanto?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
that
particular
point
that
you
raise
is
not
what
we've...
what
we've
taken
cert
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
grant...
i
grant
you
that.
but
the...
the
point...
excuse
me...
the
point
of
my
question
was
simply
that
you
have
been
using
the
word,
unfairness,
from
time
to
time,
and
whatever
that
term
may
mean,
it
does
not
mean,
under
the
pro
rata
method,
that
a
non-settling
defendant
would
be
required
to
pay
any
more
than
the
non-settling
defendant's
share
of
the
responsibility
for
the
total
damage.
that's...
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
carry
that
argument
to
extremes,
you
say
any...
any
defendant
who
pays
too
much
in
a
settlement
ought
to
be
able
to
challenge
the
settlement
afterwards,
because
the
point
of
the
lawsuit
was
simply
to
make
the
plaintiff
whole.
i
mean,
if
that's...
if
that's
relevant
in
a...
in
a
situation
in
which
two
parties
adjust
their
differences
by
agreement,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
proves
too
much.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
simply...
which
is
simply
to
say
that
a
total
recovery
which
does
not
go
above
damages
is
not
an
absolute
requirement
of
the
system
under...
under...
under
anybody's
view,
including
yours?
that's
not
an
absolute
value.
because,
of
course,
you
would
let
the...
the...
the
plaintiff
who
gets
a
very
good
deal
in
a
settlement
keep
the...
keep
the
excess.
and...
and...
and
if...
if
you
will
allow
the
plaintiff
to
keep
the
excess
in
his
relationship
with
the
settling
defendant
and
you
don't
require
the
non-settling
defendants
to
pay
any
more
than
their
proportional
share,
then
i'm
not
sure
how
the...
the
value
of...
of...
of
limiting
recovery
to
damage
is...
is
a
relevant
factor
in...
in
the
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
settling
defendant
would
be
firing
his
lawyer,
i
presume,
and
bringing
a
lawsuit.
[laughter]
but
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
that
that
should
influence
our
decision
on
the
methodology.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
isn't
the
problem
with
that
answer
that
there
is
no
excess
as
between
the
non-settling
defendant
and
the
plaintiff;
the
non-settling
defendant
is
paying
just
what
the
non-settling
defendant
has
caused
for
harm?
justice
david
h.
souter
look,
i'll...
i'll
grant
you
that.
let's...
let's
assume
that
we've
got
a
choice
here.
you
can
say,
well,
it's
unfair
to
the
non-settling
defendants
because
they
are
being
required
to
pay
money
to...
to
fill
a
pocket
which
is
not
as
empty
as...
as
the...
as
the
court
and
the
plaintiff,
in
effect,
says.
or
you
could
say
there
is...
there
is
a
certain
unfairness
to
the
settling
defendant,
who
obviously
did
not
settle
very
prudently.
let's...
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
there
is
a
draw
to
be
called
here...
but
let's
assume
we
call
it
a
draw,
and
we
say,
got
some
unfairness
on...
on
either
side.
we
get
a
simpler
system
to
administer
if
we...
if
we
follow
the
method
that...
that
has
been
labelled
the...
the
proportionate
fault
or...
or
the
pro
rata
method,
haven't
we,
because,
under
that
method
the
case
is
over,
and
under
your
method
the
case
is
not
over?
because
you're
either
going
to
have
a...
a
good
faith
hearing
or
you're
going
to
have
a
contribution
hearing.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
that's
a...
that's...
that's
a
wash...
on
either
analysis,
that's
a
wash.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
there
is...
there
is
a...
there
is
a
savings...
there
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--with
respect,
my...
my...
my
suggestion
is
there
is
a
savings
of
a...
a
hearing
on
the
collateral
issue,
either
a
contribution
issue
or
a...
or
a
good
faith
settlement
issue.
i'm
not
saying
there's
a
savings
in
trial.
there
may
or
may
not
be.
i...
i
can't
predict
it.
and
i
assume
there
is
not.
but
there
will
be
a
savings
on...
on...
on
collateral.
and...
and
in
your
brief,
you
downplayed...
it
seemed
to
me,
you
downplayed
the...
the...
the
potential
complication
of
the
collateral
hearing.
you
spoke,
for
example,
i
think
it
was
in
your
brief
that
you
spoke
of
the...
you
know,
the
good
faith
hearing
as
something
that
can
be
decided
on
documents.
well,
i
don't
see
that
at
all.
people
aren't
going
to
leave
documents
lying
around
attesting
to
bad
faith.
and
i...
i
mean,
i
think
we've
got
to
accept
the
fact
that
if
we
choose
a
system
which
is
going
to
function
perfectly,
as
it
were,
because
we're
going
to
allow
a
good
faith
hearing,
we...
we're...
we're
going
to
have
some
messy
collateral
hearing.
