mr.
william
k.
kelley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
which
arises
under
the
general
maritime
law,
the
court
has
the
task
of
arriving
at
what
it
considers
the
best
rule
under
the
circumstances,
without
the
backdrop
of
any
statutory
provisions
or
policies
to
turn
to
for
guidance.
and,
in
this
context,
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
proportional
reduction,
or
pro
rata
rule,
is
the
appropriate
one
to
adopt.
that
rule
is
fair
because
it
leads
to
all
the
parties
in
the
lawsuit--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--in
substance,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
our
brief
we've
used
the
term
pro
rata,
which,
perhaps,
was
imprecise.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
yes.
the
commentators
view
it...
view
there...
there
as
being
three
different
options:
a
pro
tanto,
a
pro
rata
and
a
proportional
reduction.
the
pure
pro
rata
approach,
which
allocates
the
settlement
based
on
simply
the
number
of
people
in
the
lawsuit,
is
not
favored
by
anyone.
so
our
brief
probably
should
have
used
the
term
proportional
reduction
instead.
but,
in
any
event,
the
substance
in
the
same.
and
the
substance
of
that
rule
is...
is
one
that
leaves
the
burdens
of
a
party's
decision
to
settle
or
not
to
settle
a
case
on
that
party.
we
think
it's,
therefore,
fair.
it's
also
efficient
because
it
obviates
the
need
for
any
collateral
litigation,
whether
in
the
form
of
contribution
or
a
fairness
hearing.
now,
the
primary
objection
to
the
proportional
reduction
rule
made
by
respondents
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
justice
scalia
this
morning,
is
that
it
threatens
to
violate
the
so-called
one
recovery
rule:
a
tort
plaintiff
is
entitled
only
to
recover
the
amount
of
damages
determined
by
the
jury,
and
no
more.
and
the
pro
tanto
rule
does
assure
that
that
will
be
the
case.
but
we
think
that
objection
is
without
any
merit
for
the
following
reasons:
first,
it
wrongfully
equates
settlement
dollars
with
judgment
dollars.
it's
quite
clear
as
an
economic
matter,
it
seems
to
us,
that
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant,
when
considering
whether
to
settle,
will
consider
a
variety
of
factors,
not
necessarily
exclusively
the
value
of
the
claim
if
it
goes
to
trial,
in
determining
whether
to
settle,
and
the
appropriate
amount
at
which
to
settle.
those
factors
include
the
cost--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--i...
i
agree
with
that,
justice
souter.
the
point
is
that,
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
sling
defendants
made
a
$1
million
settlement,
which
turns
out,
in
retrospect,
to
appear
to
have
been
a
bad
bargain
for
them.
but
we
don't
know,
prior
to
trial,
whether
that
was
so,
because
they
could
have
considered
a
variety
of
factors,
in
addition
to
the
value
of
the
claim
if
it
goes
to
trial,
in
deciding
what
amount
to
pay,
including
the
cost
of
litigating
and
the...
the...
not
only
the
economic
costs,
in
terms
of
legal
fees,
et
cetera,
but
also
the
distraction
to
the
company.
so
it
might
well
have
been
very
worthwhile
for
them
to
pay
more
than
they
might
have
lost
at
judgment.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
we
think
that
argument
is...
is
incorrect,
justice
ginsburg,
because
what
it
does
is
it
requires
the
plaintiff
to
transfer
the
benefit
of
his
good
settlement
bargain
to
the
non-settling
defendant.
and
that
results
in
nothing
but
a
windfall
to
that
defendant...
as
happened
in
this
case
under
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
the
plaintiff
has
not
achieved
a
double
recovery
in
this
case,
because
the
settlement
that
he
received
was
not
part
of
the
judgment.
it
is
true
that
the
jury...
the
jury's
determination
of
damages
turned
out
to
make
it
appear
that
way,
but
prior
to
the...
prior
to
trial,
the
plaintiff
took
a
risk
that
the
settlement
would
be
a
bad
deal
for
the
plaintiff.
and
we
don't
see
any
basis
for
undoing
that
bargain.
and...
and--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--justice
scalia,
i
disagree.
and
the
reason
is...
is
this.
the
20
percent...
or
80
percent...
excuse
me...
that
the
plaintiff
received
before
trial
did
not
represent
his
injury.
in
part,
it
surely
did
represent
his
injury,
but
it
also
represented
additional
economic
considerations
made
by
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
who
settled
with
him.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
rule
you're
suggesting...
it's
not
only
unfair
to
the
plaintiff,
but
it's
inefficient
in
terms
of
the
way
the
tort
system
should
operate.
because
what
it
does
is
it
rewards
a
defendant
for
not
settling.
it
makes
his
ultimate
payment
not
in
accord
with
the
damage
he
caused
in
maritime
commerce.
and
this
court
has
consistently,
for
over
a
century,
held
to
the
notion
that
rules
of
liability
in...
in...
in
maritime
courts
should
be
calibrated
to
encourage
parties
to
take
appropriate
levels
of
care
in
maritime
commerce.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
i...
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
the
rule
that...
that
we
are
advocating.
the...
the
pro
tanto
rule
has
disincentives
to
settle
built
into
it.
in...
among
them
are...
are
the
possibilities
of
collateral
litigation,
which
inevitably
will
occur
either
in
the
form
of
contribution
or
a
fairness
hearing.
there's
no...
there
should
be
no
disincentive
to
settle
under
the
proportional
reduction
rule
that
we're
considering,
because
a
defendant
knows
that
he
will
only
be
held
at
trial
if
he
fails
to
settle
for
his
proportionate
share
of
the
damages.
we
think
that
is...
is
the
proper
principle.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
settlement
allocation
rule
deviates
from
that
principle
and
coerces
a
defendant
to
settle,
we
think
that
is
an
illegitimate
coercion.
the
court
recognized
as
much
in
the
reliable
transfer,
where
it
said
that
a
rule
that
merely
encourages
settlements
is
no
rule
at
all
if
it
is
unfair.
so,
we...
we
believe
that
it's...
it's
hard
to
say
for
certain
in
the
abstract
which
rule
would...
would
encourage
settlements
to
a
greater
degree,
but
we
don't
believe
there's
any
basis
for
saying
the
rule
we
advocate
would
discourage
settlements
at
all.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
there...
there
is
a
variant
of
the
rule,
which
is
the
pro
tanto
rule.
that's...
that's
what
justice--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--well,
i...
i
don't--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--well,
a...
a
couple
of
states...
texas,
i
believe,
and
perhaps
new
york...
have
adopted
systems
that
give
the
non-settling...
that
defendant
the
option
of
choosing
which
system
he
wants.
we
think
that
is...
would
needlessly
complicate
litigation.
and
we...
we
believe
also
that
it...
it
unduly
and
unfairly
gives
the
non-settling
defendant
the
option
to...
to
minimize
his
own
out-of-pocket
payments
in
a
manner
than
is
inefficient
in
terms
of
the
tort
system.
the
rule
we're
advocating
is
one
that
treats
each
party
as...
as
a
party
that's
able
to
make
its
own
deals,
and
should
be
required
to
live
with
the
burdens
and
benefits
of
that
deal.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
because
what
it
does,
justice
ginsburg,
is
it
makes
a
defendant's
liability
payment
to
a
plaintiff
depend
on
a
factor
other
than
its
level
of
care
in...
in
the
maritime
marketplace.
and
it's
clear,
under
this
court's
cases,
that
rules
of
tort
liability
should
be
calibrated
best
to
induce
appropriate
levels
of
care
on...
on
all
sides.
and
in
this
case,
for
example,
river
don,
the
respondent
is
going
to
be...
if...
if
it
prevails...
is
going
to
pay
less
dollars
to
the
plaintiff
than
the
damage
he
causes
the
plaintiff.
we
think
that
under-deters,
and
we
think
it's
inefficient
in
terms
of
the
tort
system's
goals.
and
it's
not
unfair--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--no,
no,
no,
justice
scalia--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--it...
it
does
in
the
following
sense.
if
there's
a
chance
that
you
can
gain
such
an
advantage
in
litigation,
there
might
be
an
incentive
not
to
take
appropriate
levels
of
care.
so
the
point
is
really
the
converse
of
what
you're
suggesting.
if
your
liability
is
predictable,
then
you
will
take
appropriate
levels
of
care.
so
the
fact
that
his
liability
might...
might
well
be
lower
because
of
what
happens
in
litigation
is...
is
something
that
the...
the
tort
system
does
not
desire.
and
it...
and
it...
and
it's
not
something
the
court
should
foster.
what
the
court
should
do
is
make
defendants
pay
damages
according
to
the
harm
they
cause.
and
that
is
the
theory
that
leads
to
efficient
conduct
in
the
marketplace.
and
i've
just
emphasized
that
the
pro
tanto
rule
results
in
a
windfall
either
to
the
plaintiff
or
to...
or
to
the
non-settling
defendant.
in
this
case
it
would
be.
i
thank
the
court.
