which
rule
would
encourage
more
settlements,
the
rule
that
you
just...
that
you
are
advocating
or
the
rule
suggested
by
justice
scalia's
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
if
you
did
that,
then
the
settling
defendant
would
never
know
whether
that
was
the
end
of
the...
the
line
for
him
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
you
just
shift
the
unfairness.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i
don't
understand.
if...
if
the
defendant
that
goes
to
trial
has
the
option
at
that
stage
of
selecting
the
method,
and
if
it's
in
a
jurisdiction
that
allows
recovery,
as
in
the
boca
grande
case,
to
follow
from
the
settling
defendant,
then
i
would
think
that
the
defendant
who
settled
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
deal
was
going
to
stand
or
not
stand,
as
it
was.

counsel,
by
pro
rata,
you
mean
proportionate?
