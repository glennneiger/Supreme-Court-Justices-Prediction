justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what...
what
about,
counsel,
the
unseemliness
of,
if
you
go
with
the
proportionate
fault
way,
the
settling
defendant
determining
that
defendant's
portion
of
the
liability
when
that...
that
person
is
a
nonparty
to
the
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would...
wouldn't
necessarily
the
jury
have
to
determine
if
it's
proportioning
the
fault,
what
is
the
respective
fault
of
the
settling
defendant
and
the
non-settling
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
case
unusual
in
that
respect,
that
the
settling
defendant
paid
more
than
what
turned
out
to
be
the
proportionate
share?
isn't
more
common
that
the
settling
defendant
pays
less?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
would
end
up
short?
the
plaintiff
would
get
less
than
the
full
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kelley,
what's
wrong
with
the
solution
that
justice
scalia
referred
to
earlier,
that
one
thing
they
shouldn't
have
is
that
the
plaintiff
gets
over
100
percent
recovery,
so
that
when
the
settlement
is...
turns
out
to
be
too
high,
that
the
non-settling
defendant
should
not
have
to
pay
more
than
what
would
be
enough
to
give
the
plaintiff
a
hundred
percent
of
what
the
jury
finds
to
be
the
total
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
rule
like
the
one
that
justice
scalia
suggested...
and
outlining...
and
all
the
briefs
outlined
the
three
different
positions
that
courts
take...
and
the
position
that
you're
advocating
is
essentially
you
don't
look
at
the
settlement,
the
settlement
doesn't
count,
whether
it's
high,
whether
it's
low,
it's
out
of
it
under
the...
what
you
call
the
proportionate
fault
system...
is
there
any
variant
of...
of
these
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean...
not
the
pro
tanto
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
a
rule
that
says,
you
don't
look
at
the
settlement
when
it's
too
low,
but
you
do
when
it's
too
high.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
inefficient
in
terms
of
the
tort
system?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
your
system,
the
one...
the
election
system,
the
non-settling
defendant
elects
between
proportionate
fault
and
pro
tanto...
that
that
would
wipe
out
any
suggestion
of
a
right
of
contribution?
