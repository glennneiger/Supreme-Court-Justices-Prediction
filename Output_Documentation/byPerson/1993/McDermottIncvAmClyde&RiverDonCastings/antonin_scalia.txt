justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
joined
the
government
you
could
plead
sovereign
immunity,
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it's
not
unfair
to
the...
to
the
plaintiff
or
to
the
settling
defendant,
but...
but
is
there
not...
and
it
seems
to
me
this
the
problem...
the
non-settling
defendant
is
hauled
into
court
in
order
to
pay
the
plaintiff,
by
the
power
of
government,
more...
more
than
the
plaintiff
has
actually
suffered.
the
plaintiff
has
now
gotten
a
settlement...
let's
assume
both
the
defendants
are
50
percent
liable,
and
let's
assume
the
settling
defendant
pays
what
amounts
to
75
percent
of
the...
of
the
actual
harm
suffered.
nonetheless,
the
state
is
going
to
make
the
non-settling
defendant
pay
a
full
50
percent...
25
percent
more
than
the...
than
the
plaintiff
is
really
entitled
to.
the
plaintiff
walks
away
with
a
25
percent
windfall.
it's
not
unfair
to
the
settling
defendant.
he
made
a
bad
settlement.
but
isn't
it
unfair
to
the
non-settling
defendant
to
make
him
pay...
to...
to
make
him
do
more
than
make
the
plaintiff
whole?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
feel
sorry
for
him.
it
serves
him
right.
he
entered
the
settlement.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
really
only...
it's
really
only
the
non-settling
defendant
who
has
any
cause
to
complain.
the
other
two
have...
have
made
a
deal.
and...
and
it's...
it's
fine
to
let
them
live
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
non-settling
defendant
is
still
being
made
by
the
court
to
do
more,
in
fact,
than
make
the
plaintiff
whole.
the
plaintiff
has
been
made
75
percent
whole
by
the
settlement,
so
the
court
should
really
say,
well,
you
know,
you
really
don't
have
any
claim
here,
except
for
the
remaining
25
percent.
nonetheless,
we're
going
to
make
this...
this
defendant
pay
you
50
percent.
that...
that's
unfair,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the...
the
basis
is,
if
he
had
settled
with
everybody,
that...
that's
fair
enough.
you
say,
you
got
rid
of
the
whole
suit
and
you
didn't
even
come
into
court.
you
didn't
ask
the
court
for
anything.
and
if
you
got
more
than
you
were
entitled
to,
well,
it's...
you
know,
that's
fair.
but
when
you
come
into
court,
it
seems
to
me,
you
come
in
saying,
i
have
been
injured
in
a
certain
amount.
and
that's
a
lie
if
in
fact
you've
gotten
80
percent
of
it
back
in
a
settlement
beforehand.
the
amount
of
your
injury
at
that
point
is
only
20
percent.
and
the
courts
are
here
to
do
justice,
not
to...
not
to
enable
people
to
trade...
trade
speculations
about
what
a
jury
is
going
to
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
what,
you...
you
think...
you
think
he
is
going
to...
when...
that...
that
the
actor,
before
he
commits
the
tort,
is
going
to
predict
that
there's
going
to
be
a
settlement
of...
of
the
other
actor?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
see
how
it
has
any
relevance,
whatever,
to
predictable
behavior
by...
by
people
in
maritime
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
couhig,
when--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
does...
under
your
system,
when...
when
does
the
non-settling
defendant
make
this
election...
after...
after
the
fact?
i
mean,
is
he
monday
morning
quarterbacking?
he's
seen
what...
what
verdict
the
jury
has
come
in
with?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
he
makes
it
at
the
outset
of
the
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
very
sportsmanlike,
it
really
is.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
they...
they
can
white
that
out
in
the
settlement
agreement,
too.
i
mean,
you...
you...
you
talk
about
what
the
party...
parties
can
change
by
their
agreement.
so,
also,
the
settling
defendant
can
write
into
the
agreement
if
a
non-settling
defendant
should
choose
the
other,
you
will
pay
me
so
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we're
chasing
our
own
tail
in
all
of
this,
aren't
we,
if...
if
we're
trying
to
guarantee
no
more
than
100
percent
recovery?
it
can't
be
guaranteed.
the
parties
can
contract
out
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
couhig,
i...
i
think
your
response
to
justice
souter
is
that
it's
one
thing
to
let
somebody
who,
by
private
agreement,
has
gotten
more
money
than
he's
entitled
to,
which
money
has
been
voluntarily
given
to
him
by
the
other
person
to
let
him
skip
off
with
it...
that's
one
thing...
it's
another
thing
to
use
the
power
and
majesty
of
the
state
to
wring
from
somebody,
who...
who
was
not
a
party
to
that
voluntary
agreement,
more
money
than
the
other
person
deserves.
there
is
just
something
a
little
worse
about
the
one
than
there
is
about
the
other.
it's...
it's...
call
it
state
action
versus
state
inaction,
if
you
wish,
but...
but
using
the
courts
to...
to
extract
an
excess
is
quite
different
from
allowing
the
parties
themselves
to
create
an
excess.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
couhig,
why...
why
do
we...
i...
i
guess
i
don't
understand
your...
your...
the
king
solomon
approach
that
you've
offered
us
here.
i
thought
that
one
of
the
advantages
of
that...
you
know,
putting
the
choice
upon
the
non-settling
defendant...
is
that
you
don't
have
a
good
faith
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
isn't
any
good
faith
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that...
that's
the
advantage
of
that.
he...
he
looks
at
it.
if
it
looks
bad
faith,
he
goes
the
other
way.
