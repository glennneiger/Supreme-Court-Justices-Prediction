m.
kennedy
well,
well,
but
justice
ginsburg
is...
is
correct,
is
she
not,
that
each...
each
of
the
rules
we're
going
to
be
discussing
has
certain
disadvantages?
and
one
disadvantage
of
the
proportionate
fault
rule,
as
you
call
it,
or
pro
rata
allocation,
is
that
a
party
may
settle
for
too
much
or
too
little,
and
that
the
total
dollars
are
not
allocated
in
accordance
with
the
ultimate
jury
verdict.
i
mean,
that
is
a...
a...
a
flaw
in
the
symmetry
of
the
scheme,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
practicable
or
does
it
ever
occur
that
a
settling
defendant
would
say,
i'll
assume
that
i
am
responsible
for
10
percent,
and...
and
the...
the
settling
plaintiff
will
accept
that,
but
then
they
leave
a...
a
certain
amount
to
be
deducted
or
added,
depending
on
the
jury's
verdict,
say,
within
the
range
of
another
$50,000?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as...
as
a
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
still
is
possible
to
enter
into
such
an
agreement,
and...
and
thereby,
by
contract,
reduce
the
concerns...
what
one
party
or
both
parties
have
about
receiving
too
much
and
too
little?
in
other
words,
the
contract
option
is
open?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
defendant
exercising
the
option
always
know
the
amount
of
the
settlement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i'm
not
sure
how
to
evaluate
your
argument
that
an
in...
insolvency
would
skew
the
symmetry
of
the
scheme
under
the
pro
rata...
or
proportionate
fault
theory.
if
the
settling
defendant
is
insolvent,
then
i
assume
the...
the
settlement
is
void.
and
if...
if
the
defendant
who
is
insolvent
is...
is
a
non-settling
defendant,
then
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
thought
you
said
that
the
risks
of
an
insolvency
on
the
part...
of
a
judgment-proof
defendant
were
a
reason
for
adopting
your
rule.
and
i...
i
don't
understand
why
that
should
be.
