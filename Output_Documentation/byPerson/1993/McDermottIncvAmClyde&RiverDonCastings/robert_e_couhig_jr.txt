mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
goal
in
any
damage
claim
in
admiralty
should
be
compensation,
not
reward.
we
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
there
are
three
fundamental
principles
that
this
court
and
the
law
keeps
in
mind:
first,
the
promotion
of
full
recovery
by
an
injured
plaintiff
should
be,
and
has
been,
consistently
followed
through.
secondly,
the
encouragement
of
settlements.
and,
third,
the
equitable
sharing
of
losses.
let
me
state
at
the
outset
that
any
system
adopted
hard
and
fast,
whether
it's
pro
tanto,
pro
rata
or
proportional,
carries
with
it
some
problem.
and
so
that,
while
in
this
case...
this
case
was
tried
as
a
pro
tanto
case...
and
the
record,
i
believe,
reflects
that...
that
is,
when
the
settlement
was
made
on
the
morning
of
trial,
and...
and
the
settlement
was
announced
that
the
sling
defendants
had
paid
a
million
dollars
in
settlement,
we
announced
that
we
would
take
the
hernandez
credit.
and
i
am
going
to
ultimately
suggest
that
this
court
has
within
its
power
the
ability
now
to
set
a
rule
that
will
give
guidance
to
all
parties
and
meet
the
discussion
and
the...
and
the
questions
and
the
concerns
that
have
been
raised
this
morning.
the
problems,
obviously,
don't
exist
if
the
case
goes
to
trial
against
several
multiple
defendants.
defendant
a
is
found
30
percent
at
fault;
defendant
b
is
70
percent
at
fault;
there's
a
million
dollars
worth
of
damage.
if
defendant
b
can
only
pay
half
of
that
amount,
this
court
would
still
find...
i
believe
the
law
recognizes...
that
defendant
a
would
have
to
come
up
with
the
rest,
regardless
of
its
proportionate
fault
finding.
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
we
go
off
on
a
proportionate
fault
basis
today,
that
we
may
place
that
in
jeopardy.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
case
goes
to
trial
against
only
one
of
those
two
defendants,
it
is
a
fiction
to
suggest
that
on
the
morning
of
trial,
when
a
settlement
is
announced
among
one
of
the
defendants
and
the
plaintiff,
that
the
jury
is
going
to
hear
all
of
the
evidence
in
an
appropriate
manner
to
make
a
reasonable
decision
as
to
the
real
fault
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
justice
souter,
what
happens
in
an
instant
like
that
is
that
the
plaintiff
who,
up
until
now,
had
been
attempting
to
prove
fault
on
both
a
and
b,
at
that
moment,
becomes
the
defender
of...
of
defendant
a.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
it
also
puts
the
non-settling
defendant
in
a
difficult
position.
because
now,
up
until
now,
the
expectation...
and
the
reasonable
expectation...
has
been
that
the
plaintiff
would
attempt
to
carry
the
day
against
that
defendant.
and
the
defend...
the
second
defendant,
the
non-settling
defendant,
was
concerned
about
his
own
responsibility
vis-a-vis
the
plaintiff.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
with
respect,
sir,
i
disagree
to
this
extent:
as
one
prepares...
as
in
this
case,
two
years
of
discovery...
and
you
get
there
and
you
know
what
your
case
is
about,
and
you
know
that
you're
going
to
defend
your
product,
and
you
know
the...
the
approach
that
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
take,
then
you
have
control
over
your
witnesses
and
you
have
the
responsibility
to
get
there
and
do
it.
but
when,
on
the
morning
of
trial,
it
is
announced
that
that
defendant
is
no
longer
a
party,
you
lose
control
over
certain
witnesses.
you
lose
certain
allegiances
that
would
take
place.
and
at
that
point
it
becomes
so
skewered
that
it
is
impossible,
in
my
experience,
for
a
true
finding
of
fact
to
come
out.
it
becomes
a
fictionalized
account.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
simple,
practical
matters.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
will
all
the
witnesses
be
there
that
the
defendant
had
heretofore
thought
would
be
there?
now,
there
are
ways
that
you
can
take
care
of
that.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
right.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
and...
and...
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we
do
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i'm
simply
suggesting
is
that...
that
there
are
some
problems
with.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
if,
in...
well,
if,
in
fact,
we
were
to
adopt
or
the
pro
rata
approach
is
adopted,
the
first
and
most
obvious
to
me
approach
is
that
we
get
away
from
the...
the...
the
idea
of
full
compensation
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
i...
i
think
the...
it's
difficult
to
describe,
but
the
orientation
in
the
case
changes
markedly
then.
the--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--you're
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
the
problem
with
that,
i
might
suggest,
though,
is
that
that
isn't
what
the
system
is
about.
it's
not
even
what
the
pro
rata
system
is
about.
that's
not
leading
to
a
fair
determination
as
to
an
individual
defendant's
responsibility.
that's
allowing
the
plaintiff
to
fund
it
up
and
to
put
on
a
better
case
against
whom
he
perceives
to
have
the
deeper
pocket,
perhaps,
or
the
easier
target,
for
whatever
reason...
not
the...
not
the
essential
fairness
as
to
what
that
defendant
did
or
did
not--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--he
does.
and
the
only
problem
with
that--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--he...
he
does,
your
honor,
except
he
gets
that
benefit...
and
i
don't
disagree
with
that...
but
he
also
gets
the...
the
unbenefit
or...
or
it's
not
a
benefit
to
the
extent
that
perhaps
at
the
real
trial,
under
the
real
circumstances,
as
i
believe
in
this
instance
the
court
of
appeals
talked
about,
there
would
have
been
a
higher
finding
of
fault
on
the
non-existent
defendant.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
i
mean,
so...
so
we--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--but
the
point
is,
as
i
believe
justice
scalia
accurately
pointed
it
out,
who
should
bear
that
risk?
obviously,
in
any
settlement
between
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--well,
if
that
was
the
only
poss...
policy,
you'd
be
absolutely
correct.
but
there
are
two
other
competing
policies,
and
that's
the
equitable
sharing
of
the
losses,
and
that's
the
promotion
of
the
full
recovery
on
the
plaintiff's
part.
and
my
suggestion
to
the
court
is
that
this
does
not
allow
it.
this
skewers
in
favor
of
proportional
sharing,
perhaps,
and
puts
aside
the...
the
promotion
of
full
re...
recovery.
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
look
into,
as
the
state
of
texas--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--or
he
gets
significantly
more,
and
he
has
been
rewarded
for
that
decision.
and
that's
where
i
believe
the
inherent
unfairness
comes
in.
if
we
were
to--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--i...
i
don't
know
that
to
be
the
case,
your
honor.
i
think
every
case
comes
under
its
own
force
when
we
look
at
it,
the
underlying
facts.
and...
and
that
is
why,
your
honor,
my
suggestion
to
the
court,
that
it
use
its
inherent
power
to
define
the
rule,
as
when
the
settling
parties,
the
plaintiff
and
a
defendant
settle,
the
party
who
has
been
left
out
of
that
negotiation
then
has
the
option,
as
they
do
in
texas,
of
choosing
between
a
proportional
determination
or
a
pro
tanto
dollar
for
dollar.
what
that
does
is
in
insinuates
him
into,
or
her
into,
that
discussion...
not,
per
se,
in
the...
in
the
sense
of
sitting
down,
but
so
that
when
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
are
talking
about,
how
do
we
do
this,
it
is
more
likely
to
bring
it
into
the
confines
of
a
fair
and
equitable
settlement
to
everyone.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
your
honor,
in
our
case,
it
was
my
belief,
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
law
was
to
the
effect
that
only
the
pro
tanto
rule
applied.
it
was
decided
in
1988.
this
case
was
tried
in
november
of
1990.
in
september
of
1990,
the
myers
decision
also
came
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
indicating
pro
tanto
was
the
appropriate
way.
we
tried
this
case
under
the
pro
tanto
regime.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
what
i
have
just
suggested
is
a
case
for...
is
a...
is
a
rule
for
the
future;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
it
has,
your
honor,
with
respect,
in
texas;
that
election
is
allowed
under
texas
state
law.
in
new
york,
they
have
a...
a
derivation
of
it
that
i
think
goes
to
the
one
satisfaction
rule,
which
says
it
is
the
higher
of
the
two.
that
operates
as
a...
as
a
matter
of
law.
my
suggestion
is
that
the
texas
approach
is
really
the
inherently
more
fair
approach
because
it
allows...
and
it
gets
away
from
this
ques--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--your
honor,
if
i
might
disagree
for
one
moment.
the...
the...
one
of
the
salutary
effects
of
this
is
that
the
settling
defendant
is
gone.
there
is
no
fairness
hearing
or
good
faith
hearing.
because
the
hearing,
in
effect,
takes
place
when
the
plaintiff
and
that
settling
defendant
discuss
it.
and
in
this
case,
if
they
had
reached
a
decision
of
a
million
dollars,
the
plaintiff
would
be
in
a
position
of
saying,
if
i
do
that
and
they
choose
pro
rata,
here
is
the
effect;
if
i
choo...
if
they
choose
pro
tanto,
here
is
the
effect.
but,
in
any
case,
the
defend...
the
other
defendant
is
gone.
he
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
a
settlement
conference.
the...
the...
the
point
would
be
that
at
that
point
in
time,
in
effect,
the
persons
most
knowledgeable
about
the
facts
would
have
evaluated
their
inherent
risk,
they
would
have
come
to
an
agreement
between
the
two
of
them,
and
the
third
party
who
is
left
out
of
it
would
still
be
there,
in
effect,
able
to
judge
it
and
to
make
sure
that
there
was
not
an
unfair
reward
instead
of
compensation;
or,
if
in
fact
there
had
been
some
collusion
or
some
gamesmanship
that
would
give
them
an
unfair
advantage
at
the
trial,
he
would
be
protected.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
suggest
that
there
are
two
possible
cures
to
that.
generally,
in
a
settlement,
the
settling
defendant
will
place
in
the
settlement
document
an
indemnity
provision.
so
that,
contractually,
even
if...
and...
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
facts
of
the
other
case
with
not...
out
knowing
more
precision...
but,
even
if
there
was
a
claim
against
them,
the
indemnity
provision
that
would
run
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
would,
in
effect,
be
a
bar
to
that
recovery.
they
would
get
a
credit
for
it,
or
whatever.
this
proposal
doesn't
even
need
to
get
to
that
point,
because,
as
part
of
it,
there'd
be
no
need
for
a
contribution
claim
because
the
non-settling
defendant
would
have
been
a
party,
in
effect,
to
the
settlement.
he
would
have
been
able
to
evaluate
what
was
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
let
me--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
absolutely
not.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
he
makes
it
as
soon
as
practical
after
the
announcement.
let
me...
let
me
use
two
examples.
you...
you--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--well,
there
is
no
easy
answer
to
this.
and...
and
i
could
argue,
i
believe...
and
there
is
an
excellent
argument
for
pro
tanto...
to
do
anything
else
other
than
pro
tanto
allows
double
recovery
in
many,
many
instances.
and
it
eviscerates
the
real
need
for
a
sharing
of
losses
and
the
like.
and
it
allows
collusion.
what
this
does
is
not
sporting,
per
se;
it
is...
it
is
a
simple
methodology
that
allows
the
players
most
involved
in
it
to
evaluated
their
risk
and
to
come
up
with
a
procedure
that
allows
fairness
to
all
sides.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
he
should.
generally,
they
do.
and
i
think,
certainly,
in
an
instant
like
this,
there
would
be
no
need
for...
for
secrecy.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
one...
one--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--the
parties,
justice
scalia,
can
contract
in
many
different
ways.
and...
and
you're
correct
about
this.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
this
is
a
possible
method
of
eliminating
or,
if
not
eliminating,
greatly
reducing
the
propensity
for
either
double
recoveries
or
placing
a
defendant
in
a
disadvantage
because
of
some
either
collusive
or
inappropriate
settlement
or
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
but
unfair
to
that
defendant.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
i...
i...
i
don't
want
to
get
so
far
off
into
this
proposal
that
i
forget
the
reason
i'm
here,
which
is
our
case
in
particular...
which
was
tried
under
the
pro
tanto
regime,
in
which
the
fairness
of
it
comes
out
very
dramatically:
what
do
we
do
with
the
million
dollars
that
they
receive?
to
give
them...
to
give
us
no
credit
for
that
million
dollars
allows
them
to--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
river
don
to...
is
the
defendant
in
this
case
who
is
obligated
under
the
present
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
pay
approximately
$470,000.
if
one
adds
to
that
the
million
dollars--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--i
don't
believe,
justice
stevens,
we
can
say
that.
because
the
case
wasn't
tried
in
that
circumstance.
and
to
suggest
that--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--if
there
was
a
holding
of
38
percent--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--responsibility
and
a
$2.1
million
judgment,
and
if
only
mcdermott
was
held
to
be
30
percent
responsible,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
justice
souter,
in
this
case
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
reflects
enough
to...
to
make
that
decision.
the
case
was
not
tried
as
a
pro
rata
case.
it
was
tried
as
a
division
of
responsibility
or
causation
between
mcdermott,
amclyde
and
river--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
if...
if
you
take
our
case
out
of
it,
i
agree
with
you,
yes,
sir...
that--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
the...
the...
the
issue
of
whether
pro
rata
or
pro
tanto
is
the
more
appropriate
one...
pro
rata
carries
with
it
certain
advantages,
just
as
pro
tanto
does.
each
has
within
it
inherent
advantages
and
disadvantages.
the
choice
that
has
to
be
made--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
if
one
pretermits
the
arguments
about
how
the
trial
would
take
place
and...
and
the
things
that
we've
been
through
before,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
proportionate,
yes,
ma'am.
i'm
using
them
interchangeably,
and
i
apologize.
the...
the
real
point,
though,
is
that
the
decision
that
has
to
be
made
is,
should
one...
should
the
court
and
the
law
favor
full
recovery,
but
limited
to
a
single
satisfaction,
or
should
the
balance
go
towards
an
equitable
sharing
of
the
losses
through
a
proportional
system?
and
my
only
point
in
all
of
this
is
that
the
first
linchpin
of
it
is,
what
is
the
purpose
of
bringing
the
lawsuit?
the
plaintiff
has
sustained
damages.
it
is
to
make
him
whole,
but
not
to
reward
him.
and
with
the
pro
rata
system,
that
opportunity
exists.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
as
to
those
two
parties,
it
makes
no
difference.
but
let
me
suggest
to
the
court
that,
suppose--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--well,
let...
let
me,
justice
souter,
try
this
as
a...
by
way
of
explanation.
suppose
in
this
instance
the
jury
had
determined
that
the
damages
were
only
$1
million
and
they
had
already
received
$1
million
from
a
settling
defendant.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
well,
those
things
happen.
and
we
cited
to
the
court
in
our
brief
an
instance
from
english
law
where
the
court
looked
at
that.
and...
and
what
they
saw
was
that
the
plaintiff
had
been
made
whole.
and
so
there
is
no
need
for
further
recovery.
and
it
all
goes
back
to
what
is...
what
is
driving
this.
is
it
the
need
to
make
the
plaintiff
whole
or
is
it
the
need
to
proportionately
share
fault
and
give
the
plaintiff
the
opportunity
to
be
made
more
than
whole?
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
exactly
correct,
justice--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--justice
souter,
at
that
point,
the
plaintiff
is
no...
has
been
compensated
for
his
injury.
he
lost
a
million
dollars
in
property.
he
has
received
his
million
dollars.
to
follow
through,
we
try
the
case
now.
and
the
defendant...
remaining
defendant
is
found
50
percent
responsible
for
that
million
dollars.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
you
are
correct,
sir,
with...
with
this
one
caveat.
when
we
go
try
this
case...
the
remaining
defendant...
and
now,
as
the
remaining
defendant,
i
will
put
on
the
plaintiff's
case
against
the
settled
defendant,
so
that
that
defendant's
proportional
fault
can
be
found...
the
case
is
going
to
last
just
as
long,
there
is
going
to
be
just
as
much
argument,
just
as
much
evidence,
just
as
many
witnesses--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--so
that
there...
i
don't
think
it...
it...
the...
there's
no
real
savings
in
terms
of
time.
the...
the
savings
is
that
you
don't
have
a
contribution--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--claim.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
and
i
see
the
court's...
your
point,
sir.
but
where
i
would
disagree
is
that
you're
going
to
have
some
messiness
or
some
collateral
issues
regardless.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
there's
no
good
faith
hearing.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
that's...
it
sounds
so,
sir,
except
that,
at
that
point,
the
plaintiff,
just
as
he
does
now
under
a
pro
rata
system,
if
we
were
to
try
it
under...
steps
forward
and,
in
effect,
defends
him.
but
the
actual
party,
you
are
correct,
has
no
longer
a
vested
interest
in
the
outcome.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
there...
there
are
difficulties
with
measurement,
but
i
think
those
can
be
overcome
through...
through
the
use
of
either
experts
or
in-house
people,
and
they
can
be
quantified,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
i
agree
with
how
you've
just
laid
out
the
question,
sir.
i
don't
know
that
i
understand--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--if,
for
example,
under
the
pro
tanto
regime,
the
dollar-for-dollar
regime,
the...
the
court
of
the
law's
principle
purpose
of
allowing
full
recovery
is
satisfied...
because
if
there
is
an
insolvent
defendant,
just
as
one
can
do,
you...
you
would
go
against
the
other
defendant
that
would
not...
that
would
have
a
contribution
right,
but
without
real
remedy,
but
the
plaintiff
could
receive
his
full
recovery.
under
the
system
of
choosing
among
the
parties,
and
after
the
plaintiff
and
a
settling
defendant
choose...
it
would
allow
the
non-settling
defendant
to
choose...
that
non-settling
defendant
would
be
aware
of
the
economic
circumstances.
and...
and
let
me
suggest
if,
for
example,
the...
the
defendant
who
was
settling
had
relatively
few
funds,
was,
in
effect,
going
to
either
go
out
of
business
or
had
gone
out
of
business,
or
the
litigation
was
driving
them
out
of
business
and
they
wanted
to
put
up
some
dollars...
before
they
did
that,
the
plaintiff
would
look
at
it
and
say,
what
is
this
going
to
do,
and,
what
is
this
going
to
create
with
the
non-settling
defendant?
and
that
non--
mr.
robert
e.
couhig,
jr.
--thank
you,
sir.
