justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
that
point,
if
the
plaintiff
prevailed
there
would
have
to
be
an
entire
new
trial,
because
the
defendant
also
would
have
a
right
to
jury
trial.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
there
be
estoppel
when
the
defendant
succeeded...
won
the
judgment.
you
can't
appeal
from
an
adverse
portion
of
an
opinion
if
the
judgment
is
in
your
favor.
defendant,
in
that
case,
not
being
in
a
position
to
appeal
the
judgment
in
defendant's
favor,
then
in
fairness,
must
be
able
to
have
a
whole
new
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
not
the...
what
was
the
ultimate
judgment
in
the
district
court?
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
judgment
entered
for
the
plaintiff,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah,
and
one
appeals
from
a
judgment,
not
from
an
opinion
and
not
from
a
finding.
you
can't
appeal...
if
you
win
the
judgment,
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
you
can't
appeal
from
an
adverse
finding
made
along
the
way.
the
judgment
winner
can't
appeal
even
though
there
was
a
finding...
an
intermediate
finding
against
the
judgment
winner,
isn't
that
correct?
you
appeal
from
a
judgment,
not
from
an
opinion
and
not
from
a
finding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
the
further
point--
--it's
a
fairly
important
issue.
it
seems
to
me
you
wouldn't
have
to
come
down
with
an
all
or
nothing
answer
here
that
the
act...
based
on
when
the
wrongs,
alleged
wrongs
occurred.
but
at
least
to
the
jury
trial
and
damages
remedy,
if
the
trial
had
already
taken
place
that
would
be
a
more
appropriate
place
to
divide
the
effectiveness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
don't
recognize
the
defend...
that
a
defendant
would
have
an
argument,
well,
i'm
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
too.
and
it
isn't
often
that
you
would
bifurcate
liability
and
damages,
because
the
two
are...
often
intertwine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah.
well,
there
was
no
judgment.
there
was
never
a
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
a
district
court
judgment
for
the
defendant,
and
that's
quite
different
from
what
was
involved
in
park
lane.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
authority
for
a...
an
appeal
from
a
favorable
decision,
where
a
party
is
allowed
to
appeal
from
a
favorable
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't
want
to
sidetrack
you
on
that
anymore.
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
some
redundancy
in
this...
in
this
act.
110(b)
says
exactly
the
same
thing
as
402(a),
so
it
isn't
the
most
carefully
drafted
piece
of
legislation.
there's
no
reason
to
have
this...
the
same
sentence
in
110(b)
as
there
is
in
402(a),
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
discussion
with
mr.
schnapper
was
over
whether
there
was
a
finding...
there
was
no
judgment
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
a
judgment
for
the
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
my
understanding
is
that
winners
can't
appeal
from
a
favorable
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
days--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
that
connection,
on
the
substance/procedure
divide,
whether
it's
in
the
erie
context
or
the
choice
of
law
context,
whether
it's
vertical
or
horizontal,
damages,
as
far
as
i
know,
are
always
put
on
the
substantive
side
of
the
line,
mode
of
trial
on
the
procedural
side.
but
you
are
saying
that
these
two
travel
together,
so
that
the
right
to
damages
for
the
first
time,
for
money
other
than
back
pay,
you
are
classifying
as
remedial,
nonsubstantive,
and
yet
in
the
choice
of
law
context
it's...
classically,
damages
are
substantive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
authority
even
for
compensatory
damages
being
something
that
one
would
class
as
not
substantive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
days,
i
haven't
seen
any
case,
at
least
in
this
court,
where
an
augmentation
of
the
penalty...
of
the
damages,
i
withdraw
the
word
penalty,
but
where
an
increase
in
available
damages
has
been
applied
retroactively.
and
you
told
me
there
is
a
second
circuit
case
in
a
securities
matter,
but
is
there
any
case
in
this
court
where
a
statute
augmenting
a
monetary
toll
was
applied
retroactively
to
preenactment
conduct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
it
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
don't
we--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
nager,
stick
closer
to
home.
in
the
context
of
title
vii,
i
think
your
answer
was
that
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
cases
did
not
come
to
this
court.
it's
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about
the
civil
rights
restoration
act
of
'87?
is...
what
is
the
language
there
and
what
is
the...
what
views
have
been
expressed
by
the
courts
on
the
retroactivity
of
that
act
that,
let
me
see,
made
the
law
different
from
what
it
was
when
grove
city
was
decided?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be
the
closest,
i
think,
wouldn't
it,
to
the
patterson
situation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
case
of
the
1987
act,
the
returns
in
the
lower
court
are
divided.
you
conceded
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
retro...
and
so
would
you
agree
that
the
answer
should
be
the
same
in
this
case
as
it
is
in
that,
at
least
with
respect
to
patterson
and
grove
city?
the
statute
itself
in
'87
said
legislative
action
is
necessary
to
restore
the
prior
consistent
long
understanding
of
what
the
law
was.
so
in
that
respect
the
two
are
alike
and
should
logically
go
the
same
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
there's
a
stronger
argument
for
the
retroactivity
of
the
'87
act
than
of
the
1991
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
nager,
as
far
as
knowing
what
the
law
is,
i
mean
the
law
has
been,
throughout
this
period,
thou
shalt
not
discriminate.
so
the
precise...
the
conduct-regulating
rule...
maybe
with
some
exceptions
in
the
1981
situation,
but
certainly
in
the
landgraf
case
the
rule
was
there
all
along,
thou
shalt
not
discriminate.
and
it's
not
like
a
traffic
ticket,
with
all
apologies
to
the
seventh
circuit
judge
who
said
it's
like
taking
a
traffic
ticket
and
putting
you
in
prison
for
life.
the
rule
was
very
strong
since
the
day
title
vii
came
in,
thou
shalt
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of...,
and
all
that
has
been
done
is
to
make
the
price
tag
higher.
but
you're
not
really
suggesting
that
a
defendant
would
make
the
calculation
that
it's
okay
to
discriminate
because
the
only
thing
i
might
be
liable
for
is
back
pay
and
injunctive
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
a
finding
that
the
employer's
conduct
was
in
violation
of
the
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that...
does
that
go
for
all
the
decisions?
this
one
concentrates
on
patterson,
but
what
about
shaw
against
library
of
congress?
is
that
showing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the...
this
particular
problem
before
us
today
was
the
shaw--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--problem,
even
though
that
involves
the...
another...
yet
another
maxim,
that
sovereign
immunity
and
waivers
strictly
construed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you...
the
solicitor
general,
i
believe,
had
a
caveat
about...
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
share
that.
