justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
section
402(a)
doesn't...
is
not
clear,
is
it,
in
telling
us
whether
it
can
be
retroactively
applied?
i
mean
theoretically
the
statute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--could
become
effective
on
the
date
of
its
passage
but
not
be
retroactive
under
that
language.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
you
rely
on
these
two,
109(c)
and
402(b),
exceptions--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
the
meaning
of
the
402(a).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
we
should
be
looking
to
the
kinds
of
principles
that
govern
the
erie
doctrine
or
the
rules
enabling
it,
to
see
what
types
of
things
could
be
immediately
applied
and
what
couldn't.
does
that
make
some
sense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
nager--
--well,
the--
--according
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
opinion
in...
is
it
reynolds
v.
martin?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
panel
there
took
the
position
that
congress
had
not
only
addressed
it
but
the
language
is
clear,
and
when
you
look
at
the
provisions
relied
upon
by
mr.
schnapper
that
it
becomes
a
plain
language
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
language
that
includes
"except
as
otherwise
provided"
and
then
an
exception,
in
what
cases
here
do
you...
do
you
think
support
your
view
that
even
the
natural
inference
of
the
statute
will
be
ignored
in
favor
of
nonretroactivity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
there
cases
from
this
court
that
express
such
a
view?
