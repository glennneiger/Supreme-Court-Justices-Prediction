mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
responding
to
the
point
that
justice
ginsburg
made
with
respect
to
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
as
we've
set
out
at
note
14
of
our
brief
on
pages
24
and
25,
we
think
that
in
a
situation
where
there
has
not
been
a
finding
of
liability
for
a
plaintiff,
the
application
of
this
new
rule
would
require
a
remand
and
an
entire
trial...
jury
trial
on
that
issue,
not
merely
on
the
question
of
damages.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
and
what
we've
offered
in
our
brief
is
a
variety
of
alternatives
that
the
court
might
consider
in
terms
of
how
a
trial
on
remand
might
be
handled
by
the
lower
court.
i
wanted
to
pick
up
on
my
colleague,
mr.
schnapper's
argument
about
the
bradley,
bennett,
bowen
rules,
that
he
began
to
discuss.
as
he
indicated,
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
language
structure
analysis
that
he
provided
to
the
court
provides
a
reasonable
inference
that
congress
intended
for
the
act,
with
the
exception
of
402(b)
and
109(c),
to
apply
to
pending
cases.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
court
finds
difficulty
with
that,
we
think
that
there
is
one
inference
that
certainly
can
be
drawn
from
that
language
and
structure
analysis,
and
that
is
that
congress
intended
that
at
least
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
1991
act
would
have
applicability
to
pending
cases.
in
other
words,
the
language
points
in
the
direction
of
some
applicability
to
pending
cases.
what
that
directive
provides
is
an
invitation
for
courts
to
evaluate
the
remaining
provisions
of
the
act
against
a
backdrop
of
jurisprudence
having
to
do
with
default
rules
in
those
instances
where
it
is
not
clear
whether
certain
provisions
should
be
applied
to
pending
cases
or
not
to
pending
cases.
so
we
think
that
the
language
structure
argument
and
the
default
rule
analysis
are
mutually
reinforcing.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we
would
regard
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
as
a
procedural
right,
and
under
normal
circumstances
that
would
require
a
jury
trial.
but
we
would
also
suggest,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
that
where
a
trial
has
occurred
and
it
is
an
error-free
trial
even
without
a
jury,
there
would
be
no
requirement
for
a
trial
before
a
jury
to
the
extent
that
the
new
rule
applied.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
scalia,
that's
certainly
one
way
of
approaching
it,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
provides
any
greater
certainty
than
the
rule
that
we're
suggesting,
namely
that
the
court
approach
the
issue
by
looking
at
substantive
changes
on
the
one
hand,
and
procedural
or
remedial
on
the
other.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
it
does.
certainly,
the
approach
that
we
suggest,
namely
the
substantive
on
the
one
hand,
and
procedural,
remedial
on
the
other,
is
a
dichotomy
that's
very
familiar
to
the
courts
across
the
face
of--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--of
law.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
our
position
is
that
that
is
remedial,
that
what
the
statute--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
the
situation
is
more
problematic
with
respect
to
punitives.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
there
are
decisions
in
the
lower
court
that
have
allowed
double
damages
in
situations
where
there
was
a
change
in
the
law,
even
though
that
was
not
the
rule
prior
to
the
change
in
law.
i
don't
have
that
specific
citation,
but
there
is
a
second
circuit
case
in
which
that
was
done
in
a
securities
matter.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
ex
post
facto
law
would
come
into
effect
when
we're
talking
about
criminal
penalties.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
we
disagree
as
to
what
the
rule
is.
you're
asserting
that
the
rule
is
against
retroactivity.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
but
i'm
talking
about
in
the
civil
context,
and
i
think
that
we've
shown
in
our
briefs
and
the
briefs
of
petitioner
that
the
rule
has
really
been
one
that
makes
that
distinction
between
substance,
on
the
one
hand,
and
procedure
and
remedy
on
the
other.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
your
honor.
no,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
in
this
court.
but
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
make
the
distinction
between
ousting
someone
of
vested
rights
or
imposing
new
obligations
without
notice
or
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
but
they
have
not
focused
on
damages
as
such.
where
new
remedies
are
provided
for
old
wrongs,
we...
we
read
the
law
as
saying
that
that
is
not
a
substantive
change.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we
think
that
punitive
damages
are
more
difficult
because
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
txo,
for
example,
in
justice
stevens'
opinion,
that
there
are
requirements
of
notice
that
ought
to
be
provided
to
a
person
before
that
person
is
subjected
to
punitive
damages.
we
don't
think
that
the
same
requirement
is
necessary
under
these
circumstances,
that
is
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages.
the...
thank
you.
