mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
is
whether
sections
101
and
102
of
the
1991
civil
rights
act
apply
to
the
claims
in
these
cases,
both
of
which
arose
prior
to
november
21st,
1991,
the
effective
date
of
the
civil
rights
act.
with
regard
to
rivers,
the
practical
question
is
whether
in
the
future
this
and
other
section
1981
cases
which
arose
before...
prior
to
november
1991
will
be
governed
by
section
101
of
the
'91
act
or
by
this
court's
1989
decision
in
patterson,
which
the
civil
rights
act
overturned.
with
regard
to
landgraf,
the
practical
question--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
i'll
accept
your
characterization
of
it.
with
regard
to
landgraf,
the
practical
question
is
whether
plaintiffs
who
are
injured
by
intentional
acts
of
discrimination
occurring
prior
to
november,
1991
can
obtain
the
additional
remedies
provided
by
section
102.
if
section
102
is
not
available,
then
petitioner
landgraf,
who
has
established
that
she
was
the
victim
of
intentional
discrimination,
will
have
no
remedy
whatsoever.
there
are
two
distinct
reasons
why
we
maintain
that
section
101
and
102--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--if
section
102
applies,
then
either
party
could
request
a
jury
trial,
that's
right.
and
so
that's
raised
in
the
landgraf
case.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
right,
that's
right.
it's
only
if
there's
a
right
to
damages
that
the
right
to
jury
trial
is
available
to
either
side.
there
are
two
distinct--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
bench
trial
that
was
conducted
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
civil
rights
act
established
liability,
and
we
believe
that
under
the
reasoning
of
this
court's
decision
in
park
lane
hosiery,
that
estoppel
by
judgment
precludes
either
side--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
in
the
landgraf
case
the
judgment
was
in
the
plaintiff's
favor.
the
district
judge
found
that
there
had...
that
there
was
a
pattern
of
sexual
harassment
and
the
defendant
could
have
cross
appealed
on
that
issue.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
wasn't...
there
wasn't
judgment
entered
for
the
plaintiff.
the
court
found
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
law
and--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that...
that
when
we
were
in
the
court
of
appeals
arguing
that
even
prior
to
the
civil
rights
act
we
were
entitled
to
greater
relief,
the
defendants
could
have
argued
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
any
relief
because
the
decision
as
to
liability
was
incorrect.
and,
in
any
event,
that
issue
could
be
addressed
on
remand.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
view
the
matter
differently,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
view
is
that
as
long
as
the
question
of
what
the
remedy
should
be
was
in
dispute,
which
it
was
at
the
time
the
act
was
adopted,
that
the
plaintiff
ought
to
be
able
to
invoke
the
statute.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no.
no,
our
view
is
that
so
long
as
the
right
manner
of
trial...
the
manner
of
trial
was
correct
under
the
law
as
it
stood
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
that
that
isn't...
that
that
method
of
trying
a
case
doesn't...
isn't
reopened.
i
mean,
it...
this
cuts
both
ways.
in
the
landgraf
case
the
petitioner
lost
on
some
issues
and
won
on
others.
we're
not
here
claiming
that
we're
entitled
to
go
back
and
retry
the
issues
we
lost.
mr.
eric
schnapper
oh,
we're
claiming
we
have
a
right
to
go
back
and
seek
additional
relief
in
the
form
of
damages.
if
we
are
allowed
to
do
that,
either
party
could
then
ask
for
a
jury
trial.
but
it
would
all...
the
hearing--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--right.
but
the
issue
to
be
tried
on
remand
is
not
going
to
be
liability,
it's
going
to
be
damages,
which
is
an
issue
that
was
not
tried
at
all
the
first
time
around.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
has,
however,
happened.
this
is,
in
effect,
what
happened
in
park
lane
hosiery
where
there
was
one
proceeding
properly
before
a
judge
in
which
liability
was
established
and
then
subsequent
proceedings
invoked
that
judgment.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
we
view
the
matter
differently.
mr.
eric
schnapper
now,
i'm
not
sure
whether
this
precise
circumstance
has
arisen.
it--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
let
me
also
say
that
it's
not
necessary
at...
in
this
case
and
in
this
present
posture,
for
this
court
to
address
that
collateral
judgment
by
estoppel
issue.
we
think
that
could
be
dealt
with
on
remand.
the
broader
question
here
is
whether
the
statute
can
be
invoked
at
all.
i
think
that's
the
issue
which
requires
resolution
here.
the
linchpin
of
our
argument
regarding
the
structure
and
language
of
the
statute
is
the
fact
that
there
are
two
expressly
prospective
provisions
in
the
act.
section
109(c),
with
regard
to
extraterritoriality,
provides
that
that
section
will
not
apply
to
conduct
occurring
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
if
petitioner
landgraf
had
worked
for
usi
in
mexico
she
could
not
invoke
the
statute.
section
109(c)
would
apply.
but
in
this
instance
respondent
usi
can't
invoke
section
109(c)
because
the
petitioner
worked
in
a
plant
in
texas.
similarly,
there
is
a
second
expressly
prospective
position...
provision
in
the
statute,
section
402(b),
which
expressly
exempts
from
any
application
of
the
act
any
preexisting
case
that
meets
three
requirements:
that
it
was
filed
before
1975;
that
the
first
decision
in
the
case
happened
after
march
of
1983;
and
that
it's
a
disparate
impact
case.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
was
the
understanding
of
congress
and
that's
our
understanding.
in
this...
in
this
case,
rivers'
and
landgraf's
case
meet
the
second
requirement
of
section
402(b)
but
don't
meet
the
first
or
the
third
requirement.
because
neither
of
the
expressly
prospective
provisions
are
available
to
respondents,
this
case
is
governed
by
section
402(a).
it's
our
contention
that
section
109(c)
and
402(b)
are
dispositive
of
the
meaning
of
section
402(a).
there
are
a
number
of
different,
well
established
rules
of
construction
which
we
think
apply
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
our...
if
all
we
had
here
was
the
language
take
effect
upon
enactment,
we
would
not
have
a
strong
argument.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
we
have
other
provisions
in
the
statute,
and
here,
as
in--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
we
also--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes.
but
we
also
rely
on
the
language
of
section
402(a)
which
begins:
"except
as
otherwise
specifically
provided".
the
only
plausible
reference
of
that
clause,
we
think,
is
section
402(b)
and
109(c).
now,
if
that's
the
reference,
the
word,
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
phrase
402(a)
is
different
than
those
exceptions.
so
we
do
rely
in
part
on
the
language
of
section
402(a).
as
i
was
saying,
there
are
a
number
of
well
established
rules
of
construction
which
we
contend
apply
here.
the
rule
that
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius,
the
rule
in
russello,
that
where
a
provision
such
as
109(c)
is
in
one
section
of
a
statute
but
not
another,
that
that
decision
was
deliberate.
we've
noted
in
our
arguments
that
if
the
view
of
respondent
were
accepted
that
402(a)
means
that
the
statute
is
applicable
to
any
preexisting
claim,
then
section
402(b)
would
be
entirely
redundant,
as
would
section
109(c).
the
construction
which
we
advance
has
the
effect
of
giving
independent
significance
and
force
to
all
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
agree,
your
honor,
that...
the
maxim
is
where
it's
possible
to
avoid
redundancy,
the
court
should
interpret
the
act
to
do
so.
it's
not
possible
with
regard
to
section
110.
it
is...
it
reads
exactly
the
same
as
402(a).
but
it
is
possible
to
construe
402(a)
in
a
manner
which
doesn't
render
402(b)
and
109(c)
redundant.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
i
wouldn't...
well,
i
would,
your
honor.
this
is
as...
this
structural
argument
we
advance
here
is
the
same
as
the
argument
the
court
accepted
in
pennsylvania
v.
union
gas,
that...
where
there
were
exceptions
in
that
case
specifically
providing
that
states
were
liable
for
certain
things,
the
court
concluded
that
that
was...
that
meant
the
extraordinarily
stringent
requirement
of
the
11th
amendment.
so
i
think
without
resolving
the
apparent
tension
between
bowen
and
bradley,
it
would
be
possible
to
resolve
this
case.
but
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
bowen
and
bradley
issue,
if
i
might.
the...
as
the
court
is
undoubtedly
aware,
there...
and
as
you
rightly
pointed
out,
there
are
a
number
of
seemingly
contradictory
presumptions
out
there,
the
bowen
line
of
cases
and
the
bradley
line
of
cases.
the...
it's
our
contention
that
those
lines
of
decisions
can
be
reconciled
and,
indeed,
they
are
complementary.
we
believe
that
these
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
because
these
rules
have
traditionally
been
applied
to
different
categories
of
statutes.
and
so
understood,
the
bowen
and
bradley
rules
can
be
reconciled.
the...
and
i
refer
here
now
not
only
to
decisions
of
this
court,
but
to
the
decisions
of
the
courts
in
the
states,
to
which
you
refer,
which
have
constitutional
prohibitions
against
retroactivity.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
we
listed
a
number
of
cases.
the
one
i
think
that
would...
particularly
apt
here
is
sturges,
your
honor,
in
which
the...
in
which
the
court
was
called
upon
to
apply
one
of
those
very
constitutional
prohibitions
against
retroactive
legislation
and
concluded
that
it
didn't
apply
to
legislation
with
regard
to
remedies
and
procedures.
your
honor,
if
i
might,
i
think
i'd
best
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
just
clarify
one
question
about
the
record
in
landgraf.
mr.
nager
was
correct
when
he
stated
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
plaintiff's
personnel
manager
had
corrected...
had
addressed
the
problem.
however,
the
record
also
demonstrates,
and
the
court
found,
that
that
happened
only
after
more
than
a
year
of
particularly
egregious
harassment,
during
which
time
the
victim
repeatedly
went
to
her
supervisor
who
responded
to
her
that
she
was
a
tattletale.
and
she
was
thereafter
threatened
on
a
number
of
occasions
for
having
complained.
so
this
is
not
a
situation
which
was
properly
and
happily
resolved.
secondly,
with
regard
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
whether
congress
understood
that
it
was
restoring
the
law
to
where
the
lower
courts,
at
least,
had
understood
it
was,
in
appendix
f
to
our
reply
brief
we
list
85
statements
by
members
of
congress,
both
republicans
and
democrats,
using
the
word
restore,
or
similar
language,
to
describe
what
the
statute
did.
mr.
eric
schnapper
in
general,
those
cases...
those
remarks
don't
distinguish
among...
some
are
specifically
about
patterson
or
other
cases,
but
generally
they're
about...
they're
referring
to
the
whole
statute.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
yes.
i
would--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--he
did.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
do
not.
the...
i'd
remind
the
court
in
this...
i'd
add
to
the
list
of
battling
presumptions
here,
another
one
in
this
court's
recent
decision
in
frankly
v.
gwinnett
county.
and
it's
one
of
those
clear
statement
rules
that
crop
up
repeatedly.
we
presume
the
availability
of
all...
presume
the
availability
of
all
appropriate
remedies
unless
congress
has
expressly
indicated
otherwise.
well,
here
we
are.
we're
seeking
the
remedy
of
damages.
it
seems
to
me
that
is...
that's
a
presumption
that
applies
here
as
well.
we
disagree
with
respondent
about
what
the...
the
reach
and
the
rationale
of
the
presumption
referred
to
by
justice
scalia
is.
our
view
is
the
same
advanced
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
it's
to
protect
good
faith
reliance
interests.
the
respondents
at
page
4
of...
excuse
me,
respondents
in
roadway,
in
page
4
of
their
brief,
referring
to
the
monetary
relief
that
might
be
available,
say
that
citizens
have
a
right
to
have
not
only
warning
of
what
the
law
prohibits,
but
also
its
sanctions,
so
that
they
can
avoid
those
sanctions
if
they
wish.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
compliance
with
title
vii
was
not
optional.
this
isn't
a
licensing
fee
that
says
you
can
violate
if
you're
willing
to
pay
the
cost.
mr.
eric
schnapper
with
all
deference,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
what
ordinarily
goes
on
in
the
business
community.
most
employers...
most
businessmen,
with
regard
to
any
statutes,
take
those
statutes
very
seriously
and
comply
with
them,
and
don't
make
calculations
about
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
$20,000
verdict
or
a
$30,000
verdict.
the
defense
in
this--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--we
do.
i...
we
remind
the
court
that
the
punitive
damages
are
capped,
and
capped
in
such
a
way
that
if
there's
a
large
compensatory
reward,
there
won't
be--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it
depends
on
the
size
of
the
employer.
mr.
eric
schnapper
on
punitive
damages
i
would,
you
know,
raise
somewhat
different
questions.
but--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes.
because
we
don't...
we
don't
think
employers
make
those
kinds
of
distinctions.
and
the
defense
in
this
case
was
to
have--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
your
honor.
one
of
the
purposes
of
punitive
damages
referred
in
the
legislative
history
was
to...
was
the
concept
noted
in
this
court's
decision
in
newman
v.
piggy
park,
to
provide
encouragement
for
private
parties
to
enforce
the
law
by
maintaining
these
lawsuits.
that
purpose
obviously
is
served
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
thank
you.
