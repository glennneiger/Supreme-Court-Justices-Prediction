justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
nager--
--how
about--
--mr.
nager,
aren't
there
two
differences
between
the
problem
we
have
in
this
case...
and
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer...
and
the
problem
in
the
pregnancy
discrimination
case.
first
of
all,
that
statute
didn't
have
a
comparable...
anything
comparable
to
402(b)
in
it.
and
secondly,
that
is...
was
a
one-shot
provision.
it
just
had
one
particular
change.
here
there
are
a
host
of
changes.
and
i
think...
and
you've
suggested
that
one
might
read
this
statute
as
contemplating
retroactivity
for
some
of
the
changes,
such
as
the
expert
witness
fee
provision
and
such
as
the
attack
on
consent
decrees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
position
is
there
is
no
retroactivity,
even,
for
example,
on
the
consent
decree
provision,
that
applies
only
to
future
consent
decrees,
not
to
future
attacks
on
previously
entered
consent
decrees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
your
view
on
whether
it
would
attack...
whether
it
would
apply
to
a
future
lawsuit
challenging
the
validity
of
a
prior
dissent
decree
on
the
ground
that
the
litigant
didn't
have
adequate
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
ground
of
the
lawsuit
is
that
he...
at
the
time
the
consent
decree
was
entered
the
plaintiff
had
not
had
adequate
notice.
that
depends
on
whether
the
retroactivity
is
a...
applies
to
conduct
or
applies
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
retroactivity
problem
is
complicated
because
there
are
a
variety
of
provisions
in
here
with
respect
to
which
one
could
at
least
argue
that
there
is
some
kind
of
retroactivity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
nager,
apparently
congress
thought
we'd
misapplied
the
presumptions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nager,
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
there's
any...
you
were
asked
about
the
civil
rights
restoration
act
of
1987,
the
grove
city...
sequel
to
grove
city.
the
preamble
of
that
statute
says
that
congress
wanted
to
restore
prior
executive
interpretation,
that
the
courts
had
relied
on
restoration.
is
there
any
sense
of
restoration
involved
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is...
what
is
the
underlying...
what
is
the
underlying
value
that
makes
this
presumption
so
important?
isn't
it
the
concept
of
fair
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
else
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there's
no
question
here
that
if
congress
had
made
it's
intent
clear,
it
would
have
had
the
power
to
make
the
statute
retroactive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
also
made
the
same
point
in
my
dissent
in
daubert
against
florida.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
kind
of
cuts
against
you
a
little
bit.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nager,
it
is
perfectly
clear,
isn't
it,
that
if
they
had
made
their
intent
perfectly
clear
we
would
have
followed
it?
so
they
have
a
clear
rule
already.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we'd
said
it
in
different
language,
do
you
think
they
still
might
have
just
compromised
this
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
each
side
well
knew
that
if
they
put
in
language
as
they
had
in
the
1990
statute,
there
wouldn't
have
been
much
of
a
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991
is
a
major
piece
of
federal
legislation.
when
it
enacted
that
statute,
congress
provided
additional
remedies
for
civil
rights
violations
and
affectively
overruled
seven
of
this
court's
decisions
interpreting
earlier
civil
rights
statute.
despite
the
importance
of
the
legislation
and
unlike
the
1990
version
of
the
statute
which
president
bush
had
vetoed,
the
1991
act
is
silent
on
the
question
whether
most
of
its
provisions
apply
to
cases
that
arose
before
november
19,
1991,
the
date
the
statue
became
affective.
the
two
cases,
that
i
have
to
announce
this
morning,
present
questions
concerning
the
retroactivity
of
two
sections
of
the
act.
the
landgraf
case,
which
comes
to
us
from
the
fifth
circuit,
involves
section
102
which
creates
a
right
to
recover
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
for
certain
violations
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
it
further
provides
that
any
party
may
demand
a
trial
by
jury
if
such
damages
are
sought.
the
rivers
case,
which
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
involves
section
101
which
expands
the
scope
of
the
1866
civil
rights
act's
prohibition
against
racial
discrimination
in
the
making
and
enforcement
of
contracts.
in
each
of
these
cases,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
statutory
provision
at
issue
should
not
be
applied
retroactively.
the
principal
submission
of
both
petitioners
is
based
on
the
text
of
the
act.
they
argue
that
the
expressed
preclusion
of
retroactive
application
in
two
sections
of
the
act
gives
rise
to
a
negative
implication
that
congress
intended
the
remainder
of
the
act
to
apply
to
pending
cases
that
arose
before
the
act
was
passed.
although
this
argument
has
some
force,
it
seems
implausible
to
us
that
congress
would
resolve
the
important
matter
of
retroactivity
through
negative
inferences.
we
ultimately
reject
the
argument
relying
in
part
on
legislative
history
disclosing
that
congress
omitted
from
the
1991
act
the
kind
of
explicit
retroactivity
provision
that
it
had
included
in
the
1990
bill
that
was
vetoed
by
president
bush.
because
the
text
of
the
1991
act
does
not
resolve
the
retroactivity
issues,
we
rest
our
decisions
on
judicial
presumptions
governing
the
temporal
reach
of
statutes.
a
presumption
against
statutory
retroactivity
has
deep
roots
in
our
jurisprudence.
in
decisions
spanning
two
centuries,
the
court
has
declined
to
interpret
new
statutes
so
as
to
impose
new
legally
disadvantages
on
past
acts
unless
congress
clearly
intended
that
result.
we
are
not
satisfied
that
the
presumption
reach
retroactivity
applies
to
the
provisions
at
issue
in
the
landgraf
case.
although
employment
discrimination
has
been
forbidden
since
long
before
1991,
the
new
damages
remedies
of
the
1991
act
attached
new
legal
burdens
to
a
title
vii
violation.
if
applied
to
conduct
occurring
before
their
enactment,
the
new
damages
provisions
would,
thus,
operate
retroactively.
moreover,
because
the
new
jury
trial
right
is
only
available
for
plaintiffs
seeking
damages,
that
provision
likewise
applies
only
in
cases
arising
after
november
21,
1991.
in
the
rivers
case,
the
petitioners
advance
an
argument
that
was
not
available
in
landgraf.
they
contend
that
section
101
of
the
1991
act
applies
to
pending
cases
because
congress
unquestionably
intended
to
overrule
this
court's
construction
of
the
1866
act
in
patterson
against
mclean
credit
union,
and
to
restore
the
broader
understanding
of
the
law
that
had
prevailed
in
the
courts
of
appeals
before
paterson
was
decided.
we
disagree
with
that
submission.
when
congress
responds
to
a
judicial
decision,
it
may
wish
to
make
the
responding
statute
retroactive
in
order
to
limit
the
effects
of
a
ruling
with
which
it
disagrees.
however,
congress'
decision
to
overrule
one
of
their
cases
does
not
of
itself
demonstrate
an
intent
to
legislate
retroactively.
clear
evidence
of
a
specific
legislative
intention
to
make
the
new
statute
retroactive
is
still
required.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
each
of
these
cases.
justice
scalia,
joined
by
justices
kennedy
and
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
and
justice
blackmun
has
filed
dissenting
opinions
in
both
cases.
