mr.
schnapper,
there...
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
maxims
of
construction
and
it's
not
unusual
for
the
maxims
to
cut
against
one
another,
and
in
those
cases
i
guess
you
have
to
decide
which
one
is
stronger.
now,
i
had
thought
that
we
have
a
very
strong
rule...
i'm
not
even
sure
it's...
it's
at
as
low
a
level
as
a
maxim
of
construction,
but
a
rule
that
retroactivity
is
disfavored.
i
mean,
we
have
some
state
constitutions
that
specifically
prohibit
retroactive
legislation.
it's
a
long
tradition
of
the
common
law.
why
shouldn't
we
say,
well,
in
an
ordinary
case
these
minor
indications
of
meaning
would
suffice,
but
they
don't
suffice
to
overcome
the
strong
presumption
against
retroactive
legislation,
you
have
to
say
it
clearly?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
say
this
is
clear,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
into
it,
you
say
that
have
traditionally
been
applied.
where
was
the
bradley
rule
traditionally
applied
before
bradley?
justice
antonin
scalia
express...
was
it
ever
expressed
before
bradley?
do
you
have
a
case
that
expresses
bradley
before
bradley?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
do
you
have
to
make
that
exception?
isn't
it
a
more
sensible
way
to
simply
ask
the
question
that
once
you've
decided
that
you
have
a
general
principle
against
retroactivity,
you
still
have
to
ask
yourself
what
is
the...
what
is
the
baseline
for
retroactivity?
what
is
the
event
that
determines
whether
it's
being
retroactive
or
not?
and
its
not
being
retroactive
with
respect
to
most
procedural
rules
simply
because
the
event
is
the
trial,
and
therefore
any
trial
that
occurs
after
the
legislation
uses
the
new
procedure.
that's
not...
that's
not
rendering
it
retroactive
at
all.
whereas
most
substantive
rules,
including...
including
the
amount
of
damages,
the
base
line,
the
point
of
reference
is
not
the
trial
but
rather
the
action
which
is
being
punished
by
or
compensated
by
that
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
wouldn't
have
to
make
an
arbitrary
exception
to
that
principle,
as
you
have
had
to
make
it
for
your
substantive
procedural
distinction.
you
make
a
substantive
procedural
distinction
but
then
you
say
well,
of
course,
where
the
trial
has
already
occurred.
well,
why
make
that
exception?
mr.
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
any
different
from
increasing
the
criminal
penalty
for
an
action
that's
already
criminal?
would
you
say
that
that's
retroactive?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why,
because
it's
retroactive?
because
it's
retroactive,
but
you
say
it
somehow
is
not
retroactive
in
civil
cases
even
though
it
obviously
is
in
criminal.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
what
ex
post
facto...
that's
what
the
ex
post
facto
law
is
directed
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
slipped
their
mind.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
distinction
between
substance
and
procedure
is
not
a
very
clear
one
either,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
presumption
that
you're
referring
to,
mr.
nager,
i
gather
is
not
just
an
interpretative
presumption.
it's...
unlike
many
presumptions
which
are
just,
you
know,
given
no
other
indication,
the
normal
interpretation
is
thus
and
so,
this
is
something
of
a
substantive
presumption.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
it's
clear
that
if
they
make
it
clear
we
will
follow
it.
[laughter]
but
it
isn't
clear
that
if
they
don't
make
it
clear,
we
won't
follow
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
the...
what
the
one-upsmanship
was
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
especially
when
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
imposes
vicarious
liability...
that
is
to
say,
we're
not
talking
about
employers
who
personally
discriminate.
but
the
issue
is
how
much
effort
must
they
expend
to
be
sure
that
none
of
their
employees
is
guilty
of
such
discrimination.
obviously,
how
much
effort
the
republic
excepts
from
them
depends
to
some
extent
upon
the
sanctions
that
the
republic...
the
republic
is
imposing
for
their
failure
to
shape
up.
don't
you
think
that
there's...
there's
a...
that
it's
an
intelligent
decision
for
a
businessman
to
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think...
never
mind.
