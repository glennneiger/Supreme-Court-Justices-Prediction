i
don't
think
that
the
civil
rights
overturned
our
decision.
it
simply
recognized
that
congress
had
passed
a
statute
which
was
broken
and
that
it
ought
to
be
fixed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
very
fundamental
distinction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
would
you
apply
that
rule,
mr.
days,
in
the
hypothetical
case,
not
this
statute,
where
the
jury
trial
provisions
are
not
linked
to
the
damages?
suppose
you
have
a
trial
in
which
the
damages
are
assessed
by
the
court
and
then,
pending
appeal,
the
jury
trial
provision
is
enacted?
how
would
you
apply
your
rule
in
that
case?
would
the
plaintiff
be
entitled
to
reversal
for
a
new
trial
before
a
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
would
follow...
then
it
would
follow
that
punitive
damages
are...
serve
no
purpose.
