justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
that
that
applies
to...
so
far
as
you
know,
to
only
one
possible
party?
justice
david
h.
souter
including
punitives?
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
why
is
it...
why
are
punitive
damages
not
a
new
remedy
for
an
old
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
we...
do
we
get
to
presumptions
before
we
get
beyond
the
question
of
plain
language?
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
in
our
struggle
how
do
we
read
out
the
negative
implication
of
109(c)?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me...
in
your
response
would
you
make
a...
maybe
you
don't
want
to
make
this
distinction;
if
you
don't,
you
tell
me.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
plausible
for
you
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
implication
of
402(b),
which
was
apparently,
it
is
agreed,
intended
to
have
application
only
to
one
possible
party
in
one
case...
which
is
a...
you
know,
i
suppose
can
easily
be
characterized
as
just
an
insurance
policy,
it's
a
pretty
bizarre
example...
and
on
the
other
hand,
109(c)
which
doesn't
have
that...
that
narrow
compass
and
does
not
seem
to
be
a
bizarre
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-hum.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
would
grant
you
that
in
the
absence
of
(c)
it
certainly
would
be
ambiguous,
but
it
is
also
very
clear,
as
your
brother
pointed
out,
that
it
begins
by
referring
to
an
exception
so
that
it
seems
to
have
been
drafted
with
just
such
an
exception
as
109(c)
in
mind,
which
seems
to
me,
if
anything,
to
underline
the
implication
of
(c).
it
seems
to
me
a
strong
implication.
justice
david
h.
souter
before
we
get
into
that,
can...
would
you
tell
me,
what
is
the
analogue
in
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
that
you're...
you're
arguing
from
to
section
109(c)?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't...
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
argument,
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
i
mean
you
say
that.
it's
a...
it
seems
pretty
clear
negative
inference.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
well,
is
the
rule
that
you
think
we
should
follow
or,
indeed,
that
perhaps
we
have
followed,
is
that
a
negative
inference
will
never
suffice?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
certainly
get
you
where
you
want
to
go.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
nager,
you're
not
arguing,
are
you,
that
there
would
be
a
separation
of
powers
problem
in
any
application
short
of
attacking
a
final
judgment
of
the
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
go...
do
you
go
the
whole
hog
with
your
argument
and
say
that
also
applies
to
the
new
punitive
damage
provisions?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
it,
$300,000?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you'd
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
