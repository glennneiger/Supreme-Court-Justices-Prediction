mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
would
no
doubt
be
easier
if
in
the
1991
civil
rights
act
congress
had
directly
and
specifically
addressed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
sections
101
and
102
of
the
civil
rights
act
were
to
be
applied
retroactively
to
conduct
that
occurred
5
years
before
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
was
a
heavily
debated
issue,
no
doubt,
and...
but
they
didn't
specifically
address
it,
and
the
question
for
this
court
is
what
rule
of
construction
applies
in
a
case
where
congress
has
not
specifically
addressed--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
what
the
court
in
reynolds
held,
and,
of
course,
it
was
wrong.
and
the
reason
it
was
wrong
is
because
it
started
in
the
wrong
place.
this
court
has
made
clear
for
over
200
years
that
the
starting
point
in
a
case
involving
a
question
of
retroactivity
is
a
presumption.
it's
a
presumption
that
courts
should--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes,
justice
souter,
i
think
we
do.
ever
since
schooner
peggy
the
court
has
instructed
the
court
should
struggle
hard
to
avoid
retroactive
interpretations
of
the
law,
that
the
presumption
of
prospectivity
protects
fundamental
values
of
justice
and
limited
government
through
checks
and
balances
that
are
fundamental
to
this
nation's
legal
tradition
and
to
its
constitutional
structure.
it--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
reading
it
out,
justice
souter.
there's
no
doubt
that
there
is
a
plausible
inference
from
those
sections
that
one
plausible
construction
of
402(a)
is
that
congress
intended
it
to
apply
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
retroactively,
but
it's
not
the
only
conceivable
inference.
and
the
important
question
that
the
court
has
to
ask
is
what
standard
of
clarity
does
congress
have
to
meet
in
order
to
compel
the
courts
to
do
what
this
court
has
historically
instructed
the
courts
to
not
do,
to
not
apply
a
statute
retroactively.
and
this
isn't
the
only
presumption
that
this
court
has
at
that
time.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
the
justice
is
correct
in
that
the
two
provisions
are
different.
402(b)
is
different
because
it
prohibits
both
a
retroactive
application
of
the
statute
and
a
prospective
application
of
the
statute.
402(b)
says
no
provision
of
this
act
will
apply
to
that
case.
so,
for
example,
section
1113
of
the
statute,
which
provides...
creates
the
right
for
expert
fees
in
civil
rights
cases,
that
provision,
absent
the
way
402(b)
was
written,
could
have
applied
to
the
wards
cove
case
on
remand
with
respect
to
future
proceedings.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
the...
so
essentially
402(b)
is
a
grandfathering
provision.
now,
i...
again,
109(c)
is
different.
it
just
talks
about
conduct
occurring
after
the
date
of
enactment.
that's
what
section
109(c)
becomes
applicable
to.
but
we
can't
ignore
either
the
presumption
that
i've
discussed
or
the
language
of
402(a)
itself.
that
language
is
ambiguous
and
it
elicits--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
in...
the
justice
has
agreed
with
me
that
section
402(b)
prohibits
both
retroactive
and
prospective
effects,
so
to
the
extent
that
402(a)
starts
with
except...
with
a
qualification
on
its
language,
it
easily
picks
up
402(b)
without
making
any
reference
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
or
not
402(a)
is
only
a
prospectivity
provision
or
a
retroactivity
provision
as
well
as
a
prospectivity
provision.
the
important
point
here
is
twofold.
one
is
that
the
language
of
402(a)
is
language
that
congress
has
used
before.
and
that
language
has
been
routinely
construed
by
the
lower
courts
as
allowing
only
prospective
effect
for
a
statute.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
congress,
in
the
1978
amendments
to
title
vii
and
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
which
changed
the
rule
of
law
that
this
court
had
announced
in
gilbert
v.
general
electric.
in
section
a
of
the
1978
effective
date
sections
said:
"except
as
provided
in
subsection
(b),
this
act
shall
take
effect
on
the
date
of
enactment.
"
and
in
subsection
(b)
said
that
the
1978
amendments
would
not
become
effective
as
to
benefit
plans
in
existence
on
the
date
on
enactment
until
after
180
days
had
passed.
so...
and
the
second
circuit
and
one
other
court
of
appeals
which
is
slipping
my
mind
at
this
point
but
is
cited
in
our
brief,
construed
the
1978
amendments
to
only
allow
prospective
application
of
the
statute
in
all
respects;
prospective
delayed
for
6
months
for
benefit
plans
in
existence,
prospective
for
conduct
occurring
after
the
date
of
enactment
for
everything
else.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
there
are
cases
from
this
court
dealing,
quite
frankly,
with
much
more
complicated
and
difficult
cases.
for
example,
schwab
v.
doyle
is
a
case
in
which
congress
had
passed
a
transfer
tax
under
the
estate
tax
laws
saying
that
in
any
transaction
whatsoever
that
a
transfer
tax
would
be
placed
on
that
transaction,
so
that
a
person
before
their
death
couldn't
reduce
the
size
of
their
estate.
and
this
court
said
that
while
certainly
it
was
one
plausible
construction
of
that
statute
to
say
that
it
applied
to
any
transaction
that
an
individual
had
entered
into
before
their
death
to
reduce
the
size
of
their
estate...
this
court
said
it
is
possible
to
read
the
statute
to
only
apply
to
transactions
occurring
after
the
date
of
enactment
and
before
an
individual's
death,
and
that
the
transfer
tax
would
only
apply
to
those
reductions...
transactions
which
reduced
the
size
of
an
individual's
estate.
again,
the
point
here
is
that
this
court
has
historically
said
the
courts
should
avoid
retroactive
applications
of
the
law.
there
is
a
historic
bias--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--against
retroactive
applications
of
the
law.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
have
to
concede
to
the
justice
that
i
haven't
read
the
language
of
the
civil
rights
act...
civil
rights
restoration
act
of
'87.
i
do
know
the
courts
of
appeals
have
split
on
whether
or
not
that
statute
could
be
applied
to
cases
that
were
pending
or
concerning
conduct
that
arose
before
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
that
statute.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no.
i
think,
in
fact,
the
closest
to
the
patterson
situation
is
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
rejected
the
rule
of
law,
the
interpretation
of
the
preexisting
title
vii
scheme
announced
by
this
court
in
general
electric
v.
gilbert.
and
general
electric
v.
gilbert,
as
the
dissent
pointed
out,
rejected
the
unanimous
views
of
six
court
of
appeals
and
the
eeoc's
position
on
whether
or
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
constituted
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
disability.
and
congress
rejected
this
court's
interpretation
as
of
what
the
law
should
be,
enacted
a
new
rule
of
law
that
provided
for
a
effective
date
using
general
language
identical
to
the
general
effective
date
language
in
this
statute.
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
applying
different
methodologies,
to
be
sure,
than
methodologies
that
other
courts
have
applied...
because
there
is
some
confusion...
a
considerable
amount
of
confusion
in
the
courts
of
appeals
as
to
what
methodology
to
apply
given
the
tension
that
exists
in
this
court's
cases,
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
majerno
case.
but
they
have
all
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
that
statutes
containing
general
effective
date
language,
as
this
statute
contains,
should
be
construed
to
have
only
prospective
effect.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i'm...
apologies
if
i
have
been
unclear,
justice
stevens.
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
civil
rights
act
can
in
any
way
properly
be
construed
as
having
retroactive
applications--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--it
applies...
that
provision,
just
like
the
expert
witness
fees
provision,
would
apply
to
any
event
occurring
after
the
date
of
enactment.
so
that
if...
we'd
have
to
go
through
the
specific
provisions
of
section
108,
which
is
a
section
dealing
with
consent
decrees.
it
deals
with
rights
of
intervention,
it
deals
with
notice
issues
with
respect
to
consent
decrees.
and
the
expert
witness
fee
example--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
question
is
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
section
108?
mr.
glen
d.
nager
with
respect
to
that
future
lawsuit,
the
law...
if
the
lawsuit
was
challenging
the
validity
of
the
consent
decree,
it
would
have
to
meet
the
requirements
of
section
108
in
order
to
be
properly
filed,
because
section
108
sets
forth
the
terms
upon
which
such
a
lawsuit
can
be
filed.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
you've
picked
a
tough
example
and
i'm
hesitating
not
because
i
don't
know
the
right
methodology
to
apply,
but
because
i
can't...
i
don't
have...
i'm
not
looking
at
each
provision
of
the
statute.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
point
is
easily
conceded
by
me
that
this
is
not
an
easy
question
even
if
one
knows
what
the
right
starting
point
is.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
true,
justice
scalia,
and
i
appreciate
that
help.
[laughter]
mr.
glen
d.
nager
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
no
analogue
and--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
because
one
still
has
to
ask...
there's
still
the
language
of
402(a)
and
there's
still
the
presumption
of
prospectivity.
and
my
first
point
to
you,
justice
souter,
would
be
that
negative
inferences
are
not
enough.
this
court
in...
with
regard
to
both
this
presumption
and
a
number
of--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--because
this
court's
decisions
have
stated
over
and
over
and
over
again,
it
has
to
be
a
clear
and
unequivocal
command
for
retroactivity
that
congress
has
set
forth.
let
me
use
an
example
using--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes,
that
is
what
we
would
suggest
to
the
court,
that
congress
has
to
either
expressly--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
part
of
my
objective,
if
not
my
entire
objective.
but
let
me
give
an
analogy.
this
court
in
the
aramco
decision,
a
decision
which
109...
section
109
of
the
civil
rights
act
changes
the
rule
for
whether
or
not
title
vii
applies
overseas.
in
that
case
there
were
negative
inferences.
there
was
an
alien
exemption
in
the
statute,
and
from
that
one
side
in
that
case
argued
will,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
need
to
put
an
alien
exemption
in
the
statute
if
the
statute
didn't
apply
to
u.s.
citizens
overseas,
because
the
alien
exemption
says
title
vii
doesn't
apply
to
aliens
who
are
working
overseas.
but
as
the
court...
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
for
the
court,
and
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion,
that
wasn't
enough
to
overcome
the
presumption
for
the
extra
application
against
application
of
u.s.
laws
overseas.
if
that
presumption
isn't
overcome
by
negative
inferences,
it
would
certainly
seem
that
this
presumption,
which
certainly
forms
the
most
essential
starting
point
for
statutory
constructions...
this
court
over
and
over
again
has
said
it
is
the
first
principle
of
statutory
construction...
that
negative
inferences
from
109(c)
would
not
be
enough,
and
it
shouldn't
be
enough.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
congress
has
the
right
to
change
the
rules,
as
it
clearly
has.
this
court's
job,
of
course,
is
not
to
try
to
figure
out
what
the
current
congress
would
like
the
law
to
be.
this
job...
this
court
is
presented
with
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
enacted
by
prior
congresses.
and
when
this...
a
subsequent
congress
enacts
a
new
law,
as
it
clearly
has
the
right
to
do,
it
also
has
the
right
to
specify,
if
it
feels
that
strongly
about
it,
that
it
should
make
the
effective
date
retroactive.
but
it
has
to
say
so
and
congress
did
not
here.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
not.
in
fact,
there
were...
the
preliminary
bills
for
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991
used
identical
language
to
that:
to
respond
to
supreme
court
decisions
rendered
under
title
vii
and
to
restore
the
law
to
what
it
was.
and
if
one
reads
the
legislative
history,
for
whatever
it's
worth,
it
does
account
for
some
history,
and
here
there
was
a
bitter
struggle
between
the
bush
administration
and
the
democratic
leaders
in
the
senate
and
in
the
house
over
whether
or
not
changes
in
the
law
to
which
they
agreed
should
be
characterized
as
restorative
or
not.
but
the
other
point
i'd
make
to
you,
justice
stevens,
is
it's
really
not
a
determinative
factor
what
a
law
is
characterized
as.
the
question
should
be
whether
or
not
congress
has
commanded
that
even
a
restorative
law
be
applied
retroactively
or
not.
it
may
be
that
restorative
laws
are
those
kinds
of
laws
in
which
congress
is
going
to
be
more
likely
on
occasion
to
make
those...
to
meet
this
court's
test.
but
there's
no
reason
to
lower
the
standard
just
because
congress
may
on
those
occasions
rise
up
and
say
notwithstanding
the
fundamental
principles
of
justice
that
underlie
the
traditional
presumption,
notwithstanding
our
historic
suspicion
of
legislatures
enacting
retroactive
rules,
that
these
are
occasions
on
which
other
values,
values
that
our
society
has
now
come
to
agreement
upon,
should
override
the
presumption
in
those
particular
circumstances.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
this
statute
doesn't
say
that,
though.
this
statute,
in
fact,
does
not
say
it's
going
to
restore
the
law.
it
says
in
responding
to
supreme
court
decisions,
congress
is
going
to
expand
the
law.
so
to
the
extent
we
are
looking,
in
fact,
at
the
findings
and
purposes
provisions
of
the
two
statutes,
they're
different.
we
should
also--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes,
although
i'd
reiterate
the
point
that
i
made
to
justice
stevens,
that
congress'
purpose
in
restoring
the
law,
while
it
may
provide
a
suggestion
of
an
intention
for
retroactivity,
is
not
sufficient
to
create
a
retroactive
effective
date.
congress
has
to
say
so
clearly.
and
this
was
the
point
of
the
tenth
circuit,
which
is
the
circuit
that
i
do
remember,
under
the
'87
statute,
which
rejected
the
call
for
retroactivity
of
that
statute
even
though
it
had
the
benefit
of
the
second
circuit's
views
and
the
fifth
circuit's
views
on
holding
that
statute
retroactive.
the
point,
again,
is
that
we...
the
starting
point
for
the
analysis
is
we
will
struggle
hard,
in
the
words
of
the
schooner
peggy
court,
to
avoid
a
retroactive
application
of
the
law.
that's
possible
here
and
with...
if
the
justice
will
allow
me,
i'll
let
someone
else
argue
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
under
the
'87
statute,
but
my
reading
of
those
cases
would
be
that
i
would
be
taking
the
same
position
if
i
were
arguing
that
statute,
except
i
can't
remember
the
effective
date
provisions
of
that
statute
well
enough.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
so,
although
i'm
hesitant
to...
in
this
particular
case,
to
make
distinctions
between
substantive
presumptions
and
interpretative
presumptions.
[laughter]
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
in...
part
of
it
is
the
concept
of
fair
notice.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
is
the
notion
that
in
this
country,
with
our
separation
of
powers
between
the
legislative
branch
and
the
judicial
branch
and
the
executive
branch,
that
the
power
to
look
backwards
to
interpret
preexisting
law
and
apply
preexisting
law
lies
with
the
courts,
and
that
the
presumption
with
respect
to
the
legislative
branch
is
that
it
looks
forward,
not
backwards.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
true.
but
i
have
to
put
a
slight
qualification
on
that
that
i...
we
find
the
punitive-damages
provision
troubling.
this
court
in
turner
elkhorn
said
that
it
would
have
a
hard
time,
under
the
due
process
clause,
sustaining
a
law
whose
purpose
was
retroactively
to
blame...
be
based
on
blameworthiness
principles
or
deterrence
principles.
and,
of
course,
this
statute
talks
about
deterrence,
but
you
can't
deter
something
that's
already
happened.
so--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no.
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
trying
to
answer
the
question
of
where
does
the
substance
come
from
that...
that
has
led
the
courts
to
create
this
presumption,
whether
one
calls
it
a
substantive
canon
as
opposed
to
an
interpretative
canon.
and
as
i
have
read
the
historical
materials,
as
i
have
read
this
court's
cases,
it's...
it
has
essentially
based
it
on
two
fundamental
parts
of
the
american
legal
tradition.
the
one,
as
the
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
people
are
entitled
to
fair
notice
of
the
law,
they're
entitled
to
fair
notice
of
its
sanctions,
and
that
we
will
struggle
hard
to
avoid
the
application
to
them
of
any
law,
of
any
sanction
that
they
haven't
had
fair
notice
of.
the
second
substantive
background
value
that
has
informed
the
presumption
and
given
it
weight...
and,
justice
stevens,
you
refer
to
this
yourself
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
croson
case...
is
that
we
have
a
suspicion
in
this
country
that
legislatures
can
be
vindictive.
they
can
act
for
noble
purposes,
they
can
act
for
vindictive
purposes,
but
when
they're
acting
looking
backwards
we
need
to
be
especially
concerned
and
especially
suspicious.
and
it's
that--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that
is--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that
is
true,
but
the...
of
course,
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion
and
it
was
not
about
what
informs
this
presumption.
[laughter]
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i'm
not
making
that
argument
because
i
don't
think
that
we
need
to.
i
have
three
points
to
say
to
you,
justice
ginsburg.
to
the
extent
that
it
was
illegal
to
discriminate,
either
on
the
basis
of
race
in
the
roadway
case
or
to
have
unlawful
sexual
harassment
in
the
workplace,
the
roadway
defendants
were
vindicated
repeatedly
in
the
district
court
as
to
not
have
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
as
the
justices
pointed
out,
the
judgment
entered
in
the
landgraf
case
was
a
take-nothing
judgment
against
the
plaintiff.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
finding
was
that
there
was
sexual
harassment
occurring
in
the
workplace,
but
there
was
also
another
finding
that
the
employer,
usi
film
products,
had
redressed
that
situation.
so
that,
in
fact,
the
remedy
that
the
1964
congress
wanted
happened.
the
1964
congress,
in
contrast
to
the
1991
congress,
wanted
to
encourage
employers
to
fix
the
situations
themselves.
and
this
employer
did
that.
maybe
not
as
fast
as
we
would
have
liked,
and
maybe
the
next
time
it'll
do
it
better.
and
one
of
the...
no
doubt
one
of
the
effects
of
the
1991
statute...
because
i
now
have
clients
calling
me
asking
me
to
put
on
sexual
harassment
training
seminars
that
weren't...
we
didn't
use
to
put
on
for
our
clients,
is
for
them
to
increase
their
training
efforts,
increase
their
monitoring
efforts,
increase
their
education
efforts
so
that
they
can
train
their
employees
both
not
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
or
sex,
not
to
have
sexually
harassment
work
forces,
to
respond
effectively
to
employee
complaints.
but
please
do
remember
that
the
employers
in
this
case,
a,
have
not
been
adjudicated
of
violating
any
law,
discriminating
unlawfully.
and,
in
fact,
it's
always...
not
always,
but
in
these
two
cases,
as
it
is
in
many
cases,
these
are
cases
in
which
the
employers
are
simply
being
held
vicariously
liable.
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
1964
congress
understood
and
the
1991
congress
understood
that
the
level
of
the
sanctions
that
are
attached
to
the
law
informed
the
judgments
made
by
american
employers
as
to
how
much
money
to
put
into
the
investment
to
ensure
that
other
people
don't
discriminate.
discrimination
is
wrong.
it's
illegal.
when
it's
found
to
have
occurred...
as
it
has
not
been,
there's
no
judgment
finding
any
discrimination
in
either
of
these
cases.
there
are
factual
findings
in
the
landgraf
case.
i
concede
that
sexual
harassment
existed
in
the
workplace.
but
there's
also
a
finding
in
the
district
court
opinion,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
human
resources
manager
responded
to
that
situation
and
fixed
it.
i'd
like...
one
final
point
to
make
to
the
court.
this
was
a
political
compromise,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out.
this
was
not
an
issue
that
slipped
through.
this
was
vigorously
debated.
and
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
civil
rights
act
but
for
the
fact
that
senator
danforth
and
senator
rudman
and
senator
domenici
and
six
other
moderate
republicans
said
if
we're
going
to
have
a
civil
rights
bill,
people
are
going
to
have
to
make
some
compromises.
and
they
forged
a
compromise
and
they
ended
up
with
ambiguous
statutory
language.
and
they
ended
up
stitching
together
a
few
bills
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
has
pointed
out,
contain
redundancies
that
we
can't
get
out
of
the
statute
any
way
we
read
it,
no
matter
what
presumptions
we
apply.
and
we
had
a
lot
of
self-serving
floor
statements.
if
congress...
what
congress
needs
from
this
court
is
clear
direction.
what
is
the
rule
that
the
court
is
going
to
apply
when
congress
doesn't
say
whether
or
not
it
intends
a
retroactive
effect
of
the
law?
congress
needs
a
rule
that
it
can
understand,
that's
simple
to
apply,
and
so
do
the
lower
courts.
they're
in
terrible
confusion.
and
if
respect
for
the
compromise
that
was
struck
in
1991--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
true.
but
there's
also--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--justice
stevens,
there
are
clearly
floor
statements
from
people
on
both
sides
citing
different
decisions
coming
out
of
this
court
to
try
to...
to
create,
essentially,
a
manipulated
record
for
the
lower
courts
to
apply.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
true.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
true
too.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
