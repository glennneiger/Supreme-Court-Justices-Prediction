mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
one
of
the
two
cases,
mr.
schnapper,
the
right
to
jury
trial
is
involved,
isn't
it?
chief

in
landgraf,
right.
that
right
to
jury
trial
is
inseparable
from
the
substantive
right
to
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
congress
had
done
just
the
opposite
of
what
it
did
here?
supposing
before
the
most
recent
act
there
had
been
a
right
to
jury
trial
and
afterwards
the
congress
says
no,
there's
no
longer
a
jury
trial,
and
the
plaintiff
had
already
had
a
jury
trial
in
which
she'd
been
awarded
damages,
would
you
say
then
that
under...
the
new
act
would
apply
and
the
jury
trial
would
be
cancelled
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
claiming
you
should
go
back
and
be
able
to
have
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
they
wouldn't
have
done
before
the
act
was
amended.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
schnapper.
general
days,
we'll

you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
mr.
nager,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
mr.
schnapper,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schnapper.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
