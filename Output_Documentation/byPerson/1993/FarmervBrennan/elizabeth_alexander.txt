ms.
elizabeth
alexander
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
transsexual.
she
is
a
young,
nonviolent
prisoner
of
feminine
appearance
and
demeanor.
prior
to
her
incarceration,
she
had
undergone
silicone
breast
injections
and
unsuccessful
surgery
to
remove
her
testicles.
she
alleges
that
she
was
raped
approximately
10
days
after
her
placement
in
general
population
at
the
terre
haute
penitentiary.
rape
is
one
of
the
most
painful
and
humiliating
things
that--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--yes,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
is
currently
confined
at
fci
florence
in
florence,
colorado.
this
is
a
medium
security
facility.
she
is
in
general
population
at
that
medium
security
facility.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
she
is
seeking
two
things.
she
is
seeking
damages
from
the
respondents.
she
is
also
seeking--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--yes,
your
honor.
she--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--your
honor,
we
would
argue
that
they...
that
their
actions
did
cause
that
placement,
and
i
will...
i
will
get
to
that.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
she
is
also
seeking
an
injunction
to
prevent
her
return
to
a
penitentiary.
that
is
the
injunctive
relief
that
is
sought
in
this
case.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
not
to
a
different
facility,
to...
to
another
penitentiary
such
as
terre
haute.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
she...
where
she
is
is
not
inconsistent
with...
with
the
injunctive
relief
she
seeks,
because
it's...
this
would,
again,
become
relevant
on
remand
should
the
government
seek
to...
again,
to
transfer
her
to
a
penitentiary.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
your
honor,
after
sentencing
she
was...
she
was
eligible
for
confinement
either
in
a
penitentiary
or
in
a
federal
correctional
institution,
within
that...
the
whole
range
of
bureau
of
prisons
facilities.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
there
are...
they
have
a
different
security
level
system
in
general
in
that
penitentiaries
are
the...
the...
traditionally
the
higher
security
facilities.
marion
is
a
highest
security
facility
within
the
federal
system.
leavenworth,
atlanta,
the
former
atlanta
facility,
those
are
other
penitentiaries,
as
is
terre
haute.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
i'm
not
certain
that's
true.
what
i
can...
what
i
can
imagine
is
a
situation
in
which
the
petitioner
would
be
able
to
prove
that
the...
the
risk
was
obvious
that
placement,
again
in
terre
haute
or
in
leavenworth
or
in
another
penitentiary,
would
place
her
at
unreasonable
risk,
and
yet
the
government's
position
was...
was
we
don't
have
actual
knowledge
of
that.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
that
there
can
be
any
generalization.
what
is
a
level
of
violence
is
not...
not
so...
doesn't
so
much
turn
on
the
security
designation
of
the
facility
as
a
particular
atmosphere
and
practices
at
that
facility.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
the
allegation
in
this
case
is
that
the
primary
risk
came
from
the
fact
that
violent
individuals
were
allowed
to
have
access
to
her
in
the
general
population
at
terre
haute.
it
is...
it
is...
the
confinement
of
violent
other
prisoners
that
she
pointed
to
as
a
risk
to
her,
and
that
within
10
days
of
her
placement
in
general
population
at
terre
haute
materialized
in
her
rape.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
i
would
submit
that
she
wanted
a
safe
placement.
she
wanted...
she
would
have
preferred
that
safe
placement
to
have
been
in
general
population.
but
what...
what...
certainly,
she
did
not
want
to
be
raped.
she
wanted
a
safe
placement.
she
has
a
disagreement
with
prison
officials
at
lewisburg
as
to
what
that
safe
placement
would
be.
the
federal
court
agreed,
in
that
case,
with
the
prison
officials
that
the
only
safe
placement
was
in
segregation,
not
in
general
population
at
the
penitentiary.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
is
it
not
the
argument.
the
argument
is
what
is
a
dangerous
facility
has
to
do
with
a
number
of
factors,
the
characteristics
of
the
prisoner...
in
this
case
this
was
a
prisoner
who
was
at
extraordinarily
unusual
risk...
and
the
characteristics
of
the
facility,
the
particular
facility.
if
in
a
facility
with
very
violent
offenders,
inappropriate
and
inadequate
steps
are
taken
to
protect
the
prisoners,
that
is
a
facility
in
which
there
is
extraordinarily
high
risk
of
what
happened
to
this
petitioner.
that
is
within
10
days
of
her
placement,
her
rape.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
not
necessarily.
petitioner--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--whether...
not
necessarily.
it
would
depend
on
the
characteristics
of
the
prisoner
and
the
characteristics
of
general
population
in
that
facility.
petitioner
asks
for
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
this
placement
in
the
general
population
at
terre
haute
violated
the
eighth
amendment
because
it
was
obvious
to
respondents
that
petitioner
was
at
an
unreasonable
risk.
what
does
obvious
risk
mean
in
the
context
of
this
case?
suppose
we
were
making
a
list
of
people
who
would
be
at
obvious
risk
of
sexual
assault
if
placed
in
a
high
security
male
prison.
women
would
be
at
the
top
of
the
list,
surely,
and
the
risk
is
so
obvious
that
we
cannot
imagine
a
prison
deciding
to
confine
women
in
general
population
at
a
male
high
security
facility.
but
also
near
the
top
of
the
list
would
be
someone
who
had
the
appearance
and
demeanor
of
a
woman,
a
transsexual
like
petitioner.
in
the
trial
court
most
of
the
respondents
filed
declarations
denying
actual
knowledge--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--there...
one
could
easily
imagine
a
number
of
facilities
in
which
a
person
as
described
by
your
honor
would
be
at
obvious
and
unreasonable
risk
in
general
population.
on
the
basis
of
the
statements
of
the
respondents
in
the
trial
court
denying
actual
knowledge,
the
trial
court
threw
out
this
complaint
on
summary
judgment
without
allowing
petitioner
an
opportunity
to
conduct
discovery.
this--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--well,
they
knew
this
much.
first
of
all,
two
of
them
filed
declarations
in
which
they
said
they
had
knowledge
about
conditions
at
terre
haute,
in
the
trial
court.
but
they
also
knew...
and
i
think
that
the
transfer
documents
were
in
the
process
of
classification
in
the
bureau
of
prisons,
things
that
ordinarily
are...
their
function
is
to
determine
placement,
their
function
is
have...
to
have
to
do
with
where
the
person
goes.
and
there...
and
therefore
that
what
was
in
those
was
important
to
where...
to
the
actual
placement
of
the
petitioner.
now,
in
the...
in
the
trial
court
the...
the
complaint
was
thrown
out
on
summary
judgment
without
giving
the
petitioner
an
opportunity
to
conduct
discovery
that
would
be
relevant
to
your
honor's
point.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
it
wasn't
an
issue
of
time,
but
perhaps
it
illustrates
the
seventh
circuit's
standard.
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
example
of
the
woman
who
was
placed
in
general
population
at
terre
haute.
under
the
seventh
circuit
standard,
it
would...
if
the
officials
filed
the
same
declarations
that
they
filed
in
this
case,
we
didn't
know
that
she
would
be
an
unreasonable
risk,
that
would
end
the
case
and
that's
wrong.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes,
your
honor.
that
is...
the
standard
that
applies
to
this
case
is
the
deliberate
indifferent
standard
from
wilson
v.
seiter.
that
and--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--well,
i
think
the
change
is
from
the
seventh
circuit
standard
and
how
much
of
the
seventh
circuit
standard
the
government
would
prefer
to
defend
in
this
court.
but
the
government's
standard
is
that
we...
a
plaintiff
must
show
actual
knowledge.
our
stand...
however,
the
government
differs
from
the
seventh
circuit
standard
by
saying
if
the
plaintiff
shows
that
the
risk
was
obvious,
that
can
be
circumstantial
evidence
of
actual
knowledge,
and
that's
a
reasonable
concession
on
the
government's
part.
but
the--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--that's
right.
and...
and
because
of
the
government's
concession
in
this
case,
really
the
issue
now
is
reframed
as
to
what
should
the
lower
courts
in
the
seventh
circuit
do
on
remand
in
this
case.
petitioner
argues
that
deliberate
indifference
exists
when
a
risk
of
serious
and
likely
harm
was
either
known
or
obvious
to
the
defendants,
defendants
had
the
ability
to
forestall
the
harm
but
defendants
nonetheless
failed
to
act.
and
like
respondent's
standard...
again
to
clarify...
this
standard
requires
a
demonstration
that
the
defendants
knew
the
underlying
facts
that
rendered
the
risk
obvious.
unlike
respondent's
standard,
it
does
not
require
proof
that
the
defendants
recognized
an
obvious
risk
when
they
saw
it.
this
is
a
rights
standard
because
inherent
in
the
affirmative
duty
that
prison
officials
owe
to
protect
the
safety
of
those
in
their
care
is
at
least,
at
least
a
duty
to
know
what
is
obvious
to
anyone
in
their
position.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
no,
your
honor.
this
is
a
deliberate
indifference
standard,
word
for
word,
that
comes
from
the
city
of
canton
v.
harris
case.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
your
honor,
it's
not
simply
obvious
risk.
it
is
when
an
obvious
risk
exists
that
the
prison
official
had
the
ability
to
fix
and
then
in
that
situation
did
not
fix.
this
is
not
a
negligence
standard.
indeed,
canton
says
we
don't...
we
don't
apply
negligence,
we
don't
apply
gross
negligence,
it's
only
deliberate
indifference.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
well,
when
you
have
a
prison
official
who
the
essence
of
that
job
is
to
maintain
security
and
order,
and
that...
that
includes...
the
essence
of
the
job
includes
paying
attention
to
risk
factors.
without
basic
minimal
attention
to
the
job,
that
essence
is
gone.
if
in
these
circumstances
prison
officials
do
not
know
what
is
obvious
to
anyone
in
their
position,
then
they
are
oblivious,
callous,
or
uncaring.
they're
deliberately
indifferent.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
i
don't
think
that's
grossly--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
agree--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--yes.
and
the
subjective
element
has
to...
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
always
the
facts
are
viewed
from
the
perspective
of
the
defendant.
but
i
do
agree
with
the
first
part
of
justice
scalia's
question.
i
agree
that
the
court
has
always
treated
deliberate
indifference
as
one
standard,
the
same
standard.
and
that
standard
in
wilson
says
"deliberate
indifference
as
articulated
in
estelle.
"
when
one
looks
at
deliberate
indifference
as
articulated
in
estelle,
one
then
sees,
in
turn,
that
estelle
said
that...
essentially,
here's
a
list
of
lower
court
cases
consistent
with
the
standard
that
we
announce
today.
when
one
reads
through
the
case...
what
those
cases,
in
turn,
use
as
their
standard,
those
cases
are
consistent
with...
with
the
obvious
standard,
they're
not
consistent
with
the
seventh
circuit
standard.
and
also...
that's
also
true
of
canton.
canton
is
a
case
in
this
court
that
gives
the
most
substantial
guidance
as
to
what
deliberate
indifference
means.
canton
is
a
case
that
speaks
of
obvious
risk.
it
is
a
case
that
never
speaks
of
actual
knowledge.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
that...
that
the
court
was
addressing
a
statutory
question,
not
the
question
of
deliberate
indifference.
however,
it
would
seem
odd
if
the
court
were,
without
telling
anyone,
to
2
years
after
it
had
announced...
defined
deliberate
indifference
in
canton,
to
without
saying
it
announce
a
different...
adopt
a
different
deliberate
indifference
standard
in
the
wilson
case.
and
moreover,
there's
another
reason
why
the
deliberate
indifference
standards
appear
to
the
be
same
standards,
and
that
is
if
one
looks
side
by
side
at
the
wilson
case
and
the
canton
case,
there
are
passages
that
are
essentially
parallel
in
the
two
cases.
and
those
passages
have
to
do
with
why
the
court
decides
that
the
deliberate
indifference
standard
is
the
applicable
standard.
the...
in
canton,
the
court
adopted
deliberate
indifference
because
it
said
we...
what
we
need
here
is
a
standard
that
means
that...
that
the
policymakers
were
culpable
enough,
were...
were
making
a
choice
enough
that
it
is
fair
to
give
them
liability
under
monell.
there's
a
parallel
passage
in
wilson
which
says
given
the
state
of
mind
requirement
of
the
eighth
amendment,
we
need
a
standard
that
is...
that
is
deliberate
enough
that
this
standard--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--the
warden
at
terre
haute,
your
honor.
and
this
is...
this
is
also
the
respondent
who,
in
the
lewisburg
case
that
was
referred
to
earlier
in
questioning,
had
filed
a
declaration
that
led
to
the
federal
court
finding
that
it
was...
that
of
course
it's
unsafe
to
put
a
transsexual
in
general
population
at
this
penitentiary.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes,
your
honor.
and
they
said...
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
was
successful
in
federal
court
because
the
federal
court
found
that...
that
the
decision
of
the
officials
that
this
transsexual
should
not
be
in
general
population
was
an
appropriate
decision
for
the
officials
to
make.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
i
would
say
that
that
means
that
there
was
actual
knowledge
on
the
part
of
this
respondents.
of
course,
it
was
not
before...
given
the
dismissal
on
these...
the
face
of
these
declarations,
this
additional
information
about
actual
knowledge
wasn't
available
to
the
trial
court.
and
it
suggests,
of
course,
why
it's
so
important--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--because
the
petitioner
approached,
who
was
proceeding
without
counsel,
didn't
put
that
information
in.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
why
the
respondent
didn't
point
that
out
to
the
court
is,
of
course,
another
issue.
but--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
because
several
of
the
respondents
are
from
oxford,
the
transferring
institution,
which
is
in
the
western
district
of
wisconsin.
so
that's
where
the
petitioner
filed
the
case.
now--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
would
agree
that
on
a
variety
of
levels
the
trial
court
committed
error.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
but
that
error
was
invited
by
the
seventh
circuit
standard--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--i
would
agree
that
it
is
very
possible
that
in
this
case
this
standard
wouldn't
make
a
difference,
because
any
fact
finder
would
infer
from
the
circumstantial
evidence
evidence
of
actual
knowledge.
however,
the
general
standard
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference.
and,
by
the
way,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
our
case
as
a
subject
standard...
an
objective
standard.
ours
is
a
subjective
standard
also
because
it
necessarily
requires--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i'd
like
to
make
another--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--your
honor,
again,
under
our
standard
the
actual
knowledge
simply
isn't
what
the...
the
trier
of
facts
should
focus
on.
it's
the
obviousness
of
the
risk.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
your
honor,
with...
without
having
given
it
a
great
deal
of
thought,
for
which
i
apologize,
as
i
hear
it
it
seems
to
me
that
that...
were
the
court
to
adopt
what
i
think
would
be
the
wrong
standard,
that
indeed
may
well
be
what
it
would
adopt.
and
i
want
to
turn
to
another
point
because
i
think
it's
important
here:
respondents'
attempt
to
defend
their
standard
by
arguing
that
this
case
is
about
the
wide
latitude
that
prison
officials
must
have
in
running
prisons,
and
in
particular
in
making
housing
decisions.
the
concerns
respondents
raise
about
the
complexities
of
decisions
of
prison
staff
are
not
wrong,
but
they're
not
central
to
this
case.
the
respondents'
claim
here
is
that
they
lacked
actual
knowledge
of
an
unreasonable
risk
to
the
petitioner.
according
to
the
transfer
documents
in
the
record,
respondents
didn't
even
consider
petitioner's
transsexuality
when
they
placed
her
in
general
population
in
a
penitentiary,
even
though
the
most
distinctive
fact
about
this
petitioner
is
her
transsexual
status.
you
can't
claim
to
have
considered
a
risk
you
also
say
you
didn't
know
about,
thus
respondents'
denial
of
actual
knowledge
of
the
unreasonable
risk
logically
precludes
them
from
claiming
that
the
placement
was
based
on
a
reasoned
judgment.
thus
this
isn't
a
case
about
deference,
it's
a
case
about
the
proper
standard
under
the
eighth
amendment.
respondents
attempt
to
force
their
standard
into
conformity
with
this
court's
precedent.
this
effort
has
required
that
they
jettison
whole
sections
of
the
seventh
circuit
standard.
even
with
the
remodeling,
the
standard
they--
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
--yes,
your
honor.
there
might
be
some
circumstances
in
which
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
essentially
represented
that
there
wasn't
an
unreasonable
risk
would
render
an
otherwise
obvious
risk
not
obvious,
but
if
the
risk
was
obvious,
then
we
ought
to
think
about
who
has
the
better
information
on
that.
it's...
certainly
the
prison
officials
know...
knew
far
more
about
what
general
population
was
like
at
terre
haute
than
did
the
petitioner.
and
so
it's...
it's
the
wrong
concept
to
think
of
taking
from
the
prison
officials,
who
have
the
information,
the
duty
and
giving
it
to
prisoners
who
don't
have
the
duty
and
also
who
don't
have
the
information.
because
that...
the
notice...
the
requirement
that
you
warn
prison
officials
that
is
so
frequent
in
the
seventh
circuit,
either
the
warning's
superfluous
in
that
they
already
have
the
information
or
you're
required
to
warn
them
about
something
that
you
don't
know
as
a
prison,
something
they're
in
the
better
position
to...
to
address.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
elizabeth
alexander
thank
you,
your
honor.
when
the
government
refers
to
the
record,
of
course
they're
referring
to
a
record
that
we
had
no
opportunity
to
develop
with
regard
to
the
risk
at
terre
haute.
but
i
would
submit,
even
bearing
that
in
mind,
that
whatever
the
general
risk,
if
it's
1
percent,
of
assault
per
year
in
terre
haute,
that
wasn't
this
petitioner's
risk
of
assault.
this
petitioner
was
at
a...
at
an
extraordinarily
high
and
unusual
risk
in
comparison
to
the
background
risk.
and
i'd
like
to...
to
then
turn
to
justice
stevens'
comments
about
the...
what
was
in
the
record,
because
what
is
in
the
record
is
about...
what...
where
the
record
has
some
development
is
about
what
put
this
petitioner
at
risk,
and
that
points
out
something
that's
important
to
bear
in
mind.
both
sides
here
have
a
subjective
standard.
it
is...
because
to
both
sides
actual
knowledge
of
something
is
critical.
to
our
case,
actual
knowledge
is
critical
because
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
risk
that
is
obvious,
that...
because
it
has
to
be
obvious
to
the
defendants,
those
defendants
must
know
the
facts,
must
have
actual
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
make
it
an
obvious
risk.
so
actual
knowledge
plays...
is
central
to
both
cases'
description
of
the
subjective
component.
and
this
also
points
out
to
something
that
is,
i
think,
one
of
the
real
practical
problems,
and
one
of
the
things
that's
wrong
with
the
government's
proposed
standard.
in
this
case
what
is
it
that
the...
that
the
respondents
didn't
know
about
this
petitioner?
presumably
they
would...
they
would...
the
record
seems
to
indicate,
and
at
least
it
is
alleged
that
they
knew
she
was
a
transsexual.
the
answer
says...
this
answer
admits
this
is
a
person
who
projects
feminine
characteristics.
they
knew
she
was
in
general
population
at
terre
haute,
a
penitentiary.
that
they...
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
develop,
they
knew
this
was
a
violent
place
where
a
person
with
the
characteristics
of
petitioner
would
be
assaulted.
they
also,
according
to
petitioner,
knew
transsexuals
were
at
high
risk.
but
yet
the
problem
with
the
government's
standard
is
even
assuming
that
petitioner
had
all
these
allegations
and
therefore
assuming
that
she
would
be
able
to
establish
them,
they
would
still
say
i
knew
these
facts
but
i
didn't
know
that
she
was
at
high
risk.
and
that
is...
that
is
why
it
makes
more
sense
when
one
looks
at
what
is
the
actual
knowledge
that
prison
officials
need
to
have.
it
ought
to
be
actual
knowledge
that
makes
the
risk
obvious,
because
otherwise
it's
always
a
retreating
standard.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
am
concluded.
