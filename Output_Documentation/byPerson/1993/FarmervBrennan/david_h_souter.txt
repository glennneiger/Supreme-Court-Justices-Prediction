justice
david
h.
souter
to
the
extent
that
we're
dealing
with
the
injunction,
the
prisoner
doesn't
suffer
from
the
government's
view
of
the
standard,
i
suppose,
because
the
hearing
is
going
to
be
sufficient
to
prove
knowledge
even
at
the
government's
higher...
slightly
higher
requirement.
so
it's
only
with
respect
to
the...
the
damage
action
for
the
past
harm
that
the
standard
might
make
a
difference,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
the
government
has...
on
the
government's
theory,
the
official
has
got
to
draw
the
conclusion
which
you
say
should
be
inferred
by
any
reasonable
person
from
the
obviousness
of
the
risk,
whereas
under
your
standard
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
the
conclusion
was
actually
drawn,
you
simply
have
to
prove
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
made
it
obvious.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
the
probability
is
a...
is,
in
effect,
an
inference.
i
mean
there
are
facts
and
there
are
inferences
from
them.
the
risk
is
an
inference
which
you
draw
from
the
facts,
and
you're
saying
you've
got
to
prove
that
they
drew
the
inference.
i.e.,
in
the
model
penal
code's
terms,
you've
got
to
prove
that
they
understood
the
high
probability
that
these
facts
implied.
that...
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you're
a
bad
logician,
you
may
have
a
defense.
justice
david

92-7247.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
it
requires
us
to
define
the
term,
"deliberate
indifference".
under
the
eighth
amendment,
prison
officials
have
a
duty
to
ensure
that
prison
inmates
receive
adequate
food,
clothing,
shelter,
and
medical
care,
and
to
protect
prisoners
from
violence
at
the
hands
of
other
prisoners.
prison
officials
violate
that
constitutional
duty
when
they
act
with
deliberate
indifference
to
a
substantial
risk
of
serious
harm
to
an
inmate.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
a
prison
official
may
be
held
liable
for
acting
with
deliberate
indifference
to
a
substantial
risk
of
serious
harm
only
if
he
is
aware
of
that
risk
and
disregards
it
by
failing
to
take
reasonable
measures
to
abate
it.
that
subjective
definition
of
deliberate
indifference
is
the
equivalent
of
the
recklessness
as
generally
used
in
the
criminal
law
and
it
is
compelled
by
wilson
and
seiter
decided
in
1991
which
interpreted
the
word
"punishment"
in
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
to
mandate
inquiry
into
a
prison
official
state
of
mind
in
which
held
that
inmates
challenging
the
conditions
of
their
confinement
must
satisfy
what
we
called
a
subjective
requirement.
in
object
to
approach
deliberate
indifference
adapted
by
some
courts
of
appeals
and
urged
on
us
by
petitioners
simply
incompatible
with
our
precedent.
the
prisoner
here
is
a
federal
prisoner
who
is
a
transsexual
and
who
respondent,
federal
prison
officials
agree,
projects
feminine
characteristics.
the
petitioner
claimed
to
have
been
beaten
and
raped
by
another
inmate
after
being
transferred
to
a
federal
penitentiary
and
placed
in
its
general
prison
population.
the
district
court
dismissed
petitioner's
lawsuit
which
claimed
the
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
in
respondent's
deliberate
indifference
to
petitioner's
safety
and
the
seventh
circuit
narrowly
affirmed.
because
the
district
court
may
have
applied
a
stricter
test
than
the
one
we
adapt
today,
we
vacate
the
decision
below
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
blackmun
and
justice
stevens
have
filed
concurring
opinions;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
