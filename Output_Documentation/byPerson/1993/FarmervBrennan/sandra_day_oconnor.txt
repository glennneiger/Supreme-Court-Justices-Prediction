justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you...
would
you
preface
your
remarks
by
telling
us
where
the
petitioner
is
now
located
and
under
what
circumstances,
and
also
telling
us
precisely
what
relief
it
is
that
you
are
presently
seeking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
relief
is
it
precisely
that
is
being
sought
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
from
the
individual
respondents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
none
of
whom
were
involved
in
her
placement
at
terre
haute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
an
injunction
to
prevent
her
from
being
moved
to
a
different
facility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
i
come
back
to
this
case?
are
there
any
individual
defendants
here
who
were
officers
or
officials
at
terre
haute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
the
prior
litigation
when
this
prisoner
wanted
to
be
taken
out
of
solitary
and
put
in
the
general
population,
the
bureau
of
prisons
took
the
position
that
the
prisoner
was
too
high
risk
to
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
that
position
and
knowledge,
is
that
attributable
now
to
the
warden
at
terre
haute,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wasn't
it
available?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
see.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
alexander,
if
knowledge
of
the
defendants
is
an
element,
do
you
accept
the
model
penal
code
definition
of
knowledge?
that
is,
knowledge
is
established
if
a
person
is
aware
of
a
high
probability
of
its
existence
unless
he
actually
believes
it
does
not
exist.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
know
that's
your
argument,
but
there
certainly
is
a
risk
here
that
that
isn't
what
the
court's
going
to
adopt,
and
so
i
wanted
to
explore
with
you
whether
you
accept
the
model
penal
code
definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
mr.
bender,
on
that
point
do
you
accept
the
model
penal
code
definition
of
knowledge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
if
i
can
put
my
hands
on
it,
because
i
thought
it
was
of
some
interest.
it
says:
"when
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
a
particular
fact
is
an
element
of
the
offense,
such
knowledge
is
established
if
a
person
is
aware
of
a
high
probability
of
its
existence,
unless
he
actually
believes
it
does
not
exist.
"
