the
more
secure
the
prison,
the
higher
the
incidence
of
rape,
or
in
medium
security
facilities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
terms
of
the
injunctive
relief
that
you're
seeking,
though,
i
don't
comprehend
why
farmer
is
more
at
risk
in
a
maximum
security
facility
than
at
a
medium
security
facility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
she
did...
did
want
to
be
in
the
general
population,
because
when
she
was
at
lewisburg
didn't
she
object
to
being
in
administrative
detention?
justice
ruth
bader

how
about
a
young
man
with
a
slight
build,
youthful
18,
19-year-old,
slender
male.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
at
least
as
far
as
the
transferring
officials
are
concerned,
they
didn't
know,
did
they,
what
the
placement
would
be
inside
terre
haute,
whether
it
was
going
to
be
to
administrative
segregation
or
general
population?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose...
suppose
this...
farmer
had
said
at
terre
haute,
as
farmer
did
at
lewisburg,
i
want
to
be
in
the
general
population,
and
then
this
horrible
event
occurred,
would
she
still
have
a
1983
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
was...
this
was...
it's
a
bivens
case,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
was
about
the
sixth
or
seventh
institution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
one
of
them
was
the
warden
of
terre
haute,
no?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
alleged
horrible
event.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do...
you
do
suggest
twice
in
your
brief
that
a
remand
might
be
appropriate,
remand
might
be
appropriate.
you
say
it
on
page
10
and
again
on
page
29.
but
you're
not
precise
about,
well,
what
should
the
instruction
be
to
the
seventh
circuit.
seventh
circuit,
you
didn't
get
it
right
so
we
have
to
remand.
what
does
the
government
say,
in
a
nutshell,
is
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
second
part
of
your
charge?
the
first
part
is
actual
knowledge
of
the
risk.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
once
you
have
actual
knowledge
of
the
risk,
then
what?
