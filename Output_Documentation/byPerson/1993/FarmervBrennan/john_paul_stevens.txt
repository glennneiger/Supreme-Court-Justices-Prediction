justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
help
me
a
little
bit,
ms.
alexander?
would
you
tell
me
what
you
think
the
precise
legal
issue
is
we
have
to
decide?
i
think
there's
been
perhaps
a
change
in
the
government's
position,
i'm
not
sure.
but
would
you
tell
me
what
you
think
the
issue
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'll
have
to
help
me,
mr....
mr.
bender.
how
does
that
have...
bear
on
the...
on
the
question
of
whether
the
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
that's
what
the
seventh
circuit's
view
of
the
word
"knowledge"
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
rather
clear
it's
not
when
they
say
"actual
knowledge",
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bender,
we've
talked
in...
trying
to
phrase
in
general
terms
without
being
concrete
about
the
particular
allegations.
on
page
7
of
your
adversary's
brief
the
petitioner
points
to
a
bureau
of
prisons
report
in
1986
which,
quote,
stated
that
petitioner
would
be
subject
to
a
great
deal
of
sexual
pressure
because
of
her
youth
and
feminine
appearance.
now,
is
that
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
risk
that's
at
stake
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
take
care
of
the
first...
the
first
half
of
your
two--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
think
that's
a
special
risk
that's
described
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
specifically
identified
as
being
particularly
subject
to
a
great
deal
of
sexual
pressure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
which
way
do
you
construe
those
allegations,
favorable
to
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
isn't
it
fairly
generally
known
that
the
danger
is
not
really
small,
just
throughout
the
prison
system?
don't
you
start
from
a
predicate
of
very
substantial
danger
throughout
the
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me...
that's
a...
that's
really
quite
a
surprising
statistic.
how
do
they
define
assault?
is
it
some...
ones
that
have
been
subject
to
disciplinary
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--presumably
there
are
occasionally
these
incidents
that
don't
surface.
