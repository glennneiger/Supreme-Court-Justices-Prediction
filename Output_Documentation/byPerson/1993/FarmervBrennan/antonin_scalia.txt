justice
antonin
scalia
not
necessarily.
they're
just
grossly
negligent.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
we
do...
we
have
used
the
phrase
"deliberate
indifference"
rather
consistently,
and
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
describing
is
not
deliberate
indifference.
it
is
negligent
indifference,
perhaps,
grossly
negligent
indifference,
but
not
deliberate
indifference.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
a
subjective
element
to
deliberate
indifference?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
alexander,
we
took
the
case
for
this
subjective/objective
issue
and
not
for
whether,
assuming
that
the
subjective
approach
is
correct,
the
granting
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
proper.
but
if
we
were
to
reach
that...
that
latter
issue,
there
really
may
be
a
lot
less
to
this
case
than
meets
the
eye,
don't
you
think?
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
we
were
to
rule
against
you
and
say
that,
in
fact,
there
has
to
be
knowledge
of
the
dangerous
situation
and
that
the
situation
is
dangerous.
if
you
have
a
situation
where
it
is
as
obvious
as
you
say
it
was
here,
i
assume
you
would
not
be
able
to
grant
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
because
the
fact
finder
could
certainly
conclude
from
the
fact
that
it
was
so
obvious
that
this
warden
knew
about
it,
if
it
was
so
obvious,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
i
mean,
we
may
not
be
arguing
about
a
whole
lot
here,
that
it
really
may
not
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
whether
you
say
it's
a
subjective
standard
or
an
objective
standard.
if
it's
as
obvious
as
you
say
it
is,
any
fact
finder
with
a
brain
in
his
head
is
going
to
say
that
the
warden
must
have
known
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
call
it
a
subjective
standard
once
removed,
how
about
that,
all
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bender,
do
you...
do
you
think
that
this...
this
issue
that
we've
been
focusing
on
today,
whether
it's
a
subjective
test
or
a
subjective
test
once
removed,
pertains
only
to
monetary
relief,
and
that...
and
that
as
far
as
injunctive
relief
is
concerned,
the...
as
far
as
that
goes,
the
prison
is
certainly
put
on
notice
when
a
complaint
is
filed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
you...
you
could
say
that
the
complaint
should
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
the
state
of
facts
at
the
time
it
was
filed,
and
you
could
always
come
in
and
say
at
the
time
it
was
filed
we
had
no
knowledge.
justice
antonin
scalia
they'd
file
an
amended
complaint,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
file.
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
are
any
of
the
officials
who
are...
who
are
named
in
the
complaint
and
against
who
injunctive
relief
is
sought,
do
any
of
them
currently
have
the
power
to
provide
the
injunctive
relief?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
in
a
different
institution
now,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
director.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say...
and
your
one
argument
against
injunctive
relief
at
this
point
is
that
there's
no
threat
of
what...
what
is
sought
to
be
enjoined?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what's
the
other
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
really
don't
agree
with
the...
with
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
that's
not
a
probability.
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
agree
with
that.
if
there's
a
high
probability
that
he's
in
the
general
population,
that's...
that
seems
to
me
enough
to
create
deliberate
indifference.
he
really
doesn't,
you
know.
yeah,
he
may
well
be
there,
he
probably
is
there,
but
i
don't
care.
i
consider
that,
you
know--
[laughter]
i
consider
that
deliberate
indifference.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
aware
of
the
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there
is
a
probability
that
he's
in
that
population,
he's
aware
of
the
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
1
percent?
1
percent
of
all
of
the
prisoners
were
involved
in
an
assault?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
assaulted.
justice
antonin
scalia
1
percent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
that
year.
