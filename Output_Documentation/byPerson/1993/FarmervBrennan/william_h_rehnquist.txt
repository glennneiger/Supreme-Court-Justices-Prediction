we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-7247.
the
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk
until
you
get
outside
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
we're
going
to
hear
argument
next
in
92-7247,
dee
farmer
v.
edward
brennan.
ms.
alexander.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where...
where
would
the
government
be
free
to
move
her
if
she
gets
her
injunction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
she
was
sentenced
to
a
term
that
would
ordinarily
end
her
up
in
a
penitentiary,
was
she
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
her...
would...
her
injunction
would
request
that
she
be
confined
only
in
an
fci
and
not
in
a
penitentiary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
between
those
two?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
didn't...
we
didn't
take
the
case,
though,
on
that
point.
we
took
on
the
subjective
standard
involved
for
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
we
didn't
take
the
case
to
decide
whether
there
was
time
enough
allowed
for
discovery
in
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
you...
that
you
have
to
show
that
the
prison
officials
were
deliberately
indifferent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
your
standard
come
pretty
close
to
being
just
negligence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
really
water
it
down,
it
seems
to
me,
in
your
application.
you
say
that
simply
awareness
of
an
obvious
risk
is
enough,
that
one...
the
fact
finder
need
not
further
infer
that
their...
that
the
person
was
deliberately
indifferent
to
the
risk.
well,
why
is
that
any
different
from
negligence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we're...
we're
talking
about
a
very
narrow
aspect
of
liability,
or
state
of
mind
basically.
and
the
government
says
you
may
infer
deliberate
indifference
from
the
obviousness
of
a
risk.
you
say
you
don't
even
have
to
do
that;
simply
knowledge
of
the
obviousness
of
risk,
without
any
inference
by
the
fact
finder,
is
enough.
and
i
honestly
don't
see
why
that's
much
different
than
negligent...
than
the
state
of
mind
required
for
negligent
injury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
canton
was
not
an
eighth
amendment
case,
though,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
alexander.
mr.
bender,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
i'm
not
sure
you
do
then
agree
with
the...
with
the
model
penal
code.
it
seems
to
me
the
model
penal...
it's
one
thing
to
say
you
can
infer
from
knowledge
of
the
risk
that
you
knew
about
it,
or
that
you
had
the
necessary
subjective
standard.
but
to
say
there's
simply
a
high
prob...
that
you
knew
there
was
a
high
probability,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
fall
a
good
deal
short
of
ultimately
inferring
actual
intent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
actual--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
is
it
your
position
that
the
finder
of
fact
must
infer
that
they
actually
knew
of
the
risk?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
you
could
infer
it
from
knowledge
of
other...
other
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
i
suggest
you
don't
really
agree
with
the
model
penal
code.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
analyze,
i
think,
the
thing
best
in
terms
of
what
instruction
do
you
give
the
jury.
and
it
seems
to
me,
your...
under
your
view
you
would
give
the
jury
that
you...
you
must
have
known
and
then
go
on
to
say
you
can
infer
knowledge
from
a
number
of
things.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
just
sexual
assaults.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
kind
of
assault.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
ms.
alexander,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
alexander.
the
case
is
submitted.
