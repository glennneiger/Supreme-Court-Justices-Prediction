mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
by
clarifying
a
couple
of
factual
matters
that
the
court
expressed
interest
in
in
ms.
alexander's
argument.
first
of
all,
although
it
was
true
until
7
days
ago
that
the
petitioner
was
in
the
general
population
at
florence,
7
days
ago
he
went
into
administrative
detention
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
and
so
he
is
presently
in
administrative
detention
at
florence.
but
prior
to
that
time
he
had
been
in
the
general
population
for
5...
for
5
months.
a
related
clarification
that
i
would
like
to
make--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
don't
think
that
does
at
all,
but
the
court
had
asked
that
and
there's
no
way
that
ms.
alexander
would
know
that.
i
just
found
that
out
yesterday,
and
i
didn't
want
to
leave
the
court
with
a
misunderstanding.
i
don't
think
that's
relevant
at
all.
something
that
is
possibly
relevant
to
relief
that
i
also
need
to
clarify
is
something
that
i
think
reflects
a
misunderstanding
on
our
part
in
our
brief.
at
the
end
of
our
brief
in
talking
about
the
possibility
of
injunctive
relief,
we
said
that
we
thought
that
injunctive
relief
was
no
longer...
would
no
longer
be
appropriate
in
this
case
because
the
petitioner
was
in
administrative
detention
status
because
of
his
hiv-positive
status
and
the
fact
that
he
had
been
involved
in
consensual
sexual
activity
at
oxford.
bureau
of
prisons
has
a
policy
with
regard
to
hiv-positive
inmates
that
if
they
are
either
predators
or
if
they
are
sexually
promiscuous,
it
will
very
often
put
them
in
administrative
detention
status.
and
it
was
our
understanding
at
the
time
we
wrote
the
brief
that
the
petitioner
would
remain
in
that
kind
of...
either
in
that
kind
of
segregated
or
status
or
at
a
place
like
springfield,
which
is
where
he
went
after
terre
haute,
which
is
a
medical
facility.
and
although
petitioner
did
remain
in
those
two
statuses
for
a
long
time...
he
was
at
springfield
for
2-1/2
years
after
terre
haute,
after
he
was
put
in
administrative
detention
at
terre
haute...
he
was
then
put
in
general
population
at
florence,
where
he
has
existed
for
5
months
without
any
problem.
what's
going
on
there
is
that
putting
hiv-positive
people
into
a
segregated
status
is
something
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
does
but
they
don't
do
that
permanently.
they
continue
to
reevaluate
whether
that's
the
appropriate
thing
to
do,
because
the
general
presumption
is
that
they
would
like
to
put
everybody
in
general
population.
and
therefore
the
time
came...
after
he
had
been
without
serious
problems
for
a
long
time,
the
time
came
when
they
thought
that
they
should
put
him
in
a
general
population.
we
still
think
that
injunctive
relief
is
not
appropriate
here
because
the
injunction
here
that's
requested
has
to
do
with
placing
him
in
a
penitentiary
status.
penitentiaries
are
those
next-to-the-highest-level
institutions,
like
lewisburg,
of
which
there
are
four
or
five,
i
think.
since
there
is
no
present
threat
of
his
being
placed
in
a
penitentiary
status,
injunctive
relief
we
think
is
inappropriate
in
this
case,
because
there
isn't
the
kind
of
threat
of
that
kind
of
action
which
would
justify
injunctive
relief.
so
the
conclusion
is
the
same.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
that's
what
i
was
going
to
say.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
clarified
whether
it's
exactly
the
same
test
in
injunctive
relief
cases.
mr.
paul
bender
but
it
doesn't
really
come
up,
because
if
you're
suing
for
injunctive
relief
you
will
put
the...
you
will
put
the
prison
officials
on
notice
by
the
allegations
in
your
complaint.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
even
if
you
said
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--you
could...
you
can
put
them
on
notice
by
sending
them
a
letter
saying
that
the
following--
mr.
paul
bender
--before
you
file.
so
i
don't
think
that
will...
i
don't
think
knowledge
of
facts
will
ordinarily
be
a
problem
in
injunctive
actions.
i
think
it
will...
the
issue
will
be
much
more
important
in
damage
actions,
which
is
the...
the
only...
the
action
brought
against
four
of
the
people
here.
it's
important
in
that
regard
to
realize...
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
those
four
people
against
whom
damages
are
sought
here,
their
only
connection
with
this
case
was
that
they
were
the
officials
who
transferred
the
petitioner
to
terre
haute.
none
of
those
people
were
the
officials
at
terre
haute
who
decided
to
put
him
in
the
general
population.
mr.
paul
bender
one
of
them
was
the
warden
of
terre
haute
at
one
time,
but
at
the
time
the
action
was
brought
he
was
not...
he
was
no
longer
the
warden
at
terre
haute.
but
he
is
not
sued
for
money
damages,
interestingly
enough.
he
was
the
warden
at
terre
haute
at
the
time
of
the
incident,
but
he's
not
being
sued
for
monetary
damages,
he's
only
being
sued
in
his
official
capacity,
which
is
only
a
suit
for
injunctive
relief.
that's
an
interesting
facet
of
this
case.
the
only
people
who
are
being
sued
for
money
damages
are
the
officials
at
oxford
and
the
officials
at
the
north
central
office
who
authorized
the
transfer
to
terre
haute.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
the
director--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
does.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that
would
be
the
only
person
among
those
people
who
would
currently
have
the
power--
mr.
paul
bender
--that's
the
main
argument,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
there
is
another
argument.
mr.
paul
bender
which
is
that
there
is
not...
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record
that
there...
even
in
a
penitentiary,
that
there
would
be
the
very
serious
threat
of
injury
which
would
justify
an
injunction
against
the
transfer
to
any
penitentiary,
but
i
don't
think
the
court,
or
the
lower
court
if
you
remand
the
case
on
that,
would
have
to
reach
that
issue,
because
there
is
no
plan
whatever
and
no
consideration
of
putting
him
in
one
of
the
very
few
penitentiary
institutions.
the
one
he
was
in
in
general
population,
which
is
lewisburg...
terre
haute
is
no
longer
what
you
would
call
a
penitentiary
institution.
it
is
a
lower
level.
the
one
penitentiary
institution
that
he
was
in,
the
warden
there
made
the
judgment,
as
is
apparent
in
his
district
court
litigation
with...
with
carlson,
wouldn't
made
the
judgment
that
it
wasn't
safe
to
put
him
in
a...
in
the
general
population,
and
we
know
no
reason
to
think
that
that
judgment
would
be
any
different
today.
the
court...
one
other
factual
matter.
justice
ginsburg,
you
talked
about
the
horrible
event
that
occurred
here.
the
court
should
be
clear
that
that
is
an
allegation
only.
there
is--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
alleged
horrible
event.
i
think
that
important
to
bear
in
mind.
the
court
said
that
it
took
the
case
to
deal
with
this
subjective/objective
issue,
and
that's
what
i
would
like
to
address...
to
address
myself
to.
i
assume
the
court
noticed
an
apparent
conflict
between
the
seventh
circuit
on
that,
which
seemed
to...
to
say
that
there
was
a
subjective
test,
which
did
say
there
was
a
subjective
test
of
actual
knowledge,
and
the
third
circuit.
one
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
indicates
that
"should
have
known"
is
enough.
there
doesn't
have
to
be
actual
knowledge.
i
think
it's
important
in
thinking
about
this,
to
think
first
about
what
deliberate
indifference
means.
everybody
agrees
that
that's
the
standard,
deliberate
indifference.
i
think
there
are
at
least
two
factors
in
deliberate
indifference,
and
it's
important
not
to
get
them
confused
with
each
other.
in
a
situation
like
this
where
you're
talking
about
protecting
an
inmate
from
attacks
by
other
inmates,
deliberate
indifference
has
one
element
of
the
prison
official's
knowledge
of
the
risk.
there's
did
the
prison
official
know,
or
if
you
take
the
objective
approach,
should
the
prison
official
have
known
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
risk?
that's
the
first
element.
then
there's
a
second
element;
knowing
about
a
certain
risk...
and
there
are
lots
of
risks
in
prison...
was
the
prison
official
deliberately
indifferent
to
that
risk.
we
take
the
position,
as
did
the
seventh
circuit,
that
on
the
first
of
those
elements
the
court
has
already
decided...
and
if
it
hadn't
it
should
decide
now...
that
it
is
a
subjective
standard.
you
cannot
be
deliberately
indifferent
to
a
risk
unless
you
know
about
the
risk.
and
that
is
the
position
that
we
urge
you
to
adopt.
mr.
paul
bender
the
one
you
had
mentioned
to
ms.
alexander?
mr.
paul
bender
would
you
read
it
again?
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
we
accept
that.
in
fact,
our
brief...
our
brief
makes
reference
to
that.
mr.
paul
bender
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think
what
the
model
penal
code
definition
is
referring
to
is
what's
often
called
the
ostrich
situation,
the
head-in-the-sand
situation,
that
if
there's
a...
if
there
is
a
high
probability
and
you
stop
yourself
from
making
a
conclusion,
you
turn
away
from
it,
that
that
can
also
be
dealt
with
as
actual
knowledge.
but
otherwise,
i
think
you
need
to
have
actual
knowledge.
just
the
fact--
mr.
paul
bender
--well--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
that's
what...
that's
where
i
think
we
can
get
confused
between
the
first
issue
and
the
second.
if
you're
aware
of
a
high
probability
of
risk,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
aware
of
a
risk.
and
then
the
question
is
were
you
deliberately
indifferent
to
the
risk
that
you
were
aware
of,
and
those
are
two
different
questions.
it's
not
enough
to
show,
in
a
deliberate
indifference
case,
that
the
prison
officials
were
aware
that
there
was
a
dangerous
situation.
you've
also
got
to
show
that
they
were
deliberately
indifferent
to
that
dangerous
situation.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
that
they
knew
of
the
danger,
right.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
we
believe
that
you
can
make
such
a
finding
based
on
circumstantial
evidence,
but
the
finding
must
be...
if
you
have
a
jury,
you
should
tell
the
jury
that
they...
in
order
to
find
there's
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment,
you
have
to
find
that
the
defendant
knew
of
the
risk--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
was
reading
that...
that
part
of
the
high
probability
to
refer
to
a
situation
where
if
you
know
of
a
high...
if
you
know...
i
think
the
problem
is
that
risks
are
probabilities
and
we're
talking
here
about
risks,
and
therefore
if
you
know
of
the
high
probability
of
a
risk,
you
know
enough
about
the
risk.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
i
agree
completely,
yes--
mr.
paul
bender
--they
don't
know
he
is
in
terre
haute?
mr.
paul
bender
they
just
know
there's
a
probability
that
he
is
in
terre
haute.
that
would
be
different.
there
i
think
they
would
have
to
know
that
he
is
in
terre
haute.
mr.
paul
bender
if...
if
liability
would
turn
on
their
knowledge
that
he's
in
terre
haute,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
on
that
part
of
it,
i--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
if...
it's
sort
of
a
risk
on
a
risk.
if
you
are
aware
that
there's
a
high
probability
he's
in
the
general
population
and
the
general
population
is
a
very
dangerous
place,
then
i
think
the
prison
official
should
try
to
find
out
whether
or
not
he
is
in
the
general
population,
and
not
to
do
so
would
be
deliberate
indifference.
mr.
paul
bender
he's
aware
of
the
risk.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
the
confusing
thing
is
we're
dealing
here
with
risks
to
begin
with,
and
so
we're
dealing
with
probabilities,
and
you've
got
to
be
aware
of
the
probability.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
i
think
so.
otherwise
it's
hard
to
say
that
you're
deliberate
indifferent
to
it,
if
you
don't
know
about
it.
i
think
that
flows
from
the
court's
decision
in--
mr.
paul
bender
--you
may
have
a
defense
to
a...
to
an
eighth
amendment
claim.
you
may
not
have
a
defense
to
a
negligence
claim.
and
it's
really
important
to
understand
here
that
there's
also
a
possibility
of
bringing
a
tort
claims
act
suit
for
negligence.
on
the
other
hand,
i
do
want
to
say
that
we
don't
take
the
position
that
this
ought
to
be
approached
as
if
it
were
a
criminal
case.
there
are
some
things
in
the
seventh
circuit
opinions
which
say
use
a
criminal
approach
to
what
recklessness
is.
i
don't
think
that
helps.
these
are
not
criminal
cases.
if
a
warden
of
a
prison--
mr.
paul
bender
--first
of
all,
one
problem
is
the
seventh
circuit
never
wrote
an
opinion
in
this
case,
so
we're
talking
about
other
seventh
circuit
opinions.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
you
should
tell
the
seventh
circuit
that
they
got
it
right,
that
there
has...
it's
actual
knowledge
of
the
risk
rather
than
somebody...
a
reasonable
person
should
have
known
of
the
risk,
that
they
got
right.
i
think
you
should
tell
them
that
it
doesn't
help
to
look
at
this
as
if
it
were
a
criminal
case,
and
it
doesn't
help
to
tell
a
jury
that
they
should
look
at
it
as
if
it
were
a
criminal
case.
i
don't
think
we
will...
we
take
the
position
that
we
don't
take
the
position
that
a
warden
who
was
found
to
be
liable
because
of
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment,
if
that
should
occur,
is
equivalent
to
a
criminal.
it's
not
a
criminal
case,
it's
a
civil
case,
and
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
thought
about
in
those...
in
those
terms.
mr.
paul
bender
it's...
i
think
it's
fine
to
do
that
and
i
think
you
should
do
that,
but
it's
the
aura
of
criminality
that
i
don't...
that
i
don't
think
is
acceptable.
mr.
paul
bender
and
i
think
you
should
make
clear
what
the
state
of
mind
is
that
you're
talking
about.
but
i
don't
think
it--
mr.
paul
bender
--it's
civil.
it's...
to
be,
to
make
sure
that
juries
are
not
told
that
they
should
only
find
an
eighth
amendment
violation
if
they
find
that
the
defendants
were
criminals,
were
the
kind
of
people
who
should
be...
who
should
be
treated
as
criminals
or
go
to
jail
or
have
criminal
sanctions
invoked
against
them.
i
think
that
puts
an
aura
on
the
case
which
is
not...
which
is
not
entirely
appropriate.
mr.
paul
bender
i
should
say,
in
that
connection,
that
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
a
position
that
is...
is
forged
from
a
variety
of
interests
that
we
have.
the
government
interests
are
certainly
in
defending
officials
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
against
unjustifiable
and
incorrect
suits
of
violations
of
the
eighth
amendment.
but
the
government
also
plays
a
role
in
suing
prisons
for
unconstitutional
prison
conditions,
and
i
think
it's
important
that
we
bear
both
of
those
things
in
mind.
and,
for
example,
in
trying
to
remedy
unconstitutional
prison
conditions,
i
don't
think
that
we
should
be
required
to
show
that
the
people
who
are
running
those
institutions
should
be
treated
as
criminals.
that's
not...
that
just
may...
it
seems
to
me
is
too
heavy
a
burden.
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--of
the
risk.
mr.
paul
bender
then
you
have
to
be
deliberately
indifferent
to
the
risk,
which
means
that
there
has
to
be
something
that
you
could
do
readily
to
avoid
the
risk,
and
you
have
to
have
made
a
decision
not
to
do
that
even
though
it
was
something
that
could
easily
have
been
done.
that's
the
indifferent
part
of
it,
and
the...
and
the
deliberate
indifferent
part
of
it
is
that
you
are
aware
that
there's
something
you
could
do
and
that
you
don't
do
anything
to
deal
with
it.
now
that's
very
hard
to
quantify,
and
i
think
that's
where
the
obviousness
comes
into
it,
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
confusions.
there
if
you...
there
you
could
say
if
it
is
obvious
that
something
should
be
done
and
this
person
didn't
do
it,
that
might
amount
to
deliberate
indifference.
obvious
in
the
sense
that
there's
something
that
can
be
done
to
alleviate
the
risk
and
that
action
isn't
taken.
mr.
paul
bender
that
is
a
knowledge
of
a
risk,
but
another--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
because
the
risk
has
to
be
a
very
serious
risk,
a
very
severe
risk
of
very
serious
harm.
otherwise
every
prison
official
in
the
country
would
be
violating
the
eighth
amendment
at
every
moment.
there's
always
a
risk
in
every
prison
of
something
happening.
mr.
paul
bender
just
the
fact
that
somebody
is
effeminate
or
young.
mr.
paul
bender
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
a
great
deal
of
sexual
pressure.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
very
great
likelihood
that
the
person
is
in
danger.
sexual
pressure
seems
to
me
an
awfully
vague
term
to
refer
to
that.
it
would
be
better...
it
would
be
an
allegation
that's
closer
to
liability
in
this
case
if
it
was
subject
to
a
considerable
risk
of
being
attacked.
and
it
has
to
be
a
considerable
risk
of
being
attacked,
not
just
a
small
risk.
and
that
is,
again,
a
very
hard
part
of
the
standard
to
quantify,
but
it's
important
to
realize
that
it's
got
to
be
more
than
the
normal
risks
in
prison.
and,
also,
people
who
are
young
and
effeminate
have
to
be
housed
somewhere
in
an
institution.
you...
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
them
to
say
that
they
always
have
to
be
kept
in
a
solitary
confinement
situation.
the
bureau
of
prisons
likes
to
have
people
in
the
general
population,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
a
small
danger
that
a
person
will
be
attacked
in
the
general
population
does
not
seem
to
me
to--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
i
don't
think
that's...
i
don't
think
that's
true,
at
least
with
the
federal
prison
system.
the...
the
statistics
that
i've
seen,
which
are
published
statistics
from
1989,
indicates
that
the
number
of
assaults
of
any
kind,
including
sexual
assaults
but
other
assaults
as
well,
in
the
federal
prison
system
in
1989
in
general
was
about
1
percent
of
the
population,
a
little
bit
less
than
1
percent
of
the
population.
that
does
not
suggest
to
me
that
throughout
the
system
there
is
a
considerable
risk.
interestingly
enough
as
well,
the
statistics
for
the
institution
to
which
the
petitioner
was
transferred,
terre
haute,
the
statistics
of
assault...
assaultive
occasions
there
during
that
year
are
exactly
the
same,
almost
exactly
the
same
percentage,
slightly
less
1...
less
than
1
percent.
there
may
be
some
institutions
at
some
times
where
there
is
a
much
greater
risk,
and
i
don't
mean
to
denigrate
a
1
percent
risk.
mr.
paul
bender
were
assaulted.
mr.
paul
bender
yeah.
mr.
paul
bender
any
kind.
mr.
paul
bender
an
assault
of
any
kind
within
the
federal
system
during--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
paul
bender
assaults
of
any
kind.
we
don't
have...
i
did
not
see
figures
about
sexual...
a
breakdown
with
regard
to
sexual
assaults.
so
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
the
ones
that
have
been
reported.
mr.
paul
bender
and
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
and
we
don't
know
how...
we
don't
know
how
great
they
are.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
indicates
that
either
there
was
a
great
risk
of
that
kind
of
assault
at
terre
haute
generally,
in
the
general
population,
and
there's
certainly
nothing
that
indicates
there
was
any
such
risk
in
segregation
at
terre
haute.
and
the
position
of
the
respondents
here
is
that
the
four
respondents
who
were
responsible
for
sending
the
petitioner
to
terre
haute
only
sent
the
petitioner
to
terre
haute
as
a...
as
an
institution.
they
knew
that
when
he
got
to
terre
haute
he
would
be
put
in
a
segregated
situation,
administrative
detention,
for
purposes
of
evaluation,
and
that
the
officials
there
would
know
what
the
situation
was
in
terre
haute
at
the
time,
and
would
know
about
his
transsexualism
and
his
history
in
prison
previously,
and
that
they
would
then
make
a
decision,
based
on
their...
their
based
judgment,
about
whether
it
was
safe
to
put
him
in
the
general
population.
and
it's
not
at
all
certain
that
they
would
make
a
judgment
to
put
him
in
the
general
population.
when
he
was
at
lewisburg,
which
was
the
first
institution
he
landed
at,
he
was
never
put
in
the
general
population.
and
therefore
you
cannot
say
on
this
record
that
there
could
be
enough
evidence
to
survive
a
summary
judgment
motion
that
these...
that
these
defendants
had
the
knowledge
of
the
risk.
because
even
if
you
were
to
assume
that
there
was
a
substantial
risk
in
the
general
population
at
terre
haute...
and
there's
not
any
basis
for
that
either
given
the
statistics
i've
just
mentioned.
even
if
you
were
to
assume
that,
there's
no
inevitability
that
the
petitioner
is
going
to
go
into
the
general
population
at
terre
haute.
he
could
stay
in
segregation
for
a
substantial
time
and
then
be
moved
to
another
institution.
transfers
from
one
institution
to
another
are
often
does
as
a
disciplinary
matter.
if
somebody,
as
this
petitioner
has,
manipulates
the
institution,
has
access
to
telephones,
commits
credit-card
fraud
while
in
the
institution,
it's
often
thought
that
it's
useful
to
move
him
to
another
institution
where
he
won't
have
that...
that
same
ability
to
manipulate.
that
could
involve
moving
him
to
another
institution
where
he
would
stay
in
a
segregation
status
for
6
months
and
then
be
moved
to
yet
a
different
institution
if
the
thought
was
he
should
then
come
out
of
administrative
segregation.
and
so
it's
for
those
reasons
that
we
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
basis
for...
for
remand
on
that
issue,
that
the
court
can
affirm
the
summary
judgment
on
that
issue.
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
