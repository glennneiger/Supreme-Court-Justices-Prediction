does
the
government--
--the
petitioner
is
in
the
general
population
at
the
current
facility?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
it
a
part
of
your
case,
just
to
follow
this
line
of
questioning,
that
the
maximum
security
prisons
are
the
most
dangerous
because
they
have
the
most
dangerous
people,
or
is
that
not
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
the
government
doesn't
make
an
error
if
it
selects
a...
a
maximum
security
prison,
necessarily.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
doesn't
make
an
error
if
it
puts
the
person
in
the
general
population,
necessarily.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
there
is
a
risk
that's
known,
that
inmates
of
a
certain
kind
are
assaulted
at
terre
haute,
and
the
prison
official
knows
there's
a
high
probability
that
this
person
is
in
terre
haute,
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
liability,
in
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
bender,
can--
--but
the
reason
that
that
is
helpful,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
it
does
invoke
such
constructions
as
the
model
penal
code
where
we're
talking
about
an
actual
state
of
mind.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
that
the
state
of
mind
i
have
described
is
not
usually
a
test
in
the
civil
law
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
not
civil,
but
it's
not
criminal
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
anyone
has
suggested
that.
