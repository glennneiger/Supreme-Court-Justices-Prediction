ms.
amy
l.
wax
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
broad
remedial
provision
of
this
statute,
a
judge
is
allowed
to
award
any
remedy
that
he
deems
appropriate,
and
as
this
court
said
in
the
burlington
case,
appropriate
means
appropriate
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
we
think
that
the
answer
to
this
case
and
the
answer
to
many
of
the
questions
that
the
justices
have
posed
today
comes
in
asking
the
right
question,
and
that
question
is,
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
statute?
what
is
its
aim?
why
did
congress
enact
the
idea?
congress
enacted
idea
to
provide
a
basic
floor
of
educational
opportunity
for
disabled
children,
to
ensure
that
those
children
received
an
education
that
was
calculated
to
enable
them
to
receive
benefit,
and
in
deciding
what
remedies
are
appropriate,
we
believe
that
basic
equitable
principles
dictate
that
the
legal
standard
should
be
no
more
onerous
and
no
more
complicated
than
are
absolutely
necessary
to
effectuate
the
statutory
purpose.
now,
with
respect
to
the
questions
that
justice
ginsburg
have
raised
about
whether
parents
have
to
make
reasonable
inquiries
or
reasonable
efforts
to
comply
with
the
particulars
of
section
1401,
or
whether
they
have
to
choose
a
school
from
a
list,
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
no
such
per
se
requirements
should
be
imposed
as
a
rigid
matter.
there
should
be
no
requirement
as
such
that
parents
make
inquiries,
and
the
reason
for
this,
first
of
all,
is
that
the
statute
contains
no
such
requirement.
there
is
no
explicit
mandate
that
parents
make
inquiries,
seek
information,
confer
and
consult
endlessly
before
they
may
challenge
the
iep
proposed
and
received
a
remedy.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
it
certainly
increases
your
chances
of
getting
reimbursement,
justice
scalia,
but
part
of
our
point
is
that
just
because
you
choose
a
school
from
a
list
doesn't
mean
you
satisfy
the
substantive
showing
that
it's
appropriate
for
your
child.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
i
think
they
very
well
could
contest
it,
because
they
don't
want
to
provide
reimbursement,
and
just
because
it's
on
the
list,
although
it
satisfies
the
particulars
of
the
definition
of
a
fape,
it
might
not
meet
the
substantive
standard
under
rowley
for--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--exactly.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
they
couldn't
come
forward
and
say,
it
doesn't
come
forward
and
comply
with
the
procedural
and
formal
requirements,
but
under
rowley
they
could
certainly
try
and
come
forward
and
say,
this
school
is
inappropriate
in
that
it
doesn't
provide
the
sort
of
education
that
your
child
needs.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
correct,
and
they
could
contest
that,
too,
and
those
are
the
two
elements
of
the
inquiry.
now,
it's
important
to
realize
that
every
time
you
set
up
a
requirement
like,
the
parent
has
to
make
inquiries,
the
parent
has
to
look
at
a
list,
that
requirement
comes
at
a
cost.
it
comes
at
a
cost
to
the
parents
and
the
children
seeking
a
remedy,
and
that's
because
although
it
may
seem
simple
to
ask
parents
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
call
the
school
district,
as
this
court
recognized
in
burlington,
the
reply
that
they're
likely
to
get
is,
we'll
get
back
to
you,
we'll
look
into
it,
call
back
next
week,
when
the
right
person
is
here,
and
that
produces
delay.
and
when
there's
delay,
the
parents
are
in
a
quandary,
because
each
day
that
the
child
is
in
an
inappropriate
and
unsatisfactory
setting,
is
a
day
that's
lost
to
the
education
of
that
child,
and
it
also
produces
uncertainty,
because
the
parents
ask
themselves,
how
much
of
an
effort
is
enough,
how
much
of
an
official
response
is
sufficient,
when
can
we
cut
our
losses
and
move
our
child,
and
all
of
those
uncertainties
get
played
out
at
the
remedial
phase
of
the
statute,
when
the
judge
is
asked
to
consider
how
much
effort
is
enough,
whether
what
the
school
district
did
is
equitably
sufficient.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
that
overstates
the
statutory
interest
in
having
parents
and
school
districts
consult
and
confer.
that
interest
in
mutual
cooperation
is
fully
exhausted
by
coming
together
to
try
and
formulate
an
iep
in
the
first
instance.
once
that
proposal
is
signed
and
sealed
and
proposed,
then
under
the
statute
parents
have
no
openended
obligation
to
consult
and
confer
without
end,
and
in
fact
as
this
court
recognized
in
burlington,
to
incorporate
such
a
requirement
would
be
very
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
parents,
because
the
school
district
always
has
the
upper
hand
in
this
situation.
on
the
contrary,
under
section
1415
of
the
act,
the
parents
have
an
immediate
right
to
challenge
the
adequacy
of
the
iep,
to
challenge
any
aspect
of
the
school
district's
proposal
at
the
administrative
level,
first
by
directing
the
challenge
to
the
school
district
itself,
then
with
appeal
to
the
state,
and
finally,
judicial
review.
so
i
think
petitioners
vastly
overstate
the
statutory
interest
in
consultation
and
cooperation,
and
if
their
proposal
was
adopted,
it
would
work
to
the
detriment
of
the
parents
and
the
children.
so
the
point
is
that
the
requirement
that
parents
choose
from
a
list,
which
vastly
reduces
their
options
for
providing
their
child's
education,
and
that
they
inquire
of
the
school
district,
creates
tremendous
obstacles
and
complications
to
their
receiving
relief,
and
the
question
is,
the
equitable
question
is,
do
those
added
complications
come
at
some
benefit
to
the
effectuation
of
the
statutory
purpose,
and
the
answer
has
to
be
no.
the
statutory
purpose
is
fully
effectuated
when
a
judge
determines
whether
in
a
particular
case
the
education
that
the
child
received
in
the
parent's
chosen
institution
was
an
appropriate
education
within
the
meaning
of
rowley.
that
is,
it
accomplished
the
purpose
of
the
act,
which
was
to
provide
a
basic
floor
of
educational
opportunity.
and
if
the
education
lives
up
to
that
standard,
then
consideration
of
whether
the
school's
on
a
list,
or
whether
inquiries
were
made,
or
whether
certain
formalities
were
complied
with,
really
becomes
superfluous.
they
become
beside
the
point,
and
in
that
case
it
would
effectuate
the
statutory
purpose
to
allow
reimbursement,
and
it
certainly
would
defeat
the
statutory
purpose
to
deny
reimbursement.

ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
we
are,
your
honor.
we
think
that
as
a
hard
and
fast,
rigid
requirement,
it
doesn't
hold
water.
it
may
come
in
at
the
very
end
of
the
inquiry
of
whether
the
education
is
appropriate.
it
could
be
a
factor
in
a
case
where
the
child
didn't
clearly
benefit
from
the
education,
where
the
child
didn't
make
educational
progress,
and
then
the
judge
is
thrown
back
on
certain
indicators
of
educational
quality
with
respect
to
the
private
school
that
was
chosen,
and
then
the
judge
might
look
at
things
such
as
how
well-trained
were
the
teachers,
how
does
this
school
compare
to
other
schools,
did
the
parents
have
ready
at
hand
an
alternative
which
looks
like
it
might
have
been
better
than
the
alternative
which
was
chosen?
none
of
those
considerations
would
come
in
in
this
case,
because
here
there
was
clear
benefit
to
the
child,
and
we
think
that
when
the
child
clearly
benefits,
that's
really
essentially
all
the
judge
needs
to
know,
because--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we
don't
agree--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--no.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
would
distinguish
between
the
availability
of
some
reimbursement,
okay,
which
we
think
should
not
be
affected
by
the
alternatives
that
might
be
available
but
should
only
be
determined
by
whether
this
school
that
the
parents
chose
meets
the
appropriate
standard.
the
amount--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--no,
we
do
not.
we
think
the
court
could
limit
the
amount
of
reimbursement.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
on
equitable
grounds
because,
it
considering
that
the
substantive
standard
of
appropriateness
is
really
a
standard
that
sets
a
floor,
and
that
therefore
the
court
could
say,
well,
since
that
floor
is
abided
by,
we
can
limit
the
amount
to
what
the
floor
would
cost.
