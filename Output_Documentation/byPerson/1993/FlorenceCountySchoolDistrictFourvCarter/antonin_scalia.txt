--than
that.
if
you
insist
upon
free,
appropriate
public
education,
there's
no
private
placement.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
to
send
the
person
to
a
public
school.
wouldn't
that
have
to
be
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
willing
to
acknowledge
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
under
public
supervision,
that
that's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
free
appropriate...
what
an
appropriate
public
education
means,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
exactly,
or
to
put
it
differently,
whether
the
iep
and
the
fape
requirements
were
put
there
out
of
mistrust
of
the
parents,
or
out
of
mistrust
of
school
authorities.
it
seems
to
me
they
were
put
there
to
make
sure
that
the
school
authorities
did
not
give
the
disabled
child
second-rate
treatment.
you
really
think
congress
was
worried
about
the
parents
giving
their
disabled
child
second-rate
treatment,
putting
him
in
a
private
placement
that
would
be
no
good
for
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ayer,
what
does
a
parent...
what
is
a
parent
supposed
to
do
when
a
school
district
such
as
your
client
has
failed
to
provide
the
iep,
the
fape,
and
what
the
statute
requires,
but
there
happens
to
be
no
alternative
school
around
that
works
via
an
iep,
and
the
parent
finds
the
best
school
available,
saying,
you
know,
the
school
district
has
failed
me,
has
violated
the
statute,
i'm
going
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
my
kid--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
there
happens
to
be
no
private
school
who
is
willing
to
go
through
all
of
the
folderol
of
an
iep,
or
they
think
an
iep
is
really
not
the
best
way
to
do
it?
that
parent
has
no
remedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
forgot
the
first
two
already.
what
were
the
first
two?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you're...
go
on.
i'm
sorry.
go...
go,
go.
i
took
the
last
one.
you're
arguing...
if
burlington
hadn't
been
decided,
you'd
be
making
essentially
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
the
stay-put
provision,
wouldn't
you?
wouldn't
that
be
essential
to,
for
example,
the
maintenance
of
control
over
public
education
and
assuring
that
the
public
educational
authorities
would
see
that
the
kid
did
not
get
sidetracked
into
a
second-rate
classroom
while
they
were
fighting
over
what
to
do?
i
mean,
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
took
a
big
risk
in
doing
that.
i
mean,
it
may
well
be
that
when
they
came
to
apply
for
reimbursement
and
the
school
district
resisted
it,
a
court
would
have
found,
well,
the
trident
school
is
really
not
a
very
good
school,
and
since
you
didn't
provide
substantially
what
the
act
wanted,
we're
not
going
to
allow...
that's
a
big
risk
for
the
parents.
why
isn't
that
risk
enough?
once
the
school
district
has
failed
to
meet
its
obligation,
the
parent
has
the
right,
if
the
parent
wants
to
take
the
chance,
to
send
the
kid
to
any
school
at
all.
if
the
school
doesn't
meet
up
to
fulfill
the
obligation
substantially
of
the
act,
the
parent
gets
no
reimbursement.
that's
a
substantial
sanction,
but
i
don't
know
why
the
parent
has
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
the
school
board
had
its
chance,
decided
not
to
provide
these
services,
and
it
seems
to
me
it
falls
back
into
the
lap
of
the
parent.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say,
would
have.
that
was
what
they
projected
the
results
of
this
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
the
school
board
projected?
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
record
part
of
our
record?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
fairness,
mr.
wright,
at
that
hearing
the
issue
between
the
school
board
and
these
parents
was
still
whether
3
hours
a
week
is
enough
or
not,
whether
you
need
a
self-contained
program,
or
whether
3
hours
a
week
would
be
enough.
the
issue
was
not,
well,
assuming
you
have
to
go
somewhere
else
and
out
of
this
public
school,
what
other
schools
would
you
recommend.
that
was
not
the
issue
at
the
hearing.
the
issue
was
whether
3
hours
is
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
school
district
said,
none
of
these
schools
is
any
good,
not
because
the
schools
are
not
qualified,
but
simply
because
we
insist
that
3
hours
a
week
is
enough.
you
don't
need
a
self-contained
program.
wasn't
that
their
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
was
never
really
put
to
the
school
district
the
question,
assuming...
assuming
that
i
don't
believe
you,
what
other
schools
would
you
recommend?
i
mean,
if
the
parents
would
be
willing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
accept
the
recommendations
of
people
who
already
thought
that
3
hours
a
week
for
this
child
was
enough.
what
other
schools
would
you
recommend?
that
question
was
never
put
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
response
to
that
was,
she
doesn't
need
any
more
than
3
hours
a
week.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
didn't
even
ask.
i
mean,
you
could
have
asked
someone,
couldn't
you,
come
in
and
asked?
i
don't
know
of
any
list
posted,
but
as
your
colleague
pointed
out,
even
if
there
was
a
list,
you'd
have
to
ask
somebody
for
the
list,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
didn't
ask
anybody
for
anything.
you
didn't
say,
you
know,
give
us
a
list
of
schools,
we
are
not
going
to
accept
your
3-hour-a-week
thing,
we
want
an
intensive
program,
give
us
a
list
of
schools.
you
didn't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
magic
difference
between
a
list
or
no
list?
the
fact
is,
you
didn't
ask.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
you're
still
taking
the
position
that
you
don't
have
a
right
to
go
to
any
school,
you
expect
them
to
come
forward...
you
don't
have
a
right
to
any
other
school
because
3
hours
enough.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
want
to
go
to
another
school,
here's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
contrary
to
human
nature.
they're
not
going
to
give
you
a
list
while
they're
still
contesting
the
substance
of
whether
you
have
a
right
to
go
anywhere
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
once
you
concede
that
you're
bound
by
a
list
that
the
schools
posts
your
case
becomes
a
lot
weaker.
i
don't
see
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
a
school
district
with
a
list
and
a
school
district
without
a
list.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
that.
that's
my
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
they
always
have
an
incentive
to
ask
for
a
list
anyway,
or
to
select
a
school
from
a
list
that
is
provided,
a
very
considerable
incentive,
don't
they?
that
is
to
say,
if
the
school
district
has
provided
a
list,
you
know
that
you
can
get
reimbursement
so
long
as
you
pick
one
of
those
schools.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
would
contest
it?
certainly
the
school
district
wouldn't
be
able
to
contest
it,
if
the
school
was
on
the
list.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
they
would
still
contest
the
iep--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
all
of
that,
but
they
certainly
couldn't
come
forward
and
say,
this
is
a
no-good
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ayer,
i
hate
to
take
part
of
it,
but
it's
an
important
point
to
me.
this
list
that
you
would
make
up
and
submit
to
the
parents
is
just
a
list
as
to
schools
that
meet
the
state
educational
standards.
it
isn't
a
list
of
those
schools
that
don't
charge
more
than
you're
willing
to
pay,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
cost.
