justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ayer,
you
made,
i
think,
a
very
helpful
and
candid
concession
in
your
reply
brief
in
which
you
say
there
are
situations
that
would
be
an
exception
to
this
strict
burlington
requirement
that
it
must
be
a
place
that
is
approved
by
the
district,
and
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
page
9
of
your
reply
brief
where
you
said,
in
the
second
full
paragraph,
that
the
court
should
not
allow
fape's
educational
standards
and
iep
requirement
to
foreclose
unreasonably
the
pursuit
of
educational
opportunity
through
the
unilateral
parent
placement
process
recognized
in
burlington.
so
you
seem
in
that
passage
to
be
recognizing
that
there
are
cases
where
there
can
be
deviations
from
both
the
iep
requirement,
the
fape
educational
standards,
so
doesn't
this
controversy,
then,
boil
down
to
whether
this
case
fits
that
description?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
this
case
there
was
no
list
supplied
by
the
public
school
authorities
as
there
was
in
burlington,
so
why
isn't
that
enough
to
make
it
exceptional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
shouldn't
there
be
a
burden
on
the
public
system
to
say
to
the
parents,
here
is
a
list
of
approved
private
facilities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
comes
down
to
who
has
the
burden
of
inquiry,
or
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
public
authority
has
to
supply
either
a
list
or
a
procedure,
and
you
say
no,
the
parent
has
to
ask,
and
if
the
parent
doesn't
ask,
then
there
is
effectively
no
recourse
for
the
parent
even
though
the
very
first
step
in
this
case
is
a
given...
that
is,
the
public
authority
has
not
been
able
to
provide
the
education
that
the
statute
requires.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
contending
that
the...
that
what
went
on
at
this
trident
school...
it
wasn't
an
iep,
but
there
were,
what
was
it,
goal-settings,
and
i
think
more
frequent
reviews...
that
that
wasn't
a
reasonable
substitute?
is
the
iep
so
much
more
intense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't
an
iep,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was
a
setting
of
goals
for
this
student
to
achieve,
and
an
evaluation
whether
the
student...
of
the
student's
progress
periodically,
was
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i'm
asking
you,
in
terms
of
quality,
was
it
substantially
less
effective
in
measuring
the
child's
progress
than
the
iep?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ayer,
did
i
take
it
that
your
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
you
before
was
that
if
these
parents
had
inquired,
if
they
had
only
inquired,
tell
us
a
school,
and
they
got
no
answer,
then
you
would
say,
yes,
then
they
would
be
entitled
to
reimbursement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
does
the
whole
thing
come
down
to
whether
the
state
has
to
provide
them
with
a
list,
or
a
process,
to
find
out
what
would
be
an
acceptable
school,
or
whether
the
parents
have
to
initiate
the
inquiry
in
the
first
place?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let
me
ask
you
the
question
in
a
different
way,
and
if
i...
this
is
the
way
i
see
it,
and
if
i'm
wrong
please
tell
me.
the
school
system
has
not
been
able
to
provide
the
child
with
an
education
that
the
statute
requires.
that's
a
given.
what
is
the
remedy
for
the
parent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case.
the
school
system
has
not
done
what
the
statute
requires.
the
parents
then
have
a
child
in
need
of
an
education.
what
is
the
remedy--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
the
default
on
the
part
of
the
public
school
system?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
these
parents
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
told
me
that
if...
that
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
these
parents
had
inquired
of
the
school
system,
is
there
a
place
that
satisfies
your
requirement
where
we
can
put
our
child,
and
you
said
that
what
the
case
comes
down
to
is
that
the
parents
failed
to
make
that
inquiry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
this
school
district
have
either
a
list
of
approved
places
or,
does
it
have
a
procedure
that
parents
can
use
to
find
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
shouldn't
it
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
school
district
is
in
default
because
it
has
not
provided
the
required
education,
why
shouldn't
it
be
incumbent
on
the
school
system
to
show
that
indeed
it
has
a
procedure?
rather
than
putting
the
burden
on
the
family
that
has
not
gotten
what
the
statute
entitles
it
to,
why
shouldn't
it
be
the
school
system's
responsibility
to
say,
either
we
maintain
a
list,
or
we
maintain
a
procedure
so
that
the
parents
will
have
an
effective
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wright,
in
view
of
the
expense
to
the
state,
and
it
is
quite
expensive...
what
was
the...
how
much
per
year,
30...
over
$30,000,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
it
is
an
expense
for
the
state
we
multiply
many
times
if
you
prevail.
why
isn't
it
equitable
to
require
the
parents
in
this
situation
to
say
to
the
school
system,
we
are
at
loggerheads
about
the
adequacy
of
what
you
are
offering,
and
we're
going
to
take
the
risk
to
send
our
child
elsewhere,
tell
us
what
schools
you
regard
as
adequate.
why
shouldn't
there
be
that
burden
of
inquiry,
as
mr.
ayer
suggested?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
parents
didn't
do
that.
they
simply
went
off
and
unilaterally
chose
trident.
they
didn't
ask...
they
didn't
ask
florence
county,
what
institutions
would
you
consider
adequate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
that
the
inquiry
that
mr.
ayer
said
might
have
made
this
case
different,
in
fact
happened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
in
the
record
of
the
administrative--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wright,
are
you
saying,
at
least
in...
there
was
no
list,
there
was
no
process
disclosed
to
you,
so
in
the
absence
of
those,
this
case
doesn't
have
to
go
to
the
further
question
suppose
there
had
been
a
list
and
it
wasn't
adequate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
burden
of
coming
forward
should
be
on
the
one
who
has
the
evidence,
that's
essentially
your
position--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
wax,
we're
going
back
now
to
the
setting
in
the
school
system
and
not
when
we're
in
court
talking
about
the
parents'
choice.
in
the
school
system,
isn't
the
thrust
of
the
act
that
the
parents
and
the
school
authority
should
be
trying
to
work
with
each
other
to
the
maximum
extent
possible,
rather
than
an
incentive
for
the
parents
to
pull
that
child
out
of
the
public
school
system
quickly
and
put
it
in
some
superior
private
school?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are,
in
effect,
asking
us
to
disapprove...
what
was
it,
the
second
circuit?
which
was
the
decision
that
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
have
to
pick
from
the
list?
