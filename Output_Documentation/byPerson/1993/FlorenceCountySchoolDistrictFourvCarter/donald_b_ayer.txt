mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
burlington
decision,
this
court
recognized
that
one
of
the
judicial
remedies
available
for
a
school
district's
failure
to
provide
an
education
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
individuals
with
disabilities
education
act
is
reimbursement
of
the
child's
parents
for
the
cost
of
removing
their
child
from
the
public
school
and
putting
he
or
she
into
a
private
school
that
provides
an
education
that
is
proper
under
the
act.
the
court
in
burlington
explained
that
conclusion
in
part
on
the
ground
that
where
parents
select
a
private
school
placement
that
is
found
to
be
"proper
under
the
act"
the
award
of
such
reimbursement
does
nothing
more
than
pay
the
parents
the
cost
that
should
have
been
paid
initially
by
the
public
school
for
the
placement
that
should
have
been
provided
in
the
first
place.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether,
as
the
court
below
held,
this
right
to
reimbursement
under
burlington
arises
wherever
the
private
placement
selected
by
the
parents
ultimately
proves
to
be
beneficial
to
the
child,
or
rather,
whether
such
placements
are
constrained,
as
are
all
other
placements
under
the
individuals
with
disabilities
education
act
by
the
obligation
to
provide
a
free
appropriate
public
education,
which
is
defined
precisely
and
specifically
in
the
act.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
1401(a)(18),
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
the
place--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the
place
to
begin
in
thinking
about
it
is
with
the
initial
section
of
the
act,
which
states
the
purpose
of
the
act,
and
it
states
that
purpose
very
explicitly
in
terms
of
assuring
that
all
children
with
disabilities
will
have
available
to
them
a
free,
appropriate
public
education.
that
is
the
overriding,
the
primary
purpose.
the
court
recognized
that
in
burlington.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
the
statute
does
not
explicitly
provide
for
the
burlington
remedy,
either,
and
so
the
fact
that
there
is
a
remedy
there
is
something
that
is
recognized
as
necessary
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
act,
so
i
can't
point
to
something
specifically
that
limits
a
remedy
that
is
not
explicitly
dealt
with
in
the
statute.
what
i
think
i
can
do--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
the
public
aspect
i
think
has
two
parts
within
the
definition,
one
is
that
it
be
a
public
expense,
and
that
is
certainly
possible,
and
the
other...
well,
there's
three,
i
guess.
the
other
is
that
it...
one
other
is
that
it
meets
state
standards.
that's
at
dispute
in
this
case.
and
then
the
third
is
that
it
be
under
public
supervision.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it
depends
how
you
define
public
supervision.
i
think
the
act
plainly
contemplates
and
placements
go
forward
i
think
on
a
regular
basis
in
private
schools
where
the
public
school
authorities
nonetheless
are
involved
in
that
process.
they're
involved
in
helping
to
prepare
an
individual
education
program,
and
that
i
think
fairly
satisfies
the
requirement
of
public
supervision.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--your
honor,
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
statute
that
dictates
in
what
manner
the
public
school
authorities
are
required
to
be
cooperative
with
the
parents.
it
might
be
that
they
have
a
list
prepared.
in
some
states
they
do.
if
they
have
such
a
list,
in
all
likelihood,
it's
going
to
be
necessary
for
the
parents
to
go
to
somebody
and
ask
for
it.
if
there
is
no
list,
it
is
in
the
same
way
necessary
for
the
parents
to
go
to
someone,
perhaps,
and
ask
the
question,
here's
what
i'd
like
to
do
under
my
burlington
rights,
i
want
to
put
the
child
in
a
private
school,
can
you
tell
me
whether
this
facility
meets
standards?
we
would
have
a
different
case
here
if
what
had
happened
was
the
parents
had
done
that
and
been
given
either
no
answer,
or
been
given
an
answer
which
is,
we
won't
cooperate
with
you,
we
won't
help
you.
that
might
be
a
case
where
you
could
say
that
the
realization
of
the
free
appropriate
public
education
simply
couldn't
realistically
be
accomplished
here
even
though
the
parents
tried
to
do
it.
the
fundamental--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i'd
like
to
take
a
couple
of
steps
back,
because
i
think
you
only
get
to
the
issue
that
you
are
raising,
which
is
whether
or
not
it
is
essentially
not
possible
to
accomplish
not
possible
for
the
parents
and
the
private
school
to
accomplish
the
objective
of
the
statute.
you
only
get
to
that
point
after
you
impose
an
initial
requirement,
presumptively
at
least,
that
a
free
appropriate
public
education
is
an
objective
to
which
the
parents
must
make
some
efforts
to
achieve,
and
i
want
to
just
talk
briefly
to
this
question
of
how
the
statute
operates,
and
the
fact,
first
of
all,
what
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
this
is
a
statute
that,
perhaps
unusually,
has
as
its
stated
primary
purpose
not
the
elevation
of
educational
quality
for
disabled
students,
not
some
general
objective
like
that,
the
primary
purpose
of
this
statute,
as
it
states
in
its
own
language,
is
the
assurance
that
all
children
with
disabilities
will
have
available
a
free,
appropriate
public
education.
what
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well
i
have
not,
i
have
not
heard,
i
have
not
seen
or
heard
of
that
notion
in
the
cases
justice
souter--
it
is
the
case
that
parents
can
take
their
child
out
of
the
public
system
and
pay
for
a
private
school
education
on
their
own.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no
i
think
it
is
for
the
benefits
of
the
students.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
this
goes
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
state
educational
authorities
were
intended
under
the
act
to
be
left
in
the
primary
role
with
regard
to
the
making
of
educational
policy.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
create
a
mechanism
that
relied
on
essentially
three
different
factors
to
assure
the
quality
of
education,
and
i
don't
think
that
they
assumed
that
parents
were
in
many...
in
most
instances
the
best
judges
of
what
would
be
a
quality
education.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it...
the
standard
that
is
applied,
as
i
was
saying
just
now,
there
are
three
elements,
essentially
that
the
statute
puts
in
place,
and
i
would
submit
they
work
like
the
legs
of
a
stool
to
elevate
together
the
quality
of
education.
one
of
them
is
the
requirement
that
state
educational
standards
be
met
in
the
educations
provided
to
disabled
students,
and
i
think
that's
very
important,
because
what
was
happening
before
was
that
disabled
students
were
in
many
instances
simply
being
pushed
aside
or
being
given
a
clearly
inferior
education,
so
the
notion
is
not
that
we're
going
to
tell
the
states
what
policies
to
put
in
place,
but
that
we're
going
to
require
that
they
treat
disabled
students
no
less
favorably
than
they
treat
nondisabled
students.
the
second
is
the
iep
process,
which
in
this
statute
was
very
explicitly
spelled
out.
this
is
not,
if
you
read
through
the
language
of
it,
a
general
reference
to
the
notion
that,
and
there
should
be
some
sort
of
discussion
between
the
parents
and
the
school
officials.
this
is
a
very
explicit
set
of
requirements
which
congress
believed
was
necessary
in
conjunction
with
the
other
factors
that
it
was
putting
into
the
statute
in
order
to
accomplish
the
result.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
view
what
went
on
at
trident
as
complying
with
the
act,
because
it
says
explicitly
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
wasn't
an
iep.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
what
is
missing
from
that,
from
what
you've
described,
and
i
think,
your
honor,
you
have
accurately
described
what
is
in
the
decisions
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
process
there
is.
there
is
absolutely
no
discussion
of
the
critical
part
of
the
iep
process,
which
is
a
cooperative
interaction,
a
give-and-take
between
the
parents
and
the
school.
there
is
no
discussion
of
a
written
statement
of
the
services
to
be
provided.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
the
case,
your
honor.
i
think...
i
think
that
this
raises
the
question
of,
in
what
kind
of
circumstances
might
an
exception
be
made
to
the
free
appropriate
public
education
requirement.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
don't
think
it
comes
down
to
that,
your
honor,
i
think
the
first
issue
must
be
whether
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
which
is
that
the
free
appropriate
public
education
requirement
is
entirely
inapplicable
in
the
burlington
context,
with
the
one
exception
of
the
requirement
that
the
education
provide
educational
benefit.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
in
this
case?
in
any
cases?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the
parents
have
the
right
to
remove
the
child,
as
was
indicated
from...
in
burlington,
to
remove
the
child
from
the
public
school
and
find
an
alternative
placement.
the
issue
here--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the
issue
here
is
whether
the
parents,
in
doing
so,
the
parents
nonetheless
are
governed
by
the
requirement
of
the
act
and
the
primary
purpose
of
the
act,
which
was
to...
is
to
achieve
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
is
primarily
to
benefit
the
children.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
is
a
relevant
fact,
your
honor,
i
think
first
with
regard
to
the
requirement
of
meeting
state
standards,
that
whereas
the
primary
purpose
is
to
benefit
the
children,
a
secondary
purpose
which
is
made
explicit
in
the
statute
and
which
this
court
has
recognized
is
to
leave
state
authorities
as
the
primary
authorities
in
determining
educational
standards.
that
purpose
is
frustrated
by
the
result
that's
been
reached
here.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
think...
i
think
that's
a
false
hypothesis,
your
honor.
i
don't...
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that...
well,
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
on
the
iep
requirement
that
the
statute...
any
fair
reading
of
the
statute
does
not
contemplate
that
in
a
usual
setting
in
a
public
school
that
if
the
parents
and
the
teachers
sit
down
and
parents
and
the
school
authorities
sit
down
and
they
say,
well,
now,
we're
going
to
be
funding
this
under
the
idea,
but
you'd
just
as
soon
not
do
an
iep,
wouldn't
you?
we'd
just
as
soon
not
write
one,
you'd
just
as
soon
not
have
one,
let's
just
forget
about
it,
and
we'll
go
ahead
and
fund
this
with
federal
money
without
complying
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
i
do
not
believe
that
that's
consistent
with
what
the
authors
of
the
statute
had
in
mind.
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--yes.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
the--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--yes.
the
third
leg
is
the
standard
of
what
constitutes
an
appropriate
education,
as
the
word
is
used
in
the
act,
and
in
rowley--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the
first
two
legs,
your
honor,
were
the
requirement
that
the
education
meet
state
educational
standards,
the
second
was
that
it
be
provided
in
compliance
with
the
iep
requirement,
and
the
third
is
that
it
be
"appropriate".
now,
this
court
in
rowley,
in
considering
what
constitutes
an
appropriate
education,
focused
on
the
fact
that
there
are
other
procedural
and
other
requirements
under
the
act
and
adopted
a
standard
which
i
think
by
any
fair
reading
is
a
fairly
low
level
standard.
that
is
to
say,
it
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
the
education
was
capable
or
calculated
to
provide
educational
benefit.
that
in
itself
i
think
plainly
is
not
an
effective
support
to
a
statute
that
is
trying
to
elevate
the
quality
of
disabled
children's
education.
the
statute
has
in
mind
something
else.
the
statute
has
in
mind
these
things
working
together.
it
has
in
mind,
under
the
educational
standard
requirement,
essentially
a
nondiscrimination
provision
that
says,
you
can't
treat
the
disabled
children
worse
than
you
treat
the
other
children.
if
you
have
teachers
certified
in
the
areas
they're
teaching
for
other
children,
you've
got
to
have
similar
kinds
of
certification.
and
that's...
the
certification
point
which
is
at
issue
here
is
a
very
significant
part
of
the
statute.
it's
addressed
specifically
in
the
regulations
and
in
the
statute,
indicating
at
one
point
in
the
statute...
i
think
it's...
1413(a)(14)
talks
about
with
regard
to
disabled
children,
if
you
are
not
hiring
teachers
in
accordance
with
the
highest
standards
in
the
state,
number
1
you're
supposed
to
do
that
for
disabled
children,
and
if
you're
not,
you've
got
to
give
an
explanation
as
to
what
you're
doing
to
get
up
to
that
standard.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
you
mean,
before
burlington
was
decided?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
can't
tell
you
what
i
would
be...
i
wasn't
involved
in
that
case,
and
i
don't
know
what
i'd
be
arguing.
it's
not
the
same
case
as
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
would
just
again
ask
the
question,
do
we
believe
that
they
are
waivable
in
the
context
of
a
public
school
placement?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
your
honor,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
it
would
come
out
a
different
way.
it
would
be
a
different
case,
because
it
would
have
triggered
a
different
process.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
doesn't
have
a
list,
and
whether
or
not
it
has
a
procedure
in
terms
of
a
way
that
parents
could
get
that
information,
we
don't
know,
and
the
reason
we
don't
know
is
that
any
effort
was...
no
effort
was
taken.
the
procedure
would
be
to
pick
up
the
phone--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--and
ask
the
question.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think...
this
is
a
case
where
what
occurred
was
that,
while
the
review
process
under
the
statute
was
going
forward,
the
parents,
completely
on
their
own
and
without
any
conversation
with
the
school,
and
without
telling
the
school
district
authorities
that
they
were
doing
it
before
they
did
it,
they
took
the...
they
applied
to
the
trident
school,
they
took
the
child
out
of
the
school,
and
they
put
her
into
the
trident
school,
so
that
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--your
honor,
i
think
that's...
i
think
it's
a
bit
of
an
oversimplification
to
say
that
they
decided
not
to
provide
the
services.
the
bottom
line
is,
there's
been
a
finding
that
what
they
offered
wasn't
meeting
the
standards
under
the
act.
the
one
answer
i
would
give
goes
back
to
what
is
the
explicit
purpose
of
the
act,
and
congress
must
have
had
something
in
mind
when
it
said
that
it
wants
to
assure
a
free,
appropriate
public
education
to
all
children,
meaning--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
you
can
case
it
as
an
abuse
of
discretion.
i
think
the
key
point
is,
is
the
rule
announced
by
the
court
of
appeals
consistent
with
the
objectives
and
language...
the
purpose,
explicitly
stated,
and
language
of
the
act...
and
i
would
submit
that
inasmuch
as
the
purpose,
as
stated,
is
to
create
this,
as
i
described
it,
three-legged
stool
to
elevate
the
quality
of
education,
what
we
have
created
here
with
this
rule,
not
simply
in
this
case,
but
with
the
rule
amounts,
simply
saying,
all
you
have
to
do
is
show
that
you've
found
an
education
that
is
going
to
provide
educational
benefit,
we
are
going
to
have
a
lot
of
placements
that
are
publicly
funded,
federally
funded
under
the
act
in
part
and
state-funded
to
a
significant
degree.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i...
it
is
ultimately
a
question
of
whether
discretion
has
been
abused.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
general
rule
is
that
the
education
that's
going
to
be
publicly
funded
must
meet
the
standards
of
a
free
appropriate--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
the
general
rule,
and
the
only
exception
to
that,
i
think,
is
going
to
be--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
we
do
recognize
the
possibility
that
where
there's...
as
in
honig,
where
there's
a
substantial
showing
that
accomplishing
the
purposes
of
the
act
is
not
going
to
be
possible,
or
has
been
prevented--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--it
might
well.
i
think...
because
what
that
would
do
would
be
to
initiate
a
process
where
the
school
authorities
could
address
that
issue,
and
it
might
produce
something
else.
the
point
is
here,
the
parents
walked
away,
and
there
has
not
been
a
cooperative
process.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
but
they
also...
they
also
understood,
justice
stevens,
that
they
have
obligations
under
burlington,
that
there
are
burlington
rights,
and
i
think
it's
really
unreasonable
to
think
that
school
districts
are
simply
going
to
ignore
the
fact
that
parents
have
these
rights.
if
it's
possible,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
weren't
proposing
to
make
up
a
list,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--but
if
someone
were
to
make
a
list
that
reflected
state
standards,
it
would
only
reflect
state
standards.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
that
list
would
not,
and
you
could
have
another
list
that
would.
but
three
points
i'd
like
to
make
very
quickly,
and
one
is
that
i
must
take
exception
to
the
proposition
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
provide
an
appropriate
education
as
that
word
is
defined
in
rowley.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
provide
a
fape,
a
free
appropriate
public
education,
which
is,
i
think,
a
good
bit
more
than
an
appropriate
education,
which
is
one
that
simply
confers
some
benefit.
second,
i
would
also
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
the
obligation
and
the
intention
of
the
statute
that
their
be
cooperation
ends
as
soon
as
the
iep
is
signed.
indeed,
it's
a
continuing
process
that's
intended
to
go
on
into
the
future,
and
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--thank
you,
your
honor.
