well,
mr.
ayers,
the...
it's
defined,
i
guess,
in
section
1401?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
that
provision
is
applicable
at
all
to
private
placements?
it
seems
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--cover,
really,
state
placements--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
state
provision
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
okay.
i
recognize
that,
and
i'd
like
you
to
tell
us,
if
you
will,
where
in
the
statute
specifically
it
covers
private
placement,
or
whether
this
is
just
something
by
way
of
a
remedy
that
the
courts
have
developed
under
the
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
ayer,
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
public
school
failed
to
provide
the
free
appropriate
public
school
education.
i
mean,
we
take
that
as
a
given.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
those
circumstances,
does
it
boil
down,
in
effect,
to
whether
the
courts
below
abused
their
discretion
in
ordering
the
remedy
they
did?
is
that
what
we're
really
looking
at
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
could
well
be
that
there
is
language
under
the
opinion
that
goes
further
than
perhaps
you
think
it
should,
but
at
bottom
you
have
a
judgment
in
favor
of
reimbursement
of
these
parents,
and
do
we
review
that
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.--
--now,
i--
--are
you
through?
mr.
wright,
if
we
had
a
situation
where
the
school
district
or
the
state
had
an
approved
list
of
private
schools
to
which
private
placements
could
be
made
that
met
state
standards,
do
you
think
the
parents
have
an
obligation
under
this
statutory
scheme
to
make
a
placement
if
they
want
reimbursement
in
one
of
the
listed
private
facilities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
should
the
parents
have
an
obligation
to
inquire,
do
you
have
a
list?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
ms.
wax,
do
you
think
there's
no
limit
at
all
here?
suppose
you're
in
a
community
where
there
are
a
number
of
private
schools
that
could
do
the
job,
and
one
of
them
has
an
annual
tuition
of
$30,000
a
year,
it's
really
a
cadillac
situation,
and
another
school
that
maybe
could
do
the
job
has
a
tuition
of
$10,000
a
year.
now,
the
parent
is
entirely
free
to
choose
the
most
expensive
and
the
school
district
has
to
pick
up
the
cost?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
your
view?
there
are--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--no
cautionary
concerns
here
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
under
the
statutory
scheme
a
court
could
deny
full
reimbursement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
you
do?
how?
on
what
authority?
