mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
we
get
into
the
issues,
i'd
like
to
take
a
moment
to
review
some
of
the
factual
questions
that
are
important
in
responding
to
mr.
ayers.
in
1983,
when
shannon
was
13
years
old,
she
entered
the
seventh
grade
at
timmonsville
school.
her
mother
told
the
school
officials
that
shannon
could
not
read
and
requested
that
she
be
evaluated.
the
school
system
evaluated
her,
concluded
that
she
was
lazy,
unmotivated,
a
slow
learner
who
needed
to
be
pressured
harder
to
work.
relying
upon
that,
the
parents
pressured
their
daughter.
by
february
of
1985,
she
was
16,
functionally
illiterate,
had
become
suicidal,
and
was
severely
depressed.
her
parents
obtained
counseling
for
her.
the
counselor
recommended
that
shannon
receive
a
complete
psychological
evaluation.
the
results
found
that
shannon
had
a
severe
learning
disability
and
intense
educational
services
were
recommended.
following
this,
the
school
did
evaluate
shannon
and
concurred
that
shannon
had
a
severe
learning
disability
and
was
average
to
above
average
in
intelligence.
at
a
conference
with
parents
and
school
personnel,
an
individualized
educational
program
was
presented
to
the
parents
that
proposed
a
resource
program
for
shannon.
this
resource
class
would
be
one
where
shannon
was
going
to
be
placed
with
emotionally
disturbed
and
mentally
retarded
children.
the
parents
said
that
was
not
appropriate
for
shannon.
the
school
then
offered
an
itinerant
program.
this
program
consisted
of
3
hours
of
special
education
a
week,
and
after
a
year
in
the
tenth
grade
as
a
17-year-old,
her
reading
still
would
have
remained
at
the
fifth
grade
level,
and
she
would
have
fallen
further
and
further
behind
her
peer
group.
the
parents
contended
that
this--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--absolutely.
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
the
school
board
said,
we
will
have
you
reading
half...
5
months
more,
after
a
year's
worth
of
intense
special
education
program.
the
parents
said
that
was
not...
inadequate,
and
based
upon
the
advice
of
the
evaluators
that
were
working
with
the
family
and
with
shannon,
requested
at
that
time
a
self-contained
learning
disabled
program
such
as
the
one
that
was
offered
right
down
the
road
in
florence
county
school
district
one.
now,
florence
county
has
multiple
school
districts,
and
this
is
a
case
against
district
four,
not
against
florence
county
itself.
district
four
refused
to
consider
placing
shannon
in
any
public
or
private
self-contained
program.
the
parents
then
requested
a
special
education
due
process
hearing.
at
the
august
20
due
process
hearing,
the
carters
requested
funding
for
either
two
neighboring
schools
or
trident
academy,
a
special
educational
school
accredited
by
the
southern...
excuse
me,
southern
association
of
colleges
and
schools.
the
issue
at
the
special
education
due
process
hearing
and
before
the
district
court
judge
was
whether
or
not
district
four's
itinerant
program
was
appropriate.
the
trial
court
not
only
found
that
district
four's
program
was
inadequate,
but
also
found
that
trident
academy
provided
shannon
with
an
excellent
education.
she--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--it
was
not
an
issue
at
either
the
due
process
hearing
or
the
u.s.
district
court.
the
issue
was
simply,
our
itinerant
program
3
hours
a
week
is
appropriate
and
adequate.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
about...
the
issue
of
trident
not
being--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
it
was--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--it
was
never
contended.
it
was
simply,
our
3
hours
a
week
are
appropriate,
and
therefore...
and
if
they
proved
that,
if
they
had
proved
that
3
hours
a
week
was
appropriate,
then
of
course,
the
parents
had
no
remedy
under
burlington,
and
so
that
was
the
issue
of
the
case.
thus
you'll
see
the
record
is
fairly
incomplete
on
a
number
of
the
other
issues
dealing
with
information
about
trident.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
over
3
years
it
was
$30,000.
actually,
it
was
about...
the
actual
tuition
was
about
$6,000
or
$7,000,
only
$2,000
or
$3,000
more
than
it
would
have
cost
the
public
school
themselves.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
i
think
that's
a
proper
burden.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
the
record
at
the
administrative
due
process
hearing...
not
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
in
the
due
process
hearing,
will
show
the
parents
said,
"can
our
daughter
go
to
hartsville,
down
the
road,
district
1,
darlington,
or
trident?
"
that
was
the
issue
at
the
due
process
hearing.
the
itinerant
program
is
not
good
enough
for
our
daughter,
we
want
her
to
read
at
the
twelfth
grade
level
when
she
graduates.
that
was
what
the
battle
was
all
about,
so
her
parents...
and
that
was
august
20,
before
school
had
even
started,
and
shannon
had
not
been
placed
anywhere.
if
public--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--three
hours
a
week
is
appropriate,
1/2-a-year's
gain
over
a
year
is
appropriate.
the
parents...
reasonable
parents,
what
else
could
they
do?
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
absolutely.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
the
due
process
hearing,
the
trial...
the
actual
testimony
before
the
administrative
hearing
officer.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
it's...
it
was
a
part,
of
course,
of
the
trial
court's
record,
the
u.s.
district
court
judge,
and
parts
of
the
due
process
testimony
are
within
the
court
of
appeals
joint
appendix.
i
don't
recall
whether
the
three
schools...
darlington,
hartsville
and
trident
academy
are
clearly
in
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
or
not,
but
that's...
i
represent
to
the
court
that
it
is
clearly
in
the
due
process
transcript,
absolutely.
i
say
that
without
a
doubt.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
no,
sir.
at
the
due
process
hearing,
august
20,
the
parents
said--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--we
want
self-contained,
3
hours
a
week
are
not
adequate,
our
daughter
needs
total
immersion.
the
school
system
said,
our
program
is
appropriate.
three
hours
a
week
is
all
that
your
daughter
needs.
the
parents
did
not
want
to
send
their
daughter
down
to
charleston,
or
mount
pleasant,
south
carolina.
they
wanted
down
the
street,
next
school
district.
florence
county
includes
a
major
city
and
rural
counties,
and
then
there
are
school
districts
as
a
part
of
each
one,
and
district
1...
this
is
in
the
record.
district
1
had
other
self-contained
programs,
and
the
trial
judge
referenced
that
the
school
system
had
that
available,
in
effect,
and
the
record
is--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--i
believe
it
would
be
florence,
south
carolina.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
well,
no,
it
did
go
beyond
that.
the
parents...
the
school
system's
position
was
3
hours
was
enough.
the
parents
said,
no.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
in
other
words,
they
put
blinders
on
to
anything
beyond
3
hours
a
week.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
not
in
quite
those
words,
but
why
can't
daughter
go
down
the
road
to
district
1
and
why
can't
you
simply
pay
district
1,
what
you--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--exactly.
exactly.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
i
think
they
would,
given
the
assumption,
as
a
part
of
your
question,
that
the
school
system
said
here
is
our
list
of
approved
schools.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
yes.
yes,
parents,
certainly,
if
a
public
school
says,
we
are
offering
resource
or
itinerant,
we
know
you
want
self-contained
daily,
or
self-contained
private,
we
don't
agree
with
you
but
here
is
a
list,
i
would
submit
that
the
parents
would
be
obligated
to
evaluate
the
list
and
go
back
to
the
school
system
and
see
if
they
can
negotiate
it.
it's
supposed
to
be
a
cooperative
type
of
a
venture
with--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--well,
needless
to
say,
those
aren't
the
facts
in
this
case,
and
there
is
a--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--that's
a
difficult
question,
as
you're
perhaps
aware,
the
second
circuit
has
wrestled
with,
the
fifth
circuit
has
wrestled
with,
and
if
this
preexisting
list
in
fact
is
not
appropriate
as
a
matter
of
true
fact,
what
do
parents
do?
new
york
state,
they
get
appropriate
educations,
but
it's
not
free.
they
pay
for
it
out
of
pocket,
or
they
get
a
free
appropriation,
it's
not
appropriate,
but
i'm
not
going
to
ask
you
today
as
a
part
of
the
carter
case
to
go
beyond
that.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
one
of
the
friend-of-the-court
briefs
that
was
filed
by
the
maryland
disability
law
center,
they
synthesized
what
the
problems
were
with,
for
example,
there's
a
case,
jack
strothy,
where
there
was...
the
schools
on
the
list
were
obviously
absolutely
inappropriate,
and
the
trial
district
court
judge
said,
my
hands
are
tied.
i
cannot
reimburse
you.
you
received
an
appropriate
education.
i'm
real
sorry
it
was
not
free,
and
the--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--i
can
only
respond...
i
can't
respond
any
better
than
perhaps
the
carrington
court
did
and
alamo
heights,
saying
that
you
have
to
balance
on
a
case-by-case
basis
the
cooperativeness
of
the
parents,
whether
or
not
the
school
system
truly
defaulted
under
their
obligations--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--there
would
be
problems
with
it,
absolutely,
and
hopefully
what
that
would
then
result
would
be
school
systems
back,
for
example,
with
shannon
carter
in
'83,
when
they
have
a
learning
disabled
child
doing
good
quality
work
at
that
point,
making
a
finding,
saving
dollars
by
providing
appropriate
education
then,
or
in
'85
when
the
parents
requested
a
more
comprehensive--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--yes,
sir,
it's
created--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
here.
no
list,
the
parents
had
no
knowledge
of
one,
and
in
fact
the
state
did
not
have
a
list,
doesn't
even
have
a
process
where
a
private
school
can
apply
to
the
state
to
see
what
it
takes
to
get
on
this
list,
because
it
is
a
nonexistent
list.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
parents,
i
don't
believe...
the
answer's
no.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
the
parents
did
not
do
that.
the
parents
said,
we
want
trident
or
two
other
programs.
the
public
school,
i
submit
to
you--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--the
burden
would
be
to
the
school
system,
when
they
knew
parents
were
seeking
trident,
to
say,
well,
if
you
want
approval
for
trident,
here
is
the
procedure
that
has
to
be
followed,
here
are
the
requirements.
i
would
submit
this,
parents
are
not
under
a
burden
to
inquire
about
a
list
that
they
would
have
no
knowledge...
they're
not
going
to
know
the
technical
requirements
of
the
special
ed
act.
certainly,
educators
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
do
that,
and
can
say,
we
don't
agree,
but
we
can
agree
to
disagree,
here
is
the
remedy
that
you
have
to
follow.
it
did
not
happen
in
this--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--not
the
one
who
has
the
evidence,
the
one
who
is
in
the
better
position.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
the
one
who's
educated.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
it
becomes
a--
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
--and
if
they
don't
give
a
list
and
parents
then
obtain
a
placement
that
later
is
determined
to
be
appropriate,
and
the
public
school's
program
is
inadequate,
the
school
is
a
master
of
their
own
destiny,
they
saw
fit
not
to
provide
this
list,
then
the
parents
should
not
be
held
accountable
for
that.
parents
should
still
be
able
to
receive
an
appropriate
education
that
is
also
free.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
i'm
not
here
today
arguing
against
lists
per
se.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
but
i
think
that's
a
difficult
part
of
the
entire
case.
if
the
school
system
already
had
a
list
in
existence
and
had
already
furnished
a
list
to
the
parents
and
provided
them
with
procedures
to
seek
approval
for
trident,
this
would
be
a
different
case,
absolutely
no
question
at
all
about
that.
mr.
peter
w.
d.
wright
that's
correct.
trident
academy
had
three
other
south
carolina
youngsters
that
were
placed
there
by
south
carolina
school
system
and
paid
for.
approval
in
south
carolina
is
case
by
case,
and
you
will
also
see
this
issue
of
certified
teachers.
if
you
look
at
the
south
carolina
regs,
the
last
page
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
allows
for
noncertified
teachers
to
teach
special
ed,
exactly
what
they're
complaining
and
condemning
trident
for.
in
essence,
when
shannon
graduated,
she
was
reading
at
the
twelfth
grade
level.
the
education
was
appropriate.
it's
not
been
free
at
this
point,
and
we
ask
that
you
provide
shannon
with
a
free
appropriation
also.
thank
you.
