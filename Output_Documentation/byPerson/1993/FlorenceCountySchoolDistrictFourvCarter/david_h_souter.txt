justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
interrupt
you
there?
isn't
the
point
that
the
statute
or
the
conditions
that
we're
concerned
with
here
are
all
conditions
which
are
intended
to
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
students.
it's
to
make
sure
that
the
kids
with
disabilities
do
not
get
stuck
down
in
some...
some
second-rate
status,
and
if
the
purpose
of
the
various
conditions
that
are
in
question
here
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
students,
then
under
burlington
isn't
it
at
least
possible
for
the
students,
or
the
parents
of
the
students,
to
waive
those,
or
you
might
say
ignore
them,
so
that
that
waiver
or
ignoring
of
them
would
not
be
a
per
se
disqualification
for
reimbursement.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me,
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
do
you
claim
that
either
of
the
conditions
in
question
here,
either
the
requirement
of
iep
or
the
requirement
of
teacher
certification,
is
for
the
benefit
of
anyone
other
than
the
student?
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
if
then
the
students
or
their
parents
say
well
we'll
waive
those
so
long
as
we
can
get,
in
fact,
an
adequate
education
elsewhere,
why
shouldn't
they
be
allowed
to
waive
them
and
why
should
their
waiver
be
a
bar
to
reimbursement?
justice
david
h.
souter
ah,
the
best
judge
is
going
to
be
the
judge
in
a
contested
case
for
reimbursement
afterwards,
or
if
not
the
best
judge,
an
adequate
judge.
i
mean,
the
scheme
that
the
other
side
is
claiming
does
not
leave
them
in
the
unreviewable
driver's
seat.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
go
back
to
the
purpose
again,
because
i
don't
think
you've
answered
one
of
the
questions
that
we
keep
asking,
and
that
is,
for
whose
benefit
are
these
conditions
which
collectively
make
up
the
purpose?
the
benefit
of
the
stay-put
provision
in
burlington
was
supposedly,
or
was
treated
as
being...
the
object
of
the
stay-put
provision
was
being
to
serve
the
children
so
that
they
did
not
get
side-tracked
into
some
inappropriate
class
while
the
fight
was
going
on
about
what
to
do.
isn't
the
benefit
of
the...
the
object,
rather,
of
the
two
provisions
that
you
were
most
concerned
with
in
making
up
the
collective
purpose
of
this
statute
also
to
benefit
the
children?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
a
relevant
fact,
then,
in
deciding
to
what
extent
those
conditions
may
be
waived
and
to
what
extent
they
may
be
waived
consistently
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
you
can't
satisfy
each
of
them?
which
purpose
wins
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is...
it
is
if
you
are
correct
that
the
conditions
are
in
effect
enforceable
conditions
without
any
possibility
of
waiver.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
in
effect
assumes
the
answer
to
the
question
that
is
before
the
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
logic
essentially
the
same,
and
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
argue
in
the
face
of
burlington
consistently
with
the
burlington
logic
that
these
provisions
are
so
obviously
nonwaivable,
or
nonmalleable,
and
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
i
thought
in
your
reply
brief
you
were
conceding
as
much.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
the
state's
response?
justice
david
h.
souter
now--
--obligated
to
consult
the
list,
or
absolutely
obligated
to
remain
within
the
schools
in
the
list
in
choosing
the
placement
they
wanted?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
understood...
and
maybe...
i
don't
want
to
unduly
complicate
it.
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
was
that
they
would
be
obligated,
in
effect,
to
look
at
the
list
first,
but
they
would
not
necessarily
be
obligated
to
send
the
child
to
one
of
those
schools.
if
they
concluded
that
the
school...
none
of
the
schools
on
the
list
was
adequate,
and
they
turned
out
after
the
fact
on
judicial
review
to
be
correct,
your
position
would
be
the
same,
representing
those
parents,
that
it
is
representing
these,
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
don't
ask
me,
but
i
was
asking
you--
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
--whether
your
position
would
be
the
same,
and
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
me
that
it
would
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
the
principle
that
you
contend
for
today
untie
his
hands?
if
in
fact
they've
consulted
the
list,
and
if
in
fact,
a)
they
have
concluded
that
the
schools
are
inappropriate
for
whatever
the
need
is,
and
on
subsequent
judicial
review
and
a
reimbursement
action
the
trial
court
likewise
concludes,
isn't
the
principle
that
you
contend
for
today
a
principle
that
would
say
they
are
entitled
to
reimbursement?
