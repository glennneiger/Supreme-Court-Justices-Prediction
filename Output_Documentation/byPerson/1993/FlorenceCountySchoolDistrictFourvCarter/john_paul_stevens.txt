mr.
ayer,
a
little
while
ago
you
told...
started
to
tell
us
about
a
three-legged
stool.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
told
us
what
the
first
two
legs
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
never
got
to
the
third.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
ayer,
i
thought
your
position
was
that
if
the
school
in
which
the
child
is
placed
does
not
meet
the
state
standard,
there's
no
reimbursement,
period.
i
thought
that
was
your
position.
am
i
wrong,
that
if--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
it
doesn't,
there's
no
reimbursement
to
the
parents.
i
thought
that
was
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
only
the
general
rule,
that's
the
rule
you
say
the
statute
requires,
as
i
understand
it,
in
all
cases.
i
believe
you
did
recognize
an
exception
in
your
reply
brief,
that
there
could
be
extraordinary
cases,
and
the
question
was
whether
this
was
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
think
this
case
would
be
any
different
if
before
making
the
placement
the
parents
had
gone
to
the
school
authorities
and
said,
we
propose
to
put
the
child
in
this
particular
school,
and
they
said,
well,
you
know,
there
are
two
teachers
there
that
aren't
certified,
and
we,
of
course,
have
put
some
of
our
placements
there,
but
we
want
you
to
know
that
there
are
two
uncertified
teachers?
would
that
make
the
case
any
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
school's
position
was
that
the
program
at
its
school
was
sufficient.
they
weren't
arguing
about
where
to
place
the
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
it
that's
in
the
transcript,
that
they
told
them
they
were
going
to
place
the
child
at
trident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
asked
whether
these
three
schools
might
be
proper
placement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there...
just
refresh
my
recollection
about
one
aspect
of
the
facts.
didn't...
wasn't
trident
used
by
the
school
districts
and
other
parts
of
the
state
as
a
place
to
send
their
children?
