mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court
incorrectly
held
that
florida's
legislative
districting
plan
violates
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
by
diluting
the
votes
of
hispanics
living
in
dade
county.
the
florida
plan
provides
dade
county
hispanics
with
a
proportional
share
of
majority
districts,
and
we
submit
that
such
an
allocation
necessarily
gives
them
the
same
opportunity
as
others
to
elect
voters,
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice,
which
is
all
that
section
2,
by
its
terms,
requires.
the
united
states
agrees
with
us
that
proportionality
is
sufficient,
but
it
argues
that
we
must
show
proportionality
with
respect
to
all
hispanics
in
florida,
not
just
those
living
in
dade
county.
but
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
it's
flatly
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
gingles,
which
held
that
any
group
claiming
vote
dilution
must
show
that
it
is
sufficiently
large
and
geographically
compact
to
constitute
a
majority
in
a
single-member
district.
in
florida,
there's
only
one
such
group
of
hispanics
who
can
meet
that
threshold
requirement,
and
those
are
the
hispanics
living
in
dade
county,
and
they,
as
i've
said,
already
have
proportional
representation.
the
remaining
hispanics
in
florida
are
so
geographically
diverse
that
it
is
impossible
to
construct
anything
remotely
resembling
a
compact
district
in
which
they
could
be
a
majority.
now,
the
united
states'
response
is,
well,
you
can
create
more
districts
for
hispanics
in
dade
county.
but
that
simply
misses
the
point
of
gingles,
which
is,
in
the
absence
of
compactness,
the
state
plan
simply
doesn't
dilute
hispanic
votes,
and
therefore
there's
no
violation
under
section
2
and
no
remedial
districts
in
any
location
are
required.
the
united
states'
argument
also
has
the
other
problem
of
being
incompatible
with
the
text
of
section
2,
which
protects
a
right
to
elect
representatives,
not
a
right
to
have
representatives
elected
by
others
of
the
same
race
who
may
live
hundreds
of
miles
away
in
the
state.
a
concept
that
the
united
states
calls,
quote,
virtual
representation,
but
which
is
nowhere
mentioned
in
the
statute,
legislative
history,
or
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
addressing
section
2.
so,
if
i
can,
let
me
state
the
principle
that
we
think
governs
the
appeal,
and
that
is
that
a
state
plan
satisfies
section
2
if
it
provides
a
proportional
share
of
majority
districts
to
each
geographically
compact
group
of
minorities,
something
that
the
florida
plan
indisputably
does.
if
i
might,
now,
let
me
return--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
you
have
to
reject
it
in
the
following
sense.
unless
you
can
show
reasonable
geographic
compactness
throughout
the
state,
which
you
might
be
able
to
show
in
a
case
like
bandemer
where
there
were
59
percent
democrats
or
republicans.
unless
you
can
show
that,
i
think
you
have
to
reject
it
and
i
think
gingles
requires
it.
so
i
think
that
is
my
position.
and,
indeed,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
if
one
looks
at
the
array
of
voting
rights
cases,
from
'65
forward,
frankly,
they
are
always
brought
locale
by
locale.
they
may
be
a
multidistrict
situation,
but
they're
not
brought
in
a
statewide
basis
for
precisely
this
reason.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
agree
with
you,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
proof
in
this
case
was
limited
to
dade
county.
and
i
think
it's
sufficient
to
dispose
of
this
appeal.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it
is.
i
do
want
to
make
the
added
point...
it
absolutely
enough,
but
i
do
want
to
make
the
added
point
that
there
would
be
no
possible
reason
for
a
remand.
because
it's
not
just
a
failure
of
proof,
it's
that
you
cannot
prove
geographical
compactness,
a
fact
that
the
united
states
concedes
by
suggesting
that
you
basically
concentrate
additional
districts
in
dade
county.
but
i
think
you're
exactly
right,
justice
o'connor,
and
that's
why
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
district
court's
opinion,
which,
after
all,
is
the
case
that
brought
us
up
here
on
appeal.
and
make
no
mistake
about
it--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--absolutely.
the
united
states
contests
otherwise,
but
i
think
there's
no
support
in
the
record.
first
of
all,
the
district
court's
opinion,
of
course,
talks
only
about
dade
county.
it
made
the
gingles
compactness,
the
gingles
cohesion,
and
the
gingles
white-bloc
voting
findings
in
dade
county.
it
found
vote
dilution
of
voters
in
dade
county.
the
united
states
went
first.
they
had
the
burden
of
proof.
they
put
on
evidence
only
about
dade
county.
we
moved
for
a
directed
verdict.
they
said
they
proved
gingles
in
dade
county.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
that
record
the
only
issue
is
vote
dilution
in
dade
county.
now,
as
to
that,
which
the
district
court,
in
fairness,
did
address.
where
its
error
is
is
in
its
notion
that
somehow
proportionality
isn't
a
defense.
the
district
court
said,
look,
we
applied
gingles
two
and
three,
and
we
find
that
there's
cohesion
and
white-bloc
voting.
we
can
create
more
districts
than
the
state
did
in
dade
county,
and
so
we're
going
to
impose
11
rather
than
9
districts.
that
is,
of
course,
a
maximization
principle,
and
it
would
apply
equally
well
to
any
municipality.
if
you
had
a
city
council
with
five
people
on
there
and
you
had
a
40
percent
minority
in
the
city,
if
they
lived
compactly
you
could
create,
just
as
a
matter
of
math,
three
out
of
five
districts.
it
happens
every
time.
now,
our
submission
would
be
section
2
obviously
doesn't
require
that.
where
the
district
court
went
wrong
is
in
thinking
that
you
don't
have
to
temper
the
gingles
factors
by
a
proportionality
finding,
something
that
the
court
in
gingles
itself
obviously
did.
and
the
reason
that
is,
is
section
2
provides
a
comparative
standard.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
have
the
same
opportunity
as
others.
well,
when
you
create
11
out
of
18
districts
in
dade
county
that
are
majority
hispanic,
you
are
diminishing
the
opportunity
of
white
voters.
that's
exactly
how
you
do
this.
and
therefore,
what
you've
done
is
you've
created
a
far
greater
opportunity
for
hispanic
voters
than
you
would
for
white
voters,
and
that's
not
what
the
statute
requires.
so
i
think
proportionality
is
an
absolute
touchstone,
it
has
to
be.
now,
the
de
grandy
people--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
think
the
statute
forbids
that,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
statute
says
only
that
it
doesn't
require
it.
and,
indeed,
our
argument
is
fully
consistent
with
that.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i'm
saying--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--it's
the
touchstone
as
a
maximum.
that
is
to
say
in
order
to...
i
think
this
court
in
gingles
said
the
following,
and
i
think
this
is
exactly
right,
that
gingles
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
large,
cohesive,
compact...
large,
cohesive,
compact
majority
does
have
a
right
to
proportional
representation.
that's
what
gingles
says
is
the
equal
opportunity.
now,
that
means
not
mandated
proportionality,
as
the
united
states
says.
you've
got
to
show
large,
compact,
and
cohesive.
in
this
case
where
there
was
large,
compact,
and
cohesive,
we
gave
them
proportionality.
whether
less
than
proportionality
would
have
sufficed
under
the
statute
is
an
issue
not
presented
by
this
case,
because
everyone
concedes
in
dade
county
that
there
is
proportionality.
and
our
only
point
is
that
in
order
to
preserve
the
equal
opportunity
language,
you
have
to
accept
proportionality
as
an
upper
limit
in
terms
of
what
the
statute
requires,
whether
the
state--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no,
i
think...
i
think
it
is
under
section
2.
i
think
it's
dispositive.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
and
i
think
that's
true
in
a
single
district
case,
in
contrast--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--you
wouldn't.
but
let
me
say
why
i
think
that's...
why
it
would
be
hard
not
to
accept
the
principle
as
a
general
principle.
if
you
take
a
situation
and
you
say
to
a...
let's
say
this
is
dade
county,
and
you
say
we
have
9
out
of
18
districts
that
are
majority
hispanic,
that's
the
way
we
design
our
plan.
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine...
assuming
that
there's
not
some
other
glitch
like
people
are
prevented
from
getting
to
the
polls,
how
could
that
not
provide
people
in
dade
county
with
an
equal
opportunity
as
other
members
of
the
electorate.
by
hypothesis,
if
hispanics
are
cohesive,
they
will
win
9
out
of
18
districts.
that
is
the
most
that
a
white
majority
could
do.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--it
depends
what
you
mean,
justice
souter.
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
in
a
single
district
plan
it's
very
difficult
to
see,
when
you
have
a
compact
group
and
you
allocate
districts
on
a
proportional
basis,
what
kind
of
steps
in
the
process
might
be
discriminatory.
if
there
are
discriminatory
steps,
then
i
would
concede
you
raise
a
fourteenth
amendment
issue.
but
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--section
2,
it's
absolutely
clear.
indeed,
the
whole
amendment
in
1982
was
that
it
is
effects
that
matter.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
if
you
have
effects
without
intent,
you
lose
under
section
2,
there's
a
violation.
and
if
you
have
intent
without
effects,
there
is
no
violation.
i
think
that's
absolutely
clear
and
that's
what
the
words
of
the
statute
say.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
no,
i
don't--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
concede
that
at
all,
because--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--because
what
you
had
here
was
more
than
proportional.
maximization
is
what
the
district
court
here
did.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
if
that's
what
you
mean
by
maximization,
we're
in
complete
agreement.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
think
what
people
mean
by
maximization,
and
the
lower
courts
have
used
the
term
this
way,
it
is
possible
in
florida
to
create
11
majority
house
districts.
that
is
even
though
hispanics
have
half
the
people
in
dade
county,
you
can
create
11
districts.
that
is
a
simple
numerical
proposition.
and
so
if
you
truly
wanted
to
maximize
minority
representation,
you
could
give
them
a
disproportionate
number
of
districts.
now,
all
we're
saying
is
that's
not
what
section
2
requires.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
where
they're
compact.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
that...
i
think
that's
a
fair
word.
now,
let
me
then
say,
i
think
that...
that,
i
think,
does
dispose
of
the
issues
in
dade
county.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
don't
think
there'd
be
a
section
2
violation,
because
i
don't
think
majorities
have
a
cause
of
action
under
section
2.
i
do
think
it
raises
a
serious
constitutional
question
under
shaw
v.
reno,
a
question
that
i
don't
think
is--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--even
if
they
were
compact,
it
seems
to
me
you
get
into
a
question
of
whether
the
creation
of
a
disproportionate
number
of
minority
districts
is
something
akin
to
affirmative
action.
if
the
voting
rights
act
requires
that
and
if,
under
metromedia,
congress
has
that
power,
i
guess
the
answer
is
yet...
yes.
but,
fortunately,
none
of
that
is
presented--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think...
when
i
say
the
majority,
i
mean
white
people.
i
think
you
have--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
think
that
matters
under
section
2,
justice
stevens.
section
2--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no.
section
2
covers
protected
minorities.
by
that,
it
means
blacks,
hispanic,
asians.
it
does
not
apply
to
whites.
it
doesn't
matter--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--right.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
protected
minorities
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
that
is,
it
gave
a
cause
of
action
here
to
blacks,
to
hispanics...
as
the
court
may
remember,
they
added
what
they
called
language
minorities.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
there's
never
been
a
suggestion...
and,
of
course,
it's
not
presented
by
this
case,
but
there's
never
been
a
suggestion
that
white
voters
would
have
a
cause
of
action
on
section
2.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
which
was
designed
to
implement...
originally,
to
implement
the
fifteenth
amendment--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
talks
about
protected
minorities.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
and
what
i'm
submitting
to
you
is
that
the
term
protected
minorities
really
does
mean
a
discreet
group:
that
is
blacks,
hispanics,
and
so
forth.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
it
probably
would,
but
i
think
that
would
raise
an
equal
protection
question
that
justice
kennedy--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--that
is,
it's
not
a
group
that
is
protected
with
the
term
protected
minority
under
the
statute.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
legislative
history.
and
as
i
say,
the
genesis
of
section
2--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
there
is...
the
term
in
the
statute
is
protected
minority.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well
then
i
misspoke
myself,
then.
then
it
might
well
apply,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
legislative
history
would
make
it...
would
make
it
clear
this
was
designed
to
implement
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
therefore
had
a
specific
purpose.
but
i
guess
it
is
possible,
then,
under
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
it
does
talk
about
members
of
a
class
of
citizens
protected
by
subsection
(a),
and
i
think
the
general
reading
of
that
has
been
that
those
are
minority
citizens
in
the
united
states.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
we
concede
that
hispanics
in
dade
county
are
cohesive
within
dade
county.
we
vigorously
dispute
the
proposition
that
hispanics
in
dade
county
are
cohesive
with
other
hispanics
statewide.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
correct.
that
is,
what
our
submission
is
is
the
failure
of
the
united
states
to
prove
cohesion
statewide
under
its
terms,
means
that
it
hasn't
stated
a
statewide
claim.
it
says
in
order
to
show
a
statewide
claim,
you'd
have
to
prove
cohesion
statewide
and
white-bloc
voting
state-wide.
we
say
it
never
proved
either
of
those
things,
and
a
result
of
that
it
cannot
prove
up
the
very
claim
that
it
is
seeking
to
advance
in
this
litigation.
however,
even
if
it
could
prove
up
both
of
those
points,
it
would
still
fail
because
it
failed
to
prove
the
first
gingles
factor
of
compactness
on
a
statewide
basis.
instead,
what
it
did
was
basically
to
run
directly
to
something
the
statute
disavows,
and
that
is
proportional
representation.
it
said
we
don't
care
where
hispanics
live,
their
vote
is
diluted
unless
they
get
more
districts
in
dade
county
because
they're
entitled
to
statewide
proportionality.
i
think
that
is
so
flatly
inconsistent
with
gingles.
the
united
states
says,
well
gingles
is
just
a
question
of
remedy,
can
you
fit
these
in.
but
that's
not
what
the
opinion
says.
the
opinion
says
that
if
you
don't
show
you're
a
compact
group,
you
have
no
cause
of
action
under
section
2.
indeed,
a
unanimous
court
in
growe
v.
emison
said
failure
to
prove
the
first
gingles
factor
means
no
violation.
and
if
there's
no
violation
there
cannot
be
a
remedy,
we
submit.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
you
can
fit
those
districts
someplace
else
in
the
state.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
let
me
say
it
depends
what
one
means
by
luck-of-the-draw
system.
i
think
what
i
would
say
is
the
following,
is
that
the
hispanics
in
dade
county
are
reasonably
compact,
they
are
cohesive,
and
there's
white-bloc
voting.
therefore
it
seems
to
me,
in
drawing
district
lines
you
have
to
take
into
account
these
communities
of
interest.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
they
were
proven,
we
believe,
in
this
case.
and
we
think
that
they
are
not...
they
are
accurate.
that
is
they
were...
we've
never
disputed
that
those
criteria
are
met.
now,
i
think
a
very
different
question
would
be
done
if
a
state,
for
example,
took
a
computer
and
simply,
truly
drew
circles
on
a
map
as
a
way
of
drawing
lines
and
in
no
way
took
into
account
race.
but
in
practicality,
justice
kennedy,
states
do
take
into
account
community
interests,
including
both
white
and
black
and
religious
and
otherwise,
and
as
long
as
you
are
reasonably
compact,
as
hispanics
in
dade
county
are,
we
think
that's
what
the
voting
rights
contemplates...
act
contemplates,
and
that's
reasonable.
so
we
are
not
unhappy
with
proportionality
as
a
solution
here.
we
think
it's
a
fair
one.
it's
just
when
the
united
states
decides
to
say
that
there
are
another
few
hundred
thousand
hispanics
who
are
dispersed
over
another
12
million
people
in
florida
and
we
have
to
give
them
proportional
representation.
that,
we
think,
can't
be
countenanced.
and
we
think,
finally,
in
that
regard...
let
me
just
make
two
last
points.
one,
it
seems
to
me
the
proof
of
the
pudding
here
is
in
the
bizarre
result
the
united
states
is
forced
to
embrace.
understand,
in
order
to
get
to
11
house
and
4
senate
seats
in
dade
county,
they
have
to
bring
in
voters
all
over...
actually
people
all
over
the
state
of
florida
into
their
case.
and
then
what
do
they
say?
not
that
those
voters
get
a
chance
to
vote
for
anyone.
those
voters
cannot
vote
in
these
minority
districts,
but
people
in
dade
county
who
already
have
a
proportional
group
of
representatives,
they're
going
to
get
extra
people.
and
the
united
states
says,
well,
that's
because
all
these
people
of
the
same
race
have
a
common
interest.
but
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
concept
so
repudiated
by
this
court's
decisions
and
by
the
so-called
proportionality
proviso
in
section
2
itself.
so
i
think
that
is
an
argument
that
really
falls
of
its
own
weight.
the
final
point
i
would
make--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
it
is
within
a
district.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--but
the
assumption
is...
this
is
a
group
right
in
the
following
sense.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
and
the
group...
you've
got
to
have
a
group
of
people.
if
you
are
black
or
you're
hispanic,
you've
got
to
have
a
group
of
people
that
you
say
are
politically
cohesive.
and
if
you
can
show
me
that
you're
going
to
have
50
plus
percent,
basically...
that's
what
gingles
says,
then
you
are
able
to,
quote,
elect
representatives
of
your
choice.
the
particular
individual
in
the
district,
the
black
individual
may
vote
completely
contrary
to.
but
what
cohesion
says
and
what
compactness
says
is
that
you're
going
to
be
able,
as
a
group,
to
elect
it.
now,
looking
at--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--they're
a
different
group.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
they're
a
different
group,
entirely
different
group.
and
their
group
gets
a
representative
in
dade
county.
now
the
last--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
think
you've
ever
said
that
in
equal
protection
cases.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
think
that
is
not
the
premise
of
the
current
voting
rights
act.
i
think
the
current
voting
rights
act
does
talk
in
terms
of
the
ability
to
elect
people
of
your
choice.
and
if
it
says
that,
that
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
have
a
group,
because
one
voter
simply
cannot
elect
people
of
his
or
her
choice.
and
so
i
think
the
necessarily
consequence...
necessary
consequence
of
the
voting
act
is
that
it
is
a
group
right.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
has
to
be
reconciled
in
the
following
sense.
i
think
that
congress...
obviously
this
court
in
the
bolden
case
had
reconciled
it
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
congress
went
beyond
that
when
it
amended
the
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
at
least
the
decision--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
agree
with
that,
and
that's
what
i
think
the
principle
of
the
shaw
decision
was
last
term.
that
is,
i
think
there
is
a
point
where
congress'
ability
to
fashion
group
rights
may
run
into
an
equal
protection
problem.
but
i
don't
think
any
of
that's
presented
here.
the
last
point,
if
i
might,
is
even
if
we
were
to
assume
the
test
of
statewide
proportionality
here,
there's
absolutely
no
question
that
florida's
plan
provides
statewide
proportionality
to
hispanics
on
the
basis
of
citizenship.
that
is
to
say
that
there
are...
approximately
7.15
percent
of
the
state
are
citizens,
are
hispanics.
that's
not
just
in
dade,
but
statewide.
and
the
number
of
seats
in
the
house
and
senate
exceeds
7.15
percent.
and
there's
no
question
here
what
the
voting
rights
act
covers.
it
covers
the
rights
of
citizens,
not
the
rights
of
people,
not
the
rights
of
people
of
a
certain
age,
but
the
rights
of
citizens.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
a
correct...
i
think
that's
what
they
argue,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
think
they're
right
about
that.
i
think
this
court
has
said
for
one
person,
one
vote
allocations
you
can
use
population,
and
florida
did
that
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem.
now,
the
question
in
this
case
is
do
hispanic
citizens
in
florida...
because
they're
now
making
a
statewide
claim,
they're
no
longer
making
a
district
claim...
do
they
have
less
opportunity
than
other
members
of
the
electorate
to
elect
representatives
of
their
choice?
now,
what
i
submit
is
if
you
have
7
plus
percent
of
the
electorate,
of
the
citizens,
and
you've
got
7
plus
percent
of
the
seats,
then
you
have
exactly
the
same
opportunity.
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
you
district,
because
we're
now
making
a
statewide
claim.
and
so
under
any
view
of
the
facts,
we
submit
that
this
case
should
render
a
finding
of
no
liability
with
respect
to
either
the
senate
or
the
house
plan,
and
that
the
judgment
with
respect
to
the
senate
plan
of
no
violation
was
correct,
and
with
respect
to
the
house
plan
should
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
would
ask
the
court...
with
indulgence,
i
want
to
refer
to
the
appendix,
the
joint...
jurisdictional
appendix
on
92,
5/19,
the
jsf,
to
the
district
court's
opinion,
because
i
think
that
we
need
to
have
a
couple
of
points
of
grounding
here.
the
lawyer
for
the
de
grandy
people
just
made
an
argument
about
natural
communities
and
compact
districts.
on
the
bottom
of
43a,
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
i'd
like
to
read
the
court.
the
court
says:
"this
court
does
not
find
that
the
districts
drawn
by
the
de
grandy
plaintiffs
are
significantly
less
geographically
compact
than
those
districts
by
the
state
of
florida.
"
all
right.
so
to
begin
with,
so
we
have
a
baseline,
the
district
court
has
said
that
their
map,
which
counsel
didn't
include
in
his
handout...
their
map
is
not
more
compact,
it's
less
compact,
less
natural.
you
were
shown
a
district,
102.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
they
say
they
are
not
significantly
less
geographically
compact.
i
take
it
it
means
they
are
less
compact,
just
not
significantly
so,
right?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
but
at
a
minimum--
[laughter]
but
at
a
minimum,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
notion
that
somehow
we
did
all
these
unnatural
things...
their
plan
draw
districts,
again,
that
were,
in
the
court's
words,
at
least
as
noncompact.
second
of
all,
you
were
shown
a
district,
102,
on
the
house
plan,
and
you
were
told
all
sorts
of
representations
about
this
district.
let
me
tell
you
the
facts.
the
district
goes
across
the
everglades
of
florida.
it's
largely
nonpopulated
in
collier
county.
in
fact
the
numbers
are
that
78
percent
of
that
district
is
from
dade
county.
it's
largely
hispanic.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
of
the
population,
yes.
78
percent.
the
reason
it
goes
across
the
everglades
and
picks
up
a
group
in
collier
county
is
collier
county
is
a
section
5
county
and
we
had
to
preclear
that
county
with
the
department
of
justice.
we
picked
up
a
group
of
hispanics
in
that
county,
a
small
group,
so
that
they
would
be
in
a
majority
district.
now
to
move
to
the
more
important
things.
the
question
is
was
this
a
statewide
case
or
was
this
is
a
dade
county
case?
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
question
because
i
think
there
was
a
lot
of
confusion
generated.
i
would
start
with
page
30a
of
the
appendix,
the
jsf,
the
district
court's
opinion.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
key
statement
made
by
the
district
court
with
respect
to
the
senate
plan...
this
is
right
before
it
becomes
application
of
the
gingles
factors.
it
says
with
respect
to
the
senate,
plan,
hispanic
and
african-american
vote
dilution
exists
in
dade
county.
in
dade
county.
additionally,
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
hispanic
vote
dilution
exists
in
dade
county
under
the
house
plan.
that's
what
the
district
court
found.
now,
the
united
states
says
you've
got
to
look
at
lots
of
records.
the
united
states
put
evidence
on
in
this
case.
what
did
it
put
evidence
on?
it
put
evidence
on
about
dade
county
only.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
the
district
court
in
this
opinion...
if
you
look
at
its
findings
on
the
three
gingles
factors,
just
read
them
one
at
a
time.
geographic
compactness,
cohesion,
and
white-bloc
voting,
and
i
represent
to
the
court
each
and
every
one
of
those
findings
unmistakably
is
in
dade
county.
indeed,
on
73a
in
the
concurring
opinion...
just
because
it's
more
compact
here...
the
court
flatly
says
in
paragraph
2:
"for
dade
county,
the
second
and
third
parts
of
the
test.
"
referring
to
gingles,
"are
established".
the
de
grandy
people
say
in
their
brief
that
they
said
on
the
record,
we
are
presenting
evidence
of
vote
dilution,
quote,
only
as
to
dade
county.
and
the
district
court's
opinion--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
did
not.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
it's
referring
to
dade
county
as
a
geographical
entity,
and
let
me
explain
why,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
hispanic
group
of
plaintiffs
is
concentrated
in
dade
county.
they
do
not
spill
over
in
any
numbers
into
other
counties,
that
is
like
broward
which
is
north.
of
the
house
districts
there
are
5
out
of
7
solidly
in
dade
county,
one
that
starts
in
the
south
of
dade
and
the
only
southern
county
beneath
it,
and
one
that
goes
in
the
north,
that's
in
the
senate.
in
the
house,
there
are
17
districts
in
dade
county,
one
largely
in
dade
county,
and
2
that
touch
a
piece.
this
was
a
dade
county
case.
that's
what
the
evidence
showed.
and
i
think
the
notion
that
this
was
a
statewide
dilution
claim
is
really
wholly
insupportable.
and
let
me
give
a
few
additional
facts.
when--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--there
were
proceedings
in
the
congress.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
think
the
only
finding,
so
to
speak...
the
quote
that
you're
getting
is
racial
polarization
existed
to
varying
degrees.
that
is
the
only
thing
lifted
from
any
other
proceeding,
in
a
context
of
a
district
court
drawing
a
statewide
congressional
plan,
justice
o'connor.
now,
that
statement,
on
its
face,
does
not
support
hispanic
cohesion.
let
me
tell
you
why.
you
can
have
hispanics
in
north
florida
who
are
democrats
who
get
outvoted
by
republican
whites.
that
might
show
cohesion
and
bloc
vote,
polarized
voting,
but
that
doesn't
show
anything
about
hispanics
in
north
florida
and
hispanics
in
dade
county.
we
know
one
undisputed
fact
which
the
united
states
concedes
in
its
brief.
outside
of
dade
county
there's
one
other
house
member
in
the
state
of
florida
who's
hispanic.
he
was
elected
in
hillsborough
county,
the
tampa
area,
all
right.
that
person
is
a
democrat.
there
are...
all
the
other
hispanics,
from
dade
county,
are
republicans.
that
person
was
elected
with
strong
hispanic
support.
so
the
idea...
the
only
other
city
in
the
whole
state
where
there's
a
large
bloc
of
hispanics
of
any
number,
they
vote
for
a
democrat,
and
in
south
florida,
in
dade
county,
they
all
vote
republican.
the
idea
that
there's
cohesion
is
simply
untenable.
if
you
want...
and
i
agree
with
the
court,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
beyond
the
opinion--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--yes.
the
record
shows
where...
that
is
there
are
data
in
the
record
that
in
hillsborough
county,
in
tampa,
a
hispanic
was
elected
in
a
district
that
is
a
hispanic-influence
district
and
it's
a
democratic
hispanic.
that
is
undisputed
in
this
case.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
if
anything,
suggests
that
far
from
cohesion
there's
noncohesion.
the
de
grandy
experts,
justice
stevens,
said...
and
they
don't
dispute
this...
they
said
hispanics
in
south
florida
are
different
from
hispanics
everywhere
else,
including
in
the
rest
of
florida.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
they
have
different
ethnic
backgrounds.
but
principally
for
our
purposes,
they're
not
politically
cohesive.
one
group
votes
democrat...
and,
indeed,
this
goes
to
the
polarized
voting
point
you
discussed...
they
join
together
with
blacks
in
north
florida
to
vote
for
democrats.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
but
if
you
say
one
group,
if
there's
noncohesion
between
those
two
groups--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--if
they...
i
think
they
could
make
a
subgroup
claim.
if
they
could
show
that
their
subgroup,
that
is,
let's
say,
hispanics
who
are
from
puerto
rico
and
not
from
cuba...
yes,
i
think
they
could
make
that
claim
out
under
this
statute.
so
i
think,
in
fairness,
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
on
this.
and
a
single
line
that
says
there's
racially
polarized
voting
when
you're
dealing
with
three
different
racial
groups,
is
not
evidence.
and
if
the
united
states
thought
this
was
all
done,
they
wouldn't
have
put
on
their
case
in
this
case.
they
put
on
evidence
about
racial
polarization
in
florida.
the
district
court
understood
that.
that's
this
case.
two
other
factors,
if
i
might.
even
if
you
prove
cohesion,
there
is
simply
no
showing
of
compactness.
and
i
think
the
united
states
seriously
misreads
gingles.
let
me
explain
why.
gingles
says
you
have
to
show
compactness,
not
for
a
remedy
but
for
liability,
and
there's
a
reason
for
that.
section
2
only
applies
to
state
procedures,
standards,
and
so
forth
that
dilute
votes.
there's
no
automatic
cure
for
vote
dilution.
you've
got
to
show
something
that
the
state
did.
now,
what
is
the
state...
what
is
the
allegation
here
that's
in
play?
that
is
the
state
drew
lines
on
a
map
and
diluted
votes.
now,
if
you're
not
compact,
the
state
lines
don't
dilute
your
votes.
that's
the
geography.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
i
did.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i...
they'd
have
to
show
a
geographically
compact
group,
absolutely.
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--they
have
to
show
that
the
black
voters
in
a
single
district,
justice
stevens,
would
make
up
a
majority.
now,
in
fact,
the
question
that
came
up
is
if
you
assumed
20
percent
blacks
in
that
group
and
you
have
five
seats,
then
if
you
had
12
percent
of
the
blacks
in
a
compact
group
they
could
constitute
a
majority
in
one
of
five.
but
there's
no
question
in--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--absolutely.
because
you
cannot...
the
state's
drawing
compact
single
district
lines.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
says
in
gingles
itself.
in
drawing
a
line...
let's
just
think
of
the
map
as
we
draw
it.
here
you
have
a
group.
let's
say
you
have
5
percent
of
blacks
who
live
in
one
part
of
this
large
county,
and
the
other
15
percent
are
dispersed.
you
cannot
draw
a
single-district
map
that
would
give
them
a
majority.
it
can't
be
done.
you've
got
to
give
them
a
gerrymander
of
extreme
proportion.
if
that's
true,
the
question
is
under
section
2,
what
is
the
state
procedure
or
standard
that's
diluting
their
vote?
and
the
court
in
gingles
says
there
is
none
because
the
lines
can't
do
it.
so
i
submit
to
you
at
a
minimum...
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
called
the
precondition...
if
a
group
of
minorities,
of
any
group
of
minorities,
if
that
group
cannot
make
up
a
majority
within
a
compact
single
district,
they
have
no
vote
dilution
claim.
their
vote,
if
it's
diluted
so
to
speak,
is
diluted
not
by
the
state
but
by
geography,
and
section
2
doesn't
address
it.
the
last
point
i'd
make
before
i
sit
down
is
you
notice
nobody
mentioned
the
issue
of
citizenship.
and
the
reason
is
whatever
else
is
said,
there
is
statewide
proportionality
on
the
basis
of
citizenship.
and
the
statute,
clear
as
it
can
be,
refers
to
citizens,
not
to
population.
we
submit,
thank
you.
