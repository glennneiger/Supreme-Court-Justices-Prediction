just
on
the
maximization
point,
if
a
state
chose
voluntarily
to
maximize
in
this
instance,
would
there
be
a
constitutional
or
a
section
2
violation,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
districts
were
compact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--on
this
record,
do
you...
can
you
say
that
florida
did
have
the
obligation
to
structure
districts
with
proportional
representation
in
dade
county
itself,
or
could
they
have
had
a
luck-of-the-draw
system?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
those
premises
an
assumption
that
the
state
has
simply
accepted
in
this
case,
or
were
they
proven?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
have
we
said
in
our
cases
that
the
equal
protection
clause
grants
group
rights?
we've
never
said
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
the
whole
underpinning,
the
whole
premise,
the
whole
principle
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
that
people
are
treated
as
individuals.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
are
providing
a
remedy
to
persons
who
have
not
been
wronged.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
feldman,
assume
there
were
no
gingles
preconditions
show,
could
a
state,
on
its
own
initiative,
maximize
the
voting
strength
of
racial
minorities
within
its
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maximizing
as
you
use
it
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
taking
a
state...
taking
a
state-wide
sample
of
all
the
minorities
and
giving
them
the
maximum
possible
number
of
seats
in,
say,
the
state
legislature.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i'm
assuming
that
gingles...
that
the
gingles
conditions,
preconditions
cannot
be
found.
what
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no
bloc
voting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
raises
at
least
at
least
a
delicate
constitutional
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't
that
mean
it's
all
the
more
important
for
us
to
be
quite
confident
that
the
district
court's
judgment
was
no
more
than
necessary
to
remedy
the
violations
that
were
shown?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
it
seems
to
me
an
odd
result
to
give
a
remedy
to
someone
who
has
not
suffered
a
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
that
you
used
those
same
factors
and
you
got
15,
would
you
be
entitled
to
that
remedy?
