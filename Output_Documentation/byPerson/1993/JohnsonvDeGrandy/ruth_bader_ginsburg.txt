ruth
bader

mr.
klein,
i
assume
that
you
are
asking
us
to
reject
this
notion
of
the
statewide
frame
of
reference
totally,
for
this
case
and
for
every
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean
nationwide
protected
minorities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
your
view
that
the
cohesiveness
of
the
groups...
there
was
some
issue
about
that
in
this
case,
that
that's
irrelevant
to
your
analysis.
the
question
of...
is
are
we
talking
about
a
protected
group,
are
the
hispanics
in
dade
county
and
in
other
parts
of
the
state
cohesive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
your...
the
view
you
stated
earlier
about
it's
not
a
compact
group,
then
the
lack
of
cohesiveness,
the
lack
of
identity,
of
necessary
identity
of
interest
is
kind
of
surplusage.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
feldman,
isn't
that
the
line
you
drew
in
your
complaint?
didn't
the
united
states'
complaint
speak
in
terms
of
the
20
district
dade
county
area?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
was
this
state
frame
of
reference
stated
in
the
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
proof
of
that
other
than...
you
state
in
your
brief,
for
example,
english
language
initiatives,
language-based
employment
discrimination.
if
one
were
to
make
a
list
of
cohesiveness
or
lack
of
cohesiveness,
one
would
have
a
pretty
fair
number
of
entries
on
the
other
side
as
well,
would
not
that
be
so
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
other...
what
other
than
the
two
examples
that
you
put
in
your
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
evidence
that
there
is
a
greater
identity
between
the
hispanics
in
other
parts
outside
dade
county
and
african-americans
than
with
hispanics
in
dade
county,
that
the
identity
of
those
two
groups...
so
if
you
were
going
to
pick
a
group
to
bracket
the
hispanics
outside
dade
county,
it
would
not
be
the
hispanics
inside
dade
county,
but
you
would
find
more
cohesiveness
with
african-americans
inside
dade
county?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
it
mean
to
vote
cohesively?
does
it
mean,
for
example,
to
vote
for
one
party
rather
than
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
do
you
extract
from
this
opinion
an
indication
that
it's
proper
on
your
statewide
frame
to
bracket
the
hispanics
outside
dade
county
with
the
hispanics
inside,
rather
than
with
african-americans.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
certainly
a
delphic
way
of
putting
it,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
delphic,
isn't
it,
to
get
all
that
out
of
racially
polarized
voting,
which
could
mean
hispanics
and
african-americans
versus
whites?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that
doesn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--deal
with
the
question
that
i
asked
you.
because
in
one
part
of
this
case,
the
senate
part,
wasn't
there
a
question
if
there's
only
room
for
one
more,
who
should
get
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
talking
about
creating
two
more
districts
and
if
the
cohesiveness
is
closer
between
african-americans
and
hispanics
outside
dade
county,
then
why
should
those
two
districts
go
to
hispanics
in
dade
county?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
support
in
the
case
law
for
this
statewide
frame
of
reference
as
opposed
to
the
geographical
districts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
involve
any
disrespect
to
the
lines
that
existed
before
for
other
groups?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words
if
you
said...
respect
everyone
equally
and
hispanic
groups
were
not
respected
equally,
do
the
new
lines
disrespect
any
other
groups?
