mr.

allotted
might
be
a
better
word
than
maximized,
it
seems
to
me,
in
that
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
the
government
argues...
or
perhaps
it's
the
appellee
who
argues
in
response
to
that
that
florida
has
chosen
to
draw
its
districts
in
terms
of
total
population
rather
than
people
of
voting
age,
citizens,
and
so
it
can't
complain
if
the
voting
rights
act
case
is
fought
out
along
those
lines.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
klein.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
the
district
court
make
a
finding
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
it
also...
didn't
it
also
point
out
just
what
justice
ginsburg
said,
that
the
cuban
hispanics
in
dade
county
tend
to
vote
quite
different
from
non-cuban
hispanics?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
provision
of
the
statute
is
it
that
refers
to
people
of
spanish
heritage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
something
in
1973?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
feldman,
on
page
40a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
where
you
get
to
part
b
of
the
court's
opinion,
that
first
sentence
is
the
plaintiffs...
that
the
dade
county's...
"the
dade
county's
hispanic
population
is
sufficiently
large
and
geographically
compact
to
constitute
a
majority
in
4
senate
and
11
house
districts.
"
that
sounds
to
me
as
if
they
were
thinking
in
terms
of
dade
county
and
not
of
the
state
at
large.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
very
difficult
to
contend
otherwise,
at
least
with
respect
to
that
particular
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
told
by
the
appellants
that
the
case
was
tried,
basically,
on
the
basis
of
dade
county.
you're
telling
us
no,
it
wasn't,
it
was
state
wide.
we
weren't
there.
we
have
to
look
at
places
like
this
to
try
to
make
a
judgment
between
the
two
of
you.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
statement
like
this
in
the
opinion
does
cut
against
your
point
of
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
why
should
that
be?
it
seems
to
me
the
plaintiffs
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
their
case
at
trial
and
if
they
fail,
if
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
decree
that
they
wanted,
you
don't
send
it
back
and
say,
well,
let
them
try
again.
you
say
they
had
their
chance,
the
judgment
is
reversed,
and
judgment
is
entered
for
the
defendants.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
saying
there
was...
at
worse,
from
your
point
of
view,
there
was
a
failure
of
the
district
court
to
find
on
a
crucial
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
foster,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
kind
of
purplish
blue
or
the
cobalt
blue?
[laughter]
there
are
two
different--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
foster.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wherein
was
the
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
the
law
passed
by
the
florida
legislature?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
and
you
say
nine
districts
was
not
enough.
in
dade
county
or
statewide?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
what
they
said,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
they
were
talking
about
districts
which
included
some
part
of
dade
county.
i
don't
think
they
insisted
that
it
was
limited
to
dade
county.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
it
doesn't
include
any
part
of
dade
county.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
areawise
or
population?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
who
were
these
exhibits
introduced
by?
were
these
your
exhibits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
you
have
one
dealing
with
the
miami
area,
one
dealing
with
what
you
call
south
florida,
another
dealing
with
what
you
call
south
florida.
i
take
it
your
exhibits
didn't
go
beyond
at
least
south
florida.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
foster.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klein,
you
have
18
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't...
if
you're
depending
on
the
sentence
you
just
read
for
the
conclusion
that
they're
less
compact,
i
don't
think
that
sentence
supports
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
reading
it
very
favorably.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
78
percent
of
the
population.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klein,
do
you
have...
did
you
participate
in
the
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
idea
when
the
reference
is
made
to
dade
county,
as
in
that
sentence
you
just
quoted
or
some
other,
is
that
referring
to
the
dade
county
in
the
sense
of
all
districts
which
touched
on
dade
county
or
is
it
referring
to
dade
county
as
a
geographical
entity
regardless
of
what
districts
might
extend
both
in
and
out
of
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klein.
the
case
is
submitted.
