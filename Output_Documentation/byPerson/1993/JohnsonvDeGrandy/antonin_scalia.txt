justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
curious
in
a
statute
that
absolutely
forbids
that.
do
you
find
any
irony
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it's
the
touchstone.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
it
be
the
touchstone
if
it
doesn't
require
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
really
disagree,
as
i
understand
it,
with
the
maximization
argument
made
by
the
government.
your...
you
concede
maximization,
don't
you?
you
just
say
the
maximization
only
has
to
occur
within
the...
within
the
district
where
there
is
a
cohesive
racial
group.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
that
district
has
to
be
maximized.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
proportional
representation?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
maximization
certainly
doesn't
mean...
doesn't
mean
that
they're
going
to
win
if
they
have
1
vote
against
100.
it
simply
means
that
on
a
one
person,
one
vote
basis,
they
will
have
the
number
of
representatives
that
is
the
same
percentage
of
the
representatives
as
their
votes
are
of
the
total
votes.
that's
all
maximization
is.
it
doesn't
mean
they
have
to
get
all
the
representatives,
certainly.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
does
anybody
else
mean
by
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see,
okay.
but
you
agree
that
it
has
to
be
maximized
up
to
the
point
where
they
can
elect
as
many
representatives
as
they
are
numerically
of
the...
racially
of
the
population
of
the
state
or
of
the
subunit
that
has
a
cohesive
group.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure...
but
isn't
that
the
same
principle
that
you're
accepting
within
a
district?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
the
vote
of
no
individual
black
person
or
other
minority
person
is
increased
at
all,
but
that
person
is
benefitted
only
that
the
votes
of
others,
not
necessarily
himself,
is
augmented.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
may
choose
to
vote
for...
you
know,
for
not
the
black
candidate
but
a
white
candidate.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
group
right,
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
this
is
the
wrong
group.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
an
individual
right,
you're
saying.
it's
a
different
group
that
they
belong
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
square
that
with
the
compact
and
cohesiveness
requirement
of
gingles?
justice
antonin
scalia
see,
but
once
you
have
some
compact
group
that
can
sort
of
carry
the
banner
for
the
minority
statewide,
you
can
give
that
compact
group
as
many
votes
as
is
necessary
to
represent
the
minority
statewide
is
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
must
want
to
elect
hispanics.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
enough
if
all...
say
all
hispanics
vote
republican
or,
you
know,
all
of
some
minority...
some
other
minority
votes
democratic
all
the
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
enough.
they
have
to
vote
for
a
member
of
their
race,
that's
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
enough
if
they
always
vote
for
one
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
what
is
it?
if
that's
not
enough,
they
have
to
vote...
want
to
vote
for
a
person
of
their
race,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
hispanics
were
not
protected.
but
what
was
the
group
that
is
protected?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
where
does
that
statute
say
which
people
are
entitled
to
equal
voting
opportunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
opposed
to
everybody,
just
certain
groups,
where
it
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
enough
if...
i
mean
are
we
supposed
to
go
through
the
testimony
to
see
if
it
was
made
out?
doesn't
gingles
require
that
there
be
a
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
talking
about
findings,
not
just
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
i
had
thought
that
the
whole
name
of
the
game
in
trying
to
maximize
the
racial
vote
is
not
to
keep
neighborhoods
together,
but
to
keep
only
so
many
of
them
together
as
will
give
you
51
percent
of
the
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
put
another
51...
or,
you
know,
to
make
it
safe,
60
percent.
you
don't
want
a
100
percent
hispanic
district.
that
will
not
maximize
the
hispanic
vote.
so
i
don't
know
how
these
criteria
you've
been
talking
about
has
anything
to
do
with
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
intentionally
go
about
packing
districts
on
the
basis
not
of
neighborhood
lines.
you
have
to
be
very
careful
to
include
a
fair
number
of
anglos
in
the
district.
