mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
about
the
dade
county
council,
but
about
the
florida
legislature.
it
will
always
be
the
case
that
when
you're
measuring
whether
a
group
is
under
or
over
represented
within
a
larger
jurisdiction,
there
will
be
some
parts
of
the
jurisdiction
where
the
minority
group
is
under
represented
and
other
parts
of
the
jurisdiction
where
it's
over
represented.
the
whole
point
of
looking
at
this
to
determine
whether
the
minority
group
has
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate
and
elect,
is
to
determine
when
you
look
at
those
electoral
opportunities
divided
up
over
the
jurisdiction
as
a
whole,
of
whether
it's
equal.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
actually
don't
think
there's
any
problem
in
squaring
that
with
those
requirements.
the
compactness
requirement
in
gingles,
the
court
was
quite
explicit
in
stating
why
that
requirement
was
necessary,
and
that
was
to
show
that
there
is
some
area
of
the
jurisdiction
where
the
minority
group
is
sufficiently
compact
that
it
could
form
a
district
if
the
state
wanted
to
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
that...
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
within
gingles
itself
there
was
no
evidence
at
all...
or
in
any
of
the
cases
that
have
come
up
since
gingles...
concerning
how
minorities
were
distributed
throughout
whatever
jurisdiction
it
was.
there
may
have
been
a
minority
in
one
of
the
districts
in
gingles
who
was
all
the
way
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
jurisdiction
at
issue
there,
but
that
fact
really
had
no
bearing.
the
point
of
the
first
gingles
requirement
is
could
you
draw
a
district
or
are
the
problems
that
are
caused...
vote
dilution
here,
are
they
caused
by
just
the
residential
dispersion.
could
i...
i
would
like
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
may
illustrate
it.
if
you
look
at
south
florida
there
are
20
districts
in
the
house
that
border...
that
touch
on
dade
county
and
that
together
comprise
all
of
dade
county
and
a
few
surrounding
areas.
if
you
just
move
up
the
florida
coast
one
more
county
to
broward
county,
or
even...
the
effect
is
stronger
if
you
move
up
two
counties
to
palm
beach
county.
in
that
case
you
have
all
of
south
florida,
and
if
you
were
to
look
at
that
area,
for
instance,
the
minority
hispanics
would
be
substantially
under
represented,
in
fact
more
so
than
we...
than
the
two
seats
that
we're
talking
about
here.
there's
no
way
to
arbitrarily
divide...
to
draw...
there's
no
reason
to
take
a
single
line
of
those
18
districts
which
themselves
don't
respect...
i'm
sorry
20
districts
which
themselves
don't
respect
county
lines
in
the
first
place.
there's
no
reason
to
take
that
line
and
say
well
we
can
only
look
at
the
vote
dilution
that
has
occurred
within
that
area.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
you
do
have
to
look
at
that
area
for
purposes...
and
particularly
you
have
to
look
at
particular
parts
of
that
area
to
see
that
the
way
that
the
state
drew
the
lines
there
to
fragment
and
impact
the
hispanic
population,
to...
which
had
the
effect
of
giving
them
less
seats
than
they
would
have
gotten.
that
is
the
area...
just
as
in
any
gingles
case
there
will
be
one
area
where
you
can
draw
the
lines
where
the
minority...
that
would
give
the
minority...
that
you
can
show
the
minority
group
could
have
been
given
that
district.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the...
i
think
the
ultimate
allegation
was
that
hispanics
in
the
state
of
florida
are
denied
equal
opportunity
to
participate
and
elect
candidates
of
their
choice.
the
complaint
also
said
that
hispanics
in
the
state
of
florida
are
cohesive.
it
said
that
hispanics
in
the
state
of
florida
have
suffered--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
record
of
this
case
as
it
comes
to
this
court.
there
really...
there
were...
this
was
not
all
that
happened
in
the
case
was
in
8
days
of,
or
5
days
or
whatever
it
was
of
trial
here.
there
had
previously
been
a
congressional
phase
of
the
case.
the
same
district
court
sat
on
the
congressional
phase
of
the
case
and
made
detailed
findings
about
the
state
of
florida
in
an
opinion
that's
in
the
joint...
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
in
every...
i
guess
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
in
the
congress...
it
was
already
decided
before
the
trial
started
here.
the
court
had
already
decided
that
there
was
racially
polarized
voting,
one
segment
of
which
is
that
the
hispanics
were
cohesive.
there
were
extensive
studies
of
elections
throughout
the
state
of
florida
that
was
the
primary
basis
for
that
conclusion.
i
mean,
i
could
give
you
some
examples.
first
of
all,
there
was
the
court's
opinion,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
there
was
a
special
master
who
was
appointed
to
take
evidence
in
that
case
at
joint
appendix
61.
he
comes
to
the
same
conclusion.
there
was
an
independent
expert
who
was
appointed
to
develop
a
plan
in
that
case.
at
101
to
103
of
the
joint
appendix
he
says:
"it
is
beyond
dispute
that
there's
racially
polarized
voting
whereby
african-americans
or
hispanics
vote
one
way
and
whites
or
anglos
vote
another.
"
and
he's
talking
about
the
state
of
florida.
there
were--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
there
was
some
anecdotal
evidence
that
there
were
various
segments
of
the
hispanic
community,
that
it
does
not
vote
cohesively
with
the
community
as
a
whole.
it
is...
the
statute
does
protect
hispanics...
i
think
persons
of
spanish
descent
is
the
way
the
statute--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
district
court
finding
was
that
there
is
racially
polarized
voting
in
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
believe
the
district
court
did
make
that
finding.
it
did
refer
at
one
point...
it
referred
to
the
testimony
of,
actually,
one
of
the
plaintiffs'
experts,
that
hispanics
in
dade
county
have
somewhat
different
voting
patterns
in
terms
of
party
affiliation
than
hispanics
in
the
rest
of
the
country.
i
don't
take
that
to
read
the
rest
of
florida,
especially
in
light
of
the
consistent
findings
that
hispanics
vote
cohesively
in
the
state
of
florida.
in
addition,
the
court
looked
at
all
of
these
various
subgroups
of
hispanics.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
mean
i
think
that
might
be
a
factor.
but
the
way
it's
commonly
proven
is
you
look
at
studies
of
how
people...
of
how
groups
vote.
and
what
was
found
in
florida
is
that
very
consistently
hispanics
want
to
elect
hispanics
as
candidates,
throughout
the
state,
and
they
do,
and
the
only
time
when
they
have
the
opportunity
to
do
that
is
when
they're
in
the
majority
district.
in
addition,
there
are
statewide
elections,
and
you
can
look
and
see
how
the
hispanics
in
the
state
as
a
whole
vote
on
those
elections.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
they
don't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
required,
but
i
think
that
that
may
be
proven
in
a
given
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think,
yeah.
i
don't
know
if...
i
don't
know
if
just
showing
a
party
affiliation
would
necessarily
prove
anything.
it
may
be
that
people
in
different--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
that
that's
it.
i
think,
as
this
court...
this
court
in
gingles
said
that
it
was
the
candidate...
it
was
the
race
of
the
elector,
not
the
race
of
the
candidate
that's
what
you
look
at
here.
i
think
it...
looks
and
sees
whether
they
tend
to
vote
for
the
same
people.
if
they
tend
to
vote
for
the
same
people,
you
say
that
they
vote
cohesively.
if
not,
then
not.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
i
believe
the
statutory
language
says
persons
of
spanish
descent.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
everybody's
entitled
to
equal
voting
opportunity,
but
there
are
particular...
the
statute
protects
against
unequal
voting
opportunities
on
account
of
race,
for
example,
and
that
would
affect
everybody.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
also
specifically
uses
the
term
persons
protected
by...
let
me
just
see,
it
says
by...
"in
contravention
of
the
guarantees
set
forth
in.
"
--this
is
in
section
2(a)...
it
says
"of
the
guarantees
set
forth
in
section
1973b(f)(2)
of
this
title.
"
and
that
provision
has
to
do
with
language
minorities,
and
i
believe--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--for
purposes
of
this
section
the
term
language
minorities
means
a
number
of
different
groups
including--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--or
persons
of
spanish
heritage.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
the...
it's
the
fact...
i
mean,
technically,
it
is
that
they
are
of
spanish
heritage,
that's
the
statutory
term.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
but
that...
it
is
clear
that
what
congress
had...
that
term
is
used
in
the
context
of
a
provision...
a
different
provision
of
the
statute
that
talks
about
the
rights
of
language
minorities
and
the
problems
that
have
been
caused
by
discrimination
against
people
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
they
speak
a
different
language.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's...
42
u.s.c.
1973
aa-1a(e).
i'm
sorry
it's
such
a
complex...
and,
actually,
the
term
is
also,
for
instance,
in
the
1973
1(c)(3),
and
i
think
it's
probably
in
a
couple
of
other
provisions
as
well.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
because
section
2
protects
not
only
for
discrimination
or
unequal
electoral
opportunities
on
the
base
of
race
or
color,
but
also
in
this
provision...
where
it
adds.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
and
that,
in
essence,
as
language
of
minorities.
but
in
any
event,
the
evidence
at...
the
evidence
at
the
congressional
hearing,
and,
in
fact,
some
of
the
evidence
from
the
state's
own
expert
at
the
legislative...
at
this,
at
the
hearing
that
was
held
immediately
before
the
judgment
in
this
case,
clearly
showed...
i
mean
everyone
agreed
that
hispanics
vote
cohesively
in
the
state
of
florida,
given
all
of
this
voluminous
data.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
district
court...
i
think
what
the
district
court,
having
made
the
number
of
findings...
it
did
in
this
very
case.
i
mean
the
record
in
the
congressional
case
is
in
this
court.
it
was
from
the
same
complaints
and
it
is
the
same
case
and
the
same
parties.
in
that
case,
i
think
they
made
all...
they
made...
they
had
made
a
wide
variety
of
findings
about
elections
and
voters
in
the
state
of
florida.
when
they
started
the
hearing
in
the
legislative
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact
judge
hatchett
said:
"this
court
has
made
findings
regarding
elections
in
the
state
of
florida.
"
this
is
volume
1
of
the
transcript,
page
82.
"now
we
talk
about
whether
we're
talking
about
a
different
state
and
different
voters,
but
the
voters
we're
talking
about
are
the
same
ones
and
we
made
very
detailed
findings
regarding
those
voters
in
elections.
"
having
done
that,
what
the
court
concentrated
on,
i
think,
in
this
case
was
the
question
of
whether
you
really...
they
had
made
most
of
the
necessary
findings...
of
whether
there
was
any
reason
to
alter
those
findings.
or,
in
particular,
whether
the
plaintiffs
could
show
that
you
really
could
draw
additional
districts
in
dade
county,
as
they
had
alleged
in
their
complaint.
that
there
was
a
lot...
most
of...
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
most
of
the
evidence
at
trial
centered
around
the
issue
of
whether
those
additional
districts
would
be
compact,
whether
hispanics
in
dade
county
were
cohesive.
because
if
they
weren't
cohesive,
the
hispanic
districts
wouldn't...
they
wouldn't
be
able,
if
they
formed
their
own
districts,
to
elect
the
candidates
of
their
choice.
and
whether
they
would...
those
districts
would
have
hispanic
majorities,
that
was
what
most
of
the
trial
was
about.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
i
think
it
may
be
inartfully
drawn.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
what
they
meant
in
that
sentence
was
that
the
vote
dilution
that
had
occurred...
i
mean,
what
you
had
was
a
practice
where
hispanics
could
only
elect
other
hispanics...
or
could
only
elect
candidates
of
their
choice
where
they
were
the
majority...
where
they
were
in
the
majority
in
a
district.
and
that
the
state
had
deliberately
drawn
lines
to
fragment
hispanic
populations
in
miami...
or
the
state
had
drawn
lines
that
had
the
effect
of
fragmenting
hispanics
in
the
state
of
miami...
i'm
sorry,
excuse
me,
in
dade
county.
and
what
the
court
was
saying
was
that
was
where
the
dilution...
you
could
kind
of...
you
could
point
to
it
there.
and
it
was
focusing
on
all
of
the
evidence
that
it
heard
at
trial
about
whether
those
districts
were
viable
and
whether...
and
whether
that
fragmentation
of
the
hispanic
populations
had
occurred.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
would
agree
with
you
that
it
cuts
against
my...
our
point
of
view.
what
i
would
say
is
that
if
you...
you
can't
look
at
this
case
and
make
sense
of
what
happened
in
terms
of
8
days,
or
however
many
it
was,
at
the
end
of
june
in
1992.
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
case.
and
there
had
already
been
another
opinion
issued
in
the
case
that
had
extensive
findings,
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
findings
that
were
made
here
in
light
of
that
and
in
light
of
all
of
the
evidence.
if
the
court...
i
think
if
you
look
at
all
of
that,
you
see
that
it
was
a
statewide
claim
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
that...
first
of
all,
i
don't
think...
well,
as
to
compactness,
i
don't
know
what
it
would
mean
to
say
that
they're
compact
statewide.
counsel
talked
about
davis
and
bandemer.
there
was
no
showing
in
davis
and
bandemer
that
the
democrats
were
throughout
the
state
in
some
proportion,
or
only
in
one
part
of
the
state,
or
several
parts
of
the
state.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
can
cite
you
the
voluminous
exhibits
showing
the
runs
of
election
after
election.
i
mean
there...
it
is...
the
hispanics
in
florida
are
not
uniform,
nor
does
any
minority
group
vote
uniform
anywhere.
and
there
are
local
variations
and
there's
also...
it
just...
and
even
in
any
given
locality,
the
minority
group
is
not
going
to
vote
100
percent
cohesively.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
if
you
look
at
the...
the
jsf
in
that,
i
think
'92,
5/19,
if
you
look
at
page
79a,
they...
the
court
says
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
and
carrying
over
to
the
next
one:
"the
parties
agree"...
"the
parties
agree
that
racially
polarized
voting
exists
throughout
florida
to
varying
degrees.
"
"the
results
of
florida's
legislative
elections
over
the
past
10
years
established
the
presence
of
racially
polarized
voting.
"
racially
polarized
voting,
as
this
court
knows
and
as
was
made
clear
in
gingles,
has
two
components:
that
the
minority
group
votes
cohesively
and
that
the
majority
votes
usually
as
a
bloc
to
defeat
minority
candidates.
there
are
also...
that
same
finding
in
different
terms,
and
sometimes
in
stronger
terms,
i
think
as
i
was
saying
before,
was
made
by
the
special
master...
some
of
these
other
things
are
in
the
joint
appendix
and
not
in
the
jsf.
and
the
independent
expert--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
but
this
opinion
clearly
addresses...
they
then
go
on
to
give
some
specific
facts
about
african-americans,
but
the
opinion
addresses
the
voting
rights
situation
with
respect
to
both
hispanics
and
african-americans.
the
whole
litigation
was
concerned
about
both
groups
and
in
the
congressional
phase
they
were
extremely
concerned
with
both
groups
as
to
whether
they
were
going
to...
whether
they
were
required
to
draw
districts
for
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
well
i
can--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think...
that's
how
i
read
the
finding
that
there's
racially
polarized
voting
in
florida.
i
think
the
natural...
that
the
natural
meaning
of
those
words
is
that,
especially
in
the
context
of
a
case
where
this
was
the
type
of
issue
that
was
litigated
throughout.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
your
honor,
the...
if
you...
the...
if
you
go
beyond
the
three-judge
court,
it
adopted
findings
that
a
special
master
had
made.
as
i
recall,
the
special
master's
findings
were
in
similar
terms.
but
both
the
court
and
the
special
master
adopted
other
findings
that
were
made
by
an
independent
expert.
and
it's
not
that
any
of
these
findings
disagreed
with
each
other
in
any
way,
but
the
independent
expert,
for
instance,
on
the
joint...
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
103,
said
it
is...
he
lists
a
bunch
of
things
that
he
thinks
are
beyond
dispute.
and
he
says
there
is,
quote:
"racially
polarized
voting,
whereby
african-americans
or
hispanics
vote
one
way,
and
whites
or
anglos
vote
another.
"
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
doesn't?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
that
was
an
issue,
yes.
we
don't
agree
that
that
was...
we
think
that
that
really
didn't
need
to
be
an
issue
in
the
case,
and
that
the
problem
was
that
we
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
show
that
there
could
be
a
remedy
for
both
groups.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think...
well
i
think
i
can
only
make...
perhaps
answer
that
by
repeating,
i
think,
what
i
said
before,
which
is
the
question
is
whether
hispanics
in
the
state
of
florida
vote
cohesively.
it
has
been
shown
in
this
case
that
there...
well,
it
has
been
shown
in
this
case
that
no
hispanic,
for
example,
was
elected
to
the
florida
state
senate
until
1988,
never,
that
no
hispanic
was
elected
to
congress
until
1989.
that
hispanics...
there
were
findings
that
hispanics
do
not
win
elections
in
florida
unless
they're
in
the
majority
of
a
district.
maybe
that
supplies
the...
what's...
what
you...
clarifies
what
these
findings
are.
but
all
of
these
findings
point
in
the
same
direction,
that
where
hispanics
are
in
the
majority
in
a
district,
they
get
the
opportunity
to
elect
the
candidates
of
their
choice,
and
where
they're
not,
they
don't.
and
i
think
that
there
were
experts
who
testified
to
support
the
independent
expert's
and
special
master's
findings,
and
so
on.
but,
in
any
event,
that...
i
think
they
all
mutually
support
each
other,
which
is
that
in
the
state...
in
the
state,
as
a
whole,
hispanics
vote
cohesively.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i
do.
and
i
think
if
there's
some
doubt
about
what...
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
61,
at
103,
there's
expert
testimony,
81,
209,
38,
266,
if
you
look
at
all
those
and
you
still
don't
think
that
it's
made
out
on
a
statewide
basis,
i
think
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
would
be
to
remand
the
case
and
let
the
district
court
make
the
finding
that
you
would
find
would
not
have
been
made.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
the
only
reason
i
refer...
this
is...
the
only
reason
i
refer
to
the
testimony
is
because
there
are,
in
addition
to
the
opinion
that
was...
that
the
court
issued
on
july
17th,
there
was
the
previous
congressional
opinion
and
the
special
master's
and
independent
expert's
opinions,
which
were
specifically
adopted
by
the
court.
and
all
of
those
make
findings
about
racially
polarized
voting
in
the
state
of
florida.
i
only
raised--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
i
only
raised
the
testimony
because
that
was
what
the
finding
was
based
on.
and,
in
turn,
the
testimony
was
attached
to
quite
voluminous
exhibits
showing
the
election
runs
in
florida
and
how
people
vote.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
district
court's
opinion,
with
due
respect
to
the
court,
was
written
hastily.
and
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
context
in
each
case.
i
think
the
court
tended
at
times--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
the
answer
is
sometimes
yes
and
sometimes
no.
[laughter]
and
they
have
to
look
at
the...
you
have
to
look
at
the
context
of
it.
again,
i
would
emphasize
that
the
questions
that
we've
been...
the
things
i've
been
talking
about
really
go
to
whether...
to
the
nature
of
the
findings
that
were
made
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
and
if
the
court
ultimately
doesn't
agree
with
us
that
those
findings
were
made
by
the
court,
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
would
be
to
remand
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
to...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence.
but
the
district
court
simply...
they
entered
judgment
for
us
and
they
didn't...
they
didn't...
if
the
court
finds
that
the
court,
the
district
court
didn't
specify,
for
instance,
whether
hispanics
in
the
state
of
florida,
as
a
whole,
are
or
are
not
cohesive,
then
that's
a
finding
that
simply
has
to
be
made
one
way
or
the
other.
they...
certainly
the
district
court
never
said
that
hispanics
were
not
cohesive
in
the
state
of
florida.
if
the
court
had
said
that,
then
i
think
it
would
be...
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
probably
would
be
to
reverse.
there
might
still
be
additional
issues
remaining
in
the
case
on
other
points.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's...
that
would
be
what
i
would
say,
yes.
but
in
any
event,
all
of
these
things
go...
none
of
these
go
to
our
central
premise,
which
is
that...
the
question...
you
have
to
look
statewide
to
determine...
the
appropriate
measure
for
whether
a
state's
districting
plan
fragments
or
dilutes
the
votes
of
the
black
community,
you
have
to
look
statewide.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
actually,
yes,
i
think
there
is.
i
think
davis
against
bandemer
looked
at
the
whole
state
when
it
was
looking
at
a
very
similar
type
of
claim.
i
also
think
that
the
four
justices
in
shaw
against
reno
who
dissented,
who
analyzed
the
case
quite
different
from
the
majority...
the
way
the
majority
did.
but
the
majority
didn't
suggest
that
vote
dilution
claims
of
the
sort
that
the
dissent
didn't...
wouldn't
have
existed.
that
those
four
justices
had
looked
at
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
concluding
that
whites
in
north
carolina
were
not
disproportionately
represented.
i
also
think
i
might
have
misspoke.
what
we're
really
talking
about
here
is...
in
a
relatively
minor
way.
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the...
is
proportional
representation
in
the
state
of
florida.
that's
only
one
factor
that
has
to
be
considered
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances'
analysis.
and
i
don't
want
to
suggest...
it
is...
although
i
think
it
bears
very
heavy
weight,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
conclusive.
and
i
think
mr.
klein
characterized
our
position
that
way,
but
i
think
it's
possible
claims
could
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i'm
not...
i
guess
i
would
have
one...
initially,
i'm
not
sure
what
maximizing
would
mean
there?
does
that
mean--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
we've
never--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
a
state
can
reasonably
act,
for
instance,
to
preclude
a
section
2
claim.
and
if
that
requires
drawing
as
many
districts
in
an
area,
or
in
the
state
or
wherever
it
is,
in
which
the
minority
group
would
be
the
majority,
then
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
proper
thing
to
do.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
they
cannot
be
found?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
you
know,
i
would
hesitate
to
hazard
an
answer
to
that.
i
think
that
would
raise
questions...
i
guess
the
question
would
be
whether
that
would
be
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
a
delicate...
the
question
would
be
whether
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
would
certainly
agree
that
the
district
court
is
obligated
simply
to
remedy
the
section
2
violations.
but
it
found
section
2
violations,
and
i
think
the
record
supported
those
findings.
and
i
do
think
that
if
you...
if
you
arbitrarily
limit
the
proportional
representation
part
of
the
analysis
to
dade
county,
you're
going
to
lead
to
very
odd
results
in
different
sorts
of
cases
where
people
are
trying
to
draw
smaller
or
larger
circles.
in
fact,
even
in
dade
county
there
are--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think
the
answer...
i
think
that's...
that's
one
way...
that's
slightly
mischaracterizing
what's
happening.
what
is
happening
here
is
that
you
have...
the
whole
premise
of
the
statute
is
based
on
an
idea
of
a
group's
rights
and
a
group's
fair,
equal
opportunities
to
participate
and
elect.
and
you're
necessarily
abstracting
from
individuals
when
you
do
that.
that's
going
to
be
true,
though,
even
if
you
look
at
dade
county.
there
are
individual
hispanics
in
dade
county
who
don't
live
in
hispanic-majority
districts
and
who
don't...
wouldn't
live
in
hispanic-majority
districts
under
any
conceivable
plan.
now,
under
mr.
klein's
analysis
are
we
supposed
to
exclude
those
from
the
proportional
representation
analysis?
are
we
just
supposed
to
look
at
where
you
can
draw
the
majority
hispanic
districts
under
the
state's
plan,
just
the
people
who
live
there,
or
under
our
plan
or
what
alternative?
thank
you.
