mr.
c.
allen
foster
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
contrast
to
what
i
believe
has
been
the
tenor
of
the
argument
so
far,
this
is
not
a
maximization
case.
in
this
case
the
plaintiffs
have
not
only
proved
the
gingles
preconditions
factors,
they
proved
all
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
factors,
and
in
addition,
over
and
above
all
of
that,
they
proved
disparate
treatment.
what
the
plaintiffs
are
saying
in
this
case
is
they
want
to
be
treated...
when
districts
are
drawn
in
neighborhoods
where
they
live,
they
want
to
be
treated
the
same
way
that
anglos
are
treated
when
districts
are
drawn
in
anglo
neighborhoods.
that's
what
the
plaintiffs
are
saying,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
have
asked
the
clerk
to
give
you
these
maps
that
you
have
in
front
of
you,
because
i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
first
map.
this
is
plaintiffs'
exhibit
5
and
this
is
the
state
plan
which
was
challenged
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
for
you
to
look
up
where
you
can
see
the
91
in
this
yellow
district.
that's
fort
lauderdale.
and
i
would
like
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
blue
district,
that
rather
oddly
shaped
blue
district
that
splatters
its
way
across
broward
county
there.
and
i
believe
that
you
will
agree,
after
your
experience
in
show
v.
reno,
that
you
would
suspect
that
this
is
a
minority
district
that
was
created
for
minorities.
it
is
not.
it
is
an
anglo
district.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
actually,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
can
take
your
pick,
both
of
them
are
anglo
districts.
but
i'm
talking
about
the
cobalt
blue
just
to
the
left
of
where
it
says
fort
lauderdale.
actually,
fort
lauderdale
is
written
across
part
of
that
district.
this
is
an
anglo
district,
as
is
district
90,
and
if
you
looked
at
district
99,
that's
an
anglo
district,
as
is
district
101,
which
is
right
on
the
border
of
broward
and
dade
county
and
actually
dips
down
into
dade
county
to
submerge
some
spanish
voters...
or
hispanic
voters
that
are
in
dade
county.
and
if
you
look
down
in
dade
county
at
district
119,
which
is
the
gray
district
toward
the
bottom,
that
is
an
anglo
district.
and
all
the
hispanic
voters
in
this
case
have
asked
the
court
below
to
do
is
to
have
districts
drawn
where
they
live
that
are
just...
that
utilize
the
same
districting
criteria
that
the
state
legislature
used
to
draw
districts
in
anglo
neighborhoods.
that's
all
they're
asking,
but
that's
not
what
they
got.
because
if
you
use
the
same
districting
criteria
that
were
used
to
draw
the
districts
in
the
anglo
neighborhoods,
you
will
get
11
hispanic
seats
in
the
dade
county
area...
not
dade
county,
and
i'll
turn
to
that
in
just
a
minute,
because
that's
another
misconception
that
we're--
mr.
c.
allen
foster
--in
this
particular
case
i
think
we
might
well
be
entitled
to
it,
justice
kennedy.
because
if
you
take
the
statistics
of
hispanic
population
in
the
dade
county
area
and
if
you
truly
maximize...
this
is
not
a
maximization
case.
we
never
asked
for
the
maximum
number
of
districts.
we
asked
for
the
number
of
districts
that
could
be
drawn
if
you
used
the
same
criteria
that
was
used
for
anglo
districts.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
maximum
number
of
districts
is.
there's
nothing
there.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
no,
sir.
they...
although
they
certainly
are
funny
looking,
they
were
drawn...
they
respect
anglo
neighborhoods,
they
respect
anglo
incumbents.
of
course,
the
number
of
hispanics
that
could
be
elected
was
coming
up
and
so
there
weren't
as
many
incumbents
to
respect.
but
if
you
respect
hispanic
neighborhoods
in
the
dade
county
area,
if
you
just
respect
and
don't
split,
don't
pack
their
neighborhoods,
if
you
treat
them
the
same
way
that
anglo
neighborhoods
were
treated
in
this...
in
both
broward
and
dade
counties,
you
will
get
11
hispanic
districts
and
you
will
4
hispanic
senate
districts.
if
you
just
treat
them
equally--
mr.
c.
allen
foster
--no,
ma'am.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
no,
ma'am.
there's
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
any
other
group,
other
than...
the
groups
that
were
considered
were
the
african-americans,
the
hispanics,
and
the
anglos.
the
anglos
were
going
down
in
numbers
of
seats,
and...
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
and
if
you
try--
mr.
c.
allen
foster
--that
will
pack.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
in
fairness...
in
fairness,
your
honor,
to
what
the
plaintiffs
tried
to
do
in
this
case
and
what
the
district
court
adopted,
the
plaintiffs'
plan
did
respect
communities.
it
respected
anglo
communities,
it
respected
hispanic
communities,
and
it
respected
african-american
communities.
and
that's
the
reason
why...
the
district
court
was
faced
with
two
plans,
one
put
forward
by
the
state
which
demonstrably
did
not
respect
hispanic
communities.
it
demonstrably
split
and
packed
hispanic
communities.
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
faced
with
another
plan
put
forward
by
the
plaintiffs
which
didn't
do
that,
which
treated
hispanics
and
african-americans
the
same
way
that
it
treated
anglo
voters.
and
the
court...
and
we
think
this
is
exactly
what
section
2
commands,
the
court
chose
the
one
that
treated
everyone
alike.
and
that's
what...
section
2
commands
that
everyone
have
the
equal
opportunity.
and
it
is
the
plaintiffs'
plan
and
only
the
plaintiffs'
plan
that
offers--
mr.
c.
allen
foster
--yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
it
both...
it...
number
one,
we
proved
all
three
of
the
gingles
preconditions.
number
two,
the
court
carefully
considered
the
zimmer
factors
and
found
that
they
supported.
and
number
three,
the
court...
while
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
whether
there
are
findings
or
not,
as
justice
souter
says,
the
court
goes
through
the
testimony
and
it
certainly,
i
think,
fairly
appears
to
me
that
the
court
is
citing
with
approval
the
testimony
that
finds
disparate
treatment.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
well,
sir,
i'm
glad
you
brought
up
that
point.
would
you
turn
to
map
number
3.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
yes,
sir.
no
one's
talking
about
dade
county
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i'd
like
to
demonstrate
that
to
you.
what
you've
heard
previously
simply
is
not
the
fact.
please
look
at
map
number
3,
and
i'd
like
to
demonstrate
to
you
what
i'm
talking
about.
map
number
3
shows...
you
can
see
district
number
102,
it's
the
light-blue
district
that
stretches
all
the
way
from
miami
and
goes
over
to
naples.
it's
over
100
miles
long.
that
is
a
district
which
the
state
must
count
in
order
to
make
out
their
case
for
proportionality.
now,
they
have
come
in
here
and
they
have
told
you
that
we're
only
talking
about
dade
county,
right.
that
district
has
three
times
as
much
land
in
collier
county
in
it
as
it
does
in
dade
county.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
yes,
sir.
and
if
you'll
look
at--
mr.
c.
allen
foster
--it's
an
hispanic
district,
sir,
and
they
have
to
count
it
in
order
to
get
proportionality.
they
cannot
get
their
so-called
proportionality
unless
they
count
district
102.
and
it
is
no
more
dade
county
than
a
man
in
the
moon.
also,
if
you
will
look--
mr.
c.
allen
foster
--just
a
wee
bit.
and
it
doesn't...
you
can
look
and
see
where
it
goes
over
into
dade
county.
it's
more
than
a
wee
bit,
it's
about
25
percent
dade
county
and
about
75
percent
collier
county.
it
most
certainly
doesn't--
mr.
c.
allen
foster
--areawise
and
i
don't
remember
the
precise
figures,
but
i
think
that's
pretty
close
to
populationwise
as
well.
also,
if
you
will
look
on
your
first
map,
district
101
that
i
pointed
out
to
you
which
is
at
the
border
of
broward
county
and
dade
county,
the
only
aspect
of
dade
county
that
is
included
in
district
101
is
that
infinitesimal
little
yellow
blip
that
comes
down
into
the
light
blue.
that's
what...
that
is
where
they
are
trying
to
say
that
we
limited
our
proof
to
dade
county
and
for
that
reason,
somehow
or
another,
you
can't
take
into
account
anything
else.
they're
taking
into
account
district
101
which
is
99
percent,
in
population
and
area,
in
broward
county.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
that
happens
to
be
a
white
district,
an
anglo
district.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
that's
true.
but
the
point
is
that
their...
that
their
analysis
makes
no
sense.
their
analysis
does
not
tell
us
anything--
mr.
c.
allen
foster
--barely,
by
the
fact
that
you're
dropping
one
number
from
the
numerator
and
one
from
the
denominator.
but
the
point
is
that
their
analysis...
if
you
focus
down
on
any
one
single
district...
if
you
focus
on
district
114,
for
example,
which
is
this
one
to
the
left
of
the
pink
district
here
in
dade
county,
and
if
you
focus
on
that
and
you
say
let's
just
look
at
that
district,
then
hispanics
are
84
percent
of
the
population
there
and
they
have
100
percent
of
the
seats,
so
they're
underrepresented.
and
then,
as
a
matter
of
logic,
as
the
circle
grows
wider
you
will
reach
a
point
where
there
is
proportional
representation.
and
then
as
the
circle
gets
bigger
than
that,
there
will
be
underrepresentation.
that
is
true
any
time
you
have
a
concentrated
minority.
it
will
always
be
true.
if
you
think
about
it
in
terms
of
a
target
with
a
bull's-eye
and
a
lot
of
concentric
circles
around
the
bull's-eye.
as
you
go
from
the
bull's-eye...
which
is
the
concentration
of
minorities
where
you
may
well
have
over
representation
because
the
minorities
may
have
all
the
seats,
but
as
you
pointed
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
less
than
100
percent
of
population.
and
as
you
go
out
from
that
circle
into
anglo
areas,
the
successive
dilutive
effect
of
the
increased
anglo
areas
is
going
to
change
the
numbers.
what
this
is
saying
is
that
any
analysis
that
does
not
go
to
the
whole
jurisdiction,
the
state,
simply
hasn't
told
you
anything.
it's
not
probative
because
you
can
pick
and
choose,
you
can
cherry-pick
the
area
that
you
want
to
pick
and
you
can
prove
anything
with
the
numbers.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
these
are
plaintiffs'
exhibits.
this
is
the
state's
plan.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
that
is
true.
our
case
was
focused
on
south
florida,
because
that
is
where
the
minority...
the
hispanic
population
is
primarily
concentrated.
but
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
view
that
certainly
there
are
findings
in
this
record
having
to
do
with
all
of
the
factors
which
pertain
to
hispanics
in
the
entire
state
of
florida.
and
i
simply
think
an
analysis
that
focuses
on
anything
less
than
the
total
jurisdiction
hasn't
told
us
anything.
i
would
only
like
to
make
one
other
point,
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
senate.
if
you
will
look
at
map
number
2...
because
this,
again,
tells
you
how
much
further
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
gone
than
just
is
required
by
the
plurality
opinion
in
gingles.
in
fact,
i
think
we've
satisfied
all
of
the
conditions
that
justice
o'connor
mentioned
in
her
concurring
opinion.
because
here
you
have
district
32,
which
is
the
blue
district.
this
an
anglo
district
which
has
come
down,
crossed
the
dade
county
line...
again,
they're
not
limiting
their
districts
to
dade
county.
it
crosses
the
dade
county
line
and
submerges
the
hispanics
that
live
in
this
portion
of
north
hialeah,
which
is
right
there
below
the
dade
county
area.
down
at
the
bottom,
the
purple
district
you
have,
which
is
an
anglo
district,
creates
a
wall
that
separates
the
otherwise
cohesive
minority...
hispanic
minority
populations
in
south
miami.
that
wall
runs
up
highway
1,
if
you've
ever
driven
down
to
the
keys.
like
the
district
you
looked
at
in
shaw
v.
reno,
during
most
of
the
area
where
it
runs
up
highway
1...
and
you
can
barely
see
it
on
the
map...
it's
no
wider
than
the
highway.
but
this
is
an
anglo
district
that
was
created.
and
what
these
plaintiffs
are
complaining
about
is
that
they
haven't
been
treated
equally.
that
is
the
very
violation
that
section
2
speaks
to,
not
only
in
its
words
but
i
believe
philosophically.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
district
30.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
oh,
the
yellow
one,
district
31.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
that
is
an
anglo
district.
and
i
would
also
point
out,
justice
stevens,
that
it
makes
it
look
a
lot
prettier
than
it
really
is,
because
the
line
as
drawn
by
the
computer
here
goes
offshore
for
4
or
5
miles.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
the
yellow
district,
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
oh.
the
little
purple
district.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
oh,
i
see.
i
believe
that's
an
african-american
district.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
that
wasn't
my
case,
sir.
[laughter]
it
was
not
necessary,
under
any
circumstances,
to
draw
districts
like
that
that
respected
hispanic
communities
of
interest.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
allen
foster
thank
you.
