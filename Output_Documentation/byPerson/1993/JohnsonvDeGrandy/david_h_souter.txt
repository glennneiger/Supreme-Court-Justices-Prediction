justice
david
h.
souter
well
do
you
take...
excuse
me,
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
is...
necessarily,
it
is
a
dispositive
upper
limitation,
or
do
you
say
that
it
is
a
relevant
consideration
in
deciding
what
the
upper
limit
should
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
it
is
dispositive.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
fair
to
say
that
in
this
case
we
would
not
have
to
go
that
far
to
accept
your
position,
because
i
gather
in
this
case,
basically,
we've
got
a
record
in
which
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
other
explanation
than
a
maximization
principle.
so
we
would
not
have
to
hold
that
it
was
dispositive
in
every
case
in
order
to
reject
the
maximization
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're...
in
so
many
words
you're
saying
that
this
is
strictly
a
results
kind
of
test.
i
mean
equality--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
a
bottom-line
equality,
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
discrimination
that
may
have
occurred,
i
think,
in
judge
easterbrook's
phrase,
along
the
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
if
you
get
a
result
which
is
consistent
with
proportionality,
it
doesn't
matter
that
that
result
may,
in
fact,
have
been
arrived
at
through
various
discriminations
along
the
way
which
just
happen
to
work
out
numerically
in
a
way
which,
on
the
face
of
it,
gives
equality.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
a
section
2.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
is
that
term?
it's
not
in...
it's
not
in
section
2.
i
mean,
that's
not
in
section
2,
so.
section
2
speaks
of
any
citizen,
which
is
what
one
would
have
thought
it
said:
"which
results
in
the
denial
or
abridgment
of
the
right
of
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
vote
on
account
on
account
of
race
or
color.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
well
you
have...
it's
a
capacity
to
form
a
group,
isn't
it?
i
mean
isn't
that
perhaps
the
way
to
reconcile
it
with
traditional...
the
traditional
fourteenth
amendment
jurisprudence.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
further
you
get
beyond
it,
the
riskier
it
is,
though.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
does
that
become
relevant
to
the
race
or
color
criterion
of
section
2?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
just
the
1973(b),
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
may...
we
may
have
difficulty
in
figuring
out
what
the
findings
are,
but
do
you
agree
that
if
we
do
not
read
those
findings
as
establishing
dilution
outside
of
dade
county,
that
the
hispanic
population
outside
of
dade
county
cannot
legitimately
be
taken
into
consideration
for
purposes
of
the
maximization
that
went
on
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
question
of
your
interpretive
criterion.
when
you
speak
of
findings,
do
you...
do
you
account
it
as
a
finding
by
the
court
when
the
court
simply
recites...
or
strike
the
word
simply,
when
the
court
recites
a
summary
of
testimony
by
expert
witnesses?
for
example,
i
think
twice
in
your
brief
you
refer
to
findings
on
the
court
on
page
43a
of
the
petition
appendix,
of
fragmentation
of
the
hispanic
population
within
dade
county.
and
i
looked
at
that
twice,
and
i
don't
see
any
findings
there.
what
i
do
see
is
a
repetition
by
the
court
of
summaries
of
what
witnesses
said.
this
one
testified
this,
that
one
testified
that.
are
you
counting
those
recitations
as
findings
by
the
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
answer
to
my
question,
then,
is
yes,
you
are--
