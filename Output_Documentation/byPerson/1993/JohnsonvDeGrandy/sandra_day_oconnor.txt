o'connor
well,
even...
i
had
thought
perhaps
a
statewide
basis
was
the
proper
focus.
but
if
the
proof
at
trial
of
those
complaining
is
limited
to,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
dade
county,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
need
to
go
beyond
that
now.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
enough
to
dispose
of
the
case,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
proof,
by
everybody,
basically
focused
on
dade
county.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
feldman,
i
assume
we
are
looking
at
this
case
and
this
judgment,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
the
district
court
in
this
case
that
we're
reviewing
make
any
vote
dilution
findings
outside
of
dade
county?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
paragraph
you
refer
to...
us
to,
starting
on
page
79a
does
appear,
at
least,
at
the
end
of
the
paragraph,
to
refer
just
to
african-americans.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
there
other
previous
proceedings
in
the
same
case?
do
we
have
to
look
at
other
proceedings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
to
look
at
other
findings
and
opinions?
