justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
said
you
don't
think
the
majorities
have
a
cause
of
action,
you
decide
the
majority
by
looking
statewide
or
at
dade
county?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
but
there's...
i
don't
think
the
majority...
i
don't
think
the
white
people
are
a
majority
in
dade
county.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
section
2
looks
at
the
entire
state,
is
that
the
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wouldn't
apply
to
whites
even
if
whites
are
a
minority
in
the
covered
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
i
suppose
there
would--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
discriminated
on
account
of
race,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
comply
with
the
statute,
then,
in...
say
dade
county
was
electing
just
county
officers
rather
than
the
state
legislature,
if
they
contrived
a
plan
that
denied
whites
a
majority
in
any
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
think
it
would
comply
with
the
statute
because
whites
are
not
a
group
that's
defined
by
color.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
to
go
to
the
legislative
history
to
find...
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
as...
out
of
curiosity,
what
is
the
defining
characteristic
of
the
hispanic
group
we're
talking
about?
is
it
the
language
in
1973,
or
is
it
the
race
or
the
color?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
refers
to
spanish
heritage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
could
you...
there's
an
awful
lot
of
pages
here
to
look
through,
as
we
understand.
could
you
pinpoint
what
you
think
is
the
strongest
statement
in
any
of
the
three
opinions
saying
that
they're
cohesive
statewide
and
compact
statewide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
think
a
lot
of
the
people
assume
that
within
the
hispanic
community
there
are
cuban
americans
who
tend
to
vote
very
regular...
very
conservative
republicans,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
agricultural
workers
and
the
rest,
who
have
a
different
hispanic
origin,
who
tend
to
vote
democratic.
i
assume
that's
true
in
florida.
it's
probably
true
nationwide.
does
there...
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
tell
us?
for
example,
do
the
hispanics
in
the
tampa
area
vote
the
same
way
as
the
cuban
americans
in
miami,
or
anything...
any
light
on
that
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
apart
from
looking
at
reams
and
reams
of
exhibits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
statement
anywhere
that
is
as
succinct
as
the
one
the
chief
justice
pointed
you
to,
but
pointing
in
the
opposite
direction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
statement
that
racially
polarized
voting
exists
throughout
florida
to
varying
degrees
could
mean
that
in
dade
county
there's
racially
polarized
voting
among
blacks
that
is
contra
to
the
way
the
cuban
americans
vote,
and
that
there's
racially
polarized
voting
in
tampa
that's
contra
to
either
of
those
two
groups.
i
mean,
it
really
doesn't...
that
certainly
doesn't
tell
us
that
all
hispanics
vote...
tend
to
vote
in
the
same
way.
indeed,
the
rest
of
that
paragraph
doesn't
even
speak
about
hispanics.
it
speaks
about
african-americans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
what
are
the
criteria
used
in
drawing
anglo
districts
that
you
say
should
have
been
used,
to
draw
funny
looking
shapes
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
that
district,
is
that
an
anglo
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
hispanic
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
you
gained
by
having
them
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
left
out
both
101
and
102,
the
proportion
of
hispanic
representation
would
be
even
higher.
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
what
is
district
30,
is
that
an
anglo
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
long
tall
one
up
between--
--yellow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
not
yellow,
the
one
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
yellow
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
one
immediately
to
the
one
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
district,
the
purple
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
long--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
do
you
have
any
problem
with
the
way
that's
drawn?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
to
respect
the
african-americans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
where
this
is
coming...
you're
telling
us
what
the
record
shows
about
voting
patterns
by
hispanics
in
other
parts
of
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
are
they
different
because
they...
one
group
votes
democratic
and
the
other
votes
republican,
or
are
they
also
different
because
they
have
different
ethnic
backgrounds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
this
statute,
if
one
group
of
hispanics
with
one
ethnic
background
achieves
sufficient
political
power
to
take
advantage
of
another
group
of
hispanics
of
a
different
ethnic
background,
would
the
statute
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
two
cohesive
groups,
both
hispanic
but
different
ethnic
backgrounds,
one
is
strong
enough
to
discriminate
against
the
other
successfully.
would
the
statute
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question...
another
question
there.
did
you
hear
the
argument
in
the
preceding
case,
the
similar
case
this
morning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
they
suggested
that
five
districts
should
be
drawn
in
place
of
one.
are
you
arguing
that
in
order
to
sustain
that
argument
they'd
have
to
prove
that
all
the
relevant
minority
voters
were
in
the
one
district
that
would
be
minority
black?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
they
shouldn't
even
count
the
black
voters
who
are
not
within
the
black
majority
district
that
might
be
created.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
in
determining
whether
there's
a
violation
or
whether
there's
dilution,
you
ignore
the
other
8
percent?
