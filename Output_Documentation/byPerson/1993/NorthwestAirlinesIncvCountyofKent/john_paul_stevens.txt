justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
true,
that's
a
violation
of
a
different
statute.
you
don't
claim
a
cause
of
action
under
the
airport
and
airway
improvement
act,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
violation
of
that
statute
that
you're
describing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
perhaps
a
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
essential
to
your
case
that
there
be
a
finding
that
there
has
been
an
unreasonable
surplus
that
violates
section
2210?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
wonder
if
there
was
any
duty
to...
the
duty
in
that
section
is
to
spend
the
money
on
airport
improvements,
and
they...
you're
not
alleging
they've
spent
the
money
on
anything
else,
and
then
the
government
says,
you
also
can't
accumulate
too
large
a
surplus,
but
i
don't
know
that
you've
alleged
they've
accumulated
too
large
a
surplus,
have
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
order
to
avoid
the
violation
of
that
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
were
no
section
2210,
they
could
go
into
the
business
of
selling
parking
spaces
and
so
forth
and
make
all
the
money
in
the
world
and
not
use
it
on
the
airport.
it's
only
because
of
the
existence
of
2210
that
you
have
a
claim
based
on
the
excess
surplus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
just
going
to
the
excess
profits
made
by
the
concessions
and
putting
on
one
side
the
general
aviation
question
for
the
moment,
would
your
objection
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
be
cured
if
the
county
charged...
cut
the
rent
to
the
concessionaires
in
half,
or
whatever
it
was,
so
they
did
not
make
any
profit
any
more
out
of
the
concessions?
they
would
continue
to
pay...
charge
the
airlines
exactly
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
gather
those...
the
concession
revenues
and
all,
they
make
money
by
renting
out
parking
spaces
and
the
rental
car
agencies
and
things
like
that.
if
they
charged
them
a
lesser
rent
so
it
was
no
longer
quite
as
profitable
as
it
is,
would
your
objection
then,
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
fees
you
pay,
be
cured?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
costs
you're
talking
about,
are
they
costs
in
the
terminal,
or
are
you
talking
about
runway
maintenance,
or
what
are
you
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
air
side
costs,
you
mean
the
nonoperational
stuff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
totally
eliminated
that,
they
just
closed
all
those
concessions
but
continued
to
operate
the
same
runways
and
charge
you
the
same...
well,
they
couldn't
do
that,
because
they'd
have
to
have
the
terminal
then,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
that
i
don't
understand
you
to
be
challenging
the
reasonableness
of
the
charges
for
what
you
actually
use.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
argument
on
the
merits,
assuming
it's
here
for
a
second.
you
cite
a
case
involving
the
boston
airport
which
arose
under
the
anti-head-tax
act.
are
there
any
administrative
proceedings
that
have
been
pursued
under
the
other
statute,
the
airport
and
airway
improvement
act,
where
you've
challenged
an
airport's
building
up
an
excess
of
surplus
or
improper
use
of
funds
that
have
accumulated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there's
really
no
law
on
this
issue
about
whether
a
surplus
can
sometimes
be
too
large,
or
something,
or
they
can
review
it
after
the
fact,
because
that
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
conditions
for
a
monetary
grant,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
would
be
standards
that
would
apply--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
advance
to
future
grants
of
money
to...
are
there
any
proceedings
where
a
particular
airport
authority
has
been
punished
in
any
way
or
sanctioned
in
any
way
for
failure
to
comply
with
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
the
money
is
delivered,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
certainly
can't
represent
that
the
district
judge
when
he
looks
at
the
case
and
reads
our
opinion
that
can
argue...
we
may
say
there's
no
cause
of
action
here...
might
say,
well,
there's
nothing
for
me
to
do,
then.
isn't
that
a
possibility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
you
urged
him
otherwise,
faithfully
to
your
representation
to
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
that
happened,
the
petitioner
would
lose
the
benefit
of
a
portion
of
his
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
law
of
the
case
would
be
there
never
was
a
private
cause
of
action
in
the
first
place.
that
would
be
the
law
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
did
not
cross-petition
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
understand
you
to
be
arguing
it
would
be
too
difficult
to
collect
a
landing
fee
from
a
private
aircraft?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
then
i
thought
you
went
on
to
say
because
you
don't
know
what
the
schedule
is
you
couldn't
collect
a
uniform
fee
from
the
general
aviation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
every
time
they
land
the
tower
knows--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
certainly
not
impossible.
