mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
appears
today
primarily
to
support
respondent's
position
that
ratemaking
disputes
such
as
this
one
concerning
user
fees
charged
to
air
carriers
by
the
nation's
numerous
local
airports
belong
initially
in
an
administrative
rather
than
a
judicial
forum.
neither
the
anti-head-tax
act
on
which
petitioners'
claim
relies,
nor
the
faa...
federal
aviation
act
of
which
it
is
a
part...
nor
any
other
statute
provides
explicitly
for
the
private
enforcement
of
any
right
that
may
be
conferred
by
section
1513(b),
which
petitioners
rely
on.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
they
might
very
well.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
we
think
that
proceeding
would
normally
be
brought
in
state
court.
first
of
all,
that
issue
arises
whether
or
not
there's
a
private
right
of
action
for
the
airlines
affirmatively
to
go
in
and
challenge
those.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
think
the
congress
assumed,
or
intended,
that
these
issues
would
be
dealt
with
primarily
by
the
secretary,
and...
for
instance,
we
believe
that
a
state
court
faced
with
this
issue
might
very
well
say
one
of
two
things,
either
that
it
would
defer
to
the
secretary's
determination
of
reasonableness,
to
the
extent
that
was
the
issue,
or
that
it
would
simply
refuse
to
hold
the
fees
unreasonable
unless
the
airlines
could
produce
evidence
from
the
secretary
that
the
secretary
believed
them
to
be
so.
that
would
be
a
fairly
conventional
sort
of
deference
to
administrative
agency
primary
jurisdiction
theory.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
have
no
position
on
whether
a
state
court
would
be
required
to
do
that.
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
federal
court
if
the
issue
arose
in
that
posture.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
not
aware
of
a
specific
case,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
think
that's
an
open
question,
yes,
and
we
also
think
that,
as
i
said,
it
arises
no
matter
what
the
decision
is
on
the
private
right
question,
and
that
the
question
should
be
looked
at
independently.
for
instance,
there
are
cases
this
court
has
looked
at...
for
instance,
the
second
pennhurst
decision,
which
quite
clearly
state
the
view
that
whether
or
not
a
federal
issue
may
be
diverted
to
state
court
by
the
appropriate
decision
on
a
particular
point
of
federal
law,
that
is
simply
a
consequence
that
may
be
accepted.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
think
the
defense
remains
in
one
guise
or
another,
and
for
instance,
we
think
it
would
be
quite
appropriate
for
an
airline
to
pay
this
tax
under
protest
and
then
either
sue
for
a
refund
or,
for
instance,
go
straight
to
the
secretary
at
that
point,
having
paid
the
tax,
and
ask
the
secretary
to
entertain
a
reasonableness
challenge.
if
the
secretary
finds
that
he
has
the
authority
to
do
that
and
that
the
fees
are
unreasonable,
then
we
think
the
secretary
would
have
the
authority
to
issue
affirmative
relief
at
that
point
to
the
airport
authority
requiring
a
refund
of
those
fees.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
as
you
said
before,
your
honor,
that
issue
is
fairly
joined.
we
don't
agree
that
this
would
expand
the
relief
granted
below
in
any
way.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
crash,
fire,
and
rescue
costs
had
been
unreasonably
allocated,
and
it
remanded
to
the
court...
the
district
court
to
determine
a
reasonable
allocation.
the
respondents
have
not
challenged
that,
so
when
this
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
can
assess
a
reasonable
allocation
of
costs
for
those
particular
fees,
and
that
will
control.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
remand
has
not
been
challenged
as
it
relates
to
crash,
fire,
and
rescue
costs.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the...
because
there
was
no
cross-petition
filed
on
that
particular
issue.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true,
your
honor.
although
the
decision
that
there
was
no
prior
right
of
action
would
undercut
the
logical
basis
for
the
remand,
the
remand
would
remain
the
law
of
the
case
because
it
has
not
been
challenged
in
this
court,
and
the
court
decision
would
only
affect
the
fact
that
no
other
issues
could
be
resolved
on
remand
in
the
district
court.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
assuming
the
parties
are
not
able
to
resolve
that
issue
amicably
in
light
of
this
court's
decision,
it
would
go
back
for
remand
on
that
one
particular
issue.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
don't
think
so,
again,
your
honor.
we
think,
for
perhaps
the
same
reasons
that
this
issue
cannot
be
raised
no
matter
whether
it
was
raised
below
or
not,
simply
because
it's
jurisdictional,
for
those
same
reasons
the
jurisdictional
question
would
not
control,
and
although
this
court's
decision
would
remove
the
rest
of
the
district
court's
authority
with
respect
to
the
case,
that
particular
remand
which
was
not
challenged
would
remain
in
the
district
court
and
could
be
resolved
as
a
matter
of
law
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
not
aware
of
a
formal
proceeding
that
has
been
brought
under
the
aaia
on
that
issue.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
there
is
no
decisional
law
on
that
issue.
there
is
administrative
law
in
the
sense
that
the
faa
has
issued
an
order
under
the
aaia,
among
other
statutes,
providing,
among
other
things,
for
standards
for
reasonableness
for
airport
user
fees,
and
that
authority,
that
order,
does
talk
about--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
unlimited
accumulation
of
surpluses.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
i
believe
most
of
those
issues
are
resolved
on
an
informal
level.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
before
the
money
is
delivered,
or
without
the
necessity
to
resort
to
a
former
adversarial
proceeding
before
the
secretary.
because
none
of
the
statutes
involved
here
confers
an
explicit
private
right,
we
have
to
look
to
congress'
intent,
and
it
is
the
petitioner's
burden
to
persuade
the
court
that
congress,
with
the
single
word
1513(b),
whose
major
function,
after
all,
is
merely
to
make
clear
that
the
head-tax
prohibition
of
section
1513(a)
does
not
apply
to
user
fees,
petitioners
must
rely
on
that
one
word
"reasonable"
to
engage
the
district
courts
all
over
the
country
in
what
is
essentially
a
ratemaking
proceeding,
and
we
think
that
quite
clearly
contravenes
the
intent
of
congress
in
placing
the
anti-head-tax
act
in
the
federal
aviation
act,
which
provides
quite
a
comprehensive
remedial
scheme.
in
the
faa,
section
1354,
which
is
reprinted
on
page
6a
of
our
brief,
provides
broad
general
powers
to
the
secretary,
section
1482
makes
it
clear
that
any
person
may
file
a
complaint
raising
any
sort
of
issue
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
faa...
i
might
point
out,
for
instance,
that
my
colleague,
mr.
smith,
on
behalf
of
many
of
the
same
airlines
who
are
involved
in
this
proceeding,
has
filed
such
a
complaint
last
wednesday
with
respect
to
los
angeles
airports,
again
raising
claims
under
the
aaia...
thank
you,
your
honor.
