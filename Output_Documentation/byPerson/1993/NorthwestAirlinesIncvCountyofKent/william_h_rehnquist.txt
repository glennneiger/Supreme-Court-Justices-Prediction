chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
92-97,
northwest
airlines,
inc.,
versus
the
county
of
kent.
mr
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
the
private
right
of
action
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
one
of
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
evansville
was
dormant
commerce
clause,
and
certainly
your
principal
case
here
isn't
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
you
know,
we
have
a
section
of
the
statute
here.
why
go
back
to
the
legislative
history?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
we
can
do
is
decide
this
case,
mr.
smith.
other
courts,
if
your
view
prevailed,
would
be
deciding
lots
of
other
cases,
and
we'd
have
the
indianapolis
airport
in
the
seventh
circuit
perhaps
coming
out
different
from
the
grand
rapids
airport
in
the
sixth
circuit.
at
least
if
it
went
to
the
secretary,
the
secretary
could
establish
a
uniform
system
for
the
whole
country,
or
the
same
machinery
would
be
applied
to
determine
reasonableness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
have
the
same
standards,
but
if
you
turn
them
over
to
93
different
district
courts
to
apply,
you're
probably
going
to
get
a
lot
more
differences
than
if
you
have
one
administrative
agency
applying
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
all
we're
talking
about
is
applying
the
evansville
standards.
well,
certainly
it
isn't
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
here
that
it
incorporated
the
evansville
standard.
all
it
uses
is
the
word
"reasonable".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
be
one
reason
why
we
should
decide
there
isn't
any
private
right
of
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
naturally.
are
you...
you
said
you
were
going
to
address
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
allege
in
your
commerce...
the
commerce
clause
section
of
your
complaint
that
the
general
aviation
was
intrastate
and
the
airport
was...
airlines
was
commercial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said,
did
you
allege
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
certainly
the...
i
don't
see
really
why
you're
entitled
to
a
remand
just
because
the
district
court
dismissed
your
complaint,
unless
you
brought
that
out
in
your
complaint.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
your
commerce
clause
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wasn't,
then,
as
you
understand
it,
a
dismissal
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
smith.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
we
were
to
say
there
is
no
private
right
of
action,
then
the
respondent
would
lose
the
benefit
of
the...
or
the
petitioner
would
lose
the
benefit
of
the
remand
on
that
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
we
were
to
say
there's
no
private
right
of
action,
nonetheless
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
deciding
the
proper
allocation
of
the
cfr
fees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
hunting,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hunting.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
four
cases
to
announce.
the
first
is
no.
92-97,
northwest
airlines
versus
the
county
of
kent,
michigan.
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
user
fees
charged
by
the
kent
county
that
is
grand
rapids,
michigan
airport
to
commercial
airlines.
the
airlines
contend
that
the
fees
are
unreasonable
and
discriminatory
under
a
federal
statute
called
the
anti-head
tax
act
and
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
they
say
that
the
airport
should
have
allocated
airfield
cost
to
the
concessions
at
the
airport
as
well
as
to
the
flight
operations
and
that
the
airport's
failure
to
charge
the
general
aviation
a
hundred
percent
of
its
allocated
cost
was
wrong.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
airlines
were
entitled
to
bring
a
private
action
under
the
act
but
rejected
the
airlines
challenge
to
the
fees
in
principal
part.
we
assumed
for
the
purposes
that
this
case
that
the
act
permits
the
airlines
to
commence
this
civil
action
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
absence
of
guidance
from
the
secretary
of
transportation
with
ministers
of
the
federal
aviation
laws,
we
apply
reasonable
standards
used
in
prior
cases.
under
these
standards
and
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
ginsburg,
we
conclude
that
the
fees
should
be
left
undisturbed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
