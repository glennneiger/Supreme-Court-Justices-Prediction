justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
does
the
secretary
have
the
authority
to
make
any
more
refined
or
precise
allocations
than
does
a
court
when
you
bring
an
action
before
the
court
rather
than
the
agency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
from
your
standpoint,
a
court
can
do
whatever
the
agency
can
do,
and
vice
versa,
in
this
area
of
allocating?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
point
of
my
question
is,
is
to
the
extent
the
court
thinks
that
what
you're
asking
for
is
simply
too
cumbersome
and
precise
for
courts
to
be
involved
in,
if
there's
an
equivalency,
then
it
follows
that
the
agency
can't
be
involved
in
it,
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when,
when
we
decide
the
adequacy
of
a
surplus
and
allocations
between
fuel
taxes
and
other
sorts
of
charges,
it
seems
to
me
that's
very
close
to
ratemaking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know
any
case
where
we
validate
a
discriminatory
tax,
discriminatory
as
to
out-of-state
participants,
on
the
ground
that
the
revenue
is
recovered
by
some
other
tax
that's
imposed
on
local
entities?
i
know
of
no
such
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
i'm
just
talking
to
that
straight
commerce
clause
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
compare
two
or
three
different
taxes
to
see
the
total
burden
on
all
of
the
participants?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
has
the
court--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--ever
entertained
an
analysis
of
a
whole
state's
tax
system
to
determine
the
burdens
imposed
upon
interstate
and...
in-state
and
out-of-state
participants?
no.
we
look
at...
simply
at
the
tax
on
its
face.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
is
valid
under
the
standard,
conventional
commerce
clause
analysis
if
you
show
a
discrimination
between
general
aviation
and
the
commercial
aviation,
but
when
you
then
have
the
concessions,
and
you
start
balancing
revenues,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
very
strange
dormant
commerce
clause
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
should
think
the
airlines
and
the
congress
would
be
quite
amazed
that
the
enactment
of
the
anti-head-tax
statute
took
away
a
federal
defense
in
state
courts.
