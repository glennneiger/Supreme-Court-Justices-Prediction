mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
precedent
of
this
court
that
mandates
that
a
local
governmental
unit
as
owner
and
landlord
must
lease
its
facilities
to
a
commercial
tenant
at
rates
that
are
less
than
the
acquisition
cost
of
the
facilities
so
provided.
likewise,
there
is
no
precedent
of
this
court
that
requires
an
airport
to
adjust
its
rates
to
one
tenant
based
upon
the
varying
business
results
of
yet
another
different
category
of
tenant.
the
traditional
fees
at
issue
in
this
case
are
very
simply
landing
fees
and
terminal
rental
rates,
which
clearly
are
permitted
under
the
clarification
language
of
section
1513(b)
of
the
anti-head-tax
act.
these
charges
being
landing
fees
and
terminal
rental
rates,
are
not
direct
or
indirect
taxes
or
illegal
fees
under
section
(a)
of
1513
of
the
anti-head-tax
act.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
they
are
not
at
issue,
and
if
i
could
explain
further--
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
--yes,
but
i
need
to
define
loss.
all
the
sixth
circuit
said
was,
it
was
inappropriate
to
allocate
100
percent
of
cfr
costs
to
the
commercial
airlines.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
we
did
not
appeal
that
decision.
we
do
expect,
depending
on
whether
the
remand
holds
up
and
whether
they're
amicable
proceedings
or
not,
to
litigate
before
the
district
judge
what
percent
less
than
100
percent
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
i
am
authorized
to
so
represent.
we
have
made
that
position
known
in
our
brief.
we
are
not
seeking
to
circumvent
the
rules
of
this
court
as
it
relates
to
needs
for
cross-petition,
and
in
particular
i
think
the
solicitor
general
in
the
footnote
on
page
8
of
its
brief
cited
a
number
of
cases
that
support
the
proposition
that
this
court
can
address
that
issue.
in
addition,
we
are
representing
that
we
are
not
going
to
interpose
any
affirmative
defense
if
the
court
were
to
so
rule
that
the
cfr
issue
would
not
then
be
before
the
district
court.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
i
believe
that
i
could
not
do
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
i
would
not--
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
--i
think
among
the
permutations
that
could
arise
from
the
unusual
circumstance
we
have,
that
could
be
one
of
the
permutations.
i
only
speak
for
what
i'm
authorized
to--
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
--in
that
event,
if
the
district
judge
were
to
abstain,
or
to
decline
to
take
the
case,
or
to
defer
it
to
the
agency,
under
any
one
of
those
somewhat
similar
scenarios
it
would
go
to
the
agency,
and
we
would
then
expect
to
abide
by
whatever
the
agency
decision
was
on
the
allocation
of
cfr
costs
that
are
imposed
under
faa
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
a
sense
that
all
the
sixth
circuit
decided
was
that
it
could
not
be
100
percent
allocation
to
the
commercial
airlines,
so
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
agency
would
at
least
be
bound
by
the
narrow
decision
and
the
law
of
the
case
as
it
relates
to
this
particular
action,
that
the
cfr
costs
could
not
in
fact
be
100-percent
allocated
to
the
commercial
airlines.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
we
recognize
that,
and
i--
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
--i
will
be
candid
to
acknowledge
that
it's
with
some
reluctance
that...
having
prevailed
at
the
lower
court
that
we've
raised
the
issue,
but
we
raised
the
issue
at
the
trial
court
level
dealing
with
the
private
cause
of
action
as
well
as
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
and
other
related
concepts
of
deference
to
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
we
did
not
cross-petition,
and
we
are
not
seeking
to
expand
relief
that
could
be
obtained
by
the
airport
or
relief
that
would
be
detrimental
to
the
airlines.
i
am
authorized
to
make
that
representation
to
the
extent
it's
relevant
to
the
court's
inquiry
on
what
might
happen.
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
three
bright
line
tests,
as
mr.
smith
has
called
them,
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause
test
in
the
evansville
case.
this
airport
does
not
retreat
from
any
kind
of
analysis
of
the
merits
of
its
methodology
and
the
results
of
its
methodology.
first,
the
charges
must
reflect
a
fair
approximation
of
the
use
of
the
airport
facilities
from
which
the
airlines
do
benefit.
in
very
simple
terms,
it
would
appear
that
could
mean
one,
two,
or
three
things,
either
that
the
user
charged
must
receive
some
benefit
from
the
item
for
which
the
user
is
charged.
we
certainly
pass
that
test,
and
to
the
extent
that
is
a
subpart,
we
agree.
to
the
extent
that
the
benefit
may
mean
that
an
airport
cannot
goldplate
its
facilities...
for
instance,
to
have
vermont
marble
on
the
ticket
countertops
or
oriental
rugs
on
the
floor,
we
agree
that
benefit
can
mean
that.
what
we
would
suggest
that
is
the
critical
issue
in
this
case,
whether
it
be
viewed
under
the
evansville
standard
or
any
other
standard,
is
a
serious
warping
by
the
airlines
of
what
benefit
means
when
they
suggest
that
somehow
an
airport
in
determining
its
charges
to
one
tenant
must
look,
either
by
cross-credit
or
by
change
in
cost
allocation
to
the
varying
benefit
that
yet
a
different
category
of
tenant
might
receive
from
its
business
results.
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
precedent
of
this
court
in
any
airport
or
other
local
governmental
setting
that
would
require
that
a
local
government
as
owner
and
landlord
engage
in
such
an
evaluation
of
benefits.
with
reference
to
benefits,
i
would
point
out
very
simply
that
the
district
court
found
in
unchallenged
fashion
that
the
totality
of
all
airport
charges,
including
the
reduced
overnight
aircraft
parking
fee
and
including
100
percent
of
cfr,
constituted
only
1-1/2
percent
of
the
gross
revenues
received
by
the
airlines
at
this
particular
airport.
the
second,
and
i
think
the
simplest
of
the
so-called
evansville
bright
line
tests,
are
that
the
airport
charges
may
not
be
excessive
in
relation
to
incurred
costs.
in
that
regard,
i
would
point
out
that
the
district
court
found
as
a
specific
critical
finding
of
fact
that
only
break-even
costs
as
defined
under
the
methodology
and
as
shown
under
the
evidence
were
charged
to
the
airlines
and
as
such
i
think
that
automatically
satisfies
the
second
charge.
and
certainly
i
would
indicate
further
that
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
there
is
a
reasonable
latitude
even
above
the
incurrence
and
the
allocation
of
actual
costs
and
clearly
that
has
been
satisfied
in
this
case.
the
third
criteria
of
evansville
is
that
the
charge
does
not
discriminate
against
interstate
travel,
and
i
would
point
out
first
that
general
aviation
and
the
airlines
are
not
in
the
same
category
of
tenant
under
the
airport
and
airway
improvement
act
or
under
any
other
analysis
that
might
be
applied.
they
do
not,
in
fact,
compete,
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
they
compete.
i
would--
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
--there
are
several
reasons.
the
economy
of
collection,
which
is
a
quotation
from
a
portion
of
the
airport
and
airway
improvement
act,
certainly
indicates
that
as
to
general
aviation
flights
that
are
unscheduled
it
is
very
difficult,
when
they
land
without
prior
notice
at
an
airport
such
as
ours,
to
be
able
to
apply
a
standard
landing
fee,
and
then
to
have
a
separate
billing
and
to
know
where
that
billing
should
be
sent.
and
consequently
this
airport
and,
as
the
testimony
indicates,
other
airports
have
gone
to
different
means,
which
traditionally
have
included
hangar
fees,
tie-down
charges,
and
more
often,
also
in
accordance
with
the
airport
and
airway
improvement
act,
so-called
fuel
flowage
charges
on
the
gasoline
sold
by
a
local
airport
to
those
general
aviation
entities
who
may
land
there,
or
land
there
and
stay
there,
and
it
is
in
that
respect
that
the
airport
has
chosen
to
approach
the
collection.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
no.
i'm
saying
that
with
the
commercial
airlines,
at
this
airport
and
most
airports,
there
are
predicted
scheduled
flights.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
with
general
aviation,
there
is...
these
are
not
scheduled
landings.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
so
it
is--
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
--the
tower
knows.
it
has
been
determined
by
this
and
many
airports
to
be
more
difficult
to
use
a
pure
landing
fee
as
the
only
mechanism
by
which
to
collect
appropriate
charges.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
impossible.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
it's
any
intentional
decision
to
prefer
this
particular
category.
i
think
it
is
a
reflection
of
practices
that
have
prevailed
here
and
elsewhere.
it
is
an
economy
of
collection
situation.
i
think
that
what
i
think
is
perhaps
more
relevant
on
the
general
aviation
issue
is
that
they
are
not
in
the
same
category.
they
do
not
compete.
the
airport
does
not
in
any
way
financially
impact
the
commercial
airlines
by
virtue
of
this
practice.
the
concession
revenues,
which
are
not
covered
by
the
anti-head-tax
act,
are
used
to
cover
the
so-called
shortfall
as
that
term
has
been
used
here.
concession
fees
are
not
under
the
airport...
excuse
me,
under
the
anti-head-tax
act,
and
when
you
couple
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
airline
charges
did
not
in
any
way
contribute
to
the
surplus,
i
think
that
this
becomes
more
of
what
the
court
properly
recognized
as
a
lack
of
standing
issue
than
as
the
airlines
have
characterized
it.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
no,
he
does--
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
--he
does
not
concede
that,
no,
and
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
he
did.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
anti-head-tax
act
in
its
legislative
history
demonstrated
no
indication
that
concession
revenues
should
at
all
be
addressed
by
that
statute.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
in
fact
congress
was
aware
that
certain
airports
were
in
fact
generating
profits
or
accumulating
surpluses.
i
think
the
bottom-line
analysis
when
looking
at
the
statutes
and
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
chose
to
regulate
the
mandatory
air
side
aspects
of
an
airport
and
chose
not
to
regulate
the
discretionary
purchase
concession
side
of
the
airports.
that's
a
decision
that
congress
has
made.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
we...
it
could
be
considered
a
charge
on
the
persons
traveling.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
covered
by
the
anti-head-tax
act.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
it
would
not--
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
--directly
or
indirectly.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
i...
there
certainly
could
be
a
mandatory
aspect
of
the
question
you
ask,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
charge
for
that
facility
is
covered
by
the
anti-head-tax
act,
and
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
perhaps
the
simplest
analysis
of
whether
concessions
are
included
in
section
1513(a)
of
the
anti-head-tax
act
is
to
analyze
the
argument
of
the
airlines.
they
claim
concessions
are
included
in
section
(a),
and
they
claim
that
section
(b)
is
a
so-called
savings
clause.
if
both
of
those
premises
are
true,
it
is
clear
that
section
1513(b)
did
not
save
concession
charges
as
being
illegal
under
1513(a),
which
would
leave
you
with
the
absurd
and
i
think
illogical
result
that
all
concession
charges
at
the
airport
would
be
illegal,
and
i
suggest
that
that
simple
analysis
is
perhaps
the
easiest
way
to
approach
the
very
important
issue
here
as
to
whether
concession
revenues
are
at
all
addressed
by
or
regulated
by
the
anti-head-tax
act.
and
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
such
regulation,
that
congress
has
simply
chosen
to
regulate
the
mandatory
side
of
airports
through,
initially,
the
airport
and
airway
improvement
act,
and
secondarily,
the
anti-head-tax
act,
certainly
in
indicating
by
clarifying
language
that
these
types
of
charges
are
to
be
permitted.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
i
would
suggest
something
that
i
think
is
outside
the
record,
but
yet
i
think
is
certainly
known,
and
that
is
that
in
many
instances
with
other
airports
there
have
been
leases
that
could
be
of
duration,
10,
20,
or
30
years,
so
that
these
charges
have
been
established
in
one
form
or
another
by
negotiated
leases
that
cover
long
periods
of
time.
consequently,
much
of
the
period
of
time
that
would
have
been
taken
care
of
in
the
seventies
and
eighties
were,
i
think,
at
many
airports
covered
by
leases
of
very
long
duration,
and
i
think
that
to
that
extent
the
issue
is
now
percolating
i
think
to
a
greater
extent
than
it
has
before.
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
the
very
complex
situation
of
the
massport
case
that
the
agency
in
fact
did
choose
to
entertain
a
complaint
by
a
general
aviation
entity,
chose
to
intervene
in
the
other
proceedings,
and
continued
with
an
active
role
throughout
all
of
that,
and
it
was
in
fact
the
massport
proceeding
that
caused
this
airport
to
raise
the
affirmative
defenses
when
it
did
in
late
december
of
'89
and
early
january
of
1990.
and
if
i
could
address
i
think
several
questions
that
came
from
the
court,
the
dismissal
by
district
court
judge
bell
of
the
interstate
commerce
case
was
not
solely
on
issues
of
law.
i
hesitate
to
be
before
this
court
and
talking
about
answers
to
interrogatories
and
discovery,
but
the
airport
filed
a
combined
motion
under
rule
56
for
summary
judgment
and
12(b)(6),
and
for
the
combined
reasons
of
no
factual
proofs
either
to
support
an
interstate
commerce
claim
or,
perhaps
more
importantly,
to
distinguish
that
claim
from
an
airport
and
airway
improvement
act
claim,
or
an
anti-head-tax
act
claim,
relying
on
that
absence
of
factual
proof
and
the
rationale
of
the
merrion
case,
the
district
court
so
ruled.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
sixth
circuit
observed
the
nature
of
that
ruling
on
pages
30
and
31
of
its
opinion,
commenting
that
there
was
a
factual
aspect
and
lack
of
proof
as
well
as
to
legal,
and
we
stand
here
today,
even
without
the
absence
of
proof
that
in
my
judgment
would
indicate
any
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
i
am.
those
records
exist
in
the
faa
tower
independent
of
discovery
directed
to
the
airport.
the
ruling
by
district
court
judge
bell
was
in
an
opinion
in
the
middle
of
january
1990.
we
went
to
trial
february
12,
1990.
that
opinion
was
on
the
eve
of
trial,
after
considerable
opportunity
to
adduce
facts
that
would
distinguish
and/or
support
an
interstate
commerce
clause
claim,
so
i'm
suggesting
that
there
were
two
prongs,
or
two
aspects
of
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
as
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
sixth
circuit
noted
the
contentions
of
the
airport
on
page
30
and
31
of
its
opinion
in
that
regard.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
if
i
could
explain
to
you
specifically
what
we
have
done
in
our
instance,
i
would
hope
that
would
answer
you.
we
reached
a
stipulation
with
the
airlines,
filed
in
this
case
at
the
district
court
level,
that
would
make
the
payments
from
them
to
this
airport
subject
to
whatever
the
final
results
of
this
decision
is.
we
have
a
judgment
supported
by
bonds
for
the
difference
between
the
old
rates
and
the
new
rates
from
april
1,
1988
to
the
end
of
1989,
which
was
the
end
of
the
period
of
time
covered.
in
addition,
we
have
a
stipulation
that
would
make
the
results
of
any
cfr
allocation,
and/or
any
decision
of
this
court
would
be
taken
into
account
quantitatively
by
virtue
of
that
stipulation.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
we
are
saying
that
the
resort
in
the
first
instance
for
the
airlines,
if
they
are
to
challenge
reasonableness,
is
to
go
to
the
agency.
the
second
question
which
i
think
you
were
positing
to
me
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
position
would
be
airport
take
about
the
interim
usage
of
the
airport
during
the
period
of
time
that
a
reasonableness
dispute
might
be
existing,
i
would
hope
that
we
would,
if
such
a
situation
again
arose,
reach
another
amicable
stipulation
as
we
did
at
the
trial
court
level.
mr.
william
f.
hunting,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
