justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
how
many
other
federal
statutes
are
there
that
confer
ratemaking
responsibilities
upon
federal
courts?
i
mean,
that
is
essentially
what
you're
asking
us
to
engage
in
here,
isn't
it,
the
whole
process
of
ratemaking?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
what
you're
entitled
to
are
reasonable
rates,
which
are
going
to
be
determined
by
federal
courts.
i
know
one
federal
statute
that
requires
that.
i
don't
know
any
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
allow
any
profit
in
your
assertion
of
reasonableness.
as
i
recall,
one
of
the
elements
you've
challenged
was
including
within
it
what
interest
payments
would
have
been
made
had
they
borrowed
the
money
in
order
to
provide
these
facilities.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
normal
ratemaking,
you're
allowed
a
fair
return
on
your
capital.
why
isn't
that
reasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
reason--
justice
antonin
scalia
he
already
decided
one
case,
at
least,
involving
the
reasonableness
of
fees,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
to
that,
even
your
statement
that
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
strengthening
the
evansville
standards,
i
mean,
that
leaves
a
lot
of
running
room.
you're
strengthening
standards
developed
for
dormant
commerce
clause
purposes.
strengthening
them
to
what
extent?
all
we
know
is
that
they
were
strengthen...
strengthening
them
to
what
extent?
to
the
extent
that
from
now
on
it's
going
to
have
to
be
reasonable...
not
just
enough
to
comply
with
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
but
reasonable...
and
it
seems
to
me
it
leaves
open
the
whole
field
of
ratemaking.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
are
you
going
to
say
something
about
private
right
of
access?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
very
interested
in
that.
as
i
understand
it,
your
point
is
that
if
we
reach
that
issue,
it's
apt...
and
the
respondent
is
normally
allowed
to
raise
any
issue
to
sustain
the
judgment
below...
you
say
it
would
expand
the
relief.
why
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
cfr
costs.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
item
to
which
it
would
expand
it.
they
assert
that
the
cfr
costs
have
already
been
assessed
and
that
whatever
happens
here
it
won't
make
any
difference
as
to
whether
you
get
that...
whether
you
get
that
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
true
or
false?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
issue's
fairly
well
joined.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
must
do
that,
or
just...
they'll
be
nice
guys
and
will
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
cases
in
which
state
courts
apply
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
a
federal
agency?
i
just
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not,
either.
so
at
least
it's
an
open
question
in
your
mind
as
to
whether
or
not,
in
a
state
court
action,
the
anti-head-tax
statute
is
valid
federal
defense.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dumont,
what's
your
response
to
the
assertion
that
none
of
this
is
properly
before
us
because
if
we
acknowledged
your
contention
we
would
expand
the
relief
below
and
therefore
this
can't
be
entertained?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
remand
has
not
been
challenged?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
determine
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say,
mr.
hunting,
that
the
crash,
fire,
and
rescue
charges
are
not
at
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
agree
that
no
matter
what
happens
here,
you've
lost
on
that,
and
the
district
court
should,
on
remand,
decide
that
issue
as
though
there
is
a
private
right
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
will
not
interpose
the
absence
of
any
private
right
of
action
even
if
that
were
to
be
the
conclusion
of
this
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
further
represent
that
you
cannot
do
it,
even
if
you
wanted
to,
or
are
you
just
being
a
good
fellow?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
law
of
the
other
part
of
the
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith
doesn't
concede
that,
does
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
concession
fees
are
not
covered
by
the
ahta?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
how...
i
think
it's
a
good
argument,
frankly.
i'm
not
sure
it's
all
that
clear.
you
know,
whether
you're
going
to
have
something
to
eat
while
you're
waiting
for
a
plane,
how
discretionary
is
that?
suppose
the
airport,
you
know,
imposes
a
$20
charge
on
use
of
the
restrooms
in
the
airport?
would
that
not
be
covered
by
the
ahta?
that
would
not
be
considered
a
charge
on
the
persons
traveling?
i
think
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
really?
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
directly
or
indirectly?
justice
antonin
scalia
other
charge,
directly
or
indirectly?
and
you
think
that
that's
a
good
way
around
it...
just
really
hit
them
for
the
use
of
the
mens
room.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hunting,
i'm
perplexed
as
to
why
the
secretary
hasn't
gotten
involved
in
this
thing
more.
i
mean,
you
and
the
united
states
are
proposing
that
we
leave
all
this
to
the
secretary,
but
the
strange
phenomenon
is
that
the
secretary's
had
only
one
case
involving
this
legislation,
and
there
are
very
major
issues
such
as
the
one
we're
just
talking
about,
about
whether,
you
know,
concession
fees
are
included,
and
so
forth.
how
can
it
be
that
it's
really
his
bailiwick
and
yet
he
hasn't
done
anything?
