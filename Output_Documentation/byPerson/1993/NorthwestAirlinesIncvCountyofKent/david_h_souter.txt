--so
you'd
allow
depreciation,
would
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
depreciation
absolutely
necessary?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
can
they
retain
some
of
those
costs
for
future
construction?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
airport
is
saying
here,
you
know,
we're
facing
construction
fees
on
reasonable
projections
of...
you
know,
multiple
millions
of
dollars,
so
there's
nothing
for
example,
terribly
impressive
about
this
surplus
of
$9
million,
if
they
could
anticipate
future
expense
to
that
extent
in,
as
you
put
it,
recovering
their
costs.
why
is
it
wrong
for
them
simply
to,
in
effect,
put
the
same
amount
of
money
aside
calling
it
a
surplus?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
airport
needs
judged
at
what
point,
at
what
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
concede,
and
do
you
now
concede,
that
under
the
statute
the
distinction
between
burdens
on
intrastate
and
interstate
commerce
are
irrelevant...
is
irrelevant?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
airlines
refuse
to
pay
the
fees,
they
would
be
sued
in
court,
would
they
not?
in
other
words,
the
airport
authority
would
simply
take
them
into
a
state
or
conceivably
a
federal
court
to
collect
the
money?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
there's
no
way
to
insulate
these
issues
from
court
review.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
grant
you
that,
but
just
in
sort
of
making
the
calculus
of
what
congress
might
have
assumed,
congress
certainly
did...
presumably
started
with
the
assumption
that
there
was
at
least
some
circumstances
in
which
these
issues
would
be
litigated
as
between
private
parties
and
in
the
kind
of
action
that
we've
got
here,
except
that
it
would
be
brought
by
the
airport
on
the
airlines'
refusal
to
pay.
