weren't
those
surpluses
generated
by
payments
from
the
concessioners,
not
from
the
airline?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
all
was,
basically.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
the
reason
they
have
a
surplus
is
the
payments
from
the
concessioners.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
it
true
that
under--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
the
federal
law,
whatever
surplus
is
there
can
only
be
used
for
airport
purposes,
it
can't
be
diverted
to
general
state
coffers?
justice
sandra

o'connor
now,
evansville
was
a
dormant
commerce
clause
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
the
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis
means
that
you
achieve
this
result?
there
can't
be
a
surplus?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
strikes
me
as
a
very
tough
argument
to
make.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
smith,
now,
you
could...
your
client
could
have
gone
the
administrative
route,
i
guess,
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
make
its
complaints
about
these
charges.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
any
event,
no
effort
was
made
here
to
go
administratively.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
may
have
been
an
erroneous
approach
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
what
other
examples
can
you
think
of
where
in
a
dormant
commerce
clause
we
decided
we
have
to
get
into
reasonableness
of
rates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
the
court
looking
more
at
whether
there's
a
discrimination
or
an
excessive
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
isn't
that
the
focus?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
were
to
decide
this,
that
there's
no
private
cause
of
action,
is
that
jurisdictional,
then,
for
the
district
court?
would
we
be
saying
there
was
no
jurisdiction
there
at
all?
