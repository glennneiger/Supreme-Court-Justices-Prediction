where
does
evansville
say
you
can't
have
surpluses?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
using
a
case
that
was...
in
which
the
airport
succeeded
in
retaining
its
charges,
right?
wasn't
that
the
case
in
evansville?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
airport
won
the
case,
and
you're
using
that
case
to
say,
but
in
this
case
the
airport
loses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
said,
no
head
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
i'd
like
you
to
back
up
on
one
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
do
you
equate
general
aviation
with
intrastate
commerce
and
commercial
with
inter?
what
in
the
record
supports...
i
know
you
get
it
from
a
decision
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
made
this
comment
offhand,
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
this
record
that
tells
us
that
the
general
aviation
category
is
intrastate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
agency
then...
the
agency
would
not
be
precluded
by
what
the
sixth
circuit
determined
in
this
case,
would
it?
it
would
just
be
a
fresh
matter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
apart
from
that,
is
there
a
reason
why
the
break
was
given
to
general
aviation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying--
--it's
done
in
a
lot
of
airports.
--then
it's
just
administrative
convenience,
as
opposed
to
a
decision
that
this
category
of
transportation
should
be
preferred?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
then
taking
issue
with
mr.
smith,
who
said
because
it
was
cut
off
so
early
in
the
district
court
they
didn't
have
a
chance
to
show
that
general
aviation
coincides
with
intrastate
traffic?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
your
position
that
the
airlines
can't
be
in
a
deficiency
position
coming
to
court,
that
they
have
to
pay
and
complain
later,
is
that...
it's
only
a
refund
that
they
can
get.
suppose
they're
sued
in
a
state
or
federal
court?
they
have
to
pay
up,
and
then
they
can
seek
a
refund?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean
for
the
future.
your
position
is
that
there
is
no
lawsuit
that
the
airlines
can
institute.
they
must
either
be
in
a
defensive
posture,
resisting
a
suit
for
them
to
pay,
or
they
can
go
to
the
faa,
or
they
can
go
to
the
department
of
transportation,
but
they
can't...
they
can't
come
to
court
as
a
plaintiff.
