ms.
amy
l.
wax
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
petitioner
tries
hard
to
complicate
this
case,
at
bottom
its
resolution
requires
answering
two
straightforward
questions.
the
first
is
whether
the
secretary's
reimbursement
rule
for
education
costs
as
embodied
in
this
regulation
at
issue
is
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
secretary's
authority
to
determine
reasonable
costs
of
medical
care
to
patients
that
will
be
paid
by
the
medicare
program.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
secretary's
rule
is
an
unreasonable
construction
of
the
terms
of
the
regulation
itself
under
this
court's
deference
rules
in
chevron
and
udall
v.
tallman.
the
united
states
submits
that
both
of
these
questions
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
secretary.
the
secretary's
rule
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
rule
in
light
of
the
text
and
purpose
of
the
medicare
act.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
would
depend
on
whether
that
institution
was
an
affiliated
institution.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
oh,
i
see
what
you're
saying.
you're
giving
me
a
hypothetical--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--of
a
different
institution.
yes.
the
rule
is
that
if...
when
a
cost
is
first
incurred
by
an
institution,
if
that
institution
comes
to
medicare
and
says
we
don't
have,
obviously,
an
established
source
of
funding
since
this
is
the
first
time
that
we've
taken
on
these
new
responsibilities,
we
want
you
to
help
us
pay
for
them,
then
yes,
the
community
support
and
redistribution
rule
would
allow
medicare
to
pay
those
costs.
if
the
institution
didn't
claim
them,
they
found
some
other
source
of
funding,
then
they
lose
that
claim
forever.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
the
statute
creates
an
insurance
program
to
pay
for
medical
services
and
medicare
care
provided
directly
to
patients.
its
purpose
is
not
to
promote
and
support
medical
education.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
rely
upon
the
definition,
which
is
a
very
broad
definition,
of
reasonable
costs,
or
the
phrase,
reasonable
costs
of
medical
care
to
patients.
now,
the
secretary
has
made
a
judgment,
and
he
could...
she
could
have
made
a
different
judgment.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that
medical
education--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
we
have
to
distinguish
between
the
services
that
interns
and
residents
provide
to
patients,
the
actual
care
they
give,
okay.
physicians'
services
are
not
reimbursed
under
part
a
of
medicare,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case.
they
are
reimbursed
under
part
b,
and
under
part
b,
there's
no
separate
allocation
for
intern
and
resident
services,
but
what
there
is
is
there's
an
allocation
for
the
attending
physician,
the
physician
in
charge.
every
time
he
sees
the
patient,
every
time
he
signs
the
chart,
medicare
is
charged.
folded
within
that
charge
is
his
supervisory
tasks
of
the
team
of
apprentices
and
assistants
that
help
him.
those
are
part
b
costs.
so
you're
right,
justice
scalia,
we
are
not
charging
medicare...
medicare
is
not
being
charged
for
the
services
that
these
trainees
render.
this
is
something
different.
this
is
the
enhanced
quality
of
care
in
an
institution
that
results
from
having
an
education
or
training
program
on
the
premises.
it's
vague.
it's
a
kind
of
secondary
atmospheric
effect.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
it's
the
effect
of
having
a
teaching
program
with
the
scholarly
atmosphere,
the
extra
scrutiny,
the
extra
oversight.
it's
those
sorts
of
benefits
of
having
an
education
program
on
the
premises,
and
not
the
direct
services
that
the
interns
are
providing,
which
is
a
part
b
cost.
that's
how
we
conceptualize
it.
now,
the
secretary
has
made
a
judgment
that
it's
a
good
thing
overall
to
have
a
training
program,
although
it's
not
essential.
petitioner
is
simply
wrong
that
the
presence
of
interns
and
residents
is
essential
to
the
efficient
delivery
of
medical
care,
because
it
isn't.
80
percent
of
hospitals
have
no
interns
and
residents.
they
do
a
perfectly
good
job
of
taking
care
of
patients.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
well,
it
is
true
that
congress
did
refer
to
them
in
the
definitional
section.
the
way
medicare
actually
works
that
is
that
we
fold
them
into
the
part
b
charges.
to
the
extent
that
that
definition
implies
that
there
ought
to
be
some
sort
of
reimbursement
for
intern
and
resident
costs
as
hospital
services,
which
is
a
matter
of
classification,
we
do
provide
some,
because
the
secretary
has
a
rule
that
under
certain
circumstances
she
will
pay
some
share
of
the
costs
of
maintaining
these
programs.
not
under
all
circumstances.
if
there's
private
support
that's
sufficient,
and
there's
a
track
record
of
private
support,
the
secretary
is
not
going
to
come
in
and
supplant
that
support
or
compensate
for
its
withdrawal,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is,
is
that
an
abuse
of
the
secretary's
discretion,
or
is
that
a
reasonable,
legitimate
rule
that
accomplishes
a
number
of
legitimate
purposes
in
supporting
an
educational
program?
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
the
regulation
has
been
on
the
books
since
1966,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
your
honor,
it's
difficult
to
answer
that
question
for
the
following
reason.
when
a
hospital
or
provider
incurs
costs,
it
goes
to
the
intermediary,
which
is
an
insurance
carrier
that
contracts
with
the
secretary,
and
it
submits
a
cost
report.
it
makes
a
request
for
reimbursement,
and
the
intermediary
is
the
first
entity
that
interprets
and
applies
the
secretary's
regulations.
now,
as
long
as
the
intermediary
is
allowing
costs,
and
the
provider
is
happy,
we
assume
that
the
intermediary
has
been
applying
those
regulations
correctly
since
they
were
implemented,
and
the
secretary
isn't
going
to
know
about
any
problems
unless
there's
been
a
denial
of
costs
and
the
provider
appeals
and
is
dissatisfied.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
that
seems
to
be
what
happened
in
'84.
what
happened
in
'84
is
that
the
intermediary
in
this
case
was
kind
of
caught
off
guard.
we're
not
saying
there
are
never
any
mistakes
made
by
intermediaries.
we
acknowledge
that
the
intermediary
made
a
mistake
in
1984
in
this
case
and
we
didn't
catch
it
until
this
litigation
came
before
the
administrator
and
allowed
the
costs.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
that's
right,
but
then
when
it
appealed
to
the
administrator,
the
administrator
said
no,
intermediary,
you
should
not
have
allowed
these
costs,
but
it's
too
late,
because
the
reopening
period
has
lapsed,
so
we
have
to...
i
mean,
there
is
closure
for
some
of
these
cost
reports,
and
there
was
closure
for
the
'84
cost
report.
but
the
point
is,
justice
ginsburg,
that
we're
assuming
that
everything
was
cooking
along
from
1966
until
'84,
and
that
this
regulation
was
pretty
much
being
complied
with
by
the
medical
schools
and
the
intermediaries,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
in
1985,
everything
changed.
first
of
all,
the
prospective
payment
system
was
put
in
place,
which
put
a
very
severe
limit
on
the
reimbursing
available
for
ordinary
medical
services,
and
this
created
tremendous
financial
pressure
on
the
hospitals
and
on
the
medical
schools
to
find
alternative
sources
of
funding.
but
medical
education
was
still
being
reimbursed
on
a
reasonable
cost
basis
up
through
the
base
year
in
1985,
so
there
was...
and
other
sources
of
funding
were
drying
up,
costs
were
rising.
basically
the
costs
and
the
sources
of
funding
were
on
a
collision
course
with
each
other,
so
medical
schools
started
to
bring
in
accounting
firms
to
audit
their
books
and
try
and
ferret
out
new
costs
that
could
be
shifted
to
medicare
under
the
rubric
of
education
costs.
now,
this
is
precisely
what
congress
didn't
want
to
have
happen.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
is...
it
is...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
redistribution
rule
is
a
johnny-come-lately
rule,
so
to
speak.
it's
a
use-it-or-lose-it
rule,
but
it
specifically
applies
to
related
educational
entities.
this
regulation
really
has
two
parts.
it
has
a
broader
community
support
principle
which
would
apply
not
just
to
medical
schools
but
actually
to
the
provider
itself.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
if
you're
asking
me
why
that
position
wasn't
taken
initially
for
this
medical
school,
that
we
didn't
allow
a
shift
in
costs--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
first
of
all,
it
was
applied
from
day
1
for
the
particular
costs
being
claimed
that
are
the
subject
of
this
case,
okay...
it
is.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
okay...
well,
the
costs
that
we
say
are
allowable
and
that
were
found
to
be
allowable
were
costs
that
provider
had
been
claiming
all
along,
even
though
they
were
incurred
by
the
medical
school.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
okay,
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that's
a
different
issue,
and
there
the
question
is,
was
what
happened
in
1974,
was
it
consistent
with
this
antiredistribution
and
community
support
principle?
in
other
words,
in
1973--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--redistribution--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--because
we
don't
know,
because
we
don't
have
it
in
the
record,
what
exactly
the
costs
were
that
they
were
claiming
in
'74,
and
let
me
give
you
an
example.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
don't
know
whether
they
claimed
them
prior
to
'74.
i
mean,
we
don't
know
whether
they
incurred
them
prior
to
'74.
that's
the
answer.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
if
they
had
been
costs
of
the
medical
school.
they
might
have
been
costs
of
the
provider.
we
don't
know
what
the
allocation
was
between
the
medical
school
and
the
provider.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
essentially
our
answer,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
fact
is--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--intermediary.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that
could
be
the
answer,
too,
for
all
we
know.
i
mean,
we
assume
that...
we
want
to
assume,
and
we
do
as
a
general
matter
assume
that
the
intermediary
has
applied
the
regulation
correctly,
and
we
assume
that
the
providers
and
the
medical
schools
can
read
the
regulation,
too,
but
the
fact
is
that
whether
this
was
a
mistake,
or
whether
it
was
a
matter
of
new
costs,
you
have
to
realize
that
the
amount
expended
by
an
institution
on
programs
doesn't
stay
constant
from
year
to
year.
a
tremendous
expansion
and
upgrading
of
these
programs
was
taking
place
from
the
mid-1960's
all
the
way
through
the
nineties.
there
was
a
huge
burgeoning
of
new
programs,
new
expenditures
on
old
programs,
and
for
all
we
know
between
'73
and
'74,
thomas
jefferson
could
have
doubled
the
number
of
residents,
tripled
the
number
of
faculty,
increased
its
resident
salaries...
all
of
these
things
were
happening
at
the
time
in
schools
all
across
the
country.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
they
are
each
independently
sufficient,
your
honor,
so
that
this
court
could
agree
with
us,
and
we
think
they
should,
on
our
reading
of
the
very
explicit
language
of
the
redistribution
clause.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right,
the
last
sentence
of
the
regulation,
which
says--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
no,
we
think
that's
clear
as
well,
but
the
point
about
the
redistribution
provision
is
that
it's
a
narrower
provision
that
specifically
applies
to
this
case,
and
this
circumstance
of
a
medical
school,
an
educational
unit
taking
over
costs.
the
community
support
principle,
although
it
tracks
in
every
respect
the
effect
of
the
redistribution
clause,
is
a
broader
principle,
and
that
in
itself
is
also
sufficient
to
get
the
result
in
this
case,
and
they
both
have
the
same
effect,
which
is
that
if
there's
a
level
of
community
support
that's
been
established,
established
by
the
institution
not
going
to
medicare
and
claiming
costs,
then
medicare
will
presume
that
there's
community
support.
it
will
not
pay
those
costs
in
the
future...
it's
a
one-way
ratchet...
and
of
course
it
will
not
pay
those
costs
even
if
there
is
a
withdrawal
of
support,
because
that
would
be
a
redistribution
to
medicare,
and
that
is
also
forbidden
by
the
plain
terms
of
the
regulation,
and
also,
we
think,
contrary
to
congress'
intent
as
it
is
expressed
in
the
aha
rules
and
in
the
legislative
history.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
they're
not...
we
don't
think
that
they're
arbitrary
factors,
or
that
they're
irrelevant.
the
fact
is
that
some
institutions
have
an
easier
time
getting
private
and
public
sources
of
support.
i
mean,
it's
easier
for
harvard
medical
school
to
get
some
rich
and
charitable
person
to
pay
their
costs
than
it
is
for
maybe
ohio
state
to...
that's
just
a
fact
of
life,
but--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
well,
the
fact
is
that
one
may
have
been
sleeping,
the
other
may
have
been
alert,
but
the
one
that
was
sleeping
was
paying
its
costs
somehow.
the
fact
is,
it
was
incurring
those
costs,
it
was
employing
interns
and
residents,
it
was
employing
faculty,
faculty
to
educate
those
interns
and
residents.
somebody
was
paying
for
it,
and
the
assumption
is
that
if
we
weren't
paying
for
it,
if
medicare
wasn't
paying
for
it,
it
was
being
paid
for
by
some
private,
eleemosynary
source,
like
grants.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
we
are
saying...
we're
not
saying
that
we
could
have
the
same
rule
for
blood
transfusions
or
for
antibiotic
therapy.
we're
not
saying
that.
we
rely
very
heavily
on
the
fact
that
these
sorts
of
costs
are
at
the
margins
of
what
the
medicare
program
is
designed
to
accomplish.
this
is
where
the
secretary's
discretion
is
at
its
greatest,
deciding
where
that
line
is
going
to
be
drawn.
we
don't
think
that
the
secretary
has
the
same
obligation
to
pay
medical
education
costs
that
she
might
have
to
pay
costs
of
something
that
lies
at
the
core
of
medical
care
and
medical
services,
of
what
we
understand
a
medical
insurance
program
to
cover.
private
insurance
doesn't
cover
medical
education.
now,
blue--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--for
this
kind
of
expense,
yes,
because
of
the
kind
of
expense
it
is,
for
the
very
reasons
that
justice
scalia
pointed
out
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
these
are
the
kinds
of
services
which
arguably
enhance
the
quality
of
patient
care,
but
there's
also
an
argument
on
the
other
side
that
they
don't.
i
mean,
the
fact
is
anybody
who
has
been
in
a
university
hospital
as
opposed
to
a
private
hospital
knows
that
having
interns
or
residents
is
a
mixed
bag.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
first
of
all,
the
secretary--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
first
of
all
she's
interpreting
the
words
of
1395x(v)(1)(a).
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right,
page
61a
of
the
pet
app.--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
it's
42
u.s.c.
section
1395x
(v)(1)(a).
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
and
there,
the
secretary...
it
says
the
reasonable
costs
of
services
shall
be
the
costs
incurred,
and
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
regulations
establishing
the
method
or
methods
to
be
used
and
the
items
to
be
included
in
determining
such
costs
for
various
institutions
and
services.
now,
we
read
that
as
essentially...
and
then
there
is
another
statute,
1395hh,
which
is
not
in
the
appendix,
which
says
that
the
secretary
has
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
to
implement--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--the
authority
under
this
section.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right,
and
the--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--what
is
a
reasonable--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
it's
not
irrelevant
to
whether
it's
reasonable
to
pay
it,
for
the
following
reason.
the
secretary
is
trying
to...
essentially
to
reconcile
a
number
of
competing
goals,
and
one
of
the
goals
is
the
goals
expressed
in
the
legislative
report,
for
better
or
worse,
to
promote,
to
encourage
the
community
to
pay
these
education
costs,
okay.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
with
all
due
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
we
can't
forget
about
the
community,
because
the
point
of
the
redistribution
clause
is
that
the
medical
school
and
its
donors
is
part
of
the
community.
that's
what
makes
sense
of
the
redistribution
clause
and
the
community
support.
it's...
the
redistribution
clause
implements
the
community
support
idea,
which
is--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that's
not
entirely
correct.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
hospital
fees,
the
amounts
that
patients
pay
out
of
pocket
to
the
institution,
the
secretary
has
taken
the
position,
or
at
least
currently
takes
the
position
that
that
would
not
be
community
support,
so
you
could
rebut
the
presumption
of
community
support.
you
could
rebut
it.
the
presumption
is
raised
by
not
charging
medicare,
but
the
provider,
the
hospital
could
rebut
the
presumption
by
showing
either
that
it
ran
a
deficit
hat
was
tied
to
their
program,
or
that
the
money
was
not
coming
from
the
usual
state
and
charitable
sources,
but
out
of
the
pocket
of
patients,
which
we
think
probably
congress
did
not
consider
community
support,
but
apart
from
that,
any
other
source
would
be
community
support.
so
to
get
back
to
justice
scalia's
point,
there
is
a
rational
policy
behind
this
one-way
ratchet,
this
rule,
which
is,
the
secretary
on
the
one
hand
wants
to
promote
and
not
discourage
community
support,
and
she
certainly
doesn't
want
to
come
in
and
supplant
and
displace
any
community
support
that's
already
in
place,
which
is
what
happened
if
she
came
in
and
paid
when
community
support
diminished.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
would
not
read
the
language
that
way.
i
mean,
it
implies,
we
think,
the
contrary,
which
is
that
the
secretary
can
make
rules
that
are
tailored
to
each
kind
of
institution.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
there's
teaching
hospitals,
there's
nonteaching
hospitals.
the
secretary--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we
still
think
this
language
accommodates.
we
don't
consider
it
discrimination,
but
we
consider
it--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
no.
we
only
say
that
we
don't
think
it's
irrational
and
unreasonable,
and
that's
the
standard,
for
the
secretary
to
have
a
rule
that
takes
into
account
the
willingness
of
private
sources
to
fund
an
institution,
because
we
don't
think
the
secretary--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
the
one
that
started
charging
earlier
charged
under
our
rules
for
a
new
program
which
entailed
new
financial--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
that's
not
necessarily
so.
an
institution...
you
know,
just
because
money
is
available
doesn't
mean
an
institution
has
to
claim
it.
an
institution
might
have
its
own
good
reasons
not
to
go
to
medicare
if
it's
got
a
generous
donor.
it
involves
red
tape,
you
have
to
comply
with
the
government's
rules--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--once
again,
your
honor,
somebody
paid
for
this,
and
the
secretary
finds
it
significant
that
somebody
paid
for
it.
the
secretary
fears
being
engulfed
with
a
huge
shifting
of
costs.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
how
could
the
secretary
assume
anything
else?
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
agree
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--it's
rather
anemic,
because
we
still
have
for
the
base
year,
and
the
base
year
carries
forward
to
the
future
forever,
we
still
have
a
reasonable
cost
regime,
which
will--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes,
well,
it's
not
a
very
effective
cap,
because
reasonable
cost
means
that
the
institution
gives
you
a
bill
for
what
it
actually
spent,
and
unless
the
secretary
can
show
that
that's
vastly
inflated,
the
secretary
has
to
pay
that.
that's
the
reasonable
cost
rule,
and
the
fact
is
that
if
we
don't
win
this
case
there's
going
to
be
a
massive
shifting
of
costs
that
medical
schools
and
institutions
have
previously
paid
for
by
other
means
into
the
base
year
amount
for
dozens
of
institutions,
and
the
bill
is
going
to
shoot
way
up.
that's
just
a
fact.
there's
going
to
be
a
massive
redistribution.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
depends
on
what
services
you're
talking
about.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
there's
a
separate
line...
there's
a
separate
provision
for
the
reimbursement
of
education
costs,
on
the
theory
that
that
enhances
care.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
