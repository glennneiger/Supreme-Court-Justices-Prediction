before
you
go
any
further,
may
i
ask
why
you
say
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
would
normally
be
allowable
costs?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
perhaps
under
the
regulation,
as
you
interpret
it,
but
what
provision
of
the
statute
allows
these
costs
to
be
charged...
to
be
reimbursed?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
costs
of
services
provided
to
the
patients,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
section
1395x(v)
defines
inpatient
hospital
services
to
include
services...
services
provided
in
a
hospital
by
an
intern
or
a
resident
in
training.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
by
a
physician
where
the
hospital
has
a
teaching
program
approved
as
specified.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
you
are
trying
to
charge
here,
as
i
understand
it,
unless
i
mistake
the
case,
are
not
services
provided,
but
rather
the
costs
of
training
these
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
are
they
providing
care...
i
thought
what
you
were
talking
about
is,
you
know,
we've
all
of
us
been
sick
in
a
hospital
and
the
doctor
comes
in
and
he
has
three
young
doctors
with
him,
you
know,
and
they
are
all
saying,
oh,
wow,
ooh,
and
aah,
but
they
are
not
providing
any
services.
they
are
just
learning
from
what
the
other
doctor
does.
i
thought
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sometimes,
but
in
order
to
recover
under
the
statute,
you
must
provide
services,
as
i
see
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
whenever
they
are,
it
seems
to
me
you're
entitled
to
it
under
the
statute.
do
you
claim
that
you
are
entitled
to
it
when
they're
not
providing
services,
when
they're
just
standing
around
looking?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
basis
for
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
committee
report
which
the
secretary
has
chosen
to
follow
in
his
regulation.
now,
i
have
no
problem
with
the
secretary's
following
a
committee
report
in
the
regulation
to
be
overly
generous
to
hospitals,
if
he
wishes,
and
nobody
has
standing
to
challenge
that,
if
he
gives
the
hospital
more
money
than
they're
entitled
to,
but
you're
coming
in
and
saying
that
he
must
do
it
in
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
that
we
have
authority
to
compel
the
secretary
to
be
consistent.
i
mean,
consistency
in
a
regulation
is
admirable,
and
legally
necessary,
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
legally
necessarily
where
to
make
him
be
consistent
would
make
him
contravene
the
words
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
explicitly
defines
services
to
include
the
services
provided
by
trainees,
but
not
to
include
the
training
of
the
trainees.
now,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
secretary
wants
to
be
more
generous
in
some
instances
to
avoid
controversy
with
a
committee,
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutter,
if
you
could
answer...
i
don't
want
to
take...
you
have
very
little
time
left,
but
you
raised
section...
do
i
understand
the
effect
of
subsection
(2),
which
is
a
definition
of
physicians'
services,
is
to
exclude
for
the
future
services
provided
by
physicians
who
are
employed
in
the
educational
institution,
even
if
they
are
direct
services
provided
to
the
patient?
justice
antonin
scalia
(q).
justice
antonin
scalia
that
defines
physicians'
services
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--(v)(1)(q).
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
the
wrong
section.
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
my
problem.
what
provision
do
you
rely
upon
to
allow
any
of
these
educational
costs
to
be
given?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
medical
care
includes
medical
education.
justice
antonin
scalia
medical
care
to
me
includes
medical
education
for
somebody
who
never
treats
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
gives
the
secretary
the
authority
to
decide
whether
to
include
it
in
or
out
on
the
basis
of
her
notion
of,
there
should
be
community
support,
or
there
should
be
no
declining
in
the
amount
of
community
support?
i
mean,
where
does
she
get
this
policy
authority
in
a
totally
separate
field?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
word
in
the
statute
is
she
interpreting
by
this
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
x(v)(1)(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
yes,
i
have
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
cost
of
services,
is
the
language
essentially
that
she's
interpreting.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
she
says
that
it
constitutes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
and
it
constitutes
a
service
which
you
have
to
pay
for
if
it's
been
charged
before,
but
if
it
hasn't
been
charged
before,
it
doesn't
cons...
how
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
it...
it
either
is
a
service,
or
it
isn't
a
service.
i
mean,
i
can
see
a
lot
of
factors
that
give
her
discretion
to
decide
whether
it's
a
service
or
not,
but
whether
it's
been
provided
before
or
not,
you
know,
charged
a
certain
way
before?
that
seems
to
me
totally
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
presume
the
secretary
is
entitled
to
act
in
gross,
and
to
make
some
assumptions
that
are
generally
true,
even
if
they're
not
true
in
every
instance,
and
i
guess
he's
assuming
that
if
you
haven't
charged
them
before,
they
were
not
incurred
before,
or
there
was
funding
from
elsewhere
to
take
care
of
them
before,
and
he
can
apply
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
trying
to
help
you,
ms.
wax.
[laughter]
and
he
can
apply
that
rule
generally
even
if
you
have
some
instances
where
it's
not
true.
