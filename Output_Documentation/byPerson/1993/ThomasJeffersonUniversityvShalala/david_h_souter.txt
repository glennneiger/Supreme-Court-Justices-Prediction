justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
it
has
a
carryover
effect,
i
take
it
what
you
mean
is
that
if
it's
allowed
for
the
base
year,
you
go
on
charging
the
same
amount
every
successive
year
adjusted
for
inflation
so
long
as
you
do
not
pull
back
on
the
service?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
gives
you
a
rate,
in
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i'm--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
were
they
being
billed
to
the
hospital
by
the
school?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it's...
if...
but...
it
may
not
be
necessary,
but
isn't
it
relevant,
because
if
we
don't
look
to
the
billing
practice,
then
i'm
not
sure
how
the
redistribution
provision
is
ever
going
to
be
applied
in
any
consistent
fashion
when
related
organizations
are
involved,
because
your
argument
in
effect
would
be,
because
it's
a
related
organization,
it
doesn't
have
to
bill,
and
therefore
nothing
in
effect
is
ever
redistributed
because
we
just
looked
to
the
total
entity.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
say
they
can't
bill
for
first-year
medical
education,
for
example.
that
would
be
a
redistribution.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
also
be
clearly
forbidden
by
the
statute.
among
the
possible
subjects
of
billing
from
the
school
to
the
hospital,
as
a
practical
matter,
will
there
be
any
application
of
the
redistribution
limitation?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
give
me
an
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
isn't
that
a
related
institution,
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
as
between
simply
the
hospital
and
the
medical
school,
those
two
related
entities,
assuming
that
we
again
are
talking
about
a
charge
which
is
at
least
indirectly
related
to
education,
can
there
ever
be
a
redistribution
and
hence
an
application
of
this
limit?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it
was
strictly...
i
guess
my
problem
i'm
having
is,
if
it
were
its
own
program
in
the
sense
that
i
think
you're
using
that
term,
then
it
would
not
in
fact
be
related
to
the
teaching
function
of
the
hospital,
so
once
we
get
within
the
sphere
of
what
is
related
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
hospital's
teaching
function,
i
think
the
implication
of
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
redistribution
provision
will
never
apply
when
we're
doing
cost
accounting
within
a
series
of
related
entities.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
illegitimate
shift
that
you
posit
is
illegitimate
because
it
really
is
not
related
indirectly
to
the
provision
of
medical
education
by
the
hospital.
i
mean,
the
reason...
if
i
understand
it,
the
reason
the
attempt
to
shift
the
nursing
cost
fails
is
that
the
nursing
cost
has
nothing
to
do...
that
the
cost
of
providing
instruction
in
the
nursing
school
is
not
indirectly
related
to
the
provision
of
the
medical
education
which
is
subject
to
reimbursement
under
medicare.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
don't
understand
the
hypo,
i
guess.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
this
case
it's
provided
by
a
related
entity,
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
in
the
same
boat
as
whatever
education
is
provided
by
the
medical
school.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
you
were
telling
us
that
if
the
entities
are
related,
that
distinction
is
one
which
does
not
matter.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
okay,
i
see
what
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
fact,
you
could
only,
as
it
were,
as
a
matter
of
accounting
you
could
only
shift
that
to
the
medical
school,
and
shifting
it
to
the
medical
school
doesn't
get
it
to
the
provider,
which
is
the
hospital.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
the
johnny-come-lately
rule
an
attempt,
at
least
in
part,
to
apply
the
redistribution
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question.
with
respect
to
related
entities,
why
didn't
you...
why
isn't
the
only
consistent
position,
or
why
wouldn't
the
only
consistent
position
have
been
to
apply
the
johnny-come-lately
rule
in
effect
at
year
1,
and
at
day
1,
and
say
that
if,
in
your
internal
accounting
as
between
these
related
entities,
the
school
had
not
been
billing
the
hospital,
you
may
not
start
billing
the
hospital,
i.e.
with
implications
for
medicare,
now.
conversely,
if
you
didn't
take
that
position,
why
is
there
ever
going
to
be
a
rational
cutoff?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
i'm
really
asking
why
shouldn't
it
have
been
taken?
if
a
johnny-come-lately
rule
is
appropriate,
it
seems
to
me
it
should
have
been
appropriate
at
day
1,
and
if
it
was
not
appropriate,
and
in
any
case
was
not
applied
at
day
1,
what
is
the
justification,
short
of
a
new
act
of
congress,
for
applying
it
later
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
had
the
costs...
had
the
costs
that
you
admit
are
allowable
been
the
subject
of
some
kind
of
billing
or
accounting
notation,
at
least,
as
between
the
school
and
the
hospital,
prior
to
medicare?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
just
stick
to
redistribution
for
a
moment.
justice
david
h.
souter
why,
if...
why
wasn't
it
inconsistent
with
redistribution
the
first
year
they
claimed
it
in
'74?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
they
were
all
of
the
costs
that
were
being
claimed
prior
to
'85.
i
mean,
just
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument.
if
those
were
the
costs
they
were
claiming,
and
they
had
not
claimed
them
prior
to
'74,
why
didn't
that
constitute
an
attempted
redistribution
in
'74?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they
incurred
them
prior
to
'74,
and
had
not
claimed
them
before
'74,
would
it
have
been
an
attempted
redistribution
within
the
meaning
of
(c)?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
argument
is
that
you
can't
tax
the...
that
the
other
side
cannot
tax
the
government
with
inconsistency
because
at
least
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
neither
it
nor
the
government
knows
what
was
happening
before
'74,
and
the
only
thing
that
you
know
for
sure
is
what
is
happening
as
to
1985.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
can
say
that
about
every
hospital
and
every
charge
prior
to
medicare.
somebody
was
paying
for
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
sutter,
is
the
same
charge
that
you're
contesting
or
claiming
to
make
here
also
being
made
against
insurance
payers
and
self-payers?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
answer
is
yes?
