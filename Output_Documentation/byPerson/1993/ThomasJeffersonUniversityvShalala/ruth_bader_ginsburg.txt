mr.
sutter,
is
your
position
essentially
that
the
secretary
has
interpreted
a
regulation
one
way
and
arbitrarily
not
applying
that
same
way
to
you?
i
thought
that
was
essentially
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
because
you're
making
this
claim
late,
you're
being
treated
differently?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
your
opening
point
was
to
the
extent
that
these
particular
costs,
as
being
properly
reimbursable
if
you
had
made
your
claim
on
time--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
not
contested
by
the
secretary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
continuing
significance
of
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
it,
after
1986,
this
is
no
longer
a
problem
because
the
system
is
different,
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
impact
of
the
issue
before
us
is
for
how
many
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
point
where
it
will
make
no
difference?
that
is,
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
time
span
we're
dealing
with,
and
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
how
long
will
this
matter
that
you're
complaining
about
have
an
impact
on
hospitals
situated
as
you
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
you
get
in
1
year--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
charged--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
charged
some
indirect
costs.
the
year
before
you
had...
you
went
over
all
of
your
costs
to
see
what
you
could
allocate.
you
had...
didn't
you
have
an
adjustment
for
some
indirect
costs
in
'84,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
were
allowed...
you
were
allowed
the
addition
that
you
sought
in
'84.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
'85
you
weren't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then
in
effect
aren't
you
reading
the
redistribution
sentence
out
of
the
regulation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you're
saying
if
it's
covered
by
the
statute
and
if
you
could
claim
it,
you
can
claim
it
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
so
helpful
if
you
would
give
an
example--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
something
that
fits
within
the
statute
as
a
legitimate
cost,
but
couldn't
be
redistributed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
how
many
years
has
that
been
the
secretary's
interpretation...
it
includes
these
training
courses?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
at
what
point
did
the
regulation
start
to
get
interpreted
the
way
it
is
now?
that
is,
you
can't
be
a
johnny-come-lately.
if
you
didn't
ask
for
it
when
you
first
began
providing
the
training,
you
can't
ask
for
it
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
what
happened
in
1984
in
this
case?
because
it
is
an
anomaly
that
they
woke
up
to
one
cost
in
'84
and
they
were
allowed
reimbursement,
and
then
in
'85
when
they
wanted
more,
they
weren't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
the
prr,
or
whatever
it
is,
thought
that
the
administrator
was
wrong
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
all
along.
wasn't...
isn't
it
true
that
it
was...
they
didn't
start
until
late?
they
didn't
start
until
'74.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
didn't
start
when
medicare
first
came
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
isn't
your
answer
the
same
as
the
one
you
gave
me
with
respect
to
'84,
and
that
is,
the
initial...
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
intermediary
let
it
through,
so
it
never
came
to
your
attention.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
wax,
maybe
you
would
focus
on
the
aha
brief
on
page
22,
where
they
give
specific
examples
of
the
kind
of
arbitrariness
that
justice
stevens
brought
up
to
you.
that
is,
two
hospitals
identically
situated,
one
has
a
better
accountant
and
starts
charging
these
costs
from
year
1,
and
the
other
one
doesn't
have
such
a
good
accountant
and
doesn't
wake
up
till
10
years
later,
and
that's
the
whole
difference,
not
whether
they
belong
to
harvard
or
to
cornell
or
whatever.
so
if
you
would...
i
would
like
to
know
your
answer
to
what's
set
out
in
that...
page
22
of
that
brief,
where
the
presentation
is
hospitals
identically
situated
except
one
was
sleeping
and
the
other
was
alert.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
skip
the
community,
because
you
told
justice
stevens
that
the
redistribution
clause
in
and
of
itself
would
do
it,
so
i'd
like
to
hear
your
rationale
for
this,
forgetting
about
the
community.
you
said
that
sentence
of
your
regulation
alone
is
independently
sufficient
to
reach
the
result
that
you
agree
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
community
support
constitutes
everything
except
medicare,
is
that
right?
all
sources
that
pay
for
this
service,
other
than
medicare,
is
community.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
else
is
left
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
wax,
would
it
matter
if
the
hospital...
this
hospital
were
able
to
show
that
its
sources
were
no
different
from
the
sources
of
a
hospital
who
started
to
make
these
costs...
pay
these
costs
from
day
1?
in
other
words,
coming
back
to
the
example
that
was
given,
and
i
think
you
say,
yes,
that's
the
way
our
regulation
works,
on
page
22.
the
american
hospital
association
wasn't
inaccurate
in
setting
that
out,
and
what
they're
giving
is
examples
of
a
hospitals
identically
situated
except
for
one
started
charging
earlier,
and
the
other
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
because
it
had
a
richer
endowment,
or
got
more
money
from
the
state
in
which
it
operated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
institution
proves
that
it
wasn't
in
any
of
these
fortunate
situations,
it
just
had
a
sleepy
accountant?
