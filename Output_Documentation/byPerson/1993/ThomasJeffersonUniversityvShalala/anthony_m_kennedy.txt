well,
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
that
mean
that
the
secretary
could
not,
under
a
properly
drawn
regulation,
deny
these
costs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
petitioner
here
is
thomas
jefferson
university
which
is
located
in
philadelphia,
pennsylvania
and
the
dispute
is
between
a
teaching
hospital
that
is
run
by
the
university
and
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
the
dispute
is
over
the
scope
of
medicare
reimbursement
for
costs
relating
to
the
hospital's
education
and
training
programs
for
interns
and
residents.
although
medicare
reimbursed
its
hospitals
for
the
cost
of
certain
educational
activities,
medicare
is
forbidden
by
regulation
from
reimbursing
costs
that
have
been
redistributed
from
a
medical
school
to
a
hospital.
all
agreed
that
the
cost
here
in
dispute
were
born
in
prior
years,
not
by
the
hospital
but
by
the
hospital's
affiliated
medical
school.
the
secretary
determined
these
costs
were
not
reimbursable
because
they
were
the
result
of
an
impermissible
redistribution
under
the
pertinent
regulation.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
both
affirmed
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
its
regulation,
as
do
we.
in
reviewing
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulation,
we
must
defer
to
the
secretary's
construction
of
the
language
unless
it
is
plainly
erroneous
or
inconsistent
with
the
regulation.
in
our
view,
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
not
only
a
plausible
interpretation
it
is
the
most
sensible
interpretation
the
language
will
bear.
the
pertinent
sentence
of
the
regulation
provides
as
follows:
although
we
intended
the
medicare
programers
to
share
in
the
support
of
the
educational
activities
customarily
or
traditionally
carried
on
by
providers
in
conjunction
with
their
operations,
it
is
not
intended
that
this
program
should
participate
in
increased
costs
resulting
from
redistribution
of
cost
from
educational
institutions
or
units
to
patient
care
institutions
or
units.
we
agree
with
the
secretary
that
the
meaning
of
this
sentence
is
straightforward.
its
introductory
clause
defines
the
scope
of
educational
activities
for
which
reimbursement
maybe
sought
and
its
second
clause
provides
that
the
cost
of
these
activities
will
not
be
reimbursed
if
they
result
from
a
shift
of
cost
from
an
educational
to
a
patient
care
facility.
because
the
disputed
cost
in
this
case
was
shifted
from
a
medical
school
to
the
hospital,
the
secretary
was
within
her
discretion
in
concluding
that
reimbursement
would
constitute
an
impermissible
redistribution
under
the
terms
of
the
regulation.
and
finally,
because
the
application
of
this
portion
of
the
regulation
suffices
to
bar
reimbursement
in
the
case,
we
need
not
address
whether
there
is
any
other
language
in
the
regulation
that
may
provide
an
independent
reason
for
denial
of
reimbursement.
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
o'connor,
and
ginsburg
join.
