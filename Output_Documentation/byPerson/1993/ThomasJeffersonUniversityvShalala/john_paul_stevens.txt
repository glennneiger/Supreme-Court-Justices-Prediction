justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
you
saying
that
the
words
"redistribution
of
costs"
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
regulation
really
should
be
read
to
mean
"redistribution
of
services
or
activities"?
that's
what
you
seem
to
be
saying,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
your
example
of
something
that
would
fit
within
the
regulation
would
have
involved
a
reorganization
of
the
provision
of
services
and
the
activities.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
would
the
case...
would
the
regulation
ever
apply
to
a
hospital
which
acted
in
precisely
the
same
way
over
the
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions
to
be
sure,
because
it
does
seem
to
get
complicated.
is
he
correct
in
telling
us
that
if
another
institution
were
claiming
precisely
these
same
costs,
and
had
claimed
them
for
the
last
10
years
and
been
allowed
in
the
past,
that
it
would
be
allowed
these
costs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
it's
exactly
like
this
in
all...
it's
exactly
like
this
institution
in
all
respects,
except
that
it
had
always
claimed
the
same
costs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
this
institution
had
claimed
these
very
costs
5
years
earlier
and
done
it
each
year,
would
it
get
them
this
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
sort
of
elementary
question,
i
suppose.
you
talk
about
both
the
antidistribution
principle
and
the
community
support
principle,
and
i
must
confess
to
some
difficulty
knowing
exactly
what
is
and
is
not
community
support,
but
put
that
to
one
side.
are
these
independent...
is
each
an
independently
sufficient
reason
for
your
prevailing,
or
do
they
rely
on
one
another?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
last
sentence
of
the
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
part
of
the
regulation
isn't
at
all
that
clear,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
i
find
most
hard
to
sort
of
sort
out
in
my
mind
about
this
case
is,
i
can
envision
half-a-dozen
different
institutions
providing
precisely
the
same
services
with
precisely
the
same
costs
to
do
it,
the
same
salaries
and
everything
else.
some
will
get
reimbursed,
some
will
not,
depending
on
what
kind
of
community
support
they
get,
and
what
other
accounting
worked
in
the
past.
those
seem
to
be
totally
irrelevant
to
the
fairness
of
treating
all
hospitals
providing
the
same
services
alike.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statutory
language
that
you
called
our
attention
to
talks
about
costs
for
various
types
or
classes
of
institutions,
agencies,
and
services,
which
conveys
to
me
a
message
that
there
are
groups
of
institutions
that
should
be
treated
like,
and
you
read
that
as
sort
of
saying
we
can
do
it
on
a
community
support.
it
certainly
doesn't
change
the
class
or
type
of
institution,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't...
well,
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
classes
of
institution
could
be,
if
you've
got
100
hospitals,
each
one
is
in
a
different
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
those
are
classes,
but
we're
talking
about
discrimination
among...
within
the
class
of
teaching
hospitals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
it's
a
separate
class
of
hospital
if
it
gets
a
lot
of
money
from
charity,
or
doctors
pay
high
tuition,
or
something
like
that.
that
is,
the
students
pay
high
tuition.
that's...
different
kinds
of
community
support
make
it
a
different
class
of
hospital.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
do
agree,
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
that
a
teaching
hospital
can
get
paid
more
for
precisely
the
same
services
than
a
nonteaching
hospital.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
the
cost
of
having
the
interns
participate
in
the
training,
and
the
education,
the
whole
thing.
the
educational
function
of
the
teaching
hospital
will
qualify
for
a
higher
payment
for
precisely
the
same
services
that
would
be
available
in
a
nonteaching
hospital.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
response
really
to
justice
o'connor's
suggestion
that
there's
an
overall
cap.
there
really
isn't
as
to
teaching
hospitals.
