wax,
i
thought
there
was
a
general
provision
to
the
effect
that
costs
can't
exceed
the
price
of
comparable
services,
facilities,
or
supplies
that
could
be
purchased
elsewhere,
so
there's
an
overall
cap
and
an
overall
mechanism
in
any
event,
is
there
not,
to
hold
down
costs
that
are
reimbursed?

i
mean,
suppose
you
lose
on
this
particular
theory
of
yours,
there
is
another
mechanism
in
place,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
is
a
provision
that
says,
whatever
costs
xx
allow
a
hospital,
it
can't
be
more
than
that
which
could
be
purchased
elsewhere,
so
she
has
an
overall
cap
in
effect.
