chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
93-120,
thomas
jefferson
university
v.
donna
e.
shalala.
mr.
sutter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
i
asked
you
if
you
claimed
under
a
particular
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
do
claim
that
they're...
you're
entitled
to
recover
for
costs
expended
on
them,
even
when
they're
not
providing
service?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say,
mr.
sutter,
that
you
could
prevail
simply
under
the
statute
without
regard
to
the
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
quoted
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
that
is
my
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sutter.
ms.
wax,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
like
having
an
intern
or
a
resident
there
during
the
night,
when
maybe
simply
a
for-pay
hospital
wouldn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me,
ms.
wax,
that
congress
did
advert
to
this
airy
benefit
that
you're
referring
to
and
didn't
include
it.
i
mean,
it
says...
it
refers
to
interns
or
residents
in
training,
but
it
refers
to
them
only
as
inpatient
hospital
services.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
here
she
can
draw
a
line
and
tell
people,
that's
the
way
the
cookie
crumbles,
in
effect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
the
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
mr.
sutter,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say,
congress
encouraged
the
secretary
not
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
congress
authorized
the
secretary
to
but
didn't
require
her
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
she
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sutter.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
93-120,
thomas
jefferson
university
versus
shalala
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
