mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
is
whether
certain
costs
incurred
by
petitioner...
by
petitioner's
related
medical
school
in
support
of
petitioner's
graduate
medical
education
program
are
allowable
under
medicare.
there's
no
question
that
these
costs,
which
are
clerical
and
support
costs
in
support
of
the
program,
would
normally
be
allowable
costs.
the
government
has
conceded
that.
the
question
is,
are
they
unallowable
because
the
hospital
did
not
claim
these
costs
in
prior
years.
it
is
important
to
understand
the
implications
of
the
government's
position.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
because
the--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--the
statute
requires
the
reimbursement
of
reasonable
cost--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--and
it
requires...
this
will
be
found
in
the
ohio
state
amicus
brief
at
pages
1
and
2.
it
requires
the
reimbursement
of
direct
and
indirect
costs.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
costs
that
are
necessary
in
the
efficient
delivery
of
needed
health
services.
that
would
be
the
opening...
opening
phrase,
the
first
three
or
four
lines
of
the
provision.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
it
is
the
cost
of
services,
too,
justice
scalia,
because
interns
and
residents
are
actually
providing
care
in
the
hospital,
and
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
stipends
that
are
paid
to
them,
the
compensation
paid
to
the
teaching
physicians,
and
the
related
support
costs,
and--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--sometimes
they
provide
services.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
a
lot
of
times
they
are
providing
services.
they
do
come
in
and
examine
patients,
and
it's
true
they
observe,
but
they're
also
providing
services.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
we
claim
that
they
are
entitled
to
reimbursement
for
all
the
reasonable
costs
in
connection
with
the
training.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
oh,
sure.
yes.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
when
they're
learning?
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
yes.
but
the
entire
program's
a
clinical
program.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
this
is
not
a
classroom
instruction.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
the
statute
says--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--certainly.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
certainly,
yes.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
these--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
these--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--certainly.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that
is
correct.
this
was
still
under
the
reasonable
cost
system,
and
effective
for
years.
beginning
on
or
after
july
1,
1985,
there
is
a
new
system
in
effect.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
it
will
have
a
carryover
impact
because
this
is
the
base
year,
and
under
the
new
system
you
look
at
the
cost
per
resident
trended
forward,
so
the
monetary
impact
for
this
year
itself,
for
'85,
would
be
roughly
$600,000
to
$700,000,
but
it
would
also
have
some
carryover
effect.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
specifically
we're
dealing
with
1985.
that
is
the
year
under
appeal.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
it
could
have
an
indefinite
impact,
until
congress
changes
the
current
law,
which
still
looks
back
at
a
base
year
and
trends
it
forward.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
actually,
it's...
you
get
a
base
year
amount
per
resident,
and
then
you
would
multiply
that
by
your
current
number
of
residents,
so
if
the
number
of
residents
declines--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--it
gives...
it's
a
rate.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
it's
a
rate
per
resident,
that's
correct.
to
follow
up,
though,
under
the
regulation,
these
are
regarded
as
indirect
costs
under
paragraph
(g),
and
the
secretary
has
conceded
in
her
petition,
her
cert
petition,
that
these
would
normally
be
allowable
costs.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i
don't
think
it
contravenes
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
says,
in
the
efficient
delivery
of
needed
health
services,
and
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
have
good
health
services
if
you
don't
train
your
interns
and
residents.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
but
it
does--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--well,
justice
scalia,
congress
has
never
expressed
any
dissatisfaction
with
the
inclusion
of
these
costs.
when
the
secretary
attempted
to
limit
increases
on
them
in
1985,
the
congress
did
enact
legislation
to
preclude
that,
which
is
42
u.s.c.
section
1395x(v)(1)(a).
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i'm
sorry,
not--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--excuse
me...
(q).
(q).
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
the
chronology
is
that
in
'74
for
the
first
time
the
hospital
began
claiming
the
costs
of
the
related
medical
school
and
claimed
costs
for
physician
compensation.
in
'84,
it
began
to
claim
some
of
the
clerical
costs,
and
then
'85
claimed
the
remainder.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that
is
correct,
yes,
but
we
really
do
have
the
situation
here
where,
to
give
you
a
hypothetical
of
how
it
would
operate,
say
in
years
1
through
5,
if
a
hospital
had,
say,
claimed
the
physician
compensation
for
a
particular
teacher
in
the
gme
program
but
that
would
have
been
allowed,
but
say
in
year
6
it
failed
to
claim
it,
under
the
secretary's
position
you
would
have
the
situation
where
for
year
7
and
thereafter,
the
secretary
would...
or
the
hospital
would
forever
lose
out.
and
i
think
that's
very
hard
to
justify
with
the
statute,
which
talks
about
reimbursing
actual
cost,
excluding
therefore
only
that
part
found
to
be
unnecessary
in
the
efficient
delivery
of
needed
health
services,
and
if
something
is
necessary
in
years
1
through
5,
it
should
be
necessary
in
year
7.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
we
say
both,
but
we
do
say--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--yes.
the
answer
to
the
question
is
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
say--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--that
would
be
our
contention,
that
they
are
part
of
the
necessary
delivery
of
needed
health
services,
that's
correct,
and
they
have
been
from
the
beginning.
they
have
been
allowed
from
the
beginning,
and
there
are
many
university
hospitals
that
for
many
years
have
been
reimbursed
for
these
costs,
and
most
teaching
hospitals
do
not
have...
are
not
university
hospitals,
do
not
have
related
medical
schools.
they
incur
these
costs
directly,
and
what
we
really
have
here
is
a
distinction
that
is
not
based
on
medical
necessity
and
is
not
based
on
benefit
to
the
patient,
and
there
is
tremendous
benefit
to
the
patient
in
being
in
a
teaching
institution.
if
you
have
a
serious
medical
condition,
certainly
i
would
want
to
go
to
a
teaching
facility.
that
is
where
the
best
care
is
given,
and
i
think
the
training
of
these
interns
and
residents
is
essential
for
continuing
to
have
high
quality
care
in
the
country.
now,
if
i
could
look
specifically
at
the
regulations,
the
secretary's
position
here
conflict
with
both
the
medical
education
regulation
itself
and
with
the
related
organization
regulation.
the
medical
education
regulation
is
quoted
in
relevant
part
at
pages
9
through
11
of
the
aha
amicus
brief.
the
government
has--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
the
aha
aamc
amicus
brief.
the
secretary
has
focused
exclusively
on
paragraph
(c),
but
it
is
very
important
to
read
the
regulation
in
context.
there
are
specific
provisions,
mandatory
provisions
in
there,
paragraphs
(a),
(b),
and
(g),
and
(a)
says
that
providers
are
entitled
to
reimbursement
of
net
costs
as
calculated
in
(g),
and
(g)
describes
the
costs
which
are
included
and
the
revenues
which
must
be
offset.
in
contrast,
paragraph
(c)
is
phrased
in
very
general,
descriptive,
precatory
language.
it
would
seem
very
strange
as
a
general
proposition
to
construe
that
language
as
imposing
broad,
draconian
disallowances.
it
would
seem
particularly
strange
when
(a)
says
that
you...
you
reimburse
under
(g),
not
(c),
and
(g)
does
not
include
a
cross-reference
to
(c).
but
let's
look
at
(c).
the
secretary
has
construed
that
as
establishing
two
principles,
the
so-called
redistribution
principle
and
the
so-called
community
support
principle.
the
redistribution
is
based
on
the
last
sentence,
and
the
community
support
on
the
prior
sentence.
let
me
begin
with
the
redistribution.
the
last
sentence
refers
to
a
redistribution
of
costs,
but
it
does
not
define
that
term,
and
the
secretary
has
simply
assumed
that
there
has
been
a
redistribution
of
costs
here,
but
there
has
not.
there
has
been
a
first-time
claim,
but
the
costs
were
not
distributed
in
1985
any
differently
than
they
were
previously.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no,
they
weren't,
but
that's
not
necessary
under
the
related
organization
regulation.
these--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--that's
not
my
argument.
my
argument
is
that
you
have
a
redistribution
where
you
have
a
situation
where
a
hospital
begins
billing
for
costs
which
in
the
past
were
incurred
by
an
educational
institution
for
that
institution's
own
educational
program.
in
other
words,
it
begins
billing
for
costs
which
in
the
past
it
could
not
have
billed
for.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
absolutely.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
there
could
be.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
sure.
if...
say
there's
a
related
medical
school,
and
the...
and
the...
sorry,
not
related
medical
school,
a
related
nursing
school,
and
the
nursing
school
has
for
many
years
provided
classroom
instruction.
it
is
part
of
the
nursing
school's
program.
they
are
not
providing
it
as
part
of
the
hospital's
program,
and
suddenly
they
decide
ah,
well,
let's
see
if
we
can
get
the
hospital
to
claim
these
costs.
you
couldn't
do
it,
because
that
would
be
a
redistribution.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no,
because
the
nursing
school
was
not
providing
those
services
in
the
past
as
part
of
the
hospital's
educational
program.
see,
in
this
case,
this
is
the
hospital's
educational
program.
it
has
always
been
the
hospital's
educational
program.
the
related
medical
school
has
provided
services
in
the
past
and
in
'85,
but
if
you
look
at
the
related
organization
principle,
it
says
the
related
organization
is
essentially
the
alter
ego
of
the
hospital.
you
will
find
that
in
paragraph
(c)(2),
and
the
regulation
is
quoted
on
6
through
8
of
the
ohio
state
amicus
brief
appendix.
so
essentially
what
you
have
here
is
you
have
the
hospital...
these
really
would
always
be
the
hospital's
services.
they
were
incurred
by
the
medical
school,
but
under
the
related
organization
they
would
always
be
regarded
as
the
hospital
services.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i
think
only
if
you
had
some
activity
that
the
medical
school
was
conducting
in
the
past
that
was
its
own
program.
i
don't...
i
would
have
a--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--that's
right
if--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--if
it
is
the
program,
and
i
think
there
are
two
policy
issuances
that
are
essentially
on
point
there.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--i'm
not
reading
it
out.
i
am
reading
it
exactly
as
it
is
read
in
provider
reimbursement
manual
404.2,
which
is
at
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
56
through
58,
and
as
it
is
read
in
intermediary
letter--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--i
will
give
you
an
example.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
legitimate
costs
is
nursing
education.
that's
a
legitimate
cost.
other
costs
are
in
paragraph
(e),
and
if
you
look
at...
that's
not
quoted
in
my
brief,
but
it
is
quoted
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
34
through
38.
that
is
the
original
regulation,
but
in
paragraph
(e)
there
is
a
list
of
about
13
different
activities.
all
of
those
could
be
examples
of
something
that's
provided
by
a
related
organization
as
part
of
their
own
program
which
would
be
reimbursable
under
medicare...
well,
it
wouldn't
be
reimbursable
under
medicare
if
it
wasn't
provided
by
a
provider,
so
if
you
had
it
in
some
other
part,
some
other
part
of,
say,
the
university,
and
suddenly
you
try
to
shift
that
and
make
it
a
provider
program,
you
couldn't
do
it.
any
of
those
examples--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--that's
not
correct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
nursing
education
is
reimbursable
under
medicare
if
it's
provided
by
the
provider,
but
you
have
situations,
justice
souter--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--well,
it
depends
who
is
the
legal
operator.
if
you
have
a
separate
nursing
school--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--under
the
related
organization,
the
governing
principle
is
(a),
and
that
is,
you
have
services
furnished
by
the
related
organization
for
the
provider
on
behalf
of
the
provider.
they
are
reimbursable
to
the
provider.
if
your
related
organization
is
furnishing
services
on
behalf
of
itself,
that
would
not
be
reimbursable
to
the
provider.
so
if
you
had
a
separate
nursing
school--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--and
it
was
a
related
organization's
nursing
school
you
couldn't
shift
that
back.
you
see,
the
example...
you
do
have--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
yes.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
in
'85
we
are
claiming
costs
that
could
have
been
claimed
before
and
that
weren't.
we're
not...
we
don't
have
a
situation
where
we're
trying
to
claim
in
'85
costs
that
were
not
the
hospital's
before,
weren't
part
of
the
hospital's
program,
and
there
you
couldn't
claim
it,
and
i
think
there's
a
very
good
example
in
prm
section
404.2,
which
is
on
page
57
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
there
the
concern
is
with
redistribution
when
you're
talking
about
a
nonprovider-operated
program,
and
you're
talking
about
something
like
classroom
instruction,
and
elsewhere
they
don't
have
a
redistribution
condition.
also,
specifically
with--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--certainly.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no.
i
think
you
need
to
trace
before,
before
you
get
to
the
year,
say
in
'85
here,
and
see,
under
medicare,
whose
costs
those
properly
would
be
viewed
as.
the
related
organization
principle
would
apply
here
not
only
to
'85
but
before.
these
costs
were
incurred
by
the
medical
school
in
'85
and
before
'85,
but
they
would
always
be
viewed
as
the
provider's
costs.
that
would
be
the
rule
under
413.17(a)
and
(c)(2).
they
would
always
be
regarded
as
a
provider's
costs.
so
i
think
you
need
to
look
at,
under
medicare,
whose
costs
would
these
be,
and
do
you
have
a
different
situation
in
'85
than
you
had
in
'75?
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
not
as
long
as
those
are
for
costs
that
would
consider
to
be
customarily
or
traditionally
carried
on
by
the
hospital,
and
on
this
point,
intermediary
letter
78-7
specifically
applies
to
the
related
organization
principle
in
the
context
of
medical
school
and
the
hospital
and
says
they
are
allowable
under
the
related
organization
principle.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
when
you
say
subsection
(2),
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--oh,
(q).
1395x--
mr.
ronald

no,

mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
v
as
in
very,
(v)(1)(q),
and
what
that
did
is,
it
precluded
the
secretary
from
doing
anything
that
would
reduce
medicare
reimbursement
for
graduate
medical
education.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
briefly
address
community
support.
i
think
it's
important
to
analyze
that
a
little
bit.
suppose
in
1985
the
hospital
had
received
a
$10
million
contribution
from
someone
in
the
community.
could
that
be
offset
as
community
support?
the
answer
is,
it
could
not
be.
an
unrestricted
gift
would
never
have
been
offset
from
the
beginning
of
the
medicare
program,
and
that
was...
by
the
ora
1980
legislation
that
was
made
part
of
legislation,
and
congress
encouraged
the
secretary
also
not
to
offset
restricted
grants.
that
is,
a
grant
that
says,
this
is
specifically
for
gme.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
the...
in
paragraph
3
of
that
legislation,
which
is
on
page
1
of
the
reply
brief,
congress
authorized
the
secretary
to
not
offset
restricted
grants,
and
that
is
an
encouragement
which
the
secretary
responded
to
in
the
1983
federal
register,
so
that
now
you
could
have
someone
actually
in
the
community
donate
$10
million
directly
to
the
hospital,
say
this
is
for
gme,
and
that
could
not
be
offset.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
but
she
did.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
she
did,
in
1983,
so
are
we
going
to
say
a
$10
million
contribution
from
someone
in
the
community
is
not
community
support,
but
somehow
you're
getting
services
from
a
related
medical
school,
and
that
is
community
support?
or
you
could
have
the
medical
school
actually
giving
$5
million
to
the
hospital.
that
could
never
have
been
offset
by
medicare
under
section
607
of
the
provider
reimbursement
manual,
which
is
on
page
21a
of
the
ohio
state
amicus
brief
appendix.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
sense
to
say
that
these
services
constitute
community
support,
when
those
don't.
now,
i
will
say
whatever
rules
apply
to
the
hospital
should
apply
to
the
medical
center.
if
there's
something
that
the
medical
center
receives
that
should
be
offset
if
received
directly
by
the
hospital,
then
you
should
have
an
offset.
but
we
don't
have
that
situation
here,
and
under
the
secretary's
current
regulations,
the
only
thing
that
is
offset
is
tuition,
and
interns
and
residents
do
not
pay
tuition.
instead,
they
receive
a
stipend.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
insurance
payers
don't
usually
pay
on
a
cost
basis.
they
will
pay
charges,
and
the
medical
education
costs
will
be
a
component
in
the
hospital's
charges,
so
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
yes,
that's
correct.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
