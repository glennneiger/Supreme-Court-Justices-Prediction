mr.
john
f.
manning
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
commission's
longstanding
and
consistent
interpretation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
if
a
carrier
wishes
to
meet
its
filed
rate
obligation
by
referring
to
someone
else's
tariff,
he
must
participate
in
a
continuing
agency
relationship
with
that
other
entity.
that
interpretation,
which
goes
back
more
than
50
years,
is
currently
reflected
in
the
commission's
void
for
nonparticipation
rule,
which
provides
that
if
a
carrier
allows
its
participation
in
an
agency
tariff
to
lapse,
the
tariff
becomes
void
as
a
matter
of
law
as
to
that
carrier.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
as
the
icc
indicated
in
its
wonderoast
decision,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
appears
in
8
i.c.c.
2nd,
that
doctrine
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statutory
requirement
that
appears
in
two
sections.
in
section
10702
of
title
49,
it
provides
that
the
carrier
shall
establish
the
rates
for
its
transportation
services
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
the
relevant
subchapter,
and
section
10762
of
title
49
provides
that
the
carrier
shall
file
a
tariff
containing
those
rates,
and
so
in
effect
the
icc
has
interpreted
the
statute
in
a
way
that
places
the
responsibility
on
the
carrier
to
set
its
own
rates.
now,
the
practical
reason,
i
think,
for
the
policy
is
that
these
tariffs
are
very
complicated
and
expensive
to
put
together,
and
a
lot
of
tariffs
are
put
together
by
so-called
rate
bureaus
which
compile
this
information
and
set
up
the
system
of
rules
and
practices
and
so
forth
that
govern
the
transportation
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
act,
and
if
there
were
not
a
participation
requirement
in
the
icc's
rules,
then
everyone
would
literally
free
ride
on
these
agency
tariffs
simply
by
filing
a
tariff
that
referred
to
the
agency
tariff.
that's
why
the
icc's
rules
are
quite
explicit
in
saying
that
when
a
carrier
who
is
a
party
to
a
tariff,
and
that
includes
its
own
tariff,
refers
to
a
separate
tariff,
and
when
its
rates
are
governed
by
that
separate
tariff,
it
must
be
a
participant
in
that
separate
tariff
as
well,
and
that
requirement
is
contained
in
section
1312.27(e),
and
i
just
want
to
pause
for
a
moment
and
address
petitioner's
claim
that
the
decision
in
this
case
is
actually
inconsistent
with
the
icc's
regulations,
when
in
fact
it
is
not.
the
hgb
mileage
guide,
the
tariff
from
which
petitioners...
i'm
sorry,
from
which
riss'
participation
was
cancelled,
is
governed
by
a
provision
contained
in
section
1312.30,
which
is
in
on
pages
9a
and
10a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
and
on
page
10a,
subsection
4
provides
that
except
as
provided
in
the
specified
subsection,
which
refers
to
government
publications,
only
distance
guides
officially
on
file
with
the
commission
may
be
referred
to.
now,
that's
another
way
of
saying,
as
the
commission
explained
in
its
jasper
wyman
decision,
that
a
distance
guide
is
in
fact
a
tariff.
now,
if
you
then
turn
to
page
8a
and
look
at
section
1312.27(e),
the
provision
i've
just
cited,
it
says
that
a
carrier
participating
in
a
tariff
which
refers
to...
in
tariffs
which
refer
to
and
are
governed
by
separate
tariffs,
they
shall
also
participate
in
those
governing
separate
tariffs,
and
that
means
that
when
a
carrier
refers
to
a
mileage
guide,
and
when
its
rates
are
governed
by
that
mileage
guide,
it
must
also
participate
in
that
mileage
guide.
now,
there's
one
other
provision
i
want
to
refer
you
to,
and
that's
the
heart
of
this
case,
and
that's
1312.4(d),
which
is
cited
on
page
3a
of
our
appendix,
and
that
provision
says
that
a
carrier...
and
this...
i'm
starting
at
the
third
line
down,
after
the
word
"however",
a
carrier
may
not
participate
in
a
tariff
issued
in
the
name
of
another
carrier
or
an
agent
unless
a
power
of
attorney
or
concurrence
has
been
executed.
absent
effective
concurrences,
or
powers
of
attorney,
tariffs
are
void
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
we
believe
and
the
commission
has
so
held
in
the
jasper
wyman
decision
as
well
as
other
decisions,
that
if
you
read
those
three
provisions
together,
they
require
the
conclusion
that
a
carrier
must
participate,
must
maintain
an
agency
relationship
with
the
publishers
of
a
mileage
guide
in
order
to
be
able
to
refer
to
that
mileage
guide
as
part
of
its
filed
rate.
now,
riss
did
not
do
that
in
this
case,
as
petitioners
concede,
and
for
that
reason,
although
riss
did
have
a
filed
tariff,
its
tariff
number
501-b
was
on
file,
it
did
not
have
a
filed
rate,
because
a
shipper
who
consulted
riss'
tariff
501-b
would
be
referred
to
the
mileage
guide
to
determine
the
critical
quantity
term
in
the
tariff,
and
examining
the
mileage
guide,
the
carrier
would
see
that
the
mileage
guide
in
a
notice
that's
in
bold
letters
on
page
2
of
that
tariff--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
that
refers
to...
i
think
that
that
sentence
refers
to
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
mr.
augello
described
in
which
hgb
might
come
in
and
say,
there
are
111
carriers
who
refer
to
our
mileage
guide,
but
they
haven't
maintained
their
powers
of
attorney,
they
haven't
paid
their
participation
fees,
and
what
the
commission
has
done
in
those
cases,
and
there
are
two
recent
cases
that
involve
this,
both
of
which
are
cited
in
mr.
augello's
brief,
what
the
commission
will
do
is,
it
will
issue
an
order
to
the
carriers
either
to
reinstate
their
participation
in
the
mileage
guide
tariff,
or
to
cancel
any
reference
to
that
participation.
mr.
john
f.
manning
no,
no,
i
think
that
means
that
if
someone
challenges
the
tariff
on
the
ground
that
a
carrier
has
not--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--maintained,
then
the
carrier
has
to
show
that
it
has
participated.
mr.
john
f.
manning
and
that
raises
an
important
point,
which--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
the
icc
does
believe
that
the
filed
rate
and
the
filed
rate
doctrine
are
central
to
the
whole
scheme
of
regulating
the
transportation
industry,
and
the
icc
does...
has
in
recent
years
taken
an
aggressive
stance
in
enforcing
the
requirement
of
participations.
in
fiscal
year
1993,
i
am
advised
by
the
commission,
the
commission
entered
24
consent
decrees
with
carriers
who
had
let
their
participations
in
mileage
guides
and
other
tariffs
lapse,
and
had
sought
and
obtained
one
injunction,
and
the
proceeding
that
mr.
augello
referred
to,
which
is
in
9
i.c.c.
2nd.
,
was
a
proceeding
in
which
hgb
came
to...
the
household
goods
carriers
bureau
came
to
the
icc
and
said,
we
are
aware
that
this
certain
number
of
carriers
have
not
participated
in
our
mileage
guide
but
are
referring
to
it,
and
the
icc
issued
an
order
pursuant
to
its
broad
remedial
powers
saying
that
these
carriers
either
had
to
make
their
participation
current
or
strike
any
reference
to
the
hgb
mileage
guide
from
their
tariffs.
now,
the
consequence
of
that
obviously
is
that
if
they
do
not
have
a
filed
rate,
any
filed
rate
that
covers
transportation,
it
is
unlawful
for
them
to
undertake
transportation
that's
covered
by
the
act.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
i
think...
i
mean,
i
think
that
a
lot
of
the
problems
that
have
arisen
in
this
case
and
that
are
percolating
up
through
the
system
do
come
from
the
era
prior
to
maislin
in
which
the
commission
was
taking
a
less
aggressive
stance
about
the
centrality
of
the
filed
rate
and
had
a
more
tolerant
view
of
negotiated
rates.
mr.
john
f.
manning
post
maislin
the
commission
is
enforcing
this
requirement,
yes,
it
is.
before
i
close
i'd
like
to
make
one
final
point,
and
that
is
the
retroactivity
point.
mr.
john
f.
manning
oh,
of
course.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
that
might
be...
that
might
be
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
commission's
remedial
discretion.
that
would
obviously
be
a
matter
for
the
commission
to
decide
in
the
first
instance.
i
would
simply
point
out
that
this
case
arises
from
a
private
lawsuit
filed
by
security
services,
incorporated
against
the
k
mart
corporation,
and
it
was
not
a
proceeding
before
the
commission.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that
is
correct.
whatever
remedial
action
the
commission
may
take
in
the
future
concerning
the
enforcement
of
the
filed
rate,
the
fact
remains
that
in
this
case
there
was
no
filed
rate,
and
in
order
for
petitioner
to
sustain
its
undercharge
claim
it
must
affirmatively
point
to
and
rely
on
the
existence
of
a
filed
rate.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
that's
true,
the
carrier
is
not
providing
any--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--the
carrier
is
not
providing
any
additional
services.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
that's
the
only
number
that
is...
that
the
commission
has
encountered
in
any
official
way.
i'm
not
sure
where
the--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
if...
i
mean,
based
on
the
number
of
violations
that
have
been
brought
to
the
commission's
attention
by
hgb,
which
has
every
incentive
to
police
the
nonpayment
of
dues
by
those
who
refer
to
is
mileage
guide,
i
would
think
that
the
problem
is
not
particularly
significant
as
a
percentage
of
the
total
participants.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--oh,
i'd
be
happy
to.
the
government's
position
is
that
this
is
not
a
retroactive
invalidation
of
the
rule...
i'm
sorry,
of
the
tariff.
this
is,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
precisely
the
same
thing
as
if
the
carrier's
own
tariff
had
expired
or
been
cancelled.
the
commission's
consistent
view
has
been
that
if
a
carrier
cancels
its
own
tariff,
even
if
it's
accidental,
that
cancellation
is
effective
without
the
commission's
taking
any
form
of
action
to
validate
or
formalize
the
cancellation,
and
here,
the
participation
of
riss
in
hgb
mileage
guide
100
tariff
was
cancelled
by
operation
of
its
agent,
the
household
goods
carriers
bureau.
that
cancellation
was
duly
published
in
a
tariff
filed
by
hgb
pursuant
to
commission
rules.
under
commission
rules,
and
that's
specifically
rule
1312.10(a),
if
a
power
of
attorney
is
cancelled,
if
a
participation
is
cancelled,
that
cancellation
is
not
effective
until
it
is
published
in
a
tariff,
and
so
in
other
words,
the
cancellation
only
becomes
effective
when
the
public
gets
notice
of
it,
and
in
that
respect
it
is
very
much
like
the
expiration
or
cancellation
of
the
carrier's
own
tariff.
mr.
john
f.
manning
yes.
mr.
john
f.
manning
oh,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
that
is
part
of
the
hgb
mileage
guide
100
tariff,
and
the
shipper
is
on
constructive
notice
of
what's
contained
in
that
notice,
but
we
would
say
that
even
if
that
notice
were
not
part
of
the
tariff,
this
would
be
the
same
case,
because
the
commission's
rules
clearly
state
that
a
tariff
must
list
all
of
the
participants
in
that
tariff,
either
in
the
tariff
or
in
a
separate
participating
carrier's
tariff,
and
that's
1312.13(c),
and
the
tariff
1312.17,
which
pertains
to
amendments...
that's
subsection
(b)(2)...
also
says
that
if
a
carrier's
participation
in
a
tariff
is
cancelled,
that
cancellation
must
be
noted
in
the
tariff.
