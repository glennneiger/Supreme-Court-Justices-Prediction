how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
no
solvent
carriers
ever
brought
any
of
these
actions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
bring
any
of
them?
are
there
any
solvent
carriers
in
this
whole
family
of
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
are
nonpaying
shippers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
undercharged
suits
that
you
know
of
brought
by
solvent
carriers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
another
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
this
general
category?
are
there
any
suits
brought
by
competitors
of
shippers
claiming
they
were
hurt
by
these
discriminatory
rates
that
you
know
of?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
surprising,
if
there's
this
strong
public
interest
supporting
the
full
enforcement
of
the
tariff
rate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
why
he
couldn't
file
a
tariff
that
says
i'm
only
charged
for
the
first
300
miles
of
the
carriage,
as
sort
of
a...
if
he
does
it
to
everybody
in
a
nondiscriminatory--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
just
in
effect
says,
everybody
knows
it's
farther,
but
this
is
a...
you
know,
it's
like
all
sorts
of
discount
deals
that
you
run
into.
i'm
most
of
the
way
there
by
then.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
might
save
him
a
lot
to
truck
in
findlay,
ohio,
too,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
works
in
the
bankrupt
carrier's
interest.
you
said
it
worked
against
the
carrier's
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see,
it
means
the
absence
of
the...
the
filed
rate
doctrine
is
what...
the
filed
rate
is
what
the
carrier
is
trying
to
enforce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
i
suppose
it
was
much
too
late
to
give
a
remedy
looking
to
the
future,
because
the
carrier
was
bankrupt,
or
out
of
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
something
that
enabled
them--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
is
looking
at
a
situation
when
that...
it's
much
too
late
to
order
that
particularly.
i'm
curious
to
know
about
the
significance
of
this
case.
i
had
the
impression
from
that
other
opinion
we're
talking
about
40
percent
of
this
package
of
litigation.
do
you
agree
with
the
estimate
it's
only
111
carriers
out
of
12,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
really
kind
of
a
fly
speck
in
the
whole
picture.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
were
directed
to
the
attention
of
page
35
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
treating
that
as
though
it
were
a
third
document
as
part
of
all
the
tariffs.
do
you
agree
that
that
is
a
tariff,
that
notice
has
the
same
presumptive
effect
in
the
sense
that
shippers
are
presumed
to
know
about
that
notice
just
as
they're
presumed
to
know
about
everything
in
the
filed
tariff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
230
out
of
12,000.
