mr.
paul
o.
taylor
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client,
security
services,
is
a
motor
common
carrier.
it
filed
a
tariff,
a
tariff
called
501-b,
submitted
it
to
the
icc,
the
icc
accepted
this
tariff,
it
put
their
stamp
on
it,
"received",
they
put
it
on
their
shelf,
and
it
was
there
for
the
public
to
use.
the
tariff
was
never
rejected,
it
wasn't
cancelled,
it
wasn't
suspended,
it
wasn't
set
aside,
it
was
never
challenged
until
my
client
exercised
its
statutory
rights
under
section
10761(a)
to
collect
the
filed
tariff
rates.
the
district--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--i
don't
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
wasn't
enforced.
the
fact
was
that
it
was
on
file
and
gave
notice
to
the
public
as
to
what
the
rate
is.
this
court
in
berwind,
berwind-white
coal
mining
v.
chicago
and
erie
railroad
in
1914
said
that
a
tariff,
while
arguably
lacking
some
of
the
formalistic
requirements
that
the
act
requires
and
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
might
require,
is
enforceable
if
it
is
received
with
no
objection
as
to
form
and
if
it
is
adequate
to
give
notice
to
the
public
of
the
rate.
this
tariff
disclosed
a
rate,
the
rates
were
not
stated
in
cents
per
mile,
but
they
were
determinative
on
getting
the
mileage.
the
tariff
said
you
go
to
this
mileage
guide
for
purposes
of
getting
a
mile
and
applying
this
rate.
it
contained
everything
essential
to
rate
a
shipment.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--no,
i
don't
believe
the
public
would
be
confused,
for
several
reasons,
if
i
might
elaborate.
first
of
all,
the
icc's
claimed
voiding
power
does
not
come
from
this
failure
to
be
listed
in
the
participating
carrier's
tariff.
the
icc's
claimed
voiding
power
comes
from
the
failure
to
give
a
power
of
attorney
to
the
publisher
of
the
guide.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
your
honor,
what
the
public
reads
is
a
tariff,
and
the
tariff
discloses
the
rate.
the
statute
does
not
require
a
mileage
guide,
the
statute
requires
disclosure
of
rates,
and
this
tariff,
this
501-b
tariff,
very
plainly
disclosed
what
the
rate
would
be
for
riss.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
what
happens
is,
there's
lots
of
tariffs
that
are
allowed
to
go
into
effect
with
defects.
this
court
acknowledged
it
in
davis
v.
portland
seed,
said
its
defects
are
inevitable,
and
if
there's
a
certain
defect,
what
do
you
look
to
if
you
have,
perhaps,
tariffs
that
conflict,
or
tariffs
that
might
be
partially
incomplete.
what
you
look
to
is
the
intent
of
the
framers,
and
what
is
the
disclo--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--i
don't
agree
that
the
rate's
not
valid,
justice
kennedy.
the
rate
is
still
contained
in
the
tariff,
and
let
us
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
were
not
permitted
to
use
this
distance
guide.
you
still
have
this
rate
sitting
out
there.
you
can
calculate
rates.
you
certainly
cannot
apply
the
tariff
without
having
a
distance,
but
a
mileage
is
not
something
that
is
abstract,
a
mileage
is
finite.
there
is
only
one
shortest,
practical
distance
from
chicago
to
minneapolis
or
from
baltimore
to
boston.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
have
a
bureau
do
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
during
this
time
period,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
allowing
all
sorts
of
methods
of
filing:
rand
mcnally
road
maps,
mileage
guides
that
weren't
on
file--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--that's
true.
i
believe
that
to
be
true.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
i
have
traveled
it
on
several
occasions.
i'm
more
familiar
with
the
distance
from
chicago
to
minneapolis
than
i
am
from
baltimore
to
washington,
but
by
the--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--no.
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--no,
justice
souter,
you
take
the
tariff
as
to
what
it
discloses,
and
this
tariff
disclosed
the
rate
dependent
upon
mileage,
the
charge,
the
derivative
charge,
and
that
said
we're
going
to
use
these
mileages.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
no.
no,
they
weren't,
justice
ginsburg.
mileage
guides
were
not
uniform,
but
there
was
only
one
mileage
guide
disclosed
by
my
client.
we
didn't
say,
we're
using
all
sorts
of
other
different
mileage
guides.
there
was
one
mileage
guide
that
our
holding
out
to
the
public
said
we
would
use.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
sure,
absolutely
they
could.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
because,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--because
the
public
would
know
from
the
rate
tariff.
when
you
rate
a
shipment,
and
what
the
reasonable
user
is
going
to
use
in
using
a
tariff
is,
they
are
going
to
open
this
tariff
and
they
are
going
to
see
this
is
the
rates
that
riss,
in
its
own
tariff,
not
in
the
tariff
filed
by
a
third
party
agent,
but
in
a
tariff
that
it
has
disclosed
to
the
public
saying
these
are
our
rates,
the
tariff
that's
circulated.
these
are
our
mileage
rates,
and
this
is
what
we
are
going
to
use.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
well,
justice
scalia,
the
fact
is
that
during
this
time
period,
the
icc
rules,
the
icc
had
issued
a
rule
in
1984
when
it
amended
the
tariff
publishing
regulations.
first
of
all,
what
they
did
was,
they
eliminated
from
that
section
of
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking...
it
originally
said,
if
you
refer
to
a
distance
guide,
you
have
to
also
provide
a
power
of
attorney
or
concurrence
in
that
distance
guide.
1)
that
was
deleted.
2)
the
icc
issued
an
opinion
called,
"revision
of
tariffs,
all
carriers.
"
when
they
made
a
complete
overhaul
of
its
rules,
and
it
said,
due
to
issues
of
copyright
and
general
availability,
we
will
no
longer
mandate
for
distance
guides
their
filing
with
the
commission
or
who
must
be
parties
to
it.
this
1312.4(d)
voiding
power
at
least
to
the
extent
the
commission
attempts
to
retroactively
apply
it
to
riss'
tariff
which
continued
in
effect
is
something
that
is
basically
newfound.
it's
not
something
that
any
reasonable
reader
of
those
regulations
would
have
determined
back
in
1984,
or
in
1985
at
the
time
riss
filed
the
tariff
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
the
dues
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg...
and
i'm
only
going
from
my
personal
knowledge
and
not
from
the
record...
were
about
$83
during
this
time
period.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
that
was
in
the
record
in
the
jasper
wyman
case,
a
portion
of
which
is
attached
to
amicus
overland's
brief
in
this
case.
in
fact,
during
this
time
period,
aside
from
40
percent
not
participating,
there
were
all
sorts
of
other
methods
which
were
disclosed,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
commission
was
made
aware
of
actual
violations,
they
did
nothing
to
strike
the
tariffs.
only--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
it
was
because
the
commission
had
basically
issued
this
decision
in
revision
of
tariffs
in
1984
that
said,
we
are
no
longer
going
to
require
filing
of
distance
guides,
and
we
are
not
going
to
require
participation
in
them.
the
commission
now
says,
well,
that
means
copyrighting
or
something
like
that,
but
i
think
the
unequivocal
language
of
that
decision
is...
and
i
can
quote
it
almost
verbatim...
is
due
to
issues
of
copyright
and
general
availability,
we
will
no
longer
mandate
for
distance
guides
their
filing
with
the
commission
or
participation
in
them.
at
least,
it's
language
very
similar
to
that,
so
i
think--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
riss
billed
their
tariff
rate,
and
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
bankruptcies,
i
know
there's
a
lot
of
these
cases
that
have
developed
their
way
up
through
the
system,
this
court
having
had
several
in
the
last
3
years.
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases,
the
carrier
bills
the
tariff
rate.
the
other
thing
in
this
case,
it's
not
a
matter
of
protecting
the
riss,
it's
a
matter
of
protecting
the
public
and
their
ability
to
challenge
rates
that
are
on
file.
there's
no
way,
if...
the
core
purpose
of
the
act
that
this
court
said
in
maislin
was
to
disclose
the
rate
and
allow
people
to
challenge
them
as
discriminatory
and
also
to
provide
stability
in
the
rate
by
allowing
the
commission's...
the
circuit
court's
application
of
the
commission
rule,
basically
what
the
court
would
be
saying
in
that
case
would
be
that
well,
you
can
negotiate
whatever
you
want,
and
if
your
tariff
is
somewhat
defective,
it
doesn't
meet
the
proper
form,
then,
well,
okay,
you
cannot
collect
it.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
first
of
all,
the
application
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine
has
never
been
dependent
on
somebody
being
in
bankruptcy.
it's
not
just
my
client's
right
to
collect
its
tariff
charge,
it's
my
client's
duty,
whether
bankrupt
or
not
bankrupt,
to
collect
the
tariff
charges,
so
by
that
same
token
the
liability
for
the
shipper
exists
whether
or
not
we
actually
make
the
demand
for
payment.
they
are
charged
with
knowledge
of
what
is
contained
in
the
tariff.
on
top
of
it--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--not
only
could
they
have,
they
should
have,
and
were
required
to
by
the
act
to
bring
that
action.
congress
has
mandated
the
collection
of--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--solvent
carriers
bring
these
types
of
actions
not
as
frequently
as
bankrupt
carriers.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
recently?
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
solvent
carriers...
yes,
i
have
several
carriers
who
i
represent
who
have
brought
actions
for
undercharges.
for
example...
and
i
know
many
people
who
are
engaged
in
the
collection
business,
when
a
client
comes
in
and
says,
i
want
to
collect
payment
from
a
particular
shipper--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--yes,
in
that
setting.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
not
that
i'm
aware...
not
recently.
in
the
past,
yes,
but
not
recently
that
i'm
aware
of.
i
think
what
happens
in
a
case
such
as
this
is
that
what
the
interstate
commerce
commission
advocates
through
its
rules
and
through
its
newfound
interpretation
of
its
regulation
is
that
somehow
that
there
should
be
a
punishment
upon
riss
for
not
filing
this
power
of
attorney
and
remembering
that
the
voiding
power
does
not
come
from
not
being
listed
in
the
tariff,
the
voiding
power
comes
from
not
providing
the
power
of
attorney.
but
the
act
is
there
to
protect
the
public,
and
it's
there
to
protect
the
core
purpose
there,
being
able
to
challenge
a
filed
rate
as
discriminatory,
as
unduly
preferential
and
perhaps
unreasonable
under
some
of
the
other
criteria
in
the
act,
and
it's
really
the
public
interest
that's
being
protected.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
yes,
justice--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--not
in
recent
years.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
part
of
it--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--well,
the
fact
is
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
not
reach
the
issue
of
reasonableness
any
more.
they
have
not
yet
that
i'm
aware
of
actually
issued
a
dispositive
ruling
ever
determining
whether
or
not
a
rate
is
reasonable
or...
unreasonable.
they
basically
have
adopted
a
hands-off
approach,
and
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
futile
for
a
shipper
to
make
a
challenge
to
a
rate
as
unduly
discriminatory
because
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
allowed
all
sorts
of
rates
that
are
discriminatory
and
it
hasn't,
that
i'm
aware
of,
actually
issued
an
order
finding
that
a
rate
might
be
discriminatory.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
yes.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
it
goes
away.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
but
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
the
riss
501-b
tariff
continued
to
be
on
the
shelf,
continued
to
be
charged
to
people
other
than
k
mart,
and
it
was
there
for
the
public
to
view
to
see
and
to
challenge
if
they
wanted
to.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
no,
the
rule
is
authorized.
the
rule
is
proper,
but
the
application
of
the
rule
to
have
an
effect
saying
this
tariff
that
was
on
the
shelf
since
1984,
we
should
pretend
does
not
exist
and
should
give
no
legal
effect
to
it,
that
is
contrary
to
law.
it
runs
contrary
to
this
court's
precedent
in
maislin,
it
runs
contrary
to
this
court's
precedent
in
berwind.
tariffs
don't
have
to
be
perfect.
they
frequently
aren't.
a
part
of
the
problem
is,
frankly,
lack
of
oversight
by
the
commission,
for
whatever
reason.
part
of
the
problem
is
the
commission
has
shortened
the
time
period
for
filing
tariffs.
statutorily,
they
can
shorten
it
to
less
than
30
days,
so
you
can
decrease
a
rate,
now,
on
1
day
notice,
you
can
increase
it
on
7
days'
notice.
that
certainly
doesn't
give
the
commission
time
to
go
through
it
and
say,
hey,
there's
something
wrong
with
your
tariff.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
well,
it's
affected
through
what's
called
a
participating
carrier's
tariff,
so
what
you
have
to
do
is,
you
have
to
start
with
the
riss
tariff,
which
says
it's
governed
by
the
mileage
guide
and
only
by
the
mileage
guide,
and
then
you
go
from
the
mileage
guide,
which
says
this
only
applies
for
people
listed
in
tariff
107,
so
you
make
a
two-step
removal
from
riss'
tariff
to
see
who's
listed.
then
there's
supplements
that
come
out
from
time
to
time
that
the
household
goods
tariff
bureau
would
publish,
which
show
through
symbolization
riss's
name
being
stricken
and
all
sorts
of
other
carriers
being
stricken
from
the
tariff,
but
the
commission
hasn't
gotten
to
the
point
to
where
they
go
back
and
cancel
riss'
here.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
yes,
that's
exactly
correct.
the
fact
is...
and
i
think
the
principal
point
in
a
case
such
as
this,
however,
is
that
what
is
the
disclosed
rate?
what
does
the
statute
require?
the
statute
requires
us
to
file
rates,
it
doesn't
require
us
to
file
mileages.
you
can
determine
mileages
without
having
a
mileage
guide.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission's
own
regulations
at
49
c.f.r.
part
1048,
when
referring
to
what
are
called
commercial
zones,
refers
to
airline
miles
around
a
particular
city,
which
would
require
some
sort
of
external
measurement,
so
the
tariffs
don't
require
precision.
what
it
requires
disclosure
of
rates
in
such
a
fashion
that
would
enable
somebody
to
challenge
the
rates
as
discriminatory
or
unreasonable.
one
thing
this
court
cited
with
approval
in
the
maislin
case
was
the
regular
common
carrier
conference
case
by
the
d.c.
circuit
decided
in
1986.
in
that
case,
the
commission
had
put
forth
a
rule
which
basically
said,
you
can
put
in
your
tariff,
or
actually
a
group
of
carriers
had
published
a
rule
which
says,
you
can
negotiate
whatever
you
want
to.
that
was
in
the
tariff.
that
is
basically
the
sum
and
substance
of
what
was
said,
and
it
was
challenged
by
a
group
of
carriers
which
said,
that
doesn't
meet
the
requirement
for
a
rate
in
the
tariff,
and
the
d.c.
circuit
said,
that
requirement
is
utterly
central
to
the
act,
and
the
commission
came
back
and
said,
well,
we
have
all
these
other
methods
of
determining
tariff
rates.
and
what
the
d.c.
circuit
said
is
that
while
those
tariffs
haven't
been
challenged
yet,
what
they
said...
and
this
is
from
page
380,
793
fed
2d
380...
for
example,
under
volume
discount
rules,
competing
carriers
cannot
determine
the
per
unit
rate,
but
the
carrier
is
charged
with
knowing
the
volume
tendered
by
the
shipper,
but
they
do
at
least
know
how
the
per
unit
rate
is
determined,
enabling
them
to
protest
the
application
of
a
different
formula
to
a
particular
shipper.
so
if
for
some
reason
some
shipper
took
that
extraordinary
step
and
went
two
tariffs
removed
from
riss'
tariff
and
was
somehow
confused
about
the
mileages,
at
least
we
have
a
disclosed
rate
and
a
method
of
challenging
that
rate
and
perhaps
challenging
the
application
of
that
rate
for
a
calculation
of
mileages
in
that
case.
and
by
the
circuit
court's
opinion,
by
upholding
the
retroactive
effect
of
1312.4(d),
they
basically
got
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
it
makes
the
disclosed
rate
unreliable,
and
this
court
has
said
in
berwind,
said
it
in
davis
v.
portland
seed,
that
that
disclosed
rate,
that
the
carriers
at
a
certain
point
have
to
be
able
to
place
repose
in
the
tariffs
that
are
on
file.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
that's
correct.
from
that
date
forward,
from
the
date
after
riss
was
dropped
from
the
list
of
participating
carriers,
those
shippers
who
relied
on
that
tariff,
the
501-b
tariff
that
riss
filed
in
its
own
name,
those
shippers
that
relied
on
it,
paid
that
rate,
at
that
point
that
tariff
becomes
retroactively
voided
for
them
and
basically
leaves
us
with
no
tariff.
the
additional
application
of
the
rule,
while
not
present
in
this
case,
but
the
record
attached
to
overland's
brief,
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
overland
in
this
case,
indicates
that
you
can
have
the
reverse
effect.
in
american
trucking,
all
you
had
was
a
restoration
to
a
cheaper
rate,
but
if
you
void...
if
the
commission
is
allowed
to
void
carriers'
rates,
it
may...
it
doesn't
in
this
case,
but
it
may
in
other
cases
and
does
in
other
cases,
result
in
higher
rates,
so
the--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--there
is
no
right.
nobody
can
claim
a
right
to
a
rate
that
has
expired.
in
this
case,
the
rate
tariff
continued
on
file,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
no.
well,
in
those
cases,
1)--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
case
where
there
is
no
otherwise
applicable
rate,
there
would
be
no
tariff
and
the
carrier
would
be
subject
to
whatever
civil
penalty...
the
civil
penalties
under
the
act,
because
the
act
does
require
you
to
maintain
rates
in
other
cases.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
the
carrier
can
always
charge,
and
must
always
charge
his
tariff
rate.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
if
you
had
no
tariff
rate
at
all,
in
any
tariff,
not
just
the
501-b
tariff,
but
if
there
was
no
other
tariff
applicable
that
might
be
higher
or
lower,
now
at
that
point
you
would...
i
assume
you
would
have
an
illegal
contract
and
nobody
would
be
entitled
to
any
compensation.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
i
agree,
yes.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
i--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--no.
well,
there's
a
split
of
case
law
among
the
district
courts.
some
say
that
a
carrier
is
entitled
to
a
quantum
meruit
recovery,
other
cases
say,
well,
the
rates
are
determined
on
the
tariff,
and
if
you
have
no
tariff
you
have
no
rate
and
thus
there's
nothing
to
collect,
and
assuming
if
you
pay
the
negotiated
rate
you
might
leave
the
parties
in
the
position
as
you
find
them,
but
that
is
assuming,
again,
you
have
no
rate.
in
this
case
there
was
a
disclosed
rate,
and
the
operation
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
such
that
it
makes
that
disclosed
rate
unreliable,
and
anybody
who
looked
at
it,
relied
on
it,
paid
it,
could
be
penalized
either
up
or
down,
as
a
matter--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
well,
there
are
certain
civil
forfei
ure
penalties.
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
act
are
outlined
at
section
11901
through
11904.
at
that
point,
one
would
assume
that
they
would
be
liable
for
charging
something
that's
discriminatory,
because
who
knows
what
they
would
be
charging
in
that
case.
there's
criminal
and
civil
penalties
that
would
provide
up
to...
i
believe
the
criminal
penalties
under
the
act
are
2
years
in
jail
and
$10,000
per
violation,
and
it's
been
construed
that
the
violation
is
on
a
shipment-by-shipment
basis.
but
if
i
can
leave
with
one
point,
and
that
is
that
there's
never
been
a
requirement
of
tariff
perfection.
the
question
is,
what
is
the
public
likely
to
see,
what
are
their
rights,
and
how
do
you
justify
them
in
this
case?
how
do
we
vindicate
the
public
rights?
that
is,
upholding
the
disclosed
rate,
not
allowing
a
negotiated
rate
to
stand.
that's
the
core
purpose
that
this
court
stressed
in
maislin.
maislin
cited
american
trucking
for
the
proposition
that
while
the
commission
can
craft
appropriate
remedies,
it
cannot
do
something
that
undermines
the
core
purpose
of
the
act,
and
by
stating,
because
this
tariff
has
some
sort
of
pimple
or
technical
imperfection,
it
should
be
totally
treated
as
void,
and
a
negotiated
rate
should
stand,
really
does
undermine
the
intent
of
congress.
thank
you
very
much.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
voiding
power
that
the
commission
claims
doesn't
come
from
failure
to
be
listed
in
the
tariff,
it
comes
from
the
failure
to
provide
a
private
power
of
attorney,
failure
to
provide
it
to
the
publisher
of
the
distance
guide,
and
the
commissioner
has
said
those
documents
are
no
longer
used
by
us.
that's
where
the
voiding
power
comes
from,
so
at
the
time...
now,
they
say,
well,
it
only
comes...
the
government
says,
well,
it
only
comes
about
when
you
cancel
your
participation.
well,
that's
simply
not
the
case.
they
claim
it
comes--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--well,
that
is
not,
however,
what
the
regulation
says.
the
reg--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--justice
souter,
you
can't
possibly
know,
because
the
powers
of
attorney
are
never
filed.
when
we
don't
know...
this
power
of
attorney
that
riss
had
has
disappeared.
there
was
a
search
made
for
it,
and
it's
disappeared.
we
don't
know
when
it
actually
was
cancelled.
we
don't
know...
this
is
a
carrier
that
is
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
we
don't
know
if
in
fact
they
never
did
pay
their
fee,
but
one
thing
we
know
is
that
this
tariff,
the
501-b,
continued
on
the
shelf.
when
a
tariff
is
cancelled,
the
icc
physically
removes
it
from
the
shelf.
this
tariff
remained
on
the
shelf.
with
regard
to--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--it
is
a
tariff.
indeed,
it
is.
with
respect
to
the
proceeding
to
cancel
the
111
tariffs,
the
commission
hasn't
said
that's
a
show
cause
proceeding
to
state,
why
shouldn't
we
cancel
them?
well,
if
they
are
void
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
really
is
no
reason
to
cancel
them.
you
just
take
them
off
the
shelf.
they
have
allowed
the
opportunity
to
remedy
that
situation,
recognizing
that
the
tariffs
that
refer
to
it
are
still
on
the
shelf,
still
relied
on
by
the
parties.
in
addition,
this
111
is
just
a
starting
number.
there
is
record
in
the
jasper
wyman
proceeding
that
was
attached
to
overland's
brief
that
said
on
page...
their
appendix
page
8
of
the
amicus
brief,
affidavit
by
don
norman,
"as
an
example,
a
study
of
filings
for
the
months
of
april
and
may
1991.
"
--a
2-month
period...
with
the
commission,
shows
that
more
than
230
carriers
filed
tariffs
that
contained
rates
which
referenced
the
household
goods
mileage
guide
as
a
methodology
for
determining
miles
applicable
to
those
rates.
these
publications
have
been
accepted
and
passed
to
the
tariff
files
without
criticism
or
rejection
by
the
icc.
they
simply
did
not
enforce
it.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
that
continues
on.
they
were
not
participants.
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
yes,
even
though
they
did
not...
that's
230,
justice
stevens
in
a
2-month
period.
that's
what
that
is.
the
commission
during
this
time
period
was
simply
not
enforcing
this
regulation.
the
other
issue
that
we
have
to
deal
with
is,
assume
that--
mr.
paul
o.
taylor
--yes.
yes,
they
do.
well,
the
actual
shipping
transactions
came
up
pre-maislin.
the
question
you
deal
with,
now
you
have...
assuming
their
argument
is
right,
and
you
can't
use
the
mileage
guide,
does
that
mean
you
have
an
incomplete
tariff?
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
says
you
have
to
have
miles,
a
booklet
of
miles
in
order
to
determine
mileages.
the
same
way
mr.
augello
talked
about
being
able
to
manipulate
mileages,
you
can
manipulate
weight.
you
have
rates
that
are
in
cubic
feet.
you
can
manipulate
that.
there's
all
sorts
of
things
that
you
can
manipulate
that
would
be
illegal,
but
a
mile
is
something
that's
finite.
this
court
said,
in
a
case
called
hewitt
robbins
v.
eastern
freightways
in
1962,
that
a
shipper
is
entitled
to
receive
the
rate
over
the
cheapest
route
available.
there's
nothing
that
says
tariffs
have
to
be
perfect.
if
we
can't
use
the
mileage
guide,
if
you
determine
somehow
that
this
reference
was
illegal,
you
still
have
this
tariff
that
continued
to
be
on
the
shelf
that
people
continued
to
rely
on.
by
treating
that
tariff
as
void,
by
putting
blinders
on
and
saying,
that
tariff
was
there
and
accepted,
nobody
ever
challenged
is
nonexistent,
well
then,
of
course,
you're
doing
what
maislin
says
you
shouldn't
do.
you're
allowing
a
negotiated
rate
to
supersede
a
tariff
that
may
have
some
imperfections,
but
a
tariff
that
disclosed
a
rate
that
the
public
relied
on.
thank
you
very
much.
