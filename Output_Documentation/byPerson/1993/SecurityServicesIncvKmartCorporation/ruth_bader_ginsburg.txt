you
had
one
guide,
and
there
were
other
guides
that
gave
different
distances
between
the
same
two
points,
were
there
not?
there
was
a
choice.
you
could
have
filed
a
map,
you
could
have
joined
this
guide,
you
could
have
joined
another
guide,
and
they
weren't
uniform,
were
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
much
were
the
dues
involved
that
weren't
paid
that
led
to
riss
not
being
a
party
to
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
anything
that
accounts
for
how
widespread
this
failure
to
continue
to
be
members
of
the
guide
were,
because
i
think
one
figure
in
the
record
was
that
between
the
years
1984
and
1988,
40
percent
of
the
common
carriers
weren't
paying
their
dues.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
this
because
everybody
was
really
making
deals
outside
the
tariff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
at
the
time
riss...
the
prebankruptcy
riss
didn't
have
a
whole
lot
of
interest
in
adherence
to
this
tariff,
because
in
fact
you
were
making
deals
for
a
price
lower
than
the
tariff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
understand
what
your
argument
is
now
in
collecting
from
customers
who
paid
less,
but
suppose
there
had
been
no
bankruptcy,
could
riss
have
gone
after
the
people
that
it
gave
discount
rates
to,
or
would
there
have
been
some
kind
of
estoppel
working
prebankruptcy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
of
these
cases
seeking
more
from
customers
who
were
given
discounted
rates
come
up
in
the
context
of
a
bankruptcy?
suppose
there
had
been
no
bankruptcy.
you
made
a
deal
with
customers
and
said,
forget
the
tariff,
we
are
going
to
give
you
a
better
price,
because
there's
competition
out
there,
and
then
2
months
later
you
say,
sorry,
we
were
entitled,
because
of
our
filed
rate,
to
charge
you
more,
so
we're
going
to
send
you
an
additional
bill.
would
there
have
been
some
kind
of
estoppel
operating
prebankruptcy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
is
determination
shown?
if
someone
looks
at
the
guide,
they
just
looked
at
the
mileage
from
x
point
to
y
point,
they
wouldn't
see
anything,
but
the
names
of
the
people...
how
was
that...
when
riss
dropped
out,
when
it
didn't
pay
the
$83,
how
was
notice
of
that
conveyed
to
the
shipping
world?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be
in
a
different
booklet
than
the
mileage
guide
itself,
the
list
of
people
who
haven't
paid
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
carrier
is
acting
unlawfully
if
it
has
no
filed
rate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
penalties,
apart
from
what
the
shipper
would
owe?
what
are
the
penalties
for
not
having
an
operative
filed
rate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it...
i
suppose,
as
your
opposing
counsel
said,
a
separate
publication?
if
i
wanted
to
ship
goods,
i
know
what
the
rate
is,
and
i
want
to
see
what
the
mileage
is.
i
look
at
the
mileage
guide,
but
to
find
out
whether
riss
is
still
a
party
to
that
household
goods,
i
have
to
look
at
yet
a
third
book?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
pick
up
the...
if
you
just
pick
up
the
rate,
you
can
pick
up
the
mileage
book
and
stop
there,
then
you
don't
know
that
riss
is
no
longer
paying
its
$83
a
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
assuming
someone
would
get
that
book
and
look
at
it,
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
word,
"participate"
means
nothing
more
than
pay
your
annual
dues
to
belong
to
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
just
asking
what
participate
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
gets
listed
by
filing
the
power
of
attorney
and
paying
annual
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
nothing
else
beyond
that.
participation
doesn't
mean
anything
fancier
than--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--subscribe
and
pay
your
annual
fee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
why
it
is
that
the
discontinuance
was
so
widespread,
so
many
carriers
stopped
paying
their
annual
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
can
go
back
to
my
question,
i
think
your
answer
was
that
the
percentage
was
in
fact
a
lot
lower,
but
111
is
still
a
significant
number
dealing
with
a
rule
of
the
commission
that
says
one
must
have
a
filed
rate,
and
to
have
this
rate
complete
we
need
two
parts,
the
rate
and
the
distance.
is
there
any
explanation
why
111
carriers,
knowing
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
simply
didn't
pay
the
$83?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
manning,
the
chief
justice's
question
brings
up
something
that
has...
seems
to
me
to
underlie
this
whole
matter.
you've
done
a
very
good
job
of
telling
us
why
a
component
of
the
rate
has
not
been
filed,
but
the
question
is,
what
should
the
consequence
of
that
be,
and
the
icc
says
the
cornerstone
of
this
whole
thing
is
the
filed
rate.
then
there's
an
absence,
an
incomplete
aspect
of
this
tariff,
and
instead
of
saying,
carrier,
you
make
that
tariff
complete,
you
pay
your
$83,
it
says,
well,
then,
all
bets
are
off,
and
we
have
no
filed
rate,
when
the
filed
rate
is
supposed
to
be
so
important.
it's
your
solution
to
say,
we
get
rid
of
the
filed
rate,
instead
of,
if
you
are
true
to
that
the
filed
that
is
fundamental
to
this
whole
regime,
like
it
or
not,
to
say,
measure
up.
do
what's
necessary
to
have
a
filed
rate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
may
i
ask
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
this
very
situation
the
commission
didn't
say,
if
it
is
indeed
saying
the
filed
rate
is
it,
didn't
say,
when
such...
when
we
detect
such
a
thing,
then
we
require
the
carrier
to
join,
pay
all
the
back
dues,
and
slap
a
penalty
on
them.
wouldn't
that
be
the
most
effective
way,
if
what
we
were
genuinely
concerned
about
was
maintaining
the
filed
rate,
instead
of
saying,
well,
they
didn't
comply,
therefore
we
allow
the
secret
rates
to
operate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
are
supporting
the
result
that
says,
you
missed
your
$83
so
all
bets
are
off
and
the
privately
negotiated
rate
is
what
sticks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
of
the
relevant
events
in
this
case
come
up
pre-maislin.
