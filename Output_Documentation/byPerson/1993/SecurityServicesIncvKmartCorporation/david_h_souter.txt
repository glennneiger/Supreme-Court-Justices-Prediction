justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
take
the
position
that
there
was
something
unreasonable
beyond
the
statutory
power
on
the
icc
to
require
the
filing
of
the
mileage
guide,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
we
then
have
to
take
tariff
as
meaning
what
the
icc
has
construed
it
to
mean
to
require
both
the
mileage
rate
and
the
mileage
distance
specification?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
government...
it
only
comes
about
effectively
when
notice
is
given
to
the
public.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
way
it
works
in
practice?
i
mean,
do
you
know
of
any
instance
in
which
the
rule
has
been
evoked
with
respect
to
any
carriage
prior
to
the
time
of
the
filing
so
that
the
public
could
find
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
have
the
opinion
to
announce
in
the
case
of
security
services
against
kmart,
no.
93-284.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
motor
carrier
in
bankruptcy
may
recover
for
undercharges
based
on
tariff
rates
that
have
void
as
a
matter
of
law
or
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
regulations.
a
milage
rate
tariff
has
two
components:
charges
per
mile
and
stated
distance.
the
milage
rate
tariff
that
petitioner,
security
services
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
did
not
list
distances
for
calculating
charges
for
shipments
but
instead
relied
on
a
milage
guide
filed
by
the
household
goods
carriers'
bureau.
the
milage
guide
states
that
it
may
not
be
used
to
determine
rates
unless
the
carrier
is
shown
as
a
participant
in
the
guide.
participants
are
listed
in
a
separate
tariff
filed
with
the
icc.
when
security
services
failed
to
pay
its
participation
fees,
the
bureau
canceled
security
services'
participation
by
publishing
a
supplement
to
its
tariff
which
listed
participants.
sometime
later,
security
services
contracted
with
respondent,
kmart
corporation
to
transport
kmart's
goods
at
contract
rates
below
its
filed
tariff
rates.
security
services
later
filed
for
bankruptcy
and,
as
debtor
in
possession,
invoked
the
icc
or
the
interstate
commerce
act?s
filed
rate
doctrine
which
mandates
that
carriers
charge
and
be
paid
the
rates
filed
in
the
tariff.
security
services,
therefore,
claimed
that
kmart
was
liable
for
undercharges
based
on
the
difference
between
the
contract
and
tariff
rates.
kmart
refused
to
pay
and
security
services
sued.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
kmart
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
second
conflict
over
the
enforceability
of
the
icc
void
for
non-participation
regulation
and
we
now
affirm.
icc
regulations
invalidate
a
milage-based
tariff
upon
cancelation
of
the
carrier's
participation
in
an
agent's
distance
guide,
as
occurred
here.
such
a
tariff
is
incomplete
and
seizes
to
satisfy
the
fundamental
purpose
of
tariffs
which
is
to
disclose
the
freight
charge
due
to
the
carrier.
a
carrier
employing
distance
rates
without
being
bound
by
state
of
distances
would
be
just
as
well
placed
to
discriminate
among
shippers
by
measuring
with
rubber
instruments
as
it
would
be
by
charging
shippers
for
a
state
of
distance
at
mutable
rates
per
mile.
security
services
makes
two
main
arguments,
neither
of
which
is
availing.
it
argues
that
the
regulation
operates
retroactively
but
that
is
not
the
case.
under
a
regulation,
security
services'
tariff
reference
to
the
milage
guide
became
void
as
a
matter
of
law
and
its
tariff
filing
is
incomplete
on
the
phase
when
the
bureau
canceled
its
participation
in
the
guide.
the
transactions
with
kmart
occurred
after
that
date.
equally
inept
is
security
services'
reliance
on
the
technical
defect
rule.
under
our
cases,
neither
procedural
irregularity
nor
unreasonableness
nullifies
a
filed
rate.
but
a
tariff
like
this
one
that
refers
to
another
tariff
for
essential
information
which
tariff
in
turn
states
that
the
carrier
may
not
refer
to
it
does
not
provide
the
adequate
notice
of
rates
to
be
charged
that
the
court's
technical
defects
cases
require.
the
trustee
and
bankruptcy
and
debtors
in
possession
may
rely
on
the
filed
rate
doctrine
to
collect
for
undercharges
but
they
may
not
collect
for
undercharges
based
on
filed
but
void
rates.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
thomas
and
justice
ginsburg
have
each
filed
dissenting
opinions.
