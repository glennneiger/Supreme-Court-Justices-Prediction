well,
if
the
shipper
had
read
the
guide
and
seen
the
asterisk,
then
he
would
have
known
that
the
rate
should
not
be
enforced--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
this
wasn't
a
defect
in
a
calculation,
it
was
a
failure
of
a
condition
that
must
continue
for
the
rate
to
be
valid,
and
that
condition
failed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
that's
so,
why
is
it
so
complicated
to
have
all
these
distances
that
you
have
to
have
a
bureau
do
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
when
you
say,
retroactive,
this
was
not
retroactive
so
that
it
voided
the
tariff
before
the
date
of
the
supplement
to
the
rating
bureau.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
not...
it's
retroactive
only
in
the
conclusory
sense
that
you
say
that
the
rating
bureau
publication
is
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
you
going
to
attempt
to
address
the
retroactivity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
or
disagree
that
the
publication
of
the
household
goods
100
is
a
tariff?
