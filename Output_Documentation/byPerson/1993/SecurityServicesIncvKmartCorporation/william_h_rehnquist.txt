we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
93-284,
security
services,
inc.
v.
the
k
mart
corporation.
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
never
enforced
during
the
time
that
the
actual
carrier
had
it,
whatever
its
validity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
in
fact
true
that
it's
very
obvious...
to
washington
to
baltimore,
that
it's
very
obvious
there's
one
and
only
one
shortest
practical
route?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
you
traveled
it
often?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
in
addition,
to
answer
justice
ginsburg's...
that
riss
could
have
brought
this
action
had
no
bankruptcy
supervened?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
taylor,
what
happens
in
the
case
of
a
rate
which
has
passed
its
expiration
date?
it
remains
on
file,
but
it's
no
longer
valid?
what
are
the
rights
of
the
carrier
and
the
shipper
in
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
that
case,
the
shipper
and
the
carrier
could
negotiate
their
own
deal,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
you've
said
no
rate
applies,
so
wouldn't
the
only
alternative
be
for
the
carrier
and
the
shipper
to
negotiate
their
own
deal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
by
hypothesis,
you
haven't
maintained
rates,
and
you've
made
a
deal
with
the
shipper
to
ship
at
a
particular
price.
is
that
voidable,
or
can
the
carrier
come
back
and
charge
more
later?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
by
hypothesis
we
have
no--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
that
the
carrier
would
be
carrying
for
nothing,
in
effect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
a
remarkably
harsh
result.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
taylor.
mr.
augello.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
your
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
percentage
was
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
apropos
of
a
comment
you
made
a
moment
ago,
mr.
augello,
in
your
view,
would
it
be
permissible,
or
have
been,
for
a
carrier
to
file
a
mileage
guide
that
said
the
distance
from
new
york
to
chicago
is
300
miles
so
long
as
he
did
that
with
every
single
shipper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--300
miles
from
new
york
to
chicago,
which,
you
know,
is
very
optimistic.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
augello.
mr.
manning,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
manning--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
last
sentence
of
1312.4
on
page
3a
of
the
appendix
of
your
brief
says,
"should
a
challenge
to
a
tariff
be
made
on
this
basis,
carriers
will
be
required
to
submit
the
necessary
proof.
"
"what
sort
of
a
challenge
would
be
made
by
a
carrier
on
that
basis?
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
sentence
says
carriers
shall
submit
the
necessary
proof.
that
suggests
to
me
that
it's
a
carrier...
that
a...
would
be
challenging
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manning.
mr.
taylor,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taylor.
the
case
is
submitted.
