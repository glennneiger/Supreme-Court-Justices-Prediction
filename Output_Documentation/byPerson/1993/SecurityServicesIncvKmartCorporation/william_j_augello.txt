mr.
william
j.
augello
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sole
issue
in
this
court
today
is
whether
or
not
riss
had
an
effective
tariff.
i
think
the
court
has
identified
that
problem,
and
i
would
like
to
refer
you
to
the
principal
source
of
the
cancellation
of
the
tariff.
now,
you
will
find
a
copy
of
the
note
in
the
household
goods
mileage
guide
at
joint
appendix
35.
that
note
clearly
says
that
"this
mileage
guide
may
not
be
employed
by
a
carrier
as
a
governing
publication
for
the
purpose
of
determining
transportation
rates
based
on
mileage
or
distance
unless
the
carrier
is
shown
as
a
participant
in
the
above-named
tariff.
"
riss
was
once
a
party
to
that
carrier...
to
that
tariff,
and
so
its
rates
were
complete
when
they
initially
filed
the
riss
501
tariff.
that's
the
rate
tariff.
they
paid
their
dues
until
1985,
when
they
decided
to
stop.
it's
irrelevant
how
much
the
dues
were,
because
under
the
filed
rate
doctrine
the
carrier's
name
must
be
in
every
tariff
that
it
publishes.
in
1985,
as
i
said,
it
stopped
paying.
the
household
goods
mileage
bureau
duly
cancelled
riss
from
the
tariff
by
filing
a
cancellation
supplement.
that
supplement
is
a
tariff.
the
tariff
is
notice
to
the
world
that
riss
is
no
longer
a
party
to
this
tariff.
mr.
william
j.
augello
that's
correct.
that's
not
a
problem.
mr.
william
j.
augello
but
the
point
is
that
it
really
is
irrelevant
whether
you
pick
up
the
tariff
or
not,
because
carriers
and
shippers
alike
are
charged
with
constructive
notice
of
every
duly
filed
tariff,
and
that
i
think
is
the
problem
that
we
ran
into
in
the
overland
case
when
the
court
did
not
duly
apply
that
principle.
they
were
talking
about,
well,
did
the
shipper
really
check
the
tariff,
did
the
shipper
really
check
to
see
if
the
power
of
attorney
was
executed?
it's
irrelevant.
mr.
william
j.
augello
that
is
incorrect.
mr.
william
j.
augello
it
is.
in
the
jasper
wyman
case
at
page
252
the
commission
addressed
that
contention
and
said...
first
of
all,
i'm
afraid
that
mr.
taylor
did
not
quote
the
language
in
that
1984
revision
of
tariffs
regulation
because...
he
didn't
quote
it
correctly.
this
is
what
the
commission
said...
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
252
of
the
jasper
wyman
case.
that
the
commission
would
not
"mandate
for
distance
guides
who
must
be
parties,
or
icc
filing
of
the
publication.
"
what
the
commission
was
saying
is,
we're
not
going
to
mandate
that
any
publisher
of
a
mileage
guide
must
file
their
tariff
with
the
commission
because
of
copyright
problems,
and
the
commission
went
on
to
say
the
commission
meant
simply
that
because
of
the
pending
copyright
litigation
involving
the
right
to
author
a
mileage
guide,
it
would
not
preclude
any
author
from
filing
a
mileage
guide
with
the
commission
nor
deny
any
carrier's
right
to
participate
in
any
filed
mileage
guide.
that
clarifies
the
situation.
the
note
at
page
joint
appendix
35
acts
like
a
stop
sign.
it
requires
the
tariff
reader
to
stop,
don't
go
any
further
until
you
see
whether
or
not
the
carrier
is
listed
in
household
goods
tariff
number
107--
mr.
william
j.
augello
--no,
your
honor.
section
1312.27(e)
of
the
commission's
regulations
state
clearly
that
if
a
carrier
refers
to
another
tariff,
it
must
participate
in
that
tariff.
mr.
william
j.
augello
means?
it
means
be
listed
as
a
participating
carrier.
mr.
william
j.
augello
precisely.
mr.
william
j.
augello
no.
that's
all
it
means.
mr.
william
j.
augello
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
augello
yes.
i'd
be
happy
to
address
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
estimate
that
you
read
in
the
overland
case
is
completely
unreliable.
there
is
absolutely
no
factual
basis
for
that
estimate.
i
tracked
it
down
and
found
that
it
came
from
a
newspaper
interview
of
the
president
of
the
household
goods
mileage
guide
who
said,
i
estimate
that
approximately
40
percent
of
the
carriers
that
refer
to
my
tariff
are
not
parties
to
it.
when
the
household
goods
mileage
people
finally
realized
what
was
going
on...
a
lot
of
people
were
using
their
tariff
without
paying
for
it...
they
filed
a
petition
with
the
icc.
you'll
see
the
citation
at
page
20
of
our
brief,
in
footnote
8.
it's
the
household
goods
carriers
bureau
petition
for
cancellation
of
tariffs
of
nonparticipating
carriers.
when
they
filed
that
petition,
they
found
only
111
carriers
that
were
not
party
to
the
tariff,
that
had
referred
to
the
tariff
in
their
own
rate
tariff,
but
didn't
participate.
mr.
william
j.
augello
well,
there's
prob...
i
think
there
are
12,800
carriers
listed
in
the
household
goods...
that's
the
figure
that
i
recall
from
the
commission's
brief
in
the
overland
case,
so
111
carriers.
that
was
a
complete
fabrication.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
riss
originally
was
a
party
to
the
tariff,
and
so
its
rates
were
once
legal.
they
were
once
complete,
but
when
you
publish
a
mileage
rate,
it
isn't
just
one
rate,
it
is
a
combination
of
a
mileage
rate
and
distances.
the
reason
the
commission
requires
the
publication
of
distance
is
to
prevent
discrimination,
because
if
you
don't
do
that,
one
carrier
could
say
to
a
favored
shipper,
between
new
york
and
chicago
we'll
call
it
1,000
miles.
for
another
shipper,
it
will
be
1
mile
less.
you
see,
these
distances
do
not
operate
on
actual
miles,
or
even
actual
traveled
miles,
or
even
the
shortest
distance.
it's
whatever
the
carrier
decides
is
going
to
be
the
basis
for
his
mileage,
and
then
he
must
stick
to
it.
he
cannot--
mr.
william
j.
augello
--beginning
in
1980,
congress
decided
to
open
the
doors
up
to
trucking,
and
the
commission's
certificates,
authorized
carriers,
suddenly
jumped
from
about
15,000
to
35,000.
there
were
a
lot
of
owner-operators
running
their
own
trucks
who
never
heard
of
the
icc
before,
and
they
suddenly
got
saddled
with
these
tariff
regulations,
and
you
know,
it
was
just
a
complete
breakdown
of
the
former
method
of
formalized
tariffs
and
everybody
knew
what
they
were
doing.
there
were
a
lot
of
people
in
the
business
who
didn't
know
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
william
j.
augello
exactly.
mr.
william
j.
augello
exactly.
mr.
william
j.
augello
that's
right,
but
the
shippers
who
were
in
good
faith
negotiating
these
rates
with
carriers,
believing
that
the
carrier
was
in
full
compliance
with
his
tariffs,
are
now
being
saddled
with
these
billions
of
dollars
of
undercharges.
mr.
william
j.
augello
yes.
see,
that's
one
of
the
options
he
has.
the
commission
gives
you
three
options
to
file
mileage
rates,
attaching
that
to
the
tariff,
specify
what
the
mileage
is,
or
refer
to
a
guide.
mr.
william
j.
augello
i...
i
don't...
no,
i
don't
say
that.
i'm
saying
he
has
that
option
of
specifying
what
the
mileage
is.
mr.
william
j.
augello
how
close?
mr.
william
j.
augello
i
wouldn't
expect
anyone
would
do
that,
but,
you
know,
from
a
hypothetical
standpoint
i
suppose
if
a
competitor
found
him
doing
that
he'd
have
a
right
to
file
a
complaint,
and--
mr.
william
j.
augello
--as
long
as
there's
no
discrimination.
mr.
william
j.
augello
that's
a
novel
one,
but...
i
suppose
they
could
also
say,
you
get
a
reduced
rate
if
your
freight
travels
over
saturday
night,
like
the
airlines.
but
there
are
two
components
to
a
mileage
rate,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
william
j.
augello
and
both
components
must
be
published
in
a
tariff.
when
they
are
not,
it
voids
the
rate
tariff
that
refers
to
that
tariff.
you'll
see
a
copy
of
all
of
the
tariff
pages
in
our
briefs
and
in
our
joint
appendix,
showing
you
just
how
that
works.
there
must
be
a
sequence,
and
under
this
court's
teachings,
the
filed
rate
doctrine
must
be
strictly
enforced.
the
point
is,
it
must
be
strictly
enforced
against
carriers
as
well
as
shippers,
and
in
this
case...
and
incidentally,
this
is
the
first
case
where
the
strict
application
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine
works
against
the
carrier's
interest,
but
it's
the
carrier
who
violated
the
law,
and
so
we
believe
that
the
court
below
properly
granted
summary
judgment
and
dismissed
the
actions
because
without
an
effective
tariff
there
is
no
basis
for
an
undercharge.
there's
got
to
be
the
foundation
of
an
effective,
lawful
tariff
before
you
can
file
an
undercharge
claim.
mr.
william
j.
augello
yes,
it
does,
because
they're
trying
to
collect
the
undercharges.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
carrier's
bankrupt
or
not.
but
in
closing
i
just
would
like
to--
mr.
william
j.
augello
--yes,
even
though
that
filed
rate
was
not
honored
by
him
originally.
he
negotiated
his
rates
with
the
shippers,
he
told
them
that
the
rates
are
on
file,
but
then
didn't
adhere
to
the
rates,
but
met
the
market-driven
competitive
rates.
that's
what's
happened
in
this
whole
field,
and
then
later
on
when
his
auditors
come
in
and
get
hired
by
the
bankruptcy
trustee,
they
look
for
these
defects.
mr.
william
j.
augello
but
i...
thank
you,
your
honor.
