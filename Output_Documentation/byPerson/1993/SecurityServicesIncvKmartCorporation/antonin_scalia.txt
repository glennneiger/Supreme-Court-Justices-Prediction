justice
antonin
scalia
but
both
the
mileage
guide
itself
and
the
commission
regulations,
as
i
understand
it,
advised
whoever
was
going
to
check
the
tariff
not
to
look
to
that
mileage
guide
after
a
certain
date,
namely,
the
date
when
you
were
no
longer
listed
as
one
of
the
people
supporting
that
mileage
guide.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
not
confuse
the
public
at
least?
the
public
wouldn't
know
whether
you
continued
to
be
using
that
mileage
guide
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
have
to
call
it
a
voiding
power.
you
just
have
to
call
it
putting
the
public
on
notice.
the
public
reading
the
regs
and
reading
the
guide
itself,
or
the
things
attached
to
the
guide,
would
believe
that
you
were
no
longer
using
that
mileage
guide
after
a
certain
date.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
what
if
somebody
else
who
read
the
icc's
rules
said,
i'm
going
to
use
this
mileage
guide
to
start
off
with,
but
after
a
certain
date
i'm
going
to
withdraw
from
it,
after
which
that
will
not
govern
me.
now,
couldn't
a
person
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
now,
how
is
the
public
to
know
whether
you're
that
kind
of
person
or
whether
you
are
your
kind
of
person--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
wants
to
continue
to
have
the
mileage
guide
applicable?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is
the
mileage,
but
the
reader
might
think
well,
of
course,
they
are
doing
that
on
the
assumption
that
they
are
following
the
icc's
rules,
which
means
they
only
mean
it
for
so
long
as
they
continue
to
subscribe
to
the
mileage
guide.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taylor,
i
assumed...
well,
under
one
of
the
regs
of
the
commerce
commission
you
can
file
a
rate
that
has
an
expiration
date
on
it,
can't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
happens
to
that
rate
when
the
expiration
date
comes?
it
automatically
is
no
longer
effective?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
isn't
this
simply
the
same
thing?
what
the
commission's
rule
said
is
that
if
you
file
a
rate
that
refers
to
this
extrinsic
mileage
chart,
your
rate
will
automatically
expire
at
the
time
that...
it's
simply
telling
the
public
that...
it's
just
like
saying,
in
the
regs,
when
you
say,
we
will
round
off
your
mileage
to
the
nearest
hundred
so
that
if
you
say,
75
miles,
that
shall
be
deemed
to
be
100
miles.
anybody
that
files
a
rate
that
says,
75
miles,
will
know
that
it
means
100
miles.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
icc
had
in
effect
said
riss'
tariff
shall
be
deemed
to
expire
when
riss'
membership
expires.
that's
what
the
icc...
now,
do
you
say
that
the
rule
was
unauthorized?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
that
is
not
how
it
works
out.
do
you
have
a
case
for
that
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
augello,
mr.
taylor
has
told
us
that
by
1985,
when
this
tariff
as
you
put
it
no
longer
governed
because
the
company
no
longer
participated
in
it,
by
that
time,
the
commission
by
decision
had
eliminated
the
requirement
that
you
be
a
participant.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
incorrect?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
the
same
reason
mr.
taylor's
client
didn't
charge
the
tariffed
rate.
they
thought
the
old
rules
were
all
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
cares
about
tariffs?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
icc's
not
enforcing
them
any
more.
a
reasonable
rate
is
what
the
market
will
bear,
and...
part
of
the
same
development,
i
assume,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
doesn't
matter
how
unrealistic
the
mileage
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
he
wants
to
have
an
advantage
from
not
having
turned
one
square
corner,
but
not
the
disadvantage
of
not
having
turned
the
other.
or
to
put
it
another
way,
he
can
have
his
pound
of
flesh
but
not
one
drop
of
blood.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
reason
for
that
nonparticipation
rule,
mr.
manning?
is
it
really
just
to
enable
the
person
who
files
the
other
tariff
to
be
able
to
collect
$83,
or
is
there
some
other
reason
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
really
a
new
belief
in
the
centrality
of
filed
rates
by
the
commission
after
our
last
few
decisions.
it's
fair
to
say
that
during
the
period
at
issue
here,
the
commission
didn't
believe
in
the
centrality
of
filed
rates.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
now,
at
least,
post
maislin,
the
commission
is
proceeding
logically
and
consistently.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait...
wait.
it
just
said
that
that
many
referred
to.
did
it
say
that
many
carriers
who
were
not
participating?
