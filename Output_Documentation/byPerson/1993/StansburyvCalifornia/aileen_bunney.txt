ms.
aileen
bunney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here
is
custody.
as
enunciated
in
berkemer
v.
mccarty,
custody
is
determined
from
the
perspective
of
the
reasonable
person.
ms.
aileen
bunney
we
agree
that
you
must
use
an
objective
standard.
ms.
aileen
bunney
we
also
ask
the
court
to
uphold
the
california
court's
finding
that
petitioner
was
not
in
custody.
we
believe
that
an
analysis
of
whether
an
individual
is
in
custody
should
begin
with
the
initial
encounter
between
the
police
and
the
citizen.
here,
we
have
state
court
findings,
factual
findings
that
petitioner
consented
to
the
officer's
request
to
accompany
him
to
the
police
station.
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
stansbury
"was
invited,
not
commanded"
to
come
to
the
police--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--excuse
me,
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
we--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--your
honor,
the
part
that
makes
the
difference
is
undisclosed.
in
this
case,
it
was
not
undisclosed.
ms.
aileen
bunney
no--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--no,
your
honor--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--we
also
disagree
with
the
question
presented.
as
i
will
go
into
the
specifics
of
this
case,
the
subjective
intent
was
disclosed
to
the
defendant.
we
agree
you
use
a
reasonable
standard,
the
reasonable
person
standard,
an
objective
standard.
to
that
we
do
agree,
your
honor.
the
california
supreme
court's
factual
finding--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--there
are
some
statements
in
the
california
supreme
court's
opinion
which
do
relate
to
subjective
intent.
ms.
aileen
bunney
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
aileen
bunney
your
honor--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
standard
employed
by
the
california
supreme
court
was
essentially
correct.
the
first
part
of
the
inquiry
relates
to
how
stansbury
got
to
the
police
station.
the
california
supreme
court
made
a
factual
finding
that
he
was
invited,
not
commanded,
to
come
to
the
police
station
for
an
interview.
petitioner
relies
on
this
court's
opinion
on
dunaway
v.
new
york,
but
in
dunaway,
the
state
court
found
"this
case
does
not
involve
a
situation
where
the
defendant
voluntarily
appeared
at
police
headquarters
in
response
to
a
request
of
the
police.
"
this
court
declined
to
reconsider
these
state
court
findings.
here
you
have
the
exact
opposite
state
court
finding,
and
as
this
court
held
in
schneckloth
v.
bustamonte,
the
issue
of
consent
is
a
factual
question.
thus,
petitioner's
attempt
to
resurrect
his
argument
that
a
show
of
force
compelled
his
acquiescence
must
be
rejected.
petitioner
can
prevail
only
if
there
is
no
consent
as
a
matter
of
law.
on
this
record
petitioner
cannot
show
the
absence
of
consent.
similarly,
the
state
courts
found
that
petition
consented
to
transportation
by
the
police,
and
if
i
may,
your
honor,
just
briefly
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
earlier
question
about
the
guns,
because
he
consented,
the
guns
are
not
relevant,
but
i
will
state
that
the
state
supreme
court
found
there
was
no
evidence
he
saw
the
guns,
and
officer
lee,
the
only
officer
who
spoke
with
petitioner,
specifically
testified
that
he
took
the
gun
out
but
hid
it
behind
his
leg.
that's
how
the
gun
could
be
out,
but
not
seen.
he
hid
it
behind
his
leg.
ms.
aileen
bunney
first,
your
honor,
with
response
to
the
guns,
again,
it's
our
position
that
the
court
found
that
defendant
didn't
see
the
guns.
the
guns
are
only
relevant
if
he
sees
them.
second
of
all,
the
issue
with
respect
of
how
he
gets
to
the
police
station
is
really
one
of
consent.
he
either
consents
to
go
or
he
doesn't
consent,
and
once
and
consents,
and
once
he's
there,
then
the
factual
inferences
as
to
the
earlier
are
drawn
in
favor
of
consent.
ms.
aileen
bunney
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--the
court
can
look
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
but
where--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--the
importance
of
it
is
that
the
facts
are
resolved
in
favor
of
consent,
so
that
that
fact
becomes,
at
most,
less
significant.
ms.
aileen
bunney
what
i'm
basing
it
on,
your
honor,
is
a
page
476
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
which
the
court
said
there
is
no
evidence
defendant
saw
the
guns.
ms.
aileen
bunney
well,
we
believe
it
is
equivalent
to
finding
that.
ms.
aileen
bunney
the
basis
is
the
california
supreme
court's
finding
that
he
was
invited,
that
he
was
invited,
not
commanded
to
come
to
the
police
department.
ms.
aileen
bunney
yes,
that
it
was
voluntary,
and
similarly,
the
state
courts
found
that
petition
consented
to
transportation
by
the
police.
as
held
by
the
california
supreme
court,
the
police
"solicited
his
voluntary
cooperation,
asked
if
he
wanted
to
drive
himself
to
the
station,
and
conducted
him
there
under
no
restraint.
"
ms.
aileen
bunney
it's
not
necessarily
that
they're
polite,
although...
it's...
in
this
case,
what
the
police
said
is,
you're
a
possible
witness
to
a
homicide,
and
we
have
homicide
investigators
who'd
like
to
talk
to
you,
will
you
come
along
with
us?
that's
what
makes
it
consensual,
is
what
was
conveyed
to
him,
as
well
as
his
response.
ms.
aileen
bunney
well,
this
officer
was
in
plain
clothes,
and
the
gun...
at
least
the
officer
that
he
spoke
to,
the
gun
was
not
visible.
ms.
aileen
bunney
and
officer
lee
testified
that
he
deliberately
hid
the
gun.
ms.
aileen
bunney
there
were
four
officers,
your
honor,
but
the
one
officer
who
talked
to
him
was
the
one
officer
who
testified
on
that
point.
ms.
aileen
bunney
no,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case
officer
lee
specifically
testified,
as
a
narcotics
officer,
i
hide
my
gun
behind
my
leg.
ms.
aileen
bunney
it
was
in
his
hand,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
not
displayed.
ms.
aileen
bunney
this
was
11:00
at
night,
your
honor.
as
far
as
the
transportation,
returning
to
the
transportation,
petitioner
sat
in
the
front
seat
of
an
unmarked
car,
and
he
was
not
handcuffed.
ms.
aileen
bunney
there
was
one
officer
in
the
back
seat.
he
went
only
four
or
five
blocks
to
the
police
station.
as
the
state
courts
found,
he
voluntarily
accompanied
them
to
the
police
station.
when
they
arrived
at
the
police
station,
they
escorted
stansbury
through
the
only
entrance
to
the
police
station
from
the
police
parking
lot,
which
took
them
into
the
jail
portion
of
the
station.
once
inside,
officer
lee
asked
a
local
officer
where
to
take
stansbury
for
an
interview,
and
took
stansbury
where
the
officer
directed
them.
the
interview
room
was
a
room
with
a
table
and
three
or
four
chairs.
nothing
in
the
police
officer's
conduct
or
the
room
itself
converted
the
consensual
encounter
into
the
functional
equivalent
of
arrest.
the
issue
then
becomes
whether
the
interview
itself
custodial
interrogation.
ms.
aileen
bunney
the
record
does
not
reflect
that,
your
honor.
ms.
aileen
bunney
either
way.
the
standard
employed
by
the
california
supreme
court
is
substantially
correct.
the
california
courts
look
to
four
standards:
first,
the
site
of
the
interrogation,
second,
whether
the
investigation
had
focused
on
the
subject,
three,
whether
the
objective
indicia
of
arrest
were
present,
and
four,
the
length
and
form
of
questioning.
we
address
each
of
these
considerations.
first,
the
site
of
the
interrogation.
while
the
interrogation
here
took
place
at
the
police
station,
petitioner
went
there
voluntarily.
as
this
court
held
in
california
v.
beheler
and
oregon
v.
mathiason,
questioning
at
the
station
house
is
not
determinative
of
custody.
miranda
doesn't
draw
a
line
at
the
station
house
door.
while
petitioner
argues
that--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--in
this
case--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--and
that's...
petitioner
argues
that
he
was
in
custody
because
he
needed
assistance
to
leave
the
police
station,
but
police
stations
are
routinely
locked
facilities,
secured
facilities.
citizens
normally
need
assistance
or
directions
to
leave--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--the
only
difference
is
that
the
police
station
is
part
of
the
jail
facility,
so
there's...
in
this
case
it
doesn't,
because
citizens
do
need
assistance
to
get
out
of
the
police
station,
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
public
lobby.
ms.
aileen
bunney
that's
right--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--that
doesn't
mean
that
the
person...
that...
each
entrance
to
this
police
station
required
entrance
through
a
secured
doorway,
with
the
exception
of
the
public
lobby.
now,
whether
the
doorway
is
locked
both
ways
or
not,
that's
not
part
of
the
record.
certainly,
in
the
jail
you
would
need
assistance
to
get
out.
in
order
to
get
into
the
other
part
of
the
police
station,
it
was
also
a
secured
facility.
whether...
what's
not
clear
from
the
record
is
whether
you
could
get
out.
basically,
if
you
accept
petitioner's
argument,
oregon
v.
mathiason
and
california
v.
beheler
are
no
longer
viable,
because
under
petitioner's
view,
every
station
house
interrogation
would
be
custodial.
now,
the
second
factor
is
whether
the
investigation
focused
on
the
subject.
petitioner's
argument
is
that
that
factor
is
irrelevant,
but
petitioner
paints
with
too
broad
a
brush.
while
the
focus
of
an
investigation
may
be--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--and
that--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--to
the
extent
it
wasn't
disclosed
to
the
defendant.
ms.
aileen
bunney
but--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honor,
in
this
case,
what
was
communicated
to
the
defendant
on
two
different
occasions
was
that
he
was
a
witness.
that's
what
makes
relevant
the
police
officer's
knowledge
as
to
what
was
going
on...
his
investigative
leads.
because
if...
a
reasonable
person
under
the
circumstances,
if
you
tell
him
that
he's
a
witness
and
he
may
have
information
helpful
to
the
police
in
a
murder
investigation,
he's
going
to
be
aware
that
the
police
officers
have
leads.
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
it
becomes
relevant
under
these
circumstances.
ms.
aileen
bunney
in...
where
the
information
is
somehow
conveyed
to
the
defendant,
either
by
word
or
action,
then
the
focus
is
relevant.
ms.
aileen
bunney
that's...
that's
our
point,
your
honor,
that--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--at
the
beginning
of
the
interview--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--at
the
beginning
of
the
interview,
johnson
told
stansbury
that
he
was
a
witness
only.
during
the
course--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--both
officer
lee
at
the
house
and
lieutenant
johnson
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--told
stansbury
that
he
was
a
witness.
officer
lee
happened
to
phrase
it
that
you
were
a
possible
witness
to
a
homicide.
lieutenant
johnston
says,
told
him
that
you
were
a
possible
witness
to
the
abduction
of
a
young
child.
both
officers
told
him
at
two
different
points
in
time.
what
else
during
the
course
of
the
interview
is
the
nature
of
the
questioning,
which
is
another
factor
that
we
should
address,
which
is,
where
he's
not
the
focus
of
the
investigation,
the
nature
of
the
questioning
is
not
accusatory.
that's
another
way
that
the
police
convey
to
a
defendant,
or
a
citizen,
whether
or
not
he's
the
focus
of
suspicion.
so
the
second
factor,
which
i've
already
addressed,
and
the
fourth,
which
i
will,
do
tie
together,
because
those
are
communicated
to
the
defendant.
ms.
aileen
bunney
well...
yes,
your
honor,
because
obviously
you're
a
witness...
if
you
commit
the
crime,
you
witness
what
happened,
so
i
don't
think
that
you
couldn't
be
both.
in
this
case,
there's
nothing
which
indicates
that
he
was
treated
anything
other
than
as
a
witness.
ms.
aileen
bunney
that's--
ms.
aileen
bunney
--that
happens,
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true,
but
normally
what
happens
in
those
circumstances,
you're
still
talking
about
accusatory
types
of
questioning.
in
florida
v.
bostick,
this
court
held
that
the
reasonable
person
standard
necessarily
presupposes
an
innocent
person.
the
nonthreatening
nature
of
a
police
request
here
suggests
that
the
reasonable,
innocent
person
would
be
willing
to
answer
questions
pertaining
to
a
serious
crime
to
which
he
may
have
information.
the
third
factor
is
the
objective
indicia
of
arrest,
and
that's
also,
again,
an
objective
factor
relied
on
by
the
california
supreme
court.
petitioner
was
never
told
he
was
under
arrest.
he
was
never
handcuffed,
he
was
never
booked
prior
to
questioning,
and
he
was
never
told
that
he
wasn't
free
to
leave.
the
last
factor
is
the
length
and
form
of
questioning,
which
again
ties
back
to
the
second
factor.
the
interview
here
lasted
only
20
to
30
minutes.
its
brevity
argues
in
favor
of
the
absence
of
custody.
as
to
the
form
of
the
questioning,
only
one
officer
interviewed
stansbury.
the
interview
was
largely
narrative
on
petitioner's
part.
stansbury
was
never
confronted
with
evidence
of
his
guilt.
the
interview
was
in
no
way
accusatory.
miranda
itself
acknowledges
the
role
of
accusatory
questioning
on
custody:
"the
aura
of
confidence
in
his
guilt
undermines
his
will
to
resist.
"
"he
merely
confirms
the
preconceived
story
the
police
seek
to
have
him
describe.
"
this
environment
was
singularly
lacking
here
because
the
police
told
stansbury
he
was
a
witness,
and
questioned
him
in
a
manner
consistent
with
that
characterization.
stansbury
never
hesitated
in
his
responses,
never
asked
to
leave,
never
expressed
any
desire
to
stop
the
interview,
even
temporarily.
in
berkemer
v.
mccarty,
this
court
held
that
the
defendant
"failed
to
demonstrate
that
at
any
time
between
the
initial
stop
and
the
arrest,
he
was
subjected
to
restraints
comparable
to
those
associated
with
a
formal
arrest.
"
here,
also,
petitioner
has
failed
to
demonstrate
that
he
was
subjected
to
restraint
equivalent
to
formal
arrest.
in
conclusion,
petitioner
was
never
in
custody.
he
voluntarily
agreed
to
go
to
the
station,
he
voluntarily
agreed
to
the
police
transportation,
he
was
escorted
to
an
interview
room
with
a
table
and
chairs,
he
was
told
that
he
was
a
potential
witness
to
the
abduction
of
a
young
child.
the
questioning
was
neutral,
nonaccusatory,
the
answers
largely
narrative.
petitioner
answered
readily
and
without
hesitation.
petitioner
never
indicated
that
he
wanted
to
withdraw
his
consent.
the
record
in
this
case
fully
supports
the
state
court's
findings,
and
we
ask
the
court
to
so
find.
thank
you.
