unknown
speaker
mr.
stansbury,
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
is
whether
a
trial
court
can
determine
that
a
criminal
defendant
is
not
in
custody
for
miranda
purposes
on
the
basis
of
the
police
officer's
subjective
intent
that
they
didn't
consider
the
defendant
a
suspect.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
ordinarily
go
into
extensive
review
of
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
speaking
for
myself,
i
think
you're
probably
right
about
the
standard
that
we
have
enunciated,
but
again
speaking
for
myself,
i
didn't
think
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
departed
in
any
material
way
from
it.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
acknowledging,
then,
that
the
answer
to
the
question
presented
is
no?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
correct
answer
to
the
question
presented,
and
the
only
question
is
what
we
do
from
there
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
the
appropriate
thing
if
the
wrong
standard
was
used,
for
us
to
say
that's...
the
rest
of
it
should
be
redone
by
the
california
court
and
not
by
us?
unknown
speaker
but
why
should
this
court
make
the
determination--
unknown
speaker
--that
ordinarily
would
be
made
by
the
california
court?
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
custody,
then
what
follows
from
that?
what
would
be
the
bottom
line?
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
say
that
for
miranda
purposes
it
is
irrelevant
whether
the
investigation
has
focused
on
the
suspect,
or
are
you
just
contending
that
in
making
that
determination
we
must
use
objective
evidence
only?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
a
correct
and
relevant
inquiry
to
ask
whether
or
not
the
investigation
has
focused
on
the
subject--
unknown
speaker
--provided
you
use
only
objective
indicia
to
make
that
determination?
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
or
not
the
investigation
was
focusing
on
him
would
have
some
bearing
on
his
conclusion,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
if
our
standard
is
supposed
to
be
how
would
a
reasonable
person
perceive...
would
a
reasonable
person
feel
himself
in
custody,
then
we
don't
take
into
account
at
all
that
this
is
a
person
who
is
in
fact...
who
in
fact
committed
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
so
we
keep
the--
unknown
speaker
--right.
it
would
be
just
as
though
the
police
had
picked
up
the
roommate
of
the
defendant...
of
the
petitioner
for
questioning.
would
we
perceive
that
person
being
taken
to
the
police
station,
being
put
in
a
locked
place,
as
being
in
custody?
unknown
speaker
there
was
one
part
of
that
scenario
that
was
confusing
to
me.
perhaps
you
can
clarify
it.
it
was
said
that
the
police
had
their
guns
drawn
but
they
weren't
visible.
how
can
you
have
drawn
guns
that
aren't
visible?
unknown
speaker
mr.
westberg,
i'm
looking
through
the
pages
of
the
appendix
that
contain
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
and
on
page
471,
the
first
sentence
in
the
first
full
paragraph
is...
it's
this
volume
ii
of
the
joint
appendix.
unknown
speaker
it
says,
custody
"occurs
if
the
suspect
is
physically
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
action
in
any
way
or
is
led
to
believe,
as
a
reasonable
person,
that
he
is
so
deprived.
"
unknown
speaker
and
then
again
on
page
476,
they
announce
the
same
thing.
it's
the
perception
of
a
reasonable
person.
ordinarily
we
defer
to
state
courts'
findings
of
fact
if
they've
adopted
the
proper
test,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
considerable
evidence
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
adopting
exactly
the
test
that
you
say
should
govern.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
presumably
the
trial
court
may
have
made
implied
findings
when
it
declined
to
suppress
what
it
did
suppress
of
the
statements.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
contend
there's
anything
impossible
about
a
person
not
being
in
custody
at
the
outset
of
the
interrogation
and
being
in
custody
later
on.
you
acknowledged
earlier
that
at
least
where
the
investigator's
suspicions
are
conveyed...
are
conveyed
to
the
individual,
that
is
a
very
relevant
factor
of
whether
custody
exists
or
not.
so
it
could
be
that
in
the
course
of
the
interview
their
questioning
becomes
more
and
more
accusatory,
more
and
more
adversary--
unknown
speaker
--at
this
point
custody
attaches.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
was
the
room
locked?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
assume--
unknown
speaker
--if
the
door
is
locked
there's
a--
unknown
speaker
--greater
probability
he's
in
custody
than
if
it
isn't
locked.
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
whether
the
door
was
locked
was
raised
in
a
question
and
not...
and
the
evidence
is
unclear
on
what
the
answer
is.
unknown
speaker
what
is
clear
is
that
the
exit--
unknown
speaker
--from
the
jail
was
locked.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that's
the
case
for
the
police
who
are
there,
too,
or
if
i
went
to
visit,
i
couldn't
get
out
with
out
a
key.
it
doesn't
mean
i'm
in
custody,
necessarily,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
it
just
means
that
they
chose
to
interrogate
him
there,
and
nobody
who's
in
there,
even
if
he's
a
policeman,
even
if
he's
the
warden,
can
get
out
without
somebody
opening
the
door.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
stansbury--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
bunney.
unknown
speaker
so
you
really
concede
the
legal
issue
in
the
case,
that
we
must
use
the
objective
standard?
unknown
speaker
so
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
or
not
under
the
objective
standard
the
california
supreme
court
was
correct
in
reaching
its
finding.
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
do
with
the
part
of
the
california
decision
that
says
the
trial
court's
determination
that
suspicion
focused
on
defendant
only
when
he
mentioned
the
turquoise
car
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence?
that
was...
do
we...
i
think
you're
asking
us
essentially
to
delete
what...
moreover,
this
decision,
that
is,
the
trial
court
concluded
that
when
the
defendant
was
brought
to
the
station
he
was
not
the
focus
of
suspicion,
and
he
question
presented
was
whether
that
was...
whether
what
was
in
the
police
officer's
mind
was
a
determinant
of
whether
defendant
was
in
custody.
but
you're
answering...
both
sides
agree
that
the
answer
to
the
question
presented
is
no.
unknown
speaker
the
question
presented
is,
may
a
trial
court
determine
that
a
criminal
defendant
is
not
in
custody
on
the
basis
of
police
officers'
subjective,
undisclosed
conclusion
that
they
did
not
consider
defendant
a
suspect.
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
is
undisclosed.
the
question
presented
is,
if
the
criminal...
may
a
trial
court
determine
that
a
defendant
is
in
custody
on
the
basis
of
a...
the
subjective
view
of
the
police
officer,
undisclosed.
you're
answering
a
different
question.
how
do
you
answer
the
question,
subjective
and
undisclosed
conclusion
that
they
do
not
consider
the
defendant
a
suspect?
unknown
speaker
you're
answer
to
the
question
presented
is
no--
unknown
speaker
--and
so
both
sides
agree
that
the
question
presented
should
be
answered
no,
and
then
what
do
we
do,
having
answered
the
question
presented,
no.
unknown
speaker
would...
yes,
we
need
to
get
into
that.
would
you
agree
that
there
are
numerous
statements
in
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
that
are
relevant
only
to
show
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officers?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
found
11.
unknown
speaker
and
the
trial
court
likewise
seemed
to
find
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officers
quite
important.
is
there
a...
i
suppose
we
could
send
this
back
to
the
state
courts--
unknown
speaker
--to
directly
focus
their
attention.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
it's
irrelevant
that
the
guns
were
drawn
simply
because
a
finding
may
have
been
made
that
at
that
point
he
was
going
voluntarily.
i
mean,
one
of
the
issues
before
us
is
whether...
or
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
at
some
time
in
the
course
of
this
interrogation
the
totality
of
facts
added
up
in
such
a
way
that
the
reasonable
suspect
would
have
said
to
himself,
i
haven't
got
any
choice
but
to
be
here.
and
even
assuming
that
he
was
going
voluntarily
when
he
left
the
house,
or
the
trailer,
if
in
fact
he
was
aware
of
drawn
guns,
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
he's
going
to
bear
in
mind,
or
may
bear
in
mind
30
minutes
later,
when
he
says
to
himself,
am
i
really
free
to
leave
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
were
making
the
point
that
all
of
these
earlier
facts
which
he
was
pointing
to
in
effect
once
they
re
resolved
at
an
earlier
stage
against
him
are
thereafter
rendered
totally
irrelevant
for
whatever...
even
if
they
arguably
have
a
bearing
on
his
feelings
at
a
later
stage.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
he
doesn't
acquire
amnesia
at
the
point
at
which
he
gets
into
the
car,
or
the
point
at
which
he
enters
the
police
station,
and
isn't
he
entitled
to
consider
the
cumulative
effect
of
all
the
facts?
he
may,
for
example,
have
gone
voluntarily,
despite
guns
which
he
saw,
if
he
saw
them,
or
despite
being
driven
by
the
police,
but
at
some
point
15
or
20
minutes
later,
he
may
say,
wait
a
minute,
i
may
have
thought
that
i
was
doing
this
voluntarily,
but
i
understand
what's
going
on
now.
they
had
guns,
they
took
me,
they
brought
me
into
jail,
they
locked
the
door,
i'm
in
this
room,
and
so
on,
and
i
am
no
longer
free
to
go.
isn't
that
a
fair
process
of
inference
for
a
person
in
his
position
to
engage
in?
unknown
speaker
that
really
was
my
only
point.
the
circumstance
is
not
rendered
irrelevant
for
its
bearing
at
a
later
stage,
simply
because
at
an
earlier
stage
a
court
says,
i've
considered
that
circumstance,
and
i
do
not
find
that
at
this
earlier
stage
he's
in
custody.
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
what...
your
point
about
the
guns
were
that
the
california
court
found
that
the
guns
were
not
seen?
is
that
from
page
472
that
you're
basing
that?
one
was
not
seen
because
it
was
behind
the
leg.
the
other
one,
it
doesn't
really
say
whether
it
was
seen
or
not
seen.
it
just
says
that
it
was
drawn
but
not
pointed.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
not
quite
the
equivalent
of
finding
that
he
did
not
see
them.
unknown
speaker
and
the
finding
on
consent
is
the
statement,
defendant
was
very
cooperative
and
agreed
to
come
in
to
the
pomona
police
department
for
an
interview?
unknown
speaker
and
the
fact
that
he
accepted
the
invitation
means
it
was
truly
voluntarily.
unknown
speaker
what
makes
it
an
invitation?
if
the
police
are
polite,
and
they
say,
would
you
please
accompany
us
to
the
station,
is
that
an
invitation?
unknown
speaker
if
someone
says,
will
you
come
along
with
us,
and
points
a
gun,
or
has
a
gun
visible,
that
would
convey
a
different
impression
to
a
reasonable
mind,
would
it
not,
than
if
somebody
is
in
plain
clothes
and
says--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that...
again,
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
visible.
we
know
it
was
drawn.
unknown
speaker
one...
and
how
many
officers--
unknown
speaker
--it's
just
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
a
gun
is
in
a
person's
hand...
the
other
officer
said,
the
gun
was
not
drawn
but
in
his
hand,
not
pointed,
but
if
a
gun
is
in
your
hand,
it
seems
to
me
it's
got
to
be
visible.
is
that
wrong?
unknown
speaker
but
the
other
officer
testified...
i'm
reading
at
the
top
of
page
476.
the
other
officer
who
testified
said,
his
gun
was
not
drawn,
but
in
his
hand,
so
it
was
in
his
hand.
unknown
speaker
what
time
of
day
did
this
take
place?
unknown
speaker
were
there
officers
in
the
back
seat?
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
a
moment
to
the
offer
to
let
him
drive
himself?
does
the
record
indicate
whether
an
officer
would
have
accompanied
him
in
his
car
had
he
elected
to
drive
himself?
unknown
speaker
either
way?
unknown
speaker
you
do
agree
that
it's
a
little
more
difficult
that
it
wasn't
in
just
the
station
house
that
you
can
enter
and
exit,
but
that
it
was
that
he
was
in
the
jail
portion
where
you
have
to
get
through
several
barriers,
and
you
couldn't
do
it
on
your
own.
unknown
speaker
that's
something
of
a
weighing
factor
that
would
be
in
a
reasonable
mind.
one
of
the
things
that
would
be
in
a
reasonable
mind
is
gee,
i
can't
get
out.
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference
that
it
was
in
the
jail
part
as
distinguished
from
the
part
where
the
public
comes
in
and
out
of
the
police
station?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
something
about,
one
of
these
police
officers
was
from
a
different
district
and
didn't
know...
he
only
knew
how
to
come
in
through
the
jail
way?
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
way
to
get
into
that
police
station
that
you
could
get
out
of,
too,
without
a
key,
but
that
was
not
the
part
that
he
was
in.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
said
that
it
is
relevant
provided
it
is
objectively
communicated
to
the
defendant--
unknown
speaker
--or
the
suspect,
and
there
are
at
least
11
different
parts
of
the
california
supreme
court
opinion,
beginning
at
page
471,
where
the
supreme
court
talks
about
what
johnson
was
thinking
about,
and
you
concede
that
is
irrelevant,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
of
course...
to
the
extent
it
was
not
disclosed.
unknown
speaker
so
i
think
the
chief
justice
is
quite
correct
that
the
california
supreme
court
enunciated
the
correct
legal
standard.
the
problem
i
have
is
that
at
11
different
points
it
engages
in
a
discussion
of
matters
that
are
quite
irrelevant
to
that
standard,
and
i'm
not
quite--
--well,
i
hope
you
don't
concede
it's
irrelevant.
do
you
concede
it's
irrelevant?
it
can't
be
conveyed
if
it
doesn't
exist,
can
it?
how
can
you
convey
that
he
is
the
focus
of
the
investigation,
if
in
fact
he
is
not
the
focus
of
the
investigation?
it
is
not
a
sufficient
condition,
but
it
is
a
necessary
condition,
isn't
it,
and
that
makes
it
relevant,
it
seems
to
me.
why
don't
you
first
answer
justice
kennedy's
question,
and
then
justice
scalia?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it
what?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
find
it
not
at
all
surprising
that
the
california
supreme
court
talks
about
whether
subjectively
these
investigating
officers
thought
that
this
person
was
a
target
of
the
investigation.
if
they
subjectively
did
not
even
think
it,
then
how
could
they
have
conveyed
a
fact
that
did
not
exist?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
perfectly
proper
for
the
california
court
to
talk
about
the
subjective
intentions.
what
is
it
in
the
record
that
shows
that
johnson's
subjective
intentions
and
his
focus
of
the
investigation
were
communicated
to
the
defendant
after
the
interview
had
begun?
unknown
speaker
after
the...
yes,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
was
this
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview,
or
when
he
was
at
the
house?
unknown
speaker
johnson
at
the
station.
unknown
speaker
can
you
be
a
witness
and
a
suspect
at
the
same
time?
unknown
speaker
going
to
the
question
whether
the
officers
would
have
in
fact
have
had
to
have
thought
he
was
a
suspect
in
order
to
communicate
that
idea
to
them,
is
it
not
true
that
there
are
many
police
interrogations
in
which
the
police
in
the
course
