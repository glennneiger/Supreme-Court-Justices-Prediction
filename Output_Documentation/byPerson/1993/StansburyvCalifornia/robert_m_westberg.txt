mr.
robert
m.
westberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
the
rape
and
murder
of
a
10-year-old
girl
and
has
been
sentenced
to
death.
the
question
in
this
court...
the
question
in
this
court
is
whether
miranda
applies
to
statements
that
he
made
during
questioning
in
jail,
without
miranda
warnings,
and
before
he
had
been
formally
arrested.
the
statements
were
not
by
any
means
a
confession
of
guilt,
but
were
incriminating.
the
single
issue
here
is
whether
the
petitioner
was
in
custody
at
the
time
of
the
statements.
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
trial
court
and
it
has
been
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
petitioner
did
not
testify
at
that
evidentiary
hearing,
only
the
police
did.
the
state
at
that
time
had
the
burden
of
proving
at
the
hearing
that
the
petitioner
was
not
in
custody
in
order
to
show
the
admissibility
of
the
statements.
the
trial
court
excluded,
under
miranda,
part
of
the
statements,
but
only
the
part
that
was
said
after
suspicion
had
focused
in
the
policeman's
mind
on
the
petitioner.
the
trial
court
found
that
this
happened
at
the
time
that
the
petitioner
described
an
automobile
he
had
borrowed
on
the
night
of
the
murder
as
a
turquoise
car.
the
trial
court
made
no
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
at
all,
other
than
as
to
the
particular
point
in
the
questioning
that
the
suspicion
switched
to
the
petitioner,
and
the
california
supreme
court
affirmed.
that
court
said
that
the
trial
court's
finding
as
to
the
point
when
suspicion
focused
on
the
petitioner
was
supported
by
the
evidence,
and
the
court
pointed
out
testimony
of
the
police
officers
that
until
that
point
they
would
have
let
the
petitioner
go,
had
he
requested.
i
will
try
to
cover
three
points
this
morning:
first,
very
briefly,
the
facts
that
we
think
are
material
to
the
custody
issue;
second,
to
discuss
this
court's
decisions,
especially
the
reasoning
of
the
decisions,
that
show
that
the
state
courts
used
the
wrong
analysis
of
the
issue
and
also
the
factual
elements
that
we
think
support
a
conclusion
that
petitioner
was
in
custody,
and
third
to
demonstrate
that
the
respondent's
approach
is
unworkable
and
has
largely
been
rejected
by
this
court.
the
material
facts
are
quite
simple.
the
victim
in
the
case,
a
robyn
jackson,
disappeared
from
a
neighborhood
playground.
her
body
was
found
a
very
few
hours
later.
a
witness
saw
a
car
from
which
the
body
was
thrown.
he
described
it
as
turquoise.
the
police
were
told
that
robyn
had
planned
to
meet
an
ice-cream
truck
driver
with
whom
she
had
been
friendly.
the
police
found
two
ice-cream
drivers
who
had
been
in
the
neighborhood
on
the
day
of
the
murder...
now,
we're
on
the
day
after
the
murder...
and
they
determined
to
interview
or
question
these
men.
the
petitioner
was
one
of
them.
eight
police
officers,
or
sheriff's
deputies,
went
to
the
home
of
the
first
driver,
not
petitioner,
and
they
were
told
that
he
was
not
at
home,
but
they
went
in
anyway
and
searched
from
room
to
room
and
found
him
hiding
under
a
bed.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
the
extensive...
i'm
not
going
into
an
extensive
review
of
the
facts,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
issue
as
to
what
caused
the
suspicion
to
focus
on
the
defendant
was,
of
course,
the
principal
issue
in
the
court
below.
the
question
for
this
court
is
whether
that
is
the
correct
standard
on
which
to
determine
custody.
in
the
case
of
the
petitioner,
four
police
officers
went
to
the
petitioner's
home.
they
arrived
about
11:00
at
night.
they
had
guns
drawn
out
of
the
holsters,
in
their
hands,
and
they
knocked
at
the
petitioner's
door.
they
told
him
that
they
wanted
him
to
come
to
the
police
station,
and
i
can
refer
to
the...
in
the
appendix,
there's
a
very
brief
description
of
what
was
said
to
the
petitioner
at
that
time,
and
the
significance
of
this,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
test
that
this
court
has
applied
for
determining
whether
there's
custody
for
the
purpose
of
miranda
is
whether
a
reasonable
person,
in
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant,
believes
that
he
has
a
choice,
and
the
facts
that
i
am
relating
to
you
are
the
facts
from
which
we
would
conclude
that
a
reasonable
person
would
not
believe
that
he
had
a
choice.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
i
believe
the
supreme
court
of
california
stated
the
issue
at
the
beginning
as
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
believe
himself
in
custody,
but
in
fact,
the
analysis
that
that
court
made
of
the
facts
were
focused
almost
entirely
upon
what
was
in
the
policeman's
mind.
they
talked
in
great
deal
about
facts
that
a
reasonable
person,
in
the
petitioner's
mind...
reasonable
person
in
the
petitioner's
standpoint
would
know
nothing
about.
for
example,
why
did
they
take
him
to
the
jail
instead
of
to
the
police
station?
they
talked
about
difficulties
getting
into
the
police
station.
they
talked
about
the
nature
of
the
information
that
was
available
to
the
police
before
they
had
gone
to
pick
him
up.
in
other
words,
the
california
supreme
court,
although
it
mouthed
the
standard
of
a
reasonable
person,
actually
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
that
had
been
made
by
the
trial
court,
and
they
found
only
that
the
trial
court's
conclusion
as
to
when
suspicion
shifted
to
the
petitioner
was
supported
by
the
evidence,
and
that
until
that
point
the
police
officers
would
have
been
willing
to
let
him
go.
at
the
trial,
all
of
his
statements
came
in
through
the
point
that
he
described
the
car.
these
were
used
as
substantive
evidence
of
his
guilt,
and
the
jury
was
instructed
that
if
they
believed
that
he'd
made
false
statements
to
the
police,
that
could
be
considered
as
evidence
of
consciousness
of
guilt.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
real
dispute
between
the
parties
to
the
case
that
the
lower
courts
applied
the
wrong
standard.
the
issue
of
the
focus
of
the
suspicion,
the
extent
to
which
the
police
officers
may
have
suspicion
of
guilt...
it's
a
test
which
may
have
come
from
the
escobedo
case...
has
been
rejected
by
this
court
all
the
way
back
as
far
as
the
beckwith
decision
in
425
u.s.,
and
it
was
made
explicit
in
berkemer.
berkemer
has
said
specifically
that
the
strength
or
content
of
the
government's
suspicion
is
not
material
to
the
issue
of
custody.
now,
it's
very
important--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--the
question
presented,
may
a
trial
court
determine
custody
on
the
basis
of
the
suspicion
in
the
policeman's
mind,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
i
think
that's
correct.
in
choosing
the
correct
standard,
i
think
it's
important
that
the
court
be
aware
that
we
are
not
asking
to
expand
miranda
in
any
way,
or
expand
the
rights
of
criminal
defendants
generally
beyond
what
this
court
has
already
laid
out
in
cases
such
as
berkemer
and
beheler
and
miranda
itself.
berkemer
and
beheler
apply
an
objective
standard.
the
only
relevant
inquiry
in
deciding
custody
is
whether
a
reasonable
person
in
the
position
of
the
suspect
would
have
understood
his
situation,
not
whether
there's
a
formal
arrest,
and
not
whether
the
police
think
he's
in
custody.
the
court
specifically
rejected
arguments
that
the
undisclosed
intentions
of
the
police
are
relevant,
because
as
a
matter
of
logic,
the
police
suspicions
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
concerns
that
moved
the
court
in
miranda,
which
were
that
the
compulsive
effect
of
in
custody
interrogation
is
inherently
coercive,
and
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
court
also
in
berkemer
thought
it
was
not
a
good
idea
to
have
minitrials
on
the
subject
of
what
is
in
the
police
officer's
mind,
which
would
be
decided
primarily
on
self
serving
testimony.
the
principal
difference
between
our
position
and
the
state's,
given
that
the
wrong
standard
was
used,
is
that
the
state
would
look
at
each
of
the
factors
in
this
case
on
what
i
might
call
a
divide
and
conquer
approach.
that
is,
they
pick
up
one
fact,
look
at
it,
say
this
fact
alone
does
not
mean
custody,
put
it
aside,
and
never
think
about
it
again.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
both
the
parties
in
the
case
believe
that
this
court
can
determine
custody
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
i
should
point
out
that--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--this
court
need
not--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--i
don't
think
this
court
need
make
the
determination.
both
parties
have
said
to
the
court
that
they
believe
that
the
court
can
determine
custody
on
this
record.
however,
i
should
point
out
that
the
burden
of
proof
being
on
the
state
to
prove
no
custody,
the
issue
really
is
whether,
on
the
facts
that
are
in
the
record,
the
court
could
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
there
was
no
custody.
if
the
court
cannot
say
that,
then
the
court
should
either
determine
there
was
custody,
or
remand
it
back
to
the
state
courts
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
if
there
were
custody,
the
bottom
line
would
be
that
it
would
go
back
to
the
state
for
a
determination,
presumably,
of
harmless
error.
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
address
prejudice
from
this
point,
because
it
found
there
was
no
error.
it
affirmed
the
finding
that
if
there
had
been
custody
it
did
not...
the
custody
did
not
attach
at
the
time
of
these
statements,
so
it
let
the
statements
in,
and
it
explicitly
declined
to
consider
the
prejudice
question,
and
i
think
it
would...
so
there
is
an
open
harmless
error
question.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
the
focus
is
material
if
it
somehow
conveyed
to
the
individuals
and
it
therefore
influences
what
he
thinks
are
his
rights.
clearly,
if
the
police
have
focused
on
him
to
the
point,
and
have
told
him,
and
he
knows
that
he
would
not
be
free
to
leave,
then
that
of
course
is--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--i
think--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
say
that
the
issue
to
be
looked
at
is
what
was
said
to
the
suspect,
what
moved
him,
what
was
available
for
his
knowledge
in
deciding...
or
to
a
person
who
was
in
his
position,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
he
was
free
to
leave.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
it
could
have,
if
it
were
conveyed
to
him
in
some
fashion,
but
it
would
not
necessarily
be
conveyed
to
him,
and
in
this
case,
there
was
nothing
conveyed
to
him
on
the
issue
of
suspicion,
and
the
trial
court
didn't
find
that
there
was
anything.
the
trial
court
looked
solely
at
what
was
in
the
policeman's
mind
which
was
not
communicated
to
the
suspect,
and
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
policeman
was
aware
that
they
were
looking
for
a
turquoise
car.
the
suspect
mentioned
a
turquoise
car
when
asked,
what
car
did
you
have
available
to
you?
at
that
moment,
according
to
the
trial
court,
suspicion
switched
in
the
policeman's
mind,
but
it
was
nothing
that
was
said
to
the
suspect
that
changed
his
position
in
any
way.
our
position
that
there
was
custody
here
is
based
upon
the
cumulative
effect
upon
a
reasonable
person
in
the
suspect's
position
of
these
factors:
that
he
was
questioned
in
an
8
x
10
foot
room
inside
the
jail
at
pomona.
it's
a
classic
case
of
an
incommunicado,
police-dominated
atmosphere
that
miranda
was
talking
about.
he
had
been
picked
up
at
his
home
late
at
night,
not
on
the
street,
not
in
a
car,
not
in
an
airport...
this
is
not
like
one
of
these
drug
courier
cases.
he
was
confronted
with
officers
with
drawn
guns,
in
any
condition
an
intimidating
show
of
force.
there
were
four
officers
in
two
cars,
much
more
fire
power
than
needed
just
to
give
an
invitation,
the
state's
argument
that
they
were
only
asking
for
him...
his
voluntary
cooperation.
it's
just...
it
was
an
overwhelming
situation.
the
closest
factual
situation
that
we
have
found
in
this
case
is
this
court's
decision
in
dunaway
v.
new
york,
which
was
cited
in
the
briefs.
dunaway,
of
course,
is
a
fourth
amendment
case,
but
it
was
not
as
coercive
as
this
case
because
there
were
no
drawn
guns.
he
was
taken--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
you
would
assume
it's
a
reasonable
innocent
person.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
you
take
that
person
as
coming
to
his
door
and
seeing
four
police
officers
with
guns
in
their
hands
saying...
and
this
is
what
they
said.
the
actual
words
used
were
not
in
the
record,
unfortunately,
but
they
said
they
told
him
that
he
was
possibly
a
witness
to
a
homicide,
and
would
he
come
to
the
pomona
police
department,
and
if
he
didn't
have
transportation,
they
would
provide
it.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
there
was
no
finding
they
were
not
visible.
these
were
45-caliber
pistols.
the
police
were
within
10
feet
of
the
defendant.
they
all
had
their
guns
in
their
hands.
one
of
the
officers
said
he
didn't
draw
his
gun
because
he
then
described...
he
then
defined
the
word
"draw"
to
mean
pointing
at
somebody.
he
said
he
had
his
gun
in
his
hand,
pointed
at
the
ground.
they
did
not
put
their
guns
away
until
after
the
petitioner
came
out
of
his
trailer,
and
there's
a
snippet
of
testimony
on
that
point
that
i
think
is
very
significant,
because
they
were
asked,
"was
there
a
point
in
which
you
put
your
guns
back
in
the
holsters.
"
and
the
officer
said...
and
this
is
at
page
57
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
said,
"i
put
my
gun
away.
"
"the
other
officers
did,
too.
"
"mr.
stansbury
was
very
cooperative.
"
i
don't...
the
inference,
clearly,
is
that
he
saw
the
guns.
the
petitioner
did
not
testify,
however,
so
there
is
no
testimony
that
he
actually
saw
the
guns.
the
question,
i
think,
for
the
court,
is
whether
he
could
have
seen
the
guns,
and
if
a
reasonable
person
could
have
seen
the
guns,
then
whether
mr.
stansbury
actually
saw
them
or
not
is
not
the
issue,
because
the
question
for
the
court
is
to
examine
the
police
conduct
and
examine
whether
the
police
conduct
was
such
that
it
would
persuade
a
reasonable
person
in
the
defendant's
position
that
he
was
not
free
to
make
a
choice.
at
the
time
of
his
interrogation,
he
was
totally
in
the
control
of
the
police,
whether
or
not
they
would
have
released
him
if
he
had
asked
to
be
let
go.
the
fact
is,
he
didn't
ask
to
be
let
go,
and
they
didn't
release
him,
and
in
fact
after
he
described
the
car,
he
was
given
a
miranda
warning,
and
when
he
said
he
thought
he
needed
a
lawyer,
then
he
was
arrested.
looking
at
the
situation
from
the
standpoint
of
somebody
in
the
suspect's
position,
this
case...
there's
simply
no
comparison
between
this
case
and
the
facts
in
mathiason
or
beheler,
on
which
the
state
principally
relies.
both
those
cases
involved
questioning
at
a
police
station.
one
was
a
state
patrol
office...
mathiason...
one
was
a
police
station.
none
of
the
cases
involved
questioning
in
the
jail.
in
both
the
cases
the
individual
had
been
told
specifically
that
he
was
not
under
arrest
and
was
not
in
custody.
in
the
mathiason
case,
in
fact,
the
policeman
had
gone
by
his
house,
left
his
card,
asked
him
to
call
him,
the
individual
called,
he
came
down
voluntarily
to
the
state
patrol
office.
our
case
is
simply...
there's
simply
no
comparison.
now,
i
have
to
say
that
we
don't
have
anything
to
offer
to
the
court
by
way
of
a
bright
line
approach
to
custody.
if
custody
is
going
to
depend
upon
the
reasonable
perception
of
somebody
who
was
situated
as
was
the
individual
in
the
case,
there
simply
isn't
any
way
to
have
a
bright
line
test.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
chesternut
case,
which
has
to
do
with
fourth
amendment
seizure,
which
incidentally
the
test
for
fourth
amendment
seizure
is
worded
almost
exactly
the
way
this
court
has
worded
the
test
for
custody...
that
is,
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
feel
free
to
leave...
the
court
describes
the
test
as
necessarily
imprecise.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
i
have
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
that
is
correct.
the
court
says
that.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
my
answer
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
although
the
court
made
that
statement
on
page
471,
the
bulk
of
the
discussion
by
the
court
of
the
issue
is
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge
about
suspicion
in
the
policeman's
mind
focusing
on
the
petitioner,
and
the
court
deals
at
great
length
with
that
point.
the
court
does
not
find...
the
court...
and
the
california
supreme
court
does
not
make
findings
of
fact.
there
was
only
one
finding
of
fact...
there
was
only
one
fact-finder
here,
and
that
was
the
trial
court,
and
there
was
only
one
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court,
and
that
was
when
suspicion
focused
in
the
policeman's
mind.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
the
trial
court
actually
did
suppress
part
of
the
statements,
so
you
cannot
draw
a
conclusion
that
the
court
made
a
finding...
i
would
say
that
the
court
made
a
finding
that
the
petitioner
was
in
custody
at
the
end
of
the
interview,
because
it
suppressed
what
he
said
after
he
had
described
the
car,
and
yet
the
physical
surroundings,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
in
jail,
had
not
changed,
so
we
have
a
bizarre
situation
where
the
court
has
found
custody,
but
found
that
it
attached
at
a
particular
point
in
time,
based
on
its
view
of
when
the
policeman's
mind
registered
a
certain
level
of
suspicion.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
absolutely
right.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
there's
no
question
about
that.
there
is,
however,
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
any
change
in
what
was
communicated
to
the
defendant.
the
record
is...
one
of
the
problems
with
the
case
is
that
the
record
is
somewhat
faulty,
and
that
puts
us
back
to
the
question
of
who
had
the
burden
of
proving
the
issue
of
custody.
there
is
one
case,
the
berkemer
case,
which
we've
referred
to,
which
suggests
that
for
purposes
of
custody,
you
apply
a
slightly
different
test
than
you
would
apply
for
purposes
of
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
berkemer
was
of
course
a
traffic
stop
case,
and
the
court
said
that
it
was
not
enough
in
a
traffic
stop
that
a
defendant
feel
he
may
not
be
free
to
leave.
he
may
have
been...
the
test
for
seizure
being
whether
the
defendant
feels
he's
free
to
leave,
that
is
not
enough
for
custody,
because
there
must
in
addition
be
a
restraint
of
a
nature
that
is
associated
with
a
formal
arrest.
in
this
case,
we've
met
the
condition
of
berkemer.
we
have
a
situation
where
i
think
a
person
who's
in
an
8
x
10
foot
room
in
the
jail
clearly
is
unable
to
leave,
at
least
without
the
help
of
the
police.
he
wasn't
told
that
he
was
entitled
to
any
help
from
the
police.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
that's
a
very...
there's
no
evidence
as
to
whether
the
room
was
locked.
the
supreme
court
of
california
thought
the
room
was
locked,
and
said
the
room
was
locked
in
its
opinion.
the
evidence
on
the
question
is
that
one
of
the
police
officers
was
asked
if
it
was
locked
and
said
he
couldn't
remember
whether
it
was
locked.
petitioner
did
not
testify.
if
this
court
thinks
it's
important
as
to
whether
the
room
was
locked...
of
course,
the
jail
was
locked.
he
went
in
through
the
sally
port
of
the
jail...
rolling
cages
come
behind
the
car,
he
went
through
several
steel
doors,
all
with
locks.
whether
the
court
thinks
its
important
that
this
room
was
locked,
then
i
would
say
that
the
state
hasn't
met
it's
burden
of
proof,
because--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--they
did
not...
because
one
of
the
questions--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--the
state
would
have
to
put
on--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--it
was
inside
the
jail,
however.
it
was
not
just
a
police
department
office.
it
was
inside
the
jail.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
the
officer
was
asked,
was
the
door
locked,
and
said,
"i
don't
remember".
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
it
was
very
clear--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--it
was
very
clear
that
he
could
not
have
left
the
premises
without
keys
being
provided.
now...
because
it
was
inside
the
jail.
all
of
the
doors
in
the
jail
are
opened
only
by
keys,
and
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
completely
within
the
control
of
the
police.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
that
is
true--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--well,
i
think
the
question,
justice
scalia,
would
be
whether
the
reasonable
policeman
would
think
that
he's
in
custody
because
be
has
to
ask
for
a
key,
and
i
don't
think
he
would.
this
man
was
not
a
policeman.
he
had
been
brought
down
there
at
11:00
at
night
from
his
home.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
westberg.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
mr.
chief
justice,
justice
stevens,
the
supreme
court
said
at
page
471
that
focus
was
one
of
the
most
important
factors,
and
they
listed
the
focus
of
the
degree
of
suspicion.
after
it
made
the
general
statement
about
the
reasonable
person
standard,
it's
obvious
that
they
looked
at
focus
as
one
of
the
most
important,
and
it
was
in
fact
key
to
the
trial
judge.
your
honors,
the
argument
that
there
was
a
disclosure
to
this
petitioner
that
he
was
only
a
witness
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
he
was
told
that
he
was
a
witness,
and
at
one
time
that
he
was
possibly
a
witness,
but
he
was
never
told
that
he
was
only
a
witness.
in
fact,
the
record
doesn't
even
show
what
was
actually
said
to
him,
and
that
may
be
the
most
important
thing
that
would
influence
a
reasonable
person,
but
unfortunately
this
record
simply
has
a
description
of
the
police
officers,
of
what
they
said,
and
there
are
only
four
pages
in
the
record
that
bear
on
this...
pages
36
and
37--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--under
people
v.
sam,
california
has
allocated
that
burden
to
the
state
to
demonstrate
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony,
and
in
fact,
in
people
v.
sam,
california
supreme
court
cited
in
the
brief,
the
respondent
does
not
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
state
in
this
proceeding.
we
made
that
point
in
our
opening
brief.
they
have
not
said
that--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--to
show
that
he
was
not
in
custody.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--california
law,
i
think--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--certainly
not.
this
court
i
think
would
leave
it
to
the
states
to
allocate
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
that
it
was
required
by
this
court,
or
unless
they
did
it
in
a
way
that
this
court
thought
deprived
constitutional
rights,
but
in
this
case
they've
allocated
it
to
the
state.
there
was
nothing
said
to
him...
there's
nothing...
no
evidence
of
what
was
said
to
him
in
the
interview
room,
as
well
as
no
evidence
of
what
was
said
to
him
at
the
trailer,
except
for
the
four
pages
in
the
joint
appendix,
36
and
37,
and
56
and
57,
that
contains
the
description
of
the
words
that
were
expressed.
we
certainly
don't
argue
that
mathiason
or
beheler
should
be
overruled.
it's
not
our
view
at
all,
and
those
cases
are
totally
different.
in
both
of
those
cases
the
police
made
clear
what
the
status
of
the
citizen
was.
one
characterization
of
the
state's
argument
is
that
it's
up
to
the
citizen
to
make
clear
what
his
status
is,
so
when
you
come
to
the
door
and
there
are
people
with
guns
in
their
hands,
you
are
supposed
to
say,
am
i
under
arrest,
do
i
have
a
choice,
and
i
think
that's
just
a
totally...
it's
a
dangerous
proposition
as
well
as
a
totally
unreasonable
proposition,
but
in
both
mathiason
and
beheler
the
police
said,
you
are
not
under
arrest,
and
in
fact
in
both
cases
they
completely
had
the
cnoice.
the
argument
that
there
was
nothing
threatening
here
when
he
made
his
agreement
to
transportation
to
go
to
the
police
station,
the
answer
to
that
is,
there
were
four
officers
on
his
porch
at
11:00
at
night
with
guns,
and
what
would
a
reasonable
person
do?
the
point
as
to
the
brevity
of
the
questioning,
it
was...
the
record
showed
it
was
20
to
30
minutes.
that
might
show
lack
of
custody
if
they
let
him
go
at
the
end
of
20
to
30
minutes.
in
this
case,
they
arrested
him
at
the
end
of
the
20
or
30
minutes.
we
think
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
he
was
not
in
custody,
and
that
therefore
this
court's
choice
under
its
own
precedents
would
be
either
to
find
that
he
was
in
custody,
which
i
think
is
indicated
from
berkemer,
because
he
was
(a)
in
the
jail
and
(b)
he
was
in
a
situation
where
a
reasonable
person
would
think
he
couldn't
leave.
now,
that's
tantamount
to
a
formal
arrest,
but--
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
--i
would
agree.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
m.
westberg
thank
you.
