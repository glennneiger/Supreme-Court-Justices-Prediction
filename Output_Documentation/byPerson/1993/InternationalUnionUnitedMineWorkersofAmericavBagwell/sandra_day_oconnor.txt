mr.
gold,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
defendant
has
to
continue
to
have
an
opportunity
to
avoid
payment
of
the
fine
in
order
for
it
to
be
classified
as
civil?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
hard
and
fast
test,
in
your
view,
of
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
your
position
that
that's
a
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
can
that
ever
be
coercive?
i
mean,
if
a
defendant
can
always
avoid
it
by
eventually
doing
the
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
your
response
is
that
it
also
depends
upon
whether
it's
mandatory
or
prohibitory--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
suppose
in
this
case
there
were
both
types
of
things
involved.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
this
case,
this
very
case,
do
you
say
that
the
fines
could
be
imposed
insofar
as
they
applied
to
those
things
that
the
union
was
asked
to
do
separate
and
apart
from
violent
acts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-hum.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
roberts,
it
was,
of
course,
raised
in
their
application
to
the
state
court.
it's
hard
to
say
that
it
was
waived.
they
didn't
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
it,
but
what
if
we
have
to
reach
it,
as
i
think
we
probably
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
this
court
ever
said
the
excessive
fines
clause
is
incorporated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
we
should?
is
it
appropriate
that
we
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
what
are
those
rules?
is
it
a
matter
of
the
due
process
clause
and
is
it
procedural?
