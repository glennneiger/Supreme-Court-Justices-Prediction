mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
cases
have
steadily
recognized,
and
i
think
everybody
in
this
case
agrees,
that
the
traditional
use
of
civil
contempt
to
coerce
a
recalcitrant
party
or
witness
into
doing
something
that
the
court
wants
them
to
do,
traditionally
by
putting
him
in
jail
until
he
does
it,
more
recently
by
fines
that
accumulate
until
he
or
she
does
it,
that
that's
constitutional,
whether
done
in
a
state
or
federal
court.
the
question
in
this
case,
as...
i
think
the
central
question
in
this
case,
as
justice
ginsburg
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
the
argument,
is
with
prohibitory
injunctions,
where
do
we
draw
the
line
between
those
which
are
constitutional
and
those
which
are
not?
that
there
are
constitutional
rules
i
think
is
reflected
in
this
court's
decision
in
hicks,
which
was
a
state
case
and
which
mentioned
that
there
are
constitutional
rules.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
due
process
and
i
think
it
is
procedural,
yes.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
in
addition
to
the
traditional
use
of
civil
contempt
in
the
coercive
manner
i
just
mentioned,
there
are
at
least
two
other
areas
where
civil
contempt
has
traditionally
been
used
and
which
this
court
should
recognize
as
being
constitutional
uses
of
civil
contempt.
one
the
court
has
explicitly
recognized
over
and
over
again,
and
that
is
that
civil
contempt
can
be
used
in
civil
litigation
to
compensate
a
party
for
damages
done
to
that
party
by
the
other
party
who
violates
the
injunction.
mr.
paul
bender
it
may
not
be,
and
it
may
be
that
any
time
a
judge
announces
that
he
is
proceeding
by
way
of
civil
contempt
and
that
the
penalties
are
going
to
be
imposed
civilly,
that
that's
constitutional.
even--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes.
i
think
it's
easier
to
look
at
it
in
terms
of
some
things
which,
if
they're
present,
it's
clear
that
you
can
operate
civilly.
and
i
think
this
case
falls
within
one
of
those
categories.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
essentially,
what
falls
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
are
prohibitory,
if
there
is
another
side
of
the
line.
and
i
think
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
points
out,
it's
conceivable
that
this
court
could
hold
that
any
time
a
judge
characterizes
the
proceedings
as
civil,
they
should
be
treated...
that
should
be
treated
as
constitutional.
there
are
benefits
to
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
even--
mr.
paul
bender
--my
own
view
is
that
there
is
a
core
of
contempt
which
must
be
treated
criminally.
and
within
that
core,
i
would
think,
are
acts
which
are
malum
in
se,
the
kinds
of
acts
which
have
traditionally
been
treated
criminally
by
the
law.
and,
clearly,
i
think
within
that
category
would
be
punishments
like
going
to
jail
for
committing
such
an
act.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
not
a
definition.
it's...
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--yeah,
and
i
think
it
is...
i
think
it's
better
to
put
it
the
other
way
around,
that
there
are
at
least
two
categories
of
cases--
mr.
paul
bender
--all
right.
i
think
there
are
at
least
two
categories
of
cases
where
civil
contempt
can
be
used
by
a
court.
one
is
where
it's
used
to
compensate
one
of
the
parties.
if
i...
if
i,
as
a
judge,
enjoin
you
not
to
cut
down
your
neighbor's
trees,
and
you
nevertheless
go
ahead
and
cut
down
your
neighbor's
trees,
one
thing
the
judge
can
do,
i
think,
is
to
award
your
neighbor
civil
contempt
damages,
compensatory
damages
for
what
you
did.
and
that
shouldn't...
that
shouldn't
surprise
us.
it's
very
similar
to
tort
damages.
on
tort
proceedings
which
are
civil,
you
can
have
even
punitive
damages.
so
the
use
of
civil
contempt
in
that
situation,
the
court
has
recognized
over
and
over
again
that
the
compensatory
use
of
civil
contempt
is
also
constitutional.
there's
a
second
category
which
i
think
is
closer
to
this
case,
and
which
is,
i
think,
the
leading
example
of
it,
is
the
national
labor
relations
board's
use
of
civil
contempt.
as
this
court
has
recognized
over
and
over
again,
there
are
areas
of
regulation
of
conduct
that
the
government
may
proceed
in
civilly
rather
than
criminally.
the
court's
osha
cases
show
that,
for
example.
as
i
said,
the
court's
national
labor
relations
board
cases
show
that
most
prominently.
where
the
court
has
said,
for
example,
in
republic
steel,
the
act
is
essentially
remedial;
it
does
not
carry
a
penal
program.
it
is
perfectly
constitutional
for
a
legislature
to
decide
to
regulate
something
civilly,
and
labor
relations
are
one
of
the
prime
areas
where
that
is
possible.
so
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
constitutionally
be
given
the
power
itself
to
levy
civil
penalties
for
violations
of
the
act.
mr.
paul
bender
congress'
labeling,
i
think,
clearly
is
sufficient.
if
congress
says,
as
it
has
to
the
board,
we
want
you
to
act
civilly
rather
than
criminally.
and
there
are
lots
of
reasons
why
congress
might
want
to
do
that.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it
clearly
is
in
a
situation
where
the
legislature
has
said
that
that's
the
way
the
government
wants
to
proceed.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
yeah,
the
national
labor
relations
board
does
that
all
the
time.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
you
do
either
to
a
creation
by
a
district
judge.
but
this
case
involves
a
state
doing
it,
and
as
the
court
said
in
hicks,
if
a
state
characterizes
its
procedures
as
civil,
the
court
ought
to
defer
to
that
unless
it's
clearly
shown
that
they
aren't
civil
in
character.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
the
state
could
do
what
the
federal
government
has
done
and
decide
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
a
behavior
in
a
strike
situation
civilly
rather
than
criminally,
and
pass
a
statute
authorizing
a
state
agency,
and
i
think
authorizing
the
agency
to
go
to
court
for
enforcement
of
its
orders,
to
operate
civilly
rather
than
criminally,
because
that's
the
kind
of
thing
where
that
choice
is
available.
this
case
is
more
difficult
than
that
because
in
this
case
the
state
doesn't
have
a
statute
like
that.
but
the
judge
said
at
the
outset
that
he
was
proceeding
civilly;
i
think
trying
to
do
it
in
the
same
way
the
national
labor
relations
board--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes.
mr.
paul
bender
the
government
can
be
a
civil
party,
and
the
state
in
this
case,
or
the
judge
in
this
case
treated...
and
so
did
the
virginia
supreme
court,
treated
the
governments,
the
county
and
the
state,
as
being
parties
to
the
case.
that's
unusual,
but
i
don't
think
it's
unconstitutional.
and
so
i
think
what
the
judge
did
here
was
treat
the
governmental
entities
as
civil
parties,
and
he
decided
he
was
proceeding
by
way
of
civil
procedures
in
the
same
way
the
national
labor
relations
board
proceeded
against
exactly
the
same
strike
by
way
of
federal
civil
proceedings.
and--
mr.
paul
bender
--that's
true.
i
agree
with
you,
it's
extremely
unusual.
i
don't
think
it
would
happen
in
federal
court.
but
that's
not
the
question
in
this
case.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
it's
constitutional
for
the
state
to
do
that.
has
the
state
passed
the
line?
and
the
court
said
in
hicks
that
there
are
constitutional
rules,
but
we
don't
find
the
state
has
violated
them
unless
it's
extremely
clear
that
the
state
has
violated
them.
and
the
question
for
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
it
is
that
extremely
clear?
mr.
paul
bender
that
is
a
constitutional
way
of
using
civil
contempt,
yes.
and
since
it
has
been...
it
has
been
happening
and
used
by
the
federal
government
for
many,
many
years,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
the
state
is
automatically
disentitled
to
do
that.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
has
done
things
in
enough
of
a
similar
way?
and
there
are
a
number
of
similarities
here.
the
affirmative
nature
of
some
of
the
injunctions
is
part
of
it.
