mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
grows
out
of
a
strike
and
ensuing
equity
proceeding
to
enjoin
various
kinds
of
wrongdoing
and
a
series
of
contempt
proceedings
which
have
generated
huge
fines.
the
essential
first
question
posed
by
the
case
is
whether
this...
these
fines
were
criminal
fines
which
could
only
be
imposed
through
criminal
contempt
and
through
procedures
which
meet
the
requirements
of
criminal
due
process,
most
particularly
the
right
to
jury.
this
is
not
a
new
question
in
this
court,
and
we
rely
on
statements
of
the
essential
rules
going
back
to
1911
in
the
gompers
case,
and
rules
which
have
been
restated
and
reaffirmed
as
recently
as
the
fiat
case
in
485
u.s.--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--we
think
that
that
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--we
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
underlying
points
which
leads
to
what
we
understand
to
be
the
basic
point
when
you're
dealing
with
fines
and
imprisonment.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the...
when
i
say
that
it
has
to
be
avoidable,
what
it...
what
i
understand
the
cases
to
say
is
that
in
a
situation
in
which
a
fine
or
a...
an
imprisonment
is
imposed
in
order
to
coerce
an
act,
where
that
is
done
to
coerce
a
discrete
affirmative
act,
there
is
a
sense
in
which
the
individual
has...
to
use
the
phrase
which
runs
from
the
beginning
and
the...
to
the
end
of
these
cases,
has
the
keys
to
the
prison
or
the...
to
his
own
strongbox
in
his
hands,
in
a
way
which
is
different
from
the
situation
in
which
there
is
a
prohibition
and
an
alleged
violation
of
the
prohibition.
the
effort
is
to
secure
a
discrete
act
from
the
individual.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
and
in
that...
in
that
sense,
justice
o'connor,
the
first
of
the
arguments
we
make
is
first
because
it
raises
the
larger,
more
general
question.
but
it
is,
for
our
purposes,
narrower
in
its
effect
than
the
second
argument
we
make
on
the
effect
of
settlement.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
we
acknowledge...
we
take
the
sweet
with
the
sour
in
terms
of
the
law
as
it's
developed,
a
law
which
distinguishes
between
the
ability
of
the
courts
to
coerce
discrete
acts
that
provide
a
unique
benefit
to
the
plaintiff
and
rules
which
have
to
do
with
the
statement
of
prohibitions
in
court
orders
and
the
levying
of
fines
or
imprisonment
for
violating
those
orders.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
opinion
in
gompers
talks
about
the
rules
being
rules
of
constitutional
import
having
to
do
with,
as
the
phrase
in
the
case,
substantive
rights
and
constitutional
privileges.
and
certainly
hicks
v.
fiat
comes
out
of
the
california
courts
and
applies
the
same
rules
and
the
pivotal
case
for
our
purposes
here,
bloom
v.
illinois,
is
a
constitutional
case.
we
understand
the
test
or
the
general
rule
that
is
stated
in
gompers
and
reaffirmed
in
hicks,
to
have
three
wellsprings
and
to
serve
three
purposes.
first
of
all,
it
captures
the
essence
of
the
historic
distinction
between
criminal
contempt
and
civil
contempt.
secondly,
it
takes
proper
cognizance,
as
gompers
says,
of
the
substantive
rights
and
constitutional
privileges
at
stake.
and
finally,
as
bloom
emphasizes,
it
gives
due
weight
to
the
apprehensions
about
an
unbridled
contempt
power
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
can
only
judge
by
our
understanding
of
the
words
in
the
u.s.
reports.
the
distinction
is
one
which
serves
to
demark
the
line
between
criminal
contempt,
which
is
governed
by
criminal
due
process
requirements.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i...
well,
two...
two
points
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
one,
when
we
talk
about
mandatory
and
prohibitory,
as
this
court
has
talked
about,
and
it
is
the
distinction
between
prohibiting
someone
from
acting
in
a
way
which
is
harmful
or
wrongful
and
ordering
someone
to
act
in
a...
do
particular
discrete
acts.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
your--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--two...
two
points,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
we
believe
these
distinctions
that
we're
discussing
here,
and
which
are
labeled
prohibitory
and
mandatory
and,
as
you
say,
involve
stop
orders,
deal
with
the
question
of
fines
and
imprisonment.
there
are
other...
obviously,
there
are
other
ways
to
back
up
a
stop
order,
various
kinds
of
compensatory
and
remedial
orders
which
are
designed
to
provide
the
complaining
party
with
the
rights
and
benefits
that
the
order
specifies.
secondly,
the
stop
order
can
be
backed
up
by
various
well
crafted,
affirmative
orders
which
can
be
enforced
through
coercive
means
under
the
established
tests.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i'm
not
familiar
with
the
particulars
of
the
patco
orders.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
your
honor.
and
whether
it
is
not
to...
whether--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the...
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
underlying
point
is
prohibitory.
it
seems
to...
and
i
would
say--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the...
i
think
it
makes
sense
in
terms
of
the
underlying
theory
of
the
distinction,
justice
scalia.
the...
in
the
same
way
as
you've
just
stated,
an
order...
instead
of
phrasing
an
order
not
to
take
action
which
is
injurious
to
the
plaintiff,
you
can
say
only
do
things
which
are
beneficial
to
the
plaintiff,
or
do
not
do
things.
but
the
underlying
point
remains
the
same,
and
i
can
only
say
that
against
a
background
where
the
criminal
law
is
a
law
of
prohibition
enforced
through
retribution
and
deterrence,
the
test
is
a
test
which
is
as
sound
as
can
be
divined.
after
all,
gompers
itself
was
a
boycott
case.
the
court
had
no
trouble
distinguishing
between
prohibiting
boycotting
activity,
which
could
be
phrased
affirmatively
or
negatively--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
i
think
the
argument
for
this
distinction
is
very
much
like
the
churchillian
argument
for
democracy;
it
is
superior
to
the
alternatives.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
our
first
argument
most
definitely
rest
on
what
would--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--in
terms
of
our
first
argument,
we
are
left
with
nothing
other
than
the
complete
lack
of
any
principle
differentiating
content
in
the
standard
applied
by
the
virginia
courts
and
urged
by
the
respondents.
according
to
them,
whether
the
underlying
order
is
prohibitory
or
mandatory,
whether
it
has
the
essence
and
substance
of
traditional
criminal
law,
whether
it
is
enforced
by
fines
or
imprisonment,
so
long
as,
quote,
the
penalty
is
scheduled
in
advance,
it
is
civil,
and
if
it
is
not,
it
is
criminal.
the
prohibitory-mandatory
approach
is
an
effort
to
deal
with
a
certain
measure
of
overlap
between
the
purposes
and
effect
of
a,
quote,
coercive
fine
or
a
coercive
imprisonment,
and
a,
quote,
criminal
fine
or
criminal
imprisonment,
and
recognizes
that
both
have
elements
of
providing
benefit
to
the
plaintiff,
vindicating
the
authority
of
the
law
and
providing
measures
of
retribution
and
deterrence.
and
if--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--our
view
is
that
if
that
line
is
rejected,
then
you
have
to
go
to
the
highest
level
distinction,
which
is
the
distinction
between
proceedings
which
are
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
courts
and
the
law,
versus
proceedings
which
are
to
provide
a
definite
unique
benefit
to
the
plaintiff
that
is,
in
a
real
sense,
different
from
the
overall
effort
to
maintain
peace
and
social
value.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
think
that,
far
better
than
i've
been
able
to
do
so
far,
that
exposes
the
nature
of
the
problem.
to
say
that
if,
ex
ante,
you
enter
an
order,
do
not
harm
the
plaintiff,
and
say
if
you
do,
you
will
be
fined
$100,000...
to
say
that
that
is
a
situation
which
is
different
from
the
following:
you
enter
an
order
saying
do
not
harm
the
plaintiff,
actions
are
taken
which
harm
the
plaintiff,
a
proceeding
is
begun
in
contempt,
and
a
fine
of
$100,000
is
imposed.
to
say
that
those
are
different,
the
first
civil,
the
second
has
always
been
criminal,
is
to
deny
that
the
criminal
law,
with
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
other
statement,
prior
statements
of
both
the
norm
and
the
sanction,
is
somehow
civil.
and
that,
we
think,
leaves
the
underlying
constitutional
values,
which
we
have
not
talked
about,
and
i
am
only
going
to
talk
about
for
a
minute,
completely
unprotected.
after
all,
there
are
two
social
values
here.
one,
the
basic
social
values
which
provide
a
heightened
degree
of
due
process
for
the
imposition
of
certain
forms
of
penalties.
and
secondly,
the
particular
concern
of
the
contempt
procedure,
which
is
one
which
conflates
all
the
power
of
government
into
a
single
individual
which
varies
in
a
way
which
is
contrary
to
the
whole
notion
of
protecting
against
improper
incursions
on
liberty
by
separating
the
powers
of
government.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
history
of
the
doctrine,
to
date,
has
been,
as
we
understand
it,
precisely
the
opposite,
justice
souter.
it
has
been
the
recognition
that
the
fact
that
the
judge
issued
the
order
creates
grave
risks
that,
in
dealing
with--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i'd
like
to
move
on
to
the
second
argument.
before
i
do,
let
me
simply
say
that
if
that's
true,
there
is
no
room
for
a
criminal
contempt.
and
it
is
the
starting
point
of
every
case
in
this
court,
from
gompers
through
dixon,
is
that
there
is
an
area
of...
called
criminal
contempt
which
must
proceed
under
constitutional
due
process
standards.
let
me
talk
about
the
second
question
presented.
in
the
second
question--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--absolutely.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the...
that
characterization,
i
think,
is...
of
the
process
is
the
respondents'.
but
in
terms
of
your
point,
we
do
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
most
general
proposition,
that
criminal
contempt
is
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
law
and
the
court,
versus
civil
contempt,
which
is
to
bring
about
the
benefits
of
the
order
to
the
plaintiff
in
a
remedial
fashion,
then
law,
any
rule
which
says
that
the
plaintiff
is
not
master
of
the
case
and
cannot
settle
it
and
it
is
not
inherent
in
the
case,
that
satisfaction
to
the
plaintiff
is
not
enough,
is
a
hallmark
of
criminal
contempt,
if
there
is
no
other
hallmark
of
criminal
contempt.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
would
not--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
we
would
say
that
any
case...
we
would
say
that
any
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
can
waive...
let
me
just
put
it
in
these
terms.
i
hadn't
thought
of
it
exactly
as
you
said
it,
but
it
is
true,
from
gompers
on,
that
criminal
contempt
cannot
be
settled
by
the
putative
private
plaintiff,
and
in
that
sense
i
agree
totally
with
what
you
said.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
thank
you,
your
honor.
let
me
begin
by
responding
to
the
last
point
mr.
bender
makes...
made,
and
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
13
of
our
reply
brief
and
note
9.
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
virginia
court
decisions
or
opinions
which
treats
the
state
or
the
counties
as
parties.
it
was
the
court
itself
becoming
a
party
through
a
special
master--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--right.
and--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
beyond
that...
that
point,
with
which
i
agree
insofar
as
it's
a
debater's
point
rather
than
a
prediction,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
100
people
could
disagree
which
way
you
deter
most
effectively:
by
saying,
as
justice
souter
did,
if
you
do
what
i
have
prohibited
you
from
doing,
there
will
be
very
serious
penalties,
or
saying
the
maximum
penalty
would
be
$100,000.
to
say
that
one
is
an
indicia
of
a
remedial
intent
and
the
other
of
a
punitive,
retributive
intent,
as
we
attempt
to
argue,
just
will
not
wash.
beyond
that,
let
me
say
that
unless...
there
are
two
things
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
my
brother
said.
mr.
bender
began
by
talking
about
compensatory
relief.
we
have
stated
in
every
paper
filed
that
the
provision
of
compensatory
relief,
generously
conceived,
is
the
province
of
civil
contempt.
we're
talking
about
noncompensatory
fines,
payable
to
the
state,
growing
out
of
a
private
lawsuit,
or
imprisonment.
secondly,
mr.
roberts,
unless
i
mistake
him,
suggested
that
there's
a
line
between
wrongs
that
are
malum
in
se
and
other
wrongs.
what
the
underlying
wrongs
here
alleged
were
violence,
vandalism,
and
so
on.
and
finally,
it
is
of
the
essence
that
the
issues
to
be
decided
were
not
issues
of
the
kind
that
were
in
the
history
of
equity:
provide
these
papers,
do
this,
do
that.
the
union
argued
that
such
wrongs
as
were--
