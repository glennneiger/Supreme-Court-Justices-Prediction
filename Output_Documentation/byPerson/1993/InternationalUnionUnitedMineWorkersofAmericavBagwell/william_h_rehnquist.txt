we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
92-1625
the
international
union,
united
mine
workers
of
america
v.
john
l.
bagwell.
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold--
--mr.
gold,
how
much
of
the
law
that
you're
talking
about
is
constitutional
law
which
would
be
imposed
on
the
states
by
the
con,
and
how
much
of
it
is
just
federal
court
law.
i
mean,
gompers,
for
example,
was
a
federal
court
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
think
that
the
constitution
enjoins
a
distinction
between
the
mandatory
provisions
of
an
injunction
and
the,
you
know,
prohibitive,
prohibitory.
the...
i
thought
that
distinction
was
pretty
much
discounted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
it
a
fact,
mr.
gold,
that
a
court
can
turn
anything
from
mandatory
into
prohibitory
just
by
a
matter
of
phrasing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
bender,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bender,
let
me
interrupt
you
for
a
moment.
you
say
a
constitutional
use
of
civil
contempt,
but
it's
quite
possible
to
read
our
cases,
is
it
not,
as
saying
that
the
distinction
between...
there
is
a
constitutional
decision
between
criminal
contempt
and
civil
contempt,
because
criminal
contempt
requires
the
invocation
of
certain
procedural
safeguards,
like
a
jury
trial?
but
i
don't
read
that
as
connoting
that
there's
some
constitutional
limitation
on
civil
contempt
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
mr.
gold,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
