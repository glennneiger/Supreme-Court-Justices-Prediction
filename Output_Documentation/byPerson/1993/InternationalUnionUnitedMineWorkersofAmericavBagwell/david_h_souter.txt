justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
the
order...
an
appropriate
order
is
issued
not
to
strike,
which
is,
in
effect,
to
continue
to
work,
that
that
cannot
be
enforced
with
a
coercive
and
still
civil
fine
for
each
day
in
which
they
refuse
to
return?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
take...
i'm
sorry.
you
take
the
position
that
that
is
not
a...
that
that
enforcement
is
not
subject
to
a
civil
coercive
fine?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
you
speak
of
as
the
single
individual
is,
in
fact,
the
court.
and
the
court,
in
fact,
has
a
position
in
these
cases
which
is
different
from
the
court
in
a
normal
criminal
case,
or
indeed
from
a
normal
civil
case.
because
the
court,
in
effect,
has...
by
issuing
an
injunction,
has
become
an
actor
and,
in
effect,
has
created
a
public
stake
which
doesn't
exist
in
your
two
other
extreme
examples.
so
there's
nothing
unreasonable,
on
the
face
of
it,
to
say
that
there
should
be
a
particular
process,
and
not
necessarily
a
criminal
one,
to
protect
that...
that
third
and
different
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
will
grant
you
that
it
does
create
grave
risks.
but
i'm
saying...
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
existence
of
that
risk
is
not
dispositive,
because
that
risk
is
still,
as
it
were,
sort
of
the
unfortunate
reflection
of
a
third
interest
which
does
not
occur
in
the
run
of
the
mill
criminal
case
or
the
run
of
the
mill
civil
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
only
difference
is
he
makes
a
speech
to
the
defendant,
as
opposed,
in
effect,
to
deeming
that
the
defendant
knows
the
criminal
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
seems
to
me
a
totally
formalistic
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see...
i
see
it's
narrowing,
but
i'm
not
sure
why
its
narrowing
makes
it
coercive,
and
i
don't
see
what
the
extra
element
of
coercion
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
but
if
a
judge
is
sentencing
an
individual
for
a
violation
of
the
criminal
law
and
says
don't
let
me
see
you
here
again
or
i'll
throw
the
book
at
you,
that
doesn't
convert
the
second
proceeding,
if
he
does
come
back,
into
a
civil
proceeding,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
distinction
is
between
that
and
what
you're
proposing
for
us
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
board,
in
effect,
can
do
just
what
you
were
saying
or
suggesting
the
judge
might
be
able
to
do
at
the
beginning,
and
that
is
to
say
we're
telling
you
right
now
that
when
we
coerce,
it's
civil
coercion.
and
that
announcement,
that
labeling
is
sufficient.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if...
what
if
a
judge
announces
this
labeling
and
he
says,
look,
i'm
not
going
to
mix
myself
up
in
this
labor
dispute
or
this
custody
dispute.
i'm
simply
going
to
issue
the
order,
and
at
some
point
it's
going
to
be
resolved,
but
i'm
telling
you
right
now
that
if
you
do
not
do
what
i
order
you
to
do,
or
if
you
fail
or
if
you
do
what
i
order
you
not
to
do,
when
it's
all
over
i'm
going
to
levy
fines
on
the
following
fine
schedule,
and
they're...
they're
going
to
be...
they're
just
going
to
be
civil
fines,
i'm
telling
you
that
right
now.
is
that
sufficient
to
give
it
a
conclusively
civil
character?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
though
there's
nothing...
nothing
left
to
converse...
to
coerce.
