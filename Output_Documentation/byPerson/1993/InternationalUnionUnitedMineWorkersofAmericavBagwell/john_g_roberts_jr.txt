chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
virginia
supreme
court
correctly
determined,
in
accord
with
every
federal
court
of
appeals
to
have
considered
this
question,
that
contempt
sanctions
of
the
sort
at
issue
here
are
civil
in
nature.
this
court
has
explained
that
we
should
look
to
the
substance
of
the
proceeding
in
classifying
contempts
as
civil
or
criminal.
here
the
defendant
violated
an
injunction
repeatedly.
the
defendant
was
brought
before
the
court
and
the
judge
said
you've
violated
this
injunction,
and
to
get
you
to
stop
violating
it
and
start
complying
with
it
in
the
future,
i'm
going
to
fine
you
so
much
for
every
future
violation.
these
fines
are
prospective
and
you
can
avoid
them
completely
by
complying
with
the
injunction.
i
hope
this
will
deter
future
violations.
now--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
general,
i
think
that's
correct.
you
need
to
have
a
situation
where
the
judge
specifies
in
advance
a
warning
to
the
defendant
to
coerce
him.
i
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
constitutional
values
that
are
served
is
that
your...
the
bill
of
rights
protections
that
the
union
is
saying
it
wasn't
granted
are
applicable
only
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
one
brought
to
punish.
if
the
proceeding
is
not
one
brought
to
punish,
it's
not
a
criminal
proceeding
and
then
those
protections
are
not
applicable.
the
question
instead
is
is
the
proceeding
coercive
and
remedial,
as
opposed
to
punitive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
they
do
have
general
coercive
aspects.
it
looks
more
remedial
in
the
sense
that
it
is
specified
and
focused
on
a
particular
defendant.
because
in
the
situation
you
posit,
what
the
judge
is
going
to
do
after
the
violation
is
set
the
fine
based
on
the
violation,
look
to
the
past.
what
he's
doing
here
is
looking
to
the
future.
he's
not
saying
you've
done
terrible
things
and
this
is
what
you're
going
to
pay.
he's
saying
i
want
to
get
you
to
stop
doing
those
things,
and
this
is
what
i
think
it
will
take.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
not
a
formalistic
distinction,
your
honor,
in
this
respect;
the
general
criminal
law
does
have
deterrent
effect.
it
applies
to
everyone,
a
general
deterrence.
here
we're
talking
about
a
specific
defendant
whose
conduct
is...
has
risen
to
a
level
that
an
injunction's
been
entered
against
him.
it's
been
narrowed
down
to
that
defendant.
and
when
the
judge...
and
that
defendant
then
violates
the
order
again.
and
when
the
judge
says
this
is
what
i
think
it
will
take
to
get
you
to
comply,
that
order
is
narrowed
and
coercive
in
a
far
more
focused
sense
than
the
criminal
law
is
deterrent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
extra
element
starts,
first,
with
the
fact
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
injunction
already.
this
is
not
just
the
general
citizen
walking
the
street
who
has
the
criminal
law
applied
to
him.
it's
been
focused
on
a
particular
individual,
and
the
judge
has
indicated
to
that
individual
specific
sanctions
that
will
follow
further
violations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
distinction
is
the
same
one
that
the
court
has
drawn
between
civil
and
criminal
statutes.
your
argument,
it
seems,
would
undermine
the
validity
of
civil
penalties
generally,
but
this
court
has
upheld
them.
and
it's
upheld
them
because
it's
recognized
that
the
sanction
in
that
case,
in
a
civil
penalty
case,
serves
a
remedial
objective.
it's
reasonably
related
to
a
remedial
objective
and
it's
not
explainable
solely
on
the
basis
of
punitive
values.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
imprisonment
has
not
been
used
traditionally,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
the
imprisonment
may
well
not
be
valid.
and
the
distinction
is
this;
imprisonment
has
typically
been
used
in
contempt
where
a
situation
is...
the
coercive
situation
with
a
defendant
could
comply
at
any
point.
say
you're
in
prison
until
you
turn
over
the
documents.
now,
if
you
wait
3
days
to
turn
over
the
documents,
that's
like
the
situation
we
have
here.
the
union,
you're
going
to
be
fined
until
you
start
complying.
if
they
don't
comply
for
3
days,
they
incur
those
fines.
now,
the
prisoner
can't
get
back
those
3
days,
but
that
doesn't
make
the
proceeding
criminal.
here,
the
union
can't
get
back
the
fines
it
has
incurred
for
its
violations--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if...
adding
one
feature
that
i
think...
again,
that
is
present
in
this
case
and
confirms
the
remedial
aspect,
which
is
there
has
been
violations
of
a
prior
order.
in
other
words,
it's
not
simply
this
goes
with
the
injunction.
there's
a
problem
here
before
the
court
that
we
have
to
remedy.
the
injunction
isn't
working.
you're
violating
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
simply
to
vindicate
the
court's
authority,
but
to
remedy
the
problem
before
the
court.
the
sanctions
are
announced
in
order
to
coerce
the
defendant
into
complying
with
the
court
order.
it
is
that
remedial
aspect,
a
focused
aspect,
not
simply
the
general
deterrent
effect--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--two...
a
very
important
distinction,
your
honor.
that
is
talking
about
enforcing
the
civil
contempt
fines
once
they
have
been
imposed
and
reduced
to
judgment.
that
is
not
the
reason
the
judge
imposed
these
prospective
sanctions
in
the
first
place.
the
record
is
quite
clear.
the
judge
said
this
is
to
get
you
to
comply.
he
said
i
sincerely
hope
this
will
deter
future
violations.
the
passage
your
honor
was
reading
from
concerns
after
this
case,
the
union
and
the
company
had
settled.
at
that
point
does
the
court
have
to,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
vacate
the
previously
imposed
fines
already
reduced
to
judgment?
and
the
answer
is
no,
because
these
are
court
orders
and
those
are
not
at
the
disposal
of
the
parties.
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
it's...
the
trial
court
quite
clearly
spelled
out...
and
they're
set
forth
in
our
brief...
whenever
he
imposed
these
sanctions,
that
this
is
civil
contempt,
it
is
to
get
you
to
comply,
if
you
comply
you
will
not
incur
any
fines
whatever.
they
did
not
comply,
they
violated
the
order,
and
then
the
promised
sanction
was
imposed.
now
at
that
point
the
court's
authority
is
implicated.
is
its
fine
going
to
be
enforced
or
not,
or
is
it
going
to
be
something
that
the
union
and
the
company
can
bargain
about
between
themselves?
to
come
in
and
say,
when
the
judge
says
i
have
entered
sanctions
fining
you
this
much,
pay...
and
the
union
is
going
to
stand
up
and
say,
well,
no,
your
honor,
we've
sort
of
worked
that
out
between
ourselves.
at
that
point
the
court's
authority
to
enforce
its
previously
imposed
judgments
is
implicated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
doesn't
retroactively
change
the
character
of
the
sanctions
when
they
were
announced.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
the
united
mine
workers
decision
from
this
court...
this
court--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
disagree
with
you
that
the
classic
case
is
putting
someone
in
jail
until
they
comply
with
the
court's
order.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
use
of
fines
in
this
situation
is
invalid.
as
i
mentioned,
fines
were
used
this
way
in
the
united
mine
workers
case.
and
the
one
thing
this
court
has
said--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
certainly
a
significant
factor,
although
perhaps
the
judge
could
have
put
the
union
leaders
in
jail
until
the
union
complied
with
his
order.
and
he
didn't
do
so
for
a
simple
reason.
this
court
has
announced,
from
its
earlier
cases,
that
in
the
case
of
contempt,
a
court
should
use
the
least
possible
power
to
the
end
proposed.
the
judge,
confronted
with
a
situation
of
nothing
less
than
the
breakdown
of
the
rule
of
law
in
southwestern
virginia,
thought
that
this
was
the
least
incendiary
and
the
most
effective
way
to
bring
about
compliance
with
an
injunction.
putting
the
union
leaders
in
prison
may
have
been
more
dramatic,
but
may
have
contributed
to
the
problem
rather
than
remedying
it,
which
was
his
primary
objective
throughout.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
the
distinction
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
the
distinction
has
always
been
whether
it
was
something
easy
to
do
or
hard
to
do,
and
it's
certainly
not
that
difficult
to
tell.
the
one
thing
the
court
was
clear
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it
was
easy
to
determine
in
this
case,
because
the
one
thing
this
circuit
court
judge
and
his
counterpart
in
the
federal
court
who
was
addressing
the
same
situation,
both
concluded
is
that
the
union
leadership
had
complete
control
over
the
conduct
of
the
strikers.
there's
nothing
difficult
about
determining
whether
or
not
the
court's
order
had
been
complied
with.
certainly
nothing
difficult--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
question
is
not
violence--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
there--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
he
did.
there
was
discovery.
there
was
examination
and
cross-examination
of
witnesses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
know
that
the
old
common
law
had
a
situation
where
there
was
such
widespread
organized
flouting
of
a
court
injunction.
i'm
not
aware
of
that
situation
coming
up.
and
the
question
is
in
such
a
situation,
is
the
court
powerless
to
use
its
civil
contempt
powers
to
enforce
compliance
with
its
orders;
is
its
only
recourse
punishment
later
on?
take
the
situation
of
a
company
that's
dumping
dioxin
in
the
city
water
supply,
and
an
injunction
is
issued
and
the
company
is
still
doing
it.
the
union
would
say
that
all
that
the
court
can
do
is
somewhere
down
the
road
punish
the
company
for
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
there
were
four
specific
elements
in
the
injunction
that
were
affirmative
under
the
union's
viewing
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
not
from
what
my
brother
has
said
this
morning,
i
gather
they're
not,
no,
because
they
meet
his
affirmative
prohibitory
test.
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--let
me...
let
me
clarify
my
answer
to
your
earlier
question.
fines
were
imposed
for
violations
of
those
affirmative
obligations.
i
understood
my
brother
to
say
that
he
didn't
disagree
that
those
could
not...
i
mean,
could
be
imposed
during
civil
proceeding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
then
let
me
talk
about
part
two.
his
argument
on
part
two
is
that
the
parties
can
agree
between
themselves
to
settle
the
case,
and
that
that
precludes
the
court
from
imposing
the
fines
that
had
already
been
reduced
to
judgment.
that
is
a
question
of
state
law,
how
the
mootness
rules
apply.
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
provided
the
definitive
answer
to
that
question
of
state
law.
gompers
doesn't
control,
not
only
for
the
reason
that
it's
an
issue
of
state
law,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
gompers
court,
in
considering
the
same
question
in
the
federal
context,
analyzed
it
in
mootness
terms.
we
have
a
situation
where
a
case
has
been
settled
and
the
question
is
the
consequence
of
that
on
particular
judgments.
it
seems
to
me
a
classic
case
of
mootness.
justice
stevens,
i
think
i
did
not
answer
your
question.
the
affirmative
provisions
in
the
order
were
violated
and
fines
were
imposed
for
those.
my
point
is
that
it
is
a
difficult,
if
not
impossible
task
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
affirmative
and
the
prohibitory.
take
the
recent
situation
out
in
los
angeles,
the
police
sickout.
an
injunction
was
entered
there
to
end
that.
it
could
have
said
return
to
work
or
it
could
have
said
stop
the
sickout:
affirmative
or
prohibitory.
and
you
can't
look
to
the
status
quo
to
figure
out
in
substance
which
it
was,
because
some
of
the
officers
would
be
sick
one
day
and
some
the
next.
the
distinction
is
completely
manipulable
and
is
not
the
test
that
this
court
has
adopted.
finally,
i
would
note
briefly
that
in
their
papers
the
union
argues
for
a
remand
to
reconsider
the
excessiveness
of
the
fines,
although
it
has
not
been
mentioned
this
morning.
they
have
two
arguments:
substantive
due
process
and
the
eighth
amendment.
the
eighth
amendment
argument
was
waived;
it
wasn't
decided
by
the
virginia
supreme
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
has
not.
it
would--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
question
was
specifically
left
open
in
browning
ferris.
it
would
seem
odd
to
have
to
address
that
profound
constitutional
question
in
a
case
where
the
issue
was
not
raised.
they
did
not,
if
i
may,
raise
the
question
in
their
application.
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
a
questions
presented
practice
similar
to
that
of
this
court.
the
eighth
amendment
or
the
words
excessive
fines
clause
do
not
appear
in
their
questions
presented.
thank
you,
your
honor.
