justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
judge
says,
go
back
to
work
instead
of,
stop
striking?
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
it
seems
to
me
one's
prohibitory,
the
other's...
the
other's
mandatory.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that?
i
don't
know...
i
mean
what
the
judge
wants
is
to
get
these
people
back
to
work.
that's
what
the...
that's
what
the
plaintiff
wants.
he
can
put
it
either
way:
stop
striking
or
go
back
to
work.
and
according
to
your
analysis,
one
can
be
enforced
civilly,
the
other
one
can't.
that
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
ex
ante
or
ex
post?
i
mean,
ex
ante
when
the
fines
are
announced,
if
you
do
this
thing
you
will
pay
a
fine,
they
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
plaintiff,
to
protect
the
plaintiff
from
the
harm
that
doing
that
unlawful
thing
would
produce.
but
once
the
acts
are
done,
the
plaintiffs
have
already
been...
and
then
the
fine
is
imposed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
at
that
point
there's
nothing
left
but
vindication
of
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
second
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
your
position
that
despite
all
of
the
characteristics
which
exist
that
you
say
would
make
this
a
criminal
proceeding,
it
can
be
converted
into
a
civil
proceeding
so
long
as
the
state
court
announces
when
it's
imposes,
of
course,
you
know,
even
if
you
violate
these
orders
and
incur
liability
for
the
fines,
you'll
be
able
to
settle?
if
you
settle
and
the
plaintiff
is
willing
to
waive
the
fines,
the
fines
will
be
waived,
is
that
enough
to
convert
what
might
otherwise
be
a
criminal
process,
according
to
your
analysis,
into
a
civil?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
vice
versa.
i
asked
you
the
vice
versa
question.
likewise,
if
the
plaintiff
can
waive
it,
it
becomes
civil.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
if
you
say
a,
you
have
to
say
b,
mr.
gold,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
has
it
become...
why
has
it
become
coercive
just
because
you
name
the
amount
of
money?
i
mean
is
the
difference
between
the
judge
saying
if
you
violate
my
order,
i'm
going
to
fine
you
$1,000
a
day,
and
the
judge
saying
if
you
violate
my
order,
i'm
going
to
fine
you
something;
i
won't
tell
you
now
what
it
is,
but
you're
going
to
be
fined
for
contempt
of
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
they're
both
coercive,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
roberts,
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
stevens
a
little
earlier
about
an
order
that
imposes
imprisonment
instead
of
fines
prospectively,
it
seems
to
me
to
stand
history
on
its
head.
the
classic...
the
classic
contempt
situation,
civil
contempt,
is
putting
somebody
in
jail.
in
fact,
i
don't
know
any
of
the
older
cases
in
which
civil
contempt,
coercing
somebody
to
turn
over
the
key,
is
a
fine.
it's
always
jail
and
no
fines.
do
you
know
any
early
cases
that
imposed
fines?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
said
very
early.
i'm
talking--
[laughter]
i'm
talking
about
the
development
of
civil
contempt
in
the
common
law,
and
the
classic
situation
is
throwing
somebody
in
jail
until
he
coughs
up
the
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
you
told
justice
stevens,
well,
if
prospectively
you
put
him
in
jail
it's
obviously
bad,
although
prospectively
you
can
fine
him
and
that's
just
civil.
but
i
think
that...
that
just
inverts
what
had
been
the
rule
at
common
law,
that
you
could
throw
somebody
in
jail.
i
don't
know
any
rule
at
common
law
that
you
could
fine
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
early...
the
early
cases
in
the
development
of
this
civil
contempt
at
common
law
in
which
what
the
person
in
jail
was
required
to
do
before
he
could
get
out
was
something
very...
maybe
there's
no
way
it
could
have
been
something
very
complex.
it
had
to
be
something
pretty
simple,
didn't
it?
he
had
to
turn
over
a
document
or
sign
a
document
or
do
something
like
that.
it's
very
easy;
you
don't
really
need
a
jury
to
figure
out
whether
that's
been
done
or
not.
and
might
not
that
be
the
distinction?
might
not
that
be
why
that
was
allowed?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
was
simple
to
tell,
whereas
where
the...
whether
this
has
been
violated
or
not
is
very
difficult
to
tell.
i
want
a
jury
trial
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
easy
to
determine,
not
necessarily
easy
to
do.
easy
to
determine
whether
it's
been
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
there
had
been
any
violence?
whether,
you
know...
you
mean
people
don't
come
in
and
say
there
was
violence
and
other
people
say
there
wasn't
violence?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
old
common
law,
the
classic
case,
the
judge
says
here's
the
document,
your
honor,
let
me
out
of
jail.
he
says,
oh,
yeah,
i
looked
at
the
document.
yes,
you
gave
it
to
me.
out
of
jail.
in
this
case
there's
going
to
be
debate
about
whether
there
was
violence,
continued
violence
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
judge
going
to
do?
he's
going
to
hear
witnesses,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
didn't
have
to
be
done
in
the
old
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
threw
somebody
in
jail
until
he
coughed
up
the
key
or
signed
a
document
or
delivered
a
document.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
was
going
to
ask
that.
i
think
he
does...
he
was
just...
he
was
just
talking
about
part
one
of
his
case.
i
think
he
thinks
part
two
of
his
case
washes
those
out
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
those
were
settled
out
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bender,
there...
there
are
scholars
who
think
that
that
was
a
great
mistake,
our
line
of
decisions
which
allowed
administrative
agencies,
at
the
direction
of
congress
or
not,
to
avoid
the
right
to
jury
trial
by
imposing
civil
crime...
so-called
civil
penalties.
and
i
don't
know
that
we
want
to
extend
that
to
a
creation
by
a
district
judge.
it's
serious
enough
to
allow
its
creation
by
a
legislature.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
our
model
of
constitutionality
is
going
to
be
civil
fines
by
administrative
agencies.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
labor
board
doesn't
have
to
announce
in
advance
what
the
fines
will
be,
which
is,
assertedly,
what
distinguishes
this
and
makes
it
civil
contempt,
right?
the
labor
board
can
just
say
you
don't
do
this,
and
if
you
do
it
i
will
impose
a
civil
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
we're
going
to
extend
to
district
judges,
i
assume.
