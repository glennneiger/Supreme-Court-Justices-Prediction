m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
gold,
is
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
mandatory
prohibitory
distinction
upon
which
you
seem
to
think
the
whole
case
turns
has
any
underlying
connection
with
the
constitutional
values
that
are
at
stake
here.
i
should
have
thought
you
could
have
devised
some
other
tests
for
us,
such
as
whether
or
not
the
sanction
is
prospective
or
retroactive,
backward
looking,
forward
looking,
ad
hoc,
something
like
that.
but
the
mandatory-prohibitory
distinction,
it
seems
to
me,
is
rooted,
to
be
sure,
in
what
we
have
said
in
the
cases,
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
resonate
in
any
of
the
underlying
constitutional
values
that
are
at
stake
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the
constitutional
values
that
are
served
by
that
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
a
domestic
relations
case,
a
judge
can
say
that
for
every
time
you
go
near
the
wife's
house
in
violation
of
this
order,
i'll
fine
you
$500.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's...
is
the
basis
for
that
distinction
just
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court
as
opposed
to
bringing
the
dispute
to
an
orderly
focus
before
the
court?
i
can
see
if
documents
aren't
being
produced
or
if
the
court's
processes
are
somehow
being
thwarted
so
that
it
cannot
resolve
the
dispute,
that
it
may
have
to
take
these
measures,
but
this
seems
to
me
an
ultimate
order
designed
only
to
vindicate
the
court's
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
reason
for
that
the
necessity
of
coercing
corporate
defendants
as
opposed
to
individuals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
definition
of
criminal
contempt
is
an
act
that's
malum
in
se?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
definition
of
criminal
contempt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we'll
take
it
either
way.
