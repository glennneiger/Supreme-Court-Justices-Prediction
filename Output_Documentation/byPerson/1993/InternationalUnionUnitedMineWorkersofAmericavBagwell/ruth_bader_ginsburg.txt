justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gold,
in
that
respect,
are
you
saying...
are
you
saying
that
a
stop
order
can
never
be
enforced
except
through
a
criminal
contempt
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
were
examples
given
by
your
opponent
for...
in
the
brief.
the
patco
case
was
one,
the
operation
rescue
injunctions
were
others.
can
you
say
under
what
circumstances
a
stop
order
can
be
enforced
without
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding?
what
is
the
dividing
line
between
when
a
stop
order
can
be
enforced
and
when
it
requires
a
separate
criminal
contempt
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gold,
are
you--
--was
patco
such
a
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
that
a
fine
per
day?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gold,
does
your...
does
your
case
rest
on
this?
justice
kennedy
prefaced
his
comment
with
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
suppose...
suppose
we
reject
this
distinction
between
not
doing
and
doing.
what
are
you
left
with?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
court
is
unwilling
to
draw
a
line
between
acting
and
not
acting,
what
is
the
remainder
of
your
argument
on
why
these
particular
fines
should
be
classed
criminal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
if
the
fines
hadn't
been
prospective,
then
the
enforcement
of
the
injunction
would
have
had
to
have
been
through
a
criminal
process
with
a
jury
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
everything
turned
on
specifying
the
fee
schedule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
why
don't
we
take
the
court
at
its
word?
and
it
said:
"courts
of
the
commonwealth
must
have
the
authority
to
enforce
their
orders
by
employing
coercive
civil
sanctions
if
the
dignity
of
the
law
and
public
respect
for
the
judiciary
are
to
be
maintained.
"
the
court
is
there
telling
us
its
concern
with
its
own
good
and
welfare,
and
it
must
enforce...
impose
these
fines
to
promote
public
respect
for
the
judiciary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't
that
show,
if
there
was
ambiguity
before,
what
the
court
conceived
the
character
of
these
fines
to
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
i'm
not
vacating...
the
court
says
we're
not
vacating
these
fines
because
they
relate
to
the
dignity
of
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
why
would
somebody
regard
that
as
going
to
mootness
instead
of
revealing
what
the
character
of
these
proceedings
were?
in
other
words,
if
it's
on
the
criminal
side,
then
it's
certainly
not
moot
just
because
the
parties
settled.
so
why
isn't
the
mootness
for
this
really
a
misnomer?
if
the
case
is
still
alive,
it's
because
it
has
a
criminal
character.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
it
just
a
matter
of
how
the
judge
characterizes
it?
isn't
there
something
that
we
can...
you
can
describe
and
say
if
you
have
that,
it's
got
to
be
criminal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
describing
what
falls
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
when--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
what
do
you
with
the
old
distinction
between
a
judge
can
act
on
the
spot
if
a
contempt
is
committed
in
the
judge's
presence,
but
if
it's
not
in
the
judge's
presence,
then
it
has
to
be
enforced
through
a
criminal
procedure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
wipe
that
out
and
say
if
the
judge
calls
it
civil,
it's
civil?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bender,
suppose
the
state
didn't
have
the
civil
party
in
this
case.
suppose
the
mine
owners
hadn't
sued
for
an
injunction,
but
there's
all
this
violence
that's
very
dangerous
for
the
community
going
on,
and
so
the
state
of
virginia
wants
to
stop
it;
what
kind
of
proceeding
would
you
have
to
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
since
he
didn't
have
a
statutory
regime
like
that,
the
characterization
of
this
case
as
civil,
then,
depends
on
the
existence
of
a
civil
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
that's
so,
then
when
the
civil
party
departs
and
says
i'm
through,
then
how
can
the
state
continue
to
maintain
that
it's
civil?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
real
party
in
interest
or
the...
the
state
isn't
named
as
a
party.
