mr.
roberts,
can
i
ask
just
one
other
question.
what
if,
in
addition
to
saying
if
you
do
so
and
so
you'll
be
fined
$100,000,
the
judge
said,
and
you'll
spend
24
hours
in
jail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
what
would
your
answer
be
if
the
judge
did
say
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
roberts,
that's
not
quite
right.
at
page
27
of
your
brief
you
point
out
some
specific
commands
that
the
judge
gave:
"place
a
designated
supervisor
or
captain
at
each
picket
site.
"
and
such.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
that
sort
of
thing,
you
could
tell
whether
the
man
was
there
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that...
those
penalties
for
that
sort
of
thing
are
not
at
issue
here,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
it,
the
penalties
are
for
things
like
somebody
threw
a
rock,
and
the
union
says
it
was
a
stranger
or
he
didn't
have
authority
to
do
it
or
he
was
violating
orders
or
something
like
that
which,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
requires
some
kind
of
a
evidentiary
hearing,
discovery,
to
find
out
whether
it
happened.
but
whether
they
posted
a
supervisor
at
the
corner
of
state
and
madison,
that's
not
a
factual
problem.
