justice
john
paul
stevens
teague
said
that,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
i
mean,
in
teague
itself
they
didn't
reach
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position,
supposing
all
those
things
were
true,
supposing
you
decided
in
missouri
to
have
the
multiple
offender
statute...
i
forget
the
name
of
it...
apply
only
after
a
jury
found
all
the
facts
that
the
judge
now
finds,
prior
convictions
and...
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
standard
of
proof
in
this
proceeding
before
us
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
does
apply.
then
what's
the
third
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that's
different
from
a
limited
choice...
say
that...
say
the
multiple
offender
had
to
have
a
mandatory
sentence
longer,
say
it
was
a
little
more
severe
than
it
is
here,
would
that
be
a
distinguishing
feature
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
main
point
that
this...
that
here
the
judge
does
the
sentencing,
and
in
bullington
it
was
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
as
soon
as
you...
as
soon
as
you've
acknowledged
that,
then
the
absence
of
instructions
to
the
jury,
of
course,
is
just
because
it's
a
judge,
not
a
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
requires
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it's
not
a
trial-like
setting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
your
view...
supposing
a
state
that
did
not
have
capital
punishment
and
instead
had
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole
as
a
very...
for
very,
very
serious
crimes,
decided
to
impose
a
sentencing
procedure
that's
analogous
to
those
that
are
used
in
the
death
penalty
states,
to
be...
because
it's
such
a
serious
crime,
and
they
had
all
the
trial-like
procedures
there;
do
you
think
bullington
would
apply
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
it's
a
hard
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
all...
see,
my
hypothesis,
all
of
them
are
present
except
it's
a
different
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
not...
you
don't
rest...
neither
of
your
grounds,
then,
rests
on
the
fact
that
death
is
different
from
a
noncapital
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
interesting.
if
i
remember
correctly,
you
don't
even
mention
teague
in
your
brief,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
like
us
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
case
because
you
think
maybe
you
can
win
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
your
statute?
i
notice
the
procedure
applies
to
a
prior
offender,
persistent
offender,
or
dangerous
offender.
what...
does
the
statute
define
the
term
dangerous
offender?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it...
is
it
defined
in
terms
of
prior
convictions,
or
just
general
behavior?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there...
is
it
conceivable
that
there
will
be
issues
of
fact
in
a...
say
the
charge
was
dangerous
offender
rather
than
persistent
offender,
that
might
involve
more
conflicts
in
evidence
than
just
whether
or
not
there
was
a
certified
copy
of
a
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
missouri
procedure?
supposing
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
to
the
crime,
the
underlying
crime,
does
the...
but
then
he
disputes
the
persistent
or
dangerous
offender
status,
would
there
then
be
a
separate
hearing
on
those
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
suppose
it
could
happen,
if,
say,
the
indictment
had
failed
to
allege
the
prior
fact,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that'd
be
the
end
of
the
game
right
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
not
too
unusual,
is
it,
to
have
a
guilty
plea
on
the
merits
and
then
have
a
hearing
on
sentencing,
on
mitigation
and
aggravation,
even
in
a
noncapital
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
the
judge
isn't
always
bound
by
the
negotiations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that's
not
true
of
the
dangerous
offender.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
goes
to
the
character.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
start,
can
i
just
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
questions
presented
do
not
mention
the
teague
issue.
is
that
right...
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
mention
teague.
and
you
just...
at
the
end
of
the
brief
you
did.
i
thought
it
was
sort
of
like
our
izumi
case,
that
it
was
discussed
in
the
briefs
but
not
in
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
first
question
doesn't
say
anything
about
extending.
it
just
says
should
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that,
you
think,
implicitly
raises
a
teague
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
there
were
a
dangerous
offender
and
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
particular
crime
had
all
the
aggravating
circumstances
attached
to
it
that
the
state
relied
on?
could
you
have
a
second
trial
on
that
kind
of
issue
in
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
statute
does
cover
that
very
situation,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand,
but
your
argument
applies
to
it.
