mr.
frank
a.
jung
jung,
your...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
before
this
court
involves
whether
the
double
jeopardy
principles
of
bullington
should
be
extended
to
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings,
whether
doing
so
would
be
teague-barred,
and,
indeed,
whether
bullington
should
be
overturned.
the
purpose
of
sentencing
is
to
assure
that
the
punishment
fits
the
offender,
and
not
merely
the
offense.
defendant's
status,
and
not
his
conduct,
is
the
linchpin
of
sentencing.
the
rehabilitation
of
a
defendant
is
a
factor
that
the
sentencer
should
consider.
because
sentencing
focuses
on
the
proper
punishment,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
never
prevented
a
sentencer
from
imposing
a
higher
sentence
upon
resentencing.
in
fact,
in
united
states
v.
difrancesco,
this
court
stated
that
the
task
is
to
determine
whether
the
criminal
sentence,
once
pronounced,
is
to
be
accorded
constitutional
finality
and
conclusiveness
similar
to
that
which
attaches
to
a
jury's
verdict
of
acquittal.
this
court
stated:
"we
conclude
that
neither
the
history
of
sentencing
practices,
nor
the
pertinent
rulings
of
the
court,
not
even
consideration
of
double
jeopardy
policy,
supports
an
equation.
"
the
procedures
required
for
sentencing
a
defendant
as
a
persistent
offender
in
missouri
include
pleading
the
prior
convictions
in
the
indictment,
or
information,
introduction
of
evidence
of
the
defendant's
prior
convictions
at
a
hearing
conducted
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
prior
to
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury,
and
a
finding
by
the
judge
that
the
defendant
is
a
persistent
offender.
the
statute
allows
for
the
use
of
presentence
investigation
reports
and
commitments
as
proof
of
a
prior
conviction.
case
law
in
missouri
has
established
that
introduction...
introducing
certified
copies
of
prior
convictions
and
commitment
reports
is
prima
facie
proof
that
the
defendant
is
the
person
named
in
the
prior
convictions
for
the
purpose
of
the
habitual
offender
statute.
once
a
prima
facie
proof
is
made,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant
to
disprove
the
prior
convictions.
if
the
defendant
fails
to
rebut
the
prima
facie
proof,
the
trial
court
may
rely
on
that
prior...
those
prior
convictions
for
invoking
the
habitual
offender
statute.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
would
be.
but
if
it...
in...
not
in
all
cases.
in...
if
a
individual
was
convicted
of
a
class
b
felony,
the
range
of
punishment
then
would
enhance,
as
an
habitual
offender,
to
a
class
a
felony,
the
rule
within--
mr.
frank
a.
jung
--yes.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
also
would
affect
his
eligibility
for
parole
under
the
guide...
missouri
statutes.
as
a
persistent
offender,
there
are
consequences
of
when
you
would
be
eligible
for
parole
consideration
also.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
it
is
not
a
mandatory
such
as
a
mandatory
life
imprisonment
if
you're
an
habitual
offender.
it
would
just...
since
he
was
already
a
class
a
felony,
and
one
of
the
sentences
within
the
class
a
felony
is
life
imprisonment,
it
was
still
within
that
range,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
i...
my
investigation
of
that,
your
honor,
is...
basically
found
that
states
are
split
on
that
issue.
some
states
have
that
an
habitual
offender
is
subject
to
a
mandatory
life
imprisonment.
certain
states,
such
as
illinois,
have...
where
they
are
is
within
a
range
of
punishment
that
is
imposed
by
the
judge,
an
enhanced
range
of
punishment.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that's...
your
honor.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
have
raised
that
this
issue
is
teague-barred.
the
court
below
found
that
it
was
not
teague-barred,
because
they
said
you
could
stretch
bullington
into
the
application
of
non...
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings.
and
our
position
is
that
stretching
bullington
alone
would
be
teague-barred,
because
it
is
not
dictated
by
past
precedents
of
this
case...
this
court.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
i
think,
your
honor,
the
court
could
state
that
double
jeopardy
doesn't
apply
to
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings
in
and
or
itself,
and
not
have
to
reach
whether
it
is
a
new
rule.
if
this
court
were
to
apply
that...
that
bullington
doesn't
apply
to
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings,
we
wouldn't
have
the
issue
of
whether
it's
teague-barred.
if
it's...
if
this
court
were
to
interpret
that
bullington
does
apply
to
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings,
then
we
would
argue
that
it
is
teague-barred
because
it
would
be
an
application
of
a
new
rule
on
a
collateral
appeal.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
even
though
i...
there
are
cases
that
say
teague
is
a
threshold
issue,
so
it
seems
like
it
could
be,
in
some
certain
situations.
some
cases
have
said
that
teague
is
a
threshold
issue,
saying
that
we
have
to
look
for--
mr.
frank
a.
jung
--i
believe
your...
in
saffle
v.
parks,
i
believe,
also
stated
that
also,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that's
correct,
your
honor.
so
it
would
be...
we...
i
would
concede
that
if
you
determine
that
this
could
be
teague-barred,
and
not
rule
on
the
merits.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
in
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings,
that
there
is
a
more
greater
emphasis
to
allow
the
jury
to
make
that
finding
within
the
broader
range
of
punishment,
and
they
have
a
more
expanded
range
of
punishment
which
they
can
impose,
unlike
situations
where
it's
either
life
or
death
in
capital
situations,
your
honor.
also
under
the
missouri
statute,
your
honors,
the
trial
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
testimony
regarding
the
defendant's
habitual
offenses.
so,
needless
to
say,
that
in
missouri
the
court
could
just
not
have
to
have
a
prior
offender
hearing
separate
and
distinct.
he
could
recognize
the
testimony
at
trial
and
hold,
in
and
off
itself,
based
on
that
testimony,
that
the
defendant
is
an
habitual
offender.
the
fact
that
the
presentence
investigation
and
commitment
reports
can
be
admitted
into
evidence,
along
with
the
fact
that
a
certified
copy
of
the
judgement
and
sentence
establishes
a
prima
facie
evidence
of
prior
conviction,
demonstrates
that
habitual
offender
statute
is
a
ministerial
act.
because
missouri's
habitual
offender
statute
is
a
ministerial
act,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
apply.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that's
correct.
if
the
defendant
were
to
challenge
it,
this
burden
would
shift
back
to
the
defendant
to
prove
that
it
was
uncounseled.
he
could
not
challenge
the
conviction,
in
and
of
itself,
but
he
could
challenge
a
constitutionality,
such
as
it
was
an
uncounseled
guilty
plea.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
no,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
the
only
thing
that
is
in
the
record,
your
honor,
is
at
the
trial...
the
prosecutor
on
the
morning
of
trial,
at
a
pretrial
conference,
stated
that
he
was
willing
to
proceed.
he
had
the
prior
convictions
and
was
ready
to
proceed
and
demonstrate
the
prior
offender,
the
statute.
but
why
it
never
occurred,
we
don't
know,
your
honor.
one
of
the
purposes
of
double
jeopardy
is
to
prevent
a
defendant
from
being
retried
and
convicted,
although
innocent.
however,
the
possibility
of
innocence
of
a
sentence
cannot
occur,
because
a
sentence...
second
sentencing
decision
is
as
correct
as
a
first
jury
sentencing
decision.
even
if
the
trial
court
determines
that
the
prosecutor
failed
to
meet
the
statutory
obligation
for
establishing
defendant
to
be
an
habitual
offender,
the
prosecutor
failure
is
not
an
implied
acquittal
of
the
prior
convictions.
nothing
would
prohibit
the
use
of
those
prior
convictions
in
a
subsequent
proceeding.
prior
to
bullington,
the
protections
afforded
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
had
never
been
extended
to
sentencing.
and
since
bullington,
this
court
has
never
extended
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings.
in
declining
to
extend
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings,
this
court
noted
that
the
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings
allowed
for
a
broader
range
of
punishment,
rather
than
the
life
and
death
limitation
imposed
by
a
jury
in
capital
sentencing
proceedings.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that
was
in
united
states
v.
difrancesco.
the
court
noted
that
the
broader
range
of
punishment,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
the
judge
had
to
impose
once
he
made
the
finding
that
the
defendant
was
a
dangerous
special
offender
in
that...
in
that
case.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
lockhart
v.
nelson,
this
court
specifically
stated
that
the
issue
was
not
before
it
at
that
time,
and
stated
that
the
court...
because
all
the
parties
assumed
that
it
did
apply,
but
they
didn't
address
that
issue
and
specifically
left
it
open.
in
extending
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
capital
sentencing
proceedings,
this
court
determined
that
the
capital
sentencing
proceedings
are
unique
because
they
so
resemble
a
trial,
the
so-called
uniqueness
found
by
this
court
in
bullington,
including
opening
statements,
testimony,
introduction
of
evidence,
jury
instructions,
final
arguments,
and
jury
deliberations.
these
facts,
coupled
with
the
prosecutor's
requirement
to
prove
certain
statutorily
defined
facts
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
jury's
limitation
of
imposing
either
life
or
death,
led
this
court
to
believe
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applied
to
capital
sentencing
proceedings.
unlike
capital
sentencing
proceedings,
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings
do
not
require
the
same...
do
not
require
the
same
unique
characteristics.
although
a
separate
proceeding
is
required
to
establish
whether
defendant
is
an
habitual
offender
under
missouri
statutes,
this
proceeding
is
conducted
before
a
judge
and
not
a
jury,
and
is
conducted
prior
to
the
jury's
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
to
determine
if
the
judge
or
jury
will
determine
the
defendant's
sentence.
there
are
no
opening
statements,
closing
arguments,
nor
is
there
any
instructions
or
jury
deliberation.
the
only
common
characteristics
between
capital
sentencing
proceedings
and
non--
mr.
frank
a.
jung
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
looked
at
the
bullington
decision,
there
were
three
basic
factors
that
led
this
court
to
that
decision,
and
one
was
a
trial...
only
one
of
them
was
a
trial-like
proceeding.
the
second
one
was
the
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
third
one
was
the
choice
between
life
and
death.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
the
limited
choice
between
life
and
death.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
i
think
that
could
be
considered,
your
honor,
if
you
looked
at
it
and
you
saw
all
three
factors.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
then
you
could
probably
say
it
looked
more
like
bullington.
however,
i
think
that,
in
this
situation,
your
honor,
it
does
not
look
like
bullington
because
we
don't
have
the...
such
as
in
the
texas
habitual
offender
statute,
which
requires
a
mandatory
life
imprisonment,
if
the
finding
of
the
habitual
offender
statutes.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
i...
case
law,
your
honor,
i
believe
states
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
judge
sentencing
and
jury
sentencing,
so
that
wouldn't
be
that
relevant,
whether
the
judge
or
jury
did
the
sentencing.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
there
is
no...
the
issue
is,
basically,
whether
this
is
a
trial-like
setting.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
is
this
an
adversarial
proceeding.
and,
we
argue
that
it's
not
an
adversarial--
mr.
frank
a.
jung
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is...
just
not
that
factor,
in
and
of
itself,
makes
it
a
trial-like
setting.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
i
believe
it's
encompassed...
fairly
encompassed
in
the
first
question,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
jung
no,
your
honor.
well,
your
honor,
in
the
izumi
case
this
court
stated
that
the
teague
was
fairly
included
in
the
first
question,
and
we
feel
that
if
we're
asking
should
it
be
extended,
that
fairly
encompasses
if
it
is
extended--
mr.
frank
a.
jung
--well,
should
apply.
well--
mr.
frank
a.
jung
--we
believe
so,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
this...
the
court
also
noted
that
if
it
raises...
decides
an
important
question,
even
if
it's
not
raised
in
the
question
presented,
you
can
still
decide
it.
so
you
can
still
decide
it,
since
it
does
raise
an
important
question.
plus
since
it
was
not
objected
to--
mr.
frank
a.
jung
--pardon
me,
your
honor,
that
it
wasn't
an
important
question
or
it
wasn't--
mr.
frank
a.
jung
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
it
was
also
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
brief
in
izumi.
and
the
court
noted
that
even
if
we
decided
the
question,
it
wouldn't
be
an
important
question.
it
would
only
address
this
case
and
it
wouldn't
help
the
general
interest
because
they
would
have
to
decide
whether
the...
they
had
standing,
rather
than
whether
the
dismissal...
the
summary
judgment
dismissal,
i
believe
it
was,
would--
mr.
frank
a.
jung
--correct,
your
honor.
they
said
to
decide
that
wouldn't
be
that
important
of
a
question.
plus
also
in
izumi,
we
think,
is
distinguished
because
in
izumi
it
was
objected
to.
in
the
respondent's
brief
there
was
no
objected.
we
would
assert
there'd
be
a
waiver
in
that
situation,
to
the
issue.
the
issue
that
i'd
like
to
raise
here
on
rebuttal,
your
honors,
are
that
respondent
seems
to
assert
that
we're
not
looking
at
the
double
jeopardy
applying
to
sentencing,
we're
determining
to
the
status.
clearly,
if
they're
asking
it
to
apply
to
a
status,
it
would
be
a
new
rule
implication,
because
this
court
has
never
decided
that
it
applies
to
the
status
of
an
habitual
offender.
the
status
is
no
different
from
the
factual
question
of
sentencing,
but
it
is
a
distinction
that
a
court
has
made.
the
issue
of
whether
double
jeopardy
applies
to
noncapital
cases
is
subject
to
debate,
as
justice
o'connor
has
noted.
in
a
recent
case
in
which...
we
informed
respondent's
counsel,
and
was
decided
only
a
month
ago
in
illinois.
in
people
v.
levin,
the
illinois
supreme
court
declined
to
apply
the
bullington
to
a
not...
their
habitual
offender
statute.
and
it
shows
that
reasonable
jurors
can
disagree.
in
fact,
in
the
lee
case,
the
lee
case
did
discuss
the
bullington
and
distinguished...
it
said
this
is
not
bullington.
we
think
that's
a
good-faith
analysis
of
the
existing
precedent
at
that
time.
as
to
the
exceptions,
surely
respondent
is
not
stating
that
an
habitual
offender
is
a
protected
class
which
should
be
implied
under
the
first
exception
under
teague.
are
we
encouraging
habitual
offenders,
to
state
that
you
are
a
protected
class
of
individuals
that
obtain
a
right,
that
will
not
be
punished
because
of
the
new...
because
of
an
enactment
of
a
new
rule?
i
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honors.
lastly,
as
i
think
the
court
noted,
was
there
is
a
distinction
regarding
the
accuracy.
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
this
gives
a
more
accurate
consideration
for
the
jury
or
for
a
sentencer
to
impose,
knowing
the
background
of
a
defendant.
whether
it
be
a
judge
or
jury,
they
should
have
all
rights
of
the
facts...
history
of
the
defendant.
even
in
capital
cases,
this
court
has
decided
that
juries
should
have
the
broadest
spectrum
of
information
of
a
defendant's
background
before
deciding
his
fate.
that
would
make
it
more
accurate,
the
same
way
as
this...
this
situation.
mr.

jung
i
think
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
it
would
be
different.
i--
mr.
frank
a.

--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
that
statute...
that
section
of

journal.
mr.
frank

thank
you,
your
honors.
