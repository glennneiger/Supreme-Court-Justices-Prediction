chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-1500,
paul
caspari
v.
christopher
bohlen.
mr.
jung.
is
that
how
you
pronounce
it,
jung
rather
than
jung?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
jung,
mr.
jung.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
indication--
--well,
it
might
not
be
a
ministerial
act
if
the
defendant
wanted
to
challenge
some
prior
conviction
on
the
ground
that
he
had
not
been
afforded
counsel,
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
case
was
that,
mr.
jung?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that...
that
was
decided
before
bullington,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
really
can't
say
that
that
case
decided
that
bullington
didn't
extend
to
noncapital
cases,
if
it
came
before
bullington.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
kelley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
and
then
we'll
hear
from
you
next,
mr.
sindel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kelley.
and,
mr.
sindel,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
referring
to
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
or
the
eighth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
sort
of
evidence
would
you
present
if
you...
the
issue
is
persistent
offender,
habitual
offender,
and
the
state
comes
in
with
certified
copies?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
time
around,
did
you
present
any
evidence
challenging
the
prior
convictions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
did
the
respondent's
attorney?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unsuccessful,
i
gather.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
long
before
teague,
though,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
that
it
doesn't
come
under
that
justification
for
accepting
teague?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it
wasn't
in
the
name
of
accuracy
that
they
did
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
either
robinson
or
ashe
against
swenson,
i
don't
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
to
say
you
basically
had
your
shot
is
counter
to
accuracy,
it
seems
to
me.
if
you
say,
well,
the
second
time
around
we've
got
more
evidence
and,
you
know,
both
sides
can
marshal
their
resources
better,
that's
a
good
argument
for
accuracy.
but
the
argument
of
double
jeopardy
is
you
shouldn't
have
a
second
chance,
but
that's
not
an
accuracy
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sindel.
mr.
jung,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jung.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
