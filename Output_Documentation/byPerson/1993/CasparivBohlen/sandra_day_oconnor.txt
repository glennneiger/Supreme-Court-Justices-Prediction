justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
was
it
rum...
arizona
against
rumsey
where
we
had
a
life
or
death
determination
determined
by
the
judge,
not
the
jury,
and
we
said
bullington
applied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
bullington
should
just
be
limited
to
capital
sentencing
proceedings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
you
take
no
position
on
whether
this
is
teague-barred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
federal
interest
might
also
turn
on
a
teague
determination
in
some
cases,
i
would
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sindel,
i
guess
there
are
decisions
of
various
courts
going
both
ways
on
whether
bullington
extends
to
this
kind
of
a
noncapital
setting.
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
were
out
there
before
this
decision
was
handed
down?
some
of
them,
certainly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
state
courts
in
missouri
had,
in
the
lee
case,
said
that
this
persistent
offender
proceeding
is
different
from
the
capital
sentencing
proceeding
within
bullington.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
i
guess,
it
did
say
that
the
persistent
offender
scheme
bears
no
similarity
to
the
capital
sentencing
scheme
in
bullington.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
least
that's
what
they
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
now,
do
you
think
that
under
all
these
circumstances
we
have
a
teague-bar
problem
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
a
new
rule
that's
been
adopted
here
under
our
precedents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
court
has
at
least
reserved
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
bullington
in
proceedings--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--like
this,
and
there
are
lower-court
decisions
going
the
other
way.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
real
problem
under
teague.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
part
of
what
izumi
was
all
about,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
circumstances
under
which
we
will
address
things
that
aren't
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
of
the
cases
is
caspari
against
bohlen
which
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
respondent,
christopher
bohlen,
was
convicted
in
missouri
state
court
on
three
counts
of
first
degree
robbery.
he
was
sentenced
as
a
persistent
offender
to
three
consecutive
15-year
prison
terms.
under
missouri
law,
a
persistent
offender
is
someone
the
trial
judge
finds
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
who
have
been
convicted
of
two
or
more
prior
felonies.
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
but
reversed
the
sentence
because
no
proof
had
been
made
of
the
prior
convictions.
on
remand,
the
state
introduced
evidence
of
four
prior
felony
convictions,
rejecting
the
respondent's
contention
that
allowing
the
state
another
opportunity
to
prove
his
prior
convictions
violated
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
trial
judge
found
the
respondent
to
be
a
persistent
offender
and
again,
sentenced
him
to
three
consecutive
15-year
terms.
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
respondent
subsequently
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
united
states
district
court
denied
the
petition
rejecting
the
contention
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
barred
the
state
from
introducing
evidence
of
his
prior
convictions
on
remand.
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
recognized
that
we
have
previously
applied
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
bar
a
subsequent
capital
sentencing
hearing
and
it
held
that
applying
the
same
double
jeopardy
protection
to
a
non-capital
case
would
not
require
the
announcement
of
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law
in
violation
of
the
non-retroactivity
principle
of
teague
against
lane.
we
disagree
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse.
on
federal
habeas,
the
court
must
survey
the
legal
landscape
as
it
existed
when
the
conviction
and
sentence
became
final
and
it
must
determine
whether
a
state
court
considering
the
defendant's
claim
at
that
time
would
have
felt
compelled
to
conclude
that
the
rule
he
seeks
was
required
by
the
constitution.
in
this
case,
we
conclude
that
the
state
court
would
not
have
felt
so
compelled.
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
pronouncement
of
sentence
has
never
carried
the
constitutional
finality
that
attaches
to
an
acquittal.
although
we
have
recognized
an
exception
to
that
principle
in
bullington
against
missouri
for
capital
cases,
we
have
not
extended
that
rationale
to
non-capital
cases
at
the
time
respondent's
conviction
and
sentence
became
final.
and
in
deed,
several
of
our
cases
pointed
in
the
opposite
direction.
moreover,
the
lower
state
and
federal
courts
were
divided
on
the
question.
we
conclude
that
applying
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
respondent's
subsequent
non-capital
hearing
was
not
dictated
by
precedent
at
the
time
his
conviction
and
sentence
became
final.
we
also
hold
that
neither
of
the
two
narrow
exceptions
to
the
non-retroactive
activity
principle
apply.
and
because
of
our
resolution
of
the
case
on
teague
grounds,
we
have
no
occasion
to
decide
in
this
case
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
to
non-capital
sentencing,
or
whether
the
missouri's
persistent
offender
scheme
is
sufficiently
trial-like
to
invoke
those
protections,
nor
do
we
have
to
consider
the
state's
contention
that
bullington
should
be
overruled.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
