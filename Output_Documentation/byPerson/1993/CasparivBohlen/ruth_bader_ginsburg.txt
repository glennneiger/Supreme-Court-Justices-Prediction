but,
mr.
jung,
what...
the
consequences
of
habitual
offender
in
missouri,
do
i
understand
right
that
the
only
consequence
is
that
the
judge...
that
the
jury
will
no
longer
recommend
the
sentence,
but
that
the
range
would
be
identical?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
case
the
only
difference
was
that
the...
the
jury
would
not
have
an
opportunity
to
set
the
ceiling--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
the
term
of
incarceration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
like
the
usual
add-on
enhancement
of
a
sentence...
missouri...
is
this
scheme
unusual?
that
is
that
habitual
offender
status
doesn't
mean
you
get
an
increased...
you
go
up
to
a
higher
range.
it's
the
same
range.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
if
this
scheme
is
unusual,
or
are
there
other
states
that
have
it
too
where
the
range
is
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
your
view
that
our
choice
is
essentially
between
two
things;
either
we
hold
it
teague-barred
or
we
overrule
bullington,
but
there's
no
way
to
say
that
this...
to
rule
on
the
merits
of
this
question
if
we
incline
toward
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
back...
are
you
saying
that
we
would
get
to
the
teague
question
only
if
we
are
inclined
to
rule
against
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
indication
why,
the
first
time
around,
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
the
prior
convictions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kelley,
your
position
is
clear
that
bullington
should
not
be
extended
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i
wasn't
clear
on
your
answer
to
the
teague
question.
if
we
accept
your
position,
is
there
any
way
we
can
decide
that
question,
or
does
teague
mean
that
we
must
say
if
we're
inclined
to
think
it's
a
wrong
rule,
then
it's
surely
a
new
rule,
so
we
have
to
stop
with
the
new
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
end
result
of
your
argument,
then,
is
that
we
should
hold
this
claim
teague-barred?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
teague
is
a
threshold
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
by
increasing
the
scope
of
punishment,
is
just...
but
here
isn't
it
just
a
question
of
who
sets
the
ceiling?
we
were
told
that
there
is
no
difference
in
the
sentencing
range.
there
would
be
a
difference
in
parole
eligibility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
range
is
rather
large.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
the
only
consequence,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
this
case
would
have
to
go
back,
if
you're
right,
for
an
entire
new
trial
before
a
new
jury;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you
couldn't
have
a
jury
just
come
in
for
the
penalty,
not
having
heard
the
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
would
be
a
whole
new
trial,
but
then
the
jury
would
be
faced
with
that
same
10
to
30
year
range.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
so
you
could
end
up
with
the
identical
sentence
if...
that
would
be
within
the
jury's
prerogative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that...
so
that
within
a
bullington
frame
of
reference,
how
can
one
say
that
the
defendant
has
been
acquitted
of
any
portion
of
this
penalty
if,
as
you
just
said,
he
could
get
the
very
same
penalty...
in
fact,
he
could
get
an
even
higher
penalty?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
they,
in
fact,
prove
the
prior
convictions
the
second
time
around?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
to
that
extent,
it's
quite
different
from
the
assessment
of
life
versus
death,
where
you
take
into
account
aggravating
factors,
mitigating
factors.
here
either
you
had
a
conviction
or
you
didn't.
a
prior
conviction
existed
or
it
didn't
exist.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
are
you
not
appealing
the
sentence?
because
what
you're
saying
is
this
case
has
to
go
back
and
be
retried
on
guilt
or
innocence,
and
then
have
a
jury
determine
the
sentence,
which
will
fall
within
the
same
range,
but
could
be
anywhere
from
10
years
to
30
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
appealing
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
a
sentence,
and
you're
seeking
to
get
the
sentence
set
aside.
indeed,
the
conviction,
because
you
have
to
have
a
whole
new
trial,
under
your
theory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
rather
technical
to
say
that
you're
not
appealing
from
the
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
answer
to
the
teague
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
is
simply
that
the
contrary
authority
was,
as
the
eighth
circuit
said...
they
used
some
adjective
besides
mistaken...
seriously
mistaken,
is
that...
that's
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
that
evidence
is
concerned...
and
i
perhaps
didn't
understand
an
answer
you
gave
to
justice
stevens'
question.
as
i
understand
this
statute,
the
prior
offenses,
it's
just
the
existence
of
the
felony.
there's
nothing
in
here
that
indicates
that
the
circumstances
of
the
felony
are
relevant.
a
persistent
offender
is
one
who
has
pleaded
guilty
to
or
found...
been
found
guilty
of
two
or
more
felonies
committed
at
different
times.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
character
of
the
felonies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
felony
of
indictment,
but
not
the
prior
felonies.
in
other
words,
to
establish
that
someone
is
a
persistent
offender,
you
wouldn't
have
to
show
anything
about
the
character
of
the
prior
convictions
except
that
they
were
convictions
for
felonies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
if
it's
a
persistent
offender?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
intervention,
whether
the
federal
circuit
erred
in
refusing
to
allow
izumi
to
intervene
was
not
a
cosmic
question.
