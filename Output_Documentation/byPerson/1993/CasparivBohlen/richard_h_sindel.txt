mr.
richard
h.
sindel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
missouri
it
is
the
legislator
that
is...
legislature
that
is
responsible
for
enacting
the
laws
that
govern
the
procedures
utilized
in
the
trial
of
criminal
cases.
it
is
the
legislature
that
establishes
what
is
a
criminal
act
and
what
punishment
the
actor
deserves.
it
is
up
to
the
courts
to
interpret
and
to
enforce
these
procedures.
as
the
court
said
in
missouri
v.
hunter,
it
is
the
legislature,
not
the
courts,
that
prescribe
the
scope
of
punishments.
in
this
case,
the
legislature
set
out
in
clear,
unambiguous
terms
the
exact
procedure
that
was
to
be
followed
if
the
state
wishes
to
increase
the
punishment
and
the
scope
of
punishment
for
a
prior
offender,
and
deprive
that
defendant
of
his
valued
right
to
a
jury
determination
of
sentence.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
situation,
because
of
the
crime
that
was
changed
as
a
class
a
felony,
and
there
is
no
higher
punishment
other
than
the
range
of
a
class
a
penalty
unless,
of
course,
it's
a
capital
crime.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
the
range
is
10
years
to
30
years
or
life
imprisonment.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
state
law,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
correct.
there
are
no
separate
bifurcated
proceedings,
except
in
the
capital
context,
in
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
the
jury
would
be
instructed
as
to
the
range
of
punishment,
if
they
were,
in
fact,
to
find
him
guilty
of
the
offense
as
charged,
robbery,
first
degree.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
you
could
end
up
with
a
larger
sentence
as
well.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
but
in
this
situation,
the
most
valued
right
that
was
lost
to
this
defendant
was
his
right
to
have
that
jury
determine
his
sentence.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
our
position
is
not
at
all
that
he
was
acquitted
of
the
penalty.
our
position
is
that
he
was
acquitted
of
the
status
determination
that
he
is
a
prior
or
persistent
offender.
it
is
that
yes-no,
either-or,
fact-driven
determination.
the
state
must
prove,
under
the
legislative
enactments,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
particular
defendant
has
committed
a
felony
in
the
past.
they
must
do
so
by
filing
with
the
information
or
indictment,
the
convictions,
the
nature
of
the
charge,
the
sentence
that
was
imposed.
they
must
bring
to
the
court
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
have
stood
here
and
heard
counsel
refer
to
this
as
a
hearing
or
as
a
ministerial
act.
i
do
not
know
of
other
ministerial
acts
that
must
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
this
particular
situation
it
is
true
that
they
could
submit
to
the
court
certified
records
of
the
conviction.
they
could
use,
if
the
defendant
had
testified,
his
testimony
to
try
and
establish
the
necessity
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
the
second
time
there
were
submitted
certified
copies
of
the
records,
and
the
statute
allows
for
certified
copies
to
be
utilized
by
the
court
in
making
a
prima
facie
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
has
proved
their
case.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
well,
that
is
true.
however,
if
the
conviction
exists,
they
still
have
the
option...
necessity
of
proving
it.
it
is
not
enough...
for
example,
the
state
could
not
have
been
in
a
position
where
after
the
trial
had
been
concluded,
they
then
went
to
the
appellate
court
and
determined...
decided,
well,
we
forgot
or
we
failed
or
we
have
now
recovered
the
certified
documents
necessary
to
prove
our
case,
and
we
want
now
to
be
able
to
submit
those
cases
to
the
court
and
have
a
determination
that
this
individual
is
a
persistent
offender,
and
enhance
the
punishment.
the
state
has
no
right
to
such
an
appeal.
but,
in
fact,
the
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
gave
them
exactly
that
right.
it
gave
them
that
second
bite
of
the
apple,
that
second
crack
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
precludes.
and,
in
fact,
it
violated
the
very
statutes
enacted
by
the
legislature,
by
the
state
of
missouri,
in
order
to
enforce
these
particular
provisions.
the
state
of
missouri,
by
its
statutes,
demands
that
this
determination
be
made
prior
to
submission
to
the
jury
simply
because
that
is
the
only
way
to
make
sure
that
that
individual
is
not
deprived
of
his
valued
right
to
a
jury
determination
of
sentence.
in
this
particular
situation,
the
court
of
appeals
abrogated
that
and
basically
end
run
around
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
ignored
the
legislative
enactments.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i'm
sorry,
the
missouri
court...
state
court
of
appeals,
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
it
is
also
our
position...
i've
heard...
it
is
referred
to
as
a
hearing,
but
there
is
the
option
and
opportunity
to
present
evidence,
and
in
other
state
proceedings
evidence
is
often
presented,
in
the
terms
of
testimony,
and
the
defendant
has
all
the
rights
that
are
available
to
him
at
the
trial.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
well,
if
they...
let's
say
if
i
represent
the
defendant
and
we
could
contend,
a,
the
identity
of
an
individual
named
in
the
certified
copies
is
not
the
defendant.
we
can
contend
that
he
was
not
properly
represented
by
counsel.
we
could
contend
that
it
was
not
a
voluntary
plea
of
guilty.
we
can
contend
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
there
are
a
number
of
factual
issues
that
may,
in
fact,
develop.
and
it's
also
important
to
remember
that
in
the
bullington
case,
the
only
evidence
that
was
presented
in
the
penalty
phase
at
that
trial
was
two
copies
of
the
records
of
conviction.
there
was
no
testimony,
either
in
aggravation
or
mitigation.
so
that
trial
was
as
short
and
concise
and
complete
as
the
trial
that
occurred
in
this
particular
case.
and
it
is
a
trial
that
occurs
in
this
particular
case.
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
trial
proceeding
are
present,
as
well.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
wasn't
the
attorney
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
understand.
he
presented
no
evidence,
but
he
did
make
a
long,
lengthy,
and
aggressive
argument,
a
closing
argument.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
unsuccessful
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
there
are
decisions
from
state
courts
that
hold
that
it
doesn't
extend
to
noncapital
settings.
the
decisions--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--yes,
i
believe
that's
correct.
i
can't
say
for
myself
exactly
what
state
courts
had
decided
or
when.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
state
v....
state
v.
lee
relied
on...
and
in
fact
the
court
indicated
it
was
constrained
by
the
application
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
in
three
or
four
other
state
cases,
all
of
which
were
decided
before
bullington.
and--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--and
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
what
they
said.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
well,
i
believe--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--your
honor...
excuse
me.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
new
rule.
it
is
simply,
as
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
indicated,
a
logical
step
from
bullington.
there's
basically
two
distinguishing
factors
from
bullington
to
this
particular
case.
one
is
the
existence
of
jury
sentencing,
and
clearly
that
makes
no
difference
in
terms
of
the
application
of
bullington,
as
this
court
decided
in
arizona
v.
rumsey.
and
that
also
impacts
upon,
as
justice
stevens
noted,
whether
or
not
there
are
jury
instructions
or
deliberations.
all
those
things
may
not
occur,
and
they
didn't
occur
in
arizona
v.
rumsey
other
than
the
deliberation
that
takes
place
in
the
judge's
mind.
but
in
terms
of
the
teague
issue,
besides
the
fact
that
there
was
jury
sentencing,
which
arizona
v.
rumsey
says
is
not
important,
the
only
other
distinction
is
death
is
different,
which
this
court...
at
the
time
that
bullington
was
decided
every
justice
had
at
least
indicated
that
in
some
opinion
or
another.
but
the
bullington
court
specifically
did
not
rely
on
the
death-is-different
argument.
in
fact,
it
relied...
it
indicated
in
a
footnote
that
we
are
not
deciding
this
case
based
on
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
positions
that
were
represented
by
the
petitioner
at
that
time,
and
decided
only
on
the
double
jeopardy
issue
that
was
presented.
so
we
do
not
believe...
it
was
not
the
court
of
appeals'
words
that
they
stretched
the
holding
in
bullington
to
a...
in
an
application
of
this
case.
they
said
they
did
not
believe
it
was
stretched.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
in
a
footnote--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--i
don't
believe
that
the
existence
of
lower-court
opinions,
in
and
of
itself,
is
enough
to
preclude
an
examination
of
this
particular
issue
under
teague.
for
example,
in
stringer
v.
black
the
same
situation
occured.
this
court
had
determined
the
fact
that
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
concluding
that
the
maynard
v.
cartwright
and
clemons
v.
mississippi
did
not
apply
to
the
particular
situation,
was
incorrect.
and
if...
if,
in
fact,
the
distinguishing
characteristics
that
are
brought
up
by
the
court
when
they
determine
whether
or
not
bullington
is
different
from
these
situations...
and
those
distinguishing
characteristics
uniformly
are,
one,
that
death
is
different,
which
is
not
a
bullington
issue;
and
the
fact
that
it
is
a
judge
rather
than
a
jury
determination,
which
is
not
a
bullington
issue;
and
the
fact
that
this
is...
there
has
been
a
history
in
this
court
of
not
recognizing
that
sentencing
procedures
are
covered
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
it
is
important
to
understand
that
in
terms
of
making
this
sentencing
decision,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
yes-no
answer
to
the
question
of
the
status
of
the
individual
involved.
it
is
not
the
line
drawing
along
a
continuous
spectrum
or
gradient
of
decisions
concerning
what
is
the
appropriate
number
of
years.
it
is
not
our
position
that
there
is
a
correct
number
of
years
that
the
court
is
required
to
determine
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
what
the
court
is
required
to
determine
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
whether
or
not
the
state
has
brought
before
them
convincing
evidence
to
prove
that
this
individual
is,
in
fact,
a
prior
or
persistent
offender
under
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
the...
in
terms
of
deciding
the
sentence,
you're
correct.
but
we
are
not
appealing
the
sentence
that
was
imposed.
we
are
appealing
from
the
fact
that
a
status
determination
was
made
without
any
evidence
to
support
it,
and
the
state
was
allowed
a
second
opportunity
to
return
the
court
after
failing
completely--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--every
case
which
is
returned
to
the
court
for
determination
as
to
whether
or
not...
or
a
new
trial,
is
going
to
have
the
possibility
or
prospects
of
a
new
or
different
sentence.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
under
state
law,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
well
i...
what
i
am
trying
to
emphasize
to
the
court,
that
it
is
not...
we
are
not
appealing
from
the
determination
that
a
15-year
sentence
is
appropriate,
as
opposed
to
a
17-year
sentence,
as
opposed
to
a
30-year
sentence,
as
opposed
to
a
10-year
sentence.
all
those
decisions
are
clearly
within
the
discretion
of
the
court,
or
the
sentencing
body,
whoever
it
may
determine...
be.
but
we
are
appealing
from
the
fact
that
not
only
did
the
defendant
lose
his
right
to
a
jury
determination
of
the
appropriate
sentence,
a
valued
right
in
the
state
of
missouri,
obviously
a
value
right
for
any
particular
defendant,
but
also
that
that
determination
was
made
without
the
evidence
that
the
legislature
demands,
if
you
are
to
follow
the
missouri
statutes.
and
this
particular
situation,
the
court
abrogated
its
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
those
statues
were
followed.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
prior
convictions,
as
well
as
the
elements
of
the
underlying
offense
of
conviction.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
correct.
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
evidence
that's
necessary,
there
are...
there
could
be
a
number
of
criminal
trials
in
which
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
a
sentence
could
be
imposed
where
similar
evidence
was
presented.
for
example,
as
this
court
recognizes,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applied
in
the
united
states
v.
dixon,
an
individual
can
be
found
in
contempt
of
court
and
be
sentenced
based
on
conduct
simply
by
admission
and
judicial
notice
of
the
record
that
the
individual
had
been
served
with
the
decree
of
the
court;
and
if
he
had
pled
guilty
to
the
underlying
offense
that
resulted
in
the
contemptuous
behavior,
a
document
indicating
that
that
particular
plea
of
guilty
had
occurred.
and
those
two
documents,
in
and
of
themselves,
would
be
sufficient
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
i
don't
believe
it's
the
amount
of
time
or
the
amount
of
witnesses
or
the
quality
or
the
quantity
of
the
evidence
that's
presented.
it
is
the
burden
that
the
state
places
upon
the
prosecution
in
order
to
make...
reach
that
determination
and
the
fact
that
they
accord
the
defendant
various
constitutional
rights
that
are
the
equivalent
of
what
he's--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
although
i
would...
i
would
suggest
that
that
very
infrequently
happens.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
if
the
indictment
had
failed
to
allege
or--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--that
would
be
the
end
of
the
game.
just
like
in
bullington
if
the
state
had
failed
to
give
appropriate
notice
of
their
intention
to,
in
fact,
proceed,
and
the
evidence
that
they
intended
to
use
at
the
penalty
phase,
that
would
be...
that
would
be
enough
reason,
and
of
itself,
for
the
trial
court
to
basically
preclude
the
application.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
the
only
reason
i
say
it,
your
honor,
is
that...
i
like
to
think
of
myself
as
a
trial
lawyer,
as
opposed
to
an
appellate
lawyer;
i'm
a
little
unfamiliar
up
here.
but
in
terms
of
situations
like
that,
oftentimes
in...
those
are
results
from
negotiations
and
the
negotiations
go
through
that.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
if
the
judge
in
missouri
indicates
that
he
is
not
going
to
be
bound
by
the
negotiations,
then
he
will
probably
tell
the
parties
that,
and
the
plea
may
then
go
forward,
but
obviously
the
defense
counsel
would
probably
be
well
advised
to
search
for
a
more
lenient
tribunal.
in--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--that's
the
adjective,
i
believe,
that's
in
the
opinion,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
teague
issue,
as
well
there's
also
the
exceptions
of
teague.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
especial
implications
as
far
as
the
first
exception
to
teague,
which
requires
that
new
rules
that
place
an
entire
category
of
primary
conduct
beyond
the
reach
of
the
criminal
law,
or
that
prohibit
imposition
of
a
certain
time
of
punishment
for
a
class
of
defendants
because
of
their
status
or
offense.
which
is
the
application
that
was
used
by
this
court
in
penry
v.
lynough
and
joined
by
all
the
justices
in
making
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
particular
category
in
which
an
individual
may
be
insulated
from
the
determination
or
the
application
of
the
teague
principles.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
in
fact,
does
this,
and
does
provide
this
sort
of
insulating
protection
to
this
particular
defendant
and
to
other
defendants.
it's
very
difficult,
in
many
ways,
to
apply
the
double
jeopardy
principles
to
the
teague
analysis
in
some
ways,
and
this
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
robinson
v.
neil
when
it
determined
that
the
double
jeopardy
applications
in
waller
v.
florida
were
to
be
retroactive.
and
benton
v.
maryland--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
this
situation
is
the
first
time
that
the
court
has
had
to
address
the
double
jeopardy
implications
in
a
teague...
in
light
of
teague.
but
the
difficulty
with
teague...
for
example,
one
of
the
exceptions
in
teague
talks
about
the
accuracy
of
the
proceedings
and
the
fact-finding
proceedings.
the
difficulty
with
applying
the
double
jeopardy
principles
is
double
jeopardy
is
not
necessarily
concerned
with
accuracy.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
it...
there
are,
obviously,
in
the
cases
throughout
this
court's
opinion,
that
accuracy
is
one
of
the
underlying
concepts
in
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
for
fear
that
the
state
use...
with
use
of
their
resources
over
and
over,
will
undermine
the
defendant
and
eventually
be
able
to
obtain
a
verdict,
even
though
he
may
be
innocent.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that...
that
is
conceivably
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
every
situation
in
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
there
is
the
possibility
that
the
actual
determination
of
the...
that
the
offender
is
guilty
or
not
guilty
may
be
undermined
or
undervalued.
and,
in
fact,
this
court
in
ohio
v.
johnson
and
united
v.
scott...
united
states
v.
scott,
the
chief
justice
indicated
that
that
is
not
the
determination,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is,
in
fact,
innocent.
it's
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
proceeding
that
has
occurred
in
which
the
state
has
had
that
opportunity
to
present
its
evidence.
and
in
this
particular
situation,
they
had
the
opportunity.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
do
not
believe
that
our
position...
i'd
like
to
tell
the
court
that
our
position
under
the
second
teague
analysis
is
pristine
and
easily
determined.
i
don't
believe
it
is.
and
that
is
because
the
double
jeopardy
precludes
the
trial
from
taking
place
so
that
there
is
no
accuracy
determination,
there
is
no
fact-finding
process.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
robinson
v.
neil,
in
a
trial,
a
second
trial
could
be
perfectly
fair.
it
could
have...
it
could
be
the
best
trial
in
the
world,
but
that
isn't
the
situation,
and
that's
why
robinson
v.
neil
held
that
double
jeopardy
application
had
to
be
retroactive,
and
that's
why
ashe
v.
swenson
said
that
benton
v.
maryland
was
retroactive,
because
the
procedures
there
were
to
stop
the
second
trial
from
taking
place
at
all.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
in
the
robinson
case?
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
well,
ashe
v.
swenson
obviously
had
some
concerns
for
accuracy
because
the
individual
was
acquitted
the
first
time
around.
they
said,
you
know,
you
basically
had
your
shot.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
in
ashe
v.
swenson,
however,
the
concern
was,
that
as
the
state
admitted
at
that...
in
that
particular
proceeding,
was
that
we
had
used
the
first
trial
simply
to
hone
our
strategies
as
a
dry
run
on
the
subsequent
trial.
and
the
court
recognized
clearly
in
that
particular
situation,
that
that
was
an
accuracy
determination.
i
think,
however,
as
far
as
the
exceptions
under
teague,
our
stronger
argument
is
under
the
first
exception
under
teague.
clearly,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
this
defendant
would
be
insulated
from
any
persistent
offender
status
by
the
failure
of
the
state
to
present
adequate
evidence
at
the
first
hearing.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
the
character
of
the
felony
is
the
felony
itself.
in
other
words--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--that
is
correct.
and--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--no,
that
is
not
true
with
the
dangerous
offender.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
but
it
is
true
of
the
prior
and
persistent
offender.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
allegations
that
were
made,
and
that
was
the
proof
that
was
accepted
when
the
state
got
their
second
crack.
we
believe
that...
in
terms
of
the
teague
analysis,
that
a
persistent
offender
or
someone
who
has
been
charged
as
a
persistent
offender
is
a
category
of
defendants
that
would
be
insulated,
then,
from
the
possibility
of
prosecution,
and
the
state
would
be
precluded
from,
you
know,
relitigating
the
persistent
offender
status
on
that
particular
crime
and
that
particular
case.
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
in
terms
of
the
bullington
decision
and
what
had
occurred,
i
had
heard
it
referred
to
that
it
did
not
have
the
hallmarks
of
the
trial.
but
i
believe
that,
in
particular,
this
proceeding
required
all
the
hallmarks
of
the
trial.
the
defendant
was
afforded
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
his
right
to
counsel,
his
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
witnesses,
and
his
right
to
present
evidence
on
his
own
behalf.
the
state
was
required
to
prove
their
burden
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
failing
that,
the
judge
was
entitled
or
should
have
acquitted
him.
and,
in
fact,
if
the
judge
had
made
the
appropriate
determination
in
this
case
and
had
said
that,
yes,
you
have
failed
in
any
way
to
bring
before
me
any
evidence...
and
i
stress,
as
the
eighth
circuit
did,
they
brought
no
evidence
before
the
court
to
indicate
that
there
was
any
prior
convictions.
in
that
particular
situation,
then,
the
judge
would
have
made
the
appropriate
ruling
and
the
case
would
have
gone
to
the
jury
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
situation.
for
some
reason
unbeknownst
of
the
parties,
the
courts
and
the
prosecutors
failed
to,
in
any
way,
indicate
on
the
record
what
the
situation
was
and
why
that
occurred,
even
when
requested
to
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
case
was
then
sent
back.
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
address
the
concerns
that
have
been
raised
by
the
government
concerning
the
application
of
any
decision
in
this
case
to
the
possible
sentencing
guidelines.
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
distinctions
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
case
involving
mr.
bohlen
and,
in
fact,
the
situation
involving
the
sentencing
guidelines.
first
of
all,
the
standard
of
proof
is
significantly
different;
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that's
sufficient
for
the
government
to
carry
the
weight
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
situations.
and
also
the
court...
this
court
recognized
in
poland
v.
arizona
that
they're
not
going
to
break
up
that
sentencing
determination
into
several
groups
of
minitrials.
but
this
is
a
situation,
in
this
case,
where
there
is
one
verdict
that
was
reached,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
this
individual
had
been...
should
properly
be
classified
as
a
persistent
offender.
the
state
failed
in
their
first
opportunity
to
convince
the
court
that
that
was
appropriate.
they
should
not
have
been
given
a
second
opportunity.
thank
you,
your
honor.
