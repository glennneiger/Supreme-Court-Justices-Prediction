mr.
william
k.
kelley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
make
two
points
this
morning.
the
first
is
that
the
court's
decision
in
bullington
v.
missouri
is
distinguishable
from
this
case
and
does
not
control
the
outcome
here,
and
the
second
point
is
that
the
court
ought
not
to
extend
bullington
to
cover
this
case.
on
the
first
point,
we
submit
that
the
persistent
offender
determination
in
missouri
is
quite
unlike
the
trial-like
process
that
was
at
issue
in
bullington.
in
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
case
like
bullington,
the
procedure
is
very
much
trial-like.
the
court
relied
on
that
factor
heavily
in
bullington,
and
in
this
case,
and
in
persistent
offender
determinations
generally,
those
features
are
not
fully
present.
in
a
capital
case
like
bullington,
because
it
was
like
a
trial
with
a
verdict,
quote,
on
the
question
of
life
or
death,
the
court
thought,
and
was
willing
to
treat
the
outcome
of
that
proceeding
as
though
it
were
analogous
to
be
a
conviction
or
a
verdict
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
persistent
offenders
determination
in
missouri
is
far
different.
unlike
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
case,
that
determination
is
made
by
the
judge
at
a
hearing,
not
a
trial,
outside
the
presence
of
a
jury
prior
to
the
case's
submission
to
the
jury.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
my
point
here,
however,
is
that
the
hearing
in
this
case
is
unlike
the
hearing
that
was
at
issue
in
bullington,
and
also
in
rumsey,
in
that
it
was
not
trial-like.
it
was
merely
a
hearing.
it
was
not...
it
did
not
contain
the
full
measure
of
trial-like
aspects
that
is
typically
at
issue
and
present
in
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
case.
for
example,
in...
under
this
statute,
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
the
full
panoply
of
constitutional
trial
rights,
there
are
no
opening
and
closing
arguments.
in
short,
the
judge
hears
evidence
and
decides
the
factual
question
whether
the
defendant
is
or
is
not
a
persistent
offender,
and
then
the
trial
resumes.
let
me
emphasize
that
the
persistent
offender
determination
is
merely
a
sentencing
factor.
it
is
not
the
outcome
of
the
sentencing
process,
like
a
verdict
or
a
decision
on
life
or
death.
it
is
one
factor
out
of
many
that
lead
to
the
ultimate
imposition
of
sentence.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
justice
o'connor,
our
position
is
that
bullington's
rationale,
under
current
sentencing
practices,
really
only
applies
in
capital
sentencing
proceedings
in
this
country.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
decision
in
bullington
did
not
rest
explicitly
on
the
life
or
death
nature
of
the
inquiry.
but
our
point
is
that
in
the
united
states,
historically
and
today,
the
sentencing
process
is
typically
much
more
freewheeling
and
much
more
discretionary
and
much
more
unfettered
than
is
true
in
the
capital
sentencing
process.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
your
honor,
we
did
not
address
that
issue
in
our
brief
because
the
federal
interest
in
this
case,
we
believe,
is
on
the
merits
of
the
bullington
question.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
quite
true.
i
don't
want
to
misstate
our
position.
our
position
is
that
bullington
ought
not
to
be
extended
outside
the
capital
context;
i.e.
the
context
where
life
or
death
determinations
are
made
after
a
full
trial-like
process.
we
think
it's
quite
clear,
and
we
agree
with
the
state,
that
this
is...
this
case
should
be
teague-barred,
that
extending
bullington
to
this
case
would
be
a
new
rule.
our
primary
concern,
frankly,
in
this
case
is
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
federal
sentencing
system
as
enacted
by
the
sentencing
reform
act.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
we
think
that's
quite
clear,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
discussing
the
issue
and
whether
it
was
a
short
extension
of
bullington
or
an...
indicated
itself
that
it
was
an
extension
of
bullington.
and
in
that
sense
it
clearly
is
a
new
rule,
in
our
position...
in
our
view.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
would
be
a
hard
question.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
the
rationale
of
bullington
would,
of
course,
be
applicable
in
that
situation,
and
you
would
have
to
decide
whether
all
of
the
features
that
were
present
in
bullington
were
present
in
that
system.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
i
have
two
responses.
first,
this
court's
subsequent
decision
in
poland
v.
arizona
emphasized
quite
heavily
the
life
or
death
nature
of
the
decision
in
bullington
and
was
willing
to
treat
that
as
an
implied
acquittal
type
situation.
but
more...
more
importantly,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
states
are
under
no
constitutional
compulsion,
in
the
case
that
you
described,
to
provide
such
procedures.
so
in
such
a
case,
a
state
would
have
the
argument
that
it
ought
not
have
to
pay
the
price
of
not
being
able
to
correct
errors
if
it
provides
defendants
with
more
procedures
to
which...
than
they
are
constitutionally
entitled.
so
there
would
be
an
arguable
distinction
in
that
case.
that,
of
course,
is
not
a
question
the
court
has
to
reach
in
this
case.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
no.
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
the
decision
in
bullington
did
not
rest
on
that.
but
let
me
emphasize
again
that
the
rationale
of
bullington
was
that
because
there
was
this
full
trial-like
process
and
because
it
was
a
question
of
life
or
death,
an
up-down,
yes-no
question,
then
the
court
was
willing
to
treat
the
outcome
of
that
proceeding
as
though
it
were
a
verdict
on
the
question
of
life
of
death,
i.e.
innocent
or
guilty.
that
analysis
stands
alone
in
this
court's
sentencing
cases
relating
to
double
jeopardy.
we
submit
that
it
should
not
be
extended
any
further.
in
this
country
there
has
never
been,
under
traditional
sentencing
practices,
any
impediment
to
the
correction
of
errors
on
resentencing.
this
court,
in
poland
v.
arizona,
declined
to
extend
bullington
outside
the
context
in
which
it
arose,
that
is
where
there
was
a
full
trial-like
procedure
with
an
ultimate
determination
of
life
or
death.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
i
think
it's
quite
plain,
justice
ginsburg,
under
the
teague
analysis,
that
the
new
rule
inquiry
is
a
threshold
question,
so
the
court
could
not
reach
the
merits
and
rule
in
favor
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
if
it
thought
that
would
be
a
new
rule.
whether
the
court
could
overrule
bullington
in
this
case,
even
if
extending
it
would
be
a
new
rule,
is
a
different
question.
we
think
that
there
would
be
a
reason...
reasonable
ground
on
which
to
reach
that
question.
we,
of
course,
have
not
urged
the
court
to
overrule
bullington
in
this
case
simply
because
we
think
it
does
not
require
the
state
to
lose
here.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
we
think,
your
honor,
that
under
teague--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--and
its
progeny,
that
the
claim
clearly
is
teague-barred.
we
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case
and
participate
in
the
case
on
the
merits
both
to
inform
the
court's
analysis
of
whether
this
would
be
a
new
rule;
i.e.
what
are
the
contours
of
the
bullington
analysis.
and
secondly,
and
as
i've
said
more
importantly
from
our
perspective,
to
make
sure
that
whatever
the
court
says
here,
it
does
not
cast
doubt
on
the
integrity
of
the
federal
sentencing
system
as
enacted.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
no,
we
do
not,
justice
stevens.
as
i
said,
our...
the
federal
interest,
really,
here
was
in--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--well,
that
is
not...
that
is
not
at
all
our
position,
justice
stevens.
we're
agnostic
on
the
teague
question.
we
think
however,
of
course,
that
an
analysis
of
teague
would
lead
to
this
claim
being
teague-barred.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
we'd
ask
the
court
to
reverse.
thank
you.
