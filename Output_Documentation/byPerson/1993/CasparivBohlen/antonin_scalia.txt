mr.
jung,
if
you
claim
that
applying
bullington
in
this
case
would
be
wrong,
it
seems
to
me,
a
fortiori,
you
must
claim
that
applying
bullington
in
this
case
would
be
new?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
why
isn't
all
of
this
teague-barred?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
a
wrong
rule,
it's
got
to
be
a
new
rule,
doesn't
it?
