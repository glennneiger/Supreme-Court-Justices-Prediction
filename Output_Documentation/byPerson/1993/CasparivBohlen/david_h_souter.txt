and
it
would
be
new.
the
distinction
would
be
made
because
of
the
heightened
degree
or
the
more
expansive
degree
of
discretion
that
is
involved
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
here,
as
distinct
from
the
degree
of
discretion
in
the...
in
the
bullington
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that
were
the
only
issue
in
the
proceeding,
you'd
have
a
comparatively
strong
argument.
but
that
is
not
the
only
issue
in
the
proceeding,
and
in
that
respect
the...
it
is
different
from
the
bullington
situation,
because
the
degree
of
discretion
that's
left
is
a
broader
degree
of
discretion
than
was
left
in
bullington.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
concerned...
or
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
with
an
entirely
different
accuracy
concern,
and
that
is
the
concern
for
adequate
evidence
before
making
a
determination.
so
that
in
point
of
fact,
to
apply...
to
allow
the
rehearing
on
this
issue
is
going
to
enhance
the
possibility
of
accuracy,
not
undermine
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
good
double
jeopardy
analysis,
but
i
don't
think
it
gets
you
where
you
want
to
go
under
the
second
teague
exception.
