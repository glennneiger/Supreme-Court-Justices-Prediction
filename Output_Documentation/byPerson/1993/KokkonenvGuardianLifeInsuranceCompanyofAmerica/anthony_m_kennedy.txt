justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
in
this
case
there
had
been
a
motion
to
reopen
the
judgment
under
rule
60,
and
the
court
then
had
said
there
are
problems
with
this
settlement
agreement
and
so
i
am
now
going
to
enter
a
new
judgment
which
incorporates
the
settlement
agreement
and
i'm
going
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement
if
i
have
to,
would
that
have
been
an
appropriate
method
of
proceeding
and
could
the
judge
then
have
enforced
the
settlement
agreement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why,
if
he
could
have
done
that
in
the
first
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
just
want
to
make...
get
one
thing
clear.
do
you
concede
or
do
you
not
that
if
the
judge
had
said
when
he
heard
the
settlement
agreement:
i
am
very
interested
in
making
sure
that
this
settlement
agreement
is
honored.
i
therefore
put
the
settlement
agreement
into
the
judgment;
i
make
it
a
part
of
the
judgement.
could
he
have
done
that
and
could
he
have
enforced
it
under
those
premises?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we're
talking
about
the
constitutional
limitations
on
jurisdiction,
why
does
that
depend
on
the
consent
of
both
parties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
he
said
i'm
not
going
to
dismiss
this
suit
unless
it's
incorporated
in
the
judgment?
otherwise,
i'm
going
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yeah.
let
me
just
test
out
one
more
proposition
with
you,
because
there
are
two
undercurrents
to
your
argument.
you
seem
to
resist
the
idea
that
the
judge
of
his
own
motion
could
incorporate
a
settlement
agreement.
suppose
the
jury
is
sent
home
for
the
afternoon
midtrial
because
the
parties
think
they
can
settle,
and
they
do
and
they
tell
the
judge
they
have
a
settlement,
everyone
agrees.
they
judge
said,
fine,
we'll
bring
the
jury
back
tomorrow
morning
and
we'll
make
an
appropriate
order
to
dismiss
this
suit.
the
next
morning
the
parties...
one
of
the
parties
said,
"i've
changed
my
mind,
i'm
not
going
to
settle.
"
the
judge
said,
"don't
do
that
to
me.
"
"you've
made
an
agreement,
you've
got
to
stick
by
it,
i'm
incorporating
that
settlement
in...
and
that
contract
of
settlement
in
the
judgment
whether
you
like
it
or
not.
"
can
the
judge
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
you
say
that
judge
coyle
had
the
authority
to
enforce
his
order.
his
only
order
was
to
dismiss
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
course,
then
he'd
be
a
party
with
access
to
evidentiary
facts
that
are
in
dispute,
and
you
might
have
to
recuse.
[laughter]
