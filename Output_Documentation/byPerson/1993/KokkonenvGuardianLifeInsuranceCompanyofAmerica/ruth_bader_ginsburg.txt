justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying
in
effect
it
would
be
a
new
settlement
agreement.
what
you're
saying
is
the
60(b)
can
reopen
the
proceeding.
then
if
there
is
to
be
restoration
of
the
original
settlement
agreement,
it's
because
the
parties
again
say
to
the
judge
we
have...
this
agreement
was
opened
but
now
we
wish
to
present
the
very
same
agreement
and
come
to
the
same
place
again.
it
wouldn't
be
an...
vacating
the
judgment
under
60(b)
and
then
having
the
settlement
agreement
in
place,
is
that
the
distinction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
any
other
60(b)(6),
the
catchall,
and
the
judge
saying
well,
it
sounds
like
a
pretty
good
60(b)
motion
to
me;
i
was
listening
to
these
two
people
debate
what
their
settlement
was
going
to
be,
and
they
made
certain
representations,
and
one
of
them
is
trying
to
get
out
of
it.
so
i
think
that
fits
the
60(b)(6)
catchall.
it
justifies
relief
to
tell
me
one
thing
and
the
go
do
another
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
didn't
put
it
in
his
order.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
dismissed
the
case
outright.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you...
suppose
your
opponent
is
correct
that
there
was
nothing
here
to
reopen...
that
there
was
nothing
here
to
enforce,
because
all
there
was
was
a
dismissal
with
prejudice,
do
you
think
you
could
go
back
and
say,
well,
alternately,
please
consider
our
case
under
rule
60(b)(6)
and
reopen
the
judgment
because?
you're
not
alleging
fraud;
what
would
be
the
reason
that
you
could
give
if
you
were
proceeding
under
60(b)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you're
using
that
term,
are
you
referring...
you're
not
referring
to,
like,
rule
13
or
rule
14,
or
13671
you're
just
saying
ancillary
jurisdiction,
inherent
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
no
statutory
rules--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
example,
what
case
do
you
have
in
mind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
has
authority
to
enforce
its
orders.
but
here
there
isn't
anything
other
than
a
bare
dismissal
with
prejudice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
too
late
now
for
a
60(b)(3)...
not
for
60(b)(6),
but
you'd
be
too
late,
wouldn't
you,
because
you
didn't
move
for
that
originally?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
that
you
could
treat
your
original
motion
for
enforcement
as
though
it
were
a
60(b)(3)
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
found
yourself
in
this
position,
that
the
other
side,
in
your
judgment,
had
not
carried
out
the
bargain,
did
you
find
other
cases
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
where,
despite
the
failure
to
reserve
jurisdiction,
parties
were
able
to
enforce
a
settlement
agreement
that
was
not
incorporated
in
the
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
reason
you
would
not
have
access
to
the
federal
court
for
this
enforcement
proceeding,
if
it
was
a
de
novo
proceeding,
is
you
no
longer
have
diversity
and
a
mounting
controversy?
what
is
the
lack?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
when
your
adversary
says
you
have
recourse
to
a
state
court
for
breach-of-contract
suit,
you
say
that
you
could
bring
that
as
a
diversity
suit
as
well,
that
you
meet
the
requirements
of
diversity--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
might
not
get
judge...
what
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah.
but
with
60(b),
you
would
get
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
reopening
the
same
judgment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
judge
could
have
said,
i've
presided
over
dozens
and
dozens
of
settlements,
i
don't
remember
this
one
from
any
other,
go
away,
and
you
would
have
nothing
to
complain
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
from
what...
from
your
point
of
view,
having
made
that
concession,
what
is
involved
here
other
than
a
misnomer?
you
go
back...
you
get
rid
of
this
proceeding
and
you
go
back
before
judge
coyle
with
a
60(b)
motion
which
you
will
either...
which
you'll
take
some
position
on,
no
doubt
oppose
it.
what
is
this
accomplishing,
then,
other
than
to
get
the
thing
back
where
it
was
with
a
different
label
on
it?
