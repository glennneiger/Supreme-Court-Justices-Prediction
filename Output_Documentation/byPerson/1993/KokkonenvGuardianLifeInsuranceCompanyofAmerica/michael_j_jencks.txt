mr.
michael
j.
jencks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
the
issue
of
the
scope
of
a
federal
court's
power
to
enforce
a
settlement
agreement
reached
in
a
case
before
it.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
the
district
court
properly
invoked
its
inherent
power
in
enforcing
the
settlement
agreement
in
this
case
where
the
action
was
no
longer
pending,
having
been
dismissed
months
previous,
where
the
action
was
not
incorporated
or
made
a
part
of
any
court
order
or
otherwise
given
judicial--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--yeah.
excuse
me.
thank
you,
mr.--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--that's
correct.
this
was
an...
let
me
turn
to
the
facts,
because
i
think
they're
important
in
this
case.
this
originally
was
a
case
filed
in
state
court.
it
was
removed
on
diversity
grounds
on
account
of
the
respondent's
new
york
citizenship;
raised
only
state
law
claims.
3
days
into
the
trial
of
this
matter,
the
parties
reached
a
settlement
which,
at
the
insistence
of
the
respondent,
was
not
converted
to
a
formal
settlement
agreement.
approximately
5
weeks
later
the
case
was
dismissed
unconditionally
under
41(a)(1),
and
the
parties
went
their
separate
ways,
only
4
or
5
months
after
that
to
come
to
a
major
disagreement
over
the
terms
of
the
settlement
and
who
was
breaching
what
terms.
the
respondent
sought
its
remedy
back
before
the
federal
court,
and
the
petitioner
sought
his
remedy
before
the
state
court.
but,
you're
correct,
the...
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
no
written
settlement
agreement.
this
was
an
oral
agreement
and
never
incorporated
into
an
order,
never
given
judicial
sanction
to
be
made
an
order
of
the
court.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
it
was
summarized
by
one
of
the
counsel
in
chambers
in
front
of
the
district
court
judge,
who
had
taken,
as
many
judges
do,
an
active
role
in
encouraging
the
settlement.
but
it
was
never...
except
for
that
recitation,
the
summarization
in
chambers,
never
made
a
part
of
the
record
or
otherwise
incorporated
into
an
order
of
the
court.
we
have
proposed,
as
have
the
10
states
who
filed
an
amicus
brief,
a
rule
of
practice,
as
it
were,
a
line
where
we
suggest
the
constitutional
concerns
of
the
limited
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
are
met,
and
that
also
serves
an
important
function
as
a
rule
of
practice.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
yes,
justice
o'connor.
i
don't
think
the
federal
rules
confer
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
with
the
single
exception...
and
it
really
doesn't
confer
jurisdiction,
but
rule
60
would
allow,
under
the
proper
circumstances
and
a
showing--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--it
was
not
resorted
to
here.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
the
only...
the
constitutional
question
arises
from
the
district
court
deciding
to
exercise
its
inherent
jurisdiction
to
enforce
this
settlement.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
if
either
party
contesting
the
terms
had
made
a
motion
that
was
granted,
under
the
standards
of
rule
60
the
dismissal
could
have
been
vacated
and
the
case
could
have
been
restored
to
the
docket.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
both
on
the
text
of
the
rules,
but
also
on
a
practical
basis.
in
most
settlements
reached,
the
dismissal
of
the
action
is
obviously
one
of
the
major
elements
of
consideration.
if
you
were
unfolding
the
settlement
for
some
fraud
in
its
procurement
or
other
reason
and
can
convince
a
court
that
to
let
it
stand
and
not
vacate
it
would
perpetrate
some
extreme
hardship
or
great
injustice,
to
fall
under
rule
60.
and
i
want
to...
rule
60
i
don't
believe
is
available
for
every
breach
of
a
settlement
agreement
that
may
occur.
i
think
it...
its
history,
its
usage,
its
application,
we
can
assume
it
to
be
a
much
more
of
a
reserved--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--i
don't
believe
so
under
the
facts,
even,
that
the
district
court
found
of
the
breach,
of
the
alleged
breach
of
the
settlement
agreement.
had
they
made
the
motion--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--certainly,
i
think
there
could
be
cases
where
either
there
was
a
clear
fraud
in
the
procurement
of
the
settlement,
or
perhaps
a
changed
circumstance.
for
example,
something
that
has
happened
in
this
case
was
a
change
in
state
law
that
makes
one
of
the
terms
of
the
settlement--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--i
don't
think...
i
guess
the
circumstance
of
the
parties
could
be
such,
that
would
be
the
only
way
to
avoid
great
hardship.
but
i
think,
generally,
simple
breach
of
a
settlement
agreement
would
not
qualify
for
a
rule
60
setaside.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
the
question
of
the
scope
of
inherent
jurisdiction
here
is
this
case,
because
i
think
we
are
prepared
to
concede
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
inherent
jurisdiction,
and
in
some
situations
it
may
apply
to
the
enforcement
of
settlement
agreements.
in
fact,
that
is
exactly--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--why
we've
adopted
and
suggested
to
the
court
the
rule
of
practice.
because
if
you
take
a
settlement
agreement
and
incorporate
it
into
an
order,
you
give
it
judicial
sanction,
you
can
access
one
of
the
bedrock
principles
of
inherent
jurisdiction
where
the
exercise
of
the
inherent
power
is
indispensable,
is
essential
to
the
performance
of
the
power
formally
granted.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
apologize
if
i
indicated
we
didn't.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
in
this
case,
in
the
way
we
would
view
a
proper
scope
of
inherent
jurisdiction,
it
would
be
the
power
to
vindicate
and
enforce
the
court's
own
orders.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
that's
right.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
that's
right,
and
that's
why
we
believe--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--i
think...
excuse
me,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
court
has
the
power
to
vacate,
upon
a
proper
application
under
rule
60,
the
order
of
dismissal.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
maybe
you
misunderstood--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--no,
justice
stevens,
i
apologize.
let
me...
the
issue...
i
was
talking
about
our
proposed
rule
that
tried
to
access
a
well
established
principle
for
the
exercise
of
inherent
jurisdiction
that
would
anchor
this
enforcement
mechanism
constitutionally
and
in
a
way
that's
supported
by
existing
authority.
it's
really
in
some
ways
the
counterpart
to
this
court's
addressing
the
discipline
or
sanctions
side
in
chambers,
in
the
chambers
decision,
where
the
need
to
access
or
discharge
a
disciplinary
function
is
essential
or
viewed
as
essential
to
the
court's
maintenance
of
the
order
of
its
proceedings
and
the
conduct
of
its
business.
i
think
much
the
same
thing
can
be
said
about
the
inherent
power
necessary
to
enforce
and
vindicate
orders
that
have
been
given
judicial
sanction
by
the
court.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
kennedy.
the...
as
i
understand--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--i
think
that
the
remedy
provided
by
rule
60
to
unwind
an
order
or
set
aside
an
order
or
judgment
of
the
court
is
premised
on
restoring
the
parties
to
the
position
they
were
before
they
gave
up,
in
this
case
the
dismissals
that
they
reached
in
connection
with
the
settlement.
different
issues,
it
would
go
back
on
the
calendar,
in
our
position,
and
should
be
tried
and
resolved.
the
issues
are
different--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--he
could
have
incorporated
with
the
parties'
consent.
this
was
still
a
voluntary
private
settlement
agreement.
i
think
had
they
agreed
that
they
wanted
to
retain
federal
court
oversight
and
jurisdiction
over
the
enforcement
of
this
settlement,
that
would
have
been
exactly
the
course
to
take.
and
what
we're
suggesting
should
be
the
rule
where
the
parties
decide
to
use
the
district
court's
continued
jurisdiction
as
a
means
of
enforcement,
they
also
could--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--as
i
under...
i
believe
i
understood
you
to
ask
if...
could
the
court
simply
on
its
own,
sua
sponte,
take
the
parties'
agreement,
regardless
of
their
consent,
and
incorporate
it
in
the
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
fine.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
puts
it
directly
to
the
parties
to
decide,
in
their
negotiation,
whether
that's
the
way
they
wanted
to
go,
or
whether
they
wanted
to
proceed
with
the
trial
and
have
a
judgment.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
with
a
simple
statement
expressly
retaining
jurisdiction?
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
if
the
basis
of
the
settlement
was
recited
in
the
judgment,
i
think
there
would
be--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--and
the
case
was--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--if
the
basis...
well,
one
of
the
hopes
is
to
trigger
the
existing
rules
and
remedies.
for
example,
in
rule
65(d)
there's
requirements
about
the
precision
and
the
detail--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--that
must
be
given
in
an
injunctive
order.
and
most
of
the
terms
of
this
settlement
would
fall
under
that.
they
were
essentially
injunctive;
you
shall
not
communicate
or
you
shall
return
files.
the
hope,
or
one
of
the
notions
by
incorporating
it
in
some
order,
is
to
require
or
have
the
existing
rules
apply
regarding...
that
have
been
well
worked
out,
including
the
specificity
of
the
order.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
my
position
would
be
that
the
existence
of
the
judgment
could
confer
jurisdiction.
there
may
be,
depending
on
the
detail,
enforceability
problems
in
terms
of
the
rest
of
it,
but
there
would
be
jurisdiction
if
the
judgment
was,
in
fact,
entered
and
given
judicial
sanction.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
if
the
court--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--if
the
court...
i
don't
think
parties
can
privately
necessarily
contract
for
jurisdiction,
but
upon
judicial
scrutiny
and
his
entry,
that
could...
would
be
done.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
a
jurisdictional
problem.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
the
jurisdiction,
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
justice
souter,
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement
after
vacating
the
dismissal
under
a
rule
60
motion,
i
believe
runs
into
the
difficulty
that
the
breach
of
a
settlement
agreement,
the
breach
of
a
private
contract,
is
going
to
be
fundamentally
different.
different
proof,
different
tests--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--i
don't
believe
so.
i...
the
choice
of
the
parties
in
that
situation
would
be
either
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board,
vacate
the
dismissal
on
60(b),
or
follow
their
remedies
for
breach
of
the
contract.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
not
as
i
understand
the
evidence
that
was
presented
on
the
motion
to
enforce,
though
the
motion
to
enforce
would
have
different...
a
different
showing.
it's
a
different
test.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
no.
i
know.
i'm
only
saying
in
terms
of
the
respondent's
position
about
what
they
view
as...
they
chose
not
to
file
a
rule
60(b)
motion.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
well,
let
me...
let
me
give
you
the
best
example.
there
was
a
change
in
the
insurance
code
of
the
state
of
california.
it
actually
made
a
misdemeanor
not
to
disclose
certain
information
that
you...
as
an
insurance
agent,
you
receive
from
a
client.
that
communication
is
prohibited
as
a
term
of
the
settlement
here.
you
have
a
change
in
the
law
that
affects
the...
one
of
the
important
terms
of
the
settlement.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
i
don't
believe
that
on
a
routine
breach
situation
there
is.
i
think
that
the
interest
in
finality,
of
encouraging
parties
to
reach
a
final
enforceable
good
settlement...
settlement
alone
isn't
a
good
enough
goal;
we
need
effective
settlements
that
will
clear
the
court's
dockets.
here
we
had
a
situation
where
the
parties
by
choice
never
converted
this
agreement
to
writing,
didn't
want
it
incorporated
in
any
order
of
the
court.
they
have
their
remedies,
either
to
come
in
on
60(b)
or
to
enforce
privately.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
or
the
degree
of
injustice
or
hardship
that
it
conventionally
is
reserved
for
either,
i
think,
in
the
case
law.
it's
not
an
automatic...
i
don't
read
it
and
i
don't
believe
it's
been
interpreted
as
an
automatic
escape
valve
whenever
you
get
a
few
months
down
the
road
and
things
aren't
perfect.
the
idea
is
to
encourage
parties--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--it...
in
terms
of
a
private
agreement,
you
could
have
a
conclusion
under
60(b)(6)
that
it
should
be
set
aside.
but
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
you
need
to
show...
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
parties
here
chose
not
to
bring
that
motion.
they
chose
to
enforce...
the
respondent
tried,
by
a
motion,
to
enforce
before
the
district
court
judge;
the
petitioner
chose
to
enforce,
in
state
court,
the
agreement.
but
i
think
conceivably
you
could
have
a
60(b)(6)
motion
that
would
offer
relief
on
some
kinds
of
breach
cases.
i
just
don't
think
that
on
an...
absent
some
fraud
and
absent
some
hardship,
it
is
often
going
to
make
the
cut.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
i
don't
believe
so.
the
only
justification
for
that
would
be
if
it
was
viewed
in
terms
of
the
statements
to
the
court.
i
would
access...
the
only
way
that
could
happen
would
be,
in
effect,
as
a
form
of
sanction.
if
representations
were
made
to
the
court,
the
court
was
misled,
act
in
reliance
on
it,
it
seems
to
me
you
may...
might
be
able
to
justify,
then,
imposing
the
agreement
on
the
parties.
the...
one
of
the
keys
here
is
to
try
to
encourage
the
private
settlement
mechanism
that
generally
is
working,
and
many
cases
are
settling.
i
think
it's
one
of
the
things
where
instead
of
having
a...
sort
of
a
roving
jurisdiction
to
mop
up
the
loose
ends
and
the
odd
bits,
it
is
a
case
where
maybe
form
is
substance.
that
is
it's
important
to
let
the
private
process
do
its
best,
to
give
incentives;
in
effect
to
address
dispute
resolution,
liquidated
damages,
other
mechanisms
to
enforce
their
own
contract,
and
as
one
of
those
options
to
decide
whether,
by
converting
it
to
a
court
order,
to
avail
themselves
of
the
assistance
of
the
federal
court.
i
think
we
do
that
by
drawing
a
bright
line
that
indicates
what
side
of
the
line
settling
parties
will
fall.
they
will
know
when
they
reach
their
agreement
if
they
will
fall
on
the
side
of
continued
federal
jurisdiction
or
not.
if
i
may--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--yes.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
tin.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
couple
of
points.
i
want
to
emphasize
again
the
point
that
came
out
in
the
questioning.
the
respondent
has
remedies
here.
statutes
haven't
run,
for
example,
to
pursue
a
state
action.
there's
an
ongoing
state
action
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement
brought
by
mr.
kokkonen.
the
respondent
is
appearing
and
participating
in
that
case,
and
it's
at
issue.
there
are
remedies
here.
they
made
a
series
of
choices,
for
whatever
business
purposes,
confidentiality
and
the
like,
to
not
have
this
settlement
reduced
to
writing
and
not
incorporated
in
an
order
of
judgment
of
the
court.
the
dismissal
was
expressly
with
prejudice.
that
was
the
stipulation
of
the
parties.
and
i
think
here
they're...
they
have
other
remedies
to
pursue.
they
may
have
a
60(b)
motion
if
they
can
meet
some
of
the
time
concerns
that
respondents'
counsel
discussed
with
justice
ginsburg.
they
are
not
without
a
remedy.
they
are
not
stranded
here.
and
it's
really
a
situation
very
much
of
their
own
making
and
choice
and
tactics,
and
i
don't
see
that
the
district
court--
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
--i
think
there's
a
difference
whether
we
choose...
whether
either
of
the
parties
chooses
to
go
back
on
a
60(b)
motion
to
reopen
the
previous
proceedings,
or
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement.
counsel...
the
enforcement
of
the
settlement
agreement
may
be
able
to
be
in
federal
court.
it's
not
directly...
there's
a
state
brief
here
that
reads...
makes
it
sound
like
a
turf
battle.
it's
really
not
that,
because
some
of
these
cases
will
still
default
to
federal
court.
mr.
michael
j.
jencks
thank
you.
