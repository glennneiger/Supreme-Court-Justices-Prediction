mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
would
submit
that
the
rule
that
petitioner
seeks
in
this
case
is
a
rule
that
after
3
days
of
trial,
and
with
the
apparent
view
that
they
were
going
to
face
an
imminent
loss
in
that
trial,
they
initiate
settlement
discussions;
the
district
court
judge
becomes
incredibly
involved
in
those
discussions,
in
the
clarification
and
the
refinement
of
that
settlement
agreement;
upon
agreement
to
a
settlement
at
the
initiation
of
petitioner,
within
days
of
the
settlement
agreement
the
petitioner
breaches
that
agreement.
petitioner's
rule
here
would
leave
the
federal
court
and
the
federal
court
processes
powerless
to
deal
with
that
situation
and
powerless,
as
well,
to
provide
relief
to
the
aggrieved
party.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--that's
true,
justice
scalia.
however,
in
this
case
the
breach,
though
close
in
time,
was
not
before
the
court
when
the
stipulation
and
order
for
dismissal
was
signed
by
judge
coyle.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
right
in
another
case,
your
honor.
but
we
would
submit
that
what
actually
happened
in
this
case
is,
in
fact,
the
constructive
equivalent
of
just
that.
you
asked
the
question
earlier
of
whether
this
settlement
agreement
was
written.
it
was
not
written
in
a
separate
document,
but
it
is
contained
in
writing
in
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings,
every
single
word
of
it,
before
the
district
court
judge,
in
which
the
agreement
was
not
read
by
one
party.
it
was
a
negotiation
process
by
both
parties
and
in
which,
i
would
also
observe,
the
petitioner
himself,
mr.
kokkonen,
was
also
involved
in
the
colloquy
on
the
record
with
the
judge.
and,
in
fact,
judge
coyle
specifically
explained
several
of
the
provisions
to
which
mr.
kokkonen
said,
yes,
that's
a
good
statement,
sir,
i
agree.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
but
we
believe
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case...
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
there
was,
in
effect,
an
embodiment
of
what
was
going
to
be.
what
was
agreed
to
by
the
parties
is
the
settlement
agreement.
we
have
the
constructive
equivalent
of
the
embodiment
of
the
agreement
in
the
order--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--when
stripped
of
the
too
many
adjectives,
your
honor,
i
think
what
that
means
is
this.
judge
coyle
on
three
separate
occasions
made
it
clear
to
the
parties
that
he
envisioned
if
there
had
to
be
any
enforcement
activity
in
this
case,
that
it
was
coming
back
to
him,
not
to
the
state
court.
he
said
i
want
this
clear.
i
want
everyone
to
understand
the
agreement.
and,
indeed,
on
three
other
occasions,
as
reflected
in
the
transcript,
he
also
indicated
at
various
points
he
didn't
think
there
was
an
agreement.
and
what
you
therefore
have
in
this
case
is
the
enormous
involvement...
this
is
not
a
case
of
the
parties
simply
going
back
and
forth
saying,
okay,
your
honor,
we've
reached
agreement;
we're
going
to
tender
to
you
a
stipulation.
rather,
the
district
court,
part
and
parcel
of
that
settlement,
helped
frame
it
and
made
sure
that
both
he
and
the
parties--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--he
didn't--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--that's...
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
would
have
available
to
us
not
only
60(b)(6),
but
60(b)(3).
because
if
it's
not
fraud...
and
it
might
be...
it
certainly,
we
would
suggest,
was
a
misrepresentation.
because
the
record,
i
think,
and
what
judge
coyle
found
in
enforcement
proceeding,
that
he
had
stubbornly
and
unjustifiably
refused
to
comply,
and
that
he
had
blatantly
breached
the
agreement.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i'm
not
sure
it
gets
us
only
the
lawsuit,
because
i
believe...
we
would
submit
that
once
the
case
is
properly
back
before
the
district
court,
the
district
court
not
only
may
reopen
and
put
the
lawsuit
back
on
the
calendar.
we
believe
that
the
better
view
of
the
law
is
those
cases
which
take
the
position
that
if
the
case
is
properly
back
on
the
docket,
any
order
which
could
have
been
entered
at
a
prior
time
is
then
appropriate.
and
the
law...
among
all
the
circuits,
none
have
disagreed
with
this
proposition...
is
in
a
case
on
the
docket,
a
court
may
enforce
a
settlement
agreement
that
is
reached.
and
we
believe
that
if
this
case
when...
was
back
before
the
court...
and
we
believe,
in
fact,
that
our
motion
to
enforce--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
there's
reason
to
bring
the
matter
bring
and
for
the
court
to
act,
either
under
rule
60
or
under
its
ancillary
jurisdiction,
to
give
effect--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--well,
we
believe
there's
ancillary
jurisdiction
to
enforce,
your
honor,
so
we
would
part
with
you
there.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
the
short
answer
to
that
is--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--to
enforce...
there
would
be
no
express
time.
ancillary
jurisdiction
we
believe
provides
the
basis
for
enforcement
in
this
case,
and
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
should
be
exercised
in
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
the
district
court
judge's
sound
discretion,
informed
by
the
facts
of
the
case.
and
whether
they
choose
at
all,
whether
he
or
she
chooses
at
all--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--perhaps
tested
by
appeal,
but,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
it...
it
used
the
phrase,
i
believe,
the
inherent
power.
the
decisions
of
the
ninth
circuit...
and
there
are
three
decisions
of
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
if
you
read
all
three
of
those
decisions
of
the
ninth
circuit,
in
wilkinson,
in
dacanay,
and
in
our
own
case,
that
the
concept
here
is
that
there
is
inherent
or
ancillary
power
to
enforce,
in
appropriate
circumstances,
a
settlement
agreement.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
the...
i
don't
know
that
there
is
an
absolutely
precise
definition
if
you
read
many
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
for
purposes
of
how
the
courts
frequently
categorize
this,
the
answer
i
would
say
is
yes,
although
i
understand
there
may
be
circumstances
where
they
are
different.
i
don't
think
that
difference
here,
however,
is
material
to
whether
or
not
judge
coyle
had
the
authority
to
enforce
his
prior
order.
i
think
there
are
many
cases
of
this
court
under
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
principles,
which
is
our
primary
ground
upon
which
we
believe
enforcement
here
in
appropriate,
where
the--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
not
in
the
narrow...
perhaps
the
most
frequently
today
encountered
phrase...
use
of
the
phrase,
ancillary
jurisdiction,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
we
believe
that
what
he
did
here,
in
effect,
with
the
substantial
proceedings
in
chambers
and
his
participation,
that
we
had,
in
effect,
a
much...
a
broader
order
than
the
narrow
stipulation
which
is
all
that
is
on...
entered
on
the
docket,
the
narrow
stipulation
in
his
order
dismissing
the
case.
but
we
would
take
the
view
that
in
this
case...
and
we
believe
this
case,
frankly,
presents
somewhat
unique
facts,
and
that
on
these
facts
we
were
entitled
to
have
what
judge
coyle
did
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
also
found
appropriate.
we
would
also
observe
that,
of
course,
when
we
brought
the
motion
to
enforce
in
this
matter,
we
were
proceeding
in
a
circuit
that
said
that's
all
you
need
to
do.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
our
position
that,
in
fact,
we
essentially
have
the
writing
of
the
agreement
here.
the
writing
is
the
reporter's
transcript.
and
contrary
to
the
suggestion,
both
parties--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
our
view
of
that
is
on
these
facts
there
is
ancillary
jurisdiction.
that
going
back
to
the
earliest
years
of
this
country,
the
courts
have,
on
selected
occasions,
used
ancillary
jurisdiction
to
see
to
it
that
prior
judgments
have
not
been
misused,
inequitably
used.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--well,
justice
scalia,
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
there
are
a
number
of
instances,
as
cited
in
our
brief,
where
this
court
has
said
that
if
there
was
once
proper
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts,
there
can
be
ancillary
jurisdiction
based
on
that
original
prior
federal
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
the
cases
where...
they
come
in
a
number
of
varieties.
the
cases
where
there
were
judgments
entered,
the
cases
went
off
the
books,
and
where...
in
one
of
the
principal
cases
that
we
cite,
the
julian
v.
central
trust...
the
court,
in
aid
of
its
prior
decree
in
a
mortgage
foreclosure
situation
and
when
there
was
going
to
be
a
state
court
action
that
called
into
question
the
transfer
of
the
property
in
that
case,
entered
further
orders.
we
have
cases
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
where
the
courts--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--well,
we
have
attorney's
fees
cases,
justice
ginsburg,
where
the
case
is
dismissed
but
the
court,
after
the
dismissal,
deals
with
the
attorney's
fees.
we
have
contempt
cases
where
the
case
is
dismissed
and
the
court
deals
with
the
contempt.
we
have
those
circumstances
where
the
courts
quite
clearly,
after
dismissal,
have
had
to
address
various
issues.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
the
action
that
would
be
the
basis
occurred...
would
have
occurred,
certainly,
justice
stevens,
during
the
live
period
of
the
case
before
the
court.
but
in
many
instances...
in
some
instances,
at
least,
the
addressing
of
the
contempt
and
whether
punishment
is
warranted
and
what
punishment
would
be
warranted
may
be
done
after
the
dismissal
of
the
substantive
case
wherein
the
contempt
was
committed.
and
so
too
with
attorney's
fees
issues.
the
substantive
case
may
have
gone
away--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--in
a
contempt...
i
am
not
aware
of
any
contempt
cases--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--where
an
action
of
a
contempt
nature
would
be
after
the
case
was
dismissed.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
if...
it
would
probably...
i
believe
the
answer
would
probably
be
it
would
have
to
be
those
matters
which
would
be
properly--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--proper
relief
in
the
case.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
yes,
absolutely.
it's
relatively
simple.
really,
there
are
only
a
couple
of
provisions:
that
he
would
turn
back
over
to
the
guardian
various
files
that
he
had
improperly
retained,
and
that
he
would
not
act
as
a
representative
in
seeking
information
on
behalf
of
continuing
clients
of
his.
those
were
the
only...
really
the
two
essential
provisions.
he
was
to
pay
the
guardian
some
money,
and
that
was...
those
were
the
essential
terms
ultimately
agreed
to
after
the
intervention.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
it
may
be
or
it
may
not
be.
the
reason
i
say
may
not
be,
under
the
normal
reading
of
the
rule
we
have
a
1...
we
would
have
a
1-year
period
to
seek
60(b)(3)
relief.
i
do
not
know,
however,
for
sure
whether
because
of
the
ensuing
litigation
and
the
california
doctrines
of
equitable
tolling,
whether
there
may
be
an
argument
that
the
continuing
litigation
in
this
matter
provides
a
basis
where
the
1-year
period
would
have
been
considered
to
be
tolled.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
and
we
would
suggest
more
than
that,
justice
ginsburg,
that,
in
fact,
our
original
motion
to
enforce,
appropriate
under
the
ninth
circuit
law
at
the
time,
did
all
that
a
60(b)(3)
motion
could
have
done.
it
put
the
petitioner
on
notice
that
he
had
to
defend.
it
told
him
what
we
believed
the
actions
at
issue
were,
and
it
told
him
what
we
were
seeking
in
the
case.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
there
are
cases
cited
in
our
brief
and
professor
morris'
treatise
that
say
rule
60
is
to
be
liberally
construed,
and
there
is
some
authority
for
treating
it
liberally.
and
we
would
suggest
that
it
would
not
be
so
strange
where
every
real
function
that
60(b)
is
intended
to
serve
was
met
by
our
action
with
the
motion
to
enforce,
which
was
the
motion
under
the
law
of
the
circuit
that
was
appropriate.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
if
we're
proceeding
under
rule
60,
that's...
i
believe
that
would
be
correct.
we
are
also
saying
as
an
alternative
ground
here,
that
judge
coyle,
under
the
rubric
of
ancillary
or
we've
used
the
phrase
also
inherent
jurisdiction,
had
authority
to
enforce.
there
the
discretion
is
has
the
district
court's
involvement
in
the
case,
has
the
utilization
of
the
federal
resources
been
such
that
it
makes
sense
that
the
court,
though
having
jurisdiction,
should
choose
whether
to
entertain
the
enforcement
or
whether
not
to
entertain
it.
and
so
in
the
ancillary
area,
it
is
our
view
that
the
court,
though
having
jurisdiction
to
enforce
our
motion...
to
entertain
our
motion,
did
not
necessarily
have
to.
and
we
would,
indeed,
submit
that
in
the
greater
majority
of
cases
district
court
judges
are
likely,
probably,
not
to.
you
can
take
the
whole
range
of
the
kinds
of
circumstances
where
a
settlement
may
have
occurred,
and
you
could
say
some
of
them
will
be
right
after
a
demand
letter
and
a
draft
complaint.
the
chances
of
there
being
any
reason
why
a
district
court
would
entertain
a
motion
to
enforce
in
that
circumstance
is
virtually
nil.
we
could
have
a
midpoint
where
the
issue
has
been
joined
in
a
case,
where
there's
been
rule
16
conference
held,
where
there's
been
some
litigation
in
the
case,
where
probably
a
district
court
judge
would
conclude
no
reason
to
get
invested
in
the
enforcement
in
that
matter.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
no.
in
a
consent
decree
you...
i
believe--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--well,
it's...
a
consent
decree,
i
think
almost
by
virtue
of
its
very
nature,
will
have
exactly
the
provision
that
you
have
described.
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
we
do
not
believe
that
that
kind
of
language
on
these
peculiar
facts
was
warrant...
was
necessary
here.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
it
certainly
is
the
safer
procedure
and
it
eliminates
the
possible
position
we
have
here.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
no
question
but
what...
if
that
language
is
there,
we
resolve
the
problem.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
oh,
i
agree.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
better,
prudent
practice
would
be
to
do
so,
and
certainly
in
a
consent
decree
where
there
is
probably
a
notion
of
a
more
vigilant
district
court
role
in
enforcing
the
terms
of
a
consent
decree.
in
this
particular
circumstance,
though,
as
i
say,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
actions
of
the
district
court
here
are
highly
unusual
in
the
way
that
the
court
became
involved,
in
the
way
that
the
court
expressly
said
that
it
was
important
to
the
district
court
judge
to
understand
and
to
make
sure
that
there
was
agreement.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
there
are
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
where
dismissals
have
been
set
aside
and
where
settlement
agreements
that
have
been
breached
were
enforced
by
the
district
courts.
this
is
not
a
completely
sui
generis
case
in
that
sense.
there
is
certainly
no
precedent
in
this
court
that
addresses
this
particular
case
and
clearly
states
that
there
is
ancillary
jurisdiction
or
constructive...
or
constructively
the
compliance
with
rule
60
in
this
particular
circumstance.
there's
no
precedent
here.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
is
our
exclusive
remedy.
i
believe
we
could
have
gone...
that
we
could
have
gone
to
state
court,
but
that
would
have
been
a
stranger
forum,
whereas
judge
coyle
had
been
so
heavily
involved
in
seeing
this
agreement
come
together,
in
making
sure
that
he
and
the
parties
both
understood
it,
and
in
telling
the
parties
that
if
there
was
an
enforcement
action
he
anticipated
it
would
be
before
him.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
we
would
not
concede
that
we
no
longer
have
diversity
jurisdiction.
we
believe
we
merit...
very
well
may.
we're
still
citizens
of
different
states,
as
far
as
we
know,
and
we
have
the
value
of
the
files
that
were
not
returned
to
us
and
we
can
probably
assert
a
fraud
claim.
so
i
think
we
could
probably...
with
regard
to
the
alleging
$50,000
in
damages,
i
believe
that
we
could,
in
good
faith,
make
that
allegation
in
this
case.
so
i
believe
that
we
would
have
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct,
judge
ginsburg.
i
believe
that
is
correct.
obviously,
we
haven't
yet
had
the
occasion
to
test
that
fully,
but
that
is
my
belief
at
this
time.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
that's
precisely
the
point
that
we
make,
and
that's
where
we
do
think
the
important
policies
around
settlement
come
in
here.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
coyle.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
i
would
assume
that
we
could
say
that
this
was
a
related...
yeah.
i
mean,
well,
first
of
all,
if
it's
60(b),
even
if
we
went
in
as
an
independent--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--yes.
even
if
we
went
in
as
an
independent
action,
i
think
we
could
probably
say
that
this
was
a
related
case
and
seek
to
have
it
placed
before
judge
coyle.
we
may
or
may
not
succeed
with
that,
but
i
think
it
would
certainly
be
a
claim
that
we
could
make.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
perhaps,
perhaps,
justice
kennedy.
i
mean,
he
made
it
clear
at
the
hearing
in
this
case,
though,
that
he
was
well
aware
of
what
the
terms
of
the
settlement
were,
and
that
there
had
been
a
breach
in
this
case.
i
mean,
that's
evident
on
the
record.
i
mean,
there
could
not
have
been
a
clearer
indication
from
judge
coyle.
so
what
we
suggest
here
is
that
under
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
these
circumstances,
we
had
a
basis
for
enforcement.
but
that's
our...
that
is
our
initial
belief,
and
we
believe
it
is
a
basis
for
why
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
there
was
a
question
as
to
why
this
case
was
in
court?
in
was
in
court
under
28
u.s.c.
1331.
we
had
diversity...
there
was
diversity
jurisdiction.
that's
the
basis
for
why
the
case
was
there.
if,
however,
the
court
believes
that
there
has
to
be
an
express
statement
reserving
jurisdiction,
we
believe
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
there
is
sufficient
indication
in
what
went
on
in
chambers,
in
what
judge
coyle
said
and
what
he
did
and
the
parties'
agreement
to
that.
the
parties
agreed--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--well,
that's
an
interesting...
that's
a
good
question,
justice
souter,
because
when
you
first
read
that
you
could
easily
draw
the
opposite
conclusion;
go
anyplace,
but
don't
come
back
to
my
courtroom.
i
think,
however,
if
you
read
the
entire
transcript
of
the
proceeding
before
him
wherein
the
settlement
was
agreed
to,
that
what
he
makes
clear
is
that
he
envisioned
that
any
enforcement
action
would
be
before
him.
at
joint
appendix
page
81
he
said,
i
must
find
out
what
you
people
agreed
to.
and
later
on
joint
appendix
81
he
said,
my
concern
is
you
all
understood
what
you've
agreed
to,
and
for
that
reason
he
brought
up
one
practical
matter...
i'm
quoting...
he
could
see
that
problem,
and
he
didn't
want
to
see
that
problem
come
back,
he
wanted
it
resolved
now.
and
one
of
our
younger
colleagues,
perhaps
a
bit
more
brashly
than
we
would
have,
at
the
end
of
this
process
said
to
judge
coyle,
judge,
do
you
understand?
and
the
judge's
response,
at
page
86
of
the
joint
appendix,
was,
oh,
i
understand.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
in
retrospect
it
clearly
would
have
been
better
had
we
done
so...
in
retrospect.
but
we
believe
that
it's
still
capable
of
being
enforced
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
we
didn't
believe
that
xx
was
a
mistake.
we
didn't
anticipate
that
we
would
have
the
problem,
but
that
problem
did,
in
very
short
order,
emerge.
on
march
5th
the
settlement
was
reached
in
chambers
on
the
record.
in...
by
april...
by
early
april...
we
had
the
dismissal
order
april
13th
and
we
had
breach
in
april,
and
we
were
back
with
our
motion
to
enforce...
there's
no
long
lapse
of
time
here.
one
of
the
suggestions
that's
made
is,
well,
you
can
have
a
long
lapse
of
time.
we
were
before
judge
coyle
again
with
a
motion
filed
on
may
21st,
and
we
were
in
hearing
before
him
on
june
29th,
all
these
dates
of
1992.
so
from
the
date
of
the
agreement,
march
5th,
until
judge
coyle
held
our
hearing,
it
was
march
5th
to
june
29th.
that's
the
modest
timeframe
that's
involved
here.
there
will
be
other
cases
where
the
timeframe
is
grossly
different
and
where
the
district
court
judge
there
will
rightly
choose
not
to
exercise
his
or
her
discretion,
but
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
a
case
where
that's
a
problem.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
that's
not
our
contention,
justice
scalia.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
in
rare
circumstances,
the
facts
of
the
district
court's
involvement
will
justify
the
district
court
judge
making
the
determination.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
well,
i
think--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--i...
because
we
believe
its
discretion...
i
believe
it's
going
to
take
more,
frankly,
for
the
court
to
decide
that
it
will
exercise
its
discretion
than
just
that
it
heard
the
terms.
justice
coyle
has
presided
over
the
3-day
trial.
the
petitioner
comes
in
and
says
they
want
to
talk
settlement.
justice
coyle
then
makes
sure
that
he
and
the
parties,
through
a
negotiation
process,
understand
that.
that
is
a
relatively
unusual
amount
of
activity.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
ancillary
jurisdiction
is
discretionary.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
if
it
wants
to.
and
we
believe
this
is
a
case
where--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--nothing...
we
would
not
complain,
your
honor.
we
would
not
complain.
and
we
believe,
as
i
suggested,
that
the
greater
majority
of
cases,
the
district
court
judge
is
far
more
likely...
because
they
will
not
have
invested
the
federal
judicial
resources
so
deeply
in
the
case,
that
they
will
say--
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
--discretionary.
well,
it's
discretionary,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
morris,
jr.
it's
ancillary
jurisdiction,
and
if
one
looks
at
the
historical
ancillary
precedents,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
court
believes
that
there
is
a
reason
to
step
back
in.
