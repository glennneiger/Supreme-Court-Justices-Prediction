justice

scalia
mr.
jencks,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
how
you
say
the
constitutional
question
can
be
avoided.
it
seems
to
me
if
neither
the
rules
nor
the
statute
provide
for
this
kind
of
jurisdiction,
the
argument
is
still
going
to
be
made,
and
is
made
by
your
adversary
here,
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
the
statute
or
in
the
rules;
that
the
court
has
it
by
virtue
of
the
constitution,
automatically;
there
is
an
inherent
authority
under
the
constitution.
isn't
that
question
in
this
case,
no
matter
what
we
say
about
the
rule--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
we
have
to
consider
that
question,
don't
we,
whether
the
inherent
power
under
the
constitution
covers
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
court
could
say
i
will
not
dismiss
unless
you
agree
to
embody
this
settlement
agreement
in
my
order.
he
has
that
whip
hand.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
adversary
will
acknowledge
that
if
that's
done,
there
would
be...
to
enforce.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that'll
just
get
you
the
lawsuit.
you
don't
want
the
lawsuit,
you
want
the
settlement,
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
the
lawsuit
or
the
settlement?
justice
antonin
scalia
ancillary
to
what?
i
mean
you
can
have
jurisdiction
ancillary
to
a
case
that's
before
you,
but
once
this
case
has
been
dismissed
without
any
reservation
of
continuing
jurisdiction,
there's
nothing
to
be
ancillary
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
has...
no
longer
has
a
case
in
front
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
have
had
a
cause
of
action
in
state
court
as
well,
or
do
you
think
this
was
your
exclusive
remedy?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
this
means
that
a
district
judge
can't
avoid
getting
himself
entangled
in
the
future
disputes
of
a
settlement
agreement,
even
if
he
wants
to.
i
mean
it's
sort
of
nice
to
know
the
district
judge,
if
he
thinks
it's
a
pretty
simple
settlement
that
he
can
police,
just
put
it
in
his
judgment
order.
but
you
say
even
if
he
doesn't,
he
is
enmeshed
in
whatever
the
parties
have
agreed
to,
and
they
can
keep
coming
back
and
bothering
him
about
it
and
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he's
involved...
whenever
he's
involved
in
the
settlement,
which
often
happens.
no,
your
position
is
whenever
the
settlement...
the
terms
of
the
settlement
are
disclosed
in
court
proceedings.
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
proceeding
is
in
chambers
or
in
the
judgment
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
discretionary
jurisdiction?
the
court
doesn't
have
to
exercise
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
ancillary
jurisdiction.
it's
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
if
it
wants
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
except,
maybe
it's
not
ancillary...
yes,
ancillary
jurisdiction,
some
of
it
is
discretionary,
but
if
you
consider
this
inherent
jurisdiction
i
think
it's
a
lot
harder
to
run
that
argument.
thank
you,
mr.
morris.
mr.
jencks,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you
say
that
he
can
go
on
60(b).
but
the
consequence
is
not
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement,
it's
just
to--
--go
back
to
reopen
the
old
case.
right,
to
reopen
the
case.
so
it
is
a
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
kokkonen
versus
guardian
life
insurance
company.
that
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioner,
kokkonen,
brought
a
suit
against
guardian
life
insurance
company
in
state
court
alleging
state
claims
arising
out
of
guardian's
termination
of
him
as
one
of
its
insurance
agents.
guardian
removed
the
case
to
the
federal
district
court
on
diversity
grounds
and
filed
state
law
counterclaims.
the
parties
settled
their
dispute
and,
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
4(a)(1)(ii),
executed
a
stipulation
and
order
of
dismissal
with
prejudice
signed
by
the
district
judge
which
did
not
refer
to
the
settlement
agreement
nor
did
it
reserve
district
court
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement.
afterward,
a
dispute
arouse
as
to
kokkonen's
obligations
under
the
settlement
agreement
and
guardian
filed
a
motion
in
the
federal
district
court
to
enforce
it.
kokkonen
opposed
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
the
court
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
entered
an
enforcement
order
asserting
that
it
had
what
it
called
inherent
power
to
do
so.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
and
affirmed.
in
the
unanimous
opinion
announced
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
federal
district
courts
possess
only
that
power
authorized
by
constitution
and
statute.
no
federal
statute
provides
jurisdiction
to
enforce
a
settlement
agreement
merely
because
that
agreement
is
part
of
the
consideration
for
dismissal
of
a
federal
suit.
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
also
does
not
support
jurisdiction
in
this
settling.
since
the
facts
to
be
determined
with
regard
to
the
alleged
breach
of
contract
are
quite
separate
from
the
facts
that
were
at
issue
in
the
principal
suit.
an
automatic
jurisdiction
over
such
settlement
contracts
is
in
no
way
essential
to
the
conduct
of
federal
court
business.
if
the
parties
wish
to
provide
for
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
enforce
a
settlement
agreement
that
results
in
dismissal,
they
can
seek
to
do
so.
in
the
event
of
dismissal
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
41(a)(2),
the
court
may
in
its
discretion
make
the
parties
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
settlement
agreement
or
retention
of
jurisdiction
over
the
agreement
part
of
its
order.
when
dismissal
occurs
pursuant
to
rule
41(a)(1)(ii),
as
was
the
case
here,
the
district
court
is
empowered
with
the
consent
of
the
parties
to
incorporate
the
settlement
agreements
in
the
order
or
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
settlement
contract
itself.
absent
such
action,
however,
enforcement
of
the
settlement
agreement
is
for
state
courts
unless
there
is
some
independent
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
as
i
indicated
earlier.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
