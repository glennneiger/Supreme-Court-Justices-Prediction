we'll
hear
argument
next
in
93-263,
matt.
t.
kokkonen
v.
the
guardian
life
insurance
company
of
america.
mr.
jencks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
action
wasn't
incorporated.
what
you
mean
is
the
agreement,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
was
not
a
written
agreement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
dictated
into
the
record
some
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
rules,
strictly
speaking,
i
suppose,
can't
confer
jurisdiction.
it's
statutes
that
confer
jurisdiction.
a
rule
could
implement
a
statute.
then
what
you're
saying
here,
i
suppose,
is
that
there's
no
independent
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
judicial
code.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
an
issue--
--well,
mr.
jencks,
you've
been
asked
several
questions
where
it's
been
assumed
that
there
is
a
proper
motion
to
vacate
under
60(b),
but
i
think
you
said
earlier
that
in
this
case
you
didn't
think
there
was
any
basis
on
which
60(b)
could
be
used.
what
would
have
been
the
basis,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
for
a
motion
of
rule
30...
rule
60(b)
motion?
i
take
it
you
don't
think
one
should
have
been
granted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
motion
to
enforce
wouldn't
be
brought
under
rule
60(b).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
but
there
have
been
a
number
of
hypothetical
questions
put
to
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
peculiar
to
this
case.
what
of
the
general
circumstance
of
a
settlement
agreement
not
itself
incorporated
in
the
record,
breached
several
months
later,
the
court
simply
orders
a
dismissal;
is
there
any
basis
for
a
rule
60(b)
motion
on
the
part
of
the
party
that
wishes
to
have
the
federal
court
enforce
the
settlement
agreement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
is
that
there's
no
evidence
of
fraud,
mistake,
or
the
sort
of
other
things
that
60(b)
is
used
for.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jencks.
mr.
morris,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
court
wanted
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
such
a
breach,
for...
a
breach
in
the
future,
it
could
have
done
just
what
justice
scalia
suggests,
incorporate
the
agreement
and
say
we
retain
jurisdiction.
you
wouldn't
have
any
of
this
problem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
understand
the
petitioner
to
be
challenging
the
fact
that
there
was
an
agreement,
so...
or
saying
that
what
appears
in
the
record
was
not
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
i
think
what
the
petitioner
is
challenging
is
the
authority
of
the
court
to
enforce
the
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
you
say:
"we
have
the
constructive
equivalent
of
the
embodiment
of
the
agreement
in
the
order.
"
i
mean
what
does
that
mean
when
stripped
of
the
adjectives.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
would
say
both
of
those
are
their...
one
is
the
equivalent
of
the
other,
inherent
power
or...
is
the
same
as
ancillary
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
surely
there's
a
parole
evidence
rule
of
some
sort
with
respect
to
orders
in
judgment.
you
say
that
it
isn't
in
writing,
but
somehow
it
hovers
around
the
written
word.
i
don't
know
that
we've
ever
said
that
the...
particularly
in
dealing
with
a
jurisdictional
matter,
that
you
look
not
merely
to
what's
written,
but
to
all
the
circumstances
that
kind
of
led
up
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nobody
doubts...
no
one
is
claiming
that
there
was
no
agreement
here.
i...
the
argument
the
other
side
makes
is
since
there
was
no
reservation
of
jurisdiction,
that
it
can't
be
enforced
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
make
any
reference
to
rule
60(b)
in
your
motion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
would
be
a
rather
strange
thing
to
treat
it
as
a
rule
60(b)
motion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
60(b)
is
addressed
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
motion
to
enforce,
i
take
it,
would
not
be.
if
you
have
a
right
to
have
a
settlement
enforced,
it
isn't
up
to
the
trial
judge
to
decide,
well,
i
don't
think
i
will
enforce
this,
or
perhaps
i
will
enforce
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jencks.
the
case
is
submitted.
