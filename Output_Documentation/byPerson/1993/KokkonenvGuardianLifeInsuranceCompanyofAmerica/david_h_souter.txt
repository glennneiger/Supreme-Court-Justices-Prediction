justice
david
h.
souter
but
are
you
not
also
saying
that
there
is
no
juris...
there
would
be
no
jurisdictional
problem
if
a
rule
60
motion
had
been
filed
here
and
the
other
side
had
been...
had
asked
to
be
relieved
from
the
burden
of
the
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
now
if
the
case
had
been
restored
to
the
docket,
would
you
then
take
the
position
that
the
court
could
not
consider
your
settlement
and
that
the
only
thing
the
court
could
do
would
be
to
litigate
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
being
on
a
jurisdictional
basis
or
on
the
text
of
the
rules?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
it
be
available
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
more
would
you
have
needed?
are
there
any
set
of
facts
that
you
can
imagine
in
which
rule
60
could
have
been
invoked
here
properly?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mere
breach
of
settlement
would
never
be
sufficient
under
rule
60?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
having
a
similar
difficulty,
i
guess,
and
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
questions,
which
i
don't
think
i
understood.
is...
i
think
you
said
that
if
we
assume
the
moment
after
the
rule
60
motion
is
granted,
the
prior
judgment,
silent
as
to
any
settlement
and
so
on,
silent
with
respect,
in
fact,
to
anything
except
the
dismissal,
has
been
vacated.
i
think
you
said
that
if
the
parties
then
said,
in
effect,
"look,
judge,
we're
having
trouble
sort
of
administering
our
settlement
and
we
would
like
to
put
that
on
the
record
and
make
that
a
part
of
the
judgment.
"
there
would
be
no
jurisdictional
problem
in
your
view.
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
done
by
consent,
in
other
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
would
be
no
jurisdictional
problem
in
doing
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
why
then
is
there
a
jurisdictional
problem
when
they
don't
consent
to
that
and
one
party
simply
says
we
had
a
settlement;
i
want
to
prove
to
you
what
the
settlement
was;
i
want
you
then
to
embody
that
settlement
in
a
judgment
or
at
least
enforce
it
now?
as
you
said,
they
can't
confer
subject-matter
jurisdiction
by
agreement.
why
do
they
have
jurisdiction
in
the
first
case
and
not
in
the
second
case?
why
does
the
court
have
jurisdiction
in
the
first
case
and
not
in
the
second
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
in
each
case
what
you've
got
is
what
you
describe
here,
at
this
point,
as
a
private
contract.
in
each
of
the
alternatives
the
parties
have
not
previously
brought
it
before
the
court
and
had
it
embodied
in
any
order
of
the
court.
in
the
one
case
they,
in
effect,
are
saying
we'll
find
it
easier
to
live
with
this
if
you
make
it
part
of
your
judgment.
in
the
other
case
one
of
the
parties
says,
no,
i
deny
that
we
had
a
settlement
agreement
of
the
sort
that
is
claimed
here.
in
the
one
case
the
parties
in
effect
consent
to
its
embodiment
in
an
order.
in
the
second
case
one
of
the
party
refuses,
one
of
the
parties
refuses,
and
therefore
if
it's
going
to
be
embodied
in
the
order
or,
indeed,
if
it's
going
to
be
enforced
by
the
court,
it's
going
to
have
to
be
proven.
in
each
case
what
you've
got
at
that
moment
is
what
you
describe
as
a
private
contract.
why
does
the
court
have
jurisdiction,
in
your
view,
to
accede
to
the
parties'
request
in
the
first
case
and
not
have
subject-matter
jurisdiction
in
the
second
case?
doesn't
it
either
have
it
in
both
or
in
neither?
justice
david
h.
souter
just
to
make
sure
i
understand,
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
is
based
on
subject-matter
jurisdictional
grounds.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
what
about
the
fact
that
he
said
i
don't
want
to
see
you
back
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
you
ask
him
to
amend
his
judgment
because
it
failed
to
embody
what
he
had
intended?
you're
giving
us
the
legislative
history
of
the
judgment
here.
why
didn't
you
just
put
it
in
the
judgment?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
of
your
submissions
to
the
court
did
you
claim
that
the
judgment
entered
was,
in
fact,
mistaken
in
failing
to
embody
the
settlement--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
a
result
of
your
conversation...
the
conversation
on
the
record?
