well,
do
you
argue
that
application
of
the
federal
rules
themselves
means
if
you
just
follow
the
rules,
that
there
is
no
right
to
come
in
later
for
enforcement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
wasn't
resorted
to
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
you
just
follow
the
rules,
the
court
had
no
authority
to
enforce
this
judgment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
on
your--
--then
if
that
were
the
case,
we
wouldn't
reach
any
constitutional
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we
can
solve
it
by
just
saying
the
rules
don't
allow
it.
