justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
that
inherent
power
again?
inherent
power
to
do
what,
judge's
inherent,
what
are
we
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
only
order
that's
outstanding
here
is
an
order
dismissing
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
all...
that's
the
only
order
we
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
inherent
power
to
enforce
an
order
of
dismissal
is
what
we're
talking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
i
think
you
just...
you
suggested
earlier
we're
not
talking
about
vacating
a
judgment
and
going
forward
with
the
preceding
lawsuit.
they
are
rather
seeking
to
enforce
a
separate
agreement
that
resulted
in
dismissal
of
the
lawsuit,
and
they're
suing
for
enforcement
of
that
agreement.
that's
quite
a
different
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
still...
i
still
don't
quite
understand
the
concept
of
inherent
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
court's
order
to
dismiss.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you're
not...
that's
not...
you're
arguing
the
other
side.
i'm
not
quite
sure
of
the
scope
of
your
concession,
i
guess
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
mr.
jencks,
doesn't
that
raise
still
another
question?
pursuant
to
such
an
understanding
with
the
judgment
incorporated
in...
i
mean,
with
the
terms
of
the
settlement
agreement
incorporated
in
the
judgment,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judgment
could
do
one
of
two
things.
one,
it
could
say,
as
injunctions
often
do,
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
for
the
purposes
of
enforcement.
or
alternatively,
it
could
just
put
it
in
there,
say
nothing,
and
dismiss
the
case.
now,
if
the
case
is
dismissed
with
just
the
terms
of
the
agreement
printed
in
the
judgment,
would
the
court
have
jurisdiction
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
without
such
a
statement.
if
it
retains
jurisdiction
expressly,
of
course
it's
easily,
like
any...
and
most
decrees
such
a
recital.
but
my
question
is
supposing
there's
no
such
recital
in
the
judgment,
just
a
copy
of
what
the
parties
agreed
to,
and
then
a
judgment
saying
the
judgment
is
dismissed...
the
case
is
dismissed
and
the
parties
shall
go
hence
without
day,
you
know.
this
is
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
and
just
a
recital
of
the
basis
of
the
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
case
is
dismissed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
4
months
later
one
of
the
parties
comes
in
and
says
they're
not
abiding
by
the
settlement,
what
can
the
judge
do?
does
he
have
jurisdiction
just
because
he
put
some
words
in
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
all
that,
and
i
understand
your
difficulty
in
answering.
do
you
have
a
position
on
the
hypothetical
i've
given
you
as
to
whether
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction
if
the
judgment
recited
the
terms
of
a
settlement
and
then
dismissed
the
case
without
an
express
retention
of
jurisdiction
for
purposes
of
interpreting
or
enforcing
the
decree?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
i
hear
your
position,
on
such
a
motion--
--let
me
just
test--
--the
relief
to
be
granted
would
be
to
reinstate
the
lawsuit
and
go
forward
with
that
rather
than
enforcing
the
settlement
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
little
strange.
you
say
you
can
both
rescind
the
agreement
and
sue
for
breach
at
the
same
time.
because
in
order
to
reinstate
the
case
you
have
to
set
aside
the
settlement
and
say
it's
no
longer
binding,
and
then
you're
going
to
say
yes,
but
it's
binding
but
we
want
to
enforce
it.
i
don't...
i
have
some
difficulty
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
only
way
it
can
bring
the
matter
back
is
to
set
aside
the
judgment
and
the
settlement.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
understand
your
argument
is
that
the
transcript
here
is
just
as
clear
as
if
they
had
written
out
a
stipulation
and
filed
it
in
open
court
as
part
of
the
judgment,
but
nevertheless
dismissed
the
lawsuit
and
did
not
retain
jurisdiction.
that's
kind
of...
you're
saying
that's
the
equivalent
of
this
case.
how
long,
under
your
view
of
the
law,
does
the
judge
retain
the
power
to
enforce
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement,
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he...
the
time
limit
is
just
his
sound
discretion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
really
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
your
position
is
it's
whatever
the
judgment...
whatever
the
judge
thinks
is
equitable
or
appropriate
in
the
particular
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rely
on
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
upholding
the
district
court's
authority,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
had...
i'm...
what
is
the
contempt
case
you
have,
where
after
a
case
is
dismissed
a
party
is
held
in
contempt
for
violating--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
are
there
any
cases
in
which
action
taken
after
the
case
is
dismissed
provides
the
basis
for
contempt
of
court?
i
don't
there
are,
are
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
too?
would
it
matter
if
the
settlement
agreement
incorporated
a
term
that
could
not
have
been
granted
by
an...
a
provision
the
court
could
not
have
ordered
as
relief
in
the
case?
for
example,
say
your
client
had
settled
and
said
i'll
move
to
san
francisco
so
i
won't
compete
with
you
any
more,
and
then
he
doesn't
move
to
san
francisco.
a
judge
could...
normally
could
not
have
ordered
him
to
move
to
san
francisco.
he
just...
would
that
make
any
difference?
does
it
have
to
be...
does
the
settlement
agreement
have
to
be
limited
to
matters
that
could
have
been
ordered
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
proper
relief
in
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
argue
in
this
case
everything
that
was
agreed
to
was
something
the
judge
could
have
ordered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
morris,
can
i
give
you
an
example
that's
based
on
many
years
ago
that
i
bumped
into
many
times
in
practice,
and
see
if
you...
have
you
comment.
i
was
involved
in
a
lot
of
cases
where
equitable
relief
was
sought
which
were
settled
at
one
time;
either
government
antitrust
cases,
private
antitrust
cases,
other
cases.
and
routinely,
those
decrees
contained
a
provision,
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
interpreting
and
enforcing
this
decree.
are
you
telling
me
that
in
all
of
those
settlements
that
provision
was
really
unnecessary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it,
of
course,
is
a
classic
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
it
necessary
in
a
government
suit
against
a
couple
of
newspapers,
or
something
like
that?
why
would
they
keep
it
in
if
it's
so
obvious
that
this
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
just
i
have
to
confess
to
you,
a
lot
of
lawyers
thought
it
was
necessary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
was
one
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
telling
me
it
wasn't,
really.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
course,
the
big
difference,
i
suppose,
is
if
you
can
go
back
the
way
you
want
to
go
back
in...
and
maybe
you
should
be
allowed
to...
you're
going
to
get
it
decided
very
promptly.
if
you've
got
to
start
all
over
with
a
new
lawsuit,
you
may
be
3
years
before
you
get
a
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
terms
of
the
settlement
are...
have
to
be
set
forth
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
say
as
a
form
of
federal
jurisdiction,
that
the
judge
can
just
decide
i
don't
want
to
take
the
case?
strange--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--discretionary
jurisdiction.
