justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.
parrish,
if
you
look
at
page
22
on
the
joint
appendix,
the
charge
is:
"that
the
defendant
whose
case
you
are
considering
knew
the
nature
and
character
of
the
items.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
parrish,
the
judge
in
his
charge
three
times
told
the
jury
that
the
defendant
whose
case
the
jury
was
considering
had
to
know
the
nature
and
character
of
the
items.
so
you
say
even
though
that
was
repeated
in
instruction
21,
22,
and
was
it
18?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
that
although
he
repeated
that
the
defendant
must
know
the
nature
and
character
of
the
items,
that
that's
wiped
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
disputing,
are
you,
that
the
government
did
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
the
nature
and
character
of
the
items
that
were
sold
in
her
shop,
that
she
knew
that
they
were
primarily
designed
for
use...
that
their
primary
use
was
in
connection
with
illegal
drugs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
proof
is
what
is
adequate
to
go
to
the
jury,
not
what
the
jury
finds.
was
there
sufficient
proof
for
the
jury
to
find
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
primary
use
of
these
items
was
in
connection
with
illegal
drugs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question...
your
response.
some
of
these
items
were
specifically
enumerated
in
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
o'connor
mentioned
those.
are
you
saying
that
the
government
did
not
prove,
so
that
a
jury
could
not
find
the
defendant
knew
the
primary
use
of
bongs
and
roach
clips
was
in
connection
with
illegal
drugs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
parrish,
are
you
saying
that
if
we
had
no
confusion
in
the
charge
whatever,
the
charge
is
very
clear
that
the
government
must
prove
this
defendant
knew
that
the
primary
use...
not
the
exclusive
use,
the
primary
use
of
this
substance
is
in
connection
with
illegal
drugs,
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional
as
a
construction
of
the
statute?
the
statute...
now
we
have...
we're
eliminating
entirely
the
element
of
confusion.
the
charge
says
jury,
the
requirement
is
that
the
defendant
must
know
that
the
primary
use
of
this
item
is
in
connection
with
unlawful
drugs.
no
confusion,
is
that
permissible,
is
that
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
you
establish
the
knowing
is,
for
one
thing,
you
look
at
the
list
that
justice
kennedy
mentioned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
clear
notice
that
these
items
constitute
drug
paraphernalia,
their
principal
use
is
in
connection
with
unlawful
drugs.
so
you
have
the
statutory
list
and
the
clear
instruction
and
that
would
meet
the
constitutional
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
saying...
that's
what
i
wanted
to
clarify.
you're
not
arguing
that
the
only
constitutional
standard
is
this
subjective
one.
that
is,
that
the
defendant
must
want
the
purchaser
to
use
it
in
connection
with
drugs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
that
there
can
be
a
knowledge
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
were
candid
in
acknowledging
in
your
brief
that
the
formulas
used
by
the
circuits
were
not
entirely
satisfactory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
this
charge
wasn't
entirely
satisfactory.
if
you
were
to
put
in
words
what
the
proper
charge
should
be
to
convey
your
understanding
of
the
state
of
mind
requirement
to
convict,
what
would
that...
what
would
those
words
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bryson,
it
was
my
understanding
that
in
the
revision
the
word
"scheme"
was
dropped.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
don't
want
to...
even
though
it
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
it
seems
by
putting
any
heavy
weight
on
that
you're
making
this
an
extremely
narrow
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
parrish,
i
just
want
to
confirm
my
understanding
of
what
you
just
said.
mr.
bryson
told
us
that
his
model
charge
would
be
that
it
must
be
drug
paraphernalia
as
defined
in
subsection
(d),
that's
(1).
and
that
the
defendant
must
know
that
the
goods
are
primarily
used...
not
necessarily
this
customer,
but
primarily
used
with
drugs,
period.
if
that's
what
had
been
said,
as
simple
as
that,
the
defendant
must
know
these
goods
are
primarily
used
with
drugs,
you
would
have
no
objection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know
that's
your...
your
view
is
that
that
confuses
things,
but
i
just
wanted
to
know
that
you
are
in
agreement
with
mr.
bryson
that
the
model
charge
would
be
that
the
defendant
knows
the
goods
are
primarily
used
with
drugs.
