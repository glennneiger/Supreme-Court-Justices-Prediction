justice
antonin
scalia
they
can...
even
though
they
have
dual
purpose,
they
can
still
be
drug
paraphernalia,
can't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
didn't
the
instruction
require
that
the
defendant
know
the
nature
of
these
items?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
assuming
that
that
is
the
intent
provision
of
the
statute,
but
that
is
not
the
intent
provision
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
the
intent
in
the
design
that's
crucial,
it's
the
intent
in
the
sale
that's
crucial.
that's
the
mens
rea
that
you
insist
upon--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
the
mens
rea
of
the
designer,
but
of
the
seller.
and
don't
the
instructions
clearly
require
that
the
seller
know
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
items?
justice
antonin
scalia
dual
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
the
instructions
clearly
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
have
to
find,
one,
that
the
items
in
question
constitute
drug
paraphernalia;
two,
that
the
defendant,
whose
case
you
are
considering,
the
seller
here,
knew
the
nature
and
character
of
the
items.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
be
much
clearer
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
39
relates
to
something
else,
to
the
designer,
and
that's
not
the
intent
we're
concerned
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
there
is
under
this
statute.
not
just
that
there
can
constitutionally
be,
but
you
acknowledge
that
that
would
be
enough
knowledge
under
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
get
into
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
agree
that
if
it
had
been
made
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
had
been
made
clear
that
all
this
seller
has
to
know
is
that
these
are
drug
paraphernalia...
which
is
to
say
they
are
primarily
intended
primarily
for
uses
as
drug
paraphernalia,
even
though
they
may
have
other
uses.
if
that
had
been
made
clear,
that
would
comply
with
the
constitution
and
with
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
to
cut
to
the
chase
here,
what
is
the
government's
position
as
to
the
nature
of
the
scienter?
is
it
that
the
defendant
must
know
either
that
the
item
was
designed
for
that
purpose
or
that
the
item
was
intended
for
that
purpose
by
the
manufacturer?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
the
intended
provision--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
okay,
someone--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
has
to
know
somebody
else's
state
of
mind,
essentially.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't
say
use,
is
says
designed...
designed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
design
something
for
a
purpose
if
it's
your
intent
to
make
them
for
that
purpose,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
nobody
designed
it
for
that
purpose?
i
mean
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
you
can
say
it
seems
to
be
designed
for
that
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
know
how
you
can
avoid
that.
from
the
language,
i
don't
know
how
you
can...
i
don't
know
that
it's
such
a
terrible
thing,
either.
i
mean,
why
is
it
so
hard
to
tell
whether
it
was,
you
know,
designed
for
that
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
it's
hard
to
tell
whether
a
car
was
designed
for
transportation
without
talking
to
the
fellow
who
built
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what...
obviously
it
has
to
relate
to
the
intent
of
some
particular
person
or
persons.
you
don't
have
an
intent
just
floating
around
in
the
air,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
i
mean,
it
could
be
the
intent
of
the
seller,
it
could
be
the
intent
of
the
manufacturer.
it
has
to
be
the
intent
of
some
person,
but
no
particular
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
meaning
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
jury
understood
it
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
give
us
the
last
couple
and
then
i
have
a
question
for
you.
just
tell
us
quickly
where
they
are
so
i
can
mark
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that,
which
instruction?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
this
may
be
just
repeating
what
justice
stevens
was
asking,
but
i
take
it
it
is
your
position
that
the
statute
is
covered
if
all
that
the
seller
knows
is
that
the
individual
to
whom
he's
selling
the
dual-purpose
item
in
fact
intends
to
use
it
for
one
of
the
prohibited
purposes?
so
that
if...
you
know,
if
i'm
a
clerk
in
a
drug
store
and
i
have
a
friend
who
i
know
is
a
drug
addict
and
he
comes
in...
and
i
know
that
he
doesn't
use
this
type
of
razor
when
he
shaves,
and
he
comes
in
and
asks
for
a
pack
of
razors
and
i
just
give
him
a
pack
over
the
counter.
i
know
very
well
what
he's
going
to
use
them
for.
that
would
violate
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
why
we
have
prosecutorial
discretion,
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said...
i
thought
you
agreed
with
the
instruction
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
intent
of
any
particular
person.
it
seems
to
me
it
can
be
the
manufacturer's
intent,
it
can
be
the
seller's
intent,
it
can
be
the
purchaser's
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
if
i
come...
that's
why
you
had
trouble
with
my
hypothetical.
i
come
up
to
somebody
who's
just
a
druggist
and
i
say
sell
me
a...
sell
me
some
razor
blades
because
i
want
to
use
it
to
cut
drugs.
and
that
would
be
the
necessary
intent,
wouldn't
it,
on
the
part
of
the
purchaser?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
intent,
mr.
parrish?
[laughter]
