the
cases,
which
have
been
around
here
a
while,
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
petitioners
were
convicted
on
a
number
of
charges
under
a
statute
known
as
21
u.s.c.
section
857.
these
included
the
use
of
an
interstate
conveyance
as
part
of
the
scheme
to
sell
drug
paraphernalia.
in
searching,
petitioner
acty's
residence
and
her
business
premissest,
the
officers
seize
a
number
of
drug
related
items.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
of
conviction.
it
held
that
the
statute
requires
proof
of
scienter
and
that
the
act
is
not
unconstitutionally
vague.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
also
affirm.
the
statute
merely
establishes
objective
scienter
requirements
for
determining
what
constitutes
drug
paraphernalia.
the
statue
properly
construed.
it
requires
the
government
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knowingly
made
use
of
an
interstate
conveyance
as
part
of
a
scheme
to
sell
items
that
he
knew
were
likely
to
be
used
with
illegal
drugs.
it
need
not
prove
specific
knowledge
about
the
dorms
that
the
items
are
drug
paraphernalia.
also,
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutionally
vague
as
applied
to
the
petitioners.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
is
joined
therein
by
justice
kennedy
and
justice
thomas.
