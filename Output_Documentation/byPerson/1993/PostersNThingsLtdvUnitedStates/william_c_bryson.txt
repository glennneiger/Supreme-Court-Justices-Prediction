mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
great
deal
of
the
discussion
this
morning
has
been
over
the
instructions.
and
while
i
recognize
that
isn't
the
principal
issue
that
the
court
has
before
it,
i
would
very
briefly,
just
as
a
predicate
to
my
argument,
like
to
review
the
portions
of
the
instructions
that
did
specifically
address
the
question.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
the...
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
we
certainly
changed
our
approach
to
the
case
in
this
respect,
in
that
in
the
lower
courts
the
thrust
of
the
argument
being
made
by
the
defendants
was
that
a
subjective
intent
was
required.
that
is...
and
this
was
the
basis
for
the
objections
that
were
made
in
the
district
court...
that
the
defendant
herself
had
to
have
designed
or
intended
the
drug
use.
and
we
said
that
was
not
so,
and
the
district
judge
agreed
with
us.
so
the
question
of
where
the
intent,
where
the
knowledge
lay,
and
so
forth,
was
really
not
the
focus
of
the
district
court
proceeding.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
argument
was
made...
the
principal
argument
made
by
the
defendants
was
that
this
statute
has
no
scienter
requirement
at
all
and
therefore
is
unconstitutional.
so,
again,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
they
did
not
argue
for
a
particular
scienter
requirement.
they
didn't
press
the
issue
of
knowledge.
they
were
looking
for
a
constitutional
ruling
based
on
an
assumption
of
no
scienter.
so
we
are
addressing
the
case
as
it
now
comes
to
the
court,
and
addressing
in
particular
the
question
that's
raised
in
the
petition.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they
did.
that
was
their
backup
argument.
but,
again,
the
instruction
they
were
talking
about
was
the
instruction
that
they'd
argued
for
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
which
was
the
purely
subjective
intent
instruction.
which
is
the...
again,
the...
this
defendant
has
to
have
designed,
or
this
defendant
has
to
have
intended
that
the
drugs
be
used,
not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
certainly.
well,
let
me
address
it
right
now.
i
think
that
the
instructions
can
be
different
because
i
think
designed
and
intended
are
different
terms.
designed,
i
think,
is
a
much
simpler
concept.
that
simply
means
that
the
manufacturer
made
the
thing
in
a
way
that
makes
it
suitable
only
for
a
particular
use,
absent
some
kind
of
very
bizarre
use.
intended
for
obviously
is
a
more
complicated
concept.
but
in
both
cases
the
idea
of
scienter
would
be
the
same,
we
submit,
which
is
that
the
defendant
has
to
know
the
primary
use
of
the
substance
is
for
drugs.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
we
think
the
listed
items
are...
with
exception
perhaps.
but
we
think
that
basically
the
listed
items
are
all
design
items.
i
mean
the
one
exception
is
there's
a
reference
to
roach
clips,
which
are
items
which,
by
virtue
of
the
way
they're
intended,
the
way
they're
marketed
and
so
forth,
would
be
either
drug
paraphernalia
or
not
drug
paraphernalia.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they
say...
that's
right.
but
it's--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
clear.
but
i
think
it
would
be
our
position
that
each
of
those
items
is,
in
fact,
an
item
that
is
designed,
because
they
are
specifically
identified
because
they
have
exclusively
drug
purposes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
and
what
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
not
necessarily
intended
by
the
manufacturer,
but
intended
by
the
retailer--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--or
someone
in
the
chain
of
distribution
who
may
use
it.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
who
may
display
it
in
a
particular
way.
in
other
words,
that
you
may
have
a
manufacturer
making
something.
again,
let's
take
roach
clips.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
which
may
not
by
their
design
necessarily
commit
themselves
to
drug
use.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but...
excuse
me.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
isn't
a
state
of
mind.
he
has
to
know
what
the
goods
are
used
for,
what
they--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
and
designed,
i
think,
means--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that
is
true.
but
the...
an
item
can
be
designed
for
a
purpose...
you
can
objectively
view
an
item
and
say
this
item
is
designed...
a
car
is
designed
for
transportation.
now,
it
is
true
that
somebody
back
at
the
plant--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
somebody
obviously--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--somebody
obviously
will
design
it
for
that
purpose.
but
what
you're
really
concerned
with,
and
what
this
statute
is
designed
or
intended
to
reach
is
identification
of
an
item.
it
isn't
intended
to...
a
drug
paraphernalia
definition
is
not
intended
to
reach
a
question
of
somebody
else's
intent,
or
for
that
matter
the
defendant's
intent.
it's
intended
to
identify
something
about
the
item.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
what--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
it
isn't
hard
to
tell.
and
if
you
would...
if
you
like,
you
can
say
well,
yes,
we're
looking
at
the
question
of
the
intent
of
the
designer
or
the
intent
of
the
retailer.
but
i
think
what...
when
a
jury
looks
at
this
and
they're
told
you
are
to
try
to
ascertain
what
the
design
or
intent
of
the...
the
intended
use
of
this
good
is.
they
can
look
at
the
good,
they
can
look
at
the
setting,
they
can
look
at
the
retail
display
of
the
good,
and
they
can
make
a
determination
that
that
good
is
committed
to...
intended
to
be
committed
to
use
with
drugs.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
excuse
me.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
uh-hum.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
standard
would
be
if
in
the
setting
in
which
this
particular
item
is
being
marketed
it
appears
that
it
was
intended
to
be
used
with
drugs.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
goes
to
exactly
that
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
typically
it
will
be
the
retailer
in
a
dual-use
item,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
in
other
words,
your
wholesaler
could
package...
and
this
is
exactly
a
case
that's
presented
by
this
case.
the
wholesaler
packages
a
little
item
called
a
cocaine
executive
kit
which
contains,
among
other
things,
a
razor
blade.
now,
when
the
wholesaler
puts
that
kit
together
it
contains
a
razor
blade,
a
vial
with
a
little
spoon
on
it,
and
a
mirror
and
a
straw
and
a
grinder.
this
little
kit,
when
the
retailer...
when
the
wholesaler
sends
it
to
the
retailer,
has
a
razor
blade
in
it
which
is
surely
intended
for
use
with
cocaine.
now,
it
wasn't
designed
that
way.
it
may
have
been
made
by
gillette
and
wholesaler
may
have
put
it
into
the
kit
and
converted
it
into
something
which
is
intended
for
use
with
cocaine.
now,
the
retailer
may
do
nothing
other
than
put
it
down
on
the
counter,
and
therefore
the
retailer
may
not
have
either
designed
it
or
even
specifically
intended
to
create
an
item
that
is
directed
to
this
market.
but
the
retailer,
we
submit,
has
to
know
that
this
kit
is
being
used
for...
primarily
with
drugs,
and
that
satisfies
the
scienter
requirement.
now,
let
me
turn--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that
instruction
is
intended
to
answer
the
suggestion
that
the
defendant
has
to
be
person
who
primarily
intends
that
drugs
be
used
with
this
product,
or
primarily
has
designed
the
product.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
instruction
39,
we
could
have
done
without
instruction
39.
instruction
39
is
really--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
it...
in
determining
what
is
drug
paraphernalia,
you
look
at
the
item.
and
the
question
of
whether
it
happens
to
have
been
the
druggist
or
it
happens
to
have
been
the
wholesaler
or
somebody
else
that
put
the
item
together
and
converted
it
into
something
that
really
one
can
judge
objectively
is
intended
for
drug
use,
or
is
likely
to
be
used
with
drugs,
it's
irrelevant
whether
that
was
the
intent
of
the
druggist
or
any
particular
person.
and
that's
the
language
of
the
instruction.
you
don't...
you're
not
concerned
to
say
did
the
druggist
intend
to
put
this
item
together,
intend
to
try
to
market
it
in
this
particular
way,
as
long
as
you
have
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
that
that
is
what
the
item
is,
that
the
item
is
being
primarily
used
with
drugs.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
in
the
knowledge--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well
i
think
you
have
to...
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
that's
the
gist
of
it.
and
in
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
so.
because
the
jury
was
fully
apprised
of
the
fact
that
the
goods
had
to
be
designed
or
intended
for
use
with
drugs,
and
that
the
defendant
had
to
know
that,
had
to
know
of
the
nature
and
character
and
use
of
the
goods.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
defendant
must
know
that
the
goods
are...
the
goods
in
question
are
primarily
used
with
drugs.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
that
the
drugs
must
also
be
drug
paraphernalia,
as
defined
in
section
(d).
i
think
that's
the
most
efficient
way
to
express
the
thought.
one
might
be
able
to
be
more
precise
about
it,
but
i
think
that
that
is
the
formula
that
would
be
most
readily
understood
by
a
jury
and
would
capture
the
essence
of
what
the
mens
rea
requirements
are.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
the
hardest
case
that's
presented
by
the
statute,
because
what
you
have
there
is
an
item
that
hasn't...
or
a
series
of
items.
let's
just
suppose,
to
make
it
even
harder--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--okay,
i'll
stick
with
yours.
it
is...
i
think
it's
a
very
hard
case
because,
yes,
when
you
put
all
the
items
together
the...
presumably...
well,
let's...
let's
assume
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
seller.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
customer
tells
him.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
by
the
time
you
get
to
that
point,
the
salesman
knows
that
he
is
selling
something
which,
in
the
aggregate,
is
intended
to
be
used
with
drugs.
so
i
would
say
i
think
that
would
satisfy
the
statute.
on
the
other
hand,
it
doesn't
fit
within
the...
what
is
ordinarily
understood
under
the
statute
to
be
something
which
is
designed
or
intended
for
drug
use,
because
it
was
not
until
he
got
to
the
counter--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
it
became
something
that
was
intended
for
drug
use.
so
it
was
very
late
in
the
day
that
it
became
narcotics
paraphernalia,
when
he
walked
up
to
the
counter
and
had
them
all
together
or
when
he
explained
what
the
use
was
that
he
was
going
to
make
of
them.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
i
would
say...
and
you
could
take
an
example
that...
if
i
could
just--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--change
the
hypothetical.
but
my
answer
to
you
is
i
think
that
would
qualify.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
it's
close
to
the
line.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
there
is
some
fuzziness
at
the
edge,
i
think,
in
the
statute.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
but
there's
been,
of
course,
a
lot
of
concern
expressed
about
the
instructions,
and
i
would
like
to
reassure
the
court--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
correct.
it's
not
our
position
that
that
ought
to
be
the
court's
principal
concern.
but
it
is
also
our
position
that
these
instructions
are
adequate
under
the
government's
theory
of
this
case.
and,
now,
let
me
go
through
the
instructions
to
try
to
explain
why
it
seems
to
me
that
these
instructions
do
satisfy
the
mens
rea
requirement,
which
we
find
in
section
857(a)
of
the
statute.
and
there
are
really
not
just
three,
but
i
think
five
different
places
in
the
instructions
that
the
reference
to
nature
and
character
or
nature
and
character
and
use...
nature,
character,
and
use
of
the
goods
is
explained
as
the
basis
for
the
knowledge
requirement.
first
in
instruction
17,
where
the
court
is
describing
the
use
of
a
particular
item.
the
court...
the
use
of,
excuse
me,
particular
evidence
in
the
case.
the
court
explains
that
knowledge
refers...
knowledge
is
a
necessary
element,
that
you
must
find
with
respect
to
each
of
the
charge
offenses
that
knowledge
has
been
proved
as
to
each
defendant
during
the
time
periods,
and
that
knowledge...
and
then
the
court
explains,
and
this
is
at
joint
appendix
18...
refers
to
the
"nature,
character,
and
use
of
the
items
being
sold
or
offered
for
sale
at
the
store.
"
again,
instruction
18,
where
the
court
is
discussing
the
evidence
which
has
been
offered
on
the
good
faith
defense,
the
court
says
that
you
can
consider
the
good
faith
if
it's
"inconsistent
with
the
elements
in
the
charges
of
the
indictment
concerning
the
alleged
knowledge
of
the
defendants
as
to
the
nature,
character,
and
use
of
the
items
being
sold
or
offered
for
sale
at
the
store.
"
that's
at
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix.
then
in
the
two
instructions
on
counts
20...
excuse
me,
on
counts
1
and
2
at
pages
21
and
22
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
court
not
only
instructs
that
the
defendant
whose
case
you
are
considering
must
know
the
nature
and
character
of
the
items,
but
also
adds
that
there
must
be
proof
that
the
use
of
the
interstate
conveyance
was,
quote,
part
of
a
scheme
to
sell
drug
paraphernalia.
now,
we
think
that
the
term
857(a),
but
also
in
informing
the
jury
that
this
is
something
that
they
had
to
know
was--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
we
don't
think
the
existence
of
the
word
857...
the
prior
statute
is
critical,
but
we
think
it's
illuminating,
particularly
because
there's
no
indication
that
when
the
1990
change
was
made
in
the
statute
and
the
word
(a),
that
there
was
any...
there's
no
indication
there
was
any
intention
to
remove
a
mens
rea
requirement.
so
what
we
make
of
the
word
857(a)
is
that
it
reflects
a
congressional
understanding
that
there
would
be
a
knowledge
requirement,
that
there
would
be
awareness
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
that
the
defendant
was
doing
something
unlawful,
and
that
there
was
no
indication
in
1990
that
that
fundamental
change...
excuse
me...
change
in
the
statute
was
intended.
so,
yes,
we
don't
put
principal
weight
on
the
word
"scheme",
but
we
certainly
think
it's
illuminating
in
telling
us
what
congress
had
in
mind.
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
here
with
what
amounts
to
a
presumption
in
the
construction
of
federal
statutes
that
you
find
mens
rea
unless
there's
some
clear
indication
to
the
contrary,
or
unless
you're
in
an
area
involving
particular
kinds
of
products.
now,
in
this
area
we
think
that
assumption,
that
rule
of
construction
applies.
and
the
word
"scheme"
is
a
further
indication
that
that
rule
is
applicable
here.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
we
make
the
concession
because
we
think
that...
i
would
say
it's
the
first,
principally,
of
your...
of
the
two
options.
we
think
that
if
you
read
the
court's
cases
such
as
gypsum,
bailey,
liparota,
and
morissette,
what
you
find
is
there
is
this
canon
of
construction.
and
in
a
sense
it's
just
like
the
rule
that
this
court
has
recognized,
that
you
read
into
federal
statutes
the
defense
of
entrapment.
there's
no
statutory
defense
of
entrapment,
but
we
understand
congress
to
legislate
against
a
background
in
which
federal
criminal
statutes
all
have,
unless
otherwise
negated,
a
defense
of
entrapment
or
duress
or
necessity.
this
is
just
one
of
the
ingredients
that
is
assumed
to
be
present
in
federal
statutes,
unless
the
statute
falls
into
one
of
those
rare
cases
in
which
it
can
be
either
assumed
that
there
is
no
such
requirement
or
in
which
congress
indicates
to
the
contrary.
now,
one
of
the
reasons
for
that,
of
course,
is
that
there
are
constitutional
concerns
with
statutes
that
have
absolutely
no
mens
rea
except
where
certain
kinds
of
items
are
at
issue,
and
the
international
minerals
case
discusses
that
concern.
but
i
think
the
basic
point
is...
and
my
basic
answer
to
you
is
it's
the
rule
of
construction.
now,
if
i
can
just
very
quickly
get
back
to
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--okay.
the
last
one
is
really...
is
the
least,
also,
which
is
that
in
the
course
of
the
monetary
crimes
instruction
on
money
laundering,
the
court
instructed
that
the
defendant
had
to
know
that
the
money...
the
monetary
instruments
represented
the
proceeds
of
an
unlawful
activity.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
on
page
28
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
that
the
defendant
intended
the
financial
transactions
to
promote
the
sale
of
drug
paraphernalia.
again,
clearly
indicating
to
the
jury...
and
the
jury
convicted
on
the
count.
clearly
the
jury
concluded
that
the
defendant
did
know
that
these
defendants...
the
defendant
did
know
that
these
items
were
drug
paraphernalia.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
i
have
to
give
you
the
same
answer
i
gave
to
justice
stevens.
both
that
i
think
that
is
right
at
the
edge
of
what
the
statute
covers
and
that,
yes,
i
think
it
probably
would
cover
that.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i'm
always
worried
to
give
the
answer
trust
us,
we
won't
prosecute
those
kinds
of
cases,
because
i
find
that
those
cases
show
up
in
my
office
when
i
get
back.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
might
not,
your
honor.
but
my
argument...
my
analysis
of
that
point
would
be
as
follows,
that
if
you
have
a
primary
use
for
razor
blades,
being
to
use
them
to
shave
as
you
obviously
do,
but
in
your
particular
store
you
put
a
display
out
on
the
counter
which
says
these
razor
blades
are
really
well
suited
for
cocaine
use...
let's
just
make
it
easy.
and
there's...
let's
assume
there
isn't
even
anything
all
that
special
about
these,
but
you've
advertised
them
for
cocaine
use
and
you
say
these
are
great
cocaine
razors,
and
you
put
a
little
picture
on
them,
on
the
display
to
indicate
that
that's
what
they're
intended
for,
then
i
think
you
have
defined
a
little
subgroup
of
the
market
of
razor
blades--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
actually,
i
think
there
would
be,
your
honor.
because
what
you
would
be
doing...
i
would
be
doing
as
a
clerk
is
that
i
would
be
selling
something
which
is
intended
for...
primarily
intended
for
use
with
cocaine--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--to
somebody
who
just
happens
not
to
have
intended
to
use
it
for
that
purpose.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
that
doesn't
exonerate
me.
and
let
me
give
you
the
example
that
seems
to
me
to
demonstrate
that.
suppose
you're
an
undercover
officer
and
you
come
in...
and
i
know
you're
not
going
to
use
this
for
drug
purposes,
i
happen
to
know
you're
an
undercover
officer.
if
i
sell
you
a
bong
or
even
something
that
i've
advertised
as
a
roach
clip,
i'm
guilty
even
though
you
personally
may
not
be
intending
to
use
it
for
that
purpose.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
no,
your
honor.
it's
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
that's
correct.
that,
in
other
words,
the
intent
may
be
reflected
in
the
way
the
product
is
marketed.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
argument
you
would
have
to
make
to
bring
that
example
within
the
coverage
of
the
statute,
i
think,
is
that
the
good
becomes
intended
to
be
used
with
drugs
at
the
point
at
which
you
walk
in,
pick
it
up,
and
announce
that
you
intend
to
use
it
for
that
purpose.
i
think
that's
stretching
what
the
statute
was
designed
to
reach,
but
i
think
it
does
come
within
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
