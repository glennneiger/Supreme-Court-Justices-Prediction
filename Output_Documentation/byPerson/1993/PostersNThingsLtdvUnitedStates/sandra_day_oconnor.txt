justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
parrish,
i...
the
statute
seems
to
speak
in
terms
of
drug
paraphernalia,
and
that
term
is
defined
as
items
either
designed
for
or
intended
for
us
in
connection
with
drug
use.
now,
is
it
not
possible
that
the
statute
makes
unlawful
the
sale
of
certain
items
that
are
designed
for
drug
use
and
that
have
little
other
purpose?
and
if
they're
designed
for
that
and
someone
knows
what
the
object
is,
as
the
instructions
require,
that
that's
sufficient.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
there
were
an
array
of
items
here,
some
of
them
being
such
things
as
are
defined
by
the
statute
itself
as
being
designed
for
drug
use.
i
don't
know
the
names
for
all
these
things,
but
bongs
and
other
items
that
apparently
have
little
other
purpose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
may
have
two
separate
categories
of
items
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
far
as
items
designed
for
use
as
drug
paraphernalia
is
concerned,
how
are
the
instructions
deficient?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
if
the
item
is
designed
for
that
use
and
no
other
and
the
statute
says
if
you
sell
such
items
you're
guilty
of
this
offense,
why
isn't
that
sufficient?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
i'm
not
going
to
belabor
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
types
of
items.
some
are
not
dual
purpose
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
some
are.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bryson.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
suppose
the
items
are
something
like
razor
blades.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
they're
not
on
the
list
of
things
that
apparently
are
to
be
considered
design
for
use
as
drug
paraphernalia.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
proper
standard
in
instruction,
then,
for
the
jury
for
a
retailer
of
razor
blades?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yeah,
i
mean
should...
is
it...
must
the
jury
be
told
and
is
the
standard
that
the
retailer
must
intend
that
they
be
used
for
drug
use?
