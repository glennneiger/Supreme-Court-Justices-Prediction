justice
david
h.
souter
you
take
the
position
that
the
instructions
didn't
require
proof
of
any
mental
element.
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
of
the
charge
that
the
jury
must
find
that
the
government
had
proven
that
the
defendants
understood
they...
or
knew
the
nature
and
character
of
the
items?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
he
didn't
give
the...
excuse
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
he
didn't
give
the
instruction
that
the
government
says
he
gave?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that
is
correct
do
you
lose
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
saying
if
that
was
a
correct
statement
of
law,
do
you
lose?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
primarily
intended
does
not
go
to
the
state
of
mind
of
the
seller
who
was,
in
fact,
the
defendant
or
the
defendants
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
you
had
just
told
me
that
the
judge's
instruction
was
that
the
so-called
element
of
primarily
intended
for
use
was
not
a...
was
not
meant
to
refer
to
the
state
of
mind
of
the
seller
of
the
paraphernalia.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
defendant,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
petitioners
were
sellers.
justice
david
h.
souter
corporate
individuals.
if
that
statement,
contrary
to
what
you
say,
is
correct,
that
primarily
intended
does
not
go
to
the
state
of
mind
of
the
seller,
do
you
lose
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
win
if
you
are
incorrect
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let
me
approach
it
from
a
different
direction.
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
government
must
prove
that
the
seller
in
this
case
primarily
intended
the
items
sold
to
be
used
in
the
manufacture
and/or
ingestion
of
drugs.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
you're
wrong
on
that,
do
you
lose
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
don't
deny,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
do
you,
that
on
three
separate
occasions
the
judge
gave
this
understanding
of
nature
and
character
instruction?
you
don't
deny
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
that
your
argument
is,
i
take
it,
that
the
jury
instruction
was
confusing
and
that
even
though
there
was
a
mens
rea
element
required,
in
the
context
of
the
whole
instruction
the
jury
wouldn't
have
understood
it.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
then
are...
and
i
didn't
get
this
from
your
brief,
but
are
you
arguing
that
instead
of
knowledge,
which
the
government
concedes
must...
knowledge
in
the
sense
the
government
described
it
must
be
proven,
that
this
must
be
a
purposeful
crime?
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
go
ahead.
it's
really
not
very
accurately
put.
i
mean,
you
have
to
read
it
as
does
not
relate
to
the
knowledge
of
any
particular...
you
really
have
to
jump
on
particular.
you
wouldn't
have
framed
it
that
way,
mr.
bryson,
i'm
sure,
if
you
were...
if
you
had
written
it
to
begin
with.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
don't
want
us
to
decide
this
case
based
on
the
instructions,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
we
take
this
case
to
decide
what
element
the
statute
requires?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
didn't
take
this
case
to
review
the
instructions.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
look,
i'm
one
of
the...
i'm
one
of
the
culprits
and
i
recognize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
i
mean,
when
it
comes
down
to
deciding
the
case
and
writing
the
opinion,
it's
not
the
government's
position
that
we
ought
to
affirm
on
the
basis
of
the
instructions.
i
take
it
we
can
assume
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
i
come
in
and
say
i'm
sure
they
are,
indeed,
suitable
for
that
purpose,
but
i
want
to
be
clean
shaven,
please
sell
me
a
package,
there's
no
violation
of
the
statute
in
that
sale,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
intended
by
whom?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
by
me,
not
by
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
then,
your...
and
i...
this
is
implicit
in
what
you
said
before...
your
reference
to
the...
to
the
intent
in
primarily
intended
must
be
primarily
intended
by
the
customer
to
whom
you
address
your
offer.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
to
the
class
of
customers
to
whom
you
address
your
offer.
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-hum.
