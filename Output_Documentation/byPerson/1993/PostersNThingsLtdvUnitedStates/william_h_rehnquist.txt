chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
92-903,
posters
'n'
things,
limited
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
parrish.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
that
latter
proposition,
mr.
parrish?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
it's
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
if
there's
no
mens
rea
requirement
it's
unconstitutional,
and
i
asked
you
what
your
authority
is
for
that
proposition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
reread
the
morissette
case
because
you
cite
it
in
your
brief,
and
i
didn't
read
that
as
saying
anything
about
a
lack
of
intent
making
a
statute
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
get
you
to
any
constitutional
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
your
principal...
the
principal
authority
on
which
you
rely
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
statute
does
not
have
an
intent
requirement,
it
is
unconstitutional,
is
morissette.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
referring
to
this
court
or
other
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
well,
mr.
parrish,
none
of
the
four
questions
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
deal
with
the
instructions
given
by
the
trial
court.
we
don't
ordinarily
sit
here
to
debate
whether
a
particular
instruction
was
confusing
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what's...
under
what
question
is
that
question
presented,
is
that
subsumed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--your
question
two
deals
with
the
standard
imposed
by
the
statute,
not
what
instruction
was
given.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suggest
that
you
don't
devote
any
more
of
your
argument
to
the
particular
instructions
given
in
this
case,
because
i
don't
think...
and
i
think
that
probably
the
bench
agrees
with
me,
that
that's
fairly
raised
in
the
petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
parrish.
mr.
bryson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
parrish,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
parrish.
the
case
is
submitted.
