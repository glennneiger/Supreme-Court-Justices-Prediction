mr.
alfredo
parrish
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
here
today
discussing
21
u.s.c.
857,
which
is
referred
to
and
i
will
refer
to
it
as
the
drug
paraphernalia
statute.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
contains
a
subjective
scienter,
and
when
the
trial
judge
applied
857
without
a
subjective
scienter
in
his
instructions
37
and
39,
did
he
deny
the
petitioner
her
due
process
rights?
the
court,
we
believe,
erroneously
applied
857,
because
when
it
instructed
the
jury
it
instructed
the
jury
without
any
intent
requirement.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
statute
does
not
contain
any
intent
requirement,
as
the
trial
judge
found
and
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed,
then
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
the
conviction
cannot
stand.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that
is
cannot
stand?
mr.
alfredo
parrish
if
it's
un...
it's
based
upon
the
concept
that
a
mens
rea
requirement
is
read
into
a
statute.
if
it's
not
read
into
a
statute,
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
to
try
to
find
it.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
the
authority
that
we
have
for
that
proposition
is
the
morissette
v....
the
morissette
case
is
what
we
use
for
that.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well,
the
morissette
case
dealt
with
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
you
should
look
to
other
instances
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
statute
should
be
declared
unconstitutional.
if
no
mens
rea
statute
is
in
it,
if
no
mens
rea
requirement
is
in
it,
then
we
believe
you
have
to
look
at
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
we
don't
believe
you
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
proposition
in
order
to
remand
this
case
to
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
the
morissette
case.
also
it
seems
to
be
indicated
in
the
hoffman's
estates
case
also,
because
in
that
decision
the
court
indicates
that...
in
their
questioning
to
counsel
and
also
in
the
decision,
that
some
intent
must
be
found
in
the
statute
to
save
its
vagueness.
so
we
talk
about
that
over
and
over
again
in
the
line
of
cases
that
follow
the
hoffman
estates
case.
you
look
for
some
intent.
however,
those
were
preenforcement
cases
and
in
preenforcement
challenges
to
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
the
court
seems
to
save
it
solely
because
there
is
some
intent
requirement
in
the
statute.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
this
court.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well,
in
their
approach
on
that
issue,
that's
not
the
case
that
was
tried
by
the
district
court
judge.
the
judge
tried
a
purely
objective--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
he
did
not
give
the
exact
instruction.
i
will
refer
you
to
page
19
of--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--then
you
go
to
instruction
on
page
31
of
the
joint
appendix,
to
instruction
39,
where
the
term
"primarily
intended"...
which
is
the
vehicle
that
most
of
the
courts
have
used
to
determine
where
the
intent
is
in
this
case...
as
used
in
these
instructions
does
not
relate--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--to
the
knowledge
of
the--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
it
is
a
mens
rea
component.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
but
that's
the
flaw
in
the
instruction.
the
jury
was
never
given
an
opportunity
to
determine
the
primary
intent
of
the
person
who
was,
in
fact,
selling
the
item,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
jury
could
have
gone
back
and
deliberated
anything.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
it's
not
sufficient
because
these
statutes
have...
these
items
have
dual
purposes.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well,
designed
for
use
goes
to
the
intent
of
the
manufacturer.
if
you're
talking
about
primarily
intended,
it
goes
to
the
person
who
uses
the
item.
the
seller,
in
this
case,
has
nothing.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
you
can
have
two
separate
categories
of
items.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
however
in
this
case
you
have--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--in
designed
for
use
it
goes
to
the
manufacturer.
she
was
not
the
designer,
so
consequently
she
can't
be
held
liable
or
the
jury
find
her
intent
based
upon
who
designed
it.
if
you
go
to
primary
intent--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--you're
convicting
the
item.
it
would
be
insufficient
because
the
jury
has
no
idea
on
dual-purpose
items
unless
you
tell
them
that
it
goes
to
the
intent
of
the
person
who
does,
in
fact,
use
the
item.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
some
are
not,
that
is
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
but
you
can't
tell
by
the
way
the
court
instructed
the
jury
in
37
and
39.
you
can't
tell
that
because
he
tells
them,
per
se,
these
list
of
15
items
are
in
fact,
per
se,
drug
paraphernalia.
then
he
gave
the
jury
no
option.
he
gave
them
a
directed
verdict.
and
giving
a
jury...
the
jury
a
directed
verdict,
the
government
had
the
benefit
and
the
defendant
had
no
opportunity
at
all
to
make
any
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
jury
could
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
dual-purpose
items.
and
that's
the
problem
with
statutes
like
this,
because
you
have
dual-purpose
items
and
you
don't
tell
the
jury--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well,
your
understanding
the...
in
this
case
the
jury
was,
in
fact,
instructed
that
her
intent
was
not
related
to
any
knowledge.
so
the
jury
was
confused.
you
don't
know
why
a
jury
reached
a
particular
decision
on
a
matter.
clearly
enough,
they
did
give
the
knowledge
instructions
on
some
other
factors.
but
the
drug
paraphernalia
case
was
only
a
predicate
offense
for
the
money
laundering
charge
and
the
aiding
and
abetting
charge,
so
clearly
the
jury
could
be
confused
on
this
point
and
the
jury
never
knew
that
the
subjective
scienter
had
to
apply
to
the
defendant
in
this
case.
it
was
clearly
an
objective
law
of
the
case
that
was
given
in
this...
by
this
trial
court.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
if
you
consider
proof
what
the
jury
reached
a
verdict
on
without
proper
instructions,
you
would
have
to
say
yes,
they
did
prove
it.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
we
don't
agree
with
that.
we
think
the
evidence
was
conflicting.
all
of
the
expert
witnesses
who
testified
in
the
record
on
this
case
all
indicated
that
all
of
these
items
had
dual
purposes.
so
consequently
when
they
had
dual
purposes,
the
court
had
to
direct
the
jury
someplace
to
find
the
subjective
intent
of
the
person.
so
where
did
they
direct
them?
they
have
to
direct
them
to
primarily
intended.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congressman
levine,
the
principal
author
of
this
statute,
indicated--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
we
believe
that
the
government
did
not
prove
that;
that
there
was
not
substantial
evidence,
due
to
the
conflicting
nature
of
it
without
some
indication
to
this
jury
that
the
subjective
intent,
what
ms.
acty
intended
that
these
items
go
for,
was
given
to
the
jury.
the
jury
had
no
direction
with
regard
to
that.
sure
enough,
the
government
now
wants
to
come
back
and
claim
a
knowledge
standard,
but
that's
after
the
fact,
the
knowledge
standard.
in
their
knowledge
standard
argument
to
the
court...
we
believe
a
fatal
flaw
exists
in
their
argument,
if
you'll
turn
to
page
19
of
their
brief.
in
their
argument
they
say:
"consistent
with
this
view,
the
district
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
term
primarily
intended
was
not
limited
to
the
intent
of
the
defendant
or
any
particular
person
or
persons.
"
if
they
had
given
that
instruction,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
they
didn't
give
that
instruction.
they
didn't
say
it
was
not
limited
to.
if
you
go
to
the
actual
instruction
that
was
given,
the
court
said
on
page
31
of
the
joint
appendix:
"the
term
primarily
intended,
as
used
in
these
instructions,
does
not
relate
to
the
knowledge
or
intent
of
any
particular
person
or
persons.
"
so
consequently--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--if
that
is
correct
it
has
to
be
remanded.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
which
one,
that
the
government
argued
in
its
brief?
mr.
alfredo
parrish
maybe
i'm
not
understanding.
if
the--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
we
win.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
because
the
court
did
not
give
that
instruction.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well,
we
don't
lose
the
case
because
the
government
argues
a
knowledge
instruction.
however,
the
court
never
gave
a
sufficient
knowledge
instruction
to
alert
the
jury
to
the
difficulty
that
existed
when
they
went
back
into
the
jury
room
to
deliberate.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
but
nature
and
character--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--i
don't
deny
that.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that's
correct.
but
also
our
argument
is
that
when
you're
talking
about...
we're
maybe
arguing
over
general
and
specific
intent.
we're
talking
about
a
punishment
here
where
an
individual
is
going
to
prison
up
to
20
years
and
facing
a
$500,000
fine.
so
when
you're
talking
about
that,
you
don't
talk
about
using
the
same
standards
as
we've
used
here
for
public
welfare-type
crimes
or
the
crimes
where
knowledge
has
just
been
the
type
of
thing
that
we
allow
people
to
be
convicted
on.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
we're
talking
about
sending
people
away
for
a
long
time.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
it
should
be
purposeful,
based
upon...
and
getting
back
to
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question
of
the
standard
that
has
been
utilized,
this
court
has
never
actually
confronted
the
mens
rea
standard
at
the
constitutional
level.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--it
would
be
precisely
the
same
because
in
applying
the
objective
standard
or
the
strict
liability
standard,
the
other
items,
mannitol,
procaine,
and
inositol,
were
items
that
were
included.
but
the
court
told
the
jury
they
to
had,
again,
look
at
the
objective
standard.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
okay.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
with
one
caveat,
that
we
still
would
want
to
know
which
item
did
the
jury
find
only
had
one
purpose
and
which
items
had
dual
purposes.
they
were
never
told.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
even
as
to
the--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--of
course.
because
even
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
items,
they
talk
about
these
items
having
dual
purposes.
and
every
federal
district
court
and
appellate
court
that
has
confronted
this
issue,
they
constantly
talk
about
the
dual
purpose
of
these
items.
and
consequently
they've
ended
up
with
tests
all
over
the
place
on
this
question.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
if
they
say
it's...
they
can.
and
if
they
say
it's
illegal,
make
it
illegal
per
se,
put
it
in
the
statute,
and
then
you
have
the
morissette
tight
fact
situation
that
you
have
to
confront
it
in.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
a
must
by
some
standard
higher
than
just
a
simple
knowledge
or
a
low
threshold
knowledge
standard,
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well,
drugs
themselves.
cocaine,
possession
with
intent
to
deliver
cocaine,
or
having
a
weapon.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
you
do
not
know--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--but
then
he
has
to
get
a
license
for
it,
and
if
you
have
to
get
a
license
for
it
you
create
a
whole
new
standard.
so
you
can't
compare
it
to
that
type
of
situation.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
a
citizen
has
a
dual-purpose
item
that's
available
at
walgreen's,
any
other
store.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
if
you're
talking
about
design,
your
honor,
you
have
to
go
the
manufacturer.
that's
what
they...
that's
what
they
indicated.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
and
you
establish
a
standard
that's
acceptable
for
high-threshold
punishment.
and
a
high-threshold
punishment
is
a
punishment
where
a
person
is
going
to
spend
a
substantial
number
of
years
in
prison.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
we
believe
it's
constitutional
if
you
set
the
standard
as
to
how
you
establish
the
knowing.
if
that
was
the
case
and
if
the
judge
had
given
that
instruction,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
it
would.
however,
the
statutory
list
admits
the
fact
that
these
items
have
other
purposes.
but
the
judge,
in
giving
these
instructions,
said
this
list
constitute
drug
paraphernalia,
and
over
the
objection
of
trial
counsel
in
this
case
the
judge
proceeded
to
give
this
instruction,
because
it
was
an
all-inclusive
list
and
the
items
had
dual
purposes.
some
of
these
items
you
can
go
to
a
hardware
store
and
buy.
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
statute.
you
are
enforcing
and
not
giving
the
jury
any
options
once
they
get
into
a
jury
room.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
of
course
they
can
be.
that's
why--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
it
said
it
did
not
know
the
nature.
and
if
you
go
again
to
instruction
31,
it
says
"primarily
intended,
as
used
in
these
instructions.
"
--on
page
31
of
the
joint
appendix...
"as
used
in
these
instructions
does
not
relate
to
the
knowledge
or
intent
of
any
particular
person
or
persons.
"
contrary
to
what
the
government
argued
that
it
was
primarily...
it
was
not
limited
to
the
intent.
if
it
had
not
been
limited
to
her
intent,
there
were
other
factors
that
this
jury
could
have
considered.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that
is
correct.
i
am
assuming
that
based
upon--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--but
there--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--the
instructions
do
not.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
the
instructions
do
not.
they
do
not
come
close
to
outlining
that
to
a
jury.
when
you're
down
trying
cases,
a
jury
has
no
idea.
they
want
to
follow
the
judge's
instructions,
and
in
this
case
this
jury
had
to
be
confused
when
they
had
per
se
instructions
on
the
items
themselves.
they
had
to
be
confused
because
there's
no
clear
direction
and
no
consistency
with
the
instructions.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
but
they
go
back
again
to
39
and
it
says
it
does
not
relate
to
the
knowledge
and
intent
of
that
person.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
but
the
problem...
the
federal
courts
have
confronted
this
issue.
they've
come
up
with
several
tests.
they've
come
up
with
an
objective
test.
they've
come
up
with
a
subjective
objective
test.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
oh,
it
can
be
a
knowledge
standard.
we
will
accept
a
knowledge
standard.
we
don't
accept--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--we
would
acknowledge
it's
not
enough
knowledge
as
proposed
in
the
instruction
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
within
the
statute...
okay.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
absolutely.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
absolutely.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
we
did
address
that,
judge...
your
honor,
when
we
outlined
that
all
of
the
particular
items
whereof,
including
instruction
37
and
39.
that's
addressed
in
our
petition
and
also
addressed
in
our
petition
in
our
brief.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
on
the
subjective
scienter
question,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
judge
accepted
a
fully
objective
standard
in
this
case--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--and
a
strict
liability
standard.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that's
the
standard
that
the
judge
adopted
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
that
was
the
one
that
was
not
in
the
statute.
it
was
the
primarily
intended
which
was,
in
fact,
in
the
statute.
and
that's
the
way
the
courts
have
been
finding
the
vehicle
for
intent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
based
upon
the
legislative
history
of--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--i'm
sorry.
oh,
i
thought
you
said
something
else.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
judge
rawley
was
the
district
judge
in
this
case.
however,
i
didn't
try
it
in
the
lower
court,
but
he
was
the
district
court
judge.
in
determining
how
to
find
legislative
intent,
as
i
was
indicating,
several
of
the
district
courts
and
appellate
courts,
when
confronted
with
this
issue,
have
been
confused
and
have
been
in
some
conflict
and
have,
to
some
extent,
been
inconsistent
in
their
application
of
this
standard.
some
have
arrived
at
a
standard
of
a
subjective
test.
some
have
arrived,
as
the
sixth
circuit
has
found,
at
an
objective
subjective
test.
and
some
have,
in
fact,
found
a
purely
subjective
test
with
regard
to
this.
and
i
think
the
confusions
in
the
circuits
have
come
from
the
fact
that
they
don't
know
where
to
find
primarily
intended
and
where
it
applies
in
this
particular
instance.
and
we
believe
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
congressman
levine
indicated
when
he
was
saying
where
in
the
statute
is
the
intent.
he
indicated
in
the
statute
the
intent
was
found
in
primarily
intended.
and
we
believe
the
court,
by
not
addressing
this
issue
and
applying
an
objective
standard
as
the
law
of
the
case,
deprived
ms.
acty
of
her
constitutional
rights;
did
not,
in
fact,
get
into
any
issue
with
the
jury
as
to
these
dual-purpose
items
and
get
into
her
intent.
and
consequently,
we
believe
this
case
ought
to
be
remanded.
thank
you.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
i
don't
intend
to
take
my
4
minutes.
i
have
some
specific
points
i
want
to
rebut.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
as
defined
in
the
statute,
justice
scalia.
but
my
point
would
be
that
the
proposed
instructions
that
were
proposed
by
the
government
would
have
been
acceptable,
and
it
would
be
an
instruction
that
we
would,
in
fact,
have
accepted
in
this
trial.
unfortunately,
it
was
not
the
instruction
that
was
given.
now,
i
realize...
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
chief
justice,
he
indicates
that
we
shouldn't
get
tied
up
in
instructions.
however,
when
you
are
facing
20
years
in
prison
and
a
half
million
dollar
fine,
and
it
is,
in
fact,
imposed
and
you
are
deprived
of
your
constitutional
rights
simply
because
the
court
did
not
apply
the
proper
instruction
on
the
statute,
that
is
a
serious
constitutional
problem
to
ms.
acty,
and
in
this
case
ms.
acty
did
not
receive
her
constitutional
rights
when
the
statute
was
applied
in
this
case.
the--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--and
instruction
39
was
taken
out,
where
it
says
that
it
does
not
relate
to
any...
the
knowledge
or
intent
of
any
particular
person
or
persons,
that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
that's
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you,
justice.
