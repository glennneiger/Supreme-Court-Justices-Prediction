justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
point--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
point
is
you're
saying
that
there
was
no
scienter
required.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
instruction
21,
subparagraph
2,
says
you
have
you
find
that
the
defendant
knew
the
nature
and
character
of
the
item.
now
that's
a
mens
rea
component,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
the
defendant
had
to
know
the
nature
and
character
of
the
item.
now,
it's
true
that
in
the
later
instructions
they
said
that
there's
no
intent
of
any
person
that's
required,
but
that
simply
means
that
the
item
itself
is
what
the
court
and
the
jury
should
focus
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
true
with
respect
to
both
kinds
of
items?
we
have
here
the
listed
items,
the
items
set
forth
in
the
statute,
and
then
the
catchall
classification
of
items.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
your
answer
the
same
with
respect
to
both
aspects
of
this
case?
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
only
thing
before
us
were
a
prosection
based
on
listed
items,
bongs
and
things
like
that.
would
your
argument
be
precisely
the
same
as
you've
been
making
to
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i
want
you
to
assume
that
the
only
thing
before
us--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
the
listed
items
and
the
jury
was
instructed,
as
they
were
here,
that
you
have
to
know
the
nature
of
the
item.
would
your
argument
still
be
precisely
the
same
as
you've
made
to
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
as
to
the
statutory
items?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
as
to
the
statutorily
described
items.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
bryson,
during
the
course
of
your
review...
and
you're
going
to
turn
to
the
instructions,
which
i
hope
you
do,
can
you
clarify
for
me
the
government's
position
as
to
whether
or
not
instructions
should
be
precisely
the
same
in
trial
a,
which
consists
just
of
a
trial
for
having
sold
the
listed
items,
and
trial
b,
assuming
that
there
are
only
unlisted
items
involved.
are
the
instructions
in
each
case
to
be
precisely
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
could
address
that
during
the
course
of
your
argument,
i'd
appreciate
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
intended
and
designed
applies
both
to
the
listed
items
and
to
all
other
items,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
the
statute
doesn't
make
that
distinction
in
its
language.
the
statute,
in
its
listing
of
the
15
items,
says
that
these
items
are
intended
and
designed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there's
no
distinction
between
the
two
classifications
of
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
does
that
square
with
instruction
39,
which
says
that
the
term
primarily
intended
"does
not
relate
to
the
knowledge
or
intent
of
any
particular
person
or
persons?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
i
were
a
juror
i
would
say
that
the
knowledge
of
the
drug...
this
in
the
case
of
the
razor
blade
hypothetical...
is
irrelevant
under
instruction
39.
would
you
submit
instruction
39
in
a
case
where
a
druggist
is
being
sold
for
selling
a
razor
blade,
the
proof
being
that
the
buyer
said
i
need
a
razor
blade
to
cut
my
cocaine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
instruction
39
would
be
inappropriate
in
the
case
that
i
put,
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you've
said
that
the
intent
of
the
seller
is
relevant.
