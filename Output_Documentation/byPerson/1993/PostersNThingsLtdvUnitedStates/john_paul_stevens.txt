justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
parrish,
there
are
all
sorts
of
items
that
have
dual
purposes
but
the
government
can
nevertheless
prohibit
their
sale.
say
switchblade
knives,
for
example.
you
could
say
dual
purpose,
but
couldn't
they
say
it's
illegal
to
sell
switchblade
knives?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
the
government
must
prove
that
the
retailer
knew
what
his
customer
was
going
to
do
with
the
item?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
to
know
what
his
customer
knew.
what
other
statute
requires
that
kind
of
knowledge,
where
you
make
it
illegal
to
sell
things
such
as
drugs
themselves,
you
don't
have
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
don't
have
to
know
what...
you
don't
have
to
know
what
your
customer
is
going
to
do
with
it
if
you're
indicted
for
selling
cocaine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
he's
just
going
to,
you
know,
put
it
in
his
cake
or
something.
maybe
he's
a
physician
and
he's
going
to
use
it
to
treat
somebody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
a
dual-purpose
item
but
the
statute
requires
that
it's...
that
it
was
designed
primarily
for
use
with
illegal
drugs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
and
the...
but
the
retailer
has
to
know
that
that's
what
this
item
is
primarily
used
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
of
course,
i
suppose
you're
doing
it
because
the
government
changed
its
theory
while
the
case...
after
the
case
was
granted,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--didn't
they
also
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
one
does
not
read
into
it
the
subjective
intent
requirement
that
they
contend
for,
that...
i
mean
that
if
it...
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
you
did
not
read
it
in,
and
therefore
you
should
read
it
in,
and
therefore
the
proper
instruction
was
not
given
and
therefore
there
should
be
new
trial.
didn't
they
make
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
supposing
someone
went
into
a
supermarket/hardware/drug
store
and
said
he
wanted
to
buy
a
cocaine
executive
kit
which
would
include
a
razor,
a
spoon,
four
or
five
items
each
of
which
is
a
dual-purpose
item.
went
through
the...
with
the
salesman,
went
through
the
store
and
picked
out
the
several
items
until
he
got
the
whole
kit.
and
they
said
what
are
you
going
to
use
it
for?
i'm
going
to...
i
like
to
smoke
cocaine.
would
the
salesman
be
guilty
of
a
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
stick
with
my
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
customer
told
him--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
i'm
going
to
do
with
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
clearly
was
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
needed
the
salesman
to
help
him
find
each
of
these
items.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
go
through
this
big
store.
justice
john
paul
stevens
change
the
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
it
violates
the
statute
under
your
interpretation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
can
i
just
ask,
is
your
acceptance
of
the
view
that
there
is
some
knowledge
requirement
in
the
statute
based
on
your
view
that
this
is
a
strong
canon
of
presumption
under
the
canons
of
statutory
construction,
or
are
you
of
the
view
that
if
you
didn't
do
that
it
might
be
a
serious
constitutional
question?
well,
maybe
that's
also
a
presumption.
why
do
you
make
the
concession
is
what
i'm
asking
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
bryson,
i
don't
mean
to--
[laughter]
my
example
was
the
kit
where
you
don't
assemble
all
the
items
except
for
that
purpose.
but
i'm
not
sure
if
you
have
a
dual-purpose
item,
the
primary
intent
of
which
is
taking
it
and
shaving
yourself,
the
fact
that
a
particular
individual
uses
it
for
a
drug
purpose
would
make
it
covered
by
the
statute.
