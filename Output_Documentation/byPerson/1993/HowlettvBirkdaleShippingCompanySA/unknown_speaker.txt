unknown
speaker
is
a
cargo
stow
an
object
or
a
function?
unknown
speaker
or
a...
or
a
task
or
a
place?
unknown
speaker
so,
when
we're
talking
about
a
cargo
stow,
we're
talking
about
a
certain
place
on
the
ship,
plus
the
functions
that
were
necessary
in
order
to
put
the
cargo
in
that
place?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
argue
that
the
shipowner
has
a
duty
to
go
into
the
cargo
stow
area
after
it
has
been
loaded
on
board
to
see
the
condition
of
it
and
to
try
to
determine
if
there
are
any
hidden
defects
or
problems?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
that
the
shipowner
only
has
a
duty
of
care
as
to
conditions
that
are
open
and
obvious
in
the
stow?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
theory
is,
if
it's
an
open
and
obvious
problem
in
the
cargo
stow
area,
then
the
shipowner
is
liable
if
in
the
unloading
process
someone
is
injured
by
virtue
of
that
condition?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it's
open
and
obvious
before,
during
and
after
the
original
loading,
and
it
is
open
and
obvious
at
the
time
of
the
unloading?
unknown
speaker
was...
was
there
a
finding
by
the
district
court
here
that
the
plastic
that
was
laid
under
the
cargo
was
an
open
and
obvious
condition?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
thought...
i
just
thought
that
the
district
court
had
made
a
finding
that
it
was
open
and
obvious.
unknown
speaker
the
district--
unknown
speaker
--the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
respondent,
didn't
it?
there
was
no
trial?
unknown
speaker
if
there's
no
finding
in
the
sense
of
it
being
in
a
bench
trial?
unknown
speaker
now,
are
you
saying
that
the
shipowner
had
a
duty
to
inspect
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
sovel,
as
i
understand
scindia...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
in
scindia,
there
was
no
negligence
by
a
person
engaging
in
providing
steve...
stevedoring
services
to
the
vessel,
was
there?
wasn't
it
just
negligence
by
the--
unknown
speaker
--by
the
vessel?
unknown
speaker
well,
regardless,
start,
finish.
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
negligence
by
a...
by
persons
engaged
in
providing
stevedoring
services.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
what
we
have
here.
now,
there
may...
here,
there
may
also
be
negligence,
as
you
say,
by
the
shipowner,
but
there
is
undoubtedly
negligence
by
the
person
providing
stevedoring
services.
unknown
speaker
and
the
statute
reads,
it
seems
to
me,
very
clearly,
that
if
the
injured
person
was
employed
by
the
vessel
to
provide
stevedoring
services,
no
such
action
shall
be
permitted
if...
if
the
injury
was
caused
by
the
negligence
of
persons
engaged
in
providing
steve...
stevedoring
services
to
the
vessel.
that
clause
is
absolutely
flatly
applicable
here.
it
was
not
applicable
in
scindia.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
it's...
it's
flat...
it's
a
flat
statement.
it
doesn't
limit
it
the
way
you
say
it.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
citation
to
kopke?
it
isn't
in
your
brief,
i
don't
believe.
unknown
speaker
in
the
reply
brief?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sovel,
have
you
pursued
a
claim
against
anyone
else
other
than
the
shipowners?
unknown
speaker
but
the
word
"employer"
is
not
used
in...
in
the
provision
that...
that
seems
to
flatly
cover
this
case.
what...
what
word
"employer"
to
which
kopke
could
be
relevant
appears
there?
it
says
that
if
the
injured
person
was
employed
by
the
vessel
to
provide
stevedoring
services...
that
was
the
case
here--
unknown
speaker
--no
such
action
shall
be
permitted
if
the
injury
was
caused
by
the
negligence
of
persons...
it
doesn't
say
employers.
unknown
speaker
by
the
negligence
of
persons
engaged
in
providing
stevedoring
services
to
the
vessel.
so,
what--
unknown
speaker
--it
doesn't
say
if...
if
it
isn't
caused
solely
by
the
negligence,
it
said,
if
it
was
caused
by
the
negligence
of
persons
engaged
in
providing
stevedoring
services...
not
employers
engaged
in...
just
persons
providing
stevedoring
services.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
why?
kopke
deals
with
who
is
an
employer.
the
word
"employer"
is
not
used
here.
unknown
speaker
they
could
have
said
that.
they
could
have
said,
if
the
employer
stevedore
is
guilty
of
negligence,
the
employer
won't.
but
it
didn't
say,
if
the
employer
stevedore.
it
said,
if
the
stevedore...
if...
if...
if
the
person
providing
stevedoring
services
was
negligent,
the
vessel
is
not.
unknown
speaker
in...
in
what
case?
unknown
speaker
edmonds?
unknown
speaker
which
is
what
we
have
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there...
there,
the
negligence
was...
was
independent,
separate
negligence,
not
what
you
have
here...
the
negligence
of
the
shipowner
in
failing
to
catch
the
negligence
of
the
stevedore.
i
mean,
it's
all
in
the
same
line
of
causality.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
should
have
written
something
else
then
if
it
didn't
have
such
an
idea.
unknown
speaker
maybe
you
know
that,
mr.
sovel,
but
i
only
know
what
i
read
in
the
statute.
and
it
doesn't
have
any
of
that
in
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
decision
in
kopke
wouldn't
have
been.
it
seems
to
me
that
that...
that
involves
quite
different.
unknown
speaker
which
isn't
what
we're
talking
about
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
surely...
surely
we're
not
going
to
say
the
legislative
history
prevails
over
the
language
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
we
have
here
surely
is
not
joint
negligence
in
the
sense
that
we're
talking
about
it
in
edmonds?
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
jump
from
that
to
there's
a
duty
to
inspect.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're
right
and
they
did
in
fact
inspect,
then
they
would
know.
unknown
speaker
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
rely
on
any
duty
to
inspect.
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
that's
contested.
and
so
you
have
to
rely
on
a
duty
to
inspect.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
don't
rely
on
any
duty
to
inspect;
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i'm
really
getting
confused
now.
i
thought
it
was
essential
to
your
case
that
there
be
a
duty
to
inspect
the
loading
operation.
you...
you
say
that's
not
true?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
they
do
it,
you're
saying
they're
doing
it
negligently.
but
it--
unknown
speaker
--it
doesn't
matter
if
it's...
if
they
do
it
negligibly
unless
they
have
a
duty
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
trying
to...
i
really
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
do
you...
can
you
prevail
in
this
case
and
still
assume
that
the
shipowner
had
no
duty
to
inspect
the
loading
operation?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
the
evidence
have
to
show
that
they
did
in
fact
know
the
plastic
was
there,
as
opposed
to
simply
standing
there
while
plastic
was
put
down?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
saying
the
evidence,
in
effect,
was
that
they
did
see
it?
unknown
speaker
because
they
were
standing
there
and
they
must
have?
unknown
speaker
but
if
a
finder
of
fact
concluded
that
they
did
not
in
fact
see
it,
then
you'd
have
no
case...
unless
we
hold
that--
unknown
speaker
--unless
we
hold
that
there
is
in
fact
a
duty
to
inspect,
as
justice
stevens
suggested?
unknown
speaker
no.
but
if
they...
if
they
have
a
duty
to
inspect,
presumably,
by
definition,
they
have
a
duty
to
exercise
a
certain
degree
of
care
in
the
inspection.
so,
the
things
which
ought
to
have
been
seen
are
things
that
are
going
to
be
charged
to
their
knowledge.
unknown
speaker
if
they
don't
have
a
duty
to
inspect,
then
the
most
you
can
rely
upon
would
be
proof
that
they
actually
did
know
that
the
plastic
was
here.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
that's...
that's--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
to
me
that
is
simply
another
way
of
saying,
well,
they
actually
did
have
a
duty,
because
we're
going
to
charge
them
with
knowledge
of
what
they
would
have
learned
making
a
reasonable
inspection,
whether
we
have
direct
proof
that
they
knew
it
or
not.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
unknown
speaker
how
does
one
discharge
that
duty?
to
what
extent
is
there
an
obligation
to
supervise
the
stowing
of
the
cargo
to
make
sure
that
the
ship
is
in
safe
condition
to
be
unloaded
when
it
gets
to
the
unloading
port?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
there's
a
duty
to
make
sure
that
the
cargo
is
in
safe
condition
to
be
unloaded.
unknown
speaker
so,
can
you
be
as
precise
as
you
can
in
telling
me
how
one
discharges
that
duty?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it
that...
what
is
the
relevant
thing
that
they've
admitted
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sovel,
what
was
the
theory
of
the
district
court
when
it
granted
summary
judgment?
did
the
district
court
rely
on
the
notion
that
the
shipowner
had
no
duty
to
inspect,
or
no
duty
of
care
here?
or
did
it
rely
on
the
theory
that
you
would
have
to
show
actual
knowledge?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
i...
when
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
i
interpret
them...
it
as
saying
there...
the
condition
of
the
plastic
was
open
and
obvious.
so,
it
wasn't
going
to
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
because
the
unloading
people
would
see
it,
too.
unknown
speaker
by
stacking
cargo
on
top
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
sovel.
mr.
buchholz.
unknown
speaker
just
as
a
preliminary
before
you
get
into
that
conflict,
who...
who
was
howlett
employed
by?
who
was
his
employer?
unknown
speaker
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--that's
different
from
the
vessel,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
does
the
statutory
exclusion
on
which
you
rely
then
apply?
because
the
statute
says,
if
such
person
was
employed
by
the
vessel
to
provide
stevedoring
services.
and
here
the
vessel
was
not
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
but
you
rely,
i
take
it,
on
the
second
sentence
of
the
provision
in
section
5(b)?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
statute
says,
if
such
person
was
employed
by
the
vessel
to
provide
stevedoring
services.
and
he
wasn't
employed
by
the
vessel.
so,
he
is
not
within
the...
the
exclusion.
or
am
i
just
missing
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said...
you
said
that
he
was
employed
by
someone
other
than
the
vessel.
so,
i
don't
see
how
the
statute
works.
unknown
speaker
so
that
we
don't
have
to
follow
the
precise
language
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
take
it
that
your...
your
case
requires
a
very
close
interpretation
of
the
act
in
order
to
allow
the...
the
vessel
the
exemption
which
it
gives.
but
i
just
don't
understand
how
the
act
works.
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on
this,
because
the
conflict
between
the
third
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
a
very
real
one.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm...
i'm
just
somewhat--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
uncertain
as
to
how...
as
to
how
the
language
of
the
act
applies
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe...
maybe
your
argument
shouldn't
be
relying
on
that
sentence
at
all,
because
what...
what
justice
kennedy
is
just
suggesting
is
also...
was...
we
also
explicitly
said
that
in
edmonds,
didn't
we?
edmonds
says
that
the
second
sentence
of
the
paragraph,
the
sentence
at
issue
here,
is
expressly
addressed
to
the
different
and
less-familiar
arrangement,
where
the
injured
longshoreman
loading
or
unloading
the
ship
is
employed
by
the
vessel
itself,
not
by
a
separate
stevedoring
company...
in
short,
to
the
situation
where
the
ship
is
its
own
stevedore.
which
is
not
the
situation
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
according
to
edmonds,
that
sentence
doesn't
apply
at
all...
zero.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
the
weak
parts
in
his
case
and
the
weak
parts
in
your
case.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
weak
part
in
your
case
is
edmonds.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
do
about
that
sentence
in
edmonds
which...
which
simply
says
that
this
sentence
has
no
provision
here...
it
has
no
application
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
buchholz,
i
can
see
what
you're
saying
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
typical
triad...
that
is,
this
certainly
meant
to
exonerate
the
shipowner
from
liability
to
the
employer
of
the
longshore
worker.
so,
the
things
that
stem
from
ryan
and
the...
the
usual
dance
of
suing
the
shipowner,
the
shipowner
turning
and
making
a
claim
over
against
the
stevedoring
company.
that's
not
what's
involved
here.
why
does
it
follow
that
because
congress
certainly
meant
to
do
that
and
did
that,
that
there
would
be
no
liability
where
the
injured
worker
is
not
employed
by
the...
where
we
have
an
unloading
longshore
worker,
and
he
is
injured
because
of
the...
of
negligence
attributed
to
the
loading
stevedore?
unknown
speaker
but
even
a
domestic
loading
stevedore
is
not
going
to
be
the
one
that
compensates
the
longshore
worker.
as
i
understand
it,
the
longshore
worker
is
going
to
be...
the
worker's
compensation
scheme
would
enable
him
to
make
a
claim
against
his
employer's
carrier.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
anybody...
let's
take...
make
it
a
seaman
instead
of
a
longshore
worker.
this...
let's
suppose
that
this
plastic
had
been
slipped
on
by
a
crew
member.
there
would
be
no
liability
on
the
vessel's
part?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
it
would
only
be
on
seaworthiness,
not
negligence,
to
allow
the
plastic
to
be
used
in
places
where
sea...
crew
members
might
be
walking
or
jumping
on?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
basic
claim
here
is
that
there
is...
there
is
simply
no
negligence
on
your
part;
is
that
it?
because
there
was
no
duty
to...
to
supervise
the...
the
unloading
and...
but
you
would
acknowledge
liability
if
you
knew
of
the
defective
condition
and
failed
to
warn?
or
you...
you'd
at
least
acknowledge
possible
liability?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
defect?
unknown
speaker
however,
if
you
happen
to
have
knowledge
of
the
defect,
you
would
acknowledge
that...
that
you
might
be
negligent
in
failing
to
pass
that
on?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so--
--well,
isn't
that
the
allegation
here
exactly?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
thought
i
heard
the
argument
and
i
thought
i
read
in
the
brief
that
the
shipowner's
employees
actually
provided
the
plastic
and
required
that
something
be
put
under
the
cocoa
beans,
gave
them
the
plastic
to
put
under
it,
knew
that
the
plastic
was
under
it,
and
subsequently,
when
it
was
loaded,
it
was
not
obvious.
i
mean,
i...
i
understood
that
to
be
their
theory.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this...
this
was
a
case
that
was
decided
on
summary
judgment,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
before
any
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
in...
so,
the
district
court
had
to
say
that
there...
this...
this
point
was
absolutely
undisputed
that
no
reasonable
person
could
conclude
there
was
actual
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
vessel?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
you
support
that
here.
you
say
that
that's...
that's
not
arguable
even?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
down
to
a
very
narrow
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
why
it
was
a
summary
judgment
situation?
i
mean,
if
the
allegation
was
that...
as
justice
o'connor
said...
the
ship
in
fact
had
supplied
the
plastic,
and
there
were
people
on
the
deck
who
were
watching
something
going
on,
why
isn't
this
a
question
of
testimony
and
credibility
to
find
out
exactly
what
was
supplied,
exactly
what
was
observed?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
buchholz?
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
he
has
really
two
alternate
theories
of
recovery?
one
is
that
as
a
matter
of
fact...
and
that's
what
you've
been
debating
now...
there
was
actual
knowledge
and
therefore
you
were
negligent.
but
that's
not
really
much
of
a
legal
issue;
that's
purely
factual.
and
the
other
alternative
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
regardless
of
what
they
did
or
did
not
know
or
anything
else,
they
had
a
duty
to
supervise
or
inspect
the
loading
operation.
and
they...
you...
you
can
admit
that
you
failed
to
see
things
there,
but
if
you
didn't
have
any
duty
you
wouldn't
have
been
doing
it
negligently.
so,
the
legal
issue
is...
am
i
not
correct...
i
mean,
is
it
just
whether
you
had
that
duty
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
is
such
a
duty,
the
fact
that
you
don't
know
about
it,
you
would
lose
under
this?
but--
unknown
speaker
--so...
so,
there
is
no
factual
issue
on
that...
on
that
legal
question?
unknown
speaker
and
what
this
boils
down
to
also
is
that
your
real
defense
is,
you're
not
negligent,
period?
you
don't
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
loading
stevedore
was
negligent?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--what
i'm
saying
is
that,
going
back
to
that
argument...
the
debate
between...
or
your
opponent's
colloquy
with
justice
scalia
earlier...
the
fact
that
the...
the
loading
stevedore
was
negligent
would
not
exonerate
you
if
you
were
also
negligent?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
you
say
you
were
not
negligent
because
(a)
you
had
no
duty
to
inspect
or
supervise
the
loading
operation
and
(b)
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
people
didn't
realize
that
this
plastic
stuff
was
there?
unknown
speaker
okay.
and
why
do
you
assert
you
had
no
duty
to
supervise...
or...
the
unloading...
the
loading
and
unloading,
i
guess?
unknown
speaker
well,
could...
could
i
ask
you
about
this?
you
refer
to
the
notion
that
you
accept
that
the
shipowner
has
a
duty
to
warn
of
hazards
that
the
shipowner
knows
of
or
should
have
known
of?
unknown
speaker
that
was
what
i
thought
you
said.
unknown
speaker
that...
that's
kind
of
a
general
principle
anyway--
unknown
speaker
--of
property
ownership,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
a
duty
to
warn
of
known
hazards
or
things
you
should
have
known
of?
unknown
speaker
you're
just
saying
they
shouldn't
have
known,
that's
all.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you're
agreeing
with
justice
o'connor.
i
think
you're
just
saying
they...
they
did
not
know
and
should
not
have
known
with
respect
to
the
cargo.
because
they
had
no
obligation
to
supervise
the
loading
of
the
cargo.
unknown
speaker
well,
is...
well,
is
that
really...
isn't
there
an
intermediate
position
that
if
they
should
have
known
for
reasons
other
than
supervising
the...
the
loading...
in
other
words,
supposing
they
turned
the
loading
operation
entirely
over...
the
ship
entirely
over
to
the
loading
stevedore
at
the
time
of
the
loading...
they
had
no
personnel
on
the
boat.
they
didn't
know
a
darn
thing
about
what
went
on
during
the
loading.
but
while
they're
at
sea,
they
should
have
noticed
something
that
was
rather
apparent
from
the
way
the
cargo
was
shifting
or
something.
they
would
then
have
had
a
duty
to
warn,
wouldn't
they?
they
find
out
about
the
danger
after
the
loading
operation
is
completed
and
for
nothing
to
do
with
it,
they
don't
have
any
duty
to
supervise,
but
they
do...
they...
there...
there
is
a
condition
they
reasonably
should
have
realized
was
dangerous.
wouldn't
it
be
negligent
not
warning
then?
unknown
speaker
no,
it's
not...
it's...
it's...
it
should
have...
they
should
have
known
about
it.
that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
it's
quite
apparent
that
you
can't
prove
anybody
actually
saw
it,
but
do
you
find
that
19
people
walked
by
this
place
every
day
and
you
can't
believe
they
didn't
look
at
it...
but
you
can't
prove
they
actually
saw
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wasn't
in
this
case.
because
there's
no
way
in
the
world...
if
you
ignore
the...
the
loading
itself,
there's
no
way
in
the
world
that
the
shipowner...
the
vessel
owner
could
have
known
that
the
plastic
was...
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
load.
i
mean,
you'd
win
this
case
on
my
hypothesis,
assuming
the
others.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
there
could
be
cases
in
which
the
shipowner
would
be
aware
of...
of
dangerous
conditions
that
wouldn't...
that
they
would
notice
while
the...
the
ship
was
at
sea
that
the
unloading
steve...
stevedore
might
not
know
about
unless
he
were
warned.
you
don't
think
that
ever
could
happen?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
that's
what
i'm...
but
why
shouldn't
the...
why
shouldn't
it
be
negligence
if...
if
it
was
sufficiently
obvious
that
any
competent
vessel
captain
would
have
spotted
it?
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
of
course,
that's
still
true
in
an
actual
knowledge
case.
unknown
speaker
that's
still
true
in
an
actual
knowledge
case.
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
that
a
condition
could
be
open
and
obvious
at
the
time
that
the
owner
starts
the
voyage,
after
the
cargo
has
been
loaded,
but
during
the
course
of
the...
the
trip,
the
cargo
shifts
around
so
that
on
arrival
it
is
not
open
and
obvious
and,
yet,
the
owner
would
have
been
aware
because
it
was
open
and
obvious?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
didn't
say
that
there
was,
but
just
that
it
was
an
open
and
obvious
condition
initially,
and
it
changed
later.
unknown
speaker
mr.
buchholz,
i'm...
you
know,
i'm
really
not
sure
that
your...
your...
your
alarmist
prediction
of
what's
going
to
happen
is...
is
true
to
life.
if...
if,
indeed,
the
shipowner
should
have
known,
there
will
always
be
available
the
argument
that
he
did
know.
and
so,
you'll
have
the
same
parade
of...
of
these
suspect
expert
witnesses
that
you're
worried
about.
the...
the
only
question
we're
arguing
about
is
whether
these
suspect
expert
witnesses
are
going
to
say,
yes,
he
must
have
known,
and
therefore
he
knew,
or
whether
they're
just
going
to
say,
well,
he
should
have
known.
is
that...
is
that
that
big
a
deal?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--as
we've
established
in
justice
stevens'
question,
you're
going
to
win
this
case
under
either
approach.
unknown
speaker
whether
you're
liable
for
should
have
known
or
not.
but
you're
worried
about
other
cases.
and
you
say,
well,
gee,
if...
if
you
make
"should
have
known"
enough
for
liability,
we're
going
to
have
this
parade
of
suspect
expert
witnesses.
but
you're
going
to
have
them
with...
with...
with
new
as
well.
unknown
speaker
if
you
should
have
known,
it's
probable
that
you
knew.
and
so
it
becomes
a
jury
question,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
typical
case
is...
is
the
one
that
justice
stevens
gave...
gave
of
the
cargo
shiftings.
you
know,
any
idiot
would
have...
should
have
known
that
the
cargo
had
shifted,
and
therefore
he
should
have
warned.
so,
you
say,
oh,
no,
well,
should
have
known
is
no
good;
you
have
to
show
that
he
knew.
so,
these
experts
would
say,
okay,
i'll
show
that
he
knew.
he
must
have
known,
because
any
idiot
would...
would
have
noticed
it.
that's
not
a
subject
of
expert
testimony,
whether
someone
knew
or
not.
no,
but...
but
the
point
he's
making
is
if
you
have
this
theory,
you...
you
would...
you
would
open
the
case
so
that
experts
could
be...
could
be
brought
in.
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
should
have
known
and...
and
actually
knew.
i
don't
see
that
making
a
difference
in
the
volume
of
litigation.
unknown
speaker
is
there...
are
there
occasions
when
onloading
and
offloading
proceeds
at
the
same
time?
you're
taking
something
out
of
the
hold
and...
and
putting
it
in
at
the
same...
and
putting
another
cargo
in
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
using
the
same
stevedore?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
buchholz.
mr.
sovel,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
there
was
also
testimony
that
plastic
is
used
for
a
lot
of
things?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
but
no
one
could
seriously
contend
that.
a
jury
would
be
entitled
to
say,
even
though
he
doesn't
admit
to
seeing
it,
we
infer
from
other
evidence
that
he
did
see
it.
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
isn't,
then
the
jury
shouldn't
infer
it.
unknown
speaker
i'm
satisfied
on
that,
counsel.
i
think
you're
right.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
