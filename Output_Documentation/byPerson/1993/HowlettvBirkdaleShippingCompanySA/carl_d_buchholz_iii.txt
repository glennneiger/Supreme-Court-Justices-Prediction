mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
despite
the
petitioner's
denial
to
the
contrary,
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out,
the
duty
that
he
seeks
to
impose
in
this
particular
case...
and
we
really
do
have
a
conflict
with
the
third,
the
ninth
and
the
fifth
circuits
that
underlies,
i
think,
the
whole
case.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
northern
shipping
company.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
which
is
a
stevedoring
company.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
yes.
it's
called
northern
shipping
company,
but
it...
it
is
a
stevedoring
company.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
vessel
or--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--we're...
we're...
they're
seeking
to
impose
liability
on
us,
not
for
the
negligence
of
mr.
howlett
or
his
employer...
they're
looking
to
impose
liability
on
us
for
the
negligence
of
the
loading
stevedore
in
guayaquil,
ecuador.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
that
and
the
numerous
references
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
a
shipowner
should
not
be
liable
for
the
negligence
of
another
party,
including
the
stevedore.
you
have
loading--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--i
think...
i
think
you're
missing
the
act.
he...
he
is
employed
by
the
vessel
to...
you're
looking
at
it...
that
it's
northern
shipping
that's
hired
by
the
vessel.
i
think
that's
just
loose
language.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
i
think
the
reference
is
there.
mr.
howlett
is
employed
by
northern
shipping
company,
which
is
hired
by
the
vessel.
i
think
the
language
used
in
that
act,
as
well
as
other
acts,
is
that
those
longshoremen
employed
by
northern
are,
quote,
hired
by
the
vessel.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
right.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
my
argument,
your
honor--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--okay.
my...
my
argument
is
not
based
on
that...
is
not
limited
to
that
particular
section
and
that
particular
language
in
that
act.
because
that
particular
language
leaves
out
a
number
of
references
that
are
in
the
legislative
history
as
to
what
was
intended.
and
i
don't
think
the
act
includes
them
all.
but
it's
implicit.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
although
it
was
read
during
your
direct
questioning...
it
could
be
read--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--right.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
i
will
address
that
in
a
minute.
i
think
edmonds
is
actually
a
strong
point
for
our
case,
because
it
shows
what
will
happen
in
the
event--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--the...
the
edmonds
situation
does
not
impose
a
duty
on
the
shipowner...
the
legislative
history
behind
the
entire
1972
amendments
was
to
relieve
the
shipowner
of
any
liability
for
the
negligence
of
another
party.
and
despite
there...
there
has
been
some
changes
to
what
that
duty
might
be
from
the
petitioner
today,
that's
the
duty
they
seek
to
impose...
that
we...
they
seek
to
hold
the
shipowner
liable
for
the
negligence
of
the
stevedore...
in
this
particular
case,
the
negligence
of
the
loading
stevedore.
now,
in
the
edmonds
situation--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--there
are
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
one
is
there
is
no
basis
to,
as
a
matter
of
law
or
a
matter
of
fact...
essentially,
you
get
into
a
distinction
between
perhaps
a
foreign-loading
stevedore
and
a
domestic
stevedore,
who
is
covered
under
this
act.
and
there
is
no
distinction
to
create
separate
duties
on
what
the
shipowner's
duty
is
vis-a-vis
the
cargo,
as
to
whether
it's
a
foreign
stevedore
that's
loading
it
or
a
domestic
stevedore.
the
other
situation...
and
it's
where
scindia
comes
into
play...
is--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--right.
but
if
you
get
a
domestic
stevedore
who
loads
this
cargo,
and
then
the
longshoreman
is
injured
down
in
houston.
under...
under
plaintiff's
theory
of
liability,
we
can
be
liable
down
in
houston
for
the
accident
to
the
longshoreman
in
houston
because
of
what
the
stevedore
up
in
philadelphia
did.
under
the
scindia
holding,
we
had
no
duty
to
supervise
the
loading
operation
of
the
philadelphia
stevedore
up
in
philadelphia.
but
suddenly,
now
that
we're
down
in
houston,
we're
subject
to
liability.
so,
if--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--no;
there
would...
there
would
probably
be
liability
on
the
vessel's
part.
the
vessel
owes
a
duty
of...
it's
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness...
to
seamen
and
crew
members.
that
was
the
doctrine
that
was
taken
away
by
the
1972
amendments...
the
supreme
court,
in
a
case
called
sieracki,
extended
that--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--i...
i
would...
there
could
be
a
case
in
which,
if
the
shipowner
knew
about
it
or
had
constructive
knowledge
of
it,
you
might
be
able
to
make
out
a
case
of
negligence.
in
most...
in
most
cases,
a
seaman
would
just
use
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
because
it's
an
unseaworthy
condition.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
you...
you...
because
of
the
scindia
case
and
the
lack
of
any
obligation
to
supervise
the
work
of
the
loading
or
discharging
stevedore,
you--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--right,
right.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
my
proposed
duty
would...
would
be,
if
you
had
actual
knowledge
of
a
hidden
defect
that
you
knew
or
had
to
reason
to
know
would
present
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
to
experienced
longshoremen.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
in
that
limited
situation,
you
would
have
a
duty
vis-a-vis
the
longshoremen
in
the
next
port.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
no.
the...
the
allegation
here
is
that
there
was
no
actual
knowledge;
there
was
no...
no
duty
to--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--that
may
be
their
theory,
justice
o'connor...
if
that
was
the
record,
there
would
be
liability
in
this
case.
but
that
was
not
the
record.
the
record
was
that
the
ship
supplied
all
material...
the
wood,
the
paper,
plastic
that's
used
for
a
number
of
purposes.
the
ship
would...
the
testimony
was
the
ship
would
not
have
permitted
the
plastic
to
be
laid
down
because
of
possible
condensation
damage
to
the
beans.
and
the
captain
said,
if
i
saw
it,
i
would
have
had
it
removed.
the
crew
members
were
under
instructions
to
notify
me
if
it
was
down
there.
so,
that
was
the...
the
shortcoming
of
the
case
that
there
was
no
actual
knowledge.
if
there
had
been
actual
knowledge,
the
plastic
wouldn't
have
been
down
there.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
before
any
trial.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
yes...
which
he
did.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
right.
there
was
no
evidence
to
suggest
to
the
contrary,
and
all
the
evidence...
the
evidence
all
suggested
to
the
contrary...
that
the
ship
would
not
have
permitted
it
to
have
sailed
with
plastic
under
it
if
it
had
known
about
it.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
plastic
is
used
for
a
number
of
purposes
on
the
ship.
and
it...
it
was
potentially
damaging
to
the
ship's
cargo
to
have
allowed
it
there.
the
other
shortcoming
in
the
standard
that
we...
that
i
was
discussing
with
justice
scalia
is
that
the
ship
had
absolutely...
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
ship
knew
or
should
have
known
a
piece
of
plastic
on
that
floor
of
the
hatch
was
going
to
present
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
to
an
experienced
longshoremen.
the
potential
danger...
the
only
potential
danger
that
was
established
in
the
record
was
that
it
might
cause
some
condensation
damage
to
the
beans.
but
you
wouldn't--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--that
was,
your
honor.
and
the
only
evidence
that
was...
was
available
was...
was
that
no
one
saw
it.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
presented
no
evidence
that
anyone
actually
saw
it,
took
no
depositions
to
establish
that,
and
the
record
was
closed
at
the
time
the
summary
judgment
was
granted.
there
was
nothing
more
than
the
fact
that
there
were
some
crew
members
up
on
deck
who
had
a
general
duty
of
watching
for
smugglers,
for
stowaways,
whatever.
and
the
third
circuit,
in
derr,
quite
correctly
said
you
cannot
catapult
that
type
of
presence
to
putting
a
duty
on
them
to
have--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--well,
again,
the
legal
duty,
as
justice
kennedy
referred
to
throughout,
the
difference
between
the
ninth
and
the
fifth
in
the
circuit
is
whether
there
is
a
legal
duty
to
do
inspections
or
supervisions
of
the
cargo
stow
during
the
loading
by
the
stevedore.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
the
question
and
what
the
circuit
court--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--well,
somebody...
if
there
was
negligence--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
exactly.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
that
is
a
duty
that
has...
that
the
genesis
is
the
ninth
circuit's
case
in
turner.
turner
felt...
was
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
an
injured
longshoreman
was
hurt.
the
ninth
circuit
took
a
look
at
the
situation
and
realized
that
the
negligence
had
been
that
of
a
foreign
stevedore,
and
decided
that
the
longshoreman
didn't
have
anyone
to
sue.
so,
they
turned
around
and
said,
well,
we're
going
to
create
a...
a
liability
on
the
shipowner
to
have
had
supervised
the
loading
of
the
foreign
stevedore
to
prevent
any
defects
in
the
stow.
and,
again,
that
doesn't
reconcile
with
your
holding
scindia
that
you
don't
have
a
duty
to
supervise
the
minute
details
of
the
loading
operation.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
if
you
put
any
duty
other
than
the
duty
i
discussed
with
justice
scalia,
where
you
have
actual
knowledge
of
a
dangerous
hazard
which
you
knew
or
should
have
known
would
create
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm,
if
you
put
any
duty
of
reasonable
inspection
it
will
essentially
open
up
every
one
of
these
cases
to
a
third-party
lawsuit.
any
stevedoring
expert
can
come
in
after
an
accident
and
say,
a
reasonable
inspection
would
have
disclosed
this.
so,
essentially,
you're...
you're
getting...
the
two
purposes
of
congress
in
passing
the
'72
amendments
was
to
eliminate
the
personal
injury
litigation
that
was
flooding
the
federal
courts,
arising
out
of
these
kind
of
accidents,
put
them
into
a
very
improved
compensation
system,
and
also
to
encourage
the
safety
of
the
longshoremen.
i
would
just
like
to
touch
on
the
edmonds
case
for
a
second,
because
that...
that--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--no,
no.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
if...
if
i
said
that,
i
misstated
it.
with
regard
to
the
cargo...
and
if
i
can
just
back--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--right.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
that's
the
duty
the
vessel
owes--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--that's
the
vessel
that...
that
this
court
imposed
in
scindia
and
the...
of
knowledge
or
should
have
known
relates
to
the
vessel
and
its...
its
equipment,
its
appurtenances,
its
gears,
things
that
are
permanently
attach...
attached
to
it
and
affixed
to
it.
the
ship
does
have
that
duty.
with
regard
to
cargo,
which
is
a
completely
transitory
condition,
employees
of
an
independent
contractor
put
it
on,
employees
of
another
independent
contractor
take
it
off.
the--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--it
requires
actual
knowledge.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
right.
and
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
they...
it
would...
under
my
interpretation,
it
would
require
actual
knowledge,
just
because,
as
justice
scalia
said,
you
don't
have
a
duty
to
inspect.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
again,
if
you
have
the
elements
of
actual
knowledge
of
a--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--okay.
that--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
no.
there's
no
duty
because
the
stevedore
that's
going
to
discharge
that
cargo
upon
arrival
is
in
as
good,
if
not
better
a
position,
to
take
a
look
and
see
what
the
condition
of
that
cargo
is
as
some
nonexpert
shipowner.
so,
the
condition
that
the
shipowner...
that's
observable
to
the
shipowner
at
that
point
in
time
is
equally
observable
to
the
discharging
stevedore.
and
creating
any...
creating
any
type
of
general
duty
is
going
to
throw...
throw
the
courts
back
into
the
pre-1972
amendments,
where
every--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--that...
on
your
hypothesis.
but...
but
ships
in
transit,
throughout
transit,
are
going
to
encounter
cargo
that
shifts.
and
in
every
one
of
those
cases...
and
that's...
that's
where
you...
the
fifth
circuit
runs
into
problems,
the
ninth
circuit,
in
riggs...
they
have
shifting...
it's
open
and
obvious
when
they
come
into
port.
the
longshoremen
are
all
aware
of
it.
and
that's
why
they're
hired
to
take
it
out.
and
yet,
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuits
are
imposing
liability
on
the...
on
the
shipowners.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
i...
i...
i
think
you're
getting
very...
very
close
to
the
actual
knowledge
situation
in
that
scenario.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
the
reason
for
that
is
any
so-called
expert
is
going
to
be
able
to
come
in
after
the
accident
and
say,
a
reasonably
competent
shipowner
or
master
should
have...
and
that's
enough
to
get
to
the
jury.
and
we
get
back
to
the
edmonds
case
in
which
a
1
percent
negligent
shipowner...
if
you
impose
any
duty
on
the
shipowner
for
the
condition
of
the
cargo
loaded
by
someone
else,
the
1
percent
negligent
shipowner
gets
stuck
for
99
percent...
gets
stuck
for
the
entire
verdict,
where
the
discharging
stevedore,
who
sees
the
same
condition,
gets
off
scot
free...
not
only
gets
off
scot
free,
but
gets
back
his
entire
compensation
lien
that
he's
paid
to
the
injured
longshoreman.
and
that
was
a
concern
of
chief
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--excuse
me?
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
in
an
actual
case,
there's
a
basis
to
impose
liability
on
the
shipowner
for
that
situation.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
in
that
situation,
again,
you...
you
have
actual
knowledge
of
a...
of
a...
a...
if
you
have
actual
knowledge,
which--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--well,
if...
if
it's
an
open
and
obvious
condition...
if
the
shipowner
does
not
have
actual
knowledge
of
it,
no,
there
is...
there
is
no
such
duty.
because,
again,
then
you'll
get
into
a
factual
question
in
every
one
of
these
cases
as
to
what
the
shipowner
should
have
seen
at
the
time
of
loading.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
you
don't
get
to
court
as
you
see
in
this
case
unless
you
prove
actual
knowledge...
unless
you
can
prove
there
were
long...
crew
members--
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
--right.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
i
don't
think
there's...
there
has
been
a
very
limited
number
of
cases
in
the
third
circuit
where
this
duty
has
been
imposed
for...
for
exactly
that
reason...
that
the
standard
under
the
derr
case
is
admittedly
extremely
limited.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
as
to...
on
which
duty
is...
should
have
known
is
your
honor
referring
to?
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
having
tried
cases
since
1970
and
seen
what
changes
the
derr
situation
made
in
the
third
circuit,
i...
i
have
to
respectfully
differ
with
you.
it
made
a
considerable
difference.
because,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
actual
knowledge
is
far
different
than
should
have,
or
would
have,
or
could
have,
that
an
expert
may
be
able
to
testify.
the
courts
just
don't
permit...
they
take
a
very
close
scrutiny
as
to
what
actual
testimony...
what
actual
knowledge
is
in
the
record,
if
there
is
any.
and
if
it's
not
there,
there...
there
is
no
cause
of
action.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
yes.
it's
not
necessarily
the
same...
the
same
ship
at
the
same
port...
you
may
be
loading
one
hatch,
taking
it
out
at
another
hatch.
usually,
it's
not
in
the...
vis-a-vis
the
same
hatch,
it's
not
going
on
at
the
same
time.
they'll
usually
wait
till
you
finish
taking
out
the
cargo,
then
they'll
put
new
cargo
in.
mr.
carl
d.
buchholz,
iii
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
unless
there
is
any
additional
questions,
i
have
nothing
further,
but
would
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
and
the
lower
court
in
the
howlett
case.
