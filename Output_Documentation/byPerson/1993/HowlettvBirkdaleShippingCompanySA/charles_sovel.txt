mr.
charles
sovel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
scindia
steam
navigation
company
v.
de
los
santos,
this
court
held
that
a
shipowner's
duty
of
care
owed
to
longshoremen
extended
to
unsafe
conditions
existing
at
the
start
of
cargo
operations
and
that,
as
to
such
conditions,
the
shipowner
had
a
duty
of
inspection.
the
scindia
decision
did
not
specifically
address
the
issue
of
whether
this
duty
applied
to
unsafe
conditions
existing
in
a
cargo
stow.
nor
did
it
make
any
distinction
based
on
who
may
have
created
a
particular
unsafe
condition.
rather,
the
focus
of
the
scindia
decision
was
on
the
shipowner's
knowledge
of
an
unsafe
condition,
with
the
principle
issue
in
scindia
being
the
ship...
on
the
shipowner's
duty
of
inspection.
thus,
in
scindia,
this
court
held
that,
as
to
unsafe
conditions
existing
at
the
start
of
cargo
operations,
the
shipowner
had
a
duty
of
inspection
and
was
charged
with
knowledge
of
those
conditions,
which
would
have
been
discovered
by
a
reasonable
inspection,
but
that
once
cargo
operations
began,
the
shipowner
had
no
ongoing
or
continuing
duty
of
inspection
to
discover
unsafe
conditions
which
might
arise
within
the
confines
of
those
cargo
operations.
in
derr
v.
kawasaki
kisen
k.k.,
the
third
circuit
erroneously
interpreted
scindia
as
relieving
a
shipowner
from
any
duty
of
inspection
with
respect
to
unsafe
conditions
in
a
cargo
stow,
no
matter
when
or
by
whom
that
condition
was
created,
and
without
regard
to
whether
a
particular
unsafe
condition
may
have
existed
at
the
start
of
cargo
operations.
mr.
charles
sovel
i--
mr.
charles
sovel
--i
consider
it
a
condition
of
the
vessel.
i
consider
it
essentially...
it's...
it's
a
fact.
it's
a...
a...
it
becomes
part
of
the
stow.
part
of
the
stow
becomes
part
of
the
ship
because
it
is
what
the
ship
is
being
carried.
mr.
charles
sovel
plus
the
functions
and
the
operations
and
how
that
cargo
is
held
in
place
or
stored
in
place
in
the
ship.
i'm
not
clear
on
what
the
reference
is
to
functions,
but
longshoremen
would
place...
take
the
cargo
from
the
cargo
hook,
move
it
into
the
stow,
and
place
it
in
the
position...
and,
presumably,
in
some
manner,
that
cargo
would
be
secured
in
place
and
you'd
end
up
with
a
cargo
stow
that
would
be
presented
to
the
discharging
longshoreman.
and
that
is...
then
becomes
a
factual,
physical
condition
that
exists
at
the
time
the
unloading
longshoremen
go
aboard
the
ship.
mr.
charles
sovel
no.
as
a--
mr.
charles
sovel
--no.
as
a
general
proposition,
no.
although
factually
there
might
be
certain
types
of
cargo
stows
where
that
might
in
fact
be
done.
my
argument
is
only
that
the
shipowner
should
be
held
responsible
for
that
which
the
shipowners
already
do
in
the
manner
in
which
they
observe
the
way
cargo
is
being
stowed,
the
conditions
that
would
be
disclosed
by
such
inspections--
mr.
charles
sovel
--to
the
extent
that
that
phrase
might
be
tantamount
to
something
that
is
discoverable
by
a
reasonable
inspection,
i
would
plead
the
answer
is
yes.
it's
a
question...
is
it
something
that
can
be
seen
and
be
determined
by
the
crew
of
the
ship
conducting
the
normal
type
of
inspection
that
they
would
be?
mr.
charles
sovel
if
it
was
open
and
obvious...
and
they
have
become
somewhat
words
of
art
and
i
want
to
use
them
carefully
if
i
may...
if
it
was
open
and
obvious
sufficiently
to
be
observed
at
the
time
of
loading,
even
though
it
may
subsequently,
in
the
course
of
loading,
be
concealed,
it
is
a
condition
that
the
shipowner
should
be
responsible,
because
it
is
the
type
of
condition
which
would...
he
would
have
knowledge
of
if
he
made
the
observation.
mr.
charles
sovel
if
it's
open
and
obvious
at
the
time
of
the
unloading,
insofar
as
there
might
be
any
duty
to
warn
of
that
condition,
the
fact
that
it
is
open
and
obvious
constitutes
the
warning.
however,
the
question
would
still
remain
as
to
whether,
assuming
we
have
an
open
and
obvious
condition
that
is
unsafe...
which
is
what
you
had
in
the
woods
decision
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
the
riggs
decision
from
the
ninth
circuit...
there...
the...
the...
the
condition
of
that
stow
may
still
be
such
that
it
cannot
be
discharged
with
reasonable
safety,
and
then
the
shipowner's
negligence
would
survive
the
fact
that
it
is
open
and
obvious
and
would
still
be--
mr.
charles
sovel
--not
in...
not
in
that
sense.
what
the
trial
judge
here
stated,
that
based
on
the
argument
that
the
presence
of
the
plastic
would
have
been
open
and
obvious
to
the
loading
longshoremen,
that
therefore,
since
it
was
open
and
obvious,
the...
under
scindia,
the
shipowner
wasn't
liable.
but
that
ignores
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
open
and
obvious
to
the
discharging
longshoremen.
it
was
concealed
by
that.
and
it
was
a
total
non
sequitur.
mr.
charles
sovel
no.
the
district
court,
in
essence,
made
an
argument
that
if
we
were
arguing
that
it
could
have
been
observed
by
the
loading
stevedore
and
was
open
and
obvious
to
them,
then,
by
definition,
it
had
to
be
open
and
obvious
to
the
discharging
longshoremen
or
to
the
discharging
stevedore.
mr.
charles
sovel
he
did
not
find
that.
mr.
charles
sovel
that
is
correct.
and
there
shouldn't
have
been
no
findings.
i
mean,
it's
a
question
of
sufficiency.
mr.
charles
sovel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
sovel
i...
i'm
saying
that
the
shipowner
has
a
duty
to
conduct
reasonable
inspections
of
the
manner
in
which
the
cargo
is
stowed,
yes.
mr.
charles
sovel
my...
my
authority
for
that
proposition
is
the
general
negligence
duty
created
by
scindia,
which
it
would
be
no
different
than
inspecting
for
other
conditions
which
exist
on
a
ship
when
the
ship
comes
in
and
is
presented
to
the
discharging
longshoremen.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
the...
the
problem
in
that--
mr.
charles
sovel
--in
the
scindia
case...
the
scindia
did
not
involve
an
unsafe
condition
existing
at
the
start
of
cargo
operations.
mr.
charles
sovel
okay.
mr.
charles
sovel
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
sovel
yes,
by
the...
but--
mr.
charles
sovel
--no...
that
cause,
which
also
was
interpreted
in
edmonds,
has
to
refer
to
negligence
by
the
employer
stevedore.
mr.
charles
sovel
and
it's
not
what
it
says.
mr.
charles
sovel
okay.
but
the
decision
of
this
court
in
kopke
v.
cooper
steve...
cooper
stevedoring
v.
kopke
made
the
decision
between
the
employer
stevedore
and
the
nonemployer
stevedore
for
purposes
of
section
5,
in
which
it
held
that
just
because
you
had
an
employer
stevedore
who
was...
because
that
employer...
that
stevedore,
who
was
not
the
employer,
was
subject
to
suit
by
the...
an
injured
longshoreman
and
by
the
shipowner
as
well,
who
stood
in
the
sues...
in
the
shoes
of
the
longshoreman
in
that
situation.
the
consistent
decision
has
always
been
that
the
employer
term
refers
to
the
employers
of
the
injured
longshoreman...
even
though
you
could
have...
the
act
itself
defines
employer
as
any
employer
of
longshoremen
or
any
stevedore...
the
language
has
always
been
that
the
exclusive
remedy
provisions
of
section
5,
which
limit
the
remedy
of
the
longshoreman
against
his
employer,
against
the
stevedore,
only
apply
to
the
employer
stevedore.
mr.
charles
sovel
it's
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
charles
sovel
yes.
and
it's
cited
at
cooper
stevedoring
v.
kopke,
417
u.s.
106.
mr.
charles
sovel
referred
to
at
page
10
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
we
have
a
claim
also...
a
pending
claim
against
the...
the...
the...
the
answer
to
that
essentially
is
no.
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
this
shipowner
was
the
charterer
or
the
actual
owner.
and
that
issue
is...
is
really
held
in
abeyance.
i
have
a
suit
pending
against
them,
depending
upon
what
happens
here.
but
there
is
not
a
suit
against
any
other
party.
so,
the...
but
coming
back
to
kopke,
kopke
is
a
situation
in
which...
it
essentially
is
a
situation
where
an
american
longshoreman
is
suing
an
american
stevedore,
who
is
not
his
employer.
and
the
issue
was
raised
as
to
the
division
of
damages
between
that
stevedore
and
the
shipowner
in
that
case.
and
they...
this
court,
in
kopke,
specifically
held
that
there
was
a
right
to
sue,
because
that...
that
stevedore,
because
he
was
not
the
employer.
mr.
charles
sovel
okay.
mr.
charles
sovel
okay.
mr.
charles
sovel
yes,
that's
correct.
but,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
only
negligence
that
is
involved
here.
because
if
the
shipowner
is
neglig--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
but
that
would
then
say
that
anybody,
including
a
nonemployer
stevedore--
mr.
charles
sovel
--is
to
be
exempted.
mr.
charles
sovel
no,
i
don't...
i...
i
don't
think
that...
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
hold.
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
kopke
and
with--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
the
term
"stevedore"...
the
stevedore
is
the
employer,
and
it's
the
exclusive
remedy
provision
of
the
act
that...
that
you're
dealing
with
here,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
you
say
that...
he...
the...
when
they
amended
the
act,
they
said
that
the...
they
were
saying
that
the
shipowner
would
not
be
liable
for
a
negligence
of
the
stevedore
in
the
context
that
they're
referring
to
the
employer
stevedore.
essentially,
that's
the
same
argument
that--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
then,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
you're...
the...
essentially,
the
same
type
of
argument
was
considered
by
this
court
and
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
edmonds
case.
because
there,
the
argument
was
that
we
should--
mr.
charles
sovel
--in
edmonds.
mr.
charles
sovel
edmonds,
where
the
argument
was
made
by
the
stevedores...
by
the
shipowner
that
they
should
apportion
the
damages
between
the
employer
and
the
stevedore.
and
that
specific
phraseology
of
the
statute
was
considered.
and
they
said
that
it
didn't
preclude
the
action
against
the
vessel
under
those
circumstances,
even
though
you
have
a
situation
where
a
stevedore
was
negligent.
if
you
were
to
take
that
language
totally,
justice
scalia,
then
you
would
be
eliminating
liability
based
on
joint
negligence.
and
suppose
you
have
a
situation
where
you
had
both
negligence
by
the
shipowner
and
by
the
stevedore.
under
the
interpretation
of
that
language--
mr.
charles
sovel
--yes...
well...
and
therefore...
but
that
was
specifically
rejected
in
the
edmonds
case.
that
was
the
specific
argument
that
was
made
and
the
specific...
it
was
rejected...
that
the
shipowner
cannot
excuse
its
own
negligence
by
saying
that
the
stevedore
was
also
negligent.
mr.
charles
sovel
your
honor,
if
i
might
posit
a
situation
to
the
court.
suppose
we
have
a
cargo,
say,
electronic...
electronic
parts,
loaded
on
a
ship
in
japan
or
korea.
and
the
ship
loads
that
cargo.
it's...
the
stevedore
loads
it
there.
it's
loaded
improperly.
it
comes
to
the
united
states.
cargo...
when
the
longshoreman
goes
into
the
hold,
the
cargo
falls
and
crushes
the
longshoreman,
kills
him,
and
the
box
of
cargo
gets
broken
all
over
the
place.
the
cargo
owner
could
then
sue
the
ship,
but
the
injured
longshoreman
could
not.
i
don't
think
congress
ever
had
any
idea
that
that's
what
this
statute
would
intent
to
result
in.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
i
think
it
did
when
it
said
that
they
have
negligence
based
on
state
law.
and
it
was
addressing
the
issue
of
the
fact
that
we're
not...
we
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
exclusive
remedy
provisions
of
the
statute
would
not
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
employer
longshoreman
liable
for
any
more
than
its
compensation
liability.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
that...
if
you
were
to
accept
that
same
interpretation,
your
honor,
your...
the
decision
in
this
court
in
edmonds
would
have
been
different.
it's
already--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
kopke
involves
the
interpretation
that
when
you...
viewing
the
term
"employer"--
mr.
charles
sovel
--no.
that
you...
that
the...
or...
or
in
the
term
"stevedore
subject
to
the
act",
which
is
the
phrase
used
in
the
legislative
history,
that
that
is
referring
only
to
the
employer.
now,
that's
one
face
of
kopke.
edmonds
handles
the
other
aspect
of
that...
that,
if
you
would
interpret--
mr.
charles
sovel
--no.
but
the...
the
language
of
the
statute,
as
pointed
out
in
edmonds,
is
somewhat
inconsistent
between
the
phrase
that
the
shipowner
shall
be
liable
for
its
negligence
and
that
the
stevedore
shall
be
liable
for
its
negligence.
and
then
this
court
rejected
that
type
of
separation
and
said
that
the...
this
does
not
preclude
liability
based
on
joint
negligence.
and,
therefore,
under
edmonds--
mr.
charles
sovel
--no.
we...
well,
we
have
a
situation
where,
under
principles
of
negligence
law,
a
shipowner
would
have
a
duty
of
inspection.
suppose
if
we
had
a
situation
where
the
shipowner
says,
i
saw
that
no
plastic
was
placed
under
this
stow.
and
the...
a
factfinder...
remember,
this
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment...
could
conclude
that
the
shipowner
did
have
knowledge
of
it.
then
the
shipowner
would
be
liable
based
on
that
knowledge,
even
though
the
stevedore
may
have
been
the
party
that
created
the
condition.
so--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
i...
i
think
that
there
is
a
duty
of
reasonable
inspection
with
respect
to
the
manner
in
which
cargo
is
stowed...
which
is
the
traditional
duty...
not
duty
so
much
as
what
the
practice
is.
they
do
inspect.
it's
never
been
denied
that
they
inspect.
and
now
what
they're
saying
here
is
that,
even
though
we
inspect
and
even
though
we
see,
we're
not
going
to
be
held
responsible.
mr.
charles
sovel
right.
mr.
charles
sovel
that's
right.
mr.
charles
sovel
no,
it's
not
contested
in
the
facts
of
this
case
that
they
did
in
fact
inspect.
but--
mr.
charles
sovel
--not
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the...
there
should
be
a
duty
of
reasonable
inspection
with
anything
that
is
turned
over
to
the
long...
to
the
discharging
longshoremen.
however--
mr.
charles
sovel
--i
say
that
it
is
not
true
that
you
have
a...
an
actual
duty
to
inspect.
i
think
that
there
is
a...
i
think
there
should
be
a
duty
to
inspect.
but
in
the
facts
of
this
case
and
in
the
facts
of
most
cases,
where
you
offer
testimony
showing
what
the
inspection
is
and
that
they
do
do
it,
that
the
shipowner
should
be
held
knowledgeable
for
what
that
would
disclose.
mr.
charles
sovel
yes.
mr.
charles
sovel
right.
well--
mr.
charles
sovel
--okay.
mr.
charles
sovel
yes.
if
in
fact...
and
the
evidence
shows...
that
they
did
in
fact
do
it.
and
in
fact--
mr.
charles
sovel
--no.
the...
the
evidence
in
the
case...
in
the
specific
testimony...
the
captain
was
that
if
the
plastic
had
been
placed
on
the
deck,
the
crew
members
would
have
seen
it
and
would
have
reported
it
to
him.
mr.
charles
sovel
they
did
see
it.
mr.
charles
sovel
right.
that
they
could
see
it.
and--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well--
mr.
charles
sovel
--if
the
factfinder
found
that
they
did
not...
the
factfinder
would
have
to
find
that
there
is...
that
they...
it
was
not
a
condition
which
they
could
see
based
on
the
inspections
which
they
admittedly
made.
and,
in
fact,
after
the
derr
case
was
decided,
we
offered
evidence
in
derr
that
these
inspections
were
created...
the
third
circuit
has
even
rejected
that...
so
that,
basically,
i
say
there's
a
duty
to
inspect,
but
that
this
duty
is
no
more
broad...
no
broader
than
what
they
are
in
fact
doing.
i
mean,
it's
not
an
onus
to
them,
but
they
have
a
duty,
for
instance,
to
inspect
how
a
winch
is
repaired.
do
they
have
other
types
of
duties
to
inspect
other
equipment?
does
it
matter
whether--
mr.
charles
sovel
--right.
mr.
charles
sovel
yes.
mr.
charles
sovel
that
would
be
correct
that...
i
think...
while
under
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
having
established
the
inspection,
and
that
it
was
a
kind
of
condition
that
is...
was
capable
of
being
observed
on
inspection,
that
should
have
been
sufficient
to--
mr.
charles
sovel
--that's
different.
mr.
charles
sovel
okay.
and
then
they--
mr.
charles
sovel
--yes.
and
i
think
that
they
have
a
duty,
under
scindia,
to
provide
a
ship
which
is
in
such
condition
that
it
can
be
discharged
with
reasonable
safety.
and
that
would
include
the
cargo
stow.
and
with
how
that
cargo
stow
then
becomes
unsafe
is
really
irrelevant.
mr.
charles
sovel
to
the
extent
that
the
term
"supervising"
implies
anything
more
than
the
observations
that
they
would
make
of
the
normal
stowage,
i'm
not
claiming
that
there's
a
duty
to
supervise.
i
am
claiming
that--
mr.
charles
sovel
--right.
mr.
charles
sovel
okay.
it
would,
in
various
cases,
depend
upon
the
type
of
cargo
that
is
being
handled.
but,
for
instance,
in
this
case,
observing
that
the
plastic
or
whatever
it
is
that
they're
supplying,
when
they
admit
that
they
have
to
make
sure
that
something
is
under
the
stow
of
cocoa
beans,
that
they
would
be
observing
to
see
that
is
present...
they've
admitted
that.
in
the
case
where
you
have
improperly
stowed
steel,
such
as
woods
or
riggs
or
those
cases,
just
looking
at
the
cargo
is
all
they
have
to
do.
in
fact,
you
can
bring
in
testimony
that
they
looked
and
observed
the
cargo
and
saw
it.
mr.
charles
sovel
here
they
admitted,
first
of
all,
that
they...
they
inspected;
that
they
would
have
seen
the
plastic
if
it
was
placed
under
it;
that
they
required
that
something
be
placed
under
the
cocoa
beans
so
that,
to
that
extent...
by
the
way,
they're
supervising
what
the
stevedore
does,
they
are
giving
them
the
material...
the
only
source
of
the
plastic
or
paper
or
whatever
it
is
has
to
come
from
the
ship.
the
ship
pulled
into
guayaquil,
ecuador,
and
anything
that
they
needed
to
load
the
cargo
was
supplied
by
the
ship.
the
duty...
there...
someone
at
the
ship
required
that
something
be
placed
under
it.
and
the
fact
that
the
crew
members
were
there
and
would
have
observed
it.
basically,
that
case...
and
i
always
maintained...
this
case
should
have
been,
even
under
derr,
presented
a
prima
facie
case
of
vessel
liability
because
you
have
proof
of...
from
which
a
factfinder
could
find
actual
knowledge
of
the
condition.
it
was
certainly
not
a
matter
of
summary
judgment,
and
summary
judgment
should
not
have
been
granted.
but
all
you're
saying
is
that
they
have
the
same
duty
of
observation
that
they
would,
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
i'm
not
asking
that
they
be
required
to
make
a
separate
duty
based
on
safety
for
longshoremen.
because
that
really
isn't
necessary.
but
the
same
duty
that
they
perform
or
same
task
that
they
perform...
making
sure
that
the
cargo
is
stowed
safe
for
purposes
of
delivery...
is
going
to
reveal
the
same
thing.
the
problem
here
is
that
you
have
a
situation
where,
even
though
under
the
customary
practices
and
in
each
case
if
you
took
the
testimony
of
the
chief
mate
or
the
captain,
as
we
did
in
this
case,
you
would
find
out
what
they
did.
that
if
they
have
a
condition
that
they
could
have
observed
by
the
reason
of
what
they
did,
that
they
could...
should
not
be
permitted
to
say,
well,
we
weren't
inspecting
for
safety;
we
were
only
inspecting
for
the
safety
of
the
cargo.
and,
therefore,
even
though
we
have
information
that
would
normally
trigger
a
duty
to
use
reasonable
care
to
correct
this
condition,
we
don't
have
to
do
it
because
we
don't
have
any
responsibility
for
safety.
mr.
charles
sovel
the
ship...
the
district
court
here,
relying
on
derr,
said
that
there
was
no
duty
to
inspect
and
no
duty
to
do
anything
with
respect
to
cargo,
period...
nothing.
and
it
didn't
matter
on
the
other
things,
because--
mr.
charles
sovel
--no.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
the...
the...
it
has
to
go
back,
your
honor,
to
the
derr
holding.
the
derr
holding
was
that
a
vessel
would
be
liable
for
unsafe
conditions
in
the
cargo
stow
only
if
you
could
show
actual
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
of
the
condition
and
that
the
condition
was
not
open
and
obvious.
based
on
derr,
in
preparing
this
case
and
arguing
it
in
the
district
court,
i
offered
the
testimony
of
the...
the...
the
captain
as
to
the
condition
to
prove
actual
knowledge
of
the
condition.
and
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiff
that
the
condition
was
not
open
and
obvious
to
him
and
was
not
one
that
he
could
expect.
the
district
court
stated
in
the
opinion,
in
a
part
of
the
opinion...
which
i
have
to
say
very
respectfully
to
the
district
judge...
makes
no
sense.
because
he
said
was,
well,
if
this
condition
was
capable
of
being
discovered
by
the
loading
longshoremen
in
guayaquil,
ecuador,
then,
by
definition,
it
was
an
open
and
obvious
condition.
and
under
scindia,
the
shipowner
isn't
liable
for
open
and
obvious
condition...
which,
by
the
way,
is
contrary
to
the
holding
in
scindia...
and
from
that
he
says,
therefore,
it
had
to
be
open
and
obvious
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
when
there
clearly
was
evidence
it
was
not
open
and
obvious
to
him.
i
mean,
the
decision...
the
statement
that
if
it
was
open
and
obvious
to
the
loading
longshoremen
at
the
time
it
was
created,
by
definition,
it
has
to
be
open
and
obvious
to
the
discharging
longshoremen
makes
no
sense.
it's
a
non
sequitur.
the
condition
was
concealed.
and
that,
therein,
is
the
problem
with
respect
to
the
situation
as
far
as
a...
from
the
standpoint
of
the
discharging
longshoremen.
because
the
condition,
if
they
observe
it
during
the
creation
of
cargo
operations,
subsequently
it
becomes
concealed,
and
then
both
he--
mr.
charles
sovel
--by
stacking
it
on
top
of
it,
yes.
if
the
court
pleases,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
sovel
if
the
court
please:
first
of
all,
one
of
the
problems
in
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
the
district
court
judge
did
resolve
issues
of...
where
there
really
are
factual
issues.
because
there
is
a
factual
issue
here
as
to
knowledge
of
the
shipowner
and
the
captain
of
this
condition.
because
we
presented
the
testimony
that
the
ship
supplied
it;
that
the...
required
something
to
be
placed
under
it.
that
alone
is
sufficient
to
at
least
raise
a
factual
issue
to
be
determined
by
a
factfinder
as
to
whether
they
would
have
actual
knowledge
of
its
presence.
it's
an
inference
to
be
drawn
from
those
facts
alone.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
first
of
all,
there
was
no
testimony
of
that.
there
was
none.
and
that's
a
very
important
point.
that
was
an
argument
by
mr.
buchholz
that,
well,
it
could
have
been
used
for
other
things.
the
only
other
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
another
use
of
the
plastic
was
to
the...
in
connection
with
the
loading
of
corrosive
drums...
drums
containing
corrosive
materials.
and
there
was
testimony
that
the
only
cargo...
other
cargo
loaded
in
this
port
was
bananas,
which
are
not
corrosive.
now,
this
argument
that
it
could
have
been
used
for
some
other
purposes...
let
them
bring
in
the
witnesses;
let
them
be
cross-examined
as
to
whether
any
of
these
purposes
are
reasonable
purposes.
there
was
never
an
iota
of
evidence
in
this
record,
other
than
counsel's
argument,
as
to
that
being
a
permissible
purpose.
now,
under
mr.
buchholz's
argument,
and
the
real
problem
that
you're
having...
i
think
your
honor
has
touched
on
it...
as
mr.
buchholz
says,
if
i...
even
though
you
question
my
captain
and
my
chief
mate,
and
he
says,
we
did
this,
we
observed
the
cargo,
and
if
he
says,
i
didn't
see
it,
then
i
can't
establish
a
case.
because
unless
he
admits
to
seeing
it,
then
there's
no
evidence
of
that--
mr.
charles
sovel
--if
there
is
other
evidence
to
support
it,
and--
mr.
charles
sovel
--that's
right.
but
in...
in
this
case,
there
was
evidence
on
which
they
could
find
that.
but
under
mr.
buchholz's
test,
if
he
brings
in
somebody
to
say,
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment...
that
he
produces
a
deposition
of
a
captain
who
says,
i
didn't
see
it,
the
plaintiff
is
out
of
court.
and
i
don't
think
that's
anywhere
in
the
law
of
negligence
that
you
can't
have
a
reason
to
know.
now,
i
would
want
to
address
one
issue
because
when
justice
scalia
questioned
me
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
sort
of
caught
me
short
and
i
want
to
go
back
to
that.
the
statutory
language
which
you
quoted
reads:
if
such
person...
now,
person
there
refers
to
injured
longshoremen,
because
it's
in
the
second
sentence
of
the
act...
and
by
the
way,
this
appears
on
page
three
of
my
initial
brief,
the
blue
brief...
it
says:
if
such
person
was
employed
by
the
vessel.
the
injured
person
is
not
employed
by
the
vessel.
the
injured
person
is
employed
by
the
stevedore.
mr.
charles
sovel
okay.
to
provide
stevedoring
services.
what
this
language
was
directed
to
was
for
a
situation
where
the
shipowner
also
acts
as
the
stevedore.
and
it
has
no
relevance
in
this
situation.
