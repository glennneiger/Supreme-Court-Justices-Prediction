in
the
course
of
loading
or
discharging
cargo
from
maritime
vessels,
accidents
can
occur
which
injure
longshoreman.
the
injuries
as
can
be,
as
they
were
alleged
to
be
in
this
case,
serious
and
disabling.
the
two
likely
possibilities
for
compensation
to
the
injured
longshoreman
are
first,
the
ship
owner,
we
say
the
vessel,
and
the
second,
the
stevedore
which
is
the
longshoreman's
employer.
before
enactment
of
extensive
1972
amendments
to
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
which
is
the
statute
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
the
injured
longshoreman
could
sue
the
vessel
on
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
theory.
now,
then
the
vessel
could
often
turn
around
and
sue
against
the
stevedore
seeking
indemnity
of
contribution
on
the
theory
that
the
stevedore
was
negligent
in
its
supervision.
of
course
this,
meant
lots
of
resources
were
diverted
to
lawsuits
instead
of
to
the
payment
for
the
injuries.
the
1972
act
changed
the
scheme.
the
act
provides
that
the
stevedore
is
liable
regardless
of
fault
and
it
provides
a
generous
schedule
of
benefits
for
workman's
compensation.
under
section
5(b)
of
the
act,
however,
the
vessel
is
liable
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
longshoreman
if
the
vessel's
negligence
caused
the
accident.
in
this
case,
we
assume
the
facts
to
be
true
as
the
case
follows
a
summary
judgment.
the
longshoreman,
mr.
howlett,
sustained
serious
injuries
when
he
slips
on
a
deck
covered
with
a
plastic
covering
or
overlay.
he
claimed
the
vessel
was
negligent
because
either
one,
a
newly
alleged
dangerous
condition
or
two,
even
if
it
did
not
it
should
have
known
that
because
it
had
a
duty,
according
to
howlett,
to
inspect
when
the
cargo
was
loaded
at
the
foreign
port.
now
the
courts
of
appeals
are
not
in
agreement
as
to
the
vessel's
duty
to
inspect
cargo
operations
in
a
foreign
port
and
we
took
this
case
to
decide
among
others
at
issue.
we
hold
that
the
vessel's
duty
to
warn
of
latent
defects
in
the
cargo
stow
is
a
narrow
one.
the
duty
attaches
only
to
latent
hazards
defined
as
hazards
that
are
not
known
to
the
stevedore,
and
it
would
be
neither
obvious
to
nor
anticipated
by
a
skilled
stevedore.
ship
owners
engage
a
stevedore
for
its
expertise
in
cargo
operations
and
are
entitled
to
assume
that
a
competent
stevedore
would
be
able
to
identify
and
cope
with
defects
in
the
cargo
stow.
furthermore,
the
duty
encompasses
only
those
hazards
that
are
known
to
the
vessel
or
should
be
known
to
it
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care.
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care
does
not
require
the
ship
owner
to
supervise
the
ongoing
operations
of
the
loading
stevedore
or
to
inspect
the
completed
stow.
though
the
precedents
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
are
not
necessarily
in
conflict
with
our
holding,
the
decision
in
this
case
may
have
turned
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
assumptions
as
to
the
vessel's
actual
knowledge.
we
think
the
better
course
is
to
vacate
and
remand
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
for
further
considerations
in
light
of
the
principles
we
have
discussed.
our
opinion
in
this
case
is
unanimous.
