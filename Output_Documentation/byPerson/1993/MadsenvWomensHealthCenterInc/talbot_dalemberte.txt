mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
cases
arises
in
context
of
an
extensive
and
sustained
campaign
directed
against
the
women's
health
care
clinic
in
melbourne,
florida.
this
clinic
provided
a
variety
of
services,
including
abortions.
the
campaign
employed
tactics
which
included
the
blocking
of
access
to
the
clinic
and
the
creation
of
rather
chaotic
conditions
around
the
clinic.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
i
think
the
testimony
showed--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--yes,
sir,
your
honor,
they
did,
by
conducting
a
closely
ordered
and
slow-moving
parade--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--they...
they
did
not
immediately
part.
what
happened
your
honor,
and
you
can
see
it
on
the
videotape
which
has
been
lodged
with
the
court--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--they
did,
your
honor.
what
happened...
i
think
as
you
look
at
the
videotape
and
listen
to
the
testimony
of
ruth
arick,
which
accompanies
that
videotape
and
explains
it,
it
shows
that
the
people
would
begin
to
approach
the
car
as
the
car
moved
off
of
u.s.
1
on
dixie
way.
as
the
car
then
moved
towards
the
clinic,
it
was
moving
through
crowds
of
people.
the
videotape
showed
one
of
the
days
when
there
were
not
400
demonstrators,
as
there
were
at
other
days,
but
they
showed
some
number,
and
then
what
happened
as
they
got
to
the
clinic
driveway.
people
would
slowly
move
out
of
the
way,
and
you'd
see,
i
think
in
the
videotape,
people
swarming
around
the
car,
sometimes
thrusting
literature,
attempting
to
thrust
literature
into
the
car.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
it
is
in
context--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--it
is
in
context
of
a
health
care
facility.
it
is
not
a
violation
of
statutes,
but
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
a
trial
judge
to
prohibit
that
kind
of
conduct
when
the
consequences
of
that
conduct
are
shown
to
impair
women's
health,
and
that's
the
testimony
in
this
case.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
yes,
sir.
the
testimony
is
quite
clearly,
from
dr.
snydle
and
from
the
nurses,
and
from
ruth
arick,
that
the
pulse
rate,
respiration
rate,
all
the
vital
signs
were
changed,
that
the
procedures
became
more
dangerous
to
women,
that
sometimes
people
had
to
be
delayed
or
turned
away,
they
required
higher
sedation.
there's
a
strong
health
care
interest
here
which
is
demonstrated
by
the
facts
in
this
record
and
uncontradicted.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
demonstrations
and
other
circumstances
that
upset
the
listener
cannot
be
banned
just
because
people
are
upset,
but
we
are
now
dealing
with
a
facility
that's
a
health
care
facility.
we
would
not
tolerate
this
kind
of
conduct
around
a
hospital.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
well--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--one...
the
doctor...
dr.
snydle,
yes,
sir.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--and--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--well,
your
honor,
what
i
would
expect
is
that
dr.
snydle
might
be
cross-examined
in
a
way
to
make
that
testimony
unbelievable.
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
the
trial
judge
who
sat
on
this
case
found
dr.
snydle's
testimony
quite
credible,
and
that
testimony
showed
not
only
that
people's
vital
signs
were
affected
and
their
health
was
affected
but
also
it
showed
that
people
turned
away
from
the
clinic.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
well,
your
honor,
in
context
of
people
who
are
coming
to
a
health
care
facility...
and
we
need
to
think
of
this
as
a
hospital.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
courts
could
do
that
precisely,
unless
there
were
someone...
they
might
issue
an
injunction
not
against
all
the
world,
but
if
someone
were
coming
around
and
stalking
you,
as
this
court
found
these
people,
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
stalking
the
clinic
personnel,
yes,
i
think
the
court
can--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--following
closely,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
yes,
sir.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
i
don't
think
that's
been
said
to
me,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--exactly,
your
honor,
but
not
the
kind
of
debate--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--precisely,
but
not
the
kind
of
debate
we
have
in
a
hospital
zone.
the
reason
we
pass
by
a
hospital
zone
and
we
see
that
sign
which
says,
quiet,
hospital
zone,
is
because
we
expect
that
to
be
a
tranquil
environment.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it
might,
depending
on
the
conditions,
your
honor.
if
people
were
going
there
for
treatment,
and
there
were
people
crowding
closely
around
in
a
way
that
was
frankly
intended
to
upset,
intended
to
block...
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
missing
from
the
discussion
so
far,
and
certainly
from
counsel's
presentation,
is
the
intention
of
these
defendants.
not
of
all
the
world,
not
of
all
prolife
advocates,
but
of
these
defendants,
their
intention,
and
announced
intention
before
the
trial
court,
as
stipulated,
they
intended
to
block
the
clinics.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it
clearly
would
not
be...
i
mean,
again
i'm
not
familiar
with
all
the
medical
tests,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
value
would
not
be
quite
so
high,
because
you'd
not
be
providing
treatment,
and
i
think
all
of
us--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--no,
sir--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--no,
sir.
the
trial
court
order
cited
to
the
doctor's
testimony,
and
cited
to
the
doctor's
testimony
relating
to
the
impact
of
these...
they
were
not
just
demonstrations.
the
trial
judge
called
this
area
through
which
they
had
to
pass
a
gauntlet,
and
if
you
listen
to
the
testimony
and
think
about
400
people
being
in
this
narrow
residential
street,
and
think
about
what
someone's
going
through
when
they're
going
to
that
facility--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--yes,
sir.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
well,
your
honor,
the
videotape
was
not
taken
on
the
day
in
which
the
greatest
number
of
people
were
there,
but
if
you
will
look
at
that
videotape,
and
while
you
look
at
it
think
not
just
about
the...
what
we
see
there,
but
think
about
what's
being
seen
from
inside
that
car
as
the
patient
is
coming
to
the
clinic,
perhaps
apprehensive,
as
of
all
of
us
would
be,
in
going
through
any
kind
of
medical
procedure,
and
think
about
what
happens
when
somebody
approaches
your
car,
somebody
does
indeed
swarm
around
the
car.
at
least
i
see
that
in
the
videotape--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--people
thrusting
literature,
attempting
to
thrust
literature
in
the
window,
sometimes
people
calling
names
of
people
who
might
have
some
expectation
of
privacy
coming
to
a
medical
facility.
i
just
don't
think
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
we
want
to
permit
going
into
a
hospital
facility--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--going
into
a
medical
facility.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
i
do
disagree
with
that,
and
if
i
may--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
listen
to
your
question
closely
enough.
they
were
not,
by
name,
found
in
contempt.
what
they
were
found
is
the
court
finding
said
that
the
respondents,
and
i
think
this
is
finding
a,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
appendix--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--it
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor,
and
i'm
sorry,
i
was
reading
from
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it's
in...
it's
point
a
on
b-5,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
b-5,
that
the
actions
of
the
respondents
and
those
in
concert
with
them
in
the
street
and
driveway
approaches
to
the
clinic
of
the
plaintiffs
continue
to
impede
and
obstruct
both
staff
and
patients
from
entering
the
clinic.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
by
name.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
indeed.
that
was--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--yes.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
in
introduction
i
think
i
can
find
only
one
opinion.
it
was,
i
think,
justice
stevens
in
hirsh
v.
city
of
atlanta
mentioned
that
time,
place,
and
manner
should
apply
to
injunctions
as
well.
well,
i
think
there
should
be
no
different
test,
in
a
way.
the
suggestion
of
amici,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
injunctions
should
be
looked
at
more
closely
for
some
reason.
the
point
made
earlier,
i
believe,
by
justice
ginsburg
was
that
an
injunction,
unlike
a
statute,
can
be
easily
amended.
it
can
be
modified.
if
we're
dealing
with
some
kind
of
a
special
circumstance
the
courts
are
free
to
hear
those
special
circumstances.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
yes,
sir.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
and
i
see
an
important
difference,
and
the
difference,
i
think,
favors
the
injunction,
and
the
difference
is
that
now
you
do
not
say
to
all
the
world
you
may
not
enter
this
zone.
you
say
it
only
to
the
people
who
have
said,
in
open
court,
that
they
are
going
to
block
the
clinic.
please
understand
that
that's
the
undertaking
of
these
petitioners,
and
indeed,
of
all
the
defendants
in
the
trial
court,
that
their
intention
was
to
block
the
clinic.
they
said
it
in
a
stipulation
before
the
court,
before
the
1992
injunction
was
entered.
these
people
have
vowed
their
purpose
to
block
access
to
the
clinic.
they've
said
on
the
record
that
they--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--do
not
believe
that
criminal
law
ought
to
prevent
them
from
blocking
the
clinic.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
well--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--well,
your
honor,
on
the
record...
and
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
for
some
reason
it
got
left
out...
at
pages
64
and
65,
the
stipulation
was
that
ed
martin,
judy
madsen,
and
shirley
hobbs
well
understand
that
peacefully
blocking
access
to
facilities
might
constitute
a
trespass.
they
feel
a
violation
of
such
a
criminal
statute
is
justified
by
their
belief
that
protection
of
the
unborn
may
merit
breaking
the
criminal
trespass
laws.
now,
what
they've
said,
they've
announced
that
the
spirit
of
wichita
is
coming
to
central
florida.
they've
announced
that
they
intend
to
close
down
abortion
clinics,
and
they
have
said
that
they
will
conduct
activity,
and
that
they
do
not
have
to
follow
the
law,
that
their...
it's
in
the
stipulation,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
well,
your
honor--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--section
(2)
they
did
object
to
up
to
the
point
where
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeals
in
florida
affirmed
it
in
december
of
last
year.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
well,
this
can
be
an
educational
process--
[laughter]
--and
yet
we
know--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--that
prior
to
the
1993
injunction
the
clinic
was
still
being
harassed,
and
indeed,
the
harassment
was
escalating,
and
we
do
know
that.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it
is,
your
honor,
and
to
illustrate
the
point,
if
these
particular
defendants,
who
have
a
record
of
harassing
intimidation,
doing
a
large
range
of
activities
to
block
the
clinic
and
to
upset
clinic
personnel,
to
try
to
drive
people
away,
if
these
defendants
were
actually
to
walk
across
the
street
carrying
a
prochoice
sign,
they
would
be
prohibited.
it's
these
defendants,
because
of
what
their
avowed
purpose
has
been
of
closing
down
the
clinic.
they
have
been
enjoined,
and
they
have
not
been
enjoined
as
a
way
of
trying
to
eliminate
speech
from
this
area.
it's--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--if
these
defendants
were
to
carry
prochoice
signs,
they
would
be
subject
to
an
injunction.
conversely,
if
a
prolife
person
not
acting
in
concert
with
these
defendants
were
to
be
in
that
zone,
they
would
not
be
prohibited,
unless
they
were
operating
in
concert
with
these
defendants,
and
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
what's
being
said,
it's
what
these
people
have
done.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
in
the
36-foot
zone,
because
they
had
used
that
zone,
the
court
found,
to
block
access,
and
those
findings
were--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--yes,
sir.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it's
simply,
they're
not
allowed
in
the
area,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
they're
not
allowed
in
the
area,
because
they've
avowed
their
purpose
to
close
down
the
clinic,
and
they
took
activity
to
do
it.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
but
your
honor...
your
honor--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--except,
your
honor,
there's
a
difference
here.
the
difference
here
is
that
these
rescue
organizations
do
not
represent
all
of
the
prolife
movement.
they
represent
a
small
fraction
of
it,
and
they
represent
a
fraction
of
it
that's
dedicated
to
shutting
down
the
clinics,
and
one
that
avowedly
says
they
will
violate
the
law
to
do
it.
now,
if
someone
shows
up
who
is
not
associated
with
them,
but
is
a
prolife
speaker,
they're
not
subject
to
the
injunction,
and
so
it's
not
their
speech,
but
it's
their
conduct--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--and
it's
conduct
which
they
said--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--your
honor,
i
concede
that
there's
a
possibility
of
some
chilling
effect.
you
have
to
make
the
judgments.
but
let
me
make
certain
that
the
court
understands
that
the
judgments
being
represented
earlier,
being
made
by
the
court...
that
is,
the
trial
judge...
i
hope
that
full
transcript
is
read
in
context
of
the
fact
that
these
people
who
were
charged
with
violation
of
the
injunction
were
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
they
were
not
under
oath,
not
under
cross-examination,
and
a
number
of
their
representations
of
the
facts
are
now
being
incorporated
into
this
argument.
that's
not
really
what
the
trial
judge
intended
by
this
order
and
i
think
it's
clear.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
there
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
a
portion
of
the
videotape
shows
a
demonstration
that
i
believe
one
of
the
clinic
personnel
and
was
commented
on
by
ruth
arick,
a
witness,
and
i
believe
that
there
was
also
a
nurse...
well,
nurse
pam
doyle.
there
were
several
instances
of
that.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
of...
in
the
sense
of
violating
the
statute,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
no,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
not
in
the
record.
there...
one
of
these
may
have
been
in
a
municipality
where
there
was
an
antiresidential
picketing
statute...
ordinance,
but
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
let
me
make
the
final
point,
and
that
is
that
the
protesters
now,
after
this
injunction,
may
stand
with
their
toes
against
the
pavement,
and
they
can
be
as
close
to
the
targets
of
their
speech...
indeed,
the
targets
of
the
speech
are
the
people
coming
into
the
clinic,
as
the
width
of
that
road,
and
since
all
people,
according
to
this
record,
come
to
this
clinic
by
car,
they
can
be
within
a
few
feet
of
anyone
who
is
attempting
to
come
to
the
car.
they
can
hold
up
their
signs,
they
can
voice
their
slogans,
and
they
can
shout
so
long
as
it's
not
so
loud
that
people
can
be
heard
inside
the
clinic.
they
can
stand
just
as
close
today
as
they
could
prior
to
this
injunctive...
injunction
of
1993.
they
cannot
stand
on
the
north
side
of
this
narrow
residential
street,
but
they
can
stand
on
the
south
side.
thank
you.
