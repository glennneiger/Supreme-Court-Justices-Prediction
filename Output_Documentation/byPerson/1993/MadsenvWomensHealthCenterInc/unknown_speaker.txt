unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
it's
viewpoint-based,
mr.
staver?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
application
of
the
36-foot
limit
that
just
says
you
have
to
stay
out
of
that?
do
you
take
the
position
that's
content-based,
or
viewpoint-based?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
on
your
theory,
every
injunction,
whether
it's
in
the
labor
context
or
any
other
context,
would
be
viewpoint-based,
and
i
don't
think
we've
ever
thought
that
injunctions
of
that
type
became
content-based
just
because
they
were
focused
on
a
named
individual,
or
a
group
of
individuals.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
similarly,
on
the
36-foot
zone,
i
don't
see
what
makes
that
content-based,
or
a
restriction
that
says
you
can't
make
noise
within
that
zone,
or
something
of
that
sort.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you're
really
spreading
this
content-based
and
viewpoint
thing
all
over
the
first
amendment
area,
rather
than
confining
it.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
answer
is
really
a
vagueness
challenge,
rather
than
a
viewpoint-base
challenge.
unknown
speaker
is
any
part
of
your
challenge
here
based
on
the
fact
that
the
injunction
enjoined
only
those
who
wanted
to
protest
against
abortion
and
not
those
for
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
300-foot
zone,
mr.
staver,
but
what
about
the
36-foot
zone,
which
is
what
justice
o'connor
was
asking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
she's
not
allowed
within
that
zone
at
all.
unknown
speaker
okay,
so
that's...
you
can't
say
that
that's
content-based
because
she
can
only
go
in
if
the
people
agree
with
her.
she
can't
go
in
at
all.
unknown
speaker
so
why
is
it
content-based?
unknown
speaker
in
that
extent,
every
injunction
that...
if
you
enjoin
a
labor
union
where
there's
been
violence
on
the
picket
line
you're
only
directing
the
injunction
against
somebody
that
has
a
particular
point
of
view.
doesn't
it
always...
isn't
it
always
content-based
where
it's
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
why
did
you
say
no
before?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you
say
yes,
and
that's
why
we
have
to
be
especially
careful
with
injunctions.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
seems
to
be
the
premise...
one
of
the
premises
of
your
argument
here
about
the
300-foot
zone?
i
understood
you
to
say
that
within
the
300-foot
zone
your
clients
could
not
distribute
a
leaflet,
or
offer
them,
and
could
not
speak,
but
as
i'm
reading
the
reference,
and
i'm
on
a-9
of
the
petition
appendix,
under
paragraph
(5)
on
the
300-foot...
covering
the
300-foot
zone,
there's
an
injunction
against
physically
approaching
any
person
seeking
the
services
of
the
clinic,
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
there
that
prevents
your
clients
from
standing
there
with
a
picket
sign
or
with
leaflets
ready
for
somebody
who
may
want
to
take
them,
or
even,
so
long
as
it
doesn't
otherwise
offend
the
noise
proscription,
from
saying,
don't
go
in
and
get
an
abortion,
or
what-not.
it's
just
that
they
cannot
go
up
to
individuals
and
importune
them
on
an
individual
basis,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is...
and
i
see
what
you're
getting
at
there.
you've
got
a
problem
of
images
seen
inside,
noise
penetrating
the
clinic,
but
there
is
in
terms
no
limitation
on
speech
which
does
not
project
images
inside,
or
rise
to
a
level
that
would
be
heard
inside,
within
the
300-foot
zone,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading?
where
are
you?
unknown
speaker
is...
just
so
i
don't
flip
back
and
forth,
is
the
same
thing
in
the
petition
appendix?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
quote
the
text
that
you're
relying
on?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
numbered
paragraph
in
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
b-11?
unknown
speaker
which
implies
that
the
respondent
is
saying
something,
and
clearly
implies
that
the
respondent
can
be
holding
literature
to
distribute
if
somebody
will
take
it,
and
that
was
the
only
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make.
unknown
speaker
that's--
--well,
you
may
have
a
different
issue--
unknown
speaker
--at
the
residence
zone
than
you
do
at
the
300-foot
zone
around
the
clinic,
but
there's
nothing
in
there
that
indicates
to
me...
in
fact,
the
indication
is
to
the
contrary...
that
you
cannot
speak
so
long
as
you're
not
heard
inside,
or
that
you
can't
hold
a
placard
or
a
leaflet.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
talking
about--
unknown
speaker
--the
300-foot
zone.
unknown
speaker
that's
entirely
correct.
i
mean,
i
understand
that,
but
they
can
be
within
the
300-foot
zone,
speaking,
i
presume,
at
a
normal
voice
level,
holding
their
placard,
and
offering
leaflets
in
case
somebody
is
willing
to
come
over
and
take
one.
but
they
can't
speak
to
anybody
unless
spoken
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
can't
physically
approach.
unknown
speaker
mr.
staver,
you've
several
times
said,
i
believe,
in
connection
with
your
responses.
was
there
a
time...
did
you
ever
seek
from
the
trial
judge
a
clarification
or
a
modification?
i
mean,
you
concede
that
the
first
injunction
was
valid.
do
you
concede...
because
you
said
you
don't
challenge
parts
of
this,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
that
first
injunction,
so
some
remedy
was
in
order.
so
my
first
question
is,
did
you
propose,
when
you
got
this
injunction,
any
modifications
to
clarify
the
vague
portions,
and
second,
having
conceded
violation
of
the
original
injunction,
what
remedy
would
have
been
within
the
first
amendment
limits?
unknown
speaker
judy
madsen
wasn't
around,
was
she,
at
the
time
the
amended
injunction
was
entered?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
that
she
had
come
there...
she
had
not
been
a
party
who
had
violated
any
prior
injunction.
unknown
speaker
had
she
been
demonstrating
after
the
first
injunction
was
entered?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how
could
she
move
for
modification
of
the
amended
injunction
if
it
was
entered
before
she
was
even
around
the
place?
unknown
speaker
is
your
position,
then,
that
this
injunction
may
be
valid
as
to
some
people,
but
it
isn't
as
to
the
particular
complainants
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
limit
of
your
argument,
just
these
three
petitioners,
and
for
the
rest,
the
injunction
would
stand?
if
you're
saying
that
judy
madsen
wasn't
around,
and
the
others
weren't
around,
this
injunction
shouldn't
have
touched
them,
then
is
the
relief
you're
seeking
just
to
excise
those
three
people
from
the
terms
of
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
let
me--
unknown
speaker
--just
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position,
are
you
arguing
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
evidence
doesn't
show
that
she
was
in
concert
with
those,
or
are
you
arguing
as
a
matter
of
law
that
if
she
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
protests
until
after
the
injunction
was
entered,
she
could
not
ever
be
held
in
concert?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
a
finding
of
fact
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
just
take
it
one
step
at
a
time,
because
it's
hard
to...
this
is
a
complicated
case.
is
there,
or
is
there
not,
a
finding
of
fact
that
judy
madsen
acted
in
concert
with
the
people
who
were
enjoined?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
not
before
us.
but
then
your
legal
position
is
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
she
came
in
after
the
injunction
was
entered,
she
could
never
be
held
in
concert
with
the
defendants?
unknown
speaker
well,
judy
madsen
has
never
been
found
guilty
of
anything,
has
she?
unknown
speaker
she
was
cited
for
contempt?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
sanctions
have
been
imposed
on
her
by
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
has
she
been
held
to
have
violated
that?
unknown
speaker
so
we're
not
talking,
then,
about
any
sanction
that
was
imposed
on
her.
you're
saying
that
she
is
subject
to
sanctions
for
conduct
that
she
shouldn't
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
broadrick
v.
oklahoma,
i
think
we
used
some
language
about
an
in-concert
statement
there,
saying
that
we
would
cross
that
bridge
when
we
came
to
it,
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
mr.
staver,
you
said
i
believe
in
your
brief
that
you
were
attacking
this
injunction
on
its
face,
and
that's
why
the
record
didn't
need
to
have
in
it
any
more
than
it
already
had,
so
when
you
speak
of
the
internal
operations
of
this,
that
seems
to
be
inconsistent
with
your
insistence
that
you
didn't
need
to
put
very
much
in
the
record
because
you
were
attacking
the
injunction
on
its
face,
which
seems
to
say
that
these
restrictions
never
could
be
constitutional,
no
matter
what
the
facts
were.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
staver,
is
everything
you've
said
about
petitioner
madsen
equally
true
as
to
the
other
named
petitioners?
none
of
them
were
found
to
have
violated
the
earlier
injunction?
none
of
them
were
active
at
this
particular
clinic
demonstration?
unknown
speaker
your
comments
have
all
been
directed
to
petitioner
madsen,
but
i
want
to
be
clear
about
the
other
named
petitioners
as
well.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
proceeding
at
which
this
testimony
was
taken?
unknown
speaker
at
a
motion
to
hold
martin
in
contempt?
unknown
speaker
and
martin
was
one
of
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
staver,
i
must
say,
you
have
me
thoroughly
confused.
you
say
you're
challenging
this
injunction
as
applied
to
judy
madsen,
but
you
also
say
it
has
not
yet
been
applied
to
judy
madsen.
how
can
you
challenge
it
as
applied
when
it
hasn't
been
applied?
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
she's
restrained.
maybe
she's
not.
do
we
know
that
she's...
how
do
we
know
that
she's
restrained?
you
tell
us
that
she's
covered
by
the
in-concert.
we
don't
know
that
she's
covered
by
the
in-concert
until
someone
says,
judy
madsen,
you're
covered
by
the
in-concert
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
seems
to
me
not
an
as-applied-to-judy-madsen
point.
that
seems
to
me
a
facial
challenge.
unknown
speaker
your
contention
is
you
can't
use
the
terms,
in-concert?
i
don't
know
how
you
can
issue
an
injunction
that's
effective
unless
it
applies
not
just
to
the
people
it's
directed
at
but
to
anyone
acting
in
concert
with
them.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
"in
concert"
cannot
be
used
in
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
that?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
those
people
in
front
of
us.
it's
just...
your
argument
is
so
confusing,
because
we
don't
have
people
here
that
have
been
found
in
contempt,
so
i
don't
know
why
we
aren't
just
looking
at
this
facially.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
parts
of
this
injunction
that
you
say
are
okay.
maybe
we
should
clarify
that
by
looking
at
the
appendix.
you
say
you're
not
challenging
every
part
of
this
current
injunction.
can
you...
by
pointing
us
to
the
joint
appendix,
which
parts
are
you
saying
you're
not
challenging,
are
okay?
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me
where
in
the
petitioner...
the
appendix--
unknown
speaker
--so
that's
what
you're
saying...
you
are
challenging
this
new
injunction
wholesale.
the
only
thing
that
you're
saying
is
okay
is
what
was
repeated
from
the
first
injunction.
unknown
speaker
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
section
(4)
is
limited
to
that,
as
far
as
sound
goes...
other
sounds
within
earshot
of
the
patients
inside
the
clinic.
i
read
(4)
as
saying
you
only
can't
make
such
noise
as
would
penetrate
the
clinic.
you
don't
contend
that's
unreasonable,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
a
vagueness
challenge
to
(4).
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
contest
that
they
can
prevent
people
from
making
so
much
noise
that
it
annoys
patients
at
the
clinic,
inside
the
clinic.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
have
an
objection--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
don't
have
an
objection
to
the
injunction
against
using
a
bullhorn.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
staver.
mr.
d'alemberte.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
the
blocking
of
access,
mr.
d'alemberte?
unknown
speaker
did
they
specifically
stop
cars
from
going
in?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
part
when
cars
came
up?
unknown
speaker
i
watched
the
videotape.
it
seemed
to
me
they
parted
when
the
cars
came
up.
unknown
speaker
is
that
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
--into
the
car?
unknown
speaker
the
testimony
is
that...
well.
unknown
speaker
mr.
d'alemberte,
there
was
a
case
that
didn't
come
to
this
court
but
that
was
once
very
much
in
the
news,
and
it
was
the
skokie
case,
where
the
argument
was
made
that
the
people
that
would
be
subjected
to
this
demonstration,
because
of
their
peculiar
condition,
would
be
certainly
psychologically
upset
and
even
physically
sick.
do
i
take
it
from
your
argument
that
you
disagree
with
the
lower
court's
disposition?
unknown
speaker
whose
testimony
are
you
relying
on?
how
many
items
of
testimony?
is
it
not
the
testimony
of
one
doctor?
unknown
speaker
one
doctor
at
the
abortion
clinic,
correct?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
what
opposing
testimony
would
you
have
expected
to
be
introduced?
unknown
speaker
so
no...
any
speech
can
be
prohibited
if
it
affects
people's
vital
signs,
encourages
them
to
be
upset
and
may
place
their
health
at
risk,
is
that...
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--if
i
have
a
heart
condition,
can
i
carry
a
sign
on
me
which
says,
heart
condition,
do
not
upset
me--
[laughter]
--and
the
court
can
issue
an
injunction
that
people
shall
not
approach
me
unless
i
invite
them
to?
unknown
speaker
what
does
stalking
mean?
does
it
mean
walking
after
them?
unknown
speaker
following
closely
and
saying
nasty
things
to
them?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
gone
near
a
picket
line
around
a
strike-bound
plant?
unknown
speaker
and
been
called
a
strike-breaker?
unknown
speaker
you've
heard
other
people--
[laughter]
all
of
these
things
are...
this
is
wide,
robust,
wide-open
debate
you're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
be
stalked
by
people
who
want
to
say
nasty
things
to
you.
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
building
of
doctor's
offices?
would
the
same
thing
apply
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
before
you
get
into
that,
would
your
heart-beat
test
apply
to
an
abortion
counseling
facility
where
there
is
just
counseling
of
women?
there
are
no
abortion
procedures
undertaken
there.
that's
at
some
other
clinic.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
specific
finding
here
that
it
was
because
of
the
treatment--
unknown
speaker
--that
it
was
necessary
to
have
this
injunction?
unknown
speaker
you
talked
about
a
gauntlet,
and
you
said
they
were
swarming,
they
were
thrusting--
unknown
speaker
--i
did
not
see
this
in
the
videotape.
i
looked
at
the
videotape,
and
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
rather
orderly
demonstration,
given
the
emotions
and
the
philosophic
differences
between
these
people.
unknown
speaker
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--mr.--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
agree
that
the
named
petitioners
here
were
not
found
in
contempt?
unknown
speaker
you
think
they
were
found--
unknown
speaker
--where
in
the...
is
it
in
the
joint--
unknown
speaker
--where
is
it
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
b-5?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event,
there's
no
finding
by
name
of
these
three.
unknown
speaker
do
we
then
have,
in
your
view,
just
a
facial
challenge
here?
is
that
what
we
have
to
address?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
if
we
have
that,
address,
if
you
would,
for
a
few
minutes
in
your
argument
what
standard
we
employ
to
test
the
validity
of
an
injunction
like
this.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
where
we've
applied
time,
place,
and
manner
tests
to
injunctions.
maybe
we
should,
but
i
don't
know
that
we
ever
have,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
test
is.
some
amici
have
said
it
must
be
a
stricter
test
than
the
ordinary
time,
place,
and
manner.
how
do
we
test
out
the
provisions
in
front
of
us
on
a
facial
challenge?
unknown
speaker
a
statute
applies
to
everybody,
mr.
d'alemberte.
when
a
legislature
says
nobody
shall
annoy
people
going
into
hospitals,
a
36-foot
quiet
zone
around
a
hospital,
nobody,
no
matter
what
their
cause,
shall
be
in
there.
it's
even-handed.
unknown
speaker
an
injunction
applies
to
one
group
and
says,
this
group
shall
not
be
within
36
feet
of
a
hospital.
you
don't
see
any
difference
between
those
two
situations?
unknown
speaker
mr.
d'alemberte--
unknown
speaker
--they
have
conceded
that
section
(2)
of
the
injunction,
which
prevents
them
from
in
any
manner
obstructing
or
interfering
with
access
to
the
clinic
is
okay.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
contested.
unknown
speaker
section
(2)
is
in
the
injunction,
too.
it
says,
you
do
that,
you're
going
to
go
to
jail.
unknown
speaker
that's
all
right.
they
don't
object
to
that.
unknown
speaker
they've
gotten
wiser.
they
don't
object
to
it
now.
unknown
speaker
mr.
d'alemberte--
unknown
speaker
--i'd
like
to
go
back
to
this
point
about
the
difference
between
the
statute
and
injunction,
and
call
your
attention
specifically
to
the
point
that
was
made
in
one
of
the
many
amici
briefs
in
this
case.
this
was
the
one
on
behalf
of
the
cio...
afl-cio,
and
it
was
that
a
statute
of
general
application
has
little
danger
of
censoring
one
set
of
ideas
or
speakers
but
not
others,
where
an
injunction
by
its
very
nature
homes
in
on
a
particular
group
of
speakers,
so
there
can
be
a
suspicion.
you
gave
the
example
of
quiet
around
hospitals,
but
that's
not
what
this
regulation
is.
it's
quiet
around
this
particular
clinic,
directed
to
a
particular
group
of
speakers.
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
prochoice
speaker
would
be
subject
to
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
so
these
defendants
were
enjoined
from
making
any
sort
of
speech
of
any
kind,
whether
prolife
or
prochoice?
unknown
speaker
and
you
consider
that
content-neutral,
just
as
a...
it's...
an
injunction
against
a
labor
union
is
content-neutral
because
it
also
prevents
the
labor
union
from
saying,
don't
join
the
union,
right,
so
it's
not--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i--
--mr.
d'alemberte--
unknown
speaker
--with
respect,
mr.
d'alemberte,
de
facto,
any
injunction
against
a
labor
union
or
against
this
group
is
content-directed,
de
facto
it
is.
you
may
say
in
theory
the
union
can
come
out
for
the
employer,
but
that's
not--
unknown
speaker
--what
it's
all
about.
you
know
what
kind
of
speech
you're
stopping.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
take
their
chance--
unknown
speaker
--they
take
their
chance
at
being
considered
in
concert.
i
mean,
if
you
walk
up...
you
know,
a
policeman
say,
he
looks
to
me
like
he's
in...
have
ever
heard
of
chilling
effect?
unknown
speaker
mr.
d'alemberte,
may
i
ask
you
just
some
factual
background
that
would
relate
to
the
300-foot
zone
around
the
house?
if
we
were
to
follow
the
suggestion
of
the
afl-cio
and
apply
something
like
the
carroll
standard,
at
the
very
least
we
would
require
that
before
there
was
a
restriction,
an
injunction
restricting
speech,
there
would
have
to
have
been
demonstration
that
an
injunction
relating
to
action
only
had
been
inadequate.
was
there
any
prior
injunction
with
respect
to
activities
at
the
residences
of
the
clients?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
what
happened
at
the
residences,
other
than
the
incident
about
the
individuals
going
to
the
nurse's
house
when
the
children
were
at
home?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
indication
that
any
conduct
at
the
residences
which
were
subject
to
this
300-foot
injunction
was
unlawful?
was
there
any
allegation
of
an
unlawful
act
committed?
unknown
speaker
any
statute,
or
any
injunction.
unknown
speaker
so
there'd
been
nothing
except
lawful
but
annoying
actions?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
d'alemberte.
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
case
in
which
a
challenged
injunction
was
judged
by
the
time,
place,
and
manner
standard?
unknown
speaker
yes,
which
wasn't
a
case,
really,
but
was--
unknown
speaker
--the
opinions
of
separate
justices.
unknown
speaker
specifically,
why
not
the
carroll
standard?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
are
any
special
dangers
that
attend
the
use
of
injunctions
to
prohibit
this
conduct
that
do
not
attend
the
enactment
of
a
criminal
statute?
unknown
speaker
the
punishment
would
be
different,
too,
wouldn't
it?
punishment
for
contempt
can
be
a
good
deal
more
summary
than
a
criminal
indictment
and
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
just
the
point?
unknown
speaker
it
has
flexibility
because
it
can
be
applied
to
some
parties
and
not
to
others,
and
isn't
that...
i
use
the
word
"danger"...
a
significant
concern
where
free
speech
is
at
issue?
unknown
speaker
yes,
there
has
to
be
an
ability,
but
doesn't
that
ability
have
to
be
accompanied
by
a
special
solicitude
for
free
speech
rights
because
certain
persons
are
being
singled
out,
which
is
not
the
case
of
a
statute,
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
your
argument
where
you've
acknowledged
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
days,
we're
not
dealing
with
an
abstract
question
now.
we
have...
don't
we
have
a
long
history
in
this
country
of
enjoining
labor
unions,
of
enjoining
all
kinds
of
political
protesters,
students
in
the
sixties,
civil
rights
marchers?
doesn't
that
caution
particular
care
in
dealing
with
injunctions,
rather
than
a
lighter
brand
of
review
than
one
we
would
apply
to
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
the...
what
should
i
say?
what
prompts
the
injunction
is
conduct,
but
what
the
injunction
is
directed
to
is
not
only
conduct
but
attempted
speech,
and
i
assume
that,
you
know,
in
some
cases
that
can
be
justified
if
there's
been
a
history
of
violence
on
the
picket
line,
you
can
simply
say
okay,
we've
given
you
guys
a
chance.
you
had
a
prior
injunction,
you
ignored
it.
no
picket
line.
you
just
can't
be
trusted.
but
you
know,
it
isn't
the
conduct
that's
being
enjoined
any
more,
it's
speech
that's
being
enjoined
because
of
prior
conduct.
now,
do
you
acknowledge
that
that's
what's
involved
here?
unknown
speaker
or
do
you
think
the
speech
itself
is
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
intimidated
or
harassed?
do
you
mean,
seeking
to
give
them
leaflets?
unknown
speaker
calling
them
names?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
as
calling
names
is
designed
to
hurt.
calling
president
nixon,
to
speak
of
recent
events,
a
murderer
as
happened
in
demonstrations
when
the
vietnam
war
was
in
progress
is
designed
to
hurt.
does
that
make
it
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
saying
that
it
would
be
constitutionally
protected
conduct
to
follow
someone
around
day
after
day
after
day,
calling
him
a
murderer
and
a
baby
killer
and
so
forth,
just...
everywhere
he
went,
a
person
could
follow
him
and
keep
repeating
the
same
message
over
and
over?
would
that
be
constitutionally
protected?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
in
effect
saying
that
there
does
have
to
be
at
least
a
predicate
threat
of
illegal
conduct?
unknown
speaker
so...
well,
the
only
reason
i
ask,
in
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
when
you
said
that
that
might
raise
the...
might
rise
to
the
level
of
an
assault
or
a
threat
of
harm,
i
thought
you
were
saying
those
would
in
fact
be
criminal
offenses
and
they
would
be
the
predicate
for
the
injunction
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
that
is
not
what
you
meant?
you
may
answer
the
question.
unknown
speaker
but
that
they
are
not
a
necessary
predicate.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
days.
unknown
speaker
mr.
staver,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
that
if
she
had
been
the
president
of
operation
rescue
and
said,
i
believe
in
everything
they're
doing
and
i
want
to
help
them
as
much
as
i
can,
there'd
be
a
different
result?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
asking
you,
if
she
were,
if
she
said,
i
agree
with
everything
they
do,
i
want
to
help
them
as
much
as
i
can,
would
she
then
lose
her...
the
rights
you're
describing?
unknown
speaker
then
i
don't
really
understand
what
difference
it
makes
if
you've
got
judy
madsen
rather
than
the
president
of
the
organization.
