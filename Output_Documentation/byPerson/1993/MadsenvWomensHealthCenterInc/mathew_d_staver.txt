mr.
mathew
d.
staver
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
neither
judy
madsen,
ed
martin,
nor
shirley
hobbs
surrender
their
constitutional
rights
to
free
speech
when
they
enter
the
speech
free
zone
surrounding
the
aware
clinic.
this
case
is
about
the
right
to
peacefully
display
a
sign
and
distribute
literature
in
a
traditional
public
forum.
petitioners
do
not
seek
to
trespass
or
blockade,
nor
are
those
portions
of
the
injunction
challenged
here
today.
in
a
nonpublic
forum,
this
court
noted
that
one
need
not
ponder
the
contents
of
a
pamphlet
or
leaflet
in
order
to
mechanically
take
it
from
someone's
hand.
despite
this
court's
holding,
the
injunction
totally
bans
literature
distribution.
this
court
recognized
in
bray
and
in
casey
that
men
and
women
of
good
conscience
have
common
and
respectable
reasons
for
opposing
abortion.
indeed,
abortion
speech,
or
speech
about
abortion
lies
at
the
very
core
of
the
first
amendment.
if
the
first
amendment
really
means
that
speech
must
be
uninhibited,
robust,
and
wide
open,
the
injunction
must
be
dissolved.
the
injunction
violates
petitioner's
right
to
free
speech
because
it
is
both
viewpoint-based
and
a
prior
restraint,
and
because
it
lacks
precision.
viewpoint-based
regulations
like
prior
restraints
come
to
this
court
with
a
heavy
presumption
against
their
constitutional
validity.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
why
it's
viewpoint-based
is,
judy
madsen
is
restrained
once
she
enters
the
300-foot
buffer
zone.
when
she
enters
that
zone,
she
can
only
speak
if
the
listener
favorably
reacts
to
that
speech.
when
she
enters
this
zone,
the
injunction
states
that
she
can
only
speak
if
someone
approaches
her,
extends
a
hand,
or
she
can
continue
to
speak
only
if
they
show
a
positive
interest
in
what
she
has
to
say.
also,
the
injunction
is
specifically
addressing
judy
madsen's
speech,
which
in
context
is
more
than
activities
which
it
restrains,
but
goes
to
speech.
judy
madsen's
speech
at
the
abortion
clinic
is
clearly
on
the
issue
of
abortion.
judy
madsen
had
not
been
to
this
clinic
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
injunction.
now
when
she
enters
the
speech-free
zones--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
we
do.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
the
reason
is,
is
that
judy
madsen
cannot
ever
enter
that
zone,
whereas
other
individuals
expressing
a
contrary
view
can.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
justice
o'connor,
it
wouldn't
be
viewpoint-based
on
every
injunction.
this
injunction,
for
example,
in
sections
(1)
and
(2)
would
clearly
not
be
viewpoint-based.
those
restrain
activities
which
we
don't
challenge,
but
the
injunction
the
way
it
was
drafted
and
the
way--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--your
honor,
on...
justice
o'connor,
on
page
24
of
the
respondent's
brief,
they
specifically
address
the
types
of
images
that
would
be
impermissible
under
this
injunction.
they
state
that
the
images
that
would
be
impermissible
are
those
that
tend
to
traumatize.
who
makes
that
determination
but
the
listener's
reaction
to
speech,
and
the
listener's
reaction
to
speech
could
never
be
a
content-neutral
basis
for
regulating
an
individual's--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
raise
the
vagueness
challenge
as
well
as
a
viewpoint-base
challenge,
and
i
believe
in
this
particular
case,
looking
at
justice...
or
judge
mcgregor,
who
drafted
this
injunction,
he
clearly
stated
that
it
applies
to
a
belief,
not
specifically
activities
or
individuals.
it
applies
to
those
beliefs
that
seem
to
be
supportive
of
prolife.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
not
the
basis
of
the
challenge.
the
basis
is
that
in
the
internal
workings
of
the
injunction
itself,
it
says
that
when
someone
enters
this
zone...
for
example,
judy
madsen...
she
can
only
speak
if
that
individual
listener
shows
a
positive
interest
in
what
she
has
to
say.
that
listener,
therefore,
is
empowered
with
ex
parte
adjunctive
authority
to
censor
her
speech.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
justice
scalia,
the
36-foot
zone
would
be
the
same
way.
the
way
judge
mcgregor
intended
and
applied
that
36--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--she
can't
ever
go
within
that
zone.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
she
can't
go
in
at
all.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
because
of...
the
only
reason
she
can't
go
in
has
nothing
to
do
with
her
activities
but
solely
because
of
her
belief.
judge
mcgregor--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--i
believe
it
is,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
well,
in
the
sections
(1)
and
(2)--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--sections
(3)
through
(9)
would
be
the
content-based.
sections
(1)
and
(2)
i
would
say
would
not
be,
because
that
simply
restrains
an
activity
and
not
individual
speech,
which
we
are
not
challenging.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that's
true
in
part,
justice
souter,
but
outside
of
the
36-foot
zone,
for
example,
judy
madsen
could
not
raise
her
voice
to
reach
somebody
within
the
zone
because
that
could
be
heard.
she
could
not
display
an
image,
for
that
could
be
seen.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
that's
not
true,
justice
souter.
going
on
further,
at
the
end
of
the
injunction,
it
speaks
about
the
invited
contact
portion.
it
says
that
that
portion--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--i'm
reading
right
now
on
the
joint
appendix,
page
63,
which
is
also
reproduced
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
cert,
but
it's
on
the
last
page
of
the
injunction,
just
before
the
signature
blocks.
it
speaks
about
invited
contact,
and
it
begins
with,
ordered
and
adjudged.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
yes.
it's
reproduced
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
and
it's
also
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
in
that
section,
justice
souter,
it
speaks
about
invited
contact,
and
that
invited
contact
portion
applies
outside
of
the
36-foot
zone.
it
calls
it
the
buffer
zone.
section
(3)
is
the
only
place
within
the
injunction
that
refers
to
a
buffer
zone,
so
the
invited
contact
applies
outside
of
the
zone,
which
would
be
in
that
300-foot
zone.
it
says
that
judy
madsen
would
not
be
able
to
speak
if
someone
didn't
have
a
positive
interest
in
what
she
had
to
say,
nor
could
she
distribute
literature--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--yes.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
cert,
justice
souter,
it
is
on
page
b-11.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
at
the
bottom,
and
it
begins
with,
ordered
and
adjudged.
it's
the
second
ordered
and
adjudged
on
that
page.
it
says,
"at
all
times
on
all
days,
respondents
will
have
the
right
of
invited
contact
with
persons
protected
hereby
so
long
as
it
is
outside
the
clinic
buffer
zone.
"
which
is
the
36-foot
zone.
""invited
contact"
is
defined
as
conduct
by
the
person
sought
to
be
contacted
which
affirmatively
indicates
a
desire
to
engage
in
conversation
or
to
receive
literature.
"
"such
affirmative
indication
may
include
where
the
person
sought
to
be
contacted
physically
approaches
a
respondent
or
where
such
person
extends
his
or
her
hand
to
receive
literature,
or
speaks
words
indicating
a
positive
interest
in
what
the
respondent
is
saying.
"
it
goes
on
down--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--justice
souter,
the
next
sentence
goes
down
and
basically
says
such
invited
contact
by
a
person
protected
hereby
as
it
relates
to
conduct...
contact
at
such
person's
residence
is
limited
to
conduct
transmitted
by
the
resident
to
a
respondent
at
a
distance
from
and
at
a
time
prior
to
the
contact,
so
that--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--that's--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--justice
souter,
i
believe
that
when
judy
madsen
enters
this
36-foot
zone,
she--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--i'm
sorry,
the--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--i'm
sorry...
the
300-foot
zone.
she
could
not
approach
an
individual
if
they
didn't
show
some
positive
interest
in
her.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that's
exactly
right.
prior
consent
equals
prior--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--they
can't...
but
they
couldn't
physically
approach
if
they're
simply
there
with
literature
within
the
300-foot
zone.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
justice
ginsbug,
let
me
answer
both
questions,
and
looking
at
the
second
one
first,
there
is
no
conceded
violation
of
the
first
injunction.
on
page
375
of
the
joint
appendix,
respondents
specifically
stated
that
the
contempt
proceedings
regarding
any
violations
of
the
1992
had
nothing
to
do
with
judy
madsen.
on
page
436,
the
judge
said,
i
understand
that,
and
that's
why
judy
madsen
never
testified.
but
going
to
the
first...
the...
question
second,
there
were
no
requests
specifically
for
modification
on
the
1993.
there
was
a
request
to
dissolve
the
temporary
restraining
order
back
in
1991
and
1992.
that
was
denied.
right
after
the
entry
of
this
'93
injunction
was
the
only
time
that
arrest
occurred,
and
it
wasn't
petitioners.
it
was
those
individuals
penetrating
the
zone.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
yes,
she
was,
justice
scalia.
she
was
not
at
the
clinic.
her
name...
the
reason
why
she
is
here--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
not
at
the
aware
clinic,
justice
scalia.
in
fact,
her
name
appeared--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--i
don't
believe
that
she
really
could,
and
i
believe
that
it
would
have
bee
futile
to
do
that,
because
judge
mcgregor,
a
few
days
after
this
injunction
was
entered,
made
all
of
the
statements
that
are
before
this
court
about
how
he
interpreted
this
injunction.
he
said
it
applied
to
anybody
who
seemed
to
be
supportive
of
prolife.
if
you
had
notice
of
the
injunction,
penetrated
the
zone,
36-foot
zone,
and
were
prolife,
you
were
hauled
off
to
jail.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
justice
ginsburg,
it's
certainly
not
valid
as
it
relates
to
the
three
petitioners.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
not,
because
that
would
not
give
full
relief
to
judy
madsen,
because
she
would
be
like
myrna
cheffer
before
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
by
simply
penetrating
the
36-foot
zone,
she
would
be
considered
to
act
in
concert.
so
we
bring
both
an
as-applied
and
a
facial
challenge
to
the
overbreadth
of
how
the
judge...
not
pursuant
to
rule
65,
but
how
the
judge
crafted
and
applied
the
in-concert
section.
he
clearly
tried
to
restrain
a
belief.
he
clearly
tries
to
require
prior
consent
before
even
distributing
pieces
of
literature,
and
prior
consent
would
be--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--a
prior
restraint.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
she
was
not
in
concert,
and
as
a
matter
of
law--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--that
she
was
in
concert?
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
there
is
a
finding
of
fact
in
the
1992
generically
lumping
all
of
the
people
together,
but
in
the
1993
injunction,
justice
stevens,
there's
no
finding--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--not
in
the
1993
injunction.
it
never--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--no.
she
could
be
held
in
concert,
justice
stevens,
if
she
were
really
actively
aiding
and
abetting
those
named
in
the
injunction,
but
that's
not
how
the
judge
intended
to
apply
the
in-concert.
he
commanded
that
a
traffic
sign
be
erected
that
simply
said,
warning,
demonstrations
and
picketing
in
this
area
are
limited
by
court
order.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
she
has
in
the
1993,
but
not
guilty
as
terms
of
criminal,
no.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
she
was
never
cited
for
contempt,
never
arrested.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
the
1993
injunction
is
the
sanction
of
not
being
able
to
speak.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
she
has
not.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
this
court
has
come
to
it,
because
we
don't
have
to
speculate
as
to
how
far
the
in-concert
section
goes.
in
fact,
we
have
an
unusual
record
where
we
see
the
judge's
comments
about
how
he
applied
it.
secondly,
we
have
the
city
police
who
were
enforcing
the
injunction
asking
the
judge
to
clarify,
and
that
did
come
up,
justice
ginsburg,
about
the
police
enforcers
wanting
to
clarify
whether
that
was
proper
to
arrest
anybody
who
penetrated
the
zone.
the
judge
denied
their
motion
to
clarify,
and
that
motion
was
opposed
by
the
clinic.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
justice
ginsburg,
we've
argued
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
also
to
this
court
that
it's
as
applied
to
judy
madsen
factually
and
on
its
face
as
well,
and
in
fact
the
same
evidence
that's
before
this
court
was
before
the
court
of
florida,
and
the
same
arguments
were
made,
and
we
asked
them
to
de
novo
review
this
case.
the
only
pieces
of
testimony
that
were
not
before
the
florida
supreme
court
was
that
of
arick,
doyle,
and
wymer,
but
respondents
specifically
stated
that
testimony
had
nothing
to
do
with
petitioners.
this
particular
court,
as
well
as
the
florida
supreme
court,
had
the
testimony
of
april
12th,
the
record
and
the
comments
by
judge
mcgregor,
and
all
the
testimony
that
was
before
this
particular
court
except
for
those
other
three
testimonies,
so
the
record
evidence,
looking
at
it
de
novo,
does
not
show
that
the
injunction
was
constitutionally
applied
properly
to
the
three
petitioners.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
let
me
explain
that
statement.
petitioner--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--yes.
petitioner
madsen
nor
hobbs
testified,
because
there
was
no
allegations
against
them.
petitioner
martin
did
testify.
there
were
two
allegations.
however,
there
was
never
a
finding
of
contempt.
there
was
only
the
motion...
there
was
only
the
modification
of
the
1993
injunction.
the
1993
injunction
never
names
any
of
petitioners
or
rescue
america
by
name.
in
respect
to
petitioner
martin,
the
two
allegations
against
him
were,
number
1)
did
he
on
one
occasion
stand
in
front
of
a
doctor's
car
and
move
after
the
doctor
honked
the
horn,
and
secondly,
did
he
distribute
a
brochure
that
was
published
prior
to
the
1992
injunction
after
that
injunction?
first,
if
he
were
there
on
this
occasion,
which
he
denies,
that
wouldn't
constitute
blocking.
secondly,
if
he
did
distribute
the
brochure,
which
he
denies,
it
doesn't
incite
anyone
to
illegal
activity.
he
specifically
disclaimed
blocking
access
to
a
clinic--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--this
was
at
a
proceeding,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
a
motion
to
contempt,
and
a
motion
to
modify.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
motion
to
hold
all
the
defendants
named
in
the
1992
injunction
in
contempt.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that's
correct.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
what
i
mean
by
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that
she
is
presently
restrained.
she
has
not
been
found
in
contempt,
and
so
it's
not
applied
in
that
particular
sense.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
as
far
as
the
in-concert
provision,
we
don't
know
that
for
a
fact,
but
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
the
broad
breadth
of
this
in
concert,
because
we
know
that
2
days
after
this
injunction
all
these
others
were
arrested
for
simply
penetrating
the
zone,
who
were
not
in
concert.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that's
exactly
right.
that's
the
section
that
we're
bringing
as
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
justice
scalia,
let
me
explain.
the
336-foot
zone.
the
in-concert
section
is
the
only
thing
that
would
be
facially,
so
if
you
excise
judy
madsen
out,
she
would
find
herself
in
the
same
position
as
the
myrna
cheffer
in
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
case,
not
being
able
to
penetrate
the
zone.
but
at
any
rate,
this
particular
injunction
certainly
restrains
her
speech
by
restricting
her
access
in
this
300-foot
zone.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
it
certainly
can,
if
it's
used
properly
according
to
this
court's
decision
in
chase.
in
chase,
this
court
looked
at
how
an
in-concert
application
could
be
used,
and
that
it
should
not
be
used
to
attempt
to
restrain
the
entire
world
who
simply
receives
notice
of
an
injunction,
but
it
should
be
used
if
proof
was
shown
that
someone
was
actively
in
concert,
aiding
and
abetting.
how
the
judge
applied
this,
though,
was
to
restrain
the
entire
world.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
we
know
it
from
the
april
12
transcript,
where
the
judge
brought
individuals
who
simply
penetrated
the
zone.
on
page
68
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
judge--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--justice
o'connor,
even
aside
from
the
in-concert,
that's
not
the
basis
of
the
argument.
the
basis
of
the
argument
is
that
originally
this
injunction
should
never
have
been
applied
against
judy
madsen.
this
court
could
not--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--we
would
not
challenge
page
57,
sections
(1)
and
(2).
that
section
would
prohibit
blocking
access
to
the
clinic.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that's
joint
appendix,
volume
1,
page
57,
in
the
joint
appendix.
that's
sections
(1)
and
(2),
and
that
is
a
reiteration,
actually,
of
the
1992
injunction
verbatim.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
well,
no,
we
would
also
not
challenge
the
jamming
phone
that
is
part
of
this
injunction.
we
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
a
constitutional
right
to
call
somebody's
phone
and
jam
up
their
phones.
section
(4)
is
the
sound
limitation.
we
do
challenge
parts
of
that.
parts
of
that
section
(4)
on
the
sound
and
images
limitation
specifically
prohibits
the
use
of
bullhorns.
we
would
not
challenge
a
clearly
defined
volume
restriction
which
would
protect
the
interest
of
the
clinic
as
well
as
sections
(1)
and
(2),
but
we
do
challenge
a
prohibition
on
the
making
of
any
sound,
or
the
display
of
any
image.
in
this
particular
injunction,
someone
who
would
be
singing
outside
of
the
36-foot
zone,
if
that
could
be
heard
within
the
clinic,
would
violate
the
injunction.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
we
wouldn't
contend
that
that's
unreasonable,
but
this
particular
section
speaks
about
the
time
limitations
that
these
restrictions
apply.
it
says
it
applies
from
7:30
a.m.
to
noon,
mondays
through
saturdays,
during
surgical
procedures
and
recovery
periods.
we
don't
know
when
surgical
procedures
or
recovery
periods
are,
and
it's
not
our
interpretation,
it's
respondents'
as
well,
because
on
pages
79
or
so
of
the
joint
appendix,
they
specifically
requested
that
that
term
be
specified
so
that
they
would
know
when
the
surgery
and
recovery
periods
are.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that's
a
vagueness
challenge,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no.
we
wouldn't
contest
that,
justice
scalia.
what
we
would
contest,
though,
is
the
limitation
on
sound.
if
it
simply
said
you
can't
intentionally
shout
to
disturb
this
clinic,
or
to
use
sound
amplification
devices,
we
would
have
no
problem
with
that
kind
of
a
reasonably
defined--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--broad
restriction.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
we
would
not,
justice
souter.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
an
injunction,
de
facto,
is
content-based.
the
carroll
standard
is
the
applicable
standard.
to
apply
the
time,
place,
and
manner
standard
would
result
in
the
overruling
of
more
than
60
years
of
this
court's
precedent,
beginning
in
1931
with
near.
the
standard
applicable
to
this
case
is
that
an
injunction
touching
on
free
speech
is
a
prior
restraint
which
carries
a
heavy
presumption
against
constitutional
validity
and
which
must
be
precisely
tailored
to
the
exact
needs
of
the
case.
that
standard
is
totally
inapposite
to
a
time,
place,
and
manner
standard
precisely
because
it
focuses
on
someone's
speech,
in
this
case
petitioner's
prior
to
her
or
them
being
able
to
speak
their
speech.
it
criminalizes
their
side
of
the
debate.
this
particular
case
is
certainly
coming
to
this
court
with
a
heavy
presumption
against
constitutional
validity.
it
is
a
touchstone
of
first
amendment
regulation
to
be
very
precise,
not
overkill.
this
injunction
is
overkill.
as
in
claiborne
hardware,
that
injunction
was
overkill.
as
in
near,
that
injunction
was
a
prior
restraint.
this
injunction,
instead
of
using
a
surgeon's
scalpel,
cuts
with
a
butcher's
knife.
this
injunction
restrains
judy
madsen's
speech
from
being
able
to
distribute
a
piece
of
literature
which
is
not
offensive
or
distressing
to
anyone
forever,
within
the
36-foot
zone.
judy
madsen
can
never
lawfully
be
present
on
a
public
sidewalk,
public
highway,
or
right-of-way,
period,
under
this
injunction.
judy
madsen
must
censor
her
speech
when
she
goes
within
the
36-foot
zone.
despite
page
375
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
respondent
specifically
said,
judy
madsen
had
never
been
a
target
of
the
contempt
proceedings,
yet
she's
still
a
part
of
this
injunction.
the
clinic
and
the
court
below
impermissibly
lumped
her
protected
speech
with
some
other
unknown--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--if
she
were,
justice
stevens,
condoning
and
orchestrating
this?
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
she
was
not
a
target
of
the
contempt
in
any
respect.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
i
believe
on
page
920
of
this
court's
decision
in
claiborne
hardware,
it
says
that
to
restrain
those
illegal
activities
for
individuals,
not
simply
because
they're
members
of
a
group.
judy
madsen
did
no
illegal
activity.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
