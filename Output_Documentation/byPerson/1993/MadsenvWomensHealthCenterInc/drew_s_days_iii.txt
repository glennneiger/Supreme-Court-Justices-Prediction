mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
contrast
to
a
statute
or
ordinance,
a
court
order
properly
addresses
the
particular
conduct
that
is
before
the
court
and
is
properly
confined
to
addressing
that
conduct.
consequently,
we
think
the
question
before
the
court
presented
here
is
whether
the
1993
amended
permanent
injunction
properly
addressed
the
particular
conduct
before
that
court,
and
properly
confined
itself
to
addressing
that
conduct
within
constitutional
limits.
this
is
a
situation
where
judge
mcgregor
found
that
the
1992
injunction
was
inadequate
to
protect
the
interests
of
persons
associated
with
the
clinic,
and
that
was
not...
that
was
an
injunction
that
was
not
challenged.
i
think
the
record
also
shows
some
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
judge
to
modify
that
injunction,
but
once
he
did,
it
was
because
he
had
heard
3
days
of
evidence
in
that
regard.
the
constitutional
limits
with
respect
to
injunctions,
we
would
submit,
are
those
imposed
by
this
court
with
respect
to
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we
do
not
have
any
additional
case
to
the
one
that
mr.
d'alemberte
cited,
the
hirsh
v.
city
of
atlanta.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we're
here--
[laughter]
--because
we
think
that's
what
the
court
should
be
doing
in
this
respect.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
why
not
the
carroll
standard?
because
i
think
that
first
of
all
it
depends
on
what
part
of
the
1993
injunction
you're
addressing.
you
were
talking
about
the
residential
picketing
provision.
but
i
think
to
pick
up
on
something
that
my
colleague
said,
we're
talking
about
not
just
a
medical
facility,
we're
talking
about
conditions
where
interference
with
the
ability
of
women
to
get
to
the
clinic
and
get
the
services
that
the
clinic
provides
would
cause
them
irreparable
harm.
this
is
not
a
provision
that
would
apply
across
the
board
to
medical
facilities,
although
i
think
it
is
true
that
medical
facilities
are
not
factories,
mines,
or
assembly
plants,
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
said,
but
no,
i
think
a
court
looking
at
the
situation
has
the
power
to
enjoin
certain
behavior
that
poses
a
threat
to
people
in
violation
of
rights
that
are
protected
under
state
or
federal
law,
and
that's
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
wouldn't...
justice
kennedy,
i
wouldn't
call
them
special
dangers.
i
think
that
it's
simply
that
the
mode
of
analysis,
the
evidence
that
the
court
would
look
at
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
that
imposed
time,
place,
or
manner
restrictions
would
be
different
from
the
type
of
evidence
that
the
court
would
look
at
in
dealing
with
an
injunction.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
true,
but
i
think
it's
also
the
case
that
an
injunction
has
more
flexibility.
that
is,
the
court
can
look
at
the
situation
and
make
modifications
to
the
extent
that
they
overreach--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--with
respect
to
the
particular
problem.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it's
certainly
a
matter
of
concern,
but
i
think
that
unless
the
court
is
going
to
prohibit
courts
from
issuing
injunctions
under
circumstances
like
these,
there
has
to
be
some
ability
of
the
courts
to
address
problems
like
those
presented
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
first
of
all,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
it
is
possible
for
even
statutes
to
deal
with
particular
problems
that
may
fall
more
heavily
on
one
group
than
another,
but
once
again,
what
the
court
would
do
is
try
to
determine
whether
the
legislative
body
that
enacted
the
statute
or
ordinance
was
responding
to
an
actual
evil.
that
would
be
the
analysis.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
applying
the
fair
education
association
time,
place,
or
manner
approach
is
perfectly
suitable
and
sufficient
for
situations
of
this
kind.
i
don't
agree
with
the
afl-cio
that
there
has
to
be
something
you
might
call
a
time,
place,
manner
plus
test.
i
simply
think
that,
given
this
type
of
situation,
the
court
can
look
at
the
evidence.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i'm
not
suggesting
a
lighter
brand.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
the
same
approach
that's
used
with
respect
to
statutes
ought
to
be
adopted
by
this
court,
but
the
evidence
that
is
considered
is
different,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
any
reason
to
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
heavier
test
under
these
circumstances.
what
this
particular
case
establishes
is
that
the
conduct
is
the
purpose...
is
the
objective
of
the
injunction.
it's
not
directed
at
content
of
the
petitioner's
speech,
but
rather
to
conduct
that
the
trial
court
found--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
certainly
the
restriction--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--no,
the
speech
of
course
is
not
unlawful.
that's
not
our
assertion.
of
course,
controlling
the
conduct,
enjoining
the
conduct
will
have
some
impact
on
speech,
but
it
is
in
response
to
the
fact
that
people
in
the
position,
in
this
case
close
to
the
clinic,
intimidated,
harassed,
interfered
with
people
who
were
seeking
the
services
of
the
clinic,
or
were
providing
those
services,
and
that
was
sufficient
in
the
view
of
the
court
to
justify
the
injunction.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
this
record
shows,
for
example,
that
there
were
ladders
placed
up
against
the
fences
of
the
clinic,
signs
were
put
down
inside
these
privacy
fences
so
that
the
patients
could
see
it
in
the
areas
where
surgery
was
being
conducted,
or
they
were
recovering.
some
of
those
signs
had
the
names
of
the
partners
of
women
who
were
going
through
those
surgical
procedures.
those
were
not
simply
informational
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
protesters.
those
were
designed
to
interfere
with
the
processes
of
the
clinic.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
does
not
make
it
unlawful.
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--justice
ginsburg
raised
the
skokie
issue...
excuse
me.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think,
given
those
facts,
that
might
approach
to
the
point
of
being
an
assault,
creating
a
fear
for
that
person
of
some
type
of
physical
attack.
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
courts
could
intervene.
indeed,
under
florida
law,
there
is
a
stalking
statute
which
is
simply
not
following
people
around,
it's
putting
them
in
fear
of
some
other
harm
to
their
person.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
think
that
there,
in
this
case
was
illegal--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--may
i
finish?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
there
could
be
a
predicate
for
criminal
action.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
thank
you.
