justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
every
county
were
like
kansas
city
and
jefferson
county,
and
that
there
were
no
disparities
because
the
counties
in
every
instance
adjusted
their
laws
so
that
the
sales
and
use
tax
were
equal.
would
there
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
you
bring
a
suit
in
those
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
one
county,
or
one
municipality,
then
deviates,
then
the
entire
statutory
scheme
falls?
