mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
commerce
clause
challenge
to
section
144.748
of
the
revised
statutes
of
missouri,
which
imposes
an
additional
use
tax
of
1-1/2
percent
on
all
goods
purchased
from
out
of
state
for
use,
storage,
or
consumption
in
missouri.
now,
the
missouri
overall
taxing
scheme
is
thus
as
follows.
there
is
a
4.225
state-wide
sales
tax.
there
is
a
4.225
equivalent
state-wide
use
tax.
the
challenged
statute
adds
an
additional
1.5
percent
use
tax
to
be
charged
across
the
state
on
all
transactions
from
out
of
state.
there
is
no
corresponding
additional
sales
tax
state-wide.
cities
and
counties
and
other
municipalities
within
the
state,
however,
are
authorized
to
enact
local
sales
taxes
with
the
approval
of
the
voters.
there
is
no
authority
for
any
such
local
use
taxes.
now,
the
result
of
this
unusual
statutory
scheme
is
a
patchwork
taxing
scheme
within
the
state
of
missouri
that
has
22
different
local
sales
tax
rates,
ranging
from
zero
percent
in
several
counties
to
3.5
percent
in
one
city,
and
bear
in
mind
that
throughout
the
whole
state,
the
1-1/2
percent
additional
use
tax
is
applicable,
so
the
total
use
tax
applicable
throughout
the
state
of
missouri
is
5.725
percent.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
not
directly,
your
honor.
some
of
the
higher
sales
tax
rates
are
in
the
larger
cities,
and
some
of
those
that
have
no
additional
sales
tax
are
the
smaller
rural
communities,
but
there's
no...
you
can't
really
draw
a
specific
correlation.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
there
was
a
provision,
justice
o'connor,
in
1990,
right
before
this
particular
law
became
effective.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
it
had.
it
was--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
it
was
on
the
books
for
about
a
year,
but
it
was
never
implemented.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i...
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
kind
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--the
record
doesn't
really
show
that,
your
honor,
except
that
a)
the
state
thought
it
was
easier,
apparently,
to
do
it
the
way
that
it
eventually
decided
to
do
it,
and
b)
i
think
there
was
probably
some
concern
about
whether
local
voters
would
actually
adopt
a
local
use
tax.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
that
there
are
28
states
that
allow
local
use
taxes,
and
every
one
of
them
has
some
sort
of
mechanism
which
prohibits
the
local
use
tax
from
being
greater
than
the
local
sales
tax.
missouri
is
the
only
state
that
has
adopted
this
kind
of
a
scheme,
except
back
in
the
seventies,
oklahoma
tried
it,
and
the
oklahoma
statute
was
invalidated
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
under
the
commerce
clause,
a
scheme
very
similar
to
this
one,
but
we
did
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--very
much
so,
yes,
your
honor.
they
would
like
to
experiment
with
use
taxes
and
to
avoid
the
strict
rule
of
equality
that
has
pertained
to
use
taxes
since
this
court
started
deciding
these
kinds
of
cases.
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
local
delegation
of
sales
taxes--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--your
honor?
no,
we're
not.
no.
the
statute
that
we're
attacking
imposes
the
additional
1-1/2
percent
across-the-board,
state-wide
use
tax.
it's
contained
in
a
separate--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--that's
the
statute
that
causes
the
difficulty,
and
it's
a
self-contained
statute.
we're
not
even
attacking
the
basic
4.225,
basic
use
tax,
which
is
equivalent
to
the
state-wide
basic
sales
tax.
it's
the
add-on
that
causes
the
problem.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
but
the
excess
1.5
is
in
a
separate
statute,
and
it
could
be
invalidated
without
affecting
the
base.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
it
could
have,
if
the
local
municipalities
had
adopted
it.
one
of
our
objections
to
this
is
that
the
state
tried
to
preempt
the
local
option
by
imposing
this
use
tax
at
the
state
level,
and
i
think
it's
just
a
matter
of
supposition
whether
the
local
municipalities
would
have
gone
along
with
a
local
use
tax
in
all
situations.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
the
statute,
though,
that
creates
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
144.748.
that
is
a
statute
applicable
state-wide.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
does
not
produce
equality
state-wide.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
you
can't...
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
you
can't
take
averages,
as
the
state
wants
to
do.
you
have
to
look
at
this
tax
as
it
operates
in
the
marketplace--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--in
all
the
marketplaces.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
fact
is
that
this
is
a
state-wide
statute.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
insofar
as--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--insofar
as
the...
the
sales
tax
in
jackson
county
is
higher
at
present
time
than
the
use
tax,
there
is
arguably
no
damage
from
the
discrimination
in
jackson
county.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it...
i
believe
the
sales
and
use
tax
are
equal
in
the
city
of
st.
louis,
but
in...
out
of...
in
841
out
of
1,573
jurisdictions
in
the
state
of
missouri,
the
use
tax
is
higher
than
the
sales
tax--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--and
that's
because...
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor,
it
is,
because
the
state
statute
has
created
the
discrimination.
it
can't
be
severed.
it's--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
i
guess
that
would
be
some
sort
of
a
geographical
severance
type
article.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
the
statute
is
a...
it
imposes
a
1-1/2
percent
use
tax
in...
everywhere,
to
every
transaction.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
that
assumes,
i
think,
that
the
legislature
had
some
intent
that
it
would
apply
where
it's
legal
and
not
apply
where
it's
not
legal,
and
the
next--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
you
can't
analyze
the
statute
that
way,
because
every
year,
it
changes.
every--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
i
think
that...
i
think
it's
primarily,
first
of
all
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
law,
because
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
i
think
the
court
has
to
make
a
determination,
looking
at
this
statutory
scheme
as
a
whole,
whether
there
is
any
basis,
whether
in
state
or
federal
law,
for
severing
offending
parts
of
this
statute
and
salvaging
the
rest.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
because
i
think
that
the
issue
of
facial
discrimination
here
makes
the
entire
scheme
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
when
you
have
a
1-1/2
percent
across-the-board
additional
use
tax
that
is
applied
by
the
state
in
every
situation,
that
offends
the
commerce
clause,
because--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
at
the
state
level
you
have
4.225
sales
tax,
you
have
5.725
use
tax,
and
that
is...
that
is
the
scheme
that
is
being
delivered
to
the
counties,
the
municipalities,
the
cities,
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--our
position
is
that
within--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--yes,
because...
because
our
position
is
that
within
a
single
taxing
jurisdiction,
within
any
state,
if
a
use
tax
exceeds
a
sales
tax,
that
violates
the
commerce
clause.
that
inhibits
interstate
commerce.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
the
disparity
is
created
by
the
facial
difference
at
the
state
level
between
sales
tax
and
use
tax.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
would
be
statistically
improbable,
but
the
facial
problem
that
exists
with
regard
to
the
overall
statute
would
still
exist.
there
might
not
be
any
discrimination
in
fact.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
might
not
have
any
injury,
but
i...
no,
i
probably
couldn't.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no.
the
problem
is
that
there's
no
compensation.
there's
no
compensatory
tax
rate
in
the
sales
tax
area
that
you
can
point
to
for
which
this
use
tax
supposedly
compensates.
now,
the
theory...
the
only
theory
that
the
state
has
here
is
that
this
is
a
complementary,
compensatory
use
tax,
but
where
is
the
tax
for
which
it
compensates?
it's
not
at
the
state
level,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
upheld
a
system
whereby
one
sovereign
can
enact
a
tax,
pass
a
tax
that
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
and
rely
on
some
other
sovereign--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--the
state
may
allocate
taxing
responsibility,
but
it's
our
position
that
if
the
state
is
going
to
create
a
compensatory
use
tax
system,
then
either
it
has
to
do
so
at
the
state
level,
or
it
has
to
do
so...
it
has
to
delegate
to
the
municipalities
the
right
to
do
so,
and
require
that
any
use
tax
be
no
greater
than
any
sales
tax.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
requirement
of
halliburton,
of
silas
marner,
that...
silas
mason.
[laughter]
silas
mason--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--that
the
use
tax,
because
of
its
inherently
discriminatory
and
protectionist
nature
is
allowed,
but
only
under
very
restricted
circumstances,
and
the
law
is
that
you
must...
in
building
in
a
use
tax
you
must
provide
that
local
and
out-of-state
sellers
are
treated
equally,
local
and
out-of-state
goods
are
treated
equally,
and,
as
the
court
said
in
boston
stock
exchange,
a
use
tax
is
only
valid
if
a
purchaser,
looking
at
the
options
between
buying
in-state
and
buying
out-of-state
can
make
that
decision
without
regard
to
the
tax
consequences.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
question...
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case,
your
honor,
is,
is
this
a
compensatory
tax,
because
a
use
tax,
if
it's
not
a
compensatory
tax,
is
prima
facie
violative
of
the
commerce
clause.
its
only
purpose
is
to
protect
local
industry
and,
by
definition...
by
definition
it
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce,
so
where
is
the
compensating
sales
tax
that
this
act
is
designed
to
protect
local
merchants
against,
and
at--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
it's
a
lot
of
places...
there's
a
lot
of
places
where
it
isn't,
and
it
isn't
a
tax
that
compensates
for
the
use
tax.
it
is
a
range
of
22
different...
a
hodge
podge
of
22
different
local
sales
taxes.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--no
sales
tax...
no
use
tax,
sales
tax
arrangement
has
every
been
upheld,
to
my
knowledge,
where
there
was
a
difference
within
a
taxing
jurisdiction...
any
taxing
jurisdiction--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--if
they
were
required
to,
as--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--and
you
had
an
across-the-board
use
tax--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
it
means
that
within
841
jurisdictions
in
the
state
of
missouri,
the
use
tax
is
higher
than
the
sales
tax.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
if
you
mandated
a
minimum
of
sales
tax--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--then
i
think
you
could
point
to
that
use
tax
as
compensating
for
that
minimum.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
the
gross
disparity
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
is
unprecedented.
it's--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
under
those
circumstances
that
that
was
a
compensating
use
tax,
but
i
don't
find
in
this
case
anything
that
can
be
pointed
to
as
a
compensating
sales
tax,
the
tax
for
which--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
that's
not
what
this
use
tax
was
designed
to
compensate
for.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
state
just
decided
they
wanted
to
do
it
a
different
way,
and
there
isn't
any
reason
they
couldn't
have
done
it
the
right
way.
as
a
result,
there
are
26
percent
of
missouri
citizens
who
live
in
areas
where
the
use
tax
is
greater
than
the
sales
tax,
and
that's
because
of
this
statute.
that's
1,300,000
people,
who
when
they
decide
to
buy
an
appliance
from
the
j.
c.
penney
catalogue
store
are
going
to
pay
a
higher
use
tax
than
if
they
went
down
to
the
corner
and
bought
the
same--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--for
a
sales
tax,
yes
and
that's
what
this
court
has
held,
justice
kennedy.
that...
silas
mason
said,
equality
is
the
theme
that
permeates
this--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--there
is
a...
in
some
counties
there
is
a
higher
sales
tax
than
a
use
tax,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
what
the
state
argues,
but
i...
you
can't
discriminate
in
some
areas
of
the
state
and
say,
well,
we're
sorry
about
that,
but
we're
making
it
up
over
here
in
kansas
city.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
yes,
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well...
and
i
don't
know
that
they're
being
favored,
but
there
are
more
sales
taxes
being
collected
than
if
the
uniform
sales
tax
rate
were
1.5
percent,
but
the
state
says,
well,
we
have
the
right
to
charge
more
over
here
and
less
over
here,
but
that
leads
to
exactly
the
kind
of
trade,
or
potentially
to
the
kind
of
trade
wars
that
the
commerce
clause
is
designed
to
prevent.
what,
for
instance,
would
prevent
the
state
of
missouri
from
enacting
large
use
taxes
around
the
perimeter
of
the
state
to
frustrate
citizens
from
going
across
the
border
and
buying
goods
and
having
no
use
taxes
in
the
center
of
the
state?
that's
what
they
want
the
right
to
do.
they
even
would
support
by
their
argument
a
state
statute
which
authorized
the
enactment
of
local
sales
and
use
taxes
by
the
local
municipalities
with
no
correlation
to
each
other.
they
would
say
that
any
municipality
could
have
a
sales
tax
here--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
ginsburg,
administrative
convenience
is
not
an
excuse
for
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
the
courts
have
been
uniform
in
holding
that,
but
you
can't
look
at
averages
around
the
state
and
say,
it
comes
out
with
more
sales
tax
than
use
tax.
commerce
is
conducted
in
the
local
marketplace,
in
the
counties,
in
the
cities,
and
the
highways
and
byways,
where
individuals
are
making
decisions
about
what
goods
to
buy
and
from
where,
and
where
merchants
are
being
required
to
compete
against
people
from
out
of
state,
and
the
state
of
missouri
has
created
a
situation
whereby
in
more
than
half
of
the
areas
of
the
state,
the
interstate
vendors
are
being
disadvantaged.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that...
no.
that
number
was
found
by
the
trial
court,
but
that
relates
to
the
sales
being
made
in-state,
not
to
the
use
tax
analysis,
which
frankly
isn't
developed
in
the
record,
but
what
is
developed
is
that
26
percent
of
the
population
live
in
areas
where
they
pay
higher
use
tax
than
sales
tax,
and
that's
not
anybody's
fault
except
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--we
don't
know
that,
but
we
know
that
1,300,000
people
live
in
areas
where,
if
they
buy
from
out
of
state,
they're
going
to
pay
more.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
absolutely.
section
144.747,
the
repealed
statute
that
justice
o'connor
questioned
me
about,
did
it
the
way
that
every
other
state
in
the
union
does
it.
that
is,
it
says...
the
state
says
to
the
local
municipality,
you
may
enact
a
sales
tax.
you
may
also,
at
the
same
time,
enact
a
use
tax.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
unless
you
impose
them
both
at
the
state
level.
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
is
a
discriminatory
tax
case.
this
is
not
a
burden
case
like
exxon,
this
is
not
a
health
or
safety
measure,
it's
not
economic
regulation,
it's
not
environmental.
it's
a
discriminatory
tax
case,
and
it's
guided
by
the
court's
opinion
in
complete
auto
transit,
and
the
third
element
of
complete
auto
transit
is,
no
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
this
court
has
decided
three
use
tax
cases
since
use
taxes
came
into
being
back
in
the
thirties.
the
first
was
the
silas
mason
case...
strict
equality.
the
second
was
the
halliburton
case
in
1963,
where
chief
justice
warren
struck
down
for
the
court
a
use
tax
which
did
not
provide
strict
equality.
there
was
a
differential
in
the
basis
between
the
way
the
use
tax
and
the
sales
taxes
were
calculated.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
your
honor,
as,
i
think
justice
stevens
said,
we
are
attacking
the
statute
on
its
face.
it
is
stipulated
all
of
the
members
of
our
organization
and
the
individual
petitioner
here
have
paid
the
use
tax
since
it
went
into
effect,
so
the
facial
validity
is
challenged
by
us
for
having
paid
the
use
tax,
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--not
expressly,
no,
but
we
have
paid
the
tax.
we
are
attacking
144.748
on
its
face.
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
carve
it
up
and
uphold
part
of
it
where
it's
legal
and
part
of
it
where
it's
not
legal,
because
we
don't
think
the
statute
is
susceptible--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
but
the
statute
isn't
susceptible
to
that,
your
honor.
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
seriously
rewrite
this
statute,
which
is
a
state
enactment,
in
order
to
come
up
with
that
sort
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
the
principle
is
that
a
taxing
system
that
treats
a
use
tax
and
a
sales
tax
differently
is
now
and
forever
discriminatory
and
facially
invalid,
and
it's
not
general
american
that
controls
that.
general
american
was
not
a
use
tax
case,
was
not
even
a
modern
type
of
compensatory
tax
case.
it
was
more
an
equal
protection
case
than
a
commerce
clause
case.
the
law
in
this
area,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
stare
decisis
and
the
bright
line,
the
stare
decisis
and
the
bright
line
come
from
silas
mason
and
the
halliburton
case,
and
in
halliburton
the
court
said,
"the
conclusion
is
inescapable.
"
"equal
treatment
for
in-state
and
out-of-state
taxpayers
similarly
situated
is
the
condition
precedent
for
a
valid
use
tax
on
goods
imported
from
out
of
state.
"
that's
a
bright
line.
that's
the
line
that
the
state
of
missouri
for
its
own
reasons
decided
to
cross
in
this
case
and
experiment
with
a
new
type
of
taxation
which,
if
permitted
by
this
court,
i
suggest
could
lead
to
all
sorts
of
abuses
and,
in
fact,
some
of
the
amici
are
sort
of
champing
at
the
bit
to
see
whether
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
this
case
will
open
some
new
loopholes
in
use
tax
regulation
which,
since
1937
in
the
silas
mason
case,
have
been
closed.
the
bright
line
is
desirable.
the
bright
line
is
equality.
the
state
of
missouri
either
can
enact
either
local
sales
and
use
taxes
at
the
state
level,
or
it
can
delegate
to
the
states...
to
the
subdivisions
the
right
to
enact
local
sales
and
use
taxes,
as
28
states,
other
than
missouri,
have
done.
you're
right,
justice
souter,
they
are
a
pioneer...
i
guess,
justice
scalia...
they
are
trying
to
be
a
pioneer
here.
we
think
that's
illegal.
