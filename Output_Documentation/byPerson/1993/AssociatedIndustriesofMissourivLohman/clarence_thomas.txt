thomas
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
no.93-397,
associated
industries
of
missouri
versus
lohman
which
is
before
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
the
state
of
missouri
imposes
a
uniform
statewide
use
tax
of
1.5%
on
goods
purchased
outside
the
state
and
used
or
consumed
within
the
state.
the
tax
is
extensively
designed
to
compensate
the
sales
taxes
imposed
by
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
on
sales
of
goods
within
the
state.
the
local
sales
tax
rates,
however,
vary
widely
and
in
many
jurisdictions,
the
1.5%
use
tax
exceeds
the
local
sales
tax.
petitioners,
representing
businesses
that
must
collect
or
pay
the
use
tax,
claimed
that
this
tax
scheme
discriminates
against
interstate
trade
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
analyzing
the
tax
scheme
under
our
compensatory
tax
doctrine,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
determined
that
given
the
high
average
rate
of
local
sales
taxes
in
missouri,
the
overall
effect
of
the
tax
scheme
was
to
place
a
lighter
aggregate
burden
on
interstate
trade
than
on
intrastate
trade.
in
the
court's
view,
that
meant
that
there
was
no
discrimination
against
interstate
trade
on
a
statewide
basis
and
that
the
tax
did
not
violate
the
commerce
clause.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
the
use
tax
on
its
face
is
discriminatory
because
it
applies
only
to
goods
purchased
outside
the
state.
and
while
it
is
true
that
the
compensatory
tax
doctrine
may
save
a
facially
discriminatory
tax
from
constitutional
infirmity,
missouri's
use
tax
schemes
runs
afoul
of
the
requirement
under
our
cases
that
to
be
compensatory
the
burdens
imposed
on
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce
must
be
equal
or
at
least
that
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce
must
not
exceed
the
burden
on
intrastate
commerce.
under
missouri's
scheme,
whether
the
use
tax
is
equal
to
or
lower
than
the
sales
tax
is
entirely
a
matter
of
fortuity
depending
on
the
locality
where
the
missouri
purchaser
happens
to
reside.
in
those
localities
where
the
use
tax
exceeds
the
sales
tax,
the
tax
scheme
impermissibly
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
the
missouri
supreme
court's
statewide
aggregating
approach
to
assessing
discrimination
is
inconsistent
with
our
prior
cases.
we
have
implicitly
rejected
any
theory
that
would
require
aggregating
the
burdens
on
commerce
across
an
entire
state
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
imposed
by
particular
political
subdivision.
we
reject
the
argument
that
the
use
tax
is
invalid
in
its
entirety.
it
is
only
the
actual
discrimination
that
results
in
localities
where
the
use
tax
exceeds
the
sales
facts
that
violates
the
cnstitution.
justice
blackmun
concurs
in
the
judgment.
