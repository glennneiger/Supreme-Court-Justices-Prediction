justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
not,
mr.
walsh?
why
wouldn't
it
be
an
adequate
remedy
to
simply
say
the
constitution
prohibits
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
in
those
jurisdictions
where
it
produces
a
higher
total
than
produces
any
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
collection
of
it
in
jackson
county,
for
example.
it's
only
those
jurisdictions
in
which
you
have
this
disparity
running
in
one
direction.
i
don't
know
why
your
remedy
wouldn't
be
adequate
to
just
say
it
cannot
be
enforced
in
those
jurisdictions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
assume
the
federal
constitution
just
requires
correction
of
federal
constitutional
violations.
it
doesn't
require
a
windfall.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't
you
agree
that
you
would
have
no
constitutional
claim
if
the
cities
were
all
allowed
to
impose
sales
taxes
of
at
least
1-1/2
percent,
and
there
was
a
hodge
podge
of
those
from
1-1/2
percent
to
5
percent?
then
you
wouldn't
have
any
claim,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
required
to
have
a
minimum
of
1-1/2
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
a
hodge
podge
above
1-1/2
percent,
and
the
hodge
podge
does
not
mean
anything,
does
it?
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
no,
no,
i'm
assuming
that
it
can't
be,
that
you
have
a
1-1/2
percent--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
the
sales
tax,
yes,
of
1-1/2
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
the
minimum,
and
the
hodge
podge
and
the
excess
would
be
constitutionally
irrelevant.
if
there's
a
hodge
podge
all
by
itself,
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
it's
just
that
there
is
some
jurisdictions
in
which
that
there
is
a
lack
of
total
compensation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it's
unprecedented,
but
you
seem
to
agree...
at
least,
i
think
you
do...
that
if
you
had
the
same
gross
disparity
but
the
minimum
of
1-1/2
percent,
there
would
be
no
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
compensates
for
1-1/2
percent
in
jackson
county
and
st.
louis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
your
proposition
is
that
a
use
tax
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
unless
in
all
instances
it
compensates
for
a
state
sales
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
just
comment
on
one
point
that
it's
hard
for
me
to
get
out
of
my
mind?
if
the
law
has
been
as
clear
as
it
has
been
since
1926
with
the
general
american
tax
case,
and
if
the
advantages
of
your
system
are
so
obvious,
why
do
you
suppose
you're
a
pioneer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
make
this
point
in
your
brief
in
opposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no
i
accept
that.
just
tell
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
had
one
other
question
on
the
basic
standing.
if
their
challenge
is
to
the
entire
statute,
then
they
wouldn't
have
to
allege,
which
i
think
your
opponent
argues,
rather
than
just
to
the
jurisdictions
where
there's
a
disparity.
they
do
have
standing
to
make
that
challenge,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
they're
claiming
a
total
refund
of
the
whole...
so
that
much
is
at
least
before
us.
