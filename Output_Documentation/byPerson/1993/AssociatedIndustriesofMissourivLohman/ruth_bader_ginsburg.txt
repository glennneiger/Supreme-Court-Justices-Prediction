it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
the
scheme
that
you
said
you
would
not
challenge
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
if
all
of
the
local
jurisdictions
in
fact
added
on
a
use
tax,
would
have
netted
more
money
rather
than
less.
you
had
a
line
in
your
brief
about
missouri
attempting
to
swell
its
coffers
at
the
expense
of
interstate
commerce,
and
yet
the
scheme
that
you
say
would
be
constitutional
could
have
netted
the
state
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
question
of
state
law?
i
mean,
if
the...
your
argument
on
federal
constitutionality
is
you
can't
have
a
higher
use
tax
than
sales
tax.
if
this
court
just
says
that,
then
why
isn't
the
state
free
to
say,
our
statute
stands
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
violate
that
constitutional
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
constitutional
law
where
the
use
tax
higher
than
a
sales
tax
is
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
once
that
proposition...
if
that
proposition
is
decided
in
your
favor,
then
why
shouldn't
the
rest...
what
happens
next,
excepting
that
premise,
be
for
the
state
to
determine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
mention
the
word
severability.
i
don't
understand
why
the
severability
question
isn't
for
the
state
to
decide.
if
it
were
a
federal
law,
yes,
it
would
be
for
this
court
to
decide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
in
some
cases,
in
some
counties,
where
there's
a
larger
population,
larger
percent
sales,
interstate
sales
can
be
said
to
be
preferred
because
the
total
tax
burden
on
them
will
be
less.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
though
in
those
cases
you
can
say
the
discrimination
is
in
favor
of
interstate
sales.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
the
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
say,
can
you...
if
you
look
at
it,
the
whole
picture,
interstate
sales
are
being
favored,
but
in
particular
counties
in-state
sales
are
favored.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you're
saying
a
lot
of
things
that
they
would
say,
but
i
haven't
heard
it
from
them.
i
thought
their
whole
point
was,
it's
the
collection
of
this
is
a
nightmare
if
we
do
it
by
how
much
each
locality
puts
on,
so
we're
trying
to
make
it
simple,
and
we're
simplifying
it
in
a
way
that
overall
interstate
commerce
is
not
being
disadvantaged.
if
anything,
the
interstate...
doing...
looking
at
the
whole
picture,
the
interstate
sales
are
being
taxed
less.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
work
in
states
that
have
the
county
option?
does
the
state
also
collect
and
remit
to
the
individual
county,
depending
on
what
that
county's
tax
rate
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
system,
you
were
the
innovator
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
obviously
not.
you
don't
want
any
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
we
wouldn't
have
to
do
anything
except
say
what
the
principle
is,
and
the
rest
is
for
state
law.
