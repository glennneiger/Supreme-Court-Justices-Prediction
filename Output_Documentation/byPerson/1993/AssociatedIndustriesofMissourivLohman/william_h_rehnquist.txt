chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-397,
the
associated
industries
of
missouri,
v.
janet
lohman.
mr.
walsh.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
correspondence,
mr.
walsh,
between
the
size
of
the
local
sales
tax
and
the
population
of
the
taxing
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
the
combination
of
the
use
tax
exceeding
the
sales
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
accept
your
submission,
we
would
not
strike
down
any
provision
of
missouri
law
across
the
board.
for
instance,
you
have
no
grounds
of
complaint,
as
i
understand
it,
about
the
situation
in
kansas
city,
or
perhaps
jackson
county,
or
the
city
of
st.
louis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
you
have
to
show
that
it
produces
a
higher
use
tax
than
sales
tax
in
a
particular
jurisdiction.
you
can't
show
that
with
respect
to
kansas
city
or
with
respect
to
the
city
of
st.
louis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you
have
to
look
at
it
with
respect
to
each
of
the
taxing
jurisdictions.
what
complaint
do
you
have
about
the
situation,
say,
in
jackson
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
mean...
but
answer
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
complaint
do
you
have
about
the
situation
in
jackson
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
same
is
true
in
the
city
of
st.
louis,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition,
mr.
walsh?
now,
it
would
be
something
about
the
structure
of
state
government.
it
certainly
has
nothing
to
do
with
interstate
commerce.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
those
are
all
commerce
clause
principles.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
urging
here
something
that
i
don't
think
has
ever
emerged
in
any
of
our
commerce
cases
or
any
other
case,
and
that
is
that
somehow
the
state
has
to
handle
it
all
itself,
and
you
don't
look
at
the
net
result
between
taxing
authorities
and
the
state,
but
there's
some
principle
that
requires
the
state
to
do
certain
parts
of
it
and
the
counties
to
do
a
certain
part
of
it,
and
we
have
many
cases
saying
that
the
state
can
divide
up
its
authority
the
way
it
wants
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
in
st.
louis,
certainly,
and
it's
in
jackson
county.
you've
agreed
to
both
of
those.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
true
in
lots
of
jurisdictions,
that
you
have
a
state
sales
tax,
and
then
you
have
also
a
local
sales
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
you're
not
attacking
that
principle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
walsh,
you
say
half
the
areas
of
the
state.
now,
the
respondents
in
their
brief
say
that
92
percent
of
all
taxable
transactions
in
the
state
carry
a
sales
tax
rate
equal
to
or
greater
than
the
average
use
tax
rate.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
walsh.
mr.
downing,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that's
entirely
correct.
you're
suggesting,
and
you
suggest
you're
in
agreement
with
justice
souter,
that
someone
can
come
in
and
attack
a
tax
that
he
claims
discriminates
against
interest...
even
though
he
has
suffered
no
injury
from
the
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
the
state
and
the
petitioner
stipulated
here,
didn't
they,
on
some
facts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
stipulation
that
governed
whether
any
particular
plaintiff
suffered
injury
as
a
result
of
the
operation
of
the
missouri--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
now,
wait
a
minute,
in
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
opinion
on
page
a-2
of
the
petition,
the
opinion
says
"the
parties,
however,
have
stipulated
that
appellants
pay
sales
taxes
in
geographical
areas
where
the
aggregate
sales
tax
is
less
than
the
aggregate
use
tax.
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
take
a
care
pretty
much
the
way
the
state
supreme
court
gives
it
to
us
on
factual
matters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
downing.
mr.
walsh,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
also
stipulated
that
you
paid
it
in
jurisdictions
where
the
use
tax
was
higher
than
the
sales
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walsh.
the
case
is
submitted.
