justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
is
amicus
on
the
other
side.
they
would
like
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
agree
with
you
that
the
state
statute
appears
to
be
the
problem,
and
perhaps
your
remedy
for
the
future
is
that
that
statute
is
invalid,
but
as
far
as
collection
of
taxes
past
paid,
is
it
your
assertion
that
anyone,
no
matter
where
those
taxes
were
paid,
whether
in
kansas
city
or
anywhere
else,
is
entitled
to
a
refund?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
more
relevant
figure
is
what
percentage
of
out-of-state
sales
are
made
in
jurisdictions
that
charge
less
than
the
offsetting
sales
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
don't
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
answer,
other
than
administrative
inconvenience
is
no
excuse,
to
the
argument
that,
well,
if
you
do
this
to
us
as
a
practical
matter,
we
can't
leave
it
to
local
option?
is
there
any
convenient
way
to
allow
local
option?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
collect
the
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
you
have
to
do
is
restrict
local
option
to
this
extent
sales
and
use
tax
have
to
go
hand-in-hand?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true.
do
you
mean
that
a
state
can
have
a
blatantly
unconstitutional
tax
upon
interstate
commerce
coming
into
one
county
and
the
state
say
no,
but
anybody
who
does
business
in
this
county
from
out
of
state
shall
pay
$1,000
a
day,
so
long
as
that
is
offset
by
beneficence
to
interstate
commerce
in
other
sections
of
the
state,
and
you
look
on
the
balance
and
say,
well,
on
balance,
you
know,
the
business
in
this
county
is
being
discriminated
against,
but
they're
really
good
to
interstate
commerce
elsewhere.
is
that
the
argument
you
say
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
that,
you
say
yes,
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you...
does
that
mean
your
answer
to
my
question
is,
that
is
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
county
can
impose
a
$100
fee
on
people
doing
business
in
that
county
from
out
of
state,
so
long
as
other
counties
give
people
doing
business
a
rebate,
in
equivalent
dollar
amount?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
before
you
get
off
that
one,
what
you're
saying
is,
if
the
other
counties
had
favored
out-of-state
waste,
that
would
be
okay,
so
a
state
can
pass
a
law
saying,
the
eastern
half
of
our
state,
no
out-of-state
waste
is
allowed.
the
western
half,
we
favor
out-of-state
waste,
so
all
out-of-state
waste
has
to
go
into
the
western
half,
and
none
of
it
can
go
into
the
eastern
half.
a
state
can
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
long
as
the
net
effect
is
pretty
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
we
could
conclude
anything
we
want.
i'm
asking
you,
is
it
constitutional
or
not?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
constitutional
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can
split
up
a
national
market.
we
just
have
to
do
it
in
a
checkerboard
pattern,
with
each
square
on
the
checkerboard
being
less
than
an
entire
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that?
what
is
your
support
for
that?
we
don't
care
what
you
do
to
any
individual
in
interstate
commerce
so
long
as
the
overall
effect
isn't
bad.
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
dealing
with
a
provision
that
is
not
facially
discriminatory
there.
the
examples
i've
been
giving
you
are
examples
where
on
its
face
the
statute
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
i
want
a
case
like
that,
in
which
where
there
is
such
facial
discrimination
we
say,
that's
okay,
so
long
as
somewhere
else
it's
balanced
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
in
the
age
of
computers
it's
really
a
lot
of
trouble
to
figure
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
various
counties,
you
have...
you
know
where
it's
being
sold
into,
and
you
know
what
the
tax
rate
is
there.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
a
whole
lot
of
trouble.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
what
i
would
tell
those...
i
would
tell
those
sellers,
well,
just...
if
it's
a
whole
lot
of
trouble,
just
pay
1-1/2
percent
and
you'll
be
sure
always
to
be
giving
enough,
which
is
what
you're
making
them
do.
they
could
do
that
voluntarily,
if
it
was
really
a
lot
of
trouble
to
figure
out
what
the
proper
rate
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
unfavorably,
as
i
recall,
in
the
case
of
hellerstein.
he
thought
it
was
a
commerce
clause
case
that
was
decided
wrong,
or
at
least
wouldn't
be
decided
that
way
today.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
downing,
can
i
ask
you
to
imagine
for
a
moment
the
unlikely
and
horrible
event
that
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
scheme.
i
assume
you
would
prefer
that
we
not
say
that
all
of
the
imposed
taxes
are
unconstitutional,
but
rather,
only
those
that
exceed
the
local
rates
in
the
counties
affected.
i
assume
you
would
prefer
that
outcome
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why?
why
is
that
a
proper
way
to
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
a
state
just
passes
a
general
law
saying
all
out-of-state
sales
shall
pay...
all
out-of-state
sellers
shall
pay
$500
a
year
to
the
state,
all
right.
now,
would
we
analyze
the
constitutionality
of
that
by
going
case-by-case
to
find
out
whether
in
fact
for
this
particular
seller
the
sales
taxes
that
that
seller
avoided
offset
the
$500
and
say
only
those
who
ended
up
paying
more
than
would
have
been
taken
out
of
their
hides
in
sales
tax,
only
those
have
been
treated
unconstitutionally?
we
wouldn't
do
that,
would
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
once
you're
taxing
substantially
equivalent
events,
then
it's
only
where
there
are
differences
at
most,
where
there
are
differences
that
we
would
require
the
funds
to
be
refunded.
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
haven't
even
claimed
paying...
they
haven't
even
claimed
paying
the
use
tax
in
a
jurisdiction
that
has
a
lower
sales
tax?
if
they've
claimed
that,
they've
claimed
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
really
want
to
win
this
case
on
that
ground
so
we
can
do
it
again
another
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
allegation
that
any
of
them
paid
the
use
tax
in
the
juris--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
a
jurisdiction
that
had
a
lower
sales
tax.
