mr.
walsh,
at
one
time
was
there
a
provision
that
said
if
a
local
community
imposes
an
additional
sales
tax
of
its
own,
that
it
would
impose
an
equivalent
use
tax
at
the
same
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
had
that
been
adopted
by
the
legislature?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
it
ever
go
into
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
had
that
been
implemented,
would
you
be
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
was
it
not
implemented?
why
was
this
shift
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
method
employed
in
some
other
states
that
allow
local
imposition
of
additional
sales
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
county-by-county
or
city-by-city,
and
clearly,
in
a
good
many
communities
there,
there
is
facial
discrimination.
i
mean,
there
it
is.
you
have
to
accept
the
case
on
that
theory
and
then
tell
us
how
we
deal
with
it
and
what
you
rely
on,
other
than
that
general
acceptance
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
had
a
scheme
in
1990,
one
that
justice
o'connor
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
this
argument,
that
wouldn't
raise
any
constitutional
questions
but
it
was
never
implemented.
can
you
tell
us
why
that
scheme
was
abandoned
and
this
uncommon
one
adopted
in
its
place?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
bright
line
rule
was
no
facial
discrimination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
jurisdiction
by
jurisdiction,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me
just
a
moment.
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
when
you're
on
your
final
thing.
are
you
going
to
address
standing
at
all?
