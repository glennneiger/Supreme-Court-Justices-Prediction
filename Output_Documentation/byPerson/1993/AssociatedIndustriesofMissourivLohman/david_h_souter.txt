justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
keep
speaking
of
offending
parts
of
the
statute.
the
question
of
severance
is
offending
taxing
jurisdictions,
and
how
those
particular
taxing
jurisdictions
reach
the
point
of
offending
seems
to
me
is
a
question
of
state
law.
it's
the
result
which
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
why
do
we
not,
in
order
to
rule
your
way,
simply
declare
the
disparity
is
unconstitutional,
leaving
it
to
state
law
to
unscramble
the
eggs
any
way
it
wants
to
in
order
to
get
the
required
result?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
facial
discrimination
is...
i
was
going
to
say
the
bottom
line.
i
guess
it's
the
top
line.
that's
where
the
discrimination
is.
i
don't
see
where
it
becomes
a
federal
question
to
identify
whether
one
element
of
a
complex
state
tax
scheme
is
the
particular
culprit
as
distinct
from
the
unconstitutional
result
that
all
of
those
elements
produce.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
it
only
offends
the
commerce
clause
because
it's
being
added
on
to
two
other
layers
of
tax,
one
of
which
is
within
the
control
of
particular
counties
and
municipalities.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
telling
us
that
in
order
for
you
to
win
your
case
we
have
in
fact
got
to,
as
it
were,
tell
the
state
how
to
unscramble
the
causes
that
bring
about
this
top
line
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes
or
no.
yes
or
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
assuming
that
we're
deciding
a
question
of
state
sovereignty.
isn't
it
the
state's
business
to
decide
how
it's
going
to,
as
it
were,
allocate
its
governmental
taxing
power?
don't
we
simply
look
to
the
state
as
a
whole
and
ask
what
the
result
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
easier
to
administer.
don't
you
mean
easier,
in
a
way,
to
legislate,
because
i
take
it
the
tax
is
actually
paid
to
the
county
or
the
municipality.
it's
not
paid
to
the
state,
and
then
the
municipalities
and
counties
remit
the
state
portion
to
it,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
have
we
ever
distinguished
between...
have
we
ever,
rather,
ignored
jurisdictions
in
the
way
that
you
are
asking
us
to
ignore
jurisdictions,
because
what
the
state
is
doing,
as
you
described
to
me
a
moment
ago,
is
becoming
a
collection
agent
for
the
various
sub-state
jurisdictions,
but
the
tax...
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
differential,
the
tax
is
a
tax
of
that
sub-state
jurisdiction,
and
you
are
in
effect
saying,
ignore
the
actual
taxing
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
have
we
ever
done
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
rate
for
any
given
transaction
was
going
to
be
the
same,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
wasn't
a
commerce
clause
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
that
an
equal
protection
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
may
i
just
interrupt
you?
your
whole
argument,
i
take
it
here,
is
rejecting
the
notion
that
there
is
a
facial
discrimination,
so
on
this
argument,
it's
a
pure
allocation
of
burden
argument,
is
that
right?
if
we
say
there
is
a
facial
discrimination,
then
i
take
it
this
argument
would
not
have
any
application.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
taxing
jurisdiction
by
taxing
jurisdiction
approach,
but
in
any
event,
if
we...
to
the
extent
that
we
say
there's
a
facial
discrimination,
i
take
it
this
argument
would
not
be
inappropriate,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
have
a
facial
discrimination
and
there
is
a
transaction
that
is
taxed,
the
party...
the
seller
to
that
transaction
would
pass
your
test,
would
he
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
have
a
facial
discrimination,
and
one
of
the
petitioners--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
one
of
the
petitioners
here
is
an
interstate
seller
whose
transaction
was
taxed
at
the
facially
discriminatory
rate,
that's
enough,
isn't
it?
