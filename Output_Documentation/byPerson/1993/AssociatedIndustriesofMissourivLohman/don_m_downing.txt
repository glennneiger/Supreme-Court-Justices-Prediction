mr.
don
m.
downing
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
petitioners
would
have
this
court
do
is
invalidate
a
state
compensatory
tax
system
that
substantially
favors
interstate
commerce
overall.
well,
this
court's
never
been
willing
to
do
that,
for
good
reason.
to
do
so--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--your
honor,
certainly
there's
ample
precedent
in
this
court's
cases...
the
bacchus
case,
for
example.
mr.
don
m.
downing
no...
your
honor,
i'm
saying
in
terms
of,
if
the
purpose
for
that
county's
action
was
to
protect
the
local
market
segment,
or
an
industry,
if
we're
getting
into
the
bacchus
situation
where
there's
an
identifiable
market
segment,
that's
one
issue,
but
this
court's
commerce
clause
cases
have
looked
historically
at
the
overall
effect
of
state
regulation
on
the
national
economy.
as
the
court
said
in
the
exxon
case,
the
commerce
clause
is
designed
to
protect
the
interstate
market,
not
particular
interstate
firms.
mr.
don
m.
downing
if
one
county
enacted
a...
decided
to
have
no
sales
tax
in
order
to
benefit
local
businesses,
that
would
be
okay,
as
long
as
the
overall
effect
of
state
regulation
on
the
national
economy
was
either
neutral
or
pro
interstate
commerce,
like
it
is
here.
mr.
don
m.
downing
i
think
that's
a
different
situation,
your
honor,
because
that's
not
a
compensatory
tax
case.
in
the
compensatory
tax
area,
this
case
is
analyzed
differently
from...
for
example,
i
think
the
hypothetical
you're
talking
about
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
fort
gratiot
case
the
court
decided
2
years
ago,
where
a
local
county
had
an
environmental
regulation
in
which
it
decided
it
was
not
going
to
accept
out-of-state
waste.
well,
all
the
other
counties
in
the
state
treated
out-of-state
waste
evenhandedly.
they
treated
them
just
like
it
was
in-state
waste,
so
the
net
effect
of
fort
gratiot,
just
like
i
think
in
the
hypothetical
you're
pointing
out,
the
net
effect
was
an
overall
burden
to
interstate
commerce.
every
county
was
treated
equally.
one
county
was
discriminating...
net,
overall
burden.
well,
here,
the
parallel
to
this
case--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--i
think
that--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--i
think
the
court
could
conclude,
certainly,
that
that
was
not
isolationist,
that
the
state
was
trying
to...
not
to--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--well,
it's
not
a
compensatory
tax
case.
environmental
cases,
the
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--yes,
i
think
it
could
be.
i
think
it
could
be,
under
the
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
case,
and
under
the
chemical
waste
case
and
fort
gratiot.
environmental
regulations
have
been
treated
differently
by
this
court
than
compensatory
tax
cases.
mr.
don
m.
downing
your
honor,
as
long
as
this
court...
the
court
2
years
ago
pointed
out
in
quill
that
unlike
the
due
process
clause
which
is
concerned
with
the
effect
on
individuals
and
particular
firms,
the
commerce
clause
is
not
concerned
about
particular
interstate
firms,
it's
concerned
about
the
overall
effect
of
state
regulation
on
the
national
economy.
here,
interstate--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--well,
the
exxon--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--the
exxon
case
specifically
held
that.
it
was
a
situation
in
which
you
had
three
interstate
firms
that
were
petroleum
refiners,
and
the
state
there
prohibited
petroleum
refiners
from
having
a
gasoline
station
in
their
state,
allegedly
to
protect
local
gasoline
dealers.
they
didn't
want
the
exxons
and
the
amocos
coming
into
their
state,
and
the
court
held
in
exxon
that
the
mere
fact
that
three
interstate
firms
suffered
a
net
competitive
disadvantage
as
a
result
of
the
state
statute
doesn't
matter
under
the
commerce
clause,
because
it
said,
and
i
quote,
"the
commerce
clause
protects
the
interstate
market,
not
particular
interstate
firms.
"
mr.
don
m.
downing
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
turns
on
how
you
define
what
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
is.
here,
missouri's
system
substantially
favors
interstate
commerce
overall.
if
you
define
discrimination
on
a
transaction-by-transaction
or
firm-by-firm
approach,
i
would
agree
with
you.
if
you
define
it
on
an
overall
level--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--well,
in
terms
of
a
compensatory
tax,
the
state
was
attempting
to
compensate.
mr.
walsh
raised
that
there
was
nothing
for
the
state
to
compensate
for.
well,
in
maryland
v.
louisiana,
and
tyler
pike,
the
analysis
for
a
compensatory
tax,
you
look
at...
you
try...
the
first
step
is
to
identify
the
burden.
not
the
tax,
but
the
burden
for
which
the
state
is
attempting
to
compensate.
well,
here
it's
plain.
the
state
was
attempting
to
compensate
for
the
effect
of
the
varying
local
taxes
upon
intrastate
commerce.
it
did
that
by
setting
a
use
tax
rate,
state-wide,
which
is
20
percent
less
than
the
average
local
tax
rate.
in
missouri,
missouri
businesses
are
at
a
20-percent
net
competitive
disadvantage
to
interstate
firms
selling
to
missouri
residents.
mr.
don
m.
downing
your
honor,
i
think
missouri
found
a
better
way
to
accommodate
the
practical
needs
of
interstate
sellers.
interstate
sellers...
as
this
court
is
well
aware
from
the
quill
case,
interstate
sellers
don't
like
the
varying
local
rate
solution,
because
it
is
extremely
burdensome
for
them.
to
determine
for
every
transaction
they
sell
into
the
state
of
missouri,
there
are
over
1,000
taxable
jurisdictions.
they
would
have
to
determine
for
each
transaction
the
applicable
current
use
tax
rate
for
that
transaction.
so
that's
one
reason,
and
it
wasn't...
missouri
didn't
do
this
out
of
an
altruistic
sense
to
benefit
interstate
sellers.
i
don't
want
to
make
that
claim.
but
states
realized
that,
to
the
extent
a
tax
is
easy
to
comply
with
by
a
taxpayer,
it's
more
efficient
to
collect.
we
get
a
greater...
we
can
collect
a
greater
percentage
of
our
taxes
by
setting
a
state-wide
rate,
because
all
interstate
sellers
now
selling
into
missouri
know
exactly
what
their
tax
is
on
a
use
tax
basis,
so
that's
one
of
the
reasons.
another
reason
is,
the
identical
use
and
tax
rates
in
each
jurisdiction
approach,
well,
it
doesn't
solve
the
constitutional
problem
that
mr.
walsh
has
tried
to
point
out.
it
doesn't
guarantee
equal
treatment
in
each
and
every
instance.
for
example,
suppose
missouri
adopted
that
system,
and
you
had
a
resident
of
a
local
jurisdiction
who
wanted
to
purchase
a
washing
machine.
he
happened
to
live
in
a
jurisdiction
where
the
local
use
tax
rates
and
sales
tax
rates
were
high.
well,
he
would
have
essentially
three
options.
he
could
purchase
from
a
local
vendor
and
pay
a
high
local
sales
tax
rate,
or
he
could
purchase
from
an
out-of-state
vendor
and
pay
the
equally
high
local
use
tax
rate,
or
he
could
travel
to
another
local
jurisdiction
in
missouri
and
pay
a
low
sales
tax
rate.
well,
from
the
out-of-state
seller's
perspective,
that
out-of-state
seller
is
at
the
precise
competitive
disadvantage
in
that
situation
as
he
is
under
our
present
system,
so
missouri
recognized
that
going
to
this
identical
rate
in
each
jurisdiction
solution
doesn't
cure
any
supposed
inequality
that
might
exist.
so
to
accommodate
the
needs
of
interstate
sellers,
and
to
make
it
more
practical,
admittedly,
also
from
the
state's
perspective,
it's
easier
for
the
state
to
administer
on
a
state-wide
basis,
so
those
are
the
reasons
missouri
went
to
that
system.
mr.
don
m.
downing
no,
your
honor,
it's
paid
to
the
state,
and
then
the
state
remits
to
the
local
governments.
it
keeps
a
1
percent
administration
fee,
in
essence,
and
then
remits
the
remainder
to
local
governments.
mr.
don
m.
downing
your
honor,
that's...
that's--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
pointed
out
in
quill
that
very
point,
that
even
in
the
age
of
computers,
the
ease
with
which
interstate
sellers
can
calculate...
you
see,
within
various
counties,
you
have
different
taxable
jurisdictions.
you
can't
just
go
by
the
county.
you
can't
just
go
by
the
city.
you
can't
even
go
by
the
zip
code.
mr.
don
m.
downing
well,
your
honor,
it's
interesting
that
you
mention
that,
because
currently
pending
before
congress,
congress
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
quill
is
actively
considering
this
session
a
bill
which
would
enable...
and
essentially
adopt
the
missouri
system,
which
would
allow
states
to
set,
on
a
state-wide
basis,
a
state-wide
use
tax
rate
based
on
their
local
sales
tax
rates.
and
my
point
is
not
that
this
court
should
necessarily
defer
to
congress,
but
that
in
these
difficult
practical
issues
of
state
taxation...
the
court
in
quill
expressly
recognized
that
congress
may
well
be
better
equipped
to
address
some
of
these
issues
than
this
court,
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
the
quill
court
chose
not
to
overrule
the
bellas
hess
case.
that
case
provided
a
bright
line
rule
that
states
could
use
in
devising
their
tax
systems.
well,
that's
the
situation
here.
the
bright
line
rule
that
general
american
and
this
court's
cases
have
devised
in
this
area
is
that
if
the
tax
that
the
state
imposes
on
in-state
sales,
if
the
average
tax
is
greater
than
or
equal
to
the
tax
on
interstate
sales,
then
there's
no
commerce
clause
concern.
mr.
don
m.
downing
well,
your
honor,
again
that
gets
to
the
issue,
do
you
measure
discrimination
on
a
transaction-by-transaction
approach,
or
do
you
measure
it
on
an
overall
state-wide
basis?
mr.
don
m.
downing
well,
again,
i
would
submit
that
this
court
has
never
invalidated
a
state
tax,
compensatory
tax,
that
on
an
overall
basis
is
favorable
to
interstate
commerce
like
missouri's
is
here.
mr.
don
m.
downing
yes,
your
honor,
on
at
least
three
occasions
i
can
think
of.
the
general
american
case
is
one
which
is
discussed
extensively
in
the
briefs.
that
case
plainly
involved,
just
like
here,
a
state
which
had
varying
local
tax
rates,
and
a
state-wide
rate
that
was
set
to
compensate
for
those
varying
local
rates.
mr.
don
m.
downing
no--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--that's
not...
that
system
plainly
allowed
for
the
same
possible
instances
of
unequal
treatment
that
our
system...
just
like
here.
in
that
case,
louisiana
parishes
had
varying
local
rates
that
applied
in-state,
and
a
state-wide
rate
that
applied
to
nonresident
railroad
companies,
so
it
plainly...
just
like
here,
it
allowed
for
possible
instances--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--your
honor,
i
would
beg
to
differ,
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
don
m.
downing
justice
cardozo
believed
it
was
a
commerce
clause
case,
in
the
silas
mason
case,
and
professors
hellerstein
and
hartman
in
their
treatises
in
this
area,
respected
commentators,
both
analyzed
that
case
as
a
commerce
clause
case.
i
would
grant
you
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
language--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--he
indicated
something
to
that
effect,
your
honor,
i
would
grant
you
that,
but
again--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--professor
hellerstein--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--no...
i
was
going
to
another
thought.
mr.
don
m.
downing
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
large
part
the
states...
for
example,
the
equal
use
tax
and
sales
tax
rate
in
every
jurisdiction
states,
well,
that
has
some
superficial
appeal
to
it
from
a
commerce
clause
perspective,
i
would
grant
you
that,
but
missouri
was
aware
of
the
practical
needs
of
interstate
sellers.
i
mean,
it
was
fully
aware
of
the
quill
case,
as
it
was
going
up
through
the
courts
to
this
court,
and
there
the
interstate
commerce
and
the
interstate
sellers
came
into
missouri
and
said,
listen,
there's
a
problem
here.
we've
got
a
practical
problem
of
state
taxation.
we
want
to
comply
with
your
tax,
but
it's
very
difficult
for
us
to
do
that.
can
you
help
us?
missouri
sets
a
state-wide
rate
that
makes
it
very
easy
for
them
to
comply,
and
i
might
add
that
the
interstate
sellers
are
the
ones
in
favor
of
the
pending
congressional
legislation.
they're
the
ones
who
want
state-wide
rates,
even
though
there
might
be
possible
instances
in
which
there
could
be
inequality.
mr.
don
m.
downing
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
don
m.
downing
well,
your
honor,
there's
certainly
no
unconstitutionality
under
the
commerce
clause
for
a
state
in
any
local
jurisdiction
to
have
a
use
tax
rate
that's
lower
or
equal
to
its
sales
tax
rate.
mr.
don
m.
downing
i
think
mr.
walsh
concedes
that.
mr.
don
m.
downing
no,
your
honor.
under
this
court's
cases
the
compensatory
tax
has
to
reach
substantially
equivalent
events.
there,
i
don't
think
you
would
have
any
events
that
the
$500
flat
rate
fee
were
taxing,
so
under
the
court's
precedents,
no,
that
would
not
be
analyzed
as
a
compensatory
tax
case.
mr.
don
m.
downing
absolutely.
i'd
like
to
move
on
to
a
different
subject.
even
if
this
court
were
to
require
the
transaction-by-transaction
or
firm-by-firm
approach
advanced
by
the
petitioners,
the
respondents
nonetheless
should
prevail
in
this
case.
they
haven't
provided
any
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
that
any
interstate
firm
has
suffered
any
competitive
disadvantage
when
attempting
to
sell
to
missouri
residents.
now,
even
if
they
had...
even
if
they
had
pointed
to
and
produced
evidence
that
there
is
an
interstate
seller
that
competed
in
a
local
jurisdiction
where
the
use
tax
rate
was
higher
than
the
sales
tax
rate,
and
competed
in
that
local
jurisdiction
with
a
missouri
business,
well,
that
wouldn't
end
the
analysis,
because
then
one
would
have
to
focus--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--if
you
conclude,
under
the
court's
cases,
it's
a
facial
discrimination
because
the
transaction-by-transaction
approach
is
the
approach
the
court
wants
to
adopt--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--the
lack
of
injury
argument?
i
think--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--i
think
you're
right.
i
think
the
court's
cases
on
a
facial
challenge
do
not
require
petitioners
to
show
injury,
but
i
would
submit
to
you--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--no,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
what
i...
that's
a
standing
question.
mr.
don
m.
downing
what
i
was
addressing
was
the
injury
in
fact,
and
i'll
move
right
to
the
standing
question,
then.
petitioners
themselves
have
shown
that
they
have
suffered
no
injury
in
fact.
as
this
court
pointed
out
2
years
ago
in
the
lujan
case,
in
order
to
show
injury
in
fact,
a
plaintiff
must
plead
and
prove...
to
show
standing,
excuse
me...
a
petitioner
must
plead
and
prove
that
there's
an
injury
in
fact
that's
both
concrete
and
particularized,
and
that
is
fairly
traceable
to
the
alleged
unconstitutionality
that
he
claims.
mr.
don
m.
downing
the
only
record
of
stipulation
is
that
they
would...
the
petitioners
would
have
significant
administrative
costs
of
compliance
with
the
system.
mr.
don
m.
downing
not
at
all,
your
honor,
not
any
injury
that's
fairly
traceable
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
system.
the
fact
that
there
are
differing
use
rate,
or
higher
use
tax
rates
in
certain
jurisdictions
than
sales
tax
rates,
that's
the
unconstitutionality
they
claim
that's
in
our
system.
they
haven't
claimed
any
injury
as
a
result
of
that.
mr.
don
m.
downing
they
have
not
claimed
that.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they've
claimed
that.
the
only
transaction
that
is
in
the
record
is
petitioner
alumax
foils
made
a
purchase
in
st.
francis
county,
where
the
use
tax
rate
is
higher
than
the
sales
tax
rate.
well,
they
paid
sales
tax.
that
was
an
in-state
transaction.
they
paid
sales
tax
on
that
transaction.
well,
under
their
system,
if
the
sales
tax
rates
had
been
moved
up
to
be
equal
to
the
use
tax
rate,
they
would
have
paid
more
sales
tax,
so
they
haven't
been
injured
by
any
unconstitutionality
in
the
system.
let's
look
at
alumax
foils
where
they're
based.
they're
based
in
st.
louis,
where
the
use
tax
rate
and
the
sales
tax
rates
are
identical.
they
certainly
haven't
shown
any
injury
in
fact
in
those
counties.
they
don't
claim
there's
any
constitutional
problem
in
those
counties.
mr.
don
m.
downing
well,
your
honor...
no.
certainly,
i
would
prefer
that
this
court
say
that
you
must
look
at
the
overall
effect
of
state
regulation
on
the
national
economy,
just
like
you
did
in
quill
2
years
ago.
i
would
prefer
the
court
to
say
it's
the
interstate
market
that's
protected
by
the
commerce
clause,
not
particular
interstate
firms.
mr.
don
m.
downing
i'm
sorry,
i
need
to
hear
the
hypothetical
again.
mr.
don
m.
downing
in
a
particular
local
jurisdiction--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--right.
there's
no
evidence
of
that
here,
your
honor.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
that
any...
let
me
move
on
to
the
other
petitioner,
which
is
associated
industries,
which
has
both
in-state
members
and
out-of-state
members.
as
to
their
in-state
members,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
any
in-state
member
is
located
in
a
jurisdiction
where
the
use
tax
rate
is
higher
than
the
sales
tax
rate.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--no
allegation.
no
allegation
whatsoever.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
had
any
transactions
in
any
jurisdiction
in
which
the
use
tax
rate
is
higher
than
the
sales
tax
rate,
and
moving
on
to
their
out-of-state
members,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
any
out-of-state
member
of
associated
industries
competes
with
any
missouri
business
in
any
local
jurisdiction
in
which
the
use
tax
rate
is
higher
than
the
sales
tax
rate.
mr.
don
m.
downing
oh,
to
be
sure,
they
paid
the
tax,
but
that's--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--no.
no,
there's
no
allegation
to
that
effect
at
all
in
the
record,
your
honor.
they
have
alleged
simply
that
they
paid
the
use
tax.
that's
the
extent.
there's
no
allegation
they
paid
it
in
a
local
jurisdiction
where
the
use
tax
is
higher
than
the
sales
tax.
mr.
don
m.
downing
your
honor,
that
may
be
in
the
missouri
supreme
court's
opinion,
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
don
m.
downing
well,
your
honor,
i
don't...
i'm
not
precisely
sure
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
meant
by
that,
but
if
they
meant
to
say
that
there's
stipulation
in
the
record
that
associated
industries
does
business
in
a
local
jurisdiction
where
the
use
tax
rate
is
higher
than
the
sales
tax
rate,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
about
that.
that's
my
point.
so
neither--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--your
honor,
we
had
it
in
our
brief,
and
one
of
our
amicus
made
the
argument,
frankly
we
thought
in
a
very
good
fashion.
we
didn't
want
to
have
this
court
read
duplicate
points
on
that,
so
we
adopted
it
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
i
can
point
that
out
to
you
if
you'd
like
me
to
show
you
where
we--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--okay.
we
did.
we
thought
it
was
a
very
important
argument,
because
it's
jurisdictional
to
this
court.
finally,
i'd
like
to
make...
really,
i'd
just
like
to
say,
really
what
we
have
here
in
this
case
is
a
group
of
local
missouri
businesses
who
don't
like
section
144.748
simply
because
it
represents
a
tax
increase
to
them.
they're
not
concerned
about
any
supposed
undue
burdens
or
unequal
treatment
on
interstate
commerce.
if
there
were
such
burdens,
they're
not
the
victims
of
it.
rather,
they've
lost
in
the
missouri
political
process,
of
which
they
are
a
part.
they
are
missouri
businesses,
and
they
want
this
court
to
overturn
the
sound
judgment
of
the
missouri
legislature,
a
judgment
which
i
might
add
goes
further
to
accommodate
the
practical
needs
of
interstate
sellers
than
missouri
was
required
to
go,
so
i
would
just
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
it
not
allow
petitioner's
feigned
concern
for
any
supposed
burden
on
interstate
commerce
which
doesn't
exist
here
to
transform
what
is
essentially
a
local
political
question...
a
local
political
issue
into
a
federal
constitutional
question,
which
we
don't
think
is
presented
here.
finally,
i'd
like
to
offer
just
a
couple
of--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--standing
to
make
the
challenge
that
it's...
as
applied
in
every
case
it's
unconstitutional?
mr.
don
m.
downing
if
they
could
succeed
in
their
argument
as
applied
in
every
xx--
mr.
don
m.
downing
--absolutely,
i
agree
with
you.
finally,
i
want
to
make
three
observations
that
this
court
made
2
years
ago
in
the
quill
case,
which
was
the
last
time
this
court
had
an
opportunity
to
analyze
the
commerce
clause
issues
raised
by
sales
and
use
taxes.
first,
the
court
observed
and
reaffirmed
the
bellas
hess
case
in
large
part
because
it
viewed
bellas
hess
as
providing
a
bright
line
rule
here.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
court
now
has
an
opportunity
to
provide
another
bright
line
rule
that
would
greatly
aid
states
in
devising
tax
systems
that
they
could
be
sure
would
satisfy
the
commerce
clause.
the
identical
treatment
in
each
and
every
instance
approach,
the
problem,
from
the
state's
perspective,
of
that
approach
is
the
state
would
have
to
be
clairvoyant
and
try
to
imagine
a
possible
contingency.
well,
could
we
have
any
possible
area
of
unequal
treatment?
i
dare
say
that
the
states
that
have
adopted
the
identical
use
and
sales
tax
rates
in
each
local
jurisdiction
probably
thought
that
they
had
solved
the
constitutional
problem
of...
that
if
there
was
a
constitutional
problem,
they
have
outlawed
any
unequal
treatment.
well,
the
example
that
i
gave
you
a
few
minutes
ago
shows
that
that
system
can
result
in
the
same
kind
of
instances
of
unequal
treatment
that
our
system
has,
so
it
would
be
much
easier
for
the
state
to
say,
listen,
we
have
a
tax
on
interstate
commerce,
we
have
a
tax
on
intrastate
commerce.
as
long
as
the
tax
on
interstate
commerce
is
not
greater
than
the
tax
on
local
commerce,
on
an
average
basis,
the
tax
is
constitutional.
unless,
of
course,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
to...
unless,
of
course,
there
was
an
identifiable
market
segment
or
industry
that
was
singled
out
for
special
protection,
as
was
the
case
in
the
bacchus
case.
mr.
don
m.
downing
your
honor,
i'm
no
certain
of
how
various
other
states
perform
the
task
of
collection.
i'm
not
certain
whether
it
goes
to
the
county
or
the
state,
like
it
does
in
our
system.
mr.
don
m.
downing
it's...
you're
right,
your
honor.
we
had
the
benefit
of
looking
at
what
other
states
have
done,
and
also
the
input
from
the
interstate
firms
that
were
involved
in
the
quill
case,
so
we
were
fully
cognizant
of
what
other
states
had
done
when
we
devised
our
system.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
from
the
quill
case
is,
the
court
recognized
that
the
critical
importance
of
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
in
the
area
of
state
taxation,
for
at
least
67
years,
the
overall
burden
approach
has
been
firmly
embedded
in
this
court's
precedents.
for
the
court
now
to
change
that
rule
would
raise
all
sorts
of
new
questions
and
undoubtedly
engender
substantial
litigation
over
the
validity
of
a
whole
host
of
state
taxes
that
had
been
enacted
during
that
time
period.
i
would
submit
that
the
court
need
not
open
that
can
of
worms
here.
the
third
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
quill
is
the
point
i
made
before.
congress
has
plenary
power
in
this
area,
as
the
court
recognized
in
quill.
if
it
wanted
to,
it
could
outlaw
the
missouri
system.
it
has
chosen
not
to
for
the
last
67
years...
the
overall
burden
approach...
and
so
therefore
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
unless
there
is
a
clear,
adverse
effect
on
interstate
commerce
overall,
the
court
should
be
hesitant
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
in
this
area.
