we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
92-1510,
michael
cavanaugh
v.
gary
lee
roller.
mr.
lundberg,
mr.
fairey,
the
court
would
like
to
hear
a
discussion
of
what
mootness
problems
may
be
raised
by
the
statutory
amendment
that
you
have
called
to
our
attention.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
wonder
how
much
of
a
practical
help...
that
is
ordinarily
a
case
that
is
argued
in
the
november
arguments
probably
would
not
be
decided
until
after
january
1
here,
so
that
we're
talking
not
just
about
today,
but
we
have
to
talk
too
about
the
possibility
of
our
court
not
having
finished
its
work
on
the
case
until
after
the
first
of
january.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
our
test,
isn't
it?
it
has
to
involve
these
particular
parties,
the
possibility
of
repetition,
not
just
repetition
of
the
issue
against
the
south
carolina
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
weaver
against
graham?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
while
you're
on
parole
in
south
carolina
you're
still,
you're
serving
your
sentence
still?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
a
practical
matter
it's
certainly
a
benefit
because
you're
able
to
walk
around
and
so
forth
rather
than
be
confined.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lundberg,
do
you
have
any
opinion
as
to
whether
if
we
were
to
decide
this
case
is
not
moot
and
were
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
say
that
is
not
the
law
under
the
federal
constitution,
would
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
then
follow
our
view,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lundberg.
we'll
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
fairey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
couldn't
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
say
although
the
fourth
circuit's
judgment
in
roller
has
been
vacated
because
of
mootness,
we
found
it
persuasive
before
and
we
still
find
it
persuasive.
we
are
going
to
stick
to
our
opinion
in
griffin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fairey,
if
you
prevail
here
i
suppose
the
next
case
will
be
that
some
change
adverse
to
the
prisoner
in
a
case
of
administrative
segregation
within
the
prison
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
do
you
think
that
can
be
distinguished
from
parole?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
opponent
says
that
parole
has
no
effect
on
the
length
of
sentence,
that
the
sentence
technically
remains
the
same.
granted,
he
is
free
to
walk
around.
i
suppose
the
same
argument
could
be
made
that
someone
in
administrative
segregation,
though
they
are
serving
the
sentence
the
same,
is
not
nearly
as
free
as
someone
who
is
outside
of
administrative
segregation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that
was
based
on
the
entitlement
argument--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--not
on
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
difference
between
serving
your
sentence
in
prison
and
parole
is
a
substantial
difference,
whereas
the
difference
between
serving
part
of
your
sentence
in
administrative
segregation
and
the
general
prison
population
is
not
a
substantial
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
have
to
report
to
your
parole
officer,
you
probably
can't,
you
can't
commit
any
crime,
you
can't
do
lots
of
things
when
you're
on
parole
that
a
free
citizen
could.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fairey.
mr.
lundberg,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
we
simply
decide
the
case
is
moot
and
are
trying
to
decide
on
one
procedural
disposition
of
the
case
or
another,
certainly
we
will
not
have
decided
the
merits
in
such
a
way
as
to
overturn
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lundberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
cavanaugh
versus
roller
no.
92-1510,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
