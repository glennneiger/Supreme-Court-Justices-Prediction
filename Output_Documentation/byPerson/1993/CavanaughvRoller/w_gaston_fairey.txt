mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
as
to
the
mootness
issue,
i
find
myself
somewhat
torn.
we
were
successful
in
the
fourth
circuit.
this
was
a
pro
se
complaint
by
a
prisoner
who
was
denied
parole
initially
and
then
told
rather
than
the
1-year
period
he
had
to
wait
for
reconsideration
he
had
to
wait
2.
he
then
brought
a
habeas,
excuse
me,
a
1983
action
in
district
court,
pro
se,
lost.
appealed
it
pro
se
to
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
called
and
asked
would
i
consider
being
appointed
and
take
the
case
on
his
behalf.
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
the
change
from
the
1
year
to
the
2
year
violated
the
constitution.
that
conflicted
with
a
south
carolina
supreme
court
case
called
gunter
in
which
both
the
state
and
the
federal
ex
post
facto
clauses
were
considered
and
found
that
that
1
to
2
year
change
was
not
a
substantive
change,
therefore
it
did
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clauses.
the
fourth
circuit,
as
i
said,
reversed,
and
that
is
how
we
are
here
now.
since
that
reversal
by
the
fourth
circuit
certain
things
have
occurred
which
have
been
initiated
by
the
state,
by
both
the
legislative
branch
of
the
state
and
the
judicial
branch
of
the
state.
only
the
executive
branch
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
not
accepted
the
judgment
of
the
roller
court
of
the
fourth
circuit
as
to
ex
post
facto
and
the
statute.
first
the
legislature,
as
we
have
found
out,
has
amended
the
statute
and
in
effect
accorded
all
individuals
sentenced
under
the
old
scheme
their
rights
consistent
with
the
ruling
in
roller.
secondly,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
reconsidered
their
ruling
in
gunter
in
griffin.
and
they
did
not
feel
compelled
to
do
so,
they
were
aware
at
that
time
that
roller
was
pending
before
this
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
state
petitioned
for
rehearing
based
upon
this
case.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
they
were
convinced
by
the
ruling
in
roller
that
it
was
consistent
with
their
understanding
of
what
ex
post
facto,
at
least
now
what
ex
post
facto
means.
that
case
was
brought
and
the
ruling
was
consistent
with
both
the
state
and
the
federal
constitution.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
used
the
little
case
ex
post
facto
rather
than
the
ex
post
facto
clause
usually
used
when
referring
to
the
constitutional
provisions.
so
it
is
our
position
that
while
this
case
may
be
moot
or
close
to
moot,
it
is
done
by
the
state
and
the
usual
remedy
applicable
that
the
state
has
cited,
the
munsingwear
case
and
the
los
angeles
v.
davis
case,
is
not
appropriate
for
this
case.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
justice
ginsburg,
maybe
i'm
not
being
clear.
it's
not
that
i
don't
think
the
case
may
be
moot.
it's
the
usual
remedy
of
this
court
i
don't
think
is
appropriate
under
these
circumstances.
in
munsingwear
this
court
indicated
that
if
one
party
takes
steps
to
cause
the
ending
of
the
case,
they
can't
complain
when
it
is
used
against
them
in
res
judicata.
here
the
state
has
accepted
the
ruling
of
the
fourth
circuit,
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative.
now
they
want
to
make
this
case
moot,
yet
they
want
no
precedent
against
them.
the
usual
remedy
is
to
remand
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
to
order
them
to
dismiss
the
action
as
if
it
never
occurred,
which
obviously
would
have
no
precedential
effect
if
the
south
carolina
legislature
were
in
february
to
decide
to
change
the
law
back.
mr.
roller,
unless
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
were
to
indicate
that
it
was
based
upon,
their
ruling
was
based
upon
the
state
constitution,
would
be
back
in
the
same
position
again.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
they
very
possibly
could,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
there
is
no
guarantee
they
would.
and
i
think
the
precedent
of
having
a
party
to
a
lawsuit
being
able
to
avoid
losing,
in
effect,
by
simply
mooting
the
issue,
i
think
is
a
dangerous
one.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
i
agree.
but
if
this
case
is
going
to
be
mooted
because
of
the
legislation
as
opposed
to
the
judgment
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
then
it
is
the
state
adopting
the
ruling...
in
other
words,
mr.
roller
won
in
the
fourth
circuit.
the
state
has
accepted
that,
yet
they
don't
want
precedent
to
that
effect.
my
understanding
under
other
precedent
of
this
court
is
that
just
the
ruling
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
when
they
were
not
absolutely
clear
whether
it
was
under
the
federal
or
state
constitution
does
not
moot
out
this
case.
only
the
legislation
would
do
that.
the
legislation
is
subject
to
change,
obviously.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
akins
v.
snow
i
think
is
along
the
same
principle
as
the
ex
post
facto
in
this
case.
we
view
ex
post
facto
in...
we
think,
like
collins
does,
that
ex
post
facto
is
either
there
or
it
is
not.
it
is
not
a
relative
thing.
to
that
extent
i
agree
with
the
state.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
exactly.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
and
quoted
i
think
thoreau,
"as
if
you
could
kill
time.
"
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
if
you're
going
to
take
that
analysis
i
think
it
is.
our
position
is
that
a
1-year
change
is
just
as
violative
of
ex
post
facto
as
an
8-year
change,
that
any
change
in
the
quantum
of
punishment,
whether
it
be
small
or
large,
violates
the
constitution.
the
issue...
and
i
think
i
understand
where
the
state
is
coming
from.
they
are
saying
in
effect
that
since
you're
not
guaranteed
parole
you
have
no,
let's
say
liberty
interest.
south
carolina
statute
clearly
is
not
similar
to
the
greenholtz
or
to
the
allen
statute
where
you
must
be
paroled.
it
says
you
may
be
paroled.
and
there
may
not
be
a
liberty
interest
in
the
release
on
parole.
but
the
issue
is
not
that.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
right
to
the
consideration
of
the
parole,
is
how
we
see
it.
it
is
similar
to
a
judge
sentencing
someone.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
well,
justice
blackmun,
i
wouldn't
try
to
distinguish
akins
v.
snow.
akins
v.
snow
we
feel
like
supports
our
position.
but
the
sentencing
judge
has
discretion
to
sentence
within
guidelines.
in
south
carolina
in
most
cases
they
have
from
probation
to
the
maximum
sentence.
due
process
doesn't
come
in
unless
they
violate,
go
outside
that
range.
similarly,
a
parole
board
has
that
similar
discretion.
they
have
a
minimum
range
which
is
when
someone
becomes
eligible
for
parole,
and
then
they
have
a
maximum
range,
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
can.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
depending
upon
whether
that
has
an
effect
upon
the
length
of
sentence
the
individual
is
subject
to
incarceration.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
that
issue
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
has
been
considered
by
this
court
and
rejected.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
in
a
series
of
cases,
i
believe.
in
olin...
i
have
them
here
somewhere,
but
there's
a
series
of
cases
where--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
see
where
someone
is
serving
their
sentence
as
having
an
effect
upon
the
punishment
imposed.
i
disagree
with
the
state
that
parole
is
not
a
substantial
difference.
i
think
that
ignores
reality.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
i
would
much
prefer
to
be
in
the
general
population,
but...
yes,
there
is
a
quantitative
difference
in
those
two
things.
one,
you
are,
you
have
freedom.
the
other,
you
do
not.
one
is
like
probation,
the
other
you
are
still
incarcerated.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
i
agree,
but
you
have
freedom,
much
greater
freedom
than
you
would
while
incarcerated.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
a
number
of
instances.
i
think
common
sense
tells
us
that.
the
issue
i
think
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
change
in
the
quantum
of
punishment
by
changing
this
parole
statute.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
i
agree.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
i
agree
there
is
no
right
to
release
on
parole.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
i
think
you
are
getting
dangerously
close
to
my
dividing
point.
i
think
in
many
cases
rather
than
writing
down
these
changes
you
are
talking
about,
justice
scalia,
they
make
that
decision
on
their
own
and
for
a
period
of
time
based
upon
politics.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
they
i
think
you
do
get
back
into
your
analogy--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--not
necessarily.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
it
depends
upon--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--because
what
i
bring
before
you
is
a
situation
where
the
state,
not
the
discretionary
agency,
but
the
state
has
imposed
regulations
upon
the
discretionary
agency.
the
parole
board
has
always
had
the
option
of--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--oh,
yes.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
justice
scalia,
if
they
had
no
rule
and
they
left
it
completely
to
the
discretion
of
the
parole
board,
then
there
would
be
no
right
to
complain
because
there
would
be
no
expectation
and
there
would
be
no
increase.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
if
that
rule
has
the
force
of
law
it
would.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
then
i
think
it
would.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
in
my
opinion,
yes,
if
that
has
the
rule
of
law.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
depending
upon
the...
i
hate
to
be
evasive
to
your
question,
and
i'm
not
trying
to
be.
it
depends
upon--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--i
appreciate
that.
it
depends
upon
what
the
prisoner
and
the
sentencing
court
know
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing.
we
need
to
go
back
to
the
purpose
of
ex
post
facto.
it
is
a
fairness
doctrine.
if
the
prisoner
and
the
sentencing
judge
have
an
expectation
of
the
effect
of
that
sentence
which
includes--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--respectfully,
no,
i
don't
think
i
have.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes,
sir.
if
the
regulation
has
the
force
of
law.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
force
of
law.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
discretionary
guidelines,
that's
a
dichotomy.
discretion
and
guidelines
are
two
different
things.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
then
you
are
getting
into
a
parole
board
v.
allen
situation,
and
a
greenholtz
situation
if
you
have
mandatory
language
in
your
guidelines.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
our
statute,
any
statute
that
sets
up
a
minimal
level
for
parole
eligibility
and
consideration
for
release
is
considered
by
the
sentencing
judge
and
the
prisoner
in
being
sentenced.
changing
that
formula
post-sentencing
violates
ex
post
facto
because
there's
an
expectation
on
both
of
those
people's
part,
the
judge,
the
sentencing
judge
and
the
prisoner,
as
to
what
that
sentence
will
be.
there
is
an
expectation
as
to
when
they
will
be
eligible
for
release,
which
is
what
parole
is.
that
is
what
is
changed
when
you
change
legislatively
or
by
rule
if
it
has
the
effect
of
law.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
not
if
that
was
in
the
statute
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
or,
excuse
me,
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
in
my
view
it
all
goes
back
to
fairness.
if
someone
is
on
notice
of
what
the
effect
of
their
criminal
conduct
is
and
effect
of
what
their
sentence
and
punishment
is,
it's
more
than
just...
punishment
is
not
just
a
sentence.
punishment
is
how
that
sentence
is
effected
upon
this
individual.
if
a
sentence
like
in
this
case
is
over
35
years,
the
earliest
release
is
a
little
less
than
10.
the
only
method
of
that
release
is
parole.
when
you
start
tinkering
with
that,
then
you
are
effecting
reality
of
when
people
get
out
of
prison.
i
mean,
we
could
come
up
with
all
kinds
of
different
dichotomies
of
what
could
happen
and
what
could
be
changed,
but
i
think
it
all
goes
back
to
the
expectation
of
both
the
prisoner
and
the
sentencing
judge,
which
is
the
purpose
of
ex
post
facto,
and
it
goes
back
to
the
original
calder
categories
that
this
enhances
punishment.
and
it
is
done
by
the
state,
it
is
a
penal
statute,
it
is
retrospective,
therefore
it
violates
ex
post
facto.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
because,
justice
ginsburg,
while
we
wish
release,
we
cannot
insist
upon
it.
we
cannot
seek
it.
we
can
simply
seek
the
avenue
of
obtaining
release.
under
preiser
and
its
succeeding
cases,
wolff
and
allen
and
a
whole
series
of
cases,
greenholtz
is
among
them,
particularly
i
think
gerstein
v.
pugh,
this
court
has
entertained
1983
actions
particularly
in
this
area
by
prisoners
that
are
not
seeking
release
but
are
seeking
what
i
think
the
third
circuit
called
the
process
as
opposed
to
the
outcomes.
here
we
are
seeking
the
process.
we
seek
the
hearing,
which
obviously
we
cannot
obtain
release
without.
but
we
seek
simply
the
hearing.
as
the
fourth
circuit
said,
the
parole
board
need
never
release
mr.
roller.
it
simply
need
consider
the
issue
every
year.
so
under
preiser
and
under
its
succeeding
cases,
if
you're
not
seeking
the
actual
release
or
reduction
in
time,
which
we
cannot--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--yes,
ma'am.
the
opportunity
to
have
the
hearing
which
is
the
only
matter
on
which
we
could
obtain
release.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes.
we
have
not.
i
agree.
because
it
is
a
discretionary
determination...
just
as
i
take
a
client
in
front
of
a
sentencing
judge
he
has
no
expectation
of
a
particular
sentence
other
than
in
the
guidelines,
in
other
words
from
probation
to
10
years,
but
he
has
that
expectation.
if
prior
to
me
taking
him
in
front
of
the
judge
that
law
were
to
change
and
say
okay,
now
it's
no
longer
zero
to
10,
now
it's
9
to
10--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--i'm
sorry--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--no.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
i
misspoke.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
you
have
an
expectation
of
consideration.
now
when
i
say
guidelines
i
do
not
mean
parole
guidelines
under
the
federal
system,
i
mean
the
sentencing,
the
ranges
of
the
sentence.
most
states,
our
state
among
them,
do
not
use
parole
guidelines.
we
are
simply
talking
here
about
a
traditional
common
law
parole
situation
that
i
grew
up
practicing
law
under.
and
every
criminal
defendant's
first
question
is
when
am
i
getting
out.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
if
you
have
no
complaint
under
the
ex
post
facto
law,
then
you
have
no
complaint
with
the
state
doing
away
with
parole
after
someone
is
sentenced,
which
to
me
seems
if
it's
not
in
violation
of
ex
post
facto,
i
don't
know
what
the
framers
meant
when
they
passed
ex
post
facto.
and
i
think
it
would
contravene
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
considered
under
ex
post
facto
consideration,
the
realistic
view
or
expectation
of
the
prisoner.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
you
did
the
crime
and
you
got
30
years
with
a
right
under
our
law
to
parole
consideration
at
the
end
of
10,
because
it
says,
our
law
says
you
shall
be
reviewed
for
parole.
not
that
you
may.
you
may
be
released,
you
shall
be
reviewed,
which
in
my
understanding
of
the
hewitt
v.
helms
line
of
cases
creates
a
liberty
interest
in
the
hearing
at
least.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
i
don't
agree
that
it's
not
a
right
that
doesn't
exist.
i
think
there
are
different
types
of
rights
under
our
constitution.
ex
post
facto
is
not
due
process.
ex
post
facto
is
a
right
in
and
of
itself.
it
is
not
in
the
bill
of
rights.
it
is
in
the
constitution,
in
its
body.
it
has
an
ancient,
historical
point.
the
parole
system
is
ancient,
as
is
ex
post
facto.
it
has
its
origins
in
our
common
laws
of
our
states,
as
in
south
carolina.
it
has
traditionally
been
a
manner
in
which
people
have
obtained
their
release
from
custody.
i
don't
think
we
can
put
that
aside
and
say
that
because
it
doesn't
fall
neatly
into
some
due
process
category
that
it
is
not
a
right
and
expectation
that
prisoners
have.
again
i
go
back
to
it
is
similar
in
my
view
to
the
discretion
a
judge
has
in
sentencing,
and
you
can't,
under
lindsey
you
can't
change
that
after
the
fact.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
certainly
they
could--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--for
the
people
sentenced
from
that
point
forward.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
no,
because
they
were
sentenced
under
a
system
that
had
that
as
a
release
mechanism.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
and
vote
him
out.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
yes.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
in
my
view
the
trick
is
to
be
consistent
with
the
constitution.
the
constitution
forbids
one
and
not
the
other.
the
constitution
encourages
getting
rid
of
the
governor.
the
constitution
forbids
changing
the
sentence
after
it
is
imposed.
that
is
my
view
of--
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
--no,
it
does
not.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
because
one
is
the
failure
to
exercise
discretion,
the
other
is
removal
of
the
discretion
entirely,
and
there
is
a
difference
in
those
two
things.
that
a
governor
has
that
discretion
and
doesn't
exercise
it
is
not
the
same...
it's
just
like
a
parole
board
having
the
discretion
to
release
and
deciding
not
to.
but
when
you
take
away
the
right
to
consider
the
release
it
is
a
different
animal,
because
then
you
end
discretion.
there
is
no
argument
that
the
parole
board
need
never
parole
any
individual
person,
but
when
the
state
takes
away
its
opportunity
to
do
that
then
it
violates
ex
post
facto.
parole
is
simply
a
part
of
punishment.
it
has
been.
it
may
change
at
some
point,
but
it
will
have
to
change
prospectively
rather
than
retroactively
is
our
view.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
justice
stevens,
i
do.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
but
i
wish
for
this
court
to
fashion
a
different
remedy
than
the
normal
remedy.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
is
munsingwear.
mr.
w.
gaston
fairey
it
says,
i
believe,
for
the
rule,
they
talk
about
why
they
have
the
rule.
but
it
said
that
those
who
have
prevented
from
obtaining
the
review
to
which
they
are
entitled
should
not
be
treated
as
if
there
has
been
a
review.
in
other
words
if
you're
not
involved
in
ending
the
matter
and
it
becomes
moot,
then
you
have
been
denied
the
right
to
litigate
it
and
have
it
finally
determined.
here
the
state
caused
it
to
end.
they
should
not
be
relieved
of
the
res
judicata
principles
and
the
finality
of
this
judgment.
thank
you.
