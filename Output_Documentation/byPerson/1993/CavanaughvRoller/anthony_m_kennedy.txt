justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
that
you're
here,
is
the
1983
aspect
of
this
suit
at
least
still
alive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
south
carolina
have
a
parallel
provision
in
its
state
constitution
prohibiting
ex
post
facto
laws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
earlier
litigation
did
the
litigants
argue
both
issues
and
then
the
south
carolina
court
just
chose
to
rest
it
on
the
federal
grounds?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
extraordinary
circumstances
come
to
the
attention
of
the
parole
board
can
they
give
a
hearing
under
the
old
rule
sooner
than
1
year,
or
sooner
than
2
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
there
is
a
written
rule
that
you
get
your
parole
hearing
once
every
year,
but
that
also
in
the
rule
it
is
stated
that
the
parole
board
may,
because
of
its
own
work
load
and
personnel
problems,
in
its
discretion
change
this
to
2
years.
and
then
it
changes
to
2
years.
is
there
an
ex
post
facto
violation?
