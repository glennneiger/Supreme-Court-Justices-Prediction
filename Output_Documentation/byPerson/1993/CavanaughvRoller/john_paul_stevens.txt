justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
to
have
a
better
understanding,
you
mentioned
the
conference
committee
apparently
amended
the
legislation
at
the
last
minute.
was
the
amendment
to
which
you
referred
subsection
(b),
subparagraph
(b)
of
section
8,
the
one
that
says
that
it
refers
to
the
time
of
commission
of
the
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
possible
in
your
view
that
the
purpose
of
doing
that
was
to
take
care
of
this
very
litigation
because
we
had
granted
cert
in
the
case,
or
at
least
the
fourth
circuit
had
decided
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
this
make
the
punishment
more
burdensome
when
one
is
eligible
for
parole
after
a
period
of
time
and
later
on
he's
not
eligible.
isn't
that
a
more
burdensome
punishment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
a
state
had,
say
a
30-year
sentence
for
a
particular
crime
for
everybody
and
at
the
end
of
1/3
of
the
sentence
the
person
was
eligible
for
parole
and
routinely
parole
was
granted,
they
then
abolish
parole
entirely
so
that
everybody
has
to
start
serving
their
full
30-year
sentences,
what
would
you
say
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
practical
sense,
when
would
he
be
entitled
to
his
next
hearing
had
the
statute
been
in
effect
all
along,
the
1-year
provision
been
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
under
a
1-year
cycle
sometime
in
1993
he
would
be
receiving
his
next
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
we
didn't
decide
the
case
for
6
months
for
some
reason,
we
got
slow
about
our
work
or
something.
isn't
it
true
that
under
the
prevailing
ruling
of
both
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
state
supreme
court
you
would
have
to
give
him
his
hearing
in
1993,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
within
1993.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
take
it
so
far
as
these
practicalities
are
concerned
the
same
would
be
true
if
we
came
down
with
a
decision
against
you
tomorrow
morning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
of
one
thing?
you
probably
said
it
at
the
beginning
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
do
you
agree
that
this
case
will
be
moot
on
january
1
if
it
isn't
decided
by
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
changes
one
thing.
it
requires
them
to
hold
hearings
at
certain
intervals
that
they
wouldn't
otherwise
have
had
to
hold.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
on
whether
you
get
out
on
parole
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
like
you've
got
a
right
to
file
a
lawsuit
you
aren't
necessarily
going
to
win,
but
you
have
a
right
to
file
it.
