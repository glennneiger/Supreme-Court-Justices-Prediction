justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
lundberg,
before
you
start,
when
was
the
south
carolina
statute
passed,
the
statute
that
raises
this
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
come
in
here
with
a
four
and
a
half
month
old
statute
and
present
it
to
us
the
eve
of
argument.
you
surely
don't
practice
law
that
way
in
south
carolina,
do
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
other
states
i
think
have
daily
legislative
service
that
enable
lawyers
to
keep
up
with
what
is
going
on
in
the
legislature.
it
is
a
little
awkward
to
have
as
old
a
statute
as
this
come
in
here
the
day
before
we
argue.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
lundberg,
do
you
have
any
comment
about
akins
against
snow
in
the
eleventh
circuit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
fairey,
you
don't
cite
the
case
of
akins
against
snow.
your
opponent
cites
it
both
in
his
main
brief
and
in
the
reply
brief,
struggles
with
it,
perhaps
successfully,
perhaps
not.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
an
argument
could
be
made
that
is
precisely
the
same
as
this
case
except
7
years
against
1.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
rather
a
slippery
slope,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
recognize
the
issue,
but
i
am
not
sure
you
have
distinguished
the
case.
but
go
ahead.
