justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lundberg,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
now
agrees
with
the
fourth
circuit
and
has
rejected
your
argument
on
the
merits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
was
the
legislation,
the
recent
legislative
change
in
south
carolina,
responsive
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
south
carolina
was
following
what
they
took
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
u.s.
constitution
based
on
what
the
fourth
circuit
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
legislative
change
in
fact
came
first?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
was
not
aware
of
the
legislative
change
as
far
as
you
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
staying
with
your
ex
post
facto,
with
the
merits
point,
do
i
grasp
your
position
on
mootness
correctly
that
if
you
were
here
after
january
1
there
would
be
no
argument
that
you
could
make
that
this
case
is
not,
that
the
question
on
the
merits
is
not
moot?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
not
for
the
south
carolina
supreme
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
may
be
so
when
we're
dealing
just
with
an
executive
decision
to
turn
something
on
or
off,
but
now
that
there's
a
legislative
change
by
the
south
carolina
legislature
do
you
have
any
precedent
that
says
when
the
legislature
change
that
exception
to
mootness
applies,
that
is
for
voluntary
cessation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
was
not
bound
by
what
the
fourth
circuit
said,
so
if
it
followed
it
it
was
only
because
it
was
persuaded
by
the
reasoning
of
the
fourth
circuit,
and
that
same
reasoning
would
stand
even
if
the
fourth
circuit
decision
is
vacated.
that
is
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
already
adopted
that
reasoning,
it
is
part
of
its
own
jurisprudence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
enhances
punishment
then
why
don't
you
lose
on
your
threshold
argument,
that
is
that
this
is
the
improper
form
in
which
to
cast
this
action,
that
it
has
to
be
habeas
because
you
are
talking
about
increased
punishment,
not
a
mere
procedural
matter,
and
therefore
you
should
bring
it
under
habeas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
seeking
the
opportunity
to
be
released.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
best
authority
for
saying
that
the
munsingwear
vacation
should
not
follow
in
this
case
is
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
munsingwear
itself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
position
on
the
munsingwear
vacation
is
that
it
ought
to
be
vacated
even
though
the
state
was
the
party
that
changed
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
goes
in
lock
step
with
the
fourth
circuit
on
questions
of
federal
constitutional
law?
