justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lundberg,
suppose
the
statute,
suppose
you
had
a
statute
that
said
anyone
convicted
of
a
crime
will
be
eligible
for
parole
after
1
year,
and
then
the
statute
is
amended
to
say
that
person
will
be
eligible
for
parole
only
after
10
years.
would
that
be,
if
applied
retroactively
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fairey,
you
agree
that
there
is
no
entitlement
to
the
parole.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
purely
discretionary.
you
come
up
in
2
years
and
you
could
not
sue
if
they
don't
give
you
the
parole,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
okay.
now,
suppose
the
parole
statute
is
not
changed
to
say
you
get
a
hearing
every
2
years,
but
what
happens
is
the
standards
that
the
parole
board
has
traditionally
been
applying,
which
are
written
down,
are
changed
to
be
much
more
harsh,
so
that
in
point
of
fact
whereas
they
would
have
paroled
you
on
a
30-year
sentence
previously
after
8
years,
they
now
announce
in
the
new
rule
that
they
will
not
parole
you
until
15
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
answer
if
it's
written
down?
it
used
to
be
if
x,
y,
and
z
exist
you
are
out
in
8
years.
under
the
new
ones
no
one
gets
out
until
15
years
for
this
particular
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
any
different
from
what
you
bring
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see,
so
all
that
the
state
had
to
do
would
be
to
leave
it
up
to
the
parole
board
how
frequently
they
wanted
their
hearings--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
if
they
used
to
have
them
every
1
year
by
regulation
but
they
decide
that
in
the
future
they're
going
to
have
them
every
2
years,
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
parole
board
has
adopted
a
rule,
and
you
say
changing
the
parole
board's
own
rule
would
not
count
for
ex
post
facto
purposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
of
course.
of
course
it
has
the
force
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
binds
the
parole
board.
the
parole
board
can
change
it,
but
as
long
as
it's
in
effect
the
parole
board
is
bound
by
it.
and
you
can
say
that
if
they
change
their
own
rule
from
1
year
to
2
years
that
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
now
answer
my
question.
now
suppose
they
have
a
rule
that
says
we
will
normally,
we
will
grant
parole
if
x,
y,
and
z
factors
exist
after
8
years,
and
they
change
that
rule
and
say
we're
going
to
be
tougher,
we
will
not
grant
parole
for
anybody
in
this
situation,
even
if
x,
y,
and
z
exist,
until
15
years.
they
have
just
changed
their
standard
of
discretion.
does
that
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
succeeding
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
do.
you
have
conceded
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
the
legislature
that
does
it
or
the
parole
board
that
does
it,
right?
you
have
conceded
that.
so
long
as
it's
a
rule,
you
have
conceded
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
did.
i
thought
you
initially
said
that
if
you
changed
from
1
to
2
years
by
statute
it
was
bad,
but
if
the
parole
board
did
it
it
was
good.
and
then
i
said
suppose
the
parole
board
does
it
by
regulation,
and
you
said
oh,
well,
if
the
regulation
is
binding
then
it
would
be
bad.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
state
does
it
by
legislation
or
by
agency
rule,
so
long
as
it
has
the
force--
justice
antonin
scalia
--force
of
law,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now
suppose
the
parole
board
discretionary
guidelines
have
the
force
of
law,
they
are
bound
by
it,
and
they
change
those
guidelines
so
as
to
make
their
discretion
harsher.
justice
antonin
scalia
call
them
regulations
then.
they
say
we
will
grant
parole
and
they
are
bound
by
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
have
no
expectation,
no
legal
expectation
with
regard
to
the
outcome
of
that
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
guidelines
are
mandatory
and
appealable.
that's
not
at
all
like
parole.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
no
cause
of
action
if
parole
is
denied
even
though
you
are
the
most
desirable,
eligible
candidate
for
parole
in
the
world.
right?
can
you
bring
it
to
court
and
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
if
anybody
deserved
parole,
i
did?
you
come
to
court
and
the
court
says
get
out
of
here.
so
what
is
your
expectation?
zero.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
have
your
expectations
been
changed
by
changing
your
hearing
from
1
year
to
2
year?
you
had
no
expectation
to
start
off
with,
now
you
have
that
expectation,
that
non-expectation
less
frequently.
i
don't
see
how
that
puts
you
in
a
worse
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know,
and
we
talk
as
though
there
is
some
legal
expectation
there,
but
there
is
none
or
else
you'd
be
able
to
bring
a
lawsuit
to
get
out
if
you
were
a
good
parole
candidate,
and
you
can't.
that
means
to
me
that
this
is
a
matter
of
clemency,
that
it
has
always
been
treated
as
clemency.
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
don't
see
how
you
have
any
complaint
under
the
ex
post
facto
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
have
to
speak
of
legal
expectation.
i
mean,
yes,
he
might
get
a
break
and
he
hoped
he
would
get
a
break.
that's
just
like
saying
i
expected
to
have
a
lenient
judge
when
i
was
put
on
trial
and
they
switched
the
judge
on
me
just
before
the
case
began
and
i
have,
you
know,
maximum
john
for
my
sentencing
judge.
in
a
way
you
can
say
your
expectation
was
upset,
but
it's
not
a
legal
expectation.
and
the
law's
answer
to
that
is
that's
too
bad.
you
did
the
crime,
you
got
30
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
a
right
that
does
not
exist
can
be
turned
into
a
right
by
saying
that
you'll
get
a
hearing
on
it
every
2
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
people
you
say
could
not
put
in
a
new,
people
cannot
get
fed
up
with
parole
and
put
in
a
new
legislature
that
abolishes
parole
and
say
no
more
parole?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can't
do
that.
they
can't
apply
that
to
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
not
for
people
who
are
in
jail
already,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
although
the
people
can
get
fed
up
with
a
governor
who,
i
suppose,
who
commutes
all
death
sentences--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
vote
him
out
and
put
in
a
new
governor.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
can't
do
the
same...
and
that
wouldn't
violate
the
ex
post
facto
laws
because
even
though
you
committed
your
murder
before
the
new
governor
got
in.
so
the
trick
is
whether
it's
a
new
governor
or
new
legislature?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
see,
the
governor
is
saying
i
know
that
i
don't
have
to
commute
death
sentences,
it's
discretionary,
but
i
am
choosing
to
do
it.
i
am
elected
by
the
people
and
i
am
choosing
to
do
it.
when
you
put
in
a
new
governor
that
changes
the
policy,
that
doesn't
violate
the
ex
post
facto
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
have
a
legislature
who
says
we
have
this
parole,
we
don't
have
to
give
it
to
you
but
we'll
give
it
to
you,
and
it's
discretionary,
you
have
no
right
to
sue
for
it.
you
get
in
a
new
legislature
who
says
we're
not
going
to
do
that,
and
why
is
that
any
different
from
clemency
by
the
governor
and
clemency
by
the
legislature?
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
why
doesn't
the
state
supreme
court's
decision
continue
that
effect?
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
a
matter
of
being
an
independent
state
ground,
but
it's
a
matter
of
being
independent
reasoning
by
the
judges
of
the
state
court,
and
they
came
to
that
conclusion
as
to
what
the
federal
law
means,
which
they
are
entitled
to.
