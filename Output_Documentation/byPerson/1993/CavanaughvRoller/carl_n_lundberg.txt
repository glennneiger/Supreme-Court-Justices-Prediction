mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
the
statute
was
passed
in
june
of
this
year,
but
we
didn't
know
about
it,
my
colleagues
and
i,
nor
the
corrections
community,
nobody
was
aware
of
it
until
friday
of
this
past
week.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
no,
your
honor,
but
in
south
carolina
this
past
legislative
season
we
had
a
massive
restructuring
of
state
government
and
we
had
a
large
number
of
laws...
i
have
a
copy
on
my
desk
that
was
the
earliest
draft
i
could
get
of
this
classification
bill,
and
on
the
draft
that
i
have
it
doesn't
have
this
provision
in
it.
we
have
checked
up
on
that
on
friday
to
find
out
how
it
got
added,
and
it
was
added
in
the
conference
committee
but
copies
of
the
bill
were
not
available
for
us
to
see
until
the
advance
sheets
came
out.
so
i
had
no
knowledge
of
it,
although
i
had
looked
at
the
draft
that
i
had
of
the
classification
bill.
mr.
fairey
wasn't
aware
of
it,
nor
was
my
co-counsel.
one
of
our
colleagues
at
the
attorney
general's
office
had
gotten
a
copy
of
the
advance
sheets,
had
taken
it
home
and
was
reading
it,
and
noticed
that
provision
and
the
application
to
this
case
and
called.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
very
awkward
for
me
too.
i
made
every
effort
to
keep
abreast
of
this
statute
that
was
available
to
me
at
the
time,
including
computerized
access
at
the
legislation,
but
it
wasn't
physically
available
for
me
to
read.
it
was
a
very
unusual
legislative
year
and
i
can't
offer
any
other
explanation
to
that
other
than
that
we
were
diligent
to
keep
up
with
this
law.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
until
january
1
of
1994
all
the
issues
are
alive
in
this
case.
as
of
january
1
of
1994,
when
this
new
legislation
goes
into
effect,
it
will
then
retroactively
on
the
one
section
make
this
case
moot
as
to
the
rescheduling
of
parole
consideration
hearings.
but
it
is
live
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
today
it
is
live
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
ex
post
facto
clause
applies
to
parole
procedures
and
the
interval
between
parole
consideration
hearings
in
the
first
place.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
is
not
one
which
i
can
say
could
not
necessarily
be
repeated
because
it
involves
the
procedure
involved
in
paroling
procedures
in
general,
and
so
i
assume
that
some
place
along
the
line
that
a
paroling
procedure
case
could
again
come
up
in
front
of
this
court,
but
a
case
such
as
this
particular
one
might
not
be
able
to
be
raised
and
therefore
maybe
mootness
could
be,
wouldn't
be
an
objection
to
this
court
making
a
decision
on
it.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
in
addition,
since
there
has
been
no
publicity,
no
one
in
the
corrections
field,
no
one
in
the
probation
field,
no
one
in
the
general
public,
as
strange
as
it
may
seem,
has
had
an
opportunity
to
be
aware
of
this
particular
piece
of
legislation,
and
now
that
the
advance
sheets
are
out
it
may
be
that
the
general
assembly
will
find
some
concern
about
the
effect
of
this
legislation
and
it
may
be
that
they
will
be
altering
the
legislation
in
the
near
future.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
no,
your
honor,
the
amendment
that
i
referred
to
was
in
the
section
that
made
it
active,
that's
section
266
that
says
that
the
retroactive
effect
of
16-1-60(b),
that
that
section
will
be
retroactive.
the
law
that
came
in
had
the
amendment
that
brought
in
16-1-60(b)
that
changed
the
definition
of
a
violent
crime,
the
offender
to
whom
would
be
considered
a
violent
offender.
but
then
the
part
that
was
stuck
in
was
stuck
in
in
266
to
make
that
one
specific
section
retroactive,
where
the
rest
of
the
statute
was
prospective.
that
was
the
part
that
i
was
unaware
of,
was
the
retroactive.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
i
can't
answer
what's
in
the
mind
of
legislature,
but
i
doubt
very
seriously
that
it
was
in
their
mind
or
that
they
were
even
aware
of
it.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
he
has
not
had
a
hearing
this
year.
so,
the
questions
that
have
been
presented
here
in
this
case
for
review
are
whether
or
not
the
change
in
the
interval
between
parole
consideration
hearings
from
1
year
to
2
years,
which
came
after
the
respondent's
crime,
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
and
whether
or
not
the
respondent's
claim
is
cognizable
under
section
1983
instead
of
under
habeas
corpus.
the
change
in
an
interval
between
a
parole
consideration
hearing
from
1
year
to
2
years
does
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
the
change
involves
a
part
of
procedure
that
is
involved
in
the
parole
decision
making
process.
in
other
words,
in
south
carolina
this
is
a
change
which
is
involved
in
a
form
of
clemency
in
the
state
of
south
carolina.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
under
the
proposition
that
i
am
saying,
i
think
that
it
would
not
make
any
difference
because
if
the
ex
post
facto
clause
does
not
apply,
then
it
would
not
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
an
ex
post
facto
analysis
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
hearing
in
1
year
or
20
years.
the
fourth
circuit's
reasoning
making
the
change
in
the
interval
between
parole
consideration
hearings
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
presents
a
large
number
of
other
problems
for
a
state
such
as
south
carolina.
for
example,
would
an
increase
in
the
board
size
constitute
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
or
would
a
change
from
a
majority
vote
to
a
2/3
majority
vote
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
or
what
about
a
smaller
change
like
from
21
months
to
2
years
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
it
is
my
position
that
none
of
these
changes,
including
a
change
from
1
year
to
2
years
in
the
frequency
of
parole
consideration
hearings
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
well,
your
honor,
the
position
that
i
am
taking
is
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
does
not
apply
to
the
scheduling
between
parole
consideration
hearings,
and
the
logical
extension
of
that
position
is
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
does
not
apply
to
parole
eligibility
period.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
period.
and
the
case
that
i
rely
on
from
this
court
is
collins
v.
youngblood.
in
collins
v.
youngblood
this
court
said,
in
reaffirming
the
beazell
case,
beazell
v.
ohio,
that
to
the
best
of
this
court's
understanding
it
correctly
reflected
the
original
understanding
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
and
that
understanding,
as
we
all
know,
involves
that
you
can't
make
a
crime
that
was,
make
an
act
which
was
innocent
a
crime
after
the
fact
or
increase
the
punishment
or
make
more
burdensome
the
punishment
or
change
the
rules
of
evidence
in
such
a
way
as
to--
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
--no,
the
punishment
that
is
prescribed
in
the
statute
is
for
a
fixed
number,
is
for
whatever
is
allowed
in
the
statute.
in
this
particular
case
the
respondent
had
a
35-year
sentence.
that
sentence
was
pronounced
by
the
legislature.
what
is
going
on
in
the
paroling
process
is
a
form
of
clemency,
but
this
court
has
said
on
a
couple
of
occasions
that
the
paroling
process
does
not
change
the
sentence.
in
lindsey
v.
washington
an
argument
was
made
involving
an
indeterminant
scheme
of
sentencing
and
then
a
change
to
a
fixed
sentence,
and
since
the
fixed
sentence
was
the
same
as
the
maximum
in
the
indeterminant
sentence
the
state
took
the
position
that
there
was
no
violation.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
sentence,
if
it
were
30
years,
remains
30
years,
and
the
fact
that
the
situs
of
the
service
of
the
sentence
might
change
doesn't
change
the
sentence.
the
paroling
process
doesn't
change
the
sentence,
and
you
have
said
that
in
this
court
on
a
couple
of
occasions.
you
also
made
that
mention
in
a
parole
guidelines
case
of
portley
v.
grossman
where
you
said
that
the
change
in
the
paroling
guidelines,
even
though
it
kept
the
person
in
jail
longer,
that
it
did
not
implicate
the
ex
post
facto
clause
and
it
wasn't
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
you
do
understand
correctly.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
no,
it
was
not.
the
legislation
took
place
in
june,
the
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
took
place
in
august,
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
decision
was
based
on
no
independent
state
ground.
it
solely
relates
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
circuits
had
taken
this
position
and
so
they
followed
the
federal
circuit
and
changed
the
south
carolina
law.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
that's
my
interpretation
of
the
case,
your
honor,
yes.
that's
what
i
think
was
done
in
the
griffin
case.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
that's
correct.
but
as
hard
as
it
may
be
to
believe,
no
one
saw
the
legislative
change
except
those
people
who
were
physically
involved
in
the
writing
up
of
it.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
that
is
exactly
correct,
they
were
not
aware.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
yes.
the
akins
case
v.
snow
i
think
has
been,
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
one
of
them
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
ex
post
facto
clause
applies
at
all.
the
second
problem
is
that
in
the
akins
case
the
eleventh
circuit
took
the
position
that
the
georgia
statute,
the
way
it
was
written
made
the
interval
between
parole
considerations
a
part
of
parole
eligibility,
and
then
took
the
position
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
applies
to
parole
eligibility
and
since
the
georgia
statute
intended
to
make
the
interval
between
parole
considerations
a
part
of
parole
eligibility,
that
it
violated
the
ex
post
facto
clause
and
they
struck
it
down.
the
problem
for
all
of
these
cases,
the
snow
case,
akin
v.
snow,
and
a
large
number
of
other
cases
is
that
the
circuits
are
not
in
agreement
and
there
is
disagreement
between
the
district
courts
and
the
circuit
courts,
the
courts
of
appeal,
and
between
the
courts
of
appeal.
if
this
court
were
to
take
a
clear
statement
and
say
whether
or
not
the
ex
post
facto
clause
applies
at
all
to
these
parole
eligibility
procedures,
this
problem
would
be
resolved
and
we
wouldn't
have
these
kinds
of
cases.
that's
the
position
that
i
am
taking
here.
another
thing
in
the
collins
case,
in
the
concurring
opinion
to
the
collins
case
this
court
set
forth
a
test
that
might
be
looked
at
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
procedure
actually
violated
or
implicated
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
that
test
is
this,
that
you
look
at
the
procedure
from
the
time
when
the
act
was
committed,
and
if
that
procedure
changes
the
obtaining
of
a
valid
conviction
or
sentence
then
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
implication.
from
there
the
analysis
would
go
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
substantial
disadvantage.
well,
when
you
do
that,
if
you
go
back
to
the
time
when
the
respondent
committed
his
crime
and
you
look
at
the
procedural
change,
the
change
in
the
frequency
between
parole
consideration
hearings
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
obtaining
a
valid
conviction
or
the
sentence.
his
sentence
is
not
altered
by
whether
or
not
he
has
gained
parole.
he
has...
in
this
state
he
has
absolutely
no
expectation
of
parole.
that
is
part
of
his
argument
that
he
says
makes
him
go
into
1983,
is
the
fact
that...
but
he
hasn't
shown
any
entitlement
to
a
fixed
hearing
date.
there
is
no
constitutional
protection.
this
court
said
in
the
greenholtz
case,
greenholtz
v.
the
inmates
of
nebraska
penal
commission,
this
court
said
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
nor
inherent
right
to
be
released
conditionally
prior
to
the
expiration
of
a
sentence.
and
so
the
position
that
this
court
has
taken
all
the
way
through,
i
have
been
unable
to
find,
nor
have
i
seen
anything
cited
in
this
case,
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
anything
that
is
contrary
that
in
anyway
would
implicate
the
ex
post
facto
clause
in
this
analysis.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
weaver
against
graham
was
a,
although
they
used
the
term
gain
time,
it
was
a
good
time
credit
scheme.
it
involved
an
automatic
scheme
whereby
a
person
would
be,
his
sentence
would
be
shortened.
the
legislature
replaced
that
scheme
by
putting
in
a
discretionary
good
time
credit
scheme,
and
even
though
the
amount
of
good
time
credit
might
have
been
greater
under
the
discretionary
scheme
it
required
affirmative
acts
on
the
part
of
the
inmate.
under
the
prior
scheme
it
required
no
acts,
and
the
result
was
that
their
sentence
in
absolute
terms
would
be
shortened.
so
this
court
held
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
was
involved,
but
again
we're
talking
about
an
actual
reduction
in
sentence
whereas
with
paroling
in
south
carolina,
if
you
are
granted
parole
it
is
not
a
reduction
in
sentence.
it
is
a
form
of
clemency.
they
still
have
to
be
supervised
by
the
state.
the
purpose
of
paroling
has
nothing
to
do
with
punishment.
it's
an
administrative,
executive
type
of
a
program.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
continue
to
serve
your
sentence.
it
doesn't
accelerate
the
sentence
satisfaction.
there
is
no
benefit
to
being
on
parole
except
having
a
change
in
the
situs
of
the
place
of
service
of
the
sentence.
and
it
is
a
form
of
clemency.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
every
change,
every
procedural
change
that
takes
place,
assuming
that
there
was
a
violation,
the
ex
post
facto
clause
was
implicated,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's
addressable
or
actionable.
dobbert
v.
florida
is
a
case
that
makes
that
point,
and
there
are
others
from
this
court
that
have
made
that
point.
so
the
threshold
problem
is
whether
or
not
the
ex
post
facto
clause
applies
at
all.
if
the
ex
post
facto
clause
does
apply,
then
you've
got
to
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
respondent
can
bring
the
action
under
1983
rather
than
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
preiser
v.--
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
after
january
1,
assuming
no
legislative
change,
i
have
no
argument
to
make.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
he
became
eligible
for
parole,
your
honor...
and
i
don't
know,
that's
another
point.
this
statute
that
affected
the
frequency
of
hearing
went
into
effect
before
he
became
eligible
for
parole,
but
after
his
sentence.
he
was
heard
originally
in
1990
and
the
2-year
statute
was
applied
to
him
and
he
was
heard
again
in
1992.
the
griffin
case
came
down
in
august
and
the
department
is
in
the
process
of
scheduling
all
the
hearings
for
all
people
affected
by
the
griffin
case.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
assuming
that
administratively
they
have
enough
spaces
to
get
him
heard.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
yes,
i
think
we
have
to
give
him
his
hearing.
we
haven't
been
told
that
we
have
to
give
it
to
him
on
a
fixed
particular
date.
i
think
administratively--
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
--to
do
our
best
to
comply
with
the
court's
order,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
administratively
we're
in
the
process
of
trying
to
accomplish
that.
but
practically
speaking,
because
of
the
way
that
the
paroling
system
is
administrated,
they
are
scheduled,
as
i
speak
they
have
every
case
set
up
clear
through
may
of
1994
right
now.
they
have
booked
in
all
their
cases
through
that
time.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
well,
i
think
we
would,
your
honor.
i
mentioned--
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
--well,
we
have
done
our
best
to
comply
with
the
order,
but
the
way,
unless
we
have
more
resources
we
just
physically
don't
have
the
time.
we
literally,
i
checked
this
before
i
came
up
here,
they
have
every
single
space
available,
they
hear
like
60
cases
in
a
day
and
they
have
every
single
space
booked
up
through
may
and
they
are
starting
to
book
into
the
subsequent
months.
so
they
would
have
to
put
on
more,
have
more
hearings
than
they
presently
have,
which
means
they'd
have
to
have
more
money,
which
means
they'd
have
to
go
back
to
the
budget
and
control
board
and
follow
those
matters
from
a
practical
point
of
view
in
order
to
provide
more
hearings.
but
within
the
resources--
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
--well,
i
think
so.
also
i
think
that
the
south
carolina
case
was
decided
exclusively
on--
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
--on
federal
grounds,
and
so
i
think
the
decision
by
this
court
reversing
that
would
necessarily,
we
would
ask
them
to
review
it
if
they
didn't
automatically
on
their
own
review
it.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
it
does.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
the
applicant
raised
both
constitutions
in
his
original
pleading
in
the
roller
case.
in
the
griffin
case
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
so
i
can't
answer
in
the
griffin
case
whether
the
state
constitution
was
raised
or
not.
if
this
court
were
to
go
forward
and
find,
i
don't
think
that
you
should
find
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
applies,
but
if
you
did
then
i
think
that
the
fourth
circuit's
case
has
to
be
reversed
because
there's
no
entitlement
to
a
hearing
and
the
scheduling,
there
is
no
loss
of
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
considered
for
parole
under
this
particular
change.
and
if
that
is
going
to
be
determined
to
be
a
right,
going
from
1
year
to
2
years
has
not
deprived
mr.
roller
of
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
considered
for
parole
within
his
sentence.
that's
the
reason
that
we
have
a
scheme
that
provided
for
2
years
for
violent
offenders,
because
they
have
longer
sentences
and
it
takes,
having
a
hearing
every
year
is
not
necessarily
productive
and
from
the
state's
management
point
of
view
of
its
resources
they
don't
want
to
do
that.
and
in
fact
before
the
general
assembly
changed
the
procedure
persons
in
roller's
situation
would
have
had
to
wait
2
years.
if
this
court
were
to
feel
that
this
was
to
be
a
moot
issue,
we
feel
that
under
united
states
v.
munsingwear
that
the
fourth
circuit's
case
ought
to
be
vacated
so
that
it
wouldn't
leave
a
bad
precedent
on
a
moot
issue.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
no,
your
honor,
they
are
fixed
into
1-year
or
2-year
intervals
following
a
rejection.
if
the
person
is
revoked
there
is
no
procedure
set
by
the
general
assembly
and
the
parole
board
sets
its
own
procedure.
it
is
1
year
following
a
rejection,
2
years
following
a
subsequent
rejection
on
the
same
sentence.
but
there
is
no
provision
to
expedite
hearings
other
than
if
they
would
create
one,
but
they
don't
have
anything
in
their
board
manual
for
expediting
hearings.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
make
two
points.
it
was
said
that
parole
is
not
a
change
in
the
sentence
and
that
parole
is
not
a
punishment.
i
think
he
said
that
parole
resulted
in
a
change
of
sentence
by
being
released
and
that
it
was,
in
effect
changed
the
punishment.
in
south
carolina
there
is
no
right
to
be
released
on
parole.
it
derives
originally
from
the
constitution
which
gave
the
power
to
the
governor
to
grant
clemency
and
to
commute
sentences,
and
that
ultimately
resolved
into
a
change
in
the
constitution
which
then
gave
the
power
as
a
form
of
clemency
to
the
parole
board.
these
changes...
but
it
was
always
an
absolutely
discretionary
decision
and
is
still
an
absolutely
discretionary
decision.
these
changes
which
we're
talking
about
that
have
come
in
by
the
general
assembly
do
not
in
anyway
change
the
discretionary
powers
involved
in
making
this
type
of
a
decision.
they--
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
--yes,
insofar
as
that
they--
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
--to
be
considered,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
but
it
didn't
change
in
anyway
the,
how
the
decision
has
to
be
approached
or
the
result.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
right.
and
that's
how
this
case
got
brought
before
you,
that's
correct.
that's
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
yes.
our
position
on
that
is
that
the
munsingwear
requires
there
to
be
a
vacation
if
the
case
becomes
moot
before
this
decision
is
rendered
and
that
there's
no
other
reason
why
the
case
wouldn't
otherwise
avoid
mootness
and
get
a
decision.
the
fact
that
the
state
was
involved
in
this
particular
issue
doesn't
resolve
the
fact
that
if
the
decision
in
roller
stands
it
has
great
impact
on
all
procedural
changes
to
the
paroling
process.
so
if
this
court
doesn't
vacate
the
roller
decision
in
the
fourth
circuit
it
will
have
a
bad
precedent
in
terms
of
all
procedural
paroling
issues.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
well,
the
state
supreme
court
decision
was
predicated
exclusively
on
a
federal
basis,
and
it's
our
position
that
if
this
court
resolves
that
issue
that--
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
--i
don't
know
how
they
do
in
all
cases.
in
this
case
that
was
the
only
thing
that
they
cited
to
justify
their
retrenchment
from
the
gunter
decision,
where
at
that
time
they
said
that
it
was
a
procedural
matter
and
that
it
was
outside
the
purview
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
along
comes
the
roller
case
and
says
oh,
no,
it's
inside
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
apparently,
from
the
way
that
the
position,
the
case
was
argued,
i
mean
written
in
the
opinions,
say
we
have
to
follow
the
fourth
circuit's
position.
and
they
do.
but
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
independent
state
ground
set
forth
in
the
griffin
case
to
show
why
they
otherwise
did.
all
they
have
done
is
they
have
referred
consistently
to
the
roller
position.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
which
they
are
entitled
to,
but
it's
your
prerogative
to
tell,
to
actually
decide
what
the
federal
law
does
mean
and
whether
or
not
that
decision
was
correct.
mr.
carl
n.
lundberg
no,
but
if
it's
vacated
then
the
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
will
no
longer
have
any
position
from
the
fourth
circuit
to
rely
upon,
and
if
they're
going
to
continue
along
that
same
type
of
an
analysis
they'll
have
to
independently
reach
it.
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
thank
you.
