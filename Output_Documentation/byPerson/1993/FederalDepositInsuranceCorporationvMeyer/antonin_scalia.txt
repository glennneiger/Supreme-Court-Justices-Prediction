perhaps
so,
but
why
is
it
so
that
you
would
be
without
liability
for
breaking
those
contracts
any
more
than
you
would
be
without
liability
for
breaking
other
contracts?
you
certainly
don't
say
that
money
that
the
bank
owes
to
some
people
is
no
longer
owed
because
the
bank
is
now
out
of
existence,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
just
a
contract
like
that,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
was
a
contract
to
provide
desks,
not
just
in
the
past,
but
in
the
future,
wouldn't
you
be
liable
for
the
profit
that
is
lost--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
terminating
that
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
without
liability?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
but,
i
mean,
you
can
say
repudiate...
any
businessman
can
repudiate
a
contract,
but
the
issue
is
whether
you're
liable
for
the
money
under
it.
to
say
you
can
repudiate
it
doesn't
establish
that
you're
not
liable
for
the
breach.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
an
essential
part
of
your
case,
and
you
don't
really
argue
here
that
when
there
is
a
repudiation
there
is
necessarily
no
liability
for
the
breach
of
future--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
have
to
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
ordinarily
federal
agencies
have
to
do
that?
i
mean,
let's
assume
a
regular
federal
agency
wants
to
terminate
a
contract.
does
it
have
to
give
a
due
process
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
intuitive,
we
know
that
intuitively
it
means
sue-and-be-sued
commercially?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
argument
went
beyond
that.
i
thought
you
were
also
arguing
that
even
without
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
even
without
the
sue-and-be-sued
argument,
there
simply
is
no
such
thing
as
a
bivens
action
that
is
against
the
government
and
not
against
a
private
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
make
that
argument
below
as
well,
or
is
that
being
made
for
the
first
time
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
statement
was
true
pre-bivens.
it
was
quite
true
pre-bivens,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
pre-bivens,
and
given
the
new
enactment
of
the
tort
claims
act,
that
statement
in
the
legislative
history
would
be
quite
true,
but
it
says
nothing
about
what
the
effect
of
that
act
would
be
after
you
have
bivens.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
make
clear
that
it
wanted,
even
if
you
read
the
legislative
history.
they
just
made
clear
that
they
thought
that
was
the
effect
of
what
they
were
doing.
i
mean,
had
they
said,
the
object
of
this
legislation
is...
it
didn't
say
that.
it
just
said,
it
will
do
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
that's
true
for
all
government
contracts.
the
federal
government,
unlike
the
private
businessman,
just
can't
come
to
the
conclusion
on
its
own
that
this
contract
is
no
longer
worth
it?
it
has
to
give
some
rudimentary
notice
and
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
all
people
that
have
contracts?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're...
then
you're
not
claiming
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
but
just
of
the
regulation.
you're
saying
the
constitution
doesn't
require
such
a
hearing,
but
you
only
have
the
right
to
the
hearing
by
reason
of
the
regulation,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
property,
not
for
what
procedure
is
due.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
filice,
1346(b)
provides
liability
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
suppose
you
have
a
state
that
allows
no
recovery
for
psychological
torts.
it
must
be
physical
injury.
does
that
mean
that
psychological
torts
are
not
cognizable
under
1346(b),
and
therefore
the
government
is
liable
for
all
cognizable
torts?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
it
seems
to
me
you're
repudiating
that
jurisprudence.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
why
you're
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
difference
between
you
and
the
government
is
that
the
government
says
cognizable
means
all
torts,
and
you
say
that
cognizable
means
just
common
law
torts.
is
that
what
we're
arguing
about,
essentially?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
little
choice
in
rotten
eggs,
it
seems
to
me.
why
shouldn't
we
take
the
government's
unrealistic
interpretation
rather
than
your
unrealistic--
[laughter]
it
seems
to
me
it
means
neither
one
of
those
things.
