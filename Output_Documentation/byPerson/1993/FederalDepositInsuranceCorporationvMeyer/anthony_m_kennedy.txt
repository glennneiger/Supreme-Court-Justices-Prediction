justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
this
california
law
agree
with
that?
in
other
words,
if
there
is
a
receivership
of
a
business
in
california
law,
there's
an
absolute
right
to
terminate
all
the
employees
and
hire
all
the
new
ones?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
your
theory
is,
is
that
the
company
has
gone
out
of
business,
and
i
just
have
some
trouble
with
that.
most
receiverships,
including
the
fdic,
operate
the
business
on
a
routine
basis
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
fdic.
could
they
fire
all
the
janitors
because
they
didn't
like
the
way
they
parted
their
hair?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
we
reach
that
result
without
even
referring
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
just
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--sue-and-be-sued
clause
alone.
is
that
some
implied
exemption--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
read
into
the
language?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
might
not
have
to
reach
that,
but
we
have
to
understand
it,
i
think,
to
follow
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
a
false
imprisonment
claim,
would
that
be
under
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause,
or
is
that
outside
of
the
commercial
realm?
i
mean,
this
is
a
very
difficult
jurisprudence
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
you
define
cognizable
to
reach
this
conclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
word
"cognizable"
doesn't
mean
tort
claim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
we
said
that
it's
cognizable,
that
that
instance--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
you
gave
is
cognizable?
is
it
your
position
that
this
is
the
respondent's
concession?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
everybody
agrees
that
this
is
cognizable.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
issue
in
the
case,
and
i
don't
think
respondent
agrees
with--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
question
is,
does
everybody
agree
that
that's
what
cognizable
means?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
you
have
to
rely
on--
--may
i
just
make
one...
ask
one
point.
if
we
agree
with
the
government
that
this
claim
must
be
brought
under
1346(b)
or
not
at
all,
and
if
we
say
there's
no
bivens
action
against
a
federal
agency,
is
that
the
end
of
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
except
to
the
extent
that
it's
waived
under
1346(b).
