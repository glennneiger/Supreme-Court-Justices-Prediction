mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
counsel
suggests
that
there's
a
rule
somewhere
that
the
fslic
will
terminate
all
top-level
management
when
a
savings
and
loan
is
seized.
it's
interesting
that
counsel
suggests
that.
that
rule
is
written
in
no
regulation,
no
policy
manual,
no
document
anywhere.
that
was
the
excuse
that
was
given
when
we
filed
this
lawsuit
and
when
we
went
to
the
person
who
actually
made
the
decision
with
respect
to
mr.
meyer
and
told
us
that's
why
that
decision
was
made,
because
he
was
a
top-level
manager.
it
turns
out
that
there
were
a
number
of
top-level
managers
at
fidelity
savings
that
were
not
terminated.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
yes,
that
regulation
exists,
and
the
thrust
of
our
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
mr.
meyer
was
entitled
to
due
process
in
the
decision-making
process
that
led
to
a
determination
that
his
contract
was
burdensome.
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasion
that
where
an
administrative
rule
permits
the
deprivation
of
a
liberty
or
property
interest
the
impacted
individual
has
a
right
to
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
not
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
due
process
required
was
not
elaborate.
we
believe
he
was
entitled
to
notice
and
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
give
reasons,
in
writing
or
in
person,
as
to
why
he
should
not
have
been
terminated.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
not
necessarily
so,
justice
scalia.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
meyer
had
a
property
interest,
and
i
will
describe
where
his
property
interest
came
from,
and
the
regulation
in
question
said
not
that
immediately
upon
the
seizure
that
mr.
meyer's
contract
interest
ceased
to
exist,
but
rather
his
contract
ceased
to
exist
when
and
if
it
was
found
to
be
burdensome.
counsel
has
suggested
that
the
regulation
now
is
that
all
employees
are
terminated
at
the
time
of
seizure.
under
that
regulation,
perhaps
mr.
meyer
wouldn't
have
a
claim,
but
under
the
regulation
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
seizure,
there
had
to
be
a
determination
that
his
contract
was
burdensome.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
no.
we
are
saying
that
under
board
of
regents
v.
roth,
we
look
not
to
the
constitution
to
define
mr.
meyer's
property
interest,
instead,
we
look
to
independent
sources
such
as
state
law.
state
law
in
this
circumstance,
under
california
law,
mr.
meyer
had
an
implied
employment
contract
that
he
would
not
be
terminated
absent
just
cause
for
dismissal,
and
that
implied
employment
contract
was
consistent
with,
in
effect
was
ratified
and
permitted
by
federal
regulations
at
the
time,
which
were
also
different
at
that
time.
at
that
time,
the
federal
regulation
provided
that
employees
of
savings
and
loans
could
have
contracts
and
they
would
not
be
deemed
to
be
an
unsafe
or
unsound
practice
so
long
as
they
had
an
adequate,
appropriate
termination
for
cause
provision,
so
the
federal
regulation
contemplated
that
there
could
be
employment
contracts
with
employees
of
savings
and
loans
that
had
exactly
what
the
california
implied
contract
had--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--i
don't
believe
that
is
strange,
your
honor,
because
if
you
look
at
roth,
which
is
the
touchstone
of
the
property
interest
we're
talking
about,
it
talks
about
reasonable
expectations
of
the
employee,
and
if
you
go
to
a
savings
and
loan
today
and
get
a
job,
you
know,
under
regulations
as
i
understand
them,
that
your
job
is
forever
subject
to
being
terminated
immediately
upon
a
seizure,
but
at
that
time,
federal
regulations
provided
that
you
could
have
an
employment
contract
with
your
employer,
and
it
was
not
prohibited
so
long
as
there
was
an
adequate
termination
for
cause
provision.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
i
believe
that
really
is
a
legal
fiction,
but
what
you
look
to
under
roth
v.
board
of
regents
to
define
the
property
interest
that
mr.
meyer
is
asserting
is
independent
sources
such
as
state
law
which
define...
which
first
of
all
create
the
property
right,
and
at
the
same
time
define
its
scope,
and
california
law
defined
the
scope
of
this
property
interest
as
a
right
to
continued
employment
absent
just
cause
for
dismissal,
and
that
definition
was
completely
consistent
with
federal
law
on
point.
so
our
argument
is
that
mr.
meyer
had
a
property
interest
defined
by
california
law,
and
also
that
that
property
interest
did
not
cease
to
exist
at
the
moment
of
regulatory
seizure--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--as
apparently
it
would
now,
justice
souter.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
no.
i
believe
that
once
you
have
defined
the
property
interest,
as
you
do
by
looking
at
state
law,
then
you
look
at
the
u.s.
constitution
and
the
rulings
of
this
court
to
see
what
you
are
entitled
to.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
a
relevant
question,
because
that's
not...
not--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--i'm
sorry,
chief
justice.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
question
is
critical
to
our
analysis
of
the
case.
[laughter]
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
because
the
definition
of
mr.
meyer's
property
right
was
that
he
was
entitled
to
continued
employment
absent
just
cause
for
dismissal,
and
so
when...
when
the
savings
and
loan
was
taken
over,
at
that
point
in
time
he
had
an
interest
in
continued
employment
the
same
as
if
he
had
had
a
written
contract
that
said
that
he
wouldn't
be
discharged
except
for
just
cause.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
the
constitutional
right,
justice
scalia,
comes
from
the
fifth
amendment,
and
when
we
are
looking
at
property
interests
in
employment,
there's
no
question
the
court
has
said
this
on
numerous
occasions,
that
you
look
to
independent
sources
such
as
state
law,
so
this
is
an
employment
case--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
and
then
the
procedure
that
is
due,
you
look
to
the
fifth
amendment,
and
you
look
to
this
court's
rulings
in
a
number
of
cases,
the
most
recent
one
being
burns
v.
united
states,
that
says
where
an
administrative
regulation
permits
the
government
to
take
property,
or
to...
i'm
sorry,
it
shouldn't
be
a
taking...
to
deprive
somebody
of
a
liberty
or
property
interest,
that
person
should
be
entitled
to
due
process,
and
if
the--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--i
believe
that
we
need
to
have
a
federal
regulation
which
permits
california
to
imply
that
contract
right.
i
believe
that
if
the
federal
regulation
said,
as
it
apparently
does
today,
that
employees
of
savings
and
loans
can
never
have
any
contract
except
for
at-will
employment,
then
i
don't
believe
that
california,
under
the
supremacy
clause,
could
say
no,
we're
going
to
allow
these
contracts
to
be
other
than
at-will.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
well,
first
of
all,
the
qualified
immunity
defense
was
not
submitted,
not
pled,
not
raised
as
a
defense
by
fslic.
secondly,
however,
i
would
say
that
insofar
as
sue-and-be-sued
agencies
are
concerned,
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
should
not
be
applied
because
the
rationale
of
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
is
to
protect
federal
employees
from
personal
liability
so
that
they
will
zealously
complete
their
tasks.
where
you're
talking
about
an
agency,
and
where
you
are
saying
an
agency
should
have
appropriate
constitutional
safeguards
and
what
it
does,
you
don't
have
the
same
concerns
that
are
raised
by
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine,
and
indeed,
you
have
the
converse.
you,
i
think,
would
like
to
encourage
federal
agencies
to
comply
with
constitutional--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--well,
congress--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--well,
i
would
say
that
there
is
some
sense
in
this
sense:
this
agency
was
an
independent
corporation
that
had
both
government
and
nongovernmental
funds,
that
operated
with
its
own
board
of
directors,
that
had
its
own
budget,
that
was
authorized
to
commit
corporate
funds
for
various
expenses,
so
this
agency
in
fact
is
different
than
a
standard
agency
that
is
not
an
independent,
sue-and-be-sued
corporate
agency.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
this
agency
and
other
governmental
agencies.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
you
have
not,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
you
have
been
asked
to
do
that,
so
far
as
i
can
tell.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
yes,
we
are,
and
the
reason
why
we
are,
other...
if
i
can
move
on
to
the
sue-and-be-sued
argument
that
we've
gotten--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--yes.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
said
that
that
way...
and
let
me
just
make
clear
what
our
position
is.
we
do
not
doubt
the
broad
discretion
of
the
fslic
during
a
regulatory
takeover
to
terminate
those
contracts...
leases,
employment
contracts,
whatever...
that
it
considers
burdensome.
we
believe,
however,
that
mr.
meyer,
having
a
constitutionally
protected
property
interest
as
defined
by
state
law,
was
entitled
to
notice
and
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
person
or
in
writing
why
that
action
should
not
be
taken.
i
don't
know
that
i
have
made
a...
that
i
have
a
position
on
who
should
bear
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
regard.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
i
would
say,
however,
that
we
do
not
gainsay
the
government's
right,
broad
right
to
act
boldly
when
there's
an
fslic
takeover
of
a
savings
and
loan
that
has
financial
problems.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--that's
correct,
and
apparently,
the
way
the
government
now
operates,
probably
nobody
could
make
this
claim,
because
the
way
the
government
now
operates,
apparently
you
can
only
have
an
at-will
employment
contract
with
a
savings
and
loan.
to
move
on
to
the
sue-and-be-sued
language,
we
believe
that
the
government's
argument
is
a
circular
argument
with
respect
to
the
sue-and-be-sued
language.
the
government
identifies
the
appropriate
statutes,
and
the
issue
boils
down
to
whether
this
action
is
cognizable
not
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
as
mr.
bender
said...
2679(a)
says
the
issue
is
whether
it
is
cognizable
under
1346(b),
and
1346(b)
does
not
say
torts,
as
the
government
would
wish
it
says.
1346(b)
says
that
actions
cognizable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
actions
are
those
actions
for
which
a
private
individual
would
be
liable
under
local
law.
i
don't
believe
we
need
to
go
beyond
the
wording
of
the
statute
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
to
interpret
that
plain
language.
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause
and
the
federal
tort
claims
act
draw
the
same
distinction
that
we
wish
to
draw.
that
is,
common
law
torts
are
covered
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
those
actions
that
are
other
than
common
law
torts
are
not
cognizable,
and
if
there
is
an
appropriate
sue-and-be-sued
clause,
that
gives
jurisdiction
against
a
sue-and-be-sued
agency.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
in
other
words,
if
you
say
that
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause
does
not
waive
sovereign
immunity?
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
i
believe
that
probably
would
be
the
end
of
our
case.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief
we
make
the
point
that
a
number
of
judicial
riders
have
commented
that
sovereign
immunity
as
a
doctrine
should
not
really
be
applied
in
cases
of
constitutional
torts.
sovereign
immunity
does
not
retain
its
medieval
connotation
that
the
sovereign
cannot
be
sued
merely
because
the
king
can
do
no
wrong.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
in
fact
this
case
is
very
different
than
the
majority
of
bivens
cases,
in
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
an
indirect
impact
on
the
federal
fisc.
bivens
defendants
are
routinely
provided
indemnity
by
their
federal
employers.
that
is
an
indirect
impact
on
the
federal
fisc.
this
would
also
be
an
indirect
impact
in
that
fsli...
this
would
not
be
a
judgment
against
the
united
states.
this
would
be
a
judgment
against
the
fslic,
an
independent
corporation,
having
its
own
budget,
having
sources
of
funds
that
are
both
private
and
public,
so
i
believe
that
both
the
standard
bivens
action
against
an
individual
and
a
bivens
action
against
a
sue-and-be-sued
agency
would
in
fact
only
have
an
indirect
impact
on
the
federal
treasury.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
well--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--well,
it
is
voluntarily
assumed
only
with
a
gun
at
its
head,
so
to
speak.
in
other
words--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--well,
the
gun
comes
from
the
practical
consideration
that
if
the
federal
government,
after
the
creation
of
bivens,
then
had
a
policy
that
it
was
not
going
to
indemnify
or
provide
a
defense,
which
is
another
expense
to
any
of
its
employees
that
were
charged
with
bivens
actions,
that
would
cause
a
tremendous
morale
problem
among
federal
employees
and
would
be,
in
a
practical
sense,
an
impossible
situation,
so
in
fact--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--well,
it's
voluntary
in
a
sense,
but
it
would
cause
timidity,
or
lack
of
zealousness
in
government
employees,
or
lack
of
morale,
and
so
in
a
sense,
when
the
court
came
down
with
the
bivens
decision,
it
wasn't
directly
impacting
the
federal
fisc,
but
in
a
practical
sense
it
was
indirectly
impacting
the
federal
fisc,
because
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
the
government
would
ever
take
the
position
that
it
is
never
going
to
provide
a
defense,
let
alone
indemnity,
on
every
bivens
claim
no
matter
how
specious
the
claim
is.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
your
decision
in
smith
dealt
with
the
1988
legislation,
the
1988
federal
employees
reform
act,
which
was
in
turn
a
response
to
your
westfall
decision.
your
westfall
decision
dealt
with
federal
employee
liability,
and
it
dealt
with
liability
for
common
law
torts.
that
was
the
problem
that
congress
was
looking
at
when
it
passed
that
1988
legislation.
it
was
looking
at
a
situation
involving
federal
employees
and
common
law
torts.
congress
made
no
attempt
in
the
1988
legislation,
which
you
then
construed
in
smith,
to
look
one
way
at
the
other
at
sue-and-be-sued
clauses,
let
alone
federal
agencies,
and
indeed,
if
we
look
at
what
congress
did,
i
believe
it
is
more
consistent
with
our
position,
namely
what
congress
did
in
the
1988
legislation
was,
they
drew
a
distinction
between
common
law
torts
and
constitutional
torts
and
said
common
law
torts
are
cognizable
under
the
federal
torts
claims
act
and
constitutional
torts
are
not.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
well,
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
it
is
difficult
to
interpret
the
sounds
of
legislative
silence.
in
the
1988
legislation,
and
what
the
government
is
talking
about
and
seeking
to
draw
conclusions
from,
the
government...
the
congress
did
not
in
fact
pass
a
completely
symmetrical
statute.
in
other
words,
they
dealt
with
employees,
but
they
didn't
deal
with
agencies.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
except
that
your
definition,
your
honor,
respectfully,
in
the
smith
case
again
dealt
with
common
law
torts
and
with
employees,
and
what
you
said
in
smith
was,
excluded
common
law
torts,
implicitly
or
explicitly,
excluded
common
law
torts,
would
arguably
still
be
cognizable
under
the
act.
but
that
is
a
different
question
than
whether
constitutional
torts
are
cognizable,
and
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
1346(b)
to
determine
the
answer
to
that
question,
and
the
last
sentence,
or
last
phrase
of
1346(b)
makes
very
clear
what
congress'
intent
was.
congress'
intent
was
to
recognize,
to
take
cognizance
of
those
wrongs
for
which
a
private
individual
would
be
liable
under
local
law.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
that's
true,
but--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--that's
true,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause
was...
that
we're
talking
about
for
the
fslic
was
drafted
in
the
1930's,
but
the
point
we
are
making
is,
is
this
court
has
held
that
sue-and-be-sued
clauses
are
to
be
liberally
construed
as
general
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
unless
one
of
three
things
occur,
unless
the
suit
in
question
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
scheme,
unless
an
implied
restriction
on
the
general
waiver
is
necessary
to
avoid
a
grave
interference
with
a
governmental...
performance
of
a
governmental
function,
or
unless
it
was
clearly
the
purpose
of
congress
to
use
a
sue-and-be-sued
clause
in
a
narrow
sense.
none
of
those
three
conditions
exist
here,
so
in
the
1930's
when
congress
created
the
fslic
and
decided
how
broadly
it
would
waive
immunity
for
the
fslic,
at
that
point
in
time,
what
congress
decided
to
do
was,
rather
than
delineate
all
of
the
ways--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--that's
true.
what
congress
intended
to
do,
your
honor,
was
to
waive
immunity
generally
for
that
agency,
subject
to
those
exceptions
that
may
later
occur.
now,
the
government
has
identified
that
later
came
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
possibly
the
federal
tort
claims
act
could
have
been
written
to
exclude
this
kind
of
an
action.
it
was
not.
congress
could
today...
congress
could
today
take
a
look
at
the
issue,
and
could
say,
we're
also
going
to
include
constitutional
torts
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
with
these
rules,
but
when
congress
decided
to
launch
this
agency,
congress
used
a
broad
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
which
waives
all
immunity
for
the
universe,
subject
to
such
exceptions
as
may
be
made
later
on.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
well,
there
is
jurisprudence
by
this
court
that
would
say
no,
that
that
is
cognizable.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
no.
no,
the
way
i
just--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--the
way
i
justify
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
those
actions
are
at
least
common
law
torts.
i
think
the
court
could
look
at
those
actions
and
could
say
it
was
clearly
the
purpose
of
congress
to
include
within
the
federal
tort
claims
act
those
actions
that
are
common
law
torts.
that's
the
meaning
of
that
last
phrase,
so
that
if
there
is
a
common
law
tort
that
is
not...
that
is
accepted
either
implicitly
or
plicitly
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
then
that
still
would
be
cognizable,
but
here
we're
talking
about
constitutional
torts.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
i
believe
that
is
one
way
to
put
it,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
well,
we
believe
that
our...
well,
i
would
say
this
about
your
hypothetical,
your
hypothetical,
while
certainly
i
am
duty
bound
to
answer
it,
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
today.
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
yes--
mr.
gennaro
a.
filice
iii
--yes,
i
am,
and
it's
my
position
that
the
logic
of
the
bivens
action,
namely,
that
this
court
has
the
primary
duty
to
enforce
constitutionally
protected
rights,
and
that
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
article
iii
courts,
in
protecting
constitutionally
protected
rights
would
turn
to
traditional
judicial
remedies
like
damages
to
do
that,
applies
with
equal
logic
to
a
sue-and-be-sued
agency,
and
that
sue-and-be-sued
agency
has
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
by
congress,
so
i
believe
that...
i
believe
that
your
logic
in
bivens
makes
perfect
sense
for
a
sue-and-be-sued
agency,
and
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
but
to
get
back
to
what
i
was
saying
to
justice
scalia,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was,
perhaps
my
answer
to
the
hypothetical
was
nonsensical,
but
my
answer
to
the
government's
position
in
this
case
makes
sense.
no
matter
how
you
read
the
language
of
that
statute,
1346(b),
you
can't
squeeze
in
a
constitutional
claim.
that
language
says
that
it
is
concerned
with
wrongs
for
which
a
private
individual
would
be
liable
under
local
law,
and
that
cannot
include
a
constitutional
tort.
