well,
how
could
it
be
cognizable
if
the
court
doesn't
even
have
jurisdiction
under
the
statute?

well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
bender,
i
mean,
if
you
just
read
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
i
think
you
have
a
hard
time
reaching
your
interpretation
of
what
cognizable
means.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
this
court's
determination?
