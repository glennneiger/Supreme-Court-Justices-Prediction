mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
the
financial
failure
of
a
large
california
savings
and
loan
institution
in
the
early
1980's.
the
bank
had
been
suffering
very
serious
financial
losses.
it's
net
worth
had
gone
down
from
about
$100
million
to
about
$15
million
in
the
several
months
preceding
the
seizure
of
the
bank.
in
the
week
preceding
the
seizure,
depositors
removed
about
$70
million
from
the
bank's
deposits.
the
bank
was
seized
by
the
california
savings
and
loan
commissioner
because
she
thought
the
bank
was
operating
in
an
unsafe
manner.
she
appointed
the
f-s-l-i-c...
fslic,
which
has
since
been
replaced
by
fdic...
as
the
receiver,
and
fslic
was
also
appointed
receiver
under
federal
law.
under
fslic's
policy
then,
which
is
still
fdic's
policy,
when
a
thrift
institution
fails
for
financial
reasons,
they
immediately
terminate
all
the
top
management
of
the
bank,
for
obvious
reasons.
that's
the
management
that
got
the
bank
into
the
financial
condition
that
required
the
seizure,
those
are
the
highest
paid
people,
but
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
receiver's
job
is
either
to
terminate
the
bank,
or
to
merge
it
with
another
going
institution,
and
for
the
purposes
of
doing
that,
it's
very
important
not
to
have
the
top
management
there,
because
the
institution
into
which
it's
merged
will
have
its
own
management.
pursuant
to
that
policy,
the
four
top
officers
of
fidelity
were
terminated...
the
president,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
mr.
meyer,
who
is
the
president's
brother,
and
two
other
people.
the
bank
was...
what
happens
is,
the
bank
is
terminated...
the
receiver
takes
over
at
the
end
of
one
day,
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
day
the
bank
reopens
as
a
new
institution
which
is
chartered
by
the
federal
home
bank
board.
six
months
later,
that
new
institution
merged
the
bank
into
citibank,
i
think,
in
california,
and
it
continues
to
exist
in
that
form.
mr.
paul
bender
he
was
the
head
of
the
branch
operations.
i
think
he
was
called
a
service
manager,
but
his
primary
responsibility,
i
think,
was
to
be
in
charge
of
branch
operations.
he
brought
a
lawsuit
based
on
many
different
claimed
rights.
the
only
ones
which
proceeded
to
trial
were
claims
not
of
a
breach
of
contract
but
claims
under
the
due
process
clause.
the
lawsuit
was
based
on
an
alleged
implied
contract
of
continued
employment
which
he
said
that
california
law
gave
him
as
a
long-term
employee
of
the
bank,
but
he
didn't...
the
suit
that
got
to
trial
before
the
jury
was
not
a
suit
based
on
the
breach
of
contract,
it
was
a
suit
based
on
the
alleged
deprivation
of
his
contract
rights
without
due
process.
he
says--
mr.
paul
bender
--if
the
bank
had
continued
to
operate
and
he
had
been
fired,
yes,
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
he
would
have--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
i
don't
think
it
was
a
right
to
process,
it
was
a
contract
right.
if
the
bank
had
continued--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
i
think
the
contract
claim
would
have
just
been
for
breach
of
his
contract
of
employment.
he
makes
no
suggestion,
and
i
know
nothing
in
california
contract
law,
that
would
suggest
he
had
any
procedural
rights.
his
remedy
under
california
contract
law
would
have
been
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract
against
the
bank
for
terminating
him
without
just
cause.
that's
not
the
suit
that
he
brought
here.
the
suit
that
he
has
recovered
on,
a
jury...
the
two
suits
that
went
to
the
jury
were
a
claim
against
fdic
for
the
deprivation
of
his
property
without
due
process,
and
a
claim
against
the
receiver
for
deprivation
of
his
property,
his
contract
right,
without
due
process.
the
jury
found
for
the
receiver
on
the
ground
that
he
had
qualified
immunity,
but
the
jury
found
for
the
plaintiff
against
fdic
in
the
amount
of
$130,000.
mr.
paul
bender
he
brought
state
law
tort
claims,
but
they
didn't
proceed
to
trial.
they
were
dismissed
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
he
has
a
tort
remedy
under
state
law.
the
particular
tort
remedy--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
if
he
had
a
tort
remedy
under
state
law,
he
could
try
to
assert
that
state
law
remedy
against
the
federal
government
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
that's
not
the
right
he
alleges
in
this
case.
here
he's
alleging
a
violation
of
his
federal
constitutional
rights.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
yes,
it
would.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right.
this
case
should
have
been
dismissed
before
trial,
because
there
was
no
deprivation
of
property,
nor...
even
if
there
was
a
deprivation
of
property,
it
wasn't
without
due
process,
and...
well,
let
me
turn
to
that
first,
because
i
think
that's
really
the
most
fundamental
question
in
this
case.
there
was
no
deprivation
of
property
because
the
only
property
right
he
asserts,
the
right
to
continued
employment,
ended
by
virtue
of
the
failure
of
the
bank
and
its
seizure
by
the
receiver.
when
the
bank
fails
and
it's
seized
by
the
receiver,
it's
just
as
if
the
bank
had
itself
gone
out
of
business,
because--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes.
i
think
it's
a
little
easier
to
understand
the
case
if
you
understand
first
what
the
tort
right
is,
what
the
constitutional
tort
right
is
that
he's
asserting.
mr.
paul
bender
absolutely.
both
points
are
important,
and
both
points
are
raised
by
the
case.
either
one
is
sufficient
to
dispose
of
the
case.
if
he
worked
for
the
bank
with
a
contract
of...
an
implied
contract
of
continued
employment
and
the
bank
went
out
of
business
for
financial
reasons,
i
don't
think
anyone
would
think
that
he
had
a
right
of
continued
employment
with
a
bank
which
had
failed
and
was
no
longer
in
business,
and
that's
exactly
what
happens
when
a
bank
goes
into
receivership.
you
can
tell
that
by
the
notion...
the
common
law
notion
of
receivership,
which
has
been
absorbed
into
the
federal
statutes,
cases
going
way
back,
including
decisions
of
this
court,
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--we
think
so,
but
that's
irrelevant,
because
federal
law
clearly
supersedes
california
law,
and
the
receiver
here
was
appointed
under
federal
law.
remember,
this
is
a
bank
insured
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
paul
bender
in
fact,
fdic
now
has
a
policy
of
firing
all
employees
immediately
upon
the
onset
of
a
receivership
and
hiring
back
those
that
it
wants
to
hire
back
to
do
whatever
the
bank
wants
to
do.
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
assume
that
the
bank
always
continues
operating
in
exactly
the
same
form.
the
receiver
has
the
right
to
terminate,
wind
up
the
affairs
of
the
bank,
he
has
the
right
to
consolidate
or
merge
it
with
another
bank,
he
has
a
right
to
draw
it
in,
draw
in
its
scope
of
operations
to
make
it
profitable,
new
management
takes
over,
the
receiver
feels
it
needs
new
management
in
order
to
accomplish
those
things,
and
to
have
the
old
top
management
staying
on
in
the
bank
as
you're
trying
to
merge
it
with
another
bank,
which
they
may
have
resisted
doing
for
a
number
of
years,
as
you're
trying
to
wind
up
its
affairs,
would
be
really
disruptive.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
no,
i...
that's
a
really
good
point.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
not.
there...
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
between
two
different
kinds
of
contracts.
for
example,
this
employee
had
accrued
vacation
pay
coming
to
him,
or
perhaps
even
accrued
severance
pay.
that
he
would
be
entitled
to,
because
that
is
pay
for
past
services,
and
similarly,
a
company
that
had
supplied
desks,
let's
say,
to
the
bank,
which
already
had
them,
and
they
hadn't
paid
the
bill
yet,
that
company
would
be
entitled
to
recover
that
out
of
the
assets
of
the
bank.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
quite
clear--
mr.
paul
bender
--it's
quite
clear
that
the
receiver
has
the
power
to
terminate
those
kinds
of
executory
contracts
which
haven't
yet
taken
place.
at
that
time
the
regulations
said
that
the
receiver
had
the
power
to
reject
or
repudiate
any
lease
or
contract
which
it
considers
burdensome.
mr.
paul
bender
without
liability
for
future
profits,
without
liability
for
services
that
had
not
been
rendered.
it
can
repudiate
contracts
for
past
services
where
the
money
had
already
be
earned,
and
then
there
would
be
liability.
it
would
be
contract
liability,
and
it
would
be
contract
liability
that
would
come
out
of
the
remaining
assets
of
that
bank,
not
liability
that
would
be
paid
by
the
assets
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right,
and
so
the
main
burden
of
the
repudiation
clause,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
be
towards
these
future
contracts.
if
you
were
going
to
let
him
recover
on
that
contract,
how
much
could
he
recover?
mr.
paul
bender
right,
but
maybe
the
most
fundamental
point
is,
if
you're
liable,
you're
liable
only
on
contract
out
of
the
assets
of
the
bank.
that's
not
the
claim
that
mr.
meyer
has
brought
here.
even
if
he
did
have
a
contract
right,
it
would
be
a
right
that
was
enforceable
only
by
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract,
and
that
suit
would
be
payable
only
out
of
the
remaining
net
assets
of
the
bank,
so
that
if
the
bank
in
fact
had
no
net
assets,
he
wouldn't
get
any
money.
what
he
has
tried
to
do
here
is
to
turn
that
contract
suit
out
of
no...
which
would
have
to
be
paid
out
of
no
assets,
into
a
suit
where
he
wants
to
be
paid
from
the
taxpayer's
money
through
the
federal
appropriations
to
the
fdic,
or
fslic,
by
saying
that
i'm
not
suing
under
contract,
i'm
suing
for
the
breach
of
the
contract
without
due
process,
as
if
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing
before
that.
mr.
paul
bender
not
at
all,
although
we
do
feel
that
there
is
no
liability
for
the
future
work
he
was
going
to
do,
that
the
contract
terminates.
if
you
want
to...
you
could
look
at
it
this
way.
when
that
contract--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
you
don't
have
to
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
no,
we're
not
arguing
that
at
all.
we're
arguing
that
the
government
here
did
not
deprive
him
of
his
property
without
due
process,
first
because
we
don't
think
he
had
any
property,
but
if,
as
justice
scalia
believes,
you
think
he
was
deprived
of
property,
that
was
still
not
without
due
process,
because
he
has
a
completely
adequate
remedy,
the
normal
remedy,
the
remedy
he
would
have
had
if
the
bank
had
terminated
him
itself,
namely,
to
sue
the
bank
under
california
law
of
contract,
which
he
is
able
to
do.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
because
the
receivership
doesn't...
although
the
receivership
has
the
power,
federal
law
has
the
power
to
totally
supersede
state
law,
it
hasn't
done
that,
and
it's
clear
that
the
receivership
permits
suits
to
be
brought
against
the
remaining
assets
of
the
bank
for
contracts
on
which
the
money
had
already
been
earned,
such
as
contracts
for
past
services.
if
federal
law
tried
to
wipe
out
those
contracts
as
well,
i
think
there
would
be
a
problem
with
the
takings
clause.
in
any
event,
the
receiver
has
never...
has
never...
as
far
as
i
know
has
never
alleged
that
that
happened.
mr.
paul
bender
exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
exactly,
right.
that's
all
the
process
he
would
have
had
due
if
the
bank
had
gone
out
of
business
itself,
or
if
the
bank
had
fired
him,
and
there's
absolutely
no
reason
why
he
should
suddenly
get
an
entry
into
the
federal
treasury
because
the
bank
goes
into
receivership.
his
rights...
kind
of
ironic
that
management
that
would
run
a
bank
and
run
it
into
the
ground
so
that
the
depositors
lose
all
their
money
except
for
the
federal
insurance
should
then
be
able
to
have
a
key
into
the
federal
treasury
to
recover
on
contracts
that
they
couldn't
recover
on
against
the
banks.
mr.
paul
bender
he
can
argue
that,
and
he
does,
but
that
is
not
a...
that
is
not
a
convincing
argument,
because
the
federal
law
made
clear
at
the
time,
then
in
the
regulations,
now
in
the
statute,
that
the
receiver
can
repudiate
any
contract
which
it
considers
burdensome.
i
think
you
can't
read
language
like
that
to
say
that
that's
something
you
have
a
hearing
over
and
an
adjudication
over.
it's
any...
it
can
repudiate
a
contract
that
the
receiver
considers
burdensome.
it's
in
the
sole
discretion
of
the
receiver,
and
it
has
to
be.
if
you
seize
a
bank
with
20
or
30
top
management
people
and
you
have
to
give
them
all
hearings
before
you
can
terminate
their
services
and
move
on
with
the
business
of
reorganizing
the
bank,
that's
going
to
make
receiverships
much
less
efficient.
the
whole
purpose
of
these
receiverships
is
to
go
into
a
failing
institution
and
save
what's
still
there
for
the
depositors
and
for
the
federal
taxpayers.
to
have
to
go
through
a
bunch
of
hearings
and
then,
once
you
have
the
initial
hearing
there
will
probably
be
an
asserted
right
to
some
kind
of
review
of
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
burdensome
contract,
those
are
not
questions
that
the
receiver
is
easily
going
to
be
able
to
answer
in
a
short
period
of
time
before
an
independent
hearing
examiner.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
right
to
recover
damages
for
the
breach
of
contract
is
the
process
that
is
due
in
the
commercial
world.
you're
dealing
here
with
the
fdic
and
fslic...
and
let
me
move
now
to
the
second
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
paul
bender
you're
talking
about
a
federal
agency?
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that
if
the
statute
makes
it
clear
that
it's
in
his
sole
discretion,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
right
to
a
hearing.
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
found
there
were
rights
to
hearings
are
cases
where
the
statute
says,
you
can
be
fired,
but
only
for
cause.
i
don't
think
we
have
cases
in
which
the
state
law
which
creates
these
property
rights
made
it
clear
that
it
was
in
the
sole
discretion
of
the
person.
it's
like
a
contract
at
will.
once
the
bank
goes
into
the
receivership,
the
employment
of
the
people
that
work
for
the
bank
is
employment
at
will.
the
receiver
can
terminate
it
at
any
time,
just
like
a
private
employer
could.
mr.
paul
bender
i'm
about
to,
i
hope.
the
question
here
is
whether,
if
there
were
a
constitutional
right
in
this
case,
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process,
there
would
be
a
suit
against
the
fdic,
the
successor
of
fslic.
the
only
ground
for
urging
that
there
would
be
such
a
suit
is
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause
of
the
agencies.
if
an
official
in
the
department
of
justice
were
to
commit
a
constitutional
violation,
there's
no
suit
against
the
department
of
justice
for
that.
it
has
no
sue-and-be-sued
clause.
there's
no
suit,
it's
clearly
established,
against
the
united
states
for
bivens-type
constitutional
tort
actions.
so
the
only
way
that
the
plaintiff
can
claim
here
that
there's
any
ability
to
recover
against
fdic
for
the
constitutional
tort
is
because
of
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause.
i
think
if
you
just...
even
if
you
just
had
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause,
you
would
have
to
hold
that
that
does
not
authorize
constitutional
torts,
suits
for
constitutional
torts.
the
sue-and-be-sued
clauses
were
to
enable
these
entities
to
engage
in
commerce
in
the
commercial
marketplace,
and
they
were
meant
to
be
able
to
sue
and
be
sued
on
ordinary,
commercial
kinds
of
causes
of
action...
contracts
and
torts
growing
out
of
the
running
of
a
private
business.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
just--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--that's
the...
that
was
the
reason
for
the
creation
of
the
sue-and-be-sued
liability,
but
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
here,
because
congress
clarified
that,
made
that
absolutely
clear.
mr.
paul
bender
right...
no,
you
don't.
you
could...
even
if
you
thought
that
constitutional
torts
could
come
under
the
general
sue-and-be-sued
language,
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
they're...
it
doesn't
intend
that
they
do
by
specific
language
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
i
do
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
sue-and-be-sued
authority
is
not
just
an
open-ended...
i
don't
think
it
was
intended
to
be
an
open-ended
sue-and-be-sued
authority.
it
was
intended
to
facilitate
the
operation
of
these
agencies
in
the
commercial
marketplace,
and
i
don't
think
you
should
infer
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
a
wholly
different
kind
of
thing,
a
tort
action
growing,
implied
by
the
court
out
of
the
constitution
from
that
sue-and-be-sued
authority,
but
congress
made
it
entirely
clear
that
that's
what
it
was
thinking
in
the
enactment
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
so.
if
the
tort
claim
comes
under
state
law,
then
i
think
it
can
be
made
against
the
agency
under
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause,
but
i
don't
think
the
sue-and-be-sued
clauses
were
meant
to
create
liability
in
those
agencies
arising
out
of
the
federal
constitution.
so
in
your
ordinary
false
imprisonment
case
there's
probably
a
state
law
claim,
which
is
the
same
kind
of
a
claim
which
could
be
brought
against
a
private
company.
that's
the
test
i'm
asking
you
to
use.
the
kinds
of
claims
that
could
be
brought
against
a
private
company
were
the
kinds
of
claims
that
were
intended
to
be
authorized
by
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right,
and
that's
because
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
agencies.
the
ones
without
sue-and-be-sued
clauses,
it's
clear
that
they
cannot
be
sued.
you'd
have
to
sue
the
united
states,
and
it's
plain
you
cannot
sue
the
united
states
on
a
bivens-type
tort.
the
other
kinds
of
agencies
are
the
sue-and-be-sued
agencies,
and
there
congress
made
it
clear
in
the
tort
claims
act
that
it
wanted
to
make
the
tort
liability
of
sue-and-be-sued
agencies
exactly
the
same
as
the
tort
liability
of
other
agencies.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right.
there
is--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
believe
we
made
that
argument
below,
yes.
i
don't
think
it's
being
made
for
the
first
time
here.
that
argument
was
certainly
made
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
there
was
no
claim
that
it
had
not
been
made
below.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that.
the
sue-and-be-sued
clauses
were
first.
many
of
them
were
first,
and
by
the
time
of
the
tort
claims
act
in
1946,
there
had
been
a
number
of
tort
suits
brought
against
the
sue-and-be-sued
agencies,
state
law
tort
suits,
because
there
were
no
bivens
claims
at
that
time.
in
enacting
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
congress
said
that
government,
the
federal
government
is
now
going
to
be
liable
on
the
torts
of
all
federal
agencies,
sue-and-be-sued
or
not,
with
certain
important
limitations
and
at
the
same
time
it
said...
in
the
statute
that
is
now
2679(a),
it
said
that
the
sue-and-be-sued
agencies
should
also
not
be
sued,
and
all
tort
claims
should
be
brought
against
the
federal
government,
and
the
legislative
history...
let
me
read
you
a
brief
excerpt
of
the
committee
report
that
accompanied
that
statute.
it
says,
404>
["]...
that's
the
predecessor
of
the
statute
we
now
have...
"provides
that
federal
agencies
suable
in
their
own
name
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
bill
will
no
longer
be
suable
for
torts
cognizable
under
that
bill.
"
"this
will
place
torts
of
suable
agencies
of
the
united
states
on
precisely
the
same
footing
as
torts
of
nonsuable
agencies.
"
i
don't
see
any
way
you
can
read
that
language
except
to
say
that
you
could
no
longer
sue
the
sue-and-be-sued
agencies
for
tort--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
i
think
the
language
in
the
statute
itself
is
just
as
clear,
because
it
refers
to...
it
says
the
authority
of
any
federal
agency
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
its
own
name
shall
not
be
construed
to
authorize
suits
against
such
federal
agency
on
claims
which
are
cognizable
under
the
tort
claims
act,
and
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
when
they
said,
claims
cognizable
under
the
tort
claims
act,
they
meant
all
tort
claims.
mr.
paul
bender
that
was
pre-bivens.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
it
wasn't
true
before
the
tort
claims
act.
before
the
tort
claims
act,
you
could
sue
the
sue-and-be-sued
agencies
under
tort,
and
so
congress
was
clearly
doing
something
important
here.
mr.
paul
bender
all
right,
then
the
question
for
this
court
is,
when
the
court
creates
the
bivens
cause
of
action,
finds
the
bivens
cause
of
action
in
the
constitution,
is
that
now
going
to
be
the
only
tort
claim
that
you
can
bring
against
the
agencies,
even
though
you
can't
bring
it
against
the
united
states?
i
think
bivens--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
i
think
by
cognizable
under
1346(b),
they
meant
tort
claims,
otherwise
they
could
not
possibly
have
said
what
they
say
in
the
next
sentence
of
the
committee
report.
this
will
place
torts
of
suable
agencies
on
precisely
the
same
footing
as
torts
of
nonsuable
agencies.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
right.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right,
but
it's
still
a
tort
claim
cognizable
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
purposes
of--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
define
it
as
a
tort
claim.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
it
says,
cognizable
under
the
tort
claims
act,
which
i
think
means
recognizable
under
the
tort
claims
act.
that's
the
most
natural
meaning
of
the
word,
which
i
think
means
a
tort
claim.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
take,
for
example,
a
case
of
the
post
office's
negligent
delivery
of
mail.
you
cannot
recover
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
that...
there's
a
specific
exception...
and
yet
everyone
agrees
that
that's
cognizable
under
the
tort
claims
act,
even
though
it's
specifically
excluded
because
it's
a
tort
claim,
and
congress
has--
mr.
paul
bender
--right,
but
just...
that's
a
different
reason.
here...
there
they
exclude
it
because
they
don't
want
the
post
office
burdened
with
that
liability.
here
they
exclude
it
because
they
don't
want
the
federal
government
burdened
with
liability
unless
it's
the
kind
of
liability
that
an
entity
would
be
subject
to
under
state
law.
just
because
it's
a
different
reason
for
congress
excluding
it,
it's
still
an
exclusion--
mr.
paul
bender
--and
it's
clear
that
many
things
excluded--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
if
all
you
had
was
the
language
of
the
statute
there
would
be
a
difficulty
in
reading
it
that
way,
but
when
you
start
to
think
about
it
and
realize
that
a
suit
against
the
post
office
for
negligent
delivery
of
mail
cannot
be
successfully
brought
under
the
tort
claims
act,
nevertheless
it
is
held
cognizable.
you
can't
sue...
the
post
office
is
a
sue-and-be-sued
agency.
mr.
paul
bender
what
is--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
i
think
it's
clear
in--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
everybody
agrees
that
you
cannot
sue
the
united
states
postal
service
for
negligent
delivery
of
the
mail.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
this
is
the
first
case
to
raise
that,
to
raise
the
question.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
not
incomplete.
it's
not
as
exact
as
we
would
like
it
to
be.
it's
somewhat
uncertain
what
cognizable
means,
but
i
think
when
you
start
to
think
about
the
consequences
of
holding
that
it
means
that
it's
only
those
cases
that
you
could
succeed
under
the
tort
claims
act
under,
you
will
realize
it
can't
mean...
cognizable
can't
mean
claims
you
can
win
under
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
paul
bender
it
could
mean
claims
that
have
a
counterpart
in
state
law,
that's
true,
but
bivens,
then,
i
think
makes
clear
that
you
shouldn't
assume...
you
shouldn't
imply
a
cause
of
action
against
the
agency.
bivens
itself
said
that
there
are
certain
factors
counseling
hesitation
in
creating
bivens
actions,
and
one
of
them,
the
first
one
justice
brennan
mentioned
there,
was
an
impact
on
the
federal
fisc,
and
you
couldn't
get
clearer
case
of
an
impact
on
the
federal
fisc
than
the
tort
action
in
this
case.
and
so
even
if
you
think
that
it
would
be
possible
to
imply
some
kinds
of
bivens
actions
against
federal
agencies,
although
we
don't
think
you
should,
you
certainly
would
not
imply
one
in
this
kind
of
situation,
where
it
is
a
direct
attack
on
the
federal
treasury,
and
exactly
the
kind
of
action
that
bivens
says
you
should
not--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
it
does.
i
think
congress
made
clear
that
it
wanted
all
the...
that
in
tort
cases
it
wanted
all
the
agencies
to
be
treated
the
same,
and
i
think
the
court
should
hesitate
before
creating
a
major
exception
to
that
kind
of--
mr.
paul
bender
--may
i
answer
justice
scalia's
question?
i
think
when
you
read
the
legislative
history
you'll
see
that
one
of
the
objectives...
not
just
the
result
of
what
they
were
doing,
but
one
of
their
objectives
was
to
unify
the
procedure
so
all
federal
agencies
would
be
treated
the
same
for
the
purposes
of
tort
claims.
thank
you
very
much.
