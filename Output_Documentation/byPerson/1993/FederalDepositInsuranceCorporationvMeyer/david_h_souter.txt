justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you,
sir?
if
he
had
been
fired
by
the
bank,
if
there
hadn't
been
the
takeover,
would
he
have
had
a
contract
claim
under
state
law
against
the
bank?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
did
have
a
right
under
his
contract
to
pre...
in
effect,
to
pre-deprivation
process,
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
his
due
process
claim
was
that
he
didn't
get
pre-deprivation
process.
would
he
have
had
a
contract
claim
to
the
same
effect
against
the
bank?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
suppose
it's
perhaps
restating
the
same
point
that
i
take
it
you're
not
claiming
that
the
government
is
scot-free
here
of
liability
on
the
claim
asserted
simply
because
it
was
acting
as
a
regulator
and
not
as
a
mere
successor
to
the
originally
contracting
party?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
--except
that
was
pre-bivens.
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
simply
reading
out
of
the
statute
the
description
of
the
government's
liability
as
if
it
were
a
private
party.
i
mean,
that
qualification
isn't
in
the
legislative
history
you
were
reading,
but
it
is
in
the
statute,
and
that
is
what
excludes
its
reference
to
bivens,
because
there
is
no
analogous
private
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you...
i'm
sorry.
finish
your
sentence.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
claim
that
the
state
law
has
anything
to
do
by
way
of...
by
way
of
law
or
analogy
with
defining
the
degree
of
process
that
you
are
entitled
to,
and
protection
of
the
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
in
deciding
that,
should
we...
could
we
reasonably
ask
the
question,
what
process
he
would
have
had
against
the
bank
as
a
private
entity
if
the
bank
had
simply
terminated
him
prior
to
the
assumption
by
fdic,
or
whatever,
of
the
receivership?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question.
could
i
follow
on
this
one
before
you
let
him
off?
[laughter]
i
really
don't
follow
it.
it
seems
to
me
you've
looked
to
the
state
to
find
the
property
right,
and
you
claim
to
be
looking
to
the
constitution
for
finding
the
procedural
right,
which
is
the
basis
of
your
suit,
but
when
i
ask
you,
where
is
that
procedural
right
in
the
constitution
because
if
it's
there,
everybody
who
has
a
contract
with
the
government
would
have
it,
you
fall
back
upon
the
regulation,
and
you
say,
well,
the
regulation
entitles
you
to
this
procedure.
where
do
you
get
the
constitutional
right
just
by
virtue
of
having
the
state
property
right
and
without
aversion
to
the
regulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
going
to
work
into
your
argument
later
on.
you're
not
depending
on
state
law
as
the
source
of
the
process
that
is
due,
and
you're
not
depending
on
the
federal
regs
as
the
source
for
the
process
that
is
due.
you're
saying
the
process
that
is
due
somehow
should
be
appropriate
to
the
state
law
contract
right,
property
right,
and
that
is
a
right
to
continued
employment
in
the
absence
of
cause
to
discharge.
why,
then,
do
you
say
that
the
process
that
is
due
includes
merely
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
employee
to
say
why
he
shouldn't
be
discharged,
as
opposed
to
an
obligation
on
the
government
to
establish
that
cause
for
why
he
should
be?
it
seems
to
me
the
only
reason
to
make
that...
to
choose
the
former
rather
than
the
latter
is
that
it's
probably
a
little...
may
look
a
little
easier
to
win
the
case.
it
puts
less
of
a
burden
on
the
government,
but
i
don't
see
in
principle
why
you
take
that
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mistook
you,
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
there
is
one
difference,
and
that
is
the
federal
government
chooses,
for
whatever
reason,
voluntarily
to
pay
in
the
one
case
and
it
doesn't
choose
in
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question...
the
issue
of
what
is
appropriate
for
the
court
is
what
is
it...
in
recognizing
the
bivens
action
is
a
question
of
what
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
do
in
imposing
liability
involuntarily,
and
you're
suggesting
an
analogy
with
liability
voluntarily
assumed.
i
don't
see
the
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
does
the
gun
come
from?
you
don't
have
to
reimburse
these
people.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
might
cause
timidity,
and
that
may
be
why
the
government
wants
to
pay
the
bill.
i
can
understand
that,
but
it
still
is
a
voluntary
assumption
of
a
responsibility.
