chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
92-741,
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
v.
john
a.
meyer.
mr.
bender.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
position
did
the
respondent
here
occupy,
mr.
bender?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bender,
the
first
question
you
present
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
fslic
can
be
held
liable
for
tort
damages
arising
on
a
bivens
cause
of
action.
now,
you're
choosing,
i
take
it,
to
argue
the
second
question
you
present
first?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
take
it
you're
also
going
to
argue,
eventually,
your--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
talk
about
repudiating
past...
or
liability
for
past
contractual
breaches,
does
it?
i
mean,
you're
going
to
be
held
liable
on
a
contract
measure
of
damages
whether
you
technically
repudiate
the
thing
or
just
admit
you
didn't
perform.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
there
an
inconsistency
in
your
position,
though,
mr.
bender,
because
you
say
that
the
receiver's
rights
are
not
dependent
on
state
law,
and
that...
that
it
has
rights
coming
from
the
federal
regulations
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
yet
his
remedy
is
purely
state
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bender,
you
will
get
to
your
first
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
mr.
felice,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
regulation
that
allows
the
receiver
to
terminate
a
contract
that
he
deems
burdensome?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
that
would
be
true
of
any
employee
that
the
receiver
came
in
and
decided
to
fire
for
the
good
of
the
institution.
every
one
of
them
would
have
a
right
to
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
hearing,
and
presumably
a
right
to
pursue
in
court
any
claim
that
they
have.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
should
assume
it's
a
relevant
question,
since
it's
asked
by
a
member
of
the--
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
we
ever
held
an
agency
liable
on
a
bivens
cause
of
action
as
opposed
to
individuals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
you're
asking
us
to
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you--
--mr.
filice,
the
government
says,
i
think
with
some
reason,
that
your
argument
about
cognizability
based
on
1346
runs
contrary
to
our
decision
in
smith.
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
your
theory,
and
it
may
be
factually
distinguishable
from
smith,
but
certainly
the
entire
analysis
of
smith
suggests
that
your
definition
of
cognizable
is
too
narrow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
talking
about
the
legislative
history
of
what
happened
in...
i'm
talking
about
our
opinion
in
smith,
which
assumes
a
much
broader
definition
of
cognizable,
i
think,
than
you're
willing
to
concede.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
at
the
time
congress
legislated
1346(b),
which
was
1946,
there
were
no
such
thing
as
constitutional
torts
recognized.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
argue
one
way
or
the
other
from
that,
but
just
like
you
say
that
you
can't
really
draw
much
analysis
from
the
1946
action
since
bivens
came
much
later,
the
whole
idea
of
constitutional
torts
came
much
later.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
filice.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
