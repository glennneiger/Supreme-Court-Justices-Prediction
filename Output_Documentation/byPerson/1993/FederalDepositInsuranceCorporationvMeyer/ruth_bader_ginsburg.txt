justice
ruth
bader

if
you're
right,
mr.
bender,
about
your
argument
that
there
is
no
due
process
right
of
the
nature
claimed,
wouldn't
that
go
to
the
receiver,
pattullo,
as
well
as
to
the...
fslic?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
position,
if
you
would
prevail
on
that
second
argument
that
you
make
that
there
is
no
due
process
right
to
tenure
as
against
this
federal
agency,
then
pattullo
should
never
have
gone
to
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
never
get
to
the
question
of
qualified
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
addition
is
the
process
that
is
due,
is
the
claim
that
can
be
asserted
against
the
assets
of
the
failed
association--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that
is
the
full
extent
of
the
process
that
is
constitutionally
due.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bender,
is
it
part
of
your
argument
that
the
bivens
claim
simply
doesn't
extend
to
agencies
as
distinguished
from
individuals,
so
that
in
no
case...
forgetting
about
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause...
should
one
think
of
a
bivens
claim
as
against
an
entity
as
distinguished
from
an
individual?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
bender,
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause
came
in
when,
as
opposed
to
when
the
bivens
claim
was
created?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
language
in
the
legislative
history
is
not
in
the
statute
itself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
--is
not
cognizable
under
1346(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
again,
you're
referring
to
legislative
history...
legislative
history
prior
to
bivens?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bender,
what
you're...
you're
making
the
argument
that
congress
really
mean
to
bracket
sue-and-be-sued
agencies
with
all
other
agencies
for
tort
claims
act
purposes
but
they
used
incomplete
language
so
the
court
should
kind
of
fix
up
the
language
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
also
counsel
hesitation
that
you'd
have
this
anomaly
of
the
difference
between
the
sue-and-be-sued
agencies
and
other
agencies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
if
the
federal
law
is
more
favorable
to
the
employee
and
says
you
must
show
that
it's
unsafe
or
unsound,
we
must
find
it
burdensome...
the
federal
law's
more
favorable,
then
there
is
a
constitutional
right,
but
if
the
federal
law
is
harsher
and
just
says,
everyone
goes,
there
is
no
constitutional
right,
that's
a
strange--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
when
you're
hired
by
the
state
entity,
or
by
the
savings
and
loan,
you're...
to
determine
the
nature
of
your
property
interest,
you're
looking
to
the
day
when
that
institution
is
going
to
go
under
and
be
taken
over
by
a
federal
receiver,
and
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you've
tacked
onto
the
state-created
property
right
the
federal
regulation.
you
said
you
have
to
judge
it
by
this
man's
expectancy,
and
his
expectancy
at
the
time
was
that
you
would
have
this
state
law
right
to
employment,
and
tacked
onto
that
this
federal
regulation
that
says,
can't
get
rid
of
you
unless
it's
unduly
burdensome,
or
whatever,
so
you
are...
you're
not
relying
just
on
the
state
law
to
create
this
right
that
attracts
the
due
process
guarantee.
you
said,
it's
state
law
plus
federal
regulation.
you
need
the
federal
regulation
in
there
to
create
that
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
know,
we've
had
so
many
discussions
about
what
is
this...
the
contours
of
this
right,
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
qualified
immunity
defense
that
was
available
to
pattullo,
why
wasn't
that
available
to
the
fslic
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
except
that
congress
has
made
all
other
agencies
totally
immune.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
my...
what
sense
does
it
make
to
say
that
this
agency,
unlike
the
individual,
is
liable
without
a
qualified
immunity
defense,
and
all
other
agencies
are
totally
immune?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
were
talking
about
the
scope
of
this,
you
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
this
would
be
a
right
that
all
employees
would
have.
you
have
to
have
somebody
who
has
kind
of
tenure
expectancy,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
wipe
out
the
entire...
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
beside
the
point,
because
the
immunity...
we
should
go
back
and
rethink
the
entire
immunity
doctrine,
but
even
if
you...
even
if
we
did
that,
you
have
a
problem
of
extending
bivens
to
an
agency
something
you
conceded
has
never
been
done
before.
why
aren't
there
the
factors
that
counsel
hesitation
here
against
extending
bivens
to
an
agency
when
that's
never
been
done
before,
when
the
payment
will
have
to
come
out
of
the
federal
fisc
as
distinguished
from
an
individual's
pocket?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
no
thought
at
all,
mr.
filice,
of
anything
like
a
bivens
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
asking
us
to
extend
the
bivens
doctrine
to
so
far
new
territory.
whatever
the
tort
claims
act...
whatever
our
role
with
respect
to
that
is,
the
bivens
doctrine
is
a
court-created
doctrine--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
you're
asking
us
to
extend
that
to
one
class
of
agency
uniquely.
