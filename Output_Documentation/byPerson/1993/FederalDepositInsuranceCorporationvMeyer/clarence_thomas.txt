justice
clarence
thomas
the
first
opinion
which
i
have
in
announcement
is
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
versus
meyer,
no.
92-741.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
acting
as
a
receiver
for
a
failed
thrift
institution,
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation,
fslic,
discharge
the
respondent,
meyer,
who
was
a
senior
officer
of
the
thrift.
in
a
suit
against
fslic,
respondent
claim
that
his
discharge
deprived
him
of
due
process.
after
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
in
respondent's
favor,
fslic's
statutory
successor,
petitioner
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
fdic,
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
first,
the
court
found
that
although
the
remedy
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
exclusive
for
all
claims
cognizable
under
1346(b)
of
the
act,
respondent's
constitutional
claim
was
not
so
cognizable.
second,
it
determined
that
fslic's
sue-and-be-sued
clause
constituted
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
the
claim.
and
third,
it
concluded
on
the
merits
that
respondent
had
been
deprived
of
due
process.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
like
the
court
of
appeals,
we
find
that
respondent's
claim
is
not
cognizable
under
section
1346(b)
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
a
claim
that
is
cognizable
under
section
1346(b)
if
it
is
actionable
under
that
section,
and
it
is
actionable
if
it
alleges,
among
other
things,
that
the
united
states
would
be
liable
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
occurred.
the
reference
to
the
law
of
the
place
means
that
the
law
of
the
state,
and
by
definition,
federal
law
is
not
state
law.
federal
law,
not
state
law,
provides
the
source
of
substantive
liability
for
a
claim
alleging
the
depravation
of
federal
constitutional
right.
we
also
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
fslic's
sue-and-be-sued
clause
waives
sovereign
immunity
for
respondent's
claim.
petitioner
fails
to
make
the
clear
showing
of
congressional
purpose
necessary
to
overcome
the
presumption
that
immunity
has
been
waived
by
the
clause.
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
we
hold
that
respondent
has
no
cause
of
action
for
damages
against
an
agency
of
the
federal
government,
in
this
case,
fslic's.
in
bivens
versus
six
unknown
federal
narcotics
agents,
we
implied
a
damages
remedy
against
federal
agents.
respondent
argues
that
the
logic
of
bivens
supports
extending
the
damages
remedy
from
the
agents
to
the
agencies.
we
disagree.
we
implied
a
cause
of
action
in
bivens
against
the
agents
in
part
because
a
direct
action
against
the
agency
was
not
available.
in
essence,
respondent
asked
us
to
imply
a
damages
action
based
on
a
decision
that
itself
presumed
the
absence
of
that
very
action.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
