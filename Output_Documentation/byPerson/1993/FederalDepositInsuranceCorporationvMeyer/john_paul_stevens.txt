mr.
bender,
he
didn't
have
a
state
law
tort
claim,
did
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
we
analyze
the
case,
don't
we
assume
he
has
no
tort
remedy
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
cognizable,
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
had
a
tort
remedy,
couldn't
it
arguably
be
said
then
the
federal
tort
claims
act
would
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
bender,
isn't
it
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
even...
if
he
had
a
state
law
right
to
recover
assets
from
the
bank
which
in
turn
would
give
him
a
right
to
pretermination
hearing,
maybe
he
would
lose
against
the...
on
his
state
contract
claim
but
nevertheless
be
able
to
argue
that
if
you'd
given
me
the
hearing
to
which
i
was
entitled,
i
could
have
persuaded
you
not
to
fire
me,
because
i
really
wasn't
involved
in
all
this
stuff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do,
let
me
just
ask
one
question.
in
the
normal
government
situation,
supposing
the
head
of
the
agency
has
a
right
to
terminate
the
employment
of
anyone
whom
he
thinks
is
not
performing
adequately
in
his
sole
discretion
with
no
review,
but
he
has
to
make
a
determination
that
he's
not
performing
adequately.
right
to
a
hearing,
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
because
it
has
a
state
analog
for
private
parties,
which
a
constitutional
tort
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
it
could
mean
claims
that
have
a
counterpart
in
state
law.
