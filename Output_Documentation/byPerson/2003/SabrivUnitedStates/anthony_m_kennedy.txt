suppose
that,
just
to
use
an
analogy
in
the
private
sphere,
a
major
corporation
has
a
choice
of
two
subcontractors
and
one
subcontractor
is
known
for
engaging
in
lots
of
bribery
and
kickbacks,
et
cetera.
it's
confident
that
it's
got
auditors
that
will
be
able
to
protect
it
in
this
instance.
but
don't
you
think
if
you
were
the
ceo
of
the
corporation,
you'd
rather
prefer...
rather
deal
with
the
subcontractor
that
was
always
clean?
it's
just
a
common
sense
business
judgment,
and
that's
all
the
government
is
doing
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
has
relation
because
it
wants
to
give
its
funds
to
those
entities
that
it
has
confidence
in
with
respect
to
all
of
their
operations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
united
states
v.
perez.
we
took
a
very
expansive
view
of
the
commerce
clause.
and
it
was
pretty
much
of
a
local
transaction
in...
in
the
case,
but
the
court
pointed
out,
you
know,
the
ripple
effect
that
all
commercial
transactions
have.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
m'culloch
language?
let
the
end
be
legitimate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
that...
that
to...
to
take
the
phrase,
the
clean
funnel
theory,
we
thought
that
that
theory
is
best
sustained
under
the
commerce
clause.
what
would
be
the
closest
case
that
we
could
cite
in
support
of
our
position
if
we
were
writing
under
the
commerce
clause?
are
there
cases
in
which
governmental
entities
and...
and
their...
the
integrity
of
the
operations
are
protected
under
the
commerce
clause?
have
we
ever
talked
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
governmental
entities
in
that
case,
as
i
recall.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
there
were
a
nexus
requirement
that
we
wrote
into
the
statute...
the
hypothetical
gets
a
little
murky
at
this
point...
would...
would
juries
have
to
find
that
there
was
a
nexus
or
could
the
judge
instruct--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
in
subsequent
trials,
if
we
found
a
nexus
requirement,
would
the
juries
have
to
determine
the
nexus?
