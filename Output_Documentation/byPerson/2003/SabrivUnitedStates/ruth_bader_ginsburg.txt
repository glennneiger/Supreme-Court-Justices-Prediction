to
spend
for
the
general
welfare
was
the
basis
in
the
court
below
and
that
combined
with
necessary
and
proper.
justice
ruth

and
that's
the
position
that
was
taken
below,
and
i
think
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
went
on
that

ground.

the
justification
sounds
like
a
spending
clause
justification,
doesn't
it,
that
the...
that
they
could
not
by
a
lesser
means
safeguard
these
federal
funds?
they
tried
narrower
statutes
and
they
didn't
work.
but
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
to
safeguard
the
integrity
of
the
money
that
they
were
giving
to
these
units
by
not
having
corrupt
operations.
isn't
that
the
case?
justice

why

that
not
satisfactory?

whether
they
regard
it
as
an

rather
a

to

its
money.

it
something

mr.
dreeben,
what
answer
do
you
give
to
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
eighth
circuit
who
said
it
is
now
a
federal
crime
for
an
auto
mechanic
to
induce
a
public
high
school
principal
to
hire
him
to
teach
shop
class
by
offering
free
car
repair?
