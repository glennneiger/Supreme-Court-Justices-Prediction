well,
have
we
ever
said
it
can't?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
it's
kind
of
hard
to
read
dole
for
that
proposition.
i
may
have
missed
your
response
to
an
earlier
question.
you...
you
bring
a
facial
challenge.
why
should
we
entertain
a
facial
challenge?
what
if
we
treated
it
as
an
as-applied
challenge?
do
you
say
the
government
cannot
prove
the
elements
that
you
think
are
necessary
and
thereby
obtain
a
conviction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't...
we
don't
normally
entertain
facial
challenges
to
statutes
on
a
ground
like
that.
if
it
could
be
applied
properly
in
an
individual
case,
why
would
we
entertain
the
broader
challenge?
justice

mr.
dreeben,
i
am
concerned
about
the
breadth
of
your
reliance
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
and
the
spending
clause
power
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
federal
funding
extends
to
a
huge
range
of
activities,
and
why,
under
your
theory,
couldn't
congress
make...
take
over
the
entire
criminal
law
scheme
because
it
affects
federal
taxpayers?
i
mean,
i
don't
see
any
limit
to
your
theory,
and
i'm
curious
why
you're
so
reluctant
to
rely
on
the
commerce
clause.
what's
going
on
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
trying
to
overcome
the
problems
of
lopez
somehow,
get
a
new
thread
of
analysis
that
gets
you
out
from
under
that?
what's...
what's
happening
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
welfare
recipients--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--all
medicare
beneficiaries,
and
so
forth?
