we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
03-44,
basim
omar
sabri
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
birrell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
there's
no
doubt,
mr.
birrell,
is
there,
that
in
some
circumstances
the
statute
could
be
constitutionally
applied?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
here
congress
does
not
rely
on
the
spending
clause
because
it...
it
makes
conduct
criminal
against
an
individual.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if
congress
had
found
that
interstate
commerce
is
involved
here
and
did
not
provide
for
an
individual
jury
finding
in
every
case,
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
very
candid
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
your
time,
mr.
birrell?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
is
the
basis,
mr.
dreeben?
under
what
authority
did
congress
pass
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
congress
in
its...
in...
in
the
statute
says
there
must
be
some
connection
with
interstate
commerce,
then
certainly
it's
a
jury
issue.
and
justice
kennedy's
question,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
supposing
the
court
were
to
read
in
a
nexus
requirement,
just
exactly
what
congress
might
have
put
in.
you
say
that
would
not
be
a
jury
question
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
court's
decisions
have
been
consistent
on
that
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
should
we
take
that
into
consideration
deciding
the
question
before
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
you
have
a
new
executive
coming
in
who
is
really
hot
on
this
subject
and
says
we
want
to
prosecute
every
case
we
can
under
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
birrell,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
birrell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
03-44,
sabri
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
