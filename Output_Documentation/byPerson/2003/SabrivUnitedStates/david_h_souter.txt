justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
the
petitioner
sabri,
a
real
estate
developer,
proposed
to
build
a
hotel
and
retail
structures
in
minneapolis.
in
an
effort
to
forward
his
plans,
he
offered
three
bribes
to
a
city
councilmen
according
to
the
grand
jury
indictment
that
gave
rise
to
this
case.
sabri
was
charged
with
violating
18
u.s.
code
666,
which
makes
it
a
federal
crime
to
offer
a
bribe
of
$5000
or
more
to
an
agent
of
any
government
receiving
federal
benefits
of
at
least
$10,000
a
year.
in
2001
when
the
bribes
were
allegedly
offered,
the
city
council
of
minneapolis
got
about
$29
million
of
federal
funds.
sabri
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
for
failure
to
require
proof
of
a
connection
between
the
federal
funds
and
the
bribe
as
an
element
of
liability.
the
district
court
agreed
with
sabri,
but
a
divided
panel
of
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
there
was
nothing
fatal
in
the
absence
of
an
express
requirement
to
prove
some
connection
between
a
given
bribe
and
federally
pedigreed
dollars.
the
circuit
held
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
in
serving
the
objects
of
the
congressional
spending
power.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
split
among
the
courts
of
appeals
over
the
need
to
require
connections
between
the
bribe
and
the
federal
funds.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm.
sabri
raises
what
he
calls
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute.
it
is
fatal,
as
he
sees
it,
that
the
statute
does
not
make
the
connection
between
the
bribe
and
the
federal
funds
in
the
element
of
the
crime
to
be
charged
in
the
indictment
and
demonstrated
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
we
do
not
presume
the
unconstitutionality
of
federal
criminal
statute
simply
from
the
absence
of
an
explicit
jurisdictional
hook.
there
is
no
occasion
even
to
consider
the
need
for
such
a
requirement,
where
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
that
enforcement
of
a
criminal
statute
would
extend
beyond
the
legitimate
interest,
cognizable
under
article
i
of
the
constitution.
congress’
authority
under
the
spending
clause
to
appropriate
federal
moneys
to
promote
the
general
welfare
and
it
has
corresponding
authority
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
see
that
the
taxpayer
dollars
appropriated
under
that
power
are
in
fact,
spent
on
the
general
welfare,
rather
than
frittered
away
in
graft.
while
it
is
true
just
as
sabri
says
that
not
every
bribe
or
kickback
offered
or
paid
to
agents
of
state
and
local
governments
will
be
traceably
skimmed
from
federal
bequests,
this
possibility
does
not
portend
enforcement
beyond
the
scope
of
federal
interest.
money
is
fungible,
bribed
officials
are
untrustworthy
stewards
of
federal
funds,
and
corrupt
contractors
do
not
deliver
dollar-for-dollar
value.
in
a
postscript
we
observed
that
sabri’s
challenge
amounts
to
an
overbreadth
claim.
our
general
reluctance
to
entertain
facial
challenges
is
only
heightened
with
respect
to
this
species
of
suit.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
