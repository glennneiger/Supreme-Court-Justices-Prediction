is
that
true
of
the
drug
statutes
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
it
true
whenever
the
feds
prosecute
a
person
for
a
drug
transaction,
a
jury
has
to
determine
there
was
a
connection
between
these
drugs
and
interstate
commerce?
i've
never
heard
of
that
requirement
that...
that
the...
that
the
jury
would
have
to
determine
whatever
facts
are
necessary
for
the
statute
to
be
constitutional
even...
even
though
that's
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
does
that
come
out
of
a
case
or
someplace?
where
does
it
come
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
there
might
be
instances
where
there's
no
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
a
home...
you
know,
that...
that
will
be
an
issue,
homegrown
marijuana.
so
suppose
there
is
some
drug
somewhere
that
has
no
effect.
it
just
didn't.
there
could
be
such
a
thing.
we
can
imagine
it.
but
does
that
mean
in
all
these
other
cases
that
congress...
that
the
statute
is
void
because
the
jury
hasn't
found...
i'd
be
repeating
myself.
you
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
really
say
if
we
find
a
city
council
that
takes
money
and...
from
us,
the
city
council
takes
the
money
for
us
for
some
of
its
programs
here.
there's
a
corrupt
city
councilman.
we
want
to
prosecute
that
person.
why?
because
we
want
council...
members
of
councils
to
know
that
we're
not
going
to
tolerate
corruption
on
behalf
of
the
agency
that's
giving
out
our
money,
whether
in
the
particular
instance
it
involved
our
money
or
not.
now...
now,
why
isn't
that
sufficient
connection?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
why
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where...
where
does
this...
i
mean,
i've
asked
you
this
before,
but
i'm
not
sure.
where
does
this
jury
finding
thing
come
from?
it's
quite
interesting.
but...
but
where...
i
mean,
suppose
that
congress
passed
a
statute
under
the
patent
clause
criminalizing
certain
conduct
in
respect
to
patent,
and
at
the
border
there
might
be
an...
a
question
of
whether
it
does
or
does
not
fall
within
the
patent
clause,
that
particular
criminal
behavior.
but
i
wouldn't
jump
from
that
fact
that
you'd
have
a
legal
argument
it's
outside
the
patent
clause
to
the
conclusion
that
therefore
a
jury
has
to
find
in
every
patent
crime...
a
jury
has
to
find
that
it
is
within
the
clause.
i'd
have
thought
that
was
a
question
for
the
judge,
not
the
jury.
so
you've
been
emphasizing
the
contrary
idea,
and
where
do
you
get
it
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
massachusetts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
call...
call
this
the
clean
funnel
rationale.
the
agencies
are
funnels
funneling
money
to
the...
and
say,
look,
we
have
a
pretty
strong
rationale
here.
we
want
clean
funnels
because
a
little
bit
of
the
money
going
through
is
federal.
take
that
as
given.
if
i
were
to
say
you're
right,
what's
the
standard
where
the
spending
clause
is
at
issue?
what
words
would
be
used
there?
and
the
reason
that
this
is
difficult
at
the
moment
for
me
is
because
this
is
not
a
condition
imposed
upon
spending.
you're
not
saying
to
the
state,
we'll
give
you
the
transport
money
if
you...
this
is
really
a
federal
law
protecting
the...
the
spending.
you
may
be
right
in
this
case,
but
we're
going
to
have
to
say
some
kind
of
standard.
should
we
say
it's
just
whatever
would
be
necessary
and
proper
to
protect
the
object
of
the
spending,
which
is
quite
far
out
because
you
can
spend
for
things
you
don't
have
otherwise
have
the
power
to
do?
or
should
we
say
something
else,
or
should
we
say
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
here
because
if
in
fact
the
power
would
be
there
under
the
commerce
clause
anyway,
that
at
least
is
good
enough
and
isn't
a
stretch
of
the
spending
clause
where
there's
a
necessary
and
proper
rationale?
what
in
your
view
is
the
proper
way
to
write
those
words?
