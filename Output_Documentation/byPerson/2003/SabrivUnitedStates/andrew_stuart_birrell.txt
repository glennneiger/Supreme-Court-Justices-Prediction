mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
666(a)(2)
of
title
18
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
never
requires
the
jury
to
find
an
element
that
the
constitution
always
requires.
the
statute's
unambiguous
language
allows
a
violation
to
be
proved
with
entirely
local
conduct
unrelated
to
federal
spending.
it
thus
intrudes
deeply
into
an
area
the
court
has
recognized
as
one
in
which
the
states
possess
primary
authority.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
there
are
no
circumstances
where
66(a)(2)...
666(a)(2)
could
be
constitutionally
applied,
your
honor,
because
the...
because
the
statute
never
requires
that
the
jury
find
a
connection
between
the
federal
spending
and
the
offense
conduct.
in
the
same
way
that
there
were
possibly
circumstances
in
lopez
where
there
might
have
been
an
adequate
federal
connection,
but
because
the
jury
is
not
required
to
find
it,
there
are
not
any
circumstances
where
the
statute
could
be
constitutional.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
a
couple
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there
is
not
a
requirement
that
interstate
commerce
nexus
be
proved
in
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
well,
if
congress
could
create
commerce...
commerce
clause
jurisdiction
everywhere
that
it
could
spend
money,
then--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--because
without...
without
a
showing
that
in
each
case
there
was
a
connection
between
interstate
commerce
and
the
transaction--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
well,
unless...
unless
there
was
an
understanding
that
in
every
instance
there
was
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
then--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--i...
i
think
that
it
is
different
because
the
commerce
clause
is...
is
a
regulatory
power
that
permits
congress
to
regulate.
the
spending
clause
power
is...
is
a
different
sort
of
power.
it
does
not
make
that--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--i
believe
that
congress
passed
this
law
under
the
spending
clause
power.
i
believe
that's
what
they
intended
to
do.
all
the--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
it's
my
understanding
that
every
court
that
has
looked
at
this
has
said
that
congress
attempted
to
pass
this...
this
particular
statute
under
the
spending
clause.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
that
is
true,
your
honor.
they
could...
they
could...
the
statute
could
be
upheld
if
congress
has
the
power
to
do
it
on
any
basis.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
that...
that's
what
they
said
they
were
trying
to
do.
they
were
trying
to
regulate
the
integrity
of...
or...
or
police
the
integrity
of
organizations,
agencies,
and
local
and
state
governments
that
receive
federal
funds.
that's
what
they
said
they
were
trying
to
do.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
it's
not
satisfactory
because
the
statute
doesn't
require
any
connection
between
the
spending...
federal
spending
and
the
criminal
conduct.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
that's
not
what
the
government
is
doing
here,
your
honor.
what
the
government
is
doing
here
is
to
criminalize
purely
local
conduct.
they're
criminalizing
conduct
that
has
no
relation
to
any
federal
spending.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
well,
it
can
make
a
choice
about
giving
money
or
not
without
criminalizing
conduct.
congress
has
a
number
of
ways
that
it
can
protect
its
federal
money.
it
can
protect
it
under
commerce
clause,
property
clause,
not
giving
money,
relying
on
the
states
to
do...
to
do
what
they
need
to
do,
false
claims
act,
conditional
spending.
there's--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--because,
your
honor,
there
is...
it
may
be
that
what...
that
is
what
the
government
wants
to
do,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
government
has
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
it
doesn't
have
the
power
to
do
that
because
there's
not
an
element
in
the
statute
that
requires
there
be
a
connection
proved
between
the
federal
spending
and
the
wrongful
conduct.
there
may
be
one,
but
the
jury
is
not
required
to
find
one.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
it
might
be
if--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--assuming
it
wasn't--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--in...
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
it
might
be
coercive,
unduly
coercive,
but
other
than
that,
i
don't
see
a
problem
with
your
hypothetical.
but
there's
a...
the...
the
court...
this...
the
court
has
said
that
congress
can
attach
conditions
to
money
provided
that
the
four
dole
factors
are
met.
but
that
is
not
what's
occurring
here.
this
court
has
never
said
that
congress
can
use
the
spending
clause
power
to
create
a
criminal
law
statute.
and
the
danger
with
this
is--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--well,
only
inferentially
by
dole.
so
the
question
is
never
square
with--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--i...
i
say
that
we...
we
properly
bring
a
facial
challenge
because
the
statute
has
no
element
requiring
a
connection
between
the
federal
spending--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--this
statute
cannot
be
properly
applied
in
any
case.
it's
always
unconstitutional
because
it
lacks
this
connection
element.
the
statute
is
like--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--yes.
well,
there
are
two
concepts,
both
that
there's
not
an
element
and
that
the
jury
doesn't
need
to
find
it.
this
statute
is...
is
like
the
statute
in
lopez.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
congress
didn't
make
that
finding.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
well,
in
the...
in
the...
in
your
honor's
patent
clause
hypothetical,
that
is
a
case
where
the
court
would...
or
the
congress
would
have
a...
an
enumerated
regulatory
power.
this
is...
this
is
a
different
thing.
now--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--this
case
is
like
lopez
because
the
way
i
read
lopez...
i
mean,
i
understand
your
point
about
whether
the
conduct
in
lopez
was
commerce
conduct
or
not,
but
the
way
i'm
reading
lopez
is
that
the
point
is
that
when
you're
on
the...
the
fringes
of
the
power,
commerce
power
in
that
case,
that
there
needs
to
be
a...
an
element
where
the
jury
would
find
in
each
case
that
there
was
a
connection
between
the
exercised
power
of
congress
and
the
conduct.
so
in
our
case--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--well,
you've...
you've
told
me
that...
that
the
court
has
said
that
there
is,
and
i...
i
accept
that.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
well,
i
would
return
to
my
point
that
i
think
that
if
the
congress
can
create
commerce
clause
jurisdiction
by
spending
money
and
congress
is
entitled
to
spend
money
under
the
constitution
anywhere
it
deems
it
important
for
the
general
welfare,
then
what
would
naturally
follow,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
general
police
power
that
the
constitution
denies
to
the
federal
government.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
inescapable
chain
of
reasoning
that
will
get
us
there.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
there...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
it,
and
i
don't
have
anything
to
offer
outside
the
record
of
it.
but
the...
the
question
whether
the
local
governments
or
government
agents
consent
to
an
invasion
of
their
area
of
authority
is...
is
not
dispositive.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
well,
the...
the
statute
doesn't
require
the
federal
government
to
be
acting
to
protect
its
money.
there...
there
is
not
any
requirement
that
this
money
be
the
government's
money.
for
example,
a
private
citizen
offers
a...
a
bribe
to
an
agent.
it
could
be
an
agent
of
a...
a
corporation.
the
offer
is
refused
and
12
months
later
and
for
the
first
time
more
than
$10,000
is
given
to
an
unrelated
part
of
the
agent's
business,
the
business
the
agent
works
for.
then
we
now
have
a
federal
crime
committed.
there's
not
any
requirement
in
the
statute
that
there
be
a
connection
between
the
federal
money
and
the
offense
conduct.
and
furthermore,
there's
not
any
requirement
that
the
jury
find
it.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
thank
you,
your
honor.
turning
first
to
the
discussion
about
salinas,
salinas
did
not
decide
the
issue
presented
in
this
case.
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
not
before
the
court
in
salinas.
salinas
was
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
what
the
court
appeared
to
do
was
to
conduct
a
harmless
error
review
because
the
constitutionality
had
not
been
raised
in
the
briefs,
was
not
in
the
cert
petition,
and
it
does
not
impede
our
facial
challenge.
i
think
that
this...
this--
mr.
andrew
stuart
birrell
--i
think
that
if
the
constitutional
issue
had
been
raised
in
salinas,
it
would
have
come
out
the
other
way,
yes.
i
think
as
well
that
if
i
could
direct
the
court
to
page
34
of
our
brief,
that
this
will
respond
to
the
discussion
about
the
element,
that
this
is
an
analysis
about
the
element
in
lopez.
we
would
submit
the
same
would
apply
here.
there
are
many
noncommercial
applications
of
this
statute,
for
example,
bribery
regarding
civil
rights
law.
so
i
don't
think
the
commerce
clause
is...
is
the
answer.
furthermore,
in...
666(a)(2)
doesn't
even
require
any
actual
recipient
corruption
because
the
third
party
to
the
funding
contract
under
(a)(2)
can...
can
offer
a
bribe
to
an
absolutely
incorruptible
official
and
yet
still
be
charged
with
a
federal
crime.
the...
the
overreaching
question
in
this
case,
your
honors,
is
that
federal
power
must
have
judicially
enforceable
limits
and
this
statute
ignores
them
and
is
unconstitutional
in
every
instance.
thank
you.
