mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
section
666
does
not
require
proof
of
a
federal
connection
between
the
offense
conduct
and
the
federally
funded
program
or
federal
funds
beyond
that
which
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
requires.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
has
relied
on
congress'
necessary
and
proper
clause
authority
to
protect
its
spending
clause
expenditures
and
programs
in
this
case.
i
recognize
that
the
commerce
clause
could
also
provide
a
basis
for
congress
to
reach
transactions
involving
criminal
activity
that
affect
commerce,
but
this
court
in
salinas
v.
united
states,
in
describing
why
section
666
was
constitutional,
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
that
case,
discussed
that
there
was
a
legitimate
federal
interest
in
protecting
the
particular
program
that
corruption
had
affected
in
that
case.
and
the
outgrowth
of
section
666
historically
is
of
an
effort
by
congress
to
improve
on
previously
deficient
methods
of
protecting
federally
funded
programs.
there
were--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
this
court
recognized,
as
recently
as
last
terms
in
jinks
v.
richland
county,
that
analysis
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
is
deferential,
tracing
its
roots
back
to
m'culloch
v.
maryland,
but
there
is
an
attenuation
element
to
the
analysis.
the
law
does
need
to
be
conducive
and
plainly
adapted
to
the
end
that
congress
is
seeking
to
protect.
and
in
your
example
of
$1
to
a
state
and
then
protection
through
criminalizing
the
activities
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
agents,
there
might
be
an
attenuation
problem.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
okay.
the
annual
budget
of
california
is...
at
least
in
1999,
was
$242
billion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
the
federal
government--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
there's
not
a
drop.
there's
a
virtual
flood.
there
was--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
does,
justice
scalia,
but
congress
was
well
aware
that
every
state
is
the
recipient
of
billion
upon
billions
of
dollars
in
federal
aid.
there
is
substantial
federal
money
flowing
to
all
of
the
states,
and
congress
could
have
dispensed
with
any
dollar
limitation
whatsoever
with
respect
to
state
aid
and
simply
made
a
per
se
finding
that
federal
money
is
so
infused
into
the
state's
budgetary
activities,
federal
programs
are
so
pervasive--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
of...
as
of
1999,
california
received
$35,955,000,000.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
i
have
minnesota
too.
[laughter]
minnesota
received...
minnesota's
budget
was
$36
billion,
and
it
received
4,000,000,496
federal
dollars--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
i
only
have
30
minutes
and
there
are
50
states.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
o'connor--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
think
there
are
ample
avenues
for
the
federal
government
to
legislate,
when
things
involve
interstate
commerce,
without
worrying
about
lopez.
i
believe
the
court
could
uphold
the
statute
as
a
regulation
of
interstate
commerce,
but
it
was
clearly
not
designed
with
that
in
mind,
and
this
court
did
not
so
regard
it,
or
at
least
didn't
articulate
itself
as
regarding
it
that
way
in
salinas
v.
united
states.
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
solve
was
a
very
particularized
problem,
not
the
generalized
problem
of
there
is
crime
in
america,
therefore
it
will
affect
federally
funded
activities.
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
solve
was
that
it
would
give
federal
money
to
particular
entities
to...
to
administer
federal
programs,
and
there
would
be
crime
that
had
the
potential
to
affect
those
federal
interests,
but
because
of
deficiencies
or
perceived
deficiencies
in
prior
statutory
law,
that
crime
could
not
be
prosecuted.
in
particular,
with
theft
crimes
there
was
a
problem
because
once
title
had
passed
with
the
money
to
the
local
entity
or
state
entity,
some
courts
were
saying
that
was
no
longer
theft
from
the
federal
government
and
the
theft
statute
didn't
apply.
with
respect
to
the
federal
bribery
statute,
18
u.s.c.
201,
lower
courts
had
divided
on
whether
state
and
local
officials
who
were
administering
federal
programs
could
be
held
accountable
as
federal
officials.
and
to
remedy
those
deficiencies
of
prior
law,
section
666,
as
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
aptly
described
it,
changed
the
enforcement
paradigm,
and
it
said
that
what
we
want
now
is
not
to
focus
on
particular
federal
monies
that
we
have
difficulty
tracing
into
federally
funded
entities
or
who
is
a
federal
official.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
entities
that
we
fund
to
carry
out
federal
assistance
programs
are
clean,
and
the
way
that
we
are
going
to
do
that
is
to
draft
a
prophylactic
statute
that
ensures
that
all
agents
who
are
involved
in
the
authority
to
conduct
business
on
behalf
of
the
entity
are
not
engaged
in
significant
acts
of
theft,
embezzlement,
or
bribery.
it,
therefore,
included
various
limitations
in
section
666
that
prevent
it
from
being
an
all-encompassing,
all-devouring
statute
that
sweeps
in
all
related
crimes
to
the
entities
that
are
funded.
there's
a
$5,000
limitation
with
respect
to
the
transactions
that
are
going
to
be
influenced.
it's
not
every
traffic
ticket
that
is
issued
by
any
state
agency.
and
there
is
a...
a
condition,
of
course,
that
there
be
$10,000
of
federal
money
going
into
the
entity.
of
course,
there
are
going
to
be
cases
under
this
statute
where
it
will
be
difficult
to
articulate
a
clear--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's...
could
be
a
one-shot
deal.
it's
a
$10,000
grant
during
a
12-month
period
that
spans
the
offense
conduct
in
question.
and
as
i
was
saying--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
the
offense
conduct
has
to
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--any
1-year
period,
but
there's
another
provision
in
the
statute
that
makes
clear
that
the
period
can
include
time
before
the
offense
conduct
and
time
after
the
offense
conduct,
which
is
naturally
read
to
mean
that
it
has
to
span
the
offense
conduct.
and
that
provision
was
designed
to
overcome
the
difficulty
that
state
and
local
agents
would
be
bribed
for
activities
that
they
would
have
the
power
to
engage
in
once
the
federal
money
was
awarded
to
their
agency.
and
in
anticipation
of
federal
money
coming
into
the
entity,
the
officials
could
engaged
in
corrupt
conduct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
scalia,
within
limits.
i
think
that
there
could
be
a...
a
point
in
time
at
which
the
court
might
say
that
if
the
federal
government
passed
a
statute
that
said
every
robbery
involves--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--all
money--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
court...
the
court
long
ago
upheld
in
united
states
v.
hall
a
statute
that
prevented
fraud
and
embezzlement
directed
at
funds
going
to
veterans.
so
it
has
already
upheld
statutes
in
which
the
federal
interest
in
protecting
the
beneficiary's
use--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
this...
this
statute,
though,
i
think
rests
on
a
generalization
that
is
less
attenuated
and
more
reasonable
than
statutes
that
would
take
the
form
of
the
statute
your
honor
has
described.
this
statute
basically
says
if
you
have
corrupt
officials
in
the
entity
that's
getting
federal
money,
we
have
reason
to
worry
that
you
have
poor
internal
controls,
that
you
have
a
culture
of
corruption,
that
you
have
insufficient
mechanisms
to
root
it
out,
and
that
the
officials
that
are
engaged
in
corruption
today
with
respect
to
state
money
may
tomorrow
be
engaged
in
corruption
with
respect
to
federal
money.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
most
logical
way
to
write
this
opinion
is
to
rely
on
the
test
that
this
court
articulated
in
1819
through
chief
justice
marshall
with
respect
to
the
power
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
here
the
enumerated
power
that's
being
protected
is
the
spending
power.
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
was
long
ago
construed
to
give
congress
substantial
deference
to
past
laws
so
long
as
they
are
conducive
to
the
end
that
congress
is
trying
to
achieve
and
its
legitimate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's...
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
can't
think,
off
the
top
of
my
head,
justice
kennedy,
of
a
commerce
clause
case
that
was
specifically
directed
at
governmental
activity.
of
course,
this
statute
is
not
specifically
directed
at
governmental
activity.
it's
directed
at
any
fund
recipient,
be
it
private,
indian
tribe,
or
governmental.
so
the
court
could
rely
on
cases
probably
like
reno
v.
condon
in
which
the
court
upheld
a
law
that
dealt
with
an
item
in
commerce,
be
it
in
the
hands
of
the
government
or
in
hands
of
private
parties.
and
of
course,
united
states
v.
perez
did
uphold
a
very
broad
view
of
the
congress'
power
to
regulate
transactional
conduct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no
governmental
entities
in...
in
perez,
but
of
course,
this
case
doesn't
focus
on
governmental
entities
as
such.
what
it
focuses
on
them
is...
it
focuses
on
them
in
their
capacity
as
administrators
of
funds
that
are
paid
out
under
federal
assistance
programs.
it
treats
them
identically
to
private
entities
that
also
receive
federal
funds
under
federal
programs,
which
is
strong
evidence
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
here
was
ensuring
that
its
purposes
and
goals
under
the
spending
clause
aren't
frustrated
by
corruption
within
whatever
entity
it
is
that
happens
to
be
taking
the
funds
to
administer
the
program.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
18
u.s.c.,
section
641,
which
was
the
federal
theft
statute,
was
really
a
protection
of
federal
property,
and
that
probably
could
be
justified
under
a
variety
of
enumerated
powers
under
article
i.
18
u.s.c.,
section
201
was
the
federal
bribery
statute
that
primarily
focuses
on
people
who
are
federal
officials
or
who
are
designated
to
become
federal
officials.
and
this
court
in
united
states
v.
dixson
interpreted
the
statute
to
cover
state
and
local
officials
who
were
administering
federal
programs
because
they
were
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
and
with
respect
to
that
branch
of
section
201,
although
the
court
did
not
address
the
constitutional
question
in
dixson,
i
think
that
the
proper
grant
of
authority
to
analyze
it
is
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
as
applied
to
the
spending
power
because
it,
like
section
666,
criminalizes
the
activities
of
non-us
persons
because
they
are
engaged
in
an
activity
that
relates
to
federally
funded
programs.
so
the
theory
of
protecting
through
criminal
law
the
misdeeds
of
agents
that
may
impair
federal
programs
or
impair
federal
funds
is
not
new.
what
was
new
about
section
666
was
its
removal
of
the
impediments
that
congress
found
in
the
prior
law
so
that
it
could
have
an
effective
mechanism
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
its
programs.
the
case
that
is
before
the
court
today
is
a
facial
challenge
to
section
666,
arguing
that
it
is
always
and
everywhere
unconstitutional.
that
submission
is
impossible
to
reconcile
with
this
court's
decision
in
salinas
v.
united
states
which
specifically
said
that
as
applied
to
the
conduct
in
that
case,
where
there
was
a
connection
to
a
federal
program,
the
statute
was
constitutional
as
applied.
what
that
means
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
correct
in
holding
that
section
666
is
not
facially
unconstitutional.
it
leaves
open
whether
there
is
an
as-applied
constitutional
challenge
to
section
666.
no
such
challenge
was
brought
in
this
case,
and
the
united
states
made
a
proffer
to
the
district
court
indicating
how
the
particular
bribery
in
this
case
would
have
had
an
effect
on
federal
funds
and
federal
programs,
making
clear
that
no
such
as-applied
challenge
would
have
succeeded.
so
the
only
way
that
petitioner
can
prevail
in
this
case
if
this
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
notwithstanding
its
prior
decision
in
salinas,
holding
that
section
666
was
constitutional
as
applied,
it
now
turns
out
that
section
666
is
facially
unconstitutional
and
can
never
be
applied
to
anyone
anywhere.
we
submit
that
that
is
incorrect.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
judging
from
the
way
that
this
court
resolved
the
salinas
decision,
justice
kennedy,
it
would
be
a
constitutional
as-applied
challenge
to
be
resolved
by
the
court.
this
court
in
salinas
said
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
as
applied
and
there
had
been
no
jury
finding
on
any
nexus
requirement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
that
they
would,
justice
kennedy.
just
as
in
a
case
like
new
york
v.
ferber
where
the
court
held
that
child
pornography
can
be
outlawed
across
the
board,
the
statute
is
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
invalid
on
overbreadth
grounds.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
court
left
open
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
as-applied
challenges,
and
it
didn't
suggest
that
those
as-applied
constitutional
challenges
would
raise
jury
issues.
they
would
instead
raise
issues
of
law
for
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
am
judging,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
by
the
way
that
this
court
resolved
the
legal
issue
in
the
salinas
case.
the
court
would
have
two
options
open
to
it
if
it
decided,
contrary
to
our
arguments
today,
to
read
in
some
sort
of
a
nexus
requirement.
it
could
do
what
the
second
and
third
circuits
have
done,
which
is,
we
think
incorrectly,
superimpose
on
the
statute
as
an
implicit
element
that
has
no
textual
foundation
some
sort
of
a
federal
nexus.
now,
if
the
court
did
construe
section
666
to
require
a
federal
nexus,
that's
clearly
a
jury
issue
under
united
states
v.
gaudin.
every
element,
be
it
implicit
or
explicit,
has
to
be
found
by
the
jury.
but
alternatively,
i
understood
justice
kennedy
to
be
suggesting
that
there
could
be
a
constitutional
overlay
to
ensure
that
there
was
no
unconstitutional
application
of
section
666,
and
if
it's
treated
as
a
pure
constitutional
question,
then
i
think
the
better
reading
of
this
court's
decisions
is
that
it
would
be
a
question
of
law--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
they
have
been
groping
towards
consistency.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
so
long,
justice
ginsburg,
as
the
statutory
valuation
elements
are
met,
that
the
transaction
involves
$5,000
or
more,
which
it
probably
would,
given
teacher
salaries,
then
it
would
be
covered
by
section
666,
and
the
government
would
have
discretion
to
prosecute
it.
i
think
what
that
illustrates
is
that
the
broad
prophylactic
approach
that
section
666
takes
leads
easily
to
the
manufacturing
of
hypotheticals
that
seem
attenuated
from
core
federal
interests.
and
the
choice
that
congress
had
before
it
was
to
draft
a
statute
that
would
go
to
that
degree
of
breadth
but
eliminate
impediments
that
had
previously
hobbled
the
enforcement
of
a
law
or
draft
a
statute
which
congress
believed
was
both
under-inclusive
and
would
put
to
the
jury
perhaps
difficult
and
murky
issues
of
whether
there
really
was
a
federal
connection
that
justified
application
of
the
statute.
and
let
me
give
an
example
because
it's
a
very
important,
classic
example
of
the
way
that
we
use
section
666.
suppose
that
there
is
a
city
council
person
or
a
mayor
or
some
other
official
who
has
responsibilities
for
some
respect...
in
some
respects
administering
a
federal
program
or
federal
funds,
and
he
turns
out
to
be
engaged
in
corruption
with
respect
to
non-federal
monies
and
non-federal
programs.
the
government
wants
to
prosecute
him
to
ensure
that
he
doesn't
begin
to
widen
his
field
of
operation
and
harm
the
federal
program,
but
in
the
facts
that
can
actually
be
proved,
there's
no
connection
between
the
federal
program
and
the
offense
conduct.
conceivably
could
a
statute
be
drafted
that
would
allow
the
government
to
say
that's
the
kind
of
federal
nexus
that's
covered?
certainly,
but
there
are
many,
many
hypotheticals
where
the
potential
injury
to
federal
interests
is
not
necessarily
going
to
be
easy
to
articulate
and
prove
to
a
jury.
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
the
united--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
scalia.
if
it's
a
question
of
law,
is
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied,
then
the
defendant
should
have
the
burden
of
establishing
that.
but
i
understood
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
to
raise
the
question
what
if
congress
had
drafted
a
narrower
statute
that
had
some
sort
of
an
offense
nexus
element.
then
we'd
have
to
prove
it
up.
the
united
states
attorneys
manual
does
direct
prosecutors
to
use
666
in
cases
where
there's
a
substantial
and
identifiable
federal
interest.
so
what
you
have
here
is
a
combination
of
congress
saying
we
need
a
statute
that's
adequate
to
vindicate
federal
interests
and
prior
efforts
to
draft
narrower
ones
have
frustrated
that
goal.
we're
going
to
draft
a
broader
statute.
and
then
the
federal
executive
branch
uses
its
discretion
to
prosecute
cases
that
do,
indeed,
pose
a
real
threat
to
federal
interests.
now,
that's
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
it's
not
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
and
it's
not
as
a
matter
of
what
the
statute
provides.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
not
relevant,
strictly
speaking,
to
the
constitutional
question.
what
it
is
relevant
to
is
why
it
was
rational
for
congress
to
draft
a
somewhat
broader
statute
without
fearing
that,
by
virtue
of
having
given
the
executive
branch
this
power,
state
criminal
law
would
be
thoroughly
swamped,
i
believe
as
one
of
the
dissenting
opinions
said.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
then
i'll
have
to
withdraw
this
statement.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
i
often
say
that
the
only
way
that
we
get
uniformity
in
federal
criminal
law
enforcement
is
from
a
decision
by
this
court.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
