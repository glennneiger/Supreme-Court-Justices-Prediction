justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
can't
it
be
constitutional
under
the
commerce
clause?
i
know
the
government
doesn't
rely
on
that,
but
respondent
can
be
supported
here
on
any...
any
ground.
why...
why
isn't
this
a
commercial
transaction
as...
as,
you
know,
our...
our
commerce
clause
law
is?
so
long
as
the
transaction
is
commercial,
we
will
assume
it's
interstate
commerce.
we'll
accept
congress'
judgment
on
that.
why
isn't
a
commercial
transaction
when
you
bribe
somebody?
money
for...
for
whatever
the
favor
he
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
necessary.
so
long
as
it's
commercial,
our
cases...
our
recent
cases,
say
so
long
as
it's
commercial,
we'll
accept
congress'
judgment
that
it's
interstate.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
not
everywhere
it
could
spend
money.
everywhere
there
is
a
commercial
transaction.
one
of
our
cases,
for
example,
held
that
loan-sharking
could
be
covered
under
the
commerce
clause
because
it
was
a
commercial
transaction,
just
as
illegal
as...
as
the...
the
bribery
here,
but
if
that
could
be
covered
by
the
commerce
clause,
why
can't
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
our
cases
require.
justice
antonin
scalia
does...
does
it
matter
what
they
intended
to
pass
it
under?
i
mean,
if
they
have
the
power
under
another...
under
another
head,
would...
would
that
not
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
federal
government
had
recast
the
statute
and
said
no
state
can
get...
what's
the
limit...
$10,000
or
more
from
the
federal
government
unless
it
agrees
to
criminalize
and
impose
the
same
penalty
set
forth
here
for
any
state
corruption.
would
that
be
constitutional
under
the
spending
power?
it's
a
condition
to
the
grant.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
unquestionably
would
be,
wouldn't
it?
it's
take
it
or
leave
it.
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
connected
to
the
grant.
it
has
some
remote
connection
to
it.
that
ought
to
be
enough.
it
just
seems
very
strange
to
me
that
the
federal
government
would
be
able
to
compel
the
state
to
impose
such
criminal
penalties,
but
it
cannot
itself
do
so
in
connection
with
its
spending.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
because
it
lacks
the
requirement
of
a
jury
finding
that
there
was
the
connection.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
has
the
commerce
clause
power.
i...
i
don't
understand
your
reliance
on
lopez.
you
just
said
just...
just
as
lopez
was
bad,
whether
or
not
there...
lopez
was...
was
bad
because
it
was
not
commerce,
which
is
a
judgment
that
this
court
will
make,
whether
it's
commerce
or
not,
but
once
it
is
commerce,
you're
in
a
different
ball
park.
once
it
is
commerce,
we
assume
it's
interstate
commerce,
and
that
explains,
you
know,
a
whole
bunch
of
our
cases,
such
as
our
loan-sharking
cases.
so
lopez
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
lopez
was
not
commerce.
now,
you...
you
may
argue
that...
that
bribery
is
not
commerce
although
loan-sharking
is,
but
i'm
not
sure
how
strong
an
argument
that
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
there
is
such
a...
such
a
connection
with
loan-sharking,
good,
old,
local,
you
know,
break-your-knees
loan-sharking.
it's
not...
not
an
interstate
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
far
does
that
go?
what
if...
what
if
the
federal
government
gave
the
state
$1?
could
it
make...
could
it
make
it...
it
a
crime
for
any
person
to
bribe
any
state
officer
anywhere
in
any
program
at
all?
you
know,
the...
really
is...
is
there
no
end
to
the...
to
the
scope
of
congress'
purported
protection
of
its
funds?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
$10,000
is...
is
clearly...
what's...
what's
the...
what's
the
annual
budget
of
new
york
state,
do
you
know,
or
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
242
billion
dollars.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
because
there's
$10,000
of
federal
money,
a
drop
of
federal
money
in
this
sea
of...
of
california
funds,
the...
the
federal
government
can
control
the
whole
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
but
for
the
statute
to
apply,
it
takes
only
$10,000.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much
does
it
give
california?
i
just...
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
a
big...
a
big
figure.
i
believe
you,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
my
fault.
i
brought
it
up
as
a
hypothetical.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
$10,000
annually
or
is
it
just
a...
could
it
be
a
one-shot
deal?
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
the
state
got...
i
mean,
the
way
you
read
it,
just
because
you
got
$10,000
last
year
doesn't
mean
that
next
year
you're
still
subject
to
the
act.
it
has
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--during
the
year.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
in
any
1-year
period,
but
i...
i
assume
that
that
means--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
assume
this
means
that
the
federal
government
could
also
criminalize
federally
robbery
or
burglary
committed
against
a
private
individual
who
has
received
federal
funds,
who
has
received
a
federal
subsidy
in
one
way
or
another.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
probably
all
of
us,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
limited
to
the
funds,
though.
it
didn't
say
anything
you...
anybody
who
gets
any
money
from
a
veteran
is...
is...
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
this
says.
anybody
who...
who
bribes
any
state
official,
whether
the
federal
funds
are
at
issue
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
write
that
down.
groping
towards--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can...
i
can
use
that
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who...
whose
burden
is
it?
i
mean,
assume
we
accept
your...
your
proposition
that
we
should
uphold
it
on
its
face,
at
least,
and
that
future
as-applied
challenges
will
still
be
allowed.
would
it
be
the
burden
of
the
defendant
to
establish
that...
that
this
goes
too
far,
that
this
is
not
reasonable
protection
of
the
federal
monetary
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
an
even
more
realistic
hypothetical
is
the
united
states
attorney
in
chicago
or
new
york,
who
are
not
always,
shall
i
say,
responsive
to
the
directives
of
central
justice,
bringing
a
prosecution
against
a
political
opponent
that
has
really
no
connection
with
a
federal
interest.
that
might
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
think
salinas,
had
the
constitutional
been
raised,
would
have...
should
have
come
out
the
other
way.
