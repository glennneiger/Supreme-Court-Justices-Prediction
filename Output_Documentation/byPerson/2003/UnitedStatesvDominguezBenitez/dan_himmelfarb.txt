mr.
dan
himmelfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
consistently
held
in
both
harmless
error
and
plain
error
cases
that
an
error
affects
substantial
rights
if
it
affected
the
outcome
of
the
district
court
proceeding.
applying
that
principle
to
a
violation
of
rule
11
at
a
guilty
plea
proceeding,
9
of
the
12
courts
of
appeals
that
hear
criminal
cases
have
concluded
that
a
rule
11
error
affects
substantial
rights
if
it
affected
the
defendant's
decision
to
plead
guilty,
which
means
that
the
defendant
would
not
have
gone
forward
with
his
plea
if
the
error
had
not
occurred.
that
standard
is
correct.
the
ninth
circuit
standard
which
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--in
the
context
of
a
guilty
plea,
i
think
it
is,
justice
stevens.
that's
the
relevant
decision.
this
court's
cases
have
applied
the
harmless
error
and
plain
error
effect
on
substantial
rights
element
in
a
variety
of
circumstances:
at
a
detention
hearing,
during
the
course
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
most
frequently
a
trial,
of
course,
and
also
at
sentencing.
each
of
those
four
circumstances,
the
court
made
clear
that
the
relevant
question
was
whether
the
effect
of
that
particular
proceeding
would
have
been
the
same--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--if
the
error
had
not
been
made.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
think
the...
we
think
it's
directly
analogous
to
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
context.
in
that
context,
you
have
a
deficient
performance
by
the
defendant's
lawyer
in
connection
with
advice
about
a
guilty
plea.
and
this
court's
decision
in
hill
v.
lockhart
makes
clear
that
the
next
step
of
the
strickland
analysis,
the
prejudice
analysis,
is
whether
but
for
that
deficient
performance,
the
defendant
would
not
have
pleaded
guilty
and
would
have
gone
forward
to
trial.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
think
the
same
rule
applies
here.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
this
court's
decision
makes
clear
in
vonn
that
the
defendant
has
a
burden,
of
course,
rejected
the
contention
in
that
case
that
no
matter
when...
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
when
a
rule
11
error
occurs,
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
no
effect
on
substantial
rights.
the
holding
of
vonn
is
that
the
defendant
bears
the
burden.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
what
that
standard
is,
and
we
think
again
it's
directly
analogous
to
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
context.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
o'connor,
that's
exactly
our
position.
our
position
is
that
a
straightforward
application
of
olano--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--it
certainly
is,
justice
o'connor.
we
make
two
alternative
arguments,
one
under
the
third
prong
of
the
plain
error
rule,
one
under
the
fourth.
our
primary
submission
is
that
in
order
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
the
plain
error
rule...
in
other
words,
in
order
to
show
an
effect
on
substantial
rights...
that's
right...
a
defendant
has
to
show
that
the
error
affected
his
decision
to
plead
guilty.
our
alternative
argument
is
that
the
court...
even
if
the
ninth
circuit
standard
is
correct
so
that
a
defendant
would
not
have
to
show
that
the
error
affected
his
decision
to
plead
guilty
in
order
to
show
an
effect
on
substantial
rights
and
he
could
therefore
satisfy
the
third
requirement
of
the
plain
error
rule,
he
can't
satisfy
the
fourth
requirement
unless
he
makes
that
showing.
and
we
think
that
conclusion
follows
from
this
court's
decisions
in
cotton
and
johnson
where
the
court
assumed,
without
deciding,
that
the
failure
to
submit
an
element
of
the
offense
to
the
grand
jury
or
the
petit
jury
affected
substantial
rights,
but
held
that
the
defendant
could
not
satisfy
the
fourth
requirement
of
the
plain
error
rule
because
the
error
had
no
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
or
of
the
trial.
so
we're
making
two
alternative
arguments
here,
one
under
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
ginsburg,
my
understanding
is
that
there
is
a
bench
book
available
to
judges,
and
obviously
there
are
a
great
many
district
judges
in
the
united
states
district
courts
and
some
are
going
to
be
more
meticulous
than
others.
assistant
u.s.
attorneys
often
or
at
least
are
supposed
to
bring
checklists
with
them
to
a
guilty
plea
proceeding
so
that
they
can
ensure
that
rule
11
is
strictly
complied
with.
of
course,
a
prosecutor
has
no
more
interest
in
litigating
a
rule
11
error
on
appeal
than
anybody
else
does.
so
it's
very
much
in
the
prosecutor's
interest
to
try
to
ensure
that
there's
strict
compliance.
vonn
makes
clear,
though,
that
in
the
event
that
one
of
the...
one
of
the
advisements
slips...
and
there
was
only
one
here
that
the
district
judge
did
not
give...
it's
the
defendant's
burden
to
object
and
if
he
doesn't,
he's
in
a
plain
error
posture
on
appeal,
not
a
harmless
error
posture.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
don't.
the
record
is
silent
on
that
question.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
it
depends,
justice
scalia.
in
a
case
like
this,
we
think
a
defendant
would
not
reasonably
be
under
that
impression
because
in
this
case,
this...
this
defendant...
respondent
was
repeatedly
advised
that
the
judge
was
not
bound
by
the
guilty
plea
and
that
he
would
face
a
10-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence
if
the
parties'
recommendation
was
not
followed.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
agree,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
why
we
think--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that...
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
not
at
all,
justice
stevens.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no.
there
may--
[laughter]
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
my
point
is
that
in
a
case
like
this
where
a
defendant
is
advised
that
the
judge
is
not
bound
by
the
parties'
agreement,
it's
probably
not
reasonable
for
that
defendant
to
assume
that
he
can
withdraw
his
plea
if
the
judge
doesn't
follow
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
exactly
right.
that's
our
position,
justice
scalia.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
that's
likely
to
happen.
district
judges
are
generally
quite
conscientious
about
complying
with
rule
11.
prosecutors
are
generally
quite
conscientious
about
making
sure
that
district
judges
comply
with
rule
11.
nobody
has
an
interest
in
having
appellate
litigation
over
rule
11
errors.
everyone
has
an
interest...
everyone
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
rule
11
is
strictly
complied
with
so
that
the
judgment
of
conviction
can
be
entered
and
people
can
move
on
to
other
business.
so
i
don't
think--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no.
my--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
have
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal.
the
ninth
circuit
standard
is
if
the
error
is
not
minor
or
technical
and
the
defendant
wasn't
otherwise
aware
of
the
omitted
information,
he
shows
an
effect
on
substantial
rights.
our
position
is
that
knowledge
of
the
omitted
information
is
a
sufficient
condition
to
defeat
a
claim
that
there
was
an
effect
on
substantial
rights,
but
it's
not
necessary.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
it's
a
subjective
standard,
justice
kennedy.
in
the
context
of
a
guilty
plea,
when
the
question
is
whether
the
error
affected
the
defendant's
decision
to
plead
guilty,
the
relevant
question
is
whether
this
particular
defendant
would
have
pled...
would
have
gone
to
trial.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
you
don't.
you
can't
because
by
definition
in
the
plain
error/harmless
error
context,
you're
limited
to
the
record
on
appeal.
objective
considerations
are
obviously
relevant
in
making
the
subjective
determination
of
whether
this
particular
defendant
would
have
pled
guilty.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
there
could,
justice
kennedy.
for
example,
if
the
defendant
had
moved
to
withdraw
his
plea
after
he
pled
but
before
sentencing,
it
might
have
been
within
the
district
court's
discretion
to
hold
a
hearing
and
you
could
have
had
the
defendant
testify
at
that
hearing.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
right.
under...
under
rule
11,
a
defendant
can
move
to
withdraw
his
plea
for
any
reason
before
it's
accepted.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
exactly
right.
it
wasn't
raised
at
any
point
in
the
district
court,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no.
after
sentencing,
the
rule
makes
clear
a
defendant
can't
move
to
withdraw
his
plea.
the
only
way
he
can
attack
his
plea
is
by
direct
appeal
or
a
collateral
attack.
but
before
sentencing
it's--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--sure.
it
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge
and
his
willingness
to
testify.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
there's...
there's,
of
course,
a
requirement
that
you
file
a
direct
appeal.
otherwise
you
will
have
procedurally
defaulted.
i
should
also
say
that
this
court
held
in
timmreck
that
a
formal
violation
of
rule
11,
which
is
all
that
we
have
here,
is
not
cognizable
in
a
2255
proceeding.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
in
the
ordinary
context,
the
relevant
decision-maker
is,
of
course,
the
judge,
and
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no.
we
think
your
formulation
is
exactly
the
right
way
to
think--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
can.
the...
an
affect
on
substantial
rights
means
that
there's
an
affect
on
the
outcome.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
let...
let
me
qualify
that...
that
answer
if
i
could,
justice
breyer.
that
is
the
general
rule.
there
are,
of
course,
certain
types
of
error,
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
which
do
not
require
a
showing
of--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
sometimes
the
question
will
be
whether
the
third
requirement
of
the
plain
error
rule,
which
is
a
substantial
rights
requirement,
has
been
affected.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
certainly
don't,
justice
breyer.
i...
i
don't
believe
respondent
does,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
take
that
position
either.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
know
as
an
empirical
matter
which
is
more
likely
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
is
aware
of
what's
in
the
plea
agreement,
sitting
down
with
a
lawyer
and
a
spanish
interpreter
as
happened
here
and
having
the
three
of
them
go
over
the
plea
agreement,
having
the
spanish
interpreter
translate
it
for
the
defendant
in
the
presence
of
counsel
so
that
the
defendant
can
ask
any
questions
of
counsel
that
are
necessary
and
counsel
can
answer
them,
on
the
one
hand,
or
the
suggestion
which
you
just
made.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
again,
i'm
not
sure
whether
that's
true
as
an
empirical
matter.
as
a
legal
matter,
the
question
here
is
when
a
defendant
has
forfeited
a
claim
of
error
and
he
has
to
show
an
effect
on
substantial
rights
on
appeal,
if
you
have--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--again,
justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
don't
think
it's
ordinarily
the
practice
of
u.s.
attorney's
offices
to
provide
spanish
translations
of
plea
agreements
to
spanish
speakers
who
don't
speak
english.
it's
always
the
practice,
whether
the
translator
is
at...
comes
at
the
defendant's
expense
or
the
court's
expense,
for
a
translator
to
translate
the
plea
agreement
for
the
defendant
in...
in
the
presence
of
counsel.
i...
i
don't
know
what
would
be
the
source
of
any
requirement
for
the
government
to
provide
a
spanish--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
the
defendant,
of
course,
knew
that
he
had
three
prior
convictions
and
not
just
one.
i'm
not
sure
what
bearing
that
fact
has
on
the
plain
error
analysis
in
this
case
because
it's
not
just
the
fact
of
the
prior
convictions
that
would
have
rendered
this
defendant
ineligible
for
a
sentence
below
the
mandatory
minimum.
there
has
to
be
a
guidelines
calculation
and
assignment
of
criminal
history
points
to
each
conviction,
and
if
you
get
above
one
criminal
history
point,
you're
not
eligible
for
a
sentence
below
the
mandatory
minimum.
so
you
would--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--one
could
reasonably
conclude
that
he
should
have
had
substantial
doubt
about
whether
he
would
have
been
eligible
for
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no.
that's--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
that's
true,
justice
stevens.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
rule
11
imposes
a
requirement
on
the
district
judge
to
advise
the
defendant
of
his
rights.
nobody
disputes
that
that
didn't
happen
here
for
one
of
the
advisements
and
nobody
disputes
that
there
was
therefore
rule
11
error.
nor
does
anybody
dispute
that
it
was
a
plain
error.
but
since
defendant
didn't
object...
respondent
didn't
object
in
the
district
court,
we're
in
a
plain
error
posture.
that
is
a
difficult
standard
to
meet.
he
has
to
show
not
only
that
there's
an
error
that's
plain,
but
he
has
to
satisfy
these
two
other
requirements
that
i'll
mention.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
o'connor,
it
is
absolutely
the
case
that
in
undertaking
this
analysis,
a
court
should
and
ordinarily
will
look
at
objective
factors.
in
most
cases--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--we
think
that...
we
agree
that
we
win
under
either
an
objective
or
a
subjective
standard,
given
the
strength
of
the
case
against
respondent
and
given
the
fact
that
he
received
a
substantial
benefit
from
pleading.
we
think
that
a...
a
subjective
test
is
the
appropriate
one
because
this
is
not
a
situation
like
you
have
when
there's
trial
error
and
you
have
to
determine
whether
the
jury
objectively
would
have
reached
the
same
decision--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
justice
kennedy,
we
think
that
if
he
did
knew...
if
he
did
know,
that's
a
sufficient
basis
for
rejecting
his
claim
because
if
he
knew,
the
fact
that
the
judge
didn't
tell
him
a
second
time--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--we...
we
have
no
problem
with
the
question
ninth
circuit
asks.
our
problem
is
that
they
stopped
after
they
asked
that
question.
that
should
probably
be
the
first
question.
if
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
defendant
was
otherwise
aware
of
the
omitted
rule
11
information,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
that
he
would
have
gone
to
trial
if
the
judge
had
omitted
to
say
something
that
he
already
knew.
that's
why
we
think
that's
a
sufficient--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--in...
in
the...
when
a
defendant
is
confronted
with
a
choice
of
pleading
guilty
or
going
to
trial,
he
has...
he,
of
course,
has
an
absolute
right
to
go
to
trial.
no
matter
how
strong
the
evidence
is
against
him,
no
matter
what
benefits
he
could
get
from
pleading
guilty,
if
he
chooses,
for
whatever
personal
or
idiosyncratic
reason,
to
go
to
trial
despite
those
things,
he's
got
the
right
to
do
it.
that's
why
we
think--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
think
that's
right.
let
me...
let
me
just
add
this
point
to
what
i've
already
said.
while
the
objective
question
of
whether
a
reasonable
defendant
in
the
defendant's
circumstances
would
have
pleaded
is
not,
we
think,
the
correct
analysis
under
the
third
component
of
the
plain
error
rule,
we
do
think
it
could
be
taken
into
account
in
connection
with
the
fourth
requirement,
which
is
the
discretionary
component.
so,
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
situation
where
a
defendant
for
some
idiosyncratic
reason
was
intent
on
going
to
trial,
even
though
it
was
essentially
suicidal
for
him
to
do
that,
he
might
be
able
to
satisfy
the
third
requirement
because
it
affected
his
decision
to
plead
guilty,
but
a
court
could
permissibly
say,
that
doesn't
serious
affect
the
fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings
because
he
undoubtedly
would
have
been
convicted
if
he
had
gone
to
trial
