justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
may
of
1999
the
respondent,
carlos
dominguez
benitez,
agreed
to
sell
methamphetamine
to
a
federal
informant.
dominguez
was
arrested,
confessed,
and
faced
federal
drug
charges
that
carried
a
statutory
and
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
ten
years.
the
prosecutor
agreed
to
recommend
that
dominguez
escaped
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence
by
qualifying
for
a
so-called
safety
valve
that
another
statutory
provision
makes
available.
dominguez
pleaded
guilty
under
that
agreement.
the
written
plea
agreement
contained
the
warning
that
dominguez
could
not
withdraw
his
plea
if
the
court
departed
from
the
party’s
recommendation.
the
district
court
should
have
given
dominguez
the
same
warning
orally
again
in
the
plea
colloquy
for
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
require
the
court
to
give
that
warning,
but
the
district
court
mistakenly
failed
to
give
it.
the
court
and
counsel
later
learned
that
dominguez
had
prior
convictions
that
disqualified
him
for
the
safety
valve.
the
court
therefore
departed
from
the
recommendation
of
the
plea
agreement
and
imposed
the
mandatory
10-year
minimum
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
although
dominguez
had
not
timely
objected
to
the
district
court’s
failure
to
warn
that
he
could
not
withdraw
his
guilty
plea,
the
failure
to
give
the
warning
in
violation
of
rule
11
was
plain
error
that
effected
dominguez’s
substantial
rights.
the
court
held
that
was
enough
that
the
error
was
not
minor
or
technical
and
that
dominguez
did
not
understand
the
rights
at
issue
when
he
pleaded
guilty.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
showing
a
defendant
must
make
to
obtain
relief
for
unpreserved
rule
11
error.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
vacate
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
we
recently
held
in
united
states
v.
vonn
that
a
defendant
who
does
not
object
to
a
rule
11
error
at
trial
must
satisfy
the
plain
error
standard
of
the
united
states
v.
olano
which
requires,
among
other
things,
that
an
error
affect
a
defendant’s
substantial
rights.
the
phrase
substantial
rights,
usually
means
that
an
error
must
have
prejudicial
effect
on
the
outcome
of
a
proceeding
and
we
see
no
reason
to
depart
from
that
general
meaning
in
this
case.
we
apply
a
standard
we
have
used
in
other
cases
where
a
defendant
must
establish
prejudice
or
materiality.
dominguez
must
show
a
reasonable
probability,
but
for
the
error
he
would
not
have
entered
the
guilty
plea.
the
standard
satisfies
the
policy
of
the
plain
error
rule
to
encourage
timely
objections
and
it
also
respects
that
particular
importance
of
the
finality
of
guilty
pleas
which
are
indispensable
to
the
modern
criminal
justice
system.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
