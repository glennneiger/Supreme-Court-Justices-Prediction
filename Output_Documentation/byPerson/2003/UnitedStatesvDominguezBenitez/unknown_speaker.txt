unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
this
one
question?
because
i'm...
i'm
not
at
all
sure
of
the...
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
the...
in
terms...
effect
of
the
decision
necessarily
is
equated
to
the
fact
he
would
not
have
otherwise
have
pleaded
guilty?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--except
that
we...
i
mean,
the...
the
meaning
of
that
term
varies.
in...
in
some
contexts,
we
say,
well,
it's...
it's
enough
if...
if
confidence
in...
in
that
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
has
been
shattered.
in...
in
the
case
at
the
other
extreme
with
a
case...
we...
i
think
that
is
strongest
for
you,
we...
we've
said
in
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
context,
yes,
you've
got
to
show
that
he
wouldn't
have
pleaded
guilty
or
he's
got
to
show
that
he
wouldn't
have
pleaded
guilty
otherwise.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
the
issue
here
is,
is
this
enough...
is
the
context
here
enough
like
the
context
in
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
to...
to
put
the
heaviest
burden
on
the
petitioner,
or
is
it...
are
there...
are
enough
distinctions
so
that
maybe
the
burden
shouldn't
be
quite
that
heavy?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
no.
your...
we--
unknown
speaker
--let
me...
let
me
suggest
at
least
a
reason
why
maybe
it
isn't.
i'd
like
your
comment
on
it.
in...
in
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
context,
one
reason
for
putting
a
high...
you
know,
the
heaviest
burden
on
the
defendant
is
that
it
is
so
very
difficult
to
police
effective
assistance
as
you
go
along.
the
judge
watching
the...
the
plea
hearing
has
no
way
of
knowing
what's
going
on
or
has
gone
on
between
the
lawyer
and...
and
the
client.
here,
we're
in
a
different
position.
there...
there
are
a
couple
of
people
in
a
position
to...
to
avoid
the
kind
of
problem
that
we've
got
here.
one
obviously
is
the
federal
judge.
if
he
had
a
checklist
in
front
of
him,
something
like
this
wouldn't
have
happened.
the
second
is
counsel
for
the
government.
the
counsel
for
the
government
can
get
up
in
a
case
like
this
and
say,
judge,
you
forgot
something,
and
avoid
this
problem.
so
it
may
be
that
because
there
are
easier
ways
to
avoid
this,
the
burden
on
the
defendant
shouldn't
have
to
be
so
heavy.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
think
that
the
standard
for
plain
error
that
the
court
spelled
out
in
united
states
v.
olano
provides
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
that's
so,
olano's
fourth
prong,
if
you
will,
is
that
the
error...
asks
whether
the
error
seriously
affects
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand,
under
your
test,
how
that
fourth
prong
would
be
applied
or
if
it's
still
part
of
the
test.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
practical
aspect
of
it?
and
you're
asking
the
court
to
choose...
well,
the
plain
error
is
what
we're
doing
and
how
high
a
burden
the
defendant
would
have
to
meet.
but
this
relates
to
a
question
justice
souter
asked.
i
was
surprised,
given
that
this
was
not
a
new
district
judge,
that
she
didn't
have
a
litany
that
would
cover
all
the
rule
11
elements.
and
i
was
also
surprised
that
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
didn't
say
at
the
end
of
the
colloquy,
judge,
you
forgot
to
mention
that
this
plea
can't
be
withdrawn.
is
there
a
manual
that
judges
follow?
are
u.s....
assistant
u.s.
attorneys
instructed,
when
something
is
left
out
of
rule
11,
to
remind
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
mr.
himmelfarb,
is
it...
is
it
clear
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
believed
that
he
could
withdraw
his
plea?
do
we
know
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that...
that
a
defendant
making
a
guilty
plea
would
normally
believe
that
he
could
withdraw
it
when
the
government
has
promised
him
nothing
except
that
it
would
recommend
to
the
judge
a
certain
sentence?
unknown
speaker
if
i
was
given
all
of
that
information,
i...
i
certainly
wouldn't
leap
to
the
conclusion
that,
well,
if
the
judge
doesn't
accept
it,
i
can
withdraw
the
guilty
plea.
i
don't
know
why
he
would
naturally
believe
that.
i
would
think
he
would
naturally
believe
the
opposite.
unknown
speaker
wasn't...
wasn't
that
covered
in...
in
the
plea
agreement
itself
which
was
translated
into
spanish
for
him,
specifically
that
he
could
not...
he
could
not
withdraw
his
plea
if
the
judge
did
not
accept
the
plea?
unknown
speaker
your
basic
point
is
that
this
part
of
the
rule
is
pointless.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
that's
justice
scalia's
point.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
my
point
is
not
that
it's
pointless.
my
point
is
that
when
it
is
omitted,
it
does
not
necessarily
produce
substantial
injustice.
it's
a
good
idea
to
give
it,
of
course.
but
in
the
absence
of
giving
it,
i
would
think
that
normally
you'd
think
that
he
would
assume
that
anyway.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that's
right
and
i
were
a
district
judge,
i
could
probably
save
time
by
just
omitting
this
regularly
then.
unknown
speaker
even...
even
respondent
doesn't
argue
here
that
any
omission
from
the
rule
11
requirement
produces
an
automatic
reversal.
does
respondent
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean,
that's...
that's
not
the
theory
here,
that
if
you
don't...
if
you
don't
produce
an
automatic
reversal,
people
won't
give
the
rule
11
requirements.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
knowledge
of
requirement
a
wholly
subjective
test?
we...
we
want
to
know
what
this
defendant
thought.
or
is
it
what
a
reasonable
person
would
have
concluded
based
on
all
of
the
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
so
you
put
him
on
the
stand.
you
put
him
on
the
stand
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you're
limited
to
the
record
on
appeal.
could
there
have
been
a
hearing
in
the...
in
the
district
court
on
the
rule
11--
unknown
speaker
--but
after
sentence,
it's
impossible
for
him
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
but
he
didn't
do
that.
this
question
wasn't
raised
until
appeal...
the
appeal.
he
didn't
say--
unknown
speaker
--but...
but
my
question
is
in...
in
other
cases
it
would
not
be
possible
to
put
him
on
the
stand
at
any
time
after
sentencing.
unknown
speaker
on
collateral
attack,
could
he
take
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
under
your--
--can
you--
--excuse
me.
can
you
collaterally
attack
a
plea
before
you
appealed
and
sought
to
have
it
set
aside?
unknown
speaker
normally...
you
may
know...
i'm
just
drawing
on
your
background.
normally
when
you
say
did
it
affect
somebody's
substantial
rights,
when
i
see
those
words,
i
think
the
judge
did
something
to
this
person.
and
when
i
say
did
it
affect
his
substantial
rights,
i
think,
well,
did
it
matter
in
terms
of
what
the
judge
or
the
jury
did
to
him.
now,
is
that
a
correct
way
to
think
about
it?
are
there
other
instances
where
substantial
rights
means
something
different
than
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
not
talking
about...
i'm
saying
something
happened
to
this
human
being
who
is
there
in
court,
and
when
i
say
did
this
affect
his
substantial
rights,
i
usually
ask
myself
did
this
error
make
a
difference
in
terms
of
what
happened
to
him.
that's
how
i...
it's
very
colloquial,
but
that's
the
question
i
normally
ask
myself.
now,
maybe
all
these
years
i've
been
doing
it
wrong
or
maybe
there's
some
circumstances
where
i
should
ask
that
question.
you
know,
like
a
death
case,
which
is
a
horrible
case,
sometimes
there's
harmless
error
and
usually
the
question
there
is
did
it
matter
in
terms
of
his
being
sentenced
to
death.
those
come
up
a
lot.
i'm
just
asking
you
a
general
question.
i
don't
have
a
point
here.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
best
to
think
about
this.
unknown
speaker
fine.
if
that
is
the
correct
formulation,
can
you
think
of
other
instances
in
the
criminal
law
where
substantial
rights
meant
something
other
than
this
formulation?
unknown
speaker
that's
my
question.
i'm
asking
it
to
inform
myself
and
i
have
the
same
question
for
the
other
side
too.
unknown
speaker
like
structural
error.
that's
one
kind
of
exception.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
think
we
normally
speak
in
terms
of
substantial
rights
in
those
cases.
maybe
we
do.
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so...
so
structural
error
cases
are
an
instance
where
my
colloquial
question
is
not
right
and
nobody
claims
here
this
is
a
structural
error
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
himmelfarb,
there's...
there's
another
specific
about
this
case
that
might
have
averted
what
happened.
the...
the
entire
plea
agreement
was
read
to
the
defendant
in
translation
because
he
didn't
speak
english.
and
that
was
the
day
before.
if
it
had
been
the
practice
to
give
him
a
copy
of
the
translation,
instead
of
just
having
him
hear
it
orally,
then
it
would
have...
might
better
for
him
to
read
and
we
would
have
had
more
security
that
he
knew.
unknown
speaker
but
i
meant
both,
that
is,
that
there
would
be
the
written...
written-out
plea
agreement,
which
if
he
could
read
english,
he
could
have
read,
and
then
the
lawyer
and
the
translator
go
over
that
written
document
with
him,
that
that
i
think
would
be
more
effective
than
just
hearing
it
orally.
unknown
speaker
but
i
didn't
mean
this
to
be
legally
dispositive.
it's
in
the
same
way...
how
could
this
be
warded
off
so
we
don't
get
a
federal
case
out
of
these
rule
11
slips.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
wasn't
suggesting
that...
that
it
was
a
requirement.
may...
may
i
ask
just
one
more
puzzling
thing
about
this
case,
background
of
it?
the
reason
that
the
deal
didn't...
wasn't
possible
was
that
this
man
had
three
priors
instead
of
everybody
thought...
well,
at
least
the
judge
thought
or
the
prosecutor
thought,
until
the
presentence
report,
there
was
only
one.
but
the
defendant
must
have
known
how
many
priors
he
had.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
might...
you
might
say
that
the
fact
that
the
defendant
must
have
known
that
he
had
three
priors
would
have
made
him
realize
that
the
plea
agreement
probably
wouldn't
be
accepted.
unknown
speaker
are
you
assuming
he
understood
the
sentencing
guidelines
in
that
detail?
unknown
speaker
it'd
be
rather
unusual.
the
basic
problem
here
is
we're
dealing
with
dumb
defendants.
[laughter]
that's
the
problem.
that's
why
you
have
to
tell
them
twice.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
it
be
as
an
objective
test,
do
you
think?
i
don't
know
why
you
focus
on...
on
something
else.
i
mean,
can't
we
assess
whether...
in
determining
whether
it
affects
substantial
rights,
how
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
was,
what
the
benefits
of
the
plea
were,
and
what
he
was
told
in
just
objective
terms?
in
other
words,
reasonable
probability.
yes.
i
mean,
why
do
you
want
to
make
it
something
else?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
you
would
win
under
an
objective
test.
i
don't
know
why
you're
trying
to
urge
something
else.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
if
you're
doing
a
subjective
test,
you
might
as...
as
long
as
you're
doing
that,
why
not
accept
the
ninth
circuit
test:
did
he
know?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i...
i
thought
that
this
was
the
ninth
circuit
test
that
you
disagree
with.
and
my...
my
point
is
if
you're
going
to
go
this
objective
route,
you
might
as
well
ask
the
basic
question
as
the
ninth
circuit
did.
unknown
speaker
i
still
would
like
to
understand
why
you
think
an
objective
test
is
not
acceptable.
unknown
speaker
maybe...
maybe
you
think
the
courts
would
not...
would
not
stand
by
an
objective
test
in
the
situation
where
the
facts
are
such
that
any
intelligent
defendant
would
have...
would
have
made
the
plea
even
if
he
knew
that
it
couldn't
be
revoked.
but
this
particular
defendant,
for
whatever
reason...
and
it's
clear
on
the
record
he
told
his
counsel
or
he
left...
left
a
note
and
said,
well,
there's
no
harm
in
making
this
plea
because
i
can
always
withdraw
it
if
the
judge
doesn't
go
along
with
the
recommended
sentence.
and
in
that
situation,
i
think
it's
very
hard
for
a
court
to
say,
oh,
yes,
a...
since
a
reasonable
defendant
would...
would
have
gone
ahead
anyway,
this...
this
defendant
who
would
not
have
gone
ahead
anyway
must
be
held
to
his
guilty
plea.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
himmelfarb.
ms.
mossman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
why?
but
that's
not
so.
has...
has--
--i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--i
read
the
ninth
circuit.
it
seemed
to
me
we
said
just
what
you
said
we
said.
what
the
ninth
circuit
says
is
benitez
must
prove
that
the
error
was
not
minor
or
technical,
which
by
the
way,
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
because
a
minor
or
technical
error
could
well
affect
the
outcome.
and
then
it
says,
and
that
he
did
not
understand
the
rights
at
issue,
which
again
is
a
necessary
but
not
sufficient
condition.
now,
where
did
they
say
anything
about
substantial
rights?
they
used
those
words,
but
if
substantial
rights
means
what
i...
we
just
discussed,
which
i'd
like
your
view
about,
they
never
talked
about
substantial
rights.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
they
say
just
what
i
read?
unknown
speaker
so
why
isn't
it
like
summary
reverse?
we
said
this.
you
say
that.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
now,
then
what
does
affect
substantial
rights
mean?
now,
we
have
an
error
here
that's
not
minor
or
technical.
unknown
speaker
now
he,
in
fact...
let's
say
second...
did
not
understand
that
he
had
a
right
to
withdraw.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
the
end
of
the
thing?
unknown
speaker
ah,
ah,
where...
that's...
that's
the
point.
where
in
this
opinion
does
it
say
that's
not
the
end
of
the
matter?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
not
the
fourth
prong.
where
does
it
say
that's
not
the
end
of
the
matter
under
the
third
prong?
you
see,
i
could
have
a
nontechnical
matter.
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
could...
it
could
have
affected
my
understanding,
but
it
might
be
that
i
would
have
pled
guilty
anyway.
unknown
speaker
that's
what's
worrying
me.
unknown
speaker
and
the
most
obvious
case
is
where
the
judge
gives
me
the
sentence
i
hoped
for.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i'm
sorry.
a
terribly
minor,
terribly
important
error,
terribly
important.
indeed,
the
judge
has
a
whooping
cough
fit
and
nothing
comes
out
of
his
mouth,
but
he
gives
them
the
sentence
he
asks
for.
okay?
unknown
speaker
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
no.
the...
he
knew
nothing.
the
defendant
new
nothing.
it
was
a
major
error.
he
just
got
what
he
asked
for.
unknown
speaker
of
course.
unknown
speaker
of
course.
that's
what's
bothering
me.
unknown
speaker
if
in
fact
the
major
error...
and
he
did
not
understand
it...
made
no
difference
to
the
outcome,
then,
says
the
government,
he
shouldn't
be
able
to
appeal
it.
and
that's
the
problem.
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit,
they
didn't
make
that
last
statement.
unknown
speaker
and
they
want
an...
do
you
agree
with
them
that
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
go
back
and
to
say,
judge,
we
want
this
client
also
to
be
able
to
show
it
made
no
difference
to
the
outcome?
if
you
agree
with
that,
that's
the
end
of
the
case
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
do
you
know,
just
from
reading
rule
11,
which
errors
are
minor
and
technical
and
which
aren't?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you...
how
do
you...
what's
your
standard
for
telling
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
panoply.
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--but
just
a
moment
ago,
you
said
not
every
rule
11
violation
is
necessarily
not
minor
or
technical.
you
say
it's...
you...
i
thought
you
intimated
some
of
the
could
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
answer
a
rather
specific
question.
how
do
you
define
minor
or
technical?
unknown
speaker
did
the...
did
the
advisory
committee
purport
to
cover
all
possible
minor
or
technical
errors?
unknown
speaker
examples.
unknown
speaker
in...
in
assessing
how
weighty
this
particular
lapse
is,
should
we
take
into
account
that
as
far
as
i
know,
this
defendant
has
never
said
in
the
district
court
or
on
appeal
that
he
indeed
wants
to
go
to
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
he...
on...
on...
the
plea
vacated
is
one
thing.
unknown
speaker
because
then
you
have...
given
that
he
has
three
priors,
his
sentence...
he
was
sentenced
at
the
mandatory
minimum.
how
much
better
could
he
do
on
a
resentencing?
so
it's
got
to
be
he
wants
to
go
to
a
trial
because
do
you
agree
that
if
we...
if
we
just
say
new
sentencing,
he
couldn't
do
any
better
given--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
not
the
question
i
asked
you.
i
asked
did
he
ever
say
at
any
stage,
judge,
i'd
like
to
have
a
trial.
i
want
to
plead
not
guilty.
unknown
speaker
it's
not...
one
thing
not
to
object
to
a
setting
of
a
trial
date,
but
did
this
man
ever
say
i
want
to
exercise
my
right
to
trial
by
jury?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
was
stronger
than
that.
i
thought...
thought
he
had
said
at
one
point
i
don't
want
to
go
to
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
case,
if
he...
if...
but
his
concern
is
that
his
substantial
rights
or...
have
been
violated.
and
the
possible
effect
on
the
outcome
is
relevant.
and
my
question
is
how
could
the
outcome
be
affected
if
he
got
the
mandatory
minimum?
he
got
the
lowest
sentence
that
the
law
allowed
the
judge
to
impose.
so
unless
he
wants
to
go
to
trial,
he
isn't
harmed
by
what
happened.
and
so
i'm
asking
if
there's
any
stage
where
he
said,
i
want
to
go
to
trial.
unknown
speaker
what
was...
what
was
the
evidence
in
the
case?
what
was
the
evidence
against
him?
what...
what
did
the
government
have?
unknown
speaker
would...
would
anybody
in
his
right
mind
have
wanted
to
go
to
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
risk
getting
more
than
the
mandatory
minimum?
unknown
speaker
but
you...
you
have
looked
at
the
cases
on
entrapment.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you've
got
a
predisposition,
you
don't
have
much
of
a
prayer
on
a
entrapment
claim.
and
he
had
three
priors.
were...
were
the
three
priors
of
the
same...
same
line
of
commerce?
unknown
speaker
if...
if
you
were
to
prevail
and
he
were
to
have
a
trial
and
be
convicted,
could
he
get
a
more
lengthy
sentence
or
would
that
raise
problems
of
vindictive
prosecution?
would
failure
to
accept
responsibility
be
a
ground
for
an
increase?
unknown
speaker
that's
not--
unknown
speaker
--my
question
is
can
he
get...
if
he
gets
a
new
trial,
can
he
get
an
increased
sentence?
unknown
speaker
there's...
there's
no
vindictive
prosecution
problem?
unknown
speaker
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
you
argue
for
a
subjective
test
in
a
context
in
which
the
defendant
can't
take
the
stand
to
say
what
his
understanding
was.
that
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
me.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
but
you're
saying
that
you
want
to
subjective
test.
you
want...
you
want
to
defend
the
ninth
circuit
which
said
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
knew
that
he
had
this
specific
burden,
that
he
was
waiving
the
specific
right
the
minute
he
entered
the
plea.
and
you
want
a...
a
test
to
say
that
he
didn't,
in
fact,
know
that.
and
yet,
we
can't
put
him
on
the
stand.
that...
that
seems
to
me
an
odd
test.
unknown
speaker
an
odd...
an
odd
way
to
run
the
system.
unknown
speaker
but
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
follow...
didn't
find
that
his
plea
was
involuntary
in
a
constitutional
sense.
unknown
speaker
did...
did
they
say
it
was
a
constitutionally
invalid
plea?
unknown
speaker
ms.
mossman,
you've
been
asked
questions
by
several
different
members
of
the
court
and
you
don't
seem
to
really
respond
to
the
questions.
i'm
asking
you
a
very
specific
question
now.
unknown
speaker
i'm
rather
confused
because
are...
where...
there...
there
are
two
kinds
of
questions
we've
been
discussing.
one
is
whether
in
fact,
if
he
had
been
told
specifically,
what
he
was
supposed
to
be
told,
he
would
then
have
withdrawn
his
guilty
plea.
that's
question
one.
and
most
of
what
we've
been
talking
about
is
that.
but
i
thought
we're
actually
here
to
ask
a
different
question
and
the
different
question
is
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit...
and
i
did
think
that
from
reading
its
opinion...
said
what
we've
just
been
discussing
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter.
unknown
speaker
all
that...
all
that
the
person
has
to
show
is
that
he
didn't
understand
his
rights.
now,
what
do
you
think
about
that
question?
unknown
speaker
so
let's
assume...
it's
absolutely
clear.
they
can
come
in
with
52
bishops
who
are
prepared
to
swear
that
if
he
had
understood
everything
perfectly,
he
nonetheless
would
have
gone
ahead
and
pled
guilty.
but
it's
also
clear
he
did
not
understand
his
rights.
okay?
unknown
speaker
what's
supposed
to
happen?
unknown
speaker
oh,
there...
look,
what
happened
was
the
judge
never
told
him
that
you're
stuck
with
your
plea
if
i
don't
give
you
what
you
think
you're
going
to
get.
he
never
told
him
that.
it's
clear
in
rule
11
he
was
supposed
to.
and
now,
in
addition,
we
know
for
sure
that
this
person
didn't
understand
that.
but
we
also
know
for
sure
it
made
not
one
whit
of
difference
to
his
plea.
what's
supposed
to
happen?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
what
i
think
is
about
this
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
think
as
it's
presented
in
the
questions
presented
and
in
the
opinion
that
was
written
by
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
i
might
be
wrong
and
you
could
explain
to
me
why
i'm
not.
but...
but
in
any
case,
if
you
think
that
might
be
this
case
that's
presented
here,
i...
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
i'd...
i'd
like
an
answer
or
your
best
answer.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
in
fact,
we
know
he
never
would
have.
we
know
it
for
sure.
unknown
speaker
he's
written
secret
letters
to
his
relations--
[laughter]
--and
whatever.
do
it
in
any
sort
you
want,
but...
but
i
mean,
that's...
that's
a
little
bit
of
a
technical
matter
here.
but
i
did
think
in
reading
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
and
reading
the
government's
brief,
that
that's
what
they're
worried
about,
that
there
could
be
cases
where
he
does
not
understand
the
nature
of
that
rule
11
right,
but
nonetheless
it
makes
no
difference
to
his
decision
to
plead
guilty.
so
that...
that's
a
bit
of
a
technical
point
here,
i
agree.
but
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit,
i
thought,
well,
that's
what's
going
on
in
this
case.
now,
you
could
explain
to
me,
if
you
want,
that
i'm
completely
out
to
lunch,
so
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
would
they
give
him
a
better
deal
the
second
time
around?
i
mean,
they'd
say,
you
know,
okay,
we
forgot
to
tell
you
that
you
couldn't
withdraw
it.
we
now
tell
you
you
can't
withdraw
it.
and
we
offer
you
the
same
deal
we
offered
you
last
time.
why...
why
would
he
get
a
better
deal?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
they
might...
they
might
be
mad
at
him
for
having
backed
out
and...
and
not
give
him
as
good
a
deal.
but
i
can't
imagine
that
he'd...
he'd
get
a
better
deal
the
second
time
around.
unknown
speaker
what
leverage
does
he
have?
what
leverage
does
he
have
when
he's
face
with
a
mandatory
minimum
that
he
can't
escape
from
and
that's
what
he's
got?
i...
i
can't...
could
you
describe
for
this
defendant
what
that
better
deal
would
be?
unknown
speaker
but
how
could...
could
he
escape
from
the
mandatory
minimum
in
any
way
other
than
what
they
thought
might
work
here,
this
so-called
safety
valve?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
what
he
got,
and
that's
why
i
can't
understand
any
better
deal
that
this
defendant
might
have
received.
unknown
speaker
you'd
do
it
all
over
again
with
the
same
bottom
line,
but
he's
going
to
feel
better
about
it
the
second
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
that
i
asked
mr.
himmelfarb
and
that
it
seemed
puzzling
to
me
that
the
safety
valve
which
everyone
hoped
would
allow
a
sentence
below
the
mandatory
minimum
could
never
work
from
day
one
because
he
had
two
additional
prior
offenses.
now,
if
anyone
knew
about
those
priors,
which
were
under
a
different
name,
which
is
why
they
weren't
found
immediately,
certainly
the
defendant
knew.
unknown
speaker
so
his...
his
attorney
knew
that
he
was
disqualified
for
this
plea?
unknown
speaker
that
they
were
confirmed,
but
at
what--
unknown
speaker
--at
what
point
in
time?
unknown
speaker
which
we
don't
have
or
do
we
have
it?
unknown
speaker
and
could...
could
you
point
to
that
place
where
it
says
that
before
he
made
this
deal,
which
invoked
the
safety
valve,
he
had
told
his
counsel
that
i
have
three--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
where
he
said,
i
told
my
lawyer
that
i
had
three
prior
convictions.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
all
right.
i
don't
want
to
intrude
on...
on
your
time.
unknown
speaker
and
the
trial
judge
told
him,
you
know,
if
you
don't
qualify,
i
might
give
you
10
years.
do
you
understand
that?
and
he
says,
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
he
says,
knowing
you
have
a
mandatory
minimum,
i
have
to
give
you
10
years.
do
you
still
want
to
go
forward
with
your
plea?
he
says,
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
pretty
hard
to
argue
that...
i
mean...
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
how
could
he
have
had
that
when
the
thing
in
the
plea
agreement
itself
was
explained
to
him
in
spanish
saying
that
he
couldn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
was
an
interpreter
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
interpreter
can
presumably
speak
english.
unknown
speaker
this
is
new
to
me.
i...
i
didn't
see
any...
any
indication
in
your
briefs
or
in
the
record
that
he
claims
he
was
never
told
by
the
interpreter.
i
thought
it
was...
i
thought
it
was
common
ground
that
the
interpreter
had
correctly
explained
the
written
plea
agreement
to
him.
you're
now
saying
that
he
contends
that
he
was
deceived
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
plea
agreement?
unknown
speaker
because?
because
the
plea
agreement
was
read
to
him
in
spanish.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
the
plea...
so
he
hears
in
spanish
someone
read
to
him
the
words,
you
cannot
withdraw
your
plea
agreement...
cannot
withdraw
if
they
don't
accept
it.
and
that's
conceded
in
this
case.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
okay.
then
afterwards
the
judge
tells
him,
in
addition,
if...
has
anyone
explained
to
you
that...
do
you
understand
that
if
you...
that
if
you
don't
qualify
for
the
safety
valve,
you
go
for
10
years.
yes.
has
anyone
promised
you
you
will
qualify
for
the
safety
valve?
no.
so
you
realize
you
could
get
10
years.
all
right?
knowing
that,
you
still
want
to
go
ahead
with
your
guilty
plea?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
one...
one
of
your
points
was
that
this
was
a
rather
long
agreement
and
this
was
paragraph
19.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
didn't
know
that
you
were
claiming
that
this
hadn't
been
an
accurate
translation.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your...
your
point
was
that
it
was
a
lot
to
absorb
without
having
a
written
copy
to
follow.
unknown
speaker
did
you
claim
that
before
the
ninth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
did
the
ninth...
did
the
opinion
reflect
that
at
all
in
the
ninth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
you
said
that
it
was
a
not
a
correct
translation?
unknown
speaker
did
it
or
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
whereabouts?
unknown
speaker
yes,
please
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
finish.
go
ahead.
finish
the
rest
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
yes,
please.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
mossman.
mr.
himmelfarb,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
have
a
question.
i...
i
think
that
her
strongest
point
there
is
that
he
said
in
the
later
sentencing
hearing
that
he
told
his
lawyer
about
the
priors.
now,
if
that's
true,
the
lawyer
would
have
known
immediately
he
couldn't
qualify
for
the
safety
valve
and
would
have
told
him
this
whole
agreement
is
a
joke
because
the
judge
doesn't
have
the
power
to
give
you
anything
less
than
10
years.
so
if...
if
that's
true,
she
must
have
some
kind
of
a
claim.
unknown
speaker
an
ineffective
assistance
claim.
