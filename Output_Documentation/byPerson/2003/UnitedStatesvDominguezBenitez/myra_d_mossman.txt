ms.
myra
d
mossman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
three
points
to
make.
first,
olano
created
a
framework
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
consistently
applying...
applying
in
evaluating
forfeited
errors
in
a
rule
11
context
for
11
years.
second,
now
having
suffered
an
adverse
ruling
in
a
fact-specific
case,
the
government
is
urging
this
court
to
adopt
a
strict,
heavy
burden,
bright
line,
but-for
prejudice
test
in
every
case
that
eliminates
the
lower
court's
flexibility.
third,
not
only
is
the
government's
test
incorrect,
but
the
ninth
circuit
cited
and
applied
olano
and
was
consistent
with
olano
in
benitez.
now,
first,
the
olano
standard
is
a
national
standard
under
plain
error
review
where
an
error
affects
the
substantial
rights.
and
that
means...
generally
is
taken
to
mean
it's
prejudiced.
and
in
most
cases
prejudice
means
that
it
affects
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings.
in
benitez,
this
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
as
well
because
in
benitez,
if
it's
not
minor
or
technical,
that
means
it's
prejudicial.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
or
consistently
can
be--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--they
don't
talk
about
substantial--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--yes,
but
if--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--well,
it's...
we...
we
see
that
not
minor
or
technical
means
it
has...
it
affected
his
substantial
rights,
and
they
actually
cite
to
olano.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
correct,
and--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--correct.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
no,
they...
then--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--well,
they
do
go
to
fourth
prong.
they--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--correct.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
well,
i
think--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--but--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--that
is
the
obvious
case,
justice
breyer,
and
that
was
chan
and
they
cite
to
that
in
benitez
where
they
got
exactly
the
sentence
that
they
bargained
for.
therefore,
the
error
is
not
minor
or
technical.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
well,
i
think
what's
coupled
here
is
that
it
has
to
be
knowing.
there
has
to
be
a
knowingness
and
a
voluntariness.
and
in
that
situation,
if
the...
if
the
defendant
knew
that
he
was
possibly...
that
the
sentence
that
he
bargained
for
was--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--we
believe
that
is
consistent.
he...
he
got
what
he...
if
the
sentence
is
less
than
he...
or
got
the
sentence
that
he
bargained
for,
where
is
the
error?
ms.
myra
d
mossman
but
the--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--because
we're--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--so
if
the--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--justice
breyer,
if
they...
if
it's
a
major
rule
11
error,
it
would
not
be
minor
or
technical.
the
analysis
would...
would
address
that
fact.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
we
don't
believe
all
errors
in
rule
11--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--well,
we
think...
congress
has
enacted
this
and
the
full
panoply
of
errors--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--of
rule
11
advisements
are
important,
and
none
them
can
be
considered
minor
or
technical--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--in
and
of
themselves.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
it's
part
of
the
analysis.
i
think
you
have
to
complete
the
analysis.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
well,
i
think
that
was
brought
out
in
actually
the
advisory
committee
notes.
so,
for
instance,
if
the...
if
the
judge
failed
to
advise
the
defendant
that
if
he
lies
on
the
stand,
he'd
be
subjected
to
perjury
charges.
that's
considered
not
a
minor
or...
that's
considered
basically
a
minor
or
technical
advisement.
also,
if
there
was...
the
judge
failed
to
cite
to
an
elements
of
the
offense,
but
the
defendant
demonstrated
that
he
specifically
knew
about
that,
that
would
not
be
considered
minor
or
technical.
if
the
judge
misstates
a...
the
maximum
sentence,
but
the
defendant
receives
a
sentence
that's
substantially
lower,
that
was
considered
under
the
advisory
committee
notes
basically--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--they
were
just
giving...
it
was
illustrative
i
believe.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
it's
our
position
that
i
wouldn't
be
here
if
he
didn't
want
his
plea
vacated.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
well,
we--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--justice
ginsburg,
it's
our
position
that
this
particular
defendant
at
every
single
proceeding,
he...
he
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
with
his
counsel,
and
the
respondent's
second
letter
to
the
court,
which
is
at
the
joint
appendix,
number
96,
was
exactly...
could
be
construed,
because
it
was
a
pro
se
filing,
as
a
motion
to
withdraw.
he
asked
for
new
counsel
to
look
at
his
case
anew.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
justice
ginsburg,
after
the
conference
on
the
substitution
of
hearing,
a
sentencing
date
was...
was
set,
and
this
particular
defendant
did
not
object
to
the...
to
a
trial
date...
excuse
me...
a
trial
date
was
set,
and
this
particular
defendant
did
not
object.
his
attorney
made
some
comments
about
maybe
it's
not
necessary.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
his
first
statement
to
the
court
at
that
substitution
of...
of
counsel
hearing
was
at
no
time
have
i
decided
to
go
to
trial.
but
that's
not
conclusive.
he
needed
more--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--he
never
said
that
specifically
or
definitively.
he
said
at
no
time
have
i
decided
not--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--this
particular
defendant
made
requests
of
his
attorney
that
were
not
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
he
acted
pro
se
in...
in
three
instances.
we...
the
record
is
actually
void
to
know
if
he...
and
he
was
actually
silenced
when
he
wanted
to
ask
this...
the
judge
questions
at
his
change
of
plea
hearing.
he
said
i
was
asked...
i
wanted
to
ask
the
judge
questions
and
i
was
silenced.
so
the
record
is
actually
void
specifically
to
answer
your
question.
we
don't--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--basically
his
own
confession
and
two
co-defendants.
he
was
caught
by...
basically
the
deal
went
down
through
a
confidential
informant.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
in
our
opening
brief--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--in
our
opening
brief,
we
completely
briefed
out
the
defense
of
entrapment,
and
this
is
brought
out
through
the...
the
language
of
this
defendant
through
the
three
letters
that
were
submitted
to
the
court
through
his
own
pro
se
actions.
we
believe
that
he
had
a
possible
defense
of
entrapment.
i
was
not
his
trial
attorney.
so--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--yes.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
no,
they
were
not.
no,
they...
they
were
not,
justice
scalia.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
i
don't
think
that
would
be
fair.
he
has
a
fundamental
right
to
go
to
trial.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
also,
the--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--it's
possible,
but...
it's
possible,
your...
justice
kennedy.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
there
possibly
is.
i
mean,
i...
he
would
not
get
the
acceptance
of
responsibility
points,
but
that...
but
the
acceptance
of
responsibility
points
doesn't
make
the...
the
bottom
line
here
because
of
the
mandatory
minimum.
so
he
still
would
be
looking
at
a
10-year
mandatory
minimum,
even
if
he
went
to
trial,
and
often
defendants
that
go
to
trial
on
these
drug
convictions
do
get
the
mandatory
minimum,
irregardless
if
they
have
gone
to
trial
or...
and
even
irregardless
if
they
don't
get
the
acceptance
of
responsibility
points.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
well,
defendants
plead
guilty
for
all
types
of
reasons.
we
don't
know
what's
in
the
mind
of
defendants.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
well--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--i
think
it's
important
to
see
if
the...
this
implicates
the
constitutional
principles
under
the
due
process
clause.
it
has
to
be
a
knowing
and
voluntary
plea.
that
is
a
subjective
test.
that's
sort
of
built
into
the
rule
11--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--excuse
me,
chief...
mr.
chief
justice.
they
did
under
the
fourth
prong
of
olano.
they...
the
actual
citation
would
have
been
he
did
not
understand
the...
the
consequences
of
his
plea,
which
is
therefore
not
voluntary.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
they
cited
to
graibe.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes,
your
honor.
they
cited
to
graibe
with
cites
to
the
constitution.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
i
think,
justice
breyer--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--yes.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
if
he...
is
he
alleging
a
rule
11
violation?
ms.
myra
d
mossman
justice
breyer,
this
is...
i
believe
you're
talking
about
a
motivated
pleader,
a
pleader
that
was--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--this
case.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
i...
justice,
if
i
can
answer
your
question,
it's
the...
a
defendant
that's
caught
in
the
justice...
a
criminal
justice
labyrinth
and
he...
he
doesn't
understand,
he
doesn't
understand
the
language,
he's
not
confident
in
his
counsel,
and
he
believes
he
can
withdraw
his
plea.
is
that
correct?
ms.
myra
d
mossman
but
he...
he
should--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--well,
justice
breyer,
if
he
was
motivated
to
plead
guilty
and
there
was
an
error
in
the
rule
11
colloquy
and
he
had
the
opportunity
to
replead,
he
could
replead
to
another
type
of
plea
agreement,
a
c
plea
agreement.
he
could
ask
for
different
provisions
within
that...
that
plea
agreement,
for
instance,
less
supervised
release.
he
could
ask
for
a
type
c
plea
agreement.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
well,
he
would...
if
he's
motivated
to
plea--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--justice
scalia,
i
believe
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
renegotiate
or
he
could
be
repleading
to
the...
and
have
confidence
in
the
process.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
justice
ginsburg,
it
possibly
could
be
less
time
on
supervised
release,
less
time...
or...
or
actually
a
type
c
plea
agreement
instead
of
the
type
plea
agreement.
you're
correct
in
saying
they
might
not
offer
him
that
type,
but
95
percent
of
criminal...
federal
criminal
convictions
go
by
way
of
guilty
pleas.
so
they're
going
to
offer
him
something.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
the
mandatory
minimum
just
becomes
the
bottom
line
then.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
well,
justice
ginsburg,
he
could
have
confidence
in
the
plea
proceeding
if
it
was...
if
he
was
given
the
full
panoply
of
his--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--possibly,
yes.
i
mean,
maybe
that
means
something
to
this
motivated
pleader.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
the
defendant
knew,
but
it
was
confirmed
on
the
record
by
the
district
court
judge
that
he
actually
fully
disclosed
to
his
attorney
his
priors.
this
was
brought
out
in
the
record
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
and
the
judge
confirmed
this.
and
so
to
talk
about--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--this...
it
was
confirmed.
the
defendant
said
i
completely
disclosed
everything
to
my
attorney.
i...
i
don't
understand
what's
going
on.
the
points
weren't
explained
to
me.
the
safety
valve
wasn't
explained
to
me.
this
was
brought
out
in
the
sentencing
transcript
that...
that
his
priors
were
confirmed.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
he
exposed--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--he
exposed
his
prior
convictions
to
his
attorney.
this
is
what
brought
this...
mr.
benitez
to
confusion,
and
this
was
articulated
in...
in
the
sentencing
transcript.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes,
you
do.
the
sentencing
transcript
is
at
joint
appendix
104.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
it's
at...
justice
ginsburg,
it's
at
page
109.
if
i
may
read
for
the
court.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
the
defendant:
i
never
felt
that
i
had
the
proper
representation,
the
way
it
should
have
been
in
my
case.
from
the
beginning,
i
never
had
any
knowledge
about
the
points
of
responsibility,
the
safety
valve,
or
anything
like
that.
i
honestly,
from
the
beginning,
i
accepted
through
my...
responsibility
through
my
attorney,
but
he
never
paid
any
attention
to
me,
what
i
had
told
him
about
the
problem
that
i
had.
i
told
him
from
the
beginning
that
i
had
a
problem,
that
i
was
attending
the
program.
and
at
the
end,
he
told
me
that
i...
allegedly
that
i
had
never
told
him,
that
i
had
never
notified
him
of
it.
i
never
hid
anything
in
my
case
about
the
things
that
i
have
done.
everything
i
said...
i
have
said...
everything
i
said...
i
have
said
has
always
been
the
truth
and
the
reasons
why
i
did
it.
and
i
have
always
asked
for
another
chance.
i've
always
asked
him
for
an
opportunity
to
meet
with
the
government
and
he
never
wanted
me
to
do
that.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
he's
trying
to
say,
justice
ginsburg,
that
i
never
hid
anything
and
then...
from
my
attorney
about
this
case.
and
then
the...
the
judge
goes
on
to
question
him.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
it's...
i...
i
think
it's
on
page
110.
so
what
you're...
the
court:
so
what
you're
indicating
you
believe
everyone
knew
about
your
criminal
history.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
the
defendant:
well,
from
the
very
beginning
when
he
went...
when
he
came
to
see
me,
i
explained
it
to
him.
the
court:
i
understand.
so
what
you're
indicating
to
me
is
that
you
believe
from
the
beginning
you
had
disclosed
that
you
had
a
criminal
record.
is
that
right?
the
defendant:
yes.
so
he--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--yes.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes,
correct,
but
this--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--justice
breyer,
but
this
defendant...
it's
not
clear
that
he
did
not
know
that
he
could
not
withdraw
his
plea.
he
was
under
the
impression,
which
is
common
sense
impression,
that
he...
if...
if
he
doesn't
get
the
sentence
that
he...
that
he
asked
for,
he
could
withdraw
his
plea.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
mr.
chief
justice,
our
contention
is
that
the...
the
fact
that
the
plea
agreement
wasn't
in
spanish
is
fatal
here
because
his
attorney
couldn't
speak
spanish.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
but
his...
his
attorney
didn't...
if
his
attorney
couldn't
speak
spanish,
he
doesn't
know
exactly
what
the
interpreter
is
saying.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
the...
well,
there
was
a
contention
here
between
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
in
numerous
instances
before
the
court.
he
expressed
to
the
court
that
he
couldn't
communicate
with
his
attorney
and
the
prosecution
knew
about
this.
they
also
characterized
the
case
as...
under
paralysis,
and
yet
they
still
gave
this
defendant--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--no,
justice
scalia,
we're
not
contending
that,
but
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
plea
agreement
in
and
of
itself
in...
in
this
case
is
not
conclusive
of
understanding.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
that's
part
of
it,
justice
breyer,
yes.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes,
but
also--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--yes,
it...
this
was--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--our...
justice
breyer,
our
position
is
consistent
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
he
was
under
an
expectation,
a
highly...
a
highly...
high
expectation
that
he
would...
would
get
the
safety
valve,
and
like
the
ninth
circuit
said,
he
had
no
incentive
to
read
or
double
check
the
provisions
within
the
plea
agreement
himself.
and
this...
this--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
point.
this
provision
was
buried
in
the
plea
agreement
and
one
doesn't
know,
because
his
counsel
couldn't...
doesn't
speak
spanish.
if
he...
if
the...
if
the
interpreter
inadvertently
misstated
that
provision--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--we--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--in
our...
justice
ginsburg,
in
our
opposition
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
we...
we
claimed
that
that
point,
that...
that
we
have
no
certainty
because
there
was
not
a
transcript
of
the
spanish
interpretation.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
yes.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
they...
yes--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--yes.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
i
can
read...
excuse
me,
if
i
may
correct
myself,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
myra
d
mossman
they
didn't
say
that
it
was
not
a
correct
translation,
but
they
did
hold
it
as
not
conclusive.
and
they
state
that
in
their
decision
when
they
say
that
mr.--
ms.
myra
d
mossman
--just
move
on?
ms.
myra
d
mossman
okay.
i'd
just
like
to
say
that
the
government's
burden
is...
the
government's
test,
the
prejudice
test,
the
but-for
test,
is
asking
this
defendant
to
go
back
in
time
and
to
prove
a
counter-factual.
it's
not
in
this
record,
that
if
not
for
the
error,
he
would
not
have
pled
guilty.
that's
a
very
heavy
burden
here.
and
we
believe
it
emasculates
the
knowing
requirements
and
makes
awareness
of
the
consequences
of
the
plea
irrelevant.
and
the...
a
defendant,
if
he
does
not
understand
the
scope
of
the
prosecution's
promise,
he
cannot
evaluate
the
risks
inherent
in
the
type
of
plea
agreement
that
he's
signing.
we
think
that's
critical.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
that...
that
the
rule
11(e)(2)
warning
and
the
type
of
plea
agreement
that
this
particular
defendant
entered
into
is
highly
critical
and
affords
a
higher
risk
to
this
defendant
because
it
couldn't
withdraw.
and
it's
counterintuitive
to
enter
into
an
agreement
when
you
understand
that
one
party
could
withdraw,
to
think
that
you
can't.
that's
why
the
congress
has
asked...
has
asked
that
this
warning
be
expressly
made
in
the
rule
11
colloquy,
that
if
we...
if
i...
i...
i'm
not
bound
by
the
recommendation.
the
judge
has
said
i'm
not
bound
by
the
recommendations,
but
you
cannot
withdraw
if
i
do
not
give
you
the
sentence
that
you
bargained
for
because
that's
a
counterintuitive
understanding.
i
believe
justice
scalia
was
getting
at
this
when
he
talked
to
mr.
himmelfarb.
and
in
closing,
i'd
just
like
to
say
this
court
should
adhere
to
the
olano
prejudice
test
and
reject
the
government's
invitation
to
adopt
a
but-for,
highly
prejudiced,
highly
burden...
excuse
me...
strict
bright
line
ruling
test.
and
this
court
should
affirm
the
ninth
circuit's
result,
but
if
they
do
not--
