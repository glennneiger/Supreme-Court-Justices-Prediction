well,
sticking
with
justice
o'connor's
question,
suppose
good-time
credits
were
involved
here,
but
insofar
as
the
prisoner
is
concerned,
it
was
wholly
peripheral,
and
assume
that
the
good-time
credits
would
not
click
into
operation
for
another
20
years.
would
it
make
sense
for
us
to
insist
on
heck
v.
humphrey
in
those
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
it
does...
so
you
think
that
if
good-time
credits
were
unequivocally
involved
here,
that
the
heck
rule
would
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
it
clear
that
the
wrong
of
which
he's
complain...
complains...
is
one
of
the
wrongs
set
forth
in
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
or
is
this...
is
this
some--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
he
has
to
both
exhaust
and
prevail?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
seems
somewhat
inconsistent
with
at
least
the
negative
implication
of
the
federal
statute,
which
says
all
he
has
to
do
is
exhaust.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
heck
v.
humphrey's
gloss,
but
that's
an
additional
requirement.
usually
exhaustion
does
not
require
prevailing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
