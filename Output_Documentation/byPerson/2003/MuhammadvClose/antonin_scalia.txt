justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
thought
your
response
to
that
was
that
provocation
was
no
defense
to
the
charge--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
the
charge
of
insolence.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
is
not
your
position,
and
i
don't
know
that
the
other
side
has
contested
it,
that
provocation
would
not
have
been
a
defense
to
the
charge
of
insolence?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore,
your
provocation
claim
does
not
invalidate
the
insolence
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
seem
unreasonable
to
me.
a
police
officer
who's
charged
with
a
civil
rights
violation
for...
for
whacking
a
demonstrator
cannot
please...
plead
as
a
defense,
i
was
provoked.
doesn't
matter
if
you're
provoked,
you're
not
supposed
to
do...
do
the
act,
and
i
don't
know
why
it
would
be
any
different
with...
with
a
prison
inmate
if...
if
he
was
provoked--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
resist
the
provocation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
so
unreasonable
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
all
of
this
is
relevant
why?
because
of
the
issue
of
whether
he's
lost
any
good-time
credit,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
that
issue
waived
by
the
other
side
and
wasn't...
wasn't
there
a
finding?
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
a
finding
by
a...
by
the
magistrate
that
plaintiff
is
no
longer
in
the
more
restrictive
custody
of
toplock
or
administrative
segregation,
nor
in
the
more
extended
custody
that
would
still
faced
him
had
he
lost
any
good-time
credit,
and
an
issue
was
never
made
by
the
other
side
as
i
understand
it,
nor
before
the
sixth
circuit,
that
he
had
lost
any...
any
good-time
credit.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
waived.
why
should
we
get
into
that
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
especially
having
granted
cert
on
a...
on...
on
a
significant
question,
to
which
that...
that
is...
is
preliminary.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
too
late,
but
too
late.
isn't
that
your
point?
they
dispute
you,
but
too
late.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
she
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
but
did
he
exhaust
administrative
remedies
for
what
he's
complaining
about
here,
which
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
not
the
insolence
conviction,
but
rather
the
sixth...
the
sixth
day
lockdown
or
whatever
he
had
pending
the
hearing
on
the
higher
charge.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
raised
on
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
petition
for
cert?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me?
only
fact
issues
can
be...
legal
issues
can't
be
waived?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
did
not...
did
you
make
the
point
below
that
the
other
side
has
to
lose
because
he
lost
good-time
credit?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
which
we
granted
certiorari.
that's
the
question
we...
whether
a
plaintiff
who
wishes
to
bring
a
1983
suit
challenging
only
the
conditions
rather
than
the
fact
or
duration
of
his
confinement
must
satisfy
heck
v.
humphrey.
now,
that
question
is
not
in
the
case,
if
indeed
the
duration
of
his
confinement
is
what
is
affected.
and
did
you
respond
in
the
brief
in
opposition
by
saying,
actually,
this
question
is
not
even
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is...
is
that
so?
you...
you
think
it,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
you...
you
could
not...
you
could
not
say
that
a
prisoner
has
no
right
to
threaten
a
guard
even
if
he...
even
if
he
claims
to
have
been
provoked
or
has
no
right
to
insolent
behavior
even
if
he
claims
to
have
been
provoked?
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
the
prison
cannot
have
such
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
it...
it
does
not
affect
it
if
he
would
have
been
convicted
anyway,
and
the
contention
of
the
other
side
is
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
offense,
both
the
major
offense,
if
he
had
been
guilty
of
that,
and
the
minor
offense,
regardless
of
whether
there
was
provocation
on
the
part
of
the
guard.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why...
why
do
you...
why
do
you
assert
the
opposite?
justice
antonin
scalia
more
than
the
facts
of
the
case,
we...
the
reason
we...
we...
we
adopted
that
common
law
rule
was
to
prevent
a
collision
between
1983
and
habeas
corpus
law
and
prevent
1983
from
being
used
as
an
end-run
around
habeas
corpus
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
collision
was...
was
in
the
reasoning
of
the
court.
it
isn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how...
how
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
meaning
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
--thus,
only
the
loss
of
good
time
could
have
been
challenged
in
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
conditions
couldn't
have
been
challenged
in
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
distinction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
other
circuits
think
is
crucial?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
was...
was
this
argument
raised
below
that
there's
no
cause
of
action
because
there's
no
assurance
that
he
wouldn't
have
been
kept
for
six
days
anyway,
even
if
it
was
bondable?
you...
you
didn't
defend
on
that
ground,
did
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
we
want
to
get
into
that?
i...
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
essential
to
your
argument,
is
it
not,
that
provocation
would
be
a
defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
provocation
would...
would
not
be
a
defense,
then
even
if
he
establishes
provocation,
for
which
he
can
get
damages,
he
would
not
be
impairing
the
judgment
against
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
usually
does
not
require
prevailing,
but
it
does
require
prevailing
when...
when
your
cause
of
action
is
that...
that
you
have
been
subjected
to
the
law
improperly.
