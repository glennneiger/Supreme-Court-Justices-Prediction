justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
is...
this
is
very
strange
when
we...
when
the
original
idea,
i
thought,
of
heck
was
typing
the
kind
of
claim.
i
think
the
court
said
in
that
case,
this
is
not
a
prison
condition
case
like
my
dietary
law
is
not
observed,
am
i
not
getting
medical
treatment,
but
it...
it
is
like...
there
was
an
analogy
to
malicious
prosecution,
and
here
this
has
the
same
flavor,
that
this
is...
the
complaint
is
that
this
guard
had
it
in
for
me,
and
there
were
trumped
up
charges.
and
the
way
you
get
around...
would
you
say
you're
not
really
attacking
the
insolence,
what
he...
he
was
convicted,
so
you're
only
concerned
with
the
six
days
pre-hearing
detention,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can,
in
all
candor,
chop
up
your
complaint
that
way,
because
if
the
officer
hadn't
been
retaliatory,
the
officer
wouldn't
have
confronted
him
in
the
first
place,
he
wouldn't
have
been
insolent,
and
nothing
would
happen.
so
how
you
can
say
is,
well,
we'll
accept
the
insolence
but
really
we
don't
because
this
is
a
retaliation
and
there
never
would
have
been
any
charge
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
is
the
amended
complaint.
it
was
not
his
original
complaint,
and
one
of
the
many
puzzling
features
in
this
case
is
the
sixth
circuit
is
addressing
the
original
complaint,
where
this
man
says,
i
want
the
whole
thing
expunged,
not
that,
yes,
i
was
insolent,
but
i
wasn't
engaged
in
threatening
behavior.
the
initial
complaint
said,
this
officer
retaliated
against
me,
the
whole
thing
is
no
good,
court,
expunge
the
discipline.
and
it
was
only
in
the
amended
complaint
that
they
came
up
with
this
theory,
oh,
insolence
was
all
right,
and
the
only
thing
that
we're
attacking
is
the
threatening
behavior.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
that
a
rather
significant
difference,
because
that
says
the
whole
thing
is
no
good,
the
insolence
is
no
better
than
the
threatening,
the
whole
thing
is
no
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what...
that
isn't
the
complaint
that
was
before
the
sixth
circuit,
so
at
a
minimum,
shouldn't
we
send
it
back
to
the
sixth
circuit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
say,
look,
you
looked
at
the
wrong
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nonetheless,
they
ruled
on
a
complaint
that
is
not
the
one
he
was
complaining
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--know
what
is
very
strange
about
this
case
is
you've
got
these
two
threshold
requirements.
if
it's
a
habeas
line,
then
you
can't
skirt
exhausting
state
judicial
remedies.
if
it's
a
prison
condition
case,
then
you
have
the
plra,
you
have
to
exhaust
the
internal
remedies.
here,
you
didn't
do
either.
i
mean,
if
you
take
it
on
your
case,
this
is
really
in
the
prison
conditions
line.
you
didn't
even
appeal
internally.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
nonetheless,
you
are
saying
that
this
is
a
case
that
can
go
into
court
under
1983
even
though
there
was...
it's
not
on
the
habeas
side
so
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
the
judicial
remedies.
it's
not
on
the
prison
conditions
side
and
you
don't
have
to...
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
internal
administrative
remedies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
did
he
exhaust?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where?
because
it
seems
to
me
that
he
didn't.
he
didn't
ask
for
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
said...
and
he
said,
indeed,
i'm
not
challenging,
i'm
not
challenging
the
insolence
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
can
you
tell
me
exactly
what
that
was,
because
i
don't
see
how
he...
he
had?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
might
have
said
he
didn't
need
to
exhaust.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
he
had
been
charged
initially
just
with
insolence
instead
of
threatening
behavior,
that
is
bondable,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
would
have
been
bonded,
right?
that's
a
discretionary
determination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
might
have
been
the
very
same
thing.
the
officer
might
have
said,
this
is
a
bad
guy,
don't
let
him
out
until
after
the
hearing.
so,
in
one
case,
he
can't
get
out
because
it's
mandatory
pre-trial
detention.
in
the
other...
so
this
case
is
not
about
he
had
a
right
to
be
free,
or
free
in
the
prison
population
those
six
days,
but
he
could
have
argued
that
he
should
have
been
not
locked
up.
is
that's
what
the...
that's
the
whole
thing
that
this
case
is
about,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he's
suing
for
damages
and
that's
the
only
thing
he's
suing
for,
not
injunctive,
nothing
else.
all
he
wants
is
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
he
wants
money
is
for
the
six
days
that
he
might
have
spent
anyway.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i'm
not
talking
about...
it's
bondable.
there's
nothing
that
shows
that
if
the
charge
had
simply
been
insolence
they
wouldn't
have
held
him
for
the
six
days.
he
wasn't
entitled
not
to
be
held.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
what
you're
not...
this
isn't
an
issue
of
whether
provocation
is
a
defense
to
a
charge
of
insolence.
i
thought
what
you
were
saying
is
that
this
whole
string
never
would
have
happened,
nothing
would
have
happened.
if
he...
if
he
establishes
the
retaliation,
then
none
of
this
would
have
happened,
and
it's
just
one
episode.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
sixth
circuit
was
addressing
a
complaint
that
looked
like
it
was
attacking
the
whole
thing,
because
it
asked
for
expungement
of
the
disciplinary...
of
the
disciplinary
action.
why
didn't
you
call
to
the...
or
whoever
was
representing
michigan
at
that
stage...
call
to
the
attention
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
it
had
addressed
the
wrong
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
have
made
a
motion
to
remand
or
something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
condition--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
mean
by
a
conditions
punishment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
condition
here...
and
one
thing
is
the
abstract
level
on
which
you're
speaking,
the
other
is
concretely
what
this
case
is
about.
this
case
is
about
six
days
spent
in
pre-hearing
detention.
it's
the
only
thing
that
money
is
sought
for.
now,
we're
told
that
insolence
is
bondable,
threatening
behavior
is
not.
does
bondable
mean
it
will
be
bond?
what
is
the
incidence?
what
practically
is
the
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
insolence
is
not
mandatory.
what
is
the
practice
in
the
prison?
is
it
common
to
let
people--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
what
this
case
is
about,
those
six
days
when
he
was
in
administrative
detention.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
do
you
have,
rather
than
being
in
the
general
prison
population,
do
you
have
any
statistical
indication
of...
on
charges
of
insolence,
are
people
more
often
than
not,
or
is
it
rare
that
they
would
be
in
administrative
detention
awaiting
the
hearing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
essentially
making
an
exhaustion
of...
of
state
remedies
then?
it
seems
to
me...
are
you...
you're
not
saying
that
this
person
would
have
no
complaint,
no
federal
complaint,
not
in
habeas,
not
in
1983?
are
you
saying
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--or
are
you
saying
1983
is
premature?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
he
get
the
favorable
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
essentially
he
hasn't
exhausted
his
internal
administrative
remedies,
and
that's
why
the
1983
is
improper?
