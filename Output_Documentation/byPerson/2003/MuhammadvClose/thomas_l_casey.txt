mr.
thomas
l.
casey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
agree
this
is
a
very
confusing
case.
we
believe
there
are
several
reasons
why
summary
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
the
first
is
that
because
mr.
muhammad
did
lose
good-time
credits,
and
because
of
the
nature
of
his
challenge
necessarily
implies
the
invalidity
of
his
misconduct
determination,
we
think
this
case
is
controlled
by
edwards
v.
balisok.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
first
of
all,
we
believe
it's...
it's
a
matter
of
straightforward
statutory...
not
even
interpretation,
just
reading
the
text
of
the
michigan
statutes
on
good
time,
so
it's
not
some
fact
issue
that...
that
can
be
waived.
secondly--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no,
it's
not
a
legal
argument.
this
is
a
straightforward...
a
straightforward
application
of
the
statutory
language
that
says
he
did
lose
good
time.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
in
our
first
motion
for
summary
judgment,
which
was
in
1998,
we
argued
that
heck
and
edwards
controlled
the
case,
that
he
was
in
effect
challenging
his
good...
or
his
misconduct
hearing
determination.
the
magistrate
of
the
district
court
denied
that
motion,
saying
he
is
not
challenging
his
misconduct.
they
agreed
with
his
theory
that
this
was
a
stand-alone
retaliation
case.
so
nobody...
neither
party
nor
the
district
court
nor
the
sixth
circuit
got
into
the
fine
points
of
the
argument
about
whether
this
was
a
duration
case
or
a
conditions
case.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
we
submit
it's...
it's
a
straightforward
matter.
it
appears
that
the
magistrate,
in
his
opinion
or
his
recommendation
denying
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
was
under
the
impression
he
did
not
lose
good
time.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
did
not
argue
it
in
those
terms.
we
argued,
as
i
say,
the
broader
application
of
heck
and
edwards
to
the
effect
that
he
was...
the
nature
of
his
challenge
necessarily
implied
that
his--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
we--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes,
that...
that's
correct.
heck...
the
favorable
termination
requirement
of
heck
only
applies
when
the
nature
of
the
challenge
necessarily
implies--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we
argue
that
they
are
not
separate,
that
the
nature
of
this
challenge
does
in
fact
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
his
misconduct
determination.
what
he's
challenging
in
this
federal
lawsuit
is
retaliatory
disciplinary
action.
that...
that's
the
language
that
he
used
in
his
amended
complaint.
what
he's
saying
is
that
the
guard
acted
with
an
improper
motive
and
that
these
adverse
consequences
flowed
from
that.
the
only
adverse
consequences
that
he's
alleging
are
involved
in
the
misconduct
hearing.
so
we
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
he
was
found
guilty
of
insolence
and
not
threatening
behavior
has
any
bearing
at
all
on
this
question.
it
was
one
incident,
one
charge
that
this
particular
hearing
officer
felt
should
be
reduced
to
a
lower
charge,
but
the
nature
of
his
challenge,
if...
if
mr.
muhammad
is
correct
that
this
guard
acted
unconstitutionally,
there
should
not
have
been
any
misconduct
charges,
should
not
have
been
a
hearing,
should
not
have
been
any
pre-hearing
detention
or
post-hearing
punishment.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
heck
v.
humphrey
analysis
says
that
there
were
certain
claims
that
are
not
cognizable
on
a
money
damage
action
under
1983.
our
argument
is
this
is
such
a
claim.
if
a
punishment
imposed
affects
the
duration
of
confinement,
the
loss
of
good
time,
then
under
edwards
v.
balisok,
termination
requires--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--correct.
that...
that's
his
claim.
our
argument
is
that--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well,
that...
that
implicates
the
element
of
the
common
law
tort
of
malicious
prosecution,
as
discussed
in
heck
and
edwards,
and
those
elements
include
favorable
termination
and
probable
cause.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
if...
if
he's
correct
that
this
retaliation
is
independent
of
the
hearing
process,
that's...
that's
his
argument.
our
argument
is
that
the
only
thing
he's
complaining
about
is
the
retaliatory
action,
and
the
retaliatory
action
was
charging
him
with
misconduct.
he--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--under
sixth
circuit
law,
to
establish
a
claim
for
retaliation,
there
has
to
be
protective
conduct
that
the
inmate
engaged
in
and
there
has
to
be
adverse
action
taken
against
that
plaintiff
that
would
deter
a
person
of
ordinary
firmness
from
continuing
to
engage--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--but
that's--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no,
conduct
of
the
guard.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
if
this
situation
had
proceeded
exactly
as
petitioner
alleges
up
to
the
point
where
they
were
nose
to
nose
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
they
had
both
walked
away,
there
would
be
no
retaliation
claim,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
violation
at
all.
the
only
thing
that
gives
rise
to
a
constitutional
right
is
the
adverse
action
of
charging
him
with
misconduct.
that's
why
we
say
that
this
charge
is
necessarily
implicated
in
the
hearing
process.
it
necessary...
necessarily
implicates
that
his
misconduct
determination
is
invalid.
if
he's
right
that
there
should
have
been
no
charge
at
all,
if
he's
right
on
that,
then
the
heck
v.
humphrey
analysis
doesn't
even
come
into
play.
we
think
he's
wrong
on
that.
the...
the
district
court
felt
he
was
right
on
that
and...
and
ruled
against
us
on
our
heck
v.
humphrey
motion.
the
sixth
circuit
in
effect
said
we
were
right
on
that,
that
the
nature
of
this
challenge
does
implicate
the
hearing
process,
and
under
sixth
circuit
precedent,
they
said,
therefore,
it
falls.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
sixth
circuit
issued
its
order.
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing.
under
the
court
rules,
we're
not
permitted
to
respond
to
that,
but
our
argument
is
that
even
though
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we
could
have,
but
we
did
not.
in
retrospect,
i
wish
many
things
had
been
done
differently
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
it
referred
to
the
original
complaint,
but
the...
the
holding
of
the
sixth
circuit
on
page
106
of
the
joint
appendix,
they
say
in
an
earlier
sixth
circuit
case,
and
they
quote
it,
in
order
to
grant
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
the
release
he...
relief
he
seeks,
we
would
have
to
unwind
the
judgment
of
the
state
agency.
that
is
the
basis
on
which
they
affirmed
the
judgment.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
they...
they
mentioned
the
initial
complaint
and
not
the
amended
complaint.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
but
we
believe
that
the
rationale
that
they
used,
that
his
challenge
did
implicate
the
validity
of
his
misconduct
hearing,
is
correct
on
both
his
original
complaint
and
his
amended
complaint.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
we
believe...
that's
the
question
the
court
granted
cert
on.
if
a
punishment
affects
only
conditions--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's...
that's
correct.
i...
i
agree,
your
honor.
we
argue
that--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--because
as
in
the
edwards
v.
balisok
and...
and
heck
v.
humphrey,
the
proper
method
of
analysis
is
to
look
to
the
most
closely
analogous
common
law
tort,
look
to
traditions
of
common
law,
public
policy
considerations
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
section
1983.
in
heck
v.
humphrey
and
edwards
v.
balisok,
the
court
said,
in
the
prison
context...
prison
disciplinary
context,
the
favorable
termination
requirement
applies.
on
the
facts
of
those
cases,
there
was
good
time
involved,
so
duration--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--again,
on...
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
that's...
that
was
the
situation
presented,
because
in
that
case
there
was
a
collision
between
the
habeas
statutes
and
the
1983--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes,
it
was.
but
additional
reasoning
was
based
on
common
law
traditions
and
we
argue
that
that
same
rationale
applies
even
if
good
time
is
not
involved,
even
if
it's
just
conditions
of
confinement
as
punishment.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no.
if...
if
the
nature
of
the
challenge
does
not
imply
that
the
misconduct
determination
is
invalid,
then
the
heck
v.
humphrey
analysis
doesn't
apply.
it's
not
analogous
to
the
common
law
tort
of
malicious
prosecution.
we
don't
assert
that
the
favorable
termination
requirement
applies
to
all
conditions
cases.
we
say
it
only
applies
when
a
claim
for
money
damages
is
attempted
which...
the
nature
of
which
necessarily
implies
that
the
misconduct
hearing
is
invalid.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
sixth
circuit,
and
all
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions
that
have
attempted
to
apply
the
heck
v.
humphrey
analysis
to
conditions
cases,
are
necessarily
involved
in...
in
extension
of
the
heck
rationale
to
this
other
factual
context,
because
heck
and
edwards
involved
good-time
losses.
i
agree
that's...
we
assume
that's
why
the
court
took
the
case.
when
we
filed
our
brief
in
opposition,
we
suggested
that
there
are
these
alternative
reasons
why
the
court
should
not
grant
cert..
one
of
them
was
the
loss...
that
he
did
in
fact
lose
good
time,
but--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--a...
a
claim
for
damages
cannot
go
forward
unless
there's
favorable
termination.
if
his
claim
was
for
an
injunction
changing
the
hearing
procedures
somehow,
as
in
edwards,
that
type
of
claim
could
go
forward.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
way
the
sixth
circuit
is
different
from
most
of
the
other
circuits
is
that
they
apply
the
heck
v.
humphrey
analysis
to
punishments
of
conditions
and
not
just
to
punishments
affecting
the
duration
of
confinement.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
sixth
circuit
applies
it
to
conditions,
punishments,
and
duration
punishments.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the...
the
punishments
that
mr.
muhammad
received
were
the
loss
of
good
time,
confinement
to
administrative
segregation,
essentially
remaining
in
his
cell,
plus
loss
of
privileges
for
30
days.
so
only
the
loss
of
good
time
affects
the
duration
of
his
sentence--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
distinction
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--correct.
in...
in
conditions
challenges,
habeas
corpus
relief
is
not
available,
so
there
will
be
no
other
federal
court
remedy
if
a
federal
civil
rights
action
is
not
available.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
it's
our
position
that
if
he
is--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--prisoners
who
seek
to
challenge
the
nature
of
their
complaint
seeks
to
challenge
or
call
into...
whose
challenges
necessarily
imply
that
a
prison
misconduct
is
invalid,
do
not
have
a
federal
civil
rights
act
case
of
action,
whether
it...
whether
the
punishment--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
and
the
difference
was
created
because
the
majority
in
heck
based
much
of
its
decision
on
a
rationale
of
the
common
law.
a
concurring
opinion
in
that
case,
signed
by
four
justices,
said,
no,
we're
not
going
to
base
it
on
that
rationale
because
that
might
mean
that
there
would
be
no
civil
rights
act
remedy
in
any
such
case.
subsequently,
in
the
spencer
v.
kemna,
one
of
the
judges
who...
or
justices...
who
had
been
in
the
majority
changed
her
mind
and
is
now
agreeing
with
the
rationale
of
the
concurring
opinion
in
heck.
so
that's
why
the
sixth
circuit,
or
that's
why
the
courts
of
appeals
are
split
on
this.
on
the
facts
of
edwards
and
heck
it
involved
just
duration
claims,
but
depending
on
the
rationale
for
the
rule,
it
may
or
may
not
apply
to
conditions
cases.
we
say
it
does
apply
to
conditions
cases
because--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--some...
some
major
misconducts
are
mandatory
non-bondable.
threatening
behavior,
the
original
charge,
was
mandatory--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--on...
on
page
14
of
the
joint
appendix
we've
quoted
from
the
policy
directive,
and
the
standard
is,
if
there
is
a
reasonable
showing
that
failure
to
do
so
would
constitute
a
threat
to
the
security
or
good
order
of
the
facility,
so
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
a
prisoner
charged
with
a
bondable
major
misconduct
could
be
placed
in
pre-hearing
detention.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no,
no.
that...
that's
the
phrase
used
in
these
prison
directives.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
those
are
the
six
days
for
which
he
is
seeking
damages.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i...
i
don't
have
the
statistics
of...
the
department
of
corrections
probably
could
compile
that,
but
i
don't
know.
i
do
know
that
there
were
last
year
more
than
72,000
major
misconduct
hearing
of
all
kinds,
bondable
and
non-bondable.
i
do
not
know
how
many
of
those
72,000
resulted
in
pre-hearing
detention.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
it
was
not
argued
in
those
terms,
no.
as
i
said,
the
case
was
argued--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no.
we
did
not
argue
the...
the
terms
of
the
bond
versus
non-bondable,
because
it
simply
didn't
come
up.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
our
response
to
that
in...
in...
in
response
to
the
question
that
the
court
granted
certiorari
on
is
that
even
if
good
time
was
not
at
issue
in
the
case,
if
the
only
punishment
he
received
affected
the
conditions
of
confinement,
our
argument
is,
it's
still
appropriate
to
look
to
the
traditions
of
the
common
law
and
public
policy
considerations
to
determine
whether
a
cause
of
action
in
those
circumstances
is
cognizable
in
1983.
we've
argued
that
it
is
not
cognizable.
if
he
is
challenging
the
validity
of
his
misconduct
determination,
that's
analogous
to
the
common
law
tort
of
malicious
prosecution.
the
elements
of
that
tort
require
favorable
termination
before
it
can
succeed.
we
believe
that...
that
same
element
applies
in
a
1983
case.
so
if
he
does
not
get
favorable
termination
of
his
prison
misconduct,
he
cannot
bring
a
suit
for
damages
under
1983.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
whatever...
whatever
charge--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--one
of
the
elements
of
the
constitutional
cause
of
action
for
retaliation
is
adverse
action
against
the
prisoner
because
of
his
protective
conduct.
the
adverse
action
in
this
case
is
not
the
staring
down
and
the
nose-to-nose
confrontation.
the
adverse
action
is
charging
misconduct,
and
we
say,
if
he's
right
in
his
complaint
that
there
would
not
have
been
a
misconduct
charge
but
for
this
action,
that
necessarily
implies
that
the
misconduct
proceeding
is
invalid,
and
that
triggers
the
analogy
to
malicious
prosecution
and
its
element
of
favorable
termination.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
you
say
the
same
methodology
applies
whether
it's
just
conditions
or
duration
of
confinement.
if
it's
a--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
if
he
gets
favorable
termination.
we
say--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the...
if
he
got
favorable
termination
by
review
of
the
misconduct...
if
he...
if
he
had
won
at
the
misconduct
or
if
he
had
appealed
and
won
on
appeal,
that
would
be
favorable
termination.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
say
the...
his
failure
to
exhaust
is
another
independent
reason
why
he
does
not
have--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct.
they're
independent
requirements.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
the...
the
court
addressed
that
question
in
heck
v.
humphrey,
and
it
said
that
even
if
a
person
exhausts
his
remedies,
if
he
has
not
favorably
terminated,
he
cannot
bring
the
lawsuit
unless
and
until
he
gets
favorable
termination.
they're...
they're
independent.
the
exhaustion
requirement--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
the...
the
reason
he
has
to
get
favorable
termination
in
this
case
is
because
of
the
analogy
to--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--malicious
prosecution.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
that's
our
argument.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
thank
you
very
much.
