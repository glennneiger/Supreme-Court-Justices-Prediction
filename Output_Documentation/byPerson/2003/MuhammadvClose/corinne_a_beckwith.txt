ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
shakur
muhammad,
is
a
state
prisoner
who
has
brought
a
civil
rights
action
alleging
that
a
prison
guard
framed
him
on
a
false
disciplinary
charge
in
retaliation
for
his
having
exercised
his
constitutional
right
to
seek
redress
in
the
courts
for
this
same
prison
guard's
previous
misconduct.
for
three
reasons,
this
court
should
not
graft
onto
this
type
of
section
1983
claim
a
favorable
termination
requirement
that
would
make
this
prisoner
have
to
win
his
claim
in
another
forum
before
he
can
seek
his
remedy
in
federal
court.
first,
the
favorable
termination
requirement
is
a
habeas
protecting
advice...
device...
that
was
borne
of
this
court's
recognition
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
a
general
civil
rights
action
to
be
the
vehicle
for
undoing
a
state
criminal
judgment,
particularly
given
the
more
specific
habeas
exhaustion
requirement.
second,
extending
the
favorable
termination
requirement
beyond
this
original
rationale
lacks
any
basis
in
the
statute's
terms
or
history,
and
it's
devoid
of
the
kind
of
common
law
pedigree
that
might
suggest
congress
envisioned
a
broader
application
to
cases
that
do
not
look
like
habeas
cases
in
that
they
don't
involve
a
direct
or
an
indirect
challenge
to
the
fact
or
duration
of
custody.
and
finally,
any
remaining
qualms
about
congress'
intent
are
resolved
by
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
where,
after
carefully
weighing
the
interests
of
overburdened
courts
and
of
prison
officials,
congress
imposed
an
administrative
exhaustion
requirement,
not
a
favorable
termination
requirement.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
well,
that's
right,
and
you
know,
this
is
undoubtedly
a
valid
first
amendment
retaliation
claim.
the
idea
here
is
our...
our
client
is
saying,
you
know,
he...
he
made
perfectly
appropriate
allegations
in
the
courts
against
this
prison...
this
prison
guard
in
prior
lawsuits,
and
the
guard
set
out
to
get
him--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--it's
not...
i
don't
believe
it's
an--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--i
don't
think
so,
because
it's
not
an
unexhausted
claim,
and
i
believe
the
whole
point
of
this
case
is
the...
is
the
misstatement
of
the
law
by
the
sixth
circuit
that
would
deem
this
a
non-civil
rights
claim,
basically
a
habeas
claim
completely
contrary
to
this
court's
precedent
in
preiser.
we
have,
you
know,
preiser
v.
rodriguez,
which
set
up
the
way,
you
know,
followed
up
on
by
heck
v.
humphrey,
the
way
that
we
decide
which
way
these
cases
should
go.
is
this
a
civil
rights
claim?
it
should
go
through
1983.
or
is
it
something
we're
worried
might
swallow
the
habeas
exhaustion
requirement?
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
the...
whether
good-time
credits
are
lost
is
a...
is
a
consideration
and
whether
there
is
a
fact
or
duration
case.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
and
this
case
is
nothing
about--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--i
think
we
do.
the
most
important
point
on
that
question,
justice
o'connor,
is
something
that
i...
a
point
i
unfortunately
made
in
a
footnote
instead
of
in
the
text,
footnote
6
on
page
5
of
the
yellow
brief,
which
i
wish
had
been
the
first
sentence
of
my
issue
in
bold,
and
that
point
is
that
it
doesn't
matter,
because
we're
not...
no
part
of
our
constitutional
claim
challenges
the
insolence
conviction.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
it...
that's
right.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
that's
right,
but
there's
nothing
about
this
claim
that
would
ever,
you
know,
ever
lead
to
the
result,
under
the
test
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
deprivation
of
good-time
credits,
which,
by
the
way,
i
don't
believe
we
were
deprived
of
good-time
credits,
because
of
the
reasons
i
state
in
my
brief.
our
client
is
a
habitual
offender
and
this
claim
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
court
but--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--that...
that
is
true.
i
don't
believe
that
would
ever--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--i
don't
think
so.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
sure.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
i
don't
think
that...
i
think
that
that
aspect
of
the
claim,
you
know,
aside
from
waiver
and
aside
from
not
challenging
the
conviction
that
led
to
the
good-time
credits,
if
they
exist,
is
still
not
true,
i
don't
think.
it...
it's
too
hypothetical.
most
of
these
cases
are
like
preiser,
where
there
would
be
immediate
release.
he
has
to
serve
his
minimum
sentence
under
michigan
law,
so
he's
not
ever
going
to
get
out
earlier
than
his
minimum.
he...
those
will
not
be
shortened
by
good-time
credits.
after
that,
he's
going
to
see
the
parole
board
several
times.
he's
going
to
be
103
years
old
when
he
hits
his
maximum
sentence.
the
likelihood
that
he
would
actually
not
be
dismissed
until
his
maximum
sentence,
you
know,
be
discharged
as
opposed
to
paroled
earlier
than
that
and
have
his
sentence
terminated
long
before
his
maximum,
you
know,
just
makes
it
impossible
that
this
would
be
anything
but
hypothetical--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--well,
that
may
be
true
in
another
case,
but
it's
not
true
in
our
case,
because
we're
not
challenging,
you
know,
nothing
about
our
constitutional
claim
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
that
insolence
conviction.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
in...
i
mean,
i
think
that...
that
preiser
created
a
clean
line,
and
this
court
has
decided
repeatedly
that
good-time...
the
loss
of
good-time
credits
falls
on
the
fact
or
duration
side
of
that
line,
and
i
think
it
makes
sense
to
continue
to
maintain
that
clean
line,
and
it's
the
kind
of
thing
where
good-time
credits
are
the
hard
case.
there's--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--i
don't...
i...
i
think
that's
what
this
court's
precedents
would
suggest.
there
might
be
room
for
reconsideration
of
the
good-time
credits
in
the
future
when
it...
when
it
starts
to
get
real
hypothetical
or
when
there...
if
there
might
be
some
abuses,
such
as
prison,
you
know,
evidence
that
prisons
were,
you
know,
had
the
perverse
incentive
of
tacking
on
good-time
credits
to--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--well,
i...
that's...
part...
along
the
lines
of
the
argument
the
respondent
makes
in
trying
to
use
a...
sort
of
a
but-for
kind
of
take,
or
test,
or
a
relevance
kind
of
test,
but
that
is
not
the
test.
the
test
is
whether
the
claim,
the
constitutional
claim,
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
or
sentence--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--that's
right.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
the
respondent
is...
is
arguing
that...
that
it
goes
to
credibility.
credibility
is
not
enough.
that's
about
relevance
or
admissibility.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
that's
right.
there's
no--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--there's...
there's...
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
there's
no
way
of
litigating--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--well--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--and
it
is.
i
have
several
answer
that.
it
is
totally
separate.
you...
you
can't
litigate
the
retaliation
claim
in...
in
a...
in
a
prison
misconduct
hearing,
just
as
rodney
king
couldn't--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--in
fact,
we
actually...
the
hearing
officer
himself,
in
his
deposition,
which
is
at
joint
appendix
102
to
103,
indicates
he...
he...
retaliation
was
not
a
defense.
it
might
go
to
credibility,
but
he
can't
consider
that--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--it's--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
just
assumed
it
as...
as
a
logical
matter.
it's
like,
as
i
was
saying
before,
rodney--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--right.
it's
just
like
assault
on
a
police
officer.
if
you're
arrested
because
you're
black
and
then
you
assault
that
police
officer,
you...
you
know,
your...
your
1983
claim
on
the
illegal
arrest
is
not,
you
know,
it's...
it's
separate
and
apart
from--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--the...
the
hearing
officer
himself
said
that--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
and
i'm
sorry
that
i--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--and
in
any
event--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--i
think
that
what...
whether
we
challenge
the...
the
misconduct...
the
result
of
the
misconduct
proceeding
in
this
case
is
really
not
relevant
because--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--the...
the
complaint
is
very
clear.
i
mean,
the
gist...
the
most
tangible
part
of...
of
the
complaint
is
that
i
was
overcharged,
you
know,
and
i
had
to
do
pre-hearing
detention,
six
days
in
pre-hearing
detention
that
i
would
not
otherwise
have
had
to
do
because
this
guard
was
retaliating
against
me
for
suing
him,
for
exercising--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--well,
the
two
complaints
are
actually
very
similar,
maybe
identical,
except
for
the...
removing
the
request
for
expungement.
and,
of
course,
the
sixth
circuit's--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--mr.
muhammad
was...
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
he
was...
he
was
working
pro
se,
and
he
amended
his
complaint.
the
amended
complaint
was
accepted
and
that's...
that's
the
complaint
that's...
that's
before--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--no.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
well,
it
was
the
complaint
that
was
before
the
sixth
circuit.
they
just
made
a
factual
error,
and
i
think
both
parties
agree
it
was
a
factual
error,
but
it's
one
that
didn't
matter.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
but...
but
it
doesn't
matter,
because
they
relied
on
huey
v.
stine
and
the
case
law
in
the
sixth
circuit.
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
you
asked
for
expungement
or
not
if
you
are
challenging
the
result,
which
the
sixth
circuit
thought--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--i
don't--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--that's
absolutely
right.
the
issue
wasn't
presented--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--right.
and
if...
but
if--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
if
good-time
credits
are
not
at
issue,
it
doesn't
matter
if
we're
challenging
the
insolence
conviction,
because
nothing
about
this
claim
is
going
to
affect
the
fact
or
duration
of...
of
confinement,
so
that,
you
know--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--the
state
does
dispute.
you
know,
i
think
they're
wrong
for
four
reasons.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
that
is
my
point.
i
mean,
that
is
my
best
point.
my
second
best
point--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--well--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--that's
right.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
i
agree.
it's
an
issue
because
the
respondent
is
trying
to
push
the
test
of,
you
know,
of
heck
v.
humphrey
into
the
context
of
misconduct
proceedings,
regardless
of
the
punishment
imposed.
they
say
even--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--no.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
as
in
edwards,
it
should
definitely
apply
when
good-time
credits
are
lost
or
something
else
happens,
you
know,
in
the
proceeding.
i
can't
imagine
what
besides
good-time
credits,
but
if
fact
or
duration
is
affected...
in
this
case,
fact
or
duration
was
not
affected.
this
is
a
classic
civil
rights
claim.
we're
talking
about
the
first
amendment.
it
could
have
been
about
religion.
it
could
have
been
about
race.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
but
that's...
that's
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the...
the
respondent
complained
in
the
courts
below
about
exhaustion.
it
was
considered
by
the
lower
court.
the
respondent
said,
you
didn't
seek
rehearing,
and
the
magistrate
judge
said,
i
disagree
with
you,
he
didn't
have
to
seek
rehearing
because
he's
not
complaining
about
the
insolence--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--justice
ginsburg,
i
absolutely
disagree.
he
did
exhaust.
this
was
a
question--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--he...
he
did
everything
he
needed
to
do.
the
magistrate
judge
held
that
and
the
district
judge
affirmed
that
and
it
wasn't
appealed--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--in--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--record
68,
the
district
court
record
in
68,
unfortunately
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix
at...
at
8
to
9...
pages
8
to
9,
the
magistrate
held
that
mr.
muhammad
exhausted,
without
seeking
rehearing
he
exhausted.
and
there
was
also
a--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--well,
the--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--no,
the...
the...
the
government
filed
a
brief,
a
motion
to
dismiss,
saying,
you
know,
many
things,
but
one
of
the
things
was
he
didn't
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
and
they
said
because
he
didn't
seek
rehearing,
respondent,
or
the...
mr.
muhammad
responded,
i
didn't
have
to
seek
rehearing
because
i'm
not
complaining
about
the
insolence.
i
agree
i'm
guilty
of
insolence.
and
the
magistrate
agreed.
that's
the
end
of
exhaustion.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
right.
there
was
no--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--as
far
as
we
know,
he
exhausted
everything
that
he
needed
to
exhaust.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
the
government--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--i--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--i
understand.
there...
there's
no
doubt
that
the
plra
requires
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
it's
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
it's
not
jurisdictional.
every
circuit
court
to
consider
the
issue
has
said
it's
not
jurisdictional.
the
government
raised
the...
the
question.
the
lower
court
considered
it.
they...
they
ruled
in
our
favor.
it's
not
a
part
of
this
case
anymore.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
it
was
not
raised
on
appeal.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
in...
in
cert?
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
no.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
that's
right,
but
it
was
not
part
of...
of
the
government's
response,
failure
to
exhaust.
it
was
decided
in
the
lower
court.
it's...
it's
over.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
yes.
and
in
fact,
that...
that's
one
of
our
arguments
that
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
reaffirms
the...
the
clean
line
that
was
created
in
preiser.
you
have
fact
or
duration
claims
and
you
have
conditions
claims,
prison
litigation
reform
act,
in...
in
creating
an
exhaust...
an
administrative
exhaustion
requirement
for
conditions
claims,
you
know,
indicates
that
this
is
the
kind
of
claim
that
needs
to
exhaust.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
that's
right.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
i
mean,
his...
his
claim
is
a
first
amendment
retaliation
claim.
the
damages
are
this,
you
know,
the
chilling
effect,
the
six
days
of
pre-hearing
detention,
but
that's
just
a
remedial
question.
the
claim
is
a
valid
one.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
that's
right.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
he
wouldn't
have
spent
it
anyway,
and
you
can
see
from
the
joint
appendix
at
page
58,
credit
was
not
given--
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
--that's
purely
speculative
and
a
matter
of
remedy,
not...
not
the
right.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
corinne
a.
beckwith
turning
to
the
actual
question
presented
in
this
case,
there
is
no
justification
for
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
extending
the
heck
favorable
termination
requirement
to
prison
hearings
that
don't
involve
the
fact
or
duration
of
custody.
congress
could
have
amended
1983
to
say
that,
but
we
know
from
the
plra
they
looked
at
the
same
considerations,
they
did
something
different.
the
sixth
circuit
is
an
outlier
here,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
because
there's
no...
there's
no
conflict
with
habeas
in
a...
in
a
matter
like
this.
as
to
all
of
the
other
questions
that
have
come
up
during
this
argument,
this
case
came
to
this
court
in
the
posture
where
there
were
no
good-time
credits
and
there
was
no
exhaustion
question.
now,
we
think
we
can
overcome
those
problems,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to.
and
the...
the
government
has
never
cited
any
laws
that
says
the
guard's
retaliatory
conduct
violating
mr.
muhammad's
first
amendment
rights
would
have
been
a
defense,
and
we
know
of
none.
they
argued
that
it
was...
it
was
relevant
to
credibility.
they
argued
that
that
was
some
kind
of
a
but-for
relationship,
but
victory
in
the
1983
suit
does
not
affect
the
adjudication
for
insolence
in
this
claim.
all
of
this
only
matters
if
good-time
credits
are
at
issue.
and
putting
all
of
that
aside,
we
just
agree
with
justice
breyer
that
then
this
is
an
easy
case
in
our
favor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
we'd
ask
that
you
reverse
the
sixth
circuit.
