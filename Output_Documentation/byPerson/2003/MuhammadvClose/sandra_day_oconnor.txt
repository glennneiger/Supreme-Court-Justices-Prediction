justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
heck
humphrey
issue
that
comes
to
us
one
that
is
affected
by
whether
good-time
credits
are
lost?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
after
all
the
briefing,
the
additional
briefing
that's
gone
on,
do
we
know
now
for
sure
whether
good-time
credits
are
affected
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
for
ease
of
judicial
administration,
do
we
really
want
to
have
to
look
at
how
old
he's
going
to
be
and
all
of
these
things?
is
it
not
possible
to
say
at
the
end
of
the
day,
good-time
credits
still
apply
to
the
maximum,
so
you're
out
of
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
aggrieve,
looking
at
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
that
it
was
examining
the
original
complaint,
not
the
amended
complaint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
agreed
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
looking
at
the
initial,
original
complaint,
not
the
amended.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
looked
like
the
sixth
circuit
is
on
the
short
side
of
a
five-to-one
split
among
the
courts
of
appeals
on
how
heck
v.
humphrey
is
to
be
applied,
that
the
sixth
circuit
views
it
differently
than
the
other
circuits
that
have
addressed
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
based
on--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--its
own
huey
decision,
and
i
really
thought
very
likely
that
was
why
this
court
granted
cert
here,
to
see
whether
the
sixth
circuit
rule
is
out
of
step
with
what
we
said
in
heck
v.
humphrey.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
of
course,
that
conceivably
was
waived,
because
you
didn't
get
into
it
below.
if
we...
if
we
disregard
that
and
think
that
you
waived
this
issue
of
good-time
credits,
and
if
we
reach
the
merits
on
which
i
assumed
we
granted
the
case,
then
what
justifies
the
sixth
circuit
rule?
do
you
say
just
because
damages
potentially
are
at
issue
that
the
1983
claim
can't
go
forward?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it...
it's
your
position
that
there
should
be
no
remedy
whatever
for
this
person?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if...
if...
we're
disregarding
the
good-time
credits.
that's
waived,
that's
out
of
here.
let's
just
make
that
assumption.
and
you
say
that
he's
out
of
luck
on
pursuing
any
remedy
for
anything
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
other
circuits
disagree.
they
say
that
in
this
case
it
would
relate
to
conditions,
and
therefore,
the
1983
suit
could
go
forward.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
difference?
