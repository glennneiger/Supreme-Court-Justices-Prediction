justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position...
your
position
as
i
understand
was
that
even
if
he
did
not
lose
any
good-time
credits,
that
you...
nevertheless,
heck
controls.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
that's
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question?
assume
we
had
the
case
with
the
same
facts
except
the
remedy
a
different...
if
the,
say
the
prison
authorities
had
said
you
can't
use
your
television
set
for
30
days
and
that
was
the
only
remedy
and
otherwise
everything
else
was
the
same,
and
he
said
it
was...
they
did
that
in
retaliation
because
i
exercised
my
first
amendment
rights.
if
that
were
the
discipline,
would
heck
v.
humphrey
preclude
relief
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
the
one
we
probably
ought
to
hear
some
argument
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
would
it
preclude
relief
in
that
case?
that's
what
i'd
be
interested
in
hearing.
