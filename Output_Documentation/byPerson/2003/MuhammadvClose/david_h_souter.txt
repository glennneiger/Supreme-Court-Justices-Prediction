justice
david
h.
souter
but
is...
is
that
really
the
point?
it's
not
what
you
challenge,
it's
the
implication
of
what
you
want
to
be
held.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
those
are
quite
different
things.
i
mean,
if
in
fact
good-time
credits
are
lost,
even
though
you
are
not
asking
for
any
adjudication
on
good-time
credits,
then
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
length
of
the
sentence
can
be
affected,
and
it
necessarily
follows
that
at
some
point
there
could
be
a
habeas
claim
because
the
individual
was
not
being
released.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let...
let's...
could
we
just
make
a
short
excursus
there?
assuming
that
no
good-time
credits
are
lost
with
respect
to
the
minimum
sentence,
the
point
of...
determining
the
earliest
point
at
which
he
could
be
paroled,
isn't
it
the
case
under
state
law
that
good-time
credits
still
would
be
applied
to
the
maximum
sentence?
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
isn't
that
the
end
of
your
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
doesn't
it...
i
mean,
let
me
just
finish--
justice
david
h.
souter
--my...
my
question
so
you
know
where
i'm
going.
if...
if...
if
the
good-time
credits
would
apply
to
the
maximum
sentence,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
is
not
released
at
the
point
at
which
he
says
he
should
be
entitled
to
good-time
credits,
he's
got
a
habeas
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
a...
that's
an
issue
of
fact.
and
the
thing
that's
bothering
justice
breyer
is
the
same
thing
that's
bothering
me,
and
that
is
it
seems
a...
it
seems
like
a
very
strange
statement
of
law
to
say
that
there
would
be
no
retaliation
defense,
and
if...
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
say
that
in
order
to
avoid
heck
and
humphrey.
so
what's
your
basis
for
saying
it?
do
you
have--
justice
david
h.
souter
--any
state
law
authority
for
saying
that
so
that
we
could
make
that
assumption
that
you
are
correct
in
your
statement
when
we
decide
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
assumed
that
in...
in
the...
in
the
disciplinary
proceeding
for...
that,
let's
say,
in
a
disciplinary
proceeding
for
insolence,
he
would
not
be...
the
prisoner
would
not
have
the
opportunity
of
saying,
he
got
me
into
this
situation
in
retaliation
for
filing
these
actions?
you
just
assumed
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we're
talking
here
about
insolence.
i
mean,
he
gave
him
a
dirty
look
of
something
or
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
there
any
state
law
authority
that
we
could
look
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
didn't
you
waive
the
question
of
good-time
credits?
i
mean,
why...
you...
you
heard
the
discussion
before.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
is
this
something
we
should
consider?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
isn't
it
waived?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and
let's
assume
the
magistrate
was
wrong.
as
i
understand
it,
you
did
not
go
to
the
district
court
and
say,
the
magistrate
is
wrong
on
this
point
and
this
point
can
be
dispositive
under
heck.
am
i
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
you
say
basically,
the
importance
of
heck
and
humphrey
here
is
the
way
it
says
you
ought
to
refer
to
common
law
analogies
in
analyzing
whether
there
ought
to
be
a
1983
action,
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
in
the
final
analysis
with
whether
there's
a
collision
between
habeas
corpus
and
1983.
that
is
an...
that
is
an
independent
requirement
of
the
way
you
go
about
analyzing
1983
actions.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
even
though
there
isn't
a
habeas
corpus
problem,
you
still
go
through
the
same
methodology?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
