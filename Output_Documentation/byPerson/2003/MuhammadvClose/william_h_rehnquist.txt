ms.
beckwith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
one
of
the
reasons
you
got
into
it
was
that
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
you
had...
had
to
comply
with
heck
against
humphrey,
and
you
didn't
agree
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
though
the
state
does
dispute
you
on
the
good-time
credit,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't...
you
don't
say
that
heck
against
humphrey
should
never
apply
to
misconduct
proceedings,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
just
say
it
shouldn't
have--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
the
state,
from
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
beckwith.
mr.
casey,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
that
even
if
setting
a...
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
would
not
in
any
way
call
into
question
the
prison
disciplinary
proceeding,
it
still
should...
heck
should
still
apply?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
when
you
say
bondable,
i
mean,
you
don't
mean
if
a
person
posts
a
bond
they're
out
on
the
street?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
casey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
beckwith,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
beckwith.
the
case
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
which
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
02-9065.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
petitioner
muhammad
is
a
state
prisoner.
he
brought
this
1983
action
alleging
that
a
prison
officer
had
charged
him
with
threatening
behavior
and
subjected
him
to
mandatory
pre-hearing
lock
up
in
retaliation
for
prior
lawsuits
and
grievance
proceedings
against
the
officer.
the
amended
complaint
sought
money
damages
solely
for
the
physical,
mental,
and
emotional
injuries
sustained
during
the
six
days
of
pre-hearing
detention.
the
district
court
awarded
summary
judgment
to
the
officer.
muhammad
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
action
was
barred
by
a
favorable
termination
requirement
set
out
in
a
1994
decision
in
heck
against
humphrey.
in
the
unanimous
per
curiam
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
and
remand
finding
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
two
mistakes.
it
mistakenly
assumed
that
muhammad
sought
expungement
of
his
misconduct
charge,
but
such
a
request
is
absent
from
his
amended
complaint.
it
also
relied
on
circuit
precedent
for
the
proposition
that
the
favorable
termination
requirement
applies
categorically
to
all
suits
challenging
prison
disciplinary
proceedings.
we
hold
that
heck’s
rule
is
trigged
only
where
a
judgment
would
raise
an
implication
about
the
validity
of
extent
of
an
underlying
conviction
although,
prison
disciplinary
proceedings
may
do
just
that
by
bearing
on
the
award
of
revocation
of
good
time
credits,
for
example.
that
is
not
necessarily
so.
in
this
case,
muhammad
raised
no
claim
on
which
habeas
relief
could
have
granted
on
any
recognized
theory
with
the
consequence
that
heck’s
rule
was
inapplicable.
so,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
unanimous.
