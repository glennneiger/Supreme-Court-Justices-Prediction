justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
understand
this
about
this
case.
i'm
having
an
awfully
hard
time
understanding
this
case,
and...
and
it
seemed
to
me
what
had
happened
was
that
the...
your
client,
who's
certainly
well
represented,
he
is
sitting
there
at
lunch
and
he
makes
some
faces
or
gestures
and
the
prison
guard
then
has
him
up
for
a
couple
of
charges
and
he
basically
is
acquitted
of
the
more
serious
one
and
they
punish
him
for
the
more...
less
serious,
threatening
behavior,
no,
it's
insolence
or
something
like
that.
he
never
says
a
word
about
retaliation,
never
says
a
word
about
it.
he
never
appeals,
which
he
could
have
done,
his
conviction.
he
never
says
to
the
prison
authorities,
hey,
throw
this
out.
the
whole
thing
was
based
on
the
guard's
desire
to
retaliate.
and
now
suddenly
have
his...
not
having
done
any
of
that,
we're
in
federal
court,
and
the
federal
magistrate
says,
you
know,
he
has
no
evidence
of
retaliation,
or
at
least
not
enough.
and
now
we're
up
here
arguing
about
heck
v.
humphrey,
sort
of
like
the
finnegan's
wake
of
the
habeas
corpus
law,
and
i...
i
can't
really
understand
how
we
even
got
here.
i...
i
don't
understand
why,
if
you're
right,
this
isn't
an
unexhausted
claim,
or
at
least
the
magistrate
said
you
don't...
your
client,
unfortunately
for
him,
has
not
enough
evidence.
how
do
we
get
into
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
reach
this...
i
can't
reach
the
sixth...
the
question
that
the
circuit
thought
was
here.
i
don't
see
what
we're
supposed
to
say.
what
are
we
supposed
to
say?
that...
that
this
unexhausted
claim,
nonetheless,
in
1983
states
a
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
said
what
i
said,
is
that
correct
what
i've
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how
do
i
decide
that,
because
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
why
i
kept
thinking
i'm
having
trouble
with
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
under
any
law
of
any
place
that
if
a
guard
has
gone
and
brought
this
whole
thing
about
as
a
way
of
retaliating
against
a
first
amendment
right,
i
can't
imagine
a
tribunal
that
wouldn't
throw
out
the
whole
thing.
i
mean,
i
know
you
say,
oh
no,
that
isn't
what
they
would
have
done.
if
he
had
gone
to
that
disciplinary
body
and
it
said,
look,
i
have
proof
here
that
this
is
total
fake
by
the
guard
in
retaliation
for
my
first
amendment
right,
what
that
body
would
have
said
is,
we
convict
you
still
of
insolence
but
not
of
the
greater
charge.
that
to
me
is
inconceivable,
but
whether
that's
so
or
not
is
a
pure
matter
of
state
law,
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
then
turns
on
a
pure
matter
of
state
law,
because
i
think
if
it
is
totally
separate
maybe
you're
right.
if
it
isn't
totally
separate,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
be
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
say,
hearing
examiner
in
the
prison,
i
want
to
tell
you
something.
the
guard's
doing
this
because
i
filed
some
earlier
claims
against
him.
what...
what
would
be
so
hard
about
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
he
doesn't
admit
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
his...
his
complaint
doesn't
say
the
kind
of
thing
you
just
said.
i
think
his
complaint
says,
i'm
sitting
there,
the
officer
made
some
faces,
lured
me
into
this
whole
thing,
and
then
what
he
charged
me
with
was
false.
so
i...
i
didn't
see...
it's
what
justice
ginsburg,
i
think,
was
talking
about
at
the
beginning.
i'm
just...
maybe
you
have
nothing
else
to
say
on
it,
but
i
saw
this
being
chopped
up.
i
saw
one
incident,
it
being
chopped
up
as
if
there
were
several
things,
one
insolence,
one
threatening
behavior,
and
then
separating
that
out,
and
i
got
totally
confused
about
the
heck
v.
humphrey
part,
the
exhaustion
part--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
you're
right
on
that
point,
then
it's
the
easiest
case
ever,
you're
obviously
right.
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
good-time
credit--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you
can
chop
up
the...
the
action
in
that
way,
if
all
you're
complaining
about
is
six
days
that
he
spent
in
pre-trial
detention
and
your
winning
on
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
anything
else,
would
not
set
aside
the
rest
of
the...
of
the
loss
of
good
time
or
anything
else,
then
you're
obviously
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
an
issue
for
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how...
how
could
that
be,
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
they
said
that,
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
i'm
having
difficulty.
you
would
have
thought
that
if
he
was
retaliated
against,
he
would
have
said
to
the
hearing
examiner,
i
was
retaliated
against
me,
the
whole
thing
is
no
good,
i
had
six
days
that
i
spent,
at
least
deduct
the
six
days
from
the
seven
days
additional
punishment
you're
giving
me.
he
didn't
say
that.
nobody
knew
a
thing
about
it.
he
didn't
ask
for
a
rehearing.
he
didn't
ask
a
judge...
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
i'm
worried
about
is
writing
an
opinion
in
this
that
says
you're
completely
right,
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that
by
every
assumption
i
have
to
make,
so
mixing
up
the
law
that
nobody
can
understand
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
even
if
you
did,
it's
not
in
the
case,
none
of
it's
in
the
case
on
the
assumption
your
colleague
there
was
making,
or
your
opponent.
imagine
that
mr.
muhammad
wins
his
claim
in
the
1983
action,
which
the
fact
that
they
thought
didn't
have
enough
evidence
suggests
he
wouldn't,
but
suppose
he
did.
then
he
says,
what
i've
showed
was
illegal
under
the
constitution
or
whatever,
was,
by
being
put
in
confinement
for
six
days
before
my
hearing,
and
my
being
charged
with
threatening
behavior,
that's
it,
that's
all.
the
rest
of
it
is
all
beside
the
point.
i
don't
complain
about
my
insolence.
i
don't
complain
about
the
seven
days.
i
don't
complain
about
the
loss
of
good
time.
i
don't
complain
about
anything
except
the
six
pre-hearing
days
and
the
later
dropped
charge
of
threatening.
so,
if
he's
right
about
that,
if
you
can
do
that,
if
in
fact
his
winning
on
that
in
no
way
calls
into
question
the
conviction
or
the
loss
of
good
time
or
the
seven
later
days
for
insolence,
then
under
heck,
of
course
he
can
bring
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so
now
i've
got
to
the
point
that
either
she's
obviously
right
or
you're
obviously
right,
and
what
it
depends
upon
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
which
is
whether,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
should
he
win
this
claim,
it
is
true
that
his
showing
the
retaliation
in
respect
to
the
six
previous
days
and
threatening
in
no
way
calls
into
question
the
validity
of
the
insolence
conviction,
the
seven
days,
and
the
loss
of
good
time.
so
i
say,
what
is
the
answer
to
that
question
of
state
law?
or
a
sister
concluded...
it's
fairly
obvious
under
the
law
that
they
are
separate.
now
what
do
you
conclude?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
not...
not
retaliation
separate
in
the
hearing
process.
you're
saying,
is
his
point
that
when
the
guard
looked
at
him
from
outside
the
cafeteria
and
made
faces
at
him,
and
then
he
came
in,
and
then
the
prisoner
stands
up
and
gives
him
some
very
dirty
looks,
according
to
the
guard.
now,
if
you
can
separate
out
there
the
retaliation,
if
you
can
separate
out
there
what
the
guard
did
by
way
of
retaliation,
making
some
very
bad
faces
through
the
window,
and
insolence
under
state
law,
which
would
exist
even
if
the
guard
were
badly
motivated
in
making
the
bad
faces,
then
you've
got
your
two
separate
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
and
the...
and
the
conduct--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
prisoner
that's
retaliation
is
that...
that...
has
to
do
with
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--would
be
his
threatening
look,
but
not
his
insolent
look.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
the
difference
in
the
sixth
circuit
rule
anymore.
what...
in
what
respect
is
it
in
the
minority?
i
thought
you
were
reading
now,
as
i
heard
you,
the
last
or
the
next
to
last
sentence
in
the
opinion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
the
sixth
circuit
simply
thought
that
if
this
individual
wins,
if
mr.
muhammad
wins,
they
would
have
to
unwind
the
entire
judgment
of
the
hearing,
which
would
include
the
judgment
having
to
do
with
insolence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
if
that's
what
they
base
it
on--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
their
rule
different
from
that
of
any
other
circuit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
suppose
now...
i
think
justice
o'connor
may
be
causing
the
light
to
dawn
in
my
head...
suppose
you're
right,
suppose
that
there
is
just
one
ball
of
wax.
suppose
the...
this
is
all
a
waste
of
time
trying
to
separate
those
two
things.
there's
just
one
thing.
there's
a
conviction,
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
we
look
to
see
what
happens
if
he
wins.
if
he
wins,
we
set
aside
the
whole
conviction,
but
good
time
is
out
of
it.
and
since
good
time
is
out
of
it,
of
course
he
can
bring
a
1983
action,
because
this
wasn't
the
kind
of
thing
that
habeas
was
designed
for.
habeas
was
about
duration
of...
of
staying
in
prison,
and
with
good
time
out
of
it,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
one
ball
of
wax
or
two.
he
can
go
in
on
1983
since
there's
no
conflict
with
the
habeas
statute.
what's
your
response
to
that?
