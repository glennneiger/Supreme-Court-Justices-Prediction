justice
john
paul
stevens
general
olson,
would
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
were
these
documents
produced
by
agencies
or
were
they
produced
by
the
energy
policy
group.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
wasn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
because
as
i
understand
it,
discovery
is
just
what
you
want
at
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
relief
can
you
get
if
you
win
the
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
tell
me
what
relief
you
can
get
if
you
win
the
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
get
discovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
get
more
discovery,
or
what
did
you
get
if
you
win
the
lawsuit?
that's
the
thing
i
hadn't
really
been
understanding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
not
asked
for
those
in
discovery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
they
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
this
de
facto
officer?
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
not
involve
this
particular
exception
from
the
faca,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
not
involve...
it
did
not
involve
a
committee
composed
entirely
of
government
employees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i
understand.
but
the...
as
to
the
working
groups,
they
were
found
not
to
be
government
employees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
were
defined,
they
were
identified
in
the
order
appointing
the
committee,
the
working
groups.
do
you
contend
that
any
of
the
people
named
in
the
order
appointing
this
committee
are
not
the
people
they
purport
to
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
people
not
named
in
the
order
are
really
members.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
different
from
that
other
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say
about
the
presumption
that
high
officials
of
the
government
obey
the
statutory
provisions
that
they
are
supposed
to
follow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
any
information
and
belief
that
the
people
who
are
said
to
have
been
appointed
were
really
not
appointed,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are...
am
i
correct
in
thinking
your
case
in
the
district
court
was
just
a
mandamus
action,
right?
there
is
no
cause
of
action
under
the
statute.
and
so
in
order
to
establish
relief
on
mandamus,
you
have
to
show
a
clearly,
clear
right
to
relief
and
jurisdictional
defect,
something
along
that
kind.
you
don't
normally
file
a
mandamus
action
and
then
get
discovery
to
see
whether
you
are
entitled
to
mandamus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
faca
doesn't
create
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't...
that
also
has
no
merit
because
the
vice
president
is
not
an
agency,
and
neither
is
the
group.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
viable
claim
you
had
was
the
mandamus
claim,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
have
given
you
discovery
you
asked
for,
if
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
only
the
group
itself
that
refuses
to
give
any
discovery.
and
if
i
understand
their
position,
if
we
give
you
discovery,
that's
just
the
same
as
giving
you
a
victory
in
the
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
does
that
prove?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
talked
to
a
lot
of
people,
got
a
lot
of
advice,
but
does
that
make
them
de
facto
members
of
the
committee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
just
because
you
said
they
talked
to
a
lot
of
people
doesn't
really
prove
anything,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me.
