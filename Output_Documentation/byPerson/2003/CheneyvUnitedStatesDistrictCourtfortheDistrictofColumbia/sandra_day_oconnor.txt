well,
let
me--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--let
me
ask
you
this.
at
some
point,
i
think
the
government
made
a
section
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss
this
suit
because
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
and
that
was
denied.
now,
could
the
government
not
have
sought
review
either
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine
at
that
time,
or
even
by
mandamus
to
address
directly
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
didn't
the
government
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
wouldn't
that
have
given
the
courts
a
chance
to
go
directly
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
court
today
vacates
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
abided
by
the
ordinary
rules
of
appellate
jurisdiction
and
under
those
rules
did
nothing
wrong.
i
would
affirm
that
court's
judgment.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
judicial
watch
and
sierra
club
alleged
that
private
persons
had
served
on
an
energy
policy
advisory
group,
in
fact,
if
not
informed.
such
participation,
if
it
occurred,
could
subject
the
group
to
the
disclosure
requirements
of
the
federal
advisory
committee
act.
the
discovery
plan
advanced
by
the
plaintiffs
and
initially
authorized
by
the
district
court,
all
agree,
was
exorbitant.
was
the
overbreadth,
of
that
initial
authorization,
a
sufficient
basis
for
an
appellant
court
to
stop
the
district
court
in
its
tracks
by
issuing
a
writ
of
mandamus?
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
it
was
not.
i
agree.
throughout
these
proceedings,
the
government
has
insistently
maintained
that
in
deference
to
the
executive's
right
to
seek
advice
from
any
court,
no
discovery
should
be
permitted
in
this
suit.
if
that
were
so
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
would
have
been
at
least
an
arguable
basis
for
stopping
the
district
court
midstream,
well
in
advance
of
any
final
appealable
judgment.
the
court,
however,
does
not
address
the
question
the
government
tendered
in
the
lower
courts.
indeed,
the
court
apparently
rejects
the
government's
position
that
no
discovery,
whatever,
is
permissible.
instead,
the
court
remands
for
consideration
whether
the
discovery
authorized
by
the
district
court
was
too
sweeping.
that
intervention
seems
to
me
out
of
order.
in
our
federal
judicial
system,
courts
generally
do
not
act
on
their
own
initiative.
they
await
a
party's
motion
or
application.
in
this
case,
the
government
quite
deliberately
did
not
move
for
an
order
narrowing
discovery
and
the
district
court
was
under
no
obligation
to
issue
such
an
order
uninvited.
more
than
once,
the
district
court
expressed
its
readiness
to
rein
in
discovery
should
the
government
so
move,
but
the
government
made
it
plain
that
no
discovery,
not
narrowed
discovery,
was
its
objective.
the
government
moved
not
for
reduced
discovery
but
for
a
protective
order
relieving
it
of
any
obligation
to
respond
to
plaintiffs'
discovery
request.
when
the
district
court
rejected
the
government's
plea
for
adjudication
of
the
case,
solely
on
the
administrative
record
and
supplemental
affidavits
and
without
discovery
of
any
kind,
the
government
sought
a
writ
of
mandamus
from
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government
asked
the
court
of
appeals
to
mandate
that
the
district
court
disallow
any
and
all
discovery.
the
court
of
appeals
refused
that
relief.
but
should
the
government
so
move,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
district
court
should
indeed,
narrow
discovery
to
ensure
that
the
plaintiffs
obtain
no
more
than
they
need
to
prove
their
case.
mandamus,
again
all
of
us
agree,
is
available
only
when
no
other
adequate
means
to
obtain
relief
is
available.
if
the
problem
was
the
overbreadth
of
the
discovery,
the
district
court
initially
authorized
as
the
court
of
appeals
explained,
a
remedy
was
plainly
in
sight.
the
government
could
move
the
district
court
to
confine
discovery.
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested,
discovery
could
be
kept
down
to
two
issues,
did
persons
other
than
federal
officials
participate
in
the
energy
policy
group,
and
if
so,
to
what
extent?
the
court
of
appeals
was
fully
aware,
to
use
its
own
words,
of
the
judiciary's
responsibility
to
police
the
separation
of
powers
in
litigation
involving
the
executive.
it
expressed
confidence
that
if
the
government
were
to
move
for
an
order
narrowing
discovery,
the
district
court,
also
mindful
of
separation
of
powers
concerns,
would
grant
such
relief.
this
court
has
no
force
to
disturb
that
judgment
or
to
quote
the
court
of
appeals
for
insensitivity
to
separation
of
powers
concerns
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
shows
it
had
well
in
mind.
