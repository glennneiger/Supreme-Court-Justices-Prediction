justice
anthony
m.

would
you
say
it's
also
a
separation
of
powers
question,
mr.
olson,
to
the
extent
that
it
involves
the
ability
of
the
courts
to
formulate
rules
to
prevent
them
from
deciding
questions
unnecessarily?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
said
this
is
a
case
about
separation
of
powers.
and
i
wanted...
i
asked
whether
or
not
the
authority
of
the
courts
is
not
also
involved
here,
because
there
is
a
concern
that
we
should
have
rules
designed
to
prevent
us
from
unnecessarily
deciding
questions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
in
the
nixon
case,
the
president
exercised
his
privilege
and
it
was
overruled.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
not,
it's
not
on
all
fours
in
that
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
are
not
defying
a
court
order
if
you
exercise
a
privilege.
or
if
you
assert
a
privilege.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
we
get
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
we
get
to
the
jurisdiction
point?
why
is
it
that
you
went
to...
that
you
are
justified
in
going
to
the
court
of
appeals?
because
there
is
a
new
exception
to
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
or
because
you
are
seeking
mandate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
exception?
is
it
something
new
under
cox
or
is
it
on
one
of
the
before
cox
exceptions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
have
already
discussed
that
he
did
not...
the
vice
president
in
this
case
did
not
exercise
his
privilege.
wasn't
close
to
being
held.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
you
describe
the
general
exception
that
you
want
us
to
have
for
discovery
disputes
in
the
district
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
it
involves
the
vice
president,
it's
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
know
better
than
most
the
dynamics...
than
most
attorneys,
the
dynamics
of
the
discovery
system.
i
hear
in
your
argument
echoes
of
every
discovery
dispute
i've
ever
listened
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
wonder
about
that.
i
can
see
you
coming
up
here
and
saying,
everyone
knows
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
is
not
interlocutory.
there
has
been
no
discovery
yet.
there's
been
no
order.
they
haven't
been
heard.
i
can
hear
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
all
you
would
get
if
you
won
the
suit,
and
it
goes
back
to
justice
stevens'
question.
isn't
the
posture
of
this
case
one
in
which
what
happens
at
the
end
of
discovery
if
you
prevail
and
get
discovery
is
substantially
the
same
as
if
you
won
the
suit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
those
are
fairly
concluded
within
the
separation
of
powers
privilege
that
the
government
is
asserting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's,
but
that's
the
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the,
if
the
statute
requires
disclosure
of
all
these
things,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
as
a
final
order,
and
discovery,
when
they
are
hit
with
a
discovery
order,
it
gives
them
all
the
same
information,
why
isn't
the
government
right,
that
this
really
is
the
essence
of
the
suit
and
we
should
hear
the
merits
of
it
now.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
how
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
give
any
advice
at
all
if
it
says
it
has
no
jurisdiction
or
the
case
is
improperly
before
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
overall
within
the
scope
of
the
order
that
the
district
court
gave?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
plaintiffs
who
commenced
this
case
in
the
united
states
district
court
alleged
that
members
of
the
presidential
committee
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
federal
statute,
the
federal
advisory
committee
act.
the
common
shorthand
reference
to
that
law
is
faca.
the
task
force
in
question
was
the
national
energy
policy
development
group.
its
chairman
was
vice
president
cheney.
in
a
memorandum
establishing
the
group,
the
president
of
the
united
states
directed
the
task
force
to
develop
a
national
energy
policy.
faca
requires
advisory
committees
to
comply
with
detailed
procedural
and
disclosure
requirements.
and
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
the
task
force
was
not
in
compliance.
the
defendants
pointed
out
that
faca
exempts
from
its
coverage,
committees
that
are
composed
wholly
or
full-time
or
permanent
part-time
officers
or
employees
of
the
federal
government,
and
the
named
members
of
the
group
all
did
fall
within
this
category.
now,
the
plaintiffs
counted
that
despite
its
formal
composition,
the
group
have
--
had
included
non-government
employees
in
its
deliberations.
and
under
this
theory,
the
plaintiffs
have
said
the
exemption
from
faca
did
not
apply.
now,
that
--
those
contingents
were
the
main
underlying
issue
in
that
case.
then,
the
case
became
clouded
with
pretrial
and
procedural
questions
that
give
rise
to
our
decision
today.
the
precise
dispute
before
us
began
as
a
discovery
issue.
the
plaintiffs
demanded
information
and
documents
about
the
group's
meetings
and
deliberations
and
these
plaintiffs
are
the
respondents
here
in
this
court.
the
vice
president
and
other
defendants
are
the
petitioners
here.
the
government
representing
the
vice
president
and
his
co-members
on
the
committee
took
the
position
that
the
information
requests
were
unreasonable.
merely
responding
to
the
request,
they
said,
in
effect,
would
give
the
plaintiffs
all
the
relief
they
sought
on
the
merits.
furthermore,
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
vice
president,
it
was
argued
that
compliance
with
the
discovery
request
was
so
burdensome
and
intrusive
that
this
in
itself
would
violate
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers.
the
district
court
rejected
the
government's
objections.
it
ordered
discovery
and
it
denied
the
government's
motion
to
certify
that
ruling
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
vice
president
and
the
other
defendants
brought
in
action
in
the
court
of
appeals
seeking
the
writ
of
mandamus.
it
asked
that
the
district
court
be
directed
to
hold
the
discovery
and
dismiss
the
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
mandamus
petition.
we
granted
certiorari.
we
now
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
we
reject
respondent's
preliminary
argument
that
the
mandamus
position
--
petition
was
jurisdictionally
out
of
time
under
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
4a.
that
rule
by
its
plain
terms
applies
only
to
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
it's
inapplicable
to
the
government's
mandamus
petition
under
the
all
writs
act.
respondent's
alternative
argument
that
the
mandamus
petition
was
barred
by
the
equitable
doctrine
of
latches
also
lacks
merit.
the
government's
active
litigation
posture
following
the
district
court
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
a
neglect
or
delay
that
would
make
application
of
latches
appropriate.
now,
with
respect
to
the
central
issue
in
the
case
as
it
now
comes
to
us,
the
court
of
appeals
was
incorrect
to
conclude
that
it
had
no
authority
to
exercise
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
mandamus
under
the
--
on
the
ground
that
the
government
protect
--
could
protect
its
rights
by
asserting
executive
privilege
in
the
district
court.
with
the
vice
president
not
a
party,
the
case
might
present
different
considerations,
but
the
vice
president
and
his
co-members
on
the
task
force
are
the
subject
of
the
discovery
orders.
the
mandamus
petition
alleges
that
the
discovery
orders
threaten
substantial
intrusions
on
the
process
by
which
those
closest
to
the
government
advising.
these
facts
and
allegation
removed
this
case
from
the
category
of
ordinary
discovery
orders
where
interlocutory
review
is
unavailable
through
mandamus
or
otherwise.
the
court
has
held
that
a
president's
communications
and
activities
encompass
a
vastly
wider
range
of
sensitive
material,
than
would
be
true
of
any
ordinary
individual
and
chief
justice
marshall
sitting
as
a
trial
judge
recognized
the
unique
position
of
the
executive
branch
when
he
stated
that
in
no
case
would
a
court
be
required
to
proceed
against
the
president
as
against
an
ordinary
individual.
this
separation
of
powers
consideration
should
inform
a
court
of
appeals
evaluation
of
a
mandamus
petition
involving
the
president
or
the
vice
president.
accepted
mandamus
standards
are
brought
enough
to
allow
court
of
appeals
to
prevent
the
lower
court
from
interfering
with
a
co-equal
branch's
ability
to
discharge
its
constitutional
responsibilities.
respondents
place
heavy
reliance
on
united
states
versus
nixon,
the
case
that
ordered
the
president
to
submit
information
in
response
to
subpoenas
in
the
criminal
matter.
now,
that
case
is
not
controlling
here
for
various
reasons
that
we
discuss
in
our
opinion.
among
them
is
that
there
are
no
checks
in
the
civil
discovery
process
that
are
analogous
to
the
constraints
in
the
criminal
subpoena
context
to
filter
out
insubstantial
legal
claims.
the
narrow
subpoena
orders
in
nixon
also
stand
on
a
different
footing
from
the
unbounded
discovery
request
in
this
case.
we
decline
petitioners'
invitation
to
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
issue
the
writ
against
the
district
court.
this
is
not
a
case
where
having
considered
the
issues,
the
court
of
appeals
abused
its
discretion
by
failing
to
issue
the
writ.
instead,
the
court
of
appeals
relying
on
its
mistaken
reading
of
nixon
terminated
its
inquiry
without
reaching
the
weighty
separation-of-powers
objections
raised
in
the
case,
much
less
exercising
its
discretion
to
determine
whether
the
writ
of
mandamus
is
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
we
leave
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
address
these
--
these
issues
in
the
first
instance.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurrent
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
joins.
