mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
judicial
watch
submits
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
district
court's
discovery
orders,
but
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument
that
there
was
jurisdiction,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
district
court
properly
denied
petitioners'
motion
to
dismiss,
both
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
consistent
with
circuit
precedent
and
separation
of
powers.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
well,
no--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--that's
correct.
the
government
is
arguing,
however,
that
the
discovery
that
the
district
court
did
order
should
not
have
been
ordered
because
of
the
underlying
merits
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
my
understanding
of
the
government's
argument.
we
submit
that
that's
a--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--i
think
that's
indistinguishable
from
arguing--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--if
you
could
allow
me
to
proceed.
the
district
court
ordered
discovery
because
it
believed
that
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issues
that
the
government
is
raising
in
their
briefs.
in
denying
the
motion,
the
district
court
properly
applied
what
was
circuit
precedent
at
the
time
and
is
circuit
precedent,
the
aaps
case,
allowing
for
this
de
facto
membership
doctrine
that
we
have
talked
about.
the
district
court
thought
that
if
discovery
yielded
information
that
would
show
there
were
no,
there
was
no
involvement
of
private
individuals
in
the
task
force,
then
there
would
be
no
reason,
no
reason
to
even
reach
the
constitutional
issues.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
i
think
the
court
in
the
aaps
case,
that
the
district
court
was
relying
on,
and
that
the
circuit
court
was
also--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--i
think
it's
not
looking
just
at
voting,
but
whether
or
not
there
is
anything
that
functionally
distinguishes
the
members,
the
de
facto
members
from
the
actual
members.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
it
could
be
a
vote.
but
there
could
also
be...
it
could
also
be
more
than
that,
in
this
particular
instance--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
in
this
particular
instance,
there
was
one
allegation
we
set
forth
in
our
complaint
of
policy
recommendations
that
were
conveyed
to
the
vice
president
and
those
recommendations
did
end
up
mirroring
recommendations
that
were--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--that's
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
congress
would
have
created
such
a
statute,
and
i
don't
think
they
did
create
such
a
statute.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
the
case
law
that
has
interpreted
the
statute
and
the
statute
themselves
requires
a
certain
degree
of
formality,
structure
and
continuity
to
an
advisory
committee
before,
before
the
requirements
of
the
statute
begin
to
apply.
circuit
court
precedent,
including
the
nader
vs.
baroody
case,
that
i
think
all
the
parties
have
cited
in
their
brief
held
exactly
that.
that
there
has
to
be...
there
cannot
be
ad
hoc
committee
meeting
or
ad
hoc
committee
members.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
well,
certainly
there
has
to
be
an
establishing
document,
according
to
faca.
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
degree
of
understanding
of
what
the
membership
of
the
committee
is
going
to
be.
there
talks
about
an
end
point
to
the
committee
as
well.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
that,
that
may
trigger
the
questions
that
we
made.
and
i
think
there
is
one
thing
that's
important
about
this
particular
committee,
and
the
document
that
established
it.
it's
a
january
29th
memorandum
from
the
president.
it's
in
the
appendix
at
157,
i
believe.
and
in
that
document,
the
vice
president
was
given
the
discretion
to
create
subordinate
working
groups.
there
is
nothing
in
that
document
that
limits
subordinate
working
groups
to
consisting
only
of
private
employees.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
sorry.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
i
think
again
what
becomes
important
is
the
membership
of
that
task
force.
and
if
that,
if
the
idea
behind
creating
that
task
force
allowed
for,
in
the
aaps
case,
outside
consultants
or
consultants
of
undetermined
origin,
in
this
instance
subgroups,
without
any
limitation
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
be
federal
employees
or
not
federal
employees,
in
that
instance,
the
requirements
of
the
statute
could
be
triggered.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
well,
there
was
nothing
in
the
originating
document
that
described
who
those
subgroups
would
report
to.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--that's
whether
or
not--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
it
could
very
well
be
whether
they
reported
to
the
committee
as
a
whole
or
to
the
executive--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--they
are
not
the
committee,
but
faca
includes
within
its
definition
of
an
advisory
committee
any
subgroups
or
working
groups
of
a
committee.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
i
don't
think
it
is
the
essence
of
the
suit.
i
think
the
appellate
court
gave
some
strong
advice
to
the
district
court
to
limit
discovery
to
two
points,
really.
number
one,
being
the
involvement,
whether
there
were
private
individuals
involved.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--and
to
what
extent--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--well,
i
think...
and
also
a
significant
point
to
be
considered
in
that
regard
is
that
the
government
did
not
object
to
the
scope
of
this,
of
the
discovery
that
it
was...
as
it
was
served.
they
had
the
opportunity,
they
had
every
opportunity
to
submit
particularized
objections,
including
privileges,
but
not
just
privileges,
also
objections
as
to
scope,
relevance,
materiality.
the
usual
long
litany
of
discovery
objections
that
any
party
is
able
to.
they
declined
that
opportunity.
the
district
court
was
very
careful.
i
think
he
bent
over
backwards
in
inviting
them
to
assert
objections
on
several
occasions.
they
chose
not
to
do
so.
so
for
them
to
come
back--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--they
did
not
make
specific
objections.
no.
i'm
not
saying
they
consented
to
it.
they
were,
they
were
clear
in
their
objections
to
any
discovery
whatsoever,
discovery
that
the
district
court
felt
it
needed
as
a
means
of
constitutional
avoidance
in
order
to
determine,
first
of
all,
whether
the
statute
applies.
and
secondly,
in
order
to
narrow
any
constitutional
issues
that
it
might
have
to
consider
if
the
statute
did
apply.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
that's
correct.
they
have
not.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
justice
stevens,
we
had
actually
several
different
counts
in
our
complaint,
which
included,
first
of
all,
we
did
assert
a
count
under
faca.
that
was
dismissed.
we
also
asserted
a--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--that
was
ultimately
the
basis
for
the
dismissal.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
but
we
also
had
an...
an
apa
claim.
and
then
ultimately--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--well,
the
reasoning
behind
the
apa
claim--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--well,
the
apa
claim
is
continuing
with
respect
to
the
agency
defendants.
the
heads...
i
shouldn't
say
the
agency
defendants.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
actually,
they
have--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--the
agency
defendants
have
given
us
some
discovery,
but
at
the
same
time,
they
also
asserted
objections
as
to
executive
privilege
and
deliberative
process
in
answering
our
questions.
they
did
not
give
us
any
information
about
what
role,
if
any,
independent
individuals,
private
individuals
played
in
the
deliberations
of
the
task
force.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
i
guess
i
just
want
to...
is
this
as
a
comparison
to
the
discovery
that,
that
was
ordered?
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
if
discovery
is
limited
to
the
narrowing
that
the
appellate
court
suggested,
none
of
that
information,
i
believe,
would
be
something
that
we
would
get
under
the
statute
if
we
were
to
win.
under
the
statute,
we
are
entitled
to
basically
the
documents
of
the
committee
as
limited
by
any
properly
applied
exemptions
of
foia.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
i
wouldn't...
no,
we
don't
get
more
discovery.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
well,
the
documents
the
appellate
court
was
talking
about,
and
in
addition
to
interrogatories
which
we
don't
get...
and
actually,
at
one
point
the
government
actually
suggested
that
discovery
take
place
on
the
basis
of
interrogatories.
we
wouldn't
get
any
interrogatory
answers.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
we
would
get
documents.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
we
would
get,
i
believe
the
statute
allows
disclosure
of
all
of
the
documents
of
the
task
force
subject
to
the
limitations
of
foia.
the
documents
are
produced
as
if
the
task
force
was
an
agency
subject
to
foia,
and
all
the
exemptions
that
foia
applies,
i
believe,
apply
to
these
documents.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
that's
right.
i
think
the
discovery
as
suggested
or
as
narrowed
by
the
appellate
court
is
a
much
smaller
subset
of
the
information
we
would
get
if
we
were
entitled
to...
if
we
ultimately
prevail
on
the
merits
of
the
lawsuit.
there
has
been
a
couple
of
statements
with
respect
to
our
complaint
being
based
on
nothing
more
than
mere
unsupported
allegations.
that
is
a
false
statement,
in
our
view.
in
order
to
support
our
claims,
we
are
relying
first
and...
first
and
foremost
on
the
statement
in
the
memorandum
creating
the
document
that
says
the
vice
president
has
discretion
to
create
subordinate
working
groups.
then
we
also
attach
several
statements,
acknowledgments
by
the
government,
that
describe
meetings
between
task
force
representatives
and
representatives
of
enron
and
representatives
of
other
working
groups.
i
believe
the
government
itself
acknowledged
there
were
at
least
five
such
meetings.
we
know
that
the
vice
president
met
with
the
chairman
of
enron,
ken
lay.
the
vice
president
himself
in
an
interview
he
gave
on
nightline
said
we
met
with
all
kinds
of
folks,
we
met
with
energy
groups,
we
met
with
environmental
groups--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--the
point
is
that
this
shows
the
involvement
of
outside--
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
--well,
that's
the
question
that
we
are
seeking
to
answer
through
our
discovery.
the
point
is
that
this
is
not
an
unsupported,
these
are
not
mere
unsupported
allegations.
mr.
paul
j.
orfanedes
well,
if
you
put
that
together,
the
allegations
of
the
individuals
that
were
met
with,
with
the
statement
in
the
memorandum
that
allows
the
vice
president
discretion
to
create
working
groups,
we
think
it
does
at
least
raise
a
significant
question
as
to
whether
outside
individuals
were
participating
in
these
working
groups
and
participating
in
the
committee
as
a
whole.
in
any
event,
the
district
court
firmly
believes
that
it
needed
this
discovery
in
order
to
answer
these
questions.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
