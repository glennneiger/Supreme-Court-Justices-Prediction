justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
olson,
we
would
also
not
get
to
it
if
we
adhered
to
the
firm
final
judgment
rule
which
is
the
first
hurdle
that
you
have
to
overcome.
you
wouldn't
get
to
the
merits
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
for
us
to
review
at
this
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
olson,
would
you
clarify
why
we
are
dealing
with
the
merits.
i
thought,
and
correct
me
if
i
misunderstand
this,
that
the
merits
will
have
to
be
resolved
in
the
first
instance
by
the
court
below.
if
we
find
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
if
we
agree
with
you,
for
example,
that
this
discovery
should
not
have
been
allowed,
then
why
should
we
take
the
first
view
of
the
merits
of
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
still
be
asking
us
to
resolve
the
merits
in
the
first
instance,
not
to
review
any
lower
court
decision
because
they
said
there
ought
to
be
discovery
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
we
are
dealing
with
the
situation
at
the
two,
the
two
justices,
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
both
said,
this
is
too,
this
discovery
order
was
too
broad.
it
ought
to
be
trimmed.
now
the
district
judge
would
have
that
message,
so
you
could
have
gone
back
there
and
said
see,
district
judge,
this
has
to
be
narrowed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
why
did
the
government
turn
over
36,000
pages
of
paper
from
the
agencies
that
were
also
a
part
of
this
action
if
the
whole
thing
is
so
misguided,
if
the
application
of
this
act
violates
the
separation
of
powers,
why
did
the
government
respond
to
the
request
for
information
from
the
agencies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
get,
you
didn't
make
the
argument
that
no
discovery,
you
are
very
clear
about
that,
no
discovery
is
appropriate
under
this
statute.
and
yet
you
didn't,
whether...
whether
the
information
that
was
turned
over
could
have
been
gotten
under
foia,
this
wasn't
a
foia
suit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
specifically,
these
pages
that
have
been
previously
disclosed
to
other
requesters
under
foia.
the
request
in
this
case,
wasn't
it
made
to
them
under
the
faca?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
kind
of
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
can't
appeal
from,
you
can't
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
that's
really
interlocutory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
only
if
the
district
judge
enters
a
default
judgment,
but
that's
just
one
of
many
options.
the
district
judge
isn't
required
to
take
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
olson,
i
thought
that
the,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
there
could
be
discovery
on
two
issues.
and
one
was
what
non-federal
offices
participated,
and
two,
to
what
extent.
judge
tattle
and
judge
edwards
were
both
pretty
clear
on
that,
that
that
would
be
the
nature
of
the
discovery
permissible.
