475,
richard

vs.
united
states
district
court.
general
olson?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
essential
to
the
government's
position,
i
take
it,
that
this
court
reject
the
de
facto
doctrine
that
was
developed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
construe
it
narrowly,
but
nonetheless,
retain
the
de
facto
doctrine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
district,
was
the
district
court's
discovery
order
unconditional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
did
it
say,
you
know,
the
government
must
produce
thus
and
so,
thus
and
so,
thus
and
so?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it,
general
olson,
that
from
the
rest
of
your
argument
that
traditional
executive
privilege
doctrine
would
not
cover
all
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
you
think
exist
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
very
well,
general
olson.
mr.
morrison,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily,
that
would
be
summary
judgment,
not
motion
to
dismiss.
motion
to
dismiss
just
deals
with
the
pleadings.
you
are
not
talking
about
discovery
at
that
stage.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
rather
strange
doctrine,
that
we
can't
tinker
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done,
even
though
we
disagree
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
you
say
that
we
then
are
prohibited
from
saying
the
court
of
appeals
de
facto
doctrine
is
wrong?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
morrison.
mr.
orfanedes,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
surely
is
one
thing
that's
not
before
us,
is
it,
is
the
district
court's
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
it's
not
appealable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suggesting
that
they...
they
consented
to
the
discovery,
but
just
they
did
not
make
specific
objections?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
why
it
was
dismissed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
orfanedes.
general
olson,
you
have
five
minutes
left.
general
olson,
i
hope
you'll
address
the
point
whether
you'll,
whether
you'll
have
to
disclose
anything
more
at
the
end
of
the
suit
than
you
will
under
the
discovery.
is
there
a
big
difference
between
what
they
get
under
the
discovery
order
and
what
they
would
get
if
they
win
the
suit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
03-475,
cheney
against
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
