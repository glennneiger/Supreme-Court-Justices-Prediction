all
discovery,
not...
you
are
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
isn't
that
simply
the
basic
argument
on
the
merits
again.
the
reason...
i
think
you're
saying
the
reason
we
can't
have
discovery
is
because
the
whole
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
president.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
if
we
go...
i
mean,
if
we
do
what
justice
ginsburg
is
trying
to
do,
and
that
is
get
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
without
passing,
in
the
first
instance,
as
accord
in
the
first
instance
on
the
merits,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
jurisdictional
question,
to
me
at
least,
boils
down
to
this.
why
should
we
accept
your
position
on
jurisdiction
when
jurisdiction
goes
to
the
propriety
with
constitutional
overtones,
of
course,
of
discovery,
and
we
don't
have
the
discovery
order
refined
yet.
if
this
case
goes
back
or
if
it
had
indeed
not
been
appealed
in
the
first
place,
you
would
have
been
fighting
with
your
colleagues
on
the
other
side
about
what
specific
discovery
to
allow.
once
we
knew
what
the
district
court
specifically
was
going
to
allow,
we
would
have
a
fairly
sharply
focused
question,
and
that
arguably
would
be
subject
to
an
appeal
regardless
of
the
final
judgment
rule.
but
we
don't
have
that
focus
yet.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
never
came
down...
i
realize
that,
i
have
read
the
orders.
but
you
never
came
back,
or
the
government
never
came
back
and
said,
well,
that
order
is
too
broad
because,
and
we
think
it
could
be
allowed
to
this
extent,
and
there
was...
there
was
no,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
process
of
trying
to
refine
the
discovery
order
down
to
anything
beyond
the
generalities
that
we
have
on
the
record.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
did
not
assert
any
executive
privilege.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
we
don't
know
what
might
be
subject
to
executive
privilege,
and
sustained,
perhaps,
and
what
would
not
be.
and
it's
the
what
would
not
be
that
would
raise
the
constitutional
issue
that
you
are
trying
to
raise.
and
it
seems
to
me,
until
we
know
exactly
what
that
is,
there
is
a
pretty
good
argument
that
the
final
judgment
rule
should
not
be
subject
to
exception
at
this
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
is
an
interim
position
in
which
one
would
say,
well,
it
makes
a
difference
to
this
extent,
that
until
the
executive
privilege
has
been
claimed
and
has
been
ruled
upon,
the
extent
of...
to
which
they
have
a
plausible
separation
of
powers
argument
is
not
clear.
i
mean,
we
could
take
that
position,
i
take
it,
you
would
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
they
did
not
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
clearly
given
them
now
to
whittle
that
order
down.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
just
embellish
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
a
little
bit?
and
that
is,
if
you,
if
you
get
some
discovery,
and
you
win
your
case,
what
do
you
get
when
you
win
that
you
will
not
already
have
gotten
by
the
discovery?
justice
david
h.
souter
whatever
the
discovery
is.
you
got
enough
discovery
to
win
your
case,
you
win
it.
what
do
you
get
then
besides
a
statement
saying
they
were
wrong,
you
win.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
saying
you
get
more
discovery?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
are
these
documents
that
you
would
get
that
you
would
not
already
have
gotten
at
the
discovery
stage?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
would
get
documents?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
documents
would
you
get?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you'd
get
a
broad
disclosure
is
what
you
are
saying?
