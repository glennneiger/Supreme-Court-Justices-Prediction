justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
that
if
you
just
asserted
executive
privilege
as
to
each
discovery
request
that
you
thought
would
be
burdensome.
and
then
if
that's
granted,
you
have
no
problem.
and
if
it's
denied,
you
immediately
come
up
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that's
your
legal
argument,
and
you
may
be
right
about
that.
but
assuming
you
are
right
about
that,
you
bring
up
the
broader
issue
on
an
appeal
from
the
case.
see
if
you
lose
it.
and
as
to
your
being
right,
being
right
i
guess
isn't
enough
to
get
you
to
appeal
a
discovery
order
if...
but
maybe
you
can
if
you
really
need
to.
so
my
question
is,
why
did
you
really
need
to
since
you
could
have
asserted
executive
privilege
as
to
each
individual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that.
but
that's
an
argument
which
you
made
in
response
to
my
question
which
is
an
argument
on
the
merits.
and
i
want
you
to
focus
on
the
fact
that...
assume
i
agree
with
you
on
the
merits.
you
will
have
a
chance
to
make
that
argument
on
the
merits,
even
if
you
lose
here
and
if
you
lose
the
case.
now,
my
question
is
addressed
to
the
need
for
an
interim
appeal
from
the
discovery.
and
as
to
that,
what
is
your
response
to
the
fact
that
you
could
get
your
interim
appeal
or
at
least
preserve
yourself
from
harm
if
you
had
asserted
executive
privilege
to
the
individual
bits
of
the
discovery
order
with
which
you
disagreed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
delay
this.
but
to
me
this
is
important.
assume
that
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
completely
right.
assume
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
don't
want
to,
but
for
argument's
sake,
then
what
they
are
really
asking
for
is
a
separate
exception
from
the
collateral
order.
i
mean,
and
a
separate
exception
that
allows
them,
the
vice
president
and
the
president,
and
nobody
else,
to
take
an
appeal
from
discovery.
now,
executive
privilege
in
my
mind
came
in
by
asking,
well,
shouldn't
they
at
least
have
to
assert
that
it's
that
kind
of
imposition
upon
the
president's
office
prior
to
being
able
to
carve
out,
under
whatever
name,
a
separate
exception
that
would
permit
an
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
isn't
it
wrong?
why
isn't,
why
isn't
the
court
of
appeals
wrong
on
that,
the
argument
being
that
this
is
not
a
discovery
statute.
this
is
not
an
ex
parte
communications
statute.
this
is
not
a
freedom
of
information
act
statute.
this
is
a
blue
ribbon
committee
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
turn
it
into
the
latter,
you
will
stop--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
will
stop
every...
you'll
stop
every
lower
level
official
in
government
when
he
is
creating
legislative
policy
from
getting
on
the
phone
and
calling
up
whoever
he
pleases.
you
understand
that
argument.
i
want
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
arguing
that
it's
not
before
us...
what
they
are
arguing
is
that
this
statute
doesn't
apply,
so
therefore
there
was
no
discovery.
the
statute
isn't
one
under
which
you
can
go
behind
the
certification
of
the
president,
the
vice
president,
et
cetera.
we
both
read
their
briefs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well
then
go
ahead
and
make
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--exactly.
now,
their
problem
with
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
i
take
it,
is
the
following.
forget
the
vice
president.
you
are
assistant
secretary
of
antitrust.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
assistant
secretary
of
hhs
in
charge
of
drug
policy.
you
are
trying
to
develop
a
legislative
proposal.
every
staff
person
in
the
congress,
given
such
a
task,
would
phone
everyone
in
sight
who
knows
about
it
outside
the
congress
to
try
to
develop
sound
proposals.
and
if
it's
a
serious
matter,
they'd
have
50
meetings
with
everybody
under
the
sun.
and
if
you
assigned
the
same
thing,
try
to
do
the
same
thing
under
your
interpretation
of
the
act,
every
one
of
those
outside
people
could
be
hit
with
a
discovery
order,
what
meetings
did
you
go
to,
what
did
you
say,
what
did
you
do.
and
their
final
point
is
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
in
this
statute
to
have
created
that
circumstance,
putting
government
in
a
cocoon
when
it
develops
legislative
policy.
now,
i
have
overstated
what
they
said,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
a
response
from
you
as
to
what
i
take
is
their
basic
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
don't
think
it's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
cause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
explain
the
degree
of
formality
that
you
think
triggers
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
turns
to
the
head
of
the
antitrust
division
and
says
i
want
a
legislative
proposal
about
webb-pomerene
acts.
you
get
together
with
your
counterpart
at
state,
create
an
interagency
task
force
and
give
me
a
document,
and
he
announces
the
whole
thing
in
a
public
speech.
now,
do
we
have
the
application,
in
your
opinion,
of
faca
that
would
trigger
the
questions
i
mentioned?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
interagency
task
force
creates
the
faca
situation
in
your
view,
imagine
that
i
have
repeated
my
first
question,
but
simply
applied
it
to
interagency
task
forces.
if
you
remember
my
first
question,
it
had
to
do
with
the
cocoon.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
is
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
point
is
it's
different,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
want
stuff
on
discovery
that
has
to
do
with
who
said
what
to
who.
and
if
they
win,
they
get
a
different
set
of
things
which
are
the
documents
of
agendas,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
