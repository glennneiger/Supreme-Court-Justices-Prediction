mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
the
separation
of
powers.
the
constitution
explicitly
commits
to
the
president's
discretion
the
authority
to
obtain
the
opinions
of
subordinates
and
to
formulate
recommendations
for
legislation.
congress
may
neither
intrude
on
the
president's
ability
to
perform
these
functions,
nor
authorize
private
litigants
to
use
the
courts
to
do
so.
as
this
court
has
construed
the
federal
advisory
committee
act
to
avoid
what
the
court
regarded
and
described
as
formidable
constitutional
questions,
faca
does
not
permit
the
litigation
and
discovery
the
respondents
wish
to
pursue.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
with
respect
to
the...
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
are
asking
a
question
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
because
that's
an
issue
that's
before
the
court,
or
with
respect
to
construing
the
federal
advisory
committee
act
to
avoid
the
constitutional
questions
that
are
implicit
in
that
statute.
we
think
that
there
is
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
we
think
that
what
the
court
did
in
public
citizen
was
make
it
very
clear
that
because
of
the
formidable
constitutional
questions,
in
fact,
the
court
referred
to
the
constitutional
questions
in
that
case
as
undeniable.
the
court
construed
the
federal
advisory
committee
act
not
to
apply
in
that
case.
if
that
same
rationale
is
applied
here,
the
court
will
not
get
to
the
constitutional
question
which
faca
would
inevitably
raise
if
it
intruded
upon
the
president's
power
to
obtain
opinions
from
his
subordinates,
and
to
make
recommendations
to
congress
with
respect
to
legislation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
this
case
fits
squarely,
we
submit,
within
what
the
court
decided
unanimously
in
the
united
states
vs.
nixon
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
a
denial
of
immediate
review
would
render
impossible
any
review
whatsoever
of
the
claims,
the
separation
of
powers
claims
that
are
being
made
here,
because
the
vice
president...
and
the
vice
president
is
acting
as
the
subordinate
and
surrogate
for
the
president
here.
this
is
the
president's
authority.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it's
not
all
fours
in
that
sense,
but
the
principle
as
articulated
by
the
court
on
pages
683...
i
mean
691
to
692.
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
there
is
that
the
traditional
contempt
avenue
or
any
aspect
of
what
would
be
required
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
defy
a
court
order
would
be
both
unseemly
and
would
unnecessarily
provoke
a
constitutional
confrontation.
what
the
court
said
in
that
case,
when
we
are
talking
about,
when
the
court
is
talking
about
important
separation
of
powers
questions,
the
president
is
in
the
position
of
having
to
defy
a
court
order,
risk
sanctions
of
some
sort.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
this
case,
the
separation
of
powers
issue
in
this
case
goes
far
beyond
the
assertion
of
executive
privilege.
executive
privilege
concerns
itself
with
particular
documents
or
a
concern
over
the
relationship
that
particular
documents
refer
to.
the
objection
here
is
to
the
process.
the
president
and
the
vice
president
are
being
subjected
to
litigation
and
discovery
which
goes
far
beyond
what
the
statute
would
require
here.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
de
facto
doctrine
is
wrong.
it's
inconsistent
with
public
citizen,
and
if
the
court
were
to
construe...
find
that
somehow
that
the
statute
could
be
construed
to
create
a
de
facto
doctrine,
which
no
court
has
ever
done,
finally
done
in
connection
with
a
case,
that
the
case,
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
as
it
applied
to
these
circumstances.
however,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
court
does
not
need
to
get
there
by
construing
the
statute
narrowly,
as
the
court
did
in
public
citizen,
unanimously,
i
might
say,
because
three
of
the
eight
justices
felt
that
the
statute,
if
it
were
construed
any
other
way,
would
be
unconstitutional.
construing
the
statute
in
that
fashion--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
not
deal
with
it
at
all.
i
mean,
the
statute
itself,
we
submit,
addresses...
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
statute
may
be
construed
in
the
context
of
a
presidential
advisory
group
explicitly
excluding
a
committee
that's
formed
of
all
government
employees,
and
as
construed
by
the
court
in
that
case,
either...
the
words
used
in
the
statute
are
established
or
utilized.
as
construed
by
that
case,
this
commission
was
established
by
the
president.
it
would
be
exempt
on
its
face
from
application
of
faca.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
that
would
raise
very
serious
constitutional
questions.
as
an
antecedent
to
that,
there
was
no
intention
when
congress
passed
a
statute
to
prohibit
or
regulate
ex
parte
communications
between
the
executive
branch
and
members
of
the
public.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i'm
going
to,
i'm
going
to
quote
from
the
public
citizen
decision
itself,
which
authoritatively
and
specifically
defined
the
term
or
utilized
in
a
way
which
would
be
flatly
inconsistent
with
this
question
that
you
just
raised.
but
i
also
want
to
mention,
and
would
want
to
go
on
to
say,
that
would
require
that
the
courts
ignore
the
presumption
of
regularity
which
applies
to
the
executive,
particularly
when
the
executive
is
performing
core
executive
branch
functions,
which
it
clearly
is
in
this
case.
but
to
get
back
to
your
question,
the
court
in
public
citizen,
on
page
462,
specifically
defined
what
or
utilized
meant
in
that
case.
and
defined
it
in
this
way,
in
order
to
avoid
the
undeniable
formidable
constitutional
questions
that
would
be
raised
if
it
was
defined
as
you
suggested.
the
court
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
seems
to
me
in
the
context
of
this
case,
justice
ginsburg,
that
once
jurisdiction
is
acknowledged,
the
context
of
the
case,
the
administrative
record,
which
specifically
contains
within
it
the
presidential
directive
which
created
the
advisory
committee
only
to
include
members
of
the
executive
branch.
the
report
of
the
committee,
which
specifically
identifies
as
members
only
members
of
the
executive
branch,
and
the
affidavit
or
declaration
that's
on
file
from
the
deputy
director,
which
said
that
the
only
participants
were
members
of
the
executive
branch,
and
the
presumption
of
reliability,
of
regularity
that
the
court
consistently,
u.s.
vs.
armstrong
is
one
case,
the
court
consistently,
absent
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary,
accords
executive
branch
action--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
but
we
are
submitting
that
the
discovery
itself
violates
the
constitution,
violates
faca
as
properly
construed.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--unconstitutional
if
it...
if
applied
in
these
circumstances.
now,
it
may
be
construed--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
is
two
answers
to
that...
at
least
two,
justice
souter.
in
the
first
place,
the
discovery
was
ordered
by
the
district
court.
it
may
be
found
at
pages
215
to
220.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
every
effort
was
made
with
respect
to
the
actions
of
the
litigants
in
the
district
court
to
refine
it
as
much
as
possible.
the
district
court
finally
said
this
is
what
i
order.
i
order
the
petitioners
not
to
file
any
dispositive
motions.
i
order
the
petitioners
to
respond
to
the
discovery,
to
reply
to
nonprivileged
discovery
requests
and
assert
executive
privilege,
which
we
are
saying--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
we
did
not.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
strong
case
that
it
should
be,
justice
souter.
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
this
issue,
too,
and
said,
well,
the
district
court
might
have
been
too
broad.
in
fact,
the
circuit
court,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
the
constitutional
implications
and
then
said,
but
maybe
that
can
be
narrowed
down,
but
that
the
respondents
should
be
entitled
to
whatever
discovery
they
need
to
prove
their
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
was...
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
did,
mr.
chief
justice,
although
it
did
say
that
the
government
could
assert
privileges
with
respect
to
burden
or
executive
privilege,
and
so
forth.
but
if
one
looks
at
those
discovery
orders
and
they
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
they
were
much
broader
than
the
statute
itself,
broader
than
the
relief
that
possibly
could--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--inevitably
what
would
have
happened,
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and
this
is
at
petition
appendix
18-a
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
that
however
refined
the
district
court's
order
would
be,
they
would
be,
the
respondents
would
be
entitled
to
whatever
discovery
they
needed
to
prove
their
case.
now,
what
they
need
to
prove
their
case,
notwithstanding
the
presumption
of
regularity
that
the
court
has
always
applied
to
the
executive,
absent
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary,
there
is
no
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary
here,
justice
ginsburg.
all
there
is
is
a
pure
unadorned
allegation
which
the
respondents
say
they
get
from
media
reports
that
there
were
contacts,
nothing
beyond
that.
but
what
they
would
need
to
prove,
to
prove
their
case
is
precisely
what
the
district
court
was
going
to
allow
them
to
utilize.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
the
form
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--both,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
fits
squarely
within
nixon.
when
the
court
said
to
require
the
president,
and
remember,
we
are
talking
about
the
president
as
the
real
party
in
interest,
to
place
himself
in
the
posture
of
disobeying
a
court
order,
merely
to
trigger
the
procedural
mechanism.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
president--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--when
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
certainly
does
when
it
involves
the
president
or
the
vice
president
in
core
constitutional
functions.
and
u.s.
vs.
nixon
stands
for
the
proposition
when
the
president
must
choose
between
submission
to
an
unconstitutional
order,
which
participation
in
this
discovery,
the
process
of
participation,
having
to
prove
every
time
the
president
consults
with
someone,
to
submit
to
litigation,
and
potentially
submit
to
discovery,
to
submit
to
the
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers,
or,
or
violate
or
challenge
either
sanctions
or
some
order
from
the
district
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice
breyer--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
believe
that
it's
much
broader
than
executive--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
the
act
of
forcing
the
president
to
invoke
executive
privilege
every
time
someone
files
a
lawsuit,
notwithstanding
the
presumption
of
regularity
which
was
completely
ignored
here,
that
means
that
faca
would
be
used
in
every
case
to
file
a
lawsuit
to
challenge
the
president
and
the
vice
president's
ability
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--to
obtain
opinions--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--potentially,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
the
government
was
anxious...
because
there
was
another
way
to
resolve
this
whole
problem,
notwithstanding
the
denial
of
the
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
submit
that
what
the
government
did
here
was
try
to
work
out
the
delicate
constitutional
problems
that
were
involved
here,
the
balancing
of
the
executive's
prerogative
with
the
litigation
function
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
to
go
the
extra
mile.
i
don't
think
the
court
would
want
to
encourage
filing
a
mandamus
or
collateral
order
appeals
every
time
there
is
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
precisely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
forcing
of
the
president
to
submit
to
litigation
and
discovery,
which
if
permitted
in
this
case
could
be
in
any
case
comparable
to
it,
any
time
advice
is
being
sought
from
a
citizen
or
from
subordinates
who
may
have
then
talked
to
citizens,
notwithstanding
the
clear
four
corners
of
the
directive
when
the
president
created
the
body
within
his
own
administration
from
which
he
sought
advice,
every
time
there
would
be
a
lawsuit,
every
time
they
would
say,
well,
mr.
president,
come
into
court
and
claim
executive
privilege.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
is
two
answers
to
that,
one
which
the
chief
justice
suggested
in
his
question.
executive
privilege
may
not
have
covered
every
scrap
of
paper.
it
would
have
required
the
president
and
the
vice
president
to
spend
time
with
documents
deciding
whether
or
not
to
assert
executive
privilege.
and
it
is
the
process...
more
importantly
than
that,
it
is
the
process
itself
of
submitting,
as
it
would
be
if
someone,
if
the
congress
had
applied
this
statute
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
or
even
to
itself,
and
then
allowed
litigants
to
bring
the
court
or
members
of
congress
into
court
to
explain
why
they
wouldn't
produce
information
with
respect
to
who
they
talked
to.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
there
are
several
differences,
justice
kennedy.
as
i
said
at
the
very
beginning,
this
discovery
dispute
involves
bringing
the
president
and
the
vice
president
of
the
united
states
into
court
to
defend
themselves
with
respect
to
textually
committed
obligations
and
responsibilities
that
they
have
under
the
constitution.
every
other
discovery
dispute
that
i
have
experienced,
and
i
submit
this
court
has
experienced
except
for
perhaps
u.s.
vs.
nixon,
maybe
another
case,
did
not
involve
those
circumstances.
this
is
at...
this
puts
the
president,
in
order
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
process
that's
invasive
to
fundamental
presidential
prerogatives
and
responsibilities
into
court
to
defend
himself,
notwithstanding
the
questionable
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that
triggers
it,
that
mandamus
may
not
be
brought
against
the
vice
president
which
is
the...
the
federal
advisory
committee
act,
it's
worth
mentioning,
does
not
create
a
private
right
of
action.
the
apa
did
not
create
a
right
of
action
against
the
vice
president
here.
so
the
litigants
in
this
case,
not
having
a
right
to
even
bring
this
case
under
the
statute,
then
sought
mandamus,
it's
important
to
mention.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
one,
the
agencies
occupy
a
different
statute
under
the
apa.
they
occupy
a
different
position
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
therefore,
the
obligations
were
different
with
respect
to
the
president's
core
function.
arguments--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
mr....
justice
scalia,
they
would
have
been
arguably
available
under
foia,
and
they
were
produced
under
foia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
was
more
than
one
action,
justice
ginsburg.
there
were
several
foia
actions
brought
against
the
various
different
departments.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
but
the
documents
having
already
been
produced
and
made
available
to
the
public
under
foia,
it
seemed
to
the
government
that
would
be
foolhardy
and
unnecessarily
confrontational
and
would
serve
no
purpose
whatsoever
to
withhold
producing
another
set
of
those
documents.
again,
this
is
effort--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they
were
produced
by
agencies.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
i
was
going
to
address
that
point
because
it's
been
addressed
by
justice
souter,
justice
stevens,
justice
kennedy.
what
the
discovery...
and
i
don't
have
time
to
read
the
interrogatories
or
the
requests
for
admissions,
but
those
require
the
production
of
all
information
with
respect
to
any
contacts
at
all
between
any
member
of
the
task
force
or
any
government
employee
that
assisted
with
it
or
any
agency--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
those
were
the
discovery
and
requests
for
admissions.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
refine
that.
it
said
that,
well,
that's
pretty
broad,
and
it
should
be
narrowed
down,
but
it
should
be
whatever
is
necessary
to
prove
their
case.
they
thought
what
was
necessary
to
prove
their
case
was
to
have
all
outside
contacts.
faca
does
not
require
the
production
of
that
degree
or
that
scope
of
documents.
it
has
to
do
with
minutes
and
drafts
and
things
that
were
actually
considered
by
the
committee.
so
the
discovery
is
vastly
broader
than
the
relief
that
would
be
available
if
faca
existed.
secondly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
of
course.
but
that's
exactly
what
those
requests
for
admissions
in
those
interrogatories
seek.
all
contacts
between
any
member
of
the
committee
or
any
other
government
employee
and
any
outside
person.
and
then
what
judge
tattle
and
what...
went
on
to
say
at
page
18-a,
that
is
to
say
the
discovery
they
need
to
prove
their
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
different,
but
it...
everything
that
they
have
asked
for
in
those
requests
for
admissions
and
those
interrogatories,
justice
breyer,
include
everything
they
would
get
under
faca
and
a
whole
lot
more.
so...
and
there
is
no
question
about
that.
now,
with
respect
to
the
subordinate
working
groups,
a
point
was
made
with
respect
to
the
president's
directive,
that
the
president
said
the
vice
president
may
establish
subordinate
working
groups
to
assist.
the
declaration
that's
in
the
file
at
page
240
of
the
joint
appendix
specifically
says
that
the
vice
president
authorized
that,
but
the
vice
president
did
not
establish
any
such
subordinate
working
groups.
and
then
the
declaration
goes
on
to
say
that
there
was
only
a
public
citizen
that
was
involved
in
developing
graphics
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and
that
was
the
only
person
that
was
involved.
no
such
individuals,
the
individuals
named
in
the
litigation,
participated
in
the
working
group
formulation.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
constitutional
immunity
from
discovery
that
we
are
talking
about
here
is
rooted
in
the
overriding
presumption
of
regularity,
which,
if
repealed
in
this
case,
would
repeal...
if
overridden
in
this
case
would
repeal
the
exemption
under
faca
for
all
government
working
groups.
and
these
are
exclusive
functions,
textually
committed
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
getting
opinions
from
his
subordinates.
as
your
question
suggested,
justice
breyer,
virtually
anything
that
the
president
might
do,
asking
the
attorney
general
or
the
assistant
attorney
general
for
this
or
that
to
formulate
something,
and
they
go
out
to
talk
to
people,
that
could
be
a...
that
would
be
a
faca
lawsuit
in
a
heartbeat.
there
is
no
statute
that
creates
the
right
that
the
petitioners
seek
here.
there
is
no,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
under
faca,
and
there
is,
no,
justice
stevens,
no
clear
remedy,
no
clear
right
to
which
they
are
entitled
to
ministerial
duty
and
therefore
a
remedy.
and
they
just
jumped
over
the
fact
that
the
statute
didn't
give
them
the
right
to
bring
this
case
and
brought
it
in
the
form
of
mandamus.
mandamus
is
no
substitute.
it's
not
appropriate
here.
it's
a
pure
circumvention
of
the
statute.
there
is,
we
submit,
no
such
thing
as
a
de
facto
member
of
an
advisory
group
under
faca.
faca
was
intended
to
address
the
creation
of
de
jure
working
groups
where
the
president
would
cloak
himself
in
the
benefit
of
public
citizens
who
have
come
up
with
this
proposal.
it's
not,
i
think
your
question,
justice
breyer,
it's
not
a
foia
case.
it's
not
a--
