mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
threshold
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
ruled
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
over
petitioners'
attempt
to
obtain
interlocutory
review
of
the
district
court's
order.
in
seeking
review
in
this
court,
petitioners
paint
the
picture
of
having
been
backed
into
a
corner.
they
claim
that
if
they
do
not
obtain
immediate
appellate
review
that
they
will
lose
all
meaningful
opportunity
to
obtain
review
of
the
legal
positions
that
they
have
taken
in
the
district
court.
the
basis
for
this
claim,
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
is
united
states
against
nixon.
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
distinguished
that
case,
and
said
that
under
neither
mandamus
or
the
collateral
order
was
review
proper.
the
petitioners--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
they
certainly
made
that
observation,
but
that
was
not
the
only
reason
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
some
question
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
can
be
read
in
that
regard.
we
do
not
rely
on
the
fact
that
executive
privilege
was
not
claimed
because
here
the
government's
position
is
that
no
discovery
of
any
kind
whatsoever,
other
than
the
previously
produced
documents,
is
available
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
thought
i
had
been
pretty
clear
in
my
brief
saying
that
executive
privilege
was
certainly
something
that
could
be
claimed
down
the
road.
and
we
certainly...
the
district
judge
had
not
precluded
that
from
happening.
but
as
far
as
we
were
concerned--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
makes
no
difference.
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
that
would
require
accepting
the
notion
that...
that
everything
else
that
they
can...
they
can
refuse
to
turn
over
everything
else,
which
is
essentially
their
position
here.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
is
very
clear,
no
discovery,
period,
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
united
states
against
nixon
as
to
whether
that
decision
agrees
with
your
honor's
interpretation,
we
don't
have
to
get
to
that
issue
in
this
case,
and...
and
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
read
the
government's
brief
as
being
that
narrow.
but
to
the
extent
that
what
they
are
saying
is
that
they
have
some
kind
of
special
immunity
from
discovery,
it
would,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested
earlier,
have
been
perfectly
apparent
the
day
of
july
11th
when
the
court
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
ordered
that
discovery
is
going
to
take
place.
that
that
was
the
time
in
which
the
government
should
have
taken
an
appeal
if
they
claimed
some
sort
of
immunity
like--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
your
honor,
but...
the
notion
that
there
is
a
special
kind
of
immunity
from
discovery
of
the
president
and
vice
president,
a
situation
like
this
which
is
what
i
understand
their
argument
to
be,
that's
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
immunity
defense
for
which
there
is
an
exception
under
the
collateral
order
rule.
i
disagree
with
the
merits
of
that,
but
if
that's
their
argument,
that's
when
they
should
have
taken
the
appeal.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
nothing
has
happened
of
any
legal
significance
in
the
case
from
that
time
on.
the
solicitor
general
said
the
government
was
trying
to
work
things
out.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
with
all
respect--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--with
all
respect,
your
honor,
if
you
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
principal
grounds
on
which
the
district
court
refused
to
dismiss
the
case
was
that
discovery
was
required
both
with
respect
to
the
de
facto
officer
issue
and
with
respect
to--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
the
government,
your
honor,
had
offered
in
evidence
the
executive
order
creating
the
task
force
and
a
copy
of
the
final
report.
the
knutson
affidavit
did
not
come
in
until
three
months
later.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
if
your
honors
will
look--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--we
can
get
a
declaration
that
it
was...
that
de
facto
has
to
apply.
we
then
get
access
to
all
the
drafts.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
what
we
get...
some
of
the
things
we
would
have
gotten--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--we
get
copies
of
all
the
papers
that
were
exchanged
in
the
entire
advisory
committee
process.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
have
asked
for
document...
for
discovery
requests
which
the
government
contends
are
very
broad
and
could
include
some
of
those
things.
our
discovery
plan--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--they
could
be
interpreted
as
being
right,
but
not
in
light
of
what
the
district
court
said
in
his
order
denying
the
motion
to
dismiss.
he
said,
we
are
going
to
have
very
narrow,
tailored
discovery
designed
to
find
out
first
and
foremost
is
the
de
facto
officer
applicable.
if
you
look
at
our
plan
of
discovery,
which
is
in
the
joint--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
comes
from
a
case
that
was
decided
in
the
d.c.
circuit
in
1993.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
oh,
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
it
was
alleged
that...
the
first
place,
the
hillary
clinton
task
force
was
composed
entirely
of
government
employees
and
the
working
subgroups
were
also
composed
entirely
of
government
employees.
the
first
question
was,
was
the
first
lady
a
government
employee.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
they
were
found
sufficiently
unclear
that
the
court
of
appeals
sent
the
matter
back
for
discovery.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
not
in
the
order
appointing
the
committee,
your
honor.
but
we
do
contend
that
the
subgroups--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--which
were
specifically
authorized--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
is
arguably
different.
but
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested
earlier,
since
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
one
who
created
this
doctrine
to
begin
with,
it
would
seem
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
try
to
distinguish
this
case
from
that
one
on
the
basis
of
when
we,
a,
don't
have
a
record,
and
b,
when
the
court
of
appeals
had
never
been
allowed
to
pass
on
that
particular
issue.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no.
it
hadn't
done
anything,
your
honor.
it
has
not
ruled
on
that
doctrine
in
this
case
at
all.
it
hasn't
reached
the
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
nothing
but
jurisdiction.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
didn't
say
prohibiting,
your
honor.
i
said
in
the
exercise
of
your
discretion,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
allow
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
instance
to
pass
on
it.
judge
randolph,
by
the
way,
justice
stevens,
thought
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
the
only
way
he
could
distinguish
the
two
cases
was
to
overrule
the
prior
decision.
he
may
or
may
not
be
right,
but
it
suggests
to
me--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
is
partially--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--all
right.
two
responses.
first,
to
some
extent,
it
is
an
open
government
statute
because
part
of
the
relief
under
faca
is
getting
access
to
all
the
documents
that
the
committee
prepares,
including
its
minutes.
second
is
that
this
statute
does
not
apply,
except
to
committees.
a
committee
under
the
public
citizen
case
requires
a
substantial
level
of
formality.
we
concede
that
both
this
committee
and
the
executive
office
of
the
president
and
anyone
else
can
call
anyone
they
want
at
any
time
without
triggering
faca.
only
if
you
have
a
formalized
committee
and
if
you
bring
people
in
to
participate
in
the
same
manner
as
other
committee
members--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that,
your
honor,
i
suggest
is
a
question
of
law
as
to
whether
voting
is
required,
but
we
believe
that
if
outsiders
participated
in
the
marking
up
of
drafts,
they
had
input
into
the
drafts,
particularly
at
the
subgroup
level,
even
though
they
had
no
formal
vote--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--they
were--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--they
did
lose
the
exception,
your
honor,
because
they
were
full-time
government
employees.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is
certainly
a
plausible
interpretation,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
the
statute
says
the
exception
is
composed
of,
wholly
composed
of
full-time
government
employees.
congress
was
well
aware
of
this
problem
and
it
decided
that
it
wanted
to
have
a
very
narrow
exception.
at
least
it's
an
arguable
basis
and
we
are
now
here
on
interlocutory
appeal
without
any
facts
in
the
record
whatsoever
as
to
how
these
committees
operated,
how
the
subgroup
operated.
they
may
have
had
a
vote
at
the
subgroup
level.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--they
were
appointed.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
a
quote
from
the
staff
director's
affidavit,
which
appears
in
the,
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
76.
he
admits,
and
the
government
admits,
that
there
were
substantial
numbers
of
meetings
between
outside
people
and
the
task
force.
the
question
is
what
happened
at
those
meetings,
and
that's
what
we
seek
discovery.
this
is
not
simply
an
allegation.
the
general
accounting
office--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--your
honor,
we
would
get
properly
reined
in
discovery,
as
the
district
court
understood
it,
we
would
get
the
basic
information
about
who
went
to
the
meetings,
who
had
access
to
the
drafts,
whether
anybody
had
the
right
to
vote.
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding,
that's
all
the
discovery
we
think
we
are
entitled
to.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
do
not
think
that
the
government
has
any
right
to
withhold
that
kind
of
information
in
this
kind
of
case.
and
if
the
government
makes--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
and
if
the
government
asserts
that
it
has
the
right
to
withhold
that
information,
it
may
continue
to
assert
that
right.
the
district
court
will
then
proceed
under
rule
37,
enter
an
order
against
it.
it
can
then
take
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
and
the
question--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no.
that
is
correct.
and
get...
the
question
is,
should
we
try
to
anticipate
what
the
district
court,
district
judge
will
do.
