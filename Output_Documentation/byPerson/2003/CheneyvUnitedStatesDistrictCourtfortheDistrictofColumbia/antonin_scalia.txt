but
what
if
it's,
what
if
it's...
what
if
the
manner
in
which
it's
utilized
is
that,
in
fact,
outsiders,
nongovernment
employees,
were
actually
given
a
vote,
that
when
the
committee
took
a
vote,
there
were
some
nongovernment
employees
who
were
counted?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is,
this
is
more
than
ex
parte
communications.
it's
that
the
committee
is
in
fact,
as
utilized,
not
a
committee
composed
exclusively
of
government
employees.
all
i'm
saying
is
the
people
voting,
the
people
voting,
why
would
that
be
such
an
intrusion
upon
the
executive?
simply
to
require
knowledge
of
whether
anybody
that
voted
on
the
various
recommendations
of
the
commission
was
a
nongovernment
employee.
why
would
that
be
such
a
terrible--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
those
documents
that
were
turned
over
were,
as
i
recall,
documents
that
would
have
been
available
under
foia,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
of
appeals
based
that,
as
i
recall,
on
the
fact
that
in
nixon,
executive
privilege
had
been
asserted,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
surprised
to
hear
that.
i
was,
i
was
going
to
talk
to
you
about
executive
privilege,
because
i
thought
that
your
briefs
did
rely
on
the
fact
that
executive
privilege
was
not
claimed,
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
very
significant
factor.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
should
make
no
difference
to
the
outcome
of
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
also
require
acceptance
of
the
position
that
executive
privilege
is
a
definable
doctrine
only
applicable
to
certain
matters,
and
that
it
is,
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
to
decide
what
it
can
be
asserted
for
and
what
it
can't
be
asserted
for.
and
that
is
not
my
view
of
executive
privilege.
i
think
executive
privilege
means
whenever
the
president
feels
that
he
is
threatened,
he
can
simply
refuse
to
comply
with
a
court
order.
and
the
same
thing
with
congress.
and
it
ends
up
in
a,
you
know,
a
struggle
of
the
two
branches.
i
don't
view
that
as
some
legal
doctrine
that
enables
him
to
withhold
certain
documents.
he
is,
he
has
the
power
as
an
independent
branch
to
say,
no,
this
intrudes
too
much
upon
my
powers,
i
will
not
do
it.
and
after
that,
it's
a,
it's
a
struggle
between
two
branches.
and
if
you
view
executive
privilege
that
way,
forcing
him
to
assert
executive
privilege
is
really
pushing
things
to
an
extreme
that
should
not
very
often
occur
in
this
republic.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
morrison--
justice

discovery
order.
that's
significant.
the
mere
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
did
not
automatically
determine
that
there
would
be
a
discovery
order.
the
court,
the
court
might
have
found,
in
accordance
with
the
arguments
of
the
government,
that
discovery
would
be
inappropriate.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
that
is
a
new
injury
to
the,
to
the
executive
which
they
are
trying
to
bring
up
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
require
voting.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have...
i
have
always
been
puzzled
by
that
in
your
briefs,
to
participate
in
the
same
manner
as
other
committee
members.
it
seems
to
me
the
essence
of
being
a
committee
member
is
having
a
vote
in
the
outcome.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
only
discovery
you
would
need
is
discovery
as
to
whether
anybody
who
was
not
a
government
employee
voted.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
if
i
bring
somebody
else
from
my
agency
with
me,
i
expect
all
of
these
cabinet
members
didn't
come
to
the
meetings
alone.
they
certainly
had
assistants
with
them.
were
those
assistants
members
of
the
committee?
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
asking
whether
they
lost
the
exception.
i'm
asking
whether
they
were
members
of
the
committee,
and
the
answer
has
to
be
no.
now,
suppose
i
bring
instead
of
another
government
employee
with
me
to
give
me
advice,
i
bring
a
private
individual
with
me
to
give
me
advice.
suddenly,
that
private
member
becomes...
private
individual
becomes
a
member
of
the
committee
even
though
a
government
agency
member--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
plausible
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
involvement
of
private
individuals
in
the
task
force
does
not
equate
with
membership
of
private
individuals
in
the
task
force,
and
i
wonder
what
your
view
is
about
the
question
that
i
asked
to
mr.
morrison.
what,
what
is
it
that
makes
you
a
de
facto
member?
it
surely
can't
be
just
sitting
there
next
to
somebody
else
who
is
even
at
a
full
committee
meeting.
it
can't
be
sitting
next
to
the
cabinet
member.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
well,
that
case
may
be
wrong.
what
is
it
that
makes
you
de
facto
member?
what...
i
assume
it's
the
same
thing
that
makes
you
a
member,
that
is
the
power
to
determine
the
action
the
committee
will
take.
that
is
the
power
to
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is.
the
vote.
let's
assume
that's
the
only
thing
that
distinguishes
them,
the
vote.
isn't
that
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
more
than
that,
you
are
not
talking
about
de
facto
members.
you
are
talking
about
de
facto
participants,
and
that's
a
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
those
subgroups
would
report
to
the
full
committee,
i
assume,
they
would
not
have
any
dispositive
authority
over
what
the
report
of
the
committee
says,
would
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
are
called
subgroups,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
indicate
that
they
are
under
somebody.
and
i
gather
what
they
are
under
is
the
committee.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine.
i
don't
care
who
they
report
to.
they
are
not
the
committee.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
does
that...
i
don't
see
how
that's--
