mr.
conrad
hafen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
reasons
why
compelling
a
lawfully
detained
person
to
identify
himself
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
a
minimal
intrusion.
it
advances
officer
safety,
and
it
promotes
effective
law
enforcement
in
the
prevention
and
detection
of
crime.
furthermore,
it
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
because
identifying
yourself
is
a
neutral
act.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
in
regard--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--well,
your
honor,
in
regard
to
byers,
it
was
a
plurality
opinion,
but
there
was
also
a
strong
concurrence
by
justice
harlan.
and
in
that
particular
case,
they
talk
about
stating
a
name
and
address
as
being
a
neutral
act,
and
in
the
same
context,
they
talked
about
it
in
regard
to
a
testimonial
situation.
they
talk
about
it's
a
testimonial
situation
or
a
non-testimonial
situation
when
a
person
is
stopped,
the
mere
stopping
of
the
car,
but
in
the
same
context,
they
also
say
stating
your
name
and
your
address
is
a
neutral
act.
mr.
conrad
hafen
they
did
talk
about
that,
your
honor,
but
in
the
same
context,
they
also
describe
or
they...
they
address
it
in
the
criminal
context.
the
plurality
opinion
addresses
it
in
the
criminal
context,
and
justice
harlan
also
addresses
it
in
the
plurality...
or--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--that's
correct.
mr.
conrad
hafen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that...
that
goes
to
the
incriminating
part
of
it,
but
when
they
talk
about
the
neutral
act,
we're
interpreting
that
to
go
to
the
testimonial
part
of
it.
and
this
court
traditionally
treats
names
differently.
mr.
conrad
hafen
your
honor,
the
statute
in
nevada
doesn't
go
that
far.
it
simply
says
compelling...
the...
the
identification
or
to
identify
one's
self.
so
under
the
nevada
statute,
those
type
of
identifiers--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--you
could
certainly
make
the
argument
that
those
other
things
that
you
suggested,
your
honor,
are
neutral.
however,
going
back
to
the
fourth
amendment,
they
really
don't
serve
the
purpose
of
officer
safety.
it's
the
name
that
you
need
so
that
you
can
discover
who
this
person
is,
what
their
background
is--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--well,
your
honor,
going
outside
the
record,
based
on
my
experience
as
a
prosecutor,
that
information
can
be
received
in
just
a...
a
matter
of
minutes.
and
so
while
the
officer
is
waiting
for
that
information,
he
can
certainly
take
the
posture
of
protecting
himself.
however,
after
receiving
that
information
and
obtaining
the
criminal
history
on
this
person...
perhaps
he
has
a...
a
history
of
battery
on
police
officers...
he
can
then
escalate
protection.
he
either
calls
for
backup
or
perhaps
unholsters
his...
his
revolver.
he
has
a
number
of
things
that
he
can
do
after
he
gets
that
information.
and
so
it
is
critical.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--that
certainly
adds
into
the
equation,
your
honor,
but
that
in
and
of
itself
wouldn't
convert
into
probable
cause.
the
officer
would
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
on
review
of--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--well,
again,
i...
i
don't
believe
so
because
there
would
be
other
factors
that
would...
would
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
conrad
hafen
no.
mr.
conrad
hafen
under
your
hypothetical,
yes.
mr.
conrad
hafen
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
conrad
hafen
excuse
me?
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
your
honor,
two
responses.
first
of
all,
i
believe
that
reference
in
berkemer
is...
is
dicta
by
the
court.
the
real
holding
in
berkemer
was
a
miranda
issue.
second,
this
court
has
never
specifically
addressed
this
question.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
in
subsequent
opinions
that
were
cited
by
the
petitioner,
they
discuss
the...
either
a
dissent
or
a
concurring,
and
in
those
particular
references,
the
justice
does
say
unsolved
crimes,
questions
to
unsolved
crimes,
or
as
justice
white
said--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--because
again,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
in
this
particular
issue
where
it's
a
stop
and
identify
statute,
that
the
court
has
specifically
addressed
that.
mr.
conrad
hafen
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
conrad
hafen
in
berkemer
v.
mccarty.
mr.
conrad
hafen
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
when
the
court
would
engage
in
a
balancing
test.
and
the
court
traditionally
has
balanced--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--that's
correct.
mr.
conrad
hafen
that's
correct.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
are
you...
in
regard
to
berkemer?
mr.
conrad
hafen
in
regard
to
berkemer,
again
that
went
back
to
a
miranda
issue,
whether
an
individual...
whether
an
officer
would
have
to
read
miranda
to
a...
during
a
traffic
stop.
and--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--that...
that's
correct.
the
court
ultimately
decided
that
a
traffic
stop
was
akin
to
a
terry
stop.
but
the
court
also
addressed
it
in
the
situation
of
a
fifth
amendment
issue
under
a...
a
miranda
concept.
mr.
conrad
hafen
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
know.
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the...
the
opinion
simply
addresses
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
why
they
didn't
address
the...
the
fifth
amendment
i
don't
know.
those...
those
issues
were
certainly
presented
to
that
court.
mr.
conrad
hafen
to...
to
some
extent,
your
honor.
but
again,
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
testimonial
and
it's
not
incriminating.
it's
simply--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--that...
that's
correct.
and
in
regard
to
the
fourth
amendment,
again
it
gets
back
to
this
balancing
issue.
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
balance
the...
any
apparent
personal
security
interests
of
mr.
hiibel
against
the
important
legitimate
interests
that
the
government
has
in
this
case.
and
again,
it
gets
back
to
officer
safety.
it
gets
back
to
the
prevention
and
detection
of
crime.
and
again--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
the
deputy
did
warn
him.
in
fact,
the
evidence
is
clear
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
4
that
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
justice
court
was
that
deputy
dove
did
tell
mr.
hiibel
if
you
don't
give
me
identification,
i'm
going
to
have
to
arrest
you.
mr.
conrad
hafen
and
so
in
this
particular
case,
he
was
placed
on
notice--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--that...
that's
correct.
the
statute
does
say,
shall
identify
yourself.
mr.
conrad
hafen
that's
correct.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
to
some
extent,
but
going
back
to
the
videotape
that...
that
the
court
has,
after
deputy
dove
asked
the...
or
informed
mr.
hiibel,
i'm
here
because
of
a
fight
between
the
two
of
you,
he
indicates,
i
know
nothing
about
that.
so
that
may
very
well
take
him
somewhat
out
of
the
class
of
a
suspect
now
to
a
potential
witness.
at
that
time,
deputy
dove,
based
on
that
response,
doesn't
know
now,
well,
is
this
the
man
that
was
reported
hitting
the
woman
in
the
truck
or
did
that
person
leave
and
this
is
simply
another
passenger
in
the
truck.
so
viewed
objectively,
he
has
every
right
or...
to...
to
ask
the
question
and
because
it
wouldn't
constitute
a
fifth
amendment
violation
in
that
context
if
mr.
hiibel
truly
was
a
witness,
then
he
would
be
obligated
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
conrad
hafen
it
would
be
byers,
and
we
rely
upon
byers.
and
again,
granted,
it's
a
plurality
decision
but
with
a
strong
concurrence
by
justice
harlan.
mr.
conrad
hafen
in...
in
that
context,
yes,
because
now
he,
according
to
deputy
dove,
viewed
objectively,
is
potentially
a...
a
witness.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
but
the
reasonable
suspicion
was
formed
prior
to
meeting
with...
with
mr.
hiibel.
so
he
had
every...
at
least
he
had
the
reasonable
suspicion
for
initially
detaining.
mr.
conrad
hafen
during...
first
of
all,
you
have
to
make
sure
that
there's
reasonable
suspicion
to
detain
the
person
and
at
that
point
then
when
the
officer
asks
the
person
for
identification
or
what
his
name
is,
then
if
the
person
doesn't
respond,
then
the
person
can
be
arrested.
mr.
conrad
hafen
oh,
they...
they
certainly
could
demand
at
that
point.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
it
depends
if
at
that
time
there's
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
one
of
those
individuals
may
have
committed
a
crime.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
again,
it's...
it's
going
to
depend
on
the...
the
search...
the
situation.
mr.
conrad
hafen
right.
the
statute
is
specifically
tied
into
reasonable
suspicion
and
whether
that
person
may
have
committed
a
crime.
i
agree,
yes.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
again,
let...
let
me
back
up.
mr.
conrad
hafen
yes.
mr.
conrad
hafen
well,
they
do--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that's
a
very
vague
response,
and
i
think
they'd
have
to
specifically
invoke
the
fifth
amendment.
and
as...
justice
scalia,
as
you
pointed
out,
typically
when
they
do
that,
they
do
that
in
the
context
of
maybe
a
grand
jury
hearing
or...
or
a
criminal
trial.
and
so,
again,
the
state's
position
in...
in
regard
to
this
particular
case
is
that
as
it
relates
to
the
fifth
amendment,
is
the
name
itself
is
a
neutral
act.
it
simply
doesn't
implicate
an
individual
in
any
criminal
conduct.
it
doesn't
say
in
this
particular
case
in
regard
to
mr.
hiibel,
that
he
struck
the
woman.
it
doesn't
even
imply
that
he
may
have
been
driving
the
car.
it
doesn't
go
to
any--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--well,
that
would
certainly
go
to
the
wade
and
the
gilbert
cases
that
talk
about
voice
analysis,
lineup--
mr.
conrad
hafen
--thank
you.
