mr.
robert
e.
dolan
your
honor,
it's
hiibel.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
here
today
to
respectfully
ask
this
honorable
court
to
find
that
the
search
and
seizure
of
my
client
was
illegal
and
unreasonable
and,
in
the
process,
to
reverse
my
client's
conviction.
petitioner
hiibel
was
arrested
and
convicted
of
a
crime
simply
because
he
did
not
identify
himself
or
provide
identity.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
this
was
not
a
traffic
stop.
this
was
a...
an
interaction
between
a
pedestrian
and
a
law
enforcement
officer,
wherein
the
officer--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--no,
your
honor.
there
was
never
a
finding
of
fact
on
that
issue.
in
fact,
the
issue
before
the
trier
of
fact
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
court
there
in
winnemucca
was
whether
or
not
the...
the
charge
of
resisting
and
delaying
the
officer
occurred.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes.
when
deputy
dove
arrived
at
the
scene,
mr.
hiibel
was
standing
at
the
passenger
side
of
the
car.
his
daughter
was
in
the
cab
of
the
truck
by
the...
the
steering
wheel.
and
when
deputy
dove
arrived
on
the
scene,
he
began
the
police-citizen
encounter
with
mr.
hiibel.
they
approached
each
other.
deputy
dove
said,
i
heard
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
fight.
mr.
hiibel
said,
i
don't
know
anything
about
that.
deputy
dove
then
proceeded
to
ask
approximately
11
times
for
mr.
hiibel
to
provide
identification.
let
me
see
id.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
reasonable
basis
for
that
question
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
well,
we
believe
that
the
deputy
certainly
had
the
right
to
ask
for
identity
and...
and
we
think
equally
so
mr.
hiibel
was
free
not
to
respond.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
the--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--well,
we...
we
certainly
believe
that
under
the
fifth
amendment
a
person
has
no
obligation
to
respond
to...
to
that
officer.
the...
the
citizen
never
knows
whether
or
not
the
encounter
is
a
consensual
encounter
where
he
certainly
has
no
obligation
to
speak
or
do
anything.
he...
in
fact,
he
can
freely
terminate
the
encounter
at
any
time.
now,
there
is,
under
your
honor's
question,
a
terry
stop.
certainly
the
citizen
doesn't
know
that.
the
officer
does
presumably,
and
if
that
terry
stop
was
to
evolve
into
a
probable
cause
circumstance--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--just
a
terry
stop.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
the
officer
is
allowed
to
make--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--we
certainly
don't
believe
that
the
government
can
criminalize
the
non-response
which
the
statute
in
this
case
does,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
not
lawfully.
i
believe
that
the
court
certainly
allows,
if
there
is
independent
bases
to
conclude
that
the
officer...
that
the
subject
is
armed,
the
officer
is
lawful
in
using
force
to
apply
a
patdown
search.
and
if
a
person
resisted
that,
then
that
would
be
a
basis
for
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
relation
to
the
state
that
free
citizens
have
prevent
the
state
from
imposing
obligations,
affirmative
obligations,
to
terminate
the
citizen-police
encounter.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
the...
yes,
your
honor.
the...
the
privacy
concept
that
the
fourth
amendment
addresses
certainly
allows
a
person
to
be
free
from
an
illegal
search.
we
believe
that
when
the
government
is
attempting
to
extract
data
from
a
person
without
probable
cause,
it
is
improper.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
your
honor,
the...
the
name
is
not
neutral,
certainly
in
this
domestic
battery
terry
stop,
because
the
name
itself--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--your
honor,
there
are
numerous
instances
where
one's
name
is
not
a
neutral
fact.
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
criminal
investigation
was
to
determine
if
a
domestic
battery
had
occurred.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes,
your
honor.
certainly
there
are
numerous
investigative
tools
available
to
the
police,
including
running
the
license
plate.
in
fact,
deputy
dove--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--well,
we
certainly
believe
that
had
that
been
the
facts
in
the
case
and
mr.
hiibel
chose
not
to
respond,
there
would
not
be
a
basis
that's
proper
under
the
law
for
a
criminal
prosecution
in
that
regard,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
we
believe
that...
that
that
is
the
law,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
but
this
was
not
the
case.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
nor
was
it
relevant
at
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
it
was...
it
was
not
a
fact
that
was
deemed
relevant
by
the
state
at
the
time
or
the
defense.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
that
is--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
your
honor,
the
imposition
of
an
affirmative
duty
to
avoid
criminal
sanction
when
you
are
otherwise
innocent
of
any
crime
is
an
improper
tipping
of
balance
in
favor
of
the
state
at
the
expense
of
some
very--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--your
honor,
the
numerous
anonymous
activities
that
this
court
finds
to
be
important
to
the
maintenance
of
a
free
society
engaging--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--your
honor,
also
the
watchtower
line
of
cases,
religious
solicitation,
religious
door-to-door
activity.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
addressing
circumstances
where
a
citizen
also
is
left
at
the
mercy
of
the
discretion
of
an
officer.
no
citizen
can
safely
have
a
voluntary
interaction
with
an
officer
without
risking
arrest
because
there
was
no
obligation
in
the
law
for
the
officer
to
say,
as
a
result
of
you
telling
me
that
you
have
a
red
car,
i
now
determine
that
reasonable
suspicion
exists.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
we...
we
don't
believe
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
at
all
that
he
was
the
operator
of
the
car
and
there
would
have
been
no
lawful
basis
for
the--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
mr.
hiibel
was
standing
at
the
passenger
side
door
and
the--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--no,
your
honor.
there--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--the
daughter
was...
when
the
officer
arrived
behind
the
wheel.
she
eventually
slid
over
to
the
passenger
side
when
she
was...
towards
the
end
of
the
encounter,
she
exited
and
then
was
thrown
to
the
ground
and
arrested.
but--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--certainly.
i
believe
available
to
deputy
dove
at
the
time
was
to
do
what
he
was
there
to
do,
and
that
was
to
investigate
to
see
if
a
domestic
battery
had
occurred.
i
don't
believe
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
deputy
dove
engaged
in
the
best
or
worst
police
activity.
i
believe
the
issue
before
this
court...
and
with
respect
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
homeless
people
do
not
have
the
appropriate
residences,
permanent
residences,
and
accordingly
would
be
unable
to
provide
their
identification.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
in...
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
certainly
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
white
in
terry
itself
clearly
stated
that
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
a
person
is
not
obliged
to
respond
to--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--that
is
a
qualitatively
different
invasion
of
one's
privacy.
but
unless--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--well,
as
a--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--general
rule,
no.
there
may
be
some
exceptions.
this
court
has
addressed
the
possible
exceptions
like
being...
the
officer
knows
that
a
murder/rape
has
occurred,
fingerprints,
bloody
fingerprints,
were
found
at
the
scene,
there
was
independent
facts
to
tie
the
person
to
that
scene.
and
the
purpose
of...
of
a
fingerprint
would
be
to
confirm
or
dispel
that
officer's
specific
concern
about
the
possible
criminality
of
that
one
person,
and
the
court
has
indicated
that
that
may
be
appropriate.
but
that's
a
very...
that's...
was
limited
to
those
facts.
this
was
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
your
honor--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--we
believe
the
law
under
wardlow,
your
honor,
requires
that
unless
the
police
officer
is
able
to
escalate
his
basis
of
knowledge
to
probable
cause
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time
of
inquiry--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--we...
we--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--well,
the...
the
person
could
be
purchasing
jewelry
for
his
paramour
and...
and
he
does
not
want
his
wife
to
know.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
again,
i
believe
even
in
a
post-probable
cause
booking
procedure,
a
person
has
the
right
to
remain
silent
if
they
view
from
their
perspective...
and
i
believe
this
is
what
the
test
is.
rhode
island
v.
innis
would...
would
suggest
that.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes,
your
honor,
because
one's
name--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--well,
the...
the
fifth--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--your
honor,
the...
the
name
is
in
fact
testimonial
because
it
is
an
assertion
of
fact,
and
one
can
lie
about
one's
name,
and
accordingly,
i
think...
believe
the
test
of
what's
testimonial
or
not
is
met.
it's
also
incriminating
because
if
an
officer
determines
that
probable
cause
exists
that
a
domestic
battery
has
occurred,
that
officer
must
arrest
that
person.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes,
justice
stevens.
we
believe
that
a
certain...
any--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--that...
that...
i'm--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--the...
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
can
never
increase
one's
level
of--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--well,
we
certainly
believe
the
officer
can
ask.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
the
imposition
of
a
criminal
sanction
for
silence
is--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--well,
after...
post
probable
cause,
the
law
is
a
person
is
warned.
they
are
informed
of
their
right
to
remain
silent.
they
are
also
informed
of
other
constitutional
rights.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
well,
i
don't...
i
certainly
think
that
the
state's
case
about
the
lawfulness
of
an
arrest
and
a
conviction
is...
is
weaker
for
seizing
a
witness
who
exercises
their
right
to
remain
silent.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
well,
your
honor,
as
regards
the
byers
case,
that
statute
spoke
of
a
regulatory
scheme
in
which
the...
the
identity,
which
was
required
to
be
given,
was
not
to
a
member
of
law
enforcement.
it
was
to
the
owner
of
a
vehicle.
the
nevada
statute
in
question
specifically
contemplates
that
the
dialogue
occurs
within
a
criminal
investigation
in
a
terry
stop,
which
was
different
from
byers
certainly,
and
also
the
intent
of
the
statute
in
byers
was
just
to
ensure
that
civil
liabilities
would
be
satisfied.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the...
the
name
is
testimonial
and
incriminating
because
of
the
dynamic
of
the
nevada
statute
in
question.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
we
are,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
one
of
the
interests
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect
is
to
protect
people
who
place...
find
themselves
in
ambiguous
circumstances
where--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--their
silence
or
their
admission
could--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--indeed...
indeed,
everyone
who
was
asked.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
well,
the...
the...
from
the
perspective
of
petitioner
hiibel,
when
deputy
dove
said
to
him,
i...
i
hear
that
there
was
a
fight
here,
and
then
deputy
dove
started
making
inquiry
of
him,
i
think
it
was
reasonable
for
petitioner
hiibel
to
realize
that
at
this
time
he
was
facing
the
cruel
trilemma,
which
this
court
speaks
of,
and
in
fact
had--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--if
there
was
an
imposition
of
criminal
sanction
for
the
failure
to
respond--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--if
it's
not
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
refuse,
it's
your
right
to
be
let
alone
which
is--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--your
honor,
i...
the
question
is
only
affirmative
as
regards
the
fifth
amendment
if
the
state
was
to
criminalize
your
silence
in
respect
to
that
question.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
we...
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
the
court
rejected
the
motion
for
rehearing
on
that
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes.
your
honor,
it
was
raised
at
the
trial
level
through
the
citation
at
the
trial...
i
was
the
trial
attorney...
to
berkemer
v.
mccarty.
we...
i
appealed
to
the
justice...
excuse
me.
i
appealed
to
the
sixth
judicial
district
court
where
both
the
state
and
the
defendant
specifically
briefed
the
fifth
amendment
issues
and
argued
the
fifth
amendment
issues.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
where
the
court
will...
will
turn
on
that
question.
but
also
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment
inquiry,
a
name
is
such
that
a
person
has
a
legitimate
expectation
in
the
privacy
in
that
name,
otherwise
the
government
certainly
then
could
require
name
tags
and
perhaps
color
codes.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
if...
if
at
a
traffic
stop
a
request
for
a
name
is
made
by
an
officer
to
the
person
that
the
officer
knows
was
driving
the
vehicle,
i
believe
the
implied
consent
rule
would...
would
allow
for
the
properly
imposed
government
sanction
in
that...
in
that--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
the--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--your
honor,
the
issue
was
also
briefed
in
the
opening
brief
before
the
nevada
supreme
court.
the...
the
nevada
supreme
court
just
chose
not
to
address
it
in
their
opinion.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
within
the...
within
the
fourth
amendment
balancing
construct,
we
believe
that
the
government's
argument
that
officer
safety
is
served
by
requiring
a
person
to
utter
their
name
is
a
false
assumption.
truly
if
the
officer
is
stopping
machine
gun
harry
and
he
says,
oh,
i'm
john
smith,
and...
and
if
you
follow
the
government's
position,
then
the
officer
at
that
time
can
relax
his
guard,
thereby
increasing
the...
the
possibility
of
danger.
so
we
think
that
as
the
court
engages
in
the
analysis
of
what
is
appropriate
under
the
balancing--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--i'm
saying
that
the...
what...
the
government's
argument
is
based
upon
the
assumption
that
everyone
will
tell
the
truth
during
a
terry
stop,
and
i
don't
believe
that
corresponds
with
common
sense,
especially
if
machine
gun
harry
is
there.
he
doesn't
want
to
be
identified
and
it's
in
his
interest
to
say
my
name
is
tom
smith.
and
if
you
follow
the
government's
conclusion...
rather,
it's
position,
then
the
officer
then
relaxes
his
guard,
doesn't
take
appropriate
steps.
we
believe
that
officers
must
protect
themselves
but
do
so
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
constitution.
when
the
court
established
the
terry
rule,
it
created
an
exception
to
the
previous
rule
was
that
seizures
could
only
occur
on
probable
cause,
which
was
a
greater
evidentiary
standard.
and
the
court
was
very
careful
to
suggest
that
there
was
a
limited
right,
not
a
general
exploratory
search,
that
now
we
will
be
involved
when...
excuse
me...
because
a
name,
the
government
suggests,
will
be
the
key
to
unlock
data
that
is
endless,
given
the
modern
age
of
technology,
that
the
government
can
learn
about
that
person.
it
is
a
general
exploratory
search
which
the
government
ultimately
is
asking
this
court
to
approve
of.
and
then
privacy
is
a...
a
nice
principle
to
talk
about
as
a
part
of
history.
going
forward,
it
will
not
be
part
of
american
citizens'
natural
relationship
by
right
that
they
can
count
on.
there
are
related
freedoms
that
this
court
also
looks
to
in
the
balancing.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
and...
and--
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
--i
would
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
dolan
well...
well,
with
respect
to
the
terry
stop
itself,
it
is
for
investigation
related
to
whether
or
not
a
crime
may
occur
or
is
about
to
occur.
and
the
officer
has
available
to
them
tools
to
inquire.
they
can
temporarily
detain
the
person
to
see
if
there
are
witnesses
around
who
could
identify
the
person
as
having
engaged
in
criminal
conduct
and
the
like.
but
the...
the
notion
that
a
person
has
to
affirmatively
provided
a
ticket
to
terminate
that
terry
encounter
really
tips
the
balance
too
much
in
favor
of
the
state
and
risks
a
lot
of
benefits
to
our
society
that
accrue
through
freely
being
able
to
move,
to
be
let
alone,
to
engage
in
protected
activity
without
being
subjected
to
the
accosting
that
one
is
subjected
to
during
a
terry
stop.
suspicious
behavior
is
not
easily
or
usefully
quantified,
so
this
court
has
found.
and
because
what
is
suspicious
to
an
officer--
