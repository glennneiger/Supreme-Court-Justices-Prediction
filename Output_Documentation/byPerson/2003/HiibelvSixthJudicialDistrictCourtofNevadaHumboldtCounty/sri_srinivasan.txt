mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
person
detained,
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
of
crime,
may
be
required
to
provide
his
name
to
officers
because
that
requirement
contributes
significantly
to
the
ability
of
law
enforcement
officers
to
ensure
their
own
safety
and
that
of
the
public
while
imposing
only
a
minimal
burden
on
an
individual's
protected
interests
in
privacy.
the
question
under
the
fourth
amendment
would
be
whether
an
otherwise--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--justice
stevens,
it's
true
that
a
patdown
authority
provides
a
measure
of
protection
for
an
officers,
and
it's...
it's
an
important
one,
but
the
authority
to
determine
a
person's
name
and
thereby
run
a
background
check
is
a
highly
significant,
complementary
measure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
and...
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
and
a
patdown
authority
is
conditioned--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
the
authority
to
conduct
a
patdown
search,
first
of
all,
is
conditioned
on
there
being
reason...
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous.
and
so
obtaining
a
person's
name--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--because
a
patdown
isn't
foolproof.
the...
the
officer
might
be
assaulted
in
a
physical
assault
rather
than
through
the
use
of
arms--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--and
in
addition--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right,
justice
scalia.
the
first
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
is
that
the
patdown
authority
is
conditioned
on
there
being
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
has--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous
before
the
authority
to
conduct
a
patdown
frisk
kicks
in.
and
what
the...
what
the
authority
to
determine
a
person's
name
and
thereby
determine
their
criminal
history
does
is
to
afford
the
officer
with
information
that
may
lead
him
to
believe
that
he's
dealing
with
a
dangerous
individual.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
i
don't
think
it's
a...
it's
a
question
of
sequence.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it
would...
first
of
all,
it
would
depend
on
whether
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous
because
if
there
is
not
that
reasonable
basis,
the
authority
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
conduct
a
patdown
at
all.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
it
would,
but
the...
the
reason
why
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
showing
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
they're
armed
and
dangerous
before
conducting
a
patdown
is
because,
as
the
court
described
the
patdown
in
terry,
it
represents
a
severe
intrusion
on
the
person's
personal
security.
and
that's
not
the
case
for
the
question,
what
is
your
name.
that
doesn't
represent
any
sort
of
physical
intrusion
on
the
person
whatsoever.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
that's
critical
to
explaining
why
in
all
cases
the
officer
should
have
an
authority
to
compel
the
person
to
disclose
his
name.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
correct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
what
you're
pointing
to,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
is
the
dictum
that
was
discussed
early
in
berkemer
v....
in
berkemer
v.
mccarty.
and
that,
first
of
all,
is
dictum,
but
not
only
is
it
dictum,
it's
ambiguous
dictum
because
the
language
that
the
court
used
was
that
the
officer
is
entitled
to
ask
a
moderate
number
of
questions,
first,
to
determine
the
person's
identity
and,
second,
to
obtain
information
with
which
to
confirm
or
dispel
the
officer's
suspicions.
and
then
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that,
of
course,
the
detainee
is
not
required
to
respond.
it's
unclear
whether
that
statement
concerning
that
the
detainee
is
not
required
to
respond
relates
to
the
initial
basis
for
asking
questions
which
is
determinative
of
his
identity.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
court
specifically
left
the...
the
question
open,
at
least
on
two
occasions,
both
in
brown
v.
texas
and
in
kolender
v.
lawson.
so
i
don't
think
the
court
is
in
any
way
inhibited
by
its
precedents.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
it
comes
after
the
officer
has
made
a
determination
to
detain.
that's
correct.
the
issue
under
the
fifth
amendment
i
think
is...
is--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
if
he
has
a
reason
to
believe--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
but
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
the
patdown
eliminates
the
danger.
the
patdown
is
important
in
addressing
the
possibility
that
the
person
might
use
arms
that
are
on
their
person
against
the
officer,
but
it
does...
it
in
no
way
eliminates
the
danger
to
the
officer.
and
that's
why--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
we're
not...
we're
not
taking
that
position
and
the
courts--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't
know
that
it's
a
false
position.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it's
not
only
danger
to
the
officer's
safety,
but
it
also
could
provide
crucial
information
for
the
officer
to...
to
assess
the
individual's
conduct
because
if
the
officer
learns
that
the
person
has
previously
been
convicted
of
a
crime
that
fits
that
pattern
that
he
observed
in
deciding
to
detain
the
person,
then
that
could
go
a
long
ways
towards
officer's
determination
that
there's
probable
cause
for
an
arrest.
and
of
course,
that
would
be
crucial
in...
in
terms
of
public
safety
because
it
could
prevent
commission
of
an
imminent
offense
or
the
ongoing
commission
of
a
continuing
offense.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
that's
true.
and...
and
as...
from
the
perspective
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
a
limitation
related
to
answers
to
questions.
i
think
the
limitation
would
arise
under
the
fifth
amendment,
and
what
the
fifth--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
i...
no.
the
court
hasn't
specifically
spoken
to
that
question,
but
we
don't
challenge
the
dictum--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
we
don't
take
the...
we
don't
take
that
position
because
we
don't
challenge
the
dictum
in
berkemer
and
other
cases
insofar
as--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
correct.
