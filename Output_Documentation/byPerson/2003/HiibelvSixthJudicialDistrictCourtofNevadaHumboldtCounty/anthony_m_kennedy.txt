justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
routine
police
investigation
gives
rise
to
this
constitutional
case.
the
sheriff’s
department
in
humboldt
county,
nevada
received
an
afternoon
telephone
call
reporting
an
assault.
the
caller
reported
seeing
a
man
assault
a
woman
and
they
were
in
a
red
and
silver
truck
on
a
place
called
grass
valley
road.
the
deputy
was
dispatched
to
the
scene
and
he
found
the
vehicle
meeting
that
description,
pulled
off
to
the
side
of
the
road.
a
man
was
standing
outside
the
truck
nearby
and
a
woman
was
inside
it.
the
officer
told
the
man
he
was
investigating
a
report
of
a
fight.
the
man
appeared
intoxicated.
the
officer
asked
if
he
had
any
identification
on
him.
the
unidentified
man
became
agitated
and
insisted
he
had
done
nothing
wrong.
eleven
different
times
the
officer
asked
for
identification
and
was
refused
each
time.
the
man
began
to
taunt
the
officer
by
placing
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
telling
the
officer
to
go
ahead
and
arrest
him
and
take
him
to
jail.
the
officer
did
arrest
him.
we
now
know
the
man
arrested
his
name,
larry
dudley
hiible,
who
is
the
petitioner
in
the
case
now
berfore
us.
hiibel
was
charged
with
willfully
obstructing
the
police
officer
in
the
course
of
his
official
duties,
and
the
specific
reason
for
the
criminal
charge
was
that
he
failed
to
identify
himself.
now,
this
is
an
offense
under
nevada
law.
nevada
law
requires
a
person
who
has
been
stopped
based
on
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
he
is
involved
in
criminal
activity
to
tell
the
officer
his
name
when
asked
to
do
so.
hiibel
was
charged
and
convicted
and
sentenced
for
violating
this
requirement,
and
he
was
sentenced
to
pay
a
$250
fine.
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
affirmed
the
conviction
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
the
state
supreme
court.
hiibel
argues
that
his
conviction
is
invalid
because
it
was
obtained
in
violation
of
his
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
rights.
we
reject
his
arguments
and
affirm
his
conviction.
the
nevada
law
in
this
case
is
an
enactment
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
stop-and-identify
statute.
now,
there
is
no
claim
that
it
is
vague
or
imprecise.
it
requires
only
that
a
suspect
disclose
his
name
when
there
has
been
a
stop
as
authorized
by
terry
versus
ohio.
a
terry-stop
is
a
brief
investigatory
stop
authorized
when
an
officer
has
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
who
is
detained
is
involved
in
criminal
activity.
now,
the
investigatory
stop
here
was
valid
under
terry.
there
seems
to
be
no
dispute
about
that.
the
dispute
is
over
the
further
requirement
that
the
suspect
identify
himself.
we
hold
first
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
a
law
requires
the
suspect
in
a
terry-stop
to
disclose
his
identity.
obtaining
the
suspect’s
name
in
a
course
of
a
terry-stop
serves
important
government
interests.
knowledge
of
identity
may
inform
an
officer
that
a
suspect
is
wanted
for
another
offense
or
has
a
record
of
violence
or
of
a
mental
disorder.
on
the
other
hand,
knowing
identity
may
clear
a
suspect
and
allow
the
police
to
concentrate
their
efforts
elsewhere.
identity
maybe
particularly
important
in
cases
such
as
this
where
the
police
are
investigating
what
appears
to
be
a
domestic
assault.
officers
called
to
investigate
domestic
disputes
need
to
know
whom
they
are
dealing
with
in
order
to
assess
the
situation
and
the
threat
to
their
own
safety
in
possible
dangers
to
potential
victims.
the
request
for
identity
has
an
immediate
relation
to
the
purpose,
rationale,
and
practical
demands
of
a
terry-stop.
the
nevada
statute
does
not
alter
the
nature
of
the
stop
itself.
it
does
not
change
its
duration
or
its
location.
a
state
law
requiring
a
suspect
to
disclose
his
name
in
the
course
of
a
valid
terry-stop
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
next,
petitioner
contends
that
his
conviction
violates
the
fifth
amendment
prohibition
on
compelled
self-incrimination.
we
disagree.
the
fifth
amendment
prohibition
extends
only
to
compelled
testimony
that
is
incriminating.
in
this
case,
petitioner's
refusal
to
disclose
his
name
was
not
based
on
any
articulated,
real,
and
appreciable
fear
that
his
name
would
be
used
to
incriminate
him
or
that
it
would
furnish
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
needed
to
convict
him
of
a
crime.
as
best
we
can
tell,
petitioner
refused
to
identify
himself
only
because
he
thought
his
name
was
none
of
the
officer’s
business.
even
today,
petitioner
does
not
explain
how
the
disclosure
of
his
name
could
have
been
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
case.
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
overwrite
the
nevada
law
at
least
absent
the
reasonable
beliefs
that
the
disclosure
would
tend
to
incriminate.
the
narrow
scope
of
the
disclosure
requirement
is
important.
one’s
identity
is
by
definition
unique
yet
it
is
in
another
sense
of
universal
characteristic.
answering
a
request
to
disclose
a
name
is
likely
to
be
so
insignificant
in
the
scheme
of
things
is
to
be
incriminating
only
in
unusual
circumstances.
still
a
case
may
arise
where
there
is
a
substantial
allegation
that
furnishing
identity
at
the
time
of
the
stop
would
have
given
the
police
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
needed
to
convict
the
individual
of
a
separate
offense.
in
that
case,
the
court
can
then
consider
whether
the
privilege
applies
and
if
the
fifth
amendment
has
been
violated,
what
remedy
must
follow.
we
need
not
resolve
those
questions
here.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
nevada
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justices
souter
and
ginsburg.
