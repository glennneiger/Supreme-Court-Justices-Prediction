unknown
speaker
hiibel.
very
well.
unknown
speaker
could
the
officer
have
just
said,
show
me
your
driver's
license?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
evidence...
was
it
not
clear
that
he
had
been
driving
and
he
got
out
of
his
vehicle?
at
the
time
the
officer
saw
him,
he
was
out.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
factual
situation?
he...
he
was
certainly
right
next
to
a
truck,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
he
could
have
asked
for
his
driver's
license?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
the
officer
had
been
told
that
in
a
truck...
in
that
truck
somebody
was
hitting
somebody.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
what...
what
do
you
think
the
purpose
of
our...
of
our
terry...
of
our
terry
decision
is?
i
mean,
it
says
that
when
an
officer
sees
somebody
in
suspicious
circumstances,
he
can
stop
that
person
and
inquire
to
satisfy
himself
that
nothing...
nothing
underhanded
is
going
on.
now,
what...
what
kind
of
questions
can
he
ask
that...
that
must
be
answered?
any
at
all?
unknown
speaker
he...
he
can't
even
ask
the
name
you
say.
unknown
speaker
can
he
ask
what...
what
are
you
doing
here
if
he
sees
somebody
hanging
around
a
jewelry
store
at
2:00
a.m.
and...
and
so
he...
he
conducts
a
terry
stop?
what...
what
can
he
ask
the
fellow?
what
are
you
doing
here?
i
mean,
if
he
can't
give
his
name,
surely
he
doesn't
have
to
tell
the
officer
what
he's
doing
here.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
hasn't.
it
hasn't
evolved.
it
was
just
a
terry
stop.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--he's
allowed
to
ask
questions,
but
he
shouldn't
expect
answers.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
a
terry
stop,
when
the
officer
is
attempting
to
make
a
patdown,
can
the
person
resist
it?
unknown
speaker
you
take
the
position,
as
i
understand
your
brief,
that
the
purposes
of
criminal
investigation
simply
do
not
extend
to
asking
for
the
names
of
witnesses,
as...
as
i
understand
you.
suppose
there's
a...
a
bank
robbery
and...
and
there's
a
fatal
shooting
and
the
robbers
run
out
of
the
bank.
the
police
come
a
few
minutes
later.
can
they
ask...
can
they
require
the
witnesses
to
give
their
names?
can
there...
could
there
be
a
state
statute,
properly
drawn
in
that
circumstance,
which
would
require
the
witnesses
to
give
their
names?
unknown
speaker
is
your...
is
your...
your
negative
answer
to
my
question
premised
on
the
fifth
amendment
or
some
privacy
concept?
unknown
speaker
but
identity
is
somehow
different.
it's
kind
of
a
neutral
fact.
under
your
view,
it
wouldn't
be
possible
to
have
some
national
identification
card
requirement
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
one's...
one's
name
probably
is
just
a
neutral
fact.
it's
not
incriminating
one
way
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
but
there
would
be
no
problem
in...
in
checking
the
license
on
the
vehicle
and
then
seeing...
and
then
the
officer
could
ask
are
you
whoever
is
the
owner
of
the
car.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
does
that.
you...
you--
--he
does
that
and
the
person
is--
--you
can
ask...
you
can
ask
if
he's
the
owner
of
the
car,
the
registered
owner
of
the
car,
but
you
can't
ask
him
his
name?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
thought...
no.
you
were
going
to
say
something.
that's
all
right.
go
ahead.
i...
i
thought
your
position
was
that
if
it
had
been
sufficiently
apparent
that
mr.
hiibel
was
associated
with
the
truck,
that
he
owned
it,
had
been
driving
it
or
something
like
that,
that
under
those
circumstances,
the...
the
police
could
have...
could
have
exercised
the
state's
regulatory
power
over
motor
vehicles
and
said,
show
me
your
driver's
license
or
show
me
your
registration.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
the
reason
they
couldn't
do
any
of
those
things
here,
in
the
sense
of
demanding
compliance,
is
that
there
wasn't
a
sufficient
connection
shown
between
the...
the...
mr.
hiibel
and
the
truck.
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
but
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
the
scene.
and
at
the
scene,
you're
saying
there
just
wasn't
a
predicate
for
forcing
him
to
answer
those
questions.
now--
unknown
speaker
--since...
and
since
there
was
not,
i
take
it
your
general
position
is
that
they
can
ask
him
anything.
he
does
not
have
to
say
anything
in
response
to
any
question
they
ask.
period.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
could
they
have...
could
they--
--and
that
sort
of
assumes
that
there's
no
responsibility
on
the
part
of
citizens.
i
mean,
but
we
impose
all
sorts
of
responsibilities
on
citizens
in
connection
with
the...
the
determination
of
criminal
activity.
i
mean,
harboring
a
felon
is...
is
a
crime.
it's...
it's
unlawful
to
give
a
false
response
to
a...
to
inquiry
by
a
federal
investigative
officer.
why
isn't
it
a
perfectly
reasonable
responsibility
of
a
citizen,
when
he's
a
witness
to
the...
to
a
crime,
to
have
to
give
his
name
so
that
he
may
call...
be
called
upon
to
testify?
why
isn't
that
a
minimal...
a
minimal
citizen's
responsibility
and
likewise
in
these
circumstances?
i
cannot
imagine
that
any
responsible
citizen
would
have...
would
have
objected
to
giving
the
name.
and
if...
if
i...
if
one
feels
that
way
about
it,
why
is
it
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to...
to
have
citizens
do
what
every
responsible
citizen,
it
seems
to
me,
would
do?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
in
favor
of
the
state.
it's--
--what's
your
best
case
for
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
naacp
v.
alabama,
but
that
was
a
suspect
class,
membership
lists.
what...
what
else
do
you
have?
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
burden
on
speech.
unknown
speaker
what
about
giving
this
man,
who
appeared
to
be
under
the
influence
of
alcohol,
a
breathalizer
test?
nothing
different.
it's
just
as
a
basis
for
a
terry
stop.
he's
now
out
of
the
car.
the
officer
thinks
mr.
hiibel
could
be
a
menace
on
the
road
and
so
says,
i'm
giving
you
a
breathalizer
test.
could
he
say...
could
he
resist
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the...
there's
a
passenger
sitting
on
the
passenger
seat,
and
he's
gotten
out
and
he's
on
the
driver's
side.
right?
unknown
speaker
and
the...
there
was
somebody
in
that
seat.
unknown
speaker
where...
where
was
the
daughter?
unknown
speaker
could...
could
she
have
been
asked
the
name?
could
she
have
been
asked
her
father's
name?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
have...
have
our
terry
cases
suggested
that
the
whole
point
of
a
stop
and
a
search,
based
on
reasonable
suspicion,
is
to
make
identification?
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
a
concurring
opinion.
do
you
think
that
a
person
stopped
on
reasonable
suspicion
can
be
compelled
to
give
a
fingerprint?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
so
the...
the
officer
who
approaches
somebody
in
a
perfectly
valid
terry
stop,
a
really
suspicious
looking
character,
he
puts
several
questions
to
him
and
the
guy
says,
i'm...
i'm...
you
know,
i
ain't
talking,
the
officer
just
has
to
turn
on
his
heel
and
leave
the
suspicious
character
to
go
about
his
suspicious
business.
unknown
speaker
he
can't...
he
can't
say,
come
along
with
me.
you
know,
we'll
find
out
who
you
are
and
why
you're
here.
he
can't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the...
maybe
you
and
i
differ
on...
on
what
the...
what
the
course
of
a
responsible
citizen
is.
i
would
think
the
course
of
a
responsible
citizen
would
be
to
answer
the
question
what
you're
doing
here
and
what
your
name
is.
and
if
he
doesn't
answer
that,
i
would...
i
would
say
that
that
make...
may
cause
the
situation
to
rise
to
the
level
of
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
he's
hanging
around
a
jewelry
store.
it's
late
at
night.
he
won't
say
who
he
is.
he
wouldn't...
won't
say
what
he's
doing
there.
i
would...
i
would
drag
him
in.
unknown
speaker
it's
possible
but
unlikely.
[laughter]
but
isn't
there
another
answer?
suppose--
--isn't
there
another
answer?
--suppose
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
an
arrest
is
made.
could
the
state
then
require
that
the
person
answer
as
to
his
identity
just
so
that
the
officer
can
confirm
that
he's
got
the
right
person?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
that
you're--
unknown
speaker
--indicating
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
such
a...
a
minor
detail,
in
light
of
what
the
police
can
get
in
any
event
with
fingerprints
and
so
forth,
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
just
say
that
that's
not
testimonial.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you're
not
probing
the
perception,
the
memory,
the
cognition
of
the
witness.
you're
just
determining
an
extrinsic
fact.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
question
that
really
follows
up
on
justice
scalia's
question?
would
you
also
argue
that
the
refusal
to
give
the
name
could
not
be
counted
as
an
additional
fact
to
establish
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
just
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
refusal
is
itself
a
crime
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you
could
again
then
say
you
could
not
even
take
it
into
account
for
determining
whether
there's
enough
evidence
to...
to
take
him
to
the
station.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
suppose
he--
--what...
what
about...
what
about,
say,
the
murder
scene
exception
we
talked
about
in
that
arizona
case
where
an
officer
hears
a
shot
fired,
comes
into
the
house,
there
are
eight
or
nine
people
in
the
house.
obviously,
there's
a
dead
body
in
the
middle
of
the
floor.
can
he
ask
everybody
else
for
their
names?
unknown
speaker
and
are
they
obligated
to
respond?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
are
we
ever...
how
are
we
going
to
resolve
a
murder
case
if
that's
the
law?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
is
like
my
bank
hypothetical.
it
said...
we're
just
talking
about
witnesses
now.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
situations
where
the
state
can...
that
we...
well,
byers
is
one
where
we've
already
said
the
name
can
be
requested.
people
are
required,
when
there's
a
registration
for
the
draft,
to
give
their
names
which...
and
that
can't
be
made
into
a
consensual
situation
in
exchange
for
some
benefit.
so
we've
treated
names...
the
question
of
name
differently,
and
there
are
many
situations
in
which
you
are
required
to
give
the
name.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
terms
of
the
state's
need
to
know
this
information,
how
do
you
distinguish
it
from
requiring
people
to
register,
give
their
name
for
the
draft?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
should
just
plead
the
fifth
amendment,
say,
i...
i
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
it
might
incriminate
me.
that...
was
that...
was
that
what
was
done
here?
i
didn't
realize
you're...
you're
making
a...
a
fifth
amendment
incrimination
claim.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
part
of
your--
--i...
i
can
go
back
for
a
second--
unknown
speaker
--so
that...
that
assumes
that
he
was
guilty
and...
and
had
he
not
been...
had
he
not
been
guilty
of
the
beating,
then
he...
then...
then
you
would
acknowledge
that
he
would
have
had
to
answer.
it's
only
the
person
who's
guilty
of
the
beating
who
would
have
a
right
not
to
answer.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--please
answer
the...
the
question
yes
or
no.
are
you
saying
that
only
the...
the
person
who
had
been
beating
the
woman
in
the
truck
and
therefore
disclosure
of
his
name
would
incriminate
him,
only
that
person
has
the
right
not
to
answer?
or
are
you
saying
anybody
who
was
asked
had
the
right
not
to
answer?
unknown
speaker
under
the
fifth
amendment--
--so
you're
not
pleading
the
fifth
amendment
then.
i...
that's...
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
arguing
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
if...
if
at
that
point
i
had
walked
down
the
street
and
the
cop
had
turned
to
me
and
said
who
are
you,
i
wouldn't
have
had
a
fifth
amendment
right
to
refuse,
would
i?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no,
no.
i
mean,
you're
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
so
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned,
whether
the
cop
asked
me,
whether
there's
a
statute
that
says
you...
you
ought
to
give
your
name
to
the
police,
would
i
have
had
a
fifth
amendment
right
to
refuse?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
there
might
be
a
fourth
amendment--
--based
upon
other
constitutional
principles.
the
only
thing
justice
scalia
and
i
are
trying
to
get
at
is
we
thought
you
were
saying
at
one
point
that
everyone
has
a
fifth
amendment
to
refuse
to
identify
himself
under
all
circumstances,
and
that...
that...
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
did
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
pass...
did
you
raise
a
fifth
amendment
question
in
the...
in
the
supreme
court
of
nevada?
unknown
speaker
and
did
the
court
pass
on
it?
unknown
speaker
had
you...
had
you
raised
it
before
the
motion
for
rehearing?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
your
answer
that
if...
if
the
law
requires
that
you
give
your
name,
then...
then
that
makes
everybody
have
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
just...
is
just
not
right.
that's
just
circular.
i...
i
would
agree
that
there
may...
there
likely
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
for
witnesses
or
i
would...
i
would
state
that.
you
might
not
agree.
as
to
people
that
are
suspect
of
a
crime,
even
if
they're
innocent,
if
you're...
if
you're
right
that
the
name
is
protected,
then
i
think
the
privilege...
that
the
privilege
applies
because
even
if
they're
innocent,
it
might
be
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
necessary
to
convict.
that's
the...
that's
the
test.
but
the
question,
it...
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
a
name
itself...
a
name
itself
is...
is...
has
such
intrinsic
testimonial
consequences
as
opposed
to
neutral
regulatory
consequences
that
it
should
be
within
the
fifth
amendment.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
is
that
privacy
is
diminished
when
they're
witnesses
to
a
crime
when
they're
present
at
a
crime
scene,
and
that's
certainly
much
different
from
saying
that
all
citizens
have
to
give
their
name
anytime
a
police
officer
asks
them
for
any
reason.
that's
a
completely
different
case.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not...
i'm
not
even
sure
that
the
driver
of
the
truck
would
have
a
fifth
amendment
right.
i
don't
know
how
your
name
incriminates
you.
your
name
may
help
to...
to
catch
you,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
incriminates
you.
by
giving
you...
by
giving
him
your
name,
you
are
what?
proving
that
you
did
something
wrong?
i...
i
don't
see
how
it
incriminates
you.
unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
in
its
concluding
sentence
of
the
majority
says
it
follows
that
n.r.s.
such
and
such
is
good
law
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
don't
see
in
the
majority
opinion
any
reference
to
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
you
say
you
raised
it
on
rehearing?
unknown
speaker
and
the...
the
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
is
simply
the
petition
for
rehearing
is
denied.
unknown
speaker
so
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
at
all
you
raised
it
sufficiently
before
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
did
raise
it
then
in
your
briefs.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
dolan.
mr.
hafen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
now,
that...
that
goes
beyond
byers.
my...
my...
the
hard
part
of
this
case
for
me
is
that
byers
which,
it
seems
to
me,
a
much
easier
case,
was
so
difficult
for
the
court.
you
had
a
fragmented
court.
you
didn't
have
an
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
court.
and
this,
it
does
seem
to
me,
goes
one
step
beyond
byers
with
reference
to
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
byers
didn't
take
the
position
that
you
just
take,
that
it's...
that
it's
not
testimonial.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
plausible
enough
argument,
but
i...
i
can't
get
that
out
of
byers.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'll...
i'll
look
at
it
again,
but
it
seems
to
me
even
the
harlan
opinion
was
in
the
context
of
what
we
might
call
the
regulatory
zone
of...
of
automobile...
automobile
regulation
and
control.
unknown
speaker
the
plurality
opinion
said
that
noting
a
name...
notes
that
a
name,
quote,
identifies
but
does
not
by
itself
implicate
anyone
in
criminal
conduct--
unknown
speaker
--which
is
the
same
point.
unknown
speaker
you
said
name
and
address.
what
else
would
be
under
your
neutral
category?
could
a
telephone
number,
e-mail
address?
how
much
fits
in
that
neutral
category
that
citizens
can
be
required
to
answer?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
asking
you
what
fits...
what
fits
within
this
neutral...
you...
you
say
that
there
are
certain
things
you
can
ask
a
person
that
they
can
be
required
to
respond
to
because
they're
not
incriminating
and
they're
not
a
violation
of
privacy.
they're
just
neutral.
so
i'm
just
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
if
we
say
name
is
neutral,
what
else
are
we
implicating.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
don't
follow
that
really
because
i
can
understand
the
terry
stop.
you
have
to
pat
down
immediately
because
the
officer
is
at
risk
that
the
person
will
be
armed.
but
by
the
time
they
do
the
computer
check,
the
harm...
i
mean,
that
doesn't
arrest
the
situation.
it
doesn't
protect.
how
is
the
officer
protected
in
that
interval
between
when
the
person
says
i
won't
give
you
my
name...
i
mean,
it
had
to...
it
has
to
take
some
time
to
do
a
check,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
does
that...
does
not
information
convert
reasonable
suspicion
into
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
finds
he's
a
real
bad
guy.
does
it
now
become
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
are
in...
in
the
beginning
he
has
reasonable
suspicion
but
not
probable
cause.
the
one
thing
he
learns,
in
addition
to
that,
is
this
is
a
bad
guy.
is
it
now
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
but
i've
already
given
you
all
the
factors.
what
other
factors
are
there?
the
total
of
the
factors
that
exist
are
there's
only
reasonable
suspicion.
we
add
one
more
fact:
he's
a
bad
guy.
does
that
make
it
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
he
has
a
record.
well,
it
might
if
he's
a
bad
guy
with
a
particular...
with
a
particular
pattern.
it
was
a
jewelry
store
and
he
said
he's
a
bad
guy
because
he
robbed
a
lot
of
jewelry
stores
under
these
same
circumstances.
i
mean,
you
could
play
with
hypotheticals,
it
seems
to
me.
he
has
robbed
this
same
jewelry
store
10
previous
times.
[laughter]
don't
you
think
that
would
elevate
it
to
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
likelihood
of...
the
likelihood
of
getting
that
precise
information
is
quite
remote,
i
think,
in
most
of
these
cases.
unknown
speaker
what
about
berkemer?
unknown
speaker
i...
i've
read
the...
the
brief
here.
it's
a
case
called
berkemer
v.
mccarty
referred
to
on
page
13.
there
must
be
some
obvious
answer
i'm
missing.
they're
talking
about
a
terry
stop
and
they
say...
the...
the
court
says
this.
you
can
ask
him
questions,
but
the
detainee
is
not
obliged
to
respond
and
then
a
bunch
of
others.
so
if
he's
not
obliged
to
respond,
he's
not
obliged
to
respond.
now,
what
do
we
do
about
that
case?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
there's
a
lot.
you
know,
they
have
like
two
pages
here
of
different
judges,
harlan,
white,
berkemer,
davis,
and
each
time
the
court
said,
but
they're
not
obliged
to
respond.
now...
now,
i...
what
i
thought...
i
guess
i'm
approaching
this
case
quite
differently,
but
i
thought
we're
not
talking
about
national
id
cards.
what
we're
talking
about
are
terry
stops.
and
a
terry
stop
is
a
derogation
from
the
ordinary
situation
where
you
can
walk
along
and
do
what
you
want.
so
if
we're
derogating
from
the
person's
ordinary
freedom,
what
the
court
did
in
carving
out
exception
was
to
create
a
condition.
you
can
ask,
but
he
doesn't
have
to
answer.
now,
the
virtue
of
that
is
simple.
anyone
can
understand
it
and
it
doesn't
get
us
into
all
these
problems
that
were
raised
previously
whether
those
problems
are
right,
wrong,
or
indifferent.
so
if
i
read
three
supreme
court
cases
and
it
all
says
that,
i
think
maybe
there's
some
burden
in
saying
on
your
part
why
we
shouldn't
just
follow
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
then
why
complicate
the
matter?
that
is,
you've
already
said
a
name
doesn't
normally
incriminate
you,
but
it
could.
suppose
his
name
is
killer
magee.
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
i
mean,
it's
possible.
and
then
i
guess
you
could
have
other
questions,
you
know,
that
don't
normally
incriminate
you.
are
you
hungry?
would
you
like
to
sit
down?
but...
so...
so
why
get
into
this
complicated
thing
of
saying
whether
a
question
normally
isn't
or
normally
is
or
sometimes
or
sometimes?
why
don't
we
just
follow
what
the
court
said?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
answer--
--and
there's
another
answer
that--
--is
because
the
court
said
it
in
dictum.
right?
unknown
speaker
what
case
are
you
referring
to
when
we
said
it
in
dictum?
unknown
speaker
but
even
there,
we
did
not
say
it
was
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
right.
a
fifth
amendment
privilege,
and
that's
what
you're...
you're
here
to
argue.
you're
here
to
say
that
this
is
just
not
covered
by
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
is
not
testimonial.
it's
a
neutral
fact.
i...
i
agree
with
you
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
a
terry
stop
and
i'm
simply--
--which
is
a
fourth
amendment
issue.
that's
right.
we
have
both
issues
here,
do
we
not?
right,
right,
right.
fourth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment?
even
if
it
doesn't
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
we're
still
going
to
have
to
answer
the
fourth
amendment
question
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
not
expressly
said
that
nevada
can
require
identification,
or
any
other
state.
we
haven't
said
that
in
a
holding.
unknown
speaker
and
the
language
is--
--nor...
nor
have
we
said
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
it
is
correct?
i'm
sorry.
not
in
a
holding,
but
i
mean,
there
are
about
four
cases
where
they
say,
of
course...
and
of
course,
it's
that.
now,
i
grant
you
that
dicta,
which
of
course
this
is,
is...
varies
in
its
strength
and
so
forth,
but
if
we
have
a
repeated
series
of
cases
that
say
it,
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
pretty
good
reason
for
departing
from
it?
and
that's
what
i'm
listening
for:
a
pretty
good
reason.
well,
do
all
those
cases
that
you're
referring
to
hypothesize
the
existence
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
are
some
of
them
just
confrontation
without
reasonable
suspicion?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
he
says
this
while
discussing
terry
stops.
that
they
said
this
while
discussing
terry
stops.
is
that
so
in
respect
to
berkemer?
i'm
just
reading
the
brief.
the...
the
language
i
quoted
was
while
discussing
terry
stops.
unknown
speaker
well,
i--
--could
you...
could
you
explain
to
us
why
you
think
the
nevada
supreme
court
didn't
mention
the
fifth
amendment
in
its
opinion?
unknown
speaker
because
they're
quite
different,
and
certainly
the
fifth
amendment
issue
is
important
and
perhaps
even
harder
than
the
other
issue.
unknown
speaker
but
it...
but
it
is
the...
the
odd
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
inquiry
is
made
and
it's
significant
only
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
investigation.
that's
the
only
time
the
statute
applies,
when
you've
got
a
terry
stop.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
all
the
arguments
on
the
fourth
amendment,
but
for
me
the
more
difficult
issue,
frankly,
is
the
fifth
amendment.
and
it's
really
strange
that
they
didn't...
they
didn't
discuss
it
at
all
and
it
is
strange
that...
we're
all
concerned
about
identification
cards
and
national
and
all
this
sort
of
stuff.
but
this
case
is
very,
very
narrow.
it's
just
a
case
where
somebody
gets
stopped.
he
doesn't
realize
there's
a
statute
on
the
books
that
said,
if
you
don't
answer,
you
can
go
to
jail
or
get...
get
arrested.
the
funny
thing
about
it
is
there
are
no
warnings
required
here.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
statute...
but
the
statute
didn't
require
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
ignorance
of
the
law
is
generally
no
excuse,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
that
the
fifth
amendment
is...
is
the
hard...
harder
question
in
this
case,
especially
given
the
convoluted
opinions
in
byers.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
because
the
statute
really
focuses
on
what
we
might
call
terry
stops,
that
you
have
a
class
of
persons
who
are
within
the
zone
of
the
commission
of
a
crime,
and
so
the
fifth
amendment
becomes...
it
becomes
slightly
more
of
a
suspect
class.
i
don't
know
how
that
could
take
care
of
the
witness
hypothetical.
but
this
person
was
certainly
under
suspicion
of...
of
criminal
activity.
unknown
speaker
what...
what's
the
closest
case
you
have
for
us?
the
nevada
court
doesn't
address
this
issue.
what's
the
closest
case
you
have
for
us
to
show
that
this
is
not
a
fifth
amendment
violation?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
thought
your...
you
were
saying
earlier
that
your
strongest
reason
would
be
that
he
had
already,
in
effect,
taken
himself
out
of
fifth
amendment
protection
by
saying
i
know
nothing
about
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
then
your
rationale
for
the
arrest
should
be
that
you're
a
potential
witness,
and
for
that
reason,
we
have
a
right
to...
we
have
a
right
to
apprehend
the
witness
to
make
him
testify
to
the
crime.
you
don't
need
the...
the
terry
stop
rationale
for
that.
if
you
think
he's
a
witness
to
a
crime,
the
terry
stop
is
really
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
from
the
standpoint
of
the
fifth
amendment,
what
rule
do
you
want
us
to
adopt?
when
can
the
police
require
persons
to
give
their
identity
in
your
view
under
the
fifth
amendment
constitutionally?
unknown
speaker
what
about
our
witness
hypothetical
where...
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
of...
of
the
murder
with
five
people
standing
there
and
my
hypothetical...
you
don't...
you
don't
think
the
police
can
demand
identification
at
that
point
from
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
what...
could
they
be
criminalized
if
they
fail
to
give
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
oh,
so
then
you're
abandoning
the
witness
rationale.
well,
but
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
pure
witness.
that's
the
point.
this...
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
the...
to
the
witness
of
the
bank
robbery
who's
not
suspected
of
doing
the
robbery.
unknown
speaker
no.
the...
the
hypothetical
situation
is
purely
a
witness.
they've
been
standing
in
line
at
the
counter.
he
saw
somebody
rob
the
bank.
but
he's
not
suspected
at
all.
all...
our
hypothetical...
you
could
make
him
give
his
name
because
you
want
his
testimony
at
the
trial.
but
that's
not
a...
that's
not
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
be
rather
odd
that
you
could
ask
innocent
people
to
give
their
name
and
not...
and
not
a
person
under
criminal
suspicion.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
maybe
when
he's
invoking
the
fifth
amendment,
he
has
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
maybe...
if
he
just
can't
say
i
won't
answer...
he
can
be
arrested
if
he
just
says
i
won't
answer,
but
if
he
says
i
won't
answer
on
the
ground
that
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
me,
then
the
policeman
would
probably
have
probable
cause.
wouldn't
he?
[laughter]
but
it
seems
to
me
sort
of...
you
know,
sort
of
sneaky
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
without
invoking
the
fifth
amendment.
he...
he
didn't...
that
wasn't
the
reason
he
gave
for
not
answering.
i
thought
people
usually
invoke
the
fifth
amendment.
they
say,
i
refuse
to
answer
that
question...
you
know,
they
have
their
lawyer
next
to
them...
on
the
ground
that
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
me.
unknown
speaker
can
they...
can
they
just
say
i
don't
want
to
answer
that
question?
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
interrupt?
how
do
you
distinguish
this
so-called
neutral
fact
from
a
billion
other
neutral
facts
which
have
evidentiary
significance
in
a
criminal
trial?
it's
a
neutral
fact
that
i'm
wearing
a
pinstripe
suit,
but
if
the
evidence
was
that
the
bank
robber
was
wearing
a
pinstripe
suit,
this...
this
would
be
relevant
evidence
and
it
might
tip
the
scale
in...
in
proof.
it's
neutral.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is...
this
is--
--thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
hafen.
unknown
speaker
mr.
srinivasan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
would
you...
may
i
just
interrupt
there?
how
does
it
help
the
officer's
safety
if...
he's
made
the
patdown.
he
finds
he
is
or
not
armed.
if
he's
armed,
of
course,
he
arrests
him.
he's
not
armed.
and
he...
now,
how
does
it
help
the
officer's
safety
at
this
point
to
find
out
whether
he
should
just
let
him
go
away
or
he
should
call
a
station
and
ask...
do
something
when
he
knows
his
name?
unknown
speaker
do
officers
always
pat
down
before
they
ask
questions?
i've
had
officers
ask
me
questions
often
without
telling
me
to
spread
my
legs,
put
my
arms
up
against
the
wall,
and
they...
they
frisk
me.
unknown
speaker
we
certainly
want
to
encourage
that
kind
of
activity,
would
we?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
terry
case
does
encourage
that
kind
of
activity.
if
you
have
reasonable
suspicion,
that's
the
first
thing
you
do
is...
is
pat
them
down.
unknown
speaker
and
my
question
is
once
he
finds
he's
not
armed,
why
is
his
officer...
why
is
his
safety
implicated
by
not
deciding
to
let
him
go
instead
of
calling
the
station
and
detaining
him
further?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
a
patdown
would
not--
unknown
speaker
--a
patdown
would
not
occur
unless
he
had
reason
to
believe
the
person
was
armed,
which
in
most
cases
he
will
not
have.
and
he...
if
he
finds
out
that
the
guy
he's
confronting
with
is,
you
know,
machine
gun
harry,
he's
going
to
have
a...
a
different
approach
to
that
individual.
i
don't
see
how
there's
any
question
that
it...
it
can
help
the...
the
officer's
safety
unless
you
expect
the
officer
always
to
pat
down
people,
which
they...
they
can't
do
unless
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
is
armed--
unknown
speaker
--which
usually
they
don't
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
suspicion,
but
there
doesn't
have
to
be
reasonable
suspicion
that
he's
armed.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
part
of
the
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
position
they
should
get
the
answer
to
the
identity
question
before
they
pat
him
down?
unknown
speaker
which
comes
first
in
your
view
in
the
normal
police
procedure
where
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
under
terry?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
on
your
reasoning
that
he
can
ask
for
the...
for
the
name
for
reasons
of
safety...
and
that's
why
it
should
be
allowed
without
anything
more...
why
doesn't
exactly
that
same
reason
support
an
authority
to...
to
patdown
even
in
the
absence
of
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
may
be
armed
and
dangerous?
it
would
contribute
to
officer
safety.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
your
argument
really
boils
down
to
the...
i
mean,
the...
the
crucial
part
of
your
argument
is...
is
the...
is
the
relatively...
relative
insignificance
of
the
intrusion.
unknown
speaker
but
for
that,
we'd
be
in
the
same
boat
with
name
and
patdown.
unknown
speaker
the
insignificance
of
the
intrusion.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
thought...
i
thought
under
terry
we've
held
that
a
police
officer
may
detain
someone
briefly
without
probable
cause
on
a
reasonable
suspicion
the
person
has
committed
or
is
about
to
commit
a
crime
and
during
that
process
may
ask
all
kinds
of
questions
of
the
person,
although,
as
far
as
i
can
find
out,
this
court
has
said
the
person
does
not
have
to
respond
to
the
questions.
unknown
speaker
but
we've
just
never
said
that
the
officer
may
require
the
identification.
that's
what
this
case
asks
us
to
determine.
unknown
speaker
and
the
right
to
do
a
patdown
is
something
you
do
after
the
officer
has
made
the
initial
decision
to
detain
and
ask
some
questions
presumably.
unknown
speaker
can
we
go
back
to...
would
you
go
back
to
the
fourth
because
i...
i
suppose
the...
the
officer
can
ask,
you
know,
and
he
doesn't
get
an
answer,
so
he
pats
him
down.
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
very,
very
unlikely
i
would
think,
unless
you
have
some
evidence
to
the
contrary,
that
the
officer
who's
in
a
terry
stop
situation.
are
there...
a
lot
of
instances
where
they
look...
he
said
what's
your
name
and
then
the
person...
and
by
the
way,
you
have
to
answer
or
you're
going
to
be
in
more
trouble
so
therefore
the
person
gives
him
his
real
name,
which
happens
to
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
worst
criminals
in
the
country,
and
then
he
pats
him
down.
i
grant
you
that
could
happen.
but
contrast
that
with
a
situation
where
you
take
berkemer
literally,
and
now
you
say
if
he
doesn't
answer,
sure
you
can
pat
him
down.
what's
wrong...
i...
i
don't
see
it.
i'm
back
to
my
point
which
you
heard
me
ask,
and
i...
i'd
really
like
an
answer
in
terms
of...
i
mean,
berkemer
cites
davis
and
davis
refers
to
the
settled
principle...
settled...
that
you
can't...
you
can
ask
what
you
want,
but
they
don't
have
to
answer.
okay?
so
there
are
a
lot
of
circumstances
where
it
may
be
national
id
cards
or
whatever,
which
are
not
terry
stop
situations.
but
why
should
we
retreat
from
that
dictum?
now,
i
hear
your
answer
about
the...
about
the
danger
and
i
think
that's
an
important
point.
but
i...
i
sort
of
canceled
that
by
thinking
not
answering
would
also
give
the
policeman
a
justification
for
the
patdown.
and...
and
now,
if
that's
right,
what
other
reason
is
there
for
retreating
from
the
rather
strong
dictum?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
you
don't
believe
that
the
failure
to
give
a
name
gives
the
officer
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
is
armed,
do
you?
i
mean,
simply
because
he
refuses
to
give
you
a
name,
do
you
have
justification
to
do
a
patdown?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i...
i
know
a
lot
of
people
that
might
not
want
to
give
their
names--
--well,
it
would
be
pretty
odd
to
say
that
you
can
force
a
person
to
give
his
name
in
order
to
protect
the
policeman,
but
the
far
lesser
restriction
of
just
taking
it
into
account
as
evidence
you
can't
do.
that
would
be
an
unusual
position.
i
mean,
taking
it
into
account
is
a
factor
suggesting
danger,
you
can't
do,
but
of
course
you
can
require
him
to
answer
under
penalty
of
a
crime.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean,
everybody
is
in
a
false
position
here
because
you're...
you're
being
put
in
a
slightly
false
position.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
yes,
all
right.
i'll...
i'll
take
your
answer.
danger.
is
there
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
then
why...
why
do
you
stop
at
the
name?
answers
to
any
questions
would
have
that
effect.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
far
as
the...
so
far
as
terry
and
the
fourth
amendment
are
concerned,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you.
are
you
saying
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
answer
all
questions,
not
just
names?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i...
i
thought...
is
that...
is
that
the
position
that
you're
taking?
unknown
speaker
okay.
then
why
do
you
stop...
why
do
you
stop
at
the
name?
is
it
again
the...
the
minimal
intrusion,
that
that
is
a
more
minimal
intrusion
than
other
information?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
srinivasan.
mr.
dolan,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're...
you're
saying
people
can
disobey
the
law
to
make
it
ineffective.
that's
not
usually
an
argument
we
accept.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
there's
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
the
person
is
committing
a
crime,
it
doesn't
shock
me
that
they'd
use
the
identification
mechanisms
to
check
it
out.
i
mean,
we're...
we're
on
the
assumption
that
the
person
has
been
stopped
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion--
unknown
speaker
--of
committing
a
crime.
unknown
speaker
so
why
not
let
them
check
in
the
computer
records
to
see
if
this
is
the
worst
prior
offender
they've
ever
had?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
