mr.
john
j.
gibbons
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
is
at
stake
in
this
case
is
the
authority
of
the
federal
courts
to
uphold
the
rule
of
law.
respondents
assert
that
their
actions
are
absolutely
immune
from
judicial
examination
whenever
they
elect
to
detain
foreign
nationals
outside
our
borders.
under
this
theory,
neither
the
length
of
the
detention,
the
conditions
of
their
confinement,
nor
the
fact
that
they
have
been
wrongfully
detained
makes
the
slightest
difference.
respondents
would
create
a
lawless
enclave
insulating
the
executive
branch
from
any
judicial
scrutiny
now
or
in
the
future.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
it
wouldn't
weaken
it
at
all
because
as
i'll
get
into
in
the
argument,
the
case
depends
on
compliance
with
provisions
of
a
binding
treaty,
which
requires
a
prompt
determination
of
their
status.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
they
would
have
had
entitlement
to
the
process
specified
in
the
geneva
convention,
and
if
they
had
that
process--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--they
allege
not,
and
on
this
record,
you
have
to
assume
that,
as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
your
honor,
the
question
of
the
private
right
of
action
really
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
we
are
not
asking
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
from
the
geneva
convention
or
any
other
treaty.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
cause
of
action
is
created
by
the
habeas
corpus
statute
and
by
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
treaty
provides
a
rule
of
decision,
not
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--it
doesn't
depend
on
section
1331,
although
the
administrative
procedure
act
claim
does
depend
on
section
1331.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes.
i'm
asserting
that.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that
does--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--your
honor,
justice
scalia,
it
does
depend
on
section
1331.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
now--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--oh,
absolutely.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
no.
we
don't.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
these
people
were
friendly
aliens,
assumed
that
they
had
never
been
members
of
any
armed
forces,
and
had
never
carried
out
any
belligerent
activity
against
the
united
states.
assumed
that
they
had
never
had
the
hearing
required
by
the
geneva
convention
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
fact
they
were
civilians
who
should
have
been
repatriated.
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was,
and
it's
on
page
1141
of
the
court's
opinion,
if
the
constitution
does
not
entitle
detainees
to
due
process,
and
it
does
not,
they
cannot
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
our
courts
to
test
the
constitutionality
or
legality
of
restraints
on
their
liberty.
thus
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
the...
that
the
result
turned
on
the
absence
of
a
constitutional
right,
and
that
simply
misreads
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
section
2241(c)(1),
which
is
carried
forward
in
virtually
identical
language
from
section
14
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
antedated
the
bill
of
rights.
all
it
required,
all
it
has
ever
required
is
federal
custody
simpliciter,
and
that
gives
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
of
course.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
your
honor,
the
geneva
convention
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
that's
what
the
constitution
says
about
habeas.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
your
honor,
your
honor--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--what
the
judge
is
supposed
to
do
is
determine
first
whether
or
not
the
government's
response
that
the
detention
is
legal
is
in
fact
an
adequate
response.
now,
the
government
in
this
case
probably
will
respond,
we
don't
have
to
give
the
hearings
required
by
the
geneva
convention.
but
if
you're
going
to
treat
a
binding
united
states
treaty
as
the
supreme
law
of
the
land,
that
is
not
an
adequate
answer.
now,
this
question
of,
is
the
treaty
self-executing
or
not
self-executing,
i
suggest
is
a
straw
man.
since
1813,
if
a
treaty
provides
a
rule
of
decision
and
something
else
provides
a
cause
of
action,
the
treaty
nevertheless
provides
the
rule
of
decision.
that
was
several--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
latter
part
of
your
sentence
is
probably
an
overreading
of
johnson.
in
johnson,
which
i
suggest
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
case,
there
were
three
critical
facts.
one
was
that
they
were
admitted
enemy
aliens.
our
petitioners
plead
that
they
are
not.
the
other
was
that
they
had
a
hearing
before
a
military
tribunal
which
comported
with
federal
legislation
and
with
the
extant
rules
of
international
law,
and
our
petitioners
have
had
no
such
hearing.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
we
would
not
be.
what
we
are
seeking
is
the
review
provided--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--if
they
were
detained
after
a
hearing
determined
that
they
were
civilian
detainees
who
under
article
iv
of
the
geneva
convention
should
be
repatriated,
we
would
be
here.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
i
suggest
that
a
fair
reading
of
eisentrager
is
that
that
did
turn
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
no,
you
do
not,
justice
souter.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
it's
our
position
that
eisentrager
was
a
decision
on
the
merits
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
court
says
that
they...
petitioners
were
extended
the
same
preliminary
hearing
as
the
sufficiency
application
that
was
extended
in
quirin,
yamashita
and
hirota
versus
mcarthur,
all
of
which
were
decisions
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
they
are
not
as
a
matter...
let
me
be
clear
about
that.
the
result
on
the
merits
in
eisentrager
is
perfectly
correct.
what
the
court
did
in
eisentrager
was
apply
the
scope
of
review
on
habeas
corpus,
which
was
standard
at
that
time.
if
the
military
tribunal
had
lawful
jurisdiction,
that
ended
the
habeas
inquiry.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
your
honor,
in
eisentrager,
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
they
disapproved,
they
were
not
adopting
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
based
on
ahrens
v.
clark.
of
course,
in
any
event,
that
does
not
go
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that's
a
rule
12(b)(2)
issue
of
in
personam
jurisdiction,
whether
a
proper
respondent
is
before
the
court.
in
eisentrager,
the
court
assumed--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--your
honor,
respectfully,
i
don't
think
you
can
fairly
read
justice
jackson's
opinion
as
adopting
the
ahrens
v.
clark
position.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well...
in
any
event--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--in
any
event,
there
is
no
question
that
the
ahrens
v.
clark
rule
does
not
apply
today.
these
respondents
are
the
proper
respondents.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
your
honor,
as
to
the
absence
of
jurisdiction,
2241(c)(1)
could
not
be
plainer.
it's
been
plain
for
215
years.
if
there
is
federal
detention
and
there
is
a
proper
respondent
before
the
court
as
there
is,
there
is
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
i
don't
see
any,
even
ambiguity
in
that
statute.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
habeas,
you
mean
on
the
battlefield?
absolutely
not.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
in
the
zone
of
active
military
operations
or
in
an
occupied
area
under
martial
law,
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
has
never
extended.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
the--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--a
declared
war
and
someone
who
has
been
determined
to
be
a
combatant
in
accordance
with
article
v
of
the
geneva
convention,
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
those
circumstances
would,
under
rule
12(b)(6),
be
summarily
dismissed.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
it--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--it
depends
on
the
geneva
convention
and
on
the
military
regulations
duly
adopted
and
binding
on
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
no.
it
does
not.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
no.
our
position
is
that
the
habeas
corpus
statute
has
meant
what
it
said
since
1789.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
there
certainly
is,
your
honor,
but
since--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--i
have
more
to
say
about
it.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
that's
what
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
said.
now,
as
to
whether
or
not
that's
right--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--first
of
all--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--the
bare
jurisdictional
question
depends
on
federal
custody
simpliciter,
and
then
the
court
goes
on
to
decide,
is
there
any
legal
basis
for
the
government's
response
to
the
writ.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
your
honor,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
whether
you
call
it
jurisdiction
or
whether
you
call
it
the
merits,
in
the
battlefield
situation,
it's
going
to
go
out
under
rule
12,
in
any
event.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
when
he
sees
that
petition,
he
should
dismiss
it
summarily,
whether
he
dismisses
it
under
12(b)(1)
or
12(b)(6),
it
won't
take
him
any
more
time.
habeas
corpus,
as
the
historians'
brief,
and
others
among
the
amici
point
out,
has
never
run
to
the
battlefield,
as
a
matter
of
habeas
corpus
common
law.
and
it
is,
after
all,
a
common
law
writ.
it
has
never
run
to
any
place
except
where
the
sovereign
issuing
the
writ
has
some
undisputed
control.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes,
justice
kennedy...
kennedy,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
rely
on
some
mystical
ultimate
sovereignty
of
cuba
over,
as
we
navy
types
call
it,
gitmo,
treating
the
navy
base
there
as
a
no
law
zone.
now,
guantanamo
navy
base,
as
i
can
attest
from
a
year
of
personal
experience,
is
under
complete
united
states
control
and
has
been
for
a
century.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that's
exactly
what
it
says.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
that's
exactly
what
it
says...
yes.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
it
does
not
say
that.
it
says
that
if
the
united
states
decides
to
surrender
the
perpetual
lease,
cuba
has
ultimate
sovereignty,
whatever
that
means.
now,
for
lawyers
and
judges
dealing
with
the
word
sovereignty,
it
doesn't
self-define.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
yes.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
perhaps
one
of
my
colleagues
can
find
the
language
in
the
appendix.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
but,
for
example,
if
one
of
the
detainees
here
assaulted
another
detainee
in
guantanamo,
there
is
no
question
they
would
be
prosecuted
under
american
law
because
no
other
law
applies
there.
cuban
law
doesn't
apply
there.
now,
if
the
test
is
sovereignty,
that
term
must
be
given
some
rational
meaning
by
judges.
respondents
concede
that
habeas
corpus
would
extend
to
citizens
detained
in
guantanamo.
that
would
be
no
interference
with
cuban
sovereignty,
and
extending
habeas
corpus
to
noncitizens
there
is
no
more
an
interference
with
cuban
sovereignty.
if
there
isn't...
if
there
isn't
sovereignty
over
that
base
where
no
law
applies,
legislative,
judicial
or
otherwise,
the
term
has
no
meaning.
sovereignty
for
legal
purposes
must
at
least
mean
that
some
political
organization
has
a
monopoly
on
sanction
in
that
defined
geographic
area.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
i--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--i
misspoke,
justice
scalia,
by
omitting
the
reference
to
continuing.
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
that
continuing
sovereignty...
queen
elizabeth
is
the
nominal
sovereign
of
canada.
that
doesn't
determine
whether
or
not
canadian
courts
can
grant
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
she's
also
the
nominal
sovereign
of
australia.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
that's
the
point.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
but
if
the
reference
in
the
lease
meant
that
cuban
law
somehow
applied
in
the
united
states
navy
base
at
guantanamo
bay,
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
cuban
law
has
never
had
any
application
inside
that
base.
a
stamp
with
fidel
castro's
picture
on
it
wouldn't
get
a
letter
off
the
base.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
there
are
all
sorts
of
treaties
in
which
the
united
states,
or
perhaps
leases
in
other
respects,
in
which
the
united
states
limits
its
own
authority,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
united
states
has
surrendered
its
sovereignty.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
guantanamo
is
to
some
extent
unique.
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
served
a
united
states
navy
base
elsewhere
points
out
that
this
is
the
only
base,
for
example,
where
the
united
states
has
not
entered
into
a
status
of
forces...
forces
agreement.
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
we
have
exclusive
jurisdiction,
civil
jurisdiction
in
any
of
our
other
enclaves
in
foreign
countries.
but
we
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
control
over
civil
law
in
guantanamo,
and
have
had
for
a
century.
so
it's...
so
it's
so
totally
artificial
to
say
that
because
of
this
provision
in
the
lease,
the
executive
branch
can
create
a
no
law
zone
where
it
is
not
accountable
to
any
judiciary,
anywhere.
now,
in
some
other
places
where
the
united
states
has
a
base,
there
may
be
other
civil
authority
that
can
demand
an
accounting.
but
what
the
executive
branch
is
saying
here
is
we
don't
have
to
account
to
anyone,
anywhere.
justice
breyer,
you
asked
me
a
question
before,
and
someone
else,
that's
not
unusual,
interrupted
before
i
answered
you.
and
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
don't
remember
your
question
at
this
point.
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
well,
your
honor,
i
was
also
asked
a
question
about
whether
or
not
aliens
had
any
constitutional
rights.
in
verdugo,
speaking
for
four
members
of
the
court
at
least,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
said
that
eisentrager
stood
for
the
proposition
that--
mr.
john
j.
gibbons
--well,
he
did.
but
he
wrote
separately,
i
think,
and
at
least
cast
some
doubt
on
whether
or
not
he
agreed
with
your
position
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
right
for
an
alien
outside
the
united
states.
now,
of
course,
that
reading
of
eisentrager
assumes
that
it
was
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
not
a
jurisdictional
decision.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
our
position,
and
again,
it's
not
necessary
for
reversal
in
this
case,
and
perhaps
should
not
even
be
addressed
because
you
could
avoid
a
constitutional
decision
by
making
a
statutory
decision,
but
our
position
is
that
that
statement
in
verdugo
is
overbroad.
