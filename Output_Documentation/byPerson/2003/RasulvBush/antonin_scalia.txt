justice
antonin
scalia
1331.
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
what
i'm
asking.
is
that
here
or
not?
you
mentioned
the
apa
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
still
asserting
that,
are
you
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
also
13--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
we
have
two
things,
the
habeas
statute
and
1331?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
how
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
those
merits
question
go
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
it
may
well
be
that
if
those
factors
you
mentioned
were
changed,
you'd
be
entitled
to
judgment
here,
even
though
the
plaintiffs
in
eisentrager
were
not
entitled
to
judgment,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
the
merits
right
now.
we
are
talking
about
jurisdiction.
certainly
jurisdiction
doesn't
turn
on
the
merits
whether
you
were
an
enemy
alien
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it's
a
question
of
how
much
it
doesn't
apply,
whether
it
doesn't
apply
only
when
there
is
at
least
clear
statutory
jurisdiction
in
one,
in
one
federal
court
so
it's
almost
a
venue
call.
it
isn't
clear
that
it's
been
overruled
when
there
is
no
statutory
jurisdiction
in
any
federal
court.
that's
certainly
an
open
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
close
to
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
this,
mr.
gibbons.
if
the
jurisdictional
question
rests
on
habeas
statute
simpliciter,
without
reference
to
the
geneva
convention
or
any
of
the
other
merits
points
that
you've
been
raising,
how
then
do
you
answer
justice
kennedy's
question
if
the
merits
are
out
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
are
a
combatant
or
noncombatant,
is
there
jurisdiction
when
somebody
is
captured
on
the
field
of
battle
and
held
immediately
on
the
field
of
battle,
why
wouldn't
there
be
jurisdiction
there?
the
only
answers
you
give
are
merits
answers,
not
jurisdictional
answers.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
does
it
say
that,
cuba
has
ultimate
sovereignty
only
if
the
united
states
decides
to
surrender?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
would
that
text
be?
i
did
not
realize
that
was
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gibbons,
i'm
quoting
from
page
8
of
the
government's
brief,
which
i
assume
is
an
accurate
quote
of
the
treaty.
it
doesn't
just
say
that
cuba
has
sovereignty
if
we
give
up
the
lease.
it
says
the
united
states...
this
is
the
treaty,
recognizes
the
continuance
of
the
ultimate
sovereignty
of
the
republic
of
cuba
over
the
leased
area.
now
i
take
that
to
mean
that
they
are
sovereign
even
during
the
term
of
the
lease.
you
may
say
it's
artificial,
but
there
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
law
of
the
land,
as
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
sovereignty
is
being
used
in
the
same
sense.
i
mean,
it
would
be
a
good
point
if
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
said
that
england
was
sovereign
over
canada,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
would
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
couldn't
sublease--
--mr.
gibbons--
--could
we...
we
couldn't
sublease
gitmo
and
we
couldn't
sell
any
of
gitmo
to
a
foreign
country,
could
we?
why
not?
because
cuba
is
sovereign.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
cite
ahrens?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
recall.
justice
antonin
scalia
kind
of
extraordinary
if
it
was
relying
entirely
on
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
the
argument
is
available
that
in
that
situation,
the
constitution
requires
jurisdiction.
the
constitution
requires
that
an
american
citizen
who
has
the
protection
of
the
constitution
have
some
manner
of
vindicating
his
rights
under
the
constitution.
that
would
be
the
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
was
part
of
his
argument
in
eisentrager.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
using
it
to
say
what
the
law
was.
you're
using
it
to
show
that
there
was
available,
and
is
available,
a
perfectly
good
check
upon
the
executive
branch.
if
the
people
think
that
this
is
unfair,
if
congress
thinks
it's
unfair,
with
a
stroke
of
the
pen,
they
can
change
the
habeas
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
we
hold
hearings
to
determine
the
problems
that
are
bothering
you?
i
mean,
we
have
to
take
your
word
for
what
the
problems
are.
we
can't
call
witnesses
and
see
what
the
real
problems
are,
can
we,
in
creating
this
new
substantive
rule
that
we
are
going
to
let
the
courts
create.
congress
could
do
all
that,
though,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
wanted
to
change
the
habeas
statute,
it
could
make
all
sorts
of
refined
modifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
about
issues
that
we
know
nothing
whatever
about,
because
we
have
only
lawyers
before
us.
we
have
no
witnesses.
we
have
no
cross-examination,
we
have
no
investigative
staff.
and
we
should
be
the
ones,
justice
breyer
suggests,
to
draw
up
this
reticulated
system
to
preserve
our
military
from
intervention
by
the
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
olson,
there
is
a
whole
other
issue
in
this
case
which
you
have
not
addressed
and
i
don't
think
your
brief
much
addressed
it.
there
is
also
a
claim
of
jurisdiction
under
section
1331
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
will
you
say
at
least
a
few
words
about
what
your
response
to
that
is?
i
don't
even
see
the
apa
cited
in
your
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
goes
to
the
merits.
