justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
have
to
think
down
the
road,
is
there
an
alternative
to
the
geneva
convention
that
is
on
the
substantive
claim.
i
was
also
thinking,
and
here
i
want
your
view
on
it,
that
if
you
have,
if
they
get
in
the
door,
and
now
they
have
a
claim
that
they
are
being
held
without
a
competent
tribunal
assessing
it,
you
get
to
your
route
as
well
by
saying
that
the
part
about
the
fifth
amendment
in
eisentrager
is,
in
effect,
overruled
by
reid
v.
covert.
and
in
fact,
if
you
follow
harlan
and
by
following
harlan,
you
apply
some
kind
of
due
process,
and
the
geneva
convention
comes
in
to
inform
the
content
of
that
due
process.
now,
is
there
an
argument
there
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
simply
being
polite?
i
want
to--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
explore
it
with
the
solicitor
general
possibly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
obvious
that
there
is
language
in
eisentrager
that
supports
you,
obvious
to
me,
but
you
have
just
heard
that
judges
don't
always
distinguish
between
12(b)(1)
and
12(b)(6),
not
even
in
this
court,
at
least
we
don't
always
get
it
right.
and
there
is
also
language,
as
you
have
heard,
that's
against
you.
i
think
there
is
some
in
there.
so
what
i'm
thinking
now,
assuming
that
it's
very
hard
to
interpret
eisentrager,
is
that
if
we
go
with
you,
it
has
a
virtue
of
clarity.
there
is
a
clear
rule.
not
a
citizen,
outside
the
united
states,
you
don't
get
your
foot
in
the
door.
but
against
you
is
that
same
fact.
it
seems
rather
contrary
to
an
idea
of
a
constitution
with
three
branches
that
the
executive
would
be
free
to
do
whatever
they
want,
whatever
they
want
without
a
check.
that's
problem
one.
problem
two
is
that
we
have
several
hundred
years
of
british
history
where
the
cases
interpreting
habeas
corpus
said
to
the
contrary
anyway.
and
then
we
have
the
possibility
of
really
helping
you
with
what
you're
really
worried
about,
which
is
undue
court
interference
by
shaping
the
substantive
right
to
deal
with
all
those
problems
of
the
military
that
led
you
to
begin
your
talk
by
reminding
us
of
those
problems.
so
if
it's
that
choice,
why
not
say,
sure,
you
get
your
foot
in
the
door,
prisoners
in
guantanamo,
and
we'll
use
the
substantive
rights
to
work
out
something
that's
protective
but
practical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
grant
you
this.
my
question
has
to
assume
that
eisentrager
is
ambiguous
and
not
clearly
determinative.
but
then
on
that
assumption,
i'm
still
honestly
most
worried
about
the
fact
that
there
would
be
a
large
category
of
unchecked
and
uncheckable
actions
dealing
with
the
detention
of
individuals
that
are
being
held
in
a
place
where
america
has
power
to
do
everything.
now,
that's
what's
worrying
me
because
of
article
iii,
and
the
other
thing
on
the
opposite
side,
as
i
said,
is
it's
possible
to
tailor
the
substance
to
take
care
of
the
problems
that
are
worrying
you.
those
are
my
two
basic
points.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
battlefield,
i
might,
since...
all
i
mean
by
working
out
the
substantive
rights
is
what
justice
harlan
meant
and
what
justice
kennedy
meant
in
adopting
justice
harlan's
view
in
verdugo.
and
that
really
derives
from
the
insular
cases,
and
i
don't
think
it's
something
that
requires
witnesses
and
reticulated
whatever
they
are,
tax
cuts.
[laughter]
