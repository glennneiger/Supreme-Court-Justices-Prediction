justice
anthony

kennedy
so
they
would
have
had
a
habeas
corpus
entitlement,
in
your
view,
within
weeks
after
their,
after
their
detention?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
they
have
that
right
when
they
were
in
afghanistan?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
other
than
producing
the
person
before
the
court
so
that
the
system
is
satisfied
that
we
know
where
the
person
is,
surely
you
have
to
go
beyond
that
and
assert
some
sort
of
right.
and
you...
you
say
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
geneva
convention
is
really
not
the
basis
for
the
cause
of
action,
which
i
agree,
so
where
do
we
go
after
that?
so
he
is
here
in
front
of
the
court.
now
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
forgetting
the
geneva
convention,
what
happens
when
the
person
comes
before
the
court?
you
prevail
and
there
is
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
it
comes
here,
and
the
judge
says,
now
what
am
i
supposed
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
do
if
you
have
a
lawful
combatant
in
a
declared
war,
and
the
combatant,
an
enemy
of
the
united
states
is
captured
and
detained,
habeas?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we'll
take
it
from
the
battlefield,
and
a
week
later,
10
miles
away,
then
six
months
later,
a
thousand
miles
away.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it's
guantanamo.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
declared
war
and
a
lawful
combatant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
back
to
the
geneva
convention
again,
so
i
just
have
to
assume
your
case
depends
on
the
geneva
convention.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
self-executing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
at
guantanamo,
you
still
have
to
summarily
dismiss
under
the
hypothetical,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
gets
me
back
to
your
statement
that
if
this
had
been
a
citizen
held
in
guantanamo,
that
habeas
would
be
available.
but
the
statute
doesn't
talk
about
citizens.
it
says
prisoners
held
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states.
now,
if
the
citizen
can
say
that
he
is
a
prisoner
held
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
in
guantanamo,
why
couldn't
a
noncitizen
under
the
statute
say
the
same
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
only
way
we
can
do
it--
--i
don't,
i
don't
mean
to
misconstrue
it
or
to
misstate
it,
i
had
thought
you
said
at
the
outset
that
if
this
had
been
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
held
in
guantanamo,
there
would
be
habeas
corpus.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
go
outside
of
the
statutory
language
for
your
case
that's
in
front
of
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
going
outside
of
the
statutory
language
to
resolve
both
the
hypothetical
case
and
the
case
in
front
of
us.
this
is
a
prisoner,
and
he
is
detained
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states.
