chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
03-334,
shafiq
rasul
vs.
george
w.
bush
and
a
companion
case.
mr.
gibbons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gibbons,
i
understand
that
your
clients
have
been
detained
approximately
two
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
they
had
only
been
detained
six
months,
how
much
would
that
weaken
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
in
johnson
vs.
eisentrager,
we
said
that
the
geneva
convention
did
not
confer
a
private
right
of
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
johnson
said
quite
specifically
that
the
geneva
convention
was
not
available
to
the
petitioners
in
that
case
because
it
did
not
confer
any
right
of
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
several
different
places,
mr.
gibbons,
in
eisentrager,
the
court
says
that
we
are
talking
about
the
habeas
statute,
and
we
are
saying
these
petitioners
are
not
entitled
to
habeas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's,
that's
quite
different.
i
mean,
all
we
are
theoretically
talking
about
here
is
jurisdiction.
and
the
idea
that,
you
know,
you
have
justice
kennedy's
example,
a
lawful
combatant,
a
declared
war,
detained
at
guantanamo
maybe
two
months
after
he
is
captured,
and
an
action's
brought
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
habeas
corpus
and
what
does
a...
what
does
a
judge
say
when
he
considers
that
sort
of
petition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
it
also
says
cuba
retains
sovereignty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
i
was
speaking
for
five.
i
think
justice
kennedy
joined
the
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gibbons.
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
didn't
the
johnson
opinion
also
say,
we
don't
have
to
concern
ourselves
here
with
the
proper
custodian.
we
kind
of
finesse
that
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--our,
our
doctrine
would
have
to
be
applied
in
the
first
instance
by
800
different
district
judges,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
03-334,
rasul
v.
bush
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
