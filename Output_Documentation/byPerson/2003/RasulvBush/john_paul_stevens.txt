justice
john
paul
stevens
--wouldn't
that
depend
on
what
the
review
showed?
you
have
alleged
that
your
clients
were
not
enemy
aliens.
if
it
showed
they
were
tourists,
they
were
just
picked
up
by
mistake,
would
you
be
here
or
would
you
not
be
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
another
problem.
at
that
time,
that
case
was
decided
when
ahrens
against
clark
was
the
statement
of
the
law,
so
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
jurisdiction
there,
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
constitution
by
itself
provided
jurisdiction.
and
of
course,
all
that's
changed
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
raised
the
question
of
whether
the
territorial
jurisdiction
provision
covered
it.
there
was
no
territorial
jurisdiction
if
they
were
outside
the
district
under
the
ruling
in
ahrens
against
clark,
which
means
they
had
to
rely
on
the
constitution
to
support
jurisdiction,
which
in
turn
means
that
once
they
have
overruled
ahrens
against
clark,
which
they
did,
there
is
now
a
statutory
basis
for
jurisdiction
that
did
not
then
exist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
but
ahrens
v.
clark
was
the
law
at
the
time
of
that
decision,
and
it
was
subsequently
overruled.
so
that...
that
case
was
decided
when
the
legal
climate
was
different
than
it
has
been
since
ahrens
against
clark
was
overruled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
help
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
supposing
the
war
had
ended,
could
you
continue
to
detain
these
people
on
guantanamo?
would
there
then
be
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
existence
of
the
war
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
legal
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
your
position
does
not
depend
on
the
existence
of
a
war?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
sufficient
to
give
us
jurisdiction
over
guantanamo,
which
is
another
sovereign?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
american
citizen
was
in
the
middle
of
the
battlefield
in
iraq?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
really...
was
it
really
under
the
habeas
statute
or
under
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
the,
if
the
views
of
the
dissenters
in
ahrens
against
clark
were
the
law
at
that
time
as
they
perhaps
are
now,
then
there
would
have
been
statutory
jurisdiction,
which
was
not
present
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reason
it
said
that
was
because
ahrens
was
then
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
very
clear
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
they
rested
their
decision
solely
on
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
fact
case
was...
the
case
was
decided
when
the
majority
view
in
ahrens
was
the
law,
and
that
is
no
longer
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
context
of
the
case
was
it
was
decided
at
a
time
when
ahrens
against
clark
was
the
law.
and
if
the
dissenting
opinion
in
ahrens
against
clark
had
been
the
law,
it
would
have
been
decided
differently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
a
complete
response
to
an
argument
resting
entirely
on
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
to
contest
the
jurisdictional
objection.
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
whether
you
contest
it
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
not
construe
the
statute.
it
assumed
the
statute
was
inapplicable
and
concluded
that
the
constitution
was
not
a
substitute
for
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
a
word,
not
a
word
in
the
opinion
that
supports
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
cases
come
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
they
have
raised
a
narrow
but
important
question,
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
challenges
to
the
legality
of
the
detention
of
aliens
at
the
united
states
naval
base
in
guantanamo,
cuba?
the
petitioners
are
two
australians
and
12
kuwaiti
citizens
who
were
captured
abroad
during
the
military
campaign
in
afghanistan.
in
early
2002,
they
were
transferred
to
guantanamo.
they
have
been
held
there
in
military
custody
ever
since.
they
alleged
that
they
have
neither
plotted
nor
engaged
in
acts
of
aggression
against
the
united
states,
and
that
they
have
never
been
charged
with
wrongdoing.
the
respondents
are
federal
officials
who
have
control
over
our
facilities
in
guantanamo.
for
over
100
years,
the
untied
states
has
occupied
the
base,
which
comprises
45
square
miles
on
the
southeast
coast
of
cuba.
pursuant
to
a
lease
agreement
executed
with
the
newly
independent
republic
of
cuba
in
the
aftermath
of
the
spanish-american
war.
under
the
terms
of
the
lease,
cuba
retains
“ultimate
sovereignty”,
but
the
united
states
exercises
complete
jurisdiction
and
control
over
the
area
for
as
long
as
it
maintains
the
naval
base.
the
district
court
dismissed
petitioners’
actions
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
since
1868,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
has
provided
that
the
district
courts
have
power
to
issue
the
writ
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”.
in
the
typical
case,
both
the
prisoner
and
his
custodian
are
located
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
the
application
for
the
writ
is
filed.
in
such
cases,
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
is
perfectly
obvious.
after
world
war
ii
however,
cases
arose
in
which
the
prisoners
who
were
outside
the
district
where
the
custodian
was
located.
two
of
those
cases
ahrens
against
clark
decided
in
1948
and
johnson
against
eisentrager
decided
in
1950
are
a
special
relevance
to
our
decision
today.
indeed,
johnson
was
the
precedent
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
in
this
case.
in
ahrens,
a
120
germans
were
being
held
on
ellis
island,
new
york
for
deportation
to
germany,
pursuant
to
removal
orders
issued
by
attorney
general
tom
clark
filed
an
application
for
the
writ
in
the
district
of
columbia,
naming
clark
as
the
respondent.
this
court
construed
the
phrase,
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
to
require
that
the
persons
being
detained
must
be
located
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
the
application
was
dismissed,
because
the
detainees
were
in
new
york
rather
than
the
district.
three
justices
dissented
arguing
that
the
statute
merely
required
jurisdiction
over
the
custodian.
in
johnson,
again
over
the
dissent
of
three
justices,
the
court
held
that
a
federal
district
court
lacked
the
authority
to
issue
writs
of
habeas
corpus
on
behalf
of
a
group
of
german
citizens
who
had
been
captured
by
u.s.
forces
in
china
during
world
war
ii,
and
were
incarcerated
in
occupied
germany,
after
their
conviction
for
war
crimes
by
an
american
military
commission.
a
quarter
of
a
century
later
in
1973,
in
braden
against
the
30th
district,
the
court
once
again
over
the
dissent
of
three
justices,
overruled
ahrens
and
rejected
the
interpretation
of
the
statutory
phrase
within
their
respective
jurisdictions
that
had
provided
the
basis
for
the
decisions
in
ahrens
and
johnson.
under
braden,
the
jurisdiction
requirement
in
the
statute
is
satisfied
as
long
as
the
prisoners’
custodian
can
be
reached
by
service
of
process.
it
is
braden
rather
than
johnson
that
is
the
most
relevant
precedent
today.
moreover,
petitioners
in
this
case
differ
from
the
german
detainees
in
johnson
in
important
respects.
they
are
not
nationals
of
countries
at
war
with
the
united
states,
nor
are
they
admitted
combatants.
they
have
never
been
afforded
access
to
any
tribunal,
much
less
charged
with
and
convicted
of
wrongdoing.
for
more
than
two
years
they
have
been
imprisoned
in
an
area
subject
to
the
exclusive
and
plenary
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
respondents,
in
addition
to
their
misplaced
reliance
on
johnson,
argued
that
the
geographic
coverage
of
the
habeas
statute
should
be
limited
by
the
presumption
against
extraterritorial
application
of
federal
statutes.
that
presumption
however
is
inapplicable,
because
petitioners
are
being
detained
in
an
area
over
which
the
united
states
does
exercise
permanent
and
complete
jurisdiction
and
control.
moreover,
respondents
concede
that
the
statute
would
confer
jurisdiction
over
an
application
filed
by
an
american
citizen
held
at
guantanamo,
and
the
text
of
the
statute
draws
no
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens.
accordingly,
and
over
the
dissent
of
three
justices,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
