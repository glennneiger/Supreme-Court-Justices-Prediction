mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
is
at
war.
over
10,000
american
troops
are
in
afghanistan
today
in
response
to
a
virtually
unanimous
congressional
declaration
of
an
unusual
and
extraordinarily...
extraordinary
threat
to
our
national
security,
and
an
authorization
to
the
president
to
use
all
necessary
and
appropriate
force
to
deter
and
prevent
acts
of
terrorism
against
the
united
states.
it's
in
that
context
that
petitioners
ask
this
court
to
assert
jurisdiction
that
is
not
authorized
by
congress,
does
not
arise
from
the
constitution,
has
never
been
exercised
by
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
believe
that
there
would
not
be
jurisdiction,
just--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is
not
irrelevant,
because
it
is
in
this
context
that
that
question
is
raised,
and
i
would...
the
question,
the
case
of
johnson
vs.
eisentrager,
which
we
have
discussed
here,
even
the
dissent
in
that
case
said
that
it
would
be
fantastic
to
assume
that
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
would
exist
in
the
time
of
war.
so
that
that
case
is
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
doesn't
depend
upon
that,
justice
stevens,
but
it's
even
more
forceful.
and
more
compelling.
because
all
of
the
justices
in
the
eisentrager
case
would
have
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
have
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
would
acknowledge
jurisdiction.
the
court
has
never--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
would
acknowledge
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
for
the
reasons
that
are
explained
in
eisentrager
itself,
that
citizenship
is
a
foundation
for
a
relationship
between
the
nation
and
the
individual
and
a
foundation
for--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--with
respect
to
the
individual.
we
would,
we
would
still
argue--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
would
still
argue
that
the
jurisdiction
under
the
habeas
statute
would
not
extend
under
these
circumstances
to
a
wartime
situation,
justice
stevens,
but
that
the...
what
the
eisentrager
court
said,
that
there
is
enhanced
respect
with
respect
to
the
power
of
the
court
under
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
questions
involving
citizenship.
but
what
was
unquestionable
with
respect
to
that
case
is
that
an
alien
who
had
never
had
any
relationship
to
the
united
states
and
who
was
being
held
as
a
result
of
a
combat
situation
or
a
war
situation
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
under
the
habeas
statute.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
our
response
to
that
is
throughout
the
decision
in
eisentrager,
the
court
referred
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
starts--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
holding--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
held
that
there
was
no
relief
at
the
end
of
the
road,
because
the
ultimate
question,
to
use
the
words
of
the
court,
the
ultimate
question
is
jurisdiction.
the
court
over
and
over
again
said
that
we
are
deciding
how
far
the
habeas
statute
reaches.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
those
were
unquestionably
facts
that
related
to
the
case,
that
related
to
the
facts
that
came
to
the
court,
but
in
the
very
next
paragraph,
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
privilege
of
litigation
has
been
extended
to
aliens
whether
friendly
or
enemy,
that
specifically
addresses
one
of
the
points
you
mentioned,
only
because
permitting
their
presence
in
the
country
implied
protection.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
no
such
basis
can
be
invoked
here
for
these
prisoners
at
no
relevant
time
were
within
any
territory
over
which
the
united
states
is
sovereign,
and
the
scenes
of
their
offense,
their
capture,
their
trial
and
their
punishment
were
all
beyond
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
and
earlier
in
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
seems
to
me...
it
seems
to
me
that
those
statements
all
have
to
be
read
in
the
context...
context
of
the
court
saying
the
ultimate
question
is
jurisdiction.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
suspect
that
there
are
many
decisions
of
this
court
where,
when
the
court
is
dealing
with
the
facts
of
a
specific
case,
especially
in
the
context
of
a
court
of
appeals
decision,
if
the
court
were
to
turn
to
the
briefs
that
were
written
before
to
present
the
issue
in
this
court,
the
only...
the
question
presented,
submitted
in
this
case,
in
this
court,
in
eisentrager
was
the
jurisdiction
under
the
habeas
statute.
but
the
case
arose
in
the
context
where
the
court
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
was--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
the
court
was
specifically
focusing
on
the
jurisdictional
incidents
attached
to
the
condition
of
the
individual--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
court
specifically
did
say,
but
did
not
mention
the
statute,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
statute
is
mentioned
throughout
the
briefs,
in
the
government's
brief
when
it
says
what...
the
statute
at
issue,
the
habeas
corpus
statute
and
within
its
territory,
the
language
of
part
a.
the
statute
that
exists
today
is
the
same
statute
that
the
eisentrager
court
was
considering.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
seems
to
me
again
the
entire
opinion
has
to
be
taken
in
context.
the
court
did
specifically
say
that
there
is
no
statutory
authority.
it
didn't
say,
it
didn't
identify
by
number
a
provision
of
the
code,
but
it
specifically
said
no
statutory
authority.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
justice
stevens,
i
submit
that
in
the
context
of
the
case,
in
the
context
of
the
way
the
dissent
understood
it,
as
well
as
the
majority
understood
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
we
would
submit
that
ahrens,
the
over...
partial
overruling,
i
think,
has
been
pointed
out
before.
ahrens
has
no
effect
on
the
vitality
of
the
eisentrager
case.
the
court
made
clear
that
it
was
deciding...
and
everyone...
the
reason
i
mentioned
the
briefs
is
the
context
in
which
the
case
was
presented
to
the
court,
and
argued
to
the
court
and
the
decision
that
was
made
by
the
majority
in
the
court,
focusing
on
the
identity
of
the
petitioner,
whether
alien
or
friendly.
justice
black
in
his
dissenting
opinion
says
this
decision
would
apply
to
whether
someone
was
hostile
or
not,
and
the
entire
context
of
the
case,
justice
stevens,
it
seems
to
me,
and
does
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
case
goes
much
further
than
that,
because
the
court
was
not
focusing
on
that.
it
didn't
specify
that
it
was
making
its
decision
on
that
basis.
it
did
specify
over
and
over
again,
and
the
dissent
referred
to
this
as
well,
that
it
was
focusing
on
the
fact
that
the
individuals
bringing
the
petition
had
no
sufficient
contacts
with
the
united
states.
that's
in
part
why
the
court
distinguished--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
did
not,
as
i'm--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
recall
that
it
did.
the
district
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
district
court
relied
upon
that
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
went
much
further
with
respect
to...
in
fact,
the
court,
and
this
court,
justice
jackson's
opinion
for
the
court
in
this
case
specifically
points
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
back
to
something
it
called
fundamentals,
because
it
couldn't
find
any
authority
in
either
the
statute
or
the
constitution.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
believe
that's
a
correct
characterization.
what...
the
other
portion
of
the
decision
that
it
seems
to
me
important
to
recognize
is
that
this
is
a
decision
that
was
widely
perceived,
and
has
been
consistently
perceived,
as
a
definition
of
the
scope
of
the
habeas
statute.
going
back
to
the
early
1800s,
this
court
decided
that
the
extent
of
habeas
jurisdiction
arose
from
the
statute,
not
from
the
common
law.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
the
answer
to
that
is,
in
the
first
place,
we
are
not,
we
are
not
saying
that
there
necessarily
would
be
jurisdiction
there,
but
we
are
saying
that
the
court...
that
the
court
would
go
further
with
respect
to
that
because,
and
this
is
also
in
eisentrager
and
a
number
of
other
court's...
of
this
court's
decisions,
that
the
court
will
find
more
protection
for
citizens
as
a
result
of
the
relationship
going
back--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
are
not...
we
are
saying
that
we
would
not
be
contesting
it,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
court
will
be
dealing
with
other
issues
involving
citizens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
guess
the
only
way
i
can
answer
this,
justice
stevens,
is
to
say
that
what
the
court
seemed
to
say,
not
only
in
the
majority
opinion,
but
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
that
more
rights
would
be
given
to
citizens--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
that
does
not
necessarily
follow.
the
court
has
not
reached
that
decision
yet,
and
that's
something
that
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
and
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
it
was...
and
in
that
case,
the
court
specifically
said
the
fifth
amendment
did
not
extend
to
the
petitioners
in
that
case.
the
court
has
said
that
again
in
the
verdugo
case
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
it
would
be
an
interpretation.
and
what
this
court
is
doing
is
interpreting
the
statute
because
the
habeas
corpus
statute
defines
the
extent
of
rights--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--our
answer
to
that
question,
justice
souter,
is
that
citizens
of
the
united
states,
because
of
their
constitutional
circumstances,
may
have
greater
rights
with
respect
to
the
scope
and
reach
of
the
habeas
statute
as
the
court
has
or
would
interpret
it.
that
case
has
never
come
before
this
court,
and
it's
important
to
emphasize
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--excuse
me,
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
this
court
construed
those
provisions
in
the
eisentrager
case
and
determined
that
the
statute
did
not
reach
aliens
that
did
have
no
contact
with
the
united
states
and
were
held
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
outside
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
justice
stevens,
i
respectfully
disagree.
i
think
the
court
was
construing
the
statute
not
to
be
applicable,
then
it
went
on
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
addressed
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
respectfully
disagree.
the
court
does
say,
we
don't
find
any
authority
in
the
statute.
we
don't
find
any
authority
in
the
constitution.
we
will
not
go
to
so-called
fundamentals
to
find
it
someplace
else.
that
is
consistent
with
what
this
court
decided
in
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
justice
breyer,
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
you
started
with
the
proposition
that
there
was
no
check
and
that
the
executive
is
asserting
no
check.
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
a
habeas
statute.
congress
had...
has
had
54
years
with
full
awareness
of
the
decision
to
change
it.
indeed,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
eight
months
after
the
eisentrager
decision,
a
bill
was
introduced
that
would
have
changed
that
statute,
h.r.
2812,
which
would
specifically
have
changed
the
statute
to
deal
with
the
eisentrager
situation,
so
there
is
a
check.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
understand
that,
but
the
bill
was...
came
eight
months
after
eisentrager.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
precisely
correct.
and
they
had
a
bill
before
them
eight
months
after
the
eisentrager
decision
which
had...
that
congress
proceeded
on
it.
congress
has
also
dealt
with
the
habeas
statute
in
a
variety
of
other
ways.
it
has
seen
fit
in
no
way
to
change
the
decision
required
by
this
court
with
respect
to
the
statute.
you
mentioned
several
hundred
years
of
british
history
was
your
second
point.
all
of
those
cases,
or
virtually
all
of
those
same
cases
that
have
been
brought
up
in
the
briefs,
and
the
amicus
briefs
today,
were
in
the
briefs
that
were
before
the
eisentrager--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
let
me
get
back
to
it
again.
those
earlier
cases
were
decided
and
rejected
in
eisen...
in
the
eisentrager
case.
whether
there
is
a
check
on
the
executive,
there
is
a
congressional
check
through
the
power
of
legislation,
through
the
power
of
oversight,
through
the
power
of
appropriations.
there
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--congress
could
do
all
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
could--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
we
would
agree
with
that
and
we
would
emphasize
the
point
that
stepping
across
that
line
would
be
impossible
to
go
back
from
with
respect
to
prisoners
in
the
battlefield.
in
fact,
the
reply
brief
refers
to
the
front
lines
in
iraq,
in
a
battle
station
in
iraq.
we
are
talking
here
about
battlefield
decisions
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
would
say,
the
executive,
you
must
give
a
military
process
because
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
first
of
all,
demanded
in
their
petition
and
they
would
have
a
right
to
raise
these
issues
to
the
extent
they
have
not
backed
off
in
this
case,
but
they
demanded
in
their
petition,
their
release,
unmonitored
communications
with
counsel,
cessation
of
interrogations,
evidentiary
hearings.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
is
no
question
that
that
is
exactly
right.
and
to
the
extent
that
what
the
petitioners
are
seeking
is
to
oversee
the
circumstances...
this
is
the
language
in
their
brief,
to
oversee
the
circumstances
of
detention.
that
is
going
to
vary
from
case
to
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
justice
ginsburg,
the
relief
that
i
was
articulating
is
what
they
asked
for
in
the
first
instance.
if
they
have
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
the
next
petitioner
doesn't
have
to
say
well,
i
only
want
a
process.
and
if
they
only
want...
now
they
are
saying
they
only
want
an
executive
branch
process
to
review.
as
we
explained--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
we
would.
because
we
are
talking
about
territorial
sovereign
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
what...
what
exists
in
guantanamo
is
no
different
than
existed
in
lansberg
prison
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is,
it
is
the
line
that
this
court
drew
and
repeatedly
articulated--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
it
is
a
line
that
is,
is...
has
the
virtue
of
what
justice
breyer
was
talking
about,
of
having
relative
certainty.
it
is
a
line
that's
defined
by
state
to
state
relationships.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
complete
jurisdiction
is
a
phrase
in
that
lease,
the
lease
specifically
says
that
ultimate
sovereignty
is
cuba's.
it
specifically
says
that
the
united
states--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--with
respect...
the
lease
restricts
the
ability
of
the
united
states
to
use
that
property
for
only
naval
or
coaling
purposes.
it
specifically
says
it
may
not
be
used
for
any
other
purpose.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
is
cited
in
the
brief,
and
we
explain
that
the
president
is
not
an
agency
under
the
apa,
that
the
united
states
military
with
respect
to
operations
and
military
operations
are
specifically
exempted
by
the
apa.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
that
the
fundamental
nature
of
what
the
petitioners
are
seeking
here
is
the
review
of
the
nature
and
status
of
their
detention,
which
sounds
in...
and
is
examined
by
this
court
repeatedly
under
the
doctrine
of
habeas
corpus.
and
that
there
is
no
foundation.
in
fact,
i
submit
that
the
way
the
briefs
have
been
written,
the
petitioners
don't
even
feel
strongly
about
the
apa
position.
what
they
are
talking
about,
and
why
most
of
their
briefs
explain,
they
are
focusing
on
fundamental
habeas
corpus
as
it
existed
throughout
the
centuries.
what
is
important
to
emphasize
here
with
respect
to
all
of
these
questions,
with
respect
to,
well,
how
much
control
would
there
be,
how
much
control
would
there
be
in
guantanamo
versus
a
place
in
afghanistan
or
another
place--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
canal
zone
was
treated
differently
by
congress.
congress
created,
applied,
under
its
responsibility
with
respect
to
territorial
and
insular
or
unincorporated
territory,
applied
laws
there,
put
a
court
there.
so
it's
very
different
than
the
canal
zone.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
it
is...
because
it
is
a...
in
the
first
place,
the
question
of
sovereignty
is
a
political
decision.
it
would
be
remarkable
for
the
judiciary
to
start
deciding
where
the
united
states
is
sovereign
and
where
the
united
states
has
control--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
have
that,
justice
ginsburg,
in
every
place
where
we
would
put
military
detainees,
in
a
field
of
combat
where
there
are
prisons
in
afghanistan
where
we
have
complete
control
with
respect
to
the
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
court
actually
heard
a
case,
neely
vs.
henkel,
in
1901,
which
specifically
addressed
that,
and
held
that
the
united
states
did
not
have
sovereignty
for
the
enforcement
of
its
laws
in
guantanamo.
and
at
that
point--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--with
respect
to
a
certain
area,
a
military
base
in
germany,
a
military
base
in
afghanistan,
the
united
states
must
have
and
does
exercise
relatively
complete
control.
every
argument
that's
being
made
here
today
could
be
made
by
the
two
million
persons
that
were
in
custody
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii,
and
judges
would
have
to
decide
the
circumstances
of
their
detention,
whether
there
had
been
adequate
military
process,
what
control
existed
over
the
territory
in
which
they
were
being
kept.
what
this
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
is
a
great
deal
of
differences
in
connection
with
every
area
over
which
the
united
states
has
some
degree
of
control.
the
degree
of
control
that
it
has
here
is
limited
to
specific
purposes
in...
with
respect
to
the
sovereignty
of
cuba.
