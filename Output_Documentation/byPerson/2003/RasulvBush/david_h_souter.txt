justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
still
win.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
win
under
the
habeas
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
you
don't
need
both.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
--but
i
take
it
you
are--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
your...
may
i,
may
i
ask
you
this,
because
i'm
having
the
trouble
justice
scalia
is
having.
i
thought
your
principal
argument
on
the
basis
of
eisentrager
was
that
it
cannot
stand
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
because
in
fact,
in
eisentrager,
there
was
enough
mention
of
matters
on
the
merits
so
that
it
was
clear
that's
what
was
driving
the
ultimate
resolution
in
eisentrager.
and
it
cannot
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
court
cannot
even
inquire,
and
the
only
issue
we
have
got
is
whether
under
the
habeas
statute
the
court
can
even
inquire.
do
i
misunderstand
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
the
merits
case
that
you
are
talking
about?
i
mean,
your
jurisdictional
argument
doesn't
depend,
as
i
understand
it,
on
military
regulations
or
the
geneva
convention.
it
depends
on
this
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
get
into
court,
your
clients
may
raise
geneva
convention
and
all
sorts
of
things,
but
that's
not
what
your
case
here
depends
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
clear
that
there
was
no
relief.
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
gibbons'
position
that
because
in
fact
they
did
discuss
the
merits,
that
case
cannot
really
be
taken
as
authority
for
the...
leaving
ahrens
and
braden
aside,
that
the
case
cannot
be
taken
as
authority
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
allowing
the
person
through
the
door
to
make
whatever
claim
the
person
wants
to
make.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
it
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
really
not
asking
a
question
about,
frankly,
about
the
court's
terminology.
i'm
asking
about
the
holding
in
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
mere
argument
is
you
can't
say
it
held
anything
more
than
that
there
was
no
relief
at
the
end
of
the
road.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
briefs
may
have
mentioned
it,
but
wasn't
the
problem
that
eisentrager
had
to
confront,
the
problem
created
by
ahrens,
construing
respective
jurisdiction,
and
therefore,
the
only
way
there
could
be
habeas
jurisdiction
in
eisentrager
was
if
due
process
demanded
it.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
well,
there
are
various
reasons
why
there
is
no
ultimate
due
process
entitlement,
and
therefore,
due
process
does
not
demand
entertainment
of
jurisdiction.
after
braden,
that
argument
is
gone.
why,
therefore,
is
eisentrager
not
undercut
to
the
point
where
it's
no
further
authority
on
the
jurisdictional
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there
are
no
rights
that
can
be
recognized
unless
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place.
and
if
the
court
is
going
to
make
good
on
what
you
have
just
said
it
said,
it
has
got
to
do
so
presupposing
jurisdiction.
so
if
you
are
going
to
rely
upon
those
statements,
don't
you
necessarily
have
to
concede
jurisdiction?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
the
citizen?
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
they
have
got
lots
of
rights
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
get
into
a
court
to
enforce
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction
because
due
process
would
require
it
for
citizens,
but
there
would
not
be
statutory
jurisdiction
in
the
case
of
the
citizen
at
guantanamo?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
what
is
the
position...
i
mean,
i
want
to
know
what
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
for
the
same
reason
justice
kennedy
does.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that,
why
is
that
crucial?
i
mean,
it's
not
crucial,
i
take
it,
under
the
respective
jurisdiction
clause
of
2241.
is
it
crucial
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
is
it
a
good
line?
i
mean,
what
is...
what
is
the
justification?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
those...
afghanistan
is
not
a
place
where
american
law
is,
and
for
a
century,
has
customarily
been
applied
to
all
aspects
of
life.
we
even
protect
the
cuban
iguana.
we
bring...
in
bringing
people
from
afghanistan
or
wherever
they
were
brought
to
guantanamo,
we
are
doing
in
functional
terms
exactly
what
we
would
do
if
we
brought
them
to
the
district
of
columbia,
in
a
functional
sense,
leaving
aside
the
metaphysics
of
ultimate
sovereignty.
if
the
metaphysics
of
ultimate
sovereignty
do
not
preclude
us
from
doing
what
we
have
been
doing
for
the
last
100
years,
why
is
it
a
bar
to
the
exercise
of
judicial
jurisdiction
under
the
habeas
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
we've
been
doing
a
pretty
good
job
of
it
since
then,
am
i
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
that
there
is
no
statutory
regime
that
applies
to
guantanamo
which
is
different
from
the
statutory
or
legal
regime
that
applied
to
occupied
territories
after
world
war
ii
or
indeed
that
applies
to
territory
under
the
control
of
the
american
military
in
afghanistan
or
iraq?
