justice

but
you
do
have
the
impediment,
mr.
gibbons,
that
the
d.c.
circuit
said
it
decided
the
merits
as
well
as
jurisdiction,
so
i
think
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy
were
asking
you
before,
well,
if
you
prevail
on
jurisdiction
under
that
opinion,
don't
you
go
out
the
door
immediately
because
the
d.c.
circuit
said,
at
least
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
nonresident
aliens
have
no
due
process
rights.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
the
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whether...
as
i
take
it
we
ask
you
to
address
only
the
bare
jurisdictional
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't
need
your
personal
experience.
that's
what
it
says
in
the
treaty.
it
says
complete
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
complete
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
like
a
federal
enclave
within
a
state?
i
was
trying
to
think
of
anything
that
might
be...
resemble
this
relationship
of
the
united
states
to
a
territory
inside
another
territory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
olson,
would
you
look
at
page
777
of
the
johnson
v.
eisentrager
opinion,
and
it
says...
this
is
a
hard
opinion
to
fathom,
but
it
does
say
we
are
here
confronted
with,
and
there
is
a
whole
list
of
things.
and
one
of
them
is,
is
an
enemy
alien,
and
another
is,
was
tried
and
convicted
by
a
military
commission
sitting
outside
the
united
states.
why
would
the
court
think
it
necessary
to
say
this
is
what
we
confronted
in
this
case
which
makes
it
worlds
different
from
our
case,
where
there
has
been
no
trial
and
conviction,
where
these
people
are
saying,
and
we
must
accept
for
the
moment
that
it's
true,
that
they
are
innocents.
that
they
are
not
combatants
of
any
kind.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
their
trial
and
their
punishment.
this
is
a
completed
episode.
this
is
a
very
difficult
decision
to
understand.
i
would
say
it's
at
least
ambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
so
unnecessary
to
say,
to
give
that
list
that
appears
on
page
777.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could
have
been
just
a
clarifying,
general
olson.
as
you
well
know,
the
fact
that
a
bill
was
introduced
and
not
passed
carries
very
little
weight
on
what
law
that
exists
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
olson,
i
have
looked
at
the
reply
brief,
which
is
the
last
chance
to
say
what
they
mean.
and
they
say
we
are
not
asking
for
any
of
those
things,
and
certainly
not
asking
to
have
a
lawyer
there
while
these
people
are
being
interrogated.
they
are
saying,
look,
we
are
claiming
that
our
people
are
innocents.
and
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding,
we
must
assume
that.
and
all
we
want
is
some
process
to
determine
whether
they
are
indeed
innocent,
and
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
court
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
go
back
to
the
jurisdiction,
so
i
understand
really
what
your
argument
is.
would
this
be
entirely
different,
as
far
as
their
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
if
we
were
talking
about...
if
the
people
were
prisoners
on
ellis
island
or
in
puerto
rico?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
does
it
have
complete
jurisdiction?
no
one
else
has
jurisdiction.
complete
jurisdiction
of
satisfactory
lines.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
years
have
we
been
operating
in
guantanamo
with
cuban
law
never
applying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
guantanamo,
everyone
agrees,
is
an
animal,
there
is
no
other
like
it.
the
closest
would
be
the
canal
zone,
i
suppose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
this
like,
as
i
asked
mr.
gibbons,
a
federal
enclave
within
a
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
word
is
physical
control,
power.
