well,
i
guess,
at
least
the
question
presented
is
just
whether
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
under
the
habeas
statute,
section
2241,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
raise
the
issue
of
any
potential
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
constitution
alone.
we
are
here
debating
the
jurisdiction
under
the
habeas
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
may
not
be
self-executing.
that's
the
problem,
i
guess.
the
indications
are
it's
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
you,
if
you,
if
your
clients
here
had
been
given
the
review
that
has
been
described
to
us
in
the
government's
brief,
by
military
authorities
to
determine
whether
these
people
are
indeed
being
held
as
enemy
combatants,
would
you
be
here
if
you
knew
that
that
review
had
been
provided?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
one
of
the
plaintiffs
were
an
american
citizen
here,
being
held
in
guantanamo.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
jurisdiction
under
habeas
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
eisentrager
court
never
once
mentioned
the
statute,
the
habeas
statute
in
its
opinion.
what
it
seemed
to
do
was
to
reach
the
merits
and
say
at
the
end
of
the
day,
these
people
have
no
rights.
they
have
had
a
trial
under
the
military
tribunal
and
they
have
no
rights
that
could
be
granted
at
the
end
of
the
day,
and
no
mention
of
the
habeas
statute.
