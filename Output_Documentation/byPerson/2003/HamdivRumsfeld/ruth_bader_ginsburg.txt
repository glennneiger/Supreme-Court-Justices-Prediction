justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned,
you
mentioned
in
connection
with
quirin
that
there
was
a
statute,
and
i
think
one...
one
of
the
defendants
was
alleged
to
be
a
u.s.
citizen.
so
i
thought
you
were
making
what...
were
there
regimes
in
prior
wars
for
entertaining
the
claims
of
people
who
said,
i
was
an
innocent
bystander,
i
was
indeed
captured
by
the
enemy.
in
vietnam
and
world
war
ii,
were
there
means
to
entertain
the
claims
of
people
who
said,
i
wasn't
an
enemy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
those
military
proceedings
satisfy
your
claim?
your
point
is
that
hamdi
has
not
had
a
chance
to
be
heard
on
his
claim
that
this
was
a
dreadful
mistake,
i
wasn't
an
enemy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
a
reason
given...
when
the
district
judge
suggested
that
solution,
why
did
the
government
say,
we
don't
want
to
use
the
procedure
that
we
used,
say,
in
vietnam?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
procedure...
does
that
have...
did
congress
have
a
part
in
that,
the
military
regulations
that
provided
for
how
you
treat
people
in
wartime
situations
who
say,
i'm
innocent
essentially?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dunham,
one
of
the
judges
on
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
en
banc
denial,
judge
mock,
had
a
proposal
that
was
similar
to
the
one
that
judge
mukasey
proposed
in
new
york.
and
that
is,
initially,
the
mobbs
affidavit
is
taken
as
true
but
that
you
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut
it.
would
that
be
a
satisfactory...
would
that
comport
with
due
process
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
criminal
procedure
or
this
detention
without...
does
the
government
have
any
rhyme
or
rationale
as
to
why
some
of
these
people...
i
think
mr.
dunham
mentioned
lindh,
there
is
also
moussaoui,
there
is
this
john...
they
are
also
being
kept
away
from
returning
any
place
because
there
are
criminal
charges
against
them.
and
then
there
is
hamdi
and
padilla
and
almorai
who
are
in
this
detention
state
with
no
charges.
what
does
the
government...
how
does
the
government
justify
some
going
through
the
criminal
process
and
others
just
being
held
indefinitely?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any--
--in
quirin,
in
quirin,
the
defendants
were
heard,
and
that's...
the
mobbs
affidavit
is,
i
take
it
your
position
is,
yes,
habeas,
and
yes,
the
government
has
to
come
forward
with
something.
and
the
something
they
came
forward
with
is
the
mobbs
affidavit,
which
is
hearsay,
because
mobbs
doesn't
know
what
happened
on
the
battlefield
either.
and
that
there
is
no
statement
at
any
point
from
hamdi,
although
the
claim
before
us
is
that
he
would
dispute
what's
in
the
mobbs
affidavit,
but
he
doesn't
have
an
opportunity
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that
certainly
is
double
hearsay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
person
who
is
locked
up,
doesn't
he
have
a
right
to
bring
before
some
tribunal
himself
his
own
words,
rather
than
have
a
government
agent
say
what
was
told
to
him
that
somebody
else
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
something
about
self-executing.
in
connection
with
the
geneva
convention,
you
said,
well,
it's
not
self-executing.
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
torture
convention?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
we
don't
have
yet.
it's
still
on
the
drawing
board,
the
annual
review.
