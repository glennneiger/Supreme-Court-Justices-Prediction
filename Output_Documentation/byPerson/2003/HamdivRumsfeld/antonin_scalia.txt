justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
an
english
word.
it
means
somebody
who
is
combatting.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
it
means
someone
who
is...
has
taken
up
arms
against
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
isn't
that...
really,
do
we
have
to
quibble
about
that
word?
justice
antonin
scalia
happening.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about,
about
noncitizen
combatants.
i
mean,
anyone
captured
in
a
war
could
say,
you
got
the
wrong
man.
i,
in
fact,
was
not
taking
up
arms
against
the
united
states,
and
i
insist
upon
a
judicial
proceeding
to
let
me
make
that
point.
now,
you
surely
wouldn't
allow
every
captured
enemy
in
a
war
to
go
through
a
habeas
proceeding
because
he
wants
to
challenge
the
fact,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
would
you?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
you
expect
the
military
to
do?
as
i
understand
it,
he
wasn't
even
captured
by
our
own
forces.
he
was
captured
by
allied
forces
and
turned
over
to
our
forces.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
want
them
to
run
down
the
members
of
the
afghan
allies
who
captured
this
man
and
get
them
to
testify
in
a
proceeding?
it's
just
putting
unreasonable
demands
upon,
upon
a
war
situation.
i
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
get
a
deposition
from
an
american
colonel
who
says
this
prisoner
was
turned
over
to
me
by
allied
forces,
our
afghan
allies
in
this
combat,
and
i
was
assured
by
them
that
they
had
captured
him
in
a
firefight?
now,
is
that
going
to
satisfy
our
habeas
corpus
review?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
certainly
would,
but
you
wouldn't
accept
that,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you
wouldn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
reviewable
on
habeas?
you
are
not
saying
that
it
would
be
an
adequate
defense
in
a
subsequent
habeas
position
simply
to
say
there
was
a
hearing
of
the
kind
prescribed
in
the
military
regulations,
and
after
that
hearing,
he
was
found
to
be
an
enemy
combatant.
that
would
not
satisfy
you?
you
would
allow
the
habeas
court
to
re-examine
the
facts
brought
up
in
that
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
fair,
of
course,
and
what,
you
know,
what
common
law
courts
usually
mean
by
fair,
for
example,
is
no
hearsay
testimony.
and
you
apply
that
rule
to
a
wartime
situation
and
everybody
will
get
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that's
different.
i
thought
you
said
that
he
would
look
to
see
whether
those
regulations
were
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
something
quite
different
from
saying
they
followed
the
regulations.
the
regulations
might
be
something
that
a
common
law
judge
thinks
does
not
comply
with
due
process.
in
that
case,
you
would
override
the
military
judgment,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
inherently,
i
mean,
certainly,
you
know,
when
there
is
a
declaration
of
war
or
a
resolution
such
as
this,
surely
the
president
has
the
right
to
kill
foreign
combatants,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
it
conceivable
that
he
has
to
kill
them
but
not
to
detain
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
every
united
states
citizen,
even
if
they're
captured
on
the
field
of
combat,
is
entitled
to
a
habeas
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
right.
he's
entitled
to
a
habeas
hearing
to
determine
whether
in
fact
he
was
captured
on
the
field
of
combat
opposing
the
united
states,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
presume
that
anybody
who
claims
to
be
an
american
citizen
would
be
entitled
to
a
habeas
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
he
is
in
fact
an
american
citizen,
and
then
the
subsequent
question
of
whether
he
was
captured
on
the
field
of
combat
while
taking
up
arms
against
the
united
states,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
every
foreigner
captured,
if
he
claims
to
be
an
american
citizen,
would
be
entitled
to
the
kind
of
habeas
hearing
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
principle
that
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
and
how
it
would
apply.
i
mean,
if
there
is
a
habeas
corpus
right
for
an
american
citizen,
there
has
to
be,
it
seems
to
me,
a
habeas
corpus
right
for
everyone
who
claims
he
is
an
american
citizen.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
it's
been
there
since
the
country
was
founded
when
he
was
captured
on
the
field
of
battle
is
the
very
controverted
question
that's
up
here.
you
can't
say
that
with
that
assurance.
i
mean,
that's
why
we
have
a
case
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
it
expires
after
two
and
a
half
years,
it
would
just
not
mean
you
have
to
give
them
counsel
after
two
and
a
half
years
or
give
them
a
hearing
after
two
and
a
half
years.
it
means
you
would
have
to
let
them
go
back
to
afghanistan
after
two
and
a
half
years,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
filed
a
dissent
in
this
case
with
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
the
plurality
opinion
today,
which
has
become
the
judgment
of
the
court,
permits
the
imprisonment
for
what
the
constitution
defines
as
treason
without
jury
trial
of
an
american
citizen
who
protests
his
innocence
of
that
effects.
in
our
view,
this
contradicts
a
long
tradition
of
anglo-american
law
and
sets
a
dangerous
precedent
for
the
future.
two
provisions
of
the
constitution
are
relevant:
the
first
guarantees
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law;
where
the
deprivation
of
liberty
consists
of
incarceration
for
acts
that
the
law
makes
criminal
as
opposed
to,
for
example,
quarantine
for
communicable
disease
or
commitment
for
insanity,
due
process
has
always
required
the
finding
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
a
public
trial
before
a
jury.
where
the
government
has
sought
to
imprison
the
citizen
without
that
due
process,
a
second
provision
of
the
constitution
has
come
into
play,
the
guarantee
of
the
great
writ,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
that
is
the
traditional
means
by
which
those
imprisoned
without
due
process
have
obtained
their
freedom.
the
central
question
in
the
present
case
is
whether
there
is
a
different
special
procedure
for
imprisonment
of
a
citizen
accused
of
wrongdoing
by
fighting
on
the
enemy’s
side
in
war
time.
a
plurality
of
this
court
asserts
the
captured
enemy
combatants
have
traditionally
been
detained
until
the
cessation
of
hostilities
and
then
released.
that
is
an
accurate
description
of
war
time
practice
with
respect
to
enemy
aliens.
the
tradition
with
respect
to
american
citizens
however,
has
been
quite
different.
citizens
aiding
the
enemy
have
been
treated
as
traitors
subject
to
the
criminal
process.
in
england,
as
early
as
1350,
the
statute
of
treason
made
at
the
crime
to
levy
war
against
the
king.
subjects
accused
of
doing
so
were
routinely
prosecuted
for
treason.
the
founders
inherited
that
tradition,
which
is
why
our
constitution
contains
a
treason
clause.
this
defines
treason,
as
among
other
things,
levying
war
against
the
united
states,
and
it
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
convicted
of
that
crime
unless
on
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses
to
the
same
overt
act
or
on
confession
in
open
court.
quite
clearly,
a
citizen’s
levying
war
against
the
united
states
was
to
be
punished
criminal.
there
are
undoubtedly
times
when
military
exigency
requires
detention
of
a
citizen
without
criminal
charge.
in
england,
before
the
founding,
parliament
on
numerous
occasions
passed
temporary
suspensions
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
times
of
threatened
invasion
or
rebellion
including,
during
the
american
revolution.
our
federal
constitutions
guarantee
of
habeas
corpus
contains
a
provision
explicitly
permitting
suspension
but
limiting
the
situations
in
which
it
may
be
invoked.
it
reads
“the
privilege
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
be
suspended
unless
when
in
cases
of
rebellion
or
invasion,
the
public
safety
may
require
it.”
this
suspension
clause
was
used
for
the
first
time
during
the
civil
war
when
congress
passed
a
law
authorizing
executive
suspension
of
the
writ
and
it
has
been
used
on
several
occasions
since.
and
that
is
in
a
nutshell
what
this
case
is
about.
whether
in
the
current
war
time
circumstances,
the
constitutionally
prescribed
emergency
means
of
enabling
detention
of
citizens
without
criminal
charge
shall
be
adhered
to,
or
whether
the
executive
alone
or
the
executive
with
the
approval
of
this
court
can
device
some
other
means
of
meeting
the
emergency.
the
government
justifies
the
detention
of
hamdi
on
principles
of
the
law
of
war.
it
made
the
same
claim
that
it
could
ignore
the
common
law
requirement
of
criminal
trial
with
respect
to
an
alleged
traitor
captured
during
the
civil
war.
this
court’s
reply
in
a
famous
case
called
ex
parte
milligan
was
as
follows:
if
it
was
dangerous
in
the
distracted
condition
of
affairs
to
leave
milligan
unrestrained
of
his
liberty
because
he
conspired
against
the
government,
afforded
aid
and
comfort
to
rebels
and
insighted
the
people
to
insurrection,
the
law
said
to
arrest
him,
confine
him
closely,
render
him
powerless
to
do
further
mischief,
and
then
present
his
case
to
the
grand
jury
of
the
district
with
proofs
of
his
guilt,
and
if
indicted,
try
him
according
to
the
course
of
the
common
law.
i
frankly
do
not
know
whether
in
the
current
emergency,
criminal
prosecution
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
government’s
security
needs
including
the
need
to
obtain
intelligence
through
interrogation.
it
is
far
beyond
my
competence
or
the
court’s
competence
to
determine
that,
but
it
is
not
beyond
congress’.
if
the
situation
demands
it,
the
executive
can
ask
congress
to
authorize
suspension
of
the
writ
which
can
be
made
subject
to
whatever
conditions
congress
seems
appropriate
including
even
the
procedural
novelties
invented
by
the
plurality
today.
to
be
sure,
suspension
is
limited
by
the
constitution
to
cases
of
rebellion
or
invasion,
but
whether
the
attacks
of
september
11,
2001
constitute
an
invasion
and
whether
those
attacks
still
justify
suspension
several
years
later
are
questions
for
congress
rather
than
this
court.
if
civil
rights
are
to
be
curtailed
during
war
time,
it
must
be
done
openly
and
democratically
as
the
constitution
requires
rather
than
by
silent
erosion
through
an
opinion
of
this
court.
i
will
conclude
with
an
opinion
from
the
famous
commentaries
on
the
laws
of
england
written
by
blackstone
about
11
years
before
the
american
revolution.
he
said,
"to
bereave
a
man
of
life
or
by
violence
to
confiscate
his
estate
without
accusation
or
trial
would
be
so
gross
and
notorious
an
act
of
despotism
as
must
at
once
conveye
the
alarm
of
tyranny
throughout
the
kingdom.
but
confinement
of
the
person
by
secretly
hurrying
him
off
to
jail
where
his
sufferings
are
unknown
or
forgotten
is
a
less
public,
a
less
striking,
and
therefore
a
more
dangerous
engine
of
arbitrary
government."
"to
make
imprisonment
lawful,
it
must
either
be
by
process
from
the
courts
of
judicature
or
by
warrant
from
some
legal
officer
having
authority
to
commit
to
prison
which
warrant
must
express
the
causes
of
commitment
in
order
to
be
examined
into
if
necessary
upon
a
habeas
corpus.
if
there
will
be
no
cause
expressed,
the
jailer
is
not
bound
to
detain
the
prisoner
for
the
law
judges,
in
this
respect,
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
send
a
prisoner
and
not
to
signify
with
all
the
crimes
alleged
against
him."
this
passage
was
well-known
to
the
framers.
it
was
quoted
by
hamilton
in
federal
list
no.
