justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
precedents
for
applying
the
writ
in
wartime
situations
to
enemy
combatants?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
for
a
citizen
who
turns
out
to
be
an
enemy
combatant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
precedents
do
we
look
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
the
complaint,
or
the
allegation
here,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
is
possible
that
a
u.s.
citizen
could
end
up
fighting
for
the
enemy
in
a
war
against
our
country.
that's
possible.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
when
that
individual
is
captured
then,
by
our
country,
the
question
is,
to
what
extent
does
the
habeas
statute
apply,
and
if
it
does,
are
the
proceedings
limited
in
some
way?
because
of
that
status
of
being
an
enemy
combatant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
congress
did
pass
something
called
the
authorization
for
use
of
military
force,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
affects
this
very
conflict.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
application
does
that
have
here?
it
appears
to
allow
detention
of
people
captured.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
look,
it
does
say
in
this
authorization,
the
president
is
authorized
to
use
all
necessary
and
appropriate
force
against
persons
he
determines
planned,
authorized,
committed
or
aided
the
terrorist
attacks.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
say
the
regulations
in
place
provide
for
that
battlefield
type
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
this
petitioner
have
that
type
of
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
perhaps
not,
but
we
are
here
on
habeas.
do
you
agree
that,
that
he
is
entitled
to
bring
a
habeas
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
then
we
have
to
decide
then
to
what
is
he
entitled,
and
even
that
minimal
review
by
the
military,
you
think,
is
not
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
say
he
had
that
opportunity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
to
a
neutral
decision
maker
of
some
kind,
perhaps
in
the
military?
is
that
so
extreme
that
it
should
not
be
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about
that
for
just
a
moment.
what
is
it
that
the
government
is
saying
will
be
provided?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
don't
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
have
we
ever
had
a
situation
like
this
where
presumably
this
status...
war-like
status
could
last
for
25
years,
50
years,
whatever
it
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
one
week
after
the
al
qaeda
terrorist
network
used
highjacked
commercial
airliners
to
attack
prominent
targets
in
the
united
states,
congress
passed
a
resolution
known
as
the
authorization
for
use
of
military
force,
the
acronym
is
--
i
do
not
know
how
to
pronounce
it
--
aumf.
by
its
terms,
the
aumf
authorize
the
president
to
“use
all
necessary
and
appropriate
force
against
those
nations,
organizations,
or
persons
he
determined
planned,
authorized,
commited,
or
aided
the
terrorist
attacks.”
soon
thereafter,
the
president
ordered
the
united
states
armed
forces
to
afghanistan
to
subdue
al
qaeda
and
the
quell
that
is
supporting
taliban
regime.
the
petitioner,
yaser
esam
hamdi
is
an
american
citizen
whom
the
government
has
classified
as
an
enemy
combatant
for
allegedly
taking
up
arms
with
the
taliban
during
this
conflict.
he
is
being
detained
at
a
naval
brig
in
south
carolina.
hamdi’s
father
filed
a
present
habeas
petition
on
his
behalf
alleging,
among
other
things,
that
the
government
is
holding
his
son
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
although
the
petition
did
not
elaborate
on
the
factual
circumstances
of
hamdi’s
capture
and
detention,
his
father
has
asserted
elsewhere
that
hamdi
went
to
afghanistan
to
do
relief
work
less
than
two
months
before
september
11th
and
could
not
have
received
military
training.
the
government
attached
its
response
to
the
habeas
petition
a
declaration
from
defense
department
official,
michael
mobbs.
the
mobbs'
declaration
alleges
various
details
regarding
hamdi’s
trip
to
afghanistan,
his
affiliation
there
with
a
taliban
unit
during
a
time
when
the
taliban
was
battleling
us
allies,
and
his
subsequent
surrender
of
an
assault
riffle.
the
district
court
found
that
the
mobbs'
declaration
standing
alone
did
not
support
hamdi’s
detention
and
ordered
the
government
to
turn
over
numerous
additional
materials
for
its
review.
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
stressing
that
because
it
was
undisputed
that
hamdi
was
captured
in
an
active
combat
zone,
no
factual
inquiry
or
evidentiary
hearing
allowing
him
to
be
heard
or
to
rebut
the
government’s
assertion
was
necessary
or
proper,
concluding
that
the
factual
averments
in
the
mobbs'
declaration,
if
accurate,
provided
a
sufficient
basis
upon
which
to
conclude
that
the
president
has
constitutionally
detained
hamdi,
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
the
habeas
petition
dismissed.
we
now
vacate
that
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
eight
members
of
the
court
agreed
that
judgment
must
be
vacated
or
reversed
but
we
are
divided
on
the
reasons.
the
plurality
opinion
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy,
justice
breyer,
and
myself
concludes
that
congress
in
the
aumf
resolution
has
authorized
the
detention
of
enemy
combatants
in
the
narrow
circumstances
alleged
in
this
case,
but
that
due
process
demands
that
a
united
state
citizen
held
in
the
united
states
as
an
enemy
combatant
must
be
given
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
contest
the
factual
basis
for
that
detention
before
a
neutral
decision
maker.
the
first
of
our
conclusions
that
detention
is
authorized
is
based
on
the
necessary
and
appropriate
force
language
of
the
aumf.
it
is
been
long
recognized
that
preventive
detention
for
the
duration
of
the
act
of
hostilities
on
a
traditional
battle
field
is
a
necessary
and
appropriate
incident
of
war.
at
least
as
to
enemy
combatants
of
the
sort
the
government
seeks
to
detain
in
this
case,
namely
individual
who
were
part
of
or
supporting
forces
hostile
to
the
united
states
or
coalition
partners
in
afghanistan
and
who
engaged
in
armed
conflict
against
the
united
states.
and
as
the
court
held
in
ray
huron,
the
case
of
an
american
citizen
who
acted
as
a
nazi
spy
during
world
war
ii,
there
is
no
bar
to
this
nation’s
holding
one
of
its
own
citizens
as
an
enemy
combatant.
although
he
disagrees
with
the
plurality’s
reasoning,
justice
thomas
in
a
separate
opinion
agrees
that
congress
has
authorize
such
detention.
the
second
of
our
conclusions,
that
hamdi
is
entitled
to
further
fact
finding
rejects
the
fourth
circuit’s
conclusion
that
further
process
is
unnecessary
based
on
what
it
labeled
undisputed
fact.
hamdi
was
held
entirely
incommunicado
and
denied
access
to
counsel
until
very
recently.
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
he
has
conceided
the
fact
as
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
his
seizure.
the
statement
in
his
habeas
petition
that
he
resided
in
afghanistan
when
he
was
seized
is
not
a
confession
that
he
was
part
of
or
supporting
forces
hostile
to
the
united
states
and
engaged
in
an
armed
conflict
against
the
united
states.
the
government
urges
us
to
hold
that
further
factual
exploration
is
nevertheless
unwarranted
in
light
of
the
constitutional
interest
at
stake,
and
that
so
long
as
it
puts
forth
some
evidence
supporting
its
classification
of
hamdi
as
an
enemy
combatant,
he
should
have
no
greater
chance
to
challenge
that
determination.
we
disagree
although,
we
recognize
the
legitimacy
of
some
of
the
government’s
concerns.
using
the
balancing
test
set
forth
in
mathews
versus
eldridge,
we
determine
the
process
that
is
due
in
this
circumstance
by
weighing
the
citizen’s
fundamental
liberty
interest
in
being
free
from
involuntary
confinement
against
the
way
the
government
interest
in
insuring
that
those
who
have
in
fact
fought
with
the
enemy
during
a
war
do
not
return
to
battle
against
the
united
states.
ultimately,
we
conclude
that
a
citizen
detainee
seeking
to
challenge
his
classification
as
an
enemy
combatant
must
receive
notice
of
the
factual
basis
for
his
classification
and
a
fair
opportunity
to
rebut
the
government’s
factual
assertions
before
a
neutral
decision
maker.
at
the
same
time,
enemy
combatant
proceedings
may
be
tailored
to
alleviate
their
uncommon
potential
to
burden
the
executive
at
a
time
of
ongoing
military
conflict.
aside
from
unspecified
screening
processes
in
military
interrogations
in
which
the
government
suggest
hamdi
could
have
told
his
side
of
the
story,
hamdi
has
received
no
process
to
date.
we
therefore
vacate
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
there
are
other
opinions,
two
of
which
i
believe
will
be
announced
this
morning.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
