justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dunham,
can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
preliminary
question.
we're
talking
about
way
down
the
road
now,
but
do
you
contest
any
of
the
facts
in
the
mobbs
declaration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
substantial
dispute,
and
have
you
had
an
opportunity,
on
behalf
of
the
client,
to
supplement
or
to
contradict
or
supplement
the
information
in
the
mobbs
declaration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
clement,
how
can
you
assume--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
clement,
you're
assuming
he
has
no
right
to
counsel,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
could
get
his
own
counsel,
would
he
be
entitled
to
consult
with
his
counsel
during
the
preliminary
stages
of
his
detention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
cases...
it
sounds
from
your
argument
that
the
principle
interests
that
the
government
wants
to
advance
is
the
ability
to
interrogate
the
person
for
a
sufficient
length
of
time
to
determine
whether
they
get
valuable
information
out
of
them
or
not.
and
to
deny
him
counsel
during
that
period,
because
he
may
not
be
as
willing
to
talk.
now,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
things
about
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about.
one,
have
you
considered
the
possibility
that
perhaps
a
lawyer
would
have
explained
to
this
man
that
if
you
do
give
some
information,
you
won't
have
to
stay
here
incommunicado
for
two
or
three
years?
that
might
be
a
motivation
to
talk.
that's
one
possibility.
and
the
second
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
about,
are
there
any
cases
in
the
international
field
or
the
law
anywhere,
explaining
that
the
interest
in
detaining
a
person
incommunicado
for
a
long
period
of
time
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
from
them
is
a
legitimate
justification?
i
understand
for
arresting
on
the
battlefield,
that's
perfectly
clear.
but
is
this
prolonged
detention
for
that
purpose
the
subject
of
judicial
writing
anywhere
that
you
know
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question,
i
think
it's
just
relevant.
but
do
you
think
there
is
anything
in
the
law
that
curtails
the
method
of
interrogation
that
may
be
employed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
that?
