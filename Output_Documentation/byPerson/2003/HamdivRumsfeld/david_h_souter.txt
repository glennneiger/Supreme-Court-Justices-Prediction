justice
david
h.
souter
--are
you
claiming--
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
objection
is
not
the
hearsay
rule,
your
objection
is
the
right
to
make
some
kind
of
response.
that's
your
basic
process
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
this...
i'm
sorry.
go
on.
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
i
take
it,
you
have
no
per
se
objection
to
some
form
of
military
process,
so
long
as
he
could
be
heard?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
realize
that.
but
that's
what
you're...
you're
asking
us
for
something.
and
my
suggestion
is,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
that
if
ultimately
you
were
found,
your
client
was
found
to
be
entitled
to
some
process,
it
might
be,
consistently
with
your
position,
that
military
process
with
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
response
would
satisfy
your
demand.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
would
be
a
different
approach.
i
mean,
it
might
be
not
that
the
habeas
court
has
to
hold
the
hearing
that
the
military
would
have
held,
but
that
the
habeas
court
has
to
say
to
the
military,
hold
the
hearing
or
let
him
go.
you
would
be
satisfied,
i
take
it,
if
the
habeas
court,
on
justice
breyer's
hypothesis,
said,
hold
the
hearing.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
can
accept
that,
but
what
do
you,
what
do
you
make
of
section
4001.
i
take
it
it's
the
government's
position
that
it
has
absolutely
no
application
to
the
situation.
that
it
simply
refers
to
the
normal
circumstances
of
the
criminal
law.
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
certainly
did...
may
i
just
ask
one
more
question?
i
will
concede
certainly
at
least
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
did
in
the,
in
the
early
stages
of
the
period
starting
with
september
11th.
i
will
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
did
when
it
was
passed.
it
doesn't
follow,
however,
that
it
is
adequate
for
all
time.
the
fact
is,
i
will
assume
that
on
september
12th,
without
any
authorization
from
congress
at
all,
the
president
could
have
taken
action
in
relation
to
this
individual,
i
mean,
if
he
had
been
fighting
on
a
battlefield
that
the
president
took.
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
president's
authority
to
do
that
is
indefinite
for
all
time.
and
i
guess
the
question
i
would
be
interested
in
and
your
response
to
is
this.
is
it
reasonable
to
think
that
the,
that
the
authorization
was
sufficient
at
the
time
that
it
was
passed,
but
that
at
some
point,
it
is
a
congressional
responsibility,
and
ultimately
a
constitutional
right
on
this
person's
part,
for
congress
to
assess
the
situation
and
either
pass
a
more
specific
continuing
authorization
or
at
least
to
come
up
with
the
conclusion
that
its
prior
authorization
was
good
enough.
doesn't
congress
at
some
point
have
a
responsibility
to
do
more
than
pass
that
resolution?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
are
10,000
troops
there,
but
it's
two
and
a
half
years
later.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
the,
that
the
constitutional
obligation
and
the
constitutional
demand
that
his
client
can
make
is
that
the
political
branch
take
a...
make
a
further
assessment
and
a
more
specific
one.
i'm
not
denying
that
there
is
a
lot
going
on,
but
there
has
also
been
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
come
with
an
authorization
that
the
president
relied
on
and
which
i
will
assume
he
quite
rightly
relied
on
at
the
time
it
was
passed.
but
my
question
is
a
timing
question.
is
it
not
reasonable
to
at
least
consider
whether
that
resolution
needs,
at
this
point,
to
be
supplemented
and
made
more
specific
to
authorize
what
you
are
doing?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
when
you
say
the
executive,
i
think
your
response
is
assuming
that
the
executive
has
the
power.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
executive
has
power
in
the
early
exigencies
of
an
emergency.
but
that
at
some
point
in
the
indefinite
future,
the
other
political
branch
has
got
to
act
if
that,
if
power
is
to
continue.
justice
david
h.
souter
without
any
specific
reference
to
this
situation,
without
any
specific
reference
to
keeping
american
citizens
detained
indefinitely.
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
mr.
clement,
this
section
4001
doesn't
relate
to
a
hearing,
it
relates
to
the
president's
power
to
detain,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
during
interrogation?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
is
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
i
thought,
was,
we
don't
have
to
worry
or
a
court
should
not
be
worrying
about
the
indefiniteness
of
the
time
because
it
may
well
be
that
the
president
or
congress
will
at
some
point
say
the
war
in
afghanistan
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
concern
and,
therefore,
we
don't
have
to
hold
the
hamdis.
i
think
that's
the
only
answer
that
you
have
given
so
far
to
justice
breyer's
question
and
justice
o'connor's
question.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can
imagine
it
and
i
can
also
imagine
that
the
concern
about
afghanistan
will
go
on
as
long
as
there
is
concern
about
al
qaeda,
and
there
is
no
endpoint
that
we
can
see
at
this
point
to
that.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
your
answer
boils
down
to
saying,
don't
worry
about
the
timing
question,
we'll
tell
you
when
it's
over.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
may
make
every
bit
of
sense
to
have
an
opportunity
on
the
part
of
that
individual,
before
someone
other
than
an
interrogator,
to
say,
i
am
not
the
kind
of
person
that
they
claim
i
am
on
the
basis
of
which
they
are
holding
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
alternative
is
not
give
him
some
kind
of
a
hearing
or
release
him.
justice
david
h.
souter
justice
ginsburg
and
i
have
an
opinion
that
agrees
with
part
of
the
opinion
justice
o’connor
has
delivered
for
a
plurality
of
justices,
but
disagrees
and
dissents
in
part
and
that
explains
why
we
nonetheless
join
with
the
plurality
to
make
a
majority
for
the
judgment
of
the
court.
we
agree,
as
eight
justices
agreed,
that
the
position
taken
by
the
government
is
untenable.
we
could
not
possibly
disagree
with
the
plurality
that
hamdi
is
entitled
to
representation
by
counsel
or
the
judicial
inquiry
in
any
habeas
corpus
proceeding
at
the
behest
of
americans.
an
american
citizen
may
extend
beyond
the
extremely
limited
scope
conceited
by
the
government.
justice
ginsburg
and
i
do
disagree
with
the
plurality
however
on
the
need
to
conduct
any
evidentiary
inquiry
in
this
case,
but
we
conclude
that
on
the
record
before
us
right
now,
the
government
is
detaining
hamdi
in
violation
of
the
law,
and
that
if
the
government
comes
up
with
nothing
further,
hamdi
is
entitled
to
be
released.
in
coming
to
this
conclusion,
we
do
not
even
reach
a
constitutional
claim
on
hamdi’s
behalf
or
decide
a
constitutional
issue.
for
our
view
of
the
records,
that
the
record
supports
hamdi’s
release
rest
on
a
statute
of
the
united
states,
18
united
states
code
4001(a),
known
as
the
non-detention
act.
that
statute
is
short
and
its
terms
are
uncompromising.
it
reads
that
no
citizen
shall
be
imprisoned
or
otherwise
detained
except
pursuant
to
an
active
congress.
in
other
words,
the
government
must
have
statutory
authority
before
it
may
lock
up
an
american
citizen.
in
our
judgment,
the
government
has
shown
no
statutory
authority
to
support
its
detention
of
hamdi.
in
our
opinion,
we
explained
that
the
non-detention
act
should
be
read
to
require
the
government
to
show
clear
statutory
authority.
the
burden
rests
on
the
government.
the
government’s
best
argument
for
statutory
authority
is
the
resolution
passed
by
congress
in
the
aftermath
of
the
2001
terrorist
attacks
known
as
the
force
resolution.
but
the
force
resolution
speaks
of
using
military
force
and
says
nothing
about
imprisoning
or
detaining
citizens.
although
the
government
argues
that
authority
to
use
military
force
is
authority
to
detain
enemy
combatants
including
citizens
in
accordance
with
the
customary
laws
of
war.
the
government
has
not
shown
that
it
is
acting
in
accordance
with
the
treaties
and
internationally
recognized
usages
governing
the
conduct
of
war,
and
in
fact,
the
record
raises
doubt
on
this
point,
and
of
course
the
government
does
not
even
argue
that
it
can
detain
hamdi
for
trial
on
criminal
charges
for
it
has
held
him
largely
incommunicado
for
over
two
years
without
charging
him
with
any
crime
at
all.
on
this
record,
hamdi
is
entitled
to
be
released
under
the
terms
of
the
non-detention
act.
a
majority
of
the
court
does
not
agree
on
this
disposition
however,
and
in
order
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
terms
closest
to
the
ones
we
would
order,
it
is
necessary
for
justice
ginsburg
and
me
to
join
with
the
plurality
of
the
court.
the
case
will
therefore,
be
sent
back
for
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
which
hamdi
will
have
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
proving
his
claim
that
he
is
not
an
enemy
combatant
as
the
government
says
he
is.
at
the
very
least
in
our
view,
hamdi
is
entitled
to
this
opportunity.
