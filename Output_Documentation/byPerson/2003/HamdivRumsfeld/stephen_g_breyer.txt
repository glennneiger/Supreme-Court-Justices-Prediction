justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
didn't
understand
your
basic
answer.
the
basic
question
is,
in
the
ordinary
case,
not
some
unusual
case,
but
in
the
ordinary
case,
if
they
set
up
an
ordinary
military
tribunal
according
to
article
i(6)
and
it
worked
and
so
forth,
then
isn't
that
due
process?
i
thought
justice
scalia...
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
questions,
you
said
that
wouldn't
satisfy
you,
but
my
impression
was
you
were
saying
in
the
ordinary
case,
that
would
satisfy
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
it
would
satisfy
you.
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
understand
that.
that's
the
second
half
of
my
question.
they
could
satisfy
you,
i
take
it,
in
one
of
two
ways.
a,
that
they
have
the
military
tribunal
that
they've
given
in
every
war
or
so
forth,
the
ordinary
procedure
there,
a
neutral
decision
maker
and
an
opportunity
to
present
proofs
and
arguments,
or
b,
they
don't
do
that.
now,
if
they
refuse
to
do
that,
then
what,
in
your
opinion,
should
the
habeas
court
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--wait.
you're
also...
the
words
are
necessary
and
appropriate.
and
also
the
words
in
the
constitution
are
due
process
of
law.
and
also
the
words
in
the
magna
carta
were
according
to
law.
and
whatever
form
of
words
in
any
of
those
documents
there
are,
it
seemed
to
refer
to
one
basic
idea
that's
minimum.
that
a
person
who
contests
something
of
importance
is
entitled
to
a
neutral
decision
maker
and
an
opportunity
to
present
proofs
and
arguments.
you
have
heard,
in
the
last
hour,
people
talking
about
the
military
itself
recognizing
that
basic
principle
with
tribunals
in
what
is
called
army
reg
190.8.
now,
is
there
any
reason
why,
when
a
person
says
i
am
not
a
combatant,
i
was
a
relief
worker,
i
wasn't
even
there,
i
was
sold
into
this
by
people
who
wanted
a
bounty,
is
there
any
reason
why
you
could
not
have
that
kind
of
proceeding,
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
was
given
in
the
gulf
war
on
the
battlefield
in
hundreds
of
instances,
that
was
given
in
iraq
in
hundreds
of
instances,
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
the
military
itself
has
given
over
and
over
and
over.
now,
is
there
any
reason
why
that
isn't
necessary
and
appropriate,
or
why
that
isn't
in
accordance
with
law
or
due
process
of
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wasn't
the
question
i
asked.
the
question
i
asked,
is
there
any
reason
why
the
army
itself
could
not
give
a
comparable
basic
proceeding
where
you
have
a
neutral
decision
maker,
and
a
practical,
but
fair
opportunity
to
present
proofs
and
arguments?
not
some
kind
of
thing
on
the
battlefield,
something
two
years
later,
not
some
kind
of
thing
where
you
haul
in
witnesses,
but
something
that's
practical
insofar
as
you
get
evidence
that's
reasonably
available.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
a
practical
answer.
i
don't
want
a...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
doesn't
the
court
have
some
business
intervening
at
some
point,
if
it's
the
hundred
years
war
or
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
some
point,
if
you're
holding
people
without
a
lawyer,
with
the
only
neutral
decision
maker
being
an
interrogator,
with
no
opportunity
to
present
proofs
and
evidence,
with
no
opportunity
to
hear
the
other
side,
in
your
opinion,
if
that
goes
on
and
on,
let's
say
it's
the
hundred
years
war,
is
there
no
opportunity
for
a
court,
in
your
view,
to
say
that
this
violates,
for
an
american
citizen,
the
elementary
due
process
that
the
constitution
guarantees?
