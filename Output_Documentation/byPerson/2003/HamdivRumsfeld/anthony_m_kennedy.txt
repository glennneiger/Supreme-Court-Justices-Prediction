justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
government's
right,
he
is
an
unlawful
belligerent,
i
take
it,
if
the
government's
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
still
not
clear
what
you
do
with
justice
o'connor's
question
and
it's
basically
the
quirin
case.
you
are
a
citizen
but
you
are
an
enemy
combatant
and
you
are
captured.
are
your
rights
any
different
from
that
of
a
noncitizen
in
the
same
status?
you
haven't
answered
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
you
to
distinguish
between
citizen
and
noncitizen
in
the
hypothetical
case
where
each
are
combatants
against
the
united
states
and
are
captured.
any
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
any
difference
in
your
view
and
under
your
theory
of
the
case
that
you're
presenting
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
is
the
question--
--is
what
it
means.
and
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
both
indicated
and
it
concerns
me,
too.
what
do
you
want
to
happen
at
this
hearing?
you
get
your
hearing.
are
we
supposed
to
send
a
gulfstream
over
with
10
people
who
witnessed
the
capture?
how
does
this
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
still
think
that
habeas
is
necessary
in
order
to
determine
that
that
process
has
been
afforded
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
the
regime
that
justice
souter
suggested,
it's
in
place.
you
are
entitled
to
habeas
in
order
to
ensure
that
that
has
taken
place
and
have,
have
the
article
iii
court
supervise
that,
or
would
affidavits
that
this,
from
the
government
that
this
procedure
has
been
afforded
be
satisfactory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
if
you
are
entitled
to
file
that
as
a
matter
of
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
that
amuf
is
insufficient
in
this
case
to
detain,
because
declarations
of
war
and
the
amuf
historically
have
simply
authorized
the
president
to
use
his
judgment
and
his
force
and
his
capacities
and
his
power
without
having
an
extensive
list
of
the
different
things
that
he
can
do.
and
you're
asking
for
something
quite
different,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
congress
intend
that
the
president
has
the
authority
and
the
right
to
use
whatever
powers
are
necessary
to
suppress
the
terrorists
and
to
prevent
future
attacks,
consistent
with
the
traditions
and
the
powers
of
that
office?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
the
moment,
nobody--
--i'm
trying
to
find
whether
there
is
any
literature
or
commentary
on
how
long
the
detention
is
required
before
the
intelligence
value,
the
interrogation
value
of
the
custody
serves
no
further
purpose.
can
you
give
me
any
ideas
of
the
outer
bounds
of
how
long
the
detention
would
take
in
order
to
get
the
value
from
the
interrogation
that
you
want?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
it
be
a
helpful
line
of
inquiry
for
a
district
court,
assuming
that
there
is
some
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
which
you
would
contest,
to
have
testimony
as
to
how
effective
interrogations
are
and
how
long
it
takes.
and
then
we
could
begin
to
get
some
understanding
of
this
process?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
concede
that
you
have
the
obligation
to
make
the
representation
that
you
have
just
made
to
the
habeas
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
taking
away
from
the
argument
the
impression,
and
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
you
think
there
is
a
continuing
role
for
the
courts
to
examine
the
reasonableness
of
the
period
of
detention.
