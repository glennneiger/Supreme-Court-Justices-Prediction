mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
hamdi
is
a
citizen
who
has
been
held
over
two
years
in
the
united
states
with
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
as
to
the
facts
on
which
his
detention
is
based.
mr.
hamdi
makes
two
claims.
first,
the
fourth
circuit
wrongly
prevented
hamdi
in
this
habeas
proceeding
from
being
heard
as
to
the
facts
of
the
case
on
grounds
that
allowing
him
to
be
heard
would
interfere
with
executive
power.
second,
that
the
fourth
circuit
erred
in
finding
even
on
the
one-sided
record
that's
before
this
court
that
his
detention
is
authorized
by
law.
the
historical
core
of
habeas
corpus
is
to
challenge
extrajudicial
executive
detention.
it
cannot
be
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
for
an
article
iii
court
to
perform
its
judicial
function
of
inquiry
into
long-term,
indefinite
detention
of
a
citizen
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
quoting
from
ins
v.
st.
cyr,
at
its
historical
core,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
has
served
as
a
means
of
reviewing
the
legality
of
executive
detention
and
it
is
in
that
context
that
its
protections
have
been
strongest.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
for
aliens,
yes.
and
in
quirin--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--there
are
two--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--there
are
only
two
precedents
that
i'm
aware
of,
justice
o'connor.
the
first
is
the
treatment
of
the
american
citizen
saboteur
spy
in
ex
parte
quirin,
and
the
other
is
mr.
territo,
in
in
re
territo,
which
was
a
ninth
circuit
case.
it
is
not
a
case
coming
out
of
this
court.
in
our
view,
first
off,
in
territo,
the,...
he
was
not
an
enemy
combatant.
he
was
called
a
prisoner
of
war
in
that
case,
but
in
territo,
there
was
a
full
hearing
by
the
district
judge.
territo
was
claiming
that
he
was
not
a
prisoner
of
war,
that
he
was
forced
to
serve.
that
he
was
an
american
citizen.
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
it
determined
that
he
was
not
a
voluntary
combatant.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
the
allegation
here
is
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
mr.
hamdi
is
an
enemy
combatant,
whatever
that
means.
we
don't
find
it
defined
in
any
case.
we
don't
find
it
defined
in
any
statute,
and
it
hasn't
been
defined
by
regulation
or
by
anything
that's
been
filed
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
no.
i
mean,
in
its
ordinary
sense,
your
honor,
you're
absolutely
right.
and
that's
what
we
would
take
it
to
mean.
we
would
give
it--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--well,
the
government
hasn't
claimed
in
this,
on
the
record
in
this
case,
which
is
limited
to
the
mobbs
declaration,
it
doesn't
say
anywhere
in
the
mobbs
declaration
that
mr.
hamdi
is
an
unlawful
combatant.
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
limited
the
district
court's
consideration
to
that,
to
that
affidavit,
and
said
he
could
consider
nothing
else.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
that
declaration
that
says
that
mr.
hamdi
was
an
unlawful
combatant.
and
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
point,
we
do
accord
the
words
enemy
combatant
their
ordinary
english
meaning
because
we
have
nothing
else
to
tie
ourselves
to,
and
those
words
mean
an
enemy
is...
an
enemy
is
a
member
of
a
hostile
power
or
force.
and
a
combatant
is
one
taking
part
in
combat.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that's
happened.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the...
his
status
is
the
thing
that
is
the
subject
of
the
habeas
proceeding.
i
mean,
if
you
start
from
the
premise
that
he
is
fighting
against
our
country,
that's
one
thing.
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
that
fact
is
in
dispute,
and
that
we
ought
to--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--no.
i
wouldn't
allow
every
person
captured
to
go
through
a
habeas
proceeding,
but
there
is
a
different
legal
status
of
a
u.s.
citizen
from
an
enemy
alien
captured
on
a
battlefield.
they
have
a
different
status.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
yes.
first
off,
in
quirin,
we
have
to
start
with
the
premise
that
the
quirin
proceeding
was
authorized
by
congress.
they
were
proceeding--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--not
in
the
quirin
case.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
yes.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that
difference
is
that
mr.
hamdi
is
a
citizen.
he
is
not
entitled
to
belligerent
immunity.
he
is
subject
to
prosecution
under
our
laws
if
he
was,
in
fact,
participating
in
taking
up
arms
against
our
forces.
but
that
begs
the
question.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
there
were
regimes
then
and
there
are
regimes
now,
but
they
haven't
been
used
by
the
military
here.
there
are
outstanding
military
regulations
that
provide
for
a
hearing
for
someone
captured
on
the
battlefield
to
determine
their
status
if
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
their
status.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
those
proceedings
would
go
a
long
way
towards
satisfying
the
process
part
of
our
claim,
your
honor,
but
they
don't
really
address
the
authorization
part
of
our
claim,
which
we
have
two
claims
here
really.
the
first
is
that
he
has
never
been...
had
an
opportunity
to
give,
to
assert
a
claim
of
innocence.
and
those
regulations,
if
they
had
been
followed
in
this
case,
would
certainly
have
given
him
that
opportunity.
and
then
if
he
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
which
would
be
his
right,
the
district
judge
would
have
had
a
record
of
a
hearing
like
he
does
on
a...
on
reviewing
a
state
criminal
conviction.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
your
honor,
they
did
not
provide
any
process
as
contemplated
by
their
regulations.
in
fact,
the
district
judge
offered
to
let
the
military
take
this
man
and
give
him
one
of
those
hearings.
the
very
hearings
their
own
regulations
specify.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
that's
certainly,
certainly
part
of
the
problem,
your
honor.
we
have
a
strong--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't...
my
view
is
that
it
can
never
be
an
unreasonable
demand
to
comply
with
habeas
corpus
and
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
the
military's
own
regulations
provide
a
good
guide
for
how
this
hearing
would
work.
they
allow
testimony
by
affidavit
when
it
can't,
when
it's
not
convenient
to
obtain
it
in
any
other
way.
and
we
are
living
in
an
age
where
we
have...
we
are
not
living
in
the
world
war
ii
age.
we
have
fax
machines.
we
have
phones
that
have
pictures.
you
can
get
depositions.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
lot
more
than
what
we
have
now.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't
accept
it
without
mr.
hamdi--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
fundamental
to--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
we
have,
we
have
never
authorized
detention
of
a
citizen
in
this
country
without
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
to
say,
hey,
i
am
an
innocent
person.
we
don't...
he
hasn't
even
been
able
to
say
that
yet.
he
hasn't
been
able
to
look
at
the
facts
that
have
been
alleged
against
him
and
give
any
kind
of
an
explanation
as
to
his
side
of
the
story,
which
may
well
turn
out
to
be
true
and
may
well
clear
up
some
of
the
deficiencies
in
the
mobbs
declaration.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
the
only
problem
i
would
have
with
that,
your
honor,
and
it's
a
small
one,
is
that
the
military
has
refused
to
give
this
process
to
him.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
the
military
procedure
requires
the
military
to
call
witnesses
and
allows
the
detainee
an
opportunity
to
give
his
own
side
of
the
story
and
call
his
own
witnesses.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
right
now,
habeas
is
necessary
to
even
get
him
that
process.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that
would
be
a
separate
habeas
proceeding,
your
honor,
which
might
be
filed
after
the
hearing
was
held
by
the
military,
and--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--i
believe
that
any
u.s.
citizen
has
a
right
to
file
a
habeas
corpus
petition
at
any
time
he
is
detained
by
the
government.
but
i
don't
know
that
the
article
iii
court
would
need
to
supervise
the
military
hearing
if
that's
what
he
got.
he
would
certainly
have
the
right,
when
that
hearing
was
over,
just
like
anybody
does,
to
file
a
habeas
petition
saying
that
i'm
detained
by
the
government.
and
then
the
district
judge
could
look
at
the
hearing,
if
there
was
a
hearing
by
the
military,
he
could
review
it
for
fundamental
fairness,
if
that's
what
the
detainee
decided
to
do
at
that
point.
but
it
wouldn't
be--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--i
believe
that
the
habeas
court
could
always
review
the
process
to
see
that
it
was
fair.
that's
a
habeas
court's
function.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
but
it
wouldn't
be
anything
extensive.
if
there
was
a
record
from
the
military
proceeding,
the
district
judge
would
simply--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
the
regulations,
the
military's
own
regulations
say
how
the
hearing
is
to
be
held.
the
district
judge
would
be
basically
looking
to
see
whether
those
regulations
were
complied
with.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
oh,
no,
not
the
regulation...
whether
the
proceeding
was
fair,
whether
it
complied
with
due
process.
and
that
would--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--well,
i
believe
the
district
court
has
that
power,
your
honor.
the
article
iii
court
has
that
power
in
a
habeas
proceeding.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
all
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
you
haven't
had
that
hearing.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
then
the
habeas
court
should
hold
a
hearing
that
would
be
very
similar
to
what
the
military
should
have
done.
judge
doumar
here
tried
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
military
to
have
them
hold
the
very
hearing
we're
talking
about,
using
their
own
officers
to
do
it
just
as
the
military
regulations
require
it.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that
would
be
satisfactory,
your
honor,
but
the
question
is
what
interferes
with
the
military
more,
for
the
district
judge
to
hold
a
hearing
that
the
military
has
previously
refused
to
do,
or
to
order
the
military
to
follow
their
own
rules?
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
as
i
recall,
the
answer
was
we're
not
required
to
and
we
don't
choose
to
do
so.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
no,
congress
has
not
passed
these
rules.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
the
authorization
for
use
of
military
force
does
not
have
the
word
detention
anywhere
in
it.
it
talks
about
use
of
force
and
it
is
the
equivalent,
in
our
view,
of
a
declaration
of
war.
although
it
is
not
a
formal
declaration
of
war,
it
would
have
that
same
operative
effect.
and
in
our
history,
we
have
never
had
any
substantive
rights
conveyed
to
the
commander-in-chief
by
the
mere
act
of
a
declaration
of
war.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
he
certainly
has
the
right
to
kill
them
and
if
they're
aliens--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--he
has
the
right
to
detain
alien
combatants,
no
question
about
it.
but
when
it
comes
to
u.s.
citizens,
you
don't
simply
detain
them.
you
prosecute
them,
like
they
did
with
john
walker
lindh.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
in
the
war
of
1812,
there
was
a
general
declaration
of
war
but
congress
still
passed
a
list
of
specific
things
the
president
could
do.
obviously
a
declaration
of
war
doesn't
give
the
president
the
power
to
appropriate
funds
to
fight
the
war.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
if
that
is
interpreted
to
mean
that
he
can
impose
indefinite
executive
detention
on
anybody
that
he
thinks
is
necessary
in
order
to
fulfill
that
command,
we
could
have
people
locked
up
all
over
the
country
tomorrow
without
any
due
process,
without
any
opportunity
to
be
heard,
because
we
know
that
this
war
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
going
on
worldwide
and
it's
going
on
within
our
own
borders.
congress
didn't
intend
to...
when
it
passed
this
authorization
for
use
of
military
force
to
authorize
widespread
detentions
of
people
with
no
opportunity
to
be
heard,
indefinite,
solitary
confinement
for
as
long
as
they
might
live.
congress...
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
any
such
thing.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
i
believe
they
authorize
it
consistent
with
our
laws.
i
don't
think
congress
repealed
any
laws
when
they
wrote
the
authorization
for
use
of
military
force.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
i've
only
recently
been
allowed
to
talk
to
my
client,
your
honor,
and
everything
he
has
told
me
they
tell
me
is
classified,
so
i'm
not
allowed
to
convey
it
to
the
court
this
morning.
but
the
best
i
can
say
is
in
an
overall
general
way,
there
is
a
substantial
dispute.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
no,
because
it's...
it's
while
the
matter
has
been
pending
before
this
court
and
there
is
no
way
to
go
before
the
court
at
this
point,
absent
a
remand,
in
order
to
do
that.
if
the
court
remanded,
i
would
be
able
to
do
that
provided
that
we
had
appropriate
protective
orders
in
place
so
that
i
could
convey
classified
information
to
the
court.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
your
honor,
that
is
the
way
the
statutory
habeas
proceeding
is
supposed
to
unfold.
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
we
have
a
right
to
have
a
habeas
proceeding.
they've
conceded
it
at
three
different
points
in
their
brief.
so
once
we're
before
the
court
on
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
the
question
is
what
does
that
proceeding
look
like.
and
i
suggest
it's
spelled
out
in
the
u.s.
code.
when
congress
passed
the
authorization
for
use
of
military
force,
it
did
not
say
we
suspend
habeas.
habeas
corpus
statutes
are
still
on
the
books
and
exactly
what
your
honor
is
talking
about
is
what
should
happen.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that
of
course
assumes
he's
captured
on
the
field
of
combat,
your
honor,
which
we
don't
concede.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
if
he
files
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
yes.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
the
military--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--not
necessarily
on
a
mere
claim,
your
honor.
the
military
is
required
to
take
a
long
list
of
biographical
data
from
anybody
they
capture.
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
man's
citizenship.
there
is
a
birth
certificate
in
the
record.
the
military
has
not...
they're
the
ones
that
determined
he
was
a
citizen.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
your
honor,
that
may
be
the
case
but
that
doesn't
justify
taking
away
the
habeas
corpus
right
from
a
citizen.
that
is
a
right
that
has
been
there
since
this
country
was
founded
and
it
doesn't
justify
taking
away
a
citizen's
right
because
some
sham
claim
might
be
made.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
clement
is
a
worthy
advocate
and
he
can
stand
up
here
and
make
the
unreasonable
sound
reasonable.
but
when
you
take
his
argument
at
core,
it
is,
"trust
us".
and
who
is
saying
trust
us?
the
executive
branch.
and
why
do
we
have
the
great
writ?
we
have
the
great
writ
because
we
didn't
trust
the
executive
branch
when
we
founded
this
government.
that's
why
the
government
is
saying
trust
us
is
no
excuse
for
taking
away
and
driving
a
truck
through
the
right
of
habeas
corpus
and
the
fifth
amendment
that
no
man
shall
be
deprived
of
liberty
except
upon
due
process
of
law.
we
have
a
small
problem
here.
one
citizen.
we're
not
talking
about
thousands.
one
citizen
caught
up
in
a
problem
in
afghanistan.
is
it
better
to
give
him
rights
or
is
it
better
to
start
a
new
dawn
of
saying
there
are
circumstances
where
you
can't
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
there
are
circumstances
where
you
can't
get
due
process.
i
think
not.
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
go
down
that
road.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
find
that
citizens
can
only
be
detained
by
law.
and
here
there
is
no
law.
if
there
is
any
law
at
all,
it
is
the
executive's
own
secret
definition
of
whatever
enemy
combatant
is.
and
don't
fool
yourselves
into
thinking
that
that
means
somebody
coming
off
a
battlefield
because
they've
used
it
in
chicago,
they've
used
it
in
new
york
and
they've
used
it
in
indiana.
the
congress
needs
to
act
here.
justice
souter
was
on
point
when
he
was
talking
about
the
fact
that
we're
two
years
into
this
thing
and
congress
leaves
all
the
laws
on
the
books
that
relate
to
habeas
corpus
and
how
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
supposed
to
go.
they
leave
the
4001(a)
on
the
books
that
says
no
executive
detention.
but
we
ignore
those
laws,
we
don't
enforce
them.
we
don't
require
congress
to
fill
a
gap.
congress
tomorrow
could
take
these
military
regs
and
they
could
say,
this
is
the
law,
we
authorize
the
executive
to
detain
people
and
to
give
them
hearings
the
way
the
military
says,
and
then
it
would
be
lawful.
but
congress
hasn't
done
that
and
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
that
until
congress
does
that,
these
detentions
are
not
lawful.
and
i
would
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
step
up
to
the
plate
and
say
so.
