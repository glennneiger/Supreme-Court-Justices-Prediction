mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
contend
that
the
government
categorically
lacks
the
authority
to
hold
hamdi
as
an
enemy
combatant.
but
it
has
been
well
established
and
long
established
that
the
government
has
the
authority
to
hold
both
unlawful
enemy
combatants
and
lawful
prisoners
of
war
captured
on
the
battlefield
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
returning
to
the
battle.
over
10,000
united
states
troops
remain
on
the
field
of
battle
in
afghanistan.
no
principle
of
law
or
logic
requires
the
united
states
to
release
an
individual
from
detention
so
that
he
can
rejoin
the
battle
against
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
reflects
the
sound
exercise
of
prosecutorial
and
executive
discretion.
there
are
some
individuals
who
may
be
captured
in
a
situation
where
they
did
not
have
any
particular
intelligence
value,
they
have
been
handled
in
a
way
where
there
are
no
difficult
evidentiary
questions
that
would
be
raised
in
a
criminal
prosecution
and
those
individuals
can
be
dealt
with
in
the
article
iii
system.
but
there
are
plenty
of
individuals
who
either
have
a
paramount
intelligence
value
that
putting
them
into
the
article
iii
system
immediately
and
providing
them
with
counsel
whose
first
advice
would
certainly
be
to
not
talk
to
the
government
is
a
counterproductive
way
to
proceed
in
these
cases.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
give
you
the
outer
bounds,
but
what
i
can
say
is
that
the
case
here
before
you
today
in
hamdi,
and
the
case
in
padilla,
suggests
that
the
amount
of
time
that
is
necessary
to
allow
for
interrogation
without
access
to
counsel
in
order
to
get
intelligence
is
not
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
both
these
individuals
now
have
access
to
counsel
because
the
military
intelligence
experts
who
make
these
judgments
have
made
the
judgment
that
access
to
counsel
at
this
point
does
not
interfere
with
the
intelligence
gathering
process.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
suppose
you
could.
one
thing
i
would
point
you
to,
justice
kennedy,
is
the
declaration
of
vice
admiral
jacoby,
who
is
the
director
of
the
defense
intelligence
agency.
that's
at
page
75
of
the
joint
appendix
in
the
padilla
case.
and
i
think
that...
there
obviously
are
various
ways
the
courts
could
approach
this.
a
court
in
one
proceeding
could
take
evidence
of
the
question
generally.
i
suppose
if
there
were
a
situation
in
which
there
was
a
habeas
petition
filed
and
there
was
an
initial
period
where
there
was
no
access
to
counsel,
if
a
judge
for
some
reason
thought
that
that
had
taken
too
long,
i
suppose
that
judge
could
make
an
inquiry
of
the
government,
and
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding,
they
could
make
some
kind
of
filing
explaining
to
the
judge
why
it
is
that
further
interrogation
without
counsel
is
necessary.
i
think
the
important
thing
is
twofold.
one,
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
unique
interest,
especially
in
the
course
of
this
conflict,
where
intelligence
is
at
unprecedented
value,
to
have
some
ability
with
some
detainees
to
deal
with
them
in
a
way
that
allows
us
to
get
intelligence
to
prevent
future
terrorist
attacks,
and
not
be
limited
just
to
going
after
them
retrospectively
for
past
terrorist
attacks.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
justice
souter,
but
i
would
be
quick
to
add
that
we...
i
mean,
all
4001(a)
says
is
that
an
individual
must
be
detained
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
one
needs
an
act
of
congress,
and
we
question
whether
this
really
has
anything
to
do
with
the
detention
of
enemy
combatants
by
the
military,
but
to
the
extent
an
act
of
congress
is
necessary,
as
i
think
justice
o'connor's
questions
indicated,
the
authorization
of
force
provides
more
than
ample
statutory--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
souter,
i
would
say
a
couple
of
things.
one
is
there
may
be
some
difficult
questions
down
the
road,
but
if
there
is
emphasis
that
10,000
united
states
troops
remain
on
the
battlefield
in
afghanistan--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
realize
that,
justice
souter.
let
me
say
one
other
thing.
and
then
if
i
have
time,
i'd
come
back
to
the
10,000
troops
still
on
the
ground.
what
i
would
say
is
congress
has
been
open
with
whatever
appropriate
recesses
every
day
since
september
18th,
2001
when
they
passed
the
joint
resolution.
if
they
were
to
pass
some
specific
statute
that
either
provided
for
more
finely
reticulated
procedures
for
dealing
with
enemy
combatants
or
tried
to
preclude
the
detention
of
certain
individuals,
then
i
think
one
of
two
things
would
happen,
either
the
executive
branch
would
follow
those
more
reticulated
provisions,
or
i
suppose
if
there
was
a
judgment
by
congress
that
this
authority
was
denied
all
together
and
the
president
thought
that
that
authority
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
fighting
of
the
battle
in
afghanistan,
then
you
might
have
a
situation
where
we
came
to
this
court
in
a
situation
that
justice
jackson
would
say
the
executive's
power
is
at
its
lowest
ebb.
but
here
we
come
to
the
court
with
that
authorization
that
the
president
relied
on.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again,
justice
souter,
i
can't
imagine
that
the
rule
is
that
the
executive
somehow
suffers
if
congress
doesn't
fill
the
breach.
because
the
last
word
from
congress
is
that...
that
all
necessary
and
appropriate
force
is
authorized.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
justice
souter,
they
have
authorized
the
use
of
force.
they
recognize,
if
you
took--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
would,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
that's
why
i
find
it
so
remarkable
that
we
have
to
confront
this
question
when
our
troops
are
still
on
the
ground
in
afghanistan.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
breyer,
let
me
say
several
things.
one
is
that
the
regulations
that
are
being
bandied
about
are
the
regulations
that
the
army
uses
to
comply
with
their
obligations
under
article
v
of
the
geneva
convention.
now,
article
v
of
the
geneva
convention
does
not
apply
here,
and
let
me
address
why
in
a
minute,
but
let
me
say
very
clearly
that
these
individuals
have
gotten
military
process.
it
might
not
have
been
the
exact
process--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
understand
that.
but
the
practical
answer
that
you
are
looking
for
assumes
a
process
that's
never
been
provided.
there
has
never
been
a
process
that's
removed
from
the
battlefield.
what
article
v
provides
and
what
the
military
regulations
provide
is
immediately
adjunct
to
the
battlefield,
you
have
three
military
officers
who
do
a
very
quick
hearing,
the
purpose
of
which
primarily
is
to
figure
out
not
whether
somebody
is
completely
innocent,
but
to
figure
out
whether
they
are
properly
classified
as
a
prisoner
of
war,
as
opposed
to
an
unlawful
enemy
combatant.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
do,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--this
petitioner,
justice
o'connor,
did
not
get
that
precise
type
of
review,
and
the
reason
is
because,
based
on
a
presidential
determination,
the
military
officers
understood
that
article
v
of
the
geneva
convention
has
no
application
here.
again,
that
provision,
and
i
think
it's
worth--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--we
do
agree
that
he
is
entitled
to
bring
a--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--habeas
action.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
it's
required,
especially
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
although
hamdi
did
not
receive
an
article
v
hearing
because
it
was
inapplicable,
he
did
receive
military
process.
when
he
was
originally
turned
over
to
the
united
states
forces
by
the
northern
alliance,
our
military
allies,
there
was
a
screening
process
on
the
ground
in
afghanistan.
now,
that
process
screened
out
10,000
individuals
out
of
u.s.
custody.
so
he
received
that
process.
now,
to
be
sure,
it's
a
military
process,
but
it
is
the
kind
of
process
that
prisoners
of
war
and
enemy
combatants
have
always
gotten.
now,
because
of
the
nature
of
this
war,
hamdi
got
additional
process.
and
it's
important
to
point
out
that
this
article
v
process
that
other
prisoners
of
war
traditionally
get
is
a
one-shot
deal.
it's
done
off
the
battlefield
and
that's
it.
you
are
under
detention
for
the
remainder
of
the
battle.
and
there's
no
reason
for
congress
to
have
to
go
in
with
a
new
resolution.
you
are
there
for
the
remainder
of
the
war.
now,
in
this
context,
because
we
recognize
that
there
are
some
unusual
aspects
of
this
war,
and
also
because
the
united
states
military
has
no
interest
in
detaining
any
individual
who
is
not
an
enemy
combatant
or
who
does
not
present
a
continuing
threat,
when
hamdi
got
to
guantanamo,
he
was
given
additional
screening
processes.
that
screened
him
in
as
well.
did
not
screen
him
out.
then
it
may
not
seem
what
you
think
of
as
traditional
due
process
in
an
article
iii
sense,
but
the
interrogation
process
itself
provides
an
opportunity
for
an
individual
to
explain
that
this
has
all
been
a
mistake.
and
as
the
affidavit
that's
in
the
record
here
shows--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
and
the
affidavit
that's
filed
here
represents,
by
mr.
mobbs,
that
the
interrogation
process,
in
that
process,
his
story
confirmed
that
he
was
on
the
battlefield
and
surrendered
with
the
taliban
military
unit
while
armed.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
kennedy,
i'm
not
positive
what
the
ultimate
minimum
that
the
habeas
statutes
would
require
in
this
context,
but
we
do
think
that
an
appropriate
balance
of
individual
rights,
the
traditional
role
of
habeas,
that
the
overwhelming
military
imperatives
of
this
situation
are
that
the
habeas
corpus
writ
is
available,
first
to
make
legal
challenges
to
the
detention
along
the
lines
of
4001(a)
categorically
precludes
this,
and
those
challenges
have
been
open.
we
also
think
it
appropriate
for
the
united
states
to
come
in
with
a
declaration
that
explains
the
basis
for
the
military's
decision.
and
particularly,
i
think
what
it
does
is
it
provides
an
explanation
that
if
believed,
provides
a
basis
for
a
court
to
police
the
line
that
separates
quirin
on
the
one
hand
from
milligan
on
the
other.
and
obviously,
a
situation
like
this
with
a
battlefield
detainee
who
surrendered
while
armed
on
the
battlefield
is
a
classic
case
of
an
enemy
combatant.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
mean,
there
actually
is,
i
mean,
it
would
be
something
like
double
hearsay,
but
there
is
a
statement
in
the
mobbs
declaration
itself
where
mobbs
is
summarizing
that
hamdi
himself--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
certainly
is,
but
this
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
he
has
an
opportunity
to
explain
it
in
his
own
words.
now,
it
may
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--during
interrogation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
during
interrogation.
during
the
initial
screening.
during
the
screening
in
guantanamo.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
o'connor.
and
let
me
say
two
things.
one
is
when
the
initial
screening
criteria
are
applied
in
the
field,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
that
is
a
neutral
decision
maker.
i
mean,
as
i
said
before,
the
army
is
not
interested
in
holding
people
as
enemy
combatants
that
don't
qualify
for
that
and
don't
pose
a
threat.
the
second
thing
i
would
say,
though,
is
that
as
i
understand
it,
the
plan
on
a
going-forward
basis
reflecting
the
unique
situation
of
this
battle
is
to
provide
individuals
like
hamdi,
like
padilla,
with
the
equivalent
of
the
annual
review
process
that's
laid
out
in
the
briefs--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
o'connor,
those
regulations
are
still
in
draft
form.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
don't
know
for
sure.
i
think
what's
envisioned
is
an
opportunity
to
go
before
a
neutral
tribunal,
some
opportunity
to
present--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
stevens,
what
we're
assuming
is
that
he
has
no
right
to
counsel
that
is
automatic
and
as
of
right--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--not
at
the
preliminary
stages
if
the
government
has
made
a
determination
that
access
to
counsel
would
interfere
with
the
intelligence
gathering
process.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
let
me
answer
both
parts
of
your
question,
justice
stevens.
certainly
it
has
occurred
to
us
and
we
have
considered
the
possibility
that
in
some
circumstances
with
some
individuals,
the
best
way
to
get
them
to
cooperate
and
provide
information
is
to
give
them
a
lawyer
who
will
tell
them,
boy,
you
know,
it's
in
your
best
interest
to
plead
to
this
relatively
minor
material
support
charge
or
whatever
and
provide
the
government
with
everything
that
you
have.
and
that
is
part
of
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
earlier
question,
is
why
is
it
that
there
is
this
pattern
that
you
look
at
and
some
people
are
used
in
the
article
iii
system
and
other
people
are
prosecuted
or
dealt
with
in
preventative
detention
in
the
military
system.
and
it
reflects
a
judgment
by
people
whose
job
it
is
to
make
these
judgments
that
certain
people,
the
best
way
to
get
them
to
cooperate,
or
maybe
with
certain
individuals
after
you've
gotten
a
certain
amount
of
information
from
them,
but
you
feel
there
is
one
other
area
you're
not
going
to
get
unless
the
dynamic
fundamentally
changes,
those
people
may
be
best
dealt
with
in
the
way
that
you
envisioned.
whereas
other
individuals,
the
only
way
that
the
judgment
of
the
intelligence
experts
had
to
deal
with
them
is
to
provide
them
without
counsel
and
to
use
an
interrogation.
i
think
to
your
second
point
of
the
question,
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
authorities
that
i'm
aware
of
that
address
exactly
what
you're
talking
about,
but
i
think
there
are
two
types
of
authority
that
we
would
point
to
as
being
very
important.
first
of
all,
it's
long
been
recognized
that
one
of
the
major
justifications
for
the
detention
of
enemy
combatants
or
prisoners
of
war
is
to
gather
intelligence.
and
we
cite
some
sources
to
that
effect
in
the
brief.
the
second
thing,
and
i
think
this
is
important,
is
that
it
has
never
been
the
case
that
prisoners
of
war
are
entitled
to
counsel
to
challenge
their
capture
or
their
detention.
what
has
happened
historically,
and
what
the
geneva
convention
provides,
is
that
if
one
of
those
enemy
combatants
is
charged
with
a
specific
war
crime,
then
at
that
point
they're
entitled
to
counsel.
but
if
they
are
just
being
held
in
a
preventative
detention,
then
in
that
circumstance,
they
are
not
entitled
to
counsel.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
a
couple
of
responses,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
in
the
midst
of
any
war,
the
detention
may
seem
like
it's
indefinite
because
if
you
talk
about
a
detainee
in
1942,
they're
not
going
to
know
how
long
world
war
ii
is
going
to
last.
and
their
detention
may
seem
indefinite
but
those
detentions
have
always
been
approved
under
the
law
of
war.
second,
with
respect
to
al
qaeda
and
individuals
who
are
hard
core
al
qaeda
operatives,
the
end
of
the
war
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
perceive.
but
with
respect
to
somebody
who
is
captured
on
the
battlefield
with
the
taliban,
this
war
may
eventually...
the
executive
may
make
the
judgment
or
congress
may
help
us
make
the
judgment
that
the
war
in
afghanistan
is
effectively
over.
and
individuals
who
only
really
posed
a
danger
of
rejoining
the
battle
in
afghanistan
would
be
released.
now,
there
may
be
a
few
individuals
who,
as
i
say,
are
hard
core
al
qaeda
operatives
and
they're
going
to
join
the
battle
against
the
united
states
wherever
it's
waged.
they're
just
in
afghanistan
because
that's
where
the
action
is.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
there
is,
justice
stevens.
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
just
to
give
one
example,
i
think
that
the
united
states
is
signatory
to
conventions
that
prohibit
torture
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and
the
united
states
is
going
to
honor
its
treaty
obligations.
the
other
thing
that's
worth
mentioning
of
course--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
ginsburg,
i
actually
have
the
sense
that
the
torture
victims...
you
have
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
of
course,
which
i
think
doesn't
actually
apply
to
the
united
states.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
there
would
be
any
other
basis
for
bringing
a
private
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states.
but
as
this
court
noted
in
footnote
14
of
the
eisentrager
opinion,
the
idea
that
a
treaty
is
going
to
be
enforced
through
means
other
than
a
private
cause
of
action
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
a
binding
treaty,
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
going
to
constrain
the
actions
of
the
executive
branch.
just
to
finish
up
my
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
wouldn't
want
there
to
be
any
misunderstanding
about
this.
it's
also
the
judgment
of
those
involved
in
this
process
that
the
last
thing
you
want
to
do
is
torture
somebody
or
try
to
do
something
along
those
lines.
i
mean,
if
there
were
an
artificial...
if
you
did
that,
you
might
get
information
more
quickly,
but
you
would
really
wonder
about
the
reliability
of
the
information
you
were
getting.
so
the
judgment
of
the
people
who
do
this
as
their
responsibility
is
that
the
way
you
would
get
the
best
information
from
individuals
is
that
you
interrogate
them,
you
try
to
develop
a
relationship
of
trust.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
breyer,
i
mean,
there
may
be
a
point
where,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
war...
i
mean,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
you
have
in
mind
that
they
would
intervene
on.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
justice
breyer,
the
courts
remain
open.
we
recognize
the
viability
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
there
certainly
is
a
challenge
that
can
be
brought
to
the
length
of
the
detention
at
some
point.
and
the
courts
would
be
open
to
hear
claims--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
souter,
a
couple
of
points.
one
is,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
contradiction
with
that
and
my
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question.
i
mean,
you
can
imagine
a
situation
where
the
evidence
in
the
government's
own
affidavit
shows
that
somebody
is
only
detained
with
regard
to
war
in
afghanistan.
and
then
you
can
imagine
that
that
has
been
signed,
sealed
and
delivered,
it's
over,
the
president
says
so,
congress
says
so
and
there
is
an
effort
to
continue
to
detain
that
individual.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
souter,
i
continue
to
think
that
there
may
be
a
role
for
the
courts
in
dealing
with
the
timing
question
at
some
point.
i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
wouldn't
take
that
away,
justice
kennedy.
what
i'm
saying
is
there
is
a
continuing
but
modest
role
for
the
courts.
the
habeas
courts
will
remain
open.
i
mean,
the
import
of
one
of
justice
souter's
questions
is
that
it's
already
too
long
and
if
somebody
raised
that
claim,
if
there
is
another
petition
filed,
a
direct
petition
now
that
hamdi
has
counsel
that's
filed
in
this
claim,
and
that
claim
is
raised,
we
would
be
in
court
vehemently
saying
there
is
no
role
for
the
habeas
court
there.
there
are
troops
still
on
the
ground
in
afghanistan.
it
makes
no
sense
whatsoever
to
release
an
individual
detained
as
an
enemy
combatant
in
afghanistan
while
the
troops
are
still
on
the
ground
in
afghanistan.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
but
the
alternative
is
to
provide
a
means
of
allowing
for
a
military
process
to
go
forward.
it's
not
just
the
interrogator.
it's
the
original
screening
team
on
the
ground
in
afghanistan
that,
as
i
said
before,
released
10,000
individuals
out
of
u.s.
custody.
it's
the
screening
team
in
guantanamo
and
then
it
is
this
annual
review
process
that
will
go
forward.
now
that
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
process
that
the
executive
branch
is
providing.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
quite
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
would
say
that
for
the
time
being,
everything
provided
to
date
is
more
than
sufficient.
