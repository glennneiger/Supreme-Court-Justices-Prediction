we'll
argument
first
this
morning

yaser
esam
hamdi
vs.

mr.
dunham.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
don't
think
any
proceeding,
mr.
dunham,
conducted
by
the
military
at
this
stage,
is
going
to
reveal
much
that's
factual.
how
are
you
going
to
get
people,
you
know,
if
he
was
seized
on
the
battlefield,
what
evidence
are
you
going
to
get
now
from
the,
from
those
people
who
probably
don't
even
remember
it?
if
the
military
accorded
some
process
at
that
time,
as
i
understand
they
said
they
did,
surely
that
is
more
reliable
than
anything
that
would
come
up
now
two
years
later.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
