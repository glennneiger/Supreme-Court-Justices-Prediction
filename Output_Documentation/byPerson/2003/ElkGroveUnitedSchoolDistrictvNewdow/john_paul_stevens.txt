justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
judge
didn't
tell
him
to...
to
discontinue
the
litigation,
did
he?
the
judge
has
tolerated
the
prosecution
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
could
certainly
tell
the
father,
this
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child,
discontinue
the
litigation.
he
would
have
authority
to
do
that,
at
least
to
say,
you
can't
bring
this
suit
purporting
to
represent
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
whether
he
can
maintain
the
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
standing
issue
as
to
whether
he
can
bring
this
lawsuit.
justice
stevens
but
she
never
asked
for
a
relief
along
that
line.
she...
as
i
understand
it,
the
mother
never
asked
to
tell
him
to
discontinue
the
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
think--
justice
stevens
--yeah,
but
the
judge
said
the
daughter
could
go
hear
him
argue
the
case
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
mean
repeatedly
held
or
repeatedly
said?
justice
stevens
they've
expressed
the
view
it's
just
a
ceremonial
matter.
do
you
think
that
the
pledge
has
the
same
meaning
today
as
when
it
was
enacted
with...
when
the
words,
under
god,
were
inserted
into
the
prayer,
into
the
pledge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
forget
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--forget
the,
forget
all
that
dicta
for
just
a
moment.
do
you
think
in...
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
words,
under
god,
have
the
same
meaning
today
as
when
they
were
first
inserted
in
the
pledge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it's
a
terribly
important
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
just
general
olson?
do
you
think
that
the
words,
under
god,
in
the
pledge,
and
i
think
of
things
like,
in
god
we
trust,
on
the
dollar
bill,
which
nobody
really
cares
very
much
about
anymore,
but
do
you
think
the
words,
under
god,
in
the
pledge
of
allegiance
have
the
same
meaning
today
that
they
did
to
the
country
when
the
words
were
inserted
in
the...
in
the
pledge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
why
you
would
not
take
the
same
position
with
regard
to
the
words,
in
god
we
trust,
on
the
dollar
bill?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
i
hate
to
take
your
rebuttal
time,
but
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case
has
this
sentence
in
it.
justice
stevens
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on.
if
the
religious
portion
of
the
pledge
is
not
intended
as
a
serious
affirmation
of
faith,
then
every
day
government
asks
millions
of
school
children
to
take
the
name
of
the
lord
in
vain.
would
you
comment
on
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
each
day
elementary
school
teachers
in
the
elk
grove
unified
school
district
lead
their
classes
in
a
group
recitation
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance.
respondent,
michael
a.
newdow,
is
an
atheist
whose
daughter
participates
in
that
daily
exercise.
the
text
of
the
pledge,
as
congress
amended
it
exactly
50
years
ago
today
on
flag
day
1954,
contains
the
words
"under
god".
for
that
reason,
newdow
contends
that
the
school
district
is
engaged
in
unconstitutional
religious
indoctrination
of
his
child.
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
newdow.
in
light
of
the
obvious
importance
of
that
decision,
we
granted
the
school
district’s
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
first
amendment
issue
and
preliminarily
the
question
whether
newdow
has
standing
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
the
very
purpose
of
the
national
flag
is
to
serve
as
the
symbol
of
our
country
and
of
its
proud
traditions,
of
freedom,
of
equal
opportunity,
of
religious
tolerance,
and
of
goodwill
for
other
people
who
share
our
aspirations.
the
pledge
of
allegiance
evolved
as
a
common
public
acknowledgment
of
those
ideals.
its
recitation
is
a
patriotic
exercise
that
fosters
national
unity
and
also
satisfies
a
california
statutory
requirement
that
every
public
school
begin
each
day
with
an
appropriate
patriotic
exercise.
after
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
initial
decision
invalidating
the
district’s
pledge
policy,
sandra
banning,
the
mother
of
newdow's
daughter,
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
intervene.
she
declared
that
although
she
and
newdow
share
physical
custody
of
their
daughter,
a
state
court
order,
and
actually
two
or
three
order,
granted
her
exclusive
legal
custody
of
the
child
including
the
sole
right
to
represent
the
daughter’s
legal
interest
and
make
all
decisions
about
her
education
and
welfare.
banning
further
stated
that
her
daughter
is
a
christian
who
believes
in
god
and
has
no
objection
to
reciting
the
pledge
or
to
hear
others
recite
it
or
to
its
reference
to
god.
banning
expressed
the
belief
that
her
daughter
would
be
harmed
if
the
litigation
were
permitted
to
proceed.
in
response
to
banning's
motion,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
could
no
longer
sue
on
the
child’s
behalf
as
her
best
friend
but
that
he
did
have
standing
to
sue
to
vindicate
his
own
personal
interest,
specifically
his
interest
in
inculcating
his
child
with
his
views
about
religion.
our
standing
requirement
enforces
both
constitutional
and
prudential
limits
on
the
powers
of
the
unelected
members
of
the
federal
judiciary.
our
standing
jurisprudence
contains
two
strands:
the
jurisdictional
article
three
standing
which
enforces
the
constitution’s
case
or
controversy
requirement,
and
prudential
standing
which
embodies
judicially
self-imposed
limits
on
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction.
one
of
the
principal
areas
in
which
this
court
has
exercised
judicial
restraint
is
in
the
realm
of
domestic
relations.
long
ago,
we
observed
that
the
whole
subject
of
the
domestic
relations
of
husband
and
wife,
parent
and
child,
belonged
to
the
laws
of
the
states
and
not
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
case
before
us
today
concerns
not
merely
newdow's
interest
in
educating
his
child
and
teaching
her
about
religious
matters,
but
also
that
sometimes
conflicting
interests
of
the
child’s
mother
and
of
greater
importance,
the
interest
of
a
young
child
who
finds
herself
at
the
center
of
a
highly
public
debate
involving
the
differing
views
of
her
parents,
the
validity
of
a
national
ritual,
and
the
meanign
of
our
constitution.
the
case
is
unique
because
newdow's
standing
derives
entirely
from
his
relationship
with
his
daughter
but
he
lacks
the
right
to
litigate
as
her
next
friend.
in
marked
contrast
to
our
normal
third
party
standing
cases,
the
interest
of
this
parent
and
this
child,
instead
of
being
parallel,
are
potentially
in
conflict.
for
reasons
stated
at
a
greater
length
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
having
been
deprived
under
california
law
of
the
right
to
sue
as
his
daughter’s
next
friend,
newdow
lacks
prudential
standing
to
bring
this
suit
in
federal
court.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
o’connor
has
joined
and
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined
as
to
part
1;
justice
o’connor
and
justice
thomas
also
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
each
of
the
three
concurring
opinions
concludes
that
newdow
does
have
standing
and
that
the
pledge
policy
is
constitutional.
justice
scalia
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
