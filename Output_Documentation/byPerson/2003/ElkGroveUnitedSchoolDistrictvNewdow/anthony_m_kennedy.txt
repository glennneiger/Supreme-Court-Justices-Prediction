justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
just
a
question
of
article
iii
standing
or
would
it
be
open
to
us
under
our
precedents
to
say
that
we
think
there's
article
iii
standing,
but
this
really
involves
rights
of
third
parties,
and
as
a
prudential
matter,
we
do
not
think
it's
appropriate
to
exercise
jurisdiction--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because,
as
i
understand
certainly
the
government's
brief,
and
i
think
yours,
you
don't
argue
prudential
standing,
it's
just
a
question,
an
article
iii
question.
would
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i...
i
saw
the
rooker-feldman
cite.
i
just
wonder
if
you
have
any
other
authority
for
the
fact
that
there's
a
prudential
standing
problem
here
and
then
you
cite
us
a
case
other
than
rooker
v.
feldman,
would
be
craig
and
boren
or
rescue
army
or
something?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
that
gets
us
to
article
iii,
the
father
says
that
it's
not
a
level
playing
field,
that
he
has
a
right
under
state
law
and
he
might
even
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
some
access
to
the...
to
the
child
and
to
try
to
affect
the
child's
development,
and
that
the
state
is
tilting
the
balance,
unconstitutionally
he
could
say.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
that's...
it's
just
a
question
of
standing.
does...
does...
he
has
no
standing
to
make
that
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
california
says
otherwise.
it
says
he
has
the
right
to
have
an
equal
shot
at
trying
to
influence
and
raise
this
child
and
that
this
is
his
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
says,
i
have
my
own
rights.
he
says...
i'll...
i'll
characterize
his
argument.
he's
saying,
you
may
be
right
about
that,
i
have
my
own
rights.
i
have
a
right
as
a
father
to...
to
try
to
influence
this
child--
justice
kennedy
--in...
consistent
with
her
going
to
school
and
with
her
mother
and
that's...
and
the
state
set
up
an
unfair
playing
field.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one...
one
more
question
on
standing.
am
i
correct
that
you
don't
argue
this
is
a
prudential
standing
case
and
you
don't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what's
your
best
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
state
or
the
school
district
has
the
obligation
to
excuse
from
the
classroom
a
child
whose
parents
disagree
with
the
pledge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there...
there
is
that...
that...
that
constitutional
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why...
why
is
that
if
this
is
not
a
prayer
or
not
an
exercise?
justice
kennedy
well
now,
let's...
let's
talk
first
about
standing.
you
only
give
it
two
pages
in
your
brief.
it...
it
seems
to
me
important
to
recognize
that
these
aren't
just
technical
rules
that
we
lawyers
are
interested
in,
but
that
there's
a
common
sense
component
to
it.
and
you
are
asking
the
court
to
exercise
the
extraordinary,
the
breathtaking
power
to
declare
federal
law
unconstitutional,
and
the
common
sense
of
the
matter,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
your
daughter
is...
is
the
one
that
bears
the
blame
for
this.
she's
going
to
face
the
public
outcry,
the
public
outrage,
and
we
take
the
case,
i
think,
on
the
assumption
that
even
at
her
tender
years
she
probably
doesn't
agree
with
that
and
that
her
mother
certainly
doesn't.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
insisting
on
standing
here
contradicts
that
common
sense
core
of
the
standing
rule,
which
is...
and
i'm
just
talking
about
her
standing,
i'm
not
talking
about
yours...
that
the
common
sense
core
of
the
standing
rule
is,
when
a
citizen
wants
the
courts
to
exercise
this
awful
power,
that
they
take
the
consequences,
and
you're
putting
that
on
her.
that's
the
common
sense
of
the
matter
to
me,
mr.
newdow.
justice
kennedy
maybe
so,
maybe
no,
but
the
rule
of
standing
is
that
the
person
who
brings
the
suit
has
to
affirm
that
they
have
that
stake
now
when
the
suit
is
brought,
and
she
doesn't.
justice
kennedy
that's...
that's
a
different
point
altogether,
but
if
she
has
no
standing,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
next
question
is
whether
or
not
the
rights
that
you
assert,
and
i
understand
what
they
are,
do
seem
to
undercut
her
position.
justice
kennedy
yet...
but
see,
then...
then
you're
getting
back
to
your
daughter.
it
seems
to
me
this
case
has
to
be
about
your
rights,
and
you
began
this
argument
by
talking
about
your
daughter
and
you're
talking
about
her
now.
i
think
she
has,
at
least
we'll
say,
i
have
serious
concerns
about
her
standing,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
her
position
is
irrelevant.
justice
kennedy
well,
let's...
we
have
to
be
careful
about
the
facts
here.
your...
your
daughter
is
not
required,
and
of
course,
i
have
a
serious
problem
about
your
daughter's
standing,
but
your
daughter
is
not
required
to
put
her
hand
over
her
heart
and
face
the
flag.
that's
a
misstatement.
she
is
not
required
to
do
that.
justice
kennedy
justice
o'connor
points
out
that's
the
difference
in
lee
and
weisman
and
west
virginia
board
of
education
v.
barnette.
one
is
a
prayer,
the
other
isn't.
justice
kennedy
now,
i
just...
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
once
again
you're
arguing
based
on
the
child,
and
i...
i
think
there's
a
serious
standing
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what...
is
there
any
merit
to
the
argument
that
there's
a
difference
in
a
religious
exercise
and
a
pledge...
in
the
pledge...
or
has
that
been
your
whole
point
here
that
there
is
no
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
when
it
doesn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
i
mean
this
pledge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
this
is
the
same
as
the
prayer
in
lee
v.
weisman?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
both
as
a
religious...
are
religious
exercises?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
now,
it...
it...
let's
suppose,
i
thought
the
case
turned
on
whether
this
was
a
religious
exercise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which...
which
clearly
there
was
in
lee
v.
weisman.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why...
why
is
this
a
religious
exercise,
or...
or
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let...
let's
assume
that
in
lee
v.
weisman
it
was
100
percent
prayer,
let's
just
assume
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there...
this
is
maybe
only...
you've
probably
figured
out,
5
percent
prayer
under
your...
your
view--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
your
view.
