justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he's...
he's...
may
i
ask
you
on
the
question
of
legally
protected
right
to
zero
in
on
this.
put
rooker-feldman
aside
for
a
moment,
put
next
friend
standing
aside
for
a
moment.
as
i
understand
it,
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
as
i
understand
it,
he's
saying,
look,
simply
as
the
father
of
this
child,
i
have
an
interest
which
is
in
fact
being
infringed
here.
even
though
under
state
law
the
mother
of
the
child
has
the
right
to
cast
the
final
decision
on
matters
of
morals,
education,
religion,
i
nonetheless
have
an
interest
as
a
father,
and
that
interest
is
in
seeing
that
my
child
is
not
subjected
to
what
i
believe
is
an
unconstitutional
religious
interest
or
religious
influence.
what
is
your
answer
to
his
claim
that
that
is
enough
to
give
him
personal
standing?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
mother
isn't
a
decision-maker
for
the
school
district,
neither
is
the
father
a
decision-maker.
if
there's
going
to
be
a
decision-maker,
it's
ultimately
going
to
be
a
judicial
decision-maker
on
the
constitutional
question.
he
is
simply
saying,
i
have
a
right
to
raise
that
question
by
virtue
of
my
interest
as
a
father,
even
though
at
the
present
time
under
state
law
i
cannot
control
her
presence
or
absence
at
the
school.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
aren't...
aren't
you
basically
answering
the
question
as
if
i
were
asking
you
a
next
friend
standing
question?
who
should
stand
for
the
child
in
court
as
next
friend
is
between
these
two
parents.
i'm
asking
the
question
simply
about
his
interest,
not
as
next
friend
but
as
father,
admittedly
with
limited
rights.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
this
your
argument,
mr.
olson?
in...
in
determining
whether
we
should
recognize
his
next
friend
standing,
we
should
take
into
consideration
the
state
custody
arrangements
and
the
state
judgments
about
what
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
when
we
go
to
the
second
question,
should
we
recognize
his
individual
standing,
if
we
do
recognize
his
individual
standing,
but
we
don't
recognize
his
standing
as
next
friend,
we
will
undercut
the
interests
which
are
being
protected
by
refusing
to
recognize
his
standing
as
next
friend.
we've
got
to
go,
in
effect,
we've
got
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion
in
each
case
or
we
will
undercut
our
conclusion
on...
on
next
friend
standing
if
it's
adverse.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
the
merits
here
certainly
have
nothing
to
do
with
domestic
relations.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
do
you
make
of...
of
this
argument?
i
will
assume,
and
i...
i
do
assume,
that...
that
if
you
read
the
pledge
carefully,
the...
the
reference
to
under
god
means
something
more
than
a
mere
description
of
how
somebody
else
once
thought.
we're
pledging
allegiance
to
the
flag
and
to
the
republic.
the
republic
is
then
described
as
being
under
god,
and
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
that
would...
would
be
i
think
that's
the
way
the
republic
ought
to
be
conceived,
as
under
god.
so
i
think...
i
think
there's
some
affirmation
there.
i
will
grant
you
that.
what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
that
in
actual
practice
the...
the...
the
affirmation
in
the
midst
of
this
civic
exercise
as
a
religious
affirmation
is...
is
so
tepid,
so
diluted
then
so
far,
let's
say,
from
a
compulsory
prayer
that
in
fact
it...
it
should
be,
in
effect,
beneath
the
constitutional
radar.
it's...
it's
sometimes,
you
know
the
phrase,
the
rostow
phrase,
the
ceremonial
deism.
what...
what
do
you
make
of...
of
that
argument,
even...
even
assuming
that,
as
i
do,
that
there
is
some
affirmation
involved
when
the
child
says
this
as
a
technical
matter?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
the
argument
is
not
that
the
government
is...
is
saying,
we
are
defining
this
as
inconsequential
for
you.
i
think
the
argument
is
that
simply
the
way
we
live
and
think
and
work
in
schools
and
in
civic
society
in
which
the
pledge
is
made,
that
the...
that
whatever
is
distinctively
religious
as
an
affirmation
is
simply
lost.
it...
it's
not
that
the...
that
the
government
is
saying,
you've
got
to
pretend
that
it's
lost.
the
argument
is
that
it
is
lost,
that
the
religious,
as
distinct
from
a
civic
content,
is
close
to
disappearing
here.
