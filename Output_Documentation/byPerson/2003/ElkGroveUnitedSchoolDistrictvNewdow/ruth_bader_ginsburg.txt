without
benefit
of
brief
and
oral
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your...
your
argument
is
that
there's
a
stronger
case
now
than
there
would
have
been
50
years
ago?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
not
have
it
like
oath
or
affirmation?
that
is,
give
people
a
choice,
don't
say
it's
got
to
be
all
one
way
or
all
the
other,
but
say
children
who
want
to
say
under
god
can
say
it
and
children
who
don't,
don't
have
to
say
it.
justice
ginsburg
but
they
can
be...
take
part
in
the
pledge.
justice
ginsburg
in
their
own
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sounds
pretty
much,
much
more
like
a
prayer
than
under
god,
god
bless
america.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
if
children
who
say
god
bless
mommy
and
god
bless
daddy,
they
think
they're
saying
a
prayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
two
words
sandwiched
in
the
middle
of
something
and
the
child
doesn't
have
to
say
those
words.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
child
doesn't
have
to
if
it
doesn't
want
to.
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
you
don't,
you
don't.
you...
there
is
another
custodian
of
this
child
who
makes
the
final
decision
who
doesn't
agree
with
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
what
the
ending
of
every
executive
order,
in
the
year
of
our
lord,
so
and
so?
now
that,
it
seems
to
me,
on
your
scale
would
be
more
problematic
because
it's
a
specific
lord
and
not
a
generic
god.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as...
as...
but
it
doesn't
take
away
in
the
year
of
our
lord,
which
is
what
you
would
like
to
do.
there's
an
option
here
too.
the
child
does
not
have
to
say
it
at
all,
can
say
it
except
for
the
words,
under
god,
or
can
say
the
whole
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
had
here
in
this
courtroom
and
she
stood
up
when
the
justices
entered
and
she
heard
the
words,
god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court,
wouldn't
the
injury
that
you're
complaining
about
be
exactly
the
same,
so
you
would
have
equal
standing
on
your
account
of
things
to
challenge
that
as
you
do
to
challenge
what
the
school
district
does
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
she's...
if
she's
asked
to
repeat
or
to
sing,
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
god
bless
america,
then
she
is
speaking
those
words.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
think
of
that,
god
bless
america,
as
religion?
it's
not
exactly
like
a
hymn
that
you'd
sing
in
church?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
a
clear
free
exercise
right
to
get
at
those
laws,
wouldn't
you,
that
you
recited
that
said
atheists
can't
run
for
office,
atheists
can't
do
this
or
that?
that...
that
would
be
plainly
unconstitutional,
would
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
if
anyone
challenged
that--
