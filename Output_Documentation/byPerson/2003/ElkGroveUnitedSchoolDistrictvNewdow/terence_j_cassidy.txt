mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
daily
recitation
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
flag
by
millions
of
school
children
across
our
country
does
not
violate
the
establishment
clause.
petitioners
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
incorrect
for
two
reasons.
first,
respondent
lacks
standing
to
assert
the
claims
in
this
case,
and
second,
the
school
district
policy
of
willing
students
reciting
the
pledge
with
the
words,
one
nation
under
god,
is
a
patriotic
exercise
that
is
part
of
an
unbroken
history
of
official
government
acknowledgment
of
the
role
of
religion
in
american
life.
the
issue
of
standing
in
this
case
is
one
of
first
impression
for
this
court.
respondent
seeks
to
invoke
the
aid
of
a
federal
court
to
override
the
state
family
law
court
in
an
ongoing
custody
dispute.
we
look
to
the
state
law
to
define
the
rights
of
parents
involved
in
custody
disputes.
the
state
court
custody
order
in
effect
both
at
the
time
this
matter
was
pending
before
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
as
well
as
before
this
court--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--has
limited--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--well,
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
the
ninth
circuit
made
an
incorrect
analysis
in--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--i
would
say
the
court
does
defer
at
times.
however,
the
court
has
the
right,
and
in
this
case
the
obligation,
to
reassess
the
rights
when
those
are
incorrectly
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
this--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--i
think,
justice--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--well,
i
would
say
both,
your
honor,
that
the
respondent
is
not
a
stakeholder
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii.
however,
we
would
likewise
submit
that
i
think
that
prudential
argument
was
vis-a-vis
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine.
we
have
requested
that
this
court
not
interfere
with
the
state
court
ongoing
custody
dispute
on
that
basis,
because
essentially
this
is
one
of
a
collateral
attack
of
a
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
i
don't
know
that
it...
this
case
fits
precisely
in
either
the
rooker-feldman
or
other
prudential
cases,
but
we
do
have
a
case
that
certainly
merits
that
type
of
consideration.
we
believe
this
court
should
defer
and
not
interfere
with
what
amounts
to
the
mother's
rights
and
interests
in
the
upbringing,
educational
upbringing
of
the
daughter.
second--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--well,
we
would
certainly
disagree
with
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
well,
i
think
it's...
the
best
way
to
approach
this
is
whether
respondent
has
a
legally
protected
interest,
which
he
does
not.
he
does
not
have
a
legally
protected
right.
therefore,
he
is
not
a
stakeholder
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii,
and...
and
i
would
suggest--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--i
have
to
answer
that
question,
justice
souter,
based
upon
how
the
school
district
perceives
respondent's
rights,
and
in
this
case,
the
school
district
must
look
to
only
a
single
decision-maker.
it's
the
only
way
a
school
district
can
function.
it's
the
same
way
this
court
should
approach,
we
would
suggest,
the
standing
issue.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
we
would
submit,
justice
souter,
that
the
question
is
truly
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
that's
ultimately
the
determination
made
when
we
look
to
parents'
rights
in
custody
disputes
under
state
law.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
with
limited
rights,
his
rights
become
on
a
more
abstract
level.
they
are
certainly
not
of
the
degree
that
provide
a
legally
protectable
interest
in
asserting
those
rights.
his
right
to
redress--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--the
reason,
justice
kennedy,
that
we
look
to
the
state
law
to
define
those
rights
is
that
because
when
there
are
custody
disputes,
the
court
directs
which
parent
gets
the
ultimate
decision-making
responsibility
and
authority.
in
this
case--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--we
would
submit,
justice
stevens,
that
the
state
judge
cannot
determine
an
article
iii
standing.
the
judge--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--but
when
the
respondent
bypasses
the
state
court,
the
respond...
the
record
reflects
that
respondent
and
the
mother
met
with
the
principal
and
the
kindergarten
teacher
of
the
daughter
and
respondent
wanted
to--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--but--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--but
certainly
if
he
bypasses
the
state
court
and
never
has
a
determination
made
as
to
whether
this
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
daughter,
you're
correct.
you
would
not
have
that
decision.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
well,
she
certainly
sought
dismissal
in
a...
in
a
manner
of
speaking
from
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and/or
to
intervene
to...
to
demonstrate
to
the--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
was
in
the
best
interest
of
her
daughter.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
but
likewise
in
this
court
the
judge
said
she
could
not.
so
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
to
defer
in
a
custody
dispute
like
this
to
the
state
court's
judgment
as
to
what's
ultimately
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
when...
when
we
go
back
and
look
at
the
rights
as
defined,
the
ultimate
decision-making
authority
is
with
the
mother
in
this
case,
and
the
reason
that
the
courts
adopt
that
is
consistent
with
the
california
education
code
for
school
districts,
because
under
the
california
education
code,
the
school
districts
have
to
have
only
one
decision-maker.
otherwise,
they
couldn't
function
properly
when
there
are
disagreements
with
parents
that
are
involved
in
custody
disputes.
in
referencing
that
code
section,
california
education
code
section
51100
sub
d,
in
relation
to
the
rights
of
parents
to
participate
in
the
education
of
their
children,
the
california
education
code
specifically
provides,
this
section
does
not
authorize
a
school
to
permit
participation
by
a
parent
in
the
education
of
a
child
if
it
conflicts
with
a
valid
order
for
custody
issued
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
with
that,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
i
would
like
to
take
this
opportunity
to
respond
to
several
points.
first,
under
lynch
we
know
that
acknowledgment
of
the
role
of
religion
in
american
society
is
not
exercising
religion,
nor
is
it
endorsing
religion.
second,
respondent
has
stated
his
daughter
is
being
required
to
stand
up
and
say
the
pledge.
his
daughter
is
not
required
to
stand
up
and
say
the
pledge.
it
is
the
parents'
choice,
the
parent
chooses
whether
the
child
recites
the
pledge.
in
this
case,
the
mother
has
exercised
her
legal
right
under
the
state
custody
order
and
we
have
discussed
that
previously,
but
therefore,
mr....
respondent's
recourse
is
to
object
to
the
mother's
decision,
to
seek
his
recourse
in
state
court
for
the
mother's
decision,
because
there
is
a
lack
of
a
causal
relationship
with
respect
to
his
not
having
a
legally
protectable
right
to
assert
what
he
seems
to
be
asserting
in
this
case,
that
it
is
his
daughter
who
is
affected
by
the
pledge.
third,
following
barnette,
schools
across
the
country,
including
the
elk
grove
unified
school
district,
have
developed
a
number
of
procedures
to
accommodate
students
who
wish
to
opt
out
of
the
pledge
exercise.
they
do
so
by
consulting
with
the
teachers
and
the
principals,
who
are
in
the
best
position
to
know
how
to
adopt
that
to
the
various
class
members.
in
particular,
there
may
be
several
ways
that
a
child
could
opt
out
and
exercise
the
rights
that
were
developed
post-barnette.
equally
important
to
the
opt-out
procedure
or
the
voluntary
requirement
is
the
fact
that
teachers
now
instruct
the
students
about
mutual
respect,
respect
of
other
belief
systems,
of
all
persons'
belief
systems.
third,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
issue
that
was
presented
in
this
case,
which
was
whether
the
school
district
policy
violates
the
establishment
clause.
respondent
conceded
at
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
school
district
policy
had
a
secular
purpose.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
school
district
policy
was
adopted
solely
for
religious
purpose,
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
there
was
any
religious
purpose
in
adopting
the
school
district
policy.
moreover,
the
pledge
of
allegiance
in
grammar
schools,
in
public
schools,
is
part
of
a
teaching
program,
and
that's
what
we're
here
about,
to
talk
about
the
educational
upbringing
of
a
child,
and
it
has
to
do
with
national
unity
and
citizenship
of
our
young
students.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
i
would
disagree,
because
we
feel
that
the
use
of
the
term,
one
nation
under
god,
reflects
a
political
philosophy,
and
the
political
philosophy
of
our
country,
as
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
independence,
is
one
is...
that
ours
is
one
of
a
limited
government,
and
that
is
the
philosophy
that's
now
more
enhanced,
more
reflected
in
the
1954
act.
but
back
to
our
school
district
policy,
which
is
what
is
being
challenged
in
this
case,
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix
at
page
149,
which
sets
forth
not
only
that
the
pledge
is
recited
in
grammar
school,
but
also
that
the
pledge
is
then...
also
can
be
recited
in
secondary
schools,
and
likewise,
that
policy
provides
that
school
children
are
to
look
at
all
the
different
components
of
our
history,
speeches,
historical
documents,
whether
they
be
state
constitutions,
the
declaration
of
independence,
the
bill
of
rights,
and
likewise,
that's
incorporated
into
the
history
and
social
sciences
content
standards
for
california,
specifically
at
grade
one
level.
not
only
are
the
students
learning
the
pledge
of
allegiance
and
singing
songs
such
as
my
country
'tis
of
thee,
but
likewise
they're
learning
about
the
declaration
of
independence,
so
they
are
learning
about
our
country's
nationalism
and
civic
unity
at
a
very
early
stage.
they
don't
say
the
pledge
of
allegiance
and
go
home.
likewise,
i
would
submit
that
the
pledge
of--
