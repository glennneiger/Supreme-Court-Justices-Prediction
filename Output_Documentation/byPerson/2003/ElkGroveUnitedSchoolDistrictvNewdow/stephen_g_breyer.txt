i
mean,
it's
pretty,
it's
a
pretty
broad
use
of
religion
sometimes.
i...
does
it
make
you
feel
any
better,
and
i
think
the
answer's
going
to
be
no,
but
there
is
a
case
called
seeger,
which
referred
to
the
constitution...
to
the
statute
that
used
the
word,
supreme
being,
and
it
said
that
those
words,
supreme
being,
included
a
set
of
beliefs,
sincere
beliefs,
which
in
any
ordinary
person's
life
fills
the
same
place
as
a
belief
in
god
fills
in
the
life
of
an
orthodox
religionist.
so
it's
reaching
out
to
be
inclusive,
maybe
to
include
you,
i
mean,
to...
because
many
people
who
are
not
religious
nonetheless
have
a
set
of
beliefs
which
occupy
the
same
place
that
religious
beliefs
occupy
in
the
mind
and
woman
of
a
religious...
of
a
religious
mind
in
men
and
women.
so
do
you
think
god
is
so
generic
in
this
context
that
it
could
be
that
inclusive?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
is,
then
does
your
objection
disappear?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
i'm
thinking
there
is
that
perhaps
when
you
get
that
broad
in
your
idea
of
what
is
religious,
so
it
can
encompass
a
set
of
religious-type
beliefs
in
the
minds
of
people
who
are
not
traditionally
religious,
when
you
are
that
broad
and
in
a
civic
context,
it
really
doesn't
violate
the
establishment
clause
because
it's
meant
to
include
virtually
everybody,
and
the
few
whom
it
doesn't
include
don't
have
to
take
the
pledge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
under
god
is
this
kind
of
very
comprehensive
supreme
being,
seeger-type
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we're...
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
that's
the
point
where...
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
offends
you
and
i
respect
the
fact
that
you're...
you're
right
to
be
offended.
i
understand
that.
but
the
question
is
whether
congress,
whether...
whether
the...
whether
the
government
has
the
power
to
work
that
kind
of
offense.
and
on
that,
because
you
say,
well,
it
doesn't
have
the
right.
well,
why
doesn't
it
have
the
right?
it
isn't
that
divisive
if,
in
fact,
you
have
a
very
broad
understanding
of
god.
it's
not
a
prayer,
it's
in
a
ceremonial
context,
and
it
has
a
long
history
of
being
evoked
for
civic
purposes.
of
course,
some
people
will
be
offended,
but
those
people
who
are
offended
can
in
fact
ask
the
child,
where
they
have
custody,
to
be
excused
or
not
to
say
the
words,
under
god.
so
it's
not
perfect,
it's
not
perfect,
but
it
serves
a
purpose
of
unification
at
the
price
of
offending
a
small
number
of
people
like
you.
so
tell
me
from
ground
one
why...
why
the
country
cannot
do
that?
