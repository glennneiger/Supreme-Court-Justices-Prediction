chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-1624,
the
elk
grove
unified
school
district
and
david
w.
gordon
v.
michael
a.
newdow.
mr.
cassidy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cassidy.
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
not
a
prayer
either.
that
was
saluting
the
flag.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
mr.
newdow,
we'll
hear
from
you.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
please
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
he...
we
certainly
don't
take
him
as
the
final
authority
on
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
you
say
is,
i
pledge
allegiance
to
the
flag
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
to
the
republic
for
which
it
stands.
so
that
certainly
doesn't
sound
like
anything
like
a
prayer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
isn't
general
olson's
categorization
of
the
remainder
as
descriptive,
one
nation
under
god,
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
disagree
it's
under
god,
you
can
disagree
that
it's...
has
a
liberty
and
justice
for
all,
but
that
doesn't
make
it
a
prayer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what...
mr.
newdow...
what
if,
instead
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance,
the
school
required
the
children
to
begin
their...
their
session
by
singing
god
bless
america?
would
that
make
your
case
weaker
or
stronger?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
think
weaker
or
you
don't
think
stronger?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
i...
my...
my
hypothesis
is
that
they
ask
the
children
to
stand
and
to
sing
the...
the
patriotic
song,
god
bless
america.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when...
when
you
put
it
the
way
you
just
did,
that
we
are...
the
school
district
is
making
her
an
atheist,
you're...
you're
certainly
overstating
the
case,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
indication
that
she
is
an
atheist.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
know...
do
we
know
what
the
vote
was
in
congress
apropos
of
divisiveness
to
adopt
the
under
god
phrase?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
sound
divisive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
courtroom
will
be
cleared
if
there's
any
more
clapping.
proceed,
mr.
newdow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
newdow.
mr.
cassidy,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cassidy.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1624,
elk
grove
unified
school
district
versus
newdow
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
