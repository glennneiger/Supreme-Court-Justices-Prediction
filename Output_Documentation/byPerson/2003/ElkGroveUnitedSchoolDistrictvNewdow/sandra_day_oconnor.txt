justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--counsel,
on
the
standing
issue,
normally,
i
guess,
we
defer
to
the
courts
of
appeals
in
deciding
issues
of
state
law.
now,
i
guess
the
california
supreme
court
hasn't
really
weighed
in
on
this
question
and
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
have
relied
on
some
court
of
appeals
decisions
in
making
its
decision
about
standing.
now,
normally
we
would
just
defer
to
that,
wouldn't
we,
and
move
on
to
the
merits.
is
there
some
reason
why
we
shouldn't
do
that
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
maybe
they
did,
but
is
it
not
the
case
that
we
normally
defer
to
courts
of
appeals
on
questions
of
state
law
on
issues
of
standing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
she
does
have
a
right
not
to
participate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
a
prayer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
i
suppose
reasonable
people
could
look
at
the
pledge
as
not
constituting
a
prayer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course,
we
have...
we
have
so
many
references
to
god
in
our
daily
lives
in
this
country.
we
opened
this
session
of
the
court
today--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--with
a
reference,
and
i
suppose
you
would
find
that
invalid
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
have
no
problem
with,
in
god
we
trust,
on
the
coins
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
all
right
for
her
to
have
the
coins
and
use
them
and
read
them,
but
it's...
it's
the...
the
problem
of
being
asked
to
say
the
pledge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
she
doesn't
have
to
say.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
wait
a
minute.
we
have
other
authorities
saying
that
no
child
is
required
to
say
the
pledge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
a
prayer.
