mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
has
no
right
to
bring
this
case
in
his
daughter's
name
and
no
independent,
legally
protected
right
to
challenge
in
federal
court
the
conditions
of
his
daughter's
education.
a
california
domestic
relations
court
with
specialized
expertise
and
continuing
jurisdiction
has
determined
that
the
best
interests
of
the
child
require
that
decisions
with
respect
to
the
conditions
of
the
child's
education
are
matters
that
should
be
made...
those
decisions
should
be
made
by
the
child's
mother.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
we
submit,
justice
kennedy,
that
a
fair
reading
of
what...
what
the
domestic
relations
court,
which
considered
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
focused
in
on
the
legally
protected
rights
of
the...
with
respect
to
this
child's
education.
he's
claiming
a
right,
a
legally
protected
right
to
challenge
the
conditions
in
the
public
school
with
respect
to
how
the
child
shall
be
educated.
this
record
is
relatively
clear,
not
only
with
respect
to
affidavits
from
the
child's
mother,
but
also
with
respect
to
the
decisions,
the
transcript
of
the
september
11,
2003,
decision
of
this
domestic
relations
court,
and
the
order
that
the
court
issued
on
january
9
of
this
year
with
respect
to
what
was
damaging
to
the
interests
of
the
child.
in
fact,
when
the
respondent
brought
this
case
when
he
had
joint
custody
without
consulting
with
the
mother,
the
trial
court
found
here
that
it
was
unconscionable
to
bring
this
case,
especially
when
he
knew
that
it
might
adversely
affect
the
interests
of
the
child.
we
submit
that,
under
this
court's
rulings
with
respect
to,
even
in
connection
with
the
right
of
the
father
under
stanley
v.
illinois,
that
may
be
trumped
when
there
is
a
powerful
interest
of
the
child,
a
powerful
countervailing
interest
under
stanley
v.
illinois
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we...
we
do
also,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i...
first
of
all,
there's
two.
it's
rooker-feldman
in
the
sense
that
what...
recognizing
standing
here
will
have
the
effect
of
disturbing
and
upsetting
the
effect
of
the
trial
court,
of
the
domestic
relations
court's
decision
with
respect
to
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
arkenbrandt
case
where
the
court
has
decided
that
the
federal
courts
don't
have
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
domestic,
the
so-called
domestic
relations
exception,
and
that
was
specifically
referred
to
include
divorce,
alimony,
and
custody.
so
there
are
those...
those
factors
all
come
together
with...
with
respect
to
describing
the
legally
protected
interest
of
the...
of
the
defendant...
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
matters
involving
the
child.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's...
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
souter,
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
so-called
domestic
relations
exception,
the...
and
the...
and
the
court
in
that
case
recognized
the
special
expertise
of
family
courts
with
continuing
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
sensitive
matters.
with
respect
to
that,
this
court
would
collide
with
those
concerns.
if
i
might
turn
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the...
well,
and
they
do
in
the
sense
that
they...
the...
the
matters
that
are
before
this
court
with
respect
to
the
pledge
of
allegiance
in
the
public
school
has
to
do
with
the
child's
education
and
impacts
with
respect...
and
there
is
in
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice,
affidavits
from
the
mother
expressing
her
concern
about
the
effect
on
the
child
of
being
thrust
into
the
vortex
of
this
constitutional
case.
one
decision-maker
has
to
make
decisions
with
respect
to
the
best
interests
of
the
child
and
the
collision
of
those
interests,
and
that
comes
into
play
because
the
child
is
the
one
that...
it's
interesting
that
the
respondent's
brief
are
full
of
references
to
the
interests
of
the
child,
the
alleged
coercive
effect
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance,
the
impact
on
the
child's
rights
and
so
forth,
though...
therefore,
although
the
respondent
talks
about
this
separate
independent
right
of
his
interest
when
his...
when
it
comes
to
his
brief,
the
issues
that
he's
articulating
throughout
the
brief
don't
support
that
standing.
they
support
the
standing
of
the
next
friend
on
behalf
of
the
child.
if
i
might
turn
to
the
merits,
this
court
has
repeatedly
noted
that
the
pledge
of
allegiance
is
a
ceremonial,
patriotic
exercise
that
acknowledges,
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--repeatedly
said
and
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
sense
of
seminole
tribe,
justice
stevens,
this
is
more
than
dicta.
it
is...
it
is
explanations
by
the
court
for
the
holdings
in
those...
in
those
cases
by
the
court.
indeed,
i
found,
and
this...
it's
a...
this
is
a
calculation
that's
capable
of
being
made
by
reference
to
the
cases
cited
in
the
brief,
14
separate
justices
articulating
that
there
was
a
significant
difference
between
a
purely
religious
exercise,
such
as
in
the
prayer
cases,
and
the
ceremonial
reference
in
solemn
public
occasions
of...
with
respect
to
the
pledge
of
allegiance.
fourteen
justices
of
this
court
since
the
pledge
of
allegiance
was
amended
have
indicated
that
the
pledge
of
allegiance
is
not
a
religious
exercise,
it
is
something
different
of
a
ceremonial
nature.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
they...
there
were
references
to
the
case
in...
of...
of
course
in
the
briefs
and...
and
in
connection
with
the
case,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
court
was
distinguishing,
and
the
court
repeatedly
said
that,
that
there
is
a
major
distinction
between
those
purely
religious
exercises
such
as
prayers
or
recitation
of
the
ten
commandments,
or
in
the
evolution
cases.
the
respondent
cites
nine
cases
that
he
says
support
the
proposition
that
he's
articulating.
he
left
out
a
number
of
other
cases
where
the
court
has
considered
the
issue
of
religion
in
public
schools,
but
those
very
cases,
including
the...
the
lee
v.
weisman
case
involved
a
pledge
of
allegiance
at
the
same
time
that
the
prayer
was
being
uttered.
those...
all
of
those
cases
refer
to
the
difference
in
significant
constitutional
respects.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
and
it
does.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
and
that
has
been
addressed,
of
course,
in...
throughout
the
brief.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the...
the
court
held
in
west
virginia
v.
barnette
that
persons
of
conscience
being
concerned
about
expressing
allegiance
to...
and
that
case
occurred
at
a
time
before
the
pledge
was
amended.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
was
the
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
flag,
but...
but
that's
the
same
thing
that's
happening
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
child
are
excused
from
reciting
the...
the
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
flag.
what
i'm
referring
to
in
these
other
cases,
as
i
indicated,
14
individual
justices
have
expressed
a
difference
between
prayers,
purely
religious--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
that
the,
as
this,
the
language
of
the
justices
of
this
court
have
expressed
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes
and
no,
and
i
would
like
to
answer,
explain
if
i
may.
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's
an
important
question
because
the
reference
to
under
god
in
the
pledge,
as
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
in
dicta,
what
as
a
part
of
a...
of
a
thought
process
of
coming
about
to
the
conclusion
that
it...
it
is
an
acknowledgment
of
the
religious
basis
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
who
believed
not
only
that
the
right
to
revolt,
but
that
the
right
to
vest
power
in
the
people
to
create
a
government
became...
came
as
a
result
of
religious
principles.
in
that
sense,
the
pledge
of
allegiance
is
today,
that
has
that
same
significance
to
this
country
as
it
did
in
1954
when
it
was
amended.
but
as
this
court
has
also
said,
and
that's
the
other
part
of
my
answer
to
your
question,
this
court
has
also
said
the
ceremonial
rendition
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance
in
context
repeatedly
over
the
years
has
caused...
would
cause
a
reasonable
observer
familiar...
as
this
court's
first
amendment
establishment
clause
jurisdiction
points
out...
would
cause
a
reasonable
observer
to
understand
that
that
is...
this
is
not
a
religious
invocation.
it
is
not
like
a
prayer,
it
is
not
a
supplication,
it's
not
an
invocation.
it
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
is
for
many
reasons,
for...
because
of
the
reason
that
i
just
made,
but
also
because
the
congress
revisited
this
issue
in
2002
after
the
decision
below
in
this
case.
there
are
findings
in
the
record
which
are
a
part
of
the
brief,
with
respect
to
what
the...
what
the
pledge
means,
the
context
of
the
pledge
in
its
historical
context,
in
the
connection
with
its
civic
invocation,
its
ability
to
invoke
certain
principles
that
are
indisputably
true,
which
gave
rise
to
the
institutions
which
have
given
us
freedom
over
all
this
period
of
time.
it's
in...
it
is
significant
that
the
court
in,
the
congress,
in
making
those
findings,
specifically
referred
to
the
decisions
that
i
was
referring
to
before,
which
have
been
characterized
as
dicta,
but
very
important
dicta,
because
they
explain
how
the
court
came
to
its
conclusions.
so
those
are
differences.
the
other
difference
that
should
be
made
is
that
the
challenge
here
too
is
not
directly
to
the
pledge
of
allegiance,
but
it's
to
the
invocation
or
the...
the
articulation
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance
in
the
elk
grove
school
district.
the
state
of
california
requires
those
patriotic
exercises
in
that
school
district
under
the
phrase,
patriotic
responsibilities
of
the
schools,
or
words
to
that
effect,
and
that...
and
the
school
district
itself
puts
this
in
the
category
of
a
patriotic
exercise.
and
to
go
back
to
what
this
court
has
taught
us
with
respect
to
the
establishment
clause
and
the
endorsement
prong
of
the
establishment
clause,
it's
the
entire
context.
it's
the
nation's
history,
it's
a
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
flag
and
to
the
nation
for
which
it
stands,
and
then
a
descriptive
phrase,
under
god,
indivisible,
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all.
so--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
they
don't.
they
don't
have
to
say
it.
they
don't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they
can
take
part
in
the
pledge--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--without
saying
any
words.
they
can
decide
not
to
participate
in
the
pledge
at
all,
and
i
think
that's
covered
by
the
west
virginia
v.
barnette
decision
of
this
court.
the...
the...
and
i
want
to
make
this
point
before
my
time
elapses,
is
that
the
respondent
makes
a
point
of
saying,
this
is
the
same
as
requiring
the
pledge
to
say
one
nation
under
jesus.
that
is
completely
different.
it's
not
supported
by
the
history
where
the
framers
of
our
constitution
repeatedly
referred
to
god,
lord,
the
creator,
and
there's
a
very
interesting
piece
of
history
with
respect
to
that.
when
the
virginia
bill
of
establishing
religious
freedom
was
articulated,
they...
they
used
the
phrase,
holy
author.
thomas
jefferson
in
his
autobiography,
which
was
published
in
1811,
said
there
was
a
motion
to
amend
to
refer
to
the
holy
author,
jesus
christ,
and
he
said
in
his
autobiography
that
that
was
rejected
because
the
framers
of
the
virginia
bill
of
rights,
or
act
establishing
religious
freedom,
which
is
a
precursor
to
the
establishment
clause,
was
intended
not
to
include
any
particular
sect,
but
to...
to
apply
to
jews,
hindus,
mohammedens,
and
it
even
says
the
word
infidels
in
thomas
jefferson's
explanation
for
the
background
of
that
act.
in...
in
summary,
the
state...
the
pledge
of
allegiance
is
not
what
this
court
has
said
the
establishment
clause
protects
against,
that
is
to
say,
state-sponsored
prayers,
religious
rituals
or
ceremonies,
or
the
imposition
or
the
requirement
of
teaching
or
not
teaching
a
religious
doctrine.
the
establishment
clause
does
not
prohibit
civic
and
ceremonial
acknowledgments
of
the
indisputable
historical
fact
of
the
religious
heritage
that
caused
the
framers
of
our
constitution
and
the
signers
of
the
declaration
of
independence
to
say
that
they
had
the
right
to
revolt
and
start
a
new
country,
because
although
the
king
was
infallible,
they
believe
that
god
gave
them
the
right
to
declare
their
independence
when
the
king
has
not
been
living
up
to
the
unalienable
principles
given
to
them
by
god.
