mr.
michael
a.
newdow
yes,
you
are.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
every
school
morning
in
the
elk
grove
unified
school
district's
public
schools,
government
agents,
teachers,
funded
with
tax
dollars,
have
their
students
stand
up,
including
my
daughter,
face
the
flag
of
the
united
states
of
america,
place
their
hands
over
their
hearts,
and
affirm
that
ours
is
a
nation
under
some
particular
religious
entity,
the
appreciation
of
which
is
not
accepted
by
numerous
people,
such
as
myself.
we
cannot
in
good
conscience
accept
the
idea
that
there
exists
a
deity.
i
am
an
atheist.
i
don't
believe
in
god.
and
every
school
morning
my
child
is
asked
to
stand
up,
face
that
flag,
put
her
hand
over
her
heart,
and
say
that
her
father
is
wrong.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i
would
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
palmore
v.
sidoti
says
that
we
shouldn't
look
at
the
harms
that
occur
to
people
as
a
result
of
prejudices
of
our
society.
if,
in
fact,
the
constitution
is
being
violated,
if
in...
and
there
are
consequences
from
people
trying
to
uphold
the
constitution,
that
just
happens
to
happen.
i'm
not
convinced
that
there
are
going...
going
to
be
adverse
consequences
to
my
daughter.
my
daughter's
going
to
be
able
to
walk
around
and
say
that
my
father
helped
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
correct,
but
i'm
not
bringing
this
in
her
behalf,
that
was
taken
out.
i'm
bringing
this
in
my
behalf,
and
my
child--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--they
may
well
do
that,
but
she's
a
separate
entity.
i
have
a
right
of
standing,
and
the
question
that
this
court
has
is
merely,
do
i
have
that
right.
and
my
daughter
is
told
every
morning--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--and
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
i
as
her
father
have
a
right
to
know
that
when
she
goes
into
the
public
schools
she's
not
going
to
be
told
every
morning
to
be
asked
to
stand
up,
put
her
hand
over
her
heart,
and
say
your
father
is
wrong,
which
is
what
she's
told
every
morning.
that
is
an
actual,
concrete,
discrete,
particularized,
individualized
harm
to
me,
which
gives
me
standing,
and
not
only
gives
me
standing,
demonstrates
to
this
court
how
the--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--she
has
a...
yes,
except
under
lee
v.
weisman
she's
clearly
coerced
to
participate.
if
there
was
coercion
in
lee
v.
weisman--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--well,
i'm
not
sure
this
isn't
a
prayer,
and
i'm...
i
am
sure
that
the
establishment
clause
does
not
require
prayer.
president
bush,
and
this
is
in
the
americans
united
brief,
stated
himself
that
when
we
ask
our
citizens
to
pledge
allegiance
to
one
nation
under
god,
they
are
asked
to
participate
in
an
important
american
tradition
of
humbly
seeking
the
wisdom
and
blessing--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--well,
president
bush
said
it
does
constitute
a
prayer.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
not
at
all.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
that
we
want
our...
that
the
purpose
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance
is
to
disagree
that
it's
liberty
and
justice
for
all.
i
think
the
whole
purpose
of
the
pledge
is
to
say
that,
and
this
court
has
stated
it's
an
affirmation
of
belief,
an
attitude
of
mind
when
we
pledge,
and
i
think
you
have
to
take
all
the
words.
it
says
under
god.
that's
as
purely
religious
as
you
can
get
and
i
think
it
would
be
an
amazing
child
to
suddenly
come
up
with
this
knowledge
of
the
history
of
our
society
and...
and
what
our
nation
was
founded
on.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i
don't
think
so.
if
it
was...
well,
if
it--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--i...
i
think
that
if...
if
they
stood
up
the
child
and
they
said,
stand
up,
face
the
flag,
put
your
hand
on
your
heart
and
you
say
god
bless
america,
i
think
that
would
clearly
violate
the
line
as
well,
just
as
in
god
we
trust.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
go
through
its...
its
normal
procedures
and
say,
was
this
done
for
religious
purpose?
does
it
have
religious
effects?
is
it
attempting
to
endorse
religion?
we
would
look
at
the
text--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
we're
saying
that
this--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--nation
is
under
god.
i
mean,
congress
told
us
itself
when
it
passed
the
law.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
they
think
they're
saying
god
bless,
yes,
and
when
they
say,
if
daddy
and
mommy
were
under
god,
they'd
be
also
assuming
that
there
was
a
god
there
if
they
said
that,
and
especially
if
they're
stood
up
in
the
public
schools.
if
they
did
that--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--but
the
government
is
not
allowed
to
take
a
position
on
that.
government
is
saying
there's
a
god.
certainly
the
child
doesn't
have
to
affirm
that
belief
if
there
weren't
the
coercion
that
we
see
in--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--the
issue
is
whether
or
not
government
can
put
that
idea
in
her
mind
and
interfere
with
my
right.
i
have
a
absolute
right
to
raise
my
child
as
whatever
i
see.
government
is
weighing
in
on
this
issue.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
well,
first
of
all,
i'm
not
convinced
about
her
making
the
final
decision.
i
think
it
was
shown
when
i
tried
to
get
my
child
to
attend
the
ninth
circuit
that
she
certainly
does
not
have
the
final
decision-making
power.
she
has
a
temporary
final
decision-making
power,
which
is
good
for
about
three
days
until
we
get
to
court.
but
more
importantly
is
the
issue
that
government
is
weighing
in
here.
the
mother
has
no
right
to
tell
elk
grove
unified
school
district
how
to
run
their
morning
exercises.
there
is
nothing
in
the
custody
order
that
is
affected
by
what
i
am
asking.
if,
in
fact,
this
court
grants
the
relief
that
i
suggest
and
that
we
take
out
the
words,
under
god,
or
at
least
tell
the
elk
grove
unified
school
district
they
can
no
longer
do
that,
then
nothing
in
the
custody
order
will
be
affected
in
any
way.
the
mother
can
still
advocate
to
have
god
and
she
can
do
all
the
things
she
wants.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
correct,
and
there
are--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--not...
not
under
what
the...
this
court
has
to
distinguish
in
this
case.
no
one...
when
this
court
opens,
god
save
this
honorable
court,
nobody's
asked
to
stand
up,
place
their
hand
on
their
heart
and
affirm
this
belief.
this
court
stated
in
west
virginia
v.
barnette
that
this
is
an
affirmation,
a
personal
affirmation.
senator--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--if
my
child
was
asked
to
stand
up
and
say,
in
god
we
trust,
every
morning
in
the
public
schools
led
by
her
teachers--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--i'm
saying
in
this--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--well,
first
of
all,
under
lee
v.
weisman,
she
is
coerced
in--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--and
no
child
was
required
to
be
at
the
graduation
at
lee
v.
weisman,
but
we
said
this
is
a
coercive
effect
on--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--and...
then
we're
back
to
the
idea
of
why
did
congress...
congress
told
us
why
they
stuck
this
in
their...
their...
into
the
pledge.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
she's
not
required
but
she
is
coerced.
she
is
standing
there.
she's
a
6-,
7-year-old
kid
at
the
time,
and
she--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--well,
it's...
again,
the
establishment
clause
does
not
require
a
prayer.
to
put
the
ten
commandments
on
the
wall
was
not
a
prayer
yet
this
court
said
that
violated
the
establishment
clause.
to
teach
evolution
or
not
teach
evolution
doesn't
involve
prayer,
but
that
can
violate
the
establishment
clause.
the
issue
is
is
it
religious,
and
to
say
this
is
not
religious
seems
to
me
to
be
somewhat
bizarre.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
can
look
at
the
standing
argument
and
we
can
look
at
elk
grove
unified
school
district's
brief,
in
which
eight
times
they
mention
that
this
is
the
mother
involved
with
religious
upbringing,
they
keep
talking
about
religious
upbringing,
18
times
they
spoke
about
religious
education,
religious
training,
religious
interest.
all
of
this
has
to
do
with
religion,
and
to
suggest
that
this
is
merely
historical
or
patriotic
seems
to
me
to
be
somewhat
disingenuous.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i
think--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--i
don't
think
so,
because
if
i'm
not
mistaken
with
regard
to
seeger,
seeger...
the
government
was
saying
what
seeger
thought
about
religion
and
what's
occupied
in
seeger's
mind.
here
it
is
the
government
and
there's
a
crucial
difference
between
government
speech
endorsing
religion,
which
the
establishment
clause
forbids,
and...
and
private
speech
endorsing
religion,
which
the
free
speech
and
free
exercise
clauses
protect.
and
in
that
case
we're
talking
about
protecting
that
individual's
right
for
him
to
say
in
his
view
that
this
occupies
the
same
thing
as
god.
here
we're
talking
about
government,
everybody
on
the
way
here
is
government.
it's
congress
that
stuck
the
two
words,
under
god,
into
the
pledge,
clearly
for
a
religious
purpose.
it's
the
state
of
california
that
says,
go
ahead,
use
the
pledge
of
allegiance,
which
is
now
religious.
it
is
the
city
of
elk
grove
that
says,
now
we're
going
to
demand--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--you're
referring
to
the
two
words,
under
god?
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i
don't
think
that
i
can
include
under
god
to
mean
no
god,
which
is
exactly
what
i
think.
i
deny
the
existence
of
god,
and
for
someone
to
tell
me
that
under
god
should
mean
some
broad
thing
that
even
encompasses
my
religious
beliefs
sounds
a
little,
you
know,
it
seems
like
the
government
is
imposing
what
it
wants
me
to
think
of
in
terms
of
religion,
which
it
may
not
do.
government
needs
to
stay
out
of
this
business
altogether.
and
this
court
has
always
referred
to--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--well,
i
would
note
that
this
court
in
its
bar
certificates
when
it
passes
those
out
has
in
the
year
of
the
lord,
and
actually
it
gives
an
exemption
for
people
who
find
that
offensive.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
we
ought
to
be--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--i
think
that's
a
huge
imposition
to
put
on
a
small
child.
imagine
you're
the
one
atheist
with
30
christians
there
and
you
say
to
this
child,
let's
all
stand
up,
face
the
flag,
say
we
are
one
nation
under
god
and
we're
going
to
impose
on
a
small
child
the...
this
immense
amount
of
power,
prestige,
and
financial
support--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--i
think
the
argument
i'm
trying
to
make,
and
i
may
not
be
making
it
well,
is
that
government
is
doing
this
to
my
child.
they
are
telling
her,
they're
putting
here
in
a
milieu
where
she
says,
hey,
the
government
is
saying
that
there
is
a
god
and
my
dad
says
no,
and
that's
an
injury
to
me
that
it
is--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--i'm
not--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--i'm
not
saying
either.
i'm...
i'm
saying
that
she...
that
my
right
to
inculcate
my
religious
beliefs
includes
the
right
to
know
that
government
will
not
in
the
public
schools
influence
her
one
way
in...
or
the
other.
and
government
is
coming
in
here
every
morning
to
start
off
the
morning,
say
put
your
hand
on
your
heart,
pledge
to
that
flag
and
incorporate
in
that
pledge
of
allegiance
that
there
exists
this
purely
religious
dogma
that
your
father
has
told
you
doesn't
exist,
and
government
may
not
do
that.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i
think
that
that
whole
concept
goes
completely
against
the
ideals
underlying
the
establishment
clause.
we
saw
in
minersville
v.
gobitis
and
west
virginia
v.
barnette
something
that
most
people
don't
consider
to
be
religious
at
all
to
be
of
essential
religious
value
to
those
jehovah's
witnesses
who
objected.
and
for
the
government
to
come
in
and
say,
we've
decided
for
you
this
is
inconsequential
or
unimportant
is...
is
an
arrogant
pretension,
said
james
madison.
he
said
in
his
memorial--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--and
again,
i...
i
don't
mean
to
go
back,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
view
that
you
may
choose
to
take
and
the
majority
of
americans
may
choose
to
take,
but
it
doesn't...
it's
not
the
view
i
take,
and
when
i
see
the
flag
and
i
think
of
pledging
allegiance,
i...
it's
like
i'm
getting
slapped
in
the
face
every
time,
bam,
you...
you
know,
this
is
a
nation
under
god,
your
religious
belief
system
is
wrong.
and
here,
i
want
to
be
able
to
tell
my
child
that
i
have
a
very
valid
religious
belief
system.
go
to
church
with
your
mother,
go
see
buddhists,
do
anything
you
want,
i
love
that...
the
idea
that
she's
being
exposed
to
other
things,
but
i
want
my
religious
belief
system
to
be
given
the
same
weight
as
everybody
else's.
and
the
government
comes
in
here
and
says,
no,
newdow,
your
religious
belief
system
is
wrong
and
the
mother's
is
right
and
anyone
else
who
believes
in
god
is
right,
and
this
court--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--i
don't
think
the
injury
would
be
even
close
to
the
same.
she's
not
being
asked
to
stand
up,
place
her
hand
on
her
heart,
and
say,
i
affirm
this
belief,
and
i
think
that
can
easily
distinguish
this
case
from
all
those
other
situations.
here
she
is
being
asked
to
stand
and
say
that
there
exists
a
god.
government
can't
ever
impose
that--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--again,
if
it
were
a
situation
where
we
said,
let's
only
do
nothing
else
in
this
classroom,
all
right,
we'll
say
god
bless
america
and
let's
just
say
those
words
or
something,
i
think
that
would
violate
the
constitution
as
well.
if
it's
just,
let's
sing
one
song
a
day
and
once
a
month
we
get
god
bless
america,
no,
that
would
be
certainly
fine.
we
don't
want
to
be
hostile
to
religion.
but
here
we're
not...
it's
not
a
question
of
being
hostile
to
religion.
it's...
it's
indoctrinating
children
and
congress
said
that
was
the
purpose.
this
court
is
supposed
to
give
credence
and--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--no,
and
again,
if
it
were
used
for
the
purpose
to
say
that
there
exists
a
god,
then
i
think
it
would
violate
the
constitution.
if
it's
merely
a
song
and
this
is
one
of
many
songs,
then
it
would
be
fine.
but
here
there's
nothing
else
in
the
pledge
of
allegiance,
there's
no
other
view
here.
there's
one
view
being
enunciated,
that
is
that
there
exists
a
god,
and
government
may
not
take
a
view.
this
court
has
all...
every
justice
here--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--well,
first
of
all,
for
62
years
this
pledge
did
serve
the
purpose
of
unification
and
it
did
do
it
perfectly.
it
didn't
include
some
religious
dogma
that
separated
out
some...
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
constitution
that
says
what
percentage
of
people
get
separated
out.
additionally,
again,
we
can
use
that
example
that
i
raised
before
with
one
nation
under
jesus.
that
would
also
separate
out
just
a
few
people
relatively
in
our
country.
there's
not
that
many
more.
it's
about
86
percent
to
93
percent,
somewhere
in
that
vicinity,
so
we're
separating
out
another
amount
of
people,
but
again,
the
principle
is
the
same.
we
are
separating
out
people.
we
don't
need
to.
again,
the
pledge
of
allegiance
did
absolutely
fine
and
with...
got
us
through
two
world
wars,
got
us
through
the
depression,
got
us
through
everything
without
god,
and
congress
stuck
god
in
there
for
that
particular
reason,
and
the
idea
that
it's
not
divisive
i
think
is
somewhat,
you
know,
shown
to
be
questionable
at
least
by
what
happened
in
the
result
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
the
country
went
berserk
because
people
were
so
upset
that
god
was
going
to
be
taken
out
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
in
1954?
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
it
was
apparently
unanimous.
there
was
no
objection.
there's
no
count
of
the
vote.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
it
doesn't
sound
divisive
if...
that's
only
because
no
atheist
can
get
elected
to
public
office.
the
studies
show
that
48
percent
of
the
population
cannot
get
elected.

[applause.]
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
the...
there
are
right
now
in
eight
states
in
their
constitutions
provisions
that
say
things
like
south
carolina's
constitution,
no
person
who
denies
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
shall
hold
any
office
under
this
constitution.
among
those
eight
states
there's
1328,
i
believe
the
number
of
legislators,
not
one
of
which
has
tried
to
get
that...
those
phrases
out
of
their
state
constitutions,
because
they
know,
should
they
do
that,
they'll
never
get
re-elected,
because
nobody
likes
somebody
to
stand
up
for
atheists,
and
that's
one
of
the
key
problems,
and
we
perpetuate
that
every
day
when
we
say,
okay
class,
including
newdow's
daughter,
stand
up,
put
your
hand
on
your
heart
and
pledge,
affirm
that
we
are
a
nation
under
god.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
that
would
be,
yes.
those
clauses
are
clearly
nullities
at
this
time
in
view
of
torcaso
v.
watkins.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
however,
they
still
exist.
and
the
fact
that
those
clauses,
i
mean,
we
saw
what
happened
to
the...
to...
when
the
confederate
flag
was
over
the
statehouse
in
south
carolina,
they
had
a
big,
you
know,
everyone
got,
you
know,
very
upset
and
said,
let's
get
that
out.
that
was
a
flag
that
can
mean
anything
to
anyone.
could
we
imagine
a
clause
in
the
south
carolina
constitution
that
said
no
african-american
shall
hold
any
office
under
this
constitution,
no
jew
shall
hold
any
office
under
this
constitution?
that
would
be
there
for
two
seconds
maybe.
but
no
atheists?
hey,
let
it
stick
around,
it's
been
there,
in
eight
states
right
now
today
in
2004.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i
would
merely
note
that
99
out
of
99
senators
stopped
what
they
were
doing
and
went
out
on
the
front
steps
of
the
capitol
to
say
that
they
want
under
god
there.
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
a
press
conference
with
vladimir
putin
decided
the
first
thing
he's
going
to
talk
about
was
this
decision.
it
was
on
the
front
page
of
every
newspaper.
this
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
major
cases
of
this
court's
terms.
i
think
clearly
it
has
enormous
significance
to
the
american
public
and
that's
why
this
is
important.
that's
why
this
case
is
so
critical.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i...
i
think
this
court
can
easily
distinguish
that
situation
from
here,
where
we're
asking
children
to
stand
up,
being
coerced
in
the
setting,
hold
your
hand
over
your
heart
and
pledge
your
own
personal
affirmation
to
some
religious
entity.
government
is
not
even
supposed
to
be
anywhere
near
this
question.
government's
supposed
to
stay
out
of
the
religion
business,
and
here
it
came
into
it,
it
was
completely
unnecessary,
and
congress
said
in
1954,
in
house
report
1693,
the
inclusion
of
god
in
the
pledge,
therefore...
and
they
didn't
use
the
phrase,
under
god,
they
said
the
entity
god...
the
inclusion
of
god
in
the
pledge,
therefore,
would
further
acknowledge
the
dependence
of
our
people
and
our
government
upon
the
moral
directions
of
the
creator
and
we'll
note
it
wasn't
a
creator,
it
was
the
creator,
the
christian
creator
and
we
know
that
because
when
they
put
the
flag
up
the
flagpole,
they
played
onward
christian
soldiers
marching
as
to
war.
i
mean,
this
is...
clearly
we
know
what
was
going
on
here.
it
was
to
get
religion
in
our
government,
and
the
outcry
that
came
when
the
ninth
circuit
issued
its
opinion
shows
that
people
still
want
their
religious
beliefs
in
our
government.
and
the
free
exercise
clause
is
fine,
they
can
do
anything
they
want
in
the
public
schools,
they
can
go
into
class,
they
can
do
whatever
they
want,
but
the
free
exercise
clause
has
never
meant
that
a
majority
may
use
the
machinery
of
the
state
to
practice
its
beliefs,
and
that's
precisely
what
we
have
in
this
situation.
again,
i
would
point
out
that
this
court,
every
member
of
this
court
has
demanded
neutrality.
seven
members
of
this
court,
six
sitting
today,
have
said
that
we
need...
that
have
authored
their
own
opinions
that
say
that
we
need
neutrality,
and
here
we
have
the
quintessential
religious
question,
does
there
exist
a
god?
and
government
has
come
in,
yes,
there
exists
a
god.
that
is
not
neutrality
by
any
means.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i
think
there
is
a
difference
when
the
pledge
doesn't
have
religious
dogma
as
part
of
the
religious--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--when
it
doesn't
have
a
religious
creed
or
religious
doctrine
inserted.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
this...
this
pledge--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--no,
not
at
all.
i'm
saying
it's
a
religious
exercise,
and
clearly
the
whole
idea,
the
intent
of
congress
was--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--well,
i
think
religious
exercise
is
a
larger
set,
prayer
is
a
subset.
i
would
say
again
the
president
of
the
united
states
considers
the
pledge
in
that
subset.
whether
or
not
you
do
or
i
do
is...
is
somewhat,
i
think
irrelevant,
because
the
question--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--correct.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
i
think
it
definitely
is,
and
it
is
because
the
two
words
are,
under
god,
and
i
can't
see
of
anything
that's
not
religious
under
god,
and
again,
i
would
point
out
in
the
standing
argument
made
by
the
elk
grove
unified
school
district,
they
repeatedly
reference
the
fact
it's
the
whole
issue
here
with
the
mother
is
because
she
directs
the,
quote,
religious
upbringing.
there
wasn't
anything
about--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--okay.
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
a.
newdow
--that...
that's
one
of
the
issues
that...
that
gets
confusing.
the
question
is,
when
you
look
at
what
it...
the
religious
part,
and
then
the
question
is,
what
are
you
going
to
define
that
as
being
encompassed
in?
in
lee
v.
weisman,
it
was
the
prayer
within
the
context
of
the
graduation
and
i
think
it
was
like
an
hour
and
a
half
for
the
graduation
and
two
minutes
for
the
prayer.
so
here
we
have,
i
think,
if
you
actually
multiply
and
look
at
the
ratio,
the
ratio
of
the
two
words,
under
god,
to
the
pledge
of
allegiance
is
greater
than
the
ratio
of
the
time
spent
on
prayer
versus
the
graduation
exercise
in
lee
v.
weisman.
you
can
do
that
with
anything.
we
have
allegheny
county
showing,
you
know,
we...
if
you
talk
about
the
staircase
and
just
being,
you
know,
this
individual
thing,
we
could
say,
well,
the
staircase
is
this...
this
transportation
mode
just
like
here
the
pledge
is
this
patriotic
mode.
but
the
question
is,
why
did
you
stick
the
creche
in
the
middle
of
this
grand
staircase?
the
question
is
here,
why
did
you
stick
these
two
purely
religious
words,
under
god,
in
the
middle
of
the
pledge
of
allegiance?
so
i
would
say
that
it's
clear
here
there
is
a
purely
religious
purpose,
we
have
purely
religious
effects,
it
fails
the
endorsement
test,
it
fails
the
outsider
test.
imagine
you're
this
one
child
with
a
class
full
of
theists
and
you...
you're...
you
have
this
idea
that
you
want
to
perhaps
at
least
consider
and
you
have
everyone
imposing
their
view
on
you,
it
fails
every
test
this
court
has
ever
come
up
with,
and
there's
a
principle
here
and
i'm
hoping
the
court
will
uphold
this
principle
so
that
we
can
finally
go
back
and
have
every
american
want
to
stand
up,
face
the
flag,
place
their
hand
over
their
heart
and
pledge
to
one
nation,
indivisible,
not
divided
by
religion,
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all.
