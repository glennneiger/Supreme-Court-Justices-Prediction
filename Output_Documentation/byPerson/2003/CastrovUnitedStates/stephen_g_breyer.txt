justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
any
case,
your
view
is
no
matter
how
absurd,
if
a...
the
court
of
appeals
says
a
60(b)
motion
is
second
or
successive,
if
they
say
a
complaint
in
a
1983
action
is
a
second
or
successive
habeas
petition,
no
matter
how
absurd,
once
the
court
of
appeals
says
this
is
a
second
or
successive
application,
nobody
has
any
right
to
appeal
here,
even
though
that
isn't
what
the
statute
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why
would
we...
why
would
we
interpret
a
statute
that
doesn't
say
that
to...
what
it
says
is,
it
says
that
they
shall
not
file
a
second
or
successive
application,
in
other
words,
if
it
is
a
second
or
successive
application.
it
doesn't
say
if
it
isn't.
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
to
do
if
it
isn't.
so
why
would
we
adopt
this
interpretation
that
you
say
where
the
statute
doesn't
say
it,
which
would
perhaps
deprive
people
of
all
kinds
of
right
to
petition
the
supreme
court
in
cases
where
they
might
be
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sometimes
there
might
be
a
constitutional
question.
i
mean,
where
for
example
an
opinion
appealed
to
this
court
might
be
required
as
a
matter
of
due
process
and
what
the
lower
court
does,
the
court
of
appeals...
it...
it
erroneously
characterizes
that
effort
to
come
to
the...
that
effort
to
appeal,
which
the
constitution
would
protect.
it
erroneously
characterizes
it
as
a
second
or
successive
petition,
and
in
your
view
congress
would
have
just
said,
even
however
erroneous
it
is,
it
can't
come
here.
what
do
we
do
about
the
constitutional
requirement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
one
final
thing.
you
realize
the
language,
of
course,
says
that
you
cannot
ask
for
cert
from
the
denial
of
an
authorization
by
a
court
of
appeals
to
file
a
second
or
successive
application.
and
your
opponents
are
saying
we're
not
appealing
the
denial
of
the
request
to
file
a
second
or
successive
application.
we
are
appealing
the
determination
that
this
is
a
second
or
successive
application,
a
matter
that
the
statute
is
silent
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
do
you
think
on
that...
that...
you're
now
answering
justice
o'connor's
question
which
is
just
what
i
was
interested
in.
on
page
42
of
your
brief,
you
basically
say
that
on
the
substantive
rule
here,
you
agree
with
the
other
side.
i
mean,
pretty
much.
and
that's
what
all
the
circuits
have
done.
and
then
you
impose
a
couple
of
procedural
obstacles.
well,
assume
you
don't
win
your
procedural
obstacles.
all
right.
suppose
i
find
and
the
court
finds
that
this
is
appealable,
and
suppose
this
law
of
the
case
thing
is...
you
say...
why
shouldn't
he
have
the
advantage
of
the
rule,
this
particular
person,
the
rule
that
we're
about
to
announce?
now,
at
that
point,
i
want
to
know
what
rule
are
we
about
to
announce
under
what
power.
and
here
i'd
like
your
opinion
on
two
approaches
which
are
different.
one
is
we
announce
a
rule
on
our
supervisory
authority,
as
most
of
the
courts
have
done,
and
then
we
have
two
difficulties.
one,
we're
in
an
area
we
know
not
what.
you
know,
we're
not
involved
in
recharacterization
as
a
daily
basis.
and
moreover,
we're
not
sure
what
rule
to
pick
or
what
exact
formulation,
which
will
make
a
huge
difference.
now,
the
other
approach
is
the
first
circuit's
approach,
which
is
not
the
reason
it
commends
itself
to
me,
but
i
just
put
it
out
there.
and
that
is
to
say
we
interpret
the
words,
second
or
successive
petition,
in
aedpa
not
to
include
this.
you
see,
what
they
were
talking
about
in
congress
was
not
this.
they
didn't
think
a
second
or
successive
petition
was
second
or
successive
where
the
first
one
took
place
under
these
no-warning
circumstances
before
aedpa
was
even
enacted.
now,
i
think
they
come
to
exactly
the
same
place,
but
that
second
approach,
which
they
followed,
doesn't
get
us
into
the
business
of
writing
rules
in
some
kind
of
supervisory
capacity
in
the
dark.
now...
but
i
want
the
sg's
view,
i.e.,
your
view,
on
the
comparative
merits
of
those
two
ways
of
getting
to
the
same
place.
and
i'm
really
uncertain.
i...
i'd
be
very
interested
in
what
you
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
think
you're
missing...
say...
say
the
same
content.
let's
have
equivalent
content
to
the
rule.
is
it
better
for
us
to...
to
say
we're
reading
aedpa
or
is
it
better
for
us
to
say
we
are...
which
is
open
to
the...
this
kind
of
reading.
we
have
to
decide
the
scope
of
those
words
in
the...
in
the
block
of
aedpa.
or
is
it
better
for
us
to
try
to
write
a
rule?
that...
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
i
can
work
out
the
rest
of
the
content,
and
actually
the
first
circuit
approach
needn't
have
a
content.
i
mean,
it
can
really
have
quite
a
minimal
content,
but...
but
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
being
clear
to
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sure
that's
right,
but
you...
you
think
we
should
go
into
the
rule-writing
business,
say,
in
our
supervisory
capacity.
these...
these
rules...
this
kind...
this
is
the
consequence
that
attaches
to
recharacterization.
a
recharacterization
is
not
a
recharacterization
that
fits
within
aedpa
unless
he
gets
notice,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
that's
what
you
think
we
ought
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we...
i
know
you
don't
really,
but
i
mean,
if
we
get
to
that
point
and
we've...
we
reject
your
other
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
a
little
complicated,
habeas
case.
the
federal
prisoner,
when
the
prisoner
filed
a
2255
motion
commonly
known
as
a
habeas
corpus
motion,
he
might
find
himself
without
a
habeas
corpus
remedy
for
a
rather
special
reason.
imagine
that
before
filing
this
motion,
at
some
earlier
time,
he
filed
a
different
motion
that
he
used
the
wrong
name
for.
he
called
it
a
rule
33
motion,
but
it
should
have
been
called
a
2255
motion.
now,
imagine
that
the
judge
in
that
first
hearing
noticing
that
the
litigant
did
not
have
a
lawyer,
he
was
preceding
pro
se,
said
i
will
re-characterize
that
motion
for
you.
i
will
call
it
a
2255
motion,
i.e.
a
habeas
motion.
and
imagine
that
the
judge
did
that
because
he
really
thought
that
2255
more
aptly
suited
the
nature
of
the
litigant’s
claim.
and
the
litigant,
not
being
a
lawyer,
did
not
say
anything.
now,
we
are
at
our
proceeding
where
he
files
his
2255
motion,
but
the
government
will
claim
you
already
did
that,
this
is
your
second
habeas
motion.
since
it
is
your
second
habeas
motion,
you
have
to
meet
special
very
rigorous
requirements
that
apply
to
a
second
but
not
a
first
one.
and
therefore
this
second
one,
says
the
government,
will
be
dismissed.
the
prisoner
says
“oh
my
goodness,
if
only
i
had
known
at
that
earlier
time
what
was
going
to
happen
to
me
if
i
allowed
the
judge
to
call
this
first
motion
the
2255
motion,
i
never
would
have
done
it
or
maybe
i
would
have
withdrawn
it,
but
i
would
have
done
something
anyway
because
i
would
have
wanted
to
keep
my
chance
to
file
a
habeas
motion
later.”
well,
that
is
what
this
case
is
about,
and
we
are
asked
whether
a
judge
should
at
least
warn
the
pro
se
litigant,
that
first
judge,
about
the
potential
consequences
of
what
would
happen
if
he
re-characterized
the
motion
and
what
would
happen
if
he
does
not
re-characterized
the
motion.
now
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
first,
contrary
to
what
the
government
argued,
that
we
do
have
jurisdiction
at
leads
to
consider
this
question.
true,
the
habeas
statute
bars
us
from
considering
a
lower
court’s
decision
to
grant
or
deny
a
litigant’s
request
to
file
any
2255
motion
after
the
first,
but
in
this
case
the
litigant
never
asked
for
or
denied
permission.
he
is
just
talking
about
whether
that
first
motion
was
his
first
or
second,
and
we
can
answer
the
question.
now
what
we
go
on
to
hold
on
the
question
in
exercising
our
supervisory
powers
that
the
lower
court’s
power,
that
first
judge,
his
power
to
re-characterize
a
motion
as
the
first
2255,
i.e.
as
a
first
habeas,
that
power
is
limited.
now
how
is
it
limited?
well,
the
limitation
applies
when
a
court
re-characterizes
a
pro
se
litigant’s
motion
as
a
first
2255
motion.
in
other
words,
the
judge
is
saying
“what
you
filed
as
a
33,
is
not
a
3,
it
is
a
2255.”
that
is
our
situation.
now
in
those
circumstances,
the
district
court
has
to
notify
the
pro
se
litigant
that
it
is
going
to
do
this.
that
it
is
going
to
re-characterize
the
pleading,
and
he
has
to
warn
the
litigant
that
this
re-characterization
means
that
any
subsequent
habeas
motion
is
going
to
be
subject
to
those
restrictions
that
apply
to
second
or
successive
habeas
motion,
and
he
has
to
say
to
the
litigant
“you
now
have
the
opportunity
to
withdraw
the
motion
or
amend
it
so
it
contains
all
the
habeas
claims
you
think
you
have.”
now
if
the
court
fails
to
do
that,
then
the
consequence
is
that
the
motion
cannot
be
considered
to
become
a
2255
motion
for
purposes
of
applying
to
later
motions
the
law’s
second
or
successive
requirement.
in
other
words,
unless
the
first
judge
warns
the
pro
se
litigant
about
the
potential
consequences
of
the
re-characterization
a
subsequently
filed
habeas
motion
has
to
be
treated
as
the
first
not
the
second
habeas
motion.
now
because
in
this
case
the
pro
se
litigant’s
rule
33
motion
was
re-characterized
without
any
warning,
the
subsequent
2255
motion
should
not
have
been
treated
as
his
second
it
should
have
been
treated
as
his
first.
we
therefore
vacate
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
our
resolution
of
the
jurisdictional
question
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
thomas
joins.
