justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
the
government
who
intruded
2255
into
this
case.
the
district
judge
didn't
suggest
it.
the
prisoner,
who
never
appeared
before
the
court,
certainly
didn't
suggest
it.
2255,
as
i
understand,
was
first
uttered
by
the
government
in...
in
its
pleading
to
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
no
one
had
proposed
it
other
than
the
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
government
was...
i
take
it,
was
intending
to
be
helpful.
they
thought
that
2255
was
a
better
rubric.
why
i
don't
know.
it
isn't
clear
even
now.
the...
the
district
judge
in
the
end
i...
didn't
he
say
i'll
treat
it
as
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what...
at
what
point
did
mr.
castro
get
representation?
not
at
this
stage
he
didn't
have
any
lawyer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
throughout
the
original
rule--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
even
when
he...
his
first
styled
2255,
he
was
still
pro
se
until
that
one
went
up
on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
raising
a
question
on
appeal,
it's
more
likely,
if
he
had
counsel,
that
the
pro
se
prisoner
gets
to
see
a
document
that
starts
out
by
saying
you
made
a
rule
33
motion,
and
the
bottom
line
is,
as
you
pointed
out,
your
motion
is
denied,
and
that
2255
comes
up
only
in
the
body
of
the
opinion.
that
is
something
that
a
lawyer
is
far
more
likely
to
spot
than
a
pro
se
prisoner
who
sees
i
made
a
motion
under
rule
33,
and
the
bottom
line
is
this
judgment
is
my
motion
is
denied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frick,
the
other...
some
of
the
other
courts
of
appeals
have
given
the
district
court
instructions
about
how
they
should
deal
with
cases
of
recharacterization.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
tests
are
not
identical.
of
the
array
of
instructions
to
district
judges
to
deal
with
this
situation,
which
do
you
think
is
the
soundest
approach?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
the
u.s.
attorney
who
said,
your
honor,
i
don't
object...
this
is
a
rule
33
motion,
but
introduced
2255.
why
didn't
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
advise
the
pro
se
litigant
of
the
consequences
of
that
recharacterization?
if
the
u.s.
attorney
is
going
to
take
a
pleading
that
a
prisoner
puts
in
and
says
this
is
my
rule
33
motion
and
for
whatever
benign
purpose,
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
thinks
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
treat
it
as
a
2255,
didn't
someone
have
an
obligation
to
alert
the
prisoner
of
the
consequences
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
himmelfarb,
the...
the
reality
is
we
have
a
pro
se
litigant
who
loses
in
the
district
court.
he
gets
a
piece
of
paper
that
says,
your
motion
under
rule
33
is
now
being
disposed
of,
and
then
the
bottom
line
says,
your
motion
is
denied.
do
you
really
think
that
a
pro
se
litigant
forfeits
his
rights
to
raise
what
may
be
a
very
important
substantive
question
on
habeas
because
he
didn't
know
to
look
to
the
body
of
the
opinion
that
said
something
about
2255
and
that
that's
a
forfeiture?
i
mean,
even
a
lawyer
might
have
missed
it
when
the
thing
starts
out,
this
is
a
rule
33
motion,
motion
denied.
that's
what
you're
urging,
that
that
kind
of
forfeiture
be
visited
on
a
pro
se
prisoner
who
was
uncounseled
and
never
appeared
before
any
court
to
be
told
anything.
that
strikes
me
as
the
government
not
turning
square
corners.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
right
to
know
the
consequences
of
what
you're
doing.
you
can...
a
forfeiture
is
usually
knowing.
here,
this
litigant
had
no
reason
to
know
about
anything
other
than
he
was
appealing
from
the
denial
of
his
rule
33
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
my
question
to
you
is,
did
he
have
any
reason
to
know?
you
say
he
put
in
his
objection,
yes.
then
he
gets
a
document
that
only
in
the
body
refers
to
2255.
why
couldn't
he
reasonably
see
that
piece
of
paper
as
saying,
you
filed
a
rule
33
motion,
your
motion
is
denied?
i
mean,
you
are
loading
a
lot
onto
a
pro
se
litigant
who
has
never
appeared
before
any
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
usually
courts
do
their
best
when
they
deal
with
pro
se
litigants
to
have
them
understand
what's
going
on.
i
mean,
we
have
all
kinds
of
procedures
in
our
criminal
justice
system
just
to
assure
that
people
will
understand
what
the
rules
are
and
what
the
pitfalls
are.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you're
not
relying
on
aedpa
on
this
branch
of
the
case.
we're
back
before
the
days
of
aedpa.
you're
saying
because
he
didn't
in
his
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
rule
33
motion
say,
and
p.s.,
court
of
appeals,
there
was
a
mischaracterization...
all
of
that
happened
before
aedpa,
and
that's
what
you're
holding
him
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just...
you
just
agreed.
you
said
you
had
no
reservation
about
what
these
other
courts
have
said
must
go
on
in
the
district
courts.
you
just
don't
think
that
this
is
a
proper
case
because
there's
no
jurisdiction.
but
you...
you
are
recognizing
that
courts,
wanting
to
do
justice,
do
and
should
inform
litigants
of
the
consequences.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
principle,
you
have
no
objection.
what
about
in
practice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is...
is
there
one
of
the
circuits
that
has
taken
the
position
that
you,
in
principle
and
in
practice,
would
say
is
a
sound
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
the...
doesn't
that...
isn't
that
included
in
the
third
circuit
formulation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
should
give
an
opportunity
to...
to
say
i'll
withdraw
my
petition
or
i'll
amend
my
petition
to
say
everything
that
i
could
say
under
the
heading
of
2255.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
the
position
that
any
of
the
circuits
have
taken.
