mr.
dan
himmelfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
review
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
because
the
court
of
appeals
denied
authorization
to
file
a
second
or
successive
2255
motion.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
stevens,
the
interpretive
question
we
think
that's
presented,
as
far
as
the
jurisdictional
issue
goes,
is
whether
a
denial
of
authorization
is
simply
a
finding
that
the
gatekeeping
requirements
have
not
been
satisfied
or
rather
whether
it
encompasses
both
that
determination
and
the
subsidiary
determination
that
the
motion
is
in
fact
second
or
successive.
it's
our
position
that
it
is
a
single
order
encompassing
both.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no.
there...
there
are
two
circumstances
when
it
can.
one
is
the
martinez-villareal
situation,
and
there
this
court
had
jurisdiction
because
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
motion
was
not
second
or
successive
and
so
didn't
grant
or
deny
authorization.
so
it
didn't
fall
within
2244(b)(3)(e).
the
second
situation
will
be
one
where
the
court
of
appeals
finds
that
the
motion
is
second
or
successive
and
doesn't
go
on
to
reach--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
it
depends
upon,
as
the
statute
makes
clear,
whether
there
was
a
grant
or
denial
of
authorization.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
the
second
instance...
let
me
back
up
to
try
to
answer
that
as
clearly
as
i
can.
the
ordinary
case
where
a
court
of
appeals
is
able
to
address
the
question
whether
the
district
court
properly
found
that
a
motion
was
second
or
successive
is
a
case
where
a
motion
for
authorization
to
file
the
motion
is
filed
in
a
court
of
appeals.
that's
because
in
many
circuits,
once
a
district
court
finds
that
a
motion
is
second
or
successive,
it's
obligated
to
transfer
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
so
it
can
make
the
gatekeeping
determination.
and
even
in
cases
where
a
district
court
is
permitted
to
dismiss
and
does
rather
than
transfer,
and
once
it's
found
that
the
motion
is
second
or
successive,
it's
going
to
be
a
rare
case
where
the
defendant
is
able
to
take
an
appeal
from
the
dismissal
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
slack
v.
mcdaniel,
he'll
only
be
able
to
get
a
certificate
of
appealability
if
he
makes
two
showings:
first,
that
the
procedural
ruling
that
it
was
second
or
successive
is
subject
to
debate
among
reasonable
jurists;
and
in
addition
to
that,
that
there
was
some
underlying
constitutional
claim
that
has
arguable
merit.
so
in
a
rare
circumstance,
when
an
appeal
can
be
taken
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
motion
is
second
or
successive,
and
in
the
rare
circumstance
where
the
court
of
appeals,
after
affirming
that
finding,
does
not
go
on
to
reach
the
gatekeeping
issue,
as
courts
of
appeals
often
do
just
to
bring
the
case
to
a
close,
that
will
be
the
rare
case
where
there
has
been
a
court
of
appeals'
finding
that
the
motion
is
second
or
successive,
but
yet
no
grant
or
denial
such
that
2244(b)(3)(e)
does
not
deprive
this
court
of
jurisdiction.
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
so
long
as
there
is
a
grant
or
denial
of
authorization,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
cannot
be
second-guessed.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
the
interpretive
question
is
whether
a
denial
of
authorization
under
2244(b)(3)(e)
is
simply
a
finding
that
the
gatekeeping
requirements
haven't
been
satisfied
or
whether
it's
both
that
and
the
subsidiary
finding
that
the
motion
is
second
or
successive.
nobody
would
take
the
position
i
think
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
finds
the
gatekeeping
requirements
not
satisfied
and
therefore
denies
authorization,
and
yet
manifestly
errs
in
so
finding,
this
court
would,
nevertheless,
have
jurisdiction
to
review
it.
there's
no
manifest
error
exception
to
2244(b)(3)(e).
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
we
think
it
is.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
think
the
statute
does
say
that,
justice
kennedy,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
2244(b)(3)(e)
speaks
at...
speaks
of
a
denial
of
authorization.
if
congress
had
intended
that
to
mean
only
a
finding
that
the
gatekeeping
requirements
had...
had
not
been
satisfied,
it
could
have
used
narrower
language,
as
indeed
it
did
in
2244(b)(3)(c)
which
refers
specifically
to
the
gatekeeping
requirements.
we
think
that's
the
first
textual
indication
that
our
position
is
correct.
the
second
textual
indication
is
that
in
2244(b)(3)(a)
and
(b)(3)(b),
congress
speaks
of
an
order
authorizing
the
district
court
to
consider
the
application.
we
think
it's
reasonable
to
view
an
order
granting
or
denying
an
authorization
to
be
synonymous
with
2244(b)(3)(e)'s
reference
to
a
grant
or
denial
of
authorization.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
our
view
is
that
the
statute
is
not
ambiguous.
after
applying
all
the
relevant
tools
of
statutory
construction,
the
best
reading
of
it
is
that
congress
intended
to
include
the
subsidiary
determination
when
it
said
that
this
court
may
not
review
a
denial
of
authorization.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
justice
breyer,
you
could
imagine
a
case
where
there
is
a
very
serious
constitutional
claim
raised,
but
there's
absolutely
no
dispute
that
it's
being
raised
in
a
second
or
successive
motion,
and
the
defendant
can't
satisfy
at
the
substantive
gatekeeping
requirements.
the
court
of
appeals
says
it's
second
or
successive.
you
don't
satisfy
the
gatekeeping
requirements.
we
deny
authorization.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
take
the
view
that
under
2244(b)(3)(e)
that
defendant
would,
nevertheless,
be
able
to
seek
certiorari
from
this
court.
so
the
whole
point
of
2244(b)(3)(e)
is
to
give
the
court
of
appeals
the
final
say.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
what
my
opponent
is
appealing
is
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
which
is
a
single
order,
which
does
two
things.
it
affirms
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
motion
was
second
or
successive,
and
then
goes
on
repeatedly
to
say
that
under
aedpa's
gatekeeping
requirements,
he
may
not
file
it.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
authorization
to
file
the
motion
under
2244(b)(3)(e).
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
true,
justice
stevens.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
it's...
as...
as
i've
said,
the
ordinary
way
that
a
defendant
is
able
to
challenge
a
district
court's
determination
that
his
motion
is
second
or
successive
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
via
appeal
because
ordinarily
either
the
case
has
been
transferred
or
he
can't
get
a
certificate
of
appealability.
so
he
does
it
in
the
context
of
an
authorization
motion.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
may
find--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true.
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point.
in
many
cases
within
the
category
of
the
rare
case
where
a
defendant
is
able
to
take
an
appeal
from
a
dismissal
of
a
motion
as
second
or
successive,
after
the
court
of
appeals
affirms
the
finding
that
the
motion
is
second
or
successive,
it
will
often
go
on
to
treat
the
appeal
as
an
implied
request
for
authorization
to
file
the
motion
because
otherwise
you've
got
a
lingering
question
of
whether
this
motion
found
to
be
second
or
successive
can
or
cannot
be
filed,
and
it
will
reach
that
question
just
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
close.
it's
our
position,
of
course,
that
if
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
should
be
affirmed.
the
district
court
treated
petitioner's
first
post-conviction
motion
as
one
that
sought
relief
under
two
different
provisions
of
federal
law,
rule
33--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
ginsburg,
we
do
not
defend
what
was
done
in
the
district
court
in
connection
with
the
first
post...
post-conviction
motion.
we
do
not
take
the
position--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--yes,
it
did,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
in...
in
some
respects
they
were
the
same;
in
some
respects
they
were
different.
we
think,
for
relevant
purposes,
they
were
the
same.
this
court
has
characterized
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine,
which
of
course
predated
aedpa,
as
a
modified
res
judicata
rule.
a
slightly
less
modified
res
judicata
rule
is
codified
in
aedpa.
but
at
least
since
mccleskey
v.
zant,
which
is
a
1991
decision,
a
prisoner
was
presumptively
entitled
to
file
only
one
2255
motion.
the
showing
he
would
have
to
make
to
be
able
to
file
a
second
one
was
slightly
different
and
slightly
easier
to
make
than
it
is
post--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true,
justice
o'connor,
and--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that...
that
is
true
as
well.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
motion
was
properly
characterized
as
a
2255
motion.
we
take
two
positions.
one
is
that
the
court
may
not
reach
that
question
because
it
lacks
jurisdiction,
and
second,
that
if
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction,
it
should
not
reach
that
question
because
there
was
a
forfeiture.
the
characterization
could
have
been
appealed,
but
wasn't.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
o'connor,
we
have
no
objection
in
principle
to
requiring
that...
to...
to
a
rule
requiring
that
a
district
court
provide
a
defendant
with
notice
before
characterizing
a
post-conviction
motion
as
a
2255
motion.
our
position
is
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
i'll
answer
that
question.
before
i
do,
i
just
want
to
make
clear
that
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
to
do
that
because
our
view
is
that
any
objection
to
notice,
either
a
lack
of
notice
or
an
inadequate...
inadequacy
of
notice
has
to
be
made
in
connection
with
a
motion
that's
characterized.
and
once
you
get
to
a
subsequent
stage
of
the
litigation,
it's
too
late
for
that
to
happen.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
ginsburg,
we
don't
think
that's
the
case
at
all.
there
is,
of
course,
no
right
to
counsel
in
connection
with
post-conviction
litigation
and
the
vast
majority
of--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--the...
the
defendant
in
this
case,
petitioner,
did
litigate
the
question
of
characterization.
when
the
government
in
its
opposition
to
his
rule
33
motion
recommended
that
it
be
treated
as
both
a
rule
33
motion
and
a
2255
motion,
in
his
reply
he
objected.
he
took
the
position
that
it
should
not
be
treated
as
a
2255
motion
and
should
be
treated
only
as
a
rule
33
motion.
so
he
was
aware
of...
of
what
was
being
done
and
he
felt
that
it
was
a
significant
enough
decision
that
it
should
be
litigated,
and
he
objected.
our
position
is
that
he
should
have
continued
to
object.
aedpa
imposes
all
types
of
restrictions
on
post-conviction
litigation.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
he
is
pro
se
should
have
any
part
in
the
analysis
because
that
would
create
all
sorts
of
difficulties
in
other
aedpa
cases
where
you
have
difficult
questions,
particularly
difficult,
perhaps
byzantine,
procedural
rules
that
a
petitioner
is
obligated
to
follow.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
aedpa
is
not
one
of
those
statutes.
once
a...
a
defendant
who
files
a
self--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
but
even
before
aedpa,
the
rules
governing
post-conviction
litigation
could
be
quite
difficult
to
navigate,
and
even
before
aedpa,
most
post-conviction
litigation
was
carried
out
pro
se.
there
are
two
different
places
in...
in
the
district
court--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
court
with
that
impression.
i
think
i
started
to
answer
another
justice's
question
and
in...
in
answering
it,
i
said
that
in
principle
we
have
no
objection
to
a
rule
requiring
notice
before
recharacterization.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
in
practice
as
well.
it's
the
nature
of
the
notice
that
i
wanted
to
say
a
little
bit
more
about.
some
of
the
decisions
on
which
petitioner
relies
have...
have
language
in
them
that
not
only...
suggesting
that
not
only
must
the
defendant
be
notified
that
the
district
court
plans
to
treat
the
motion
as
a
2255
motion,
but
also
that
he
be
warned
of
its
consequences.
we
have
no
objection
insofar
as
there's
a
requirement
that
he
be
notified
of
how
it
would
be
treated.
we
don't
think
there
should
be
warnings
about
the
consequences.
once
a
defendant
is
notified
that
the
motion
is
going
to
be
treated
as
a
2255
motion,
he
stands
in
no
different
position
from
somebody
who's
filed
a
self-styled
2255
motion,
and
the
law
has
never
required
that
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
think
if...
if
we
had
to
choose,
we
would
prefer
the
third
circuit's
rule
under
which
essentially
there
are
three
options
when
a
post-conviction
motion,
not
styled
a
2255
motion,
is
filed.
the
defendant
has
the
option
of
having
it
ruled
upon
as
filed.
he
can
be
given
notice
that
it's
going
to
be
recharacterized,
and
it
will
be
recharacterized,
or
he
can
withdraw
it
so
that
he
will
not
be
prevented
from
filing
a
second--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--our
view
is
that
the
first
circuit's
view,
which
does
not
require
notice
but
simply
says
that
if
there
is
no
notice,
the
second
motion
is
deemed
to
be
a
first
motion,
should
not
be
adopted
because
we
think
it's
inconsistent
with
the
basic
principle
of
post-conviction
litigation,
which
we're
urging
this
court
to
adopt
in
this
case,
that
you
have
to
file
your
challenges
to
rulings
made
against
you
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity.
the
first
circuit's
rule,
in
effect,
gives
the
defendant
a
right
to
file
a
later
appeal.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
don't--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--yes.
we
don't
aedpa
can
reasonably
be
read
to
say
that
a
2255
motion
is
one
that
is
characterized
as
not
filed
as
one,
but
is
characterized
one
after
notice,
and
that
if
there's
no
notice,
it's
not
a
2255
motion.
our
position
on
notice
is
that
it's
essentially
an
adjunct
of
the
prior
decision
to
recharacterize.
and
i
want
to
be
clear.
recharacterization,
particularly
in
a
post-aedpa
world,
does
not
benefit
only
the
defendant,
a
defendant
who
might
be
able...
might
not
be
able
to
get
his
claim
ruled
upon
if
it's
not
recharacterized.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no.
our
position--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--to
the
extent
that
the
court
wishes
to
impose
a
notice
requirement,
our
view
is
that
it
should
go
essentially
like
this.
it
is
important
to
recharacterize
a
post-conviction
motion
not
styled
a
2255
motion
if
it
seeks
relief
available
only
under
2255.
it's
important
because
it
can
help
the
defendant.
it's
also
important
because
if
it's
not
recharacterized,
you
run
the
risk
that
congress'
clear
purpose
to
prohibit
second
or
successive
post-conviction
motions
could
be
evaded.
we...
that...
that
is
essentially
a
judge-made
rule,
recharacterization.
we
think,
as
a
matter
of
fairness
and
also
as
a
matter
of
reducing
potential
litigation,
it
is
appropriate,
once
you've
got
the
judge-made
rule
that
says
you
should
recharacterize,
to
go
further
and
say,
before
you
do,
notice
has
to
be
given.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
it
probably...
i
think
it
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
only
point
is
that
if
there's
going
to
be
a
recharacterization
and
there's
going
to
be
notice,
the
only
notice
should
be
i
plan
to
recharacterize.
we
don't
think
that
the
district
court
should
give
any
kinds
of
warnings
about
the
consequences
of
recharacterization
for
the
reasons
i
gave
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
it
may
well
be.
i
think
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
take
the
view
that
you
should
not
only
give
notice
of
the
intent
to
recharacterize,
you
should
also
give
some
sort
of
warnings
about
the
consequences
of
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--our
view
is
that
giving
notice
of
an
intent
to
recharacterize
puts
the
defendant
in
the
same
position
as
one
who
filed
a
self-styled
2255,
and
under
the
law
of
post-conviction
litigation,
such
a
defendant
is
held
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
filing
that
motion.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
that...
i
think
that's
probably
right.
i
think
they...
to
the
extent
they
require
notice,
within
that
notice,
they
think
there
should
be
some
warning
about
the
consequences
of
characterization.
we
think
that
that
can't
be
reconciled
with
the
fact
that
there's
a
detailed
procedural
scheme
governing
post-conviction
motions
and
congress
said
nothing
about
warnings
as
it
did,
for
example,
in
the
context--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
stevens,
the
way
we
envision
the
regime
working
is
that
the
motion
is
filed
and
the
district
court
issues
an
order
which
it
serves
on
parties,
giving
notice
that
it
intends
to
recharacterize
and
some
amount
of
time
will
elapse
before
the
defendant
is
obligated
to
come
back
to
the
court
and
tell
the
court
whether
it
wishes
for
the
court
to
go
forward
with
recharacterization
or
allow
him
to
withdraw.
so
within
that
period
of--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
i
think
that's
reasonably
encompassed--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true.
no
notice
was
given
here.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
souter,
the...
the
purpose
of
helping
defendants
is
not
the
only
reason
for
recharacterization.
it
also
serves
the
interest
of
vindicating
congress'
purpose
in
enacting
the
bar
on
second
or
successive
motions
in
aedpa.
it
vindicates...
this
court
made
that
clear--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--thank
you,
your
honor.
