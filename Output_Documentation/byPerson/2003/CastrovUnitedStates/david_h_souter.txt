justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
on
the
other
side
that
although,
of
course,
there
was
no
aedpa
at
that
point,
we
did
have
a...
a
structure
of...
of
rules
governing
abuse
of
the
writ
and
second
and
successive
petitions
and
that
he
would
have...
he
would
have
run
afoul
of
those
rules,
or
at
least
there
was
reason
to
be
concerned
that
he
might
run
afoul
of
those
rules,
and
therefore,
the
enactment
of
aedpa
really
shouldn't
make
any
difference
in
our
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'll...
i'll
stipulate
here
that
they're...
you
know,
they're
not
exactly
identical.
but
the
argument
is
your
concern
basically
here
with
the
unfairness
of
tagging
him
with
an
earlier
petition,
and
it's
unfair
because
of
the...
the
consequences
under
aedpa.
and
they're
saying
it
would
have
been
just
as
unfair
or
just
as
fair
in
the
pre-aedpa
law.
it's
a
fairness
argument.
what
do...
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
what...
what
do
you
say?
what
do
you
say?
what's
your
answer
to
the
government?
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
the...
is
the
basic
difference
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that's
a
tough
standard,
whereas
under
our
prior
law,
you...
you
didn't
have
to
go
through
that
step?
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
point
of
implausibility
i...
i
have
with
your
argument
is
that
when
the
district...
your
argument
to
the
effect
that
no
notice
of
consequence
needs
to
be
given,
merely
a
notice
that
recharacterization
will
take
place.
the...
the
point
is
that
when
a
point
does
that,
the
court
is
understood
to
be
trying
to
help
out
the
defendant.
whether
the
court
puts
it
in
precisely
those
words
or
not,
that's...
that's
the
object.
the...
the
court,
in
effect,
is
saying,
look,
i'm
going
to
help
you
here
because
you
don't
know
how
to
plead
this
stuff,
and...
and
i'm
going
to
recharacterize
this
as
under
2255.
it
seems
very
odd
for
the
court,
in
effect,
to
be
in
the
position
of
saying,
i'm
going
to
help
you
out
by
recharacterizing
and
at
the
same
time
keep
its
mouth
shut
about
the
fact
that
when
it
does
recharacterize,
the
consequence
is
going
to
be
that
that
fellow
is
going
to
be
out
on
his
ear
if
he
ever
wants
to
walk
in
with
another
claim
that
could
have
been
made
under
2255.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
courts
are
going
to
help,
they've
got
to
help
in
a...
in
a
way
that
does
not
mislead
the
defendant,
and
your
argument
says
they
can
help,
as
it
were,
in
a
way
that
does
mislead
him.
