well,
but
isn't...
isn't
there
another
point
that
filing
a
legitimate...
maybe...
on
the
merits
motion
for
new
trial
on
ground
a
and
later...
and...
and
having
it
denied,
then
later
filing
a
2255
on
ground
b
under
our
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine...
that
would
not
have
been
an
abuse
of
the
writ,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
your
position,
though,
you
don't
even
have
to
read
strict
construction.
you...
i
think
it's
your
view,
isn't
it,
that
subsection
(e)
just
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
whether
we
have
jurisdiction
over
a
decision
by
a
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
petition
is
second
or
successive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
only
if
you
know
that
it's
a
second
or
a
successive
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is...
is
it
your
view
that
the
court
would
never
have
jurisdiction
to
review
a
determination
by
a
court
of
appeals
that
a
petition
was
or
was
not
a
second
or
successive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
our
jurisdiction
depends
on
how
the
court
of
appeals
resolved
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
do
you
say
to
his
point
that
he
didn't
even
try
to
file
a...
try
to
seek
an
authorization
to
file
a
second
or
successive
because
he
never
thought
it
was
a
second
or
successive?
he
did
not
seek
authorization
to
file
such
a
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
how
can
you
have
denied
such
an
authorization?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
he
didn't
file
an
authorization
motion
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
a
difference
between
a
case
in
which
a
litigant
makes
up
his
mind
to
file
a
2255...
presumably
he
should
have
found
out
what's
the
consequence
of
that...
and
the
situation
in
which
he
files
something
else
and
the
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
change
it?
how
does
he
know
what
the
consequences
are
if
he
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
think
it
through?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
say
the
recharacterization
could
not
take
place
until
after
there
was
that
time...
notice
and
a
time
to
accept
or
object
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which,
of
course,
didn't
happen
here.
