justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
pro
se,
castro
filed
an
appeal
from
the
merits
determination
of
the
district
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
didn't
raise,
as
an
issue,
the
treatment
of
his...
the
recharacterization--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
also
consider--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
what
are
we
to
make
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
the
time
mr.
castro
appealed,
had
aedpa
been
enacted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hum.
we
can
find
it
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
thought,
frankly,
that
he
had
appealed
in
march
of
1996
and
aedpa
was
enacted
in
april.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wasn't
that
all...
didn't
that
occur
before
aedpa
had
been
passed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
there
the
same
consequences
then
as
there
were
post-aedpa?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
he...
he
never...
he
did
not
in
the
district
court
file
such
a
motion.
he
filed
this
rule
33(b)
thing,
that
the
government
then
volunteered
it
wouldn't
mind
if
the
court
treated
as
a
2255
and
the
district
court
treated
it
as
such.
it
was
not
castro's
urging.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
was
no
enactment
at
that
time
of
aedpa.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this...
this
business
of
having
a
court
recharacterize
a
motion
as
a
2255
motion
was
a
doctrine
that
seems
to
have
been
developed
before
aedpa
was
enacted,
and
some
circuits
since
the
enactment
of
aedpa
have
decided
that
if
they're
going...
if
the
district
court
is
going
to
do
that,
that
some
notice
should
be
given,
certainly
to
a
pro
se
petitioner,
about
the
consequences
of
that
recharacterization.
now,
should
we
propose
such
a
rule
or
adopt
such
a
rule
in
our
supervisory
capacity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
were
to
do
it,
which...
which
version
would
be
the
best?
