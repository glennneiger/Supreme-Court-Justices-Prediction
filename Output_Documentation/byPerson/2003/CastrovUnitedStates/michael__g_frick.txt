mr.
michael
g.
frick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
holding
that
hernan
o'ryan
castro's
first
titled
28
u.s.c.,
section
2255
petition
was
second
or
successive
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996,
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
placed
itself
in
conflict
with
every
other
court
of
appeals
circuit
in
the
united
states,
save
the
fifth,
in
how
they
view
or
treat
the
impact
of
a
prior
post-conviction
motion
which
has
been
sua
sponte
recharacterized
or
treated
as
a
2255
petition
by
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
that
is
absolutely
correct.
it
is
a
judge-made...
it
is
a
judge-made
thing.
it
is
something
that
has
been...
that
has
grown
up
among
the
courts
in
an
attempt
to
save
what
would
otherwise
be
generally
in
the
case
of
a
pro
se
prisoner,
a
facially
deficient
or
an
ineptly
pleaded
document,
and
by
recharacterizing
it,
it's
trying
to
take
substance
and
putting
into
form
so
that
the
court
can
actually
rule
on
the
substance
of
the
particular
motion
that
was
pleaded.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
justice
kennedy,
at
the
present
time
recharacterization
in
our
opinion
should
only
be
done
at
such
time
as
the
court
determines
that
there
is
absolutely
no
viable
way
that
it's
going
to
be
able
to
take
the
document
as
pleaded
under
the
title
that
it's
given
to
the
court
and
effectuate
a
remedy
therefrom.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that,
as
in
the
adams
and
miller
cases
from
the
second
and
third
circuits,
that
at
the
present
time,
under
the
restrictions
of
the
aedpa,
that
a
recharacterization
should
never
take
place
by
a
court
unless
there
is
concurrence
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
himself
and
he's
given
the--
mr.
michael
g.
frick
--yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes,
sir,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
the
government's
part
to
ask
the
court
to
recharacterize
something.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
no,
your
honor.
there--
mr.
michael
g.
frick
--no,
your
honor,
but
the
d.c.
circuit...
but
first
of
all,
all
of
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
except
for
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
have
addressed
issues,
have
addressed
circumstances
under
which
recharacterization
was
done
of
certain
motions
that
were
pleaded
in
order
to
help
ostensibly
the
individual
who
pled
the
motion.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
no,
they
did
not
ask
that
it
be
recharacterized,
your
honor.
what
they
said
is
that
they
had
no
objection
to
it
being
considered
as
also
seeking
relief
under
2255.
but
my
client,
mr.
castro,
had
presented
to
the
court,
unlike
in
virtually
all
of
the
other
cases
in
the
other
circuits...
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
makes
this
such
a
strong
case
for
mr.
castro...
his
rule
33
motion
was
absolutely
correct
in
all
respects
insofar
as
seeking
the
remedy
that
he
did.
the
eleventh
circuit's
initial
opinion
in
this
case,
in
fact,
recognized
the
opinion
that
it
later
vacated
sua
sponte...
actually
recognized
the
fact
that
he
had
brought
a
proper
rule
33
motion
under...
under
brady.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
no,
your
honor.
it
is,
nonetheless,
a
motion
that
does
not
require
recharacterization
in
order
for
the
court
to
get
to
the
merits
of
the
issue
presented.
the
district
court--
mr.
michael
g.
frick
--that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
court...
the
district
court's
order,
interestingly
enough,
starts
out
by
saying
we
have
before
us
hernan
o'ryan
castro's
motion
for
a
new
trial
under
rule
33,
and
then
it
ends
in
conclusion
by
stating
for
the
above
reasons,
we
deny
hernan
o'ryan
castro's
rule
33
motion
for
new
trial.
it
is
only
in
the
body
of
the
opinion
itself
that
there
is
reference
to
the
government
having
requested
that
it
also
be
considered
as
requesting
relief
under
2255
and
that
they
would,
therefore,
take
that
consideration.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
your
honor,
if
i
stated
that,
i'm
incorrect.
the
government
suggested...
the
government
stated
that
it
had
no
objection,
as
your...
as
your
honor
has
stated.
it
had
no
objection
to
it
being
so
characterized.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
that's
correct.
not
up
until
that
point
in
time,
there
had
been
no
suggestion
whatsoever
of
2255--
mr.
michael
g.
frick
--yes,
your
honor.
he...
he
said
that
he
would
treat
it
as
seeking
relief
under
both
rule
33
and
2255.
mr.
castro,
in
his
brief
in
response
to
the
government's
brief,
stated
that
i
didn't
file
a...
a
2255
and
i
object
to
it
being
characterized
or
considered
as
seeking
relief
under
2255.
but
there
was
no
argument
on
the
point,
and
it
was
never
anything
that...
where
argument
was
presented
other
than
through
the
briefs
on
that
issue.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
we...
we
were
not
appointed
by
the
court
until
this
matter
had
gone
before
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
who
vacated
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
remanded
it
because
the...
now
we're
talking
about
the
subsequently
filed
2255.
the...
the
first
titled
2255
that
was
filed
several
years
later.
it
was
not
until
that
was
on
appeal
that
the
eleventh
circuit
appointed
counsel...
had
the
district
court
appoint
counsel.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
totally
pro
se.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
that
was
not
raised...
that
was
not
raised
as
an
issue
by
him
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
we
make
nothing
of
it.
the
government
has
suggested
that
this
places
this
case
under
one
of
three
things.
it's
law
of
the
case,
or
if
the
court
doesn't
buy
law
of
the
case,
then
look
at
either
waiver
or
forfeiture
to
the
extent
that
there
may
be
some
difference
between
those
two
particular
things.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
at
the
time
that
he
appealed?
mr.
michael
g.
frick
i...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
we...
we
have
two
or
three
different
appeals.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes,
your
honor.
at
page
147
of
the
joint
appendix
there's
a
march
19th,
1996
eleventh
circuit
affirmance
of
the
district
court
denial
of
the
rule
33
motion
for
new
trial,
and
in
that
order
the
court
states
that
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
relief
in
regard
to
a
combined
motion
to
vacate,
set
aside,
or
correct
sentence,
2255,
and
motion
for
new
trial.
of
course,
it
is
our
contention
that
that
statement
is
not
actually
accurate
because
there
had
never
been
a
motion
filed
by
anyone
seeking
relief
under
2255.
it
had
simply
been
a
characterization.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
i
believe
that
that
was
the...
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is...
that
is
correct
from
the
standpoint--
mr.
michael
g.
frick
--yes,
your
honor,
and
not
only
that,
but
not
only
was
this
a
pre-aedpa
filing
of
the
rule
33
plus
recharacterization
at
that
time,
it
was
a
denial
of
the...
that
relief,
that
joint
relief,
pre-aedpa.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
well,
your
honor,
i...
the
government's
brief
seems
to
pretty
much
equate
abuse
of
the
writ
with
the
restrictions
placed
under
2255.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes,
sir.
i...
i
believe
that
the
other
circuits
of
this
country,
courts
of
appeals,
have
addressed
the
difference
between
the
abuse
of
the
writ
and
the
impact
of
having
filed
an
initial
2255
under
aedpa
and
having
that.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
i
say
that
there
is
a
significant
difference
as
stated
by
those
other
circuits
between
the
difficulty
in
getting
a
second
petition
filed
under
abuse
of
the
writ.
it...
it
wasn't
as
difficult
to
get
a
second
petition
filed.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
that
would
certainly
be
one
of
the
differences,
your
honor.
but
the
recharacterization
itself
in
mr.
castro's
case
was
not
to
his
benefit.
there...
there's
no
contention
that
the
government
did
it
to
legally
entrap
him,
but
that's
the
circumstance
that
he
ultimately
found
himself
in,
having
had
the
court
recharacterize
it,
so
to
speak.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
it's
also
important,
i
believe,
to...
to
consider
that
while
mr.
castro
was...
while
mr.
castro
was
pro
se,
that's
not...
that's
not
a
critical
element
in
connection
with
this
case.
these
same
pitfalls
would
have
befallen
attorneys
representing
him
with
a
recharacterization
problem
as...
as
it
was
done
at
that
time,
although
i'm
not
so
sure
that
the
government
would
have
suggested
that
it
would
not
object
to
it
being
recharacterized
as
a
2255
if
there
had
been
counsel
on
the
other
side
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
point
he
would
have
appealed.
the...
the
district
court's
consideration
of
the
motion
throughout
the
entire
motion
used
the
analysis
of...
of
brady
and
giglio
in
reaching
the
point
that
his
motion
for
new
trial
should
be
denied.
there
was
one
brief
remark
about
2255
and
the
constitutional
application
in
it,
but
it
was
not,
in
effect,
necessary
to
the
decision
that
the
court
rendered.
and
therefore,
i
do
not
believe
that
law
of
the
case
applied.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the...
the
question
presented
before
this
court
is
not
quite
as
narrow
in
our
view
as
looking
specifically
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
with
it
being
a
pre-aedpa
when
most
of
the
other
circuit
cases
are
post-aedpa,
both
in
the
recharacterization
phase
and
in
the
filing
of
a
first
titled
2255.
the
question
that
we
were
asked
pertaining
to
this
court
dealt
with
when
a
first
post-conviction
motion
is
recharacterized
sua
sponte
as
a
2255,
is
a
subsequent
first
titled
2255
rendered
second
or
successive
under
the
aedpa.
the...
the
answer
to
that
is
no
in
our
opinion.
but
the
significance
and
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
there
is
that
the
government's
contention
that
we've
got
a
law
of
the
case
issue...
law
of
the
case
is
very...
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
the
law
of
the
case
is
going
to
ultimately
result
in
other
than
the
determination
that
there
had
been
a
recharacterization
sua
sponte
as
a
2255.
and
under
that
circumstance
that's
what
we're
here
arguing
about.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
under
stillert...
excuse
me...
stewart
v.
martinez-villareal
and
slack
v.
mcdaniel,
this
court
has
already
made
the
determination
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
and
review
a
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision
pertaining
to
whether
or
not
a
first
titled
2255
is
second
or
successive
following
recharacterization.
both
of
those
cases
dealt
with
that
issue.
they
were
different
fact
situations,
but
the
bottom
line
was
this
court
took
jurisdiction
under
those
cases
to
consider
the
issue
of
successive
or
second
petition
under
aedpa.
in
addition,
a...
an
actual
look
at
the
statute,
28
u.s.c.
2244(b)(3)(e),
which
is
in
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief,
appendix
2a,
that
is
the
statute
that
the
government
contends
shows
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
what
that
particular
section
deals
with
is
a
proscription
against
this
court
having
jurisdiction
when
a
court
of
appeals
has
granted
or
denied
a
request
for
authorization
for
a
district
court
to
consider
a
second
or
successive
petition.
that
is
a
recognition
on
the
part...
the
statute
recognizes
that
there
has
been
a
first
2255
so
characterized
as
such,
so
pleaded
as
such
by
the
petitioner,
and
that
he
has
then
come
before
them
with
what
he
recognizes
is
a
second
motion,
and
he's
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
saying,
under
aedpa
there
are
restrictions
that
we
have
not
had
before,
and
i
am
required
to
come
before
you
and
meet
certain
gatekeeping
requirements
in
order
for
the
district
court
to
hear
my
second
or
successive
petition.
there
is
no
first
2255
for
a
second...
for...
for
the
first
titled
2255
to
be
successive
to
or
to
be
second
to.
and
therefore,
section
2244(b)(3)(e)
is
not
applicable.
now,
the
government's
argument
in
that
regard
is
that
because
the
eleventh
circuit
looked
at
the
appeal
and
said,
you
don't
meet
the
gatekeeping
requirements,
that
that
determination
that
it
did
not
meet
the
gatekeeping
requirements
was
a
further
sua
sponte
determination
and
recharacterization
of
his
appeal
into
a
request
for
certificate
of
authorization,
and
that
therefore,
under
that
scenario,
2244(b)(3)(e)
should
serve
as
a
bar
to
jurisdiction.
we
strongly
suggest,
your
honors,
that
that
is
not
the
case.
the
aedpa
and
the...
changed
jurisdiction.
it...
it
limited
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
very
important
habeas
corpus...
habeas
petitions,
and
in
so,
it
should
be
strictly
construed.
the
government
would
have
a
further
sua
sponte
recharacterization
in
this
chain
and
prevent
this
court
from
having
jurisdiction
to
even
hear
the
matter.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
was
simply
addressing
the
government's
position
in
trying
to
craft
a...
a
way
under
2244(b)(3)(e)
to
prevent
this
court
from
having
jurisdiction
of
the
matter.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the...
the
second
circuit
adams
case
sets
forth
probably
the
best
bright
line
test,
that
being
that
the
petitioner...
that...
that
when
a
court
has
a
petition
that
it
thinks
would
better
be
served
as
recharacterized,
that
they
should
inform
the
petitioner
first
that
they
believe
it
should
be
recharacterized
in
order
for
them
to
grant
relief,
that
it
should
be
recharacterized
as
a
2255,
obtain
the
consent
of
the
petitioner,
and
if
they
don't
obtain
the
consent
of
the
petitioner,
then
offer
the
petitioner
the
opportunity
to
withdraw
the
petition
and
file
it
at
a
later
point
in
time,
assuming
that
it
can
be
refiled
at
some
point
in
time,
and
not
be...
not
run
into
problems
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
or
at
least
tell
the
petitioner
that
it
is
going
to
consider
this
recharacterized
and
they've
got
5
days,
10
days
to
add
any
other
constitutional
claims
that
would
appropriately
be
brought
under
a
2255
before
they
will
rule
on
it
so
that--
mr.
michael
g.
frick
--chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
circumstances
i
understand,
not
from
personal
knowledge,
where
recharacterization
does
take
place
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
is
an
attorney.
but
the
actual
process
and...
and
the
recharacterizations
that
have
taken
place
over
the
years
have
been
for
the
benefit
of
a
pro
se
prisoner.
your
honor,
i
know--
mr.

--i
think
when
recharacterization
is
appropriate,
it's
appropriate.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
that
the
issue
of
recharacterization
should
continue
to
come
up.
it
should
continue
to
benefit
pro
se
prisoners
in
particular
and
prisoners
in
general,
but
it
should
only
be
done
under
circumstances
where
the
particular
petition
that
has
been
filed
is
inadequate
or
ineptly
pleaded
and
cannot
be
considered,
under
which
circumstance
it
should
just
then
be
dismissed,
as
the
palmer
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit
has
suggested.
let
the
petitioner
be
the
master
of
his
own
motion
or
petition.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
g.
frick
your
honor,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
waive
rebuttal.
