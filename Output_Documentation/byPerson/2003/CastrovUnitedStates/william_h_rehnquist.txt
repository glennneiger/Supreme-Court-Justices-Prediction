argument

in
no.
02-6683,
hernan
o'ryan
castro
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
frick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
recharacterization
pretty
much
of
a
judge-made
thing?
there's...
there's
no
statute
that
provides
for
it,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
the
government
and
the
trial
court
the
first
time
around
just
said
they
would
have
no
objection,
didn't
they,
having
treated
it
as
a
2254?
they
didn't
urge
that
it
be
recharacterized,
the
rule
33
motion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
you
say
a
proper
rule
33
motion,
you
don't
necessarily
mean
one
on
which
relief
will
be
granted
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
get
exactly
straight
what
the
government
said
because
i
had
thought
the
government
said
it
have...
it
would
have
no
objection.
now,
you're
saying
the
government
requested.
those
are
two
different
things.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
thing
you
might
touch
on,
mr.
frick,
during
the
course,
the
government
contends
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
this
petition.
perhaps
you
might
want
to
discuss
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--at
some
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
recharacterization
done
only
with
pro
se
litigants?
if
i
were
an
attorney,
i'm
not
sure
i'd
be
terribly
happy
to
have
a
lawyer...
to
have
the
judge
say,
well,
this
is
the
wrong
kind
of
writ,
i'm
going
to
treat
it
thus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
frick.
mr.
himmelfarb,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
it...
wouldn't
it
be
much
simpler
just
to
say
if
a
district
court
recharacterizes,
it
must
do
this
without
going
into
when
or
why
you
should
recharacterize?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
himmelfarb.
mr.
frick,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
02-6683
castro
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
