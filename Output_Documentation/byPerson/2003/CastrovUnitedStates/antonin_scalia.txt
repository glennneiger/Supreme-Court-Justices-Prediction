now,
that...
that
would
mean
that
when
the
district
court
decided
to
treat
this
as
being
under
either
or
both
of
those
provisions,
it
was
doing
him
no
harm,
aedpa
not
yet
being
in
existence.
is
that

to

an
opinion
saying
that

for
the
court
to
treat
this...
i
mean,
the
normal
appellate
judge
would
say,
look
it,
you
know,
you
have
nothing
to
complain

if
you
agree
that
you
should
have
been
denied
relief
under
the
other
one.

antonin
scalia
