justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
the
difference
in
the
two?
i'm...
i'm
the
trial
judge
and
i
receive
a
motion
under
rule
33
that's
within
the
time
limits
under
rule
33.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
do
i
recharacterize
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
understand
that...
that
argument
of
yours.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
i'm
asking
is
what
is...
what
factors
does
the
judge
take
into
account
or
should
take
into
account
when
he
or
she
is
asked
to
recharacterize
the
motion?
i...
i
get...
i'm
the
trial
judge.
i
get
a
rule
33
motion,
which
is
within
the
time
limits,
and
then
the
government
or...
says,
now
you
should
recharacterize.
what...
what
are
factors
that
i
consider
when
i
recharacterize?
you...
you
indicate
that
you
should
never
recharacterize
unless
you
have
to
for
some
reason?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
authority
for
that?
if...
if
i
wanted
to
go
look
in...
in
some
manual
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--some
practice
book
to
know
when
i
can
recharacterize,
when
i
can't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
you...
you
want
us
to
simply
adopt
a
rule
for
what
happens,
what
warnings
have
to
be
given,
what
requirements
have
to
be
met,
when
there's
recharacterization.
you're
not
asking
us
to
go
further
and
say
when
recharacterization
is
appropriate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
asking
us
to
address
the...
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
your
second
instance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's...
you...
you
call
it
a
subsidiary
question,
whether
or
not
it's
second
or
successive.
you
want
to
reach
the
gatekeeping
question
first.
that's
not
the
way
the
statute
reads.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
why
isn't
it...
why
isn't
it
a
predicate?
you
read
the
statute.
so
it
says
the
denial
or
grant
of
an
authorization
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
file
what
the
court
of
appeals
finds
is
a
second
or
successive
petition,
but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at
the
very
least,
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
answer
justice
breyer's
concern
that
an
erroneous
determination
here
can
foreclose
the
petitioner
from
exercising
some
very
important
rights.
