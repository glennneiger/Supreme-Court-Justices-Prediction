justice
blackmun
i'm
mixed
up.
i'm
sorry.
maybe...
i
didn't
think
the
case
was
basically
about
taking
water
out
of
the
river.
i
thought
it
was
about
building
something
for
the
purpose
of
taking
water
out.
justice
blackmun
is...
is
it
actually
that
you're
saying...
i
may
have
misread
this
and
so
is
it
actually...
you're
saying
if...
if
somebody...
if
the
governor
of
virginia
goes
to
the
river
with
a
bucket
and
takes
water,
a
little
bit
of
water,
to
wash
some
pans
that
he
has,
that
they
have
to
get
maryland's
permission?
is
it
about
taking
the
water
out
of
the
river?
is
it
about
building
something,
or
both?
justice
blackmun
all
right.
so
now
you're
just
addressing
the
problem
of
taking
water
out
of
the
river.
so
can
a
person
who
lives
next
to
a
river
under
the
common
law
from
1302
or
whatever...
now,
can
he
go
to
the
river
and
just
take
some
water
when
he's
thirsty?
justice
blackmun
yes.
all
right.
so
virginia
is
just
taking
water
when
they
happen
to
have
a
lot
of
people
who
are
thirsty.
[laughter]
so
what's
the...
what's
the
special
thing
about
the
water?
i
thought
it
was
building
a
water
intake
system.
justice
blackmun
all
right.
let's
imagine
there
were
no
building.
then
would
you
have
an
objection?
