justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
all
right,
let's
say
today
after
mills,
for
a
trial
judge
to
instruct
a
jury,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
this
is
a
case
of
utmost
gravity
from
the
standpoint
of
both
the
defendant
and...
and
the
families
of
the
victims?
and
your
verdict
will
be
most
valuable
if
you
are
unanimous
as
to
mitigating
and
aggravating
factors.
you
should
not
surrender
your
individual
views.
if
you
cannot
come
to
that
conclusion,
then
i'll
give
you
further
instructions.
could
a
judge
say
that?
would
that
serve
a
purpose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
too
dangerous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
i've
said
is
right,
that
if
they
are
unanimous
on
all
factors,
that
that's...
that's
the
jury
functioning
at
its
best.
and
you
would
give
further
instructions
in
the
event
that
the
jurors
cannot
surrender...
should
not
surrender
their
individual
views
on
mitigation,
and
if
that's
the
way
it
has
to
come
out,
fine.
but
i
want
you
to
try
to
do
this.
you
think
that
would
be
error?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
my
hypothetical
was
half...
half
completed,
and
then
we'd
have
to
fill
in
what
would
happen
and
i...
i
didn't
bother
to
do
that.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
instruction
i
suggest
in
the
first
instance
is...
is
valuable
and
also
reflects
the
understanding
at
least
pre-mills
that...
that
many
people
in
the
legal
system
had
as
to
the
way
the
jury
functions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
think
for
your
case
you...
you
have
to
amend
your
statement.
if
you
say
this
was
the
general
understanding
as
to
the
way
the
jury
functions
pre-mills,
i
think
you
should
say
pre-lockett
or...
or
you're
in
danger
of
losing
your
teague
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
sympathy
is
a...
a
conflict?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
concept.
excuse
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that's
the
state
making
a
policy
that
its
state
court
judges
will
do
that,
and
that's
different
from
a
federal
intrusion.
