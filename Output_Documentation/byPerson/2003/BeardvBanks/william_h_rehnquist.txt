chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-1603,
jeffrey
a.
beard
v.
george
e.
banks.
mr.
eisenberg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
eisenberg,
tell...
tell
us
exactly
what
you
mean
by
jury
unanimity
because,
you
know,
most
states
require
jury
unanimity
in
the...
in
the
final
verdict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
eisenberg,
the
court
of
appeals
has
changed
its
mind
in
this
area,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it...
did
it
treat
the
frey
case
as
overruling
its
earlier
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
mean
that
teague
is
a
new
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mills
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
to
get
back
a
minute,
mr.
eisenberg,
this
case
was
decided
before
mills
was
decided.
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
the
direct
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
eisenberg.
mr.
flora,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
lockett
didn't
put
it
quite
that
way,
did
it?
i
mean,
frequently
a
later
decision
will
kind
of
characterize
an
earlier
decision
in
a
way
that
tends
to
support
the
later
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
said
that
the...
it
said
the
court
had
to
admit
any
evidence
dealing
with
the
defendant's
character.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
happened
in
lockett
was
quite
different
than
what
was
involved
in
mills.
in
lockett,
evidence
was
offered
to
be
considered
by
the
jury.
the
court
said,
no,
that's
not
what
we
think
of
as
mitigating
evidence.
and
our
court
said,
any
evidence
bearing
on
the
defendant's
character
is
admissible
for
consideration
by
the
jury.
now,
that's
a
long
step
from
the
way
you
describe
mills.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
something
in
1995,
and
you're
talking
now
about
a
case
that
was
over
on
direct
appeal
before
mills
was
decided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
it,
mr.
flora.
thank
you.
mr.
eisenberg,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
eisenberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
in
no.
02-1603,
beard
against
banks
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
