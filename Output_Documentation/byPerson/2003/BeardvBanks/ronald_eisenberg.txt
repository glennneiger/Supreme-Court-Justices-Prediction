mr.
ronald
eisenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
his
trial
in
1983,
george
banks'
team
of
three
defense
lawyers
presented
23
mitigation
witnesses,
including
three
forensic
psychiatrists,
his
mother,
brother,
and
co-workers,
a
priest,
and
two
nuns.
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
that
it
must
consider
any
mitigating
evidence
unless
it
was
unanimous
in
rejecting
it.
now
banks
claims
that
mills
v.
maryland,
a
ruling
of
this
court
made
after
the
completion
of
his
direct
appeal,
entitles
him
to
re-open
his
death
sentence
for
the
killing
of
13
people.
in
fact,
mills
creates
a
new
distinct
rule
regulating
the
manner
of
conducting
a
death
penalty
hearing
that
is
not
applicable
retroactively
and
that
in
any
case
was
reasonably
applied
by
the
state
courts
attempting
to
interpret
it.
the
primary
issue
in
this
case,
though,
is
whether
the
mills
rule
which
prohibits
unanimity
requirements
at
the
mitigation
stage
was
merely
a
minor
application
of
existing
law
dictated
by
prior
precedent
or
whether
it's
instead
teague-barred.
mills
does
cite
lockett
v.
ohio
for
the
general
proposition
that
it's
beyond
dispute
that
the
sentencer,
quote/unquote,
may
not
be
precluded
from
considering
mitigation.
but
before
mills,
the
sentencer,
quote/unquote,
always
referred
to
the
judge
or
the
jury,
never
to
individual
jurors.
that
was
a
leap
made
for
the
first
time
in
mills.
that
was
new.
even
with
a
unanimity
charge,
although
there
wasn't
one
in
this
case,
as
we'll
address,
a
jury
still
considered
the
evidence
in
the
manner
that
juries
historically
have
considered
evidence,
that
is
collaboratively.
until
mills,
the
constitution
had
never
been
read
to
forbid
unanimity
as
to
verdicts,
whether
general
verdicts
or
special
verdicts.
and
even
since
mills,
as
this
court
recently
said
in
jones
v.
united
states,
we
have
long
been
of
the
view
that
the
very
object
of
the
jury
system
is
to
secure
unanimity
by
a
comparison
of
views
and
by
arguments
among
the
jurors
themselves.
so
the
question
of
jury
unanimity,
we
believe,
remained
open
not
only
after
lockett
but
even
within
the
understanding
of
members
of
this
court
at
the
time
of
mills
and
thereafter.
in
fact,
in
mckoy
v.
north
carolina,
decided
2
years
after
mills,
four
justices
of
the
court
rejected
lockett
as
supporting,
let
alone
compelling,
a
rule
against
jury
unanimity.
now,
whether
the
dissenters
in
mckoy
can
be
said
to
be
right
or
wrong
about
the
meaning
of
mills
is
irrelevant
in
this
teague
context.
the
question
is
that
they
believed
that
mills,
not
to
mention
lockett,
did
not
resolve
the
unanimity
question
presented
here.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
excuse
me,
your
honor,
yes.
i
mean
only
at
the
stage
of
finding
whether
particular
mitigating
circumstances
are
present.
that
is
the...
the
jury
unanimity
question
that
was
decided
in
the
mills
and
mckoy
cases,
as
i've
said,
subject
to
dispute,
strong
dispute,
among
the
court
that
continued
even
after
mills.
because
this
is
a
teague
case,
the
question,
as
i've
said,
is
not
whether
mills
was
right
or
mckoy
was
right
or
which
side
can
be
better
defended
now,
but
whether
state
court
judges
reasonably
could
have
known
what
the
outcome
would
be.
and
since
even
within
the
court
there
was
such
continuing
controversy
on
the
matter,
it
cannot
be
said
that
state
judges
reasonably
could
have
known,
and
therefore
the
case
is
teague-barred.
but
that
uncertainty
continued
even
beyond
mckoy
because
in
the
next
similar
case
before
the
court,
walton
v.
arizona,
the
issue
was
presented
on
essentially
the
same
basis
as
the
mills
case
had
been.
the
single
hold-out
juror
scenario,
that
a
single
juror
because
of
a
unanimity
requirement
in
mills
or
because,
in
walton,
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
could
block
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence
and
thereby
mandate
a
death
penalty
case.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
instruction
here
was
basically
the
same
throughout,
that
the
message
as
to
unanimity
regarding
mitigation
or
not
was
basically
the
same
throughout
the
instructions.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
21.
it's
repeated
at
page
26,
and
we
think
embodied
in
the
jury
form...
i'm
sorry...
also
at
pages
66
and
67.
and
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
jury
was
instructed
first
that
it
must
be
unanimous
to
find
aggravation
or
no
mitigation
and
then
that
it
must
unanimously
find
whether
any...
find
aggravating
circumstances
which
outweigh
any
mitigating
circumstances.
but,
of
course,
the
threshold
question
is
whether
the
state
courts
could
even
have
known
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
rule
against
unanimity,
whether
or
not
unanimity
was
actually
required
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
the
walton
case,
as
i've
mentioned,
is
relevant
to
that
question
because
in
walton
the
same
argument
was
at
issue,
and
the
argument
was
that
because
of
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
a
hold-out
juror
or
even
really
12
hold-out
jurors,
so
to
speak,
could
be
somewhat
persuaded
by
mitigating
evidence,
could
think
it
significant,
but
not
quite
past
the
tipping
point
required
by
the
preponderance
standard
and
yet
be
precluded
from
considering
that
evidence
at
all
in
the
weighing
stage.
and
yet,
the
defendant
lost
that
argument
in
walton.
and
again,
the
relevance
for
teague
purposes
is
to
leave
the
state
courts
in
the
position
of
trying
to
determine
before
walton,
before
mckoy,
before
mills,
in
this
case
in
1983
that
the
eighth
amendment
through
the
lockett
case
somehow
precluded
the
establishment
of
unanimity.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--lockett...
lockett--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--excuse
me,
justice
breyer.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
it...
what
it
also
could
have
made
sense
is
that
the
jury
as
a
whole
in
the
historical
manner
of
juries
had
to
consider
the
evidence,
and
there's
no
doubt
that
it
could
have
meant
the
interpretation
that
you
suggest.
and
we
know
that
because
mills
held
that
and
mckoy
held
that.
so,
of
course,
it
could
have
meant
that.
but
the
fact
that
it
could
have
meant
that
and
was
eventually
held
to
mean
that
over
continuing
dissent
by
the
court
is
not...
does
not
resolve
the
teague
question.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
let
me
speak
first
to
penry.
penry
did
not
involve
this
question
of
unanimity,
and
the
reason
i
believe
that
the
opinion
was
taken
that
it
was
obviously
an
application
of
lockett
is
because
it
involved
very
much
the
same
kind
of
categorical
question
that
was
presented
in
lockett.
in
the
penry
case,
there
were
three
questions
before
the
jury,
three
mitigating
categories
given
to
the
jury.
the
defendant
said,
i
have
some
evidence
that
doesn't
strictly
fall
within
one
of
those
three
categories.
in
lockett,
there
were
three
categories
of
mitigation
given
to
the
sentencer,
and
the
defendant
said,
i
have
some
categories
of
mitigation
that
don't
fall
within
those
three
categories
that
my
sentencer
was
limited
to.
that's
why
penry
is
a
straightforward
lockett
case.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
your
honor,
i--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i
could
be
wrong,
but
i...
i
remember
no
such
statement
from
any
of
the
opinions
in
penry
or
really
in
any
other
case
except
for
the...
the
mills
and
mckoy
cases
where
the
subject
was
in
dispute.
so
that
to
the
extent
it
was
obvious
to
some
members
of
the
court,
it
was
far
from
obvious
to
other
members
of
the
court,
and
therefore
certainly
couldn't
have
been
obvious
to
the
state
court
judges
who
were
expected
to
know
before
either
of
those
cases
were
decided.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
that
is
certainly
our
view,
your
honor,
and
that
is
very
relevant
to
the
second
question
presented
here,
which
is
whether,
even
assuming
that
the
mills
rule
could
be
applied
retroactively,
there
was
a...
an
unreasonable
application
of
that
rule
by
the
state
court.
now,
originally
this
question
came
before
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
1991
in
the
zettlemoyer
case.
it
was
the
same
type
of
instruction
that's
presented
here
that
tracked
the
structure
of
the
pennsylvania
sentencing
statute.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals,
said
that
that
instruction
was
not
inconsistent
with
mills,
and
it
said
it
was
not
inconsistent
with
mills
because
an
instruction
that
requires
unanimity
as
to
aggravation
but
doesn't
mention
unanimity
as
to
mitigation
is
not
an
instruction
that
requires
unanimity
as
to
both.
it's
the
same
theory
that
we
have
been
presenting
in
this
case
all
along.
in
the
next
case
that
came
up
before
the
third
circuit
in
1997
in
frey,
the
third
circuit
held,
no,
that
kind
of
instruction,
with
all
the
words
and
proximities
at
issue
there,
did
violate
mills.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
it's...
it
treated
it
as
distinguishing,
your
honor,
but
that...
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
think
that
that's
irrelevant
for
our
purposes
because
the
frey
case
was
a
pre-aedpa
case,
certainly
wasn't
applying
a
deference
standard.
and
the
frey
case
not
only
wasn't
applying
the
deference
standard,
but
went
so
far
as
to
characterize
the
state
court's
interpretation
of
its
instruction
in
these
capital
cases
as
plausible.
now,
whether
or
not
plausible
means
reasonable--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--excuse
me.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
zettlemoyer
case,
the
first
one
in
1991,
focused
on
both,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
and
the
court
of
appeals...
it
was
faced
with
the...
the...
i
believe
that
the
page
exactly
is
923
f.
2d
at
308.
it's
cited
in
our...
in
our
brief.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
quoted
both
the
charge
and
the
verdict
form,
and
we
would
suggest
that
both
were
legally
parallel
to
the
charge
and
the
form
involved
in
this
case.
and
the
court
made
its
comment
in
regard
to
both
of
those
provisions.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
the
form
refers
to
unanimity
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
the
charge
does,
i
would
submit,
justice
stevens,
because
it
says,
we,
the
jury,
unanimously
sentence
the
defendant
in
the
above
matter,
and
then
you
have
two
options,
just
as
the
statute
in
pennsylvania
and
just
as
the
judge's
charge
laid
out.
we
unanimously
sentence
the
defendant
in
the
above
matter,
and
it
says
to
at
least...
we...
we,
the
jury,
unanimously
sentence
the
defendant
in
the
above
matter
to
death
or
life
imprisonment.
we,
the
jury...
have
you
found
unanimously,
and
then
the
two
options.
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance
and
no
mitigating
circumstance
or...
and
there's
a
big
or
in
the
middle
of
the
verdict
form...
or
one
or
more
aggravating
circumstances
which
outweigh
any
mitigating
circumstances.
so--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
there
are
blanks
next
to
the
mitigating
circumstances,
but
frankly,
we
still
have
those
blanks
next
to
mitigating
circumstances
now
after
mills,
after
it's
been
changed,
in
order
to
make
it
perfectly
explicit
that
any
one
juror
can
vote
for
mitigation.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--your
honor,
two
things.
first
of
all,
the
reason
that
there
are
checks
there
is
that
the
jury,
under
the
pennsylvania
structure,
is
essentially
required
to
give
a
second
look
at
mitigation
in
the
weighing
charge,
even
if
some
of
those
jurors
may
have...
even
if
the
jurors
may
have
been
in
dispute
about
the
existence
of
those
mitigating
circumstances.
so
in
order
to
apply
the
first
phase
of
the
instructions,
they
have
to
decide
whether
all
of
them
find
no
mitigation.
if
all
of
them
don't
find
the
absence
of
mitigation,
then
they
go
to
the
second
stage,
and
at
that
point,
they
are
all
required
to
look
at
mitigation,
even
if
they
might
have
voted
against
it
the
first
time.
so
the
statute
appropriately
tracks
the
kind
of
mitigation
that
all
of
them
are
required
to
consider
in
the
weighing
process.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make,
however,
your
honor,
is
that,
of
course,
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
a
verdict
form
like
this
and
an
instruction
like
this
have
been
looked
at.
and
i
must
emphasize
this
is
a
deference
case
under
section
2254.
as
i
explained,
the
third
circuit
in
1991
looked
at
a
verdict
form
like
this
and
said,
no,
this
is
not
a
violation
of
mills.
other
circuits
around
the
united
states
have
consistently
held
that
this
kind
of
instruction
and
verdict
form
are
not
a
violation
of
mills.
where
the...
where
the
instruction
and
verdict
form
explicitly
require
unanimity
as
to
aggravation
but
don't
explicitly
require
unanimity
as
to
mitigation,
then
there's
no
violation
of
mills.
and
that's--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--justice
breyer,
for
purposes
of
the
second
question
here,
the
deference
question,
our
argument
is
that
that
is
not
the
case,
that
the
jury
here
was
not
permitted
to
vote
for
death
or
not
required
to
vote
for
death
automatically
merely
because
they
were
not
unanimous
in
failing
to
find
a
particular
piece
of
mitigation.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
what
i
would
say,
your
honor,
is
that
before
mills
a
state
that
came
to
that
conclusion
would
not
have
acted
unreasonably
for
purposes
of
the
teague
standard.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
your
honor,
we
think
it
is
a
significant
change
and
that's--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--well,
that's--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--to
the
same
exception.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
yes,
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
answer
to
that
is--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--then
answer
to
that
is,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
a
rule
is
new
enough
to
be
teague-barred
is
hardly
enough
to
make
it...
render
it--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--a
second
teague
exception.
in
fact,
your
honor,
this
court
has
on
numerous
occasions
held
that
rules,
including
lockett-based
rules,
are
not
new,
and
yet
not
a
single
one
of
them
has
been
held
to
be
a
second
exception.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
that
category
is
exceedingly
narrow,
that
such
exceptions
will
be
very
rare,
and
surely
in
every
other
case
where
a...
an
important
lockett-based
rule
has
been
announced
that
has
been
found
new
for
teague
purposes,
the
court
has
gone
on
to
reject
second
exception
status
here.
in
fact,
even
banks
in
his
brief
here
does
not
argue
second
exception
status
for
the
mills
rule.
in
further
comment
on
the
mills
rule,
however,
i
would...
i
would
like
to...
on
the
teague
bar,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
as
i've
mentioned,
that
the
court
has
previously
considered
lockett-based
claims
for
teague
purposes.
in
simmons,
for
example,
and
in
the
caldwell
case,
the
court
established
rules
that
were
explicitly
based
on
lockett
concerning...
concerning
the
jury's
consideration
of
evidence
at
the...
at
a
capital
sentencing
hearing.
and
yet,
in
both
of
those
cases,
even
though
i
would
suggest
they
were
really
smaller
leaps
from
lockett
than
mills
was,
the
court
has
held
that
those
were
new
rules
that
were
not
entitled
either
to
old
rule
status
or
to
second
exception
status.
and
as
in
the
cases
holding
that
simmons
and
caldwell
were
new
rules,
we
believe
the
court
should
hold
that
teague
is
a
new
rule.
now,
to
return
to
the
question...
to
the
deference
question,
which--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
that's
mills
is
a
new
rule.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
thank
you.
to
return
to
the
deference
question,
the
second
question
presented,
as
i
was
saying,
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
state
court's
interpretation,
the
one
that
was
victorious
here
in
state
court,
the
same
interpretation
based
on
the
same
state
court
precedents,
was
plausible.
and
whether
or
not
plausible
means
reasonable,
it
surely
does
not
mean
unreasonable.
and
yet,
in
the
first
post-aedpa
case
involving
mills
that
came
along
in
the
third
circuit,
this
one,
the
third
circuit
held
without
discussion
of
either
its
original
1991
ruling
that
had
upheld
this
charge
or
any
discussion
of
its
1997
ruling
that
had
noted
that
the
contrary
construction
was
not
unreasonable,
the
third
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
no
court
could
reasonably
have
applied
mills
in
the
way
that
the
state
court
did.
and
the...
the
reason
that
all
the
other
circuits
have
disagreed
with
the
third
circuit
on
that
and
that
the
third
circuit
itself
has
come
to
a
different
position
on
that
gets
back
to
mills
itself
because
mills
was
not
the
kind
of
charge
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
in
mills,
the
charge
explicitly
required
the
jury
to
be
unanimous
in
order
to
find
the
presence
of
mitigation.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
the
direct
appeal
in
this
case--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--was
completed,
including
denial
of
certiorari
by
this
court,
before
mills
was
decided.
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
the
mills
case,
the
court
was
faced
with
a
verdict
form
which
explicitly
required
unanimity
to
find...
to
mark
yes
for
mitigation
and
explicitly
required
that
only
those
mitigating
circumstances
marked
yes...
that
is,
unanimously
marked
yes...
could
be
considered
at
the
weighing
stage.
now,
contrast
that
in
both
respects
with
what
happened
here.
there
was
no
instruction
on
unanimity
for
yeses.
there
was
no
instruction
that
only
unanimous
yeses
could
be
weighed.
instead,
we
have
only
an
instruction
requiring
unanimity
for
no
votes
on
mitigation.
and
i
think
that
there's
a
further
important
point
about
the
mills
case.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
if
it
is
susceptible
to
such
a
reading
at
all,
it
is
far
from
the
primary
meaning,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
really
just
the
rules
of
english
grammar.
the
two
stages
of
the
process
that
are
laid
out
in
the
instruction
in
question
are
not
parallel.
they
are
dramatically
different.
so
the
first
stage
says,
you
must
be
unanimous
in
finding
aggravating
circumstances
or
no
mitigating
circumstances.
and
there's
no
question,
as
a
matter
of
grammar,
that
there's
only
one
verb
in
that
sentence
with
two
objects,
aggravating
circumstances
and
no
mitigating
circumstances.
the
verb,
unanimously
finds,
must
apply
to
both
nouns.
in
the
second
sentence,
we
have
a
different
structure.
unanimously
find--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--well,
your
honor,
had
the
mills
rule
already
been
decided,
i
think
somebody
might
have
raised
an
objection.
it
may
or
may
not
have
succeeded
but
certainly
had
an
objection
been
able
to
be
made
contemporaneously,
we
wouldn't
have
to
have
worried
about
error
being
built
into
the
trial
and
the
matter
could
have
been
handled
expeditiously.
that's
why
we
have
changed
our
verdict
form,
not
because
pennsylvania
has
changed
its
understanding
of
what
has
always
been
the
structure
of
its
sentencing
process,
but
because
once
mills
was
decided,
once
the
matter
was
constitutionalized,
it
became
certainly
wise
for
the
court
to
attempt
to
avoid
further
litigation
on
the
question
by
making
it
explicit.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
our...
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
the
fact
that
they
changed
the
form
in
response
to
a
new
rule
is
not
evidence
that
they
previously
read
their
statute
in
a
different
way.
in
fact,
the
state
supreme
court
has
always
said
that
it
has
always
read
the
statute
to
require
unanimity
only
as
to
the
absence,
to
the
rejection
of
mitigation
and
not
to
the
finding
of
any
particular
mitigation.
but
in
reference
to
your
question
concerning
arguments
of
counsel,
in
fact,
there
was
no
argument
of
counsel
from
either
side
here
that
the
jury
had
to
be
unanimous
about
mitigation.
in
the
same
manner
that
your
honor
has
suggested,
presumably
the
prosecutor,
had
he
believed
that
the
jury
had
to
be
unanimous
about
mitigation,
it
would
have
been
to
his
advantage
to
say
so
and
to
argue
to
the
jury,
all
12
of
you
have
to
find
these
before
you
can
consider
them.
he
didn't
say
anything
like
that.
and
in
fact,
here's
what
the
defense
lawyer
said
in
volume
6
of
the
trial
transcript
at
pages
2300
and
2301.
he
wasn't,
i
believe,
specifically
referring
to
mitigation,
but
he
said,
quote,
think
individually,
decide
this
individually.
all
it
takes
is
one
person
to
save
his
life.
now,
in
light
of
the
manner
in
which
the
case
was
argued
to
the
jury
and
in
light
of
the
manner
in
which
the
judge
presented
the
charge
and
laid
out
the
verdict
form,
we
believe
that
the
jury
would
not
have...
cannot
be
assumed
to
have
come
to
the
wrong
conclusion
here,
and
surely
that
the
state
court
and,
as
i've
mentioned,
every
federal
circuit
court
looking
at
similar
instructions
and
verdict
forms,
could
not
be
said
to
have
acted
unreasonably
in
finding
the
absence
of
a
mills
violation.
thank
you.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
now
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
to
the
last
point
concerning
finality,
your
honor,
and
the
argument
that
the...
pennsylvania
has
created
a
unique
form
of
collateral
review,
which
is
really
just
direct
review,
that
would
be
news
to
the
state
supreme
court
which
declared
this
very
case
to
have
become
final
at
the
conclusion
of
direct
appeal
in
1987.
moreover,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
on
numerous
occasions
applied
the
teague
rule
in
cases
arising
on
collateral
review
to
hold
that
the
claim
at
issue
was
a
new
rule.
obviously
they
couldn't
have
done
that
if
they
didn't
think
that
their
own
collateral
review
occurred
after
the
point
of
finality.
and...
and
furthermore,
in...
in
response
to
the
argument
that
this
court
may
not
have
been
fully
aware
of
the
supposedly
unique
nature
of
pennsylvania's
procedure,
mr.
flora
made
exactly
that
argument
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari
that
preceded
this
court's
previous
summary
disposition
in
this
case.
concerning
the
general
argument
that
lockett
is
not
a
new
rule
because
it
forbids
any
barrier
to
the
consideration
of
mitigation,
of
course
the
whole
question
of
what's
a
barrier
that
qualifies
for
lockett
protection
or
not...
and
that
question
has
by
no
means
been
clear,
as
i
mentioned.
that
was
the
exact
argument
that
was
at
issue
in
walton,
and
the
majority
of
the
court
held
that
to
the
extent
the
preponderance
standard
is
a
barrier,
it's
an
acceptable
barrier.
but,
of
course,
even
in
those
cases
where
the
court
has
held
that
lockett
applies,
to
create
a
rule
against
a
barrier
to
consideration
such
as
simmons
and
such
as
caldwell,
the
court
has,
nonetheless,
held
that
that
rule
is
new.
saffle
is
certainly
additional
support
for
that
proposition,
although
in
saffle
the
court
declined
to
create
a
rule.
in
simmons
and
caldwell,
the
court
did
find
that
the
rule
was
required
by
lockett,
and
yet
in
later
cases
found
that
the
rule
was
new.
now,
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
that
the
alternative
view
or
the...
the
failure
to
see
lockett
immediately
as
a
case
that
precluded
unanimity
is
because
we
must
consider
what
the
nature
of
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances
is,
your
honor.
it's
not
merely
a
fact
finding.
it
is
really
a
mixed
question
of
law,
in
fact.
the
jury
is
not
required
to
find
fact
a,
fact
b,
or
fact
c.
it
is
required
to
find
a
mitigating
circumstance.
and
given
that
that
is
the
nature
of
mitigating
circumstances,
it
was
all
the
more
reasonable
for
the
states
not
to
understand
lockett
as
precluding
unanimity
for
the
purposes
of
making
that
mixed
fact...
mixed
fact
and
law
determination
at
the
mitigating
stage.
but
in
any
case,
as
i've
said,
given
the
dispute
even
on
this
court,
it
was
certainly
reasonable
for
the...
for
the
state
courts
not
to
know.
and
given
the
dispute
among
the
other
courts
about
the...
the
nature
of
the
application
of
the
mills
rule
to
verdict
forms
and
instructions
like
this
one,
it
was
certainly
reasonable
for
the
state
courts
to--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--but,
your
honor,
those--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--those
difficult
mixed
questions
are
exactly
the
kinds
of
questions
that
we
always
ask
juries
to
decide
and
in
every
context
outside
of
this
one,
to
decide
unanimously,
even
for
example,
not
just
in
the
case
of
the
commonwealth
meeting
its
burden
of
proof,
but
the
defendant
meeting
his
burden
of
proof
where
that
burden
of
proof
is
on
him
in
the
situation
of
a...
of
an
affirmative
defense.
of
course,
my
argument
is
not
that
lockett
can't
possibly
be
read
to
require
the
result
that
you
suggest.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
