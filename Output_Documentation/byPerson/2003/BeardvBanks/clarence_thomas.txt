justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
more
than
20
years
ago
a
jury
convicted
respondent,
george
e.
banks
of
12
counts
of
first
degree
murder,
and
the
trial
court
sentenced
him
to
death.
respondent’s
conviction
became
final
in
october
1987
roughly
eight
months
before,
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
mills
v.
maryland.
in
mills
and
mckoy
versus
north
carolina,
this
court
held
invalid
capital
sentencing
schemes
that
require
juries
to
disregard
mitigating
factors
not
found
unanimously.
respondent
pursued
state
postconviction
relieve
on
the
theory
that
the
instructions
and
verdict
form
given
to
the
jury
in
this
case
violated
the
mills’
principle.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
rejected
this
claim
on
the
merits.
respondent
then
turned
to
the
federal
courts
pressing
the
same
theory.
the
district
court
denied
relief
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
we
summarily
reversed
the
court
of
appeals’
holding
however,
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
the
retroactivity
analysis
set
forth
in
teague
v.
lane.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
mills
was
not
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
criminal
procedure
at
the
time
respondent’s
conviction
became
final.
the
court
of
appeals
then
reinstated
the
remainder
of
its
previous
opinion
and
again
granted
respondent
relief
from
his
death
sentence.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
teague
the
determination
whether
a
constitutional
rule
of
criminal
procedure
applies
to
a
case
on
collateral
review
involves
a
three-step
process.
first,
the
court
must
determine
when
the
defendant’s
conviction
became
final;
second,
the
court
must
ascertain
the
legal
landscape
as
at
then
existed
and
ask
whether
the
constitution
as
interpreted
by
that
precedent
compels
the
rule,
that
is
the
court
must
decide
whether
the
rule
is
actually
new;
finally,
if
the
rule
is
new,
the
court
must
consider
whether
it
falls
within
either
of
two
exemptions
to
non-retroactivity.
we
conclude
that
respondent’s
conviction
became
final
in
1987.
the
legal
landscape
as
of
that
time
consisted
of
lockett
versus
ohio,
eddings
versus
oklahoma,
and
related
cases.
these
cases
held
that
the
sentencer
could
not
be
precluded
from
considering
mitigating
evidence.
the
court
in
mills
focused
for
the
first
time
on
individual
jurors
rather
that
the
sentencer
as
a
unit.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
reasonable
jurors
could
have
differed
as
to
whether
the
lockett
principle
compelled
mills.
mills
broke
new
ground
and
the
mills
rule
is
therefore,
new.
neither
of
teague's
exceptions
apply
here.
the
second
exception,
the
only
one
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
for
watershed
rules
of
criminal
procedure
implicating
the
fundamental
fairness
and
accuracy
of
criminal
proceeding.
we
have
repeatedly
emphasized
the
limited
scope
of
this
exception,
explaining
that
it
is
clearly
meant
to
apply
only
to
a
small
core
of
rules
requiring
observance
of
those
procedures
that
are
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty.
in
providing
guidance
as
to
what
might
fall
within
this
exception,
we
have
referred
to
the
rule
of
gideon
v.
wainwright
right
to
counsel
and
only
this
rule.
by
contrast,
we
have
not
hesitated
to
hold
that
less
sweeping
in
fundamental
rules
do
not
fall
within
teague's
second
exception.
we
have
recognized
that
avoidance
of
potentially
arbitrary
impositions
of
the
death
sentences
motivated
the
court
in
mills
and
mckoy.
but
because
all
of
our
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
concerning
capital
sentencing
is
directed
toward
the
enhancement
of
reliability
and
accuracy
in
some
sense,
the
fact
that
a
new
rule
removes
some
remote
possibility
of
arbitrary
infliction
of
the
death
sentence
does
not
suffice
to
bring
it
within
teague's
second
exception.
the
mills
rule
has
none
of
the
primacy
and
centrality
of
the
rule
adopted
in
gideon.
the
rule
applies
narrowly
and
works
no
fundamental
shift
in
our
understanding
of
the
bedrock
procedural
element
essential
to
fundamental
fairness.
we
conclude
that
the
mills
rule
does
not
fall
within
the
second
teague
exemption.
