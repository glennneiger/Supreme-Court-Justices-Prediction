justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
with
lockett...
with
lockett
they...
what
lockett
says
is
that
the
sentencer
cannot
be
precluded
from
considering
as
a
mitigating
factor
any
aspect
of
the
defendant's
character
or
record
or
any
circumstance.
now,
one
thing
that
could
have
meant...
one
thing...
is
that
you
cannot
execute
a
person
unless
12
people
think
that
not
only
that
crime
is
unusually
terrible...
that's
aggravating...
but
also
that
it
outweighs
in
this
person's
life
any
good
things
he
wants
to
bring
in.
that's
his
character.
and
12
people
have
to
come
to
that
ultimate
judgment.
now,
if
that's
so,
12
people
have
to
come
to
that
ultimate
judgment,
12
people
have
not
come
to
that
ultimate
judgment
when
in
fact
11
would
let
him
off,
but
one
blocks
it
by
saying
i
don't
agree
that
this
is
the
mitigating
circumstance.
so
if
that's
what
lockett
means,
it
would
be
obvious
that
that
wouldn't
satisfy
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
else
could
lockett
mean
is
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
else
could
lockett
mean
that
would
make
sense
in
the
context
of
the
death
penalty?
and
you'll
have
a
lot
of
answers,
but
i
want
to
know
what
they
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't,
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
precisely
in
a
reasonable
way...
and
i'm
going
to
wonder
if
that's...
if
it
is
reasonable
or
not.
that's
going
to
be
the
issue...
what
other
thing
it
might
have
meant.
and
i...
i'll
draw
here
on
the
concurrence
in
penry
where
the
statement
is
made
it's
obvious
it's
meant
what
i
just
said
it
meant
because
anything
else
would
have
been
arbitrary
in
the
context
of
our
arbitrariness
jurisprudence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
you
tell
me...
i
understand
the
words,
well,
historical,
et
cetera,
but
i
want
to
pin
you
down
more
than
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
thinking
of
penry's
commentary
about
mills
or
whatever.
i
may...
i
may
get
these
cases
mixed
up,
but
i
thought
that
mills
was
characterized
as
a
case
that
follows
obviously--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--from
lockett--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so...
so
if
in
fact
we
have
12
jurors
and
all
12
believe
that
this
person
was
awarded
the
congressional
medal
of
honor
and
11
of
them
think
that
means
he
shouldn't
get
death,
but
one
of
them
thinks
it
isn't
that
much
of
an
offsetting
factor,
on
your
reading
of
this,
the...
they
could
conclude
after
lockett
that
it's
death
because
we
don't
have
unanimity
on
whether
that
congressional
medal
offsets
the
horrible
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
they
had
been...
because
let's...
i...
i
was
reading
the
jury
form
differently,
and
i
might
be
wrong.
i'll
go
back
to
that.
but
take
my
hypothetical
and
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
retroactivity
question.
and
on
that,
you're
thinking,
well,
before
mills
a
state
that
came
to
that
conclusion
would
not
be
violating
the
constitution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
now,
suppose
in
mills...
suppose
you're
right.
and
now
in
mills
you
would
say,
well,
that's
not
right,
and
the
reason
that's
not
right
is
because
the
role
of
the
juror
is
not
simply
to
find
the
facts,
but
also
to
weigh
the
significance
of
the
mitigating
fact
against
the
horror
of
the
crime.
that's
what
mills
then
on
that
view
would
have
said.
well,
why
isn't
that
terribly
important?
i.e.,
that
is
a
radical
shift
in
the
role
of
the
juror
from
what
was
previously
viewed
as
simply
finding
facts,
now
to
a
person
who
is
going
to
make
the
ultimate
weighing
question
in
his
own
mind
in
respect
to
life
and
death
and
the
person's
career.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
amazingly
enough
to
fall
within
in...
you
see
where
i'm
going?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm...
i'm
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
watershed
rule.
is
it
a
watershed
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
is
a
watershed
rule,
then
of
course
it's
retroactive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
it's
not
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
now
what
are
you...
what
do
you
say
to
a
different
reading
of
lockett,
which
would
be
the
following?
a
state
official
reads
lockett
and
says,
this
is
how
it's
supposed
to
work,
that
the
defendant
can
introduce
evidence
on
anything
he
wants
and
the
jurors
can
consider
any
of
this
mitigating
evidence,
and
they
do
consider
it.
but
when
it
comes
time
to
vote,
the
only
things
that
the
jurors
can
use
to
offset
the
aggravating
factors
are
mitigating
aspects
of
the
defendant's
life,
that
they
unanimously
agree
are,
one,
in
existence
and,
two,
are
mitigating.
they
look
at
lockett
and
say,
of
course,
the
jurors
considered
everything.
now...
now
it
comes
time
to
vote,
and
at
this
point
these
are
the
rules
in
our
state.
now,
what
i
think
is
the
hardest
for
you
is,
while
that
might
not
be
the
best
reading
of
lockett
and
it
certainly
doesn't
prove
to
have
been
the
true
reading
of
lockett
after
mills,
can
we
say
it's
an
unreasonable
reading
of
lockett?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
is...
the
point
i
was
thinking
before
and
i'd...
it
was
justice
kennedy
actually.
i
think
when
he...
he
wrote
in
concurrence.
it
is
apparent
the
result
in
mills
fits
within
our
line
of
cases
forbidding
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
on
the
basis
of
caprice
in
an
arbitrary
and
unpredictable
fashion
or
through
arbitrary
or
freakish
means.
that's
franklin
and
california
v.
brown
and
furman
and
so
forth.
all
right.
think
back
to
what
my...
my
effort
to
characterize
a
reasonable
state
interpretation
of
lockett
different
from
yours.
well,
can
you
say
why
would
that
be
in
your
opinion,
the
state
saying
they
consider
everything?
you
remember
what
it
was.
right?
why
would
that
be
freakish
or
arbitrary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
a
different
question.
is
the
jury
form
in
the
record...
do
we
have
it?
i'm...
i'm
looking
at
pages
66,
67,
and
68
of
the
appendix
where...
of
the
joint
appendix
where
you
have
the
form.
and
i'm
trying
to
work
out
whether
this
is
or
is
not
ambiguous.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
might
depend
on
the
way
in
which
it
appeared
on
the
page
because
you
see
the
word
unanimously
appears
over
here
in
question
2
on
page
66,
and
depending
on
how
this
is
indented,
it
might
be
whether
the
jury
would
reasonably
think
that
that
word
unanimously
does
or
does
not
apply
to
the
questions
that
are
on
page
68.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
form
itself
is...
it's
indented.
if
it
were
indented,
it
would
seem
that
the
unanimously
would
govern
what
follows
thereafter,
but
if
it's
not
indented,
it
seems
to
me
a
judge
might
reasonably
think
that
that
word
unanimously
didn't
govern
what...
what
follows
thereafter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
not
indented,
then...
and
this
is
the
other
part
of
the
case.
see,
if...
if
it's
not
indented,
then
you
look
at
the
instruction
and
in
the
instruction
itself,
nowhere
does
the
judge
say
anything
about
having
to
find
the...
the
mitigating
factors
unanimously.
he
doesn't
say
that.
and
then
you
look
at
the
jury
form
and
again,
if
it's
not
indented,
it
really
doesn't
seem
to
say
that
they
have
to
find
this
unanimously
because
the
word
unanimously
seems
to
apply
here
on
the
page
to
the
first
three
things
that
are
blank.
and
then
we
get
a
new
section.
in
the
new
section
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
unanimous.
so...
so
that
was
what
i
want
you
to
reply
to
because
the
question
is
whether
a
judge
in
that
state
court
could
reasonably
have
taken
this
form
and
the
instructions
and
said,
well,
it...
it
doesn't
say
they
have
to
be
unanimous.
they
wouldn't
have
thought
they
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
of
those
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
if
a
judge...
if
a
judge
in
the
state
says,
well,
i
think
it
didn't,
what
would
you
point
to
in
reply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
this
mixed
question
of
fact
of
law
that
i
think
makes
it
more
difficult
for
you
in
the
sense
that
if
it's
a
mixed
question,
it's
really
asking
the
jurors
to
decide
should
this
person
die,
does
he
deserve
to
die.
and
then
the
pre-mills
statute
in
the
state
becomes
a
situation
where
he
will
die
even
though
11
jurors
think
he
shouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that...
that--
