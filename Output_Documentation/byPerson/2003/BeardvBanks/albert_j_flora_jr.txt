mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
lockett
and
eddings
established
a
fundamental
principle
which
basically
provides
that
a
state
which
creates
any
barrier
which
precludes
a
sentencer
from
giving
full
consideration
and
full
effect
to
mitigating
evidence
relating
to
a
person's
character,
background,
and
circumstances
of
the
offense
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
when
we
look
at
mills
and
take
into
account
the
decision
in
mckoy,
the
unanimity
instruction
in
mills,
in
a
weighing
state
such
as
pennsylvania,
essentially
was
a
different
type
of
barrier
which
precluded
jurors
to
give
effect
to
mitigating
evidence.
in
a
non-weighing
state,
the
unanimity
requirement
would
probably
be
appropriate,
but
in
a
weighing
state,
what
happens
is
a
single
juror
can
say
to
other
11
jurors,
i
don't
believe
that
this
particular
piece
of
evidence
satisfies
a
mitigating
circumstance,
and
that
single
juror
can
preclude
those
other
11
jurors
from
giving
effect.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
when
you
look
back
at
the
legal
landscape
over
a
period
of
time,
going
back
from
hitchcock,
to
skipper,
to
eddings,
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
court
dealt
with
different
types
of
barriers.
the
court
dealt
with
different
pieces
of
factual
evidence
relating
to
character
and
background
and
circumstances
of
the
offense.
when
the
lockett
rule
was
initially
announced
by
a
plurality
of
the
court,
the
court
could
not
perceive
in
the
future
every
different
type
of
barrier
that
may
come
about,
and
so
what
happened
over
a
period
of
time,
when
you
took
the
lockett
rule,
you
were
essentially
applying
it
to
a
variety
of
factual
different
situations,
and
each
time
the
court
would
look
at
a
particular
barrier,
which
it
had
not
perceived
in
the
past,
and
if
it
precluded
a
juror
or
a
jury
from
giving
effect
to
mitigating
evidence,
it
struck
down
that
barrier.
and
that's
where
we're
coming
from
here.
so
when
we
say
that
it
is
a
stretch
of
lockett,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
it
is
a
logical
consequence
of
lockett.
i
think
it
is
dictated
by
lockett
and
the
cases
that
followed
after
that.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
if
we
look
at
mills
and
if
we
look
at
the
dissent,
in
looking
at
the
dissent,
my
interpretation
was
that
the
issue
was
over
how
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
interpreted
the
particular
instructions
in
that
case.
i
did
not
glean
from
the
dissent
that
they
thought
a
unanimity
requirement
would
not
constitute
a
barrier
to
a
jury
or
jurors
giving
effect
to
mitigating
evidence.
if
you
look
at
mckoy...
and
i
think
this
is
a
question
that
justice
breyer
had
posed
about
a
case...
in
mckoy
at
494
u.s.
at
438,
the
court
says
in
the
majority
opinion,
we
reason
that
allowing
a
hold-out
juror
to
prevent
the
other
jurors
from
considering
mitigating
evidence
violated
the
principle
established
in
lockett
v.
ohio,
that
a
sentencer
may
not
be
precluded
from
giving
effect
to
all
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i...
i
would
agree
to
a
point.
if
we
look
at
lockett,
lockett
did
not
say
that
an
evidentiary
ruling
which
precluded
the
consideration
or
giving
effect
to
mitigating
evidence
was
constitutionally
prohibited.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
when
you
look
back
at
lockett,
at
the
time
lockett
was
decided,
i
don't
think
the
court
could...
could
envision
the
various
types
of
barriers
that
a
state
could
create
which
would
preclude
a
sentencer
from
giving
effect
to
mitigating
evidence.
so
each
time
a
barrier
came
up,
whether
it
was
in
eddings
or
skipper
or
hitchcock--
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
--the
way
i
describe
mills
is
essentially
again
that
in
order
to
give
effect
to
mitigating
evidence,
you
simply
cannot
have
a
requirement
which
allows
one
juror
to
preclude
the
other
11
from
giving
that
effect.
and
it's
my
position
that
that
is...
that
concept
is
dictated
by
the
lockett
rule.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
there
is
language
as
to
whether
if
there
is
a
reasonable
debate
amongst
the
minds
of
the
jurors.
the
problem
with
that
concept,
when
you
look
at
the
history
of
capital
jurisprudence
since
furman
on
forward,
i
can
only
think
of
probably
two
cases
in
which
this
court
has
been
unanimous
in
its
decision,
one
of
which
was
hitchcock
v.
dugger.
if
we
say
that
the
rule
upon
which
a
defendant
seeks
to
rely
is
a
new
rule,
if
so
much
as
one
justice
disagrees,
i
don't
think
we
could
ever
have
then
a
rule
that
would
be
based
on
precedents.
that's
the
problem
i
have.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
can
honestly
quantitate
it...
put
a
quantitative
amount
to
it.
i
just
think
that--
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
--i
think...
that's
a
tough
question.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
that
is
what
was
said
in
mckoy
by
the
dissenters,
but
the
majority
in
mckoy
disagreed
with
that.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
a
judge
could
not
say
in
light
of
mills.
i
think,
however--
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
--especially
in
a
weighing
state
because
you're
talking
about
unanimously
find
aggravating
circumstances.
then
you
also
used
the
phrase
unanimously
find
mitigating
circumstances,
and
that's
the
problem
that
i
have.
i
think
clearly
a
court
can
give
guidance
to
a
jury
in
the
consideration
and
weighing
of
evidence,
and
quite
frankly,
that
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
if
you
tell
the
jury
to
try
to
unanimously
find
all
of
the
mitigating
factors,
the
problem
i
see
with
that
is
what
happens
if
they
don't.
in
pennsylvania
there
is
no
remedy
if
there
is
a
deadlock
on
the
finding
of
a
mitigating
factor.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
it
was
an
understanding
of
the
way
the
jury
functions
pre-mills.
i
would
agree
there,
but
in
the
penalty
phase,
in
taking
a
look
at
the
way
the
unanimity
requirement
would
operate
in
that
phase,
it
is
very
different--
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
--well,
when
i
think
of
a
unanimity
requirement
in
a
non-capital
setting,
if
one
juror
holds
out,
that
juror
cannot
force
a
guilty
verdict.
in
a
capital
case,
if
one
juror
holds
out
and
precludes
the
other
11
from
giving
effect
to
mitigating
evidence,
that
one
juror
essentially
can
effect
a
sentence
of
death.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
i
think
we
can.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
i
think
we
can
because
merely
giving
consideration
to
mitigating
evidence
would,
i
think,
also
necessitate
the
ability
to
give
effect
to
that
evidence,
and
i
think
that's
what's
essential.
if
we're
left
with
the
fact--
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
--in
saffle,
you
were
dealing
with
an
anti-sympathy
instruction.
sympathy
in
and
of
itself
is
a
concept,
but
it's
not
evidence
of
character.
it's
not
evidence
of
background.
it's
not
evidence
of
the
circumstances
of
a
crime.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
is
a
concept.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
when
you
introduce
sympathy,
as
the
attempt
was
to
be
done
in
saffle,
that
by
doing
that
you're
bringing
into
the
picture
something
that
is
totally
irrelevant
and
from
which
a
jury
would
not
be
able
to
make
a
reasoned
moral
inquiry
into
the
culpability
of
the
defendant
to
determine
whether
a
sentence
of
death
or
life
should
be
imposed.
so
when
i
look
at
saffle
and
i
look
at
what
saffle
was
attempting
to
do,
i
think
that's
very
different
than
having
a
barrier
which
precludes
giving
effect
to
character
evidence
and
background
evidence
and
evidence
specifically
relating
to
the
circumstances
of
an
offense.
i
see
it
as
being
very
different
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
it
would
be
freakish
or
arbitrary
again
i
think
because
mere
consideration
of
evidence
by
a
jury
is
not
enough.
i
think
you
have
to
give
that
evidence
effect.
without
giving
that
evidence
effect,
i
think
you
can
end
up
with
an
arbitrary
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
i
think
that
it
still
comes
back
to
how
the
unanimity
requirement
operates.
and
the
mechanism
that's
being
utilized
in
employing
that
unanimity
requirement
is
the
actual
juror,
and
if
that
juror
is
again
i
think
a
lone,
hold-out
vote,
then
i
think
under
the
circumstances
that
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
lockett
rule.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
it's
improperly
indented.
when
you
go
back
and
i
think
you
could
actually
look
at
the...
at
the
jury--
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
--when
you
have
we,
the
jury,
have
found
unanimously,
my
recollection
of
the
form
was
that
it
is
actually
not
indented
like
that.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
my
understanding
of
the
verdict
form
when
it
was
developed
was
that
we,
the
jury,
have
found
unanimously
basically
applies
to
all
of
the
check-off
items.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
the
only
thing
that
i
could
point
to
is
the
actual
verdict
form
itself.
that's
all
i
could
point
to.
i'd
like
to
go
back
a
minute
on
the...
the
question
on
the
jury
question...
or
the
jury
instructions.
jury
instructions
in
capital
cases
to
begin
with
are
very
difficult
to
get
across
to
jurors.
just
traditionally
we've
had
a
tough
time.
when
you
look
at
a
case
like
this
and
you
have
the
jury
going
through
the
guilt
phase
of
the
case,
that
jury
is
already
conditioned
to
a
unanimity
requirement
in
finding
guilt.
when
you
then
carry
them
over
to
a
penalty
phase
and
you
take
the
instruction
that
we
have
here
and
you
give
that
instruction
to
them,
given
the
fact
it's
the
way
they've
already
been
conditioned
and
listening
to
that
instruction
and
hearing
the
word
unanimously
repeated
and
repeated,
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
that
the
jury
would
interpret
that
instruction
as
requiring
unanimity
both
as
to
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
instruction.
and
then
when
you
take
the
verdict
slip
and
put
that
on
top
of
it,
i
think
that
compounds
everything
under
the
circumstances.
and
that's
the
problem
here.
when
we...
staying
with
this,
when
the
state
supreme
court
looked
at
the
mills
issue...
and
they
decided
mills
on
the
merits
in
1995.
it
was
not
decided
during
the
direct
review
process.
pennsylvania
has
a
very
unique
procedure
dealing
with
finality
in
capital
cases.
in
1995
when
the
state
supreme
court
applied
mills
on
the
merits,
what
they
simply
did
was
they
said,
we
interpret
our
statute
as
not
requiring
unanimity.
they
looked
at
only
a
portion
of
the
instruction,
i
believe
approximately
three
sentences,
and
they
say,
the
instruction
tracks
the
language
of
our
statute
and
therefore
there
is
no
violation
of
mills.
i
suggest
that's
an
unreasonable
application
because
what
they
didn't
do
is
apply
the
correct
standard
in--
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
but
in
1995,
when
the
case
was
decided,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
had
the
benefit
of
mills.
and
that's
what's
different
about
this
case.
pennsylvania
has
a
very
different
and
unique
procedure
which
essentially
leaves
open
the
direct
review
process
because
in
capital
proceedings
in
pennsylvania
prior
to
1996,
the
state
court
on
collateral
review
would
apply
any
existing
constitutional
precedents
to
a
claim,
even
though
it
was
not
considered
first
on
direct
review
and
even
though
the
decision
came
up
or
was
decided
by
this
court
after
the
direct
review
process.
it's
a
very
different
concept
there.
so
there's
a
question
here
as
to
when
finality
i
think
occurred.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
and
i
understand
that,
and
when
you
sent
it
back,
one
of
the
questions
we
had
in
our
own
mind
is
whether
in
fact
this
court
was
fully
aware
of
pennsylvania's
unique
process
dealing
with
finality
in
capital
cases.
in
looking
at
teague,
one
of
the
very
first
things
you
have
to
do
is
determine
when
the
judgment
is
final.
teague
itself
speaks
in
terms
of
conventional
notions
of
finality,
but
that
doesn't
mean
a
state
can't
develop
its
own
concept
of
finality
to
which
the
federal
courts
should
give
respect.
after
all,
states
have
the
primary
responsibility
for
establishing
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
protecting
the
rights
of
an
accused.
with
that
in
mind,
concepts
of
federalism
and
comity
which
underline
the
basic
precepts
of
teague
are
not
offended
if
a
state
court
decides
to
keep
open
its
direct
review
process
and
on
collateral
review
say,
look,
here's
a
decision
that
came
down
from
the
united
states
supreme
court.
we
are
going
to
apply
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case
because
we
want
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
execution
of
an
individual
is
beyond
constitutional
reproach.
mr.
albert
j.
flora,
jr.
i
think
the
states
have
a
right
to
do
that.
may
i
finish
the
question?
