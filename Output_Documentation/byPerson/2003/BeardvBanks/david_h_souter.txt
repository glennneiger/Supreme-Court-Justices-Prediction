no,
but
the
question
is
how
you
give
it
effect.
eddings
and
lockett
said
you
cannot
preclude
the
jury,
all
12
people,
categorically
from
giving
a
certain
kind
of
mitigating
evidence
any
consideration.
the
question
in
mills
was
can
you
preclude
one
juror
from
giving
dispositive
effect
to
an
item
of
evidence
in
such
a
way
as
to
determine
the
verdict.
those
are
two
very
different
questions.
they
can
be
placed
under
the
umbrella
of
what
effect
must
jurors
be
allowed
to
give
to
mitigating
evidence,
but
they
are
very
different
questions
within
that
umbrella.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
because
the
questions
are
different,
there
is
not
something
irrational
or
capricious
in
someone
having
a
question...
in
someone
being
uncertain
of
the
answer
to
the
second
question
even
though
the
first
question
has
been
answered
in
favor
of
admissibility.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
