justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
eisenberg,
you
would
concede
that
those...
those
questions
are...
are
certainly
ambiguous.
the...
pennsylvania
made
the
change
just
to
clarify
that
it
was
the
individual
juror
and
not
the...
the
group.
you
can
look
at
those
and
conclude
that
just
like
you
had
to
find
the
aggravated
unanimously,
so
you
had
to
find
each
mitigating
unanimously.
the
form
is
certainly
susceptible
to
that
reading.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
eisenberg,
if
you...
if
you
were...
if
you
were
a...
a
defense
lawyer
and
you
knew
that
the...
the
law
was
that
each
juror
could
individually
decide
the
mitigators
and
you
were
confronted
with
a
form
like
this,
would
you
object?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
it
was
just
the
law
and
not
constitutional,
it
was
all
right
to
be...
to
be
ambiguous,
but
once
it
was
constitutional,
it
had
to
be
clear?
i'm
not
following.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
might
have
been,
mr....
mr.
flora,
the
logical
extension
of
lockett,
but
to
say
that
lockett
itself
compelled
or
directed
that
extension
i
think
is
quite
a
stretch.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it...
does
it
mean
nothing
that
this
court
was
so
sharply
divided
and
that
you
really
have
just
an
opinion?
the
lead
opinion
is
labeled
opinion
of
the
court,
but
justice
white
disassociated
himself
from
the
reading.
he...
he
had
a
much
narrower
view
of
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there's
doubt
about
that,
i
mean,
one
might
say
you
would
prevail
on
that
argument
in
a
debate,
but
teague
requires
more,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
make
any
difference
if
it's
four
justices,
as
it
was
in
mckoy,
do
you
think?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
make
any
difference
that
the
dissenters
say
lockett
didn't
remotely
support
the
rule
that
a
mitigator
found
by
only
one
juror
controls?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
is
what...
what
was
said
in
mckoy
by
the
dissenters.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
that
undercut
this
court's
remand
the
first
time
around?
i
mean,
if
it
were...
if
it
was
still
on
direct
review,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
about
applying
teague
and
yet
we
sent
it
back.
