justice
stevens
on...
on
the
instructions
in
the
red
brief
at
page
8
and
then
at
page
9,
there
are
two
different
instructions
set
out.
this
is
in
the
respondent's
brief.
and
then
the
jury
form
which
has
to
be
checked
is
set
out
on
pages
9
and
10.
in
your
view
is
that
all
we
should
consider
when
we
interpret
these
instructions,
or
do
you
have
some
additional
instructions
that
you
wish
us
to
refer
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
interrupt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
just
one
question?
because
i'm...
i'm
a
little
rusty
on
just
what
the
sequence
of
opinions
was.
and
i...
i
think
you
have
one
impression
of
the
case
if
you
just
read
the
instructions
because
i
think
you've
got
a
very
strong
argument
on
the
instructions.
i
get
a
different
impression
of
the
case
when
i
look
at
the
jury
form,
the
verdict
form,
which
in
effect
requires
a
check
to
show
the
jury
acting
unanimously.
and
my
question
is
at
the
first
go-round,
did
the
court
of
appeals
actually
focus
on
the...
the
jury
form
as
well
as
the
instructions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
jury
form
does
seem
to
imply
a
concept
of
unanimity
because
they
got
to
require...
you
know,
the
form
definitely
refers
to
unanimity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but...
but
the
key
point
is
that
in
the
mitigating
circumstances
are,
there
are
one,
two,
three
options.
they
just
checked
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
see,
it
isn't
explicit
here,
and
the
check
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
they
were
unanimous
on
mitigating
circumstance
number
1,
but
they
were
not
on
the
others.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
it
seems
very
likely
that
some
of
the
jurors
may
have
considered...
felt
they
could
not
consider
mitigating
circumstance
2
or
3.
