justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
compact
covers
withdrawals
of
water
by
virginia?
i
mean,
does
it
directly
cover
that
at
all?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
maryland
could
reject
every
effort
by
virginia
to
withdraw
water
from
the
river?
justice
o'connor
what
is
your
position
then?
justice
o'connor
which
includes
the
right
to
use
some
of
the
water.
justice
o'connor
and
take
it
out
of
the
river.
justice
o'connor
but
only
with
your
permission.
it's
only
the
last
step
that's
the
problem.
[laughter]
is
that
right?
only
with
maryland's
permission--
justice
o'connor
on
the
amount,
but
it
acknowledges--
justice
o'connor
--that
water
can
and
will
be
removed
by
fairfax
county?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
it
said,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
that
virginia
was
given
a
proprietary
right
and
a
privilege
to
erect
any
structures
necessary
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
virginia's
riparian
ownership,
which
presumably
encompasses
taking
out
water.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
do
you
deny
that
virginia
has
riparian
ownership
up
to
the
low-water
mark
of
the
potomac?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
it
says
here
in
the
black-jenkins
award
and
in
the
earlier
compact,
the
privilege
to
erect
structures
necessary
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
riparian
ownership.
that
might
mean
a
pipe
to
take
water
out.
justice
o'connor
what's
left
of
the
dispute
now?
is...
does
virginia
now
have
a
permit
to
withdraw
the
water?
justice
o'connor
yes.
is
that
all
you're
arguing
about?
justice
o'connor
so
we're...
we're
talking
now
about
a
flow
restrictor
in
the
pipe?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
what
it
comes
down
to.
justice
o'connor
all
right.
let--
--what
about
a
citizen
of
virginia
who
owns
property
on
the...
up
to
the
low-water
mark
of
the
river
and
wants
to
build
a
dock
and
a
pier
out,
that
extends
out
into
the
river?
does
that
citizen
have
to
get
permission
from
maryland
to
do
that?
justice
o'connor
what
if
maryland
takes
the
position
that
it
obstructs
navigation?
who's
going
to
decide
that?
virginia?
justice
o'connor
because
this
is
a
navigable
river,
the
federal
government
has
such
a
scheme
in
place.
justice
o'connor
but
riparian
ownership
usually
contemplates
beneficial
use
of
the
waters
on
the
riparian
land,
not
just
general
withdrawal
for
inland
uses.
