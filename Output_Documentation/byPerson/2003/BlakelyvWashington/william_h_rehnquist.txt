02-1632,
ralph
howard
blakely,
junior,
versus
washington.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
still
within
the
statutory
maximum,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
guarantee
of
jury
trial
for
a
finding
of
fact
in
apprendi,
it
is
to
be
logical,
why
should
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
court
or
the
legislature
sets
out
the
scheme?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can...
isn't
the
one...
isn't
that
washington
prescription,
that
we
talked
about
in
the
williams
case,
leaving
it
almost
completely
up
to
the
judge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
apprendi
say
that
all
the
elements
had
to
be
charged?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
but
the
question
was,
in
the
federal
system.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
obviously
we've
never
held
the
seventh
amendment
grand
jury
requirement
applied
to
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
fisher.
mr.

i
pronouncing
your

h.
rehnquist

you,
mr.
knodell.
mr.
dreeben,

hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

of
the
sentencing
