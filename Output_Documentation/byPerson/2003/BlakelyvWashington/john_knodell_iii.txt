mr.
john
knodell,
iii
you
are,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
whether
the
statutory
maximums
in
the
state
of
washington
is
what
the
legislature
says
it
is,
or
the
upper
end
of
the
standard
range,
established
only
for
the
purposes
of
enforcing
legislative
limitations
of
judicial
discretion
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
answer
to
that
question
lies
in
the
examination
in
the
way
that
the
statute
works.
in
washington,
the
legislature
of
course
like
all
states,
initially
defines
the
elements
of
a
crime,
and
sets
statutory
maximums.
and
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
elements
of
the
crime,
and
look
at
the
way
they
work,
you
will
see
that
they
are
substantially
different,
the
kind
of
sentencing
factors
that
are
dealt
with
in
reaching
aggravating,
or
mitigating
sentences
under
the
sentence
reform
act.
the
criminal
elements
apply
equally
in
every
case.
they
are
necessary
and
sufficient
i
think,
as
was
put
in
the
general's
brief,
in
each
and
every
case.
they
are
mandatory,
and
forced
to
consider
each
and
every
one
of
them,
the
fact
finder.
and
there's
only
one
result.
conviction...
conviction
or
acquittal.
there's
no
weighing
of
competing
interests,
there
is
no
discretion.
now,
i
offer
doing
this...
the
washington
legislature
then
created
the
sentencing
reform
act.
the
sentencing
reform
act,
i
would
submit
to
you
created
a
situation
in
the
state
of
washington
where
we
have
three
zones.
there's
first
a
standard
range
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
word
standard
in
the
sense
that
it's
used
by
the
washington
legislature,
it's
used
in
defense
as
a
basis
of
measurement.
the
standard
range
is
a
baseline.
it
is
a
zone
in
which
the
sentencing
court
has
absolute
discretion,
as
you
will
see
in
the
guidelines
themselves,
and
provisions,
that
a
sentence
within
these
guidelines
is
not
reviewable.
that
there's
absolute
discretion.
then
in
addition,
in
that--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--not--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--that's
exactly
right.
there
is
no
review.
and
i
would
just...
you
know,
i
would
just
to...
try
to
impress
upon
you,
justice
scalia,
that
the...
there
is
a
range
then
between
the
upper
end
of
the
sentencing...
of
the
standard
range,
and
the
statutory
maximum,
which
is
the
zone
where
the
limitations...
the
very
minor
limitations
i
submit
to
the
court
that
are
imposed
upon
the
sentencing
court
or
enforced,
that's
the
zone
of
limited
discretion.
this
limited
discretion
is
limited
only
in
two
ways.
the
court
cannot...
cannot
impose
a
sentence
beyond
the
range
for
reasons
that
the
legislature
considered
in
defining
the
crime
in
the
first
place,
and
the
court
cannot...
cannot
up
the
statutory
maximum...
cannot
impose
a
sentence
because
he
believes
that
the
defendant
committed
a
more
serious
crime
than
the
crime
of
which
he
was
convicted.
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
is
to...
is
to
ensure
that
the
defendant,
the
criminal
defendant
is
punished
only
for
the
crime
of
conviction.
the
standard
range
is
a
baseline,
the
statutory
maximum
is
a
borderline.
the
baseline
and
the
requirement
that
the
court
enunciate
reasons
for
departure
are
simply...
they
are
not
a
hurdle.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
there
is
a
fact
component,
but
if
we
look
only
at
the
fact
component,
justice
souter,
we
will
be
taking
a
very
impoverished
view
of
what
this
statute
does.
obviously
any
sentencing
decision,
any
discretionary
decision
is
based
in
some
degree
on
facts.
but
look
what
happens
under
the
washington
sentencing
reform
act.
the
court
has
a
list
of
illustrative
factors
from
the
legislature,
it's
true,
but
the
court
can
regard...
the
court
can
select
them,
cannot
select
them,
can
disregard
some,
can
regard
some.
it's
an
entirely
discretionary
procedure.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
well--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--he
could.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
no,
i
disagree
with
you,
judge,
but
he
would
be
reversed
for
two
reasons.
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
base
the
sentence...
it
doesn't
make
it
any
less
discretionary.
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
overturn...
excuse
me,
to
impose
a
sentence
that
has
absolutely
no
basis
in
the
record.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
two...
let
me
make
two
points
about
that.
discretion
lies
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
discretion
is
the
difference
between
a
crime
element
and
a
sentencing
factor.
i
believe
that
that,
when
you
take
a
look
at
how
the
statute
works,
that's
what
is
at
heart...
at
issue
here.
if
the...
if
the
judge
makes
a
decision
that's
not
based
upon
the
record,
that's
simply
pure
whim,
that's
a
due
process
violation.
that's
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
second
point
is,
i--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--well,
no
particular
fact
is
entitled...
is
required
to
be
found.
it
doesn't
make--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--that
process
that
you're
describing
where
the
judge
takes
a
look
at
the
case...
at
the
individual
before
him,
and
selects
what
facts
are
going
to
be
relevant,
and
decides
what
weight
to
give
them,
and
weighs
that
fact
against
competing
interests
in
sentencing
is
exactly
the
kind
of
process
that
the
judge
went
on...
went
through
in
williams.
that
is
a
constitutional
process
that
is
not
rendered
unconstitutional--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--i
disagree
with
that,
very
respectfully.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
there's
always
going
to
be
an
additional
procedure
before
the
judge.
there's
always
going
to
be
a
sentence
hearing.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
yes.
and
i
think
that
that...
what
you
have
to
remember
is
that
fact
finding
process,
is
not
like
finding
the
criminal
element
because
the
judge
is--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--that
is...
it
is
alike
only
in
the
superficial
sense,
justice
stevens,
because
you're...
it
ignores
the
process
that
leads
to
the
selection
of
that
fact
and
the
way
that
fact
is
weighed,
and
the
way
it's
used.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
that's
correct.
it's
based
on
a
finding
of
fact,
but
the
finding
of
fact
is
not
the
whole
picture.
after
selecting
the
fact,
making
the
finding,
then
the
judge
has
to
determine
whether
it's
substantial
and
compelling.
whether
this
crime
is
atypical,
whether
it
differs
substantially
from
other
crimes
of
the
same
type.
that
is--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--it...
it's
the
same
process,
justice
scalia,
that
you
went
through
in
williams.
in
williams,
you
had
the
judge
making
the
determination
of
fact
finding
that
went
beyond
the...
what
was--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--that's
right.
what
i
want
to
emphasize
to
you,
is
that
that
limited...
that
limited
jurisdiction
is
for
the
purpose
only
of
ensuring
that
the
reasons
that
are
multi-varied,
which
could
be
anything,
do
not
violate
the
principles
of
apprendi,
which
do
not
lead
to
the
defendant
being
punished
for
some
crime
that
he
wasn't
convicted
of.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
that's
true.
and
i
would
simply
add
he
has
to
make
a
finding
of
fact,
he
has
to
select
which
fact
is
relevant
and
then
he's
got
to
find
that
fact
is
substantial
and
compelling.
in
the
same
way
that
a
sentencing
judge
in
an
indeterminate
would
do.
the--
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
--that's
correct.
by
my
computation
however,
under
kidnaping,
if
this
had
been
kidnaping
i,
it
would
have
been
more
in
the
nature
of
150
months.
it
would
substantially
exceed
the
sentencing
cap.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
he
pled
and
he
was
specifically
told,
justice
ginsburg,
that
he
could
receive
up
to
10
years,
and
that
the
court
had
the
right
to
go
up
to
that
amount
if
the
court
found
aggravating
circumstances.
and
he
knew
that
there
would
be
a
hearing.
so
i...
i
think
what's
important
there,
is
not
so
much
what
the
number
was,
but
how
it
was
reached.
if
it
was
reached
in
a
way
that
basically...
and
i
don't
think
mimic,
but
was
similar
to
the
traditional
sentencing
process,
but
it
was
simply
structured
by
the...
structured
by
the
legislature
and
require
the
judges
to
enunciate
a
reason
solely
for
purpose,
not
as
a
hurdle
to
it,
not
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
beyond
the
standard
range,
but
more
as
a
way
for
reviewing
courts
to
make
sure
that
the
trial
court
was
not
infringing
upon
the
very
limited
limitations
of
the
sentencing
reform
act.
and
i
think
it's
substantially
different
than
apprendi.
and
it
does
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
is
the
way
that
our
supreme
court
described...
describes
this
and
interprets
the
sentencing
reform
act.
i
think
that's
due...
due
some
deference
by
this
court.
if
you
take
a
look
at
baldwin,
for
example,
you
see
baldwin
describing
the
process...
excuse
me,
as
one
where
the
only
restriction
on
the
court's
discretion
is
a
requirement
to
articulate
a
substantial
compelling
reason
for
the
imposing
a
sentence.
that
the
guidelines
are
intended
only
to
structure
discretionary
decisions
affecting
sentences
that
they
don't
specify
any
particular
result.
and
that
makes
this,
i
think,
substantially
different
from
the
kind
of
enhancements
that
we're
involving...
or
even
the
firearm
enhancement
that
mr.
blakely
received
here.
mr.
john
knodell,
iii
i
don't
know
of
any
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
that
kind
of
a
system
is
really
impractical
for
a
number
of
reasons,
we
take
it.
if
we
separate
the
logistical
problems
here,
there's
some
real
structural
problems
with
that.
in
a
state
like
ours
where
crimes
almost
have
to
be
pled.
you
would
basically
be
left
with
a
system,
where
the
prosecutor
can
tell
the
judge,
can
tell
the
jury,
dictate
to
them
what
sentencing
factors
will
or
will
not
be
considered.
when
you
instruct
the
jury
you
have
to
tailor
a...
some
kind
of
instruction
that
would
somehow
try
to
approximate
the
kind
of
wide
range
in
discretion
the
judge
has.
i
would
suggest
to
you--
