justice
ruth
bader

most...
most
of
these
cases
like
this
one
come
up
on
pleas.
they
don't...
they
were
trials,
yes.
and
the
jury
would
be
instructed,
but
how
would...
how
would
it
affect
the
typical
case,
where
there's
a
plea?
is
the
bottom
of
your
argument
that
if
you
enter
a
plea
you're
home
free,
from
any
enhancement,
there's
been
no
jury.
you
entered
a
plea
before
the
judge,
and
just
as
in
here
the
prosecutor
says
i'm
going
to
recommend
the
top
of
the
guidelines
29
to
53
months.
and
you
say
fine
i'll
plead
to
that,
and
the
judge
says
i
think
you
deserve
more,
is
the
terminal
point
of
your
argument
that
with
a
guilty
plea,
for
the
system
to
be
constitutional,
no
jury
now,
just
a
judge,
there
can't
be
any
enhancement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
defendant
would
have
to
say,
yeah,
i
stipulate
to
31
more.
otherwise
it
couldn't
be
given.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
that
hearing...
you'd
have
to
convene
a
jury
specially...
in
this
case
it
was
a
guilty
plea,
and
the
prosecutor
was
satisfied
with
49,
53
months.
the
judge
said
i'm
not
satisfied.
is
it
your
view
when
the
prosecutor
is
willing
to
make
that
deal,
doesn't
want
the
30
extra
months,
but
the
judge
wants
it,
once
the
guilty
plea
is
made,
then
can
the
judge
say,
never
mind,
prosecutor,
i
don't
like
that
bargain.
and
this...
do
you
have
to
convene
a
jury
specially
then,
just
this
jury
specially
to
hear
the
evidence
on
whether
there
should
be...
or
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
martin...
did
martin?
i
thought
that
in
the
washington
system,
if
the
defendant
disagrees,
the
judge
says
i
think
you
did
this
cruelly,
in
the
presence
of
a
child,
the
defendant
is
then
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
at
which
evidence
is
presented
and
the
judge
has
to
make
that
decision
about
the
additional
time
on
the
basis
of
a
record.
and
he
has
to...
he
applies
it,
it's
true,
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
but
it
is
based
on
a
finding
of
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
pretty
hefty...
i
mean
if
we
look
at
it
in
practical
terms,
on
the
night
of
incarceration,
this
was
30
months
added
on,
right?
so
it
was
about
a
third
of
the
total
sentence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
didn't
plead
to...
he
pled
to
kidnaping
ii.
