justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
other
half.
you
talked
about
one
half
of
apprendi,
what
about
the
other
half.
i
mean,
the
other
half
in
effect
says,
when
you
allow
fact
finding
by
judges
to
convert
crime
a
into
more
serious
crime
b,
you're
making
an
end
run
around
the
right
to
jury
trial,
isn't
the
same
thing
going
on
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
the
same...
i
mean,
no
matter
whether
it's
happening
under
the...
under
the
immediate
authorization
of
legislation
setting
up
the
guidelines
or
legislation
that
sets
up,
or
that
authorizes
a
component
of
judiciary
set
guidelines,
isn't
the
same
thing
going
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
he
didn't
agree
to
that,
there
wouldn't
be
a
plea.
i
mean,
if
the
prosecutor
says,
look,
i'm
claiming
an
aggravator
here
and
i
want
the
range
increased
that
would
have
to
be
part
of
that
stipulation,
the
deliberate
cruelty
would
have
to
be
part
of
the
plea
agreement.
if
it
wasn't,
there
wouldn't
be
a
plea.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
may
i
ask
you
this.
you
point
out
that
he
has
to
enunciate
reasons.
don't
the
reasons
have
to
have...
don't
they
have
to
cover
basically
two
components.
first,
they
have
to
cover
the
component
that
you've
alluded
to
and
that
is
some
kind
of
the
reasoning
for
engaging
in
the
act
of
discretion
of
going...
going
above.
it's
got
to
be
clear
that
this
is
not
just,
you
know,
more
prejudice
or
anything
like
that.
doesn't
it
also
have
to
have
as
a
component
the
identification,
the
finding
of
facts
upon
which
this
discretion
can
be
exercised.
take
this
case
as
an
example.
the
basis
for
going
above
was
cruelty.
unusual
cruelty,
whatever
it
was.
he
would
have
to
articulate
the
facts
i
suppose
that
a
gun
was
used,
that
the
woman
was
kept
in
this
box
a
great
deal
of
the
time
and
so
on.
which
would
make
it
sensible
to
say,
well,
yeah,
there's
cruelty
here
and
that's
a
reason
for
doing
what
i'm
doing.
it's
a
distinction
in
the
case
in
which
somebody
kidnaps
a
woman,
forced
her
into
a
mink
coat
in
the
back
of
a
limousine
that
wouldn't...
that
wouldn't
do
it.
so
there...
isn't
there
a
fact
finding
component,
even
though
the
statute
does
not
set
out
in
advance
what
those
facts
must
be
or
limit
what
they
must
be.
they
simply
must
be
relevant
to
the
act
of
discretion,
but
there
is
a
fact
component,
isn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
whatever
it
does
select,
they've
got
to
be
facts
which
at
least
would
morally
justify
going
above
the
ceiling.
the...
the
guideline
ceiling.
absent
those
kind
of
facts,
as
well
as
a
reasoned
judgment
based
on
them,
the
ceiling
governs.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
think
i
understand
what
you're
talking
about.
no,
i
mean
i'm
missing
something
in
the
description
of
the
system,
that's
what
i
need
to
have.
justice
souter
is
that
the
nub
of
your
argument?
that
apprendi
is
concerned
with
the
erosion
of
jury
trial,
by
the
combined
efforts
of
the
legislative
and
the
executive
branches
and
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
erosion
of
jury
trial
if
the
operative
determinations
are
left
entirely
within
judicial
discretion,
is
that
what
you're
argument
boils
down
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
that
in
fact
is
the
position,
then
i
take
it,
it
is
open
to
a
legislature
in
a
case
like
this
to
say,
instead
of
having
a
formal
maximum
range,
i
forget
what
it
is,
but
from
zero
to
10
years,
we're
going
to
make
it
zero
to
100
years,
and
we're
going
to
leave
everything
else
to
the
discretion
of
the
judiciary,
and
apprendi
in
effect
will
be
a
dead
letter.
but
your
argument
is
that's
okay,
because
we're
not
worrying
about
the
judiciary.
is
that
what
it
is,
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
