so
if
you
prevail
the
jury
gets
the
list
of...
of
all
the
11
factors,
plus
whatever
else
the
judge
thinks
might
come
up?
during
the
trial
do
you
have
to
prepare
them
for
that
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
transfer
that
whole...
your
rationale
to
the
federal
system
and
you
have
the
grand
jury
first
indict
us
to
the
aggravators?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
saying,
assuming
we
apply
your
rule
to
the
federal
system,
i
don't
know
how
we
couldn't,
quite
frankly.
you
can
get
a
grand
jury
indictment
for
all
the
aggravators.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
you're...
you
may
not
be
defendant
friendly
in
all
instances.
in
this
case,
if
the
defendant
really
wants
to
bargain
for
the
lesser
offense,
kidnaping
ii
instead
of
kidnaping
i,
i
suppose
the
prosecutor
would
say
that
part
of
the
bargain
is
that
you
stipulate
to
a,
b,
and
c.
and
then
he
doesn't
have
the
opportunity
to
argue
before
the
judge
that
he
wasn't
guilty
of
the
aggravators.
in
other
words,
it
could
work
both
ways.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
cap
for
the
kidnaping
i,
was
much
higher,
and
judges
so
often
when
they
see
aggravating
circumstances
get
close
to
whatever
the
cap
is
that
they're
applying.
so
i'm
not
sure
about
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
states,
or
many
states,
where
juries
hear
as
many
as
10
factors
as
part
of
their
determination,
and
then
make
special
findings
in
the
matters?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
is
consistent
with
what
we
said
in
apprendi,
isn't
it?
