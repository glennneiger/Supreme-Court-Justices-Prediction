mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
sentencing
guideline
systems,
like
the
state
of
washington's
and
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
fulfil
valuable
functions
in
regularizing
the
sentencing
process,
and
are
distinctly
different
from
the
systems
that
this
court
considered
in
apprendi
and
ring.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
the
united
states
will
argue
if
this
court
applies
apprendi
to
the
washington
guideline
system,
that
it
should
not
be
further
extended
to
the
administrative
guidelines
that
are
created
by
the
sentencing
commission.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
answer
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it's
possible
and
the
united
states
will
certainly
contend
that
this
court
apply--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there
are
some
obstacles
to
it
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of
before
it
concludes
that
apprendi
can
easily
be
applied
to
washington
and
not
to
the
federal
guidelines.
under
federal
law
section
35.53
(b)
of
title
18
the
sentencing
courts
are
required
to
impose
a
sentence
of
the
kind
and
within
the
range
specified
by
the
sentencing
commission.
so
there
is
an
act
of
congress
that
requires
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
be
applied.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
for
administrative
purposes--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
sentencing
guidelines
themselves
are
not
self-operative.
they
come
into
play
for
the
sentencing
courts
direction,
because
of
an
independent
federal
statute.
in
addition,
there
are
situations
which
congress
has
given
very
detailed
direction
to
the
sentencing
commission
about
the
type
of
guidelines
that
congress.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they're
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate.
and
they
do
not
include
only
members
of
the
article
3
branch.
in
addition
to
that
congress
has
on
occasion--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
certainly,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court
held
it
in
the
judicial
branch
but
the
question
is,
what
status
the
guidelines
have,
not
which
branch
the
commission
is
in.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you
for
the
lead
in,
justice
breyer.
i
think
that
the
best
way
for
the
court
to
look
at
the
problem
of
sentencing
guideline
systems
is
to
understand
the
penalty
systems
fall
on
a
continuum.
at
one
end
of
the
continuum
are
the
kinds
of
statutes
that
the
court
had
before
it,
williams
versus
new
york,
in
which
judicial
findings
about
fact
were
critical
to
what
sentence
a
defendant
actually
received
and
those
findings
were
not
subjected
to
a
jury
trial,
or
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
guarantee.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that
would
probably
have
been
reversed
even
at--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--very
little
but
sheer
arbitrariness
would
probably
not
have
sufficed
even
under
williams.
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
he
did--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
what
happened
in
fact
in
williams
is
critical.
the
judge
made
findings
that
this
defendant
had
a
long
arrest
record,
he
posed
a
future
danger
to
the
community
and
he
therefore
deserved
a
longer
sentence.
and
those
were
facts.
they
were
ascertained
by
a
judge.
and
there's
no
dispute
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
facts
that
are
ascertained
by
a
judge,
when
the
judge
has
wide
open
discretion
in
a
long
range
are
not
subject
to
apprendi.
the
facts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
what
the
legislature
expects,
justice
stevens,
when
it
gives
wide
ranges
to
judges,
is
that
they
will
exercise
their
discretion
based
on
facts
to
sentence
the
most
serious
offenders
at
the
top
of
the
range
and
the
least
serious--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
stevens,
what
i
would
submit
to
the
court
is
that
when
a
legislature
established
a
wide
range,
say,
10
to
30
years
in
prison
for
a
particular
offense,
it
expected
that
the
judges
that
heard
criminal
cases
would
use
their
experience
and
discretion
to
take
into
account
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
the
offender
and
determine
whether
rehabilitation
and
retribution
were
properly
served
by
a
longer
sentence,
or
a
least
harsh
sentence.
and
they
did
this,
in
the
expectation
of
calling
on
judicial
wisdom
based
on
particular
facts.
what
they--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
agree
with
that,
and
it
was
a
large
purpose
of
the
sentencing
guideline
system
to
provide
some
centralization
for
the
policy
decisions
that
are
made
in
sentencing
to
ensure
uniformity,
and
proportionality.
but
this
is
what's
critical
for
purposes
of
the
apprendi
decision
here,
also
room
for
individualization.
based
on
the
judge's
traditional
perception,
that
there
are
things
in
the
record,
or
in
the
character
of
this
defendant
that
were
not
taken
into
account
by
the
legislature
and
that
the
judge
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
will
determine,
deserve
a
higher
or
a
shorter
sentence.
now,
in
the
context
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
means--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
means,
justice
scalia,
that
the
facts...
that
the
legislature
itself
identifies
as
warranting
the
harsher
punishment
shall
be
found
by
the
jury.
but
when
the
legislature
says
to
the
judge,
impose
a
sentence
in
the
standard
range,
unless
you
in
your
discretion
determine
that
there
are
circumstances
that
take
the
case
outside
the
standard
range,
or
outside
the
heartland.
in
that
event,
the
judge
may
exercise
his
discretion
to
go
up
to
what
the
legislature
determines
is
the
statutory
maximum,
then
what
the
judge's...
what
the
legislature
has
attempted
to
do,
is
combine
a
system
that
will
regularize
and
provide
some
uniformity
but
at
the
same
time
import
that
williams
discretion,
the
traditional
discretion
that
this
court
has
recognized
is
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment.
and
i
submit
that
if
in
the
williams
era
a
legislature
had
passed
a
law
that
said,
judges,
we
are
giving
you
a
range
of
10
to
50
years
for
this
offense.
we
want
you
to
figure
out
who
should
be
sentenced
where.
we
want
you
to
find
facts
and
make
judgments
that
are
expressed
in
writing
so
that
we
can
see
what
you
are
doing.
and
we
want
you
to
put
the
worst
offenders
at
the
top
and
the
least
worst
offenders
at
the
bottom.
but
this
court
would
not
have
held
that
those
sorts
of
inroads
on
judicial
discretion
automatically
mean
that
the
sixth
amendment
kicks
in.
and
traditional
judicial
discretion
is
out
the
window.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
exactly
right,
and
that
is
exactly
what
washington
purported
to
do
when
it
said
there
are
illustrative
factors
that
we
are
going
to
put
in
a
statute
that
replicate
what
we
know
judges
have
traditionally
done,
but
we
are
not
eliminating
your
discretion
to
find
other
facts.
this
is
a
nonexclusive
list.
we
want
to
call
upon--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--precisely
what
you--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
a
label.
it
is
a
consequence
of
the
effect
when
the
legislature
says
these
are
the
facts
that
are
necessary.
here's
the
set,
you
use
a
gun,
you
engage
in
deliberate
cruelty,
you
have
a
certain
quantity
of
drugs,
you
have
one
of
those
facts,
and
nothing
else
can
justify
a
sentence
above
the
standard
range.
that
would
define
the
standard
range
as
a
statutory
maximum.
but
that's
not
what
washington
does
and
that's
not
what
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
do.
what
those
systems
do
is
say,
here
are
some
illustrative
facts
for
your
consideration.
but
we
are
not
going
to
cabin
your
discretion
to
identify
additional
aggravating
circumstances
in
the
exercise
of
the
time
immemorial
judicial
prerogative
to
look
at
all
of
the
facts
of
the
case
in
the
sentencing.
and
go
up
to
what
we
have
legislated
as
the
statutory
maximums.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
have
cabined.
they
have
cabined
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
but
my
point
of
the...
the
point
of
my
hypothetical
in
which
the
legislature
says
to
the
sentencing
judge,
find
facts,
put
the
worse
offenders
at
the
top,
apply
the
following
three
policies
of
sentencing.
proportionality,
retribution,
and
rehabilitation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
the
delegation--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
breyer,
if
what
the
legislature
does
is
say
to
the
judge,
here's
a
standard
range,
but
you
in
the
exercise
of
your
discretion
identifying
whether
a
factor
takes
the
case
outside
what
the
sentencing
commission
calls
the
heartland,
what
washington
calls
the
standard
range,
then
in
that
event
you
may
go
up
to
what
we
have
defined
as
the
statutory
maximum.
and
by
doing
that,
by
calling
upon
judicial
discretion
to
consider
unspecified
factors,
the
legislature
has
not
erected
surrogate
elements,
which
is
what
the
court
found
in
apprendi.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
what
it
boils
down
to,
justice
souter,
because
we're
starting
from
a
spectrum
at
which
one
end
lies
williams
versus
new
york,
in
which
the
court
fully
accepted
that
it
is
entirely
constitutional
for
a
judge
to
say,
in
my
courtroom
if
you
commit
a
kidnaping
and
you
engage
in
deliberate
cruelty
which
i'm
going
to
find
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
you're
going
to
get
the
maximum.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
follows
directly
from
williams
versus
new
york,
and
it's
an
additional
reason
why
this
court
should
be
very
reluctant
to
apply
apprendi
to
sentencing
guideline
systems.
washington
would
not
have
to
react
to
a
decision
applying
apprendi
to
its
guidelines
the
way
kansas
did.
washington
could
decide
that,
all
right,
if
the
problem
is
that
our
standard
range
created
a
top
of
a
statutory
maximum
term,
we're
just
going
to
do
away
with
the
top
of
the
standard
range,
and
we'll
leave
it
to
judicial
discretion,
with
the
following
policy
statements
to
give
some
guidance
to
what
they
do.
