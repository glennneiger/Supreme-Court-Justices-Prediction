mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sentencing
system
at
issue
here
contains
exactly
the
same
infirmities
that
the
system...
that
this
de-validated
two
years
ago,
in
ring
versus
arizona.
once
a
defendant's
convicted
of
a
felony,
washington
law
sets
a
statutory
cap
to
that
a
sentencing
judge
may
not
exceed
unless
there
are
facts
present
that
are
not
accounted
for
in
the
guilty
verdict.
these
are
called
aggravating
facts.
yet
in
washington,
just
like
arizona,
a
judge
makes
these
findings.
and
in
washington,
it's
even
worse
than
arizona
in
that
the
standard
of
proof
is
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
rather
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
statutory
maximum
as
apprendi
defines
that
term,
as
apprendi
and
ring
define
that
term,
is
the
highest
sentence
that
is
allowable
based
on
the
facts
and
the
guilty
verdict.
that...
that
sentence
in
this
case,
is
the
top
end
of
the
standard
range,
it
would
be
53
months
for
mr.
blakely.
you're
correct
that
washington
law
labels
an
additional
cap
as
what
washington
law
calls
the
statutory
maximum
which
is
the
ultimate
exceptional
sentence,
or
the
ultimate
enhancement
that
could
be
put
forward.
but
that
is
simply
a
second
cap.
the
question
that
this
court
in
apprendi
and
ring
asked
was
what
is
the
maximum
sentence
to
which
the
defendant
can
be
subjected
to,
based
on
the
facts
in
the
guilty
verdict.
and
that
is
the
top
of
the
standard
range.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
the
big
difference,
the
biggest
difference
between
the
federal
system
and
washington,
is
the
federal
system
is
a
system
of
court
rules.
not
a
system
of
legislative
mandates.
so
when
apprendi
and
ring
use
the
term
the
highest
penalty
authorized
by
the
legislature,
or
the
statutory
maximum
that
is
easily
applied
to
this
case,
because
all
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that
can
sometimes
be
the
case.
because
the
sentencing
system
that
is
at
issue
here,
is
fully
legislated.
however,
when
it--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
that
may
well
be
the
case,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
the
federal...
that
issue
in
this
case.
but
this
court's
clearly
held
williams
and
lots
of
other
cases
that
if
a
legislature
leaves
it
up
to
individual
judges
to
decide
what
kinds
of
facts
they
want
to
consider
in
meting
out
sentences
that
is
fully
constitutional.
and
as
this
court
described
the
federal
guideline
scheme
is
mistretta,
this
court
in
pages
395
and
396
of
that
opinion
said
what
we
really
have
is
just
an
aggregation
of
that
same
individualized
discretion.
just
make
it
a
little
bit
more
formal
in
the
federal
scheme.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
absolutely.
that
was
the
crux
of
the
holding,
justice
scalia.
i
realize
there
was
some
disagreement
on
that
issue.
however,
justice
o'connor,
to
get
back
to
your
question,
the
critical
distinction
is,
if
the
legislature
is
content
to
leave
it
up
to
judges,
or
the
judicial
branch
to
decide
what
factors
matter
and
where
lines
should
be
drawn,
then
apprendi
is
not
triggered
in
the
same
way
that
it
is
when
a
legislature
steps
in
and
says...
as
it
has
done
in
this
case.
we
are
not
prepared
to
allow
a
court
to
go
above
a
certain
threshold
unless
it
finds
additional
facts.
unless
additional
facts
are
present.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
two
parts
of
apprendi,
one
is...
footnote
16
of
apprendi,
this
court
talked
about
the
democratic
constraints
that
operate
on
legislatures
vis-a-vis
courts.
and
when
a
legislature
steps
in
and
says
we're
not
prepared
to
let
a
sentence
go
above
a
certain
level
unless
certain
facts
are
present,
that's
a
very
different
system,
than
when
a
legislature
steps
in
and
says
we
will
let
courts
operate
however
they
like
underneath
a
certain...
underneath
a
certain
system.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
that's
what
the
holding
in
apprendi
and
ring
would
dictate.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
that
is
what's
happening
in
this
case,
justice
souter.
and
what
happens
is,
and
it
takes
us
back
to
apprendi--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view
you
might
say
that
it
is,
but
there
is
a
difference
in
that
apprendi
talks...
the
baseline
of
apprendi
is
deciding
what
are
elements.
and
elements...
the
wellspring
of
elements
and
the
definition
of
a
crime
has
to
flow
from
a
legislative
function,
a
legislature
or
the
person
who
makes
the
laws
sets
out
what
facts
matter,
or
what
facts
don't
matter.
so
it's
absolutely
the
case
of
course
that
windship
and
the
sixth
amendment
apply
to
courts
just
as
much
as
they
apply
to
legislatures,
however
we
need
a
baseline
for
where
those
rights
kick
in,
and
i
think
that
the
proper
baseline,
or
a
proper
baseline
would
be
the
facts
that
the
legislative
body
or
the
lawmaker
has
set
out
that
matter
for
punishment.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
the
sixth
amendment
is
constitutional,
justice--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
difference
is,
in
the
washington
scheme
the
legislature
has
in
effect...
the
legislature
has
codified
the
sentencing
grid.
the
legislature
has
enacted
itself,
all
of
the
standard
sentencing
ranges.
whereas
in
the
federal
scheme,
the
legislature,
or
the
congress
has
left
it
up
to
courts
to
decide
where
the
standard
sentencing
ranges
ought
to
fall,
so
long
as
they're
under
an
ultimate
maximum--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
not
sure
i--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
reason
it
makes
a
difference
is
because
in
the
washington
system,
in
the
state
system
the
legislature
has,
as
a
policy
choice
with
democratic
constraints
operating
upon
it,
selected
a
maximum
that
it's
not
prepared
to
let
judges
go
above.
so
it's
constraining
the
discretion
of
judges.
in
the
federal
system,
congress
is...
you're
right,
congress
is
telling
judges,
we
want
you
to
come
up
with
rules
and
follow
them.
but
it's
leaving
it
up
to
the
judges,
the
judicial
branch,
to
come
up
with
what
the
rules
are.
so
the
only
significant
difference
that
comes
out
of
the
briefing,
between
this
case
and
the
ring
case,
is
that...
is
the
state
points
to
the
fact
that
unlike
ring,
where
you
had
10
aggravating
factors,
here
washington
sets
out
a
general
standard,
and
leaves...
and
says
11...
11
suggested
aggravators,
but
it
calls
those
aggravators
illustrative
rather
than
exclusive.
however,
we
believe
that
under
a
proper
application
of
apprendi
that
distinction
makes
no
difference.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it's
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
you
are
correct
but
if
they
did
leave
it
completely
up
to
the
judge
that
would
be
the
williams
case,
it
would
be
a
very
different
case
than
this
one.
however,
the
way
that
the
washington
law
is
written,
and
the
way
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
washington
courts
is
that
the
eleven
factors
are
illustrative,
and
so
therefore
if
a
court
is
going
to
depart
on
a
factor
that
is
not
one
of
them
on
the
list,
it
has
to
be
analogous,
or
fairly
closely
tied
into
the
factors
that
are
on
the
list.
so
in
the
ammons
case
for
example
which
is
one
of
the
first
washington
state
supreme
court
cases
interpreting
their
guideline
system.
they
said
very
bluntly
that
the
whole
purpose
of
this
system
was
to
take
away
the
unfettered
discretion
that
we
had
in
the
past
and
to
significantly
constrain
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
in
a
typical
system,
justice
kennedy,
there
are
one,
two,
maybe
three
aggra...
proposed
aggravating
factors.
so
what
we'd
be
proposing
is
that
yes,
during
the
trial
the
prosecutor
would
charge
an
aggravated
crime,
and
simply...
just
like
the
deadly
weapon
in
this
case,
they
would
have
charged
deliberate
cruelty.
and
the
judge
would
instruct
the
jury
on
what
deliberate
cruelty
means.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
so
long
as
the
guilty
plea
does
not
include
any
stipulation
to
an
aggravating
fact,
yes,
the
top
would
be
the
standard
range.
however--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
work
exactly
that
way,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
what
would
work
would
be
that
the
defendant
in
this
case--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
sorry.
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
in
this
case
for
example
the
defendant
would
have
pled
guilty.
and
he
could
have
said
i
agree
that
i
committed
deliberate
cruelty
in
this
case,
which
would
raise
the
cap
and
the
judge
would
be
able
to
do
a
sentence
anywhere
under
that
cap.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
absolutely,
justice
souter.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
the
way
it
works
right
now
in
washington,
is
that
if
the
defendant
enters
a
plea,
there's
a
presentence
report
that
goes
to
the
judge.
the
judge
can
also,
as
the
judge
should
in
this
case,
have
the
victim
testify
for
example.
however,
washington
law
specifically
provides
that
if
the
judge
wants
to
impose
an
exceptional
sentence,
based
on
aggravating
facts,
and
the
defendant
disputes
the
presence
of
those
facts,
washington
law
already
provides
in
section
370,
the
judge
has
to
hold
a
hearing.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
judge...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
justice
ginsburg,
certainly
my
case
doesn't
stand
or
fall
on
the
fact
that
the
judge
is
the
one
that
did
this
hearing.
however,
i
think
that
in
that
circumstance
it
seems
a
sensible
result
that
if
the
prosecutor
isn't
asking
for
an
aggravated
factor
and
nobody's
contesting
it,
then
the
judge
ought
to
either
be
bound
by
the
deal,
or
the
judge
in
the
interest
of
justice,
as
he
always
has,
can
say
i
don't
think
this
is
a
fair
plea.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yeah.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
it
varies,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
that
you're
right
that
apprendi
works
in
plea
bargaining,
but
with
all
due
respect
i'm
not
sure
that
i
accept
that
doesn't
work
in--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
justice
breyer,
the
same
thing
happens
for
example
when
there's
a
lesser
included
offense
in
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
as
i
said,
the
typical
situation
in
washington
is
more
like
two
or
three
aggravators.
i
understand
the
federal
system
is
more
complicated,
but
in
the
state
system,
there's
typically
two
or
three
aggravators
and
in
fact
washington
itself
proves
that
this
works.
because
washington
has
already
singled
out
several
factors
they
call
sentence
enhancements.
such
as
using
a
deadly
weapon,
selling
drugs
within
a
1000
feet
of
a
school
zone
and
some
other
ones
on
the
list
that
they
already
require
to
be
treated
exactly
in
this
fashion.
and
then
things...
and
i've
never
seen
anyone
complain,
and
with
certain--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
justice
breyer,
one
other
point
is
important
here
because,
in
many
cases
it's
not
going
to
be
such
a
big
problem.
however,
in
the
one
state
that
we've
seen
that
has
adopted
this
system
essentially
the
fix
that
we
think
would
be
the
proper
fix
here
in
the
state
of
kansas,
they've
said
that
if
a
defendant
contests
aggravating
factors
that
not...
they
have
to
be
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
however,
the
statute
also
provides
that
in
the
interest
of
justice
the
judge
can
sever
the
guilt
phase
and
the
sentencing
phase,
and
so
if...
it
puts
the
defendant.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
that's
generally
the
case,
and
that's
why
i
said
it's
just
like
what
might
happen
for
example
in
a
lesser
included
case,
when
murder
and
manslaughter
was
charged
and
it
was
the
defendant's
position
that
it
wasn't
him.
he
wasn't
around.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
well
as
i
said,
there
are--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
constitution
doesn't
prevent
congress
or
any
legislature
at
all
from
regularizing
criminal
sentencing.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
sentencing
guideline
systems
are
fine,
and
apprendi
says
nothing
about
whether
legislatures
can
come
in,
and
regiment
out
and
separate
all
the
factors.
the
only
thing
apprendi
says,
is
that
if
a
sentence
is
conditioned
on
a
certain
finding
of
fact,
and
there
is
a
dispute
about
that
finding
of
fact,
the
defendant
should
have
the
right
to
have
the
jury
make
that
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
rather
than
have
to
judge.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
assuming
the
federal
system...
if
you're
assuming
the
federal
system
was
covered
by
apprendi.
i
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
to
whatever
extent
a
grand
jury
needs
to
charge
aggravated
crimes
i
think
they
would
need
to
charge
it
and
then
apply--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yeah.
apprendi
says
that
under
fair
notice
principles...
i'm
going
to
stumble
here
a
little
bit.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'm
stumbling
over
the
grand
jury
because
this
is
a
state
case,
and
not
a
federal
one.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
but
to
the
extent
the
grand
jury
requirement
applied
it
would...
the
grand
jury
would
need
to
charge
the
aggravator
just
like
anything
else.
and
as
justice
scalia--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
it
can,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
injustice
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy.
he
made
a
deal
to
get
kidnaping
ii,
and
didn't
plead
to
any
aggravators,
however
he
got
a
sentence
that
was
more
in
line
with
kidnaping
i,
based
on
facts
that
he
never
acknowledged
and
he
disputed.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
by
my
study,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
there
are
only
about
17
states
that
have
guideline
systems
right
now.
by
my
count,
only
about
10
of
them
have
a
system
like
the
state
of
washington's.
the
other
seven
have
systems
where
they
do
create
standard
sentencing
ranges,
but
then
they
leave
it
up
to
the
judge
to
depart
from
those
ranges
whenever
they
want
to
based
on
any
reason.
those
systems
i
think
are
just
fine
no
matter
what
this
court
says
today.
so
i
think
we're
only
talking
about
those
10
systems
like
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
and
obviously
this
court
has
thought
a
lot
about
that
issue
already
in
the
prior
apprendi
case,
as
to
what...
what
the
effects
of
its
rulings
are
going
to
be.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'll
try.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
what
is
undemocratic...
leaving
it
up
to
judges?
yes,
but
that's
the
whole
point
of
apprendi
is
that
the
democratic
constraints
operate
on
a
legislature,
and
then
when
a
legislature
steps
in,
that
different
things
apply.
and
when
the
legislature
says
something,
as
footnote
16
in
apprendi
mentioned,
it's
a
different
force
than
when
leaving
it
up
to
the
judges.
if
it's
all
right
with
the
court,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
important
to
make
two
points
about
washington
law,
lest
the
court
be
left
with
any
confusion.
the
first
is,
the
washington
legislature
has
most
definitely
not
left
it
up
to
washington
judges
to
depart
upward
for
any
reason
they
want.
they
have
not
left
it
entirely
up
to
the
judges'
discretion.
a
judge
has
to
find,
as
the
judge
in
this
case
did,
one
of
the
eleven
listed
factors
or
one
that
is
analogous
to
those
eleven
factors.
and
there
are
case
after
case
in
washington,
or
appellate
decisions
saying
this
aggravating
fact
is
not
good
enough.
but
if
the
gore
decision,
and
the
cardenas
decision
both
cited
in
my
briefs.
another
example
is
barnes...
the
barnes
decision
at
818
p.
2d
1088
in
which
for
example
the
washington
supreme
court
said
future
dangerous
which
is
a
common
aggravating
factor
in
other
contexts,
it's
not
a
valid
aggravating
factor
in
washington
in
most
kinds
of
crimes
because
the
legislature
did
not
list
that
out.
and
in
fact
what
the
washington
supreme
court
said
there,
is
they
said,
if
we
were
to
find
that
we
would
be
giving
ourselves
too
much
discretion
back
for
the
very
point
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
was
to
take
discretion
away
from
us,
to
go
above
the
standard
sentencing
range.
the
second
point
about
washington
law
is,
mr.
knodell
is
right,
that
there
is
some
discretion
built
into
the
system,
but
that
discretion
kicks
in
only
after
the
judge
has
made
the
required
factual
finding.
in
that
respect
the
system
is
just
like
the
one
in
ring
where
the
aggravating
fact
is
necessary
but
not
sufficient
for
the
ultimate
sentence.
the
judge
still
can
in
his
discretion...
this,
justice
breyer,
goes
to
your
question,
the
judge
still
once
the
jury
or
the
proper
fact
finder
makes
all
the
required
factual
findings,
the
judge
can
still
consider
all
the
facts
in
the
case,
and
go
anywhere
below
that
new
maximum
that's
been
established.
so
judicial
discretion
is
still
retained
in
kansas'
system
and
it
would
be
retained
in
washington's
system.
and
the
final
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
mr.
dreeben's
point
that
this
case
is
different
than
ring
because
the
fact
that
they're
illustrative
rather
than
exclusive
would
lead
to
apprendi
simply
being
a
mere
formality
because
all
the
legislature
would
have
to
do,
for
example
in
the
ring
case,
is
have
factor
number
11
that
says
anything
similar
to
the
others
on
this
list.
then
you'd
have
people
saying,
well,
judges
can
do
just
about
what
they
were
doing,
which
was
finding
one
of
those
10
factors,
but
because
there's
factor
11,
that
says
something
similar
to
this
is
also
good
enough
that
apprendi
somehow
doesn't
apply.
we
submit
that
a
straightforward
application
of
apprendi
as
it
was
stated
in
ring,
requires
a
reversal
in
this
case.
