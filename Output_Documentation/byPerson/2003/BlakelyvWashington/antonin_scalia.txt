two
wrongs...
two
wrongs
make
a
right,
i
would
say
right.
justice
scalia
we
did
think
a
big
deal
in
mistretta,
did
we
not,
about
the
fact
that
the
sentencing
commission
is
in
the
judicial
branch.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
the
tough
question
is
whether
the
sentencing
guidelines,
or
rather
the
sixth
amendment
are
unconstitutional,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
judges
typically
impose
the
higher
penalty
where
there's
been
a
plea.
it
seems
to
me
it's
pretty
hard
to
do
that
when
you
haven't
had
a
trial.
what
does
the
judge
have
in
front
of
him
to,
you
know,
to
enable
him
to
make
the
fact
finding
that
justifies
the
aggravator?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right,
he
can
turn
down
the
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
and
does
he
only
get
the
presentence
report
after
the
plea
is
accepted?
or
does
he
get
it
before
the
plea
is
accepted?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
long
as
he
has
it
in
front
of
him,
before
he
rules
on
the
plea,
he
can
effectively
achieve
what
justice
ginsburg
is
concerned
about
by
simply
refusing
to
accept
the
plea,
unless
the
defendant
is
willing
to
confess
to
one
of
the
aggravating
factors.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
the
problem...
i
don't
see
the
problem
of
challenging
it.
it
is
up
to
the
prosecution
to
introduce
the
evidence
of
the
aggravators,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
prosecution
puts
on
one
of
the
customers
in
the
bank
who
says,
you
know,
he
was
using
a
gun.
the
defendant
is
not
going
to
be
testifying
anyway,
unless
it's
a
very
strange
criminal
trial.
it
seems
to
me
what
would
happen
is
exactly
what
would
happen
in
a
normal
trial.
the
defense
counsel
would
seek
to
break
down
the
story
of
the
witness
that
this
person
was
carrying
a
gun.
how
far
away
were
you,
what
kind
of
a
gun
was
it,
what
color
was
it.
the
same
thing
that
would
happen
in
any
trial
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
just
say
yes,
what's
so
outrageous
about
that.
the
man's
going
to
be
sent
to
jail,
for
another
five
years,
you're
saying
he
has
a
right
to
have
a
jury
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
did
the
additional
fact...
act
which
justifies
the
five
years.
what's
so
outrageous
that
that
needs
to
be--
--can
the
grand
juries
indict
him
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
upsetting
the
systems
for
states
does
not
seem
to
trouble
us
in
other
areas.
such
as
capital
punishment,
for
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
the
sentence
is
not
mandated
in
the
standard
zone?
justice
antonin
scalia
just...
you
can
give
them
up
to
10
years,
but
if
you
want
to
give
them
two
years,
that's
okay.
and
that's
not
reviewable?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
he
be
reversed
if
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
the
fact...
i
mean
he
says
i'm
giving
him
another
10
years,
because
he
used
a
gun.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
he
used
a
gun.
you
mean
he
cannot
go
up
on
appeal
and
get
that
additional
penalty
removed?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
because
it
depends
on
a
fact
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
call
it
an
abuse
of
discretion,
call
it
whatever
you
like.
you
know,
call
it
piggy
back.
but
the
fact
is
if
his
judgment
is
not
supported
by
the
facts
in
the
record,
he
is
reversed.
so
he
is
making
a
fact
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
pure
whim.
he
just
made
a
mistake.
he
got
this
record
mixed
up
with
another.
in
fact
there's
not
enough
evidence
to
support
that
fact.
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
get
that
judgment
reversed,
because
that
fact
is
essential
to
his
being
given
the
additional
penalty.
and
as
i
understand
what
we
said
in
apprendi,
and
as
i
understand
the
constitution,
when
you're
sent
to
jail
for
an
additional
amount
of
time,
on
the
basis
of
a
fact
that
is
required
to
be
found
before
you
can
be
sentenced,
that
has
to
be
found
by
a
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
particular
fact
is
entitled
to
be
found,
but
a
fact
which
the
judge
can
select
from
among,
but
he
has
to
select
a
fact.
and
whichever
one
he
selects,
whether
it's
carrying
a
gun,
or
cruelty
to
the
woman,
or
whatever
else.
that
fact
has
to
be
found
by
the
judge
and
there
has
to
be
support
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
else
he
does,
the
fact
is,
you're
being
sent
up
the
river
for
an
additional
three
years,
on
the
basis
of
a
fact
finding
by
a
judge
that
more
likely
than
not
you
were
carrying
a
gun.
more
likely
than
not
you
were
cruel
to
this
woman.
that
doesn't
trouble
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
that
the
two
standards
together,
that
if
this
is
invalid,
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
are
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
answer
is
no,
you
don't
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
is
possible
to
uphold
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
yet
find
this
to
be
unlawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sentencing
commission
is
in
the
judicial
branch.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
a
very
important
part
of
our
opinion
upholding
the
sentencing
commission.
it's
in
the
judicial
branch,
because
congress
said
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are...
the
commission
is
in
the
judicial
branch.
you
acknowledge
that.
you
argued
that
in
the
case,
or
the
government
argued
that
in
the
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
judicial
branch.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
could
be
foolish
enough
to
say
that,
you
know
i
don't
like
the
way
you
comb
your
hair.
but
he
wouldn't
say
that.
he
would
just
say,
you
know,
40
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
have
to
give
a
reason.
justice
scalia
but
it
wasn't
just
facts,
you
left
a
lot
of
discretion
to
the
judge.
if
the
judge
thought
that
this
particular
crime
was
becoming
rampant
in
this
community
the
judge
could
decide
we
need
to
make
an
example.
and
for
that
reason
give
the
individual
the
maximum.
it
wasn't
just
fact
findings.
the
judge
had
a
whole
lot
of
discretion,
he
had
sentencing
discretion.
it
was
really
up
to
him
whether
this
crime,
not
just
considering
the
facts
of
the
crime,
but
considering
the
needs
of
society,
should
be
given
a
longer
or
a
shorter
sentence.
justice
scalia
it's
a
different
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
just
answer
me
this.
i
will
understand
the
government's
position
if
you
give
me
an
answer
to
this
question.
if
you
do
you
not
think
that
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
guarantees
trial
by
jury,
if
you
don't
think
that
the
meaning
is,
that
every
fact
which
is
essential
to
the
length
of
sentence
that
you
receive
must
be
found
by
the
jury,
if
that's
not
what
it
means,
what
does
it
mean.
justice
scalia
what
is
the
limitation
upon
the
legislature's
ability
to
require
facts
to
be
found
and
yet
those
facts
not
to
be
found
by
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
determines
whether
a
fact
is...
it's
so
facile
it's
a
wonderful
solution.
justice
scalia
what
determines
whether
a
fact
is
an
element
of
the
crime
or
not?
justice
scalia
you
get
whacked
another
five
years,
another
five
years
for
it.
but
the
legislature
says,
oh
this
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
it's
just
a
sentencing
factor.
what...
how
do
you
separate
the
element
of
the
crime
from
sentencing
factors?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
used
to...
they
have
cabined
it,
judges
can
be
reversed.
if
they
give
the
additional
penalty
in
a
manner
that
is
not
permitted
by
the
sentencing
guidelines,
or
here
by
washington's
system.
don't
say
they
haven't
cabined
it
and
they
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
reversible.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
understated
the
prior...
the
prior
system.
because...
the
williams
system,
it
wasn't
just
the
judge
could
say,
if
you
kidnap
and
are
cruel
to
your
victims
i'll
give
you
the
maximum.
he
could
say
i...
in
my
court
if
you
kidnap,
you
get
the
max.
i
mean
there
were
judges
around
you
know,
known
as
maximum
john.
if
you
committed
a
certain
crime
you
would
get
the
maximum.
that's
a
different
system
than
what
we
have
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
case
is
no.
02-1632,
blakely
versus
washington.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
washington
state
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioner
ralph
howard
blakely,
jr.,
kidnapped
his
estranged
wife
and
her
son
from
their
orchard
home
in
grant
county,
washington.
he
drove
her
to
a
friend’s
home
in
montana
where
he
was
finally
arrested
the
next
day
after
the
friend
called
the
police.
the
state
of
washington
brought
criminal
charges
against
him
and
he
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to
the
reduced
charge
of
second
degree
kidnapping
with
a
firearm.
washington’s
sentencing
reform
act
specifies
a
"standard
range",
that
is
a
statutory
term,
of
49
to
53
months
imprisonment
for
that
offense
of
second
degree
kidnapping
with
a
firearm.
the
act
allows
a
judge
however,
to
depart
upward
from
that
standard
range
to
a
maximum
of
10
years
if
he
finds
exceptional
circumstances.
in
this
case,
the
judge
departed
upward
and
imposed
an
exceptional
sentence
of
90
months,
more
than
three
years
beyond
the
top
of
the
standard
range,
after
finding
that
blakely
had
committed
the
offense
with
deliberate
cruelty.
that
determination
was
not
based
on
facts
admitted
by
the
defendant
but
on
the
judge’s
own
findings
made
after
a
sentencing
hearing
at
which
the
victim
and
other
witnesses
testified.
blakely
argued
that
his
sentence
violates
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
jury
trial
because
the
facts
supporting
that
three
year
add
on
were
not
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
state
court
rejected
that
argument
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
conclude
that
the
90
months
exceptional
sentence
was
unconstitutionally
imposed.
the
sixth
amendment
provides
that
“in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
and
public
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.”
in
a
case
decided
four
years
ago,
apprendi
versus
new
jersey,
we
held
that
“other
than
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction,
any
fact
that
increases
the
penalty
for
a
crime
beyond
the
prescribed
statutory
maximum
must
be
submitted
to
a
jury
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.”
blakely’s
sentence
violated
this
principle
because
he
was
sentenced
to
more
than
three
additional
years
in
prison
based
on
a
finding
of
deliberate
cruelty
that
was
neither
found
by
a
jury
nor
admitted
in
his
guilty
plea.
the
state
argues
that
blakely’s
sentence
is
valid
because
even
though
it
was
above
the
standard
range,
it
was
still
below
the
overall
statutory
maximum
of
10
years.
we
conclude
however
that
the
relevant
statutory
maximum
for
purposes
of
the
aprendy
case
is
the
maximum
a
judge
may
impose
based
solely
on
the
facts
reflected
in
the
jury
verdict
or
admitted
by
the
defendant.
here,
the
judge
could
not
have
imposed
the
90
months
sentence
based
solely
on
the
guilty
plea
because
washington
law
requires
an
exceptional
sentence
to
be
based
on
factors
other
than
those
used
in
computing
the
standard
range
of
sentence.
the
right
to
jury
trial
is
fundamental
in
our
constitution.
the
sixth
amendment
requires
that
every
fact
which
the
law
makes
essential
to
the
punishment
be
found
by
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
without
that
restriction,
the
law
could
be
drawn
in
such
a
manner
that
a
judge
could
sentence
a
man
for
committing
murder
even
if
the
jury
convicted
him
of
only
illegally
possessing
the
firearm
that
he
used
to
commit
it,
or
of
making
any
illegal
lane
change
while
fleeing
the
death
scene,
the
fact
that
the
murder
could
be
found
by
the
judge.
the
dissenters
would
reject
our
holding
in
apprendi
but
they
provide
no
alternative
test
that
gives
coherent
content
to
the
right
of
jury
trial.
they
merely
say
that
the
judicially
prescribed
portion
of
the
sentence
cannot
be
excessive.
the
tail
cannot
wag
the
dog.
this
does
not
seem
to
us
a
constitutional
or
even
a
feasible
criterion.
our
holding
does
not
prohibit
determinate
sentencing
schemes.
it
merely
requires
the
facts
in
those
schemes
to
be
found
by
the
jury.
in
the
present
case,
for
example,
instead
of
having
a
postconviction
trial
before
the
judge
which
is
what
occurred,
there
could
have
been
a
postconviction
trial
before
the
jury.
this
is
perhaps
not
as
efficient
as
judicial
fact
finding
but
no
one
ever
claimed
that
jury
trial
was
efficient.
its
purpose
in
our
system
is
to
assure
that
the
people
control
the
third
branch
just
as
they
controlled
the
first
two.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
washington
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
