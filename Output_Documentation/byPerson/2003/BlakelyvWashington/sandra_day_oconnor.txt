justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
assume
that
if
your
position
were
adopted
it
would
invalidate
the
federal
sentencing
scheme
that
we
have
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
can't
see
much
difference.
your
point
is
that
if
the
same
scheme
that
washington
has
were
adopted
by
courts,
it's
okay.
justice
o'connor
so
are
you
here
to
say
if
washington
state's
legislature
said
that
for
a
burglary
conviction
that
a
judge
can
sentence
anywhere
from
10
to
20
years.
based
on
the
judge's
discretion,
that's
perfectly
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
justice
ginsburg,
down
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
fisher,
if
you're...
if
you
are
correct
here,
i
suppose
all
50
states
have
sentencing
schemes
that
would
fall
as
a
result,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
don't
mean
it's
easily...
it's
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case.
today’s
decision
will
create
great
uncertainty
for
judges,
prosecutors,
and
defense
attorneys.
it
will
generate
probably
thousands
of
cases
in
courts
around
the
country
as
parties
attempt
to
cope
with
sentencing
requirements
unlike
any
of
the
nation
has
previously
applied.
the
adverse
impact
of
the
majority’s
holding
on
sentencing
reform
efforts
across
the
country
will
be
far
reaching
and
disastrous.
as
justice
breyer
observes
in
his
dissent,
the
court’s
holding
leaves
legislatures
with
one
of
three
sentencing
options.
each
of
which,
risks
either
impracticality,
unfairness,
or
harm
to
the
very
constitutional
interest
the
majority
purports
to
vindicate.
the
first
would
be
a
pure
charge
offense
or
determinate
sentencing
scheme,
whereby
all
defendant
convicted
of
a
particular
crime
receive
identical
punishments
regardless
of
differences
in
their
backgrounds,
character,
or
the
nature
of
a
crime.
the
congress
and
state
legislatures
long
ago
rightly
rejected
this
unjust
system.
the
second
possibility
would
be
a
return
to
the
pre-reformed
days
of
indeterminate
sentencing
and
untethered
judicial
discretion
in
imposing
sentences
within
an
upper
limit
set
by
the
legislative
branch,
but
experience
has
shown
that
indeterminate
sentencing
schemes
that
rely
on
individual
judicial
discretion
result,
in
many
cases,
in
severe
and
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities.
indeed,
it
is
this
very
experienced
that
has
prompted
the
state
of
washington
to
adapt
the
regime
struck
down
today.
the
final
option,
which
the
court
seems
to
think
congress
and
state
ligislatures
will
choose,
would
be
to
retain
guideline
schemes
but
submit
all
facts
that
increase
the
upper
limit
of
the
applicable
sentencing
range
to
the
jury
or
to
a
second
jury.
the
cause
of
such
a
system
would
be
exorbitant.
prosecutors
would
be
required
to
charge
five,
ten,
maybe
more
different
factual
elements
in
every
indictment.
courts
would
be
forced
to
hold
separate
penalty-faced
jury
trials
so
that
prejudicial
evidence
relating
the
punishment
would
not
taint
the
guilt
face
determination.
prosecutors
would
be
forced
to
bring
separate
criminal
prosecutions.
if
facts,
bearing
upon
punishment
were
discovered
only
after
the
original
indictment
or
during
the
trial
process.
to
the
extent
that
congress
and
state
legislatures
are
unwilling
or
unable
to
bear
these
additional
costs,
there
will
be
an
inevitable
increase
in
judicial
discretion
with
all
of
its
attendant
failings.
the
immediate
practical
consequences
for
sentencing
courts
and
prosecutors
starting
this
very
afternoon
will
be
equally
unsettling.
does
today’s
decision
apply
in
full
force
to
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines?
must
indictments
now
contain
all
sentencing
factors
to
be
charged
as
elements
of
the
crime?
if
so,
must
state
and
federal
prosecutors
re-indict
everyone
currently
charged
wit
a
crime?
when
and
how
must
separate
punishment-faced
trial
be
held?
what
are
the
constitutional
and
statutory
evidenciary
requirements
applicable
to
those
proceedings?
how
are
juries
to
deal
with
highly
complexed
and
often
times
open-ended
sentencing
guidelines
provisions
obviously
written
for
application
by
experienced
judges?
what
happens
to
defendants
who
have
already
entered
pleas
of
guilty
and
are
awaiting
sentencing?
the
court
ignores
these
questions
as
well
as
the
havoc
it
is
about
to
wreak
on
trial
courts
across
the
country.
now,
if
the
court
were
vindicating
a
clear
constitutional
principle,
i
could
accept
the
uncertainty
and
costs
imposed
by
today’s
decision.
it
is
not.
indeed,
the
scheme
struck
down
today
has
served
not
undermined
sixth
amendment
and
due
process
values.
after
passage
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
defendants
in
the
state
knew
what
their
presumptive
sentences
would
be,
they
knew
what
the
real
stakes
of
going
to
trial
were,
they
knew
what
facts
about
their
crime
and
criminal
history
would
be
relevant
in
the
sentencing
court,
they
were
guaranteed
meaningful
appellate
review
to
protect
against
an
arbitrary
sentence,
and
finally,
they
were
ensured
that
invidious
characteristic
such
as
race,
would
not
impact
their
sentences.
in
my
view
the
sentencing
scheme
adopted
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
and
other
states
who
have
enacted
similar
schemes
was
a
sensible
and
constitutional
response
to
the
lack
of
transparency
and
the
wide
sentencing
disparities
and
here
in
the
state’s
pre-reformed
system
of
indeterminate
sentencing.
because
i
find
that
unpersuasive
that
either
the
sixth
amendment
or
due
process
after
more
than
200
years
can
be
found
today
to
compel
this
result.
i
respectfully
dissent.
my
dissent
has
been
joined
by
the
chief
justice
except
as
to
part
4b
and
by
justice
kennedy
except
as
to
part
4b,
and
has
been
joined
by
justice
breyer.
