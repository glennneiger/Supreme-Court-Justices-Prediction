yes,
but
in
williams
there
was
no
intermediate
level
that
he
couldn't
go
above.
there
is
here,
isn't
there?
under
the
standard
sentencing
system,
are
they...
did
the
other
side
misrepresenting
this?
i
understood
that
given
what
the
man
admitted
in
the
guilty
plea
he
could
be
sentenced
to
what,
53
months.
and
not
above
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
additional
procedure
before
the
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
require
the
judge
to
find
a
fact
that
had
not
been
established
previously.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
not,
if
it
increases
the
sentence
by
five
years.
why
isn't
it
exactly
the
same
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
legislature
hadn't
put
an
intermediate
level
on
what
he
could
do
without
the
additional
finding,
which
you
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
correct
that
that
intermediate
limit
is
something
he
cannot
go
above,
unless
he
makes
an
additional
finding
of
fact?
it's
not
been
established
at
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
that
but
the
judge
didn't
even
have
to
make
any
findings.
he
could
have
just
said
his
name
is
smith,
so
i'm
going
to
give
him
20
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
so
at
that
time,
there
was
very
little
appellate
review
of
sentencing
on
williams
that
was
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
does
he
have
wide
open
discretion,
but
he
has
no
obligation
to
make
those
findings.
he
did
make
them
in
that
case,
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
that
required
him
to.
justice
stevens
that's
what
they
expect
under
sentencing
guidelines
and
what
they
expect
today.
it's
not
what
they
expected
when
williams
was
decided.
