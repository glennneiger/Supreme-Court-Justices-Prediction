justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
wonder
what
if
the
statute
in
the
guidelines
case,
says
to
the
judge,
judge,
you
must
impose
a
sentence
that
the
commission
has
written
unless
you
depart
for
certain
reasons.
the
washington
statute
says,
you
must
impose
the
sentence,
da,
da,
da.
unless
and
it
has
similar
kinds
of
things,
special
aggravating
circumstances,
for
example.
in
neither
case
can
you
go
beyond
the
outer
limit
in
the
one
case,
25
years,
or
10
years
in
the
other
case,
the
statutory
max
in
the
statute.
what
again
is
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know
the
reason...
the
difference
is
that
in
sentence...
the
federal
statute
says,
judge,
you
must
apply
the
grid
of
sentence.
and
in
washington
it
says
you
must
apply
the
word
eight
years,
unless
three
years,
unless...
in
the
other
words,
apply
what
the
commission
said.
that's
the
difference,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
washington
statute,
it
says,
judge,
if
you
have
an
ordinary
case,
you
must
sentence
the
person
to
three
years.
but
if
it's
not
ordinary
go
to
10,
no
more
than
10.
in
a
federal
case,
it
says,
judge,
if
you
have
an
ordinary
case,
you
must
apply
the
sentence,
now
the
commission
fills
in
that
blank.
but
if
it's
not
ordinary,
go
to
eight
years.
so
the
blank
is
filled
by
the
commission
in
one
case,
by
the
legislature
in
the
other.
the
first
stage
blank.
why
does
that
make
a
difference
constitutionally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
this
moves
the
entire
system.
i
mean
i
am
now...
the
light
has
dawned
slightly...
the
reason
i
guess,
i'd
like
your
view,
but
the
defense
thought
like
apprendi
and
pursues
these
cases
because
95
percent
of
the
people
in
prison
are
not
there
pursuant
to
a
jury
trial.
rather
they're
there
because
of
plea
bargaining.
and
it
will
work
in
the
plea
bargaining
context,
though
it
won't
work
at
all
in
the
trial
context.
you'd
have
to
go
and
argue,
my
client
was
in
chicago,
but
by
the
way
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
he
only
hit
the
person
lightly
not
heavily
as
the...
so
that
wouldn't
work
at
all.
but
you
don't
mind
because
your
job
everyday
is
plea
bargaining.
if
i'm
right
about
that,
i
want
to
know
if
i
am
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
let's
go
to
the
trial.
the
person,
as
you
know,
robbed
a
bank.
used
a
gun,
took
a
million
dollars
and
not
just
a
thousand.
brandished
another
gun,
and
hurt
an
old
lady.
all
that's
charged.
you
want
to
say,
my
client
was
asleep
at
home,
yeah.
now,
how
do
you
defend
yourself
against
all
those
aggravators.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
it
does,
but
they're
very
limited
numbers
and
you
can
work
with
a
few.
what
you
can't
work
with
is
five
or
10,
or
particularly
a
very
important
one,
but
anyway,
you
explain
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
but
i'm
just
curious.
i
understand
that
that
must
be
so,
because
you
have
the
experience.
but
what
i'm...
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
does
that
happen.
if
my
client
wanted
to
say
he
basically
wasn't
guilty
of
the
offense,
then
i
want
to
say
and
also
he
wasn't
near
the
school,
or
also
he
only
used,
you
know,
the
ones
you
say.
how
do
you
present
that
to
a
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
put
on
the
witness
that
says
i
want
to
tell
you...
they
say
he
hit
her
with
a
gun
and
your
witness
wants
to
say,
oh
no
he
only
he
brandished
a
gun,
he
didn't
hit
her.
that's
quite
a
good
witness
to
put
on
at
the
time
that
you're
claiming
that
he
was
across
the
room.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
sometimes
works,
sometimes
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
bizarre
thing
about
this,
which
of
course
i
said
i'm
in
the
minority
here.
the
bizarre
thing
is,
it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires,
not
that
it
doesn't
permit.
but
requires
a
sentencing
commission
should
congress
wish
to
take
discretion,
total
discretion
away
from
the
judge,
which
of
course
your
distinction
leads
to.
it's
also
very
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
prohibits
congress
from...
prohibits
it
from
saying,
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
leave
that
up...
to
each
judge
to
decide
whether
having
a
gun
is
worth
two
years,
or
five
years
more.
i
want
to
regularize
this.
so
those
are
the
two
dilemmas
because
you
have
to
chose
a
or
b,
if
there's
something
unconstitutional
about
this.
justice
breyer
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
i'd
be
afraid
the
effect
is
going
to
be
enshrine
the
plea
bargaining
system
forever.
because
that
will
be
the
only
practical
thing.
or
to
say
there's
a
constitutional
requirement
that
you
have
to
have
a
sentencing
commission
and
the
legislature
can't
do
the
work
itself,
which
is
both
undemocratic,
a
little
hard
to
see
why
that's
so...
and
produces
just
as
much
unfairness
of
the
kind
you're
complaining
about.
disabuse
me,
if
you
can,
of
these
pessimistic
views.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
agree
that
it's
undemocratic?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
your
distinction.
look
where
i
end
up.
apprendi
rests
on
a
perception
that
where
a
fact
is
found
that
means
a
longer
time
in
jail.
it's
unfair,
not
to
have
the
jury
find
it.
that's
a
true
perception.
so
if
you're
not
going
to
follow
that
across
the
board,
there
has
to
be
a
good
reason
for
not
following
it.
and
the
reason
is,
that
if
you
do
follow
it,
you
end
up
with
a
pure
charge
event
system,
all
power
to
the
prosecutor,
very
bad
and
unfair.
or
california,
indeterminate
sentencing
where
people
rot
forever
at
the
judge's
discretion,
or
a
multi-jury
system
which
is
impossible
to
work
with.
so
that's
why
you
can't
follow
the
perception.
practical
reasons.
but
if
you're
going
to
limit
apprendi,
you're
then
going
to
have
to
find
what
are...
in
terms
of
the
principle,
arbitrary
distinction.
one
such
arbitrary
distinction
is
it
matters
whether
it
was
a
group
of
judges
called
the
commission
or
the
congress
itself
that
set
the
lower
limit
before
the
departure.
another
arbitrary
suggestion
is
going
to
be
the
one
you're
going
to
suggest,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
mean
that
the
facts
that
are
elements
of
the
crime
must
be
found
by
the
jury.
the
facts
that
are
not
elements
of
the
crime,
that
are
pertinent
to
punishment
can
be
found
by
a
judge?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
it
used
to
be
that
the
answer
to
the
elements
question
was
the
people
will
decide
what's
an
element
through
their
elected
representatives.
but
after
apprendi
we
have
to
find
some
other
way,
all
right.
so
you're
saying,
well,
if
it
is
a
delegation
from
the
legislature,
use
your
judgment,
as
judges
used
to
do
in
sentencing,
and
find
those
facts
in
the
process.
it's
not
an
element,
it's
relevant
to
sentencing.
is
that
the
key?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
i
got
the
key?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rephrase
it,
because
i'm
trying
to
get
the
precise
key
to
what...
to
what
it
is.
i
said
general...
i'm
using
general
policies,
that
isn't
the
right
word.
what's
your
word?
