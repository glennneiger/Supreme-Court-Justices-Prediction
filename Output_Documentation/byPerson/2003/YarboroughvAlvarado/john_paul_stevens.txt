justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
this
one
question?
i
thought
you
conceded
that
if
he
were
only
6
years
old,
that
would
be
relevant.
and
the
question
presented
is
whether
age
is
ever
relevant.
what...
what
is
your
position
exactly?
is
it
it's
okay
to
consider
it
if
he's
6
but
not
if
he's
17-and-a-half?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
as
to
whether
he
thinks
he's
free
to
leave.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
true
there
was
testimony
on
it,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the...
the...
page
2
of
the
red
brief
gives
transcript
cites
for...
as
michael...
his
parents
asked
if
they
could
come
in
and
detective
comstock
refused
to
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
j.a.
49--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
your
view
is
different
from
your
colleague.
she
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
record.
you
say
there
are
just
no
findings
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
the
child
whose
parents
were
denied
permission
to
come
into
the
room
would
draw
any
inference
about
whether
he
could
leave
at...
anytime
he
wanted
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
make
a
difference
in
that
inquiry
if
the
person
being
interrogated
was
35
years
old,
on
the
one
hand,
and
10
years
old
on
the
other
hand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
telling
me
that
the
35-year-old
example
and
the
10-year-old
example
should
be
treated
precisely
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
he
thinks
he's
in
custody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
really
don't
understand.
if
you
seem
to
agree
that
a
6-year-old
would
be
more
likely
to
feel
submissive
to
authority,
is...
does
it
not
follow
inexorably
he,
therefore,
would
reasonably
feel
he
could
not
leave
when...
where
an
older
person
would?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
yes
or
no
on
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me...
let
me
restate
it.
you...
you
say
that
you...
the
6-year-old
would
feel
more
submissive
to...
to
an
officer.
does
it
not,
therefore,
follow
that
he
would
be
less
likely
to
think
he
was
free
to
leave
than
an
older
person
would?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
isn't
age
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
relevant
to
the
question
whether
he's
in
custody.
that's
the
only
thing
we're
asking
about,
not
the
miranda
warning.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it...
if
it
makes
a
difference
of
his
age,
why
doesn't
that
make
it
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
relevant
by
even
a
tiny,
tiny
bit
if
you've
got
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
to
say
it
isn't
very
much...
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
a
6-year-old,
the
16-year-old,
and
the
18-year-old
in
your
presentation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
based
on
testimony
presented
in
the
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
mentioned
in
the
court's
opinion,
that
they
brought
him
to
the
station
house.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
both
mr.
and
mrs.
alvarado
came
to
the
sheriff's
station
with
their
son.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
so
then
they
did
talk
about
some
of
these
circumstances.
it's
not
correct
to
say
they
mentioned
none
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
right
in
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
also
not
true
that
in
many,
many
cases,
voluntariness
may
remain
an
issue,
for
example,
as
in
oregon
against
elstad.
if
there's
a
preliminary
question
followed
by
miranda
warnings,
you
first
have
to
look
at
the
voluntariness
of
the
first
interrogation.
so
we
haven't
abandoned
voluntariness
as
a
relevant
issue
in
these
cases.
