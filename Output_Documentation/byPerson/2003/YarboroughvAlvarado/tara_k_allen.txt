ms.
tara
k.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
first
like
to
start
by
clearing
up
some
things
about
the
record
that
the
court
was
asking
about
earlier.
as
far
as
the
parents'
being
refused
permission
to
attend
the
interview,
that
was
a
finding
of
fact
made
in
the
federal
district
court.
it
is
contained
in
the
magistrate's
report
and
recommendations
in
this
case,
and
it
can
be
found
at
joint
appendix
49
and
also
the
petitioner's
brief,
appendix
b3.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court.
as
far
as--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--i
believe
they
based
it
on
the
petition
for
habeas.
this
contention--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
no,
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
federal
court.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
and
there
was
no
testimony
in
the
state
court
either.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
at
the
motion
to
suppress
in
the
trial
court,
in
the
state
court,
the
argument
was,
in
both
the
written
motion
to
suppress
and
the
oral
argument
in
front
of
the
court,
that
the
parents
were
refused
permission
to
attend
the
interview.
the
state
never
objected
to
that.
they
never
contested
it.
it
was
in
the
briefs
on
direct
appeal
and
it
wasn't
contested
there.
the...
the
first
time
it's
been
contested
is
now.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
no
one
objected
to
it.
and
the
state
has
a
right
to
object--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--yes,
certainly.
and
when
a
magistrate
files
a
report
and
recommendation,
either
party
can
object
to
any
facts
that
are
not
correct,
and
they
didn't
do
that
in
this
case.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
secondarily--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--that
was
the
reporter's
transcript
from
the
motion
to
suppress
at
trial...
pretrial.
secondarily,
there
was
some
contention
about
whether
detective
comstock
was
armed.
that
is
also
found
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
65,
note
29,
and
it
was
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
as
well,
citing
the...
alvarado's
interview,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
there
was
some
contention
about
whether
mr.
alvarado,
michael,
was
referred
to
as
a
suspect.
that
can
be
found
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
189.
that
was
argument
of
trial
counsel
during
the
motion
to
suppress.
it
was
not
disputed
at
that
point.
it
hasn't
been
disputed
until
now.
but
i
would
assert
that
in
addition
to
that,
even
if
he
had
not
heard
another
officer
refer
to
him
as
a
suspect,
it
was
obvious
by
detective
comstock's
word
and
deed
to
him
during
the
interrogation
that
he...
he
indeed
was
a
suspect.
and
the
last
contention
is
my--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--yes.
and
this
court
in
california
v.
stansbury
found
that
anytime
that
it's
communicated
to
a
suspect
by
word
or
deed
that
he
is
a
suspect,
that
that
goes
into
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
whether
that
person
would
reasonably
feel
free
to
leave.
secondly,
i
would
like...
well,
one
more
thing
on
the
facts.
the
fact
that
michael
said,
can't
somebody
come
in
here
with
me,
is
found
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
185.
that's
also
trial
counsel's
argument
at
the
motion
to
suppress
that
was
not
disputed
until
now.
but
next
i
would
like
to...
to
move
to
this
idea
of
this
being
a
new
context.
miranda
is
the
son
of
voluntariness
and
coercion.
this
court
found
in
1948
in
haley
v.
ohio
that
juveniles
in
general
are
more
susceptible
to
police
coercion
than
adults.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
i
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
is
it
a
plurality?
ms.
tara
k.
allen
plurality
of
this
court,
yes,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
it
recognized
that
juvenile
status
be
taken
into
consideration
when
determining
the
proper
procedural
safeguards.
in
miranda
in
1966,
this
court
found
that
those
procedural
safeguards
would
be
the
miranda
warnings.
and
then
in
in
re
gault
in
1965,
the
court
found
that
the
greatest
care
must
be
taken
to
assure
a
minor's
confession
was
voluntary
not
only
in
the
sense
that
it
was
coerced,
but
also
that
it's
not
a
product
of
ignorance
of
rights.
it
follows--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--if
you
were
to
recite
a
miranda
warning
to
a
6-year-old,
in
the
waiver
determination
they
would
decide
whether
that
6-year-old
understood
the
waiver
of
his
rights,
and
the
evidence
would
come
in
there
as
well.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
the
giving
of
a
miranda
warning
doesn't
suffice.
it
severely
cuts
down
the
cases
in
which
you
can
contest
coercion.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
however,
if
you
cite
a
miranda
warning
to
a
17-year-old,
it
may.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
that's
correct.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
usually--
[laughter]
ms.
tara
k.
allen
i...
i--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--that's...
that's
right.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
and
in
most
circumstances
you're
not
prosecuting
6-year-olds.
you're...
you're
prosecuting
teenagers.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
when
you
read
the
california
state
opinion
in
this
case,
they
don't
mention
michael's
age.
they
don't
mention
anything
about
the
fact
that
he
was
a
juvenile
or
how
a
reasonable
juvenile
would
have
assessed
the
situation.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
is
your
question
if
they
thought
it
didn't
matter?
ms.
tara
k.
allen
well,
the
objectively
unreasonable
thing
about
what
the
california
court
did
in
this
case
was
they
recited
the
correct
test
for
custody,
yet
they
completely
failed
to
imply
it.
when
they
were
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
they
spent
their
entire
time
distinguishing
a
state
case
from
this
case
and
finding
that--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--as
this
court
has
found,
a
totality
means
a
totality.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
no,
your
honor.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
most
certainly
they
should
discuss
the
factors
that
make
a
difference,
and
in
this
case
they
didn't.
they
didn't
discuss
any
of
the
factors
that
made
a
difference.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
it's
more
than
the
age
in
this
case.
not
only
is
it
a
reasonable
juvenile
standard,
but
also
it's
the
enlisting
of
the
parental
authority
to
bring
him
to
the
station,
the
refusing
of
permission
for
the
parents
to
attend
the
interview
in
front
of
him.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
when
they're
talking
about
the
facts,
they
take
the
facts
from
detective
comstock's
interview
where
she
says,
i
called
the
parents
and
had
them
come
down.
she
doesn't
say
anything
about
refusing
them
permission.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
yes.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
they--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--they
didn't
mention
that
they
were
refused
permission,
and
they
didn't
mention
that
michael
was
17.
i
guess
you
can
infer
from
the
fact
that
she
called
the
parents
that
he
was
under
the
age
of
majority.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
well,
part
of
the
record
were
the...
the
trial
transcripts
which
included
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing,
and...
and
the
briefs
cited
to
that
and
the
motion
itself.
so
it
was
in
the
record.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
well,
where
they're
not
disputed
by
the
prosecution
and...
and
the
judge
finds
no
contrary
finding
and
they're
argued
in
all
the
briefs
without
the
respondent
saying
that
that's
not
correct,
it
seems
reasonable
that
the
court
of
appeal
would...
would
take
that
as
fact.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
i
think
even
if
michael
had
been
18
and
the
court
had
no
duty
to
apply
a
reasonable
juvenile
standard,
there
are
plenty
of
facts
that
point
toward
custody
in
this
case
not
only
the
parental
involvement,
but
the
very
fact
that
this
interrogation
took
place
in
an
interrogation
room
at
a
police
station.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
what
the
state
court
held
was
objectively
unreasonable
because
they...
they
failed
to
apply
the
clearly
established
federal
law
from
this
court,
which
is
thompson
v.
keohane.
the
recited
it,
but
completely
failed
to
apply
it
in
any
meaningful
way.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
in
the
respect
that
that
case
says
you
need
to
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
an
interrogation,
and
once
you
add
up
those
circumstances,
you
decide
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
have
felt
free
to
leave.
that's
a
cumulative
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
the
california
court
did
not
look
at
the
factors
together
cumulatively.
they
took
two
factors
to
distinguish
this
case,
neither
of
which
was
proper:
one,
that
the
police
did
not
tell
him
affirmatively
that
he
could
not
leave
until
he
told
the
truth,
which
would
be
a
finding
of
custody
straight
off.
you
would
never
even
get
to
the
totality
test.
and
two,
that
the
tactics
weren't
intense
and
aggressive
enough
to
prove
coercion.
and
as
this
case
said
in
kaupp,
interestingly,
just
as
you
can't
require
the
perversity
of
resisting
arrest
to
prove
coercion,
here
you
can't
require
the
perversity
of...
of
this
being
coercive
to
prove
custody.
you
can't
use
a...
say
that
the...
the
police
had
to
have
enlisted
intense
and
aggressive
tactics
in
order
for
this
to
be
custody.
that's
not
even
part
of
the
custody
determination.
there
are
things
like
location.
here
it
was
at
a
police
station.
who
initiated
the
contact.
here
it
was
initiated
by
the
detective.
whether
the
defendant
voluntarily
came.
here
he
was
brought
by
his
parents
at
the
behest
of
the
detective.
whether
he
was
informed
that
he
was
not
under
arrest.
not
only
was
he
not
informed
of
that,
he
wasn't
given
anything
to
sign
to
say
the
interview
was
voluntarily...
voluntary.
the
length
of
the
interview.
he
was
interrogated
for
over
2
hours.
the
familiarity
of
the
surroundings.
and
this
is
where
his
inexperience
may
go
into
a...
a
circumstances
test.
he
had
never
been
in
a
police
station
or
an
interrogation
room.
and
whether
it
was
communicated
to
him
that
he
was
a
suspect,
which
it
was
certainly
by
comstock--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
it
is
an
objective
determination,
and
nobody
is
arguing
that
it
should
be
subjective.
the
petitioner
is
the
one
who
has
created
this
facade
that
we're
trying
to
turn
an
objective
test
into
a
subjective
test.
we're
not.
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
trying
to
do
that.
no
one
is
asking
whether
michael
alvarado
felt
free
to
leave.
we're
asking
whether
a
reasonable
person
in
his
position
would
have
felt
free
to
leave
because
of
such
factors
as
his
age
and
the
parental
involvement.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
there's
a
fine
line
here.
because
the
custody
test
asks
how
a
reasonable
person
in
the
suspect's
position
would
have
felt
free
to
leave,
it's
saying
how
would
a
reasonable
person
have
felt,
how
they
would
have
felt
free
to
leave.
and
that
sounds
subjective,
but
you're
using
objective
factors.
and
the
fact
of
juvenile
status...
it's
not
subjective.
it's
not
a
state
of
mind.
it's
a
status.
it's
a
class
that
this
court
has
recognized
from
the
beginning.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
in
the
context
of
custodial
interrogations
and
the
fifth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment.
these
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
miranda
is
concerned
with
exactly
the
context
that
this
court
has
recognized.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
i...
i
respectfully
disagree.
we're
not
asking
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
person.
we're
simply
saying
that
this
court
and
other
courts
in
the
land
and
the
police
need
to
recognize
what
is
obvious,
that
juveniles
do
not
assess
their
freedom
to
leave
the
same
way
as
adults
do.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
this
court
in
its
juvenile
jurisprudence
has
drawn
lines
with
juveniles
versus
adults.
when
things
are
close
to
the
line,
it's
going
to
be
fuzzy,
but
to
say
what
the
petitioner
is
arguing,
that
it
never
matters,
that
a
12-year-old
would
assess
their
freedom
to
leave
the
same
as
a
35-year-old,
it
can't
be
true.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
no,
it
wasn't.
the--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--it
is.
the
main
contentions
at
trial
were,
one,
that
the
miranda
wasn't
read
and
he
was
in
custody,
and
two,
that
when
he
said,
can't
somebody
be
in
here
with
me,
that
that
as
a
request
for
counsel.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
no,
no.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
yes,
sure.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
and--
ms.
tara
k.
allen
--i
have
two
things
to
say
about
that,
justice
scalia.
one
is
many
states
do
employ
a
different
miranda
warning
for
juveniles
in
their
statutes.
secondly,
this
court
in
miranda,
when
putting
down
the
warning,
i
assume
it
applies
to
both
juveniles
and
adults,
and
ignoring
the...
the
juvenile
status
is
basically
making
it
an
adult
standard.
if
you're
applying
an
adult
standard
to
juveniles
instead
of
providing
for
the
greatest
care,
you
would
actually
be
giving
them
less
protection
to
which
they're
entitled
under
the
clearly
established
federal
law.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
ms.
tara
k.
allen
sure
you
can,
but
voluntariness
is
retrospective,
and
miranda
is
prospective.
so
if
you're
trying
to
protect
people's
rights
from
the
beginning,
it
should
be
taken
into
account
at
the
beginning
instead
of
waiting
until
the
end
when
it's
too
late
essentially.
it's
very
hard
to
meet
a
voluntariness
test
when
this
could
be
taken
care
of
on
the
front
end
by
police
giving
people
their
15-second
miranda
warnings,
particularly
juveniles
who
they
know
are
going
to
assess
their
freedom
to
leave
differently
than
adults.
so
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions.
