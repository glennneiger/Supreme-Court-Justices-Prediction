we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-1684,
michael
yarborough
v.
michael
alvarado.
ms.
chuang.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
chuang,
there
are
two
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
one
is
what
i
took
it
to
be...
is
the
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
announced
correct
under
our
precedents,
and
the
second,
under
aedpa,
was
it
objectively
unreasonable
for
the
state
court
to
rule
otherwise.
are
you
going
to
address
both
those
questions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
old
was
the
respondent
in
this
case?
17-and-a-half,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
suppose,
in
the
view
of
the
ninth
circuit,
he
would
have
had
to
be
treated
quite
differently
if
he
were
6
months
older,
if
he
were
18.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
what
you're
objecting
to
in
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
the
idea
that
there
is
some
sort
of
a
bright
line
cutoff
date
when
the
person
turns
18?
you
don't
deny
that
a
person
6...
6
years
old
would
be
treated
differently
than
a
17-year-old,
i
suppose,
for
determining
the
objective
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
as
full-blown
as
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank...
thank
you,
ms.
chuang.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
elwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
elwood.
ms.
allen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how...
how
did
the
district
court
know
to
make
a
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
written
petition?
and
what...
what
was
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
finding
or
the
magistrate's
finding?
there
was
no
testimony?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--then
what
is
the
basis
for
the
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
your...
your
argument
is
that
you
think
the
fact
that
he
thought
he
was
a
suspect
would
make
him
less
likely
to
feel
he
was
free
to
leave?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
that
was
not
a
court
opinion,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
citing
it
and
you
don't
know?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
a
plurality
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to...
to
what
extent
do
we
require
a
state
court,
when
we're
talking
about
the
aedpa
rules,
to
be
absolutely
accurate
in
following,
say,
precedent
of
this
court?
i
mean,
i...
i
thought
the
rule
was
that
it
was
up
to
the
other...
the
other
side
to
point
out
how
they
had
departed
from
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say
that
in
any...
every
single
miranda
case,
a
court
must
take
into
account
in
its
opinion
every
single
circumstance
that
is
mentioned
in
the
record?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
what...
why
do
you
say
totality?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
they
have
said
that
the
age
of
a
17-and-a-half-year-old
made
a
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
not
in
this
particular
context.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
up...
up
to
now,
it's
been
concerned
with
respect
to
the
custody
inquiry
to
the
external
circumstances
of...
of
the
person.
you
know,
how
would
a
reasonable
person
have
reacted
to
these
circumstances?
now,
you're...
you're
saying
we
don't
any
longer
limit
it
to
that.
we
look
inside
the
person
and
try
to
figure
out
on
his
background
how
we
would
react,
and
that
of
course,
is...
justice
scalia
says
i
think...
is...
is
not
a...
an
objective
standard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
say
juveniles,
and
you're
saying
the
17-and-a-half-year-old
will
not
assess
his
freedom
to
leave
in
the
same
way
an
18-year-old.
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
allen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1684,
yarborough
against
alvarado
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
