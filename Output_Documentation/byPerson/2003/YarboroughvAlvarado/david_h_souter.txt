justice
david
h.
souter
let...
let
me
ask
you
about
two
facts
in...
in
this
particular
case.
the
first
one
is
this.
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
think
i'm
right
on
these.
when
the...
when
the
sheriff's
department
wanted
to
question
this...
this
young
man,
they
went
to
his
parents
and
the
parents
said,
in
effect,
yes,
we
will...
we
will
bring
him
down
or
take
him
down
with
us,
and
they
took
him
to
the
station,
so
that
as
i
understand
it,
the
sheriff's
department
didn't
ask
him
to
make
a
choice
as
to
whether
they
would
go
down
to
the
headquarters
and
talk
with
him.
the
parents
did
that.
the
second
fact
i
want
you
to
comment
on
is
that
when
they
got
down
there,
the
parents
said,
in
the
boy's
hearing,
can't
we
go
in
with
him
or
can
we
go
in
with
him?
they...
they
made
it
clear
that
they
would
like
to
go
into
this
interrogation.
and
the
deputy
sheriff
said
no,
kept
them
out.
the
sheriff
and
the
boy
disappeared.
are
those
two
facts
relevant
in
making
the
determination
of
whether
he
would
reasonably
understand
that
he
was
being
under...
held
under
conditions
equivalent
to
a
formal
arrest?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
not?
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
wait
a
minute.
you
just
lost
me.
how...
how
is
it
that
he
could
have
said
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
he...
but
he...
he
didn't.
his
parents
said,
yes,
you
can
interview
him.
we
will
bring
him
down,
and
the
boy
came
along.
that's
all
we
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why
is
that?
and
that
is
irrelevant
you
say
because
the
boy
might
have
said,
well,
i
won't
go?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
know
whether
he
would
have
felt
free
to
say
that
or
not,
do
you?
do
we
have
anything
in
the
record
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
is
an
indication.
i...
i
mean,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
the...
the
indication
is
that
he
was
taken
down
to
the
station
house
by
his
parents.
he
didn't
make
the
choice.
and
when
they
got
down
there,
the
parents,
who
wanted
to
be
present
during
the
interrogation,
were
told
that
they
couldn't.
the...
the...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
objective
appearance
of...
of
these
two
facts
is,
number
one,
the
boy
appears
to
be
under
the
control
of
his
parents
and
his
parents
appear
to
be
under
the
control
of
the
sheriff's
department
when
they
get
down
to
headquarters.
and
on
those
two
facts,
i
would
think
it
would
be
difficult...
standing
alone,
those
two
facts,
it
would
be
difficult
to
infer
that
this
boy
would
have
felt
that
he
was
free
to
turn
around
and...
and
walk
out
of
the
interview
and
leave.
and...
and
i
don't
understand
why
those
facts
are
not
relevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
indication
is
that
his
parents
brought
him.
that's
all
we
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
you
just
correct
me
on
the
facts?
i
thought
the...
the
record
indicated
that
the
parents
had
asked
to
go
in,
and
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
that
in
fact
the
boy
at
one
point
said,
you
know,
do
i
have
to
go
alone?
isn't
anybody
coming
with
me?
are...
are...
is
there
testimony
to
that
effect
in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
was
at
the
suppression
hearing.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
did...
did
the
state
object
to
those
facts
as
being
untrue
and
not
in
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
you're
saying
it
was
the
subject
of
evidence
at
one
point,
but
in
a
different
proceeding,
and...
and
when
the
record
of
the
different
proceeding
was
used
here,
no
one
objected
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
counsel,
the...
the
person
to
whom
the
warning
is
given
must
be
found
to
have
waived
the
rights
so
warned
and
to
have
understood
that
a
waiver
was
being
made.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i...
i
think
that's
the
answer,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
question
whether
we're
going
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
the
question
whether
we're
going
to
treat
them
and
prosecute
them
as
adults?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we
don't...
we
don't
do
that
with
6-year-olds.
