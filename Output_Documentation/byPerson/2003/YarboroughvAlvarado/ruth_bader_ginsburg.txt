that
age
is...
you...
you
said
age
is
irrelevant
to
the
custody
determination.
justice

other
things
like
language
is...
language
is
relevant
if
the
person
doesn't...
is
not
conversant
with
english.
justice

do
you
know
any
other
category
where
age
is
ever
and
always
irrelevant,
any
other
category
in
the
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on...
on
your
view
of
this
case,
is
it...
suppose
we
say,
all
right,
reasonable
person
doesn't
mean
16.
could...
would
a
remand
be
appropriate
to
view
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
see
if
they
add
up
to
in
custody
using
the
reasonable
person
standard?

--why
should
it
matter
in
the...
in
the...
why
would
a
court
say,
oh,
yes,
i
know
that
age
could
be...
could
be
relevant,
but
this
was
a
17
and
more...
more
than
17-and-a-half-year-old,
closer
to
18
than
17?
i
think
in
this
case
age
was
irrelevant.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
rather
bad
case
on
the
facts
to
press
the
difference
in
age
of
somebody
who's
almost
18.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
question
i
asked
mr.
elwood
and
he...
his
answer
was
a
remand
wouldn't
be
appropriate
because
what
the
state
court
held
was
a...
was
reasonable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in...
in
what
respect?
