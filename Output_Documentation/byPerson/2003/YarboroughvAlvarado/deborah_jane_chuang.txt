ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
nearly
4
decades,
the
ultimate
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
person
is
in
custody
is
whether
there
is
formal
arrest
or
restraint
in
freedom
of
movement
to
the
degree
associated
with
formal
arrest.
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
that
the
state
court
had
identified
the
correct
legal
standard
for
determining
custody,
that
no
supreme
court
case
had
addressed
whether
age
and
experience
needed
to
be
considered
for
that
determination,
and
that
it
was
borrowing
legal
principles
from
another
area
of
jurisprudence.
yet,
it
held
that
it
was
objectively
unreasonable
for
the
state
court
to
have
abstained
from
innovating
such
a
new
role.
this
case
illustrates
why
federal
habeas
relief
cannot
be
granted
under
28
u.s.c.,
section
2254(d),
when
a
state
court
decision
does
not
extend
supreme
court
precedent
to
a
new
context.
such
relief
is
incompatible
with
the
provisions
of
section
2254(d)
for
three
reasons.
first,
to
require
a
state
court
to
extrapolate
supreme
court
precedents
from
the
voluntariness
context
to
the
custody
context
cannot
be
fairly
characterized
as
applying
this
court's
custody
precedents.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
the
ninth
circuit
fundamentally
changed
the
rule
for
resolving
custody
claims
by
juveniles
and,
second,
federal
law
as
determined
by
the
supreme
court
refers...
is
limited
to
the
supreme
court's
holdings.
the
ninth
circuit
substituted
its
holding
for
that
of
this
court
when
it
recognized
that
this
court
had
never
held
so
in
the
custody
context.
and
third,
to
say
that
an
extension
of
supreme
court
precedent
to
a
new
context
is
clearly
established
law
would
define
clearly
established
at
such
a
high--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--no,
your
honor.
you...
you
would
not.
what--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--well,
because
this
court's
precedence
as
for
custody
determination
has
only
considered
the
circumstances
encountered
by
the
person--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--i
believe
that
the
answer
is
that
the
ultimate
inquiry
for
custody
determinations
is
whether
there
is
a
formal
arrest
or
restraint
in
freedom
of
movement.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
17-and-a-half
years
old
during
the
interview.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
a
6-year-old...
that
age
and
experience
should
be
considered
because
the
test...
the
ultimate
inquiry
is
whether
there
is
a
formal
arrest
or
restraint
in
freedom
of
movement.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
we
don't
deny
that
a
6-year-old
would
certainly
be
more
vulnerable
to
overall
coercion.
yet,
that
is...
overall
coercion
is
addressed
by
the
voluntariness
test
and
really
the
custody
question
is
only
concerned
with
one
aspect
of
coercion
and
that
is
custody.
and
to--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
that
a
blind
person,
if
you
hand
the
blind
person
a
note
saying,
you
are
free
to
leave,
would
not...
you
could
not
use
that
note
as
an
indication
that
he
was
free
to
leave.
you
couldn't
use
that
as
a
circumstance
to
show
that
he
was
free
to
leave.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
yes.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
that's
correct.
age--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--language
might
not
be
relevant,
your
honor,
because...
or...
or
it
might
relevant
because
if
the
person
did
not
understand
english
and
the
officer
said,
you
are
free
to
leave,
that
is...
that
is
a
circumstance
that
the
person
encountered
that
is
within
the
officer's
control
that
the...
and
the
person
doesn't
understand
english,
that
would
be
something
that
could
not
be
relied
upon
later
on
to
show
that
he
was...
he
understood
that
he
was
free
to
leave.
but
then
again,
that
might
not
mean
that
he
could
use
it
to
show
that
he
was
in
custody
as
well.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
they
are
relevant.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
because
once...
again,
if
his...
if
his
parents
were
asked
for
permission
to
interview,
the
detective
had
asked
the
parents
for
permission
to
interview
him,
and
his
parents
said
yes,
the
meaning
of
that
question
was
that
he
could
have
said
no,
and--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--he
could
have
refused
to
have
submitted
to
the
interview,
and
there's
no
indication
in
the
record--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's...
that's
what
we
know.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
that...
yes,
your
honor.
it's--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--there's
no
indication
one
way
or
the
other.
but
there
was
no
indication
that
he
was
not
voluntarily
being
interviewed.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
well,
your
honor,
i...
i...
there's
no
indication,
though,
that
he
was
at
the
station
involuntarily.
certainly
he
came
with
his
parents,
but--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--well,
your
honor,
mr.
alvarado...
it
indicated
in
the
record
that
mr.
alvarado
lived
at
home
with
his
parents
and
that
he
did
not
have
a
car.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
believe
that
custody
by...
custody
in
the
sense
of
a
parental
and
juvenile
situation
is
not
the
same
as
custody
as
you
are
under
formal
arrest
or
restrained
in
freedom
of
movement
to
the
same
degree--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--yes,
your
honor.
well,
first
a--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--yes,
your
honor.
a
juvenile...
unless
the
court
is
willing
to
say
that
the
parents
in
this
case
operated
as
agents
of
law
enforcement
by
bringing
him
into
the
sheriff's
station
and
that
when
the
officer...
the
detective
had
asked
him
if
he...
if
the
parents
would
give
permission,
that
somehow
that
really
wasn't
an
option
that
the
detective
was
giving,
mr.
alvarado
was
not
in
custody.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
no,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
because
as
this
court
alluded
to
in
colorado
v.
connolly
what
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned
with
is
government
coercion,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
parents
brought
mr.
alvarado
to
the
station,
that
is
not
government
coercion.
and
as
far
as
the
parents
not
being
allowed
in
the
interview
room,
there...
mr.
alvarado
actually
did
not
present
any
evidence
that
his
parents
were
not
permitted
into
the
interview
room.
and
indeed,
the
interview
room
door
was
open,
as
indicated
at
joint
appendix
page
150.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
testimony
to
that.
indeed,
it
was
only
argued
by
his
attorney,
but
his
attorney
relied
upon
the
transcript
of
the
interview.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
and--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--well,
the
state
didn't...
no,
your
honor.
the
state
did
not,
but
the...
the
state
was
relying
on
the
fact
that
it
was
the
interview
transcript
that
mr.
alvarado's
counsel
was
using,
and
indeed,
at
the
trial
when
mr.
alvarado
testified,
he
never
stated
that
he
asked
for
his
parents
to
be
in
there,
and
he
had
testified
that
he
didn't
feel
coerced
or--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
his...
it
came
from
his
attorney's
argument
during
the
suppression
hearing.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
in
any
evidence.
and
to
say
that...
to
require
the
state
court
to
extrapolate
from
this
court's
voluntariness
precedents
that
predated
miranda
to
decide
what
types
of
individual
characteristics
needed
to
be
considered
for
a
miranda
custody,
is
not
what
section
2254(d)
requires.
section
2254(d)--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--no.
actually,
your
honor,
it...
yet...
we...
my
position
is
that
a
6-year-old
age
would
still
be
irrelevant.
it
might
be
relevant
for
the
voluntariness
as
to
overall
coercion.
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
that's
correct.
the
california
court
of--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--yes,
your
honor.
in
the
fourth
amendment
seizure
area,
this
court
has
held
that
it's
a
reasonable
person,
and
indeed
in
hodari
d.
v.
california,
this
court
used
the...
the
reasonable
person
standard
without
considering
age.
while
this
court
did
mention
age
in
the
kaupp
case,
which
was
cited
by
mr.
alvarado,
it's
uncertain
to
what
degree
age
actually
was
relevant
for
the
seizure
question,
whether
a
person
felt
free
to
leave.
a
better
reading
of
kaupp
is
that
it
was...
the
court
may
have
mentioned
the
mr....
the
age
of
the
defendant
in
that
case
for
the
voluntariness
of
accompanying
the
officers
to
the
station,
as
this
court
indicated
with
a
citation
of
royer
v....
royer
and
also
schneckloth.
both
of
those
cases
indicate
that
age
does
go
to
the
voluntariness
of
consenting
to
go
with
officers.
the
california
court
of
appeal
in
this
case
identified
the
correct
standard
for
making
a
custody
determination,
and
it
engaged
in
a
reasonable
application
of
existing
custody
precedent.
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
no
supreme
court
case
has
required
age
and
experience
to--
ms.
deborah
jane
chuang
--thank
you.
