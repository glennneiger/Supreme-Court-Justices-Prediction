justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
is
it
a
new
context?
i
mean,
the...
the
rule
was
how
a
reasonable
man
in
the
suspect's
position
would
have
understood
his
situation.
so
is
it
new
to
say
you...
i
mean,
it
might
be
new
if
in
fact
there
was
blind
person
and
the
agent
who
was
holding
him
wrote
on
a
note,
you
are
free
to
leave.
you
know,
he
can't
read
it.
now,
would
you
need
a
new,
special
supreme
court
case
to
say
that's
ridiculous?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
do
you
need
a
new,
special
supreme
court
to
say
a
very
young
person
might
feel
very
differently
about
whether
he's
in
custody
from
a
person
who's
a...
not...
not
a
child
and
not
a
minor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
haven't
considered
blind
people
either.
we
haven't
considered
deaf
people
whom
someone
might
whisper,
you're
free
to
go.
i
mean,
the
point
is
it's
so
obvious
that...
that
being
a
child
or
a
juvenile
would
make
a
difference,
that
you
don't
have
to
write
it
in
all
the
cases.
so
my
question
is,
why
isn't
that
obvious?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
isn't
it?
look,
i'm
not...
i
guess
let
me
try
again
because
i
can
understand
you'd
say
there's
only
6
months
difference
here.
so
in
this
case,
being
a
juvenile
didn't
matter.
but
that's
not
what
you're
talking
about.
you're
talking
about
the
standard
that
says
the
nature
of
a
person
as
a
child
or
an
adult
is
something
that
can
make
a
difference.
all
right?
to
custody.
you
agreed
being
blind
could
make
a
difference
to
custody.
you
agree
being
deaf
could
make
a
difference
to
custody.
why
can't
being
a
child
in
principle
make
a
difference
to
custody?
that's
the
question.
and
it
has
only
to
do
with
whether
the
first
part
of
your
argument,
not
the
second.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
that's
the
whole
point.
that's
why
i
think
justice
souter
asked
that
question,
saying,
look,
you're...
you're
used
to
your
parents
telling
you
what
to
do
and
maybe
even
sometimes
you
do
it.
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
parents
bring
them
down...
bring
him
down.
he
doesn't
think
he
has
any
choice.
he
then
asks
ms.
comstock,
i
guess,
who
was
the
arresting
officer
that
brought
him
in
there,
can
i
take
my
parents
in
this
room.
the
parents
say
we
want
to
go
in
the
room.
and
the
policewoman...
i
think
it
was
a
woman,
wasn't
it?
i
think
she
said
no.
and
they,
who
desperately...
or
certainly
want
to
get
into
the
room,
can't.
so
he's
sitting
there
and
that,
together
with
all
the
other
things
that
are
going
on...
and
there
are
quite
a
few...
would
lead
a
reasonable
person,
who's
used
to
being
under
the...
the
rule
of
his
parents,
to
think,
my
goodness,
this
police
woman
controls
the
situation.
of
course,
i
have
to
do
what
she
says,
and
of
course,
i
can't
leave
until,
as
she
said,
i've
finished
answering
the
question
and
she
can...
tells
me
i
can
leave.
i'm
in
custody.
now,
maybe
an
adult
wouldn't
be
thinking
that.
maybe
he
would.
but
that's
a
reasonable
question.
but
our
standard
here
is,
you
know,
not
whether
they
were
right
in
the
state
but
whether
they
were
reasonable.
but
a
juvenile
certainly
would
be
thinking
that.
that's...
that's
i
think
what
the
point
is.
now,
i'd
like
to
hear
sort
of
a
full-blown
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
not
just
yes
or
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
your
point
is
instead
of
having
a
standard
of
a
reasonable
blind
person,
you
have
a
standard
of
a
reasonable
person
and
one...
in
the
circumstances
and
one
of
the
circumstances
is
that
he's
blind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
and...
and
then
you
say
it
so
it's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
all
that.
i'm
trying
to
get
what
your
objection
is
to
the
standard.
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case
now.
and
is
the
right
way
to
say
it
that
we
don't
apply
a
reasonable
blind
person
test,
we
apply
a
reasonable
person
test
in
the
circumstances,
and
one
of
the
circumstances
is
that
he's
blind.
now,
you
said,
no,
that
isn't
the
right
way.
then
what
is
the
right
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
you
to
say
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
that
i
understand
what
your
statement
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
rt?
it
refers
to
rt
910
as
the
cite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
evidence
or
the
indication
here
that
the
state
did
not
take
account
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
juvenile,
but
having
taken
account
of
it
in
the
state
proceedings,
they
just
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
didn't
in
this
case
matter
that
much?
now,
why
do
we
think
that
that
isn't
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
understand
why
they
might
not...
they
would
mention
things
that
did
matter,
but
if
they
thought
it
hadn't
mattered
here,
why
would
we
have
expected
them
to
mention
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
is
our
only
indication
that
they
didn't
take
it
into
account
the
fact
that
they
didn't
mention
it?
because
maybe
they
didn't
mention
it
because
they
thought
it's
only
6
months.
it
doesn't
matter
that
much.
that
would
be
a
reason
for
not
mentioning
it.
or
maybe
they
didn't
mention
it
because
the
lawyers
then
didn't
make
that
much
of
an
issue
of
it.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why,
when
i
write
an
opinion,
i
don't
mention
things.
usually
it's
because
i
don't
think
it
matters.
