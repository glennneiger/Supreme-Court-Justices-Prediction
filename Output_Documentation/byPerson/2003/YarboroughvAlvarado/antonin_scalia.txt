justice
antonin
scalia
--what...
what
if
he
were
6?
would...
would
you
acknowledge
that...
that
that
factor
should
be
taken
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that
depends
upon
what
a
reasonable
person
in
the
circumstances
would
understand
to
be
his
situation
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
believe
he
was
being
detained.
isn't
that
the
test?
so,
i
mean,
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
help
to
simply
say
that,
you
know,
the
question
is
whether
there's
an
arrest.
yes,
there
is.
that
is
the
question.
but
our
standard
for
whether
there
has
been
an
arrest
is
what
would
a
reasonable
person
believe.
would
he
believe
he
was
arrested?
which
gets
you
right
back
into
the
determination
of
what
a
person
would
believe.
now,
would
we
take
into
account
the
fact
that
somebody
is
6
years
old?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
a
minor,
isn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
to
go
where
his
parents
tell
him
to,
doesn't
he?
isn't
that
what
being
in
the
status
of...
of
a
minor
means,
that
if
your
parents
tell
you
stay
at
home,
you're
grounded,
you're
grounded?
isn't
that
essentially
the
disability
of
being
a
minor?
so
i
guess
maybe
the
proper
inquiry
is
whether
his
parents
thought
that
they
could
let
him
leave
if
they
wanted
to.
either
that's
the
proper
inquiry
or
perhaps
no
minor
can
be
interrogated
in...
in
a
police
station
because
it
always
requires
the
consent
of
the
parents,
and
when
the
parents
tells
him,
you
know,
you
go
be
interrogated,
he
thinks
he
can't
leave.
it's
a
terrible
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--where...
where
did
this
fact
come
from?
it's
in
the
interview
transcript?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
this
fact
or
factoid
come
from
that...
you
know,
that...
that
his
parents
wanted
to
go
in
but
they
were
told
they
couldn't?
where
did
it
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
in
any
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it
was...
it
was
the
subject
of
allegation,
not
of
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
good
does...
does
a
miranda...
i
mean,
you
know...
warning...
what...
what
good
does
it
do
if
you...
if
you
recite
it
to
a
6-year-old?
i
mean,
isn't
it...
isn't
it
really
a...
a
warning
that
is
designed
for
a
reasonable
person,
meaning
a
reasonable
adult?
and
so
that
the
situation
is
as...
as
has
been
portrayed.
it's
just
an
objective
thing
that...
that
the
police
are
supposed
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so...
so
that
even
the
giving
of
a
miranda
warning
would
not
suffice.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
coercion
of
what?
i'm
not
talking
about
coercion,
whether
the
statement
is...
is
coerced.
they
are
not
contesting
that...
that
you
cannot
get
in
the
age
of
the...
of
the
individual
when
it
comes
to
deciding
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary
or
not.
they...
they
agree
that
you
can
for
that.
but
just
for
the
question
of
whether
the
person
was
in
custody
and
therefore
has
to
be
given
a
miranda
warning.
it
seems
to
me
strange
to
say
that
you
take
into
account
for
that
purpose
the
age
of
the
individual
even
though
you
don't
take
it
into
account
for
the
purpose
of
whether
he
can
understand...
can
get
any
benefit
out
of
the
miranda
warning
at
all.
you
recite
a...
a
miranda
warning
to
a
6-year-old.
it's
not
going
to
mean
anything
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
that
means
you
cannot
interrogate
a
6-year-old,
neither
in
custody
nor
out
of
custody.
right?
6-year-olds
just
skip
away.
that
can't
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
they
didn't
mention
that
because
it's
not
in
the
record.
i...
i...
maybe
they
were
being
a
little
more
precise
about
what...
what
should
be
in
their
opinion
than...
than
we
have
been
here
today.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i...
i
didn't...
well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
you're
required...
or
it's
even
proper
to
take
into
account
allegations
that
are
made
in...
in
a
motion
to
suppress
when
there's
been
no
evidentiary
hearing
on
them.
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
not
meeting
their
argument,
though.
their
argument
is
it
doesn't
matter
that
although
voluntariness
of
the
confession
later
on
is
indeed
a
subjective
inquiry,
was
it
really
voluntary
on
the
part
of
this
person,
custody
or
not,
is
not
a
subjective
inquiry.
it
is
purely
objective.
was
this
person
in
custody
or
not
in
custody?
and
their
argument
is
that
determination
is
to
be
made
from
the
standpoint
of
what
a
reasonable
adult
would...
would
deduce
from
the
situation.
it
is
objective.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subjective
feelings
of
the
particular
individual,
whether
because
he's
too
young
or
because
he's...
he's
mentally
not...
not
competent
or
anything
else.
it
is
an
objective
determination.
did
the
police
have
this
person
in
custody?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
is...
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
every
subjective
inquiry
uses
objective
factors.
i
mean,
you're...
you're
not
making
it
non-subjective
simply
because
you
say
whether
it's
a...
you
know,
an
objective
17-and-a-half-year-old
who
had
been
abused
by
his
parents
and
who
was,
you
know,
off
from
sunday
school
or
whatever
and
put
in
every
factor
in
his
life
and
say,
well,
of
course,
you
know.
that...
that's
subjective.
that's
not
an
objective
test
at
that
point
when
you're
using
all
sorts
of
factors
that...
that
go
to
what
his
thinking
was.
when...
when
you
use
all
of
that,
you're
using
the
subjective
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
juvenility
must
be
taken
into
account
for
the
custody
determination,
how...
how
is
it
that
it
is
not
taken
into
account
for
the
purpose
of
what
the
nature
of
the
warning
has
to
be,
assuming
custody?
i
mean,
we
have
one
miranda
warning
that
presumably
i
have
always
thought
is
given
to
everybody
from
the
6-year-old
to
the
senior
citizen.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if...
if,
indeed
as
you
say,
relevant
to
this
whole
thing
is...
is
the
age
of
the
person,
we
ought
to
have
different
miranda
warnings,
an
8-year-old
miranda
warning,
a
17-and-a-half-year-old
miranda
warning,
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
help
your
case
or
hurt
your
case?
i...
i...
i
would
think...
i
thought
that
was
the
argument
of
the
other
side,
that
you...
you
can
raise
all
of
this
on
the
voluntariness
point.
you
don't
have
to
get
it
in
on
the...
on
the
quite
objective
factor
of
whether
there
is
custody
or
not.
