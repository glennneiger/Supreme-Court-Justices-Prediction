mr.
john
p.
elwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
erred
when
it
held
that
a
juvenile's
age
and
experience
must
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
is
in
custody
for
purposes
of
the
miranda
test.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
they
can
be
considered
by
the
court
in
determining
the...
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
interrogation,
just
as
in
oregon
v.
mathiason
they
considered
the
fact
the...
the
person
came
to
the
station
on
his
own
power.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
they
are
facts
that
can
be
considered
by
a...
under
the
reasonable
person
standard
to
determine
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
have
felt
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave
or
rather
that
he
was
under
formal
arrest
at
that
point.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i...
i
think
it's
a...
it's
a
slightly
different
viewpoint
because
i...
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
getting
at.
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
basically
saying
is
that
you
don't
employ
the
reasonable
person
standard.
you,
rather,
employ
a
reasonable
juvenile
standard,
and
you
view
all
the
circumstances
differently.
i
think,
though,
that
you
can
consider
the
fact
that
he...
particularly
the
alleged
fact
that
he...
his
parents
were
excluded
from
the
interview
in
determining
what
a
reasonable
person
would
have
felt
from
that.
unfortunately,
because
it
was
simply
argued
by
his
attorney
at
the
suppression
hearing
and
there
were
no
findings
on
it,
we
don't
know
exactly
how
that
happened.
if--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i...
i...
i
don't...
unfortunately,
i...
i
left
my
transcript
at
my
seat,
but
it
may
be
that
the
defendant
testified
at
the
trial
itself
that
that
is
what
occurred.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
in
any
event,
we
don't
have
any
findings
from
the
state
court
about
what
exactly
transpired.
i
think
that
if
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that's
correct,
that
there
are
no
findings
on
it
and
that
we
have
the
lawyer's
assertion
and
we
may
have...
i...
i
don't
recall...
the
defendant's
own
testimony
at
the...
the
trial
itself.
but
in
any
event,
our
point
with
respect
to
the
exclusion
is
you
have
to
look
at
what...
how
a
reasonable
person
would
view
that,
not
necessarily
a
reasonable
juvenile,
but
a
reasonable
person.
and
if
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--again,
i
think
it
depends
on
how
it
was
put
because
if
they
just
say,
no,
you
may
not
come
in,
i
think
a
reasonable
person
could
conclude
from
that
that
they're
exercising
control
over
the
interrogation
and
that
they...
that
might
extend
to
whether
or
not
he's
free
to
go.
however,
if
it...
the
officer
says
something
more
along
the
lines
of,
no,
we'd
rather
you
not
because
he'll...
he'll
be
able
to
be
more
candid
if
there's
no
one
else
in
there
with
you,
i
think
that
that
would
express
a
very
different--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
it
doesn't
make
a
legal
difference
for
miranda
purposes,
and
that's
our
basic
argument,
is
that
miranda
doesn't...
didn't
develop
a
rule
that
provides
protection
tailored
for
the
specific
circumstances
of...
of
the
person
who's
under
interrogation.
rather,
it's
a
uniform
rule
that
provides
the
same
level
of
protection
for
all
people,
regardless
of
whether
they're
very
experienced
of
inexperienced.
and
i
think--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
they
should
be
treated
the
same
for
purposes
of
the
miranda
prophylactic
rule.
they
should
not
be
treated
differently
for
voluntariness.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
yes,
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
that
traditionally
what
the
court
has
done
is
it
has
viewed
the
circumstances
that
you
look
to,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
as
being
external
to
the
reasonable
person.
i
think
that's
the
inference
you
get
from
thompson
v.
keohane.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
you
don't
consider
that
for
purposes
of
the...
of
the
altering
the
reasonable
person
view.
you
don't
say
a
reasonable
person
of
borderline
competency.
you
can,
i
think,
consider
it
for
different
purposes
like
in
justice
breyer's
example
of
the
blind
person.
one
of
the
very
important
things
to
figure
out
before
you
apply
the
reasonable
person
standard
and
our
basic
objection
to
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
is
it
altered
the
reasonable
person
standard
and
said
it's
a
reasonable
juvenile
standard
when
you're
determining--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--but
one
of
the
reasonable
under
the
circumstances--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it's
not
quite
right,
but
it's
getting
there.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the
point
is
that
one...
one
of
the
important
factors
to
determine
when
you're
figuring
out
what
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
is
that
you
apply
the
reasonable
person
test
to
is
what
police
officers
told
the
person
about
his
freedom
to
leave.
and
if
you--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i...
i
think
that
you
can
consider...
i
think
we
might
be
saying
basically
the
same
thing
but
just
slightly
different--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i'm
trying
to
get--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--is
that
the...
is
the...
is
that
the
person...
you
can
consider
what
the
police
officer
communicated
to
them,
and
when
you're
figuring
out
what
the
police
officer
communicated
to
them,
the
police
officer
doesn't
get
to,
you
know,
pretend
that
a
blind
person
can
see.
they
have
to
take
into
consideration
that
when
you
hand
them
a
written
notice,
they're
not
going
to
see
it,
just
as
though...
just
as
if
you
whispered
it
to
them
in
a
voice
too
low
for
them
to
hear.
the
basic
point
is
that
you
didn't
communicate
anything
to
them.
and
our
objection
to
the
ninth
circuit's
standard
is
they're
trying
to
make
you
view
the
entire
world
through
the
viewpoint
of
a
reasonable
juvenile,
which
means
that
we're
not
talking
about
whether
or
not
the
person
was
unable
to
leave
the
room
when
they
wanted
to
because
they
couldn't
reach
the
doorknob
because
they
were
short.
the
point
is
that
we're
trying
to
infer
something
about
the
way
they
view
the
entire
world
because
they're
a
juvenile.
because
they're
a
juvenile,
they're
more
likely
to
be
submissive
to
authority.
because
they're
a
juvenile,
they're
more
likely
to
feel
that...
that
anything
that
the
police
officer
says
is
a
command.
and
i
think
that
it's
very
different
to
adopt
a
whole
different
world
view
thing
versus
simply
asking
police
officers
to
take
notice
of
things
that
are
objectively
very
plain
or
rather
observable
and
very
plain,
such
as
a
blind
person
cannot
see
the
warning
that
you
give
him.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
basic
difference
between
what
is
permissible
under
the
reasonable
person
test,
as
it
has
always
been
applied,
and
the
ninth
circuit's
innovation
of
it.
now--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
a
remand
isn't
necessary
because
i
think
that
what
the
state
court
of
appeals
did
is
approximately
right,
or
at
least
it's
within
the
range
of
reason.
so,
no,
i
don't
think
that
you
would
need
to
do
that.
now,
if
i
could
get
back
to
one...
one
of
the
questions
that
justice
scalia
asked,
which
was
do
we
apply
the
same
standard
for
a
6-year-old.
and
although
it
may
seem
kind
of
intuitively
wrong,
yes,
we
would
apply
the
same
reasonable
person
standard
that
we
would
to
anybody
else,
with
the
point
being
that
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
require
police
officers
not
only
to
know
that
a
6-year-old
is
more
vulnerable,
but
also
to
know
exactly
where
along
the
continuum
of
custody
versus
non-custody
that...
that
puts
them
because
they
have
to
take
themselves
out
of
their
reasonable
person
mind-set
that
they're
used
to
applying
and
figure
out
how
it
applies
differently
here.
and
i
think
that
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
develop
this
whole
different
kind
of
sideline
to
the
normal
miranda
reasonable
person
test
for
6-year-olds
because
the
very
factors
that
would
make
them
more
likely
to
view
themselves
to
be
in
custody
would
also
make
them
less
likely
to
be
able
to
use
these
miranda
rules
if
they
were
actually...
miranda
rights
if
they
were
given
them.
if...
if
a...
if
a
6-year-old
is
going
to
feel
too
submissive
to
authority,
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
apply
a
lower
custody
threshold
if
then
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
it.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
justice
stevens,
our
point
is
that
basically
we
don't
require
police
officers
to
figure
out
the
mind-set
of
16,
17--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i...
i
think
the...
well,
i've
already
forgotten
what
it
is.
[laughter]
but
i
think
the
point
is--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
if...
in
generalities,
yes,
that's
true,
but
i
also--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--no,
it's
not
relevant
because
i
think
miranda...
we...
because
it's
a
prophylactic
rule,
it's
a
supplemental
protection
in
addition
to
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--voluntariness
test.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
right.
and
our
point
is
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--because
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
just
6-year-olds.
we
have
to
have
a
rule
that
is
workable
for
police
officers
with
respect
to
17-year-olds
and
people
who
are
17
years
and
7
months
and
18
years
and
1
month.
and
when
you...
when
you
can
say
with
some
certainty
that
a
6-year-old
is
going
to
be
feeling
more
vulnerable,
but
you
can't
say
with
a
lot
of
certainty
that
an
average
16-year-old
is
going
to
be
feeling
more
vulnerable
than
an
average
18-year-old,
and
if
so,
by
how
much.
so
that,
for
example,
they
know
that
when
they
say--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--justice...
justice
stevens,
our
point
is
that
it's
not
relevant
because
the
law
says
it's
not
relevant,
that
the
police
officer...
all
they're
accountable
for
is
the
way
a
reasonable
person
would
view
the
circumstances,
and
they
shouldn't
be
required
to
figure
out...
get
inside
the
head
of
a
reasonable
16-year-old,
a
reasonable
15-year-old.
they
just
have
to
apply
one
reasonable
person
standard
to
the
circumstances
that
are
before
them.
