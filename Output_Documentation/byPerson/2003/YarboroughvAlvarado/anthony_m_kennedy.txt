are
these

the

are
those

so
if...
if

it's

justice

all
right.

do
you
agree
that
the
fact
that
the

brought
the
person
to
the
station
and
that
they
were...
requested
to
be
in

room
it...
are...
are
not
relevant
to
the

determination?
justice
anthony

so
that
they
are
relevant
to
the
objective
inquiry
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
person
thought
he
was
under
custody
in
these
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
disagree
with
the
state
on
that
point.
justice
anthony

a
person
of

who
doesn't

language
is...
we
don't
consider
that
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
begins
with
a
prosecution
and
conviction
for
murder.
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
incident
was
about
17-and-a-half
years
old.
he
and
an
accomplice,
another
young
man
by
the
name
of
soto,
attempted
to
take
a
truck.
carjacking
or
truck-jacking
was
the
crime.
they
attempted
to
take
it
from
a
driver
in
the
shopping
mall,
and
in
the
course
of
the
attempted
theft,
soto
shot
and
killed
the
driver.
about
a
month
after
the
incident,
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff’s
department
detective
interviewed
alvarado
at
the
police
station.
alvarado
was
brought
to
the
police
station
by
his
parents.
they
remained
there,
although
outside
the
interview
room.
the
interview
lasted
for
about
two
hours.
during
the
interview,
alvarado
confessed
to
his
participation
in
the
crime.
he
then
left
the
interview
with
his
parents
after
it
was
over.
weeks
later,
alvarado
was
arrested
and
his
statement
was
used
against
him
at
trial.
the
problem,
as
alvarado
sees
it,
is
that
he
was
not
given
his
miranda
warnings
during
the
interview.
the
state
claims
that
miranda
warning
was
not
needed
because
alvarado
was
not
in
custody.
the
california
courts
agreed
with
the
state.
they
found
that
alvarado
was
not
in
custody
so
that
the
statement
was
properly
admitted.
no
ran
relating
was
required
and
the
statement
was
admissible.
the
conviction
was
proper.
the
case
then
went
to
the
federal
system
where
alvarado
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
at
this
point,
the
case
becomes
more
complicated
that
a
mere
discussion
of
whether
the
defendant
was
in
custody.
in
habeas
cases,
federal
courts
are
controlled
by
the
provisions
of
the
federal
statute,
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
known
as
aedpa.
under
aedpa,
a
federal
court
can
set
aside
a
state
court
determination
only
if
the
state
court’s
determination
was
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
in
federal
law
as
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
in
the
habeas
proceeding,
the
united
states
district
court
applied
this
standard
and
found
that
the
california
determination,
that
alvarado
was
not
in
custody,
was
not
an
unreasonable
application
of
federal
law.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed.
we
now
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
determination
was
not
consistent
with
the
review
standard
finding
in
the
federal
courts.
it
can
be
said
that
fair-minded
jurors
could
disagree
over
whether
alvarado
was
in
custody.
and
the
opinion
sets
forth
arguments
that
could
be
made
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
this
issue.
the
problem,
as
we
have
said,
is
that
federal
courts
on
habeas
cannot
undertake
this
determination
as
a
de
novo
matter.
the
state
court’s
decision
fits
within
the
matrix
of
our
prior
decisions
and
does
not
reflect
and
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
law.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
put
great
weight
on
the
fact
that
alvarado
was
under
18
years
of
age
and
that
he
had
no
substantial
previous
experience
with
the
criminal
justice
system.
these
factors
that
set
were
significant
and
concluding
that
he
was
in
fact
in
custody.
we
have
a
different
view.
the
state’s
failure
to
consider
alvarado’s
age
and
inexperience
did
not
provide
a
basis
for
concluding
that
the
state
court’s
decision
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
law.
as
the
opinion
for
the
court
today
notes,
our
cases
applying
the
miranda
custody
test
have
not
mentioned
the
suspect’s
age,
much
less
mandated
its
consideration.
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
the
argument
that
the
custody
inquiry
states
an
objective
rule
designed
to
give
clear
guidance
to
the
police
and
that
age
and
inexperience
are
subjective
factors.
for
these
reasons,
the
state
court’s
failure
to
consider
alvarado’s
age
does
not
provide
a
proper
basis
for
finding
that
the
state
court’s
decision
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
law.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
he
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
ginsburg.
