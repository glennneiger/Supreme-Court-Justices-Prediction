mr.
e.
king
poor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
single
question:
can
the
deadline
for
objecting
to
a
bankruptcy
discharge
be
altered
by
equitable
exceptions?
to
answer
that
question,
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
rules.
bankruptcy
rule
4004
states
that
an
objection
to
discharge
must
be
filed
no
later
than
60
days
after
the
first
date
set
for
the
meeting
of
creditors.
this
rule
also
allows
for
an
extension
of
the
time,
but
only
by
motion
and
only
if
that
motion
is
filed,
quote,
before
the
time
expires.
mr.
e.
king
poor
and
i...
and
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
the
question
of
waiver,
or
sometimes
referred
to
as
forfeiture,
is...
is
part
of...
that
is
the
question
that's
before
your
court,
whether
that...
the
fact
that
we
had
not
raised
it
until
some
later
date
is
something
that
can
be
waived
or
forfeited.
mr.
e.
king
poor
no,
your
honor.
we
raised
it
in
march
of
2000
in
a
motion
to
reconsider,
but
we
also
have
maintained--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--correct,
but
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
we
have
steadfastly
maintained
that
we
raised
it
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
that
we
specifically
said
that
the
family
account
claim
was
not
in
the
original
complaint,
and
that
to
be
timely,
a
claim
had
to
be
in
that...
that
original
complaint.
now--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
your
honor,
we
have
maintained
that
we
did
and
in
the
context
of
this--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
we
did
as
best
we
could
at
the
time
because
this
was
part
of
a--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--yes.
mr.
e.
king
poor
yes,
we
believe
we...
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
king
poor
not
specifically
as
to
that,
and
that's...
and
that's
what
the...
what
the
bankruptcy
court
found.
however,
at
the
time
this
was
part
of
a
mass
of
other
allegations,
and
we
felt
that
we
had
raised
it
sufficiently
by--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
we
felt
that
that
was...
at
the...
in
the
opposition
we
raised
the
4004
untimeliness
issue.
there
were
just
a
number
of
others
that
were
not
even
in
the...
any
complaint.
mr.
e.
king
poor
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
king
poor
well,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
this
deadline
is
very
much
unlike
a
classic
statute
of
limitations
where
you
have
a,
say,
a
2-year
statute.
this
is
different
because
here
the
language
of
the
60
days
is
modified
or
altered
by
bankruptcy
rule
4...
9006(b).
the
rulemakers
didn't
stop
with
the
60-day
deadline.
they
stated
that
this
rule
will
be
incorporated
into
a
special
subgroup
of
other
rules
that
may
only
be
extended,
quote,
to
the
extent
and
under
the
conditions
stated.
mr.
e.
king
poor
well,
it...
any...
any
attempt
to
excuse
a
late
filing,
whether
it
is
waiver,
equitable
estoppel,
and
it
could
be
waiver
in
the
sense
of
it's
an
implied
waiver
where
a
debtor,
by
inaction,
does
not
raise
it,
or
it
could
be
a
situation
where
there's
a
stipulation
by
the
debtor
to...
with
the
creditor
and
says,
after
the
deadline
the
creditor
goes
to
the
debtor
and
says,
i
want
you
to
stipulate
to
a
late
time
period.
in
the
language
here,
if
you
take
the
plain
language
of
4004
and
9006(b),
that
plain
language
simply
does
not
allow
for
any
type
of
equitable
exceptions,
whether
they're
deemed
to
be
waiver
or
forfeiture
or
if--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--you...
and
that's
correct,
your
honor,
for
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations.
this
one
is
different
for
this
reason,
that
the
presumption
here
is
that
when
the
drafters
adopted
9006,
what
they
did
was
they
patterned
it
after
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
6(b),
almost...
almost
virtually
identically,
and
the
language
of
6(b),
on
which
9006(b)
is
patterned,
has
had
a
long
history
of
being...
had
an
established
meaning
as
setting
jurisdictional
deadlines
and...
for
its
own
subgroup
of
rules,
and
those
rules,
as
this
court
held
in
the
robinson
case,
we
must
presume
that
rules
that
are
based
on
that
6(b)
rule
are
presumed
to
be...
to
have
the
same
meaning,
that
is,
in
the
words
of
the
robinson
case,
as
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
mr.
e.
king
poor
not
in
the
least,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
distinction
in
this
case,
because
i
think
that's
where
the
court
below
got
off
the
trail
in
focusing
on
the
concept
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
this
case
does
not
deal
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that's
the
idea
that...
whether
the
court
has
the
competency.
we're
not
saying
that
the,
for
instance,
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
was
the
proper
court
to
hear
this
objection.
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
an
entirely
different
concept,
and
that
is
jurisdiction
used
in
the
sense
that
a
court
may
not
extend
a
deadline
beyond
the
plain
meaning
of
the
rule
with
any
type
of
equitable
exception,
whether
it's
called--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--i...
and
i...
i,
your
honor,
and
as
i
recall
in
your
honor's
concurrence
in
the
carlisle
case,
you
pointed
out
that
to
use
the
term
subject
matter
jurisdiction
for
something
like
this,
for
a
time
prescription,
is...
is
anomalous,
where
in...
in
this
case
if
we're
not...
we're
not
dealing
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
we're
talking
about
jurisdiction
as
a
shorthand
for
a
time--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--exactly,
and
i...
i
know
there
are
a
number
of
courts
that
decline
to
even
use
the
term
jurisdiction,
because
they
think
that
that's
probably
not
the
best
term
to
use.
it's
used
by
many
courts.
mr.
e.
king
poor
correct.
mr.
e.
king
poor
i
think,
so
long
as
it's
within
the
same
proceeding,
your
honor,
you
could,
and
that's...
that
was
the
holding
in
the
kirsch
case,
which
the
seventh--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--i
think
that
that
would
probably
be
a
rare
instance,
but
i
think
that
in...
if
it
is
jurisdictional
or
unalterable,
then
so
long
as
it's
within
the
same
proceeding
that's
just...
that
is
part
of
what
a
jurisdictional
rule
is.
mr.
e.
king
poor
we
have
cited
a
number
of
those,
your
honor,
in
our...
both
our
opening
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
and
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
king
poor
yes,
and...
and
even
more
extreme,
a
more
extreme
example,
if
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
dollar
case,
where
after
the
time
limit
had
passed,
the
creditor
went
to
the
debtor
and
says...
said
i
want
you
to
extend
the
time
limit,
and
for
whatever
reason,
the
debtor
said,
okay,
i'll
agree
to
that,
and
then
they
brought
that
to
the
bankruptcy
court
for
approval
and
the
bankruptcy
court
said,
no,
this
is
a
jurisdictional
time
limit,
you
can't
have
a
side
deal
with
a
creditor--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
there...
there
are
a
number
of
them
where
they're
not
raised
in
the...
there's
a
whole
spectrum.
they're
not
raised
in
the
answer--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--yes.
the
kirsch
case
is
one
case
where
it...
actually
after
trial,
in
kirsch,
the
court
found
that
since
the
rule...
and
i...
it
was
not
alterable
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
twin
here,
this
4004,
4007,
that
that
could
not
be
altered,
even
after
a
trial,
and
as
i
recall,
the
poskanzer
case
is
yet
another
one
of
those
where--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--the...
the
kirsch
case
is
from
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
and...
and
the
poskanzer
case
is
from
new
jersey
and
we
cite
a
number
of
them
in
page
16
and
in
our
footnote
on
that--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--that--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
your
honor,
the...
to
go
back
to
the...
the
concept
of...
of
waiver
or...
or
forfeiture,
if
the
rule
is...
is
truly
jurisdictional,
using
the
shorthand
that
it
cannot
be
altered,
then--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--but
if...
if
the
rule
itself,
for
instance,
does
not
allow
a...
a
debtor
and
a
creditor
to
extend
this
time
line
themselves,
then
it
would
be,
i
submit,
anomalous
to
allow
the
debtor
to
do,
by
inaction,
what
the
court
could
never
do
on
its
own
or...
or
permit
a
rule
that
says
that--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
if
it
can
be
forfeited,
your
honor,
then
i
would
submit
that
it
can
also
be
waived.
it
could
be...
and--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--a
day--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--right.
mr.
e.
king
poor
well,
i...
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
cases
that
we
cite
on
pages
16
and
17,
such
as
the...
the
rinde
case,
debtor
failed
to
plead--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
i
can...
i
can
point
the
court
to
a
case
that
is
in
that
6(b)
family,
in
the
criminal
rule
45(b).
mr.
e.
king
poor
and--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--and--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--and
in--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
i
would...
i
would
invite
the
court
to
the
kirsch
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief.
mr.
e.
king
poor
in...
in
kirsch,
the
court
relied
upon
that
6(b)
analysis
in
a
case
called
hulson
from
the
seventh
circuit,
where
just
such
a
thing
happened
where
after
the...
after
trial
the...
the
party
did
not...
did
not
file
his
rule
59
motion
on
time
and
actually
the
other
side...
they
stipulated
to
an
untimely
rule...
they
stipulated
to
it,
and
then
on
appeal
in
that
case
they...
the
seventh
circuit
said,
we
don't
care
if
you
stipulated
to
it,
it's
untimely
and
you
cannot--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--that's
hulson,
h@l
u@l
l@l
s@l
o@l
n@l.
mr.
e.
king
poor
and
that's...
and
that
was
the
basis...
that
was
the
basis
of
this
whole
analysis
in
the
kirsch
case.
mr.
e.
king
poor
relation
back
has
never
been
in
our--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--he...
he
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
king
poor
well--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--that's
correct,
that
we...
we...
we've
never
argued
the...
there's
never...
the
relation
back
issue
was
never
before
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
e.
king
poor
if
they...
they
raised
it
on
appeal,
as
it
might
be
a...
an
issue.
i
think
it's
probably
more
likely
in
the
trial
court,
but
yes,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
e.
king
poor
that
is
true,
your
honor,
both
in
taylor
and
carlisle
it
was
raised,
but
i
would
suggest
that
in
taylor,
if
the
court
did
not
allow
a
late
extension
based
upon
a
bad
faith
claim
of
exemption--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--and--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
they
do
in
a
broader
sense,
your
honors,
that
they
do
not...
i
would
submit
that
they
do
not
allow
any
kind
of
equitable--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--that's
correct.
mr.
e.
king
poor
and
that...
what
that
gets...
what
that
gets
back
to
our
point
in
our
brief
that
in
the
santos
case
that
the
seventh
circuit
relied
upon
most
heavily
here,
they
did
what
i
would
call
a
pick
and
choose
of
different
type
of
equitable
exceptions.
in--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
in--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
our...
our
biggest
point
here,
your
honor,
is
that
either
these
rules
set
time
limits
that
cannot
be
altered
by
any
type
of
equitable
doctrine,
be
it
forfeiture,
waiver,
or
equitable
estoppel,
i
mean,
either
all
of
those
are
in
or--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
i...
i
guess
in
this
case
we've
always
talked
about
waiver
as...
as
what
we're
talking
about
here
in
terms
of...
it
was
an
implied
waiver
in
terms
of...
it
was
inaction...
inaction
by
the
debtor--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if...
a
tolling
type,
and
i
think
that's
what
we're
getting
at
here
is
are
there
tolling-type
exceptions
to
this
language
and
i
come
back...
we
come
back
to
the
point
that
if
this
rule
was
designed
by
the
rulemakers
to
track
the
language
of
6(b)
and
not
allow
any
type
of
exception,
whether
it's
equitable
tolling
or...
or
whatever,
then
either...
either
all
those
exceptions
come
in
or
they...
or
they
don't,
because--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--and--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--and
i
would...
the
hulson
case
is
an
excellent
example.
mr.
e.
king
poor
no,
it's
in
the...
the
kirsch...
the
kirsch--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--that's
correct.
mr.
e.
king
poor
yeah,
but...
and
the...
the
other
point
i
would
make,
though,
is
that
the...
the
overall
concept
here
is
this
case
is
really
no
different
than
the
carlisle
case
in
that
if
the
claimant
carlisle,
one
day
late,
or
the...
the
motion
one
day
late
could
not
be
extended
because
of
attorney
error--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--but
the...
the
question,
your
honor,
is...
i
would
come
back
to
this:
could
the
government
waive
the...
the
objection
deadline
in
45(b)?
and
i
think
the
answer,
and
i
think
this
is
where
this
all
comes
together,
all
of
this
comes
together
in
this
point,
is
that
the
government
could
not
waive
that
45(b)
deadline,
and
that
45(b)
deadline
is
the
same
as
6(b)
and
it's
the--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--if
there
are...
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
if
these...
if
these
deadlines
are
such
that
they
may
not
be--
mr.
e.
king
poor
--well,
it
dealt
with
the
idea
it
was
their
inherent
power
to
do
that,
but
if...
if
the
court
allows
a
rule
that
says
the
government
can
waive
this
or
the
government
can...
if
the
government
can
stipulate
to
it,
which
is,
in
effect,
a
waiver-type
argument,
then
i
think
that
that
pretty
much
unravels
carlisle.
if
the
government
is
able
to
stipulate
to
a
late...
a
late
time
period
by
either
action
or
inaction,
then
i
think
that
unravels
carlisle
and
all
these
6(b)
family
of
cases.
mr.
e.
king
poor
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
e.
king
poor
i'd
like
to
return
to
the...
the
fundamental
point
is
when
these
were
adopted,
9006(b)
was
patterned
after
6(b),
and
that
identical
language,
as
this
court
instructed
in
the
robinson
case,
should
be
read
to
be
mandatory
and
jurisdictional,
that
is,
not
waiveable.
and
if
we
look
at
a
case
like
santos,
there's
nothing
in
the
language
that
allows
santos
to
pick
and
choose
between...
between
saying
equitable
estoppel
would...
would
not
apply
but
waiver
would
apply.
the
only
possible
way
you
can
get
there
in
santos
is
not
through
the
text,
not
through
the
language,
which
robinson
has
told
us
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
the
only
way
you
can
get
there
is
through
the...
a
policy
argument
that
says,
we
think
it's
a
good
idea
not
to
have
equitable
estoppel,
but
on
the
other
hand,
yeah,
for
policy
reasons,
we...
we
should
allow
waiver
to
apply.
and
if
you
allow
waiver,
whether
it
is
waiver
in
the
implied
sense
of
inaction
or
waiver
in
the
express
sense
of
allowing
a
stipulation,
in
that
case,
you
will
have
really
taken
what
is
in
the
text
and
these
are
no
longer
jurisdictional
rules
without
exception.
rather,
they
have
become
rules
that
the
parties
themselves
may
change,
and
this
deadline
has
never
been
like
a
statute
of
limitations.
it
has
always
been
different.
it
allows
the
parties
to,
before
there's
any...
before
there's
any
adjudication,
any
deadline,
to
take
discovery
and
move
the
deadline
along.
that's
not
like
a
typical
statute
of
limitation,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
text.
the
text
says
it
may
only
be
extended
to
the
extent
and
under
the
conditions
stated,
the
exact
language
that
was
at
issue
in
carlisle
and
in
robinson,
and
we
would
submit
that
you
have
to
read
the
same
language
in
the
same
way,
whether
it's
9006(b),
6(b),
criminal
rule
45(b),
they
all
are
based
on
the
same
language.
