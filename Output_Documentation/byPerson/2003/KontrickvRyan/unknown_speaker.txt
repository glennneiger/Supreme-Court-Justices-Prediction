unknown
speaker
mr.
poor,
may
i
suggest
that
the
question
you
have
raised
is
not
the
one
that
i
understood
this
case
to
involve.
it's
not
whether
the
provision
allows
for
equitable
exceptions,
it's
whether
you
forfeited
that
claim,
the
claim
that
it
does
not...
whether
you
forfeited
it
by
letting
the
thing
go
past
your
answer.
you
didn't
raise
it
in
your
answer.
you
let
the
case
go
off
on
summary
judgment
on
the
merits
and
remained
silent
until
after
there
was
an
adverse
judgment
against
you.
so
at
least
in
my
thinking,
the
forfeiture
question,
whether
you
forfeited,
the
argument
that
you
would
now
like
us
to
treat
as
the
question
presented,
that
is
the
threshold
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
poor--
--i...
i
would
agree
with
justice
ginsburg
that
that's
the
way
that
the
question
reads
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
it's
helpful
that
you
did
set
forth,
that
the
parties
did
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix
the
chronology
here.
i
take
it
that
the
first
time
your
client
raised
the
late
filing
issue
was
june
23,
2000,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
that
was
in
the
motion
to
reconsider?
unknown
speaker
but
in
that
very
pleading
you
asked
the
court
to
strike
a
number
of
things
in
the
complaint,
and
yet
you
did
not
ask
to
strike
the
family
account
claim.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't...
did
you
expressly
say
that
you
wanted
those
certain
allegations
struck?
unknown
speaker
did
you...
did
you
say,
court,
strike
these
allegations?
unknown
speaker
yes,
the
answer
is
yes?
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
not
say,
strike
with
respect
to
this
allegation?
unknown
speaker
what
was
your
reason
for
distinguishing
the
two,
for
saying
strike
others,
but
as
to
this
one
all
that
you
did
was
mention
that
it
wasn't
in
the
original
complaint?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we're
going
to
get
into
all
of
that,
then
they
would
say
there's
a
relation
back
and
none
of
those
issues
are
really
before.
we
took
the
issue
on
the
pure
question
of
whether
or
not,
assuming
that
you
were
late
in
objecting
that
that...
that
that's
a
bar.
unknown
speaker
mr.
poor,
there
are
cases
with
which
i'm
sure
you're
familiar
where
a
statute
of
limitations
has
been
held
to
be
deemed
waived,
even
though
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
talking
about
waiver.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
much
like
that,
is
it
not?
there's
a
provision
in
the
rules
for
a
deadline
for
making
a
claim,
but
perhaps
as
in
a
statute
of
limitations
case,
it's
not
an
extension
of
time
to
find
a
waiver.
it's...
it's
a
different
concept,
and
maybe
should
be
viewed
much
like
a
waiver
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
but
what's
your
answer
to
the
argument
that
a
waiver
is
not
an
extension,
it's
a
waiver?
that's
a
different
kettle
of
fish.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
make
the
same
argument
for
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations
that
doesn't
talk
about
waiver
or
equitable
alteration.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
rule
4004(a)
limits
the
court's
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
pin
the
word
jurisdiction
on
it
at
all
when
rules,
whether
bankruptcy
rules
or
creditor
rules,
cannot
alter
or
affect
the
court's
jurisdiction?
that's
what
both
rules'
enabling
acts
say,
so
whatever
it
is,
it...
if
it
is
jurisdiction,
then
it
violates...
the
rule
violates
the
statute.
the
rule
isn't
passed
by
congress.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
a
rigid
time
limit,
a
time
limit
that
cannot
be
extended
for
good
cause.
unknown
speaker
could
you...
could
you
have,
according
to
your
analysis
of
what
this
animal
is,
here
you
made
your
motion
to
reconsider
after
the
summary
judgment
motion
was
granted,
but
before
judgment
was
entered--
unknown
speaker
--final
judgment
was
entered.
suppose
final
judgment
had
been
entered.
could
you
then
come
into
the
court
and
say,
sorry,
court,
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
you
couldn't
enter
any
judgment
here
because
an
unalterable
time
bar
had
passed?
unknown
speaker
how
about
initially
on
appeal?
suppose
you...
you
suffered
the
adverse
judgment
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
then
you
want
to
raise
that,
after
all,
the
complaint
was
untimely,
on
appeal
for
the
first
time?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
authority
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
rule,
a
rigid
time
limit,
that
it's
okay
to
untimely
bring
that
to
the
court's
attention?
i
mean,
all
the
precedent
that
your
brief
cites
are
cases
where
the
party
who
opposes
the
time
extension
timely
brings
up
that
the
complaint
was
untimely.
unknown
speaker
where
the
defendant
was
untimely...
that--
unknown
speaker
--where
as
here?
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
case
where
the
court
made
an...
an
initial
ruling
without
having
expended
any
time
in
adjudicating
the
case.
here,
you
present
the
situation
where
the
court
grants
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
then
the
debtor
says,
sorry,
court,
you
never
should
have
adjudicated
this.
we
didn't
tell
you,
but
now
you
have
to
erase
all...
everything
that
you
did.
unknown
speaker
i
did...
was
not
aware
of
such
a
case.
unknown
speaker
raised
after
the
case
is
adjudicated
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
who
made
those
decision
where
the--
unknown
speaker
--the...
the
law...
like...
like
the
time
limit
here,
the
law
is
unalterable,
and
if
you
fail
to
make
a
legal
argument
at
the
trial
level,
you're
not
normally
permitted
to
raise
that
argument
on
appeal
where
you
haven't
raised
the
objection
below.
unknown
speaker
the
court...
the
court
doesn't
say,
well,
the
law
is
unalterable
so
you're
entitled
to...
to
raise
this
point
at
any
stage
in
the
proceeding.
that's...
that's
just
not
the
way
we
do
things,
and
that's
why
we
do
have
this
terminology
jurisdictional.
there
is
something
special
about
that,
but
the
mere
fact
that
something
is
unalterable
certainly
doesn't
allow
you
to
raise
it
whenever
you
like.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
that
was
the
point
of...
of
my
question.
it
is
not
a
synonym
for...
for
the
term
jurisdictional
that
it
can't
be
altered.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that...
that
can't
be
altered
which
you're
not
allowed
to
raise
late.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that's
like
saying
you
cannot
let
the
defendant
change
the
law
by
merely
failing
to
raise
a
legal
objection
that
was
fully
available.
he's
not
changing
the
law,
he's
just
forfeited
the...
that...
the
benefit
of
that
provision
of
law.
unknown
speaker
what's...
what's
the
citation
of
that?
i
mean,
you
refer
to
rule
6,
and
rule
6
governs
a
whole
lot
of
famous
time
limits,
new
trials,
60(b)
motions,
et
cetera.
so,
therefore,
there
must
be
a
lot
of
cases
where
the
following
thing
happened:
somebody
made
a
motion
under
rule
59,
or
whatever
it
is,
out
of
time,
all
right,
a
day
late--
unknown
speaker
--a
day
late.
unknown
speaker
and
then
nobody
said
a
word
about
it.
then
one
year
later,
for
the
first
time
on
appeal,
the
other
side
says,
oh,
i
agree
we
never
said
a
word
about
this
before
so
we're
raising
it
now
for
the
first
time,
and
the
court
said,
fine,
you
can
raise
it
for
the
first
time.
now,
what
are
the
cases
that
hold
that?
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
there
aren't
any,
i
haven't
faced
this
before,
but
i
would
have
thought
it
comes
up
million...
you
know,
quite
a
lot
of
times
where
people
forget
to...
or
they
don't
care
or
whatever
it
is,
and
they
raise
something
very
late.
what
are
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
bankruptcy.
i'm
talking
about
rule
6,
ordinary
civil
cases.
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
civil
rules
of
procedure,
ordinary
civil
cases.
probably
there
are,
i
would
guess
conservatively
100,000
cases
a
year
that
may
fall
into
this
category.
in
a
certain
percentage
of
those,
the
deadlines
will
be
missed--
unknown
speaker
--and
in
a
certain
percentage
of
that
percentage,
the
other
side
will
have
said
nothing--
unknown
speaker
--waking
up
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
and
then
there
must
be
a
lot
of
cases,
if
you're
right,
that
would
say,
that's
okay.
i'm
just
repeating
myself
because
i
think
there
are
no
cases
and
i
think,
to
me,
that
shows
you're
wrong,
but
now
i'm
open
to
hearing
that
there
are
a
lot
or
even
one.
unknown
speaker
is
kirsch
a
bankruptcy
case?
i'm
not
talking
about
a
bankruptcy
case.
district
court...
that's
a
district
court
case.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
that
would
definitely
support
you,
and
what's
the
name
of
that
case?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
under
your...
your
view
of
the
law,
could
the
respondent
here,
the
creditor
have
argued
that
this
amendment
relates
back
to
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
could
he...
could
he
have
made
that
argument
under
your
view
of
the
law,
post-judgment,
after
you...
march
2000,
it
was
decided
in
1980...
90...
99,
march
2000,
you
object.
at
that
point,
could
the
creditor
say,
oh,
well,
this
relates
back,
it's
okay?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
then
what
you're
doing
is
you're
putting
this
issue
potentially
in
the
appellate
courts.
we
don't
do
that
sort
of
thing.
it's...
it's
for
the
trial
judge
to
say
it
relates
back
or
not.
unknown
speaker
and
that's...
that's...
you
put
all
of
the
parties
in
a
very
difficult
position
by
your
rule.
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
said...
say
you
didn't
suggest
that
it
related
back,
therefore,
they're
assuming
it
didn't?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
saying
it
is
before,
but
i'm
saying
under
your
view,
under
your
framework,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
handle
that
at
such
a
late
point,
and
it's
a
legitimate
argument
that
they
could
have
made.
unknown
speaker
mr.
poor,
i'm
still
looking
for
that
case
that
you
cited,
because
at
least
the
two
cases
that
you
relied
on
principally,
taylor
and
carlisle,
those
were
both
cases
where
the
untimeliness
point
was
timely
raised.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
rule
says
good
faith
isn't
an
excuse,
so--
unknown
speaker
--but...
but
you
are
arguing
that
an
untimely
raising
of
the
lack
of
timeliness
is
okay,
and
neither
carlisle
nor
taylor
stand
for
that
proposition.
unknown
speaker
they
were
both
cases
where
the
objection
to
the
untimeliness
was
timely
made,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
then
they
could
not
have
considered
the
case
such
as
this
one
where
the
objection
is
untimely
made?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
that
forfeiture
was
an
equitable
exception.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
difference
between
waiver,
which
is
a
conscious
act,
and
forfeiture,
which
is
rule
that
says,
if
you
don't
raise
the
point,
which
is
the
ordinary
consequence
of
not
raising
a
defense,
if
you
don't
raise
it
and
the
time
to
amend
passes
and
you
have
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
you
can't
go
back
to
square
one
and
said,
oh,
sorry,
i
should
have
put
it
in
my
answer,
but--
unknown
speaker
--i
didn't
think
that
forfeiture
was
an
equitable
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're...
you're
talking
about
the
same
thing
as
implied
exceptions
to
the
statute
of
limitations
that,
you
know,
the
statute
may
have
run
but
there
are
certain
exceptions
where
the
thing
will
still
be
considered.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
you
cite
only...
in
response
to
justice
breyer,
you
cite
only
one
6(b)
case
that
you're
aware
of
that
applied
the
principle
you're
arguing
for
here,
namely
that
a
late-raised
objection
will...
will
be
heard,
right?
it
isn't
an
exception.
the
point
is,
i
think
some
of
us
have
been
pointing
out
to
you,
is
our
belief,
which
you
could
try
to
disabuse
us
of,
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
exceptions.
we'll
assume
there
are
no
exceptions
no
matter
what,
but
there
can
be
a
rule
of
law
that
you
win
and
there
are
no
exceptions,
but
still,
because
you
didn't
raise
the
point,
you
lose
it.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
exceptions.
it
has
to
do
with
the
normal
rule,
in
a
court
you
have
to
raise
a
point.
now
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
what
i
wonder...
i'm
asking
because
rule
6,
i
think,
would
be
analogous
to
that
and
so
if
you...
there
are
some
cases--
unknown
speaker
--which
case?
because
i'm
looking
for
it
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
cited
by
another
case,
right?
unknown
speaker
it's
cited
in
kirsch?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
poor,
it
can't
be
like
carlisle
because
the
government
timely
made
that
objection.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
government
had
said
nothing
and
the
court
had
said,
i
considered
this,
i
grant
the
motion
to
acquit,
that
the
government
could
then
come
in
and
say,
oh
sorry,
we
forgot
to
tell
you
that
this
was
one
day
late
and
so
you
couldn't
consider
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the...
the
opinion
of
this
court
certainly
doesn't
give
any
basis
for
that...
for
such
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
do
you
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
your
time,
mr.
poor?
unknown
speaker
very
well.
mr.
figliulo
we'll
hear
from.
unknown
speaker
mr.
figliulo,
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
an
objection
could
be
waived
and
yet
prior
to
the
time
of
waiver,
the
parties
could
not,
by
stipulation,
eliminate
the
objection?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--that...
that
holds
what?
you...
you
think...
you
think
the
parties
can
waive
the
limitation
of...
of
4004?
unknown
speaker
the
parties,
if
they
get
together,
can
waive
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
i
have
trouble...
i
have
trouble
with
that.
unknown
speaker
i
can't
imagine
that...
that
you're
unable
to,
by
stipulation,
agree
to
eliminate
it,
but
you
can...
one
of
the
parties
can
nonetheless
waive
it.
that...
that'd
be
a
very
unusual--
unknown
speaker
--it
can
be
waived.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
what's
his
case
is
wrong...
what
was
the
name
of
the
one
that--
unknown
speaker
--and
was
that
a
case
in
which
the...
in
which
the
court
expressly
addressed
the
issue
and
say...
and
said,
i'm
not
going
to
allow...
i'm
not
going
to
permit
the
extension
of
time?
unknown
speaker
that...
that's...
that's
far
different
than
just
a
waiver.
unknown
speaker
there
the
judges
said,
you're...
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
to
delay
the
processes
of
this
court,
and
that's
quite
different
than
parties
simply
doing
it
on
their
own
without
the
judges'
intervention.
unknown
speaker
i...
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
saying
now.
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
think
in
barley,
when
the
parties
signed
an
agreement
to
extend
the
time
limit,
the
court
should
have
accepted?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree...
do
you
agree
with
the
government
that
if
the
statute
in
question,
not
the
bankruptcy
rule,
but
at
157(b)(2)(j),
if
that
required
timely
objection
as
some
other
statutes
in
the
bankruptcy
realm
do,
then
you
would
lose,
if
the
statute
rather
than
the
rule
required
timely
objection?
unknown
speaker
well,
many...
many
statute
of
limitations
are,
of
course,
enacted
by
the
legislature
rather
than
by
rule,
and
nonetheless
you
have
tolling
there,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
in
the
typical
case
there's
not
a
whole
bunch
of
people
who
are
hanging
on
the
resolution
of
this
issue.
i
mean,
what's
involved
here
is,
i
mean,
it...
it
says
no
later
than
60
days
after
the
first
date
set
for
meeting
of
creditors.
the
problem
is
you
have
a
whole
bunch
of
people
who
don't
know
what
their
rights
are
going
to
be
until
this
matter
is
settled
and
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
it's...
it's
quite
reasonable
to
insist
upon
compliance
with
that
time
limit
no
matter
what,
because
there
are
other
people's
interests
involved.
unknown
speaker
but
are
you--
--except...
except
that
it
does
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
they
should
be
able
voluntarily
to
agree
to
extend
the
time
period,
which...
which
is
a
position
you
support?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
would
you...
would
you
agree
that
a
district
court
could
override
that
determination
of
the
parties,
say
i'm
not
going
to
allow
the
late
filing?
other...
the
rights
of
other
persons
are
involved
and
the
district
court
in
the
hypothetical
case
says,
i
know
this
is
not
jurisdictional
but
it
is
within
my
control.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
difference
between
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
case
we've
got
here
that
in
the
statute
of
limitations
case
we
make
the
assumption
that
the
only
two
interested
parties
are
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant,
and
if
they
don't
care,
why
should
anybody
else?
in
this
case,
however,
there
are
other
interested
parties
and
there
is
a
pretty
well-articulated
governmental
interest
in
wrapping
this
up
quickly.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
in...
in
the
bankruptcy
case,
the
court
would
have
every
reason,
if
it
was
brought
to
its
attention,
e.g.,
in
the
form
of
a
stipulation,
to
say,
no,
i'm
going
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
fast.
isn't
that
the
distinction?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
maintain
that.
[laughter]
why
don't
you
recognize
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
this
is
simply...
the
question
is
essentially,
where
does
one
draw
the
line?
and
one
might
say,
even
if
the
objection
to
the
timeliness
isn't
raised
in
the
initial
answer,
it
could
be
raised
in
an
amendment
to
the
answer.
it
could
even
be
raised
in
opposition
to
the
summary
judgment
motion.
but
there
comes
a
point
where
it's
too
late
to
make
that
objection,
and
that's
essentially
the
question
for
us:
where
do
you
draw
the
line
when
it's
too
late?
now,
it
could
be
on
appeal,
it
could
be
after
adjudication
on
the
merits
in
the
trial
court.
so
on
that
question
of
where
do
we
draw
the
line
about
raising
this
objection,
what
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
all
you
have
to
maintain
to
prevail
here?
unknown
speaker
i
have
one
question
of
bankruptcy
practice.
you
just...
you
can
tell
me
how
it
works.
is
the...
is
the
order
for
the
first
meeting
of
creditors,
which
is
what
triggers
the...
the
time
limit
here,
is...
does
that
date
often
fluctuate
the...
the
order
of
the
first
meeting
of
creditor
and
then
they'll...
and
then
they'll
change
it?
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
timely
complaint
filed
and
it
is
a
little
odd
that
it
was
never
argued
that,
well,
this
is
really
within
the...
within
the
frame
of
the
original
complaint,
so
it...
it
should
relate
back.
why
didn't
you
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
if
you're
through
i'd
like
to
ask
you
an
irrelevant
question.
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time.
i
noticed
judge
schwartz
ordered
a
special
hearing
on
sanctions
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding.
what
happened
at
that
hearing?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
it
was
a
pretty
acrimonious
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
is
your
view
on
this
as
a
bankruptcy
attorney
thinking,
i
mean,
i
don't
see
that
it
affects
your
client
one
way
or
the
other,
but,
i
mean,
obviously
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
has
suggested
an
affirmance
on
the
very
narrow
ground
that
maybe
they're
quite
right
about
what
the
rule
should
be
interpreted,
but
still
they
lost
the
chance
to
raise
the
rule
because
they
didn't
raise
it.
all
right,
that's
a
very
narrow
ground.
on
the
other
hand,
the
split
in
the
circuits
is
more
on
the
broader
question
of
how
absolute
are
these
rules
in...
how
absolute
are
the
deadlines
in
this
particular
rule,
and
that's
a
broader
question,
which
is
also
a
possible
ground
for
affirmance,
so
either
way
your
client
would
win.
but,
as
a
bankruptcy
lawyer,
what's
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
a
problem
then
about
the
other
part
that
says
you
can't
extend
the
deadlines
in
this
main
part
except
for
the
reasons
that
are
there
given,
which
is
good
cause,
et
cetera,
what
do
we
do
about
that?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
a
cause
for
tolling
if
excusable
neglect
is
out
of
it?
it
seems
to
me
that
this
rule
is
saying
there
are
no
exceptions,
period,
and
to
say
that
even
if
you
can
show
good
cause
you
don't
get
it
extended,
but
there's
some
other
equitable.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
excusable
neglect?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
figliulo.
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
when...
at
what
point
in
that
spectrum
would
it
have
been
tiled
permissible
to
allow
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
is
it
too
late
to
amend
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
now
wait,
do
you
mean
judgment
is...
is
determined,
or
judgment
is
entered?
unknown
speaker
well,
quite
frequently,
does
it
not,
at
pre-trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
at
this
stage
of
the
case,
judgment
had
not
yet
been
entered,
but
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
had
been
granted.
you...
are
you
saying
it
can
never
be
done
at
that
stage?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you...
how
do
you
reconcile
your
view
about
the
court
having
such
broad
discretion
with...
with
the
wording
of
4004(b),
which
says
that
on
motion,
the
court
may
for
cause
extend
the
time,
but
the
motion
shall
be
filed
before
the
time
has
expired?
and
what
you're
saying
is,
well,
it
really
doesn't
matter,
the
court
has
discretion
to
go
ahead
even
though
the
motion
wasn't
filed
before
the
time
has
expired.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
you're
distinguishing
between
granting...
i'm
sorry...
granting--
unknown
speaker
--granting
a
late-raised
objection
and
granting
a
late-filed
complaint?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
rule
on
amendment,
which
the
pleading
rules,
the
federal
rules
would
apply,
says
that
it
should
be...
if
after
you
miss
the
time
limit
in
which
you
are
allowed
to
amend
as
a
matter
of
right,
then
you
may
or
may...
and
with
the
court's
permission,
and
leave
shall
be
freely
given
when
justice
so
requires.
unknown
speaker
at
the
outset
you
said
there's
a
text-based
or
a
rule-based--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
4000(e)?
unknown
speaker
4004(e)?
unknown
speaker
where
is...
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
was
that
in...
did
you
make
that
argument
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
this
is
a
totally
different
issue
and
it's
a
much
broader
issue
and
more
important--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
think,
in
other
words,
if
they
had
come
in
and
said,
hey,
we...
i've
been
taking
all
the
money
out
of
wife's
account,
putting...
put
it
in...
you
know,
i
put
it
all
in
her
name,
ha
ha
ha,
and
i
had
hired
people
to
prevent
the
creditor
from
ever
finding
out,
that
then
the
correct
defense
there
would
be
equitable
estoppel,
which
is
an
enlargement
of
the
time
period?
unknown
speaker
i'm...
i'm
assuming
they
acted
very
inequitably.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
see,
that...
that's
the
argument
the
other
way.
the
argument
the
other
way
is
you
don't
really
need
to
import
these
defenses
into
the
rule
itself
because
there
are
other
ways
in
the
bankruptcy
law
that
an
unfair
kind
of
conduct
that
can
be
dealt
with.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kent,
as
i
remember
the...
this
case
itself,
the
debtor
was
never
secretive
about
what
he
had
done.
he
told
the
creditors,
he
told
everybody,
yeah,
i
took
my
name
off
the
account--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
continued
to
deposit
my
salary
in
it,
i
continued
to
pay
the
family
expenses
from
it.
it
wasn't
concealed.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
hypothetical
case.
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
issue
the...
that's
bothering
me.
can
you
just
give
me
one
word
about
whether
my
belief
about
the
rule
6...
it
refers
to
a
new
trial
motion
in
a
civil
case,
motion
to
amend
the
opinion,
jnov,
all
those
time
limits
it
says
are
absolute.
now,
i
take
it
it's
never
been
held
or
isn't
at
least
normally
held
that
a
lawyer
can
sit
there,
notice
that
the
time
limits
weren't
complied
with,
wait
to
see
if
he
wins,
and
then
if
he
loses,
bring
it
up
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
am
i
right
about
that?
because
they're
saying,
no,
i'm
not
right
about
it.
unknown
speaker
is
it...
do
you
know
of
any
case,
mr.
kent,
because
those
are
all
motions
that
are
brought
after
the
trial,
after
the
adjudication,
and
i'm
can't
imagine
a
scenario
where
a
lawyer
who
won
would
then...
and
the
other
party
moves
for
a
new
trial...
would
then
say
nothing.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
poor,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
