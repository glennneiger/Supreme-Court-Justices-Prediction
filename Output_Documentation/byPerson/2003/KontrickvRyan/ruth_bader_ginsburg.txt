justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case,
which
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
involves
a
question
of
time.
the
setting
is
a
chapter
7
bankruptcy
proceeding.
key
to
our
decision
is
the
distinction
between
laws
determining
a
court's
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
in
other
words,
laws
defining
the
kinds
of
cases
courts
are
authorized
to
hear,
and
rules
of
a
lesser
order
governing
the
processing
the
claims
in
court.
the
underlying
controversy
involves
a
bankrupt
debtor,
dr.
andrew
kontrick
and
his
principle
creditor
and
former
partner
in
plastic
surgery,
dr.
robert
ryan.
ryan
objected
to
an
order
that
would
discharge
kontrick
from
his
debt,
in
fraud
of
creditors,
ryan
complained,
kontrick
had
converted
a
husband-wife
joint
bank
account
into
an
account
in
his
wife’s
name
only
thereafter
kontrick
continued
to
deposit
his
salary
checks
into
that
account
and
use
the
funds
not
to
pay
creditors
but
to
cover
everyday
family
living
expenses.
bankruptcy
rule
4004
gives
creditors
a
60-day
period
to
object
to
a
debtor’s
discharge.
the
rule
allows
one
time
extension
but
only
if
the
creditor
asks
for
the
extra
time
before
the
initial
60-day
period
expires.
ryan
missed
the
initial
60-days
and
did
not
ask
for
an
extension.
kontrick,
nevertheless,
answered
ryan’s
claim,
litigated
the
question
whether
the
name
change
and
the
bank
account
defrauded
creditors
and
lost
on
the
merits.
after
that
loss,
kontrick
urged
the
time
bar.
he
said
he
could
do
so
however
late
the
date
because
bankruptcy
rule
4004's
time
prescription
is
jurisdictional
and
therefore,
a
matter
that
could
be
raised
even
after
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
the
courts
below
held
that
rule
4004
is
not
jurisdictional
and
therefore,
could
not
be
invoked
to
nullify
the
decision
in
ryan’s
favor.
we
granted
certiorari
because
other
courts
have
held
that
rule
4004's
time
prescription
is
jurisdictional.
rule
4004
we
now
affirm
is
not
jurisdictional.
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts,
the
cases
those
courts
can
hear
and
decide
maybe
prescribed
only
by
congress.
congress
prescribed
that
objections
to
discharges
fall
within
the
bankruptcy
court’s
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
congress
built
no
time
constraint
into
that
statutory
authorization,
instead
the
time
limit’s
relevant
here
are
contained
in
rules
and
procedure
for
bankruptcy
courts.
those
rules
do
not
delineate
what
cases
bankruptcy
courts
are
competent
to
adjudicate.
they
are
simply
plain
processing
rules.
in
arguing
that
rule
4004
should
have
the
same
practical
effect
as
a
statutory
provision
governing
subject
matter
jurisdiction
contract
overlooks
this
critical
difference.
characteristically,
a
court’s
subject
matter
jurisdiction
cannot
be
enlarged
to
account
for
the
party’s
litigation
conduct,
but
a
claim
processing
rule
even
strict
one
like
bankruptcy
rule
4004
can
be
forfeited
if
the
body
invoking
the
rule
waits
too
long
to
raise
a
point.
no
reasonable
construction
of
complaint
processing
bankruptcy
rule
4004
would
allow
a
litigant,
in
debtor
kontrick's
shoes,
to
defeat
a
claim
as
filed
too
late
after
the
litigant
has
lost
on
the
merits.
a
prime
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
afford
the
bankrupt
debtor
and
affirmative
defense
to
a
complaint
untimely
filed
by
a
creditor.
kontrick
raised
no
such
defense
when
he
answered
ryan’s
complaint.
kontrick
additionally
argues
that
rule
4004’s
time
constraint
is
so
tight,
it
allows
no
recourse
to
equitable
exceptions
but
ryan
never
maintained
that
he
qualified
for
an
equitable
exception.
therefore,
we
do
not
address
the
question
whether
rule
4004
accommodates
equitable
exceptions.
the
sole
question
we
decide
is
one
of
forfeiter.
under
the
governing
claim
processing
rules,
the
defense
is
lost
if
it
is
not
included
in
the
complaint
or
in
an
amended
answer.
only
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
objection
lingers
on
beyond
the
pleading
stage.
kontrick's
post-adjudication
assertion
that
ryan’s
claim
was
untimely
is
not
of
that
extraordinary
order.
in
sum,
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
we
hold
that
a
debtor
forfeits
the
right
to
rely
on
rule
4004
if
the
debtor
does
not
raise
the
rule's
time
limitation
before
the
bankruptcy
court
reaches
the
merits
of
the
creditor’s
objection
to
discharge.
the
court’s
decision
is
unanimous.
