mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
very
little
to
add
to
what's
already
been
said
because
basically
what's
been
said
by
respondent
is
our
view
as
well,
which
is
that
this
is
a
question
of
waiver,
not
a
question
of
enlargement
or
extension
of
the
time
to
file
a
timely
complaint,
and
the
one
thing
i
do
want
to
add,
though,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals,
it
seems
to
us,
correctly
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
rules-based
answer
to
the
waiver
question
as
well
as
the
general
principles
that
we
have
articulated.
the
rules-based
answer
is
alluded
to
by
respondent,
which
is
the
rule
4004(d)
expressly
incorporates
through
part
7
of
the
bankruptcy
code
the
pleading
requirements
of
8(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
now,
that
means
that
the...
the
debtor
has
an
obligation
to
plead
his
affirmative
defenses
at
the
answer
or
they
would
be
treated
as
waived.
this
was
an
affirmative
defense,
and
so
just
by
applying
the
rules
it
was
subject
to
waiver
when
it
was
not
raised
in
the
answer.
we
think
the
court
was
right
in
exercising
its
discretion
to
determine
that
when
it's
not
raised
until
after
the
trial,
or
in
this
case
after
summary
judgment
was
entered,
it's
plainly
too
late,
and
it
was
waived.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
broad
answer
to
that
question...
well,
the
first
answer
is,
that's
not
been
raised.
they've...
they've
suggested
it
can't
be
waived,
not
that
the
court
abused
its
discretion.
the
answer
to
your
question,
though,
is
that
it's...
if
it
would
not
be
too
late
to
amend
the
answer,
then
it's
not
forfeited
or
waived.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's...
there's
a...
a
whole
body
of
precedent
about
that,
and
as
respondent
correctly
says,
it's
clearly
too
late
once
the
judgment
has
been
determined.
if--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
this
case
judgment
was
announced
after
the
trial.
i...
let
me
back
up.
i
think
that
it's...
the
court
retains
discretion
to
allow
an
amendment
up
to
the
pre-trial
stage.
up
to
the
pre-trial
answer,
the
court
sometimes
allows
complaints
to
be
amended
in
its
discretion,
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--not
infrequently,
but
it's
also
the
case
that
sometimes
amendments
are
denied
at
that
point
because
of
the
particularity,
facts
of
the
case.
but
my
point
is
simply,
at
this
stage
of
the
case
it's
clearly
have
been
waived
and...
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
would
be...
i...
i
think
that
it...
it
might
be
not
an
abusive
discretion...
there's
a
lot
of
nots
there.
a
court
might
be
able
to
exercise
discretion
if
it
thought
in
the
circumstances
it
was
appropriate,
but
it
is
a
matter
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
and
certainly
at
that
stage
it
was
well
within
its
discretion,
and
again,
that
issue
hasn't
been
presented
or
raised.
what
was
raised
is
the
idea
you
can't
waive
it,
and
the
reason
that
it
was
raised
in
that
fashion
is
they
said
it's
jurisdictional.
but
it's...
but
they've
conceded,
both
in
their
reply
brief
and
in...
and
in
court
today,
that
it
doesn't
affect
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
and
the
cases
are
clear
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
the
question
that
i
was
answering
was
whether
the
court
had
discretion
to
accept
the
late-raised
objection
to
the
late
complaint.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
that's
a
different...
and
i
do
think
the
court
has
that
discretion.
whether
it
had...
would
have
had
discretion
to
allow
a
late
complaint
at
that...
at
some
later
point
really
isn't
before
the
court,
because
they
haven't
claimed
that
there
is
any
equitable
grounds
for
enlarging
or
extending
the
deadline,
so
that
question
isn't
presented.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
under
ordinary
principles
of
8(c)
and
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
which
are
applicable
here.
my
point
is
that
a
court
could
allow
the
late-raised
defense
that
it...
that
the
complaint
was
untimely,
up
to
some
point
it
would
have
discretion
to
do
that,
but
it
exercised
its
discretion
not
to
allow
that
late-raised
objection,
late-raised
defense
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
the
discretionary
standard
and
i
don't...
i
will
be
frank,
i
do
not
know
if
there's
a
case
that
says
that
discretion
stops
at
this
point.
that's
not
before
the
court.
it
would
just
be
odd
for
the
court
to
exercise
such
discretion
after
it
had
already
determined
that
the
judgment
should
be
awarded
to
one
of
the
parties.
that's
all
i
was
trying
to
say.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
rule-based.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
4004(b).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
b.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
at--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
did
not
make
that
argument.
the
respondent
made
the
argument
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
the
point.
that
provision
is
quoted
in
footnote
3
of
respondent's
brief.
it's
a
very
short
provision.
it
just
says
that
the...
the
procedures
of
part
7
will
have
governed,
and
then
rule
7008
says
that
incorporates
rule
8(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
now,
we
have
not
addressed
the
question
of
whether
equitable
exceptions
would
be
available
under
this
rule,
but
we
do
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
the
santos
case
provides
a
sensible
explanation
of
how
to
address
that
question.
in
santos,
the
court
made
the
point
that
the
rules
appear
to
say
you
cannot
extend
by
excusable
neglect,
but
that
doesn't
preclude
equitable
estoppel,
because
estoppel
is
based
on
the
misconduct
of
the
debtor,
excusable
neglect
is
the
neglect
of
the
creditor.
so
not
allowing
an
extension
for
neglect
doesn't
preclude
allowing
an
extension
for
estoppel.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
this
is
a
much...
this
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
the...
if
i
understood
your
hypothetical,
if
the
basis
of
the
estoppel
was
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
we
were
unable
to
find...
they
hid
from
us
what
they
were
doing--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
i
think
that
would
apply.
but
i
should
also
point
out
that
in
that
specific
factual
scenario,
727(d)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
would
allow
the
discharge
to
be
reopened
in--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
other
ways
to
deal
with
it,
then
equity
doesn't
need
to
step
in
if
there's
an
adequate
legal
remedy.
but
if...
when
there's
not
an
adequate
answer
in
the
code
to
this...
to
whatever
facts
come
up
about
the
estoppel
situation,
we
would
think
that
the
rules
don't
preclude
the
court--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
a
hypothetical--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i...
i
think
you're
right
about
that
that
you
can
waive
an
argument
of
any...
based
on
those
rules
in...
in
the
trial
court,
but
let
me--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not
familiar
with
a
case
of
that
type,
but
there...
i
can
imagine
that
there's
a
case
out
there
that
says
something
along
the
following,
that
this
court's
jurisdiction,
by
statute,
is
based
on
the
requirement,
for
example,
that
there
be
a
notice
of
appeal
filed
within
30
days.
