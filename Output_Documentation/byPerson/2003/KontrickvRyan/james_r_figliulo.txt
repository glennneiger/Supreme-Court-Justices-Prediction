mr.
james
r.
figliulo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
best
way
for
me
to
understand
this
case
is
just
to
walk
through
the
case.
this
is
a...
an
adversary
proceeding.
rule
4004
deals
with
the
time
for
filing
a
complaint
objecting
to
discharge,
and
that
specifically
is
provided
as
an
adversary
proceeding.
once
we
move
into
the
realm
or
the
arena
of
an
adversary
proceeding,
the
rules
are
pretty
clear.
if...
if
the
complaint
is
late,
the
plaintiff
runs
the
risk
of
losing
his
case
if
the
defense
is
timely
raised,
but
there's
obligations
that
shift
to
the
defendant
once
we're
in
the
adversary
proceeding.
the
defendant
has
to
answer--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--there's
a...
a
bankruptcy
case
that
holds
that,
but
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
think
the--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i
think
you
can't
agree--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i
believe
they
can,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
yes,
i...
i
believe
they
can.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
and
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--here...
here's...
here's--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i
think
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
personal
defense
and--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--therefore,
it
can
be
waived,
and
there's
tolling
agreements
that
are
entered
into
regularly--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--with
respect
to
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--and
i
think
it
could
apply
to
4004(a)
as
well.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
i
think
it
was
barley,
in
re
barley,
your
honor.
i
think
that
case
said
that
the
stipulation
was
not--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i
think
that
was.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
i
do
understand.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
the
rule,
like
rule
6(b)
or
9000(6)(b)
focuses
on
motions
for
extension
and
enlargement
and
it
is
strict
and
it
does
provide
the
guidelines
for
the
court
to
follow,
but
i--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--well--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i
believe
that,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
but
i
think
the
court...
the
reason
in
the
court,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
they
could
not
agree
to
do
that
because
extensions
and
enlargement
of
time
is
governed
by
the
rule
and
that
it
wasn't
permitted
by
the
rule.
but
in
this
case
i
think
we
have
a
classic
situation
where
we
have
a
limitations
period
that's
the...
it
should
have
been
raised
in
the
answer.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
answer.
it
wasn't
raised
until
after
the
court
granted
summary
judgment.
that's
a
classic
case
of
an
implied
waiver
of
a
limitations
defense
and
the
court
recognized
that
at
the
bankruptcy
level,
it's
been
recognized
that
way
at
the
district
court
level,
it's
been
recognized
that
way
by
the
seventh
circuit,
and
it's
a,
i
think,
100
percent
right.
it's
also
directly
in
accord
with
the
background
principles
of
waiver
that
apply
to
any
civil-type
action.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
i
think
if
the
statute
provided...
if
section
157
provided
timely,
like
it
does
for
abstention,
i
think
that
would
make
the
rules
more
of
an
exercise
of
the
code
and
perhaps
a
stronger
basis
for
arguing
the
mandatory
strictness
of
the
rules.
i
do
not
think
it
would
make
it
jurisdictional.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
exactly,
your
honor.
in
fact,
traditionally,
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
from
time
to
time,
that
statute
of
limitations,
which
are
phrased
in
mandatory
terms,
are
silent
with
respect
to
whether
certain
exceptions
or
defenses
traditionally
apply,
but
regularly
apply
those,
and
that
would
apply
particularly
here
where
the
bankruptcy
court
is
a
court
of
equity,
and
waiver
is
one
of
those
principles.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
your
honor,
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
the
time
limit
is
important
and
it
serves
a
valid
purpose,
but
when
we
look
at
waiver...
and
we're
not
talking
about
exceptions
to
extend
time
here,
we're
looking
at
the
defendant's
objection
to...
to
assert
a
timely
objection
to
the
untimeliness
of
the
complaint.
that
promotes
banality
because
that
brings
the
issue
to
a
head
and
it...
it
conserves
judicial...
it
does
everything
waivers
should
do.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
it's
a
position
i
support
but
it's
not
critical
to
the--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--position
that
we
advocate,
but
i
do
think
it's
right,
because
i
do
think--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i
think
the...
the
bankruptcy
court
level,
that
probably
would
be
within
the
court's
discretion,
but
i...
my
view
is
that
it's...
it's
like
a
tolling
agreement
and
it
should
be
permitted,
because
a
statute
of
limitations
or
a
limitations
period
is
a
personal
defense.
now,
if
there's
extraordinary
circumstances
where
the
court
refuses
to
enforce
the
agreement,
i
can't
conceive
of
why
that
would
be
permitted.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
sound
distinction.
i...
i
happen
to
believe
that
dischargeability
is
a
complaint
for
objecting
to
dischargeability
primarily
affects
the
objecting
party
and
the
debtor,
and
while
there
may
be
other
rights
of
people
implicated,
it's
still
very
personal
with
respect
to
the
debtor
and
the
creditor
who's
making
the
objection
to
discharge.
and
that
would
also
be
even
more
true
with
respect
to
dischargeability
of
particular
debts
as
in
4007.
so
i
understand
the
policy
consideration,
there
is
a
distinction
there.
i...
i've
probably
bitten
off
more
than
i
should
have
with
respect
to
whether
that
can
be
agreed
on
or
not--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--but
i
do--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i
know
that
in
this
case,
once...
once
the
court
adjudicates
the
merits,
it
is
waived,
it's
over,
it's
too
late.
i
would--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i
do
believe...
i
do
believe
that
whether
there's
been
an
implied
waiver
or
a
waiver
has
some
of
a
fact
inquiry
that's
necessary.
it
can
be
as
early
as
the
failure
to
raise
it
in
the
answer,
but
i
do
recognize
the
liberal
rules
of
amendment
to
answers
and
that
may
be
permitted
it
by
the
court
in
its
discretion,
so
it's
not
a
bright
line
before
judgment,
it's
not
bright
line
where
you
draw
the
line,
in
my
judgement,
but
in...
and
certainly
once
the
court
rules,
it's
too
late.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
no,
that...
it's
pretty
set,
your
honor.
that...
it
can
happen,
but
that's
unusual.
the
date
is...
the
set...
there's
notice
that
goes
out
and
it's
a
relatively
fixed
point
in
time
from
which
these
deadlines
then
are
calculated.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
your
honor,
that
was
argued
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bankruptcy
court
did
not
discuss
it
at
all
in
its
opinion.
it
was
argued
before
the
district
court.
it
wasn't
discussed
by
the
district
court
at
all.
my
client
represented
himself
pro
se
before
the
seventh
circuit.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
briefs
on
appeal,
so
with
respect
to
whether
that's
an
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance,
that's
been
waived,
somewhat
ironically,
but
i
think
it
has
been.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
your
honor,
i
wasn't
involved
at
that
time.
my...
my
understanding
is
that
there
was
a
lot
of
stuff
going
back
and
forth
and
there
was
a
sanction
of
attorneys'
fees
of
$1,000
or
$1,500
assessed.
that's...
that's
what
my
recollection
is.
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
it...
it
was,
your
honor.
it's
former
partners
and
we
know
that--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--my...
and
i
approach
this
with
little
trepidation,
but
i
believe
equitable
exceptions,
the
traditional
equitable
exceptions
of
tolling
and
equitable
estoppel,
continue
to
apply
and
should
apply
to
rule
4004(a)
and
4007.
i
don't
think
they've
been
expressly
abrogated.
i
think
they're
such
a
powerful
part--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i...
i
think
the...
the...
rule
9006(b)
or
6(b),
it
eliminates
excusable
neglect
as
a
grounds
for
extending
time
for
a
late-filed
motion,
but
i
don't
think
it
eliminates
equitable
tolling.
i
think
it's
different.
i
think
tolling
and
excusable
neglect
overlap
some
cases,
and
to
the
extent
it's
excusable
neglect,
it's
not
grounds
for
extension,
but
a...
a
true
tolling--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i...
it's
a
relatively...
i
think
equitable
tolling,
in
the
context
of
this
rule,
is
relatively
narrow
exception,
it's
not...
it's
little
broader
than
the
unique
circumstances
that
relate
to
if
a
party's
misled
by
a
rule
of
court.
but
i
do
think
that
it
can...
there
can
be
circumstances,
for
example,
if
a
client's
lawyer
dies
right
before
the
deadline
is...
passes,
and
there's--
mr.
james
r.
figliulo
--i
don't
think
it's
neglect.
i...
i
think
there's
equitable
tolling
and...
and
that...
that's
why
i
do
think
it
survives
in
some
way,
but
i...
it's
not
critical
to
our
position.
our
position
is
waiver.
i
think
we're
classically
correct.
it's
approached
under
the
adversary
proceeding
rules,
which
engage
all
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
we
all
know
about,
it's
a
familiar
arena,
and
it
should
apply
as...
as
it
has
been
applied
by
the
lower
courts,
and
i
ask
that
this
court
affirm
it.
thank
you
very
much.
