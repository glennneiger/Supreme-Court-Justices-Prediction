mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
court
reaches
the
second
question
presented
in
this
case,
the
united
states
submits
that
the
confrontation
clause
should
be
properly
construed
to
be
limited
to
testimonial
statements
and
their
functional
equivalent,
but
it
should
not
be
an
absolute
bar
against
the
admissibility
of
that
kind
of
statement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
o'connor.
we
took
the
same
position
with
respect
to
the
limitation
of
the
clause
to
testimonial
statements
in
white
v.
illinois,
and
this
court
rejected
that
submission
by
a
7
to
2
vote.
we
renewed
it
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
court's
grant
of
certiorari
on
the
second
question
presented
in
which
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
this
court
has
too
broadly
construed
the
confrontation
clause,
but
within
its
compass,
it
should
be
given
an
absolute
prohibition.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
court
has
said
it
about
the
confrontation
clause--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
a
variety
of
contexts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
starting
from
the
overall
structure
of
the
sixth
amendment,
the
court
has
construed
many
of
the
rights
in
the
sixth
amendment
not
to
be
absolute
in
certain
contexts.
the
jury
trial
right
does
not
extend
to
all
criminal
prosecutions
as
the
language
of
the
constitution
would
provide.
it
does
not...
the
right
to
counsel
does
not
extend
to
every
criminal
case
in
which
a...
arguably
the
text
would
require.
the...
the
compulsory
process
clause
has
been
held--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
this
court
has
said
about
the
confrontation
clause
is
that
it
incorporated
a
preexisting
common
law
right
that
had
common
law
exceptions
with
it,
and
those
common
law
exceptions
were
capable
of
growing
and
being
developed
along
the
lines
of
analogous
principles.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
not
an
absolute
guarantee.
what
helps
to,
i
think,
explain
that
is
to
look
at
what
confrontation
involves.
it
involves
having
a
witness
who's
under
oath,
who
is
subject
to
cross-examination,
who's
demeanor
can
be
observed
by
the
jury,
and
who
is
brought
face
to
face
with
the
accused.
now,
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
that
all
or
some
of
those
components
of
confrontation
may
be
dispensed
with
when,
in
the
necessities
of
the
case
and
in
order
to
obtain
witness...
witnesses
who
will
be
able
to
testify
at
the
trial,
it
is
required
to
do
so.
for
example,
in
the
instance
of
former
testimony,
you
have
oath,
cross...
and
cross-examination,
and
you
have
at
one
point
the
defendant
face
to
face
with
the
witness,
but
you
do
not
have
the
important
confrontation
right
of
the
jury
having
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
demeanor
of
the
witness.
and
the
court
held
that
that
is
required
because
the
necessities
of
the
case
require
overcoming
what
would
otherwise
be
a
confrontation
right.
similarly
in
maryland
v.
craig,
the
court
held
that
the
literal
face-to-face
right
to
confront
the
witness
may
be
overcome
by
the
necessities
of
the
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
it's
definitely
not
what
we're
saying,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
define
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
confrontation
clause--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
serve
the
truth-seeking
mission
of
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
doubt
seriously
that...
that
sir
walter
raleigh's
case
would
come
out
differently
under
our
approach.
what
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
witnesses
were
available,
justice
breyer,
in
walter
raleigh's
case.
and
our
position
on
the
availability
of
witnesses
is
that
when
they
are
available,
they
should
be
brought
in.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
oh,
definitely
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
view
of
inadi
is
that
the
statements
of
co-conspirators
made
to
each
other
out
of
court
in
connection
with
the...
with
the
conspiracy
are
almost
invariably
non-testimonial
statements.
there
may
be
a
few
rare
instances
in
which
the
co-conspirators
are
continuing
the
conspiracy
and
speaking
to
law
enforcement,
and
in
that
context,
in
the
unlikely
event
that
the
united
states
submitted
that
those
statements
were
coming
in
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted
and
not
because
they
were
false,
then
perhaps
there
would
be
some
issue
about
our
approach.
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
was
no
suggestion
in
the
lower
courts
that
these
two
individuals
were
attempting
to
further
the
conspiracy
or
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
going
on
at
the
time
of
the
statements.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's...
these...
these
statements
were
admitted,
justice
souter
and
justice
o'connor,
as
statements
against
penal
interest.
and
the
basis
for
the
state
court
decision
in
letting
them
in--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
the...
the
confrontation
clause--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
hearsay
basis
was
statement
against
penal
interests.
the
confrontation
argument
that
was
accepted
by
the
washington
supreme
court
was
that
the
confession
of
sylvia
crawford
interlocked,
which
meant
that
it
overlapped
and
paralleled
the
confession
of
michael
crawford--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
do
not
endorse
that
position,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
statement
should
have
been
excluded,
justice
kennedy.
it...
first
of
all,
we
think
that
under--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--under
roberts--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
under
roberts,
as
explicated
in
idaho
v.
wright,
corroborating
evidence
that
serves
to
show
the
reliability
of
a
particular
statement
is
not
an
acceptable
means
of
vindicating
its
admission
under
the
confrontation
clause.
i
can
think
of
only
two
possible
reasons
why
the
confession
of
the
defendant
when
it
interlocks
with
the
statement
made
out
of
court
might
be
treated
differently,
and
neither
of
those
arguments
seems
to
me
to
be
valid.
one
would
be
if,
as
a
factual
matter,
the
defendant's
own
statements
showed
that
the
out-of-court
statement
was
reliable
to
a
degree
not
found
with
any
other
corroborating
evidence,
and
i
don't
think
that
that's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he
certainly
could
and
was
impeached
with
his
out-of-court
statements.
and
this
brings
me
to
the
second
reason,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
defendant
can
attack
the
reliability
of
his
own
out-of-court
confession.
he's
not
bound
by
some
notion
of
estoppel
that
because
he
said
it,
therefore
it
must
be
true.
and
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
that
michael
crawford
attempted
to
present
a
self-defense
at
trial
that
was
substantially
more
robust
than
the
statements
that
he
made
at
the
time.
and
under
crane
v.
kentucky,
this
court
has
held
that
a
defendant
can
attack
the
reliability
of
his
own
statements.
so
even
if
the
statements
did
directly
interlock,
in
the
sense
that
the
defendant's
statements
matched
the
out-of-court
declarant's
statements,
that
would
not
render
them
per
se
reliable
for
confrontation
purposes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and...
and
the
state
made
that
point
in
its
rebuttal
argument.
so
there...
there
is
certainly
ample
basis
for
saying
that
under
existing
law
the
statements
do
not
come
in.
the
question
for
the
court
is
should
the
court
revisit
its
ohio
v.
roberts
jurisprudence
because
of
the
concerns
about
whether
ohio
v.
roberts
was
constitutionally
accurate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
concerns
that
i
think
are...
are
raised
by
reading
the
confrontation
clause
as
an
original
matter
before
this
court's
jurisprudence
made
all
hearsay
subject
to
the
confrontation
clause.
now,
we
do
not
submit
that
there
is
a
practical
need
for
the
court
to
revise
its
jurisprudence.
the
united
states
has
not
encountered
a
significantly
difficult
burden
in
admitting
evidence
under
the
hearsay
rules
under
the
roberts
approach
as...
as
it
has
now
been
articulated.
and
we
also
acknowledge
that
the
court
would
have
to
develop
a
jurisprudence
to
decide
what
testimonial
statements
means,
if
the
court
adopts
the
testimonial
approach.
what
we
do
submit
is
that
the
way
in
which
the
word
witness
against
is
used
in
the
sixth
amendment,
particularly
when
read
in
light
of
the
way
the
word
witness
is
used
in
the
fifth
amendment
and
also
in
the
sixth
amendment's
compulsory
process
clause,
that
the
word
witness
was
meant
to
refer
to
people
who
were
giving
evidence
for
purposes
of
a
case,
not
to
people
who
simply
happen
to
observe
facts
in
the
world
and
made
statements
about
them
and
that
are
now
being
used
as
hearsay
in
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
they
both
involve
certain
challenges.
what
exists
today
is
a
body
of
law
that
has
examined
the
indicia
of
reliability
question,
and
with
respect
to
certain
statements
in
the
testimonial
category,
such
as
victim
statements
to
the
police
in
a
condition
that
might
be
likened
to
an
excited
utterance
or
sometimes
in
statements
in
aid
of
medical
diagnosis
or
treatment,
and
also
true
statements
against
penal
interests
such
as
guilty
pleas
by
a
defendant
that
does
not
implicate
the
defendant
on
trial
but
simply
acknowledges
criminal
conduct,
the
lower
courts
have
concluded
that
those
statements
do
have
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability
to
be
admitted.
and
our
concern
is
that
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
testimonial
approach,
that
it
not
do
so
in
a
way
that
would
foreclose
lower
courts
from
taking
advantage
of
evidence
that
is
reliable,
unavailable
from
another
source,
important
in
criminal
prosecutions
and
well-grounded
in
the
theory
of
the
confrontation
clause
as
a
vehicle
for
achieving
truth
in
criminal
trials.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
our
position
is
that
with
respect
to
testimonial
statements,
the
preference
is
to
get
live,
in-court
testimony
with
all
of
the
benefits
that
the
confrontation
clause
envisioned
for
testimony.
but
sometimes
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
is
still
awaiting
sentencing,
and
as
this
court
held
in
mitchell
v.
united
states,
the
defendant
still
has
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
can
refuse
to
testify
on
grounds
of
privilege.
other
defendants
who
plead
guilty
in
their
own
cases
will
sometimes
refuse
to
testify
even
on
pain
of
contempt,
and
at
that
point
the
choice
for
the
judicial
system
is
either
admitting
that's...
that
evidence
in
the
criminal
trial
or
excluding
it
altogether
and
risking
a
manifest
failure
of
justice
because
there
isn't
the
evidence.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
those
kinds
of
statements,
the
excited
utterances,
911
calls,
true
statements
against
penal
interests
that
implicate
only
one--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--thank
you--
