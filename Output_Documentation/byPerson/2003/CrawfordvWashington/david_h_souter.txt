justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
ultimate
criterion
is
was
it
made
with
the
understanding
that
it
would
or
probably
be
used
for
prosecutorial
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
was
going
to
say
there
was
no
conspiracy
found,
was
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
the
whole
point
of
admitting
it
that...
that
she
had,
in
effect,
said
there...
there
was
no
weapon,
the
victim
was
not
taking
a
weapon
out,
and
that
was
on
the
basis
of
her
statement
the
prosecutor
made
exactly
that
argument?
wasn't
that
why
it
came
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
her
description
did
not
include
one.
and...
and
wasn't
that
the
basis
of
the
prosecutor's
argument,
that
this
wasn't
self-defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
implication
of
his
description
was
that
he
reasonably
thought
something
was
coming
out
and
he
then
in
one
of
his
statements
said,
you
know,
it
was
him
or
me.
and
the
reason
her
statement
was
admitted
was
that
it
was
not
congruent
with
that,
that
there
was
no
indication
in
her
statement
that
a...
that
a...
a
weapon
was
being
withdrawn.
so
at
the...
i...
isn't...
isn't
that
the
reason
that
the
statement,
for
the
purpose
it
was
admitted,
was
not
interlocking?
