justice

scalia
why...
why
should
it
depend
on
the
intent
of
the
declarant?
i...
why
is
that...
why
does
that
make
the
declarant
a
witness
within
the
meaning
of
the
confrontation
clause?
i
mean,
suppose...
suppose
the
police
get...
get
the
statement
from
the
declarant
surreptitiously.
they
do
not
let...
let
him
know
that
they
are,
in
fact,
the
police.
that...
that
would
disqualify
it
under
the
law
professors'
test
from
being
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
he
would
not
know
that
this
was
going
to
be
used
in
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course...
of
course,
we
do.
i
mean,
i...
i
really
object
to
saying,
you
know,
just...
just
don't
worry
about
it.
we'll
worry
about
it
later.
i
mean,
if
there
are
real
problems
that
come
up
later,
i'm
not
going
to
buy
your...
your
retreat
from
roberts.
justice
antonin
scalia
cross-examination
by
the
defendant,
not
by
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
don't
understand.
you...
you
say
it's
limited
to
testimonial
statements.
the...
the
clause
is
limited
to
testimonial
statements.
however,
it
is
not
absolute.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
any
other
provisions
that
are
in
the
bill
of
rights
that
are
not
absolute
and
can
be
overcome
by
proof
that
the...
that
the
overall
purpose
of
the
truth-serving
function
is...
is
achieved?
for
example,
the
right
to
jury
trial.
do...
do
we
approach
that
by
saying,
oh,
in
a
really
complicated
case
where
a
jury
would
impeded
rather
than
facilitate
the
finding
of
truth
like,
you
know,
a
sherman
act
case,
yes,
it
says
there's...
you're...
you're
entitled
to
trial
by
jury,
but
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
to
achieve
truth,
and
where
that
purpose
wouldn't
be
served,
let's
forget
about
the
jury?
we
don't
say
that,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
do
we
say
it
about
the
confrontation
clause?
and
that...
that's
essentially
the
government's
argument,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
know
it
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
the
issue
here
is
whether
we...
we
should
retreat
from
those
statements.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that's
just
a
matter
of
limiting
the
scope.
the
right
to
counsel.
do
you
have
the
right
to
counsel
for,
you
know,
at...
at
every
moment
during...
during
recesses
in
the
trial
and
so
forth?
that's...
that's
just
a
matter
of
the
scope
of
it,
not
a
matter
of
saying,
yes,
this
is
within
the
scope.
this
is
testimonial,
but
we
nonetheless
will
not
follow
the
command
of...
of
the
constitutional
provision
that
the
accused
is
entitled
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
growing
and
being
developed
so
that
the...
the
guarantee
of
confrontation
is
just
a
guarantee
that
in
the
future
we'll...
we'll
leave
it
there
if
we
think
it
should
be
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
it
certainly
isn't.
you're...
you're
defining
the
underlying
purpose
much
more
broadly
than
the
law
professors.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
achieve
the
truth.
and
if
there
are
other
indicia--
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
developing
a
jurisprudence
to
decide
what
constitutes
testimonial
statements
is
any
more
difficult
than
developing
a
jurisprudence
to
determine
what
are
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability
to
overcome
the
text
of
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
unavailable
from
another
source?
let's
say
you
have
this...
this
self-incriminating
confession,
but
the
person
is
available.
you
could
put
him
on
the
stand
to
test
whether
that
confession
that
he
made
was
true
or
false.
why...
where
do
you...
where
do
you
pull
this
requirement
that...
that
he
be
unavailable
from?
if
indeed
it
doesn't
violate
the
confrontation
clause
because
it's
sufficiently
reliable,
why
does
he
have
to
be
unavailable?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
have
written
it
that
way,
i
suppose.
i
mean,
the
confrontation
clause
instead
of
saying
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him,
we
could
have
added,
comma,
unless
there
are
other
considerations.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
where
we
derive
this
permissibility
of
not
allowing
him
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him
so
long
as
we
come
to
the
judgment
that
the
evidence
is
inherently
reliable.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
could
be
amended.
it
could
be
amended.
i
mean,
you
know,
there's
an
amendment
provision
in
the
constitution,
but...
but
until
it's
amended,
it...
it
does
seem
to
say
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
you...
you
have
the
right
to
be
confronted.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
unreliable.
i
mean,
you
have
a
witness
who
says
two...
two
opposite
things.
i
saw
this,
and
on
the
other
hand,
i
shut
my
eyes.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but...
but
we
have
said
in
other
cases
that
the
reliability,
which...
which
roberts
insists
upon,
has
to
be
established
from
the
statement
itself
and
not
from
other
statements.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--interlocking
confessions.
that's
the
problem
i
have
with
it.
we...
we
haven't
had
such
a
case,
but
the
standard
that
we
expressed
in
roberts
would
seem
to
exclude
interlocking
confessions
as
establishing
reliability.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
what
we
said
in
lee
was
simply
that
assuming
that
an
interlocking
confession
exception
exists,
this
didn't
meet
it.
i...
i
don't
know
that
we...
that...
that
we
spoke
as
though
there
was
such
an
exception.
we
just
said
assuming
it
does
exist,
the
facts
here
don't...
don't
meet
it.
isn't
that
what
the
case
held?
