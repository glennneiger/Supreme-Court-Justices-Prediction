would
there
be
anything
that
fit
in
your
category
where
the
person
to
whom
the
statement
is
made
is
not
an
officer,
either
a
police
officer
or
prosecutor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you
say
that's
outside
of
the
confrontation
clause
entirely,
not
lumping
all
of
hearsay.
i
thought
your
whole
point
is
we
don't
want
to
lump
all
of
hearsay
under
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
one
aspect
of
this
case
that
before
your
time
is
up
i
hope
you
can
enlighten
me
on.
the
reason
that
this
witness
is
unavailable
is
that
the
defendant
has
exercised
his
right
to
prevent
his
wife
from
testifying
against
him.
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
but
because
he
could
have
not
asserted
that
or
not
waived
it,
why
doesn't
that
carry
over
also?
why
doesn't
her
immunity...
his
control
of
whether
she
can
speak...
why
doesn't
that
control
as
well
the
use
of
the
substitute
for
her
testimony?
if...
if
there
is
such
a
privilege,
why
doesn't
it
cover
both
her
actual
testimony
in
court
and
the
substitute
for
that
testimony?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
don't
understand
the
logic
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
state...
yes,
to
say
that
he
can
keep
her
off
the
stand,
but
he
can't
prevent
a
substitute
for...
for
that
statement--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
didn't
match,
and
that's
the
oddest
thing.
on
the
key
thing,
the
most
important
to
the
defendant,
he
suggested
that
the...
the
person
he
assaulted
had
reached
for
something
before
the
assault.
and
her
testimony...
or
her
statement
is
that
it
was
only
after
the
defendant
assaulted
the
victim
that
the
victim
reached
in...
in
his
pocket.
i
don't
see
how
those
could
be
said
to
interlock.
they
seem
to
clash
with
each
other
on
the
key
point
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
after
the
assault.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
don't
we
look
at
this
since
the
testimony
is
there?
i
read
it
that
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
of
the
worrisome
things
about
treating
all
these
things
is
just
hearsay
reliability.
i
don't
understand
how
this
testimony
comes
in.
when
the
woman
testified...
when
the
woman
said
in
her
statement
i
was
drunk,
i
closed
my
eyes,
how
could
that
possibly
be
reliable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
said
at
that
time
she
had
been
drinking
and
she...
that
happened
before.
i
just
don't
understand
this
reliability
test
that
allows
something
to
come
in
that
doesn't
coincide
with
what
the
defendant
himself
said,
and
that
the
declarant
is
saying,
oh,
i
was
scared.
i
closed
my
eyes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
did
say
that
she
shut
her
eyes
and
didn't
really
watch.
those
were
her
words.
i
shut
my
eyes
and
didn't
really
watch.
how
could
such
testimony
be
reliable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
bottom
line
was
that
it...
that
that
test
was
not
met
in
the
case,
that
there
wasn't
a
sufficient
interlock.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
the
court
retain
it
when
this
very
case
gives
us
an
example
of
how
arbitrary
that
determination
is
made
whether
it's
reliable?
when
a
court
can
call
something...
a
witness...
a
declarant
in
the
shape
this
one
was
and
say
that's
reliable,
shouldn't
that
make
us
worry
about
using
that
test?
