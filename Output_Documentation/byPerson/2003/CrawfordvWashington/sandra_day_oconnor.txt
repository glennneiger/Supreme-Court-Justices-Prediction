when
you--
--but
you...
you...
your
proposal
would
effect
a
significant
change
in
doctrine,
i
guess,
from
the
roberts
case,
and
i
think
even
under
your
proposal
certain
testimonial
statements
would
be
admissible
against
the
defendant,
for
instance,
where
the
defendant
has
contributed
to
making
the
witness
unavailable
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
you...
you
would
still
have
some
testimonial
statements
in
there.
tell
me
which
of
our
cases,
since
the
roberts
decision,
would
have
come
out
differently
under
your
proposed
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
isn't...
isn't
that
our...
our
function
in
part?
we
occasionally
take
cases
from
lower
courts
to
straighten
out
misconceptions.
presumably
that's
how
these
things
get
worked
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
even
the
speaker
or
the
person
taking
the
statement.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
i
don't
understand
your
response.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
know,
the
concern
we
ought
to
have
with
your
approach
is
we're
going
to
get
into
some
very
tricky
questions
if
we
go
your
route
in
deciding
what's
testimonial,
and
why
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
your
view
that
a
co-conspirator
statement
is
not
testimonial
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
how...
how
about
a
wire
tap?
you've
got
a
wire
tap
going,
and
you
hear
co-conspirators
on...
on
the
other
end
of
the
wire.
is
that
testimonial
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
your
approach
it
would
come
in
without
difficulty.
it
would
not
be
testimonial.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
look
at
this
very
case
and
tell
me
whether
the
result
is
any
different
at
the
end
of
the
day
under
roberts
versus
your
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
therefore?
i
mean,
relate
it
to
this
case,
if
you
would.
tell
me
whether
the
result
would
differ
under
your
proposal
and
under
roberts
in
this
very
case.
why
don't
you
focus
on
the
statement
and
tell
us
why
it
would
or
would
not
be
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
kind
of
want
it
both
ways.
it's
kind
of
an
odd
position.
has
the
government
taken
a
different
position
on
the
testimonial
aspect
in
the
past?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
in
this
case?
there's
a
co-conspirator's
statement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
not
as
a
so-called
interlocking...
well,
it
was
an
interlocking--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--type
of
confession
or
something.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
roberts--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
well
as--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think
this
was
interlocking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
certainly
differed
on
a
key
element.
i'm
not
sure
it
would
come
in
under
roberts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
lee
involved
co-defendants.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
actually
that
there
were
five
members
of
the
court
in
lee
v.
illinois
to
say
that
confessions
of
a
co-defendant
are
presumptively
unreliable
for
purposes
of
roberts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
even
if
there
was
a
so-called
interlocking
confession
exception,
it
wasn't
met
in
that
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
they
better
re-read
it.
