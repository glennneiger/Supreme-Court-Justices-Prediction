michael

crawford
v.
washington.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
out-of-court
testimony,
mr.
fisher,
what
do
you
mean
by
the
word
testimony?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
may...
it...
the...
it
applies
to
the...
if
it's
made
to
the
authorities
but
not
to
a
third
person?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if...
if
we're
going
to
change,
as
you
suggest
in
your
brief,
to
using
this
term
testimonial,
it
certainly
does
not
bring
any
great
certainty,
does
it,
if
you
say
something
tips
the
balance
one
way
or
another?
obviously,
you're
going
to
get
a
lot
of
close
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
change?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we've...
but
we've
had
roberts
for
23
years,
and
we
certainly
haven't
filled
our
docket
with
confrontation
clause
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
if
it
meets
the
test
of
a
statement
made
to
the
police?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
is
it
excludable
under
your
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about
a
statement
like
in
mancusi
or
one
of
those
cases
where
the
witness
is
given
prior
recorded
testimony?
there's
been
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
the
witness
is
presently
dead
or
unavailable.
does
that
come
in
under
your
system?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would...
would
your
approach
overrule
inadi?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
wouldn't
have
to
say...
show
that
a
particular
declarant
was
unavailable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
then
how
about
a
spontaneous
declaration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
would
come
in
under
your
system?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without...
without
having
to
show
unavailability.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
would
overrule
inadi
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
he
be
impeached
with
his
out-of-court
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
concerns
by
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sherman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the...
the
only
kind
of
evidence
that
can
become...
come
in
at
a
criminal
trial
is
from
a
witness
who's
physically
present
in
the
courtroom.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sherman.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
02-9410,
crawford
against
washington.
the
petitioner,
michael
crawford,
was
convicted
by
the
state
of
washington
of
assault.
crawford’s
wife,
sylvia,
was
present
during
the
alleged
assault.
at
trial,
crawford
claims
self-defense.
the
prosecutor
responded
by
playing
a
tape
recorded
description
of
the
fight
that
sylvia
had
given
during
a
police
interrogation.
the
prosecutor
called
this
damning
evidence
that
completely
refutes
crawford’s
self-defense
claim.
because
of
the
state
marital
privilege,
sylvia
did
not
testify
at
trial.
crawford
argued
that
admitting
the
tape
recorded
statement
against
him
violated
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him
because
he
had
no
opportunity
to
cross-examine
sylvia
about
her
statement.
the
washington
supreme
court
affirmed
crawford’s
conviction.
it
held
that
even
though
crawford
had
no
opportunity
for
cross-examination,
the
statement
could
be
admitted
if
it
was
reliable.
it
sided
our
decision
in
ohio
against
roberts
which
held
that
hearsay
evidence
can
be
admitted
even
without
an
opportunity
for
cross-examination
if
it
bears
what
we
called
indicia
of
reliability
either
because
it
falls
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception
or
as
a
particularized
guarantees
of
trustworthiness.
the
court
found
that
sylvia’s
statement
had
guaranteed
of
trustworthiness
because
it
overlapped
or
interlocked
with
the
statement
crawford
himself
had
given
the
police.
so,
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
state
violated
crawford’s
sixth
amendment
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
scalia
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
court
concludes
that
it
did.
the
sixth
amendment
was
adapted
to
protect
against
particular
abuses
that
had
occurred
in
england.
justices
of
the
peace
or
other
government
officers
examined
witnesses
before
trial
and
then
read
those
examinations
to
the
jury
without
giving
the
defendant
an
opportunity
for
cross-examination.
the
most
notable
example
was
the
trial
of
sir
walter
raleigh
in
1603
where
the
crown’s
evidence
consisted
almost
entirely
of
accomplice’s
out-of-court
confession
implicating
raleigh.
english
law
developed
a
right
of
confrontation
to
guard
against
these
abuses
and
the
sixth
amendment
made
that
right
part
of
our
constitution.
this
history
suggests
that
the
sixth
amendment
was
directed
primarily
at
particular
kinds
of
out-of-court
statements
such
as
examinations
by
government
officers
out
of
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
sylvia’s
interrogation
by
the
police
falls
squarely
within
this
core
class
of
testimonial
statements.
the
court
holds
that
such
statements
cannot
be
admitted
against
the
defendant
unless
the
witness
is
unavailable
to
testify
at
trial
and
the
defendant
has
had
a
prior
opportunity
for
cross-examination.
that
rule
must
be
followed
whether
or
not
the
judge
himself
believes
that
the
evidence
is
reliable.
where
testimonial
statements
are
at
issue,
the
only
index
of
reliability
sufficient
to
satisfy
constitutional
demands
is
the
one
the
constitution
actually
prescribes
confrontation.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
washington
supreme
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
unanimous
but
i,
in
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
joined
by
justice
o’connor,
would
adhere
to
ohio
against
roberts
and
decide
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
state
court
should
not
have
relied
on
the
interlocking
nature
of
the
two
confessions.
