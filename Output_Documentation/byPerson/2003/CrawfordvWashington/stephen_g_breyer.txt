justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
give
the
reasons,
i...
i
want
to
go
back
to
what
you
said.
you
say
the
test
should
be
functional
equivalent
of
testimony.
the
functional
equivalent
is
a
little
vague,
and
the
law
professors
in
their
amicus
brief
suggest
that
the
question
should
be,
would
a
reasonable
person
in
the
position
of
declarant
anticipate
that
the
statement
would
likely
be
used
for
evidentiary
purposes?
would
you
accept
that
as
a...
a...
would
you
adopt
that
phrasing
of
the
question,
or
do
you
have
a
different
phrasing,
or
do
you
think
if
we
did
follow
your
approach,
the
opinion
should
simply
say
functional
equivalent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
i
mean
it's
true
that...
i
realize
that,
but...
but
perhaps
we
could
do
a
little
bit
better
than
say
just
testimonial.
if...
if
we
accepted
your
approach--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
i'm...
i'm...
i
want
your
opinion
on
that.
i
mean,
there...
we
have
several
briefs
here.
we
have
variations
on
the
theme,
and
i
want
to
know
which
variation
you
think
is
the
best
or
which
is
the
worst.
i
read
you
one
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
think
the
professors
there
are
thinking
that
isn't
difficult.
i
think
they're
thinking
it
is
the
question
of
whether
a
reasonable
person
in
the
declarant's
position
would
think
it
was
likely
that
this
was
going
to
be
used
in
testimony
because
if
you
look
to
the
position
of
the
police,
you
will
suddenly
find
that
tape
recorded
informant
testimony
of
an
ongoing
conspiracy,
while
they're
planning
to
rob
the
bank,
and
suddenly
is
kept
out
of
court.
and
there
is
no
reason.
we
wouldn't
keep
it
out
of
court
today.
it
would
be...
come
in
under
the
co-conspirator
rule.
so
i
think
that
they
wrote
these
words
in
this
brief
thinking
about
it,
and
now
if
we're
suddenly
going
to
go
and...
and
open
this
all
up
to
a
whole
bunch
of
other
things,
i'd
be
a
little
nervous
about
it
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not...
you're
right.
it's
not
automatically.
under
the
rule
today,
if
it's
a
co-conspirator
statement,
right
in
the
police
station,
because
it's
an
ongoing
coverup
conspiracy,
i
guess
it
would
come
in.
but
i
think
under
the
new
rule,
if
in
fact
everybody
in
that
room
knows
that
it
is
likely
to
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
testimonial
use
at
trial,
it
would
not
come
in.
i
think
that's
the
point
of
the
change.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
maybe
your
position
is
not
different
from...
from
theirs
in
this
respect,
if
you
take
the
law
professors'.
if
you
say,
as
you
do
in
your
brief,
that
it
allows
testimonial
evidence
in
where
the
circumstances
are
such
that
they
serve
the
same
underlying
purpose
as
the
confrontation
clause,
then
all
you're
saying
is
the
same
thing
that
they
say
here.
will
the
accused
have
had
an
adequate
opportunity
to
confront
the
witness?
in
other
words,
like
a...
a
prior
trial.
is
that
all
you're
saying?
because
if
that's
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
achieve
the
truth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sir
walter
raleigh...
if
they
came
in...
sir
walter
raleigh...
in
fact,
it
is
shown
that
all
the...
the
statements
made
out
of
court
against
sir
walter
raleigh
were
made
in
front
of
12
bishops,
and
at
that
time
that
was
a
very,
very
good
security
that
this
was
completely
true.
twelve
bishops
who
saw
the
thing
and...
and
they,
you
know,
go...
they
say,
absolutely
accurate.
in...
in
your
opinion,
that
would
then
come
in
in
sir
walter
raleigh's
own
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
sir
walter
raleigh...
it
came
out
that
they
did
introduce
this
thing.
so
you're
saying
if
we
take...
if
we
take--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
witnesses,
confront
witnesses.
a
witness
is
a
person
who
testifies
and
i
don't
see
any
literal
problem
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
typical
case
that...
where
it
should
come
in,
but
i
guess
under
their
proposal
it
would,
and
under
the
status
quo
it
probably
wouldn't.
we
have
a
case
of
drug
conspiracy.
during
the
conspiracy,
well
before
anybody
is
caught,
they
discover,
through
whatever
means,
that
there's
a
cup
on
the
mantel,
a
pewter
cup,
that's
filled
with
drugs.
who
does
it
belong
to?
does
it
belong
to
the
defendant?
we
have
a
witness
who
overheard
the
defendant's
wife
shout
out
from
the
kitchen,
dink,
have
you
got
your
pewter
cup?
it's
on
the
mantel.
all
right?
does
that
come
in
or
not
come
in?
whether
it
does
or
not,
it's
not
a
confrontation
clause
question.
you
say
that
we
should
make
that
into
a
constitutional
question.
we
should
have
all
the
constitutional
courts
going
into
it
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
say
it
is.
in
other
words,
every
time
that
a...
that
a...
a
trial
in
any
one
of
50
million
trials
in
the
united
states
decides
to
admit
some
hearsay,
in
principle,
you
go
into
habeas
and
the
federal
judge
has
to
decide
whether
that
hearsay
is
or
is
not,
quote,
reliable,
end
quote,
for
purposes
of
the
confrontation
clause.
that's
the
present
system.
so
you're
the
prosecuting
attorney.
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
experience
in
this
area.
tell
me
if
this
is
right.
what
i
would
expect
to
have
happen
is
that
all
these
habeas
courts,
when
they
get
real
hearsay,
nothing
to
do
with
the
trial,
you
know,
real
hearsay
like
i
just
talked
to
you
about,
they'll
find
it
reliable
if
the...
if
the...
if
the
state
court
admitted
it.
then,
however,
they
get
to
this
kind
of
a
case
where
the
police
were
actually
there
writing
out
affidavits
which
they're
going
to
introduce,
and
there
what
they'll
say
is,
no,
it's
not
reliable.
so
in
order
to
make
the
roberts
system
work,
what
will
happen
is
you
have
to
have
two
ideas
of
reliability.
now,
has
that
been
a
problem
or
am
i
just
making
that
up?
because
what
they're
saying
is
the
roberts
thing
makes
no
sense.
if
you
take
it
seriously,
it
keeps
out
stuff
that
should
come
in
and
it
lets
in
stuff
that
should
stay
out.
and
if
you
don't
take
it
seriously,
which
is
what
must
have
happened,
it
just
produces
a
mess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
from
your
own
experience.
i'm
quite
interested
actually,
if...
if
you
followed
what
i
was
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
work
in
this
area
and
i'd
like
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
suppose
we
said
it
was
unreliable.
let's
suppose
we
held
that.
and
in
this
case
it
goes
out.
all
right.
now,
so
we've
had
a
pretty
tough
standard
in
your
view
of
what
counts
as
reliable
and
not.
it's
been
a
pretty
tough
standard.
it
has
to
be
really
reliable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
what's
going
to
happen
when
the
courts,
the
federal
courts
or
the
state
courts,
apply
that
tough
standard
of
reliability
to
hearsay
statements
that
have
to
do
with
the...
involved
in
the
commissions
of
the
crime
itself?
in
other
words,
not...
not
when
they're
in
the
police
station
giving
confessions,
but
like
the
example
i
gave
you
with
the
cup.
now,
suppose
we
apply
the
tough
standard
of
reliability
to
those.
would
that
make
a
difference?
would
they
then
start
to
be
kept
out
because
they
violate
the
confrontation
clause?
