mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
confrontation
clause
prohibited
the
admission
of
the
accomplice's
custodial
statement
here
for
two
reasons:
first,
because
its
interlocking
nature
did
not
establish
its
reliability
under
this
court's
roberts
jurisprudence;
and
second,
and
more
fundamentally,
because
the
accomplice's
custodial
statement
amounted
to
out-of-court
testimony
that
was
never
submitted
to
cross-examination,
in
violation
of
the
traditional
understanding
of
the
right
to
confrontation.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
what
i
mean,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
someone
giving
a
statement
out
of
court
that
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
what
they
would
do
in
court,
which
is
to
say
they're
giving
the
authorities
a
statement
that
is
describing
an
event
in
a
way
that
they
understand
is
going
to
be
used
in
a
criminal
investigation.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
ordinarily
that's
the...
that
would
be
the
dividing
line.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
because
the
confrontation
clause,
to
go
back
to
the
text
and
to
start
with
the
text,
talks
about
being
a
witness
against
somebody.
and
the...
and
the
common
understanding
of
that
term
is
to
give
a
statement
that
you
understand
is
going
to
be
used
in
a
criminal
investigation,
and
when
you're
giving
a
statement
to
the
authorities,
here
a
custodial
statement
to
the
police,
that's
a
different
situation
than
the
ordinary,
everyday
occurrence
of
speaking
to
a
friend
or
a
colleague
or
something.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
the
way
i
read
the...
the
term
witness
against
in
the
constitution.
it's
the
gateway
to
the
confrontation
clause.
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
private--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
mean,
i...
i
think
that
that's
the
kind
of
a
statement
that
ordinarily
is
not
going
to
be
testimonial.
you
know,
an
auto
accident...
i
take
it
you're...
you're
talking
about
an
auto
accident
in
terms
of
a
criminal
case.
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
mean,
that's
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
there
could
be
a
difficult
question
in
something
like
that,
but
i
think
that
is
likely
not
to
be
testimonial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
the
police
officer
certainly
tips
the
balance
and
certainly
when
somebody
is
talking
to
a
police
officer,
that's
the
kind
of
a
statement
they
understand
is
going
to
be
used
in
court.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
going
to
be
some
close
cases
out
on
the
margins,
and
i
acknowledge
that.
but
what
the
testimonial
approach
does
is
it
covers
the
core
cases,
the
ones
that
the
confrontation
clause
has
always
been
concerned
with.
and
really,
it's
not
so
much
a
new
test.
what...
what
the
testimonial
approach
does
is
really
sum
up
what
this
court
itself
did
in
interpreting
the
common
law
and
bringing
that
under
the
umbrella
of
the
sixth
amendment
starting
in
kirby
and
mattox,
the
court's
earliest
decisions
on
the
confrontation
clause,
really
all
the
way
up
through
douglas
in
the
1960's
where
actually
in
that
very
opinion
the
court
uses
the
term
to
describe
a
custodial
confession...
the
court
uses
the
term
the
equivalent
of
testimony.
and
so
that's
the
kind
of
a
situation
we're
talking
about
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
think,
your
honor,
any
cases
since
roberts.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
nor
any
case
before
roberts.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
because
the
lower
courts
aren't
getting
it
right,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
think
that
the
problem
is,
is
that
the
roberts
approach
sets
up
a
framework
that
is
both
unworkable
in
practice
and
is
leading
to
consistently
anomalous
results.
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
how
i
understand
the
facts
of
the
case,
justice
kennedy.
the
victim
was...
was
in
police
custody
at
the
time
of
the
examination,
and
it
was
in
coordination
with
the
police.
so,
yes,
idaho
v.
wright,
as
well
as
this
court's
other
cases,
would
come
out.
but
it's
important,
you
know,
to
go
back
to
the
question
and
say,
you
know,
why
change
for
roberts
if
we've
gotten
to
the
right
places
in...
in
our
cases.
and
the
answer
is,
you
know,
certainly
this
court
may
never
have
to
change
from
roberts,
but
simply
understanding
the
way
that
roberts
is
working
in
the
lower
courts
i
believe
should
cause
this...
cause
the
court
great
concern.
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
but,
you
know,
i
would
submit
that
you're
going
to
have
to
practically
fill
your
docket
with
confrontation
clause
cases
doing
error
correction
in
order
to
come
out
correct
in
all
these
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
that's
right.
and
that's...
and...
and
what's
happened,
because
you
haven't
done
that,
is
the
lower
courts
are
reaching
some
very,
very
bad
results.
i
was
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
why
change
from
roberts
if
we're
getting
to
the
right
solution,
and
reason
is
because
the
way
that
the
test
is
framed,
it
just
simply
is
unworkable
in
the
lower
courts.
as
we
cited
in
our
brief,
there
are...
we
gathered
20
factors
that
lower
courts
are
using
for
indicia
of
reliability.
we
could
have
listed
40
or
50.
the
united
states
is
asking
you,
as
well
as
the
state,
to
stick
with
this...
stick
with
this
reliability
approach
for
all
of
its
faults.
and
you
know,
the...
the
ironic
thing
with
that
kind
of
a...
of...
of
a
position
is
the
more
testimonial
the
statement
is,
the
more
reliable
it
is,
and
in
turn--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
breyer,
you
don't
have
to
get
too
far
into
that
in
this
case
because,
of
course--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
i
agree
with
the
starting
point
of
the
functional
equivalent
of
testimony.
and
then
i
think
that
the
law
professors'
test,
the
reasonable
expectation,
is
a
good
test,
and
i
would...
i
would
embellish
that
by
saying
that
i
think
that
what
we
have
is
99
cases
out
of
100
that's
going
to
be
the
situation
that
i...
i
believe
the
chief
justice
brought
up,
which
is
the...
somebody
speaking
to
the
authorities
in
the
course
of
the
investigation
of
a
crime,
somebody
giving
a
statement
to
the
authorities
or
directing
one
to
them.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
there
may
be,
and
the
reason...
i
think
there
may
be
a...
a
rare,
rare
case,
justice
ginsburg,
in
a
scenario...
you
know,
come
up
with
hypotheticals.
one
possible
scenario
might
be
somebody
giving
a
statement
to
their
friend
and
directing
them
to
tell
the
police.
so,
you
know,
simply
using
an
intermediary
where
we
know
the
statement
is
going
to
the
police,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
in
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
mean,
i
think
that's
a
situation...
you
know,
and
this
is
where
the
definitional
problem
gets
difficult.
i
mean,
because
the
other
part
of
the
confrontation
clause
is
a
limitation
on
state
power,
and
it
says...
you
know,
going
all
the
way
blackstone,
it's
a
limitation
on
the
state
molding
statements
that
it's
going
to
use
later
in
a
criminal
investigation.
so
if
that
kind
of
a
situation
were
present
where
somebody
is
molding
somebody's
statement,
i
think
that
might
be
something
the
confrontation
clause
is
concerned
with
as
well.
and
that
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
to
say
that,
yes,
there
may
be,
you
know,
difficult
cases...
difficult
hypothetical
out
in
the
margin,
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
test
that
covers
what
are
the
time-and-again
cases
that
are
coming
before
this
court
and
coming
before
the
lower
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
certainly
i...
i...
you
know,
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
question
in
this
case,
but
i
think
that
if
either
one
of
them--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
see,
your
honor.
i
think
that
proper...
the
proper
test
would
be
if...
if
one
of
the
two
people
is
so...
you
know,
is
doing
something
with
the
purpose
of
understanding
it's
going
to
be
used
in
a
criminal
case,
then
we
have
a
testimonial
situation.
i
think
you...
this
court
could
say
that,
but
it...
you
have
to
look
back--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
certainly
the
speaker
and
i
think
there
may
be
situations...
and
this
is...
this
is
something
the
court
can
deal
with
about
when
this...
about
when
the...
when
the
governmental
officer
is
the
only
one
and...
and
is
under
such
a
circumstance
that
the
governmental
officer
is
molding
the
statement
in
such
a
way
and
molding
what
somebody
is
going
to
say--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
the
first
reason
is
because,
as
i
said,
if
you
have
difficult
cases
out
on
the
margin,
i
submit
to
the
court
the
constitution
could
tolerate
that.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
i'm
sorry,
mr....
justice
breyer.
i
may
have
misunderstood
partially
the
suggestion...
the
hypothetical
that
i
was
getting.
i
think
you're
correct
that
the
traditional
kind
of
co-conspirator
statements
under
that
kind
of
a
situation
would
come
in
under
either
approach.
what
i
understood
the
hypothetical
to
be
was
a
situation
where
somebody,
after
a
conspiracy
is
done,
is
doing--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
the
ordinary
course
of
events.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
if
there's
an
undercover
officer
present,
it
meets...
it
meets
the...
the...
you
know,
the
test
of
a
statement
made
to
the
police.
but
then
i
think
this
is
where
the
law
professors
have
it
right,
and
this
is
where
i'm
agreeing
with
justice
breyer.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
the
traditional
kind
of
co-conspirator
statement
that
is
not
covered
by
the
testimonial
approach.
and...
and
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--without
difficulty
as
to
the
confrontation
clause,
yes,
justice
o'connor.
and
i
think
it's
important
when
we
look
at
these
hypotheticals
to
compare
what
we
have
on
the
other
side
when
you
look
at
the
roberts
approach.
under
the
roberts
approach,
no
matter
how
much...
you
know,
if
somebody
gives
an
out-of-court
affidavit,
if
somebody
speaks
ex
parte
to
a
grand
jury,
even
if
a
witness
takes
the
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
criminal
trial...
in...
in
a
criminal
trial
and
puts
blame
directly
on
the
defendant,
and
then,
for
example,
were
to
die
or
suddenly
go
missing,
under
roberts
you
have
the
situation
where
the
trial
judge
doesn't
strike
the
testimony,
doesn't
disallow
it,
but
looks
to
its
reliability.
and
the
odd
thing...
and
this
is
what
i
was
getting
to
earlier.
compared
to
what
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
are
proposing
to
you
today,
the
odd
thing
is
the
more
testimonial
it
is,
the
more
it
comes
under
the
core
concern
of
the
confrontation
clause
that
started
in
raleigh's
trial
and
has
moved
all
the
way
forward...
the
more
testimonial
it
is,
the
more
likely
it's
pass...
it
is
to
pass
the
roberts
test.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
the
answer
is
absolutely
not,
justice
o'connor.
under
this
court's
wright
opinion...
you
know,
the
rationale
for
the
lower
court
was
interlocking
confessions.
under
this
court's
roberts...
i'm
sorry.
under
this
court's
opinion
in
wright,
it
is
only
the
inherent
indicia
of
reliability
surrounding
a
statement
not
other
evidence
at
trial
that
a
judge
can
look
to.
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
doesn't
matter
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
because
under
wright,
you
cannot
look
to
the
defendant's
confession
in
order
to
assess
the
reliability
of
sylvia's
statement,
and
that's
what
the
washington
supreme
court
did.
the
second
reason
is
even
if
you
could
look
to
that...
to
the
substantive
evidence
at
trial,
several
other
indicia
showed
that
the
statement
here
was
unreliable.
the...
the
witness
was
drunk.
she
said
she'd
been
in
shock
during
the
events.
she
gave
two
inconsistent
statements
within
a
4-hour
span.
she
was
in
police
custody
after
being
told
that
it
depended
what
she
told
the
officers
as
to
whether
or
not
she'd
be
allow
to
leave.
so
there
are
several,
several
reasons
to
believe
that
the
statement
here--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--you
know,
is
excludable
under
both
tests.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
under
the
testimonial
approach,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
for
the
simple
reason
that
she
was
in
custody
giving
a
statement,
giving
a
confession
or
a...
or
a
custodial
examination
to
police
officers
knowing
it
was
going
to
be
used
in
the
criminal
investigation.
that's
the
traditional...
it
is...
is
the
most
common...
it
is
the
core
concern
of
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
brings
us
all
the
way
back
to
raleigh's
trial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mancusi
comes
out
exactly
the
same
way,
and
here's
why.
and
this
shows
why
my
test...
why
the
testimonial
approach
is
actually
quite
narrow.
all
the
testimonial
approach
says
is
the
witness
has
to
have
had
a
chance
to
cross-examine
the
witness.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if,
when
it
comes
time
for
trial...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'm
sorry.
the
defendant
has
to
have
had
a
chance
to
cross-examine
the
witness.
if
trial
rolls
around
and
the
witness
is
unavailable,
through
no
fault
of
the
parties,
and
there's
been
adequate
cross-examination,
as
in
mancusi
and
actually
as
in
roberts
itself...
and...
and
i
actually--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
the
statement
needs
to
be
given
in
the
defendant's
presence
with
the
defendant
himself
having
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
you
would
have
to
show
that
a
particular
declarant
is
unavailable--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
it
were
a
testimonial
statement.
what...
what--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
that's
the
kind
of
a
thing
that's
traditional
hearsay.
it's
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
phrase
witness
against.
it's
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
testimonial
approach.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
an
excited
utterance
comes
out
the
same
way
under--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
it's
just
purely
a
hearsay
question,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
exactly
right.
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it's...
it's
close,
justice
ginsburg.
washington
law
renders
as
a
default
rule
that
a
spouse
is
unavailable
to
testify
against
another
spouse.
mr.
crawford
here
declined
to
waive
that
privilege.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
mean,
i
think
you're
asking
me
as
a
federal
issue.
as...
you
know,
as
a
state
law
issue,
washington
state
law
has
decided
that
the
second...
that
the
out-of-court
statement
can
come
in.
as
a
federal--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--as
a...
well,
the
reason...
you
don't
understand
the
logic
of
the
state
law
rule?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
agree,
justice
ginsburg.
it
is...
it
is
a
somewhat
odd
state
law
rule.
there's
a...
there's
a
case
called
state
v.
burden
that
the
washington
supreme
court
held
that
the
marital
privilege
applies
just
to
the...
just
to
actually
facing
your
spouse
on
the
stand
in
the
course
of
a
trial
because
it...
you
know,
it
helps
your
spouse
avoid
the
possibility
of
perjury
and
things
like
that.
and
it
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
out-of-court
statements.
i
think
you
could
make
a
very
strong
argument
that
it
ought
to
apply
to
both,
but
as
a
state
law
matter,
the
washington
supreme
court
has
said
only
in-court
testimony.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
important
to
concentrate
in
rebuttal
on
the
state's
suggestion
and
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
to
retain
the
reliability
prong
of
the
roberts
framework.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
us
that
the
history
of
the...
that...
that
you
ought
to
be
looking
to
history
here,
and
the
history
on
this
point
is
crystal
clear.
from
rex
v....
rex
v.
paine
in
1696,
other
english
cases
before
the
constitution,
and
then
this
court's
cases
after
the
constitution
was
adopted,
principally
kirby
and
mattox,
and
all
the
way
through
douglas,
the...
when
the
situation
arose
that
a
witness
was
unavailable,
the
rule
was
clear
if
the...
if...
if
the
statement
was
testimonial,
given
to
the
authorities,
it
had
to
be
excluded.
and
it's
not...
and
the...
and
the
balance
was
struck
by
the
framers
not...
not
just
because
of
these
public
policy
considerations,
but
because
of
the
framers
were
insisting
upon
an
adversarial
method
of
giving
testimony.
and
when
the
framers
decided,
when
that
was
not
present,
that
we
were
simply
not
prepared
to...
to
admit
the
testimony.
and
so
what
we
have
is
we
have
a
clear
rule
until
at
least
the
1970's
that
reliability
doesn't
matter.
and
the
only
time
reliability...
first
was
adopted
by
this
court.
the
only
time
it
became
important
was
in
dutton
v.
evans
when
you
had
a
non-testimonial
statement,
and
then
in
roberts
when
this
court
created
a
general
framework
that
it
allowed
reliability,
all
of
a
sudden,
be
into
play
when
we
were
stretching
the
confrontation
clause
in
our
view
too
far.
but
once
you
bring
the
confrontation
clause
back
to
the
proper
scope,
as
we're
asking
you
to
do
and
the
solicitor
general
is
asking
you
to
do,
there's
really
no
reason
anymore
to...
to
keep
the
reliability
prong.
the
reliability
prong
was...
was
adopted
by
this
court
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
hearsay
that
was
coming
outside
the
testimonial
type
setting.
once
you...
once
you
read
it...
read
that
problem
away,
we're
back
to
the
original
understanding
of
the
confrontation
clause.
and
the
reason
that
you
ought
to
stick
with
that...
justice
ginsburg
i
think
put
the
nail
on
the
head
when
she
said
the
reason
we're
here
today
is
that
you
have
a...
you...
you
have...
what
you
have
now
is
a
system
where
trial
judges
can
reach
almost
any
conclusion
they
want.
that's
shown
in
our
briefs.
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
even
describe
to
you
how
reliability...
doesn't
even
defend
reliability
findings
in
light
of
all
the
briefing
by...
by
the
petitioner
and
by
amici.
and
so
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
that,
you
show
that
the
very
concern
that
gave
rise
to
raleigh
trial...
and
i
would
say
parenthetically
that
i
believe
lord
cobham
was
unavailable
in
the
trial.
that's
what
the
transcript
says.
and
the
very
problem
was
that
trial
judges
could
do
these
reliability
determinations
in
place
of...
of
a
clear
rule
of
when
testimony
could
be
given.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
