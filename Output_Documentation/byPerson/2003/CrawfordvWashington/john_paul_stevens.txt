justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
you...
just...
just
with
the
dialogue
with
justice
scalia,
because
i'm
interested
in
the
same
problem,
is
it
the
intent
of
the
speaker
or
the
intent
of
the
person
taking
the
statement
that
would
be...
be
more
relevant
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
government
doesn't
endorse
that
position,
as
i
understand
it.
