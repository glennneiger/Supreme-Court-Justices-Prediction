mr.
steven
c.
sherman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
washington
is
asking
the
court
to...
i
guess,
to
simply
say...
excuse
me...
retain
the
reliability
framework
of
ohio
v.
roberts.
excuse
me.
the...
the
primary
part
of
ohio
v.
roberts
that's
important
to
the
state
is
the
reliability
factor,
and
the
reason
that...
that
that's
important
is
because
essentially
ohio
v.
roberts
recognizes
that
there
are
other
rights
and
interests
at
stake
in
a
criminal
trial
other
than
the
defendant's
confrontation
rights.
for
example,
it
recognizes
that
society
as
a
whole
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
criminal
activity
is
properly
addressed.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
that's
correct--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
when
i--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--well,
your
honor,
i
guess
to
answer
that
question
properly,
i...
i'll
speak
to
what
i
at
least
read
and
heard
actually
petitioner
and
in
one
of
the
amici
briefs
concerning
the...
the
history
surrounding
the
confrontation
clause
and
how
we
got
to
have
the
right
to
confrontation.
and
essentially
what
i...
i
gleaned
from
that
is
there,
at
a
point
in
time,
was
not
a
right
to
confrontation,
and
over
the
course
of
centuries,
the
right
developed.
but
it
appears
to
me
that
it
developed
based...
developed
based
upon
really
what
public
policy
was,
that
the...
the
society
would
not
tolerate
the
inequities
of
the
systems
that
were
in
place
that
were
denying
confrontation
and
felt
that
it
was
fair
that
this
concept
of
confrontation
take
place.
so
when
the...
the
framers
of
the
constitution
put
that
right
into
the
bill
of
rights,
it
was
based
upon,
in
my
view,
their
perception
that
the
public
policy
that
their
society
at
that
time
wanted
to
recognize
and
make
everyone
know
that
they're
retaining
that
to
be
their
right.
i
don't
think,
though,
that
it
would
rationally
follow
that...
that
they
intended
that
everything
that
they
said
be
written
in
stone
and--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--and
i
would
agree.
and
in
fact,
i...
i
think
one
of
the
points
that...
that
i...
i
want
to
make
is
that
a
literal
interpretation
of
the
confrontation
clause
bars
the
petitioner's
proposal
and
the
proposal
of
amici
and
the
proposal
of
the
state
to
maintain
the
roberts
framework.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
if
you
take
literally
the
confrontation
clause,
i
believe
that
it--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--i...
i
believe
that
everyone
that
comes
and
sits
on
the
witness
stand
and
says
anything
that
is
going
to
be
used--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--well,
i...
i
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--that
it's
not
a
confrontation
clause
question.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
correct.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
to
address
the
first
part
of
your
question,
your
honor,
i
believe
what
i
was...
was
attempting
to
say
was
that
the
confrontation
clause,
strictly
interpreted,
it
is
going
to
not
let
any
hearsay
of
any
kind
in.
yes,
that
is
my
position.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
i
believe
that
that
would
be
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
confrontation
clause,
your
honor.
to
answer
the
second
part
of...
of
your
question--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--well,
actually--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--i
do
and...
and
i
can
say
from
my
experience,
i
have
had
very
few
problems
arise
with
confrontation
clause
principles
under
the
roberts
framework.
and...
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
12
years
of
practice,
this
is
the
first
time
i've
ever
seen...
i've
seen
an
interlocking
confession
come
up.
but
i
think
that
the
reason
that--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
and,
your
honor,
i...
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
also,
at
least
the
majority
of
that
court,
believed
that
there
was
a
difference
between
what
the...
mr.
and
mrs.
crawford
were
saying,
but
the...
our
supreme
court
looked
more
closely
at
the
statements
and
observed
that
in
fact
they
were
saying
the
same
thing.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
no,
not
specifically
that...
that
she
said
that
he
wasn't
taking
one
out
because
clearly
she
didn't
say
that.
and
if
in
fact
that
was
the--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--in
part,
and...
and...
but
his
description
did
not
include
a...
a
weapon
either.
both
of
their
descriptions--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--i
believe
that
that
was
that
prosecutor's
interpretation
of...
of
that
evidence,
and
that
is
in
fact
what
he
argued
at
trial.
i
think
he
was
incorrect.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
statement,
it
very...
sylvia
crawford
very
clearly
says
that...
that
the
victim
appeared
that
he
was
reaching
for
something
in
his
pocket.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
no,
your
honor,
i
respectfully--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--and...
and,
your
honor,
as
i
indicated,
so
did
apparently
my
deputy
prosecutor
and
so
did
our
court
of
appeals.
our...
our
supreme
court
read
it
as...
as
i
am.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
well,
she
did
say
those
things,
but
she
also
said
things
that
indicated
that
that
was
not
quite...
quite
correct.
she
also
said,
well,
i
saw
certain
things
going.
i
saw
michael
stab
the
victim.
i
saw
the
victim
doing
these--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--well,
and...
and
i
understand
your
honor's
question
and...
and
position.
one
of
the
things
that
obviously
you
can't
get
out
of
the
flat
piece
of
paper
is...
is
what
her
true
condition
was,
and
that
is
a
problem.
but
i
don't
recall
her
saying
specifically
that
she
was
drunk
at
the...
at
the
time,
merely
that
she
had
been
drinking
and
she
indicated
that
michael
had
been
drinking
as
well.
but
i
don't
know
that--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--well,
because
she
at
the
same...
in
the
same
breath
was
able
to
accurately
describe
the
same
events
that
michael
had
described
in
his
statement.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
and...
and
i
understand
your
honor's
position
on
that.
i...
i
just
respectfully
disagree.
i
don't
think
that
those
factors
by
themselves
necessarily
render
it
to
be
unreliable.
may
i
ask--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
right.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
i
think
at...
at
a
certain
point
the
tougher
you
make
the
standards
for
hearsay
to
come
in,
the
fewer
pieces
of
hearsay
that
are
going
to
come
in.
i
don't
think
that
that's
necessary
in
this
case
because
what...
if...
if
we're
simply
talking
about
interlocking
confessions
and
whether
such
a
thing
exists
and
if
they...
as
the
question
presents,
if
there
will
ever
be
such
a
thing
as
a
confession
that
sufficiently
interlocks
so
that
it
will
be
sufficiently
reliable
to
be
admitted
or
not,
the
court
could
simply
say
there's
just
never
going
to
be
a
situation
that
comes
before
us
where
they
will
interlock
sufficiently
and...
and
be
admittable...
admitted.
mr.
sherman,
on
this
question
of
interlock,
i
know
we've
referred
to
interlock
in
bruton
cases
where
they've
got
joint
trials
of
the
defendants
and
that
sort
of
thing.
what
is
the
strongest
case
you
have
for
the
proposition
that
absent
a
joint
trial,
the
interlocking
nature
of
a
confession...
or
a
statement
is
critical?
i
think
it
would
be
this
case
that's
before
the
court
today,
your
honor.
i
see.
so
none
of
our
precedents
support
that
proposition.
i
think
actually
the
only
time
this
court
has
addressed
the
interlock
theory
on
its
merits--
is
in
the
bruton-type--
--was
in
lee
v.
illinois
when
it
was
simply
the
issue
of
the
interlocking
confession
and
there
wasn't
any
side
issues
of
co-defendants
in
the
same
trial
or
any
of
those
other
issues.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
which
would
seem
to
exclude
interlock--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
and
if
roberts
were
the
only
case
that...
that
the
court
were
to
look
at,
that
i
think
would...
i
would
agree
that
would
be
the
case.
but
in
lee
v.
illinois,
i
think
this
court
very
clearly
accepted...
interpreted
the
concept
of
interlocking
confessions,
and
thereafter
in
cruz
v.
new
york.
but
in
lee,
the
court
actually
set
forth
a
test
to
be
used...
at
least
in
earnest
v.
new
mexico,
the
court
called
it
a
test...
but
a
test
to
be
used
in
determining
when
an
interlocking
confession
can
be
admitted.
now,
that
followed
roberts.
but
wasn't
that
a
joint
trial?
i
can't
remember
for
sure.
i
don't
believe
that
lee
was
a
joint
trial,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
in...
lee
was
a
case
in
which
the
court...
this
court
determined
that
the
confessions
did
not
sufficiently
interlock
to
make
them
reliable
to
be
admitted,
and
also
there
was--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--well,
i...
i
believe
there...
i
don't...
i
don't
recall
there
being
co-defendants
at
trial,
and
i
may
be
mistaken
about
that.
my
recollection
is
that
the...
the
two
holdings
of
lee
were,
one,
that...
that
they
couldn't
be
corroborated
by
other
evidence;
and
two,
that
the
confessions
simply
weren't
sufficiently
interlocking.
and
i
may
be
mistaken.
i
just...
i'm
not
recalling
there
being
co-defendants
tried
at
the
same
time
in
that
particular
case.
but
my
point
being
that
lee,
of
course,
came
after
roberts
and,
in
my
mind,
established
a
third
way
of...
third
form
of...
of
determining
reliability
that
was
separate
from
what
was
in
roberts.
roberts
had
your
indicia
of
reliability
and
your
well-founded
hearsay
exception,
and
then
in
lee
it's
my
perception
that
this
court
formed
a
third
test,
that
being
the
interlocking
confession
rule
test,
and
that--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--that...
that
wasn't
met
in
the
lee
case,
and
that
was
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
and
it
was
our
supreme
court
that
reversed
that
and
said,
no,
we
believe
that
they
did
sufficiently
interlock.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
i
think
perhaps.
i...
i
know
that
in
the
very
least
the
washington
state
supreme
court
interpreted
it
to
be
a
test,
and
i
know
that
in
earnest
v.
new
mexico,
this
court
called
it
a
test
for
determining
when
interlocking
confessions
can
come
in.
so
taking
it
from
both
of
those
cases,
the
washington
supreme
court
in
the
very
least
determined
that
it
was
a
test,
and
in
fact,
in
i
believe
it's
state
v.
rice
said
we
adopt
this
new
test
from...
from
lee
v.
illinois
as
to
interlocking
confessions.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
and...
and
i
can
understand
that
interpretation.
i...
it
just...
i'm...
i'm
certain
that
it's
not
the
interpretation
that
the
washington
state
supreme
court
made,
and
in
fact,
most
courts--
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
--that's
entirely
possible,
your
honor,
and
i'm
certain
that
after
today,
they
will...
they
will
do
so.
[laughter]
the
point...
but
the
point
being
that
if
there
is
not
an
interlocking
confession
rule,
then
there
is
not.
if
this
court
says
we...
there
will
never
be
a
situation
where
one
co-defendant's
confession,
regardless
of
how
identical
it
is
to
the
defendant's,
will
ever
be
reliable
enough,
then
so
be
it.
then
we'll
have
that
test.
it
will
be
straightforward
and
can
be
applied
accordingly.
that,
in
all
candor,
is
the
lesser
of
the
state's
concerns
in
this
coming...
in
this
case
coming
before
this
court
today,
the
primary
concern
of
the
state
actually
being
that
this
court
retain
the
reliability
standard
of...
of
state...
of
ohio
v.
roberts
for
a
variety
of
reasons
that
relate
essentially
to,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
this
underlying
recognition
that
there
are
simply
other
interests
at
stake
other
than
the
defendant's
that
really
need
to
be
addressed.
mr.
steven
c.
sherman
well,
i
have
to
say
that
i
don't
think
this
court
or
any
court
can
make
a
test
that
is
not
going
to
have
some
problems,
and
in
fact,
both
the
petitioner
and
the
learned
professors
admit
that
their
system
have...
has
problems
too.
any
system
is
going
to
have
problems.
the
bugs
are
going
to
have
to
be
worked
out.
it'll
take
years
of...
of
cases,
and
the...
and
the
reality
is...
and
i,
of
course,
mean
no
disrespect
to
any
judge...
anytime
you
get...
you
have
a
judge
making
a
discretionary
decision,
on
the
same
set
of
facts
there's
simply
going
to
be
some
judges
that
will
make
exactly
opposite
decisions
based
upon
the
same
set
of
facts.
that's
just
human
nature.
in
this
case...
and
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
ohio
v.
roberts
is
a
known
quantity,
it's
a
known
entity.
i
haven't
experienced
any
problems
with
its
application
personally
or
in
cases
that
have
been
addressed
at
my
office
since
i've
been
there.
a
new
system
that
is
proposed
by
the
petitioner
and
the
amici
simply
fails
to
take
into
consideration,
as
this
court
did
in
ohio
v.
roberts,
that
there
are
other
rights
and
other
interests
that
are
involved
in
a
criminal
case.
it
doesn't
address
problems
concerning
witnesses
that
become
unavailable
through
no
fault
of
the
state.
yet,
why
should
society
suffer
to
have
a
criminal
defendant
released
simply
because
a
witness
has
become
unavailable?
and
you
know,
you
can't
always
prove
a
defendant
has
made
a
witness
unavailable.
that
is
a
really
tough
standard.
there
are
similar
other
cases
where
particularly
young
witnesses,
who
are
perfectly
capable
of
telling
you
exactly
what
happened
to
them
or
what
they've
seen
in
a
nonconfrontational
setting,
but
yet,
because
of
either
fear
or
intimidation,
they
are
simply
unable
to
come
into
court
and
testify
in
front
of
a
bunch
of
strangers
or
in...
probably
in
front
of
the
very
person
who
is
alleged
to
have
victimized
them.
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
say
a
thing.
yet,
there
needs
to
be
some
way
to
get
what
they
can
say
in
front
of
a
jury.
i...
i
think
that
any
system
that
prohibits
that
is
just
going
to
be
contrary
to
the
interests
of
society
in
general
and
to
the
interests
of
the
other
parties
that...
that
are
involved
in
the
trial
other
than
the
defendant.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
