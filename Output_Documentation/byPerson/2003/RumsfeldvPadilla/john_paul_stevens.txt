justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer
have
joined.
we
agree
that
the
location
of
the
immediate
custodian
should
determine
the
appropriate
forum
in
the
ordinary
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
and
that
prisoner
should
not
be
permitted
to
engage
in
forum
shopping.
in
our
view
however,
this
is
an
exceptional
case
that
merits
exceptional
treatment.
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
filed
by
respondent
padilla
was
in
effect
a
continuation
of
proceedings
initiated
by
the
government,
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
that
is
the
district
where
the
government
had
obtained
the
material
witness
warrant
that
authorized
respondent’s
arrest,
and
where
counsel
had
been
appointed
to
represent
it.
it
was
on
a
sunday,
two
days
before
a
scheduled
hearing
and
the
lawfulness
of
his
detention
that
the
government
made
an
ex
parte
application
to
vacate
the
material
witness
warrant
and
transfer
respondent’s
custody
from
the
justice
department
to
the
defense
department,
and
his
appointed
counsel
had
been
given
notice
of
that
application.
she
undoubtedly
would
have
filed
her
habeas
petition
immediately,
instead
of
two
days
after
respondent
was
removed
from
the
district.
as
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
and
unanimously
held,
the
time
and
efforts
that
councel
and
the
court
had
already
invested
in
the
case,
more
than
amply
justify
the
decision
to
retain
jurisdiction
of
the
controversy
in
new
york.
the
court’s
unnecessarily
strict
application
of
its
immediate
custodian
rule,
needlessly
postpones
the
performance
of
our
duty,
to
answer
questions
that
are
of
profound
importance
to
the
nation.
"at
stake
in
this
case
is
nothing
less
than
the
essence
of
a
free
society.
even
more
important
than
the
method
of
selecting
the
people's
rulers
and
their
successors
is
the
character
of
the
constraints
imposed
on
the
executive
by
the
rule
of
law.
unconstrained
executive
detention
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
and
preventing
subversive
activity
is
the
hallmark
of
the
star
chamber.
access
to
counsel
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
citizen
from
mistakes
and
mistreatment
is
the
hallmark
of
due
process.
executive
detention
of
subversive
citizens,
like
detention
of
enemy
soldiers
to
keep
them
off
the
battlefield,
may
sometimes
be
justified
to
prevent
persons
from
launching
or
becoming
missiles
of
destruction.
it
may
not,
however,
be
justified
by
the
naked
interest
in
using
unlawful
procedures
to
extract
information.
incommunicado
detention
for
months
on
end
is
such
a
procedure.
whether
the
information
so
procured
is
more
or
less
reliable
than
that
acquired
by
more
extreme
forms
of
torture
is
of
no
consequence.
for
if
this
nation
is
to
remain
true
to
the
ideals
symbolized
by
its
flag,
it
must
not
wield
the
tools
of
tyrants
even
to
resist
an
assault
by
the
forces
of
tyranny.
