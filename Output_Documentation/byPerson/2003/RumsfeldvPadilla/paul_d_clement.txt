mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
the
hamdi
case,
which
raised
not
only
the
question
of
the
president's
and
the
military's
authority
to
detain,
but
also
questions
the
process
and
access
to
counsel.
this
case
raises
only
two
relatively
discrete
questions,
first,
whether
the
habeas
petition
in
this
case,
challenging
hamdi's
present
physical
confinement
in
south
carolina,
was
properly
filed
in
manhattan,
rather
than
against
the
immediate
custodian
in
south
carolina,
and
second,
whether
the
president
has
the
authority
to
detain
a
citizen
who
travels
abroad,
affiliates
and
associates
with
the
enemy
abroad,
receives
training
in
enemy
camps
in
wiring
and
explosives
and
then
returns
to
the
united
states
at
the
direction
of
the
enemy
to
commit
hostile
and
warlike
acts.
now,
there
are
many
aspects
of
this
case
that
raise
issues
that
are
really
extraordinary,
but
the
habeas
petition
that
was
filed
in
this
case
was
a
standard,
indeed
ordinary,
use
of
the
writ
to
challenge
the
prisoner's
present
physical
confinement
and
the
habeas
rules
are
settled
that
when
the
writ
is
used
to
challenge
the
present
physical
confinement,
the
proper
custodian,
the
proper
respondent,
is
the
immediate
custodian
and
the
suit
should
be
filed
in
the
district
where
that
custodian
is
present.
in
other
words,
in
a
case
to
your
present
physical
confinement,
the
case
should
be
filed
in
the
district
of
confinement.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
would
be
jurisdiction
in
that
case,
justice
stevens,
under
the
endo
decision.
now,
i
think
in
that
case,
there
would
still
be
a
question,
especially
if
there
was
the,
the
habeas
petition
was
filed
and
he
was
immediately
removed,
there
would
still
be
the
question
of
venue
at
that
point
and
there
is
a
seventh
circuit
case
hat's
not
in
the
briefs
but
ross
against
menday
that
you
may
want
to
look
at
that
says
that
in
a
case
like
that
presumptively--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--oh,
my
answer
is
jurisdiction
yes,
under
this
court's
decision
in
endo.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
then
there
would
still
be
a
subsidiary
question
that's
not
raised
here
about
venue.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly,
and
we
would
raise
in
the
case
where
there
was
in
fact
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
in
this
case
our
position
is
there
is
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
don't
know
which
case
have
you
in
mind,
but
i'm
aware
of
no
case
of
this
court
that
takes
the
unprecedented
step
that
the
court
below
took,
which
is
basically
to
allow
a
habeas
petition
to
go
forward
in
a
case
where
neither
the
prisoner
nor
the
custodian
is
in
the
jurisdiction
where
the
habeas
petition
is
filed.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
was
suggesting
to
justice
stevens,
that
case
involves
a
kind
of
unique
situation
where
a
habeas
petition
is
filed,
challenging
a
certain
kind
of
confinement,
and
then
after
the
petition
is
filed,
and
after
jurisdiction
attaches,
the
prisoner
is
moved.
in
that
case,
it
was
an
individual
moved
from
california
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
know
for
sure,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
would
say
a
couple
of
things.
one
is
on
the
immediate
custodian
rule,
i
think
that
is
a
rule
that
perhaps
the
government
could
waive
in
a
case,
and
so
if
you
have
a
situation--
in
a
way
hamdi
is
that
case
where
when
the
habeas
petition
in
hamdi
was
filed,
he
was
being
detained
in
norfolk,
which
was
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
it
did
not
matter
in
that
case
whether
the
immediate
custodian
was
paulette,
who
is
the
brig,
the
commander
of
the
brig,
or
rumsfeld
because
in
the
government's
view,
they
are
both
territorially
present
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
so
the
immediate
custodian
rule
i
think
is
something
that
government
can
waive.
i
don't
think
that
the
territorial
jurisdiction
limit
on
the
courts,
though,
is
something
that
the
government
is
in
a
position
to
waive.
i
think
that
is
a
restriction
on
the
power
of
the
court
to
issue
the
writ
of
habeas,
and
again,
as
i
was
indicating--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
there
is
a
circuit
split
on
that
issue,
and
i
think
in
some
ways
that
issue
is
sort
of
tied
up
with
this
case,
though
even
there
as
i
understand
most
of
those
cases,
there
is
a
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
called
armantero,
which
in
the
government's
view
goes
the
wrong
way.
there
is
favorable
precedent
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
first
circuit,
and
the
seventh
circuit,
but
even
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think,
envisions
a
case
where
they
view
the
attorney
general
as
the
proper
custodian,
but
they,
you
know,
it's
not
clear
where
they
think
that
individual
can
be
served.
now,
i
suppose
that
the
ninth
circuit
applying
that
rule
might
also
take
the
unprecedented
step
here.
it's
also
true
if
you
want
a
sort
of
sense
of
the
potential
for
abuse
in
these
cases,
i
think
could
you
point
to
the
ninth
circuit
case
where
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
central
district
of
california
had
habeas
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
filed
by
a
petitioner
in
guantanamo.
i
mean,
obviously
there
is
the
issue
that
this
court
has,
but
there
is
a
question
of
if
there
were
jurisdiction,
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
it
lay
in
the
central
district
of
california.
and
i
think
that
happens
when
you
relax
these
traditional
rules.
and
i
think
particularly
in
a
case
like--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
if,
let
me
answer
the
question
this
way,
which
is
if
you
had
a
citizen
in
guantanamo.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
under
this
court's
cases
like
toth
against
quarles
and
burns
against
wilson,
that
citizen
is
unable
to
file
a
habeas
petition.
our
view
is
that
the
proper
place
to
file
that
would
be
either
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
if
you
were
naming
the
secretary
of
defense
or
if
were
you
naming
some
official
present
in
the
district,
you
would
sue
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but
the
important
thing
is
even
in
that
case,
the
court
where
you
filed
the
petition
would
have
jurisdiction,
territorial
jurisdiction
over
the
respondent
and
what
is
so
anomalous
here
is
in
a
sense,
it
doesn't,
i
mean
it
matters
to
us
in
the
sense
that
we
think
the
proper
respondent
is
commander
marr,
but
even
if
you
assume
the
proper
respondent
here
is
secretary
rumsfeld,
the
case
still
shouldn't
be
brought
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
it
should
be
brought
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
only
makes
sense
to
have
the
defense
mounted
in
the
place
where
the
detention
is
taking
place.
and
i
think
that's
particularly
true
in
this
case,
because
this
isn't
a
petition
that
only
challenges
the
fact
of
confinement.
if
you
look
at
the,
the
petition
in
this
case,
the
amended
petition,
joint
appendix
page
56,
the
relief
that's
sought
here
also
goes
to
the
conditions
of
confinement
in
commander
marr's
brig.
now,
in
a
case
like
that,
it
seems--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
you
can
file
a
mixed
petition
and
seek
that
kind
of
relief,
but
in
any
event,
i
think
that
what
they
are
looking
for
is
not
just
release
from
detention,
but
the
stopping
of
the
interrogations.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
mean,
unless
the
word
essentially
is
going
to
bear
a
tremendous
amount
of
weight,
i
disagree
because
i
think
that
what
you
have
here
is
not
general
venue
principles.
you
have
a
situation
where
the
relevant
statute
that
gives
courts
habeas
jurisdiction
restricts
their
ability
to
issue
the
writ
to
their
territorial
jurisdiction.
and
this
court
has
been
clear
in
cases
like
carbo
and
this
is
even
consistent
in
justice
rutledge's
dissent
in
the
ahrens
case,
that
for
that
provision
to
have
any
meaning
at
an
irreducible
minimum,
it
has
to
mean
that
a
writ
that
goes
to
the
proper
custodian
has
to
be
filed
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
and
this
court
decided
that
in
endo
long
before
ahrens
when
it
reaffirmed
an
even
stricter
rule
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
post-ahrens
cases
that
suggests
that
this
court
has
ever
deviated
from
this
understanding.
and
indeed
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
decision
in
schlanger
against
seamans,
because
i
think
in
some
ways,
it
shows
how,
that
that
case
really
decided
this
issue,
because
what
the
court
there
had
was
an
individual
who
was
trying
to
get
rotc
scholarship
in
arizona,
but
he
was
assigned
to
a
unit
in
alabama,
and
he
filed
his
habeas
petition
in
arizona,
and
he
named
as
respondents
an
individual
in
arizona
who
had
no
custody
over
him
whatsoever,
so
that
individual
was
out.
he
also
named
the
secretary
of
the
air
force.
the
court
did
not
rely
on
that,
and
the
court
said
that
his
true
custodian
is
his
commanding
officer
in
georgia,
and
what
this
court
said
is
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
arizona
over
that
custodian
in
georgia,
and
just
to
be
clear
about
it,
the
court
noted
and
rejected
an
argument
based
on
28
u.s.c.
1391(e),
which
among
other
things
provides
nationwide
service
of
process
against
federal
officials.
now,
if
that
statute
had
applied,
then
it
would
have
been
perfectly
appropriate
to
bring
the
case
in
arizona
against
a
georgia
respondent
who
was
a
federal
officer.
but
the
court
said
no.
1391(e)
does
not
trump
the
habeas
statute.
now,
if
that
is
true
of
a
federal
statute
that
provides
for
nationwide
service
of
process,
it
seems
like
it
would
be
true
a
fortiori
for
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
4.
but
that's
the
theory
under
which
the
courts
below
exercised
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
that,
there
is
two
things
i'd
like
to
point
to.
but
maybe
the
simplest
way
is
that
both
strait
and
braden
cite
schlanger
favorably
and,
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
very
end
of
the
braden
opinion,
when
the
court
says
that
the
proper
respondent
there
is
within
the
court's
service
of
process,
it
sites
schlanger
for
that
proposition,
which
makes
sense
because
in
that
case
the
petition
was
properly
filed,
challenging
a
kentucky
detainer
in
kentucky,
so
the
proper
respondent
was
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
that
case.
the
second
reason
i
would
say
that
schlanger
is
very
much
good
law
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
is
that
the
court
in
schlanger
went
out
of
its
way,
because
at
that
point,
ahrens
was
sort
of
already
teetering
on
the
verge
of
obsolescence,
to
state
that
the
rule
would
be
exactly
the
same
even
under
justice
rutledge's
view
in
ahrens,
so
i
think
for
those
two
reasons,
schlanger
continues
to
be
good
law,
and
clearly
would
trump
any
service
of
process
that
would
be
provided
by
rule
4.
and
i
think,
and
this
is
consistent
with
what
the
unanimous
three-judge
court
in
the
fourth
circuit
said
in
the
hamdi
case,
that
particularly
in
cases
that
raise
such
sensitive
issues
as
the
cases
that
are
involved
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
it
is
particularly
important
that
the
court
try
to
avoid
unnecessarily
reaching
constitutional
issues
by
first
ascertaining
that
it
has
jurisdiction.
now,
if
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
ginsburg,
its
statutory
jurisdiction,
but
i
agree.
it
is
at
some
level
it
is
a
which
district
court
question,
not
whether
district
courts
are
open
to
these
claims
at
all.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
breyer,
i
would
disagree.
i
think
that
this
court,
it
is
true,
in
situations
where
it
has
relaxed
the
notion
of
custody,
and
has
allowed
habeas
petitions
to
be
brought
in
circumstances
where
they
previously
weren't
available,
strait
against
laird
is
an
example.
this
court's
decision
in
braden,
basically
is
an
example
because
it
was
accommodating
the
overruling
of
mcnally
against
hill
and
payton
against
rowe.
so
in
those
contexts,
where
there
is
more
than
one
custody
or
some
kind
of
metaphysical
custody,
this
court
has
relaxed
the
rules
in
a
way
to
accommodate
those,
but
it
has
never
deviated.
never,
from
the
rule
that
you
have
to
file
the
habeas
petition
where
the
custodian
is,
and
equally
important,
it
has
never,
there
is
no
need
to
expand
the
notion
of
custody,
because
you
have
a
classic
habeas
case
where
you
are
challenging
your
present
physical
confinement.
the
courts
never
relax
the
rules.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
would
be
fine.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
breyer,
i
will
answer
the
question.
i
would
preface
it
by
saying
that
i
certainly
wouldn't
read
the
authorization
of
force's
use
of
the
term
necessary
and
appropriate
as
an
invitation
for
sort
of
judicial
management
of
the
executive's
war-making
power.
i
would
have
viewed
it
as
a
delegation
to
the
executive
to
use
its
traditional
authority
to
make
discretionary
judgments
in
finding
what
is
the
necessary
appropriate
force.
and
the
prize
cases,
i
think,
stand
for
that
proposition.
now,
if
i
can
address
the
specifics,
though,
why
it
might
be
necessary
and
appropriate
and,
indeed,
why
is
this
government
asserting
this
authority?
it
is
precisely
because,
in
this
war
on
terrorism,
the
government
can
confront
an
individual
who
is
not
only
guilty
of
past
war
crimes,
but
also--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--even
if,
contrary
to
our
position,
it
was
a
venue
question,
we
would
still
say
no.
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
understand...
i
mean,
the
fact
that
he
was
in
new
york
in
the
first
place
is
a
bit
of
a
happenstance.
he
tries
to
fly
to
chicago.
he
is
seized
in
chicago--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
anybody
would
think
that
if
you
filed
a
habeas
petition
to
challenge
padilla's
detention
as
a
material
witness
while
he
was
being
detained
in
new
york,
that
that
should
be
filed
in
chicago.
and
i
think
by
the
same
logic,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
from
what
the
gravamen
of
the...
the
gravamen
of
the
challenge
is
to
the
conditions
and
legality
of
the
detention
in
south
carolina,
why
that
ought
to
be
filed
in
new
york
just
because
he
was
there
under
a
different
authority.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
he
did
have
a
lawyer
appointed
there.
but
again,
i
don't
think...
i
mean,
i
think
mr.
dunham
or
his
equivalent
in
south
carolina
would
be
available
to
provide
whatever
role
is
necessary
and
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
i
don't
think
there
are
only
lawyers
in
new
york.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
in
none
of
these
cases
have
we
seen
a
problem
with
the
detainees
finding
legal
representation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
hate
to
disappoint
you.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
had
anything
in
particular
left
other
than
to
say
that
we
would
still...
i
mean,
i
think
all
i
would
say,
and
maybe
i
can
reference
that
there
are
court
of
appeals
cases,
the
seventh
circuit
has
decided
this
ross
against
menday
case
that
basically
say
that
even
if
you're
in
a
venue
situation,
even
if
you're
within
the
rule
of
ex
parte
endo,
there
is
still
a
strong,
strong
presumption
that
a
habeas
petition
belongs
in
the
district
court
where
the
individual
is
being
detained.
now,
maybe
if
you
had
a
situation
where
the
habeas
petition
was
up
and
running
and
close
to
a
final
judgment
or
whatever.
and
then
the
individual
is
detained,
it
makes
sense
to
keep
the
proceeding
in
the
first
venue.
but
in
a
case
like...
if
you
had
a
case
where
the
day
after
the
first
petition
is
filed,
he's
moved
for
independent
and
good
reasons,
i
think
you
would
also
say
that
the
case
belongs
in
the
place
of
detention.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
for
purposes
of
the
question
before
this
court,
the
authority
question,
he
is
just
the
same.
it
may
be
that
in
an
appropriate
juncture
when
the
court
has
before
it
the
question
of
what
procedure
should
be
applied,
that
you
would
want
to
apply
different
procedures
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
could
we
punish
him?
certainly
we
could
punish
him
if
we
decided
to
change
the
nature
of
our
processing
of
him.
as
this
court
made
clear
in
quirin--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
don't
think
we
could
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--not
after
we
captured
them
and
brought
them
to
safety.
and
i
think
in
every
case,
there
are
rules
of
engagement,
there
are
rules
for
the
appropriate
force
that
should
be
used.
and
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
even
if
they're
an
unlawful
belligerent.
once
they're...
i
mean,
we
couldn't
take
somebody
like
hamdi,
for
example,
now
that
he's
been
removed
from
the
battlefield
and
is
completely...
poses
no
threat
unless
he's
released
and
use
that
kind
of
force
on
him.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
first
of
all,
there
are
treaty
obligations.
but
the
primary
check
is
that
just
as
in
every
other
war,
if
a
u.s.
military
person
commits
a
war
crime
by
creating
some
atrocity
on
a
harmless,
you
know,
detained
enemy
combatant
or
a
prisoner
of
war,
that
violates
our
own
conception
of
what's
a
war
crime.
and
we'll
put
that
u.s.
military
officer
on
trial
in
a
court
marshal.
so
i
think
there
are
plenty
of
internal
reasons--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
our
executive
doesn't
and
i
think...
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--this
is
a
situation
where
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
habeas
courts.
so
if
necessary,
they
remain
open.
but
i
think
it's
very
important...
i
mean,
the
court
in
ludecke
against
watkins
made
clear
that
the
fact
that
executive
discretion
in
a
war
situation
can
be
abused
is
not
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
judicial
micromanagement
and
overseeing
of
that
authority.
you
have
to
recognize
that
in
situations
where
there
is
a
war...
where
the
government
is
on
a
war
footing,
that
you
have
to
trust
the
executive
to
make
the
kind
of
quintessential
military
judgments
that
are
involved
in
things
like
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
give
you
a
practical
reason
answer
and
the
legal
reason.
you
may
prefer
the
former.
but
i
think
that
the
practical
reason
is
if
you
capture
somebody
who
is
not
just
somebody
who
is
guilty
of
a
war
crime
or
a
violation
of
some
provision
of
title
18,
but
also
has
a
wealth
of
information
that
could
be
used
to
prevent
future
terrorist
attacks,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
military
ought
to
have
the
option
of
proceeding
with
him
in
a
way
that
allows
him
to
get
actionable
intelligence
to
prevent
future
terrorist
attacks,
and
should
not
be
forced
into
a
choice
where
the
only
way
they
can
proceed
is
to
proceed
retrospectively
to
try
to
punish
him
for
past
acts.
in
doing
so,
whether
it's
a
military
commission
or
an
article
iii,
requires
you
to
give
him
a
counsel
who
likely
is
going
to
say
that
you
shouldn't
talk
to
the
government
about
any
of
these
things.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
he
might
well,
justice
souter,
and
you
in
fact
suggested
that
yourself,
which
is
if
there
was
actionable
information--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
he
would
certainly
today,
which
is
to
say
september
12th
or
april
28th.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
would
be
my
answer.
i
would
say
the
president
had
that
authority
on
september
10th,
but
i
guess
i
would--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
but
justice
scalia,
presumably
the
authorization
of
force
is
read
against
prior
history
and
this
court's
precedents.
and
those
precedents
include
the
quirin
case
where
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
in
fighting
a
war,
you
have
the
authority
to
detain
individuals,
even
if
they're
not
formal
military
officers
who
are
affiliated
with
the
enemy
and
come
into
the
united
states
intent
on
committing
hostile
and
warlike
acts.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
two
things,
justice
souter.
first
of
all,
i
mean,
you
asked
me
a
hypothetical
but
we
do
have
the
authorization
of
force
here.
second
of
all,
i
don't
think
quirin
can
stand
for
the
kind
of
clear
statement
rule
that
others
want
to
attribute
to
it
for
two
reasons.
one,
to
the
extent
it
applied
any
clear
statement
rule,
it
runs
in
the
opposite
direction.
the
court
said
they
would
not
strike
down
the
detention
and
try
the
individuals
there
absent
a
clear
conviction
that
it
violated
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it
actually...
it
purported
to
be.
it
said
absent
a
clear
conviction,
it
wouldn't
strike
down
the
authority.
but
what
i
would...
just
to
be
clear,
i
think
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
if
you
applied
a
clear
statement
rule
to
quirin,
it
would
have
to
come
out
the
other
way
because
article
ii
of
the
articles
of
war
that
were
in
force
at
the
time
were
restricted
to
members
of
the
united
states
military.
article
15,
which
the
court
relied
on,
didn't
expressly
authorize
military
commissions
expressly.
it
did
so
by
negative
implication.
so
it's
simply
not
the
case
that
you
need
an
express
statutory
authorization.
if
i
could
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
just
three
points.
first,
on
jurisdiction,
it
is
true
that
the
immediate
custodian
rule
is
not
a
hard
and
fast
rule
and
it
has
been...
exceptions
have
been
made.
but
the
territorial
jurisdiction
rule,
as
statutorily
prescribed,
limits
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
is
a
hard
and
fast
rule.
and
the
best
evidence
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
is
in
those
cases
where
you
had
to
relax
one
or
the
other,
when
you
had
a
citizen
detained
abroad
where
the
immediate
custodian
was
abroad
outside
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
any
district
court,
rather
than
relax
the
rule
of
territorial
jurisdiction,
the
court
said
you
could
sue
the
secretary
of
defense
in
a
district
where
there
is
territorial
jurisdiction
over
the
individual.
it
is
true
there
are
situations
like
strait
against
laird
that
don't
involve
normal
physical
confinement,
where
the
court
has
had
to
come
up
with
some
rule
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
you
only
have
a
metaphysical
custodian.
but
in
the
case
of
a
physical
detention
of
an
individual,
the
court
has
never
relaxed
the
rule
that
you
file
it
in
the
district
where
the
immediate
custodian
is
located.
and
if
you
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
carbo
and
justice
rutledge's
dissent
in
ahrens,
you'll
see
that
if
you
don't
respect
the
rule
in
a
situation
like
this,
there
is
nothing
left
to
the
statutory
language
and
nothing
left
of
the
intent
of
the
congress
that
passed
it.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
in
looking
at
this
case
and
the
authority
that's
asserted
and
the
role
of
4001(a),
it's
important
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
civilian
authority
and
the
military
authority
over
enemy
combatants.
this
court,
when
it
decided
endo
and
addressed
the
situation
of
the
detention
of
the
japanese,
specifically
carved
out
the
situation
of
the
military
detention
of
enemy
combatants
and
said
that
that
is
not
involved
here.
it
stands
to
reason
that
if
congress,
in
passing
4001(a)
to
effectively
prevent
another
japanese
internment
camp
of
concededly
loyal
citizens
also
probably
wanted
to
put
to
one
side
the
issue
of
military
detention
of
enemy
combatants.
in
any
event,
the
court
need
not
ultimately
decide
whether
4001(a)
has
any
application
because
the
authorization
of
force
clearly
provides
the
necessary
act
of
congress.
it
authorizes
not
article
iii
courts
for
these
individuals.
it
authorizes
military
force.
and
the
relevant
line
here
is
provided
this
court's
case
in
quirin,
when
somebody
goes
abroad,
associates
with
the
enemy,
takes
weapons
training
or
explosives
training
with
the
enemy,
and
then
returns
to
the
united
states
with
the
intent
to
commit
hostile
and
warlike
acts
at
the
direction
of
the
enemy,
that
classically
falls
within
the
quirin
side
of
the
line.
it's
much
different
than
a
landon
milligan
who
never
left
the
state
of
indiana.
and
the
military
has
authority
over
that
individual.
lastly,
let
me
just
address
the
argument
that
somehow
you
can
constrain
the
authorization
of
force
and
read
it
only
to
apply
in
a
battlefield
setting.
with
respect,
i
think
that
ignores
the
context
in
which
it
was
passed.
it
was
passed
seven
days
after
september
11th.
the
resolution
itself
recognizes
that
we
face
continuing
threats
at
home
and
abroad.
it
was
not
passed
as
a
matter
of
retribution
for
those
attacks,
but
to
prevent
future
attacks.
to
read
it
to
deny
the
government
the
authority
to
detain
a
latter
day
citizen
version
of
mohammed
atta
is
to
simply
ignore
the
will
of
congress.
thank
you,
your
honor.
