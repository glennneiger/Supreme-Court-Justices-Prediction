unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point,
mr.
clement,
supposing
this
petition
had
been
filed
while
he
was
still
in
new
york,
and
then
he
was
removed
to
south
carolina.
would
the
petition
be
okay,
then?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
your
answer
is
to
my
question.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
which
the
government
would
presumably
would
be
free
to
raise.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
jurisdiction
under
the
habeas
statutes
has
been
a
bit
of
a
confusion
because,
for
instance,
on
behalf
of
aliens,
i
think
we
have
allowed
jurisdiction
to
be
obtained
in
the
manner
it
was
here,
have
we
not?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
ex
parte
endo?
unknown
speaker
they
never,
they
never
named
any
custodian
in
that
case,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
circuit
split
on
whether
aliens
can
name
the
attorney
general?
unknown
speaker
where
does
jurisdiction
lie
for
someone
in
guantanamo,
do
you
suppose?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
why?
why,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
government
where
they
defend?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
there
are
offices
all
over
the
country.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i'm
not
sure
that's,
that's
appropriate
relief
in
a
habeas
petition,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
--how
this
particular
case
was
pleaded,
which
it
wasn't,
because
we
don't
have
any
flushing
out
of
this,
but
you
keep
talking
about
jurisdiction
and
it
seems
to
me,
this
is
essentially
a
venue
question.
there
is
no
question
that
federal
courts
have
habeas
jurisdiction.
they
have
that
authority.
and
you
are
talking
about
not
the
large
question,
what
kind
of
case
can
a
federal
court
hear,
you
are
talking
about
a
where
question,
not
a
what
question.
so
it's
essentially
a
venue
question.
unknown
speaker
although,
if
the
prisoner
is
moved,
so
prisoner
goes
someplace
else,
they
still
have
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
although
the
original
custodian
no
longer
has
the
prisoner
in
his
or
her
care.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
clement,
is
schlanger
still
good
law
after
strait
and
braden?
unknown
speaker
you
recognize
that
it
isn't
a
jurisdiction
question
like,
can
the
federal
courts
entertain
this
kind
of
suit.
can
they
entertain
a
fender
bender
between
people
from
the
same
state?
no.
can
they
entertain
federal
habeas
cases.
so
we
have
one
federal
system,
and
there
are
classes
of
cases
that
can
go
into
that
system
and
then
we
have
an
allocation
of
where,
so
this
isn't
jurisdiction
writ
large,
it
is
where
in
this
federal
system
do
you
bring
this
case?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
if
it's
a
which
district
court
question,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
long
you
want
to
spend
on
the
procedural
issue,
but
i
take
it
if
we
follow
your
thing,
never
can
you
entertain
a
habeas
petition
unless
the
body
is
in
this
district,
then
immigration
cases,
military
cases
are
going
to
be
a
nightmare.
if
we
follow
a
venue
principle,
you
are
going
to
get
just
the
right
result,
which
is
we
bring
the
case
where
it's
most
convenient.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
question
to
get
you
to
the
merits,
if
i
can.
unknown
speaker
suppose,
suppose
that
you're
right
about
your
basic
claim
that
the
uniform,
what
is
it
called,
the
use
of
force
act
is
in
fact
a
statute
of
the
kind
contemplated
in
4001.
still,
the
words
in
that
act
are,
they
can
use
necessary
and
appropriate
force.
so
why
would
it
be
necessary
and
appropriate
in
a
country
that
has
its
courts
open,
that
has
regular
criminal
proceedings,
that
has
all
the
possibility
of
adjudicating
a
claim
that
i'm
the
wrong
person?
why
is
it
a
necessary
and
appropriate
thing
to
do
once
you
have
such
a
person
who
is
a
citizen
in
this
country
to
proceed
by
other
than
a
normal
court
procedure?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
just
one
last
question
on
the
jurisdictional
issue?
if
you
assume
it's
a
question
of
venue
rather
than
jurisdiction...
i
know
you're
arguing
in
the
alternative,
but
if
you
assume
it
was
venue
rather
than
jurisdiction,
would
new
york
not
have
been
the
proper
venue
since
he
was
held
there
as
a
material
witness
and
he
had
a
lawyer
appointed
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
government
is
responsible
for
him
being
in
new
york,
which
it
seems
to
me,
that
they
should
not
be
complaining
about
litigating
there.
unknown
speaker
he
had
a
lawyer
appointed,
didn't
he,
there?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it's
a
little
easier
for
the
government
to
find
a
lawyer
wherever
it
needs
it
than
it
would
be
for
a
prisoner
being
moved
from
district
to
district.
unknown
speaker
getting
back
to
the
merits,
merits
part--
--could
i
hear
his
answer
to
the
previous
question?
you
were
in
the
middle
of
an
answer
and
i
was
waiting
for
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
what
rights
does
padilla
have,
if
any,
in
your
view,
that
a
belligerent
who
is
apprehended
on
the
battlefield
does
not
have?
is
padilla
just
the
same
as
somebody
you
catch
in
afghanistan?
unknown
speaker
can
we
punish
him?
unknown
speaker
would
you
shoot
him
when
he
got
off
the
plane?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
you
could
shoot
someone
that
you
had
captured
on
the
field
of
battle.
unknown
speaker
if
they're
an
unlawful
belligerent?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
law
is
what
the
executive
says
it
is,
whatever
is
necessary
and
appropriate
in
the
executive's
judgment,
as
the
resolution
you
gave
us
that
congress
passed,
and
it
leads
you
up
to
the
executive,
unchecked
by
the
judiciary.
so
what
is
it
that
would
be
a
check
against
torture?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
executive
says
mild
torture
we
think
will
help
get
this
information.
it's
not
a
soldier
who
does
something
against
the
code
of
military
justice,
but
it's
an
executive
command.
some
systems
do
that
to
get
information.
unknown
speaker
what's
constraining?
that's
the
point.
is
it
just
up
to
the
good
will
of
the
executive?
is
there
any
judicial
check?
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
it
that
military...
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
i'm
trying
to
push
you
down
the
road
a
bit.
and
maybe
we
don't
have
to
decide
this
now.
but
i
want
to
understand
your
vision
of
it.
i
mean,
a
person
has
come
to
the
united
states.
he
has,
according
to
the
government,
committed
a
serious
crime
and
is
dangerous.
well,
those
are
people
we
deal
with
all
the
time
in
the
criminal
process.
so
if
you're
even
assuming
this
resolution
authorizes
some
kind
of
force,
why
isn't
the
appropriate
force,
where
he's
in
the
united
states
and
the
courts
are
open,
what
we
would
call
ordinary
criminal
process?
i
mean,
that
harmonizes
everything.
now,
maybe
there
is
an
answer
to
that
in
your
vision.
i
want
to
find
out
your
vision
of
what's
supposed
to
happen
here
and
why.
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
that
authority
in
the
absence
of
the
authorizing
resolution?
would
the
president
have
that
authority?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
suggested
that
he
might
have
on
september
12th.
i
don't
think
my
suggestion
went
much
further.
but
i'll
grant
you
that's
an
argument,
but
do
you
believe
he
would
have
that
authority
today
in
the
absence
of
the
authorizing
resolution?
unknown
speaker
two
and
a
half
months
later.
but
i
mean,
based
on
the
rationale
that
there
is
a
need
to
bar
him
from
what
would
be
the
normal
process
that
justice
breyer
is
describing
because
of
the
need
to
interrogate
effectively.
your
answer,
i
take
it,
is
he
would
have
that
authority
even
without
the
authorizing
resolution?
unknown
speaker
how
does
he
get
that
from
just
being
commander-in-chief?
i
mean,
i
understand
the
commander-in-chief
power
to
be
a
power
over
the
military
forces,
when
they're
being
used
as
military
forces,
the
general
washington
power,
you
know,
to
command
the
forces
tactically
and
everything
else.
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
has
power
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
win
the
war.
i
mean,
the
steel
seizure
case
demonstrates
that
well
enough.
how
does
this
come
within
george
washington's
commander-in-chief
power,
which
is
what
i
read
this
congressional
resolution
to
be
directed
at?
it
doesn't
say
you
can
do
whatever
it
takes
to
win
the
war.
unknown
speaker
but
quirin
rested
on
the
fact
that
there
was
congressional
authorization
for
a
military
commission
to
try
on
such
charges.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
would
settle,
as
a
rhetorical
point,
for
the
fact
that
it's
not
a
clear
statement
for
you
either.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
clement.
ms.
martinez,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
martinez,
the
authorization
passed
by
congress
is
quite
broad
and
it
talks
about
force
against
individuals.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
surely
don't
think
that
it
excluded
american
citizens.
i
mean,
certainly
it
gave
the
president
authority
to
wage
war
against
american
citizens
if
they're
on
the
other
side,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
whatever
authority
it
gave
him,
there
is
no
indication
that
it's
limited
to
non-citizens.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
that
4001
prevents
the
president
from
detaining
on
the
battlefield?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
doesn't
mean
what
you
just
said
it
meant.
unknown
speaker
so
the
clear
statement
rule
doesn't
apply
to
4001?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
were
arguing
for
the
clear
statement
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
your
qualification
is
only
implied
from
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
what
about
hijackers?
the
resolution
has
to
do
with
9/11.
and
the
people
were
hijackers
and
a
lot
of
the
hijackers
are
up
in
the
airplane
and
then
they
land.
do
you
think
that
the
resolution
wasn't
aimed
at
them
in
part?
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
are
captured
on
the
battlefield
and
then
brought
here,
4001
clicks
into
operation,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes?
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
were--
--so
if
we
found
american
citizens
in
iraq
who
were
firing
on
our
forces
and
brought
them
back
here,
they
would
have
to
be
given
an
article
iii
trial?
unknown
speaker
what
about
my
question
on
iraq?
unknown
speaker
what
distinguishes
citizen?
if
we
are
talking
about
someone
like
padilla,
who
is
in
the
united
states,
the
due
process
clause
refers
to
person,
not
citizen.
so
i
can
see
a
distinction
between
brought
into
the
united
states,
but
within
the
united
states,
if
it's
someone
who
is,
is
an
alien,
but
is
here
with
permission,
a
resident
alien,
say--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let's
get
to
that
question.
let's
assume
that
we
disagree
with
you
about
4001,
and
we
think
the
authorization
for
use
of
military
force
supersedes
that.
then
what,
then
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
your
client?
unknown
speaker
so
the
principle
would
be
that
if
somebody
is
like
a
missile
sent
over
here,
you
know,
he
is
actually
one
of
the
hijackers
or
the
equivalent
thereof,
that's
an
obvious
limiting
principle,
that
people
who
are
sent
offshore,
sent
right
over
here
and
we
catch
them
in
mid-air.
unknown
speaker
declarations
of
war
are
just
not
written
this
way.
the
iraq
declaration
is
not.
the
recent
declarations
of
war,
formal
declarations
are
not,
and
amuf
is
not.
unknown
speaker
that's
just
not
the
tradition.
the
president
is
given
the
authority.
unknown
speaker
well,
endo
was
concededly
loyal,
and
duncan
were
civil
crimes,
a
stockbroker
who
was
embezzling,
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
can
you
give
me
a
minute
or
so
on
the,
or
as
long
as
you
want
or
short,
but
suppose
you
get
to
the
similar
place
by
saying
that
this
resolution,
suppose
hypothetically,
i'm
not
saying
what
my
view
is,
but
hypothetically,
suppose
you
get
to
the
same
place
by
saying,
yes,
that
wartime
resolution
still
doesn't
authorize
departing
from
use
of
the
criminal
system,
the
ordinary
criminal
system
for
somebody
in
the
united
states,
but
for
an
unusually
good
reason.
now,
we
have
two
possible
reasons
advanced,
one
orally
that
we
need
to
question
him,
and
one
in
the
briefs,
a
suggestion
that
this
man
is
a
ticking
time
bomb,
and
we
can't
reveal
the
evidence
without
destroying
intelligence.
now,
i'd
like
your
vision
of
how
this
is
supposed
to
play
out
under
an
ordinary
criminal
system
in
response
perhaps
to
what
those
claims
are.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be,
of
course,
perhaps,
desirable,
but
we
are
faced
with
a
situation
of
the
here
and
now,
and
what
do
we
do?
unknown
speaker
we
just
turn
loose
a
ticking
time
bomb?
unknown
speaker
are
you...
are
you
suggesting
then
that
this
case
might
be
an
exception
to
some
more
general
rule
because
of
the
peculiar
facts
that
you
have
just
recited?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
there
should
be
some
more
definite
rule.
supposing
we
were
to
say
that
generally
it's
the
secretary
of
defense
and
his
venue
is
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they
have
certainly
challenged
the
proper
custodian
here.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
change
it
from
jurisdiction
to
venue.
i
mean,
venue
is
venue
and
jurisdiction
is
jurisdiction.
you
may
say
that
the
jurisdictional
rule
has
been
so
haphazard
that
effectively
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
and
that
argument
will
stand
and
fall
on
the
basis
of
the
cases
that
you
and
mr.
clement
have
discussed.
but
to
say
that
this
is,
this
is
venue
is
simply
wrong.
i
mean,
it
is
a
matter
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
and
it's
always
been
treated
by
that
way
in
our
opinions.
we
have
not
discussed
it
as
a
venue
rule.
well,
your
honor,
i
do
agree
that
there
is
a
jurisdictional
question,
and
we
agreed
that...
we
argued
that
jurisdiction
is
proper.
but
what
braden
says
is
that
the
rule
that
ahrens
had
announced
as
a
hard
and
fast
jurisdictional
rule
reflected
nothing
more
than
traditional
venue
concerns.
and
so
braden
specifically
says
that
that...
that
which
was
discussed
in
ahrens
went
to
venue
and
not
to
jurisdiction.
returning--
--where
you
had
conceivably
proper
jurisdiction
in
several
places.
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
if
we
are
using
the
jurisdictional
label,
it's
personal
jurisdiction,
and
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
basis
of
the,
of
the
congressional
authorization.
he
is
not
claiming
it
just
by
virtue
of
executive
power.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
since
they
are,
since
they
are
both
the
weakest...
weakest
claim
is
probably
solely
the
executive.
but
i
think
you
have
to
deal
with
the
claim
that
it's
congressional
authorization.
unknown
speaker
the
trouble
is,
i
don't
see
how
you
can...
i
mean,
i
think
i
can
understand
your
saying
it
doesn't
give
him
any
power
except
a
battlefield
power.
i
can
understand
that.
you
might
read
it
that
way.
but
i
can't
understand
reading
it
to
say
it
applies
to
everybody,
but
not
to
united
states
citizens.
that
line
is
just
not
there
in
the
resolution.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
apply
to
aliens.
we...
the
president
could
use
force
against
aliens
under
that
resolution.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
you
are
proposing
to
us
an
interpretation
of
the
resolution,
which
i
suggest
makes
no
sense,
unless
you
are
willing
to
say
that
it
also
doesn't
apply
to
aliens
that
are
being
brought...
that
are
committing
these
acts
within
the
country.
unknown
speaker
he
might
have
the
power
to
take
up
the
aliens
and
arrest
them
any
way
because
4001
doesn't
prohibit
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
point?
unknown
speaker
then
i
take
it
then
you
have
no,
assuming...
assuming
that
4001
has
been
superseded
by
the
authorization.
i
assume
you
have
no
principal
basis
for
distinguishing
between
citizens
and
aliens
insofar
as
detaining
an
enemy
belligerent?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
make
no
distinction
between
the
two.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
has
no
application
on
the
battlefield
because
of
the
principle
of
no
extraterritorial
effect
of
united
states
statutes?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
if
you
capture
an
american
combatant
and
bring
him
back
to
the
united
states,
then
4001--
unknown
speaker
--it
would
apply?
unknown
speaker
did
congress
at
the
time
of
4001
consider
other
systems
that
do
allow
for
preventative
detention,
but
then
require
the
person
periodically
to
be
brought
before
a
judge
to
make
certain
that
the
conditions
still
exist,
like,
as
is
alleged
in
this
case,
to
need
to
get
evidence?
unknown
speaker
the
reason...
and
this
is
why
i've
been
harping
on
this
thing
of
necessary
and
appropriate.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
take
into
account
the
traditions
of
the
united
states
ordinary
criminal
processes,
and
you
say,
well,
the
forces
act,
the
use
of
force
act,
doesn't
apply
at
all,
then
there
is
no
way
to
take
care
of
the
real
emergency,
the
real
emergency,
the
real
ticking
time
bomb,
et
cetera,
except
to
go
back
to
congress,
which
may
or
may
not
act.
but
if
you
get
to
the
same
result
by
reading
the
necessary
and
appropriate
thing
to
take
into
account
our
traditions,
you
do
leave
the
opening
there
for
the
possibility
of
a
real
emergency
which
would
warrant
an
extraordinary
proceeding.
i'm
just
exposing
my
thought
on
this
so
that
i
can
get
your
reaction.
unknown
speaker
so
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
the
resolution
was
inadequate
to
continue
to
hold
your
client
in
the
manner
in
which
he
is
being
held,
even
on
the
day
in
which
it
was
passed?
this
is
not
a
two
and
a
half
years
later
argument,
it
would
be
an
argument
on
the
day
it
was
passed?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
you.
but
you
would
not
necessarily
have
objected,
let's
say,
a
week
after
september
11th,
even
though
there
was
no
resolution?
unknown
speaker
let
me
interrupt.
when
you
say
it
is
clear
he
could
do
it
if
the
defendant
was
about
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
conduct,
by
what
standard
would
you
decide
that
he
was
about
to?
probable
cause,
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
just
suspicion?
unknown
speaker
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
confidential
intelligence
would
not
be
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
that's
really
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard,
then,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
just
say
two
years.
you
would
certainly
say
that
as
soon
as
the
president
prevented
the
act
that
he
feared
by
taking
the
person
into
custody,
he
immediately
had
no
more
authority
to
detain
him,
wouldn't
you?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--that's
the
way
the
statute
you're
relying
on
reads,
that
he
shall
not
be
detained.
so
two
years
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
unknown
speaker
the
next
day
he
should,
i
suppose,
you
know,
hand
him
over
to
civil
prosecution
authorities.
unknown
speaker
but
we
are
not
just
talking
about
terrorists
here.
we're
talking
about
terrorists
associated
with
foreign
forces.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
judge
mukasey's
solution
for
this
case
was
not
adequate,
then?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
martinez.
and
mr.
clement,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
