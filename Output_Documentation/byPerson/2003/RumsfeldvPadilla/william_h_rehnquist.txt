we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
03-1027,
donald
rumsfeld
versus
jose
padilla.
mr.

chief

william

i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
03-1027,
rumsfeld
v.
padilla.
in
may
2002,
respondent
padilla,
an
american
citizen,
was
arrested
at
chicago's
o'hare
airport.
he
had
just
returned
from
pakistan
where
he
allegedly
conspired
with
al
qaeda
to
carry
out
terrorist
attacks
within
the
united
states.
padilla
was
held
in
federal
custody
in
new
york
city
in
connection
with
the
southern
district
of
new
york’s
grand
jury
investigation
into
the
september
11th
attacks.
on
june
9th
2002,
however,
president
bush
issued
an
order
designating
padilla
as
an
“enemy
combatant”
and
directing
rumsfeld
to
take
padilla
into
military
custody.
the
defense
department
personnel
immediately
took
custody
of
padilla
and
detained
him
at
the
consolidated
naval
brig
in
charleston,
south
carolina,
where
he
has
been
held
ever
since.
two
days
later,
padilla’s
attorney
filed
a
section
2241
habeas
petition
on
his
behalf
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
alleging
that
padilla’s
military
detention
violates
the
constitution.
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
habeas
petition
not
withstanding
the
absence
of
both
padilla
and
his
immediate
custodian
from
the
southern
district.
on
the
merits
that
court
held
that
the
president
was
authorized,
both
by
the
constitution
and
statute
to
detain
an
enemy
combatant,
to
detain
as
enemy
combatants,
american
citizens
captured
on
american
soil
during
wartime.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court’s
jurisdictional
holding,
but
concluded
that
the
president
lack
the
authority
to
militarily
detained
padilla.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
southern
district
lack
jurisdictional
over
padilla’s
habeas
petition
under
the
habeas
statute
section
2241.
we
therefore
do
not
decide
whether
padilla’s
military
detention
is
lawful.
section
2241(a)
provides
that
district
courts
may
issue
a
habeas
relief
within
their
respective
jurisdictions.
we
hold
that
in
habeas
challenges
to
present
physical
confinement
such
as
padilla’s,
jurisdiction
is
determined
by
two
complimentary
rules,
the
immediate
custodian
rule,
and
the
district
of
confinement
rule.
under
the
immediate
custodian
rule,
the
proper
respondent
in
padilla’s
challenge
to
his
present
physical
confinement
is
his
immediate
custodian
or
the
warden
of
the
facility
in
which
padilla
is
detained.
in
this
case,
that
is
melanie
marr,
the
commander
of
the
naval
brig
in
south
carolina.
the
court
of
appeals
mistakenly
held
that
secretary
rumsfeld
is
the
proper
respondent
because
he
exercises
what
it
called
“legal
control”
over
padilla,
but
the
habeas
statute,
established
practice,
and
our
precedent
sall
make
clear
that
a
supervisory
official
exercises
legal
control
is
not
a
proper
respondent
in
challenges
to
present
physical
confinement.
under
the
district
of
confinement
rule,
a
habeas
petitioner
challenging
his
present
physical
confinement
should
file
under
district
of
his
confinement,
which
is
also
the
district
in
which
his
immediate
custodian
resides.
braden
v.
30th
judicial
district
and
strait
v.
laird,
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
mistakenly
relied,
did
not
involve
challenges
to
present
physical
confinement,
and
thus
do
not
aid
the
deal.
finally,
ex
parte
endo
is
an
opposite,
because
there
the
government
moved
the
habeas
petitioner
after,
she
properly
filed
a
habeas
petition
in
her
district
of
confinement.
padilla
did
not
file
his
habeas
petition
until
two
days
after
he
was
moved
to
south
carolina.
under
the
immediate
custodian
and
district
of
confinement
rules,
padilla
should
have
filed
his
habeas
petition
that
district
of
south
of
carolina,
not
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
at
the
entry
of
an
ordered
dismissal
without
prejudice.
justice
kennedy
has
written
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
o’connor
has
joined.
