ms.
jennifer
martinez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
even
in
wartime,
america
has
always
been
a
nation
governed
by
the
rule
of
law.
today
the
government
asks
this
court
for
a
broad
ruling
that
would
allow
the
president
unlimited
power
to
imprison
any
american
anywhere
at
any
time
without
trial
simply
by
labeling
him
an
enemy
combatant.
we
ask
this
court
for
a
narrow
ruling
that
leaves
for
another
day
the
grave
constitutional
question
of
whether
our
system
would
permit
the
indefinite
imprisonment
without
trial
of
american
citizens
on
american
soil
based
on
suspicion
that
they
have
associated
with
terrorists.
we
simply
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
at
a
minimum
congress
would
have
to
clearly
and
unequivocally
authorize
such
a
departure
from
our
nation's
traditions.
and
since
congress
has
not
done
so,
mr.
padilla
is
entitled
to
be
charged
with
a
crime
and
to
have
his
day
in
court.
the
detention
at
issue
in
this
case
is
exactly
the
type
of
detention
that
our
founding
fathers
were
concerned
about
based
on
their
experience
with
the
british
crown,
where
the
king
had
locked
up
citizens
based
on--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--yes,
your
honor,
but
there
is
no
reference
in
the
text
of
that
authorization
to
any
power
to
detain
american
citizens
on
american
soil
based
on
suspicion.
and
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
in
the
debates
that
congress
contemplated
that
it
might
be
used
in
such
a
way.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
certainly,
your
honor,
as--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--no,
but
what
is
limited
to
citizens
is
section
4001
in
which
congress
specifically
provided
that
no
citizen
shall
be
imprisoned
or
otherwise
detained
by
the
united
states
except
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
no,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
what
we
are
talking
about...
first
of
all,
there
is
a
general
presumption
against
extraterritorial
application
of
statutes.
and
so
in
the
absence
of
an
indication
that
congress
intended
4001
to
apply
overseas,
that
general
presumption
would
limit
it
to
this
country.
moreover,
the
history
of
4001--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--which
clear
statement
rule,
your
honor?
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor,
we
are
and
our
argument
is
limited
to
detentions
within
this
country--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--our
argument
is
that
what
there
needs
to
be
a
clear
statement
of
is
of
the
authority
to
detain
an
american
citizen
on
american
soil.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
given,
one,
by
the
history
of
section
4001
in
which
congress
looked
at
the
emergency
detention
act
that
had
been
passed
during
the
cold
war
which
would
have
allowed
the
president,
in
case
of
an
internal
security
emergency
or
war,
to
imprison
individuals
based
on
suspicion
that
they
were
associated
with
a
foreign
power
and
were
going
to
engage
in
acts
of
terrorism.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
certainly
the
president
would
have
inherent
authority
with
or
without
this
resolution
to
seize
an
individual
who
is
engaged
in
an
act
like
that
that
took
place
on
9/11.
but
after
that
individual
had
been
seized,
in
order
to
for
that
person
to
be
held
in
detention
in
this
country,
if
they
are
a
citizen,
in
particular,
there
must
be
some
express
statutory
authorization
that
provides
a
framework
for
that
ongoing
detention.
and
that
comes
not
only
from
4001,
but
also
from
the
due
process
clause,
and--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--our
position
is
that
4001
applies
within
the
united
states
and
its
text
means
what
it
says,
that
no,
no
person--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
congress
could
provide
for
some
alternative
legislative
scheme
for
dealing
with
such
individuals.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
at
this
time,
our
position
would
be
that
such
persons
would
have
to
be
given
an
article
iii
trial,
unless
congress
came
in
with
some
other
provision.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
agree
that
such
persons
are
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
4001
refers
only
to
citizens.
but
we
would
agree
that
aliens
within
this
country
might
certainly
be
protected
as
well.
this
case
simply
does
not
present
that
question,
but
we
would
not
disagree
with
that.
i
think
what
is
important--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--if
your
honors
believe
that
4000...
that
the
authorization
was
meant
to
specifically
authorize
the
detention
of
american
citizens
on
american
soil,
we
would
contend
first
that
there
is
no
limiting
principle
within
that
authorization
for
who
may
be
detained.
the
government
claims
that
anyone
who
is
associated
with
al
qaeda
falls
within
this
definition.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
i
think
when
you
start
trying
to
draw
those
lines
on
a
case-by-case
basis
where
this
individual
because
they
are
actually
in
the
midst
of
a
hijacking
is
close
enough
whereas
some
other
individual
who
is
merely
in
the
early
stages
of
a
plot
might
not
be
enough,
the
difficulty
of
drawing
those
lines
shows
the
need
for
clear
congressional
action
here.
this
is
primarily
a
job
for
congress
to
create,
if
there
is
a
need
in
this
country
for
preventive
detention
of
terrorists,
that's
a
legislative
job
for
our
legislature
to
undertake.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
that's
correct.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
broad
authorizations
for
use
of
force
in
wartime
have
also
not
traditionally
be
interpreted
to
allow
the
executive
unlimited
power
over
citizens.
so
in
cases
like
duncan
and
endo,
this
court
has
said
that
a
wartime
authorization
for
action
by
the
executive
should
not
be
construed
broadly,
but
should
be
construed
narrowly
to
give
only
the
power
that
it
clearly
and
unequivocally
indicates.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
what
4001
was
intended
to
prevent
was
a
claim
by
the
executive
that
his
broad
inherent
powers
in
wartime,
which
was
specifically
what
4001
addressed,
would
be
enough
to
allow
the
detention
of
american
citizens.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
our
view
would
be
that
because
of
the
difficulty
of
the
question
of
determining,
for
example,
as
i
believe
justice
kennedy
asked
earlier,
how
long
would
such
interrogation
be
necessary?
would
the
district
court
be
required
to
take
evidence
on
those
sorts
of
issues?
in
the
event
that
there
were
no
other
alternatives,
we
believe
that
would
be
appropriate,
but
we
also
believe
that's
quintessentially
a
question
for
congress,
which
could
hold
legislative
hearings.
and
after
due
deliberation,
come
to
some
conclusion
about
what
was
required
in
this
context.
and
that
is
in
fact
what
our
democratic
allies,
united
kingdom
and
israel,
have
done
in
passing
specific
legislation
about
the
preventive
detention
of
suspected
terrorists
based
on
a
legislative
finding
about
what
periods
of
time--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--your
honor--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that,
first
of
all,
were
this
court
to
rule
that
it
was...
that
congressional
action
was
required,
i
have
no
doubt
that
congress
would
step
into
the
breach
very
quickly
to
provide
whatever
authorization
the
executive
branch
deemed
necessary.
and
so
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
would
fill
that
measure.
here
in
this
particular
case,
the
government
has
already
said
that
mr.
padilla
no
longer
possesses
any
intelligence
value,
and
so
his
interrogation
is
at
an
end.
and
at
this
point,
after
two
years
in
detention,
without
any
sort
of
hearing,
without
any
access
to
counsel,
it's
more
than
appropriate
that
he
be
charged
with
a
crime
unless
congress
comes
forward
with
some
alternative
scheme.
now,
if
i
may
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
contrary
to
mr.
clement's
suggestions,
this
case
does
primarily
involve
issues
of
venue
and
not
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
never
held
that
there
is
a
hard
and
fast
rule
requiring
an
immediate
custodian,
and
this
court
has
also
not
applied
rigid
territorial
requirements
about
the
location
of
a
suit.
and
in
particular,
in
the
strait
case,
this
court
made
clear
that
the
type
of
jurisdiction
that
was
necessary
was
jurisdiction
making
the
respondent
amenable
to
service
of
process
under
the
long
arm
provisions
by
citing
international
shoe
and
mcgee,
which
are
provisions
applying
normal
rules
of
personal
jurisdiction.
given
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
extensive
personal
involvement
of
secretary
rumsfeld
in
this
matter,
makes
him
an
appropriate
respondent
and
new
york
is
an
appropriate
venue
for
this
suit.
the
government
brought
mr.
padilla
to
new
york.
they
placed
him
in
court
proceedings
there.
counsel
was
appointed
and
litigation
had
begun.
it
was
the
government's
choice
to
remove
him
from
that
forum,
but
that
does
not
change
the
fundamental
fact
that
jurisdiction
was
proper
in
new
york.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
i
think
there
is
no
hard
and
fast
general
rule
as
the
government
states
it.
there
are
numerous
exceptions
already
to
the
rule
that
the
government
articulates
that
can
be
found
in
prior
cases.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
this
court
might
very
well
decide
to
make
such
a
venue
rule,
but
i
would
note
that
the
government
at
this
point
in
the
case
has
waived
their
objection
to
venue
by
not
pursuing
it
on
appeal.
they
challenged
venue
in
the
district
court,
and
they
did
not
appeal
that.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor.
they
have
the
challenged
the
proper
custodian,
but
as
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
like
endo,
like
eisentrager
make
clear,
that
the
identity
of
the
proper
respondent
is
not
a
hard
and
fast
or
absolute
jurisdictional
rule.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
would
argue
that
jurisdiction
was
proper
in
new
york
in
this
case
because--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
strait,
there
was
personal
jurisdiction
over
secretary
rumsfeld
in
new
york
because
of
his
contacts
with
that
forum.
returning
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
what
i
think
is
important
for
this
court
to
realize
is
that
the
war
on
terror
presents
many
difficult
questions
about
the
proper
balance
between
civil
liberties
and
national
security.
congress
is
the
body
of
our
government
that
has
been...
that
was
entrusted
by
the
founders
for
making
law
to
deal
with
new
situations.
and
congress
is
fully
capable
of
considering
the
various
parameters
of
any
sort
of
scheme
of
detention
that
might
be
necessary.
and
certainly
this
court
would
have
the
power
to
review,
to
determine
whether
that
system
established
by
congress
were
constitutional,
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
claim
by
the
executive
to
a
virtually
unlimited
system,
where
any
person
that
the
president
deems
an
enemy
combatant--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--well,
he
claims
them
both
on
the
basis
of
inherent
executive
power
and
on
the
basis
of
the
authorization.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
simply
no
indication
that
when
congress
passed
the
authorization
for
use
of
military
force
which
enabled
us
to
deploy
our
troops
overseas,
the
congress
also
thought
that
they
were
authorizing
the
indefinite
military
detention
without
trial
of
american
citizens
on
american
soil.
there
was
no
debate
of
such
a
dramatic
departure
from
our
constitutional
traditions.
and
just
a
few
weeks
later
when
congress
passed
the
patriot
act,
it
extensively
debated
a
provision
that
allowed
the
detention
of
aliens
for
seven
days.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
we
would
say
it
does
not
apply
off
the
battlefield,
certainly
to
u.s.
citizens
on
u.s.
soil.
and
this
court--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--this
court
need
not
decide
that
in
this
case,
and
i
certainly
don't--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--i
would
agree
that
it
does
not...
the
authorization
does
not
clearly
indicate
that
it's
applicable
to
aliens
either.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
our
point,
which
is
that
the
degree
of
specificity
that
would
need
to
be
required
to
authorize
this
kind
of
extraordinary
detention
of
citizens
would
be
greater,
and
in
particular
with
aliens,
there
has
always
been
a
greater
power
of
the
executive
because
they
have
no
right
to
be
here.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
no,
your
honor.
as
to
individuals
within
the
united
states,
if
4001
is
not
at
issue
because
of
its
specific
reference
to
citizens,
we
would
say
aliens
within
the
united
states
would
have
the
same,
would
be
in
exactly
the
same
position.
correct.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
correct,
your
honor,
were
it
not
for
4001.
but
we
think
4001
calls
for
not
just
for
broad
authorization
of
executive
power,
but
specific
authorization,
because
4001
was
concerned
with
the
situation
where
there
was
a
general
declaration
of
war,
or
where
there
was
some
type
of
internal
emergency.
and
the
concern
was
that
the
executive
should
not
be
able
to
rely
on
that
general
declaration
of
war
or
that
general
situation
to
lock
up
citizens.
that
was
precisely
the
situation
with
the
japanese
internment
camps,
the
president...
president
roosevelt
having
authorized
the
broadest
possible
force
you
can
have
to
fight
a
war.
there
was
a
declaration
of
complete
war
against
germany
and
japan.
congress
looked
back
on
that
and
did
not
want
a
future
president
to
be
able
to
find
in
such
a
declaration
of
war
the
power
to
imprison
american
citizens.
they
wanted
it
to
come
from
specific
legislation.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
your
honor,
certainly
as
to
an
overseas
battlefield,
4001,
because
of
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality,
would
not
apply.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
4001
would
apply
upon
his
return.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
correct.
and
let
me
say
also,
in
respect
to
the
japanese
internment
camps,
congress
was
very
specific
in
passing
4001
that
what
it
wanted
was
democratic
deliberation
by
our
lawmakers
about
the
necessity
of
this
kind
of
extreme
measure,
where
american
citizens
might
be
detained
without
trial.
it
didn't
want
that
to
slip
under
the
radar,
under
the
umbrella
of
a
general
declaration
of
war
or
general
use
of
force.
it
wanted
to
ensure
that
there
was
specific
debate
by
congress
on
those
very
different
constitutional
questions
presented
in
those
situations
by
the
power
of
detaining
citizens.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
your
honor,
there
certainly
are
many
other
systems
that
provide
for
that
sort
of
judicial
review.
in
the
united
kingdom
and
israel,
for
example,
people
detained
under
preventive
detention
schemes
are
entitled
to
access
to
counsel,
they
are
entitled
to
prompt
and
periodic
judicial
review
under
legislative
standards
to
determine
whether
those
detentions
can
be
continued.
and
certainly
there
are
many
comparative
examples
out
there
where
legislatures
have
made
those
kind
of
fact-findings
about
what's
appropriate.
and
there
is
no
reason
why
our
legislature
could
not
undertake
such--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
absolutely
correct.
you
could
certainly
read
the
necessary
and
appropriate
language
that
way.
and
let
me
also
make
clear
that
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
president
would
have
no
power
either
under
the
aumf
or
under
his
inherent
powers
to
seize
an
individual
in
the
case
of
imminent
violent
activity.
we
are
simply
talking
about
his
power
to
continue
to
detain
that
individual
over
many
months
prior
to
that
initial
seizure.
and
so
regardless
of
how
you
read
the
aumf,
that's
simply
not
what
they're
arguing
about.
we're
arguing
about,
once
the
individual
has
been
prevented
from
carrying
out
the
harmful
attack,
and
once
they're
in
government
custody,
can
they
simply
be
held
forever
without
trial
until
the
end
of
the
war
on
terror,
or
instead,
once
they're
taken
into
custody,
must
they
be
treated
in
accordance
with
our
positive
laws.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor,
particularly--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--if
there
were
a
situation
where
an
individual,
not
like
my
client,
but
an
individual
that
were
on
the
verge
of
engaging
in
imminent
violent
conduct,
certainly
the
president
would
have
the
power,
even
under
the
fourth
amendment,
to
seize
that
individual
without
a
warrant
and
bring
him
into
custody
on
the
basis
that
they
were
about
to
engage
in
a
violent
act.
but
that's
a
far
different
situation
from
seizing
someone
like
my
client
who
is
not
alleged
to
be
on
the
verge
of
imminent
lawless
activity,
was
not
in
the
process
of
hijacking
an
aircraft
but
was
simply
alleged
to
be
part
of
a
plot--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--for
the
initial
seizure,
we
would
say
probable
cause.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
we
would
submit
no,
but
it's
possible
that
when
that
question
came
up,
the
quantum
of
evidence
might
be
weighed
against
the
danger
that
the
executive
perceived.
if
the
executive
had
some
amount
of
suspicion
that
there
was
about
to
be
a
very
violent
activity,
it
could
be
possible
that
some
lesser
amount
might
be
required
for
the
initial
seizure.
but
we're
not
talking--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--yes,
your
honor.
but
we're
not
talking
about
that
question
of
initial
seizure
here.
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
the
ongoing
detention
for
two
years
of
someone
after
there
has
been--
ms.
jennifer
martinez
--yes.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
say
at
48
hours
under
this
court's
decisions.
if
congress
thinks
that
a
longer
period
of
time
is
appropriate
in
terrorism
cases,
it
can
do
as
other
countries
have
done
and
provide
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
in
the
united
kingdom,
there
is
a
48
hours
plus
a
maximum
of
7
days
without
charge
for
suspected
terrorists.
in
the
united
kingdom,
up
to
14
days.
congress
might
come
in
and
provide
some
legislative
extension.
but
in
the
absence
of
that,
a
normal
rule
of
48
hours
under
county
of
riverside
would
be
appropriate.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor.
and
let
me
say
that
those
are
exactly
the
sort
of
individuals
that
the
passage
of
4001
was
designed
to
address.
the
emergency
detention
act,
which
4001
repealed,
specifically
talked
about
the
possibility
of
saboteurs
in
this
country
who
are
under
the
direction
and
control
of
the
communist
empire.
and
so
there
was
a
specific
concern
with
individuals
who
might
be
under
that
kind
of
power
in
4001.
and
congress
wanted
to
make
very
clear
that
such
individuals
could
not
simply
be
detained
at
executive
discretion,
but
could
only
be
detained
pursuant
to
positive
law.
positive
law
that
is
simply
nonexistent
in
this
case.
the
type
of
association
with
a
terrorist
organization
is
also
unclear
based
on
the
government's
allegations
in
this
case.
surely
the
government
cannot
claim
that
anyone
who
associated
with
any
member
of
al
qaeda
at
any
time
would
be
subject
to
indefinite
military
detention
without
trial.
mr.
padilla's
mother,
because
she
is
associated
with
her
son,
may
be
argued
to
have
associated
with
al
qaeda,
and
clearly
that's
not
what
congress
had
in
mind,
to
allow
that
person
to
be
locked
up
with
no
right
to
a
lawyer,
no
right
to
a
hearing
for
as
long
as
the
war
on
terror
lasts.
that's
simply
not
consistent
with
our
nation's
constitutional
traditions,
it's
a
limitless
power
and
there
is
no
call
for
it
in
this
case.
ms.
jennifer
martinez
yes,
your
honor.
we
do
not
believe
that
judge
mukasey's
solution
was
adequate.
we
believe
that
in
the
first
sentence,
clear
authorization
and
parameters
for
such
detention
must
come
from
congress,
defining
who
ought
to
be
detained
and
what
procedures
ought
to
accompany
those
detentions.
and
at
that
point,
this
court
could
review
them
for
consistency
with
the
constitution.
but
no,
while
certainly
judge
mukasey's
order
was
better
than
what
the
government
offered,
which
was
no
process
at
all,
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
no
access
to
counsel,
certainly
judge
mukasey's
order
was
better
than
that.
but
when
the
indefinite
deprivation
of
a
citizen's
liberty
is
at
stake,
we
would
argue
that
the
government
must
come
forward
with
more
than
some
evidence
consisting
of
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
might
support
the
government's
position
that
he's
associated
with
terrorists.
when
this
type
of
extreme
deprivation
of
liberty
is
at
issue,
something
more
than
that
is
required
by
the
due
process
clause
and
by
our
constitution.
so
certainly
what
we
would
say
is
that
this
court
needs
not
to
decide
those
issues
today,
of
what
precise
standard
of
proof
ought
to
be
given,
exactly
when
an
individual
ought
to
be
allowed
access
to
counsel
and
what
the
limits
are
on
how
long
such
an
individual
could
be
held,
et
cetera,
because
those
are
primarily
questions
for
congress.
and
this
court
ought
to
wait
until
congress
has
come
in
and
provided
that
kind
of
guidance
before
it
passes
on
these
grave
constitutional
questions,
which
really
go
to
the
core
of
what
our
democracy
is
about,
which
is
that
the
government
cannot
take
citizens
in
this
country
off
the
street
and
lock
them
up
in
jail
forever
without
a
trial.
that's
never
the
way
our
country
has
operated
and
it's
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
our
traditions.
and
so
i
would
submit
today
is
not
the
day
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
that's
permissible.
the
government
asks
in
this
case
for
basically
limitless
power
and
however
grave
the
circumstances
of
the
war
on
terror
may
be,
this
nation
has
faced
other
grave
threats.
we've
had
war
on
our
soil
before
and
never
before
in
our
nation's
history
has
this
court
granted
the
president
a
blank
check
to
do
whatever
he
wants
to
american
citizens.
so
the
fact
that
we're
at
war
does
not
mean
that
our
normal
constitutional
rules
do
not
apply.
even
in
wartime,
especially
in
wartime,
the
founders
wanted
to
place
limits
on
the
ability
of
the
executive
to
deprive
citizens
of
liberty.
and
they
were
concerned,
based
on
the
history
of
the
british
crown,
of
the
possibility
that
an
unchecked
executive
using
excuses
based
on
national
security,
using
the
military
power
to
render
that
superior
to
civilian
authorities,
could
exercise
the
exact
type
of
power
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
