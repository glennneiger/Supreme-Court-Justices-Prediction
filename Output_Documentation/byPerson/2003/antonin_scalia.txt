justice
scalia
with
your
permission.
justice
scalia
even...
even
assuming
that's
true,
i...
i
thought
a
right
is
a
right.
i...
i
thought
we
have
a
right
to
something.
it
doesn't
mean
somebody
can
turn
it
down.
justice
scalia
and
riparian
rights
include
the
right
to
take
the
water.
that's
clear.
justice
scalia
and
that's
the
right
to
take
water,
not...
not
the
right
to
come
and
beg
maryland
to
take
water.
justice
scalia
but
the
compact
reserves
to
the
state
of
virginia
and
its
citizens
riparian
rights.
if
riparian
rights
include,
as
i
think
they
do,
the
right
to
take
water,
it
seems
to
me
that
aspect
of
the
case
is...
is
quite
easy
to
decide.
justice
scalia
what
authority
did
you
have
to
minimize
the
impact?
the
compact
between
the
states
gives
the
state
and
its
citizens
riparian
rights,
including
the
right
to
build
structures
into
the
river
so
long
as
they
do
not
impede
navigation.
was
maryland's
objection
that...
that
this
new
structure
would
impede
navigation
of
the
river?
it's
a...
it's
above
the
navigable
portion
anyway,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
so.
so
what
was
your
objection?
justice
scalia
it
was
ugly?
justice
scalia
well,
you
should
have
reserved
that
right
in
the...
in
the
compact.
the
compact
could
have
said,
you
know,
provided
it
does
not
impede
navigation
or
be
ugly.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
but
it
says--
--why?
but
it
is
a
right
of
use,
and
that's
what
you're...
and
that's
what
you're
contradicting
here.
that's
all
they
want.
they're
not
trying
to
govern
the
river.
they
just
want
to
use
it.
justice
scalia
mr.
baida,
maybe
i'm
missing
something
here,
but
i
did
not
understand
that
the
state
of
virginia
is
contesting
the
ownership
of
maryland
of
the
bed
of
the
river.
is...
is
that...
is
that
contested
by
virginia?
i
thought
that
they
concede
that
the
river
right
up
to
the
low-water
mark
on
the
southern
shore
of
the
virginia
shore
belongs
to
maryland.
but
that...
but
that
does
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
riparian
rights
given
to
the
citizens
of
virginia
and
to
the
state
of
virginia
requires
that...
that
they
obtain
permission
from
maryland
before
withdrawing
water
or
creating
a
structure
to
withdraw
water.
justice
scalia
may
i
ask
just
one
quick
question
before
you
sit
down?
i
just
think
it's
not--
--does...
does
maryland
require
virginia's
citizens
to
have
a
maryland
fishing
license
to
fish
in
the
potomac?
justice
scalia
it
just
says
that
they
have
rights
to
fish,
but
just
as
you
argue
that
riparian
rights
and
rights
to
take
water
can,
nonetheless,
require
prior
permission,
you
could
also
take
the...
you
ought
to
also
take
the
position
that
the
right
to
fish
requires
prior
permission.
so
you
ought
to
get
a
maryland
fish...
i'm
darned
if
i'm
going
to
get
a
maryland
fishing
right...
fishing
license--
--do
you
want
to
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time,
mr.
baida?
justice
scalia
why...
why
is
it
concurrent
for
fishing?
article
seventh
says
that
the...
that
the
citizens
of
both
states...
the
right
of
fishing
in
the
river
shall
be
common
to
and
equally
enjoyed
by
the
citizens
of
both
states.
justice
scalia
for
the
preservation
of
fish
or
for
the
performance...
for
preserving
and
keeping
open
the
channel?
justice
scalia
has...
has
virginia
issued...
is
a
virginia
fishing
license
valid
in
the...
in
the
potomac?
justice
scalia
well,
virginia
would
have
the
same
claim
against
maryland
if
maryland
took
out
too
much
water.
justice
scalia
you
see,
i
can
understand
the
authority
for
maryland
to
permit
it
since
maryland
owns
the
river
bed.
what...
what
is
the
authority
for
virginia
to
demand
a
permit
from
its
riparian
owners?
justice
scalia
because
of
its
state
riparian
sovereignty
over...
because
of
its
state
sovereignty
over
the
bank.
justice
scalia
does
maryland
or
virginia
tax
the...
the
value
of
a...
of
a
major
pier
that
goes
out
into
the
river?
i
mean,
it's
worth
something,
and
i
assume
there's
a
tax
on
it.
anything
that's
worth
anything
is
taxed.
justice
scalia
strictly
speaking--
--no,
it
doesn't
say
as
a
sovereign.
it...
it
says
virginia.
it
does
not
say
as
a
sovereign.
this
is
very
important.
justice
scalia
i'm
right.
justice
scalia
of
course,
it
does
not
use
the
word.
justice
scalia
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
article
fourth
acknowledges
that
virginia
is
what
you
might
call
a
riparian
sovereign.
it
has
sovereign
rights
over...
over
the
bank
of
the
river.
it
says
is
entitled
not
only
to
full
dominion
over
the
soil
to
low-water
mark,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
but
such
use
of
the
river
beyond
the
line
of
low...
as
may
be
necessary
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
her
riparian
ownership.
