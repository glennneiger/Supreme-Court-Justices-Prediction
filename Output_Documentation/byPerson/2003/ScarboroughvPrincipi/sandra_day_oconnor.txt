mr.
wolfman,
i...
i
don't
understand
why
we
have
to
first
address
equitable
tolling.
i
mean,
why
don't
we
look
at
the
statute
and
see
whether
it
is
necessary
that
this
allegation
that
the
u.s.
was
not
substantially
justified
has
to
be
made
within
30
days?
i
mean,
if
it
doesn't,
why
do
you
get
into
equitable
tolling
at
all?
why
don't
you
start
with
what
the
statute
requires?
i
thought
that
was
what
the
split
was
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take...
do
you
take
the
position
that
under
the
statute,
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
statute,
subsection
(b),
that
that
allegation
does
not
have
to
be
made
within
the
30-day
period?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
plan
to
address
it
this
morning
with
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
just
looks
like
a
lot
easier
argument
to
me
than
equitable
tolling.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
similar
to
the
kind
of
interpretation
the
court
had
to
face
in
edelman,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
you
know--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
point.
the
statute
places
the
burden
on
the
government
to
prove
that
its
position
was
not
substantially
justified.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's...
that's
true.
the
question
is
whether
this
allegation
has
to
be
made
within
the
30
days
or
whether
it
can
be
offered
subsequently
as
an
amendment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
clearly
it
has
to
be
made.
and
the
government
certainly
was
not
in
doubt
about
the
fact
that
its...
it
wasn't
going
to
be
liable
for
the
fees
unless
it
was
in
due
course
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
said
you'd
give
us
some
reasons
why
this
is
important
to
the
government.
