justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
we're
talking
about
here.
whether...
whether
the...
whether
the
client
can
resist
the
lawyer's
request
for
the
20
percent
contingent
fee
on
the
ground
that
it's
the
lawyer's
own
fault
that
i
didn't
get
compensation
that
would
enable
me
to
pay
that
fee.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
if
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
edelman,
it
wasn't
in
the...
it
didn't
follow
immediately
as
part
of
the
same
paragraph
and
the...
the
what
leaps
to
mind
when
you
read
a
sentence
that
says
the
parties
shall
also
allege,
is
where?
where
shall
the
party
allege
this?
is
he
supposed
to
file
a
separate
paper
later?
the
logical
answer
to
that
question
is
found
in
the
preceding
sentence:
shall
within
30
days
submit
to
the
court
an
application
which
shows
that
the
party
is
a
prevailing
party
and
is
eligible
to
receive
an
award
stating
the
actual
time,
blah,
blah.
the
party
shall
also
allege.
surely
it
means
where?
in
that
application
that
is
referred
to
in
the
preceding
sentence.
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
a...
a...
just
a
mess
of...
of
that
paragraph
to
say,
you
know,
you
can
file
a
paper,
who
knows,
9
months
later
alleging
that.
that...
that's
just
not
a...
that's
not
a
reasonable
reading
of
it,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
matter
at
all
when
it's
alleged?
you
can
wait
until,
you
know,
the
very
end
of
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
has
to
go
along
not
even
knowing
whether
you
claim
that
the
government's
position
was
substantially
justified?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
burden
of
proof
as
opposed
to
the
burden
of
making
the
allegation
of...
of
setting
the...
the
point
in
controversy.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
even
if
you
don't
allege
it,
the
government
has
to
come
in
and
show
that
its
position
was...
even
though
it's
never
alleged.
surely
you
don't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
if
you
have
a
lawyer
that
hasn't
read
the
statute
and
he
doesn't
realize,
that
he
thinks
if
he
won
the
case,
he
gets
his
fees?
and
so
he
just
files
this
without
any
allegation
that
the
government's
case
was
not
substantially
justified.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
still
has
to
come
in
and
prove
that
its
case
was
substantially
justified?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
be
the
logical
point--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
that...
for
that
claim
to
be
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
well,
there's...
there's
more
than
that
to
it.
this...
this
is
always
filed
by
an
attorney,
and
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
assume
that
he
cannot
just
come
in
and
say
the
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified
when
it
is
very
clear
that
it
was
substantially
justified.
i
assume
he'd
be...
he'd
be
liable
for
a
sanction
from
the
court
if
he
did
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
to
follow
up,
i
mean,
what...
what
this
means
is
we...
we
want
to
be
sure,
when
this
thing
is
filed,
that
it's
not
just
nuisance
stuff.
we
want
a
lawyer,
when
the
thing
is
filed
within
the
30
days,
to
be
standing
on
his
reputation
as
an
officer
of
the
court
that,
in
fact,
the
government's
position
wasn't
substantial.
justice
antonin
scalia
we...
we
may
not
be
as
tender
to
attorneys
who
should
know
better
as
we
are
to...
to
litigants
who
maybe
had
a
bad
attorney
or
didn't
know
better
themselves.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
nobody
says
that
this
is
an
allegation
regarding
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what...
what
the
issue
is
is
whether
the
30-day
limit
is
a
jurisdictional
limit
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
think
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i...
explain
this
relation-back
theory.
anything
can
relate
back?
you
can
do
any...
is
there
no
limit
to
the...
to
the
sweep
of
that
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
had
a
statute
that...
that
provided
a...
i
don't
know...
3-year
statute
of
limitations
for...
for
negligence
in
a
particular
context,
but
it...
it
went
on
to
say,
however,
all
causes
of
action
claiming
intentional
wrong
must
be
filed
within
1
year.
do
you
think
that
after
2-and-a-half
years
you
could
revise
a
filing
that
did
not
allege
intentional
wrong
and
say
it
relates
back?
and...
and
some
states
do
have
different
statutes
for
intentional
torts
versus
negligent
torts.
do
you
think
you
could
revise
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
really
does
come
down
to
whether
this...
this
allegation
was...
whether
there
was
some
particular
reason
why
it
had
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--sure,
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
said...
who
said
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
what
is
it?
i
mean,
just...
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
also
some...
some
other
statutes
besides
eaja
in
which
the
government,
when
it
loses,
whether
its
position
was
substantially
justified
or
not,
is
subject
to...
to
fees.
isn't
that...
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
do
that,
could
you
finish
your
answer
before
where
you
said
you
had
two
points
and
you
raised
a
case
with
regard
to
point
one,
and
then
i
never
did
hear
point
two
because
a
question
came
up.
you
don't
remember
it
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
forget
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
want
to
generalize
from
fela
cases,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
minear,
is
it...
could
we
possibly
find
for
you
in
this
case
on
the...
on
the
issue
of
relation-back
while
leaving
open
the
question
of
whether
equitable
tolling
can
apply
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
as
i
understand
the
relation-back
doctrine,
it
doesn't
matter
about
the
equities.
whether...
whether
it's
his
fault
or
not,
you
can
always
relate
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas,
equitable
tolling
would
generally
be...
be
eliminated
if...
if
fault
is
involved.
