mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
2412(d)
requires
that
eaja
fee
applicants
submit
an
application
within
30
days
of
a
final
judgment
that
includes
an
allegation
that
the
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified.
petitioner's
lawyer
failed
to
do
so
in
this
case
and
for
that
reason
fails
to
qualify
for
fees.
this
court
has
no
power
to
amend
eaja
or
to
excuse
lawyers
from
their
carelessness
in
failing
to
follow
its
requirements.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
under
section
2412(b),
eaja
subjects
the
united
states
to
fees
on
the
same
basis
as
other
parties
in
other
legislation.
by
contrast,
section
2412(d)
provides
a
special
provision,
distinct
from
those
provisions
that
apply
to
private
parties
and
the
united
states
generally,
that
requires
there
be
a
showing
that
the
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
if
i
can
clarify.
section
2412(b)
indicates
the
government
is
waiving
its
sovereign
immunity
as
to
those
other
statutes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
so
in
the
case
of
2412(b),
it
puts
the
united
states
on
the
same
par
as
private
parties,
and
in
that
sense,
it's
comparable
to
the
situation
that
was
faced
in
irwin
where
the
united
states
is
subject
to
title
vii
actions
on
the
same
basis
as
private
parties.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
justice
kennedy,
i
have
two
answers
for
that.
first
of
all,
the
statute
requires
that
these
conditions
be
met,
and
these
are
conditions
on
the
government's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
these
are
conditions
on
the
government's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
so
the
government
has
an
obligation
to
insist
that
parties
comply
with
those
conditions--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i'd
like
to
make
two
points
with
regard
to
this.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
30-day
time
limit--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--this
court
indicated
in
ins
v.
jean,
496
u.s.
at
160,
that
the
30-day
requirement
does
apply
to
the
allegation
of
no
substantial
justification.
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
jean
indicates
it's
a
30-day
requirement
and
at
page
160
they
say
that
the
fee
application
has
to
include--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--this
allegation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
government...
the
government
attorney
might
have
that
obligation
in
the
course
of
settlement
negotiations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
in
adversary
litigation,
the
united
states
certainly
doesn't
have
the
obligation--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that's...
and
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
in
the
course
of
discussing
these
matters,
there's
a
possibility
that
there
could...
that
the
government
has
to
be
careful
not
to
mislead
the
party,
and
so
that's
where
an
ethical
obligation
could
come
forward.
but
in
this
case,
there
were
no
negotiations
of
that
type.
rather,
there's
simply
the
government's
obligation
to
respond
to
the
fee
application,
and
we
responded
appropriately.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
the
united
states
was
not
on
notice
whether
this
party
was
contesting
that
the
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--there
are
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
it's
a
condition
that
congress
placed
on
sovereign
immunity.
and
by
that
alone,
the
courts
and
lawyers
and
the
united
states
representing
congress'
will
must
respect
it.
second,
this
obligation
requires
the
party,
as
was
articulated
earlier,
to
examine
the
government's
position
and
make
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
they
wish
to
contest
whether
it
is
substantially
justified
or
not.
so
that
does
put
that
additional
obligation
on
counsel.
third,
it's
of
use
to
the
united
states
in
determining
how
to
respond
to
a
fee
application.
the
united
states--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--except
that
the
party
did
not
comply
with
the
condition
that
congress
imposed
on
its
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
government
and
the
courts
are
both
prejudiced
by
this
because
it
requires
two
additional
filings
that
otherwise
would
not
need
to
be
made
if
the
lawyer
had
not
been
careless.
in
this
situation...
we
face
thousands
of
suits
that
potentially
implicate
eaja
claims,
and
congress
recognized
that
these
are
matters
that
need
to
be
resolved
quickly
with
minimal
litigation
in
contradistinction
to
what's
happened
in
this
case.
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
those
issues
are
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
the
united
states
does
have
a
different
view
on
that.
but
i
must
disagree
that
is
a
pro
forma
allegation.
that...
that
suggests
that...
that
we
need
not
require
the
lawyers
to
comply
with
the
letter
of
the
law
because
we
don't
think
they're
going
to
comply
with
the
spirit
of
the
law.
rather--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
and
in
that
respect,
the
parties
have...
petitioner
has...
the
petitioner
has
made
two
arguments.
one
is
the
relation-back
doctrine
and
the
other
is
equitable
tolling.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
each
of
those
issue
specifically.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this...
probably...
i'm
not
sure
if
it
was--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--on...
on
the
relation-back
doctrine.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
the
reasons
were,
first
of
all,
our
obligation
to
defend
those
conditions
that
congress
places
on
its
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
second,
to
ensure
that
there
is
efficient
processing
of
attorney
application
fees.
justice
breyer
made
allusion
to
this
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument,
and
as
i
said
before,
the
government
faces
thousands
of
these
requests,
and
it's
very
important
they
be...
be
resolved
promptly.
and
they
can
only
be
resolved
promptly
if
parties
follow
the
rules
that
congress
has
laid
down.
we
believe
that's
why
congress
set
these
rules,
because
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
attorney
claims
would
be
resolved
efficiently,
and
they
cannot
be
resolved
efficiently
if
parties
don't
play
by
the
rules.
now,
the
relation-back
doctrine
is
really
an
exception
to
the
rules
that
congress
set
forward,
at
least
the...
the
relation-back
doctrine,
as
the...
as
petitioners
are
suggesting
it
ought
to
be
applied
here.
as
a
general
matter,
the
relation-back
doctrine
is
a
principle
that's
codified
in
rules,
such
as
rule
15
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
it
provides
an
exception
for,
in
that
case,
pleadings
being
amended
after
the
fact.
but
this
isn't
a
case
of
initiating
civil
litigation
and
this
is
not
a
case
where
rule
15
applies.
rather,
the
question
is
what
did
congress
intend.
if
congress
had
wanted
a
relation-back
doctrine,
it
could
have
specified
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
examples
that
petitioner
points
to
are
cases
involving
the
federal
employees
liability
act
involving
the
injuries
to
interstate...
to
railmen
who
are
working
in
interstate
commerce.
and
in
several
instances,
the
court
had
applied
that
as
a
common
law
principle
indicating,
as
in
kinney,
that
those
arguments
on
either
side
for
that
particular
rule.
but
i
don't
think
we
can
say
that
there's
a
general
principle
of
relation-back.
and
certainly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
i
would
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
the
note
in
rule
15(c),
the
1937
note
to
the
federal
rules
talks
about
codifications
of
this,
but
we're
talking
here
about
a
situation
where
congress
has
set
a
time
limit
and
has
not
provided
for
relation-back,
a
case
where
we're
dealing
with
sovereign
immunity,
where
this
is
a
charge
against
the
federal
fisc.
and
so
we
have--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
there
were
two
premature
applications
that
were
filed.
the
first
application
was
filed
prematurely.
the
court
returned
it
and
said
until
the
60-day
period
runs.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
parties
then
filed
another
premature
application.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right.
and
the
court
held
it
until
the
mandate
issued
and
at
that
point
asked
the
united
states
to
file
a
response,
a
30-day
response.
so
the
government
acted
quite
appropriately.
it
acted--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
it
did,
but
it
could
well
be
because
we
are
dealing
with--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
not
at
all.
at
the
time
we
filed
our
extension,
the
time
had
already
run
for
that.
but
the...
the
problem
that
we
face
in
the
government
is
that
we
have
numerous
cases
and
numerous
fee
applications.
it
could
very
well
be--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
in
this
case
the
equitable
tolling
argument,
i
have
to
point
out,
was
not
raised
before
the
court--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
we
would
say
neither
is
subject
to
equitable
exceptions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
first
of
all,
the
statute
itself
sets
a
strict
30-day
time
limit.
it
does
not
provide
for
relation-back.
if
congress
wanted
relation-back,
it
could
have.
and
to
imply
a
relation-back
doctrine
is
to
negate
congress'
specific
intent
in
this
case.
with
regard
to
equitable
tolling,
this
court
said
in
irwin
that
equitable
tolling
will
be
presumed
to
apply
in
those
cases
involving
government
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
where
the
government
is
held
liable
on
the
same
basis
as
private
parties
as
in
title
vii.
but
as
my
colloquy
with
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
united
states
is
being
held
liable
for
attorneys
fees
on
the
same
basis
as
other
parties.
that's
what
section
2412(b)
applies...
provides,
and
perhaps
equitable
tolling
should
apply
there,
perhaps
not.
that's
a
different
question.
here--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
he
would
not.
under
our
reading,
this
is
a
30-day
time
limit
and
the
parties
have
to
comply.
after
all,
this
litigation,
as
in
this
case,
has
been
going
on
for
several
years.
the
attorneys
have
an
obligation,
if
they
want
fees,
if
they
want
the
government
to
pay
their
fees,
to
keep
good
records
and
to
avoid
careless
acts--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
our
principal
basis--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--for
distinguishing
irwin.
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
also
that
equitable
tolling
was
not
raised
in
the
court--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
you
can.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
now...
now,
we
think
that
you
do
not
need
to
reach
the
equitable
tolling
issue,
but
if
you
do,
there's
no
basis
for
equitable
tolling
in
this
case
in
any
event
because
equitable
tolling
is
a
doctrine
that
developed
with
the...
based
on
the
concept
of
ameliorating
or
preventing
unfairness
to
litigants.
now,
there's
nothing
unfair
in
requiring
an
attorney
to
comply
with
congress'--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
i
could
clarify.
in
answering
justice
scalia's
question,
i
was
indicating
that
there
doesn't
have
to
be
inequitable
conduct
in
order
to
qualify
for
relation-back.
but
it
doesn't
mean
you
would
get
it
automatically.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
but
again,
rule
15(c)
by
its
terms
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
it
applies
to
pleadings.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
because
rule
15(c)
applies
to
litigation
generally.
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
a
specific
time
requirement
that
only
applies
to
government
applications...
to
applications
for
fees
against
the
government
when
the
government's
position
is
not
substantially
justified.
there's
simply
no
basis
for
applying
rule
15(c)
to
this
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
that...
that
may
be
correct.
ultimately
15(c)
simply
doesn't
apply
here
is
my
point,
and
if
we're
going
to
look
at
the
time
limits,
we
have
to
look
to
what
did
congress
intend
what
it...
when
it
enacted
2412(d)(1)(b).
it
set
a
30-day
time
limit.
it
didn't
create
any
exceptions.
it
didn't
provide
for
any
relation-back.
and
imputing
relation-back
would
destroy
that
30-day
time
limit
that
congress
specified.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
this
is
as...
as
you
point
out,
this
is
a
content
limitation.
it's
like
torres
and
other
cases
where
content
does
need
to
be
included
within
the
specified
time
limit.
it's
not
simply
a
formality
like
a
verification
or
a
signature.
rather,
we're
talking
about
the
threshold
allegation
that
triggers
the
right
for
attorneys
fees
and
triggers
the
obligation
of
the
government
to
respond
and
show
that
its
position
was
substantially
justified.
without
that,
you
really
don't
have
a
fee
application
as
congress
conceived
of
it.
when
we
look
at
what
do
we
mean
by
a
fee
application,
we
have
to
look
at
2412(d)(1)(b),
and
congress
indicated
what
it
felt
was
essential
in
the
fee
application.
you
have
to
show
that
you
prevailed.
you
have
to
show
that
you're
a
qualifying
party
under
eaja.
you
have
to
provide
your
costs,
including
an
itemized
list
of
costs,
and
you
have
to
make
the
threshold
allegation
the
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified.
those
terms
define
what
a
fee
application
is.
and
this
court's
decision
in
jean
indicates
it
all
has
to
be
done
in
that
30-day
period.
now,
to
apply
any
sort
of
relation-back
doctrine
simply
negates
the
very
careful,
strict
rules
that
congress
imposed
on
this
charge
against
the
treasury.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
in
many
cases
the
government
will
settle
it
because
the
costs
of
litigating
aren't
worth
fighting
over
the
matter.
but
in
terms
of
statistics,
i
was
able
to
find
this
in
a...
a
quick
review.
and...
and
this
outside
the
record,
so
i
am
stepping
outside
the
record
and
looking
at
government
files.
but
in
the
case
of
the
social
security
administration,
between
august
2001
and
august
2002,
the
government
paid
5,500,
roughly,
eaja
applications
in
a
total
amount
of
$18
million.
now,
social
security
is
only
one
small
part.
i
shouldn't
say
small,
but
it's
a
significant
part
of
the
eaja...
qualifying
eaja
cases.
but
as
that
indicates
there,
at
least
in
5,000
cases
the
government
made
a
payment
either
by
settlement
or
on
the
basis
of
a...
of
a--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
i
do
not
have
an
indication
of
the
total
number
of
cases
that
are
available.
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
we
face
thousands
of
these
cases,
and
efficiency
is
paramount
unless
fee
litigation
is
going
to
become
a
second
major
litigation,
which
is
something--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
it's
satellite
litigation
like
this:
over
whether
or
not
relation-back
should
apply,
under
what
situations
it
should
apply,
should
equitable
tolling
apply,
have
the
conditions
for
equitable
tolling
been
met,
all
of
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
as...
as
you
pointed
out,
relation-back
is
not
automatic.
so
there
would
be
these
questions
of
whether
or
not
whatever
criteria
the
court
decides
to
create
for
relation-back
were
satisfied.
and
i
have
to
point
out
the
court
is
going
to
be
creating
all
of
these
rules.
as
it
stands
right
now,
we
have
a
simple
30-day
rule.
once
we
inject
relation-back
and
equitable
considerations,
then
we're
at
sea
in
terms
of
what's
necessary
to
satisfy
this
requirement.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
how
the
court
got
involved
in
these
matters,
in
many
cases
congress
simply
deferred
to...
to
the
courts
to
establish
the
appropriate
procedural
rules.
it
didn't
set
time
limits.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
the
rule's
enabling
act
i
think
is
a...
a
direct
delegation
to
the
courts
to
create
rules
to
govern
practice
and
procedure
where
congress
has
not
otherwise
specified
the
controlling
rules.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
rule
that
congress
has
set,
a
30-day
rule
that
makes
a
great
amount
of
sense
in
these
circumstances,
where
the
object
is
to
determine
fee
litigation
quickly
and
efficiently.
and
if
parties
abide
by
the
rules
and
follow
those
rules,
then
we
can
be
assured
that
these
cases
will
progress
and
that
we
will...
the
courts
and
the
united
states
will
be
not
burdened
with
this
type
of
additional
litigation.
these
are,
after
all,
charges
against
the
treasury,
the
area
where
the
congress'
sovereign
immunity
is
paramount,
and
when
congress--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
our
feeling
is
that
these
showings
can
be
made
very
easily.
you
can
show
that
you're
a
prevailing
party
by
attaching
a
copy
of
your...
your
judgment.
you
can
show
that
you
qualify
for
fees
by
attaching
an
affidavit
showing
you
have
a
net
worth
of
less
than
$2
million.
itemization
is
not
all
that
difficult.
attorneys
keep
these
records.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
that...
that
the
better
rule
is
that
itemization
should
be...
be
complete
at
the
time
the
application
is...
is
filed.
however
we
deal
with
that
issue,
certainly
the
threshold
allegation
that's
at
issue
here
does
need
to
be
made,
and
this
is
the
trigger
that...
that
determines
whether
or
not
the
government
needs
to
respond
to
the
fee
application
at
all.
and
if
the
party
has
not
made
that
basic
determination--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
i
think
it
can
be
described
as
jurisdictional
in
the
sense
that
term
is
used
in
sherwood
v.
united
states,
that
sovereign
immunity
is
a
condition...
the
conditions
of...
that
waive
sovereign
immunity
are
limitations
defining
the
scope
of
the
court's
jurisdiction.
i
think
that's
how
that
terminology
has
become
applied.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
i
think
it
might
be
more
accurate
to
say
it's
a
sovereign
immunity-based
limitation,
but
that
carries
with
it
the
very
same
point.
namely,
it
needs
to
be
strictly
construed.
courts
have
no
power
to
expand
it
beyond
what
its
normal
confines
would
be.
so
the
term
jurisdictional
is
just
a
label.
what's
important
is
the
substance
of
conditions
on
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
is
they
need
to
be
strictly
construed
and
cannot
be
enlarged
beyond
what
congress
has
provided.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
cases
such
as...
some
of
these
cases
are
not
cited
in
the
brief,
but
brokamp,
locke,
a
number
of
these
cases
involving
statutes
of
limitation
where
congress
has...
where
this
court
has
ruled
that
the
emphatic
statute
of
limitation
that
congress
has
set
is
determinative.
i'd
also
point
out
to
justice
frankfurter's
statement
in
holmberg
v.
armbrecht
where
he
said
that
when
congress
sets
a
statute
of
limitation,
there
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
statute
of
limitation
that
congress
set
is
definitive.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
true,
but
again,
i'm
not
sure
a
real
distinction
can
be
made
there
because,
as
i
said
before,
when
we
look
at
what
is
a
fee
application,
we
define
a
fee
application
by
those
things
that
congress
said
are
defined
as
content.
ultimately
i
think
the
important
point
here
is
that
strict
adherence
to
these
types
of
statutory
rules
is
the
best
guarantee
of
fairness
in
these
cases.
this
is
a
case
where
the
burden
that
is
placed
on
the
attorneys
is
minimal
and
we
believe
that
this
court
should
follow
what
congress--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
in
the
case
where--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
and
an
attorney
who
is
careless,
i
would
say,
might
well
have
some
obligation
not
to
charge
his...
his
client
for
his
carelessness.
if
there
are
no
further--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
statute
is
not
so
absolute
actually.
i
believe
the
provision
that
we're
talking
about
here,
which
is
38
u.s.c.
5904,
does
allow
the
court
of
veterans
claims
to
adjust
fee
applications
in
the
event
that
they're
not
fair,
if
there
are
some
inequities
that
are
involved
in
them.
now,
i'm
not
sure
to
what's...
what
extent
the
court
has...
has
exercised
that
authority,
but
it
certainly
has...
does
have
that
authority
under
the
statutory
provisions
that
are
at
issue
here.
