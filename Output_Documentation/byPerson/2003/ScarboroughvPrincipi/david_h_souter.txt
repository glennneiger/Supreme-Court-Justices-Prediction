do
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
any
point
in
requiring
that
allegation
to
be
made
other
than
the
point
that
was
described
in
the
earlier
half
of
the
argument?
and
that
is,
to
put
the...
in
effect,
to...
to
put
the
lawyer
on
notice
that
there
is
a
responsibility
here
to
be
serious
before
one
goes
forward
with
a...
with
fee
litigation
under
this
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
there
any
other
reason
for
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
all
the
united
states
has
to
do,
in
the
absence
of
an...
of
the
allegation,
is
what
it
does
here
and
say,
you
didn't
make
the
allegation.
we
move
to
dismiss.
if
the
lawyer
is
really
serious,
the
lawyer
is
going
to
come
back
and
say,
whoops,
i...
i
do
make
that
allegation.
at
that
point,
the
united
states
knows
where
it
stands
and
presumably
it
has
the...
the
benefit
of
the
lawyer's
sense
of
responsibility
for
going
forward
and
you
go
forward.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's...
that's
true
of
the
doctrine
in
the
first
place,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
we
don't
get
into
relation-back
because
congress
originally
passed
a
statute
saying
there's
going
to
be
relation-back.
in
every
one
of
these
instances
i
suppose
in
which
there
is
a
relaxation
of...
of
a
stated
rule,
we
got
into
it
because
a
court
recognized
it.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
about
the
satellite
litigation
at
most
means
maybe
we'll
have
a
half
a
dozen
cases
deciding
exactly
what
exceptions
to
the...
to
the
literal
statement
in
the
statute
book
there
may
be,
but
as...
as
against
eaja
litigation
in
which
there
are
at
least
500
a
year
on...
in
the
courts
around
the
country
on
social
security
alone,
that
seems
to
be
rather
a...
a
minuscule
percentage
of...
of
extra
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
it
say
we
are
deferring
to
the
courts
to...
to
set
procedural
rules?
i
doubt
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
congress
simply
pass
a
statute
and
somebody
says,
well,
gee,
does...
does
the
30
days...
is
the
30
days
absolute
or
not?
