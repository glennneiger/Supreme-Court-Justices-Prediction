justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfman,
if
you're
right
about
that
it's
not
jurisdictional,
so
there
should
be
equitable
tolling,
why
should
there
be
equitable...
what's
equitable
about
allowing
a
lawyer
to
overcome
his
carelessness?
i
mean,
the...
the
case
of
a
layperson
not
getting
a
verification
is
one
thing.
a
lawyer
reads
a
statute,
it
says,
do
this,
that,
and
the
other,
and
he
doesn't
do
the
other,
and
then
it
says,
oh,
but
be
equitable,
court.
why
should
a
lawyer's
carelessness
be
an
occasion
for
equitable
tolling?
is
there
anything
in
it
for
the
client
if
this
is
just
the
lawyer's
fee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfman--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfman,
i
was
surprised
that
you
didn't
cite
1653
of
title
28
which
says
defective
allegations
of
jurisdiction
may
be
amended
upon
terms.
i
mean,
if
you
say,
okay,
even
assuming
it
were
jurisdictional,
if
it
were
jurisdictional...
even
if
it
were
jurisdictional,
you
could
still
amend
with
the
court's
permission.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
the...
the
federal
circuit
obviously
doesn't
agree
entirely
with
the
position
you're
now
saying,
you
have
to
do
everything
up
front.
and
what
struck
me
as
curious
is
the
federal
circuit
allows
you
to
flesh
out
allegations.
so,
for
example,
you
say
i...
i
want
a
fee
of
$1,000
but
you
don't
put
in
the
itemization.
as
i
understand
the
federal
circuit's
position,
they
allow
you
to
flesh
out
something
that...
that
really
seems
to
me
is
a
lot
more
substantial,
to
document
your
fee.
but
this
is
a
pro
forma
allegation.
so
it
seems
to
me,
if
you're
saying...
if
you're
taking
the
position
you
must
do
everything
within
30
days,
then
you
would
have
to
say
the
federal
circuit
is
wrong
in
saying
you
can
flesh
out
allegations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
they
have
to
comply.
the
question
is
can
they
be
excused
if
they're
a
little
late.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
a
relation-back
doctrine
that
courts
were
applying
before
it
was
codified
in
15(c)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
in
states...
some
states
also
had
a
relation-back
doctrine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
can
i
ask
you
to
go
back?
because
i
don't
think
you...
the
relation-back,
if
it
goes
by
rule
15(c),
it's
not
just
that
you
have
an
absolute
right.
15(c)(3)
makes
it
very
clear
that
if
there's
prejudice
to
one
side,
it
doesn't
relate
back.
it
isn't
an
automatic
thing
that,
oh,
you
can
always
make
up
for
not
having--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
isn't...
it
isn't...
it
isn't
automatic.
it
has
to
be
that
the
other
side
knew
or
should
have
known
that
but
for
a
mistake,
that
you
would
have
put
this
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
made
a
distinction
in
your
brief.
you
said,
well,
rule
15(c)
is
a
pleading
rule.
this
is
not
a
pleading.
this
is
an
application
for
a
fee.
so
i
say,
yes,
it
is
an
application
for
a
fee,
not
a
pleading,
but
why
should
that
make
any
difference
to
the
concept
of
relation-back?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that...
well,
that
answer
does...
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it's
labeled
a
pleading
or
an
application.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
second
major
litigation
i
don't
see.
i
see
you
have
to
make
the
motion
to
dismiss,
but
beyond
that...
and
once
the
allegation
is
made,
it,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
is
the
government's
burden
to
show
that
its
position
was
substantially
justified.
so
what
is
the
satellite
litigation
beyond
your
filing
the
motion
to
dismiss
because
they
didn't
make
the
allegation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
this...
but
once
the
court
decides
this
case
and
suppose
it
should
say
that
relation-back
applies,
well,
that's...
that
would
be
it
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
satellite
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
mr.
minear,
i
know
you've
said
it's
not
before
us,
but
would
you
make
a
distinction,
the
one
that
this
federal
circuit
makes
between
you
don't
account
for...
for
the
fees
and
so
you
want
later
to
document
what...
what
supports
your...
your
requests
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
itemization
is...
is
what
the
federal
circuit
allows
leeway
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i...
i
wanted
to
see
your
fix
on
the
statute.
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
federal
circuit
is
wrong
to
allow
any
leeway
on...
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
he
have
that
obligation?
because
the
statute
is
absolute.
it
says
you
can
get
20
percent
of
the
recovery.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
each
party
to
a
lawsuit
in
the
united
states
ordinarily
pays
his
or
her
own
counsel
fees.
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
or
eaja
departs
from
that
general
rule.
under
eaja,
a
party
who
wins
its
suit
against
the
united
states
maybe
awarded
attorney’s
fees,
but
the
government
may
defeat
a
fee
award
by
showing
that
the
position
it
took
in
the
litigation
was
substantially
justified.
under
eaja,
the
party
who
prevails
against
the
government
has
30-days
from
the
court’s
final
judgment
to
apply
for
fees.
eaja
prescribes
the
contents
of
the
fee
application.
among
other
things,
the
applicant
must
itemize
the
amount
sought.
eaja
further
instructs
the
fee
applicant,
to
allege
that
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
not
substantially
justified.
we
resolve
today
a
matter
of
time,
a
question
on
which
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
divided.
may
a
fee
application
filed
on
time
be
amended
after
the
30
day
filing
period
has
run,
to
cure
an
applicant’s
initial
oversight
in
failing
to
allege
that
the
government’s
position
in
the
case
lacks
substantial
justification?
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
answered
that
question,
no,
holding
a
curative
amendment
impermissible.
we
answer,
yes,
and
therefore
reverse
the
court
of
appeal’s
judgment.
petitioner
scarborough
sued
the
secretary
a
veterans
affairs
for
disability
benefits
and
gained
a
favorable
judgment.
scarborough’s
counsel
filed
a
timely
application
for
fees
under
eaja,
but
initially
failed
to
allege
that
the
position
taken
by
the
united
states
was
not
substantially
justified.
alerted
to
the
omission,
counsel
promptly
filed
a
curative
amendment,
but
by
then
the
30-day
deadline
had
passed.
the
amendment
came
too
late
the
federal
circuit
said,
and
for
that
reason
it
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
scarborough’s
fee
application,
for
it
said,
“lack
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction”.
the
fee
application
we
hold
must
be
entertained.
the
question
whether
scarborough
is
time
barred
from
gaining
a
fee
award,
we
first
clarify,
does
not
bear
on
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
prescriptions
on
subject-matter
jurisdiction
described
what
classes
of
cases
a
court
is
competent
to
adjudicate.
the
eaja
provision
at
issue
is
not
of
that
genre,
it
concerns
only
a
mode
of
relief
counsel
fees,
awardable
in
cases
undeniably
within
the
court’s
adjudicatory
authority.
dispute
here
is
not
over
whether,
but
when
an
eaja
fee
applicant
must
allege
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
not
substantially
justified.
two
prior
decisions
inform
our
judgment,
in
edelman
against
lynchburg
college,
a
2002
decision,
we
sustained
a
regulation
allowing
amendment
of
a
title
vii
employment
discrimination
charge
after
the
filing
deadline
to
supply
an
initially
missing
verification
of
the
charge
by
"oath
or
affirmation".
the
tidy
verification
we
held
related
back
to
the
timely
filed
charge.
the
year
before
edelman
and
becker
v.
montgomery,
we
held
that
a
pro
se
litigant's
failure
to
hand
sign
a
timely
filed
notice
of
appeal
could
be
cured
after
the
filing
deadline
expired.
like
the
verification
requirement
in
edelman
and
the
signature
requirement
in
becker,
the
allegation
at
issue
here,
serves
no
notice
giving
function,
the
government
is
well
aware
from
the
moment
the
fee
application
is
filed
that
to
defeat
the
application
on
the
merits,
it
will
have
to
prove
that
its
position
was
substantially
justified.
essentially,
the
required
allegation
is
a
“think
twice”
pleading
prescription
designed
to
dampen
the
urge
to
litigate
irresponsibly.
the
allegation
serves
also
to
shift
to
the
government
the
burden
to
prove
that
the
position
it
took
in
the
underlying
litigation
was
substantially
justified.
the
relation-back
principle
as
our
decisions
indicate,
guides
our
determination
today.
scarborough's
amended
application
arose
out
of
the
occurrence
set
forth
or
attempted
to
be
set
forth,
in
his
timely-filed
original
application.
it
therefore
related
back
to
the
original
filing
and
effectively
repaired
counsel’s
initial
omission.
two
further
points;
first,
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
does
not
stand
in
the
way
of
an
eaja
fee
recovery.
once
congress
waives
sovereign
immunity,
time
limitations
generally
apply
to
the
government,
just
as
they
would
apply
to
private
parties.
second,
our
decision
will
not
expose
the
government
to
any
unfair
imposition;
or
showing
a
prejudice
to
the
government
would
preclude
operation
of
the
relation-back
doctrine
and
eaja
itself
has
a
built-in
check.
the
statute
disallows
a
fee
award
when
special
circumstances
make
an
award
unjust.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
