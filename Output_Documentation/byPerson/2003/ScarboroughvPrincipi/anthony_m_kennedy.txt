are
there
any
instances
in
which
the
government
is
liable
for
fees
even
if
its
position
was
substantially
justified?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
think
you
know
where
i
was
going.
was...
was
the
government
somehow
puzzled
or
confused
when
it
received
this
document
or
did
it
naturally
assume
that
it
would
have
to
show
that
this
position
was
substantially
justified?
in
other
words,
would
there
have
been
some
other
theory
in
which
the
government
might
have
thought
it
would
have
been
really
liable
for
these
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
issue
we're...
we're
talking
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
in
this...
in
this
case
the
application
did
say
that
it
was
pursuant
to
2412.
so
as
i
indicated
and
justice
o'connor
said,
the
government
was
under
no...
no
mistaken
assumptions
about
the
applicability
of
this
section
and
this
section
only.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
other
than
that,
the
government
has
not
really
been
prejudiced
in
anyway.
the
government
knows
of
the
substantial
justification
rule
and
it's
either
ready
to
defend
or...
or
acquiesce
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you...
can
you
give
me
any
indication
of
how...
how
many
of
these
applications
there
are,
how
many
times
the
government
contests
the
substantial
justification,
how
many
times
the
government
concedes
that?
does
the
government
ever
concede
no
substantial
justification?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
any
indication
of
what
percentage
that
is
out
of
the
total?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what's
your
best
case
in
support
of
your
position
of
a
strict
interpretation
of
a
requirement
like
this,
other
than
cases
about
sovereign
immunity
being...
it
can't
be
expanded?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
locke
was
a
case
involving
a
total
failure
to
file
on
time,
not
omitting
an
allegation
in
the
filing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
burden
of
the
real
result
is
placed
on
the
client.
i
mean,
the
burden...
the...
the
real
loser
here
is
not
the
lawyer.
it's
the
client.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
lawyer
gets
the
same
amount
in
any
event
in
many,
many
cases.
