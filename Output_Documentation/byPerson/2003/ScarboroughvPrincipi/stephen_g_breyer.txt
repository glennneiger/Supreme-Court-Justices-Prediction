justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
easily
just
reduce
it
if
it
was
the
lawyer's
negligence
and
stopped
him
getting
the
contingency.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
then
we're
back
to
where
justice
ginsburg's
question
was.
you
say,
really,
the
person
who
should
suffer
is
the
lawyer,
if
the
lawyer
is
negligent,
not
the
client.
that
would
be
pretty
easy
to
arrange.
and
you
really
want
a
rule
that
says
whenever
the
lawyer
is
negligent,
well,
the
other
side
has
to
suffer
the
consequence
rather
than
the
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
couldn't
you
do
it
under
a
rule
of
the
court?
why
couldn't
you
just
say...
i
mean,
if
i
were
sitting
in
that
court,
it
wouldn't
take
me
long
to
try
to
figure
that
out
unless
congress
thought
of...
unless
it
forbid
it
somewhere.
i
mean,
if
it
forbid
it,
you
couldn't
do
it,
but...
but
i
don't
know...
what
you've
read
me
doesn't
sound
as
if
it
forbids
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
anyway,
okay,
let's
skip
that
because
the
question
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let's
go
back
to
the
main
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there...
there
is
an
argument
the
other
side
i'd
like
you
to
deal
with.
there's
a...
you...
you
look
at
the
statute,
and
it
looks
like
congress
was
intending
to
have
in
front
of
the
judge
and
in
particular
to
have
in
front
of
the
government
all
the
facts
right
there
the
first
day.
there
are
a
lot
of
these
things.
they
have
to
process
them
quickly
and
they
want
to
decide
whether
to
settle
it
or
not
settle
it.
and
what
they
have,
therefore,
you
say
right
in
the
application
within
30
days.
did
i
win?
it's
not
so
clear
sometimes
because,
you
know,
they're
mixed
claims.
explain
it.
show
that
you're
eligible
and
also
say
how
much
it's
going
to
be.
right
there,
first
from
day
one.
and
although
this
next
part
is
a
formality
and
is
in
a
separate
sentence,
that
doesn't
matter.
it
happens
to
be
really
in
the
same
two
sentences
and
there's
no
reason
to
treat
it
differently.
all
right?
so
that's
their
argument.
and
now
i'd
like
to
see
what
your
response
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
do
that.
you
might
do
that.
so
that...
that's...
in
other
words,
you're
saying...
that's
irwin.
i
mean,
you're
arguing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
you
want
to
say
that
that
would
apply
to
every
one
of
these
four
provisions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and...
and
treat
them
all
alike
and
therefore
the
separate
sentence
is
a
kind
of
make-way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--aside
from
that,
now...
now
take
the
other
part
of
your
argument
and
say,
no,
no,
it's
really
different,
this
fourth
one.
this
fourth
one
is
really
different.
and
i
got
it
that
it's
in
a
separate
sentence.
i
don't
know
how
much
to
make
of
that.
is
there...
is
there
any
other
basis
for
saying...
i
mean,
maybe
that's
conclusive.
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
everything
in
front
of
me
that
would
make
it
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
the...
the
problem
with
this...
and
there
is
a
problem
maybe
just
for
me,
but
there's
a
lot
of
legislative
history
here
that
says
that,
for
example,
the
deadline
for
filing
the
fee
application
is
jurisdictional
and
cannot
be
waived.
and
then
there
are
a
lot
of
other
stuff.
the
administrative
conference
has
said
you
ought
to
make
this
subject
to
waiver
for
good
cause,
and
that
was
rejected.
and
so
there
is
a
lot
of
history
that
says
you
just
can't
do
an
irwin
kind
of
thing.
we
don't
mean
that.
we
don't
mean
you
can
waive
this.
now,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sort
of
parse
the
thing
and
say,
well,
this...
this
portion
of
it
is...
is
subject
to
the
equitable
exception
and
the
doctrine
itself...
the...
the
application
itself
is
not
subject
to
it?
or
how
am
i
supposed
to
handle
that
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
doesn't
all
that
fit
within
a...
an
equitable
exceptions
doctrine
because
that's
one
of
the
things
you
take
into
account?
my
basic
question
is,
why
not
read
the
statute
of
limitations...
say
what
this
court
said
in
irwin
and
others...
as
they're
normally
read
subject
to
equitable
exceptions?
or
at
least
if
the...
if
the
legislative
history
makes
that
impossible...
and
i
was
just
told
it
doesn't
at
all...
read
the
filing
of
the
paper
as
absolute
but
the
contents
of
the
paper
is
subject
to
equitable
exceptions?
so
you'll
win
99
percent
of
the
time.
it's
just
the
lawyer
really
had
a
heart
attack
on
the
way
to
the
post
office,
you
know.
i
mean,
something
awful
came
up
and
why
not
give
him
the
advantage
of
that
equitable
exception?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no,
but
i
mean,
we're
trying
to
interpret
this
statute.
and
would
it
be...
is
there
any
reason
not
to
interpret
the
statute...
whether
they
win
or
they
lose
in
this
particular
case
is
a
matter
of
lesser
importance
perhaps,
but
not
to
them,
but
to...
to
others.
but
to
get
the
statute
right
is
important.
and...
and
therefore,
do
you
think
the
correct
interpretation
of
this
statute
is
like
other
statutes,
as
i
said,
a,
subject
to
equitable
exceptions
or,
b,
at
least
the
content
of
the
document
is
subject
to
equitable
exceptions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
knew
you
would
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
he...
is
there
any
other
reason?
so
far
what
i've
registered
in
my
mind
is
the
statute
says
nothing
about
equitable
exceptions
one
way
or
the
other.
the
difference
between
this
statute
and
a
lot
of
other
government
statutes
of
limitations
is
in
the
other
ones,
they're
creating
an
equality
between
government
liability
and
private
party
liability,
and
in
this
one
it's
only
the
government
that
would
be
liable
for
the
fees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there
anything
else?
that's
quite
a...
it's
a
formal
reason
but
an
important
formal
reason.
is
there
any
other
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
that's
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
in
the...
i
mean,
you've
raised
a
number
of...
of
very
good
points
that
make
this
quite
complicated,
and
i'm
looking
to
try
to
simplify
it
in
my
own
mind.
could
we
say...
and
you'll...
could
we
say
that
in
respect
to
the
30-day
filing
requirement,
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
it
is
absolute
or
not
absolute,
subject
to
equitable
defenses
of
different
kinds
or
not.
in
respect
to
the
content
parts
of
this,
at
least
the
fourth
part,
it's
treated
like
any
statute
of
limitations,
any
ordinary
statute
of
limitations,
and
whatever
they're
subject
to,
judge,
you
make
this
one
subject
to.
now,
there
you'd
meet
me
with
the
argument
but
this
is
the
government
and...
the
one
we
went
through.
is
there
any
other
reason
for
not
doing
it?
