justice
john
paul
stevens
--will
you
just
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
i
want...
i
think
i
understood
your
answer,
but...
to
justice
ginsburg,
but
if
he
has
a
contingent
fee
of
20
percent,
he
gets
a
$1,000
recovery
and
a
$200
fee,
and
he
goes...
now
he
gets...
files
an
eaja
position,
if
he
recovers
precisely
$200,
that
goes
to
the
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
recovered
$300?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
all
events,
the
client
would
get
a
piece
of
the
recovery
under
eaja.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
a
contingency
fee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
are...
typically
they
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--contingent
fee
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
minear,
can
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
basic
question?
sometimes
these
things
are
negotiated
i
think,
aren't
they?
after
the
fee
application
is
filed,
the
counsel
may
meet
and
discuss
whether
they
can
settle
the
fee
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
during...
if
such
a
meeting
took
place
15
days
after
the
application
was
filed,
do
you
think
the
government
lawyer
would
have
an
ethical
duty
to
tell
the
plaintiff's
lawyer...
say,
you
goofed
and
forgot
the
no-substantial-justification
allegation
in
your...
in
your
request?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
timeliness
argument
is
somewhat
strange
in
this
case
because
he
filed
the
application
prematurely,
as
i
remember
the
case,
didn't
he?
and
then
said,
no,
you
got
to
wait
until
the
mandate
comes
down,
and
then
after
the
mandate
came
down,
he
refiled
it,
and
then
the
30
days
went
by
and
the
government
asked
for
an
extension.
it
didn't...
to
get
it...
to
get
it
disposed
of.
so
the
government's
argument
that
you've
got
to
get
this
done
as
fast
as
possible
seems
a
little
strange
in
this
particular
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
took
more
than
30
days
to
respond.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
wanted
to
wait
and
see
whether
he'd
catch
his
goof.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
you
another
question,
if
i
may.
supposing
that
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
has
trouble
finishing
his
time
sheets.
it's
a
long,
protracted
case,
and
just
before
he
filed
the
fee
application,
he
called
the
government
lawyer
and
said,
i
don't
think
i
can
get
my
time
statement
in
in
30
days.
will
you
agree
to
a
2-week
extension?
would
the
government
lawyer
have
authority
to
grant
that...
to...
to
stipulate
to
such
a
2-week
extension?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
characterize
it
as
a
trigger.
do
you
defend
the
court
of
appeals'
characterization
of
the
requirement
as
a
jurisdictional
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
answer
is
yes.
