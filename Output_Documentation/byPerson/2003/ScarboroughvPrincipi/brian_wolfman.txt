mr.
brian
wolfman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1999,
randall
scarborough
won
his
disability
appeal
before
the
veterans
court
on
the
ground
that
the
government's
position
constituted
clear
and
unmistakable
error
and
that
that
position
was,
quote,
not
reasonably
debatable.
end
quote.
he
then
immediately
filed
a
fee
application
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
that
contained
three
of
the
elements
called
for
by
the
act,
but
it
did
not
initially
allege
that
the
government's
position
lacked
substantial
justification.
the
government
seized
on
that
alleged
omission
and
without
any
mention
of
this
court's
path-marking
decision
in
irwin
v.
veterans
affairs,
both
it
and
the
federal
circuit
determined
that
this
omission
of
this
legal
conclusion
was
jurisdictional,
meaning
in
effect
that
mr.
scarborough's
amendment
to
the
application
could
not
relate
back
to
his
timely
filed
application.
the
federal
circuit
and
the
government
persisted
in
this
view
even
after
this
court
remanded
in
light
of
edelman
v.
lynchburg
college,
which
embraced
the
relation-back
doctrine
both
in
a
judicial
and
an
administrative
law
context.
the
federal
circuit's
fundamental
error
here,
the
basic
mistake,
is
that
it
perceived
eaja's
limitations
period
as
jurisdictional.
as
i
said,
that
holding
can't
be
squared
with
the
decision
in
irwin
or
as
reiterated
by
this
court
just
two
terms
ago
in
franconia
associates,
and
that
principle
is
this.
unless
congress
has
provided
otherwise,
limitations
periods
that
run
in
favor
of
the
government
like
those
involving
private
parties
are
not
jurisdictional,
but
rather
are
subject
to
ordinary
statute
of
limitations
principles
that
provide
exceptions
under
certain
circumstances.
and
so
then
the
question
is,
what
does
eaja
say
to
this?
there's
nothing
in
eaja
that
even
hints
that
the
statute
creates
the
absolute--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--equal
access
to
justice
act.
that's
the
acronym,
your
honor.
there...
there's
nothing
that
even
hints
that
the
court...
that
the
congress
created
that
type
of
absolute
time
bar
under
eaja.
in
fact,
quite
the
contrary.
the
statute
makes
clear
that
a
court
entertaining
an
eaja
application
already
has
jurisdiction
over
the
action.
simply
put,
eaja
can't
be
jurisdictional
in
that
sense,
absolute
in
that
sense,
because
as
this
court
just
reiterated
in
kontrick
v.
ryan,
eaja
doesn't
serve
to
place
a
class
of
cases
within
a
court's
adjudicative
authority.
mr.
brian
wolfman
no.
well,
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that,
but
let
me
take
the
last
part
first,
your
honor.
first
is
that
here
actually
the...
the
client
has
much
coming.
these
are
the
client's
fees,
and
the
veterans
statutes
provide
that
the
contingent
fee,
which
cannot
exceed
20
percent,
would
be
reduced
dollar
for
dollar
by
the
eaja
recovery.
so
the
client
here,
as
all
veterans
claims,
do
have
money
at
stake.
let
me
turn
to
the
question
of
equitable
tolling
that
you
asked.
mr.
brian
wolfman
by
the
eaja
recovery,
yes.
the...
the
statute...
the...
the
veterans
statutes
provide
that
the
lawyer
can
enter
a
contingency
arrangement
with
the
client,
but
that
the
fee
can't...
can't
exceed
20
percent
of
the
claimant's
back
benefits
if
he
or
she
prevails.
but
when--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
so
there...
there
can
be
no
fee
taken
unless
there's
victory.
the
statute
also
provides
that.
however,
a...
a
statute
also
provides
on
what
do
we
do
about
the
interaction
between
eaja
and
this
statutory
contingency
fee.
and
what
it
provides
is
that
for
the
same
work,
if
there
is
an
eaja
recovery,
the
client
must
benefit
by
that.
there
can't
be
a
double
recovery
and
that
the
contingent
fee
would
be
reduced
dollar
for
dollar
for
the
eaja
recovery.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
correct,
but
the
law
does
not
provide.
mr.
brian
wolfman
your...
your
honor,
first,
there
could
be
such
a
rule
if
congress
so
provided,
and
i
suppose--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i
think
it
is
true
that
the...
the
statutes
that
i've
just
talked
about
don't
forbid
that.
whether
rulemaking
authority
enters
into
that
kind
of
substantive
arena,
i
think
that
would
be
unusual
because
ordinarily
that
would
be
governed
by
state
malpractice--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i
think
that's...
that's
what
the--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--the
question--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--question
of
equitable
tolling,
if
i
might.
and...
and
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
category
of
equitable
tolling
that's
set
out
in
the
irwin
decision
and
others
which
if...
if
a
claimant
filed...
timely
files
a...
an
action,
that...
that
is
properly
filed
but
jurisdictionally
defective
in
some
way,
that
equitable
tolling
is
a...
is
a
basis
for
allowing
some
forbearance
in
that
circumstance--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--we...
your
honor,
with
all
respect,
no.
the
split
was
not
on
the
question
of
what
the...
this...
whether
the
statute
requires
the
allegation
of
no
substantial
justification
in
the
30
days.
the
split
was
on
the
question--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--we
do
and
we
briefed
that
extensively
both
in
our
opening
brief
and
our...
and
our
reply
brief.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i'd
be
happy
to
address
it
right
now
if...
if
your
honor
will
allow,
which
is
that--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--let
me
answer
that.
the...
the
answer
is
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
first...
the
first
sentence
of
(d)...
of
section
(d)(1)(a)...
(d)(1)(b)...
excuse
me...
says
that
there
shall
be
three
things
alleged
and
that
they
must
be
done
within
30
days.
the
next
sentence,
which
is
the
one
that
is
at
issue
here,
says
that
the...
the
parties
shall
also
allege
that
the
position
of
the
government
is
not
substantially
justified,
and
that
sentence
does
not
include
the
30-day
time
limit.
that
is
one
of
our
arguments
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
wolfman
it
is.
mr.
brian
wolfman
and
that...
we
make
that
argument
directly
in
our
brief.
mr.
brian
wolfman
but,
your
honor,
we
disagree
and
the
reason
is
it's
in
that
separate
sentence
and
there
are
subsequent
proceedings
in
the
case.
there
are
subsequent
filings
made.
there
are
sometimes
hearings
where
that--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that...
that
is--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
on
that
question,
the...
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
that
its
position
was
substantially
justified.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
our
submission.
so
the
question
is
why
might
congress
have
parsed
it
in
this
way.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that...
that
is
correct
in
the
sense
that...
that
the
statute
is
unusual
and
that
it...
it's...
it
does
say
that
the
party
seeking
fees
shall
allege
the
position
of
the
government
lacks
substantial
justification.
but
there's
no
question...
and
it
is
conceded
here
that
the
government
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
that
question.
so
in...
in
this
respect--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--your
honor,
it--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--we--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--no.
we...
we
believe
that
at
some
point
the
statute
makes
clear
that
at
some
point
the
applicant
will
have
to
make
that
allegation.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i
think
the--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--in
all
candor,
your
honor,
the
most
logical
point
is
at
the
outset.
mr.
brian
wolfman
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
but
our
position
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
the
statute
doesn't
contain
that
30-day
limit
within
the
second
sentence,
and
following
on
justice
o'connor's
question,
there
is
potentially
good
reason
for
that
which
is
that
the
burden
on
that
question
is
on
the
government.
we
don't
know
why
because
it
is
not
revealed
entirely
why
the
30-day
limit
is
not
in
the
second
sentence.
mr.
brian
wolfman
the
30-day...
well,
that
is
our
position,
your
honor,
and
i
think...
i
think
we've
exhausted
the
reasons
why
congress
might
have
done
it.
may
i
go
back
to
the
initial
question?
because
i
want
to...
i
want
to
clarify
something.
i
initially
got
a
question
about
equitable
tolling,
but
our
principal
submission
here
and
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
resolve
this
case
is
that
this...
this
provision
is
not
jurisdictional.
mr.
scarborough
filed
on
time,
and
so
it's
a
perfect
example
of
where
the
relation-back
doctrine
would
apply.
this
is
a
typical
relation-back
situation.
the...
the
application
was
filed.
it
was
timely.
there
was
an
omission
and
mr.
scarborough,
immediately
upon
the
omission
being
brought
to
his
attention,
filed
an
amendment
that
made
this
10...
this
10-word
legal
conclusion,
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
brian
wolfman
then
the
$100...
then
$200
would
go
to
the
client
and
$100
would
go
to
the
lawyer.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
correct
unless,
for
some
reason,
there
was
not
a
contingency
fee.
that
is
correct.
mr.
brian
wolfman
right.
mr.
brian
wolfman
and...
and
in
almost
all
cases--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--there
is.
yes.
mr.
brian
wolfman
in
almost
all
cases
there
are.
and
as
i
say,
the
statute
allows
it
up
to
but
not
in
excess
of
20
percent.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
and
that
was
approximately
33
days
after
the
30-day
period
expired.
mr.
brian
wolfman
my
response
is...
and
if
i
understand
the
question...
is
take...
to
take
as
a
given
that
the...
that
the
statutes
contemplates
that
the
no-substantial-justification
allegation
be
made
within
the
30
days.
and
then
our
response
is
that
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
provision.
the
statute
does
not
create
an
absolute
bar,
and
then
we
look
to
the
common
law
exceptions
to
statutes
of
limitations.
mr.
brian
wolfman
it's
irwin.
it's...
it's
edelman.
it's
becker
and
so
forth.
mr.
brian
wolfman
it
would
and
the
courts--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--no.
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
your
question...
i...
i
took
your
question
to
ask
me
to
assume
that
all
four
allegations
have
to
be
made
within
the
30
days.
mr.
brian
wolfman
if
i
assume
that,
then
yes,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
that
we
would
apply
those
ordinary
common
law
exceptions.
now,
judges--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i
think
the
other
thing
that...
that
i
would
like
to
put
in
front
of
you...
and
this
had
to
do
with
my
colloquy
with
justice
o'connor...
which
is
that
there
is
a
different
character
that...
to
that
allegation.
it
is
a
mere
allegation
and
it
simply
notifies
the
government
about
its
substantial
justification
defense.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i
think
that
is
a
fair
point,
your
honor,
and
let
me
answer
that
this
way.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i
got
that,
and
let...
if...
if
i
might
let
me
answer
that.
because
then
i
think
if
we
conceive
of
the
purpose
of
this
allegation
as
making
a
lawyer
think
twice,
then
it
puts
the
case
in
the
realm
of
edelman
and
becker
where
in
becker
you
had
a
signature
requirement,
edelman
you
had
a
verification
requirement,
and
those...
those
requirements
are
things
that
are
supposed
to
make
the
filing
party
think
a
little
bit
before
he
or
she
does
the
filing.
but
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
said,
okay,
we
realize
the
purpose
of
it,
but
we
will
still
allow
supplication...
supplementation
of
the
application,
and
we'll
allow
them
to
amend
and
to
relate
back
unless
the
adverse
party
is
prejudiced.
and
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
the
prejudice
here.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
with...
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
that
might
in
part,
at
least
in
part,
explain
edelman.
but
i
do
not
believe
it
explains
becker.
becker
did
involve
a
pro
se
applicant,
but
as
we
know,
most
appellants
in
the
courts
are...
are
parties
that
are
represented
by
lawyers,
and
becker
held
unequivocally
that
the
failure
to
sign
was
not
fatal
and
that,
in
fact,
the...
the
amended,
signed
notice
of
appeal
could
relate
back.
and
that's
all
that's
being
requested
here.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor,
and
that
is
neglectful
on
our
part
and
we
could
have...
we
could
have
cited
1653
as
well.
it
stands
for
the
same
principle
i
think
as
the--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
that...
that
is
true
too.
mr.
brian
wolfman
right.
and...
and--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--it's
not.
and...
and
i
think
that's
the
key
point.
it
is
not
and
the...
the
irwin
and
franconia
associates
i
think
so
clearly
stand
for
that
proposition.
that
is
the
argument
that
we
went
to
first
and
most
directly,
that
unless
congress
explicitly
provides
otherwise,
limitations
periods
will
be
governed
by
the
same
types
of
limitations
principles
that...
that
govern
private
litigation.
mr.
brian
wolfman
no.
i
think
there
are
limits.
for...
and...
and
i
think--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--a
court
would
look
to
rule
15
which
codifies
the
relation-back
doctrine
and
says,
number
one,
does
it...
does
the
matter
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction
as
occurrence...
as
the
original
filing.
does
it
arise
out
of
the
same
thing
that
the
adverse
party
was
given
notice
of?
and
then
i
think
the
other
thing
that's
quite...
that's
quite
apparent
the
courts
would
apply
is,
is
the
other
side
prejudiced
by
this?
how
long
of
a
time
period
had
gone
by?
how
important
or
how
new
is
the
information?
here,
there's
never
been
any
claim
of
prejudice
nor
could
there
be,
i
don't
think,
because
the
government
responds...
they
point
out
that...
that
this
legal
allegation
was
not
made.
the
other
side
comes
in
and
immediately
amends
or...
and...
and
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
this
matter
would
have
been
resolved
years
ago
if
that
had
transpired.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
claim
for
relation-back,
and
the
reason
is
is
because
the
court...
the
state
apparently
has
said,
as
a
matter
of
our
substantive
policy,
that
we
want
to
give
notice
of
this
type
of
claim
much
earlier.
mr.
brian
wolfman
but
let
me
answer
that--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--but
might
i
extend
my
answer
a
little
bit?
mr.
brian
wolfman
because...
because
i...
i
think
your
hypothetical
stands
in
contradistinction
from
the
ordinary
rule,
that
if
you've
alleged
the...
the
relevant
facts,
you
can...
actually
amendment
is
freely
given
to...
to
state
the
legal
theory
under
which
those
facts
arise.
and
i
cite
those
cases
in
my
brief.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that...
that
is
correct
that...
that
you
have
to
state
jurisdiction
and
you
have
to
state
the
facts.
and
the...
the
forms
that
appear
at
the
end
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
do
say
that
the...
the
pleader
ought
to
state
the...
the
type
of
action,
whether
it
be
negligence
or
otherwise.
but
i
think
it
does
stand
in
distinction
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
where
the
state
has
made
very
clear
that
there
is
a
substantive
policy
that
we
want
to
follow
such
that
we
want
to
give
more
notice
and
quicker
notice
of
this
type
of
action.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
we
deal
with
the
legislative
history
in
quite
some
detail
in
our
reply
brief,
but
let
me...
let
me
deal
with
it
briefly
here,
which
is
that
the...
the
one
line
that
you
quoted
about
the
jurisdiction...
the
application
is
jurisdictional
and
cannot
be
waived
was
in
a...
a
committee
report
that
was
submitted
with
legislation
that
was
vetoed
by
the
president.
the
next
year
when
the
legislation
was
actually
enacted,
very
similar
legislative
history
appears,
and
it's...
it
drops
that
line
and
says
as
follows.
the
court
should
avoid
an
overly
technical
construction
of
these
terms,
the
terms
being
the
30-day
rule.
this
section
should
not
be
used
as
a
trap
for
the
unwary
resulting
in
the
unwarranted
denial
of
fees.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that's
in
the
legislative
history
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
brian
wolfman
it's
a
house
report
no.
99-120
at...
at
page
6,
footnote
26.
but
it...
what
i'm...
what
i'm
getting
at
is
the
legislative
history,
from
which
this
was
taken,
the
one
line
that
they
rely
on,
was...
accompanied
legislation
that
was
actually
vetoed.
it
was
then
replaced
by
other
legislative
history
which
supports
our
position.
i
want
to
be
clear.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
legislative
history,
either
way,
bears
great
weight,
and
we
don't
rely
on
it
in
our
opening
brief.
but
to
respond
to
that
question,
i
think
the
legislative
history
at
best
for...
for
the
government
is
a
wash.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i'd
like
to
go
immediately
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
he
asked
about
the
best
case.
well,
the
case
that
the
government
relies
on
principally
in
its
brief
is
soriano
v.
the
united
states.
the
problem
with
that
case
is
it
was
overruled
by
irwin,
and
the
problem
here
is
that
the
principle
we're
now
operating
on,
the
problem
with
the
government,
is
that
when
we
talk
about
statutes
of
limitations
principles,
you
apply
the
same
principles
that
apply
among
private
parties
unless
congress
explicitly
provides
otherwise.
now,
i
did
want
to,
if
i
might,
turn
to
the
relation-back
doctrine
just
briefly.
and
the...
the
question
arose
in
mr.
minear's
presentation,
well,
this
case
doesn't
involve
rule
15(c).
but
either
did
edelman
v.
lynchburg
college.
edelman
is
best
read
as
a
case
that
applied
the
common
law
doctrine
of
relation-back.
the
court
held,
regardless
of
the
eeoc's
regulation,
even
if
we
were
interpreting
the
statute
from
scratch,
we
would
apply
the
relation
doctrine
back
here
because
it
has
a
common
law
pedigree.
and
that's
all
we're
asking
for
here.
the
other
principal
submission
by
mr.
minear
is
the
efficiency
argument,
that
these
matters
have
to
be
done
promptly
and
efficiently
and
there's
thousands
of
suits.
i
have
two
basic
answers
to
that,
the
general
and
the
specific.
the
general
is
that
the...
until
the
federal
circuit
ruled,
this
was
the
rule,
the
rule
that
we're
asking
for,
in
all
of
the
circuits
that
had
ruled
on
it.
and
the
government
does
not
present
an
iota
of
evidence
there
were
any
problems
in
applying
the
relation-back
principle
in
those
circuits.
it's
the
third,
the
sixth,
and
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
specific
answer
is
i
think
we
know
what
would
have
happened
in
this
case
if
my
client's
amendment
had
related
back.
the
matter
would
have
been
resolved
3
or
4
years
ago.
there
is
no
serious
efficiency
concern
here.
the
reason
we're
here
much
later
is
both
because
the
government
interposed
this
jurisdictional
defense
and
it
asked
for
seven
or
eight
extensions
of
time
during
the
course
of
this
litigation.
the
final
thing
i
would
like
to
say
is
that
the
government's
arguments
presuppose
that
there's
no
good
reason
for
relaxing
rules.
but
there
is.
we
realize
that
litigants
and
lawyers
make
mistakes
and
rules
such
as
relation-back
serve
important
purposes
so
that
litigants
and
lawyers
don't
get
tripped
up
by
technical
rules
such
as
the
one
the
court...
the
court
below
and
the
government
is
trying
to
impose
here.
if
the
court
has
no
questions.
