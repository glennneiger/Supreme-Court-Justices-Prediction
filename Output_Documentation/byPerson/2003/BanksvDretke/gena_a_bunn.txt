ms.
gena
a.
bunn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
1983
to
1996,
banks
filed
three
separate
state
habeas
applications
raising
numerous
claims,
but
banks
failed
to
diligently
pursue
his
current
brady
and
strickland
claims
during
these
state
proceedings.
he
elected
instead
to
expend
his
efforts
pursuing
other
claims.
it
wasn't
until
federal
habeas
proceedings
that
he
turned
his
efforts
to
developing
the
instant
claims.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
no,
your
honor,
the
state
never
denied
it.
it
did
fill--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
our
interpretation
of
the
record
that
it
did,
because
this
single
sentence
found
in
a
145-page
petition
was
buried
in
a...
basically
a
laundry
list
of
claims
of
prosecutorial
misconduct,
at
the
end
of
that
section
containing
a
great
number
of
other
allegations,
which
the
state
responded
to
specifically
by
saying,
first
a
number
of
them
had
been
addressed
in
other
sections
of
the
brief,
including
the
swain
claim,
and
another
brady
claim
that
was
fully
developed.
and
then
it
responded
to
the
remaining
claims
by
saying
that
they
were
all
procedural...
procedurally
defaulted
based
on
the
lack
of
a
contemporaneous
objection.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes.
there
was
a
general
denial
at
the
beginning
of
the...
the
state's
answer
to
the
145-page
brief.
however,
the
context--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes,
your
honor,
and
it
does
appear
that--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes.
well,
not
for
information.
he
was
paid
to
assist
police
in
obtaining
the
murder
weapon.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
no,
your
honor.
the
state
never--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--what
the
trial
prosecutor
knew...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
the
trial
prosecutors
actually
knew
about
the
money
that
bank...
that...
that
farr
was
paid
several
months
before
the
trial
in
this
case
by...
by
police
investigators.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
in
the...
in
the
brady
disclosure
context,
certainly
he
is.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
not
that...
not
that
i'm
aware
of
that
the
police
were
at
the...
at...
really
have
testified
in
the
trial.
but
i
believe
the
rule
was
invoked
in
the
trial,
so
he
did
not
sit
in
on...
on
farr's
testimony
or
any
of
the
other
state's
witnesses'
testimony.
but--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--there
is
no
evidence
of
any
inducement
of
that
kind
to
farr
in
this
case,
no
evidence
of
any
kind
of
inducement
whether
financial
or
a
break
in...
in
any
convictions
for
his
testimony,
contingent
upon
his
testimony
in
this
case.
that's
what
distinguishes
it
from
cases
like
bagley
and
giglio.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
but
again,
as
far
as
the
cause
issue
goes,
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
claim
is
procedurally
defaulted
to...
due
to
banks'
failure
to
develop
it
in...
in
the
state
court.
the
dispute
is
whether
he
has
established
cause,
and
the...
the
basis...
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
in
cause
is
the
petitioner's
conduct,
and
in
this
case,
the
state
record
makes
clear
that
banks
was
aware
of
this
claim
and
actually
alleged
the
claim
in
the
petition
itself.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
not
that
it
supersedes
the
obligation
under
brady,
but
it
does
preclude
a
finding
of
cause
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
nondisclosure--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes,
your
honor,
because
in
a
case
like
this,
unlike
strickler,
unlike
amadeo,
this
is
more
like...
more
like
mccleskey,
where
the
nondisclosure,
whether
in
trial
court
or
in
state
habeas,
did
not
prevent
the
petitioner
from
developing
the
claim.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
your
honor,
this
case
does
not
present
a
situation
where
there
is
a
record
developed
on
what
efforts
banks
expended
on
this
case.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
banks'
counsel
pursued
this
claim,
that
they
sent
investigators
out
to
try
to
find
farr.
there's
absolutely
nothing--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--because
they
were
obviously
aware
of
the
claim,
aware
of
the
potential
existence
of
the
claim.
they
requested
no
investigative
assistance
regarding
the
claim.
they
investigated
no
discovery
regarding
the
claim.
they...
while
they...
what
they
did
do
was
expend
what
at
that
point
were
pretty
extensive
resources
pursuing
and
developing
their
swain
claim
and
another
brady
claim.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
at...
in...
in
a
case
like
this
where,
unlike
strickler,
where
the
evidence,
the...
the
nondisclosed
evidence
was
not
in
the
sole
possession
of
the
state.
it
was
discoverable
as...
as
actually
ultimately
have
it
in
habeas,
in...
in
federal
habeas
proceedings.
banks
was
able
to
procure
this
evidence.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
yes,
your
honor--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--that
would
be--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--that
is
part
of
our
position,
that
essentially
the
absence
of
that,
the
absence
of
a
request
for
investigative
assistance,
the
absence
of
any--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--your
honor,
they...
there
was
an
obligation
from
them
to
pursue
the
claim
further,
yes.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
your
honor,
the
first...
first
it
is
not...
that's
not
the
question.
it
is
the
habeas
petitioner's
burden
to
allege
and
prove...
provide
evidentiary
support
for
his
claim.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
that
obligation
is
essentially
triggered
by
materiality,
so
you
have
that
working
as
well.
but
that
does
not...
the...
the
state's
continuing
obligation
does
not
basically
preclude
a
finding
of...
of...
of
no
cause
in
a
case
like
this.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
your
honor,
again,
that...
that
was
not
the...
those
are
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
there's
no
evidence
and...
and
farr
has
not
said
in
post-conviction
that
he
was
paid
for
testimony.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
but
to
find
cause
in
a
case
like
this
would
essentially
be
to
hold
that
a
brady
claim
can
never
be
defaulted
because--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--and
i
want
to
focus
also
on
the...
on
the
record
itself
and
what
banks...
farr
was
never
asked
specifically
whether
he
was
a
police
informant,
so
he
never
denied
that
allegation.
at
the
guilt
innocence
phase,
starting...
it...
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
37...
in
the
middle
of
questioning
by
defense
counsel
at
the
guilt
innocence
phase
about
his
drug...
prior
drug
use
and
his
drug
habit,
he...
farr
was
asked
the
question,
and
have
you
ever
taken
any
money
from
some
police
officers?
and
he
answered
no.
this
was
a
false
statement,
but
not
to
be
construed
as
necessarily
as
a
denial
that
he
was
a
police
informant,
particularly
given
the
context
of
the
questioning.
later
in
the
guilt
innocence,
he
was
asked--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--again,
though,
the...
the
materiality
of
farr's...
of
this
nondisclosure
has
to
be...
there
are
several
factors
that
have
to
be
assessed
in
that...
in
that
issue.
first,
the
fact
that
farr
wasn't
paid
for
his
testimony,
and
the
impeachment
value
of
the
informant
status
itself
is
limited
to
the
mere
fact
that
farr
had
acted
as
a
police
informant
in
this
case
and
had
assisted
police
in
obtaining
the
murder
weapon.
but
that
impeachment
did
not
extend
to
any
inference
that
farr
had
testified
favorably
for
the
state
because
he
had
any
financial
or
any
other
kind
of
incentive
to
do
so.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
but
farr's
subjective
intent
did
not
undermine
banks'
intent,
and
banks
actually
admitted
at
the
punishment
phase--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--the
difference
is,
farr's
testimony
was...
indicated
that
banks
was...
had
the
intent
himself
to
participate
in
the
robberies,
and
banks
limited
that
to
being
willing
essentially
to...
to
abet
farr
in...
in
committing
those
robberies.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
joint
appendix.
that's
the--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--that's
the...
that's
one
instance
that
they...
that...
that's
the
only
one
dealing
with
money.
what
police
officers--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes,
yes,
that's
correct.
and
that...
the
denial
of
that,
of
course,
is...
is
not
fault,
because
there's
nothing
in
subsequent
testimony
to
indicate
that's...
that's
untrue.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes.
that
is
a
false
statement.
however,
it
can...
it's...
it
is
far
afield
to
interpret
that
as
a
denial
of
being
a
police
informant.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
that
is
at
joint
appendix
37.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
in
the
middle
of
the
questioning
about...
about
farr's
prior
drug
use,
defense
counsel
asks,
and...
and
have
you
ever
taken
any
money
from
some
police
officers?
there
is
further--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--further,
he's
asked,
what
police
officers
did
you
talk
to
about
this?
i
have
talked
to
no
one
about
this
outside
of
when
they
called
us
down
referring
to
the
case--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--which
again
is
a
false
test...
is
a
false
statement,
but
does
not
specifically
deny
police
informant
status.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
cook.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
charles
cook.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
certainly,
your
honor.
the
lower
courts
did
not
consider
that
claim
to
be
properly
before
the
court
because
banks
failed
to
present
it
in
his
federal
petition,
failed
to
present
it
in
any
amended
and
supplemental
petition,
and
the...
and
there's
nothing
in
this...
in
this
record
to
indicate...
that
would
support
a
finding
of
implied
consent,
or
the
trial
by
consent.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
that
was
a
basis
of
its
holding,
yes.
that's
correct,
on
debatability.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
no,
your
honor,
it's
not,
and
it--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--the
issue
actually
before
the
fifth
circuit,
the
issue
that
it
resolved,
was
whether...
whether
it
was
debatable...
the
district
court...
whether
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
denying
the
59(e)
motion,
because,
in
fact,
the
district
court
never
considered
15(b)
because
it
was
never
raised
to
the
district
court,
that...
that
particular
argument.
so--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--that
was
part--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes,
your
honor.
that
was
part
of
the
holding.
the
stated--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--i
believe
that
would
be
an
appropriate
course
on
this
issue,
and
in
this...
we
are
not...
we
are
conceding
the
debatability
of
the
general
applicability
of
15(b)
in
the
habeas
context.
what
we
do
not
find
to
be...
what
we
do
not
believe
to
be
debatable
is
the
applicability
in
this
case,
that
essentially
there's
no
factual
predicate
for
the
application
of
15(b)
in
this
case,
given
that
there's...
there's
simply
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
any
party
beside
bank
himself,
including
the
judge...
the
lower
court
judges,
had
any
inkling
that
this
issue
was
properly
before
them.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
the
fifth
circuit,
after...
after
noting
that
what
the
fifth...
that...
that
the
district
court's
findings
regarding
the
failure
to
raise
the
claim,
the
failure
to
raise
it
in
an
amended
petition,
did
hold
that
it
was...
that
it...
that
15(b)
did
not
apply
in
the
habeas
context.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
no,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position
that
essentially
a
prosecutor's
duty
to
disclose
whatever
information
is
triggered
by
the...
the
potential
materiality
of
that
information.
and
particularly
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
informant
is
not...
was
not
paid
for
testimony,
was
not
given
any
sort
of
break
for
his
testimony,
that
there's
no
specific
inference
that
can
be
drawn
regarding
an
incentive
for
testifying
favorably
for
the
state,
that
that
is
not--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--there...
i
know
of
no
such
authority
for
that
particular
proposition,
but
there's
also
nothing...
there's
also
no
opinion
from
this
court
saying
that
a
witness'
informant
status
is
per
se
material,
which
is
essentially
what...
what
that
would--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--well,
your
honor,
again,
even...
even
assuming
a
breach
of
a
federal
rule
of...
state
rule
of
evidence,
that
would
not
implicate
the
constitutional
due
process
concerns
at
issue
here.
and
under
brady--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--but
again,
there's
nothing
in
this
trial
record
to
indicate
that
trial
counsel
specifically
requested
that
information
prior
to
going
to
trial,
that
he...
that
trial
counsel
himself
didn't
pursue--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--well,
there
is
an
obligation
from...
on...
upon
defense
counsel
to
pursue
the
remedies
he's
entitled
to,
and
to...
to
specifically
request
the
informant
status
of
any
witness,
yes,
there
is
an
obligation
in
a
case
such
as
this.
and
the
fact
that
trial
counsel
did
not
do
that,
at
least
precludes
a--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--but
even
assuming
that...
that
violation,
that
is
not...
that
does
not
support
itself
a
finding
of
cause
to
the
procedural
default
of
banks'
failing
to
develop
this
claim
for
years
even
though
knowing
of
its
existence.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor,
and
again,
several
factors--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--several
factors
play
into
that
issue.
again,
just...
just
the
pure
impeachment
value
itself
was...
was
weakened
by
the
fact
that
there
was
no
incentive.
but
also
the
fact
that
farr
was
heavily
impeached
already
and
that
the
informant
status,
weak
as
it
was,
was...
was
really
merely
cumulative.
defense
counsel
had
brought
out,
both
on
direct
and
then
again
on
cross,
his
prior
drug
abuse,
track
marks,
his
denials
during
cross-examination,
refuted
by
the
defense
witnesses,
which
included
a
denial
that
he
acted
as
a
police
informant
in...
in
another
case
for
another
jurisdiction.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
no,
your
honor.
this
is...
this
is
from
defense
counsel.
and
third,
even
without
farr's
testimony,
the
significant
evidence
of
banks'
future
dangerousness.
banks
admitted
at
punishment
that
he
was
willing
to
abet
farr's
commission
of
future
armed
robberies
by
providing
him
with
the
weapon.
in
fact,
he
was
willing
to
drive.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes.
that
is
correct.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
it
is
a
piece
of...
of...
of
the
state's
puzzle,
but
it...
but
given
what
is
left,
not
material.
and
again,
the
fact
that
he
was--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes.
it
would
not
have
put
the
state's
punishment
case
in
such
a
different
light
as
to
undermine
the
verdict.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
it
was
definitely
favorable
evidence
to
the
state's
future
dangerousness
case,
but
it
was
not
all
that
was
there.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
the...
vetrano
jefferson's
testimony,
though
he
did
amend
his
version
of
the
incident
in
post-conviction
proceedings,
he
did
not
recant
his
testimony
that
banks
hit
him
across
the
face
with
a
gun,
but
only
that...
and
not
that
he
had
attacked
banks'
wife,
but
that
he
had...
that
he
had
had
a
verbal
altercation
with
her.
and
there
was
no
physical...
no
physical
threat
whatsoever
that
banks
responded
to
by
hitting
him
across
the
face
with
a
gun,
and
this
happened
a
week
prior
to
the
murder.
and
again,
this
testimony
indicated
that
banks
was
known
to
carry
a
weapon
on
a
regular
basis
in
the
weeks
before
the
murder.
and
the
murder
itself,
the
unprovoked
nature
of
it,
the
fact
that
banks
essentially
lured
a
16-year-old
kid
to
a...
an
abandoned
and
secluded
park
near
his
home
and
shot
him
three
times
to
steal
his
car.
and
then...
and
then
the
fact
that
though...
though
farr's
testimony
was...
was
crucial
on
the
limited
issue
of
banks'
willingness
to
participate
himself
in
the
armed
robberies,
it
still...
still
the
fact
that
banks
had
it...
and
himself
admitted...
admitted
at
punishment
that
he
was
willing
to
abet
farr's
commission
of
murder
and
had,
in
fact,
been
willing
to
drive
what
would
have
been
a
six-hour
round
trip
to
dallas
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
procure
that
weapon
to...
to
aid
those--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
he
did...
he
did
testify
in...
in
response
to
cross-examination
by
the
prosecutor
that
he
was
willing
to
provide
what
could
potentially
be
a
death
weapon
in
a
robbery
case.
and
in
the
light
of
this
future
dangerousness
evidence
that
remains,
as
well
as
the
incremental
impeachment
value
of
farr's
informant
status
within
the
context
of
the
trial,
former's
informant...
farr's
informant
status
wouldn't
have
put
the
state's
case
in
such
a
different
light
as
to
undermine
confidence
in...
in
the
jury's
verdict.
again,
the
state's
duty
to...
to
disclose
in
these
cases
is
triggered
by
the
materiality
of
the
evidence,
and
in
this
case,
farr's
import...
farr's
informant
status
was
not
that
kind
of...
of
evidence.
it
was
not
material
evidence.
unless
there
are
no
further
questions.
thank
you.
