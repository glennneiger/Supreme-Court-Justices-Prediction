justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it...
is
it
your
contention
that
this
is
a
basis
simply
for
setting
aside
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
somewhat
puzzled
by
that,
but
you
have
three
different
claims
to
discuss
here
and
i
don't
want
to
take
too
long.
it...
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
if
it...
if...
if
this
is
the
evidence
at
trial,
that...
that
there's
no
additional
obligation
or
special
obligation
at
sentencing
where
that
becomes
really
a
secondary
matter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
find
that
the...
or...
or
conclude
that
the
defense
counsel
was
not
as
diligent
as
it
ought
to
have
been
on
this
point.
is
that
somehow
excused
by
the
prosecution's
failure
to
present
the
brady
material?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's...
there's
perhaps
a
slight
difference
in
being
misled
and
simply
a...
a
case
in
which
the
prosecution
does
not
come
forward
with
brady
material.
there...
they
may
be
some
distinction
in
the
two.
what
is
the
standard
that
you
would
have
us
apply
in
this
case
to
rule
for
you
with
reference...
if...
if
we
base
that
ruling
on
the
prosecution's
failure?
is
it
just
a
standard
brady?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
there
documents--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--were
there
documents
or
arrest
reports
to
show
farr's
informant
status,
or
was
this
just
a...
a...
a
circumstance
where
the
prosecution
should
have
said
orally
that
this
is
his
status?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
there...
you're
not
complaining
that
documents
weren't
turned
over?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
complaining
that
the...
that...
that
a
statement
was
not
made
by
the
prosecution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
there's
a...
a
number...
you
have
banks
and
i
take
it...
tell...
you
want
to
talk
to
us
about
cooksey
in
the...
in...
in
the
sentencing
phase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how...
how
does
that
work?
when
this
occurs
and...
and
this...
these
questions
are
set
forth
in
footnote
4
of
your
brief...
when
this
occurs,
does
a
brady
obligation
arise
at
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
the...
i'm
the
prosecutor,
i'm
sitting
there,
i
hear
this
guy
say
that
he's
never
talked
to
me
and
i
know
that
he
has
and
i
know
that
i
have
71
or
74
pages
of
notes.
do
i
now
have
a
brady
obligation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
question
is,
is
there
a
brady
obligation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wasn't
it
representative
of
the
police
there
at
the
trial
the
whole
time
to
assist
the
prosecutor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
the
petitioner's
awareness
that
there
is
a...
a
claim
supersede
the
prosecution's
obligation
to
disclose
brady
material,
and
to
disclose
the
fact
that
one
of
its
own
witnesses
lied
on
the
stand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
prosecution
can
lie
and
conceal
and
the
prisoner
still
has
the
burden
to...
to
discover
the
evidence?
that's
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
want
us
to
say
that
the...
that
the
defendant
relies
on
his
peril,
at
his
peril,
on
the
representations
of
the...
of
prosecution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
is
the
question
if...
if
justice
ginsburg
is
right,
that
prosecutors
have
a
continuing
obligation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
i
were
a
defense
counsel,
i
could
think
of
a...
of
a...
no
more
damaging
material
of
cross-examination
in
this
case
than
to
show
farr
was
paid
money
to
come
up
with
the
story.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
cooksey
report
that
the...
i
think
it...
the
cook...
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
witness
cook--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
the...
that
the
report
of
his
interviews
with...
with
the
police
was...
was
very,
very
strong
and
helpful
impeachment
material.
do
you
want
to
comment
on...
on
the
claim
that
relates
to
his
testimony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
it
certainly
goes
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is...
is
entitled
to
rely
on
what
the
prosecution's
course
of
conduct
is
with
reference
to
the
informer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
the
defense
counsel
has
to
say,
now,
will
you
comply
with
all
of
the
rules
that
are
in
the
texas
statutes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
isn't...
this
isn't
what
the
prosecution
told
the
jury,
was
it?
