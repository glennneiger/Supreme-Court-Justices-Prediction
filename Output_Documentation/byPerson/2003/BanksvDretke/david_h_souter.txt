justice
david
h.
souter
as
to
materiality--
--but
he...
i
take
it
you
do
not
agree
that
you
have
to
show
that
the
result
would
have
been
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
specifically
the
misrepresentations
were
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
had
they
also
not
given,
or...
or
before
trial
had
they
not
also
said,
we'll
give
you
everything
in
the
file?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it
was
brady
material?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
may
i
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
you...
you...
you
gave
us
some
examples
of...
of
material
that
was
turned
over
to
you
under
this
policy
in...
in
which
it
was
not
necessary
to
file
a
motion.
was
that
material
turned
over
you
in
response...
to
you
in
response
to
a
specific
request
from
you,
or
did
they
simply
come
up
with
this
and
say,
this
is
the
material
that
you
could
get
if
you
moved
for
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
did
the
general
discovery
motion
refer
specifically
to
what
they
gave
you,
or
was
the
motion
simply,
give
us
everything
we're
entitled
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
that
was
what
they
gave
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
the
problem
that
i'm...
i'm
having
with
this
is,
i
thought
at...
and...
and
i...
i...
i
got
into
this
myself,
i
realize,
but
i
thought
they
had
said,
in
effect,
we'll
give
you
everything
you're
entitled
to.
now
we're
getting
down
to
greater
detail,
and
i
think
the
problem
is
mine,
but
i
want
to
follow
it
through.
they
apparently
said,
you
don't
have
to
file
a
specific
motion.
justice
ginsburg
raises
the
question,
well,
what
did
you
ask
for
even
though
you
didn't
have
to
file
a
specific
motion?
you
say
that
you
filed
a
general
discovery
request
that
specifically
did
ask
for
prior
convictions.
they
gave
you
prior
convictions.
my
concern
is
that
the
understanding
between
counsel
was,
we'll
give
you
what
you
ask
for,
but
we
are
not
volunteering
by
our
representation
to
give
you
anything
you
don't
ask
for.
if
this
is
correct,
then
the
only
reason
you
would
be
entitled
to
this
would
be
an
affirmative
brady
obligation,
whether
you
ask
for
it
or
not.
is
it
the
brady
obligation
or
do
you
think
they
had
undertaken
something
more
extensive
than
brady
required?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
did
they
issue
or
counsel
that
counsel
would
not
have
to
ask
for
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
the
law
requires
us
to
disclose?
justice
david
h.
souter
--and...
and
in
addition--
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they
had
in
effect
at
trial
in
the
jury
argument
vouched
for
his
truth,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
are...
are...
aren't
you
arguing,
just
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
that
what
they
should
have
done
in
this
case
is
to
go
to
the
court
and
say,
we
want
further
resources
to
investigate,
and
what
specifically
we
want
to
investigate
is
an
issue
which,
if
we
are
correct,
the
state
is
affirmatively
lying
about.
we
want
investigative
resources
to
prove
that
state's
counsel
is
lying.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
for
failure
to
do
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--for
failure
to
do
that,
they're
out.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
face
of
the
state's
representation.
in
other
words,
if...
if
they
asked
for
it,
i
assume
the
state
would
have
said,
well,
we've
told
them
that
there
isn't
anything
to
this.
and...
and...
and
you
would...
you're
saying
that
they
should
have
pursued
it
in
the
face
of
that
for
the
purpose,
among
other
things,
of
proving
that
state's
counsel
was
lying
to
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
did...
is...
is
it
correct
that
but
for
farr
there
would
have
been
no
testimony
that
banks
would
participate
in
those
robberies,
and
there
would
have
been
no
testimony
that
banks
and
his
accomplices
would
use
the
gun
to
eliminate
any
trouble
that
might
come
up
during
that.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
pretty
damning
testimony,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
material
because
it
would
not
have,
in
effect,
raised
a
serious
question
about
the...
the
integrity
of
the
result
or
the
fairness
of
the
trial?
