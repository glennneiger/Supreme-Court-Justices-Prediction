justice
stephen
g.

but
your
time...
your...
your
light's
flashing,
and
i...
when
you
come
back,
i'd
appreciate
your
asking...
answering
one
factual
question
i
have
on
this.
in
1996,
you're
in
federal
court
with
five
witnesses
about
farr
being
a...
an
informant.
in
1992,
you
say
you
learned
from
cook
information
that
led
you
to
think
you'd
find
those
witnesses.
in
1992
and
'93,
you
are
in
state
habeas.
why
did
you
not
either
engage
in
that
kind
of
discovery
in
state
habeas
or
find
those
witnesses
for
the
state
habeas
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
didn't
prevent
it
absolutely,
but
it
made
it
pretty
tough,
didn't
it?
i
mean,
the...
sitting
there
in
january,
the
prosecution
has
been
not...
been
denying
nonstop
that
farr
has
been
paid
anything,
they're
beginning
to
get
some
information
maybe
that
isn't
true.
the
prosecution
is
still
denying
it
by
denying
the
allegation,
and
they
think
they're
going
to
have
to
find
somebody
who
will
prove...
who
will
say
that,
and
they
can't
find
farr.
so
what
are...
what
were
they
supposed
to
be
doing?
they
were
looking
for
witnesses.
they
couldn't
find
farr.
the
prosecution
isn't
telling
them
the
truth
apparently.
and
so,
what...
what
is
it
that
they
should
have
done?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
that.
what
i
said
was,
i
was
repeating
what
he
said,
that...
and
when
they
filed
it
in
january...
i
don't
want
to
repeat
it
again,
you
heard
what
he
said
too...
and
he
said
they're
just
learning
from
cook
some
time
in
1992
that
it
might
be
possible
to
get
evidence
that
would
show
what
the
prosecution
was
saying
was
false.
so
i
want
your
opinion.
you
say
it's
quite
clear
that
they
should
have
investigated
this
further.
really?
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
that's
true,
but
i...
i
mean,
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
bothers
me
about
your
position
is,
if
we
were
to
say
that
a
defense
counsel
behaves
unreasonably
when
he
relies
upon
an
explicit
statement
of
the
prosecutor's,
such
as
i
deny
the
allegation,
that's
to
say
that
the
justice
system
lacks
integrity,
and
indeed
it
might
contribute
to
that
lack
of
integrity
to
impose
this
kind
of
obligation
and
thereby
excuse
a
prosecutor
under
circumstances
like
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
it
can.
all
that
it
requires
is
that
a
prosecutor
who
says,
my
files
are
open,
who
says
that
we
do
not,
in
fact,
deny
that
we
paid
money
for
a
related
purpose
to
the
witness,
all
it
requires
is
that
he
be
telling
the
truth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
have
there
as
well
mr.
jefferson,
who
said
that
banks
whacked
him
or
hit
him
hard
and
happened
to
omit
that
he
himself,
mr.
jefferson,
had
attacked
mr.
banks'
sister,
which
could
be
a
reason
why
he
had
hit
him.
