well,
he
testified
that
the
defendant
confessed
to
him
several
times,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
he
charged
with
knowledge
of
what
the
organization
as
a
whole
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
saying
that
because
he
was
paid
to
help
get
the
gun
back
rather
than
to
testify
falsely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
he
was
paid
for
a
critical
role
in
the
scenario
that
led
to
the
indictment,
rather
than
post-indictment
false
testimony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
i
think
it's
even--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
question?
but
isn't
it
even
more
significant
that
his
real
role
in
the...
in
the
whole
story
is
that
he
was
the
person
used
by
the
police
as
an
excuse
to
go
up
and
get
the
gun
back
two
weeks
after
banks
had
left
it
there,
whereas
the
record
left
the
impression
that
banks
himself
wanted
that
gun
to
commit
future
robberies,
without
any
explanation
of
the
fact
that
the...
that
two
weeks
went
by
without
any
such
request?
and
then
when
farr
gets
in
the
picture,
they
go
up
to
get
the
gun,
and
then
farr
says,
because
banks
insisted
on
it,
which
is
not
only
false,
but
improbable
and
terribly
prejudicial
at
the...
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it...
it
was
diametrically
opposed
to
the
notion
that
he
wanted
to
get
the
gun
to
commit
robbery,
as
whereas
the
real
purpose
of
the
whole
venture
is
to
get
the
gun
to
give
to
the
police.
justice
john
paul
stevens
banks'
intent
as
revealed
in
farr's
testimony,
which
is
the
only
evidence
in
supporting
that
theory
that
banks
was
dangerous
for
that
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
there
such
an
obligation
if
the
state
rules
require
it?
this...
we
supposed
to
say
we
want
to
be
sure
you've
complied
with
all
the
state
rules
that
govern
prosecutions?
