justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
record
shows
that
counsel
for
banks
and
banks
thought
farr
was
an
informant
back
in
1980?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
there
was
a
suspicion
of
that
back
in
'80?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
then
16
years
went
by.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
this
wasn't
evidence
that
was
under
lock
and
key.
there
were
witnesses.
they
just
weren't
easily
available.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
maybe
there
had
to
be
a
request,
not
litigation,
but
say,
tell
me,
was
he
an
informant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
tell
me.
did
you
every
ask
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
please
answer
that
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
ever
ask
the
prosecution
whether
farr
was
an
informant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
when
was
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
is
a
bit
of
an
aside,
but
do
you
know
whether
any
disciplinary
proceedings
were
ever
brought
against
the
prosecutors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
wait
a
minute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in...
in...
in
the
state
habeas
proceeding,
the
state
submitted
a
response
to
the
petitioner's
petition
and
denied
all
the
allegations
in
the
petition,
which
included
the
assertion
that
farr
was
a
paid
informant
and
that
the
state
had
withheld
that
information
from
banks.
the
state
denied
that,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
that
the
case
that...
do
you
now
concede
that
farr
was
paid
something
for
his
information--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--by
the
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
and
did
the
state
prosecutor
ever
disclose
that
during
the
trial,
even
though
he
said,
no,
everything's
perfectly
truthful
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
assume
we
have
to
take
this
case
on
the...
the
premise
that
the
state
somehow
knew
that
the
state
had
paid
the
money
to
farr,
and
i
guess
also
had
promised
some
kind
of
a
break
not
making
certain
criminal
charges?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
don't...
didn't
you
have
a
defendant
here
without
a
prior
criminal
record,
and...
and
the
state
is
trying
to
prove
future
dangerousness
and
that
this
is
a
really
bad
actor.
i
would
have
thought
that
went
rather
to
the
heart
of
the
sentencing
question.
