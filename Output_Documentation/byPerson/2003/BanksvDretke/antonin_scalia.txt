justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but...
but
you...
you
have
the
burden,
don't
you,
to
show
that
the
outcome
would
have
been...
would
have
been
different
had
the...
had
the
state
come
clean
at
the
beginning?
and
as
i
understand
it,
you...
you
assert
that...
that
he
would
not...
a
jury
would
not
have
judged
him
as
harshly
if
the
jury
had
known
that
he
was
going
to
get
the
gun
in
order
that
farr
could
commit
robberies
with...
with
apparently
his
assistance,
rather
than
what
farr
had
told
them,
namely
that
he
had
gotten
the
gun
in
order
that
he
would
commit
future
robberies,
right?
and
you
think
that
would
have
made
the
difference,
whether
he's
getting
the
gun
to
let
somebody
else
kill
or
getting
the
gun
to
kill
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
understand.
but...
but...
but
you're
saying
he
admitted
that...
that
he
got
the
gun
so
that
farr
could
commit
robberies,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
have...
would
have...
would
have
tapped
a
wellspring
of
mercy
in
the...
in
the
jury's
breast?
i...
i
don't
really
see
how
it
would
make
that
much
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
recanted
what
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
banks
admitted
that
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what...
what
was...
what
was
the
gun
going
to
be
obtained
for?
self-defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
people
were
being--
justice
antonin
scalia
--threatened
by
somebody?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that...
that
explains--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
farr
got
it.
it
doesn't
explain
why
banks
got
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
to
show
cause
and
prejudice,
and
i
thought
that
under
strickler,
the...
the
necessity
of
showing
prejudice
requires
that
you
show
that
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
sentence
would
have
been
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
don't
think
you
have
an
obligation
to
show
reasonable
probability--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
sentence
would
have
been
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
acknowledge
that
you
have
to
do
that
or?
justice
antonin
scalia
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
material.
i...
i
would
take
that
to
mean
documents
that
we
have
that
you're
entitled
to,
and
we
don't
know
that
there
are
any
documents
reflecting...
reflecting
farr's
informer
status,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
respond
falsely.
he
just
didn't
respond.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
failure
to
respond
is
a
no,
rather
than...
than
a
yes?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
as
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
that...
that's
the
most
shocking
thing.
do...
do
we
know
that...
that
counsel
who
allowed
farr
to
lie
on
the
stand,
and
indeed
went
on
to
argue
to
the
jury
about
farr's
testimony,
do
we
know
that
counsel
knew
that
that
was
a
lie?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you...
well,
you
can
argue
it
was
his
responsibility,
you
know,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
it
was
his
responsibility.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
did
cook
testify
to
that
was...
that
was
essential
to
the...
to
the
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
you're...
you're...
you're
not
asking
for
the
guilt
to
be...
to
be
overturned.
you're
asking
for
the
sentence
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
asking
for
reversal
of
the
conviction
on
the
basis
of
cook?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
what...
now,
what...
what
was
essential
to
the
conviction
that...
that
he
testified
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
what
do
you
say
the
state
withheld
with
regard
to
cook?
that
it
had
gone
over
his
testimony
in...
in
advance?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
on
its
face
incredible
anyway.
you
think
the
jury
believed
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
think
the
prosecutors
can
just
put
him
on
without
even
asking
him
what
he
was
going
to
testify
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
parents
had
testified
in
the...
and
i
think
he
even
said
that
they
were
good
parents,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and...
and
the
fact
that
they
were
these
horrible
parents
were...
was
going
to
be
testified
to
by
a
dr.
pina,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
came
out
of
whose
mouth?
justice
antonin
scalia
who--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
did...
what
did
she
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
she
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
a
skin...
a
skin
problem--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
think
that
would
have
altered
the
jury's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right.
what...
what...
i...
let...
what...
what
is
all
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
she
testified
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
she
testify
about
being
tied
to
a
tree?
justice
antonin
scalia
did...
did
mrs.
banks
provide
the
testimony
about
his
being
a
tied
to
a
tree
and
whipped?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
provided
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
banks
provided
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
terribly
credible
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i'm...
i'm
just
concerned
whether
it
would
make
any
difference.
one...
once
again,
your
burden
is
to
show
that
would
have
made
a
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
skin
problems
and
an
alcoholic
father,
you
know,
who...
who
on
the
basis
of
banks'
mother's
testimony
terrorized
the
child
and
banks'
testimony
that
he
was
tied
to
a
tree
and
whipped.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
this
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
jury
would
have
thought
that
this
explains
his...
his...
his
cold-blooded
murder
of...
of
the
victim
for
his
car?
justice
antonin
scalia
did...
did
the
state
deny
in
one
of
these
habeas
applications,
deny
that
farr
was
an
informant?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
better
be
careful
what
you
deny,
don't
you
think?
i
mean,
each
and
every
would
include
that,
even
if
it's
buried
in,
you
know,
if
it's
buried
in
a
lot
of
other
stuff.
i
mean,
you
could
have
said,
you
know,
everything's
so
buried
we
can't
tell
what's
what,
but
you
didn't
say
that.
you
said,
we
deny
each
and
every.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
knew...
he
knew
that
farr
was
testifying
falsely
and
he...
he
let
that
testimony
go,
and
indeed
relied
on
it
in
his
summation
to
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
page
of
the
transcript
that
you...
you
cited
page
37.
is
that
in
the
joint
appendix?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
the...
that
is
the
confession
of...
i'm
sorry...
that...
that
is
the
perjury...
that's
the
only
perjury
that's
supposedly--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
course,
this
doesn't...
this
doesn't
deal
with
whether
he
has...
was
a
police
informer.
it...
it
deals
with
whether
the
police
officers
promised
you
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where...
where
is
that?
have
you
ever
taken
any
money
from
police
officers?
justice
antonin
scalia
thirty,
thirty-seven,
my
god,
reading...
oh,
i
got
it,
i
got
it,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
we
got
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
said,
i
mean,
the...
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
think
that
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
15(b)
applies
in
habeas,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
that
absolutely
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it's
not
absolutely
clear,
then...
then
it
seems
to
me
they
should
have...
they
should
have
granted
the...
the
certificate
of
appealability.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
wasn't
the
basis
that
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on.
i
thought
it
relied
on
the
basis
that
there's
huge...
there's
just
no
question
that
15(b)
doesn't
apply
in
habeas.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
a
lot
of
question
about
that,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe
we
should
remand
at...
at
least
on
the,
you
know,
on
the...
on
the
cook
claim
to
have
the...
the
fifth
circuit
decide
whether
a
coa...
decide
the
15(b)
question
and
then
decide
the
cook
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
bunn,
do
you
have
any
argument
that
this
might
not
have
made
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
suggest
you
might
train
your
guns
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
admit
that...
that
he
was
willing
to
abet
murder.
he
just
admitted
he
was
willing
to
get
the
gun
for
robberies.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
say
specifically,
in
order
that
somebody
can
be
killed?
he
didn't
say--
