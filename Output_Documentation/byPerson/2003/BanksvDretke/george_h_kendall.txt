mr.
george
h.
kendall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
three
issues,
two
arising
from
purposeful
and
recurring
misconduct
by
the
trial
prosecutors,
and
a
third
from
constitutionally
deficient
defense
counsel.
prior
to
trial,
the
prosecutors
promised
to
disclose
discoverable
material
to
the
defense.
they
knew
that
robert
farr
would
testify
as
a
key
witness
at
each
phase
of
trial,
and
they
knew
that
he
was
an
informant
and
had
been
paid
for
his
services.
mr.
farr
did
in
fact
take
the
stand
at
both
phases
of
this
trial.
he
denied
he
was
an
informant.
he
denied
he
received
any
consideration
for
his
work.
he
denied
tipping
off
the
authorities
that
mr.
banks
would
be
taking
a
trip
to
dallas.
he
denied
setting
up
mr.
banks
for
arrest.
the
prosecutors
knew
that
when
mr.
farr
gave
his
testimony
it
was
not
truthful.
they
did
not
rise
to
their
feet
and
ask
mr.
farr
to
correct
this
testimony.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
we
have
asked
this
court
to
affirm
the
district
court,
who...
who
did
grant
relief
on
death
sentence.
we're
not
asking
for
relief
on
guilt
innocence
on...
on
the
mr.
farr
claim.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
your
honor,
the
reason
why
we
take
that
position
is
that
his
testimony
at
the
punishment
phase
is
absolutely
critical
for
the
state
to
get
the
death
penalty
in
this
case.
the
district
court
recognized
that.
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
said
that
that
testimony
was
crucial.
what
he
told
the
jury
was
that
mr.
banks
had
returned
to
dallas
to
get
a
gun
so
that
mr.
banks
could
on
the
return
trip
commit
armed
robberies
and
take
care
of
and
eliminate
witnesses.
there
was
no
other
testimony
that
came
close
to
matching
that
at
the
punishment
phase,
and
the
state
had
the
burden
to
establish
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
mr.
banks
would
be
a
danger
in
the
future.
if
they
didn't
satisfy
that--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--your
honor,
mr.
banks
denied
at
trial
that
he
had
any
intent
to
commit
any
crime
whatsoever
with
regard
to
this
robbery.
and
mr.
farr
had
made
it
clear--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--we
think
there's
a
world
of--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--no,
your
honor.
the
point
is...
is
that
the...
the
state
could
not
ask
the
jury
to
impose
the
death
sentence
unless
it
first
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
mr....
there
was
a
strong
likelihood
that
mr.
banks
would
commit
acts
of
violence
in
the
future.
we
think
there's
a
clear
difference,
and
the
trial
prosecutors
recognized
this,
between
mr.
banks
going
to
get
a
gun
so
that
mr.
banks
could
rob
and
kill,
as
opposed
to
providing
instrumentality.
but
more
importantly,
your
honor,
mr.
farr
recanted
that
testimony
at
the
federal
hearing
and
that
recantation
was
found
credible
by
the
district
court.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
no
one
had
the
intent
to
rob
anybody.
that
was
a
ruse
that
mr.
farr
used--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--no.
mr.
banks
admitted
on
the
stand
that
he
had
finally
agreed
to
accompany
mr.
farr
to
dallas
to
get
a
gun.
but
mr.
farr
denied...
mr.
banks
denied
that
he
had
any
intent
whatsoever
to
commit
any
crime,
and
he
flatly
denied
that
assertion.
mr.
farr...
this
was
a
ruse
that
mr.--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--it
was--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--it
was
a
ruse--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--justice
scalia,
it
was
a
ruse
that
mr.
farr
used
that
was
not
true--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--to--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--but
that
was
not
the
theory
that
the
case...
that
the
prosecutors
asked
the
jury
to
conclude
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
mr.
farr
would...
that
mr.
banks
would
be
dangerous
in
the
future.
the
district
court
granted
relief
on
that
and
we
think
that
clearly
we
have
shown
materiality
on
that
point.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
we...
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
this
court
has
not
retired
the
alcorta
and
napue
standard,
and...
and
it
shouldn't
use
this
case.
the...
the
standard
in
alcorta
and
napue
that
says
if
the
government
puts
up
perjured
testimony,
that
if
there's
a
possibility
that
that
testimony
affected
the
judgment
or
if
the
judgment
is
reversed.
we
do
acknowledge
that
this
court
in
brecht
did
provide
a
rule
generally
for
habeas
corpus
that
is
different
from
that
rule.
but
it
said
in
footnote
9
of
that
decision
that
where
there
are
cases
where
there
was
a
pattern
of
misconduct,
that
the
brecht
rule
might
not
apply.
there
is
clearly
a
pattern
of
misconduct
by
the
government
in
this
case.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
your
honor,
we've
not--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--we
do.
we
do,
and...
and--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--we
do,
your
honor,
and
the
district
court--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--on...
on
cause,
we
do,
your
honor,
and
we...
we...
we've
met
that
clearly.
so
it's
our
submission
here
that
mr.
farr's
testimony
was
critical--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--it
was
a
habeas
case,
your
honor,
but
the
court
has
not
distinguished
between--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
court,
since
brecht,
in...
in
subsequent
cases,
in...
in
kyles
and
in
strickler,
has
continued
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
there's
this
category
of
misconduct
that
has
always
been
treated
differently,
and
we
do
not
see
why
it
shouldn't
be
applied
here.
however,
we
believe
that,
given
the
importance
of
farr
in
this
case
to
the
state's
case
that
we
meet
the
reasonable
probability
standard,
or
whatever
the...
other
standard
the
court
would
impose
on
us.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--there
was
repeated
effort
by
trial
counsel
to
answer
that
question.
at
a
pre-trial
hearing,
counsel
specifically
asked
the
chief
investigator,
who's
your
informant?
and
the
investigator
said,
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you.
when
mr.
farr
was
on
the
stand,
both
at
the
guilt
phase
and
at
the
sentencing
phase,
counsel
asked,
are
you
working
for
the
state,
are
you
an
informant?
mr.
george
h.
kendall
and
i
think
after
trial,
given
the--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--yes,
your
honor,
because
there
were--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--your...
your
honor,
there
was...
it
was
very
difficult
for
us
to
obtain
this
proof.
we...
we
had
every
right
to
belief
the...
given
the
fact
that
the
prosecutors
had
said,
mr.
farr
has
been
truthful
with
you
in
every
way,
that
whoever
the
informant
was
in
this
case,
it
was
not
robert
farr.
we
only
began
to
think
differently
about
this
when
we
finally
got
access
to
another
of
the
critical
state
witnesses,
charles
cook,
who
told
us
in
1992
that
some
of
his
testimony
was
not
truthful.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
your
honor,
we
think
that
we
acted
reasonably
and
diligently
in
post-conviction.
we
were
misled
by
the
state,
and
in
fact,
we
used
that
state
habeas...
we
filed
in...
in...
in
1992
the
claim
on
information
belief
farr
was
an
informant
in
this
case.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
that
would
be
under
strickler.
our
view
is
that
because
of
the
misrepresentations
in
this
case,
we
were...
we
were
allowed
to
rely
on
those
misrepresentations.
we
wanted
to
litigate
farr's
informant
status
in
the
state
habeas
proceedings,
but
we
couldn't
get
the
evidence
to
prove
that.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
were
that
farr
had...
had...
had
denied
that
he
was
a
paid
informant.
he
was
a
paid
informant,
and
the
prosecutors
in
their
closing
arguments
told
the
jury
that
he
had
been
completely--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--truthful
in
every
way
with
you.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
they
said,
you
don't
have
to
file
a
discovery
motion,
we
will
disclose
to
you
material
that
is
discoverable,
and
this
clearly
was
discoverable
material--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--when
they
put
him
on
the
witness--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--he--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--he
filed
a
standard
discovery
motion,
but
the...
the
government
long
before
that
said,
you
don't
have
to
file
a
motion,
we'll
provide
material
that's
discoverable
to
you.
and
there's
no
argument...
the...
the
state
has
tried
to
say
that
it,
even
by
calling
an
informant,
it
does
not
have
to
reveal--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--that
status.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
it...
the
prosecution
revealed
prior
convictions
on
its
witnesses.
it
did
not
disclose
mr.
farr's
informant
status
or
arrangement.
it
did
not
disclose
with
regard
to
charles
cook.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
when
we
finally
obtained
what
was
represented
to
us
to
be
the
full
prosecution
file
in
this
case,
there
was
not
one
notation
in
there
with
regard
to
mr.
farr,
identifying
him
as
an
informant.
they
were
obliged
to--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--that's
correct.
they--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--that...
that
we
believe
the
law
required
them,
once
they
decided
to
put
this
informant
on
the
stand,
to
disclose
that
factor
to
the
defense.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
because
it
was
brady
material.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
it
was
turned
over
after
a
general
discovery
motion
was
filed,
but
that
discovery
motion
was
never
taken
up
at
a
hearing.
this
was
disclosed--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--it...
i
believe
it
said
give
us
prior
convictions.
and--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--and
that's
all
that
they
provided,
that's
correct.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
i
think
that
they
assured
counsel
that
whether
it
was...
whether
they
had
to
disclose
something
under
state
law
or
under
brady,
that
there
was
no
need
for
litigation.
they
would
provide
brady
material--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--the
letter...
the
letter
says,
you
do
not
have
to
file
a
motion,
we'll
provide
you
with
material
that
the
law
requires
us
to
disclose--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
but,
your
honor,
it
said
in
lieu
of
a
motion,
and
so
i
think
it
was
fair
for
counsel
to
include
that
there
needed
to
be
no
litigation
about
discovery--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--that
the
government
understood
what
state
law
and
federal
law
required.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
well,
your
honor--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--i
think
after
these
assurances,
i
think
counsel--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
at
trial,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
where
the
prosecution
was
specifically
asked.
it's
state
habeas.
we
pled
a...
a
claim
on
information
belief
that
he
was
a
paid
informant.
that
required
the
government
lawyer
who
was...
who
was
one
of
the
trial
prosecutors
to
respond,
we
believed,
truthfully.
he
did
not
respond
to
that,
and
that--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--that
was
in
state
post-conviction
proceedings,
and
the...
and
he
has
was
required
to
respond
truthfully
to
that,
and
under
state
law
that--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--but
under
state
law
that
is
a
no,
that
is
a
denial.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
but
he--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--any...
any
factual
allegation
of
petition
that
is
not
addressed
specifically
in
the
answer
is
treated
as--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--a
denial.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
well,
it's
clear
that
when
you
read
their
answer
that
the
state
had
denied
our
allegation
that
mr.
farr
was
a
paid
informant
in
this
case.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
on...
on
both
at
the
guilt
innocence
phase
and
at
the
punishment
phase.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
your
honor,
there
aren't--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--mr.
elliott
gave
an
affidavit
in
state
post-conviction
that
said
that
he
was
aware
of
all
the
facts
pursuant
to
the
investigation
and
the
presentation
of
evidence
in
this
case.
i
would
think
that,
given
farr's
important
status
in
this
case,
there's
no
doubt
that
he
knew.
at
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing,
he
did
not
in
any
way
try
to
say
that
he
did
not
know
that
farr's...
was...
had
this
informant
status
until
much
later
at
the
trial.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
there
have
been
absolutely
no
disciplinary
proceedings
whatsoever.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
let...
let
me...
we...
let
me
go
to
the
cook
claim
if
i
could.
there
was
another
very
troubling
due
process
claim
raised
in
this
case,
and
that
was
at
the
key
guilt
phase
witness.
mr.
cook
had
testified
pursuant
to
a
deal
and
that
the
state
had
withheld
impeachment
material
on
him.
three
months
before
the
evidentiary
in
the
hearing
in
this
case,
we
received
for
the
first
time
a
lengthy
pre-trial
statement
that
had
all
kinds
of
impeachment
material
in
that
and
that
showed
beyond
any
doubt
that
mr.
cook
had
lied
in
his
testimony
before
the
jury
that
he
had
not
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
rehearsed
his
testimony
with
the
state.
from
the
time
of
that
disclosure
until
the
evidentiary
hearing,
it
was
clear
that
this
transcript
would
serve
as
evidence
for
us
to
prove
up
our
claim
that
the
state
had
suppressed
material,
impeachment
material,
on
mr.
cook.
and
mr.
elliott,
the
trial
prosecutor--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--this
was
the...
the
key
guilt
phase
witness,
your
honor.
he
was
the...
the
entire
narrative
of
the
crime
in
the--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--with
regard
to
the...
mr.
farr,
we're
asking
only
for
sentence
relief.
with
regard
to
cook,
we're
saying
he
was
the
crucial
guilt
phase
witness.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
he...
he
provided...
he
had
to...
the...
the
prosecutor
in
his
opening
statement
told
the
jury,
mr.
cook
is
our
critical
witness,
you
have
to
believe
him
for
us
to
win
this
case.
he
said
that
over
and
over
again.
cook
presented
the
confession--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--he...
he
was
the
only
person
who
provided
information
that
mr.
banks
had
confessed.
he
was
the
only
person
that
tied
mr.
cook
to...
mr.
banks
to
any
other
evidence
in
this
case.
the
trial
prosecutor
portrayed
him
accurately.
he
was
the
critical
witness
for
the
government
at
the...
at
the
guilt
phase
of
trial.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
well,
what
he
was
asked,
the
first
question
on
cross-examination
was,
who
have
you
talked
to
about
your
testimony?
he
said
nobody.
he
said,
you
haven't
talked
to
any
about
this
case?
i
haven't
spoken
to
anybody.
that
was
a
bald-faced
lie.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
well,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--well,
they
certainly
would...
they
certainly
would
have
believed
that
if
the
government
would
have
disclosed
this
transcript
that
showed
that
three
days
before
trial
mr.
cook
had
a
very
difficult
time
keeping
his
narrative
about
this
crime
straight.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--your
honor,
for
decades
the
court
has
said
that
when
a
government
witness
lies,
the
government
attorney
has
the
obligation
to
correct
that.
the
brady
obligation
continues,
it's
pre-trial
and
it's
during
trial.
it
can
arise
during
trial
depending
on...
on
what
the
government
witness
says,
and
it's
clear
that
after
cook
gave
that
answer,
that
the
government
was
obligated,
one,
to
have
him
correct
his
testimony,
but
certainly
not,
after
he'd
given
that
testimony,
to
get
up
in
front
of
the
jury
and
say,
mr.
cook
was
completely
truthful.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
there
is
a
brady
obligation,
absolutely.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
no,
no,
no,
because
it...
it
was
clear
that
what
the
defense
was
trying
to
show
was
that
mr.
cook
should
not
be
believed
because
he's
really
been
worked
over
by
the
prosecutors
to
get
his
story
together.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
transcript
that
wasn't
disclosed
demonstrated.
he
was
mocked
during
this
pre-trial
statement
by
the
prosecutors
who
were
preparing
him
because
he
was
making
so
many
mistakes
and
getting
things
all
out
of
order.
they
didn't
believe
he
was
a
credible
witness
three
or
four
days
before
trial,
and
the
only
reason
that
he
was,
or
might
have
appeared
credible,
was
because
of
this
session.
this
was
classic
impeachment
material.
the
government
had
this
in
their
briefcase
at
trial.
they...
they
disclosed
the...
the
brief
statement
that
mr.
cook
had
given
four
minutes
before
but
not
this
one.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
unfortunately,
justice
ginsburg,
we
did
not
lose
on
it.
the
district
court
did
not
adjudicate
that
claim.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
because
we...
efforts
were
made,
we
could
not
find
farr.
but
we...
efforts
were
made,
and
we
could
not
find
farr,
but
we
went
right
to
the
horse's
mouth.
james
elliott,
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
knew
that
he
was
a
paid
informant.
when
we
raised
that
claim
in
our
petition,
he
had
an
obligation
then
to...
to
tell
us
honestly
was
he
an
informant
or
was
he
not,
and
he
did
not
do
so.
we
wanted
to
litigate
his
status,
farr's
status
in
the
state
court.
we
were
prevented
from
doing
so
because
of
the
lack
of
candor
and
the
lack
of
discovery
from
the
prosecutor.
he
could
have
made
this
very
simple
and
said,
yes
he's
the
guy,
let's
litigate
this
in
state
court.
he
didn't
do
so.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
ineffective
assistance
claim.
the
district
court
granted
relief
on
that
claim
after
hearing
information
that
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
is
relevant
to
the
capital
sentencing
process.
the
fifth
circuit
overturned
that
grant
of
relief
by
making
a...
two
legal
mistakes.
first,
unlike
the
district
court,
and...
and
not
following
the
decisions
from
this
court,
the...
the
court
vulcanized
its
review
of
our
mitigating
evidence
instead
of
looking
at
it
in
its
entirety
and
weight
that
against
the
aggravation.
it
broke
this
evidence
up
into
three
categories
and
said,
looking
at
each
one,
weighing
these
on
the
scale,
the
panel
found
no
reasonable
likelihood
of
a
different
result.
that
is
clear--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--there
was
mental
health
evidence.
there
was
testimony
about
mr.
vetrano
jefferson
recanting
his
testimony
that...
about
who
was
the...
who
had
been
the
aggressor
in
a
fight
before
this
crime,
and
then
the
testimony
offered
by
the
parents
in
this
case.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
all...
all
going
to
sentence,
your
honor.
this
was--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--this
was
only
about
sentence,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
your
honor--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--your
honor,
there
was
no
claim
that
these
were
horrible
parents.
they
were
loving
parents,
but
they
was
a
very
troubled
family
that
mr.
banks--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--grew
up
in,
and
it's...
there
was
evidence
that
came
out
that
was
plainly
relevant
to
the
sentencing
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
it
came
out
of
mrs.
banks'
mouth
as
a--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--mrs.
banks,
the
mother--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--in
the
state
habeas
proceedings.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
she
said
that,
for
example,
her
son
had
been
subjected
to
all
kinds
of
problems
because
of
his
very
serious
dermalogical
ailment
that
he
had
from
birth
all
through
his
life.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
a
very
serious--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--well,
that
was
one
piece
of
the...
of
the
court--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--that
her...
her
husband
unfortunately
had
been
an...
a
alcoholic
and...
and
for
years
when
he
became
drunk
would
terrorize
her,
terrorize
the
children.
she
often
had
to
take
the
children
and
leave
the
house
to
assure
her
safety
and
mr.
bank's
safety
and
his
siblings'
safety.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
she...
she
proffered
that
in
state
court,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
then
the
experts,
mr.
cunningham
in
federal
court,
testified
about
what
all
this
does
to
an
individual
in
the
formative
years
of
life.
this
is--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--it...
it--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--it
was...
it
was
mrs.
banks'
testimony
that
there
had
been
repeated
instances
where,
to
avoid
harm,
they
had
to
leave
the
home.
in...
there
were
some
problems
that--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--did--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--no,
she
did
not.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
mr.
banks
provided
that.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
yes.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
well,
your
honor,
the
state
has
never...
in
state
court
they
did
not
attempt
to
show
that
any
of
this
proffer
was
inaccurate
or
not
true.
their
position
in
state
court
was
simply
that
the
trial
lawyer
had
done
a
good
job,
and
so
we'd
failed
to
show
prong
one
of
strickland.
in
the
federal
court--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--and
the...
and--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--your--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--well,
your
honor,
the...
the
testimony
here
was
that
these
were
very
serious--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--things
that
plagued
mr.
banks'
life--
mr.
george
h.
kendall
--well,
your
honor,
it
might
not
fully
explain
it,
but
it
would
say
that
he's
not
the
type
of
offender
for
whom
the
death
penalty
needs
to
be
carried
out
against.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
h.
kendall
thank
you,
your
honor.
very
briefly,
on
the
charles
cook
claim,
i...
ms.
bunn
has
conceded
that
jurors
of
reason
would
find
debatable
the
rule
15
issue.
we
would
ask
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
that,
that
we
not
go
back
just
to
the
fifth
circuit,
that
the
case
be
sent
back
to
the
court
in
texarkana,
the
district
court,
for
fact-finding
on
the
underlying
claim.
there's
not
been
any
fact-finding
whatsoever
on
that
claim,
and
we
think
that
would
be,
if
the
case
is
going
back
to
the
fifth
circuit,
that
that
would
be
entirely
useful.
thank
you
very
much.
