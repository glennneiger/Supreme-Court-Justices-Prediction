the

what
did...
what...
what
did
he
ask

what
did

ask

did...
did--
justice

--did...
did
the
defendant
get
anything
after
the

said,
you
don't
have
to
file
any
formal
motion,
we'll
give
you
everything
you're

justice

--it

more
than
that
though,
wasn't
it?
it...
they...
in...
in
fact,
the
state
put
it
in
a
general
denial.
it
denied
each
and
every
allegation
of
the
complaint,
including
the
allegation
that
farr
was
an
informer.
justice

but
you
lost
on

point

there
was
one
specific
incident
of
the

tying
the

him.
were
there
any
other
specific

when

when

became

justice

ms.
bunn,
did
not
the
state
say,
we
deny
each
and
every
factual
allegation
in
this
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wasn't
there
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
having
deceived
the
jury
and
the
court,
to
come
clean?
why
is
the
burden
on
the
defendant,
who
was
subjected
to
false
testimony?
why
is...
and
the
prosecutor
knows
it...
why
isn't
it
the
prosecutor's
burden
to
come
clean
at
any
stage,
rather
than
let
this
falsehood
remain
in
this
record?
i
just
don't
understand
why
it
becomes
the
defendant's
burden
when
the
prosecutor
is
best
situated
to
have
the
information,
was
this
true
or
not,
did
we
pay
this
informant
or
not.
why
isn't
that
a
continuing
obligation
on
any
lawyer
who
makes
a
representation
that's
false
to
a
court?
justice
ruth
bader

have
you
ever
taken
any
money
from
some
police
officers?
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
three
lines
down
from
the
top.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
one
petition
you
took
in
your
brief
and
you
said
that...
that
the
state
is
not
obliged
to
reveal
the
identify
of
an
informer.
that's
not
correct,
is
it,
if
the
informer
is
called
as
a
witness?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
authority...
what
authority
do
you
have?
what
case
holds
that
when
the
government
puts
an
informant
on
the
stand,
it
does
not
have
to
divulge
that
capacity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there...
isn't
there
a
texas
rule
of
evidence
that
says,
this
is
508(c)(1)
of
the
texas
rules,
an
informer's
identity
must
be
disclosed
if
he
appears
as
a
witness
for
the
public
entity?
justice
ruth
bader

in
a
texas
trial
court,
the
petitioner
delma
banks,
jr.,
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
prosecutor
during
pretrial
proceedings
told
defense
counsel
that
the
state
would
provide
all
the
discovery
to
which
banks
was
entitled
despite
that
understanding,
the
state
withheld
evidence
that
would
have
allowed
banks
to
discredit
two
key
prosecution
witnesses
by
showing
their
links
to
the
police.
one
of
the
two
witnesses,
robert
farr,
testified
at
both
the
guilt
and
penalty
phases
of
banks’
trial.
the
state
did
not
disclose
to
banks
that
farr
was
a
paid
police
informant
who
had
played
a
key
role
in
the
scenario
leading
to
banks’
indictment.
the
prosecutor
allowed
farr
to
testify
untruthfully
and
without
correction
that
he
never
spoke
to
any
police
officer
about
banks’
case
until
a
few
days
before
trial.
presenting
the
state’s
penalty
phase
summation,
the
prosecution
urged
the
jury
to
believe
farr
calling
his
testimony
open
and
honest,
and
of
the
utmost
significance
to
the
state’s
plea
for
a
capital
sentence.
the
other
key
witness,
charles
cook,
testified
only
at
the
guilt
phase.
cook
had
been
coached
intensively
by
prosecutors
and
law
enforcement
officers
in
preparation
for
his
testimony.
the
transcript
of
a
police-cook
interrogation
revealed
the
coaching,
but
the
prosecutor
did
not
tell
the
defense
that
the
transcript
existed.
to
direct
appeal
and
state
postconviction
review
proceedings,
the
state
left
undisclosed
the
police
links
to
prosecution
witnesses
farr
and
cook.
when
banks
alleged
an
state
court
habeas
petition
that
farr
was
an
informant,
the
state
denied
it.
the
long
suppressed
evidence
ultimately
came
to
light
through
discovery
and
an
evidentiary
hearing
ordered
in
a
federal
habeas
proceeding,
the
federal
district
court
granted
banks
relief
from
the
death
penalty
pointing
to
the
state’s
failure
to
disclose
that
witness
farr
was
a
paid
police
informant.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
that
determination.
banks
did
not
qualify
for
federal
relief
from
the
death
penalty,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled,
because
he
had
not
documented
his
claims
of
prosecutorial
misconduct
in
state
court
and
was
therefore
barred
from
introducing
evidence
of
the
state
office’s
misconduct
in
federal
court.
the
fifth
circuit
also
denied
banks’
certificate
of
appealability
on
his
claims
that
the
prosecution
had
wrongfully
withheld
from
the
defense
the
transcript
of
the
pretrial
rehearsal
of
witness
cook.
we
reverse
both
fifth
circuit’s
rulings.
when
police
or
prosecutors
conceal
significant,
exculpatory,
or
impeaching
material,
we
hold,
it
is
ordinarily
incumbent
on
the
state
to
set
the
record
straight.
as
to
witness
farr’s
informant
status,
it
was
banks’
burden
to
show
cause
and
prejudice
to
overcome
his
counsel's
failure
to
produce
evidence
of
police
links
to
farr
in
state
court
proceedings.
banks
succeeded
in
demonstrating
the
requisite
cause.
he
reasonably
relied
on
the
state’s
representations
made
pretrial
and
repeated
in
state
habeas
proceedings
that
the
prosecution
had
disclosed
all
relevant
information.
we
reject
the
state’s
contention
that
banks
nevertheless
should
have
attempted
to
unearth
the
truth.
a
rule
declaring
prosecutor
may
hide
defendant
must
seek,
is
not
tenable
in
a
system
constitutionally
bound
to
accord
a
defendant’s
due
process.
as
to
prejudice,
banks
demonstrated
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
result
in
the
penalty
phase
of
the
case
had
the
jury
known
a
prosecution
witness
farr's,
collaboration
with
the
police.
showing
cause
and
prejudice
to
overcome
his
procedural
default,
today’s
opinion
explains
banks
at
the
same
time
established
the
essential
element
of
his
claim,
the
prosecutorial
misconduct
infected
the
death
penalty
adjudication.
we
also
reverse
the
fifth
circuit’s
ruling
on
banks’
claim
of
guilt
phase
prosecutorial
misconduct.
a
claim
that
rested
on
the
state’s
suppression
of
the
transcript
showing
that
witness
cook
had
been
coached.
the
court
of
appeals,
we
hold,
should
have
issued
the
certificate
of
appealability
on
the
question
whether
banks
should
be
deemed
to
have
pleaded
the
cook
transcript
claim
given
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
15(b)’s
provision
for
amendment
of
a
party’s
pleading
to
conform
to
the
proof.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
scalia
joined.
