justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what
would...
what
would
land
management
have
done
in
1940?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
is
it
if
it's
not
valuable?
i
mean,
that...
that's
the
problem.
if
it
wasn't
valuable
at
the
time
of
patenting,
what
do
you
do
with
it?
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
if
your
argument
is
going
to
be
consistent,
you're
going
to
say
the...
the
government
hasn't
reserved
the
right
to
uranium.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
changing
the
hypothesis.
justice
scalia's
question
was,
if
it
wasn't
valuable
at
the
time
of
the
patent,
but
we
have
now
discovered
uses
for
it
so
that
it
is
valuable,
what
do
you
do
with
uranium?
and
i
would
have
thought
that
your
position
would
be
the
government
loses
on
uranium
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
an...
an
argument
that
hasn't
specifically
come
up
this
morning?
and,
first,
i
just
want
to
tell
you
what
my...
my
understanding
of
the
argument
is
and...
and
you
tell
me
if
i've
got
it
wrong.
i
thought
one
of
your
arguments
was
that
it
was
important
to
know
whether
the
mineral
was
valuable
or
not
at
the
time
of
the
patent
or
the
deed
because
the...
the
grantee,
the
patentee,
ought
to
know,
in
effect,
the
extent
to
which
his...
his
land
grant
is...
is
jeopardized
by
the
government's
right
to
come
in.
he
ought
to
be
able
make
a
rough
judgment
as
to
whether
at
some
point
they're
going
to
come
in
and
start
extracting
things.
is...
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
david
h.
souter
my...
my
question
is
this.
if...
if
that
is
the
reason
for
saying
we
should
look
to
value
at
the
time
of
the
patent,
isn't
that
an
argument
that
is
at
odds
with
your
position
that
if
the
mineral
is
valuable
at
the
time,
it
is
reserved?
because...
the
reason
i
say
that
is
this.
there
may
be
gold
under
the
land,
but
the
patentee
doesn't
know
it
and
the
government
doesn't
know
it.
so
that
there
is
no
way,
at
the
time
the
deed
passes,
that
the
person
taking
that
deed
is
going
to
be
able
to
know
whether,
at
some
point
in
the
future,
the
government
is
going
to
come
in
and...
and
start
drilling
a
mining
shaft
in
the
land.
so
my
question
is,
regardless
of
what
the
date
at...
at
which
value
is
established,
isn't
it
the
case
that
these
patentees
never
really
know
whether
at
some
future
time
the
government
is
going
to
come
in
and
start
drilling?
and
if
that
is
so,
why
should
the
patent
date
be
important?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
are
you
saying
basically,
look,
that's
the
way
we've
done
it
and
you
ought
to
defer
to
the
practice?
is
that...
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
that
the
foundation
for
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
it
makes
up
the
bulk
of
the
land?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
that
you
would
have
an
argument
maybe
for...
for
limiting
what
the
government
can
take
if
out
of
your,
whatever
it
is,
600
acres,
you
know,
590
are
gravel
and
the
government
says,
too
bad,
we're
taking
it
all.
but
as
i
understand
it,
we...
we
have
not
gotten
any
issue
in
this
case
or
in
other
cases
about
an
inequitable
enforcement
of
the...
of
the
extraction
condition.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you'd
have
an
argument
on
the
first
prong
of
western
nuclear
if
they
took
that
position
in
fact,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that...
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the...
with
the
purpose
of
the
grant
in
the
first
place
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
extent
of
it.
does...
does
the
record
indicate
that
the...
that
the...
that
you
have
claimed
that...
that
one
basis
for...
that
you
should
win
this
case
is
that
the
government,
in
effect,
will
take,
as
you
put
it,
the
bulk
of
the
property
if
they
win?
is...
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
did
this
court
disapprove
of
a
portion
that
justice
ginsburg
just
referred
to?
i
don't
remember.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
it
say
it
was
wrong?
did
it
say
that
was
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
test,
as
i
understand
it,
would
be
whether
it
was
commercially
worthwhile
to
extract
it
and
transport
it
to
wherever
you'd
have
to
take
it
to
use
it.
