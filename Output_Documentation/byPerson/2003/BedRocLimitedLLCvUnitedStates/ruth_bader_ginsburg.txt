justice
ruth
bader

mr.
mccrum,
you
left
out
one
word
in
the
mining
law.
it
didn't
say
valuable
minerals.
it
said,
valuable
mineral
deposits,
and
there's
a
significant
difference
between...
a
lump
of
silver
might
be
tremendously
valuable,
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
deposit
if
that's
all
there
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
couldn't
it
be
that
the...
the
word
valuable
doesn't
mean
at
the
time
of
the
patent?
it
means
reserves
the
mineral
rights,
and
if
and
when
they
prove
valuable,
the
government
will
assert
its
right.
i
mean,
one
could
imagine
a
metal
that
was
not
considered
worth
anything.
let's
just
suppose
that
was
the
view
of
uranium.
and
then
years
later,
one
realizes
the
tremendous
value
of
that
metal.
would
one
say
that,
well,
because
when
the
patent
was
granted,
no
one
had
any
idea
how
valuable
this
would
be,
therefore
when
it
turns
out
that
it
is
indeed
very
valuable,
the
united
states
hasn't
any
reserved
rights?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
we
have
a
case
that
involved,
was
it
methane,
that
was
thought
not
only
did
it
have
no
value,
but
it
was
a
positive
detriment
to
have
it?
and
then
years
later
it
turned
out
to
be
something
very
valuable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
who
had
the
reserve?
didn't
somebody
have
reserved
rights
in
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when...
when
you
say
today
about...
and
you
cite
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
from
1956,
but
the
position
that
the
government
is
arguing
today
in
this
court
is
not
new.
this
is
hardly
the
first
time
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
sand
and
gravel
can
be
valuable
minerals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may...
may
i
just
interrupt
to
ask?
i
thought
that
you...
we
weren't
going
to
talk
about
dirt
because
dirt
is
part
animal,
part
vegetable,
so
it's
not
mineral.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
do
you
explain
the
1956
solicitor
letter...
opinion...
the
doi
solicitor
who
said
that...
that
there's
a
reservation
only
if
the
gravel
had
a
definite
economic
value
because
of
the
proximity
of
a
market
at
the
date
of
the
patent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's...
there's
another...
there's
another
piece
from
the
department
of
the
interior
that
mr.
mccrum
emphasized
in
addition
to
the
1956
opinion
letter,
and
it
was
a
heading
or
a
sentence
in
the
western
nuclear
brief,
in
the
sg's
brief,
stating
that
the
reservation
embraces
only
gravel
deposits
that
are
economically
exploitable
and
would
justify
an
entry
under
the
1872
mining
act.
so
in
western
nuclear,
according
to
mr.
mccrum,
that
issue
wasn't
before
the
court
and
the
government
said,
indeed,
the
issue
is
it
has
to
be
economically
exploitable
at
the
time
of
the
patent.
