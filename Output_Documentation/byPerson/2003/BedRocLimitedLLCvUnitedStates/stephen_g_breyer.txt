what
would
happen,
though,
if
you...
what...
would
any
bad
thing
happen
if
the
words
were
interpreted
to
mean
any
mineral
at
all
that
ever
becomes
valuable
in
the
future
so
that
then
a
person
who
bought
this
land
could
never
take
anything
off
of
it?
the
government
would
have
the
right
to
all
the
dirt.
anything
that
he...
anything
that
the
individual
sold,
he
couldn't
sell.
it
would
be
the
government
that
would
have
to
sell
it.
now,
if
you
took
that
interpretation,
what
would
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
must
have
come
up
under...
under...
it
has
nothing
to
do
with...
i
don't
think,
with
the
word
valuable.
it
has
to
do
with
the
word
minerals
covered
in
leases
all
over
the
country.
so
it
must
have
come
up
in
this
other
context
too.
western
nuclear,
putting
that
aside,
that
somebody
looks
at
titanium
or
some...
something.
maybe
it's
never
come
up,
but
i
would
think
it
would
be
true
of
every
mineral
lease,
that...
that
you
have
some
kind
of
a
mineral
that
had
no
value
in
1500
or
1919
and
today
it's
fabulous.
and...
and
does...
are
they...
do
they
cover
them
or
don't
they
cover
them?
maybe
you
don't
know.
i
don't
know,
but
i
don't
see
that
the
word
value
has
much
to
do
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
everything
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
the
government
get...
i
mean,
it
gets
everything.
i
mean,
what...
what
is
it...
i
mean,
you...
mud
is
made
into
adobe
bricks.
i
mean,
and...
so
it
gets
absolutely
everything
except
for
the
6
inches
or
so
that
maybe
was
mixed
up
that
you
could
grow
corn
in.
and
i
don't
even
understand
why
they
wouldn't
get
that
too
if
they
wanted
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
in
thinking
the
government
gets
absolutely
everything
with
the
possible
exception
because
of
the
fourth
point
of
western
nuclear
that
i'm
not
sure
why
it
even
came
in,
but
that
if
it's
mixed
with
something
you
could
grow
something
in,
then
they
don't
get
it.
but
everything
else
is
the
government's.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
and
then...
if
it's
so,
then
at
this
time
what
this
amounted
to
what
seemed
to
be
giving
the
land
away...
it
amounted
to
a
lease
or
a
right
to
use
a
piece
of
land
to
grow
crops.
and
that's
all
these
great
giveaways
were.
they
were
simply
a
right
to
use
land
to
grow
crops
and
nothing
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
that
whole
argument
would
be
that's
certainly
a
possible
reading
of
the
lease.
that's
certainly
a
possible
way
to
look
at
it,
but
it
would
have
come
as
a
great
surprise
to
senator
pittman
and
everybody
else
at
the
time
in
the
interior
department
and
elsewhere.
that's
why,
to
make
their
argument,
they
say
that
western
nuclear
was
certainly
wrong
and
therefore
what
we
should
do
is
limit
it
by
turning
everything
on
the
word
valuable.
that
i
think
is
their
whole
argument
and
you
don't
want
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
the
whole
problem
because
they
say
a
person
who
went
out
to
nevada
and
invested
his
time
in
this
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
weren't
going
to
find
copper.
but
if
you
had
told
him
that
the
government
might
come
in
and
take
all
the
dirt
out
and
take
all
the
gravel
out
and
take
all
the
sand
out,
he
would
have
said
this
is
ridiculous.
i'm
not
going
to
go
out
there
and
invest
my
time
to...
to
graze
a
cow
when
the
government
can
come
along
and
build
a
copper
mine
not
for
copper
but
for
dirt.
i
mean,
really.
so
that's...
that's
why
he
says
they've
made
this
historical
distinction
between
something
that
has
intrinsic
value,
a
precious
metal
then
or
now,
uranium
or
gold,
and
something
that's
widespread
and
commonly
found,
dirt,
copper...
dirt
or
gravel
or
sand.
and
when
you're
in
that
second
category,
i'm
sorry,
you
just
can't
dig
these...
these
great
big
holes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
granite--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
granite...
i
mean,
i'm
thinking
of
granite.
on
our...
we
have
some
granite.
somebody
can
come
in
and
dig
up
all
the
granite?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so...
so
can
i...
can
you
deal
with
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--problem
that's
in
the
back
of
my
mind?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
wanted
to
finish
what
you
were
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
what's
bothering
me
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
assuming
all
the
opinion
letters
and
everything
are
sort
of
a
wash,
is
that
we
don't
ranch
all...
as
much
as
we
used
to
and
we
don't
farm
as
much
as
we
used
to.
and
therefore,
what's
really
at
stake
is
the
ability
to
transfer
title.
and
once
i
begin
to
think
in
that
way,
i
think
that
whoever
might
want
to
sell
or
buy
some
of
this
land,
which
now
might
be
used
for
a
city
or
a
town
or
who
knows
what,
might
think
to
himself,
well,
i
can
deal
with
the
reservation
of,
let's
say,
a
specific
precious
mineral
right
like
gold
or
even
tungsten
or
even
uranium.
but
if
there's
a
possibility
here
that
the
government
can
come
in
and
start
digging,
because
the
mixture
of
organic
only
goes
down
about
6
inches,
and
if
everything
below
that
6
inches
potentially
belongs
to
the
government,
and
the
government
can
come
in
and
tear
up
even
that
6
inches
to
look
for
rocks
or
look
for
sand
or
look
for
gravel
or
granite
or
all
that
stuff,
which
is
undoubtedly
there,
i
just
don't
know
what
i'm
getting
into.
and
therefore,
i
would
be
pretty
reluctant
to
buy
this
piece
of
land,
or
at
least
not
for
much
of
a
price.
now,
it's
that
kind
of
uncertainty
in
land
transfer
title
that
is
coming
on
100
years
after
the
event
that's
worrying
me.
so
i
would
like
you
to
reply
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
that.
