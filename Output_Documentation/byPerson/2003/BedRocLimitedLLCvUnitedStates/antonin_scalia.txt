justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
interior
department
took
that
position.
how?
was
that
a...
a
solicitor's
opinion
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
but
you're...
you're
in
that
boat
too.
i
mean,
you...
you
acknowledge
that
if
the
sand
and
gravel
was
valuable
at
the
time
the
patent
was
issued,
the
government
would...
would
own
it
under
the
mineral
reservation.
so,
i
mean,
despite
the
fact
that
you'd
have
to
chew
up
the
surface
land
to...
to
get
at
it
with
a
commercial
value.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it
wouldn't
be
considered
a
valuable...
i
mean,
that...
that
does
bring
you
into...
into
contradiction
of
our
prior
cases
because
if
that...
if
that
were
so,
it
wouldn't
have
been
considered
a
mineral
either,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccrum,
i
don't
understand
what
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
is
under
your
fall-back
position.
that
is
to
say,
what
do
you
do
with
uranium
which
was
not
regarded
as
a
valuable
mineral
when
the
patent
was
issued
and
nowadays
is
regarded
as
a
very
valuable
mineral?
what
happens
to
uranium
under
your
fall-back
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
is
now.
it
wasn't
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
was
rare
but
not
valuable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you...
you
could
say
uranium
only
has...
only...
has
no
intrinsic
value.
it
only
has
value
if
you're
splitting
atoms.
i
mean,
you
can
make
the
same...
the
same
argument
about
uranium.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
mineral
in
1500.
i
mean,
nobody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--nobody
disputes
that
it
was
a
mineral,
which
is
what
the...
what
the
mining
act
says.
the...
the
issue
is
whether
it's
a
valuable
mineral.
in
your
fall-back
position,
you're
placing
a
lot
of
weight
on
the
adjective
valuable,
and
that...
that
creates
problem
with...
with
uranium.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
dirt
is
valuable
on
that
basis.
i
mean,
people
buy
topsoil.
and,
you
know,
if
you're
in
an
area
where...
where
a
lot
of
people
need
topsoil,
i
suppose
you'd
say
dirt
is
valuable.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
is
it
the
same
with
gold?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
he
uses
the
gold
in
his
house,
it's
okay?
justice
scalia
or
his
teeth.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
his
teeth,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what...
what
are
his
surface
rights?
can...
can
the...
can
the
government
do
whatever
it
takes
in
order
to
get
at
these
minerals?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he...
he
supposedly
has
surface
rights.
don't...
don't
they
have
to
preserve
his
surface
rights
when
they
do
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
can
just
go...
go
in
and
rip
up
the
whole...
the
whole
acreage
in
order
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
clay?
is...
is
clay
like
dirt
or
is
clay
like
sand?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
get
something
clear
about
the...
the
department
of
interior's
position.
you
said
that
ever
since
1872
they
had
taken
the
position
that
sand
and
gravel
was...
was
mineral.
but
isn't
it
the
case
that
they
had
taken
that
position
only
with
respect
to
sand
and
gravel
that
was
removable
in...
in
commercial
quantities?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
all
sand
and
gravel
was
minerals.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that
just...
that
just
proves
that
sand
and
gravel
in
certain
places
is
valuable.
that's
conceded
by
the
other
side.
right?
the
issue
was
that...
is
whether
sand
in
the
gobi
desert
is...
is
something
that's
worth
anything.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
interior
department
never
took
the
position
that
all
sand
and
gravel
is...
is
minerals
under
the
mineral
act
until
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
was
the
first
time
it
came
up
with
the
notion
that
whether
it's
commercially
extractable
or
not
at...
you
know,
at
a
profit,
it
is
all
minerals
under...
under
the
mineral
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
locate
it
if
it
was
commercially
valuable,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
question
i
asked.
when
is
it
that
the
department
first
came
up
with
the
position
that
all
sand
and
gravel,
no
matter
where
it
is,
is
covered
by
the
mining
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
after...
is
it
after
1940?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
talking
for
the
moment
about
what
the
court
adopted.
we're
talking
about
what
the
interior
department
adopted.
what
is
there
in
the
interior
department
that
would
have
contradicted
its
solicitor's
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
find...
if
they
find
water.
they
have
to
come
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
expend
a
certain
amount
of
money--
justice
antonin
scalia
--considerable
money
sometimes,
to
find
water.
and
if
they
find
it,
then
they
have
the
right
to...
to
farm.
and,
you
know,
i
don't
think
that's
a...
such
a
terrific
deal
if
they
can
be
just
dug
out
of
their...
of
their
homestead
by
the
government.
justice
scalia
if...
if
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
i
mean,
the...
the
bureau
has
always
had
a...
a
doctrine
of
inherently
valuable
minerals,
gold
and
silver.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
it
can
be
extracted
at
a
commercial
profit.
and
benthamite
or
kryptonite,
which
superman
uses--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever
you
want,
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
that
that
is
an
inherently
valuable
mineral.
