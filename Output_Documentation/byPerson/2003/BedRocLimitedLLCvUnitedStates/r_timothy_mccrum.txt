mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
began
in
1993
when
the
bureau
of
land
management
issued
notices
of
trespass
for
the
extraction
of
common
sand
and
gravel
from
private
land
in
the
nevada
desert
about
60
miles
from
las
vegas.
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether,
under
the
1919
pittman
act,
the
reservation
of
valuable
minerals
included
common
sand
and
gravel
that
were...
that
were
widespread
and
made
up
the
bulk
of
the
land.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
pittman
act
was
to
develop
the
state
of
nevada
by
granting
private
land
to
citizens
who
made
personal
sacrifices
to
discover
and
develop
underground
sources
of
water
that
was
not...
that
were
not
previously
known.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes,
your
honor.
now,
mabel
and
newton
butler
in
this
case
explored
and
found
a...
a
source
of
underground
water
and
obtained
a
land
patent
from
the
united
states
government
in
1940.
as
we've
explained
in
the
briefs,
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
valuable
minerals,
as
used
in
the
1919
pittman
act,
did
not
include
the
sand
and
gravel
at
issue
here
because
these
common
earthen
materials
in
the
nevada
desert
were
not
included
in
the
contemporaneous
legal
understanding
of
the
term
mineral
when
the
act
was
passed
in
1919
and
these
materials
did
not
have
intrinsic
value
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
act
in
1990...
1919
and
at
the
time
of
the
patent
granting
in
1940.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes,
justice
kennedy.
that's...
that's
the
approximate
size
at
the
time
blm
conducted
its
report
in
1999
or
so.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
we
have
photographs
of
the
site
in
the
joint
appendix
of
the
case
that
show
the
area
of
the...
of
the
land
in
the
general
vicinity
to
be
essentially
the
same.
it's
common.
sand
and
gravel
is...
is
pretty
much
covering
that
whole
general
area.
now,
the
pittman
act's
structure
reserved
valuable
minerals
to
the
government
in
section
8,
and
at
the
same
time
it
did
that,
it
provided
that
those
reserved
valuable
minerals
would
be
subject
to
location
and
development
by
others.
at
that
time,
the...
the
expectation
of
how
this...
how
these
materials
would
be
developed,
whatever
was
reserved
as
valuable
minerals,
was
under
the
1872
mining
law
which
itself
applied
to
valuable
minerals.
so
those
were--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--1919,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
that...
in...
in
the
act
itself,
it
provided
for
location
to
occur
of
the
reserved
valuable
mineral
estate
under
the
1872
mining
law.
so,
therefore,
it's...
it's
quite
important
to
look--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--your
honor
is...
is
correct
that
valuable
mineral
deposits
is
the...
is
the
language
referred
to
in...
in
30
u.s.c.,
section
22
of
the
1872
mining
law.
30
u.s.c.,
section
21
actually
refers
to
valuable
mineral
lands.
and
those
terms
were
really
viewed
as
quite
similar
by
the
interior
department
at
the
time,
and
the
question
was
whether
a
particular
type
of
mineral
was...
was
within
the
class
of
minerals
that
the
1872
mining
law
was
subject
to.
and
in
1919,
if
an
individual
sought
to
establish
a
mining
claim
for
common
sand
and
gravel,
claiming
a
discovery
of
valuable
minerals
in
1919,
it
is
quite
clear
and
certain
how
the
interior
department
would
have
addressed
that
in
1919.
interior
would
have
quickly
denied
the
patent
and
rejected
the
application
of
the
1872
mining
law
to
common
sand
and
gravel.
now,
we
know
that
because
we
can
look
to
the
published
interior
department
decisions
of
the
day
which
were
published
at
that
time,
as
they
are
now,
available
for
citizens,
as
well
as
the
congress
to...
to
look
at.
and
the
repeated
decisions
from
1901,
in
particular,
through
1919
made
it
very
clear
that
common
earthen
materials,
such
as
clay,
sand
and
gravel,
used
for
road
base,
cement-making
purposes,
things
of
that
nature,
were
simply
not
subject
to
the...
the
mining
law.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
in...
by
1940,
the...
the
interior
department
had
modified
its
view
in
1929
and
there
said
that...
that
sand
and
gravel
could
be
subject
to
the
mining
law
if
valuable
on
a
site-specific
basis.
and
under
that
modified
view,
adopted
by
interior
in
1929
in
the
layman
v.
ellis
decision,
it
confirmed
the
importance
of
assessing
the
marketability
on
a
site-specific
basis.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
at...
well,
the
layman
decision
involved
a...
a
question
of
whether
it
was
valuable
at
the
time
of
the
patent
in
that
case,
which
was
a
mining
law
patent
being
considered.
and
then
in
1956,
the
interior
department,
looking
at
the...
at
the
position
that
layman
v.
ellis
took,
applied
that
in
the
context
of
a
mineral
reservation,
as
we
have
here,
and
said
in
the
context
of
a
mineral
reservation,
if
it's
to
include
these...
these
common
materials,
it
can
only
include
those
materials
when
there
is
value
at
the
time
of
the
patent.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
in
a
solicitor's
opinion
in
1956.
it's
a
solicitor's
opinion
which
this
court
took
note
of
in
the
western
nuclear
decision
in
1983
and...
and
relied
on.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
justice
o'connor,
the
western
nuclear
decision
did
hold
that
gravel
could
be
reserved
under
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
of
1916,
but
importantly,
the
issue
of
whether
that
sand
and
gravel
had
to
be
valuable
at
the
time
of
the
patent
was
not
addressed
in
the
holding
of
the
court,
as
the
government
has
acknowledged
in
its
brief.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
it...
it
could
well
have
been...
that...
that
could
have
been
part
of
the
court's
thinking.
in...
in
the
pittman
act,
we
do
have
an
emphasis
on
the
term,
valuable
minerals,
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
certainly
that
is
a
further
reason
why
the
element
of
value
is
all
the
more
important
in
this
case,
both
at
the
time
of
enactment
in
1919,
as
well
as
at...
at
the
1940
patent.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
well,
your
honor,
that...
that
could
be
a
possible
construction,
but
in
this
case
the
interior
department
in
the
1956
solicitor's
opinion
took
note
of
the
common
nature
of
sand
and
gravel
and
how
widespread
it
is
across
the
western
public
domain
and
recognized
that
there
was
a
need
to
look
at...
at
value
on
a
site-specific
marketability
basis,
which
was
actually
consistent
with
the...
the
approach
the
department
took
in
the
layman
v.
ellis
decision
in...
in
1929,
looking
at
the
site-specific
marketability
of
sand
and
gravel,
because
unlike
a
precious
metal
like
gold
which,
once
you
extract
it,
it
can
be
sold
on
an
international
market
without
regard
to
transportation
costs
and
has
intrinsic
value,
sand
and
gravel
and...
and
similar
materials
are...
are
common
and
widespread
across
the
western
public
domain
and,
in
fact,
across
the
country.
and
it
is
only
where
you
have
a
market
on
a
site-specific
basis
that
you
can
have
value
established.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
justice
breyer,
if...
if
you
took
that
interpretation,
you
would
have
western
landowners
essentially
being...
having
a
very,
very
limited
surface...
surface
estate
interest
that
would
essentially
be
at
the
discretion
of
the
government
where
when
local...
local
demands
for
these
materials
arose,
the
government
at
any
time
could
come
in
and
assert
that
they
have
ownership
of
these
widespread
common
materials
which
would
actually
destroy...
potentially
destroy
the
value
of
the
land
and...
and
further,
eliminate
any
private
incentives
to
develop
the
private
land,
which
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
1919.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes,
justice
kennedy.
we
are
not
advocating
such
a
rule,
although
it
certainly
in
this
case
bears...
is
certainly
a
significant
factor
that
this
common,
widespread
material
actually
would
essentially
destroy
the
surface
of
the
land.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
well--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--yes.
justice
kennedy,
it's
just
that
type
of
factor
that
have
caused
the
vast
majority
of
state
and
federal
court
decisions
that
have
addressed
the
question
of
whether
gravel
is
a
reserved
mineral
in
any
type
of
private
conveyance
in
cases
involving
the
government
where
they
acquire
a
surface
interest
that
have
caused
these...
the
federal
and
state
torts
to
rule
almost
uniformly
that
gravel
is
not
a...
a
reserved
mineral
in
the
absence
of
some
express
intent
to
indicate
that
it
should
be
reserved.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
well,
justice
scalia,
we...
we...
so,
i
mean,
we
have
two
positions
here
and...
and
one
is
that
sand
and
gravel
was...
was
not
reasonably
within
the...
the
meaning
of
this
phrase
as
it
was...
was
used
in
1919
considering
the
common
legal
understanding
which
had...
had
been
developed
by
the
interior
department
quite
clearly
between
1901
and
1919
that
made
it
very
clear
that...
that
common,
widespread
sand
and
gravel
was
not
what
the...
was
not
what
was
considered
to
be
a
valuable
mineral
at
that
time.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
we...
we...
in
this
case
we
do
have
the
further
express
language
of...
of
valuable.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes,
justice
o'connor.
if...
if
the
western
nuclear
precedent
is
followed
and
applied
to
the
1919
pittman
act,
then
our...
our
primary
position
is
that
the
material
was
not
valuable
at
the
time
of
patent.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
in...
in
section
8
of
the
pittman
act,
it...
the
statute
makes
it
quite
clear
that
only
valuable
minerals
are
reserved.
and
then
it...
in...
in
later
parts
of
that
section,
it
refers
to,
and
the
mineral
so
reserved
shall
be
disposed
in
accordance
with
law.
i
don't
think
that
changes
the...
the
meaning
of
the
reservation,
and
it's
further
confirmed
here
by
the
actual
patent
issued
by
the
interior
department
in
the
joint
appendix
where
only
valuable
minerals
are
reserved
in
the
patent.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
not
as
a
reservation
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor,
but
it
is...
is,
of
course,
quite
similar
to
the
language
used
in
the
1872
mining
law
which
described
what...
what...
how...
what
would
be
done
with
the
reserved
mineral
estate.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
well,
as
we...
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
justice
kennedy,
the
amount
of
land
that
is
potentially
subject
to
contract
issued
by
the
government
for
gravel
on
reserved
mineral
estates
appears
to
be
on
the
order
of
less
than
two-tenths
of
1
percent
of
the
lands
patented
under
the
stock-raising
homestead
act.
so
the
vast
majority
of
private
lands
at
stake
would...
would
not
be
affected
by
a
ruling
except
to
the
extent
that
it
would
confirm
that
the
landowner
has
the
common
sand
and
gravel
that...
that
was
part
of
the
land
conveyed.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the...
the
pittman
act
itself
applies
solely
in
nevada
and
regardless
of
whether
the
court
were
to
reconsider
western
nuclear,
we
think
that
western
nuclear
should
certainly
not
be
extended
to
this
act
which
has
the
term,
valuable
minerals,
express
in
the
statute
and
where
the
time
of
patenting
issue
was
not
addressed
by
western
nuclear,
as
the
government
acknowledges.
there's
no
issue
of
stare
decisis
if...
if
the
court
is
to
say
the
time
of
patent
paramount,
as
the
interior
department
itself
has
held
in
the
1956
solicitor's
opinion
and
as
the
tenth
circuit
ruled
in
the
hess
case
only
last
fall.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes,
justice
scalia.
uranium
is
clearly
a
rare,
valuable
mineral.
whether
or
not
it
was--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--yes.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes,
and...
and
therefore,
it
is...
it
is
clearly
within
the
class
of
minerals
that
the...
that
the
1872
mining
law
applied.
it
has--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--justice
souter,
the...
uranium
is
clearly
of
a...
a
valuable,
rare
nature.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
of
course,
the
court
may...
may
view
it
that
way,
justice
souter.
the...
the
way
i
would
view
it
is
that
uranium
is
a
rare,
valuable
mineral,
similar
to
gold,
silver,
lead,
and
zinc,
and
it's
very
different--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
thank
you.
that...
that
is...
that
is
precisely
the
distinction.
[laughter]
that
is
precisely
the
distinction.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
but
uranium
is...
is
not
dependent
upon
local
transportation
costs
in
the
way
that
sand
and
gravel
was,
and
that
is
the
fundamental
distinction--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--the...
the
way
that
it
has
come
up
is...
would
be
in
the...
the
most
analogous
way
that
i
can
think
of
is
in
the
context
of
the
1872
mining
law
where,
although
that
language
was
enacted
in
1872,
the
interior
department
has
had
no
trouble
with
the
administration
of
that
law
determining
that...
that
uranium
is
subject
to
location
as
a
mining
claim
under
the
1872--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
have
been
the
amoco
v.
southern
ute
case
in
1999.
there
the
question
is...
was
whether
under
the
contemporaneous
understanding
in
1909
and
1910
did
coal
include
coal
bed
methane.
the
court
looked
to
that
common
understanding
and
common
meaning
and
said,
no,
it
didn't.
and
that's
precisely
the
same
approach
we're
asking
the
court
to
follow
here.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes.
the...
the
government
had
initially
reserved
coal
and...
and
the
question
was
whether
that
pure
coal
reservation
extended
to
the
coal
bed
methane
within
the
coal,
and
the...
and
the
court
concluded
no.
so
it...
it
is...
it
is
a
case
that
we
rely
on
to
look
to
the
contemporaneous
interpretation
and
understanding
at
the
time.
and
here,
sand
and
gravel
was
well
known.
it
was
widespread,
and
there
were
repeated
interior
department
decisions
that
said
this
is
not
the
type
of
mineral
that
is
subject
to
the
1872
mining
law
as
a...
as
a
valuable
mineral.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes,
justice
souter.
correct.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
justice
souter,
you're...
you're
correct
that
there
is...
there's
always
some
level
of
uncertainty
when
a
party
takes
land
subject
to
a
mineral
reservation.
but
the
distinction
that
is
important
that
the
interior
department
has
long
recognized
and...
and
that
the
federal
and
state
courts
have
recognized
is
that
in
the
case
of
a
common,
widespread
material
such
as
gravel,
it
is...
it
is
the
value
at
the
time
of
patent
which
needs
to
be
looked
to.
and
that's
what--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--we
are...
we
are--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--we
are
saying
that
this
is
the
way
the
interior
department
itself
has
done
it,
and
this...
and
this
is
the
interior
department
that
here
is
asserting
a
different
rule
today.
and
the
interior
department
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
recognized
a
distinction
between
common
material
such
as
sand
and
gravel
and
precious
metals
and
other
materials
that
have
intrinsic
value
and
recognized
a
distinction
to
look
to
marketability
and
local,
site-specific
factors.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
position...
the
litigation
position
which
the
government
is
taking
here
today
that
value
does
not
matter
at
the
time
of
patenting
actually
has...
is
not
supported
by
interior
department
decisions.
we
are
relying
on
the
1956
solicitor's
opinion.
this
court
referred
approvingly
to
the
opinion
in...
in
western
nuclear.
that
opinion
has
never
been
overruled
by
the
interior
department
and
the...
and
the
interior
department
offers
no
other
interpretation
of...
on
that
issue
as...
as
something
that
this
court
should
rely
on.
a
further
reason
that
we
think
that...
that
these
issues
should
be
resolved
in
a...
in
a
fair
manner
is
the
application
of
the
leo
sheep
precedent
of
this
court
which
recognizes
the
sacrifice
and...
and...
that
have
been
made
by
the
private
individuals
in
obtaining
these
patents
and
the
inducement
that
the
government
carried
out
in
encouraging
parties
to
make
these
sacrifices
to
obtain
these
lands.
and
the
purpose
of
the
act
would
be
defeated
to...
if...
if
the
government
is
able
to
later
reserve
common
sand
and
gravel.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
justice
stevens,
they
made
sacrifices
to
get
the
land,
and
the
sand
and
gravel
makes
up
the
bulk
of
the
land.
and
if
the
government
can
later
come
back
and
say,
that
sand
and
gravel
is
ours
now
that
it
has
acquired
some
economic
worth,
it
really
defeats
the
purpose
of
putting
the
lands
into...
into
private
ownership.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
justice
souter,
the
government's
position
is
that
they
own
all
the
common
sand
and
gravel
that
makes
up
this
entire
parcel
of
land.
as...
as
much
as
the
extraction
operations
may
continue,
the
government
would
continue
to
take
the
view
that
they
own
every
bit
of
it
based
upon
the
decision
of
the...
of
the
ninth
circuit
below.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
well--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--we
do...
we
do
believe
that...
that
we...
that
the
government's
position
is...
is
contrary
to
western
nuclear
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not...
that
it...
that
it
is
relying
on
the
value
of
the
sand
and
gravel
today
without
regard
to
what
the
value
was
in--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--what
is
in
the
record
is
that...
is
that
this
sand
and
gravel
deposit
is
extracted
from
the
surface,
that
the...
that
the
character
of
the
land
is
widespread,
abundant
common
sand
and
gravel.
the...
the
photographs
in
the
record
show
that
the
land
is
of
the
same
character.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
they
own
the
sand
and
gravel
wherever
it
may
be
on
that
property.
and...
and
i
think
there's
no
question
that
it
comprises
the
bulk
of
the
land,
and...
and
i
wouldn't
expect
the
government
to
dispute
that
here
today.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
thank
you.
one
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
as
clear
as
i
possibly
could
is
that
sand
and
gravel
was
not
locatable
under
the
mining
law
from
1872
onward.
it...
it...
the
interior
department
was
as
clear
as
could
be
in
published
decisions
that
common
material
like
sand
and
gravel
and
clay
were
not
subject
to
the
1872
mining
law,
not
within
the
class
of
valuable
minerals.
the...
the
first
published
decision
we
see
on
this
is
in
the
1880's
and
we
see
a
repeated
line
of
cases
from
1901
through
1919.
they're
all
cited
in
our
opening
brief.
we
really
shouldn't
have
an
issue
about
that.
it
was
not
until
1929--
mr.
r.
timothy
mccrum
--i
have
great
respect
for
my
opponent,
mr.
sansonetti,
but
i...
i
think
that
this
point
that
i'm
making
is...
is
as
clear
as
could
be
in
the
record.
and
the
zimmerman
case
is
not
an
isolated
case.
it's
merely
a
case
in
1910
that
is
stating
this
very
explicitly
in
the
case
of
sand
and
gravel
that
this
was
actually
the
general
understanding
and
that
the
department
was
not
even
receiving
applications
for
sand
and
gravel
mining
claims
because
this
was
so
well
known.
it
was
not
until
1929
in
the
layman
v.
ellis
decision
where
the
department
changed
that
rule,
10
years
after
the
pittman
act
in
this
case.
then
it
was
determined
on
a
site-specific
basis.
that's
the
site-specific
base...
basis
argument
that
we
are
putting
forward
here,
which
then
was
adopted
in
the
1956
solicitor's
opinion
in
the
context
of
mineral
reservations.
there
was
some
reference
to
the
soderberg
case
of
this
court
in
1903.
that
involved
valuable
granite
building
stone
of
the
type
that
we
see
here
in
the
jefferson
memorial
and
around
this
city.
not...
it
was
not
a
surprising
ruling
when
this
court
upheld
the
position
of
the
interior
department
patent
that
valuable
granite
could
be
subject
to
the
mining
law
within
the
class
of
valuable
minerals.
by
then,
in
1897,
in
the
pacific
coast
marble
case,
the
interior
department
had
already
ruled
that
marble
was
a
valuable
mineral,
which
is
an
eminently
sound
ruling
looking
at
the
marble
in
this
court
building,
which
is
quite
different
from
common
sand
and
gravel.
