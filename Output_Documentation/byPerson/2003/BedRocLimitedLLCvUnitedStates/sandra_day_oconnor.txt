well,
western
nuclear
certainly
cuts
the
other
way
from
your
argument
here
today.
i
didn't
agree
with
the
holding,
but
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court.
it
was
under
a
different
act,
not
the
pittman
act,
but
certainly
very
similar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
the
problem
is
you
have
western
nuclear,
which
said
that
gravel
was
a
mineral.
now
you've
got
a
statute
in
the
pittman
act
that
says
valuable
minerals,
which
brings
you
to
your
fall-back
position
which
is
that
if
at
the
time
of
patenting
the
land
it
wasn't
valuable
commercially,
then
it
isn't
covered.
justice
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
little
odd
in
this
pittman
act
because
it...
it
does
in
section
8
refer
to
valuable
minerals,
but
at
various
other
times
in
the
act,
it
just
says
minerals.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
that
term
used
in
any
other
act
that
we'd
be
concerned
with
the
term,
valuable
minerals,
as
a
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you
could
take
the
position
that
a
mineral
like
uranium
has
some
intrinsic
value,
very
little
as
of
1919
and
more
today,
but
that
sand
and
gravel
neither
in
1919
nor
today
has
any
intrinsic
value
as
a
mineral.
it
is
only
when
it
is
located
near
an
urban
center
and
therefore
has
value
as
a
convenience.
i
suppose
that
would
be
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
coal?
how
about
coal
and
how
about
copper--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--where
you
destroy
huge
areas
of
the
surface?
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
what...
at
what
point
did
the
department
of
interior
take
the
position
that
you
could
get
a
mining
claim
under
the
mining
act
for
sand
and
gravel
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you...
you
think
you
can
show
that
patented
mining
claims
were
allowed
for
sand
and
gravel
on
public
lands
that
early?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
opponent
flatly
disagrees
with
you,
doesn't
he,
on
that?
