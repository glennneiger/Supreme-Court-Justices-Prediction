mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--the
united
states
is
saying
that
the
sand
and
gravel
was,
indeed,
valuable
as
a
matter
of
a
category
of
minerals.
in
other
words,
the
category
of
sand
and
gravel
was
valuable
actually,
we're
saying,
as
far
back
as
1919,
that
the
actual
passage
date
of
the
pittman
act
in
1919
was
the
exact
time
that
sand
and
gravel
was
valuable.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
in
that
case
i
wouldn't,
though,
your
honor,
because
topsoil
also
mixes
both
organic
and
inorganic
materials.
and
the
test
that
the...
that
the
court
set
out
in
western
nuclear
was
four-legged,
and
the
four-part
test
for
a
mineral
was
that
it
be
inorganic.
extractable
from
the
soil
was
the
second
leg.
third
one
was
usable
for
a
commercial
purpose,
and
the
fourth
one
was
that
the...
the
mineral
was
not
somehow
to
be
included
in
the
use
of
the
surface
estate.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
that
would
not
be
a
problem
in
this
particular
instance,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
sand
and
the
gravel
are
really
just
a
matter
of
size.
in
order,
they
go
silt,
sand,
gravel,
cobble,
building
stone.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
oh,
yes,
because
sand
is
a
mineral.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
yes,
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
now,
i
think
that
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
is
take
a
look
at
the
purposes
of
the
passage
of
both
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
and
the
pittman
act.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
surface,
yes.
minerals,
no.
the...
the
justice
is...
justice
breyer
is...
is
correct.
the
degree
that
the
surface
has
been
given
to
the
patentee,
the
patentee
has
total
control
of
the
surface--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--initially
the
answer
to
that...
that
question
is
yes
because
if
you
look
at
section
3
of
the
pittman
act,
it
refers
to
an
affidavit
that
must
be
signed
by
the
patentee
coming
onto
the
land,
and
that
affidavit
states
that
they
are
applying
for
this
patent
for
the
purposes
of
reclamation
and
cultivation
and
it
states
that
they
are
not
there
as
an
agent
for
any
other
corporation,
mining
company,
or
anything
like
that.
they
are
there
for
the
surface.
basically--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--and...
and
let
me...
if
i
may
shorten
our
own
then,
let
me
say
that
congress,
in
looking
at
both
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
and
the
pittman
act,
was
basically
saying
to
the
patentees
through
the
mineral
reservation,
you
could
have
the
surface
of
the
land...
initially
the
thought
was,
of
course,
farming.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
okay.
at...
the...
the
gravel
on
the
surface
that
is
usable
for
commercial
purposes
belongs
to
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
if
they
wanted
to
use
the
sand
and
gravel
as
part
of
their
surface
operation
as
in
the
farming
where
you
want
to
gravel
a
road,
when
you
turn
it
into
cement,
as
was
done
in
this
case...
the
farmer
butler
that
obtained
the
patent
in
1940
used
some
of
the
sand
and
gravel
to
make
concrete
to
provide
patios,
et
cetera.
as
long
as
it
is
linked
to
the
purpose
of
the
surface,
it
belongs
to
the
farmer,
but
if
it's
not,
it
belongs
to
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
the...
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--well,
i
think
that
it--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--or
his
teeth,
yes.
for...
the
long-term
policy
of
the
department
of
interior
and
the
bureau
of
land
management,
as
is
spelled
out
in
great
length
in
footnotes
3
and
14
of
western
nuclear,
is
that
it's
always
been
okay
for
the
owner
of
a
surface
estate
to
go
ahead
and
utilize
a
mineral
so
long
as
it
is
incident
to
the
purposes--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--ordinary
farming.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
the...
the
answer
is--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--the...
the
mineral
estate
is
indeed
dominant,
justice
scalia,
and
in
fact,
the
congress
already
thought
ahead
about
what
would
happen
if
the
entire
surface
did
need
to
get
destroyed
to
going
to
a
very
valuable
mineral.
and
that
is...
and
that
thought
by
congress
is
included
in
sentences
3
and
4
of
section
8
of
the
pittman
act
where
they
make
provisions
for
exactly
what
to
do
if
you
have
to
come
in
and
locate
a
mineral
or
today
you
actually
contract
or
sale
your...
your
sand
and
gravel.
here's
what
it
said.
it
said
that
that
person
may
come
on
the
land
provided
he
shall
not
injure,
damage,
or
destroy
the
permanent
improvements
of
the
entryman
or
patentee
and
shall
be
liable
and
shall
compensate
the
entryman
or
patentee
for
all
damages
to
the
crops
by
reason
of
such
prospecting.
and
that
covers
those
that
locate
under
sentence
3,
and
under
sentence
4
it
covers
those
that
acquire
a
right
to
obtain
the
mineral
through
a
contract.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
the
fact
here,
though...
i
mean,
the...
the
answer
is,
is
that
some
minerals
can
be
extracted
without
much
harm
to
the
surface.
a
lot
of
them
do
require
it,
though.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
of
course--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--you
certainly
do,
justice
o'connor.
and...
and
the
fact
is
that
that
is
exactly
what
was
contemplated
ahead
of
time
when
this
particular
act
was
passed.
the
minerals
belong
to
the
united
states.
and
if
it
was
copper
and
you
needed
a
gigantic
pit,
so
be
it.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
gigantic
pit.
let's
not...
you
know,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
joint
appendix
picture
15,
you
actually
see
what
we're
talking
about
there.
this
is
not
just
a...
a
surface
operation.
it's
a
huge
pit.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
and
that's...
that's
what
we
have
here.
we
have
got
a
gigantic
hole.
and
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
difference
between
the
dirt
and
the
topsoil
which
goes
to
the
farming
element
of
all
this
and
the
sand
and
gravel
which
may
be
a
humble
mineral
compared
to
gold
or
silver.
maybe
the
sand
and
gravel
are
the...
the
poor
stepchildren
to
brother
gold
and...
and
sister
silver,
but
they're
just
as
valuable
as
a
member
of
the
mineral
family.
let
me
note
that--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--right,
but
i
brought
that
up
because
the
question
about
topsoil.
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
i
was
distinguishing
what
is
part
of
the
surface
versus
sand
and
gravel
which
is
not
part
of
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--clay
can...
clay
is
like
sand
in
there.
but
the
point
is
is
that
sand
and
gravel,
as
far
back
in
the
1800's,
much
less
at
the
point
that
i
want
to
bring
our...
the...
the
court's
attention
to,
which
is
1919
where
the
pittman
act
is
passed--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--sand
and
gravel...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
yes,
because
actually
this
court
in
1903
in
the
soderberg
case
said
gravel
is
a
mineral.
sand
and
gravel
is
a
mineral.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
actually
in
that
particular
case,
you
would
look
at
quartz.
if
it
was
something
that
they
were
using
as
part
of
their
surface...
they
may
have
a
greenhouse
or
whatever...
then
obviously
the
bureau
of
land
management
is
not
interested
in...
in
taking
the
person's
cactus
or
whatever.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
no,
not...
not
as
to
gravel.
i
said
granite.
he
asked
about
granite.
granite.
soderberg
said
granite
is
a
mineral.
now,
there
was
dicta
in
soderberg,
though,
that
quoted
that...
favorably
that
gravel
was
also
a
mineral.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
as
of
1872,
as
i
understand
it,
justice
o'connor.
and...
and
now
to
the
1919
part--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--in...
in
fact,
with
the
passage
of
the
1872
mining
act,
that
was
the
first
opportunity
under
that
law
for
people
go
after
sand
and
gravel.
it
was
not
until
1947
with
the
passage
of
the
mineral
materials
act
that
you
could
obtain
sand
and
gravel
either
by
locating
it
through
the
1872
mining
act
or
obtaining
a
contract
for
lease.
that
changed.
that
contract
for
sale.
excuse
me.
and
that
changed
in
1955
with
the
passage
of
the
common
varietals
act
where
the
only
way
you
could
obtain
sand
and
gravel
today...
well,
ever
since
1955...
is
by
sale
contract.
you
go
to
the
bureau
of
land
management
and
you
say
you
want
10,000
cubic
yards
of
sand
and
gravel.
you
pay
35
cents
or
something
like
that
that
you
bid
to
take
each
cubic
yard
out,
and
once
that
is
out,
of
course,
the
35
cents
goes
to
the
united
states
government,
treasury,
and
the
remainder,
of
course,
goes
for
the
sale
of
the
sand
and
gravel.
but
while
it
is
valuable,
obviously,
in
1993
when
the
petitioners
were
so
interested
in
coming
into
the
farmer's
shoes...
this
is
a
mining
operator
bedroc
stepping
into
the
shoes
of
a
farmer,
those
that
had
gone
ahead
and
stayed
on
the
surface
of
the
land
from
1940
to
1993,
now
wanting
to
produce
sand
and
gravel.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
well,
the...
the
terms
of
the
grant
did
not
change,
but
i
think
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
exactly
what
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was.
and
here
it
was
congress'
intent
to
concurrently
develop
the
surface
of
these
lands
and
the
mineral
estates.
the
goal
was
to
get
new
farmers
to
farm,
new
ranchers
to
ranch,
while
leaving
the
mineral
estate
to
those
that
would
be
able
to
exploit
that
mineral
and
were
after
the
mineral
because
they
wanted
to
be
mineral
operators,
not
because
they
came
on
the
land
as
farmers.
this
was
the
problem
with
all
the
fraud
that
was
going
on
under
the
old
land
classification
system
where
people
would
come
onto
the
land
saying
this
is
non-mineral.
i
wanted
to
be
an
agriculturalist,
and
then
as
soon
as
they'd
get
the
patent
to
everything,
including
the
surface
and...
and
the
minerals,
they
were
selling
out
to
the
coal
companies.
and
that's
what
brought
out
the
1906
reservation
of
the
coal,
and
then
you
have
the
1909
act
which
says
the
patentee
gets
everything
but
the
coal.
and
then
in
1916
and
1919
we
have
these
two
acts
that
say,
nope,
we're
now
going,
congress
says,
to
a
split
estate
system
where
the
surface
goes
to
the
surface
grantee,
the
patentee,
and
a
mineral
operator
must
come
to
the
united
states
to
get
any
type
of
mineral.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
that...
that
is
correct.
and
that's
where
the
test
of
western
nuclear
comes
in.
if
you
want
to
know
whether
something
is
a
mineral
or
not,
you
apply
the
test.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
well,
zimmerman
in...
the
zimmerman
case
was...
was
the
department
of
the
interior
that
counsel
has
been
referring
to,
zimmerman,
which
was
in
1910,
that
said
that
sand
and
gravel
did
not
equal
mineral
lands.
so
up
until
1910,
the
question
was,
yes,
it
was...
it
was
a
mineral.
and
the
things...
things
to
note
about
this.
first
of
all,
zimmerman
was
specifically
part
of
the
western
nuclear
case
and
is
rejected
at
pages
45
and
46
of
that
opinion.
the
second
thing
is
is
that
that
opinion,
issued
by
the
department
of
the
interior,
was
never
tested
in
the
courts.
it
is
certainly--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--no,
but
it
does
mean
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
department
of
the
interior's
ability
to
inform
the
congress
at
the
time
that
this
act
passed
in
1919
and
their
ability
to
bind
the
congress.
the
solicitor's
opinion
is
not
binding
on
the
congress
that
that
meant
that
sand
and
gravel
fell
out
from
the
definition
of
valuable
minerals
in
1919,
particularly
since
in
1919
sand
and
gravel
was
the
fifth
largest
value
of
minerals
produced
in
the
united
states
that
were
nonmetallic.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
no.
actually
as...
as
you
can
see
in
the
joint
appendix,
pages
56
through
118,
there
are
a
series
of
annual
mineral
reports
that
were
utilized
in
both
of
the...
the
district
court
case
and
the
appellate
court
case
in...
in
bedroc,
that
spell
out
that
by
1911,
there
was
already
a
national
association
of
sand
and
gravel
producers,
including
associations
of
state
sand
and
gravel
producers,
in
14
different
states.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
and...
and
nevada
is
included.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
michigan,
texas,
california,
and
i
would
note,
i
believe,
it
is
at
joint
appendix...
i
believe
the
page
is
56
that
shows
that
sand
used
for
the
making
of
glass
had
already
been
discovered
in
nevada
as
of
1918.
so...
and--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--the...
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--you
could
locate
sand
and
gravel
from
1872
up
to
1910.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
i
don't
know
the
exact
answer
to
your
question,
but
i
can
say
in
regard
to
this--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--it's
before
1940
because
in
1919
the
department
of
the...
as
of
1919,
the
congress
had
stated
that
sand
and
gravel
is
a
valuable
mineral.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
it
was
that...
okay,
first
of
all,
the
1956
solicitor's
opinion
was
also
reviewed
by
this
court
in
western
nuclear.
and
the
only
portion
of
the
solicitor's
opinion
that
was
approved
by
this
court
was
the
finding
that
gravel
was
a
mineral.
the...
this
court
in--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--it
did
not
adopt
it.
in
other
words,
it
was
considered,
but
not
adopted.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
it
did
not,
but
then
that's
because
western
nuclear
didn't
answer
this
precise
question
of
site-specific.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
well,
for
one,
it's
the
practice
that
has
been
followed
since
that
time.
since
site-specific
is
what's
being
mentioned
in
the
solicitor's
opinion...
and
frankly,
it's
an
issue
that
related
to
an
indian
reservation...
has
absolutely
no
basis
with
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
grants
or
the
pittman
act
grants.
the
statute
at
issue
there
related
to
an
indian
reservation.
it
continued
to
grant
united
states
control
over
all
the
minerals
on
that
reservation,
considered
the
trust
responsibility.
there
were
other
elements
being
considered
there
rather
than
whether
or
not
site
specificity
should
be
what
the
blm
follows
all
across
the
board.
note
that
we
are
here--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--your
honor,
we're
mixing
up
two
things.
the
1872
mining
act
is
an
act
that...
that
tells
you
how
to
obtain
a
mineral.
the
reservation
we're
talking
about
today
is
describing
what
is
covered
by
the
mineral.
once
you've
got
the
what,
then
you
can
decide
the
how,
whether
it's
the
1872
act
which
has
these
deposit
references
and...
and
the
like,
or
whether
something
is
saleable
under
contract.
that...
those
are
the
hows.
today
we're
talking
about
the
what,
what
is
covered
by
the
reservation.
and
the
pittman
act
house
report
notes
that
the
reservations
in
both
the
srha,
the
stock-raising
homestead
act,
and
the
pittman
act
are
identical.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
it
does
not
prevail
over
the
statute
except
let
me
come
back
to
the
question
about
the
two
words
being...
the
two
phrases
being
different
because
section
8
of
the
bill...
again,
pittman
was
passed
after
the
stock-raising
homestead
act,
and
the
actual
quote
is
that
section
8
of
the
pittman
act
contains
the
same
reservations
of
minerals
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
the
stock-raising
homestead
act.
now--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--and
now
as
to
the
quotes
from
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
okay.
now
as
to
the
actual
statutes.
in
the
stock-raising
homestead
act,
it
is
all
the
coal
and
other
minerals.
that's
section
9.
in
section
8
of
the
pittman
act,
it
is
all
the
coal
and
other
valuable
minerals.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
okay?
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
if...
if
i
may,
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
those
two
phrases,
valuable
minerals
and
minerals,
are
synonymous.
the
word
valuable
definitely
has
a
meaning.
that
meaning
was
set
out
in
western
nuclear
as
being
used
for
commercial
purposes.
so
used
for
commercial
purposes,
the
concept
of
value
is
definitely
part
of
the
stock-raising
homestead
act,
and
consequently,
it
means
the
mineral
must
be
valuable.
in
pittman,
you've
got
again
the
exact
same
language
of
section
8
and
section
9
with
the
addition
of
the
word
valuable.
it
appears
eight
times
in
both
of...
of
those
sections,
and
it
is
our...
our
position
then
that
they
are
interchangeable.
minerals
sometimes,
valuable
mineral
other
times.
so
it's
a
distinction
without
a
difference
and
valuable
is
definitely
not
a
word
of
surplus.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
let...
let
me
try
it
in...
in
this
fashion
because
we're
talking
about
expectations
here
and
what
the
patentee,
the
surface
owner,
is
obtaining
and
how
it
passes
that
on
to
successors.
the
united
states
was
saying
through
the
congress
through
both
of
these
acts
that
the
mineral...
through
the
mineral
reservations
that
you,
the
patentee,
can
come
onto
the
surface
of
this
land,
use
it
as
you
will.
we,
the
citizens
of
the
united
states,
keep
anything
that
may
be
found
on
or
underneath
that
land
that
has
mineral
value.
the
patentee
gets
to
use
the
surface
as
his
benefit
of
the
bargain
and
should
not
expect
anything
else.
if
there
are
windfalls...
if
there
are
windfalls
of
valuable
minerals
that
no
one
knew
were
under
these
lands
in
nevada,
if
any,
they
should
belong
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
and--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--they...
they
do...
they
do
because
there's
no
congressional
mandate
in
those...
in
those
state
court
cases.
those
state
court
cases
invariably
have
situations
where
the
reservations
may
or
may
not
be
applied
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
in
reference
to
the
hess
case
for
instance.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
they...
they
would
be
the
same
except
in
our
instance,
they're
much
more
clearly
laid
out
because
once
that
affidavit
is
signed
under
section
3,
then
you
have
the
person
coming
onto
the
land
contemplating
cultivation.
they
are
signing
an
affidavit
saying
they
want
the
free
land,
and
it's
free
land.
for
20
acres
of
crops,
they
get
up
to
640
acres
of
free
land.
and
they
get
the
appreciation
of
that
land.
this
particular
plot
happens
to
be
just
north
of
las
vegas.
if
it
appreciates--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--they
have
to--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--yes,
they
did.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
but
the
fact
is
is
at
the
point
where
they
did
find
water,
they
applied
for
the
patent.
they
get
their
640
acres.
in
this
case
it
was
560.
they
acknowledge
that
they
are
getting
this
free
land
for
crops.
they
grew
the
crops,
the
20
acres'
worth
of
crops
that
had
been
grown
that
got
them
the
opportunity
to
file
their
final
certificate
and
obtain
that
patent.
now,
remember,
if
this
land
appreciates,
they
get
the
benefit
of
that
bargain,
the
same
way
as
if
the
united
states
happens
to
find
that
there
is
a
valuable
mineral
underneath,
they
happen
to
benefit
from
it.
this
could
be
a
golf
course
or
a
walmart
or
anything
in
a
few
years
north
of
las
vegas.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
the
united
states
is
not
asking
for
that
appreciation.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
any...
as
i
understand
it,
that
under
nevada
state
law,
the
water
actually
that
was
found
by
farmer
butler
in
this
case
is...
is
dealt
with
by
the
nevada
state
water
engineer.
so
long
as
he
uses
it
for
beneficial
uses,
the
permission
to
take
it
off
premises
or
on
premises
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
reservation.
it
has
to
do
with
farmer
butler
and
nevada
state
law.
but
i
would
like
to
note
a
couple
quick
things
in
regard
to
the
bad
consequences
of
a
site-specific
test
because
it
does
place
the
ownership
of
other
minerals
into
doubt.
it's
not
just
gold
or
silver
that
we're
dealing
with
on
one
hand
and
sand
and
gravel
or
some
ubiquitous
common
gravel
over
here.
what
happens?
what's
the
test
then
for
things
like
trona
or
bentonite
or
limestone
or
dolomite
or
any
other
thing.
you
mentioned
uranium.
uranium
was
used
for
watch
dials
way
back
in
1919,
but
of
course,
we
now
see
it
has
a
much
more
important
purpose
today.
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
ah,
and
if
it
was,
it
would
be
a
mineral
reserved
to
the
united
states.
but
if
the
site-specific
test
is
put
into
place,
imagine
then
the
practical
difficulties
in
trying
to
show
that
from
the
bureau
of
land
management's
point
of
view
going
back
in
time--
mr.
thomas
l.
sansonetti
--well,
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
doubt
on...
on
the
court
about
whether
or
not
gravel
is
a
mineral
reserved
to
the
united
states
in
the
pittman
act
reservation,
we
feel
it
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government
due
to
the
old
canon
of
construction
that
says
that
about
the
scope
of
land
grants
are
construed
favorably
to
the
government.
thank
you.
