mr.
mccrum.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
applied
only
in
nevada,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
now...
the
time
you're
referring
to
is
1919
or
1940?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
that
because
the
word
valuable
didn't
include
in
the...
wasn't
included
in
the
reservation
of
stock-raisers
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
fall...
your
fall-back
position
would
extend
only
to
nevada,
i
take
it,
and
the
fact
that
it
was
valuable
would
be
distinguishing
from
the
western
nuclear
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
your
time,
mr.
mccrum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
sansonetti.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sansonetti,
i
looked
in
the...
to
get
some
statistics
about
what
nevada
was
like
in
1940,
and
it
had
a...
a
total
population
of
110,000.
it
has
an
area
of
100,000
square
miles,
which
is
about
1
person
per
square
mile.
las
vegas
had
a
population
of
8,000.
this
property
is
65
miles
away
from
las
vegas.
does
the
government
say
that
it...
that
this
was
a
valuable
mineral
in
1940
when
the
patent
was
issued?
and
if
not,
when
did
it
become
valuable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if...
what
if
you
had
only
sand,
which
wasn't
covered
by
western
nuclear?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that's
no
problem
for
the
government.
the
government
gets
the
sand
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
problem
for
me,
even
if
it's
not
for
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
if...
what
if
the
surface
had...
what
if
the
gravel
was
on
the
surface?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
didn't
even
get
that
part
of
the
surface.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the...
the
holding...
the
holding
in
soderberg
was
that
granite
outcroppings
were
reserved.
that...
it
didn't
talk
about...
it
didn't
hold
as
to
gravel,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you...
are
you
suggesting
that
because
the
grantee
in
this
case
was...
was
a
commercial
operation,
somehow
the...
the
value
of
the
grant
or
the
terms
of
the
grant
had
changed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's...
let's
go
back
before
western...
i
think
justice
scalia's
question...
i
don't
think
your
answer
is
consistent
with
what
the
government
did
in
the
zimmerman
case,
the
department,
which
was
questioned
later.
but
certainly
at
the
time
of
zimmerman,
it...
it
was
not
a...
it
was
not
regarded
as
a
mineral,
was
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
wait
a
minute.
does
that
mean
an
opinion...
say,
an
agency
opinion...
has
no
value
if
it's
never
been
tested
in
the
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
where...
where
was
that
sand
and
gravel
value
concentrated?
it
was
concentrated
on
the
east
coast
because
of
world
war
i,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
where...
and
where
else
were
the
14
states?
if
you
don't
have
it
handy,
don't--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that...
that
can't
be
correct,
can
it,
because
one
uses
the
term
valuable
and
the
other
doesn't?
and
the
house
report
certainly
doesn't
prevail
over
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
not
a
quote
from
the
statute.
that's
a
quote
from
the
report.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you...
will
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sansonetti.
mr.
mccrum,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccrum.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
02-1593,
bedroc
and
western
elite
versus
the
united
states.
the
pittman
act
of
1919
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
grant
up
to
640
acres
of
land
to
any
settler
who
discovered
a
significant
source
of
underground
water
in
the
nevada
desert.
and
this
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
since
nevada
is
the
driest
state
in
the
country.
the
act
provided
however
that
all
the
coal
and
other
valuable
minerals
found
in
the
land
were
reserved
to
the
united
states.
in
1940,
newton
and
mable
butler
received
a
land
grant
under
the
act.
sand
and
gravel
were
abundant
on
the
surface
of
their
property,
but
because
of
nevada’s
sparse
population,
there
was
no
commercial
market
for
them.
by
1993,
more
than
50
years
later,
a
market
had
developed
and
the
then
owner
earl
williams
began
to
extract
and
sell
the
sand
and
gravel
found
on
the
land.
this
is
because
of
the
growth
of
the
city
of
las
vegas
which
is
about
65
miles
away.
the
bureau
of
land
management
ordered
williams
to
stop,
finding
that
he
was
trespassing
against
the
united
states’
ownership
of
the
land’s
valuable
minerals,
and
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals
affirmed.
the
petitioner
bedroc,
who
acquired
the
land
from
williams,
sued
the
united
states
in
the
district
court
of
nevada
claiming
that
the
land's
sand,
and
gravel
were
not
valuable
minerals.
the
district
court
disagreed
and
concluded
that
sand
and
gravel
are
valuable
minerals
under
the
pittman
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
relying
primarily
on
our
decision
in
watt
versus
western
nuclear
in
which
we
held
that
gravel
is
a
mineral
reserve
to
the
united
states
under
a
similar
land
grant
statute.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
to
determine
the
scope
of
a
mineral
reservation,
we
looked
at
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words
congress
used
at
the
time
and
within
the
context
they
have
used
them.
therefore,
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
sand
and
gravel
found
in
nevada
were
ordinarily
considered
valuable
minerals
in
1919.
common
sense
tells
us
the
answer
is
no.
sand
and
gravel
were
and
are
plentiful
throughout
nevada,
indeed
the
state
is
largely
composed
with
the
sand
and
gravel.
and
due
to
its
sparse
population
in
1919,
there
was
no
commercial
market
for
such
minerals.
the
statutory
context
of
the
mineral
reservation
confirms
this
common
sense
conclusion.
the
following
sentences
states
that
all
the
coal
and
other
valuable
mineral
deposits
are
subject
to
disposal
by
the
united
states
and
under
the
general
mining
laws.
congress
obviously
believed
that
any
reserved
valuable
mineral
would
also
be
subject
to
location
of
the
general
mining
law.
decisions
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
however,
demonstrates
that
in
1919
sand
and
gravel
would
not
support
a
mineral
location.
now
withstanding
the
plain,
meaning
the
mineral
reservation,
the
government
argues
that
our
decision
in
western
nuclear
requires
us
to
hold
in
its
favor.
we
disagree.
regardless
of
whether
western
nuclear
was
correct
in
holding
that
a
gravel
is
a
mineral,
we
will
not
extend
its
holding
to
conclude
that
sand
and
gravel
are
valuable
minerals
under
the
pittman
act.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
i
have
written
an
opinion

the
judgment
