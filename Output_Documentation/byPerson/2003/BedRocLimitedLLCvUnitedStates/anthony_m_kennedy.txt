does
the
gravel
excavation
take
up
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
about
16
to
20
acres
out
of
some
500,
which
is
the
total
surface
area
or?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
know,
is
that
the
sum
total
of
the
gravel
that's
there?
could
they...
does
it
go
on
for
the...
another
100
acres
or
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at...
at
the
time
of
the
patent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one...
one
way
to...
to
rule
for
your
client
here
would
be
for
the
court
to
hold
that
it
is
not
a
mineral
if
it
can't
be
removed
without
disturbing
the...
the
surface,
and
that
certainly
would
resolve
this
case.
i'm
hesitant
to
say
that,
though,
because
of
the
placer
mining
of
gold,
et
cetera.
could
you
comment
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
that's
what's
bothering
me.
what...
what
are
we
to
do
with
that
factor?
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
get
the
gravel
without
completely
destroying
the...
the
surface
use
that...
that
the
owner
might
want
to
put
to
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--assuming
there's
a
different
owner.
this...
this
happens
to
be
the
owner
that
makes
that
choice.
justice
kennedy
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
and...
and
it's
only
a
supposition...
that
we
were
to
reconsider
our...
our
earlier
case,
western
nuclear,
and...
and
overrule
it.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
then...
then
there
would
be
chaotic
lawsuits
to
follow
because
there
would
not...
not
have
been
intentional
trespasses
but
the
wrong
people
would
have
been
extracting
the
minerals
if
there
had
ever
been
a...
a
grant
by
the
government
to...
to
a
person
other
than
the
owner
of
the
fee.
is
there
any
precedent
in
the
court
for
how
we
unwind
the...
the
clock,
or
whatever
the
metaphor
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it...
is
it
true?
i...
i
suppose
there's...
there's
placer
mining
even
for
gold
and
i...
i
guess
in
some
instances
for
coal.
but
i...
i
must
tell
you
my...
my
assumption
is
that
most
mineral
easements
can
be
exploited
without
undue
disturbance
of
the
surface.
do
you
want
to
tell
me
that
that's
just
wrong
empirically,
factually?
other
than
gravel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
most
of
the
states
that
have
ruled
on
this
subject...
most
of
the
state
courts
that
have
ruled
on
this
subject,
have
come
out
the
other
way
from
western
nuclear.
do
they
have
a
different
perspective
or
different
concerns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
the
practical
problems
and
the...
and...
and
the
likely
expectations
and
understanding
of
the
purchasers
would
be
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
the
property
owner
had
exported...
transported
the
water
to
las
vegas
for
a
municipal
water
supply,
would
that
be
consistent
with
reclamation?
