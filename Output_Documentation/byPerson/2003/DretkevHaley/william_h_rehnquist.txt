chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
02-1824,
doug
dretke
v.
michael
wayne
haley.
mr.
cruz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
actually...
what
was
he
charged
with,
mr.
cruz?
what
was
the
substantive
offense
and
what
were
the
recidivist
offenses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
did
the
first
felony
take
so
long
to
become
final?
it
took...
you
say
it
took
3
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cruz.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
one
tremendous
advantage
the
government
has
over
individual
criminal
defendants'
lawyers,
isn't
it?
they
choose
the
facts
they
want
to
bring
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
do,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
albritton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
has
never
extended
beyond
the
capital
sentence
context
either,
has
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we...
we
haven't
in...
in
at
least
two
or
three
cases
when
we
have
a
question
of
certiorari,
we've
said
that
there's
a
logically
preceding
question
that
has
to
be
decided
before
we
can
get
to
that.
so
it
seems
to
me
this
might
be
that
kind
of
a
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in...
in
your...
in
your
view,
mr.
albritton,
there's
no
requirement
that
this
evidence
be
newly
discovered,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are...
would
you
say,
taking
it
from
there
to
the
future
dangerous,
that
the...
the
prosecutor
was
in
error
in
the
sense
you
refer
to
if
he
alleged
that
the
petitioner
is
going
to
be
a
future
danger?
are
all
these
allegations
just
going
to
be
turned
out
that
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are...
are
you
suggesting
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
deliberately,
when
he
alleged
the
thing,
knew
that
it
was
not...
wouldn't
stand
up?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then...
but
then
it
really
isn't
a
basis
for
distinguishing
the
two
examples
i
gave
you
for
just
you
to
say,
well,
in
the
first
case
the
prosecutor
acted
in
good
faith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
could
say
that
about
an
allegation
of
future
dangerous
too.
you
have
the...
that's
alleged
in
the
complaint,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
or
the
defendant's
attorney
could
have
done
that
too,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
pretty
much
the
tail
wagging
the...
the
tail
wagging
the
dog,
i
mean,
if...
if
you
say
that
the
date
of
the
offense
is...
is
a
separate
element?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
albritton.
mr.
cruz,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cruz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1824,
dretke
against
haley
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
