justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
why...
why
isn't
there
still
an
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
claim
out
there,
and
why
shouldn't
the
court
address
that
before
it
gets
into
the
question
that
it
dealt
with?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
don't
we
vacate
and
remand
and
let
them
deal
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
that
claim
was
waived
here?
you
don't
urge
us
to
make
that
finding,
do
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except
the
court
below
didn't
decide
that
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
i
would
think
so
too.
i
can't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
should
we
do
in
this
case
with
someone
who...
who
is
serving
an
unjust
sentence
under
the
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
inadequate
assistance
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
urge
that
that's
waived,
or
can
the
court
below
address
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
is
some
suggestion
in
our
cases
that
other
claims
ought
to
be
addressed
before
resorting
to
that,
such
as
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
you
think
that
counsel's
performance
was
adequate
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
if
it's
our
view
that
the
court
below
addressed
that
out
of
order
too
soon
when
it
had
an
alternative,
certainly
we
could
vacate
and
remand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you'd
like
your
client
out
of
jail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
doesn't
sound
like
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
habeas
corpus
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
court
held
that
the
respondent,
michael
wayne
haley,
was
not
barred
from
asserting
his
procedurally
defaulted
challenge
to
the
state
courts
in
position
of
a
recidivous
sentencing
enhancement,
because
he
was
actually
innocent
of
defactual
predicate
giving
rise
to
the
enhancement.
we
vacate
that
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
respondent’s
sentence
for
theft
was
enhanced
under
texas’
habitual
offender
statute
based
on
two
prior
felony
convictions.
as
it
turns
out,
the
evidence
concerning
the
timing
of
one
of
his
prior
convictions
was
insufficient
to
support
the
particular
enhancement.
respondent
did
not
object
to
that
insufficiency
until
state
postconviction
proceedings.
the
state
court
dismissed
the
objection
on
procedural
grounds
and
denied
the
accompany
ineffective
of
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
although
the
insufficiency
claim
was
procedurally
defaulted
then
when
the
respondent
filed
for
a
federal
habeas
corpus,
the
district
court
heard
it
nonetheless
on
the
grounds
that
respondent
was
actually
innocent
of
one
of
the
factual
predicates
giving
rise
to
the
sentence
enhancement.
the
district
court
granted
relief
on
the
insufficiency
claim.
it
did
not
reach
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
question
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
normally,
claims
of
error
in
a
criminal
trial
which
are
not
timely
made
in
state
court
cannot
later
be
made
by
the
defendant
in
a
federal
habeas
proceeding.
we
have
recognized
a
narrow
exception
to
the
procedural
default
rule
where
a
habeas
applicant
can
demonstrate
actual
innocence
of
the
substantive
offense
or
in
the
capital
sentencing
context
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
rendering
him
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
we
do
not
decide
today
whether
this
exception
extends
to
the
noncapital
sentencing
context
and
instead
hold
that
a
federal
court
on
habeas
faced
with
allegations
of
actual
innocence
must
first
address
all
nondefaulted
claims
for
comparable
relief
on
other
grounds
as
for
cause
to
excuse
the
procedural
default,
and
this
avoidance
principle
was
implicit
in
our
earlier
actual
innocence
cases.
now
here,
the
respondent
has,
as
the
state
conceives,
a
significant
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
that
the
district
court
should
have
considered
before
reaching
the
actual
innocence
question.
doing
so
would
have
avoided
the
difficult
constitutional
and
other
legal
questions
implicated
by
extending
the
actual
innocence
exception
into
the
noncapital
sentencing
context.
the
state
has
told
us
that
it
will
not
seek
to
reincarcerate
the
respondent
during
the
pendancy
of
this
ineffective
assistance
claim.
justice
stevens
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter
and
kennedy
joined;
justice
kennedy
has
also
written
a
dissenting
opinion.
