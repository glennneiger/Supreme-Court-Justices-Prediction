justice
antonin
scalia
--are
you
saying
you
won't...
you
won't
argue
a
waiver
if
it's
sent
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cruz,
let
me...
let
me
make...
get
clear
what...
what...
what
your
position
is.
you're...
you'd
be
totally
content
if
we
don't
resolve
this
question
that's
before
us
about
whether
whenever
there's
a
procedural
default
that
has
clearly
resulted
and...
and
with
no
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
that
has
clearly
resulted
in
an
injustice,
you
know,
we...
we
throw
away
all
the
procedural
rules.
you...
you
don't
want
us
to
address
that
and
just
send
it
back
and
say,
well,
before
you
get
to
that
question,
you
have
to
resolve
the
cause
and
prejudice
and
then
leave...
leave
dangling
in
the
air
the
question,
the
significant
question,
it
seems
to
me,
on
which
we
granted
cert?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
we...
why
should
we
not
be
inclined
to
do
so?
is
it
a
constitutional
question
that
we
shouldn't
reach?
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
do
a
sort
of
jurisprudential
striptease
and
decide
this
one
case,
leaving
open
this
question?
i
don't
understand
why
we
wouldn't
decide
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
come
back
and
fight
another
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
just
means
it
made
two
mistakes.
number
one,
if
this
theory
that
you're
opposing
did
exist,
it
shouldn't
have
reached
it
first,
okay?
it
should
have
reached
it
second.
mistake
one.
and
number
two,
according
to
you,
is
this
theory
doesn't
exist
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
it's
more
intelligent
for
us
to
reach
the
first
question
than
the
second
if...
if
there
isn't
any
such
thing
as
number
one
and
number
two.
if
the
only
one
that
exists
is
number
one,
it
seems
to
me
we
should
say
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
--they...
they
were
sequential.
i
mean,
one
followed
another.
isn't
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that
he
should
have
been...
he
should
have
been
given
this
longer
sentence
for
the
second
theft
instead
of
for
the
third
theft?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
it,
the...
the...
the
theft
that...
that
was
used
for
recidivism
occurred
3
days
after,
right,
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
but...
but...
no,
what
you
need
to
satisfy
justice
stevens
is...
is
a
case
where
the
mistake
unquestionably
caused
the
outcome
of
the...
unquestionably
caused
the
outcome
of
the
trial
to
be
wrong.
all
of
the
ones
you
just
mentioned,
it
may
have
caused
it
to
be
wrong,
may
not
have,
you
don't...
the
jury
might
have
convicted
him
without
the
confession,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
do
you
have
any
cases
where...
where,
as
here,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
procedural
default
produced
a
different
outcome
in
the
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
when
it's
clear
it
will
always
be
the
case
that
there's
been
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
how...
how
could
it
be,
you
know,
clear
as
day
and
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
not...
not
have
intervened?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
we
free
to
write
this
code
of
criminal
procedure?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
all
these
arguments
being
made
to,
you
know,
to
congress
or...
or
to
the
state
legislatures
for
writing
a
code
of
criminal
procedure,
but
what
is...
what
is
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--justification
for
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--something
which
has
never
been
done
in...
in
a
couple
of
hundred
years
is...
is...
is
part
of
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
federal
habeas
court
has
to
be
relying
upon
some
law
to...
to
undo
the
state
conviction,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
apprendi
had
come
out
the
other
way,
or
if
we
extended
apprendi
to
recidivism?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
scare
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you'd
rather
do
it
sooner
rather
than
later,
right?
you'd
rather
have
us
say
let
him
free
rather
than
send
it
back
down
and
try
it
all
over
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
albritton,
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this.
in
this
case
there
is
a
statute
that
would
not
have
allowed
the
additional
sentence
to
be
imposed
unless
these
things
were
sequential.
suppose
that
wasn't
the
situation.
suppose
what
you
are...
we're
dealing
with
was
a
real
sentencing
factor
of
the
sort
that
a
judge
can
take
into
account
under
a
law
which
says
the
judge
may
sentence
from
10
to
30
years,
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
up
to
the
judge.
and
in
sentencing
him
to
the
maximum,
the
judge
makes
a
mistake
of
fact.
it
is
later
found
that
when
the
judge
said
i'm
giving
him
30
years
because,
you
know,
he's
been
a
really
bad
person
in
light
of
this
background,
and
it
turns
out
that
background
didn't
exist,
all
right?
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
does
make
it
sound
like
what
this
is
is
almendarez-torres,
that...
that...
the...
the
difference
between
the
hypothetical
i
just
posed
to
you
and
this
case
is
simply
that
the
law
would
not
allow
the
additional
time
to
be
imposed
unless
the
fact
was
found,
whereas
in
the
discretionary
case,
the
law
would
have
allowed
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how...
how
do
you
limit
it
to
that
kind
of
a
situation
then?
how...
how
do
you...
how
do
you
give
me
the
answer
that
you've
just
given
me,
that
even
though
you...
you...
you
show
that
the
judge
who
imposed
a
discretionary
sentence
was
absolutely
wrong
for
the
basis
on
which
he
imposed
that
discretionary
sense,
you
wouldn't
allow
that
to
be
reviewed.
why...
what's
the
basis
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
i
just
understand
why
it
makes
any
sense
if
you've
shown
and
can
know
for
sure
that
the
only
reason
the
judge
imposed
the
30
years
was
that
he
believed
a
certain
fact
was
true
which
in
fact
was
not
true,
and
that
is
demonstrated,
and
he
said,
i'm
opposing
30
years
because
of
this,
otherwise,
you
know,
this
would
be
a
10-year
sentence.
and
i...
there's
just
as
much
injustice
there,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
albritton,
it's
a
small
subset
of
the
state
court
cases,
but
it's
a...
it's
a...
it's
a
total...
it's
not
a
subset
at
all
of
the
federal
cases,
right?
because
we
have
a
guideline
system
where,
by
statute,
you
are
not
allowed
to
impose
any
more
than
what
the
guidelines
permit,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
unless
you...
sure,
you...
you
can
make
a
finding
that...
where
that
finding
hasn't
been
made
that
this
is
somehow
extraordinary,
you
cannot,
by
law,
impose
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sentence
is
unlawful
if
it
goes
above
the
guidelines,
which
is
why
it
can
be
set
aside
by
the
appellate
court.
it
is
unlawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you're...
you're
telling
us
that
the...
that
the
existence
of
the
prior
offense
is
not
an
element,
right,
but...
but
that
the
date
of
the
prior
offense
is...
is--
