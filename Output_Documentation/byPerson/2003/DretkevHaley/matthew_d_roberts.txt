mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
actual
innocence
exception
applies
in
the
extraordinary
case
where
a
prisoner
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
that
he
did
not
commit.
the
court
shouldn't
extend
that
narrow
exception
to
the
very
different
situation
where
the
prisoner
is
guilty
of
the
crime
of
which
he
was
convicted.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well...
well,
your
honor,
even
if
this
court
holds
that
the
actual
innocence
exception
doesn't
apply
to
non-capital
sentencing,
respondent
may
well
be
entitled
to
relief
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
on
the
ineffective
assistance
claim,
and
i--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we
don't
believe
that
it's
waived,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that...
that's--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--but
that's
right,
your
honor--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--and
that's
our
primary...
that's
our
primary
concern
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the...
the
court
certainly
could
do
that.
there
is
a
danger
i
think
in...
in
addressing
the
actual
innocence
exception
in
a
case
where
there's
cause
and
prejudice
and
so
you
don't
need
to
address
it,
and
in
a
case
where
the
error
is...
is
clear
when
what
the
real
concern
is
when
it's
not
that
clear
about
whether
somebody's
actually
innocent.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it...
it...
yes,
except
that,
you
know,
certainly
our...
our
primary
interest
in
the
question
here
is
in
the
question
that's
divided
the
circuits
and
in
making
clear
that
there
isn't
a
broad
actual
innocence
exception
as
applied
to...
to
non-capital
sentencing.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we...
we
well
might
not
have
appealed
from
the
district
court
judgment
in
this
case.
if
the
government
takes
an
appeal,
the
solicitor
general
office
has
to...
has
to
approve
those
appeals
and
we
would
certainly--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
we
certainly
would...
would
take
into
account
the
entire
situation
in...
in
making
a
determination
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i...
i
hate
to
predict
it--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--in
any
case,
but
i
would
expect
that
if
it
was
clear
that
there
was
cause
and
prejudice
that
was...
that
a
case
involved
a
situation
where
the
prisoner--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i...
i--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i'm
not...
i'm...
i'm
not
taking
the
position
of
that,
your
honor.
i
just...
i
hesitate
to...
to
make
a
prediction
about
some
future
case
where
i
don't
know
all
the
facts.
i
certainly
think
that
if...
if,
in
a
case
like
this
where
a
prisoner
was
clearly
entitled
to...
had...
had
cause
and
prejudice
and
was
entitled
to
relief,
that
we
would
call
that
to
the
attention
of
the...
of
the
district
court
or
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we...
i...
i...
we
think
that
it's
a
question
to
be
decided
by
the...
the
court
of
appeals
on...
on
remand,
your
honor,
and
the
state
had
made
arguments
about
whether
it
was
preserved
or
not.
justice
o'connor
asked
me
my
opinion
as
to
whether
the...
whether
the
claim
was
preserved,
and
in...
in
our
view
it
was,
but
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
lower
court
to...
to
decide,
and
apparently
the
state
is
no
longer
arguing
that...
that
it
wasn't
preserved.
as
i
said,
our...
our...
the...
the
issue
that
we're
primarily
concerned
about
here
is
a
broad
extension
of
the
actual
innocence
exception
to
an
erroneous
prison
term,
and
that
would
involve
substantial
societal
costs,
because
the
challenges
to
the
findings--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
that
would
certainly
be
a
far
less
problematic
exception.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor,
except
to
the
extent
that
it...
it
extended...
extends
actual
innocence
beyond
an
offense
which
has
a
special
constitutional
status.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
well,
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--these
rules
are--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
my
understanding
is
that
the
actual
innocence
exception
and
the
procedural
default
rules
are
coordinated
limitations
on
the
jurisdiction...
on
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
federal
habeas
court,
and
so
the
court's
exercising
its...
its
supervisory
authority
over
the
courts.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
there
has
to
be
an
underlying
claim.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
but
we're
talking
here
about
the
actual
innocence
exception,
which
is
a
gateway
to
consideration
of
that
underlying
claim.
there...
there
still
has
to
be
an
underlying
constitutional
claim,
and...
and
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
an
issue
that's
not
before
the
court
whether
there
is...
is
such
a
plan.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well...
well...
jack...
jackson,
your
honor,
is
based
on
winship,
which
is
based
on
the
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
when
you're
talking
about
sentencing--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--there
is
no
such
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i...
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
that...
the
elements
of
the
crime
have
all
been
proved.
they're
not...
they're
not
disputed.
what's
disputed
is...
is
a
factor
leading
to
enhancement
in
the
sentence.
if
this
was
an
element
of
the
crime,
we
would
agree
with
you
that
the
initial
innocence
exception
applies
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
you
overruled
almendarez-torres,
we
would
agree
that
the
actual
innocence
exception
applies
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
but
again,
our
concern
is
with
broad
application
of
the
actual
innocence
exception
to
sentencing
and
to
the
many
findings
that
are
involved
there,
and
the
fact
is
that
the
court
hasn't
overruled
almendarez-torres.
we're
talking
about
even
in
this
case
just
an
erroneous
sentence.
we're
not
talking
about
an
innocence
of
an
offense
with
the
special
constitutional
status
that
that
entails
and
the
special
stigma
that's
attached
to
innocent,
to
an
offense.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it...
there's...
there's
certain
unfairness
involved,
but
the...
the
manifesting
justice
exception
is
not
directed
at...
at
every--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--at
every
unfairness,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i...
it...
what
the
court
has
done
in...
in
determining
the
application
of
exception
is
to
weigh
the...
the
degree
of
injustice
that
would
be
involved
in
denying
review
against
the
substantial
costs
involved
in...
in
reviewing
claims
when
there's...
the
prisoners
inexcusably
failed
to
raise
them
in
the
proper
forum
and
the
proper
time,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i...
your
honor,
the...
the...
it...
it's
certainly
an
unfairness,
but
there
are
substantial
costs
to...
to
extending
it
to
these
many...
there
are
many
factors
that
are
involved
in
sentencing,
and
the
fact
is
the
prisoner's
still
guilty
of
the
offense
of
conviction
here,
your
honor.
