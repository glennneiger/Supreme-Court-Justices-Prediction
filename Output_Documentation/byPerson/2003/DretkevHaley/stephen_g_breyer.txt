justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
go
to
that
first
and
tell
them
to
do
that,
because
this
is
just
very
difficult,
that
that
would
be
the
reason?
the
reason
it
would
be
difficult
is
because
actual
innocence
is
simply
a
way
at
getting
at
manifest
injustice,
i
think,
and
a
reason
that
this
fits
in
the
manifest
injustice
is
we
feel
differently
about
substantive
laws
that
govern
how
long
a
person
is
going
to
be
in
prison
than
we
do
about
procedural
laws,
and
sentencing
is
an
aspect
of
that.
but
if
you
take
that
and
say,
look,
this
is
an
absolute
obvious
case
where
there
was
just
wrong
sentencing,
it's
not
actual
innocence,
it's
wrong
sentencing,
but
it's
so
obvious,
it's
so
clear
that
this
is
just
unjust.
once
we're
down
that
path,
i
mean,
how
do
we
draw
a
line
between
that
and
every
sentencing
error?
now,
i'm
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
getting
you
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
that's
just
what
you
were
going
to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
but
is
the
answer
then
not
to
deal
with
it
when
it's
clear?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
it
would
be
wise
to
send
it
back,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
other
could
be,
couldn't
it?
i
mean,
that's...
what
i
don't
understand
about
this
area,
and
you've
read
the
cases
and
so
you
may
able
to
be
clearer
than
i
am
and
can
correct
me,
i've
thought
that
the
real
key
concept
is
not
actual
innocence.
it's
very
hard
to
apply
that
to
a
sentence.
you're
guilty
of
the
crime,
you're
not
innocent
of
the
sentence.
that
doesn't
make
sense,
but
rather
manifest
injustice,
and
the
key
word
is
manifest.
and
so
one
could
have
manifest
injustice
in
millions
of
possible
situations.
you
don't
need
absolute
clarity
as
to
it
applies
to
in
between
the
guideline
but
not
beyond
the
guideline,
but
the
key
word
is
manifest,
and
it
has
to
be
unjust
and
injustice
first
and
foremost
has
to
do
with
being
behind
bars
when
the
law
says
you
shouldn't
be,
directly
and
simply,
not
through
some
procedural
device.
so
thinking
about
it
in
that
way,
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
what
cases
of
this
court
stand
as
obstacles
to
the
way
i'm
thinking
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see
what
i...
what
i'm
basically
interested
in
is,
is
the...
the
concept
actual
innocence
simply
a
subdivision
of
the
broader
concept
manifest
injustice?
and
so
that
actual
innocence
of
the
crime
itself,
where
manifest,
is
a
basis
for
doing
whatever
happens
in
habeas
law.
and
if
i
know
whether
that's
a
subdivision,
i
then
would
have
a
better
handle
on
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everybody's
going
to
say
they're
actually
innocent.
all...
i
mean,
you
know,
not
everybody,
but,
you
know,
a
very
high
percentage
of
prisoners
in
prison
say,
i
was
actually
innocent,
and
the
prosecution
says,
no,
you're
not
actually
innocent.
so
if
that's
really
an
excuse,
actual
innocence,
and
if
in
fact
that's
really
an
excuse
in
respect
to
a
sentence,
then
why
wouldn't
every
case
be
open
to
the
federal
habeas
judge
relitigating
the
lawfulness
of
the
conviction
in
terms
of
the
evidence
and
relitigating
the
sentence
in
terms
of
what
was
reasonable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
in
your
view,
under
the
true
facts,
a
prisoner
says
the
true
facts
are
x,
the
state
says
the
true
facts
are
not
x,
and
what's
supposed
to
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
in
your...
in
your
view,
every
crime
in
a
state
court
and
every
sentence
in
a
state
court,
at
least
a
big
subset,
are
open
to
relitigation
in
the
federal
court
on
the
standard
of
whether
there
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
adds
the
factual
matters,
it
was
that
the...
the
state
court
was
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
this
guideline
says
the
statute
says,
judge,
you
must
apply
the
guideline
range
unless.
now,
there
are
many
situations
where
it
isn't
even
arguably
unless,
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
means
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
that
the
judge
impose
the
guideline
sentence,
four
extra
units
or
points
if
you
had
a
gun,
say.
the
prisoner
says,
i
didn't
have
a
gun.
the
state
says,
i
did
have
a
gun.
and
now
you
want
to
relitigate
whether
he
had
a
gun
or
didn't
have
a
gun,
whether
the
victim
was
seriously
hurt
or
only
gravely
hurt,
whether
there
was
a
threat
or
a
brandishment
or
an
actual
use
of
the
gun,
all
of
which
add
points,
and
what
you're
saying
is
all
of
those
things
would
be
relitigated
in
a
habeas
court,
as
long
as
the
prisoner
colorably
can
say,
i
have
evidence
that
will
show
clearly
and
convincingly
the
judge
was
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
you
were
saying
that,
but
judge...
i
knew
you
were
saying
that,
but
i
think
justice
scalia's
question
was
that
he
can't
find,
nor
can
i
find,
a
logical
basis
for
making
that
distinction.
that's
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
can
i...
i
just...
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
yourself
concede
he
shouldn't
be
in
jail
under
the
substantive
law
of
texas,
and
it
is
a
case
where
you
yourself
agree
there
is
a
very
big
claim
that
the
lawyer
was
incompetent.
if
we
send
this
texas,
is
texas
going
to
move
to
revoke
his
bail?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
out
while
it's
being
litigated?
