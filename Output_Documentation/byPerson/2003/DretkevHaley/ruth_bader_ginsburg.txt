justice

and
not
raise
any
procedural
impediment
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the...
the...
another
feature
of
this
case,
what
makes
it
so
disturbing,
is
that
the
initial
error
was
the
prosecutor
in...
when
the
prosecutor
indicted
him,
that
indictment
was
incorrect,
and
then
the
rest
followed,
relying
on
that
original
mistake
of
the
prosecutor.
so
it
seems
a...
really
an
ideal
case
for
the
prosecution
to
say,
we
missed
it,
and
then
as
a
result
of
we...
what
we,
the
prosecutor
missed,
the
court
missed
it,
defense
counsel
missed
it,
but
it
was
our
error
and
we
should
correct
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
defendant
certainly
raised...
he
raised
the
point
in
his
pro
se
petition
in
the
state
court
and
he
raised
it
in
the
federal
court,
the
ineffective
assistance,
but
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
prosecutor
suggest
that
maybe
the
court
should
have
dealt
with
it,
because
neither
court
gave
any
reason
for
rejecting
that
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
court
views
this
as
a
preliminary
question,
a
question
that
the
fifth
circuit
and
any
other
federal
court
should
have
reached
logically
before
it
reached
the
question
on
which
it
decided
the
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
we
should
put
the
court
back
in
the
position
that
it
should
have
been
in
if
it
handled
the
case
correctly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
one
of
the
proceedings,
texas
did
take
the
position
that
there...
this
was
not
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
reply
brief
i
think
makes
it
clear
that
you're
not
disputing
that
the...
that
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
is
alive
and
well.
but
there
was
a
time
you
took
a
different
view.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
you
now
say
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
i
think
you
answered
that
that
was
preserved.
but
i
noticed
that
you
were
very
careful
in
your
brief
to
say
twice
if...
if
haley
preserved
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
albritton,
there's...
there's
one
misfit
here.
you...
you're
trying
to
transpose
to
the
sentencing
area
the
actual
innocence
of
the
crime,
precedent
from
the
death
penalty
area.
but
this
court
has
said
in
herrera
that
the
actual
innocence,
first
it
has
to
be
new
evidence,
and
second,
that
it's
only
a
gateway.
and
you
say,
well,
sure,
it's
only
a
gateway
here,
the
gateway
is
jackson,
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
but
the
very
same
thing
that
proves
the
actual
innocence
of
the
sentence
is
what
establishes
that
you
win
on
the
constitutional
point.
and
in
the...
in
the
death
cases,
there
isn't
that...
this
is
not
overlap,
this
is
total
coincidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
has
been
the...
the
experience
in
the
circuits
that
have
adopted
this
rule
applying
the
actual
innocence
to
sentencing?
there
are
two
circuits,
aren't
there?
