justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
also
very
clear
that
he's
going
to
spend
over
10
year
in
jail
when
he
shouldn't
spend
10
years
in
jail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but...
but
if
the
law
were
followed
and
everything
went
perfectly,
he
would
spend
less
than
2
or...
what
is
it,
2
or
3
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he's
going
to
spend
16
years
in
jail,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
is
that
just,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
you
want
to
preserve
the
procedures,
but
do
you
think
justice
is
being
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
always
thought
there
was
a
manifest
injustice
exception
to
the
procedural
default
rule,
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
concedes
there
was
injustice
at
the
end
of
their
brief.
they
say
it's
less
significant,
it's
a
less...
qualitatively
less
significance
than
if
you
put
an
innocent
man
to
death.
but
is
it
not
manifest
that
there
was
injustice
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
when
manifest
injustice
would
exist
other
than
a
death
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
is
there
any...
any
content
to
the
manifest
injustice
exception
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
give
me
an
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he's
innocent
of
the
crime
he's
in...
in
prison
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
the
law
were
followed,
he
would
have
been
released
a
long
time
ago,
would
he
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
narrow
circumstances,
when
the
record
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
an
error
has
been
committed
and
an
innocent
person
is
in
jail,
that's...
what
more
do
you
need?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
aren't
many
cases
like
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
usually
the
valid
claim
is
some
procedural
error
in
the
trial,
something
of
that
character.
it's
not
that
he's
totally
innocent
and
everybody
agrees
he's
totally
innocent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it's
a
lesser
injustice
if
he's
really
guilty
of
the
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
is
not
guilty
of
what
he's
in
prison
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
think
the
3
days
is
an
argument
that
has
any
merit.
you'd
make
the
same
argument
if
it
was
10
years.
you'd
make
the
same
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
could
deliberately
refuse
to
do
it
in
order
to
trap
the
state
into
some
kind
of
mistake,
is
this
a
case
of,
you
know,
in
our
original
case
that
we
talk
about
gamesmanship
and
so
on,
do
you
think
this
is
gamesmanship
on
his
part?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
the
counsel
sandbagged
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
16-year
sentence
instead
of
a
3-year
sentence,
doesn't
that
demonstrate
that
he
was
incompetent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
involve
all
those
costs
if
we
can
find
the
exception
to
cases
in
which
the
state
acknowledges
the
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
problematic
if
we
limit
it
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
why
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
is
this
qualitatively
different
from
the
rule
in
jackson
against
virginia
that
if
there's
no
evidence
to
support
the
conviction,
we
set
it
aside,
then
you
presume
the
guy's
innocent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
when
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
one
of
the
elements
hasn't
been
proved,
why
he
had
a...
why
isn't
it
the
same
here?
the
record
establishes
that
one
of
the
elements
necessary
for
this
conviction
has
not
been
proven,
the
order
of
the...
the
two
crimes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
roberts,
aren't
we
talking
about
justice?
you...
at
the
end
of
your
brief
you
say,
this
is
qualitatively
less
significant
than
it...
than
killing
somebody
for
the
wrong
crime,
but
it
is
injust,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
manifest
injustice--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
it's
a...
it's
a...
it's
directed
at
injustice
that
is
manifest,
not
the
disqualitatively
more
than
severe
than
it,
and
here
it's
manifest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
and
there
are
also
cases
under
feretta
where
the
defendant
decides
to
represent
himself.
