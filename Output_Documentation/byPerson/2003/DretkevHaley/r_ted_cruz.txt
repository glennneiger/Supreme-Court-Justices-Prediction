mr.
r.
ted
cruz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
continuing
vitality
of
the
procedural
default
rule,
an
important
bulwark
to
federalism,
comity,
and
finality
of
judgments.
this
court
has
consistently
maintained
that
cause
and
prejudice
can
address
problems
with
procedural
default,
and
that
the
actual
innocence
exception
should
be
applicable
only
in
exceedingly
rare
cases.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
no,
justice
kennedy,
but
the
state
is
here,
because
the
state
is
concerned
about
the
impact
on
the
procedural
default
rule,
in
particular
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
implicit
in
the
procedural
default--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--implicit
in
the
procedural
default
rule
is
the
premise
that
petitioner
has
a
valid
claim.
in...
in
some
ways
this
case,
as
the
fifth
circuit
remarked,
as
the
judges
dissenting
from
denial
of
rehearing
en
banc,
in
some
ways
this
case
presents
an
usually
pristine
form,
i
mean,
it's
almost
a
law
school
hypothetical,
because
the
error
is
so
clean.
there's
a
3-day
disparity--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
that
is
inherent
in
any
claim
with
procedural
default.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it
is
very
clear
that
there
was
an
error,
and
that
if
mr.
haley
had
raised
the
error
at
trial,
that
the
trail
judge
would
have
and
should
have
sustained--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
is
clear
that
he
will
spend
10
years
in
jail
when
he
had
an
objection
he
could
have
raised
that
he
did
not.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
two
years
would
be
the
max.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
maintaining
the
procedural
default
rule
is--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
think
justice
is
being
done
because
he
had
a
full
and
fair
trial
and
an
opportunity
to
raise
his
errors,
and
there's
no
greater--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
there
is
a
very
strong
argument
that
there
was
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
is
something
that
is
open
to
the
court
to
do
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
with
what
the
district
court
did.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
there
is
an
argument
that
it
was
waived,
but
i
think
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
could
certainly
deem
the
petitioner's
pleading
sufficient
to
preserve
that
claim.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if
it's
sent
back,
we
would
be
prepared
to
address
the
ineffective
assistance
claim
on
its
merits.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and,
justice
ginsburg,
this
case
may
well,
if
the
court
finds
ineffective
assistance,
that
would
suffice
to
correct
this,
because
ineffective
assistance
counts
as
cause,
and
in
many
ways
this
case
illustrates
why
cause
and
prejudice
is
ample
to
address
error
in
sentencing
in
non-capital
sentencing
and
why
there's
not
a
need
to
open
the
door
to
a
new
category
of
exceptions
to
procedural
default.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the...
the
claim
was
denied
in
state
habeas
and
the
federal
habeas
court
did
not
address
it
because
it
had
already
granted
relief
based
upon
his
claim
that
he
was
actually
innocent
of
the
sentence.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i...
the...
the
district
court
jumped
ahead
in
the
process.
rather
than
address
cause
and
prejudice,
the
district
court
said
that
it
didn't
need
to
address
cause
and
prejudice
because
it
found
actual
innocence,
and
that's
one
of
the...
the
significant
problems,
much
like
statutory
interpretation,
where
a
court
should--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
scalia,
the
first
preference
of
the
state
of
texas
is
for
the
court
to
address
the
circuit
split
and
to
clarify
that
there
is
no
actual
innocence
exception
to
non-capital
sentencing.
if
the
court
is
not
inclined
to
do
so,
the
state
of
texas,
our
second
preferred
outcome
is
to
vacate
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
so
we
don't
operate
under
that
precedent.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and
texas
is
not
urging
the
court
not
to
decide
it.
it
is
simply
saying
that
is
an
avenue
should
the
court
decide
to
decide...
to
rule
on
this
case
in
a
more
narrow
ground,
that
is
an
avenue
that
would
provide
some
relief
to
texas
because
it
would
vacate
the
fifth
circuit
decision
and
it
would
allow
ultimately
for
some
relief
for
mr.
haley
as
well.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
or
perhaps
someone
else
would
fight
in
a
different
circuit.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
yes,
justice--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
ginsburg,
we
certainly
agree
that
as
a
matter
of
thinking
through
procedural
default,
that
courts
should
begin
with
cause
and
prejudice,
that
the
actual
innocence
exception
as
a
potential
trump
card
should
not
be
jumped
to
first.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--and,
justice
scalia,
i
agree
entirely
with
your
characterization
of
the
errors
made
by
the
court
below.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
stevens,
i...
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
it...
it
is
manifest
that
there
was
error--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--there
are
a
host
of
instances
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
actual
constitutional
errors
should
nonetheless
not
be
addressed
because
the
defendant
has
procedurally
defaulted
that.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
absolutely
there
is.
the
paradigmatic
case--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--is
an
individual
was
is
innocent
of
the
crime.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
he
is
innocent
only
in
the
most
technical
of
legal
sense.
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word,
he
committed
the
theft,
he
committed
the
predicate
felonies--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--if
he
had
raised
his
objection.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
he
was
charged
with
theft,
and
that
was
enhanced
to
a
state
jail
felony
because
he
had
committed
two
prior
thefts.
and
then
upon
sentencing,
his
sentence
was
aggravated
because
he
was
a
habitual
offender
and
had
two
prior
felony
convictions.
now,
the
indictment
alleged
that
they
were
sequential
and
it
turned
out
that
allegation
was
incorrect.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
no,
actually,
justice
scalia,
the
way
the
statute
reads--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it's
a
3...
it's
a
3-day
disparity.
the
first
crime
was
delivery
of
amphetamines.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and
he
committed
that
in
1988,
but
that
conviction
did
not
become
final
until
october
18th,
1991.
three
days
before
october
18th,
1991,
he
committed
attempted
robbery,
and
the
way
the
texas
statute
reads,
he
has
to
commit
the
second
felony
after
the
first
felony
conviction
becomes
final.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it...
it
did.
i
don't
know
the
extent
to
which
that
was
discovery
in
the
trial,
but
that...
that's
ultimately
what
the
record
reveal
in
terms
of
when
that
conviction--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--absolutely,
absolutely.
and...
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
state
has
an
obligation
to
be
candid
with
the
court,
so
at
any
point
in
which
the
state
became
aware
of
this
error,
the
state
would
be
obliged
to
inform
the
court,
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
procedural
default,
when
the
defendant
has
not
preserved
his
error,
that
the
state
should
not
act
to
vindicate
that
procedural
default.
there
is
an
important
value
in
protecting
the
procedural
rules
in
the
state
of
texas,
and
that
value
is
not
served.
i
mean,
ultimately,
this
court
has
said
that
the
very
narrow
exception
of
actual
innocence
should
apply
in
very
narrow
circumstances.
so
this
court
has
ultimately
engaged
in
a
balancing,
a
balancing
that
derives
from
prior
language
in
the...
in
the
federal
habeas--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
difficult--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
is
true
that
there
are
not
many
cases
where
the
state
concedes
error,
but
the
difficulty
with
pivoting
the
test
on
that
is
the
basic
operating
premise
of
every
habeas
petition.
where
procedural
default
is
raised
is
that
the
petitioner
has
valid
claim
and
this
court
has
not
hesitated
to
allow
far
more
significant
claims
not
to
be
addressed
because
of
procedural
default.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
this...
this
court
has
addressed
procedural
default
in
the
context
of
forced
confessions,
in
the
context
of
statements
without
miranda
rights,
in
the
context
of
psychiatry--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
do
not
have
any
cases
like
that,
but
that
aspect
simply
goes
to
prejudice,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
cautioned
that
the
actual
innocence
exception
should
not
be
used
to
transform
cause
and
prejudice
just
to
prejudice.
there's
no
doubt
that
this
error
caused
prejudice.
the
only
question
is
if
there
was
cause
for
not
raising
it,
and
in
terms
of
asking...
i
mean,
justice
stevens
asked
me
about,
is
this
a
manifest
injustice.
there
seems
nothing
on
the
face
of
it
that
is
plain
to
me
that
allowing
an
individual
to
be
convicted
and
to
remain
convicted
and
serve
in
jail
or
even
be
executed
based
on
a
forced
confession
is
somehow
a
lesser
injustice
than
allowing
mr.
haley
to
serve
a
sentence--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
in
this
case,
mr.
haley
is
guilty
of
the
theft,
he's
guilty
of
the
predicate
offense--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--only
in
the
sense--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
is...
it
is
true
that
3
days
or
5
days
or
whatever
does
not
matter.
what
matters,
and
what
we
are
urging,
is
that
mr.
haley
had
multiple
avenues
to
challenge
this.
he
could
have
challenged
this
at
trial.
he
could
have
challenged
this
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
you
know,
we
don't
have
reason
to
suggest
that
mr.
haley
in
this
instance
was
engaged
in
gamesmanship
with
respect
to
this
error,
but
the
record
is
susceptible
to
an
interpretation
that
his
counsel
was
engaged
in
gamesmanship
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
mr.
haley
pleaded
to
the
enhancements.
because
what
happened
at
trial
is
mr.
haley's
attorney
urged
the
trial
court,
my
client
doesn't
want
to
plead,
please
go
ahead,
he's
not
going
to
plead.
the
trial
court
did
what
the
counsel
asked
and
he
immediately,
on
direct
appeal
that
was
his
principal
challenge,
and
that
is
one
possible
interpretation
of
the
record
is
the
counsel
was
attempting
to
sandbag.
there
was
a
line
of
state
court
cases
saying
it
was
mandatory
error
not
to
plead.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it
may
well,
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
urge
that
counsel
engaged
in
good
strategic
decisions,
but
it
may
have
been
a
strategic
decision
with
respect
to
urging
the
court
to
commit
an
error
under
state
law
that
caused
the
counsel
not
to
notice
the
disparities
in
the
enhancements.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that...
that
is
correct,
and
we
agree
at
this
point
there
is
a
very
significant
argument
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
i
would
note
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
texas
has
found
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
almost
precisely
the
same
circumstance
where
a
counsel
failed
to
notice
the
non-sequential
nature
of
felonies
used
to
enhance
a
habitual
offender
in
the
decision
of
ex
parte
scott,
which
is
found
at
581
sw
2d
181.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that...
that's...
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
may
well
frequently
be
the
case,
which
is
why
you
wouldn't
need
the
actual
innocence
exception
for
that...
for
that
circumstance.
but...
but
our
concern
is
that
a
rule
that
applies
to
the
exception
where
the
prisoner
is
guilty
of
the
crime
and
is
claiming
only
that
he's
suffering
an
excessive
prison
term,
if
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion,
that
would
open
up
final
judgments
where
a
criminal
defendant
is
belatedly
claiming
that
a
sentencing
guideline
was
incorrectly
applied
to
him
and
that
he's
therefore
innocent
of
the
sentence.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
quickly
revisit
an
exchange
justice
scalia
had
with
mr.
albritton
concerning
almendarez-torres,
and
make
the
point
that
even
if
this
court
were
at
some
future
date
to
decide
to
overrule
almendarez-torres,
which
i
don't
believe
is
presented
in
this
case,
that
would
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
actual
innocence
exception
would
extend
to
non-capital
sentencing.
the
inquiries
are
altogether
different.
the
former,
what
was
at...
the
case
at
common
law
at
the
time
of
the
founding.
the
latter
is,
as
the
exchange
illuminated,
a
question
of
what
28
u.s.c.
section
2254
provides.
and
i
would
note
2255,
with
respect
to
federal
habeas,
explicitly
includes
in
its
statutory
text
as
one
of
the
grounds
for
granting
habeas
that
a
sentence
is,
quote,
in
excess
of
the
maximum
authorized
by
law.
that's
in
2255.
it
is
not
in
2254.
the
only
ground
for
granting
habeas
in
2254
with
respect
to
a
state
conviction
is
if
someone
is
held
in
custody
of
violation
of
the
laws
or
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
so
it
is
altogether
possible
that
this
court
could
decide
at
some
future
date
to...
to
overrule
almendarez-torres
and
then
yet
nonetheless
decide
that
in
looking
to
the
ends
of
justice
that
now
repeal
language
from
the
habeas
statute,
that
there
is
not
an
obligation
to
excuse
procedural
default
for
every
single
conceivable
sentencing
error.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the...
the
state
is
willing
to
allow
the
ineffective
assistance
case
to
be
litigated
before
proceeding
to
reincarcerate
mr.
haley,
so
we
will
wait
until
that...
that
claim
is
resolved
before...
before--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--he...
he
is
out
right
now
and
the
state
will
leave
him
out
until
his
claim
is
resolved
with
respect
to
that.
with
respect
to
the
balance,
which
is...
which
is
ultimately
how
this
court
has
analyzed
the
actual
innocence
exception,
on
the
one
side
i
would
submit
there
is
very
limited
need
for
extending
the
actual
innocence
exception
to
non-capital
sentencing.
cause
and
prejudice
can
address
situations
where
relief
is
merited,
such
as
perhaps
mr.
haley's.
on
the
other
side,
there
is
the
risk
of
expanding
that.
non-capital
sentencing,
unlike
actual
innocence,
i
didn't
do
it,
of
the
crime,
unlike
actual
innocence
of
death,
non-capital
sentencing
is
virtually
ubiquitous.
interestingly,
mr.
haley's
amici
law
professors
in
footnote
13
of
their
brief
acknowledge
the
ability
of
the
slippery
slope
to
extend
beyond
just
increasing
the
statutory
maximum
to
sentences
within
a
range
and
to
a
whole
host
of
factors
that
the
states
used
for
sentencing
factors,
facts...
factors
such
as
the
amount
of
drugs,
such
as
the
value
of
stolen
goods,
such
as
the
status
of
a
victim,
whether
the
victim
is
elderly,
whether
the
victim
is
a
police
officer.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
there
have
been
relatively
few
cases
that
have
come
up
since
those
decisions,
but
i
would
note
first
of
all
we
don't
know
what
unpublished
decisions
are
out
there,
and
secondly,
there's
a
significant
difference
between
a
circuit
decision
allowing
an
exception
and
a
decision
of
this
court.
