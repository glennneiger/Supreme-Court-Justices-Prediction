justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can...
can
you
tell
me...
i
don't
want
to
derail
the
argument...
you've
conceded
that
this
sentence
is
unlawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
why
are
you
here?
don't...
is
there
some
rule
that
you
can't
confess
error
in
your
state
or?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
a
man
does
15
years
so
you
can
vindicate
your
legal
point
in
some
other
case?
i...
i
just
don't
understand
why
you
don't
dismiss
this
case
and
move
to
lower
the
sentence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'd
say
the
same
for
the
government
of
the
united
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at...
at
the
prisoner's
expense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a...
as
if
there's
some
new
trial
and...
and
it's
in
doubt.
it's
very
clear
he
should
not
be
in
jail
for,
like
what,
12,
14,
15
more
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at...
at
trial,
do
you
think
the
prosecutor
would
have,
if
he
had
noted
this
error,
have
the
duty
to
call
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
before
the
trial
judge
imposed
sentence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
trial
obligation...
the
trial
lawyer's
obligation
to
do
justice
is...
is
somehow
missing
in
your
office?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose...
suppose
this
were
the
federal
system.
would
the
department
of
justice
take
the
position
that
it
would
not
ask
sua
sponte
that
this
sentence
be
reduced?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
there
might
be
some
doubt
that
the
department
of
justice
would
insist
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
10...
a
10-year...
an
unlawful
10-year
term?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
forget
cause
and
prejudice.
suppose
the
term
is
unlawful
and
it's
conceded
to
be
unlawful.
are
you
taking
the
position
the
department
of
justice
says
he
has
to
be
held
anyway?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm...
i'm
astounded
by
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
have
difficulty
weighing
15
years
of
an
unlawful
sentence
and
saying
that
that's
not
a
manifest
injustice?
that's
a
difficult
exercise?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
and
what...
what's
your
authority
for
that?
where...
where
have
we
said
that?
is
that
part
of
your
submission
or
are
you
saying
that
that's
existing
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you
know
on
what
basis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
goes
back
to
the
almendarez-torres
discussion
you
had
with
justice
scalia?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's...
it's
a
little,
i
suppose,
patronizing
in...
in
some
sense
for
us
to
say
that
the
district
courts,
federal
courts
are
vindicating
texas'
interest
in
its
own
laws,
although
it's
pretty
obvious
texas
doesn't
care
about
it
in
this
case.
