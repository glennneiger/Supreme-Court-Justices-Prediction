mr.
eric
m.
albritton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
the...
the
systemic
concerns
that
underpin
the
procedural
default
doctrine
must
yield
to
the
imperative
of
correcting
a
fundamentally
unjust
incarceration,
and
incarceration
that
is
beyond
the
statutory
maximum
sentence,
whether
it
be
a
capital
sentence
or
a
non-capital
sentence,
is
fundamentally
unjust.
the
court
has
never
limited
this
exception
to
a
capital
sentence
context
and
it
should
not
do
so
today.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--your
honor,
i
agree
that
this
court's
precedents
suggest
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
cause
and
prejudice,
should
be
addressed
first.
however,
this
court
has
never
expressly
held
that.
your
honor,
in
relation
to
the
question
that
i've
been
asked
about,
should
this
court
just
remand
for
consideration
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
that
is
not
appropriate.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
petitioner--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--your
honor,
i
think
it
was
grossly
inadequate.
however,
the
question
presented
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
only
whether
the
actual
innocence
exception
to
the
procedural
default
rule
concerning
federal
habeas
corpus
claims
should
apply
to
non-capital
sentence
here.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
you
could,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
again,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that's
inappropriate.
the
state
of
texas
could
have
argued
and
presented
the
court
with
that
particular
question,
that
is,
whether
or
not
the
court
should
have
reached
cause
and
prejudice
first.
however,
the
state
of
texas
did
not
ask
the
court
to
consider
that
claim.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
your
honor,
i
am
familiar
with
that
precedent,
and
i
understand
that
the
court
could--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
state
didn't--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
if
it's
remanded,
he's
going
to
be
incarcerated
while
it
goes
back
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
through
the
district
court,
and
if
this
court
decides
that,
this
issue,
that
it
cannot
reach
the
issue
presented,
the
court
can
certainly
dismiss
this
case
as
improvidently
granted
and
mr.
haley
will
no
longer
have
to
suffer
under
the
danger
of
this
clearly--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
i
absolutely
would
not,
your
honor.
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
need
reach
almendarez-torres.
however,
the
rule
we
propose
is
certainly
consistent
with
this
court's
sixth
amendment
rule
in
apprendi.
it's
also
consistent
with--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--several
reasons,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
this
court's
decision
in
sawyer
v.
whitley
specifically
adopted
an
eligibility
test,
and
that
eligibility
test
draws
the
line
at
where
that
person
is
statutorily
eligible.
this
court
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
it
should
consider
discretionary
factors
in
the
capital
context
mitigating
evidence.
thus,
your
honor,
our
rule
about
statutory
eligibility
is
tethered
specifically
to
the
court's
ruling
in
sawyer.
additionally,
your
honor,
that
rule
that
we
propose
is
well-rooted
in
this
court's
habeas
doctrine
dating
back
to
townsend
v.
burke,
your
honor.
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
sentence
that
falls...
the
severity
of
a
sentence
that
falls
within
a
statutory
range
is
not
amenable
to
habeas
review.
additionally,
the
recent
case,
your
honor,
of
harris
v.
the
united
states,
where
the
issue
was
whether
apprendi
applied
to
mandatory
minimums.
this
court
held...
actually,
part
of
the
opinion
is
a
plurality
opinion,
but
the
holding
is
that
the...
it
does
not
matter
if
the
sentence
is
more
based
on
some
false
fact.
the
issue
is,
is
it
within
range
of
punishment
authorized
by
the
legislature,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
well,
your
honor,
the
difference
is
in
an
error
in
what
constitutes
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice,
and
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
when
a
sentence
is
imposed
outside
of
any
range
authorized
by
the
legislature,
that
is
fundamentally
unjust.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
your
honor,
i
believe
that
sawyer,
we
believe
that
sawyer
v.
whitley
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
that
approach,
because
in
sawyer,
your
honor,
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
factors
that
affect
the
sentence
within
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
body
are
not
to
be
considered
in
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
somebody...
or
a
petitioner
is
actually
innocent
of
that
sentence.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
your
honor,
i...
it
is
our
position
that
innocence
has
been
adopted
as
a
touchstone
for
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
manifest
injustice.
the
court
has
determined
that
that
properly
takes
into
consideration,
that
focus
on
innocence
takes
into
proper
consideration
the
systemic
interest
in
federalism,
comity,
and
finality.
your
honor,
although
the...
the
concept
of
innocence
of
punishment
is
awkward
and
recognized,
mr.
haley
is
actually
innocent
of
the
fact
alleged
that
caused
for
the
sentence
that
is
more
than
eight
times
the
statutory--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--those
concerns,
your
honor,
underpin
the
reason
for
the
high
standard
of
proof
in
the
first
instance,
that
is,
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
those
concerns
also,
your
honor,
inform
the
reason
for
the
rule
we
proposed,
and
that
is
there
is
only
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
when
a
sentence
is
imposed
that
under
the
true
facts
no
sentencing
body,
judge
or
jury,
could
have
ever
done.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
the
court
has
to
decide
if
the
petitioner
has
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
or
she,
but
for
a
constitutional
violation,
would
not
have
been
eligible
for
that
sentence.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
no,
your
honor,
not
a
large
subset,
only
the
subset
of
cases
where
the
petitioner
receives
a
sentence
for
which
he
or
she
is
statutorily
ineligible.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
that's
not
actually
entirely
accurate,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
in
the...
in
the
federal
context,
your
honor,
there
are
two
things
that
are
operating.
one
are
the
guidelines,
but
the
second
is
the
statutory
range
of
punishment.
the
legislature
has
determined
that
within
the
application
of
the
guidelines,
that
a
sentence,
up
until
and
including
the
statutory
maximum
under
some
circumstances
is
appropriate.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
under
the
rule
we
propose,
the
federal
court
would
only
have
to
engage
in
this
exercise
if
the
petitioner
could
establish
by
the
requisite
proof
that
he
or
she
received
a
sentence
above
the
statutory
maximum.
while
it
may
be
error
in
the
application
of
the
guidelines
and
there
can
be
factual
inaccuracies--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--your...
your
honor,
the
difference
between
unlawful
and
a
fundamentally
unjust
is
an
important
distinction.
as
this
court
has
historically
held
from
the
early
notions
of
habeas
when,
even
when
habeas
review
in
the
first
right,
regardless
of
default,
was
much
more
circumspect,
the
court
could
always
reach
and
always
issue
the
writ
where
a
petitioner
received
a
sentence
that
is
outside
the
statutory
range.
so
it's
a
difference
in
the...
a
situation
where
there
may
be
an
error
and
there
may
be
some
injustice,
and
a
situation
where
the...
the
injustice
is
fundamental,
your
honor.
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
your
honor,
in
this
court's
opinion
last
week
in
banks
v.
dretke,
the
court
recognized,
as
it
had
previously
in
stickler
v.
greene...
strickler
v.
greene,
that
it
is
not
unusual
for
the
same
facts
to
be
used
and
an
overlap
between
those
facts
for
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
the
merits
of
the
claim
can
be
reached
and
the
merits
of
the
claim.
as
the
court
held
in
banks
last
week,
your
honor,
the...
the
same
evidence
was
used
to
establish
both
cause
and
prejudice,
as
well
as
the
underlying
merits
of
the...
of
the
brady
violation.
it's
not
surprising
that
the
same
evidence
would
be
involved
in
this
situation,
your
honor,
because,
after
all,
the
inquiry
is
extremely
similar,
and
that
is
the
innocence
of
the
petitioner
and
whether
or
not
the
state
proved
as
a
due
process
matter
the
allegations
that
it
was
required
to.
your
honor,
this...
this
rule
is
a
narrow
rule
for
the
reasons
we
discussed.
it
does
not
reach
the
sentencing
guideline
issues.
this
holding
under
apprendi...
under...
this
court's
holding
in
apprendi,
your
honor,
requires
all
elements
other
than
arguably
some
or
some
recidivist
allegations
under
almendarez-torres
are
required
to
be
alleged
and
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
so
that
if
a
person
is
charged
with
a
drug
offense
and
the
difference
in
50
grams
and
51
grams
affects
the
statutory
maximum,
his
or
her
actual
innocence
of
that
quantity
is
already
covered
subject
to...
subject...
is
already
subject
to
the
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
irrespective
of
what
the
court
holds
in
the
application
of
sawyer
to
non-capital
sentences.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
your
honor,
that's...
first
of
all,
i
believe,
your
honor,
the
government
just
conceded
that.
secondly,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--yes,
sir.
this
court
has
held
in
schlup--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--that
if
you're
actually
innocent
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
then...
and
you're
able
to
establish
that...
then
the
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
applies.
if
the
quantity
of
cocaine
is
an
element
of
the
offense
for
apprendi
purposes--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--the
failure
to...
the
innocence
of
that
fact
would
make
the
petitioner
subject
to
the--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--your
honor,
it...
no,
sir,
it
does
not,
because
almendarez-torres
only
concerns
certain
recidivist
allegations.
apprendi
applies
to
every
other
factors
that
raises--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--the
statutory
maximum.
your
honor,
this
rule
can...
the
exception
that
we're
talking
about
can
be
administered
with
relative
ease.
as
the
court
discussed
in
sawyer,
that's
an
important
consideration
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
exception
should
be
applied.
the
issue
presented
to
a
federal
district
judge
of
actual
innocence
of
a
non-capital
sentence
is
easier
to
determine
and
it's
more
objective
than,
for
instance,
the
determination
federal
district
judges
are
called
upon
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
petitioner
is
statutorily
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
for
instance,
in
the
state
of
texas,
the
state
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
petitioner
constitutes
a
future
danger.
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
for
instance,
the
state
has
to...
one
of
the
statutory
aggravating
factors
are
that
the
crime
was
committed
in
a
heinous
manner.
those
inquiries
are
more
subjective
and
less
objective
than
the
inquiry
required
under
the
application
the...
of
the
exception
that
we
propose.
additionally,
your
honors,
the
equities
weigh
strongly
in
favor
of
applying
the
rule
in
non-capital
sentences.
justice
scalia
asked
a
question
as
to
why
this
rule
may
be
necessary
because
there
would
always
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
frankly
there's
an
answer
to
that.
and
that
answer
is,
there
will
not
always
be
a
meritorious...
under
a
meritorious
claim
and
there
will
not
necessarily
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
for
one
reason
at
least,
and
that
is,
under
carrier,
this
court
held
that
to
rely
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
as
cause
in
federal
court,
that
claim
had
to
have
been
raised
below
in
the
state
court.
so
there
could
be
a
scenario,
this
scenario,
if
mr.
haley
had
not
properly
raised
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
below
in
state
habeas
or
on
state
appeal
as
required
by
state
law,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
rely
on
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
for
cause
in
federal
court,
and
so
the
court
would
be
presented
again
with
this
fundamentally
unjust
situation.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
your
honor,
what
is
unusual
about
this
case
additionally,
as
pointed
out
by
the
court,
the
prosecutors...
we're...
we
don't
suggest
purposefully...
but
the
prosecutors
nevertheless
caused
the
injustice
in
this
case.
the
state
of
texas
prop...
improperly
alleged
that
mr.
haley's
second
conviction
or
second
prior
offense
was
committed
before...
or
after
the
first
became
final.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
a
prosecutor
in
good
faith
could
certainly
believe
that
the
evidence
would
be
sufficient
to
prove
future
dangerousness
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--even
if
the
prosecutor
did
not
do
this
intentionally,
your
honor,
the
error
and
the
injustice
originated
with
the
prosecutor.
not
only
did
the
prosecutor--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--if
future
dangerousness
is
alleged,
in
reviewing
the
evidence
there's
a
good
faith
belief
to
believe
that
there...
that
person
constitutes
a
future
danger,
that
would
be
different
than
in
this
situation
where
all
the
prosecutor
had
to
do
was
look
at
its
state's
exhibit
number
6,
your
honor,
and
read
the
dates.
the
prosecutor
could
have
discerned--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--absolutely,
and
he
should
have,
your
honor.
additionally,
your
honor,
one
of
the...
the
reasons
for
the
narrow
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
is
this
notion
of
gamesmanship,
and
as
pointed
out
in
the
briefs,
it
is
our
position
that
there
would
never
be
any
rational
incentive
for
a
petitioner
to
engage
in
gamesmanship
when
there
was
conclusive
evidence
that
established
he
or
she
was
not
statutorily
eligible
for
the
sentence.
mr.
haley's
case
is
a
perfect
example.
even
though
mr.
haley
was
diligent
and
filed
his
state
writ
very
shortly
after
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
texas
denied
discretionary
review,
he's
ended
up
spending
4
years
more
in
prison
than
he
was
even
authorized
for
under
the
statute.
additionally,
your
honor,
in
discussing
the
state's
interest
in
this
case,
it
is
the
federal
habeas
court
that
in
actuality
is
vindicating
the
texas
substantive
law.
now
that
does
not
mean,
of
course,
that
there
is
no
interest
of
the
state
in
its
procedural
laws.
however,
that
recognition
indicates
that,
in
effect,
there's
a
wash
of
the
interest
here,
which
would
not
undermine
the
application
of
the
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
in
this
context.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
certainly
the...
the
state
doesn't
seem
to
care
about
that
interest
with
its
position
here.
however,
i
don't
think
it's...
we
do
not
think
it's
patronizing,
your
honor,
because
the
court
is
always
required
to
balance
the
equities
of
the
situation
and
determine
whether
the
exception
to
the
procedural
default
rule
should
apply.
and
in
this
case,
we
think
that
it
is
quite
relevant
that
you're
discussing...
and
it
would
be
so
in
all
cases
such
as
this
that,
under
the
rule
we
propose,
because
the
sentence
would
always
be
outside
the
range
authorized
the
legislature
for
this
particular
conduct.
your
honors,
in
relation,
briefly
here
at
the
end
to
almendarez-torres,
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
if
almendarez-torres
does
not
control,
then
this
case
is...
is
very
easy
and
there
need
not
be
any
application
of
sawyer,
and
that
is
because,
as
i
said
earlier,
he
would
be
actually
innocent
of
the
enhanced
offense
of
theft
by
habitual
offender.
as
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
almendarez-torres
is
not
controlling
because
in
this
case
there
is
an
additional...
there
is
something
else
that
must
be
proven
in
addition
to
the
fact
of
the
prior
convictions,
and
that
is
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
second
prior
felony
offense.
for
that
reason--
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
--your
honor,
the
state
of
texas
in
its
judgment
specifically
required
not
only
the...
in
this
circumstance,
not
only
the
existence
of
two
prior
felony
convictions,
but
that
the
second
was
committed
after,
excuse
me,
the
conviction
of
the
first.
mr.
eric
m.
albritton
that...
that
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
what
we
allege
is
that
it
is
not
the
focus
on
the
sequence
of
the
convictions.
when
sequence
is
used,
it
is
shorthand
to
describe
the...
when
the
second
offense
was
committed,
and
the
date
of
commission
of
that
offense
is
something
separate
and
apart
from
the
fact
of
those
prior...
of
that
prior
conviction.
so,
your
honor,
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
takes
this
outside
of
almendarez-torres,
and
therefore
the
court
can...
can
determine
that
mr.
haley
is
actually
innocent
of
the
enhanced
offense
of
theft
by
habitual
offender.
finally,
your
honor,
in
conclusion,
i
would
respectfully
request
the
court
not
to
remand
to
the
state
of
texas...
excuse
me,
to
the
courts
below,
unless
it
reaches
the
question
presented
and
decides
it
contrary
to
the
fifth
circuit.
if
the
court
decides
that
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
should
have...
or
cause
and
prejudice
should
have
been
reached
first,
since
it
was
not
presented
in
the
question
presented,
the
court
should
not
reach
any
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
haley
should
be
able
to
go
about
his
life
and
not
be
subject
to
a
day
more
in
prison
that
the
state
concedes
is
unlawful,
and
as
the
court
advised...
as
the
state
advised
the
district
court,
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
it
intends
to
put
mr.
haley
back
in
prison
for
an
additional
10
years
that
it
specifically
admits
is
unlawful
and
not
authorized
by
the
legislature,
and
a
remand
presumably
would
result
in
the
same
sort
of
injustice
visited
upon
mr.
haley
by
the
state.
for
those
reasons,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
hold
that
mr.
haley
has
sufficiently
established
that
he
is
actually
innocent,
reach
the
merits
of
the
claim,
and...
and
that's
the
only
issue
the
court
needs
to
resolve.
thank
you
very
much.
