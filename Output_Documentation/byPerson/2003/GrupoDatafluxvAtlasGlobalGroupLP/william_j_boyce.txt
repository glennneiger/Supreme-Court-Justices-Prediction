mr.
william
j.
boyce
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
question
here
is
whether
atlas'
post-filing
change
in
citizenship
should
be
allowed
to
create
retroactive
diversity
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
to
justify
rewriting
the
longstanding
time
of
filing
rule,
atlas
relies
on
the
fact
that
this
case
was
tried
to
verdict
before
the
jurisdictional
issue
was
identified
and
raised
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
there
are
two
answers
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg.
in
terms
of
when
we
became
aware
of
the
issue,
that
was
after
verdict,
and
that's
reflected
in
the
affidavit
which
appears
in
the
record
at
volume
i,
page
1887.
in
terms
of
the
question
of
was
there
evidence
in
the
record
that
could
have
been
pieced
together
to
identify
this
issue
earlier,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
if...
if...
it
probably
could
have
been
identified
earlier,
should
have
been
identified
earlier,
but
it
was
not.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
correct.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
two
answers
to
that...
that
question,
your
honor.
first,
under
the
texas
revised
limited
partnership
act,
the...
the
partnership
can
sue...
the
limited
partnership
can
sue
on
its
own
without
the
participation
of
the
limited
partners.
in
terms
of
all
of
the
counterclaims
against
llamosa
and
robles,
again
under
the
texas
statute,
we
can
choose
to
sue
the
partnership
itself
or
we
can
sue
individual
limited
partners.
in
this
circumstance,
our
counterclaim
against
them
was
predicated
not
on
their
status
as
limited
partners,
but
rather
on
the
fact
that
mr.
llamosa
and
mr.
robles
made
affirmative
misrepresentations,
was
our
position,
directly
to
us
to
induce
us
to
enter
the
contract
that
led
to
the...
the
lawsuit.
so--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--there...
there
was
some
confusion
early
on
in
terms
of
what
exactly
their
status
was
and
we,
dataflux,
did
not
thoroughly
explore
that
issue
early
on.
and...
and
that
should
have
been
done
earlier.
but
i
would
also
note
that
the
bottom
line
here
is
that...
is
that
atlas,
the
party
with
unique
knowledge
of
the
exact
circumstances
of
its
partnership
at
the
time
of
filing,
is
the
party
here
who
filed
the
case
in
federal
court
at
a
time
when
there
was
not
diversity
jurisdiction.
there
certainly
could
have
been
more
that
we
should
have
done
to
explore
the
issue
earlier.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
admissions
that
jurisdiction
existed,
but
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
pursuant
to
the
longstanding
rule
that
jurisdiction
cannot
be
stipulated
to,
agreed
to,
created
by
estoppel
or
waiver,
that
those
statements
are
not
effective
to
create
jurisdiction
if
it
does
not
exist
at
the
outset.
and...
and
i
would
emphasize
the
language
that
was
relied
most
recently
in
this
court's
decision
in
kontrick
from
january
in
which
the
court
noted
that
a
court's
subject
matter
jurisdiction
cannot
be
expanded
to
account
for
the
parties'
conduct
during
litigation.
and
i
think
that
principle
addresses
that.
is
there
more
that
could
have
been
done
to
explore
this
earlier...
this
issue
earlier
and
bring
it
up?
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
circumstance
undermines
the
fundamental
rule
here,
which
is
that
as
of
the
time
of
filing,
there
was
not
a
diversity
present,
and
because
of
that--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i
think
the...
there
is
some
room
to
discuss
that,
justice
ginsburg,
in
light
of
the
dissent's
contention
that
there
was,
in
fact,
no
diversity
where
you
have
one
litigant
here,
one
plaintiff,
one
defendant,
and
both
are
citizens
of
mexico
at
that
time.
it
may
be
a
situation
where--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
there...
there--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--atlas
is
one
entity
with
multiple
citizenships,
and...
and
if...
if
the
question
suggests
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a...
a
dismissal
mechanism
available
to
make
the...
the
mexican
citizenship
go
away,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
available
under
the
facts
of
this
case
because
it's...
it...
there
were--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--pursuant
to
atlas'
decision
to
change
the
constitution
of
its
partnership
after
the
time
of
filing
and
before
the
case
was
submitted
to
the...
to
the
jury.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
before
the...
approximate--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--that
is
correct.
approximately
6
weeks
prior
to
trial,
the
change
in
atlas'
composition
became
effective
so
that
at
that
point
there
would...
there
is
complete
diversity
if
that
post-filing
change
is
given
effect.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
under
the
longstanding
rule,
going
back
as
far
as
1824
in
mollan
v.
torrance,
reflected
in
the
1891
decision
in
anderson
v.
watt,
that
the
longstanding
rule
has
been,
and
should
continue
to
be
in
this
case,
that
post
changes--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i
think
that
the
statement
in
mollan,
as
reflected
in
conolly
and
then
applied
in
anderson
v.
watt,
your
honor,
is
that
if
the
change
in
circumstances
is
the
result
of
the
addition
or
subtraction
of
a
party,
that's
one
circumstance,
but
here
we
have
something
entirely
different,
which
is
a
change
in
citizenship.
it
would
be
the
same
as
if
a
plaintiff
had
lived
in
one
state
and
then
moved
to
another
state.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
correct,
under
carden.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
because
i
think
atlas'
citizenship
changed
by
virtue
of
changing
the
composition
of
its
partnership,
and
that
is
on
all
fours
the
same
circumstance
as
if
a...
a
litigant
had
lived
in
one
state
and
then
tried
to
move
to
another
state
in
an
effort
to
create
retroactive
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
the...
the
function
of
atlas
changing
its
citizenship
after
the
time
of
filing
and
thereafter
claiming...
this
is
atlas'
argument...
that
that
cures
our
jurisdictional
defect,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
is
the
same
thing
as
a
citizen
moving
from
one
state
to
the
other
because,
in
effect,
what
atlas
is
saying,
by
relying
on
that
argument,
is
we
moved
out
of...
move
out
of
mexico
and...
and
resided
exclusively
in
texas
as
of
the
time
of
suit.
that
is
the
whole
basis
for
atlas'
argument
as
to
why
the
jurisdictional
defect,
according
to
atlas,
was
cured
as
of
the
time
of
trial.
and
i
think
that's
where
the...
the
conflict
comes
in
with
the
change
of--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i'm...
i
didn't--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--then
it
would
be
under
the...
the
different
provision
of
1332.
it
would
be
a
citizen
of
its
place
of
incorporation
and
its
principal
place
of
business,
and
that
would
not
be
the
issue
that...
that
we
have
here
today.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
there...
there...
yes,
there
would
not
be
an
issue
here
because
of
a
different
operation
of
1332
as
applied
to
corporations,
but
the
point
of
carden
was,
as...
as
i
read
the
case,
is
that
limited
partnerships
are
going
to
be
treated
differently.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
there
is
no
analog
from
corporate--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i
understand
the...
the
point,
and
our
position
is
that
when
atlas
contends
that
it
has
cured
the
jurisdictional
defect
by
changing
the
composition
of
its
partnership,
that
is
effectively
the
same
as
the
litigant
moving
from
new
jersey
to
new
york
and
claiming
i
have...
i
have
fixed
the
jurisdictional
problem
because
my
citizenship
has
changed.
it
comes
down
to
a
change
in
citizenship,
and
i
think
that's
what
implicates
the
longstanding
rule
that
the
court
has
enforced
repeatedly.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
the
proper
subject
of
a
collateral
attack
after
the
initial
case
in
which
it
has
been
adjudicated
is
over
with.
but
in
terms
of
where
along
the
line
within
that
case
can
it
be
raised,
our
position
is
it
can
be
raised,
indeed,
must
be
raised--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--that
is
my
understanding.
and...
and
i
think
the
most
closely
analogous
case
to
the
hypothetical
that...
that
you're
putting
forth
would
be
the
capron
v.
noorden
case
from
1804.
it
was
discussed
in...
in
this
court's
recent
decision
in
kontrick
where
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
who
had
filed
the
case
in
federal
court
lost
at
trial
and
then
went
up
on
appeal
to
this
court.
the
plaintiff
who
filed
the
case
at
that
late
stage
identified
the
lack
of
jurisdiction,
and
then
the
court
said
there
is
no
jurisdiction
here.
if
there's
no
jurisdiction,
there's
no
jurisdiction
and
the...
the
timing
of
the
conduct
of
it
is
not
germane
to
that
inquiry
because
it's
not
something
that
can
be
created
by
the
parties'
litigation
conduct--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--that...
that's
our
point.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
i...
i
would
like
to
address
the
circumstances
under
which
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
caterpillar
because
that
obviously
is...
is
what
atlas
relies
very
heavily
on
in
its
briefing.
and
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
important
distinctions
here,
the
first
and
foremost
being
that
the
citizenship
of
the
parties
to
the
final
judgment
in
caterpillar
did
not
change.
that
was
a
circumstance
where
the...
the
diversity-spoiling
litigant
was
dismissed
pursuant
to
rule
21.
that
is
not
our
circumstance
here.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
that
would
be
a
different
circumstance.
i...
i
hasten
to
add
that
in
terms
of
atlas
suing
dataflux,
mr.
llamosa
and
mr.
robles
were
not
plaintiffs.
atlas
itself
was
the
plaintiff,
and
the
problem
arises
because
of
the...
the
mexican
citizenship
of
mr.
llamosa
and
robles
is
attributed
to
atlas.
but
if...
if
a
different
circumstance
is...
is
hypothesized
where
there's
a
dismissal,
then
i
think
that
brings
rule
21
into
play.
as...
as
the
court
discussed
in...
in
the
newman-green
decision,
there
is
a
source
of
authority
for
addressing
that
circumstance
under
rule
21.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
this
is
not
a
removal
case,
this
is
not
a
dismissal
case,
and
the
question
arises--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--your
honor,
i...
i
would
not
presume
to...
to
say
what
the...
the
court
meant
to
do,
but
i
would
highlight
the
discussion
in
the
subsequent
lexicon
case
where
the
point,
i
think,
was
made
that
indeed
caterpillar
was
grounded
on
the
removal
statute
and
specifically
section
1441,
the
issue
being
in
caterpillar
that
the
case
was
not
fit
for
federal
adjudication
at
the
time
of
removal
and
that
that
was
the
error.
there
was
an
untimely
compliance
with--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
there
are
different...
there's
a
different
statutory
overlay
that...
that
was
being
addressed
in
caterpillar,
the
overlay
of
the
removal
statutes.
here
we're
under
a
circumstance
where
this...
this
is
not
a
removal
case.
therefore,
we
are
under
section
1332
alone,
and
the...
the
longstanding
rule
that
the
citizenship
is
going
to
be
measured
as
of
the
time
of
filing.
at...
at
this
stage
where
the
rule
has
been
followed
for
some
180
years,
i
believe
that
similar
to
a
complete
diversity
requirement,
it
is
now
part
and
parcel
of
section
1332.
so
there...
there's
no
removal
overlay
to
be
addressed.
and...
and
there's
an
additional
circumstance
here
that
i
think
in
significant
part,
caterpillar
operates
to
protect
a
defendant's
right
to
removal.
the...
the
removal
in
that
case...
the
removal
right
was
subject
to
being
lost
because
of
the
timing
of
the
dismissal
of
the
non-diverse
party.
there
was
a...
a
problem
for
caterpillar
in
bumping
up
against
the
1-year
time
limit.
in
other
words,
caterpillar
operates
to
protect
a...
a
right
to
invoke
the
federal
forum.
here,
by
definition--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i...
i
would
go
back
to
lexicon's
description
of
caterpillar
which
is
that
there
was
an--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
at...
at
bottom
caterpillar
cannot
be
divorced
from
the
removal
context
in
which
it
arose.
and
it...
it
was...
it
was--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i
think
that
under
certain
circumstances
congress
has
made
a
distinction
between
a
defendant's
right
to
invoke
a
federal
forum
and
a
plaintiff's
right
to
invoke
a
federal
forum.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
it
is
a...
primarily
a
statutory
rule
operating--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i...
i
need
to
qualify
my
answer,
justice
stevens,
because
under
some
circumstances
there
may
be
article
iii
implications
here
because
if...
if
it's
a
circumstance
where
you
have
just
an
issue
of
whether
or
not
there's
complete
diversity,
then
that's
a
statutory
issue.
but
if...
if
retroactive
diversity
is
being
recognized
so
as
to
allow
a
case
to
remain
in
federal
court
for
some
2
or
3
years,
as
happened
in
this
situation,
where
there
isn't
even
article
iii
diversity
requirement...
let's
say
you
have
an
alien
versus
an
alien
with
no
citizen
present.
that
does
have
article
iii
implications.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
i
think
that...
and
i...
i
cannot
cite
the
case
that...
that
i'm
relying
on
for
that,
but
in
the...
in
the
course
of
reviewing,
i...
i
believe
that
i
saw
the...
the
statement
regarding
collateral
attack.
but
i--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--but
i...
i
think
maybe
the...
the
primary
focus
here
in
terms
of
the
applicability
of
the
time
of
filing
rule
is
one
that...
that
turns
on
the...
the
purposes
of
the
time
of
filing
rule.
these
are
summarized
in...
in
the--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--correct.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
i...
i
have
to
agree
that...
that
both
conolly
v.
taylor
and
mollan
v.
torrance
do
not
specifically
anchor
it
in
the
statute,
and
to...
to
some
extent,
i
would...
i
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
they're
somewhat
cryptic.
but
i
think
the...
the
clearest
statutory
anchor
as
the
basis
of
this
rule
comes
from
anderson
v.
watt
which,
applying
mollan
and
applying
conolly,
does
specifically
anchor
it
in
the
1875
iteration
of
the
diversity
statute
in
the
course
of
its
discussion.
and...
and
i
think
that's
the
clearest
indication
that
this
is
indeed--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--1891.
correct.
and
the
point
that
we
would
emphasize
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
longstanding
interpretation,
similar
to
complete
diversity
as
discussed
in
the
owen
equipment
v.
kroger
case,
is
now
a
part
and
parcel
of
section
1332
and
its
predecessors.
and...
and
so
it's
not
a
situation
merely
that
the
fifth
circuit
is...
is
stepping
into
some
area
where
the
court
did
not
expressly
address
it
in
caterpillar.
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
has,
in
fact,
gone
beyond
that
by
creating
this
new
rule
because
it's
a
circumstance
where
it
is
going
contrary
to
the
longstanding
interpretation
and
understanding
of
1332.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
i...
i
would
focus
on
one
portion
of
your
honor's
question,
which
is
in
terms
of
an
assumption
that
this
case
automatically
would
go
back
to
federal
court.
that
may
well
happen,
but
we
don't
know--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i
think
an
underlying
assumption
of
that
question
is
that
atlas
has
not
yet
again
changed
its...
its
partnership,
and
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
there
will
be
an
issue...
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that...
that
whether
or
not
limitations
would
prevent...
present
an
obstacle
to
atlas
is
going
to
be
determined
under
the
texas
savings
statute
and/or
the
new
york
savings
statute.
there
was
a
choice
of
law
dispute
in
the
case.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
and
there
is
a...
a
savings
statute,
assuming
texas
law
applies,
that
would
allow
atlas
to
refile
suit.
one
point
that
i
would
note...
and...
and
this
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
record,
but
i...
i
would
put
it
before
the
court
to
completely
answer
the
question...
is
that
atlas
already
has
refiled
once
within
10
days
of
the
initial
dismissal.
it
refiled
in
federal
court
and
then
subsequently
dismissed
the
second
federal
court
lawsuit.
there
may
be
an
issue
under
the
savings
statute
in
terms
of
how
many
times
do
you
get
to
refile,
and...
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
we
haven't
looked
at
that
specifically.
but
there
is
a
savings
statute
available,
and...
and
i
presume
atlas
would
invoke
it.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
they
filed
after
the
trial
court
dismissal
and
before
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
their
favor,
and
i
believe
that
the...
the
second
suit
was
filed
in
december
of
2000
and
dismissed
in
approximately
october
of
2001.
i
think
that's
the
chronology
of
it.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
i
think
it
was
before
the...
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
in
the
case.
but
the...
the
point
that
i
would
emphasize
is
that
the...
the
purposes
of
the
time
of
filing
rule
transcend
any
individual
case--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--justice
breyer,
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
is
uncertainty
in
what
was
formerly
a
bright
line
rule
in
terms
of
litigants
being
able
to
determine
with
some
certainty
whether
or
not
they
belong
in
federal
court.
and
i
would
also
focus
on
this
point,
which
is
i...
i
think
the
one
question
that
the
fifth
circuit
and
atlas
do
not
answer
is
what
is
the
source
of
authority
for
a
federal
court
to
recognize
this
retroactive
jurisdiction
here?
by
process
of
elimination,
we
know
what
it
is
not.
it
is
not
section
1653,
because
that
addresses
only
defective
allegations,
not
defective
facts.
it
is
not
section
1441
or
1446
because
this
is
not
a
removal
case,
and
it's
not
rule
21.
so
the...
the
bottom
line
inquiry
then
is
what
is
the
source
of
this
authority
and...
and
i
don't
think
the
authority
is
there,
and
in
fact
this
is
contrary
to
section
1332.
and
with
that,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
an
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
which
has
been
touched
on
by
a
number
of
the
questions
here,
which
is
what's
the
worst
that
can
happen.
and
i...
i
think
the
point
would
be
this.
once
the
efficacy
of
a
post-filing
change
in
citizenship
is...
is
taken
as
a
given,
then
i
think
you're...
you're
setting
up
a
situation
where
the
door
swings
both
ways.
jurisdiction
can
be
created
and
jurisdiction
can
be
destroyed
by
virtue
of
post-filing
changes.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
the...
the
rule...
if...
if
the
line
is
drawn
there,
then
i...
i
think
that
raises
implications
of
manipulation.
you
can
move
and
create
it
and
then
move
back
and
not
destroy
it.
if...
if
the
concern
is
creating
incentives--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--if...
there...
there
may
be...
the...
the
court
will
do
what
it
will
do.
the...
the
question
is,
is
there
an...
a
creation
of
additional
opportunities
for
manipulation
or
confusion,
and
we--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--and...
and
i
submit
that
if
the
bright
line
rule
is
no
longer
bright,
if
it...
if
it
turns
on
the
fact
of
how
far
into
the
trial
court
proceedings
before
this
came
up,
then
it's...
the...
the
time
when
you
need
certainty
most,
in
terms
of
being
able
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
have
jurisdiction,
that's
when
there's
going
to
be
the
least
amount
of
clarity.
and
that's
the
real...
the
real
problem
that's...
that's
created
here.
and...
and
justice
stevens
had...
had
asked
the...
the
question
saying,
well,
why
don't
we
just
draw
the...
the
line?
you
want
a
bright
line
rule?
we'll...
we'll
draw
it
at
the
time
of
trial.
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
what
you're
setting
up
is
a
circumstance
where
for
some
period
of
time,
a
trial
court,
a
federal
district
court
is
acting
ultra
vires,
to
borrow
the
phrase
from
steel
company,
for
some
period
of
time
prior
to
whenever
you
say
the...
the
post-filing
change
could
become
effective.
you've
got
a
federal
trial
court
that
is
operating
without
authority.
it's
issuing
orders.
mr.
william
j.
boyce
but
prior
to
the
time
of
that
curing
of
that
defect,
you
have
a
circumstance
as
you
had
here
for
3
years,
for
example,
where
you've
got
a
federal
district
court
issuing
summary--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--and...
and
i
guess
the
point
i
would
make
is...
is
this.
if
caterpillar
opened
the
door
to
a
component
of
retroactive
jurisdiction,
it
did
not
open
that
door
very
wide.
and...
and
the...
the
choice
is
should
that...
should
that
door
be
opened
wider
and
what
are
the
problems
that
result
from
that.
and
our
position
would
be
that
the
confusion
and
uncertainty
and
opportunities
for
manipulation
that
are
going
to
result
from
opening
that
door
wider
make
it
appropriate
to
leave
the
line
drawn
where--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--that
may
not
be
a...
a
circumstance
that...
that
is
likely
to
happen,
but--
mr.
william
j.
boyce
--i...
i
think
the...
the
greater
issue
is...
is
one
of
uncertainty
and
of
having
a
circumstance
like
this
case
or
going
back
as
early
as...
as
the
capron
case
where
the
case
gets
filed
and
gets
tried
and
then
the
issue
comes
up.
i
do
want
to
make
one
note
about
the
reference
to
the
knop
case.
