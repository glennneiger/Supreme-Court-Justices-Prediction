justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
boyce,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
how
far
your
position
extends?
you
say
that
it
wasn't
too
late
to...
to
raise
the
jurisdictional
issue
when
you
did.
supposing
there
had
been
a
trial
and
instead
of
your
losing,
you
had
won,
and
then
you
knew
about
the
jurisdictional
defect,
and
then
you
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
on
appeal.
then
you
lost
on
appeal.
and
then
you
decided
to
raise
the
jurisdictional
defect.
would
you
say
that
was...
they
would
then
be
required
to
dismiss?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
suppose
then
it
was
affirmed
and
then
you
decided
you
didn't
realize
it
until
after
the
judgment
had
been
entered
and
become
final
and
so
forth,
and
then
a
year
later
you
find
out
about
it.
could
you
raise
it
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
say
it
can
always
be
raised
on
direct...
while...
until
final
judgment
is
entered,
but
it
can
never
be
raised
on
collateral
attack.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
rely
on
a
distinction
between
a
defendant's
right
to
a
federal
forum
and
the
plaintiff's
to
a
federal
forum?
it
seems
to
me
they're
exactly
the
same.
at
the
time
it's
invoked,
it's...
there's
no
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
are
you...
are
you
saying
this
is...
is
the
rule
you
rely
on
a
constitutional
rule
or
a
statutory
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
don't
say
the
constitution
would
prohibit
us
from
affirming.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there's
a...
there's
no
subject
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
just
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
but
nevertheless,
you
say
there
could
be
no...
no
collateral
attack
on
the
judgment.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the...
why
there
couldn't
be
a
collateral
attack
if
you're
dead
right
on
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you're
right,
but
i'm
just
wondering
why.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
one
general
question?
in...
in
your
view
is
the
rule
that
you
advocate
a
one-way
street
in
the
sense
that
if
there
was
jurisdiction
when
the
case
was
filed,
then
the
next
week
the
plaintiff
moved
to
the
same
state
of
the
defendant,
there
would
nevertheless
continue
to
be
jurisdiction
all
the
way
down
the
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's...
this...
this
rule,
if
we
adopt
it,
is
100...
it's...
it's
to...
it's
always
to
preserve
or
to
allow
a...
a
belated
creation
of
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
then
the
second
question
is...
i
just
want
to
be
100
percent
sure
on
your
view...
is
if
the
original
defect
is
discovered
before
trial,
even
though
it
had
been
corrected
a
day
or
2
later,
there
would
still
be
a
duty
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction
because
there
was
no
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
filing,
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
if
we're
looking
for
bright
line
rules,
we
shouldn't
make
it
turn
on
what
the
nature
of
a
particular
jurisdictional
defect
was
or
they
moved
to
another
state
or
you
let
one
partner
resign
of
something
like
that.
the
bright
line
rule,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
turn
on
whether
it's
equally
bright
line
to
say
you
can
make
this
objection
up
till
the
time
of
a
verdict
in
the
trial
court
or
it's
equally
bright
line
to
say
you
can
do
it
up
to
the
time
that
the
appellate
court
judgment
is
final.
you
can't
do
it
after...
we
all
agree
you
can't
do
it
on
collateral
attack.
and
i
don't
know
why
one
is
any
more
bright
line
than
the
other,
unless
you
get
into
these
ramifications
that
there's
a
difference
between
removal
and
filing
or
a
difference
between
the...
the
plaintiff
moving
to
another
state
or...
or
adding
a
partner.
those
are
all...
it
seems
to
me
any
one
of
those
would
depart
from
the
need
for
a
bright
line
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
you
assume
the
jurisdictional
defect
has
been
cured.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
you
had
in
caterpillar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
imagine
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
deliberately
filing
a
federal
lawsuit
where
he
knows
there's
no
federal
jurisdiction?
why
would
he
ever
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
talking
about
deliberate
manipulation,
and
i
just
don't
understand
why
a
competent
lawyer
would
ever
do
that.
