justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
understanding
that
the...
that
the
attorney
for
atlas
in
this
case
would
have
the
obligation
to
advise
the
court
of
the
problem
the
moment
it
was
discovered?
does
the
attorney
have
an
ethical
duty
to
advise
that
the
original
pleading
was...
was
misleading
as...
as
soon
as
the
attorney
finds
out
that
this
problem
existed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does...
does
the
record
tell
us
why
the
partnership
was
changed
in
its
composition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
same
attorneys
represent
the
partnership
in...
in
this
change
of
partner
transaction
as
were
representing
the...
atlas
in
the
litigation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
the
fifth
circuit
rule,
suppose
there's
no
diversity
when
the
suit
is
filed
because
the
plaintiff
resides
in
the
same
state
as
one
of
the
defendants,
and
then
the
plaintiff
moves
in
order
to
create
diversity.
doesn't
the
fifth
circuit
rule
permit
that
to
occur
without
destroying
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
let's
say
this
is
done
just
before
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
which?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
caterpillar.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they're
pretty
big
distinctions
because
in
the
other
cases,
they
were
just
extra
parties
that
could
be
dropped
out.
here
the
whole
partnership...
the
nature
of
the
partnership
had
to
change.
there
was...
the...
the
initial
premise
for
the
jurisdiction
was
wrong
based
on
the
identity
and
the
composition
of
the
partnership,
not
the
identity
and
the
composition
of
all
of
the
parties
that
are
in
the
complaint.
now,
that
may
be
metaphysical,
but
it...
it
does
seem
to
me
to
open
more
room
for
manipulation
than
existed
just
with
caterpillar
on
the
books.
