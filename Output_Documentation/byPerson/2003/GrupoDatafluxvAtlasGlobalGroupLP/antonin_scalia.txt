justice

we
have
to
punish
some
other
way,
maybe
fine
you
or
make
you
pay
costs
for
the
other
side,
but
we
cannot
punish
you
for
that
by
expanding
our
own
jurisdiction.
that's
your
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
caterpillar
involved
a...
a
situation
in
which
the
jurisdictional
defect
was
cured
by
a
change
in
which
parties
were
in
the
case.
that
has
not
occurred
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
party
is
the
same,
and
that
makes
it
a
different
case.
you
can't
possibly
say
we've
decided
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's...
it's
really...
it's
really
quite
different
to
say,
look
it,
it's
the
same
party
here
who
was
here
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
this
very
same
person,
and
he's
been
here
all
through.
all
that's
happened
is
one
other
person
who...
who
destroyed
jurisdiction
has
gotten
out.
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
something
different
to
say
we
had...
we
had
one
person,
you
know,
originally
with...
with
a
certain
citizenship.
that's...
that
same
person
is
here.
it
was
bad
as
to...
as
to
him
originally,
but
now
it's
changed
because
he's
changed
his
citizenship.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
same
situation.
it
seems
to
me
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
be
the
end
of
filing,
not...
not
before
trial.
he
said...
the...
the
question
is
before...
you're...
you're
taking
the
position
before
trial.
once
trial
has
started--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
not
what
caterpillar
says.
having
been
tried
is
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i...
i
take
that
to
mean
the
trial
having
been
completed.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
get
back
to...
to
bright
line
rules?
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
bright
line
rule,
that
you
can
preserve
jurisdiction
by
dismissing
a
party.
that's
very
bright
line.
i
don't
think
it's
very
bright
line
to
say,
you
know,
whenever
there
was
a
jurisdictional
defect
which
later
is
cured...
in
any
way
whatever?
i
mean,
this
case
involves
an
alteration
in
the
citizenship
of
the
partnership.
what
about
an
alteration
of
the
citizenship
of
the
corporation?
they
reincorporate
somewhere
else
before
the
thing
happens?
what
about
a...
a
private
individual
who
decides
to
move
to
another
state?
is
that
covered?
is
this
bright
line
when...
when
we
still
have
all
of
these...
all
of
these
future
cases
in
front
of
us?
it
seems
to
me
it
is
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
the
partnership
sued
as
an
entity?
i
thought
that
it
was
sued
as
a
partnership.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
partnership.
and
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
there
was
no
jurisdiction
initially
over
the
partnership.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
at...
at
the
outset,
contrary
to
the
earlier
statement,
it
was
not
a
matter
of
imperfect
jurisdiction.
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
atlas.

the...
of
the

justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
respondent
atlas
global
group,
lp
is
a
limited
partnership
created
under
texas
law.
it
filed
a
state
law
suit
against
petitioner,
a
mexican
corporation,
in
federal
court
alleging
diversity
jurisdiction.
after
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
in
favor
of
atlas,
but
before
the
entry
of
judgment,
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
the
parties
were
not
diverse
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
in
granting
the
motion,
the
magistrate
judge
found
that
as
a
partnership,
atlas
was
a
mexican
citizen
because
two
of
its
partners,
also
respondents
in
the
case,
were
mexican
citizens
at
the
time
of
filing.
a
partnership,
we
have
held,
there
is
the
citizenship
of
each
of
its
partners.
thus,
the
requisite
diversity
was
absent
because
petitioner
grupo
dataflux
was
also
a
mexican
citizen.
on
appeal,
atlas
urged
the
fifth
circuit
to
disregard
the
diversity
failure
at
the
time
of
filing
because
the
mexican
partners
had
withdrawn
from
atlas
before
the
trial
began,
and
thus
diversity
existed
from
that
time
on.
relying
on
a
case
called
caterpillar,
inc.
versus
lewis,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
conclusiveness
of
citizenship
at
the
time
of
filing
is
subject
to
an
exception
whereas
here,
the
jurisdictional
error
was
not
identified
until
after
the
jury’s
verdict
and
the
post-filing
change
in
the
partnership
cured
the
jurisdiction
with
effect
before
the
defect
was
identified.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
this
court
has
long
adhered
to
the
rule
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
diversity
cases
depends
on
the
state
of
facts
that
existed
at
the
time
of
filing.
atlas
relies
principally
on
our
decision
in
a
recent
case
called
caterpillar
which
stated
that
“once
a
diversity
case
has
been
tried
in
federal
court,
considerations
of
finality,
efficiency,
and
economy
become
overwhelming."
however,
this
statement
from
caterpillar
did
not
augur
a
new
approach
to
deciding
whether
a
jurisdictional
defect
has
been
cured.
the
jurisdictional
defect
that
caterpillar
addressed
had
been
cured
by
the
dismissal
of
the
party
that
had
destroyed
diversity,
a
curing
method
that
had
long
been
an
exemption
to
the
time
of
filing
rule.
but
saving
diversity
by
dropping
a
party,
an
unnecessary
party,
is
different
from
trying
to
save
diversity
by
changing
a
party's
citizenship.
this
court
has
never
approved
of
deviation
from
the
rule
articulated
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
1829
in
a
case
called
conolly
versus
taylor
that
“where
there
is
no
change
of
party
a
jurisdiction,
depending
on
the
condition
of
the
party,
is
governed
by
that
condition
as
it
was
at
the
commencement
of
the
suit.”
this
principle
from
conolly
disposes
of
the
present
case,
there
has
been
no
change
of
party.
the
composition
of
the
partnership
and
consequently
its
citizenship
change
but
allowing
this
change
in
the
citizenship
of
a
single
party
to
cure
the
jurisdictional
defect
existing
at
the
time
of
filing
would
contravene
the
conolly
principle.
we
decline
to
do
today
what
the
court
has
refused
to
do
for
175
years,
holding
that
“finality,
efficiency,
and
judicial
economy”
can
justify
suspension
of
the
time
of
filing
rule
would
create
an
exception
of
indeterminate
scope
that
is
bound
to
produce
costly
collateral
litigation.
although,
unflinching
application
of
the
rule
in
this
case
requires
dismissal
of
a
fully
litigated
case,
the
costs
to
the
system
as
a
whole
of
maintaining
an
open-ended
exception
to
the
rule
outweigh
the
interest
of
the
individual
parties
before
the
court
in
today’s
case,
who
after
all
have
none
but
themselves
to
blame
for
not
noticing
the
absence
of
diversity
sooner.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
a
party’s
post-filling
change
in
citizenship
cannot
cure
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
that
existed
at
the
time
of
filing
in
a
diversity
action.
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissent
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
breyer
have
joined.
