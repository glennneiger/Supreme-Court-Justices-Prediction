justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
with
respect
to
that?
when
you
found
out
that
you
had
this
fundamental
jurisdictional
objection,
when
did
you
know
that
the
partnership
included
partners
not
only
texas
entities
but
two
mexican
citizens?
when
did
you
find
that
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
curious
thing
about
what
dataflux
did.
dataflux
at
one
point
moved
to
add
the
mexicans
as
individuals
as
counterdefendants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
would
it
do
that
if
they
were
members
of
the
partnership.
if...
if
it
was
sure
that
they
were
members
of
the
partnership,
then
you
wouldn't
need
to
make
them
defendants
as
individuals
because
partners
have
individual
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
at
that
stage,
you
called
them
employees
or
former
employees.
so
it
seems
that
the...
that
you
had
some
inkling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you've
admitted
it.
you...
you
just
admitted
it
flat
out
in
your
answer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
was
in
the
constitutional
sense.
there
wasn't
under
the
statute.
there
was
diversity,
but
not
complete
diversity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what...
well,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
that
atlas
is
a
partnership.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
it...
and
that
there
are
three
players
involved...
five.
two
are
mexican
and
three
are
texan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
you
would
have
on
one
side
texan
and
mexican
and
the
other
side
texan.
if
you
drop
out
the
mexicans,
then
you're
left,
from
the
plaintiff's
side...
you're
left
with
a
complete
diversity
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
what
happened.
they
did
go
away
for
a
reason
unrelated
to
this
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
long
before
the
case
was
tried.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
so
when
the
case...
when
this
case
was
tried,
there
was
complete
diversity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
in
mollan
v.
torrance
exactly
what
i
described
happened.
chief
justice
marshall
said
you've
got
one
spoiler
on
the
plaintiffs'
side.
take
it
out
and
you'll
have
complete
diversity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
it's
not
the
same.
it
isn't
the
same
because
a
partnership
is
a
citizen
of
every
state
in
which
a
partner
resides.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
have,
just
as
if
you'd
have
five
individuals...
that's
what
they
are
in
fact...
in
effect,
because
they're
jointly
and
severally
liable.
so
you
have,
as
i
said
before,
three
texan
and
two
mexicans.
you
don't
have
one
person
that
can
say,
ah,
i'm
going
to
defeat
diversity
by
moving
where
i
live,
or
i'm
going
to
create
diversity.
you...
none
of
these
people's
citizenships
has
ever
changed.
that's
quite
different
from
somebody
saying,
i
want
to
change
my
citizenship.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
didn't
leave
texas
behind.
texas
was
always
there.
the
mexican
partners
left.
so
i
just
don't
see
that
it's
anything
like...
i
mean,
this...
as
i
said
before,
there's
the
same
five
people.
two
drop
out
and
so
you've
got
three
texans,
and
there
were
always
three
texans.
they
didn't
move
to
texas.
they
were
there
from
the
start.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
atlas
had
been
a
corporation
incorporated
in
texas,
then
there
would
have
been
complete
diversity.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
atlas...
instead
of
being
a
partnership
composed
of
five
members,
it
had
organized
as
a
corporation,
as
a
texas
corporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would...
would...
my
question
is
wouldn't
the...
if
these...
if
this
entity
had
been
organized
as
a
corporation,
there
would
have
been
complete
diversity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't
want
to
belabor
this
any
further,
but
you
do
see
the
difference
between
an
individual
moving
from
new
york
to
new
jersey,
say,
and
a...
a
partnership
with
five
partners,
all
of
whom
remain
where
they
are.
they
don't
move
anyplace
else.
those
partners,
those
live
human
beings,
stay
exactly
what
they
were.
their
citizenship
doesn't
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
capron
against
noorden
was
one
party
on
one
side,
one
party
on
the
other.
it
wasn't
a
case
where
at
the
time
of
the
trial
there
was
complete
diversity.
i
frankly
have
a
hard
time
distinguishing
this
case
from
caterpillar
which
started
out
non-diverse
but
before
trial,
became
diverse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
the...
this
would
be
the
same
if
the...
atlas
had
come
to
the
court
and
said,
now,
court,
i
want
you
to
dismiss
the
two
mexicans
because
they're
no
longer
part
of
the
corporation,
and
gotten
an
order
to...
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
was
could
they
have
dismissed
and...
and
as
far
as
removal,
i
perhaps
don't
remember
caterpillar
that
well,
but
of
course,
it
arose
out
of
a
removal.
that's
how
it
happened.
but
the
court
didn't
make
the
removal
dispositive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
it
certainly
was
a
1441,
and
the
opinion
certainly
alerts
district
judges
that
when
a
case
comes
over
from
the
state
court,
maybe
you
ought
to
look
at
it
to
make
sure
that
there
is
federal
jurisdiction.
but
i
didn't
think
that
there
was
anything
peculiar
about
1441
and
the
obligation
of
a
judge
to
look
into
jurisdiction.
i
don't
know
why
the
same
thing
wouldn't
apply
to
1332.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
follow
that
because
it
was
wrongfully
removed
by
the
defendant,
had
no
right
to
be
in
the
federal
forum
when
he
got
there,
and...
and
the
poor
plaintiff
who
wanted
to
be
in
the
state
court
got
stuck
with
losing
a
federal
court
case.
so
it
wasn't
protecting
the
defendant
right
to
remove.
the
defendant
had
no
right
to
remove.
it
wasn't
a
proper
federal
case
until...
who
was
it...
one
of
the
parties
got
dropped
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
don't
you
go
back
to
caterpillar's
description
of
caterpillar?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
correct
in
that
respect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
take
you
back
a
little
way?
it
is
unconstitutional
because
incomplete
diversity
is
fine.
minimal
diversity
is
fine
under
the
constitution.
the
statute,
1332,
has
always
been
interpreted
to
require
complete
diversity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
marshall
first
mentions
that
you
can't
oust
jurisdiction
by
something
that
happens
after,
he
doesn't
talk
about
the
statute.
the
cases
that
you
are...
are
discussing,
out
of
which
the
timely
filing
rule
arises...
it's
a
kind
of
a
common
law
that
he's
spreading
out.
he
doesn't
cite
the...
the
jurisdictional
statute
for
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
the
bottom
line
of
what
the
situation
would
be,
there
was
a
trial
between
totally
diverse
parties.
you...
you
say
that
has
to
be
undone.
there's
no
question
now
that
there's
complete
diversity
between
these
same
two
parties.
so
this
isn't
a
case
where
there's
any
federalism
interest.
this
wouldn't
go
back
to
the
state
court.
this
is
a
proper
suit
for
atlas
to
bring
in
federal
court,
and
so
you'd
have
the
same
court,
the
same
parties
going
over
exactly
the
same
case,
which
does
seem
a
terrible
waste.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no.
it
would
be
up
to
atlas,
but
atlas
at
this
point,
being
totally
diverse
from
dataflux,
could
walk
in...
the
day
that
atlas
is
thrown
out,
it
can
come
in
the
revolving
door
and
say,
here's
a
fresh
complaint.
let's
start
all
over
again.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may...
may
i
ask
you
is
there
another
impediment
that
you
do
know
about
like
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
assumed...
i
assumed
you
looked
into
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
what
point
did
they
file
and
refile?
because
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
their
favor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
dismissed
after
they
won
on
appeal
or
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
something
that
you
overlooked
or
whoever
was
representing
atlas.
when
did
atlas
first
become
aware
that
the
citizenship
of
each
partner
counts
for
diversity?
i
mean,
this
was
set
up
as
a
texas
business,
but
in
a
partnership,
unlike
a
corporation,
each
partner's
citizenship
counts
equally.
and
when
did
you
first
become
aware
of
that
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
see
any
impediment?
or,
first
of
all,
explain
to
me
what
that
second
filing
was.
mr.
boyce
told
us--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
you
filed
a
second
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
did
that
before
you
knew
what
the
outcome
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
know
of
any
impediment?
now...
now
it's
for
sure
that
you
can
go
back
to
the
same
court
with
the
same
parties,
do
the
same
thing
all
over
again.
mr.
boyce
said
that
as
far
as
the
texas
statute
of
limitations
is
concerned,
it's
not
a
problem.
is...
is
there
anything
that...
apart
from
repeating
the
same
thing,
that
would
put
you
at
a
disadvantage?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
that
that
situation
is
just
what
justice
marshall
dealt
with
when
he
said
you
cannot
oust
a
court
of
jurisdiction
once
lodged.
so
if
there
is
authority,
then
it
doesn't
matter
whether
that
plaintiff
moves.
i
mean,
the
plaintiff
who
certainly
couldn't
move
and
become
non-diverse
and
hope
to
escape
an
adverse
judgment...
i
thought...
i
thought
that
rule
was
firm,
that
a
single
plaintiff,
if
it's
just
a
two-party
lawsuit,
jurisdiction
is
not
ousted.
and
i
don't
think
that
caterpillar
in
any
way
suggests
that
that
one
party
plaintiff
situation
would
be
different.
the...
the
partnership
is
sort
of
in
between.
it's
not
like
a
single
individual,
but
it's
not
quite
like
caterpillar
either
where
there
were
wholly
discrete
parties.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
caterpillar
said,
that
if
at
the
time
of
trial--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
have
no
spoiler
in
the
picture,
which
was
what
caterpillar
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
there's
a
sentence
that
says
something
different,
but
the
facts
in
caterpillar
was
before
the
trial
began,
it
was
complete
diversity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose...
suppose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
you
had
gone
to
that
trial
with
the
two
mexicans
still
in
the
partnership
and
you
had
won,
and
then
could
you
then
have
said
to
the
court,
we
don't
need
those
mexican
partners?
they're
out
of
here.
so
now,
we'd
like
to
make
a
motion
under
rule
21
to
drop
those
two
people
from
the
party
lineup.
could
you
have
done
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
suggesting
that
a
plaintiff
could
play
the
same
game
as
a
defendant
could
play,
say,
oh,
i'm
going
to
go
in...
i'm
going
to
go
in
and
get
my
trial,
and
i'm
going
to
have
those
two
spoilers
in
the
case,
and
if
i
win,
fine,
i
won't
open
my
mouth.
if
i
lose,
out
they
go
and
i
start
over
again.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
difference
between
the
absence
of
jurisdiction
at
the
outset,
which
is
what
is
involved
when
you
have
a
plaintiff
from
the
same
state
as
the
defendant
which
can't
be
cured
by
the
plaintiff
moving
to
a
diverse
state,
and
imperfect
jurisdiction,
in
other
words,
that
you
do
have
diversity,
but
you
have
a
spoiler
in
the
picture.
that
is...
that
is
very
clear
in
caterpillar,
less
clear
in
the
partnership.
although
the
partners
are
five
individuals,
they
are
not
an
entity
the
way
a
corporation
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't...
it
was
sued.
it...
it
sued.
it
was
the
plaintiff,
wasn't
it?
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
only
if
the
court
says...
only
if
the
court
says
so
because
the
rule,
even
the
timely
filing
rule
was...
was
something
that
john
marshall
said
and
it's
been
that
way
ever
since,
with
exceptions
and
recognizing
that
a
human
individual
is
different
from
a
corporation
is
different
from
a
partnership.
if...
if
a
court
is
going
to
make
such
a
regime,
surely
it
would
make
a
sensible
one
and
not
one
that's
subject
to
abuse.
