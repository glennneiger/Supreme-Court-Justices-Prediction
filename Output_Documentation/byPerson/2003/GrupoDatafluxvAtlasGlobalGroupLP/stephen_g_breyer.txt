stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it?
i
mean,
imagine
the
worst
case.
a
lithuanian
sues
a
citizen
of
taiwan
in
new
york
on
july
1st.
on
july
2nd,
they
both
become
citizens.
well,
what
i'm
going
to
ask
is
what's
the
worst...
i
don't
see
a
constitutional
problem.
they
didn't
notice
till
after
judgment.
what's
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
if
we
were
to
say,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
if
you
like,
federal
policy,
there's
an
exception
to
the
time
of
filing
rule...
when
nobody
notices
until
after
the
judgment
is
entered...
to
prevent
manipulation?
what's
the
worst
thing
that
would
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
when
he
put
his
question,
was
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
in
fact
it's
noticed
before
the
trial
is
complete,
it
is
necessary
to
dismiss.
and
that
you
believe
the
answer
is,
one,
yes,
and
you
believe
that's
implicit
in
caterpillar
because
you
agree
with
what
justice
scalia
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who...
who
is
that
man?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
did
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
says
it's
the
opposite.
i
mean,
you...
you
could
do
that,
but
i
mean,
it's
very
clear
to
say
it
could
destroy
it;
no.
it
could
create
it;
yes.
i
mean,
that's
not
hard
to
understand,
and
there's
a
lot
of
authority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
they?
you
were
going
to
say.
