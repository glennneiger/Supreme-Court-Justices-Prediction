mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
asks
that
this
court
affirm
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
and
hold
that,
based
on
this
court's
precedent,
the
trial
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
trial
because
the
lack
of
complete
diversity
between
the
parties
was
cured
before
trial.
this
court
unanimously
held
in
caterpillar
that
if
the
jurisdictional
defect
is
cured
before
trial
and
then
a
case
is
tried
on
the
merits
and
the
court
has
article
iii...
it's
an
article
iii
court,
it
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
it
has
the
judicial
power
to...
to
preside
over--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--that's
correct.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
our
position
is
that
caterpillar
and
the
thread
through
caterpillar
of
newman-green
and
grubbs
points
out
that
that
is
not
an
issue
that
was
determinative
of
the
decision.
the
court
specified
unanimously
in
caterpillar
that
once
diversity
is
cured...
it
didn't
say
has
to
be
cured
a
certain
way.
it
didn't
say
has
to
be
cured
by
a
dispensable
party
leaving,
et
cetera.
it
said
simply
once
a
case
has
been
tried
and
diversity
obtained
at
the
time
of
trial,
that
the...
that--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--respectfully,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
our
position
is
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
much
narrower
than
caterpillar.
we
fall
under
the
umbrella
of
caterpillar.
here
we
did
not
have,
for
example,
as
in
caterpillar
a
mistaken
challenge
at
the
inception
of
the
case
that
the
court
decided
in
caterpillar
to
overlook
when
it
did
not
remand
the
case.
there
is
no
issue
of
that
ilk.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
know
if
the
record
reflects
that
issue,
but
answering
your
question,
i
don't
think
either
party
in
the
record
adverted
to
that
issue
until
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
by
grupo
dataflux.
therefore,
the
case
continued
on
from
filing
through
trial
to
verdict
without
either
party
adverting
to
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
a
jurisdictional
problem
until
after--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--justice
kennedy,
i
believe
so,
yes.
and
i...
and
i
believe
that
the
parties
on
either
side,
as
well
as
the
court
i
might
add,
if
the
court
learned
of
or
had
an
issue
would
have
brought
it
up,
but
i
think
certainly
counsel
had
an
ethical
duty
to
do
so.
the...
the
issue
before
you
is
whether
this
case
creates
a
new
or
different
exception
to
the
rule
of
time
of
filing,
and
we
posit
it
does
not
because
caterpillar,
contrary
to...
to
the
position
of
the
petitioner...
caterpillar
stands
for
the
propositions,
as
i
have
stated,
which
are
overwhelming
according
to
the
court.
finality
in
that
opinion,
costs
of
litigation,
litigants
waiting
in
line.
that
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
the
time
of
filing.
this
case
falls
within
much
narrower...
because
the
fifth
circuit
said,
if
it's
cured
before
trial
and
not
raised
till
after
trial,
then
that's
the
test.
that's
a
much
narrower
test.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
in
the...
in
the
view
of
the
fifth
circuit,
raised
before
trial...
cured
before
trial,
but
not
raised...
but
raised
after
is
what
the
court's
test
was.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
i
would...
would...
respectfully,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
think
before
trial
is...
is
the
last
time
it
can
be
raised
because
caterpillar
says
once
a
case
has
been
tried.
it's
very
clear.
and...
and
our...
in
this
case
atlas
was
tried
to
a
jury.
and
as
justice
ginsburg
correctly
pointed
out,
this
case
goes
right
back
to
the
same
court.
and
if
the
considerations
of
finality,
of
costs
of
litigation,
of
people,
litigants
waiting
in
line
to
have
their
cases
tried
is
to
have
any
meaning,
then
this
court
should
overlay
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
say,
well,
it
would
be
as
yogi
berra
said,
deja
vu
all
over
again,
just
to
go
try
this
case.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
the...
the
record
does
not.
the...
the
record
only
reflects
that
6...
6
months
before
the
trial,
the
two
mexican
partners
were
bought
out,
if
you
will,
were
no
longer
partners.
that
was
not
finalized
because
of
some...
it
was...
it
was
final
from
the
parties'
standpoint,
but
there
was
a
technical
need
for
some
document
from
the
nasd,
and
i'm
not
sure
that's
in
the
record,
that
that's
why
petitioner
says,
well,
it
was
really
only
finally
cured
a
month
before
trial.
but
nevertheless--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--no.
no,
your...
no,
justice
kennedy,
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
yes.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
that
is
not
in
the
record,
but
what
occurred
is
when
the
judge
dismissed
this
case
after
the
jury
trial,
the
thought
process
was,
well,
let's
start
anew
so
that
whatever
happens
on
appeal,
that
case
will
be
advanced
so
much
it
would
be
tried
right
away,
we
thought.
but
after
discussing
it
and
after
thinking
about
it,
we
didn't
want
two
cases
to
go
along
at
the
same
time.
so
we...
it...
we
dismissed
it
without
prejudice,
relying
on
whatever
happens
in
this
case.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
oh,
yes.
we
did
that
long
before
we
knew
what
the...
long
before
we
knew
what
the
outcome
or
the
briefing
was
in...
in
the...
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
mr.
boyce
is
a
bright
lawyer
and
i
don't
know
what's
in
his
mind,
but
as
for
me,
i
believe
there's
a
savings
clause
in
the
texas
statutory
scheme
that
upon
ruling
by
this
court,
if
it
were
not
to
uphold
the
fifth
circuit
and
this
case
had
to
be
refiled
in
district
court,
i...
i
believe
that
that
savings
clause
would
pertain
except...
except...
that
in
the
record
it
shows
that
new
york
law
is
to
apply
to
this
litigation.
and
i
don't
know
whether
new
york
substantive
law
would
apply
or
texas
procedural
law
would
apply.
my
coming
here
today,
of
course,
was
the
hope
of
an
affirmance
and
not
have
to
face
that
issue.
and--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--i'll
answer--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--and
the
issue
then
is
raised
after
the
trial?
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
i
would
respectfully
say
this,
not
only
do
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
rule
allows
that,
i
think
caterpillar
allows
that.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
i
think
caterpillar--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court,
would
allow
that
same
fact
situation,
but--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--i...
i
noted
in
caterpillar
at
page
11
that
the
court
cited
the
mcmahan
case
from
the
third
circuit
in
which
there
was
a
change
in
the
partnership
after
the
filing,
but
before
the
trial
so
as
to
empower
the
court
with
complete
diversity
and
the
court
had
the
judicial
power
to
decide
the
case.
i
take
it
that
if
this
court
in
its
unanimous
opinion
referred
to
the
mcmahan
case,
knop
v.
mcmahan,
that
it...
it
understood
that
change
in
that
case
and
did
not
dispute
the
fact,
therefore,
that
the
change
in
a
limited
partnership
is
acceptable
so
that
when
that
change
occurs
and
then
there
is
complete
diversity
and
then
there
is
a
trial,
that
the
court
has
the
article
iii
judicial
power
to
decide
the
case.
or
as...
or
as
justice
souter
said
in
lexicon,
while
not
on
all
fours
with
this
case
by
any
means,
there
was
no
continuing
defiance
but
merely
untimely
compliance.
in
this
case
there
was
no
continuing
defiance
of
the
court's
jurisdiction.
once
the
limited
partners
were
bought
out
of
the
limited
partnership,
this
court
acquired
the
power,
and
once
it
acquired
the
power,
the
lineage
of
cases,
the
thread
of
cases
from...
from
grubbs,
newman-green,
and
caterpillar
say
this
court
has
the
power
to
consider
that
case.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
yes,
that
is
true.
the
only
direct
filing
case...
you
are
correct,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
well...
and...
and
following
on
that,
but
of
course,
newman-green,
a
rule
21
case,
admittedly
is
very
instructive
here
because
newman-green...
the
court
gave
the
plaintiff
the
option
of
dismissing
the
dispensable
party.
the
plaintiff
took
the
option.
while
the
case
was
on
appeal,
the
appellate
court
gave
the
option.
the
plaintiff
dismissed
the
dispensable
party
and
the
court
said
okay,
we
had
jurisdiction
then
to
render...
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
then
to
render
summary
judgment
in
that
case.
the
plaintiff
could
have
turned
down
that
power
and
said,
no,
i
don't
want
to
lose
that
dispensable
party.
he
may
be
the
money
man.
he
may
be
the
one
that
i
can
come
after
later
on.
so
you
do
have
this
court
in
newman-green
approving,
if
you
will,
the
act
of
the
plaintiff
unilaterally
to
make
the
decision
whether
it's
going
to
stay
in
federal
court
or
in
that
case...
well,
stay
in
federal
court.
here,
there
are...
there
are...
the...
the
petitioner
raises
two
salient
issues:
removal
is
different
than
remand
and
this
was
unilateral.
i've
covered
the
unilateral
in
my
opinion,
and
i
will
say
one
final
thing
about...
subject
to
questions,
about
the
removal.
and
that
is
once
a
case
comes
to
this
court
by
removal
or
by
direct
filing,
the
jurisdictional
questions
are
the
same
at
that
point,
and
that
is,
is
there
diversity?
and
in
caterpillar,
it
said,
well,
there
wasn't
and
the
court
erroneously
ruled,
but
later
on
diversity
obtained
and
we
had
article
iii
jurisdictional
power
to
try
the
case.
i...
it's
like
coming
to
washington,
d.c.
by
train,
boat,
plane.
once
you
get
to
washington,
d.c.,
you're
subject
to
the
same
rules.
once
we
be...
came
before
the
federal
court
by
direct
filing,
or
once
caterpillar
in
the
removal
filing,
the
test
was
the
same.
we...
we
believe
this
is
a
very,
very
narrow
case.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
that...
justice
stevens,
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
once
the
court
acquires
the
power,
it
doesn't
lose
it
or
it
is
not
divested
by
the
actions
of
the
parties.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
respectfully,
justice
stevens,
it's
not
my
view.
it's
what
i
believe
caterpillar
says
because
caterpillar
speaks
of
a
case
having
been
tried.
the
words
are
cases
tried
on...
on...
and
i
hope
it's
page
11...
it...
it--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--i
think
the
court
would
have
to
dismiss
the
case.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
it
says,
having
been
tried.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
so
do
i.
so
i'm
agreeing
with
you.
i
think
the
court--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--yes.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
yes.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
that
is
correct.
that's
very
well
put
and
i
thank
you
very
much.
[laughter]
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
i
honestly
thought
that
was
my
answer.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
i
honestly
thought
that
was
my
answer.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
but...
but
i
also...
i
also
have
to
hasten
to
point
out
that
justice
ginsburg's
opinion
says
cured...
you
know,
if
it's
cured
before
trial.
in...
in
this
case,
it
was
cured
before
trial,
but
it
wasn't
raised
before
trial.
it
was
raised
after
the
trial.
we
fall
well
within
the
umbrella
of
caterpillar.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
under
rule
21,
if
they
were
dispensable,
yes.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
i
understand
the
question,
and
respectfully,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
say
that
rule
21,
newman-green,
and
caterpillar
does
allow
that.
i
would
say,
though,
on
the
other
hand,
that
there
are
other
checks
on...
on
the
ethics
of...
of
lawyers.
if
they
do
go
in
with
that
type
of
mental
frame
of
mind,
that
there
are
ethical
obligations,
and
you're
going
to
face
the
wrath
of
the
court.
the
court
may
have
a...
a
hearing,
for
example,
to
you...
for
you
to
show
cause
why
you
should
be
sanctioned
for
misrepresenting
things
to
the
court.
i'm
very
concerned
about
that.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
i'm
not
proposing
a
rule,
chief
justice--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--i'm
proposing
that...
that
this
case
on
its
facts
falls
within
the
exception
in
caterpillar.
i'm
not
advocating
any
new
rule.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
there
was
not
a
limited
partnership
in
caterpillar,
but
diversity
was
cured
before
trial
and
the
issue
was
not
raised
until
after
trial.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
respectfully,
justice
stevens,
i
do
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
rule...
the
time
of
filing
rule
is...
is
a
general
rule
and
it
has
been
subject
to
exception.
we
fall...
we...
this
case
falls
within
the
caterpillar,
newman-green,
grubbs
exception.
yes,
there
are
distinctions
in
the
factual
issues,
but
those
distinctions
are
without
a
difference
as
far
as
what
we
would
ask
this
court
to
do.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
respectfully,
justice
kennedy,
i
will
answer
your
question.
i...
i
do
not
think
it
opens
the
door
to
more
manipulation.
two
reasons.
number
one,
in
texas
the
general
partner
has
the
right
to
bring
lawsuits.
the
limited
partners
do
not
have
the
right
to
sue
or
be
sued
in
their
name
on
behalf
of
the
limited
partnership.
that's
a
very
important
distinction
here.
the...
the
second
point...
and
i
think
this
is
more
important...
the
precedent
of
this
court
does
not
discuss
intent.
caterpillar,
newman-green,
grubbs
did
not
talk
about
what
were
the
parties'
intent
at
the
time
that
the
jurisdictional
article
iii
power
came
to
this
court.
since
there
is
no
discussion
in
those
cases
of
intent,
it
is
my
reading
that
intent
is
not
an
issue.
it's
an
absolute.
did
the
court
have
jurisdiction
or
does
it
not?
and
i
think
there
are
checks
and
balances
on
lawyers
who
would
manipulate,
as
you
say,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
respectfully,
justice
scalia,
in
caterpillar
at
page
11,
there
are
overriding
considerations
to
those
analogies,
which
of
course
are
not
the
facts
here.
there's
no
showing
of
intent
here.
there's...
there's...
the
only
showing
is
neither
party
adverted
to
the
issue.
this
case
was
tried.
but--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--that's
correct.
in
this...
in
this
partnership,
there
were,
i
think,
two
corporations.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
it
was
a
sued
as
a
partnership.
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
yes,
and
two
individuals.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
atlas
sued--
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
--and
was
counterclaimed
against
by
dataflux
as
an
entity,
and
then
dataflux
third-partied
in
the
two
mexican
individuals.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
according
to
carden
v.
arkoma,
justice
scalia,
the
way
i
read
it,
the
jurisdiction
did
not
obtain
at
the
time
of
filing.
that
was
only
cured
later,
but
the
overriding
consideration
in
caterpillar
unanimously
by
this
court
is
once
a
diversity
case
has
been
tried
in
federal
court,
with
the
rules
of
decisions
under
state
law,
under
erie
v.
tompkins,
considerations
of
finality,
efficiency,
and
economy
become
overwhelming.
if
i
have
to
take
those
words
as
they
are,
they
are
overwhelming,
then
it
is
overwhelming
in
this
case
because
this
case
is
narrower
than
caterpillar.
why
send
this
case
back?
i
would
ask
this
court...
these
principles
apply
regardless
of
whether
the
case
arrives
to
federal
court
through
removal
or
original
filing.
i
would
ask
this
court,
on
behalf
of
the
respondent,
that
this
court
apply
these
principles
to
conclude
that
the
trial
court
in
this
case
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
trial,
and
allow
this
case
to
return
the
district
court
for
entry
of
judgment
consistent
with
the
jury
verdict.
mr.
roger
b.
greenberg
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
give
back
the
court
my...
the
balance
of
my
time.
