there...
if
there

an
adjudication

that's

from

otherwise,
there
wouldn't
be
a
conflict
in
the

the
way
there
is.
certainly
there
are
significant
similarities
but
there
are
differences
too.

you
have
a
very
definite
period.
now,
this
is
an
exception.
and
when
is
the...
under
the
rule
of
the
exception,
when
is
the
last
time
this

i'm
glad
to
know
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if...
if
the
rule
you're
proposing
kind
of
invites
the
sort
of
conduct
that
you
say
is
prohibited,
maybe
there's
something
wrong
with
the
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're...
you're
proposing
a
rule
that
is
derived,
you
say,
from
caterpillar.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
except
that
there
was
not
a
limited
partnership
in
