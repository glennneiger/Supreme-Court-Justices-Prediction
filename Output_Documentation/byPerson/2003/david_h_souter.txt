justice
souter
all
right.
let...
if
i
may,
let
me
interrupt
you
there.
do
you
concede
that
the
state
has
any
rights
under
article
vii
of
the
compact?
justice
souter
the
state,
the
state
of
virginia,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
article...
article
vii
talks
about
citizens.
justice
souter
it
doesn't
talk
about
the
commonwealth.
justice
souter
well,
is
that...
i
mean,
is
that
a
premise
of
your
argument?
justice
souter
do
you...
do
you
also
deny
that
the
state
with
respect
to
withdrawal
of
water
for
its
citizens
that
the...
do
you
deny
that
the
state
stands
in
the
shoes
of
its
citizens?
justice
souter
no.
i
realize
that,
but
are
you
denying
that
it
may
properly
do
that?
justice
souter
so,
in
effect,
are
you
saying
the
state...
it...
it
is
just
as
though
the
state
had
express
rights
under
article
vii
because
in
making
the
claim
that
it's
making,
it
stands
in
the
shoes
of
its
citizens,
and
its
citizens
do
have
rights.
is...
is
that...
do
you
concede
that?
justice
souter
then
it's
irrelevant
that
the...
that
article
vii
speaks
only
of
citizens
and
not
of
the
state.
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
then
what...
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
souter
what
do
you
make...
and
i
don't
have
this
in
front
of
me,
so
maybe
i...
i'm
missing
something.
but
i
thought
the
black-jenkins
award
also
put
a...
included
a
disclaimer
that
it
wasn't,
in
fact,
modifying
anything
in
the
1785
compact.
am
i
right?
justice
souter
how...
i'm
sorry.
assuming
that
then,
how
do
we
get
from
the
language
of
article
vii
in
the
compact
that
refers
to
citizens
to
the
language
in
black-jenkins
that
talks
about
the
states?
