mr.
baida
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
state
of
maryland
has
the
authority
to
regulate
virginia
and
its
citizens
when
they
seek
to
place
structures
in
and
withdraw
water
from
the
potomac
river.
first,
as
confirmed
by
the
black-jenkins
award
of
1877
and
this
court's
decision
in
morris
v.
united
states,
the
state
of
maryland
is
and
has
been
the
owner
of
the
potomac
river
since
1632,
and
maryland
has
never--
mr.
baida
--correct,
we
are
not.
maryland
is
and
has
been
the
owner
of
the
river,
and
it
has
never
relinquished
the
sovereign
authority
that
its
title
to
the
river
gives
it
to
regulate
what
takes
place
on
and
over
the
bed.
and
the
second
reason--
mr.
baida
--it's
not
the
privilege
of
making
and
carrying
out
orders,
justice
o'connor,
although
that
privilege
would
seem
to
apply
to
building
something
into
the
river
to
exercise
a
riparian
right,
and
there
is
a
riparian
right
to
withdraw
water.
mr.
baida
no,
justice
o'connor.
we...
we
have
never
taken
that
position.
mr.
baida
that
virginia
has
riparian
rights
with
respect
to
the
potomac
river.
mr.
baida
correct.
mr.
baida
correct.
mr.
baida
correct.
mr.
baida
subject
to
a
standard
of
reasonableness,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
baida
it's--
mr.
baida
--no.
it's
assessed
by
the
fact
that
maryland
owns
the
river,
but
that
virginia,
as...
as
a
riparian
owner,
has
rights
with
respect
to
the
river
that
maryland
must
be
reasonable
with
respect
to
which
in
its
regulations.
mr.
baida
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
baida
and...
and--
mr.
baida
--and--
mr.
baida
--the
river,
justice
scalia,
is
entirely
within
the
state
of
maryland,
and
that
is
undisputed
from
the...
the
language
of
the
maryland
charter
back
from
1632.
the
entire
river
is
in
maryland.
mr.
baida
maryland's
ownership
of
the
potomac
gives
it
to
right...
gives
it
the
right
to
regulate
what
takes
place
on
and
over
the
bed.
there
are
riparian
rights,
but
as
this
court
has
recognized,
those
riparian
rights
have
always
been
subject
to
government
regulation.
mr.
baida
there--
mr.
baida
--it's
about
both.
mr.
baida
yes.
mr.
baida
it's...
it's
about
both.
the
right
to
build
into
the
potomac
which
the
compact--
mr.
baida
--yes,
because--
mr.
baida
--the...
the
objection
is
simply
that
maryland
has
the
right
to
regulate
what
takes
place
in
its
territory,
and
what
takes
place--
mr.
baida
--i
think
that's
a
different
question.
that's--
mr.
baida
--if
they're
taking...
if
they
are...
the
low-water
mark
on
the
virginia
side--
mr.
baida
--but
i'm
trying
to
understand
the
nature
of
your
question,
justice
breyer.
when
they
build
a
hole,
are
they
building
the
hole
in
virginia?
mr.
baida
so
they're
building
a
trench
in
virginia.
mr.
andrew
h.
baida
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
baida
maryland
may
have
some
objections
to
that
at
some
future
point
in
time,
but
that's
activity
that's
taking
place
in
virginia.
mr.
baida
well,
that
may...
that...
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
actually
change
the--
mr.
baida
--that
imposes
restrictions
on
the
three
major
users
of
the
potomac
river,
the
washington
aqueduct,
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
the...
the
fairfax
county
water
authority
and
the
washington
sanitary...
suburban
sanitary
commission,
and
imposes
limitations
on
the
amount
of
water
that
they
can
take--
mr.
baida
--in
periods
of
low
flow.
mr.
baida
subject
to
a
permitting
system
that
was
in
place
at
the
time
and
still
is
in
place.
and
the
only
permitting
system
that's
ever
been
in
place
with
respect
to
the
potomac
river
has
been
the
permitting
system
established
by
the
state
of
maryland.
and
i
think
i'd
like
to
just
go
back
to
the
initial
point
i
tried
to
make
at
the
beginning,
which
is
why
maryland
has
the
right
to
do
what
it's
doing
here.
mr.
baida
well,
the
maryland
administrative
and
judicial
review
proceedings
answered
that
question
no--
but
the
reason
why
maryland
took
the...
the
action
that
it
did
was
because
fairfax
county
already
had
an
existing
waterway
intake
pipe
in
the...
in
the
river.
they
wanted
to
build
another
intake
pipe
725
feet
into
the
river,
and
the
edge
of
it
would
be
30
inches
above
water
with
a
5-foot
walkway.
maryland
took
the
position
let's
see
if
there
are
less
intrusive
alternatives
that
are
available.
virginia
wanted
to
do
this.
fairfax
county
wanted
to
do
this
because
it
was
concerned
about
the
effect
of
the...
the
water
on
the
shoreline
which
is
where
the
existing
intake
pipe
was
and
wanted
to
get
cleaner
water
from
the...
from
the
middle
of
the
river.
and
so
maryland
took
the
view,
well,
let's
see
if
there
are
less
intrusive
alternatives
available,
and--
mr.
baida
--maryland
had
no
objection
to
the
fairfax
county
water
authority
withdrawing
water.
maryland's
objection
was
to
minimize
the
impact
on
the
potomac
river.
mr.
baida
yes,
it
is.
mr.
baida
because
the
riparian
rights
that--
mr.
baida
--well,
there
was...
that
was
part
of
it
because
it...
it
was
in
the
scenic
portion
of
the
potomac
river.
mr.
baida
what
the...
what
the
compact
does,
justice
scalia,
is
it
provides
that
the
potomac
river
could
be
used
as
a
common
highway
by
the
citizens
of
both
states,
and
it
also
secures
important
private
property
rights.
private
property
rights,
again
for
the
citizens
of
both
states.
mr.
baida
that
the
states?
mr.
baida
that--
mr.
baida
--that's
exactly
what
this
court
has
said
in--
mr.
baida
--yes.
mr.
baida
the...
the
state...
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
brought
this
action
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
to
seek--
mr.
baida
--no.
no,
we
are
not.
mr.
baida
yes.
the...
we've
never
denied
that
the--
mr.
baida
--no,
it's
not
irrelevant,
justice--
mr.
baida
--because
all
that
the
compact
does,
it
secures...
it...
it
makes
a...
there
is...
the
compact
drafters
recognized
the
difference
between
jurisdiction
and
sovereignty
and
private
property
rights,
and
when
they
wanted
to,
they
knew
exactly
how
to
go
about
addressing
issues
of
sovereignty.
mr.
baida
yes.
and
we...
maryland's
view
is
that
that
part
of
the
award
confirms
maryland's
rights
over
the
river.
and
i'd
like
to
explain
this
a
little
bit
more
fully.
what
the
black-jenkins
arbitrators
did
was
they
rejected
virginia's
claim
to
any
right
in
the
soil...
any
right
in
the
soil...
beyond
the
water
mark,
any
right
to
any
of
the
islands
in
the
river,
and
any
right
to
any
part
of
the
bed
of
the
river.
now--
mr.
baida
--and
the
presumption,
justice
o'connor,
is
overcome
by
looking
at
the
rest
of
the
award,
and
what
the...
the
arbitrators
did,
they
did
give
virginia
title
to
the
middle
of
other
bodies
of
water,
namely
the...
the
tangier
sound,
the
pocomoke
sound,
and
the
pocomoke
river.
but
they
specifically
rejected--
mr.
baida
--the
arbitrators
said
that
virginia
has
full
dominion
over
this
right
in
the
soil
up
to
low-water
mark,
but
beyond
that
point,
virginia
only
has
a
right
to
use
the
river.
a
right
of
use
is
not
dominion,
it's
not
title,
it's
not
sovereignty.
mr.
baida
a
right
of
use,
justice
scalia,
is
subject
to
governmental
authority
and
regulation,
and
that's
exactly
what
this
court
said--
mr.
baida
--this
court
has
said
in,
for
example,
massachusetts
v.
new
york
that
massachusetts'
right
to
use
lake
ontario
was
still
subject
to
the
regulatory
authority
of
new
york
because
new
york
had
title
to
the
bed
of
lake
ontario.
mr.
baida
the...
maryland
is
to
treat
them
identically,
and
that's
set
forth
clearly
in
article
vii
of
the
compact.
mr.
baida
not...
not
if
it
has
any
kind
of
adverse
impact
from
maryland's
perspective,
whether
it's
in
maryland...
if...
if
the
city
of
rockville
wanted
to
do
this,
it
would
encounter
presumably
exactly
the
same
kind
of
reaction
that
fairfax
county
initially
did.
mr.
baida
yes.
mr.
baida
no,
and
this
court
said
in
yates
v.
milwaukee
that...
that
the
riparian
right
cannot
be
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
denied.
and
that--
mr.
baida
--well,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
baida
--i...
i
think
it's
again
set
forth
in
yates
v.
milwaukee
where
the
court
said
that
a
state
cannot...
or
a
government...
municipality
cannot
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
deny
someone
the
exercise
of
a
riparian
right.
mr.
baida
yes.
i
think...
i
mean,
it's
a
property
right.
it
is
a
property
right,
and
it
can't
be
arbitrarily--
mr.
baida
--yes.
and
just
so
i'm
clear,
justice
kennedy,
the
rule
of
law,
not
administrative
hyperbole,
is
what
governed
the
judicial
and
the
administrative
review
proceedings
that
led
to
fairfax
county
getting
this
waterway
intake
pipe
permit.
i
mean,
it...
there
was...
it
went
through
the
process.
maryland
thought
it
had
valid
reasons
for
restricting
the...
the
permit,
and
maryland
was...
was
overruled,
and
the
permit
has
since
issued.
and
so
this
is
not
a
case
of
maryland
just
arbitrarily
deciding,
well,
we
don't
like
what's
happening
over
there,
and...
and
then--
mr.
baida
--and
i
think
it's
also
required
by
the
constitution.
mr.
baida
i
think
the
due
process
clause.
maryland
just
can't
arbitrarily
and...
and
capriciously
deprive
someone
of
a
property
right.
mr.
baida
no.
and...
and
again,
it's
because
of
what
maryland
gave
up
in
this
compact
and...
and
what
the
black-jenkins
award
provided.
and
again,
we
have
to
go
back...
and
the...
the
problem
with...
with
the
special
master's
recommendation
from
maryland's
perspective
is
that
he
began
at
the
wrong
place
in
history.
he
began
with
the
compact.
he
should
have
begun
with
the
charter
because
the
plain
language
of
the
charter
gives
maryland
this
river,
and...
and
so
the
question
at
that
point,
since
maryland
owns
this
river,
maryland
does
have
sovereign
authority
over
it.
so--
mr.
baida
--justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
flaw
in
the
reasoning
is
that
it
ignores
the
plain
language
of
the
charter
which
this
court
said
includes
the
potomac
river
in
unmistakable
terms
to
the
further
bank.
it
doesn't
matter
what
kind
of
competing
claims
existed
as
of
1785
when
the
compact
was
written.
what
matters
is
who
had
title,
and
under
virginia's
view,
maryland
was
a...
this...
maryland
was
basically
a
deed
holder.
this
was
a
royal
deed,
and
under
virginia's
view,
this
royal
deed
could
not
create
rights
until
it
was
interpreted
by
either
the
arbitrators
or
this
court.
mr.
baida
which
this
court
noted
did
not
do
anything
to
divest
maryland
of
the
authority
it
had
under
the...
maryland
was
first
in
time.
first
in
line,
first
in
time.
and
so
it
had
it
in
1632.
there
was
a
subsequent
deed
that
was
given
by--
mr.
baida
--but
in...
yes,
in
1609
virginia
was
initially
set
up
but
then
its
charter
was
annulled
in
1624.
it
converted
to
a
royal
colony
which
meant
that
king
charles
i
in
1632
had
the
right
to
carve
maryland
out
of
virginia,
which
is
what
he
did.
he
created
maryland
as
a
proprietorial
colony.
at
that
point,
the
only
way
that
maryland
could
lose
any
rights
it
had
under
its
charter
was
through
a
quo
warranto
proceeding.
it
was
initiated
in
1685.
it
never
resulted
in
anything,
as
the
arbitrators
in
1877
noted.
and
so
maryland--
mr.
baida
--no,
i'm
not
saying
the
compact
was
wrong
at
all,
mr.
chief--
mr.
baida
--no.
the...
i
think...
all...
all
i'm
saying
is
that
maryland
had
this
authority
as
a
result
of
the
plain
language
in
the
charter.
mr.
baida
no.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
that
document...
of...
of
the...
the
1785
compact
and
the
1877
award
was
that
reasonable
minds
may
have
differed.
and
so
the
states
decided
this
is
how
we're
going
to
address
issues
of
navigation.
mr.
baida
if
i
said
that,
let
me
retrieve
it
immediately
because
that
was
not
what
i
meant
to
say.
[laughter]
what
i...
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
maryland's
title
has
not
changed
one
iota
in
almost
400
years.
mr.
baida
i
agree,
justice
scalia,
but
it
goes
a
long
way
in
resolving
that
question
because
by
acknowledging
that...
that
the
boundary
is
not
in
dispute,
by
acknowledging
that
maryland
does,
indeed,
have
title
to
this
river,
virginia
has
acknowledged
maryland's
regulatory
authority--
mr.
baida
--correct.
mr.
baida
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
compact
is
that
both
states
agreed
that
they
couldn't
agree
on
where
the
boundary
was,
and
so
they
decided--
mr.
baida
--and...
and--
mr.
baida
--and
i
think
that
both
states
agreed
that
wherever
the
boundary
was,
the
citizens
of
both
states
would
have
the
same
rights
of
access
to
the
river.
and...
and
for
that
reason,
they...
they--
mr.
baida
--i
think
that
the...
the
view...
a
fair
reading
would
be
that
wherever
the
boundary
was--
mr.
baida
--if...
if
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
boundary
is
on
virginia's
side,
yes,
maryland
gets
to
decide
because
it's
activity
occurring
in
maryland.
this
is
maryland--
mr.
baida
--not
if
virginia
does
not
own
the
potomac.
and
i'd
like
to--
mr.
baida
--no,
because
that's
settled
by
article...
i
think
article
viii
of
the
compact.
mr.
baida
i
would.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
baida
prior
to
this
case,
virginia
has
never
taken
the
position
that
it
has
any
authority
to
take
any
kind
of
regulatory
action
at
all
with
respect
to
piers
and
wharfs
beyond
the
water
mark.
and
in
fact,
what
virginia
has
done
is
it
has
sent
hundreds
of
its
citizens
to
maryland
and
it
has
told
its
citizens
that
their
construction
projects
from
the
virginia
side
of
the
potomac
river
fall
outside
of
virginia's
jurisdiction
but
fall
within
maryland's
because
maryland
owns
the
bed
of
the
river.
that
ownership
gives
maryland
the
right,
putting
aside
just
for
the
moment
any
agreements...
it
gives
maryland
the
right
to
regulate
withdrawals
of
water
from
maryland.
and
so
what
we're
left
with
at
this
moment
is
article
vi,
the
fourth
paragraph,
of
the
black-jenkins
award,
and
it
says
it
does
give
virginia
full
dominion
over
the
right
in
the
soil,
but
justice
scalia,
i
would
disagree
it
gives
virginia
any
sovereign
rights
to
use
the
river
beyond
that
point
because
if
it
gave
virginia
the
unrestricted
right
to
use
the
potomac
river
beyond
that
point,
that's
called
quiet
title.
that
means
virginia
gets
to
do
what
it
wants.
maryland
can't
regulate
it,
and
this
court
said
in
idaho
v.
coeur
d'alene
tribe
that
that
kind
of
regulatory
action,
if
unrestricted,
is
the
equivalent
of
a
quiet
title
action.
the
black-jenkins
arbitrators
rejected
virginia's
claim
to
any
title
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
they
set
virginia's
boundary
at
low-water
mark
on
the
virginia
side.
they
could
have
done
the
boundary
line.
they
could
have
drawn
it
around
the
piers
and
wharfs.
they
showed
an
unbelievable
dexterity
in
drawing
the
boundary
through
smith
island.
they
went
from
the
bottom
of
the
chesapeake
bay
up
through
the
bottom
third
of
smith
island
and
back
down
again.
they
didn't
do
that
on
the
virginia
side
of
the
potomac.
they
set
low-water
mark
on
virginia's
side.
title
to...
virginia
has
title
to
low-water
mark,
but
only
a
right
of
use
beyond
that
point.
it
has
not
an
unrestricted
right
of
use.
the
right
of
us
is
subject
to
governmental
authority.
the
government
that
gets
to
regulate
it
is
the
government
that
owns
it.
thank
you.
