justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
the
argument
is
the
other
way.
i
mean,
it's
that
very
often
major
pieces
of
legislation
are
enacted
in
the
form
of
what
looks
like
an
amendment
of
a
current
statute.
i
think
of
the
celler-kefauver
act.
i
mean,
on
your
theory,
all
of
merger
law
would
really
be
viewed
as
not
a
new
statute
when
it
was
totally
new.
there
were
no
merger
cases
to
speak
of
prior
to
celler-kefauver.
and
then
they
come
in
and
section
7
applies
to
assets
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
merger
law.
well,
on
your
view
that
would
be
just
viewed
as...
as
if
it
were
some
kind
of
trivial
amendment
when
it
created
half
of
anti-trust
law.
i
mean,
you
see,
that's
the
kind
of
problem
i
think...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
reconcile
it
by
saying
if
it's
a
new...
you
look
at
the
act
of
congress.
an
act
of
congress
is
called
public
law
3278
or
whatever
it
is,
and
if
prior
to
that
act
of
congress,
you
didn't
have
the
cause
of
action,
and
if
after
you
did,
well,
that's
what
they
mean.
it
arises
under
a
new
act
of
congress.
that
seems
pretty
simple.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
give
you
any...
oh,
now,
now,
all
right...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
that...
if
you're
asking
me
the
question,
i'd
answer
that
question
by
saying,
of
course,
they
intended
a
private
right
of
action
to
apply.
i
mean,
now
let's
go
into
the
history
of
it
and
see
whether
they
did
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
think...
i
think
that
by
the...
but
that's
a
different
issue.
but
in
my
way
of
thinking,
that
doesn't
raise
a
serious
question
because
i
don't
believe
that
they
didn't
intend
to
raise...
to
have
this
as
a
private
right
of
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
engrafting
it
on
and
before
they
passed
the
act
of
congress,
you
did
not
have
this
kind
of
cause
of
action,
and
after
they
wrote
the
new
act,
you
did
have
it.
justice
breyer
therefore...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look...
look
at
your
own
interpretation.
answer
this
one
if
you
can.
i
mean,
i
don't
know.
i'm
just
thinking
about
it.
but
congress
passes
a
new
statute.
it's
called
new,
new,
new.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
in
a
special
code,
title
78,
just
to
be
new.
and
it
says
this...
and
this
is
total
new
and
here
is
what
it
is.
we
have
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
a
claim
for
double
damages
for
anyone
who
has
been
injured
by
a
robbery
committed
with
a
gun.
and
then
it
says,
robbery
shall
be
defined
as
it
is
defined
in
title
18,
section
391.
and
now,
a
gun...
that's
new
here,
but
we
define
that...
you
see
what
i'm
doing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
reproducing.
now,
how
are
you
going
to
take
that?
is
that
new,
new,
new?
justice
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
it
refers
to
the
old
one,
you
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
get
three
of
the
elements
from...
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
can
do
it
by
a
cross
reference.
in
other
words,
in
your
view,
if
it's
done
to...
through
a
cross
reference,
they
are
still
new,
new,
new,
but
it's
done
by
a
physical
placement,
it's
old,
old,
old.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
wouldn't
all
these
problems
exist
with
your
system
just
as
much
if
all
that
has
to
happen
to
make
it
valid
under
your
system
is
we
take
these
same
words,
making
appropriate
modification,
stick
them
in
title
75
and
call
it
new,
new,
new?
i
mean,
at
that
point
we're
going
to
have
the
same
problem
with
the
15
versus
the
25,
wouldn't
we?
justice
breyer
i
mean...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
because
it
would
only
apply
to
the
25,
you
see...
or
the
15.
it
wouldn't
apply
to
the
25.
justice
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
since
it's
the
same
language,
you
see
we
discover
that
small
industry
would
be
subject
to
the
4-year
statute,
but
the
larger
firm
would
be
subject
to
the
old
statute,
just
exactly
what
you're
complaining
about
under
their
interpretation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
wrong
about
that?
