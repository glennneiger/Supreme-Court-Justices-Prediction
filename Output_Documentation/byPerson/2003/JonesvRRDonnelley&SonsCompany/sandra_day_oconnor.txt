mr.
garre,
as
has
already
been
pointed
out,
the
interpretation
does
give
rise
to
some
anomalies
and
interpreting
it
the
other
way
might
as
well.
what
could
congress
have
provided
in
section
1658(a)
to
avoid
some
of
these
questions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
could
it
have
been
written...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
wouldn't
be
in
this
mess?
