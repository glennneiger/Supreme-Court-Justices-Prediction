mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
propositions
that
arise
out
of
the
conversation
of
the
past
25
minutes.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
single
uniform
meaning
of
the...
of
the
expression,
arising
under.
it
is
not
a
term
of
art.
it
is
a
term
of
chaos.
it
is
a...
it
is
a
phrase
that
is
used
repeatedly
in
different
contexts,
routinely
used
with
a
very
pragmatic...
in
a
very
pragmatic
fashion
and
does
not
answer
the
question
whether
or
not
congress,
when
it
adopted
1658,
or
congress,
when
it
amended
section
1981,
really
envisioned
this
kind
of
expansive
interpretation
that
would
allow
an
argument
to
be
made
that
state
laws
are
suddenly
subject
to
statutes
of
limitations.
as
justice
scalia
asked,
when
you
make
other
kinds
of
adjustments
in
these
schemes,
are
you
going
to
have
to
resolve
every...
every
one
of
these
issues?
i
mean,
the
question
with
respect
to
the
split
in
the
circuits.
there
is
currently
pending
a
proposed
change
to
the
air
carriers
access
act
that
specifically
resolves
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
between
the
eleventh
circuit
which
says
there
is
no
cause
of
action
and
other
circuits
that
says
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
these
aren't
hypotheticals.
these
are
real
issues
and
if
this
court
is
not
careful
in
how
it
tries
to
confine
the
interpretation
of
section
1658,
it's
going
to
be
interpreting
the
statute
for
the
better
part
of
the
next
10
years,
which
may
be
good
news
for
me
as
a
practitioner
before
the
court.
but
i'm
quite
certain
that
it's
not
good
news
either
for
my
clients,
for
the
lower
courts
that
are
going
to
have
to
adjudicate
these
problems
or
for...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
might
be
an
adequate
solution,
justice
scalia,
except
that
it's
not
self-evident
from
the
language,
arising
under.
the
question
is
what...
what
is
the
use
of
arising
under
that
you're
going
to
try
to
apply
in
a
more
or
less
uniform
fashion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
there...
and
i
don't
think
there's
support
for
that
objective
in...
in
this
particular
statute
because
if
congress
really
meant...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no.
it's
a
question
of...
i
mean,
they...
they
obviously
made
a...
a
compromise,
but
the
question
is
why
isn't
it
as
reasonable
a
compromise
to
say,
look,
we're
going
to
deal
with
this
in
the
truly
classic
sense
of
the
word
prospective.
every
new
self-contained
statute
that
goes
into
effect
is
now
subject
to
this
rule.
and...
and
literally,
as
justice
kennedy
said...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
do
that
every
day.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
justice
souter,
the...
the
reality
is
that
this
is
far
more
common
than
you
think.
the
anti-terrorism
statute
has
specific
standalone
causes
of
action.
the
muhammad
ali
reform...
boxing
reform
act
has
a
standalone
cause
of
action.
i
mean,
there
are,
in
fact
a
host
of
statutes
in
which
congress
does
precisely
what
the
other
side
claims
it
rarely
does.
i
mean,
this...
if...
if
the
court
would
like
us
to
provide
a
list,
we'd
be
happy
to
do
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no,
i
understand
that,
but
the
problem
you
still
have,
justice
breyer,
is
that
you've
got
to
figure
out
how
do
you
try
to
reconcile...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's...
that's
pretty
simple,
justice
breyer,
but
it
doesn't
answer
justice
kennedy's
question
which
is
if
you
look
at
this
particular
act
of
congress,
which
is
codified
in
subsection
(b),
it
doesn't
give
you
any
basis
for
a
right
of
action.
the
infrastructure...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
definitional
provision
doesn't
remotely...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but,
justice
breyer,
that's...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i
still...
but
that
still
doesn't
answer
what...
what
strikes
me
as
the
fundamental
question
which
is
when
congress
approached
section
1981,
did
it
think
that
it
was,
in
fact,
creating
a
whole
new
infrastructure
cause
of
action
or
was
it
basically
simply
engrafting
it
back
onto
what
section
1981
has
been
since
1866.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but
you...
but,
justice
breyer,
you
only
have
this
cause
of
action
because
four...
three
of
the
four
elements
arise
and
existed
long
before
1991,
and
those...
and
that...
and
it
clearly
has
to
arise
under
that
portion
of
it
as
well.
so
the
question
is,
if
it
arises
under
both,
what's
the
right
resolution
of
the
question?
and
the
point
that,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
petitioner
and
the
united
states
have
never
responded
to
is
why
it
you
would
adopt
a
rule
that
carries
with
it
as
much
complication
and
complexity
as
the
rule
that
they
propose
when
you
don't
have
to
come
out
that...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
wanted
it
to
have
maximum
effect.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
statute
applies
on
a
regular
basis
to
almost
everyday
acts
that
congress
adopts
in
which
they
provide
a
cause
of
action
and
do
not
provide
a
statute
of
limitations.
and
that
spares
this
court
and
every
other
court
the
burden
of
having
to
borrow
from
state
law,
trying
to
figure
out
what
analogous
state
law
claims
would
be
used
as
the
basis
for
a
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
except
that
i
think,
for
the
most
part,
the
courts
have
pretty
well
resolved
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
respect
to
section
1981.
i
would
have
thought
the
problem...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
difficult
to
know
whether
congress
meant
to
change
that.
i...
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
but
i...
but
it
still
seems
to
me
the
more
fundamental
problem
in
trying
to
sort
out
what
congress
did
with
respect
to
section
1981
is
that
it
never
intended
to
make
this
into
a
brand
new
infrastructure.
it
took
the
existing
four
elements.
it
didn't
change
a
single
word
in
section
1981
when
it
implemented
this
cause
of
action.
so
the
notion
that
this
is
a
cause
of
action
that
arises
only
under
the
1990
act
is
clearly...
under
the
1991
act
is
clearly...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i...
i
think
every
court
that
has
adopted
that
test...
certainly
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
and
other
courts
of
appeals
have
recognized
that
it
is
an
infinitely
simpler
test
than
trying
to
figure
out
what
arising
under
will
mean
in
all
of
its
various
permutations
and
new
statutes.
all
you
have
to
look
at
is
to
see
whether
or
not
the
cause...
the
elements...
all
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
are
newly
created.
that
may
be
embodied
in
a...
in
an
amendment
to
an
existing
statute.
it
may
be
on
a
standalone
basis.
but
i...
i
submit
to
you
that
is
a
significantly
simpler
course
to
follow.
and,
indeed,
i
don't...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
on
a
prospective
basis,
there's
no
question
about
that,
that
the
congress
had
passed
the
anti-terrorism
act
that
created
a
new
cause
of
action,
did
not
want
the
kind
of
inherent
inequalities
that
arise
under
borrowing
to
go
forward.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
says
nothing
about
what
the
congress
did
retroactively.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i...
justice
ginsburg,
your
own
hypotheticals
suppose
exactly
how
many
complexities
are
going
to
arise,
and
i...
i
can
assure
you
that
as...
as
much
imagination
as
we've
put
into
this,
plaintiffs'
counsels
and
defense
counsel
going
forward
will
try
even
harder
to
end
up
fighting
these
issues
in
terms
of
the...
in
terms
of
complex
this
is.
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
second
certified
class
in
this
case.
the
district
judge
in
this
case
thought
this
was
an
easy
statute
to
interpret
and
applied
it
to
classes
1
and
3.
when
he
got
to
class
2,
what
did
he
say?
he
said,
with
respect
to
those
claims
with
regard
to
part-time
employment,
the
parties
are
going
to
have
to
sort
that
out
themselves.
he
made
no
attempt
to
sort...
to
resolve
that
issue
because
it
is
a
completely
imponderable
question
under
their
interpretation
of
section
1658.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
of
course.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
of
course,
that's
a
new,
new,
new
cause
of
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but,
of
course,
that
doesn't
change...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
doesn't
change
anything,
justice
breyer.
of
course,
you
can
refer
back
to
it.
the
question
is
are
all
of
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
independently
provided
for
in
the
new,
new,
new
statute,
and
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
it's
that
simple,
justice
breyer.
if
it's
done
where
congress
means
to
create
a
new
infrastructure
and
a
new
cause
of
action,
it's
new,
new,
new.
when
congress
does
nothing
more
than
engraft
and
doesn't
even
remotely
modify
the
existing
infrastructure,
it
doesn't
even
so
much
as
change
the
words
of
a
statute
that's
been
here
from
1866,
to
suggest
that
this
is
a...
a
suit
that
arises
solely
under...
under
a
1991
amendment
seems
to
me
wrong.
the...
the
other
point
i
think
it's
important
to
make
in
this
connection...
and...
and
it's
the
rule
of
construction
that
seems
to
get
lost
sight
of...
is...
and...
and
it's
the
one
this
court
adopted
in
wilson
v.
garcia...
is
that
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
would
mean
for
the...
to
have
two
causes...
two
statutes
of
limitation
apply
to
the
same
cause
of
action
when
it
was
interpreting
section
1983.
and
here
we
have
a
situation
where
you
will
have
two...
two
statutes
of
limitation
applying
to
the
same
words
in
the
same
subsection
of
a
statute.
and
we
raised
the
issue
in
our...
in
our
brief
for
the
respondent
saying,
find
us
a
statute
where
congress
has
ever
allowed
that
kind
of
morass
to
exist,
and...
and
the
reply
brief
is
utterly
silent
on
that.
and
for
good
cause,
because
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
would
have
adopted
that
interpretation.
and
therefore,
if
you
follow
the
rule
of
construction
from
wilson
v.
garcia
and
if
you
accept
what
i
think
you
cannot
help
but
except,
which
is
that
arising
under
is
not
an
unambiguous
line...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
is
it
irrational?
yes.
is
it
unconstitutional?
probably
not
under
the
standards
that
loosely
govern
these
kinds
of
issues
unless
somebody
can
attach
it
to
some
kind
of...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
if
there
were
a
1981(d)
that
was...
that
was
separately
contained
and
that
expressed
a
clear
indication
from
congress
that
it
really
meant
to
create
a
new
cause
of
action,
that
it
would
make
sense
under
those
circumstances
for
1658
to
apply
to
that
particular
situation.
but
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
simply
trying
to
ascertain
congress'
intent,
and
i
think
whether
you
look
at
it
under
section
1981's
lens
or
if
you
look
at
it
under
section
1658's
lens,
you
end
up
at
exactly
the
same
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's...
to
be
sure.
and
it
goes
back,
i
suppose,
to
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
other
side
which
is
that
there's
a
default
rule
and
congress
can
always
change
it.
the
core
of
this
is
congress
can
always
make
its
intent
more
explicit
in
terms
of
how
it
deals
with
the
problem.
the
question
is,
do
you
want
to
create
a
regime
in
which
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
be
resolving
questions
involving
the
meaning
of
section
1658
for
the
foreseeable
future?
or
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
recognize
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a...
a
complete
set
of
causes
of
action
to
which
1658
will
routinely
apply
and
that
it
will
be
spared...
the
courts
will
be
spared
and
the
litigants
will
be
spared
the
burden
of
having
to
sort
out
these
kinds
of
issues
on
a
going-forward
basis
and
recognize
that
we're
not
going
to
pick
up
everything
in
the
interim?
but
as
congress
wants
to
go
forward
and
create
new
causes
of
action,
the
opportunity
will
arise,
and
it
can
do
so.
but
if
it
chooses
to
engraft
it
on
an
existing
infrastructure,
then
it
seems
to
me
under
those
circumstances,
what
the
court
should
do
is
say
these
cause
of
action
arises
at
this
point
in
time.
it
doesn't
arise
because
of
the
new
statute.
it's
a
much
simpler,
much
cleaner
way
of
dealing
with
the
issue.
and...
and
that's
the
one
point
i
did
want
to
make.
i
don't...
i
have
not
heard
the
other
side
remotely
complain
that
our
approach
has
any
of
the
kinds
of
complications.
i'm
not
saying
it's
without
issues,
but
it's
nowhere
near
the
complications...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but
congress
clearly
recognized
that
it
was
not
prepared
to
eliminate
that
regime
because...
because
it
would...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
would
have
created
all
kinds
of
problems
on
a
retroactive
basis.
it
didn't
want
to...
it
didn't
want
to
unsettle
expectations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
you
bring
one
form
of...
of
complication
and
one
form
of...
of
clarity
to
it.
but
at
least
the...
it's
the
clarity
you
know
rather
than
the
clarity
you
don't
know...
or
the
confusion
that
you
don't
know
at
this
point.
courts
have
been
dealing
with
the
question
of
how
to
borrow
for
a
long
time.
the
question
of
how
you're
going
to
deal
with
section
1658
and
what
conflicts
in
the
circuits
you're
going
to
have
to
resolve
and
what
happens
when
congress
makes
minor
modifications...
congress
makes
lots
of
minor
modifications
in
every...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
breyer,
because...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
will...
whatever
the
new,
new,
new
statute
is,
that
will
subject
to
the...
to
the
statute
of...
the
4-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there's
no
retroactivity
issue
you
need
to
worry
about
in
that...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but
if...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
you
are
wrong
about
that.
i
think
all...
if
congress
has
created
a
new
statute,
it...
it
has
told
you
that
this
is
one
that's
subject
to...
to
the
4-year
statute
of
limitations
period
on
a
going-forward
basis,
and
i
think
it's
eliminated
any
of
the
confusion.
and
certainly
congress
knows...
would
know
how
to
do
that
if
the
court
were
very
clear
in
saying
what
we're
going
to
apply
1658
to
is
to
new
causes
of
action
that
are
specifically
stated
with
an
entire
infrastructure
created
to
provide
for
them.
i
don't
think
they
have
to
do
it
in
a
new
title
79
or
whatever,
but
they
clearly
have
to
do
it
by
doing
more
than
simply
changing
the
definition
of
a
single
set
of
