do
you
want
us
to
interpret
this
section
(b)
as
a
new
cause
of
action,
in
other
words?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
section
(b).
you...
you
want
us
to
interpret
section
(b)
as
a
new
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
you
completely
untie
section
(b)
from
section
(a),
number
one,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
and
number
two,
the...
the
implied
cause
of
action
that
we
have
found
might
disappear
because
we
have
told
congress,
when
you
enact
a
new
cause
of
action...
or
a
new
statute,
you
have
to
say
explicitly
if
it
creates
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where...
does
it
say
that
in
1981?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
i
read
it
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
doesn't
sound
like
an
explicit
creation
of
a
cause
of
action
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
what...
but
that
was
under
1981.
you're
saying
it's
a
new
cause
of
action,
and
i'm
saying
that
if
it's
a
new
cause
of
action,
then
congress
has
to
be
explicit
that
there's
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
did
so
in
the
truth
in
lending
act
and...
and
the
clean
air
act
and
the
clean
water
act.
those
are
all
new
enactments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
this
case,
what
about
the
problem
with
the
implied
cause
of
action?
i
don't
read
section
(c)
as
explicitly
granting
a...
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
will
there
be
some
retroactivity
problems
if
some
states
have
6-year
statute
of
limitations
and
this
reduces
that
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
suppose
any
suggestion
that
we
would
be
creating
a...
a
problem
for
congress
in
giving
it...
in
posing
a
dilemma
for
it
is
that
they
can
provide,
number
one,
a
new
statute
and
have
the
statute
of
limitations
set
forth
specifically.
