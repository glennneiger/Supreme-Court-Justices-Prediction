ms.
gorman,
one
of
the
anomalies
that
if...
if
you
are
complaining
about
a
refusal
to
hire,
a
discriminatory
refusal
to
hire,
the
limitation
would
be
2
years,
but
if
you're
complaining
about
a
discriminatory
firing,
it
would
be
4
years.
does
that
make
sense
to...
to
have
those
two
claims
both
stemming
from
the
original
1981,
but
one
having
extended
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
can
see
some
rhyme
or
reason
to
those
differences.
here
it
seems
that...
that
one
claim
is...
is
no
more
deserving
of
a
longer
time
than
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
with
the
hypothetical
that
was
raised
in...
in
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
that
suppose
congress
shrinks
the
people
who
are
exempt
from
title
vii,
say,
and
makes
it
15
or
more
employees
instead
of
25
or
more
employees?
then
what
do
you
do
with
the
people
who
are
newly
included?
do
they
get
a
longer
statute
than
the
ones
who
were
there
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
in...
in
determining
what
congress
meant,
is
it...
wouldn't
it
be
relevant
that
that
seems
something
no
legislature
would
want
to
have
happen,
that
people
who
are
newly
covered
by
the
same
prescription
get
more
time
to
sue
than
people
who
have
always
been
covered?
justice
ginsburg
i
know.
justice
ginsburg
i
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
had
to
pick
one
that
comes
under
1981
or
1982.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
another
problem
that
was
raised
in
the
brief
on
the
other
side
was
what
would
you
do
with
a
circuit
that
had
a
law...
that
it
had
interpreted
the
law
as
allowing
no
claim
and
there's
a
circuit
where
other
circuits
have...
have
allowed
a
claim
in
the...
and
we
haven't
spoken.
in
the
circuit
that
said
there
was
no
claim
and
then...
so
that
people
are
newly
covered...
suppose
congress
eliminates
that
circuit
split
and
it
makes
it
clear
that
everybody
is
covered.
then
what
happens
in
the
circuit
where
people
were
not
covered
until
congress
clarified
the
law?
do
they
get
the
4
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
thing
that
isn't
simpler
about
it,
mr.
phillips,
is
the
problem
that
congress
sought
to
cure
with
1658,
that
is,
you
can
have
amazing
diversity
across
the
country
if
you're
borrowing
states'
limits.
for
the
same
claim,
it
could
be
2
years
in
one
state,
3
years
in
another,
6
in
another.
congress
surely
wanted
to
cut
out
that
disparity
so
that
similarly
situated
people
would
have
the
same
right
to
sue.
justice
ginsburg
and
that's
suggesting
that...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
old
way
is
inherently
complex
because
you
have
to
figure
out
which
would
be
the
closest
state
limitation.
and
congress
just
wanted
to
get
away
from
that
complexity.
i
don't
know
that
that's...
that
that
what
was
introduced
is...
is
more
complex.
it
seems
to
me
less
so.
justice
ginsburg
all
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
newsom,
the
reason
that
congress
grandfathered
the
claims
that
already
existed,
as
mr.
phillips
said,
was
because
of
expectations
that
i'm
off
the
hook
after
2
years,
say.
that...
that
doesn't
exist
when
a
right
is
created,
a
right
to
relief,
that
didn't
exist
before.
