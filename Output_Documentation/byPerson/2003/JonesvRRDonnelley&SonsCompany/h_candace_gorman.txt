ms.
h.
candace
gorman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
answered
the
call
of
the
judiciary
by
enacting
section
1658,
a
bright
line
rule
that
provides
a
default
statute
of
limitations
of
4
years
for
any
civil
action
arising
under
an
act
of
congress
after
december
1st,
1990.
section
1658
applies
to
plaintiff's
claims
because
this
court
said
in
patterson
that
plaintiff
did
not
have
claims
of
racial
harassment
and...
and
termination
and
discharge
claims.
plaintiff's
claims
arise
under
the
1991
civil
rights
act
because
that
is
the
act
that
created
the
cause
of
action
that
plaintiff
has
filed
under.
in
rivers,
this
court
held
that
the
1991
act,
as
amended
by
the
1991
civil
rights
act,
was
a
new
cause
of
action
that
created
new
liabilities
and
a
new
standard
of
conduct.
therefore,
under
section
1658,
under
the
plain
meaning
of
that
statute,
the
1991
civil
rights
act
applies.
the
simple
one-sentence
statute
has
been
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
it
no
meaning.
the
terms,
arising
under,
and
the
term,
civil
action,
are
simple
terms
used
by
this
court
repeatedly
to
describe
the
statute's
reach
and
that
reach
includes
all
civil
actions
arising
under
an
act
of
congress
after
december
1st,
1990,
whether
it
has
roots
in
or
references
preexisting
law.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
yes.
i...
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
purpose
of
section
1658
is
to
cut
down
on
borrowing
and
state
limitations
periods
that
have
been
used
for
the
borrowing
purposes,
and
anything
that
cuts
down
on
those
purposes
of
borrowing
is
going
to
be
going
to
the
effect
of
that
statute.
now,
the
fact
that
there
are
two
statutes
of
limitations
is
not
unusual
in...
in
the
discrimination
cases
that
i
file.
there
are
often
many
statutes
of
limitations
that
someone
has
to
look
at.
for
example,
in
the
age
discrimination
act,
there
are
two
statutes
of
limitations
for
willful
and
not
willful.
often
claims
are
filed
under
section...
under
title
vii,
as
well
as
under
section
1981,
and
we
have
various
statutes
of
limitations
that
we
deal
with
in
those
claims
as
well.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
well,
we
have
to
look
at
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
and
it
is
a
default
statute
of
limitations,
so
congress
has
the
option
at
any
time
of
creating
a...
a
statute
of
limitations
going
back
to
1981
if
it
thinks
that
this
is
not
the
way
it
wanted
it
to
work
out.
but
it...
the
statute
is
clear
that
it's
for
all
new
causes
of
action
or
for
all
causes
of
action
that
arise
under
acts
of
congress
after
december
1st,
1990,
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
plaintiffs'
claims
did
not
arise
until
the
1991
civil
rights
act.
plaintiffs
could
not
file
a
cause
of
action
until
that
1991
civil
rights
act.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
the
1991
act.
the
claims...
i'm
only
addressing
the
narrow
issue...
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
of
the
claims
that
plaintiff
could
not
file
prior
to...
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
correct.
and
i
believe
that
follows
from
the
court's
decisions
both
in
patterson
and
in
rivers.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i
believe
congress
addressed
that
in
the
1991
civil
rights
act,
codifying
that
this
was
a...
that
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
involved.
but
this
court
had
already...
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
in
1981(c).
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
the
rights
protected
by
this
section
are
protected
against
impairment
by
nongovernment
discrimination
and
impairment
under
color
of
law.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
well,
your
honor,
this
court
had
also
said
in
patterson
that
1981
did
create
a
private
right
of
action.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i
believe
the
language
in
section
(c)
was
put
in
there
just
to
confirm
that
what
the
court
said
in
patterson,
that
this
was
a
private
right
of
action,
was
going
forward
with
the
new
statute.
and
to
the
point
that
this
is
definitional,
which
i
think
was
what
you
were
also
raising,
justice
kennedy,
the
fact
that
congress
adds
definitions
to
create
causes
of
action
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
rivers
as
a
way
that
congress
often
creates
causes
of
action.
so
i
believe
that
that's
very
consistent
with
how
this...
how
congress
enacts
causes
of
action.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i
believe
it
rests
on
the
proposition
that
the
most
common
way
of
meaning...
using
arising
under
is
the
way
justice
holmes
described
it
and
that's
that
a
suit
arises
under
the
law
that
creates
the
cause
of
action.
and
that's
what
we're
saying
here,
that
this
suit
relies
on
the
1991
law.
that's
what
created
plaintiff's
cause
of
action.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i
don't
believe
that's
how
the
statute
was...
was
drafted,
your
honor.
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
place
any
limitation
on
congress'
ability
to
establish
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
for
a
federal
claim,
and
i
believe
section
1658
is
clearly
directed
to
federal
causes
of
action,
federal
civil
actions,
not
to
state
civil
actions.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
your
honor,
i
believe
arising
under
in
this
sense
should
be
used
in
the
way
that
it's
most
used
by
this
court
and
in
the
way
that
it's
used
in
title
28,
which
is
where
this
statute
was...
is
codified.
as
justice
frankfurter
said,
you...
you
take
the
soil
along
with
it,
that
goes
along
the
other
statutes.
so
the
fact
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
and
consistently
said
in
title
28
that
a
cause
of
action
arises
under
the
law
that
creates
the
cause
of
action
or
if
it
depends...
depends
on
that
cause
of
action.
i
believe
that's
the...
the
way
arising
under
should
be
used
in
this
case
as
well.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
but
i
believe
this
is
the
more
consistent
approach
with
how
this
court
has
looked
at
arising
under
in
the...
in
the
jurisdictional
context
because
that
is
where
this
court...
that
is
where
congress
has
placed
this
definition
in
the
statute.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
your
honor,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the...
the
reasoning
of
this
court
has
been
consistently
that
under
title
28,
arising
under
has
been
used
as
justice
holmes
has
suggested
it,
and
that's
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the...
is
the
bright
line
rule
that
this
court
should
follow
in
this
case.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i
understand,
your
honor.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
they
do.
and
again,
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
default
statute
of
limitations,
so
congress
would
always
have
the
ability
to
affix
a
statute
of
limitations.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
your
honor,
first
that
example
comes
from
title
vii
which
does
have
its
own...
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i
still
think
we
have
to
give
the
plain
meaning
of
the...
of
the
statute
its
effect,
and
congress...
we
have
to
understand
that
congress
set
this
as
a
default
and
if
congress
does
not
want
to
have
this
anomaly
where
people
who
are
between
15
and
25
employees
in
a...
in
an
employment
relationship
where
it's
under
25
employees
and
now
a
cause
of
action
has
been
created
for
them...
if
congress
does
not
want
to
have
that
situation,
then
congress
is
going
to
have
to
draft
a
statute
of
limitations
which
that...
with
that
law,
which
congress
has
shown
under
the
sarbanes-oxley
act
that
it
is
more
than
willing
and
able
to
do.
when
congress
adopted...
when
congress
amended
the
telecommunications
act
of
1936
to
add
the
sarbanes-oxley
amendment,
it
put
in
the
statute
of
limitations
that
it
knew
it
wanted
to
have
so
it
would
be
consistent
with
other
statute
of
limitations
within
that
statute.
and
it
is
clear
from
the
reading
of
that
statute,
that
if
congress...
that
congress
thought
if
they
had
not
put
in
that
amendment,
that
the
4-year
statute
of...
of
limitations
would
apply
even
though
that
was
an
amendment
to
a
preexisting
statute.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i
believe
in
most
cases
i
think
everyone
will
get
4
years,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
section
1658
does
not
address
the
circuit...
circuit
split.
it
addresses
the
statute
that's
enacted
by
congress.
so
if
congress
enacts
the
statute
setting
forth
a
cause
of
action
that
was
not
codified
before,
then
i
believe
that
that
4-year
statute
of
limitations
would
apply.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i...
i
think
one
thing
that
we
would
always
be
able
to
do
is
to
look
at
these
statutes.
since
we're
looking
at
this
in
the
abstract,
it's
hard
to
say.
but...
but
taking
the...
the
1991
statute,
for
example,
where
congress
defines
it
in
the
purpose
as
expanding
the
rights,
then
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
is
something
new
that
did
not
exist
before.
so
i
think...
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i'm
sorry.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
no.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
that
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
new
cause
of
action
but
it
would
now
be
arising
under
an
act
of
congress
that
was
enacted
after
1990,
and
i
think...
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
i
understand,
your
honor,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
if
we
use
patterson
as
an
example,
in
patterson
the
court
said
there
was
no
claim
under
1981
for
post-contract
claims.
and
then
when
congress
enacted
the
1991
act,
if...
if...
i'm
sorry.
patterson
had
not
been
decided
by
this
court,
but
we
had
circuits
in
a
disarray
on
this
issue
and
then
congress
enacted
the
1991
act
and
said
in
there
we
are
expanding...
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
and
defining.
then
i
believe
that
the
4-year
statute
would
apply.
and
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
thank
you.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
stevens,
if
i
can
answer
your
last
question.
yes,
there
was
another
statute
that
i
can
think
of
and
that's
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
although
this
is
before
1990.
so
the
1658
question
doesn't
come
into
play.
but
title
vii
was
amended
just
to
add
that
cause
of
action
for
pregnancy
discrimination...
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
correct,
your
honor,
by
redefining
discrimination
based
on
sex
to
also
include
discrimination
in
pregnancy.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
correct.
your
honor,
defendant
raised
two
statutes
that
they...
that
they
could
now
point
to
that
they
said
would
benefit
from
section
1658.
they
pointed
to
the
muhammad
ali
boxing
act
and
the
anti-discrimination
law.
and
i
submit
to
this
court,
as
justice
breyer
said,
those
aren't
going
to
be
new
acts
either
because
if
you
look
at
those
acts,
they're
actually
amending
previous
acts,
and
they
pull
definitional
terms
out
of
previous
acts
from
before
1990.
if
defendant's
interpretation
is
accepted
by
this
court,
then
we
are
basically
saying
section
1658
is
a
nullity
because
we
have
scoured
the
statutes
enacted
by
congress
after
december
1st,
1990
and
we
could
not
find
one
statute
that
would
benefit
from
section
1658,
because
congress
often
takes
terms
or
definitions
or
causes
of
action
from
previous
statutes
and
amends,
even
when
it
thinks
it's
creating
or
it
looks
like
it's
creating
something
brand
new.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
correct,
your
honor,
where
they
take...
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
terms
out
of
the
new...
out
of
old
legislation.
ms.
h.
candace
gorman
well,
your
honor,
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
think
what
respondent
must
be
suggesting
then
is
that
section
1658
would
only
come
into
play
if
the
new
statute
was
the
only
statute
you
were
relying
on.
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
section
1658
is
stating.
i
think
if...
even
if
this
court
says,
we're
relying
on
old
section
1981,
as
well
as
1981
as
amended
by
the
civil
rights...
civil
rights
act,
clearly
our
claim
is
still
dependent
on
the
1991
act
and
therefore
section
1658
would
still
come
into
play.
and
as
far
as
confusion,
defendant
suggested
that
there
was
even
confusion
in
this
case
because
the
judge
in
our
case
did
not
know
if
class
2
claims
were
covered
by
this
section
1658.
there
is
no
confusion
with
the
court.
it
just
wasn't
briefed
before
the
court.
there
was
no
record
before
the
court
because
we
had
asked
for
a
slightly
different
definition
in
our
class
certification,
and
the
judge
went
beyond
that
definition
and
established
a
different
class
for
the
class
2.
so
the
judge
just
didn't
have
the
record
and
he
thought
we
could
figure
that,
which
i
think
we
probably
could.
and
i
think
the
answer
is
going
to
be
that
the
class
2
claims
also
fall
under
the
1658
statute.
the
question
before
this
court
is
a
narrow
one:
does
section
1658
apply
to
plaintiffs'
cause
of
action
for
racial
discrimination
and
termination
those
claims
were
not
created
until
the
1991
civil
rights
act,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
section
1658
should
apply
to
those
claims.
thank
you.
