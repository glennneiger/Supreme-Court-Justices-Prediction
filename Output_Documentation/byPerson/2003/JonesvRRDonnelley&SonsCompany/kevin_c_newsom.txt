mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
perhaps
the
most
frequent
litigants
in
suits
alleging
violations
of
federal
law,
the
states
and
their
officers
have
an
overriding
interest
in
this
case
in
ensuring
that
section
1658
is
construed
to
establish
a
clear
and
easily
discernible
rule.
that
in
my
mind
leaves
two
options.
there
are
effectively
two
clear
options
on
the
table.
one
is
to
apply
section
1658
to
all
section
1981
claims
and
the
other
is
to...
is
to
continue
the
practice
of
applying
state
borrowed
statutes
of
limitations
to
all
of
those
claims.
both
of
those
rules
create
the
same
level
of
certainty,
but
one
of
those
rules,
namely
the...
the
rule
that
would
apply
section
1658
to
all
section
1981
claims,
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
congress'
intent
and
indeed
with
the
language
of
section
1658
itself
in
that
it
would
apply
to
claims
that
on
any
understanding
arose
under
preexisting
law.
accordingly,
the
state
submits
that
the
respondent's
position
here
is
the
best
among
the
available
alternatives.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
i
think
the...
the
expectations
that
congress
sought
to
protect
in...
in
section
1658
were
expectations
with
respect
to
certain
categories
of
claims.
in
enacting
section
1658
congress
recognized
that
there
were
certain
categories
of
claims
that
had
developed
established
limitations
rules.
for
instance,
under
this
court's
then-recent
decisions
in
wilson
v.
garcia
and
goodman
v.
luken
steel,
section
1983
claims
as
a...
as
a
category
and
section
1981
claims
as
a
category
were
both
subject
to
single
borrowed
state
statutes
of
limitations.
so
i
think
the
expectation
that
congress
sought
to
protect
was
the
expectation
of
a
litigant
that
i
have
a
1981
claim
and
it
will
be
subject
to
the
following
statute
of
limitations.
so
i
think
the...
that...
i
mean,
it
sounds
to
me
that
there
is
agreement
this
morning
that...
that
the
appropriate
test
to
apply
is
the
test
whether
or
not
congress
has
created
a
new
cause
of
action.
i
think
the
clearest
evidence
that
congress
has
done
that,
that
congress
has
created
a
new
cause
of
action,
is
where
congress
creates
and
enacts
an
entirely
new,
separate
statutory
section.
and
again,
contrary
to
petitioners'
suggestions...
and
justice
kennedy
is
quite
right...
there
are
numerous
times
that
congress
has,
since
december
1
of
1990,
created
an
entirely
new
and
freestanding
causes
of
action
to
which
section
1658
would
certainly
apply.
now,
congress'
choice
in
the
1991
civil
rights
act
not
to
create
a
new
statutory
section
and
instead
to...
to
work
within
the
four
corners
of
section
1981
and
to...
to
fine
tune
the
existing
cause
of
action
that
already
existed
in
section
1981
is
a
strong
indication...
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
i
think
the...
the
key
consideration
here
is
that
congress
had
a
choice
in
the
1991
act
how
it
would
respond
to
this
court's
decision
in
patterson.
it
was
acting
against
a
very
specific
backdrop.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
i
agree
with
mr.
phillips,
and
having...
having
just
said
that
the
strongest
indication
of
congress'
intent
to
create
a
new
cause
of
action
would
be
its
creation
of
an
entirely
new
statutory
scheme,
i
do
agree
that
as...
as
congress
moves
away
from
that
paradigm,
that
it
may,
for
instance,
in
a
freestanding
section
1981(d),
if
it
enacts
all
of
the
elements
of
a
new...
of
a
new
claim,
that
yes,
indeed,
that
would
create
a
new
cause
of
action
within...
within
the
meaning
of
section
1658.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
exactly
right.
the
problem
with
class
2...
and
tell
me
if
i'm
misunderstanding.
the
problem
with
class
2
is
that
class
2
rises
or
falls
on
a
given
set
of...
on
a
given
set
of
facts.
the
district
court
did
not
conclude
whether
this
class
of...
this
class
of
plaintiffs'
promotion
and
assignment
claims
would
succeed
on
a
specific
set
of
facts.
the
problem...
and
that
we
think
is
the...
the
problem
inherent
in
petitioners'
position
that
ties
the
question
of
whether
a
new
cause
of
action
has
been
created
to
the
viability
of
a
given
claim
rather
than
looking,
as
section...
as
section
1658
directs
the
court
to
do,
what...
to...
to
whether
or
not
a
civil
action
is
created.
a
civil
action
in
my
mind
speaks
to
your
ticket
into
court,
not
so
much
with
respect
to
what
happens
to
you
once
you
get
there.
so...
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
that's
certainly
true.
any...
i...
i
certainly
agree
that
any
rule
this
court
adopts
could
be
superseded
by
a
subsequent
amendment
of...
of
an
enactment
by
congress.
but
in
the
meantime,
this
court
we
think
ought
to
adopt
a
rule
that
minimizes
confusion
and...
and
maximizes
certainty.
that,
in
essence,
is...
is
the...
is
the...
the
proposition
coming
out
of
this
court's
decision
in
wilson
v.
garcia,
as
mr.
phillips
said,
which
is
that
in
that
case,
justice
o'connor,
for
instance,
made
a
very
good
point
in
her
dissent
that...
in
that
1983
claims
run
the
gamut
from
police
brutality
claims
on
the
one
hand
to...
to
school
desegregation
cases
on
the
other
and
thought
that
it
just
didn't
make
sense
to
apply
a
single
statute
of
limitations
to
such
a
wide
variety
of
claims.
and
this
court
held...
and
i
submit
correctly...
that
the
practical
considerations,
those
of
maximizing
certainty
and
minimizing
litigation,
required
the
enactment...
or
the...
the
imposition
of
a
single
categorical,
some
would
surely
say
formalistic,
statute
of
limitations.
and
the
same
practical
considerations
obtained
here
at
least...
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
that's
certainly
right.
and
the
state's
principal
interest
here
is
in...
is
in
a...
a
clear
statute
of
limitations,
not
necessarily
the
shortest
statute
of
limitations.
our
interest
here
is...
is
principally
in
clarity.
so
again,
if
i
can
just
emphasize,
congress...
congress
acted
in
section...
or
rather
in
the
1991
act
against
a
very
specific
backdrop,
namely
this
court's
then-recent
decision
in
goodman
v.
luken
steel,
which
held
that
a...
that
a
single
borrowed
state
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
to
all
section
1981
claims.
now,
if
congress
wanted
to
walk
away
from
goodman
and
create
a
new
cause
of
action
so
as
to
trigger
section
1658's
4-year
statute,
then
our
submission
is
then
it
had
to
be
clear
about
what
it
was
doing.
it
had
to...
in
the
paradigmatic
example,
it
had
to
create
a
new
standalone
section.
at
the
very
least,
it
had
to
create
a...
a
self-contained
and
freestanding
civil
action
within
the
confines
of
section
1681.
but
where
it
merely
defined
the
term
in
a
preexisting
cause
of
action,
we
submit
that
that
is
simply
not
clear
enough
to...
to
apply
the...
the
4-year
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
there
may
well
be
justice
stevens,
not
that
i'm
aware
of
off
the
top
of
my
head.
