mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners'
claims
for
racial
discrimination
in
the
terms
and
condition
of
employment
are
subject
to
the
uniform
statute
of
limitations
set
forth
in
28
u.s.c.
1658
because
those
claims
were
created
by
and
therefore
arise
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991,
an
act
of
congress
enacted
after
december
1...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
o'connor,
i
think
some
of
the...
the
issues
that
have
been
identified
to
the
court
are
a
direct
product
of
the
compromise
that
congress
struck
in
1990.
originally
the
act,
as
proposed
by
the
federal
courts
study
committee,
would
have
applied
a
uniform
statute
of
limitations
to
all
existing
causes
of
action.
and
some
members
of
congress
and
groups
believed
that
that
would
create
retroactivity
concerns.
so
the...
the
compromise
that
was
adopted
was
that
the
uniform
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
on
a
going-forward
basis
with
respect
to
causes
of
actions
that
were
created
by
acts
of
congress
enacted
after
december
1990.
this
case
involves
precisely
such
a
cause
of
action.
petitioners'
claims
we
know
from
the
patterson
case
were
not
actionable
under
statute
1981
prior
to
the
1991
civil
rights
act.
the
only
reason
petitioners
are
in
court
today
and
have
viable
claims
is
because
of
the
1991
civil
rights
act.
therefore,
we
think
that
respondent's
position
which
results
in
the
conclusion
that
petitioners'
claims
arise
under
the...
the
same
statute
at
issue
in
patterson,
the
statute
that
we
know
does
not
create
those
claims,
is
an
absurd
conclusion
that
we
think
counsels
against
their
position.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
scalia,
we
think
that
the
circuit
split
problem
would
be
resolved
for
purposes
of
section
1658
the
same
way
it
would
be
resolved
for
retroactivity
purposes.
anytime
congress
creates
a
new
cause
of
actions,
there...
there
are
going
to
be
questions
that
arise
from
the
creation
of
that
cause
of
action.
the
court
considered
the
same
question
in
hughes
aircraft
v.
united
states
ex
rel.
schumer
where
congress
amended
the
false
claims
act
to
eliminate
a
jurisdictional
defense,
and
this
court
said,
on
pages
949
and
950
of
its
opinion,
created
a
new
cause
of
action.
and
therefore,
the
court
held
that
cause
of
action
cannot
be
retroactively
applied.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
justice
scalia.
in
the
sense
that
the
same
issue
would...
would
arise
for
retroactivity
purpose,
whether
or
not
congress
has
created
a
new
cause
of
action
which
would
apply
retroactivity...
retroactively
or
not.
and
even
if
the
retroactivity
question
didn't
arise,
that's
a
product
of
the
statute
that
congress
has
drawn.
another...
another
problem
with
respondent's
construction...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
as
we
interpret
it,
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
plain
meaning
of
congress'
use
of
both
the...
the
all-inclusive
term,
the
traditionally
inclusive
term,
arising
under,
as
well
as
congress'
reference
to
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
don't
think
it
applies
to
state
causes
of
action
at
all.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
that's
not
a
product
that
congress
has
used
of
arising
under.
it's
a
question
of
whether
congress
intended
to
supply
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
for
state
claims.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
in
the
first
place,
we
think
that
plaintiffs'
claims
arise
under
the
1991
civil
rights
act
under
any
definition
of
arising
under,
dictionary
definition,
the
statutory
definition,
and
28
u.s.c.
1331...
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
question
would
be
the
same
question
that
this
court
considered
in
the
rivers
case
which
was
whether
or
not
congress
created
new
causes
of
action
in
the
1991
civil
rights
act,
and
the
court
analyzed
that
question
by
looking
to
congress'
intent
enacting
that
act.
some
parties
argued
that
congress
had
simply
clarified
and
continued
into
effect
old
rights.
other
parties
argued
that
congress
had
created
new
rights,
and
this
court
agreed
with
that
interpretation.
and
we
think
that
that
interpretation
requires
the
conclusion
in
this
case
that
petitioners'
claims
are
governed
by
the
statute
of
limitations
in
section
1658.
if
i
could
refer
to
another
problem
with
respondent's
construction
and
that
is
it...
it
essentially
renders
inoperative
the
default
rule
established
by
congress
in
section
1658
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
and
that's
because
congress
rarely
creates
the
kind
of
wholly
new
and
self-contained
cause
of
action
that
has
no
reference
to
or
roots
in
federal
law.
and
that's
the
only
time
that
the
default
rule,
which
congress
thought
was
a
significant
improvement
to
the
prior
practice
of
state...
borrowing
state
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
under...
under
respondent's...
under
respondent's
interpretation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but...
but,
justice
kennedy,
congress
often
chooses
to...
to
build
upon
existing
federal
law
in
creating
causes
of
action.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think...
from
our
understanding
of
section
(c),
it
was
intended
to
clarify
that
section
1981
does
create
a
private
right
of
action,
which...
which
this
court
had
held
in
runyan
and
reaffirmed
in
patterson.
but
we
don't
think
it's
a
problem
if
the
court
concludes
that
petitioners'
claims
depend
on
both
subsection
(a)
of
1981
and
subsection
(b)
of
1981
because
petitioners'
claims
only
exist
today
because
of
the
1991
act,
in
that
respect,
arise
under
that
act,
under
the
dictionary
definition
of
arising
under
and
under
the
settled
definition
of
arising
under
that
congress
uses
in
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
petitioner
seems
to
read
the
statute's
reference
to
an
act
of
congress
to
refer
only
to
an
act
of
congress
that
creates
the
kind
of
wholly
new
self-contained
cause
of
action
i
mentioned.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
respondent.
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
we
think,
as...
as
judge
alito
concluded
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
zubi
case,
that
an
act
of
congress
is
just
as
naturally
read
and
has
to
be
read
to
include
an
act
of
congress
that
creates
a
cause
of
action
by
amending
an
existing
cause
of
action.
and
all
of
respondent's
objections
about
the
practicality
of
our
position,
which
we
think
is...
is
the
plain-meaning
position
of
what
congress...
the
statute
that
congress
wrote,
have
to
be
weighed
against
the
intractable
problems
that
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
study
committee
identified
with
respect
to
the
past
practice
of
borrowing
state
statutes
of
limitations.
our
inquiry
focuses
the
analysis
exclusively
on
congress'
actions
and
federal
law,
and
we
think
that
that's
where
congress
wanted
the
courts
to
focus.
the
prior
practice
focused
the
inquiry
on
state
law.
it
required
federal
courts
to
canvas
state
law,
to
identify
an
analogous
state
cause
of
action,
and
then
to
try
to
identify
the
statute
of
limitations
that
would
apply
in
the
state
to
that
cause
of
action,
and
then
to
make
a
separate
determination
whether
that
state
statute
of
limitations
could
appropriately
be
applied
to
federal
law.
and
that
had
created
great
uncertainty
and
great
disparity
in
the
application
of
federal
law.
indeed,
under
the
old
practice,
a
single
federal
claim
could
be
subjected
to
50
different
state
statutes
of
limitations.
and
that
was
the
problem
that
congress
was
addressing
at
the...
the
recommendation
of
the
federal
courts
study
committee
in
enacting
section
1658.
and
it
decided,
as
a
result
of
the
compromise,
to
apply
it
only
on
a
going-forward
basis
with
respect
to
new
claims
that
were
created
by
congress
after
1990.
petitioners'
claims
only
exist
today
as
a
result
of
congress'
action
in
the
1991
act,
and
we
think
they're
clearly
governed
by
the
default
statute
of
limitations
established
by
section
1658.
as
petitioners'
counsel
made
clear,
section
1658
is
only
a
default
rule.
congress
can
always
specify
a
different
rule
and
it
has
done
so
several
times
since
1990.
it
did
so
in
the
sarbanes-oxley
act
of...
of
2002,
and
that's
significant
because
that
act,
sarbanes-oxley,
amending
an
existing
cause
of
action
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act...
so
if...
if
congress
had
in
mind
the
interpretation
of
section
1658
that
respondent
proposes,
it's
certainly
odd
that
congress
felt
obliged
to
amend
1658
to
put
in
the
special
statute
of
limitations
for
securities
laws
claims.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it's
2
years
after
the
discovery
of
facts
and
5
years
after
the
violation,
which
is
different
than
the
4-year
rule
established
by
congress
in
section
1658(a).
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
erred
in
subjecting
petitioners'
section
1981
claims,
which
only
exist
because
of
the
1991
civil
rights
act,
to
the
old
borrowing
practice
that
congress
sought
to
put
an
end
to
in
1990,
and
we
think
that
this
court
should
hold
that
those
claims
are
governed
by
the
uniform
statute
of
limitations
established
by
section
1658.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
as...
as
judge
alito
explained
in
his...
may
i
answer
that
question?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
as
judge
alito
explained
in
the
zubi
dissent,
there's
no
retroactivity
problems
because
the
only
expectation
that
a
plaintiff
could
have
after
congress
created
the
new
causes
of
action
in
1991
is
if
those
causes
of
actions
would
be
subject
to
the
default
statute
of
limitations
specified.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you.
