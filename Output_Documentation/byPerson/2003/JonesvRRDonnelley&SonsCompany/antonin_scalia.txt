justice
antonin
scalia
your...
your
argument
really
rests
on
the
proposition
that
arising
under
has
a...
a
uniform
meaning,
that
it
doesn't
acquire
different
meanings
in
different
contexts,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we've...
we've
also
held
that...
that
arising
under
embraces
not
just
a...
a
federal
cause
of
action
but
even
state
causes
of
action
that
require
determination
of
a
federal
question
for
which
the
federal
question
is...
is
sort
of
essential.
now,
how
could
you
possibly
apply
that
meaning
to
this
statute?
it
would
mean
that
the
federal
government
would
be
establishing
statutes
of
limitation
for
state
causes
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
you
use
arising
under
the
way
we
use
it
in
other
contexts
where...
where
it...
a
claim
can...
can
be
thought
to
arise
under,
for
purposes
of...
of
federal
court
jurisdiction,
even
though
the
cause
of
action
is...
is
a
state
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
so
you're
picking
one
of
various...
various
meanings,
but
that's
all
that
the
other
side
is
doing
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
in
cases
such
as
smith
v.
kansas
city
title
&
trust
company,
we've...
we've
said
that
arising
under
jurisdiction
includes
where
the
cause
of
action
is
based
on
state
law,
but
relief
necessarily
depends
on
resolution
of
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
we
say
that
federal
courts
can
take
jurisdiction
in
that
situation.
and
as
i
say,
if
you
apply
that
meaning
here,
it...
it
means
that
you're...
you're
setting
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
for
state
causes
of
action
unless
you
want
to
disown
smith
v.
kansas
city
and
that
line
of
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
suggesting
that's
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that...
that's
the
issue,
whether
it
was
codified
before.
some
circuits
say
it
was
already
there.
other
circuits
say
it
wasn't
there.
for
the
latter
circuits,
this
would
be
a
new
creation
of
a
cause
of
action.
for
the
former,
it
would
not.
now,
i
agree
there's
only
one
right
answer;
either...
either
it
existed
under
the
old
law
or
it
didn't
exist
under
the
old
law.
but
frankly,
i
don't
want
to
have
to
sit
here
and
resolve...
resolve
questions
of
whether
something
existed
under
an
old
law
for
no
purpose
except
to
decide
whether...
whether
this
statute
of
limitations
provision
cuts
in
or
not.
i
mean,
it's
a
weird
thing
to
have
us
doing,
deciding
whether
a
statute
was
really
merely
reaffirming
an
old
law
or
whether
it
was
enacting
a
new
cause
of
action.
i...
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
well,
it
has
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
statute
did
create
those
claims?
i
mean,
i'm
getting
back
to
the
circuit
split
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you
don't
give
the
same
answer
that...
that
the
petitioner
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
we...
we
will
have
to
resolve
these...
these
circuit
splits
for
no
purpose
whatever
except
to
decide
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
applies.
right?
we'll
have
to...
justice
antonin
scalia
as
you
interpret
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
is
your
position
as
to
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
state
causes
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you're
not
using
the
all-inclusive
term,
arising
under.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and...
and
you
say
they
didn't
because...
so
your...
since
it's
absurd
to
think
they
did
that,
you're...
you're
giving
arising
under
a
narrower
interpretation
than...
than
we
give
it
for...
justice
antonin
scalia
for
purposes
of...
of
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
that
contradicts
your
other
position
that...
that
we're
going
to
have
to
resolve
this
question
in
order
to
determine
the
circuit
splits
because
if
you
believe
that,
your...
your
answer
would
be
the
same
as...
as
the
petitioners.
you
don't
have
to
resolve
those
circuit
splits
so
long
as
there's
a
later
statute.
it
arises
under
the
state...
under
the
later
statute.
whether
it
arises
under
both,
who
cares?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
solution
to
the
last
problem
you
raised
offered
by
the
petitioner
is
simply
you
use
the
newer
statute,
and
you
don't
have
to
look
into
the
question
of...
of
which
side
of
the
circuit
conflict
was
correct.
if
the
right
is
created
by
the
new
statute,
it
didn't
matter
whether
it...
if
it's
affirmed
by
the
new
statute,
you're
suing
under
the
new
statute,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
existed
before
or
not.
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
solution?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
their
answer
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
the
approach
that
gives
maximum
effect
to
the
new
statutes
of
limitation
that...
that
congress
has
enacted.
now,
what...
what
evidence
is
there
that
congress
wanted
it
to
have
maximum
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much...
how
much
trouble
are
we
going
to
have
in
the
future
if...
if
we
adopted
your...
your
theory?
how...
you
know,
how
am
i
to
decide
in
the
future
whether
a
new
cause
of
action
arises
all
by
itself
or
whether
it...
it
attaches
to
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
to
a
preexisting
statute?
what's...
is
it
an
easy
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
there
may
be
an
equal
protection
problem
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
a
person
says,
you
know,
i...
i
can
sue
within
4
years.
somebody
else
can
only
sue
within
2
because
i
am...
i
am
an
employee
above
25
and...
and
i
only
got
my
cause
of
action
later.
and...
and
the
one
reason
for
the
difference
is
my
statute
was
enacted
later
than
yours.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
know
what
you're
saying
when
you
say
it
takes
it
from
them.
do
you
mean
it
just
copies
them
in
the
new
act?
are
you
counting
situations
in
which
they
recite
it
in
the
new
legislation?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
think...
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
your
opponent
would...
would
count
them.
i...
i
think
only
if...
if
you
rely
upon
the
earlier
statute
for
the
definition,
not
if
you
simply
copy
that
definition
in
the
new
statute,
i
don't
think
he
would
consider
that
to
be
covered.
