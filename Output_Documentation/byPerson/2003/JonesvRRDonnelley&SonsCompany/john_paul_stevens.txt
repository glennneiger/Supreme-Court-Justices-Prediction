justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
about
the
circuit
that
already
recognized
the
cause
of
action?
may
i
repeat
my
question?
say
that...
prior
to
the
statutory
amendment,
the
seventh
circuit
had
already
recognized
the
cause
of
action
that
the
amendment
confirmed.
now,
would
it
be
a
new
cause
of
action
in
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
seventh
circuit
thought
it
arose
under
an
act
of
congress
even
before
the
amendment.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
except
the
fact
they
enacted
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
problems
that
troubles
me
about
borrowing
state
law...
i've
had
a
lot
of
experience
in
these
cases...
that
if
you
look
at
this
statute
under
state
law,
i
think
the
old
cause
of
action
that
patterson
recognized
would
be
a
contract
cause
of
action.
and
arguably,
the
one
before
us
today
is
a
tort
action.
so
you'd
probably
have
to
follow
the
state
tort
law
statute
of
limitations
for
half
the
case
and
the
contract
statute
of
limitations
for
the
other
half
of
the
case,
after
you
figure
out
which
state
law
applies.
so
you
have
this
problem,
even
if
you're
referring
back
to
state
law,
of
maybe
coming
out
with
two
different
results.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
section
1981
as
construed
in
patterson
is
clearly
a
contract
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as...
but
this
cause
of
action
i
don't
think
is
clearly
a
contract
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
would
this
be
a
different
case
if
instead
of
enacting
the
statute
it
did
in
1991,
they...
they
simply
had
an
amendment
that
said
in
addition
to
the
coverage
of
the
preexisting
1981,
we
will
add
the
additional
brand
new
cause
of
action
which
will
allow
recovery
for
what
happens
after
you
get
on
the
job?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
your
answer
seems
to
me
to
suggest
that
if
the
statute
has
the
same
substantive
effect,
you
get
one
result
in
one
form
of...
type
of
drafting
and
a
different
result
with
a
different
type
of
drafting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
has
the...
it
has
the
complications
that...
that
preexisted
in
trying
to
figure
out
which
state
law
applies
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
it
says
that
regime
still
survives
in
a
lot
of
areas
that
it
would
not
survive
if
you
take
their
side.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that...
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
that
to
the
extent
you
are
changing
that
regime,
you're...
you're
bringing
more
certainty
to
the
law
because
that
is
an
inherently
confusing
regime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
say
it's
fine
tuning
an
existing
cause
of
action
if
the
plaintiff
couldn't
have
recovered
before
the
1991
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
with
mr.
phillips
if
they'd
written
a
different
statute
that
came
out
with
exactly
the
same
result,
but
they
just
said...
it
would
not...
not
redefine
words
but
simply
said,
in
addition
to
what
you
can
already
do
you,
you
may
also
recover
for
what
happens
on
the
job?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it
had
done
that,
then
we'd
still
have
the
same
problems
of
deciding
whether
the...
a
particular...
like
class
2
in
this
case,
whether
they
come
under
one
section
rather
than
the
other.
you'd
have
that
problem
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
also
true,
is
it
not,
that
this
is
one
of
those
unique
cases
in
which
the...
the
4-year
rule
will
help
some
plaintiffs
and
help
defendants
in
other
cases
because
some
of
the
state
statutes
for
certain
causes
are
actually
longer
than
4
years?
so
sometimes
it's
cutting
it
down
and
sometimes
it's
expanding
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
other
question,
if
i
may.
are
there
other
statutes
like...
that
have
just
made
a
substantive
amendment
merely
by
redefining
a
term?
i
think
this
is
kind
of
a...
this
is
kind
of
an
unusual
statute
and
it
may
be
a
very
unusual
problem
we've
got.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
they
do
it...
did
that
statute
do
it
just
by
redefining
a
term,
redefining...
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
in
response
to
our
gilbert
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1990,
congress
enacted
a
catchall
four
years
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
all
causes
of
action
arising
under
acts
of
congress
thereafter
enacted.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
limitations
period
applies
to
a
cause
of
action
rising
under
42
u.s.c.
1981,
a
statute
that
was
originally
enacted
after
the
civil
war
but
amended
in
important
respects
in
1991.
the
claim
asserted
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
not
have
stated
a
violation
of
the
1981
as
originally
enacted
but
it
does
state
a
violation
of
the
amended
statute.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
contrary
to
the
views
of
the
court
of
appeals,
we
conclude
that
the
claim
arose
under
the
amended
statute
and
that
the
four
years
statute
limitations
applies.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
