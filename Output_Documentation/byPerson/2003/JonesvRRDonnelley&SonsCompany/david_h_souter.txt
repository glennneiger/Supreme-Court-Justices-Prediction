in...

justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
you
off.
i
was...
in
the
case
of
the
circuit
split,
i
thought
the
statute
that
broke...
that...
that
resolved
the
circuit
split
and
confirmed
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
would...
would
qualify
on
your
theory
of
arising
under
because
your...
your
cause
of
action
would,
in
part,
be
based
upon
the
amending
statute.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
isn't
her
answer
to
the...
to
the
fact
that
it
isn't
self-evident
from
the
language
alone
an
answer
she
gave
to
a
separate
question,
and
that
is
that
it's
the
policy
of
congress
to
apply
the...
the
4-year
rule
when
it
can
so
that
if
in
doubt...
if
the
language
allows
but
doesn't
compel,
then
the
answer
would
be
apply
the
new
statute
because
that
is
going
to
get
to
the
congressional
objective
of
getting
the
4-year
statute
as
broad...
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
the...
isn't
the
support
that
they
started
out
by
intending
to...
to
apply
the
4-year
period,
i
mean,
across
the
board
and
they...
they
only
fell
back
out
of
fear
of...
of
violating
reliance
interests
which
would
say
the...
the
objective
is
still
to
get
the
broadest
possible
application?
justice
souter
they
could...
justice
david
h.
souter
they
could
have
said
that,
but
the...
the
counter-argument
to...
to
what
you've
just
said
is...
and...
and
maybe
this
is...
i
hope
you'll
comment
on
this,
that
on
your
reading,
the
4-year
statute
is...
is
rarely
going
to
be
applied
simply
because
there...
there
aren't
very
many
sort
of
absolutely
brand-new,
freestanding,
self-contained
causes
of
action.
most
of
them
are...
are
subjects
of
tinkering
from
time
to
time.
