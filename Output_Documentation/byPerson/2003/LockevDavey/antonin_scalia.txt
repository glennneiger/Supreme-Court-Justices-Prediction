they
were
all
adopted
at
about
the
same
time,
weren't
these
so-called
blaine
amendments?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
how...
how
do
you
reconcile
that?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
say
it
does
not
violate
the
religion
clauses
to
prohibit
the
use
for
any
religious
instruction
whatever,
you
would
also
have
to
say
that
it
does
not
violate
the
religion
clauses
to
say
no
public
funds
shall
be
spent
for
jewish
theology
studies.
why...
why...
i
mean,
the
state
is
not
permitted
to
discriminate
between
religious
sects,
but
it's
just
as
much
not
permitted
to
discriminate
between
religion
in
general
and
non-religion.
so
how
can
you
possibly...
i
mean,
if
we
say
that...
that
you
can
do
this,
it
seems
to
me,
we
have
to
say
you...
you
can
also
prohibit
jewish
studies.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's...
it's
treating...
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
treating
religion
differently
from
non-religion.
you
can
study
anything
you
like
and
get
it
subsidized
except
religion.
why
is
that
not
violating
the
principle
of
neutrality?
justice
antonin
scalia
can...
can
you
not
study
atheism
under
this
statute?
suppose
there
is
a
course
debunking,
debunking
all
religious
belief.
would
that
be
prohibited?
would
that
be
funded
under
this
statute?
i
don't
see
any...
any
prohibition
of
the
funding
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
statute
say?
i
don't
see
how
it
can
possibly
apply
to
that.
what
does
it
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
theology.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is...
is
a
degree
in
atheism
a
degree
in
theology?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
cases
do
you
cite
for
the
proposition
that
you're
asserting
that
the...
that
the
free
exercise
clause
or
the
establishment
clause
applies
differently
to
discrimination
between
different
religions
than
it
does
to
discrimination
between
religion
in
general
and
non-religion?
what...
what
cases
do
you
cite
for
that
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that
doesn't...
that...
the
issue
there
was
whether
you
were
discriminating
against
religion
or
not.
and
since
you
are
not
prohibiting
study
about
religion,
that
isn't
the
question
here.
the
question
is,
assuming
you
are
discriminating
between
religion
and
non-religion,
you
can't
study
theology
but
you
can
study
anything
else,
what
is
there
in
our
cases
that
says
that
is
okay,
although
it
would
not
be
okay
to
distinguish
between
jewish
studies
or
catholic
studies
or
protestant
studies
and
other
studies?
i
don't
know
a
single
case
that
says
the
principle
of
neutrality
somehow
applies
differently
so
long
as
you're
discriminating
against
all
religion
than
it
does
when
you're
just
discriminating
against
one
denomination.
did
you
have
a
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
mean
that
the
state
can
decline
to
provide
fire
protection
to
churches
and
synagogues?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
washington
doesn't
do
that,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that...
that
general
public
benefit
is
extended
to
both
religious
and
non-religious
institutions
equivalently,
and
people
don't
get
upset
about
that,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
rational...
you...
you
think
there's
a
difference
in
free
exercise
if
what
the
state
says
is,
we
are
burdening
the
free
exercise
of
all
religions,
as
opposed
to,
we
are
burdening
the
free
exercise
of
one
particular
religion.
you
think
there's
a
different...
a
different
standard?
again,
i
would
ask
for
the
case
that...
that
suggests
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sekulow...
well,
how
many
states
do
that,
do
you
know?
you're
knowledgeable
on
these
things.
how
many
states
have
voucher
programs
which...
which
would
allow
students
to
go
to
any
private
school,
you
know,
an
elite
academy,
but
not
allow
them
to
go
to
religious
schools?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it...
if
it...
if
it
isn't
coercion
of...
of
his
religion,
i
suppose
it
would
be
okay
to
limit
this...
this
exclusion
to
jewish
theology
or
to
catholic
theology,
because
the
response
would
be
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
coerce
his
religion
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it...
it
will
fund
religious
instruction.
so
long
as
he
doesn't
major
in
theology,
he
can
take
the
same
courses
and
get...
get
instructed
in
religion,
can't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
you
say
is
just
not
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
everybody
who
takes
a
theology
course
has
to
major
in
theology?
i
don't
think
it's
rare
at
all.
probably
most
of
the
students
at
northwest
college
take
theology
courses.
it's...
it's
a
religious
institution,
and
that's
perfectly
okay,
and
the
state
is
willing
to
fund
that.
