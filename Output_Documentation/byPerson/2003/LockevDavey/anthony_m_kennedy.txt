justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
these
values.
as
i
understand,
this
student
could
have
done
exactly
what
he
in
fact
did
if
only
he
did
not
declare
a
double
major.
he
could
have
taken
all
of
these
religious
perspective
courses,
if
only
he'd
called
his
major
business
administration,
which
in
fact
it
was
because
he
had
the
credits
for
that,
too.
that
would
have
been
permissible.
is
that
correct,
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
suppose
that
he
pursued
a
degree
in
business
administration
and
yet,
ancillary
to
that
or
as
options,
took
all
of
these
other
courses.
could
he
have
had
the
aid
that
he
seeks?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
denying
him
aid
simply
because
he
declares
a
double
major?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
denying
him
funds
simply
because
of
the
way
he
labels
the
major
he
chooses,
if
all
the
other
instructions,
all
the
other
elements
of
the
case
are
the
same?
he
takes
all
the
same
courses,
he
has
all
the
same
commitment
as
a
christian,
and
yet
he's
denied
the
relief
in
one
case
and
given
it...
the
subsidy
in
one
case,
and
given
it
in
the
other.
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
doing
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
the
state's
interest
in...
in
denying
aid
for
programs
that
are
inherently
religious?
what
is
that
interest?
is
it
a
compelling
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we've
decided
in
witters
that
it's
unnecessary
to
do
that
to
conform
to
the
establishment
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
after...
after
that,
then
what
is
the
state's
interest
at
this
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
state's
interest
in
redefining
the
establishment
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
witters
said
there
is
no
endorsement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
can't
use
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
don't
see
what
your
interest
is,
and
once
you
do
define
it,
i
want
you
to
tell
me
if
it's
compelling,
rational
basis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
there
is
a...
a
rational
basis
suffices
for
the
state
to
prohibit
this
student
from
declaring
one
of
his
legitimate
majors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i...
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
if
we
decide
in
your
favor,
we
necessarily
commit
ourselves
to
the
proposition
that
an
elementary
and
secondary
school
voucher
program
must
include
religious
schools
if
it
includes
any
other
private
schools.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
your
case
can
be
resolved
on
a
much
narrower
issue
than
that.
here
we
have
a...
a
college
student
who
is
being
required
to
surrender
his...
his
conscientious
beliefs
by
declaring
a
major
which
otherwise
would
have
been
completely
funded
by
the
school,
and
i...
i
just
don't
see
any
interest
in
doing
that.
it
seems
to
me
a...
a
very
severe
violation
of...
of
religious
conscience.
i
think
that's
quite
different
from
an
overall
neutrality
principle,
which
would
foreclose
this
court
on
the
voucher
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
wouldn't
it
be...
am
i...
am
i
correct
or
incorrect
that
the
state
would
fund
a
student
who
majored
in
literature
at
a
institution
which
was
sectarian
and
had
instructors
who
taught
literature
from
a
religious
perspective
or...
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
don't
know
of
any
case
that
says
that
the
less
significant
the
interest
the
state
has
is
the
more
latitude
it
has
in
discriminating
against
religion.
you
don't
know
of
any
case
that
said
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
do
you
agree,
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
and
accept
your
position,
that
the
court
is
committed
on
the
school
voucher
issue
if,
say,
a
school
voucher
program
excludes
parochial
schools?
justice
kennedy
what
are
the
practical
implications?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we've
held
in
witters
that
there
is
no
problem
with
that...
with
that
kind...
with
that
kind
of
subsidy.
