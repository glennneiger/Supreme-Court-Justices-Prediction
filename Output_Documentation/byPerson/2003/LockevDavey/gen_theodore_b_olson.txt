mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
promise
scholarship
program
practices
the
plainest
form
of
religious
discrimination.
it
disqualifies
the
one
course
of
study
that
is
taught
from
a
religious
perspective.
the
clear
and
unmistakable
message
is
that
religion
and
preparation
for
a
career
in
the
ministry
is
disfavored
and
discouraged.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
yes,
it
is.
but
there
is
the
other
tradition
that
is
as
old
as
the
country
itself,
is
the
free
exercise
component
of
the
religion
clauses,
which
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
mandates
neutrality.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
justice...
well,
justice
stevens,
the
individual
that
was
disqualified
in
tennessee
from
being
a
member
of
a
delegate
to
the
constitutional
convention
because
he
was
a
minister...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
same...
the
court
would
have
come
out
the
same
way,
i
submit,
if
it
said
that
ministers
will
not
have
their
expenses
paid,
but
everybody
else
will.
the
language
of
the
decision
and
the
language
of
sherbert
v.
verner
and
fowler
v.
rhode
island
is
that
to
the
extent
that
a
religion...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
he
can
practice
it,
but
he
practices
it
at
a
price.
studying
of
theology
as
the...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
he
practices
it
without
the
same
subsidy
that
is
made
available
to
every
other
citizen
except
someone
who
wants
to
study
to
be
a
minister.
if
it
was
discrimination
against
a
minister
in...
in
the...
in
the
case
involving
tennessee,
this
is
a
discrimination
against
a
person
who
aspires
to
be
a
minister.
he
is
given
less
of
an
advantage
than
all...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
we
submit
that
the
teachings
of
the
decision
of
this
court...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
what
this
court
has
said,
justice
stevens,
is
that
in...
in
many
respects
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause
are
components
of
the
same
principle
that
is...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
is...
there
may
be
breathing
space,
especially
with
respect
to
the
establishment
clause
area,
where
this
court
will
not
find
entanglement
or
endorsement
under
certain
programs
that
may
not
be
required,
but
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
distinguishing...
that
discriminating
against
catholics
and
discriminating
against
people
who
are
religious
generally
and
even
people
who
are
anti-religious
generally
violates
the
twin
components
of
equality
and
neutrality
that
are...
that
are
mandated
by
the
religion
clauses.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice
breyer.
it
is
not
a
major
step
at
all
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
to
say
that
those
funding
programs
for
medicine,
doctors,
nurses,
cannot
distinguish
and
not
discriminate
against
a
person
who
decides
to
go
to
a
catholic
nurse
or
to
a
catholic
doctor.
if
money
is
made
available
for
individuals
in
the
medicare
program
to
exclude
people
that
want
to
go
to
religious
hospitals
for
their
heart
surgery,
that
would
violate
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
it
would
depend,
i
suppose,
on
how
the
program
was
structured,
what
the
inquiry
involving
a
compelling
government...
strict
scrutiny
would
entail.
there
may
be
a
difference,
for
example,
with
respect
to
funding
that's
associated
with
institutions,
as
opposed
to
individual
conscience.
this
is
the
plainest
form
of
religious
discrimination
because
the
person
who
wants
to
believe
in
god
or
wants
to
have
a
position
of
religious
leadership
is
the
one
that's
singled
out
for
discriminatory
treatment.
the
court
has
said
before
that
distinction,
religious
tests
for
governmental
benefits
violate
the
free
exercise
clause.
this
is
a
religious
test.
if
the
person
wants
to
take
a
program
in
theology,
he's
disqualified.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
i
would
say
that
the...
it
is
not
as
far-reaching
as
the...
the
sense
of
doom
that
your
question
suggested.
[laughter]
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
the
idea
that
this
country
when
it...
when
it
provides
tax
exemptions
or
cash
to
citizens
to
educate
their
children,
cannot
single
out
for
discriminatory
treatment
the
catholic
or
the
religious
person
is
not
a
far-reaching...
well,
it
may
have
been
far-reaching
at
the
time,
and
thank
heavens
that
it
is,
that
this
principle
as
the...
i
think
one
of
the
questions,
i
think
it
was
justice
o'connor's
question,
asked
with
respect
to
the
funding
cases
and
this
court
dealt
specifically
with
that
in
the
maher
v.
roe
case
when
it
said
the
funding
cases
do
not
control
the
significantly
different
context
in
which
a
funding
decision
impinges
upon
the
constitutionally-imposed
government
obligation
of
neutrality
required
by
the
religion
clauses.
so
those
funding
cases
are
completely
distinguishable...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
about...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
for
the
reason
that
the
same
argument
was
rejected
in
the
rosenberger
case,
that
the
notion
of...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
i...
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
is,
that
the
students
in
the
rosenberger
that
were
publishing
those
articles
were
publishing
articles
that
advocated
belief
in
god.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
that
was...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
yeah,
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
this
was
a
free
exercise
violation
as
well
as
a
first
amendment
violation.
the
other
point
that
i
think
is
very,
very
important
with
respect
to
that,
if
the
state
starts
to
distinguishing
between
discussion
of
a
subject
and
proselytizing,
the
entanglement
problem
is
going
to
be
enormous.
the
program
will
have
to
be
looked
at
to
see
how
persuasive
it
is.
we
know
today
that...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
because...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
no,
because
the
line
has
been
drawn
by
individuals,
individuals
making
genuinely
free,
independent
choices
to
make
a
dispensation.
it's
like
the
court's
example
in
those
cases
of
an
individual
receiving
a
check
and
then
deciding
exactly
how
to
spend
it
so
there's
a
great
difference
between
those
kind
of
cases.
this
is
no
different
than
the
example
that
justice
scalia
raised
as
providing
fire
protection
or...
or
providing
tax
deductions.
thank
you.
