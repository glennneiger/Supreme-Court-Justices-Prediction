mr.
jay
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
free
exercise
context,
this
court
has
held
that
the
minimum
requirement
of
neutrality
is
that
a
law
not
discriminate
on
its
face
that's
clearly
what
is
taking
place
here,
and
i'd
like
to
put
in
context
exactly
how
the
implementation
of
the
statutory
program
works.
washington,
when
they
adopted
the
promise
scholarship
program
and
how
it's
applied,
works
this
way.
a
student
applies
for
this
general
grant.
in
this
particular
case,
josh
davey
applied
for
the
grant
when
he
was
aware
of
it
in
the
summer,
was
notified
by
the
state
that
he
was
qualified
and
accepted
in
the
program
in
august.
at
that
point
he
enrolled
at
northwest
college,
which
is
an
accredited
and
eligible
institution.
it
was
not
until...
and
he
declared
his
major,
the
dual
major,
at
that
point
in
business
administration
and
the
pastoral
ministries
degree.
two
months
later,
it
was
two
months
until
he
was
notified
by
the
financial
aid
office
through
a
memorandum
that
the
state
circulated
that
after
reviewing
the
promise
scholarship
program,
the
state
then
decided
that
in
fact
there
would
be
a
prohibition
put
in
place
on
pursuing
a
degree
in
theology
and
that
state
has
interpreted
that
to
mean
pursuing
a
degree
in
theology
from
a
religious
perspective.
the
check,
justice
o'connor,
is
sent
directly
to
the
student.
the
school
is
the...
in
the
sense
the
school
gets
the
check
and
hands
it
to
the
student.
it's
not
written
to
the
school.
the
school
cannot
use
it
for...
to...
a
private
institution
cannot
use
it
at
all
for
any
expenditure.
they
can't
credit,
they
can't
debit
the
account.
the
school
merely
verifies
that
the
student's
enrolled.
the
check
then
goes
to
the
student.
it
can
be
used
for
any...
mr.
jay
sekulow
right.
mr.
jay
sekulow
joshua
davey,
and
the
state
has
acknowledged
this,
of
course,
has
the
free
exercise
right
to
pursue
a
degree
in
theology.
the
question
here
is
the
burden
that's
placed
on
it.
of
course,
two
responses.
with
regard
to
the
actual
burden,
here
a
general
benefit
was
available
to
a
student
and
a
religious
classification
was
utilized
to
deny
the
student
access
to
those
funds.
he
met
the
criteria.
mr.
jay
sekulow
sure.
mr.
jay
sekulow
no,
i
think...
mr.
jay
sekulow
no.
the
state...
mr.
jay
sekulow
for
this
reason.
the
state
can
set
neutral
and
eligible
criteria
for
admission
as
an
eligible
institution.
here
it
was
accreditation.
now,
if
the
religious
school,
the
school
that
was
affiliated
with
the
religious
denomination
met
the
general
neutral
eligibility
requirement,
and
there
was
no
countervailing
establishment
clause
problems,
yes,
then
it
should...
mr.
jay
sekulow
that...
mr.
jay
sekulow
i...
i
would
think
not.
i
think
once
it
would
go
towards
the
private
schools,
as
long
as
the
eligibility...
mr.
jay
sekulow
well,
it
would.
i
think
a
voucher
program
could
be
established
that
has
a
neutral
criteria
and
if
the
private
schools
meet
that
criteria,
including
the
private
religious
schools
and
there
is
no
countervailing
establishment
clause
problem,
i
wouldn't
see
any
reason...
mr.
jay
sekulow
absolutely.
mr.
jay
sekulow
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
sekulow
no.
again,
i
think
if
they
meet
the
accreditation
standard,
if
the
program
were
to...
mr.
jay
sekulow
i
don't
think
they
could
do
that.
no,
i
think
it
would
be...
mr.
jay
sekulow
there
are.
thirty-seven
states
have...
mr.
jay
sekulow
interesting,
justice
o'connor,
and
admittedly,
this
is
a
bit
of
a
moving
target
because
state
policies
change,
but
there
are
approximately
37
states
that
have
this
type
of
amendment.
twenty-five
of
those
states
have
programs
of
aid
that
do
not
have
a
discriminatory
basis
upon
religion.
it's
given
to
any
accredited...
mr.
jay
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
sekulow
well,
i
think
a
program
that
were
to
just
limit
it
to
specific
professions
would
not
necessarily
have
to
go
towards
theology.
for
instance,
in
a
lot
of
states
using
that
example,
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
a
shortage
of
nurses
right
now.
and
if
the
state
were
to
adopt
a
program
to
fund
education
for
nurses
that
included
public
and
private
schools,
they
don't
have
to
bring
theology...
mr.
jay
sekulow
well,
if
it
was
as
you
described
it,
i
would
be
here
arguing
the
same
point
in
this
context.
the
idea
that
you
would
list
all
of
the
professions
and
then
say
we
are
going
to
fund
everything
but
those
students
studying
theology
would
be
again
that
religious
classification,
and
i
would
think
unless
the
state
could
establish
its
compelling
governmental
interest...
mr.
jay
sekulow
well,
i
don't
think...
i
agree,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
go
that
far
here.
mr.
jay
sekulow
if...
mr.
jay
sekulow
well...
well,
certainly
in
the...
in
the
direct
aid
cases
and
in
the
establishment
clause
context,
but
this
is
very
similar
to
the
witters
program,
so
there
is
not
the
countervailing
establishment
clause
issue,
and
that's
what
i
was
going
to
address,
justice
kennedy.
depending
on
how
the
voucher
program
is
established
would
depend
on
whether
the
religious
institutions
would
be
included.
for
instance,
again
i
go
to
the
eligibility
issue.
here,
northwest
college
was
an
accredited
institution...
mr.
jay
sekulow
justice
souter,
in
this
particular...
using
that
example,
here
the
school
is
a
qualified
school.
the
northwest
college,
which
admittedly
has
a
religious
affiliation,
it
isn't...
mr.
jay
sekulow
it's
their
major.
mr.
jay
sekulow
in
this
context,
the
way
the
program
is
implemented
within
that
hypothetical
and
within
the
facts
here,
here
students
can
take
these
very
same
courses
in
religion
that
josh
davey...
mr.
jay
sekulow
if
in
fact
the
programs
were
put
forward
this
way
with
the
accreditation
as
you
suggested,
and
there
is
no
countervailing
establishment
clause
issue
and
the
eligibility
issue
of
the
school
is
met,
yes,
i
wouldn't
see
the...
mr.
jay
sekulow
justification
to
exclude
a
particular
major
here
in
this
particular
case,
a
submajor
from
a
religious
viewpoint.
mr.
jay
sekulow
twenty-five
states
have
voucher-type
programs
that
have
no
restrictions
at
all
as
long
as
it's
an
accredited
institution,
so
that's
the...
usually
the
standard.
they
can
go
to
any
school
that's
accredited.
there
are
some
states,
and
it's
about
a
half-dozen,
as
i
said,
justice
scalia,
it's
a
little
bit
of
a
moving
target
because
policies
change,
that
actually
have
this
prohibition
for
religious
education,
and
even
within
some
of
those
states,
the
programs
are
inconsistent.
they'll
have
different
type
of
financial
aid
programs
here.
in
this
particular
situation,
and
the
way
this
particular
program
is
implemented,
though,
joshua
davey
had
already
made,
justice
stevens,
his
declaration
of
a
major
before
he
was
notified
he
was
disqualified.
the
state
didn't
do
the
formal
notification
until
october,
some
two
months
after
he
rolled...
enrolled.
mr.
jay
sekulow
it...
it
was
a
matter
of
conscience.
there
were
some
students
at
the
school
that
did
change
their
mind.
there
were
two
that
did
not.
joshua
davey
was
one
that...
and
the
counselor,
the
financial
aid
counselor,
did
state
in
the
joint
appendix
that
she
cautioned
them
if
they
are
in
fact
going
to
major
in
a
degree
that
would
be
pursuing
a
theology
to
tell
the
truth,
which
he
clearly
did
here.
so
his
implementation
of
the
decision
was
already
made
in
the
sense
that
the
state
came
back
afterwards
and
said
oh,
by
the
way,
these
group
of
students
don't
qualify
for
this.
mr.
jay
sekulow
well,
the
reason
that
i
want...
let
me
address
the
latter,
if
i
might,
justice
breyer.
the
reason
those
details
matter
because
the
line
drawing
albeit
may
be
crude
on
the
state
of
washington,
here
is
within
the
context
of
the
free
exercise
clause,
because
here
the
school
is
an
eligible
institution,
so
that's
not
even
at
issue.
there
is
no
countervailing
establishment
clause
issue
here.
witters
foreclosed
that.
so
all
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
statute
which
on
its
face
states
that
a
student
who
qualifies
based
on
academic
excellence
and
economic
need
makes
the
decision
for
him
or
herself
where
they're
going
to
go
to
school
and
what
they're
going
to
major
in,
and
they
can
major
in
literally
the
universe
of
courses.
there
is
only
one
exclusion.
it's
not
even,
justice
ginsburg,
a
situation
with
a
number
of
majors.
mr.
jay
sekulow
well,
two
responses.
first,
the...
on
the
issue
of
the
state
and
their
obligation,
to
recast
this
as
a...
the
state
is
being
required
to
fund
joshua
davey's
education,
i
think
is...
is
a
miscast
of
the
issue.
the
state
has
decided
to
employ,
to
develop
a
scholarship
program
that's
very
broad-based
and
in
that
program
they
have
given
the
student
the
ultimate
choice
of
where
they
could
go
to
school
as
long
as
it's
within
washington
state
and
accredited
and
literally
they
can
major
in
any
major
except
for
one,
and
that
is
a
theology
exclusion.
mr.
jay
sekulow
no.
i
think
it
would
raise,
if
it's
accredited
i
think
it
would
raise
the
same
problem.
but
it's
not
to
say
that
the
state
universities
don't
teach
courses
in
theology
and
religion.
on
pages
66
and
74
of
the
joint
appendix,
there's
a
listing
of
the
courses
offered
at
the
university
of
washington,
and
it
covers
a
broad
array
of
religious
courses,
albeit
from...
mr.
jay
sekulow
no.
that...
that
would...
mr.
jay
sekulow
no.
and
hopefully
this
won't
be
that
one.
[laughter]
mr.
jay
sekulow
the
play
in
the
joints
as
it's
referred
to.
mr.
jay
sekulow
i...
i
think
the
play
in
the
joints
gives
the
state
broad
flexibility
in
establishing
the
programs
and...
or
not
establishing
a
program
at
all,
but
to
use
the
play
in
the
joints
to
not
accommodate
religion
but
rather
to
target
religion
as
an
exclusion
i
think
is
a
misuse
in
my
view
of
what
the
court
has
at
this
point...
mr.
jay
sekulow
no,
absolutely
not.
and
let
me...
mr.
jay
sekulow
i
don't
have...
i
only
have
20
minutes,
so
i
cannot
reserve
any
more
time.
that's
okay.
but
i
would
normally
be
happy
to.
[laughter]
mr.
jay
sekulow
sure.
there's...
i
don't
think
there
is
any
affirmative
obligation,
justice
ginsburg,
for
the
state,
even
if
the
establishment
clause...
i'll
give
an
example.
the
center
moriches
school
district
in
lamb's
chapel,
while
this
court
held
that
the
establishment
clause
did
not...
required
them
that
they
open
their
facilities
to
comply
with
the
first
amendment
viewpoint
neutrality
issues,
they're
not...
they
were
not
required
to
open
their
facilities
up.
the
state
of
washington
could
develop
programs
for
specific
majors.
mr.
jay
sekulow
no,
i
think
that...
mr.
jay
sekulow
please.
mr.
jay
sekulow
under
the
latter
hypothetical,
that...
that
would
be
our
position,
that
once
you
have
gone
into
the
private
schools
and
the
school
meets
the
neutral
secular
criteria,
our
view
would
be
at
that
point
the
state
should
be
equal
and
not
target
out
religion
for
an
exclusion,
which
is
precisely
the
viewpoint
neutrality
issue
that
we
think
should
apply
and,
of
course,
within
the
free
exercise
context,
the
minimum
requirement
of
neutrality
is
law
not
discriminate
on
its
face.
this
one
does.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
