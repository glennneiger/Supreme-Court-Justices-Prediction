ms.
narda
pierce
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
preserve
freedom
of
conscience
for
all
its
citizens
in
matters
of
religious
faith
and
belief,
washington's
constitution
limits
the
involvement
of
government.
it
limits
both
the
ability
to
regulate
religious
activities
and
to
fund
religious
activities.
ms.
narda
pierce
mr.
chief
justice,
the
recognition
that
this
court
has
given
to
a
state
constitution,
as
opposed
to
a
statute,
is
that
it
is
adopted
by
all
of
the
voters
of
the
state.
however,
both
the
constitution
and
the
state
laws
are
subject
to
federal
constitutional
provisions.
at
issue
today
is
our...
ms.
narda
pierce
justice
o'connor,
the
promise
scholarship
is
to
be
provided
to
the
student
for
purposes
of
educational
expenses
and
they're
required
to
use
it
for
certain
educational
expenses.
the
purpose
of
the
promise
scholarship
established
by
the
legislature
is
to
strengthen
the
length
between...
the
link
between
k-12
education
and
higher
education,
and
in
a
recognition...
ms.
narda
pierce
it...
it
works
like
a
voucher
program
to
the
extent
that
it's
for
educational
expenses.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
specifics
of
voucher
programs,
but
the
student
is
required
to
use
it
for
those
educational
expenses.
it
is
not,
for
example,
like
a
paycheck,
where
a
person
has
those
funds
as
their
private
funds
and
can
dedicate
those
to
any
uses
that
they
choose.
and
that's
a
key
point
under
the
washington
constitution,
because
article
i,
section
11
says
that
public
funds
shall
not
be
applied
to
religious
worship,
exercise,
or
instruction...
ms.
narda
pierce
it
varies,
justice
o'connor,
according
to
the
particular
provisions.
this
provision
refers
to
not
using
public
funds
for
religious
instruction.
we
also
have
a
provision
that
no
public
funds
shall
be
spent
at
schools
under
sectarian
influence.
i...
i
believe
it's
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
36
states
who
have
some
provisions
relating
to
use
of
public
funds
for
religious
instruction,
but
those
vary.
ms.
narda
pierce
your
honor,
this
is
not
the
blaine
amendment.
the
so-called
blaine
amendment
are
those
that
refer
to
use
of
public
funds
in
schools
under
sectarian
control.
that's
a
different
provision
of
the
washington
constitution.
that's
article
ix,
section
4,
and
that
was
required
by
the
enabling
act
that
provided
for
our
statehood,
but
this
is
a
different
provision.
it's
a
provision
that
was
separate
and
apart,
that
was
debated,
that
was
added
to
washington's
constitution
as
a
separate
provision.
ms.
narda
pierce
no,
your...
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
sorry...
it
was
at
the
same
time
of
adoption,
but
it
was
not
the
provision
that
was
required
by
the...
ms.
narda
pierce
enabling
act.
it
was
not
in
the
original
proposed
constitution
set
before
the
framers.
and
during
the
course
of
that
constitutional
convention,
that's
where
this
language
was
added.
and
i
know,
referring
to
the
blaine
amendments,
there's
been
much
made
in
the
briefs
of
whether
or
not
those
amendments
stemmed
from
anti-catholic
motivation.
there's
certainly
no
evidence
in
washington
that
there
was
any
discussion,
any
evidence
of
anti-catholic
motive.
in
washington,
both
article
i,
section
11
and
article
ix,
section
4,
which
is...
more
directly
stems
from
the
blaine
amendment,
federal
level,
they've
always
been
implemented
in
a
non-discriminatory
manner,
prohibiting
both
the
practice
of
any
religion
of
any
sort
in
our
public
schools,
as
well
as
any
funding
for
private
sectarian
schools.
ms.
narda
pierce
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
it
would.
but
what
the
state
has
done
here
is
prohibited
public
funds
for
religious
instruction
wherever
it
occurs,
including
in
a
college...
ms.
narda
pierce
no,
justice
scalia...
ms.
narda
pierce
i
don't
believe
that
follows.
the
line
between
funds
for
secular
purposes
and
for
religious
purposes
is
a
line
that's
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
various
funding
cases
and
in
reviewing
government
activities.
it's
a
line
that
recognizes
both
the
values
of
the
establishment
clause
and
the
values
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
here,
simply
because
the
state
of
washington
is
extending
those
values
of
the
establishment
clause
beyond
direct
funding
into
indirect
funding
does
not
convert
those
values
into
hostility.
there's
still
the
values...
ms.
narda
pierce
of
protecting
religious
freedom.
ms.
narda
pierce
it
is
treating
religion
different
from
a
realm
in
which
religion...
religious
belief
or
non-belief
does
not
enter
what
we
refer
to
as
secular
studies.
it's...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
narda
pierce
and
that
was
the
distinction
i
meant
to
articulate.
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
justice
souter,
because
whenever
you
enter
into
the
realm
of
faith
or
belief,
0010
whenever
you
try
to
affect
someone's
belief
in
that
realm,
that
has
been
a
particularly
protected
realm
of
individual
conscience,
that
becomes
religious,
whether
it's
non-belief
or
belief.
it's
when
you...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that's
the
court's
line.
it's
the
line
that's
been
drawn
in
many
of
the
direct
funding
cases
of
this
court,
to
teach
about
religion...
ms.
narda
pierce
justice
scalia,
i
think
when
the
statute
is
read
in
conjunction
with
washington
case
law,
and
particularly
the
calvary
bible
presbyterian
church
case,
that
the
definition...
ms.
narda
pierce
well,
the
statute
says
that
no
aid
shall
be
awarded
to
any
student
pursuing
a
degree
in
theology.
ms.
narda
pierce
but...
ms.
narda
pierce
i
believe
it
would
be
under
the
interpretation...
ms.
narda
pierce
i...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
that
the
washington
supreme
court
would
interpret
it
that
way,
not
only
to
be
consistent
with
the
free
exercise
clause,
but
to
be
consistent
with
its
own
state
constitutional
provision
and
its
purposes,
which
is
to
not
use
public
funds
for
instruction
in
the
realm
of
faith
and
belief
and...
ms.
narda
pierce
what
we
cite,
your
honor,
is
that
line
between
the
secular
and
the
religious
activity.
i
believe
it's
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
the
schempp
case,
referring
to
the
study
about
religion
versus
the
study
of
religion,
which
is
not,
in
our
view,
discrimination
in
the
classic
sense
of
that
word.
ms.
narda
pierce
well,
your
honor,
in
the
context
of
this
court's
aid
to
education
under
the
establishment
clause,
and
mitchell
v.
helms
is
a
classic
example,
there's
a
distinction
between
providing
materials,
educational
materials
that
are
to
be
used
in
secular
education,
as
opposed
to
those
materials
that
might
be
diverted
to
religious,
ideological
education
and...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and...
and
we
believe
the
same...
many
of
the
same
values
underlie
the
washington
constitution.
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
distinction
is
made
invalid
because
it
is
extended
to
indirect
funding
and
doesn't
apply
only
to
direct
funding.
ms.
narda
pierce
well,
the
statute
focuses
on
whether
a
student
is
pursuing
a
degree
in
theology
and...
and...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
your
honor,
we
think
that
could
have
happened,
but
it's
an
unlikely...
ms.
narda
pierce
i
believe
the
reason
the
legislature
has
focused
on
the
nature
of
the
degree
program
is
because
it's
an
inherently
religious
program,
and
if
they
were
to...
ms.
narda
pierce
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
state's
interest
is
not
in
that
particular
student,
but
in
how
you
administer
it
overall.
and
the
way
the
state
administers
it
overall,
in
order
to
avoid
a
class-by-class,
student-by-student
determination,
is
to
look
at
the
degree
programs
that
are
inherently
religious
that
have,
or
ask
the
universities
actually
to
do
that...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
is.
the
interest
is...
ms.
narda
pierce
justice
ginsburg...
excuse
me...
the
focus
is
on
the
religious
nature
of
the
instruction.
if
someone
had
a
career
goal
to
enter
the
clergy
and
yet
took
a
secular
course
of
education,
they
would
not
be
denied
funding.
certainly
one
of
the
underlying
values
of
our
freedom
of
religion
clauses
at
the
federal
and
state
level
is
not
to
require
people
to
support
the
promotion
of
a
doctrine
or
religious
belief
with
which
they
may
not
agree,
and
that,
returning
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
is...
is
the
interest.
the
way
it's
implemented
by
washington,
and
it
has
been
by
congress
and
by
other
states
in
other
contexts,
is
to
look
at
that
core
course
of
study
because...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
justice
kennedy...
ms.
narda
pierce
well,
the
state's...
ms.
narda
pierce
no,
your
honor,
but
the
state
has
a
different,
although
somewhat
concurrent,
scheme
for
religious
freedom,
and
that
involves
not
just
avoiding
a
government
endorsement
of
religion,
which
is
what
the
establishment
clause
primarily
turns
and
focuses
on...
ms.
narda
pierce
and...
and...
ms.
narda
pierce
no,
and
i'm
not
trying
to.
ms.
narda
pierce
okay.
washington's
interest
expressed
in
1889
was
to
protect
the
freedom
of
conscience
of
all
its
citizens,
and
that
included
not
compelling
its
citizens
to
provide
enforced
public
funds
to
support
the
promotion
of
religious
beliefs
with
which
they
may
or
may
not
agree.
i
think...
ms.
narda
pierce
no,
your
honor,
and
that
distinction
has
been
made.
ms.
narda
pierce
it
does
not
decline
that,
and
there's...
ms.
narda
pierce
no,
your
honor.
i
think
providing
the
essential
services
that
include
people
as
part
of
our
civilized
community
has
been
distinguished
from
other
kind
of
funding
when
these
questions
are
asked.
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
justice
souter.
there
is
a
distinction
there
and
it's
a
distinction
that's
been
made
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
but...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
purpose
of
the
state
constitution,
which
of
course,
when
it
was
adopted
in
1889,
was
not
viewed
as
greater
than
the
establishment
clause,
it
was
viewed
as
the
only
protection
for
religious
freedom
at
the
state
level,
since
it
wasn't
until
1947
that
the
establishment
clause
was
held
to
apply
to
the
states.
and
to
return
to
your
question,
justice
souter,
the
distinction
between
providing
police
and
fire
services
to
an
organization
and
providing
funding
to
assist
in
the
educational
purpose
of
that
organization
was
made
in
norwood
v.
harrison
in
this
court.
in
the
very
different
circumstance,
but
for...
for
similar
reasons,
this
court
held
that
textbooks
could
not
be
provided
to
segregated
schools
because
that
would
aid
the
discrimination
of
those
schools
in
violation
of...
ms.
narda
pierce
in
that
particular...
ms.
narda
pierce
the
provision
of
the...
the
aid...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and
that's
because
under
the
establishment
clause,
the
question
is,
is
the
government
endorsing
religion?
under
washington's
article
i,
section
11,
the
question
is,
is...
are
public
funds
being
used
for
the
promotion
or...
of
religious
belief
or
disbelief
and...
ms.
narda
pierce
justice
souter,
there's
a
distinction
in
our
state
constitution...
ms.
narda
pierce
that's
true
at
the
higher
education
level.
ms.
narda
pierce
your
honor,
we...
the
statute
says
pursuing
a
degree
in
theology,
so
i
think
it
should
be
properly
read
and
is
properly
read
by
northwest
college
as
a
student
who
is,
during
the
academic
terms
that
are
funded,
working
toward
that
degree
in
theology.
ms.
narda
pierce
i
believe
he...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
your
honor.
i...
ms.
narda
pierce
you're
partially
correct,
justice
stevens.
i
think
he
could
have
taken
some
of
the
same
religion
courses.
i
don't
think
just
simply
declaring
your
major
later
is
what
meets
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
statute
says
are
you
pursuing...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
narda
pierce
well,
the
theology
degree,
your
honor,
does
require,
i
believe
at
northwest,
125
credits,
and
79
of
those
credits
are
required
to
be
in
various
bible
and
theological
courses,
so
i
think
it
is...
it
would
be
possible,
but
unusual,
for
another
student
to
have
those
same
courses
and
not
being
pursuing
a
degree
in
theology.
ms.
narda
pierce
justice
breyer,
i
believe
it
is
a
rational
basis
test,
that
is,
it
is
a
neutral
line,
it's
a
recognized
line
between
the
secular
that
does
not
involve
the
realm
of
belief
and
faith,
and
a
religious
that
does.
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is,
and...
ms.
narda
pierce
that
is
the
question
on
which
cert
was
granted,
and...
ms.
narda
pierce
because
it
is
a
neutral
line...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
and
justice
breyer...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes.
ms.
narda
pierce
justice
scalia,
in
the
first
instance,
this
case
involves
application
of
public
funds
in
a
funding
program,
and
we
believe
that
the
principle
that
a
state's
decision
not
to
fund
the
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right
is
not
a
burden
on
that
right,
it's
not
an
infringement
on
that
right.
all
that
the
state
of
washington
has
done
here
is
decline
to
fund
theology
studies...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
purpose
of
the
public
forum
principles
that
were
applied
in
rosenberger
are
to
protect
the
open
public
forum.
there
the
court
specifically
acknowledged
that
that
was
a
forum
for
the
publication,
for
the
expression
of
ideas,
and
that
the
expression
of
those
ideas
in
that
open
public
forum
would
be
incomplete
if
certain
viewpoints
were
excluded.
but
certainly
the
purpose
of
the
promise
scholarship
is
not
to
open
a
public
forum.
it's
more
akin
to
the
american
library
association
case,
where
internet
access
was
provided,
not
to
provide
a
forum
for
the
web
publishers,
but
to
promote
education
and
learning.
ms.
narda
pierce
we
believe...
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
there
is
a
rational
basis
to
not
fund
religious
instruction
wherever
it
occurs,
including
a
theology
course.
ms.
narda
pierce
that
is
our
position.
we
don't
think
states
should
be
in
constitutional
pincers
where
whatever
they're
allowed
to
do
under
the
establishment
clause
or
required
to
do,
particularly
given
the
history
that
states
have
come
to
their
own
path
to
religious
freedom.
and
i
think
applying
the
various
principles
on
when
you
burden
the
exercise
of
religious
freedom
leads
you
to
the
latitude
in
this
area.
here,
not
providing
funding
does
not
infringe
or
burden
a
fundamental
right,
and
that's
all
that
the
state
has
done.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd...
ms.
narda
pierce
i
would
like
to
return
to
three
points.
one,
on
the
statute
that
says
no
aid
shall
be
awarded
to
a
student
pursuing
a
degree
in
theology.
a
question
was
asked
saying
that
for
administrative
ease
the
state
uses
this
legislative
approach,
their
constitutional
command.
but
it's
not
just
administrative
ease.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
entanglement.
should
the
state
be
involved
in
a
class-by-class
assessment
of
whether
it...
it
individually,
it
should
be
categorized
as
religious
instruction
or
not.
ms.
narda
pierce
for
purposes
of
the
establishment
clause.
and
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
our
state
supreme
court
has
questioned
in
a
dissent
in
the
gallway
v.
grimm
case,
some
justices
of
our
state
supreme
court
have
asked,
is
focusing
on
the
degree
program
sufficient
for
our
state
constitution?
but
we
believe
there
are
good
reasons
for
it
that's
not
yet
been
addressed
by
our
court,
and
that's
to
avoid
that
kind
of
class-by-class
determination,
not
necessary
in
witters
because
there
the
focus
is,
does
the
establishment
clause...
is
it
violated
by
government
endorsement?
but
washington
does
take
a
different
approach
to
both
prongs,
both
twin
prongs
of
religious
freedom,
and
this
is
my
second
point.
for
purposes
of
funding,
it
looks
beyond
government
endorsement
and
looks
to
the
freedom
of
conscience
in
religious
matters
of
a
broader
range
of
citizens,
including
citizens
who
may
not
want
to
have
their
compelled
tax
payments
used
for
religious
instruction.
so
it's
the
same
principle.
it
doesn't
become
hostility
to
religion
just
because
it
extends
that
one
principle
beyond
what
the
establishment
clause
requires.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
of
washington
also
puts
greater
restrictions
on
government
where
their
regulations
may
impact
someone's
free
exercise
of
their
religion
so
that
unless
a
state...
the
state
can
show
a
substantial
need,
certain
regulatory
laws
cannot
be
applied
in
a
fashion
that
burdened
the
free
exercise.
the
munns
v.
martin
case
is
a
classic
example
that
we
have
cited
to
the
court.
it's
a
case
where
historic
landmark
laws
could
not
prevent
a
church
from
building
a
pastoral
center
because
the
historic
landmark
laws
were
deemed
not
to
be
substantially
needed
by
the
state
to
protect
the
public.
so
we
do
think
there
is
wide
latitude,
and
my
final
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
this
court
has
accorded
the
states
wide
latitude
in
funding
decisions
for
the
states
to
make
their
own
policy
judgments.
here,
all
the
state
has
done
has
been
to
decline
to
fund
religious
instruction
wherever
it
occurs,
including
in
a
theology
degree
program.
we
have
not
overstepped
our
bounds
by
imposing
an
unconstitutional
condition
on
mr.
davey
as
a
recipient.
in
the
overall
picture,
we're
not
suppressing...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
scalia,
that...
ms.
narda
pierce
yes,
justice...
well,
that
can
happen
in
a
rare
circumstance.
we
believe
that
there's
a
good
reason
to
use
that...
ms.
narda
pierce
that's
what
the
statute
permits
now.
some
justices
of
our
state
supreme
court
have
expressed
the
same
question
whether
that
is
possible.
thank
you,
mr....
