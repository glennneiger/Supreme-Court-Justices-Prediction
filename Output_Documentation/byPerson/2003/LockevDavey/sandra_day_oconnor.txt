justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is...
is
it
a
program
at
issue
here
that
provides
basically
money
to
the
student
to
be
spent
as
the
student
wishes?
is
it
like
a
voucher
program
in
that
sense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
how
it
works,
whether
it's
like
a
voucher
program,
you
give
the
money
to
the
student
and
the
student
decides
how
to
use
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how...
how
many
states
have
similar
provisions
in
their
constitutions
or
laws?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
if...
what
if
a
state
prohibited
only
the
study
of
theology
from
a
catholic
perspective?
would
that
survive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
an
establishment
clause
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
been
litigated
under
the
establishment
clause,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
providing
textbooks
or
other
aid
to
religious
schools.
those
have
been
establishment
clause
challenges,
and
we
had
a...
the
witters
case
from
your
state,
and
determined
that
the
establishment
clause
is
not
violated
by
giving
aid
to
the
blind,
which
is
used
then
to
study
for
the
ministry,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
wouldn't
violate
the
establishment
clause,
but
i
guess
what
we're
addressing
is
whether
there's
a
free
exercise
violation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
this
violate
the
student's
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion?
maybe
it's
more
expensive
to
go
to
school,
but
why
does
that
violate
his
free
exercise
of
religion
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
suppose
a
state
has
a
school
voucher
program
such
as
the
court
indicated
could
be
upheld
in
the
zelman
case.
now,
if
the
state
decides
not
to
give
school
vouchers
for
use
in
religious
or
parochial
schools,
do
you
take
the
position
it
must,
that
it
has
to
do
one
or
the
other?
it
can
have
a
voucher
program,
but
if
it
does,
it
has
to
fund
all
private
and
religious
schools
with
a
voucher
program?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
not?
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
it
follow
from
what
you
are
saying
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i
don't
know
what
you
mean.
the
state
says
all
schools
were
going
to
have
a
program
to
give
vouchers
for
use
in
all
schools
of
a
certain
grade
level,
assuming
the
teachers
are
qualified
to
be
teachers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
they
refrain
from
making
that
program
available
for
use
in
religious
schools?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
you're
urging
here
would
have
a
major
impact,
then,
would
it
not,
on...
on
voucher
programs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
there...
there
are
quite
a
few
state
laws
and
constitutional
provisions
around
the
country
that...
that
provide
just
that,
aren't
there?
justice
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
decision
here
could
have
very
broad
impact,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
why
isn't...
but
certainly
that's
what
you're
arguing.
i
mean,
your...
your
brief
and
your
presentation
certainly
urges
us
to
go
that
route.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
have
we...
have
we,
in
looking
at
funding
issues,
have
we
dealt
differently
with
the
requirement
of
funding
something
out
of
public
funds
than
for
other
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
of
course,
there's
been
a
couple
of
centuries
of
practice
in
this
country
of
not
funding
religious
instruction
by
tax
money.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
as
old
as
the
country
itself,
isn't
it?
