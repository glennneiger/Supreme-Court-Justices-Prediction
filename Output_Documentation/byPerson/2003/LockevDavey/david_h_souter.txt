justice
david
h.
souter
you're
making
the...
are
you...
are
you
making
the...
or
is
washington
making
the
distinction
between
training
in
how
to
be
religious,
training
as
it
were
in
the
practice
of
some...
of
a
religion
that
leads
to
the
truth,
on
the
one
hand,
and
study
about
what
people
believe
on
the
other
hand.
i
thought
that
was
the
distinction,
how
to
be
religious
versus
what
religions
believe.
is
that
the
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
i
take
it,
then,
if
it
that's
the
distinction,
you
would...
you
would
agree
that
if
washington
funded
a
school
of
atheism,
but
wouldn't
fund
a
school
like
this
one,
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
one
or
both
of
the
clauses?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
the
difference
between
being
religious
and
studying
religion.
that's
your
line,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
washington's
position,
i
take
it,
is
that,
although
it...
it
will
certainly
put
out
the
fire
in
the
church,
it
won't
spend
money
for
the
purpose
of
persuading
people
that
they
ought
to
be
inside
the
church.
is
that
the...
the
point
you're
making?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
that
even
though
it
would
not
offend
the
establishment
clause
if
the
state
did
provide
this
sort
of
funding,
there
is
still,
i
think
your
point
is,
there
is
still
an
area
within
which
it
has
a
choice,
even
though
that
choice
may
not
be
determined
by
the
establishment
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
you...
do
you
think
that...
ms.
pierce,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
there
on
how
you
draw
the
line?
because
i
want
to
get
clear
on
one
thing,
and
it
was
raised
in
effect
by
the
questions
earlier
about
the
blaine
amendment,
i
guess,
but
is
my
understanding
correct
that
the
state
of...
that
this
clause
that
we
are
dealing
with
here,
and
nothing
else
for
that
matter
in
the
washington
law,
forbids
the
state
from
paying...
we'll
call
it
a
tuition
voucher
here...
that
is
going
to
a
sectarian
school
like
this
one,
so
long
as
it's
not
being
used
for
theological
education?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
answer,
there
is
nothing
that
forbids
that?
in
other
words,
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
if
this
same
student
said,
i
want
to
study
business
and
i
want
to
study
it
at
this
sectarian
school,
there
would
be
no
impediment
in
washington
law
to
paying
him
the...
or
giving
him
the
voucher
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
letting
him
spend
it
at
this
sectarian
school?
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
only
criteria
that
they
have...
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let's
assume
that
all
the
public
schools
and
all
the
private
schools,
including
all
religious
private
schools
are...
are
accredited
in
whatever
way
the
state
accredits
them,
and
that
the
criterion,
apart
from
religious
education,
is
simply
that
the
ultimate
recipient
of
the
voucher
has
to
be
an
accredited
school.
it
seems
to
me,
following
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
the
argument
that
would
be
made
in
any
case
in
which
a
state
says
we
will...
we
will
allow
a
voucher
to
be
spent
in
a
private
school,
but
not
a
private
religious
school
is
the
same
argument
that
justice
kennedy
was
suggesting
a
moment
ago,
and
that
is
that
the
religious
student
must
somehow
surrender
a
conscientious
belief
and
go
from
a
religious
school
and
seek
to
be
enrolled
in
a
non-religious
private
school
or
a
public
one
to
get
the
voucher.
and
i
don't
see
why
that
argument
would
not
be
just
as
applicable
there
as
the
argument
that
you
are
making
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
justice
souter
that's
a
wash.
justice
david
h.
souter
everybody
agrees.
justice
david
h.
souter
everybody...
the
only
criterion
is,
will
we
fund
religious
training
in
how
to
be
religion...
religious...
or
will
we
not?
and
in
fact,
a...
a
similar
argument
would
be
made
as
between
the...
the
religious
school
that
teaches
religion,
and
the
private
school
that
doesn't
teach
religion.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
show
that
the
state
draws
a
kind
of
a
funny
line.
maybe
it
was
a...
a
bad
job
of
line
drawing,
and
i...
i
have
to
admit,
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
they
draw
it
the
way
they
do,
but
on...
on
the...
on
the
basic
proposition
that
the
state
raises
as...
as
its
position
here,
that
it
will
not
fund
ministerial
education
or
education
in
how
to
be
religious
versus
funding
other
kinds
of
training,
the
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
from
the
free
exercise
clause
would
be
the
same
in
the
voucher
case
as
the
argument
that
you
are
making
here.
justice
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
hope
you
don't,
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
they
opened
it
up
at
all,
there
was
no
play
in
the
joints
between
the
religion
clauses
that
said
you
can't
open
it
up
to
this
particular
religious
presentation.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
think...
let
me
just...
justice
david
h.
souter
say
what
i
think
your
position
is
and
then
you...
i
think
your
position
is
that,
although
certain
religious
funding
may
not
violate
the
establishment
clause,
it
does
not
follow
that
the
state
must
fund
it.
but
if
the
state
has
a
general
program
for
funding
instruction,
and
this
is
religious
instruction,
it's
got
to
fund
religious
instruction
and
there's
no
middle
ground,
there's
no
play
in
the
joints
there.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
general,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
mean,
the
whole
argument
for
neutrality
comes
down
to
an
argument,
i
think,
about
the
following.
justice
david
h.
souter
about
the
following
distinction.
the
other
side
says,
washington
says,
look,
there
is
a
line
to
be
drawn,
not
between
funding
catholics
and
protestants
or
atheists
or
what-not.
the
line
to
be
drawn
is
the
line
between
funding
education
about
a
religion,
education
that
says
this
is
what
catholics
believe,
this
is
what
atheists
believe,
and
on
the
other
hand,
education
that
says,
this
belief
is
valid,
and
you
ought
to
go
out
and
persuade
other
people
to
hold
this
belief.
they
say,
that
is
the
distinction
we
are
trying
to
draw.
why
is
that
distinction
invalid
under
a
neutrality
criteria?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
rosenberger
was
not
said...
the
opinion
in
rosenberger
said
these
people
are
not
proselytizing.
and...
and
the
distinction
that
they
are
drawing
is
a
distinction
between
believing
in
proselytizing
on
the
one
hand,
how
to
do
it,
why
it's
valid,
and
instruction
on
what
people
believe
as
a
fact
on
the
other.
and
i...
rosenberger
is
an
authority
for...
for
the
rejection
of
that
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
look,
you're
writing
my
dissent.
i...
i
agree,
but
my...
my...
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
couldn't...
i
couldn't
get
four
colleagues
to
agree
with
me
on
that,
and
they
went
off
on...
on
another...
another
course.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
argument
is
good,
why
do
we
even
bother
with
the...
the
criterion
of
direct
funding
of
religion?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
we...
we
could
have
drawn
the
line
there.
