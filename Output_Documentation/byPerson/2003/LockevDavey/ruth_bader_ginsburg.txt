that
would
be
a
question,
would
it
not,
for
the
state
supreme
court
to
decide?
it
may
decide
it
needs
to
carry
that
limitation
in
order
to
be
compatible
with
the
free
exercise
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
that
certainly
the
free
exercise
clause
answers
the
question,
can
you
give
it
to
the
catholics
but
not
to
the
jews.
so
that's...
that's
not
an
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
pierce,
i
thought
that
the...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
just
to
clarify
what
i
thought
was
the
purpose
of
this,
was
that
the
state
has
decided
it
does
not
want
to
fund
the
training
of
clergymen,
and
it
cites
a
long
history
of
that.
and
it's
tried
to
be
as
accommodating
as
it
can
with
that
limitation.
i
mean,
certainly
if
what
you're
doing
is
vulnerable,
it
would
be
no
less
vulnerable
if
the
state
said,
well,
we
won't
fund
that
school
at
all
because
it's
an
evangelical
school.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
he
counseled...
wasn't
he
counseled
specifically
by
the
school
to
be
honest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
not
try
to
hide
what
his
purpose
was,
which
he
was
perfectly
open
about?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
essentially
your
position
that
not
everything
that
is
compatible
with
the
establishment
clause,
not
everything
that
the
state
could
do
under
the
establishment
clause,
it
must
do
under
the
free
exercise?
and
if
that's
your
position,
how
do
you
define
the
space
in
between
those
two
where
the
state
has
a
choice?
justice
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
the
question
that
i
asked
ms.
pierce,
because
i
think
this
is
really
what
the
case
turns
on.
is
there
any
space
between
what
one,
what
a
state
is
permitted
to
do,
what
it's
permitted
to
fund
under
the
establishment
clause
and
what
it
must
fund
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
and
if
so,
what
fills
that
space?
you've
been
candid
in
saying
voucher,
no.
if
you...
going
to
give
to
any
private
school,
you
can't
leave
out
the
parochial
schools.
you
certainly
said
that
about
this
program.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the...
the
state
would
say,
we
are
going
to
fund
professional
education,
lawyers,
doctors,
architects,
engineers,
but
we're
not
going
to
fund
people
who
are...
who
are
in
a
divinity
program.
would
that
qualify
or
would
that
fall
also?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
but
it
would
include...
my
program
includes
all
professions,
save
one,
and...
and
that
is
ministry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow,
i
think
that
justice
breyer
is
getting
at
the
same
point
i
tried
to
get
at,
and
it's
in
part
the
other
flip
side
of
what
justice
kennedy
asked
you.
certainly,
you
are
not
standing
here
to
tell
us
that,
oh,
if
they
were
more
restrictive,
if
they
said
we're
simply
not
going
to
fund
scholarships
to
students
who
go
to
sectarian
schools,
that
that
might
be
all
right.
i
mean,
you
don't
want
to
win
on
the
ground
of
the
school
was
too
generous
in
what
it
did
fund.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
be
any
better
if
they
said,
you
can
go
to
any
school
except
a...
a
church
school.
justice
ginsburg
give
me
an
example,
any
example.
justice
ginsburg
but
that's
what
i
was
looking
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if...
if
you
can
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
where
the
state
can
say
we
know
we
can
give
this
funding
to
religious
schools
if
we
want
to,
but
we
don't
want
to?
can
you
give
any
example
where
that
would
be
legitimate
on
your
view
of
free
exercise?
