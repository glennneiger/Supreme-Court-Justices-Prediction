justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
but
isn't
it
also
true
he
could
even
take
the
same
courses
and
get
it
as
long
as
he
didn't
declare
his
major
until
he
was
a
junior?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
how
it
works
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
inquiry.
is
it
not
true
that
he
could
have
taken
all
or
most
of
the
religious
courses
he
did
take
if
he'd
only
declared
a
different
major
or
postponed
the
time
when
he
declared
his
major?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
has
a
double
aspect.
in
one
hand,
as
justice
kennedy
points
out,
the
state
interest
doesn't
seem
all
that
compelling
there,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
burden
on
him
is
also
pretty
slight,
because
all
he
had
to
was
take
a...
just
manage
his
curriculum
a
little
differently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
i
just
want
to
know,
am
i
correct
that
he
could
have
taken
either
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
religion...
religious
courses
and
qualified
for
the
scholarship
if
he
just
declared
a
different
major?
justice
stevens
but
i'm...
i'm
concerned...
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
if
they
publish
any
private
school
they
must
publish...
they
must
support
all
religious
schools
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
could
not
just
say
we...
we
will
publish
all
private
schools
except
sectarian
schools.
justice
stevens
that's
the
issue
here,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
suppose
he
could
have
changed
his
mind
and
taken
another
major
in
most
of
the
courses
and
then
postponed
that
decision.
as
a
matter
of
conscience,
he
didn't
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
ask
you
a
broader
question?
a
number
of
the
briefs
discussed
the
breathing
space
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
do
you
take
the
position,
or
just
what
is
your
position
on
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
breathing
space?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
go
so
far
as
to
contend
that
any
violation,
any
time
there
is
no
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
that
then
the
free
exercise
clause
would
necessarily
kick
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
is
his
free
exercise
chilled
at
all?
can't
he
practice
his
religion
just
as
he
always
would
and
become
a
minister?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
just
has
to
pay
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was
prohibited
from
doing
something
every
other
citizen
can
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
still
not
addressing
the
question
of
how
his...
his
freedom
to
practice
the
religion
he
wants
to
practice
is
impaired
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
practices
it
without
a
subsidy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
difference
that
that
would
plainly
violate
the
establishment
clause,
and
here
we
have
a
free
exercise
clause
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
take
the
position
there's
no
breathing
space
between
the
two?
