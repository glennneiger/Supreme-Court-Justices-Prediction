chief

william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
fact
that
that
provision
is
in
washington's
constitution
makes
it
different
than,
say,
if
it
were
in
a...
simply
in
a
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
was
that...
so
this
was
add...
this
was
added
after
washington
was
admitted
in
1889?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
enabling.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's...
that's
the
establishment
clause,
isn't
it,
in
mitchell
against
helms?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
of
course,
if...
if
you
take
a
whole
bunch
of
religious
courses,
it
may
be
they
can't
be
counted
for
some
other
major
other
than
the...
the
theology.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
think
this
was
an
equal
protection
clause
case
at
all.
i
thought
it
was...
the
challenge
was
freedom
of
religion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
in
our...
in
our
rosenberger
case
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
what
the
university
of
virginia
did,
but
we
held
it
violated
the
free
exercise
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pierce.
you're
reserving
your
time.
mr.
sekulow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sure...
surely,
the
state
can
decide
to
fund
only
public
schools.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
only
when
it
starts
funding
some
private
schools
that
you
get
into
the
religious
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
want
to
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time,
mr.
sekulow?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sekulow.
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
ms.
pierce,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pierce.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases:
the
first
is
02-1315,
locke
versus
davey.
the
state
of
washington
established
the
promise
scholarship
program
to
assist
academically
gifted
students
with
postsecondary
education
expenses.
in
accordance
with
the
state
constitution,
promise
scholars
may
not
use
the
scholarship
in
an
institution
where
they
are
pursuing
a
degree
in
devotional
theology.
respondent
was
awarded
a
promise
scholarship
and
chose
to
attend
northwest
college,
a
private
christian
college
in
the
state.
although
northwest
is
an
eligible
institution,
respondent
was
unable
to
use
his
scholarship
there
because
he
chose
to
major
in
pastoral
ministries
which
is
a
devotional
degree.
he
brought
an
action
under
section
of
1983
arguing
that
the
denial
of
his
scholarship
based
on
his
pursuit
of
a
devotional
degree
violated,
among
other
things,
the
first
amendment’s
free
exercise
clause.
the
district
court
denied
him
relief
but
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
this
case
involves
the
play
in
the
joints
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
under
our
establishment
clause
precedent
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
state
could,
consistent
with
the
federal
constitution,
permit
promise
scholars
to
pursue
a
degree
in
devotional
theology.
the
question
before
us
however,
is
whether
washington,
pursuant
to
his
own
constitution,
can
deny
them
such
fundign
without
violating
the
free
exercise
clause.
the
respondent
argues
that
the
state’s
program
is
presumptively
unconstitutional
because
the
state
draws
a
distinction
based
on
religion.
in
the
present
case
however,
the
state
is
merely
chosen
not
to
fund
a
distinct
category
of
instruction,
training
for
religious
professions
and
training
for
secular
professions
are
not
fungible.
training
someone
to
lead
a
congregation
is
not
essentially
a
religious
endeavor.
in
the
subject
of
religion
is
one
which
both
the
united
states
and
state
constitutions
embody
distinct
views
in
favor
of
free
exercise
but
opposed
to
establishment.
they
find
no
counterpart
with
respect
to
other
callings
or
profession
that
a
state
would
deal
differently
with
religious
education
for
the
ministry
than
with
education
for
other
callings
is
a
product
of
these
views,
not
evidence
of
hostility
toward
religion.
such
a
distinction
has
long
existed
in
our
history.
far
from
advancing
hostility
toward
religion,
the
promise
scholarship
program
goes
a
long
way
towards
including
religion
in
its
benefit.
the
program
permits
students
to
attend
pervasively
religious
schools
so
long
as
they
are
credited,
and
under
the
promise
scholarship
program’s
current
guidelines,
students
are
still
eligible
to
take
devotional
theology
courses.
in
short,
nothing
in
the
history
or
text
of
the
washington
constitution
nor
in
the
operation
of
the
promise
scholarship
program
suggest
animus
towards
religion.
given
the
historic
and
substantial
state
interest
at
issue,
we
therefore
cannot
conclude
that
the
denial
of
funding
for
vocational
religious
instruction
alone
is
constitutionally
suspected.
without
a
presumption
of
unconstitutionality,
davey’s
claim
must
fail.
the
state’s
interest
in
not
funding
the
pursuit
of
devotional
degrees
is
substantial
and
the
exclusion
of
such
funding
places
a
relatively
minor
burden
on
promise
scholar.
if
any
room
exists
between
the
two
religion
clauses,
it
surely
must
be
here.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
