could
we
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
second
part
of
what
he
was
asking,
because
it's
bothering
me,
too.
i
think
it's
absolutely
well-established,
whether
there's
a
case
or
not,
that
people
have
thought
it's
different
when
what
the
federal
government
or
state
government
says
is,
what
we
have
here
is
a
secular
program,
we're
paying
for
secular
programs,
whether
it's
schools
or
social
services
or
any
one
of
a
million
things,
or
if
it
were
to
say,
well,
it's
a
baptist
program,
but
not
a
catholic
program.
i
think
if
they
said
the
second,
they'd
have
to
pass
something
like
strict
scrutiny
as
far
as
their
reasons
are
concerned.
i
think
if
they
said
the
first,
so
far
i
don't
think
they
would
have
to
pass
anything
like
that
kind
of
test,
but
that's
the
question.
and
i
think
that
justice
kennedy
was
saying,
very
well,
what
is
the
test?
what
kind
of
scrutiny
should
you
give
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
where
what
the
state
has
done
is
said
we
have
a
secular
spending
program.
now,
leave
the
atheist,
because
if
the
atheist
is
a
program
which
concerns
principles
that
in
the
mind
of
the
atheist
are
similar
to
those
that
are
religious
in
the
mind
of
a
religious
person,
i'm
willing
to
call
that
a
religious
program.
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about.
i'm
talking
about
just
a
regular
secular
aid
program.
what
do
we
judge
that
distinction
on
the
basis
of?
what
kind
of
a
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
thinking
of
free
exercise,
but
i'm
thinking
this
is
a
discrimination
case,
so
maybe
it's
totally
different
under
free
exercise,
but
you
see
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
answer's
rational
basis.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
well,
but
the
state
is
saying,
i
don't
know
if
we
can
escape
the
broader
ground,
the
state's
saying,
look,
we
understand
that,
you
know,
applying
our
standard
there'll
be
all
kinds
of
anomalies
that
you
can
get.
maybe
this
case
is
one.
but
what
we're
doing
by
and
large
is
to
say,
we
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
of
our
state
money
in
this
program,
we'll
do
it
subsidiary,
you
know,
the
odd
example
doesn't
matter,
but
people
who
major
in
philosophy
are
likely
to
become
priests
or
at
least
spend
a
lot
of
time
studying
theology.
if
they
major
in
theology,
or
they
spend
a
lot
of
time
studying
theology,
that's
going
too
far.
so
this
is,
like
many
administrative
lines,
a
very
crude
effort
to
identify
those
people
who
are
taking
too
much
of
their
time
in
totally
religiously-oriented
matters.
now,
of
course
that's
unconstitutional
if
we
accept
your
argument
that
the
state
must
treat
the
religious
study
the
same
way
as
any
other.
that's
your
broad
ground.
but
if
we
reject
the
broad
ground,
i
don't
quite
see
at
the
moment
how
we
can
accept
the
narrow
one,
which
turns
on
these
details
of
the
administrability
of
the
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
your
response
to
the
following
concern
that's
been
brought
up
a
few
times
but
i'd
like
you
to
address
it
directly.
this
case
is
perhaps
a
small
matter
of
a
distinction
that
doesn't
make
all
that
much
sense,
but
makes
some.
but
the
implications
of
this
case
are
breathtaking,
that
it
would
mean
if
your
side
wins,
that
every
program,
not
just
educational
programs,
but
nursing
programs,
hospital
programs,
social
welfare
programs,
contracting
programs
throughout
the
governments
would
go
over,
you'd
have
to
go
over
each
of
them
and
there'd
be
a
claim
in
each
instance
that
they
cannot
be
purely
secular,
that
they
must
fund
all
religions
who
want
to
do
the
same
thing,
and
that
those
religions,
by
the
way,
though
it
may
be
an
excellent
principle,
may
get
into
fights
with
each
other
about
billions
and
billions
of
dollars,
so...
which
is
something
about
which
i
have
written
about,
which
you
know.
all
right.
so,
i'd
like
you
to
address
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
ask
you...
just
want
a
sentence
on
the
practical
implication.
is
it
as
far-reaching
as
my
tone
of
voice
suggested?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
a
good
thing
i'm
not...
don't...
