mr.
john
pressley
todd
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
rule
this
court
announced
in
ring
did
not
change
what
is
to
be
decided.
it
only
changed
who
decides.
it
did
not
make
any
conduct...
it
did
not
decriminalize
any
conduct,
nor
did
it
make
any
defendant
ineligible
for
the
death
penalty.
we
agree
with
all
the
state
and
federal
appellate
courts
that
have
looked
to
determine
whether
apprendi
or
ring
should
apply
retroactively
and
concluded
that
the
apprendi/ring
rule
is
not
the
sort
of
ground-breaking
rule
that
overcomes
this
court's
teague
bar.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
justice
ginsburg,
my
understanding
of
this
court's
holding
in
ring
was
that
it
applied
the
sixth
amendment
jury
guarantee
as...
as
this
court
recalls,
arizona
already
found,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
this...
these
particular
aggravators
and
that
it
applied
it
to...
for
purposes
of
finding
these...
these
aggravators.
it...
it
didn't
change
the
substantive
reach
of
the
statute.
those--
mr.
john
pressley
todd
--well,
your
honor,
the
judge
in
this
particular
case
did
not
rely
on
a
presentence
report
to
find
either
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
he
found.
he
relied
on
the
trial
testimony
to
find
the...
that
the
crime
was--
mr.
john
pressley
todd
--not
under
arizona
law,
your
honor,
that
the...
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
are...
that
are
present
in
arizona
law
are
not
the
type
that
would
be...
you
could
rely
on
a
presentence
report
to
find
because
arizona
law
doesn't
permit
hearsay
evidence
to
establish
the
aggravator.
but
the...
the
key
question...
i
mean,
the
key
fact
is
that
the
underlying
conduct,
the...
has
not
changed
at
all,
that
the
aggravators
are
the
same
today
as
they
were
before
ring.
the...
it
has
the
conduct...
the
reach
of
the
statute
hasn't
changed.
all
we're
talking
about
is
applying
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
to
these
aggravators
that
the
arizona
put
into
their
sentencing
statute
as
a
result
from
this
court's
opinion
in
furman.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
supreme
court
decision.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that
the...
that
this
court's
discussion
in
bousley
or
bousley...
as...
as
you
were
indicating
based
on
the
bailey
decision,
sort
of
capsulizes
where...
what...
what
in
terms
of
retroactivity
analysis,
where
substantive...
what...
what
a
real
substantive
change
is.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
that's...
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the...
this
court
does
not
construe
state
statutes.
state
courts
do
that,
and
it's
our
position
that
in
order
to
change
the
substance
of
a
crime,
this
is
something
either
that
the
legislative
body
must
do
or
that
the
state
court,
in
the
case
of
a
state--
mr.
john
pressley
todd
--this
court
has
said
that
it
was,
yes.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
i...
if
i
read
your
cases
correct,
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
you
have
decided
three
cases
since
teague
in
which
you
have
found
that
the...
there
was
a
problem,
unconstitutional
problem,
with
a
jury
sentencing
procedure
in
a
capital
case
and
you
have
found
that
those
cases
are
teague
barred.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
my
recollection,
justice
stevens,
is
that
in
each
of
those
cases
there
had
been
a
prior
holding
by
this
court
finding
some
unconstitutional
procedure
and
that
the
case
was
in
these
three
cases
that
procedure
existed,
only
they
had...
they
were
on
collateral
review
and
this
court
found
them
teague
barred.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
in
our
opinion,
the
only
way
that
mr.
summerlin
can
avoid
this
court's
teague
bar
is
if
somehow
he
can
find
that
the
apprendi/ring
rule
fits
within
the
exception
for
watershed
changes
in
the
rule.
and
as
this
court
recalls,
in
order
to
do
that,
the
ring/apprendi
rule
must
meet
two
tests.
it
must
satisfy
two
tests.
the
first
test
is
it
must
enhance
the
accuracy.
the
second
test
is
it
must
alter
this
court's
understanding
of
some
bedrock
principle.
now,
as
to
the...
the
first
test,
we
would
suggest
that
this
court's
line
of
cases
from
1968
answer
the
first
question
in
the
negative.
that
is,
that
the
sixth
amendment
jury
guarantee
and
cases
arising
out
of
that
are
not
to
be
applied
retroactively.
as
you...
as
you
recall
in
duncan
v.
louisiana
in
1968,
this
court
for
the
first
time
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
jury
guarantee
should
be
applied
to
the
states.
and
in
that
very
case...
in
that
very
case,
this
court
said
that
judge
trials
are
not
inherently
unfair.
then
a
month
later
in
destefano
v.
woods,
this
court
decided
and
held
that
this
right,
this
very
right
to
have
a
jury
trial,
would
not
be
applied
retroactively.
and
then
in
a
series
of
cases
after
that,
this
court...
that
in
cases
where
the...
the
right
arose
out
of
the
jury
guarantee...
this
case...
the
court
did
not
apply
those
cases
retroactively.
at
the
time
when
the
military
was...
had
a
right
to
a
jury
for
a
civil
offense
that
the
person
committed,
this
court
held
that
that
would
not
be
applied
retroactively.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
well,
your
honor,
the...
i
can't
speak
to...
to
all
the
cases.
in
arizona
what...
what
happened
was
that
the...
after
furman,
that
sentencing,
the
jury
verdict
in
all
the
death
penalties
were
unconstitutional.
and
the...
the
arizona
supreme
court
simply
applied
arizona
law
and
said
the
sentence
was
excessive
and,
therefore...
because
it
was
unconstitutional,
and
therefore,
imposed
life
sentence.
i
don't...
i
was
unable
to
find
any
case
that
really
briefed
or
discussed
the
whole
question
of
retroactivity
or
whether
you
could--
mr.
john
pressley
todd
--no,
i
would
not.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
of
course,
justice
scalia,
our
position
is
that
it
is
not.
it's
far
from
it.
but
the...
all
these
cases
that
the
cross
section...
right
to
have
a
cross
section
of
the
community
represented
on
a
jury...
that
was
not
applied
retroactively.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
because
furman
affected
all
death
penalty
cases
nationwide.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
and...
and
it--
[laughter]
it...
and
it
was
a
complete--
mr.
john
pressley
todd
--furman,
justice
o'connor,
was
decided
before
teague.
and...
and
also
in
furman,
there
was
a
major
shift
in
this
court's
thinking
and
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
we
would
agree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
at...
at
most...
at
most,
apprendi
merely
extended
in
an
incremental
degree
an
existing
proposition
of
this
court.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
i--
mr.
john
pressley
todd
--yes.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
no.
it
was
a...
a
complete
change
is
my
understanding.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
no,
there
was
no
opinion
by
the
full
court
where
every...
all
the
members
agreed
or
a
majority
of
the
members
agreed.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
your
honor,
in
our
view
teague
answers
that
question,
that
if
the
apprendi/ring
rule
would
come
within
the
teague
exception,
then
certainly
in
fairness,
it
should
be
applied
retroactively.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
our
position
is
that
this
case,
because
of...
it
doesn't
increase
the
accuracy,
the...
the
teague/apprendi
rule,
and
it
does
not...
is
not
even
a
bedrock
rule,
not
even
a
bedrock
rule,
let
alone
a...
a
change
in
this
court's
understanding
of
a
bedrock
rule.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
teague--
mr.
john
pressley
todd
--teague
is
a
judge...
judge-made
rule,
your
honor,
yes.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
justice
breyer's
question
concerning
flexibility
of
teague.
and
i...
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
court
had
a
rule
that
so
increased
accuracy,
a
new
rule,
and
so
was...
changed
this
court's
understanding
of
some
truly
bedrock
principle,
then
this
court
would
not
care
how
many
cases
it
affected
because
it
was
so
important,
so
critical
and
that
you
would
apply
it
retroactively.
conversely,
if
a
rule
doesn't
reach
that,
then
you
don't
apply
it
retroactively
under
teague
is...
is
our
understanding.
the--
mr.
john
pressley
todd
--i
think
gideon
is
the...
the
ideal,
perfect
example.
mr.
john
pressley
todd
i
cannot
think
of
one
off
the
top
of
my
head,
your
honor.
these
surely
are
not.
in...
in
terms
of
your
concern
with
whether
there's
any
substance
component
to
the
teague...
excuse
me...
to
the
ring
or
apprendi
opinions,
it
seems
to
me
this
court's
opinion
in
bousley
where
you're
explaining
what
truly
is
a
substantive
change
and
you
cite
to
the
first
teague
exception
in
the
bousley
case,
that
sort
of
explains
that...
what
you're
really
concerned
with,
particularly
on
habeas,
is
that
we
don't
have
somebody
who
shouldn't
be
convicted,
shouldn't
be
punished
in
the
system.
and
so
if
it
falls
within
like
the
first
teague
exception
or
if
you
change
the
law,
your...
your
understanding
of
the
law
like
in
bailey,
or
the
other
two
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
yellow
brief,
fiore
v.
white
and
bunkley
v.
florida,
where
the
state
court
interpreted
state
law
and
determined
that
in
their
construction
of
the
law,
they
changed
the
scope
of
that
statute--
mr.
john
pressley
todd
--you're
welcome.
