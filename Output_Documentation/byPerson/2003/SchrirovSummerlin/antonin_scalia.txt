justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
03-526,
schriro
v.
summerlin.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioner
warren
summerlin
was
sentenced
to
death
in
1982,
22
years
ago,
for
the
murder
of
brenna
bailey
in
arizona.
arizona
law
authorizes
the
death
penalty
if
one
or
more
aggravating
factors
is
present.
at
the
time
that
finding
of
an
aggravating
factor
was
made
by
a
judge
rather
than
a
jury.
the
judge
in
summerlin’s
case
found
two
aggravating
factors
and
sentenced
him
to
death.
that
sentence
was
affirmed
on
appeal.
nearly
20
years
later,
we
decided
in
ring
v.
arizona,
that
arizona's
capital
sentencing
and
procedures
violated
the
sixth
amendment
by
allowing
the
judge
rather
than
the
jury
to
find
the
facts
essential
to
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
this
was
an
application
of
apprendi.
the
ninth
circuit
acting
on
summerlin’s
federal
habeas
petition
held
that
our
decision
in
ring
could
be
applied
retroactively
to
his
case
and
overturned
his
death
sentence.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
when
a
decision
of
this
court
results
in
a
new
rule,
that
rule
applies
to
convictions
that
are
already
final
only
in
certain
limited
circumstances.
new
substantive
rules
generally
apply
retroactive.
new
procedural
rules,
on
the
other
hand,
apply
retroactively
only,
we
have
said,
if
they
qualify
as
watershed
rules
of
criminal
procedure
implicating
the
fundamental
fairness
and
accuracy
of
the
criminal
proceeding.
that
a
new
procedural
rule
is
fundamental
in
some
abstract
sense
is
not
enough,
the
rule
must
be
one
without
which
the
likelihood
of
an
accurate
conviction
is
seriously
diminished.
we
conclude
that
ring’s
holding
is
properly
classified
as
procedural,
it
did
not
alter
the
range
of
conduct
or
the
class
of
persons
subject
to
the
death
penalty
in
arizona,
but
only
the
method
of
determining
whether
the
defendant
engaged
in
the
criminal
conduct.
we
further
conclude
that
ring
did
not
announce
a
watershed
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
even
though
the
right
to
jury
trial
is
fundamental
under
our
constitution,
we
cannot
confidently
say
the
judicial
factfinding,
as
opposed
to
jury
factfinding
seriously
diminishes
accuracy.
it
is
a
mode
of
finding
the
facts
used
in
many
other
countries
of
the
world,
and
as
i
indicated
in
announcing
the
prior
case,
the
principal
purpose
of
jury
trial
in
the
american
system
is
not
accuracy,
but
assurance
of
control
by
the
people.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
ginsburg
joined.
