unknown
speaker
mr.
todd,
could
we
go
back
to
what
you
opened
with,
that
you
said
this
is
just
a...
and
you
emphasized
this
throughout
your
brief...
it's
only
a
who
decides,
not
what.
but
i
thought
that
the
notion
in
ring
is
that
it
adds
elements
to
the
offense
that
were
not
there
before.
so
now
you
have
aggravating
factors
is
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
by
so
characterizing
it,
other
things
happen.
it
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
aggravating
or
the
other
aggravating
factors.
you
would
have
whatever
you
have
to
prove
elements;
that
is,
you...
the
confrontation
clause
would
apply,
everything
that
goes
with
making
it
as
part
of
the
substantive
crime.
is
that
not
so?
it's
not
just
a
question
of,
well,
before
it
was
the
judge
and
now
it's
the
jury.
because
it's
part
of
the
substantive
crime,
other
things
go
along
with
it
too,
don't...
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
give
you
a
concrete
example.
the
judge
relied
on
the
presentence
report
in...
in
this
case.
if
the...
if
it
had
to
be
found
by
the
jury,
if
the
aggravating
factor
had
to
be
found
by
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
would
that
presentence
report
have
been
admissible?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
let's
say
that
the
judge
could
consider,
or
would
you
concede
that
if
the
judge
could
make
this
determination,
that
the
judge
could,
and
judges
routinely
do,
look
at
presentence
reports?
unknown
speaker
was
it
clear
under
prior
law
that
the
aggravators
had
to
be
found
by
the
judge
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
unknown
speaker
was
that
in
the
statute
or
the
supreme
court
decision?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
it's
sort
of
like
a
mixed
case
on
the
substantive
procedural
part.
it's...
the
argument
that
it's
substantive,
which
is...
imagine
you
have
a
statute
that
says
if
you
use
a
gun
in
connection
with
a
drug
sale,
it's
a
crime.
all
right?
and
then
this
court
says
that
doesn't
mean
the
drug
in
the...
the
gun
is
in
the
attic.
you
know,
the
gun
is
in
the
attic...
that
doesn't
count.
that's
clearly
substantive,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
suppose
they
have
a
subpart
(b)
which
said
if
the
gun
is
in
the
attic,
you
get
more,
but
the
gun
in
the
attic
will
be
found
by
the
judge.
that's
just
as
if
those
words,
gun
in
the
attic,
weren't
there.
so
it's
just
like
the
first
statute,
and
that's
apprendi,
you
see.
that's
apprendi.
and
you
say,
well,
if
you
got
that
second
statute
that
looked
just
like
the
first,
this
one
does
too.
i
mean,
that's
the
argument.
and
you
say,
well,
which
way
should
we
look
at
it.
i'm
not
sure.
unknown
speaker
we...
didn't
we
make
it
quite
clear
in
bousley
that
it
was
important
that
we
were
interpreting
a
federal
law,
which
we
had
the
authority
to
interpret,
rather
than
what's
happened
in
this
case
where,
as
i
understand
it,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
has
said
the
change
brought
by
ring
was
procedural.
unknown
speaker
does
it
follow,
if
it
is
procedural,
that
you
necessarily
prevail?
if...
you...
you
do
agree
that
he
has
been
sentenced
to
death
by
an
unconstitutional
procedure.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
mean,
under
our
holdings.
and
do
you
know
any
case
in
which
we've
held
that
a
death
sentence
can
be
carried
out
when
it
was
imposed
pursuant
to
an
unconstitutional
procedure?
unknown
speaker
but
the...
the...
what
was
barred
was
considering
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
we
didn't
actually
hold
that
where
it
was
acknowledged
there
was
a
constitutional
violation,
that
the
death
sentence
could
be
carried
out.
or
am
i
wrong
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
just
once
more?
because
i'm
most
interested
in
the
capital
cases.
am
i
correct
in
remembering
that
after
furman,
all
of
the
death
sentences
across
the
country
were
held
invalid
retroactively?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
contest
that
furman
was
a
watershed
decision,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean,
the
question
is
whether
this...
whether
ring
is
equivalent
to
furman
as
far
as
watershed
decisions
go
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
you
why
is
furman
a
watershed
decision?
it
just
said
the
procedures
were
all
wrong.
what...
what
made
that
watershed
and...
and
this
not
watershed?
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
applied
retroactively.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
if
this
case
is
applied
retroactive,
this
might
be
a
watershed
decision.
[laughter]
was
furman
decided
before
teague?
unknown
speaker
yes,
which...
an
understanding
which...
which
had
existed
in
the
country
for
a
couple
of
hundred
years,
whereas,
as
i
understand
ring,
it's
based
on
a
reversal
of...
of
a
relatively
recent
practice
of
announcing
in
statutes
sentencing
factors
as
opposed
to
elements
of
the
crime.
that...
that
was
a
quite
recent
practice
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
reasonable
to
think
that
furman
was
a
watershed
and
that...
that
ring
and...
and
apprendi,
which
preceded
ring,
was
not.
it
was
just
a
correction
of
a
temporary
wandering
off
from
the...
from
the
common
law
rule.
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree
that
apprendi
just
corrected
a...
a
minor
wandering
law,
not
an
old
rule?
there's
a
question
whether
it
corrected
anything.
unknown
speaker
apprendi
purported,
did
it
not,
to
be
setting
forth
established
law?
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and...
right?
unknown
speaker
and
did
furman?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no...
there
was
no
court
opinion
in
furman,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
what
will
you
do
if...
i
mean,
i
absolutely
accept
your
point,
at
least
for
argument,
that...
that
if
you
go
through
the
factors
that
favor
calling
it
a
watershed
rule,
you've
listed
several
that
argue
strongly
against
calling
it
a
watershed
rule.
and
i
want
your
reaction
to
something
on
the
other
side.
and
i
have
to
say,
though,
i'm
sure
he...
he
will
agree
with
these
words.
justice
scalia
will
not
agree
with
the
sentiment
i'm
quoting
him
for.
but
in
ring
he
said...
he
spoke
about
the
repeated
spectacle
of
a
man's
going
to
his
death
because
a
judge
found
an
aggravating
factor
existed
and
added
that
we
cannot
preserve
our
veneration
for
the
protection
of
the
jury
in
criminal
cases
if
we
render
ourselves
callous
to
the
need
for
that
protection
by
regularly
imposing
the
death
penalty
without
it.
now,
what
i'm
using
those
words
to
call
to
mind
is
that
here
we
will
have
the
spectacle
of
a
person
going
to
his
death
when
he
was
tried
in
violation
of
a
rule
that
the
majority
of
the
court
found
to
be
a
serious
procedural
flaw.
see,
i'm
not
calling
it
absolutely
overwhelming.
so
i'm
giving
you
that,
but
on
the
other
side,
i'm
trying
to
focus
your
attention
on
the
spectacle
of
the
man
going
to
his
death,
having
been
sentenced
in
violation
of
that
principle.
what
do
you
want
to
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
justice
breyer
is...
is
arguing
for
a...
a
general
capital
sentencing
exception
to
teague.
i
mean,
you...
you
could
make
that
statement
that
he
just
made
in
any
capital
case.
no,
but...
but
anyway--
[laughter]
--the...
the...
teague,
of
course,
encapsulates
a
long
prior
history
with
justice
harlan
trying
to
formalize
to
a
degree
rules
that
will
separate
the
more
important
for
the
less
important.
is
that
fair?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
is
teague
itself
a
bedrock
rule?
it
was
judge-made
rule,
isn't
it?
it's
not
in
the
constitution
itself
or
any
statute
anywhere.
it's
a
judge-made
rule.
unknown
speaker
and
that
should
trump
the
constitutional
right
at
stake.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
todd.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
what
would
you
think
the
result
should
be
for
someone
whose
capital
conviction
and
sentence
became
final
after
apprendi
but
before
ring?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
something
else.
i
don't
think
you
cited
or
relied
on
that
destefano
v.
woods
case.
why
not?
unknown
speaker
can
we
go
back
to
the...
the
first
and
how
you
characterize
this?
i
would
imagine
you
list
elements
of
an
offense.
well,
the
elements
of
an
offense...
that
has
a
substantive
feel.
who
decides
has
a
procedural
feel.
it
seems
to
me
you
could
give
this
a
substantive
characterization
if
you're
saying
recite
the
elements
of...
of
an
offense.
that
sounds
very
substantive.
what
does
it
take
to...
to
compose
this
crime.
and
then...
well,
and
then
you
say
it...
well,
it's
just
who
decides.
that's
a
procedural
question.
you
can
characterize
this
fairly
either
way
i
think.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
do
you
think
that
the
outcome
of
this
case
necessarily
determines
whether
apprendi
is
retroactive
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
if
we
hold
this
is
bad,
we
must
follow
the
same
rule
in
apprendi?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we...
if
we
said,
for
example,
that
this
is...
this
is
retroactive
because
we,
in
effect,
have
said
that
the
sentencing
factor
is...
is
like
an
element
so
that
we
are,
in
fact,
for
purposes
of...
of
serving
the
jury
right,
recharacterizing
or
redefining
the...
the
crime,
then
that
would
cover
apprendi
as
well
as
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
murray,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a...
this
was
a
death
case
as
part
of
its
reasoning?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
said
in
so
many
words?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't...
isn't
that
because
a
lot
of
the
sentencing...
a
lot
of
the
aggravating
factors
the
sentencing
pivots
are...
are
not
only
factual
but
normative?
i
mean,
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel
is...
is
the...
is
a
perfect
example
of
it.
it's...
it's
a
how...
how
bad
is
it
kind
of
determination.
this
isn't
so
much
a
matter
of
accuracy
as
it
is
a...
a
matter
of...
of
moral
weighing,
and
does
that
fall
within
prong
one
of...
of
the
teague
exception?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
sounds
more
like
judgment
than
accuracy
is
what
i'm
getting
at.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that's...
everything
you
say
is...
is
true
so
far,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
gets
you
to
satisfy
the
accuracy
prong.
judges
and
juries
may...
i...
i
don't
know
how
it
would
really
work
out,
but
they...
they
may
make
different
normative
judgments,
different
moral
judgments
in...
in
applying
a
factor
like
this.
but
i
don't
think
it
falls
within
the...
the
category
of
accuracy.
unknown
speaker
mr.
murray,
i...
i
have
sort
of
the
same
problem
that
justice
o'connor
did.
i
find
it
hard
to
contemplate
how
we
could
have
held
in
destefano
that
duncan
v.
louisiana,
which
for
the
first
time
applied
the
jury
trial
guarantee
of
the
federal
constitution
to
the
states...
i
mean,
the
entire
trial
didn't
have
to
be
before
a
jury
until
we
decided
duncan.
and
in
destefano,
we
said
that
decision
doesn't
have
to
be
retroactive,
that
the
cases
decided
before
duncan
will
stand
even
though
the
judge
decided
the
entire
criminal
case,
not
just
the...
the
one
element
we're
talking
about
here.
how...
how
can
you
possibly
reconcile
that
with
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
here?
this
seems
relatively
minor
compared
to
the
quite
more
massive
change
in
accuracy,
if
you
believe
it,
which...
which
duncan
produced.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
those
cases
do
not
involve
the
precise
issue
that
you're
bringing
before
us
here.
the
precise
issue
in
duncan
was
the
difference
between
having
the
judge
decide
and
having
the
jury
decide.
that's
the
very
thing
that's
at
issue
here.
those
other
cases
you
mentioned
did
not
involve
that
very
thing.
unknown
speaker
the
point
is
that
they
didn't
involve
precisely
what
is
involved
here.
the
difference
between
having
the
judge
decide
the
case
and
having
the
jury
decide
the
case.
our
only
precedent
dealing
precisely
with
that
issue
says
that
the
decision
is
not
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
teague...
but
teague
does
that
too,
does
it
not?
gives
great
weight
to
the
overall
effect
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
a
different
way
perhaps.
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
separate
opinion,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
agree.
i
think
you
can
see
it
as
substantive
or
you
can
see
it
as
procedural.
but
i
wonder,
because
you've
read
all
these
cases
now,
is
that...
is...
do
you...
do
you
think
that
the
teague
categories...
how
fixed
are
they
meant
to
be?
what
i'm
thinking
of
in
particular
is
the
remark
that
actually
the
chief
justice
made
about
it
did
reflect
something
to
do
with
administration
of
justice.
so
suppose
that
you
had
a
case
in
which
it
looks
as
if
it
falls
on
the
substantive
side
of
the
line,
but
really
to
let
everyone
out
of
prison
is
going
to...
is
going
to
just
devastate
the
justice
system.
is
there
room,
given
teague,
for
some
flexibility
there?
in
other
words,
are
the
factors
absolutely
written
in
stone?
is
there
any
indication
they're
flexible
to
read
in
the
light
of
teague's
purposes?
what's
your
reaction
to
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
murray,
we
have
many
opinions
which...
which
comment
upon
the
fact
that
the...
the
line
between
substance
and
procedure
is
an
extremely
variable
one
and
that
they
really
are
just...
just
two
opposites
in
various
fields,
and...
and
where
the
line
is
depends
upon
the
purpose
for
which
you're
calling
it
substantive
or
calling
it
procedural.
now,
mr.
feldman
gave
us
what
he...
what
his
assessment
of...
of
what
our
teague
rule
means
by...
by
substantive
and
that
is
if
you
have
changed
the...
the
punishment
or
if
you
have
changed
the
status
of
whether
an
act
could
be
performed
without
being
criminally
punished,
that
is
a
substantive
change.
now,
if
you
believe
that
that's
what
substance
versus
procedure
means
here,
this
is
clearly
not
substantive.
right?
unknown
speaker
if...
if
that's
what
it
means.
now,
if...
if
you
don't
agree
with
his
description
of...
of
what
the
dichotomy
is,
what
is
your
understanding
of...
of
what
constitutes
something
that
is
substantive
under...
under
teague?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
additional
5
years
or
10
years
for...
for
an
act
that
was
innocent
was
being
imposed
under
the
rubric
of
a
sentencing
factor
rather
than
under
the
rubric
of
element.
unknown
speaker
well,
it...
it
is
substantive
for
the
purpose
of
whether
it's
in
a
criminal
procedure
book
as
an
element
or
as
a...
as
a
sentencing
factor,
but
it's
not
substantive
for
the
purpose
of
whether
an
individual
knew
that
if
he
did
this,
he
was
going
to
get
5
more
years.
it's
not
substantive
in
that
sense.
and
i
thought
that
that's
what
teague
was
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
question
that
was
asked
to
mr.
wood
and
that
was
about
do
apprendi
and
ring
go
together,
and
i'd
like
your
answer
to
that.
if
we
agree
with
you
that
this
is
substantive,
wouldn't
it
follow
that
apprendi
also
would
be
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
what...
what...
could
you
give
me
a
reason
why
they
shouldn't
go
together?
unknown
speaker
on
your...
your
not
a
new
rule,
i
found
that
hard
to
follow
in
light
of
walton.
i
mean,
walton
was
the
law
until
ring
said
it
was...
overruled
it
pro
tonto.
unknown
speaker
so
how
could
it
not
be...
given
that
walton
was
the
instruction,
how
could
ring
be
anything
but
new?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
walton
was
a
blip
in...
in
the
history?
are
you
talking
about
from
the
time
arizona
reimposed
capital
punishment
after
furman?
unknown
speaker
but
surely,
i
mean,
arizona
had
adopted
that
system
before
walton
or
walton
wouldn't
have
had
occasion
to
pass
on
it.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
it
was
that
system
that
came
to
us
in
walton,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
saying
that
walton...
when
you
say
blip,
i
got
the
impression
you
thought
it
originated
something.
it
didn't.
it
just
passed
on
the
existing
system
in
arizona.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
should
that
be
a
factor
that
we
take
into
consideration?
i
mean,
surely
there
could
be
a
difference
between
prosecutors
and
the
fact
that
somebody
in
the
da's
office
thought
there
wasn't
evidence...
enough
evidence
to
go
ahead,
shouldn't
be
crucial
in
deciding
whether
the
finding
was
correct
made
by
the
court
or
by
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree,
by
the
way,
with
mr.
wood
that
the
judge...
whatever
his
name
was...
that
he
didn't
use
the
presentence
report
because
that
would
be
considered
hearsay
under
arizona
law?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
wood
said
he
couldn't
consider
it
because
it
was
hearsay.
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
judge...
no
more
than
the
jury,
the
judge
could
not
have
considered
that
in
determining
whether
there
was
an
aggravating
factor.
unknown
speaker
who
don't
have
human
frailties.
right?
juries...
juries
without
human
frailties.
unknown
speaker
there...
there
were
a
number
of
issues
that
you
raised
in
this
case
that...
that
they
didn't
get
to
below.
is
that
right?
because
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
the
ring
retroactivity.
unknown
speaker
and
they
rejected
the--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
murray.
mr.
todd,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
rules
would
fit
that
so
important?
and
the...
the
briefs
cite
gideon.
is
there
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
are
there
other
examples?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
todd.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
