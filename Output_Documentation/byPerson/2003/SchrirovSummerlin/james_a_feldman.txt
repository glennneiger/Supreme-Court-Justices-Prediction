mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
respect
to
the
bedrock
principles...
that
is...
that
is,
the
bedrock
watershed
rules
that
come
within
the
second
teague
exception...
the
court
has
articulated
that
exception
not
in
terms
of
any
rule
that
carries
out
a
principle
of
the
constitution,
even
an
important
rule
that
carries
out
a
principle
of
the
constitution,
or
one
of
the
amendments
that
have
been
incorporated,
but
rather
a
bedrock
rule.
and
the
examples
that
the
court
has
given,
which
are
things
like
the
violation
of
the
rule
of
gideon
against
wainwright
or
a
mob
dominating
a
trial
or
the
knowing
use
of
testimony
that
was...
of
a...
of
a
confession
that
was
extracted
by
torture
i
think
give
guidance
as
to
what
that
sort
of
bedrock
rule
is.
and
what
it
is,
is
those
are
elements
that,
if
they
exist
in
a
criminal
trial,
you
can
look
at
that
trial
and
say
this
was
not...
could
not
have
been
a
fair
trial.
in
fact,
the
trial
conceivably
could
have
come
to
the
right
result,
but
it
couldn't
have
been
a
fair
trial
if
those
elements
were
not
satisfied.
the
rule
in
ring
and
apprendi
does
not
come
within
that
class.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
think
that...
that
was
a
relatively
brief
period,
but
during
that
period,
this
court's
decision
in
walton
had
held
that
judges
could
decide
aggravating
factors.
and
accordingly,
the
law
at
that
time
was
that
and
it
would
have
to
satisfy
the
teague
second
exception
if
it
were
to
be
applied.
for
the
reasons
i've
said,
i
don't
think
it
does.
the
court--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--we
should
have.
the
court
said
in...
in
the...
in
the
duncan
case...
actually
the
quote
is
we
would
not
assert
that
every
criminal
trial
or
any
particular
trial
held
before
a
judge
alone
is
unfair
or
that
a
defendant
may
never
be
as
fairly
treated
by
a
judge
as
he
would
be
by
a
jury.
that's
a
quote
from
duncan.
in
destefano,
which
was
a
pre-teague
case
and
i
suppose
maybe
that
was
the
reason
why
it
was
overlooked,
but
the
court
relied
on
that
particular
reasoning
in
holding
that
the
duncan
rule,
which
was
the
whole
sixth
amendment
right,
should
not
be
retroactively
applied.
the
rule
in
apprendi
and
ring
doesn't
apply
to
the
whole
sixth
amendment
right.
it
was
long
accepted
before
apprendi
and
ring
that
any
element
that
the
legislature
identifies
as
an
element
of
the
offense
has
to
be
proven
to
the
jury.
the
question
in
these
cases
was
things
that
the
legislature
had...
was
at
the
margins,
things
that
the
legislature
had
set
forth
not
as
an
element
of
the
offense,
but
as
a
sentencing
factor
that
only
goes
to
sentencing.
and
what
those
cases
did
is
divide
up
the...
the
universe
of
things
that
just
go
to
sentencing
and
say
some
of
them
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
and
others
don't.
those
kinds
of
line-drawing
decisions
are
not
the
kinds
of
things
that
are...
that
you
can
look
at
the
commission
of
that
particular
fact
to
a
judge
rather
than
a
jury
and
say
this
proceeding
couldn't
have
been
a
fair
one.
in
fact,
judges
make...
the
court
has
recognized
that
judges
make
similar
types
of
decisions
both
procedurally
in
terms
of
the
admission
of
evidence,
in
terms
of
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
even
substantively,
in
fact,
even
in
the
capital
context,
in
deciding
the
presence
of
mitigating
factors,
in
deciding
facts
that
may
be
of...
of
crucial
importance
in
weighing
the
weight
of
mitigating
against
aggravating
factors.
all
of
those
things
judges
may
permissibly
do
and
may
do
so
fairly.
given
that
those
things
can
be
decided
by
a
judge
fairly,
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
said
that
the
rule
in
apprendi
and
in
ring
reaches
that
level
of
bedrock
importance,
that
it
just
is...
is...
necessarily
the
whole
proceeding
was
unfair
because
this
element
was--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
for
the...
for
purposes
of
teague,
the
best
definition
of
substantive
offense...
of
what
is
substantive
is
what
substantive
is
what...
what
has
been
made
criminal
and...
and
perhaps
what
facts...
on
what
facts
turns
a
particular
punishment.
the
definition
of
those
facts
is
a
substantive
point.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
bousley,
what
the
court
said
was
a...
a
longstanding
concern
of
federal
habeas
is
that
someone
is
going
to
stand
convicted
of
an
offense
based
on
conduct
that
the
law
does
not
make
criminal
or
does
not
subject
to
the
punishment
that
he's
going
to
get.
now,
when
a
court
comes
to
a
new
understanding
of
an
element
of...
of
what
the
meaning,
the
substantive
meaning,
of
an
element
of
an
offense,
what
conduct
is
or
isn't
criminal
or
can
or
cannot
be
subject
to
a
particular
punishment,
there
is
a
risk
that...
that
the
defendant,
who
was
tried
under
a
different
standard,
does
stand
convicted
of
committing
an
act
that
the
law
didn't
make
criminal.
and
that's
why
substantive
rules
don't
come
within
teague.
but
where...
what
happened
here
is
not
at
all
times,
both
before
and
after
ring,
the...
in
arizona
the
list
of
aggravating
circumstances
was
the
same.
they
meant
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
that
risk
that
the
court
talked
about
in
bousley
of
standing
convicted
of
an
act
based
on
a
finding
that
you
committed
an
act
that
in
fact
is
not
criminal
or
couldn't
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
that
risk
was
not
raised
by
this
decision
in
ring.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
would
think
they
stand
or
fall
together
because
the
court
in
ring--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i'd
prefer
not
to
be
categorical
about
that.
i...
i
mean,
if
the
court
reached
that
conclusion,
i'd
want
to
see
what
the
reasoning
was
that
the
court
used
and
see
whether
there
are
distinctions
or
aren't
distinctions
at
that
point.
but
the
court--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it...
it
may
well.
it
may
well.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
should
reach
that
result
for
the
reasons
i
just
said,
which
is
as
a
matter
of
substance
and
procedure,
i
think
you
can...
if
the
question
is,
is
this
an
element
or
is
it
a
sentencing
factor,
but
in
both
cases
it's
something
that
the
legislature
intended
to
set
aside
as
this
is
something
that's
going
to
trigger
a
particular
penalty,
in
this
case
the
eligibility
for
the
death
penalty,
either
way
i
don't
think
that's
a
substantive
decision.
if
the
question
is,
as
it
was
in
bousley
or
in
the...
the
bailey
case,
well,
is
mere
possession
of
a
gun
a
criminal
act
or
do
you
have...
or
is
something
else,
is
it
something
narrower
than
that,
it
has
to
be
active
use
of
the
gun,
that
is
a
substantive
decision
because
there
are
defendants
who
might
have
been
found
to
have
just
possessed
the
gun
and...
and
therefore
not
to
be
guilty
of
any
crime
at
all.
and
that
does
tie
into
a
core
purpose
of
habeas
as...
as
the
court
articulated
in
the
bousley
case.
the
court
has
said
in...
said
in
tyler...
to
return
to
the...
the
bedrock,
the
second
teague
exception,
the
court
said
in
tyler
and...
v.
cain,
that
not
all
rules
relating
to
due
process,
not
even
all
new
rules
relating
to
the
fundamental
requirements
of
due
process,
will
satisfy
the
second
teague
exception.
that
exception
is
a
narrow
one
because
states
have
very
vital
interests
in
the
finality
of
criminal
convictions
and
in
coming
to
closure
after
there's
been
a
criminal
conviction
based
on
a
good
faith
interpretation
and
reasonable
interpretation
of
existing
law,
that
not
having
to
constantly
reopen
criminal
convictions
as
the
law
naturally
develops,
as
it
does
with
respect
to
the
jury
trial
right
or
any
of
the
other
rights
that
have
been
incorporated.
applying
that
standard,
the...
the
decision
in
ring
and
the
decision
in...
in
apprendi
also,
shouldn't
be
applied...
don't
come
within
the
teague
second
exception
because
it
cannot
be
said
in
those
circumstances
that
the...
that
the
trial,
in
violation
of
those
rules,
was
necessarily...
couldn't
have
been
a
fair
trial.
if
there
are
no
questions
from
the
court--
