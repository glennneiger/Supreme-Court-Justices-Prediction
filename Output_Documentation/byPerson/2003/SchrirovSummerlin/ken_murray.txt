mr.
ken
murray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
go
right
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
of
the
questions
that
were
between
justice
breyer
and
justice
scalia
and
point
out
that
we
are
not,
in
fact,
asking
for
an
exception
in
death
penalty
cases
of
teague,
but
we
are
asking
the
court
to
look
at
the
specific
issues
involved
in
capital
cases
and
how
the
teague
exception
that...
that
implicates
accuracy
and
fairness
is
applied
in
those
contexts.
and
this
court
has
done
that
before
in
stringer
v.
black,
the
only
case
that
we
are
aware
of
where
you
were
looking
at
jury
instructions
to
whether
they're
old
and
new.
the...
the
criteria
and
the
specific
unique
aspects
of
the
death
penalty
and
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
you
were
looking
at,
such
as
the
heinous,
cruel,
and
depraved
one
that's
in
this
case,
were
of
a
particular
importance
in
determining
whether
the
issue
was
new
or
old.
mr.
ken
murray
it
did
in
many
respects,
your
honor.
mr.
ken
murray
well,
it...
it
pointed
out
the
fact
of
the
necessity
of
having
evidence
presented
in
a
manner
that
would
go
to
accuracy
in
a
capital
case,
especially
one
was...
you
know,
if
somebody
was
looking
at
the
death
penalty,
and
there
was
a
concurrence
that
specifically
went
into
the
fact
that
this
was
a
capital
case.
it's
important
to
note
if...
if
we're
going
to
the
first
in
the
teague
exception
that
implicates
accuracy
and...
and
fairness,
it's
important
to
note
that
at
the
heart
of
the
sixth
amendment,
we
have
the
right
to
have
all
the
facts
necessary
for
a
sentencing
decision
to
be
made
by
a
jury.
and
it's
even
more
essential
in
capital
cases.
in
death
penalty
cases,
juries
really
do
make
a
difference.
mr.
ken
murray
prong
one
of
the
second
exception?
mr.
ken
murray
yes,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that...
i
mean,
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
to
the
extent
that
this
is
going
to
categorical
accuracy.
mr.
ken
murray
it
is...
and
is...
and
that's
why
the
accuracy
i...
we
believe
has
to
be
categorical.
if
i
could
put
it
this
way.
there's...
there's
a
imaginary
line
of...
about
who
can
get
closest
to
being
correct
in
the
term
of
accuracy
that
really
hasn't
been
defined
by
the
court
in
this
context,
but
in
everyday
uses
accuracy
is...
is
sort
of
getting
it
right.
but
that's
not
what
really
works
out
here
in
these
capital
cases
because
we
have
this
normative
or
subjective
type
aggravating
circumstances.
we're
talking
about
can
we
say
for
sure
that
jurors
versus
the
judge...
the
individual
judge
would
always
get
these
issues
the
same.
and
if
they
would
not,
if
they
would
not
categorically
be
accurate
in
that
respect,
then
we
have
a
problem
because
the...
the
jurors
are
supposed
to
be
representing
the
community's
common
sense.
mr.
ken
murray
well...
well,
your
honor,
we're...
our
position
is
that
it's
accuracy
only
in,
as
i
said,
a
categorical
context
because
you
can't
ever
determine
who
is
absolutely
right
or
wrong.
it's
not
like
adding
numbers.
but
you
can
say
that
after
the
court's
decision
in
ballew
and
other
cases
looking
at
group
deliberation
and
unanimity
requirements
and
the
proper
presentation
of
evidence
to
the
jury,
that
their
role
as
the
community's
voice
for
what
their
sense
of...
of
the
moral
outrage,
of
what
their
sense...
in
determining
the
eligibility,
because
that's
what
we're
looking
at
here
with
the
aggravators
in
arizona,
is
going
to
be
more
accurate
over
the
long
run
than
a
single
judge.
mr.
ken
murray
well,
specifically,
your
honor,
we
have
two
responses
to
that.
first,
there
are
other
cases
from
this
court's
precedent
where
the
destefano's
refusal
to
find
retroactivity
for
duncan
was
set
aside
and
not
followed.
for
example,
after
ballew,
then
you
had
brown
and
the
burch
decisions,
and
they...
they
specifically
refused
to
find...
follow
destefano,
and
in
fact,
this
court
said,
rejects
the
argument
in
brown
v.
louisiana
that
destefano's
refusal
to
apply
duncan
retroactively
controlled
and
because
of
a
constitutional
rule
directed
toward
ensuring
that
the
proper
functioning
of
the
jury
in
those
cases
in
which
it
has
been
provided
can
be
given
retroactive
effect.
that
is
in
note
13
in...
in
brown.
mr.
ken
murray
yes,
your
honor.
in
duncan,
they
had
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
right
to
jury
trial
in
the
states.
we
also
have
other
cases
from
this
court's
precedents
such
as
in
re
winship,
which
was
going
to
the
burden
of
proof
to
prove
every
element
being
held
retroactive.
we
have
mullaney
being
held
retroactive
and
hankerson
which
talks
about
whether
the
states
can
make
sort
of
end
runs
around
by
labeling
issues
as
sentencing
factors--
mr.
ken
murray
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
also
you
can
remember
that
that
case
was
decided
pre-teague
when
the
balancing
process
that
the
court
used
included
a
consideration
and...
and
have
given
great
weight
to
the
consideration
of
the
overall
effect
of
the
administration
of
justice.
and
i'd
also
point
out--
mr.
ken
murray
--teague
has
done
that
essentially
to
the
extent
that
the
court
is
going
to
consider
that
by
the
definition
of
a
standard
that
is
set
in
teague.
but
it
has
withdrawn
it
as
a
balancing
factor
that's
specifically
taken
into
consideration
and
can
be
given
as
much
weight
as
it
has
previously.
i'd
also
point
out
that
teague
as...
as
a
result
of
justice
harlan's
writings
in
desist
and
mackey
and
he
himself
had
said
that
the
failure
to
hold
duncan
retroactive
in
destefano
was...
probably
eroded
the
principle
that
new
rules
affecting
the
very
integrity
of
fact-finding
processes
are
to
be
retroactively
applied.
so--
mr.
ken
murray
--it
was,
your
honor.
if
i
can
then,
i'd
like
to
move
on
to
the
substantive
and
procedural
question
that
has
been
raised,
and
that
is
something
that
has
caused
a
lot
of
confusion.
but
it
is
not
our
position
that
ring...
the
rule
in
ring
itself
is
purely
substantive
because
every
substantive
ruling
will
generate
and
will
have
flow
from
it
a
procedural
consequence
constitutionally.
so
ring
is
both
procedural
and
substantive.
but
it
had
to
be
substantive
first
because
what
the
court
said
in
ring
was
these
aggravating
circumstances
in
arizona
where
they
are
used
for
the
purpose
of
determining
eligibility
as
opposed
to
the
purpose
of
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
or
selection
under
the
eighth
amendment
due...
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence...
these
factors
are
necessary
to
establish
eligibility
for
the
death
penalty.
thus,
it
follows
that
the
conviction
for
murder
or
first
degree
murder
which
the
jury
can
make
in...
under
arizona
law,
plus
the
finding
of
the
aggravating
factor
is
what
actually
makes
an
individual
guilty
of
a
capital
offense
in
arizona.
mr.
ken
murray
well,
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
room
for
flexibility
and...
and
it
is
essential
if
you're
going...
if
the
court
is
going
to
be
looking
at
these
cases
and
trying
to
determine
how
the
result
of
their
decisions
will
affect
everybody
else
who
are
in
similar
positions,
because
the
goal
of
teague
is
to
ensure
that
people
in
similar
circumstances
receives
equal
treatment.
and
in
looking
at
the
specific
circumstances,
i
think
that
it
is
flexible.
mr.
ken
murray
if
that's
the
limitation--
mr.
ken
murray
--our
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
the
position
that
the
assistant
sg
gave
is
included
in
a
broader,
more
universal
definition
of
what
substantive
is
and
that
is
at
the
core
of
a
substantive
ruling
is
defining
what
the
elements
of
an
offense
are,
back
to
the
status
quo
of
finding
what
is
a
crime,
what
is
the
crime
of
capital
murder--
mr.
ken
murray
--well,
anytime
that
you...
yes,
but
anytime
that
you
change
the
definition,
it's
a
substantive...
substantive
change--
mr.
ken
murray
--well,
your
honor,
that...
that
sounds
of
the
first
exception
to
teague,
and
our
position
is
that...
is
not
the
entire
universe
of
what
substantive
is
about
because
in
this
case,
although
in
arizona
the
individuals
were
charged
with...
setting
aside
for
the
moment
the
indictment
issue,
they
were
charged
and
given
notice,
at
least
pretrial,
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
for
which
they...
the
state
was
trying
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
so
that
is
known.
but
the...
the
question
is
would...
did
they
know
that
the...
the
jury...
that
they
have
a
right
to
have
a
jury
verdict.
did
they
know
that
the
jury
was
not
going
to
be
determining
essentially
what
was
the
offense
of
capital
murder?
and
that
is
where
it
becomes
a
substantive
situation
because
in
arizona
they
do
not,
based
on
the
jury's
finding,
convict
the
individual
being
charged
in
a
capital
case
of
capital
murder.
it
wasn't
until
ring
came
down,
that
they
finally
admitted
that
in
arizona
from...
from
the
other
side,
but
that's
the
essence
of
the
substantive.
mr.
ken
murray
the
short
answer,
your
honor,
is
maybe
or...
or
not
necessarily.
it
would
depend
on
the--
[laughter]
--the
reason--
mr.
ken
murray
--if...
if
you
rule...
we've
presented
basically
four
arguments.
if
you
accept
the
argument
that
there
was
a
misunderstanding
of
state
law,
not
federal
or
that
it
was
an
old
rule,
which
we
haven't
discussed
yet,
we
don't
think
that
apprendi
and
ring
would
be
hooked
together.
if
it's
the
substantive
versus
procedural
issue
that
this
court
relies
upon,
our
position...
it
would
be
difficult
to
distinguish
apprendi
from
ring.
if...
if
we're
going
to
buy
our...
our
definition
of
substantive,
then
they
will
both
probably
be
the
same.
if
we
get
to
the
second
exception
of
teague,
the
one
that
implicates
the
fairness
and
accuracy,
our
position
is
that
you
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
overturn
or
make
apprendi
retroactive
if
you're
depending
on
the
specific
and
unique
aspects
of
capital
cases
that
we've
been
discussing
so
far.
mr.
ken
murray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ken
murray
well,
ring
went
back,
so
to
speak,
to
the
old
law.
first
off,
let
me
just
point
out
in
answering
the
question
that
mr.
summerlin's
case
was
pre-walton.
his
case
became
final
6
years
before
this
court's
decision
in
walton.
what
happened
in
walton
then
was
this
court
made
the
decision,
based
on
the
aspect...
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
juries'
involvement
in
sentencing
in
capital
cases.
walton,
until
ring,
was
in
essence
a...
a
blip
in
the
history
upon
which
the
state
jumped
on
to
deny
relief
in
these
cases.
in
ring,
the
court
recognized
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
sixth
amendment
right
or
lack
of
that--
mr.
ken
murray
--yes,
your
honor,
and
even
before
that.
for
hundreds
of
years,
juries
have
been
having
the
responsibility
to
determine
the
facts
that
are
necessary
for
individuals
to
be
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
mr.
ken
murray
arizona
never
adopted
the...
the
system
wherein
the
juries
would
be
involved
in
sentencing.
they
adopted
the
system
where
the
jury
convicted
only
of
the
first
degree
murder
and
never
performed
the
eligibility
determination,
although
that's
what
the
statute
required.
mr.
ken
murray
it
was
that
system,
your
honor.
mr.
ken
murray
it
passed
on
the
existing
system
in
arizona
but
for
the
wrong
reason.
but
for
a
misunderstanding
of
how
the
system
in
arizona
worked,
this
court...
had
this
court
been
presented
with,
for
example,
the
information
the
arizona
supreme
court
gave
in
ring
i
when
they
explained
that
in
the
arizona
system
the
aggravating
circumstances
do
serve
the
eligibility
purpose
that
they
are
an
essential
statutory
factual
element,
then
had
you
had
that
before
walton,
had
you
had
that
information,
walton
would
have
resulted
in
a
different
opinion
is
our
position
because
you
would
have
known
then
what
you
acknowledged
in
ring,
that
we're
not
talking
about
jury
sentencing
in
capital
cases.
we're
talking
about
making
determination
of
eligibility
for
the
death
penalty
itself
with
these
aggravating
circumstances.
and
i
would
point
out
this
is
heinous,
cruel,
and
depraved
aggravating
circumstance.
it
isn't
one...
and
this
goes
back
a
little
bit
to
accuracy,
but
it
isn't
one
that
everybody
necessarily
agrees
on
because
the
prosecutor
himself,
the
initial
prosecutor
in
this
case,
did
not,
as
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
points
out,
believe
that
there
was
enough
evidence
to
support
the
heinous,
cruel,
and
depraved
circumstance...
aggravating
circumstance.
but
that--
mr.
ken
murray
--it
just,
your
honor,
goes
to
the
fact
that
if
two
people
on
the
government's
side
of
the
case
are
disagreeing
on
it,
then
it
just
shows
the
absolute
need
and
the...
the
essential
character
of
the
jury's
role
in
determining
the
community's
sense
of
whether
such
an
aggravating
factor
did
exist
in
this
case.
now,
if
i
can
just
continue
on
the
old
versus
the
new
then,
what
happened
then
was
that
given
the
understanding
of
the...
how
the
arizona
court
worked,
this
court
went
back
to...
to
the
basics
of
determining
that
every
element
of
an
offense,
in
this
case
capital
murder,
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
the
state
is
not
able
to
rely
upon
mere
labels
or,
you
know,
drafting
of
the
sentence...
of
the
statutes
to
give
a
different
determination
to
what
those
aggravating
circumstances
are.
and
so
this
is
really
back
consistent
with
mullaney
and...
and
patterson
and
mcmillan,
although
mcmillan
wasn't
out
at
the
time
mr.
summerlin's
case
became
final.
that
was
2
years
later.
but
that
series
of
cases.
when
we
say
it's...
it's
old,
it's
as
if
walton
was
a...
in
essence,
a
new
rule
and
ring
was
a
new
rule
that
corrected
walton.
and
so
we're
back
for
mr.
summerlin
where
he's
raised
this
issue
for
20
years
since
1983,
over
20
years,
and...
and
has
sought
to
have
the
jury
verdict
on
the
capital
offense
to
make...
and
their
determination
of
whether
he
was
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
and
he
has
not
been
given
that.
mr.
ken
murray
i
do,
your
honor.
there
was
a
significant
amount
of
inadmissible
or
irrelevant
evidence
that
went
to
the
judge,
judge
marquardt,
who
was
a
judge
that
had
his
own
problems
in
this
case,
but
that
went
to
him
that
would
not
have
been
reviewed
or
heard
by
the
jury.
in
addition,
the--
mr.
ken
murray
--well--
mr.
ken
murray
--i
understand,
and
i
agree
that
there
are
rules
that...
and
there
are
rules
and
presumptions
that
say
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
consider
irrelevant
or
inadmissable
evidence.
the
problem
we
have
is
that
evidence
is
there.
the
judges
are
human.
they
have
human
frailties
as
this
case
shows,
and
in
the
long
run,
that
is
precisely
why
the
framers
of
the
constitution
chose
to
have
the
juries
to
stand
as
protectant
bulwarks
between
the
accused
and
the
government
officials
who
are,
you
know,
seeking
to
have
the
death
penalty
imposed
on
the
individual.
mr.
ken
murray
we
all...
the
juries,
the
judges,
every
one
of
us
have
human
frailties,
justice
scalia.
mr.
ken
murray
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
all
but...
they
did
rule
on
the
ineffectiveness
at
the
trial
phase
itself--
mr.
ken
murray
--as
a
preliminary
matter,
but
the
remainder
of
the
rules...
of
the
ineffectiveness
issues
and
the
judge
issues
remain
open.
and
i...
i
would
assume
that
if
we
did
not
prevail
on
this,
that
we'd
be
back
in
the
ninth
circuit
for
a
ruling
on
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
believe
i've
covered
the
issues,
your
honor.
