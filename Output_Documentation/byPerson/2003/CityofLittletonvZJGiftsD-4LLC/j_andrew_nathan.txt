mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
narrow
issue
of
the
judicial
review
appropriate
for
a
license
denial
under
littleton's
ordinance
where
clear,
objective
standards
guide
the
city's
quick
and
guaranteed
decision
to
grant
or
deny
a
license
and
render
that
decision
subject
to
effective
review
in
the
courts.
as
fw/pbs
has
made
clear,
none
of
the
three
risks
the
court
has
articulated
to
justify
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
a
mandated
judicial
deadline
exist
here.
those
risks
are:
the
government
will
err
in
line-drawing
between
protected
and
unprotected
speech;
self-censorship
stemming
from
a
censored
decision
that
speech
is
not
protected;
and
foot-dragging
when
the
government
is
the
plaintiff
seeking
to
vindicate
its
decision
to
censor.
instead,
where
the
decision
to
grant
or
deny
a
license
for
expressive
activity
is
bounded
by
valid
time,
place,
and
manner
considerations,
this
court
has
held
that
certiorari
review
is
appropriate.
that
is
because
the
alleged
risk
here
that
the
city
clerk
will
violate
the
ordinance
when
it
requires
a
granting
of
a
license
is
not
a
risk
that
flows
from
the
language
of
the
licensing
standards
at
all,
but
rather
a
refusal
to
apply
those
objective
standards.
in
short--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--typically
the
latter,
your
honor.
the
entrepreneur
would
apply
for
a
license
and,
assuming
it
is
granted,
would
then
start
the
business.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
this
is
a
case
where
a
business
started
and
filed
litigation
at
the
same
time
as
it
started
against
the
city
in
federal
court.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
the
city...
yes,
your
honor.
the
city
did
do
that.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
in
the
licensing
context,
a
requirement
of
a
prompt
judicial
decision
we
believe
is
unnecessary
and
that's
what
fw/pbs
held.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
well,
the
decision
mentioned
the
availability
of
judicial
review
as
the
second
freedman
standard.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
the
problem
with
the
provisional
license
is
twofold.
first,
it
would
allow
the
secondary
effects
that
the
licensing
ordinance
seeks
to
prevent
while
the
provisional
license
is
granted.
and
second,
it
would
allow
the
business
to
drag
its
feet
in
court,
whereas
a
business
that
needs
a
license
has
every
incentive
to
pursue
that.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
but
where
you
have
an
ordinance,
your
honor,
that
does
not
deal
directly
with
speech,
has
separate
objective
licensing
standards
that
do
not
have
anything
to
do
with
speech,
the
government
does
not
bear
the
burden
of
going
to
court
first.
but
more
importantly,
the
court
should
be
able
to
determine
if...
readily
from
a
record
that's
created
by
the
administrative
process
as
to
whether
or
not
the
decision
to
deny
the
license
is
a
subterfuge
to
deny
speech.
and
in
that
case,
what
happens
is...
is
that
a
mandated
judicial
remedy
would
require
courts
to
determine
even
those
cases
where
the
business
is
not
claiming
that
there's
a
first
amendment
reason
for
the
denial.
they're
just
claiming
that
the
denial
is
incorrect.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
but
i
guess
the
question
goes
back
to
whether
or
not
the
risks
justify
imposing
a
mandated
judicial
deadline.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
well,
cities
have
been
groping
for
a
solution
to
that
question.
in
colorado,
we
would
have
a
separation
of
powers
issue.
it's
very
difficult
to
engraft
in
littleton's
ordinance
a
requirement
that
courts
that
it
does
not
control
rule
within
a
set
period
of
time.
some
of
the
cities
have
attempted
to
pass
legislation.
some
have
attempted
to
create
their
own
court
systems.
none
of
those
is
guaranteed
to
work
and
none
of
them
are,
we
believe,
mandated
by
the
risks
entailed.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
i
do
not
believe
they
have
held
that,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
is
clear
as
to
exactly
how
that
is
to
be
done.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
yes,
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
well,
i...
i
think
that
that's
in
the
nature
of
a
provisional
license
which
would
be
that
after--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--but
it
would
also
create
the
secondary
risk
by
having
an
unqualified
applicant,
since
that
is
what
we're
talking
about
in
the
standards
that
we're--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--but
this
court
has
always
presumed
the
state
courts
will
honor
their
obligations
to
review
these
types
of
cases
and
determine
if
there
are
first
amendment
issues.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
but
that's
why
in...
in
colorado
the
rule
106
gives
the
court
the
ability
to
in
its
discretion,
determine
if
accelerating
the
case
is
necessary.
and--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--but,
of
course,
if
the
city
doesn't
bear
the
burden
of
going
to
court
and
it's
the
business
that
goes
to
court,
it
would
then
have
every
incentive
to
move
as
slowly
as
possible
because
it
would
automatically
get
a
license
even
if
it
weren't--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--move
slowly
because
it
would
automatically
get
a
license
if
a
certain
period
of
time
went
by
even
if
it
weren't
qualified
under
the
objective
standards
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
it
would
have
to
have
filed
its
appeal,
but
it
would
have
every
incentive
not
to
ask
that
that--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--and--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--that's
true,
and
i
guess
the
question
is...
is
whether
the
risks
entailed
require
that
they
be
imposed
on
the
cities
who
have
these
types
of
licensing
ordinances.
and
we
would
seek
to
prevent
the
secondary
effects
that
this
court--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--just
that
when
the
plaintiff
goes
to
court,
the
business
goes
to
court,
it
would
have
every
incentive
to...
to
try
to
go
as
slowly
as
possible,
whereas
the
incentive
should
be,
if
it
wants
a
quick
decision,
for
it
to
move
to
expedite,
to...
to
brief
quickly
and
to
argue
quickly
and
ask
the
court
for
an
expedited
decision,
and
if
one
is
not
availing,
to
go
up
and
ask
the
appellate
court,
under
our
rule
21
of
the
colorado
appellate
rules,
to
order
the
court
to
rule
quickly.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
well,
there's
never
been
an
application
for
the
license
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
in
point
of
fact,
except
for
the...
its
location...
it's
in
an
improper
zone
and
it's
within
500
feet
of
a
church
and
day
care
center...
z.j.
probably
would
have
been
granted
the
license,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
but,
your
honor,
that
issue
was
litigated
fully
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
held
that
not
only
were
they
an
adult
business,
but
that
their
arguments
to
the
contrary
were
essentially
frivolous.
now,
it
took
some
doing,
in
terms
of
discovery
where
we
had
to
provide
photographs,
videotapes,
layouts,
an
accountant's
determination
of
the
amount
of
adult
materials,
but
the
district
court
ruled
on
that
issue
and
found
that
they
were
unquestionably
an
adult
business
and
even
cautioned
counsel
about
rule
11
in
their
claim
that
they
weren't.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
well,
there's
a
serious
question
in
the
issues
before
the
colorado
supreme
court
now
as
to
whether
a
municipal
court
can
handle
a
106
review
or
whether
it
has
to
be
a
district
court
from
the
state.
but
again,
if
you
eliminate
the...
what
has
been
called
the
third
freedman
requirement
of
requiring
the
government
to
go
to
court,
then
since
it...
the...
the
business
is
the
captain
of
that
litigation,
there's
no
reason
to
force
the
government
to
mandate
a
decision
within
a
set
period
of
time.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
yes,
your
honor.
and
our
position
is...
is
that
the
elimination
of
a
third
requirement
makes
it
more
rational
to
have
the
second
requirement
be
prompt
access
and...
and
effective
access
to
the
courts
which--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--in
this
case,
however,
and
in
many
others,
when
you
have
clear
objective
standards,
a
quick
exit
from
the
administrative
process,
a
record
of
the
reasons
for
the
denial,
then
access
to
the
court
is
meaningful
because
a
court
can
readily
determine
if
there's
a
subterfuge
to
suppress
speech
through
the
licensing
mechanism.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
the...
the
licensing
requirements
in
this
case
involve
adult
businesses.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
and
so
i'm
not
sure
what
sort
of--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
they
didn't
apply
for
a
sales
tax
license
until
8
months
after
they
opened,
and
by
that
time,
because
they
had
initiated
litigation
in
the
federal
district
court,
we
had
already
determined
that
they
were
clearly
an
adult
business
and
therefore
they
were
denied
the
sales
tax
license
because
they
were
in
an
improper
location,
which
is
the
only
reason--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
--no.
that's
why
they
were
cited
in
court.
i'd
like
to
reserve,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
of
me--
mr.
j.
andrew
nathan
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
have...
i
feel
no
need
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
