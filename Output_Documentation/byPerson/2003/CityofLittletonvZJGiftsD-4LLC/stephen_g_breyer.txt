justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but...
what...
what
is
the
problem
in
the
case?
i
mean,
i...
i
had
thought,
perhaps
naively,
that
the
reason
that
one
opinion
used
the
word
judicial
access,
prompt
judicial
access,
and
the
other
opinion
used
the
word,
prompt
judicial
decision,
is
that
there
really
isn't
any
difference
between
the
two.
once
you
have
prompt
judicial
access,
the
courts
have
loads
of
devices
to
give
you
a
prompt
decision.
and
if
you
feel
the
decision
isn't
prompt
enough,
well,
you
can
ask
the
appellate
court
to
make
sure
you
get
your
quick
decision.
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
once
you
say
that,
the
courts
have
discretion
to
fashion
the
remedy,
that's
the
end
of
it,
isn't
it?
of
course,
you
get
into
court
and
then
it's
up
to
the
judge,
and
if
in
fact
the
judge,
as
i
just
said,
delays
unreasonably,
you
like
any
other
litigant
have
a
host
of
judicial
remedies.
so
what
is
it?
how
do
you
win
this
case
once
you
agree
to
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
all
against
delay.
i
mean,
i
just
don't...
i
mean,
everybody
is
against
delay.
and
my
question
is
what
is
it
that
you
want
in
that
respect
that
you
haven't
had.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
you
have
not
had...
you've
had
unreasonable
delay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
aren't...
isn't
your
client
running
his
bookstore?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what's
the
delay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that's
a
different
matter.
you
think
it
isn't
enough,
the
ordinary
remedies.
you
want
the
ordinance
to
say
in
words
judicial...
prompt
judicial
review.
that's
contrary,
i
think,
to
what
you
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
you
think
under
the
constitution
that
an
adult
bookstore
has
to
have
something
written
into
an
ordinance
which...
it's
entitled
to
a
fast
decision.
i
agree
with
you
about
that.
but
why
does
it
have
to
have
it
written
in
an
ordinance
when
a
person
who's
put
in
prison
arbitrarily
who
also
should
have
a
very
speedy
decision
is
required
to
rely
on
ordinary
court
processes
to
get
that
speedy
decision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
understand
the
issue
in
this
case
you
have
to
go
back
to
a
case
called
freedman
versus
maryland,
and
that
involved
the
filmmakers
submitting
films
to
a
censorship
board
which
could
refuse
to
have
the
film
shown.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
first
amendment
requires
certain
procedural
safeguards.
they
include
strict
time
limits,
leading
to
a
fast
administrative
decision,
certain
burden
of
proof
rules
and
what
is
relevant
here
a
“procedure”
that
will
“assure
a
prompt
final
judicial
decision.”
now,
if
you
can
remember
that,
it
was
the
issue.
then
in
a
later
case
called
fw/pbs
versus
dallas,
the
court
considered
freedman’s
application
to
a
city's
licensing
scheme
for
adult
bookstore.
the
court
split
in
three
different
opinions
but
the
lead
plurality
said
that
some
of
the
safeguards
in
freedman
but
not
all
of
them
have
to
apply.
and
particularly
relevant
here,
the
lead
opinion
wrote
any
such
scheme
must
make
available
the
possibility
of
prompt
judicial
review
in
the
event
the
license
is
erroneously
denied.
now,
that
different
phrasing
led
to
a
different
care
to
this
case.
an
adult
bookstore
in
littleton,
colorado
has
brought
the
present
case
challenging
the
city’s
adult
bookstore
licensing
scheme
on
its
fate.
we
have
to
ask
two
questions:
first,
do
the
words
in
the
two
opinions
i
have
mentioned
prompt
judicial
review,
co
they
just
refer
to
prompt
access
to
the
courts
or
do
the
words
also
mean
a
prompt
judicial
decision?
and
then
the
second
question
is
does
the
colorado
system
for
judicial
review
satisfy
whatever
requirement
there
is
there?
our
answer
to
the
first
question
is
that
the
requirement
is
a
requirement
for
more
than
a
prompt
access
to
the
judicial
process.
it
also
means
a
prompt
judicial
decision,
and
it
is
the
decision
that
has
to
be
rendered
without
undue
delay.
as
for
the
second,
we
modify
any
contrary
implication
to
the
contrary
in
the
earlier
cases
and
we
conclude
that
colorado’s
judicial
review
system
does
meet
the
requirement,
at
least
in
this
facial
challenge.
we
have
several
reasons,
the
most
importants
are,
that
colorado
has
the
same
kind
of
review
rules
that
most
states
have
and
those
rules
give
judges
enough
power
to
prevent
any
undue
delay
in
reaching
their
decision,
and
then
second,
there
is
no
reason
at
all
here
to
doubt
that
they
would
be
willing
to
exercise
the
power
in
order
to
avoid
any
unconstitutional
suppression
of
protected
speech,
and
if
they
did,
and
if
there
were
special
cases
of
problems,
federal
remedies
are
available.
and
third,
freedman
concerned
of
pure
censorship,
an
unlicensed
film
could
not
be
shown,
but
an
adult
bookstore
licensing
typically
does
not
concern
that
threat,
at
least
not
as
long
as
there
are
enough
licensed
adult
bookstores
around.
so,
there
is
no
reason
based
on
the
face
of
littleton’s
ordinances
to
fear
that
there
would
not
be
enough
such
outlets.
the
ordinance
sets
forth
specific
nondiscretionary
criteria,
they
are
easy
to
apply,
and
the
applications
deciding
whether
they
were
applied
correctly
the
judges
should
be
able
to
do
it
pretty
quickly.
so,
for
these
and
for
other
reasons
which
we
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
colorado’s
ordinary
judicial
review
rules
are
adequate
at
least
for
purposes
of
the
facial
challenge.
if
people
who
are
denied
licenses
in
the
future
think
it
is
wrong,
was
not
quick
enough,
they
can
raise
the
special
problems
of
undue
delay
in
an
individual
case.
the
tenth
circuit’s
contrary
conclusion
is
reversed.
