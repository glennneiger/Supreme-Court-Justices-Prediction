mr.
michael
w.
gross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
core
policy
in
freedman,
recognized
in
this
court's
decision
in
fw/pbs,
is
that
a
decision
to
issue
a
license
to
present...
protect
the
expression
must
be
made
within
a
brief,
specified
period
of
time
because
undue
delay
results
in
the
unconstitutional
suppression
of
protected
speech.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
doesn't
involve
a
single
film.
this
involves
a
determination
by
the
licensing
officer,
in
this
case
especially,
of
the
content
of
an
entire
business.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
fw/pbs
did
relax
the
third
freedman
safeguard.
there's
no
question
about
that.
however,
i
think
in
the
court's
analysis
of...
when
the
court
undertook
that
direction,
the
court
indicated
that
the
license
is
the
key
to
obtaining
and
maintaining
a
business.
and
that's
why
the...
the...
why
there's
every
incentive
for
a
business
to
move
forward
with
judicial
review
in
the--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--there's
been
a
lot
of
proceedings
in
this
case,
your
honor,
as
mr.
nathan
indicated.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
that's
not
entirely
accurate,
your
honor.
there...
there
was
a
nuisance
case
filed
in
the
state
court,
in
the
arapahoe
county
district
court,
and
the
city
in
fact
got
an
order
enjoining
the
operation
of
its
business.
it
was
brought
on
the
basis
of
a
zoning
violation,
sales
tax
violation,
and
sexual
business
violation.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
the...
the
business
is
operating
now.
that
order--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--with
regard
to
that
state
court
case,
there
was
an
order
enjoining
the...
the
operation
of
the
business
entered
in
september
of
2001.
the
business
made
a
motion
for
a
stay,
pending
appeal.
that
motion
was
denied
on
december
27th
of
that
year.
there
was
a
contempt
hearing.
the
business
was
moved
to
be
held
in
contempt.
at
the
contempt
hearing,
the
trial
judge
in
the
state
court,
for
the
first
time
hearing
the
case...
he
found
that
the
business
was
not
in
contempt
of
court.
in
fact,
the
federal
court
determined
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the...
to
the
bookstore
that
33
percent
of
the
business
was
allocated
towards
regulated
adult
items.
the
district
court
and
state
court,
once
he
saw
what
was
going
on,
there's
testimony
that
18
percent
of
the
business
was
devoted
to
adult
material,
and
the
state
district
court
made
a
determination
that
the
business
was
not
in
contempt.
in
fact,
the
injunction
order
in
state
court
was
later
reversed
in
the
state
court
of
appeals
in
february
of
last
year.
and
so
at
the
current
time,
there
is
no
injunction
order
against
the
business.
the
business
is
operating.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
and...
and
there
was
a
facial
challenge
filed
at
the
time
the
business
was
opened
back
in
august
of
1999.
they
went
to
federal
court
first.
the
state
did
seek
its
remedies
as
a
state
court
nuisance
action
and
tried
to
shut
down
the
business
and
was
unsuccessful
ultimately.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
well,
the
federal
courts
are...
i
think,
as
indicated
before,
there
are
some
issues
of
abstention,
comity,
and
so
forth,
and
those
issues
have
come
up
quite
a
bit,
especially
if
there's
pending
state
court
proceedings.
here
the...
the
state
did
go
to
state
court.
the...
you
can
always
go
to
federal
court
to
vindicate
your
first
amendment
rights.
and
in...
that's
what
we...
what
the
business
chose
to
do
in
this
case
on
the
facial
challenge.
i
think
once
the
case
gets
started,
once
you
apply
for
a
license
and
your
license
is
denied,
you
really
need
to
go
through
the
state
court
process.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
well,
i
think
freedman
said
prompt
judicial
review
means
prompt
judicial
determination.
i
think
the
courts
may
have
discretion
to
fashion
the
remedy,
but
again,
getting
the
case
under
the
state
court
dockets,
getting--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well,
the
core
policy
behind
freedman...
it
was
enunciated
in
fw/pbs...
is
that
delay
could...
results
in
unconstitutional
suppression
of
speech.
and
in
fact--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well,
in
this
case
there
was
an
erroneous
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
there
was--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--yes,
and--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--the...
the
client--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--the
client...
there...
there's
no
injunction
order
entered
in
this
case.
the
delay
is
that
on
its
face
that
the...
the
ordinance
needs
to
provide
for
prompt
judicial
review.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
it
provides...
rule...
it
provides
for
judicial
review
under
rule
106
of
the
colorado
rules
of
civil
procedure.
that
process
involves
judicial
review
of
the
record,
90
days
for
the
record,
briefing
schedules,
30
days
for
each
side,
15
days--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well,
the...
the
period
of
time
it
takes...
it's
a
very
long
time.
it...
generally
judicial
review...
it's
an
appellate...
appeal
to
the
district
court.
it
takes
at
least
a
year.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
california...
the
legislature
did
enact
a
statute,
as
referred
to
by
the
state
of
ohio
that--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--i
think
it
can...
it
can...
it
depends
on
the
court...
on
a
state--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well,
under
the
first
amendment...
and
this
is
not
a...
this
is
not
directly
on
freedman,
censorship
of
a
single
item.
however,
decisions
of
administrative
officials...
certainly
administrative
officials
are
subject
to
much
greater
pressures
to
censor.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
it
went
to
court.
it
did
file
a
federal
case.
it
did
open
its
doors.
the
city
has
been
very--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--the
city...
well,
the
city
indicated
before
the
business
opened
its
doors
that
it
perceived
it
to
be
an
adult
business
before
they
even
opened
their
doors.
they
said,
we've
heard
you're
coming
to
town
and
we
think
you're
adult
business.
and
so
that...
and
then
the
city
did
deny
a
sales
tax
license
on
the
basis
that
it
was
an
adult
business.
they
won't
define
what
that
means.
they
won't
put
any...
any
indication
what
those
terms
actually
mean.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
i...
i
guess--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--we'd
have
to
wait
an
unreasonable
period
of
time
to
initiate
that
case.
i
think
37
photographs
talks
about
the
60-day
judicial
review.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
the
federal
courts
are
open
to
that.
i...
i
would
agree
with
that.
certainly
if
there
are
state
court
proceedings
pending,
there
may
be
issues
of
abstention
that
we
talked
about
before.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
i...
i
would...
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
under
fw/pbs,
the
court
indicated
that
there
was
an
additional
burden
placed
upon
adult
bookstores
and
that
freedman
had
to
be
complied
with.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
i...
i
think
it...
there's...
you
get
into
the
issue
of...
of
some
kind
of
content...
correlated
content
based
restriction.
it
may
be
based
upon
non-content
based
factors.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
no,
you
don't,
not
a
special
license.
you
need
a
sales
tax
license.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
a
commercial
business
you
can't
open.
i
mean--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--there's
an
adult
zoning
provision
in--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--commercial
zoning.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
they
have...
they
have
to
go
through
the
commercial...
yes,
be
approved
for
a
commercial
zone
and
if
this--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--yes.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
certainly,
and
slaughterhouses.
there's
commercial--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--commercial
zones,
and
there
are...
and
there
are
residential
zones.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
certainly.
and--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--and...
and
that
was--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--certainly,
and
about
adult
bookstores.
and...
and,
in
fact,
there
was
challenge
to
the
adult
zoning
in
this
case
and
the
tenth
circuit
upheld
the
adult
zoning,
and
these
bookstores
are
limited
to
less
than
1
percent
of
the
area
of
the
city
of
littleton.
this--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--it's...
the
location...
yes.
it's
operating
its...
if
the
city
says
it's
an
adult
bookstore,
it's
in
an
improper
zone.
if
it's
not
an
adult
bookstore--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--if...
if
the
bookstore
is
determined
to
be
an
adult
bookstore,
it's
in
an
improper
zone.
if
it
is
not
an
adult
bookstore,
it
is
in
a
proper
zone.
it's
in
a
location
which
was
formally
occupied
by
a
fast
food
restaurant
on
a
highly--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--that...
that
was
what
the
arapahoe
county
district
court
ruled.
we...
we
were
trying
to
ascertain
what
the
term,
substantially
significant,
means.
the
city
refuses
to
provide
any
definitive
determination
of
what
that
means.
so
we
had
to
go
to
court,
and
that's
what
the
court
determined
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
yes.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
well,
we...
we
brought
the
facial
challenge
in
the...
in
the
federal
court.
there
is...
and
there
is
continuing
injury
in
this
case.
the...
the
business
has
been
cited
with
2,620
violations
of
the
licensing
ordinance.
and
in
the
event
the
court...
the
law
is
declared
unconstitutional,
those...
those
violations
would
go
away.
each
carries
a
$1,000
fine.
so
there's
potentially
$2
million
in
fines.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
the
current
complaint
is
it's...
we
brought
the
facial
challenge
on
the
basis
that
it
doesn't
comply
with
fw/pbs
and
freedman.
and
there
was--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well,
it's...
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
this--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well,
we...
we
would...
we
would
be
happy
to
live
with
the
tenth
circuit
order,
for
sure.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
well,
the
city
says
we
do.
[laughter]
but
we
do
have...
there
is
an
injury
in
fact
in
this
case
because
the
city
has
initiated
2,620
license
violations,
up
to
$2
million
in
fines
in
a
municipal
court.
that...
that's
a
real
injury.
and,
i
mean,
this
isn't
the
case
like
or
pap's
or
like
waukesha.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
well,
we
went
to
federal
court
and
the...
the
city,
you
know,
did
pursue
their
claims
in
state
court.
certainly,
i
mean,
the...
the
business
can't
be
faulted
for...
too
much
for
being
a
business.
i
mean,
in
the
waukesha
case
and
in
the
pap's
case,
those
businesses
were
out
of
business.
i
mean--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the...
with
regard
to
a...
an
ongoing
business,
as
opposed
to
an
individual
work
of
art,
getting
the
license
is
key...
is
key
to
the...
to
the
ability
to
maintain
a
business.
and
so
an
investor,
an
entrepreneur,
trying
to
start
a
business,
hire
employees,
get
a
location,
supply
inventory,
needs
an
assurance
that
there
will
be
a
decision
within
a
specific
period
of
time
by
a
court.
this
is
not
your
run-of-the-mill
administrative
decision.
this...
this
involves
the
first
amendment
issue
based
upon
content
of
the
speech,
based
upon
this
ordinance
that
is
focused
upon
one
class
of
businesses
that--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well,
i
think
the
states...
they
need
to...
it's
our
position
they
need
to
expedite
the
judicial
review,
and...
and
the
provisional
license
doesn't
really
solve
the
problem.
i
would
note
that
the
municipal
court...
the
municipalities
do
have
the
ability
to...
to
enact
laws,
to
have
review
in
the
municipal
court.
in
fact,
last
week
i
just
went
through
a
process
where
there's
a
requirement
that
review
occur
within
75
days
of
the
administrative
decision.
that
was
in
aurora,
colorado.
and
that
ordinance
is
attached
to
our
response
for
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
no.
well,
it
depends
on
how
it
comes
out.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
but...
but
certainly--
[laughter]
and
we're...
we
may
well
prevail
in
that
case,
but
certainly
we
have
a
right
to
an
appeal.
in
this
case,
we
prevailed
on
the
appeal
in
the
court
of...
state
court
of
appeals
and
the
tenth
circuit
on
this
issue.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
it
may
well
be,
your
honor.
i
think
the...
you
know,
in
that...
there
may...
it
may
be...
it
may
well
be
adequate
if
there's
an
independent
judicial
officer
as
opposed
to
a...
a
licensor,
you
know,
going
back
to
the
printing
act
of
1662,
a
licensor
of
speech
of
a
bookseller.
and
here
the
definition
of
adult
bookstore
is...
is
really
dim
and
uncertain.
we
don't
know
what
it
means.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
we're
not
talking
about
a
licensor
that
talks
a
specific
book.
we--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--this
would
be
the
city
of
littleton
municipal
court
or
the
city
of
aurora
is
the
one
i
was
referring
to
before.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
on
that
day?
i
mean,
that
was
the
federal
court's
decision.
the
tenth
circuit
did
affirm
the
decision,
in
little
bit
less
harsh
terms
than
the
district
court,
but
certainly
the
decision
was
affirmed.
that
is
the
final
determination
in
this
part
of
the
case.
the
business--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well,
in
response
to
that
court
order,
the
business
has
changed
its
operation
quite
a
bit.
this
is
not
a...
a
theater.
this
is
not
an
arcade.
this
is
not
a
cabaret
with
live
entertainment.
this
is
a
store
that
has
a
certain
percentage
of
its
stock
and
trade
in
regulated
adult
material.
it
reduced
that
number.
it
created
a
separate
section.
it's
tried
to
comply
with
the
city.
it
is
willing
to
comply
even
further
as
long
as--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--yes,
yes.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
yes.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
yes.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
no,
we
don't.
the
court
does
not.
i
would
note
that,
however,
the...
the
city
says
that
there's
no
discretion
in
this
case,
that
it's
purely
a
ministerial
decision.
and
to
the
extent
that
there's
inherent
vagueness
in
the
definition
of
substantial
and
significant,
it
indicates
that
a
licensing
official
can,
in
fact,
exercise
judgment
and
exercise
some
discretion--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--that...
that's...
it's
correct.
i'm
just--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--and
that--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--yes.
and
that
is--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--yes.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
no.
no,
that's...
i'm
just
trying
to
counter
their
argument,
but
certainly
it
really
doesn't
matter
if
there's
discretion
of
not.
it's
our
position
that
even
if
there's
not
discretion,
there
needs
to
be
a
prompt
judicial
determination.
the
licensors
are
subject
to
many
pressures.
they're...
they're
humans.
it's
a
human
situation
and
as
the
tenth
circuit
recognized,
these
businesses
are
very
unpopular.
these
businesses
can
be
subject
to
a...
the
discretion
in...
in
the
decision.
and
there
needs
to
be
a
prompt--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--well,
i
would...
those
are
laws
of
general
application,
and
certainly
an
adult
bookstore,
if
it
went
through
the
normal
process,
would
have
to
go
through
the
same
process
as
any
other
bookstore
or
any
other
commercial
business
or...
or
the
residential
person
adding
an
addition.
in
this
case
they've
created
a
special
burden
upon
adult
bookstores.
the
city...
if
the
adult
bookstore
opens
or
any
bookstore
opens
and
doesn't
follow
along
with
these...
with
these
particular--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--there's
additional
burdens
in
terms
of
licensing
fees,
inspections,
applications.
there's
additional
burdens
for
hours
of
operation,
for...
cabarets
and
arcades
have
additional
restrictions,
regulations
that
don't
apply
to
this
store.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
arguably
they...
they
raise
first
amendment
concerns
in
terms
of
time,
place,
and
manner
arguments,
and
i
think
there
may...
there's
a
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
it
may
be
before
this
court
on
a
cert
petition
with
regard
to
an
hours
operation.
but
they
arguably
raise
that
there
are
additional
burdens.
just
like
in
fw/pbs,
there
was
an
additional
burden
placed
upon
these
stores
on...
by
virtue
of
the
content
of
the
material
that
is
sold
and
distributed
from
the
bookstore.
now,
there's
been
many
proceedings
in
state
court
in
this
case
and
that's...
that's
what
we've
talked
about.
the
court...
in
fact,
there
was
an
injunction
issued
and
the
state
has
the
power
to
enforce
laws
of
health,
safety,
and
welfare
against
the
bookstore.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
we...
we
have
worked
out
an
agreement
with
the
city
where
they
do
pay
the
sales
tax.
they
did
not
grant
the
license,
but
we
have
managed
to
resolve
that
issue.
the
store
has
been
collecting
sales
tax
and
has
been
paying
the
sales
tax.
but
the
city...
and
at
the
current
time,
the
city
has
not
moved
to
follow
up
on
their...
their
nuisance
case
in
state
court
to
enjoin
for
not
having
a
sales
tax
license.
of
course,
that...
that
is
based
upon
the...
whether
the
definition
of
a
store
is
adult
or
not
adult.
but
the
city
retains
the
power
to...
to
enforce
the
law
through
nuisance
cases,
just
like
any
other
case,
in
time...
with
regard
to
health,
safety,
and
welfare
of
businesses.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
they
could
enforce
those
too.
the
license...
the
zoning
law
would
be
a
secondary
effects
law,
and
there...
and
at
this
point
there
is
no
injunction
in
state
court.
the
city
is
not
proceeding
on
that
case
at
this
point,
in
which
there's
an
injunction
issued
based
upon
the
state
court
order...
excuse
me...
the
federal
court
order.
that
injunction
was
reversed
on
appeal
in
the
state
court.
there's
been
litigation
on
all
different
fronts
in
this
case,
in
state
court,
district
court,
municipal
court,
as
well
as
the
federal
court.
of
course,
we're
here
on
the
federal
case.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
we...
it's...
you
can
file
a
lawsuit.
i
mean,
there's...
certainly
you
can...
you
have
a
right
to
file
a
lawsuit
everywhere
you
can,
and
we've...
we've...
there
has
been
lawsuits
filed
by
both
the
city.
and
the
city
had
access
on
the...
on
the
injunction
case.
there
was
a
stay
denied,
in
fact,
after...
after
the
injunction
was
issued.
i
mean,
this
business
has
been
fighting
to
stay
open.
it's
been
fighting
and
has
stayed...
in
fact,
stayed
open
unlike
the
case
in
waukesha
and
pap's,
you
know.
i
mean,
it's
clear
municipalities
have
taken
every
opportunity
to
try
to
regulate
these
businesses,
try
to
put
in
every
obstruction
possible
with
regard
to
getting
these
businesses
to...
to
be
closed
down.
now,
the
issue...
the
answer
to
the
question
before
this
court
is
that
the
essential
constitutional
requirement...
and
that
was
identified
in...
in
the
fw/pbs
case
as
an
essential
requirement...
is
that
prompt
judicial
determine
does
actually
mean
prompt
judicial...
does
mean
prompt
judicial
determination
without
an
actual--
mr.
michael
w.
gross
--that's
correct,
based
upon
freedman.
and
if...
if
we
take
it
back
to
freedman,
you
read
freedman
and
freedman
does...
did
provide
a
right
of
access,
a
right
of
appeal
and
talked
about
judicial
review
interchangeably
with
prompt
judicial
determination,
disposition,
and
so
forth.
now,
without
an
actual
judicial
disposition,
the
administrative
officials
will
have
the
power
to
shut
down
an
entire
business,
not
simply
a
single
work
of
art,
but
it
will
be
an
entire
business.
if
there's
an
error...
if
there's
an
error
with
regard
to...
to
what
is...
what
the
licensing
official
says,
that's
why
prompt
judicial
review
is
so
important
in
this
case.
the
erroneous
deprivation
of
the
speech
rights
will...
will
cause
irreparable
injury,
and
that's
the
core
policy
behind
the
freedman
case.
now,
in
the
absence
of
prompt
judicial
review,
the...
the
status
quote
will
be
silenced.
in
this
case,
the
bookstore
went
to
court
and
get...
got
the
access,
but...
and
the
trial
court
will
be
understandably
reluctant
to
alter
the
status
quo
of
silence.
and
that
is
essentially
the
default
position
of
any
trial
court.
so
without
an
explicit
statement
from
this
court
with
regard
to
the
second
prong
of
freedman,
it's
not...
i
think
it's
difficult
to
assume
that
a
state
court
with
its
heavy
docket
will
actually
provide
a
prompt
decision.
mr.
michael
w.
gross
well,
yes,
this
law
was
enacted
in
1993.
it's
been
amended
many
times.
in
this
case,
the
state
nuisance
action
was
filed
in
january
of
2000,
and
the
district
court
issued
its
order
in
september
of
2001,
and
that
order
was
reversed
in
february
of
2003.
that's
the
normal
course
of...
of
events
in
the
state
court
litigation.
the
city
did
not
move
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
they
did
move
for
contempt.
it
took
a
few
months
to
get
the
contempt
heard,
and
once
the
contempt
was
heard,
it
came
out
in
favor
of
the
bookstore.
so
that's...
that's
the
experience
in
this
case.
this
is
the
only
adult
business
that's
ever
existed
in
the
city
of
littleton.
there's
never
been
one
before.
there
were
apparently
a
couple
of
massage
parlors
about
10
years
ago.
and
the
city
has
put--
