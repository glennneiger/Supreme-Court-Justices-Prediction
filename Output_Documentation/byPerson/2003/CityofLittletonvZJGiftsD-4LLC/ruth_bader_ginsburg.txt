mr.
nathan,
would
you
explain
to
me
how
this
generally
operates
with
adult
shops?
in
the...
in
the
film
context,
the
film
can't
be
shown.
these
were
in
the
old
days
when
they
had
censure
boards.
so
there
was
a
great
impetus
to
have
quick
action.
but
here,
i
take
it
that
the
business
was
up
and
running
and
it
was
the
city
that
said
you
need
a
license.
and
my
question
is,
do
these
questions...
does
the
business
start
first
and
the
city
come
in
and
say
you
need
a
license,
or
do...
does
the
entrepreneur
wait
until...
and...
and
apply
for
a
license
before
starting
up
in
business?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
is
an
atypical
case
where
the
business
was
running
and
the
city
came
in
and
said,
you
need
a
license?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
serious
is
the
burden?
i
mean,
there
are
now
a
few
circuits
that
have
said
that
prompt
judicial
resolution,
not
merely
access,
is
required.
i
think
it's
the
fourth,
sixth,
and
ninth.
what
has
been
the
resolution
there?
what
have
cities
done?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
say
they're
not
an
adult
business,
and
that's
the
preliminary
characterization.
i
mean,
they...
they
don't
have
a
license.
they
didn't
apply
for
one
because
they
said,
we
don't
need
a
license.
we're
not
that
kind
of
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
the
federal
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is...
is
there
no
court,
municipal
level
court,
in
colorado
as
there
was
in
baltimore?
i
mean,
the...
the
reaction
of
maryland
to
the
freedman
case
was
to
set
up
a
proceeding
in
the
baltimore
city
court,
and
it
had
explicit
time
lines.
and
then
it
provided
for
an
expedited
appeal
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
so
why...
i...
i
thought
that
the
fw/pbs
case
said,
we're...
we're
not
going
to
follow...
the...
the
government
has
to
go
into
court
because
it
isn't
like
censorship.
but
the
other
two
apply.
so
why
don't
you
just...
why
isn't
that
the
solution,
the
one
that
was
adopted
in
freedman
for...
for
the
proceedings
in
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
everyone
who
complains
about
administrative
action,
adverse
administrative
action,
has
a
right
to
promptly
open
the
door.
so
that,
if
you
read
it
to
just
to
say
access,
then
it
essentially
does
nothing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
curious
feature
in
this
and
maybe
you
could
explain
it
to
me.
apparently
this
business
was
denied
a
sales
tax
license
and
yet
they
were
in
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can...
can
a
business
start
up
and...
a
retail
business
without
such
a
license?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
does
prompt
access
mean
as
opposed
to
relaxed
access?
i...
i
just
don't
understand
the
content
of
prompt
access
if...
if
access
is
getting
into
court.
that's
easy.
you
file
a
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
need
a
license
to
open
an
ordinary
bookstore
in
littleton?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
need
a
license.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what...
what
is
the
commercial
other
than
if
they...
if
they're
going
to
set
it
up
in
a
place
where
you
can
have
businesses...
in
other
words,
there
isn't
the
same
license
requirement
for
these
two
businesses.
there's
a
special
licensing
requirement
for
adult
bookstores
because
of
their
secondary
effects.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
bookstore
now
operating
in
a
place
where
it
isn't
permitted
to
be
under
the
littleton
ordinance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
what
i
don't
understand
is
you...
you
are
concerned
about
the...
the
efficacy
of
judicial
review.
you
picked
your
forum.
you
picked
the
federal
court
rather
than
the
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
got
a
review
of
that
ordinance,
every
piece
of
it,
for
constitutionality.
i
don't
understand
what
complaint
you
have
now
about
judicial
review,
having
had
judicial
review
in
the
federal
court
and
having
had
the
federal
court
uphold
most
of
this
ordinance.
so
you've...
you've
had
judicial
review.
how...
how...
how
are
you
a
proper
complainant
about
what
access
you
might
have
had
in
the
state
courts
if
you
chose
to
go
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
the...
the
unconstitutional
area
left
is
this
prompt
judicial
review,
but
you've
already
had
judicial
review.
that's
why
i
don't
understand
what
is
your
current
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the...
if
the
municipal
court
was
good
enough
in
freedman,
where
you
had
a
real
censorship
problem,
why
shouldn't
it
be
adequate,
entirely
adequate,
for
adult
bookstores?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would...
would
you
explain
one
puzzling
thing?
mr.
nathan
told
us
that
the
district
court
said,
of
course,
they're
an
adult
bookstore.
that's
so
clear.
on
that
basic
characterization
whether
you
are
or
are
not
an
adult
business,
the
federal
court,
according
to
mr.
nathan,
said
you
were
an
adult
business.
is
that
over
and
done
with
now
so
what
you're
left
with
is
you
are
an
adult
business
and
you
have
to
get
a
license?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet,
you're
still
operating
in
a
place
where
you
can't
be
if
you
are
an
adult
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
sales
tax?
you're
still
operating
without
a
sales
tax
license,
but
you're
selling
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
enforce
the
licensing
law.
enforce
the
secondary...
go
after
the
secondary
effects
nuisance
laws.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
sounds
like
you've
got
a
lot
of
access.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
experience
in
that
regard?
this
ordinance
has
been
on
the
books
for
a
time.
have
the
state
courts
been
dragging
their
heels?
