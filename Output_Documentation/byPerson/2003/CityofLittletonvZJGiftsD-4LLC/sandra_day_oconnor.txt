the
freedman
case
seemed
to
require
prompt
judicial
determination,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it's
your
position
that
the
subsequent
case
involving
pbs
changed
that
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
surprises
me
to
hear.
i
didn't
know
that's
what
we
had
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what...
what
about
the
proposal
some
of
the
states
have
made
whereby
a
provisional
license
could
be
given
pending
the
eventual
judicial
determination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cole,
do
you
know
whether
there
are
any
license...
city
licensing
schemes
that
say
if
the...
in
the
administrative
proceeding
it's
determined
that
the
license
should
issue
and
it
is
the
city
that's
appealing,
that
then
it
has
to
be
expedited?
on
the
other
hand,
if
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
it's
determined
the
license
should
not
issue,
then
there
the
burden
would
be
on
the
appellant
applicant
for
the
license
to
go
forward.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
there...
has
there
ever
been
any
proceeding
here
at
all
to
determine
what
the
issues
are?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but...
but
they're
all
on
a
challenge
to
the
overall
constitutionality
of
the...
of
the
city
ordinance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it...
is
it
operating
now,
the
business?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
what
basis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
happened
to...
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
it
does
say
prompt
judicial
review
in
the
sense
of
access.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
doesn't
it
say?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
like
the
briefing
schedule.
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
administrative
procedures
the
city
provides
here
all
have
these
prompt
deadlines.
you...
and...
and
your
business
did
not
apply
for
that.
it
just
opened
its
doors
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
business
knew,
when
it
did
that,
that
it
was
omitting
the
city
review
altogether,
although
it
had
been
available
very
promptly.
so
i...
it's
hard
to
get
a
focus
on
what...
how...
how
your
client
has
been
hurt.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it's...
i
didn't
hear
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position
that
if
you
just
sell
18
percent
of
the
merchandise
is
adult,
then
it
doesn't
qualify?
justice
o'connor
i
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
issue
is
not
before
us
and
isn't
open.
that's
been
decided,
hasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
can
take
this
case
and
decide
it
on
the
basis
this...
that
it
is
an
adult
bookstore
we're
talking
about--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
must
get
a
license.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
don't
have
to
get
tangled
up
in
this
other
business,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
issue
is
not
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
were
just...
i
thought
we
took
the
case
to
decide
whether
the
requirement
for
prompt
judicial
review
means
prompt
judicial
decision
at
the
end
of
the
day
or
just
prompt
access
to
the
review.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
a
split
of
authority
on
that
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
what
we
took
the
case
to
decide.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
whether
there's
substantial
discretion
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
didn't
say
it
in...
it
said
prompt
judicial
review,
whatever
that
meant.
