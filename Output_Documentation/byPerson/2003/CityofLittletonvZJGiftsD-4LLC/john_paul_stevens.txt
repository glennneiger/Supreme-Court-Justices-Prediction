justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
general
question?
i
understand
the
standards
are
different,
but
just
in
terms
of
the
procedure,
if
i
applied
for
a
license
to
run
a
dry
cleaning
establishment,
would
i
have
a
different
procedural
set
of
hurdles
than
this
litigant
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
the
standards
are
different
to
qualify
for
it,
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
you're
denied
the...
the
license,
are
you
treated
any
differently
than
if
i
had
applied
for...
to
get
into
some
entirely
different
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gross,
can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a...
a
basic
question
that
i
haven't
really
thought
through?
should
there
be
a
different
time
schedule
for
the
person
who
wants
to
operate
just
an
ordinary
bookstore
that
just
sells
textbooks
for
schools
and...
and
trade
books,
on
the
one
hand,
and
an
adult
bookstore
on
the
other
hand?
would
one
of
them
be
entitled
to
more
prompt
review
of
his
license
application
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
the
constitution
commands
more
prompt
treatment
of
an
application
by
an
adult
bookstore
than
by
an
ordinary
bookstore.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
to
confess
to
another
problem.
as
i
understand
part
of
your
argument,
you're
contending
you're
not
an
adult
bookstore,
an
adult
establishment,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
contending
you
don't
have
challenge...
standing
to
challenge
the
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
that's
because
you
decided
to
go
into
business
without
getting
a
license,
which
might
have
been
a
fairly
reckless
thing
to
do,
i
would
think.
