justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nathan,
i
gather
that
a...
i
gathered
from
your
brief
that
your...
your
principal
point,
or
at
least
a
principal
point
in
this
case,
is
your
contention
that
this
case
is
different
from
censorship
cases
where
the
judgment
is
left
to
a...
a
board
with...
with
no
standards
as
to
whether
a
particular
movie
can
be
shown
or
not.
there
immediate
review
is
necessary.
your
claim
here
is
that
the
matters
that
are
determined
by
the
administrative
organ
are
not
matters
of
censorship,
but
rather
quite
discernible,
physical,
and
practical
points.
what...
what
specifically
was
the
basis
for
turning
down
the...
the
license
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
well,
what...
what
would
have
been...
what
would
have
been
the
issues
if
the
application
had
been
filed?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
concede
that
the
second
freedman
requirement
demands
that
judicial
review...
or
that...
that
a
judicial
determination
be
concluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
that's
the
whole
issue
here,
whether
it's
enough
that
you
can
promptly
begin
a
suit
or
whether,
in
fact,
what...
what
freedman
requires
is
that
a
suit
has
to
be
raced
through
to
termination
in
these
cases.
justice
scalia
and
i
suppose
that
interpreting
the
second
requirement
that
way
does
prevent
the
administrative
agency
from
delaying
matters
by
simply
delaying
the
issuance
of
its
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
i
guess
we'd
have
to
have
either
a
statute,
such
as
the
statute
that
requires
federal
district
courts
to
expedite
criminal
cases.
i'm
not
sure
a
federal
district
court
can
both
take
the
case
and
also
bump
it
up
to
the
top
of
its
docket.
can
they
do
that,
leaving...
leaving
behind
people
who
have
been
waiting
several
years
to
be
heard?
i
don't
know
that
that
will
work
without
a
federal
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is
a
matter
of
sorting
them
to
the
extent
you
have
to
figure
out
what's
an
adult
business.
now,
you...
you
say
that
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
maybe
we
don't
decide
very
much
if
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
why
isn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
sorting
type
issue?
you
claim
you're
not
an
adult
business,
in
which
case
you're
not
even
subject
to
this
ordinance.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's...
it's
not
even
clear
that
the
legislature
can
do
it
in
some
states.
indeed,
you
know,
i...
i
think
there
are
limits
to
what
a
legislature
can
tell
a
court.
i
think
it
can't
tell
a
court
to
pump
out
a
decision
in
10
days.
you
think
it...
you
think
it
can
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
are
other
restrictions.
you...
i'm
sure
you
can't
open
it
in
the
middle
of
a
residential
neighborhood,
can
you?
justice
scalia
but
you
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--anywhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
zoning?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
not
just
an
adult
zoning.
i
assume
there's
a
commercial
zone.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so...
so
they
can't
open
it
anywhere.
they
have
to
go
through
a
procedure.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
a
special
licensing?
you
mean
there
are
special
zoning
requirements?
what
else
besides
special
zoning
requirements?
i
assume
there
are
special
zoning
requirements
for...
i
don't
know...
sulfur
factories
and...
and,
you
know,
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
slaughterhouses,
sure.
sure,
there
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
so
i
mean,
this
is
just
the
city
has
decided
that
it
doesn't...
and...
and
we
said
it's
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
city
to
say
that,
that...
that
we
don't
want
too
many
of
these
and
we
want
them
in
certain
areas.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
can
say
that
about
slaughterhouses.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
somebody
else
might
not
get
prompt
judicial
review
and
that's
enough
to
strike
down
the
ordinance.
right?
that's
what
the
facial
challenge
is
all
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
content
with
the
review
in
municipal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
whether
that...
that
helps
or
hurts
your
case.
what...
what
i
find
really
peculiar
is
that
if,
you
know,
some
homeowner
has
another
child,
need...
needs
to
put
in
a
new
bedroom
in
the
home,
that
person
has
to
go
through
the
normal
zoning
procedures
and
get...
you
know,
get...
get
approval
from
the...
from
the
electrician
licensing
board
and
everything
else
and
then
go
through
judicial
review.
likewise,
if
a
new
hospital
seeks
to
locate,
they...
they
have
to
go
through
zoning
and
all
the
other
approvals
and
then
through
normal
judicial
review.
and...
and
what
you're
arguing
is
that
somehow
adult
bookstores
are...
are
so
significant
to
the...
to
the
life
of
the
community,
because
of
the
first
amendment,
that...
that
we
have
to
give
them
special
treatment.
you
know,
i...
i
have
to
wait
2
years
before
i
can
put
in
my
bedroom,
but
the
adult
bookstore
goes
right
to
the
head
of
the
line.
that
seems
to
be
very
strange.
and
if...
if
that's
where
we've
arrived
at,
we...
we
ought
to
retrace
our
steps
perhaps.
