justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
if
there's
a
danger
of
delay
in
litigation
that...
that
both
parties
fear...
and
apparently
you
feared...
isn't
that
all
the
more
reason
that
before
you
have
a
license
which
restricts
the
publication
of
allegedly
lawful
speech,
that
you
should
have
a...
a
system
for
prompt
judicial
determination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i...
you
could...
if
we're
sitting
here
drafting
a
model
ordinance,
which
is
of
course
part
of
the
problem
that
i'm
presented
with
so
far
as
the
respondents
are
concerned,
but
if
you're...
if
we're
trying
to
envisage
a
model
ordinance,
just
account
for
that
contingency,
saying
our
prompt
judicial
determination
procedure
applies
only
if
there's
a
first
amendment
claim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
didn't...
would
have
every
incentive
to?
i
just
didn't
hear.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
suppose
that
if
we're
concerned,
as
i...
as
i
think
the
courts
are
concerned,
about
protecting
first
amendment
rights,
one
thing
we
could
do
is
just
say
that
if
there's
any
apparent
delay
in
determination,
the
united
states
district
courts
under
1983
are
free
to...
are
free
to
intervene
at
once.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
if
that
helps
you
or
if
it
helps
the
respondent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
that
i...
i
would
think
the
municipalities
and
the
states
would
raise
questions
about
deferring
to
the
state
courts
for
determination
of
state
law
issues
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
those
administrative
requirements
are...
are
mandated
under
the
constitution
when
first
amendment
issues
are...
are
present?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
would
you
go
that
step
unless
you're
being...
you
just
think
you're
forced
to
under
our
decision?
why
would
you
go
that
step
and...
but...
but
then
moot
the
whole
thing
out
by
having
a...
an...
a
protracted
judicial
process?
what...
what
sense
does
that
make?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
but
i...
i
asked
you
if...
if
you
concede
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
expedition
at
the
administrative
process...
at...
at
the
administrative
level,
it
then
seems
to
me
that
it
also
follows
there
has
to
be
one
at
the
judicial
level.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
concede
that
there
are
such
obligations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it...
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
just
much
simpler
for
us
to
acknowledge,
for
the
system
to
acknowledge
that
there's
a
strong
first
amendment
interest
here,
so
expedition
is
important,
rather
than
write
some
model
ordinance.
you
can
go
to
federal...
if...
if
the
state
isn't
complying
with
that
rule,
go
to
the
federal
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just
not
sure
why
that
isn't
adequate
if
a
federal
judge
thinks
that
the...
the
city...
that
the
state
system
is
delaying
matters
and
that
speech
is
at
risk,
the
federal
court
could
issue
an
injunction.
why
should
we
write
a
model
ordinance
up
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
this...
this
goes
maybe
over
the
same
ground,
but
let's
assume
that
in
the...
in
a
circuit
court
in...
in...
say,
in
the
tenth
circuit,
it's
recognized
that
licensing
restrictions
that
apply
and...
and
permit
requirements
that
apply
to
first
amendment
materials
are
most
sensitive.
and
the...
and
the
courts
of
the
circuit,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
are...
are
very
faithful
in...
in
implementing...
in
implementing
that
rule.
why
do
we
have
to
have
an
ordinance?
go
to
the
federal
court
and
say
speech
is
being
chilled,
speech
is
being
suppressed,
there's
unreasonable
delay.
the
court
says,
i
agree.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
end
of
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
the
whole...
no.
the
whole
premise
of
my
question...
maybe
you're
going
to
tell
me
it's
hypothetical.
the
whole
premise
is
the
federal
courts
are
open
to
hear
claims
of
unreasonable
delay
that...
that
chills
the
expression
of
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
what
you're
saying
that
there
is
a
reliance
interest
on
the
part
of
these
businesses?
they
should
know
that
there
is
a...
an
efficient
licensing
procedure
with
judicial
review
so
they
can
factor
into
their
costs
of...
of
doing
business
whether
or
not
they
can
afford,
say,
3
months
of
expedited
litigation
and
that
this
is
a...
a
first
amendment
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
the
states
know
that
the...
that
the
penalty
they
suffer
for
not
doing
that
is
having
to
submit
themselves
to
federal
court
litigation
where
the
federal
courts
really
sweep
abstention
aside
and
so
forth
because
of
the
urgency,
i
guess
that's
maybe
the
decision
that
states
should
make.
