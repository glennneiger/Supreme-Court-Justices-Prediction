justice
david
h.
souter
i
suppose
the
city
could
have
sought
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
the
business
until
it
got
the
license.
it
didn't
in
this
case,
i
take
it,
but
they
could
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
has...
has
anyone
suggested
that
your...
i
don't
know
the...
the
merits
of
this
separation
of
powers
problem
that
you
raise,
but
has
anyone
suggested
that
the
answer
to
that
may
simply
be
not
to
try
to
directly
control
the
courts
to
come
down
with
a
decision
after
x
days
or
weeks
or
whatnot,
but
simply
have
a
kind
of
circuit
breaker
provision
that
if
they
don't,
the
license
will
be
deemed
to
be
granted?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
could
be
provision.
it
could
be
permanent.
if...
if
the...
if
the
state
doesn't
want
to
move
fast,
you
would
get
the
license
in
the
meantime,
or...
or
perhaps
get
it
permanently.
but
that
would
avoid
separation
of
powers.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
we...
we
don't
know.
that's...
that's
the
whole
point.
we
don't
know
whether
the
applicant
is
qualified.
that's
why
you're
in
court.
and
the...
the
way,
in
effect,
i...
to...
it
seems
to
me
to
ensure
your
interest
is
simply
to...
to
have
an
encouragement
to
a
prompt
disposition.
and
if
the
machinery
of
the
state
cannot
somehow
pull
itself
together
to
give
the
prompt
disposition,
then
i
don't
know
what
you've
got
to
complain
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i'm
sure
the
state
courts
will,
but
i've
come
from
a
state
court
and
i...
i
know
what...
what
caseloads
are.
and
unless
there
is
an
inducement
to
move
quickly,
the...
the
state
courts,
you
know,
may
have
obligations
to
other
litigants
and...
and
not
move
as
fast
as
the...
as
the
first
amendment
would
call
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
in...
in
which
case
then,
if
there
were
this
kind
of
circuit
breaker
provision,
the...
the
courts
would...
would
have
every
procedural
basis
for
honoring
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
would
have
to
have
filed
its
appeal.
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
simply
have
your
circuit
breaker
saying
if
there's
going
to
be
an
appeal,
file
the
appeal
within
x
days.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
these
are
simply
things
that
states
can
provide
by...
by
law,
it
seems
to
me,
without
any
great
difficulty.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
if
you
take
the
position
that
in
fact
the
state
should
move
promptly
here,
what
is
the
state
going
to
lose
by,
in
effect,
a
fail-safe
requirement
that
it
must?
on
your
theory,
it's
not
going
to
be
doing
anything
more
than
it
ought
to
do
in
the
first
place.
so...
so
we
would...
we
would
be
providing,
on
your
theory,
for
the
outlier
case.
so
what
would
be
the...
what
would
be
the
reason
for
complaint
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
of
which
is
true
unless
the...
the
city
chooses
to
do,
as
it
did
not
do
here,
and
that
is
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
the
business
in
the
absence
of
the
license.
