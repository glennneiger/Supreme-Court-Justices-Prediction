chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
02-1609,
the
city
of
littleton
v.
z.j.
gifts.
mr.
nathan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
any
of
the
courts
which
have
said
that
prompt
disposition,
rather
than
just
access...
have
they
gone
on
to
say
that
prompt
appellate
disposition,
because
presumably
you
can
appeal
from
the
ruling
of...
of
a
superior
court
or
a
trial
court,
that
that
also
is
required?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
ordinarily,
even
if
you
get
a
prompt
disposition
in
the
trial
court,
you
can
wait,
you
know,
a
good
year
before
you
get
a
disposition
on
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
nathan.
mr.
cole,
well
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we've
also
held
that
federal
courts
are...
should
be
very
loathe
to
intervene
in
ongoing
state
proceedings.
wait
till
the
state
proceeding
is
over
and
then
you
can
go
to
federal
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
local
ordinance
provide
a
limit,
time
limit,
for
the
administrative
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is...
what
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cole.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gross,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
freedman
was
actual
censorship
and
this
is
not
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
the...
the
claims
of
the
owner
here
are
just
as
urgent
under
the
first
amendment
as
in
freedman?
because
certainly
pbs
suggested
they
weren't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
municipal...
a
municipality
in
most
states
can't
prescribe
the
procedures
in
a
state...
in
a
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
real
complaint...
your
real
complaint
is
we
granted
certiorari.
isn't
that
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but...
but
we're
not
talking
about
censorship.
i
mean,
we're
not
talking
about
a
licensor
who
says
you
can
sell
this
book
or
you
can't
sell
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
a...
when
you
talk
about
a
municipal
court,
do
you
mean
the
municipal
court,
say,
of
the
city
of
littleton
or
a
municipal
court
created
by
the
state
of
colorado?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the...
the
only
burden
is
as
to
location,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those...
those
really
don't
raise
first
amendment
concerns,
do
they,
the
fact
that
you
might
be
limited
in
your
hours,
you
couldn't
go
past
2:00
p.m....
2:00
a.m.?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gross.
mr.
nathan,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nathan.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1609,
the
city
of
littleton,
colorado
versus
z.j.
gifts
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
