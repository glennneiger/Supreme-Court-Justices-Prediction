mr.
douglas
r.
cole
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
neither
necessary
nor
appropriate
to
require
licensing
schemes
like
littleton's
to
provide
prompt
judicial
determination.
it's
not
necessary
because,
as
this
court's
cases
demonstrate,
the
type
of
judicial
review
required
in
licensing
schemes
must
be
correlated
to
the
first
amendment
concerns
that
the
ordinances
present.
the
first
amendment
risks
here
are
far
less
than
the
risks
of
freewheeling
censorship
that
were
at
issue
in
freedman
and
its
progeny.
the
ordinance
here
does
not
license
speech.
it
licenses
businesses.
thus,
prompt
access
is
sufficient.
in
fact,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
impose
a
judicial
deadline
requirement
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
it
would
impede
state
and
local
efforts
to
control
secondary
effects.
second,
it
would
offend
notions
of
comity
and
federalism
by
assuming
that
state
judges
will
ignore
their
constitutional
obligations
to
be
sensitive
to
the
first
amendment.
and
finally,
it
would
require
local
officials
to
impose
time
limits
on
those
over
whom
they
have
no
control.
excuse
me.
thus,
both
constitutionally
and
jurisprudentially,
prompt
access
to
meaningful
review
is
all
that
the
constitution
requires.
the
freedman
decision
was
motivated
by
two
concerns,
neither
of
which
is
present
here.
there's
neither
the...
the
problem
of
unbridled
discretion,
nor
a
risk
of
self-censorship.
unbridled
discretion
occurs
only
in
two
situations
where
you
have
either
the
possibility
of
administrative
delay
or
standardless
discretion.
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases,
the
latter,
standardless
discretion,
presents
unique
challenges
for
judicial
review.
it
makes
sense
in
that
context
to
require
some
type
of
judicial
deadline
because
essentially
meaningful
judicial
review
on
an
expedited
basis
is
impossible
if
there's
no
standard
to
give
any
indication
as
to
why
the
administrative
decision
was
made.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
and...
and,
your
honor,
if--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
1983
is,
of
course,
always
available
as
a
vehicle
for
someone
that's
asserting
that
their
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
abstention
doctrines,
younger
abstention,
for
instance,
might
come
to
play.
here
the
court...
or
i'm
sorry...
the
city
waived
any
abstention
argument
in
order
to
allow
the
1983
case
to
proceed.
potentially
it
could
have,
notwithstanding
the
abstention
argument,
but
of
course,
there
would
be
the
issue
of
abstention
which
is
one
reason
why
prompt
access
to
some
type
of
state
remedy
is
so
important
in...
in
the
case
if
1983
is
not
an
effective
vehicle.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
and
i
guess
at...
at
core,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
go
to
the
federal
court
under
1983
or
to
state
court.
presumably
the
sensitivity
of
the
judge
to
the
first
amendment
concerns
in
both
cases
would
be
the
same
and
their
willingness
to
move
it
to
the
front
of
the
docket
would
be
the
same.
we
look...
i
mean,
this
court
has
definitely
in
the
past
shown
that
where
state
courts
are
not
sufficiently
sensitive
to
first
amendment
concerns,
for
instance,
in
the
skokie
case,
the
court
demonstrated
that
it
could
fashion
tools
to
handle
what
it
felt
was
undue
delay
in
the
court
system.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
absolutely,
and
in
the
skokie
case,
it
came
up
through
the
state
court
system
and
directly
into
this
court
rather
than
via
a
district
court
model.
but...
but
the
point
is
as
long
as
you
have
prompt
access,
you're
going
to
get
access
to
a
judicial
official
who
is
going
to
be
sensitive
to
first
amendment
concerns
and,
if
necessary,
has
all
the
traditional
tools
of
equity
available
to
provide
immediate
relief,
tro's,
pi's.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
you
need...
under
state
systems,
most
state
systems
have
some
form
of
requirement
that...
that
the
court
knows
that
the
administrative
process
is
over
so
it
knows
it
doesn't
have
to
defer
to
the
administrative
process
anymore.
so
by
having
a
clear
exit,
as
well
as
a...
a
vehicle
that's
either
prescribed
by
rule
or
by
statute
so
everybody
knows
the
appropriate
vehicle
and
there
aren't
any
questions
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
hear
the
matter,
as
well
as
a
record
that...
that
they
can
use
to
make
a...
a
prompt
review
when
it
gets
before
them,
we
would
contend
that
that
meets
what
this
court
was
talking
about
with
respect
to
the
second
prong
in
fw/pbs.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i
believe,
as
it's
currently
drafted,
it
is
up
to
about
40
days,
but
it
could
be
even
quicker
than
that.
i
say
up
to.
there
are
certain
periods
of
time
within
which
the
applicant
can
act
within
the
next
10
days,
and
so
if
they
act
within
the
first
day,
then
that
would
shorten
the
time
frame
even
further.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
a
prompt
administrative
decision,
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that...
that
comes
from
fw/pbs,
as...
as
well
as
to
the...
i
mean,
fw/pbs's
interpretation
of
freedman
in
the
context
of
content-neutral
licensing
schemes.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
your
honor,
there's
been
no
showing
here
that
there
would
be
a
protracted
judicial
process.
the--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
your
honor,
the...
the
question
before
the
court
today,
though,
is
what
does
littleton's
or
a
town
like
littleton's
licensing
scheme
need
to
provide.
there
may
be
some
independent
constitutional
obligations
on
state
court
judges
to
act
promptly
with
respect
to
first
amendment
concerns,
but
the
question
is,
does
that
need
to
appear
in
the
text
of
littleton's
ordinance?
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i
concede
that...
that
courts
have
an
obligation
under
cases
like
skokie
to
be
sensitive
to
the
time
concerns
that
are
presented
by
first
amendment
issues.
i
don't
know
that
there's
any--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
city
ordinances.
the
california
statute,
which
was
passed
as
a
result
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
i
believe
allows
either
the
city
or
the
applicant
to
proceed
to
court,
whatever
the
licensing
decision
is.
either
the
tennessee
or
the...
i
believe
it's
the
california
one.
but...
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
city
ordinances
that
do
that.
the...
z.j.
gifts
relies
heavily
at
page
18
of
their
brief
on
a
quote
from
southeastern
that
says
a
free
society
prefers
to
punish
the
few
who
abuse
rights
of
speech
after
they
break
the
law
rather
than
throttle
them
and
all
others
beforehand.
to
me,
that
puts
a
real
point
on
the
difference
between
the
prior
restraints
that
were
at
issue
in
freedman
and
southeastern
and
cases
like
that
and
the
situation
here.
that
assumes
we
need
to
do
some
sort
of
sorting,
bad
speech
and
good
speech,
and
we
want
to
know
should
we
do
the
sorting
beforehand
or
after,
and
the
court
says,
not
surprisingly,
let's
them
talk
and
then
we'll
punish
the
ones
who
utter
things
that
are
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
here
there's
no
need
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
sorting.
any
adult
business
has
the
prospect
for
creating
the
secondary
effects
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
renton
and
young
and...
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
sorting
them.
it's
a
matter
of
if
you're
an
adult
business,
you
need
a
license
and
that
license
might
include
requirements
like
where
you
can
locate
within
the
city.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
but
if
you're
not
subject
to
this
ordinance,
you're
not
going
to
be
seeking
judicial
review
under
this
ordinance,
and
you'll
do
what...
what
z.j.
gifts
did
here,
which
is
bring
a
facial
challenge
under
the
first
amendment
before
you've
even
subjected
yourself
to
the
licensing
scheme.
one
would
assume
that
the
judicial
review
that
we
require
to
be
part
of
the
licensing
scheme
would
be
to
deal
with
those
cases
that
come
up
through
the
licensing
scheme
and
to
which
the
judicial
review
would
then
apply.
if
the...
if
the
question
is
it's
ex
ante,
does
it
even
apply
to
me,
that
will
be
litigated
in
a
different
forum
than
what
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
and
it...
if
they...
if
they
seek
to
enjoin
the
business
at
that
point,
then
you're
right.
they
could
raise
the
constitutional
defense
presumably
that
they
would
have.
and
at
that
point
then--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--thank
you,
your
honor.
