mr.
raphael
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
special
master
correctly
decided
the
regulation
issue
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
language
of
the
compacts
in
question
is
plain
and
unambiguous,
and
second,
for
more
than
180
years,
maryland
never
disputed
that
it
was
entirely--
mr.
raphael
--the
plain
language
of
article
iv
of
the
black-jenkins
award
uses
the
term
riparian
ownership.
mr.
raphael
it's
both.
mr.
raphael
that...
that's
correct.
but
we
think
that
the
plain
language--
mr.
raphael
--we
think
it's
both.
mr.
raphael
that's...
that's
correct
because
the
enabling
legislation
for
the
black-jenkins
award
provided
that
neither
of
the
states
would
be
deprived
of
any
of
the
rights
or
privileges,
nor
would
the
citizens
be
deprived
of
rights
or
privileges
that
they
had
under
the
compact
of
1785.
mr.
raphael
your
honor,
the
citizens
in
virginia
only
had
those
rights
under
the
compact
because
virginia
as
a
sovereign
entered
into
an
interstate
compact
with
maryland.
secondly,
maryland
recognized
in
the
enabling
legislation
that
provided
for
the
black-jenkins
award
that
the
rights
were
the
rights
not
only
of
citizens,
but
of
the
states.
that
language
is
used
in
the
enabling
act.
mr.
raphael
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
raphael
i
think
that's
correct.
if...
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
that
accompanied
the
black-jenkins
award,
the
arbitrators
said
that
virginia
had
proven
her
use
of
the
potomac
river
since
her
earliest
days
and
that
her
rights
were,
therefore,
indisputable
and
that
maryland
assented
to
virginia's
use
when
she
signed
the
compact
of
1785.
now,
that
compact,
your
honor,
was
entered
into
at
a
time
when
the
boundary
was
disputed,
and
regardless
of
where
the
boundary
was
set...
i
think
mr.
baida
admits
this...
it
was
recognized
that
that
compact
did
not
set
the
boundary,
but
each
state
agreed
that
wherever
the
boundary
ultimately
would
be
set,
the
citizens
of
each
state
and
the
states
themselves
would
have
certain
rights,
and
those
rights
included
the
right
to
property
in
the
shores,
and
all
advantages
and
emoluments
thereunto
belonging,
and
the
privilege
of
making
and
carrying
out
wharfs
and
other
improvements.
mr.
raphael
i
don't
think
that
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
article--
mr.
raphael
--yes.
mr.
raphael
well,
the
black-jenkins
award
clearly
deals
with
virginia
as
a
state.
the
compact
deals
with
virginia
as
a
state
in
article
viii,
for
example,
where
it
requires
that
neither
state
could
regulate
fishing
or
navigation
without
the
concurrence
of
the
other
state.
articles
x
and
xi
and
xii
also
deal
with
the
rights
of
the
citizens.
wherever
the
compact
involved
a
matter
in
which
a
state
would
touch
the
activities
of
the
citizens
of
the
other
state,
it
said
so
expressly.
and
it's
inconceivable
to
think
that
the...
the
drafters
of
the
compact
would
have
agreed
that
concurrent
legislation
would
be
required
for
fishing
and
navigation,
but
maryland
could
somehow
regulate
virginia's
right
to
build
improvements
from
the
shore.
it's
inconceivable
that
they
would
have
ratified
the
compact
if
that
had
been
required.
mr.
raphael
that's
correct,
your
honor.
article
viii
requires
concurrent
legislation
for
fishing
and
navigation
rules
in
the
potomac
river.
mr.
raphael
that's
correct.
mr.
raphael
your
honor,
until
1957,
the
states
had
concurrent
legislation
governing
fishing
in
the
potomac
river.
in
1957...
and
that
was
based
on
article
viii
of
the
compact.
in
1957,
maryland
attempted
to
abrogate
that
requirement
and
to
assume
unilateral
authority
over
the
potomac
river.
virginia
filed
suit
here.
this
court
appointed
a
special
master
to
hear
the
case.
the
states
resolved
their
dispute
as
to
the
tidal
potomac
with
the
creation
of
the
potomac
river
fisheries
commission,
which
is
a
bi-state
agency
that
now
regulates
fishing
in
the...
in
the
tidal
potomac.
as
to
the
non-tidal
potomac,
since
1957
each
state
has
had
laws
on
the
books
that
recognize
permits
issued
or
licenses
issued
to
citizens
of
the
other
state
as
valid
licenses
for
fishing
in
the
non-tidal
potomac.
mr.
raphael
the...
the
permit,
justice
o'connor,
was
issued
to
the
fairfax
county
water
authority.
mr.
raphael
no,
your
honor,
because
we
contend
that
no
permit
was
required
in
the
first
instance,
and
we
also
challenged
that
specific
permit
because
the
maryland
legislature
required
that
it
contain
a
condition
requiring
the
water
authority
to
put
a
flow
restrictor
into
the
pipeline
for
the
sole
purpose,
the
maryland
legislature
said,
of
allowing
maryland
to
control
growth
and
development
in
northern
virginia.
we
object
to
that.
the
authority
objected
to
that
subject
to
the
outcome
in
this
case.
we
object
to
any--
mr.
raphael
--that's
correct.
mr.
raphael
that's
correct.
and--
mr.
raphael
--that's
exactly
right,
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
my
answer
is
limited
to
just
the
fairfax
county
water
authority.
we
object
to
the
continuation
by
maryland
of
a
permit
system
that
requires
virginia
to
get
maryland's
permission
anytime
we
want
to
withdraw
water
from
the
potomac
river
or
build
improvements
appurtenant
to
the
shore.
mr.
raphael
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
a
riparian
right,
your
honor.
mr.
raphael
with
respect
to
the
potomac
river,
there's
a
low
flow
allocation
agreement
in
place
that
congress
required
which
allocates
the
flows
during
periods
of
low
flow.
there
is
a
water
coordination
agreement
of
1982
in
place
by
which
the
three
main
utilities
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
agreed
to
provide
for
a
future
water
supply.
this
court
said
in
colorado--
mr.
raphael
--no.
we
don't
believe
they
do
have
that
right.
mr.
raphael
not
under
the
low
flow
agreement
and
not
under
the
water
supply
coordination
agreement,
absolutely
not.
mr.
raphael
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
court
said
in
colorado
v.
new
mexico
that
before
this
court
will
enjoin
any
state
from
diverting
water
from
the
potomac
river,
the
state--
mr.
raphael
--i'm
sorry.
that
was
the
vermejo
river.
this
court
requires
a
showing
that
the
diversion
would
cause
clear...
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
diversion
would
cause
injury
to
the
state
seeking
to
prevent
the
diversion.
in
this
case,
maryland
has
circumvented
that
requirement
by
controlling
the
tap.
maryland
doesn't
contend
that
anything
virginia
has
done
to
date
injures
the
river.
mr.
raphael
there...
there
would
be
many
places
where
they
can
raise
that
issue
if
virginia
prevails
in
this
case.
they
can
raise
it
in
the
context
of
the
federal
and
virginia
permitting
requirements,
the
404
and
section
10
permitting
requirements.
mr.
raphael
if...
if
maryland
has
a
claim
that
virginia's
withdrawals
injure
it,
it
has
a
place
where
it
can
raise
that
claim.
mr.
raphael
it
could
be
here.
mr.
raphael
it
could
be
in
the
army
corps
of
engineers
permitting
process.
mr.
raphael
federal
common
law
would
govern
that,
as
this
court
said
in
colorado
v.
new
mexico.
the
fact
that
that
the
river
was
in
colorado
didn't
give
colorado
a
right
to
withdraw
water
from
that
river.
mr.
raphael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raphael
that's
correct.
they're
co-equal
sovereigns
contending
about
an
interstate
river
that
supplies
water
to
the
citizens
of...
of
both
states.
mr.
raphael
under...
under
our
view
of
the
case,
no,
because
the
compact
gave
that
citizen
the
right
to
do
it,
subject
to
federal
regulations,
subject
to
virginia
regulation.
and
maryland
can
contend
either
in
the
permitting
process
or
independently
that
any
action
by
a
virginia
citizen
that...
that
it
can
show
causes
injury
to
maryland
shouldn't
be
allowed.
but--
mr.
raphael
--the
master
ruled
that
under
the
compact
and
the
award,
virginia
and
its
citizens
have
the
right
to
withdraw
water
and
to
construct
improvements
appurtenant
to
the
shore
without
having
to
get
permission
from
maryland.
yes.
mr.
raphael
no,
your
honor.
the
primary
place
will
these...
where
these
disputes
will
be
decided
is
in
the...
as
a
practical
matter
is
in
the
federal
permitting
process.
it's
very
much
like
then-associate
justice
rehnquist
wrote
for
the
court
in
milwaukee
v.
illinois,
that
the
federal
permitting
process...
that
was
a...
a
federal
water
pollution
control
act
case...
that
the
federal
permitting
process
provides
an
adequate
forum
for
the
state
to
raise
concerns
that
it
has
about--
mr.
raphael
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
raphael
that's
correct.
mr.
raphael
i
think
the
key
evidence
of...
let
me
move
beyond
what
we
think
is...
is
the
plain
language
and...
and
discuss
also
what
the
master
looked
at
with
respect
to
maryland's
practice
historically.
the...
the
key
evidence
here
comes
from
1873.
this
is
at
a
time
when
maryland
and
virginia
were
trying
to
settle
their
boundary
dispute.
in
the
boundary
arbitration,
maryland
contended
that
the
boundary
line
should
be
on
the
virginia
side
at
the
low-water
mark
and
go
around
any
improvements
then
existing
or
which,
quote,
may
hereafter
be
extended
by
authority
of
virginia,
unquote.
that's
at
page
130
of
the
virginia
lodging.
in
the
maryland
view
in
1873
and
in
the
view
they
maintained
in
the
arbitration,
it
was
entirely
up
to
virginia
to
decide
when,
whether,
and
where
to
build
improvements
from
the
shore.
and
they
actually
thought
that
would
alter
the
boundary
line.
mr.
raphael
i
think,
your
honor,
all
of
the
court's
equitable
apportionment
cases
recognize
that
the
state
has
a
sovereign
interest
in
protecting
the
water
supply
of
its
citizens
where
that
water
supply
is
served
by
an
interstate
river.
mr.
raphael
most
of
the
cases--
mr.
raphael
--justice
kennedy,
most
of
the
cases
involve
a
river
which
goes
from
one
state
into
another
state,
and
we
don't--
mr.
raphael
--that's
right.
mr.
raphael
article
iv
of
the
black-jenkins--
mr.
raphael
--your
honor,
article
iv
of
the
black-jenkins
award
says
virginia
has
a
right
to
the
use
of
the
river
beyond
the
line
of
low-water
mark
as
being...
as
may
be
necessary
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
her
riparian
ownership.
and
maryland
stipulated--
mr.
raphael
--absolutely.
it
absolutely
does.
mr.
raphael
this
court's
federal
common
law
cases
that
distinguish
between
the
rights
of
states
with
respect
to
a
water
supply
and
the
rights
of
individual
citizens.
mr.
raphael
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
raphael
--colorado
v.
new
mexico
is
a
good
example.
the
pecos
river...
75
percent
of
it
came
from
colorado,
and
it
then
flowed
into
new
mexico.
but
this
court
effectively
denied
colorado
any
use
of
that
river
regardless
of
the
fact
that
she
owned
the
river.
ownership
is
not
dispositive
in...
in
a
dispute
between
states
over
a...
a
water
supply
that
supplies
the
citizens
of
both
states.
now,
the
potomac
river
is
an
interstate
river.
the
congress
recognized
that
in
1976
when
it
required
the
waters
to
be
allocated.
a
drop
of
water
that
begins
in
the
shenandoah
is
not
a
virginia
drop
of
water
anymore
than
it's
a
maryland
drop
of
water
when
it's
in
the
main
stem
of
the
potomac.
mr.
raphael
we
think
it's
at
least
coextensive
with
the
compact,
but
i...
i
don't...
i
think
that
that
position
would
be
defensible
but
it
does
go
beyond--
mr.
raphael
--your
honor,
those
words
give
maryland
a
right
of
action
and
a
cause
of
action
against
virginia
or
the
user
if
it...
if
the
use
interferes
with
maryland's
use
of
the
river.
that
doesn't
mean
maryland
gets
to
decide.
no
state
can
control
another
state's
access
to
the
water
supply
and
no
state
can
be
a
party
to
a
dispute
and...
and
then
fairly
decide
that
dispute.
mr.
raphael
no.
your
honor,
we
rely
on...
on
the...
the
plain
language
of
the
compact
and
the
black-jenkins
award
which
clearly
give
virginia
the
right
to
the
use
of
the--
mr.
raphael
--my
understanding
of
justice
kennedy's
question
was
whether
there's
a
distinction
between
riparian...
the
rights
of...
of
riparian
users
as
private
users
and
the
rights
of
states
as
riparians.
and
i
was
answering
that
question
that
yes,
there
is
a
difference,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said.
the
civil
law
as
between
riparian
users
does
not
bind
states
with
respect
to
their
use
of
an
interstate
stream.
that
was
the
question
i...
i
was
answering.
mr.
raphael
that's
correct.
mr.
raphael
it--
mr.
raphael
--virginia
has
the
right
to
regulate
its
citizens'
use
of
the
river,
and
it...
it
has
been
doing
that
for
many
years
through
the
local
building
permit
requirement
that
you
can't
build
a...
a
pier
or
a
wharf
on
the
virginia
side,
even
though
it
goes
beyond
low-water
mark,
without
getting
a...
a
building
permit
from
the...
from
the
county.
virginia
has
enacted--
mr.
raphael
--that's
correct.
and
virginia
has
enacted,
subject
to
the
resolution
of
this
case,
a...
the
virginia
water
permit
protection
requirement
applicable
to
virginia
users
of
the
river.
so
if...
if
virginia
prevails
in
this
case,
maryland
will
regulate
its
users
of
the
river
and
virginia
will
regulate
its
users
of
the
river.
mr.
raphael
he
would
get
that
authority
from
virginia.
mr.
raphael
the...
the
construction--
mr.
raphael
--your
honor--
mr.
raphael
--the
pier
is
appurtenant
to
property
on
the
virginia
shore,
and--
mr.
raphael
--that's
correct.
mr.
raphael
i
think
you
have...
we
distinguish
between
uses
that
are
riparian
and
uses
that
are
not
riparian.
99
percent
of
everything
that's
ever
been
built
there--
mr.
raphael
--that
would
be
a
riparian
use.
operating
a
casino
on
the
pier
would
not
be
a
riparian
use,
and
that's
why
virginia
has
not
objected
to
a
wide
variety
of
activities
by
maryland
on
its
side
of
the
line
that
don't
go
to
whether
virginia
has
the
right
to
build
the
riparian
structure
in
the
first
place.
mr.
raphael
article
vii
and
article
iv
of
the
black-jenkins
award.
mr.
raphael
that's
correct.
mr.
raphael
well,
there
may
be
uses
that
are
in
between
in
gray
as
to
whether
it's
a
riparian
use--
mr.
raphael
--let
me...
here's...
i'm
not
sure
how
the
question
would
be
answered,
but
let
me
tell
you
what
the
guiding
principles
would
be.
most
of
the
uses,
the
states
are
going
to
agree,
are
riparian
uses,
traditional
things,
bulkheads,
piers,
wharfs,
docks,
water
intakes,
as
the
master
found.
there
are
a
number
of
uses
that,
we'll
agree,
are
non-riparian.
building
a
casino
in
the
middle
of
the
river.
if
there's
a
gray
area
in
between
and...
and
we've
got
an
argument
that
it's
riparian
and
maryland
has
an
argument
it's
not,
that
issue
may
have
to
be
litigated
if
we
can't
resolve
it.
but
that's
the
framework
i
think
that
answers
these
questions.
now--
mr.
raphael
--that's...
that's
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg,
because
after
maryland...
after
the
boundary
was
set
on
the...
on
the
virginia
at
low-water
mark
in
1877,
virginia
doesn't
dispute
that
maryland
acquired
a
wide
range
of
police
powers
on
its
side
of
the
boundary,
but
that
specifically
did
not
apply
to
those
rights
that
virginia
and
its
citizens
enjoyed
under
the
compact
of
1785
and
which
were
preserved
as
a
condition
of
the
black-jenkins
award
and
which
maryland
historically,
at
least
until
1957,
recognized
was
entirely
up
to
virginia
to
decide
what
to
do
on
virginia's
shore.
mr.
raphael
your
honor,
there
are
something
like
340
piers
extending
from
the
virginia
side
of
the
potomac
river.
all...
all
of
them
are
taxed
by
the...
by
virginia.
only...
there
are
only
three
properties
that
are
taxed
by
maryland
and
those
are
unique.
they're
restaurant
properties
that
are
sited
on
property
that's...
the
fee
simple
title
to
which
is
recorded
in
maryland.
those
are
on
the
maryland
side
of
the
line.
so
virginia
taxes
99
percent
of
those
improvements.
maryland
argued
that...
that
you
should...
the
court
should
look
at
its
taxation
of
those
three
restaurant
properties.
we
think
that
that
is
the
exception
the
proves
the
rule.
maryland
doesn't
tax
99
percent
of
everything
that
virginia
has
ever
built.
the
maryland
construction
in
1873
that
it
was
entirely
up
to
virginia
to
decide
when
and
whether
and
where
to
build
improvements
remained
their
construction
until
at
the
earliest
1957.
and
it
was
in
1957
when
the
first
permit
was
issued
to
a
virginia
user
that
was
fairfax
county,
but
the
record
is
undisputed
that
that
permit
was
not
known
to
virginia
state
officials.
mr.
raphael
it
refers
to
the
advantages
and
emoluments.
mr.
raphael
right.
the
article
vii
refers
to
the
advantages
and
emoluments
of
the
ownership
of
land.
mr.
raphael
that's...
that's
exactly
right.
but
the
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
no
need
in
article
vii
to
address
that
specific
question
because
it
was...
everybody
would
have
assumed
that
each
state
retained
the
authority
to
regulate
its
own
citizens.
mr.
raphael
but,
your
honor,
it's...
to
our
thinking
it
would
be
inconceivable
that
george
mason
who...
who
negotiated
that
compact
on
behalf
of
virginia,
who
opposed
the
federal
constitution
because
it
gave
congress
too
much
authority
over...
over
commerce,
that
he
would
have
signed
an
agreement
with
the
understanding
that
maryland
had
the
authority
to
decide
when
and
where
virginia
could
make
use
of
the
river.
mr.
raphael
that's...
but
history
is
the
other
way.
that's
maryland's
argument,
is
that
it
always
had
every
stick
in
the
bundle
of
sticks,
but
historically
that's
not
the
case
because
there
were
prior
and
subsequent
grants
to
virginia
which
included
the
potomac
river.
five
monarchs
disputed
maryland's
claim.
and
the
issue
was
in
controverse,
as
this
court
has
twice
said
in
morris
v.
united
states
and
marine
railway,
and
they
agreed
in
1785
that
the
bundle
of
sticks
was
over
here
and
the
two
states
agreed
that
regardless
of
where
the
boundary
would
be
set,
each
state
would
have
equal
sticks
from
that
bundle
representing
the
right
of
equal
access
to
the
river,
and
they
further
agreed
that
as
a
condition
of
the
award,
those
sticks
in
that
bundle
would
never
be
deprived
of
either
state.
and
if
maryland
didn't
have
the
authority
to
take
away
or
regulate
virginia's
rights
prior
to
1877,
they
could
not
have
gained
that
authority
by
the
black-jenkins
award.
mr.
raphael
part
of
that
question,
your
honor,
goes
to
the...
goes
to
whether
the
boundary
is
at
the
historic
low-water
mark
or
at
the
mean
low-water
mark.
mr.
raphael
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
answered
that
question,
and
that
may
require
resolution
in
the
future.
but--
mr.
raphael
--this
court
determined
in
ohio
v.
kentucky
what
the
low-water
mark
was
as
of
1792.
mr.
raphael
again,
i
think
it's
going
to
depend
on
whether
it's
the
historic
low
or
the
mean
low,
and
if...
you
have
to
answer
that
question
before
i
think
you
can
answer
the
question.
mr.
raphael
and
as
long
as
it
doesn't
interfere
with
maryland's
use,
and
once
it
does,
maryland
has
a
remedy.
it
can
object
in
the
permitting
process.
it
can
file
an
original
action.
it
could
sue
the
virginia
user
making
use
of
that
water.
the
issue,
though,
is
whether
maryland
gets
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
what
virginia's
rights
are,
and
this
court
has
never
given
one
state
the
authority
to
control
another
state's
water
supply.
mr.
raphael
that's
right.
mr.
raphael
it
is
true
here.
virginians
can
withdraw
water
subject
to
paramount
federal
control
and
subject
to
virginia's
control.
mr.
raphael
they
can
withdraw
water
subject
to
virginia's
control.
mr.
raphael
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases,
including
new
york...
new
jersey
v.
new
york,
connecticut
v.
massachusetts,
that
a
common
law
limitation
that
may
limit
it
to
the
shoreline
use
of
the
riparian
use
would
not
apply
as
between
states.
and
article
vii
of
the...
article
iv
of
the
black-jenkins
award
refers
to
virginia's
rights
as
a
sovereign
to
the
use
of
the
potomac.
mr.
raphael
well--
mr.
raphael
--it
doesn't
use
the
word
sovereign,
but
i
don't...
i
fail
to
see
the
distinction--
mr.
raphael
--because
both
in
the
award
and
in
the...
in
the
opinion,
the
arbitrators
were
talking
about
virginia
as
a
commonwealth,
as
a
state,
not...
not
virginia
as...
as
a
mere
property
owner.
mr.
raphael
well,
the
issue
of
withdrawing
water,
whether
that's
a
riparian
use,
has
been...
has
been
stipulated.
the
master
said
at
page
12
of
his
report
that
maryland
never
disputed
that
this
was
a
riparian
use
or
a
use
covered
by
the
compact.
so
that's
not
an
issue.
mr.
raphael
that's
correct.
mr.
raphael
i...
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
i'd
like
to
correct
one
misstatement
i
think
my
friend,
mr.
baida,
made
with
respect
to
the
low
flow
allocation
agreement.
that
agreement
and
the...
the
enabling
legislation
that
provided
for
it
was
amended
to
make
clear
that
maryland
did
not
have
the
authority
to
control
virginia's
withdrawals.
that
issue
was
put
aside
to
another
day,
and
the
low
flow
allocation
agreement,
for
example,
says
that
no
party
can
withdraw
water
from
the
potomac
river
without
being
subject
to
a
permit
which
imposes
the
low
flow
conditions
or
becoming
a
member
party
to
the
agreement.
and
we
point
out
in
our
papers
the
numerous
instances
in
the
1970's
where
virginia
went
on
record
saying
maryland
did
not
have
the
authority
to
regulate
virginia's
water
withdrawals.
whether
you
look
at
this
case
under
the...
under
the
compacts
in
question
or
under
the...
under
federal
common
law,
you
cannot
give
one
state
the
authority
to
control
another
state's
water
supply.
this
case
is
important
not
only
because
of
virginia's
rights
to
build
wharfs
and
improvements.
it's
important
because
if
maryland
prevails,
they
can
control
growth
and
development
in...
in
virginia.
under
mr.
baida's
theory,
as
long
as
they
treat
everybody
equally,
they
can
do
anything
they
want,
and
that
would
include
things
like
in
2001
when
there
was
legislation
before
the
maryland
general
assembly
that
would
have
made
users
of
the...
of
the
waters
pay
for
water
withdrawal.
maryland
could
decide
that
it
doesn't
like
growth
and
development
on
either
side
of
the
river,
and
therefore
it's
treating
each
state
equally
by
not
allowing
any
use.
it's
impossible
to
square
that
type
of
position
with
the
plain
language
of
article
iv
of
the
award
or
article
vii
of
the
compact.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
