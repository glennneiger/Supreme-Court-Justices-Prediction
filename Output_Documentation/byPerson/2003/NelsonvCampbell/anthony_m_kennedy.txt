justice
kennedy
he...
he
didn't...
he
didn't
know
before
that
that...
that
this
was--
justice
kennedy
--the
procedure
they
were
going
to
use?
justice
kennedy
did...
did
you
at
any
point
shape
your
claim
for
relief
in
the
alternative,
saying
we
want
either
habeas
corpus
or
1983?
or
do
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
almost
everybody
agrees
it
has
to
be
1983?
justice
kennedy
is
that...
is
that
correct?
if...
if
we
had
to
do
this
in
a
circuit
with
no
precedents,
could
you
argue
that
this
would
be...
could
be
habeas?
it's
not
successive
because
it's...
the
issue
hasn't
come
up
before?
justice
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that's
assuming
it's
successive.
justice
kennedy
because
ripeness
could
be
a
merely
evidentiary
matter,
whereas
in
this
case,
you
did
not
have
a
claim
that
you
could
bring--
justice
kennedy
--at
the
time.
so
this
is
more
than
just
ripeness.
justice
kennedy
but
that
sounds
to
me
more
like
the
mode
of
execution
with
the...
with
the
drugs
that
you
said
was
distinguishable.
justice
kennedy
and
do
you
represent
he
can
get
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
his
arguments
in
one
of
those
procedures?
justice
kennedy
so
that
there
could
be
a
factual
hearing
on...
on
the
necessity
of
the...
and
the...
and
the
medical
propriety
of
these
procedures?
