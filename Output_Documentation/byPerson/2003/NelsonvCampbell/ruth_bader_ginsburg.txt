justice
ginsburg
was
it
that...
before,
mr.
stevenson,
you
said
that
nothing
that
the
prisoner
requests,
once
the
date
of
execution
is
set,
is
actionable
in
1983.
but
i
thought
that
the
eleventh
circuit
made
a
distinction
between
a
proceeding
that
would
require
a
stay
of
the
execution.
if
he
says
that
prior
to
the
execution
i'm
in...
in
a
dark,
dank
cell,
that
would
be
actionable
so
long
as
he's
not
seeking
to
postpone
the
date
of
the
execution,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
ginsburg
would
you
say...
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
his
complaint
was
not
this
inch
cut
but
the
combination
of
chemicals?
justice
ginsburg
but
he
did...
he
did
want
more
than
a
doctor.
he
didn't
want
this
procedure
to
be
used
when
there
was
an
alternate
procedure
that
would
be
safer,
less
painful?
justice
ginsburg
are
you
sure,
mr.
newsom--
--mr.
newsom,
can
i
ask
you
a...
a
hypothetical
question?
because...
assume
there's
merit
on
the...
to
the...
assume...
assume
you
have
a
case
in
which
a
week
before
the
election...
the
execution
the
state
tells
the
inmate
that
they're
going
to
hang
him
up
by
his
thumbs
and
beat
him
with
whips
until
he
dies.
and
he
never
expected
that.
what
is
his
remedy
in
the...
in
your
circuit
and
in
alabama
for
trying
to
stop
that?
justice
ginsburg
but
you...
you
said
if
this
happened
today,
that
rule
32
procedure
would
not
be
available.
justice
ginsburg
can
he...
can
he
get
a
stay?
well,
i'm
not
really
so
much
interested
in
the
state
remedy.
i
assume
that
an
alabama
judge
says
it
was
a
terrible
crime,
he
deserves
that
punishment.
and
now
what
does
he...
can
he
get
into
federal
court?
justice
ginsburg
gomez
was
10
years
and
a
claim
that
could
have
been
brought
much
earlier.
as
was
just
explained
to
us,
this
claim
could
not
have
been
brought
until
6
days
before
the
scheduled
date
of
execution
because
it
was
only
at
that
point
that
he...
that
he
knew
about
this.
so
i
don't
think
that
gomez--
but
i
did
want
to
ask
you
something
you
said
that
seemed
to
me
inconsistent
with
what...
what
mr.
stevenson
told
us.
you
said
that
it
was
only
the...
they...
they
agreed
on
what
would
be
the
first
steps
and
that
incorporated
the
percutaneous.
i
thought
we
were
told
by
mr.
stevenson
that,
no,
everybody
agreed
on
what
the
first
procedure
would
be,
but
you
then
went
immediately
to
the
cut-down
and
they
didn't.
there
was
an
intermediate
step
that
you
don't
have
in
your
protocol
that
they
said
would
have
been
more
respectful
of
this
man's
right
to
have
a
painless
death.
justice
ginsburg
but
was
there...
whatever
labels
you
use,
was
there
something
else
that
they
asked
for
that
you
were
not
willing
to
give?
justice
ginsburg
yes.
i
thought
i
understood
from
the
briefs
that
there
was
the
first
step.
everybody
agreed
if
could
do
it
that
way,
it
would
be
okay.
and
then
there
was
something
else
that
the
defendant
said
should
have
been
done
before
you
would
ever
get
to
the
cut-down,
and
if
you
got
to
the
cut-down,
certainly
you'd
want
to
have
proper
medical
personnel
there
to
administer
it.
justice
ginsburg
i'll
ask
mr.
stevenson
to
clarify
that.
justice
ginsburg
but
this
is...
you
made
the
point
earlier
that
if
this
man
were
just
in
his
cell
and
under
a
term
of
years,
that
this
would
be
an
entirely
proper
1983
case.
that's
not
the
same
for
somebody
who's
says
i'm
innocent
of
the
death
penalty.
that...
that
one...
you
can
say,
oh,
yes,
that's
habeas
and
nothing
else.
here,
you've
already
said
exactly
what
they're
doing
to
him,
if
they
had
done
it
in
order
to
get
access
to
his
vein
for
some
other
procedure
while
he's
incarcerated,
it
would
be
a
good,
plain
1983
claim.
but
somehow
when
it
gets
to
be
connected
with
how
he's
going
to
die,
it's
no
longer
a
1983.
justice
ginsburg
but
if
we...
we're
doing
1983,
then
there's
no...
there's
no
exhaustion
requirement.
there's--
justice
ginsburg
--but
you've
said
it
is
a
good
1983
claim
except
if
it...
if
it
is
in
relation
to
the
administration
of
the
death
sentence.
