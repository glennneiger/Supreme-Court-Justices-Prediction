justice
souter
may...
may
i
get
clear
on
one
thing?
justice
souter
did
he...
did
his
counsel
say
to
the
court,
the
district
court,
we
want
under
1983
an
order
that
says
admit
this
man's
doctor
to
the
place
of
execution
at
the
time
the
state
chooses
so
he
can
find
a
way
then
and
there
to
allow
the
state
to
carry
out
the
execution
when
it
wants
to
do
it?
did
he
ask
for
that?
justice
souter
is
that
what
he
was
asking
for
when
he
went
into
court?
justice
souter
was
it
made
clear
to
the
district
court
that
he
would
be
satisfied
with
the
order
i
have
just
described?
justice
souter
would
it
have
been
sufficient
to
say,
don't...
postpone
it
until
you
admit
the
doctor
to
be
present
and
get
the
catheter
in?
justice
souter
but
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
do
you?
justice
souter
on
the...
on
your
first
point,
are
you
going
to
address
directly
whether
this
is
second
or
successive?
justice
souter
he
says
it's
not.
justice
souter
well,
it
wasn't
raised
because
he
brought
1983.
but,
i
mean,
as
i
understand
the...
the
application
of
the
alabama
rule,
1983
was
ruled
out
because
this
either
should
have
been
brought
in
habeas
or
if
it
had
been
brought
in
habeas,
it
would
have
been
barred
under
aedpa,
and
it
would
have
been
barred
under
aedpa,
because
it
was
second
or
successive.
so
i
think
regardless
of...
of
how
we
analyze
it,
we've
got
to
get
to
that
point.
justice
souter
well,
isn't
that
a
possibility?
in
other
words,
one
of
the
things
we've
got
to
do
is...
is
give
effect
to
the...
to
the
aedpa
text.
we
can
give
effect
to
the...
i'm
not
saying
that
we
should
read
it
this
way,
but
we
could
give
effect
to
the
aedpa
text
if
we
say
that
regardless
of
whether
a
claim
was
ripe
or
not
as
a
factual
matter,
so
long
as
there
is
new
evidence,
whatever
new
means,
the
evidence
is...
is
not
going
to
entitle
him
to
relief
unless
it
satisfies
the...
the
innocence
prong
at
the
end
of
the
test.
we
could
say
that
and
at
the
same
time
say,
all
right,
that's
how
we
give
effect
to
aedpa.
but
if
there
is
something
more
than
ripeness,
which
makes
the
difference
between
bringing
the
claim
and
not
bringing
the
claim,
then
that
goes
to
whether
we
should
regard
it
as
second
or
successive.
there
is
something
more
here
because
this
is
a
claim
which
simply
did
not
arise.
he
could
not
have
pleaded
this
claim
at
any
point
prior
to
the
conclusion
of...
of
his
habeas,
and
for
that
reason,
we
should
interpret
second
or
successive
as
not
barring
this
because
otherwise
we
would
have
a
universe
of
claims,
assuming
they
are
proper
habeas
claims,
that
could
never
be
brought
even
though
they
state
a
constitutional
claim.
justice
souter
but
that's...
that's
fine,
but
i
mean,
that's
a
conclusory
statement:
for
whatever
reason.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
this
is
a
good
reason
to
say
that
the
term,
second
or
successive,
does
have
some
limiting
effect.
justice
souter
except
that
to...
in
order
to
make
that
point,
you
have
to
assume
that
congress
was
adverting
to
this
problem,
and
you
have
to
assume
that
the
words,
second
and
successive,
could...
could
simply
have
been...
or
the
word
subsequent
could
have
been
inserted
in
place
of
second
or
successive,
which
in
fact
is...
is
a
set
of
phrases
that...
that
are
terms
of
art.
justice
souter
so
i
think...
i
think
the
argument
is
a
stretch.
justice
souter
it
doesn't
necessarily
incorporate
the
old
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
allude
to
a
body
of
law
by
which
we
made...
because
there
was
no
other
law
involved,
we
had
to
draw
conclusions
as
to
whether
it
was
appropriate
or
not
appropriate
to
bar
this
claim.
that's
the
kind
of
art
that
those
words
plug
into.
if
they
did
want
to
plug
into
that,
all
they
had
to
use
was
a
neutral
word
like
subsequent.
justice
souter
convince
the
others.
[laughter]
justice
souter
you
were
going
to...
you
were
going
to
tell
us
that,
you
know,
the
sky
is
going
to
fall
if
we
find
that
this
is
1983.
justice
souter
well,
but...
but
is
it?
i
mean,
you...
you
said
without
venous
access,
there...
there
is
no...
there's
no
execution
by
lethal
injection.
but
there
is
execution
by
lethal
injection
without
cut-down.
and...
and
the
question
in
each
case
is
is
the
cut-down
gratuitous.
calling
the
cut-down
gratuitous
for
purposes
of
injection
does
not
challenge
the
legality
of
injection.
justice
souter
what
you're
doing
is
asking
all
the
courts,
including
this
one,
to
ignore
the
very
issue
and
simply
say,
in
effect,
under
aedpa
we
don't
care.
i
mean,
we're
somewhere
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea
here,
and...
and
i
would
suppose
there...
there
ought
to
be
a
middle
ground.
justice
souter
that's
i
thought
is
what
he
wanted
reviewed.
he
wants
to
be
able
to
litigate
the
necessity
of
this.
he
claims
that
it
is
gratuitous.
that's
his
point.
justice
souter
there
is
no
appropriate
forum
because
the
appropriate
forum
was
closed
to
him
before
you
announced,
a,
that
you
were
going
to
execute
him
by
injection
and,
b,
that
you
were
going
to
use
this
procedure
as
a
last
resort.
justice
souter
but...
but
if
he
does
and
loses,
his
only
access
to
the
federal
courts
is
by
a
petition
for
an
original
writ
here.
