mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
6
days
before
petitioner's
scheduled
execution
in
this
case,
an
execution
that
he
had
sought
and
informally
requested
be...
be
carried
out
as
soon
as
possible,
prison
officials
went
to
him
and
for
the
first
time
told
him
that
to
deal
with
a
medical
problem
that
both
parties
acknowledged
exists,
he
would
be
subjected
to
a
procedure
that
would
be
conducted
by
state
officials,
not
necessarily
medically
trained,
not
necessarily
licensed,
where
they
were
going
to
make
a
2-inch
incision
in
his
arm,
cut
through
fat
and
tissue
and
muscle,
until
they
had
a
vein
that
they
could
access
for
the
purposes
of
inserting
a
catheter.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
absolutely,
your...
your
honor.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
absolutely,
and
as
soon
as
he--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
your
honor,
and
he
did.
he
immediately
began
contacting
the
warden
at
holman
prison.
he
was
housed
in
another
facility
some
200
miles
away.
he
immediately
began
contacting
the
warden
at
holman
prison,
who
had
just
been
installed,
who
did
not
know
him,
and
informed
him
he
had
this
condition,
that
they
would
need
to
create
protocols
necessary
to
deal
with
it.
the
state
admitted
that
they
had
never
dealt
with
someone
in
this
condition
before
and
began
offering
all
kinds
of
things
that
would
accomplish
this
execution.
let
him
bring
in
a
physician
that
can
insert
a
catheter.
let's
get
some
protocols
established
so
that
we
don't
have
any
problems.
and
for
6
weeks
essentially
this
effort
was
being
made.
he
had
been
previously
told
that
they
were
going
to
do
this
24
hours
in
advance,
that
they
weren't
going
to
make
this
kind
of
2-inch
incision,
and
even
though
he
hadn't
been
assured
there
would
be
medical
people,
he
was
relatively
comfortable
with
that.
he
did
not
file
suit.
it's
only
6
days
before
for
the
first
time
that
the
state
announced
they
would
have
this
kind
of
invasive
procedure
carried
out
by
someone
who
was
not
necessarily
medically
trained.
he
filed
a
1983
action.
i
think
it's
important
for
this
court's
judgment
here
today.
the
district
court
found
that
that
1983
action,
if
it
went
in
mr.
nelson's
favor,
would
not
invalidate
his
judgment
or
conviction.
notwithstanding
that
conclusion,
the
district
court
felt
compelled
to
apply
a
rule
in
force
in
the
eleventh
circuit
that
effectively
shields
death
row
prisoners
facing
an
execution
from
doing
anything
that
can
challenge
unconstitutional
conditions
of...
of
confinement.
the
eleventh
circuit
rule
is
essentially
once
you
are
scheduled
for
an
execution,
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
prison
begins
to
do
something
and
amount
to
something
that...
that
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes,
and...
and
i...
i
guess
that's
our--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
and
your
honor,
i...
i
guess
our
position
is...
is
that
this
action
is
like
the
action
that
you
describe.
he
is
challenging
medical
treatment,
medical
procedures.
he
doesn't
say
he
doesn't
want
to
be
executed.
he's
not
trying
to
block
his
execution.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no.
i
think
the
effect
here
was
to
facilitate
the
execution.
mr.
nelson
went
into
court
saying,
let's
just
get
an
order
so
that
my
doctor
can
come
in
and
carry
this
out.
let's
just
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
on
the
2-inch
incision
which
makes
no
sense.
the...
the
court...
the
district
court
judge
says,
can't
you
lawyers
work
this
out?
mr.
nelson's
counsel
was
ready
then
and
there
to
effectuate
a
procedure
that
would
carry
out
this
execution.
and
the
eleventh
circuit
judgment,
justice
scalia,
is
actually
one
that
says
once
the
petitioner
is
scheduled
for
an
execution,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
conditions
of
confinement
suit
as
you
described,
that
the
federal
courts
somehow
have
no
authority
to
grant
relief
or
conduct
review
because
the
execution...
the
scheduling
of
the
execution
somehow
divests
those
courts
of
jurisdiction.
that's
the
eleventh
circuit
rule.
they
didn't
argue
here
that
because
his
litigation,
because
his
lawsuit
is,
in
effect,
an
attempt
to
bar
the
execution,
he
loses.
that's
the
distinction.
what
they
said
here
is
that
because
he
is
already
scheduled
for
execution,
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
conditions
of
the
confinement
are,
whether
it
invalidates
the
conviction
and
sentence.
federal
courts
have
no
authority
to
grant
relief.
and
that's
the
rule
we
urge
this
court
to
overturn.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes,
sir.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
what
he
asked
for...
what...
what
he...
what
he
put
in
his
complaint
was
that
he
had
made
that
offer
to
the
state,
and
that
was
in
his
complaint,
that...
that
the
defendant's
counsel
had
authorized
or
requested
the
opportunity
to
bring
in
a
physician
to
facilitate
a
review--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
what
he
was
asking
for
is
an
injunction
barring
them
from
doing
this
kind
of
2-inch
incision,
but
yes,
he
made
it
very
clear
in
the
complaint--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--only
to
the
extent...
yes,
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
when
the
district
court
said,
can't
you
work
this
out,
mr.
nelson's
counsel
said,
yes,
i
think
we
can.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
he
did,
your
honor.
he
did,
and
that
was
in
part
because
the
state
was,
at
least
at
the
point
at
which
this
lawsuit
was
filed
in,
saying
that
this
is
what
they
were
going
to
do
in...
in
the
absence
of
some
kind
of
federal
intervention.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i...
i
think
the
district
court
could
have
basically
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order.
you
are
enjoined
from
doing
this
kind
of
conduct
because
it
violates
contemporary
standards
of
medical
decency.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i...
i
think
it
could
have
been
sufficient
to
say
i'm
going
to
order
that
his
physician
be
admitted
into
the
facility.
i'm
going
to
order
that
you
accomplish
this
through
the
method
proposed
by
petitioner's
counsel.
i
think
all
of
those
things
could
have
been
done,
but
the
district
court
here
felt
like
he
did
not
have
the
authority
to
actually
deal
with
this
in
the
1983
context.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
and
i
guess
here,
your
honor,
what
we
think
is
that
when
the
prison
waits
until
6
days
before
the
scheduled
execution...
a
complaint
can
only
be
filed
3
days
before
the
scheduled
execution...
a
determination
of
whether
what
the
prison
is
proposing
is
unconstitutional
or
not
cannot
ordinarily--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no,
your...
he
had
been
told
before
that
they
were
going
to
do
something
24
hours
in
advance.
it
was
only
on
the
friday
before
the
thursday--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
yes,
that's...
he
was
told
for
the
first
time
on
that
friday,
2-inch
incision
in
the
arm,
not
necessarily
done
by
someone
medically
trained.
that
presented
a
very
different
kind
of--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--absolutely.
and...
and
the
record
reflects
that
there
were
repeated
efforts
on
the
part
of
mr.
nelson's
counsel
to
get
the
state
to...
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
the
conviction
was
1978.
the
death
sentence
is
1994.
he
spent
a
lot
of
years
on
death
row
under
an
illegal
death
sentence
that
the
eleventh
circuit
overturned
in
1993.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
in
1978.
the
death
sentenced
imposed
here
was
committed
in
1994,
and
it's
worth
noting
that
even
then
mr.
nelson
was
very,
very
sort
of
unsure
about
fighting
a
death
sentence.
he
told
the
judge
he
wanted
a
death
sentence.
no
appeal
briefs
were
filed
into
the
alabama
appellate
courts.
the--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
no,
it
was
not
styled
as
a
habeas
action,
in
part
because
the
eleventh
circuit
rules
would
have
prevented
us
from
ever
getting
review
in
this
court
or
any
other
court
if
it
had
been
framed
in
that
way.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
yes.
there...
there
certainly...
it's
certainly
true
that
other
circuits,
justice
kennedy,
apply
this
court's
doctrine
in
stewart
v.
martinez
where
a
claim,
an
execution
claim,
not
previously
ripe,
can
be
subject
to
habeas
review.
the
eleventh
circuit
doesn't.
their
position
expressed
in
in
re
medina
is
that
if
it
wasn't
in
your
first
habeas,
it
can't
be
presented.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
and
that's
why
we...
we--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
absolutely.
it's...
it's
certainly
conclusive,
justice
scalia.
it
could
not
be--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's
right.
that's
right.
it
certainly
would
not
be
a
successive
petition.
what
we
would
be
arguing
is
what
this
court
has
already
held,
that
an
unripe
execution
claim
of
this
sort,
of
a
competency
to
be
executed
claim,
which
this
court
held
in
stewart
was
cognizable
would
be
proper.
in
the
eleventh
circuit
that's
not
possible.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
we
do
not.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
absolutely.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
absolutely.
and...
and,
justice
souter,
i
think
you're
absolutely
right.
here,
where
you're
not
trying
to
do
something
that
invalidates
a
conviction
and
sentence,
it's
not
arguably
appropriate
to
be
thinking
about
this
in
the
habeas
context.
2241(c)
says
that
to
grant
habeas
relief,
the
petitioner
has
to
allege
that
the
conviction
and
sentence
is
illegal,
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
that's
not
mr.
nelson's
contention
here.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
much...
a
much
harder
question
because
that
does,
it
seems
to
me,
get
closer
to
the
execution.
what's
analogous
to
our
claim
is
a
claim
where
the
prison
says
a
week
before
the
execution
that
we're
going
to
and
effectively
shackle
you
to
a
hitching
post
and
not
give
you
any
food
for
72
hours.
we
contend
that
that
kind
of
treatment
would
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
what
we'd
be
trying
to
block
is
that
treatment,
not
the
execution.
the
reality
is
in
this
case--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i
think
the
primary
difference,
justice
scalia,
is
that
those
are
a
method
of
execution
cases.
they
are
challenging
the
method
of
execution.
here
we
have
a
procedure
that
is
not
even
unique
to
executions.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
but--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
venous
access
can--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
it's...
it's--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
guess--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--it's
not
clear,
your
honor,
that
in
all
of
those
cases
that
they
are
saying
if
you
want
to
use
a
different
drug,
that's
okay.
i
think
that
that's
one
distinction.
i
think
the
second
distinction
is
that
an
order...
particularly
in
states
that
have
statutes
dictating
which
chemicals
can
be
used,
in
those
cases
it
may
be
easier
for
a
court
to
find
that
an
order
in
that
case
does
invalidate
the
sentence.
here
we
have
a
completely
severable
procedure.
we
have
something
that
is
not
in
any
required
by
the
execution.
and...
and
the
state
is
saying
we
want
to
do
it
this
way,
and
there
are
100
other
ways
that
it
can
be
done.
and
in
fact,
it's
just
the
discretionary
conduct
of
the
state
prison
officials
that
puts
us
in
this
situation.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no,
your
honor,
and
it
wasn't
even...
he
wasn't
even
insisting
on
that.
he
was
prepared
to
have
their
doctor
come
in.
he
was
promised
a
doctor
when
he
got
to
the
prison.
he
never
saw
one.
there
was
never
a
physical...
never
a
doctor
to
examine
him.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no,
no,
your
honor.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
there
was...
he
wasn't
insisting
on
this
being
carried
out
in
one
way.
there
were
dozens
of...
of
offers
of...
of
carrying
this
out,
including
being
executed
by
electrocution,
something
else
that
the
state
rejected
as...
as
an
option
for
him.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
it's
our
position
that
this
procedure
is
unconstitutional.
it
does
not
comport
with
contemporary
standards
of
medical
decency.
it's
a
procedure
that
is
rarely
done.
when
it's
done
in
the
hospital,
it's
under
deep
sedation.
that
there
are
all
of
these
alternative
procedures
that
could
be
done
very
easily.
a
percutaneous
insertion
would
be
very
easy
to
accomplish.
there
are
a
lot--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--no,
ma'am.
it...
it
would
just
require
a...
a
needle,
a
hollow
needle,
with
a
wire
inside.
and...
and
they
would
then
access
the
vein
that
way.
it
wouldn't
require
the
kind
of
incision
and
all
of
the
kind
of
auxiliary
support
systems.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no.
they
wouldn't
effectuate
the
injection
that
way.
they
would
just
actually
get
access
to
the
vein
that
way.
and...
and
this
could
be
done,
your
honor,
24
hours
in
advance.
it
could
be
done
some
time
in
advance.
there
was
no
objection
expressed
by
mr.
nelson
in
any
of
the
lower
courts
to
that
procedure.
but
again,
all
of
these
issues
we
never
got
to
in
the
district
court.
there
was
never
any
opportunity
to
develop
facts,
to
have
discussion,
to
have
argument
to
resolve
a
basic
problem.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
my
position,
justice
o'connor,
would
be
if
i'm
representing
someone,
i
would
put
that
in
a
habeas
mostly
because
that's...
there
is
some
historical
precedent
for
those
kinds
of
challenges
coming
in
habeas.
i
think
you
are,
in
effect,
saying
that
the
sentence
is
invalid.
it...
it
should
not
be
carried
out.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no.
we
tried
really
hard
to
not
say
that.
what
we
say,
it
is
unconstitutional
to
proceed
with
venous
access
in
this
manner,
to
conduct
medical
care
in
this
manner.
it
violates
recognized
standards
of
medical
care.
and
that's
what
we're
saying
you
cannot
do.
we
have
no
objection.
mr.
nelson
doesn't
object
to
lethal
injection.
he
doesn't
even
object
to
venous
access.
what
he
objects
to
is
some
kind
of
inhumane
cutting
by
people
who
are
not
qualified
or
competent
to
do
that.
and
like
any
other
condition
of
confinement,
the
fact
that
he
is
near
an
execution,
the
fact
that
he
has
been
scheduled
for
an
execution
shouldn't
exempt
him
from
protection
if
the
state
at
the
last
minute
announces
that
this
is
what
they
intend
to
do.
this
has
not
historically
been
a
big
problem.
there
have
been
over
700
executions
in
this
country
involving
lethal
injections.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
justice
breyer,
i...
i
think
you're
right.
there
is
a
problem.
we
do
have
a
gap
in
the
law
in
that
the
congress
did
not
contemplate
the
possibility
of
execution
claims
that
arise
just
as
you
describe.
in
the
competency
context,
this
court
created
a
rule,
which
i
think
is
a
very
functional
rule.
i
think
it
is
a
very
appropriate
rule.
if
the
facts
supporting
that
claim
were
not
ripe
previously,
i
think
that...
and
it's
a
legitimate
execution-related
claim,
i
think
the
petitioner
should
be
able
to
get
access
in
front
of
the
district
court
judge
that
reviewed
his
initial
habeas
petition.
i
think
that's
the
way
we
should
deal--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes,
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
the
big--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
the
bigger
picture
in
my
judgment,
your
honor,
would
be
it
would
be
filed
as
a
habeas
petition
in
front
of
that
district
court
judge
relying
on
this
court's--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
it
would
be
part
of
the
first
habeas.
it
would--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
what
the--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
and--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
sir.
well,
in
stewart,
what
this
court
did
was
resolve
it
by
saying,
no,
congress
did
not
intend
to
preclude
petitioners
with
legitimate
execution
claims
from
getting
that.
this
court
has
created
those
protections.
i
think--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--no,
justice
o'connor,
unfortunately
not.
in
alabama
you
cannot
present
a
second
post-conviction
petition
even
on
claims
that...
that
turn
on
new
evidence.
on
execution
claims,
on
new
evidence
claims,
you
have
no
remedy.
and
consequently,
we
would
need
access
to
the
federal
courts
to
protect
mr.
nelson
from
the
kind
of
claim
that
we're
presenting
here
or
even
in
the
kind
of
claims
that
justice
breyer
is
suggesting.
and
that's
why
we
do
think
there
is
a
problem.
it's
not
presented
precisely
in
this
case.
there
is
a
problem
with
the
way
in
which
there
are
these
execution
claims.
if
some
state
says
tomorrow,
we're
going
to
change
our
method
and
from
here
on
out,
we're
going
to
stone
people
to
death
or
beat
them
to
death
with
baseball
bats,
and
this
court
believes
that
that
is
unconstitutional,
in
a
place
like
alabama,
to
the
extent
that...
that
the
court
construes
that
as
an
execution
claim...
and
that's
the
only
way
they
could
carry
out
the
execution,
so
it
might
be
said
that
that
would
invalidate
the
conviction
and
sentence...
we
would
need
a
rule.
we
would
need
to
find
some
way
to
get
access
to
courts,
and
we
currently
don't
have
it.
here--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
sir.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--no,
i
hear
you.
i
hear
you.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
sure.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
your
honor,
it's
not
our
position
that
he
is
seeking
and...
and
demanding
the
most
advanced
procedures.
what
i
think
he
is
objecting
to
is
something
that
we
regard
as
fairly
barbaric,
to
have
a
correctional
staff
member
come
back
with
a
scalpel,
make
a
2-inch
cut
in
his
arm,
cut
through
fat
and
tissue
to
get
to
a
vein
with
no
assurances
that
that
person
knows
what
they're
doing,
violates
the
basic
standards
of
medical
decency.
and
it's
not
just
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
this
court
has
created
a
line
of
cases
under
estelle
v.
gamble
that
talk
about
deliberate
indifference
to
serious
medical
needs.
this
is
a
medical
care
case.
yes,
he's
in
prison.
yes,
he's
on
death
row.
yes,
he's
forfeited
some
of
his
basic
expectations,
but
he
hasn't
given
them
all
away.
he's
still
entitled
to
be
treated
with
some
regard.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no.
it's...
it's
both.
we...
the
complaint
raises
both
the
cruel
and
unusual
theory
and
a
deliberate
indifference
theory.
both
are
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i...
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it...
it
fits
more
in
the
cruel
and
unusual
category
because
it
seems
so
pointless
to
be
doing
it
in
this
way.
however,
for
all
of
this
time,
there...
there
was
no
protocol.
there
was
no
response.
there
was
no,
in
effect,
effort
by
the
state
to
deal
with
this
problem
and
that's
why
we...
we
made
that
allegation
of
deliberate
indifference
as
well.
and
the
district
court
could
make
a
determination
that
says,
no,
following
this
case...
this
line
of
cases,
we...
we
can't
make
that
determination.
but
here,
we
never
got
to
any
of
this.
we
didn't
basically
have
an
opportunity--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
sir.
yes,
yes,
yes.
that's
correct.
and
so
we're
still
dealing
with
this...
the
eighth
amendment
universe.
but
again,
the
district
court
was
precluded
from
getting
to
any
of
this.
if
the
state
wants
to
come
in
and
say,
we
think
this
is
silly,
we
think
it
is
not
appropriate
for
the
constitution
to
create
these
kinds
of
protections
for
these
kinds
of
prisoners,
the
district
court
can
make
a
finding
that
says,
i
agree.
what
happened
here,
however,
was
the
district
court
was
precluded
from
ever
even
engaging
in
discussion
about
this
issue
because
of
this
rule
that,
in
effect,
blocks
people
on
death
row
facing
execution
and
enforcing
basic
constitutional
protections.
and
that's
what
we
think
is
objectionable.
there
are
several
hundred
executions
that
have
taken
place,
733,
lethal
injections
that
have
taken
place,
where
this
has
not
been
a
problem.
this
is
an...
an
unusual
medical
problem.
it's
not
a
medical
problem
that
usually
presents
itself,
but
it
presented
itself
for
the
first
time
in
alabama.
it's
only
come
up
a
few
times.
but
we
do
think
there
ought
to
be
some
constitutional
protection.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that
happened
in
july
of
2002,
after
mr.
nelson
had
already
completed
his
federal
habeas
procedure.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes,
sir.
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i...
i'd
like
to
start
first
by...
by
trying
desperately
to...
to
inform
this
court
that
there
is
no
remedy
available
to
mr.
nelson
in
state
court.
i
appreciate
mr.
newsom's
argument
on
this
point,
but
rule
32
is
not
an
available
option.
i--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--no,
they
did
not.
no,
justice
stevens.
there's
never
been
any--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--absolutely,
and
the
problem
here
is,
again,
none
of
these
issues
were...
were
permitted
to...
to
develop.
let
me
just
start
with
the
state
court
question.
rule
32
has
the
same
kind
of
factual
innocence
requirement.
for
the
6-month
time
line
that
mr.
newsom
was
talking
about,
yes,
you
can
file
a
new
successive
state
court
petition
under
rule
32,
but
just
as
you
have
to
in
the
federal
context,
the
state
court
petition
has
to
allege
factual
innocence.
in
footnote
19
of
our
reply
brief,
i
cite
a
case,
tarver
v.
state.
it's
a
case
where
immediately
before
an
execution,
the
prosecutor
admitted
that
he
had
excluded
african
americans
from
jury
service
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
he
said
here's
our
new
evidence.
the
execution
be...
should
be
stopped.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
held
no.
new
evidence
claims
must
go
to
factual
innocence.
that's
32.1(e).
there
is
no
remedy
available.
mr.
newsom
talks
about
filing
something
in
the
state
supreme
court.
the
state
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
no
jurisdiction--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
could
speak
to
that
because
in
the
other
case
we
cite
in
footnote
19,
we
did
that
too.
in
the
first
tarver
case,
this
court
had
granted
cert
on
the
constitutionality
of
execution
by
electrocution.
the
case
was
pending
at
this
court.
we
went
to
the
state
courts
of
alabama
saying,
look,
the
state
supreme...
the
united
states
supreme
court
is
about
to
review
this.
we've
got
new
evidence
that
electrocutions
in
alabama
are
being
conducted
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
let
us
in.
no.
your
method
of
execution
claim
is
not
cognizable
because
the
2-year
statute
of
limitations
at
that
time
is
an
absolute
bar.
the
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
any
constitutional
claim
unless
it
is
a
new
evidence
innocence
claim.
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
give
us
a
merits
review
on
this
issue.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
there
are
none,
justice
o'connor.
the
only
thing
we
could
do
is
file
a
motion
for
a
stay.
at
the
point
at
which
the
stay
motion
was
requested
here,
april
of
2000,
mr.
nelson
didn't
want
a
stay.
he
doesn't
want
a
stay
of
execution.
he
actually
wants
his
execution
to
be
carried
out.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
absolutely.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
he
wants
a
stay
to...
he
wants
to
enjoin
the
kind
of
conduct
that
we're
talking
about
here,
but
filing
a
stay
motion
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
would
not
get
him
merits
review
where
we
could
present
the
kind
of
facts
that
we're
now
presenting.
and
i
have
to
say
that
access
to
the
federal
courts
in
this
case
has
really
changed
the
state's
position.
nothing
that
we've
been
talking
here
this
afternoon
about
what
they
intend
to
do
was
ever
presented
to
mr.
nelson
until
he
got
in
front
of
the
federal
judge.
in
front
of
the
federal
judge,
they
said
for
the
first
time,
we
will
try
to
do
a
peripheral
stick,
not
percutaneous
invasion.
it's
a
different
procedure.
and
at
page
109
of
our
joint
appendix,
the
district
court
finds...
and
i'm
reading
here...
the
defendants
have
offered
no
explanation
as
to
why
they
intend
to
use
a
cut-down
procedure
instead
of
a
percutaneous
central
line
placement.
they
have
never
made
that
offer.
they're
making
it
here
today.
it's
because
we're
in
court,
and
of
course,
we
can't
get
to
court
unless
this
court
recognizes
our
authority
to
bring
a
legitimate
challenge
that
does
not
attempt
to
invalidate
his
conviction
or
sentence.
there
is
a
gap.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
if...
if
the
state
had
then
and
would
now
concede
that
percutaneous
line
placement
would
be
an
acceptable
method,
then
yes.
that's
all
we
were
seeking.
but
of
course,
without
a
remedy--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
it's
not
said
in
a
way
that
we
can
enforce,
your
honor.
until
we
can
go
to
the
district
court,
go
to
a
court,
and
enforce
any
of
these
representations,
we
are
at
risk.
and
that's
all
we're
asking.
that's
all
mr.
nelson
asked
in
the
first
instance.
and
the
irony,
of
course,
is
if
it
had
been
permitted
to
proceed,
i
think
we
would
have
resolved
this.
he'd
already
be
executed.
and
i
think
their
conduct
today
strengthens
that
position.
and
that's
why
we
would
urgently
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
rule
that
the
eleventh
circuit
is
now
applying
which
bars
prisoners
like
mr.
nelson
from
getting
federal
review.
it's
not
asking
a
lot.
and
i
understand
the
fears,
but
i
don't
agree
with
mr.
newsom
that
this
is
opening
up
anything.
people
can
file
complaints
now.
they
could
have
done
it
for
the
last
20
years.
but
district
courts
are
not
obligated
to
review
those
complaints.
the
plra
puts
restrictions
on
1983
actions.
the
habeas
corpus
right
permits...
creates
restrictions.
what
this
court
shouldn't
do
out
of
fear
is
to
block
prisoners
like
mr.
nelson
who
have
legitimate
constitutional
complaints
from
getting
remedies
that
are
precisely
the
kinds
of
claims
that
could
and
should
be
resolved
in
a
manner
that
they've
been
discussed
about...
discussed
today
easily.
we
tried
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies,
but
until
we
got
in
front
a
federal
judge,
no
one
would
allow
us
to
be
heard.
and
that's
simply
the
problem
that
we
face
in
this
case
and
why
relief
is
required.
and
i
think
that's
why
there
ought
to
be
the
kind
of
federal...
federal
remedy
that
justice
breyer
has
indicated
because
without
it,
our
prisoners
are
at
risk.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i'll...
i'll
rest--
