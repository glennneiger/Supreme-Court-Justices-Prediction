mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
make
three
points
this
morning.
i'd
like
to
first
discuss
and
to
convince
the
court
that
a
challenge
to
a
state's
means
of
gaining
venous
access
for
purposes
of
accomplishing
a
lethal
injection,
a
challenge
that
runs
to
the
very
core
of
the
execution
process,
is
indeed
tantamount
to
a
challenge
of
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
itself
and
subject
to
habeas
corpus
restrictions.
i
hope
also
to...
to
be
able
to
address
the
remedies
issue,
which
we
were
discussing
with
mr.
stevenson
at
the
end
of...
of
his
argument.
and
third,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
practical
consequences
of
a
decision
in
nelson's
favor
in
this
case,
which
i
think
will
be
not
only
to
unleash
in
federal
courts
a
torrent
of...
of
new
challenges
to
all
manner
of
state
execution
procedures,
but
also
in
the
process,
fundamentally
to
undermine
congress'
intent
to
stem
the
tide
of
what
president
clinton
in
his
signing
statement
called
endless
death
row
appeals.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
i
can
certainly
address
that,
your
honor,
and
i
can
address
it
now,
if
you'd
like.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
yes.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
we
simply
cannot
agree
with...
with...
with
mr.
stevenson's
contention
here
that
this
is
second
or
successive,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
i...
that
i
think--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i'm
sorry.
that...
that
is
not
second
or
successive.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
think
in
fact
there
is
a
concession
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
it,
in
fact,
is
second
or
successive.
mr.
stevenson,
of
course,
has...
has
given
the
court
essentially
a
two-page
footnote
in
his
brief
trying
to
walk
away
from--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--correct.
our...
correct.
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
this...
that
this
sort
of
challenge
is
fundamentally
a
habeas
challenge,
and
in
answer
to
justice
souter's
question,
i
think
that
there
is
a
concession
on
the
record.
of
course,
this...
this
issue,
the
second
or
successive
issue,
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
courts.
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--and
our
position
certainly
is,
your
honor,
that
this
would
have
been
barred
as
second
or
successive.
i
think
justice
scalia
really
hit
the
nail
on
the
head.
it
is...
mr.
stevenson,
in
his
argument,
just
has
not
done
business,
i
think,
with
the
textual
and
structural
gymnastics
required
to...
to
make
this
petition
anything
other
than
second
or
successive.
his
position,
in
essence,
is
that
any
claim
that
is
new,
in
the
sense
that
it
could
not
have
been
brought
before,
is
by
definition
not
second
or
successive.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
my
own
sense,
justice
souter,
is
that
that
might
just
be
slicing
the
bologna
a
little
thin.
congress...
the...
the
point
of
section
2244
in
my
view
is
certainly
to
get
at
claims
that,
for
whatever
reason,
could
not
have
been
brought
earlier,
and
i
think
the--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--perhaps,
but
i
think
that
we
are
coming
awfully
close
simply
to...
to
reading
the
limitations
that
congress
imposed
on
these
sorts
of
petitions
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
that's
certainly
the
position
that--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that's--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--which
is
exactly
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
about
stripping
out
the
limitations.
in
section
2244--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--it...
it...
i...
i
think
it
is
not
the
case,
your
honor,
that...
that
second
or
successive
is
a
term
of
art
in
the
sense
that...
that
aedpa
in
section
2244
merely
incorporates
the
old
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
as...
as
this
court
made--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--again,
your...
your
honor,
i...
i
feel
like
clearly
i'm
not
convincing
you,
but
i
think
that...
that
we
are...
that
the
court
would
be
coming
awfully--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that
the
court...
the
court
is
certainly
coming
awfully
close
to
simply
stripping
out
the
limitations
on
the
statute--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
what...
what
should
happen?
isn't...
isn't
(b)(i)
a
description
of
what
our
prior
successive
habeas--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--the...
the--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--law
was?
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--the
court--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that's
absolutely
right,
and
that--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that's
the--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i...
i--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--precisely.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
which
is
precisely
the
point
we
tried
to
make
in
our
brief,
that
under--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i
don't
think
it
can,
your
honor,
and...
and
i--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
and
why
not?
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i
hope
i
can
convince
why
it
can't.
i'd
like
to
start
by
addressing
that
position
with
mr.
stevenson's
concession
here
this
morning
that
he
has
reiterated,
that
the
chemical
composition
claim
indeed
is
subject
to
habeas
corpus
restrictions.
of
course,
he
seeks
to
distinguish
his
own
claim
from
the
chemical
composition
claim
on
the
basis,
he
says,
that
his
claim
does
not
challenge
the
sentence
itself,
but
merely
a
separate
and
unnecessary
procedure.
but
the
procedure
he
challenges
is
a
procedure
for
gaining
venous
access.
it
goes
without--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
let
me
just...
if
i
could
answer
in
two
parts.
first,
i
think
frankly
that...
that
on
the
record
in
this
case,
he's
just
not
right
about
that.
the
record
at
pages
91
and
93
of
the
joint
appendix
makes
clear
that
the
specific
procedure
that
he
has
challenged
here,
this
cut-down
procedure,
will
be
used
only
as
a
last
resort
in
the
event
that
other
means
of
gaining
venous
access--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--the
percutaneous
central
line
placement.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
by
all
means.
and
that's
part
of
the
irony
of
this
case.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
oh,
absolutely.
and...
and
in
fact,
the...
the
affidavits
that
we
filed
make
that
assurance.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
that
will
be
attempted.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
yes.
and...
and
let
me
just
be
clear
that...
that
the
state,
of
course,
has
outlined
a
three-step
process
in
this
case.
steps
one
and
two
are
a
central
line
placement
in
the
femoral
vein
and
a
central
line
placement
in
the
jugular
vein
in
the
neck.
both
of
those,
in
essence,
are
percutaneous
central
line
placements.
so
the
parties
are
in
agreement
here
that
the
first
two
procedures
attempted
should,
in
fact,
be
percutaneous
central
line
placement.
this
cut-down
procedure
comes
into
play
only
in
the
event
that
those
two
procedures
fail
and
as
a
last
resort
must
be
used
to
accomplish
the
sentence.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
the
important
point
here...
and
i--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--sure,
absolutely.
and
i
can't
agree,
of
course,
with
mr.
stevenson's
description
of
alabama
law.
i
think
that
there
very
clearly
are
remedies
in
the
state
courts,
and
his
argument
essentially
asks
the...
this
court
to
ignore
those...
the
entire
state
system.
with
respect
to
two
of
the
remedies--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
he
is,
of
course...
i...
i
should
just
be
careful
about
how
i
answer
this
question.
there
is
an
alabama
procedure
called
a
rule
32
petition
which
is...
is,
in
effect,
a...
a
state
habeas
petition
to
challenge
things
like
this.
and
his...
his
position
in
his
reply
brief
is
that...
that
a
rule
32
petition
would
have
been
time
barred.
that
may
be
true
now,
but
it
was
not
true
as
of
the
time
that
he
filed
this
petition.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
may
i
just--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--may...
may
i
continue
with
the
alabama
courts
just
on
a
minute
because
that's
not...
that's
not...
i'm
not
done
with
the
alabama
courts,
in
essence.
i
mean,
there...
there
are
other
remedies
that
we've
outlined
in--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i
think
very
arguably.
it
comes
down
frankly
to
how
you...
at...
at
what
point
that
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run.
our
position,
of
course--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--rule
32
statute
of
limitations
is
a...
is
a
6-month
statute
of
limitations
that
begins
running
at
the
time
new...
a
new
factual
predicate
is
discovered.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
i
see.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
that...
that...
if...
if
the
statute
began
to
ran...
began...
began
to
run,
as...
as
we
would
say,
on
august
19th
of
2003,
when
the
record
at
pages
25
and
26
of
the
joint
appendix
makes
plain
that
he
knew
that
a
cut-down
was
a
possibility
as
a
means
of
gaining
access
to
his
veins,
then
yes,
that
statute
has
expired.
if,
as
mr.
stevenson
has
pointed
out
to
the
court
today,
that
statute
began
to
ran
not...
began
to
run...
why
do
i
keep
saying
that...
began
to
run
on
october
3rd
of
2003,
then
the
truth
is
he
has
4
or
5
more
days
to
file
that
rule
32
petition.
but
i
want
to
get
to
the
other
remedies,
if
i
can.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
he
can
get
into--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--he
can...
of
course,
by
all
means.
this
court
retains
the
discretion,
as
it
always
does,
to
grant
in
an
extraordinary
circumstance
an
original
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and
i--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
not--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--there
is
not
i
think
a
remedy
in
lower
federal
courts.
but
i
should
just
emphasize
that
this
court
has...
has
discussed
a
case
very
similar
to
this
and
dealt
with
a
case
very
similar
to
this
in
allen
v.
mccurry
where
the
court
refused
to
indulge--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
because
our...
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
1983
is
not
intended
to
be
used
to
fill
the
gaps
in
the
remedial
scheme
that
congress
has
specifically
set
up
in
the
habeas
statutes,
that
instead
section
1983
deals
with
different
kinds
of
claims.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
no.
but
the
point
is,
of
course,
aedpa
does
not
have,
in
effect,
an
integration
clause
in
it
that...
that
precludes
review
of
all...
under
all
other
statutory
sources
of
review.
but
this
court's
decision--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--no.
i
think
then
it...
then
it
clearly...
it's
a...
it's
a
habeas
petition
however
you...
however
you
view
it,
and...
and
our--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--to
be
sure.
and
that
i
think
is
a...
is
a
categorical
distinction.
i
don't
disagree
with
mr.
stevenson
that...
that
a...
that
a
cut-down
occurring
for
purposes
of
venous
access,
wholly
divorced
from
an
execution,
is
indeed
a
valid
conditions
of
confinement
claim.
but
this
simply
is
not
a
conditions
of
confinement
case.
this
is,
to
be
sure,
a
procedure
of...
the
means
of
gaining
venous
access
for
the
purposes
of...
of
carrying
out
a
lethal
injection.
venous
access,
of
course,
is
a
necessary
predicate,
as
nelson
has
acknowledged
in
his
briefing
in
this
case,
to...
to
the--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i
think
it
will
fall
pretty
hard,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that
if...
if
this
court
concludes
that...
that
nelson
in
this
case
can...
can
challenge
this...
this
cut-down
as
a
means
of
gaining
venous
access,
then
the...
the
lower
courts
will
be
inundated
with...
with
challenges
to
all
manner
of
state
execution
procedures
just
as
this
court
was
inundated
with
challenges
following--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that's--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
that
certainly
is
one
way
of...
of
dealing
with
the
problem,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
in
answer--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--let
me
try
to
answer
these
various
questions
in
order,
if
i
can
keep
up.
with
respect
to
your
first
question,
i
think
that
to
be
sure,
there
is...
the...
the
district
court
can
always
reject
the
claim,
but
the
problem
is
that
when
these
claims
come
in
at
the
last
minute
and
the
complaint
is
chock
full
of...
of
inflammatory
language,
then
the
district
courts
i
think
in...
in
many
cases
will
feel
virtually
coerced
into
granting
the
stay.
and
the
stay
itself
is...
is
an
imposition
or
an
impediment
to
the
state's
imposition
of
the
sentence.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
to
be
sure.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
okay.
now--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--bear
with
me.
section
1983,
to
be
sure,
does
not
exclude
this
claim
as
a
matter
of
its
text,
but
this
court
in
preiser
did
make
clear
that...
that
where
a...
where
an
action
falls
within
the
traditional
scope
of
habeas
corpus,
that
section
1983
must
give
way.
when
there
is
that
intersection,
section
1983
must
give
way.
now,
in
answer
to
part
two
of
the
question,
to
be
sure,
the
habeas
corpus...
the...
the
specific
language
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
talks
in
terms
of
custody,
but
for
more
than
100
years,
this
court
has
dealt
with
challenges
to
death
sentences
in
habeas
corpus
petitions.
and
indeed,
in
your
honor's
opinion
for
the
court
in
lonchar,
this
court
said
that...
that--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--bear
with
me.
citing
gomez
and...
and
reiterated
that
habeas
restrictions
apply
to
suits
challenging
the
method
of
execution
regardless
of
the
technical
form
of
action.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
i
think
that's
just
not
quite
right.
percutaneous
central
line
placement
simply
means
central
line
placement
through
the
skin.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
they...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
i
didn't
mean
to--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that...
that
in
fact
those
first
two...
what
the...
what
the
plaintiffs
asked
for
in
this
case
was
indeed
percutaneous
central
line
placement.
that's
the
label
not
that
i'm
giving
it
but
that
they
gave
it.
that's
the
procedure
that
they
wanted,
and
now
i'm
trying
to
tell
the
court
that...
that
percutaneous
central
line
placement
is
a
central
line
placement
through
the
skin
which
options
one
and
two,
central
line
placement
in
the
thigh,
central
line
placement
in
the
neck,
are
indeed
both
percutaneous
central
line
placement.
so,
no,
there
is...
i
think
there
is
no
disagreement
here
that
percutaneous
central
line
placement
is
the
preferred
method
and
will,
in
fact,
be
used,
a
cut-down
to
be
used
only
if
actually
necessary.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
fair
enough.
and
if
i
can,
just
in
answer
to
the...
to
the
first
question
that
you
were
asking
me,
my...
the
point
that
i
was
making
about
gomez
at
this
point
in
the
argument
is
not
necessarily,
although
i'd
like
to
make
this
point
as
well,
if
i
have
time,
an
abuse
point
so
much.
we
certainly
recognize
that
the
abuse
at
issue
in
gomez
is
in
some
sense
more...
more
egregious
than
the
abuse
here.
the
point
i
was
simply
trying
to
make
in
answer...
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
was
that
this
court
in
lonchar
pointed
to
gomez
for
the
proposition
that
habeas
rules
apply
to
method
of
execution
claims
without
respect
to
what
label
is
placed
at
the
top
of
the
pleading.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
accurately
describes.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
i
think...
i
think
it
is
fairly
clear,
your
honor,
from
gomez
and
lonchar,
read
together,
that
method
of
execution--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i
think
it
is
unquestionably
correct,
justice
scalia,
that
this
court
has
held
that
habeas
is
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
a
method
of
execution
claim
or
otherwise.
and
my
point
in
answer
to
justice
breyer
is
i
think
that
this
court's
decisions
in
gomez
and
lonchar,
read
together,
make...
come
pretty
close
to
saying
that
it
is
the
appropriate...
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
challenging
a
method--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--the
strongest
support
i
think,
yes,
for
the...
for
the
fact
that
a...
that
a
habeas...
that
habeas
is...
is
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
a
method
of
execution
claim.
and
i
should
just
be
clear...
and
we're
getting
back
here
to
justice
kennedy's
question...
that
if...
if
we're
rolling
back
habeas
all
the
way
to
simply
the
fact
of
the
sentence
and
you
can
challenge
nothing
other
than
to
say
i
should
not
have
been
sentenced
to
the
death
penalty,
then
we
have
a...
an
even
bigger
floodgates
issue
that
i
had...
had
at
first
imagined.
district
courts
tomorrow
will
be
dealing
with
everything
short
of
i
should
not
have
been
sentenced
to
the
death
penalty
under
section
1983
without
the
protections
that
congress
built
in...
built
into
aedpa
to
protect
against
that
very
floodgates
problem.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
to
be
sure.
there...
there
is
clearly
some
common
sense
line
between
a
pure
conditions
of
confinement
claim,
the
fellow
in
his
cell
that
has
to
have
the
cut-down
for
some
other
purpose,
and
the...
the
fellow
on
death
row
who
has
to
have
the
cut-down
as
a
means
of
gaining
access
to
his
veins
for
purposes
of
accomplishing
a
lethal
injection.
without
the
venous
access,
there
is
no
lethal
injection.
i
think
there
is
a
very
real
difference
between
those
two
situations,
and
i
can't,
as
i'm
standing
here,
promise
you
that
i
know
precisely
where
that
line
is
between
the
outer
bounds
of
an
execution
procedures
claim
and
the
outer
bounds
of
a
conditions
of
confinement
claim,
but
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
this
claim
runs
to
the
very
core
of
the
state's
execution
process.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
it
just
strikes
me,
justice
souter,
that
that
with
respect...
well,
let
me
answer
in
two
ways.
first,
as
i
said
earlier,
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear
that
the
cut-down
becomes
a
live
issue
only
in...
in
the
event
that
it
is
necessary.
point
two,
and
i
think
the
more
important
point,
is
that
it
just
strikes
me
as
a
bad
way
to
administer
the
rule
on
a
going-forward
basis
for
a
district
court
to
have
to
sift
through
on
a
procedure-by-procedure
basis
to
determine
is
this
procedure
in
fact
medically,
scientifically
necessary
to
accomplish
the
sentence,
in
which
case
mr.
stevenson
i
think
concedes
that
it's
a
habeas
petition,
but
it's
not.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
i
certainly
am
not
suggesting
in
any...
to
any
extent
that...
and
i
don't
think
it's
true...
that...
that
to
extent
that,
say,
a...
a
technically
unnecessary
but
nonetheless
chosen
procedure
for
gaining
venous
access
is
unreviewable.
that's
the
point...
that's
the
discussion
that
i
was
having
with
justice--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--right.
and...
and
our
point
is...
is
that
that
is
fine
if
he
wants
to
litigate
and
we
will
litigate
and
fight
him
tooth
and
nail
in
the
appropriate
forum.
the
appropriate
forum
in
this
case--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--with
respect,
justice
souter,
the
appropriate
forum
in
this
case
exists.
it
exists
in
the
state
court
system.
it
is...
it
simply
is
not
the
case
that
mr....
that
mr.
nelson
is
out
of
luck
entirely
without
a
1983--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--your
honor,
i
think
that
there
certainly
are
procedures.
we
outlined
procedures
in
our
brief,
namely,
the
two
that
we
have
not
discussed
to
this
point
were
that
mr.
nelson
could
have
filed
a
response
to
the
state's
motion
to
set
the
execution
date,
and
two,
he
could
have
filed
a
motion
to
stay
the
execution
in
state
court.
now--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--those--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--in
alabama?
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--those
procedures,
your
honor,
are
in
fact
open
to...
to
the
prisoner
today
because
when
this
court
stayed
the
execution,
the
death
warrant
expired.
we
will
now
need
to
go
back
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
even...
even
in
the
event
that
we
prevail
here
and
ask
for
a
new
death
warrant,
at
which
point
mr.
nelson
can...
can
participate
in
the
state
process--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--what
i...
what
i
can
represent
to
the
court
is
that
i
am
certainly
not
aware
of
any
procedural
bars
that
exist
to
him
participating
in
either
one
of
those
processes,
and
that
certainly
with
respect
to
mr.
nelson,
we
would...
we
would
be
glad
to
waive
any
procedural
bar
that
did
exist.
we
would
certainly
expect
the--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--sure.
if
he...
if
he
chooses,
as...
as
we
hope
he
will...
as
we
hope
he
would
have
and
now
hope
he
will,
to
participate
in
the
state
process,
he
will
get
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
his
eighth
amendment
claim.
and
again,
i'm
not
suggesting--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that's
right
and
that's...
that's
very
close,
your
honor,
to
the...
to
the
very
situation
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
allen
v.
mccarty.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
to...
to
be
sure.
this
court
always
retains
cert
jurisdiction
over
merits
determinations
of
state
courts.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
i
don't
think,
justice
breyer,
that
this
case
even
presents
a
suspension--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i
think
it's
not
in
this
court--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--please
read
felker.
this
court's
decision
in
felker
is
quite
clear
that
pointing
specifically
to
section
2244,
this
court
said
congress,
by
and
large,
gets
to
make
judgments
about
the
scope
of
the
writ.
section
2244
is
not
a
suspension.
we're
not
even
in
the
ball
park
of
an
across-the-board
bar
on...
on
jurisdiction.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
that's...
that's
certainly
true,
but
i
guess
it
assumes
that...
that
i'm
wrong
about...
about
the
nature
of
this
claim.
our
position,
of
course,
as
i've
tried
to
convince
the
court--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--your...
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
this
will
give
me
i
think
a...
as
good
an
opportunity
as
i
can
to
try
to
sum
up
our
position
in
this
case.
we
have
certainly
made
the
argument
that
a
challenge
to
a
state's
means
of
gaining
venous
access,
a
challenge
to...
to
a
procedure
for
carrying
out
an
execution
is
in
and
of
itself...
should
be
understood
to
be
a
challenge
to
the
sentence
itself
and
subject
to
habeas
corpus
restrictions.
the
state
amici,
the
30
states
who
have
participated
in
this
case
on
our
behalf,
have
made
very
strongly
the
argument
that
a...
that
a
stay
of
execution
in
and
of
itself
should
be
understood
as
a
challenge
to
the
sentence.
the
court
need
not
go
so
far
in
either
respect
with
us
today.
all
we
ask
the
court
to
hold
today
is
that
where...
where
an
inmate
both
challenges
a
procedure
for
carrying
out
his
execution
and,
in
essence,
tries
to
tell
the
state,
dictate
to
the
state
how
to
go
about
conducting
that
execution,
and
seeks
a
stay
of
that
execution
to
give
himself
time
to
engage
in
that
reordering
of
the
process,
that
that
should
be
understood
as
a
challenge
to
the
sentence.
