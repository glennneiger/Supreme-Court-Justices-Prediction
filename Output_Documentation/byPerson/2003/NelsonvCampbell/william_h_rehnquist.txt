david
nelson
v.
donal
campbell.
mr.
stevenson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did...
did
he
ask
for
a
postponement
of
the
execution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
would
have
been
the
terms
of
the
postponement
that
you
were
asking
for?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
it...
was
it
any
more
than
the
presence
of
his
own
doctor
to
make
the
cut
that
he...
he
was
asking
for?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
this
isn't
a
contract
action.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
just
doesn't
fit
under
deliberate
indifference
somehow.
it's
a
little
bit
like
the
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
you
couldn't
use
a
lethal
injection
because
it
hadn't
been
approved
by
the
fda.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when...
when
did
alabama
switch
from
electrocution
to
lethal
injections?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
before
that,
electrocution
was
the
only
option?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
stevenson.
mr.
newsom,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
would
also
have
the
opportunity
to
seek
a
stay,
would
he
not,
from
this
court
from
the
decision
of
the
alabama
court
saying
that
his
eighth
amendment
claim
was--
chief
justice
rehnquist
may
i--
--thank
you,
mr.
newsom.
mr.
stevenson,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stevenson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
03-6821,
nelson
against
campbell
will
be
