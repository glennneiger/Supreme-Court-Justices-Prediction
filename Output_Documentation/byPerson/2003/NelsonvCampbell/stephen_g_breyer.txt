what
is...
as
a
lawyer
who
works
in
this
area,
what
do
you
think
is
the
correct
procedure
that
should
be
followed
in
respect
to
ford
mental
incompetence
claims
or
general
challenges
to
a
whole
big
method
of
execution
not
just
this
individual
one
which
arise
for
the
first
time
after
termination
of
a
first
habeas?
justice
breyer
yes,
that
may
be.
so
what's
the
procedural
route?
that's
why
i'm
curious.
justice
breyer
this
fits
into
a
bigger
picture.
justice
breyer
and
i'd
like
to
be
clear
about
the
bigger
picture--
justice
breyer
--in
your
opinion.
justice
breyer
and...
and
you
say
that
it
would
be...
count
as
a
first
habeas.
justice
breyer
well,
what
the...
what
the
response
to
that
is
it's
very
hard
to
reconcile
that
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
breyer
and...
and
also
they
add
that
the
right
route
is
to
file
an
initial
habeas
here
or,
alternatively,
to
go
to
the
state
court,
at
least
if
that's
still
open.
justice
breyer
in
which
case
it
raises
no
constitutional
question
about
blocking
habeas
because
we
could
review
the
state
court.
i'd
just
like
briefly
your
views
on
that
kind
of
an
argument.
justice
breyer
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
to
deal
with
that.
one,
you
could
say
on
the
merits,
if
they're
not
valid,
they're
not
valid.
justice
breyer
if
they
are
valid,
why
shouldn't
they
be
able
to
make
it?
justice
breyer
or
there's
the
equitable
problem--
--how
long
do
the
appeals
take?
justice
breyer
the
district
court
says
it's
not
valid.
get
out
of
here.
then
there's
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
certiorari
here.
how
long
does
it
take?
and
suppose
in
a
case
where
there
is
whips
and
so
forth,
he
happens,
by
the
way,
actually
to
have
a
valid
claim
because
they're
going
to
be
tortured.
all
right.
now,
you're
saying
there's
no
remedy
for
such
a
person.
justice
breyer
and
indeed,
the
reason
there's
no
remedy
is
because
the
courts
are
unable
to
use
their
normal
rules
to
prevent
abuse
of
process.
justice
breyer
but
there's
nothing
in
the
language.
i
mean,
as
i
read
the
language
of
1983,
it
says
there
will
be
an
action,
if
i'm
subject
to
the
deprivation
of
a
right
secured
by
the
constitution,
which
is
what
his
claim
is.
so
it
fits
within
the
language.
justice
breyer
and
there's
nothing
in
the
habeas
statute
that
suggests
it
fits
because
habeas
is
when
you're
challenging
a
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
so
the
habeas
language
doesn't
apply
and
1983
does
apply.
and
there's
nothing
in
preiser
that
suggests
it
fits
because
that's
where
in
fact
we're
talking
about
a
challenge
to
fact
or
duration,
and
he's
not
challenging
the
fact
and
he's
not
challenging
the
duration.
and
there's
nothing
in
heck
v.
humphrey
because
it
talks
about
necessarily
implying
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
or
sentence,
and
he's
not
talking
about
the
conviction
and
he's
not
talking
about
the
sentence
that
was
given
in
the
judgment
anyway.
all
right.
so
how
is
it
we
get
this
claim
which
risks
people
who
might
have
a
valid
claim
not
getting
into
court--
justice
breyer
--into
the
language
of
any
prior
case
or
the
statute
itself?
justice
breyer
you're
right
about
that.
justice
breyer
it
wasn't
an
issue
in
that
case,
was
it?
i
was
simply
describing
what
happened.
i
mean,
it
was
true--
justice
breyer
--in
that
case
it
was...
yes,
accurately
described
it.
nobody
challenged
it.
so
i
wouldn't
think
that's
terrifically
strong
precedent
for
the
proposition
that
that
is
what
should
have
happened.
justice
breyer
but
is
there
anything
other
than...
other
than...
lonchar,
which
is
describing
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
appeared
here
on
a
different
issue?
i
thought
we
had
a
lot
of
cases
that...
that
say
you
can
bring
habeas
to
challenge
not
only--
--that's
what
i
want
to
know.
i
want
to
know
which
are
the
ones--
--let's
go
one
at
a
time.
go
ahead.
i
thought
that
it...
it
was
our
law
that...
that
you
can
bring
a
habeas
action
to
show
that
you
are
not
guilty
of
the
sentence,
which
always
seemed
to
me
a
very
strange
formulation,
but
it's...
it's
been
done
in
a
lot
of
cases.
justice
breyer
so
those
are
the
two
cases
which
you
feel
are
the
strongest
support
for
you.
justice
breyer
--would
we
have
to
go
into
the
question
of
whether
that's
a
suspension
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
a
case,
say,
much
worse
than
this
one?
it's
horrendous.
he
couldn't
raise
it
before.
no
access
to
a
federal
district
court.
justice
breyer
no,
no,
no.
but
just
imagine
this
case
with
much
horrible
circumstance
because
your
rule
of
law
is
the
same,
irrespective
of
the
horror
of
the
circumstance.
so
there
would
be
no
claim
but
a
state
court
for
a
person
who
could
never
had
brought
a
federal
habeas
because
the
issue
didn't
arise.
is
that
a
suspension
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
not
in
time
of
war?
justice
breyer
and
you'd
refer
me,
because
there's
only
a
minute,
to
read
on
that
so
i'd
become
convinced
what?
