justice
o'connor
well,
presumably
at
a
much
earlier
date,
the
prisoner
did
know
that
he...
he
was...
he
would
be
scheduled
to
be
executed
by
lethal
injection.
justice
o'connor
and
he
did
know
his
veins
were
compromised.
justice
o'connor
so...
so
presumably
in...
well
in
advance
he
could
anticipate
a
problem.
justice
o'connor
doesn't
that
require
a
cut
as
well?
justice
o'connor
if
a
challenge
is
brought
to
the
use
of
lethal
injection
as
a
method
of
execution,
how
must
that
be
brought?
in
habeas?
justice
o'connor
this
comes
close
because
you
say
it's
unconstitutional
to
proceed
with
lethal
injection
under
these
circumstances.
justice
o'connor
was
there...
was
there
anything
open
to
this
petitioner
in
the
state
for
an
application
for
relief
here?
justice
o'connor
you
mean
if
it's
treated
as
habeas.
justice
o'connor
well,
so
can
it
be
brought
as
a
1983
action?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
are
other
ways
to
do
it--
justice
o'connor
--is
his
point.
and
it
is
a
little
curious
that
the
state
isn't
willing
to
talk
to
the
prisoner's
counsel
about
considering
one
of
the
other
ways
of
doing
it.
why
is
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
does
that
mean
that...
what
is
the
description
of
the
other?
the--
justice
o'connor
--percutaneous.
is
that
something
the
state
is
prepared
to
use
first?
justice
o'connor
and
you
make
that
assurance
to
us
today.
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
try
this
again.
what
procedure
is
open
to
him
in
the
state
of
alabama?
we
were
told
that
no
procedure
was.
justice
o'connor
well,
we're
talking
about
now.
what
is
open
to
the
prisoner
today--
justice
o'connor
we
were
told
there
were
a
couple
of
other
methods
besides
rule
32.
justice
o'connor
well,
he
did
ask
for
a
stay
you
said,
in
order
that
this
could
be
resolved.
justice
o'connor
so,
as
i
understand
it,
he
does
want
a
stay
in
order
that
this
can
be
heard.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
we
heard
today,
does
that
satisfy
the
prisoner's
request
that
these...
all
of
these
other
things
be
used
first?
justice
o'connor
is
that
not
what
was
said
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
and
was
given
a
death
sentence.
the
petitioner
has
severely
compromised
veins
which
are
inaccessible
by
standard
techniques
for
gaining
intravenous
access
for
administration
of
a
lethal
injection.
the
weeks
before
he
scheduled
execution,
the
petitioner
learned
that
alabama
prison
officials
intended
to
use
a
so-called
cut-down
procedure
to
access
his
veins
if
they
were
unable
to
access
them
with
a
needle.
the
petitioner
who
had
already
filed
once
an
unsuccessful
habeas
application
filed
a
complaint
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983,
claiming
that
use
of
the
cut-down
procedure
would
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
he
sought
a
stay
of
the
execution.
the
district
court
dismissed
ruling
that
the
petitioner’s
request
for
temporary
and
permanent
injunctive
relief
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
second
or
successive
habeas
corpus
petition.
that
was
affirmed
by
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
is
true
that
prisoners
cannot
use
section
1983
injunctive
actions
to
challenge
the
fact
or
duration
of
their
confinement.
otherwise,
they
could
easily
circumvent
the
procedural
and
substantive
restrictions
contained
in
the
federal
habeas
statute.
but
section
1983
is
available
for
petitioners
to
challenge
the
conditions
of
their
confinement.
we
have
not
yet
addressed
whether
an
inmate’s
challenge
to
a
state
method
of
execution
constitutes
a
challenge
to
the
fact
of
an
inmate’s
death
sentence
or
the
conditions
of
death
sentence.
we
do
not
reach
that
broad
question
here.
the
respondents
concede
that
section
1983
would
be
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
a
prison
inmate
who
is
not
facing
execution
to
challenge
use
of
a
cut-down
procedure
to
access
his
veins
for
purposes
of
medical
treatment.
we
see
no
reason
to
treat
petitioner’s
claim
differently
solely
because
he
has
been
condemned
to
die.
if
as
a
legal
matter,
the
cut-down
were
a
statutorily
mandated
part
of
alabama’s
lethal
injection
protocol
or
if
as
a
factual
matter
petitioner
were
unable
or
unwillingly
to
concede
alternatives
for
obtaining
venous
access,
the
respondents
might
have
a
stronger
argument
that
success
on
the
merits
and
an
injunction
would
call
into
question
the
death
sentence
itself.
but
the
petitioner
has
been
careful
in
his
complaint
and
throughout
these
proceedings
to
argue
that
the
cut-down
procedure
is
wholly
unnecessary
as
a
factual
and
legal
matter
and
to
propose
alternatives
that,
if
used,
would
allow
alabama
to
proceed
with
the
execution.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
