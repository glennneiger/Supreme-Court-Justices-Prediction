but
your
deliberate
indifference
claim
is
also
an
eighth
amendment
claim,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
if...
if
any.
is
there
a
remedy?
justice

what
would
the
remedy
be
in
alabama?
it
would
be
a
habeas

proceeding?
justice
stevens
well,
let's
assume
he...
assume
he's
denied
relief
in
the
alabama
courts.
what
can
he
do?

to
this

treatment
for
6

under
1983?
justice
stevens
