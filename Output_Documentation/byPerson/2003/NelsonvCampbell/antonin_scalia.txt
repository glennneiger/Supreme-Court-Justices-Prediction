justice
scalia
well,
they're...
they're
not
saying
that.
they
can
bring
actions
that...
that
challenge
unconstitutional
conditions
of
confinement.
he's
being
kept
in
a
dank
and
dark
cell
that's...
that's
cruel
and
painful.
the
only
thing
they're
saying
he
can't
bring
is...
is
an
action
that,
in
effect,
says
i
can't
be
executed
the
way
the
state
intends
to
execute
me,
that
that
has
to
have
been
brought
up
earlier.
justice
scalia
it
has...
has
to
be
under
habeas
rather
than
under
1983.
justice
scalia
well,
but
it's
unlike
these
other
actions
in
this
one
crucial
respect:
its
effect
is
to
prevent
the
execution.
justice
scalia
when
they're
going
to
do
it
is
not
the
issue.
it's
what
they're
going
to
do.
justice
scalia
but
he...
he
knew
that...
that
something
special
had
to
be
done
with
respect
to
him
because
he
had
these
compromised
veins.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
how...
how
long
ago
was
the
conviction
for
which
he
was
condemned
to...
to
death?
justice
scalia
the
crime
was
committed
when?
justice
scalia
well,
what
does
the
statute
say?
it
says
it
has
to
be
not
only
not
previously
ripe...
you
didn't
have
the
information...
but
also
the
statute
says
it
has
to
show
that
he
was
innocent.
justice
scalia
so
why
isn't
that
conclusive
here?
i
mean,
it...
it
doesn't
meet
the
second
condition.
justice
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you
know,
as
you
know,
we've...
we've
turned
down
certiorari
in...
in
these
cases
challenging
the
type
of
drug
used.
what...
what
is
the
difference
between,
you
know,
your
using
a
drug
that's...
that's
going
to
hurt
me
and
your
using
a
catheter
procedure
that's
going
to
hurt
me?
i
don't--
justice
scalia
--they're...
they're
not
challenging
the
method
of
execution.
if
you
want
to
execute
me
by
drugs,
they're
saying,
that's
perfectly
fine,
just
don't
use
a
drug
that
hurts
me.
justice
scalia
and
just
as
here,
you're
saying
if
you
want
to
execute
me
by
lethal
injection,
that's
fine,
just
don't
use
a
manner
of
lethal
injection
that
hurts
me.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
separate
the
two--
justice
scalia
--categories
of
case.
justice
scalia
your...
your
claim
here
is
an
eighth
amendment
claim,
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
justice
scalia
right?
but...
but
you
say
it
just
doesn't
comport
with
what?
the...
the
most
advanced
medical
procedures?
justice
scalia
anything
that
does
not
comport
with
the
most
advanced
medical
procedures
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
know--
justice
scalia
--this
man
is...
is
looking
death
in
the
face.
justice
scalia
and...
and
the
crime
was
committed
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
for
which
he
was...
he
was
condemned.
and...
and
what
he's
really
concerned
about
is...
is
an
incision?
i
find
it
difficult
to
contemplate
that
this
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
justice
scalia
you're
saying
it's...
it's
not
the
eighth
amendment.
you're
saying
it's
a
medical
care
case.
justice
scalia
if
congress
felt
that
way,
they
simply
wouldn't
have
added
the
second
condition.
justice
scalia
they
would
have
just
said
the
facts...
the
factual
predicate
for
the
claim
could
not
have
been
discovered
previously
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
that
describes
a
situation
in
which
there's
no
way
that
the
person
could
have
brought
the
constitutional
claim.
justice
scalia
but
congress
didn't
leave
it
there.
it
went
on
to
add
(ii),
the
facts
underlying
the
claim
would...
would
show
that
the
applicant
is
not
guilty
of
the
underlying
offense.
justice
scalia
the
first
condition
alone:
the
factual
predicate
for
the
claim
could
not
have
been
discovered
previously
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
a
fair
description--
justice
scalia
--of
what
our
prior
second
or
successive
law
was?
justice
scalia
and
congress
rejects
that
by
adding
to
it
a
new...
a
new
number
(ii).
justice
scalia
so
it's
impossible
to
say
that
it
was...
it
was
simply
embracing
our
prior
law.
justice
scalia
the
law
wasn't
changed.
you
just
say
more
time
has
gone
by,
that...
that
he
could
have
brought
a
rule
32
at
the
time,
but
he
can't
now
because
more
time
has
gone
by.
is
that
your
point?
justice
scalia
--but
that's
a
little
different
from
a
case
that
alleges
a
current
impending
constitutional
violation.
