is
that
true
even
if
the
person
who
did
the
harassment
and
so
forth
but
did
not
otherwise
take
a
tangible
action,
was
the
president
of
the
company
and
said...
made
the...
the
workplace
impossible
to
have
it
for
the
employee
and
she
quits.
would
that
be
a
tangible
employment
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
person
who's
a
proxy
does
not
commit
a...
make
a...
a
tangible
decision,
doesn't
fire
her.
he
just
makes
it
impossible
for
her
to
work.
would
that
be
actionable
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
was
a
tangible...
even
though
it
was
a
constructive
discharge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
just
interrupt
there
because
i
want
to
get
one
thing
clear
in
mind?
is
it
your
view
that
the
constructive
discharge
can
only
be
caused
by
a
person
with
the
authority
to
take
a
tangible
employment
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
argument
would
apply
whether...
if
it's
just
coworkers
as
well
as
supervisors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
just
put
the...
a
little
easier
question
for
you.
to
what
extent
in
your
view
is
the...
is
the...
is
it
relevant
that
the
person
who
did
the
harassing
conduct
has
some
status,
enough
authority
to
impose
a
tangible
employment
action?
is...
to
what
extent
is
it
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it's...
but
if
it's
not
such
a
person--
