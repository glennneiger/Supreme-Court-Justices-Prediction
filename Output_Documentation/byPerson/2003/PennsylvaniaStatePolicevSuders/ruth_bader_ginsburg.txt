justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
in
the
third
circuit
because
the
judge
somewhere
in
that
long
opinion
did
say
that
the
evidence
that
she
had
complained...
that
that
would
be
relevant,
but
not
essential
evidence
to
show
the
reasonableness
of
her
reaction
treating
this
conduct
as
a
discharge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought...
i
thought
it
was
stronger
than...
than
that.
it
may
be
different--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
different
places
because
this
opinion
tended
to
say
everything
at
least
twice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
also
to
clarify?
that...
you
gave
justice
o'connor
an
answer
that
surprised
me
because
she
said
let's
stick
to
this
case,
and
she
said
that
action
involving
the
not...
not
letting
her
have
her
papers,
and
then
the
arrest,
that
looking
at
those
facts,
could
that
be...
is
that
the
way
the
court
should
go
about
it.
but
the
district
judge
gave
summary
judgment
for
you
in
this
case.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
then
on
justice
o'connor's
facts,
there
would
be
no
question
whether
she
acted
reasonably,
whether
it
was
equivalent,
whether
it
was
equivalent
to
a
tangible
employment
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
trial.
this
was
just
summary
judgment.
there
was
no
evidence
submitted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no...
no
court
has
rejected
the
constructive
discharge.
the
question
is
how
do
you
define
it.
and
you
said,
in
response
to
justice
souter,
that
it
would
be
fine
if
you
said,
plaintiff,
you're
in
this
situation,
you're
claiming
constructive
discharge,
you
come
in
and...
and,
in
effect,
negate
what
would
otherwise
be
the
affirmative
defenses.
but
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
an...
there's
an
intermediary
situation
and
that's
the
one
where
there
is
a
tangible
action
like
you
get
demoted
or
you
get
transferred
to
a...
a
worse
position.
and
that...
that's
one
category.
another
category
is
you
say
i
was
harassed
constantly
and
that
amounts
to
constructive
discharge.
another
is
they
did
take
a
tangible
action
against
me,
they
didn't
discharge
me,
but
they
were
so
bad
in
harassing
me
and
in
this
demotion,
that
it
amounted
to
a
constructive
discharge.
that...
that
constructive
discharge
is
the
label
used
for
that
too,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
quit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
seventh
circuit
goes
the
other
way
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
follow
what
you
said
even
in
the
context
of
the
facts
here.
you
said
it's
not
the
case
that
there
wasn't...
that
there
was
in
place
a
good
grievance
procedure
and
that
she
availed
herself
of
whatever
she
could
avail
herself
of.
i
think
that's
very
murky
in
this
case.
she
tells
one
story.
the
eeo
officer
tells
another
story,
and
we
don't
know
how
grievances
have
been
handled
in
this
workplace,
whether
it
has
been
effective
for
other
employees
in
the
past.
we
just
don't...
we
have...
how
can
you
make
a
judgment
one
way
or
another
about
the
effectiveness
of
this
grievance
procedure
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that's
now
in
the
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
i
tried
to
suggest
before,
nancy
drew
suders
and
the
head
of
the
equal
employment
gave
different
versions
of
what
happened
in
the...
in
the
only
encounter
that
those
two
had,
which
was
very
far
down
the
road.
so
is
it...
if...
if
the
system
works,
if
there's
ample
notification
of
it...
because
she
went...
the
first...
the
first
episode
suders
says,
i
think
i
may
need
your
help.
nothing
specific
at
all
about
what's
going
on.
and
then
very
far
down
the
road...
one
question
is
did
she
complain
too
late.
what
would
have
happened?
how
would
this...
how
can
she
say
constructive
discharge
or
anything
if,
had
she
been
diligent
about
complaining,
maybe
none
of
this
would
have
happened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
pennsylvania
state
police
against
nancy
drew
suders.
this
case
is
about
an
employer’s
liability
when
supervisor
sexually
harass
subordinate
workers.
our
decision
today
follows
two
1998
decisions
on
that
subject,
burlington
industries
against
ellerth
and
faragher
against
boca
raton.
in
those
decisions
we
delineated
two
categories
of
title
vii
claims
for
sexual
harassment
by
supervisors.
the
first
category
covers
severe
or
pervasive
harassment
that
culminates
in
what
the
case
is
called,
‘a
tangible
employment
action.’
that
means
an
official
action
that
is
reflected
in
the
company’s
records,
a
discharged
demotion
or
severe
cut
in
pay
for
example.
for
actions
of
that
character,
the
court’s
decisions
in
ellerth
and
faragher
hold
that
the
employer
is
strictly
liable,
that
means
the
company
is
liable
with
no
ifs,
ands
or
buts.
the
second
category
involves
harassment
that
goes
on
and
on,
but
has
no
official
marker,
no
discharged,
demotion,
severe
pay
cut
or
other
tangible
action.
in
cases
of
that
order
we
held
in
ellerth
and
faragher,
the
employer
may
raise
an
affirmative
defense
to
liability,
to
prevail
on
the
basis
of
the
defense,
the
employer
must
prove
two
conditions:
first,
that
the
employer
exercise
reasonable
care
to
prevent
and
promptly
correct
any
sexually
harassing
behavior,
and
second
that
the
employee
unreasonably
fail
to
take
advantage
of
the
employer
provided
preventive
or
corrective
opportunities.
these
exacting
conditions
the
court
noted
in
ellerth
and
faragher
are
linked
to
employer’s
effort
to
install
effective
grievance
procedures
and
the
employees
effort
to
use
those
procedures
to
report
and
gain
relief
from
harassing
behavior.
the
court
anticipated
that
the
two
components
of
the
affirmative
defense
would
serve
to
advance
title
vii’s
conciliation
and
deterrence
objectives.
this
case
involves
something
more
than
the
ordinary
sexual
harassment
scenario.
plaintiff
nancy
drew
suders
hired
as
a
police
communications
operator
alleged
that
the
barrage
of
sexual
harassment
to
which
her
supervisors
subjected
her
was
so
constant
and
severe
that
her
quitting
constituted
a
constructive
discharge.
constructive
discharge
is
a
legal
term
that
means,
working
conditions
became
so
dreadful,
one
would
not
expect
a
reasonable
person
to
remain
on
the
job.
our
opinion
addresses
three
questions
about
combined
sexual
harassment
constructive
discharge
claims.
on
employee
entitlement
to
compensation
for
the
alleged
constructive
discharge,
is
the
employer
liable
at
all,
if
so,
is
the
employer
strictly
liable,
or
is
the
employer
liable
but
permitted
to
plead
an
attempt
to
prove
the
affirmative
defense
delineated
in
ellerth
and
faragher?
the
court’s
opinion
confirms
that
title
vii
indeed
does
encompass
constructive
discharge
claims.
to
the
question,
is
the
employer
liable
at
all,
we
answered,
definitively,
yes.
is
the
employer
strictly
liable,
yes
and
no?
yes,
if
a
tangible
employment
action,
for
example
a
humiliating
demotion
caused
the
employee
to
quit,
but
no,
on
strict
liability,
if
such
an
adverse
action
and
is
not
in
the
picture.
harassment
may
indeed
become
unbearable,
even
despite
the
absence
of
a
tangible
act,
like
a
demotion
or
pay
cut,
and
the
employee
may
reasonably
quit
in
response.
but
in
such
cases,
the
employer
does
have
re-cost
to
the
ellerth
and
faragher
affirmative
defense.
the
employer
cannot
avoid
liability
on
showing
both;
that
it
had
installed
a
readily
accessible
and
effective
program
for
reporting
and
resolving
complaints
of
sexual
harassment,
and
that
the
plaintiff
unreasonably
failed
to
avail
herself
of
such
an
employer,
provided
preventive
or
remedial
apparatus.
why
do
we
distinguish
between
quits
prompted
by
an
official
adverse
action
and
quits
not
proceeded
by
such
an
action?
as
ellerth
and
faragher
explained,
the
legal
analysis
is
drawn
from
agency
law.
an
employer
is
liable
for
the
acts
of
its
agents;
here
it’s
supervisors,
when
the
agent
is
significantly
aided
in
his
misdeed
by
the
agency
relationship.
when
a
supervisor
who
is
engaged
in
harassing
conduct
takes
or
instigates
a
tangible
employment
action
against
the
subordinate.
for
example,
suppose
she
is
transferred
to
a
lower
level
with
lower
pay,
that
act,
the
transfer,
will
be
reflected
in
the
company’s
records
in
effecting
such
a
tangible
change
in
an
employer’s
workstation
or
situation,
the
supervisor
beyond
question
is
aided
by
the
agency
relationship.
in
contrast,
when
a
supervisor’s
harassment
does
not
culminated
in
any
official
adverse
action,
it
is
less
certain
that
the
agency
relation
is
the
driving
force.
that
uncertainty
and
nothing
on
the
record,
indicating
that
the
employee
was
not
a
voluntary
quit,
justify
affording
the
employer
the
chance
to
establish
through
the
double
headed
affirmative
defense
that
it
should
not
be
held
vicariously
liable.
in
the
instant
case,
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
held
that
any
constructive
discharge
triggers
strict
liability,
whether
or
not
an
official
adverse
action
occurred,
because
that’s
what's
reasoning,
is
inconsistent
with
the
line
we
drew
in
ellerth
and
faragher.
we
vacate
the
third
circuit’s
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
