justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
thought
the
first...
the
last
thing
you
said
i
thought
is
already
there
in
ellerth,
either
at
least
your
tangible
discharge
or
it
doesn't
or
does.
you
have
to
show,
you
know,
that
they
were
reasonable
in
not
making...
take
advantage
of
a...
of
a
complaint
procedure,
and
insofar
as
it
doesn't,
ellerth
already
says
that
there's
a...
there's
an
affirmative
defense
and
we
had
a
reasonable
complaint
procedure
in
place.
so
i
don't
really
see
that
problem.
nor
do
i
see
the
problem
with
the
third
circuit.
the
third
circuit
says
working
conditions
were
intolerable,
so
intolerable
a
reasonable
person
would
have
concluded
there
was
no
other
choice
but
to
resign.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
isn't
it
the
same?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
that
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
part
i
don't
understand
is
when
you
say
they
are
precluded
from
using
a...
a
corrective
opportunity,
a
preventive
or
corrective
opportunity
because
they
have
been
fired.
i
think...
doesn't
that
beg
the
question?
imagine
an
employer
who
has
notices
in
print
4
inches,
black
print
all
over
the
place
pasted.
if
anyone
here
creates
a
hostile
work
environment,
threatens
you
in
any
way,
does
anything,
i
want
you
to
phone
this
emergency
number
immediately
24
hours
a
day,
and
we
will
correct
it.
and...
and
the...
the
employee,
who
is
totally
not
blind,
in
fact
teaches
a
class
that
that's
what
they're
supposed
to
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
now
is
subject
to
terrible
harassment,
but
does
not
avail
herself
of
those
procedures
for
no
understandable
reason.
has
that
employee
made
out
a
claim
of
constructive
discharge?
of
course,
i
think
obviously,
the
answer
is
no,
she
hasn't.
now
i
want
to
know
what
you
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
fine.
now,
and
if
i
am
correct,
if
you
believe
i
am
correct--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--doesn't
the
argument
in
this
case
simply
disappear?
because
all
you
have
to
say
is
there
is
no
constructive
discharge
as
long
as
there
was
a
preventive
or
corrective
opportunity
in
place
and
the
employee
was
unreasonable
in
failing
to
take
advantage
thereof.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
the
employee
was
reasonable
in
not
taking
advantage,
she's
constructively
discharged.
but
if
she's
unreasonable,
she
is
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
whole
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
and
if
the
traumatized
employee
by
the
judge
or
jury
is
determined
to
have
been
reasonable,
she
wins.
but
if
she's
unreasonable,
she
loses
like
any
other
reasonable
person
test
in
the
law.
what's
the
problem
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
of
course,
i'm
saying
the
affirmative
defense
is
not
available
because
there's
no
need
for
it.
that's
what
we've
been
talking
about,
i
thought,
the
last
half
hour.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
do
you
win
this
case,
by
the
way?
because
the...
the
third
circuit
seemed
to
say,
as
i
read
it,
that
in
not
taking
advantage
of
the
available
opportunities,
your
client
was
reasonable.
in
other
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
what
the
third
circuit
said?
