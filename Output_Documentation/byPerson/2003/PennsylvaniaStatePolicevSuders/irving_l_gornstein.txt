mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
employer
is
strictly
liable
for
a
constructive
discharge
in
any
harassment
that
has
preceded
it
only
when
the
constructive
discharge
comes
about
as
a
result
of
an
official
company
act,
such
as
a
demotion.
if
the
constructive
discharge
comes
about
as
a
result
of
a
supervisor's
creation
of
a
hostile
environment,
then
the
employer
has
an
affirmative
defense
and
can
show
that
the
plaintiff
unreasonably
bypassed
available
opportunities
for
correction.
now,
the
requirement
of
an
official
company
act
as
a
predicate
for
strict
liability
comes
from
the
court's
decision
in
ellerth
and
is
supported
by
two
important
considerations.
first,
a
company
act
is
the
kind
of
act
that
is
likely
to
be
documented
and
subject
to
higher
levels
of
review,
and
so
it's
the
kind
of
act
over
which
the
employer
can
exert
the
most
control.
and
that
heightened
potential
to
control
makes
it
fair
to
hold
the
employer
strictly
liable,
even
if
in
a
particular
case
the
employer
would
otherwise
be
able
to
show
that
it
acted
reasonably
and
the
plaintiff
did
not.
it...
it...
second
of
all,
furthering
title
vii's...
the...
recognizing
the
affirmative
defense
when
there's
not
an
official
company
act,
furthers
title
vii's
prophylactic
purposes
because
it
gives
the
employer
an
extra
incentive
to
create
policies
that
will
help
to
prevent
discrimination
from
occurring
in
the
first
place
and
it
gives
employees
an
added
incentive
to
complain
before
problems
become
title
vii
violations.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
in
this...
in
this
case
you
might
want
to...
what
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
say
is
you
might
want
to
initially
decide
the
logically
antecedent
question
of
what
it
takes
to...
to
make
out
a
constructive
discharge
claim
in
the
first
place.
and
if
you
did
that,
you
should
say
that
to
prove
constructive
discharge,
a
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
there's
no
reasonable
other
alternative
other
than
to
resign.
and
a
plaintiff
who
has
unreasonably
bypassed
an
available
opportunity
for
correction
can't
make
out
a
constructive
discharge
claim
in
the
first
place.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that...
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
souter,
you
are
right
with
respect
to
the
constructive
discharge
claim
itself;
that
is,
proving
the
constructive
discharge
will
necessarily
negate
the
affirmative
defense
to
the
constructive
discharge
claim.
but
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--because
it
doesn't
necessarily
negate...
proving
the
constructive
discharge
doesn't
necessarily
negate
the
affirmative
case...
defense
to
the
claim
of
a
hostile
work
environment
that
preceded
the
constructive
discharge.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
let
me
try
to
explain
to
you
how
this
could
come
up.
you
could
have
a
situation
in
which
at
the
moment
of
resignation,
the
plaintiff
was
reasonable
in
believing
that
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
other
than
to
resign
and
reasonable
in
bypassing
the
available
procedures
at
the
moment
of
resignation,
therefore,
could
prove
a
constructive
discharge.
but
it
may
have
been
the
case
that
at
a
prior
point
in
time,
she
would
have
been
unreasonable
in
failing
to
complain
about
the
harassment
and
therefore
be
vulnerable
to
the
affirmative
defense
on
the
hostile
environment
claim
even
though
she's
proven
her
constructive
discharge.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the...
the
way
that
she
would
get
to
the
point
that
i
described,
justice
souter,
is
if
you
had
an
escalating
kind
of
harassment
and
at
the
last
act
of
harassment,
it
would
have
been
reasonable
that...
for
the
plaintiff
to
leave
at
that
point...
let
us
say
the
supervisor
does
a
lot
of
things,
and
then
on
the
last
act
says,
if
you
come
back
tomorrow,
you're
dead.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
souter,
it
would
be
a
simpler
system,
but
the...
the
system
we
are
proposing
really
is
just
superimposing
on
this
problem
the
same
structure
the
court
created
in
ellerth
and
faragher.
the
court
could
have
devised
a
simpler
rule
in
ellerth
and
faragher.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well--
[laughter]
i'm
saying
that
the
court
took
into
account
various
competing
considerations
in...
in
structuring
it,
and
it
made
for
a
somewhat
more
complicated
scheme.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we
would
say
that
you
would
remand
because
it
is
possible
that
there
is
a...
an
official
company
act
that
caused
the
constructive
discharge.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
to
wit,
the
sequence
of
events
leading
up
to
the
arrest,
and
that
the
arrest
might
be...
we're
not
saying
that
it
is...
but
it
might
be
an
official
company
act.
if
it
is
and
the
plaintiff
could
show
that
that
act
left
her
with
no
reasonable
alternative
other
than
to
resign,
you
would
have
a
constructive
discharge
that
leads
to
strict
liability.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
could
be
an
official
company
if
it
is
only
the
sort
of
thing...
if
it
depends
on
a
grant
of
authority
from
the
employer
to
the
supervisor
and
it's
only
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
supervisor
could
do.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it
could
be
that
you're
right
about
that,
but
it
also
may
be
that
it's
the
type
of
action
where
the...
the
person
was
wearing
both
hats,
as
a
supervisor
and
as
a
law
enforcement
officer,
and
that
it
was
the...
only
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
supervisor
could
have
done.
and
all
we're
saying
is
that
should
be
fleshed
out.
if
you
don't
think
that
should
be
fleshed
out,
if
the
court
didn't
think
that
that
was
a
possibility,
then
there
wouldn't
be
the
need
for
the...
the
remand.
you
could
just
decide
it
without
a
remand
and...
and
reverse
on
the
grounds...
to
get
back
to
justice
souter's
point,
you
still,
under
my
scenario
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
a
constructive
discharge
is
a
tangible
employment
action.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--then
in
that
situation,
there's
a
constructive
discharge,
but
there's
a
potential
defense
to
the
harassment
claim
that
would
depend
on
whether
the
constructive
discharge
is
itself
a
tangible
employment
action.
it
only
is
a
tangible
employment
action
if
it's
brought
about
by
an
official
company
act,
such
as
a
demotion.
if
it's
not
brought
about
by
an
official
company
act,
then
the
affirmative...
no
affirmative
defense
for
the
constructive
discharge
because
that's
been
negated
by
proving
constructive
discharge.
but
there
is
affirmative
defense
for
the
prior
acts
leading
up
to
it
that
are
framed
as
a
claim
about
hostile
environment.
there
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
hostile
environment
claim
if
the
hostile
environment
culminates
in
a
constructive
discharge
that's
not
effected
by
an
official
company
act.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
may
i
answer,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
the...
what's
that's
missing
is
there
is
that
ellerth
requires
an
official
company
act
to
have
a
tangible
employment
action
as
a...
not
just
a
change
in
status
from
being
employed
to
not
being
employed.
and
if
there's
not
an
official
company
act,
then
the
employer
has
the
affirmative
defense.
