justice
david
h.

is
there...
is
there...
you...
you
say
the...
the
standards
vary.
is
there
any
jurisdiction
that...
for
a...
that
recognizes
constructive
discharge
that
does
not
require
the
employee
to
prove
that
the
employee
acted
reasonably
in
relation
to
avenues
for
redress,
filing
grievances
and
so
on?
is...
is
there
any...
is
there
any
jurisdiction
in
which
the
employee's
reasonableness
in
trying
to
adjust
things
before
leaving
is
not
an
element
of
the...
of
the
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no
please.
i
was...
why
isn't
the
way
to
simplify
the
problem
and
decide
this
case
for
us
to
say
in
order
to
have
constructive
discharge,
there
has
got
to
be
the
element
that
justice
kennedy
just
described,
i.e.,
avenues
of
redress,
reasonableness
on
the
part
of
the
employee
in
availing
or
perhaps
in
some
cases
not
availing
of
them?
if
that
element
is
shown,
then
there
is
no
point
in
recognizing
the
affirmative
defense
because
that
is
in
pretty
clear
contradiction
to
one
element
of
the
affirmative
defense.
and...
and
that
would
make
for
a
fairly
simple
body
of
law.
why...
why
isn't
that
the
appropriate
way
for
us
to
go?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you...
when
you
posit
that
reasonableness
requirement,
i
take
it
you...
you
mean
to
include
that
the
employee
must
show
either
that
the
employee
reasonably
availed
herself
or
himself
of
whatever
grievance
procedure
there
was
or
at
least
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
not
doing
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
if...
if
you
do
that,
what
is...
what
is
left
of
the
affirmative
defense,
whether
there
was...
whether
there
was
a
supervisor
involved
or
not,
because
the
affirmative...
as
i
understand
the
affirmative
defense,
the
affirmative
defense
is
inconsistent
with
that
showing?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
don't
we
stop
right
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
hostile
work
environment
claim...
and
if...
if
we're
going
to
recognize
constructive
discharge,
hostile
work
environment
i...
i
presume
has
been
subsumed
under
constructive
discharge
because
constructive
discharge
says,
hostile
environment
plus
something
more.
and
we've
been
describing
the
plus
something
more.
and...
and
in
order
to
prove
the
plus
something
more,
you've
got
to
prove,
as
you
said,
something
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
affirmative
defense.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
what
you're...
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
i...
i
would
suppose
that
if...
if
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was...
that
there
was
a
point
at
which
she
could
have
resolved
this
or
at
least
a
point
at
which
it
would
have
been
reasonable
to
pursue
grievances
and
so
on
to
resolve
it,
and
she
didn't
do
it,
that
she's
going
to
lose.
in
other
words,
if...
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
see
how
she's
going
to
get
to
the
point
that
you
describe.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
see
your
point.
i...
i
have
one
question
in
response
to
the
point,
and
that
is,
if...
if
we...
if
we
construct
a
system
that...
that
recognizes
the
possibility
that...
that
you
just
described,
are
we
going
to
have
a
system
that
is
just
so
darned
complicated
that
it's
going
to
be
too
difficult
to
administer?
in
other
words,
every
case
is
going
to
involve
allegations
of
what
you
just
say,
denials
of
those
allegations.
in
order
to
have
an
administrable
system,
shouldn't
we
simply
say
that
if
you
can
prove
the
constructive
discharge,
if
the...
if
the
element
includes
the
unreasonableness
on
grievance,
no
affirmative
defense,
and
just
get
over
with
it
simply
because
otherwise
it
would
be
just
too
complicated
a
system?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
it's
my
fault.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
may...
may
i
interrupt
you
with...
with
this
question
because
it
goes
to
justice
scalia's
question?
isn't...
for
the
reason
you
just
gave,
isn't
the
reason
that
the
claim
goes
from
a
hostile
environment
for
which
there's
a
defense
to
constructive
discharge
for
which
there
isn't
a
defense...
isn't
the
reason
that
in
order
to
get
from
hostile
environment
to
constructive
discharge,
the
employee
has
to
prove
something
that
she
didn't
have
to
prove
merely
for
hostile
environment?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
is
the
element...
we're...
we're
assuming.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
the
element
that
she
either
reasonably
availed
herself
of...
of
the...
of
grievance
mechanisms
or
was
reasonable
in
not
doing
so.
and
that's
the
element
that
gets
her
to
the
more
serious
claim,
and
it's
also
the
element
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
affirmative
defense.
is...
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
tell
me...
tell
me
why
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
