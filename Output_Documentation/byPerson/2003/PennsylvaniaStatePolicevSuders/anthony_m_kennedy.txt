anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
finish
your
answer?
i...
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we're
back
before
the
summary
judgment
stage
and
you're
telling
the
trial
court
what
the
theory
of
the
case
should
be.
would
your
theory
be
something
like
this?
whether
we
use
the
phrase,
constructive
discharge
or
tangible
employment
action...
and
we
have
to
use
some
phrase
because
the
law
works
with
labels...
we're
interested
in
the
practical
aspects
of...
of
these
cases,
and
one
of
them
is
this.
were
there
avenues
of
redress?
and
if
the
employer
was...
employee
was
unreasonable
in
not
following
these
avenues
of
redress,
then
there
can
be
no
constructive
discharge
or
tangible
employment
action.
is
that
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
sounds
like
a
good
position.
why
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
that
different
from
the
formulation
that
one
component
in
almost
all
cases
of
constructive
discharge
or
tangible
employment
action,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
is
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
avenues
for
redress,
and
if
they
did
exist,
whether
the
employee
took
reasonable
steps
to
follow
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
the
tangible
employment
action...
say,
a
demotion
or
an
arrest
or
a
firing...
could
have
been
avoided
if
the
employee
had
been
prompt
and
reasonable
in
pursuing
avenues
for
relief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
a
reasonable
employee
in
that
position
would
have
done
that
and
they
didn't
do
it.
then
it
escalates.
then
there's
the
discharge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
availability
of
avenues
of
redress
and...
coupled
with
a
showing
that
there
was
no
pursuit
of
those
reasonable
avenues
of
redress,
is...
are
those
components
or
facts
relevant
to
determining
constructive
discharge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
we're
not
arguing
about
very
much.
justice
souter
says
the
constructive
discharge
is
then
inconsistent.
maybe
another
characterization
would
be
superfluous.
i
mean,
the
reasonable...
the
reasonable
attempts
to
obtain
redress
is
inconsistent.
i...
i
think
maybe
superfluous.
what
are
we
arguing
about
here?
not
very
much.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
as
hard
to
figure
out
as
constructive
discharge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it...
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
that...
that
both
sides
point
the
finger
at
the
other
and
say
you're
using
labels.
your...
your
brief
says
a
constructive
discharge
is
a
tangible
employment
action.
and
i...
and
i
assume
you
argue
that
there's
no
affirmative
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the...
the
label
is
of...
of
immense
importance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
depending
on...
depending--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the...
the
question
is,
what
does
it
consist
of?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that's
true...
if
that's
true,
the
case
has
to
go
back.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
like
you
always
do
in
the
law.
it's
a
question
of
reasonableness.
