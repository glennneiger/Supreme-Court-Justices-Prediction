mr.
donald
a.
bailey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
pursuant
to
title
vii,
the
general
rule
has
been
is
that
employers
are
liable
for
the
discriminatory
acts
of
their
supervisors.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
constructive
discharge
is
the
equivalent
of
a
formal
discharge.
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
in
dealing
with
the
law
that
we're
addressing
today
is
one
of
semantics.
a
formal
discharge
is
the
equivalent
of
a
constructive
discharge
by
definition.
it
is
a...
it
is
a
matter
of
methodology.
the
united
states
and
the
petitioner
would
have
this
court
define
the
culpability
of
the
employer
for
the
supervisor's
acts
as
a
matter
of
official
act.
that
leads
this
court
down
an
incredibly
complex
road
of...
of
definitional
problems.
if
the
court
goes
back
to
meritor,
the
chief
justice's
opinion,
where
the
court
held
clearly
there
is
no
automatic
liability
for
the
employer's
being
responsible
for
the
wayward
acts,
clearly
outside
the
scope
of
employment,
clearly
not
authorized,
but
we're
not
going
to
find
a...
a...
an
automatic
liability.
what
the
united
states
wants
to
do
and
why
the
respondent
believes
that
the
third
circuit...
that
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
properly
is
to
devise
a
general
rule
and
underline
if
proven,
if
the
constructive
discharge
is
proven,
then
the
obvious
occurs.
it's
a
tangible
employment
action.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
well,
it's...
it's
the...
to
go
back
to
some
of
the
questions
that
justice
souter
was...
souter
was
raising,
the
issue
of
the...
of
the
constructive
discharge,
when
proven,
reaches
a
point
as
a
practical
matter
in
litigation
that
the
affirmative
defense
is
no
longer
viable.
and
the
issue
in
the
question
presented
is
when
a...
if...
if
we
stick
to
that
issue,
is
that
is
a
constructive
discharge
a
tangible
employment
action.
conversely,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
constructive
discharge,
if
proven,
is
an
official
company
act?
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
your
honor,
i
believe...
justice
scalia,
i
believe
the...
the...
you
can
sue
the
employer.
the
issue...
and
that's...
that's
the
hostile
work
environment
claim
that...
that
this
court
was
really
addressing
in
faragher.
the
issue
becomes--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--well,
the
case
would
then
become
a
hostile
work
environment
case.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
there
would
not
be
a
tangible
employment
action.
this...
the...
the
employee
can
still
sue.
the
issue
then
becomes
that
the
affirmative
defense
is
available.
the
issue
here
is
the
affirmative
defense
is
not
available.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
okay.
i...
i
don't
think
it's...
it's
a
situation
where
the
employer
is
not
responsible.
it's
that
the
employer
has
mechanisms
available
to...
if
proven,
again,
if...
if
they
can
prevail
on
the
affirmative
defense
to
counteract
the
charges
of
hostile
workplace
harassment.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
no,
your--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--no.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
it's...
it's
putting
cart
before
the
horse.
it's
taking
the
burden
that
this
court
carved
out
in
faragher
and
ellerth
and
it's
putting
a
burden
on
the
employee
which,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
employee
has
to
carry
anyway
in
proving
the
constructive
discharge.
we
are
back
at
the
original
question
that
you
asked.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
and...
and
we're
back
where
the
third
circuit
in
its...
in
its
opinion
underlined
if
proven,
held
that
if
the
constructive
discharge...
if
the
constructive
discharge
is
proven,
the
affirmative
defense...
and
even
the...
the
united
states
admits
this...
is
in
all
likelihood
not
a
cogent
defense
at
that
point,
the
constructive
discharge
has
been
proven.
that's--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--yes,
they
are
relevant
in
this
sense.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
i
respectfully
disagree.
justice
kennedy,
in
the
process
of
proving
the
constructive
discharge,
the
salient
factual
issues
that
by
implication
you
refer
to
are
going
to
arise.
the
employer
is
going
to
have
an
opportunity
in...
in
the
real
case
in
controversy
in
the
district
court
or
during
litigation
and
discovery
of
addressing
issues
and
answering
questions
about...
and
this
is
where
we
get
into
a
great
difficulty
with
the
position
of
the
united
states.
you
know,
when
does
the
employee...
when
does
the
employee
have
a
responsibility
to
come
forward?
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
justice
scalia--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--justice
scalia,
it
begs
a
multitude
of
questions.
those
questions
relate...
and
they're
probative.
they're
of
probative
value
in
any
litigation.
and
they
relate
to
how
that...
that
scheme,
that
remedial
scheme,
the
internal,
private
remedial
scheme,
how
it
is
enforced,
how
it's
policed.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
what...
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--it's
relevant
and
it's
probative
in
the
conduct
of
the
case,
but
it's
not
dispositive
of
a...
of
a
constructive
discharge
being--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--being
a
tangible
employment
action.
the
relevant
facts...
the
employee's
conduct
is
always
going
to
be
a
relevant
fact
situation
for
a
jury
or
a
court
sitting
as
a
fact
finder
to
hear,
to
contemplate,
and
understand.
there
are
issues--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--as
a
matter
of
law,
it
dispenses
with
the
definition
that
set
this
court
on
the
road
to
meritor
and
ellerth
and
faragher,
and
that
is
the
definition
of
an
employer
in
title
vii
law.
of
course,
it's
the
employer's
act,
if
it's
an
official
act,
and
if
there
are
issues
that
are--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--to
the
extent
the...
how
do
we
define
the
employer?
the
board
of--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--justice
scalia,
i...
i
may
not...
i
may
not
be
understanding
your
point.
i
apologize
for
that.
but
if
i
do...
if
i
do
understand
it
correctly,
we
are
now
down
the
road
embarking
into
a
multitude
of
definitions
of
what
the
employer
is,
while
in
reality
to
an
employee
in
the
workplace,
invariably
the
employer
is
that
immediate
supervisor
who,
as
described
in...
in
faragher
and
ellerth,
has
the
power
to
make
those
tangible
employment
decisions.
and
to
that
employee--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--no.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
no.
[laughter]
i...
i
think...
i
think
it
can
be
both.
i
think,
as
correctly
defined
by
this
court
previously,
there
are
certainly
situations
where
by
negligence...
in
fact,
the
law
of
constructive
discharge
across
the
length
and
breadth
of
our
country
does
include
the
reality
that
there
are
circumstances
where
there's
ratification
by
omission,
acquiescence
and
negligence--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--of
the
acts
of...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
it's...
it's
relevant
to
the
extent
of
imputing
that
responsibility
to
the
broader
employer,
the
supervisor
in
other
words.
it's
relevant.
but--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
i
think
in--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--well,
i...
i
think
in...
as
i
understand
the
original
question,
we're
referring
to
a
coworker-induced
discharge,
let's
say,
or...
or
involuntary
quitting.
and
in
that
case,
justice
scalia,
i...
i
believe
you...
you
are
certainly
pointing
at
something
here
because
the
standards
of
proof
factually
and
perhaps
legally
are
different.
they
still
go,
however,
at
their
core
to
the
conduct
and
actions
of
the
supervisor.
now,
unquestionably,
the
supervisor...
the
supervisor's
actions
are
not
authorized
by
the
employer.
clearly
they're
not.
the
imputation
that
the
congress
made
of
employer
liability
for
agent
actions
was
a
policy
consideration
goal
and
this
worked,
in
an
effort
to
balance
judgments
and
to
balance
realities
in
the
workplace
and
achieve
justice
in
terms
of
what
is
fair
if
you
have
that
hardworking
employer
who
works
very,
very
arduously
at
structuring
a
workplace
program
and
enforces
it...
not
the
case
here...
but
enforces
it
and
follows
through
with
it,
there
should
be
some
recognition,
some
issue
of
mitigation.
and
under
those
circumstances,
of
course,
depending
upon
what
the
trial
court
finds
and...
and
depending
upon
how
this
court
decides
that
constructive
discharge
if
it
is
a
tangible
employment
action,
how...
what
role
it
plays
and
what...
what
the
demands
or
requirements
this
court
would
have
in
title
vii
situations
so
that...
so
that...
the
official
act,
which
the
government
would
say
is
not
a
tangible
employment
action,
in
reality
has
to
be.
it's
a
semantic
distinction
without
a
difference.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
justice
ginsburg,
you
are
correct
in
the
sense
that
the
facts
of
the
record
reflect
that
the
employee,
nancy
suders,
went
to
the...
the
top
dog
in
the
pennsylvania
state
police
in
the
affirmative
action
and
discriminatory
area,
as
a
result
of
education
she
received
on
a
test...
in
a
seminar
taught
by
that
person
and
because
she
could
not
locate
an
appropriate
form.
now,
technically
speaking...
technically
speaking...
and
the
district
court
didn't
even
get
into
this,
but
to
do
fair
and
honest
response
to
your
question,
nancy
suders
did
not
go
and
acquire
the
exact
form.
she
could
not
find
it.
she
couldn't
locate
it.
it
wasn't
posted.
the
record
will
indicate
that
in
fact
nancy
drew
suders
did
complain.
that
complain
found...
complaint
found
its
way
to
the
bureau
of...
of
the
iad,
you
know,
where
they...
they
look
at
professional
responsibility.
she
didn't
have
the
correct
form,
quote/unquote,
according
to
the
record.
now,
if
that's
not
availing
herself...
that's
a
factual
determination
that
has
to
be
made
either
as
part
of
a...
a
decision
at
law
by
the
court
as
to
whether
a
constructive
discharge
has
been
proven.
and
i
assume
in
the
litigation
process
at
some
point
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
look
at
that
record,
is
going
to
look
at
what
is
presented.
they're
going
to
be
considered...
considering
points
of
charge
and
a
motion
by
the
defendant
to...
to
be
given
permission
to
present
an
affirmative
defense.
to
go
back
to
what
the
government
even
admits,
in
many
circumstances...
and
to
questions
that
were
raised
by...
by
other
justices
here,
in
many
circumstances
the...
there
will
be
no
affirmative
defense
available
because
the
constructive
discharge
will
have
been
proven.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
facts
in
this
case,
nancy
drew
suders...
and
i
think
this
is
what
offended
the
sensibilities
of
the
third
circuit,
and...
and...
and
the
third
circuit
said
that
even--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--legal
sensibilities,
justice
rehnquist...
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
well--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--justice
kennedy--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--yes.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
yes,
it
is.
the
label...
and...
and
you
made
reference
in
earlier
arguments
this
issue
of
label--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--legal
labels--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--well--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--well,
it's
an
objective
person
test.
the
employee
has
got
to
prove
that
the
harassment
was
so
intense
and
intolerable--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--i...
i
believe
that
the
remedial
scheme
is
not
relevant
for
two
reasons.
the
remedial
scheme
is
not
relevant
because
the
employee
cannot
avail
themselves
of
the
procedures
in
a
procedural
due
process
sense
of
a
in-place
employer
remedial
scheme
because
they
are,
in
the
case
of
a
formal
discharge,
fired,
in
the
case
of
a
constructive
discharge,
precluded
because
they
are
really
fired.
formal
discharge
equals
constructive
discharge
equals
official
act.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
yes.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
i...
i
believe
that
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
you're
correct.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
and
that's--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--i...
i--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--i...
i...
that
part
is
correct.
i...
i
believe
your--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--well,
i
believe
your
analysis
is
erroneous
until
when
what
is
brought
into
what's
actually
going
to
occur
is
an
application
of
the
reasonable
person
standard.
your
hypothetical
quite
clearly
would
put
a
horrendous
burden
on
an
employee
unless
perhaps
that
employee
is
so
traumatized,
they
don't
have
any
faith
in
those
great
big
4-inch
black
letters.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
assuming
that
what
has
occurred
in
that
process
is
we've
reached
a
hiatus
where
the
employee
has
either
proven
the
constructive
discharge,
the
issue
then
becomes
what
the
issue
in
this
case
is.
the
affirmative
defense
is
then
not
available.
we've
reached
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
your
honor,
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
my...
my
client's
actions
were
reasonable.
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
that
was
the
third
circuit
conclusion,
that
my
client
indeed
did
act
reasonable
or...
or
at
very
best,
when
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment,
there
was
a
disputed
material
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
plan
that
was
in
effect
and
nancy
drew
suders
took
advantage
of
it.
and
then
the
court--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--i
disagree.
i...
i
was
going
to
conclude,
if...
if
i
may,
justice
kennedy.
then
the
court
says...
and
they
use
the
word...
let's
look
at
the
last
day.
if
there's
any
question,
let's
look
at
the
last
day.
and
if
we
look
at
the
last
day,
nancy
drew
suders
is
brought
in.
the
bathroom,
the
toilet
seat,
the
handle,
everything
is
dusted
with
stuff...
powder.
her
test
results
are
taken.
they're
stuffed
in
the
lingerie
drawer.
nancy
suders
happens
to
find
them.
they
set
the
room
up,
and
nancy
suders
is
brought
in
and
her
hands
are
photographed
and
she's
read
her
rights.
and
she's
called
a
thief
repeatedly
and
she's
told
she
can't
leave.
and
then
finally,
hands
shaking,
having
drafted
a
resignation
letter,
she
presents
it.
so
until
the
last
day,
which
is
where
the
hypothetical
i
was
left
with
ended,
it
might
be
arguable
that
nancy
drew
suders...
if
we
want
to
craft
a
rule
which
says...
and
we...
and
if
it's
possible
to
do...
which
says
there
is
some
point
in
time
where
the
burden
arises
for
the
employee
to
take
a
countermeasure
or
counteraction,
when
is
that?
how
do
we
do
that?
how
can
we
craft
a
general
rule
that
way?
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
i...
i
agree.
and
in
this
case
nancy
drew
suders
did
every
conceivable
thing
that
an
employee
could
do,
including
contacting
the
head
of
the
affirmative
action
in
the
department--
mr.
donald
a.
bailey
--well,
the
facts
in
the
case
would
indicate
that
she
complained
not
only
to
virginia
smith-elliot
who
blew
her
off...
by
the
way,
she
only
worked
there
for
5
months.
she
complained
to
a
state
senator.
she
did
everything.
she
went
looking
for
help.
she
was
frightened.
she
could
do
nothing
at
this
rural
barracks
at
this
station.
the
issue
then
becomes,
in
terms
of...
of
if...
if
we're
looking
at
her
actions
in
terms...
in
a
context
of
did
she
take...
did
she
assume
that
employee
burden
of
reasonably
responding,
putting
all
of
those
things
together,
that's
where
the
third
circuit
i
think
correctly
analyzed
that
there...
that
that
nancy
drew
suders
acted
reasonably.
she
was
subjected
to
horrendous
conditions
at
work.
she
did
go
elsewhere
to
complain.
she
complained
to
virginia
smith-elliot.
it's...
the
difference
is
