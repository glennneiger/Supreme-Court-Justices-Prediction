mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
its
decisions
a
few
years
ago
in
the
ellerth
and
faragher
cases,
this
court
held
that
where
a
supervisor
has
created
a
hostile
work
environment
by
acts
of
sexual
harassment,
the
liability
of
the
employer
is
not
strict,
but
rather
is
subject
to
an
affirmative
defense
which
centers
around
the
opportunities
provided
by
the
employer
for
corrective
or
preventive
action.
the
question
here
is
whether
that
affirmative
defense
should
continue
to
be
available
where
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
hostile
work
environment
resulted
in
a
constructive
discharge,
and
we
submit
that
it
should.
in
our
view
there
is
nothing
about
a
claim
of
constructive
discharge
that
changes
the
ellerth-faragher
analysis
of
hostile
work
environments.
a
supervisor's
acts
which
create
a
hostile
work
environment
don't
produce
strict
liability
because
they
are
not
acts
of
agency;
that
is,
they
are
not
the
acts
of
the
employer.
they
don't
bear
the
imprimatur
of
the
employer.
they
aren't
ratified
by
the
employer,
and
they
are
not
the
sorts
of
things
which
could
only
be
done
by
somebody
invoking
the
authority
of
the
employer.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
yes.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
justice...
justice
o'connor,
if
we
haven't
made
this
clear,
then
the
court
has
my
sincerest
apologies
because
that
is
exactly
what
we
suggest
the
court
should
do.
if
the
underlying
actions
of
the
supervisor
amounted...
which...
which
provoked
the
constructive
discharge
amounted
to
a
tangible
employment
action,
then
there
is
no
affirmative
defense.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
i'm
not
sure
if
it
would
be
tangible
action
or
not,
but
it
would
certainly
indicate
that
if
the
employer
didn't
respond,
that
it
was
in
some
sense
ratifying
or
approving
what
it
has
done.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
that,
justice
scalia,
is
partly
true
and
it
partly
is
not
true
because
the
precise
elements
of
what
you
need
to
prove
to...
to
get
a
constructive
discharge
vary
quite
widely
from
court
to
court.
and
in
some
courts
what
you
say
is
quite
accurate.
there
has
to
be
some
proof
of
an
intention
on
the
part
of
the
employer,
even
if
it's
only
through
a
failure
to
respond
to
a
complaint,
to
get
rid
of
the
employee.
but
in
other
courts...
and...
and
this
includes
the
third
circuit...
that
is
not
really
the
case.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
i
think
it
ought--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--well,
that's
not
a
question
that
we've
presented
or
that
the
court
has
addressed.
in...
in
our
view,
the
right
answer
to
that
would
be,
yes,
you
have
to
in
some
sense
prove
employer
intent--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--i
think
that
the
short
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
there
are
such
jurisdictions
and
they
include
the
third
circuit,
but
i
need
to
be
a
little
more
expansive
than
that
because
in
all
jurisdictions,
including...
including
the
third
circuit,
there
is
an
inquiry
into
whether
the
employee
acted
reasonably,
but...
and
in
some
jurisdictions,
that
inquiry
is
directed
to...
to
the
question
of
whether
the
employee
tried
to
resolve
this...
this
matter
internally.
in
other
jurisdictions,
including
the...
the
third
circuit,
the
inquiry
into
employee
reasonableness
is
tied
only
to
the
question
of
how
bad
were
the
conditions;
that
is,
were
these
conditions
so
bad
that
a
reasonable
person
would
quit?
and
in
that
inquiry,
it
may
or
may
not
even
be
relevant
whether
the
employee
tried
to...
to
resolve
it
internally.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
i'm
not
sure
the
court
went
that
far.
the
court
said
that...
that
it
might
conceivably
be
relevant
and
in...
in
a
later--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--and
it...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
my
recollection
is
that
the
court
didn't
give
very
much
specific
direction
on
what
should
come
in
on
a
remand
in
this
case.
as
a
general
matter,
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
clear
that
it
was
up
to
district
courts
to
decide
whether
all,
some,
or
none
of
evidence
about
anti-harassment
policies
and
remedial
efforts
should
come
in.
and
that--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
if...
if
i
could.
and
that
inquiry,
in
turn,
is
tied
simply
into
the
question
of
how
bad
were
the
conditions.
that
is,
if
the
conditions
were
bad
enough,
it
doesn't
matter
if
there
was
an
anti-harassment
policy.
it
doesn't
matter
if
there
were
remedial
efforts
made.
so
the...
the
inquiry,
while
it
all
is...
while
it
is
all...
while
it
is
always
phrased
in
terms
of
employee
reasonableness,
can
really
be
directed
to
quite
different
things.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
in
terms
of
this
particular
case,
in
our
view
it
is
a
little
bit...
it...
it
is
too
late
in
the
day
to
reopen
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
underlying
actions
of
the
supervisors
were
or
were
not
tangible.
that...
that
is
something
that
should
have
been
raised
at
the
district
court
level
when
we
raised
the
affirmative
defense.
what
i...
what
i--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--there...
well,
there
was
no
trial.
there
was
certainly
evidence
submitted,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
when
we
as
the
defendants
say
we
are
entitled
to
the
affirmative
defense
and
we
are
moving
for
summary
judgment
on
it,
it's
incumbent
on
the
plaintiff
at
that
point
to
say,
no,
you
aren't
entitled
even
to
assert
the
affirmative
defense
because
we
have
this
action
and
this
action
and
this
action
which
were
taken,
which
are
tangible
employment
actions,
and
therefore
you
aren't
even
entitled
to
the
affirmative
defense.
and
that
didn't
happen.
at
no
point
in
this
case
has
the
respondent
ever
said
that
she
was
subjected
to
a
tangible
employment
action
other
than
the
constructive
discharge
itself.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
no,
justice
kennedy,
and
i...
i
guess
i--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--our...
our
position
really
is
that
this
case
and...
and
hostile
environment
cases
generally
which
are
alleged
to
be
constructive
discharges
are
just
like
ellerth,
that
what
you
do
is
you
look
at
what
the
supervisor
did
to
the
employee
to
provoke
the
discharge,
and
if
those
actions
were
hostile
work
environment,
if
they
were...
if
they
were...
i
hate
to
use
the
word
merely,
but
if
they
were
acts
of
sexual
harassment,
not
arising
to
tangible
actions,
if
the
employee
had
simply
sued
on
the
hostile
work
environment,
we'd
have
an
affirmative
defense.
our
position
is
that
doesn't
change
or
it
shouldn't
change
because
there
is
also
a
claim
that
it
was
so
bad
that
i
had
to
quit.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
if
that
were
true
across
the
board,
justice
kennedy,
there
would
be
no
difference.
you're...
you're
entirely
correct.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
i
think
that
is
certainly
a
way
to
go,
justice...
justice
souter.
if
it
were...
if
it
were
clear
across
the
board
in
all
jurisdictions
that
to
prove
a
constructive
discharge,
you
do
have
to
have
made
some
effort
to
invoke
a
remedial
process,
just
as
with
the
affirmative
defense,
then
that
would
certainly...
that
would
certainly
satisfy
our
concerns.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
yes,
because
then
you've
got
the...
the
lost
wages
and
so
forth
for...
for
the
entire
time.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
that
is...
that
is
the
way
we
think
that
it
should
be
couched,
justice
o'connor.
the...
the
use
of
the
constructive
discharge
is...
was
the
plaintiff's
choice,
of
course,
and--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--yes.
i
think
that
their...
their
view
is
that
a
constructive
discharge
is...
is
just
the
same
as
an
actual
discharge.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
yes.
that's...
that
is
correct.
and...
and
frankly,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
correct
analysis
either.
our
view
is
that
a...
a...
in
a...
in
a
sense
a
constructive
discharge
can't
ever
be
a
tangible
employment
action
because
it
isn't
an
action
at
all.
it's
just
a
construct.
our
view
is
you
look
at...
to
what
it
is
that
the
supervisor
did,
and
if
that's
a
tangible
employment
action,
then
there
is
no
affirmative
defense,
whether...
whether
or
not
the
employer
is--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--it
can
be.
an
employee
can
certainly
say
i
was...
i
was
subjected
to
a
humiliating
demotion
and
that
was
so
bad--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--that
i
quit.
had
she
just
sued
just
on
the
demotion,
clearly
a
tangible
employment
action,
and
we
would
have
no
affirmative
defense.
if
she
also
goes
on
to
say,
and
it
was
so
bad
that
i
quit,
i
think
we
again
should
not
have
the
affirmative
defense.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
yes,
they
do.
and
by
the
same
token,
if
the
employee
simply
says,
i
was
sexually
harassed
and
subjected
to
a
hostile
work
environment,
we
would
have
the
affirmative
defense.
if
she
goes
on
to
say,
and--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--i
don't
think
you'd
reach
that
question,
justice
stevens.
i...
i
think
what
would
come
into
play
there
is
the
idea
that
there
are...
there
are
some
people
in
every
organization
who
are
so
high
up
that
they
are
proxies
for
the
employer
itself.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
and
so
it...
it
really
is--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--that
would
be
actionable
because
it
is
the
action
of
the
employer,
and
you
don't
even
have
to
get
into
the
question
of
whether
it
is
an
agent
of
the
employer
or
not.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
i
think
at
that
point
it...
that
is
all
irrelevant
because
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
act
of
someone
who
is
the
proxy
of
the
employer
and
therefore
the
employer
is
responsible
for
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
if
it
were
really
true
that
to
prove
a
constructive
discharge
and
a
central
element
of
that
proof
would
be
that
the
employee
either
invoked
a
remedial
process
or
reasonably
failed
to
do
so,
if
that
were
required
as
an
element
of
constructive
discharge,
that
would
go
a
very
long
way
toward
meeting
our
concerns
in
this
case.
that
is
not,
however,
the
current
state
of
the
law,
at
least
not
in
all
jurisdictions.
that
is
really
the
only
point
i
wanted
to
reemphasize
on
rebuttal--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--justice
scalia,
that
i
wouldn't
say
is
acceptable
to
us,
but
that
problem--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--that
problem--
mr.
john
george
knorr,
iii
--it
is
a
problem
that
inheres
in
the
ellerth-faragher
affirmative
defense
from
the
beginning,
and
we
have
taken
that
defense
as
we
found
it.
i...
i
agree
that
it
is
not
entirely
satisfactory
to
us,
but
that
is
where
we
are.
