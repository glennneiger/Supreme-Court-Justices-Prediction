justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
justice
o'connor
is
going
a
little
bit
further
than
that.
i
think
she
is
suggesting
that
there
cannot
be
a
constructive
discharge
without
some
tangible
employment
action
because
constructive
discharge
itself
attributes
to
the
employer
the
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
employee,
and
that
desire
cannot
simply
be
communicated
through
some
lower...
lower
people.
now,
maybe
the...
the
tangible
employment
action
is
the
refusal
of
the
employer
to
respond
when
the
obscene
actions
of...
of
the...
of
the
coworkers
here
are
brought
to
the
employer's
attention.
that
would
be
i...
would
that
qualify
as
tangible
action
in...
in
your
part...
in
your
estimation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
point
is,
how
can
you
have
a
constructive
discharge?
the
only
person
that
can
discharge
is
the
employer.
you
have
to
pin
it
on
the
employer.
i
don't
know
how...
how
subordinates
alone
can...
can
produce
a
situation
that
amounts
to
a
constructive
discharge.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
you
think
it
ought
to
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
right
answer
to
this,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
a...
why
does
a
plaintiff
bring
a
constructive
discharge
suit
instead
of
just
a
regular
sexual
harassment
suit?
is
it...
is
it
a
matter
of
getting
more
damages?
is
that
the
reason
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
couching
it
in
those...
in
those
terms?
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
gornstein,
could
tell
us
what
the
government
proposes
that
we
do
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
asked
us
to
remand
because
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
wit.
justice
antonin
scalia
how...
how
could
the...
how
could
the
arrest
by
an
official
company
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
patently
is
not
so.
i
mean,
it...
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
employment.
you
don't...
you
don't
arrest
somebody
because
he's
your
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it...
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
this
action
you're
concerned
about
is
not
an
employer
type
of
action.
it
is...
it
is
quite
apart
from
employment.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
is
that?
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is
that
up
to
the
point
where
the
harassment
reaches
such
a
level
that
a
reasonable
person
would
leave,
up
to
that
point,
the
individual
could
not
sue
the
employer
because
the
employer
is
not
responsible
for
it.
but
suddenly
when
it
goes
over
the
edge
and
it's
even
worse
and
the
person
says,
i'm
going
to
leave,
suddenly
the
employer
is
automatically
responsible
for
it.
why...
why...
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
can
sue,
but
you're
going
to
lose
unless
you
show
that
there
was
some
official
action
on
the
part
of
the
employer
that...
that
caused
this
or...
or
that
the
employer
didn't
have
a...
a
means
of
remedying
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
don't
understand.
i
mean,
that's
my
point.
why
is
it
that
up
to
the
point...
you
know,
there's
terrible
harassment,
and
the
employer
could...
and
the
employee
could
sue.
but
if
the
employee
sued
the
employer,
she
would
lose.
but
when
it
goes
just...
just
an
inch
further
and
is
justifiable
cause
for
her
to
quit,
all
of
a
sudden
the
employer
becomes
responsible
for
what
he
was
not
responsible
for
earlier.
that...
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
the
responsibility
of
the
employee
i'm
concerned
about.
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
employer.
and
i
don't
agree
with
your
description
of...
of
what
the
rule
is.
that
is,
if
there
were
no
grievance
procedures
available...
and
that
i
agree
ought
to...
ought
to
pin...
pin
the
tail
on
the
employer.
it's
his
fault
and
i'd
hold
him
for
the
constructive
discharge.
but
you
say
if
they
were
not
available
or
if
she
reasonably
didn't
use
them,
well,
i
mean,
these...
these
renegade
employees
who
were...
who
were
performing
these
acts
of
sexual
harassment...
suppose
they
tell
her
if
you
file
a
grievance,
we're
going
to
kill
you.
now,
i'd
say
that's
pretty
reasonable
for
her
not
to
file
a
grievance.
but
is
that
the
employer's
fault?
how...
how
does
that
somehow
attribute
all
of
this
action
to
the
employer?
she
should
sue
these
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
he...
he
has
in
place
the
grievance
procedures.
the
fact
that
they
threatened
her
life
is...
is
not
at
all
his
responsibility.
so
how
do
you...
how
do
you
attribute
to
him
a
constructive
discharge?
i
don't
see
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
but
so...
so
long
as
you're
willing
to
acknowledge
that
the
mere
fact
that
she
was
reasonable
in
not
resorting
to
the
grievance
procedures,
does
not
establish
that
it's
the
employer's
fault.
so
long
as
you
accede
to
that,
you
say
that's
all
up
for...
for
proof
in...
in
the...
fine.
then...
then
i'll
agree
with
you.
but
you're
not
willing
to
concede
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then...
so
then
it's
not
true
that
it's
all
available
to
be
discussed
in
the...
i
mean,
what
are
you
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
either
relevant
or
it's
not
relevant.
now,
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
relevant
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
not
an
ounce
of
evidence
of
any...
any...
activity
by
the
employer.
not
an
ounce
of
any...
he
has
in
place
a
wonderful
grievance
procedure
and
the
only
problem
is
they
threatened
her
life.
and
that's
why
she
didn't
use
it.
now,
what
is...
what
is
there
for
the
jury
to...
to
consider?
justice
scalia
threatening
her
life
is
an
official
act
by...
by
his
employees.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
cannot
imagine
an
act
that's
more
ultra
vires.
i
cannot
imagine
an
act
more
unofficial
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
not
conclusive.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
conclusive.
justice
antonin
scalia
just...
just
one
of
a
whole
mishmosh
of
things
that
we
sort
of
chuck
at
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
would
find
it
acceptable
that
she
didn't
do
it
because
they
threatened
to
kill
her
and...
right?
that's
certainly
reasonable
basis
not
for
filing
a
complaint,
and
that...
that
would
attribute
the
whole
thing
to
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
live
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
very
logical,
though,
is
it?
