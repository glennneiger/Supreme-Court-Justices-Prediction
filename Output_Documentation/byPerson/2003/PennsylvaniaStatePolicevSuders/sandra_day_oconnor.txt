mr.
knorr,
i'm...
i
had
a
hard
time,
in
reading
the
briefs
on
this
case,
figuring
out
what
we
ought
to
do
with
the
suggestion
that
there's
a
constructive
discharge
theory.
now,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
weighed
in
on
that.
it
comes
out
of
the
labor
law
context
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
wondering,
you
know,
in...
in
ellerth
and
faragher,
what
we
said
was
that
when
no
tangible
employment
action
is
taken,
a
defending
employer
may
raise
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
liability.
so
i'm
wondering
if
we
shouldn't
just
try
to
look
at
the
facts
in
this
case
and
ask
whether
what
the
supervisors
did
amounted
to
a
tangible
employment
action
and
that
would
answer
the...
the
question.
i...
i
don't
know
that
viewing
it
through
the
lens
of
a
constructive
discharge
is
helpful.
what
she
says
is
that
the
supervisors...
that
she
had
taken
tests
to
qualify
for
a
promotion,
that
the
supervisors
had
hidden
the
results
of
those
tests
and
had
thereby
prevented
any
promotion,
and
that
there
was
a
false
arrest
i
guess.
now,
why
shouldn't
we
just
look
to
see
if
those
actions
occurred,
and
if
so,
whether
they
amounted
to
a
tangible
employment
action?
wouldn't
that
answer
the
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
troubled
by
that
too.
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
why
we're
using
that
term
at
all
in
light
of
the
case
background
here.
why
isn't
it
couched
in
terms
of
allegations
of
sexual
harassment
and
tangible
employment
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i...
i
thought
two
circuits
hold
that
a
constructive
discharge
is
never
a
tangible
employment
action.
i
mean,
that's
part
of
the
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
think
we
should
analyze
this
particular
case
in
light
of
the
third
circuit's
treatment?
how
does
this
fit
into
your
formula?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you're
very
unclear
on
what
the
employee
has
to
prove
to
establish
constructive
discharge.
it's
very
vague
to
me
what
it
is
you
say
the
employee
has
to
prove
with
regard
to
the
availability
or
lack
thereof
of
employer
remedies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
to
remedies
available
by
the
employer,
it
is
unclear
to
me
what
position
you
take
on
what
the
employee
has
to
prove.
that
the
employer
had
no
remedial
scheme
in
place
or
what
is
it?
