justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
why...
why...
suppose
that
you
have
a...
a
bank
that
guarantees
a
debt,
and
the
debt
is
smith's
debt.
and
the
guarantee
is
to
pay,
including
tax
debts.
that's
what
it
says.
it
was
a
condition
of
the
borrowing
or
some
other
thing.
now,
why
wouldn't
state
law
govern
the
period
of
time
in
respect
to
which
any
creditor,
including
the
government,
has
to
assert
a...
a
claim
under
that
note,
let's
say,
or
under
that
particular
written
guarantee
since
the
liability
there
is
a
creation
of
state
law
and
the
state
would
have
the
right
to
define
its
contours?
and
after
all,
that
guarantor
is
not
the
taxpayer.
the...
the
guarantor's
liability
arises
solely
out
of
the
fact
that
he
happens
to
have
entered
into
a
note
with
a
guarantor
who
promised
to
pay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
say
a
private--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes,
and
then
i'm
going
to
say
why
isn't
this
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
i...
if
i
enter
into
a
promise
with
you
and
say
in
return
for
my
lending,
you
know,
whatever
it
is,
i...
i
promise
that
i
will
pay
your
tax
debts,
but
by
the
way,
i
don't
want
to
pay
any
tax
debt
that
isn't
definite
before
january
the
5th,
2004
or
2010.
i
don't
want
to
pay
anything
that
arises--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
so
it's
a
substantive
procedural
distinction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
would
be
an
odd
state
law,
wouldn't
it?
imagine
that
i
guarantee
a
debt
or
suppose
a
partner
is
like
a
guarantor.
and
suppose
that
the
primary...
person
primary...
primarily
liable
is
in
litigation
with
the
debtor...
the
creditor,
rather.
and
because
of
delays
and
so
forth,
it
takes
about
15
years
to
resolve
this
litigation.
i've
never
heard
of
a
guarantor
who
wouldn't
become
liable
at
the
time
the
thing
is
final
and
that
the...
he
just
becomes...
i
mean,
how
does
it
work?
i
would
have
thought
a
guarantor
is
liable
for
the
debt
the
debtor
owes.
how
does
the
statute
work,
the
state
statute?
justice
breyer
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
exhaustion
of
remedies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm...
and
i'm
talking
about
states...
the
state
insofar
as
it
sees
the
partner
as
a
guarantor
of
the
liability
that
is
created
by
a
different
entity,
namely
the
partnership.
and
i'm
asking
if
under
state
law
of
california,
wouldn't
it
be
the
case
that
if
he's
a
guarantor
and
you
get
the
statute
of
limitations
on
a
matter
to
determine
liability
extended,
that
the
guarantee
also
extends.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
state
law
that
says
you
have
to
sue
the
guarantor
before
the
liability
that
he's
guaranteeing
is
determined.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
correct,
what
are
we
arguing
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
you're
back
to
your
question
of
whether
under
partnership
law
in
fact
this
is
a
guarantor
or
the
equivalent
or
a
surety.
i
understand
that
argument,
but
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
that
argument
is
resolved
against
you,
this
statute
of
limitations
argument
is
a
serious
red
herring
because
it
won't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
if
the
primary
argument,
which
you
want
to
argue,
that
they're
taxpayers
or
that
they
are
primarily
liable,
you
win
it
or
you
lose
it.
if
you
win
it,
you
win.
if
you
lose
it,
your
statute
of
limitations
argument
adds
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
my...
that's
what
i'm
thinking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
last
part.
they
are
for...
they
are
not
taxpayers
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute
who
are
liable
for
something
that
is
a
tax.
and
i
don't
know
why
that
wouldn't
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
state
law
makes
them,
in
effect,
guarantors
of
debts.
this
is
a
tax
debt.
so
they're
guarantors
of
the
tax
debt.
so,
therefore,
they're
liable
for
the
tax
or
sureties
or
some
other
equivalent
word.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
problem?
suppose...
i'm...
i'm
failing
to
see
it
but
maybe...
suppose
it's
true
that
what
the
uniform
partnership
act
says
is
true.
partners
are,
quote,
in
the
nature
of
guarantors,
end
quote,
rather
than
principal
debtors
on
the
debts
of
the
partnership.
so
let's
suppose
they're
like
guarantors.
i
would
have
thought
that
state
law
was
something
along
the
lines
of
a
guarantor
must
be
sued
in
order
to
collect
a...
a
guaranteed
debt
within
a
period
of
time
after
it
becomes
determined
that
such
a
debt
exists.
now,
i
would
think
that
that's
how
the
normal
state
law
runs.
so
unless
there's
something
federal
to
the
contrary...
and
by
the
way,
if
there
is,
they
have
10
more
years.
but
unless
there
is
something
federal
to
the
contrary,
there's
no
problem
with
bringing
this
case.
so
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
are
they
in
the
nature
of
guarantors.
and
i'd
be
interested...
well,
a,
i'm
interested
in
your
comment
on
what
i
just
said,
and
i'm
also
interested
in
the
comment
of
why
they're
not
guarantors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
that's
what
i'm
really
wondering
about.
i
mean...
but...
but
i
mean,
a,
they
may
have
not
have
raised
it
below.
b,
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
the
question.
c,
it
may
not
make
any
difference
because
the
state
and
federal
may
give
you
enough
time
anyway.
but
if
you
do
have
to
get
to
it,
i'm...
i'm
a
little
worried
about
it
because
i
don't...
i
don't
really
see
why
it
should
be
federal.
