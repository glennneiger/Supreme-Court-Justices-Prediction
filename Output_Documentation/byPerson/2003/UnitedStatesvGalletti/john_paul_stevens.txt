justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
for
this
question?
you
know,
there
are
some
state
statutes
of
limitations
that...
or
some
states
have
limitations
provisions
that
are
either
affirmative
defenses
or
some
are,
in
effect,
conditions
precedent
to
bringing
an
action.
if
california
had
the
latter
form
of
action,
how
would
you
decide
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
raise
the
statute
of
limitations
point
in
your
pleadings
in
the
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
stevens
and
the
filing
of
a
claim
in
a
bankruptcy
court
is
insufficient
because?
justice
stevens
so
this
is
simply
a
statute
of
limitations
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
an
assessment
affect
your
credit
rating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so...
so
you
want...
all
right.
