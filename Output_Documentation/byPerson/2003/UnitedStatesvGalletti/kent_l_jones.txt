mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
federal
employment
taxes
owed
by
a
partnership
were
assessed
by
the
commissioner,
and
when
the
partnership
failed
to
pay
the
taxes,
the
united
states
brought
this
action
to
recover
the
taxes
against
the
individual
partners
who
were
derivatively
liable
under
state
law
for
all
debts
of
the
partnership,
including
its
tax
debts.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you've
addressed
an...
an
unanswered
question
that
isn't
presented
here,
of
course.
it's
unanswered
because
federal
law--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and...
and
i
agree
with
that,
and...
and
the
uniform
partnership
act,
which
california
has
adopted,
contains
a
provision
that
specifies
that
the
creditor
must
exhaust
his
efforts
to
recover
from
the
partnership
before
he
can
recover
from
the
partners.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and...
and
so
that's
what
makes
it
clear
this
indeed
a
derivative
secondary
liability.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
not
so
much
i
don't
want
to
concede.
i
don't
feel
that
i'm
able
to
concede
that
not
because
it
is
related
to
this
case,
but
because
of
a...
a
structural
intellectual
problem
about
the
extent
to
which
whose
law
governs
in
that
situation.
if
it's
a
limitations
provision,
we
know
federal
law
governs
when
the
united
states
is
bringing
a
claim
that
it
acquires
in
its
sovereign
capacity.
whether
this
would
be
regarded
as
a
procedural
restriction
that
the
state
substantive
law
didn't...
now,
whether
you
want
to
think
this
is
substantive
or
procedural
may
affect
the
answer
to
the
question...
the
hypothetical
that
you've
raised.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
there--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there...
there
is
an...
the
uniform...
in
the
case
law,
there's
a
discussion
of
situations
where
the
partnership
is
known
to
be
insolvent.
you're
not
required
to
do
a
senseless
act.
you're
not
required
to
pursue
and
exhaust
against
the
partnership
when
it's
known
to
be
insolvent.
so
in
that
situation,
you
have
exhausted
because
the
partnership
is
insolvent.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
you've
brought
me
through...
to
a
lot
of
levels
of
complexity,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
is
we...
we
don't
dispute
that
you
need
to
give
a...
a
notice
of
assessment
in
order
to
collect
administratively
through
liens
and
levies.
that's
not
relevant
to
this
case
because
this
is
a
judicial
collection
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but,
nonetheless,
there
is
case
law
that
says
that
when
you
give
notice
to
the
partnership
of
its
liability,
that's
sufficient
as
constructive
notice
to
the
partners
to
permit
administrative
collection
through
liens
and
levies.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm...
i'm
familiar
with
the...
the
concept
of
interest
doesn't
run
until
notice
of
the
assessment
is
made,
but
nonetheless
again,
notice
to
the
partnership
would
be
constructive
to
the
partners.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i...
i
don't
mean
to
be...
i
don't
mean
to
sound
like
i'm
retreating
from
that
issue.
i'm
just...
it's
not
presented
here,
and
so
i'm
not
really
capable
standing
here--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's...
i
don't...
it
is
possible,
and
if
the
court
were
to
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings,
it's
possible
that
that
issue
would
be
raised.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't...
i
don't
know
what
your
practice
would
be.
i
would
think
your
practice
would
be
to
decide
the
issue
that's
presented.
you
could
note
other
issues
haven't
been
raised,
but
since
those
issues
haven't
been
briefed
here,
we're
not
really
in
a
position
to
advise
you
on
their
proper
resolution.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
okay.
well,
the
point
i
was
making
was
that
the
court
ruled
against
us
because
they
said
that
the
partnership
taxes
had
not
been
assessed
directly
against
the
partners.
but
respondents
now
correctly
concede
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
federal
law
that
a
derivative
or
secondary
state
law
liability
to
pay
a
tax
has
to
be
assessed
before
it
can
be
collected,
and
that
concession
is
plainly
correct
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
1933
in
the
leighton
case
where
the
court
held
that
a
derivative
or
secondary
liability
that
arises
under
state
law
to
pay
a
tax
may
be
recovered...
and
i
quote...
without
assessment
of
that
liability.
and
there
are
numerous
cases
that
have
applied
that
principle
in...
in
related
secondary
and
derivative
liability
contexts.
and
as...
as
i've
already
indicated,
those
principles
plainly
apply
here
because
under
the
uniform
partnership
act,
which
applies
in
california,
the
liability
of
the
partner
is
derivative
for
the...
and
secondary
rather
than
principal,
as
i've
discussed
with
justice
scalia.
not
only
is
it
clear
from
the
legal
structure
of
the
upa,
but
the
official
comments
to
the...
of...
to
that
act
state
that
the
liability
of
the
partnership
for
partnership
debts
is
principal
and
that
the
liability
of
partners
is...
is
in
the
nature
of
a
guarantor.
it's
secondary.
it
arises
only
when
the
partnership
doesn't
pay
its
own
debts.
federal
law
also
makes
clear
that
this
is
a
liability
that
attaches
directly
to
the
partnership.
this
is
a
federal
employment
tax.
it
applies
to
employers
because,
under
california
law,
the...
the
partnership
is
a
separate
and
distinct
legal
entity.
it
is
the
employer.
it
pays
the
wages.
its
payment
of
wages
is
what
causes
the
taxes
to
be
imposed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
the
way
the
cases
describe
it.
from
my...
and
that's
the
way
this
court
described
it
in...
in
commissioner
v.
stern.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
pardon
me?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
want
more.
i'm
just
being
finicky
i
guess,
because
to
me
we...
the
court
in
commissioner
v.
stern
said
that
these...
historically
these
are
substantive
liabilities
that
congress
accepts
from
state
law.
and
therefore,
the
court
applies
the
substantive
body
of
state
rules
in...
in
implementing
that
liability.
you
could
also
think
of
this...
and
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
commissioner
v.
stern.
but
you
can...
even
in
light
of
commissioner
v.
stern,
you
can
think
of
this
as
federal
law
borrowing
state
law
for
this
remedial
purpose,
and
congress
has
sanctioned
that
by
not
altering
the
principles
that
have
long
existed
on
this.
the...
but
the...
the
point
that
this
court
made
in
leighton
is
that
these
principles
that
they
apply
come
from
state
law
and
you
don't
a...
actually
respondents
now
admit
there's
no
mechanism
in
federal
law
to
assist
this...
assess
this
sort
of
secondary
derivative
state
law
liability,
and
that's
correct.
that's
what
the
court
addressed
in
the
leighton
case.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
just
misapplied
those
well-accepted
principles.
once
the
assessment
of
the
partnership
taxes
was
made,
under
section
6502
the
united
states
has
10
years
from
the
date
of
the
assessment
to
bring
any
proceeding
in
court
to
collect
the
taxes.
and
in
the
updike
case
in
1930,
the
court
held
that
that
10
years
applies
not
only
to
actions
against
the
directly
liable
party
but
also
to
a
person
whose
liability
is
derivative
or
secondary
and
arises
from
state
law.
and
the
court
explained
that
the
broad
purpose
and
broad
text
of
6502
applies
equally
in
both
cases
because
in
the
court's
words,
in
a
real
sense
the
action
against
the
derivatively
liable
party
is
a
proceeding
in
court
to
collect
the
tax.
as
the
court
said
in
updike,
the
aim
in
the
one
case,
as
in
the
other,
is
the
same.
it's
to
collect
the
tax
liability.
now,
in
this
court
respondents
do
not
dispute
that
accepted
understanding
of
6502.
instead,
they
raise
here
a
new
and,
indeed,
a
radical
claim
that
no
court
has
adopted
and
that
they
did
not
raise
prior
to
their
merits
brief
in
this
court.
what
they
argue
now
for
the
first
time
is
that
the
federal
statute
of
limitations
should
not
govern
this
derivative
liability
claim
because
since
it
stems
from
substantive
state
law,
the
state
statute
of
limitations
should
govern
it.
now,
since
they
didn't
raise
that
claim
at
any
time
before
their
merits
brief
in
this
court...
and
it
is
a
statute
of
limitations
which
is
an
affirmative
defense...
they're...
they've
waived
the
claim
as
too
rate
to...
too
late
to
raise
it.
but
nonetheless,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
their
claim
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions.
for
example,
in
the
summerlin
case,
this
court
held
that
whenever
the
united
states
acquires
a
claim
acting
in
its
governmental
capacity,
that
claim
of
the
united
states
is
not
subject
to
a
state
statute
of
limitations
because
of
the
sovereign
rights...
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states.
and
they
applied
that
holding
in
summerlin
to
a
situation
where
what
the
united
states
obtained
was
a
right
to
enforce
a
private
note
and
private
mortgage
that
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
that
in...
in
commissioner
v.
bresson
where
the
ninth
circuit
addressed
that
very
point,
they...
they
were...
they
wrote
a
very
useful
opinion
that
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
correct,
that
the...
that
if
it
is
the
passage
of
time
after
the
united
states
acquires
its
right
that
causes
the
claim
to
expire,
that
that
is
what
is
barred
by
the
summerlin
rationale
because
the
sovereign
rights
of
the
united
states
can't
be
extinguished.
and
so
whether
you
think
of
it
as
extinguishing
the
claim
or
limiting
the...
the
period
of
recovery,
in
either
event
what's
instrumental
is
that
the...
the
united
states
had
the
right
at
the
time
it
obtained
the
claim
and
that
the
state
law
could
not
thereafter
cut
that
right
off.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
so
you're
talking
about
a...
a
private
contractual
right--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
the
united
states
somehow
obtained
rights
under
by--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--levying,
for
example--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--on
the...
on
the
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's...
that's
a...
that's
exactly
frankly
what
happened
in
summerlin--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--except
summerlin
involved
a
housing
program
instead
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
in
summerlin,
the
government
obtained
a
private
note
and
enforced
it,
regardless
of
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
and
the
court's
reasoning
was
that
the...
that
the
united
states
as
sovereign
cannot
be
subject
to
limitations
imposed
on
the
rights
that
it
obtains.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
a
limit...
if
you're
talking
about
a
substantive
limitation
in
the
document
itself,
well,
the
united
states
takes
its...
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
assignor
in
that
situation,
and
we
don't
get
a
better
substantive
right...
substantive
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
certainly
that's
the
way
the
court
has
looked
at
it,
and
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no.
well,
that's
the
second
route
that
the
court
has
used
to
say
the
state's
limitations
don't
control,
and
that
is,
when
there's
a
federal
limitations
period
that
applies
to
the
claim,
then
the
state
provision
doesn't
control.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
under...
under
updike,
what
this
court
concluded
in
updike
was
that
there
is
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
that
applies
to
these
proceedings
in
court
to
collect
the
taxes,
which
includes
the
derivative
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
doesn't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
doesn't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--exactly.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
the...
if
the
court
were
to
find
it
appropriate
in
a
particular
instance
to
adopt
a
state
rule,
that
would
not
interfere
with
summerlin,
but
that
would...
that
would...
i
can't
think
of
a
case
exactly
like
that.
there
may
well
be
some.
but
most
federal
claims--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--most--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--most
federal
claims
come
within
some
general
statute
of
limitations,
and
this
is
certainly
a
situation
like
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
the
updike
case
makes
this
discussion
somewhat
hypothetical,
and
i
understood
justice
scalia's
question
to
be
in
that
vein.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i...
i
don't
need
to
worry
about
them,
and
i...
but
i'm
only
addressing
them
because
respondents
have
raised
them
at
this
point
in
the
case,
and
so
i'm
just
discussing
the
two
theories
that
this
court
has
applied
in
rejecting
that
kind
of
contention.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
now
clearly
their
primary
position,
and
for
the
reasons
i've
already
described
that
position
can't
be
reconciled
with
the
uniform
partnership
act
or
with...
or
with
the
federal
law
that
applies
to
these
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
there
is
a
statute
that
authorizes
an
assessment
of
that
liability
against
a
responsible
officer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it...
it
authorizes
the
assessment.
that's...
you
know,
it's
interesting.
there
are
certain
types--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
you
have
a
claim
based
on
state
law
or
common
law,
and
that's
the
reason
we
have
a
responsible
officer
statute
is
that
this
is
a
federal
claim.
there
isn't...
unlike
in
the
partnership
situation
and
in
the
ordinary
transferee
situation,
there's
not
a
backup
state
law
action.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
sometimes
it
is
troublesome,
but
it's
not
required
in
any
situation
under
our
understanding
of
the
existing
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
partnership
then.
yes.
i...
the
responsible
officers...
officer
liability
is
created
by
federal
statute,
unlike
the
partners'
obligation
for
the
debts
of
the
partnership.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
understand.
but
the
responsible
officer
liability
is...
is
really
a
radically
different
concept.
it
only...
it
only
arises
when
that
officer
had
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
taxes
weren't
being
paid
as
they
accrued
and
willfully
failed
to
pay
them
and...
and
was
responsible,
had
the
responsibility
to
pay
them.
it
is
a...
it
is
a
malfeasance
claim,
whereas
the
derivative
liability
claim
is
just
under
state
law,
you
are
liable
as
is
the
partnership,
and
we
can
enforce
that
state
law.
there's
another
example--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--where
the
similar
thing
happened.
3505,
which
is
the
lender's
liability.
there
was
no
lender's
liability
for
employment
taxes
that
the
court
discussed
in
the
jersey
shore
case.
that
liability
didn't
have
a...
a
common
law
precedent,
and
so
congress
created
the
liability
because
they
saw
a
specific
problem
where
lenders
were
allowing
or
in...
in
effect,
helping
employers
evade
employment
taxes
by
loaning
them
money
from
which
they
paid
wages
but
didn't
pay
taxes.
and
so
congress
created
this
separate
statutory
scheme.
but
respondents
are
correct
in
their
concession
that
there
is
no
mechanism
under
federal
law
for
assessing
the
derivative
state
law
liability
of
a
partner
for
the
debts
of
the
partnership.
and
so
as
the
court
held
in...
in
leighton,
we
can
proceed
without
assessment
against
them
to
enforce
that
liability.
now,
i
do
want
to
also
mention
the...
the
citations
that
respondents
make
to
section
6303.
that
section
appears
in
the
portion
of
the
code
that
addresses
administrative
collection
through
liens
and
levies,
and
it
states
that
the
secretary
is
to
give
notice
of
the
assessment
to
any
person
liable
for
the
tax.
the
cases
that
have
interpreted
and
applied
that
statute,
which
stem
from
1954,
have...
have
concluded
correctly
that
that
statute
applies
only
to
administrative
collection
through
liens
and
levies
and
has
no
application
to
judicial
collection
actions.
and
there's
a...
a
sound
historical
explanation
for
that,
and
that
is
that
prior
to
1954,
there
were
two
independent
routes
for
collecting
taxes.
the
secretary
was
authorized
by
the
code
to
bring
a
judicial
collection
suit,
but
there
was
a
separate
officer
known
as
the
collector
of
revenue
for
each
district.
and
the
collector
of
revenue
was,
by
the
code,
authorized
to
do
the
administrative
collection
through
liens
and
levies.
and
the
predecessor
of
6303
had
said
that
the
collector
is
to
give
notice
of
the
assessment
and
make
demands
for
payment.
and
it
was
well
established
that
that
applied
to
his
actions
in
administrative
collection
and
had
no
application
of
the
secretary's
independent
authority
to
bring
a
judicial
collection
suit.
in
1954
in
revising
the
code,
congress
eliminated
references
to
the
collector
in
the
code,
placed
the
secretary
in
charge
both
of
the...
of
judicial
and
administrative
enforcement
and
changed
the
predecessor
language
of
6303
from
saying
the
collector
is
to
give
notice
to
saying
the
secretary
is
to
give
notice.
but
in
doing
so,
congress
did
not
mean
to
change...
and
the
courts
that
have
reviewed
this
have
correctly
concluded
did
not
change...
the
fact
that
this
notice
of
assessment
requirement
applies
only
to
the
administrative
collection
area,
has
no
application
to
judicial
collection
suits
like
this
one.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
think
the
record
discusses
whether
there
was
notice
to
the
partnership.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
let
me...
i
can't
say
what
we
did
or
didn't
do
in
notice
because
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
in
this
case
because
administrative
collection
isn't
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
okay,
let's
assume
that.
if
we
gave
notice
and
demand
to
the
partnership,
what
we
would
be
authorized
to
do
is
clearly
under
6321
and...
make
a
lien
and
levy
against
any
assets
of
the
partnership.
and
then
as
i
said,
although...
the...
the
cases
are
also
perfectly
consistent
that
the
notice
to
the
partnership
is
valid
as
constructive
notice
to
the
partners.
and
so,
for
example,
if
we
have
a
partnership
employment
tax
liability
from
smith
construction
and
the
two
partners
are
bob
jones
and
bill
wilson,
notice
of
the
assessment
to
the
partnership
is
valid
as
notice
to
its
two
partners.
and
so
our
lien
arises,
if
they
don't
pay
the
tax,
but
if
a
third
party
creditor
is
out
there,
first
national
bank,
the
first...
our
notice
to
the
partnership
may
not
be
notice
to
the
first
national
bank.
and
so
in
a
lien
contest
we
might
not
have
the
prior
lien
vis-a-vis
this
other
party,
but
vis-a-vis
the
two
partners,
the
cases
say
that
our
notice
is
valid
for
6303
purposes
to
them
because,
well,
of
course,
a
partnership
only
acts
through
its
partners
and
notice
to
one
of
them
or
to
the
partnership
is
valid,
constructive
notice
to
all
the
others.
there
is
no
case
inconsistent
with
that
conclusion,
but
again,
it's
plainly
not
presented
in
this
case
and
we
would
not
ask
the
court
to
address
it.
there's
no
need
for
it
to.
this
is
just
a
judicial
collection
case.
the
only
issue
that
is
really
before
the
court
is
whether
we
have
to
give
notice...
i'm
sorry...
whether
we
have
to
assess
the
individual
partners
to
collect
the
state
law
derivative
liability.
and
for
the
reasons
i've
described,
that
the
decision
below
is
incorrect
on
that
and...
and
should
be
reversed.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
at
page
3
of
respondents'
brief
on
the
merits,
they
say...
and
i
quote...
if
respondents
are
secondarily
liable
for
the
partnership
taxes,
then
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
that
the
irs
must
assess
respondents
to
collect
the
partnership
taxes
is
incorrect.
it
is
clear
to
us
that
there
is...
this
is
a
secondary
derivative
liability
that
partners
have
under
state
law.
i
didn't
hear
respondents
give
any
explanation
of
why
that
isn't
so.
given
those
two
facts,
then
this
court's
holding
in
leighton
seems
clearly
applicable,
which
is
that
we
don't
have
to
assess
a
derivative
state
law
liability
to
bring
suit
to
recover
upon
that
liability.
now,
respondents
say,
well,
somehow
that
holding
is
influenced
by
the
fact
that
transferee
liability
is
provided
in
6901
of
the
code.
it's
interesting
that
in...
in
the
leighton
case
what
the
court
held
was
that
the
6901
transferee
liability
is
a
supplementary
remedy
that
did
not
displace
and,
indeed,
left
in
place
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
bring
its
suit
upon
the
derivative
state
law
liability
without
assessment.
so
the...
the
principle
that
we
draw
from
the
leighton
case
is
not
dependent
on
any
of
the
specific
statutes
that
address
specific
types
of...
of
assignments
of
transferees.
in
fact,
it's
utterly
independent
of
that,
which
was
the
very
issue
the
court
decided
in
leighton.
given
that
and...
and
given
that
there's
a
derivative
sub-secondary
liability,
we
can
recover
against
state
law.
then
the
only
other
question
is,
well,
what
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
that,
which
the
court
held
in
updike
that
it's
6502
which
applies
both
to
the
direct
liability
and
the
derivative
liability.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
reason
it
should
be
federal
is
because
all
of
these
actions
are
designed,
as
the
court
stressed
in
updike,
to
collect
the
tax.
we
have
different
remedies.
congress
could
federalize
all
of
this.
congress
could
write
a
statute
that
said,
you
know,
you
can
bring
suits
for
derivative
liabilities
and
that
those
suits
will...
specifically
subject
to
6502.
and
what
the
court
noted
in
stern
was
that
congress
hasn't
done
that
because
the
court
has
consistently
applied
state
law
to
permit
such
tax
collection
to
occur.
and...
and
so
that's
why
updike
has
got
to
be
right
because
this
is
a
strong
federal
interest
in
collecting
taxes,
not
to
be
too
big
about
it,
but
i
mean,
this
court
has
noted
that
the
collection
of
taxes
is
the
lifeblood
of
government.
this
is
as
sovereign
a
claim
as
we
have,
and...
and
because
of
that,
we
need
to
have
a
uniform
statute
of
limitations,
which
congress
has
provided
under
6502.
if...
if
we
were
left
to
the
haphazards
of
state
law,
we
would
certainly
want
congress
to...
to
address
that
and
correct
it,
but
they
don't
need
to
correct
it
because
since
1930
in
the
updike
case,
the
court
has
explained
that
6502
is
broad
enough
to
cover
both
types
of...
of
judicial
collection
proceedings.
in
the
court's
words,
the
action
against
derivatively
liable
party
is
in
every
real
sense
a
proceeding
in
court
to
collect
the
tax,
and
that's
the...
that's
the
statutory
language.
and...
and
i...
there
has
been
no
contention
that
that's
not
a
correct
interpretation
of
6502.
i
do
not
know
what
references
respondents
may
have
in
mind
to
arguments
they
raised
under
state
statutes
of
limitations
before.
we're
not
familiar
with
those.
the
statute
that's
referred
to
in
their
merits
brief
is
a
specific
state
statute.
we're
not
aware
that
that
statute
was
ever
cited
before
by
the
parties
in
this
case,
but
even
if
it
was,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
reasoning
of
the
summerlin
case
and...
and
of
updike,
which
is...
there's
already
a
federal
statute...
should
control
that
question
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
it's
a
question
for
congress
what's...
you
know,
what
makes
everybody
better
off.
and
what
congress
has
said
is
that
we
can
assess
these
taxes
against
the
employer.
the
employer
under
state
law
is
a
separate
and
distinct
legal
entity
known
as
the
partnership.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we...
well,
we
have
authority
to
give
them
notice
of
an
assessment
and
collect
from
them
administratively,
but
in
terms
of,
if
you
will,
making
an
assessment
them
directly,
we're
supposed
to
assess
the
party
whose
subject
to
the
tax.
