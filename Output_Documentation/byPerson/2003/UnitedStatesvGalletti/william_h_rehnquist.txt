chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
02-1389,
the
united
states
v.
abel
cosmo
galletti.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
don't
you
go
ahead
with
the
issues
that
are
presented?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you...
you
agree
that
it's
the
law
of
california
that
imposes
the
derivative
liability
on
the
partners?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
more
do
you
want?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
say
what
more
do
you
want.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
it's
doubly
hypothetical
because
they
can't
raise
the
whole
issue--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--at
this
point
anyway.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
haberbush.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
the
government
says
you...
you
did
not
raise
what
is
now
your
principal
argument
until
your
merits
brief.
do
you
agree
with
that
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
touch
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
don't
ordinarily
decide
questions
of
state
law
here.
i
think
we
would
generally
feel
perhaps
the
ninth
circuit
knows
more
about
california
law
than
we
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said,
we
would
think.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
haberbush,
do
you
defend
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
in
order
to
collect
against
the
partners,
an
assessment
would
have
to
be
made
against
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought...
i
thought
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
you
couldn't
collect
against
the
partners
unless
you
assess
them
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
haberbush.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1389,
united
states
against
galletti
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
