justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it's
not
presented,
depending
on
what
you
mean
by
derivative
liability.
i...
i
always
thought
that
derivative
liability
would
be
liability
that
doesn't
attach
unless
and
until
the
person
primarily
liable
fails
to...
fails
to
pay
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
maybe
the
united
states
may
not
be
bound
by
that.
you...
you
don't
want
to...
you
don't
want
to
concede
that
the
united
states
is
bound
by
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
know,
in...
in
other
cases,
let's
say
when
the...
when
the
federal
government
creates
a
federal
right
without
establishing
a
statute
of
limitations
for
that
federal
right,
state
law
does
not
govern,
but
federal
law
looks
to
the...
to
the
state
statute
of
limitations
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
be
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
a...
a
federal
claim.
you
mean
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
whatever
on
federal
claims?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
that's
fine.
but
i'm
talking
about
the
more
general
proposition
that...
that
you're...
that
you're
defending
or...
or
proposing
that...
that
state
law
does
not...
never...
never
applies
to
a...
to
a
federal
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
a
claim
by
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
does.
now,
it
may
not
apply
of
its
own
force.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
applies
because
of
adoption
by
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
imagine
our
not
doing
it.
i
can't
imagine
our
saying
that,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
clock
keeps
ticking
on
federal
claims
forever
and
ever.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
it
seems
to
me
it's...
it's...
the
burden
is
on
you
to
make
the
claim
that
a
state
statute
applies,
and
you
never
claimed
that
any
state
statute
applies.
now,
the
government
here,
out
of
an
excess
of
caution
or
maybe
to
explain
the
whole
situation
to
us,
puts
in
that
footnote,
but
that
doesn't
create
a
claim
on
your
part
that
the
state
statute
governs.
did
you
ever
assert
that...
that
this
matter
was
governed
by...
by
a
state
statute
of
limitations
until
your
merits
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
asserted
that
it
was
governed
by
a
state
statute
of
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we're
talking
about
did
you
ever
say
this
claim
is
barred
by...
it...
it
is
too
late
under
this
state
statute
of
limitations,
citing
the
state
statute
of
limitations?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
provide
us
with--
justice
scalia
--where
can
we
find
that
in
the
record?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
will
we
find
that?
justice
scalia
well,
isn't
the
place
to
raise
it
in
the
bankruptcy
court?
i
mean,
that's
where
your
pleadings...
that's
where
your
responsive
pleadings
were
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have...
have
any
cases
for
that,
that
a
tax
claim
loses
its
character
as
a
tax
claim
when
relief
is
sought
not
against
the
person
primarily
liable
but
against
somebody
derivatively
liable?
it
seems
to
me
it's
still
a
tax
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
expect
you
to
find
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
you
shouldn't
be
a
general
partner
if...
if
you're
not
prepared
to
know
what's
going
on.
it's
pretty
risky.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
responsibility
you
assume
when
he...
it
only
applies
to
general
partners.
it
doesn't
apply
to
limited
partners.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
don't
become
a
general
partner
if
you're
not
willing
to
know
what's
going
on
in
the
partnership.
i...
i
thought
that's
the
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
it
means
to
be
a
general
partner.
you're...
you're
going
to
be
liable
for
what
the
partnership
does.
so
you
better
pay
attention.
i...
and
you're
saying
this
is
unjust
somehow?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
was
responding
to
these
letters
from
the
government?
the
secretary?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
does
she
take
it
in
to...
to
her
boss
who
was
presumably
one
of
the
general
partners
and
say,
hey,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
government
says
we
owe
a
lot
of
money.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
place
that
kind
of
a
burden
on
the
partners
that
you're
talking
about.
they're
entirely
free
not
to
read
the
mail.
justice
scalia
but...
but
the
problem
is
they're
going
to
be
liable
for
whatever
debts
are
incurred
by
the
partnership
if
they
don't
do
it.
that's
the
only
burden
imposed.
