did
you
raise
it
as
an
affirmative
defense
under
state
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
one
ground
of
your
objection
was
under
state
law
it's
barred?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
say
that
they're
taxpayers
because
they're
partners,
and
therefore
they...
and...
and
that's
why
the...
their...
their
right
to
an
assessment
can
be
claimed.
but
by
the
same
reasoning
that
you
follow,
if
they
are
taxpayers
because
they
are
partners,
why
isn't
notice
to
the
partnership
notice
to
the
partners
or
assessment
against
the
partnership
assessment
against
the
partners?
why...
why
do
you,
in
effect,
make
a
metaphysical
distinction
in
the
latter
case
but
not
in
the
former?
justice
david
h.
souter
it...
it
would
also
cause
an
enormous
number
of
assessments
to
be
made
that
ultimately
would
have
no...
no
use.
i
mean,
the...
the
amount
of
administrative
assessing
going
on
would...
would
be
staggering.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it's
not
a
very
significant
burden
to
a
partner
to
say
you
better
make
sure
they're
paying
the
taxes.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
better
be
careful
who
you
form
a
partnership--
