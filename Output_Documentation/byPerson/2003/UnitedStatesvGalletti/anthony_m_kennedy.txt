did
the
government
have
to
wait
until
the
partnership
failed
to
pay?
could
it
have
proceeded
immediately
against
the
partners
under...
under
the
governing
state
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
you
tell
me
as
a
matter
of
practice
if...
if
you
know?
suppose
there's
a
partnership
which
is
a
little
murky.
it's
in
the
cayman
islands
and
they're
behind,
but
that
one
of
the...
the
general
partners
is
in
california.
can
you
just
proceed
against
him,
do
you
know?
does
the
revenue
service--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--ever
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
in
that
situation...
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
but
you
can't
just
levy
on
the
account
if
the
tax
has
not
been
assessed
against
that
partner
individually,
but
you
can
commence
some
other
sorts
of
proceedings
which
would
allow
a
subsequent
levy.
or
am
i
wrong,
or
is
that
clear?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you...
can
you
tell
me
in
the
case
of
a
corporation,
if
the
responsible
officer
does
not
withhold
employment
taxes,
i...
i
take
it...
i
thought
i
remembered
that...
that
the
responsible
officer
is
personally
liable.
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ah,
but
you
have
to
assess
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can...
can
you
proceed
against
the
responsible
officer
without
the
assessment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
if
in
the
case
of
corporate
officers,
there
must
be
an
assessment,
then
by
analogy
it
would
seem
that
it
wouldn't
be
too
much
trouble
for
the
irs
to
assess
the
partners
in
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
thought
that
it
was
required
in
the...
in...
in
the
corporate
case.
you
said
it
has
to
be
assessed
against
the
responsible
officer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
simply
wondering
if...
if
that
isn't
a
model,
if
that's
what
happens
in
the
corporate
instance,
in
this
case
where
the
statute
is...
is
silent
on
the
point,
whether
we
shouldn't
just
assume
that
since
it's
not
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
government
in
the
corporate
context
to
require
it
to
assess
the
responsible
officer
before
the
tax
can
be
collected,
that
we
shouldn't
say
the
same
thing
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there's
a--
justice
kennedy
as
a
federal--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
california
practice,
i
assume
statute
of
limitations
is
an
affirmative
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
most
partners
know
what's
happening
in
their
business?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
i...
i
would
think,
by
and
large,
most
partners
know
what's
going
on.
i
mean,
certainly
there
are
exceptional
cases,
but
certainly
that's
not
typical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
when
you
accumulate
tax
liabilities
of
several
hundred
thousand
dollars,
they
ought
to
find
that...
be
able
to
find
that
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
all
the
more
reason
they
should
have
known
about
it
a
lot
earlier.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
you
shouldn't
rely
on
the
united
states
government
to
tell
you
what
you...
how
your
financial
affairs
are
coming
along
and
be
the
primary
source
of
information.
