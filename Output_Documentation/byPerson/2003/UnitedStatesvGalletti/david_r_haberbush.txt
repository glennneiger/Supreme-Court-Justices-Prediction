mr.
david
r.
haberbush
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we've
heard
some
interesting
arguments,
and
i'd
like
to
address
the
history
here
of
the
way
in
which
this
alleged
derivative
liability
is
imposed
upon
the
partners.
we
contend
that
the
partners--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--your
honor,
no,
i
don't.
this
case
has
always
been
about
statutes
of
limitation.
we
were
addressing,
in
fact,
a
argument
raised
in
the
merits
brief
by
the
government.
if
the
court
will
note,
at
page
5...
i'm
sorry...
page
12,
footnote
5,
this
specific
question
is
addressed
by
the
government
stating
that
it's
a
federal
not
a
state
statute
of
limitation
that
comes
into
play.
and
our
portion
of
the
brief
is
simply
a
reply
to
that.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
yes,
we
did
in
the
courts
below
and
our
briefs
below.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
your
honor,
what
we
argued
was
that
if
the
federal
statutes
did
not
apply,
section
6303
requiring
notice
and
demand,
if
these
partners
are
not
taxpayers
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
then
state
law
would
govern.
and
yes,
we
did
raise
it
below.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
need
to
touch
upon
it,
because
the
court
of
appeals
felt
and
decided
that
these
partners
are
taxpayers
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
and
that's
the
precise
question
i
would
like
to
address.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
in
the
united...
this
originated
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
so
the
district
court--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--your
honor,
we
did.
we
raised
it
both
in
terms
of
the
statute
of
limitations
under
section
6303
and
under
state
law.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well,
we
objected
to
the
proof
of
claim
which
is
akin
to
an
answer,
and
yes--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--our
objection
was
a
fairly
generic
objection
in
all
honesty--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--yes,
we
did.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
i
believe
you'll
find
that
at
the...
the
district
court
level
after
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
if
indeed
it
is
an
affirmative
defense,
yes.
our
objection
to
the
claim
was
this
was
not
an
enforceable
claim
under
law,
state
or
federal,
and
our
reason
for
it
was
barred
by
the
limitations
periods.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
yes,
your...
your
honor,
it
is.
we,
however,
believe
that
this
case
does
not
be
controlled
by
state
law,
but
rather
by
federal
law.
a
partner's
liability
for
the
debts
of
a
partnership
may
arise
under
state
law,
and
this
court
has
noted
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
kraft
that
state
law
defines
the
rights
as
between
the
parties,
but
the
manner
by
which
it
may
be
collected,
the
tax
itself
or
the
claim,
is
governed
by
federal
law.
and
that
is
really
the
heart
of
what
our
argument
is.
there
is
no
specific
internal
revenue
code
provision
that
makes
a
partner
liable
for
a
partnership
debt.
what
the
government
in
this
case
does
is
it
relies
specifically
upon
historical
cases
that
stem
from
old
section
280,
which
is
adopted
as
section
6901
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
whereby
assessments
may
be
made
against
transferees,
donees,
and
fiduciaries,
and
the
cases
interpreting
those
statutes
basically
find
that
there
is
a
derivative
liability
with
a
coterminous
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
your
honor,
we
believe
the
state
statute
is...
is
one
that
does
not
require
exhaustion
of
remedies
as
against
the
partnership.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
that
would--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
what
we're
arguing
about
here
is
that
this
is
not
a
suretyship
or
a
secondary
liability--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--well,
unless
federal
law
controls.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
unless
these
parties
are
taxpayers
under
federal
law,
in
which
case--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--i
think
not.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
i
think
not.
i
think
we
win,
and
let
me
explain
why.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
limitations
periods.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
state
law
governing
guarantees.
it
has
to
do
with
the
way
this
court
is
asked
to
define
this
particular
claim
in
this
particular
case.
is
it
a
tax
claim
or
is
it
a
claim
which
is
derived
from
the
partnership
liability?
in
other
words,
is
it
a
tax
debt
or
is
it
a
debt
because
they're
liable
for
a
debt
of
the
partnership
so
that
it
loses
its
nature
as
a
tax
claim?
if
that's
the
case,
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case.
tax
claims
in
bankruptcy
have
priority
over
other
claims
under
section
507(a)
of
title
11
of
the
united
states
code.
those
claims
too
are
not
dischargeable
if
they're
a
tax
claim
under
section
523
of
title
11.
so
if
the
court
determines
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
guarantee
pursuant
to
state
law
and
not
a
tax
claim,
then
this
debt
will
be
discharged
in
this
bankruptcy
case.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
have
authority
for
that.
however,
if
it
is
a
tax--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--however,
if
they
are
liable
for
the
tax,
this
court
has
already
stated
on
a
number
of
occasions,
including
the
most
recent
case
of
u.s.
v.
kraft,
someone
who
is
subject
to
the
tax
is
someone
who
pays
it,
someone
who
is
liable
for
it.
these
parties
are
liable
for
the
tax.
they
are
subject
to
the
tax
under
section
7701(a)(14)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
therefore
they
are
taxpayers.
once
they
are
taxpayers,
that
invokes
the
provisions
of
section
6501
requiring
assessment
or
suit
within
3
years.
we
don't
claim
that
assessment
is
the
only
method.
we
claim
assessment
or
suit,
which
is
consistent
with
the
history
of
the
cases,
and
that's
a
3-year
limitation
period
as
to
these--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
we
do.
i
think
that
the
argument
that
there
is
constructive
notice
merely
because
one
is
a
partner
creates
notice
to...
notice
to
the
partnership
is
notice
to
the
partners.
there
is
no
controlling
case
on
this
idea,
and
that
would
be
too
a
question
i
think
of
state
law,
whether
notice
to
a
partnership
is
notice
to
the
partners.
and
we've
clearly
cited
to
california
law
that
says
you
must
commence
a
separate
suit
against
the
partner
in
order
to
obtain
a
judgment
against
it.
there
is
no
california
law
that
says
that
by
filing
a
suit
against
the
partner,
that's
sufficient
for
due
process
purposes
of
creating
notice
to
the
partners
such
that--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--well,
certainly
that's
true.
and
that's--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--well,
thank
you.
and...
and
yes,
this
court
ordinarily
does
not
address
questions
of
state
law.
we
think
that
this
is
a
federal
statutory
interpretation.
either
these
persons
are
taxpayers
liable
for
a
tax
or
they
are
not
taxpayers
liable
some...
for
something
that
is
not
a
tax.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well,
your
honor--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--all
of
the
cases
referred
to
for
the
coterminous
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
what
would
be
suggested
would
be
applied
here
if
in
fact
they
are
liable
for
this
tax
debt
and
therefore
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
apply,
are
all
cases
where
specific
enabling
provisions
created
the
liability
of
those
persons.
under
section
6324,
certain
persons
are
made
personally
liable.
under
section
6901,
certain
persons
may
be
assessed
with
taxes
as
transferees.
and
those
specific
statutes
have
provisions
in
them
that
say
that
the
assessment
and
collection
and
enforcement
of
the
tax...
this
is
6901
and
its
predecessor,
section
280,
where
the
collection
assessment
and
enforcement
of
the
tax
is
subject
to
the
same
provisions
and
the
same
limitations
as
the
tax
itself.
so
it's
not
surprising
that
you
have
cases
like
leighton
and
updike
where
the
statute
of
limitations
set
forth
in
what
is
now
6502
applies
to
them
because
they're
subject
to
the
same
limitation
periods.
there
is
nothing
in
the
internal
revenue
code
that
sets
forth
a
limitation
period
as
to
partners.
if
one
adopts
the
guarantor
analogy,
then
this
is
conceivable
a
case
where
any
number
of
years
could
pass
where
the
partners
would
become
liable.
your...
i
would
point
out
the
court's
record
in
the
joint
appendix.
at
pages
100
and
102,
we
have
the
proofs
of
claim
that
were
filed
in
these
bankruptcy
cases,
and
these
proofs
of
claim
on
their
face
show
that
the
government
in
this
case
is
not
simply
filing
a
claim
as
though
it
were
a
lawsuit
against
these
partners.
these
proofs
of
claim
were
filed
as
secured
claims
in
both
of
the
two
cases
that
are
before
the
court.
secured
by
what?
motor
vehicles
and
real
estate.
so
the
internal
revenue
service
is
taking
the
position
clearly,
unequivocally
that
it
can
enforce
this
debt
by
the
summary
collection
process
which
has
been
called
awesome
and...
and
super
powers
that
are
not
available
otherwise.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--that's
not...
that
may
not
be
before
the
court,
but
the
government
has
taken
the
position
the
only
way,
the
sole
and
single
way,
it
can
collect
taxes
is
to
file
suits
against
partners.
we
would
suggest
that
if
the
court
were
to
permit
assessment,
rule
that
they
are
taxpayers
subject
to
assessment,
subject
to
suit,
that
that
would
enhance
collection.
it
would
encourage
partners
at
the
earliest
opportunity
to
cause
their
partnerships
to
pay
taxes.
it
would
cause
partners
at
the
earliest
opportunity
to
pay
the
taxes.
in
this
instance,
you
have
proofs
of
claim--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--well,
the
amount
of
suits
could
be
staggering
as
well
to
collect
these
kinds
of
taxes.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
very
well.
here
the
internal
revenue
service
has
filed
proofs
of
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
court
not
for
the
debt
of
the
tax
but
for
the
tax,
for
the
penalties,
and
for
the
interest.
guarantors
under
california
law
are
liable
for
the
debt
and
perhaps
the
interest,
but
not
for
the
penalties.
the
court
will
note
that
these
proofs
of
claim
are
approximately
three
to
four
times
as
much
as
the
amount
of
tax
that
was
originally
assessed
against
the
partnership
in
the
initial
instance.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
these
partners
had
knowledge
or
notice
of
these
taxes
at
any
time
before
these
proofs
of
claim
were
filed.
now,
under
california
law,
if
you
have
a
guarantor,
the
guarantor
knows
of
the
liability
that
that
guarantor
is
offering
surety
for.
that
guarantor
knows
that
that
liability
exists.
that
guarantor
can
encourage
the
principal
party
to
pay
the
tax
or
the
debt
in
question.
here
the
policies
that
are
urged
by
the
government
do
not
encourage
collection
of
this--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--yes,
we
do.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
no,
not
within
that
specific
limitation.
we
think
that
an
assessment
or
a
suit
should
be
brought
within
the
statutory
period--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--to
that
extent,
the
opinion
is
wrong
for
the
reason
that
it
is
a
well-held
proposition
that
suit
or
assessment
may
be
brought
under
section
6501
within
the
3-year
period,
so
that
it's
not
exclusively
assessment
that's
involved.
and
this
court
and
other
courts,
i
believe,
have...
have
ruled
that
assessment
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
collection.
however,
some
action
must
be
taken
within
the
statutory
limitations
periods.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
it's
untimely.
it
is
not
done
within
the
period
of
time--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--that's
our
position.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
simply
a
statute
of
limitations
case.
the
government
has
contended
that
this
is
a
tax
governed
by
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
liability
may
be
created
by
state
law,
and
this
court
has
consistently
said
while
liability
may
be...
be
created
by
state
law,
the
enforceability
of
that
liability
is
a
subject
of
federal
law.
the
federal
laws
provide
for
6303
notice
and
demand.
they
provide
for...
6501
provides
that
assessment
must
be
made.
the...
the
government
suggests
that
there
can--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--yes,
i
can.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
yes,
i
can.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well,
the
assessment
is
the
notation
or
recording
of
the
liability.
however,
section
6203
says
that
to
be
a
proper
assessment,
it
must
record
the
liability
of
the
taxpayer
and
we,
of
course,
say
that
the
taxpayer
also
includes
the
partners.
and
yes,
there
could
be
a
single
assessment
naming
numerous
parties.
there
are
examples
of
that.
for
example,
a
husband
and
wife
are
jointly
assessed.
an
assessment
against
a
husband
or
a
wife
independently
is
not
an
assessment
against
the
other.
so
there
are
multiple
assessments
that
are
capable
of
being
made
under
the
code.
there
are
numerous
other
instances
where
assessments
are
made.
6901,
for
example,
assessment--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--your
honor,
that
might
make
a
difference.
we...
we
would
contend
that
it
does
not
make
a
difference.
we
have
cited
to
cases...
and
i
don't
recall
them
right
off
the
top
of
my...
my
head
at
this
moment...
where
the
assessment...
in
fact,
that
was
cool
fuel,
inc.
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
where
the
assessment
actually
has
to
be
received
and
made.
it
has
to
name
who
the
taxpayer
is.
marvel
v.
the
united
states.
while
the
taxpayer
there
was
named
as
a
partnership's
name,
the
individuals'
social
security
numbers,
taxpayer
identification
numbers,
were
on
that...
that
assessment,
and
that
was
found
to
be
good
as
to
those
persons
even
though
they
were
not
individually
named.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
below
where
there
is...
that
issue
has
been
addressed.
there
is
no
facts
that
were
derived
at
the
trial
of
this
matter
where
that
was
addressed.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--yes.
it
is
not
before
the
court,
however,
whether
they
did
or
didn't,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
suggesting
that
they
did
get
such
notice.
that's
why
the...
the
government
relies
so
heavily
on
its
constructive
notice
theory,
although
starkly
absent
from
that
argument
is
any
california
law
to
support
that
idea
that
notice
to
a
partnership
is
constructive
notice
to
its
partners.
turning
back
to
the...
the
idea
of
the...
the
assessment
in
this
case,
the...
there
are
striking
examples
throughout
the
brief
of
the
government,
although
the
government
contends
that
it
is
not
able
legally
to
assess
partners,
there
are
no
less
than
12
cases
cited
in
the
briefs,
10
of
which
were
cited
by
the
government,
in
which
summary
collection
process
was
instituted
against
partners,
and
in...
in
any
of
those
cases
there
was
an
assessment.
in
fact,
the
one
case
that's
cited
by
the
government,
the...
the
united
states
v.
wright...
that's
the
case
which
came
out
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
government
contends
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
ninth
circuit
case
in
this
instance
is
one
where
the
united
states
district
court
in
its
findings
found
that
the
partners
were
assessed.
and
it's
not
surprising
therefore,
that
the
wright
court
found
that
there
were--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--that
is
correct.
however,
the
district
court
did
find
that
there
were
assessments.
the
seventh
circuit
found
that
that
was
irrelevant
to
the...
the
determination.
however,
it
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
idea
that
in
that
case
there
were
coterminous
statute
of
limitations.
for
the
reason
that
assessments
were
made
within
the
statutory
period
of
time...
that
was
still
within
the
coterminous
periods...
then
the
collection.
the
question
was
whether
the
6502
allowed
the
collection
against
the
partners
who
were
jointly
liable
with
the
partnership
in
that
instance.
the
statutory
period
of
time
allowed
to
the
partnership,
because
it
had
been
tolled
during
a
bankruptcy,
the
court
found
coterminous
statute
of
limitations,
relying
on
the
updike
case
as
its
example.
we...
we
believe
that
the
collection
of
taxes
would
be
enhanced
by
adopting
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
requiring
the
filing
of
lawsuits
in
every
instance
where
partners
are
liable
for
the
debts
of
a
partnership
which
has
failed
to
pay
its
taxes
and
which
may
or
may
not
be
out
of
business,
is
simply
a
policy
which
would
have
litigation
that
is
not
required.
if
the
partnership
is
liable
for
the
tax
and
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
notice
provisions
of
6302
and
the
provisions
of
6501
allowing
suit
or
assessment
within
3
years
applies,
that
that
would
enhance
the
collection
of
taxes.
we
believe
that...
excuse
me...
we
believe
that
by
doing
that,
the
tax
will
be
paid
at
the
earliest
possible
time.
interest
and
penalties,
such
as
have
accrued
in
this
case,
would
not
accrue
because
the
partners
would
be
encouraged
at
every
point
and
at
every
spot
to
cause
their
partnership
to
pay
or
to
pay
the
tax
themselves.
the
government
is
not
in
the
business
of
banking
tax
claims,
if
you
will,
allowing
them
to
accrue
penalties
and
interest
and
thereafter,
for
who
knows
how
many
years,
potentially
as
many
as
3
plus
10,
and
if
suit
is
filed
within
the
10
years
under
6502,
the...
the
term
for
enforcing
a
judgment.
so
it
could
be
20-25
years
that
a
partner
could
be
out
there
liable
for
the
tax
during
which
penalties
and
interest
continue
to
accrue,
and
then
finally
one
day
maybe
that
partner
or
that
partner's
estate
or
the
partner's
beneficiaries
of
the
partner's
estate
might
become
liable
for
this
tax.
we
believe
that
by
filing
the
tax...
by
filing
an
assessment
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
against
the
partners,
this
would
encourage
tax
collection.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
if
the
partner
knows,
that
is
correct.
if
the--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--i
don't
know
that
it's
unreasonable
to
assume
that,
but
i
suppose
it
is
reasonable.
however,
there
are
partnerships
and
there
are
partnerships,
and
some
partnerships
have
managing
partners
who
are
actively
involved
in
the
business
of
the
partnership
and--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--unfortunately,
i'm
only
involved
in
my
law
partnership
and
i
know
what's
going
on
there.
i've
not
been
involved--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
that--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--well,
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
does
that
mean
that
every
partner
has
to
go
through
every
single
piece
of
mail
that
enters
the
partnership
and
be
familiar
with
every
single
thing
that
occurs?
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well,
your
honor,
these
are
over
a
number
of
quarters.
these
were
not
all
assessed
at
one
time.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well,
husbands
oftentimes
hide
things
from
their
wives
who
are
a
joint
taxpayer
as
well.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--your
honor--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--if
it's
a--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--if
it's
a
managing...
if
it's
a
managing
general
partner,
i
assume
that
that's
the
case.
if
in
fact
the
partnership
had
ceased
its
operations
and
these
notices
came
afterwards,
who
knows
who
received
the
notices.
i
don't
think
that
the
law
imposes
a
burden
upon
every
single
general
partner
to
look
at
every
single
bill
and
piece
of
paper
that
comes
into
a
partnership.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
that
may
be
so,
but
if
the...
if
the
government
were
required
to
do
so,
partners
would
at
every
point
in
time
be
encouraged
to
cause
the
partnership
to
meet
its
financial
obligations.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well,
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well,
your
honor,
and
looking
at
burdens
there
is
no...
there
is
no
insignificant...
excuse
me.
it's
not
a
significant
burden
to
place
upon
the
government
to
simply
send
another
notice
to
the
partners
regarding
their
derivative
liability
for
these
claims.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
well,
of
course.
however,
there...
there
have
been
dishonest
partners,
and
the
cases
that
i
cite--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--well,
yes,
and
there
are
cases
cited
in
the
briefs
that
say
exactly
that.
however,
if...
if
the
policy
is
to
collect
taxes
and
collect
them
promptly,
then
that
is
encouraged,
rather
than
filing
suit
against
partners,
by
a
simple
assessment
sent
in
the
mail
to
the
partners.
if
there
is
nothing
further--
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
--yes,
it
does.
it
does.
mr.
david
r.
haberbush
thank
you.
