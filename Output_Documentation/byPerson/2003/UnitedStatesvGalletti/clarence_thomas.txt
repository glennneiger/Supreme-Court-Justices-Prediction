justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondents
were
general
partners
of
the
marina
cabrillo
company
a
partnership.
from
1992
to
1995
the
partnership
incurred
substantial
federal
employment
tax
liabilities
arising
from
its
failure
to
withhold
the
requisite
amount
of
federal
income
taxes
from
its
employees.
the
irs
assessed
those
taxes
against
the
partnership
within
the
statutory
3-year
requirement
thereby
triggering
the
10-year
extension
to
the
statute
of
limitations
on
a
tax
collection
action.
however,
the
partnership
never
satisfied
the
debt.
several
years
later,
the
respondent
filed
for
bankruptcy.
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings,
the
irs
filed
proofs
of
claims
for
the
partnership’s
unpaid
employment
taxes.
since
under
california
law,
respondents
were
liable
generally
for
the
debts
of
the
partnership.
respondents
objected
to
the
claims
arguing
that
the
taxes
had
never
been
assessed
against
them
and
thus,
the
statute
of
limitations
for
collecting
the
tax
debt
had
expired.
both
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
district
court
agreed
and
sustained
the
respondent’s
objections
to
the
claims.
a
ninth
circuit
panel
affirmed.
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
that
the
irs
had
timely
assessed
the
taxes
against
the
partnership
which
triggered
a
10-year
extension
to
the
limitations
period
for
collecting
the
taxes.
the
ninth
circuit
held
however,
that
the
assessment
against
the
partnership
extended
the
statute
of
limitation
only
with
respect
to
the
partnership
because
the
partners
were
separate
tax
payers
under
the
internal
revenue
code
and
thus
must
me
separately
assessed.
since
the
3-year
statute
of
limitations
were
assessing
the
tax
debt
against
respondent
had
expired,
the
ninth
circuit
included
that
the
irs’
claim
against
the
partners
was
time
barred.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
respondents
argued
that
a
valid
assessment
triggering
the
10-year
extension
of
statute
of
limitation
must
name
them
individually
because
they
are
primarily
liable
for
the
tax
debt.
first,
respondents
argued
that
they
are
primarily
liable
because
26
u.s.c.
section
6203
requires
a
secretary
to
assess
taxes
by
recording
the
liability
of
the
tax
payer
and
they
are
each
separate
tax
payers
under
the
code.
the
statute’s
reference
to
the
tax
payer’s
liability
however,
indicates
that
we
must
look
to
the
underlying
liability
to
identify
the
relevant
tax
payer
against
whom
the
tax
must
be
assessed.
here,
the
tax
liability
arose
from
the
partnership’s
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirement
that
employers
deduct
and
withhold
certain
amounts
of
employment
taxes.
thus,
the
relevant
tax
payer
is
the
employer.
respondents
also
argued
that
they
are
primarily
liable
for
the
tax
debt
because
california
law
makes
them
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
all
of
the
partnership’s
debts.
this
fact
is
irrelevant,
however.
in
order
to
show
that
they
are
primarily
liable
for
the
debt,
respondents
must
demonstrate
that
the
employment
taxes
were
imposed
directly
upon
them
as
the
employer.
respondents
have
not
shown
that
they
are
primarily
liable
for
the
tax
debt
and
the
code
does
not
require
the
government
to
make
separate
assessments
of
a
single
tax
debt
against
secondarily
liable
parties
in
order
to
trigger
the
extended
limitations
period,
because
it
is
the
tax
rather
than
the
person
that
is
assessed.
the
assessment's
consequence
is
the
extension
of
the
limitation’s
period
for
the
collecting
of
the
debt
attached
to
the
collection
of
the
debt
without
reference
to
the
identities
of
the
secondarily
liable
parties.
in
this
case,
the
government’s
timely
assessment
of
the
partnership
was
sufficient
to
extend
the
limitation’s
period
for
the
collection
of
the
taxes
from
respondents.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
