mr.
kent,
if
you're
not
right
about
that
and
you
do
have
to
have
individual
notice
and
demand
to
the
partners,
then
there's
a
consequence
other
than
liens
and
levies,
isn't
there,
where
you
have
whopping
penalties
and
interest
attached?
i
thought
if
you
don't
give
notice
and
demand
within
the
60-day
period,
then
not
only
can't
you
impose
liens,
but
that
the
interest
and
penalties
stop
running.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
wrong
about
that
constructive
notice,
then
you
could
still
say,
well,
the
statute
has
been
extended
10
years
because
of
the
assessment.
however,
one
might
conclude
that
the
interest
stops
running
and
that
you
can't
use
administrative
collection
procedures.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
would
be
to
the
extent
on...
if...
if
this
thing
is
remanded
with
instructions
that
the
assessment
counts
against
all
of
them,
that
there
would
be
the
question
remaining
about
the
interest
and
penalties.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
we
should
maybe
flag
it
but
not
decide
it?
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
is
this
question
really
academic
in
this
case
because
you
have
not
one
but
two
federal
limitations,
one,
the
regular
3-year
period,
then
the
extension
by
10
years
following
an
assessment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here,
what
you're
relying
on
are
the
federal
limitations
period.
so
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
suppose
there
had
been
no
federal
limitations.
justice
ginsburg
i
thought
their
primary
position,
though,
was
that
the
partners
are
not
secondarily
liable,
they're
primarily
liable,
so
that
they
are
the
taxpayer
and
they're
entitled
to
assessment
notice
and
demand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
conceding
then
that
there
could
be
no
liens
and
levies
against
the
partners
here
because
there
was
no
notice
and
demand--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--individually
to
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no.
to
the
partners.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
just
explained
these
two
different
routes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
said
that
this
is
a
judicial
collection
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
other
doesn't
apply.
so
i'm
asking
you
if
you
are
now
making
the
concession
that
those
words...
what
are
they...
each
person
liable
for
unpaid
tax,
would
stop
you
from
using
the
administrative
collection
route
because
you
didn't
give
notice
and
demand
individually.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
assume
you
gave
notice
and
demand
only
to
the
partnership.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whether
they
could
or
not,
they're
saying
that
the
question
here
is
a
judicial
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
so
maybe
they're
wrong
and
maybe
they're
right
about
that,
but
that's
not
before
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
shouldn't
an
assessment
against
the
partnership
be
good
as
to
the
partners
as
well?
i
mean,
the
whole
difference
is
that
you'd
have
to
add
the...
the
names
of
the
individual
partners.
i
mean,
the
assessment
itself
is
something
in
a
file
in
some
building.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
does
it...
would
it
matter
if
in
fact
the
partners
knew...
had
received
the...
i
assume
that
the
notice
and
demand
would
come
to
the
partnership.
this
is
a
small
partnership.
there
were
what?
four
partners
involved?
if
they
had
actual
notice,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
certainly
they
had
actual
notice.
your
big
due
process
objection
that
you
make
would
not...
would...
would
be
very
thin,
would
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
addressed
it
in
your
brief.
you
said
if
they
didn't
get
individual
notice
and
demand,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
said
that...
but
i
thought
judge
easterbrook
said
that
that
was
irrelevant,
that
there
might
have
been
a
fact
question
about
that
whether
there
were
individual
assessments.
but
in
any
case,
the
court's
rationale
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing
would
stop
a
partner
from
paying
the
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
talking
about
a
partnership
that
has
not
paid...
what
was
it...
fica
and
futa
taxes.
surely,
the
partners
were
aware
that
they
were
not
paying
the
taxes
that
were
due
year
after
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
why
isn't
mr.
haberbush
right
at
least
when
he
says
everybody
would
be
better
off
if
you
went
ahead
and
listed
the
partners
as
well
on
the
assessment
and
gave
them
notice
and
demand?
then
there
would
never
be
any
hassle
of
whether
you
could
use
both
remedies,
administrative
and
judicial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
you're
impeded
that
you
have
no
authority
to
give
the
partners
notice
individually?
