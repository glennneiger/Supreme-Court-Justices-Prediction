mr.
dennis
balske
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
have
a
narrow
question
of
fair
presentation
here,
and
it
isn't
a
great
effort
for
the
courts,
i
don't
believe,
in
mr.
reese's
case,
to
go
searching
to
find
that
he
did
fairly
present.
we
start
out
by
going
to
the
pcr
petition
itself,
which
alleges
the
violation
both
under
the
state
and
federal
constitution.
it
mentions
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
and
then,
when
the--
mr.
dennis
balske
--yes,
i
am.
and
when--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
do,
i
do.
and
when
the
trial
court
decides
it,
we
go
right
into
the
oregon
clear
statement
rule.
oregon
post-conviction
is
designed
to
let
the
appellate
courts
know
the
basis
of
those
trial
court
rulings,
so
we
have
the
clear
statement
rule
under
138.640.
mr.
dennis
balske
correct.
mr.
dennis
balske
you're
right.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
well
the...
the
way
it
works
in
pcr
is
the
court,
under
the
pleadings,
decides
the
case
based
on
the
first
amended
petition.
that's
the
one
that
states
the
legal
basis
of
the
claim
under
the
federal
and
state
constitution.
that's
the
one
that
the
judgment
of
the
state
trial
court
made
and...
and
relied
on.
so
under
the
clear
statement
rule,
then,
when
it
made
its
decision
and
cited
a
federal
ground,
under
oregon's
clear
statement
rule,
we
have
a
decision
on
federal
grounds
at
that--
mr.
dennis
balske
--yes.
mr.
dennis
balske
that
is
a
rule
of
oregon
law,
and
that--
mr.
dennis
balske
--all
right.
it's
not
a
case,
it's
a
statute.
mr.
dennis
balske
it's
138.640.
it's
at
the
state's
brief
in
the
appendix
at
page
4,
and
it
reads
as
follows,
quote,
the
order
making
final
disposition
of
the
petition
shall
state
clearly
the
grounds
upon
which
the
cause
was
determined,
and
whether
a
state
or
federal
question,
or
both,
was
presented
and
decided.
and
in
mr.
reese's
case,
the
trial
court
followed
that
rule
and
filed
a
memorandum
of
opinion
that
cited
that
its
decision
of
the
ineffectiveness
claim
was
on
federal
grounds
only.
and
then
mr....
then
mr.
reese
appeals.
mr.
dennis
balske
no.
mr.
dennis
balske
no.
but
again,
that's
not
before
the
court
in
the
issue
presented,
and
that
issue
was
waived
by
the
state
in
the
ninth
circuit.
they
abandoned
any
position
that
mr.
reese's
claim
wasn't
sufficiently
factually
based,
and
we're
presented
with
the
question
of
fair
presentation,
whether
or
not
he
indicated--
mr.
dennis
balske
--right.
mr.
dennis
balske
right.
mr.
dennis
balske
right.
mr.
dennis
balske
there...
let...
let
me
help
you
there.
if
you
will
turn
to
the...
page
44
of
the
joint
appendix,
what
you're
going
to
find
there
is
the
petition
for
review
to
the
oregon
supreme
court.
and
when
you
get
to
page
44,
and
44
and
45
across,
what
you
see
is
it
follows
the
standard
form,
it's
in
proper
form,
nothing
more.
but
when
you
turn
the
page,
as
a
busy
judge
you're
scanning,
as
you're
talking
about,
and
you
look
and
you
say,
what's
it
about,
is
this
a
state
case
or
a
federal
case,
look
on
the
first
page,
46,
index
of
authorities,
constitutions.
only
one,
the
federal
constitution,
four
constitutional
amendments
cited,
fifth,
sixth,
eight,
fourteenth--
mr.
dennis
balske
--and...
well--
mr.
dennis
balske
--a
judge--
mr.
dennis
balske
--you're
not
going
to
look
for
an
argument
because
you're
an
oregon
supreme
court
judge,
and
under
the
oregon
supreme
court
rule,
i'm...
yeah,
9.05(4)(a)(v),
the
petitioner
only
presents
a
brief
argument
if
he
wants
to,
it's
optional.
you
don't
put
argument
into
a
petition
for
a
review,
so--
mr.
dennis
balske
--yes,
and
in--
mr.
dennis
balske
--that's
where
we
turn
to
the
next
page,
47,
statement
of
legal
questions
presented
on
review.
we...
we
see
on
the
page
across
from
the
federal
constitution,
ineffectiveness...
ineffective
assistance
of
both
trial
court
and
appellate
court
counsel.
the
next
paragraph,
statement
of
reasons
for
reversal
of
court
of
appeals.
again
we
see
ineffective
assistance
of
both
trial
court
and
appellate
court
counsel.
so,
it...
we're
scanning
it,
we're
busy,
we're
just
trying
to
decide
whether
we're
going
to
review
the
case.
we're
not
deciding
it
on
the
merits.
we've
got
a--
federal
case.
we've
got
a
federal
issue.
it's
presented
by
mr.
reese.
mr.
dennis
balske
and
that--
mr.
dennis
balske
--yeah,
what...
well,
whether
you're
going
to
brief
it,
whether
you're
going
to
present
legal
argument.
it's
optional
under--
mr.
dennis
balske
--because
the
state
waived
that
defense
in
this
case.
i'm...
i...
that's
just
the
way--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
dennis
balske
the
judge
might
say
that,
but
the
judge
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
a
federal
question,
a
federal
issue
presented
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
dennis
balske
well--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well,
i
don't...
well,
it's
conjecture
what
they
would
have
decided
or
thought.
what's
critical
here
is
what
was
presented,
the
question
today
is
what
was
presented
versus--
mr.
dennis
balske
--sure.
mr.
dennis
balske
well--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i...
i
can
answer
it
by
saying
that
the
prisoners
are
pretty
ignorant.
their
lawyers
in
the
state
post-conviction
system,
bless
their
souls,
are
not
the
sharpest
lawyers
in
the
world.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
tell
you
what,
let
me
give
you
the
perfect
example
in
this
case.
turn
to
page
42
of
the
state's
brief
for
its
application
of
the
rule.
here's
how
sharp
you
have
to
be.
now,
i
think
if
you
read
the
cover
of
the
brief,
we
see
that
five
lawyers,
including
the
attorney
general
of
oregon
have--
mr.
dennis
balske
--yes.
i'm
sorry.
please
look
at
the
top
and
then
look
at
number
iia
and
read
their
language,
alert
the
state
court
to
the
federal
legal
source
of
the
claim
by,
a,
citing
to
the
sixth
amendment,
quote,
my
appellate
attorney
violated
my
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment.
i'm
sorry,
you
didn't
pick
that
up.
it's
page
42--
mr.
dennis
balske
--if
mr.
reese
followed
the
formula
written
by
the
attorney
general,
he
would
fail
their
test,
because
the
right
to
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
comes
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
not
the
sixth
amendment.
but
the
state's
attorney
generals,
who
are
writing
the
test
for
you,
can't
even
get
it
right.
how
is
a
poor
indigent
prisoner
going
to
know
how
to
say
the
right
number?
i
mean--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i...
i
think,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
dennis
balske
--but--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
thought
when
we're
talking
about
appellate
counsel,
though,
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
cover
it,
because
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
give
you
the
right
to
effective
counsel
on
your
appeal,
only
at
trial.
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
and
due
process
are
what
actually
cover
them.
so,
if...
if
you're
claiming
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate,
not
trial,
appellate
counsel,
it
is
fourteenth
amendment,
it's
not
sixth
amendment.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
the...
it...
the
trouble
here,
the
heart--
mr.
dennis
balske
--no.
this
isn't
one
of
those,
because
that's
at
article
i,
section
11,
it
doesn't.
so
this
isn't
the
easy
case,
this
is
a--
mr.
dennis
balske
--tougher
case.
mr.
dennis
balske
i
think
they
said
that
and--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
think
they
said
that,
and
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
that
far
to
find
that
mr.
reese
fairly
presented
his
claim.
mr.
dennis
balske
i'm--
mr.
dennis
balske
--no.
mr.
dennis
balske
i
don't.
mr.
dennis
balske
i
do
not
defend
the
ninth
circuit's
test.
i
only
defend
the
judgment.
mr.
dennis
balske
i
only
say
to
you
he
fairly
presented
the
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
dennis
balske
yes.
mr.
dennis
balske
correct.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
if
the...
the...
there
are
differences
in
the
circuits,
so
i
can't
disagree--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well,
i--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
don't
think
they
are
in
the
sense
of,
although
i
know
this
court
likely
views
the
ninth
circuit
as
quote,
unquote,
a
liberal
circuit
of
sorts,
when
you
read
their
opinion
here,
they
were
being
very
conservative.
they're
saying
duncan
v.
henry
applies.
under
duncan
you
must
state
it
at
every
level
of
the
proceedings.
i
mean,
they--
mr.
dennis
balske
--yes,
it
is.
it
is.
mr.
dennis
balske
no,
i
was
talking
about--
mr.
dennis
balske
--they
were
applying
your
duncan
decision.
mr.
dennis
balske
right.
mr.
dennis
balske
well--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well...
sorry.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
what
the
purpose
of
the
exhaustion
rule
is
to
give
him
a
fair
opportunity
to
decide
it.
and
when
you're
talking
about
petitions
for
review,
it's
a
little
different
because
it's
not
your
brief
on
the
merits
where
they're
actually
deciding--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well--
mr.
dennis
balske
--here...
here
we're
talking
about
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
we're
talking
about
it
with
an
oregon
statute
that
required
the
oregon
court
to
even
tell
the
appellate
courts
whether
it
had
been
decided
under
the
state
or
the
federal
constitution.
and
here
they
said
this
was
decided
under
federal.
and
then
when
he
uses
ineffective,
i
know
that
that's
less
than
satisfying,
but
in
oregon
too,
if
you
look
in
the
state's
brief,
i
think,
at
page
4,
footnote
5,
what
you're
going
to
find
there
is
oregon's...
the
state
of
oregon's
position
on
what
a
inmate
means
when
he
says
ineffectiveness.
there
it
says
that
in
applying
article
i,
section
11
of
the
oregon
constitution,
quote,
oregon
courts
often
refer
to
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
instead
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
the
term
usually
employed
by
the
state
and
federal
courts
in
applying
the
analogous
provision
of
the
federal
constitution.
so
as
the
oregon
courts
are
reading
the
pleadings,
the
definition
we're
looking
at,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
the
term
usually
employed
by
the
state
and
federal
courts.
we're
giving,
factual
parts
aside,
which
aren't
with
this
case
at
this
point,
legal
only,
the
oregon
courts
were
fairly
presented
with
the
federal
question
because--
mr.
dennis
balske
--right.
well,
i...
all
i'm,
i
guess
i
inartfully
stated
it.
i...
the
position
i
wanted
to
convey,
and
i
didn't,
is
that
we
started
out
with
a
clear
federal
claim,
and
when
he
used
ineffective
twice
more
in
his
appeals,
he
did
nothing
at
all
to
dispel
anybody
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
federal
case.
it
started
out
federal
and
he
had
allegations
under
state
and
federal
constitution.
it
got
decided
federal
and
then
he
said
ineffectiveness.
he
gave
no
indication
that
he
was
narrowing
the
case
at
all.
and
a
good
contrast
is
another
ninth
circuit
en
banc
case,
peterson,
because
peterson
raised
it
just
like
mr.
reese
initially,
under
both
constitutions.
he
raised
it
again
that
way
in
the
appellate
court.
but
when
he
got
to
his
petition
for
review,
he
indicated
that,
to
the
oregon
supreme
court,
that
he
was
going
on
the
state
constitution,
because
he
only
said
in
his
petition
for
review
that
this
violated
article
i,
section
11
of
the
oregon
constitution.
that's
a
contrast,
and
much...
and
he,
as
the
ninth
circuit
held,
did
not
exhaust
his
state
remedies,
because
he
didn't
give
the
oregon
supreme
court
the
fair
opportunity,
because
what
he
did
was
he
took
their
eyes
and
led
them
over
to
the
state
constitution.
and
mr.
reese
didn't
do
that.
mr.
dennis
balske
sure.
my
reasoning
is
that
it's
fairly
presented
when
a
state
inmate
clearly
articulates
it
under
the
federal
constitution,
and
then
continues
to
appeal
that
judgment
without
indicating
in
any
way
whatsoever
that
he's
relying
on
anything
but
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
dennis
balske
that...
i...
that's
true.
i
agree
with
that
portion
of
it.
i
guess
maybe
i--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i--
mr.
dennis
balske
--that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
balske
i
did--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
did,
but
i--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
did,
but
i
didn't--
mr.
dennis
balske
--it's--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
understand.
mr.
dennis
balske
but,
yeah--
mr.
dennis
balske
--it's
argued
in--
mr.
dennis
balske
--it's
in
section
iii
of
my
brief.
mr.
dennis
balske
okay.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
i--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well,
i
guess
what
i
want
to
say
is
this.
i
think...
if
the
rule
that
i'm...
i'm
not
necessarily
espousing
a
rule,
i'm
trying
to
say
that
my
client,
mr.
reese,
fairly
presented.
but
in
saying
that
mr.
reese
fairly
presented,
i
don't
think
that
our
approach
is
going
to
place
a
great
burden
on
the
courts
by
any
stretch,
because
all
you
have
to
look
at
is
his
pleading
in
the
state
court
that
started
it,
where
he
says
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
then
you
just
look
at
his
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
his
petition
for
review,
and
the
answer
is
there.
and--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
guess
you're
seeing
my
focus
being
back
in
the
state
courts,
and
i'm
looking
at
federal
court.
i'm
looking
at
when
the
petitioner
files
his
petition
and
the
state
steps
forward
and
says
failure
to
exhaust.
petitioner's
counsel
then
has
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
saying,
take
a
look
at
what
was
in
the
briefs
and
what
was
presented,
not
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
state
courts
when
they
looked
at
them--
mr.
dennis
balske
--but
what
did
he
present?
mr.
dennis
balske
yes.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
what
we
have
here--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well...
well,
here's--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well,
and
i
think
with
the
rule,
here's...
here's
the
caveat
to
the
rule,
so
to
speak,
and
it's
that
comity
goes
both
ways.
in
other
words,
we're
respecting
the
state
courts
have
given
him
the
opportunity,
but
we're
also
going
to
respect
the
state's
courts
own
rules
and
statutes
that
they
use
when
they're
looking
at
petitions
and
appeals.
and
here
we're
looking
at
oregon.
when
you
look
at
oregon,
we
turn
the
page
to
oregon,
we
have
the
statute
that
i
read
early...
earlier,
the
plain
statement,
clear
statement
rule.
so--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well,
that
goes
to
the...
the...
specifying
the
basis
of
the
judgment
in
the
trial
court--
mr.
dennis
balske
--whether
it's
a
state
or
a
federal
issue.
mr.
dennis
balske
and
in
this
case,
in
his
written
opinion,
he
does
that.
mr.
dennis
balske
and
then
in
the
appeal
process,
i'm...
the...
the...
the
reason
you
have
the
clear
statement
rule
is
so
the
appellate
courts
will
know
what
the
trial
court
did,
not--
mr.
dennis
balske
--the...
the
court
of
appeals
most
certainly
would
have
seen
it
and
the...
the
oregon
supreme
court
was
on
notice
by
his
petition,
i
mean,
the
petition
for
review
itself--
mr.
dennis
balske
--is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
i
guess,
you
know,
i
didn't
think
that
i
needed
the
ninth
circuit's
and
i...
i
must
be
confused
now,
because
i
think
i
just--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well,
i
think
i
can--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
dennis
balske
yeah.
mr.
dennis
balske
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
yes,
in
this
sense
of...
did
you
want--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
guess
i
didn't
follow
your
question.
could
i
ask
you
to
repeat
it?
mr.
dennis
balske
right.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
at
the
trial
level,
trial
ineffectiveness,
they
are
different
clearly.
they
have
a
test
that's
called
inadequate
for
state
counsel.
they
call
it
ineffective
under
strickland--
mr.
dennis
balske
--it's
a
difference
in
substance
when
you're
talking
about
trial
court
ineffectiveness.
in...
in
our
case
when
we
move
over--
mr.
dennis
balske
--now
we're
talking
about
appellate
ineffectiveness.
mr.
dennis
balske
they've
got
one
test
that
was
discussed
during
earlier
questions,
and
what
they
do
is
they
interchangeably
use
the
words
ineffective
and
inadequate.
they
don't
use
any
one
term
all
the
time,
but
there's
just
one
test.
that's
oregon
law.
mr.
dennis
balske
yes.
mr.
dennis
balske
sure.
mr.
dennis
balske
right.
mr.
dennis
balske
well,
i
think
it
will
be
in...
i
did
it
in
three
parts,
and
the
third
part
would
have
been
that--
mr.
dennis
balske
--oh,
oh,
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
even
thinking.
mr.
dennis
balske
i'm
sorry.
mr.
dennis
balske
right.
i...
i,
you
know,
i
honestly
don't
remember
what
i
argued
at
all
in
that
brief.
i
haven't
looked
at
that
in
preparing
for
this
and
i
apologize,
but
i--
mr.
dennis
balske
--i
mean,
i
know
that--
mr.
dennis
balske
--well,
at...
i
don't
disagree
that
o'sullivan
says
that
it's
got
to
be
presented
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
and
my
position
is
simply
that
he
did
so
in
this
case.
mr.
dennis
balske
that
would
have
been
a
bigger
problem
for
me
than
this
problem,
yes,
because
although
he
said,
and
part
of
his
saying
was
under
the
oregon
balfour
procedure
when
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer,
he
said,
my
lawyer
and
i
disagreed
on
what
issues
to
raise.
one
thing
that
mr.
reese
didn't
say
factually
was
what
those
issues
were,
and
that
would
be
my
problem
if
their
position
were
that
factually
it
wasn't
clear
enough.
mr.
dennis
balske
yes,
i...
that's
true.
they
did
abandon
it.
mr.
dennis
balske
i
think
you
should,
and
i've
argued
in
my
brief
that
you
should
because
they
dropped
it
from
the
case
and
abandoned
it,
and
because
the
only
issue
presented
is
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
fairly
presented
it.
so
i
would
espouse
that,
whether
you
have
to
or
not,
obviously
your
decision.
mr.
dennis
balske
well
sure.
the
first
piece--
mr.
dennis
balske
--and...
and
i
think
that
is
fair
presentation
law.
you
have
to
supply
sufficient
facts
and
the
law
upon
which
you
rely.
here
they
didn't
object
to
the
insufficiency
of
facts,
but
the
rule
wouldn't
be
any
different
than
it
was
before
under
picard.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
