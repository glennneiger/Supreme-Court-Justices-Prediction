mr.
hardy
myers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
state
prisoner
decides
to
attack
his
conviction
on
the
basis
of
a
claimed
violation
of
federal
constitutional
right,
your
cases
have
held
that
he
must
first
alert
the
state
courts
he
is
raising
a
federal
claim,
if
that
claim
is
to
be
exhausted
for
federal
habeas
purposes.
but
what
the
prisoner
must
say
to
the
state
courts
to
tell
them
he
is
raising
a
federal
claim
continues
to
be
a...
a
troubled
area
of
federal
habeas
law.
it
is
one
that
has
divided
the
circuits
and
is
producing
very
different
analyses
and
results.
some
cases
are
holding
that
the
prisoner
must
make
some
explicit
citation
or
reference
to
the
federal
source
of
his
claim.
some
cases
are
holding
that
a
federal
claim
has
been
fairly
presented
even
when...
even
though
what
the
prisoner
is
saying
to
the
state
courts
could
as...
as...
as
reasonably
be
interpreted
as
stating
a
state
law
claim.
and
some
courts
have
held
that
a
federal
claim
is
fairly
presented
even
when
the
statement
of
the
claim
is
clearly
a
claim
under
state
law
only.
this
continuing...
and
in
this...
in
this
case--
mr.
hardy
myers
--your
honor,
i
was
about
to
describe
it
is
a
transformation
of
the
responsibility
of
the
state
prisoner
to
present
his
claim,
a
transformation
of
that
into
a
responsibility
of
the...
of
the
state
court...
state
courts
to,
in
effect,
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
state
prisoner
and
complete
or
try
to
complete
an
incompletely
presented
claim.
this...
this
overall
division
among
the
circuits
and
this
case
from
the
ninth
circuit,
we
think,
your
honors,
illustrates
or
confirms
very
strongly
the
need
for
further
clarification
by
this
court
as
to
exactly
what
must
be
said
by--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes.
we
believe
that
is
so,
so
long
as--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes,
your
honors,
so--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
part
of
the
test
that
we
propose--
mr.
hardy
myers
--well,
we
are
referring
to
necessarily,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
the...
the
source
of
the
claim,
that
is
its
federal
source,
is--
mr.
hardy
myers
--is
unmistake--
mr.
hardy
myers
--your
honor,
we
think
that
the
state
court--
mr.
hardy
myers
--no,
your
honor,
and
we
would
be
quite
content--
mr.
hardy
myers
--no,
your
honor.
inasmuch
as--
mr.
hardy
myers
--not...
not
necessarily--
mr.
hardy
myers
--your
honor,
it
would...
the...
a
federal
source
of
the
claim
would
have
been
identified,
but,
of
course,
whatever
further
clarification
the
court
might
consider
adopting
or
adopt,
the
balance
of
the
statement
of
the
claim
also
has
to
meet
the
requirements
of
fair
presentation.
mr.
hardy
myers
no,
your
honor,
because
the
description
of
the
claim
that
you
just
gave,
apart
from
whether
it's
factually
adequate
or
whatever
could
as...
could
equally
address,
or
state
a
claim
under
state
law.
mr.
hardy
myers
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
your
honor,
when
state
judicial
authority
is
invoked
to
address
a
claim
before
it,
it's
of
paramount
importance
for
that
court
to
know
whether
it
is
addressing
a
state
claim--
mr.
hardy
myers
--no,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to--
mr.
hardy
myers
--and,
your
honor,
as
i
was
saying
a
few
moments
ago,
it...
the
answer
to
that
goes
to
the
fact...
or
rests
on
the
fact
that
the
state
court's
authority
to
address
a
state
law-based
claim
is
very
different,
of
course,
from
its
authority
to
address
a
federal
law-based
claim.
it
has
the
ability
to
judge
and
decide
the
state
law
claim
any
way
it...
it
thinks
is
correct
under
state
law.
it
must,
of
course,
in
the
relation
to
a
federal
claim,
follow
the
precedents
faithfully
of
this
court--
mr.
hardy
myers
--but,
your
honor,
the...
the...
the
authority
issue
is
crucial,
because
if
the
state
court
does
not
know
whether
it,
in
fact,
has
a
state
law
claim
before
it,
it
does
not
know
whether
it
has
the
prerogative
in
that
case
to
change
the
rule.
mr.
hardy
myers
your
honor,
i...
i
would
still
assert
respectfully
that
the...
the...
the
clarity
with
which
the
claim
is
presented
in
terms
of
making
clear
whether
there
is
a
state
claim
or
a
federal
claim
present
is
still
of
great
importance,
because
the
state
court
can
still
change
its
decision
with
respect
to
the
state
claim
if
it
is
a
state
claim.
mr.
hardy
myers
well,
your
honor,
with
respect,
we
do
think
that
there
is
unfairness
if
it
is
not
absolutely
and
explicitly
clear
to
the
court
that
a
federal
claim
is
being
presented
by
a
state
court.
mr.
hardy
myers
no,
because
it--
mr.
hardy
myers
--but
it
could,
in
the
sense
that
they
might
want
to
change
their
position
or
interpretation
with
respect
to
state
law.
mr.
hardy
myers
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
hardy
myers
well,
because
we
think
at...
again,
your
honor,
we
think...
not
only
do
i
still
feel
the
authority
issue,
very
respectfully,
is
important,
but
also
our
whole
approach
toward
fair
presentation
of
federal
claims
places
a
choice
on
the
petitioner
to
make
as
to
whether
or
not
to
assert
a
federal
claim.
mr.
hardy
myers
no,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
there
is--
mr.
hardy
myers
--for
federal
habeas?
mr.
hardy
myers
yes,
i...
well,
like
indigent
federal
habeas,
yes,
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i...
i--
mr.
hardy
myers
--no,
not--
mr.
hardy
myers
--in
federal
court,
no,
your
honor.
they...
they
are--
mr.
hardy
myers
--they
would--
mr.
hardy
myers
--they
would
probably
be
federal,
yes.
but
they
are--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
no,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
no,
your
honor.
in
the...
in
the
habeas
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
we
focused
solely
on
the
issue
of
the
adequacy
of
that...
of
the
identification
of
the
claim
as
federal
in
nature.
mr.
hardy
myers
your
honor--
mr.
hardy
myers
--your
honor,
in
this
case,
we
made
a
choice
to
concentrate
or
focus
on
the
issue
of
the...
of
the
sufficiency
of
the...
of
the
identification
of
the
claim
as
federal,
and
we
maintained
that
as
the
focus
and
that
was
the...
the
focus
of
the
petition,
of
course,
for--
mr.
hardy
myers
--in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor,
inasmuch
as
we
have
not
appealed
from...
we
have
not
made
that
an
issue
below
and
appealed
from
it.
we
have
asked
for
review
solely
confined
to
the
issue
of
the
adequate...
the
adequacy
of
the...
of
the
sufficiency
of
the...
of
the
identification
of
the
claim
as
federal
in
nature.
if
i
could--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
it...
well,
your
honor,
we
don't...
yes.
we
don't
believe
that
it's
formalistic
inasmuch
as
a
claim
so
described
could
equally
describe
a
violation
of,
conceivably,
i
suppose,
state
statute,
but
certainly
a
state
constitution.
and
i
think
it's
at
the
very
heart
of
the
whole
notion
of...
of...
of
federalism
or
comity,
as
applied
in
habeas,
that
this
court
enforce
the
reality
that
we
have
state
constitutions
that
are
offering
protections--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would--
mr.
hardy
myers
--i...
i
may
have
misunderstood
the...
that
interpretation,
your
honor,
because
i
thought
this
was
still
a
very
much
open
question
as
to
whether--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes,
i
understand.
and
in
the
habeas
context--
mr.
hardy
myers
--well,
if
i
am
understanding
it
correctly,
your
honor,
i
would
very
much
advocate
for
the
court
not
extending...
i'm
understanding
it
correctly...
not
extending
that...
that
doctrine
or
view,
if
you
will,
into
the
habeas
context.
mr.
hardy
myers
it
is,
your
honor,
to
assure
that
the
states
have
a
meaningful
first
response...
opportunity
to
consider
federal
attacks
on
their
convictions,
and
to--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
yes,
your
honor,
by
statute--
mr.
hardy
myers
--in
the
post-conviction
relief
process,
yes.
mr.
hardy
myers
always,
by
statute.
there
is
one
further
reason
also
i'd
like
to
mention
to
the
court
for
not
adopting
a
view
that
generally
says,
if
a
state
court's
interpretation
of
a
particular
assertion
of...
of
a...
of
a
right,
and
the
federal
interpretation
are
the
same,
therefore
the
federal
claim
has
been
presented
automatically.
and
that
is
that
i
think
that
represents
a
very
transitory
rule
for
the
court
to
adopt
inasmuch
as
the
state
interpretation
of
its
own
law
could
change
at
a
given
point
in
time,
and
thus,
in
a
given
jurisdiction,
what
was
congruent
ceases
to
be
congruent.
this
court's
interpretation
of
federal
law
could
change
so
that,
again,
where
there
might
have
been
congruencies
before,
they...
they
have
now
become
incongruent,
and--
mr.
hardy
myers
--yes,
i
think
they
would
be
aware
of
them,
your
honor.
but
also
to
come
back
to
a
point
that
justice
scalia
made,
it...
there
could
be
also
renewed
and
further
issues
as
to
whether
there
has
been
a
change,
whether
they
are
congruent
or
not
congruent--
mr.
hardy
myers
--well,
i
think
it
could
go
either
way,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
yes.
mr.
hardy
myers
yes,
that's
correct.
any
event,
with
the
present
state
of
the
law
within
the
circuits,
and
in
light
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
your
honors,
we
very
much
hope
that
this
court
will
take
the
opportunity
in
this
case
to
both
reaffirm
that
it
is
the
petitioner's
responsibility
to
set
forth,
to
choose
and
to
set
forth
his
federal
claim
as
federal,
and
that
you
will
provide
further
guidance
as
to
how
that
must
occur.
that
furthers
clarification
can
certainly
work
to
serve
all
the
interests
that
are
at
stake
here,
a
true
meaningful
opportunity
for
the
states
to
be
able
to...
to
have
the
first
opportunity
to
decide
the
federal
questions.
it
can
reduce
the
amount
of
litigation
that
is
occurring
around
the
exhaustion
issue,
and,
i
think...
and...
and
save
precious
resources,
and
i
think,
your
honors,
that
a
clear,
further...
a
further
clarification
of
the
rule
will
actually
serve
the
interests
of
petitioners
by
make...
bringing
meritorious
federal
claims
to...
to
decision
more...
sooner
and
more
consistently.
mr.
hardy
myers
actually,
your
honor,
in
the
petition
for
review
in
oregon,
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
included,
but
that
in
this
case
was
a
summary
affirmance
of
the...
of
the
trial
court's
decision.
mr.
hardy
myers
yes,
that's--
mr.
hardy
myers
--i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
well,
insofar
as
that
stage
is
concerned,
the...
the...
the
papers
that
were
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
advise
or
tell
that
court
that
a
federal
question
was
being
raised,
a
federal
claim
was
being
raised.
there
was
simply
a
claim
of
inadequate
assistance
of
appellate
counsel,
but
there
was
no
indication
that...
whether
that
was
a
state
claim,
state
law-based
claim
or
a
federal
law-based
claim.
and
both
state
and
federal
law-based
claims
of
inadequate
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
had
been...
had
been
raised
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
petition
at
the
trial
stage.
mr.
hardy
myers
i
do.
thank
you.
mr.
hardy
myers
your
honor,
so
two
quick
comments
or
points.
first,
this
case
illustrates
the
fallacy
of
any
kind
of
doctrine
which
says
that
a
appellate
court
can
tell
what
issues
have
been
chosen
to
be
asserted
to
it,
put
before
it,
by
going
back
and
looking
at
the
decision
of
a...
of
a
lower
court.
here,
the
trial
court
in
oregon
disposed
of
one
of
the
federal
inappellate
assistance
of
counsel
claims,
citing
jones
against
barnes,
but
it
had
before
it
state
law
claims
of
inappellate...
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
as
well
as
federal.
the
trial
court
didn't
mention
the
state
claims,
but
they
were
all
dismissed
as
well
by
the
judgment
that
was
ultimately
entered
at
the
trial
court
level.
so
both
state
and
federal
claims
were
dismissed.
you
couldn't
tell
by
looking
at
the
trial
court
judgment
what
the...
what
the
prisoner
was
choosing
to
actually
assert
among
those
dismissed
claims
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
he
could
as
well
have
been
asserting
his
dismissed
state
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
mr.
hardy
myers
no.
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
hardy
myers
it...
at
page
47-48
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
you
may
have
already
been
referring
to--
mr.
hardy
myers
--the
petition
for
review
is
set
forth.
and
if
you
go
to
the
argument
portion,
your
honor,
which
is
at
the
very...
second
paragraph
of
the
argument
portion,
i
think
that's
going
to
be
on
page
48.
mr.
hardy
myers
you'll
see
the
last...
second
sentence
of
the
second
paragraph:
moreover,
since
petitioner
asserts
he
was
coerced
and
threatened
by
counsel
to
waive
his
right
to
trial
by
jury,
petitioner
believes
his
fifth,
sixth,
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
have
been--
mr.
hardy
myers
--have
been
violated.
so...
so
the
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
claim
was
specifically
federalized,
if
you
will,
and
that's
the...
that's
the
only
place
where
those
federal
citations
appear.
mr.
hardy
myers
your
honors,
again,
the...
the
state
of
the
law
in
this
area,
we
think,
can
fairly
be
described
as
still
disturbed,
a
term
i
used
earlier,
and
we
very
sincerely
hope
that
this
court
will
use
this
case
both
in
relation
to
the
ninth
circuit
decision
to
reaffirm
that
it
is
the
state
petitioner,
not
the
state
courts,
who
have
the
responsibility
to
assert...
fairly
present
the
claim,
and
secondly,
to
go
for
further...
and
further
clarify
specifically
what
state
prisoners
must
do
in
order
to
clearly
indicate
the
federal
source
of
their
claim--
mr.
hardy
myers
--your
honor,
indeed,
the
fact
that
federal...
or
that
the
federal
source
of
the
claim
is
used
is
not
the
end
of
the
fair
presentation
issue,
because
there's
still
going
to
be
the
ongoing
requirement
of
adequately
identifying
your
substance
of
your
claim,
to
use
the
terminology
of
this
court,
the...
the
legal
theory
as
well
as
the
adequacy
of
the
fact.
