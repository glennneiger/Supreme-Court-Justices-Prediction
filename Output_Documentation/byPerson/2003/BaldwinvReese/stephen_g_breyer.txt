justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
a
given
proposition
of
law
that
a
state
prisoner
who
wants
a
writ
of
federal
habeas
corpus
first
has
to
exhaust
his
remedies
in
the
state
court.
it
is
also
given
that
in
doing
so,
he
has
to
“fairly
present”
his
federal
claims,
as
law
claims
it
federal
law,
in
each
relevant
state
court
and
that
includes
the
state
supreme
court
if
he
tries
to
go
to
the
state
supreme
court.
now,
this
case
involves
a
state
prisoner,
michael
reese,
who
filed
a
petition
for
review
in
the
state’s
system
that
of
his
convictions,
review
of
his
conviction,
including
the
state
supreme
court,
and
then
later
on,
he
wanted
federal
habeas
corpus.
the
federal
district
court
held
that
his
state
supreme
court
petition
did
not
fairly
present
one
of
his
federal
claims,
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
now,
when
it
did
so,
it
determined
that
state
supreme
court
petition
was
not
proper.
it
did
not
properly
made
clear
to
that
state
supreme
court
what
the
prisoner’s
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
was.
it
did
not
make
clear
that
it
was
a
federal
claim.
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
well,
that
does
not
really
matter.
it
said
that
the
justices
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
could
have
looked
at
papers
filed
in
the
lower
oregon
courts,
and
also
decisions
of
the
lower
oregon
courts,
and
if
they
had
done
so,
they
would
have
realized
that
the
prisoner’s
claim
was
a
federal
claim,
a
claim
of
federal
law.
we
now
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
we
think
that
state
supreme
court
justices
like
other
judges
have
full
dockets.
they
may
read
the
papers
or
decisions
filed
in
the
lower
court
but
they
may
not.
it
all
depends
on
the
case.
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
would
basically
say
they
always
have
to
read
those
lower
court
papers,
it
would
change
ordinary
state
judicial
practice,
it
would
impose
a
serious
burden
upon
state
appellate
judges,
and
it
would
do
very
little
to
advance
the
fairness
of
federal
habeas
proceedings.
that
is
because
it
really
is
not
difficult
for
a
litigant
who
wishes
to
raise
a
federal
claim
in
a
state
court
to
make
clear
to
the
state
court
that
his
claim
in
his
brief
or
the
other
documents
he
filed
is
a
federal
claim.
we
consequently
hold
the
ordinarily,
a
state
prisoner
in
order
to
fairly
present
a
federal
claim
to
a
state
court
has
to
do
so
in
his
brief
filed
in
that
court.
now,
reese
then
argues
in
the
alternative
that
anyway
his
petition
that
he
did
file
in
the
oregon
supreme
court
did
fairly
present
his
federal
ineffective
assistance
claim
right
there
in
the
petition,
because
at
least
it
made
clear
it
was
some
kind
of
ineffective
assistance
claim,
let
us
say
a
state
claim,
and
state
law
and
federal
law
are
the
same
in
respect
to
ineffective
assistance.
but
reese
did
not
raise
this
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals,
nor
in
his
opposition
here.
in
fact,
it
made
its
appearance
for
the
first
time
in
its
brief
on
the
merits
and
under
our
rules,
we
can
consider
such
tardily
raised
arguments
to
have
been
waived
and
we
do
consider
it
waived
here.
for
these
reasons,
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
