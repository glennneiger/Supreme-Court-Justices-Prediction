unknown
speaker
well,
we're
reviewing
a
ninth
circuit
holding,
which
seems
fairly
open-ended.
how
would
you
characterize
the
ninth
circuit
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
with
your
opponents
here
on
at
least
some
of
the
ground
rules
that
would
suffice?
i
mean,
is
it
enough
to
cite
a
federal
constitutional
provision
or
a
federal
statute
or
other
provision
describing
the
right
as
federal?
you're
both
in
agreement
that
would
do?
unknown
speaker
how
about
if
you
cite
at
least
a...
a
reported
case
that
has
decided
the
claim
on
a
federal
basis?
you
make
your
claim
and
cite
a
case
that--
unknown
speaker
--clearly
has
decided
the
claim
on
a
federal
basis.
is
that...
you're
both
in
agreement
that
would
do?
unknown
speaker
and
what
if
a...
a
claim
is
spelled
out
that
necessarily
must
be
based
on
a
federal
right
to
exist
at
all?
unknown
speaker
why
yes?
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
why
is
it
necessarily
a
federal
claim?
it's
necessarily
a
federal
claim
only
if
it's
a
valid
claim.
it
might
be
an
erroneous
state
claim.
unknown
speaker
who--
--but
the...
the--
unknown
speaker
--he
hasn't
read
the
state
constitution.
he...
he
makes
a
due
process
claim.
now,
you're...
you're
going
to
say,
since
there
is
no
due
process
clause
in
the
state
constitution,
but
there
is
in
the
federal
constitution,
we
must
assume
it's
a
federal
claim.
why?
it
may
be
an
erroneous
state
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
i
don't
want
to
have
to
go
through
the
trouble
of
figuring
out
whether
there's
a
valid
state
claim.
i...
i
mean,
this
is
going
to
require
a
federal
court
every
time
there's
such
a
claim
to
go
through
state
law
and
determine
whether
there
is
anything
to
this
under
state
law.
why
should...
why
should
we
do
that?
why,
i
mean,
why
aren't
your
first
two
requirements
enough?
look
at...
cite
a
federal
case,
cite
a
federal
provision.
is...
is
this
an
enormous
burden?
unknown
speaker
so
why
do
you
want
to
add
anything
to
it?
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
really
understand
going
beyond
that.
let
me
ask
you
the
other...
the
contrary
question.
suppose
the...
the
prisoner
alleges,
i
had
a
lawyer
who
didn't
even
graduate
from
law
school,
and
because
i
had
such
a
law...
lousy
lawyer,
i
lost
the
case
and
i'm
in
jail,
and
i
would
be
innocent
if
i
were
not
in
jail,
but
he
doesn't
cite
any
cases
or
any
constitutional
provision.
would
that
have...
present
a
federal
claim?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
so?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
if
he
added,
and
therefore,
it
violated
the
federal
constitution,
then
it
would
be
a
federal
claim?
unknown
speaker
but
why...
why
doesn't
the
state
judge
know
he's
raising
a
claim
of
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
that
violates
the
federal
constitution?
doesn't
that
give
the
state
judge
a
fair
opportunity
to
decide
the
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly--
--but
that
anybody
knows--
--but
the
question
is
whether
it
states
a
federal
claim
that
has
been
exhausted.
doesn't
it
also
state
a
federal
claim?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
thought
the
federal
standards...
and
i
was
going
to
get
into
this,
but
let's
do
it
in
relation
to
justice
stevens'
hypothetical...
i
thought
the
federal
standards
and
the
state
standards
for
adequate
assistance
of
counsel
were...
were
in
substance
the
same,
and
in,
you
know,
in
oregon.
and...
and
if
they
are
the
same,
why
is
it
unfair
to
the
state
or
to
the
state
courts
to
construe
a...
a...
a
statement
like
the
one
justice
stevens
just
read,
as
stating
a
federal
as
well
as
a
state
claim?
the
court
is
going
to
do
the
same
thing
no
matter
how
it
construes
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
my--
--well,
we...
we
need
to
lay
down
a
rule,
i
think,
that
is...
can
be
applied
generally
and
not
just
to
oregon,
so
that,
of
course,
a
peculiarity
of
oregon
law
ought
not
to
control
what
we're
trying
to
do
in
making
a
more
general
statement.
unknown
speaker
may...
maybe
i
didn't
make
my...
my
point.
my...
my
point
was,
if
a
claim
is
stated
as
a
matter
of
fact,
which
under
the
law
of
the
state
and
the
law
of
the
united
states
is
governed
by
identical
standards,
what
is
unfair
about
construing
that
as
a
federal
as
well
as
a
state
claim,
regardless
of
what
label
is
put
on
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i'm...
my...
the...
the...
my...
my
question
assumed
that
the...
that
the
substantive
law
governing
the
claim
was
the
same
under...
under
the
state
system
and
under
the
federal
system.
so
my
assumption
is
that
you're
going
to
get
the
same
result,
and
the
result
is
going
to
be
equally
right
or
equally
wrong,
regardless
of...
of...
of
whether
you
construe
it
as
a
state
claim
and
a
federal
claim.
unknown
speaker
suppose--
--well,
it--
--oregon
had
said
in
prior
decisions,
as
states
sometimes
do
in
dealing
with
constitutional
provisions,
we
interpret
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
in
our
state
to
be
strictly
in
tune
with
the
way
the
supreme
court
interprets
inadequate
or
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
that
is,
our
state
standard
is
the
same,
identical,
to
the
federal,
so
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
there
being
a
difference
between
the
state
law
and
the
federal
law.
the...
the
state
supreme
court
has
said,
we
take
our
lead
from
the
federal
definition.
unknown
speaker
sure
it
can,
but
the
question
is,
what
does
it
know
when
it
sets
out
to
adjudicate
the
case?
is
it
fairly
on
notice
at
day
one
on
a
premise
like
justice
ginsburg's
that
the
claim
is
equally
state
or
federal?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
on
a
premise
like
hers,
of
course
the
state
can
fairly
say
the
law
is
the
same,
doesn't
matter
at
this
point
whether...
whether
i
call
it
state
or
whether
i
call
it
federal,
so
it's
fair
to
assume
it's
both.
if
the
state
court,
let's
say
the
state
supreme
court,
later
on
says,
we
think
we'll
change
our
rule,
then
all
the
state
court
has
to
do
is
to
say,
the
claim
is
either
good
or
bad
under
federal
law
and
this...
the
result
is
now
going
to
be
different
under
state
law.
but
the
state
courts
at
each
stage
on
a
premise
like
justice
ginsburg
is
fairly
on
notice
of
what
it
has
to
decide.
there's
no
unfairness
to
it.
that's
the
point
that
we're
getting
at,
and
i...
and
i
don't
understand
your
answer
when
you
say
it's
important
for
them
to
know
the
source
if
there's
no
unfairness.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
because
it's
just
nice
to
know?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
law.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in...
in
the
standards
by
which
they
would
go
about
adjudicating
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that...
the
change
in
position
to
allow
the
claim.
but
we're
only
concerned
with
cases
in
which
the
state
has
denied
relief.
if
you
could...
if
the
state
grants
relief,
there's
no
exhaustion
problem.
he
got
the
relief.
unknown
speaker
and
so
if
he's
denied
relief
without
knowing
whether
it's
federal
or
state,
is
there
any
possibility
that
if
it
were
refiled,
and
clearly
named
federal
constitution
as
the
background,
he
would
then
grant
relief?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
it
could
possibly
happen.
if
the
rules
are
the
same,
he
made
a
conscientious
examination,
they
claim,
and
said,
you
lose.
if
he
came
back
and
added
the
words,
cited
some
federal
case,
he'd
still
lose.
so
why
hasn't
the
state
had
a
fair
opportunity
to
consider
that
claim
and
the
interests
of
federal
is
in
par
not,
why
are
they
not
accommodated
by
that...
by
just
saying,
if
you...
if
you
made
a
claim
that's
clearly
federal
on
its
facts
and
you've
had
a
chance
to
decide
it,
why...
why
shouldn't
that...
that
not
count...
be
sufficient
exhaustion?
unknown
speaker
general
myers,
doesn't
the
burden
on
the
habeas
court
have
anything
to
do
with
this?
if...
if
this
hypothesis
is
adopted,
the
habeas
court
will
have
to,
i
suppose,
consider
the
facts
and
determine
whether
that
statement
of
facts
makes
out
a
federal
claim
or
not,
thing
one.
thing
two,
the
federal
habeas
court
will
then
have
to
examine
state
court,
a
state
law,
to
assure
itself
that
state
law
and
federal
law,
with
regard
to
this
matter,
are
exactly
the
same.
and
all
of
this
is
in
order
to
save
the
habeas
petitioner
what
burden?
the
burden
of
saying
federal
claim
when
he
files
his...
his
complaint.
what...
does
it
seem
to
you
a
close
question
who
should
bear
that
burden?
unknown
speaker
how
often
are
these
habeas--
unknown
speaker
--petitioners
represented
by
counsel
in
oregon?
is
this...
are...
is
counsel
regularly
appointed
for
federal
habeas
petitioners?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know
that?
in...
in
the
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
in...
in
the
federal
court
you
think
they're
routinely
appointed
by
the
state?
unknown
speaker
a
federal
habeas
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
up
to
the
federal
rules.
unknown
speaker
and
must...
must
the
petitioner
seeking
habeas
relief
also
fairly
present
the
factual
basis
for
the
claim?
unknown
speaker
was
that
done
here?
unknown
speaker
and
did
the
state
point
that
out
alone?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
the
petition
contains
no
facts,
you
wouldn't
point
that
out?
i...
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
you
say,
but
there
are
no
facts?
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
facts
were
presented
when
indeed
none
were?
unknown
speaker
may
i...
may
i
go
back
to
the
question--
--just
to
make
it
clear
where...
where
your...
what
your
rule
is,
the
very
asset
justice
o'connor
said,
does
it
suffice
if
you
cite
a
constitutional
provision,
a
case,
a...
a
formulation.
and
then
we
had
another
discussion,
but
that
was
only
part
of
your
test,
because
you
also,
i
take
it,
assert
that
you...
that
the
petitioner
must
set
forth
the
factual
basis
for
its
claim...
for
his
claim?
unknown
speaker
so
that
that's
a
two-part
test.
it...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
some
cases
it's
going
to
be
fairly
obvious
what
the
facts
are
and
in
some
cases
it's
fairly
obvious
what
the
legal
standard
is,
and
depending.
in
the
case
that
justice
stevens
puts,
where
he
alleges
just
the
facts
that
his...
that
his
lawyer
was
not
even
a
lawyer
and...
and
indicates
why
it
was
ineffective,
but...
but
doesn't
cite
a
federal
provision,
it
seems
to
me
any
judge
knows
you
have
to
have
adequate
assistance
of
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment,
and
that
in
the
case
put
by
justice
stevens,
it
is
simply
a
formalistic
requirement.
now,
it
may
be
that
you're
going
to
say,
although
it's
formalistic
in
some
cases,
it's
necessary
to
run
the
habeas
system
that
we
have
this
rule.
is...
is...
is
the
latter
your
position?
unknown
speaker
we
certainly
enforce
it
with
respect
to
people
raising
claims
in
our
court.
we
require
very
specifically
that
they
refer
to
a
specific
source
of
federal
law
before
we
will
even
decide
it.
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
case
decided,
the
fitzgerald
case,
which
is
cited
in
page
34
of
the
red
brief,
it
was
just
last
term,
when...
when
this
court
said
that
the
court
would
consider
a
state
court
decision
as
relying
on
federal
grounds
sufficient
to
support
this
court's
jurisdiction,
if
under
the
state's
decisional
law,
the
state
and
the
federal
constitutional
claim
are
treated
identically,
the
content
of
the
right
is
treated
identically.
that...
that
decision
from
just
last
term
says,
you've
got
a
claim
out
there
and
it's
a
constitutional
claim
and
the
federal
law
and
state
law
are
identical,
the
content
of
the
law
is
identical,
we
will
treat
it
as
federal.
that
was
a
decision
just
from
last
term.
unknown
speaker
this
was
not
in
the
habeas
context.
unknown
speaker
and
it...
what
i
read
to
you
is...
is
from
the
decision
itself.
the
court
will
consider
a
state
court
decision
as
relying
upon
federal
grounds
sufficient
to
support
the
court's
jurisdiction.
that
is,
when
the
state
courts
have
in
other
cases
declared
that
they
will
apply
the
same
analysis
in
considering
the
state
constitutional
claim
as
the
federal
courts
would,
i
think
in
that
case
it
was
equal
protection.
but
the...
the
court...
that
was
critical
to
the
court's
deciding
that
case
last
term.
unknown
speaker
it
had
to
do
with
jurisdiction,
not
with
pleading.
there
was
pled
in
the
case
a
violation
of
federal
law.
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
person
before
the
court
was
claiming
a
violation
of
federal
law.
what
the
case
held
was
that
there
is
jurisdiction
because
the...
we
will
assume
that
the
state
court
made
a
ruling
on
a
question
of
federal
law
where
it
relies
on
state
law
that
looks
to
federal
cases.
that's
quite
different
from
the
pleading
question
that
you
have
before
you.
may
i
ask
you
what
you
understand
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
exhaustion
requirement?
unknown
speaker
do
you...
do
you
think
the
hypothetical
that
i
gave
you
would
give
a
state
court
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
decide
the
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
then
it
would
seem
we
would
follow
the
exhaustion
requirement
is
satisfied.
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
to
the
question
of
appointment
of
counsel?
is
counsel
routinely
appointed
for
state
petitioners
in
the
state
courts
of
oregon--
unknown
speaker
--for
state
habeas--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
it's
likely
that
federal
judges
sitting
in
the
state
would
be
aware
of
those
changes?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
thinking
of
changes
that
are
favorable
to
the
claimant
or
favorable
to
the
state?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
if
it's
favorable
to
the
claimant,
it
couldn't
cause
any
harm.
it's
only
if
you
make
it
narrower
that
it
would
make
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
in
every
case
where
the
federal
habeas
court
has
some
doubt
whether
a
federal
claim
was
raised,
the
federal
habeas
court,
that
is,
where
it
is
not
explicitly
stated,
the
federal
habeas
court
will
have
to
inquire
into
state
law
to
see
whether
it
is
indeed
congruent
with
federal
law.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
was
wrong
with
the
ninth
circuit's
position,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
intermediate
appellate
court?
that
is,
it's
reviewing
a
decision
of
a
court
below.
that
court
below
has
federal
written
all
over
it.
why
isn't
that
a...
a
reasonable
assumption
that
the...
that
the
intermediate
appellate
court
where
there
is
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
right,
it's
reviewing
a
decision,
it's
bound
to
read
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
talking
about
the
court...
the
supreme
court
of
oregon.
i
think
justice
ginsburg
was
asking
about
the
oregon
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
the...
the
appeal
from
the
trial
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
do
you
wish
to
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time,
general
myers?
unknown
speaker
very
well.
mr.
balske,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
the
trial
court,
correct?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to...
you
agree
you
have
to
present
the
claim
all
the
way
up
through
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
were...
there
were
two...
there
was
a
petition
and
an
amended
position,
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
unknown
speaker
and
the...
the
original
petition
did
not
recite
the...
the
factual
basis
to
support
the
claim.
that
was
only
in
the
amended
petition,
and
the
amended
petition
was
not...
the
amended
petition,
i...
i
take
it,
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
was...
was
the
one
in
which
the
allegation
of
conflict
of
interest
and
the
precise
reasons
for
it
was
cited.
that
seems
to
drop
out
of
the
case
because
then
it's
not...
that
amended
petition,
which
contained
the
factual
basis,
is...
is
not
incorporated
or
cited
to
the
court
of...
the
state
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
no,
you're...
you're...
you
refer
to
a
clear
statement
rule.
is
that
a
rule
of
oregon
law--
unknown
speaker
--or
a
rule
of
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
and
what
does...
what
does
it...
what
does
that...
what's
the
case
for
it,
and
what
does
it
say?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
did...
did...
did
the
order
of
the
oregon
trial
court
specify
the
facts
upon
which
the
federal
claim
was--
unknown
speaker
--was
based?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right,
but
it
wasn't,
okay?
i
mean,
i'm
in
an
appeals
court,
i've
a
lot
to
do--
unknown
speaker
--thousands
of
cases.
there
are
judgments
of
all
sorts
below.
i
don't
read
the
judgments
when
i
have
thousands
of
cases.
i
look
and
see,
what
is
this
individual
complaining
about?
unknown
speaker
so
i
look
to
see
what
the
arguments
are
that
he's
making
that
the
lower
court
made
a
mistake.
now,
if
i
was
in
the
supreme
court
of
oregon,
and
i
thought,
but
i
lost
this,
that
you
shouldn't
have
to
present
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
oregon,
but
the
rule
is
you
do.
unknown
speaker
all
right?
well,
i'm
there
as
a
busy
judge,
i
look
at
it,
he
makes
no
mention
of
the
federal
claim,
goodbye,
that's
the
end
of
it.
i
don't
look
up
at
the
federal
claim.
so...
what...
what...
why...
how
could
we
hold
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
but
all
that
tells
me
is
that
somewhere
in
this
brief
they're
cited,
that's
the
table
of
authorities
they
cite.
that
isn't
what
the
argument
is.
unknown
speaker
so
if
i'm
going
to
look
to
see
what
the
argument
is,
i'll
try
to
turn
the
page
and--
unknown
speaker
--where
does
it
say
he's
making
the
argument--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
have
to
have
your
reasons
why
they're
wrong
and
so
on?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
i...
i
couldn't
possibly
tell
from
this
what...
what
the
case
was
about,
other
than
some
free-floating
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
case.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
are
you
saying
that
oregon
rules
make
it
optional
as
to
whether
he's
going
to
tell
me
what
the
case
is
about?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
no
facts.
i
mean,
if
you're
in
the
federal
habeas
court,
why
aren't
you
just
out
right
there
for
having
no
facts?
unknown
speaker
but
it...
but
the
point
is--
unknown
speaker
--as
i
understand
my
colleague's
question,
if
the
judge
sees
that
there
are
no
facts
set
out,
why
doesn't
the
judge
just
say,
you're
out
of
here?
unknown
speaker
but
think
he
would
say
that
on
the
basis
of
oregon
procedural
law
that--
unknown
speaker
--you...
you
just
haven't
said
anything.
unknown
speaker
okay.
what...
what...
what
is
the
hardship
for
a...
for
a
petitioner
in
pcr
oregon--
unknown
speaker
--to
either
say,
i'm
relying
on
section,
you
know,
article
xiv
of
the
united
states
constitution,
or
i'm
relying
on
some
federal
case.
i
mean,
that...
that
just
seems
a
very
minimal
requirement.
unknown
speaker
what's...
what's
hard
about
that?
unknown
speaker
could...
can
you
answer
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
how
sharp
do
you
have
to
be
to
figure
that
out?
unknown
speaker
no,
where...
are...
are
you
reading
from
some...
in
the
brief?
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
touche.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i...
i
think
it's...
it's...
it's
common
to,
you
know,
you've
heard
of
the
incorporation
doctrine,
which
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporates
and
applies
to
the
states
the
first
ten
amendments,
or
at
least
portions
of
the
first
ten
amendments.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
not
inaccurate
to
say
that...
that
it's
a
sixth
amendment
right,
which
has
been
applied
to
the
states
via
the
fourteenth.
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
if
the
oregon
constitution
happened
to
contain
the
right
in
the
same
number
amendment,
like
the
sixth
was...
they
were
both
sixth
amendment.
then
you
have
to
say
sixth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
or
is
this...
is
this
one
of
the
ones
that
it
doesn't
contain
it
in
the
oregon
constitution
sixth
amendment
so
this
is
one
of
the
ones
that,
by
necessity,
must
refer
to.
unknown
speaker
but
the...
the
court
of
appeals--
unknown
speaker
--thought
that
the
only
way
in
which
this
claim
was
properly
presented
was
if
they
adopted,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
the
rule,
that
the
state
court
is
deemed
to
have
read
and
understood
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court.
am
i...
am
i
right
about--
unknown
speaker
--that
formulation
of
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
defend
that
as
the
test?
unknown
speaker
it...
it's
a...
do
you
defend--
unknown
speaker
--the
ninth
circuit's--
unknown
speaker
--articulated
test?
unknown
speaker
in
your--
unknown
speaker
--right.
in...
in
your
opinion,
as
a
lawyer
who,
i
take
it,
is
involved
in
these
things--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
really
a
big
problem
of
differences
among
the
lower
circuits...
among
the
lower
courts?
to
what
extent
do
we
have
to
find
a
rule?
i
take
it
the
rule
now
is
called
fair
presentation?
unknown
speaker
and
there
are
dozens
of
ways
it
could
be
done.
and
so
the
court
is
just
like...
supposed
to
look
at
the
individual
circumstance,
say
was
it
done,
was
it
not
done?
here
you
think
it
was
done
because
the
whole
thing's
two
pages,
they
refer
to
the
federal
constitution
in
the...
in
the
citation
of
authorities,
and
they
have
no
particular,
et
cetera.
all
right.
now,
is
there
a
problem
or
isn't
there
a
problem
among
the
circuits
in
applying
this
fair
presentation
test?
unknown
speaker
is
it...
are
they
real
differences
in
terms
of
what
counts
or--
unknown
speaker
--are
they
just
differences
in--
unknown
speaker
--but
that...
that's
a
ninth
circuit
case,
isn't
it,
the...
duncan
against
henry?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
case
from
this
court?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
the
only--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
only
way
in
which
they
could
sustain
their
judgment
was
to
adopt
this
rule
of...
that
the
appellate
court
has
the
duty,
or
is
presumed
to
have
understood
what
happened
in
the
trial
court.
you
seem
to
agree
that
your
case
doesn't
have
to
turn
on
that.
the
ninth
circuit,
i
thought,
said
that
the
case
turned
on
that
proposition.
otherwise,
it
was
not
going
to
make
it.
and...
and
i
just
have
to...
i
can't
speak
for
my
colleagues--
unknown
speaker
--but
the...
the
petition
that
you
read
me
at
the
appendix,
where
that
just
cites
the
federal
constitutional
provision
and
then
says
ineffective
of
counsel...
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel...
does
not
give
the
court
any
clue
as
to
what
it's
supposed
to
do--
unknown
speaker
--other
than
to
review
a
record.
unknown
speaker
and...
and...
and
i
had
thought
the
exhaustion
requirement
was
designed
to
give
the
court
some
assistance
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
showed...
should
spend
more
time
with
the
case
in
order
to
review
the
record,
in
other
words,
said
that
counsel
had
a
conflict
of
interest
because
of
marriage
or
something.
it
would
have
been...
it
would
have...
it
would
have
been
triggered...
a...
a...
a
more
specific
review
by
the
district
court.
and
it
just...
by
the...
by
the
state
appellate
court...
and
it
just
didn't
have
that
information.
unknown
speaker
but
we
get
thousands
of
cases
around
here
that
just
says
fifth
amendment,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
that
gives
us
very,
very
little
help.
unknown
speaker
sixth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
argument
that
you're
making
now
that
inadequate
is
the
buzzword
for
a
state
claim,
ineffective
for
a
federal
claim,
is
at
least
in
tension
with
your
argument
that...
that
in...
with
respect
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
the
state...
the
content
of
the
state
standard
and...
is
identical
to
the
federal.
so
these
labels
don't
mean
anything
if
the
content
is
identical,
so
how--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
you...
you
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
approach
to
this
was
wrong,
which...
which
seems
to
be
anchored
in,
if
it's
clear
that
the
court
of
first
instance
relied
on
the
federal
ground,
that
stays
with
the
case
all
the
way
up.
you...
you
reject
that,
or
you
say,
you...
you
are
asking
us
to
affirm
the
judgment,
not
that
reasoning.
what
is
your
reasoning?
what
is
enough?
unknown
speaker
but
may
i--
--then
i
don't
see
how
that
differs
from
the
ninth
circuit--
--that's
the
ninth
circuit.
--because
you
have
to
start
with
the
court
of
first
instance,
and
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
the
court
of
first
instance
relies
on
a
federal
ground
that
stays
with
the
case.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
before
that
you
were
not
defending
the...
the
ninth
circuit's
approach.
unknown
speaker
now
you
tell
me
you
are.
i
thought
you
were
relying
upon
the
statement
in
the...
in
the
brief
to
the
supreme
court
that
he
was
relying
upon...
upon
the
federal
constitution.
unknown
speaker
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
if
you're
relying
on
that
now,
why
didn't
you
rely
on
it
in
your
brief
in
opposition?
the
question
presented
by
the
state
was,
does
a
state
prisoner
alert
the
state's
highest
court
that
he
is
raising
a
federal
claim
when,
in
that
court,
he
neither
cites
a
specific
provision
of
the
federal
constitution
nor
cites
at
least
one
authority
that
has
decided
the
claim
on
a
federal
basis?
why...
why
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--you
respond
to
that--
unknown
speaker
--by
simply
saying
the
question
is
not
presented
because,
in
fact,
he
did
cite
a
specific
provision
of
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
we're
wasting
our
time
here
if...
if
you
want
us
to
decide
whether
this
brief--
unknown
speaker
--you
know,
contains
the...
the
sixth
amendment
or
not.
the
question
we
granted
cert
on
is,
does
he
alert
it
when
he
neither...
neither
cites
a
specific
provision
of
the
federal
constitution
nor
cites
at
least
one
authority?
i...
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--what...
we're
just
spinning
our
wheels
here.
you...
you
said
you
did
raise
that
in
the
eio?
unknown
speaker
where?
unknown
speaker
i
need
to
go
back
to
it.
unknown
speaker
i've
just
looked
at
it.
i...
i
didn't
see
it.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
see
it
presented
very
clearly.
it
seems
to
me--
--all
right.
anyway,
what
you're
asking
is...
that's
why
i
started
at
the
beginning.
i
thought
the
question
was...
i
thought
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
cite
a
case
called
lyons,
and
in
lyons
they
say
you
do
have
to
either
cite
a
particular
provision
of
the
federal
constitution
or
a
case
that's
clearly
a
federal
case.
and
then
they
held
that
the
brief
you
pointed
out
to
me
did
not
do
that.
then
they
said,
but
anyway,
that
brief
is
good
enough
because
in
the
lower
courts
or
other
courts
they
had
cited
the
federal
constitution
explicitly.
now
on
that
question,
i
would
think
they're
wrong,
aren't
they?
because,
as
i
started
out,
you
can't
expect
judges
to
start
going
back
and
filing...
looking
through
all
the
briefs
they
filed
in
the
lower
courts,
or
the
opinions
below.
unknown
speaker
that
was,
i
thought,
the
question.
unknown
speaker
and
on
that
question,
do
you...
what
do
you
want
to
say?
i
mean,
if
you're--
unknown
speaker
--so...
so...
so
now
you're...
you're...
what
you...
in
order
to
win
your
case,
you're
going
to
have
to
give
us
a
standard,
and
your
standard
is,
it
seems
to
me,
that
state
appellate
courts
are
bound
to
look
at
the
pleadings
in
the
lower
courts.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
exhaustion
rule--
unknown
speaker
--depends
upon
whether
or
not
the
state
appellate
courts
had
fair
notice
of
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
that's...
that's
what
we're
trying
to
discuss
here
and--
--that
sounds--
--and
it...
and...
and
the...
and
the
only
way
you
can
save
your
case,
in
the
posture
that
comes
to
us,
as
i
see
it,
is
that
that
state
appellate
court
is
bound
to
look
at
the
pleadings
in
the...
in
the
court
of
first
instance.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
that
is
a
rule.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--you...
you...
if
you're
going
to
save
your
judgment,
we're
going
to
have
to
do
it
with
a
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
that
just
goes
to
the
trial
court's
judgment,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
but
how
does...
how
does
that
bear
on
the
appeal
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you're
really...
you
really
are
supporting
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment,
aren't
you...
opinion?
the...
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
should
have
looked
at
the
trial
court's
decision,
even
though
it's
a
court
where
the
review
is
discretionary
from
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
want--
unknown
speaker
--you
want
to
withdraw
your...
your
assurance
earlier
that
you
are
not
defending
the...
the
ninth
circuit's
basis
for
reaching
its
result,
but
just
the
result?
unknown
speaker
i...
i'm
certainly
confused.
i
don't
know
whether
you
are.
unknown
speaker
is...
is--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
think
you
need
the
ninth
circuit
if
you're
saying
the
following.
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
you're
saying
and
you
tell
me--
unknown
speaker
--whether
i'm
right.
[laughter]
at
the
court
of
appeals
level,
we
don't
need
the
ninth
circuit
rule
because
the
court
of
appeals
was
reviewing
a
trial
court
judgment
including
findings
and
statement
of
law
and
there
it
was
right
in
the
statement
of
law
referred
to,
federal.
number
two,
we
don't
need
the
ninth
circuit
rule
when
we
get
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
because
we've
got
a
petition
and
the
petition
says
federal,
refers
specifically
to
four
federal
amendments,
doesn't
refer
to
any
state
court,
any
state
law
or
any
state
constitution.
so
you
don't
need
the
ninth
circuit
rule
for
that
purpose.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
okay.
well,
then
you
have
the
problem--
--may
i
ask
you--
--of
the
ninth
circuit.
yes?
excuse
me,
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
is...
is
it
your
view
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
state
rule
on
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
federal
rule
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there's
a
difference,
would
your
client
not
have
had
the
obligation
to...
to
exhaust
the
state
rule
as
well
as
the
federal
rule?
because
that
was
a
remedy
for
the
basic
wrong
you're
complaining
of.
unknown
speaker
are
inadequate
assistance
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
same
as--
unknown
speaker
--ineffective
assistance
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
a
difference
in
names
or
a
difference
in
substance?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
you're
talking
about
appellate.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
okay.
if
you--
--mr.
balske,
could
you
cite
me
the...
the
portion
of
your
brief
in
opposition
that
you
think
most
clearly
presented--
unknown
speaker
--the...
the
issue
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
you
are
now
relying
on
at
the
supreme
court
level
to
wit
that
the
federal
constitution
was
cited
in
the
brief
to
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
where--
unknown
speaker
--this
is
the
brief
in
opposition--
--the
brief
in
opposition--
--to
certiorari.
--to
the
petition
for
cert.
unknown
speaker
once
i've
granted--
--it's
orange.
--on...
on
this
question,
it's
too
late
to
tell
me
the
question
is
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
like
to
know
it's
irrelevant
before
i
vote
to
grant
cert.
unknown
speaker
if...
can
you
tell...
tell
me,
if
i
were
to
accept
your
position
about
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
how
does
it
differ
from
what
i
wrote
in
dissent
when
i
thought
that
we...
you...
you
shouldn't
have
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
if
you...
if
you
remember?
if
you
don't
remember,
that's
all
right.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what's
bothering
me
about
it
is
it
sounds
like
a
reasonable
position,
but
it
also
sounds
like
a
position
i
agreed
with
in
dissent,
which
means
it
isn't
the
law,
the
opposite
is
the
law.
unknown
speaker
if
there
had
been
an...
an
objection
preserved
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
whatever
else,
this
doesn't
tell
us
what
the
facts
were,
would
not
that
have
been
a...
a
ground
for
saying
you
didn't
exhaust?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
they...
they
have
abandoned
an
objection
one...
one
would
think
would
be
the
logical
first
one,
he
doesn't
have
any
facts,
out
the
door.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
to
ignore
that
too?
unknown
speaker
but
if
this...
if
this
court
is
going
to
give
any
guidance,
certainly
that
should
be
the...
the
first
one,
shouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
what
your
case
is
about--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
balske.
general
myers,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
general
myers,
do
you
have
any
response
to
the...
to
the
new
point
raised...
it
was
new
to
me
anyway...
that...
that
this
in
fact,
the
federal
claim
was
raised
in
the
petition?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
is
that?
i'd
really
like
to
know
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
see,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
if
you
prevail,
i
hope
you're
not
unhappy
with
what
you
get,
because
you're
going
to
have
petitions
in
which
there's
a
huge
laundry
list
of
cases.
we
have
to
then
qualify
that
by
saying
there
has
to
be
a
fair
and
concise
statement
of
the
legal
and
the
factual
basis
for
the
claim.
