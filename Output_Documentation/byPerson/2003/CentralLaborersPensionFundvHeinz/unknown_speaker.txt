unknown
speaker
in
the...
in
the
guidance
that
is
given,
does
the...
has
the
irs
actually
passed
on
particular
amendments?
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
do
it?
unknown
speaker
is
this
in
the
manual?
unknown
speaker
do
we...
do
we
have
any
indication
of
how
many
determination
letters
have
been
issued?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
to
document
that,
that
it's
been
for
decades?
i
mean,
the
manual
provisions
and
the
rest
of...
of
what
you're
describing
is
not...
not
published.
so
where
do
we
get
the
2
decades
from?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you...
does...
does
the
list
specifically
say
that
the
amendments
can...
can
relate...
can,
in
fact,
relate
to
or
in
law
relate
to
prior
accrued--
unknown
speaker
--so,
it
leaves
that
question
open.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
pretty
negative
inference,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
i...
i
think
it's
pretty
explicit
when
it
says
that
the
accrued
benefit
of
a
participant
under
a
plan
may
not
be
decreased
by
an
amendment
of
the
plan.
and
i
don't...
the
trouble
i'm
having
is
it
just
seems
to
me
utterly
unrealistic
to
say
that
his
accrued
benefit
has
not
been
decreased
when
he
used
to
be
able
to
work
as
a...
as
a
supervisor
and
continued
to
draw
from
the
plan.
now
he
cannot
work
as
a
supervisor.
how
can
you...
i
mean,
certainly
if
you
placed
a
dollar
value
on
his
right
to
receive
money
from
the
plan,
you
would...
you
would
put
a
higher
price
on...
on
the...
the
individual
who
has
the
right
to
work
as
a
supervisor
and
still
continue
to
draw
money
as
opposed
to
the
person
who
doesn't
have
that
right.
i
mean,
the...
the
language
just
seems
to
me
utterly
plain.
unknown
speaker
it's
the
dollar
amount
that
they're
entitled
to
which
is
the
benefit.
unknown
speaker
but
that
means
you
can
say,
well,
you
know,
they're
still
entitled
to
that
dollar
amount,
but
they
can
only
get
it
every
other
year.
unknown
speaker
would
that
limitation
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
you
that
vests.
it's
the
pension
that
vests,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
just
questioning
your
choice
of
words.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
concede
that
with
respect
to
the...
the
decreases
that
were
a
term
of
the
plan
when
it
accrued
to
them.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
concede
anything
more,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
no
concession.
unknown
speaker
no.
that
wasn't
my
point
at
all.
my...
my
point,
which
i
took
a
long
time
to
make,
was
that
the
value
of
your
right
to
money,
even
though
you
work
as
a
supervisor,
is
greater
than
your
right
to
money
which
terminates
as
soon
as
you
begin
to
work
as
a
supervisor.
it's
a
less
valuable
benefit.
unknown
speaker
and
that
comes
right
within
the
language.
the
accrued
benefit
may
not
be
decreased
by
an
amendment.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that...
that
speaks
to
the
future
effect
of
such
an
amendment,
and
it...
when
you're
talking
about
getting
vesting,
you
can't
have
a
retroactive...
you
would
not
already
be
vested.
does
that
mean
that
if
somebody
vested
after
2
years,
they
could
then
adopt
an
amendment
saying
henceforth
it's
got
to
be
5
years
and
that
applies
to
somebody
who
is
already
vested?
unknown
speaker
does
it
really.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
they...
they
wouldn't
need
that
provision
if
the
principle
of
law
that
you're
urging
upon
us
existed.
i
mean,
the...
the
whole
reason,
it
seems
to
me,
that
they
had
to
make
that
clear
in
a
statutory
provision
is
that
without
it,
you
would
obviously
be
decreasing
the
value
of
the
plan
and
violating
the
provision
of
whatever
it
is,
1054(g)(1).
unknown
speaker
which...
which
part
of
1053?
unknown
speaker
okay.
read
them
please.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
that
argument
again,
mr.
goldstein.
this
says
you,
in
effect,
can
retroactively
require
a
longer
vesting
period.
that
would
mean
require
a
longer
period
before
you
acquired
an
accrued
benefit.
unknown
speaker
that
was
20...
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
accrued...
the
term,
accrued
benefits,
applies
to
benefits
that
have
not
yet
vested.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
that...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that,
but
anyway,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
vesting
means--
--you're
going
pretty
fast
for
me.
unknown
speaker
could
i
just
make
sure
i
understand
one
thing?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
a
delay
in
the
period
between
the
time
a
benefit
accrues
and
when
it
vests
is
not
covered
by
204(g),
but
a
reduction
of
a
benefit
that
has
already
both
accrued
and
vested
is...
is
not
covered
by
it
or
is...
you're
saying
they're
the
same.
that's
what
you're
saying--
unknown
speaker
--for
purposes
of--
--answer
the
question.
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that
as
set
forth
in...
in
your
brief
and...
and
you
made
it
sound
like
a
very
significant,
very
important
power,
but
also
you
made
it,
to
me,
sound
like
it...
it
gives
almost
no
effect
at
all
to
the
anti-cutback
provisions.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
this...
this
is
a
sweeping
authority
you're
arguing
for
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff.
oh,
the
economy
is
this
way
and
that
way.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
goldstein.
mr.
elwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
could
you
address
one...
one
question
i
have?
the
fact
that
the...
the
plan
doesn't...
or
the
contributors
don't
lose
their
tax
deduction
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
those...
that
they
otherwise
comply
with
erisa.
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever
said
that?
unknown
speaker
the
treasury
department,
of
course,
is
interpreting...
is
interpreting
the
statute
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether...
the
income
tax
consequences
of
contributions
basically.
unknown
speaker
the
thing
that
runs
through
my
mind
is
i'm
not
sure
they
have
the
same
expertise,
for
example,
as
if
the
department
of
labor
had
to
give
them
the
same...
same
answer
to
this
question.
unknown
speaker
but
the
concern
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
ability
of
people
to
move
in
and
out
of
the...
out
of
the
trade,
which
is
specifically
a
labor
department
interest.
the
labor
department
would
be
more
interested
in
ensuring
that...
that
interest
is
preserved
than
the
treasury
department
would.
unknown
speaker
and
the...
the
labor
department
has
not
adopted
a
position
on
this
question--
unknown
speaker
--now,
may
i
ask
you
about
section
203?
because
the
respondent
says
it
governs
only
normal
retirement
benefits
and
not
early
retirement
benefits
that
are
at
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
to...
to
comment
on
an
argument
that
mr.
goldstein
just
made?
his...
his
argument
was
that,
at
least
certainly
so
far
as
the
construction
industry
is
concerned,
unless
this
kind
of
retroactive
effect
could
be
given,
there...
the...
the
various
plans
could
not
protect
themselves,
or
at
least
they...
they
could
not
take
account
of...
of
labor
market
conditions.
it
would
be
useless
to.
my
question
is
assume
that
is
so.
erisa
is
made
for
all
sorts
of
plans.
it
isn't
just
made
for
the
construction
industry.
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
construction
industry's
labor
market
problems
in...
in
fixing
the...
the
statue
in
the
way
mr.
goldstein
and
you
say
it
has
been
arranged?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we...
how
do
we
know
that?
in
other
words,
how
do
we
know
that
this
argument
is
not
the
tail
wagging
the
dog?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
don't...
we
don't
have
to
adopt
your
provision
to...
to
accord
that
flexibility.
all
that's
needed
is
that
the
plan
state,
when
it
is
established,
that
these
provisions
dealing
with
where
you
can
work
are
amendable.
once
it
says
that,
then
there's
no
reduction
in
the
value
of...
of
the
benefits
that
the
employee
receives.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
just
very
clear
from
the
outset
that
these
things
are
subject
to
defeasance.
all
we're
talking
about
is
a
plan
that
doesn't
contain
that
provision
at
the
outset,
and
then
later
decides
it
wants
to
change
its
mind.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that--
--okay.
you're
referring
to
j.a.
50.
give
us
a
minute,
if
you're--
unknown
speaker
--if
you're
interested
in
our
comprehending
what
you're
saying.
give
us
a
minute
to
turn
to
that
page,
will
you?
where
on
page
50
is
it?
unknown
speaker
whereabouts
are
you
reading?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
amendments.
it
just
says
if
you
had
a
suspension,
you
got...
you
got
to
give
notice.
i
don't...
i
don't
see
that.
presumably
that...
that's
a
suspension
provided
for
in
the
plan
but
the
plan--
unknown
speaker
--what...
what
would
happen
if
there
were
a...
a
suspension
if
you
were
working
in
any
other
industry?
suppose
the
plan
adopted
that?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is...
what
is
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
is...
which...
on
which
you
rest
to
make
that
distinction--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
whether
it's
very
important
for
the
construction
industry?
suppose
some
plan
said
it's
for
any
industry.
unknown
speaker
if
this
is
so
central
to
your
case,
how
come
it
only
shows
up
in
your...
in
the
reply
brief?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--you...
you've
been
dying
to
respond
to
something
i
raised.
let
me
give
you
the
chance
to
do
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
elwood,
you--
--thank
you,
mr.
elwood.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gossett,
it's
your
turn.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
i...
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
the...
there's...
there's
another
reliance
problem
here
and...
and
that,
i
take
it,
is
the...
is
the
reliance
upon
a
contrary
view
taken
by
the
irs.
and
the...
the...
your...
your
colleagues
on
the
other
side
say
that
if
we
see
it
your
way,
there's
an
enormous
number
of
plans
out
there
who
are
suddenly
going
to
find
themselves
unqualified
or
disqualified,
whatever
the
term
is.
is...
is
there
a
way
to
avoid
that
if...
if
you
are
correct
on
the
law,
but
they
are
correct
about
the...
the
practice?
unknown
speaker
what
part
are
we...
how
does
that--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
i
don't
think
they
could
because
you
have
an
answer
there
to
question
6
which
says
that
if
you
put
in
your
original
plan
a
provision
that
would
say
the
employer
can
change
the
definition
of
who's
working
in
his
same
company
over
time,
as
labor
circumstances
call
for
it,
that
that
gives
the
employer
discretion,
and
you
can't
do
it
because
giving
them
that
discretion
would
itself
count
as
a
reduction.
now,
that's
well
established.
the
whole
point
of
this...
so
you
tell
me
how
they
could
write
a
plan
to
do
what
you
think
they
should
be
able
to
do.
and
of
course,
they
should.
that's
the
whole
point
of
this
part
of
203.
unknown
speaker
the
whole
point
of
203,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
it
was
something
put
in
there
by
the
teamsters
or
possibly
the
crafts
unions
so
that
when
you
get
your...
your
early
retirement
benefit
and
you're
out
there,
don't
come
back
to
my
plant.
why
not
my
plant?
because
when
you
do,
you
will
work
for
a
low
wage
and
that
will
depress
the
wages
of
other
workers.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
say
absolutely
never.
i'm
not
going
to
say
always.
it's
going
to
depend
on
labor
conditions,
and
that's
why
if
that
purpose
is
not
what
that
part
of
203
is
there
for,
you
can
explain
why
it
is
there.
but
if
i'm
right
about
why
it's
there,
your
interpretation
not
only
disrupts
20
years
of...
of
how
this
has
been
administered,
but
also
makes
it
unworkable.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
there?
unknown
speaker
put
a
little
footnote
here
that
i
may
not
agree
with
your
statement,
but
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
that...
that
would
be
an
odd
purpose.
now,
wait,
you're
saying
that
the
purpose
of
this...
i
have
a...
a
plant
where
i
make
trousers
and
some
of
my
workers
have
retired
early.
and
you're
saying
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
make
sure
that
my
worker
who's
retired
early
doesn't
go
work
for
justice
ginsburg's
plant,
the
trousers,
some
other
plant.
all
right?
now,
that
would
be
very
odd
to
have
that
purpose
served
by
the
language
which
i
think
says
by...
that...
that
in
the
case
of
a
plan
other
than
by
an
employer
who
maintains
the
plan...
that
is,
it's
talking
about
going
back
to
the
same
plant,
isn't
it?
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
they're...
they're
talking
about
going
back
to
my
plant,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's...
am
i
right
about
that?
it's
talking
about
going
back
to
my
plant,
not
justice
ginsburg's
plant.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that--
unknown
speaker
--if
i've
retired
early
and
i'm
an
expert
trouser
maker,
i
could
go
back
to
work
for
justice
ginsburg's
plant
and
nobody
would
care
as
far
as
this
provision
is
concerned.
right?
unknown
speaker
yes.
it's
my...
my--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
unknown
speaker
the
reason
is
supposedly...
what
they
say
is
the
reason
we
want
to
change
the
rules
is
because
labor
conditions
change
and
whereas
in
this
year
where
the
plant...
where
the
economy
is
booming,
i
don't
really
have
a
problem,
at
least
my
workers
don't,
with
retirees
coming
back
and
depressing
their
wages.
well,
it
wouldn't
be
changing
the
rules,
would
it,
if
you
said
at
the
beginning
these
rules
can
be
changed?
isn't
that
all
your
saying,
that...
that
the
employer
can
do
it
so
long
as
when
the
plan
is
established,
it
is
made
clear
that
the
rules
can
be
changed?
unknown
speaker
then...
then
you're
not
changing
the
rules
when
you
change
the
rules,
so
to
speak.
i...
i
thought
your
brief
was...
was
candid,
mr.
gossett,
and
you
said
you
couldn't...
you
could
not
do
what
justice
scalia
just
suggested.
you
couldn't
say
up
front
in
the
plan,
we
can
amend
it
anytime
back
and
forth
the
way
we
like.
i
thought
you
said
quite
clearly
in
your
brief
that
that
wouldn't
work.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only--
unknown
speaker
--i
want
to
get
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
before
you
lose
that.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
thought
that
what
he
was
suggesting
was
not
possible
because
of
the
reason
of
the
answer
to
question
6.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
want
to
know
first
if
i'm
right
or
wrong.
unknown
speaker
i
am
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if...
if
your
hypothesis
is
that
even
when
it
says
they're
promised
nothing,
in
other
words,
that
they...
it
can
be
changed
retroactively...
you're...
you're
saying
that
that
is
a
promise
that's
not
kept?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
complain.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
203
that...
that
provided
that
guarantee.
i
thought
it
was
203
that
prevents
you
from
going
too
far
in
what
you
say
you
can
change.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
204
does
it.
unknown
speaker
my...
my
true
question...
it
isn't...
it
isn't...
i
think
there's
no
easy
answer
to
this
case.
all
right?
and
i
agree
with
you
that
in
ordinary
english,
we'd
call
this
a
reduction.
but
there
is
in
203(g)...
or,
you
know,
the
203
part
we're
talking
about...
there
is
an
obvious
purpose
to
do
something
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
normal
erisa
purposes.
it's
right
there
and
it's
done
for
labor
reasons.
and
you
can
interpret
it
either
way.
so
given
the
either-way
possibility,
in
my
own
mind
this
is
where
i
am.
i'm
telling
you
truthfully.
i'd
say--
unknown
speaker
--either-way
possibility.
well,
they've
had
this
for
20
years.
they
have
regs
that
are
consistent
with
it.
people
have
lived
with
it.
go
with
the
administration.
i
mean,
that's...
all
right?
so
that's...
that's
where
i...
that's
what
i...
that's
how
i'm
thinking
about
it,
and
i'd
like
to
hear
your
response
to
that.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not...
if
your...
if
your
position
prevails,
then
i
take
it
the
only
way
an
employer
can
protect
himself
against
hard
times
is
to
say
for
this
class
of
early
retirees,
no
employment.
any
employment
will
result
in
suspension
of
benefits,
and
to
say
for
the
ones...
normal
retirees
are
the
ones
who
are
restricted
only
with
respect
to
the
same
trade,
to
make
the
rule
as
restrictive
as
possible.
i
think
that
your...
your
interpretation
forces
the
employer
who
wants
to
protect
against
hard
times
to
take
that
view.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
you're...
you're
back
to
the
word
reduction
where
i
agree
with
you.
but
i
would
have
thought
that
this...
this
provision
here
in
203
really
reflects
a
tension
within
the
union.
the
union
wants
to
get
benefits
for
its
early
retirees,
and
that
argues
for
going
back.
but
the
union
also
wants
to
reflect...
or
protect
the
wages
of
the
people
who
are
already
there.
and
that
means
that
if
there
is
a
recession,
what
we
want
to
do
is
stop
too
many
people
from
going
back
because
that
might
have
a
depressing
effect
on
the
workers
who
are
there.
now,
i
put
that
again
because
that...
that
was
how
i
began
to
understand
what
was
going
on
in
this
provision
and
i
want
you
to
be
able
to
say,
no,
you're
wrong.
that
isn't
what's
going
on.
unknown
speaker
it's
certainly
designed
to
protect
plans
in
some
respects,
the
preemption,
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
about
this,
that...
that
the...
that
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
there
for
the...
for
the
protection
of
the
plans?
i
forget
what
it
is,
but
isn't
there
a
provision
that
if
the
plan
gets
in
financial
straits,
then
in
fact
there...
there
can...
can
be
an
amendment
that
might
otherwise
might
be
allowed,
an
amendment
that
would...
would
save
the
plan
money?
is
that
correct?
or
save
the
employer
money
so
he
can
continue
to
contribute
to
the
plan.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would...
that
would--
unknown
speaker
--be...
that
would
be
a
redundancy
on...
on
the
argument
that
your...
your
colleagues
on
the
other
side
make
then
i
take
it.
on
their
position,
that
wouldn't
be
necessary.
unknown
speaker
yes.
mr.
gossett,
would
you
just
make
sure
i
understand
one
thing
correctly?
it's
been
asked
two
or
three
times,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i'm
right
on
it.
the
amendment
that...
the
plan
provision
that
justice
scalia
hypothesized
which
authorized
this
sort
of
change...
you
agree
that
if
you
prevail,
that
kind
of
plan
provision
would
be
impermissible.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
it's
still
is
the
same...
it
doesn't
affect
your
argument,
so
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
about
that.
unknown
speaker
because
of
what?
just
tell
me
the
provision
that
you
think
precludes
it.
unknown
speaker
i
want
the
statutory
provision.
i
want
the
statutory
provision
that
makes
that
no
good.
204(g).
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
what
we
were
discussing
before
and
you
spell
this
out
in
your
brief,
and
you
were
very
candid
in
saying
justice
scalia's
solution
wouldn't
work.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
they...
that
the...
(c)
being
there
shows
no
more
than,
that
the
words,
shall
provide,
which
is
the
beginning
of
203,
do
not
mean
shall
provide
in
the
original
plan.
they
must
mean
shall
provide
in
the
original
plan
or
through
permissible
amendments
because
if
they
meant
the
original
plan
only,
there
would
be
no
safety.
unknown
speaker
it
says
at
the
very
beginning,
(a),
each
pension
plan
shall
provide
that.
and
as
some
of...
reading
some
of
what
you've
written,
it's
as
if
you
think
those
words
mean
in
the
original
plan,
and...
and
i
think
they
point
to
(c)
to
say
it
can't
mean
that.
unknown
speaker
we're
back
to
the
circle.
i
mean,
the...
you're
quite
right.
every
time
it
talks
about
the
amendments
or
otherwise,
it
uses
some
word
like
you
can't
reduce,
and
the
ordinary...
it
would
have
been
simpler
if
they
had
amended
that
word
reduced,
wherever
it
appears,
with
the
same
exception
they
have
here
in
203.
then
you'd
lose
definitely
and
you'd
admit
it.
on
the
other
hand,
they
didn't
put
those
words
in
and
that
gives
the
strength
to
your
argument.
but
on
the
other
hand,
they
say,
well,
yes,
that
if
in
fact
they
didn't
mean
to
read
it
in,
they're
really
going
to
reduce
the
effectiveness
of
that
same
kind
of
thing
over
in
203,
you
see,
because
they
just
have
it
for
the
forfeitability.
they
don't
have
it
for
the
reduction.
really,
please,
that
doesn't
make
much
sense.
so
that's
why,
you
know,
i
can't
get
a
firm
answer
out
of
the
language.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
acknowledge
that
plans
have
been
making
these
changes
and
the
irs
has
been
accepting
them
for
purposes
of
the
employer's
tax
deductions.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
section
203
refers
to
normal
retirement
plans.
you
take
the
position
that
it
doesn't
cover
early
retirement.
unknown
speaker
was
that
distinction
made
in
the
seventh
circuit
between
the
early
retirement
benefits
with
regard
to
the
application
of
203(a)?
unknown
speaker
was
that...
was
that
an
argument
that
you
presented
to
the
seventh
circuit
distinguishing
the
early
retirements
benefits
from
normal
retirement
benefits
for
203(a)
purposes?
i
thought
it
was...
that
it
was
acknowledged
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
203(a)
applied
to
the
early
retirement
benefits
as
well
as
the
normal...
normal
retirement
benefits.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
say
that
204(g)
prevents
the
plan
at
the
outset
from
rendering
itself
amendable,
but
if
you
agreed
with
them
that
204(g)
does
not
prevent
the
later
amendment,
it
would
also
be
true
that
204(g)
does
not
prevent
the
employer
from
the
outset
at
saying
that
the
retirement
benefits
are
amendable.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
was
making
the
point
earlier
that
even
if
we
find
for
you,
the
employer
would...
would
have
a
way
of...
of
solving
the
problem,
which
is
simply
at
the
outset
to
set
forth.
now,
it's
very
difficult
for
them
to
respond
to
that
argument
when
they
say
that
204(g)
does
not
stop...
does...
does
not
prevent
a
later
change
in
the
plan.
how
could
it
possibly
prevent
a
later
change
but...
not
prevent
a
later
change,
but
prevent
a
change
at
the
outset
and
announce
that
you're
going
to
make
a
change?
unknown
speaker
but
another
way
of
putting
justice
scalia's
point
is
if
they're
right,
it's
surprising
that
they
didn't
make
the
point
clearer
in
their
plans
because
it
would
have
been
legal
to
do
so.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean
if
their
basic
theory
of
the
204(g)
is
correct,
then
all
the
plans
could
have
solved
this
problem
by
saying
so
expressly
so
nobody
would
have
been
fooled
as
your
clients
were.
they
could
have
said
in
the
plan
itself,
we
retain
the
right
to
do
this.
they
say
it's
just
there
by
statute,
but
the
plan
is
somewhat
ambiguous,
and
they
could
have
said
so
expressly
if
they're
right
and
you're
wrong.
unknown
speaker
they
couldn't
have
done
it
if
you're
right
and
they're
wrong.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr....
thank
you,
mr.
gossett.
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
your
plan
could
have
made
clear
what
you
say
the
law
otherwise
authorizes.
