justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
sates
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
employee
retirement
security
act
known
as
erisa
was
intended
to
protect
employees’
justified
expectations
of
receiving
the
benefits
their
employers
promise
them.
to
that
end,
erisa’s
anti-cutback
rule
prohibits
any
amendment
of
an
employee
pension
plan
that
would
reduce
a
plan
participant’s
accrued
pension
benefits.
respondents
heinz
and
schmitt
are
retired
construction
workers
covered
by
a
multi
employer
pension
plan
that
is
administered
by
the
petitioner,
central
laborers'
pension
fund.
when
heinz
and
schmitt
retired,
the
terms
of
their
pension
plan
allowed
them
to
receive
pension
benefits
and
still
take
post-employment
work
as
construction
supervisors,
as
they
did.
in
1998
however,
the
plan
was
amended
to
prohibit
supervisory
work
and
heinz
and
schmitt’s
pension
benefits
were
suspended
when
they
refused
to
quit
their
jobs.
the
question
is
whether
erisa’s
anti-cutback
rule
prohibits
applying
the
1998
plan
amendments
to
heinz
and
schmitt.
we
must
decide,
in
other
words,
whether
the
plan
reduced
already
accrued
benefits
when
it
expanded
the
categories
of
post-retirement
employment
that
triggers
suspension
of
those
benefits.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
amendment
did
reduce
accrued
benefits
and
accordingly
we
affirm
the
seventh
circuit.
as
a
matter
of
commonsense,
a
participant’s
benefits
cannot
be
understood
without
reference
to
the
conditions
imposed
on
receiving
those
benefits.
an
amendment
placing
materially
greater
restrictions
on
the
receipt
of
the
benefits
therefore
reduces
the
benefit
just
as
surely
as
a
decrease
in
the
size
of
the
monthly
pension
benefits.
heinz
and
schmitt
worked
in
accrued
pension
benefits
under
a
plan
with
terms
allowing
them
to
supplement
retirement
income
by
working
as
construction
supervisors
and
they
were
being
reasonable
if
they
relied
on
those
terms
in
planning
their
retirement.
the
1998
amendment
undercut
any
such
reliance
paying
retirement
income
only
if
the
respondents
accepted
a
substantial
curtailment
of
their
opportunity
to
do
the
kind
of
work
they
knew.
we
simply
do
not
see
how,
in
any
practical
sense,
this
change
of
terms
could
not
be
viewed
as
shrinking
the
value
of
the
respondents’
pension
rights
and
reducing
the
benefits
that
they
had
already
earned.
our
reading
is
confirmed
by
an
internal
revenue
service
regulation
that
it
adopts
justice
reading
of
erisa’s
anti-cutback
rule.
the
regulation
allows
employers
to
modify
the
pension
packages
they
are
offering
to
their
employees
so
long
as
any
changes
applies
solely
to
the
portion
of
an
employee’s
retirement
benefits
earned
his
compensation
for
future
employment.
the
irs
regulations
treats
such
a
plan
modification
very
differently
however
when
an
employer
attempts
to
add
new
conditions
to
the
receipt
of
benefits
already
accrued.
the
rule
in
that
case
is
categorical,
“the
addition
of
objective
conditions
with
respect
to
a
pension
benefit
that
is
already
accrued
violates
the
anti-cutback
rule.”
so
far
as
the
irs
regulations
are
concerned,
the
any
anti-cutback
provision
flatly
prohibits
plans
from
attaching
new
conditions
to
benefits
that
an
employee
has
already
earned.
the
fact
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
taken
different
positions
and
less
formal
settings
is
not
relevant
here.
speaking
in
its
authoritative
voice,
the
irs
has
long
since
approved
the
interpretation
of
the
ani-cutback
rule
that
we
adopt
today.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
o’connor
and
ginsburg
joined.
