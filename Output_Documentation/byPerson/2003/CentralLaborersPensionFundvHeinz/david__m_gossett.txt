mr.
david
m.
gossett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
laborers'
pension
fund
promised
tom
heinz
and
rick
schmitt
that
after
they
accepted
an
early
retirement
package,
they
would
be
entitled
to
work
in
specific
jobs
without
sacrificing
their
pension
plans.
it
is
a
foundational
principle
of
erisa
that
participants
are
entitled
to
rely
on
plan
promises
such
as
this
one.
by
reneging
on
this
promise
and
changing
the
rules
after
the
fact,
the
plan
violated
section
204(g)
of
erisa
and
decreased
the
value
of
participants'
plan,
as
justice
scalia--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
under
internal
revenue
code
section
7805(b),
the
irs
has
the
right
to
say
that
any
amendment
before
the
date
of
this...
of
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
wouldn't
lead
to
a
disqualification
of...
of
the
plan.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
no,
justice
breyer.
the...
the
part...
the...
the
point
of
203
is
not
to
allow
plans
to
change
the
rules
over
time--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--that's
not
why
it's
there,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
section...
section
203(a)(3)(b),
for
starters,
only
applies
to
normal
retirement
benefits.
under
section
203(a)
of
erisa,
normal
retirement
benefits
are...
cannot
be
forfeited.
but
for
section
203(a)(3)(b),
there
would
be
no
situation
in
which
a
plan
could
suspend
benefit
payments.
so
203(a)(3)(b)
specifies...
it
delimits
the
limited
circumstances
in
which--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--okay.
i...
footnote
noted.
but
the
point
of
203(a)(3)(b)
is
to
say
that
you
can
only
limit
plans...
suspensions
in
two
certain
circumstances.
the...
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
203(a)(3)(b),
though,
it
discusses
how...
how
employers
shouldn't
be
required
to
subsidize
competitors.
they
shouldn't
be
required
to...
union
employers
should
not
have
former
union
workers
going
in
for
work
for
non-union
competitors
at
lower
wages
because
they're
also
receiving
a
pension
benefit.
that's
what's
rife
throughout
the
legislative
of
erisa.
but
there's
nothing
in
that...
that
purpose
which
requires
a
plan
to
be
able
to
change
the
rules,
which
is
what
they
want.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
well,
in...
there...
there
are--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--in
the
context
of
a
single
employer
plan,
which
is--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--sorry.
in
the
single
employer
plan,
it
only
limit...
it's
only
to
prevent
double...
true
double
dipping.
what
double
dipping
is,
is
where
you
accrued
benefits
while
also
receiving
benefits
from
the
same
plan.
it's...
it's--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--that's
all
you
can--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--if
your
pension
fund
was
a
single--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--employer
pension
fund.
it
was
not
a
multiemployer.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
but
in
the
multiemployer
context,
it's...
it's
only
about
cross-subsidization.
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
in
either
of
those
cases,
there's
no
reason
why
the
pension
fund...
why
the...
the
fund
should
be
allowed
to
change
the
rules.
the...
those--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--not
exactly.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i...
i
agree
completely.
the...
the
point
is
that
there's
no
difference
between
a
plan
provision
that
says
we
can
change
the
suspension
rules
at
any
point
and
reduce
them
versus
a
plan
provision
that
says
we
can
reduce
your
benefit
from
$1,600
a
month
to
$1,400
a
month
at
any
point
if
we
so
choose.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
both
of
those
would...
sorry.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
this
is--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--the
answer
to
question
6
in
the...
in
the
regulations
is
a
subsidiary
answer.
i
think
it's
by
far
the
less
important
answer.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
yes.
that
is
an
answer
is
that
it
cannot
be--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--discretionary
on
the...
to
the
plan
to
cut
back...
to
do
something
because
of
plan
funding.
but
the
more
fundamental
answer
is
that
if
that
were
the
case,
every
plan
could
include
a
provision
that
said
in
just
these
words,
any
benefit
that
we've
promised
you
in
this
plan
can
be
reduced
at
a
future
date
at
our
discretion.
and
if
a
plan
could
say
that
and
still
be
valid
under
erisa,
the
anti-cutback
rule
would
be
meaningless.
every
plan
would...
could
say
that.
so
erisa
was
passed
specifically
because
historically
plans
were
pulling
back
benefits,
relying
on
the
common
law
rule
that
a
pension
is
simply
a
gratuity.
and
the
anti-cutback
rule
is
the
primary
provision
in
erisa
that
was
designed
to
say,
no,
when
a...
a
participant
is
promised
something,
that
promise
has
to
be
kept.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
that
is
a
promise
that
is
kept
on
the
most
technical
level,
of
course.
if
i'm
promised
nothing
and
i'm
given
nothing,
i...
i--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--one
simply
can't
complain.
but
the...
the
whole
goal
of
erisa
is
to
require
employers
to
say
we're
going
to...
to
say
we're
going
to
give
you
this
and...
and
keep
their...
their
word
to
that.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
it
is
both
203
and
204,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
the...
the...
mr.
goldstein
tries
to
differentiate
203
and
204
and
argue
that
they're
completely
distinct
beasts,
the
one
not
affecting
the
other.
that's
simply
not
the
case.
as
the
irs
has
said
in
its
regulations,
anything
that
indirectly
decreases
a
benefit
is
equally
violative
of
204(g).
and
it's
easy
to
come
up
with...
with
plan
provisions
that,
quote,
forfeit
a
benefit
rather
than
decrease
the
benefit,
but
which
obviously
reduced
the
value
you
get.
i
mean,
the
most
obvious
example
would
be
a...
an
amendment
that
says,
each
month
we're
going
to
flip
a
coin
and
decide
whether
or
not
you
get
a
check
this
month.
that
benefit
would
be--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--thank
you.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
okay.
i
have
several
responses
to
that
because
it's
obviously
a
critical
point.
the...
the
first
response
is
that
although
the
irs
and
mr.
goldstein
have
told
us
that
this
is
a
longstanding
government
position,
the
only
thing
they
can
actually
point
to
that
states
that
position
is
the
internal
revenue
manual
that
dates
to
2001.
the
list
of
required
modifications,
the
lrm,
not
the
irm,
which
does
go
back
quite
some
time
earlier,
specifically
says
that
it
is
designed
to
aid
people
in
drafting
or
redrafting
plans
and
that
the
provisions
included
therein
could
be
useful
in
some
plans,
it
could
be
violative
in
other
plans.
so
that's
not
authority
by
which
someone
can
actually
look
at
an
irs
publication
and
say,
this
is
what
we
have...
the
irs
allows.
they
say
that
they've
issued
letters...
determinations
that
they
have
allowed
these
in
the
past,
but
those
are
not
due
deference
under...
certainly
not
under
chevron,
probably
not
even
under
skidmore.
those
are
sort
of
individual
case
determinations
and
they
have
put
none
of
these
in
the
record.
and
in
any
event,
under
section...
code
section
7805,
the
irs
says
that
those
can
be
wrong,
and
if
they're
wrong,
all
it
means
is
the
plan
can't
be
disqualified
for
having
done
something
wrong.
there's...
there
are
no
tax
implications.
the
plan
can
still
owe
damages
to
someone
who
in
fact
was
hurt
by
the
amendment,
but
that
is
itself
a
small
cost
in
this
case.
mr.
goldstein
is
engaged...
and
more
to
the
point,
his
amici
is
engaging
in
hyperbole
by
saying
this
is
going
to
bankrupt
plans.
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
80,
the
plan...
the
plan's
actuary
tells
us
that
exactly
seven
people's
benefits
were
cut
off
as
a
result...
suspended
as
a
result
of
this
amendment.
that's
out
of
5,300
active
pensioners,
according
to
the
plan's
web
site
at
the
moment.
we're
talking
less
than
two-tenths
of
1
percent
of
people
were,
in
fact,
cut...
suspended
because
of--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--i...
i
disagree,
justice
ginsburg.
the...
from
the...
the
employer's
setting
up
a
plan,
the
essentials
of
a
plan,
all
they
care
about
is
how
much
money
a
plan
is
going
to
cost
them.
and
it's
a...
it's
a
design
decision
whether
or
not
you'd
rather
have
a
benefit
of,
say,
$2,000
a
month
with
a
narrow...
a
narrower
suspension
rule
or
$1,990
a
month
with
a
wider
suspension
rule.
both
of
those
plans
cost
the
employer
the
same
amount
of
money.
there's
no...
the...
the
details
of
the
number,
of
course,
are...
are
questions
for
actuaries.
but
the...
the
design
question
is
one
that
can
be
made
completely
independent
of
this.
is
it's
how
important
is
it
to
the
employer
whether
people
go
back
to
work
in
other
jobs,
how
important
is
it
to
the
employees
that
they
can
work
in
specific
jobs.
the...
while
a
change
in
the
plan
might
save
the...
the
plan
money,
the
initial
design
decision
about
how
restrictive
the
rules
should
be
isn't
a
financial
question
in
the...
in
the
slightest.
and
in
fact,
the
fact
that
the
change
in
the
plan...
the...
in
the
suspension
rule,
the
amendment
here
saved
the
plan
money,
is
in
fact
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
all
that
the
amendment
violates
the
anti-cutback
rule.
the
anti-cutback
rule
prevents,
quote,
a
decrease--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--what's
going
on
is
that...
justice
breyer,
is
that
plans...
that...
that
unions
and
the
employers
want
to
prevent
cross-subsidization.
but
there's...
while
it
is
certainly
the
case
that,
at
least
according
to
this
plan
and
its
amici,
they
have
started
to
rely
on
this
purported
right
to
deal
with
changing
market
conditions,
they
have
no
authority
for
doing
so.
the
only
thing
they
can
point
to
is
one
floor
statement
by
representative
dent
after
that
provision
of
erisa,
in
fact,
had
been
enacted,
saying
that
there
might
be
some
change
in
market
conditions
which
would
affect
things.
employers
can
deal
with
changing
market
conditions
in
the
traditional
ways.
they
can
pay
more
or
less
money.
and
in
any
event,
the
thing
missing
in
that
approach
to
203
is
the
foundational
principle
that
erisa
is
designed
to
protect
participants.
it's
not
designed
to
protect
plans.
it's
designed
to
protect
the
participants
in
the
plans.
that's
why
it...
that's
why
the
vesting
and
accrual
rules
are
very
explicit.
and
in
fact,
turning
very
briefly
to
the
vesting
rules,
mr.--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--yes,
that's
true,
but
that's
largely
an
indirect
way
of
protecting
the
plan...
the
plans
and
more
indirectly
the...
the
participants
and
more
indirectly
the
participants
and
more
indirectly
the
federal
fisc
because,
of
course,
plans
are...
are
insured
by
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
board.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
with
the...
yes,
justice
souter.
with
the...
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary
of
labor,
with
the
disclosure--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
consent,
you
can
pass
an
amendment
in
a
plan
that--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--reduces
benefits.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
yes.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
reach
the
question
because
the
plan
in
this
case
doesn't,
in
fact,
include
that
provision.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
but
i
think
that
that
plan
provision
would
not
be
permissible.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
yes,
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
i...
i
want
to--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--i
think
that
it
is
on
the
narrow...
on
the
narrow
end...
it's
a
technical
level...
it's
precluded
under
the
irs's
own
regulations
which
point
out
that
you
can't
have...
you
can't
change
conditions
in
a
way
that
violates
missions.
but...
but
on
the
more
fundamental
level,
it
violates--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--204(g).
mr.
david
m.
gossett
204(g)(1)
which
says
you
can't
decrease
benefits.
and
while
one
can
come
up
with
a
technical
reason...
reading
of
that
said
that
your
provision
would
not
violate
204(g)(1),
it
would
read
204(g)(1)...
204(g)
out
of
erisa
because--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i...
i
want...
i
wanted
to
turn
quickly
to...
to
203(c),
the...
the
amendment
provision
in
the
vesting
statute
that
mr.
goldstein
talked
about.
there
are
a
couple
of
things
to
note
about
that.
the
first
and
foremost
is
probably
that
it
shows
that
203(a)(1)(b),
the...
the
suspension
rule
that
we're
talking
about,
talks
about
a
plan
providing
for
something.
in
203(c),
they
talk
about
a
plan
amending
the
rules.
if
they
had
wanted
to
talk
about
an
amendment
in
203(a)(1)(b),
they
could
have.
they...
they
talked
about
terms
amending
things
elsewhere
in
the
same
provision.
but
more
fundamentally,
mr.
goldstein
is
simply
wrong
that
a
plan
can
retroactively
de-vest
a
participant
of
benefits
that
had
previously
vested.
under
203(c)(1)(a),
which
is
on
page
4a
of
the
yellow
brief,
it...
it
explains
that
a
plan
amendment
shall
not...
shall
be
treated
as
not
satisfying
203
if
the...
if
the
amended
amount
is
less
than
such
a
non-forfeitable
percentage
commuted...
computed
under
the
plan
without
regard
to
such
amendment.
so,
for
example,
if
a
plan
participant
had
earned
20
percent
of
their...
had
a
non-forfeitable
interest
in
20
percent
of
their
accrued
benefit
and
the
plan
switched
from
a
progression
to
a...
a
cliff
vesting,
where
you
got
everything
in
5
years,
they
could
do
that,
but
they
couldn't
remove
your
20
percent.
they
could
say
you
don't
vest
in
anything
more
until
the
5-year
period,
but
they
couldn't
say
you
lose
the
20
percent
vested
that
you
already
have.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
the
term
provide
is
not
in
203(a)(1)(a)
and
(b),
which
are
the--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--justice
breyer,
the
amendment
of
a
plan
is
authorized
under
erisa
section
402(b)(3).
402(b)(3)
is
the
provision
of
erisa
that
says
any
plan
must
include
a
provision
that
allows
amendments.
the
amendments
that
are
authorized
under
402(b)(3)
are
then
limited
by
the
anti-cutback
rule,
by
the
provisions
of...
of
203,
by
everything
else
in
erisa.
the...
these
specific
limitations
on
amendments,
though,
are
fully...
are
all
read
in
para
materia.
each...
each
limitation
on
amendments
applies
to
every
amendment
and
there's
no
provision
in
203
that
says
these
amendments
are
allowed.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
i
think
that
the
text
of
the
statute
is
pretty
clearly
on
my
side.
the
only
thing
that
mr.
goldstein
can
point
to
is
this
created
purpose
and
supposed
longstanding
practice
of
plans
to
be
allowed
to
change
rules
retroactively
in
light
of
changing
market
conditions.
but
though
the
plans
have
been
doing
that,
it's
the
text
of
the
statute
that
controls
and--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--i
know,
justice--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--i
know,
justice
o'connor,
that
they
did
so
in
this
case.
beyond
that,
all
we
have
are
statements
in
the
irs's
brief
and
in
the
national
coordinating
committee's
brief,
but
they're
not
actually--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--section
203(a)(3)(b)
doesn't
apply
to
the
subsidized
portion
of
early
retirement
benefits.
the...
the...
that's
obvious
because
it
is
an
exception
to
203(a)
which
says
that
your
normal
retirement
is
non-forfeitable.
and
the
government
has
taken
this
position
as
well.
this
is
not
something
that
we
created.
in
the
regulation...
this
is
in
29
c.f.r.
2530.203.
the
government
explains
that
a
plan
can
provide
that
early
retirement
benefits
are
suspended
for
any
reason...
for
any
reemployment
because
203(a)(3)(b)
is
defining
the
universe
of
possible
suspension
rules
for
normal
retirement
benefits,
but
it
doesn't...
doesn't
limit
the
universe
of
suspension
rules
for
early
retirement
benefits.
and
in
fact,
in
september...
on
the
same
amendment
that
applied
to
messrs.
heinz
and
schmitt,
that...
in
that
same
amendment,
the
plan
provided
that
for
benefits
accrued
after
september
30th,
1998,
but
only
sort
of
prospective
benefits,
not
retroactive
benefits,
any
post-retirement
reemployment
would
lead
to
those
benefits
being
suspended.
they...
and...
and
this
actually
follows
from
the...
again,
from
the
irs's
own
position.
in
the
internal
revenue
manual,
the
irs
says
you
can
have
a
provision
saying
that
any
work
is...
is
suspensive,
but
you
can
only
do
that
prospectively
because
applying
the...
such
a
changed
rule
retroactively
would
decrease
their
benefits.
but
to
the
extent
that
you
can
have
a
rule
that
says
any
work
is
suspensive,
that
means
that
203(a)(3)(b)
isn't...
just
isn't
applicable
here.
it's
not
what
determines
whether
or
not
someone...
the
rules
that
a
plan
can
have
for
early
retirement
benefits.
a
plan
can
have
a--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--sorry.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
203(a)
applies
to
early
retirement
benefits
to
the
extent
that
they
are
the
actuarial
equivalent,
the
net
present...
the
financial
equivalent
of
normal
retirement
benefits,
but
not
to
the
subsidized
portion
of...
of
them.
so...
so
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
we
did
say
that
in...
in
the
lower
court,
but
i'm
not
100
percent
sure,
justice
ginsburg.
the...
one
other
point
i
wanted
to...
to
go
over.
though
the
plan
argues
that
204(g)
doesn't
apply
to
this
change...
they
say
that
the
change
only
applies
to
a
reduction
in
the
value
of
a
life
annuity...
that's
not
the
statutory
term.
the...
the
statutory
definition
of
an
accrued
benefit,
which
is
in
erisa
section
323,
is
the
individual's
accrued
benefit
determined
under
the
plan.
it's
whatever
the
plan
promises
to
the
participant
that
is
protected
by
the
plan.
it's--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--justice
scalia,
it
allows
an...
you
can
make
an
amendment--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--well,
it
clearly
prevents
the
later
change,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here.
i
think
it
also
prevents
the
earlier
change
because
i
think
any
other
reading
of
the
anti-cutback
rule
reads
it
out
of
the
statute,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
address
that
question
in
this
case.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
i
don't
think...
they
didn't
make
this
argument
below,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
they
made
this
argument
that--
mr.
david
m.
gossett
--yes.
mr.
david
m.
gossett
that's
exactly
right,
justice
stevens.
but
of
course,
they
didn't.
the...
the
main
provision
on
amendments
in
the
plan,
which
is
the
provision
at
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix,
says
that
no
amendment
can
decrease
the
accrued
value.
they
elsewhere
in
the
plan
talk
about
notifying
participants
of
changes
to
the
plan
and
discussed
that
there
could
be
a
change,
but
that
change...
that
doesn't
say
that
there
can
be
a
retroactive
change.
there
could
have
been
a
prospective
change
that
loosened
the
rules.
there
could
also
have
been
a
prospective
change
that
applied
to
newly
accrued
benefits
because
by
the
terms
of
that
provision,
the--
