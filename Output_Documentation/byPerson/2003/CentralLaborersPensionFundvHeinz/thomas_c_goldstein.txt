mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
erisa
pension
case.
the
petitioner
is
a
multiemployer
pension
plan.
the
respondent
plaintiffs
are
two
plan
participants.
each
accrued
a
pension
and
took
early
retirement
at
age
39,
and
each
claimed
a
full
pension
in
the
form
of
a
life
annuity.
at
issue
in
the
case
is
a
plan
amendment.
it
authorizes
the
suspension
of
retirees'
benefit
payments
during
the
time
that
they
choose
to
go
back
to
work
as
construction
supervisors.
before
the
amendment,
suspension
was
triggered
only
by
work
as
a
construction
laborer.
the
change
gives
rise
to
an
important,
albeit
highly
technical,
question
about
the
relationship
between
two
provisions
of
erisa.
the
question
is:
may
such
an
amended
employment
suspension
provision
apply
to
previously
accrued
benefits?
the
plan
says
the
answer
is
yes;
the
participants
say
the
answer
is
no.
the
expert
agencies
charged
by
congress
with
administering
erisa
have
also
spoken
to
the
question.
they
say
that
erisa
does
authorize
such
an
amendment,
and
they
reached
that
conclusion
by
construing
the
two
erisa
provisions
in
para
materia.
countless
pension
plans
around
the
nation,
in
turn,
have
relied
on
the
agencies'
guidance
in
shaping
their
plan
amendments
for
decades,
and
that
is
the
principal
reason
that
the
case
is
so
important.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
has,
not
in
formal
guidance.
the
process
is
that
you
can--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--there...
there
are
a
couple
of
layers
of
it.
the
first
is
that
the
irs
publishes
guidance
ahead
of
time.
for
about
2
decades,
there
has
been
something
called
the
lrm,
the
list
of
required
modifications.
it's
quoted
in...
it's
quoted
in
the
government's
brief
in
particular.
and
that
said
to
plans,
if
you're
going
to
adopt
a
plan
or
revise
a
plan,
here's
what
you
can
do.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
then
there's
a
second.
the
second
step
is
that
more
recently
they
have
published
what's
known
as
to
irm,
the
internal
revenue
manual,
and
that's
guidance
for
irs
employees.
and
then
there's
a
third
level,
and
that
is
plans
can
submit
their
plan
provisions
and
amendments
to
the
irs
for
what
are
known
as
determination
letters
on
which
the
irs
signs
off.
and
so
all
three
of
those
exist.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
don't.
i
don't
think
that
the
irs
was
able
to
come
up
with
a
particular
number,
but
they
did
say
that
their
consistent
practice
for
decades
has
been
to
approve
this
particular--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
get
that
from,
i
guess,
two
sources.
the
first
is
that
there
is
the
document...
the...
the
series
of
documents
known
as
the
lrm,
the
list
of
required
modifications,
that
has
guided
the
plans
for
a
couple
of
decades,
and
it
does
not
restrain
plans
in
its...
it
specifically
addresses
revisions
to
plans,
amendments,
and
it
doesn't
say
that
you
can
only
apply
it
a
suspension
provision
to
benefit
payments
that
accrue
in
the
future.
beyond
that,
when
it
comes
to,
you
know,
what
the
irs
does
day
in
and
day
out,
we
just
have
their
representation.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
it
doesn't.
there--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it...
it...
literally
in
its
text
it
does,
but
as
a
practical
matter
it
doesn't
because,
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
ginsburg,
the
lrm's
have
addressed
revisions
to
plans
and
to
amendments,
and
they
haven't
restrained
in
any
way
the
ability
to
apply
it
to
previous--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it's
true,
but
the...
the
way
these
documents
work,
as
i
understand
them,
is
that
if
there's
a
restriction,
something
you
can't
do,
they
say
it
expressly.
when
you...
remember,
the
default
rule
under
erisa,
of
course,
is
that
you
are
allowed
to
adopt
a
plan
amendment,
and
then
the...
they...
they
articulate
particular
restrictions--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the...
justice
scalia,
the
reason
that
the
irs
has
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
for
decades
is
threefold,
and
i
will
focus
on
the
text
because
that's
where
you
focus.
but
just
to
lay
them
out,
it's
going
to
be
the
text,
the
purposes
of
the
suspension
provision,
which
is
section
203(a)(3)(b),
and
what
will
best
protect
participants'
expectations.
you
focus
rightly
on
the
text.
the...
the
key
is
what
is
a
benefit
versus
what
is
a
suspension
of
benefit
payments.
as
i
said
in
the
introduction,
the
plan
participants
here
earned
a
benefit
and
that
is
a
life
annuity
in
a
service
only
pension.
so
they
were
able
to
retire
and
they
got
a
life
annuity
that's
available
to
them.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
would
be
prohibited.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
it
wouldn't
because
it
would
violate
the
vesting
rules.
let
me
continue.
there
are
two
parts
in
erisa,
and
this
is
set
out
in
your
alessi
opinion
in
1981.
you
have
to
accrue
a
benefit
and
then
you
vest
in
the
benefit.
the
accrual
is
when
you've
earned
the
benefit.
they
earned
the
benefit.
they
earned
their
pension.
then
they
had
to
vest
in
it;
that
is,
though
they've
earned
it,
they
have
what
alessi
calls
a
non-forfeitable
right
to
claim
it.
and
what
a
suspension
provision
does
it
says
your
benefit
still
exists.
their
benefit
is
a
life
annuity.
it
exists.
there
is
an
available
stream
of
payments.
there's
a
stream
of
payments
that
is
available
every
single
month.
that's
the
accrual
rule.
then
you
have
to
vest.
you
have
to
have
a
right
to
claim
it,
and
that's
what
a
suspension
provision
does.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is
your
claim
to
it
that
vests,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
could
give
you
the
language--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
apologize.
what
i
had
intended
to
say
is
that
your
claim
to
it
vests.
there
is
a
benefit
out
there,
this
life
annuity.
and
the
question
is:
do
you
have
the
right
to
claim
it
in
any
particular
month?
that's
the
structure
of
section
203
versus
section
204.
and
what
a
suspension
provision
does...
and
let
me
just
pause
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged,
the
plaintiffs
acknowledged,
that
when
we
suspend
their
benefit
payments,
we
are
not
decreasing
their
benefit.
what
we're
doing
is
that
they
have
sacrificed
their
claim
to
a
particular
benefit
in
any
given
month.
that's
why
congress
used
the
different
language,
suspension
of
benefit
payments
versus
the
actual
decrease
in
the
benefit.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
they
conceded--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
but
the
concession
is,
nonetheless--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
it
is
we
think,
justice
souter.
here's
why.
what
i
think
justice
scalia
was
focusing
on...
and
i
may
be
mistaken...
is
that,
look,
when
you
withhold
that
benefit
payment,
sort
of
give
me
a
break.
they're
not
getting
the
money.
you're
decreasing
their
benefit.
and
in
the
terminology
of
erisa,
that
is
actually
not
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
fair
enough.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
here
is
why
it
does
not.
the
real-world
value,
the
sense
that,
look,
this
is
more
desirable.
i
would
rather
have
a
benefit
that
has
less
suspension
provisions
than
one
that
has
more.
for
example,
hey,
it's
more
likely
i'm
going
to
get
the
money.
that
is
not
a
benefit
within
the
meaning
of
erisa.
the
benefit
is
the
life
annuity.
it's
a...
this
is...
the...
erisa
is,
of
course,
as
you've
often
said,
a
highly
reticulated
statute.
there
are
3,978
pages
of
regulations
implementing
it
in
about
6-point
font.
the
terms
of
art
are
highly,
highly
technical,
and
the
benefit
is
the
life
annuity.
it's
not
just
the
sense
that
i
like
it
more.
and
i
can
give
you
an
example.
section
203(c)
of
erisa...
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
reproduced
in
the
yellow
brief.
i
don't
think
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
track
it,
but
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
4a
and
5a.
this
is
a...
of
the
yellow
brief.
and
this
is
a
provision
under
which
plans
are
authorized
to
change
their
vesting
schedules.
and
so,
take
an
example.
there
are
two
ways
you
can
vest
under
erisa.
one
if
over
the
course
of
7
years
in
individual
steps.
another
is
so-called
cliff
vesting,
and
that
is,
you've
got
your
benefit.
you've
earned
it,
but
until
you've
been
in
service
for
5
years,
you
don't
have
any
legal
claim
to
it
notwithstanding
that
it's
out
there.
plans
under
section
203(c)
are
allowed
to
change
their
vesting
rules
so
that
if
someone
had
earned
2
years
of
vesting
credit,
the
plan
can,
nonetheless,
change
to
a
5-year
cliff
vesting
provision.
now,
that's
all
very
complicated,
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
it
makes
it
less
valuable
in
the
real-world
sense
for
the
plan
participants.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
unquestionably,
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
absolutely,
yes,
without
any...
any
doubt
whatsoever.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
section
203(c).
section
203(c)
explains
that
if
you
have
less
than
3
years
of
service,
you
are
not
allowed
to
object
to
the
change
in
vesting
conditions.
there
are
rules
under
erisa
that
say
that
even
though
you've
vested,
you
can,
in
effect,
be
divested.
that's
why
it
is
a
very
strange
structure
of
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
that's
why
this
is
in
1053.
there
are
two
sets
of
restrictions.
that
provision
that
i've
just
been
describing
would
not...
and
i
don't
think
there's
anybody
who
really
contends
it
would...
violate
1054,
what
we've
been
calling
204.
it
would
violate
1053.
you
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
would
violate
the
beginning
of
1053,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
take
you
to
1a
of
the
yellow
brief,
and
the
paragraph
involved
would
be
1...
excuse
me...
1053(a)(2)(a)
and
(b).
those
are
the
places--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
beginning
of
(2)
says,
except
as
provided
in
paragraph
4,
which
is
not
relevant,
a
plan
satisfies
the
requirements
of
this
paragraph
if
it
satisfies
the
requirements
of
subparagraphs
(a)
or
(b).
and
subparagraphs
(a)
or
(b)
which
i'll
read,
give
you
that
5-year
cliff
vesting
option
or
instead
over
the
course
of
7
years.
a
plan
satisfies
the
requirements
of
this
subparagraph
if
an
employee
who
has
completed
at
least
5
years
service
has
a
non-forfeitable
right
to
100
percent
of
the
employee's
accrued
benefit
derived
from
employer
contributions.
and
then
(b)
is
the
other
option,
the
7
years.
now,
i
have
spoken
and
i've
tried
to
emphasize
the
difference
between
a
benefit
and
the
suspension
of
benefit
payments,
but
it
is
also
important
to
deal
with
the
two
other
reasons
that
the
government--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
justice
stevens.
you
would
acquire
the
accrued
benefit
under
1054
as
it
accrued
over
time.
what
you
would
not
do
is
vest
in
that
benefit,
your
right
to
the
benefit
is
not
present.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
let
me
just
step
back.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
apologize.
let
me
just
step
back
and
explain
it
then.
there
are
two
things
that
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
be
able
to
collect
your
benefit
under
erisa.
it
has
to
accrue.
you
have
to
earn
it
under
1054.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
you
also
have
to
vest
in
it
under
1053.
justice
scalia,
you
had
intimated
a
hypothetical.
well,
look,
couldn't
the
plan
just
say,
hey,
we're
suspending
your
benefit
payments
and
wouldn't
that
violate
1054
because
you
lessened
the
value
of
the
benefit.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
you
couldn't
do
it,
but...
because
it
would
violate
1053.
someone
would
have
vested
in
the
benefit
and
you
would
be
divesting
them
of
it.
let
me
also
take
you...
because
we
do
contend
that
we
are
entitled
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sorry.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
let
me--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no
is
the...
is
the
short
answer
and
here's
the
longer
answer.
you
cannot
decrease
the
benefit
even
if
it
has
not
yet
vested.
let's
be
perfectly
clear.
if
i...
they
have
a
life
annuity
and
i
were
to
say
instead
of
paying
you
$1,650
a
month,
i'm
going
to
pay
you
$1,400
a
month,
notwithstanding
that
they
haven't
vested
in
it,
it
still
violates
the
accrual
rule.
but
when
you
come
to
the
question
of
the
suspension
of
benefit
payments,
which
throughout
erisa
is
a
different
concept
than
a
decrease
in
benefits,
when
you
come
to
a
suspension...
that
is,
your...
your
claim
to
the
benefit
payment
each
month...
i'm
taking
that
away
from
you...
that's
covered
by
1053.
and
our
point
is
that
this
plan
amendment
is...
and
the
government
agrees...
is
authorized
by
1053.
i
had
said
that
i
was
also
going
to
go
beyond
the...
move
from
the
text
to
the
purposes
underlying
the
statute
and
the
protection
of
participants'
legitimate
expectations.
but
before
doing
that,
i
do
want
to
point
to
the
regulation,
justice
scalia,
that
addresses
our
understanding
of
what
it
is
to
decrease,
and
we
contend
that
the
regulation,
which
is
published
after
notice
and
comment,
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
and
it
is...
is
reproduced
on
page
8a
of
the
yellow
brief,
and
i
will
just...
it's
quoted
in
our
brief
as
well.
and
it
explains
that
a
decrease
in
a
benefit
is
something
that
changes
the
computation
of
the
benefit.
this
does
not
change
the
computation
of
the
benefit.
it's
not
just
a
rhetorical
device.
it
is
a
theme
that
runs
throughout
the
provisions
of
erisa.
briefly,
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
plan's
expectations,
the
critical
point
is
that
the
suspension
rule
cannot
work
if
it...
this
is
section
203(a)(3)(b),
the
1053
provision...
cannot
work
if
it
does
not
apply
to
already
accrued
benefits.
the
point
of
the
statute
is
to
get
people
to
move
in
and
out
of
the
workforce.
and
if
you
are
not
allowed
to
apply
your
suspension
provision
to
existing
retirees,
you
cannot
influence
them
in
response
to
current
financial
conditions,
the
shape
of
the
construction
labor
market,
the
shape
of
the
current
trucking
market.
you
have
to
be
able
to
influence
their
decision
whether
or
not
to
work
or
not
to
work.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
does--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
i
think
the
critical
point
is
that
congress
in
section
1053,
in
203,
carefully
limited
the
power
of
the
plans;
that
is,
it's...
the
right
here
is
to
receive
your
pension.
that
right
is
completely
in
the
control
of
the
participants.
they
can
choose
not
to
go
back
to
work
or
to
go
back
to
work.
they
will
receive
their
benefits.
in
addition,
the
plan
is
only
allowed
to
limit
the
receipt
of
the
benefit
payment
during
periods
of
reemployment
in
the
same
industry,
trade,
or
craft
in
the
same
geographic
region
only
if
they
work
more
than
40
hours
of...
a
month,
and
a
variety
of
other
restrictions.
and
those
showed
that
congress
was
cabining
the
authority
of
plans
so
that
they
didn't
unduly
restrict
the
ability
of
plan
participants
to
go
back
to
work.
but
it
is,
i
think,
absolutely
critical,
to
return
to
the
point,
that
1053(a)(3)(b),
the
suspension
rule,
cannot
function
as
congress
intended
and
that
is
what
the
irs
concluded
if
it
does
not
apply
to
already
accrued
benefits.
we
could
not
encourage
or
discourage
the
plan
participants
to
go
back
to
work
or
not
to
go
back
to
work
and
thus
calibrate
the
pension
payments
that
are
coming
into
the
plan
if
it
did...
if
our
suspension
provision
did
not
apply
to
their
benefits.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
the
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
four
points.
the
first
deals
what
kind
of
promises
we
can
make
to
participants
that
they
can
enforce.
the
promise
can
only
go
in
one
direction.
that
is,
if
we
promise
them
we
will
not
change
the
suspension
rules,
if
they...
trustees
put
that
provision
in
and
the
employees
and
the
participants
rely
on
it,
we...
that...
to...
to
change
that
would
violate
the
plan
and
they
would
have
a
right
under
502
to
enforce
it.
but,
justice
scalia,
there
is
no
way
that
there's
a
middle
ground
under
which
the
plans
flag
for
the
participants,
hey,
this
is
open
to
a
change
because
204(g)...
if
they
win,
they'll
win
under
204(g).
204(g)
is
categorical.
you
can't
reduce
benefits
even
if
you
say
you're
going
to.
it's
just
no
way
you
can
do
it.
and
therefore,
the
only
middle
ground
is
under
our
provision.
if
participants
and
the
trustees
want
a
plan
provision,
making
it
a
concrete
promise,
we
won't
change
the
rules.
if
that's
in
the
plan,
it
would
be
enforceable
against
us.
but
it
isn't.
second--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
could
have,
although
i
would
say
that
the
provisions
cited
by
the
assistant
to
the
solicitor
general
talks
about
telling
a
person
who
is
in
retirement
about
a
material
change
in
the
suspension
rules,
and
that's...
that's
pretty
clear
to
my
mind.
but
it's
true.
it
could
have
gone...
we
could
have
been
even
more
clear,
but
this
is
a
right,
a
statutory
right,
that
we
have.
justice
o'connor,
justice
ginsburg,
what
does
203
cover?
it
covers
a
normal
retirement
benefit,
and
usually
what
we
think
of
as
an
early
retirement
benefit,
that
is,
the
unsubsidized
portion
of
an...
of
a
early
retirement
benefit.
the
third
is
it
is...
justice
breyer
is
absolutely
right
about
the
purpose
of
this
provision.
we
want
to
be
able
to
adjust
to
current
labor
conditions.
and
justice
souter,
the
statute
recognizes
that.
203(a)
has
a
special
rule
for
multiemployer
plans.
they
cover
things
like
construction
and
labor
where
the
markets
change
a
lot,
and
they
have
a
much
narrower
provision
in
203
for
single
employer
plans.
but
ultimately,
i
think
that
this
is
fairly
characterized
as
ambiguous.
the
agency
here
has
an
enormous
amount
of
experience
in
balancing
the
purposes
of
these
different
statutes
and
knowing
what's
different
between
a
decrease
and
a
suspension.
