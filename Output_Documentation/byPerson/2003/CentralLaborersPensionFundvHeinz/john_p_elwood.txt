mr.
john
p.
elwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
at
least
20
years,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
consistently
approved
the
amendment
of
pension
plans
to
add
or
expand
disqualifying
employment
provisions
within
the
scope
of
erisa's
suspension
rule,
and
it
has
permitted
those
amendments
to
be
applied
to
existing
benefit
accruals.
over
the
years,
literally
hundreds
of
plans
have
relied
on
the
flexibility
that
policy
afforded
in
determining
whether
a
plan--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that
is...
i
think
that...
well,
actually
i
think
that
because
the...
the
qualification
provisions
are
coextensive
with
the
erisa
provisions,
that
i
think
that
they
rise
or
fall
together.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
the...
the...
thing
is
the
language
of
the...
the
provisions
is
substantially
identical.
the
wording
is...
is
basically
exactly
the
same.
and
so
i
don't
know
that
there
has
been
a...
a
case
on
point
that
says
they
could
be
construed
differently,
but
i
think
there
would
be
an
uphill
road.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
correct,
but
they
have
been
vested
under
reorganization
plan
number
four
with
the
authority
to
construe
the
exact
same
provisions,
the
corresponding
provisions
of
title
i
of
erisa
that
we're
talking
about
here.
and
in...
when
they
issue
those
regulations,
they
typically
say
we're
construing
both.
we
use
the
code
verbiage,
but
we're
construing
both.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
they
have
been
charged
with
interpreting
these
provisions,
the
same
provisions
of
title
i
of
erisa,
the
204,
203
here
as
in
the
corresponding
provisions
of
the
code.
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
they're
just
as
expert
because
they're
exactly
the
same
the
language--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--in
any
event,
the...
the
department
of
the
treasury
has
been
charged
with
the
responsibility
and
because
it's
identical
language,
we
would
argue
that
they're
entitled
to
just
as
much
reference
under
that
as
under
title
i
of
erisa--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--the
labor
department
agrees
with
this
position.
the
labor
department,
again
under
internal
executive
branch
orders,
is
bound
by
the
irs
determinations
in
this
regard.
now,
if
i
could
get
back
to--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it
governs
normal
benefits
and
their
actuarial
equivalents.
so
to
the
extent
that
early
retirement
benefits
are
the
actuarial
equivalent
of
normal
retirement
benefits,
just
reduced
to
account
for
the
fact
they're
received
earlier
and
that
they'll
be
received
over
a
longer
period,
it
applies
of
its
own
force.
but
again,
the...
the
department
of
the
treasury
has
taken
the
purposes
of
203
into
account
when
it
construes
all
of
the
remaining
provisions.
justice
souter--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
cyclical
nature
of
industries
for
which
market...
which
are
covered
typically
by
multiemployer
plans.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
two
things.
first
of
all,
congress...
several
members
of
congress,
everyone
who
spoke
to
the
subject
during
the
debates
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
erisa,
indicated
that
the
idea
here
was
to
promote
industrial
stability
and
to
give
plans
the
flexibility,
when
market
conditions
warranted,
to
adopt
suspension
provisions.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
actually,
justice
scalia,
it
i
think
explicitly
indicates
that
it
contemplates
that.
if
you
look
at
pages
j.a.
46
and
64,
there
are
places
there
saying
that
basically
if
there
are
material
changes
in
the
suspension
provisions,
that
the
plan
will
notify
participants
of
them.
and
so
between
that
and
the
fact
that
the
plan
itself
specifically
states
on
page
50,
j.a.
50,
that
the
plan
is
amendable--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--oh,
sure.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the...
page
50
is
just
the
explanation
that
the
plan
is
amendable.
page
46
indicates
that...
that
there
can
be
change
in
the
suspension
rules.
it
says
if
benefits
have--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it's
under
(d)(1),
page
46.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
(d)(1).
that's
the...
basically
the
last
sentence
in
the
bottom
three
lines.
i'll
begin
earlier
than
that.
it
says,
if
benefits
have
been
suspended
and
payment
resumed,
new
notification
shall,
upon
resumption,
be
given
to
the
participant
if
there
has
been
any
material
change
in
suspension
rules,
which
we
take
to
be
an
indication
that
the
plan
contemplated
that
such
amendments
could
be
made.
justice
souter,
if
i
could--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--no.
it
says
if
there
has
been
any
material
change
in
the
suspension
rules,
which
we
think
to
apply
to
changes
in
when
a
suspension
can
be
enacted,
not
that
a
suspension
will
be
given
in
a
particular
case.
in
addition,
i
just...
mr.
goldstein
has
already
explained
a
bit
why
we
think
the
text
of
erisa
supports
this,
but
i
think
that
its
purposes...
the
purposes
of
the
anti-cutback
rule
are
consistent
with
this
because
what
congress
was
trying
to
protect
in
the
anti-cutback
rule
was
reduction
of
retirement
income.
and
i
think
that
that
is
broadly
satisfied
in
this
case
because
what
this
guarantee,
as
we've
explained,
is
an
annuity
and
a
certain
face
amount
that
can
never
be
reduced
in
face
amount.
and
the
only
time
it
is
not
paid
to
them
is
under
very
narrowly
cabined
circumstances
when
they
are,
by
definition,
receiving
essentially
receiving
replacement
income
from
the
same
industry,
the
same
trade
or
craft
in
the
same
geographic
area
that
has
funded
their
pension
plan.
and
i
think
under
those
sort
of
narrow
circumstances,
that
the...
the
purposes
of
the
anti-cutback
rule
are
satisfied.
in
addition,
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
a
point
that
justice
souter
raised.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
a
plan
could
adopt
a
suspension
rule
with
respect
to
future
plan
accruals
for
any
reemployment,
but
it
is
the
government's
position
that
because
what
congress
is
trying
to
control
here
was...
was
basically
to
give
plans
the
flexibility
so
that
their...
their
participants
would
not
have
to
compete
or,
rather,
have
to
subsidize
their
competitors--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it's
for
section
203(a)(3)(b),
or
1053(a)(3)(b),
which
is
set
forth
at
the
yellow
brief
on
page...
i
think
it's
1a
to
2a.
and
there
it
is
just...
it
just
identifies
the
circumstances
under
which
congress
has
authorized
the
suspension
rule,
which
we
read
to
be
able
to
be
applied
to
existing
benefit
accruals.
and
it
limits
it
to
application
in
the
case
of
a
multiemployer
plan,
which
we've
said
tend
to
be
industries
of
more
cyclical
swings,
to
cases
where
it's
employment
in
the
same
industry,
in
the
same
trade
or
craft,
and
in
the
same
geographic
area
covered
by
the
plan.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no.
it's
cited
from
the
outset.
it's
just...
it's
only
reproduced
in
the
reply
brief.
but
the...
but
the
very
same
provision
is
very
central
to
the
argument
set
forth
in
both
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
government's.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
okay.
i
appreciate
that.
but
i
just
wanted
to
clarify
one
thing
about
what
the
notice
of
required
modifications
says
because
the
notice
of
required
modifications
basically
sets
out
model
plan
language,
and
the
model
plan
language
in
this
case
that
existed
began...
first
appeared
in
1984
said
explicitly
it
may
be
added
to
existing
plans.
and
the
plan
language
itself
doesn't
contain
any
language
that
would
carve
our
existing
accruals,
so
that
by
definition
it
would
apply
to
existing
accruals.
and
i
think
that
if
the
treasury
had
intended
it
to
apply
only
to
future
benefit
accruals,
it
would
have
contained
language.
and
in
fact,
there
are
other
provisions
that
specifically
set
out
that
kind
of
limiting
language
so
it
can
only
be
applied
to
future
accruals.
so
i'd
say
that.
it's
not...
i...
i
think
it's
a...
a
reasonable
negative
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
that.
it's
not
going
out
on
a
limb
too
much.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
thank
you.
