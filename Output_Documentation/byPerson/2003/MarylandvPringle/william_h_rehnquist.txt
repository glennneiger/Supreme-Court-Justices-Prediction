thank
you,
mr.
bair.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
02-809,
maryland
against
pringle.
the
respondent,
pringle
was
a
front
seat
passenger
in
a
nissan
maxima
stopped
for
speeding
northwest
of
baltimore
about
3
o’clock
a.m.
by
a
police
officer.
there
were
two
other
occupants,
the
driver
and
the
back
seat
passenger.
the
officer,
upon
searching
the
car,
seized
$763
of
rolled
up
cash
from
the
glove
compartment
and
five
glassed
in
baggys
of
cocaine
from
between
the
back
sit
arm
rest
and
the
back
seat.
after
all
three
men
denied
ownership
of
the
cocaine
and
money
the
officer
arrested
each
of
them.
a
few
hours
later,
pringle
confessed
the
ownership
of
the
drug.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
by
a
divided
vote
reversed
pringle’s
conviction
concluding
that
pringle’s
confession
should
have
been
suppressed
as
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
arrest
because
the
officer
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
make
a
warrantless
arrest
to
them.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
a
warrantless
arrest
of
an
individual
in
a
public
place
for
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor
committed
in
the
officer’s
presence
is
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
if
the
arrest
is
supported
by
probable
cause.
it
is
uncontested
in
the
present
case
that
the
officer,
upon
recovering
the
five
plastic
glassine
baggies
containing
suspected
cocaine,
had
probable
cause
to
believe
a
felony
had
been
committed.
the
sole
question
is
whether
the
officer
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
pringle
committed
that
crime.
the
probable
cause
standard
is
incapable
of
precise
definition
or
quantification
in
the
percentages
because
it
deals
with
probabilities
and
depends
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
however,
the
substance
of
all
the
definitions
of
probable
cause
is
a
reasonable
ground
for
belief
and
guilt.
to
determine
whether
an
officer
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
an
individual,
we
examine
the
events
leading
up
to
the
arrest
and
then
decide
whether
these
historical
facts
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
an
objectively
reasonable
police
officer
amount
to
probable
cause.
in
this
case,
pringle
was
one
of
three
men
riding
a
car
in
the
early
morning
hours.
there
was
$763
of
rolled
up
cash
in
the
glove
compartment
directly
in
front
of
him.
five
plastic
glassine
baggies
of
cocaine
were
behind
the
back
seat
arm
rest
and
accessible
to
all
three
men.
upon
questioning,
the
three
men
failed
to
offer
any
information
with
respect
to
the
ownership
of
the
cocaine
or
the
money.
we
think
it
is
an
entirely
reasonable
inference
from
these
facts
that
any
or
all
of
the
three
occupants
had
knowledge
of
and
exercised
dominion
and
control
over
the
cocaine.
thus,
a
reasonable
officer
could
conclude
that
there
as
probable
cause
to
believe
pringle
committed
the
crime
of
possession
of
cocaine
either
solely
or
jointly.
pringle’s
arrest
therefore
did
not
contravene
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
so,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
is
reversed,
the
case
remanded
for
proceeding
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
