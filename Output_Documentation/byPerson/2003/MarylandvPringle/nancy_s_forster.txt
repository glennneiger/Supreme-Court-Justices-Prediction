ms.
nancy
s.
forster
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
unique
case
with
highly
unusual
facts,
and
the
reason
it
is
unique
is
because
of
the
facts...
not
because
of
the
facts
that
exist
so
much
in
this
case,
but
because
of
those
that
do
not
exist
here.
there
was
no
testimony
whatsoever
in
this
case
that
mr.
pringle
had
control
over
or
knowledge
of
the
drugs
hidden
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--well,
your
honor,
what
the
court
in
maryland
reviews
on
appeal
is
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing,
and
at
that
hearing
there
was
no
evidence
presented
whatsoever
that
the
officer
in
this
case
noticed
any
furtive
movements
by
mr.
pringle,
any
furtive
gestures,
that
he
said
anything
suspicious
at
the
scene,
or
that
he
acted
in
any
unusually
nervous
manner.
all
we
have
here--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--a
few
corrections,
if
i
may,
justice
o'connor--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--this
is...
3:00
a.m.
is
accurate,
3:16
a.m.
it
is
in
a
residential
area.
this
was
not
in
fact
a
high
crime
area.
and
i
think
that
under
the
totality
of
circumstances
we
have
to
put
that
in
context,
and
the
context
is
this,
that
it's
3:00
a.m.
on
a
saturday
night
with
a
car
of
three
young
men
in
their
twenties
in
a
residential
area,
and
i
think
that
anyone
who
has
children
of
that
age
knows
that
often
their
saturday
night
does
not
even
begin
until
10:00
or
11:00
p.m.--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--young
adult
children,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
but
what
we
have
here
with
respect
to
mr.
pringle
is
simply
presence
and
nothing
more.
we
have
no
further--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--if
i--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--your
honor,
if
i...
if
i
may,
with
respect
to
this
being
packaging...
the
drugs
packaged
that
is
indicative
of
sale
or
for
distribution,
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
was
anything
inconsistent
with
personal
use.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
that
there
are
a
lot
of
crack
cocaine
addicts
for
which
that
is
a
small
amount
of
personal
use.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
and,
your
honor,
also,
there's
a
problem
with
the
record
in
this
respect
with
regard
to
money--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--justice
souter,
the
actual
amount
did
not
come
out
until
the
trial.
that
never
came
out
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing,
and
in
fact,
the
amount
of
money
was
never
characterized
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing
by
the
officer
who
testified,
other
than
to
say
he
saw
the
sum
of
money,
that's
all.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
it
was
concealed
in
the
glove
compartment?
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
we
don't...
we
don't
know.
in
fact,
the
officer
who...
officer
snyder,
when
he
testified
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing,
simply
said
that
when
mr.
parlo,
the
driver
of
the
automobile,
went
to
retrieve
his
license
and
registration
from
the
glove
box,
that
is
when
i
saw
the
money.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
the
record
is
unclear.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
well,
the...
your
honor,
i
guess
the
point
is,
is
that
all
that
was
before
the
trial...
the
trial
judge
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing...
there
was
never
any
characterization
of
the
denomination,
the
amount,
nothing,
just
the
only
thing
that
was
said
was
the
money.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
at
times
i
do,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
yes.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
i
might
also
point
out
that
at
the
actual
trial,
the
expert
who
did
testify
for
the
state
with
regard
to
the...
whether
or
not
this
was
an
intent
to
distribute...
testified
that
without
mr.
pringle's
confession
and
this
statement,
he
could
not
in
fact
say
that
this
was
consistent
with
an
intent
to
distribute
based
solely--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--yes.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
no,
that's
not
the
answer.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
justice
ginsburg,
in
this
case,
the
officer
could
arrest
mr.
parlo,
the
driver
of
the
automobile,
because
i
think
it
is
universally
accepted
that
we
can
impute
the
driver
owner
of
an
automobile
with
the
knowledge
that
he
knows
what
is
in
his
car
and
he
has
exclusive
control
over
that
which
is
in
his
car.
so
the
officer
here
should
have
arrested
mr.
parlo.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps...
i
mean,
and
of
course,
this
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court,
that
perhaps
because
of
mr.
smith,
the
backseat
occupant,
may
also
have
been
arrested
given
that
the
nature
of
an
armrest
is
not
really
a
normal
repository
that
one
would
place
personal
items
in--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--maybe
mr.
smith.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
but
definitely--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--definitely
not
mr.
pringle,
but
of
course,
if
we're
going
to
use
mr.
pringle's
confession
in
determining
in
hindsight,
we
need
not
have--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--justice
ginsburg,
i
agree
with
that...
that
perhaps
it
would
not
be
difficult,
given
the
compact
nature
of
this
car.
however,
there
was
no
testimony
that
in
fact
that
anyone
saw
mr.
pringle
do
that,
number
one,
and
number
two--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--well,
i...
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
well,
my
second
response
would
be
this,
that
i
think
that
it
would
be
highly
unreasonable
that
mr.
smith,
the
backseat
passenger,
would
allow
mr.
pringle
to
turn
around
and
store
the
drugs
in
the
armrest
right
next
to
him.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
your
honor,
the
maryland...
with
all
due
respect,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
made
a
mistake
in
this
case
because
what
they
said
in
their
opinion--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--your
honor,
what
the
court
of
appeals
incorrectly
did
in
this
case
was...
and
they
dropped
a
footnote
to
suggest
that
it
was
unclear
to
them
whether
or
not
there
was
a
separate
motion
to
suppress
hearing
or
whether
there
was
a
combined
motion
to
suppress
trial
proceeding.
in
fact,
that's
incorrect.
there
was
a
separate
motion
to
suppress
hearing.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
for
purposes
of
mr.
pringle's
position,
the
fact
that
that
money
is
concealed,
really
it
makes
no
difference
the
amount.
however,
if
the...
as
the
petitioner
and
the
u.s.
solicitor
find
the
amount
to
be
significant,
i
think
we
should
have
a
clearer
record.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
well,
justice
breyer,
that
assumes
that
the
driver
did
not
put
it
there
before
he
picked
up
his
passengers.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
if
it's...
if
it's
sandwiched
between
the
armrest
as
it's
pushed
up
against
the
seat,
no,
i
don't.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
justice
ginsburg,
i
can
tell
you
as
a
criminal
defense
lawyer
that
defendants
consent
all
the
time
when
they
have
a
car
full
of
drugs
and
they
know
the
drugs
are
there.
it's
not
unusual
and
it--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--except
that...
how
this
case
is
similar
to
di
re
is
that
in
di
re
this
court
held
that
if
the
act...
the
criminal
activity,
the
ongoing
criminal
activity,
is
not
visible
to
the
occupants,
the
mere
presence
is
not
enough
on
which
to
have
probable
cause
to
arrest.
and
here
we
have
concealed
drugs
and
nothing
more
than
mr.
pringle's
presence
in
the
front
seat.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
i
agree
with
that.
but
however,
that
would
only
point
more
closely
to
mr.
smith,
the
backseat
person
sitting
directly
next
to
the
armrest,
not
to
mr.
pringle,
the
front
seat
passenger.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
well,
justice
souter,
the...
the
problem
with
that,
of
course,
it's
pure
speculation,
but
we
don't
even
know
if
this
glove
compartment
was
locked
or
unlocked.
what
we
know
is
that
it
was
opened
by
the
driver
at
the
time
he
was
asked
to
retrieve
his
license
and
registration.
whether
he
had
to
unlock
that
glove
compartment
is
not
clear
at
all
for
the
record.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
but,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that
if
we
want
to
speculate
that
perhaps
then
we
could
say
that
that
would
be
enough,
but
probable
cause
requires
far
more
than
speculation.
it
requires
a
fair
probability,
at
least
of
complicity,
and
we
simply
don't
have
the
facts
in
this
case
that
would
support
that
fair
probability
with
respect
to
mr.
pringle,
because
all
the
record
shows
is
that
mr.
pringle
was
present
in
a
car
where
drugs
were
found
hidden.
and
if
i
may
address
the
common
enterprise
theory
that
both
the
petitioner
and
the
u.s.
solicitor
relies
on
in
this
case,
the
problem
with
the
common
enterprise
theory
is
that
the
cases
that
they
cite
in
support
of
that
involved
ongoing
criminal
activity
that
was
conducted
in
plain
view.
you
have
the
ulster
county
case,
where
the
court
found
that
the
weapons,
one
of
which
was
described
as
as
large
as
a
cannon,
that
was
in
plain
view
of
all
of
the
occupants
of
the
car.
and
in
the
houghton
case...
so
it
was
reasonable
in
the
ulster
county
case,
or
if
that
had
in
fact
been
the
issue
in
that
case,
which
it
was
not--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--well--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--justice
breyer,
the
inference
that
the
backseat
passenger
may
stuff
the
drugs
in
the
armrest--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--but
certainly--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--well,
no,
your
honor,
i...
perhaps
i...
i
was
not
clear.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
no,
your
honor,
i--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--i
don't
think
he
could
be
arrested.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
well,
certainly
if
he's
the
front
seat
passenger
and
not
the
driver
he's...
he's
along
for
the
ride.
he's
not
necessarily
the
person
transporting--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--under
those
circumstances,
your
honor,
i
think
you'd
have
a
much
closer
case.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
well,
the
crime
of
possession
requires
not
just
knowledge,
but
it
also
requires
the
intent
to
exercise
dominion
and
control
over
the
drug.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
yes.
that
would--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--there
would
have
to
be
some
reasonable
inference--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--i
think
it
is
not
just
on
those
facts
alone.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
no,
your
honor,
nor
at
the
trial.
only
officer
snyder
testified
at
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing
for
the
state.
if
i
may
go
back
to
the
common
enterprise
theory,
as
i
said,
the
cases
that
the
state
and
the
u.s.
solicitor
rely
on
here
involved
criminal
activity
conducted
in
plain
view,
and...
which,
from
which
an
officer
could
reasonably
infer,
i
think,
a
common
nefarious
enterprise.
we
have
a...
less
than
one
gram
of
cocaine
in
this
case
that
is
hidden,
hidden,
concealed
in
the
backseat
armrest,
and
secondly,
again,
with
respect
to
this
being
a
commercial
quantity
of
drugs,
there
is
simply
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
that.
this
was--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--yes,
it
was,
but
that,
again--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--that,
again,
your
honor,
is
not
inconsistent
with
personal
use,
and
certainly
i
should
think
that
if
this
police--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--that...
that
is
correct.
the
charge
was
possession--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--and
possession
with
intent.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
however,
justice
rehnquist,
here
this
amount
is
not
indicative
of
an
operation
that
requires
the
participation
of
more
than
one
person.
this
is
an
amount
that,
if
it's
for
sale,
it's
for
sale--
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
then
it
would
still
require
speculation
on
the
part
of
this
police
officer
to
assume
that
one
was
connected
to
the
other.
i
think
that
the
only
common
enterprise
that
reasonably
could
have
been
inferred
from
the
facts
of
this
case
is
a
common
enterprise
to
go
from
one
destination
to
another
and
nothing
more
than
that,
and
given
the
concealed
nature
of
the
drugs
in
this
case,
the
lack
of
any
suspicious
activities
on
mr.
pringle's
part,
and
the
lack
of,
i
think,
any
reasonable
inference
pointing
to
complicity
that
he
possessed
the
hidden
drugs,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
correctly
held
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
arrest
mr.
pringle,
and
this
ruling
should
be
affirmed.
ms.
nancy
s.
forster
thank
you.
