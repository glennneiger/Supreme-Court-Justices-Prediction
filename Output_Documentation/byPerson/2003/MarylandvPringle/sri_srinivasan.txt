mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
apparent
to
the
officer
at
the
scene
established
probable
cause
for
respondent's
arrest.
of
particular
significance,
the
officer
uncovered
drugs
that
were
packaged
for
distribution
and
that
were
concealed
in
the
location
in
which
they
were
readily
discoverable
by
the
other
passengers.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it's...
we
don't
intend--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--we
don't
intend
to
suggest
a
broad
rule,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes,
it's
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
and
it
will
turn
on
contextual
factors
that
are
present
in
any
particular
case.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
what...
what
we
intend
to
say
is
that
ordinarily
when
drugs
that
are
packaged
for
distribution
are
found
in
a
location
in
which
they're
readily
discoverable
by
the
other
passengers,
a
reasonable
officer
can
fairly
conclude
that
there's
a
fair
probability
that
each
passenger
is...
is
aware
of
the
drugs,
but
of
course
in
particular
cases--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
the
inference
is
tethered
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
in
cases
that
present
different
facts,
for
example,
if
a
child
was
in
the
car
of...
if,
as
was
earlier
discussed,
a
hitchhiker
were
in
the
car,
the
probable...
probable
cause
calculus
would
be
different.
but
in
this
case
there
was
no
reason
to
suspect
that
any
of
the
individuals
was
uninvolved
in
the
possession
of
the
cocaine.
in
fact,
what's
particularly
significant
in
this
case
in
our
view
is
the
location
in
which
the
drugs
were
found,
because
they
were
found
wedged
behind
the
rear
seat
armrest,
which
apparently
is
the
type
of
armrest
that's
adjustable
in
an
up
or
down
position.
the
very
purpose
of
that
type
of
armrest
is
to
give
the
passenger
an
option
according
to
his
preference
whether
the
position...
the
armrest
in
one
position
or
the
other,
so
it's
highly--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i...
it...
there's
a...
i
think
there's
a
different
question
concerning
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
and
the
determination
by
an
officer
whether
to
proceed
with
charges.
just
because
the
officer--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
might
well
have
been,
justice
stevens,
because
an
officer's
not
required
to
believe
the
version
of
events
that's
given
to
him
by
people
on
the
scene.
it
might
well
be
the
case
that
they
have
a
coordinated
plan
in
advance
to
pin
the
blame
on
a
particular
person
as
opposed
to
the
other
two,
and
an
officer
can
take
into
account
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
making
that
type
of
assessment.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
not
necessarily
a
common
enterprise.
it
could
be
any
one
of
the
three
or
it
could
be
all
of
them
or
some
combination
of
the
three
of
them,
and
the
combination
of
those
various
scenarios
rose
to
the
level
of
a
fair
probability
that
respondent
was
involved
with
the
cocaine.
and
as
i
was...
as
i
was
saying,
that's
particularly
the
case
because
they
were
concealed
behind
the
armrest,
which
is
a
type
of
instrument
that
affirmatively
invites
manipulation
by
a
passenger,
so
if
one
of
the
occupants
of
the
vehicle
alone
were
responsible
for
carrying
cocaine,
it
seems
quite
unlikely
that
he
would
have
chosen
the
area
behind
the
armrest
as
a
place
to
conceal
it
from
the
other
passengers.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
the
probable
cause
standard
works
the
same.
in
both
situations
the
question
would
be
whether
there's
a
fair
probability.
now--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
it's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it's
often
the
case
that
prosecutors
will
have
more
rigorous
standards
as
a
matter
of
internal...
matter
of
internal
guidelines.
and
for
example,
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
manual,
it
dictates
that
prosecutors
in
the
federal
system
need
to
ensure
that
it's
likely
that
they'll
be
able
to
obtain
a
conviction
on--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
the
nature
of
the
application
of
the
probable
cause
standard
is
different
in
the
prosecutorial
stage
because
the
prosecutor
is
identifying
a
particular
offense,
laying
out
the
facts
to
support
that
offense,
and
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--correct.
that
remains
constant
in
both
scenarios.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there's
a
different...
there's
a
different
question
whether
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
convict
as
presented
by
the
prosecutor
and
whether
the
prosecutor
has
enough
to
go
forward
with
the
charges.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
as
long
as
there's
probable
cause
to
go
forward,
the
prosecutor
can
go
forward
with
the
charges.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
he
could
go--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
that's...
that's
different
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
even
assuming
that
it
were
an
equal
likelihood
that
each
of
them
independently
were
involved
in
the
offense,
the
prosecutor
could
go
forward
in
that
situation,
but
it's
highly
unlikely
that
he
would
go
forward
in
that
situation
because...
because
he's
unlikely
to
obtain
to
a
verdict
in
his
favor.
so
there's
institutional
incentives--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
not
should
bring
cases--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--may,
under
the
constitution.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
that's
why,
i
think,
prosecutors
typically
enforce
upon
themselves
a
more
rigorous
obligation
than
the
probable
cause
standard.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
there's
no
case
that
i'm
aware
of
that
says
that
they
can't
proceed
where
there's
probable
cause.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
in...
in
the
federal
system--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there's
federal
guidelines
that
spell
out
when
federal
prosecutors
are
supposed
to
bring
cases
to
trial,
but
i'm
not
aware
that
that's
required
by
federal
law
or
by
the
constitution.
each
prosecutor's
office
might
have
their
own--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't...
i
don't
have
the
particular
provision.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
correct.
each
prosecutor's
office
might
have
different
standards.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
well,
the
deficiencies
in
the
maryland
court's
probable
cause
analysis,
we
think,
are
particularly
are
apparent
when
one
considers
the
implications
for
officers
at
the
scene
in
circumstances
like
this
case,
because
apparently
the
up-shot
is
that
officers
either
could
arrest
no
one
or
that
they
could
arrest
the
driver
alone,
and
the
latter
situation
seems
unsound
because
perhaps
the
least
likely
scenario
in
circumstances
like
this
case
is
that...
that
the
driver
was
acting
alone
and
carrying
the
contraband
in
the
car,
because
if
the
driver
in
fact
were
acting
alone,
one
might
expect
that
he
would
conceal
the
contraband
in
a
location
in
which
it
was
not
so
readily
discoverable
by
the
other
passengers.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
possible
that
innocent
persons
will
be
arrested
and
bound
over
in
circumstances
like
in
this
case,
but
the
probable
cause
standard
accepts
that
possibility
as
the
cost
of
ensuring
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws.
in
fact,
this
court
reiterated
in
wardlow
recently
that
the
probable
cause
standard
accepts
that
innocent
persons
may
be
arrested
on
occasion.
that's
simply
the
cost
of
a
functioning
criminal
justice
system.
