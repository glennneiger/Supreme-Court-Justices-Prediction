mr.
gary
e.
bair
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
officer
stopped
the
car
respondent
was
riding
in
and
found
drugs
packaged
for
distribution
in
the
rear
seat
armrest,
and
then
also
found
a
large
amount
of
cash
in
the
glove
compartment--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
rear
seat
armrest
was
pushed
up
against
the
rear
seat.
the
officer
merely
folded
it
down
and
then
the
drugs
appeared,
and
these
are
drugs
that
were
packaged
in
five
separate
individual
packages
that
were
packaged
for
distribution
at
$20
a
bag.
the
officer
also
found
$763
in
a
rolled-up
ball
of
cash
in
the
glove
compartment,
and
there...
at
that
time
there
was
individualized
probable
cause
that
focused
on
all
three
people
in
that
car,
and
this
is
so
for
three
principal
reasons.
first--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--at
the
end
of
the
day,
all
three
were
arrested,
respondent
confessed,
and
said
the--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
he
was
found--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--he
was
found
guilty
both
of
possession
and
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
the
other
two
were
not
charged
formally
after
respondent
confessed.
the
officer
made
a
discretionary
decision
not
to
charge
the
other
two
at
the
station
house
after
respondent
confessed
to
this
crime.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
there
would
have
been.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i...
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
there
would
have
been.
i
think,
given
the
circumstances
of
this
arrest,
the
mere
fact
that
one
of
the
three
confessed
doesn't
ultimately
determine
that
the
other
two
were
not
culpable.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
would
say
they're
identical,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
believe
so.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
believe
there
would
have
been
probable
cause
to
charge
and
to
take
the
cases
to
trial.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
so--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--my
understanding
from
the
case
law,
your
honor,
is
that
probable
cause
is
probable
cause,
be
it
to
search,
to
arrest,
or
it...
i
think
it's
a
fluid
concept,
obviously
depending
on
the
exact
context,
and
i'm
not
saying
that
a
prosecutor
would
not
exercise
discretion
as
would
a
police
officer
in
a
given
case
not
to
take
a
case
forward.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
it
is
and--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
believe
so,
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
so.
now,
in
this
case,
of
course,
there
was--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i'm
not
sure
it's
a
greater
burden.
i
think
the
prosecutor's
decision,
of
course,
is
looking
forward
to
trial
where
they
know
that
they
have
to
prove
the
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
know
they
have
to
get
past
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
the
police
officer
on
the
scene
is
making
the
same
type
of
decision
vis-a-vis
probable
cause
but
it's
in
a
very
different
context.
i
think
that's
the
difference.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
one
factor
that
would
significantly
change
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
here
would
be,
for
instance,
if
the
drugs
had
been
found
on
the
person
of
one
of
the
passengers.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
if
it
had
been--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--in
the
door?
mr.
gary
e.
bair
not
in
this
case,
no.
i
think...
i
think
if...
if
the
drugs
are
found
in
a
common
area
of
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
car--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
the
trunk
changes
things
a
little
bit,
but
of
course
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
that's--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--it
certainly
is
not
as
accessible,
and
of
course
it's
not
as
immediately
accessible,
but,
for
instance,
if
there
had
been
a
large
quantity
of
drugs
in
the
trunk
or
if
there
had
been
a
dead
body
in
the
trunk,
i
think
then
there
is
a...
the
calculus
changes
in
terms
of
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
i
think
if
it
were
that
situation,
even
though
that
particular
evidence
was
in
the
trunk,
i
think
there's
still
a...
a
strong
inference
that
could
be
drawn
that
everyone
in
the
car
knew
about
it,
because
who
would
take
the
chance
in
terms
of
taking
along
innocent
passengers--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
understand.
i
think
in
that
case
there
would
be
a
much
closer
case,
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
vis-a-vis
all
three
occupants
of
the
car.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
not...
not--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think,
obviously
with...
with...
with
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
anytime
you
change...
and,
of
course,
some
of
these
are
going
to
have
more
minor
impact,
some
are
going
to
have
more
major
impact.
but
in
this
case
you
had,
of
course,
3:16
in
the
morning,
three
men
who
were
roughly
of
the
same
age
who
appeared
to
be
intimately
connected
with
one
another,
you
had
the
drugs
and
the
money.
i
think
here's
a
very
strong
case,
but
i
agree,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
don't
know
that
four
people
would
change
things.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
within
the--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i'm
not
sure
it
changes
it
significantly,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
most
significant--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
if
you
have
identical
circumstances
to
these
in
terms
of
the
time,
how
well-acquainted
they
all
appeared,
the
fact
there
was
money,
the
fact
that
there
were
drugs
packaged
for
distribution.
it
appeared
to
the
officer,
a
reasonable
inference,
that
there
was
a
drug
distribution
common
enterprise.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
well,
the
evidence,
at
the
time
the
officer
made
the
arrest,
i
think
he
could
draw
an
inference
that
there
was
cash
proceeds
perhaps
of
former
drug
sales,
prior
drug
sales,
and
there
were
five
individually
packaged
crack...
hits
of
crack
cocaine.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes,
it
was
both
simple
possession
and
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
and
he
was
convicted.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
a
bus
is
different,
your
honor.
i
think
a
bus
changes
things
significantly
in
the...
in
the
context
of,
of
course,
the
numbers
of
people
are
much
greater,
and
then
there's--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
that
would
affect
obviously
the
totality
of
circumstances
as
well.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
you
can,
your
honor.
i
think
both
the
restatement
of
torts,
the
model
code
of
pre-arraignment
procedure,
and
just
the...
the
nature
of
probable
cause
would
permit
that,
because
we're
talking
about--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--same
situation
where
you
have,
say,
two
people,
only
one
of
whom
could
be
guilty
of
the
crime.
you
could
still
have...
you
still
would
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
both.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
three
is...
is--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
so.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
well,
of
course.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
and...
and--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
we
can't
draw...
the
court
in
gates
said
that
you
cannot
quantify
probable
cause.
you
have
to...
in
those
circumstances--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--no,
it
does
not
mean
probable.
clearly--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i'm
not...
i
think
there's
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
there,
but
clearly
from
the
case
law
of
this
court,
it
means
a
fair
probability,
it
means
something
greater
than
reasonable
suspicion
under
terry--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
don't
know
that
i
could,
your
honor.
i
really
don't
know
that
it's
useful
to--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--yes.
your...
the
cases
of
this
court
has
said--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think...
i
think
three
people
clearly
would
be--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--probably,
probably.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
with
that,
but
again,
in
illinois
v.
gates,
this
court
said
we
will
not,
we
cannot,
it's
not
useful
to
try
to
quantify
probable
cause
in
that
way,
we
still
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
beyond
whether
there
are
two
people
or
three
people
or
whatever.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
of
course,
on
the
government's
theory
i
don't
think
it
would
matter,
because
they
say
you
can
infer
a
conspiracy,
and
i
suppose
then
the
whole
bus
could
be
in
the
conspiracy,
but
if
it's
an
individual
approach,
which
i
think
you're
taking,
then
the
number
of
people
might
make
a
difference.
i
think
so.
now,
of
course,
it
would
depend
on...
on
the
crime
that
the
probable
cause
was
going
to.
in
this
particular
crime,
of
course,
drugs
can
be
jointly
and
constructively
possessed,
so
clearly
in
this
particular
car,
all
three
of
the
people
could
be
guilty
of
the
crime,
not
just
one.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
don't
know
that
it
does.
i
think
our
positions
are
basically
the
same.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
in
our
case,
absolutely,
absolutely.
in
our
case,
clearly--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--well,
i
think
we
did,
your
honor.
i
think
we
argued
in
the
state
court
that
because
drugs
can
be
jointly
and
constructively
possessed,
that
any
one,
two,
or
three
of
the
individuals
in
the
car
were...
were
guilty
of
this
crime.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
if...
if
it's
undisputed,
and
of
course,
that's
going
to
be
a
difficult
situation
to...
to
know
that
there's
no
actual
connection--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--if
it's--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--if
it's
undisputed,
then
i
think
that
significantly
changes,
because
i
think
a
lot...
a
core
concept
here
is
this
notion
of
common
enterprise,
that
when
you
have
people
in
a
car
together,
particularly
a
small
passenger
car,
there's
an
inference,
i
think
in
this
case
a
very
strong
inference,
that
all
three
of
these
people
were
engaged
in
a
common
enterprise.
so--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
guess
it
would
be...
of
course,
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
because
you
had
the
money
in
the
glove
compartment
of
the
car
and
the
drugs
in
the
backseat
of
the
car,
so
that--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
it
adds--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--well,
certainly
the
money
without
the
drugs
would
be
a...
a
different
case
than
the
drugs
without
the
money.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
no,
and...
and
that,
of
course,
goes
back
to
whether
it's
undisputed
in
some
way,
i
don't
know
quite
how
it
would
be
undisputed.
you've
always
got
the...
the
officer
who
on
the
scene
is
making
a
reasonable
judgement
from
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
and
one
of
those
is,
i
don't
have
to
believe
the
criminal
or
criminals
in
this
car.
i
know
there
are
drugs
in
the
car,
we
have
a
known
crime
here
being
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
officer,
possession
or
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
drugs.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
two...
two
answers
to
that,
justice
stevens.
one,
of
course,
is
you
would
measure
the
probable
cause
by
an
objective
standard
and
not
by
the
subjective
standard
of
that
particular
police
officer.
the
other
is--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--the
other
is,
it
could
be
that--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--it
could
be,
your
honor,
that
the...
the
driver
knew
the
hitchhikers
and
that's
why
he
picked
them
up.
i
mean,
a
lot
of
times
people--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
so,
yes.
yes,
i
think
there
would
be.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
so,
i
think
so,
that...
that
if
the,
again,
one...
the
other
inference
among
the...
the...
the
indicators
of
a
common
enterprise
would
be,
i
think
it's
unusual
that
several
people
are
going
to
be
taking
a
chance
driving
around,
either
with
evidence
of
a
murder
or
evidence
of
a
drug
conspiracy.
they're
not
simply
as
a
matter
of
reasonable
inferences
that
an
officer
can
draw,
take
the
chance
of
having
innocent
people
along.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i...
i'd
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
just
wanted
to
first
clarify
any
record
inconsistencies
or...
or
clarifications
that
might
be
in
order.
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
which
is
at
appendix
page
3a
to
the
petition
for
cert,
makes
very
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals,
the
highest
court
in
maryland,
construed
the
record
as
the
officer
seeing
a
large
amount
of
money
rolled
up
in
the
glove
compartment,
and
it
totaled
$763.
that
is
clearly
stated
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
and
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
trial
transcripts
at
pages
83
to
84.
it
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix
but
it
is
in
the
record
in
the
case,
the
trial
transcript
pages
83
to
84
from
the
trial
on
april
10th
of
2000.
the
police
officer
who
arrested
respondent
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
saw
a
large
roll
of
money
in
the
glove
compartment
and
that
it
totaled
$763,
so
clearly
there
is
record
support
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found.
with
regard
to
the
glove
compartment
being
closed
or
locked,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
ever
indicating
that
the
glove
compartment
was
locked.
i
think
the
only
natural
inference
from
this
record
is
that
it
was
closed
at
the
time
the
car
was
stopped.
the
officer
saw
the
drug...
excuse
me...
saw
the
money
in
the
glove
compartment
when
the
driver
went
to
retrieve
his
vehicle
registration,
and
then
after
the
officer
obtained
consent
to
search
the
car,
he
then
opened
the
glove
compartment
again
and
seized
the
money.
i
think
it's
ironic
that
the
rule
that
is
being
suggested
by
respondent
is
the
bright
line
rule
that
the
driver
should
always
be
arrested.
i
think
that's
absolutely
inconsistent
with
this
court's
fourth
amendment
law.
in
closing,
unless
the
court
has
any
questions--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--yes.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
your
honor,
i
think
all...
the
nature
of
probable
cause
is
that
the
officer
is
entitled
to
accept
under
the
totality
of
the
facts
any
of
those
inferences.
i
think
any...
any--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--under
maryland
law,
they
have
to
have
an
intent
to
exercise
control
over
the
drugs.
if
they
simply
knew
about
it,
that
would
not
be
enough
for
a
conviction,
but
i
think--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--yes,
but
i
think
for
probable
cause
purposes,
clearly
that
would
be
sufficient.
thank
you,
your
honor.
