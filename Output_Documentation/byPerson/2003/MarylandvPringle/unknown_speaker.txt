unknown
speaker
what...
the
rear
seat
armrest
was
pushed
up--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
the
drugs
were
behind
the...
the
armrest?
unknown
speaker
at
the
end
of
the
day,
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
and
respondent
was
a
front
seat
passenger?
unknown
speaker
he's
the
one
who
confessed?
unknown
speaker
and
was
found
ultimately
guilty
of--
unknown
speaker
--some
drug-related
offense?
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
two?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
all
three
at
the
time
they
were
found?
unknown
speaker
was
there
probable
cause
sufficient
to
support
charges
at
a
preliminary
hearing--
unknown
speaker
--against
all
three?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
additional
requirement
for
establishing
probable
cause
at
a
preliminary
hearing
above
and
beyond
what's
needed
for
the
arrest,
or
are
they
identical,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
under...
under
that
view,
assume
no
confession,
hypothetical
case,
under
that
view,
these
people,
all
of
the
three
could
have
been
bound
over
for
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
under
that
view,
any
motion
to
dismiss
prior
to
trial
would
have
to
be
denied?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
what
happens
in
that
case
is
the
judge
says,
and
i
want
to
tell
you
right
up
front
i
think
this
is
a
very
skimpy
case,
you'd
better
come
up
with
something...
i
guess
that's
the
way
it
works--
unknown
speaker
--but
there's...
but
the...
as
justice
o'connor
said,
it's
probable
cause
and
it's
the
same
standard...
excuse
me...
it's
the
same
standard
to
bind
over
on
arraignment
as
it
is
for
the
officer
to
arrest?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
preliminary
hearing
is
largely
a
matter
of
maryland
law,
isn't
it,
or
state
law?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
is
there
any...
any
constitutional
requirement
that
there
be
a
preliminary
hearing
before
a
criminal
case
is
tried?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
even
under
the
constitution,
if
it's
a
federal
case,
both
the
indictment
and
the...
or
the
information
shows
simply
probable
cause,
that's
enough
to
bind
over?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
say
it's
fluid,
that...
that
concerns
me.
i
was
somewhat
puzzled
by
what
the
government
said
in
its
brief,
page
26
to
28,
it
says,
well,
you
know,
it's
fluid,
the
prosecutor
takes
a
second
look
and
it...
it
sounds
as
if
the
prosecutor
has
a
greater
burden,
but
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
law.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
is
this
very
fact-specific
so
that
it
might
come
out
differently
if
the
money
and
the
drugs
had
been
located
in
some
little
pocket
next
to
the
driver
as
opposed
to
some
rear
seat
passenger
or
other
passenger?
unknown
speaker
no,
that
wasn't
my
question.
what
if--
unknown
speaker
--they
were
found
very
close
to
the
driver,
you
know,
sometimes
there's
a
little
pocket
right
next
to--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
door,
on
the
driver's
side.
suppose
it
were
there
but
you
had
a
passenger
in
the
front
and
in
the
rear.
any
different
result?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
trunk?
unknown
speaker
why
a
little
bit?
i
thought
this
whole
case
was
predicated...
your
whole
case
was
predicated
on
those
drugs
between
the
armrest
and
the
backseat
were
accessible
to
all
three
people
in
that
car.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
you
have
something
in
a
locked
trunk,
it
truly
is
not
accessible
to
the
passengers.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
stick
to
the
five...
these
five
bags
that
were
stuck
in
a
ziploc
bag.
the
ziploc
bag
is
in
the
trunk,
not
a
dead
body.
unknown
speaker
but
under--
--okay,
what
about
the--
--under...
under
your
view,
if...
if
the
car
is
in
a
high
crime
area
and
some
mother
gets
a
ride
from
her
son
who
she
perhaps
doesn't
know
has
been
involved
in
drugs,
then
if
drugs
are
found
anywhere
in
that
car,
she's
subject
to
arrest
and...
and
sufficient
for
charge?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
suppose
it's
at...
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
she's
going
to
the
grocery
store,
we
don't
have
it
at
3:00
a.m.
in
an
area
where
drugs
are
frequently
sold.
does
that
enter
into
the
calculus?
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
had
been
four
people
in
the
car?
unknown
speaker
how
about
six?
unknown
speaker
or
what
if
it
was
a
minivan
and
there
were
eight
in
the
minivan?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
think
with
eight
people
in
the
minivan
you
could
arrest
all
eight
and
hold
them
over
for
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
the
distribution,
as
i
understand
it,
was
just
enough
to
take
care
of
a
big
party.
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
were
for
sale,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
and
the
charge
was
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
how
about
if
it
had
been
a
bus?
now,
we've
gone
from
the
sedan
to
the
minivan,
how
about
the
bus?
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
a
public
bus
or
you're
talking
about
a
chartered
bus?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what...
what
is...
what
is
the
rule
that
you're...
there's
the
restatement
hypotheticals...
restatement
of
torts,
where
there's
the
dead
body,
two
people
are
each
accusing
the
other,
and
add...
i
don't
know
how
the
hypothetical
would
work...
but
add
to
the
mix
that
only
one
could
have
done
it.
can
you
arrest
both?
unknown
speaker
the
model
code
of
pre-arraignment
procedure
just
talks
again
about
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
two
people
and
here
you've
got
three.
what
about
three?
i
was
going
to
ask,
what
about
three?
unknown
speaker
you
can
arrest
all
three?
unknown
speaker
what
about
five?
you're
going
to
arrest
all
five?
even...
i
mean,
you
know,
it
gets
worse
and
worse--
unknown
speaker
--10
percent
chance,
there
are
10
of
them
now--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
chance
that
any
individual
one
did
it
is
10
percent.
that's
still
enough?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
mean
probable.
unknown
speaker
why
do
we
call
it
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
had
to
reduce
it
to
a
percentage
figure,
what
would
you
call
the
percentage
required
for
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
less
than
50,
though,
i
gather?
unknown
speaker
so
that
takes
care
of
the
two
people
in
the
room,
but
when
you
get
down
to
33-1/3
with
three
people?
unknown
speaker
and
with
four
people
it
would
be
25
percent.
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
probably.
[laughter]
you...
you
agree...
you
agree
that
at
some
point
the
probability
is...
when
the
numbers
of
people
present
keep
increasing,
at
some
point
the
probability
is
going
to
be
too
slim?
unknown
speaker
and
one
is--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
accept
justice
stevens'
suggestion
that
your
position
might
differ
from
the
government
here?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
you
do
think
a
conspiracy
can
generally...
can
be
inferred
as
to
all
people
in
these...
in
the
instance
like
this?
unknown
speaker
but
if
one
of
them--
--but
you
didn't
argue
the...
excuse
me...
you
didn't
argue
the
conspiracy
theory
in
the
state
court,
i
don't
think,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
if
you
know
nothing
more
than
what
you
know
here...
i
mean,
i
take
it
that
if...
if
it
were
undisputed
that
one
of
the
three
was
a
hitchhiker,
you...
you
would
not
make
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
hitchhiker?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
wonderful
thing
about
being
on
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
you
can
make
those
assumptions.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
have...
do
you
need
the--
--what
if
the
car...
what
if
the
car
included
a
driver
and
two
hitchhikers
and
the
drugs
were
found
exactly
as
they
were
here,
and
there's
obviously
no
common
enterprise,
would
there
be
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
the
money
really
adds
anything
to
the
analysis,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
unknown
speaker
because
there's
certainly
nothing
illegal
about
carrying
money
in
the
glove
compartment,
where
it
is
illegal
to
carry
drugs
in
the...
behind
the
seat...
the
armrest.
unknown
speaker
but
you--
--the
hitchhiker...
the
hitchhiker
example
poses
a
question
for
the
arresting
officer,
because
does
he
have
to
accept
the
declaration
of
someone
that
i'm
just
a
hitchhiker
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
still
curious
about
the
answer
to
my
question.
assume
the
officer
did
accept
the
truth
of
the
representation
they
were
two...
two
hitchhikers
picked
up
at
different
times,
and
maybe
he
was
following
the
car,
for
instance,
so
he
knew
that
was
true,
and
then
there's
the
driver
and
then
there
are
drugs
in
the
backseat
just
as
there
are
here.
would
there
be
probable
cause
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
the
two
answers
were
yes
and
no.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
i'm
just
assuming
the
only
relevant
facts
are
that
it's
undisputed
they
were
two...
two
unrelated...
they're
three
unrelated
people,
they're
just
entirely
different
backgrounds,
one
doesn't
even
speak
english
and
one
doesn't
speak
spanish,
but
there
are
three
of
them
in
the
car
and
the
drugs
are
found
exactly
under
the
circumstances
here.
what
i'm
trying
to
say...
if
there
were
no
conspiracy
theory,
would
there
be
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
you...
you
have...
you
really
have
to
say
that
based
on
the
dead
victim
hypothetical
that
you
answered
earlier.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
bair.
mr.
srinivasan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
your
brief
reads
to
me...
at
about
page
15...
to
suggest
that
you're
proposing
a
broad
rule
that
probable
cause
exists
to
arrest
all
occupants
of
a
car
anytime
commercial
quantities
of
narcotics
are
found
in
the
passenger
portion
of
the
car.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
it
is
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
say
at
page
15,
beginning
of
the
first
full
paragraph,
for
these
reasons,
the
discovery
of
an
amount
of
narcotics
suitable
for
distribution
in
the
passenger
compartment
supports
an
inference
that
all
of
the
car's
occupants
were
aware
of,
and
hence,
involved
with
the
drugs.
that's
a
sweeping
statement.
unknown
speaker
but
it...
it
might...
wouldn't
different
factors
enter
into
it?
suppose
it's
a
young
child--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
vehicle,
and
it's
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
they're
dropping
the
child
off
at
school
or
something.
are
you
suggesting
there
would
nonetheless
be
this
inference
and
the
child
could
be
hauled
up
and
sent
to
the
juvenile
court?
unknown
speaker
the
only
evidence
that
supports
the
notion
that
some
were
uninvolved
is
that
as
soon
as
one
of
them
confessed,
the
police
immediately
dismissed
the
charge
against
the
other
two,
and
therefore
abandoned
the
notion
that
it
was
a
common
enterprise.
unknown
speaker
you'd
think
if
the...
if
the
backseat
person
or
whoever
it
was
that
confessed
had
confessed
while
the
officer
was
arresting
him,
there
would
have
remained
the
probable
cause
as
to
the
other
two?
could
he
have
said,
i
don't
believe
you,
i'll
take
all
three
of
you
in
anyway?
unknown
speaker
may
i...
may
i
clarify
whether
you
are
indeed
relying
on
common
enterprise?
i
thought
the
view
was
it
may
or
may
not
be
a
common
enterprise,
but
here
is
a
situation,
drugs
equally
accessible,
drugs
accessible
to
any
one
of
the
three.
we
can't
say
whether
all
three
or
which
one,
so
looking
at
the
three,
and
we
say,
well,
it's
not
more...
not
more
likely
the
driver
than
the
front
seat
passenger,
who's
there
behind
the
money,
or
the
backseat
passenger,
because
any
one
of
them
could
have
pulled
down
that
armrest.
i
thought
that
was
your
theory,
not
a...
not
necessarily
a
common
enterprise.
unknown
speaker
do...
do
we
demand
the
same
standard
from
the
arresting
officer
as
we
do
from
the
district
attorney
who
decides
whether
or
not
to
proceed
to
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
do
we
demand
a
higher
standard--
unknown
speaker
--from
either
of
them
in
making
that
assessment?
unknown
speaker
well
isn't...
isn't
that...
that
means
the...
the
probable
cause
standard
is
the
same,
but
the
prosecutor
has
an
obligation
to
try
to
find
out
more
and
get
more
evidence
before
he
goes
forward.
isn't
that
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
the...
but
the
standard...
the
standard
that
determines
the...
the...
the
degree
of
likelihood
of
inference,
that
is
the
same
standard,
whether
we're
talking
about
the
police
officer
or
whether
we're
talking
about
the
district
attorney
later?
unknown
speaker
i...
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying
it...
it
can
get
to
the
jury
with
no
more
than
probable
cause
and
should
not
be
thrown
out
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you're
saying
the
prosecutor
does
not
have
an
obligation
to
refrain
from
bringing
a
prosecution
where
he
plainly
on
the
face
of
it
doesn't
have
enough
evidence
to
convict?
unknown
speaker
to
say
plainly
on
the
face
of
it
is
something
that
a...
a
prosecutor
is
seldom
confronted
with.
i
mean,
you've
got
different
people
telling
different
stories
usually
and
it's
usually
a
question
of
who's
believed.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
assuming
he
has
three
people
in
the
car
and
the
chance
for
each
of
them
is
33-1/3
percent--
unknown
speaker
--and
he
prosecutes
one
of
them
and
he
has
nothing
else.
that's
all
he
has,
three
people
in
the
car,
stuff
in
the
back
seat--
unknown
speaker
--and
he
picks
the
passenger
and
brings
a
prosecution.
the
passenger,
it
could
have
been
me,
it
could
have
been
the
other
two,
33-1/3
percent.
unknown
speaker
and
the
district
court
probably
would
not
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury
if
the
motion
was
made
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution's
case
and
this
was
all
you
had?
unknown
speaker
the
prosecution
should...
the
prosecutor
should
bring
cases
which
clearly
will
not
be
able
to
go
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
may,
may.
unknown
speaker
okay,
that's
not
my
understanding
of
the
prosecutor's--
unknown
speaker
--but
we
have
no
case
saying
that
they
may
not
proceed?
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
said
the
manual
instructed
them
not
to
bring
cases
to
trial.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
readily
at
hand
the...
the
citation
to
the
manual?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the...
the
manual
wouldn't
in
any
way
bind
maryland
authority.
unknown
speaker
if...
if
the
federal
manual
binds
anyone.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
respondent's
position
that
your
position
means
two
innocent
people
may
be
locked
up
in
jail,
because
suppose
pringle
hadn't
fessed
up,
and
he
exercised
his
right
to
remain
silent.
then
you
might
have
a
prolonged
periods,
assuming
they
couldn't
make
bail,
three
people
stuck
in
the
brig
and
two
of
them
are
innocent.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
srinivasan.
ms.
forster,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
forster,
when
you
say
testimony,
you're
not
referring
to
any
scheduled
hearing
or
formal
hearing,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
we
were
considering
this
on
the
basis
offered,
which
is
the
three
people
at
3:30
a.m.
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
in
a
sedan
where
there
were
a
certain
quantity
of
drugs
behind
the
armrest
and
money
in
the
glove
compartment.
unknown
speaker
three
people
in
the
car.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
lot
of
people
wouldn't
refer
to
children
as
being
in
their
twenties,
i
think.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you...
you
make
an
interesting
opening
statement
that
this
is
a
highly
unusual...
we've...
a
lot
of
us
read
a
lot
of
these
cases.
it
seems
to
me
this
happens
all
the
time,
that
drugs
in
the
car,
the
person
says,
it's
not
mine.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
commonplace.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there...
isn't
there
something
more
than
presence
here?
isn't
the
significance...
isn't
the
significant
evidence
of
this
case
something
that
appears
when
you
contrast
it
with
houghton
from
a
couple
of
years
ago?
houghton,
you
had
evidence
that
the
driver
of
the
car
was
a
recreational,
a
personal
drug
user.
we
don't,
i
think,
in
this
society,
at
least
certainly
today,
assume
that
everyone
who
is
in
the
company
of
a
recreational
drug
user
is
also
a
drug
user
or
an
accessory
to
the
first
person's
drug
use.
here,
however,
what
the
police
officer
had
was
evidence,
not
merely
of
the
time,
but
of...
of
three
people
in
a
relatively
small
car
with
commercial
quantities
of
drugs,
an
amount
of
money
that
was
enough
to
suggest
that
drug
dealing
was
going
on,
and
i
think
a...
an
inference
was
possible
that
someone
in
that
car
was
dealing
in
the
drugs.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
different
inference
that
can
be
drawn
about
the
others
here
as
distinct
from
the
inference
in
the
houghton
case
is,
most
drug
dealers
do
not
go
around
in
their
place
of
business,
the
car,
with
people
who
are
totally
innocent
of
drug
activity--
unknown
speaker
--and
isn't
that
the
basic
difference
between
this
and
houghton
and
doesn't
that
inference
support...
amount
to
probably
cause?
unknown
speaker
five...
five
crack
cocaine
hits?
unknown
speaker
but
is--
--how
about
a
big
roll
of
money?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
pointed
it
out,
but
i
think
it...
i
thought,
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
here,
i
thought
that
it
was...
it
was...
the
evidence
was,
regardless
of
how
he
first
described
the
quantity
that
he
saw,
i
thought
the
evidence
came
out
that
there
was
700
and
some
odd
dollars
in
it,
so
i
think
the
judge
could
infer
that
it
was
fairly...
a
fairly
sizable
roll
of
bills.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
in...
and
it
was
in
the
glove
compartment?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
open,
it
wasn't
in
a
wallet
or
something
like
that?
a
roll
of
bills.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
reasonable--
--but
he...
he
must
have
seen
it
in
the
form
of
a...
a
roll
of
bills
or
something,
rather
than,
as
justice
souter
said,
just
not
in
a
wallet.
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
i
mean,
you...
you
don't
have
to
have
been
born
yesterday
to
decide
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
roll
of
bills
exposed
in
your
glove
compartment?
unknown
speaker
you
do?
unknown
speaker
you
better
be
careful
if
you
do.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
at
least
possession.
so
would
you
concede
that
a
crime...
in
the
officer's
presence
there
was
evidence
of
the
commission
of
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
then...
so
the
officer
says,
i
know
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
in
the
whole
world
there
are
only
three
possible
people
who
could
do
it.
what
instruction
would
you
give
to
the
officer
on
the
scene
who
knows
that
a
crime
has
been
committed,
there
are
three
possible
people,
but
he
can't
say
which?
is
it
the
answer
that
he
can
make
no
arrest?
unknown
speaker
what
arrest
can
he
make?
unknown
speaker
and
no
one
else?
unknown
speaker
so
maybe...
definitely
the
driver,
maybe
the
backseat
passenger--
unknown
speaker
--but
not
the
one
who
in
fact--
unknown
speaker
--who
in
fact
committed
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
if
this
were...
if
this
were
a
bus
or
a
tavern
or
a
theater
or
some
of
the
examples,
then
it
certainly
would
unreasonable
to
assume
that
the
front
seat
passenger
could
reach
back
to
the
last
row
of
the
theater.
but
here,
this
was
a
small
car.
it
isn't
hard
for
somebody
in
the
front
seat
to
turn
around
and
push
down
the
armrest.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
because
they...
they
didn't
have
a
buy
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
officer
at
the
scene.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
that
counts
against--
unknown
speaker
--why?
ms.
forster,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
which
ruled
in
your
favor,
says,
during
the
search
officer
snyder
seized
$763
from
the
glove
compartment,
so
they
are...
they
accepted
that
as
a
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
no,
we
take
the
facts
as
the
lower
court
found
them.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it
will
do
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
on
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
but
the...
but
they
nonetheless
say
that
officer
snyder
seized
$763.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
did
you
say
the
driver,
i
mean,
on
your
theory?
i
think
it
would
be
harder
for
the
driver
who's
driving
along
to
put
the
bags
back
in
the
backseat
than
it
would
be
for
the
passengers.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
put
it
there
before,
wouldn't
they
all
know
it
was
there?
unknown
speaker
but
the
driver
consented
to
have
the
car
searched,
so
one
might
think,
my
goodness,
if
he
knew
there
were
drugs
there,
why
did
he
say
yes
when
he
could
have
said
no?
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
like
the...
one
of
the
cases
that
you
relied
on
is
the
di
re
case.
your
answer
to
me
was,
arrest
the
driver.
there,
the
informer
had
fingered
the
driver,
so
the
police
knew
that
they
had
the
right
man
when
they
arrested
the
driver.
here,
it
isn't
at
all
like
di
re
because
the
driver
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
right
person.
unknown
speaker
but
there...
there's...
there's
another
difference.
the
drugs
are
not
locked
up
in
the
trunk.
they
are
at
a
place
where
the
backseat
person
could
push
it
down.
there
wasn't
a
serious
attempt
to
hide
those
drugs
securely.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
if...
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
the...
that
there
probably
was
a
roll
of
bills
visible
in
the
glove
compartment,
mr.
pringle
was
within
easy
reach,
not
even
arm's
reach
of
the
rolled
bills.
unknown
speaker
well,
we...
we
don't
know
that
and
we
don't
know
whether
the
armrest
had
come
down
during
the
time
the
backseat
passenger
was
there.
there
are
lots
of
things
at
a
probable
cause
stage
that
one
does
not
know,
but
the
very
fact...
if...
if
we're
going
to
talk...
if
we're
going
to
find
it
significant
that
something
is
within
reach
of
one
of
the
passengers
or
not,
i
would
have
supposed
that
for
probable
cause
purposes,
the
fact
that
the
money
was
in
reach
was
a
relevant
fact.
unknown
speaker
those
i
just
think
that...
look,
it
just
doesn't
strike
me
as
plausible
that
when
you
have
three
people
in
a
car,
one
of
them
would
stuff
some
drugs
behind
an
armrest
where
they're
very
easy
to
find,
unless
he
thought
the
other
two
were
in
on
it,
i
mean,
unless
you
thought
the
other
two
at
least
didn't
care,
and
if
they
didn't
care
they're
out
there
transporting
the
drugs
with
them.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
how...
i
don't
even
know,
i
mean,
what
i'm
struggling
for
is,
that
seems
like
a
reasonable
inference
so
how...
how
do
i
know,
i
mean,
i'm
making
this
kind
of
inference.
how
do
i
know
whether
i
should
or
not?
unknown
speaker
any
of
the
three,
i
mean,
any
of
them
might,
and
why
would
they?
why...
you'd
have
to
be
crazy
to
be
stuffing
crack
into
a
car
like
that
without
thinking
your
friends
are...
have...
don't
give
a
damn
at
the
very
least--
unknown
speaker
--and
probably
are
in
on
it.
but
certainly,
i
think
that
even
if
they...
he
does
that
in
the
view
of
mr.
pringle,
that...
so
that
mr.
pringle
has
knowledge
that
the
drugs
were
shoved
in
the
armrest...
that
certainly
does
not
also
go
to
the
next
level,
which
is
that
mr.
pringle
possesses
those
drugs.
i
may
see
one...
a
passenger--
--would...
would...
would
the...
the
officer
at
that
point
then
be
able
to
say,
ah,
but,
in
any
case
i
could
arrest
the
other
two
because
they're
harboring
a
felon?
in
other
words,
you
said
that
you
could
maybe
arrest
the
ones
who
sitting
next
to
the...
the
other,
since
the
drugs
are
barely
concealed?
unknown
speaker
here's
what
she's
thinking,
and
there
might
be
a
million
different
crimes.
you
say
to
the
front
seat
passenger,
everything's
the
same,
but
you
say
to
the
front
seat
passenger,
mr.
front
seat
passenger,
did
you
know
that
there
were
drugs
down
there
in
the
armrest?
and
he
says
yes,
and
that's
all
he
says.
i
would
imagine
he
could
be
arrested
then,
couldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
you
couldn't
arrest
him
then?
unknown
speaker
for
transporting
the
drugs
or
helping
to
transport
them
or
being
an
accessory
or
doing
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
doesn't
say
anything.
we
don't
know
anything
about
it.
he
just
says,
sure
i
knew
there
were
drugs
back
there,
that's
all.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but...
but
no,
look,
either
there
is
a
crime
of
being
in
a
car
knowing
that
or
there
isn't.
is
there
or
not?
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so...
so
you'd
have
to
then
make
an
inference
that
a
person
who
says,
yes,
i
knew
the
drugs
where
there,
was
also
going
to
help
later
on.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
that's--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
think
that's
not
reasonable
either?
unknown
speaker
okay.
am
i
right
in
assuming
that
the
other
two
people
in
the
car
didn't
testify
at
the
suppression
hearing?
unknown
speaker
or
at
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
in
separate
little
packets,
right?
unknown
speaker
a
kind
that
people
would
buy
for
a
single
dose?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
and
one
of
their
charges
was
possession,
was
it
not?
i
mean,
we're
not
dealing
only
with
intent
to
distribute
but--
unknown
speaker
--pure
possession
is
what--
unknown
speaker
--well,
to
say
it's
not
inconsistent
with
personal
use,
i
don't
think
gets
your
client
totally
off
the
hook,
because
something
can
be
both
consistent
with
personal
use
and
consistent
with
commercial
intent.
you
know,
something
can...
you
can
infer
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
how
about
the
combination
of
that
with
the...
with
the
$763
roll
in
the
glove
compartment?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
forster.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bair,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
i
do
have
one--
unknown
speaker
--which
is,
i
think
she
said,
look,
there
are
three
possible
inferences.
one
is
that
the
passenger
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
didn't
know
about
it.
two
is,
everybody
knew
about
it
but
that's
all.
and
three,
they
knew
about
it
and
wanted
to
help
sell
the
drugs.
all
right.
now,
she
says,
one
plus
two
are
so
great
that
three
isn't
probable
cause,
but
about,
at
least
two.
unknown
speaker
two...
two
isn't
a
crime,
i
mean,
if
they
just
all
knew
about
it?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
all
three...
it
has
to
be
three
is
great
enough,
so
despite
one
plus
two...
okay.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
