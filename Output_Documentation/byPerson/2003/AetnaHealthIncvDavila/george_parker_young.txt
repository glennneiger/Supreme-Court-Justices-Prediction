mr.
george
parker
young
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
going
to
focus
on
the
narrow
federal
jurisdictional
issue
because
this
case...
these
two
cases
come
to
the
court
based
on
the
federal
removal
doctrine
that
goes
under
the
rubric
of
complete
preemption.
in
each
of
this
court's
cases
on
complete
preemption,
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action,
while
not
citing
to
the
federal
statute,
almost
exactly
duplicated
the
federal
remedy.
here
we
don't
have
that.
here,
what
texas
has
done
is
to
fill
a
vacuum
and
say
we
are
going
to
set
out
a
professional
medical
standard
of
care
when
hmos
make
medical
necessity
decisions.
under
the
hmo's
position,
they
would
be
free
to
say
we're
going
to
use
the
medical
necessity
standard
of
a
witch
doctor
or
whatever
we
decide
it
is
on
today's
basis
without
any
reference
to
objective
medical
standards.
now,
their
medical
necessity
statement
doesn't
say
that,
but
under
their
argument
today,
they
would
be
free
to
do
that.
mr.
george
parker
young
yes,
your
honor.
they...
yes,
justice.
mr.
george
parker
young
if
there
is
time
for
an
appeal
and
if
the
circumstances
would
permit
an
appeal.
an
appeal
is
a
great
thing
in
these
cases.
independent
review
is
a
great
thing--
mr.
george
parker
young
--but,
justice
scalia,
in
these
two
cases,
the
patients
did
what
the
hmo
wanted
and
when,
under
their
argument,
if
the
patients
do
what
the
hmo
wants
and
it
turns
out
those
were
bad
medical
decisions,
there
is
no
remedy.
erisa--
mr.
george
parker
young
--well--
mr.
george
parker
young
--well,
the
truth
is,
your
honor,
that
neither
of
these
claimants
would
have
needed
health
insurance
if
they
had
the
independent
means
to
just
whip
out
gold
card
and
pay
for
the
drug.
mr.
george
parker
young
okay.
mr.
george
parker
young
but
under
this
court's
opinions
previously
under
502,
that
remedy
and
those
kinds
of
relief
are
not
available.
mr.
george
parker
young
it's
true,
your
honor,
that
there
is
this
whole,
but
that
is
not
the
reason
that
we
should
prevail
on
this
narrow
jurisdictional
issue,
because
it's
the
source
of
the
duty.
the
duty
that
arises
here
is
not
based
on
what
is
in
the
plan
document
on
medical
necessity.
it
comes
from
the
external
duty
that
is
imposed
by
texas
statute
to
meet
the
professional
medical
standard
of
care.
mr.
george
parker
young
mr.
chief
justice
they
are
different.
because,
in
this
narrow
issue,
the
complete
preemption
issue,
especially
when
one
looks
at
pilot
life
and
taylor.
those
two
decisions
relied
very
heavily
on
section
301
cases,
the
labor
management
relations
act
cases.
but
if
you
look
at
those
cases
since
pilot
life
and
taylor,
every
time
the
duty
arose
from
something
separate
than
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
every
time
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
no
complete
preemption.
mr.
george
parker
young
yes
your
honor,
that
is
the
way
complete
versus
conflict
preemption
can
work
and
the
way
that
this
circuit
said
it
could
work.
now
i
want
to
be
clear,
we
don't
think
that
we
lose
on
section
515
preemption
either.
and
in
fact
every
time
this
court
has
gone
through
an
erisa
analysis
and
found
section
502
preemption,
every
time,
it
first
goes
to
through
the
section
514
step.
now
that
brings
me
to
something
that
may
be
sensitive
in
light
of
one
of
the
opinions
issued
today.
but
i
want
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
insurance
savings
clause
under
section
514,
because
it's
very
important.
this
court,
in
rush
prudential
said,
that
when
a
state
regulates
medical
necessity,
as
texas
does
here,
that
falls
within
the
insurance
saving
clause.
clearly
this
statute
falls
withing
the
insurance
saving
clause,
especially
as
applied
in
these
two
cases.
mr.
george
parker
young
no,
your
honor,
and
for
this
reason.
while
pilot
life
has
a
statement
in
there,
that--
mr.
george
parker
young
--that
502,
might
trump
and
probably
according
to
pilot
life
could
trump
the
insurance
saving
clause,
the
court
also
found
very
clearly
that
the
insurance
saving
clause
was
not
met
in
that
case.
and
this
court
has
never
faced
what
this
court,
the
majority
in
rush
prudential
called
the
forced
choice,
between
an
insurance
saving
clause
and
section
502.
and
it's
very
important
to
look
at
the
plain
text
of
section
514.
because
section
514
(b)
the
insurance
saving
clause,
says
very
clearly
nothing
in
this
sub-chapter
can
be
construed
to
preempt.
mr.
george
parker
young
your
honor,
the
confusion
arises
because
we
don't
write...
we
don't
write
the
terms
of
the
hmo's
coverage
if
you
will.
they're
the
ones
that
say,
in
determining
what
we
will
pay
for,
if
you
will,
we
are
going
to
make
medical
decisions.
mr.
george
parker
young
they're
the
ones
that
can--
mr.
george
parker
young
--yes.
mr.
george
parker
young
yes,
your
honor,
in
fact,
some
hmo's
in
the
last
two
or
three
years
have
abolished
this
second
guessing
of
the
physician,
this
medical
necessity
step.
mr.
george
parker
young
not
in
texas,
but
they
have
to
be
medical
professionals
according
to
the
texas
statute.
and
the
texas
statute
says,
when
you
make
these
deci--
mr.
george
parker
young
--well,
in
the
case
of
a
nurse,
nursing
judgment.
in
the
case
of
a--
mr.
george
parker
young
--they
do
if
they're
making
a
medical
decision
that
a
doctor
would
make.
under
texas
law
they
do,
and
they're
held
to
that
standard.
and
that's
all
we're
doing
here.
is
we're
holding
them
to
that
medical
standard.
erisa
says
nothing,
justice
scalia,
about
what
standard
the
hmo's
or
deciders
have
to
meet.
mr.
george
parker
young
your
honor.
mr.
george
parker
young
justice
scalia--
mr.
george
parker
young
--justice
scalia
i
think
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
look
at
when
a
payment
decision
could
be
made
and
when
it
is
made
in
these
cases.
you
start
an
episode
of
care
here,
you
finish
it.
the
bill
comes
due
to
make
the
payment.
here
the
hmos
don't
wait
until
the
bill
comes
due
to
make
the
payment
decision.
they
make
the
decision
as
part
of
a
medical
necessity
determination,
in
here,
earlier
in
the
middle,
concurrent
review,
or
prospective
review
is
the
technical
term.
mr.
george
parker
young
it
is
a
decision
that
may--
mr.
george
parker
young
--not
exactly
your
honor,
because
it
is
a
decision
that
could
result
in
not
paying
money,
but
it
is
first
foremost
done
here,
or
here
to
influence
the
medical
decision--
mr.
george
parker
young
--yes,
because
of
pegram,
this
court
in
pegram
said
very
clearly--
mr.
george
parker
young
--your
honor,
in
pegram
this
court
said...
the
majority
said
there's
no
basis
to
distinguish
an
hmo
where
the
decision's
made--
mr.
george
parker
young
--but
here
your
honor,
you're
dealing
with
a
medical
judgment
that's
not
made
at
the
end
when
the
bill
comes
due,
it's
made
early
on
with
the
sole
purpose
of
influencing
the
medical
treatment,
the
course
of
treatment.
if
this
were
only
about
payment--
mr.
george
parker
young
--justice
scalia,
if
that
were
true
then
they
would
make
these
decisions
at
the
end.
because
by
shifting--
mr.
george
parker
young
--well,
the
truth
is
that
making
the
decision
here
shifts
the
risk.
if
it's
made
at
the
back
end
the
risk
is
shifted
to
the
pharmacy,
or
the
doctor,
or
the
hospital.
when
it's
made
here,
it
puts
the
risk
squarely
on
the
patient.
mr.
george
parker
young
according
to
the
documentation
the
hmo
has,
your
honor,
the
two
hmos
require
that
those
decision
be
sought
from
them
before
or
in
the
middle
of
treatment--
mr.
george
parker
young
--it's
not
just
that
they
could
deny
it,
they...
there
could
be
consequences
to
the
provider.
they
could
be
deselected
from
the
network,
they
could
be
told
you're
not
going
to
get
to
see
anymore
of
our
patients.
mr.
george
parker
young
they
do
force
it,
your
honor.
and
that's
the
reality.
mr.
george
parker
young
well
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
here
to
disagree
with
pilot
life.
pilot
life
works
in
the
narrow
circumstances
in
which
it's
been
applied.
mr.
george
parker
young
i
was
afraid
you
might.
i
was
really
afraid
you
might.
mr.
george
parker
young
then
could
we
talk
about
taylor
a
little
more,
because
that's
really
the
complete
branch--
[laughter]
i
guess
i
come
back
to
the
chief
justice's
point
which
is
we
could
have
a
situation
where
pilot
life
preemption
could
occur,
but
the
taylor
holding
is
the
one
we're
most
concerned
about,
and
here
we
are
not
trying
to
duplicate
a
claim
that
would
be
made
under
erisa,
under
an
erisa
duty.
and
that
leads
me
back
to
something
else
that's
come
up.
the
erisa
and
it's
regulations
say
nothing
about
setting
a
medical
standard
of
care,
when
these
medical
judgments
are
made.
that's
an
indication
that
it
was
left
to
the
states,
and
should
be
left
to
the
states.
but
this
court
could
certainly
indicate,
well
this
may
still
be
preempted,
but
it
shouldn't
be
removed
to
federal
court,
under
complete
preemption
doctrines.
mr.
george
parker
young
well,
that
is
the
very
narrow
issue
that
in
fact
certiorari
was
granted
on.
and
it
is
an
issue
that
this
court
last
ruled
on
in
the
anderson
case
last
term,
and
that
case
is
illustrative
of
why
complete
preemption
shouldn't
apply
here.
there
the
majority
found
that
the
claim,
while
not
citing
to
federal
usury
law
duplicated
precisely
and
exactly
federal
usury
law.
and
it
was
in
essence,
a
federal
usury
claim.
here
our
claim
is
not
one
for
benefits.
it
couldn't
be,
there's
no
claim
for
benefits
to
be
made.
but
more
importantly
we
are
not
relying
on
a
term--
mr.
george
parker
young
--in
fact
your
honor,
you
could
have
a
situation
where
the
medical
necessity
decision
is
made
prospectively
or
concurrently
and
that's
not
a
payment
denial,
in
fact
that's
what
we
have
in
most
circumstances
of
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
george
parker
young
really
your
honor,
in
truth
these
decisions
are
never
expressed
by
the
utilization
nurse
at
the
hospital
as
a
payment
issue.
she
says
you've
got
to
go
home
now.
mr.
george
parker
young
yes,
your
honor.
here--
mr.
george
parker
young
--but
here
your
honor,
you
could
have
a
payment
determination
that
complied
completely
with
their
internal
document...
documents.
their
definition
of
medical
necessity,
what
they
say
they
will
or
won't
do.
and
still
violate
the
texas
standard
for
medical
judgments
and
that's
the
problem.
mr.
george
parker
young
well--
mr.
george
parker
young
--well...
your
honor,
we're
confusing
remedies,
and
duties.
the
texas
duty
is
found
no
where
in
erisa.
mr.
george
parker
young
it
would
not--
mr.
george
parker
young
--it
would
be
an
undisputed
fact.
it
would
be
for
example
in
these
two
cases.
it's
undisputed
that
ruby
calad
could
get
unlimited
days
in
the
hospital.
the
only
issue
is
the
medical
judgment
that
she
had
to
go
home.
same
with
mr.
davila.
the
medical
judgment
was
that
he
would
not
get
the
vioxx;
he
would
get
the
cheaper
generic
drug.
and--
mr.
george
parker
young
--but
that
doesn't...
that's--
mr.
george
parker
young
--it's
an
affirmative
defense
they
may
be
able
to
come
in
with.
it's
not
a
prerequisite
to
my
case.
cigna
admits
it
is
free.
mr.
george
parker
young
but
that's
very
important
especially
your
honor
when
we're
talking
about
a
complete
preemption
issue.
is
the
federal
statute
a
prerequisite
to
my
claim?
all
i
have
to
prove
and
show
your
honor,
is
a
medical
judgment
was
exercised
by
a
nurse,
at
cigna,
or
a
physician
or
medical
director
at
aetna,
and
that
they
violated
the
texas
standard
for
those
kinds
of
decisions.
mr.
george
parker
young
no
i'm
not
saying
that
your
honor,
but
the
gravamen
of
my
case
for
purposes
of
looking
at
complete
preemption,
the
issue
you
were
concerned
about
in
anderson,
is
what
are
the
elements
of
my
claim.
they
do
not
duplicate
an
erisa
claim,
they
don't
even
duplicate
an
erisa
duty.
now
it
may
be
at
the
end
of
the
day
section
514
kicks
in.
we
don't
think
it
does
for
a
lot
of
reasons,
most
importantly
the
insurance
saving
clause.
which
clearly
the
texas--
mr.
george
parker
young
--no
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
while
it
was
not
a
feature
argument
with
a
heading
in
our
briefing,
we
clearly
pointed
out
to
the
fifth
circuit
the
moran
decision
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
that
the
moran
decision
relied
on
the
insurance
saving
clause.
then
after
oral
argument--
mr.
george
parker
young
--yes
it's
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
and
then
your
honor,
in...
after
this
court
decided
rush
prudential
which
occurred
after
oral
argument
in
the
fifth
circuit,
both
sides
submitted
extensive
letter
briefs.
and
those
are
documents,
18
through
20
in
the
fifth
circuit
record
that
was
recently
transmitted
to
this
court,
where
both
sides
talked
about
what
is
the
impact
of
rush
prudential
in
terms
of
the
insurance
savings
clause.
but
more
important...
thank
you.
mr.
george
parker
young
mr.
mattax
we'll
hear
from
you.
