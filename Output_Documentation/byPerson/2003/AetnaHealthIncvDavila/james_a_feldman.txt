mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
as
justice
gin...
as
justice
ginsberg
said,
our
position,
i
think,
is
in
footnote
13
of
our
brief,
and
it's
a
position
the
department
of
labor
has
taken
in
cases
and
number--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
it's...
it
really
isn't
the
issue
in
this
case
because
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
claims
are
preempted
by
502(a)(1)(b).
but,
in
a
case
where
there
was
a
fiduciary
involved,
in
the
days
of
the
divided
bench,
when
a
beneficiary
sued
a
fiduciary,
they
weren't...
they
couldn't...
weren't
able
to
get
make
whole
relief.
and
the...
by
the
same--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--you
get...
there
were...
there
are
cases
that
i...
i
don't
want
to
get
too
deeply
into
502(a)(3)(b),
because
i
don't
think
it's
what's
at
issue
in
this
case.
but
there
are
cases
in
which,
for
example,
a
trustee
doesn't
buy
an
insurance
policy
that
they're
supposed
to
buy
and
then
the
beneficiary
can
get,
as
relief,
whatever
the
value
of
that
insurance
policy
would
have
been
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
502(a)(3)...
i
mean,
erisa
does
head
up
a
beneficiary
trustee...
a
beneficiary
fiduciary
type
of
relationship
that
does
have
analogies
in
traditional
equity.
but
in
any
event--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
it
would,
because
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
there
was
a
fiduciary
involved
in
this
case.
neither
of
the
claimants
in
this
case,
neither
they...
the
people
who
denied
the
benefits
on
behalf
of
the
plans
may
or
may
not
have
been
fiduciaries.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
they...
well,
whether
the...
you
know,
i
frankly
haven't
thought
about
whether
the
plan
itself
would
be
a
fiduciary.
ordinarily,
the
way
the
erisa
scheme
is
supposed
to
work
is,
if
you
have
a
denial
of
benefit,
you
have
a
right
to
appeal
to
an
appropriate
named
fiduciary,
and
at
that
stage,
departmental
regulations
give
you
kind
of
very
substantial
procedural
rights
to
make
sure
that
benefits
determination
gets
made
very
quickly
and
appropriately,
in
light
of
the
medical
exigencies
of
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you.
our
argument
is
that
the
texas
law
provides
an
additional
remedy
to
that
in
section
502(a)(1)(b),
because
respondents'
right
to
recover
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
in
this
case
depends
on
their
showing
that
they
had
a
right
to
the
benefits
under
the
plan...
under
the
terms
of
their
plan.
the
state
law
provides
that
plaintiffs
must
prove
that
the
plan's
failure
to
exercise
what
the
state
law
says
is
due
care,
that
their
failure
to
exercise
due
care
is
the
proximate
cause
of
the
plaintiff's
injury.
the
only
way
that
that
could
be
true
is
if
the
plan
didn't
pay
benefits
that
it
was
obligated
to
pay
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
the
plan--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i...
in
the
first
place,
she
was
told
before...
i
think
the
complaint
says
she
was
told
before
she
entered
the
hospital
that
she
would
have
only
one
day
in
the
hospital.
but
in
addition--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
and
i
would
just
say
there's
about
three
backstops
there.
one
is
department
of
labor
regulations
say
you
have
to
make
determ...
these
determinations
as
soon
as
possible
considering
the
medical
exigencies
of
the
case
and
she
didn't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--these
claims
can
be
made
orally,
again,
if
the
exigencies
require,
and
she
could...
she
didn't
try...
as
far
as
we
know,
no
one
made
a
phone
call
to
the
insurer
and
said
can
i
get
the
extra
benefits;
she
needs
it.
we
don't
know
what
the
results
of
that
would
have
been.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
then--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would
have
been
itself
a
denial
of
their
obligations
under
the
department's
claim
processing...
claims
processing
procedures.
but
let
me
say
there's
also--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
but
there
are
other
backstops
for
her
getting
the
extra
day
in
the
hospital.
she
is,
at
that
point,
in
the
same
position
as
anyone
else
who
can't
pay
for
another
day
in
the
hospital
but
they
need
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
up
to
her
doctor,
with
whom
she
has
a
doctor
patient
relationship
that's
a
consensual
relationship
for
providing
medical
treatment.
it's
up
to
her
doctor
to
decide
when
she
should
be
discharged
from
the
hospital
and
when
she
shouldn't.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yeah,
but
the
state
of
texas
has
many
remedies
to
make
sure
the
hospitals
don't
discharge
people
who
need
an
extra
day
in
the
hospital
and
medical
ethics
provides
additional
reasons
why
doctors
have...
cannot
discharge
patients
who
need
an
extra
day
in
the
hospital.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there
was...
he
took
the
drug,
i
think
that...
the
record
actually
shows,
i
think,
that
he
took
the
drug
for
several
weeks
before
he
had...
before
he
had
the
problem
with
it.
he
could
have
been
pursuing
the
plan
remedies
all
throughout
that.
in
addition,
texas
law,
like
the
law
of
44
other
states,
provides
for
an
independent
review
mechanism
which
is
also
designed
to
decide
at
the
front
end
whether...
what
benefits
you're
entitled
to.
and
under
that
mechanism
he
could
have
sought
independent
review
from
somebody
who's
independent
of
the
plan,
not
subject
to
any
bad
incentives
he
might
have
thought
the
plan
might
have,
to
make
an
accurate
determination
of
what
is...
what
he's
entitled
to
and
what
he's
not
entitled
to.
it's...
there
are...
there
are
a
number
of
remedies
that
people
can...
that
people
have
in
order
to
make
sure
they
stay
in
the
hospital.
what
the
erisa
plan
is
doing
here
is
simply
making
a
benefits
determination.
it's
a
pure
determination
under
erisa
and
it's
not
based
on
the
formation
of
a
doctor
patient
relationship
which
the
patient
has
with
their
doctor.
it's
based
on
their
determinations
under
erisa,
under
section
502(a)(1)(a)...
section
502
of
erisa,
congress
drew
a
very
careful
balance
between
the
needs
for
a
prompt
and
quick
claims
processing
procedure
that
would
be
effective
and
to
decide
in
advance
whether
you
get
benefits
and
the
public
interest
in
encouraging
the
formation
of
employee
benefits
plans
and
encouraging
the
provision
of
benefits
under
those
plans.
to
allow
states
to
essentially
say,
as
the
state
has
said
here,
well,
we're
going
to
provide
an
additional
remedy
that
congress
rejected
when
it
drew
that
careful
balance,
would
be
an...
as
the
court
said
in
pilot
life,
to
completely
undermine
congress's
decisions
about
how
this
system
should
be
structured.
the
state
has
ample
authority
to
address
medical
malpractice
in
the
state
in
between...
between
doctors
and
patients
where
that
doc...
consensual
doctor
patient
relationship
has
been
formed.
what
it
doesn't
have
authority
to
do
is
to
take
its...
that
medical
malpractice
law
and
extend
it,
not
to
the
normal
doctor
patient
situation,
but
to
a
situation
that
is
governed
by
federal
law
under
section
502
and
by
the
remedies
that
congress
chose
where
appropriate.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there's...
i
don't
think
there's
any
indication
of
whether
they
did
or
not.
and,
in
fact,
i
don't...
i
think
that
under
the
co-payment
of
the
aetna
plan,
vioxx
wouldn't
have
been
terribly
expensive
because
aetna
would
have
picked
up
some
of
tab
for
that.
but
all
of
those
would
be
facts
relating
what's
in
the
plan.
i
think
they
all
just
point
out
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
what
the
plan
provided
and
did
the
plaintiffs
get
what
the
plan
provided.
and
this
court
decided,
in
pilot
life
and
in
metropolitan
life
against
taylor,
and
it
reaffirmed
two
terms
ago
in
the
rush
prudential
case,
that
those
questions
are
erisa
questions
and
congress
decided
that...
set
in
place
a
set
of
remedies
that
allow
for
very
substantial
rights
to
determine
whether
you're
entitled
to
the
benefit,
but
limited
your
rights
to
sue
for
pun...
for
compensatory
and
especially
punitive
damages
afterwards,
because
there's
also,
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance,
the
need
to
encourage
employers
to
provide
healthcare
and
to
create
erisa
plans.
and,
as
i
said,
to
allow
states
to
interfere
in
that
balance
and,
as
texas
has
done
here,
to
create
a
cause
of
action
which
is
essentially
for
the
denial
of
a
plan
benefit,
and
that's
something
that
the
plaintiffs,
i
think,
have
to
prove
in
order
to
prevail,
is
to
directly
interfere
with
that
decision
of
congress.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
those
cases
involved
disability
insurance,
but
they
were...
they
had
a
medical
element
in
those...
in
those
decisions.
that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--thank
you.
