pretty
big
point
to
be
in
a
footnote.
justice
antonin
scalia
lest
we
be
too
sanguine
about
the
application
of
that
law
in
this
context,
i
don't
know
any
equitable
cases
that
would
consider
make
whole
relief
to
be
giving...
where
what
is
at
issue
is
merely
the
payment...
the
failure
to
pay
money,
refusal
to
pay
money.
make
whole
relief
would
give
you
what
you
would
have
done
with
that
money
if
you
had
gotten
it.
that's
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
but
all
that's
going
on
here
is
that
the
claimant
was
perfectly
able
to
buy
vioxx
with
his
own
money,
but
when
it
was
said
by
the
insurer
that
they
wouldn't
pay
for
vioxx,
the
claimant
went
and...
went
with
the
drug
that
was
covered.
i
have
serious
doubts
whether
we
can
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that
even
if
we
deny
relief
here
it'll
all
be
okay
because
under
traditional
equity
law,
in
a
situation
like
that,
you
can...
you
can
get
whatever
you
would
have
done
had
you
been
given
the
money.
i
don't
know
that
that
principle
washes.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
whether
these
individuals
did
not
have
the
funds
to
stay
in
the
hospital
another
day
or
to
buy
vioxx?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
free
to
do
it?
they
would
be
subject
to...
to
an
appeal
and
an
appeal
to
an
independent
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
they
didn't
pay
up,
they
would
be...
would
be
liable
for
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
what
i'm...
i'm
just
speaking
to
your
point
of
whether
they're
scott
free
to
do
whatever
they
want.
they
surely
aren't,
you
know.
even
if
the
appeal
comes
afterwards,
the
claimant
can
get
the
money
that's
owed
and
the
relief
provided
by
502(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
do
what
the
hmo...
all
the
hmo
said
is,
look,
under
the
plan,
as
we
understand
it
and
as
we
judge
medical
necessity,
we
don't
have
to
pay
for
vioxx.
now,
if
you
want
to
have
vioxx,
buy
it
yourself,
and
i
gather
there
was
some
co-payment
that
would
have
been
given,
and
if
their
doctor
thought
that
vioxx
was
really
essential,
surely
the
doctor
would
have
abided,
you
know,
pony
up
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
to
say
that
the
plan
condemned
them
to
not
using
vioxx
is
simply
not
true.
all
you're
talking
about
here
is
money.
the
claimant
didn't
want
to
lay
out
the
additional
money
for
the
vioxx.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
let's...
but
suppose
they
don't,
do
the
agents
of
the
insurers
who
make
these
determinations
do
they
have
to
be
admitted
to
the
practice
of
medicine
in
texas?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
a
medical
professional?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't
have
to
be
doctors?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
talk
about
the
standard
of
care,
but
they're
not
giving
care.
they're
giving
out
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
giving
care
at
all,
the
caregiver
was
the
individual's
doctor
who
said
stay
in
another
day
or
take
vioxx.
they
care...
all
this
company
was
doing
was
looking
at
the
contract,
do
we
owe
any
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
giving
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that?
i
don't
think
aetna
cares
whether
this
individual
took
vioxx,
or
whether
this
patient
stayed
in
the
hospital
for
another
day.
i
don't
think
aetna
cared
a
bit.
all
aetna
cared
about
was
whether
it
had
to
pay
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
important
to
the
patient
to
know.
because
the
patient
when...
when
the
patient
finds
out
that
if
you
take
vioxx,
you'll
have
to
pay
for
it
yourself,
the
patient
can
then
ask
the
doctor,
look
doc,
is
it
really
important
that
i
take
vioxx
or
is
this
other
stuff
in
your
judgment
as
the
treating
physician,
is
this
other
stuff
good
or
not...
good
enough.
it
seems
to
me
you
want
that
decision
to
be
made
early.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
indeed.
that's
why
it's
preempted.
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
described
it
very
clearly.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
statute
says
this,
it
says
that
it
shall
be
a
defense
to
any
action
that
one...
neither
the
health
insurance
carrier
is...
didn't
control
the
health
care
treatment
decision.
which
it
wasn't
here.
and
two,
the
health
care
insurance
carrier
did
not
deny
or
delay
payment
for
any
treatment
prescribed,
or
recommended
by
a
provider.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
clearly
a
condition
of
recovery
that
you
show
that
they
were
in
violation
of
the
erisa
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh
i
see.
well
that's
a
matter
of
who
has
to
prove
it.
i
mean
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
long
as
you
frame
it
as
an
affirmative
defense,
rather
as
part
of
the
cause
of
action,
you
can
avoid
preemption?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
also
a
defense
that
i
did
not
fail
to
make
any
delay,
i
did
not
delay
or
fail
to
make
any
payment
due.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
make
a
medical
judgment
when
you
refuse
to
make
a
payment.
you're
deciding
it's
not
medically
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
you're
not.
you're
saying
even
if
it's
not
according
to
your
standard
of
care,
if
it
is
not
due
under
the
plan
you're
not
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
said
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
an
hmo,
it's
also
a
health
insurance
carrier.
here,
aetna.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
don't
think...
well
never
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
estrada,
you
can
address
what
you
would
like
but
there
are
three
points
that
have
come
up
during
the
respondent's
presentation
that
i'd
be
interested
with
a
response
to.
number
one,
is
it
true
that
the
people
who
make
the
decisions
for
your
client
must
be
medical
doctors
in
texas?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
other
two
points
are,
what
is
your
response
to
the
point
that
the
plan
is
not
liable
under
texas
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
the
insurance
company
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
so
you
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--lastly.
is
there
anything
to
the
notion
that
there
is
no
preemption
when
the
interference
with
the
plan,
if
there
is
any,
only
comes
by
way
of
an
affirmative
defense.
