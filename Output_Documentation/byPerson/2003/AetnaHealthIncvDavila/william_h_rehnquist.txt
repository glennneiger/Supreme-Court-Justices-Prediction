the
aetna
health
care
v.
davila
and
cigna
healthcare
v.
calad.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
59a
of
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
young,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
different
is
the
question
of
the
merits
here,
whether
you
should
prevail
and
the
question
of
complete
preemption
which
is
raised
in
the
removal
issue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
view
is
you
could
prevail
on
the
propriety
of
removal,
because
there's
not
complete
preemption,
and
yet
go
back
and
lose
on
the
issue
of
whether
your
claim
is
in
fact
preempted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's
contrary
to
pilot
life,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
very
definite
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
a
decision
to
pay
money?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
not
to
pay
money?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
how
would
that
advance
the
general
law
at
all?
i
mean,
if
the
merits
are
decided
against
you,
you
know,
i
don't
think
we
took
this
case
to
decide
some
question
of
removal
jurisdiction,
but
i...
perhaps
my
colleagues
don't
agree
with
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
young.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
just...
even
at
the
early
stage,
it's
simply
a
statement,
we
will
not
pay
for
it.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
patient
can't
do
it
other
ways.
it
just
means
that
this
particular
program
won't
pay
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
isn't
it
more
a
question
of
medical
necessity.
that
is
the
plan
says,
all
right,
we'll
cover
it
in
case
of
medical
necessity,
and
the
plan
says
we
don't
think
there's
medical
necessity
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
it's
certainly
it's
by
the
plan.
i
mean
the
fact
that
an
agent
makes
it
rather
than
the
plan
doesn't
make
any
difference.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
how
much
does
that
advance
the
argument.
i
mean
it's
still
a
decision
we
won't
pay
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
mattax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
estrada,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
