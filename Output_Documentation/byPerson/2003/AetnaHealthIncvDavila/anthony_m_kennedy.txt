i
don't
want
you
to
go
too
long
on
point
two
without
getting
back
to
point
one,
but
as
long
as
we're
here,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
dichotomy,
the
duality
you
propose
between
a
decision
about
benefits
and
medical
treatment
might,
at
the
edges,
blur
into
each
other.
if
i
say,
as
aetna
or
cigna,
you're
not
authorized
to
seek
this
treatment
and
the
person
has
no
other
funds,
basically,
that
is
a
treatment
decision,
in
a
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
my
point
was,
at
some
time,
and
even
in
these
cases,
there...
that
there
was
a
component
of
what
we
might
call
medical
judgment
involved.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
like
to
hear
your
arguments
on
the
preemption
issue.
