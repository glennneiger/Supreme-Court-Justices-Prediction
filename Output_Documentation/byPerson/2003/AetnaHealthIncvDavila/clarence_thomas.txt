the
first
opinions
i
have
to
announce
are
aetna
health,
inc.
versus
davila,
no.
02-1845
and
cigna
healthcare
of
texas,
inc.
versus
calad,
no.
03-83.
these
consolidated
cases
come
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
respondents
are
participants
in
a
beneficiary
in
two
separate
erisa-regulated
employee
health
plans
which
are
administered
in
part
by
petitioners.
respondents
allegedly
suffered
injuries
caused
by
petitioner’s
denials
of
coverage
for
certain
medical
treatments.
respondents
then
sued
petitioners
in
state
court
under
the
texas
healthcare
liability
act.
the
act
refer
to
claiming
that
the
denials
of
coverage
violated
petitioner’s
duty
under
the
act
to
exercise
ordinary
care.
petitioners
removed
the
cases
to
federal
district
court
arguing
that
the
causes
of
action
were
completely
preempted
by
the
civil
enforcement
provision
found
at
section
502(a)
of
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974,
erisa.
although
the
district
courts
agreed
with
petitioners,
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
determined
that
respondents
brought
tort
claims
not
breach
of
contract
claims,
sought
remedies
other
than
the
payment
of
benefits,
and
sued
for
violation
of
a
legal
duty
supposedly
independent
of
those
created
by
erisa
or
the
terms
of
the
benefit
plans.
based
on
these
factors,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
respondents’
causes
of
action
did
not
duplicate
any
cause
of
action
created
by
erisa
section
502(a),
and
hence
the
causes
of
action
were
not
completely
preempted.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
a
state
cause
of
action
is
completely
preempted
and
hence,
removable
when
the
cause
of
action
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
erisa
civil
enforcement
provision.
respondents’
causes
of
action
fall
within
the
scope
of
erisa
502(a)(1)(b)
which
provides
a
remedy
for
a
wrongful
denial
of
benefit.
the
only
injuries
of
which
respondents’
complain
are
petitioners’
refusal
to
pay
for
medical
treatment
allegedly
covered
under
the
terms
of
erisa-regulated
employee
benefit
plans.
respondents
could
have,
upon
learning
of
the
denial
of
coverage,
brought
an
action
under
erisa
502(a)(1)(b).
nor
is
an
independent
legal
duty
implicated
here.
the
act
expressly
limits
its
scope
to
wrongful
coverage
decision.
thus,
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
the
plans
is
essential
to
respondents’
claims
and
any
duties
arising
from
the
act
are
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
rights
and
responsibilities
set
forth
by
erisa
and
the
plan
terms.
under
these
circumstances,
the
state
causes
of
actions
are
deplicative
of
erisa
502(a)(1)(b)
and
are
hence,
completely
preempted.
neither
the
insurance
savings
clause
found
in
erisa
514(b)(2)(a),
nor
this
court’s
opinion
in
pegram
versus
herdrich
alter
this
conclusion.
the
insurance
savings
clause
is
not
implicated
where
a
state
law
creates
a
cause
of
action
that
duplicates
or
supplements
the
erisa
civil
enforcement
provision.
pegram
is
implicated
only
where
a
person
is
acting
as
a
treating
position
and
as
a
benefit’s
administrator
simultaneously.
the
mere
fact
that
an
eligibility
determination
is
infused
with
medical
judgment
does
not
render
anything
other
than
an
ordinary
eligibility
determination.
thus,
petitioners
are
not
respondents'
treating
positions
or
employers
are
respondents'
treating
position,
pegram
is
not
relevant
here.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined.
