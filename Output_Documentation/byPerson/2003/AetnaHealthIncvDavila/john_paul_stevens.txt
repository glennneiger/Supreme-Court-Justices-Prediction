john
paul

mr.
estrada,
can
i
just
raise
a
question?
i'm
sure
you'll
cover
it
in
the
argument
and
i
want
to
get
it
on
the
table.
on
your
first
point,
that
our
prior
cases
have
said
that
502
is
the
exclusive
remedy
for
actions
to
acquire
benefits,
is
there
a
distinction?
some
of
your
opponents
argued
between
denials
based
on
the
terms
of
the
plan,
that
this
just
doesn't
qualify
for
some
reason,
on
the
one
hand,
that
you
just
should
get
the
answer
out
of
the
plan,
and
denials
based
on
a
discretionary
decision
as
to
whether
the
medical
treatment
was
appropriate
or
not,
which
would
require
the
exercise
of
some
kind
of
professional
judgment.
the
nurse
might
think
he
doesn't
need
an
extra
day
in
the
hospital
or
something
like
that.
is
that
a
valid
distinction
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
of
course
they
could,
but
the
fact
that
if
we
held
there
was
no
preemption,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
they
would
win
on
the
merits.
i
mean,
you
are...
your
drug
formulary
may
be
absolutely
defensible,
even
though
it
could
be
tested
in
a
state
court
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
let
me
just
focus
on
the
case
involving
the
woman
who
may
have
needed
a
second
day
in
the
hospital.
is
it
correct
that
they...
an
agent
of
the
hmo
had
discretion
to
grant
that
second
day
if
the
nurse
thought
it
was
really
medically
required?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
decision
as
to
whether
she
would
have
the
second
day
in
the
hospital
would
depend
on
a
medical
judgment
made
by
an
agent
of
the
plan.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
coverage
is
if
it's
medically
needed,
it
would...
she
would
get
the
second
day.
but
whether
or
not
it's
covered
then
turns
on
a
medical
judgment,
does
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
is
not
correct,
to
make
the
coverage
decision,
one
has
to
make
a
medical
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
was
focusing
on
the
cigna
case,
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
it's
a
little
clearer
there
that
there
would
be
a
medical
judgment
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
the
situation
in
the
hospital
case,
there
was
no
time
to
get
relief.
how
could
they...
how
could
they
get
relief
from
the
denial
of
the
extra
day
in
the
hospital
between
midnight
and
the
next
morning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
it
was
medically
necessary
to
stay
an
extra
day.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
does
that
mean
in
the
hospital
setting?
and
what...
was
she
going
to
file
a
complaint
with
the
department
of
labor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
let's
assume
the
case...
because
your
preemption
item
would
cover
even
the
most
extreme
case.
assume
the
case
in
which
the
patient
and
the
doctor
both
called
the
agency
and
appealed
and
they
said
we're
too
busy,
we
can't
handle
it
and
it
later
determines
they
were...
did
not
exercise
due
care.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
are
you
preempting
the
state
providing
a
remedy
for
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
have
been
a
denial,
but
it
wouldn't
have
given
her
the
extra
day
in
the
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
question
we
really
are
facing
is
whether
the
state
of
texas
is
denied
the
authority
to
provide
a
remedy
in
that
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that
correct
that
those
cases
did
not
involve
treatment
decisions,
pilot
life
and
metropolitan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
could
you
ever
recover
under
the
texas
statute
without
proving
that
you
were
entitled
to
have
the
benefit
paid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wouldn't
be
phrased
in
those
terms.
wouldn't
it
be
part
of...
wouldn't
it
be
a
necessary
element
of
your
claim,
that
part
of
what
you're...
that
you
did
have
an
entitlement
to
have
that
benefit
paid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
you
to
prevail
in
texas,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
they
had
a
duty
to
pay
for...
to
provide
him
with
the
payment
for
vioxx.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
is
it
not
true
that
in
order
to
recover
under
the
texas
statute,
not
only
do
you
have
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
duty
to
use
the
due
care
and
so
forth.
but
you
also
have
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
plan?
