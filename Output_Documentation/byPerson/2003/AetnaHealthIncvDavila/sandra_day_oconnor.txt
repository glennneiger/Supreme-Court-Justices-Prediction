now
just
to
be
clear,
mr.
estrada,
you
take
the
position
that
erisa
section
502(a)
completely
preempts
the
texas
scheme
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
don't
have
before
us
any
conflict
preemption
under
section
514?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
a
little...
it's
a
little
like...
if
you're
telling
doctors
what's
medically
necessary
under
the
plan,
it's
in
effect
maybe
defining
the
basic
standards
of
medical
care,
in
a
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
you
are
correct
that
section
502(a)
preempts,
is
it
possible
that
under
erisa
502(a)(3),
that
the
plaintiffs
might
recover
some
money,
for
example,
for
pain
and
suffering
and
things
like
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
feldman,
will
you
tell
us
what
the
government
thinks
can
be
recovered
under
502(a)(3)
in
the
way
of
damages
or
other
recovery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
really
thought
the
train
left
the
station
in
pilot
life.
i
guess
you
don't
agree
with
pilot
life.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
i
thought
that
this
was
that
circumstance
of
benefits.
