mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
these
consolidated
cases
is
whether
participants
and
beneficiaries
of
erisa
plans
may
seek
consequential
and
punitive
damages
in
state
court
under
state
tort
law
for
the
allegedly
wrongful
denial
of
erisa
health
care
benefits.
the
fifth
circuit
answered
that
question
yes,
reasoning
that
completely...
that
the
complete
preemption
under
the
federal
statute
applies
to
contract
claims
that
essentially
duplicate
what's
available
under
section
502
of
the
federal
statute,
but
not
to
tort
claims,
which
give
supplemental
remedy
for
consequential
and
punitive
damages.
for
two
principal
reasons,
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
first,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
all
challenges
to
the
propriety
of
benefit
determination,
whether
couched
in
tort
or
in
contract,
are
completely
preempted
by
section
502
and
therefore
are
removable
and
governed
solely
by
federal
law.
second,
the
fact
that
the
welfare
plans
at
issue
in
these
cases
provide
benefits
for
medical
care,
as
opposed
to
disability,
death,
or
some
other
welfare
benefit,
does
not
alter
the
analysis
under
the
federal
statute
or
give
the
states
any
more
power
to
supplement
the
remedies
that
congress
included
in
section
502.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is...
that
is
right,
justice
o'connor.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
turning
to
section
502(a)
and
to
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
and
let
me
turn
to
that...
that
was
my
second
point,
but
i'll
turn
to
it
now.
the
use
of
medical
criteria,
whether
discretionary
or
not,
is
inherent
in
health
care
coverage
and
usually
is
also
inherent
in...
in
disability
coverage.
yet,
last
term,
in
the
black
&
decker
case,
this
court
held
that
the...
that
a
claimant's
treating
doctor
gets
no
special
deference
in
a
claim
for
the
benefits
where
the
issue
is
whether
the
medical
factors
warrant
a
disability
finding.
under
the
theory
being
advanced
by
texas
and
the
respondents
in
this
case,
however,
black
&
decker
needn't,
and
maybe
even
couldn't,
be
an
erisa
case
because
a
state
of
the
union
could
regulate
the
medical
component
of
the
disability
finding
under
the
guise
of
regulating
the
practice
of
medicine
and
could
give
tort
remedies
and
consequential
and
punitive
damages
whenever
the
plan
disagreed
with
the...
with
the
claimant's
doctor.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
didn't
understand
the
claim
as
to
the
aetna
case
necessarily
to
be
a
challenge
to
the
promulgation
of
the
formulary,
which
is
expressly
authorized
by
the
prescription
drug
writer
of
the
plan.
i
understood
the
challenge
to
be
to
a
particular
benefits
decision
that
was
made
when
aetna,
the
insurer
and
plan
administrator,
concluded
that
the
benefit
was
not
covered
in
the
circumstances
because
of
the
step
therapy
requirement.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
it
is
not,
justice
kennedy.
the
purpose
of
employee
benefits
plan...
benefit
plans
is
to
cover
some
things
for
the
employees.
if
the
plans
in
these
cases
said
that
the
benefit
was
$100
for
each
hospital
stay
or
that
you
got
$20
for
your
drugs,
whatever
they
may
be,
no
one
would
deny
that
that
was
a...
that
that
was
a
benefit
determination.
as
i
said
earlier,
with
respect
to
medical
care,
it
has
always
been
the
case
that
in
determining
the
scope
of
coverage,
medical
factors
have
always
been
used
and
that
factor
is
imbedded
into
the
background
understandings
of
how
this
very
statute
works.
for
example,
section
503
of
the
statute
allows
the
department
of
labor
to
promulgate
regulations
to
deal
with
how
claims
are
made
and
the
like.
one
of
those
regulations
by...
by
the
department
of
labor
expressly
contemplates
that
if
a
claimant
has
a
proposed
treatment
turned
down,
he
may
appeal
to
a
named
fiduciary
who
is
required,
under
the
dol
regs,
to
consult
with
an...
with
an
appropriate
medical
hair...
care
professional
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
undisputed,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
that
our
position
is
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
claimant
who
has
a
doctor
patient
relationship
with
his
doctor
and
a
claimant
who
had
an
insuretal
coverage
relation
with
his
insurer.
just
to
put
it
into
context
of
legal
practice,
if
the
person
reading
the
plan
documents
and
denying
a
claim...
the
claim,
excuse
me,
uses
medical
training
to
conclude
that
the
plan
documents
did
not
cover
a
treatment,
i
think
few
people
would
think
that
that
entitled
the
claimant
to
sue
the
person
who
turned
it
down
for
legal
malpractice.
and
the
same
is
basically
true
here,
too,
because
the
plan's...
the
plan's
role,
as
is
very
clear
in
the
express,
for
example,
in
the...
in
the
text
of
the
monitronics
opinion,
is
to
deal
with
the
question,
shall
we
pay
or
shall
we
not
pay.
and
that's
actually
precisely
what
texas
has
targeted
here.
if
i
could
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
petition
appendix
in
the
aetna
case,
02-1885,
the
relevant
parts
of
the
texas
statute
are
set
forth
in
page
59a
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--of
the
aetna
petition
appendix,
02-1885,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
as...
and
there
are
three
that
are
relevant
here.
two
of
them
are
on
page
59
and
one
of
them
is
on
58a.
the
first
one
that
i
want
to
point
out
is
close
to
the
top
of
the
page.
it
is
an
affirmative
defense
under
the
texas
statute
that
the
managed
care
entity
did
not
deny
or
delay
payment.
this
is
not
about
treatment.
it
is
a
defense
that
it
did
not
deny
or
delay
payment.
and
of
course
delay
may
be
a
bid
for...
of
what
a...
of
what
the
role
of
the
administrator
is.
the
second
aspect
of
the
statute
is
that
the
statute
makes
very
clear,
once
again
on
page
59a,
that
the
managed...
that
the
liability...
oh.
this
is
subsection
d,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
is
the
next
following--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--you
know,
the
one
that
i
read.
and
it
says
the
act
creates
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
health
insurance
carrier,
moving
down
a
little,
to
cover
a...
to
provide
a
treatment
which
is
not...
which
is
not
covered
by
the
health
care
plan
or
entity.
once
again,
this
is
targeting
the
coverage
aspect,
not
the
treatment.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't...
i
don't
know
if
there's
anything
in
the
record
about
that.
what
is
clear
from
the
record
and
from
federal
law,
justice
stevens,
is
that
somebody
in
the
plan
would
have
discretion
to
hear
her
appeal,
even
if
the
nurse
that...
that
turned
the
request
down--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
would...
it
would
ultimately...
it
would
ultimately
turn
on...
on
a
coverage
decision
that
may
include
medical
criteria.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
but
the
question
of
medical
necessity
is
a
coverage
term.
it
is
not
a
medical
term,
justice
stevens,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it...
one
has
to
make...
one
part
of
the
coverage
decision
is
the
medical
decision.
in
the
aetna
case,
for
example,
the
plan
sets
forth
a
definition
of
medical
necessity
which...
which
sets
forth,
i
do
point
out,
is
that
you
have
to
need
it...
to
need
the
care--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
once
again,
justice
stevens,
we
do
not
contend
that
health
insurance
does
not
involve
the
consideration
of
medical
factors.
and,
as
i
said,
it
is
almost
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
product
that
it
would,
just
as
i
never
had
car
insurance
before
i
actually
owned
a
car.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
not
right,
justice
o'connor,
for
the
following
reason.
the
plan
documents
here,
and
the
background
understanding
of
all
of
the
parties,
is
that
it
is
for
the
treating
doctor
to
chart
the
course
of
treatment
for
the
patient
and,
in
fact,
under
the
ama's
old
code
of
ethics,
which
we
cite
on
page
6
of
the
aetna
reply
brief,
a
physician
is
not
allowed
to
sway
his
judgment
as
to
treatment
by
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
coverage.
in
many
cases,
unfortunately,
there
will
be
people
who
have
no
coverage
or
no
insurance,
or
may
be
under-insured.
but
just
to
bring
back
the
case
to
what
the
statute
is
about,
this
statue
is
about
encouraging
employers
to
make
hard
choices
to
give
coverage
to
employees
to
the
extent
they
can.
there
is
no
requirement
in
federal
law
that
requires
employers
to
give...
there
are
very
few
requirements
in
federal
law
that
require
employers
to
give
particular
benefits
if
they
choose
to
have
a
plan.
and,
as
this
court
has
said,
most
recently
in
the
rush
case,
this
is
about
a
bargain
with
employers
that
seeks
to
encourage
the
formation
of
these
plans
and
the
provision
of
benefits
to
the
extent
possible
by
assuring
employers
of
limited
liabilities
under
predictable
standards.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
would
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
our
amicus,
the
department
of
labor,
may
take
a
slightly
different
view
of
that.
our
reading
of
the
mertens
case
and
the
great
west
case,
which
seemed
very
clearly,
to
us,
at
least,
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
equitable
is
to
be
determined
by
reference
to
an
historical
examination
of
all
that
is
available
in
equity--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--aetna
is...
and
cigna
is
for
purposes
of
claims
processing.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
was
the
view
to
which
i
refer
earlier,
justice
ginsberg,
and
it
is
possible
that
it
may
be
right.
it
seems
to
me,
based
on
great
west
and
mertens,
that
it
would
be
a
tough
case
to
make,
but
it
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
now--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
it
might,
but
it
also
works
in
the
way
it
currently
is
for
the
following
reason.
the
interaction
of
the
structure
of
section
502
and
section
503
is
intended
to
set
forth
a
mechanism,
under
the
dol
regs
under
section
503,
to
encourage
the
expedis...
the
expeditious
resolution
of
claims
disagreements.
and
this
is...
the
statute
contemplates
litigation
but
is
not
about
litigation.
this
is
all
about
giving
the
benefit
when
it
is
needed
and
not
about
waiting
until
it
no
longer
helps
you,
having
bypassed
all
avenues
you
had
at
the
time,
external
review,
plan
appeals,
or
maybe
an
action
for
an
injunction
and
then
suing
for
relief,
make
whole
or
otherwise.
if
i
could,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well
it
is
true
by
virtue
of
dol
regulations
which
provide
that
no
claim
may
be
turned
down,
without
input
from
a
medical
professional
in
the
relevant
area.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
was
going
to
be
one
of
my
points--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
consistent
with
every
case,
from
pilot
life,
taylor,
and
ingersoll
rand.
because
in
each
of
those
cases,
you
were
dealing
with
an
insurance
company
that
was
acting
as
a
claim
administrator
or
insurer
with
respect
to
an
erisa
plan.
and
if
memory
serves,
the
claim
was
made
as
well
in
pegram,
and
the
court
dealt
with
at
the
top
of
page
223
of
530
u.s.,
by
pointing
out
that
a
contract
between
an
hmo
and
the
plan
may
itself
contain
elements
of
a
plan
to
the
extent
that
it
governs
the
circumstances
under
which
benefits
may
be
obtained.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no
and
in
fact
it
is
also
not
true
in
this
case
that
that's
so.
because
you
have
been
citing
subsection
(c)(2)
of
the
statute,
here
under
section
(d)
it
is
affirmatively
stated
that
nothing
in
the
act
shall
be
construed
to
provide...
to
require
the
provision
of
something
that
is
not
covered
and
that
is
at
page...
also
59
(a)
of
the
aetna.
just
let
me
take
one
second
to
make
two
points.
it
is
of
course
open
to
texas
to
have
a
law
that
regulates
the
practice
of
medicine,
by
telling
hospitals
do
not
discharge
somebody
who
needs
care.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
statute
that
would
keep
them
from
doing
that.
in
fact
we
have
a
federal
statute
in
papa
that
does
something
similar
with
respect
to
hospitals
that
take
in
medicare
money.
with
respect
to
how
quickly
we
could
do
these
things
justice
stevens,
the
dol
regulations
say
that
consistent
with
the
urgency
of
the
situation
it
must
be
done
as
soon
as
possible.
it
can
be
done
informally
and
the
doctor
may
act
for
the
patient
to
pursue
all
of
the
plan
appeals
and
that
is
at
pages
17(a)
and
3(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief.
brief
word
about
the
insurance
savings
clause,
i
will
not
belabor
it.
there
is
a
footnote
in
one
of
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
doesn't
raise
the
clause
as
opposed
to
the
section
502
issue,
but
the
acid
test
is
that
there
was
no
mention
of
the
clause,
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
under
this
court's
rules
and
oklahoma
city
versus
tuttle
that
is
completely
reclusive.
should
we
need
to
reach
it
i
will
point
out
that
one
of
the
response...
the
petitioners
in
this
case
is
a
self
funded
plan,
in
the
cigna
case,
which
would
be
saved
by
the
deemer
clause
even
if
the
insurance
clause
did
apply
in
this
case.
and
that
is
to
both
of
them,
the
question
whether
the
insurance
savings
clause
does
apply
was
conclusively
resolved
by
pilot
life,
has
never
been
revisited
by
the
court,
and
that
pilot
life--
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
