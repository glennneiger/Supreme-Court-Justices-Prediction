mr.
david
c.
mattax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
texas
legislature
has
imposed
a
duty
of
ordinary
care
on
managed
care
entities
that
insert
themselves
into
health
care
treatment
decisions
by
exercising
medical
judgment
to
decide
medical
necessity.
it
is
important
to
recognize
at
the
outset
as
this
court
recognized
the
managed
care
entity
is
not
the
erisa
plan.
our
statute
does
not
impose
liability
on
the
erisa
plan.
our
statute
does
not
impose
liability
on
an
employer.
as
mr.
estrada
said
in
his
argument,
the
whole
point
of
the
complete
preemption
and
the
exclusive
remedies
provision
section
502(a),
is
insuring
employers
that
will
have
limited
liabilities.
our
statute
explicitly
excludes
employers
from
liability.
and
therefore
the
concerns
of
section
502(a)
are
not
at
play
in
the
texas
statute.
the
reason
the
texas
statute
was
passed
was
because
managed
care
entities,
hmos
and
other
varieties
and
forms,
had
decided
to
exercise
medical
judgment.
and
it
is
that
duty
that
the
state
is
regulating.
which
is
what
i
think
distinguishes
this
case
from
pilot
life.
going
back
and
looking--
mr.
david
c.
mattax
--yes,
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
mattax
pilot
life
was
based
on
the
court's
complete
preemption
decision
in
allis-chalmers
versus
lueck.
mr.
david
c.
mattax
and
in
that
case
the
court
recognized
that
the
tort
claim
that
was
being
alleged
was
derived
from
the
general
proposition
to
perform
contracts
in
good
faith.
and
the
duty
that
the
court
was
looking
at
in
allis-chalmers,
and
also
pilot
life,
was
the
duty
to
enforce
the
contract
that
was
the
erisa
plan
therefore
implicating
complete
preemption.
however
the
court
explicitly
said
in
allis-chalmers,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
give
the
substance
of
provisions
the
force
of
federal
law,
ousting
any
inconsistent
state
regulations,
because
such
a
rule
would
allow
labor
unions,
and
unionized
employees
the
power
to
exempt
themselves
from
whatever
state
labor
standards
they
disfavored.
and
again
the
texas
statute
is
not
imposing
any
duty
on
the
plan.
mr.
david
c.
mattax
no
i
disagree.
the
revision
in
the
act
is
setup
such
that
if
a
managed
care
entity
were
to
come
in
and
say
well
i
did
not
exercise
any
medical
judgment,
or
i
did
not
make
any
decisions
that
affected
the
treatment,
they
could
come
in
as
a
defense
and
say,
the
reason
i
did
not
make
any
medical
judgment
was
because
the
plan
did
not
allow
me
to.
the
plan
simply
excluded
that
completely
in
a
pure
eligibility
decision
in
the
court's
words
in
pegram.
so
the
cause
of
action
that's
alleged
in
the
state
statute
is
that
particular
managed
care
entity,
exercised
medical
judgment.
and
that
medical
judgment
resulted
in
an
injury
to
me,
and
i
think--
mr.
david
c.
mattax
--and
if--
mr.
david
c.
mattax
--the
statute
provides
that
as
a
defense.
again
to
make
a
reflection
of,
to
show
that
in
that
particular
case,
i
as
a
managed
care
entity
did
not
exercise
any
medical
judgments,
because
that's
the
defense--
mr.
david
c.
mattax
--correct.
and
if
they're
making
a
decision
with
regards
to
medical
judgment.
and
they
are
exercising
that
judgment
not
according
to
our
standard
here.
we
are
imposing
that
on
the
managed
care
entity.
mr.
david
c.
mattax
and
what
i'm
saying
there
is--
mr.
david
c.
mattax
--that
is
a
defense
to
the
claim.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
caterpillar
versus
williams
a
defense
being
raised
to
a
claim
does
not
create
complete
preemption.
mr.
david
c.
mattax
there's
separate
duties
involved
here.
there
is
a
duty
under
the
plan,
and
the
beneficiary
can
go
to
the
plan
and
say
because
you
hired
this
managed
care
entity
to
make
this
judgment,
i
would
like
to
get
the
benefits
under
the
plan
and
that
would
be
a
claim
against
the
benefit
plan.
what
texas
has
done
has
said,
when
a
managed
care
entity,
an
hmo
goes
and
sells
his
products
to
a
plan,
or
goes
and
sells
its
services
to
a
plan
and
is
going
to
exercise
medical
judgment,
then
the
state
of
texas
will
regulate
the
exercises
of
that
medical
judgment
of
that
managed
care
entity.
mr.
david
c.
mattax
it
is
theoretically
anyone
who
exercises
medical
judgment
that
influences
care.
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
reasons
for
managed
care
as
stated
by
both
the
petitioners
here,
and
i
would
briefly
quote
from
a
cigna
brief,
page
44.
utilization,
review
techniques
are
designed
to
ensure
that
quality
care
is
delivered
as
cost
efficiently
as
possible.
the
letter
to
mr.
davila's
doctor,
specifically
says...
this
in
aetna's
petition
or
appendix
88...
as
part
of
our
commitment
to
provide
access
to
quality
care.
what
the
court
needs
to
recognize
if
i
may,
is
that
prior
to
the
rise
of
managed
care,
decisions
were
made
on
a
retrospective
basis.
an
insurer
would
say,
well
we've
looked
at
this,
we
do
not
believe
it
was
medically
necessary,
we're
not
going
to
pay
for
it.
the
difference
now
is,
managed
care
has
taken
on
the
rubric
of
saying,
we
will
manage
care,
we
will
determine
what
is
best
for
the
patient
and
we
will
do
that
by
dictating
what
is
going
to
be
paid
for,
and
not
paid
for.
mr.
david
c.
mattax
well
respectfully
the
statement
is
we
don't
think
it's
good
for
you.
we
don't
think
this
care
is
appropriate
for
your
particular
situation.
and
there's
no
reason--
mr.
david
c.
mattax
--well
the
plan
itself
can
put
in
the
term
medical
necessity,
but
the
plan
is
not
making
the
determination
of
whether
it's
medically
necessary
or
not.
they
have
hired
someone
to
make
that
determination
for
them.
they
may--
mr.
david
c.
mattax
--but
the
reason
to
make
that
decision
is
because
the
medical
necessity
decision
is
a
result
of
a
determination
by
that
managed
care
entity
that
they
are
going
to
manage
the
care
that's
provided.
again
the
letter
that
was
sent--
mr.
david
c.
mattax
--but
the
decision
is
based
on
a
determination
by
a
managed
care
entity
that
in
their
medical
judgment
that
the
care
is
not
necessary.
and
what
texas
has
said,
with
respect
to
that
managed
care
entity.
again
not
the
plan.
is
that
when
you
are
going
to
exercise
medical
judgment
and
that
is
going
to...
as
a
matter
of
practical
reality,
impact
the
care
a
patient
receives
and
potentially
cause
damage
to
that
patient,
then
we
will
regulate
that
as
a
separate
duty,
separate
and
apart
from
erisa.
mr.
david
c.
mattax
and
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
what
the
statute
is
concerned
about
is
limiting
and
defining
the
liability
of
employers
and
plan
sponsors.
and
a
statute
that
regulates
the
conduct
of
a
third
party
who
sells
their
services
to
that
plan
or
plan
sponsor,
has
no
impact
on
the
liability
of
that
plan
or
that
plan
sponsor.
and
in
this
particular
case,
in
texas
we
have
made
a
determination
that
with
managed
care
entities
as
an
entity,
be
it
an
hmo,
be
it
a
ppo,
exercising
medical
judgment,
we
are
regulating
the
medical
judgment
of
that
third
party.
mr.
david
c.
mattax
thank
you.
