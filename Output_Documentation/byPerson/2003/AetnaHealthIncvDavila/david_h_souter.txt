justice
david
h.
souter
the
strangeness
of
your
argument
is
that
you
said
all
right,
pilot
life
faced
that
issue,
and
says
the
savings
clause
doesn't
apply
in
the
complete
preemption
situation.
your
argument
is
that
in
effect
by
defining
the...
the
benefit...
by
texas'
act
of
trying
to
define
the
benefit
denial
as
equivalent
to
the
practice
of
medicine,
it
therefore
gets
us
back
into
the
insurance
savings
clause.
it
seems
to
me
an
irrational
logical
leap.
502
says
we
get
out
of
the
insurance
savings
clause
because
of
complete
preemption,
texas
says
by
saying
what
you're
really
doing
in
denialing...
denying
a
benefit,
is
practicing
medicine.
we
get
back
into
the
business
of
insurance,
and
the
insurance
savings
clause
applies.
i
just
can't
follow
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
they're
the
ones
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
there
any
insurer
that
does
not
at
some
point
incorporate
some
issue
of
medical
judgement
in
it's
coverage?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
does
not,
then
in
effect
it
is
giving
carte
blanche
to
any
medical
decision
by
a
doctor
without
right
of
review.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
pegram
you
were
dealing
with
the
doctor
who
was
the
treating
physician,
that
is
precisely
what
justice
breyer
has
just
defined
as
not
being
the
case
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
we
were
dealing
with
a
treating
physician,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
treating
physician
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
except
that
you
say
when
it's
made
here
it
is
the
choice
of
the
doctor,
the
pharmacy
or
the
hospital
to
seek
that
judgment
early,
isn't
it.
in
other
words
in
the...
the
doctor
could
have
gone
ahead
and
prescribed
vioxx,
and
sent
the
bill
in.
the
doctor
could
have
kept
the
patient
in
the
hospital
another
day,
and
sent
the
bill
in.
the
insurance
plan
didn't
force
an
early
decision.
it
gave
an
option
of
an
early
decision,
so
they
would
know
where
they
stood.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
don't
get
it
then,
they
automatically
deny
it
later?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
they
do
force
it.
my
premise
was
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
claim
that
depends
on
a
denial
of
benefits,
and
isn't
that
the
touchstone
under
pilot?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
is
the
predicate
for
payment
denial,
or
a
payment
granted.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
let's
go
back
to
my
question...
i
didn't
mean
to
go
off
on
a
tangent.
my
question
was,
doesn't
pilot
life,
turn
on
a
determination
which
governs
the
payment
or
non
payment
of
benefits?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
this
it
seems
to
me
is
such
a
determination.
