yes,
but
if
you
make
an
analogy
to
a
trustee
in
equity,
i
think
this
is
a
different
case
than
mertens
or
great
west,
because
here,
let's
see,
aetna
and
cigna
are
fiduciaries,
are
they
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
and
so,
as
a
fiduciary
they're...
they
are
analogous
to
a
trustee,
at
least,
the
government
said,
if
i
read
their
footnote
13
right,
that
back
in
the
old
days
when
there
was...
was
a
division
of
the
bench,
that
one
of
the
remedies
available
against
a
trustee
would
be
in
the
nature
of
make
whole
relief
that
would
put
the
beneficiary
in
the
position
he
would
have
been
in
if
the
trustee
had
not
committed
the
breach
of
trust.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
government
has
taken
position...
this
is...
the
footnote
is
not
the
easiest
to
read,
but
i
take
it
the
department
of
labor
has
taken
the
position,
in
some
erisa
cases,
that
there
would
be
just
the
kind
of
relief
that
justice
scalia
mentioned.
would
this
case
fit
that
pattern?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
as
mr.
estrada
just
told
us
that,
for
these
purposes,
both
aetna
and
cigna
would
be
fiduciaries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
can't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
take
it
you...
the
drug
case,
the
man
couldn't
pay
for
the
more
expensive
drugs.
he
didn't
have
the
means
and
so
he
took
the
drugs
that
the
hmo
approved
with
disastrous
results.
there
was
no...
window...
there
was
no
time.
he
was
in
intense
pain.
he
had
to
take
something
to
deal
with
the
pain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which...
this
is
one
item
i
meant
to
ask.
on
the
other
side
they
said
that
you
never
made
any
noises
about
the
savings
clause
in
the
fifth
circuit,
that
it
entered
the
case
just
at
this
level,
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
in
your
brief
before
the
fifth
circuit?
