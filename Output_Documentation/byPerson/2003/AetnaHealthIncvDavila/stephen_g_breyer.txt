g.
breyer
no,
but
the
whole
thing
would
work
if
we
could
do
that,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
if
we
could
get
mertens
consistent
with
what
justice
ginsberg
just
read,
then
you
would
provide
people
who
are
hurt,
in
the
way
these
plaintiffs
were
hurt,
with
a
remedy.
it
wouldn't
be
punitive
damages,
but
they
would
be
made
whole.
so,
if
you
are
right
in
that
this
is
basically
a...
this
is
basically
a
claims
decision
and
you
shouldn't
give
punitives
and
others
for
the
incorrect
making
of
a
claims
decision.
but
the
hole
in
this
is
that
then
the
woman
gets
nothing
or
virtually
nothing
and,
if
we
could
reconsider
that
part,
it
would
all
work,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
that's
why
i'm
thinking
that
vioxx
is
not
that...
you
know,
on
your
argument
you
were
just
making,
and
i'll
only
lead
you
into
this
red
herring
once.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
would
all
work,
you
see,
if
i
have
a
trust,
the
trust
is
supposed
to
buy
me
an
insurance
policy,
and
through
total
fault
of
the
trust
it
doesn't,
and
the
house
burns
down,
the
equitable
relief
appropriate
would
be
consequential
damages
of
the
value
of
the
house.
now,
if
that
were
an
appropriate
case,
other
equitable
relief,
this
whole
thing
would
work
and
you
wouldn't
be
having
to
fill
a
vacuum.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
see
then
the
logical
point
where
i'm...
i'd
like
to
say
modify
those
perhaps,
but,
well,
the
very
fact
that
you're
trying
to
fill
this
hole
here
proves
the
point,
because
if
there
is
a
hole,
it's
because
the
court
has
interpreted
this
statute
perhaps
wrongly
as
the
federal
relief
being
a,
b,
and
c.
maybe
it
should
be
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
and
so
what
the
state's
trying
to
do
here,
is
add
d.
and
the
one
thing
they
can't
do,
is
add
d
to
a,
b,
and
c.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
both.
it's
both
and
the
trouble
with
it
is,
if
you...
you
could
have
marvelous
laws
in
texas
governing
pension
trustee
behavior,
governing
all
trustee
behavior.
but
congress
says
well
you
can't
apply
your
marvelous
rules
to
erisa
plan
trustees.
and
now
it
seems
to
have
said,
and
you
can't
apply
your
marvelous
medical
rules,
even
to
a
doctor,
where
what
the
doctor
is
doing
in
that
instance
is
not
acting
as
a
doctor
for
treating
the
patient,
but
rather
acting
as
a
determiner
of
whether
he
will
get
the
erisa
plan
payment.
and
what
we
have
in
your
case
i
guess
is
a
person
who
does
both.
he
does
something
of
both.
but
where
they
are
inextricably
mixed
and
where
there
is
a
very
large
share
of
making
the
benefit
determination,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
congress
would
have
wanted
the
texas
law
to
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
distinguish
it
from
pilot
life?
i
mean
pilot
life
is
talking
about
the
insurance
part,
wasn't
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
they
said
that
even
though
apparently
on
it's
face
had
to
do
with
insurance
and
you'd
think
it
would
have
been
taken
out,
it
wasn't
taken
out
because
of
the
fact
that
it
interfered
with
the
basic
purposes
of
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
back
to
pilot
life.
in
my
understanding
of
the
case,
maybe
i've
got
this
wrong.
tell
me
if
i
do.
there's
a
plan
that
says,
an
erisa
plan
says
we
pay
you
for
a
treatment
that's
medically
necessary.
then
there's
a
person,
it
may
be
an
insurance
company,
it
may
be
a
doctor,
maybe
somebody
says
it
isn't
medically
necessary.
the
plaintiff
thinks
it
is
medically
necessary,
so
the
question
is
whether
the
plan
did
what
it
said.
now
you
have
a
way
of...
i
mean
isn't
that
what
this
is
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
could
say
that
in
respect
to
any
benefit
of
a
plan.
let's
imagine
a
plan
with
millions
of
different
benefits.
whenever
a
benefit
is
turned
down,
there
will
always
be
a
human
being
who
told
the
plan
manager
it
isn't
called
for.
now
a
state
could
come
in
and
regulate
their
human
being,
those
human
beings
in
their
capacity
as
professionals
and
say
whenever
they
make
such
a
mistake,
they've
made
a
professional
misjudgment
and
we
give
you
an
extra
remedy
here.
and
that
seems
to
be
the
thing
that
this
statute
forbids.
i
don't
see
how
to
get
around
it.
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
how
to
get
around
it.
but
i
don't
see
it
at
the
moment.
