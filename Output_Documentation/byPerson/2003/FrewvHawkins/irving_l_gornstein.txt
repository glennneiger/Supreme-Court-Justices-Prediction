mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
enforcement
of
the
decree
in
this
case
does
not
violate
the
eleventh
amendment
for
two
reasons.
first,
any
eleventh
amendment
objection
was
waived,
and
second,
enforcement
is
permissible
under
ex
parte
young.
now,
the
waiver
issue
arises
in
this
case
because
the
state
officials
are
arguing
that
the
relief
in
the
consent
decree
that
is
directed
to
them
violates
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
it
is
that
eleventh
amendment
objection
that
those
same
officials,
together
with
the
attorney
general,
waived
when
they
asked
the
district
court
to
enter
the
very
relief
that
they
are
now
objecting
to
on
eleventh
amendment
grounds.
and
the
reason
that
there
is
waiver
is
that
under
this
court's
cases,
when
the
attorney
general
on
the...
of
the
state
on
behalf
of
the
state
invokes
a
federal
court's
jurisdiction,
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
waived.
now,
when
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
entered
into
a
consent
decree
on
behalf
of
state
officials
in
their
official
capacity
and
then
asked
the
district
court
to
enter
that
decree,
he
clearly
invoked
that
court's
jurisdiction
and
waived
any
eleventh
amendment
objection
to
the
entry
of
that
judgment
against
those
state
officials.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
first
of
all,
you
would
have
the
question
of
waiver,
and
that
is
answered
by
the
inquiry
that
lapides
and
other
waiver
cases
have...
have
instructed,
which
is
do
those...
are
those
officials
authorized
by
state
law
to
conduct
litigation
on
behalf
of
the
state.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
would
say...
i
would
say
it's
a
legal
question--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
typically
in
almost
every
state,
justice
scalia,
it
would
be
the
attorney
general
who
is
authorized
to
represent
the
state
in
litigation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
then
you
get
to
the
second
argument
in
this
case
which
is
an
ex
parte
young
argument,
and
the
ex
parte
young
issue
is
that
the
consent
decree
in
this
case
is
permissible
under
ex
parte
young
because
it
provides
prospective
relief
against
state
officials
based
on
the
federal
medicaid
statute.
and
those
are
the
three
requirements
of
an
ex
parte
young
suit,
that
it
be--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--in
an
ex
parte
young
action,
state
officials
like
all
other
federal
litigants
are
free
to
enter
into
consent
decrees
that
go
beyond
what
is
strictly
required
by
federal
law
on
one
or
more
issues
because
there
is
a
tradeoff.
they
then
get
less
relief
or
no
relief
on
other
issues
that
they
may
care
about.
so
this
is
a
system
that
benefits
federal
court
litigants
generally,
and
it
is
also
one
that
benefits
the
state
and
its
state
officials.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
first
of
all,
we...
we
presume...
this
court
presumes
that
state
officials,
when
they
act
in
their
official
capacity,
are
acting
in
good
faith
to
implement
the
best
interests
of
the
state.
second
of
all,
the
state
does
benefit
when
its
officials
can
enter
into
decrees
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
don't
know
of
any
such
case,
and
as
i
was
telling
justice
scalia
before,
all
the
court's
waiver
cases
up
until
now
have
been
ones
in
which
the
attorney
general
has
represented
the
state
and
has
waived
the...
has...
has
been
authorized
by
the
state
to
represent
the
state's
interests
in
litigation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i
don't
think
it...
it
is
a
necessary...
waiver
is
not
a
necessary
concomitant
because
it
is
a
component
of
an
ex
parte
young
case.
this
court
said,
for
example,
in
the
rufo
case
that
state...
it
had
no
doubt
that
state
and
local
officials,
in
order
to
resolve
litigation,
could
agree
to
relief
that
goes
beyond
what's
required
by
federal
law.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
but
let...
let
me
explain
further.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
i
didn't
say
it
went
beyond
ex
parte
young.
i
said
it
went
beyond
what
was
strictly
required
by
federal
law.
and
as
this
court
said
in
the
rufo
case,
every
federal
court
remedial
order
that's
entered
by
a
federal
court
goes
beyond
what's
strictly
required
by
federal
law.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
milliken
permits
that
as
long
as
it's
aimed
at
remedying
a
violation.
but
there's
one
step
beyond
milliken
here,
and
that
rufo
says
that
you
can
even
agree
to
relief
that
goes
beyond
what
a
court
would
order
after
a
trial
as
long
as
the
relief
furthers
the
objectives
of
the
underlying
law
because
there
you
are
operating
with
the
consent
of
the
state
officials
in...
in
selecting
that
relief.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
at
some
point
it
has
to
resolve
a
bona
fide
dispute
within
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
court
as
well,
and
if
there's
no
arguable
violation
of
federal
law
that
the
relief
relates
to,
then
it
falls
outside
of
what
a
court
should
enter
as
a
decree
under
rufo.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in
general,
once
a
decree
has
been
entered,
there's
no
objection
that
can
be
made
at
the
enforcement
stage
other
than
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
but
subject
matter
jurisdiction
would
include
an
inquiry
into
whether
what
was
at
issue
in
the
case
was...
if
it
was
an
arguable
federal
claim
or
sought
to
further
the
objectives
underlying
an
arguable
federal
claim.
that's
going
to
be
rare
that
it
won't
do
that,
but
if
it
doesn't
do
that,
the
state
has
a
right
to
object
to
that
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
grounds.
by
the
way,
the
state
also
has
the
right
always
to
move
for
modification
of
provisions
under
this
court's
decision
in
rufo
that
are
not
arguably
related
to...
that
are
not
related
to
any
arguable
violation
of
federal
law.
if
it's
just
a
frivolous
underpinning
to
the
suit,
the...
the
state
could
always
move
for
modification
and
get
that
provision
eliminated
under
rufo.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
no.
i...
no.
rufo
itself
was
a
suit
against
local
officials,
but
what
rufo
said
is
that
state
and
local
officials
can
enter
into
these...
these
kinds
of
agreements
and
that
state
officials
and
local
officials
could
obtain
modifications
based
on
changes
in
circumstances.
