one
requirement
of
the
federal
medicaid
statute
is
that
participating
states
must
have
a
program
for
early
diagnosis
and
treatment
than
the
purposes
to
provide
early
healthcare,
particularly
to
children,
to
reduce
lifelong
vulnerability
to
illness
and
disease.
in
the
state
of
texas,
a
group
of
citizens
alleged
that
the
state
was
not
providing
these
services.
they
sued
the
state
of
texas
and
some
of
its
primary
healthcare
officials.
the
state
was
dismissed
from
the
proceedings,
but
the
suit
against
the
state
officials
remained,
the
so-called
ex
parte
young
suit.
the
case
did
not
proceed
to
trial
however,
it
was
settled
when
the
parties
agreed
on
a
consent
decree.
and
as
the
consent
decreed
that
is
the
important
part
of
this
case.
the
consent
decree
is
some
80
pages
long
and
it
directs
the
state
officials
to
take
specific
steps
which
are
not
mentioned
in
the
statute.
as
you
can
see,
because
the
decree
is
80
pages
and
the
statute
is
just
a
few
paragraphs.
for
instance,
the
decree
requires
the
state
officials
to
establish
a
toll-free
telephone
system.
the
decree
provides
detailed
instructions
for
advising
about
healthcare
services
on
that
telephone
network
and
arranging
doctor
appointments
and
transportation.
two
years
after
the
consent
decree
was
entered,
the
parties
who
brought
the
suit
commenced
an
action
to
enforce
it.
they
alleged
that
the
consent
decree
was
not
being
implemented
according
to
its
terms.
the
state
officials
defended
on
the
grounds
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
enforcement
of
the
decree
which
goes
beyond
the
precise
terms
of
the
statute.
the
district
court
rejected
that
contention,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
with
the
state
officials
and
it
reversed.
so,
we
took
the
case
to
consider
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
enforcement
of
the
consent
decree
in
these
circumstances.
we
conclude
the
amendment
is
not
a
bar
and
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
the
enforcement
of
the
consent
decree
is
consistent
with
the
eleventh
amendment
on
our
precedents
beginning
with
ex
parte
young.
the
decree
is
a
federal
court
order
that
springs
from
a
federal
dispute,
and
furthers
the
objectives
of
federal
law.
the
decree
reflects
a
choice
among
various
ways
that
a
state
could
implement
the
medicaid
act.
as
a
result,
enforcing
the
decree
vindicates
an
agreement
that
the
state
officials
reached
to
comply
with
federal
law.
federal
courts
are
not
reduced
to
approving
the
decree
and
hoping
for
compliance.
once
entered,
a
consent
decree
maybe
enforced.
enforcing
the
consent
decree
does
not
violate
the
eleventh
amendment.
now,
the
state
officials
warn
that
enforcement
of
the
consent
decree
and
if
the
consent
decree
is
rendered
under
ex
parte
young
can
undermine
the
sovereign
interest
and
accountability
of
state
governments.
the
law’s
primary
response
to
these
legitimate
concerns
is
found
not
in
the
eleventh
amendment
but
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
in
particular
rule
60(b)(5)
which
reflects
the
traditional
power
of
a
court
of
equity
to
modify
its
decree,
it
might
have
changed
circumstances.
state
officials
should
be
given
latitude
and
substantial
discretion
when
a
consent
decree
is
entered
under
ex
parte
young.
a
federal
court
must
exercise
its
equitable
powers
to
ensure
that
when
the
objects
of
the
decree
have
been
obtained,
responsibility
for
discharging
the
state’s
obligations
is
returned
promptly
to
the
state
and
its
officials.
our
opinion
reversing
the
court
of
appeals
is
unanimous.
