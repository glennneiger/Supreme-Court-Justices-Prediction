unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
on...
on
the
first
point?
you
say
when
state
officials
submit
to...
to
a
decree.
it's...
it's
immaterial,
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
whether
the
state
attorney
general
defended
the...
the
suit
or
represented
these
officials.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
understand
that,
but
suppose
he
hadn't
been
and
suppose
it
is
just
the
state
officials
who
appeared
in
an
ex
parte
young
suit.
they're...
they're
sued.
there's
no
other
state
official
who
takes
part
in
the
proceedings.
nonetheless,
they
enter
into
a
consent
decree.
is
it
your
submission
that
even
without
any
other
participation
by
anybody
else
in
the
state,
that
consent
decree
binds
not
just
them,
but
i
gather
you
say
future
officials
in...
in
their
offices?
right?
unknown
speaker
unrepresented.
you
would--
--well,
but
wouldn't...
wouldn't
there
be
a
question
of
fact
in
that
case?
i
mean,
it
would
be
odd,
i...
i
would
suppose
not
to
have
the
state
attorney
general
there,
and...
and
wouldn't
the...
if
i
were
a
trial
judge,
i'd
say,
well,
is
this
the
state
that
is
submitting
this...
this
settlement?
i
mean,
wouldn't...
wouldn't
there
be,
theoretically
at
least,
a
fact
question
in
justice
scalia's
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that...
but
that's
a
waiver
theory.
i
mean,
if
you're
proceeding
on
a
waiver
theory,
you...
you
need
the
state
there.
but
let's
assume
you're
not
proceeding
on
the
waiver
theory.
you
have
the
second
ground,
which
is
just
if
you
have
authority
to
enter
the
decree,
you
have
authority
to
enforce
the
decree.
now,
for
purpose
of
that
argument,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you
whether
the
state
attorney
general
is
there
or
whether
these
officials
have
the
power
to
represent
the
state?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
it's
consistent
with
the
eleventh
amendment
without
any
waiver.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
us
how
it
worked?
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
was
in
court
and
he
stands
up
and
he
says,
we
insist
on
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
judge
say,
all
right,
that's
act
one.
it's
closed.
and
then
did
the
same
officials
stay
and
they
say,
well,
now
we're
here
on
the
eleventh
amendment?
i
mean,
how...
how
did
this
work?
and--
unknown
speaker
--and
let...
let
me
just
say
also
there's
no
excerpt
of
record
or
docket
entry.
the
only
thing
i
have
is
the
consent
decree.
was
there
any
order
saying
the
consent
decree
dated
so
and
so
is
hereby
entered
as
the
judgment
of
the
court?
i
mean,
can
i
find
that
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
and--
--there
was
no
separate
order.
it
was
just
this
consent
decree
that's
in
the
lodging.
that's--
unknown
speaker
--that's
it.
unknown
speaker
okay.
now
maybe
we
can
go
back
and
you
can
tell
me
who
the...
was
there
an
act
one
and
an
act
two,
act
one
being
the
state
asserts
immunity,
act
two
being
the
eleventh
amendment,
or...
or
were
the
same
parties
before
the
court
at
all
times?
unknown
speaker
wearing
different...
wearing
different
hats
or
proceeding
under
some
different
theory.
unknown
speaker
right.
that's
the
puzzle
in
this
case.
the
state
as
state
was
dismissed
at
the
threshold,
and
then
we
have
an
ex
parte
young
case.
and
now
we're
talking
about
eleventh
amendment
immunity
again.
so
the
state
is
out
of
the
case.
it's
proceeding
as
an
ex
parte
young
case.
how
did
it
then
become
converted
back
into
a
case
against
the
state
so
that
we're
talking
about
whether
the
state
waived
its
immunity?
unknown
speaker
the
state,
if...
if
i
remember
correctly,
came
before
the
judge
and
urged
the
approval
of
this
consent
decree.
unknown
speaker
did
it
not?
and
there
were...
there
were
several
representatives
of
the
state
who
so
testified.
unknown
speaker
that...
that's
your
waiver.
that's
the
waiver
side
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
i
frankly
am
reluctant
to...
to
decide
the
case
on
that
ground
if
another
ground
is
available
simply
because
that
would
require
a
case-by-case
investigation
as
to...
to
what
extent
the
participation
by...
by
other
state
officials
existed,
whether
they
were
authorized
to
participate
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
whereas,
your
other
ground
doesn't
require
that...
that
case-by-case
investigation,
and
wouldn't
that
be
a...
a
much
clearer
line
to...
to
establish?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
make
sure
that
the
state
attorney
general
was
authorized
to
represent
the
state
in
this
case
or
whatever
other
official
you
say
committed
the
waiver.
that
would...
that
would
be
a
factual
investigation
in
every
case,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
justice
scalia's
question
didn't
go
to
waiver.
it
went
to
representation.
and
lapides
says,
if
you
can
represent,
you
can
waive.
but
there
would
be
a
question
of
representation,
wouldn't
there?
unknown
speaker
once...
once
it
was
understood
that
he
could
represent.
unknown
speaker
oh,
sure.
easy.
i
mean,
i'm...
i'm
not
saying
that
this
would
be
a
difficult
case,
but
you
would
have
to,
i
suppose,
make
that
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
this
case
might
not
be
difficult,
but
i...
i
don't
like
going
rummaging
around
in
state
law.
i
find
federal
law
hard
enough.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
ms.
zinn,
i
thought
that
you
said
in
response
to
my
question
that
this...
this
waiver...
that's
not
your
preferred
ground.
you
said
you're
arguing
it
because
the
state
insisted
that
this
was
eleventh
amendment
and
it
wasn't
waived.
but
your...
you
brought
an
ex
parte
young
suit.
you've
got
a
consent
decree
under
that
heading,
and...
and
that
argument,
if
it
prevails,
would
be...
one
would
not
need
to
reach
the
question
of
the
eleventh
amendment
in
the....
unknown
speaker
let's
put...
put
it
this
way.
are
you
saying
that
if
the
state
officials
negotiate
a
consent
decree
that
goes
beyond
the
eleventh
amendment...
or
that
goes
beyond...
pardon
me...
that
goes
beyond
ex
parte
young's--
unknown
speaker
--rules,
that
then
there
must
be
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
how
can
they
do
that
without
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
especially
if
they've
asserted
their
immunity
at
the
beginning.
unknown
speaker
so
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
that
says
after
the
state
has
specifically
asserted
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
its
officials
may
negotiate
a
consent
decree
which
goes
beyond
the
boundaries
of
jurisdiction
set
forth
in...
in
ex
parte
young
without
waiver.
unknown
speaker
well...
well,
you
introduced
the
point
of
remedy.
that
wasn't
part
of
my
question.
my...
my
question
was
whether
or
not,
having
asserted
the
immunity
in
a...
in...
under
the
assumption
that
the
immunity
has
not
been
waived,
the
state
officials
can
negotiate
a
consent
decree
that
goes
beyond
the
usual
rules
of
ex
parte
young,
it
goes
beyond
the
authority
granted
to
the
courts
under
ex
parte
young,
without
relying
on
the
theory
of
waiver.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
really
can't
tell
until
the
decree
is
entered
whether
or
not
it
complied
with
ex
parte
young,
i
would
think,
because
it
isn't
necessarily
fought
out
on
the...
in
the...
in
the
trial
of
the
case
exactly
what
the
remedy
will
be.
unknown
speaker
but
maybe...
maybe
there
should
be
a
special
rule
for
ex
parte
young
cases.
in
the
ordinary
case,
going
beyond
the
mere
violation
does
not
offend
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution,
but
the
argument
here
is,
oh,
once
you
go
beyond
holding
the
officer
to
compliance
with
federal
law,
once
you
go
beyond
that,
you're
out
of
ex
parte
young
and
you're
moving
against
the
state
and
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
bar.
so
maybe
there's
a
special
rule
with
regard
to
remediation
in...
in
ex
parte
young
cases.
unknown
speaker
is
this
outside
of
ex
parte
young?
i...
i
mean,
the
way
i
was
thinking
about
it,
which
might
not
be
right,
is
that
what
you
were
saying
in
the
second
part
of
your
argument
is
that
ex
parte
young
permits,
without
the
consent
of
a
state,
an
individual
to
sue
a
state
official
in
his
official
capacity,
asking
for
an
injunction
on
the
ground
that
the
official
has
violated
federal
law.
that's
what
ex
parte
young
says.
unknown
speaker
and
now
you
get
that
injunction,
and
that
injunction
contains
provisions
that
aren't
all
about
federal
law.
some
of
them
are
about
related
state
law.
and
i
thought
perhaps
the
way
to
look
at
it
was,
and
that
injunction
does
not
violate
the
eighth...
the
eleventh
amendment.
you
don't
need
a
state
to
give
consent
because
it's
all
part
of
an
effort
to
cure
the
federal
violation
with
related
matters
thrown
in.
unknown
speaker
ex
parte
young
authorizes
such
a
thing.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
last
statement
right?
unknown
speaker
so
then
it's
not
outside
ex
parte
young.
you're
giving
us
an
interpretation
of
what
ex
parte
young
means.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
your
authority
for
saying
that
ex
parte
young
validates
the
going
beyond
the
federal
issues
involved?
you
mentioned
milliken.
is
that...
is
that
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
talking
so
much
about
enforcement
as
about
entering
it
in
the
first
place
consistently
with
ex
parte
young.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
really
saying
that
it
doesn't
go
beyond
ex
parte
young.
i
mean,
the...
the
premises
of
some
of
the
arguments
here
that
it
does
go
beyond
it,
in
your
judgment,
is...
is
in
fact
a
false
premise.
unknown
speaker
when
you
had--
--would
you
help...
excuse
me.
may
i
ask
one
more
question?
would
you
help
me
on
one
thing?
my
understanding
was...
and
i...
i
may
simply
be
wrong
on
this.
my
understanding
was
that
the
claim
that
this
went
beyond
young
was
not
a
claim
that
it...
it
mandated
state
law...
or
mandated
the
performance
of
state
law
obligations,
but
that
it
went
further
than
it
had
to
to
enjoin
the
federal
violation
by
getting
into
details
about
what
the
state
officers
had
to
do
or
had
to
refrain
from
do...
from
doing.
am
i
correct
that
it's...
it's
not...
the
claim
is
not
that
it
got
into
state
law
but
that
it
simply
went
beyond
the
scope
of
a
proper
remedial
order
under
the
federal
law?
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
i
should
be
asking--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
zinn.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
attorney
general
had
not
been
involved
and
simply
the
state
officials
on
their
own
entered
into
this
consent
decree.
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
be
a
factual
inquiry
in
every
case
whether
the
particular
official--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
justice
scalia
can
preserve
his
own
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
that
there
was...
that
the
officials
did
not
have
the
authority
to
waive
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
they
did
enter
into
a
consent
decree.
unknown
speaker
this...
this
carries
you
so
far
beyond
the
theory
of
ex
parte
young,
and
the
theory
of
ex
parte
young
is
you're
not
impinging
upon
state
sovereign
immunity
when
you
are
simply
requiring
state
officials
to
adhere
to
state
law.
they
are
acting
ultra
vires
when
they're...
when
they're
violating
federal
law,
and
therefore,
you're
not
impinging
upon
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
but
now
with
the
theory
that
you're
expounding,
you're
not
only
holding
them
to
compliance
with
federal
law,
but
you're
saying
even
when
you're
not
acting
ultra
vires,
when
you
have
a
lot
of
perfectly
legal
options
of
how
to
comply
with
federal
law,
you
will...
you
will
choose
this
option.
and
that...
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
impinging
upon
state
sovereign
immunity
in...
in
a
way
that...
that
the
mere
theory
of
ex
parte
young
does
not
justify.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
worried
about
the
officials.
yes,
the
officials
get
a
good
deal.
they...
they
get
of
the
suit.
they
get
a...
a
decree.
but
what
about
the
state
who
on
our...
on
our
current
hypothesis,
the
state
is
out
of
the
proceeding.
the
attorney
general
is
not
there
and
here
are
these
state
officers
who
are
giving
away
a
whole
lot
of...
of
options
that
the
state
has,
and
they're...
they're
saying,
yes,
bind
the
state
even
though
the
suit
is
just
against
me.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gornstein,
is...
is
taking
the
attorney
general
out
of
it
kind
of
a
hypothetical
question?
do
you
know
of
any
institutional
decree,
whether
it
involves
schools,
prisons,
the
medicaid
program
which
the
state
attorney
general
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
might
be
improper
for...
for
the...
for
the
trial
court
to
go
beyond
strict
compliance
with
federal
law,
to...
to
approve
a
consent
decree
that
goes
beyond
that
without
the
presence
of
the...
i
mean,
maybe
waiver
is
a
necessary
concomitant
of...
of
the
theory
of
ex
parte
young
that
you're
giving
us.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gornstein,
i
want
to
clarify
what
you
mean
in
your
argument
when
you
say
go
beyond.
there
are...
and
here
are
two
possibilities.
one,
you
throw
in
an
entirely
new
obligation,
and
you
say,
you
know,
by
the
way,
we'll...
we'll
also
agree
to
a
program
of
pediatric
podiatry,
which
isn't
covered
by
the
statute.
we'll
do
that
too
just
to
show
you
how
good
our
faith
is.
a
second
possibility
is
we'll
show
you
how
we
will
implement
our
agreement
to
abide
by
what
we
understand
to
be
federal
court
law.
we
will
throw
in
a
how-to-do-it
or
a
how-we-are-going-to-do-it
clause.
i
understand
your
argument,
when
you
refer
to
going
beyond
the
letter
of
federal
law
and
agreeing
to
that
in
a
settlement,
to
refer
to
a
how-to-do-it
kind
of
agreement
as
opposed
to
a
new
substantive
obligation
agreement.
i
assume.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
my
question
is--
unknown
speaker
--why
do
you
acquiesce
in
this
phrase,
going
beyond
ex
parte
young?
have
you
ever--
unknown
speaker
--has
anybody
seen
a
consent
decree
that
simply
said,
we'll
obey
the
law?
unknown
speaker
that's
all--
unknown
speaker
--you
should
have
given
a
different
answer
to
justice
souter
then
because
certainly
pediatric
podiatry
would
further
the
objectives
of
the
law
to
provide
the
medical
care
to...
to
children.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
really
haven't
saved
us
a
whole
lot
of
trouble
then.
i...
i
frankly
thought
that
one
of
the
attractive
features
of
your
position
was
that
once
you
have
an
order,
that's
the
end
of
it.
you
don't
have
to
try
the
order
when...
when
you
seek
enforcement
to
parse
out
which
parts
of
it
go
too
far
and
which
parts
don't
go
too
far.
you
tell
me
there
are
some...
some
that
can
go
too
far.
we
have
to
look
to
whether
this
is
pediatric
podiatry
or...
or
not.
unknown
speaker
the
attorney
general
was
involved
in
the
case
in
rufo.
you
said
in
all
of
the
cases
that
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
cruz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
you
say
there's
no
violation
of
federal
law
now.
does
that
mean
there
was
no
violation
of
federal
law
when
the
lawsuit
began?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
isn't
it...
isn't
the...
in
order
to
determine
the
court's
power
to
act,
don't
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
at
the
time
litigation
started?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
understand
that,
but
still
it
seems
to
me
your...
your
jurisdictional
inquiry
would
focus
on
the
situation
at
the
time
the
litigation
commenced.
unknown
speaker
that's
right
because
the
state,
in
effect,
waived
its
right
to
adjudicate
that.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
that
mean
there
was
at
least
a
potential
violation
of
law
that
would
give
the
court
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
remedy,
which
might
go
beyond
merely
saying,
don't
violate
the
law
in
the
future,
that
because
you
may
have
violated
the
law
in
the
past,
i
have
the
power
to
order
you
to
do
some
things
that
may
not
in
themselves
be
illegal?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
in
order
to
enter
a
consent
decree,
the
judge
had
to
adjudicate
that
there
was
a
violation
of
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
so
you're...
you're
telling
us
that
the
effect
of
this
consent
decree,
what
texas
achieved
by
it,
is
it
comes
into
court
and
says,
oh,
let's...
let's
not
fight
about
whether
there
was
a
violation
or
not,
we'll
accept
a
consent
decree,
and
the
effect
of
this
consent
decree
is
simply
we'll
fight
about
this
same
question
later.
right?
unknown
speaker
and
you
haven't
given
up
anything
else.
you've
just
said,
let's...
let's
not
fight
about
this.
why
would
the
other
side
ever
accept
such
a
consent
decree?
it's
crazy.
unknown
speaker
you're
just
telling
them,
you
know,
just
dismiss
this
case,
and
if
you
want
to
get
us,
bring
the
same
case
later.
why
would
i
enter
into
such
a
consent
decree?
unknown
speaker
only
so
long
as
the
state
chose
to
do
it
because
on
your
theory,
you...
you
create
this
oddity.
they
had
power...
the
court
had
power
to
enter
the
decree
but
not
to
enforce
it.
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
this
had
been
a
litigated
judgment
and
the
exact
same
decree
came
out
at
the
end
of
the
line?
and
then
the
state
says,
well,
this
was
an
ex
parte
young
suit
and
even
though
we
litigated
and
lost,
we
can
still
say
all
bets
are
off
because
at
the
enforcement
stage,
you
have
to
prove
the
case
all
over
again.
now,
are
you
making
a
distinction
between
a
consent
decree
and
a
litigated
judgment,
or
do
you
accept
that
this...
if
this
case
had
been
litigated
and
that
decree
entered,
it
could
be
enforced?
unknown
speaker
why?
why
would
it
be
more
difficult?
it
seems
to
me
this
is
more
difficult.
you
agreed
to
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
matters
are
in
doubt
and
a
consent
decree
is
entered,
obviously
with
the
consent
of
both
parties...
that's
what
it
means...
that
it
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
it's
a
federal
judgment.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
your
argument,
as
i
understood
it
a
moment
ago,
is
that
you
can't
go
beyond
federal
law
because
there's
no
violation
of
federal
law
now.
and
that
would
be
exactly
the
same
whether
the
predicate
was
a...
a
litigated
judgment
or
a
consent
decree.
unknown
speaker
so
we're
in...
it
seems
to
me
you're
in
the
same
boat
under
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
so
in
other...
i
take
that
to
mean,
yes,
we
would
be
making
exactly
the
same
argument--
unknown
speaker
--if
this
had
been
a
litigated
decree.
we
would...
we
would
say
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
the
order
saying,
a,
you
did
something
wrong,
you
violated
federal
law,
and
b,
in
the
future
to
avoid
that,
you've
got
to
do
the
following
things,
a,
b,
c...
you
would
say
so
long
as
at
the
moment
of
enforcement
we
are
not
then
violating
federal
law
in
the
sense
found
in
the
judgment,
they
cannot
order
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
want
to
know
under
you.
[laughter]
on
your
theory,
isn't
that
going
to
be
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you're...
you're
getting
into...
into
a
general
answer,
and
i
want
a
specific
answer.
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
say
that
in...
that
following
the
litigated
case
with
an
a,
b,
c,
d
order,
you
would
say
that
if...
if
the
state...
if
the...
if
the
other
side
tried
to
enforce
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
you
could
come
into
court
and
say,
we
are
not
now
violating
federal
law
in
the
sense
originally
alleged.
therefore,
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e
cannot
be
enforced.
isn't
that
correct,
that
that
would
be
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
let's...
let's
compromise
on
an
answer
to
the
question.
your
answer
would
be
we
can
always
object
to
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
we
may
or
may
not
succeed,
but
we
can
always
object
to
it,
even
though
we
haven't
appealed
it.
unknown
speaker
we
didn't...
we
didn't
appeal
saying,
look,
supreme
court,
they...
you
know,
they...
they
nailed
us
to
the
wall
on
liability,
but
they
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
order
a,
b,
c,
and
d
and
e
because
they
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
it.
you
didn't
take
that
appeal
and
yet
you
feel
you
can
raise
that
later.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
what
is
the
purpose
of
doing
this?
i
mean,
let's
think
of
the
medicare
provisions
or
the
social
security
provisions,
the
regulations,
the
statutes.
they
cover
volumes.
think
of
consent
decrees.
yours
is
only
80
pages.
i
guess
others
might
be
hundreds
of
pages.
and
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
after
these
have
been
entered,
they've
been
entered
because
there
was
a
violation
of
federal
law
in
the
view
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
agreed.
okay?
now,
what
you're
saying
is
at
any
time,
we
go
through
these
hundreds
of
pages
and
we
try
to
figure
out
whether
each
word
in
these
hundreds
of
pages
actually
in
itself
reflects
the
federal
law
violation,
of
which,
remember,
there
were
3,000
volumes,
or
the
state
law
violation,
of
which
there
were
10,000
more
volumes,
and
once
we
figured
that
out,
then
you're
going
to
say
you
can
do
paragraph
867
but
you
can't
do
paragraph
868.
now,
i
just
wonder
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
exercise?
unknown
speaker
no.
i...
i
don't...
that's
not--
unknown
speaker
--that's
not
answering
my
question
at
all.
so
would
you
please
direct
yourself
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
asking
about
this
case.
i'm
asking
about
the
purpose
of
the
exercise
that
you
are
suggesting
that
the
constitution
requires
us
to
undertake.
my
suggestion
was
that
it
is...
i
was
trying
to
make
it
look
absurd
to
go
through
that
exercise
because
it
would
put
everybody
to
a
lot
of
work
for
no
real
reason.
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest.
now,
i
suggested
it
so
you
would
respond
to
it
because
i'm
sure
you
don't
agree
with
that,
and
therefore,
i'd
like
you
to
present
the
response.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
the
cases
require
it.
now,
if
that's
so,
that's
the
end
of
it.
you're
right.
but
i
had
the
impression
a
different
case
had
a
much
better
solution
to
the
problem
that
you
raise,
which
is
that
there's
some
provisions
in
this
thing
that
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
federal
law
at
all.
and
that's
called
rufo.
and
what
the...
what...
what
you're
supposed
to
do
in
that
situation
is
you
can
make
your
argument.
you
go
to
court.
you
say
rule
60(b).
you
say,
judge,
you
see
this
provision
over
here?
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything.
and
if
the
judge
is
right,
you
win.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
much
more
practical
approach
for
the
problem
that
you're
raising?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
can
never
move
for
modification
prior
to
an
enforcement
action?
unknown
speaker
the
fifth
circuit...
excuse
me.
the
fifth
circuit
said
you
had
to...
you
had
to
segment
this
decree
into
bites,
and
plaintiff
had
to
prove
each
one
of
them
as
a
violation
of
federal
law.
that's
worlds
different
from
saying,
here's
a
decree,
time
has
shown
that
it's
not...
that
it's
too
onerous,
so
court,
please
modify
it.
60(b)(5)
accepts
the
decree
as
valid
and
enforceable,
but
says
that
it
should
be
modified
in
light
of
our
experience
under
it.
now,
that's
quite
different
from
saying
you
can't
enforce
it.
you
have
to
prove
the
case
all
over
again
at
the
enforcement
stage.
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
make
a
virtue
of
a
necessity
and
say
that
that
is
precisely
your
response
to
justice
breyer,
that
you
cannot
do
what
you
want
to
do
under
rule
60(b)?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
that's--
--for
the
reason
that
justice
ginsburg
stated,
that
all
60(b)
enables
you
to
do
is
to
eliminate
provisions
that...
that
have
been
found
too
onerous,
not
to
eliminate
provisions
that
are
not
indeed
terribly
onerous
but
go
beyond
what...
what
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
impose.
it's
a
totally
different
question.
unknown
speaker
right?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
your
answer
to
justice
breyer.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
that
leaves
you
with
justice
ginsburg's
problem.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
modification
doesn't
depend
on
changed
circumstances,
does
it,
under
that
theory?
you're
saying
we
want
to
modify
it
because
we
shouldn't
have
agreed
to
it
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
are
allegations
of
fact
that
would
have...
the
allegations
did
allege
a...
a
violation
of
federal
law,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
not
an
answer
to
all...
the
statute
requires
more
than
waiting
for
requests
to
be
made.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
the
record,
you've
made
marvelous
and
extensive
changes
in
your
practices,
and
that's
why
you're
in
such
wonderful
shape
now.
but
maybe
you
wouldn't
have
been
if
the
lawsuit
had
never
been
filed.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
want
to
know
if
you
could
go...
could
you
go
through
60(b)?
that's
interesting.
now,
imagine...
i'll
give
a
silly
example
to
make
it
clear...
that
there's
a
requirement
in
the
consent
decree
you
have
to
give
every
child
a
hair
cut.
and
federal
law
doesn't
require
that,
but
there's
a
provision
in
state
law
that
the
barbers'
union
got
in.
all
right?
[laughter]
so
every
child
has
to
have
a
hair
cut.
so
you
find
the
decree
and
you
go
say,
judge,
i
want
this
modified.
look
what
it
is
over
here.
they
give
every
child
a
hair
cut.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
federal
law
whatsoever.
we
don't
want
to
give
every
child
a
hair
cut.
can
you
get
the
decree
modified
under
60(b)?
unknown
speaker
yes.
all
right.
well,
then
if
you
could
get
it
modified
under
60(b),
this
isn't
really
a
solution.
you
don't
need
your
solution.
you
can
go
in
under
60(b).
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
then
there's
no
problem.
we're
all
in
agreement.
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
think
you
have
a
right
to
go
in
under
60(b),
is
that
the
end
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cruz--
--you
have
to
assume
that
it's
too
onerous,
that
everything
that
goes...
goes
a
bit
beyond
what
federal
law
demands
is,
quote,
too
onerous.
is
that...
is
that
your
theory
of
60(b)?
unknown
speaker
well,
60(b)
is
basically
changed
circumstances
or
changed
law,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
beyond
that,
rufo
said
that
when
you're
dealing
with
a
state
or
a
municipality,
that
the
60(b)
is
more
flexible
than
it
would
be
if
you
were
dealing
with
a
private
party.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we're
talking
about
60(b).
and
i
think
the...
the...
you're
saying,
well,
this
is
essentially
the
same
thing.
it
isn't
because
what
you've
confronted
us
with
is
you
said,
yes,
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
enter
this
decree,
but
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
enforce
it.
that
was
your
plain
position,
and
that's
not
a
60(b)
position.
60(b)
is
the
court
can
enforce
it
unless
and
until
you
show
grounds
for
modification.
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
exercise
authority
till
the
plaintiffs
came
in
and
said,
look,
they're
violating
the
decree.
they're
not
carrying
out
all
their
promises.
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
said,
yes,
we
are.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
they
gave
up
their
lawsuit,
and
you're...
you're...
and
you
know,
packed
up
and
went
home,
and
you're
telling
them
that
they...
that
they
accomplished
nothing
by
doing
that.
they
got
to
re-initiate
the
whole...
the
whole
legal
process
to
get
you
to
do
what
they
want
you
to
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can't
say
it
was
voluntarily.
they
did
it
because
the
decree
required
them
to
do
it.
that's
coercive.
i
mean,
you
say
it's
voluntary,
but
then
why
didn't
you
do
it
before
the
lawsuit
started?
unknown
speaker
to
comply
with
the
decree.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
imposed
obligations
on
the
defendants
which
they
had
to
perform
in...
to
avoid
being
held
in
contempt
of
court.
unknown
speaker
it's...
it's
maybe
far
beyond.
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
but
it's
permissible.
rufo
was
concerned
with
requirements
that
were
not
permissible
under
federal
law.
and
that's...
that's
not
this
case.
and
you
have
the
obligation,
even
under
60(b),
to
show
that
compliance
is
burdensome
and
there's
changed
circumstances,
and
you
haven't
shown
that.
unknown
speaker
these
are
just
necessary
procedures
to
implement
the
program
and
to
make
it
work
well.
unknown
speaker
and
they
were
agreed
to
you
by
your
client.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
were
shown
that
the
failure
to
do
this
caused
serious
flaws
in
the
implementation
of
the
program.
unknown
speaker
the
court
surely
has
the
authority...
and
the
parties
certainly
have
the
right...
to
stipulate
to
provisions
that
will
make
the
consent
decree
effective.
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
that's
the
issue.
well,
excuse
me.
certainly
the
state
attorney
general
has...
and
by
the
way,
i
would
like
you
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
other...
the
other
basis
and
that
is
the
waiver
basis.
certainly
the
state
attorney
general
does
have
the
power
to
bargain
away
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
if...
if
you
consider
that
bargaining
it
away.
unknown
speaker
why...
assuming
everything
you
said
is
true,
that
this
goes
beyond
what
could
have
been
imposed
under
ex
parte
young,
nonetheless,
you
had
the
state
attorney
general
who
agreed
to
all
of
this.
it
was
not
just
these
individual
officers.
the
state
attorney
general
who
had
power
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
signed
this
consent
decree.
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
end
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
may
i
stop
you
at
that
point?
could
a
state
then
simply
say...
every
state
say
our
attorney
general
has
no
authority
to
waive
our
sovereign
immunity,
and
then
you
would
have
the
highest
legal
officer
appearing
in
federal
court
on
behalf
of
the
state
and
representations
that
that
person
makes
count
for
nothing?
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--then
what
was
the
attorney...
then
the
attorney
general
was
really
deceiving
the
federal
court
when
the
attorney
general
said,
this
is
a
consent
decree
that
we
worked
out,
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
it.
now,
if
the
attorney
general
had
no
authority
to
enter
that
consent
decree,
he
should
have
told
that
to
the
federal
court,
but
there
was
no...
no
such
representation.
unknown
speaker
but
nothing
required
the
state
to
agree
to
this
consent
decree.
i
know
you
distinguished
the
case...
lapides
was...
you
said
that
they...
the
state
made
the
move
to
get
the
case
into
the
federal
court.
but
here,
yes,
the
state
is
a
defendant.
nothing
in
the
world
compelled
it
to
enter
the
consent
decree,
to
urge
the
court
to
accept
its
consent.
so
when
a
state
attorney
general
says
to
the
federal
judge,
federal
judge,
we
think
this
is
a
sound
decree,
we
want
you
to
enter
it,
that's
hardly
being
hauled
before
the
court.
that's
a
voluntary
decision.
unknown
speaker
in
gunter,
the
state
was
also
hailed
involuntarily
before
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
prevented
it
from
happening
by
entering
into
the
consent
decree.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
they
filed
a
lawsuit
they
didn't
think
they
could
win?
unknown
speaker
it
was
filed
in
good
faith
alleging
violations
of
federal
law,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
then
why
enter
a
consent
decree?
it
just
doesn't
make
sense.
i
assume
that
whatever
counsel
was
representing
the
state
at
that
time
thought
there
was
sufficient
grounds
to
justify
entering
into
a
consent
decree,
unless
you
want
to
take
the
position
that
the
attorney
was
acting
totally
ultra
vires.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
you're
saying
then
that
the
consent
decree
is
basically
a
continuance.
unknown
speaker
right.
we'll
see...
a
consent
decree
means
we'll
see
you
later.
unknown
speaker
only
with
the
state
attorney
general.
[laughter]
you
haven't
made
another
argument
that...
that
i
thought
you...
you
would
make,
and
that
is
not
applicable
to
the
waiver
argument,
which
requires
that
the
state
attorney
general
or
someone
authorized
to
act
for
the
state
is
there.
what...
what
troubles
me
about...
about
the
non-waiver
argument
made
by
the
petitioner
is
that
some
of
these
consent
decrees
are
imposed
upon...
upon
absolutely
willing
state
officers
who
want
to
be
thrown
into
the
briar
patch.
a
suit
is
brought
against
a...
a
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
in
the
state
who
absolutely
wants
to
do
these
wonderful
things
for
pediatric
care
that
are
not
required
by
federal
law.
and
if
the
state
attorney
general
were
not
in
the
situation,
i
am
very
reluctant
to
think
that
this
official
can
go
in
and
say,
yes,
require
me
to
do
these
wonderful
things
that
state
law
does
not
require,
that
federal
law
does
not
require,
but
that
i
would
like
to
do,
signs
the
consent
decree,
and
then
we're
stuck.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
this
situation.
your
attorney
general
appeared
and
said,
this
is
okay
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
unknown
speaker
well,
surely
they
had
attorneys,
state
attorneys,
representing
them,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
cruz.
ms.
zinn,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
would
a
change
in
administrations
be
a
change
of
circumstances
that...
that
justifies
60(b)
being
invoked?
unknown
speaker
is
there
then
a
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
justice
scalia
raised,
which
is
a
serious
problem
i
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
they
do
is
they
go
examine
this
decree
and
there
all
kinds
of
things
in
the
decree
that
may
be
very
nice
and
really
helpful
to
people,
but
actually
the
legislature
would
never
pass
them,
and
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
federal
law.
now,
what
he's
looking
for
is
a
remedy
for
that
situation.
i'm
not
saying
your
decree
has
that
problem.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
known
problem,
and
what's
your
solution
to
it?
