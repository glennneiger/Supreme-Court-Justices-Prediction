mr.
r.
ted
cruz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
basic
question
whether
federal
district
courts
are
immune
from
the
strictures
of
sovereign
immunity
and
ex
parte
young
when
administering
federal
consent
decrees.
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
what
federal
law
requires.
the
medicaid
statute
is
very
clear
and
everything
that
federal
law
requires,
the
state
of
texas
is
doing.
the
dispute
that
the
parties
are
having
here
is
not
simply
a
theoretical
dispute
about
whether...
what
degree
of
connection
there
should
be
between
a
remedy
and...
and
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law.
there
is
no
violation
of
federal
law,
and
that
fundamentally
is
the
problem.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
and
no
court
has
determined
that.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
under
ex
parte
young,
the
question
is
not
retrospectively
was
there
a
violation
of
federal
law,
but...
but--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--there
is
a
strong
argument
that
there
was
not
a
violation
of
federal
law
at
the
time
the
litigation
commenced,
but
that
matter
was
never
adjudicated
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
what
the
state
did
is
pursue
an
option
to
settle
the...
the
matter
and
avoid
an
adjudication.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
we
would
agree
that
this
case
was
initially
properly
brought
under
ex
parte
young
in
that
the
complaint,
under
the
terms
of
the
verizon
decision,
alleged
a
violation
of
federal
law.
however,
ex
parte
young
is
not
simply
a
formulistic
pleading
requirement.
it
also
is...
is,
under
this
court's
decision
in,
among
other
things,
green
v.
mansour,
a
restriction
on
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
that...
that
what
there
would
have
to
be
for
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
to
carry
through
is
not
simply
a
determination
that
there
might
be
a
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
no,
your
honor.
but
in
order
for
the
court
now
to
exercise
the
coercive
authority
of
the
federal
court
and
to
order
the
state
officials
to
engage
in
a
very
detailed
course
of
conduct,
the
predicate
that
justifies
the
young
fiction
in
the
first
place
is
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if
the
agreement
was--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
consent
decree
offered
the
other
side
a
great
deal.
for
one
thing,
the
state,
as
a
voluntary
agreement,
agreed
to
carry
out
an
extensive
course
of
conduct.
and
if
you
look
at
the
actual
record--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
ginsburg,
we're...
we're
making
both
distinctions.
this
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
if
there
had
been...
it
had
been
litigated
and
there
had
been
a
determination
of
a
violation
of
federal
law,
but--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
would
be
more
difficult
because
you
at
least
had
the
predicate
for
ex
parte
young
in
the
first
place.
you
had
a
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it...
it
is
absolutely
a
federal
judgment,
but
on
the
terms
of
the
consent
decree,
there
was
no
concession
of
liability.
no
court
at
any
time
has
ever
found
the
state
of
texas
was
violating
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
essence--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
second
part
of
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
about
whether
even
if
this
were
fully
adjudicated,
would
this
content...
consent
decree
be
proper,
the
answer
is
plainly
no
because
this
consent
decree
does
not
enjoin
ongoing
violations
of
federal
law.
there
are
a
number
of
provisions
in
this
consent
decree--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--absolutely.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
absolutely.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
under
milliken,
the
question
would
be
the
relation--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--our
answer
is
going
to
be
that
the...
the
jurisdiction
that
this
court
has
created
under
ex
parte
young
and
its
progeny
exists
for
one
purpose,
to
vindicate
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if
c
and
d
were
necessary
to
ensure
compliance
with
federal
law,
then
they
would
be
permissible
remedies
once
there
was
a
finding
under
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if
there's
an
ongoing
injunction--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--if
the
injunction
is
ongoing,
then
the
state
officials
could
come
in
at
any
point
and
say,
c,
d,
and
e
are
not
necessary--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
breyer,
two
responses.
first
of
all,
there
was
not
an
agreement
that
there
was
a
violation
of
federal
law.
it's
certainly
true
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--consent
decree
explicitly--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
second
response...
your...
your
question
refers
to
volumes
of
federal
law
and
state
law
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
violated.
this
case
is
very
simple.
it's
one
short
section
of
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer,
the
exercise
of
requiring
a...
a
violation
of
federal
law
derives
from
this
court's
cases
beginning
with
ex
parte
young
and
moving
on.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer,
under
the
fifth
circuit
precedent,
the
means
to
challenge
this
sort
of
decree
is
precisely
what
we
did,
to
challenge
it.
under
the
lelsz
v.
kavanagh
case,
the
means
to
challenge
it
is
to
challenge
the
enforcement
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well,
you
can,
and
that's
the
second
part
which
is
the
fifth
circuit
treated
what
we
did
as
a
motion
to
modify
or
vacate
the
decree.
that's
how
the
fifth
circuit
interpreted
what
we
did.
the...
the
plaintiffs
came
at
a
year
and
a
half--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
is
true
that
treating
our...
our
argument
as
a
motion
to
modify
is
not
purely
based
upon
changed
facts
and
law.
it
is
in
part
because
you
have
the
2
years
of
compliance
and
the
tremendous
record
the
state
has,
but
another
fundamental
element
of
it
was
a
challenge
that
the
terms
of
the
consent
decree
go
far
beyond
what
federal
law
requires.
and
let
me
focus
just
for
a
moment--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--my...
my--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--my
hope--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--my...
my
hope
would
be--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--my
hope
would
be
to
make
virtues
out
of
either
approach
and
to
say
that
it
could
either
be
done
on...
under
an
effort
to
modify
or
a
challenge
of
enforcement,
that
either
avenue
is
available.
and
the
fifth
circuit
treated
it
as
both.
i
mean,
that's
precisely
what
the
fifth
circuit
did.
the...
the--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well,
we
don't
know
what
the
circumstances
were
when...
when
this
matter
was
entered
because
there
was
no
adjudication
on
the
merits.
but
we
do
know
now--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--if
those...
they
did,
and
if
those
allegations
were
true,
then
there
are
changed
circumstances
because
the
district
court
was
very
clear
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
even
a
single
class
member
has
ever
requested
services
and
been
denied.
and
that
really
is
the
nub
of
the
dispute
because
petitioner--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but...
but
that
really
is
the
critical
dispute
because
the
statute,
the
medicaid
statute--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that's
possible,
and
so
this
could
be
fairly
characterized
as
a
motion
to
modify
because
there
is
not
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law
now.
what
the
federal
law
requires
is
that
whenever
an
eligible
member
requests
screening,
they
receive
it.
petitioners
don't
like
that
reading
and
what
the
petitioners
convinced
the
federal
district
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
read
the
words
where
they
are
requested
out
of
the
statute.
and
all
of
this
fight
about
what
the
proper
baseline
is,
is
it
federal
law
or
is
it
the
consent--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--yes.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
treated
what
we
did.
so
we--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
will
prevail
either
way.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if...
if
what
we
did
is
deemed
that,
because--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it's
not
a
bit
beyond
and...
and
one
important
caveat
of
60(b)
is
most
of
this
court's
60(b)
cases
are
in
a
context
where
the
state
or
a
state
official
is
not
a
defendant.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it
is.
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it...
it
did.
rufo
was
easing
the
standards
for
modification,
and
rufo
did
not
address
the
eleventh
amendment.
that
was
not
an
issue
that
was
litigated,
and
the
court--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
don't
necessarily
concede
that
the
court
should
have
entered
this
decree,
but
the
point
at
which
we
litigated
it
is
the
point
at
which
the
federal
court
began
to
exercise
coercive
authority
of
a
federal
court
over
the
state.
and
at
that
point--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
what--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
did
say
that.
we
argued
extensively
that
we
were
carrying
out
our
promises.
and
that
actually
highlights
a
point.
one
thing
petitioners
argue
a
great
deal
is
the
unfairness,
and
that
was
a
motivating
factor
in
this
court's
lapides
decision.
but
i
would
point
out
petitioners
did
not
give
anything
up
when
they
signed
this
agreement.
it's
not
as
if
we
could
sign
an
agreement
with
them
and
agree
we're
going
to
comply
with
80
percent
of
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
scalia,
they
accomplished
a
number
of
things.
one,
the
state
voluntarily
engaged
in
a
number
of
changes
as
a
result
of
that
agreement.
two--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
state
officials
endeavored
to
improve
the
program--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
the
decree
was
drafted
as
an
effort
to
end
this...
this
litigation.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
your
honor,
that
actually
opens
the
door
to
yet
another
reason
why
we
do
not
believe
this
court
should
hold
that
ex
parte
young
defendants
can
engage
in
commitments
that
extend
far
beyond
federal
law
because
that
open...
opens
a
pandora's
box
to
separation
of
powers
problems.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
kennedy,
no
body
of
law,
federal
or
state
law,
requires
virtually
everything
that's
in
the
consent
decree.
the
consent
decree
requires
data
collection,
and
there's
no
reference
to
that
in
federal
law.
the
consent
decree
requires
the
state
officials--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
mean,
the
consent
decree--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
consent
decree
requires
that
the
state
officials
train
private
health
care
workers
in
cultural
sensitivity.
now,
that's
not
required
by
federal
law.
that's
not
necessarily
to
ensure
compliance
with
federal
law.
it
is
something
quite
simply--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
federal
law
requires--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--a
state
official
does
not
have
the
right
to
bargain
away
his
or
her
constitutional
authority
or
the
legislature's.
if
one
might
imagine
a
hypothetical.
the
legislature--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
scalia--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
scalia,
the
premise
of
the
question
that
the
attorney
general
had
power
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
is
not
correct
under
texas
law.
now,
it
is
admittedly
a
question
of
federal
law,
but
federal
law
looks
to
state
law.
in
answer
to
your
question
about
waiver,
we
have
seven
reasons
why
we
believe
the
court
should
not
find
that
there
was
a
waiver.
first,
that
this
was
waived
below.
secondly,
there's
no
clear
and
unambiguous
waiver,
as
this
court's
decisions
require.
thirdly,
there
has
been
no
waiver
by
the
legislature
of
immunity
from
liability
in
state
court,
a
critical
predicate
for
lapides,
and
in
fact,
the
united
states
in
lapides
argued
that
all
the
attorney
general
could
waive
was
forum
immunity,
not
immunity
from
liability...
immunity
from
suit
at
all.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
ginsburg,
your...
your
hypothetical
is
in
fact
the
law
in
the
texas,
in
that
the
legislature
has
explicitly
said
the
attorney
general
may
not
waive
sovereign
immunity
in
government
code
402.004.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
ginsburg,
the
attorney
general
didn't
deceive
the
court
because
the
attorney
general
never
represented
that
this
was
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
those
words
are
not
found
in
the
consent
decree.
the
consent
decree
says
the
defendants'
defenses
are
all
preserved.
this
was
an
effort,
unlike
all
of
the
voluntary
invocation
of
jurisdiction
cases,
where
the
state
makes
an
affirmative
decision,
we
want
to
be
in
federal
court.
in
this
case
the
state
was
hailed
involuntarily--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
state
acted
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
a
long,
protracted
litigation.
we
were
hailed
involuntarily
before
the
federal
court.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
gunter
was
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
and
found
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law
and
then
enjoined
that
ongoing
violation.
had
that
happened,
we
wouldn't
have
a
dispute.
we
don't--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
that
could
have
happened
at
the
stage
of
enforcement.
before
a
federal
court
orders
a
state
to
do
something,
this
court
has
said
that
ex
parte
young
is
a
fiction,
that...
that
the
courts
will
pretend
the
state
official,
who
is
not
really
a
state
official,
is
acting
ultra
vires
for
the
limited
purpose
of
vindicating
the
supremacy
clause.
that
limited
purpose
is
not
served
when
no
court
has
ever
found
a
violation
of
federal
law,
and
when
there
is
in
fact
not
a
violation
of
federal
law.
the
reasons
petitioners
are
litigating
today
is
because
if
they
had
to
demonstrate
a
violation
of
federal
law,
they
could
not
do
so.
so
what
they
would,
instead,
like
is
for
the
baseline
to
be
the
consent
decree.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
they
filed
a
lawsuit
that
was
filed
before
judge
william
wayne
justice--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
was...
it...
we
presume
it
was
filed
in
good
faith
and
it
alleged
violations
of
federal
law.
we
don't
believe
they
could
have
demonstrated
then
and
we...
we
absolutely
don't
believe
they
can
demonstrate
now
any
violations
of
federal
law.
both
the
district
court
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
was
an
effort
to
end
the
litigation.
it
was
an
effort
that
ultimately
failed.
i
mean,
there...
there
are
two
additional
key
reasons
why
there's
not
waiver.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it
is
a
voluntary
agreement
and
it
allows...
it
agrees
that
the
district
court
is
available,
it's
familiar
with
the
law
and
facts
and
can...
the
case
can
be
brought
back
to
it
if
there's
ongoing
dispute.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
or
we'll
agree
to
this
and
that
will
resolve
the
matter.
i
will
point
out
if
signing
a
consent
decree
is
a
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
or
sovereign
immunity,
then
plaintiffs'
argument
proves
too
much.
it
means
every
consent
decree
is
utterly
immune
from
ex
parte
young.
it
means
once
a
consent
decree
is
there,
the
requirements
of
federal
law
don't
matter.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but...
but
that
is
a
fundamental
problem
with
these
cases.
it
was
a
prior
attorney
general,
a
prior
head
of
the
health
department,
and
those
prior
officers
under
petitioners'
theory
had
bargained
away
the
legislature's
authority.
it's
clear
the
legislature
couldn't
pass
a
statute
that
said,
we're
going
to
allow
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
texas
to
run
our
medicaid
program.
that
would
be
a
fundamental
violation
of

nor
could
the
attorney
general
sign
a
contract
to
do
that.
therefore,
they
should
not
be
able
to
sign
a
consent
decree
to
do
that
unless
it
is
necessitated
by
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law.
it
is
only
the
supremacy
clause
that
justifies
that.
in
addition,
this
course's
voluntary...
this
court's
voluntary
invocation

jurisdiction
cases
have,
by
and
large,
not
been
ex
parte
young
cases.
in
lapides,
in
gardner,
in
clark,
they
were
suits
against
the
state.
they
were
not
ex
parte
young
cases,
and
this
court
would
be
breaking
new
ground
by
saying
an
ex

young
defendant
who,
under
the
legal
fiction,
is
not
the
state,
is
simultaneously
the
state
for
purpose
of
being
able
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
by
litigating.
and
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
earlier
colloquy,
the
state
was
a
defendant,
raised
the
eleventh
amendment,
was
dismissed
on
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity.
and
to
say
now
that
ambiguous
and
conflicting
provisions
of
the
consent
decree,
signed
by
the
state
officials
as
ex
parte
young
defendants,
can
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
is
to
extend
the
ex

young
fiction
beyond--

--they...
they
did,
mr.
chief

but
those
attorneys,
just
like
the
state
officials,
are
temporary
officeholders,
and
temporary
officeholders
are
in
effect,
as
this
court
recognized
in
alden
v.
maine
and
also
in
justice
thomas'
and
justice
o'connor's
opinions
in
missouri
v.
jenkins,
there
are
serious
separation
of
powers
issues
that
are
raised
when
one
official
bargains
away
the
authority
of
another.
