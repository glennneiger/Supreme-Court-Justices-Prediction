ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
sovereign
immunity
should
not
bar
enforcement
of
the
consent
decree
in
this
case
for
two
reasons.
first,
when
state
officials
ask
a
district
court
to
enter
a
consent
decree,
they
submit
their
rights
concerning
the
decree
for
judicial
determination,
thereby
waiving
any
possible
claim
for
objection
on
the
basis
of
immunity.
second,
the
decree
in
this
case
provides
prospective
relief
to
protect
the
supremacy
of
federal
law,
exactly
as
envisioned
by
ex
parte
young.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
no,
it's
not
immaterial.
the...
texas'
attorney
general
is
authorized
by
the
legislature
to
represent
the
state
and
its
employees--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--unrepresented
by
the
state
attorney
general.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
fact
and
a
matter
of
law,
your
honor.
the
question
under
this
court's
decision
recently
in
lapides
would
be
whether
those
officials
are
authorized
to
represent
the
state
in
court,
even
absent
their
attorney.
that
would
be
so
unusual
in
texas
i
can't
imagine
it
even
happening,
but--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--under
our
second
argument,
our
position
is
that
since
the
decree
is
a
remedy
ordered
in
a
valid
ex
parte
young
case,
it
provides
prospective
relief
only
from
alleged
ongoing
violations
of
federal
law.
the...
the
remedy
is
proper.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
correct.
the
eleventh
amendment
is
not
engaged
for
that...
for
that--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--in...
in
this
case--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--yes,
your
honor.
the...
the
lodging
has
the...
as
its
last
page,
the
order
to
correct
the
consent
decree
which
states
that
the...
the
order
was...
the
unopposed
motion
to...
to
correct
the
consent
decree
has
merit
and
should
be
granted.
the
decree
was
entered
as
the
court's
order
in
february
of
1996.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
the
same
parties--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--the
same
parties
were
before
the
court
for
the
entire
case
with
the
exception
of
two
state
agencies
which
were
dismissed
early
on.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
our
position,
as
well
recognized
apparently,
is
that
this
is
an
ex
parte
young
case.
however,
the
state
officials
in
their
briefing
have
urged
that
that
is
not
correct
and
that
this...
this,
at
least
in
part,
is
not
a
valid
order
under
ex
parte
young.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
correct.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
correct,
and
they
were
unanimous.
the...
all
of
the
state
officials
and
their
lawyer
were
unanimous
in
requesting
the
district
court
to
enter
the
consent
decree.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
correct.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
in
our...
in
our
view
both
positions
are
clear
in
this
case.
the...
the--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--no.
in
lapides,
it
appeared
to...
to
be
a
question
of
law.
the
issue--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--but
in
lapides,
it
appeared
to
me
that
that
was
resolved
fairly
simply
based
on
the
application
of
federal
law
to
the
state--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--yes,
which
was
determined
by
an
examination
of
the
state
statutes
involved.
and
the
texas
law
on
that
point
is
almost
word
for
word
the
same
as
the...
the
georgia
constitutional
provisions--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--but--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--i
do
too,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
that's
correct.
the...
one
way
to
look
at
this
is
that
given
the
texas
attorney
general's
argument
that
this
is
not
an
ex
parte
young
case,
not
a
valid
order
under
ex
parte
young,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
agrees
with
that,
those
points
have
been
waived
because
by
asking
the
district
court
to
enter
the
consent
decree,
the
state
officials
submitted
their
rights
concerning
the
decree
for
judicial
determination.
and
by
doing
that--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--yes.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
no.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
well--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--because
under
this
court's
traditional
rules
concerning
equitable
decrees,
even
a
disputed
injunction
need
not
be
specifically
tied
to
the
provisions
of
law
for
the--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--the
question
of
the
scope
of
remedy
is
a
different
question
from
the
eleventh
amendment/ex
parte
young
question.
the
ex
parte
young
question
is
a
jurisdictional
question,
but
the
question
of
the
scope
of
proper
remedy--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--for
example,
damages?
would
that
fit
within
your
hypothetical?
because
in
that
case
without
waiver,
no.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
the...
the
validity
of
consent
decree
should
be...
as
in
an
ex
parte
young
case,
should
be
measured
under
this...
this
court's
decision,
for
example,
in
milliken
and
rufo.
milliken
says
that
the
remedy
must
tend
to
or
to
remedy
the
violation
proven.
and
rufo
says
that
when
you
have
a
consent
decree,
it
may
aim
even
higher
than
that.
because
in
the
course
of--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--milliken
involved
a
state
official,
and
it's
one
of
the
key
cases
about
the
scope
of
disputed
injunctions.
and
it
says
that
remedial
orders
may
go
beyond
the
exact
scope,
the
precise
scope
of
the
violation
at
issue.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
correct.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
correct.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
correct.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
yes.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
yes.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
milliken.
hutto
v.
finney
would
be
another
example.
a
district
court
need
not
sit
back
and
hope
that
the
state
officials
will
comply
with
its
proper
remedial
order.
it
can
enforce
that
order.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
well,
this
court's
decision
in
firefighters
generally
sets
out
standards
for
entry
of
a
consent
decree,
and
a
decree
is
properly
entered,
as
this
one
was
found
to
be,
if
it
furthers...
if
it
serves
to
resolve
a
dispute
within
the
court's
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
case
here...
this
is
a
federal
question
about
the
medicaid
act...
if
it
is
generally
within
the
scope
of
the
pleadings,
which
is
true
in
this
case,
and
if
the
remedy
in
the
decree
serves
to
further
the
objectives
of
the...
in
this
case,
the
medicaid
act,
which
is
true
about
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
decree
in
this
case.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
that's
correct.
our
position
is
that
the
district
court
could
have
entered
this...
this
decree
as
a
disputed
injunction
if
the
state
officials
had
not
decided
to
consent.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
well,
i'd
hate
to
put
words
into
mr.
cruz's
mouth.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
but
i
believe
that
is
part
of
their
claim.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
some
of
the
arguments
made
are
not
tethered
in...
tethered
or
tied
to
the
record
in
this
case.
the
district
court,
before
enforcing
the
consent
decree,
found
violations
of...
ongoing
violations
of
federal
law.
that
finding
is
found
at
pages...
at
the
bottom
of
page
272
and
273
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition.
and
it...
it
refers
and
relies
on
the
court's
earlier
extensive
findings
of
fact.
second,
there
has
been
no
contested
motion
to
modify
filed
in
this
case.
there
was
no
contested
motion
to
modify
pending
before
the
district
court
or
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
is
an
important
matter
for
this
court
to
consider.
of
course,
a
motion
to
modify
would
allow
state
officials
to
present
legitimate
concerns,
if
they
have
any,
concerning
the
consent
decree
to
the
district
court
so
that
the
district...
with
them
having
the
burden
of
proof,
so
that
they
could
have
their
best
shot
to
show
the
district
court
what's
wrong
with
the
consent
decree
under
this
court's
decision
in
rufo.
that...
that
burden
of
proof
gives
the
district
court
a
full
record
to
base
its
decision
on
about
whether
or
not
to
modify
the
decree
and
it
also
creates
an
adequate
record
for
appellate
review
of
those
questions,
which
is
not
present
at
the
moment.
indeed--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--no.
indeed--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--if
a
change
in...
in
administrations
results
in--
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
--yes.
ms.
susan
finkelstein
zinn
as
has
been
pointed
out,
rufo
does
create
a
more
flexible
standard
for
modification
when
consent
decrees
are
involved
in
institutional
reform
litigation
of
this
type.
that
flexibility,
though,
does
not
sink
down
to
the
level
of
mere
inconvenience.
so
just
because
it
becomes
inconvenient
for
a
successor
administration
to
comply
with
the
consent
decree
is
not
justification
for
modification.
but
if
the...
the
new
state
officials
can
bring
legitimate
concerns
to
the
district
court's
attention,
modification
may
be
appropriate.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
there's
no
further
reply.
