justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
indeed.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the
reves
case
was
dictum,
and
the
question
here
is,
are
we
going
to
turn
that
dictum
into
a
holding?
and
before
we
get
to
a
holding
i
think
you've
got
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
when
we
have
specific
examples
of...
of...
of
fixed
returns,
why
should
the
general
proposition
investment
contract
somehow
be
held
not
to
include
as
a
generality
a
fixed
return
contract?
justice
david
h.
souter
let...
let
me...
i...
i
don't
want
to
be...
be
short
with
you,
but
i
don't
think
you're
getting
at
what
he
and
i
want.
we...
we
have
examples
in
which
the
fixed
returns
securities
are
specifically
listed.
why...
let's
be
specific...
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
exclude
this
kind
of
a
scheme?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
being
marketed
as
a
classic
investment
scheme.
why
would
it
have
wanted
to
exclude
this
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
a...
a
normal
commercial
lease.
it's
a...
it's
a
commercial
lease
of
an
essentially
trivial
piece
of
property,
which
is
replicated
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
times.
it
is
marketed
on...
on
the
theory
that
you're
going
to
get
an
extraordinarily
generous
rate
of
interest.
these
are...
these
are
not
classic
sale
and
lease-back
contracts.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
being
marketed
not
to
people
who
want
to
go
into
the
lease
business,
but
people
who
want
to
invest
their
money
and
sit
back
at
home
and
get
at
return.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
it
is
not
denied.
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
exclude
this
kind
of
fixed
return
transaction
when
it
is
classically
being
marketed
as
an
investment?
justice
david
h.
souter
have
you
ever
held
a
bond
when
interest
rates
were
going
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
have
learned
what
an
investment
risk
was.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
means
that
it
is
more
than
a
mere
credit
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
anyone
who
buys
a
bond
with
the
possible
expectation
of
selling
before
maturity
assumes
exactly
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
isn't
your
argument
equally
applicable
to
notes?
we've
been
through
that
in
reves.
i
mean,
you
could
have
argued
in
reves,
my
god,
are
you
going
to
cover
every
note.
you're
making
the
same
argument
here
with
investment...
investment
contract,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
justice
breyer
has
just
been
applying
a
family
resemblance
test
to
exclude
general
motors'
boxcar.
why
isn't
that
sort
of
thing
just
as
feasible
under
investment
contract
as
it
is
under
note?
