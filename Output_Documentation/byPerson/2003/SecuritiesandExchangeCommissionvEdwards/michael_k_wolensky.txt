mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
that
tells
us
two
things.
first
of
all,
commercial
leases
is
not
a
term
included
in
the
statute,
and
second
of
all,
the
term
investment
contract
is
undefined.
but
over
a
course
of
10
decisions
during
the
past
60
years,
this
court
has
identified
the
essential
attributes
of
investment
contracts.
it
has
identified
those,
defined
those,
and
explained
those.
one
of
the
essential
attributes
of
investment
contracts
is
a
return
of
profits.
the
court's
restrictive
definition
of
profits
in
the...
in
the
forman
case
and
then
reiterated
in
the
reves
case,
captures
very
effectively
the
investment
risk
and
investment
reward
characteristics...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
as
long
as
it
was
a
fixed
return,
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
under
the
sec's
explanation
in
its
briefs,
it
refers
to
a
lot
of
things
as
fixed
returns,
which
are
really
just
sham,
boastful
promises
by
promoters,
and
i
believe
that's
what
takes
this
situation
completely
out
of
what
the
sec
is
proposing.
both
parties
here
agree
that
the
correct
test
the
court
should
apply
is
the
howey
test.
there...
we
don't
disagree
on
that.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
that
is
correct.
that
test
would
never
cover
a
debt
securities
because
this
court
has
defined
profits
for
howey
test
purposes
to
mean
an
expectation
of
profits
from
earning...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
investment
risk,
your
honor.
that
is
the
key.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
there
really
wasn't,
because
what
you
have
is
a
commercial
lease
arrangement,
a
telephone
acts
as
the
collateral,
so
to
speak,
to
use
this
court's
words
from
the
reves
case,
but
you
have
a
commercial
lease
arrangement
like
commercial
lease
arrangements
done
throughout
the
country...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
it
did...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
it
can
be
characterized
that
way,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
a
credit
risk,
not
an
investment
risk.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
preferred
stock
is
an...
has
both
investment
risk,
because
it
can
have
fluctuating
values,
some
do.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
debt
can
if
there's
a
market
for
the
debt.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
but
the
investor...
that's
correct...
but
the
characterization
of
the
return
to
the
investor
in
debt
is
generally
viewed
as...
as
a
return,
the
interest
rate,
and
as
far
as
the
market...
market...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
preferred
stock,
but
it's
a
capital
appreciation
issue
and
that's
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
that's
right,
but
that's
capital
appreciation
and
we
don't
have
capital
appreciation
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
that's
correct,
and
a
bond
is
a
fixed
return
instrument.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
it's
a
specifically
designated
type
of
security
by
congress.
it
is
not...
it
does
not
fall
under
the
investment
contract
rubric.
it
may
vary
in
its
value
and
have
capital
appreciation...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
without
question,
it
did,
but
congress
and...
and
this
court
has
stated
very
clearly,
certainly
in
the
reves
case...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
our
position
is
that
investment
contract
is
an
equity-type
security,
and
we
think
that
is
founded
on
all
of
the
history
and
when
congress
used
the
term
investment
contract...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
because...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
because
this
is
a...
this
is
a
commercial
lease.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
i...
i
disagree
with
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is
a
legitimate
lease.
there's
never
been
a
question
that
it's
not
an
enforceable
lease.
there's
never
been
a
question
that
the
telephone
didn't
have
the
value
ascribed
to
it.
it
was
fairly
valued.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
that
may
be
true,
but
it
cannot
be
denied
that
in
fact
there
was
a
lease
agreement.
every
witness
who
testified
or
provided
a
declaration
in
connection
with
the
case
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
lease.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
there
were
leases
that
were
being
used
for
commercial
purposes
in
1933.
lease
financing
was
being
used
on
very
significant
items
then
in
the
railroad
area
and
other
areas,
but
leases
are
not
new,
novel,
or
unusual.
investment
contract
was
designed,
as
this
court
has
said...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
justice
o'connor,
the...
the
only
answer
i
can
give
is
because
it
does
not
have
investment
risk.
it's...
it
is
excluded
from
the
term
investment
contract
because
it
doesn't
have
investment
risk.
all
of
the
pre-33
act
cases...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
that's
a
credit
risk...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
when
the...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
justice
scalia...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
the...
the
money
that
was
lost
was
lost
as
a
result
of
a
bankruptcy
and
what
occurred
in
the
bankruptcy,
but
when
the
bankruptcy
was
filed,
these
phone
owners
still
owned
their
telephones
and
they
were
still
entitled
to
their
lease
payments.
that
was
dealt
with
in
the
bankruptcy
and
the
details
of
that
are
not
involved
in
the
record
here
but
in...
there's
a...
a
significant
difference
between
investment
risk,
which
this
court
characterized
in
forman
and
recognized
from
the
valic
case,
is
a
matter
of
fluctuating
value
generally.
when
you
look
at
credit
risk
you're...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
a
person
who
buys
a
bond
takes
a
credit
risk,
not
an
investment
risk.
there
is
a
difference,
and
i
believe...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
it...
it
is
an
investment,
but
it...
it
is
not
the
type
of
investment
risk
that
you
see
in
fluctuating
values
securities
or
equity
securities.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
i...
i
agree...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
justice
souter,
i
agree
that
bonds
can
fluctuate
in
value
and
that
deals
with
a
capital
appreciation...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
to
the
extent
you
were
looking
to
the
bond
to
return
a
value
and...
and
hold
it
for
purposes
of
changing
value,
it
theoretically
could.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
they
are
going
to
face
that
risk
and
that...
that
is,
in
fact,
an
investment
risk.
but
the
key
here,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
fact
that
you
do
have
a
lease
agreement,
that
is
what
it
is
involved
here.
it
is
a
legitimate
lease
agreement.
it
is
like
any
other
equipment
lease
agreement
and
it
is
going
to
be
dealt
with
under
state
law.
there
is
also
a
significant
issue
here
with
respect
to
the
coverage
of
other
regulatory
agencies.
we
have
in
fact
federal
trade
commission
coverage
here.
there's
no
question
about
that.
it
is
involved...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
the...
the
challenge
i
make
is
that
before
1933
the
state
blue
sky
laws
that
were...
cases
that
were
incorporated
and
mentioned
in
joiner
and
in
howey
were
variable
return
cases.
i
disagree
with
the
sec
on
the
two
cases.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
as
of
today,
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
i
see
in
the
amici
brief
and
i
have
no
reason
to
question
that.
the
way
the
law
has
developed
under
state
law,
it
would
include
fixed
returns,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
justice
ginsburg,
this
court
has...
has
repeated
that
over
and
over.
i
will
agree
with
that,
but
the
court
has
talked
about
new,
novel,
and
unusual
schemes.
there
is
nothing
new,
novel,
or
unusual
about
lease
agreements
and
commercial
leases,
and
what
you
have
to
focus
on
here
is
what
the
court
has
said.
it
has
given
guidance.
it
has
said
that
unanimously...
it
may
have
a
been
a
footnote
in
reves,
but
certainly...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
justice
ginsburg,
in
forman,
the
court
had
to
address
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
an
investment
contract
involved,
and
it
stated
what
i
would
call
the
forman
formulation
of
profits
in
connection
with
doing
that
analysis
on
the
three
types
of
profits
that
allegedly...
or
that
had
been
found
and
allegedly
were
present
in
the
second
circuit
decision,
and
it
applied
that
formulation
to
each
one
of
those.
so
it
was...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
then
in
reves,
it
was
dealing
with
the
distinction
between
equity
and
debt.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
it
was
not,
but
when
you
read
the...
justice
kennedy,
when
you
read
what
the
court
said
in
forman,
it's
talking
about
an
expectation
of
profits
or
capital
appreciation,
and
those
are
two
variable
forms.
they're
not...
they're
not
fixed.
they
necessarily
vary
with
the
marketplace.
if
i
can
finish
answering
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect
to
reves,
there
was
a
distinction,
a
very
specific
distinction
there,
between
fixed
and...
and
variable.
that's
what
that
case
was
about,
investment
contract
versus
note.
and
the
eighth
circuit
had
decided
that
the
investment
contract
case
of...
that
the
investment
contract
test
of
howey
would
apply
to
notes.
there
were
a
series
of
tests
and
this
court
used
the
reves
opinion
to...
to
go
through
those
and
decide,
and
it
came
up
with
a
family
resemblance
test
that
had
been
used
by
the
second
circuit.
in
the
footnote
in
reves,
it
is
very
clear
that
what
the
court
is
doing
is
distinguishing
and
explaining
why
howey
does
not
apply
to
notes,
which
are
fixed
instruments.
i
think
it
is
not
just
a
passing
reference
and
it...
it
was
unanimously
stated
that...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
the
meaning
of
investment
contract
was
not
at
issue,
but
distinguishing
investment
contract
was
at
issue
in
reves,
and
explaining
why
it
was
not
applicable
in
that
case.
the
parties
briefed
the
issue,
the
sec
briefed
the
issue
as
amicus
took
the
same
position
it...
it
has
taken
here,
and
the
court
in
reves
said
that
is
not
the
position
we
accept.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
if
i
can
address...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
if
i
can
address
that
for
just
a
moment,
justice
scalia...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
thank
you,
sir.
with
respect
to
the
very
long
time,
if
you
go
back
to
the
case
the
sec
has
pointed
to
a
number
of
times,
the
universal
service
case
from
1939
in
the
seventh
circuit,
when
you...
and
the
sec
talks
about
its
position
in
that
case...
its
position
in
that
case
was
stated
in
its
brief
in
that
case,
and
when
you
look
at
its
brief
in
that
case,
it
recognizes
that
it
is
not
dealing
with
a
fixed
return
as
we
would
talk
about
it.
in
fact,
in
the
brief,
the
sec
says
the
amount
ultimately
credited
to
the
contributor's
account,
the
amount
itself
being
dependent
upon
the
degree
of
success
attending
the
venture...
and
i'm
reading
from
pages
39
and
40
and
footnote
10...
with
respect
to
the
abbett,
sommer
case,
which
is
a
19...
i
believe
62
decision...
by
the
sec,
the
sec
admitted
in
abbett,
sommer
that
it
wasn't
looking
at
traditional
profits
analysis.
that
was
a
mortgage
loan
servicing
case
and
they
said
that
what
was
being
offered
there
was
not
just
the
repayment
on
the
notes
but
also
the
services,
and
they
found
that
the
reduction
of
risk
in
that
case
was
the...
basically
the
profit.
so
they
departed
from
what
is
a
normal
profit
analysis
and
that's
freely
admitted.
in
the
interpretative
release
they've
issued,
the
multi-level
release
under
the
33
act,
number
5211,
in
there
the
sec
admits
that
howey
is
an
equity-type
test.
they
specifically
say
that.
so
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
history
of
what
this
court
has
done
and
what
the
sec
has
done,
when
you
get
to...
when
you
get
to
reves
and
when
you
get
to
forman,
it
is...
there's
no
ambiguity
left
as
to
what
is
meant
by
profits
at
that
point.
so
i
think
a
position...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
that
is
correct,
but
in
the
very
same
area
of
the
opinion
is
where
the
court
says
by
profits
in
the
howey
analysis,
we
have
meant
a
participation
in
earnings
or
capital
appreciation,
citing
the
earlier
cases.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
the
fact
that
reves
concluded
what
it
did
about
forman's
requirements
would
tend
to
show
that
that's
really
what
forman
required.
the...
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
was
not
free
to
disregard
what
was
a
unanimous
statement
by
this
court.
this
court
obviously
can
change
its
opinion
or
change
its
view,
but
there
is
no
compelling
reason
to
depart
from
what
has
been
accepted
for
25
years.
other
courts
of
appeals...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
justice
ginsburg,
because
this
court
has
said
more
than
once,
every
fraud
is
not
a
securities
fraud.
there
are
other
avenues
of
protection.
there
are
several
risk-reducing
factors
involved
in
these
leases.
the
leases
themselves
are
covered
by
state
law
in
the
uniform
commercial
code.
there's
other
regulatory
coverage,
other
agencies.
in
fact,
some
of
the
state
agencies
that
filed
amici
briefs
here
have
indicated
that
they
believe
they
have
coverage
of
those.
so
the
fact
that
the
federal
securities
laws
might
not
cover
this
doesn't
mean
that
there's
not
going
to
be
protection
of
the
public.
the
consequence,
and
i
think
it's
an
important
consequence
that
the
court
has
to
be
aware
of
here
if
it
agrees
with
the
sec's
position,
is
that
every
equipment
lease
can
be
brought
under
the
rubric
of
howey
if...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
the...
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
it
is
public
knowledge
and
information
that
is
available
that
some
$200
billion
of
equipment
leasing
occurs
every
year,
and
it...
equipment
leasing
involves
everything
from
telephone
systems
to
computers,
office
equipment.
it
is
a
very,
very
large
industry.
if
that
applies
to
this
large
industry...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
on...
justice
breyer,
there
are...
there
essentially
are
four
criteria
that
the...
that
the
sec
would
say
you
have
to
apply:
an
investment
of
money...
and
this
court
said
in
daniel
that
investment
of
money
doesn't
just
mean
money,
it
can
mean
services,
it
can
mean
assets
that's
why
we
say
in
analyzing
this
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
bring
your
phone
to
the
agreement
or
money
to
the
agreement,
but
if
you
put
equipment
into
a
lease
arrangement,
you
have
an
investment...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
i
can
contrast
that
and
agree
with
you
that
in
general
motors,
renting
a
railroad
car
is
part
of
its
business.
it
is
not
going
to
be
probably
found
to
run
afoul
of
the
securities
laws.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
general,
broad,
small
item
equipment
leases
will
be
covered
by
the
howey
test.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
whether
they're
in
business
or
not
in
business
the
securities
laws
would
still
cover
them
and
i
don't
believe
there's
an
exemption
that
would
be
available
for
the
ordinary
business.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
well,
not
necessarily.
i
think
the
court
did
set
forth
some
very
specific
criteria
in
reves.
the
family
resemblance
test
exempts
out
commercial
notes
that
have
credit
risk
and
not
investment
risk.
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
it
is,
and
if
you...
if
you
look
at
the
criteria
the
court
looked
to,
i
think
you
will
see
that
several
of
the
criteria
that
this
court
has
talked
about
indicate
that
this
would
not
be
covered.
i
believe
it
is...
it's
not
specifically
related,
but
the
court
noted
four
criteria,
and
if
you
apply
those
criteria,
i
think
you
find
that
they
in
fact...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
we
have
and...
and
i
was...
have
been
trying
to
address
the
question
that
was
presented
although
we
felt
a
different
question
was
involved.
this
court
for
60
years
has
set
a
jurisprudential
standard
for
investment
contracts
and
while
the
courts
work
on
the
habits
of
people,
people
work
on
the
habits
of
courts.
there
are
lines
that
have...
mr.
michael
k.
wolensky
that
is
correct.
you've
never
explicitly
said
that,
but
by
never
explicitly
saying
that,
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
necessarily
is
covered.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
followed
this
court's
precedents.
it
was
correct
and
it
should
be
affirmed.
