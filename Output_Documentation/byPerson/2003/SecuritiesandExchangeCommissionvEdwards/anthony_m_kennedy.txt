justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the...
depending
on
the
investment
skills
of
others,
that's...
is
very
unhelpful
to
me.
i...
i
would
think
most
creditors
who
extend
credit
rely
on
the
investment
skill
or
the
financial
responsibility
of...
of
the
lender.
that's
how
they're
going
to
get
their
money
back.
so,
i...
i
find
that
test
hard
to
work
with
as
a
limitation.
i
know
it
comes
from
howey.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
my
point
is
all
creditors
do
that
just
on
straight
loans...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
doesn't
advance
us
very
far.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
reves
case
had
language
that
doesn't
help
you
because
it
seems
to
exclude
a
fixed
return,
but...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i...
i
don't...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
know
how
great
the
reves
case
is
for
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
problem
is,
as...
as
you
well
know,
justice
ginsburg
begins
it,
and
the
chief
justice
is
asking
the
same
question,
if
we're
going
to
write
this
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
have
some
limiting
principles,
some
limiting
language.
now,
we
could
just
talk
about
these
facts
and
it'd
be
a
case
good
for
this
ride
only,
but
we're...
we're
wondering
about
whether
or
not
these
facts
yield
certain
insights
as
to
what
might
be
definitional
principles
for
an
investment
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but...
but...
but
you
don't...
well,
maybe
you
do...
we
just
say
an
investment
contract
can
include
a
fixed
return
and
then
remand
it
to
the
eleventh
circuit
for
it
to
figure
out
the
puzzle?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your...
your
opening
argument
says
there
are
agreements
for
investment
contracts...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
you
asked
us...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in...
in
forman
there
was
no
distinction
between
fixed
and
variable
income.
