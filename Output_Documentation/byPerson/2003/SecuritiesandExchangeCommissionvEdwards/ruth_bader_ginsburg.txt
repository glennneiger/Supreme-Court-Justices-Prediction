justice
ruth
bader

general
olson,
you...
you
put
the
stress
on
investment
and
that
seems
right
with
the
statute
refers
to
investment
contracts,
but
there
are
surely
debt
instruments
that
would
not
be
investment
contracts.
so
what
is
the
dividing
line
between
something
that
constitutes
a
plain
old
debt
that
is
not
an
investment
contract
and
not
a
security,
and
one
that
is?
i
mean,
how
do
we
identify
something
as
an
investment
contract
rather...
rather
than
an
ordinary
debt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
makes
it...
what
makes
something
an
investment
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
your
loan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolensky,
you
don't
challenge,
do
you,
that
under
state
blue
sky
laws,
this
distinction
between
variable
and
fixed
return
is
not
made,
that
state
blue
sky
laws
treat
as
investment
contracts...
do
not
draw
the
line
between
fixed
and
variable
returns?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
that
there
are
a
body
of
cases
under
state
blue
sky
laws
that
involve...
maybe
some
of
them
even
involve
these
payphone
schemes...
but
that
have
fixed
and
not
variable
returns?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why,
if
this
notion
of
an
investment
contracts
comes
out
of
state
blue
sky
laws
and
we
are
told
that
the
one
thing
in
this
area,
because
schemes
are
invented
every
day,
is
that...
that
the
interpretation
should
be
flexible,
not
static,
to
meet
the
countless
and
variable
schemes
devised
by
those
who
seek
the
use
of
money
of
others?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
the
issue
isn't
in
the
case,
what
a
court
says
in
a
casual
footnote,
when
the
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
fixed
versus
variable
returns.
i
mean,
yes,
the
court
made
it
used
in
cautious
languages,
but
we...
but
in
none
of
the
cases
that
came
here
was
the
question,
do
you
draw
the
line
between
fixed
and
variable
returns?
in
the
case
that...
that
you
featured...
you
call
it
forman
or
united
housing...
there
it
was
a
question
of
investment
versus
consumption.
did
you
buy
this
thing
to
sit
back
and
get
money
from
it
or
did
you
buy
it
so
you
could
live
in
the
house?
that
was
the
distinction
that
was
before
the
court
in
this
case.
i
don't
know
any
of
our
cases
that...
that
drew
the
line
between...
that
where
the
issue
was
before
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
did...
but
the
case
was
not
about
equity
versus
debt
classification.
it
was
about
whether
you
were
attracted...
whether
you
were
attracted
to
purchasing
the
shares
by
a
desire
to
get
a
financial
return
or
were
you
attracted
because
you
wanted
a
place
to
live.
that's
what...
that's
the
two
questions...
that
was
the
dividing
line
that
the
court
was
dealing
with
there.
it
wasn't
dealing
with
equity
versus
debt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that...
i
thought
that
the
meaning
of
investment
contract
was
not
at
issue
in
reves.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
there
is.
i
think
that
in
united
housing
itself
they
spoke
about
profit
may
be
derived
from
income
yielded
by
an
investment,
income
yielded
by
investment.
that
doesn't
say
income
from
earnings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
said
that
in
one
place.
they
said
financial
returns
in
another
place.
they
said
income
in
another
place.
maybe
they
were
so
incautious
about
the
precise
use
of
those
terms
because
they
were
focusing
on
an
investment
purpose
versus
a...
a
utilitarian
purpose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
isn't
there,
when
the
sec...
let's
assume
that
you're
right
about
that
the
sec
was
never
crystal
clear
about
its
position.
but
now
it
says,
we've
looked
at
these
schemes,
payphones
is
a
good
one,
a
lot
of
elderly
people
are
investing
in
these
schemes
because
they
promise
a
fixed
return
and
that
sounds
secure
to
them,
better
than
variable
out
of
earnings
and
profits,
so
this
is
exactly
what
we
should
be
protecting
the
public
against.
if
the
sec
takes
that
position
clearly
now
and
you're
dealing
with
a
statutory
term
that's
in
a
line,
some
of
the
things
are
equity,
some
are
debt,
and
in
the
middle
is
this
term
investment
contract.
why
should
we
tie
it
to
variable
versus
fixed?
