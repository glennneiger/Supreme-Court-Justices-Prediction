chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
united
housing
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
united
housing
case
did
refer...
suggest
that
the
requirement
that
the
income
come
from
profits,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if...
if
you...
if
you
don't
like
dicta
that's
against
you,
a
lot
of
the
things
you've
been
quoting
are
dicta
that
weren't
really
necessary
to
deciding
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
i...
i
loaned
someone
$10,000,
they've
just
hung
out
their
shingle
to
practice
law,
and
i'm...
i
want
obviously
the
money
back,
but
whether
i
get
the
money
back
or
not
is
very
much
going
to
depend
on
his
skill.
is
that
an
investment
contract?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
all
these
are
transactions
between
individuals.
that
doesn't
distinguish
anything.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is...
are
you
saying
then
that
a
one-on-one
transaction
can
never
be
an
investment
contract?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
it's
different
in
that
here
there's
a
fixed
return.
in
those,
there
was
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
meant
cases
in
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
were...
were
they
all
fixed
return
cases
then?
you
say
there
was
not
one
of
them
that
excluded
fixed
returns.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
management
expertise
is
required
to
manage
payphones?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
isn't
exactly
warren
buffett,
though,
running
around
replacing
payphones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
olson.
mr.
wolensky,

you.
chief
justice
william
h.

why,
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolensky.
general
olson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice

h.
rehnquist

general
olson.

case
