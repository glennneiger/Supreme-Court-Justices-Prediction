mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
over
10,000
persons
in
38
states
invested
$300
million
in
respondent's
payphone
business
on
the
expectation
that
their
investments
would
yield
a
14
percent
return
due
to
respondent's
experience,
efficiency,
and
management
expertise.
the
decision
below
that
these
transactions
were
not
investment
contracts
merely
because
they
specified
a
fixed
return
to
the
investor,
rather
than
an
unspecified
portion
of
the
enterprise's
profits,
can
not
be
squared
with
the
language,
history,
and
purpose
of
the
securities
acts,
70
years
of
consistent
sec
interpretation
and
enforcement,
and
this
court's
jurisprudence.
the
congressional
definition
of
security,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
is
broad
and
flexible,
and
intended
to
be
all-inclusive
to
cover
the
countless
and
variable
schemes
devised
by
those
who
would
seek
money
from
others
on
the
promise
of
a
return.
congress
intended,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
to
encompass
virtually
any
instrument
that
might
be
sold
as
an
investment,
and
the
term
investment
contract,
this
court
has
held,
was
intended
to
be
a
broad
catch-all.
therefore,
substance,
not
form
or
title,
governs.
these
terms,
investment
contract,
are
to
be
construed
broadly
to
embrace...
again,
in
the
words
of
this
court...
all
forms
of
investment
schemes
that
bear
a
resemblance
to
what
is
commonly
understood
to
be
a
security.
and
this
court
has
said,
because
promoters
are
so
creative,
these
terms
must
be
flexible
and
inclusive.
a
catch-all
must
catch
all.
it
is
irrational
to
conclude
that
congress
would
have
defined
security...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
justice
stevens,
i
can
answer
this
by
saying
that
the
seminal
case,
howey,
referred
to
and
cited
blue
sky
cases
and
federal
court
of
appeals
decisions,
which
did
contain
those
type
of
instruments,
fixed
return
instruments.
this
specific
question
has
not
previously
been
decided
by
this
court,
but
the
court
has
never
decided,
and
the
cases
that
the
court
referred
to
in
howey
did
not
ever
say
that...
that
the
fixed
return
instrument
was
excluded
from
the
term
investment
contract.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
again,
with
respect
to
that
case,
the...
i...
the
court
has
decided
consistently
that
what
is
critical
is
the...
that
the
investor
expects
a
return.
the
court
has
never
said...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the...
the
references
to
the...
to
the...
this...
from
this...
our
perspective,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
return
must
be
examined
from
the
standpoint
of
the
investor,
the
invest...
and
the
court...
i
don't
think
the
court
intended
to
restrict
in
that
case,
and
the
language
is
not
reasonably
susceptible
in
my
judgement
to
the...
to
the
understanding
that
that
was
intended
to
exclude
investments
or
instruments
that
provided
a
fixed
return.
what
the
court
has
repeatedly
referred
to
is
the...
from
the
standpoint
of
the
investor,
what
the
investor
is
expecting
to
do
is
to
put
his
or
her
money
to
work
for
him
or
her,
that
is
to
say,
put
that
money
into
an
enterprise
of
some
sort
so
the
investor
can
sit
back
and
watch
the
returns
come
in.
the
investor
doesn't
care
whether
that's
a
fixed
return
or
a
speculative
return.
in
fact,
the
definition
in
both
the
33
and
the
34
act
includes
types
of
investments,
such
as
common
stock,
that
have
speculative
returns
built
into
their
definition,
so
to
speak,
fixed
returns
instruments,
such
as
bonds,
preferred
stock,
indentures,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
then
the
term,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
those
terms
are
relatively
fixed
and
understood.
but
because
congress
wanted
to
embrace,
because
this
is
a
remedial
statute
intended
to
protect
the
investing
public
and
the
integrity
of
the
marketplace
so
that
people
will
feel
secure
in
investing
their
resources
in
other
instruments
that
promoters
are
offering...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
the
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
many
of
those
instruments
that
are
ordinary
debt
instruments
may
be
investment
contracts
as
well.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
that
these
terms
are
overlapping...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
when
a
person
puts
their
money
into
a
common
enterprise
with
the
expectation...
expectation
of
a
return,
that
is...
through
the...
as
a
result
of
the
efforts
of
others,
that
is
an
investment
contract.
now,
many
notes,
or
many
types
of
offerings,
might
be
based
upon
a
fixed
return
and
might
appear
in
the...
to
look
like
notes
or
fixed
return
types
of
investments
and
still
be
investment
contracts.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
it
does...
it
does
come
from
howey,
and
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
look
at
that,
justice
kennedy,
is
to
look
at
that
the
investor,
as
opposed
to
using
his
own
resources,
his
own
efforts,
his
own
energy,
his
own
creativity,
is
counting
on
other
people
to
make
the...
the
instrument...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well...
well...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that's
right.
that's
correct.
and
there
are
some
overlap,
but
this
court
has
said,
and
it
repeated
it
and
analyzed
it
from
that
context
in
the
reves
case,
that
there
are
some
commercial
contexts
and
some
consumer
contexts
in
which
the
securities
acts
were
never
intended
to
cover.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
we...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
what
the
reves
case
says,
and
i
think
your
honor
is
referring
to
footnote
4
in
the
case,
in
which
the
court,
in
construing
what
was
meant
by
the...
the
term
note,
looked
at
the
definition
of...
in...
in
the
forman
case,
which
included
the
earlier
howey
case,
as
to
define
an
investment
contract.
but
in
that
footnote,
the
court
very
carefully
went
on
to
say
the
definition
that
we're
examining
here
with
respect
to
investment
contract
is
irrelevant
with
respect
to
notes.
that
is
dicta
piled
upon
dicta
in
a
sense,
because
the
court...
we...
i...
we
respectfully
submit...
mischaracterized
forman,
the
case
that
the...
where
the
court
was
concentrating
on
the
difference
between
someone
investing
their
resources
to
get
something
to
use,
in
that
case...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
we...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
what
we're
quoting
with
respect
to
what
we're
relying
on
is
dicta.
what
the...
the
court
is...
has
defined
the
term
investment
contract,
first
of
all,
in
the
joiner
case,
and
then
in
the
howey
case
in
very
broad
terms.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
that's...
that
is...
that
is
probably
not
an
investment
contract
because
it
is
a
personal
transaction
between
individuals.
what
this...
could
the
factors
that
this
court
used
in
the
reves...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
the...
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
said
in
reves
is
that,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
any
ambiguities
at
the
edge
and
those
particular
factors
were
considered
in
reves,
it...
the...
the
scheme
of
distribution,
the
nature
of
the
relationships
between
the
individuals,
is
this...
the...
is
someone
seeking
to
acquire
money
to
use
as
capital
in
the...
in
the
operation
of
an
enterprise...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
no,
we're
not
saying
that.
in
fact,
the
court
held
to
the
contrary
in
the
wharf
holdings
case
that
there
may
be...
and
in
another
case
in
this
court's
jurisprudence...
that
simply
because
there
are
one
individual
or
one
entity
dealing
with
another
entity
doesn't
exclude
the...
the
operation
of
the
term
investment
contract.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
with
respect
to
the
cases
at
the
margin,
the
court
articulated
the
same
kind
of
analysis
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
does.
where
there
are
cases
at
the
margin,
the
court
will
consider
the
motivation
of
the
person
raising
the
money,
the
person
investing
in
the...
in
the
operation,
the
nature
and
type
of
promotion
that's
taking
place,
and...
and
the
motivations
of
the
seller
and
things
of
that
nature.
what...
what
the
question
presented
here
is
considerably
more
narrow,
the
question
presented
here
is
it...
is...
is
it
disqualified
as
an
investment
contract
simply
because
the
return
is
fixed
or
specified?
now,
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
that
definition,
imagine
the
size
of
the
super
highway
loophole
that
would
be
created
in
the
securities
act.
instead
of
promising
the
sky
or...
or
a
speculative
return,
the
investors
that
develop
these
types
of
schemes
will
simply
say
50
percent
or
25
percent...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
not...
the...
the
only
reason
that
the
eleventh
circuit
decided
that
this
case
couldn't
go
forward...
they
couched
it
in
terms
of
jurisdiction,
but
it's
really
failure
to
state
a
claim...
was
that
this
instrument
had
a
fixed
14
percent
return
and
said
investment
contracts
can't
not
include
that...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
precisely.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
would
adopt,
and
the
government
would
propose,
that
the
court
do
no
more
than
rearticulate
what
the
court
has
repeatedly
stated...
and
it's
stated
it
as
well
in
howey
as
it
could
possibly
state
it...
a
transaction
in
which
a
person
invests
money
in
an
enterprise
with
the
expectation
of
a
return,
gain,
profit.
now,
in
the
forman
case
that
we
submit
was
not
characterized
correctly
in
the
reves
footnote,
the
court
used
all
of
those
terms,
the
expectation
of
a
profit,
the
expectation
of
a
return.
in
howey
itself
the
court...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
the...
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
in...
in
those
kind
of
cases,
where
it
does
not
look
as
typical
as
the
typical
investment
scheme...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
what
makes
it
look
like
a...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
characteristics
are...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
things
that
make
it
look
like
an
investment
contract
in
this
context
is
that
the
individual
is
putting
himself,
his
money,
into
an
enterprise
that
is
being,
in
this
case,
widely
promoted...
as
i
said,
10...
over
10,000
investors
put
their
money
into
this
enterprise
hoping
to
get
some
return
as
a
result
of
the...
the
efficiency
or
effectiveness...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the...
the
precise
lines
here,
justice
o'connor,
may
be
difficult
in
a
particular
one-on-one
investment
case.
the
court
acknowledged
that
in
the
reves
case,
said
that
there...
there
are...
there
are
situations
that
look
more
like
consumer
transactions
or
they
may
look...
more
look
like...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
that's...
that's
correct,
justice...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
that
was
not
what...
yes,
that's
correct.
judge
lay
discussed
that
in
his
concurring
opinion,
but
the
court
did
not
rely
upon
that,
the
parties
have
not
briefed
that,
and
that
question
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
i
guess
that's...
i
guess
that's...
that's
possible.
i...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
we
did.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
we
do.
and...
and...
i
think
that
there
is...
this
is
not
a
difficult
case
from
that
standpoint,
because
all
of
the
indicia
that
the
sec
has
been
using
for
years,
and
what
the
sec
has
articulated
this
standard
in
formal
adjudications,
to
which
this
court
defers
under
chevron,
it
did
2
years
ago
in
the
zandford
case,
with
respect
to
the
sec,
there
is
here
in
this
case
70
years
of
consistent
enforcement
of
this
principle
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
precisely,
and
the
court
has
not
done
that
in
the
past,
does
not
need
to
do
so
here.
there
are
situations
like
the
reves
case
where
the
court
said,
well,
some
notes
are
securities,
some
notes
are
not
securities,
and
then
goes
through...
what
the
court
in
that
case
was
looking
at,
a
second
circuit
decision
that
said,
well,
some
notes
are
not
securities,
some
are
securities,
and
then
laid
out
a
methodology,
which,
by
the
way,
is
the
same
methodology
that
the
sec
understand...
well...
widely
understood
to
employ
with
respect
to
those
cases
at
the
margin.
but,
justice
breyer,
i
agree
completely.
this
is
a
paradigmatic
investment
contract.
it's
like
the
cases
involving
chinchillas
or
rabbits,
one
of
these
cases
involving
rabbits,
it...
there's
two
of
the...
two
of
the...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
that's
not
correct,
respectfully,
mr.
chief
justice.
two
of
the...
two
of
the
cases
cited
in
howey,
people
v.
white
and
stevens
v.
liberty
packing,
were...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
no.
i'm
talking
about
cases
that
this
court
accepted
when
it
decided
the
howey
case,
but
this
court
has
never...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
certainly
wasn't
ruling
it
out,
justice
scalia.
what
this
court...
what
the...
this
court
specifically
said
in
howey,
because
it
had
nothing
to
go
on.
congress,
first
of
all,
decided
to
make
the
definition
as
wide
as
possible
to
use
again
this
court's
language
to
cover
everything
that
might
commonly
be
understood
to
be
a
security,
and
because
promoters
are
so
ingenious,
to
cover
all
types
of
investments
that
might
carry
some
of
those
characteristics.
so
the
court
said,
we're
going
to
look
at
the
cases
that
involve
the
blue
sky
statutes
that...
that
had
been
in
existence
and
had
been
interpreted
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
33
act.
there's
not
one
of
those
statutes
that
limited
investment
contract
to
a
variable
return
and
excluded
fixed
return,
was
not
one
of
those
cases
under
the
blue
sky
statutes
that
excluded
fixed
return
investment
contracts
from
the
definition
of
investment
contract.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
they
were
not...
they
were
not...
some
of
them
were
variable
returns,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
some
of
them
were
fixed
return.
the
two
cases
i
cited,
the
one
was
people
v.
white,
where,
if
the
court
looks
at
that
case,
the
court
will
find
that
the...
the...
the
language
of
it
is...
the
party
of
the
first
part
will
pay
$5,000
and
the
party
of
the
second
part
after
5
years
will
pay
$7,500
back.
that
was
a
fixed
return
investment.
but
not
only
did
the
court
in
howey
cite
those
two
blue
sky
cases
that
involved
fixed
returns,
but
the
court
cited
then
four...
and
we
mention
these,
i'll
not
go
through
the
names
again
here,
we
mention
them
in
our
briefs...
four
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
had
involved
no
pooling
of
interest
and
there...
there
have
been
two
sec
formal
adjudications,
which
again,
as
i
said,
this
court
gives
deference
to.
and
the
first
time
the
sec
sought
to
enforce
an
investment
contract
in
this
kind
of
context
is
sec
v.
universal
services,
which
goes
back
to
1936.
very
seldom
does
this
court
have
that
kind
of
70-year
history
of
consistent
enforcement
by
the
agency
vested
with
responsibility,
and
again,
these
have
matured
themselves
into
not
only
court
decisions
but,
in
addition,
formal
adjudications.
the
securities
laws
have
prophylactic
purposes.
they
are
designed
to
protect
people
that
put
their
money
in
the
hands
of
other
people
who
are
running
business...
businesses...
and
from
whom
they
expect
to
make
a
return.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
exhibit
17
and
particularly
pages
116
through
119
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
this
is
the
type
of
note
that
the...
the
respondent
will
say,
well,
this
was
not
our
document,
this
was
one
of
our
distributor's
documents,
but
it's
alleged
in
the...
in
the
complaint
and
there
is
evidence
to
support
that
this
is...
this
was
out
there
available
for
investors
to
see.
there
are
millions
to
be
made
from
pay...
owning
payphones,
watch
the
profits
add
up.
and
then
on
page
119,
this
document
goes
on
to
say,
for
the
payphone
owner,
the
need
to
do
individual
things
to
make
money
is
taken
care
of
through
these
management
contracts,
because
the
payphone
owner
can
benefit
from
the
experience,
operating
efficiencies,
and
management
expertise
provided
by
ets
payphones.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there's...
there
are
many
of
things,
at
least,
a,
there
was
a
promise
that
it
was
done,
and
secondly,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
that
payphone
is
put,
how
it
is
managed,
the
appearance
of
the
payphone,
is
it...
is
it
mechanically
functioning
properly.
this
was
the
promise
that
was
held
out...
give
your
money
to
us,
we
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
these
payphones...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
maybe
that's
the
point,
that...
that
the
thousands
of
investors
who
invested
in
this
type
of
scheme
are
the
same
type
of
thousands
of
investors
that
invest
in
other
types
of
schemes.
what
the
securities
exchange
acts
require
is
that
for
people
who
are
marketing
opportunities
to
invest
widely
to
the
public...
and
i
use
the
word
widely
carefully
because
it
doesn't
have
to
be
that
widely,
but
it
was
here...
to
expect
people
to
provide
their
money
and
then
to
provide
a
return
to
put
their
money
to
work,
that's
what
the
securities
laws
are
all
about,
to
provide
that
remedial
prophylactic
purpose
of
requiring
registration
so
honest
transactions
will
take
place
in
the
marketplace.
if
the
investor
could
do
to...
to...
to
comply
with
the
eleventh
circuit
and
say,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
say
14
percent
anymore,
i'm
going
to
say
you're
going
to
double
your
money
every
5
years,
or
it's
going
to
be
a
good
return,
it's
going
to...
it's
going
to
be
pie
in
the
sky,
you're
going
to
go
home
and
retire,
that
would
all
of
a
sudden
make
it
not
an
investment
contract.
and
the
very
people...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
if
it's...
if...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
mr....
justice
scalia,
if
it's
the
same
kind
of
transaction
where
i...
i'm
going
to
buy
this
payphone,
lease
it
back
to
me,
i'm
going
to
have
a
management
contract,
and
you're
going
to
make
a
lot
of
money,
the
fact
that
it's
one
person,
this
court's
jurisprudence
says
does
not
make
it
not
that...
does
not
make
it
not
an
investment
contract.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
because
it
is
a...
it
is...
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
it
is
a...
it
is
a
package
in
which
it...
in
the...
in
the
first
place
is,
i
think,
justice
breyer's
question
suggests
it
might...
that
might
be
a
note
and
that
might
be
a
security
under
certain
circumstances.
but
is
it
a...
it
is
the
type
of
scheme
transaction
in
which
people
invest
their
money
on...
for
those
types
of
purposes,
and...
and
in...
where...
where
there
are
difficulties
at
the
margin,
this
court
and
the
sec
have
provided
a
formula
by
which
these
various
different
factors
can
be
examined
as
in
the
reves
case.
what
i
was
about
to
say
is
that
to
the
extent
that
you
change
the
requirement
and
allow
it
to
be
speculative,
the
more
speculative
you
can
be,
the
less
likely
you're
required
to
comply
with
the
securities
laws.
that
seems
like
tilting
the
securities
laws
completely
on
their
head.
the
people
that
are
the
least...
that
are
the
most
risk-averse
are
looking
for
guarantees
of
returns
and
fixed
returns.
the
people
that
depend...
that
aren't
the
warren
buffetts,
that
depend
upon
the
integrity
of
the
system,
are
the
ones
that
are
going
to
be
most
vulnerable
if
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
is
upheld.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gen
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
try
to
make
just
three
points.
one,
this
is
about
securities.
the
statute,
which
is
extraordinarily
broad,
says
note,
stock,
treasury
stock,
fractional
undivided
interest
in
oil,
gas,
mineral
rights,
straddle,
option.
it's...
there...
it
would
be
difficult
to
draft
the
statute
that
was
intended
to
be
more
all-inclusive
than
the
words
used
in
these
two
provisions
of
the
33
and
34
act.
it
is
manifestly
clear
that
congress
wanted
to
cover
the
waterfront,
as
this
court
has
said,
everything
that
looks
like
a
security,
and
wanted
to
cover
the
whole
range
from
pure
equity,
if
there
is
such
a
thing,
to
pure
debt,
if
there
is
such
a
thing.
it
would
be...
and
then
they
put
catch-all
provisions.
if
the...
if
the
words
didn't
cover
it,
there
were
catch-all
provisions,
investment
contract
is
one.
it
would
be
irrational
for
congress
to
say,
well,
we've
got
a
catch-all
for
those...
from
a
to
z...
that
go
from
a
to
h
that
look
more...
look
like
equities,
but
not
s
to
z
that
look
more
like
debt,
and
then
we're
don't...
not
sure
about
the
ones
in
the
middle.
the
purpose
for
the
catch-all
provision
is
to
catch
all.
that
is
what
this
investment
contract
was.
secondly,
just
two
of
the
cases
that
were
attempted
to
be
distinguished
by
my
colleague,
people
v.
white,
he
said
that
did
not
involve
a
fixed
return.
well,
the
language
of
the
case...
this
is
in
12
p.
2d
at
1081...
the
individual
promised
to
spay...
pay...
a
specified
sum
on
a
specified
date
as
principal
and
earnings
for
the
stated
period
of
time
upon
the
investment.
that's
pretty
much
identical
to
what
we
have
involved
in
this
case.
and
in
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
v.
universal
services,
another
one
that
my
colleague
referred
to,
page
234
of
106
f.
2d,
at
the
end
of
5
years
there
would
be
returned
to
each
member
an
amount
equal
to
total
contributions
plus
30
percent
per
annum.
now,
this
case
is
14
percent.
the
argument's
that
being
made
by
the
respondent
here
is
an
argument
that
the
blue
sky...
a
distinction
that
the
blue
sky
laws
don't
make.
congress
did
not
make
this
distinction.
the
court
has
never
made
this
distinction.
it
conflicts
with
70
years
of
consistent
sec
enforcement.
it
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
a
broad,
flexible,
remedial
purpose
of
the
securities
statutes.
it
would
make
no
sense,
would
create
a
gigantic
loophole
where
individuals,
by
changing
the
terms
of...
from
pie
in
the
sky
to
14
percent,
and
they
would
do
that
immediately,
and
congress
would
have
to
deal
with
it
in
a
way
the
congress
has
already
dealt
with,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
change
what
they...
what
the
law
has
been,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
should
be
reversed.
