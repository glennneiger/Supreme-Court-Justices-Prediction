justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
jump
ahead
for
a
second?
is
the...
is
your
adversary
correct
in
saying
that
as
far
as
decided
cases
are
concerned,
not
the
position
of
the
sec,
but
there
is
no
judicial
decision
holding
that
a...
an
instrument
that
provides
a
fixed
return
is
an
investment
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
isn't
the
question
about
the
individual
transaction
really
related
to
the
conflict
on
this
horizontal
and
vertical
distinction
that
judge
lay
relied
on
in
his
concurring
opinion?
and
as
i
understand
it,
that's
not
before
us
as
to
the
validity
of
his
vote
in
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
don't
understand
either
party
to
have
addressed
the...
this
alleged
conflict
over
horizontal
or
vertical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
entirely
possible
that
you
could
win
here
and
the
case
would
be
remanded
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
whether
or
not
judge
lay
was
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
no
debt
security
could
ever
be
an
investment
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
it
distinguished
between
a
fixed
return
and
an
other
kind
of
debt
security?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
contend
that
test
would
never
cover
a
debt
security?
that's
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
be
the
underlying
reason
for
excluding
debt
securities
and
limiting
the
coverage
of
the
act
to
equity
securities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
was
an
investment
risk
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
this
is
a
leasing
arrangement
that's
really
a
financing
arrangement.
the
use
of
leasing
for
financing
purposes
really
developed
after
the
act
was
passed...
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
really
a
financing
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
certainly
the
person's
return,
it
didn't
depend
on
what
happened
in
his
own
phone
booth,
the
one
he
happened
to
own.
his...
his
risk
was
what
the
overall
enterprise
would
produce,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sure
you
don't
think
a
person
who
buys
a
bond
doesn't
take
an
investment
risk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
buying
a...
a
whole
portfolio
of
bonds
is
not
an
investment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
those
60
years
we've
never
said
that
a
fixed
return
can
never
be
an
investment
contract.
