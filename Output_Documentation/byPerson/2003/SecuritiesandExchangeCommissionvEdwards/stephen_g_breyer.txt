justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
to
be
clear
about
your...
what
you're
saying
is,
there
are
a
lot
of
criteria
that
rule
out
loans,
ordinary
loans,
because
after
all,
they
would
otherwise
come
in
the
words
evidence
of
indebtedness.
there
are
a
lot
of
words
in
this
contract
that
could
pick
up
ordinary
loans,
but
then
there
are
a
lot
of
criteria
that
rule
them
out,
of
all
those
words,
not
just
investment
contract.
and
this
case
is
about
one
word.
what
you
would
like
is
a
decision
that
says,
the
word
profit
in
howey
meant
profit
in
the
sense
of
ordinary
return,
return
being
broad
enough
to
encompass
fixed
or
variable
returns
of
various
kinds,
period,
end
of
the
matter,
reversed
or
remanded.
that's...
that's
your...
that's
your
point,
not
get
into
these
other
criteria
for
other
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
preferred
stock?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
can
debt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
preferred
stock.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
can
debt
appreciate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
must
mean
something
special
by
investment
risk.
you
must
not
mean
what
we
ordinarily
mean
because
i
think
your
investors
don't
feel
that
way.
so
what
do
you
mean
by
it?
when
you
say
no
investment
risk,
you
know,
we're
all
reacting
this
way
because
it
seems
so
obvious
to
us,
anybody
who
invested
money
in
this
has
now
lost
all
his
money,
so
it
must
have
been
pretty
risky.
so...
so
i...
you
must
mean
something
special
by
it.
if
you
do,
i
want
you
to
explain
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
significant...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
hoped
you
would.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not...
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
other
criteria,
you
know.
i
mean,
you
have
to
be
putting
up
money,
it
has
to
be...
if
it
is
a
big
market...
scheme
marketed
to
the...
to
the
public
like
this,
yes.
but
if
it
isn't,
if
gm
happens
to
buy
some...
a
railroad
car
from
one
of
its
suppliers,
i
would
think
the
answer's
no.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
criteria,
so
why
everyone?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you'd
have
to
be
passive,
you'd
have
to...
you'd
have
to
treat
it
as
an
investment.
i
doubt
that
most
of
that
leasing
is
really
that,
but
i
mean,
my
point
is,
aren't
there
dozens
of
other
criteria
that
you
have
to
satisfy,
not
just
this
fixed
variable
one?
and
that's
a
serious
question.
i'm
interested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
invest
money
may
itself
refer
to
the
thousands
of
public
people
who
simply
want
to
give
money
to
an
enterprise
in
contrast
to
general
motors
that
rents
a
railroad
car
as
part
of
its
business.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the
example
of
the
bad
thing
that
happens
when
we
agree
with
the
sg?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
people
who
are
not
themselves
in
business,
by
people
who
are
not
themselves
in
business
or
by
people
who
are
themselves
in
business?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
come
to
this
quite
late,
but
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
other
words
besides
working
with
the
nature
of
the
fixed
or
variable
return
that
will
draw
the
kind
of
line
that
you
think...
and
i
guess
i
would
think...
you
should
draw
between
an
ordinary
business,
sale
and
lease-back
so
they
can
carry
on
their
business,
and
some
kind
of
general
marketing
to
the
public.
and
i'm
actually
quite
interested
in
that.
you've
written
about
it,
though,
and
i'll
get
it
out
of
the
briefs.
