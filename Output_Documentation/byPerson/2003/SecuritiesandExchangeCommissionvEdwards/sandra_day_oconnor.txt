justice

so
your
point
is
that's
all
we
have
to
decide,
whether
the
fact
that
it's
a
fixed
return
excludes
it
from
the
definition
of
a
security?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
some
clearer
understanding
of
what's
covered,
and
if
you
had
to
take
your
best
shot
at
constructing
a
definition,
what
would
it
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
at
least
where
it's
marketed
to
the
public
you
would
say
it's
covered,
at
least
that,
even
though
you
don't
know
backing
up
where
to
cut
it
off?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
as
a
public
policy
issue,
i
have
the
same
question
justice
souter
has.
from
a
standpoint
of
public
policy,
why
in
the
world
would
congress
want
to
exclude
a
broadly
marketed
scheme
like
this
from
the
definition
of
investment
contract?
why
would
it?
it's
marketed
like
other
schemes
that
might
have
a
variable
return.
they
put
all
these
little
phone
booths
together
and
it
required
the
management
of
others
to
know
how
to
place
them
and
service
them
and
make
it
work.
it's
not
something
that
the...
a
person
acquiring
the
lease
is
going
to
do
individually.
i
mean,
why
isn't...
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
exclude
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
it
does
from
the
standpoint
of
the
management
required
to
make
this
scheme
work.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
respondent,
charles
edwards,
was
the
chief
executive
officer
and
sole
shareholder
of
a
company
called
ets
payphones.
ets
sold
payphones
to
the
public
packaged
with
an
agreement
under
which
the
purchaser
would
lease
the
payphone
back
to
the
ets
for
a
fixed
monthly
payment.
these
payments
amounted
to
approximately
a
14%
annual
return
on
the
purchaserâ€™s
investment.
ets
was
unable
to
meet
its
obligations
under
the
leaseback
agreements
and
filed
for
bankruptcy.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
then
initiated
this
civil
enforcement
action
claiming
that
the
sale
and
leaseback
arrangements
were
subject
to
the
registration
requirements
and
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
law.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
arrangements
were
investment
contracts,
one
of
the
investment
instruments
included
in
the
definition
of
security
in
the
securities
act
in
1933
and
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
the
eleventh
circuit
disagreed.
it
read
our
prior
cases
to
require
that
an
investment
contract
offer
either
capital
appreciation
or
participation
in
earnings
and
thus,
to
exclude
schemes
such
as
this
one
that
offered
a
fixed
rate
of
return.
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
an
investment
scheme
promising
a
fixed
rate
of
return
can
be
an
investment
contract
and
thus
a
security
subject
to
the
federal
securities
law.
in
our
1946
decision
in
sec
versus
howey,
we
established
that
the
test
for
determining
whether
a
scheme
is
an
investment
contract
is
whether
the
scheme
involves
an
investment
of
money
in
a
common
enterprise
with
profits
to
come
solely
from
the
efforts
of
others.
when
we
spoke
of
profits,
we
were
referring
simply
to
the
income
or
return
that
investors
seek
on
their
investment.
thus,
there
is
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
promises
of
fixed
returns
and
promises
of
variable
returns
for
purposes
of
this
test.
moreover,
excluding
fix
return
schemes
from
the
securities
laws
would
open
up
and
easily
exploit
a
loophole
and
would
leave
unregulated
a
set
of
schemes
particularly
attractive
to
those
most
vulnerable
to
investment
fraud.
in
light
of
these
factors,
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
sec
has
consistently
rejected
the
limited
reading
of
investment
contract
that
respondent
advances,
and
we
do
the
same.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
