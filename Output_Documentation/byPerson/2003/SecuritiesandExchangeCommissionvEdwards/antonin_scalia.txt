we...
we've
gone...
gone
around
that.
i
mean,
the
problem
is
the
ordinary
loan,
the
ordinary
loan
from
one
individual
to
another.
i
loan
you
$10,000
and
you
will
pay
it
back
over
so
many
years
and
give
me
so
much
interest
a
year,
meets
that
qualification,
meets
that
description,
and
you
acknowledge
that
that
is
not
an
investment
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
makes
it
look
like
a
typical
investment...
i
mean,
that's
what
we're
trying
to
get...
justice
antonin
scalia
what
makes
it
look
like
the
typical
investment...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
is
not
the
mere
fact
that
it's
not
a
fixed
return.
that
isn't
it.
what
is
it
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
pretty,
you
know,
that's
a
pretty
tentative
attribution
to...
to
this
court,
that...
that
it
was
paying
that
close
attention
that
it
understood
in
all
of
those
cases
whether
it
was
a
fixed
return
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're...
you're
saying
that
it...
it
somehow
remains...
does
it
remain
or
not
remain
an
investment
contract
is...
if
all
that
you
alter
is
that
it
was
not
offered
to
the
public,
it's
one
individual
who
loans
money
to
this
company
and
the
business
of
this
company
is
with...
with
payphones,
okay,
and
the
deal
with
him
is
you
will
get
14
percent
a
year
back
on
your...
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
makes
it
different
just
from
a
straight
loan?
what
makes
it
different?
the
buying...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
buying
of
the
phone
first
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
bonds?
the
definition
also
includes
bonds.
the
term
security
means
any
note,
stock,
bond.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
but
when
some
of
the
things
that
are
specifically
listed
are
fixed
return
items,
it
seems
hard
to
credit
your
contention
that
somehow
the
reason
investment
contracts
cannot
cover
this
particular
arrangement
is
because
this
arrangement
has
a
fixed
return.
but...
but
congress
intended
the
term
security
to
cover
some
things
that
have
fixed
return.
why
not
investment
contracts?
justice
antonin
scalia
anybody
who
was
investing
in...
in
payphones
in
the
era
of
the...
the
satellite
was
taking
an
investment
risk,
i
would
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
the
buggy
went
just
before
the
horse...
just
before
the
automobile.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's...
it's
taken
that
position
for
a
long
time,
mr.
wolensky.
it's
not
just
the
case
law
that
you
have
to
contend
with,
it's
also...
this
is
after
all
an
administrative
law
case.
the
meaning
of
investment
contract,
you
must
admit,
is
at
least
ambiguous,
and
the
sec
has
taken
the
position
it's
taken
here
for
a
very
long
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
defer
to
the
f...
sec's
judgement
about
the
matter?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
