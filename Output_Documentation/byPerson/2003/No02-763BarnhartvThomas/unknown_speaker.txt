unknown
speaker
mr.
lamken,
this
case,
i
think,
involves
provisions
of
both
title
ii
and
title
xvi
of
the
act,
and
there
are
regulations
under
each.
unknown
speaker
now,
are
there
any
relevant
differences
in
the
text
of
the
two
statutes
or
the
regs
on
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
test.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
difference.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
i
have
a...
a
question
about
the
consistency
of
the
argument
you're
now
making
with
the...
with
the
commissioner's
regulation
concerning
you
don't
go
back
more
than
15
years.
that
seems
to
be
a
recognition
that
even
if
a
person
can
do
the
job
that
he
or
she
did
15
years
ago,
yet
there's
a
likelihood
that
maybe
that
kind
of
work
isn't
in
abundant
supply
anymore.
unknown
speaker
i'm
justice
ginsburg.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question
just
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
mr.
lamken?
when
this
applicant
suffered
her
physical
impairment...
i
forget
just
what
it
was
now...
she
was
able
to
go
out
and
find
a
job
as
a...
a...
an
elevator
operator.
right?
unknown
speaker
if
the
absence
of
elevator
jobs
had
occurred
earlier
and
she
hadn't
been
able
to
find
this
job,
she
would
clearly
be
disabled,
wouldn't
she?
unknown
speaker
she
would
have
made
the
fifth
step.
unknown
speaker
see,
the
thought
that
was
running
through
my
mind,
just
to
put
it
on
the
table,
is
that
in
a
sense
perhaps
the
government's
position
creates
a
disincentive
to
look
for
other
marginal
jobs
when
you're
in
this
position.
you
might
be
better
off
just
not
to
look.
unknown
speaker
capable
of
working
in
a
disappearing
species
of
jobs.
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
the
employer
said,
you
know,
you
can
operate
the
elevator
but
it's
just
going
to
be
going
for
6
months.
we're
rehabbing
the
building
and
after
that...
it's
just
a
6-month
job.
unknown
speaker
then...
then
is
she
again
barred
under
step
four?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
she
can...
she
can
perform
the
elevator
job
completely
well.
unknown
speaker
everybody
knows
it's
a...
it's
a
job
that's
soon
to
be
obsolete,
and
she's
told
that.
unknown
speaker
she'd
be
better
off
not
taking
that
job.
unknown
speaker
or
suppose...
or...
or
suppose
she
didn't
take
that
job.
would
she
then
still
be
barred?
unknown
speaker
yes.
very
well,
mr.--
--one...
one...
just
one
further
question.
in...
in
this
case
if
she
made
it
to
step
five,
it
wouldn't
be
just
a
question
that
the
burden
would
be
switched
to
the
government,
she
would
automatically
prevail.
isn't
that
the
case?
because
of
her
age?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
lamken.
mr.
alter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
your...
no.
it
has
to
exist
in
substantial
numbers
in
the
national
economy.
what
you're...
you're
arguing
that
a
job
that
does
exist
and
that
this
particular
supposedly
disabled
person
used
to
perform
and
which
is
offered
to
that
supposedly
disabled
person
but
which
that
person
turns
down
can,
nonetheless,
not
count
against
the
person's
disability.
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
me
it's
your
position
that...
that
presents
a
really
extraordinary
situation.
let's
say
i'm
a
juggler,
and
i
become
disabled.
and...
and
the
circus
i
was
a
juggler
at
comes
and
says,
you
know,
we...
we
want
you
back.
we
can't
find
another
juggler.
there
aren't
that
many
because
there
are
not
that
many
juggler
jobs
in
the
national
economy.
okay?
and
i
turn
them
down.
i
say,
i'm
tired
of
juggling.
and
you
say
that
i'm
handicapped
even
though
my...
my
prior
job
is...
is
right
there
waiting
for
me.
that
seems
to
me
an
extraordinary
result.
unknown
speaker
the
commissioner
has
explained
that
it's...
using
this
test,
can
you
perform
your
most
recent
job,
as
a
proxy
for
instead
of
testing
people
to
see
the
range
of
light
work
that
exists
in
the
economy.
they
say,
we're
just
using
this
as
a
shorthand
because
it's
administratively
convenient.
and
it's
not
using
it
to
say,
this
person
can
do
this
job
that's
obsolescing,
therefore
she
is
not
disabled.
this
particular
job
is
a
proxy
for
other
jobs
that
require
the
same
skill
level.
now,
what's
wrong
with
taking
that
position
instead
of
subjecting
people
to
a
whole
battery
of
tests?
unknown
speaker
in
substantial
numbers
in
the
national
economy.
unknown
speaker
the
very
job
may
exist
and
be
open
for
her
to
take.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
according
to
the
commissioner.
it's
according
to
the
statute.
can...
can
we
focus
on
the...
on
the
words
of
the
statute?
it
says
that
the
mental
impairments...
physical
or
mental
impairments
are
of
such
severity
that
he
is
not
only
unable
to
do...
not
only
unable
to
do
his
previous
work,
but
cannot,
considering
his
age,
education,
and
work
experience,
engage
in
any
other
kind
of
substantial,
gainful
work
which
exists
in
the
national
economy.
now,
you
want
to
take
that
last
phrase,
which
exists
in
the
national
economy,
and
attribute
it
to
the
earlier
phrase,
previous
work.
but
if
that's
what
congress
meant,
why
wouldn't
they
just
have
said
that
he
is
unable,
considering
his
age,
education,
and
work
experience,
to
engage
in
any
substantial,
gainful
work
which
exists
in
the
national
economy?
you...
you
want
to
effectively
read
the
first
phrase,
is
not
only
unable
to
do
his
previous
work,
right
out
of
the
statute.
they
may
just
as
well
have
dropped
it.
we
don't
read
statutes
to
contain
words
that
are
totally
superfluous,
and
you
have
made
them
totally
superfluous.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
see...
can
we
go
back
for
a
second
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
does
this...
i
mean,
your
reading
of
it
is
a
possible
reading,
i...
i
agree.
but
they're
saying
their
reading
makes
administrative
sense.
now,
this
is
my
understanding
of
it.
a
person
has
a
bad
back.
now,
there
are
bad
backs
and
bad
backs,
but
it's
not
a
good
thing
to
have.
so
she
has
a
bad
back,
and
we
want
to
know
how
bad
it
is.
and
they're
saying
if
it's
very
bad,
she
automatically
is
going
to
get
the
money
because
at
step
three
they'll
look
and
see
and
say,
look,
this
is
a
pretty
bad
back.
it
meets
our
criteria.
that's
the
end
of
it.
but
if
it's
medium
bad,
then
what
they're
going
to
say
is,
well,
first
question
is
can
she
still
do
her
last
job
as
an
elevator
operator.
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
that's
the
end
of
it.
and,
therefore,
if
the
answer,
however,
is
no,
then
we've
to
go
and
gear
up
our
vocational
experts.
are
there
dolls'
eyes'
sewers?
you
know,
they
have
a
few
odd
jobs
they
usually
bring
in
here--
unknown
speaker
--to
show
they
exist
in
the
national
economy.
and...
and
we
get...
we
don't
want
to
go
through
that
rigmarole.
so
for
a
medium
bad
back,
if
you
can
still
do
your
previous
work
as
an
elevator
operator,
you're
not
that
handicapped.
that's
the
end
of
it.
go
to
the
unemployment
office.
don't
go
to
the...
the
health
office.
now,
what...
that
to
me
makes
sense.
now,
what
to
you
doesn't
make
sense?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
well,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
exactly,
and
i
think
they
suggest
that
might
be
so.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
saying
it
is
to
that
end
because
it's
the
unemployment
office
that's
concerned
about
people
who
are
out
of
work
because
you
don't
have
elevator
operators
in
the
economy
anymore.
that...
it's
not
the
social
security
office,
they
say,
which
is
concerned
about
people
who
are
physically
hurt
or
mentally
hurt.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alter,
if...
if
we
think
the
statute
may
have
certain
ambiguities
in
it,
why
don't
we
owe
deference
to
the
secretary's
regulations
and
interpretation,
which
has
been
pretty
consistent
through
the
years?
unknown
speaker
if
we
think
there
is.
[laughter]
and
we're
not
crestfallen.
pick
up
your
crest
and
go
on,
mr.
alter.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alter,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
fact
that
a
number
of
circuits
and,
indeed,
three
judges
on
this
en
banc
court
thought
exactly
that,
that
this
was
an
ambiguous
regulation,
that
it
had
been
applied
consistently
by
the
secretary,
and
that
it
was
entirely
reasonable,
the...
the
notion
that
your
current
work
is
a
proxy
for
can
you
do
light
work,
that
that's
a...
not
a
necessary
or
inevitable
one,
but
a
reasonable
one?
unknown
speaker
no.
step
five
in
her
case
we've
established
is
an
automatic.
it's
not
that
she's
shown
that
she
can't
do
light
work.
the
commissioner
says,
look,
when
you
get
to
be
55
years
old,
we're
not
going
to
mess
with
that.
if
you
can't
do
your
prior
job,
that's
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
you
haven't
because
there's
another
piece
of
it.
for
the
future,
regulation
that
doesn't
apply
in
your
case,
the...
the
commissioner
has
clarified
that
what
we
mean
is
can
you
do
the
physical
aspects
of
this
job
and
we
don't
look
to
see
whether
it's
an
obsolescing
job,
a
brand
new
regulation
that
doesn't
apply
to
your
case.
on
your
argument,
i
take
it...
you're
going
now
back
to
the
statute...
that
new
regulation
is
an
impermissible
construction
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
thought
you
said
skinmore.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
now,
what
does
chevron
amount
to?
i
mean,
if...
if
you're...
it
struck
me
always
that
the...
the
first
step
is
is
the
statute
ambiguous,
and
second,
if
it
is,
is...
is
the
construction
reasonable.
it
is
by
definition
a
construction
of
the
statute
you're
talking
about
in
the
second
step.
unknown
speaker
but
mead
was...
but
mead
was
not
a
chevron
case.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
rather
thought
that's
what
chevron
was
all
about.
i'm
interested
that
you
don't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
i
certainly
don't
see
that
in
mead.
i...
i
mean,
i
understand
that
there
have
been
views
around
taken
from
the
dissent
i
think,
that
maybe
that's
what
it
says,
but
when
i
read
it
about
17
times
now--
[laughter]
--it
didn't
seem
to
say
that.
i
mean,
it
said
that...
that
certainly
if
they
have
formal
proceedings,
that
would
be
a
strong
ground
for
thinking
that
we
would
apply
chevron.
and
if
they
didn't,
it
doesn't
mean
we
won't.
did
you
get
all
the
double
negatives?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
reasonable.
if
the
agency
has
given
it
a
reasonable
construction.
and
from
former
questions
this
morning,
the
suggestion
is
that
the
regulatory
approach
is
kind
of
an
administrative
shortcut
for
finding
out
whether
this
employee
is
basically
able
to
do
certain
types
of
light
work.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
what
does...
what
does
disabled
have
to
do
with
doing
a
job?
i
mean,
disabled
is
a...
is
a
physical
condition,
and
they
say
if
you
can
do
the
job
you
used
to
do,
you're
not
disabled.
unknown
speaker
the
word
is
disabled,
not
unemployed.
unemployment
insurance
is
something
different.
it's
a
different
program.
this
program
is
not
meant
to
provide
for
unemployment.
it's
meant
to
provide
for
disability.
unknown
speaker
and
all
the...
all
the
secretary
is
saying
is
if
you
can
do
your
prior
job,
you're
not
disabled.
that
seems
quite
logical
to
me.
i--
unknown
speaker
--then
she
should...
we
should
have
ended
it
at
step
three,
but
the
commissioner
makes
a
distinction.
and
her
impairment,
because
it
wasn't
on
the
chart,
doesn't
make
it.
she
is
not
at
that
point
disabled.
you
have
to
go
on
to
the
next
step.
if
she
were
disabled,
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
and
we
wouldn't...
but
she
isn't
disabled
under
this
formulation
because
she's
not
within
the
conditions
that
that's
the
end
of
the
examination.
unknown
speaker
you're
the
one
that...
that
is
tying
disability
to
employment,
not...
not
justice
ginsburg
and
i.
and...
and
yet,
you
keep
saying
that...
that
unemployment
insurance
is
a
red
herring.
you're
the
one
that
keeps
bringing
it
in.
you...
you
say
we
can't
tell
whether
the
person
is
disabled
unless
the
person
can
get
a
job,
but
that's
not
the
statutory
requirement
for
disability.
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
saying,
to
take
your
example,
if
you're
a
former
iceman
and
you're
still
strong
enough
to
deliver
ice,
you're
probably
able
to
do
other
jobs.
what
is
unreasonable
about
that,
even
if
there's
no
ice
delivery
anymore?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
at
the
point
at
which
you
get
to
step
five,
you've
already
found
that
the
person
can't
deliver
ice
anymore.
so
there
has
already
been
a
finding
of
some
disability
to
some
degree
irrespective
of
the
capacity
to
go
to
a
nonexistent
job.
i
mean,
the...
the
proxy
determination
has
already
been
made
before
you
get
to
step
five.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
step
four
is
there
for.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
an...
first
of
all,
i
don't
know
why
it
doesn't
exist.
we
have
elevator
operators
in
this
building.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so...
so,
i
mean--
[laughter]
it
points
out
a
certain
unrealism.
a
person
who
works
in
an
elevator
is
a
pleasant
person,
and
they
sit
down
for
some
of
the
day
and
they're
up...
standing
up
for
some
of
the
day.
and
they
have
to
see
that
people
get
on
an
off
properly.
it
requires
a
degree
of
intelligence.
it
requires
a
degree
of
personality.
it
requires
a
certain
degree
of
skill.
and
so
there...
you
would
have
thought
there
would
have
been
a
lot
of
other
jobs
like
that
in
the
economy.
and,
i
mean,
even
if
there
aren't
too
many
elevator
operators,
there
are
some.
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
point
out
the
realism
that
they
say
exists
behind
their...
their
assumption
there.
and
it's
pretty
hard.
we're
talking
about...
it's
really
hard
to
find
an
example
that
fits
the
category
you
want
to
say
this
is
in.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alter,
can
we
go
back
to
one
thing
that
you
said
i
don't
think
was
quite
right?
you
said
all
we
want
is
an
opportunity
to
show.
that's
not
so.
if
you
get
to
step
five,
you
win,
and
the
government
has
conceded
that.
you
don't
have
to
show
anything.
so
you're
looking
for...
you
say
if...
step
four,
if
she
prevails
on
that,
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
you
will
not...
it's
not
incumbent
on
you
to
show
anything.
unknown
speaker
she
did
work
at
this
job
for...
well,
7
years,
did
she
not?
unknown
speaker
because
she...
at
one
point
in
your
brief,
you
said
that
she
had
been
an
elevator
operator.
at
page
42,
you
said
for
a
few
months.
that
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
alter.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lamken,
you
have
19
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
those
regulations
were
subject
to
notice
and
