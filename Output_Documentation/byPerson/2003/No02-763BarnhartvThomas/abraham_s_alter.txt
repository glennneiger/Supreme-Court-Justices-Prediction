mr.
abraham
s.
alter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
the
commissioner
argues
against
its
own
theme
of
providing
a
remedy
when
someone
is
disabled.
congress
did,
indeed,
intend
to
make
a
difference,
to
separate
step
four,
previous
work,
from
step
five,
or
other
work,
but
congress
told
us
what
that
separation
is.
at
the
fourth
step,
previous
work,
age
is
not
a
factor,
education
is
not
a
factor,
and
prior
work
experience
is
not
a
factor.
this
is
simply
because
if
a
person
wasn't
too
old
to
do
his
job
or
her
job
in
1995,
we
assume
they
weren't
too
old
to
do
it
in
1996.
if
a
person
had
the
requisite
education
and
skill
level
to
perform
the
past
job
in
1995,
then
they
have
the
same
skill
level
and
education
level
in
1996.
and
of
course,
prior
work
experience
is
irrelevant
at
step
four
because
we're
talking
about
the
actual
job
that
she
did.
what
congress
didn't
intend
was
to
pretend
that
a
job
that
doesn't
exist
can
still
be
used
to
deny
benefits.
work
has
to
be
substantial.
the
commissioner
concedes
that.
it
has
to
be
gainful.
and
it
has
to
exist.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
that
is
exactly
what
i'm
saying,
judge
scalia...
justice
scalia.
i'm
sorry.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
a
person
is
not
disabled
or
not
disabled
at
any
one
step
of
the
sequential
evaluation.
your
honor's
question
focuses
on
the
immediate
reason
for
the
disengagement
of
the
person
from
the
workforce.
that's
not
the
commissioner's
position.
that
hasn't
been
the
commissioner's
position.
a
person
is
not
disabled
or
not
disabled
because
of
ringling
brothers
calls
them
on
the
phone
and
says,
please,
come
back.
they
are
disabled
by
operation
of
the
sequential
evaluation.
and
the
commissioner
is
the
one
who
promulgated
the
sequential
evaluation.
and
the
sequential
evaluation
is
a
recipe
with
alternating
steps
regarding
medical
and
vocational
factors.
and--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--justice
ginsburg,
your
rendition
of
the
commissioner's
argument
is
exactly
correct.
if
i
were
permitted
to
ask
a
question,
i
would
ask
myself
a
proxy
for
what.
it
is
a...
the
job
doesn't
exist.
so,
therefore,
her
ability
to
do
the
job--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--national
economy.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
correct,
but
in
most
cases
it
wouldn't
be
open
for
her
to
take.
that's
the
extreme
position
where...
and
that's
our
position
that
happened
in
this
case.
and
that's
a
very
extreme
position.
and
it
would
be
an
unintended
consequence
of
the
statute.
but
your
honor
is
absolutely
correct
that
that
is
their
position,
that
past
work,
even
if
it
doesn't
exist
in
substantial
numbers,
is
a
proxy
for
her
ability
to
do
other
work.
what
other
work?
at
the
fifth
step,
she's
disabled
because
she
would
not
be
able
to
make
an
adjustment
to
other
work
which
exists
in
substantial
numbers
in
the
national
economy,
according
to
the
commissioner's
statistics.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
on
the
contrary,
your
honor.
the
words,
any
other
kind,
would
be
superfluous.
congress,
indeed,
intended
to
make
a
difference
between
previous
work
and
any
other
kind
of
work,
and
that
difference
is,
besides
age,
education,
and
prior
work
experience,
which
are
irrelevant
at
step
five...
they
wanted
to
have
the
burden
on
the
claimant
for
disability
to
show
at
the
first
four
steps
that
she
is
disabled.
at
the
fifth
step,
it
is
the
commissioner
who
must
show
that
she
isn't
disabled.
and
that's
why
the
words,
which
exist
in
the
national
economy,
are
in
there
to
begin
with
because
what
they
wanted
to
preclude
was
the
commissioner
saying,
well,
you
can't
do
your
prior
job,
but
you
can
be
a
juggler.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
i
know.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
oh,
it
doesn't
make
sense
at
all
your
honor,
to
me,
obviously.
[laughter]
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
your
honor's
question
seems
to
make
step
four,
previous
work,
a
gauge
as
to
how
severe
the
severe
impairment
is.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
and...
but
step
four,
previous
work,
is
a
remedy
that
the
commissioner
can
use
for
their
convenience.
why
look
at
every
job
in
the
national
economy?
let's
start
here
and
see
if
that
medium
bad
back
would
preclude
her
from
her
past
job.
but
to
what
end?
so
that
she
can
resume
that
job.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
once--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--number
one,
your
honor,
pauline
thomas
could
never
collect
unemployment
insurance
because
the
first
thing
they
would
ask
her,
are
you
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
work?
do
you
have
any
medical
problems?
once
she
has
a
severe
impairment,
at
step
two
the
unemployment
argument,
issue,
or...
or
controversy
is
over.
once
she
shows...
because
that's
the
threshold.
when
the...
when
the
statute
says,
by
reason
of
a
medically
determinable
impairment,
it
doesn't
mean
exclusively
for
medical
reasons.
but
once
she
shows
that
medical
impairment,
to
who?
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
commissioner.
once
the
commissioner
says,
yes,
you
have
a
severe
impairment,
then
vocational
issues,
such
as,
okay,
you
can
do
a
job,
but
does
the
job
exist,
become
paramount
because
the...
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
provide
a
remedy.
now,
there
are
two
remedies
that
are
possible
after
this
sequential
evaluation
process.
remedy
one,
there
are
no
jobs
existing
in
significant
numbers
in
the
national
economy
that
you
can
do.
so
here's
your
benefits.
remedy
two,
you
know
what?
there
are
jobs
existing,
whether
it's
your
job,
whether
it's
another
job.
and
therefore,
we've
done
you
a
favor.
we've
told
you
that
the
economy
can
accommodate
you
after
your
injury.
therefore,
go
get
that
job.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
there
are
three
answers
to
that
question,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i'm...
i'm
crestfallen
that...
that
the
court
would
find
that
there's
ambiguity.
but
given
that...
that
they
would--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--if
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
the
commissioner's
construction
must
still
be
reasonable.
here,
i
would
say
it
is
not
reasonable.
that's
the
first.
because
it...
it
begs
reality.
the
reality
is
this
job
doesn't
exist
in
substantial
numbers.
or
at
least,
we
want
to
be
able
to
show
that
at
an
administrative
hearing.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
justice
ginsburg,
first,
let
me
take
the...
the
last
part
of
your
sentence.
proxy
to
do
light
work.
she
wins
at
light
work
at
step
five.
so
again,
it's
a
proxy
to
do
light
work.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
but
it's
the
reason
why,
your
honor,
because
she
can't
make
an
adjustment
to
any
jobs.
if
a
person
can
do
light
work,
that
proxy
issue,
she
can
do
her
past
job
which
is
light,
then
she
can
do
other
light
jobs.
but
the
commissioner
tells
us
that
she
won't
be
able
to
adjust
to
other
light
jobs.
and
will
she
be
able
to
adjust
to
her
current
job?
there
is
no
adjustment
to
a
current
job,
unless
the
job
doesn't
exist.
but
to
answer
your
question
about
the
other
circuits,
the
other
circuits...
circuits
focused
on
the
regulation,
focused
on
the
ruling,
82-61.
that
says,
well,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
whether
the
job
exists.
it's
whether
you
can
do
that
job.
and
most
of
the
other
circuits
said,
well,
the
regulation
says
do
your
past
job...
a
strict
reading
of
do
your
past
job
means
the
capacity
rather
than
a
reality
standard.
but
they
didn't
focus
on
the
statute.
and
if
i
might
answer
judge...
justice
o'connor's
question
about
ambiguity,
if
i
haven't
answered
your
question.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
may
i,
justice
o'connor,
answer
your
question?
the
deference
owed
to
their...
the
commissioner's
construction
of
the
statute
is
not
much.
it's
skidmore
deference.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
skidmore
deference,
skidmore
v.
swift.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
chevron,
the...
the
great
case,
the
elephant
in
this
room...
chevron
has
a
two-step
policy.
the
first
one
has
been
precluded
by
your
honor's
question,
whether
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
the
second
part
says,
well,
it
owes
great
deference
to
the
commissioner's
position,
but
not,
your
honor,
in
a
construction
of
a
statute.
it
is
this
court's
role
to
tell
us
what
the
law
is
and
what
the
law
means.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
under
u.s.
v.
mead
the
court
did
make
a
distinction
between
a...
an
administrative
policy--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--mead
was
a
construction
by
an
agency
case,
and
mead
says,
i
think...
my...
my
reading
is
that
if
a...
an
administrative
policy
is
at
issue,
great
deference
has
to
be
given.
but
a
construction
of
a
statute...
an
agency
does
not
have
deference,
great
deference,
because
of
administrative--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--well,
my
reading,
your
honor,
is
that
chevron
deference
will
only
apply
to
an
agency's
statutory
interpretation
if
it
emerged
from
a
formal
adjudication.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
i
understand.
all
i
can
do
is
assert
that
if
chevron
means
that
if
we
find
some
sort
of
ambiguity
in
a
federal
statute,
we
give
pretty
much
carte
blanche
to
the
agency.
that
was
my
reading
of
chevron.
that
would
be
a
disappointing
reading
of
chevron
because
i
think--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--i
would
argue,
your
honor,
that
it
is
not
reasonable
in
any...
by
any
stretch
of
the
word
because
may
i
remind,
your
honor,
that
we're
talking
about
a
job
which
may
not
exist
at
all,
and
a
finding
that
a
person
is
not
disabled
because
they're
capable
of
doing
a
job
that
doesn't
exist
can't
be
reasonable.
if
we
take...
i...
i
say
that--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--your
honor--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--but
what
i
meant--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--let
me
try
to
highlight
the
illogical
parts
of
that
then,
your
honor.
unemployment
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
litigation.
the
person
has
a
severe
impairment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
let's
be
precise.
the
person
has
cardiac
arrhythmias.
the
person
had
a
heart
attack
and
returned
to
work.
the
person
had
a...
a
herniated
disc
and
cervical
radiculopathy.
according
to
the
commissioner's
construction
here,
the
only
job
in
the
world
that
she
could
adjust
to
is
a
job
which
may
not
exist.
once
she
has
a
severe
impairment,
your
honor
can
bring
up
unemployment
for
the
rest
of
the
session,
but
unemployment
is
a
red
herring
in
this
case
because
once
you
have
a
severe
impairment,
we're
not
talking
about
unemployment
anymore.
we're
talking
about--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--justice
ginsburg,
your
question
and
justice
scalia's
question
seem
to
me
to
define
disability
in
a
vacuum.
she
is
disabled...
she
isn't
disabled
because
she
can
do
a
job.
suppose
she
can
be...
she
be...
she
can
deliver
ice.
that
job
doesn't
exist
anymore
either.
suppose
she
could
be
a
court
jester.
disability
has--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--your
honor,
i
am
not
saying
that
a
person
is
disabled
unless
they
can
go
get
a
job.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
disability
means
that
a
medical
impairment
prevents
you
from
adjusting
to
work
which
exists
in
the
national
economy.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
because
at
step
five,
when
the
commissioner
says
that
you
cannot
adjust
to
other
jobs,
i
take
them
at
their
word.
statistically,
according
to
the
commissioner's
sequential
evaluation,
according
to
the
commissioner's
vocational
rules,
there
will
not
be
an
ability
to
adjust
to
any
other
job
which
exists
in
the
national
economy.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
keep
getting
back
to
that
proxy,
that
word
proxy.
well,
even
if
your
job
doesn't
exist,
it's
a
proxy
for
your
ability
to
do
other
jobs.
but
what
other
jobs?
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
yes,
your
honor.
i
gave
her
my
card.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
your
honor's
question
about
the
elevator
operator
is
a...
a
serious
one
because
an
elevator
operator
we
have
in
this
court
pushes
buttons.
yes,
there's
personality
involved,
but
i...
i
don't
think
that
one
of
these
individuals
would
be
denied
this
job
if
she
didn't
have
a
sterling
or...
or
a
wonderful
personality.
she
pushes
buttons.
that's
not
what
my
client
did.
my
client
operated
an
elevator.
the
reason
we
have
elevator
operators
in
this
building,
i'm
assuming,
is
to
add
to
the
majesty
of
the
building,
for
security
purposes
so
i
don't
wander
up
and
down
the
halls
where
i'm
not
supposed
to
go.
there
are
elevator
operators
in
luxury
buildings
which
really
act
as
security
or
helping
people
with
parcels.
this
person
pushes
a
button,
and
she's
here
for
a
reason,
which
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
my
client
was
doing.
she
was
opening
a
gate
and
opening
a
door,
et
cetera,
and
pushing
the
actual
buttons,
and
operating...
well,
you've...
everyone
has
seen
an
elevator
operator
from
the
old
days.
the
point
is...
the
point
is
that
all
we
want
to
do
is
show...
an
opportunity
to
show
what
every
ssi
claimant
can
show.
i
believe
it
was
justice
o'connor
who...
who
asked
is
there
a
difference
between
the
regulations
in
title
ii
and
title
xvi,
and
my
colleagues
said
correctly,
no,
there
aren't.
how
about
this?
how
about
pauline
thomas
never
worked
a
day
in
her
life?
she
was
on
welfare
her
whole
life.
she
doesn't
have
a
step
four.
we
treat
people
under
this
construction
who
have
worked,
as
pauline
thomas
does...
and
i
promised
her
i
would
say
this,
so
i'm
going
to
say
it...
for
27-and-a-half
years,
110
quarters
of
coverage.
and
she
paid
in
all
that
time,
sweeping
and
cleaning,
and
mopping
bathrooms
in
a
nursing
home,
and
had
a
heart
attack
and
went
back
to
work.
we
don't
treat
her,
under
this
construction,
as
well
as
we
treat
a
person
who
never
worked
a
day
in
her
life
because
then
she
automatically
goes
to
step
five
where
she's
disabled.
that's
the
first
thing.
the
second
thing...
i
don't
know
if
the
court
has
an
actual
transcript,
but
how
do
we
treat
this
person
differently?
pauline
thomas
will
get...
this
controversy
is
about
$672
a
month
in
disability
benefits
after
27-and-a-half
years.
if
she
had
not
worked
a
day
in
her
life--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--in
this
particular
case,
if
we
get
to
step
five,
we
will
win.
but
what
we
want
to
show
is
not...
obviously,
ms.
thomas
wants
the
benefits
and
i
want
to
win
the
case.
but
what
we
would
be
showing
is
that
past
work
is
not
a
proxy
for
another
kind
of
work
if
the
past
work
doesn't
exist
because
we
want
to
be
able
to
show...
it's
what
we
already
know...
that
the
commissioner
says
that
there
is
no
ability
to
adjust
to
another
job.
here,
if
her
job
doesn't
exist,
she
will
have
to
adjust
to
another
job
whether
we
call
it
her
past
job
or
not.
what
i
want
to--
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
--correct.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
a
few
years,
your
honor.
i'm...
my
mistake.
as
i
was
saying,
if
she
went
and
applied
for
ssi
in
new
jersey,
she
would
get
$583.25
as
we
sit
here
right
now.
so
the
difference
between
the
27
years
of
work
and
no
work
is,
number
one,
she
has
a
better
chance,
because
she
doesn't
have
to
go
through
step
four;
and
number
two,
she
gets
another
$80.
that
construction
leads
to
a
disengagement
between
the
worker
who's
paying
the
freight
so
that
the
commissioner
can
have
their
convenience
and
their
construction
and
the
actual
program.
the
program
must
reflect
reality.
disability
is
a
word,
but
it's
a
concept
that
comes
after
the
commissioner
has
put
in
place
a
sequential
evaluation.
and
that
sequential
evaluation
is
based
on
the
realities
of
the
workplace.
it
has
always
been.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
may
i
point
one
thing
out...
two
things
actually.
number
one,
the
commissioner
doesn't
call
it
past
work.
the
statute
calls
it
previous
work.
the
commissioner
calls
it
past
relevant
work.
what
is
more
irrelevant
than
a
job
that
doesn't
exist?
number
one.
number
two,
the
commissioner
says
that
there
are
no
vocational
considerations
at
step
four.
we
don't
care
about
whether
the
job
exists
or
not.
but
that's
not
the
case
because
the
commissioner's
own
ruling
states
for
a
fact
that
if
you
can't
do
your
past
job
as
you
performed
it,
we
can
still
deny
you
benefits
at
step
four
by
saying
that
we...
you
can
do
your
past
job
as
it's
performed
in
the
national
economy.
that's
a
vocational
consideration.
i
never
performed
that
job
that
way.
my
job
is
much
harder.
yes,
but
when
we
look
into
the
dictionary
of
occupational
titles,
we
find
your
job
and
many
jobs
are
done
in
a
lighter
version.
you
can
do
that
job.
but
i
never
did
it
before.
vocational
considerations.
ssi
claimants
have
more
rights
and
make
the
same
money
as
disability
claimants.
there's
something
wrong
with
that
in
terms
of
public
policy.
mr.
abraham
s.
alter
thank
you.
