mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
commissioner
of
social
security
has
long
construed
the
disability
insurance
program,
there
can
be
no
finding
of
disability
unless
at
least
two
conditions
are
met.
first,
the
claimant's
impairment
must
be
of
such
severity
that
she
cannot...
she
is
unable
to
do
her
previous
work.
second,
the
impairments
must
be
of
such
severity
that
the
claimant
cannot,
considering
her
age,
education,
and
experience,
engage
in
any
other
kind
of
substantial,
gainful
work
which
exists
in
the
national
economy.
construing
and
applying
those
provisions
for
more
than
3
decades,
the
commissioner
has
consistently
concluded
that
if
a
claimant
continues
to
function
at
a
level
sufficient
to
meet
the
demands
of
past
work,
then
the
claimant
is
not
disabled
without
the
necessity
of
inquiring
into
whether
that
particular
past
job
exists
in
significant
numbers.
that's
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
statutory
text.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is
correct.
it
is--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
your
honor.
we
don't
believe
that
there
are
any
relevant
differences,
that
the
commissioner's
regulations
and
the
statutes
themselves
are
all
phrased
in
parallel
if
not
identical
language
throughout.
there
is
one
difference
in
that
for
a
disability
insurance,
these
title
ii
provisions,
you
have
to
be
someone
who
has
paid
into
the
program
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
benefits
on
the
way
out;
whereas,
title
xvi
is
more
of
a
welfare
program
where
whether
you've
paid
in
in
the
past
doesn't
matter.
but
that
simply
means
that
one
who
has
paid
into
the
title
ii
program
would
get
considerably
more
benefits
than
one
who
has
not.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
on
the
test,
it
is
an
identical
test.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
there
is
no
test,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
construction
preserves
the
distinction
long
recognized
in
the
commissioner's
regulations,
in
fact,
recognizing
the
commissioner's
regulations
from
the
earliest
days
of
administering
this
statute.
between
disability
insurance,
on
the
one
hand,
and
insurance
against
other
causes
of
unemployment,
such
as
technological
and
economic
change,
on
the
other,
an
individual
who's
doing
a
job
who
remains
fully
capable
of
doing
that
job,
but
then
loses
the
job
because
of
economic
change
or
perhaps
the
job
never
existed
in
significant
numbers
and
the
individual
chooses
to
leave,
is
not
unable
to
engage
in
that
activity
by
reason
of
an
impairment,
which
is
the
test
under
the
statute
for
being
entitled
to
benefits.
and
it
made
sense
for
congress
to
draw
that
line
because
if
someone
continues
to
function
at
a
level
sufficient
to
meet
the
demands
of
their
previous
work,
it's
virtually
certain
that
they're
capable
of
doing
some
work
whether
or
not
that
particular
past
job
exists
in
significant
numbers
in
the
national
economy.
the
point
isn't
that
the
person
is
expected
to
return
to
that
particular
past
job.
rather,
it
is
their
continued
functioning
at
a
level
sufficient
to
meet
the
demands
of
that
job
provides
a
highly
accurate
and
administrable
test
of
the
fact
that
they
continue
to
function
at
a
level
sufficient
to
meet
the
demands
of
work
generally.
in
a
program
that
must
resolve
more
than
2
million
claims
a
year,
the
need
for
that
type
of
a
highly
administrable
test,
that
type
of
highly
accurate
test
is
particularly
acute.
and
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
test
one
would
have
expected
congress
to
provide.
a
potentially
large
number
of
americans
today
do
not
work
in
jobs
that
exist
in
significant
numbers
in
the
national
economy.
when
those
workers
leave
their
jobs,
whether
they
quit,
are
fired
for
misconduct,
or
leave
for
other
reasons
which
are
good
and
sufficient,
the
court
of
appeals
would
preclude
the
commissioner
from
denying
them
benefits
based
on
their
continued
capacity
to
do
that
past
job
even
if
that
job
is
still
available
to
them,
even
if
the
employer
is
on
the
phone
begging
them
to
return
to
their
job.
the
commissioner
reasonably
construed
the
statute
as
not
compelling
that
result.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
o'connor,
the
concern
of
that
15-year--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--oh,
justice
ginsburg.
the
concern
of
that
regulation
isn't
whether
or
not
that
particular
past
job
exists
in
significant
numbers.
it
provides
an
administrable
and
in
fact
prophylactic
test
to
make
sure
that
the
demands
of
that
job
are
demands
that
are
ones
that
are
likely
to
be
relevant
in
the
national
economy.
it's
unlikely
that
a
set
of
demands
of
a
job
would
completely
disappear
from
the
economy
entirely
during
any
one
person's
lifetime.
but
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure,
to
make
absolutely
certain,
the
commissioner
has
set
forth
an
administrable
bright
line,
15-year
rule
that
says
if
the
job
is
more
than...
if
you
did
the
job
more
than
15
years
ago,
we
won't
consider
it
out
of
that
concern.
but
it
is
not
a
consideration
of
whether
the
particular
past
job
exists.
it's
a
consideration
to
make
sure
that
your
continued
ability
to
the
demands
of
that
job
is
an
appropriate
and
accurate
measure
of
your
ability...
your
level
of
functioning,
and
that
your
level
of
functioning
is
consistent
with
work
generally.
if
there
are
no
further--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
correct.
from...
if
i
remember
correctly,
from
1988
to
1995,
she
worked
as
an
elevator
operator.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
justice
stevens,
i'm
not
sure
that
she
would
be
found
disabled.
the
commissioner
would
have
gone
through
the
steps
and...
and
determined
whether
or
not
she
had
a
severe--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--if
you
were
not
to
consider
the...
the
previous
work
of
an
elevator
operator
and
you
only
applied
the
fifth
step,
which
is
the
other
work
step,
in
isolation,
that's
correct,
that
she
would
have
been
found
not
able
to
do
other
work
in
the
national
economy.
but
the
fifth
step
is
designed
to
work
in
conjunction
with
all
the
other
previous
steps
and,
standing
alone,
does
not
necessarily
represent
an
accurate
determination.
congress
provided
two
conditions
that
must
be
met,
previous
work
and
other
work,
precisely
because
the
somewhat
abstract
inquiry
into
other
work
that
plaintiff
has...
the
claimant
has
never
done
may
not
be
a
fully
accurate
or
necessarily
an
easily
administered
mechanism
for
determining
the
level
of
work
that
the
claimant
can
do.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
stevens,
the
commissioner's
rules
actually
take
into
account
incentives
to
look
for
work
through
the
unsuccessful
work
attempt
regulations.
and
so
that
is
something
that
has
been
dealt
with.
and
the
same...
the
same
problem
existed
in
the
walton
case,
for
example.
it
is
unfortunate
that
sometimes
people,
by
engaging
in
socially
desirable
conduct,
going
out
and
working,
will
actually
provide
the
evidence
that
shows
that
they're
capable
of
working,
but
that
is
just
a
necessary
consequence
of
a
program
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
justice
stevens,
the
key
point
about
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
not
limited
to
cases
of
job
obsolescence.
it's
any
time
somebody
is
working
in
a
job
that
may
never
have
existed
in
substantial
numbers.
if
they
leave
that
job
for
whatever
reason,
if
they
quit
or
are
fired
for
misconduct,
under
the
court
of
appeals
rule,
the
commissioner
cannot
deny
them
benefits
based
on
their
demonstrated
ability
to
do
that
job.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
kennedy,
that
would...
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
that
sort
of
a
temporary
position
would
qualify
as
substantial,
gainful
work
under
the
commissioner's
regulations.
if
it
is
a
make-work
position
or
it's
a
position
that
does
not
represent
functioning
at
a
level...
it's
a
sheltered
position
or
it
is
some
other...
some
other
reason
that
it
is
not
evidence
of
functioning--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--if
this
is
something--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--justice
kennedy,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
terms
of
getting--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--if
the...
if
she
did
take
the
job,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
job
represented
functioning
at
a
level
that's
consistent
with
work
generally
that
is
substantial,
gainful
work,
she
would
be
barred.
and
she
perhaps
might
be
better
off
not
taking
the...
taking
a
job
like
that
under
the
commissioner's
regulations.
however,
the
mere
fact
that
somebody
taking
a
job
provides
evidence
that
they
function
at
a
level
that
is
consistent
with
past
work
doesn't
mean
that
we
should
come
up
with
less
accurate
determinations
by
ignoring
their
demonstrated
capacity
to
engage
in
their...
in
their
past
work.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the...
the
way
the
commissioner's
grids
are
set
up,
they
make
various
assumptions
regarding
the
effects
of
age,
the
exertion
levels
demanded
by
particular
jobs,
and
other
matters.
and
because
it
is
a
somewhat
hypothetical
inquiry
to
look
into
the
many
jobs
somebody
hasn't
done
in
the
past,
the
step
five
inquiry
sometimes
will
render...
will
deem
somebody
not...
will
deem
somebody
disabled
even
though
they
actually
can
work.
it
is
precisely
because
of
that
reason
that
congress
provided
two
measures
of
capacity
to
work:
a
highly
empirical
one,
can
the
person
do
the
jobs
they
actually
have
previously
done
in
the
past;
and
second,
whether
or
not
the
person
can
engage
in
the
other
jobs
that
they
haven't
actually
done
in
the
past.
and
because
the
two
steps
work
more
accurately
together,
that's
why
we...
one
of
the
reasons
we
believe
that
congress
provided
those
two
steps.
in
addition,
it
also
preserves
the
line
between
people
who
become
unemployed
because
of
their
impairment,
and
ones
who
happen
to
be
fully
capable
of
doing
their
past
jobs
but
lose
those
jobs
for
whatever
reason,
such
as
either
technological
obsolescence
or
they
simply
choose
to
leave
those
jobs
voluntarily.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you.
first,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
step
four
in
fact
is
a
measure
of
severity.
the
question
is
how
severe
does
the
impairment
have
to
be,
and
the
statute
tells
you
exactly
how
far...
how
severe
it
has
to
be.
it
has
to
be
so
severe
that
the
claimant
is
unable
to
do
his
previous
work.
so
the
step
four
inquiry
of
previous
work
is
a
measure
of
severity,
and
the
commissioner
has
consistently
used
that
measure
of
severity
to
determine
whether
the
individual
is
functioning
at
a
level
that
is
consistent
with
work
generally.
in
fact,
in
terms
of
the
deference
to
which
the
commissioner's
construction
is
entitled,
this
has
been
the
commissioner's
current
construction
from
the
outset
of
the
program,
both
from
before
this...
the
particular
provisions
we've
been
discussing
were
adopted
in
1967
and
after.
we
believe
that
they're
clearly
reflected
in
the
commissioner's
regulations
from
1978,
and
any...
any
ambiguity
in
those
regulations
was
cleared
up
in
1982
with
respect...
by
the
issuance
of
ssr
82-40.
the
commissioner's
current
regulations,
which
became
effective
september
25th,
now
make
it
abundantly
clear
and
explain
in
absolutely
certain
terms
that
the
commissioner
does
not
consider
whether
or
not
the
previous
work
exists
in
significant
numbers
in
the
national
economy.
because
that
is
the
result
of
a
rulemaking,
because
it
is
clearly
the
commissioner's
well-considered
and
longstanding
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it
is
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
in
fact,
there
was
a
very...
there
was
a
lengthy
comment
period,
and
then
they
went
through
the
entire
process
and
were
issued
quite
a
few
years
actually
after
the
comment
period
was
completed.
but
yes,
those
were
not...
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
justice
ginsburg.
in
fact,
the
clarification
came
in
in
response
to
a
public
comment
that
particular
issue
wasn't...
was
germane
to
the
rulemaking,
but
it
wasn't
one
the
commissioner
had
initially
planned
to
address.
but
a
commenter
said,
please
clarify
that
in
fact
you
do
consider
whether
previous
work
exists
in
the
national
economy.
and
the
commissioner
said,
no,
no,
you've
got
it
wrong.
we
do
not
consider
it.
our
longstanding
view
has
always
been
we
do
not
consider
whether
previous
work
exits
in
substantial
numbers
in
the
national
economy.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i...
the
respondent's
position
does
have
the
effect
of
completing
the
two
separate
inquiries.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
one
thing
that...
that
it
wouldn't
take
into
account
is
that
in
the
first
inquiry,
the
commissioner
does
not
take
into...
in
the
previous
work
inquiry,
the
commissioner
does
not
take
into
account
age,
education,
and
work
experience.
and
your
formulation
would
make
age,
education,
and
work
experience
relevant
to
all
work,
previous
work
and
past
work.
however,
we
believe
that
if
congress
had
intended--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i...
i
think
that's
precisely
right.
it
makes
it...
as
a--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
as
a
structural
matter,
it
would
make
it
relevant,
but
in
fact
it
would
be
rarely,
if
ever,
a
factor
the
commissioner
would
use
in
terms
of
denying
disability
benefits.
so
it
does
definitely
have
the
effect
of
taking
what
congress
set
out
as
two
separate
conditions
precedent
and
merging
them
to
a
degree
which
congress
probably
did
not
intend.
finally,
for
45
years
in
adjudicating
more
than
40
million
claims...
and
that
includes
approximately
200,000
step
four,
that
is,
previous
work
denials
a
year.
that's
500
denials
a
day
for
every
day
of
every
year...
the
commissioner
has
consistently
applied
this
construction.
that
construction
has
functioned
well
throughout
all
these
years.
accordingly,
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
reinstate
the
commissioner's
construction.
