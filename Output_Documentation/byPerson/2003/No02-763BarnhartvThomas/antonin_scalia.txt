clarify
something?

didn't

understand

his
answer.
do
you
understand
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case
to
be
anything
other
than
saying
that
the
statute
means
it
could
be
abbreviated
to
read
this
way,
that
he
is
unable,
considering
his
age,
education,
and
work
experience,
to
engage
in
any
kind
of
substantial,
gainful
work
which
subsists
in
the

justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
stated
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
social
security
act
provides
that
a
person
is
disabled
and
thereby
eligible
for
disability
insurance
benefits
and
supplemental
security
income
“only
if
his
physical
or
mental
impairment
or
impairments
are
of
such
severity
that
he
is
not
only
unable
to
do
his
previous
work
but
cannot,
considering
his
age,
education
and
work
experience,
engage
in
any
other
kind
of
substantial
gainful
work
which
exists
in
the
national
economy.”
the
respondent
here,
pauline
thomas,
was
denied
benefits
because
the
social
security
administration
concluded
that
she
was
able
to
perform
her
previous
work
as
an
elevator
operator.
rejecting
as
irrelevant
her
claim
that
that
particular
job
is
not
substantial
gainful
work
which
exists
in
the
national
economy,
a
phrase
that
is
defined
to
mean
work
which
exists
in
significant
numbers
either
in
the
region
where
the
claimant
lives
or
in
several
regions
of
the
country.
thomas
sought
review
of
the
administration’s
ruling
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
jersey
which
affirm
the
agency.
upon
her
appeal
however,
the
untied
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
and
ordered
the
case
remanded
to
the
agency.
in
the
third
circuit’s
view,
the
statutory
definition
of
disability
unambiguously
provides
that
a
claimant
is
disqualified
by
her
ability
to
do
her
previous
work
only
if
that
work
is
substantial
gainful
work
which
exists
in
the
national
economy.
we
granted
the
social
security
administration’s
petition
for
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
the
statutory
definition
of
disability
establishes
two
requirements:
first,
an
impairment
must
render
an
individual
unable
to
do
his
previous
work,
and
second,
it
must
also
preclude
him
from
“engaging
in
any
other
kind
of
substantial
gainful
work.”
now,
the
parties
agree
that
the
latter
requirement
is
qualified
by
the
clause
that
immediately
follows
it.
the
clause
reads
which
exists
in
the
national
economy.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
clause
also
qualifies
previous
work.
the
social
security
administration’s
regulations
answer
that
question
in
the
negative.
the
administration
will
find
not
disabled,
a
claimant
who
can
do
his
previous
work
without
inquiring
whether
those
work
exists
in
the
national
economy.
we
conclude
that
this
interpretation
is
a
reasonable
one
and
hence,
must
be
accorded
deference
under
chevron
versus
national
resources
defense
council.
the
agency’s
interpretation
accords
with
the
grammatical
so-called
rule
of
the
last
antecedent
according
to
which
a
limiting
clause
or
phrase,
here,
the
relative
clause
'which
exists
in
the
national
economy'
should
ordinarily
be
read
as
modifying
only
the
noun
or
phrase
that
it
immediately
follows.
here,
any
other
kind
of
substantial
gainful
work
and
not
the
earlier
possible
antecedent,
previous
work.
the
third
circuit
suggested
that
the
administration’s
interpretation
would
lead
to
absurd
results
because
a
claimant
maybe
denied
benefits
on
the
basis
on
a
finding
that
he
is
able
to
do
work
that
no
longer
exists.
but
this
conclusion
gives
too
little
credence
to
the
rational
offered
by
the
social
security
administration.
the
administration
considers
the
claimant’s
physical
and
mental
ability
to
perform
his
old
work.
a
proxy
for
the
claimant’s
capacity
to
perform
some
form
of
work
that
does
exists.
almost
all
of
the
time,
the
ability
to
do
one
job
will
demonstrate
the
ability
to
do
others.
such
a
proxy
is
useful
because
if
a
claimant
cannot
be
determined
not
disabled
by
reason
of
visibility
to
do
his
previous
job,
then
the
administration
must
proceed
to
the
more
difficult
and
time
consuming
inquiry
into
whether
given
the
claimant’s
age,
education,
and
work
experience,
his
cumulative
impairments
preclude
him
form
finding
other
work.
because
the
administration’s
interpretation
is
sensible
and
not
precluded
by
the
text
of
the
statute
is
entitled
to
deference
even
though
it
may
have
some
unfortunate
consequences
in
some
individual
cases.
the
third
circuit’s
interpretation,
we
point
out,
may
also
have
some
peculiar
consequences
since
it
would
give
benefits
to
an
impaired
worker
who
could
go
back
to
his
old
job
but
chooses
not
to,
if
that
particular
job
does
not
exists
in
substantial
numbers
in
the
economy.
for
these
reason,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court’s
decision
is
unanimous.
