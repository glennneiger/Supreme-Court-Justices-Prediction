mr.
phillips,
this
is
a
facial
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
claiming
total
preemption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
were
to
think
that
at
least
as
applied
to
the
district's
own
purchases
of
vehicles,
that
it
could
limit
itself
to
what
kinds
of
vehicles
it
wanted
to
purchase
and
therefore
is
valid
at
least
in
part?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
let's
suppose
it
wants
to
establish
a
standard
to
apply
now
and
in
the
future
for
itself
and
for
any
other
jurisdiction,
public
jurisdiction,
within
its
area?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it's
authorized
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
gets
me
back
to
my
question.
if
we
disagree
with
you,
to
the
extent
we
think
some
application
of
the
district's
fleet
rules
are
not
preempted,
then
how
does
that
leave
your
challenge,
which
is
a
facial
one?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but...
but,
mr.
olson,
why
can't
a
local
agency
or
community
decide
it's
going
to
buy
vehicles
and
will
buy
no
diesel
vehicles?
and
why
is
that
the
imposition
of
a
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
this
district
have
the
authority
to
so
provide
for
its
own
purchases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
have
authority
to...
to
make
that
requirement
for
cities
within
its
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
to
be
clear
on
your
position,
do
you
think
that
california
as
a
state
could
enact
a
law
saying
that
no
purchaser
of
a
motor
vehicle
in
california
can
purchase
a
gasoline-powered
vehicle?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that...
is
that
preempted
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
by
any
theory.
is
that
preempted
or
not
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
