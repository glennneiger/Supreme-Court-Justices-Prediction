justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
we
may...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
local
jurisdictions.
i
mean,
you
know,
what's
that?
are
you
saying
that
it
is
a
standard
if
the
city
of
los
angeles
has
a
regulation
through
the
city
council
that
applies
to
the
purchasing
of
every
little
local
area?
or
suppose
the
state
of
california
has
a
general
regulation
respecting
only
governmental
purchases.
are
you
saying
right
now
that
all
those...
in
other
words,
rules,
regulations,
standards,
practices
by
the
state
of
california
or
some
part
thereof...
that
does
nothing
more
than
control
purchasing
by
governmental
units
of
that
state
is
fine?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
that
case
we're
now
down
to
the
possibility
that
we're
talking
about
some
garbage
trucks,
i
think,
and
some
airport
vehicles
because
i
think
all
the
rest
of
it
did
just
involve
the
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can,
can
you
not...
i'm
just
trying
to
draw
this
back
because
it
seems
to
me
you're
not
challenging
the
public
part.
so
if
you're
not
challenging
the
public
part,
then...
i've
looked
at
pages
7
and
8
of
the
sg's
brief
where
he's
listed
these
rules.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
take
it
what
you're
challenging
is
rule
1194
insofar
as
it
applies
to
private
operators.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rule
1193,
the
same,
and
rule
1186.1,
the
same,
and
nothing
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
each
of
those
rules,
having
looked
at
them,
it
does
say
at
the
beginning,
these
apply
to
public
and
private.
so
i
take
it
it's
those
two
words,
and
private,
written
in
the
text
of
those
rules
that
you're
challenging.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
that's
what
you're
challenging,
nothing
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean?
another
public
or
private?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
now
just
let's
think...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
the
complexity
of
state
and
central
government
in
light
of
what
you
just
said.
you're
saying
that
the
state
of
california
board
a
couldn't
say
all
the...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
where
to
go
with
this.
do
you
see...
do
you
see
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
problem
is
to
try
to
figure
out
what's
being
challenged.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
its...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
california
passes
a
law
and
says
no
one
can
sell
a
diesel
bus
in
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
clearly
you'd
have
to
go
get
permission
if
you
want
a
rule
like
that.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
rule
is
exactly
what
i
said:
no
one
can
sell
a
diesel
bus
in
california
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm...
for
purposes
of
my
question,
i'm
rejecting
that
argument.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
is
the
correct
way
of
dealing
with
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
where
i
was
going,
if
you
want
to
see,
i'll
show
you
because
then
you...
it...
it
seems
to
me
clearly
you'd
have
to
ask
question...
nobody
can
sell
a
diesel
bus
in
california.
you
have
to
get
permission
from
epa.
second,
they
change
it.
no
one
can
buy
a
diesel
bus.
all
right?
it's
the
same.
third,
they
say
no
governmental
unit
can
buy
a
diesel
bus,
but
it
turns
out
that
the
only
buses
anyone
has
ever
bought
or
sold
in
california
are
diesel
units.
and
it's
at
that
third
point
that's
bothering
me
because
it
seems
to
me
whether
it's
preempted
or
not
turns
upon
the
effects.
have
you,
in
effect,
required
the
manufacturer
to
change
its
assembly
line
or
not?
and
i
don't
know
where
to
go
with
that.
that's
what
i'm
posing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nobody
can
buy
a
gasoline-powered
vehicle
in
california
would
require
the
manufacturers
totally
to
dramatically
change
the
kinds
of
vehicles
they
produce.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
wouldn't
it
fall
right
within
the
word
standard
relating
to
the
control
of
emissions
for
motor
vehicles?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
a
standard?
what
it
says
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
a
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
breyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
you
to
finish
what
you're
doing,
but
i
want
at
some
point
to
get
back
to
this
effectiveness...
the
effect
thing.
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
i'll...
do
it
in
the
order
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
it
in
the
order
you
want
and
you
can
just
that
i've
just
been
off
base,
and
i'll
put
out
the
three
propositions
that...
that
i'm
thinking.
now,
you'll
see
it
in
a
second.
i'm
thinking,
one,
this
case
isn't
a
big
deal
because
all
california
has
to
do
is
go
ask
epa
and
epa
is
almost
bound
to
approve
whatever
they
want.
two,
that
you
can't
do
it
on
language,
that
you
have
to
figure
out
the
purpose.
the
purpose
is
to
stop
the
manufacturers
from
having
to
make
different
cars,
and
therefore,
why
don't
you,
in
these
circumstances,
look
to
the
effect?
and...
and
if
in
fact
the
effect
is
that
they're
going
to
have
to
make
some
different
cars,
it's
no
good.
but
all
the
examples
you
give
in
your
brief,
all
those
things
are
fine.
they
don't...
they
don't
involve
this
and...
and
they're
not
commands.
you
have
to
go
the
command
and
have
an
effect.
this
is
a
command.
and
i
don't
think
it
does
have
an
effect,
nor
do
you,
but
they
think
it
might.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
that's...
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that's
going
through
my
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
you've
sort
of
said,
no,
no,
you're
way
off
base,
and
i
want
to
know
why
i'm
way
off
base.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
determined
what
congress'
purpose
is
by
the
effect.
you
have
things
that
you're
talking
about,
standards
telling
the...
the
manufacturers
what
to
do,
and
then
you
have
close-to
things,
things
not
quite
that,
but
close
to
that,
selling,
purchasing.
so
there,
where
it's
a
command
in
this
slightly
different
form,
we
look
to
see
whether
it
really
has
the
effect
that
the
statute
is
aimed
at
preventing.
and
if
so,
go
to
the
epa
and
ask
them.
if
not,
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
that's
completely
wrong
in
principle
for
the
reason
that
the
rules
don't
talk
about
commercial
availability
but
in
averages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
fact,
if
they're
only
supposed
to
make
three
zev's...
see,
they're
only
supposed
to
make
three
zev's.
zev
is
commercially
available.
but
you
could
have
a
rule
say
buy
only
zev's
and
that
would
be
a
major
change
in
the
epa
rule.
