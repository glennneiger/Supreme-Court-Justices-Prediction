mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1967,
congress
enacted
section
209(a)
of
the
clean
air
act,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
petitioners'
brief
at
page
1.
that
statute
prohibits
states
and
their
localities
from
adopting
or
attempting
even
to
enforce,
quote,
any
standard
relating
to
the
control
of
emissions
from
new
motor
vehicles
or
new
motor
vehicle
engines.
in
this
case,
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
california
has
adopted
fleet
rules
that
prohibit
the
purchase
by
certain
fleets
of
various
classes
of...
of
vehicles
that
are
otherwise
certified
for
purchase
in
the
state
of
california
and,
indeed,
have
essentially
precluded
the
purchase
by
those
organizations
of
diesel-fueled
vehicles
in
toto.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
claiming
total
preemption.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the...
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
one,
the
district
doesn't
need
a
statute
in
order
to
purchase
its
own
vehicles.
there
is
no
basis
for
adopting
a
standard
that
controls
that
particular
situation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
it
goes
beyond...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
it
goes
beyond
what
it
wants
to
purchase
itself
and
imposes
requirements
on
others,
then
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
standard
that
falls
within
the
ambit
of
the
preemption.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that...
that
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
that
would
be
preempted.
i...
i
don't
think
it's
presented,
obviously,
by
the
particulars
of
this
case.
i
mean,
it
still
look...
sounds
like
a...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
at
the
end
of
the
day,
justice
kennedy,
would
be
that
you
would
require
a
clearer
statement
from
congress
than
what
you
have
in
section
209(a)
to
interfere
with
the
kind
of
purchasing
decisions
that
localities
are...
are
making
in
contrast
to
this.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
understand
that,
justice
scalia.
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
one
that
i
was
trying
to
answer
before
which
is
i
don't
think
that
this
provision
actually
covers
that
particular
situation
because
you
don't
need
this
provision
in
order
to
have
authority
as
a
local
jurisdiction
to
make
purchases
on
your
own
as
to
what
you're
going
to
buy.
that's
not,
i
don't
think,
a
standard
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
but
second
of
all,
i
also
don't
think
that
the...
it
must
be
unconstitutional
in
all
respects
as
the
controlling
standard
of
law
in
this
particular
context
either.
it
is
clear
that
there
is
a
significant
component
of
this...
of
these
fleet
rules
that
is
preempted,
and
perhaps
all
of
them
are
preempted.
but
we
were
dismissed
out
at
the
earliest
stages
of
these
proceedings
without
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
the
metes
and
bounds
of
the
regulations
as
they
would
particularly
apply
at
this...
at...
at
this
particular
juncture.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
our...
our
challenge
is
not
intended,
frankly,
to
interfere
with
the
local
jurisdiction's
ability
to
purchase
their
own
vehicles
on
their
own
behalf.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
that's
what
we're
saying.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
don't...
we
don't
have
any
challenge
to
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
difficult
to
know
precisely
what
the
metes
and
bounds
of
it
is,
but
the
portion
of
this
that
offends
us
and
the
portion
that
we
think
does
not
require
a
clearer
statement,
which
is
that
which
goes
directly
to
non-governmental
entities.
if...
if
you're
talking
about
regulating
the
purchasing
choices
of
pure
governmental
entities,
then
you
expect
congress
to
speak
with
a...
with
a
clearer
voice.
but
the
purpose
of
these
fleet
rules
is
not
simply
to
restrict
the
purchases
by
governmental
entities.
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
purpose
of
these
fleet
rules
is
to
regulate
the
purchasing
choices
that
are
made
with
respect
to
a
much
broader
scope
of
purchasing
entities,
including
private
entities,
and
it
is
that
portion
of
the
regulation,
frankly,
that
we
are
challenging
and
challenging
on
its
face.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
assuming,
justice
ginsburg,
that
you...
that
california
took...
complied
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
section
246,
and
there
are
specific
requirements
in
order
to
get
a...
in
the...
in
the
state
action
plan
that...
state
implementation
plan
that
need
to
be
satisfied.
but
to
be
sure,
the
congress
clearly
envisioned
that
for
states
with
nonattainment
problems,
that
they
would
be
able
to
use
fleet
restrictions
as
a
mechanism
for
promoting
their
overall
emissions
quality.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
providing
you
comply
with
the
standards
of
section
246.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
precise
terms
of
this...
of
these
rules
would
qualify
under
section
246
or
not.
nobody
has
actually
analyzed
that
point,
but
the
truth
is
it's
clear
that
you
could
have
certain
fleet
rules
implemented
that
are
consistent
with
section
246.
but
realize,
justice
ginsburg,
that
what...
by
saying
all
our
concern
is
is
that
every...
every
one
of
thousands
of
jurisdictions
can
impose
purchase
and
sale
requirements
on
vehicles...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
under
the
respondents'
theory
of
this
case
which
limits
the
term
standards
to
production
mandates
imposed
on
manufacturers,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
clearly
extends
to
all
purchases
and
sales
and
whether
it
extends
to
fleets,
it
wouldn't...
it's
not
limited
to
fleets
at
all.
under
the
respondents'
theory
of
this
case,
the
field
that
has
been
preempted
here
really
is
limited
to
the
manufacturers.
and
to
allow
every
local
jurisdiction
to
come
in
and
bring
forth
additional
requirements
is
to
make
a
hash
out
of
a
scheme
that
was
clearly
designed
to
create
a
unitary
market
for
the
manufacture,
sale,
purchase,
and
licensing
of
new
motor
vehicles.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
you
can't
analyze
a
preemption
case
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
single
action
by
a
single
actor,
that
in
fact
you
have
to
consider
the
possibility
that
all
50
states
or,
in
this
case,
every
local
jurisdiction
could
follow
suit.
and
remember,
it's
not
just
follow
suit
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
fleet
rules
under
the
respondents'
theory
of
this
case,
which
is
that
all
purchase
and
sale
restrictions...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
state
of
california
would
have
certain
prerogatives,
obviously,
under
the
entire
scheme
that
are
different,
but
even
if
california
had
simply
done
what
the
district
did
here,
which
is
to
just
announce
a
set
of
fleet
rules,
not
made
any
effort
to
comply
with
246,
not
made
any
effort
to
comply
with
section
209(b)...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
section
246
provides
that
in
certain
nonattainment
states,
one
of
the
options
they
have
available
in
order
to
eliminate
the
overall...
or
to...
to
improve
the
overall
ambient
air
quality
is
to
adopt
certain
types
of
fleet
rules.
and
the
provision
is
very
lengthy.
it's
very
detailed
about...
and
you
have
to
include
that
in
your
state
implementation
plan.
what
california
did
was
it
used
the
substitute
route
and
adopted
its
lev
rules
saying
that
those
would
be
equally
effective.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
it
clearly
didn't
comply.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
california
has
made
no
effort
to
satisfy
the
clean
air
act
with
respect
to
this.
but
this
court...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that's
absolutely
clear.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
that's...
and
that's
part
of
the
way
this
entire
scheme
operates.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i...
i
think
the
answer
is
that
there
are
various
components
of
the
fleet
rules,
and
i
think
unlike
if
you're...
if
you're
seeking
pre-enforcement
of
a
statute,
where
you'd
have
to
find
every
application
of
it,
the
question
is
are
there
subcomponents
of
these
rules
that
are
properly
challengeable
and
therefore
properly
enjoinable
rather
than
being
allowed
to
go
in.
i
don't...
i
don't
understand...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that
because
what
you're
really
talking
about
is
a...
is
a
host
of
rules.
and
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
to
the
respondents'
brief
with
all
of
the
rules
that
are
laid
out
there,
there
are
literally
dozens
of
rules.
and
in
order
to
challenge
the,
quote,
fleet
rules
in
the
sense
of
recognizing
that
there
are
clearly
areas
of
those
rules
that
intrude
into
preempted
federal
activities,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
have
to
challenge
the
entirety
of
the
rules.
you
should
be
entitled
to
pick
those
rules
that
you're
going
after
and
a
complaint
and
go
forward.
and
that's...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
what
we've
done.
i
understand
if
you
have
a
simple
unitary
statute
that
you're
challenging,
the
salerno
rule
may
suggest
that
the
statute
has
to
be
unconstitutional
in
all
its
respects,
but
if
you
adopted
a
rule
that
if
part
a
is
good
and
part
b
is
not
good,
you
should
be
allowed
to...
to
challenge
part
b
facially
without
worrying
about
part
a.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
my
answer
to
you
is
i
don't
think
that's
the
proper
application
of
salerno
and
i
don't...
i
mean,
i
recognize...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
except
for
the
fact
that
if...
if
we
don't
get
past
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
at
this
stage,
which
is
that
none
of
this
is
preempted,
that...
whether
it's
a
facial
challenge
or
a
non-facial
challenge,
we're
going
to
have
rules
that
are
out
there
that
are
being
implemented
at
this
stage
and
will
be
upheld
as
constitutional
under
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
as
the...
as
the
controlling
rule
of
law,
and
we
won't
be
in
a
position
even
to
get
at
any
portion
of
those
rules
that
are
clearly
unconstitutional
because
they...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that...
that
is
our...
i
mean,
our
primary
concern.
the...
the
problem
here
is...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
i
mean,
the
question
is
whether
or
not...
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
that
is
precisely
what
we're
challenging.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
difference
between
a
public
entity
deciding
on
its
own...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
it
will
make
a
certain
purchasing
decision
as
a
purchasing
decision.
there
is
a
fundamentally
different
proposition
when
another
entity
demands
that
it
must
make
a
purchasing
decision
based
on
emissions
control.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
a
public
entity.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
what
i
was
saying
is...
what...
what
i
meant
to
answer
your
question
earlier,
justice
breyer,
was
to
say
if
you're
asking
me
can
public
entities
make
purchasing
decisions
free
of
the
restrictions
of
the
clean
air
act,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes
because
i
don't
think
congress
spoke
to
that.
but
if
what
you're
saying
is
can
a...
can
one
governmental
entity
demand
that
another
governmental
entity
make
a
decision
for
purely
environmental
reasons
and
not
as
a...
as
a
contracting
matter,
no.
that
seems
to
me
is
still
a
standard...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
controls
emissions
and
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but
the...
the
problem
is
much
simpler
than
that,
justice
breyer,
because
there's
a
scheme
in
place
where
if
you
don't
like
the
way
the
regulatory
arrangements
are
worked
out,
you
can
take
the
issue
to
california
and
california
can
take
it
to
the
epa.
i
mean,
the
whole
purpose
of
this
enterprise
was
to
devise
a
unitary
market
and
make
it
very
simple.
and
there's
nothing
in
the...
in
the
suggestion
that...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we're
challenging
the
effort
by
the
district
to
impose
these
kinds
of
requirements,
these
standards
which
control
emissions.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
on
everyone.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
that's
what
the
clean
air
act
is
all
about.
california
is
free
to
do
that
if
it
complies
with
section
209(b)
which
says
you
can
obtain
a
waiver.
you
can
make
these
the
federal
standards.
i
mean,
there's
no
question
that
these
fleet
rules
could
have
been
adopted
by
the
state
of
california
and
be
approved
by
the
epa
and
be
operating
completely
tomorrow
if
they
want
to
go
through
that
process.
that's
the
specific
process
congress
had
in
mind,
a
process
that
the
district
has
abandoned.
and
all
we're
suggesting
is
that's
what
they
ought
to
do.
mr.
phillips,
i
don't
want
to
intrude
into
your
time,
but
i...
i
hope
you
have
time
to
comment
on
your
adversary's
argument
that
the
word
standards
just
refers
to
numerical
figures
and
so
forth
and
that
you...
you
have
a...
it
means
the
same
thing
when
the
government
is...
federal
government
is
implementing
its
own
issues
and
it
is
in
this
provision.
do
you...
do
you
have
a
response
to
that
basic
argument?
so
there...
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
one,
section
202
is
not
limited
to
production
mandates,
those
kinds
of
numerical
standards,
even...
even
within
202.
and
second,
the
language
that...
that
congress
used
about
standards
relating
to
the
control
of
emissions
is
inherently
broader
than
202
in
any
event,
and
if
you
expected
209
and
202
to
be
read
in
para
materia,
you
would
have
expected
congress
to
cross
reference.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
were
enacted
at
different
times.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
use
of
requirement
in
the
second
sentence
is
simply
a
recognition
that
there
could
be
standardless
requirements
imposed
by
states
requiring
a
certification
or
some
other
kind
of
documentation
that
don't
have
standards.
so
the
first
sentence
deals
with
standards
and
the
second
one
deals
with
standardless
obstacles
to
implementation.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
start
with
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical.
we
are
told
in
language
that
i
think
a
6-year-old
would
have
a
hard
time
understanding
that
a
flat
ban
on
all
gasoline-fueled
engines
in
the
state
of
california
is
not
a
standard
relating
to
the
control
of
emissions
from
new
motor
vehicles
or
new
motor
vehicle
engines.
justice
kennedy
is
absolutely
right.
it
has
rendered
the
scope
of
preemption.
there
is
no
field
of
preemption.
there
is
not
even
a
divot
of
dirt
of
preemption
that
is
created
under
that
interpretation.
it's
not
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
word
standard.
standard
means
more
than
what
manufacturers
do.
it's
not
simply
how
it
gets
enforced.
it's
broader,
and
justice
stevens
is
clearly
correct
in
that
regard.
the
one
provision
that
seems
to
have
gotten
lost
in
the...
in
all
of
this,
which
i
think
is
terribly
important,
is
section
177
which
states
that
state...
and
this
is
at
the...
the
respondents'
brief's
appendix
at
4a...
4a.
the
states
are
not
authorized
to
prohibit
or
limit
directly
or
indirectly
the
manufacture
or
sale
of
a
new
motor
vehicle
or
motor
vehicle
engine
that
is
certified
in
california.
that
is
precisely
what
is
being
done
here,
is
that
vehicles
that
are
certified
in
california
are
prohibited
by
a
subagency.
the
state
can't
even
do
this,
which
is
why
i
submit
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
is
the
state
wouldn't
have
the
authority
to
place
the
kind
of
restriction
on
its
own
subentities
without
running
afoul
of
section
177.
and
the
only
way
california
could
get
approval
for
that
would
be
to
go
to
the
epa
in
the
way
that
justice
breyer
has
already
described.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
i
believe
epa
is
very
much
with
us
this
morning
because
the
solicitor
general
speaks
for
the
united
states,
and
epa
is
clearly
a
part
of
the
united
states
government.
and...
and
the
epa
has
made
it
absolutely
clear,
justice
ginsburg...
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
absolutely
that's
just
wrong.
there
is
no...
there
is
no
way...
i
have
seen
nothing
to
justify
departing
from
what
the
government's
brief
says.
