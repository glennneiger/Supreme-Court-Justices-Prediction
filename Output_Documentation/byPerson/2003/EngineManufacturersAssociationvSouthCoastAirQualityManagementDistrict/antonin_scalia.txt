right,
but...
but
it
seems
to
me
not...
not
an
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
concern
to
say
that
it
goes
beyond
the
particulars
of
this
case
because
when
you
make
a
facial
challenge,
you
are
going
beyond
the
particulars
of
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
eliminates
the
doctrine
entirely,
i
mean,
the
doctrine
that
facial
challenge
has
to
show
the
statute
is...
is
invalid
in
all
its
applications.
you
could
always
say,
well,
we're
not
challenging
all
of
its
applications.
we're...
we're
just
challenging
this
particular
set
of
applications.
i
mean,
that...
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
justice
antonin
scalia
general
olson,
does...
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
petitioner
has
just
taken,
that
these
rules
are
invalid
even
insofar
as
they
apply
to
governmental
subdivisions
in
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
their
doing
of
it
is
unconstitutional.
whether
the
state's...
whether
the
state's
prescribing
that
they
do
it
violates
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe,
but
most
of
what
it
covers
is
simply
the...
the
purchase
by
governmental
units.
if
you
acknowledge
that
the
state
can
require
its
subdivisions
to...
to
purchase
only
certain
kinds
of
vehicles,
as
you've
just
acknowledged,
why
can't
the
state
create
a
district
as
here
and
allow
that
district
to
require...
justice
antonin
scalia
subdivisions
to
purchase
only...
justice
antonin
scalia
just
so
i
have
it
clear,
because
it...
this
is
very
important
to
me.
it's
your
position
that
the
state
may
require
municipalities
only
to
buy
certain
kinds
of
cars.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
the
same
problem,
if
i
could
second
it.
it
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
you
use
standard
99
times
in
discussing
manufacturing
standards
doesn't
mean
that
when
you
use
it
a
100th
time
to
refer
to
some
other
aspect
of
the
whole
thing,
it
must
refer
to
manufacturing.
it
just
doesn't
follow.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you
say
it's
not
just
manufacturers.
it's
manufacturers
and
sellers.
i
thought
it
was
just
manufacturers.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it...
it's
hard
enough
to
say
that
the
word
standards
on
its
own
is
automatically
limited
to
manufacturers,
but
it's
doubly
hard
to
say
it
is
limited
not
to
just
to
manufacturers,
but
to
manufacturers
and
sellers,
but
not
to
manufacturers,
sellers,
and
purchasers.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's...
what's
that
13th
chime?
i
lost
you.
i
thought
you
said...
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
know.
i
know
what
it
is.
where
is
it?
at
page...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
reply,
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
because?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is
a...
what...
what
do
you
do
with
209(b)
which
says...
it...
it
authorizes
epa
to
waive
application
of
209(a)
in
the
case
of,
quote,
any
state
which
has
adopted
standards,
other
than
crank
case
emission
standards,
for
the
control
of
emissions
from
new
motor
vehicles
or
new
motor
vehicle
engines?
now,
most
of
the
states
do
not
have
automobile
manufacturers
located
within
the
states.
how
could
they
possibly
impose
a
requirement
on
automobile
manufacturers?
it
is
obviously
referring
to
state
standards
that
deal
with
the
operators
of...
of
cars...
you
have
to
go
in
and...
and
have
your...
your
emissions
checked...
or
the...
or
the
purchases
of
cars.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
understand
your
response
to
my
question.
my
question
is...
you
just
said
again,
that
standards
always
refer
to
manufacturing
standards.
but
in
209(b),
they
clearly
do
not
refer
to
manufacturing
standards.
any
state
which
has
adopted
standards
for
the
control
of
emissions
from
new
motor
vehicles
or
new
motor
vehicle
engines.
those
standards
are...
are
just
not
applied
to
the
manufacturer.
most
states
don't
have
manufacturers
that
they
can
control.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
standards
are
imposed
at
the
purchase...
or
at
the
operations
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
imposed
upon
the
users?
justice
antonin
scalia
virginia
cannot
impose
them
upon
the
users
of
cars
in
virginia?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
this
provision
in
209(b)
does
not
authorize
a
state
to
conduct
emissions
tests
of
old
vehicles
that
have
already
been
sold.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
manufacturers,
nothing
to
do
with
sellers
at
this
point.
it
has
to
do
with
whether
the
user
is
keeping
the
emissions
system
in...
in
proper
operation.
you
say
that
is
not
covered
by
209(b)
because
209(b)
does...
does
not
say
requirements.
it
says
standards.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
try
it
out.

i

02-1343
engine
manufacturer’s
association
versus
south
coast
air
quality
management
district.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
south
coast
air
quality
management
district,
the
political
subdivision
of
california
responsible
for
air
pollution
control
in
the
los
angeles’
metropolitan
area,
enacted
six
fleet
rules
prohibiting
the
purchase
or
lease
by
various
public
and
private
fleet
operators
of
vehicles
that
do
not
comply
with
specified
emission
related
requirements.
these
rules
generally
require
the
purchase
or
lease
of
alternative-fuel
vehicle
so-called
or
vehicles
that
need
certain
emission
specifications
established
by
the
california
air
resources
board.
all
six
rules
apply
to
public
operators.
three
apply
to
private
operators
as
well.
the
petitioner,
engine
manufacturer’s
association
sued
the
district
and
its
officials
claiming
the
fleet
rules
were
preempted
by
section
209(a)
of
the
federal
clean
air
act
which
prohibits
the
adaption
or
intended
enforcement
of
any
state
or
local
“standard
relating
to
the
control
of
emissions
from
new
motor
vehicles
or
new
motor
vehicle
engines.”
in
upholding
the
rules,
the
district
court
found
that
section
209(a)
did
not
preempt
them
because
the
rules
regulated
only
the
purchase
of
vehicles
that
are
otherwise
certified
for
sale
in
california.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari,
and
now
vacate
and
remand.
the
first
sentence
of
section
209(a)
provides
that
“no
state
or
political
subdivision
thereof
shall
adapt
or
attempt
to
enforce
any
standard
relating
to
the
control
of
emissions
from
new
motor
vehicles
and
new
motor
vehicle
engines."
the
lower
court’s
determination,
that
this
express
preemption
provision
did
not
require
invalidation
of
the
fleet
rules
hinged
upon
their
interpretation
of
the
word
"standard"
to
include
only
regulations
that
compel
manufacturers
to
meet
specific
emission
limits.
sales
restrictions,
they
recognized,
do
this,
but
purchase
restrictions,
they
said,
do
not.
the
fundamental
difficulty
with
this
analysis
is
that
it
confuses
standards
with
the
means
of
enforcing
standards.
standards
in
section
209(a)
are
criteria
that
relate
to
the
emission
characteristics
of
a
vehicle
or
engine.
to
meet
them,
the
vehicle
or
engine
must
emit
no
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
a
given
pollutant,
must
be
equipped
with
a
certain
type
of
pollution
control
device,
or
must
have
some
other
design
feature
related
to
emissions.
restrictions
on
the
manufacture,
purchase,
or
sale
of
non-compliant
vehicles
are
not
themselves
standards
which
target
vehicles
and
engines
but
rather
methods
of
standard
enforcement
which
target
manufacturers,
sellers,
and
purchasers.
the
clean
air
act
itself
contains
provisions
that
make
use
of
both
purchase
and
sales
restrictions
to
enforce
standards
relating
to
the
control
of
emissions.
both
types
of
restriction
can
constitute
attempts
to
enforce
standards
preempted
by
209(a).
moreover,
it
would
make
no
sense
to
treat
sale
and
purchase
restrictions
differently
for
preemption
purposes,
as
the
district
court
would
have,
since
the
manufacturer’s
right
to
sell
federally
approved
vehicles
is
meaningless
in
the
absence
of
a
purchaser’s
right
to
buy
them.
for
these
and
other
reasons
given
in
opinion
today
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
hold
that
the
south
coast
district’
fleet
rules
do
not
escape
preemption
under
209(a)
of
the
clean
air
act
solely
because
they
address
the
purchase
of
vehicle
rather
than
their
manufacture
or
sale.
our
interpretation
of
209(a)
renders
it
likely
that
at
least
certain
aspects
of
the
fleet
rules
are
preempted.
we
have
not
addressed
however
a
number
of
issues
that
were
neither
passed
on
below
nor
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
but
which
may
bear
on
the
ultimate
disposition
of
petitioner’s
suit.
therefore,
we
remand
the
case
for
the
lower
courts
to
address
these
issues
in
light
of
the
principles
set
forth
in
our
opinion.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
