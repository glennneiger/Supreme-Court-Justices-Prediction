mr.
carter,
if
these
regulations
had
been
adopted
by
the
state
of
california
rather
than
a
regional
district
as
its
246,
in...
in
lieu
of
the
federal
plan,
would
that
have
been
permissible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
objection
is
to
this
on
a
regional
basis.
statewide
you
say
is
permissible
provided
you
follow...
i
guess
you
need
epa
approval?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
so...
but
the
substance
of
it
would
be
okay
statewide.
so...
so...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
happened,
general
olson?
one
pier
that
you
raise
is
if...
that...
if
this
district
can
have
these
fleet
rules,
so
can
every
district
in
the
country,
and
these...
these
rules
have
been
in
operation
now
for
some
years.
have
other
districts
in
other
states
copied
what
this
one
has
done?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
olson,
you
mentioned
that
there
are
federal
vehicles
involved,
postal
vehicles,
but
you
also
are
stressing
purchase.
suppose
the
federal
government
buys
its
vehicles
that
it's
going
to
operate
in
california
in
nevada.
these
rules
wouldn't
apply.
so
the...
the
united
states
is
not
inhibited
in
any
way
in
its
purchases,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
carter,
mr.
waxman
said
in
his
brief
that
the
position
he's
taking
is
the
position
that
epa
takes,
and
epa
is
not
with
us
this
morning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you...
you
say
that's
just
wrong
when...
