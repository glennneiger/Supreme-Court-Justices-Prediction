justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if...
what
if
the
state...
what
if
the
state
of
california
says
that
all
of
our
officials,
including
the
governor,
shall
have
a
low
emissions
vehicle?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
it
is
from...
from
the
standpoint
of...
of
governmentally
owned
and
operated
vehicles.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
still
not
sure...
sure
where
we
are.
it...
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
regulation
talks
about
some
private
vehicles,
trash
hauling
and
airport
shuttles,
but
it
also
talks
about
exclusively
governmentally
owned
vehicles.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
state
can
do
whatever
it
has...
whatever
standard
it
wants
for
its
own
vehicles.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
if
one
local
jurisdiction
affects
other
governmental
jurisdictions,
but
the
latter
don't
care,
then
it's
just
as
if,
as
the
hypothetical
just
posed,
the
state
had
the...
had...
had
the
rule.
is
there
sort
of
an
ultra
vires
component
to
your
argument
that
this...
that
this
district
here
is
affecting
what
other
governmental
entities
can
do
and
that's
the
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
merits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
california...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
california
accepts
that
as
a
matter
of
its
domestic
law,
who
are
we
to
say
otherwise?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
the
separate
states
could
do
that
for
its
own
purchases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
could
they
also
do
that
for
all
their
governmental
subdivisions?
the
state
of
nebraska
says
that
the
state
and
all
of
its
subdivisions
will
have
some
very
strict
standards...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
need...
if
you
need
conflict
preemption
to
answer
such
a
basic
hypothetical
as
that
put
by
justice
o'connor,
the
statute
doesn't
mean
very
much.
