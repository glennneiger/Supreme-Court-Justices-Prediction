because
they
were
enacted
at
different
times,
i
think,
the
two
sections.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
waxman,
can
i
interrupt
you
just
a
moment?
you
say
there
are
obligations
that
are
placed
on
the...
which
is
also
true.
but
the
word
standard
as
used
in
the
statute
over
and
over
again
refers
to
things
that
are
express
in
terms
of
so
many
units
per
mile
and
so
many...
so
forth
and
so
on.
the
term
standard,
it
seems
to
me,
refers
to
the...
the
numerical
definitions
rather
than
to
how
they're
enforced
or
implied.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
may
well
be
they're...
and...
and
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
enforced
or
implied
in
the
terms
that
a
statute
because
all
it
has
to
be
that...
the
only
prohibition
is
against
anything
relating
to
a
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
standard
is
limited
to
the
numerical
term...
i
don't
find
in
the
text
of
the...
of
any
part
of
the
statute
here
your...
your
point
about
enforcement
against.
that's...
that's
what...
what
is
done
with
the
standard.
it's
not
what
the
standard
itself
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree
with
you
completely
that
the
statute
imposes
these
obligations
on
the
manufacturers
to
comply
with
the
standards.
but
the
word
standard
is...
is
a
different
concept
from
the
obligation
to
comply
with
the
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
covered
by
209(b)
because
209(b)
is
a
limitation
on
(a)
and
(a)
only
talks
about
new
vehicles.
so
you
could
get
around
this
whole
thing
if
california
adopted
a
rule
that
said
any
vehicle
6
years...
6
months
old
has
to
meet
certain
standards.
the
whole
statute
wouldn't
apply.
