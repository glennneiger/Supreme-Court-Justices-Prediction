mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
had
not
understood
your
argument
to
be
based
on
any
conception
that
this
particular
district
would
be
treated
differently
than
the
state
as
a
whole,
but
i...
i...
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
does...
what
does
246
provide?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
didn't
comply
in
your
view
with
246.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
matter
of
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
can't...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
mr.
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
go
to
epa.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
as
soon
as
there's...
as
soon
as
there's
one
commercial
vehicle
available,
that's
going
to
have
effect
on
the
manufacturing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you...
and
you
have
to
get...
apply
for
an
exemption
which
the
petitioner
says
is
very
difficult
to
get.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
its
own,
you
mean
fleets
that
were
going
to
serve
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
could
not
apply
directly
to
epa.
it
would
have
to
go
through
sacramento?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
on
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
