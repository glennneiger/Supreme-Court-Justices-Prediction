mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
south
coast
rules
prohibit
the
purchase
of
certain
motor
vehicles
and
require
the
purchase
of
others
based
on
explicit
emission
standards.
under
respondents'
reasoning,
every
other
state
and
local
government
agency
in
the
united
states
could
adopt
its
own
individual
and
unique
blend
of
prohibited
and
permitted
motor
vehicles.
but...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
the
answer
is...
is
no,
but
let
me
explain,
that
to
the
extent
that
agencies
of
government,
the
state
or
subdivisions,
are
purchasing
their
own
vehicles,
we
do
not
contend
that
that
is
unconstitutional.
they
can
purchase...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
our...
our
position...
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
that
because
i
don't
know
what
authority
this
agency
has
with
respect
to
requiring
different
units
of...
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
california
to
purchase
or
not
purchase
vehicles.
and
it
hasn't...
it's
not
a
subject
that
was
briefed,
if
at
all,
extensively
in
the
briefs.
but
the...
the
force...
the
force
of
the
preemption
provision
here
is
that
congress
determined
that
there
should
be
a
uniform
standard
with
respect
to
controls
on
the
emissions
of
motor
vehicles.
california
was
given
an
exception
provided
that
certain
requirements
were
met.
this
is
in
section
209(b)
that
these
provisions
be
submitted
to
the
epa
and
approved
under
a
process
that's
open
and
transparent
and
allows
the
national
agency
to
make
sure
that
there
are
uniform
standards
that
can
be
met
that
also
comply
with
the
requirement
that
the
national
economy
not
be
disrupted,
so
that
there
would
be
different...
by
different
standards
in
every
little
community
of
the
united
states.
that's
the
thrust...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
not
that
i
know
of.
they've...
they've
only
been
in
existence
since
the
year
2000.
the...
the
district
was
given
the
authority
to
adopt
these
rules
in
1987,
if
i'm
correct,
did
not
adopt
them
until
the
year
2000.
the
arguments...
the
principal
arguments
that
are
made
by
respondents
that
standards
are
production
mandates
finds
no
basis
in
the
statute.
the
language
of
section
202
or
section
209
is
not
so
limited.
the...
what...
what
section
202
and
209
do,
talk
about
emission
levels
or
emission
standards.
and
there
should
be
no
mistake
about
it.
these
fleet
rules
are
directly
related
to
emission
standards.
one
of
them,
for
example,
rule
1194,
uses
the
phrase,
emission
standards,
12
times
and
it
requires
all
purchasers
to
be
vehicles
that
meet
certain
emission
standards,
adopting
by
reference
the
state
of
california
carb
rules.
it
picked
out
a
subset,
as
the
respondents
put
it,
of
one
in
column
a,
two
in
column
b,
no
diesel.
there
must
be
some
clean
fuel.
it's
another...
it's
a
totally
different
package.
and
palm
beach
county
or...
or
waco...
the
city
of
waco
could
do
something
exactly
like
what
the
respondents
are
contending
because
they
say
the
controls
with
respect
to
emissions
don't
apply
if
they're
purchasing
requirements.
epa,
in
fact,
enforces
the
standards
that
it
adopts
under
section
202
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
203
by
restricting
the
sale
or
introduction
into
commerce
of
motor
vehicles
and
under
section
219,
under
certain
circumstances,
the
purchasers
of
fleets,
bus
fleets.
so
the
implementation
of
the
limitations
that...
that...
the
standards
that
epa
adopts
are
through
purchase
restrictions
or
purchasing
restrictions.
they're
not
production
mandates.
it's
my
understanding
and
i'm
informed
that
the
epa
has
never
implemented
the
clean
air
act
with
respect
to
production
mandates.
they
say
what
can
be
sold
or
what
can
be
purchased.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
is
not...
we...
we
are
not
contending,
justice
o'connor...
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
local
agencies,
san
francisco
or
los
angeles,
can
put
for
their
own
vehicles
anything
they
want.
this
district...
i...
the...
the...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
for
its
own
purchases.
if
it...
i
don't
know
whether
it
does
or
not.
this
is
a
quality
control
district.
i
don't
know
how
many
vehicles
they
have.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
don't
think
that
it
has
the
authority
to
require
other
governmental
agencies
based
upon
emission
standards
to
do
something.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
it's...
and...
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
requirement
by
particular
agencies
to
pick
out
different
types
of
motor
vehicles
that
may
or
may
not
be
sold.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
for
their
own...
for
their
own
purchases,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
agree
with
the...
with
the
way
that
the
chief
justice
put
it,
that
that's
their
own
purchasing
decisions,
and
it's
a
matter
of
state
law
as
to
whether
they
can...
but
that
is
not
what
this
case
is
about.
this
case
is
about
whether
the
south
coast
district
can
impose
those
standards,
including
federal
government
vehicles,
postal
vehicles,
fbi
vehicles,
private
vehicles
that
go
to
the
airports
and
so
forth.
and
the
justification
that
they
say
is
that
we
can
control
the
sale
of
motor
vehicles
willy-nilly
by...
by
controlling
the
purchase.
by
controlling
the
purchase,
you
control
what
can
be
sold
and
thus
can
what
be
manufactured.
they
are
claiming
an
authority
in
southern
california
that
they...
that
they
claim
the
epa
doesn't
even
have.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
from
the
standpoint
of
the
united
states
government,
we're
not
contending
that
the
state
or
an
individual
can
choose
whatever
vehicle
he
or
she
or
it
wants
to
purchase.
what
we're
contending
is
that
the
whole
scheme
of
the
epa
and
the
clean
air
act
and
the...
and
the
preemption
provisions
prevent
different
agencies
by
using
the...
the
mechanism.
the
entire
argument
that
respondents
advanced
here,
by
using
the
word...
by...
by
prescribing
what
can
be
purchased,
they
can...
they
can
control
what
vehicles
will
exist
and
what
vehicles
will
be
run.
it
isn't
limited.
the
authority
that
they're
claiming
isn't
limited
to
their
own
vehicles.
this
same
authority...
they
would
make
the
same
arguments
if
the
south
coast
district
said
all
persons
or
all
persons
that
have
more
than
one
vehicle
or
all
persons
that
live
in
a
certain
portion
of
southern
california.
the
authority
that
they
claim
by
using
the
word
purchase,
which
is
not
in
the
statute,
is
not
in
the
preemption
provision,
and
is
an
authority
that
the...
the
epa
specifically
uses
to
a
certain
extent
under
section
219...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
a,
i
think
that
is
an
inhibition.
b,
i
think
the
respondents
will
say
that
these...
these
purchasing
requirements
are
imposed
upon
fleet
owners
that...
that
requires
them
to
make
purchases
of
certain
vehicles.
so
i
think
the
premise
of
your
question
is
not
correct.
if
southern
california
or
if
the
state
of
california
wishes
to
impose
fleet
requirements,
there
is
a
mechanism.
it's
a
logical,
consistent,
transparent,
open
mechanism
under...
that
was
thoughtfully
put
out
by
congress.
the
whole
mechanism
is
thoughtfully
calibrated
by
congress
to
allow
the
epa
to
make
judgments.
does
this
make
sense
from
a
national
standpoint?
will
this
make
sense
from
other
states'
standpoints?
is
it...
will
it
impose
a
dislocation
on
the
marketplace
for
motor
vehicles?
the
twin
objectives
of
the
clean
air
act
are,
one,
to
produce
cleaner
air,
but
two,
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
does
not
disrupt
the
national
economy
and
the
marketing
of
motor
vehicles,
which
is
an
important
part
of
the
economy
of
this
nation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
to
the
extent
that...
yes.
i'm...
because
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
state
law
question
that
the
chief
justice
alluded
to.
assuming
that
the
state
of
california
was
one
and
the
same
and
decided
that
it
owned
or
had
the
authority
under
state
law
to
purchase
those
vehicles,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
