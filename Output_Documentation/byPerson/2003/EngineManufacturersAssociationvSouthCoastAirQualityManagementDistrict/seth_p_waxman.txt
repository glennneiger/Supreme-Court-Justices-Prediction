mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
section
209(a)
of
the
clean
air
act,
which
is
reproduced
at
page
36a
of
our
brief,
preempts
very
modest
fleet
purchase
rules
which
apply
only
to
vehicles
that
are
already
commercially
available,
that
is,
that
cannot
have
an
effect
on
manufacture...
cannot
require
manufacturers
to
produce
or
sell
anything,
and
which
were
adopted
by
a
unique
airshed
in
which
90
percent
of
all
toxic
air
pollution
derives
from
motor
vehicles.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no
because
the
text
and
the
context
of
the
clean
air
act,
title
ii
of
the
clean
air
act
that
deals
with
motor
vehicles,
show
that
congress
intended
the
word
standard
in
section
209
to
be
used
in
the
same
way
that
it
is
used
in
section
202
and,
indeed,
throughout
the
entirety
of
title
ii...
title
ii.
it's
used
100
times,
i'm
told
by
an
amicus,
in
section
202
alone,
and
every
single
time
that
it
is
used
there,
it
is
used
to
refer
to
an
obligation
placed
on
manufacturers,
that
the
vehicles
they
produce
and
sell
meet
specified
emissions
characteristics.
no
one
contends
that
that
definition,
the
way
the
word
is
used
in
section
202,
covers
the
rules
in
this
case.
now,
express
preemption...
it
requires
discerning
congress'
intent.
it's
not
an
exercise
in
definitional
possibilities,
this
court
has
reminded
us
many
times.
now,
you
can
read
every
brief
from
our
opponents.
every
different
brief
offers
up
some
other
definition,
and
their
briefs
in
related
cases
have
done
the
same.
and
we've
heard
no
definition
this
morning.
they
look
to
the
dictionary
definition
of
standard
or
criteria
or
test,
and
they're
reproduced
in
their
briefs.
but
they...
they
concede
that
there
is
no
dictionary
definition
that
they
offer
that
coincides
with
the
rule
that
they
seek
because
they
concede
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
cover
incentive
programs
or
tax
programs
even
though,
like
purchase
rules,
they
operate
through
the
market
on
manufacturers
and
not
directly
on
manufacturers.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
a...
a
rule
that...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
a...
one
could...
i
believe
that
a
good
argument
could
be
made
that
that
rule
is
preempted
because
it
conflicts
with
the
overall
purposes
of
the
clean
air
act.
but...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but,
justice
breyer,
please
let
me
finish.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
this
is
a
very
important
point.
the
challenge
here
is
that
these
rules
are
expressly
preempted...
it's
in
the
question
presented
in
the
petitioners'
brief...
expressly
preempted
by
the
first
sentence
of
section
209(a),
and
it
is
expressly
preempted
because
these
are
standards.
and
our
submission
is...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
and...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
here
is
my...
here
is
my
first
effort
at
an
answer.
the
word
standard,
as
it
is
used
in
202
and
in
the
other
provisions
of
title
ii
that
deal
with
different
types
of
standards,
the
standards
with
respect
to
fuel,
standards
with
respect
to
buses,
standards...
standards
in
section
243
that
deal
with
the
federal
clean
fuel
purchase
program,
are
all
obligations
that
are
placed
directly
on
manufacturers.
the
congress
and
the
epa
recognized
when
section
246
was
enacted,
which
is
the
federal
fleet
purchase
program...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
it's...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'll
try...
i'll
be
efficient
and
try
and
answer
two
questions
at
once
then.
first
of
all,
209
doesn't
refer...
doesn't
prohibit
anything
relating
to
a
standard.
it
prohibits
standards
relating
to
motor
vehicle
emissions
just
as
section
202
in
the
very
first
sentence
authorizes
the
federal
government
to
promulgate
standards
applicable
to
the
emission
of
motor
vehicles.
now,
standards,
as
the
word
is
used
in
202
and
throughout
title
ii,
refers
to
emission
characteristics
or
the
obligation
of
manufacturers
to
sell
and
produce
cars.
if
you
look
at
section
202(g)
or
202(h)
and
202(i),
for
example,
those
are
instances
of
subsections
where
it
is
used
not
just
to
refer
to
the
emissions
characteristics
themselves,
but
also
the
obligation
on
manufacturers
and
sellers.
and
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
section
203
of
the
act,
which
is
called
prohibited
acts...
it's
the
enforcement
provisions...
it
is
directed
at
manufacturers
and
sellers.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
the...
the
word
standard...
i'll...
i'll
say
this
one
more
time
and
then
retreat
to
another...
another
argument.
the
word
standard,
as
it
is
used,
for
example,
in
202(g),
is
used
both
to
refer
to
the
emissions
characteristics,
numerical
or
otherwise,
and
an
obligation
placed
on
manufacturers
and
sellers
to
do
something
about
that.
and
the...
let
me...
let
me
give
you
my
second
line
of
argument
here...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
there
are
provisions
in
section
203,
which
is
the
prohibited
acts,
that
it...
it
is
imposed
on
the
people
who
make
cars
and
requires
them
or
limits
them
in
what
those
people
can
make.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it...
it
is...
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
provision
in
section
203
of
the
act,
the
prohibited
acts,
that
deals
with
the
instance
in
which
a
manufacturer,
for
example,
produces
cars
overseas
and
then
tries
to
sell
noncompliant
cars
through
a
distributor
or
some
other
entity.
those
people
are
covered.
but
when
congress
considered
in
1990
its
own
fleet
purchase
rules,
we're
talking
here
about
very
limited
fleet
purchase
rules
that...
talking
about
my
rules...
have
a
commercial
availability
exception.
they
do
not...
they
cannot
be
read
to
require
manufacturers
to
make
anything
they
don't
make
or
sellers
to
sell
anything
they
don't
sell.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
there
may
be...
the...
the
vehicle
has
to
be...
the
rules
make
quite
clear
that
the
vehicles
have
to
be
available
and
able
to
be
used
by
that
user
in
the
locality,
the
fuel...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there...
the
petitioner
does
not
say
it's
very
difficult
to
get,
and
that
footnote
7
on
page
8
of
their
brief
is
truly
the
13th
chime
of
the
clock
in
their
argument.
the...
if
we
had
to
establish
a
factual
record
in
this
case...
and
there
is
none...
i
am
told
by
my
client
that
these
exemptions
are
sought
for
some
of
these
rules
never
because
the
vehicles
are...
are
readily
available,
for
example,
with
respect
to
street
sweepers,
and
on
other
vehicles,
they
are
readily
given.
if
somebody...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
13th
chime
of
the
clock
is...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's
on
page
8,
footnote
7
of
their
reply
brief.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
say
that,
oh,
well,
about
commercial
availability,
it's
just
not
true.
the
district
that
promulgated
these
rules
said
it
only
applies
when
it's
commercially
available.
the
state
that
enacted
a
provision
that
authorized
these
rules
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
saying
it
applies
only
when
it's
commercially
available.
no
one
in
this
case
or
any
other
case
has
ever
argued
that
that
commercial
availability
exemption
doesn't
exist
until
footnote
7
of
their
reply
brief,
and
it
is
simply
wrong.
but
my
point
generally
about
the...
the
meaning
of
the
word
standard
in
the
federal
act,
title
ii,
is
in
1990
congress
enacted
its
own
fleet
purchasing
rules,
and
they
are
codified
in...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
no.
congress
put
into...
amended
the
clean
air
act
to
require
certain
states
that
have
nonattainment
areas
to
include
within
their
state
implementation
plans
either
a
fleet...
a
set
of
fleet
purchase
rules
or
some
alternative
that
they
would
propose
that
would
be
equally
efficacious
in
cleaning
the
air.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is
not
expressly
preempted
by
section
209(a).
it
would
be
subject
to
conflict
preemption
principles,
as
this
court
went
through
in
geier
v.
american
honda,
if
it
could
be
shown
that...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think...
i
think
it
may
well
be
preempted
by...
under
conflict
preemption
principles,
not
express
preemption,
if
it
could
be
shown
that
this
is
really
a
sales
or
production...
this
is
really
an
obligation
that
is
masquerading
as
a
purchase
requirement.
that
would
be
the
analysis...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
to
be
sure...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
because
standards,
as
i
said...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
a
standard
is...
is
a
requirement
that
is
imposed
on
manufacturers
and
that
distinction
is
drawn
throughout
title
ii...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
it's...
i
actually
think
that
209(b)
is
important
proof
for
our
premise
that
section
209(a),
the
word
standard,
has
to
be
read...
it
has
to
be
read
to
be
used
in
the
same
way
as
section
202.
and
clearly
the
way
that...
when
i...
when
we
talk
about
production
mandates,
i...
it's...
it's
actually
the
congress
in
section
249(h)
used
the
word
production
or
sales
mandates.
the
epa
in
its
rules
and
in
its
letter
that
was
submitted
under
a
primary
jurisdiction
referral
to
the
first
circuit
talks
about
production
requirements.
it's
shorthand.
but
i
readily
agree
that
when
209(b)
or
209(a)
or
202
apply...
when
i'm
talking
about
production
mandates,
i'm
talking
about
an
obligation
that's
placed
on
the
manufacturers
about
what
they
produce
and
can
sell.
it's
one
and
the
same.
there
was
a
presumption
that
they
would
try
and
sell
what
they
produced
and
they
would
produce
the
things
that
they
want
to
sell.
the
point
is
that
in...
when
congress
enacted
the
federal
fleet
purchase
program,
it
drew
a...
the
same
distinction
that
is
shot
through
title
ii
between
standards,
which
has
a
very
limited
meaning,
and
requirements.
it's
a
distinction
that
exists
in
section
116
of
the
act,
which
is
on
page
3a
of
our
appendix,
that
preserves
state
authorities.
and
what
congress
said
and
what
the
epa
said
and
what
senator
levin,
who
was
very
ably
representing
the
interests
of
detroit
in
1990,
said
is
these
fleet
purchase
rules,
because
they
are
directed
at
purchasers
may
very
well
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
manufacturers.
they
may
cause
a
race
to
the
top.
but
they
are
different
than
production
standards,
production
mandates,
or
requirements
placed
directly
on
manufacturers.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
are
imposed
on
the
people
who
make
the
cars
when
they
sell
them.
that's
because,
justice
scalia...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
i
wish
that
i
could
have
said
it
that
concisely,
but
that's
the
point
that
i'm
making.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
are...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
my
submission
to
the
court,
your
honor,
is
that
standards,
as
the
term
is
used
throughout
title
ii,
refers
to
the
supply
side
of
motor
vehicles,
the
people
who
make
them
and
the
people
who
sell
them,
and
that
when
congress
wanted
to
make
a
rule
that
dealt
with
purchasers,
which
applies
only
indirectly
against
manufacturers,
it
used
the
word
requirement.
and
that's
because...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
both
209(a)...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
look,
section...
subsection
(d)
of
209
applies
to
vehicles
that
are
not
new.
209(a)
and
209(b)
apply
to
new
vehicles.
what...
209(b)
is
the
presumptive
waiver
for
california
alone
of
the
preemption
provision
in
209(a).
i...
i
don't
want
to
be
pedantic,
but
let's...
we...
we
started
talking
about
1965
and
1967,
and
i
think
it's
tremendously
revealing,
in
terms
of
the
purposes,
what
congress
intended
by
standard
in
209,
to
understand
that
in
1963
congress
enacted
the
first
version
of
the
clean
air
act.
and
it
basically
didn't
authorize
the
federal
government
to
do
anything
other
than
help
states
do
their
part
in
cleaning
up
the
air.
that
didn't
work
very
well,
and
in
1965
congress
enacted
the
provision
that
is
now
202
that
says
we
are
going
to
take
from
the
realm
of
a
traditional
state
authority
this
much
for
the
federal
government.
they
can
and
will
set
standards
applicable
to
motor
vehicle
emissions.
now,
for
the
intervening
2
years,
the
manufacturers
came
to
congress
and
said
this
doesn't
make
things
better,
it
makes
things
worse
because
there
are
a
number
of
states
that
are
promulgating
their
own
mandates
on
how
we
build
engines
and
what
kind
of
equipment
we
have.
and
in
footnote
7
of
our
brief,
we
cite
a
report
by
hew
that
categorizes
what
each
state
was
doing.
it's
a
1976
report.
and
what
they
were
doing
was
not
putting
requirements
on
purchasers.
they
were
saying
to
manufacturers,
if
you
want
to
sell
a
car
in
our
state,
it's
got
to
have
a
whiz-bang
or
a
doodad,
or
it
has
to
meet
the
following
characteristics.
and
the
manufacturers
said,
we
can
only
engineer
and
manufacture
to
one
standard.
so
in
1967,
congress
responded
to
that
by
enacting
what
is
now
section
209,
and
it
compromised.
it
said,
well,
we're
not
going
to
make
you
manufacture
and
engineer
only
to
one
standard.
we're
going
to
make
an
exception
for
california,
which
was
there
before
the
federal
government
was
there.
but
other
than
california,
which
is
subsection
(b),
no
state
can
do
what
it
is
that
the
epa
is
doing
in
section
202.
and
there
are
a
number
of
rules
of
statutory
interpretation,
leaving
aside
the
presumption
against
preemption
in
this
area
of
historic
police...
state
police
power,
that
require
you
to
read
for
an
express
preemption
point,
not
a
general,
broad
conflict
preemption
argument
that
is
not
advanced
here,
that
the
word
standard
is
to
be
read
as
narrowly
as
reasonable
to
preserve
as
much
for
the
states
as
possible.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
it
has
to
be...
it's
only
coherent
if
it
means
that
the
states
are
precluded
from
doing
what
epa
was
mandated
to
do,
which
is
to
tell
manufacturers,
if
you've
got
a
vehicle
over
6,000
pounds,
it
can't
emit
more
than
x,
y,
and
z
grams
per
mile.
what
the
manufacturers
cared
about
was
that
they
not
have
to
make
what
is...
was
subsequently
called
a
third
car.
they
didn't
want
to
have
to
build
different
cars
and
engines
for
different
parts
of
the
country.
and
that's
why
a
rule
that
is
directed
only
at
purchasers
and
has
built
within
it
an
exception
for
anything
that
is
not
commercially
available
or
can't
be
used
for
the
purpose
that
the
user
wants
to
use
it
for
is
not
a
standard.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's
a
difficult
question
that...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
here
to
answer
questions,
and
i
apologize.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
it's...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
breyer,
you
are
not
way
off
base.
[laughter]
you're
slightly
off
base,
but
not
way
off.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
you've
raised...
you've
raised
three
points,
and
i'll
try
and
address
them
in
turn.
they're...
the...
they're...
what
they're
saying
is,
look,
there's
no
big
deal
because...
because
this
airshed,
one
of
33
in
california,
could
take
the
concerns
of
its
citizens...
even
though
it's
mandated
by
the
state
to
promulgate
these
rules,
it
could
go
to
the
bureaucracy
in
sacramento
and
try
and
get
that
bureaucracy
to
include
in
its
list
of
what
it
sends
to
the
centralized
command
and
control
bureaucracy
in
washington
permission
to
enact
rules
that
scientific
studies
show
cause
9,000
premature
deaths
in
the
district
a
year.
now,
it's
true,
but
it
would
not
avail,
that
is,
particulate
emissions
from
motor...
toxic
emissions
from
motor
vehicles
and
diesel
vehicles.
now,
what
about
houston?
houston...
right
now
the
south
coast
is
the
only
extreme
nonattainment
zone
in
the
country,
but
houston
has
been
knocking
at
the
door
for
several
years.
the...
the
waiver
provision
that
they're
referring
to
in
209(b)
would
not
avail
houston.
it
wouldn't
avail
phoenix
which
has
its
own
unique
airshed
problems
with
particulate
emissions.
and
therefore,
our
submission
is
if
it's
a
standard,
yes.
if
you
say
this
is
a
standard,
we
will
go
to
the
state
of
california
and
say
please
sponsor
this
rule
and
please
ask
the
epa
to
give
permission
for
us
to
be
able
to
impose
these
fleet
purchasing
rules.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
believe
so.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
california
health
and
safety
code
that
says
that
the
california
air
resources
board
is
the
relevant
state
agency
for
purposes
of
209(b).
but
more
generally,
if
the...
the
point
here
is
do
you
determine
what
congress'
purpose
is
by
the
effect.
that's
fine.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
if...
if
it
is
a
command
to
manufacturers
with
respect
to
emissions
characteristics
of
the
vehicles
they
make,
it
is
a
standard,
as
that
term
is
used
throughout
title
ii.
if
it
is
directed
at
purchasers
and,
as
senator
levin
and
the
epa
explained
in
1990,
only
affect
manufacturers
and
sellers
through
the
marketplace,
even
though
it
may
have
a
substantial
effect,
it
is
no
different
than
the
many
incentives
and
differential
tax
programs
that
they
say
aren't
covered.
look,
california...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
indeed.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and...
and
these...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
with
respect,
justice
breyer...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
here
you
are
completely
off
base.
[laughter]
the
rules
each...
i'm
not
talking
about
carb's
statewide
standards,
but
the
rules
challenged
here
have
an
exception
for
anytime
somebody
can
show
that
the
vehicle
they
want
is
either
not
commercially
available
or
can't
be
used.
look
at
page
50a
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
rules
are
all
in
the
joint
appendix.
that
happens
to
be
the
rule
that
deals
with
the
one
that
my
book
opened
up
to.
it's
buses.
and
it
says
on
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix
that
this...
an
exception...
an
exemption
to
these
fleet
purchase
rules
where
no
alternative-fuel
engine
and
chassis
configuration
is
available
commercially
or
could
be
used.
and
so
this
is
the
situation
that...
our
submission
is
that
these
things
can't
possibly
have...
impose
a
mandate
on
manufacturers.
and
in
fact,
look...
we...
we
discuss
in
our
brief
a
little
bit
that
california
has
a
program
where
it
provides,
i
think,
a
75
or
90
percent
rebate
to
school
districts
if
they
buy
buses
that
are
fueled
by
alternative-fuel
vehicles.
now,
is
that
going
to
have
an
effect
on
the
kinds
of
buses
that
school
districts
buy?
of
course.
and
is
it
going
to
have
a
big
effect
on
manufacturers?
sure.
and
therefore,
when
we're
talking
about
something
that
is
mandatory,
as
opposed
to
something
that
is
voluntary,
they...
on
page
7
of
their
reply
brief,
they
make
a
distinction
between
voluntary
standards
and
mandatory
standards.
from
the
relevant
perspective,
that
is
the
perspective
of
the
manufacturer,
they
are
the
same,
as
senator
levin
and
the
epa
explained.
they
operate
on
the
manufacturers
through
the
market.
now,
to
be
sure,
there...
you
can
come
up
and
i
think
justice
o'connor
came
up
with
the
extreme
example
of
no
one
in
our
state
can
buy
a
diesel
vehicle.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
one
could
argue
and
one
might
make
a
very
good
argument
that
if
it
is
a
mandate
that's
imposed
on
manufacturers
or
sellers
that
is
masquerading
as
a
purchase
rule,
where
it
really
has
that
effect,
you
may
find
that
substance
will
prevail
over
form,
or
you
may
find...
i
think
it
would
be
more
appropriate...
that
this
simply
conflicts
with
the
fundamental
objective
of
the
clean
air
act
under
the
hines
v.
davidovitz
test.
but
that's
not
the
challenge
that
was
brought
here,
and
that's...
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
conflict
preemption
and
not
express
preemption.
and
that
will...
that
analysis
and
that
mode
of
analysis
will
allow
the
courts
to
deal
with
this
parade
of
horribles
that
has
never
come
true
and
may
never
come
true
if
the
political
branches
don't.
but
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
what
was
going
on
in
1965
or
1967...
this
is
congress'
purpose...
no
one
was
talking
about...
no
manufacturers
were
concerned
about
purchase
rules.
they
were
concerned
about
having
to
engineer
and
manufacture
a
third
vehicle.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
i
think...
no,
no,
no.
with...
with
respect,
this...
this
statute
shut
down
cold,
justice
kennedy,
precisely
what
was
going
on
in
1967.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
your
honor.
