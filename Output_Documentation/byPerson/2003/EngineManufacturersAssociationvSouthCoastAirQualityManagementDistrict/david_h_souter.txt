justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
sale
requirements.
it's
a
purchase
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
your...
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
going
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
although
there
is
an
avenue
for
the
state,
as
it
were,
to
get
where...
where
it
might
want
to
go
on
a...
on
a
fleet
policy
under
246,
the
district
simply
does
not
have
that
avenue
open
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought...
i
thought
this
was
the
case
in...
in
which
part
a
applies
both
to
the
district,
as
in
justice
o'connor's
question,
and
to
non-governmental
entities
so
that
it's
not
that
a
applies
to...
to
one
kind
of
buyer
and
b
to
another.
there's
a...
there's
a
rule
that
applies
to
buyers.
and
justice...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
o'connor's
question
in
effect
says,
if
there
is
a
substantial...
if
there
is
an
application
of
that
rule
that
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases
at
least
would
not
be
preempted,
then
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
facial
challenge?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
applying
salerno.
i'm...
i'm
applying
a
substantial
application
rather
than
a
one-instance
kind
of
rule.
and...
and
your
answer
to
that
was,
well,
we
don't
have
to
challenge
all
rules.
we
could
challenge
a
but
not
b.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
my
response
is
the
rule
that
covers
the
governmental
situation
and
the
private
situation
is
the
same
rule,
and
if
that
rule
has
a
substantial
number
of
constitutional
applications
or...
or
non-preempted
applications,
doesn't
that,
in...
in
effect,
defeat
the
facial
challenge?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
distinction
between
standard
and
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
just
say
they
are
imposed
upon
the
sellers?
and
that's
the
way
they
get
imposed
upon
the
manufacturers.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
that's...
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
waxman,
i
think...
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
i
think
the
effect
that
justice
breyer
is
thinking
about
is
the
effect
of...
of
being
forced
to
manufacture
the
third
car.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
i
thought
your
answer
to
that
was
because
you
don't
have
to
buy
anything
that
is
not
commercially
available,
that
nixes
the
third
car
effect
argument,
and
therefore
there
isn't
preemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
be
conflict
preemption,
not
express
preemption.
