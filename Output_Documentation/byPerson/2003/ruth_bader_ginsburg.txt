justice
ginsburg
before
you
do
that,
can
i
ask
a
practical
question?
how
is
maryland,
if
it
is,
adversely
affected
by
this
pipe
and
the
water
intake?
is
there
any
adverse
impact
on
maryland
or
is
maryland
just
trying
to
say,
we
are
the
sovereign?
so
even
though
our
people
are
not
being
adversely
affected,
you
need
to
get
a
permit
from
us.
is
there
any
adverse
impact
on
maryland
or
its
residents?
justice
ginsburg
why?
yes.
because...
because
there
wasn't
enough
water
for
the
people
in...
in
maryland?
that's...
it...
one
thing
is,
well,
we're
sovereign
and
you...
we
have
to
give
our
permission.
another
is
our
people
are
not
going
to
have
enough
water
if
virginia
does
this.
i
think
you're
saying
maryland
had
no
such
objection.
justice
ginsburg
what
was
wrong
with
the
special
master
saying,
yes,
maryland
has
this
1632
decree.
it
looks...
this
grant.
it
looks
pretty
good.
but
virginia
has
these
other
grants.
and
i
think
that
they're
both
arguable.
so
the
states
sensibly
twice
dealt
with
it.
but
your
argument
seems
to
hang
on
that
1632
document
indisputably
was
it,
and
that
everything
else
flows
from
there.
the
special
master
said,
not
necessarily
so.
they
couldn't
even
resolve
it
in
1785.
they
finally
resolved
it
in
1877,
but
it
wasn't
an
inevitable
truth
that
it
was
1632
rather
than
the
virginia
grants.
justice
ginsburg
but
there
were
other
royal
deeds
too,
different
kings,
but
there
were
royal
decrees
that...
that
virginia
had.
justice
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was...
the
earliest
in
time
was
in,
wasn't
it,
1609
or
something?
the--
justice
ginsburg
well,
isn't
it--
--but
you--
--isn't
it
limiting
in
this
extent?
there
is
something
in
this
fourth
article
of
the
black...
of
the
1877
arbitration
award
that
refers
to
without...
without
impeding
navigation...
that's
been
there
throughout...
or
otherwise
interfering
with
the
proper
use
of
it
by
maryland.
what
would
those
words
suggest
other
than
maryland
can
permit
the
use
to
assure
that
its
proper
use
is
not
interfered
with?
justice
ginsburg
is
that
why
the
special
master
said
gambling,
safety
rules,
health,
tax,
licensing,
all
of
that
is
irrelevant
to
this
case?
