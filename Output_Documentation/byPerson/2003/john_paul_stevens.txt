justice
stevens
mr.
baida,
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
can
i
just
ask
you
a
preliminary
question?
i
made
the
mistake
of
reading
the
master's
report
before
i
read
the
briefs.
there's
an
awful
lot
of
discussion
of
the
entire
river
issue
in
there.
is
that...
you're
no
longer
making
that
point?
justice
stevens
--is
that
reasonableness
in
part
assessed
by
the
fact
that
maryland
is
a
sovereign?
justice
stevens
mr.
baida,
can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
basic
question?
in
your
view
is
there
any
difference
between
the
right
that
virginia
has,
the
riparian
rights
of
virginia,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
riparian
rights
of
maryland's
citizens
who...
who
own
the
property
on
the
maryland
shore
of
the
river?
do...
are
they
equivalent?
or
what
is
the
difference
between
the
riparian
rights
of
the
people
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
river?
justice
stevens
so
that
either...
on
either
side
of
the
river,
a
property
owner
could
stick
a
pipe
in
and
drain
the
river.
justice
stevens
you
say
the
riparian
rights
on
either
side
of
the
river
are
subject
to
the
paramount
authority
of
the
maryland...
the
state
of
maryland
to...
to
govern
what
happens
to
the
water.
justice
stevens
no,
it
hasn't
because
it--
--no,
it
hasn't.
but
it's
all...
it's
all
subject
to
the
fact
that
the
owners
on
both
sides
of
the
river
have
riparian
rights.
right?
justice
stevens
now,
my
question...
justice
kennedy
asked
it
earlier,
and
i'm
not
sure
you
got
an
answer.
who
defines
the
riparian
rights?
i
guess
on
maryland's
side
of
the
river
maryland
can
define
the
riparian
rights.
who
defines
the
riparian
rights
on
the
virginia
side
of
the
river?
do
you
think
maryland
has
the
authority
to
do
that,
or
is
there
a
common
law
that's
binding
on
us
or
some
kind
of
overriding
federal
constitutional
principle
at
stake?
justice
stevens
i
think
the
fair
reading
is
that
everybody
thought
there
would
be
plenty
of
water,
so
we
didn't
have
to
decide
this.
all
we're
worried
about
is
transportation
down
the
river,
and
it's
not...
and
now
we've
got
a...
a
possible
problem
on
what
is
enough
water
to
go
around.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
know
that
the
compact
addresses
the
question
of
who
defines
the
riparian
rights
on
the
virginia
side
of
the
river.
justice
stevens
does
that
mean
that
because
maryland
can
define
the
rights
on
the
maryland
side
of
the
river,
it
may
also
define
them
on
the
virginia
side?
justice
stevens
but
is
it
your
contention
that
that's
what
it
is?
justice
stevens
what
if...
what
if
the
virginia
legislature
passed
a
statute
governing
riparian
rights
on...
all
over
the
state
in
other
bodies
of
water,
not
limited
to
the
potomac?
could
that
statute
govern
the
riparian
rights
of
virginia
property
owners
on
the
potomac?
justice
stevens
does
that
plain
language
tell
us
what
riparian
rights
are?
justice
stevens
but
do
you...
what
about
the
general
right
of
a
riparian
owner
on
a
river
to
withdraw
water?
would
you
say
that
right
includes
the
right
to
withdraw
an
unlimited
quantity
of
water?
justice
stevens
well,
then
who
decides
what
limit
can
be...
can
be
imposed
on
the
riparian
owner's
right
to
withdraw
water?
justice
stevens
but
assume
there
are
no
agreements.
--riparian
question
that's
not
controlled
by
those
documents.
assume
there
are
no
agreements
at
all.
would
maryland
have
the
right
to
say
no
more
than
x
amount
of
water
may
be
withdrawn
by
any
riparian
owner
in
maryland
or
virginia?
justice
stevens
could
you
drain
the
river?
justice
stevens
no,
but
i
mean,
your...
your--
--if
they
did
so
contend,
could
they
enforce
that
contention?
justice
stevens
i'm
just
trying
to...
trying
to...
we
have
an
original
jurisdiction
case
involving
a
fight
between
two
states.
and
assume
nobody
had
made
any
agreements
other
than
those
determining
the
ownership
of
this
river.
would
then
maryland
have
no
right
to...
to
limit
the
amount
that
virginia
could
withdraw?
justice
stevens
--just
what
it's
doing
here.
justice
stevens
now,
well,
let's...
let's
forget
the--
--findings.
i'm
trying
to
put
to--
--assuming
that
the
one--
--one
side
all
the
agreements
and
just
have
a
brand
new
problem.
maryland
or
virginia
are
fighting
about
who
can
control
withdrawals
of
water
from
this
river.
and
is
there
any
principle
that...
that
says
that
someone
other
than
the
owner
of
the
river
can
make
that
decision?
justice
stevens
but
what
if
there's
a...
a
pier
going
out
into
the
river
that's
been
there
for
5
years
and
the
owner
wants
to
modify
it,
wants
to
build
something
more
at
the
end
of
the
pier?
from
whom
would
he
get
authority
to
do
that?
justice
stevens
but
that's...
it's
in
the
state
of
maryland.
justice
stevens
the
end
of
the
pier
i'm
talking
about.
justice
stevens
the
pier
is
not
part
of
virginia,
is
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
pier
is
located
in
the
state
of
maryland.
justice
stevens
then
why
wouldn't
he
have
to
get
the
authority
to
make
the
modification
from
the
state
of
maryland?
i
guess
the...
when
they
enforce
the
gaming
laws
or
whatever
they
are,
the
maryland
police
are
the
ones
that
have
jurisdiction,
aren't
they?
justice
stevens
well,
repairing
the
end
of
a
pier,
is
that
a
riparian
use
or
a
non-riparian?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
as
a
matter
of
sort
of
looking
at
history
and
all,
at
the
time
these
documents
were
negotiated
and
prepared,
i
don't
think
anyone
contemplated
the
possibility
that
a
diversion
of
water
from
the
river
would
be
so
great
that
it
might
lower
the
low-water
mark.
and
is
it
your
view
that...
that
virginia
could
syphon
off
enough
water
to
reduce
the...
move
the
low-water
mark
about,
say,
a
foot,
but
not
obstruct
navigation?
clearly,
they
couldn't
take
that
much
out.
but
could
they
change
the
state...
the
boundary
of
the
state
by
doing
that?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
how
you'd
know
what
the
historic
low-water
mark
was
if
you--
justice
stevens
--we
can
do
that
kind
of
stuff.
[laughter]
you...
you
would
say...
but
assuming...
assume
there
is
a...
a...
now
an
understanding
of
what
the
border
is
and
it's
a
fixed
border.
could
virginia
change
that
by
drawing...
withdrawing
water
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
but
you
do
say
that
even
if
it
might
not
change
the
boundary
of
the
state,
they
could
withdraw
as
much
water
as
they
want
as
long
as
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
transportation
on
the
river.
justice
stevens
well,
generally
riparian
owners
are
own...
have
the...
the
right
to
withdraw
water
subject
to
the
overriding
control
of
the
governmental
body
that
controls
the...
the
lake
or
the
river,
whatever
it
is.
justice
stevens
but
you're
saying
that's
not
true
here.
justice
stevens
but
not
subject
to
the
control
of
the
owner
of
the
river.
