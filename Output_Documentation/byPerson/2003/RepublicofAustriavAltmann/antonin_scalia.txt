justice
antonin
scalia
what...
why
would
it
change
the
legal
consequences?
it...
wouldn't
it
just
change
where
you
can,
where
you
can
sue?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
sovereign
immunity
or
is
it
the
act
of
state
doctrine?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but,
i
mean,
even...
there...
there
are
two
things
that
happen
here.
the
sovereign
can
be
brought
into
court,
but
more
than
that,
the
sovereign
can
be
held
to
account
for
the
act
of
the
sovereign
on
its
own
territory.
the
latter,
it
seems
to
me,
can
be
described
as
substantive
law,
the
former,
just
allowing
the
sovereign
to
come
into
your...
or
allowing
your
court
to
entertain
a
suit
against
the
sovereign
is...
is
just...
just
where
suit
goes.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
outcome
of
the
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i...
i
wish
you
could
tell
me
that
it
did
have
to
do
with
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
because
that
would
be...
that
would
be
a
substantive
change
and
that
should
not
be
retroactive.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
hughes...
in
hughes
there
were...
there
were
other
changes
besides
the...
besides
the
jurisdictional
one.
there...
there
were
defenses
that
were
eliminated.
i
don't
think
hughes
is
a
very
good...
good
case
for
you,
but
verlinden,
it
seems
to
me,
is...
is...
is
closer,
but
we
were
determining
there
whether
it
was
a
substantive
law
or
not
for
a
very
different
purpose,
for
the
existence
of...
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
to...
to
enact
the
statute.
that's
a...
that's
a
bit
different
from
the
purpose
for
which
we're
determining
whether
it's
a
substantive
law
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
none
of
that's
in
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
that's
in
question.
the
only
thing
that's
in
question
is
when
congress
enacted
this,
did
they
intend
it
to
have
the
effect
of...
of...
what
should
i
say...
de-immunizing,
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way,
prior
acts
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're...
we're
not
questioning
the
authority
of
the
executive
or
the
authority
of
the
legislature
or
the
importance
of
this
matter.
essentially,
the
issue
is,
what
did
congress
mean
by
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
just
stick...
stick
with
expectations--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
the
moment.
let's...
before
you
get
off
of
expectations,
i
don't
know
that
we
protect
expectations
of
the
sort
that...
that
you're
talking
about.
let's
assume
that
a
state
which
has
not...
not
previously
allowed
a
tort
action
by...
by
two
out-of-state
people,
between
two
out-of-state
people,
to
be
brought
within
that
state.
let's
assume
they
change
their
law
and
they
say,
you
know,
in
the
future,
you...
you
can
bring
a
tort
action.
do
you
think
that...
that
we
would
say,
you're...
you're
disrupting
people's
expectations
if
you
allow
those
persons
who
are...
who
are
the
parties
to
a
tort
in
another
state
before
this
statute
was
passed
to
sue
in
the
new
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
expectation,
you
know?
i
expected
not
to
be
able
to
be
sued
in
virginia.
as
it
turns
out,
i
can...
i
can
be
sued
in
virginia.
did
that
really
affect
my
action
in...
in
this
case?
i
can't
believe
that
austria
when
it
took
this
action
had
in
mind,
oh,
i...
i
know
that
i...
that
i
can't
be
sued
for
this
in
the
united
states,
i
may
be
sueable
a
lot
of
other
places.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sueable
here,
but
i'm
not
sueable
in
the
united
states.
who
cares?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
them
do
not
involve
the
act
of
state
doctrine
and
you
want
us
to
hold
that...
that...
that
this
would
be
a
retroactive
application
of
this
jurisdictional
statute
no
matter...
no
matter
what
claim
is
made,
whether
it's
an
act
of
state
claim
or
not.
if...
if
you
were
limiting
them
to
act
of
state,
i
could
understand
it,
because
that's
a
substantive...
a
substantive
matter,
but
you
want
us
to
say
no...
no
suits
can
be
brought
that...
out
of
actions
that...
that
arose
before
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
begs...
it
begs
the
question
whether
it
is
retroactive
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
could...
could
i
ask
about
the
act
of
state
doctrine?
i
mean,
even...
why
isn't
that
in
play
here?
i
mean,
even
if
giving...
holding
austria
here
would
not
be
acting
retroactively
insofar
as
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
why
wouldn't
holding
austria
liable
for
an
act
of
state
which
previously
would
not
be
a
basis
for...
for
challenge
in
this
country,
why
wouldn't
that
be
acting
retroactively?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
it
poses
a
problem
or
not,
the
suit
is...
is
resting
upon...
is
challenging
an
act
of
the
state
of...
of
austria
that...
that
occurred
in
austria.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
the
issue
would
be,
should
that
be
given
retroactive
application?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
the
act
of
state
context.
i
mean,
that's
what's
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
verlinden?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
they...
but
we
did
say
that
it
wasn't
just
a
jurisdictional
statute.
that's
what
we
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
any...
any
more
retroactive?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it...
is
it
correct
that...
that
we
would
be
out
of
step
with
all
other
countries
if
we...
if
we
allowed
this
suit
to
proceed?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
i
mean...
i
mean,
have...
have
all
other
countries,
when
they've
changed
to
the
new
modern
notion
of
limited
sovereign
immunity,
have
they
all
declined
to...
to
apply
it
in
a
manner
that
the
government
here
would
call
retroactive?
