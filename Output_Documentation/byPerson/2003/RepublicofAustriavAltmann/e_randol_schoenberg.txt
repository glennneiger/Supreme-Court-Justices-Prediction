mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
there
are
four
independent
grounds
for
affirming
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
first,
as
the
court
has
just
discussed,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
regulates
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction,
not
the
underlying
primary
conduct
of
the
parties.
therefore,
the
act
does
not
operate
retrospectively.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
because
the...
the
operative
event,
the
event
that's
being
regulated
by
a
jurisdictional
statute,
as
the
court
has
said,
is
that
exercise
of
the
court's
power,
regardless
of
when
the
underlying
acts
took
place,
the
court
has
differentiated
between
the
primary
conduct
of
the
parties
and
the
secondary
conduct,
which
is
the
exercise
of
the
court's
power.
for
example,
just
last
term
in
the
dole
food
case,
the
court
found
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
is
not
intended
to
chill
the
conduct
of
the
foreign
state.
rather,
it's
there
to
decide
whether
now
presently
it
would
embarrass
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations,
and
the...
25
years
ago,
over
25
years
ago,
congress
decided
that
cases
such
as
these
should
be
allowed
to
go
forward.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
this
would
be
a
much
different
case
if
the
foreign
government
had
ever
said
that
the
prosecution
of
this
case
would
interfere
with
foreign
relations,
as
it
has
in
all
of
these
other
cases.
but
it
hasn't
in
this
case,
it
hasn't
filed
a
suggestion
of
immunity,
it
hasn't
filed
a
statement
of
interest.
a
matter
of
fact,
it
required
austria
to
withdraw
the
act
of
state
doctrine
defense
when
it
was
asserted
below.
this
case
itself--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--the
concern,
as
i
understand
the
government's
concern,
is
that
in
other
cases
that
are
pending
against
japan
and
mexico,
et
cetera,
there
might
be
foreign
relation
issues.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
there
are
two
responses.
first,
the
amount
of
deference
that
is
given
to
the
government's
litigation
position
under
bowen
v.
georgetown
and
also
ins
v.
st.
cyr.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
that...
that's
correct,
and
that's
why
the
second
issue
is
very
important.
i
believe
it
was
justice
powell
who
said
in
the
first
national
city
bank
case
that...
that
jurisdiction
is
not
the
same
as
justiciability.
and
what
the
government
is
talking
about
is
a
justiciability
question.
does
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
for
example,
prevent
this
case
from
going
forward?
i'll
give
you
another
example,
your
honor.
in...
the
same
district
court
judge
who
handled
our
case
and
granted
jurisdiction
in
our
case,
judge
cooper,
also
was
given
a
class
action
case
asserting
world
war
ii
era
claims
against
austria,
this
is
the
anderman
case.
and
just
last
april,
she
threw
out
that
entire
class
action,
because
the
government
had
come
in
and
filed
a
statement
of
interest
and
asserted
its
interest
in
the...
in
the
case,
and
she
found
very
similar
to
the
court's
holding
in
garamendi
last
term
that
the
political
question
doctrine
was
implicated
when
the
government
comes
in
and
says
that
the
prosecution
of
this
particular
case
will
interfere
with
foreign
relations.
but
i've
never
heard
any...
in
any
other
case
the
government
say
that
a
case
that
does
not
implicate
foreign
relations,
as
this
one
does,
should
be
dismissed
on
jurisdiction
grounds
merely
because
we
have
justiciability
concerns
with
other
cases.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
right.
we're
very--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--we're
very
sensitive
to
the
government's
concern,
the
can
of
worms
argument
here.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
it
is
that
all
of
those
cases
present
much
more
difficult
problems
than
this
one
does
in
terms
of,
for
example,
the
statute
of
limitations.
your
honor,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
designed
to
get
rid
of
old
claims.
in
our
case,
because
of
austria's
post-war
conduct
of
concealment--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--there--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--right.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
there's--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--i
can
think
of
at
least
five
problems
that
cases,
old
cases,
would
have.
one
would
be
statute
of
limitations.
form
non-convenience
may
be
a
problem.
it
wasn't
in
this
case.
the
act
of
state
doctrine
we've
mentioned
is
also
a
serious
problem
in
many
of
these
cases.
you
have
interference
with
treaties,
which
is
also
not
this
case.
and
you
have
interference
with
executive
agreements,
which
is
also
not
this
case.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
yes.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
they
can
file
that.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
considered
by
the--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--if
there
were
a
good
reason
why
austria's
ownership
of
paintings
would
interfere
with
foreign
policy--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--well,
there's
a
certain
amount
of
deference
that
would
have
to
be
given
to--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--i
think
under...
under
this
court's
doctrine
in
foreign
affair
and
policy...
foreign
affairs
policy...
there
is
an
automatic
deference
given
to
the
government's
suggestion
that
a
particular
case
will
interfere
with
foreign
policy,
but
in
most
cases
i
think
it
would
be
quite
clear.
this
case--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--well,
i
believe,
for
example,
in...
in
sabbatino,
the
court
did
not
immediately
accept
the
government's
position
as
to
whether
a
case
should
or
should
not
go
forward
and
said
that
it
was...
now,
i
don't
know
whether
that,
whether
sabbatino,
in
that
part
of
sabbatino,
it
would
still
be
good
law
today.
i
don't
think
that's
been
considered.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
right.
it
was
a
plurality
opinion.
but
there
is
a
suggestion,
it
may
not
be
an
answered
question,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
i
can
point
to
a
case
that
would...
would
talk
about
the
deference,
but
again,
we're
talking
about
not
our
situation,
because
the
government
has
not
filed
any
suggestion
of
immunity
or...
or
statement
of
interest
suggesting
that
this
case
would
interfere
with
foreign
policy.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
well,
we
haven't
addressed
the
act
of
state
because
it
hasn't
been
raised
and
it
was
an
argument
that
was
dropped.
i...
i
can
answer
the
question
though.
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
as
i
understand
it,
is
designed
to
prevent
courts
from
entering
into
situations
where
there
is
no
settled
basis
for
deciding
the
case.
in
other
words,
in
the
cuban
cases
where
there's
a
regime
that
has
a
completely
different
property
system
than
ours,
it
would
be
unwise
for
the
courts
to
venture
into
this
political
dispute
over
whether
communism
or
capitalism
is
the
appropriate
way
to
adjudicate
these
cases.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
treaty,
article
26
of
the
austrian
state
treaty
says
austria
must
return
property
taken
from
jewish
families
during
the
nazi
era.
so
there's
no
dispute
between
the
two
countries
as
to
whether
or
what
type
of
law
would
apply
in
this
case.
and
under
sabbatino,
it's
very
much
qualified
by
the
absence
of
a
treaty
governing
the
rule
of
decision.
so
i...
i
don't
think
this
case
could
ever
pose
an
act
of
state
problem.
other
cases
do
though.
that...
and
that's...
that's
really
the
point.
these
cases
against
mexico,
against
japan,
against
poland
could
potentially
pose
serious
act
of
state
problems.
this
particular
case
doesn't.
we'd
be
happy
to
litigate
it.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
that...
that's
correct.
every
suit
against
a
foreign
sovereign
that's
authorized
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
has
the
potential
of
interfering
with
foreign
relations
to
the
extent
that
it
concerns
the
actual
foreign
country.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
in
the
act
of
state
context.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
well,
i...
i
don't
think--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
a
choice
of
law
doctrine,
as
i
understand
it,
and...
and
so
it,
again,
is
not
something
that
really
operates
retroactively,
i
think.
i
don't
think
to...
to
echo
what
was
said
before
that
any
country
could
have
an
expectation
in
how
the
act
of
state
doctrine
will
apply
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
i'm
sorry?
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
well,
whether
it's
a
public
or
private
act
to
collect
paintings,
i'm
not
sure
is
so
clear.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
i...
well,
yes
and
no.
yes
in
the
sense
that
we
do
have
to
establish
that...
that
this
property
was
taken
in
violation
of
international
law,
and
i
think
that
part
of
the
statute
clearly
expects
that
the
taking
be
adjudicated
according
to
the
state
of
international
law
at
the
time.
so
to
that
degree
i
think
yes.
but
whether...
whether
it's
a
public
or
private
act
i
think
doesn't
determine
the...
the
retroactivity
question.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
i...
i
understood
that
to
be
the
government's
position.
i
don't
know
how
the
government
explains
the
santissima
trinidad
case,
which
is
a
case
concerning
private
property
on
a
ship
where
not
one,
but
several,
sovereigns
claimed
an
ownership
interest,
and
justice
story
said
that
our
courts,
of
course,
have
to
adjudicate
the
ownership
of
that
private
property,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
taken
as
part
of
a
public
act.
in
the
santissima
trinidad,
it's
a
confusing
case,
and
i'm
not
sure,
even
having
read
it
many
times,
how
the
ship
came
to
be
in
its
final
location,
but
as
i
understand
it,
it
went
through
many
different,
many
different
hands.
and
the
question
at
the
end
was,
because
the
sovereigns
were
claiming
the
ship,
which
was
potentially
a
ship
of
war,
does
that
mean
that
the
court
could
not
adjudicate
the
ownership
of
cargo
on
the
ship?
and
justice
story
said
no.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
well,
i
would...
i
would
think
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
which
is
what
we
were
talking
about,
would...
would
be
implicated
even
more
strongly
in
a...
in
a
suit
involving
multiple
sovereigns
than
it
would
with
regard
to
just
an
individual
against
a
sovereign.
and
i...
i...
the
government
makes
the
position
i
think
for
the
first
time
today
that
the
expropriation
clause
sort
of
appeared
from
nowhere,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
case.
the
first
section
of
1605(a)(3)
very
clearly
is
the
santissima
trinidad
case.
that's
the
property
is
inside
the
united
states
in
connection
with
the
commercial
activity.
the
second
clause
i
believe
arises
out
of
the
cuban
expropriation
cases
and
the
government's
experience
in
those
cases,
and
it
was
the
intention
of
the
government
in
1976
when
the
executive
branch
proposed
this
law
and
when
the
congress
enacted
it
to
allow
our
courts
to
adjudicate
these
types
of
claims.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
i--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--i
understand--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--i
understand.
it's,
of
course,
difficult
for
us
to
talk
about
it
because
there
is
no
statement
of
interest
in
this
case,
but--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--right.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
i
believe
if...
if
the
government
were
to
file
a
statement
of
interest
saying
that
the
prosecution
of
this
particular
lawsuit
would
interfere
with
the
foreign
relations
of
the
government,
i
think
a
court
would
be
proper
in
abstaining
from
adjudicating
the
case
under
the
political
question
doctrine,
very
similar
to
this
court's
holding
last
term
in
garamendi,
i
think.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
i
would
say
it
would...
it
would
be
very...
it
would
almost
always
have
to.
i
think...
i
think
the
court
should
still
be
allowed
to
determine
whether...
whether
there
is
really
a
basis
for
the
government's
position.
i...
i
wouldn't
say
that
our
courts
necessarily
have
to
bend
always
to
the
government's
position
with
regard
to
a
statement
of
interest.
i
think
that's
the...
the
import
of
the
first
national
city
bank
case
and...
and...
and
the...
the
sabbatino
case
and
alfred
dunhill
also.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
that's...
that's
absolutely
correct.
we're
talking
today
only
about
the
jurisdiction
question.
there
hasn't
been
a
statement
of
interest
filed
and
there
couldn't
be
a
suggestion
of
immunity.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
verlinden
actually
is
a
great
case
for
us
as
i
realized
in
reviewing
it.
verlinden
is...
is
a
retroactive
application
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
in
that
case
it
was
a
foreign
company
against
a
foreign
state,
something
for
which
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
that
action
arose
in
1975
and
yet
when
it
was
brought
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
several
years
later,
this
court
directed
the
lower
court
to
adjudicate
jurisdiction
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
so
that
case
is
exactly
a...
if...
if
anything
is
retroactive,
that's
a
retroactive
application
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
but
again,
it
goes
back
to
this
court's
statements
in
landgraf
that
jurisdictional
statute
which
confers
or
ousts
jurisdiction
is
not
impermissibly
retroactive
and
that--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--it
absolutely
did
not
discuss
retroactivity.
it
maybe
never
occurred
to
any
of
the
justices
or
the
parties
at
that
time
that
a
jurisdictional
statute
like
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
could
be
in
any
way--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--the...
the
court
said
that
it
was
substantive
in
republic
of
mexico
v.
hoffman
in
1945.
the
court
refers
to
sovereign
immunity
as
substantive
law.
but
i
think
as
this
court
has
said,
whether
you
label
the...
the
law
substantive
or
procedural
really
isn't
the
question.
the
question
is,
on
what
activity
is...
is
the
statute
operating?
and
here
it's
operating
on
the
claim
to
immunity
and
how
that
is
adjudicated
by
our
courts
in
deciding
whether
the
court
has
the
jurisdiction--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--it's
correct,
but
i
think
this
case
presents
a
much
better
case
than
the
two
cases
cited
in
landgraf,
the
andrus
case
and
u.s.
v.
alabama,
although
u.s.
v.
alabama
you
could
distinguish
as
something
seeking
only
injunctive
relief
and
therefore
prospective.
in
andrus,
this
is
a
case
brought
against
the
u.s.
government
after
the
u.s.
government...
or
while
the
case
was
pending,
i
think,
the
statute
is
changed
to
take
away
the
amount
in
controversy
requirement.
so,
in
other
words,
very
clearly
before
the
suit
could
not
proceed,
now
the
statute's
been
changed
without
any
suggestion
of
retroactivity
in
the
enactment.
and
the
court
says...
this
is
1978,
i
think...
it's
of
no
moment
that
this
jurisdictional
statute
has
been
changed
now
to
allow
a
suit
against
in...
in
a
sovereign
entity,
the
united
states.
so
i
think
this
case
presents
actually
a
much
better...
much
better
case,
because
here,
and
these
are
other
points
that
i
wanted
to
raise,
i
believe
the
text
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
demonstrates
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
all
claims
to
immunity,
regardless
of
when
the
acts
took
place,
the
underlying
acts
took
place.
our...
our
third
point--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--well,
the
answer
is,
again,
in
landgraf
that
not
every
statute
which
affects
prior
events
is
impermissibly
retroactive,
and
my
point
was--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--well,
i...
my
view
is
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
is...
is
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
take
away
the
immunity
decision
from
the
state
department
and
place
it
in
the
hands
of
judges,
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
that
henceforth
all
claims
to
immunity
should
be
adjudicated
under
this
procedure,
not
the
old
procedure.
in
other
words,
the
u.s.
government's
position
should--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--i...
i
don't...
i
don't
see...
i
don't
think
that
it
is
with
regard
to
the
text
of
this
statute.
i...
even
though
the
statute
does
refer
to
events
that
could
take
place
prior
to
the
enactment,
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
is
what
i
think
the
analysis
requires
that
we
consider,
is
to
change
the
forum
of
the
adjudication
from
the
old
state
department
procedure
to
the...
to
the
court
procedure
under
these
specific
rules.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
the...
the
immunity
consideration,
yes,
but
i
think
the
statute,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
was
not
intended
to
change
the
rules,
for
example,
with
the
act
of
state
doctrine
or
with
the
statute
of
the
limitations
or
with
any
of
the
other
doctrines
that
might
bar
an
older
claim
from...
from
entering
court.
our
third
point,
this
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on,
but
it's
our
view
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
merely
codified
the
common
law
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
therefore,
it
did
not
substantially
change
the
law.
and
this
is
not
only
my
opinion.
if
one
looks
at
the
state
department
circular
that
was
sent
out
in
1976
to
foreign
states,
it
says,
this
enactment
will
not
substantially
alter
the
rules
for
deciding
sovereign
immunity
questions
in
u.s.
courts.
so
it
was
the
position
of
the
state
department
at
the
time
that
they
proposed
this
legislation
that
it
merely
codified
what
the
state
department
then
considered
to
be
the
rules
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
we
have
an
interesting
situation,
i
think
an
unprecedented
situation,
because
the
common
law
itself
depended
on
the
views
of
the
state
department,
so
we
have
a
little
bit
of
a
reflexive
situation.
the
way
i
look
at
it,
let
us
suppose,
for
example,
that
the...
that
instead
of
enacting
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
they
issued
another
tate
letter,
another
letter
that
merely
said,
henceforth
we
want
the
courts
to
adjudicate
under
this...
under
this
regime.
so
it's
not
a
new
statute,
it's
just
a
suggestion
to
the
courts
on
how
to
decide
cases.
under
this
court's
ruling
with
regard
to
common
law,
non-statutory
law,
of
course
that...
that
approach
would
have
to
be
applied
retroactively,
and
i
don't
think
it's
any
less
retroactive
just
because
the
executive
branch
sent
it
over
to
congress
and
said,
we
want
you
to
pass
the
statute
also.
our
last--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--any
more
retroactive.
our
last...
our
last
point
is
really
the
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
and
that
is,
as
to
these
parties
in
this
case,
there
is
no
impermissibly
retroactive
effect,
because
austria
could
never
have
had
any
expectation
of
immunity
with
regard
to
mrs.
altmann's
claims.
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
well,
it...
it's...
but
it's
not
a
point
about
retroactivity,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--it
would
be
better,
but
that's
not
really
how
the
court's
retroactivity
analysis
has
gone
over
the
last
10
years,
and
that's...
that's
why
i
certainly
favor
some
of
the
earlier
arguments.
i
think
it's
easier
to
decide
the
case
on
those,
rather
than
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
evaluating
the
expectations,
but
if
one
doesn't
decide
in
our
favor
on
all
of
those
other
arguments,
that
the
statute
itself
is
jurisdictional,
that
congress
intended
it
to
apply,
that
there's
really
no
change
in
the
law
because
it's
the
same
as
the
common
law
of
sovereign
immunity,
then
really
under
hughes
one
has
to
look
at
whether,
as
to
the
parties
of
this
case,
there
is
any
retroactive
effect,
and
that...
that's...
that's
what
the
hughes
holding
is.
it's
a
statute
phrased
jurisdictionally,
but
let's
look
at
what
happened
here.
you
have
a
new
plaintiff
with
new
incentives
and
a
defense,
substantive
defense
taken
away.
that's
the
hughes
case.
and
so
it
requires
you
to
look
outside
the
four
corners
of
the
statute
to
look
at
what
was...
what
are
you
comparing
the
statute
to,
when...
when
in
hughes
the
court
said
if
it
determines
whether
a
cause
of
action
can
proceed
and
not
where,
the
where
question,
of
course,
implies
that
you
have
to
look
and
see
if
there
are
other
jurisdictions
where
the
case
could
be
brought.
and
in
this
case,
as
we've
made
very
clear,
austria
could
always
have
been
sued,
at
least
since
it
was
re-established
after
world
war
ii
for
these
acts,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
austria
was
required
by
the
united
states
to
enact
restitution
laws
that
were
designed
to
afford
people
like
mrs.
altmann
relief.
they
have
never
asserted
sovereign
immunity
in
these
claims
in
their
own
courts
and
they
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
by
the
u.s.
government,
and
that
sentiment,
of
course,
is
echoed
in
the
subsequent
treaty
in
1955
and
it's
echoed
in
the
bernstein
letter
in
1948
that
as
to
expropriations,
as
to
property
taken
from
jewish
families
in
violation
of
international
law,
this
country
does
not
recognize
sovereign
immunity
anywhere,
not
in
the
states
where...
where...
that
were
involved,
and
not
in
the
united
states,
and
that...
that's...
that's
our
last
point
and
that's
the
ninth
circuit's
position.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--well,
certainly
not
as
a
matter
of...
of
the
statute.
our...
our...
in
terms
of--
mr.
e.
randol
schoenberg
--right.
i...
i
don't
know
how
all
states
have
done
it.
i
know
that,
for
example,
in
austria
we
cited
the
dralle
case,
which
concerned
a
post-war
communist
expropriation
of
a...
of
a
subsidiary
company
in
czechoslovakia,
and
a
german
company
was
allowed
to
sue
czechoslovakia
in
austria
concerning
the
trademarks
and...
and
the
expropriation,
and
have
an
austrian
court
rule
whether
that
expropriation
violated
international
law.
so
i
would
say
as
to
austria,
the
argument
is,
and
i
think
we
cited
also
in
our
brief
a
statement
by
an
austrian
professor,
seidl-hohenveldern,
who
said
that
the
courts...
there's
nothing
in
international
law
that
prevents
courts
from
adjudicating
the
rights
and
property
taken
in
violation
of
international
law.
thank
you
very
much.
