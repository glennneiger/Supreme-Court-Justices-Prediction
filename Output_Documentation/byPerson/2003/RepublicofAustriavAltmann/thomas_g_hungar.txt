mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
has
always
been
that
sovereign
immunity
bars
u.s.
courts
from
adjudicating
pre-1976
expropriation
claims
against
foreign
sovereigns.
as
this
court
recognized
in
dames
&
moore,
claims
by
nationals
of
one
country
against
the
government
of
another
are
frequently
sources
of
friction
between
the
two
sovereigns.
since
19...
prior
to
1976,
therefore,
and
absent
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
expropriation
claims
against
foreign
sovereigns
have
always
been
addressed
through
diplomatic
negotiations
and
foreign
claims
processes,
and
not
in
u.s.
courts.
and
the
united
states
has
entered
into
numerous
agreements
with
foreign
countries
regarding
such
claims,
always
against
and
with
a
background
understanding
prior
to
1976
that
such
claims
could
not
be
adjudicated
in
u.s.
courts.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
changed
expectations
are
relevant
in,
in
the
general
sense,
not
the
particular...
particularized
expectations
of
a
particular
state,
but
that
it
is
a
general
rule
and
understanding
of
international
laws
set
forth
in
the
vienna
convention
on
treaties
and
elsewhere
that
changes
in
international
law,
including
changes
in
sovereign
immunity
law,
are
not
retroactively
applied.
and
there
are
numerous
examples
of
the
latter
point
cited
in
our
brief
at
footnote
14,
and...
and
it
was
an
absolute
rule
in
1948
and
before.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
sovereign
immunity.
sovereign...
it
was
an
absolute
rule
of
sovereign
immunity--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
that's
what
we're
addressing
here.
this...
the
absolute
doctrine,
the
doctrine
of
absolute
immunity
was
applicable
to
all
claims.
there
is
no...
there
is
not
a
single
instance
of
any
case
or
state
department
determination
prior
to
1952
in
which
a
suit
was
permitted
to
proceed
against
a
foreign
sovereign--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
tate
letter
changed--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--with
respect
to
commercial
activity,
but,
of
course,
this
is
not
a
commercial...
it's
not
even
alleged
the...
within
the
commercial
activity
exception.
we're
not
talking
about
commercial
activity.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
because
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
understandings
with
which
the
united
states
and
these
foreign
governments
operated
under
with
claims
resolution
agreements
with
numerous
countries,
not
merely
arising
out
of
world
war
ii,
but
out
of
communist
government
expropriations
and
numerous
agreements
regarding
these
types
of--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the...
the
case
that...
the
doctrine
of
absolute
sovereign
immunity,
there
were
no...
there
are
no
exceptions.
there
could
not
possibly
have
been
expectation
or
reason
to
believe
that
the
executive
of
this
country
would
deny
immunity
in
an
expropriation
case
because
that
had
never
happened
in
the
history
of
the
absolute
doctrine,
immunity
doctrine,
for
150
years.
no
suit,
again,
no
suit
in
the
united
states
has
been
permitted,
was
permitted
to
proceed
on
any
theory
against
a
foreign
sovereign
in
personam.
it
was...
it
would
be
absolutely
unprecedented
for
such
a
suit
to
have
been
permitted
prior
to
1976,
in
fact,
in
the
expropriation
context.
and
so--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--it's
unclear
whether
a...
a
court
action
could
have
been
brought,
at
least
we're
not
familiar
with
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
whether
a
court
action
could
have
been
brought
in
1948,
under,
for
example,
the
restitution
law
that
austria
passed
in
1947.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
that's
irrelevant
because
it
can't
be...
the
retroactivity
analysis
has
to
be
a
term...
determined
on
a
section-by-section,
or...
or
provision-by-provision
basis.
it
can't
be
a
case-by-case,
country-by-country
rule.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
reciprocity
is
also
an
important
consideration,
your
honor.
if
this
law
were
to
be
applied
retroactively,
it
could
open
the
united
states
to
reciprocal
claims
brought
in
foreign
courts,
which
would
further
complicate
our
foreign
relations.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
prior
to--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
believe
that
the...
as
we
said
in
our
briefs,
and
part
of
the
reason
we're
here
today
is
that
there
are
foreign
policy
concerns
implicated--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i'm
not...
understand.
we
are
here
today
saying
the
united
states
has
an
interest
in
not
having
this
expropriation
exception
applied
retroactively
because
it
would
undermine
the
background
assumption--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
we
don't
perceive
a
meaningful
difference
between
an
amicus
brief
expressing
foreign
policy
concerns,
which
is
what
we
have
filed,
and
a
statement
of
interest
expressing
foreign
policy
concerns.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--justice
breyer--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
several
things.
first
of
all,
it's
not
true
that
we
promised
not
to
express
a
view--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that
has
to
do
with
a
particular
agreement
entered
into
in
2001
and
it
is
certainly
our
position
that
that
agreement
does
not
cover
this
case
and
that
was
the
position
we
took.
but
again,
with
respect
to
the...
we
are
expressing
the
foreign
policy
concerns
that
i've
identified,
which
are
generalizing,
go
through
the
retroactive
application
of
this
statute
generally.
we're
not
talking
just
about
austria
here.
there
are
claims
and
potential
claims
against
countless
foreign
countries,
many
of
whom...
many
of
which
would
involve
claims
that
were
previously
addressed--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
principles
of
retroactivity,
the
presumption
against
retroactivity
require--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--this
is
not
a
sub--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--this
is
not
purely...
no,
your
honor,
this
is
not
purely
jurisdictional.
the
fact
that
a...
if
it's
true
that
a
similar
type
claim
could
have
been
brought
in
austria
at
the
time,
that
cannot
change
the
retroactivity
analysis,
because
otherwise
retroactivity
would
be
determined
country
by
country,
and
that
fact
that...
that
a
state
by...
by
an
exercise
of
grace
has
chosen
to
allow
claims
that
somehow
deprive
it
would
change
the
rules,
which
can't
be--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
have--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--may
i
answer,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the...
we...
there
are
currently
cases
pending
against
countries
such
as
japan
and
poland,
with
which...
which
this
country
previously
entered
into
agreements
which
both
sides
thought
had
resolved
the
issue
entirely,
and
to
now
retroactively
apply
a
substantive
provision
that
this
court
recognized
in
ex
parte
peru
is
a
substantive,
not
merely
jurisdictional,
but
a
substantive
legal
defense,
to
apply
that
retroactively
would
be
to
change
settled
expectations,
change
the
rules,
and
it
should
not
be
done.
