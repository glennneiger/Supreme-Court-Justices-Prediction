justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're...
you're
distinguishing
reliance
and
expectation?
an
expectation
is
relevant
even
though
there
may
be
no
reliance.
is...
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is...
do...
do
you
articulate
that
in
terms
of
the
country's
expectation,
even
though
the
country
may
not
have
relied
upon
that
expectation
when
it
acted?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
drawing
that
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
changed
legal
circumstance
that
i
understand
you're
emphasizing
here
is
that,
at
least
prior
to
1976,
this
particular
possession
of
expropriated
property,
as
well
as
the
expropriation
itself,
would
not
have
been
cognizable
in
the
court
of
any
country
unless
possibly
the
country
itself,
which
as
an
act
of
grace
later,
decided
to...
to
make
its
own
reparations.
but
subject
to
that
section...
that
exception...
it
would
not
be...
would
not
have
been
cognizable
anywhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
doesn't
it
retro...
why...
why
isn't
it
just
as
easy
to
say
that
it
does
operate
retrospectively,
because
the
question
is,
when
should
it
exercise
jurisdiction
for
a
particular
purpose?
and
on
the
one
hand
there's
no
point
in
exercising
jurisdiction
now
if
it's
not
going
to
adjudicate
later,
so
so
far
as
the
court
is
concerned,
presumably
it's
going
to
adjudicate
on
a
substantive
issue.
that
being
the
purpose,
why
can
you...
why
really
does
it
make
sense
to
draw
that
neat
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why...
why
isolate
jurisdiction
when
we
all
know
that
the
purpose
of
exercising
the
jurisdiction
is
to
exercise
it
for
the
purpose
of
adjudicating
a
particular
kind
of
case
and
to
apply
a
particular
substantive
law
to
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
just
said
you're
going
to
embarrass
foreign
relations
whether
the
united
states'
position
with
respect
to
a
consideration
in
interpreting
this
act
is
raised
now
or
whether
it's
raised
after
jurisdiction
is
assumed
and
you
get
to
the
next
stage.
why
not...
why
not
get
into
it
now
and
consider
it
in
interpreting
the...
the
scope
of
the
act,
in
particular
its
retroactivity.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
he...
isn't
the...
the
concern
about
the
applicability
of
that
case
to
this
one
is
precisely
the
reason
you
said.
it
was...
it
was
a
suit
between
sovereigns
and
we're
talking
here
about
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
in
a
suit
by
an
individual,
and
it's
rather
a
stretch
to
take
that
as...
as
the
basis
for
your
law
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
i
take
it
that
in
no
case,
in
no
instance
would
you
concede
the
appropriateness
of...
of
the
statement
of
interest
being
considered
at
the
jurisdictional
as
opposed
to
the
justiciability
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
you
on
that,
i
mean,
isn't
the
objection
to
that
that
the...
that
the
subject
matter
we're
concerned
with
here
is
a
subject
matter
which
is
defined
in
terms
of
property
and
the
history
of
that
property,
and
the
history
of
that
property
as
expropriated
necessarily
raises
the
time
question?
and
if
the
time
is
prior
to
the...
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
we
necessarily,
by
the
definition
of
present
subject
matter,
get
into
an
issue
of
retroactivity.
what...
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
impermissibly
retroactive,
but
it
raises
the
question
about
the
permissibility
of
a
retroactive
application.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
even...
even
that,
with
respect,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
begs
the
question.
the
court
is
going
to
adjudicate.
the
question
is
whether
in
adjudicating
them
it
is
going
to
draw
a
line
based
on...
on...
on
this
temporal
consideration.
that
still
leaves
it
in
the
hands
of
the
court.
but
the
question
is
whether
in
the
hands
of
the
court
retroactivity
ought
to
be
a
basis
for
making
the
jurisdictional
decision.
