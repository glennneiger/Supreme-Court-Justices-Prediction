justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
is
a
case
that
maybe
of
more
interest
to
historians
and
art
connoisseurs
than
to
lawyers.
at
issue
is
the
ownership
of
six
valuable
paintings
by
gustav
klimt,
a
famous
austrian
artist
who
died
in
1918.
the
paintings
now
hang
in
the
austrian
gallery
in
vienna.
the
plaintiff
maria
altmann
was
born
in
austria
in
1916.
she
is
a
jew
who
fled
the
country
after
it
was
annexed
by
nazi
germany
in
1938.
she
ultimately
settled
in
california
where
she
now
resides.
her
aunt
adel
is
the
subject
of
two
of
the
paintings
at
issue.
all
six
of
them
hung
in
her
uncle’s
palatial
home
in
vienna
before
1938.
adel
died
in
1925
leaving
a
will
in
which
she
asked
her
husband
to
bequeath
the
paintings
to
the
austrian
gallery.
until
a
few
years
ago,
the
plaintiff
believed
that
her
uncle
had
carried
out
adel’s
request.
in
1998
however,
an
austrian
journalist
who
had
been
granted
access
to
the
gallery’s
archives
discovered
evidence
that
the
paintings
had
not
been
donated
to
the
gallery
by
their
rightful
owner
but
instead
had
been
seized
by
nazis
during
world
war
ii,
and
thereafter
acquired
by
the
gallery.
plaintiff
claims
ownership
of
the
paintings
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
a
will
that
her
uncle
executed
after
he
fled
from
austria
in
1938.
she
filed
this
action
in
federal
district
court
in
california
asserting
jurisdiction
over
petitioners,
austria
and
the
gallery,
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
or
fsia.
enacted
in
1976,
the
fsia
clarified
foreign
sovereign
immunity
law
replacing
the
often
opaque,
inconsistent,
and
politically
charged
standards
courts
had
been
applying
with
a
comprehensive
set
of
legal
rules
covering
all
claims
of
immunity
and
civil
actions
against
foreign
states
or
their
instrumentalities.
the
rule
plaintiff
invoked
known
as
the
expropriation
exception
precludes
foreign
states
from
asserting
sovereign
immunity
in
most
cases
involving
property
allegedly
taken
in
violation
of
international
law.
petitioner's
moves
to
dismiss
claiming
that
when
their
alleged
wrongdoing
theft
placed,
they
would
have
enjoyed
absolute
immunity
from
suit
in
the
united
states.
because
the
fsia
was
not
enacted
until
almost
30
years
later,
they
argued
that
its
expropriation
exception
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
to
deprive
them
of
their
preexisting
immunity.
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
both
rejected
this
argument
as
well
as
certain
other
defenses
raised
by
the
gallery.
we
granted
certiorari
and
limited
our
review
to
the
sovereign
immunity
issue.
because
the
case
has
not
yet
been
tried,
our
review
of
that
issue
does
not
determine
the
final
outcome
of
the
case.
we
presume
that
most
statutes
have
only
prospective
effect
but
several
provisions
in
the
fsia
persuade
us
that
congress
intended
it
to
apply
in
all
civil
actions
brought
against
foreign
sovereigns
even
though
they
arise
out
of
pre-enactment
conduct.
the
fsia’s
preempt
states
that
the
act
will
apply
“henceforth”
to
all
“claims”
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
the
provisions
relating
the
procedural
matters
such
as
venue,
removal,
execution,
and
attachment
clearly
applied
a
claims
based
on
pre-1976
conduct,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
an
isolated
provision
like
the
expropriation
exception
to
have
purely
prospective
application.
applying
the
fsia
to
all
pending
cases
it
is
consistent
with
the
act’s
two
principal
purposes:
clarifying
the
rules
judges
are
to
apply
in
resolving
claims
of
sovereign
immunity
and
eliminating
political
participation
in
the
resolution
of
those
claims.
those
purposes
would
be
frustrated
if
in
postenactment
cases
but
concerning
preenactment
conduct.
courts
were
to
continue
to
follow
the
ambiguous
non-uniformed
and
politically
charged
standards
that
the
fsia
replaced.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
breyer
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
