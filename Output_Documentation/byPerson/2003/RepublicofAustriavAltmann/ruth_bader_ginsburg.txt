justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that...
well,
first,
i
think
you
recognize
that
this
suit
could
be
brought
inside
austria,
and
then
one
of
the
countries
that
don't
follow
the...
the
absolute
rule.
then
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
scalia
is
right,
it's
a
question
of
where
you
can
sue.
you...
your
argument
is
the
united
states
has
been
self-denying,
but
countries
like
austria
itself
that
don't
follow
that
absolute
rule
could
be
a
proper
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i...
as
i
understand
this
claim,
it's
not
the
original
ex
parte...
expropriation
is
when
austria
isn't
even
a
country,
because
this
happened
in
the
nazi
period,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
was
there
a
second
republic?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
may
i
continue,
because
i
thought
that
this
claim,
whatever
you
say
about
austria's
status
in
the,
at
the
time
of
the
anschluss,
that
it's
not
necessarily
about
the
stealing
of
the
goods,
it's
about
the
retention
of
the
goods.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you
know
that
you've
taken
from
an
expropriator,
that's
all
right
under
international
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
be
true
of...
would
that
be
true
of
austria
itself
if
the
tables
were
turned?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
there
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
it
was
relevant
to
something
that
mr.
cooper
said.
he
said
this
was
a
matter
of
fairness
and
we
want
others
to
be
treated...
treat
others...
treat
others
well
so
that
they
will
treat
us
well.
that
sounded
to
me
like
he
was
speaking
in
reciprocity
terms.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
your...
the
discussion
about
the
statement
of
interest
then
fit
in?
it
seems
to
me
what
you
just
said
is,
they
meant
to
take
it
away
from
the
state
department
and
put
it
in
the
hands
of
the
court.
