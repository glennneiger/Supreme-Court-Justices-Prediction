justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how...
how
does
it
work
if
in
fact
you
treat
the
statute
as
purely
jurisdictional?
you
have
to,
one,
establish
jurisdiction,
they
have
it
under
1330.
you
have
to
have
venue,
they
established
that.
and
then
you
look
to
see
if
it's
wiped
out
by
sovereign
immunity,
and
(a)(3)
says
this
is
a
case
in
which
rights
and
property
taken
in
violation
of
international
law
are
an
issue.
right.
so
suppose
you
said,
yes,
that
is
such
a
case,
even
though
the
expropriation
took
place
in
'48
or
earlier
perhaps.
then
the
state
department
could
come
in
and
say,
well,
you
don't
win
if
you
wanted
to.
you'd
say,
after
all,
there
first
is
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
and
this
was
not
clearly
in
violation
of
international
law
in
1948,
or
you
could
file,
what
is
it
called,
it's
a...
an
information,
or
what
is
it,
it's
a
suggestion
of
something
or
other...
it's
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--statement
of
interest.
and
you
say
it's
the...
there's
a...
there's
a
foreign
policy
interest
here,
and
so
that
way
the
state
department's
in
control,
and
if
it
feels
that
it
would
hurt
foreign
affairs
to
have
the
suit
go
ahead,
it
says
either
act
of
state
if
it's
not
clear
or
a
statement
of
interest,
and
a...
which
is
a
kind
of
political
question,
i
guess.
and
so,
what...
how
does
that,
in
other
words,
where
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
there's
no
real
foreign
policy
concern
here
in
respect
to
the
application
of
this
statute
as
a
purely
jurisdictional
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
and
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
was
wrong
with
what
i
just
said?
you
see,
as
i
was
saying
it...
did
you
follow
it?
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
understand
that
and
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
reasoning.
and
my
thought
was,
i
don't
see
why
it
affects
foreign
affairs.
you
can
explain
why.
i
understand
you
believe
it
does
and
i'm
sure
you're
right,
but
i
just
want
to
know
why,
and
the
reason
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
is
because
it
seems
to
me
you
still,
even
assuming
jurisdiction,
can
come
in
and
say
this
was
an
act
of
state,
this
seizure
in
1948,
or
you
can
file
a
statement
of
interest,
which
i
take
it
is
saying
there's
a
big
foreign
policy
matter
here
and
we're
working
it
out
in
other
forums
and
you
courts
stay
out
of
it.
now...
now
am
i
wrong
about
that?
i'm
sure
you're
going
to
say
i
am
wrong
and
i
want
to
know
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
well,
then
the
correct
result
in
this
case
is
to
say
yes,
this
statute
applies,
it
applies
to
1948
seizures,
because
they
were
in
violation
of
international
law.
now,
the
state
department
files
a
statement
of
interest
saying
to
the
court,
there
is
a
valid
foreign
policy
reason
for
not
going
ahead
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it,
by
the
way,
you
promised
you
wouldn't
in
this
case,
but
nonetheless,
all
right.
so...
so
if...
that
would
be
just
up
to
you,
so
if
you
do
it,
then
the
court
will
not
go
ahead
and
adjudicate
this
case
even
though
there
is
jurisdiction
under
the
fsia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
missing
something,
so
you
explain
it
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry
i
brought
that
up.
take
that
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
me
an
example.
i
only
have
one
question
in
this
case
and
i've
just
said
it
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
the
best
answer
i
can.
so
give
me
an
example
of
an
instance
where
it
would
hurt
the
foreign
affairs
interests
of
the
united
states
if
the
law
said
you
proceed
as
i
outlined.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
jurisdiction
but
you
are
free
to
file
act
of
state
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--statement
of
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
it
if...
what
do
you
reply
to
their,
what
i
take
is
their
argument,
that
if
we
say
there
is
jurisdiction
here,
so
that
this
covers
pre-1952
expropriations,
think
of
all
the
eastern
european
bloc,
what
used
to
be,
millions
of
pieces
of
real
estate,
et
cetera,
and
japan,
peru,
all
over
the
world,
south
america,
there
have
been
expropriations,
and
suddenly
our
court
becomes...
become
places
where
you
litigate
who
owns
property
all
over
the
world,
at
least
if
you
trace
an
interest
to
an
american
citizen,
for
expropriations
that
may
have
taken
under
maximilian
of
mexico.
i
mean,
see...
you
see
that
kind
of
problem
i
think
is
what
they're
trying
to
raise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
statute
of
limitations.
let's
go
on,
let's
list
a
few
other
things,
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
might
be
instances
where
the
statute
hasn't
run
for
all
kinds--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
local
reasons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
what
the
statute
of
limitations
rule
is
in
peru
and
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
they
come
in
and
file
a
letter,
in
your
opinion,
assume
you
have
jurisdiction
to
say,
look,
judge,
we
don't
want
you
to
litigate
this
case,
it
interferes
with
our
foreign
affairs,
period?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
can?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
give
a
good
reason,
they
give
a
good
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what...
what
i'm
looking
for,
i'm
beginning
to
understand
his
answer
better...
i
think
there
should
be
a
way,
not
in
your
case
necessarily,
but
in
general,
for
the
government
to
say,
court,
stay
out
of
this
case,
because
of
the
international
implications.
and
what
i
was
thinking
is
if
we...
if
this
is
jurisdictional,
follow
justice
powell's
distinction,
that
won't
be
a
problem
because
there'll
be
other
ways
for
them
to
do
it.
you're
gradually
closing
those
doors.
one
way
i
had
thought
of
was
act
of
state,
but
you
correctly
point
out
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
does
not
bar
anything
when
the
claim
rests
upon
a
treaty
or
other
unambiguous
agreement,
and
your
quoting
the
'55
treaty
might
not
help
you
because
it's
post-'48,
but
a...
but
1907
might
help
you,
so
you're
there
with
a
treaty.
and
so
they
say,
well,
we
can't
use
that
one,
and
there'll
be
a
lot
of
cases
when
we
can't.
so
then
i
had
mentioned
this
thing
called
a
statement
of
interest,
which
i
was
looking
for
an
explanation
because
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
and
there's
a
third
thing
that
you
mentioned,
which
is
called
a
letter
about
immunity.
well,
that
won't
help
them
because
that's
what
this
statute
is.
see,
so
that
now
we're
back
to
the
statement
of
interest.
now,
can...
what
is
this
thing,
a
statement
of
interest?
can...
in
other
words,
is
the
statement
of
interest
sufficient
to
achieve
the
objective
that
i
was
thinking
was
important,
that
not
necessarily
your
case,
but
in
many
other
cases
there
has
to
be
a
way
for
the
executive
to
stop
the
judge
from
deciding
the
matter
where
it
really
does
interfere
with
foreign
relations.
now,
what's...
do
you
see
where
i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
see
that
that
is
the
thing
that
has
been
floating
in
my
mind--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i'm
trying
to
settle
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
can
explain
to
me
what
a
statement
of
interest
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
whether
a
statement
of
interest
is
a
sufficient
legal
route
to
achieve
the
end
that
i
think
is
necessary
and
that
they're
arguing
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
be
a
pretty
good
nightmare,
wouldn't
it,
if
we
had
to
have
judges
trying
to
work
out
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
country
by
country,
whether
turkey
in
1921
when
it
was
an
enemy,
had
a...
didn't
have
an
expectation
of
being
treated
as
a
sovereign,
but
hungary
in
1962
had
a
different
expectation,
et
cetera.
i
mean,
that...
that...
i
think
their
point
on
that's
a
pretty
good
one,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
is
because
they're
saying
that
unless
you
treat
these
things
as
a
whole,
you
won't
understand
the
problem.
and
even
if
in
your
case
the
country
had
no
expectation,
there
are
so
many
countries
that
did
that...
and
going
into
it
case
by
case
is
so
difficult
that
it
would
better
to
have
an
absolute
rule.
that's
their
arguments.
