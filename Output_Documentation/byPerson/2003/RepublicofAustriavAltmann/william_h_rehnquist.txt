justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
03-13,
the
republic
of
austria
v.
maria
altmann.
mr.
cooper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mccoy...
rather,
mr.
cooper.
mr.
hungar,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wind
it
up.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
schoenberg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why...
why
should
we
look
further?
if
the
government
says
that,
i
mean,
isn't
that
conclusive
in
a
case
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
those
are
not
cases
involving
foreign
relations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
for
a
court
to
judge
rather
than
the
executive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no,
but
you're
saying
that
the
executive
could
say
and
have...
give
a
good
reason,
and
the
court
could
say,
no,
we
don't...
we
don't
approve
of
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
case
is
it
that
says
that
the
court
should
decide
rather
than
the
executive
in
case
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it...
we...
it
wasn't
the
court
opinion,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
wouldn't
have
to,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that...
that
has
a
bearing
on
the
landgraf
exception
too.
if
a
statute
is
more
than
jurisdictional,
you
know,
it
isn't
so
easily
disposed
of
under
landgraf.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schoenberg.
mr.
cooper,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cooper.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
03-13,
the
republic
of
austria
versus
altmann
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
