justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in...
in
our
domestic
jurisprudence,
we
are
cautious
about
retroactivity
because
it
destroys
subtle
expectations.
is
that
same
rationale
applicable
when
we're
talking
about
foreign
sovereign
immunity,
or
are
there
other
considerations
such
as
the
dignity
or...
of
the
foreign
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
why--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
leads
to
my...
my
next
question.
if
we're
talking
about
expectations,
my
understanding...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
is
that
in
1948
austria
was...
and
all
countries...
were
on
notice
that
immunity
would
be
judged
later
on
by
acts
of
the
executive,
or
in
this
case,
by
an
act
of
congress.
wasn't
the
expectation
here
that
there
would
be
a
later
determination
of
whether
there
was
immunity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
still
whether
or
not
there
would
be
immunity,
austria
and
all
other
countries
knew,
would
be
a
later
determination,
so
that
the
expectation
they
had
was
to
that
extent
necessarily,
it
seems
to
me,
diminished--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
qualified.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's...
so
there
are
additional
factors
other
than
expect.
what
are
the
additional
factors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
the
friction
that's
feared
in
part
based
on
changed
expectations,
or
is
that
just
irrelevant
to
the
analysis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
that
retroactivity...
retroactivity
causes
more
friction?
because--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
i
thought
part
of
the
baseline
of
immunity
law
was
that
other...
foreign
countries
such
as
austria
knew
that
from
time
to
time
we
would
confer
immunity
or
not
confer
immunity
depending
on
the
decision
of
the
executive.
so
i
don't
see
how
wealth...
how
settled
this
expectation
or
this
other
reliance
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
it
just
told
us
that
it
would
be
an
interference
three
minutes
ago.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
the
public
acts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
public
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
it's
a
public
act.
does
it
have
an
expectation
that...
that
that
will
be
adjudicated
under
the
then-prevailing
norms?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we're
told
that
at
least
in
this
country
such
acts
were
never
adjudicated
in
foreign
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did...
verlinden
didn't
expressly
discuss
the
right
to
retroactivity?
