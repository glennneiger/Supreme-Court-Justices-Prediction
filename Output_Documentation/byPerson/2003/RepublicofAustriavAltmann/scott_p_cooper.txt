mr.
scott
p.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
landgraf
and
its
progeny
provide
the
basis
for
a
decision
in
this
case.
in
enacting
the
fsia,
congress
did
not
direct
that
it
apply
retrospectively
to
events
that
occurred
prior
to
its
enactment.
moreover,
application
of
the
1976
expropriation
exception
to
alleged
conduct
that
occurred
in
and
before
1948
would
change
the
legal
consequences
of
that
conduct,
and
therefore
be
impermissibly
retroactive.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
no,
in
fundamental
terms
it
would
change
the
legal
consequences.
prior
to
1976,
there
was
complete
immunity
in
this
country
for
claims
of
expropriation.
foreign
sovereigns
had
an
expectation
that
they
would
not
be
hailed
into
our
courts
to
answer
for
the
internal
exercise
of
their
sovereign
activities,
and
that
is
the
fundamental
aspect
of--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--the
so-called
tate
letter
changed
the
state
department's
position
with
respect
to
commercial
activities
as
of
1952.
this
conduct
all
preceded
1952
and
concerned
what
has
always
been
recognized
as
essentially
public
acts,
that
is,
acts
of
expropriation.
but
to
finish
the
answer
to
justice
scalia,
the...
the
issue
that
underlies
the
whole
concept
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
at
its
very
basis
is
the
question
of
whether
our
courts,
in
the
case
of
united
states'
jurisdiction,
will
exercise
jurisdiction
to
question
past
judgment
on
the
sovereign
conduct
of
foreign
states
acting
in
their
own...
within
their
own
borders
with
respect
to
property
within
their
own
country
in
this
case.
and
that's
something
that
as
a
matter
of
comity
and
as
a
matter
of
international
concepts
of
orderly
relationships
between
sovereigns
that
we
don't
tolerate.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
the...
this
issue
of
the
adoption
of
the
restrictive
theory
by
any
country
is
really
a
red
herring
here.
the
expropriation
exception
concerns
itself
with
what
has
always
been
recognized
as
a
public
act,
and
that
is
that
the
act
of
expropriation,
something
that
can
only
be
done
by
a
governmental
entity
through
the
exercise
of
its
governmental
authority.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
no,
your
honor.
the
united
states'
position
throughout
world
war
ii
and
thereafter
has
been
that
austria
retained
its
sovereignty,
that
it
was
an
occupied
state
by
the
nazi
regime.
the
united
states
immediately
recognized--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--the
second
republic
was
the
reconstituted
government
of
the
state
of
austria,
but
the
united
states'
position,
and
it
is
the
executive's
position
that
has
binding
authority
with
respect
to
the
sovereign
status,
the
executive's
position
was
that
austria
was
always
a
state.
more
importantly,
your
honor--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--we
don't
believe
that
that's
a
correct
reading
of
section
1603...
1605(a)(3).
1605(a)(3)
concerns
itself
with
the
expropriation
of
property.
the
congress...
i
articulated
the
power
for
the
enactment
of
the
expropriation
exception
as
the
power
to
define
and
punish
violations
of
the
laws
of
nations,
and
it
is
not
even
arguably
the
case
that
a
possession
of
expropriated
property,
especially
as
it's
been
argued
by
the
respondent,
not
necessarily
even
having
been
expropriated
by
the
defendant
country,
is
a
violation
of
international
law.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
it's
all
right.
it's
a
question
of
whether
congress
decided
that
it
was
a
basis
for
an
exception
to
the
long-standing
and
general
rule
of
law
in
this
country,
that
is,
sovereign
immunity.
so
in
other
words,
has...
has
congress
determined
that
one
of
the
narrow
and
specified
exceptions
to
foreign
sovereign
immunity
is
the
mere
possession
of
property?
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
it's
sovereign
immunity,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
this
court
determined--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--the...
the
active
state
doctrine
is
an
independent
doctrine
that
is
not
before
the
court
today.
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
is
before
the
court
today.
sovereign
immunity,
this
court
decided
in
verlinden,
is
a
matter
of
substantive
federal
law.
this
court
made
that
decision
after
careful
consideration
and
with
specific
reference
to
the
fsia
and
congress'
power
to
enact
it,
and
concluded
that
it
was
more
than
a
jurisdictional
statute.
moreover,
in
the
hughes
case,
this
court
determined
that
merely
articulating
a
statute's
terms
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
does
not
remove
it
from
the
retroactivity
analysis
we
urge
is
the
rule
of
law
that...
that
determines
the
outcome
of
this
case.
quite
the
contrary.
hughes
made
it
clear
that
in
circumstances
very
much
like
these,
where
a
cause
of
action
was
not
previously
allowed,
and
here
the
immunity
kept
a...
an
action
for
expropriation
from
being
adjudicated
in
american
courts
under
those
circumstances.
as
of
1976,
there
was
a
fundamental
change
in
the
law
with
respect
to
foreign
sovereigns.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
your
honor,
in
the...
the
administration
of
cases
against
foreign
sovereigns
has
long
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
being
a...
a
matter
of
great
national
interest.
the
question
of
when
we
decide
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
foreign
sovereigns
is
an
essential
component
of
the
way
this
country
interacts
with
other
countries.
it's
an
area
in
which
the
constitution
conferred
responsibility
on
the
political
branches.
the
executive
exercised
that
responsibility
for
the
vast
portion
of
this
country's
history
and
then
submitted
to
congress
an
act,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
act,
which
congress
then
enacted,
and
created--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--very
narrow
exceptions
to
the
doctrine.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
and
it--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--and
congress
in
this
court
has
clearly
articulated
in...
in
landgraf
and
in
the...
the
several
cases
that
followed
it,
exactly
how
we
determined
what
it
was
that
congress
did
as
it
relates
to
the
retroactive
aspects
of
those
changes
in
law.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
we
think
when
the
issue
of
a
concept
of
basic
fairness
so
close
to
the
root
of
our
understanding
of
what
constitutes
fair
treatment
of
any
individual,
that
no
less
standard--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--no
less
rigorous
standard
than
landgraf
should
apply.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
the
expectation
was
that,
based
on
the
general
concepts
of
international
law
and
general
concepts
of
comity,
which
are
not
just
a
question
of
whim
or
courtesy,
but
rather
a
question
of
fair
treatment
of
one
sovereign
by
another
with
the
expectation
that
the
sovereign
who
is
declining
jurisdiction
would
be
fairly
treated
in
the
courts
of
other
countries.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
the
expect--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--expectations
are
only
one
of
a
number
of
factors
that
the
court
has
referred
to
in
landgraf.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
well,
certainly.
landgraf
quoted
justice
story
in
his
1814
articulation
of
what
was
relevant,
but
the
factors
are
expectations,
changed
circumstances,
and
changed
considerations
for
the
parties.
any
case
that
increases
liability,
for
instance,
for
a
particular
act
is
considered
to
be--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--part
of
common
sense--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--our
concepts
of--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--reliance--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--that
kind
of
particularized
reliance
analysis
has
never
been
a
part
of
this
court's
retroactivity
analysis.
it...
the
court
doesn't
look
for
purposes
of
civil
or
criminal
cases,
can
we
find
evidence
that
the
individual,
when
that
individual
acted,
or
the
party,
when
that
party
acted,
had
in
mind
the
current
state
of
law.
the
question
has
been
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
understanding,
is
the
new
law
a
change
in
the
consequences
for
past
conduct?
and--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--we
are
focused
on
the
changed
legal
consequences,
not
the
subjective
intention
of
the
party
in
any
respect.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
not--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--not
solely.
we
are
not
focused
on
the
expectation
component
of
the
test.
we
are
focused
primarily,
although
i
think
expectations
could
be
a
factor,
we
think
that
the
more
important
aspect
of
the
analysis
is
the
changed
legal
circumstances.
that's...
that's
the
core
of
what
the--
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
--that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
reserve
time.
mr.
scott
p.
cooper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
on
that
last
point,
the
dralle
case,
which
is
one
that
we
address
in
our
reply
brief,
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
czechoslovakia's
expropriation
could
be
second-guessed
in
austria.
quite
the
contrary.
austria
determined
that
the
legality
of
czechoslovakia's
activities
in
their
own...
in
its
own
country
were
not
subject
to
reconsideration
in
austria.
austria
concerned
itself
only
with
whether,
given
its
own
neutrality
as
between
czechoslovakia
and
germany,
whether
austria
could
give
effect
to
an
expropriation
as
an
act
of
war.
and
it
determined
that
it
could
not
with
respect
to
property
located
in
austria.
that
issue
has
nothing
to
do
with
what's
before
the
court
today.
sovereign
immunity
isn't
merely
a
form
selection
rule.
it
confers
on
the
foreign
state
the
right
to
choose
whether
and
where
to
be
sued.
that's
a
substantive
right.
it's
a
right
this
country
has
always
understood
as
a
right
in
a
sovereign.
austria's
choice,
if
it
did
so
choose,
the
circumstances
under
which
it
would
provide
remedies
in
its
own
country,
either
by
statute
or
in
its
own
courts,
doesn't
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
sovereignty
to
which
it
had
been
accorded
in
this
country
throughout
the
current
period
up
to
1976.
so
this
country
has
always
recognized
the
difference
between
a
sovereign's
right
to
create
a
remedy,
and
this
country
has
done
so
in
its
own
instances
with
respect
to
events
that
were
claimed
to
be
the
subject
of
reparations,
and
by
doing
so
it
has
never
suggested
that
it
thought
it
was
subjecting
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
foreign
court
for
individual
claims
to
be
able
to
look
for
more
than
the
statute
of
the
united
states
provided
for.
in
addition,
with
respect
to
the
law
immediately
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
fsia,
i
think
the
suggestion
was
that
somehow
the
united
states
had...
had
eroded
the
expropriation
rule
or
that
congress
thought
that
it
was
adopting
the...
codifying
the
law
of
the
land
with
respect
to
expropriation
in
the
fsia,
and
that
plainly
is
not
true.
the
legislative
history,
and
more
importantly
the
statements
of
the
state
department,
in
particular
the...
the
digest
by
john
boyd
with
respect
to
state
department
decisions
from
1952
to
1976
cited
in
our
brief
make
it
clear
that
the
state
department
considered
this
to
be
a
fundamental
change
in
the
law.
the
conduct
being
regulated
here
is
expropriation
or
at
the
very
least
possession
that
goes
back
to
events
in
1948
alleged
in
the
complaint.
it
is
not
the
mere
question
of
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
here
or,
worse
yet,
this
mere
substitution
of
another
tribunal.
this
is
something
that
congress
focused
on
in
each
of
the
expropriation
exceptions.
it
identified
the
conduct
that
it
thought
the
foreign
sovereign
had
engaged
in
that
justified
one
of
our
narrow
exceptions
to
the
general
concept
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
whether
that
was
an
express
waiver
under
(a)(1),
whether
that
was
the
exercise
of
commercial
conduct
that
any
private
party
could
engage
in
under
(a)(2)
or
the...
or
the
expropriation
of
property
in
violation
of
international
law
in
(a)(3),
congress
identified
the
conduct
that
it
thought
justified
the
lifting
of
the
generally
applicable
foreign
sovereign
immunity
and
decided
that's
the
conduct
we
want
to
regulate.
and
that's
what
we
think
justifies
the
variance
from
our
general
rule
with
respect
to
sovereigns,
and
that
is
a
change
in
the
law
that
requires
application
of
the
retroactivity
analysis
to
treat
those
sovereigns
fairly.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing.
