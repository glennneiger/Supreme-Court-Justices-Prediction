okay.
mr.
smith,
you...
is...
is
that
the...
the...
the
force
of
your
argument,
i
take
it,
is
not
that
this
happens
in
one
electoral
year,
because
there
may
be
all
sorts
of
reasons.
it's
something,
your
argument
is,
it
happens
over
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's...
let's...
let
me
start
with
that
assumption.
let's
assume
that
we
come
up
with
a
rule
in
which
we...
we
come
up
with
a
wait-and-see
rule,
and
we
say,
it's
not
enough
for
you
to
prove
a...
a
violation
to
predict
in
advance.
you've
in
fact
got
to
prove
a
violation
by
looking
back
and
establishing
through
the
course
of
three
or
four
elections
that...
that
this
pattern
is
emerging.
and
let's
assume
we
say,
if
you
can
do
that,
you
win.
my
question,
which
then
goes
to
the
substance
of
what
you're
going
to
win,
and
ultimately
the
substance
of
what
your
claim
must
be
is,
what
is
the
principle
that
the
district
court
must
apply
in
a
case
like
that
to
reform
or...
or
redraw
the
districts?
does
he...
does
he
come
up
with
a
principle
that
says
anything
that
follows
traditional
redistricting
principles,
you
know,
compactness,
et
cetera,
is
okay?
that
won't
necessarily
solve
your
problem.
has
he
got
to
come
up
with
a
scheme
that
says
there's
a
presumption
that
all
districts
have
got
to
be
competitive?
if
he
does
that,
there's
going
to
be
a
clear
break
with
tradition
because
there
are
loads
of
places
where
you
can't
have
competitive
districts.
what
is
the
principle
on
which
he's
going
to
reform
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
two
elections.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
trouble
is,
in
the
race
case,
you
have
a
relatively
simple
objective
in
mind.
and
that
is,
the
relatively
simple
objective
is
that
once
you
identify
the
political
party
of
the
racial
voter,
the
minority
voter,
that
minority
voter
ought
to
have,
in
effect,
the
same
opportunity
as
a
non-minority
voter
of
that
political
party.
here,
we
have
a
different
problem.
what
is
the
force
or
power
that
a
member
of
a
given
political
party
ought
to
have?
it's
not
as
simple
as
the
race
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
the
rest
of
their
predictions?
they
got
the
others
right,
didn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
nobody
has
to
bat
a
thousand,
do
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
do...
we
do
now
know,
which
does
tell
us
something
at
least
about
their
predictive
criterion--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and...
and
it
is
that
it...
it
gets
it
wrong
in
one
time
out
of
19,
was
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
one
instance
out
of
19?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
bad.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
isn't
gerrymandering.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
there's
no
gerrymandering
unless
there's
something
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
to
say
there's
no
such
thing
as
cognizable
political
gerrymandering,
period.
