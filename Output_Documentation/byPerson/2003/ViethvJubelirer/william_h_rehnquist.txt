we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-1580,
richard
vieth,
et
al.
v.
robert
jubelirer.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you...
do
you...
do
you
think
the
lower
courts
then
didn't
follow
bandemer?
i
mean,
bandemer
set
a
very,
very
high
standard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
three
of
us
in
bandemer
thought
the
claim
was
not
justiciable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're...
you're
just
pulling
this...
you're
just
pulling
this
thing
out
of
a
hat,
so
to
speak.
i
mean,
you've
got
phrases
in
the
constitution
that
congress
may
do
it
or
the
states
may
do
it.
you've
got
the
equal
protection
clause,
which
was...
came
into
being,
you
know,
in
1868,
not
in
the
original
constitution.
and
they...
they
just
don't
intimate
anything
like
what
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well...
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
when
you
say,
you
know,
the...
the
constitution
doesn't
ever
use
the
word
democracy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you...
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the...
the...
the
constitution
originally
provided
that
the...
the
standard
for
the
state
vote
would
be
the
standard
for
the
representatives
in
congress.
and
in
other...
it...
it
was
simply
left
up
to
the
states.
and
there
were
property
qualifications
for
many
years,
so
it
didn't
represent
the
people
in
that
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
william...
will...
william
f.
buckley,
jr.,
not...
not...
not
galbraith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
the
experts
on
which
you
rely,
were
they
presented
as
witnesses
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
is
it--
--to...
to
what
extent...
what...
to
what
extent,
mr.
smith,
does
your...
does
your
theory
depend
on
the
registration
of
the
voters?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
point
is
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
you
allow
for
some
discrimination?
i
mean,
that...
that's
the
way
legislatures
go
at
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
smith.
mr.
krill,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
krill.
ms.
delone--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
delone.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
delone,
i...
i
think
our
rules
say
we
frown
on
people
simply
reading
their
arguments.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
delone.
mr.
smith,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith
the
case
is
submitted.
