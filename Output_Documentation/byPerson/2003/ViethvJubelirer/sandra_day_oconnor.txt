i
was
thinking
history
showed
that
was
the
way
to
go.

they
couldn't...
they
can't
reach
a
decision
under
that
bandemer
standard.
it's
impossible.
so
maybe
the
way
to
go
is
to
just
stay
hands
off
these
things.

mr.
smith,
over
a
period
of
years,
can
you
identify
any
state
where
your
test
of
partisan
gerrymandering
has
persisted
over
a
period
of
time,
five
years
or
more?
can
you
give
us
examples
of
states
where
it's
persisted
over
a
period
of
years?
justice
sandra

because
in
how
many
states
do
we
have
a
situation
currently
where
both
houses
of
the
legislature
and
the
governor
are
of
one
political
party?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
typically
we
would
expect
that
over
any
period
of
time
that
condition
wouldn't
remain.
you'd...
one
branch
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
other
party
in
time.
certainly
if...
if
you
had
something
like
50
percent
of
the
voters--
