well,
since
we're
talking
about
article
i,
it
also
says
that
the
times,
place,
and
manners
of
holding
elections
for
senators
and
representatives
shall
be
prescribed
in
each
state
by
the
legislature,
but
the
congress
may,
at
any
time,
by
law,
make
or
alter
such
regulations.
that
suggests
to
me
it's
none
of
our
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
to
mention
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
happens
under
a
system
of
presidential
electors
too,
as
we
recently
saw.
is
that
unconstitutional
also?
justice
antonin
scalia
race
does
not
change.
you...
you
are
the
race
you
are,
and
you're
not
going
to
change
it
next
year.
political
party
doesn't
work
that
way.
how
do...
how...
how...
how
do
you
decide
what,
you
know,
what...
what
is
the
republican
vote?
is
it
just
registered
republicans--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
is
everybody
that's
registered
a
republican
now
have
to
stay...
maybe
we
should
make
them
stay
registered
republicans
so
that
we
can
have
good
districts,
right?
i
mean,
it...
it...
i
just
don't
understand
how
you
run
this
scheme.
you
cannot
really
tell
until
after
the
election
is
done
how
many
republicans
and
how
many
democrats
there
are
in
each
district.
justice
antonin
scalia
are...
are
you
going
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--count
on
party
registration?
is
that
the
basis
for
divvying
it
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
last
election.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
particular
election,
they
are
very
hard
to
identify
in
any
particular
election,
which
is
why
the
parties
go
about
selecting
their
candidates
very
carefully.
if
it
didn't
make
any
different,
they'd
pick
any
old
body--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
run
them
and...
and
you'd
get
all
of
the
same
republican
and
the
same
democrat
votes.
that's
not
the
way
the
world
works.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
can
tell
whether
it
discriminates
against
one
political
party,
i
guess
on
the
basis
of...
of...
of
projections
that
may
turn
out
to
be
wrong.
you...
nobody
can
say
for
sure.
but
what...
what
you
can
say,
what
you
can
guess
about,
is
simply
that
it
will
favor
one
party
over
another,
yes.
but...
but
is
it
so
easy
to
tell
that
it
will
unfairly
favor
one
party
over
another?
and
that's
what
you're
arguing
here.
how
unfair
is
unfair?
i
don't
know.
what
is
it,
60/40?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
if
you
have
more
than
two
parties?
i
mean,
like
minnesota,
where
you
have
besides
the
republicans
and
the
democrats
a
very
strong
farmer
labor
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
well,
i...
i'm
sure
they
can.
what...
what...
what
test
do
you
want
them
to
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
each
proportional
representation
for
each
of
the
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
unkind
of
you
to
say
it,
sir,
unkind
of
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
find
something
justiciable
that
you
can't
possibly
devise
a
remedy
for,
does
it?
i
mean,
to
separate
the
question
of...
of
whether
there's
a
violation
from
the
question
of
remedy,
as
though,
you
know,
we'll...
we'll...
we'll
cross
that
bridge
when
we
get
to
it,
doesn't
seem
to
me
very
realistic.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
i
guess
if
there
are
five
different
criteria:
compactness,
past
practice,
or
whatever,
it's
very
much
a
political
call
which
of
the
five
criteria
you
decide
to...
to
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
do
people
always
vote
for
a
particular
candidate
because
he's
a
republican
or...
or...
or
she's
a
democrat?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not.
so
you
can't
tell
from
the
republican
votes
how
many
of
those
are
republican
votes
and
how
many
of
them
are,
you
know,
smith
votes
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
is
this
a...
an
intent
of
a
bare
majority
or
all
of
them?
what...
what...
what
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
get
to
how
you...
how
you
determine
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
whether
it's
based
on
the
majority
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--belling
the
cat.
i
mean,
it's
wonderful
to
use
intent.
how
do
you
find
intent?
that's...
legislative
intent
is
very
hard
to
determine.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
were
also
looking
for
predominant
motive,
not
what
the
exclusive
motive
is,
which
is
the
test
that
justice
stevens
is...
is
proposing.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
02-1580,
vieth
versus
jubelirer.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
population
figures
derived
from
the
2000
census
showed
that
pennsylvania
was
entitled
to
two
fewer
representatives
in
congress.
pennsylvania’s
republican
controlled
general
assembly
drew
up
a
new
district
in
plan.
the
appellants
here
sued
to
enjoin
the
plan’s
implementation
alleging,
among
other
things,
that
it
constituted
a
political
gerrymander
in
violation
of
article
i
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
political
gerrymander
refers
to
according
to
one
definition,
the
practice
of
dividing
a
geographical
area
into
electoral
districts
often
of
highly
irregular
shape
to
give
one
political
party
an
unfair
advantage
by
diluting
the
opposition’s
voting
strength.
consistent
with
that
definition,
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
the
pennsylvania
plans
districts
were
“meandering
and
irregular”
ignored
all
traditional
redistricting
criteria
including
the
preservation
of
local
government
boundaries
solely
for
the
sake
of
partisan’s
advantage.
the
district
court
composed
of
three
judges
dismissed
the
claim.
we
affirm
that
dismissal.
what
i
now
set
forth
is
a
summary
of
the
views
of
a
plurality
of
the
court
consisting
of
the
chief
justice,
justice
o’connor,
justice
thomas,
and
me.
political
gerrymanders
are
not
new.
they
existed
in
colonial
times
and
continued
through
the
framing.
eighteen
years
ago
in
a
case
called
davis
versus
bandemer,
this
court
got
into
the
business
of
policing
misfield
rejecting
the
contention
that
political
gerrymandering
claims
are
non-justiciable,
insusceptible
of
judicial
resolution
because
there
are
no
judicially
discernible
and
manageable
standards
to
apply.
six
justices
in
bandemer
concluded
that
there
were
judicially
discernible
and
manageable
standards
but
could
not
agree
on
what
those
standards
might
be.
four
believed
one
thing,
two
believed
something
else.
the
lower
courts
have
lived
with
that
assurance
of
a
standard
coupled
with
that
inability
to
specify
one
for
the
past
18
years.
abesnt
a
majority
prescribed
standard
they
have
employed
the
standard
enunciated
by
bandemer’s
four
justice
plurality.
its
application
has
almost
invariably
produced
the
same
result
as
would
have
obtained
if
the
question
was
non-justiciable,
that
is
to
say
judicial
intervention
has
been
refused.
18
years
of
considerable
judicial
effort
with
virtually
nothing
to
show
for
it
justify,
we
think,
reconsideration
of
the
question
whether
the
standard
promised
by
bandemer
in
fact
exists.
those
of
us
joining
the
plurality
opinion
conclude
that
it
does
not.
all
of
the
standards
that
have
been
proposed
to
date
are
unmanageable,
indiscernible,
or
both.
the
basic
problem
is
that
some
degree
of
political
motivation
and
effect
in
districting
is
not
unconstitutional.
no
one
contents
that
a
decent
amount
of
political
motivation
and
political
effect
is
unlawful.
so,
it
comes
down
to
determining
how
much
political
motivation
and
effect
is
too
much.
we
find
it
impossible
to
craft
the
standard
that
is
clear
enough
and
enough
rooted
in
constitutional
imperatives
to
render
judicial
entry
into
this
political
field
appropriate.
our
opinion
discusses
all
the
standards
that
have
been
proposed
up
to
now.
in
the
interest
of
time
i
will
summarize
here
only
our
remarks
concerning
the
appellant’s
proposed
standard
since
that
illustrates
the
practical
difficulties
inherent
in
all
the
proposals.
appellants
would
first
require
a
plaintiff
to
show
that
the
map
makers
acted
with
a
predominant
intent
to
achieve
partisan
advantage.
we
have
used
a
predominant
intent
standard
in
our
racial
gerrymandering
cases
under
the
voting
rights
act,
but
its
application
in
that
very
different
context
provides
no
comfort
here.
to
begin
with,
it
has
been
used
there
only
to
assess
challenges
to
particular
districts.
whereas
appellants,
would
apply
it
statewide.
vague
as
a
predominant
motivation
test
might
be
when
used
to
evaluate
single
districts,
it
all
but
evaporates
when
applied
statewide.
does
it
mean,
for
instance,
that
partisan
intent
must
outweigh
all
other
goals
that
the
plan
pursues
contiguity,
compactness,
preservation
of
neighborhood,
etcetera
statewide?
even
within
a
narrower
compasses
of
challenges
to
a
single
district
moreover
applying
a
predominant
intent
test
to
racial
gerrymandering
is
easier
and
less
disruptive
unlike
political
gerrymandering,
a
decent
amount
of
which,
as
i
said,
is
okay,
segregating
voters
on
the
basis
of
race
is
unlawful
and
is
much
more
rarely
encountered.
determining
whether
the
shape
of
a
particular
district
is
so
substantially
affected
by
the
presence
of
a
rare
and
constitutionally
suspect
motive
as
to
invalidated
is
quite
different
from
determining
whether
it
is
so
substantially
affected
by
the
excess
of
an
ordinary
unlawful
motive
as
to
invalidated.
the
second
problem
the
appellant’s
proposed
standard
would
require
a
plaintiff
to
show
one,
that
the
district's
systematically
packed
and
cracked
the
rival
party’s
voters.
those
are
election
campaign
terms
for
compressing
the
voters
of
the
other
party
into
one
district
packing
them
and
cracking
them,
dispersing
them
all
in
order
to
achieve
electoral
advantage.
so,
you
have
to
show
one
that
they
systematically
pack
and
crack,
and
two,
that
the
map
can
thwart
the
plaintiff’s
ability
to
translate
a
majority
of
votes
into
a
majority
of
seats.
again,
our
application
of
somewhat
similar
standards
to
assess
racial
discrimination
claims
under
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
establish
that
this
standard
will
take
root
in
political
soil.
a
person’s
politics
is
rarely
as
readily
discernible
and
never
as
permanently
discernible
as
a
person’s
race.
political
affiliation
is
not
an
immutable
characteristic,
but
may
shift
from
one
election
to
the
next.
and
even
within
a
given
election,
not
all
voters
follow
the
party
line.
we
dare
say
and
hope
that
the
political
party
which
puts
forward
an
utterly
incompetent
candidate
will
lose
even
in
its
registration
stronghold.
these
facts
make
it
impossible
to
assess
the
effects
of
parson
gerrymandering
the
fashion
of
standard
for
evaluating
a
violation
and
finally
to
craft
a
remedy.
appellants
urged
that
their
standard
is
limited
and
thereby
manageable
because
it
would
only
target
those
gerrymanders
that
thwart
the
plaintiff’s
ability
to
translate
a
majority
of
votes
into
a
majority
of
seats.
to
begin
with,
it
is
unclear
how
that
standard
has
any
relevance
to
a
constitutional
violation.
it
rests
upon
the
principle
that
groups
have
a
right
to
proportional
representation,
but
the
constitution
guarantees
equal
protection
of
the
law
to
persons,
not
equal
representation
in
government
to
equivalently
sized
groups
of
which
they
are
innumerable
numbers.
even
assuming
its
relevance,
the
standard
is
unmanageable
because
the
judiciary
lacks
a
reliable
means
to
assess
majority
party
status
in
the
fluid
world
of
political
affiliation.
appellants
would
have
us
look
to
vote
totals
in
statewide
races
to
assess
partisan
support,
but
as
shown
by
the
facts
of
this
very
case,
where
republicans
won
three
and
democrats
won
two
of
the
five-statewide
offices
at
issue,
statewide
races
can
be
utterly
uninformative.
and
what
is
true
at
the
statewide
level
may
not
be
true
at
the
district
level.
we
decline
to
assume
that
the
only
factor
determining
voting
behavior
is
political
affiliation.
bandemer
promised
the
existence
of
a
standard
that
is
both
manageable
and
discernible,
that
is
suggested
by
some
constitutional
requirement.
18
years
have
proven
that
prognostication
false.
we
have
no
reason
to
be
optimistic
as
to
the
emergence
of
a
standard
in
the
future.
pessimism
is
validated
by
today’s
opinions
in
which
the
four
dissenting
justices
produce
three
more
proposed
standards,
all
of
them
different
from
the
two
suggested
in
bandemer,
and
all
of
them
either
unmanageable
or
indiscernible
for
reasons
we
described
in
our
opinion.
we
conclude
that
bandemer
erred
in
holding
that
political
gerrymandering
claims
are
justiciable.
stare
decisis
does
not
require
that
bandemer
be
allowed
to
stand.
stare
decisis
claims
are
at
their
weakest
with
respect
to
a
decision
interpreting
the
constitution
particularly
where
there
has
been
no
reliance
on
that
decision
as
there
could
not
conceivably
had
been
any
reliance
on
bandemer.
we
would
therefor,
overrule
bandemer
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
this
forms
the
fifth
vote
necessary
for
our
disposition
of
affirmance.
he
recognizes
that
there
are
no
existing
manageable
standards
for
measuring
whether
a
political
gerrymander
burdens
the
representational
rights
of
a
party’s
voters.
justice
kennedy
would
however
limit
his
disposition
to
the
case
before
us
recognizing
that
the
outcome
might
be
different
in
a
case
where
a
suitable
standard
could
be
found.
justice
scalia
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
ginsburg;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
i
have
also
filed
a
dissent.
i
shall
make
just
three
brief
points:
the
first,
neither
justice
scalia's
plurality
opinion,
nor
justice
kennedy’s
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
contains
a
single
kind
word
about
political
gerrymandering.
partisan
gerrymandering
like
the
english
rotten
borough
enables
representatives
to
choose
their
constituents
rather
than
vice
versa.
it
is
an
invidious,
undemocratic,
and
unconstitutional
practice.
although
the
plurality
would
rely
on
the
political
process
to
curtail
this
undemocratic
process,
five
members
of
the
court
agree
that
claims
of
this
kind
are
justiciable.
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
fox
to
guard
the
hen
house.
second,
a
reference
to
history,
when
i
was
in
law
school
in
illinois
in
1946,
a
statute
enacted
over
four
decades
earlier
still
define
the
boundaries
of
congressional
districts
in
that
state.
a
suburban
district
with
a
population
of
112000
had
the
same
representatives
as
an
urban
district
with
900000
residents.
it
was
in
a
case
rejecting
a
constitutional
challenge
to
that
undemocratic
allocation
on
justiciability
grounds
that
justice
frankfurter
used
his
famous
metaphor
cautioning
the
judiciary
to
stay
out
of
the
political
picket.
fortunately,
that
metaphor
did
not
carry
the
day
when
our
leader
decisions
in
baker
against
carr
and
reynolds
against
sims
paved
the
path
to
our
one
person
one
vote
jurisprudence.
i
am
confident
that
the
frankfurter
like
reasoning
in
today’s
plurality
opinion
will
eventually
meet
the
same
fate.
finally,
as
a
response
to
the
plurality’s
professed
inability
to
identify
judicially
manageable
standards
to
apply
in
political
gerrymandering
cases,
i
need
only
find
out
that
the
same
standards
that
the
majority
fashioned
to
reject
the
racial
gerrymanders
adapted
to
mitigate
past
injustices
to
minority
voters
could
also
be
applied
in
political
gerrymandering
cases.
after
all
racial
gerrymandering
is
merely
one
species
of
political
gerrymandering.
moreover,
as
the
written
dissent
demonstrates,
other
manageable
standards
are
clearly
available
and
presumably
will
be
applied
in
future
cases.
in
sum,
i
am
confident
that
in
time,
today’s
decision
will
receive
the
same
respectful
treatment
as
justice
frankfurter’s
famous
metaphor.
