mr.
j.
bart
delone
that's
all
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
should
hold
that
political
gerrymandering,
if
it
is
justiciable
at
all,
violates
the
constitution
if
and
only
if
the
disadvantaged
group
has
been
shut
out
of
a
political
process
as
a
whole.
this
is
the
standard
applied
by
the
court's
unconstitutional
vote
dilution
cases,
and
it
is
consistent
with
our
system
of
electing
members
of
congress
from
individual
districts.
in
a
district
system
such
as
ours,
there
are
no
statewide
elections
for
a
slate
of
candidates.
rather,
individual
congressional
elections
are
defined
by
the
unique
characteristics
of
each
race.
that
is
why
statewide
election
results
offer
no
meaningful
standard
for
judging
congressional
outcomes.
it
is
also
why
a
proportionality,
the
idea
that
some
statewide
level
of
support
should
entitle
a
political
party
to
capture
some
specified
number
of
seats,
is
incompatible
with
the
very
idea
of
districting,
and
it
is
why
the
court
has
repeatedly--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--yes,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
and
the
point,
your
honor,
is
that
mr.
smith
and
appellants'
plan
will
lead
the
court
to
proportionality
if...
if
the
court
does
not
consistently
apply
the...
the
vote
dilution
standard
that
has...
has
applied
in
the
past.
and
that
standard
is
that
you
have
to
be
shut
out
of
the
political
process--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--thank
you.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
the...
the
whitcomb
v.
chavis--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--the
shaw
line...
the
shaw
line
cases?
mr.
j.
bart
delone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
because,
your
honor,
in
the
shaw
line
of
cases,
what
they
were
doing
is
they
were
trying
to
isolate
race
from
all
other
factors,
including
politics.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
yes,
your--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--right.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
but,
but
your--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--but,
your
honor,
assuming
that
to
be
correct,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
them
saying,
we
did
it
just
because
they're
democrats.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
well,
i
think
you
have
to...
you
have
to
look
at
what
majority
you're
talking
about,
your
honor.
if...
in
a
districting
system,
you're
talking
about
the
majority
in
a
particular
district
at
a
particular
time.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
but,
your
honor,
if
you're
doing
that,
you're...
you're...
you're
going
into
proportionality.
you're
saying,
if
you're
entitled
to
a...
to
a
sum--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--absolutely
not,
your
honor,
and
that--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
the
idea
of
comparing
any
sort
of
statewide
vote
with
the
districting
votes
that
you
actually
have
is
inconsistent
with--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--again,
your
honor,
assuming
that
that's
correct,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
and
as
far
as
the...
the...
what
level
you
come
to
in
a...
in
a
majority/minority
consignment,
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
way
that
the
bandemer
plurality
did
it,
again,
applying
what
this
court
has
consistently
applied
in
vote...
in
the
vote
dilution
cases,
by
which
i
mean
the
whitcomb
v.
chavis
line
of
cases,
is
to
say,
all
right,
let's
look
at
this
and
see
if
it's
like
a
diagnostic
test,
like
a
threshold.
have
we
got
a
problem
here
where,
over
time,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
much
time,
but
over
a
significant
amount
of
time,
it
looks
like
the
majority
overall
is
being
consigned
in
some
way.
but,
once
you
do
that,
you
must
look
elsewhere,
which
is
what
rogers
says,
whitcomb
says,
all
of
the...
the
vote
dilution
cases
say.
you
can't
ever
look
at
electoral
results
alone.
that's
never
sufficient.
what
you
must
look
to
is
whether
or
not
there's
been
something
else
that
has
caused
a
self-perpetuating
breakdown
in
the
democratic
process,
because
as
soon
as
you...
and--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
permissible,
and
we
think
that
was
the
whole
point
of
what
we
call
the
racial
gerrymandering
line
of
cases,
that
is,
the
shaw
line
of
cases,
where
they
were
saying,
okay,
we
have
a
special
category
here
that
relates
to
race,
and
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
define
the
difference
between
race,
which
is
inherently
suspect,
and
which
requires
special
scrutiny,
and
politics,
which
the
court
repeatedly
said--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--your
honor,
we
think
that--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--we
certainly
think
that
the
court
should
take
this
opportunity
to
find
that...
that...
that
political
gerrymandering
is
non-justiciable.
we
think
that
would
be
the
simplest
and
the
cleanest
way
to
frankly
get
out
of
the
political
thicket.
but...
but
even
if
you
don't
do
that,
what...
what
the
bandemer
plurality
was
doing
was
simply
applying
what
this
court
has...
has
always
applied
with
respect
to
vote
dilution.
and
we
think
it
would
be
kind
of
strange
if
the...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
i
heard
you
ask
that
before,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
no,
no.
yes,
your
honor,
i...
i...
i
think
it
would,
because
justice
powell
thought
in
terms
of
neutral
districting
criteria
and
thought
there
was
some
objective
reality
out
there.
and
frankly,
we
don't
think
there
is
one,
and
if
you
start
down
the
road
of
electoral
results,
we
submit
that--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--with
respect
to
intent,
your
honor,
we...
we
think
it...
it's...
you
certainly
can
assume
that
there
was
political
intent
in
a...
in
a
political
gerrymander--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--it...
it
certainly
could
be
nothing
else,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
well,
i
think
you
can
presume
that
as...
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
42
of
98
in
the
democratic
caucus
voted
for
the
plan.
i
think
you
can
presume
that
they
were
in
some
way--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--no,
i...
i
was
trying
to
address
justice
scalia's
question
about--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--well,
i...
i--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--i...
i
think
you
can
presume
that
whatever
the
voting,
there
was
some
political
motivation,
and
i
think
you
can
presume
that
the
political
motivation
might
be
different
for
different
groups,
different
parties.
and...
and
frankly,
we...
we
don't...
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
the
intent--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--and...
and...
and
i
think
the
intent
would
be...
would
different.
but
it's...
you
can
even
assume
that
it's
political--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
yes,
your
honor,
you
did.
but
in
the...
in
the
racial
gerrymandering
cases,
you
were
looking
for
something
that
was
race-neutral.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
but
again,
your
honor,
your...
your...
the
premise
of
your
question
is
that
there's
something
wrong
with
political
motivation.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that
when
you're...
when
you're
dealing
with
a...
a
political
question
like
districting,
you're...
you're...
i
think
no
political
party
worth
its
salt
is
going
to
be...
not
think
it's...
it's
doing
what's
in
the
public
interest
to
give
itself
as
much
advantage
as
possible.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
but,
your
honor,
in...
in
all
of
these
traditional
districting
criteria,
they're
basically
used
as
tools
by
the
political
parties
to
seek
what
kind
of
political
advantage
they
can.
and
again,
we
submit
that
that
is...
is...
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
you've
been
shut
out
of
the
process,
whether
something
else
is
happening
that
suggests
that
the...
the
process
itself
is
broken.
and
if
you--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--well,
your
honor,
it's...
it's
happened
in
the
past.
it's...
it's...
it's
happened
with
reynolds
and
baker,
and
it's
happened
with--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--no,
it
isn't,
but
it's
the
kind
of
breakdown--
mr.
j.
bart
delone
--yes.
mr.
j.
bart
delone
i...
i
think
what
the
bandemer
plurality
was
trying
to
do
was
to
leave
the
door
slightly
ajar
for
something
that,
frankly,
in
our
political
system
is
too
resilient
to...
to
allow
to
happen,
but
it's
conceivable
that
it
could
happen.
and
frankly,
we
think
that
it's
strange
to
try
and
change
the...
the
standard,
which
is
well
established
in
this
court's
jurisprudence,
just
because
the
political
system
doesn't
allow
it
to
occur.
and
we
think
that
once
you
go
down
the
road
of
electoral
results,
you
go
down
the
road
of
proportionality.
and
the...
the
references
that...
that
appellants'
counsel
keep
making
to
majorities
are
statewide
majorities,
and
that
is
proportionality.
that
is
a
political
judgement,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
has
properly
rejected
that
and
the
court
should
continue
to
apply
the
unconstitutional
vote
dilution
standard
and
that
that...
if...
if
they
find
that
it's
justiciable
at
all,
and
that
the
easiest
and
simplest
thing
for
the
court
to
do
is
to
find
that
political
gerrymandering
is
in
fact
unconstitutional...
excuse
me,
non-justiciable
as
a
matter
of
law.
