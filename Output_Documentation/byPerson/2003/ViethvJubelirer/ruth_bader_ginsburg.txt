justice
ruth

mr....
mr.
smith,
you're...
you're
essentially
asking
how
much
is
too
much.
you
say
you
have
this
decision
that
said
people
have
this
claim
that
they
can
bring,
bandemer.
but
that
was
a
case
where
the
bottom
line
was,
and
you
have
no
claim
on
the
merits.
now,
if
a
judge,
a
district
judge,
in...
in
one
of
these
cases
said,
well,
here's
the
indiana
plan
and
the
court
said
that
that
was
okay,
and
this
one
doesn't
look
any
worse
to
me.
is
there
a
difference
between
the
pennsylvania
plan
and
the...
a
significant
difference
between
those
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
our
precedent,
i
mean,
you
have
to
take
the
whole
of
it,
not
just
half.
the
half
standing
to
sue
you
like,
the
bottom
line,
but
the
indiana
plan,
egregious
as
it
may
look,
is
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
take
into
account
at
all
in...
in
this
picture,
this
is
not
something
that
could
have
been
adopted
by
the
republicans
in
the
state
legislature
alone.
it
took
quite
a
number
of
democratic
votes
to
put
it
through.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that...
is
that
relevant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
example,
what
would
that
be?
