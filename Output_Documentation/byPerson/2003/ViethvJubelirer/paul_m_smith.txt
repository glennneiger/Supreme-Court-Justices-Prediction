mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
held
17
years
ago
in
davis
v.
bandemer
that
a
claim
of
partisan
gerrymandering
is
actionable
under
the
federal
constitution.
but
the
lower
courts
have
since
effectively
overruled
bandemer
by
requiring
factual
showings
of
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
that
are
both
impossible
and,
i
submit,
irrational.
as
a
result,
the
state--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the
standard
that
i
think
was...
the
proper
reading
of
bandemer
does
not
require
that
you
show
that
your
members
of
your
party
have
been
completely
disenfranchised,
to
the
extent
that
african-americans
once
were
in
the
south,
or
that...
that
your
party
has
effectively
been
banned.
the
standard
that
was
applied
here
required
that
you
show
that
you're
being
prevented
from
registering
to
vote,
from
raising
money,
from
campaigning,
from
showing
up
at
the
polls.
those
kinds
of
constitutional
violations
don't
make
sense
as
an
element
of
a
partisan
gerrymandering
claim,
because
they're
not
about
gerrymandering,
and
of
course,
they
never
occur.
so
if
you're
going
to
say
the
claim
is
justiciable,
it
doesn't
make
sense
simultaneously
to
require
people
to
establish
those
kinds
of
independent
violations.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that...
that...
that
history
suggests
that...
that
it...
the
court
should
not
go
that
direction,
because--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
what...
what
we've
seen,
your
honor,
because
of
the...
the
fact
that
the
lower
courts
have
effectively
read...
rendered--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
we've
never
had
a...
an
opportunity
for
the
lower
courts
to
actually
apply
a
standard
that
says
when
does
the
map
become
so
unfair
that
it's
anti-democratic?
what
they
have
done
instead
is
apply
this
shut-out
standard,
which
doesn't
allow
any
real
scrutiny
of
the
map.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
what
we...
what
we
try
to
do
is
articulate
a
standard
which
is
tied
to
the
basic
democratic
values
that
are
at
stake
and
to
the...
and
to
the
article
i
standard
that
says
the
people
should
ultimately
be
deciding
who's
going
to
be
representing
them
in
congress,
not
the
states.
the
one
thing
that's
clear
from
the
constitutional--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
this
court
held
in
wesberry
v.
sanders,
and
has
since
twice
done...
applied
that
again,
both
in
cook
v.
gralike
and
the...
and
in
the
term
limits
case,
that
there
are
judicially
enforceable
limits
on
the
extent
to
which
a
state,
in
exercising
the
procedural
power
to
establish
the
times,
places,
and
manners
of
congressional
elections,
can
create
an
uneven
playing
field
and
attempt
to
try
to
dictate
the
outcome
of
an
election.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
that's...
with...
with
all
respect,
i...
i...
first
of
all,
we
don't
suggest
that
you
should
somehow
look
at
the
departure
from
historical
lines.
that's
not
part
of
our--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--okay.
that's
part
of
the
intent...
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
our...
our
standard
on
effects
is
that...
does
not
suggest
that
politics
should
be
taken
out
of
this
process.
as
this
court
recognized
in
gaffney--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
standard
would
be,
under
our...
under
our
submission,
can
you
demonstrate
that
it
is
absolute...
that
it
is
very
clear
that
you
could
get
more
than
half
the
votes
and
have
no
chance.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but,
you
see,
our
standard
is
precisely
the
opposite.
you
have
to
show
that
it
would...
under
any
voting
pattern,
it
would
happen.
there
is
no
possibility
that
with
more
than
half
the
votes
you
could
get
anywhere
near
half
the
seats.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
we...
we
focus
on
this
50/50
point,
this
majoritarian
standard
for
two
main
reasons.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
one
is
a...
is
a
matter
of
principle,
which
is
to
say,
when
does
consideration
of
politics
go
too
far?
it
goes
too
far
when
we're
no
longer
operating
a
democracy--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--we're
having
a
minority
party
control
the
majority
of
seats.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
but
we...
but
we
have
a...
we
have
a--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--we
have
a
commitment
though
to
the...
to
the
fact
that
the
house
of
representatives
is
supposed
to
mirror
the
people
and
is
supposed
to
be--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--representative
of
the
people.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and
we--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
reason
we
are
focusing
on
the
majority
standard,
the
50/50
standard,
is
in
part
because,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
wesberry
and
it's
recognized
in...
in...
in
cook
and
it's
recognized
in
thornton,
the
states
are
not
supposed
to
be
deciding
for
themselves
who's
going
to
be
representing
the
people.
the
people
are
supposed
to
decide.
the
second
reason
is
that
50/50
you
don't
have
these
problems
of
distortions,
which,
as
an
empirical
matter,
happen
in
a
winner-take-all,
single-member
district
system.
when
you
get
to
60/40,
the
party
that
has
60
percent
of
the
vote
ordinarily
would
expect
to
get
more
than
60
percent
of
the
districts.
that's
why
you
don't...
you
don't
ever
want
to
have
a
rule
of
proportional
representation.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
your
honor.
the
electoral
college
is
not
a
majoritarian
standard
in
the
same
way
that
we...
we
have
here.
because
of
the
great
compromise,
it
includes
two
senators
are
counted,
two
votes
for
the
senators
in
every
state
across
the
board,
so
there...
that...
that
is
the
disparity
between
the
popular
vote
and
the
electoral
college.
but
in
the...
but
the
house
of
representatives
was
supposed
to
be
the
mirror
of
the
people
and
the...
this
court
has
constantly
policed
the
efforts
by
the
states
to
encroach
from
procedure
into
substance,
to
try
to
decide
in
advance,
as
pennsylvania
did
here.
we
would
rather
have
two
out
of
three
of
our
representatives
be
republicans,
even
though
we're
a
50/50
state,
and
regardless
of
how
people
vote,
we're
going
to
determine--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--other
side
of
the
aisle.
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
experts
will
in
all
likelihood
be
involved
as
we...
we
have
an
example
of
the
kind
of
expert
testimony
that
can
be
given
here.
but
this
is
not,
to
use
another
expression,
rocket
science.
experts
testify
in
voting
rights
cases
about
how
districts
will
behave.
they
use
prior
election
returns
plugged
into
those
districts
to
make
estimates
about
how
they
will
behave,
and
it'll
be
the
burden
on
the
plaintiffs
to
establish...
they
have
the
burden
of
proof...
that,
in
fact,
it
is
true
that
if
you
get...
that...
that
the...
this
favored
party,
with
more
than
50
percent
of
the
vote,
will
have
essentially
no
chance
of
getting
half
the
districts.
that
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--we
had
a
trial
on
the
one
person,
one
vote
claim,
your
honor,
after
the
partisan
gerrymandering
claim
was
defeated,
was
dismissed.
and
the...
the
state
tried
to
justify
the
deviation
by
talking
about
neutral
principles
that
governed
this
map,
and
so
we
had
the
opportunity
to
put
a
kind
of
preview
of
our
partisan
gerrymandering
evidence
on--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
this
point--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
the
court
does
have
to
look
at
the
effects
of
the
deviate...
departures
from
traditional
district
criteria--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i...
i
think
it...
the...
certainly
under
our
complaint
and
under
the...
our
conception
of
the
case,
you
don't
look
at
one
district
in
isolation
and
say,
this
district
is
too
ugly
or
too
much
of
a
departure--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that...
that's
not
our
case,
your
honor,
and...
and
the
reason
for
it
is,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
is
going
to
come
in
and
start
imposing,
particularly
districting
criteria,
when
an
ugly-looking
district--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--an
ugly-looking
and
odd--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--only
when...
only
when
it's
talking
about
race
on
either
side
of
the
line,
and...
and
it
could
be
that
the
court
would
ultimately
get
to
the
point
of
saying
a
district
that's
too
ugly
and...
and
divides
democrats
from
republicans
ought
to
be
viewed
in
the
same
way.
but
our
submission
is
more
like
the
racial
vote
dilution
case,
that
not
only
are
there
departures
would
show
partisan
intent,
but
you
have
to
look,
as
the
court
said
in
bandemer,
statewide
and
see
whether,
in
fact,
the...
the...
the
legislature
has
created
a
situation
where
a
republican
votes
counts
twice
as
much
as
a
democratic
vote
in
this
state
because--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
way
you
identify--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
it's
how
people
have
voted
and
how--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
and
it...
it
would
again
be
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
there
are
predictable
voting
patterns,
that
there's
a
large
chunk
of
people
who
are
consistent
democratic
or
republican
supporters
who
are
being
injured
in
their
voting
rights
by
means
of
a...
of
a
deliberate
scheme
by
the
legislature.
now,
the
idea
that
these
people
are
hard
to
identify
is
a
little
hard
to
square
with
a
map,
in
which
you
have
these
incredibly
complicated
peninsulas
going
out
to
find--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--what
the
evidence--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
what
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
in
such
a
case
is
that
there's
a
sufficiently
consistent
pattern
of
voting
in
the
state
that
a
racial...
that
a
political
gerrymander
is
possible
and
it
has
occurred
and
it...
and
that
it
will...
and
that,
in
fact,
in
the
future
there
will
be
an
injury
to
one
class
of
voters
who
have
been
packed
into
a
small
number
of
90
percent
democratic
districts,
while
there's
a
much
larger
number
of
relatively
safe
republican
districts.
now,
you
can
say
that's
not
true
or
we
can't
know
it,
but
we
all
sit
here
knowing...
know
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
registration
might
be
an
indication
of
voting
patterns,
but
our
theory
is...
is
you
look
at
voting
patterns
and
decide
in
advance
of
the
next
election,
will
there
in
fact
be
a...
a
situation
where
it's
impossible
for...
if
the
democrats
got
half
the
votes
or
the
republicans
got
half
the
votes,
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
get
close
to
half
the
seats.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--this
court
has...
has
made
clear
in
a
number
of
cases
that
the
government
has
no
business
discriminating
against
people
based
on
their
partisan
affiliation
or
their
political
viewpoint,
in
contracting,
in
jobs.
and
it
seems
to
us
it
would...
it
should
be
clear
that
at
some
point,
a
level
of
discrimination
in
designing
the
machinery
of
democracy,
the
electoral
process
itself,
a...
a
form
of
discrimination
that's
equivalent
to
saying,
in
two-thirds
of
the
district
we're
going
to
count
all
the
republican
votes
twice,
in
one-third
of
the
districts
we're
going
to
count
all
the
democratic
votes
twice.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
as
this...
this
court
has
made
clear,
both
in
the
race
area
and
the
politics
area,
redistricting
is
a
little
different
from
other
areas.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
demand
purity
and
a
complete
non-consideration
of
these
factors,
but
there
has
to
be
an
outer
boundary.
if
there's
no
outer
boundary,
then--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there's
a--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the
facts
shown
in
the
indiana
case,
in
the
bandemer
case,
were
much
less
severe
than
those
we
alleged
here,
in
terms
of...
here
we
had
allegations
which
were
ultimately
supported
by
expert
testimony
in
the
one
person,
one
vote
trial,
that
they
would
get
a
large
super-majority
of
the
districts
with
only
half
the...
with
half
the
votes
or
less.
and
in...
in
bandemer,
the
facts
as
they
were
presented,
there
was
no
such
expert
analysis.
instead,
they
relied
on
the
results
of
one
election
in
which
one
of
the
bodies
actually
came
out
the
right
way
and
one
of
them
came
out
slightly
the
wrong
way.
they
had
not
supplied
the
court
with
the
same
kind
of
evidence
that
we
would
propose
to
supply,
and...
and
did
not
meet,
at
least
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
the
standard
that
we
propose
here.
it
might
be
that,
in
fact,
if
somebody
looked
at
that
indiana
map,
it
might
have
met
that,
but
nobody
studied
it
in
that
way.
they
were
simply
saying,
look,
it's
really
ugly,
they've
got
these
unfair,
multi-member
districts
in
certain
cities,
and,
in
fact,
the
way
the
vote
came
out
in
the
house,
the
democrats
got
more
than
half
the
votes
and
got
only
43
percent
of
the
seats.
that
i...
that,
i
submit,
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
establish
the
outer
boundary
that
we
would
suggest
you
have
to
meet.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
what--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
that's--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
with...
with
respect,
i...
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
possible
for
somebody
to
look
at
a
map
and
decide
whether
or
not
it
does
or
does
not
unfairly
discriminate
against
one
of
the
political
parties.
courts
draw
maps
themselves
fairly...
fairly
frequently.
they
collect
testimony
from
experts,
the
map
in
pennsylvania
that
was--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
it
gets
to
the
point
where
one
party's
getting
two-thirds
of
the
seats
with
less
than
half
the
votes,
in
a
democracy,
i
submit
that's
the
place
where
it
crosses
the
line.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
let...
let...
i
will...
let
me
directly
answer
that
question
in
a
moment,
but
let
me
just
comment.
i
think
the
idea
of
a
rule
that
says
you
have
to
wait
three
or
four
election
cycles
to...
to
prove
your
case,
it
would
essentially
be...
mean
that
the
claim
is
worthless,
because
you're
going
to
redraw
the
districts
every
10
years,
and
there's
an
enormous
amount
of
irreparable
harm,
as
you
suggest.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
as
you
suggest,
there's
already
irreparable
harm.
once
you've
thrown
out
all
the
incumbents
of
the
disfavored
party,
they
have
new
incumbents
that
have
come
in
now.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
have
a
remedy,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
the
very
first
thing
you'd
want
to
do,
just
as
you
do
in
a
race
case
under
section
ii
is...
is
have
a
map
which
does
not
inherently
pack
and
crack
the
disfavored
group
to
the
point
where
they
don't
have
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
i
think
the
inquiry
would
essentially
be
the
same
though.
they...
the
parties
would
have
to
come
with
the
remedial
map,
the...
presuming
the
legislature
would
have
an
opportunity
to
draw
on
in
the
usual
situation,
in
which
they
could
show
that
it
is
no
longer
the
case
that
there
is
such
packing
and
cracking
of
democrats
that...
that
at
50
percent,
they
would
have
no
chance
of
getting
50
percent
of
the
seats.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
assume
that
the
experts
could
deal
with
that.
in...
in
reality,
in
this
country--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
the...
the...
the
test
we're
talking
about
here
is...
is
if
one
of
the
parties
would
get
to
50
percent,
would
they
have
an
opportunity
to...
to
have
a
majority
of
the
delegation?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it...
it
might
be
relevant
at
trial
if
we
ever
get
to
trial.
our
claim
was
dismissed.
what
we
would
attempt
to
show
at
trial,
and
i
think
we
would
show
at
trial,
is
first
of
all,
not
a
single
democratic
senator
voted
for
it.
there
were
some
democratic
house
members
who
voted
for
it,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
there
are
five
members
of
congress
who
are
democrats
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
who
are
real,
real
happy
with
the
districts
they
got.
and
the
general
assembly,
the
republican
leadership
said,
well,
if
you
guys
want
these
districts,
you
know
what...
you
know
what
the
price
you
have
to
pay
for,
you
need
to
get
us
some
votes.
so
that...
there
are
dynamics
that
take
place,
and
in
any
partisan
gerrymander
there's
going
to
be
some
really
good
districts
for
the
disfavored
party,
just
not
enough,
not...
not
a
fair...
fair
allocation,
not
one
that
would
allow
the
party
to
have
a
majority
control.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i'm
not
sure
that
i...
that
i
have
enough
knowledge
of
political
history
going
back
decades
to
be
able
to
tell
you
whether
that's
the
case
or
not.
it
certainly
will
persist
through
a
decade
as
long
as
the
whole
leadership
of
the
state
doesn't
shift
over
to
the
other
party,
as
long
as
the
party
that
committed
the...
the
crime,
so
to
speak,
maintains
either
the
governorship
or
one
house
of
the
legislature
to
be
able
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there's
quite
a
number
of
states,
including,
as
it
happened
in...
in
this
round,
a
number
of
very
competitive
states,
the...
which
caused
quite
a...
had
quite
a
consequential
impact
on
the
congress,
florida,
michigan,
ohio,
pennsylvania,
and
now
more
recently,
texas
has
come
into
play
and
decided
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--which,
in
order
to
fix
the
problem,
once
it
already
exists,
you
have
to
get
both
houses
and
the
governorship
back
to...
to
pass
a
second
bill.
otherwise,
it's
in
place
for
the
10
years
and
then
what
also
happens
in
most
states
is
the
state
legislatures,
of
course,
gerrymander
themselves
as
well
as
the...
the
congressional
seats,
in
order
to
keep
themselves
in
a
position
where
10...
10
years
hence
they'll
still
be
around
and
in
control
of
the
process
again.
so
there
is
a...
a
fundamental...
fundamentally
anti-democratic
part
of
this,
which
means
in...
in
the
long
run,
you
are...
you
do
have
very
competitive
states
with
extremely
skewed
congressional
delegations.
the...
the
delegation
from
florida
is
18
to
7
in
a
state
that
has
a
robust
two-party
democracy.
now,
that...
that
ultimately
is
not
democracy.
that's
our
submission.
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
start
off
by
saying
i
do
think
that
our
complaint
satisfies
the
standards
of
the
powell
opinion
in...
in
bandemer
that
it
alleges
that
partisan
maximization
was
the
sole
driving
force
behind
this
map.
and
indeed,
we
had
the
opportunity
in
the
district
court,
because
of
the
one
person,
one
vote
problem,
for
the
state
to
come
in
and
try
to
come
up
with
some
justification
for
their
line-drawing
other
than
partisan
maximization,
and
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
in
that
trial
that
the
map
jettisoned
every
criterion
that
this
court
ever
identified
in
karcher,
other
than
partisan
maximization.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
they--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--they...
they...
they
as
well
can
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
people
who
live
in
those
jurisdictions,
your
honor.
and
let
me
just
address
the...
the
question
of
whether
it
makes
sense
to
wait
and
see
how
the
elections
come
out
and
see
whether
there
is,
in
fact,
this
anti-majoritarian
effect
from
the
line-drawing.
one
of
the
real
practical
problems
with
that
is
that
the
lines
themselves
in
a...
in
an
extreme
gerrymander
like
this,
can...
can
effect
the
statewide
aggregate
vote
totals
themselves.
you
saw
that
right
here
where,
in...
with
the
history
of
votes
very
evenly
divided
in
a...
in
a
balanced
map
through
the
'90s,
a
court-drawn
map.
suddenly
with
this
gerrymander
you
had
five
republicans
running
unopposed,
you
had
a
number
of
the
democratic
incumbents
defeated
in
the
primaries
because
they
squared
off--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
i
suppose
that
that
is
in
fact
the
case,
but
you
can't
assume
that
the...
the
vote
totals
under
a
gerrymander
are
independent
of
the
effects
of
that.
first
of
all,
if
they
pair
the
incumbents,
they're
just
not
there
to
run
anymore,
and
there's
a
substantial
distortion
caused
by
the
map.
there
was
some
discussion
by
mr.
krill
of
judicial
races
as
the...
the
test
of...
of
partisan
balance
in
the
map
because
the...
the
supposition
was
that
judges,
when
they
run,
don't
have
any
great
personal
magnetism,
i
guess.
but
he
didn't
mention
the...
the
race
that
was
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
which...
this
was
2003...
where
mr.
bayer
ran
as
a
democrat,
got
52
percent
of
the
votes
statewide,
and
carried
six
out
of
the
19
districts.
that
is
an
indication
of
the
basic
fundamental
packing
and
cracking
that's
in
the
map,
and
is
in
fact
a
form
of
severe
discrimination,
making
some
voters'
votes
count
much
more
forcefully
than
others.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
