let...
let
me
tell
you
my
concern
with...
with
fairness.
if...
if
you
look
at
british
parliamentary
history,
begin
with
walpole
and
go
to
disraeli
and
gladstone
and
pitt
and
churchill,
and
then
if
you
come
to
this
country
and
you
think
about
dirksen
and
cannon
and
webster
and
clay,
i
don't
recall
any
of
them
ever
talking
about
this
issue
from
a
standpoint
of
fairness.
i
don't
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
look
to.
legislate...
there's
just
no
sources
on
which
we
could...
from...
from
which
we
can
draw.
i
would
concede
that
what
happens
here
is
unfair
in
some
common...
common
parlance.
it...
it...
it
looks
pretty
raw.
but
i
don't
recall
legislators
talking
about
what
neutral
standards
ought
to
be.
now,
we
have
in
our
own
juris...
people
talk
about
contiguity,
geographical
compactness,
but
i
just
don't
think
we
have
a...
a
large
source
on
which
to
draw.
we
know
about
numbers,
one...
one
person,
one
vote.
but
beyond
that,
i...
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
at
sea.
justice
anthony

--particular
vice
of...
of
redistricting,
just
on
the
basis
of
politics?
suppose
you
did
it
on
the
basis
of
isolating
or...
or
fracturing
union
votes,
or...
or
the
gay
vote
or
the
environmentalist
vote
or
farm
subsidies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where...
where...
where
does
your...
your...
your
principle
particularly
elect
political
parties?
in...
in...
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
parties
might...
might
well
conclude...
include
some
of
these
groups
that
i've
mentioned.
justice
kennedy
well,
do
you
think...
do
you
think
it's
impossible
to
prove
that
race
was
the
predominant
motive
in
a
particular
redistricting
plan?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
do
you
have
to
be
a
really
tricky,
astute,
very
clever
fact-finder
to
figure
out
what
was
going
on
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
results
you're
urging
on
us
would
require
us
to
supervise
local
entities,
city
councils,
boards
of
supervisors--
