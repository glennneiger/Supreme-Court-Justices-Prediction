justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
then
the
problem
is
that
i
think
i
have
and
others
is,
what
are
these
standards?
now,
you
propose,
one,
look
to
the
mind
of
the
legislature.
we'll
do
that.
they'll
always
want
party
advantage,
always.
look
to
the
extent
to
which
they
depart
from
historically
drawn
lines.
well,
the
historically
drawn
lines
themselves
are
random.
third,
history.
why
is
history
the
key?
third,
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
minority
party
might
get
the
majority
of
votes,
but
the
minority
of
seats.
whether
they
might
in
the
future,
that
depends
how
people
vote
in
the
future.
there's
no
set
of
lines
where
you
couldn't
imagine
results
that
could
come
out
that
way.
so
how
do
we
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
said
look
to
see
whether
the
traditional
criteria
are
predominantly
ignored.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i'm
referring
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
read
it.
i
understand
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i...
my
question
is,
how
do
your
standards
possibly
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
always
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
draw
a
set
of
lines
such
that
i
couldn't
imagine
a
voting
pattern
such
that
that
wouldn't
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
it's
not...
let...
let
me...
you've
got
me
up
to
the
point
of
this
50/50
business.
now
i'm
thinking.
let's
use
party
names.
it
helps
for
clarity.
suppose
the
democrats
have,
under
the
districting,
they're...
they're
the
ones
who
are
the
victims.
now,
let's
suppose
that
they
did
get
55
percent
of
the
state
vote
for
congress
in
the
next
election.
now,
you're
saying
that
if
it
were
true
by
this
map
that
they're
getting
that
vote,
55
percent,
meant
that
nonetheless,
they
had
to
get
fewer
than
half
the
congressmen,
then
it's
bad.
and
my
problem
with
that
is,
i
don't
see
how
we're
going
to
know
in
advance,
unless
this
is
going
to
be
done
by
some
experts
coming
in
and
measuring
prior
votes
and
getting
into
an
argument.
and
if
that's
what's
going
to
happen,
i
keep
thinking
of
ken...
john
kenneth
galbraith,
who
says,
i'd
rather
be
governed
by
400
people
chosen
at
random
from
the
telephone
book
than
the
harvard
faculty.
all
right,
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
joke,
but
nonetheless,
is
a
serious
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
do
you
see
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i've
exposed
the
entire
problem.
i
want
you
to
respond
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
you're
going
to
say
it's
not
fair,
fairness
in
what
sense?
if
we
say
it's
not
fair
to
draw
lines
that
will
pack
and
crack
one
party
or
another,
you're
going
to
end
up
with
no
geographical
boundaries,
because
all
geographical
boundaries
do
that.
a
random
system
in
pennsylvania
would
give
the
democrats
no
representatives--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--purely
random.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
it's,
i
mean,
my
point
is
that
politicians
and
the
public,
in
fact,
in
form
has
one
idea
of
what's
fair
and
it's
very
hard
for
a
judge
to
turn
that
idea
into
judicially
administrable
rules.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
have
in
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
sorry.
in...
in
my
mind
the,
which
i
don't...
i
want
you
to
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument...
that...
that
one
thing
the
constitution
aims
at,
one
thing
though,
it
wants
to
leave
all
this
up
to
the
legislature
as
much
as
possible,
et
cetera.
but
one
thing
it
aims
at
is
majority
rule.
therefore,
if,
over
a
period
of
time,
we
have
a
districting
system
where
the
minority...
the
majority
who
get
the...
the
majority
of
votes
end
up
with
a
minority
of
seats
in
a
serious
way,
that
undercuts
the
democracy
that
the
constitution
foresees.
and
with
computers,
that
might
happen.
now,
suppose
i
start
with
that
assumption,
and
i'm
looking
for
a
standard.
so
suppose
i
combine
justice
stevens'
standard
with
the
requirement
to
keep
judges
out
of
it,
that
this
has
really
to
have
happened.
it's
not
the
harvard
faculty.
it
really
happened.
and
in
fact,
after
really
happening
once,
then
we
also
have
the
experts
who
tell
us
it
has
to
happen
in
the
future.
now,
we
have
three
things...
three
requirements
there
that
really
are
designed
to
police
the
outer
fringe.
and
if
i
start
with
that
assumption
of
what
the
constitution
wants,
why
don't
i
say
it
imposes
those
three
requirements?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i've
rejected
their
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
rejected
their
test.
i've
borrowed
from
it,
but
rejected
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
the
test
has
the
three
elements
that
i
said.
one,
they're
experts.
two,
it
really
happened.
and
three,
justice
stevens'
objective
version
of
there-is-no-other-explanation
requirement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the...
the...
tell...
answer...
i'll
ask
you
a
question
and
then
you
will
get
away
from
your
prepared
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the...
the...
the...
in...
in
my
own
view,
not...
not
the
court's...
in...
in
my
own
view
in
the
positive
discrimination
race
cases,
i
believed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
positive
discrimination
cases,
the
cases
that
say
you
cannot
draw
a
racial
district,
racial,
minority
district--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
said
you
could,
i
thought
that
the
legislature
could
do
that,
primarily
because
if
they
could
do
that
in
political
party
cases,
why
couldn't
they
do
it
in
race
cases
where
it's
meant
to
help
the
minority?
well,
i
lost
that.
so
believing
what
i
thought,
doesn't
the
reverse
hold
true?
if
this
court
has
found
manageable
standards
to
use
to
control
positive
discrimination
in
favor
of
racial
minorities
for
drawing
boundaries,
then
my
goodness,
why
can't
it
find
standards
to
prevent
the
republicans
from
doing
the
same
thing
to
the
democrats
or
the
democrats
from
doing
the
same
thing
to
the
republicans?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
here,
we're
trying
to...
to
isolate
being
a
democrat
or
being
a
republican--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--from
all
other
factors,
because
after
all,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
they've
been
able
to
come
up
with
no
explanation
other
than
we
did
it
because
they're
democrats.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
the
word
predominate
means--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you'd
insist
on
that
showing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--just
as
you
do
insist
on
the
predominant
showing
in
the
race
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
yes,
there
is,
because
what's
wrong
with
it
is
if
you
carry
it
to
an
extreme
with
computers,
you
prevent
the
majority
of
voters
from
securing
the
majority
of
seats.
and
that
simple
principle
that
the
majority
should
govern
is
the
basic
principle
of
democracy.
so
if
you
find
that
in
the
constitution,
it's
just
as
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
what
we
would
do
is
look
at
the
state
and
we
would
look
to
see
if
in
the...
we
could
even
give
a
margin
of
error.
the
party
that
got
53
percent
of
the
votes
ended
up
with
45
percent
of
the
seats,
okay?
objective,
contrary
to
majority
rule,
and
produced
simply
by
intentional
gerrymandering
for
no
other
purpose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no
proportionality.
forget
the
proportionality.
i
agree
with
you
a
perfectly
random
system
will
produce
100
republican
delegation,
so
i
agree
with
you
about
that.
i'm
only
sticking
to
the
majority
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
if
it
were
the
constitutional
rule,
the
party
could
adjust
and
try
to
run
strong
candidates,
even
in
overwhelmingly
republican
districts.
