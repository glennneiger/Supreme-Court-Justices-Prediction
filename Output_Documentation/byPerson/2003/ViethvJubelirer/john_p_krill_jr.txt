mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
politics
is
inherent
in
redistricting,
any
test,
including
the
appellants'
proposed
test
in
their
reply
brief,
requires
inherent
political
choices
to
be
made,
choices
that
we
submit
are
inappropriate
for
the
judiciary
to
make.
appellants'
latest
test,
for
example,
has
hidden
political
choices
in
it
that
are
outcome
determinative.
for
example,
they
use
10
years
of
statewide
races
rather
than
using
a
single
base
race,
as
recommended
by
the
source
they
cite
in
footnote
5
of
the--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
first,
because
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
question
that
should
ever
come
to
trial.
the
legislative
process
is
so
complex.
every
legislator--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--it...
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
and...
and
i
would
also
say
that
it...
it
is
not
only
impossible
to
prove
at
trial,
but
improper
to
even
attempt
to
prove
at
trial,
because...
and
we'll...
let's
take
district
6
in
pennsylvania
as
an
example.
because
it
would
require
inquiring
into
the
legislative
process
in
violation
of
legislative
privilege.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
legislators
are
pulled
in
a
million
directions.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
if...
if
the
entire
legislature
en
masse
came
forward
and
admitted
that--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--every
legislator
said,
that's
why
i
voted
for
it,
justice
stevens,
i
would
still
say
it's
a
permissible
legislative
choice.
james
madison,
after
all,
in
the
constitutional
convention,
acknowledged
that
they
were
giving
to
state
legislators
the
power
under
article
i,
section
4,
quote,
to
so
mold
their
regulations
as
to
favor
certain
candidates,
closed
quote.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
not
constitutionally,
your
honor,
but
there
are--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--political
forces
that
pull
them
in--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--in
a
multitude
of
directions.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
i--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
that
would
prevent
a...
present
a
federal
question,
your
honor,
but
i'm...
i'm
certain
that
our
supreme
court
in
pennsylvania
would
address
it.
our...
my...
my
individual
clients,
the
legislative
leaders,
in
fact
do
have
higher
salaries,
precisely
for
that
reason.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
no.
i...
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i...
i
can't
imagine
that
even
happening.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
all
right.
accepting
your
assumption,
justice
breyer,
i...
first
of
all,
i...
i
think
that
one
would
have
to
look
at
a
lot
of
different
things.
the
appellants'
test,
for
example,
assumes
that
democrats
are
evenly
disbursed
across
the
state--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--right.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
but
because--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--all
right.
it...
it
really
did
happen
in
pennsylvania
in
2000.
the...
and
this
was
under
a
judicially-drawn
map.
all
right.
the
party
that
had
a
majority
of
the
popular
vote
got
a
minority
of
the
congressional
seats.
the
same
thing
happened
again
in
a...
in
another...
in
a
subsequent
election,
but
it
was
exactly
the
reverse.
you
know,
the
democrats
and
republicans
flipped.
so
it...
it
can,
in
fact,
happen,
your
honor.
but
if
you
allow
the
experts
to
control
over
the
voters,
then
you'll
never
know
the
truth
of
what
would
really
happen.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
in
bandemer
itself.
the
aftermath
of...
of
the
bandemer
case
in
indiana
is
instructive,
because
two
years
after
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
bandemer,
the
democrats,
who
would
have
had
the
court
believe
that
they
were
consigned
to
an
eternity
of
republican
tyranny,
actually
won
50
percent
of
the
state
house
seats
in
indiana.
and
only
two
years
after
that,
in
1990,
they
won
control,
and
control
has
flipped
back
and
forth
ever
since
in
indiana.
so,
i
believe
that
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
in
bandemer
was...
was
quite
on
point.
the
system
is
self-correcting.
now,
the
appellants
test
in
using
10
years,
instead
of
a
base
race
as
their
own
academic
source
recommends,
actually
gives
a
lot
of
weight
to
the
past
preferences
of
voters,
dead
voters,
voters
who
have
moved.
naturally,
this
is
a
political
choice,
because
any
party
that
perceives
this
influence
as
waning
over
time
will
ask
you
to
adopt
a
test
that
gives
weight
to
past
choices.
they
also
use
high
profile
offices
in
choosing
their
races
instead
of
low-profile
statewide
races,
non-charismatic
races
as
their...
as
their
academic
source
recommends.
and,
of
course,
we
have
such
non-charismatic
races
in
pennsylvania.
we
call
them
statewide
appellate
judicial
races.
nothing
could
be
more
non-charismatic.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
and,
of
course,
it...
they've
made
a
political
choice
in
not
using
those
races
either,
because
in
2001,
the
year
that
our
legislature
was
considering
this
plan,
the
republicans
took
seven
out
of
seven
statewide
appellate
races.
they
also,
as...
as...
as
i
mentioned,
in
their
test
assumed
dispersion
of
democrats
uniformly,
when,
in
fact,
democrats,
as
we
all
know,
are
compacted,
self-compacted,
into
urban
areas.
so,
the...
the
test
is
very
tilted.
a
curious
thing
that
they
do
in
their
test
is
turn
real
races
into
hypothetical
races
by
normalizing
them
so
as
to
remove
the
popularity
factor
from
those
races.
well,
that's
curious,
since
politics
is
all
about
trying
to
achieve
that
popular
edge.
what
they
did
not
do,
and
this
is
another
political
choice
in
constructing
the
test,
is
to
a
use
a
very...
a...
a
race
that
was
practically
50/50
in
pennsylvania
in
2000,
a
race,
by
the
way,
that's
cited
in
their
complaint.
it's...
it's
the
al
gore
race
for
president.
mr.
gore
won
50.6
percent
of
the
popular
vote
in
pennsylvania.
now,
the
statistics
show
that
he
also
would
have
won
a
majority
of
the
congressional
districts
under
the
plan
that's
before
this
court
if
he
had
been
packaged
as
a
congressional
candidate.
actually,
he
would
have
won
a
majority,
10
out
of
19
districts.
the
statistics
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
273.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
yeah,
i...
i
confess
that
i
don't
clearly
remember
justice
powell's
standard
for
justiciability
in...
in
his
concurrence,
justice
stevens.
i
do
disagree,
however,
with...
with
his
standard
for...
for
remedial
action.
he
called
for
a
searching
and
sensitive
inquiry.
and
i
submit
there
really
are
no
neutral--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--principles.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
well,
that's
impossible
to
prove
and
improper
to
prove.
for
example--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--justice
powell's
standard
would
require
individual
legislators
to
come
in
and
say,
here's
why
i
voted.
here's...
here's
the...
here's
the--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--there
are
standards
this
court
has
adopted,
the
gingles
standards
for...
for
making...
making
that
case,
your
honor.
however,
i...
i
think--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--well,
yes
you
would,
in
fact.
in
fact,
i
don't
think...
see
how
you
could.
in...
in
this
case,
for
example,
it's
impossible
for
the
appellants'
counsel
to
even
say
whether
their
clients
were
santorum
democrats
or
gore
democrats.
both
won
pennsylvania
in
2000.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
that...
that's
correct.
now,
voters...
they
would
have
to
believe--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--oh,
if,
in
fact,
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
if
the
court
ignores
the
remedial
phase
that
would
necessarily
follow--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--there
are
no--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--it
is,
your
honor.
there
are
no
neutral
criteria.
name
a
criterion
and
i'll
show
you
why
it
represents
a
political
choice.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
respectfully,
justice
stevens,
patterns
of
development
over
the
last
two
generations,
if
you...
if
you
put
them
on
a...
on
a
map,
they
look
like
splatters
of
paint
on
a
canvas.
they're
not
pretty.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
but--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--well,
i
would
point
out
that--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--well,
but...
but
by
saying
that...
by
designating
them
as
neutral
criteria,
the
judiciary
itself
makes
a
choice
and
takes
that
choice
away
from
the
state
legislatures.
voters
are
not
automatons
in
a
matrix
controlled
by
supercomputers.
voters
continue
to
matter,
and
they
continue
to
prove
it
in
election
after
election.
in
fact,
they
proved
it
in
pennsylvania
in
2002
under
this
plan.
the
17th
congressional
district,
which
the
experts
predicted
would
go
republican
did
not.
voters
and
good
candidates
and
good
issues
and
good
party
organization
continue
to
make
the
difference,
just
as
they
did
in--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--not
quite
right.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
well,
but
we...
if...
if
the
plan
had
been
enjoined,
we'd
never
know
how
right
or
wrong
they
were.
and...
and--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
and
in...
in...
in
the
6th
district,
it
was
very
close.
it
was
a
razor-edge
race.
but
voters
continue
to
pull
the
candidates
towards
themselves.
it's...
voters
are
not
disenfranchised.
for
example,
in
our
4th
district
in
western
pennsylvania,
the
incumbent
congresswoman
is...
is
a
fairly
conservative
republican--
mr.
john
p.
krill,
jr.
--thank
you.
