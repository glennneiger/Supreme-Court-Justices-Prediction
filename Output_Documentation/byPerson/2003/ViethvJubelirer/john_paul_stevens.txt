justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
smith,
isn't
it
true
that
what
the
issue
is
sufficiency
of
your
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that...
that
troubles
me
about
the
complaint?
it
seems
to
me
your
complaint
was
drafted
on
the
theory
that
you
agreed
with
justice
powell's
position
in
bandemer,
but
the
position
you've
come
up
with
in
this
court
is
entirely
different
and
not
the
one
that
i
read
into
the
complaint.
your
majority
analysis
theory
is...
is
really
quite
different
from...
from
that
theory.
you...
you
seem
to
have
abandoned
justice
powell.
and
i...
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is,
under
the
theory
of
the
complaint,
as
opposed
to
the
theory
on
which
you're
arguing
in
this
court,
if
you
were...
you
allege
that
there
were
no
neutral
justifications
whatsoever
for
any
district
line.
and
if
you
put
in
proof
to
that
effect
and
the...
and
the
other
side
prove
there
were
neutral
justifications
for
half
the
districts,
say,
but
the...
that
there
were
a
half
that
did
fit
your
allegations,
would...
would...
in
your
view,
would
the
district
court
have
the
authority
to
review
the
districts
that
were
totally
unjustified
without
meeting
your
majority
analysis
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
the
effects,
say
you've
got
two
plaintiffs,
one
from
district
6
and
one
from
16,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if,
for
example,
the...
the
court
thought
that
district
6
had
absolutely
no
justification,
it's
wildly,
you
know,
the
shape
is
so
terrible
and
so
forth,
but
the
rest
of
the
map
was
okay.
under
your
complaint,
could
the
judge
do
anything
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
your
complaint
is
drafted
as
a
all-or-nothing,
but
i'm
just
wondering,
within
the...
within
the
allegations,
would...
would
it
be
open
to
the
judge
to
say,
well,
they
lose
on
the
total
picture,
the
majority
theory
is...
is
just
too...
too
novel
for
me,
but
what
they've
said
about
district
6
pans
out
100
percent.
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
particular
districts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
that
in
the
racial
gerrymandering
context...
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
preliminary
question?
let's
assume
that
them...
that
their
theory
won't
fly,
this
majority
theory
is
just
too
impractical
and
so
forth.
but
what
about
the
theory
advanced
in
their
complaint
that
the...
some
of
the
districts,
and
perhaps
all...
they
allege
all...
were...
were
drafted
by
relying
exclusively
on
a
principle
of
maximum
partisan
advantage?
and
supposing
the
evidence
shows
that
no
neutral
criteria
at
all
were
used
except
let's
do
the
best
we
can
to
help
our
own
party
get
as
many
seats
as
we
can.
would
that
raise
a
question
at
all
in
your
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if...
what
if
they
narrowed
the
allegation,
said
just
district
6
or
district
16
was
clearly
drawn
for
this
purpose
and
no
other,
no
neutral,
no
effort
to
be
compact
or
contiguous
or
follow
boundary
lines
or
rivers
or
anything,
we
just
want
to
get
the
maximum
vote
for
one
particular
party
here.
would
you
say
that
was
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
would
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
just
say
to
the...
when
you
have
a...
a
really
strangely
distorted
district,
the
burden
is
on
you
to
point
out
one
neutral
justification
for
it,
and
we'll
assume
that
if
you...
you
won't
have
to
go
into
the
minds
of
the
legislature,
just
assume
there
is
something
we
can
point
to,
such
as
a
boundary
line
or
if
it's
fairly
compact
or
it's...
but
you
can't
point
to
anything.
you
don't
have
to
go
into
anybody's
mind.
you
just
say...
you
give
them
the
opportunity
to
explain,
and
they...
they
say,
well,
we
have
no
explanation.
we
did
it
just
because
we
want
to
get
that
to
be
a
democratic
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
duty
at
all
to...
any
duty
at
all
in
drawing
districts
to
try
to
do
it
impartially?
your
answer
is
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
on
the
constitution,
what
about
if
the
legislature
decided
that
the
salaries
of
the
majority
legislature
should
be
10
percent
higher
than
the
minority
legislators?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there'd
be
a
good
reason
for
it,
because
they
have
more
work
to
do.
they
have
to
vote
and
they...
they
get
statutes
adopted
and
programs
enacted,
so
would
that
satisfy
the
constitutional
duty?
if
there
is
a
duty
to
govern
impartially,
do
you
think
it
would?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
the...
all
the
members
of
the
majority
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
again
ask
you
just
one
question
about
the
complaint?
do
you
think
it
states
a
cause
of
action
under
the
theory
espoused
by
justice
powell
in
his
davis
against
bandemer
concurrence
in
the
judgment?
and
if
not,
why
not?
and
then
the
final
question
is,
and
if
it
does
meet
that
standard,
why
isn't
that
adequate
judicially
manageable
standards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
first
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--before
you
reach
remedy
is
whether
there's
a
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
his
theory
basically
was,
there's
a
violation
if
there
are
certain
wildly...
wildly-defined
districts
that
have
no
neutral
justification
except
to
give
partisan
advantage
to
the
people
who
had
the
power
to
draft
them
and
who
did
not
even
consult
the
adversary
party
in
drafting
them.
that
was
his
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
matter
of
burden-shifting,
and
if
they
can't
come
up
with
any
explanation
whatsoever
other
than
partisan
advantage,
that
that's
a
violation
of
the...
of
the
duty
to
govern
impartially.
and
either
there
is
no
such
duty
or
it
is
a
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again,
under
justice
powell's
standard,
they
wouldn't
have
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
just
have
to
say,
this
is
totally
irrational
unless
you
can
come
up
with
an
explanation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
the
remedy
would
be
that
redraw
district
using
some
neutral
criteria.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
certainly
not
an
impossible
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
historical
boundaries,
contiguity,
compactness,
maintaining
incumbents
of
both
parties.
there
are
lots
of
neutral
criteria
available,
and
any
one
of
them
might
justify
an
other...
what
seemed
on
its
face
to
be
a
very
wild
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
as
much
as
some--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
as
much
as
the
one
in
karcher
or
the
one
in
this
case
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a...
that's
true,
and
the
only
judicial
call
is
you've
got
to
use
at
least
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
if
that's
true,
is
it
not
obvious
from
the
configuration
of
some
of
the
districts,
that
those
who
drafted
the
districts
thought
they
could
predict
what
they
were
going
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
that
there
is
no
need
for
any
neutral
justification
when
you're
drawing
districts?
that
it
can
be
done
solely
for
the
purpose...
granted
it
be
an
attempt
that
might
not
succeed,
nobody
knows
for
sure
how
people
are
going
to
vote,
but
is
it
permissible
for
a
legislative
body
not
even
to
consult...
i
mean,
the
majority
of
a
legislative
body
not
even
to
consult
another
party,
not
even
to
take
anything
into
consideration
except
trying
to
get
the
maximum
results
at
the...
the
election?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
take
that
position,
then
you
must
be
taking
the
position,
i
guess
you
are,
that
the...
the
holding
in
bandemer
that
this
was
a
just...
justiciable
issue
is
just
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
basic
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this?
do
you
think
the
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action
under
justice
powell's
opinion
in
bandemer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
i
thought
i'd
ask
you.
you
had
fair
warning
of
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
tell
me
you
didn't
read
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
he
doesn't
start
down
the
road
of
electoral
results.
he...
he
focuses
on
intent,
that
it's
an
intent
to
use
nothing
except
a
non-neutral
criterion
in
drafting
the
regulations.
and
you're
suggesting
that's
permissible.
that
would
not
require
counting
votes
after
the
election.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
nothing
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
can
only...
that's
a
matter
of
defense.
you
can't
presume
that
based
on
the
allegations
at
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
did
you
find
it
in
the...
in
the
first
racial
gerrymandering
case?
didn't
you
find
it
partly
by
looking
at
the
shape
of
that
district
in
north
carolina?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
that
shift
the
burden?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the...
the
exclusive
motive
just
is
easier
to
respond
to,
because
all
you
got
to
do
is
come
up
with
one
neutral
justification
and
you
use
the
neutral
justifications
that
the
court
identified
itself
in
the
racial
gerrymandering
cases,
such
as
contiguity
and
compactness
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
that's
exactly
right.
no,
no,
the
premise
of
the...
what
the
question
is
that
there's
a
duty
to
govern
impartially,
and
that
if
you
have
no
duty
except
partisan
advantage,
the
case
is
just
like
saying,
we're
going
to
pay
the
majority
legislatures
a
higher
salary
than
the
minority
legislatures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
can
do
that
as
long
as
it
has
some
other
basis
for
doing
it,
and
that's
history
what
we
did
over
years
and
years
and
years,
states
have
followed
an
attempt
to
get
compact
districts,
your
neighbors
are
in
the
same
voting
area
as
you
are
and
so
forth,
not
these
fancy
designs
that
are
really
a
recent
product
of
politics.
