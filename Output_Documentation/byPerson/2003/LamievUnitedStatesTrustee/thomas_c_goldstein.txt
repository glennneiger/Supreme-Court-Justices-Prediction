mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
parties
to
this
case
agree
on
one
thing,
and
that
is
that
section
330(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
contains
a
mistake
of
some
kind.
now,
we
disagree
about
what
the
mistake
is,
but
there
clearly
is
one.
the
united
states
trustee,
for
all
of
its
rhetoric
about
the
statute's
plain
text,
actually
says
that
the
statute
contains
two
errors
in
two
different
places,
but
the
list
of
compensable
providers
inadvertently
includes
a
reference
to
the
attorney
and
that
the
statute's
so-called
payees'
list
inadvertently
omits
the
necessary
conjunction
or.
we
say
there
was
a
different
mistake,
that
the
payees'
list
inadvertently
omits
the
reference
to
the
debtor's
attorney,
and
our
reading
of
the
two
is
the
superior
one.
it
is
the
one
that's
most
consistent
with
the...
the
structure
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
with
the
past
bankruptcy
practice,
with
the
legislative
history,
and
frankly,
with
common
sense.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
would
be
an
attorney
who's
retained
by
a
trustee,
and
according
to
the
u.s.
trustee,
it
would
also
be
an
attorney
retained
by
a
debtor
in
possession
in
a
chapter
11
case.
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
correct.
the
reason...
and
let
me
take
you
through
the
statutory
scheme,
and
i
should
take
you...
everyone
to
the
text,
and
it's
in
the
blue
brief
at
page
2a
of
the
appendix.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
according
to
the
u.s.
trustee,
no.
let
me,
if
i
could,
just
step
back
and
put
this
in
context.
this
is
a
converted
case,
just
like,
for
example,
the
hartford
underwriters
case
this
court
had
a
few
terms
ago.
and
so
i
take
it
the
question
might
be,
look,
if
they
were
a
debtor's
attorney
at
one
point...
and
we
all
agree
that
for
the
chapter
11
proceedings,
they
clearly
were
authorized
to
be
paid
under
330(a)...
could
that
authorization
have
continued?
and
i
think
the
answer
is
no
because
at
some
point
there
will
be
a
fee
application
and
the
fee
application
will
be
under
330(a),
and
what
will
happen
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
u.s.
trustee
or
the
objector
will
say,
look,
for
the
period
that
it
was
a
chapter
7,
there's
a...
a
gap
in
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
oh,
no,
no,
no.
our
position
is
to
the
contrary.
the
u.s.
trustee's
position
is
that
it...
they're
without
power.
i
think
it's
an
important
point.
we
view
the
structure
of
the
statute
to
operate
just
as
it
has
for...
the
bankruptcy
code
has
for
100
years,
and
that
is,
that
the
bankruptcy
court
is
a
gatekeeper.
it
has
to
decide,
in
what
are
now
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute,
whether
the
services
of
the
debtor's
attorney
are
both
necessary
and
beneficial
to
the
estate.
the
position
of
the
u.s.
trustee
is
that
even
when
the
services
are
both
necessary
and
beneficial
to
the
estate...
that
is
to
say,
even
when
they
produce
more
money
for
the
creditors,
which
is
the
whole
point,
after
all...
you
still
can't
perform
the
services
and
be
compensable--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--because
there
are
things
that
the
bankruptcy
code
assigns
as
responsibility
to
the
debtor,
not
the
trustee.
and
second,
the
provision
that...
and
so
let
me...
let
me
separate--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
let
me
take
you
to
the
relevant
statutory
provision.
this
one
is
in
the
gray
brief
in
the
appendix.
that's
327(e).
there
is
a
passing
suggestion
in
the
government's
brief...
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
at
1a
of
the
gray
brief.
it's
at
the
bottom.
there
is
a
suggestion
by
the
u.s.
trustee
that
if
the
debtor's
attorney
really
needs
to
do
something,
the
trustee's
lawyer
will
hire
the
debtor's
lawyer,
and
so
it
all
will
work
out
in
the
end,
and
i
take
it
that's
a
point
you're
picking
up.
the
statute
is
much
more
limited
than
that.
it
says
the
trustee,
with
the
court's
approval,
may
employ
for
a
specified
special
purpose,
other
than
to
represent
the
trustee,
and
it
goes
on
to
say,
an
attorney
that
has
represented
the
debtor.
the
way
this
works...
and
we
have
tried
very
hard
to
find
out
how
often
this
happens.
mr.
lamie's
firm,
for
example,
has
been
doing
bankruptcy
for
23
years
and
has
represented
the
debtor
in
more
than
4,000
cases.
in
that
entire
time,
the
trustee
has
hired
the
debtor's
counsel
two
times.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
we
know
that
that's
not
the
case,
justice
souter,
because
the
bankruptcy
code
does,
as
justice
kennedy
has
suggested,
give
important
responsibilities
to
the
debtor
qua
debtor,
not
that
are
distinct
from
the
duties
of
the
trustee.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
that.
and
so
those
are
jobs
that
can't
be
handled
by
the
trustee.
they're
the
responsibility
of
the
debtor.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
actually
there
is.
the...
the
problem
is
that
the
debtor
and
the
trustee
sometimes
have
divergent
interests.
that's
why
the
legislative
history
to
327(e)
says
we
want
to
limit
the
times
that
the
trustee
will
hire
the
debtor's
lawyer.
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--an
exemption
fight.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
an
exemption
fight.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
when
you're
trying
to...
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
debtor
gets
to
claim
an
exemption.
and
so
let
me
give
you
a
couple
more
examples
just
about
how
this
operates.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
but
the
fact
that
in
relative
terms,
in
terms
of
the
percentage
of
chapter
7's,
it's
not
that
big
a
deal
does
not
mean
in
absolute
terms
it's
not.
we
know,
for
example,
that
there
are
at
least
40,000
asset
cases.
in
particular,
we
have
complicated
business
cases.
hartford
underwriters,
which
you
all
had
as
a
case,
is
an
example.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
a
lot
of
converted
business
cases.
generally
when
we
believe
there's
going
to
be
an
asset,
they
are
pursued
as
a
11's,
but
lots
of
times
the
ability
to
keep
up
with
the
creditors
breaks
down
and
they
can
get
converted
to
7's.
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--in
all
candor,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that's
a
point
in
their
favor.
it's
just
not
one
that's
going
to
overcome
the
other
indications
of
congress'
intent.
so
let
me
speak
to
that
and
then
what
the
other--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
and
then
i
will
come
back
to
justice
o'connor.
the
point
here
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
cases...
and
we
cite
these
in
our
brief...
that
the
expressio
unius
canon,
on
which
you're...
to
which
you're
adverting--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
let
me
explain
to
why
i
think
you
are,
and
then
you
can
tell
me
why
i'm
misguided,
i'm
sure.
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
united
states
v.
wilson.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
united
states
v.
wilson,
and
then
i'll
come
back
to
why
i
think
their
argument
is
an
expressio
unius
one,
and
then
i'll
explain
to
you
u.s.
v.
wilson.
it's
on
page
10
of
the
yellow
brief
that
we
discuss
it.
the
statute
says
that
the
court
may
award
to
a
trustee,
an
examiner,
or
professional
person
employed
under
section
327.
i'm
back
on
2a
of
the
blue
brief.
it
has
a
list.
it
doesn't
say
only,
and
there
are
many
cases.
there
are
legions
of
cases
in
which
a
list
is
not
regarded
as
exclusive
when...
i
think
there's
a
presumption
of
exclusivity,
but
when
the
contrary
indications
in
the
text
or
the
history
of
the
drafting
or
something
else
tells
you
that
congress
didn't
intend
the
list
to
be
exclusive,
and
this
is
such
a
case.
the
reason
i
cite
u.s.
v.
wilson
to
you
is
that's
a
case
in
which
the
statute
referred
specifically
to
the
attorney
general.
the
attorney
general,
before
the
statute
was
revised,
was
supposed
to
compute
the
amount
of
time
that
is
given
as
credit
from
pretrial
detention.
congress,
as
it
did
with
section
330,
rewrote
the
statute
entirely,
and
this
court
said,
look,
we
admit
that
the
reference
to
the
attorney
general
is
gone,
but
it
looks
like
it
just
got
lost
in
the
shuffle
if
we
look
at
the
other
indications
of
congress'
intent.
now,
let
me
just
make
one
other
important--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
this
court
has
never
really
taken
that
view
of
subsequent
legislative
history,
justice
o'connor,
but
let
me
turn
to
the
events.
in
1997,
there
were
two
bills
that
were
proposed
in
the
congress
that
were
a
part
of
general
correction
legislation
that
had
a
variety
of
different
provisions,
including
one
fix
for
this
one.
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
at
that
time,
the
only
case
in
the
circuits
interpreting
the
statute
as
it
then
stood
went
our
way.
it
was
the
1996
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
ames.
and
so
i
don't
think
you
can
infer
from
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
change
the
statute
to
confirm
the
rule
in
the
circuits
means
that
they
intended
to
reject
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is,
but
justice
ginsburg...
so
now
we
have
not
just
the
failure
to
enact
legislation
exists,
but
the
u.s.
trustee
is
relying
on
the
failure
to
enact
legislation
that
doesn't
even
exist.
the
point,
i
think,
is
that,
look,
if
you
read
the
statute,
if
you
look
at
it
right
now,
it's
simply
ambiguous.
there's
a
reference
to
the
attorney
that's
in
there,
and
a
reference
to
the
attorney
that's
missing.
this
is
not
a
case...
and
this
is
absolutely
critical...
in
which
there
was
a
reference
to
the
attorney,
there
was
only
one,
and
it
disappeared,
and
we're
asking
you
to
read
it
back
in.
our
position
is
that
the
statute,
as
written,
stands
essentially
in
equipoise.
the
two
references
to
the
attorney
in
the
1978
version
of
the
statute
were
inextricably
intertwined,
and
so
if
you
look
at
the
text
right
now,
the
fact
that
congress
hasn't
changed
it
doesn't
tell
you
anything
about
whether
or
not
they
intend
it
to
be
in
there
or
not
to
be
in
there
because
the
split
is
almost
even.
there's
one--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
i
agree,
and
i...
i'm
obviously
not
making
this
point
well
enough.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
inference
that
would
be
normally
drawn
from
the
failure
to
fix
a
statutory
error
doesn't
cut
in
either
direction
here
because,
as
i
began
in
the
introduction,
both
sides
believes
there...
believes
that
there's
an
error.
but
we
both
think
there's
a
mistake
in
the
statute.
the
fact
that
congress
hasn't
corrected
the
mistake
doesn't
tell
us
anything
about
what
the
mistake
was.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we...
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
stevens,
let
me
put
that
series
of
events
in
slightly
more
context,
and
that
is
that
in
the
house,
when
the
bill
was
not
pending
there,
there
was
a
hearing,
and
this
is
one
line
in
a
718-page
record
of
just
written
materials
submitted
that
says
there
is
an
inadvertent
omission.
the...
the
one
canon
of
construction
that
runs
through
this
court's
bankruptcy
cases--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
important
to
note,
of
course,
that
when
the
department
of
justice
and
the
u.s.
trustee
commented
on
the
bill
at
the
time,
they
did
not
say
that
this
would
be
the
result
of
the
statute
or
that
they
proposed
it.
but
i
don't...
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
that
when
someone
says
there's
a
mistaken
omission...
and
remember,
it's
of
course
at
the
time
when
the
u.s.
trustee
says
language
is
mistakenly
included
at
the
same
time.
when
someone
says
there's
a
mistake,
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
congress...
let's
engage
in
all
of
the
false
assumptions
that
people
actually
read
this
thing
in
the
senate
and
people
paid
attention...
that
congress
actually
acknowledged,
yes,
we're
changing
bankruptcy
policy.
the
standards
for
changing
bankruptcy
policy,
particularly
a
policy
as
settled
as
this
one,
are
much
higher--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
indications
in
this
court's
precedents...
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
those
would
be
principally
the
line
of
cases
that
begin
with
midatlantic.
we
cite
several
of
them,
hartford
underwriters,
ron
pair,
that
sort
of
thing.
the
court
has
recognized,
going
back
to
well
before
the
'78
code
and
subsequent
to
the
'78--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
that
the
relevant
answer
would
be
that
cohen
v.
de
la
cruz,
which
deals
with
a
much
more
minor
revision
of
the
bankruptcy
code
than
even
this
one,
the
1984
revision
applies
the
same
principle
and
that
is
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
are
incredibly
interrelated.
there's
a
longstanding
practice
that
has
built
up
over
time,
and
that
congress
doesn't
lightly
change
it.
and
let
me
talk
about
why
this
would
have
to
be
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
i
think
i'm
responding
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i...
i
think...
i
think
we
have
a
new
thread.
perhaps
the
best
answer
to
your
point
is
green
v.
the
bach
laundry,
which
is
not
a
case
that's
discussed
in
the...
in
the
briefs,
but
i
will
explain
how
this
arises.
and
that
is,
federal
rule
of
evidence
609
said,
look,
if
there's
going
to
be...
if
you're
going
to
impeach
a
defendant,
you
get
to
use
prior
convictions,
and
the
court
looked
at
it
and
said,
really,
it
says
defendants,
and
we
acknowledge
it
means
all...
you
know,
that
the
plain
language
of
that
is
all
defendants,
and
the
court
inserted
the
word
criminal
and
said
from
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--inserted
the
word
criminal.
it
said
that
rule
609
would
only
apply
to
criminal
defendants.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
all
right.
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
i
probably
am
not
going
to
have
a
case
that
satisfies
you,
but
i
think
that
i
can
dispute
successfully
the
premise,
and
that
is,
i
do
believe
that
your
premise
is
that
expressio
unius
applies.
i
promised
i
would
come
back
to
that
point.
and
the
text
says,
the
court
may
award
to
a
trustee,
an
examiner,
or
professional
person.
it
doesn't
say
to
only
those
people.
what
i'm
telling
you
is
that
the
other...
the
remaining
indications
of
congress'
intent
indicate
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
limit
the
payment
to
go
to
those
people.
and
second,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
only
we
have
a
textual
problem.
remember
that
the
u.s.
trustee,
just
as
you
say
we
have
to
read
in
a...
a
word,
they
have
to
read
out
a
word.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
think
you
and
justice
breyer
may
be
making
a
similar
point
here,
and
that
is,
look,
if
we
had
the
text
and
all
we
had
was
the
text,
it
would
do
less
violence
you
say,
and
i
think
i
can
conceded
it
would
do
less
violence
to
read
in
the...
the
word
rather
than
to
render
the
other
one
superfluous
or
read
it
out.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
before
you
because
you
don't
just
have
the
text.
if
you...
this
was
all
that
there
was,
you
could
apply
a
canon
like
that
one.
it
would
do
less
harm,
you
know,
the
principle
of
sort
of
do
no
harm.
but
what
i'm
telling
you
is
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
that
the
provisions
of
the
payees'
and
the
providers'
lists
are
inextricably
intertwined,
that
the
trustee
can
be
paid
for
the
services
of
the
trustee,
the
examiner
for
services
of
the
examiner,
the
professional
person
for
services
of
the
professional
person.
and
then
there's
this
gap
for
services
of
the
attorney.
there's
an
ambiguity.
and
so
just
like
any
other
case
in
which
you
have
to
resolve
a
statutory
ambiguity,
you
look
to
other
things.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to
get
down
to
the
number
of
words
or
syllables
or
anything
like
that.
i
think
perhaps
a
more
fair...
if
we're...
again,
in
the
world
of
tie-breakers
looking
only
at
the
text,
it's
that
the
u.s.
trustee's
position
requires
you
to
conclude
that
there
are
mistakes
in
two
different
places,
in
both
the
payees'
list,
the
missing
conjunction
or,
and
the
providers'
list,
the
inadvertent--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
there's
any
greater
canon
that
says
we
find
errors
presumptively
in
second
provisions
rather
than
first
ones.
there
are
much
greater
indications
of
congress'
intent
than
that.
we
have
a
lot
more
to
work
with.
i
do
think
i
need
to
make
two
points.
the
first
is
justice
o'connor
has,
to
some
extent,
focused
on
what
happened
here,
you
know,
what
did
congress
know.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize,
as
i
started
to
say,
this
would
be
a
change
without
any
consideration
by
congress
at
all.
this
statute
started--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right,
justice
stevens,
let
me
distinguish
two
different
periods
of
time.
i
was
about
to
talk
about...
and
we'll
come
back
to
when
this...
the
words
got
dropped
out.
you're
focusing
later,
and
so
let
me
answer
your
question
with...
try
and
answer
it
in
a
somewhat
different
way,
and
that
is,
the
only
thing
that
was
pointed
out
to
them
was
that
there
was
a
mistake.
and
if
you
look
at
the
text,
you
don't
know
what
congress'
intent
was.
was
it
to
leave
the
language
in
or
to
delete
it?
because
there
are
two
parallel,
intertwined
references
to
the
attorney.
i
had
said
that
i
would
come
back
to
the
'84...
to
the
'94
change.
this
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
thought
was
so
important.
that
is,
it
mistakenly
thought--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
the
reference
in...
i'm
on
2a
of
the
blue
brief,
11
u.s.c.
330(a),
subsection
(1)(a),
what
we've
called
the
providers'
list.
and
this
providers'
list
parallels
the
one
in
section
331.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
reasonable
compensation
for
actual,
necessary
services
rendered
by
the
trustee,
examiner,
professional
person,
or
attorney.
so
what
happened
is
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
it...
as
has
been
suggested,
literally
it
could.
you
could
render
it
surplusage
or
you
could
say
it's
the
attorney
of
the
trustee.
but
a
few
things
about
that.
we
know
it
really
is
surplusage
because
there's
already
a
reference
to
the
attorney
of
the
trustee.
that's
the
professional
person.
this
was
one
of
the
first
questions--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is,
justice
souter.
the
reference
in
this
line
to
a
professional
person
is
the
professional
person
employed
under
section
327.
that's
the
trustee's
attorney.
the...
and
the
united
states
doesn't
dispute
this.
it
acknowledges
that
it
is
surplusage.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
ah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
apologize.
the
trustee
is
not
empowered
to...
i...
i
think
i
may
have
confused
you
back
at
the
beginning
of
this.
the
trustee
is
not
empowered
to
hire
a
person
to
represent
the
debtor.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
if
so,
we
win.
[laughter]
and
there
will
be
an
explanation
to
follow.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
all
should
assume
that
all...
the
answer
to
all
the
questions,
if
so,
we
win,
because
what
would
happen
is
that,
remember,
literally
the
debtor's
attorney
may
be...
provides
compensable
services,
and
then
the
ambiguity
that
justice
breyer
has
focused
on
and
then
you
have
is
that
we
have
the
question
of,
okay,
who...
who
gets
the
money.
does
it
go
to
the
trustee,
the
examiner,
or
the
professional
person?
so
if
the
trustee
gets
paid
for
the
services
of
the
debtor's
attorney...
remember,
this
is
a
case
in
which
mr.
lamie
acted
at
the
request
of
the
trustee...
then
the
trustee
has
to
turn
the
money
over.
the
money
actually
belongs
to
mr.
lamie.
he
provided
the
services.
that's
how
it
would
all
work
together.
and
that
is,
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where
the
debtor's
attorney
acts
at
the
request
of
the
trustee...
this
case
is
your
hypothetical.
the
money
goes
to
the
trustee
who
then
obviously
has
to
turn
it
over
the
attorney.
that's
who
would
have
the
equitable
interest
in
it.
if
i
could
retain
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
that
the
u.s.
trustees
are
not
finding
that
this
ambiguity
creates
a
problem
is
that
there
has
been
a
shift
in
practice
in
those
courts
like
the
fourth
circuit
that
hold
that
you
can't
be
compensated
as
a
chapter
7
debtor's
attorney
under
330,
and
that
is
people
in
bigger
cases
are
getting
bigger
and
bigger
retainers.
what's
happening
is
the
scenario
that
justice
stevens
described,
and
that
is,
people
are
saying
i'm
not
going
to
be
paid
on
an
ongoing
basis,
so
i've
got
to
get
more
money
up
front.
that
can't
be
a
result
that
congress
contemplated
under
the
u.s.
trustees'
vision
of
what
congress
was
up
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--precisely,
precisely.
but
that's
my
point.
what
results
is
the
329
fees
are
subject
to
a
lessing
standard.
they
just
have
to
be
reasonable.
they
aren't
subjected
to
all
the
laundry
list
of
330.
so
the
result
of
this
change,
if
there
was
a
change,
would
only
have
been
to
decrease
judicial
oversight.
retainers
are
subject
to
less
to
judicial
scrutiny.
the
second
point
i
should
make
is
that
don't
come
away
from
the
argument
that
this...
believing
that
this
case
is
limited
to
chapter
7.
it
applies
equally
to
chapter
11
debtor
out
of
possession
cases
and
chapter
12
and
13
cases
for
services
that
are
beneficial
to
the
estate,
but
not
the
debtor.
the
u.s.
trustee
has
always
pitched
this
as
somehow
a
case
limited
to
chapter
7,
but
that's
not
accurate.
and
the
pro-snax
case
from
the
fifth
circuit,
for
example,
is
a
chapter
11
debtor
out
of
possession
case.
third,
justice
souter,
i
still
don't
understand
what
the
answer
is
to
your
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
breyer,
justice
souter
said,
okay,
there
are
a
list
of
three
people
who
can
get
the
check:
the
trustee,
the
examiner,
the
professional
person.
fine.
but
we
also
know,
as
justice
stevens
has
said,
that
the
statute's
reference
to
the
attorney
has
always
been
to
the
attorney,
the
same
reference
to
the
attorney
in
331
is
a
reference
to
the
attorney.
321
says
a
chapter
7
attorney
can
get
a
retainer.
justice
souter
has
said
isn't
the
literal
language,
if
we're
going
to
follow
the
literal
language,
that
the
money
can
go
to
the
trustee,
to
which
i
said,
and
that's...
you
know,
the
trustee
directed
mr.
lamie
to
do
these
things,
and
therefore
the
trustee
just
owes
the
money
back
to
the
debtor's
attorney.
that
rationalizes
all
of
the
text.
the
important
thing
then
in
deciding
whether
to
follow
the
literal
text
is,
is
there
anything
to
support?
is
there
a
whit...
a
whit...
of
indication
in
the
history
of
the
statute
that
congress
intended
to
do
what
the
u.s.
trustee
has
hypothesized?
is
there
a
word
that
from
1898
to
1994
congress
decided
to
make
this
choice
to
eliminate
fees
that
are
both
necessary
and
beneficial?
those
are
the
only
fees
we're
talking
about,
those
that
benefit
the
creditors.
did
congress
intend
to
eliminate
them?
is
there
any
indication
of
that?
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
and
that's
important
because
the
u.s.
trustee
is
not
correct
to
say
that
when
a
chapter
7
is
initiated
or
if
the
case
is
converted,
that
the
debtor
and
the
debtor's
attorney
leaves
the
field.
there
are
ongoing
duties.
there's
the
341
hearing,
the
meeting
with
the
creditors.
there
is
the
duty
of
the
debtor's
attorney
to
transfer
the
materials
to
the
trustee,
to
cooperate
with
the
trustee.
here,
there
was
an
adversary
proceeding.
the
trustee
wasn't
substituted
as
counsel
for
8
months,
and
somebody
had
to
tell
the
trustee
about
that.
there
are
real
responsibilities.
and
we're
not
talking
about,
in
any
particular
case,
a
ton
of
money,
but
it
is
important.
