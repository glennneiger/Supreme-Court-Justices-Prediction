anthony
m.
kennedy
the
petitioner,
in
this
case
john
lamie,
is
a
bankruptcy
attorney,
and
the
case
considers
whether
a
petitioner
is
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
for
work
he
did
on
behalf
of
a
bankrupt
debtor.
the
bankruptcy
case
for
the
petitioner’s
client
began
as
a
reorganization
proceeding
under
chapter
11.
the
client
as
debtor
in
possession
retained
the
petitioner
as
its
attorney
in
the
matter.
no
one
disputes
the
petitioner
is
entitled
the
fees
for
the
work
he
did
in
the
connection
with
this
chapter
11
reorganization
proceeding.
but
in
bankruptcy,
proceedings
can
change
form
one
chapter
to
another,
and
that
happened
here.
the
chapter
11
case
was
then
converted
to
a
chapter
7
liquidation
proceeding.
after
the
conversion,
the
petitioner
continued
to
provide
services
to
the
debtor
facilitating
the
liquidation
proceedings.
a
chapter
7
bankruptcy
trustees,
who
have
responsibility
for
preserving
the
bankruptcy
estate,
did
not
employ
the
petitioner
to
do
the
work
however.
this
case
considers
whether
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
attorney's
fees
for
this
later
work,
the
fees
to
be
paid
from
the
chapter
7
bankruptcy
estate.
the
outcome
depends
on
an
interpretation
of
section
330(a)(1)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
because
it
is
detailed
and
textual,
those
who
are
interested
will
have
to
refer
to
the
opinion
to
see
the
precise
analysis
if
the
court
follows.
suffusive
to
say
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
divided
over
the
proper
interpretation
of
this
section,
and
a
conflict
arises
because
the
section
is
awkward
and
ungrammatical
in
its
wording
and
its
structure.
the
courts
that
have
allowed
fees
in
these
circumstances
begin
by
saying
that
this
makes
the
statute
ambiguous.
the
earlier
statute
had
allowed
fees
in
these
circumstances
and
these
courts
say
that
the
legislative
history
showed
there
was
no
intent
to
alter
the
law
in
this
respect.
now,
we
disagree
with
this
result
and
agree
instead
with
the
courts
that
find
that
the
statute
is
unambiguous.
the
statute
is
indeed
awkward
and
ungrammatical
in
part
because
it
contains
a
surplus
word,
but
where
there
are
two
ways
to
read
a
statute:
to
find
the
statute
plain
even
though
it
has
a
surplus
word
or
to
disregard
the
surplus
word
and
treat
the
statute
as
ambiguous,
the
rule
against
interpreting
the
statute
to
contain
a
surplus
word
is
inappropriate
absent
other
indications.
here,
the
statute
awkward
and
ungrammatical
but
it
may
be
still
provide
us
clear
direction,
and
that
direction
is
to
deny
this
where
the
attorney
has
not
been
employed
by
the
trustee
and
approved
by
the
court,
and
we
find
it
instructive
furthermore
that
the
legislative
history
creates
more
confusion
than
clarity
about
congressional
intent.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
fourth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
joins
all
but
part
three
of
the
opinion;
justice
stevens
concurs
in
the
judgment;
justices
souter
and
breyer
are
joining
the
opinion
for
the
court
and
also
join
justice
stevens.
