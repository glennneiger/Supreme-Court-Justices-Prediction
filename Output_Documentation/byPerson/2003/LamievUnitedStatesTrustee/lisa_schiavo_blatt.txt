mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
bankruptcy
code
contains
no
authority
to
use
estate
funds
that
are
held
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
to
compensate
the
chapter
7
debtor's
attorney.
before
1994,
the
code
authorized
estate
funds
to
be
used
to
compensate
all
debtors'
attorneys,
but
the
1994
amendments
unambiguously
deleted
the
chapter
7
debtors'
attorneys
from
the
class
of
persons
eligible
to
receive
compensation
under
the
statute.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
only
the...
if...
an
attorney,
including
the
debtor's
attorney,
can
still
be
compensated,
but
he
has
to
be
appointed
by
the
court
under
section
327
and
then
he
stands
as
a
professional
person
that's
retained
under
327,
but
that
has
to
be
retained
under
327.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
superfluous
in
this
sense.
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
the
same
regardless
because
the
attorney
is
nothing
more
than
a
subset
of
professional
persons.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
but
congress
may...
it
may
have
failed
to
make
a
conforming
change,
but
it's
also
possible
that
congress
specifically
left
the
word
in
because
congress
often
uses
overlapping
terms
to
accomplish
its
objectives.
and
it
was
doing
no
harm
there,
and
it
would
at
least
remove
any
doubt
that
even
the
debtor's
attorney
could
be
paid
as
long
as
he
qualified
as
a
professional
person
that
was
retained
under
327.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct,
but
there's
no
question
that
the...
the
code,
as
it
now
stands,
has...
omits
the
debtor's
attorney
from
one
of
the
authorized
people.
and
what
petitioner
is
basically
seeking,
justice
stevens,
is
a
substantive
enlargement
of
the
code
because
he
wants
to
do
something,
that
is,
receive
a--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
fine.
the
debtor's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it
could
still
mean
the
debtor's
attorney,
but
there's
no
question
in
this
case
petitioner
was
not
authorized
to
be
retained
by
the
trustee
under
section
327.
the
debtor's
attorney
is
unambiguously
not
one
of
the
list
of
people
in
330(a)
who
is
authorized
to
receive
compensation,
just
like
a
creditor's
attorney
is
not
on
that
list
or
a
debtor's
spouse
is
not
on
that
list.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
i
think
it
reflects
the
fundamental
distinction
between
chapter
7
and
all
other
codes.
that's
chapters
11,
12,
and
13.
in
a
chapter
7
case,
the
bulk
of
the
work
is
done
pre-petition.
it's
advising
the
debtor
about
which
chapter
to
file,
filling
out
the
schedules,
telling
the
debtor
what
property
is
exempt,
and
so
forth.
and
in
chapters
11,
12,
and
13,
the
whole
game
is
in
doing
a
plan
which
is
all
post-petition,
and
the
trustee
and
the
debtor,
the...
excuse
me...
the
debtor
and
the
creditors
work
together
to
figure
out
a
plan.
ms.

blatt
justice
kennedy,
there's
no
question
that
both
before
and
after
the
1994

chapter
7
debtors
retained
counsel,
but
they
do
so
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
with
a
pre-petition
flat
fee,
usually
750

ms.

it's

but
i'm
talking
about
the
standard,

if
somebody
walks
in

they've

and
they

the

are

do
this--
ms.

it's...
it's
critical
to
understand
that
in
chapter
7,
unlike
all
other
chapters,
the...
the
estate
is
frozen
at
the
time
of
petition.
98
percent
of
all
chapter
7
debtors
are
individuals.
if
they
have
a
job
or
any
post-petition
income
or
there
are
exempt
assets,
they
can
use
that
money
to
pay
the...
pay
counsel
to
assist
them
in
completing
bankruptcy.
and
i
want
to...
do
want
to
address
one
very...
one
class
of
very
important
services
that
came
up
that
i
think,
justice
souter,
you
raised,
and
that
is
when
the
debtor
and
the
trustee
or
creditors
are
fighting
over
objections
to
exemption.
they
could
also
be
fighting
over
objections
to
discharge.
these
are
serious
matters
where
often
the
debtor
is
accused
of
misconduct
and
the
debtor
will
need
a
lawyer.
there's
no
question
that
even
before
the
1994
amendments,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
courts
would
have
held
that
those
are
services
that
benefit
the
personal...
that
go
to
the
personal
benefit
of
the
debtor
and
not
the
estate.
and
they
would
not
have
been
compensable
even
before
1994,
and
if
this...
if
this
court
is
going
to
take
the
extraordinary
step
of
writing
it
back
in,
it
will
not
affect
those
cases.
and
so--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--sure.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
for
the
code
as
it...
what...
this
is
a...
a
pro-creditor
provision
that
recognizes
that
debtors
will
often
go
to
counsel
before
they
file
bankruptcy,
and
anyone,
whether
or
not
you
seek
compensation
under
the
statute,
any
lawyer
for
any
debtor
who
ultimately
files
for
bankruptcy
has
to
disclose
their
fee
arrangement,
and
the
court
can
order
the
cancellation
of
it
or
return
of
the
fee
if
it's
excessive
or
unreasonable.
ms.
lisa

pre-petition.
this
is
for
a...
any
type
of
fee
arrangement
that's
pre-petition
whether
or
not
you
apply
for
compensation.
there
are
many
cases
where
the
chapter...
excuse
me...
the
debtor's
counsel
will,
in
fact,
be
paid
under
12,
under
13,
under
11,
and
those--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
any...
any
debtor.
even
if
there
was
an
express
prohibition
for
money
for
the
estate
to
be
paid,
section
329
would
still
independently
operate
to
require
the
counsel
to
disclose
his
fee
agreement.
it
applies
whether
or
not
compensation
is
ever
sought
under
330.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right,
but
that's...
that's
pre-petition.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
right.
so
it
remained
the
funds
of
the
estate
and
it
had
to
be
paid
under
330
and
it
was...
it
was
not
a
question
of
329.
but
the
other...
other
point
i
want
to
get
back
on
why
this
serves
reasonable
policy
objectives,
not
only
does
the
individual
debtor
have
the
ability
to
pay
counsel
with
either
his
exempt
assets,
his
post-petition
income,
or
a
pre-petition
flat
fee,
but
chapter
7,
unlike
all
other
cases,
it
is
the
trustee
and
not
the
debtor
who
manages,
represents,
and
liquidates
the
estate.
and
the
code
gives
the
trustee
the
explicit
authority
under
section
327
of
the
code
to
retain
counsel,
including
the
debtor's
counsel,
to
take
actions
that
further
the
benefit...
the
best
interests
of
the
estate.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
that's
exactly
right.
if
the...
if
for
some
reason
the
trustee
could
not
read
an
accounting
form
and
the
debtor's
counsel
couldn't
answer
it,
the
trustee
can
go
retain
a
professional
person
like
an
accountant,
and
if
the
trustee
needs
a
lawyer
to
take
actions
to
further
the
best
interests
of
the
estate,
it
is
true
that
that
lawyer
represent
the...
represents
the
estate,
but
there's
no
reason
he
can't
meet
with
the
debtor
and
help
him
explain
something.
but
96
percent
of
all
chapter
7
cases,
there
are
no
assets
in
the
estate
to
begin
with.
these
are
the
kind
of
cases
i
was
talking
about,
where
they
are
covered
by
a
routine
flat
fee
that
covers--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
true,
and
in
those
cases--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
it
goes
to
the
idea
that
given
that
there's
a
plain
absence
of
any
statutory
authority
to
do
this,
the
question
is,
is
this
some
sort
of
absurd
result
that
congress
could
not
have
plausibly
intended?
and
in
the
4
percent
of
categories
where
there
are
assets,
justice
stevens,
the
trustee
represents
the
estate.
he
manages
it
and
he
liquidates
it.
and
if
there's
money
to
be
paid
to...
for
counsel
and
the
counsel's
services
are
needed,
the
trustee
can
use
that
money
and
retain
counsel.
at
the
same
time,
the
chapter
7
debtor--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right.
and
at
the
same
time,
there
is--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
1994
amendments
that
prevents
the
debtor
from
taking
his
post-petition
salary,
his
exempt
assets--
ms.
lisa

blatt
--right.
in
a...
in
a
company,
your
honor,
it's
important,
justice
ginsburg,
to
keep
in
mind
everything
like
objections
to
discharge,
exempt
assets...
none
of
that
applies
to
corporations.

unlike
individuals,
do
not
survive
bankruptcy,
and
so
they
don't
have
issues
like
exempt
assets
and
objections
to
discharge.
you
have
a
defunct
corporation
that's
liquidating.
and
we
think
this
case
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
what
happens
when
you
have
a
case
with
marginal
assets
in
chapter
7,
and
that's
usually
where
the...
the
businesses
with
no
assets
or
marginal
assets
go,
is
chapter
7.
the
trustee
had
ample
authority
to
retain
petitioner's
counsel,
and
in
fact,
what
happened
ultimately
in
this
case
is
what...
the
bulk
of
what
petitioner's
counsel
was
doing
was
representing
the
estate
in
a
fight
with
a
creditor
and--
ms.
lisa

--no.
when
the
case
is
in

the
debtor
is
the
debtor
in

with
all
the
powers
and
duties
of
the

and
it's
solely
the

there
is
no

has
to
take

all
that
changes
when
it
converts

the
keys
have
to
be

runs
the
show.
ms.

this...
i

i'll
try
to
take
you
chronologically.
the
case
started
out
an
11,
and
then
the
petitioner
was...
was
retained
under
section
327,
had
a
specific
order,
and
therefore
was
entitled
to
be
paid
from
the

was

ceased.
there
was
nothing
for
the

then
it's

in
this
case
and
$3
in
expenses,
and
$1,000
has
been
paid
for
all

and
what
will

if
the
court
affirms

circuit,
is

cases
convert,
the

counsel
will
cease
performing
work

under
28
u.s.c.
586,
it's...
it's
a
laundry
list
of
specific
statutory
duties
that
the
united
states
trustees
have
to
comply
with.
under
the
bankruptcy
code
itself,
in
11
u.s.c.
307,
it
says
that
the
united
states
trustees
may
be...
may
raise
or
be
heard
on
any
matter
in
any
bankruptcy
case,
and
that's
why
they've
been
in
all
of
these
cases
involving
fee
applications
because
in
their
view,
given
the...
that
there's
just
complete
absence
of
any
statutory
authority
to
pay
chapter
7
debtor's
counsel,
they've
been
objecting
to
fee
requests.
the
one
thing
i
just
want
to
get
back
to
on
the
statute
is
petitioner
says
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
and
we
could
not
disagree
more.
there
is
no
language
in
the
code
that
authorizes
the
chapter
7
to
be
paid.
what
petitioner
has
relied
on
is
a
missing
or
and
this
overlapping
or
redundant
reference
to
attorney.
but
it's
critical
to
understand
that
nothing
about
the
missing
or
or
the
reference
to
attorney
in
(a)(1)(a)
affects
the
substantive
meaning
of
the
statute
or
in
any
way
prohibits
the
court
from
applying
the
literal
language
of
the
code
or
requires
the
code
to
do...
requires
the
court
to
do
something
the
code
prohibits.
by
contrast,
what
petitioner
is
seeking
is
a
substantive
enlargement,
and
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
there
is
no
case
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
where
the
court
has
added
back
language
in
a
statute
and
where...
in
a
substantive
way
that
congress
has
specifically
taken
out
when
there's
no
language
that
will
bear
that
interpretation.
if
there--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--sure.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
this
is
the
reference
to
attorney,
the
reference
to
attorney
in
(a)(1)(a).
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
your
honor,
it's...
the...
the
short
answer
it's...
it's
in
the
wrong
place.
the
critical
operative
list
that
provides
the
type
of
people
who
can
receive
compensation
is
in
(a)(1),
and
the
reference
to
attorney
just
describes
the
type
of
compensable
services,
which
also
includes
paralegals,
para-professionals.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
oh,
i'm...
329.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
collier
is
just
wrong.
the
provision
is--
[laughter]
--on
this
point...
is
that
it
operates
independently
and
requires
a
disclosure
of
all
fee
agreements
whether
or
not
there's
compensation,
and
maybe
another
way
of
putting
it
is
is
whether
or
not
the
court
rewrites
the
code,
329
is
going
to
apply
as...
as
it
always
has
and
require
a
disclosure
of...
of
pre-petition
fees.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
by
both
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
district
court
because
they
proceeded
on
the
erroneous
assumption,
as
found
by
the
fourth
circuit,
that
this
was
money
that
belonged
to
the
lawyer
instead
of
the
estate.
and
if
it
had
been...
and
this
was
an
11
case.
you
don't
see
in
chapter
7
large
pre-petition
retainers
like
this
because
the
chapter
11
usually
contemplates
ongoing
work
after
bankruptcy.
but
in
this
case,
they
did
what
most
lawyers
do,
is
put
the
money
in
the
trust
account,
and
it
wasn't
earned...
it
wasn't
earned
by
the
lawyer
until
the
services
were
performed.
but
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
trial
court
proceeded
on
the
assumption
the
money
belonged
to
the
lawyer,
and
so
if
the...
if
the
pre-petition
money
is
money
of
the
lawyers,
then
it's
reviewed
under
329.
but
then
the
fourth
circuit
said,
well,
no,
this
is
actually
money
of
the
estate
and
it
has
to
be...
it's
estate
funds.
those
are
held
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
and
there's
no
statutory
authority
to
use
estate
funds
to
pay
the
chapter
7
debtor's
attorney.
if
there
are
no
questions,
we'd
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
fourth
circuit's--
