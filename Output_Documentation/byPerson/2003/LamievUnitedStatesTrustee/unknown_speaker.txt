mr.
goldstein,
who's
covered
by
fees
available
for
a
professional
person
employed
under
section
327
or
1103?
unknown
speaker
but
not
chapter
7.
unknown
speaker
that's,
obviously,
of
critical
importance.
one
piece
of
background
information
please.
could
the
chapter
11
court
have
authorized
the
debtor's
attorney
to
do
this
work?
i
mean,
how
does
that
work?
i...
and
i...
i
do
agree
that
the
chapter
7...
the...
the
debtor's
attorney
really
is
often
required
to
do
some
very
important
things
to
get
the
chapter
7
filed.
but
if
the...
if
it's
an
11
first,
as
this
one
was,
could
the
chapter
11
court
have
authorized
the
work
to
be
done?
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
tell
the
court
in
the
chapter
11
proceeding,
we're
going
to
go
to
7
and
we
need
the
debtor
to
do
some
work,
the...
the
court
just
has
no
power
to
authorize
that
work
i
guess
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
can't
the...
i
mean,
their
argument
is
the
trustee
can
do
it.
the
trustee's
object
is
the
maximize
the...
the
value
for
the
estate
and
so
on,
and...
and
therefore
there's
no
built-in
conflict
there.
why
isn't
that
a
way
out
of
this
drafting
mess?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
is
there
any
conflict
in
the
trustee
saying,
look,
you
can
do
these
things
for
the
debtor
and
i'll
pay
you?
unknown
speaker
maybe...
not
to...
not
to
be
cute
about
it,
but
maybe
those
are
the
only
times
he
should
have.
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
any
conflict...
any
conflict
of...
of...
you
know,
ethical
or
quasi-ethical
conflict
if
the...
if
the
trustee
says,
look,
these
responsibility...
you've
got
to
shoulder
these
responsibilities.
it's
very
difficult
for
somebody
who's
not
a
lawyer
to
do
it.
okay,
i...
i
will
employ
a
lawyer
to
help
you.
is
there...
is
there
any
conflict
between
the
trustee
and
the
lawyer
there?
unknown
speaker
would
you
give
me...
just
give
me
an
example,
a
garden
variety
example--
unknown
speaker
--of
a
conflict
situation?
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do,
mr.
goldstein,
is
it
true
that
in
most
chapter
7's,
this
is
an
academic
question
because
there's
not
any
money
to
pay
even
the...
any...
the
administrative
creditors?
unknown
speaker
these
end
up
as
chapter
7
cases?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldstein,
you
know,
congress
had
this
problem
brought
to
its
attention
a
number
of
times
and...
and
has
chosen
not
to
enact
something,
putting
that
language
back
in.
that
i
find
somewhat
persuasive.
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
to
the
intent
of
congress,
i'm
rather
stuck
with
the
language.
i
mean,
what
we'd
have
to
do,
in
order
to
come
out
your
way,
is
to
read
the
words,
the
court
may
award
to
a
trustee,
an
examiner,
a
professional
person
employed
under
327
or
1103,
and
the
lawyer.
is
there
one
case
that
you've
found...
i'm
sure
you've
looked
because
you're
very
thorough...
in
the
history
of
the
world--
[laughter]
--where...
i
couldn't
find
any,
but
i
don't
know
all
the
cases
in
the
history
of
the
world...
where...
where,
in
fact,
a
court,
when
faced
with
a
definite
list
like
this
and
unable
to
say,
and
other
such
persons
or...
fool
with
the
language.
maybe
you'll
think
of
some
way
of
doing
it...
where
a
court
is
simply
stuck
in
words
of
insignificance
that
weren't
there
because
they
thought
the
legislature
had
made
a
mistake.
can
you
give
me
a
list
of
the
most
relevant
such
cases,
if
there
are
such?
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
not
adverting
to
any
canon.
unknown
speaker
i
am
adverting
to
the
fact
that
the
words
aren't
there.
unknown
speaker
no.
all
i
want
is
the
name
of
a
case
where
a
court--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
this
just
got
lost
in
the
shuffle?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
a
question
that
i
hope--
unknown
speaker
--you'll
be
allowed
to
answer--
[laughter]
--about
what
about
congress'
opportunity
to
correct
it--
unknown
speaker
--which
they
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
there
a
current...
isn't
there
a
current
correction...
bankruptcy
technical
correction
bill
pending,
and
isn't
this
absent
from
it?
unknown
speaker
but
now
it
has
been
called
to
their
attention
and
it
isn't
in
the
bill
making
other
technical
corrections.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
goldstein,
you're
overlooking
one...
one
other
argument
i
think.
before
this
statute
was
enacted,
the
association
of
bankruptcy...
whatever
the
name
of
it
is...
called
their
attention
to
this
drafting
error
and
said
we
think
it's
a
drafting
error.
unknown
speaker
and
nothing
was
done.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
add
one
thought.
they
said
this
appears
to
have
been
some
minor
drafting
errors,
including
the
apparently
inadvertent
removal
of
debtors'
attorneys
from
the
list
of
professionals
whose
compensation
awards
are
covered
by
330(a).
nacba
does
not
oppose
this
provision
since
it
contains
language
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
so
they...
it's...
one
can
read
that
as
saying
even
with
the
error,
we
don't...
we
don't
oppose
the
provision.
right.
we
actually...
that
reference,
we
do
not
oppose
this
provision,
we
believe,
in
the
context
of
those
remarks,
could
be
referring
to
the
addition
of
section
(a)(4)(b).
congress
in
1994
added
a
provision
that's
much
debated
in
the
briefs
about
chapter
12
and
13
bankruptcies.
remember,
this
is
the
national
association
of
consumer
bankruptcy
attorneys,
and
what
they
were
not
objecting
to
is
the
addition
of
a
provision
that
relates
to
consumer
bankruptcies.
but
let's
be
perfectly
clear.
the...
the
united
states
has
scoured
the
legislative
record
of
this
change
and
has
found
one
sentence
in
one
house
hearing,
and
it
says
that
it
was
a
mistake.
the
principle
in
bankruptcy
is
if
there's
a
statutory
change
and
it's
not
clear
on
the
text
or
at
least
in
the
legislative
history,
it's
presumed
not
to
change--
--but
isn't...
isn't
it
possible
also
to
read
this
as
saying,
yes,
you
made
a
mistake,
but
even
so,
it's
still
a
good
bill
and
we
think
even
with
the
mistake,
we're
in
favor
of
it,
and
then...
and
then
congress
looks
at
it
and
says,
yes,
we
did
make
a
mistake,
but...
but
the...
our...
we'll
stick
to
that
decision
because
the
united
states'
position
now
is
that
that's
a
wise...
the
provision
is
a
wise
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
the
standards
for
changing
bankruptcy
policy
in
congress
different
from
the
standards
of
changing
other
kinds
of
policy?
unknown
speaker
and
what...
what
precedents
are
those?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
some
of
the...
the
midatlantic,
for
example,
was
shortly
after
the
bankruptcy
code
was
adopted
succeeding
the
1898
act,
and
there,
there
was
probably
a
good
reason
for
saying
when
you
have
that
sort
of
a
comprehensive
revision,
the
presumption
is
that
if
something...
it's
not
clear
where
something
was
changed,
we
meant
to
retain
the
old.
but
this
wasn't
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
at
some
point,
will
you
go
back
to
my
first
question?
unknown
speaker
i
just...
you
have
just
a
few--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
why...
because
i
looked
at
united
states
v.
wilson.
it
doesn't
seem
like
this
at
all.
the
statute
said
there
said
a
defendant
shall
be
given
credit
towards
his
sentence
for
time
previously
spent
in
prison.
it's
in
the
passive
voice.
it
doesn't
say
whether
it
shall
be
given
credit
by
the
ag
or
also
by
a
district
court.
well,
obviously,
you
could
read
the
language
either
way.
what
i'm
having
problems
here
with
is
that
i
don't
see
any
way
to
read
this
language
so
that
it
comes
out
with
your
favor
without
putting
in
three
words
that
aren't
there.
and
i
haven't
heard
from
justinian...
the
time
of
justinian,
a
court
ever
having
done
that,
and
if
there
is
a
court
that
did
it,
it
wasn't
wilson.
unknown
speaker
you
can
have--
unknown
speaker
--inserted
the
word
what?
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
you're
not
missing...
you're
missing
my
point.
there
are
millions
of
ways--
unknown
speaker
--to
read
language
in
a
statute--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
it
has
a
limited
scope
or
a
scope
over
here
or
only
applies
there.
that's
so
common
every
day
of
the
week,
and
very
often
i
look
at
the
policy
and
i
see
if
the
statute
is
possibly
construed
in
that
way
through
that
kind
of
limitation.
what
i've
never
seen
is
a
statute
which
you
just
can't
word
by...
read
by
limiting
the
scope
or
saying
other
things
like
this,
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
i've
never
seen
a
court
just
take
three
words
out
of
the
blue
and
insert
them
in
that
way
in
a
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
don't
have
to
read
it
out.
they
just
say
the
word
is
superfluous.
there's...
there's
no
explanation
for
why
it's
there.
but,
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
statutes
that
have
superfluous
words,
and
that
does
a
lot
less
violence
certainly
to
the
statute
to
leave
in
a
word
that
doesn't
have
to
be
there
than...
than
to
insert
a
phrase,
which
is
what
you're
asking
us
to
do.
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
just
say
the
first
correction,
which
is...
or
the
first,
in...
in
your
view,
slip
is
the
elimination
of
four
words?
that's
really
what
they
wanted
to
do
because
that's
the
lead
provision,
and
then
in
the
subsidiary
provision,
there's
only
one
word
that
they
left
in.
so
if
you...
just
looking
at
the
statute,
i
assume
you
would
say
the
lead
provision
is
the
main
one
and
the
other,
the
subsidiary
provision,
four
words
in
one
case,
one
word
in
the
other.
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
umpteen
illustrations
of
missing
or's.
i
mean,
we
really
can't
put
much
weight
on
that.
unknown
speaker
but
how
can
you
say
that
if
this
material
i
called
to
your
attention
was
called
to
the
attention
at
least
of
the
staff
of
the
committee?
surely
the
staff
would
have
recognized
that
because
i
presume
they
read
it,
and
presumably
they
would
have
discussed
it
with
the
congressmen
and
said,
do
you
think
we
ought
to
make
a
change,
and
somebody
said
no.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
get
one
other
thought
out?
what
is
the
parallel
provision
that
you
say
remains
in?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
couldn't
that
refer
to
an
attorney
appointed
by
the
trustee?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it...
not...
the...
the...
there's
another
possibility:
any
attorney
employed
by
the
trustee.
and
that's
not
surplusage.
you
have
given
me
a
reason
why
there
may
be
a
conflict
involved
if
the
trustee
does
employ
an
attorney
for
the
debtor,
but
whatever
it
is,
it's
not
surplusage.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
if
the
trustee
appoints
an
attorney
not
for
himself,
but
for
the
debtor--
unknown
speaker
--then
it's
not
surplusage.
unknown
speaker
i...
let
me...
let's
assume
i
misspoke.
the
trustee
may
very
well
be
empowered
to
pay
the
person
employed
by
the
debtor.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
way
of
reading
these
two
sections
together.
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
expect
that
answer.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
goldstein.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
it
eliminated
them
unambiguously
i
guess
from
the
class
of
persons
entitled
to
be
paid
directly,
but
did
it
eliminate
them
from
the
class
of
persons
who
might
ultimately
be
compensated,
i.e.,
the
class
in...
in...
what
is
it?
subsection
(a).
unknown
speaker
so...
so
the...
so
the
reference
is
surplusage
in
(a).
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
the
word
attorney
in
330
would
then
have
a
different
meaning
after
the
amendment
than
it
had
before
because
before
the
amendment,
it
clearly
referred
to
the
debtor's
attorney,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
arguing
the
word
attorney
means
the
same
thing
it
always
meant.
in
other
words,
in
330.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
it
means
something
different.
unknown
speaker
why
does
it
make
any
sense,
considering
that
the
code
does
give
obligations,
duties
that
must
be
done
by
the
chapter
7
debtor?
and
some
of
them
are
pretty
complex.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
why
doesn't
that
help
the
petitioner?
as
justice
ginsburg
is
indicating,
before
the
petition
is
filed,
a
chapter
7
debtor
has
to
comply
with
some
rather
complex
forms,
plus
be
advised
of...
of
his
duties
and
liabilities.
don't
take
assets
out
the
back
door
and
so
forth.
so
there's
a
chronological
problem
here
that...
the...
the
trustee
can't
appoint
the
attorney
until
the
proceeding
is
filed,
but
the
attorney
is
really
required
to
do
some
advance
work.
unknown
speaker
and
that
can
be
paid.
unknown
speaker
that
is
paid
the
lawyer--
--is
it
established
that's
not
avoidable
preference?
unknown
speaker
for
current
services?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
avoidable
preference
if
it's
too
high,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the...
what
if
the
check
bounced
and
there's
now
been
a
conversion
to
7
and
the...
and
the
lawyer
says,
i
ought
to
be
paid
for
my
11
work?
on
your
theory,
does
he
get
paid?
unknown
speaker
he
clears
the
check.
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
at
this
point,
regardless
of
chapter
11
work,
chapter
7
work,
no
payment
out
of
the...
the
estate
funds.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
about--
unknown
speaker
--a
provision
of
the
statute
you
didn't
include
in
your
brief,
or
at
least
in
the
appendix.
section
329--
unknown
speaker
--specifically
authorizes
the
debtor's
attorney
to
receive
a
retainer,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
if
the
court
does
not
order
a
cancellation
of
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
provision
contemplates
a
payment
to
the
debtor's
attorney
for
his
services
to
the
debtor.
unknown
speaker
this
refers
to
7.
i
think
329
applies
to
chapter
7
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
section
(b),
it
authorizes
the
court
to
cancel
it...
cancel
the
agreement
if
it's
unreasonable
compensation.
so
it
seems
to
me
it
applies
that
if
the
compensation
was
reasonable,
they
could
approve
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand,
but
the
money
has
to
be
paid
pre-petition.
here,
of
course,
it
was,
but
he
kept
it
in
escrow
instead
of
putting
it
in
his
pocket.
unknown
speaker
but
not
that
would
assist
the
debtor
in
the
exemption
example.
unknown
speaker
i
really
don't
understand
that
argument
because
this
case
just
involves
the
other
4
percent,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
in
the
4
percent,
aren't
there?
several
thousand.
unknown
speaker
so
what
difference
does
it
make
that
96
percent...
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
has
retained
counsel
to
do
work
to
benefit
the
estate,
not
retained
counsel
to
represent
the
debtor.
unknown
speaker
which
he
could
have
done
before
1996.
unknown
speaker
not
if
he's
a
company,
as
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
didn't
have
ample
authority
to
do
it
before
the
chapter
7
was
filed,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
i
thought
you
indicated
that
the
trustee
had
ample
authority
to
hire
the
debtor's
attorney,
and
i...
in
the
chapter
7
proceeding,
and
i
said,
true,
but
does
he
have
the
authority
to
hire
the
debtor's
attorney
before
the
chapter
7
is
filed?
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
he
doesn't
have
that
authority.
unknown
speaker
for
work
done
from
that
time
forward.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
trustee
until
chapter
7,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
and
he
can
hire
the...
and
he
can
hire
the
debtor's
attorney
to
do
work
in
the
chapter
7,
but
that
doesn't
compensate
for
what...
the
work
that
was
done
before
chapter
7.
unknown
speaker
the
work
that
was
done
before
chapter
7
was
compensated
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
are
all
trustees
in
chapter
7
cases
united
states
trustees?
they're
not,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
government
isn't
involved
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
the
bankruptcy
judge
appoints
the
trustee.
unknown
speaker
does
the
bankruptcy
court
appoint
a
u.s.
trustee
in
every
single
case?
unknown
speaker
they...
they
do
that
without
any
appointment
by
the
bankruptcy
court
then
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
through,
let
me
just--
unknown
speaker
--maybe
this
is
a
little
repetitious,
but
i
want
to
read
you
two
sentences
from
collier
on
bankruptcy,
the
treatise
that
most
of
us
rely
on
perhaps
too
much
in
this
area.
after
describing
the
government's
position
in
this,
it
would
represent
a
fundamental
change
in
the
law.
the
treatise
goes
on.
section
329
of
the
code
permits
the
debtor's
attorney
to
receive
a
reasonable
retainer
for
services
rendered
in
contemplation
of
or
to
be
rendered
in
connection
with
a
case
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
such
a
provision
would
be
superfluous
if
the
deletion
in
section
330(a)
is
construed
as
excepting
debtor's
counsel
from
compensation
under
section
330.
what's
your
response
to
that
again?
you've
partly
responded,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
you
cover
it
all.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no.
they...
they
rely
on
section
329,
which
talks
about--
unknown
speaker
--that
that's...
they
say
section
329
permits
all
this,
and
they
say
that
provision
would
be
superfluous
if
your
reading
of
330(a)
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the...
the
fees
that
were
attributed
to
the
chapter
11
phase,
when
approval
was
sought,
wasn't
that
under
329
when...
there...
there
was
the...
the
lump
sum
$6,000,
and
something
over
$1,000
was
attributed
to
the
pre-petition
chapter
11
time.
wasn't
the
approval
of
that
under
this
section
329?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but
can't
that
be
checked
by
the
court
under
329
and
say
that's
too
much?
