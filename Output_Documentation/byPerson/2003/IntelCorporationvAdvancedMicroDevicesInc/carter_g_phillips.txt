mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
kennedy,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
court
of
first
instance
does
not
have
the
authority
to
order
discovery.
but
justice
ginsburg,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
court
of
first
instance
does
have
the
authority
to
say,
in
response
to
an
argument
made
by
amd,
that
we
have
not
adequately
explained
why
we
didn't
take
that
information
into
account.
and
we
know
from
the
briefs
that
amd
has
a
pretty
good
idea
what
that
information
entails
and
therefore
would
be
in
a
perfectly
adequate
position
to
go
first,
obviously,
to
the
commission
and
say
this
is
why
we
want
you
to
consider
this
information.
and
then
second,
in
the
event
that
we
were
to
issue
a
refusal
to
go
forward
with
the
proceeding,
which
we
have
to
explain,
frankly,
in
quite
excruciating
detail,
that's
then
subject
to
very
much
plenary
review
by
the
court
of
first
instance
and
ultimately
the
court
of
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
the
court
of
first
instance
does
not
expand
the
record.
it,
like
our
federal
courts
reviewing
agency
decision-making,
has
the
authority
to
send
the
matter
back
to
the
agency
to
review
the
question
a
second
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
commission
has
not
made
a
preliminary
determination.
i
think
it's
important
to
put
it
in
context.
this
is
a...
an
abuse
of
monopoly
power
claim
based
on
a
large
number
of
contracting
arrangements
between
intel
and
a
lot
of
its
customers.
and
the
question...
and
so
there's
a
serious
question
of
having
to
review
a
lot
of
market
data
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
appears
to
be
a
pattern
of
abuse
or
a
problem
that's
worthy
of
going
forward
with.
so
the
commission
has
for
some
time
been
taking
a
very
hard
look
at
the
nature
of
the
market,
has
obviously
talked
to
amd,
has
talked
to
intel.
i
think
that's
an
important
aspect
of
this
case
that
the
court
ought
to
have
in
mind,
is
that...
and...
and
it's
part
of
the
comity
concerns
that
i
think
ought
to
animate
the
court's
analysis
of
this
problem.
the
commission
has
an
orderly
process
and
that
process
may,
at
some
day,
require
it
to
ask
intel
to
provide
these
particular
documents
or
other
documents.
we
don't
know.
but
what
we
don't
want
frankly
is
for
a
private
entity
to
run
to
a
united
states
court
and
use
essentially
the
commission
as
a
pawn
in
an
effort
to
obtain
pre-complaint
discovery.
that's
pre-complaint
both
pre
in
the
united
states
complaint
and
pre-complaint
in
the...
before
the
european
commission.
if
at
some
point
in
the
future
we
need
assistance,
we
know
how
to
obtain
that
assistance
on
our
own.
we
don't
require,
quote,
interested
parties
to
do
so.
in
our...
in
our
assessment
of
the
case
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we...
we--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--let
me
give
you
a
preliminary
answer
and
then
i'll
tell
you...
the...
the
real
answer
as
how...
we
would
interpret
it
through
the
word
tribunal.
that's
the
statutory
hook
that
the
commission
feels
most
comfortable
with.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure,
justice
breyer.
but
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
was
based
on
an
assessment
that
the
preliminary
actions
taken
by
the
commission
in
this
particular
case
are
such
that
render
us
a
tribunal
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
which
was
the
explicit
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
this
information
to
be
evaluated
at
least
on
remand
by
the
district
court.
and...
and
our
position
is,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
this
court
is
going
to
adopt
an...
an
approach
akin
to
that
by
judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit
opinion
involving
the
indian
tax
collectors,
which
looks
to
see
whether
or
not
the
adjudicative
function
is
distinct
from
the
investigative
functions,
our
answer
would
be
that
we
are
not
that
kind
of
a
tribunal.
we...
everything
we
do
is
investigative.
we
do
not
perform--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--they
make
that
argument,
but
that
would
be
an
alternative
theory.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the...
the
next
step,
obviously,
and
it's
not
one
that
the
commission
argues
for
specifically,
but
it's
one
that...
that
intel
makes,
which
is
that
even
if...
if
you're
going
to
use
the
court
as
the
ultimate
tribunal,
then
what
is
the
nexus
between
this
request
for
information
and
a
proceeding
before
that
court.
that's
so
far
off
into
the
future.
it
certainly
implicates
the
earlier
d.c.
circuit
opinion
by
justice
ginsburg,
et
cetera.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it
would
not
regard
itself
as
a
tribunal
under
those
circumstances.
if
we
wanted
these
documents,
we...
we
would
seek
them
either
directly
from
the
parties
or
through
some
other
mechanism.
this
is
not
a
mechanism
that
the...
that
the
commission
itself
views
as
available
to
it
to
seek
documents.
we
would
go
through
government
officials.
we
would
go
to
the
ftc.
we
would
go
to
the
department
of
justice
to
seek
information.
we
might
go
to
our...
our
member
countries
to
seek
information,
or
we
would
go
to
parties
over
whom
we
have
direct
jurisdiction
to
seek
information.
but
1782
is
not
a
provision
that
the
commission
views
itself
as...
views
as
available
to
it,
nor
does
it
want
to
be
used
as
a
pawn
by...
by
private
entities
seeking
to
employ
its
processes
as
a
mechanism
to
obtain
pre-trial...
pre-complaint
discovery
that's
available
under
no
other
circumstances.
the...
the
over-arching
argument
that
the
commission
would
like
the...
the
court
to
take
away
from
this
is...
is
a
question
of
if
you
have
to
decide
on
a
contextual
basis,
because
the
language
of
the
statute
is
not
unambiguous
and
therefore
you
have
to
come
up
with
some
limiting
principles,
the
commission
urges
the
court
to
recognize
that
the
use
of
discovery
in
this...
the
use
of
this
statute
in
this
particular
way
is
a
direct
interference.
it
risks
the
release
of
confidential
information.
it
increases
the
burden
on
the
commission
and
the
workload
that
it
has,
and
it
allows
us
to
unseemingly...
unseemingly
being
used...
unseemly
being
used
as
a
pawn
in
this
kind
of...
in
this
kind
of
an
effort
at
discovery.
and
we
would
ask--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it...
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
that
sense
and
it
also
provides
an
incentive.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it...
it
provides
an
incentive
for
more
filings
with
the
commission
in
order
to
use
this
device
in
order
to
obtain
discovery
that
you
otherwise
could
not
get.
and
i
think
there's
good
reason
to
suspect
that
it
may
be
used.
certainly
if
this
court
were
to
uphold
what
amd
attempted
to
accomplish
here,
i
would
be
quite
worried
about
other
plaintiffs
in
future
cases
using
this
particular
device.
and
remember,
there
are
no
rule
11
sanctions
that
are
available
for
a
filing
with
the
european
commission.
you
don't
have
to
be
a
lawyer
to
file
a
complaint
with
the
european
commission.
it
requires
a
relatively
minimal
amount
of
effort.
it's
a
letter
that
identifies
a
particular
problem
and
asks
the
commission
then
to
go
forward
and
take
a
look
at
it.
therefore,
it's
a...
it's
essentially
a
costless
exercise
by
plaintiffs
using
the
commission,
i
submit,
in
a
way
that
i
would
hope
the
court
would
find
inappropriate
and
therefore
ought
to
resolve
the
ambiguities,
whether
you
do
it
on
the
basis
of
tribunal
or
for
use
of
or
proceeding...
and
the
commission
would
not
presume
to
tell
this
court
how
to
interpret
the
language
of
its
statute,
but
whatever
choice
you
make,
whichever
statutory
hook
you
look
for,
the
commission
would
ask
that
this
court
interpret
the
statute
narrowly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
well,
the
commission
is
certainly
supportive
of
that
notion
because
the
commission
believes
that
when
and
if
it
needs
these...
this
information,
it
will
be
able
to
obtain
it
directly
from
the
party.
that
is
the
easiest
undertaking
in
order
to
obtain
information
that
the
commission
has
available
to
it.
so
to
the
extent
the
court
wants
to
draw
that
line,
certainly
the
commission
would
be
quite
comfortable
with
that
line.
again,
of
course,
the
commission
is
uncomfortable
telling
you
how
to
decide
the
case...
the
statutory...
the
specific
statutory
language.
let
me
just...
one
last
point.
the
last
thing
in
the
world
the
commission
really
wants
is
to
have
800
district
courts
deciding
this
issue
on
a
case-by-case
basis
exercising
their
discretion.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
an
intolerable
burden
to
impose
on
the
commission.
it
cannot
monitor
all
litigation
in
the
united
states
in
order
to
make
its
interests
and
concerns
known.
and,
therefore,
it
is
terribly
important
that
this
court
announce
a
rule,
either
as
a
supervisory
matter
or
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
that
will
limit
the
ability
of
the
commission
to
be
used,
as
i
say,
as
a
pawn
in
this
discovery
effort.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
geez.
i
don't...
off
the
top
of
my
head...
i
mean,
the
commission
didn't
examine
it...
that
particular
issue
specifically,
justice
kennedy.
i'm...
i'm
hoping
that
my
colleague
in
rebuttal
will
be
able
to
give--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the...
the
comity
principle
are
the
cases
like
m'culloch
and
the...
and
the...
that
we
cited
in
the
brief,
and
obviously
charming
betsy.
i
mean,
those
are
rules
of
interpretation
that
we
have,
but
that's
not...
that
doesn't
answer
justice
kennedy's
specific
question.
