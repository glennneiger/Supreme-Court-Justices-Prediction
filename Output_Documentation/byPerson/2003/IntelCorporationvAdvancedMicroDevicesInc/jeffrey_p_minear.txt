mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
yes,
we
would
agree
with
the
position
that
an
interested
party
does
need
to
have
a
pending
proceeding.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
i
can
go
back
and...
and
try
and
clarify
my
answer.
there's
two
questions
here
really.
first
of
all,
is
there
a
proceeding
in
which...
before
a
foreign
tribunal,
and
is
there
an
interested
person?
in
our
view,
a
private
person
becomes
an
interested
person
when
there
is
a
proceeding
that
is
going
forward.
the...
in
the
case
of
the
tribunal
itself,
it
can,
under
section
1782,
request
this
information
even
though
no
complaint
has
yet
been
filed
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
way
that
we
ensure
that
there
are
not
actions
brought
by
people
who
have
not
taken
any
action
but
are
simply
seeking
discovery
without
any
proceeding
being
present.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that...
that's
correct.
and
i'd
like
to
make
three
basic
points.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
we
think
it...
it
is
and
we
can
point
to
several
reasons
why
that
is
the
case.
first
of
all,
a
textual
reason,
that
the
statute
itself,
section
1782,
makes
reference
to
proceedings
before
a
foreign
tribunal,
including
criminal
investigations
before
formal
accusations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
think
part
of
the
confusion
here
is
the
procedures
that
are
actually
in
place
by
the
european
commission.
in
that
regard,
i
suggest
that
the
court
take
heed
of
the
notice
concerning
the
filing
of
complaints
that's
cited
on
page
13
in
note
3
of
amd's
brief.
that's
an
80-paragraph
document
that
describes
the
procedures
that
the
european
commission
follows--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--perhaps,
but
i
would
point
out
the
similarities
to
an
adjudication
before
i...
i
move
on
to
answer
that
question.
first
of
all,
a
party
that
files
a
complaint
does
not
simply
send
a
letter
in.
instead,
they
must
use
the
complaint
form
that's
described.
they
must
set
forth
all
of
the
information
that
they
have
available,
and
they
must
establish
that
they
are
an
interested
party.
a
legitimate
party
i
think
is
the
term
that's
used,
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
a
standing
requirement.
there's
then
proceedings
in
which
they
participate
before
the
european
commission,
ultimately
leading
to
the
commission
issuing
a
letter
indicating
a
preliminary
decision.
they're
allowed
to
respond
to
that
as
well.
and
at
that
point,
the
commission
then
must
make
a
choice.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
primarily
by
submitting
written
documents,
by
responding
in
written
form.
it's
my
understanding
there
is
no
hearing
before
the
commission
in
that
first
stage,
but
ultimately
there
is
a
decision
that's
produced
by
the
commission
that
is...
must
include
reasons
for
their
decision,
and
that
is
judicially
reviewable.
now,
that
entire
process
bespeaks,
to
a
considerable
extent,
of
an
adjudicative
type
proceeding.
but
even
if
it's
not,
it's
at
least
in
preparation
of
what
will
then
be
one
of
two
certainly
adjudicative
proceedings.
one
is
the
review
by
the
court
of
first
instance,
or
in
the
alternative,
if
the
commission
decides
to
go
forward
with
the
complaint,
a
proceeding
in
which
a
statement
of
objections
is
then
lodged
against
intel.
my
point
in
describing
all
this
is
just
to
emphasize
that
congress
used
very
broad
language
here
in
terms
of
a
proceeding
before
a
foreign
tribunal
because
it
realized
that
there's
a
vast
and
uncatalogued
variety--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
that's
a
question,
it
seems
to
me,
that
goes
to
the
district
court's
discretion,
determining
whether
or
not
to
allow
the
evidence.
that's
not
a
statutory
criteria
that
you're
citing
to,
but
rather
i
believe
that
the
d.c.
circ
was
indicating
a
matter
that
informs
the
discretion.
the
statute--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
district
court
has
to
make
that
judgment
of
whether
or
not
the
action--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
in
the
example
you
just
gave,
there's
been
a
complaint
that's
been
filed
and
one
of
two
things...
i
can
say
one
of
three
things
will
happen.
either
a
complaint
will
be
denied...
ultimately
will
be
denied,
in
which
case
there
will
be
an
action
before
the
court
of
first
instance,
or
else
there
will
be
the...
the
commission
will
go
forward
with
the
complaint,
in
which
case
there
will
certainly
be
an
adjudication
against
intel,
or
amd
would
withdraw
the
complaint
for
some
reason
that
we
don't
know
about.
those
are
the
only
three
alternatives.
so
certainly
under
the
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
i
think
that
a...
proceedings
are
in
reasonable
contemplation,
or
at
a
minimum,
at
least
that
issue
ought
to
be
placed
before
the
district
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
by
no
means
at
all,
your
honor.
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
we
believe
that
rules
of...
supervisory
rules
of
practice
can
be
developed
by
the
courts
to
contain
and
channel
the
district
court's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
authority
is
the
type
of
authority
that
is
described
in
thomas
v.
arn.
it's
simply
that
the
court
has...
has
authority
to
supervise
the
activity
and
provide
guidance
to
district
courts
in
the
exercise
of
their
discretion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
agree
with
that
as
well,
and
we
think
that
type
of
guidance
at
this
stage
would
be
premature.
we
suggested
the
court
take
this
case
to
resolve
the
circuit
conflict
on
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
the
district
courts
have
been
at
work
at
this
area
and
there
are
about
20
cases
now
over
the
past
40
years
in...
that
have
construed
section
1782,
and
they...
those
cases
do
provide
guidance.
we
think
that
the
question...
the
primary
question
this
court
needs
to
answer
is,
is
there
a
rule
of
foreign
discoverability?
and
we
submit
that
there's
no
such
rule
evident
on
the
basis
of
the
statute--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
we
need
to
pay
close
attention
to
what
the
commission
said
and
what
it
did
not
say.
our
view
is
if
the
commission
does
not
want
this
information,
then
that's
a
very
good
reason
for
the
district
court
to
deny
discovery
in
this
case.
the
court
has
not
said...
the
commission
has
not
said
it
would
not
use
this
information,
which
is
quite
a
different
matter.
if
the
commission
said
that
it
will
simply
not
use
this
information,
then
that
is
a
reason
why
section
1782
should
not
apply.
the
information
would
simply
not
be
used
in
the
proceeding.
but
we
think
that
the...
the
circumstances
here
are
far
less
certain.
i
should
point
out
that
this
matter
has
gone
back
down.
the
issue...
a
mandate
was
issued
while
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
pending.
and
the
magistrate
judge
has
issued
a
preliminary
order
that
the
district
court
has
not
reviewed
yet,
which
has
limited
the
amount
of
discovery
that
would
be
available.
and
in
that
course
of
that
decision,
the
magistrate
judge
did
point
out
that
it
was
not
clear
whether
this
information...
whether
the
commission
had
not
made
clear
whether
or
not
the
information
would
be
wanted
or
used
by
it.
that
was...
there
was
uncertainty--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
that
issue--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
think
you...
you
need
to
resolve
the
issue
of
statutory
construction
on
the
rule
of
the
question
of
foreign
discoverability.
and
we've
explained
our
views
in
the
brief
on
that.
