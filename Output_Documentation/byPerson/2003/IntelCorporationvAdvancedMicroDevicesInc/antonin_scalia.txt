mr.
waxman,
i...
i...
it
seems
to
make
a
lot
of
sense,
but
i
need
a...
i
need
a...
a
hook
to
hang
it
on.
i
need
some
language
in
that
text
which...
which
would
enable
me
to
say,
oh,
it
means
you
only
get
discovery
when
there
would
have
been
discovery
in
the
foreign
proceeding.
but
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
see
any
language
that
gets
me
anywhere
near
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
fall
back,
i
suppose,
on...
on
guided
discretion
until,
you
know,
we
can
tell
the
lower
courts
never
to
do
it
unless
its
available
in
foreign...
but
i
don't
see
it
in
the
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
i
am
looking
or
a
word
in
here
that...
that
similarly
requires
you
to
decide
whether
the
foreign
court
itself
would
allow
discovery.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is...
which
is
the...
the
major
point
you
were
addressing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
any...
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
explanation
for
elimination
of
the
word
pending
from
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
prosecutor
has
no
authority
on
his
own
to
impose
a
fine.
right?
he
can
just
bring
the
case
to
court,
and
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
commission
here
does
have
authority
on
its
own
to
take
action
against
a
party.
that...
now,
that
action
that
it
takes
will
be
reviewable,
but
it
can
impose
a
fine
or
require
the...
the
selling
of
some
of
the
assets
of
the
company
and
so
forth.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's--
--that's
different.
that's
different
from
what
a
prosecutor
can
do.
he
can't...
he
can't
do
anything
on
his
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't
want
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
don't
want
it.
they've
also
said
they
don't
want
it.
they
said,
if
you
give
it
to
us,
we'll
look
at
it,
we
have
to,
but
frankly,
we'd
rather
you
go
away.
isn't
that
what
they've
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
has
to
be
a
pending
proceeding,
you're
saying,
because
you
obviously
can't
be
a
party
if
there's
no
proceeding
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
then...
then
you're
saying
you
could
have
come
here
even
before
you
filed
the...
the
complaint
with
the
commission.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
do
that,
explain
what
you've
just...
what
you've
just
said.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
proceeding
before
a
tribunal
here
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
think
that...
that
the...
the
commission
is
a
tribunal
even
in
the
preliminary
stages
when
it's
investigating
and...
and
is...
has...
is
not
adjudicating?
