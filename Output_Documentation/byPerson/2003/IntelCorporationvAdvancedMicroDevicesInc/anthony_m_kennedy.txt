what
happens
when
amd
goes
to
the
court
of
first
instance,
disappointed
with
what
the
eu
commission
or
that
the
eu
committee
has
done,
and
then
it
goes
to
the
court
of
first
instance?
can
that
court
of
first
instance
in
its
discretion
order
any
discovery?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
sure
he'll...
i'm
sure
he'll
be
glad
you
asked
him
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's...
that's
why
i
asked
and
it
would
seem...
let's
assume
that
the
court
of
first
instance
could
order
and
in
the
usual
course
would
order
some
sort
of
discovery.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
court
of
first
instance
can't
expand
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what's
our
authority
to
announce
a
supervisory
rule?
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
they...
do
they--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--must
they
consider...
and
i...
i
think
this
is
along
the
lines
of
what
justice
souter
is
asking,
so
i
hope
i'm
not
interrupting.
must
they
consider
any
evidence
you
give
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
can
they
say
that
it's...
that...
that
there's
a...
certain
relevancy
rules
that...
that
you
must
adhere
to?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
what's
happening,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
you
want
to
force
them
to
consider
things
they
don't
want
to
consider.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
haven't
they,
in
effect,
said
that?
they
said,
please,
we
don't...
we
don't
want
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what's
our
authority
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's...
it's
an
odd
reading
of
the
statute
that
we
have
these
discoveries
for
use
in
a
proceeding
in
a
tribunal
and
the
tribunal
said
it
isn't
for
our
use.
it's
counterproductive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
can
that
be
for
use
if
it's
counterproductive?
