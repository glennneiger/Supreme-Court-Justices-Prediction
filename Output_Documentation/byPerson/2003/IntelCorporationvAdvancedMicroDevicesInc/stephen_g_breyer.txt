justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
the...
the
difficulty
is...
is,
well,
what
are
the
rules.
what
you
say
sounds
as
if
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense,
but
there
are
three
aspects
to
the
case.
starting
backwards
is,
can
a
private
party
bring
this?
the
answer
is
yes.
you
agree
it's
yes.
but
you
want
to
say
not
always.
so
then
you
have
a
rule
that
you've
just
enunciated
now
of
who
definitely
couldn't.
and
as
to
the
second,
i
guess...
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
right
rule,
frankly.
maybe
we'd
figure
that
out.
maybe
it
is.
the
second
part.
i
found
an
opinion
by
justice
ginsburg
where
she
has
a
rule
which
is
in
the
d.c.
circuit
which
says
about
how
close
it
has
to
be
in
time,
and
my
guess
is
that
you
will
say
that's
okay,
but
i'd
be
interested
if
you
don't.
and
as
to
the
first
part
about,
well,
yes,
we
agree
this
is
a
person
who
can
get
discovery,
but
not
here,
now,
there
i
don't
see
any
rule
at
all.
so
i'd
like
to
know
your
views
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
want
to
follow
their...
all
right.
so
my
two
questions
are,
is
justice
ginsburg's
approach
to
the
time
problem
okay
with
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that...
her
quote--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let
me...
i
better
quote
this.
it
says
you
have
to
have
to
get
this
discovery
reliable
indications
of
the
likelihood
that
proceedings
will
be
instituted
within
a
reasonable
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
might
win
under
that
for
the
very
reason
you
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
that
fit
in
the
rule
then?
i
mean,
what
kind
of...
what
kind
of
a
rule
of
law
is
it?
i
mean,
what
do
you...
how
do
you
fit
that
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
say
if
the
commission
doesn't
want
it,
then
don't
give
it
to
them,
but
if
they
do
want
it,
do?
how
does
this
fit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
interpret
the
statute
to
get
the
result
that
you're
arguing
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
with
a
tribunal
you...
i
don't
think
it
is
a
tribunal
probably,
but
i'll
hear
more
on
the
other
side.
but
still,
there
is
a
tribunal
in
the
offing
and
that's
the
tribunal
that
will
be
there
if
the
commission
decides
to
enforce
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
do
it,
but
they
have...
i
think
they
have
the
alternative
ground
here,
that
even
if
you're
not
a
tribunal,
the
ninth
circuit
says
it
could
lead
to
a
proceeding
in
the
court
of
first
instance.
don't
they
say
that
somewhere
in
their
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
as
long
as
they
make
that
argument,
then
i
can't
say,
okay,
i've
got
the
result
there
that...
that
they're
arguing
for,
assuming
you're
right,
that...
that
just
by
using
this
thing
about
the
tribunal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
so...
so
what
else
could
we
use
to
get
to
your
desired
end
with
this
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
interpretation
of
what
comity
consists
of
in
this
instance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
israel,
for
example,
if
you
have
a...
a
criminal
prosecutor,
it
looks
just
like
our
prosecutor.
my
understanding
is
that
the
one
difference
is
that
a
victim
could
go
to
court
to
force
the
prosecutor
to
bring
a
prosecution.
so
does
that
mean
now
under
this
statute,
because
of
that
one
difference,
all
prosecutors
in
israel
are
open
to
this...
our
tribunals
under
this
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
not...
that's
not
the
part
i'm
getting
at.
i
am
saying
it's
easy
to
think
of
people
whom,
when
we
look
at
them,
they
are
precisely
like
a
human
being
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
office,
and
everything
they
do
every
day
is
just
like
a
u.s.
attorney,
but
for
one
thing,
that
somebody
who
wants
a
prosecution
to
be
brought
can
get
a
court
to
review
a
decision,
no
prosecution.
now,
i'm
asking
you
if
that
single
difference
is
sufficient
to
translate
this
into
a
tribunal
under
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
now,
you're
not
getting
my
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
just
repeat
it
again.
did
you
not
understand
the
question?
the
question
is
i'm
imaging
a
person
like
a
u.s.
attorney,
exactly
the
same,
and
there's
only
the
one
difference
i
mentioned.
somebody
can
go
ask
a
judge
to
say
did
he
abuse
his
discretion
in
not
bringing
this
rico
case.
okay?
that's
the
only
difference.
now,
i'm
asking
you
if
we
had
such
a
person,
does
that
make
him
a
tribunal
under
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
that's
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
agree
with
you...
how
does
this
particular
tribunal
differ
from
the
one
i
just
described?
i
don't
mean
a
tribunal.
how
does
the
commission
differ
from
that
prosecutor
i
just
described?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
forget
israel.
i
might
even
be
wrong
about
israel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
got
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
want
to
know
how
they
differ
from
what
i
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
differs
from
my
case,
which
was
our
u.s.
attorney
who
can
be
brought
to
court
for
not
prosecuting
on
those
kinds
of
grounds.
you
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
him,
and
now
you're
more
or
less
repeating
what
i
said
was
the
special
feature
of
my
imaginary
u.s.
attorney.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is...
you
can
elaborate
on
that
or
give
me
another
one
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
very
important.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
is
the
difference
there
between...
and
i...
i'm
serious
about
this
question.
what
is
the...
what...
all
my
questions
are
serious.
but
this
is...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this.
what
is
the
difference
specifically
between
the
eu
saying
you
pay
$10
million
and
the
u.s.
attorney
saying
we
want
him
to
pay
$10
million?
what's
the
difference
there
procedurally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
they
review
it,
do
they
give
a
leg
up
to
the
commission?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
goes
to
court,
is
the...
is
the
issue
in
the
court
in
the
eu
an
issue
like
review
of
the
nlrb,
that
the
nlrb
wins,
unless
they're
quite
wrong,
or
is
it
like
a
court
reviewing
a
decision
of
the
antitrust
division
to
bring
a
tying
case
where
the
court
will
say,
we'll
make
up
our
mind
on
our
own?
you
know,
they
know
something
about
it,
so
do
we.
which
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
to
be
either
one
or
the
other.
they...
they
either
have
to
give
deference
to
the
agency,
as
we
did,
or
they're
making
this
decision
on
their
own.
and
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
about
fact-finding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
process.
i'm
saying
does
the
reviewing
court
defer
to
the
commission's
finding
of
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
impression,
which
only
comes
from
the
newspapers,
is
that
the
courts
there
are
taking
a
much
more
active
role
and
it's
becoming
like
they're
vis-a-vis
the
antitrust
division
and
it's
not
like
vis-a-vis
a
commission.
but
is
that...
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
wrong
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's...
that's...
there
are
criminal
investigations
in
most
countries
other
than
britain
and
the
united
states
where
the
investigating
magistrate
is
a
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
they're
a
tribunal.
the
key
things
here
is
that
the
people
here
are
investigators
who
do
not
think
of
themselves
as
judges.
they
are
not
judges.
and
in
addition,
the
proceedings
are
not
adversarial,
nor
are
they
adjudicative
in
any
sense.
and
that
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between...
you're
talking...
you
think
you
could
bring
a...
all
we
have
is
an
investigation
in
france
by
the
police
judiciaire.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
suddenly
we're
going
to...
we're
going
to
start
getting
all...
i
mean,
no.
it's
a
big
difference
whether
it's
a
magistrate,
a...
you
know,
a
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
read
through
some,
my
clerk
read
through
some,
and
i
ended
up
by
thinking
there
are
some
that
are
rather
like
the
ftc,
but
then
there
are
a
certain
number
that
are
really
very
different.
and
the
thing
that
struck
me
as
pretty
critical
is
just
what
i
said.
they
do
not
think
of
themselves
as
judges.
they
are...
do
not
think
of
what
they
are
doing
as
adjudicatory,
and
they
don't
even
have
a
way
of
walling
off,
as
we
do,
the
investigators
from
the
adjudicators.
now,
there
are
certain
similarities
too.
but
where
we
have
similarities
and
major
differences,
maybe
we
should
pay
attention
to
what
they
want
to
call
themselves.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
sort
of
sloughed
over
a
point
i
think
was
pretty
critical.
i
mean,
if
the
commission
itself
is
not
proceeding...
not
a
tribunal,
which
i...
you
dispute,
but
if
i
were
to
disagree
with
you
about
that,
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
first
instance
and
the
further
reviewing
courts
are.
but
there
you
run
into
the
statement
in
that
d.c.
case
that
i
referred
to
earlier
which
there
must
be
reliable
indications
of
the
likelihood
the
proceedings
will
be
instituted
within
a
reasonable
time.
and
as
to
those
further
court
of
first
instance,
the
reviewing
court
and
over
in
the
ecj,
then...
then...
do
they
meet
that
criterion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
would
be
within
this
statute
even
if
the
only
indication
we
had
whichever...
there
would
ever
be
a
case
is
there's
1
chance
in
50
that
there
will
be
a
case
18
years
from
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
fall
within
this
statute
and
it's
just
some
kind
of
discretion
that
keeps
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
in
the
example
i
just
gave?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
want
800
judges
to
review
this
even
in
the
extreme
case
i
mentioned,
and
unless...
as
long
as
you
can
find
some
in
your
favor,
you
can
just
go
file
a
complaint
over
there
and
get
all
your
competitors'
documents
and
put
everybody
to
about
$5
million
or
$6
million
worth
of
costs,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
given
their
brief
in
this,
which
seems
to
me
could
not
be
more
clear--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
your
belief
that
looked
what
happened,
what
we
have
even
this
court
granting
some
discovery,
even
though
the
principle
is
they
shouldn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
what
are
we
supposed
to
write
that
makes
real
what
you--
