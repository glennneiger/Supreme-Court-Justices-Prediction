mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
28
u.s.c.,
section
1782
authorizes
discovery
for
use
in
a
proceeding
in
a
foreign
or
international
tribunal,
upon
application
by
an
interested
person.
those
are
words
of
indeterminate
scope.
no
one
in
this
case
contends
that
they
should
be
applied
to
the
limits
of
definitional
possibility,
that
words
like
interested
person,
for
use
in,
proceeding
require
a
contextual
interpretation,
and
the
context
in
this
case
is
comity
in
discovery.
as...
in
language
that
everyone
in
this
case
quotes,
the
1964
senate
report
characterized
the
statute
as
for
the
purpose
of,
quote,
adjusting
u.s.
procedures
to
the
requirements
of
foreign
practice
and
procedure.
and
with
respect
to
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
there
are
three
salient,
completely
undisputed
facts.
number
one,
ec
law
denies
an
antitrust
complainant
any
discovery
rights
for
anything
at
any
stage
of
the
proceeding
however
long
or
short
it
may
go.
number
two,
if
amd
had
filed
its
complaint
with
the
antitrust
division
of
the
justice
department
or
the
ftc,
it
would
likewise
have
no
discovery
rights
whatsoever.
and
third,
the
ec,
which
can
obtain
these
documents
directly
from
intel,
has
not
only
declined
to
do
so
in
this
case,
but
has
unequivocally
represented
to
this
court
that
permitting
parties
that
file
complaints
with
it,
thereby
to
invoke
section
1782,
will
interfere
with
its
governmental
functions.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
i'm...
i'm
confident
that
our
successive
briefs
in
this
case
provide
a
number
of
hooks,
but
i'm
going
to
give
you
one
or
two
that
i
think
are
particularly
applicable
with
respect
to
textual
interpretation,
although
obviously
we
also
would
urge
the
court,
because
this
is
a
procedural
statute,
not
one
that
grants
substantive
rights,
that
it
can
and
must
announce
general
rules
of
supervisory
power
that
outline
where
a...
where
discretion
ends
and
abuse
begins
because
another
operative
word
in
the
statute
is
may.
but
since
we're
talking
with
text,
let's
look,
for
example,
at
the
word,
interested
person.
the
innovation
of
the
statute
is
it
said,
okay,
you
can
grant
discovery
either
pursuant
to
a
letter
rogatory,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
which
is
the
ordinary
way
in
which
international
discovery
is
invoked
by
foreign
tribunals
or
foreign
sovereigns,
or
by
an
interested
person.
now,
no
one
in
this
case
says
that
interested
person
should
be
given
its
plain
meaning,
otherwise
we
would
have
essentially
a
universal
private
freedom
of
information
act.
and
so--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
we...
we
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
everybody
will
come...
everybody
who
argues
today
will
give
you
some
definition
of
what
interested
person
is,
and
none
of
them
are
the
limits
of
definitional
possibility.
so
you've
got
to
give
it
a
construction
that
is
consistent
with
the
history
and
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
to
be...
to
be
sure...
to
be
sure,
justice
ginsburg.
and
you
will
hear...
you
know,
everybody
has
their
own
favorite
contextual
interpretation
of
words
like
interested
person
or
for
use
in.
but
the
context
of
this
statute
is
discovery,
and
the
purpose,
as
made
pellucidly
clear,
is
to
reduce
the
significance
of
international
boundaries
in
discovery.
and
therefore,
what
we
say,
with
respect,
is
you
should
read
interested
person
to
mean
an
entity
that
has
at
least
some
discovery
rights
to
something
at
some
stage
of
the
process,
whether
it's
pending
or
imminent
or
reasonably
foreseeable.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in...
in
the
foreign
country,
that
is,
for
the
foreign
sovereign
who's
being
assisted.
now...
now,
amd
suggests
that
oh,
no,
no,
no,
no.
another
purpose
of
the
statute
was
the
imperial
export
of,
quote,
liberal
american
discovery
rules.
now,
we
think
that's
wrong,
but
even
if
it
were
right,
it
would
be
unavailing
in
this
case
because
it
is
undisputed
that
if
they
had
filed
a
complaint
with
any
of
the
antitrust
regulatory
authorities
here,
they
would
be
entitled
to
no
discovery
whatsoever.
and
therefore,
at
least
you
ought
to
interpret
interested
person
to
mean
a
private
entity
that
has
no
discovery
rights
whatsoever
either
in
the
foreign
proceeding
or
would
have
it
here.
i
mean,
the
very
premise
of,
quote,
liberal
american
discovery
is
that
it
is
available
when
a
private
party
undertakes
the
obligations
of
being
a
litigant.
that
is,
you
file
a...
you
can't
get
discovery
based
on
some
speculation
that
you
have
a
lawsuit.
you
get
discovery
when
you
undertake
the
obligations
consistent
with
rule
11
of
pleading
a
case.
and
what
they
are
trying
to
do...
there
is
no
case,
reported
case,
decided
by
any
court
in
the
long
history
of
this--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
think...
i
mean,
i
think
this
court
ought
to
announce
that
since
the
manifest
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
assist,
quote,
foreign
tribunals
and
litigants
before
those
tribunals,
that
the
indeterminate
words
of
the
statute
should
be
read
in
that
context.
but
even
if
you
wanted
to
say
that
discovery
would
be
available
at
least
on
a
discretionary
basis,
to
someone
who
has
some
discovery
rights
somewhere,
if
they
were
to
file
this
type
of
action
in
some
place,
that
would
also
be
useful
to
the
lower
courts.
and
there...
it
is
simply
irrational
to
say
that
a
statute
that
was
enacted
in
order
to
reduce
the
significance
of
international
boundaries
would
create
this
giant
loophole
that
creates
ubiquitously
universally
unavailable
discovery,
just
because
somebody
has...
happens
to
bring
an
administrative
complaint
in
one
country
and
seeks
to
receive
documents
that
are
available
in
this
country
when
he
or
she
couldn't
have
received
them
if
he
had
sued
here
and
where
the
foreign,
quote,
tribunal
has
stated
as
a
categorical
matter
that
resort
to
section
1782
by
complainants
before
it
will
affirmatively
undermine
its
sovereign
governmental
processes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
believe,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
i'm
sure
that
mr.
phillips,
on
behalf
of
the
ec,
will
be
able
to
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
but
whether
it
can--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i'm
giving
him
at
least
15
minutes
advance...
10
minutes
advance
warning.
the
point
here,
i
think,
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
as
whether
it
could
or
couldn't
is
a
feature
of
a
sovereign
determination
by
the
countries
that
make
up
the
european
community.
if
discovery
is
available
in
that
proceeding,
there's
no
doubt
that's
a
court
proceeding
and
that's
a
proceeding
before
a
tribunal.
and
whatever
discovery
rights--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--whatever--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it...
it
wouldn't
at
all.
if
it
could,
then,
you
know,
a
1782
request
could
be
made
in
the
unlikely
event
that
the
ec
or
the
court
couldn't
simply
do
what
it
can
do
now,
which
is
order
intel
to
produce
the
documents.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
jarringly
anomalous
result
that
they're
seeking.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
believe
that's
correct,
and
our...
they
call...
they
say
that
this
puts
them
in
a,
quote,
catch-22
or
a
conundrum,
but
it
does
nothing
of
the
sort.
the
question
before
the
court
of
first
instance
may
be...
and
this
is
assuming
a
lot
of
speculative
things
including,
among
others,
that
they
are
disappointed
with
what
the
ec
does
and
that
the
ec
doesn't
do
what
it
could
do
any
day,
including
this
afternoon,
which
is
order
intel
to
produce
these
documents,
but
assuming
documents
aren't
produced
and
the
ec
decides,
as
we
fervently
hope,
not
to
proceed
against
intel
and...
and
they
decide
that
it's
worth
it
to
go
to
the
court
of
first
instance
and
the
review
will
only
be
on
the
record
that
the
ec
compiled,
under
european
community
law
ipso
facto
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
the
ec
or
dg
comp
erred
in
declining
the
request
to
obtain
these
documents.
i
mean,
you...
we...
we
don't
have
a
proceeding...
let's
say
in
a...
just
a
regular
lawsuit
in
the
united
states.
i'm...
you
know,
intel
is
suing
amd.
intel
wants
certain
discovery.
amd
objects.
the
judge
says,
i'm
not
going
to
grant
that
discovery.
i
don't
really
think
that's
necessary.
we
don't
have
a
procedure.
you'd
be
laughed
out
of
court
if
you
came
in
and
said,
well,
nonetheless,
we
want
it
produced
so
that
if
we
lose
before
this
court
proceeding
and
we
go
up
on
appeal,
we'll
be
able
to
argue
not
only
that
the
district
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
denying
discovery,
but
we
want
to
be
able
to
show
what
those
documents
would
say.
i
mean,
nobody
has
such
a
procedure.
and
to
the
extent
that
there's
any,
quote,
conundrum
here...
and
frankly,
i
don't
see
it...
it's
a
conundrum
that
is
the
result
of
the
way
that
the
european
community
has
chosen
to
organize
its
processes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
we
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
insofar...
well,
we
think,
first
of
all,
as
the
ec
has
explained,
there
is
no
proceeding
before
a
tribunal
and
there
won't
be
unless
and
until
one
of
these
two
parties
ever
decides
to
go
to
the
european--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
we
certainly
would
win
under
it.
we
think
on
balance
that
when
the
request
is
made
by
a
private
party,
not
a
foreign
sovereign
or
tribunal,
that
the
request
should
be
made
by
somebody
who
is
a
litigant
in
pending
litigation
but
that
at
the
most,
if
the
court
were
to
say,
well,
okay,
even
in
the
context
in
which
there
is
a
private
who's
not
even
a
litigant
yet,
we're
going
to
allow
discovery
to
be
obtained
where
litigation
is,
as
the
second
circuit
has
said,
imminent,
that
is,
reasonably
likely
to
occur
and
reasonably
soon
to
occur,
because
otherwise
discovery
by
private
parties,
prior
to
the...
the
initiation
of
any
proceedings
before
a
tribunal
is
ubiquitously
unavailable
unlike
the
context
of,
for
example,
an
investigating
magistrate
or
a
criminal
prosecutor
where
it
almost
always
is
universally
available,
and
the
1996
amendment
to
the
statute
reflects
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
and
particularly
since
the
legislative
history...
the
language
of
the
legislative
history
that
explains
the
statute
continues
to
use
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
they...
what
they...
it
most
likely
reflects
the
fact
that
they
wanted
to
include
the
french
investigating
magistrates...
and
i
won't
mangle
the
language
by
trying
to
give
the
french
pronunciation...
where
it
was
arguable
whether
that
was
or
wasn't
a
tribunal.
they
wanted
to...
to
cover
it
and
therefore
pending
wouldn't
necessarily
have
been
required
in
that
context.
but
i
don't
think...
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
when
congress
considered
this
statute
at
any
point
in
its
legislative
development,
it
ever
considered...
and
it
had
no
reason
in
the
cases
to
ever
consider...
an
outlandish
request
where
a
private
party
that
doesn't
have
any
discovery
rights
at
this
stage
anywhere
in
any
country
no
matter
where
it
files
such
a
complaint
would
thereby
get
them
as
a
windfall
by
means
of
this
anachronism.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
brief,
amicus
curiae
of
the
european
commission,
states
that
what
it
wants
is
reversal.
it
wants
reversal
of
the
decision
that
sent
this
back
for
a
discretionary,
1
of
800
judges'
factor-by-factor
balancing.
now,
everybody
considers...
justice
souter,
with
respect
to
your
question
about
how
difficult
it
might
be
to
determine
foreign
discoverability,
everybody
agrees
that's
a
relevant
factor.
so
the
question
is
going
to
come
up
in
even
more
instances
if
you
don't
announce
a
rule,
either
by
construing
interested
person
or
proceeding
or
for
use
in,
that
somehow
channels
the
discretion
of
district
judges.
justice
kennedy,
pages
36
and
37
and
particularly
footnote
18
of
our
blue
brief
provide,
we
think,
the
authority
for
instances.
but
it's
basically
saying
the
way
you
do
when
you
decide
cases
involving
discovery
under
rule
26.
there
are
certain
instances
in
which,
since
we
know
what
the
statute...
there's
no
doubt
about
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
it
will
always
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
this
is
isn't
a
tribunal
or
how
soon
a
tribunal
has
to
occur,
amd
acquiesced,
and
this
is
a
point
made
in
footnote
2
of
our
reply
brief
on
page
3.
they
acquiesced...
and
this
court
granted
cert
on
the
second
question
presented...
on
the
assumption,
as
the
lower
court
found,
that
there
is
no
proceeding
before
a
tribunal
now.
otherwise,
the
question
of
whether
the
d.c.
circuit's
interpretation
of
how
soon
it
had
to
be
or
the
second
circuit's
interpretation
would
have
been
presented.
similarly,
this
morning
is
the
first
time
that...
that
amd
has
argued
that
it
was
in...
that
it
is,
in
fact,
a
litigant.
it
has
always
argued
that
you
shouldn't
read
the
interested
person
to
require
litigant
even
in
the
private
context
because
it's
only
in
the
title.
it's
only
showered
throughout
the
legislative
history,
but
it's
not
in
the
text.
but
the
question
of
when
something
is
a
tribunal
or
when
it
isn't
may
determine,
as
this
court's
questions
this
morning
suggest,
lots
of
very,
very
fact-specific
determinations
that
have
to
be
examined
perhaps
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
although
we
would
argue
that
where
the,
quote,
tribunal
itself
says
we're
not,
a
court
ought
to
accept
it.
but
if
you
simply
interpret
interested
person
or
interpret
for
use
in
in
the
context
of
a
request
by
a
private
party
before
there
is
any
proceeding,
that
where
the
request
is
by
an
entity
that
has
no
rights
of
discovery
at
all,
not
to
documents,
not
to
testimony,
not
at
the
first
stage,
not
at
the
second
stage,
and
not
in
any
subsequent
judicial
proceeding,
we
can
simply
cut
this
off.
it
will
always
be
abuse
of
discretion
to
come
to
the
united
states
and
try
and
get
discovery
when
you're
trying
to
aid
a
tribunal
that
doesn't
now
and
never
will
allow
you
to
get
any
discovery.
