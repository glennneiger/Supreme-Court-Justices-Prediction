justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
that
the
eu
committee
would
be
a
tribunal
under
the
first
sentence
if
it
asked
for
the
documents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lynch,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
prompted
by
mr.
waxman's
argument.
because
you
filed
a
complaint,
you
say
you're
an
interested
person.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was...
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
what
if
you
just
filed
an
affidavit
with
the
district
court
that
you
intended
to
file
a
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
then
be
interested?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
agree
that
there
is
some
latitude
for
construing
just
the
scope
of
what
an
interested
person
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
have
to...
you
would
have
to
look
to
foreign
law
to
determine
whether
the
person
is
an
interested
party.
