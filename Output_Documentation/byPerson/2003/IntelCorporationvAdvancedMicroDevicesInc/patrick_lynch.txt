mr.
patrick
lynch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
underline
three
points.
first
of
all,
the
question
of
the
ec's
comity
concerns.
those
concerns
deserve
respect,
but
emasculating
section
1782
is
not
the
proper
way
to
respect
those
concerns.
privilege
is
really
the
right
answer
to
the
ec's
concerns
and
the
right
answer
to
counsel's
last-expressed
concern
about
800
district
judges
reaching
different
conclusions
in
different
cases.
as
to
the
second
question,
whether
or
not
this
is
a
proceeding
before
a
tribunal,
which
seems
to
be
the
heart
of
this
case,
when
congress
enacted
or
amended
section
1782
in
1965,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
congress
intended
to
extend
the
rights
granted
under
section
1782
to
proceedings
in
foreign
countries
that
were
quasi-judicial
and
administrative
in
nature.
and
it
is
also
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
know
and
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
know
all
the
different
shapes
and
forms
that
administrative
law
might
take
in
other
jurisdictions.
mr.
patrick
lynch
well,
i...
i
think
that
the...
the
question
of
whether
a
victim
is
an
interested
person
arises--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
answer
is
that
the
court
to
which
you
can
go
in
israel
and
ask
them
to
direct
the
prosecutor
to
bring
a
prosecution
has
to
be
a
tribunal
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
patrick
lynch
but
the
prosecutor
is
not
a
tribunal.
mr.
patrick
lynch
a
person...
the
prosecutor
would
not
be
a
tribunal.
mr.
patrick
lynch
the--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--because
under
the
european
rules
of
procedure
which
i
can't
relate
to
israel,
but
i
can
relate
to
the
united
states--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--under
the--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--under
the--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--under
the
european
rules
of
procedure,
justice
breyer,
the...
the
european
commission
has
to
consider
the
facts,
has
to
apply
the
law
to
the
facts,
has
to
reach
a
decision
which
is
reviewable
by
a
court.
this
is
not--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--well--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--i
believe
that
the...
the
process
i
described
is
a
classic
example
of
quasi-judicial
activity
by
an
administrative
body.
it
would
be
an
adjudication
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
patrick
lynch
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
lynch
he
cannot
do
anything
on
his
own.
he
does
not
have
the
power
to
issue
fines.
mr.
patrick
lynch
the...
the
order
of
the
ec,
the
order
of
the
commission
is
a
final,
enforceable
judgment
in
europe
unless
the
party,
the
respondent
to
that
order,
takes
an
appeal
to
the
community
courts.
and
that
would
be
the
same
as
an
order
of
the
nlrb
or
an
order
of
one
of
our
administrative
agencies
which
is
enforceable
but
subject
to
judicial
review.
i
don't
want
to--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--when...
when
the...
the
commission--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--it...
i
think
it's
some
of
both.
if
the...
if
the--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--if
the
agency
purports
to
be
deciding
on
a
question
of
law,
like
is
this
tying,
they
would
review
the
decision
of
the
agency
the
same
way
a
u.s.
court
would
and
say,
whether
or
not
this
is
tying
under
article
82
or
article
81,
is
ultimately
a
decision
of
law
and
ultimately
the
community
courts
have
the
last
word
on
it.
if
they
were
making
a
decision,
was
the
procedure
that
was
followed
here
adequate,
did
the...
did
the
commission
properly
weigh
the
evidence,
did
it
pursue
the
right
evidence,
they
would
give...
they
would
give
deference
to
the
commission's
ability
to
decide
how
to
conduct
its
process.
so
there's
a
great
deal--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--the
fact-finding
process
is...
i'm...
i'm
at
a
loss
to
relate
it
to
u.s.
process.
there's
not
like
a
substantial
evidence--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--it...
i
think
it
clearly
defers,
but
i
can't
find
that
standard
of
review
because
the
commission
has
been
reversed
in
the
gregarian
case,
for
example,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
the
commission
has
been
reversed
because
the
facts
before
it,
according
to
the
reviewing
court,
established
a
violation--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--i
would...
i
would
say--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--with...
with
all
respect,
i
would
say
it
would
be
like
this
court
vis-a-vis
the
district
courts
or
vis-a-vis
administrative
agencies
as
opposed
to
prosecutors.
and
where...
where
i
started
on
this
point
was
that
in
enacting
1782,
congress
did
not
undertake
to
dictate
europe
or
to
any
other
country
in
the
world
exactly
our
standards
of
administrative
procedure.
mr.
patrick
lynch
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
false
premise
here.
the
difference
between
what's
going
on
in
europe
and
what's
going
on
here
is
that
europe
gave
amd
one
and
only
one
europe-wide
remedy.
in
the
united
states,
we
could
have
brought
a
private
action
in
the
district
court
for
these
very
same
violations.
in
europe,
our
only
europe-wide
remedy
was
to
go
to
the
commission.
the
european
authorities
as--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--with
all
respect,
i
would
say
we
are
in
a
litigant's
position.
under
our
interested
party
rules--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--in
the
sense
of
being
a
party
in
that
our
application
has
the
same
standing
under
european
procedural
law
as
a
complaint
would
have
here,
that
when
we
file
that
complaint,
the
commission
ipso
facto
owes
us
an
obligation
to
make
an
adjudication.
it
cannot,
just
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
disregard
our
complaint.
it
must
make
a
reasoned
decision
applying
law
to
the
facts.
it
must
consider
the
evidence.
mr.
patrick
lynch
i'm...
i
would
say
it
slightly
differently,
that
whether
you
call
us
in
the
position
of
an
american
plaintiff
right
now
or
whether
you
say
there
is
no
direct
analogy,
we
are
a
litigant
in
any
practical
sense
of
the
word.
the
commission
in
its
brief
acknowledges
that
when
you
get
down
to
that
last
step,
they
are
acting
as
a
tribunal.
they
are
making
a
reasoned
determination.
they're...
they're
doing
everything
that
our
due
process
clause--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--they
must.
mr.
patrick
lynch
well--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--well,
i...
with
all
respect,
i
don't
know
that
they've
ever
said
they
don't
want
to
consider
it.
the
indication
we
have
is
that
they
don't
have
the
resources
as...
as
an
enforcement
agency
to
go
after
this
material
which
we
think
would
be
highly
relevant.
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
according
to
the...
to
the
court
of
first
instance,
the
european
court
of
justice,
they
must
consider
the
evidence
we
put
before
them.
like
a
district
court,
they
could
presumably
say
this
is
irrelevant
evidence,
but
they--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--they
have
not
said
that.
they
have...
the...
the
commission
tells
us...
and
i
believe
counsel
has
indicated...
if
we
present
the
evidence,
they
have
an
obligation
to
consider
it
and
they
have
an
obligation
to
deal
with
that
in
their
decision.
and
they
must
make
a
reasoned
decision
which
is
reviewed
by
the
court--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--no...
no
one
connected
with
the
commission
has
said
that
to
us.
and
the...
the
commission's
briefs
i
guess
are
capable
of
that
interpretation
in
this
court.
but
what...
what
the
staff
working
with
us
says
is
that
they
don't
want
to
ask
for
it
because
of
whatever
decision
they'd
make.
but
they
have
no
have
no
objection
to
us
asking
for
it.
we
told
them
about
this
proceeding
before
we
filed
it.
we
kept
them
informed
every
step
of
the
way.
to
go
back--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--there
is
no
rule
11
for
any
proceeding
brought
in
the
european
commission.
they
have
no
direct
rule
11.
they
have
great
power
over
the
firms
that
come
before
them,
and
they're
perfectly
capable
of
protecting
themselves
from
frivolous
activity.
i
think
the
difference
between
the
commission
and
us
is
this.
when
i
finish
or
when
the
last
person
to
speak
finishes,
this
court
will
say
the
matter
stands
submitted.
the
commission
is
arguing,
in
effect,
that
it's
not
litigation
until
the
commission
says
the
matter
stands
submitted.
and
there's
this
momentary
point
when
they're
a
tribunal
and
the
door
slams
shut.
then
the
court
of
review
says,
you
didn't
come
to
the
commission
and
offer
your
evidence.
it's
taken
us
nearly
3
years
to...
to
get
access
to
this
evidence,
which
we
wish
to
put
before
the
court.
we
are
like
any
litigant
in
the
united
states
who
wants
to
say
that
the
body
charged
with
enforcing
the
labor
law,
the
body
charged
with
enforcing
the
occupational
safety
law,
has
not
properly
conducted
its
due
diligence.
we
have
a
proprietary
interest
in
our
own
right
of
coming
forward
and
presenting
persuasive
evidence
to
the--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--yes,
sir.
mr.
patrick
lynch
we
can't
be
an
interested
person
just
by
filing
a
complaint.
there
are...
there
are
the
equivalent
of--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--of
standing
requirements--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--we
would--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--we
believe
that...
that
the
minimum
that
would
be
required
is
some
proceeding
underway.
mr.
patrick
lynch
well,
yes.
i
think
the
interested
person
has
to
have
a...
a
place
as
of
right
in
the
proceeding
which...
in
which
the
aid
is
sought,
whether
that's
a
district
attorney,
whether
it
might
be
a
victim
in
israel,
whether
it's
a
competitor.
but
under
european
law,
not
just
anybody
can
walk
in
and
file
these
complaints.
you
have
to
be
a
competitor
or
a
consumer.
they're
exactly
the
same
standing
requirements
that
we
have
under
our
antitrust
law.
and...
and
the
commission
has
issued
regulations
which
are
quite
clear,
that...
that
you
must
have
standing
to
bring
such
a
complaint.
now--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--i
think
that's
a
u.s.
law
question
under
1782.
mr.
patrick
lynch
well,
again,
to
take
some
of
the
cases
like
justice
ginsburg's
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
a
proceeding
could
be
in
reasonable
contemplation
when
an
official
file
has
been
opened
to
investigate.
i
think
that's
what--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--i'm
saying
that
until
you
file
the
complaint
with
the
commission,
there
is
not
sufficient
showing
of
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
proceeding
for
anyone
to
claim...
anyone
to
claim...
that
they
are
an
interested
party.
i
don't
believe
that
the
commission,
the
european
commission,
could
come
in
and
say--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--and
there
has
to
be
some
official
act
that--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--that--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--those
were
the
words
i
was
trying
to
get
out
in
answer
to
your
earlier
question,
that
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
feel
that
although
the
process
in
europe
is
different
than
it
is
in
the
united
states
and
therefore
it
might
not
be
exactly
right
to
say
we're
a
party
in
the
context
of
u.s.
expectation,
we
are
in
a...
we're
on
a
conveyor
belt
that
inevitably
turns
us
into
a
party
if
the
process
continues
in
its
ordinary
course.
we
don't...
there's
nothing
we
have
to
do
to
make
this
into
a--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--but
that
could
happen
in...
in
any
u.s.
lawsuit.
i
mean,
the
notion
that
cases
can
be
settled--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--well,
with
all
respect,
the
rule
11...
the
notion
that
we
don't
have
an
obligation
to
the
commission
to
proceed
responsibly
implies
that
without
rule
11,
litigation
in
the
united
states
would
have
no...
that...
that
lawyers
would
be
free
to
do
whatever
they
want
to
do.
the...
the...
it's
quite
clear
under
the
commission's
rules
and
regulations
that
there
is
a
responsibility.
mr.
patrick
lynch
well,
i
think
the...
i
think
the
answer
is
there's
no
rule.
i
can't
point
to
a
rule
that
says
that,
but
the
ec
has
plenary
jurisdiction
to
regulate
amd
and
other
firms
doing
business
within
the...
within
the
community
and
they
have...
they
have
the
power--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--but...
but--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--well,
i...
i
would
just
say
it's
like
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
find
contempt
that...
that
i
don't
think
the
ec
has
had
this
problem.
mr.
patrick
lynch
but
you...
but
we
are
in
court.
when
we
file
our
complaint
with
the
ec,
we're
as
in
court
as--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--i...
i--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
in
our...
in
our
view
if
you
have
not
filed
a
complaint
with
the
commission,
you're
not
an
interested
person
and
there
is
not
a
sufficient
likelihood
of
a
proceeding
for
1782
to
apply.
there
has
to
be
in
this
context--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--we
are
saying
that
whether
you
call
that
complaint
a
proceeding,
which...
which
certainly
intel
and
the
commission
say
it
is
not,
or
whether
you
call
it--
mr.
patrick
lynch
--something
leading
to
a
proceeding,
that
it
is
a
sufficient...
it
is
sufficiently
proximate
to
a
proceeding,
and
i
think
that
was
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
tried
to
sort
of
straddle
the
problem.
mr.
patrick
lynch
thank
you.
