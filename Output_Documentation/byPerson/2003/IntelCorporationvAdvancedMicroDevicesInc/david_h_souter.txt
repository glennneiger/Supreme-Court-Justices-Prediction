how
does
it
increase
the
commission's
workload?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
sense
that
you
look
at
it
if
they
give
it
to
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
don't
you
just
say
we're
not
going
to
look
at--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
did
it...
did
it
undertake
to
dictate
to
us
that
we
should
exceed
our
standards?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
the...
the
argument
that
you...
you
mustn't,
in
effect,
limit
the...
the
discovery
here
by
the
discovery
that
they
could
have
had
over
there
because
who
knows
what
it...
i
mean,
we're
just
not
experts
in
that,
and
it's
hard
to
find
out.
we
are,
however,
at
least
closer
to
being
experts
on
what
american
law
would
provide.
is
it
plausible
to
think
that
congress
was,
in...
in
extending
this
great
example
to
the
world,
extending
an
example
which
would
provide
even
more
generous
discovery
than
american
law
would
in
a
domestic
antitrust
proceeding?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
in
other
words,
you're
simply
saying
we
can't...
we
could
sue
here.
we
can't
sue
there.
therefore,
you've
got
to,
in
effect,
give
us
the
right
of
a
litigant
here
even
though
we
are
not
there
in
a
litigant's
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
in...
not
in
the
sense
of
being
a
party
as...
as
you
would
be
if
you
brought
a
private
antitrust
complaint.
that's
all
i
meant.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
you,
in
effect,
i
think
are
telling
me,
yes,
we'll
accept
the
position
that
we
shouldn't
be
better
off
than
we
would
be
in
the
united
states
if
you
realize
that
we
are
in
the
position
of
an
american
plaintiff
right
now.
that's...
that's
your
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
go--
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
may
i
go
back
to
the...
to
the
one
point
of
your
answer
that...
that
continues
to
bother
me?
and
it
may
be
that
i...
i
don't
understand
something.
so
that's
what
i
want
you
to
help
me
on.
i
thought
their
argument
was
that
when
you
say
your
present
position
is
just
like
the...
or
is
the
position
of
a
litigant,
the
difference
between
you
as
a
litigant
over
there
and
you
as
a
litigant
here
is...
is
a
difference
in...
in
effect,
in
responsibility.
you
at
least
at
not
supposed
to
bring
an
irresponsible
complaint
in
the
united
states.
you
can
be
sanctioned
if
you
do.
they,
i
think,
are
implying
that
you
don't
have
that
obligation
of
responsibility
over
there
and
therefore
simply
by
filing
a
complaint,
without
anything
more,
you
get
a
free
ticket
to
discovery,
whereas
your
ticket
to
discovery
if
you
were
suing
in
the
united
states,
is
not
free
because
you
would
have
to
meet
a
certain
threshold
of
responsibility
before
you
bring
it,
and
therefore
your
positions
aren't
the
same.
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
contemplation
of
proceeding
has
got
to
be
present.
proceeding
can
be
in
the
future.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
different
from
united
states
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
that
respect,
you
are
not
a
litigant
in...
in
the
same
sense
that
you
would
be
required
to
be
a
litigant
for
discovery
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
unless...
unless
you
get
your
discovery
and
say,
well,
we've
learned
a
lot
of
interesting
things
about
the
other
company.
we
don't
care
about
an
antitrust
suit
now.
we've
got
what's
valuable
to
us.
we're
not
going
to
initiate
a
proceeding.
that's
what
they're
worried
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
you've
got
rule
11.
you
don't
have
rule
11
when
you're
merely
in...
in
the
ec
and
when
you're
merely
in
contemplation
of
litigation.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
is
that
a
responsibility
that
they
can
enforce
against
you
in
any
practical
sense
before
you
have
initiated
a
proceeding
with
them?
in
other
words,
in
the
case
that
they're
worried
about,
you...
you
get
american
discovery
to
learn
interesting
things
that
as
a
competitor
you
want
to
learn
and
you
drop
it
there.
does
the
ec
have
a...
have
a
means
of,
in
effect,
calling
you
to
book
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they
can
go
against
them
as
regulated
industries
quite
apart
from
their
litigant
status.
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
we
don't
have
contempt
power
if
you're
not
in
court,
and
that's
the
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
talking
about
the
situation
before
you
file
a
complaint,
the
situation
in
which
you
are
contemplating
the
complaint.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
nothing
yet
pending.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
adopting
a
pending
proceeding
rule
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
got
to
be
something
pending--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
minear,
would...
would
you
take
up
where...
where
mr.
lynch
left
off?
do
you
take...
would
you
take
the
position
that
an
interested
party
has
got
to
be
a
party
at
least
who
has
filed
a
complaint?
