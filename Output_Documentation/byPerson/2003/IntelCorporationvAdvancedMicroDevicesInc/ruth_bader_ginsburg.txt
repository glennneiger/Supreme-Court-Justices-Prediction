justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
not
at
least
a
complainant?
i
mean,
the
person
who
is
seeking
the
discovery
here
is
the
complainant,
the
one
who
comes
to
the
commission
and
says
investigate.
and
i
understand
your
third
point.
your
first
two
points
puzzle
me
because
there
is
no
counterpart
in
european
schemes
to
our
out-of-court
discovery.
it
doesn't
exist.
it
all
takes
place
under
the
control
of
the
court
and
the
direction
of
the
court.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the...
the
animal
that
the
ec
antitrust
unit
is
is
nothing
like
our
antitrust
division
where
the...
we
don't
have
that
blending.
you
don't
have
a
complainant
who
has
a
right
before
that
commission
to
submit
evidence,
to
be
present
at
their...
if
they...
if
they
do
have
a
hearing.
we
don't
have
a
complaining
party
before
the
antitrust
division
that
has
a
statutory
right
to
be
present
at
a
hearing.
so
you...
the...
the
systems
are
different
and
you
can't
compare
them
on
both
points.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even
so,
if
you
take
a
typical
civil
law
proceeding
a...
between
private
litigants,
you
can't
go
out
and
get
discovery
on
your
own.
the
court
has
to
authorize
it,
and
the
order
for
discovery
will
come
not
from
a
subpoena
that
you
sent
as
a
private
party.
it's
just...
they
don't...
so
if
we
were
to
interpret
it
your
way,
then
you
would
say,
well,
that
no
private
party
in
a
civil
law
system
that
doesn't
know
from
pretrial
discovery,
doesn't
have
anything
like
pretrial
discovery,
could
never
get
any
documents,
could
never
get
any
testimony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
talking,
mr.
waxman--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
change
your
case
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
i
thought
it
was
clear
that
the
court
proceeding
is
a
review
of
the
record
as
it
comes
to
the
court
from
the
commission,
that
is,
that
the
only
proof-taking
stage
is
before
the
commission
and
that
the
ec
courts,
both
the
tribunal
of
first
instance
and
the
ecj,
review
on
the
record
that
exists.
they
don't
take
any
proof.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
this
proceeding
stand
now?
i
mean,
this
is
a
discovery
request
and
it's
pretty...
it's
been
pending
pretty
long.
has
the
commission
made
no
preliminary
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
the
one
that
comes
up
in
the
reply
brief?
and
it...
and
this
is
intel's
brief.
so
i'm
wondering
if
the
commission
shares
the
view
that
1782
is
meant
to
deal
with
procuring
evidence
in
the
united
states
from
a
third
party,
not
from
the
party
before
the
commission,
not
from
intel
because
the
commission
can
tell
intel
you
give...
give
us
these
documents.
but
it
must
refer
to
people
who
are
not
before
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
interested
person
and
the
proceeding
is
initiated
doesn't
have
to
be
the
judicial
proceeding
or
unless
i
was
wrong
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
you
say
tribunal,
you're
talking
about
the
ec
because
the
court
of
first
instance
and
the
ecj
would
not
be
asking
for
material.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
authority
federal
district
courts
have
to
order
production
of
evidence
for
use
in
foreign
and
international
tribunals.
in
1964
seeking
to
improve
judicial
assistance
between
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries,
congress
completely
revised
the
governing
statutes
and
rules.
as
part
of
the
revision,
congress
overhauled
28
u.s.c.
section
1782
which
now
provides
that
a
federal
district
court
may
order
persons
to
give
testimony
or
produce
documents
for
use
in
a
proceeding
in
a
foreign
or
international
tribunal.
the
parties
before
us
divide
on
the
question
whether
the
congress
placed
certain
categorical
limits
on
that
discovery.
respondent,
advanced
micro
devices
or
amd
filed
an
antitrust
complaint
against
petitioner,
intel
with
the
european
commission.
acting
to
its
directorate-general
for
competition,
the
commission
conducts
investigations
into
alleged
violations
of
european
competition
rules
and
may
issue
binding
decisions
enforceable
through
fines.
final
decisions
made
by
the
commission
are
reviewable
in
european
union
courts.
amd
asked
the
directorate-general
to
seek
court's
investigation
documents
intel
had
produced
in
private
litigation
in
an
alabama
federal
district
court.
when
the
directorate-general
declined
to
do
so,
amd
itself
applied
to
a
california
federal
district
court
for
an
order
directing
intel
to
produce
those
documents.
intel
moved
to
dismiss
amd’s
application
urging
that
1782
did
not
authorize
the
discovery
amd
sought.
the
district
court
granted
intel’s
motion,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
instructed
the
district
court
to
rule
on
the
merits
of
amd’s
application.
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit,
we
now
hold
that
congress
authorized
but
did
not
require
the
district
court
to
provide
discovery
aid
to
a
complainant
such
as
amd
during
a
european
commission
investigation
that
will
end
in
a
dispositive
ruling.
intel
raises
four
questions
about
the
scope
of
discovery
aid
congress
authorized.
first,
does
a
complainant
before
the
european
commission
qualify
for
such
assistance?
second,
is
the
commission
a
tribunal
for
purposes
of
the
statute?
we
answer
yes
to
these
first
two
questions.
third,
must
a
matter
in
a
foreign
tribunal
be
pending
or
imminent
before
better
courts
may
give
aid?
and
fourth,
did
congress
bar
district
courts
from
ordering
discovery
when
the
applicant
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
the
documents
or
they
located
in
a
foreign
country?
we
answer
no
to
those
questions.
our
answers
are
based
on
the
language
of
1782
confirmed
by
the
statute’s
context.
1782
authorizes
assistance
to
any
interested
person.
a
complainant
such
as
amd,
who
has
significant
participation
rights
in
european
commission
proceedings
is
surely
an
interested
person
and
therefore,
qualified
as
a
discovery
requester
under
1782.
and
the
commission
to
the
extent
that
it
acts
as
a
first
instance
decision
maker,
qualifies
as
a
tribunal
under
the
statute.
as
the
statute’s
legislative
history
corroborates,
congress
intended
aid
for
foreign
administrative
as
well
as
judicial
proceedings
that
eventuate
in
decisions
binding
on
the
participants.
the
proceeding
for
which
discovery
is
sought
moreover,
need
not
be
pending
or
imminent
when
discovery
aid
is
sought.
congress
made
judicial
assistance
available
when
a
matter
in
a
foreign
tribunal
is
at
an
investigative
pre-adjudication
stage,
so
long
as
a
dispositive
proceeding
is
within
reasonable
contemplation.
intel
argues
that
discovery
aid
is
categorically
barred
when
the
applicant
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
the
documents
where
they
are
located
in
the
foreign
jurisdiction
or
where
they
sought
in
a
domestic
litigation
analogous
to
the
foreign
proceeding.
we
count
it
significant
that
congress
expressly
shielded
privilege
materials
but
did
not
limit
the
district
court’s
production
authority
to
materials
discoverable
in
the
foreign
proceedings,
nor
did
congress
direct
the
united
states
courts
to
engage
in
comparative
analysis
to
determine
whether
analogous
domestic
proceedings
exist.
comparisons
of
that
order
can
be
frought
with
danger
given
the
considerable
differences
in
u.s.
procedural
modes
and
those
holding
weigh
abroad.
we
know
however
that
a
district
court
is
not
required
to
grant
an
application
for
discovery
aid
simply
because
it
has
authority
to
do
so.
on
the
merits,
this
case
bears
closest
scrutiny
than
it
has
received
to
date.
the
court’s
opinion
lists
factors
that
merit
consideration
in
ruling
on
amd’s
request.
for
example,
there
is
the
stronger
course
for
gaining
evidence
in
the
united
states
from
a
nonparticipant
in
a
proceeding
abroad,
a
person
who
was
beyond
the
foreign
tribunal
jurisdiction
will
reach
as
intel
surely
is
not.
and
the
rest
activity
of
the
foreign
government,
court,
or
agency
to
federal
court
judicial
assistants
merits
respectful
attention.
we
leave
to
the
lower
courts
taking
account
of
the
guides
our
opinion
provides
to
assure
an
erring
adequate
to
determine
whether
assistance
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
to
the
judgment;
justice
breyer
has

opinion.
justice
