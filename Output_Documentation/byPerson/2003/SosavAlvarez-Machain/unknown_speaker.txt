unknown
speaker
mr.
clement,
you...
you
have
a
number
of
strings
to
your
bow.
is...
is
one
of
them
more
important
than
the
others?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it...
it's
unlikely
that
we're
going
to
go
through
the
whole
list
of
your...
your
reasons
for
reversing
here
and
say
you're
right
on
every
one.
if
we...
if
we
pick
one,
is
there
one
that
is...
that
is
more
important
to
the
government
than
the
others?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
your...
you're
just
arguing
the
federal
tort
claims
act
first.
is
that...
in...
in
this
argument
that
we're
hearing
now,
we're
dealing
with
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
not
1350?
unknown
speaker
well,
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
i...
i
suppose
the
president
or
the
attorney
general
could
make
an
order
with
respect
to
extraterritorial
arrests,
and
that
would
eliminate
one
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals.
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
you
would
have
to
get
to
that
issue
first.
unknown
speaker
and
they
said
even
if
it
had
the
authority,
it...
it
has
to
be
from
a
high
official.
unknown
speaker
were...
were
the
majority--
--mr.
clement,
may
i
ask
you?
is...
am
i
correct
in
thinking
if
we
agree
with
you
on...
on
that
issue,
that
disposes
of
the
entire
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
certainly
don't
have
to
address
that
if
you
think
they're
wrong
as
a
statutory
matter,
that
there...
there,
in
fact,
was
no
arbitrary
arrest
here.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
unknown
speaker
well,
we'd
have
to
be
pretty
ambitious
because
some
of
them
weren't
addressed
below
and
they're
contrary...
the
position
being
taken
today
is
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
previous
solicitors
general.
i
mean,
it's
kind
of
a
new
question.
i'm
not
sure
it
was
even
raised
and
argued
below.
unknown
speaker
as
to
your
first,
the
tremendous
problems,
how
many
lawsuits
are
there
of
this
1350
nature
and
how
many
have
even
gone
to
judgment?
unknown
speaker
has
congress
been
asked
to
take
a
look
at
the
statute
and
to
amend
it
or...
or
restrict
it
in
some
fashion,
1350?
unknown
speaker
are
there
bills
introduced
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
so.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that's
all...
that's
a
good
example
of
where
congress
took
action.
i...
i
just
wonder
if
it
isn't
wise
to
look
at
the
underlying
statutory
grounds
relied
upon
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
deal
with
it
that
way
and
let
congress
have
a
look
at
this
thing.
and
i'm
sure
congress
would
be
interested
in
the
views
of
the
attorney
general
and
others
who
think
it's
a
concern.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
clement,
on
that...
on
that
point,
your
point
that
there
must
be
another
federal
statute
enacted
creating
a
cause
of
action,
because
this
is
purely
jurisdictional,
i
have
yet
to
find
any
judge
who's
taken
that
position.
even
judge
bork
doesn't
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
all
the
cases
since
cort
against
ash
support
you,
but
we're
construing
a
statute
enacted
a
long,
long
time
ago,
and
there
was
all
sorts
of...
of
opinion
to
the
effect
that
there
were
at
least
two
or
three
causes
of
action
that
did
not
need
to
be
severally
created:
privacy,
protecting
ambassadors,
and
so
forth.
you
remember
the
three
examples
even
judge
bork
recognized.
if
that's
right,
then
your
fundamental
position
is...
is
totally
unsupported
by
judicial
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
cues
that
you
get
from
the
torture
victim
protection
act?
when
congress
had
1350
right
next
to
it
and
there's
not
a
word
in...
in
that
legislative
history,
it...
it
seems
to
be
a
model.
yes,
this
is
a
good
thing,
but
it's...
it's...
we
want
to
make
it
really
clear
that
torture
is
a
crime
against
humanity
and
we
want
to
include
u.s.
citizens
as
plaintiffs
as
well.
but
they
didn't
say
anything
questioning
1350.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
discussion
of
1350
by
the
proponents
of
the
torture
victim
protection
act.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
clement,
if
i...
if
i
remember,
some
of
the
briefs
have
taken
the
position
that
that's
already
an
aspect
of
international
law,
a
requirement
that
you
should
first
exhaust
in
the
country
where
the
conduct
took
place,
which
would...
would
narrow
the
scope
of
the
statute
if
we...
if
we
adopted
that
view.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the...
in
the--
--on
1350
address
the
question
of
the
authority
of
the
dea
agents
to
make
the
address,
and
if
you
have
time,
the
federal
tort
claims
provision
that
it's
governed
by
events
that
occur
abroad
as
opposed
to
the
headquarters
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
mansfield
amendment
tug
the
other
way?
that
was...
when
congress
looked
at
this,
they
restricted
dea
agents'
authority,
not
granted
it.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't...
isn't
it
possible
to
read...
and
i'm
not
sure
it
should
be
read
this
way,
but
isn't
it
possible
to
read
the
mansfield
amendment
as
simply
saying
dea
agents
should
not
go
out
in
foreign
police
raids
when
the
police
of
the
foreign
countries
make
the
raids.
stay
out
of
it.
that's
one
way
to
read
the...
the
foreign
police
action
qualification.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't...
but
it
doesn't
imply
anything
one
way
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
get
there
by
assuming
that
anything
that
the
dea
does
is
law
enforcement.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
clement.
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
or
whether
we
have
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
indications
early
in
the
country's
history
that
it
was
viewed
differently
at
the
time
of
its
adoption,
and
the...
an
attorney
general
early
on
took
that
view.
it...
it's
not
easily
answered.
i...
i
can
understand
how
with
the
recodification
where
it
then
is
put
in
with
other
jurisdictional
sections
that
it...
it
looks
somewhat
different,
but
it's
had
a
pretty
long
history.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
hard
to
ignore
all
that.
and
it's
so
easily
changed
by
congress
if
indeed
it
is
a
problem.
unknown
speaker
you
agree
it's
easily
changed
by
congress?
unknown
speaker
you
agree
it's
easily
changed
by--
unknown
speaker
--it
probably
had
in
mind
problems
of
piracy.
unknown
speaker
and
then
we
have
the
case
of
the
attack
on
the
early
diplomat
and
so
on.
i
mean,
it...
it's
had
a
long
history.
unknown
speaker
maybe
we
didn't
assault
any
ambassadors
during
that
later
period.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
i...
most
references
to
international
law
were
in
admiralty
cases
where
there's
jurisdiction
anyway.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
in
the
ambassador
cases.
unknown
speaker
it
was
pretty
clearly,
it
seems
to
me,
one
of
the
things
that
the
statute
would
have
covered
for
the
assault
of
the
french
ambassador.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
phillips--
unknown
speaker
--one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
that
i
keep
bumping
up
against...
and
i
want
to
be
sure
you
get
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
it...
that...
1980,
i
guess
it
was,
the
second
circuit
got
into
the
act
and
decided
that
case.
so
we've
had
25
years,
and
we
had
a
bunch
of
opinions.
and
i
don't
think
a
single
federal
judge
has
taken
the
position
that
you're
advocating.
unknown
speaker
i
thought...
i
thought
you'd
probably
have
a...
a
right
to
recover
damages
for
piracy,
wouldn't
you
have?
i
mean,
wouldn't
they
have
thought
in
1789
you
did?
unknown
speaker
well,
admiralty
and
maritime
law
then
i
thought
were
viewed
as
a
brooding
omnipresence.
unknown
speaker
they
weren't
the
law
of
athens.
they
weren't
the
law
of
constantinople.
they
weren't
the
law
of
rome.
they
were
the
law
of
nations.
unknown
speaker
and
that...
that...
you
can
find
lots
of
quotations
along
those
lines.
so
if
in
fact
that
was
so
then
and
you're
looking
for
a
modern
counterpart,
what's
wrong
with
what
the
european
commission
said?
i'd
be
interested
in
having
your
views
on
that
brief.
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
be
improbable
in
a
world
where
law
was
a
brooding
omnipresence
in
the
sky
to
think
that
we
preserve
it
in
the
case
of
admiralty,
maritime,
and
certain
instances
of
international
law.
but
erie
sends
it
to
the
states
once
they
decide
to
make
that
separation.
that's
an
ex
post
event.
that
doesn't
cast
an
idea
in
the
minds
of
congress.
so
if
you
have
congress
ex
ante
thinking,
of
course,
this
is
international,
as
they
thought
maritime
law
was,
then
our
task
is
to
try
to
translate
that
into
modern
terms.
and
that
brings
me
back
to
the
european
commission.
unknown
speaker
not
massive.
very
limited.
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i
keep
bringing
up
the
european
commission.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
i
agree
with
you
about
that.
unknown
speaker
so
what...
what
is...
what
i
got
out
of
that
brief...
and
i
refer
to
one,
and
i
want
to
get
your
views
on
that...
is
it
wouldn't
be
difficult
to
have
a
limited
cause
of
action,
try
to
find
the
counterpart,
and
say,
of
course,
if
congress
preempts
the
field,
as
maybe
it
did
with
torture,
that's
out.
or
if
congress
implicitly
is
hostile
to
the
cause
of
action,
that's
out.
and
if
congress
is
neutral
and
the
state
department
comes
in
and
runs
through
any
one
of
a
set
number
of
defenses,
including
political
question,
that's
out.
and
there
we
have...
what's
left
is
a
core
of
basic
human
rights
violations
that's
been
internationalized,
that's
consistent
with
international
law
as
applied
in
a
lot
of
places
and
avoids
the
political
problem.
that's
what
i'm
looking
to
shape,
and
i
want
your
view
on
that
because
we
have
a
brief
that
tries
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
correct.
unknown
speaker
that's
correct.
that's
why...
that's
why
if
i
don't
accept
your
first
argument,
can
we
achieve
your
practical
objectives
by
following
that
approach?
unknown
speaker
it
may
also--
unknown
speaker
--it
may
also
be
correct.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you're
not...
you're
not
saying
that's
a
wrong
interpretation,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
and
presumably
if
there
is
some
cause
of
action
alleged
in
any
of
these
actions
that
have
been
or
might
be
filed,
that
deal
with
something
that
is
covered
basically
by
a
treaty
that
congress
has
said
is
non-self-executing,
i
assume
that
would
displace
any
common
law
background.
unknown
speaker
okay.
mr.
phillips,
let's...
let's
assume
i
accept
your
argument
that
there
are
good
reasons
not
to
invite
the...
the...
today's
brooding
omnipresence
into
court
without
something
more
from
congress,
that
there
are
good
reasons
to
be
concerned
about
separation
of
powers
problems.
assume
also
that
i
am
convinced
or
the
court
is
convinced
that
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
there
was
an
understanding
that
there
were
certain
offenses
to
which
the
jurisdictional
provision
would...
would
provide
access
for
litigation,
piracy
offenses
and
things
like
that.
how
do
i
distinguish
today's
situation
from
yesterday's
situation
and
hold
your
way
without
being
inconsistent
with
what
i
take
it
the
understanding
was
at
the
time
in
incorporating
some
offenses
in
a
common
law
kind
of
way?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that...
that
then
just
takes
you
to
justice
breyer.
he
says--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
the
only
way
to
get
where
i
have
suggested
we
might
go
is
justice
breyer's
way?
unknown
speaker
let
me...
well,
i'm
not...
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it...
that
the
cause
of
action
was
created
from
the
language
discussing
jurisdiction.
i
am
assuming
that
the
cause
of
action
was
assumed
to
be
out
there
and
that
the
jurisdictional
provision
opened
the
door
to
the
courthouse
to
get
the
cause
of
action
in.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
absence
of...
of
action
by
the
states?
or
is
it
clear
that
there
were
only
a...
let's
say,
a
few
and
rather
limited
causes
of
action,
those
largely
arising...
well,
we
have
the
ambassador
case.
we...
we
have
offenses
at
sea.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
can
deal
with
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
they
did
use
the
word
tort,
which
is...
was...
was
surprising
to
me
that
they
used
it
at
that
early
date.
that's...
that's
one
of
my
problems
i
have
with
your
position.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
hoffman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
--how
do
you...
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
may
i
ask
this
question
as
a
matter
of
history
because
your
right
on
the
point
now?
is
there
anything
in
the
early
history
that
gives
even
the
slightest
suggestion
that
congress
wanted
to
legislate
with
respect
to
anything
that
did
not
happen
in
the
united
states
or
on
the
high
seas?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
only
ones
they
knew
about
had
taken
place
in
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
they
certainly
would
not
have
been
concerned
about
an
assault
on
the...
say,
the
english
ambassador
in
paris
by
a
frenchman.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
need
the...
the
law
of
nations
for
a
transitory
tort.
i
mean,
if
it's
a--
unknown
speaker
--you...
you
don't
need
the
law
of
nations
to
sue
on
a
transitory
tort.
unknown
speaker
if
it
was
a
tort
in
the
country
where
it
was
committed,
you...
you
could
sue
on
it
elsewhere.
unknown
speaker
if...
if
there
was
this
background
of...
of
understood
common
law
that
you
say,
how
do
you
explain
the
1781
action
of
the
continental
congress
which
is
concerned
about
the
fact
that...
that
there's
no
redress
for...
for
assault
on
ambassadors,
among
other
things?
unknown
speaker
and
they
asked
the
states,
do
something
about
it.
unknown
speaker
if
that...
that
was
part
of
the
understood
common
law,
what
is
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
goes
against
the
notion
that
there
was
an
understood
common
understanding
that
was
the
background.
it
was
understood
one
way
in
pennsylvania.
it
was
understood
another
way
by...
by
the
continental
congress.
unknown
speaker
then
why
did
they
pass
a
resolution
saying
to
the
states,
enforce
the
common
law?
unknown
speaker
part...
part
of
the
problem
i
have
with...
with
your...
your
proposal
is
that
it
leaves
it
up...
it
leaves
it
up
to
the
courts
to
decide
what
the
law
of
nations
is.
and...
and
the
ninth
circuit
here
derived
a
law
of
nations
principle
from,
among
other
things,
treaties
that
we
had
refused
to
sign,
international
agreements
that
we
had
reserved
against.
i...
i
find
that
a...
a
serious
interference
with
the
ability
of...
of
the
political
branches
to
conduct
our
foreign
affairs.
unknown
speaker
those...
those
are
pretty
polar
instances,
piracy
and...
and
sabotage
in...
in
time
of
war.
we're
talking
here
about
other
matters
that
are
not...
not
at
all
polar.
unknown
speaker
and
i...
sure,
i
can
tell
you
some
things
that
everybody
would
agree
is
against
the
law
of
nations,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
in
between
that
the
european
union
may
think
is
bad
and
we
may
not
think
is
bad.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
your
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
legal
authority
here.
the...
the...
he
was
indicted
by
a
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
i...
i
think
there's
a
good
argument
that
section
878
has
extraterritorial
application,
that
dea
agents
are
not
prevented
from
carrying
out
their
duties
across
our
borders.
unknown
speaker
well,
like
in
that
case
of--
unknown
speaker
--united
states
v.
bowman
dealing
with
a
ship
and...
and
exercise
of
criminal
law
enforcement
outside
our
borders
and
we
thought
there
was
in
that
case
no
presumption
against
extraterritoriality.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
there
may
well
not
be
in
this
dea
context
as
well.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
we
certainly...
in
bowman
we
said
that
the
coast
guard
could
enforce
revenue
laws--
unknown
speaker
--outside
our
borders,
and
very
likely
a
dea
agent
can
enforce
our
laws
beyond
our
borders.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
read
the
statute
to
include
the
one
and
not
include
the
other?
i
mean,
it...
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
slice
the
bologna
that
thin.
it
just
says
they
have
authority
to
enforce
the
laws.
now,
if...
if
you
say
that
they
can't
arrest
in
mexico,
i
assume
they
can't
investigate
in
mexico.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
the--
unknown
speaker
--how
can
you
read
the
statute
to
permit
the
one
but
not
permit
the
other?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
what
language
could
possibly
allow
you
to
draw
that...
that
distinction
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
there's
no
language
that
allows
you
to
do
that--
unknown
speaker
--between
arrest
and
investigation.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
like
that--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
and
you
said...
you
said
you
had
another
limitation
and
a
further
principle.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
second
principle?
unknown
speaker
well,
look,
there...
that
amendment
refers
to
foreign
police
action.
there
wasn't
any
such
here.
unknown
speaker
none.
i
don't
see
how
it
falls
within
that
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
term
direct
mean?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
sense
every
arrest
is
a
direct
arrest.
there's
no
such
thing
as
an
indirect
arrest
i
suppose
on
that
theory.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
direct
refer
to
the...
to
the
actions
of
the
agents?
unknown
speaker
if
that
was
so,
why
didn't
he
just
eliminate
from
this
as
part
of
any
foreign
police
action?
why
is
that
phase
in
there?
yes.
unknown
speaker
oh,
no,
no,
no,
no.
but
that's
not--
--you...
you
don't
think
foreign
police
means
foreign
police?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you...
you
think
it's
foreign
police
action.
unknown
speaker
okay.
you
had--
--oh,
i
think
you
have
to
look
very
closely
at
that
language
and...
and
i
think
it
may
well
not
fit
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
had...
you
told
me
you
were
going
to
give
me
two
more
principles.
unknown
speaker
one
was
mansfield.
what...
what's
next?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
they
did
it.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the...
the
two
things
that
maybe
you're
going
to
address
now
that
are
bothering
me
the
most
and
they're
related
is
what
the
dea
says
is
that
this
was
a
person
who
people
in
mexico
tortured
to
death.
this
was
not
that
they
went
in
there
for
narcotics
reasons.
they
wanted
to
get
the
people
who
had
tortured
an
american
to
death.
and
how
do
we
decide
such
a
thing?
should
each
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
decide
that
independently?
it's
related
to
the
problem
of
mr.
mbeki.
apartheid
is
a
terrible
thing,
but
according
to
the
government,
mr.
mbeki,
i
take
it...
that's
the
highest
authority,
the
president
of
south
africa,
has
told
the
united
states
that
the
judicial
efforts
to
give
compensation
to
victims
are
interfering
with
his
efforts
to
build
a
democratic
south
africa.
now,
i
have
to
choose
between
those
two?
i'd
say
democratic
south
africa,
protective
of
human
rights
has
it
all
over
compensating
the
victims
even
though
that's
terrible.
and
what
i'm
asking
you
is
what
kinds
of
principles
do
you
suggest
that
will
allow
mr.
mbeki
to
decide
what's
right
there
and
not
40
independent
federal
judges
somewhere.
and
how
will
we
decide
such
things
as
to
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
effort
to
get
a
torturer
or
whether
it
is
a
violation
of...
of
law?
what
are
the
principles
of
limitation
in
these
areas?
unknown
speaker
how
can--
unknown
speaker
--how
is
that
consistent
with
an
acknowledgement
that
there
is
an
automatically
self-executing
brooding
omnipresence
of
customary
international
law?
unknown
speaker
that's
just
inconsistent
with
such
a
notion.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
commander-in-chief
of
the
armed
forces?
would
that...
would
that
suffice?
unknown
speaker
or
the
secretary
of
state.
i
want
to
know
how
far
down
you
go.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoffman,
a
moment
ago
you
cited
the
charming
betsy
for
a
principle
that
we
defer
to
international
law.
where
is
that?
i
don't
see
any
reference
to
it
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
well...
yours
is
the
red
brief?
unknown
speaker
oh,
the
other
red
brief.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
other...
what
if
the
foreign
state
has
no
objection
to
it?
what
if
the
foreign
state
agrees,
we
would
like
help
from
american
dea
agents?
unknown
speaker
under
your
theory,
you'd
say--
unknown
speaker
--this...
this
statute
simply
does
not
authorize
foreign
arrests.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
there...
there...
i
think
that
the
conduct
that
was
the
basis
for
the
indictment
here,
the
kidnap
and
torture
and
murder
of
a
u.s.
dea
agent
in
mexico,
can
be
punished
in
the
united
states
in
accordance
with
international
law
under
the
effects
doctrine
because
we
can
criminalize
conduct
occurring
in
another
country
that
has
an
effect
on
our
country's
security
or
core
national
interests,
which
clearly
this
did.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
suppose
he'd
been
guilty,
convicted,
30
years.
okay?
now,
does
he
get
damages
from
the
united
states
on
your
theory
for
every
day
he
spent
in
prison?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
an
identical
case...
an
identical
case.
he's
convicted,
sent
to
prison
for
20
years.
does
he
get
damages
for
each
of
those
days?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
right
rule
in
your--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
that's
one
of
the
problems.
i
want...
but
i...
i've
tried
to
focus
the
main
problem
by
calling
to
mind
mr.
mbeki,
and
the
reason
is
because
it's
such
a
good
example.
i
would
have
thought
apartheid
does
violate
norms
of
international
law
certainly
where
violence
attaches.
i
would
have
thought
there
are
lots
of
private
people
who
aid
and
abet.
i
would
have
thought
it
would
be
easy
to
find
a
victim
and
bring
a
lawsuit,
and
i
would
have
also
thought
it's
not
totally
beyond
question
that
the
president
of
a
country
could
think
they're
counterproductive...
those
lawsuits...
in
terms
of
the
democracy
we're
trying
to
build.
so
i've
tried
to
create
some
tension
there,
and
i
want
to
know
you,
who
want
a
rule--
unknown
speaker
--that
allows
these
suits
in
the
court...
how
does
it
become
limited
in
this
circumstance,
an
analogous
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i
chose
in
my
example
aiding
and
abetting
by
a
private
citizen
of
the
very
bad
thing
of
apartheid
leaving...
leading
to
deaths
and...
and
violence,
et
cetera,
as
happened.
and...
and
if
i
can't...
now,
the
european
commission
has
a
method
here
in
their
brief.
so
i'm
interested
is
that
a
proper
method.
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
propose
some
other
method,
but
to
propose
no
method--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
to
me,
is
to
concede--
unknown
speaker
--the
validity
of
the
government's
point
about
lawsuits
here.
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
that
doctrine
require
you
to
lose
this
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
require
you
to
lose
this
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
what
tort
issue...
what--
--that's
fine.
why...
why
couldn't
you
sue
him
in
mexico,
service
by
mail?
unknown
speaker
why...
why
can't
you
sue
in
mexico?
we're
talking
about
exhaustion
of
local
remedies?
why
couldn't
you
have
sued
him
in
mexico?
unknown
speaker
he
committed
the
tort
in
mexico.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
don't
need
it.
you...
you
serve
by
mail.
that's
notice.
you
certainly
do
have
personal
jurisdiction
over
him
where
he
acted.
unknown
speaker
that's
because
a
lot
of
people
don't
think
it's
part
of
international
law
probably.
unknown
speaker
what
about
restricting
these
lawsuits
to
instances
of
violation
of
basic
norms
of
international
law
where
the
international
law
itself
foresees
universal
jurisdiction
in,
of
course,
the
absence
of
some
indication
from
congress
that
they
don't
want
such
lawsuits?
unknown
speaker
what
about
that...
that
will
not
help
your
case
i
don't
think
in
this
instance,
but
i'm
looking
in
your
opinion
as
an--
unknown
speaker
--it's
the
human
rights
enforcement
push,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
about...
what
about
the
principle
that
you
have
some
such
violations
which
will
work
well
if
judges
in
every
nation
try
to
enforce
them
and
others
where
the
judges
will
fall
over
themselves
with
contradictory
decisions
creating
a
mess?
and
one
good
way
to
separate
the
former
from
the
latter
is
to
look
to
see
if
universal
jurisdiction
is
part
of
or
at
least
foreseen
by
or
at
least
consistent
with
the
international
law
norm.
i'm
looking
for
ways
that
are
going
to
avoid
the
problems.
unknown
speaker
but
in
many
countries,
criminal
jurisdiction
is--
unknown
speaker
--accompanied
by
civil
jurisdiction--
unknown
speaker
--because
they're
right
in
the
criminal
courtroom.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
did...
they
did
in
the
tort
victim
protection
act
provide
a
definite
claim,
something
with
a...
with
a
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
not
here,
something
with
a
definition
of
what
torture
is,
not
tort,
the
world
of
tort,
so
that...
that
that
looks
like
a
model
of
specificity
where
1350
is
just
the
opposite.
unknown
speaker
but
you...
you
do...
in
1983,
you
do
have
reference
to
very
specific
things,
to
provisions
of
federal
statutory
law
or
to
provisions
of
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
suit
based
on
some
norm
covered
by
a
treaty
where
congress...
where
the
senate
has
said
it's
non-self-executing?
unknown
speaker
who...
who
decides
this?
i'm
really
am
sort
of
in
the
woods
as
to--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
what...
what--
unknown
speaker
--51
percent
of
the
countries
of
the
world
accept
them?
they're...
they're
customary
norms?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
recall
sabbattino?
i
thought
the
assumption
the
court
made
in
sabbattino
was
that
there
was
a
clear
violation
of
international
law,
but
nevertheless,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
applied.
that's
my
recollection
of
justice
harlan's
opinion.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
what
prompted
justice
white's
dissent.
he
was
so
upset
by
the
fact
that
it
was
a
clear
violation
of
law,
but
we
nevertheless
would
give
the
defense
act
of
state
doctrine
to
cuba.
but
you
may
be
right,
but
that's
my...
it
was
my
recollection
of
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
mr.
clement,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
