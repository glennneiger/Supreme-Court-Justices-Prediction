mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
guess
i'd
like
to
begin,
justice
o'connor,
with
your
question
about
whether
or
not
this
is
an
issue
that
the
court
ought
to...
the...
the
underlying
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
section
1350
is
an
issue
the
court
ought
to
resolve
as
opposed
to
the
narrower--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
you
clearly
don't
have
to,
and...
and
certainly
jose
francisco
sosa
would
be
perfectly
content
to
have
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
arrest
here
was
neither
arbitrary
nor
the
detention
prolonged
in
a
way
that
would
no...
under
no
circumstances
violate
the
law
of
nations.
but
the
truth
is,
as
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
for
the
respondents
points
out,
there
are
at
least
35
cases
that
they
cite
in
their
briefs
that
have
been
filed
under
section
1350.
those
causes
of
action
involve,
each
one,
numerous
individual
defendants.
there
is
a
significant
reason
i
think
for
this
court
to
try
to
provide
some
additional
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
section
1350,
particularly
when
the
rules
of
construction,
as
justice
stevens
quite
rightly
pointed
out,
so
clearly
point
in
a
particular
direction.
this
is
a
purely
jurisdictional
statute.
it
says
it
in
so
many
terms.
the
only
language
that
the
respondent
embraces
as
suggesting
that
it's
not
purely
jurisdictional
is
the
word
violation,
a
word
this
court
specifically
recognized
in
touche
ross
is
not
a
rights-creating
term,
but
instead
again
merely
provides
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
when
you
have
merely
jurisdiction,
you
do
not
imply
a
cause
of
action.
that's
the...
the
montana-dakota
utilities
decision
of
the
court.
obviously
that's
embedded
in
sandoval.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
the
presumption
ought
to
go
the
other
way
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
lower
courts
have
created
a
problem,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
try
to
fix
that
problem
if
that's
an
available
option--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
think
anything
is
easily
changed
by
congress
these
days.
[laughter]
but...
but,
justice
o'connor,
your...
your
point
brings
to
mind,
frankly,
justice
frankfurter's
observations
in
the
romero
case
about
comparing
the
historical
efforts
here
to
archaeology
and
the...
and
as
one
who
has
now
spent
the
better
part
of
the
last
6
months
on
what
struck
me
as
a
historical
dig
that
accumulated
a
whole
lot
of
information,
virtually
none
of
which
remotely
provides
me
with
any
insights
at
to
what
the
congress
of
1789
really
had
in
mind
at
the
end
of
the
day,
i
think
the
court
would
do
extremely
well
here
to
go
back
to
the
first
principles
of
statutory
interpretation.
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
clearly
had
in
mind
problems
of
piracy,
but
as
even
blackstone
made
clear,
problems
of
piracy
are
matters
of
public
concern.
they
are
not
matters
of
private
concern.
and
while
it
may
well
be
that
congress
did
have
in
mind
down
the
road
that
there
may
be
subsequent
enactments
that
would,
in
fact,
invoke
section
1350
as
an
exercise
of
jurisdiction--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
first
of
all,
there's
an
interesting
gap
in
that
history
because
you
go
up
till
about
1807
and
then
nothing
happens
until
1982.
so
it's
a
little
difficult
to
think
that
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
historians
out
there
thinking
that
there
was
a
clear
basis
for
a
cause
of
action
tapping
in
to
the
law
of
nations
and
to
those
kinds
of
rights.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
certainly
hope
we
didn't.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure,
absolutely.
and
that...
that's
why--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
not...
well,
it's
not
100
percent
clear
to
me
because
the...
the
problem
you
have
there
is
that
it
would
clearly
have
been
a
public
right
and
it
was...
and,
you
know,
the
congress
in
1790
immediately
passes
a
statute
that...
that
imposes
criminal
sanction
for
this.
and
indeed,
justice
o'connor,
even
in
the...
even
in
the
pennsylvania
case
where
it
arose
out
of
common
law,
it
was
a...
it
was
criminal
action
that
was
brought
against
the
attacker
on
the...
on
the
ambassador.
it
was
not
a
civil
action.
no
one
sought
damages.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
this
is
a
very
unknown
enterprise.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't...
i
don't...
i
don't
disagree
with
it.
i
think
that's
absolutely
true.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
a
whole
lot
of
those
judges
gave
quite
as
much
thought
or
attention
to
this
issue
as
the
litigants
before
this
court
have
in
this
particular
case.
and
the
briefing
here
is
obviously
extraordinary
both
in
its
breadth
and
depth.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day...
and...
and
i
don't
think
anybody
tried
to
mine
the
historical
materials
in
quite
the
same
intensity
as
we
have
coming
here.
and
as
i
said--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it's
not
clear,
but
if
you
would
have,
it
would
have
been
under
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
were.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
let...
let
me
answer
the
first
question
because
the
difference
between
incorporating
the
law
of
nations
from
the...
into
admiralty
jurisdiction,
it
had
a
tradition
of
1,000
years.
the
idea
of
interpreting
the
law
of
nations
or
incorporating
the
law
of
nations
into
section
1350
or
its
precursor
back
then
where
it
only
benefits
aliens
seems
to
me
a
quite
improbable
undertaking
by
congress
in
1789.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i...
i...
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that,
justice
breyer,
is
i
think
this
court
has
rebelled
from
the
idea
that
it's
going
to
incorporate
a
massive
brooding
omnipresence--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
see,
i
don't
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
see,
that's
my
problem
with
that...
with
that
argument
because
it
doesn't...
i
don't
see
what
the
limitation
is,
justice
breyer.
what
we're
dealing
with
is
if
you're
saying
the
law
of
nations,
customary
international
law,
whatever
that
means...
and
we
know
from
the
ninth
circuit
it
doesn't
have
to
be
anything
that
the
united
states
itself
embraces.
these
are
rules
that
are
imposed
upon
us
under
these...
under
these
circumstances.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you're
going
to
bring
it
into
the
modern
era,
you
ought
to
bring
it
in
with
the
recognition
that
there
are
core
separation
of
powers
concerns
in
this
context
that
ought
to...
ought
to
caution
hesitation
in
exactly
the
same
way--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
the
federalism
principle
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
that
brief
assumes
that
1350
does
more
than
provide
jurisdiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
assumes
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
to
be
sure.
there...
i
mean,
that
would
take
you
back
to,
i
think,
justice
o'connor's
question
which
is,
could
you
resolve
this
particular
case
by
reference
to
an
understanding
of
the
law
of
nations
that...
that
rejects
any
notion
that
this
was
an
arbitrary
act
or
that
the
detention
here
was
prolonged
within
the
meaning
of
the
restatement,
third,
of
foreign
relations?
and...
and
to
be
sure,
that's
a
narrower
basis
for
deciding
and
that
is
the
focus
of
the
commission's
brief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that
on--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
to
be
sure,
it's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no.
absolutely
not.
and
if
you're
in
that
world
and
you're
looking
at
those...
at
those
circumstances,
you
obviously
would
have
to
take
a
very
narrow
approach
in...
in
terms
of
trying
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
that
you
raise
an
important
point
there
which
is
the
parallelism
between
the
treaty
prong
and
the
law
of
nations
prong
of
the
statute
because
if,
as...
as
judge
bork
explained
in
his
separate
opinion,
the
thing
that
disturbed
him
the
most
about
this
was
the
suggestion
that
somehow
on
behalf
of
aliens,
you
would
create
a
right
under
the
treaty
that
you
would...
that...
that
citizens
would
never
have
had
the
right
to
because
it
wouldn't
be
self-executing.
it
seemed
quite
improbable
that
congress
would
have
intended
that.
so
by
parity
of
reasoning,
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
create
this
kind
of
access
into
a
brooding
omnipresence
of
law
that
is
essentially
very
difficult
to
confine?
and
i...
and
i
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
point
which
is,
to
be
sure,
there
are
ways
to
try
to
narrow
those
rules.
my
position
is
you
do
better
not
to
try
to
go
down
that
path
in
the
first
place.
you
would
do
better
to
recognize
that
this
is
a
purely
jurisdictional
statute
and
thereby
force
congress
to
look
in
the
future
at
statutes
like
the
torture
victim
protection
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
ensure
consistency
there
would
be
to
insist
that
there
be
a...
a
real
clarity,
both
that
the
united
states
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no.
then
that's
my
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
i
think
in
that
world--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
i...
i
don't
know
that
it's
the
only
way,
but
it
is
the
simplest
way
to
get
to
that
kind
of
consistency
if
you
accept
the
premise
that
congress
necessarily
believed
in
1789
that
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
created
from
language
discussing
merely
jurisdiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
can...
can
i
challenge
that
assumption--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
souter?
because
if
you
look
at
the
historical
record
and
go
back
to
the
1781
continental
congress
saying
to
the
states,
there
is
no
brooding
omnipresence,
we
need
you,
states,
to
go
out,
take
action
to
deal
with
ambassadors
to
protect
them--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but...
but...
the...
the...
i...
i
think
there
are
no
causes
of
action
because
the...
if
you
take
seriously...
why...
why
would
the
continental
congress
say
to
the
states,
enact
a
statute
to
protect
ambassadors
if
ambassadors
are
otherwise
being
protected?
why
does
connecticut
then
go
forward
and
enact
a
law
that
not
only
provides
criminal
protection
for
the
ambassadors
but
goes...
goes
beyond
that
and
provides
civil
remedies,
liability
and
damages
for
attacks
on
ambassadors,
if
there
is
this
brooding
omnipresence?
the
point
is...
my...
my
basic
point
is
i
don't
think
the
historical
record
will
demonstrate
to
you
at
all
that
these
causes
of
action
existed.
and
therefore,
this
is
not
a
simple
instance
of
the
courts...
of
the
congress
trying
to
tap
in
to
a
body
of
law.
what
it
was
doing
was
creating
a
jurisdictional
basis
to
be
filled
in
in
the
future.
in
that
sense,
i
don't
think
the
congress
of
1789
came
to
the
table
to
deal
with
this
issue
dramatically
differently
than
the
congress
today
would...
would
deal
with
it.
they
enact
jurisdictional
provisions
all
the
time.
to
be
sure,
1331
has
eliminated
the
need
for
a
lot
of
this.
but
the
reality
is
you...
you
create
the
jurisdiction
and
then
you
fill
the
vessel.
and
this
court
has
got
a...
you
know,
an
obviously
long
line
of...
of
opinions
in
which
it's
recognized
jurisdiction
doesn't
create
federal
common
law
rules,
jurisdiction
doesn't
create
a
right
of
action.
it
simply
creates
jurisdiction.
and
if
this
court
goes
back
to
that
core
principle
as
the
method
for
trying
to
interpret
section
1350,
it
will
avoid
all
of
the
problems
and
then
force
congress
to
take
the
action
that
i
think
is
important
here.
the...
the
torture
victim
protection
act
has
a
statute
of
limitations,
has
an
exhaustion
requirement,
has
a
definition
of
torture.
congress
wasn't
implementing
section
1350
there.
it
was
implementing
its
obligations
under
international
agreements
dealing
with
the
question
of
torture.
my
guess
is
we
have
similar
kinds
of
provisions
that
are
out
there
that
we
probably
ought
to
be
trying
to
find
causes
of
action
for,
and
congress
should
take
those
up.
but
what
shouldn't
happen
is
to
allow
the
courts
exercising
what
i
submit
is
an
extraordinary
federal
common
law
power
to
go
out,
find
causes
of
action,
and
then
proceed
to
define
all
of
their
elements,
all
of
their
defenses
without
the
benefit
of
any
guidance,
which
is
precisely
how
you
end
up
in
a
situation
today
where
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that
in
a
situation
where
a
mexican
national
assists
the
united
states
to...
to
enforce
an
arrest
warrant,
and
the
circumstances
presented
in
this
case
that
he's
not
only
engaged
in
an
arbitrary
act,
but
that
the
detention
is...
is
wrongful
in
its
own
right,
not...
even
though
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
the
united
states
would
have
embraced
that
view
with
respect
to
its
own
obligations
as
a
matter
of
international
law.
once
you
open
this
door--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
you
should
deal
with
that
issue,
but...
but,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
you
should
try
to
deal
with
the
broader
issue
because
there
are
just
too
many
of
these
cases
out
there
creating
too
much
havoc
for
no
good
reason,
if
i'm
right,
that
the
congress
in
1789
did
not
have
in
mind
something
anywhere...
anything
like
what
we've
seen
since
1982.
and
if
it's
just
as
easy
for
this
court
then
to
go
back
to
first
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute
and
say
enough
is
enough.
if
there
are
no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--they
did
use
the
word
tort.
it's
unfortunately,
obviously
having
spent,
as
i
said,
a
long
time
in
my
historical
dig,
i
haven't
been
able
to
figure
out
why
they
pulled
out
the
word
tort
under
those
circumstances.
it
doesn't
really
have
an
analog.
it
would
have
been
more
sensible
if
they
had...
had
used...
i
mean,
they
didn't
actually
need
the
term
limit.
i...
i'm
sure
it's
a
term
of
limitation.
i
think
what
they
were
concerned
about
were...
were
debts.
i
think
that's
what
they
were
worried
about.
they
didn't
want
aliens
to
be
coming
in
and
trying
to...
trying
to
deal
with
debts.
they
were...
they
were
trying
to
stay
away
from
that.
they
were
worried,
obviously,
at
the
end
of
the
day
with
injuries.
but...
but
i
agree
with
you,
justice
kennedy,
it's
an
odd
choice
of
words,
given
how
little
law
was
developed
on
torts
generally
and
how
no
law
was
developed
under
the
law
of
nations
involving
torts
specifically.
i've
already
taken
up
enough
of
your
time.
