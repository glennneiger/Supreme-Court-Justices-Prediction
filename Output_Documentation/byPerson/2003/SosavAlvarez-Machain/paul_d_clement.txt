mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
arrest
at
issue
here
was
one
unauthorized,
false,
and
in
violation
of
international
law
because
it
occurred
in
mexico.
nonetheless,
the
court
found
inapplicable
the
exception
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
claims
arising
in
a
foreign
country.
at
the
same
time,
the
court
read
the
bare
jurisdictional
terms
of
section
1350
in
title
28
to
provide
courts
with
the
authority
to
infer
causes
of
action
from
sources
of
customary
international
law,
including
treaties
that
the
political
branches
have
expressly
refused
to
ratify.
the
resulting
decision,
which
reads
express
grants
of
executive
authority
narrowly
and
implied
grants
of
judicial
authority
broadly,
turns
the
established
separation
of
powers
regime
for
dealing
with
international
issues
on
its
head.
the
ninth
circuit
first
construed
executive
authority
narrowly
by
holding
that
the
dea
agents
lacked
the
authority
to
effect
an
arrest
in
mexico
or
abroad.
that
decision...
that
holding
has
several
problems,
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
by
its
terms
it
would
preclude
federal
agents
from
making
an
arrest
abroad
even
in
circumstances
where
the
foreign
country
consents
or
there
is
no
foreign
government
that
is
functioning
to
provide
consent.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
regrettably--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
regrettably,
justice
scalia,
this
is
the
rare
case
where
i
think
they
really
are
of
quite
significance
because
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
is,
on
the
one
hand,
federal
agents,
including
the
fbi,
would
lack
the
authority
to
make
arrests
abroad.
they've
also
ruled
in
a
way
that
i
think
really
reads
the
foreign
country
exemption
out
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
then,
of
course,
on
the
1350
issue,
that
is
an
issue
of
tremendous
importance
to
the
government
and
also
to
the
broader
community.
so
i
guess
if--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
actually
intend
to
cover
them
both
in...
in
my
initial
period.
now,
mr.
phillips
is
going
to
be
covering
just
1350
because
that's
the
only
issue
that
affects
his
client.
but
the
united
states
is
both
the
petitioner
in
the
case
that
raises
the
federal
tort
claims
act
issue,
but
also
a
respondent
in
support
of
petitioner
with
respect
to
1350.
so
it's
an
ambitious
goal
in...
in
25
minutes,
but
i
hope
to
address
them
both.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
you
are
wrong
about
that,
justice
kennedy,
because
as
i
read
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit,
they
say
that
the
president,
the
executive,
the
attorney
general
lack
the
authority
to
make
an
extraterritorial
arrest,
and
they
specifically--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right.
now,
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
actually
wasn't
the...
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
opinion.
there's
a
concurrence
by,
i
think,
five
of
the
six
justices
in
the
majority
that
said
at
a
minimum
you'd
need
a
high-ranking
official,
but
the
majority
opinion
that's
the
law
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
that
regardless
of
who
approves
the
operation,
the
president
categorically
lacks
that
authority.
and
that's,
of
course,
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i...
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
now,
i
would
say
that
it...
the
other
issues
in
the
case
are
logically
in
some
respects
anterior
to
that
question,
especially
because
the...
for
example,
the
section
1350
really
is
a
question
about
the...
the
very
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right,
justice
o'connor.
there's
no
way
i
can
tell
you
that
you
have
to
address
those
other
issues.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think,
though,
there's
nothing
that
would
stop
the
court
from
addressing
those
issues,
and
those--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
we
think
it
was
raised
and
argued
below,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
the
1350
issue
is
of
tremendous
continuing
importance.
i
mean,
if
i
could...
if
i
could
address
the
point
that
you
raised
about
the
change
in
position.
it
is
true
that
the
united
states
in
the
filartiga
case
took
a
different
position.
now,
subsequent
that...
to
that,
the
administration
has...
different
administrations
have
taken
the
position
that
1350
is
just
jurisdictional.
and
if
i
could
draw
an
analogy
to
the
experience
that
this
court
has
had,
in
1947
this
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
state
statutes
that
provided
reciprocity
in
inheritance
laws
with
foreign
countries
and
said
that
was
okay.
21
years
later,
with
the...
sort
of
benefit
of
hindsight
and
the
experience
with
state
court
judges
causing
foreign
policy
problems,
this
court
in
the
journing
case
revisited
that
decision.
and
in
a
similar
way,
i
think
the
20-years-plus
experience
that
we've
had
with
the
filartiga
regime
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
these
lawsuits
provide
tremendous
problems
for
the
foreign
policy
interests
of
the
united
states.
and
at
the
same
time,
in
the
intervening...
intervening
period,
if
anything,
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
what
the
proper
mode
of
finding
a
cause
of
action
is
and
the
proper
way
to
read
a
jurisdictional
provision.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
regrettably,
i
don't
have
the
numbers
on
those.
but
i
think
one
thing
that's
important
to
emphasize
is
that
the
case
doesn't
have
to
go
to
judgment
to
create
potential
foreign
policy
problems
for
the
united
states.
and
to
give
you
just
one
example,
there's
litigation
that's
ongoing...
it
hasn't
gone
to
judgment.
it's
quite
preliminary...
in
new
york
right
now,
where
people
are
seeking
compensation
for
abuses
that
occurred
during
the
apartheid
regime
in
south
africa.
now,
the
government
of
south
africa
itself,
of
course,
has
a
very
different
mechanism
for
dealing
with
those
issues,
the
truth
and
reconciliation
process.
and
the
government
of
south
africa
has
formally
protested
at
the
highest
levels
that
these
issues
that
are
very
difficult
issues
for
that
government
and
that
government
is
dealing
with
are
the
subject
of
litigation
in
the
united
states
courts.
and
i
think
what
you
see
is
time
and
time
again
you
have
private
litigants
that
may
be
very
well
intentioned
but
are
focused
on
only
a
single
issue
and
they
are
bringing
that
issue
into
the
courts,
creating
foreign
policy
problems
for
the
executive
branch
which
the
executive
branch
then
has
to
try
to
remedy
and
ameliorate.
at
the
same
time,
in
the
process
of
those
lawsuits,
you
have
courts
making
pronouncements
on
principles
of
international
law
and
customary
international
law
that
may
well
be
at
variance
with
the
views
of
the
executive
branch
or--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
sure
there
have
certainly
been--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
know
that
any
bills
are
pending,
but
i
do
think
that
congress
is
certainly
fully
able
to
deal
with
this
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
definitely,
and...
and...
but
i
think
when
congress
does
deal
with
this
situation
and
actually
provides
for
a
cause
of
action,
that
provides
a
much
better
solution
to
this
problem.
and
i
think
if
i
could
point
to
the
torture
victim
protection
act
as
an
example
of
what
happened--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again,
justice
o'connor,
i
mean,
i
can
only
repeat
that
there's
nothing
that
would
stop
this
court
from
resting
its
decision
only
on
the
extraterritorial
authority
question
and
that
would
certainly
be
a
significant
correction
of
the
law
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
left
us--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
that...
that...
i
don't
know
that
judge
randolph
in
his
separate
opinion
in
the
al
odah
case
expressly...
if
you
can
tell
exactly
where
he
would
come
down
on
that.
i...
i
actually
read
his
opinion
as
consistent
with
the
position
we're
urging,
but
i
of
course
may
have
an
interest
in
doing
so.
i
would
say
this,
though,
that
i
think
that
if
you
read
this
court's
precedents
for
dealing
with
a
cause
of
action...
in
finding
a
cause
of
action,
there's
no
question
that
the
1350
is
applied
pursuant
to
those
modern
principles--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
justice
stevens,
let
me
take
that
in
a
couple
of
steps.
first
of
all,
i
mean,
certainly
judge
bork
thought
that
maybe
those
original
causes
of
action
would
be
actionable
in
federal
court
at
the
time.
now,
first
of
all,
to
make
clear,
what
the
first
congress
did
is
rather
than
pass
any
kind
of
tort
action,
it
dealt
with
those
three
very
offenses
against
the
law
of
nations
and
dealt
with
them
criminally.
now,
it
may
be
that
what
judge
bork
had
in
mind
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
framing,
as
a
matter
of
general
common
law
in
the
pre-erie
sense,
it
might
have
been
possible
to
get
into
federal
court
and
raise
those
three
violations
against
the
law
of
nations
as
a
tort
action.
i
don't
think,
however,
that
authority
would
survive
erie
in
any
event,
and
i
think
it
raises
some
questions
of
its
own.
now,
i
think
you're
absolutely
right,
though,
justice
stevens,
to
say
that
the
one
objection
you
would
have
to
applying
straightforwardly
the
principles
that
this
court
has
adopted
in
cases
like
cort
against
ash
and
sandoval
is
that
this
statute
was
passed
at
a
much
earlier
time
and
where
the...
the
enacting
congress
may
have
had
different
assumptions
in
mind.
but
this
court
has
made
clear
that
it's
not
going
to
sort
of
tether
its
analysis
to
what
assumptions
the
enacting
congress
might
have
had
in
mind.
it
did
so,
of
course,
in
the
sandoval
decision.
but
you
did
so
yourself,
justice
stevens,
in
your
separate
opinion
in
california
against
sierra
club
where
you
said
that
it
may
very
well
have
been
that
the
congress
in
1890
that
passed
the
rivers
and
harbor
act
probably
assumed
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
in
court,
but
you
said
it
was
more
important
to
apply
the
principles
of
cort
against
ash
in
that
case
than
to
try
to
divine
the
intent
of
an
enacting
congress
from
100
years
earlier.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
could
just
make
sure
that
there's
one
fact
that's
on
the
table,
which
is
you
said
that
they...
that
congress
effectively
had
the
provisions
side
by
side,
and
i
think
it
is
worth
noting
that
although
the
torture
victim
protection
act
is
now
codified
as
a
note
to
1350,
that
was
not
a
decision
congress
made.
that
was
just
a
codification
decision.
so
congress
itself
didn't
say
insert
in
the
code
after
1350--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there
certainly
was
and
i
think
that...
that
basically
the
enactment
of
congress
is...
sort
of
says
nothing
about
1350
one
way
or
another.
what
i
would
point
to
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
though,
is
a
model
of
why
it
makes
sense
to
ask
congress
to
get
involved
in
creating
a
cause
of
action
because
when
it
does,
it
provides
clear
direction
to
the
court
and
also
acts
in
a
way
that
minimizes
tensions
with
allies
because
you're
absolutely
right
to
suggest
that
torture
is
one
of
the
most
well-established
norms
of
international
law.
yet,
notwithstanding
that,
when
congress
addressed
the
issue
in
the
tvpa,
it
provided
specific
definitions
of
the
prohibited
conduct.
then
it
also
provided
clear
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
by
providing
for
a
specific
statute
of
limitations
of
10
years.
and
then,
as
i
also
indicated,
it...
it
put
in
a
specific
statutory
exhaustion
provision
which
suggested
that
litigants
shouldn't
rush
to
united
states
courts
if
the
courts
in
the
area
where
the
events
actually
took
place
are
open
for
the
claims.
i
think
that
last
provision
is
particularly
telling
because
it
shows
that
when
you
take
the
normal
course
and
insist
that
congress
get
involved
in
the
process
of
creating
causes
of
action,
congress
as
a
political
branch
with
foreign
affairs
responsibilities
of
its
own--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
there
certainly
are
international
jurists
that
will
argue
that
exhaustion
principles
are
a
principle
of
international
law.
but
i
think
that's
exactly
what
ends
up
happening
if
you
leave
these
issues
to
the
courts
and
don't
insist
on
a
cause
of
action
is
you
leave
the
courts
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
i
guess,
trying
to
interpret
international
law
sources
to
come
up
with
things
like
exhaustion.
a
statute
of
limitations
i
would
think
would
be
even
more
difficult.
principles
of
damages.
and
they're
supposed
to
do
all
of
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
lawmaking
with
the
only
guide
they
have
in
the
text
is
the
33
words
in
28
u.s.c.
1350
which,
by
their
terms,
really
only
address
jurisdiction.
so
i
think
that
would
put
the
courts
in
a
very
difficult
position,
and
i
think
in
contrast,
the
torture
victim
protection
act
shows
the
virtues
of
waiting
for
congress
to
take
some
action
before
somebody
would
get
involved
in
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes,
justice
kennedy,
and
thank
you.
let
me
start
with
the...
the
arrest
authority
question
because,
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
the
view
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
that
there
is
categorically
no
arrest
authority
abroad,
even
if
a
foreign
nation
consents.
and
that
really
cannot
be
correct.
and
i
think
respondent
recognizes
that
implicitly
by
not
defending
that
aspect
of
the
ninth
circuit
ruling,
but
rather
insisting
on
a
rule
that
would
give
arrest
authority
only
with
consent.
and
with
respect,
though,
i
think
that
is
not
a
workable
rule
for
the
federal
courts,
and
if
i
could
use,
by
way
of
example,
the
arrest
of
the
individual
who's
the
convicted
killer
in
the
cia
shooting,
mir
aimal
kasi.
this
is
an
individual
who
was
arrested
by
fbi
agents
in
pakistan
in
1997.
under
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
obviously,
this
individual
could
not
be
arrested
by
fbi
agents
as
a
categorical
matter.
but
under
the
approach
of
respondent,
the
federal
courts
would
have
to
inquire
into
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
arrest
and
to
inquire
specifically
into
whether
the
government
of
pakistan
consented
to
the
arrest
by
fbi
agents
in
pakistan
in
1997.
now,
i
think
the
prospects
for
interfering
with
sensitive
diplomatic
relations,
not
to
mention
the
difficulty
of
divining
any
principles
for
discerning
the
requisite
degree
of
consent,
are
manifest
in
both
those
cases,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
far
better
approach
is
to
read
section
878
of
title
21,
consistent
with
its
plain
terms,
to
give
the
dea
the
arrest
authority
for
any
felony
cognizable
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
without
reading
in
either
a
territorial
limitation
or
a
limitation
based
on
consent.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
actually
think
the
mansfield
amendment
supports
the
view
of
the
united
states
here,
and
indeed,
under
the
view
of
the
ninth
circuit,
it's
entirely
unclear
what
the
mansfield
amendment
was
supposed
to
accomplish.
it
was
under
their
view
limiting
an
authority
that
did
not
exist
because
what
the
mansfield
amendment
does
is
put
specific
limitations
on
the
authority
of
federal
agents.
it
applies
only
to
direct
arrests,
only
to
foreign
police
actions,
and
only
in
the
context
of
narcotics
control
efforts.
and
then
even
there
it
provides
specific
exceptions
for
exigencies
and
the
like.
and
so
i
think
what
that
reflects
is
that
there
may
be
circumstances
where
an
extraterritorial
arrest
authority
raises
concerns
and
congress
may
react
to
those,
as
it
did
in
the
mansfield
amendment,
but
the
very
fact
that
there
is
this
specific
and
tailored
limitation
on
dea
authority
suggests
that
there
must
be
some
broader
grant
of
authority
that
includes
extraterritorial
arrests.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
certainly...
that
is
one
way
you
could
read
it,
justice
souter.
and
i
think
there's
two
implications
from
that.
one
is,
of
course,
if
that's
the
way
you
read
it,
the
mansfield
amendment
certainly
doesn't
bar
the
action
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
but
here's
why
i
think
it
still
implies
something
about
the
scope
of
section
878
because
section
878
of
title
21
is
not
just
the
authority
for
the
dea
to
make
arrests,
it's
basically
the
source
of
all
their
statutory
authority
for
law
enforcement
efforts.
and
i
think
that
even
participation
in
the
midst
of
a
foreign
police
action,
as
you
were
envisioning
the
reference
in
the
mansfield
amendment,
is
at
least
a
law
enforcement
involvement
of
the
dea.
and
so
i
think
that
unless
878
authorizes
extraterritorial
actions
by
dea
agents,
be
it
arrests,
be
it
simply
carrying
a
firearm,
or
be
it
engaging
in
other
investigatory
activities,
then
so
too
i
think
the
language
of
the
mansfield
amendment,
even
if
it
limits
the
very
specific
kind
of
law
enforcement
activity
by
the
dea,
still
suggests
that
878
by
its
terms
is
not
strictly
limited
to
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
a
fair
point,
but
i
think
even
if
that's
a
bit
of
a
broad
conception,
i
certainly
think
assisting
in
the
context
of
a
foreign
police
action
should
qualify
as
law
enforcement.
if
i
could
say
just
a...
a
few
things
about
the
foreign
country
exemption
before
i
sit
down.
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
clear
error
in
the
analysis
of
the
ninth
circuit
because
this
is
really
a...
a
rare
case
where
you
have
an
arrest
that
is
false
and
tortious
only
because
it
occurred
in
mexico.
you
have
the
lower
courts
recognizing
that
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
damages
only
for
the
period
he
was
in
mexico,
and
every
element
of
the
tort
took
place
in
mexico.
yet,
nonetheless,
somehow
the
court
applies
this
headquarters
doctrine
to
say
that
the
foreign
country
exception
applies.
and
i
think
what
that
illustrates
is
that
although
the
headquarters
exception
may
have
been
a
helpful
gloss
on
the
language
of
the
statute
when
it
was
first
developed,
as
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
ninth
circuit,
it
becomes
a
free-floating
exception
to
the...
to
the
foreign
country
exception
that
allows
a
plaintiff
to
skirt
the
language
of
the
statute
simply
by
alleging
any
degree
of
u.s.
involvement
or
direction.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
could
first
address
the
argument
that
is
advanced
by
respondent
that
we
can
solve
the
extraterritorial
arrest
problem
by
simply
insisting
on
there
being
consent.
i
think
this
court
in
its
first
alvarez-machain
opinion
at
footnote
16
made
the
point
that
there
are
some
issues
that
are
best
dealt
with
in
diplomatic
relations
between
countries
and
not
in
the
courts
of
a
single
party.
and
i
think
consent
for
an
extraterritorial
arrest
is
a
prototypical
example
of
that.
in
diplomatic
relations
between
countries,
a
certain
amount
of
ambiguity
can
make
the
diplomatic
relation
function
and
so
there
may
be
varying
degrees
of
consent.
in
the
context
of
a
united
states
judicial
proceeding,
though,
the
tendency
is
to
bore
down
and
find
out
whether
there
was
some
modicum
of
consent,
some
legal
standard
of
consent.
and
i
would
point
again
to
the
example
of
mir
aimal
kasi
as
how
having
courts
bear
down
and
figure
out
the
exact
extent
of
consent
between
pakistan
and
fbi
agents
in
1997
would
not
have
been
a
productive
exercise
for
the
courts.
a
very
brief
note
on
the
ker
opinion,
ker
against
illinois
that
was
just
mentioned
at
the
closing
of
respondents'
argument.
it's
true
the
court
said
that
there
might
be
an
action
for
kidnapping
in
that
case,
but
this
court
did
not
opine
in
any
way
what
would
be
the
relevant
law
in
that
kidnapping
that
occurred
in
peru.
i
would
suggest
if
it
had
looked
at
that
issue,
it
would
have
suggested
that
the
law
that
applied
would
be
the
law
of
peru
in
the
same
way
that
if
there
is
any
law
that
applies
to
the
false
arrest
here,
it
is
the
law
of
mexico
and
that
only
underscores
that
this
arrest,
even
if
it
were
actionable
somehow,
would
fall
within
the
foreign
country
exemption
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
if
i
could
say
two
things
about
section
1350.
the...
first
of
all,
in
terms
of
trying
to
divine
exactly
what
was
in
congress'
mind
when
it
enacted
this
provision
in
1789,
i
would
say
that
that
is
exceedingly
difficult
and
that
strongly
suggests
that
what
the
court
should
do
is
simply
apply
its
rules
for
when
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
but
if
there
is
any
agreement
at
all
as
to
what
at
least
one
of
the
events
that
led
to
the
passage
of
the
statute
was,
it
was
the
events
involving
ambassadors
in
the
united
states
and
violations
and
assaults
on
those
ambassadors.
and
i
think
the
reaction
to
those
assaults
is
telling.
first,
there
were
no
civil
actions
ever
brought
in
the
courts
that
anybody
is
aware
of
to
remedy
those
actions.
what
were
brought
are
common
law
criminal
actions.
that's
what
the
longchamps
case
in
pennsylvania
was.
it
was
a
common
law
criminal
action.
now,
i
don't
think
anybody
would
suggest
that
a
common
law
criminal
action
in
law
of
nations
somehow
survives
this
court...
this
court's
decision
in
hudson,
saying
there's
no
longer
any
common
law
criminal
jurisdiction.
in
the
same
way,
to
the
extent
that
the
court...
the
congress
may
have
had
in
mind
some
general
common
law
action
that
was
available,
there's
no
particular
reason
why
that
decision
should
withstand
the
erie
decision.
but
again,
i
think
it
is
noteworthy
that
there
was
no
civil
action
in
response
to
those
incidents.
what
there
was
is
the
1781
continental
congress
action,
and
it
just
didn't
ask
the
court...
the
state
courts
to
do
something
about
this.
it
told
the
courts
to
authorize
actions.
the
one
court...
the
one
state
that
took
up
the
challenge
was
connecticut,
and
if
you
look
at
what
connecticut
did,
it
is
very
telling
because
first
they
put
in
a
jurisdictional
provision.
then
as
a
separate
provision,
they
used
language
that
is
rights-conferring
language.
it
seems
obvious
that
congress
with
section
1350
did
the
former
but
not
the
latter.
there
is
jurisdiction,
but
there
is
not
any
rights-creating
language.
now,
it
may
be
a
bit
anomalous
to
apply
this
court's
current
conception
to
an
old
statute
like
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
but
this
court
has
done
it
before.
thank
you.
