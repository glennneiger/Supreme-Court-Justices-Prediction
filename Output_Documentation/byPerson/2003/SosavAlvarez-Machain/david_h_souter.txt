justice
david
h.
souter
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1990,
a
federal
grand
jury
indicted
the
respondent
alvarez,
a
mexican
national,
to
his
role
in
the
torture
of
an
agent
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration.
after
failing
to
negotiate,
alvarez’s
extradition
from
mexico,
dea
official
hatched
a
plan
for
his
abduction
by
mexican
nationals
and
his
forceable
removable
of
the
united
states.
the
plan
was
followed
and
alvarez
was
brought
to
this
country
for
trial.
this
court
found
that
jurisdiction
was
proper
not
withstanding
the
circumstances
of
his
capture,
but
at
the
ensuing
trial
the
district
court
granted
alvarez’s
motion
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
he
then
began
the
civil
actions
which
are
before
us
now
seeking
damages
for
his
abduction
from
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
from
another
mexican
national,
sosa,
under
the
alien
tort
statute.
a
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
determined
that
alvarez
had
a
claim
for
relief
under
both
statutes
and
a
divided
en
banc
court
agreed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
as
to
withholding.
the
basis
for
alvarez’s
claim
under
the
tort
claims
act
is
his
seizure
in
one-day
detention
in
mexico
constituted
a
tortuous
false
arrest.
although
the
tort
claims
act
exempts
the
united
states
from
liability
for
“any
claim
arising
in
a
foreign
country”
the
ninth
circuit
avoided
application
of
this
foreign
country
exception
by
relying
on
the
so-called
headquarters
doctrine
according
to
which
torts
even
if
committed
abroad
maybe
actionable
under
the
tort
claims
act
if
they
were
planned
and
orchestrated
domestically.
we
reject
that
analysis
and
reverse
on
that
basis.
we
have
previously
held
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
foreign
country
exception
demonstrate
that
congress
meant
to
avoid
exposing
the
united
states
to
tort
liability
based
on
the
application
of
foreign
law.
at
the
time
the
tort
claims
act
was
passed,
the
courts
would
have
applied
foreign
law
in
any
tort
case
where
the
injury
or
harm
occurred
in
a
foreign
country.
we
thus,
read
the
exception
to
apply
when
the
injury
complained
or
took
place
abroad.
applying
the
headquarters
doctrine
in
a
case
under
the
tort
claims
act
is
a
judge
made
attempt
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
the
statutory
directive
and
we
reject
it.
alvarez,
as
i
said,
also
sued
sosa
under
the
alien
tort
statute
which
was
originally
passed
as
part
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789.
this
act
vests
federal
district
courts
with
jurisdiction
over
tort
suits
by
aliens
alleging
violation
of
the
laws
of
nations.
and
although
it
was
effectively
dormant
for
about
200
years,
the
statute
has
enjoyed
somewhat
of
a
renaissance
since
the
second
circuit's
filartiga
case
in
1980.
the
parties
and
the
friends
of
the
court
take
vastly
disparate
positions
on
the
historic
and
present
significance
of
the
statute.
with
sosa
and
the
united
states
on
one
side
arguing
that
it
is
no
more
than
a
jurisdictional
grant
unable
to
support
a
cause
of
action
in
the
absence
of
further
legislation,
and
with
alvarez
believing
that
the
act
itself
is
the
source
of
a
substantive
cause
of
action.
although
we
agree
with
sosa
that
the
statute
is
jurisdictional,
we
recognize
that
at
the
time
of
its
enactment,
a
modest
set
of
private
claims
under
the
law
of
nations
would
have
been
actionable
as
part
of
the
general
common
law.
taking
our
cue
from
history,
we
believe
that
the
alien
tort
statute
is
still
properly
understood
to
furnish
jurisdiction
for
a
narrow
band
of
international
law
acclaims.
we
say
narrow
because
there
are
many
reasons
for
judicial
caution
in
recognizing
such
claims.
these
reasons
include
a
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
federal
courts
to
make
common
law,
judicial
hesitation
to
infer
causes
of
action
where
they
are
not
expressly
provided
by
statute,
and
a
healthy
skepticism
about
the
judicial
role
in
foreign
affairs.
the
stringent
statute
set
out
in
the
opinion
is
fatal
to
alvarez’s
claim
here.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
the
chief
justice
and

thomas

justice
