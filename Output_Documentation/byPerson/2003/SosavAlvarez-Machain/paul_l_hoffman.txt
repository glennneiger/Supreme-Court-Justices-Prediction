mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
start
with
the
meaning
of
the
alien
tort
statute.
it's
our
position,
as
you
know
from
the
briefs,
that...
that
congress
meant
what
it
said,
that
congress
actually
decided
in
1789
to
pass
a
statute
that
allowed
aliens
that
had
tort
claims
that...
involving
the
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
to
bring
them
in
federal
court,
and
that
by
using
the
word
tort,
what
the...
the
founding
fathers
were
referring
to
was
a
body
of
common
law
that
was
well
known
to
be
part
of
the
law
in
the
united
states
during
the
colonial
days
and
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i'm
sorry.
i
said
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
that
the...
the
kinds
of
law
of...
law
of
nations
violations
at
the
time
would
have
included
piracy,
which
clearly...
in
terms
of
another
country,
i
mean,
it's
certainly
possible
that
a...
an
assault
on
an
ambassador
could
have
taken
place
in
another
country.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
the
ones
that
they
were
most
concerned
about
was
the
1784
marbois
incident
and
the
one
in
1788,
the
dutch
ambassador
in
new
york
city,
were
the
ones
most
on
their
mind.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
that's
not
entirely
clear,
i
mean,
because
if
there
was
a...
one
of
the
things
that
was
before
them
was
the
transitory
tort
doctrine.
and
the
transitory
tort
doctrine,
which
this
court
has
recognized
dates
back
at
least
as...
as
far
as
mostyn
v.
fabrigas,
which
is
a
1774
lord
mansfield
opinion,
which
involves
ironically
a
false
imprisonment
claim
against
a
government
official
which
took
place
outside
the
territory
of
england
and
which
was
found
to
be
cognizable
in
common
law
tort
within
the...
the
courts
of
england.
and
so
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--excuse
me?
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no,
of
course,
not.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no.
and
in
fact,
i
think
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
the
alien
tort
statute
was
to
provide
a
federal
forum
for
those
claims
when
they
came
within
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
certainly
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
one
of
the...
one
of
the...
first
of
all,
longchamps
is
one
response
to
that
in
the
sense
that
in
pennsylvania
they
didn't
need
a
statute.
they
didn't
pass
a
statute
and...
and
the...
the
courts
in
pennsylvania
understood
that
the
law
of
nations
was
part
of
their
common
law.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no.
i
think
what...
what...
the
way
we
would
interpret
the
1781
resolution
is
that
the
1781
resolution
was
more
a
function
of
the
continental
congress'
inability
to
enforce
the
law
of
nations
on
behalf
of
the
nation
under
the
articles
of
confederation.
and
so
they
had
no
way
to
respond
to
any
incident,
including
the
marbois
incident
after
that
resolution.
now,
they
did--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
what
they
did
is
they
asked
the...
the
states
to
enforce
the
law
of
nations.
and
connecticut
passed
that
particular
statute
in
order
to
do
it.
other
states
did
not
act
in
response
to
that,
but
that's
not
to
suggest
that
they
didn't
decide
that
they
already
had
adequate
remedies.
moreover,
the
resolution
did
more
than
just
ask
the
states
to
enforce
the
law
of
nations.
it
also
provided
a
new...
which
was
not
a
common
law
thing...
an
indemnity
for
the
united
states
if
the
united
states
had
to
do
something
to
take
up
the
slack
for
the
states.
and
so
from
our
standpoint,
what...
what
the...
the
1781
resolution
really
does
is
that
is
the...
the
step
is
from
1781,
feeling
completely
frustrated
and
not
able
to
enforce
the
law
of
nations,
coming
to
the
constitution
where
there's
lots
of
evidence
that
the
founding
fathers
believed
that
we
had
to
as
a
nation
enforce
the
law
of
nations,
having
incidents
like
the
marbois
incident
and
the...
the
attack
on
the
ambassador
in
new
york
right
before
them,
deciding
in
the
alien
tort
statute
to
make
those
claims
available.
now,
what...
what
the
government
and...
and
petitioner
sosa
want
the
court
to
believe
is
that
having
gone
through
the
trouble
of
expressing
to
the
world,
to
the
people,
in
terms
of
the...
that...
that
we
would
as
a
nation
enforce
the
law
of
nations,
that
then
the
congress
just
didn't
do
it
because
basically
congress
didn't
do
anything
else
to
enforce
the
torts
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
clause
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
there
are
two...
i
have
two
responses,
justice
scalia,
to
that
question.
on
the
first
one,
in
terms
of
whether
the
law
of
nations
is
too
indeterminate...
boundless
i
think
is
the
word
that's
used
in
the
petitioner's
brief...
this
court
has
affirmed
at
least
in...
on
two
occasions
that
i'm
aware
of,
in
u.s.
v.
smith
and
in
ex
parte
quirin,
the
fact
that
congress
can
easily
by
reference
incorporate
the
law
of
nations
and
that
it
is
not
indeterminate
enough
to
justify
a
death
sentence
in
the...
against
the
pirate
in
the
united
states
v.
smith
in
1820
and
120-some-odd
years
later
against
nazi
saboteurs
in
ex
parte
quirin.
the
court...
it
is
perfectly
permissible
for
the
congress,
particularly
in
1789,
to
incorporate
by
reference
what
lawyers
at
that
time
knew
to
be
the
law
of
nations.
it's
not...
congress
doesn't
have
to
exercise
its--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
in
the...
in
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
but
actually
i
think
that
that
is...
would
not
be
a
correct
view
of...
either
of
what
the
courts
did
or
what
the
courts
ought
to
do.
in
fact,
there
are
a
relative
handful
of
cases
under
the
alien
tort
statute
in
the
last
25
years
in
which
there
have
been
findings
about
violations
of
the
law
of
nations.
they
have
tended
overall
to
involve
claims
of
torture,
genocide,
war
crimes,
crimes
against
humanity,
clearly
norms
that
the
united
states
has
supported
from
nuremberg
on
down.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
you're
right,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
that
is
not
my
case.
but
my
argument
about
why
this
is
arbitrary
arrest
and
detention
is,
number
one,
there
is
a
core
arbitrary
arrest
and
detention
norm
that
an...
that
an
arrest
and
detention
can't
happen
without
legal
authority.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
he
was
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
and
there
was
an
arrest
warrant
that
was
limited
to
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
there
was
no
authority
to
arrest
him
in
mexico.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
that
the...
the
distinction...
and...
and...
that
needs
to
be
made
on
that
is
that
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
was
aware,
as
we
all
are
aware,
that
the
drug
enforcement
administration
has
involved
in
activities
in
other
countries
of
a
variety
of
activities.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
they're
supportive.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
that's--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--the...
the...
i
hope
to
persuade
you
otherwise
on
that
point.
but
the...
the
distinction
i
would
draw,
first
of
all,
is
that
the
fact
that
the
dea
is
involved
in
some
activities
abroad
doesn't
mean
that
congress
intended
that
any
dea
officer
or
employee
had
worldwide
arrest
authority
at
their
discretion.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
sure.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
bowman...
bowman
was
about
jurisdiction
to
proscribe.
and
i
think
the...
the
government
relies
on
maul
as
the
case
for...
on
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce.
and...
and
the
maul
case
is
very
interesting
actually
because
what
it
does
is
it
says
that
the
coast
guard
can
be
engaged
in
activities
on
the
high
seas
which
are
extraterritorial,
but
they're
not
within
the
territory
of
another
state.
and
in
fact,
the...
the
language
in
maul
is
very
clear
to
talk
about
the
law
of
nations
and
the
restrictions
on
the
ability
of
the
coast
guard
to
do
things.
they
say
they're
not
at
issue
in
that
case
because
the
high
seas
is
a
place
where
that
kind
of
authority
can
be
maintained
without
any
conflict
with
any
other
nation
or
without
any
conflict
with...
with
the
law
of
nations.
what
they...
they
were
also
dealing
with
a
u.s.
ship
and
a...
and
a
u.s.
citizen,
and
so
there
was
no
even
issue
about
whether
they
had
the
authority
on
the
high
seas
to
seize
a
foreign-flagged
ship.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
don't
think
that
it...
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
don't
think
that
it
follows
that...
that
you
have
to
assume
that
congress
intended
that...
that
entire
statute
had
to
have
complete
extraterritorial
effect.
now,
but
there's
an
additional
principle
other
than
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality,
which
would
slice
it
one
way
or
the
other
perhaps,
although
i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
is
that
we're
talking
about
extraterritorial
arrest
here
and
that
provision
and
whether
that's
extraterritorial
both
in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
background
of
the
statute,
the
background
of...
of
cooperative
activities,
not
activities
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations,
but--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
think
that
the
difference
would
be
that
the
congress...
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
government
is
making,
because
they
don't...
there's
nothing
in
the...
in
the
statute
that
tells
you
that
arrest
authority
is
extraterritorial
either.
it
doesn't
say
anything.
it's
boiler
plate
authorization
language.
right?
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
and...
and
under
the
government's
theory,
in
fact
in
their
reply
brief,
they
say
that
the
citizens
arrest
statute
in
california
is
the
same
to
section
878,
which
means
that
36
million
people
in...
in
the
state
of
california
can
engage
in
extraterritorial
arrests
too.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
and
so
there
has...
there
have
to
be
some
other
limitations
and
some
other
inquiries--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
let
me...
the...
the
other
limitation...
the
other...
well,
there
are
two
really.
one
is
the
mansfield
amendment,
which
we
have
laid
out
in
our
brief.
and
basically
our
position
is
that
what
the
mansfield
amendment
means
is
that
the
dea
was
specifically--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--but
in
the...
on
the
government's
theory--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--but
in
the
government's
theory,
what
that
would
mean
is
that
if...
if
the
government
wanted
to
arrest
a
drug
trafficker
in
mexico
and
they...
they
would
be
barred
by
the
mansfield
amendment
from
actually
being
involved
in
that
arrest,
even
participating
in
it
unless
the
ambassador
to
mexico
approved
it
under
the...
the
rules,
but
under
their
theory,
they
could
actually
hire
the
people
that
they
hired
in
this
case
to
arrest
the
trafficker.
now,
i
don't...
that's...
but
that's
what
they're
saying.
and
i...
i--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i...
direct...
what...
what
happened
in
this
case
was
certainly
directly
effecting
the
arrest.
what
the...
what
the
dea
officials
in
this
case
did
is
they
directed
that
he
be
arrested.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i...
i
think
what
the...
what
the
difference--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--but
i
think
what
the
difference
was
is
the
mansfield
amendment
was
broader
than
just
arresting.
the
mansfield
amendment
came
out
of
a
trip
that
senator
mansfield
took
to
thailand
where
he
was
concerned
about
the...
the
fact
that
dea
agents
were...
were
even
in
any
operations
with
foreign
law
enforcement
and
they...
he
thought
that
that
caused
problems
to
our
foreign
relations
and...
and
the
exercise
of
law
enforcement
authority
in
other
countries.
now,
that
was--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
but
the
thing
is
from
our
standpoint,
i
mean,
this
is
a
foreign...
this...
this
is
a
police
action
in
a
foreign
country.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
really
think
that...
that
the...
the
intent
of
the
mansfield
amendment
was
not
to
allow
dea
agents
to
get
involved
in
arrests
that
caused
problems
for
our
foreign
relations.
and
that's
exactly
what
this
arrest
did.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
the
other...
the
other
principle,
though,
which
i
think
is
the
one
that...
that
i
think
clearly
applies
to
this
case
is...
is
the
principle
that
statutes
need
to
be
interpreted
to
be
consistent
with
our
international
law
obligations,
the
charming
betsy
principle.
and...
and
there,
even
in
the
maul
case,
the...
the
maul
court
was
certainly
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
were
limits
in
the
international
law
about
the
ability
to
enforce
our
law
extraterritorially.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
that
was
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--this
was
it.
the
charming
betsy
is
number
two.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
sorry.
but...
but
that's
the
other
principle,
and
i...
i
think
the
one
that...
that
probably
is
most
applicable
to
the
situation
is
the
principle
that
you
should
presume
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
authorize
violations
of
international
law,
which
is
what
occurred
in
this
case.
and
whether
that's--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
that
the...
the
first...
in
terms
of
the
alien
tort
claims
act,
which
i
think
is
where
the
south
africa
example
is
coming
from
mostly,
i
think
that
the...
there...
there
are
several
limitations
that
are
inherent
in
the
jurisprudence.
one
is
that
it's
very
difficult
to
find
a
customary
international
law
norm,
and
it's
not...
it
wasn't
even
easy
in
this
case.
in
fact,
if
there
was...
if
the
president
authorized
this
kidnapping,
there's
no
claim.
i
should
get
that
out
of
the
way.
there's
no
claim
under...
under
the
alien
tort
claims
act.
there's
no
claim
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
if
the
president
and
probably
if
the
attorney
general
said
it
is
in
the...
america's
interest
to
kidnap
this
person
and
bring
him
to
justice,
i
don't
have
a
claim.
but
the
reason
i
have
a
claim--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--is
that
the
president
didn't
do
that.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
no.
it...
it's
actually
not.
i
mean,
what
the...
what
the
nereide
said
or
what
this
court
said
in
the
nereide
is
until
there's
an
act,
the
courts
will
enforce
the
law
of
nations.
in
the
paquete
habana,
what
the
court
said
was
we
will
enforce
the
law
of
nations,
even
against
the
military,
for
violations
for
the
law...
laws
of
war
unless
the
president...
unless
there's
a
controlling
executive,
legislative,
or
judicial
act.
and
so
if
the
president
takes
a
controlling
executive
act,
that's
it.
it
might
still
be
a
violation
of
international
law,
but...
but
under
this
court's--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
although--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i...
i
think
that
that
it
probably
is
the
case
that
it
goes
down
to
the
president
and
his
cabinet.
in
the
paquete
habana,
this
court
decided
that
the
decision
of
an
admiral
who
was
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
the
blockade
of
cuba
during
the
spanishamerican
war
acted
in
violation
of
customary
international
law
by
seizing
two
fishing
boats.
those
fishing
boats
were
returned.
well,
they
were
actually
sold.
there
were
damages
issued
based
on
customary
law
by...
by
this
court
for
the
violation
of
the
law
of
nations.
and...
and
in...
in
that
case,
you
had
a
situation
where
the
dissenters
and
the
government
said
this
is
a
political
question.
you...
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
decide
this.
the
court
said,
no,
we
can
decide
the
law
of
nations.
we
can
find
the
law
of
nations.
we
can
even
find
that
the
law
of
nations
has
evolved
so
that
the
way
that
fishing
vessels
were
treated
during
the
napoleonic
wars
might
have
been
a
matter
of
comity,
but
by
the
spanish-american
war,
they
had
ripened
into
customary
law,
which
we
can
find
through
the
methods
that
have
been
employed
by
the
courts
of
this
country
since
the
very
beginning
of
the
republic
and
before
the
republic
was
created.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
oh,
no.
we
have
an
entire
section,
your
honor,
in
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--yes,
and
it's
actually
in
the
brief
in...
in
485,
and
it
is
the
entire
section--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--it's...
it's
section
i(c)
from
pages
17
through
i
believe
28.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
and...
and
the
importance
of
that
principle
in
this
case
is
that...
the...
the
government
wants
you
to
read
authorizing
statutes
as
saying
that
any
law
enforcement
agent,
employee,
or
official
by
just
having
a
general
arrest
authority,
automatically
has
arrest
authority
over
the
world.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history.
there's
nothing
in
any
history
that
says
that
congress
even
had
the
slightest
thought
that
they
were
authorizing
worldwide
jurisdiction
in
the
territory
of
other
sovereign
states
by
passing
this
general
enactment.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
we...
we
accept--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
that...
that
may
be
the...
on
the
presumption
of
extraterritoriality
and
the
way
that--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--that
the
ninth
circuit
read
it.
under
the
charming
betsy
principle,
what
our
principle
is
is
the
one...
we
adopt
what
the...
what
the
united
states
adopts
as
the
principle
of
international
law,
which
was
laid
out
in
judge
sofaer's
opinion
in
march
1980
through
the
office
of
legal
counsel
which
basically
said
on
a
review
of
all
the
international
authorities,
they
found
that
it
was
a
violation
of
international
law
to
forcibly
abduct
somebody
from
another
country
if
that
country
protested.
the
protest
actually
eliminates
the
problems
that
the
government
is
talking
about
in
terms
of
finding
consent
and
whether
there's
another
government
that's
recognized,
all
those
things,
because
what
judge
sofaer
said
in
the
opinion
was
that
acquiescence
equals
consent.
the...
if
a
foreign
government
wants
to
assert
that
limit
on...
on
u.s.
law
enforcement
authority
under
international
law,
it
had
better
make
a
protest,
as
mexico
did
in
this
case.
and
one
of
the
reasons
this
is
such
an
unusual
case
is
that
you
just
don't
find
many
situations
where
there
has
been
any
kind
of
extraterritorial
law
enforcement
where
there
has
been
a
sovereign
protest.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
completely
agree
with
that.
there's
no
question.
there
has
never
been
in
the
case
that...
that
the
statute
under
which
dr.
alvarez
was
tried
was
extraterritorial.
there's
no
question
in...
in
my
mind,
i
don't
think
anybody's
mind,
that
the
united
states
in
making
that
statute
extraterritorial
was
acting
consistent
with
its
international
obligations.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
there
is
a
difference
between
the
jurisdiction
to
proscribe
within
international
law
and...
and
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
those
laws.
what
the...
what
the
government
says
is
that
if
you
don't
give
us
this
authority,
unlimited,
anybody...
it
might
even
be
the
forest
service
that
could
do
it
because
they
might
have
the
same
statute...
that...
that
it's
either
that
or
war.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
for
one
thing,
the...
the
court...
the
court
below
cut
off
damages.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
certainly
not
under
the
rule
below,
and
i
think--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--what's
the
right
rule?
you
know,
theoretically
i
suppose
that
if
you
are
imprisoning
somebody
in
violation
of
international
law,
you
should
have
a
remedy
that
responds
to
that
and
that's--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--right.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
apologize
for
not
completing
my
answer.
but
i
started
with
the
idea
that
there
were
a
limited
number
of
norms,
but
there's
more
to
that.
there's,
of
course,
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
and
so--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
it--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--what--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
that
the...
first
of
all,
particularly
in
the
corporate
realm,
there
has
not
been
a
judgment
yet
against
a
corporation
in
an
alien
tort
statute
case.
there
just
hasn't.
and
many
of
them
have
been
dismissed.
some
have
been
dismissed
on
the
political
question
doctrine.
we've
mentioned
some
in
our
brief.
where
there
is
a
conflict
between
this
country's
foreign
policy
and
the
progress
of
the
lawsuit,
at
least
in
some
circumstances,
the
case
can
be
dismissed
on
political
question
grounds.
on
some
other
cases,
it...
it
will
be
dismissed
on
act
of
state
grounds.
the...
the
one
pertinent
limitation...
and...
and
it's
actually
been
raised
by
the
other
side...
is
exhaustion
of
local
remedies.
and...
and
what...
what...
the
answer
you
got
on
exhaustion
of
local
remedies
was
some
theorists
think
that
that's
part
of
international
law.
it
is
part
of
international
law.
in
fact,
in
a
lot
of
the
early
alien
tort
statute
cases,
defendants
did
raise
exhaustion
of
local
remedies.
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
hasn't
been
a
big
issue
is
that
a
lot
of
the
people
that
are
coming
to
this
country
to
vindicate
their
human
rights
are
refugees
that
have
fled
from
places
like
burma
or
revolutionary
ethiopia
or
other
places
that
have
no
legal
system
and
could
not
possibly
give
a
local
remedy.
now,
that
won't
be
the
case
for...
for
cases
that
arise
in
other
contexts
where
there
is.
and
i
think
the
courts
can
dismiss
based
on
exhaustion
of
local
remedies
where
there
are
remedies
to
be
done,
and
that
is
not
something
that...
the...
the
court
would
apply
that
as
part
of...
of
international
law,
as
part
of
the
law
of
nations
because
it
is
part
of
the
law
of
nations.
and
so
the
tvpa
actually
took
the
lead
from
the
alien
tort
statute
in
having
an
exhaustion
of
local
remedies
issue,
and
i
think
that
a
lot
of
the...
the
issues
about
separation
of
powers
and...
and
the...
the
parade
horribles
about
what
might
happen
because
of
these
cases,
this
is--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--excuse
me?
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
no,
actually
because
i
don't...
we...
we
can't
get
a
remedy
in
mexico
against--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--we
certainly
can't
get
a
remedy
in
mexico
against
mr.
sosa.
mr.
sosa
is
here,
and
the
united
states
is
here.
and
what
remedy
would
he
get
in
a
mexican
court
if
he
can't...
this
is
a
transitory
tort.
i
mean,
this
is
the
kind
of
transitory
tort
that
would
have
been
well
understood
by
lord
mansfield,
false
imprisonment.
that
was--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--we
could
sue
him
here
in
the
state
court.
he
has
a
state
cause
of
action.
and
in
fact,
one
of
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--where
do
we
get...
where
do
we
get
jurisdiction
over
him?
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
we
don't
have
personal
jurisdiction
over--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
for...
we
have
now
been
litigating
the
case,
as
you
know,
since...
for
12
years,
and
the
exhaustion
of...
of
local
remedies
has
not
come
up
as
a
defense.
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
defense
that
the
defendant
would
have
to--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--but--
[laughter]
i...
i
think...
i
think
it
is
and
it
has
been
raised.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
think--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
guess
the
question...
the
question
is
from
our
standpoint
the...
the
founders
wanted
to
enforce
the
law
of
nations.
what's
changed
is
that
the
law
of
nations
has
changed.
since
nuremberg,
there's
an
international
law
of
human
rights.
some...
some
rights
within
that
have
ripened
into
customary
law.
and
so
the
reason
you
have
more
cases
is
that
you
have
a
different
world
than
you
had
in
1789.
that's
really
what
has
changed.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
it...
i
think
it
is.
and
in
fact,
a
justice
of
this
court
started
it.
i
mean,
it's
the
nuremberg
principle
that
individuals
can
be
responsible
for
the
violation
of
international
human
rights.
and
what
the...
what
the
alien
tort
statute
has
done
is
provide
a
forum
for
people
who
have
suffered
terrible
human
rights
violations
in
general
in
these
cases
to
come
here
and
have
their
rights
adjudicated
when
they
find
the
defendant
here.
so
when
one
of
my
clients
met
her
torturer
at
a
hotel
in
atlanta,
georgia,
she
was
able
to
go
to
a
court
and...
and
get
a
remedy
for
her
torture
because
her
torturer
was
here
and
she
was
here.
and
that's
the...
that's
a
paradigm
of
what...
what
this
law
has
been--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
would
have
two...
two
responses
really.
one
is
that
the
universal
jurisdiction
principle
is
primarily
a
principle
of
the
assertion
of
criminal
jurisdiction
for
certain
international
crimes.
and
so
i
don't
think
that
it
fits
very
well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--that's
true.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no,
that's
true.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
that's
true,
and
there
are
differences
in
domestic
statutes
around
the
world
in
terms
of...
of
enforcement
of
these
kinds
of
human
rights.
i
mean,
they're
incorporated
in
various
ways.
there
are
universal
jurisdictions
that...
statutes
that
apply
to
some
but
not
all
of
these
claims.
i
think
that
the...
the...
our...
our
objection
to
that
would
be
that
it
would
be
trying
to...
to
find
a
limit
that's
really
not
in
the
statute
and
really
is
a...
a
function,
we
think,
for
congress
to
decide.
congress...
there
was
a
question
before,
has
anybody...
has
there
ever
been
an...
an
attempt
to
change
the
alien
tort
statute?
as
far
as
we
know,
there
has
never
been
a
bill
in
congress
to
ask
for
any
change.
in
fact,
the
administration
in
the
filartiga
case
and
in
kadic
later
basically
said...
in
filartiga,
they
said
it
would
be
a
problem
for
our
foreign
relations
if
we
refused
to
recognize
a
remedy
in
this
kind
of
case.
and
in
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
it
is
very
clear
in
the
senate
and
house
reports,
as
clear
as
i
think
congress
could
possibly
be,
that
congress
liked
the
development
in
filartiga
case.
congress
rejected
the
arguments
that
are
being
made
to
you
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
explicitly
with
reference
to
judge
bork's
opinion
in
tel-oren,
and
saw
none
of
these
problems
with
the
enforcement
of
the
alien
tort
statute.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think...
well,
that's
because
of
when
1350
was
drafted.
but
i
think
that
the...
i
think
that
those
problems
are
not
as
insurmountable
as
they're
made
out
to
be.
i
think
the
courts
have
been
able
to
deal
with
those
problems
in
the
way
that
courts
have
dealt
with
them
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
i
mean,
section
1983,
for
example,
doesn't
provide
a
lot
of
those
things
either,
and
courts
have
been
able
to
fashion
the
rules
that
would
govern
those
kinds
of
cases--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
and
you
have...
you
have
in
section
1988
a...
a
reference
to
state
law,
and
this
court
has
often
had
reference
to
state
law
and
sometimes
it's
had
reference
to
rules
that
are
based
on...
on
different
reasons.
but
the...
the
courts...
i
mean,
for
example,
in
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
alien
tort
claims
act
was...
was
shorter
before
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
and
since
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
the
courts
have
applied
the
statute
of
limitations
that
congress
believes
is
appropriate
to
those...
to
those
cases.
so
i...
i
want
to...
i
know
i
still
don't
answer
your...
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
question.
and
then
my...
my...
our
feeling
about
that
is
that
those
kinds
of
policy
choices,
where
there
are
differences
of
opinion
even
between
administrations
about
how
this
should
be...
i
mean,
that's
clear.
some
administrations
think
this
is
a
great
way
to
proclaim
to
the
world
our
commitment
to
the
law
of
nations.
our
feeling
is
that
is
completely
consistent
with
what
the
founders
thought
about
the
law
of
nations
too.
they
were
proclaiming
their
commitment
to
the
law
of
nations
and
the
alien
tort
statute
does
that
in
the
international
human
rights
field
today.
we
have
said
that
around
the
world
and...
and
it
is
true.
if
there
need
to
be
modifications
to
it,
congress
can
modify
it.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
even
in...
with
respect
to
particular
norms,
because
this
is
enforcing
the
law
of
nations
and
because
it
can
be
displaced
by...
by
controlling
executive
decisions,
we're
protected.
there's
no
norm
that's
been
enforced
that
the
united
states
disagrees
with.
there's
a
disagreement
in
this--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--right.
well,
i
think
there
are
two
different...
there...
there
are
two
different
issues
there
i
think.
one
is
if
the
treaty...
if
the
united
states
in
the
treaty
has
issued
a
reservation
to
the
norm,
then
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it's
enforceable.
i
think
there's
a
reservation,
we
don't
accept
that
norm.
i
think
the...
the
difference
with
the
non-self-executing
declaration
is
that
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
don't
accept
the
norms.
the
non-self-executing
declaration
is...
is
we
might
or
we
might
not.
i
mean,
it
could
be
evidence
and
it
might
be
something
that
would
be
looked
at
by
a
court,
but
the...
what...
what...
because
article
vi
of
the
constitution
says
that
treaties
are
the
law
of
the
land
and
shall
be
enforced,
including
by
the
courts
of
the...
of
the
states,
if
the
united
states
entered
into
human
rights
treaties
without
that
reservation,
then
many
norms
which
are
not
customary
norms...
in
the...
in
the
international
covenant
on
civil
and
political
rights,
there
are
probably
a
handful
of
norms
that
would
be
accepted
as
being
customary
norms
and
many
that
would
go
beyond
anything
that
people
would
argue
as
customary.
so
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--the
courts.
the
courts
can
decide
this.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
the
courts
have
always
decided
this
kind
of
thing.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no.
if
there's
a
division
of
opinion,
as
this
court
said
in
sabbattino...
and
in
fact,
in
sabbattino,
the
united
states
government
came
into
the
court
and
said,
you
should
decide
this
case
because
we
think
the
law
is...
there's
a
violation
of
international
law
here.
and
the
court
decided,
no.
there's
a
diversity
of
opinion
and...
and
the
act
of
state
doctrine
precludes
us
from
issuing
an
opinion
in
that.
and
so
where
there
is
a
genuine
diversity
of
opinion...
and
i
would
say
we
have
cited
several
cases
like
the
flores
case
which
rejects
arguments
based
on
environmental
torts.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
have
brought
business
kinds
of
torts
that...
that
have
just
been
thrown
out
of
court.
and...
and
i
think
that
the...
the
courts
have
done--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
don't...
that
would
not
be
what
i
would
view
it
as.
i
think
what...
what
justice
harlan
said
was
there...
there
was
diverse
opinion
within
the
world
about
the
violation
of
law.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
my
point
i
guess
would
be,
though,
that
where
there
is
diversity
among
nations
or
about
the
norm,
then
i
don't
think
they
can
be
forced...
enforced
within
the
alien
tort
statute.
and
i
think
that
in
the
south
africa
case,
for
example,
i
mean,
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
that
would
be
dismissed.
it's...
i
think
there's
a
motion
to
dismiss
pending,
and
it
may
be
that...
that
that's
the
kind
of
case
that
ought
not
to
be
in
the
courts.
i
don't
know
much
about
the
details
of
it,
so
it's
very
hard
to
make
that
kind
of
comment.
but
you
know,
i
think
that
there
are...
there
are
doctrines
that
the
court
has,
both
domestically
and
internationally,
to
make
sure
that
these
problems
don't
become
the
kind
of
problems
that
are
there.
and
if
they
are
problems,
they
can
be
remedied.
they
can
be
remedied
by
congress.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
where...
that's
where
the
decision
should
be
made.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
and
the...
the
closing
remark
i...
i
would
make
really
is
that
in...
in
ker
v.
illinois
in
1886,
this
court
denied
a
remedy
to
someone
who
had
been
kidnapped
from
another
country
and
said
that
he
could
be
tried
notwithstanding
that
violation.
the
court
also
said
that
that
person
would
not
be
without
a
remedy,
that
all
that
person
had
to
do
was
bring
a
suit
for
trespass
and
false
arrest,
and
the
court
was
sure
that
that
statement
would
provide
a
remedy
in
the
courts.
after
dr.
alvarez's
acquittal,
he
took
up
the
court
on
that
suggestion
that
he
might
get
a
remedy
under
the
statutes
that
congress
has...
where
congress
has
authorized
the
courts
to
provide
redress
for...
for
those
kinds
of
torts
and
for
those
kinds
of
violations
of
the
law
of
nations.
and
to...
all
that
we
are
asking
from
this
court
and
all
we
asked
in
the
courts
below
is
that
the
courts
perform
the
kinds
of
functions
that
courts
have
performed
for
hundreds
of
years
before
the
republic,
all
during
the
republic
in
providing
a
damage
remedy
for
the
violation
of
personal
rights.
and
upholding
the
modest
judgment
in
this
case
is
not
going
to
undermine
our
national
security.
it
will
only
affirm
the
values
that
have
made
the...
the
country
as
great
as
it
is.
thank
you
very
much.
