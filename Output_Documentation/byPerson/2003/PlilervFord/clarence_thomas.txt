justice
clarence
thomas
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
pliler
v.
ford,
no.
03-221.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
filed
two
pro
se
“mixed”
federal
habeas
petitions,
those
containing
both
exhausted
and
unexhausted
claims.
claims
on
collateral
review,
normally
in
this
case
would
have
to
go
through
state
court
first,
and
they
are
exhausted
after
they
have
gone
through
state
court
the
relevant
proceedings,
and
they
are
unexhausted
if
they
have
not.
there
were
claims
that
contained
both
exhausted
and
unexhausted
claims,
and
he
filed
motions
to
stay
the
petitions
while
it
returned
to
state
court
to
exhaust
the
unexhausted
claims.
the
magistrate
judge
gave
him
three
options:
one,
the
petitions
could
be
dismissed
without
prejudice
and
respondent
could
re-file
after
exhausting
the
unexhausted
claims;
two,
the
unexhausted
claims
could
be
dismissed
and
he
could
proceed
with
only
the
exhausted
claims;
or
three,
he
could
contest
the
finding
that
some
claims
were
not
exhausted.
with
respect
to
the
first
petition
he
chose
the
first
option;
with
respect
to
the
second,
he
did
not
respond.
the
district
court
dismissed
both
petitions
without
prejudice.
after
his
habeas
petitions
in
the
california
supreme
court
were
denied,
respondent
filed
in
federal
court.
the
district
court
dismissed
both
petitions
with
prejudice,
as
untimely
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996
aedpa.
a
divided
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
initial
petitions
were
timely
and
that
the
later
petitions
related
back
to
the
initial
ones.
it
also
held
that
if
a
pro
se
prisoner
files
a
“mixed”
petition,
the
district
court
must
give
two
warnings:
first,
that
it
would
not
have
the
power
to
consider
a
prisoner’s
motions
to
stay
the
mixed
petitions,
unless
he
opted
to
amend
them
and
dismiss
the
then
unexhausted
claims;
and
second,
if
applicable,
that
a
prisoner’s
federal
claims
would
be
time
barred
absent
cause
for
equitable
tolling
upon
his
return
to
federal
court,
if
he
opted
to
dismiss
the
petitions
without
prejudice
and
return
to
state
court
to
exhaust
all
of
the
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
we
hold
that
federal
district
judges
are
not
required
to
give
pro
se
litigants
the
two
warnings
directed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
district
judges
have
no
obligation
to
act
as
counsel
or
paralegal
to
pro
se
litigants.
explaining
the
details
of
federal
habeas
procedure
and
calculating
statutes
of
limitations
are
task
normally
and
properly
performed
by
trained
counsel
as
a
matter
of
course.
requiring
district
courts
to
advice
a
pro
se
litigant
in
such
a
manner
would
undermine
district
judge’s
roles
as
impartial
decision
makers,
and
the
warnings
themselves
run
the
risk
of
being
misleading.
the
first
warning
would
encourage
the
use
of
stay-and-abeyance
when
it
is
not
in
the
petitioner’s
best
interest
to
pursue
such
a
course,
and
the
second
would
force
upon
district
judges
to
potentially
burdensome
task
of
making
a
case
specific
calculation,
of
whether
the
aedpa
limitation
period
has
already
run
or
will
have
run
by
the
time
the
petitioner
returns
to
federal
court.
because
such
calculations
depend
upon
information
contained
in
documents
that
do
not
necessarily
accompany
the
petition,
a
district
judge’s
calculations
could
be
an
error
and
thereby
misinform
a
pro
se
litigant.
petitioner’s
reliance
on
castro
v.
united
states
is
misplaced.
castro
dealt
with
the
district
court’s
sua
sponte
recharacterization
of
a
prisoner’s
motion
and
did
not
address
the
question,
whether
a
district
court
is
required
to
explain
a
pro
se
litigant’s
options
before
a
voluntary
dismissal.
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
given
the
court
of
appeals'
concern
that
respondent
had
been
affirmatively
mislead
quite
apart
from
the
district
court’s
failure
to
give
the
two
warnings.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens

opinion

the
judgment,

justice

opinion,
in
