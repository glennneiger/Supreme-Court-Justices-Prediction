unknown
speaker
is
there
some
peculiar
virtue
about
the
word
advisements
as
opposed
to
advice?
unknown
speaker
before
we
get
to
that,
do
you
agree
that
some
kind
of
remedy
is
required
here,
warnings
or
no
warnings,
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
what
the
judge
did
tell
the...
the
defendant
in
this
case
seems
to
have
been
just
affirmatively
misleading.
he
said
you...
dismiss
and
then
you
can
come
back
when
it
was
perfectly
clear,
that...
that
he
could
never
come
back
that
the
time
in...
in
all
practical
terms
would
have
run.
haven't
we
got
to
do
something
or
hasn't
the
courts
got
to
do
something
to
correct
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
is...
is
there
any
chance--
--well,
is
that
issue
still
open?
i
mean,
even
if
you're
correct
on
your
premise
that
a
court
doesn't
have
to
inform
a
defendant
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
is...
is
the
issue
of
possible
misleading
of
the
defendant
open
on
the
remand
even
if
you
were
successful?
unknown
speaker
well,
shouldn't
it
be?
i
mean,
if...
if
we
think
that
the
record
shows
there
is
some
evidence
of
misleading
where
the
defendant
expressed
concern
about
a
statute
of
limitations
problem
and
was
told
it
wouldn't
present
a
problem,
when
in
fact
it
did...
it
had
already
run...
you
don't
think
that
should
be
open
on
remand?
unknown
speaker
but
it
wasn't
without
prejudice.
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
he
could
never
come
back
because
the
statute
of
limitations,
as
i
understand
the
facts,
had
already
run
before
the
case
was
even
dismissed
in
the
district
court.
so
he
could
never
come
back.
therefore,
without
prejudice
was
surely
misleading.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
any
person
in
the
prisoner's
position
would
conceivably
have
understood
the
statement
as
you
have
just
defined
the
term,
without
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
maybe
somebody
who...
who
had
three
law
degrees
could
figure
that
out,
but
a
defendant
standing
certainly
isn't
going
to
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
and
they
have
always
made
a
statement
that
was
affirmatively
misleading?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
we...
we
may
agree
with
you
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
give
warnings.
that's...
that's
a...
that's
an
open
question.
but
surely
the
court
is...
is
not
free
to
make
misleading
statements.
unknown
speaker
we
need
to...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
wouldn't
any
defendant
in
his
right
mind,
if
he
had
known
that
he
could
not
come
back
into
court,
that
the
statute
had
run,
at
least
have
said,
well,
judge,
get
rid
of
the
unexhausted
claims
so
that
i
can
at
least
litigate
the
ones
which
i
have
filed
in
time
and
which
are
exhausted?
wouldn't
that
have
been
the
only
sensible
thing
for
him
to
do
if...
if
he
had
understood
what
you
understand?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
about
the
unexhausted
claims
that
have
to
go
first
to
the
state
court?
when
rose
v.
lundy
was
decided,
this
problem
of
time
didn't
exist
because
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations
on
federal
habeas.
now
that
there
is
this
bind,
why
isn't
it
appropriate
to
say
the
stay
and
abeyance
applies
not
simply
to
the
federal
claim
but
to
the
entire
complaint,
which
is...
is
the
ordinary
rule
when
there's
a...
a
prior
action
pending
or
abstention?
usually
the...
the
whole
complaint
just
sits
in
federal
court
till
the
state
court
is
through.
why
shouldn't
this,
now
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
12
months,
in
the
picture,
be
the
same
way?
unknown
speaker
so
not
added
back.
i
mean,
this
is
the
third
circuit's
solution,
and
i'm
asking
you
why
isn't
that
the
simplest
way
to
deal
with
this.
nothing
is
added
back.
everything,
the
entire
complaint
sits
in
federal
court
while
the
petitioner
goes
over
to
state
court
to
exhaust
the
state
claims
and
then
comes
back
to
the
federal
court
with
nothing
to
supplement.
the
complaint
is
already
there.
unknown
speaker
but
coming...
with
the
ability
to
come
back,
which
was
not
a
problem
then
because
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
just
to
elaborate
on
justice
ginsburg's
question,
what
is
your
answer
to
her
point?
why...
imagine
the
imaginary
author
of
rose
v.
lundy.
when
i
read
this,
i
think
they're
worried
about
exhausting
the
state
claim
so
the
state
will
have
a
chance
to
pass
on
it.
all
right.
now,
what
justice
ginsburg
just
said
gives
the
state
the
chance
to
pass
on
it.
what
is
it
in
rose
v.
lundy
that
cares
whether
the
way
you
give
the
state
to
pass
on
it
is
to
dismiss
the
whole
thing
and
let
them
pass
on
it
or
hold
it
on
the
docket
and
let
them
pass
on
it
or
call
them
into
your
office,
any
other
thing
you
can
think
of?
i
mean,
what
is
it
in
rose
v.
lundy
that
cares
how
you
give
the
state
opportunity
to
pass
on
it
as
long
as
they
pass
on
it?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
rose
v.
lundy
could
have...
could
have
said
what
is
now
being
proposed
if
it
had
wanted
to.
i
mean,
rose
v.
lundy
could
have
said...
instead
of
you
have
to
dismiss
the
whole
thing,
they
could
have
simply
said,
you
know,
hold
it
abeyance.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
you
think--
--so,
of
course,
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations
in
place
when
rose
was
decided.
there
would
have
been
no
point
to
put
that
in
the
opinion
when
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations
in
place.
unknown
speaker
well,
presumably
congress
knew
about
rose
v.
lundy
when
it
enacted
aedpa
and
didn't
indicate
any
change
in
rose
v.
lundy.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
there
any
indications
when
they
passed
aedpa,
that
the
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
like
two-thirds
of
all
petitions
are
filed
incorrectly
in
the
federal
courts
because
they
don't
know
where
to
go?
i
mean,
these
are
not
legally
represented
people.
is...
i
mean,
i'd
be
interested
in
that.
is
there
information
there
that
suggests
congress
focused
on
that
and
said,
we
don't
want
to...
we...
we
just
want
to...
is
there
or
not?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
you're
asking
us
in
this
case
to
say
that
the
stay
and
abeyance
procedure
is...
is
not
a
valid
procedure.
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
it
didn't
occur
in
this
case.
here
mr.
ford
chose
dismissal
without
prejudice.
there
was
not
a
stay
and
abeyance
used
here.
why
should
we
rule
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
just
you're
asking
us
to
reach
beyond
the
confines
of
this
case
in
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
it
would.
we
have
a
question
here
of
whether
some
particular
advice
was
required,
yes
or
no,
and
i
don't
see
how
we
get
into
stay
and
abeyance
in
this
case
properly.
unknown
speaker
six
of
the
seven
circuits
allow
it
i
know,
but
i
don't
see
how
we...
we
get
into
it
here.
unknown
speaker
but
we
could
rule,
i
suppose,
that
the
advice
was
unnecessary
when
leaving
open
the
question
of
whether
the
stay
and
abey
proceeding
is
permissible
or
desirable,
whatever.
right.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
also
a
second
question
presented
about
the
relation
back.
i...
i
hope
you'll
take
an
opportunity
to
state
your
point
of
view
on
that.
unknown
speaker
but
the
ninth
circuit
did
that
only
because
their
own
precedents
said
all
you
can
stay
is
the
federal
claim.
you
can't
stay
the
entire
petition.
that's
was
the
preliminary
to
doing
this
fancy
15(c)
application.
unknown
speaker
if
the
ninth
circuit
decided
or
if
we
decided
that
equitable
tolling
is
permissible
in
this
case,
what...
what
procedure
should
be
adopted
to
reflect
that
rule?
i
know
that's
maybe
not...
not
your
position,
but
if
that...
if
that
were
the
holding,
how...
how
would
that
work?
and...
and
how
is
that
any
different
than
relation
back?
unknown
speaker
let...
let
me
ask
you
this
somewhat
related
question.
you
look
at
the
records
that
the...
that's
presented...
the
petitions
that
are
presented
to
the
district
courts
through
their
magistrates,
and
they're
bewildering.
the
petitioner
really
restates
a
claim
in
three
or
four
different
ways
to
make
sure
he's
left
nothing
out.
and
the...
the
district
courts
are...
are
very
busy.
suppose
you
have
a
sort
of
johnny-on-the-spot,
prompt
attorney
at...
at
the
habeas
level
in
a
federal
court
and
he
files
on
day
one.
he
has
got
a
year
but
he
files
on
day
one.
the
district
court
just
doesn't
get
around
to
it
until,
say,
the
10th
month,
and
then
it
says,
oh,
well,
this
has...
this
has
some
unexhausted
claim.
any
relief
for
the...
or
even
on
day
360.
any
relief
available
there
for
the
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
in
my
hypothetical
district
judge
number
one
rules
in
a
week.
district
judge
number
two
waits
300
days.
the
petitioner
is
in
the
same
position
in
either
case
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
that...
that
would...
that
may
well
be
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
but
you
could
also
have
a
stay
and
abey
rule
in
which
in
order
to...
to
grant
the
petitioner
time
to
go
back
and...
and
litigate
the
state
claims,
he
has
to
make
a...
a
showing
first
that
there
is
some
reason
to
excuse
his
delay,
in
other
words,
a...
a
kind
of
an
equitable
tolling
argument
at
the
threshold.
and...
and
if...
if
that
were
the
requirement,
then
the...
the
scenario
that
you
just...
just
outlined
would...
would
not
be
an
objection.
unknown
speaker
so
you're...
you're
saying
that...
that
there
cannot
be
equitable
tolling
under
aedpa?
unknown
speaker
leaving
aside
tolling,
you
said
something
i
didn't
quite
grasp;
that
is,
if
you
allowed
the
federal
petition
to
sit
while
you
went
to
state
court,
all
this
is
well
within
the
12-month
period.
you're
in
state
court,
you
exhaust
everything
there.
the
statute
is
tolled
during
that
time.
then
you
come
back
to
federal
court
and
you...
as
long
as
you're
still
within
the
12
months,
you're
okay.
it
doesn't
gut
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
just
recognizes
that
it's
tolled
while
you're
in
state
court.
unknown
speaker
are
you
now
questioning
the
propriety
of...
let's
just
stick
with
the
rose
v.
lundy
the
way
it
was.
you
have
the
federal
claim
and
the
state
claims.
you
lop
off
the
state
claims.
are
you
saying
the
federal
court
can't
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
let
this
federal
claim
sit
until
the
state
is
through?
why
should
i
adjudicate
it?
maybe
he'll
prevail
on
some
claim
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
that
it
would
or
wouldn't?
unknown
speaker
so
are
you
saying
that
the
federal
court
would
have
no
choice
under
the...
we'll
keep
the
federal
claim
in
federal
court,
no
choice
but
to
go
full
steam
ahead
on
that
claim?
unknown
speaker
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
some
federal
courts
did
that
and
after
exhaustion
was
over,
the
case
came
back
and...
with
now
the
state
claims
added
in?
unknown
speaker
the
third
circuit
follows
what
i...
i
suggested
to
you
might,
in
this
post-aedpa
world,
be
appropriate,
that
is,
to
say
we're
going
to
stay...
we're
going
to
let
the
whole
complaint
sit
here.
unknown
speaker
not...
we're
not
going
to
lop
off
the
state
claims.
we
just
won't
turn
to
it
till
the
state
gets
finished.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
roadarmel.
ms.
bassis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
reasonable
to...
at
least
one
view,
to
think
that
congress...
we
think
congress
legislates
in
the
light
of
existing
law
or
existing
rules
from
this
court,
that
that's
exactly
what
congress
intended?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
you
say
there's
no
need
for
a
warning,
then
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
mistaken
here
to
require
a
warning?
unknown
speaker
were
there...
were
there
any
potential
equitable
tolling
arguments
open
to
him
other
than
based
on
the
so-called
misleading
advice?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
was
it
absolutely
clear
at
the
time
that
he
could
not
come
back?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
he
had
no...
no
basis
to
argue
that
he
could
come
back?
unknown
speaker
what
should
be
the
rule
if
the
habeas
petitioner
files
in...
in
federal
habeas
on
claims
one,
two
and
three,
and
those
have
already
been
exhausted?
but
then
a
week
after
he
files
in
the
federal
court,
makes
a
timely
filing,
he
says,
my
heavens,
i
have
claim
number
four,
and
he
files
that
in
the
state
court.
does
that
stay
claims
one,
two,
and
three
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
so
the
court...
so
the
federal
court
always
has
to
file
a
stay
when
it
knows
that
claim
four
has
just
been
filed
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
but
the...
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
suggests
that
a
district
court
really
doesn't
have
discretion.
it's...
to
me
it
suggested
that
the
district
court
had
to
do
this.
unknown
speaker
so
if
district
judge
had
advised
the
petitioner
of
the
ninth
circuit
law,
the
district
judge
would
have
been
wrong.
unknown
speaker
if
the
district
court...
based
on
what
you
say,
if
the
district
court
had
advised
the
petitioner
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
law
was,
the
district
court
would
have
been
wrong,
because
you
say
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
this...
all
this
seems
to
me
a
good
argument
that
the...
that
the
district
courts
shouldn't
have
to
advise
clients
of
their
rights.
it's
the...
the
job
of
the
client
to
figure
that
out.
unknown
speaker
but
it's...
it
can
be
a
very
complicated
question
to
know
what
time
is
left
to
make
a
state
claim.
the
court
is
often
not
in
a...
a
good
position
to
even
know
that
information
as
required
by
the
ninth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
well,
the...
the
ninth
circuit
ruling
seems
very
broad.
are...
are
you
suggesting
that
some
lesser
notification
would
be
adequate?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
so--
--that's
the
problem--
--if...
if
that's
so,
ms.
bassis,
why
do
you
not
agree
that
the
third
circuit's
approach
in
crews
v.
horn
is
the
right
one?
it's
the
simplest,
just
to
say
you
don't
have
to
tell
the...
the
petitioner,
you
don't
have
to
read
any
particular
litany.
you
just
say
we'll
put
the
federal
complaint
on
ice
while
he
goes
off
to...
to
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
before...
before
we...
we
launch
into
the...
into
the
stay
alternative,
i...
i'd
like
to
finish
up
the...
the
advisement
alternative.
this
is
not
the
only
situation
in
which
pro
se
litigants
would
profit
from
some
good
advice
from
the
court.
we
generally
do
not
require
the
courts
to...
to
act
as
counsel
for
the
litigants,
if
only
for
the
reason
that
they
may
give
wrong
advice,
in
which
case
you
will...
you...
you
will
have
an
equitable...
an
equitable
claim.
what...
what
is
distinctive
about...
about
this
area
that...
that
we
should
depart
from
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
significant
rights
that...
that
pro
se
litigants
bring
before
courts,
and...
and
i'm...
i'm
just
resistant
to
the
idea
that,
in
addition
to
the
requirements
that
the
constitution
imposes
to
give
counsel
to...
to
litigants,
we're...
we're
going
to
add
on
that
a...
a
requirement
in
some
situations
that
the
court
act
as
counsel
for
the
litigants.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
that?
i...
i
think
we...
we
do
it
where
it's
necessary
to
assure,
for
example,
the...
the
constitutional
validity
of
a
confession.
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
that's
not
a
matter
of,
you
know,
legal
advice
as
to
how
you
should
proceed
with
your
litigation.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was...
that
was
when
the
court
was
doing
something
on
its
own.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it--
--those
are
two
different
things.
i
think
it's
really
a...
a
major
departure
from...
from
the...
the
position
that
the
court
in...
in
common
law
jurisprudence
has
occupied.
it
would
be
the
first
time
that
i
know
of
where,
not
on...
not
because
of
something
the
court
itself
is
doing,
the
court
has
to
provide
legal
advice
to
a...
to...
to
an
indigent
prisoner.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
what
the
court
intended
in
rose
v.
lundy,
other
than
reading
the
opinion?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
an...
was
an
interpretation
of
aedpa.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it...
it
certainly
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
defendant.
but,
you
know,
congress
wasn't
trying
to
make
things
easy
for
defendants
in
aedpa.
unknown
speaker
but
there
wasn't
a
second
petition
there
to
which
it
could
relate
back.
i
don't
see
how
we
could
possibly
sustain
that--
unknown
speaker
--order
of
the
ninth
circuit.
that
just
came
out
of
no
place.
there
wasn't
anything
to
which
it
could
relate
back.
unknown
speaker
but
there
wasn't
a
stay
order.
i
mean,
that...
that's
just
manufacturing
something.
in
this
case
the
petitions
were
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would...
i
mean,
have
we
sanctioned
the
use
of,
quote,
nunc
pro
tunc,
closed
quote,
in
similar
situations
to
this?
unknown
speaker
i
said
have
we.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
case,
your
client
would
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
tried
to
put
your
client
in
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
simply
said
a...
a
mistake
was
made,
either
because
there
was
misleading
advice
or
because
there
was
a
failure
to
give
the
advice
that
we
say
should
have
been
given,
and
we're
simply
going
to
put
him
back
in
the
position
that
he
would
have
been
in
had
there
not
been
that
mistake,
i.e.,
put
him
back
with
a
petition
before
the
district
court
just
as
there
was
within
the...
the
1-year
period.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
the
relation
back
is
simply...
well,
it's...
i
guess
it's
one
way
of
explaining
something
that
the
court,
on
your
view
simply
under
its
power
to
correct
an
error,
could
have
done.
unknown
speaker
on
your
view,
ms.
bassis,
would
there
be
any
disincentive
for
a
litigant
to
bring
a
mixed
petition,
to
come
to
the
federal
court
first
rather
than
to
go
to
the
state
courts,
which
is
certainly
what...
what
aedpa
contemplates?
what...
what
disincentive
is
there?
unknown
speaker
what
does
he...
what
does
he
have
to
lose
by
just
marching
off
to
federal
court
with
all
his
claims?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
they're
in
their
interest,
but
they're
not
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
and
they
say,
you
know,
i
don't
know
which
ones
need
exhaustion
and
which
ones
don't.
i'm
just
going
to
dump
the
whole
thing
onto
federal
court.
won't
that
happen
in
every
situation?
and
is
that...
is
that
what
aedpa
contemplated?
unknown
speaker
would...
would
you
have
a
reason
to
object
to
a...
a
modification
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
talking
about?
and
instead
simply
of
this
kind
of
automatic
stay
and...
and
abeyance
procedure,
there
were
engrafted
on
it
a
further
condition,
and
the
condition
be
that
before
the...
the
stay
be
granted
and...
and
the
petition
kept
in
abeyance,
the...
the
defendant
would
have
to
show
that
there
was
some
good
reason
for
or
excuse
for
his
failure
to
exhaust
the...
the
unexhausted
claims.
that
would
accommodate...
the
reason
i
raise
it
is
that
would
accommodate
the...
the
issue,
at
least
in
part,
that
justice
scalia
is
raising
and
it
would
address
the
case
that
your
answer
didn't
address,
and
that
is,
of...
of
the
prisoner
under
a
death
sentence
who
does
not
want
fast
action
at
all.
he
wants
the
slowest
action
possible.
would
there
be
an
objection
to...
to
engrafting
that
further
condition
of
a
defendant
must
excuse
failure
to
the
ninth
circuit's
procedure?
unknown
speaker
justice
souter
is
suggesting
that
it
must
take
into
account
that
factor.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
would
be
a
good
excuse?
that
i...
i
didn't
know
enough?
unknown
speaker
would
it...
would
it
be
an
excuse
that
i'm
not
a
lawyer
and
i
didn't
realize
i
had
to
exhaust?
unknown
speaker
he's
bringing
the
claim
in
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
how
could
he
not
know
the
claim?
he's
bringing
it
in
federal
court,
and...
and
the
objection
is
you
should
have
brought
it
in
state
court
first.
what
possible
excuse
could
he
have?
i
mean,
the
normal
excuse
is
going
to
be,
you
know,
i'm
just...
i'm
just
a
simple
prisoner.
i'm
not
a
lawyer.
i...
i
had
no
idea
i
had
to
exhaust.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
certainly
see
that
condition
in...
in
the
procedure
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted,
that
it...
there
has
to
be
some
justification
for
not
having
exhausted.
is...
is
that
set
forth
in...
in
the
ninth
circuit's
procedure?
unknown
speaker
that's
new
to
me.
unknown
speaker
but
you...
and
you
disagree
then
with
the
ninth
circuit
which
said,
in
effect,
that
it
is...
the
district
courts
don't
have
discretion.
they
must
grant
a
stay.
unknown
speaker
but
perhaps
you
and
i
don't
read
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
the
same
way
insofar
as
the...
the
authority
of
a
district
court
to...
in
its
discretion
to
turn
down
a
stay
application.
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
there
was
no
discretion.
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
us
any
idea,
perhaps
anecdotally,
about
the
number
of...
of
times
we
have
mixed
petition
arguments
or
questions
about
mixed
petitions?
is
it
10
percent
of
the
time,
do
you
think,
or
90
percent
of
the
time?
i
see
them
all
the
time.
the
reason
i
ask
is
you
say
the
district
judge
has
discretion
to
stay
and
abey
in
every
case.
this
is
a...
a
huge
undertaking
by
the
judicial
system
to
make
aedpa
work,
and
aedpa
was
supposed
to
simplify
things.
unknown
speaker
do...
do
you
have
any
idea
of
the...
the
number
of
instances
in
which
there's
an
allegation
of
a
mixed
petition?
unknown
speaker
about
57?
unknown
speaker
and
is
this
in
the
central
district
or
the
california
or
all
over?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
was
something
like...
i
got
it
from
some
official
source...
said
there
were
about
two-thirds
were
actually
filed
in
the
wrong
court,
namely
the
federal
court.
and
i
think
it
was
57
percent
of
those
that
were
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
that's
where
it
came
from.
that's
what--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
ms.
bassis.
mr.
roadarmel,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
