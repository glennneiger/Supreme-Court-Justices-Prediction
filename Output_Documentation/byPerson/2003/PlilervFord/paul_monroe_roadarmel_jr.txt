mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1996
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
or
aedpa,
was
enacted,
which
imposed
a
1-year
limitation
period
upon
the
filing
of
federal
habeas
petitions
following
the
finality
of
a
state
criminal
conviction.
in
duncan
v.
walker,
this
court
held
that
the
1-year
limitation
period
may
be
tolled
during
the
pendency
of
a
properly
filed
state
post-conviction
or
other
collateral
application,
but
not
during
the
pendency
of
a
federal
habeas
application.
despite
that
holding,
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
concluded
that
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
admittedly
mixed
federal
habeas
petitions
was
improper
and
prejudicial
because
the
district
court
did
not
provide
certain
advisements
designed
to
effectuate
the
ninth
circuit's
practice
of
stay
and
abeyance.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
no,
not
in
this
particular
situation,
your
honor.
we
believe
stay
and
abeyance
is
incompatible
with
this
court's
precedent,
as
well
as
aedpa,
for
four
reasons.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
we
don't
believe
that
the
advice
was
misleading
or
erroneous
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
no,
we
don't
believe
it
would
be.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
if
that
were
the
case,
perhaps
that
would
be
the
situation
or
perhaps
that
would
be
the
remedy.
that
wasn't
the
case
here.
the
district
court
told
ford
that
he
could
refile
his
petitions
following
exhaustion
and
dismissed
the
mixed
petitions
without
prejudice.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
no.
dismissal
without
prejudice
merely
means
that
the
petitioner
can
refile.
it
will
be
a
separate
issue
as
to
whether
the
claims
of
the
petition
that
he
refiles
will
be
considered
on
its
merits.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
yes.
i--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--well,
that...
that
has
always
been
the
procedure
when
courts
have
addressed
mixed
petitions.
they
have
always
dismissed
them
without
prejudice.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
there
is
no
statement
here,
we
believe,
that
was
affirmatively
misleading.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
well,
the
court--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--not
necessarily.
a
federal
habeas
petitioner
may
believe,
in
fact,
that
his
exhausted
claims
are
unmeritorious
or
frivolous
compared
with
the
claims
that
he
wishes
to
exhaust
in
state
court.
so
there
may
be
circumstances
where
a
federal
habeas
petitioner
will
not,
in
fact,
object
to
the
dismissal
of
even
his
exhausted
claims
or
to
the...
the
dismissal
of
an
entire
petition.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
i
think
there
are
two
responses
to
that.
the
first
is
that
congress
would
not
have
contemplated
that
procedure
because
congress,
in
incorporating
section
2254(b)(1)
in
virtually
unaltered
form,
would
have
contemplated
rose
v.
lundy's
application
in
the
way
it
had
always
been
applied
by
this
court.
the
second
response
is
that
a
stay
of
the
proceeding
under
those
circumstances
would
make
sense
only
if
the
claims
that
are
being
dismissed
as
unexhausted
can
be
added
back
and
would,
in
fact,
be--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--that
procedure
guts
rose
v.
lundy
and
aedpa.
rose
v.
lundy
would
have
absolutely
no
meaning
under
that
procedure
because
rose
v.
lundy
never
contemplated
that
procedure.
it
contemplated
the
complete
dismissal
of
a
mixed
petition
or,
at
most,
the
dismissal
of
unexhausted
claims
from
a
mixed
petition.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
well,
even
prior
to
the
enactment
of
aedpa,
refiled
petitions
would
not
necessarily
be
considered
on
their
merits.
claims
could
be
procedurally
defaulted,
for
instance,
and
if
the
default
was
based
upon
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground,
the
claims
would
not
be
considered
on
their
merits,
but
would
be
summarily
denied.
so
even
prior
to
the
enactment
of
aedpa,
this
court
contemplated
that
refiled
petitions
would
not
necessarily
be
considered
on
their
merits.
but--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--because
rose
v.
lundy
contemplates
the
unexhausted
claims
will
be
presented
in
state
court
first,
and
it
enforces
or
promotes
that
through
what
this
court
has
referred
to
in
rose
v.
lundy
as
a
rigorously
enforced
total
exhaustion
requirement.
now,
if
the
petitioner
can
simply
file
a
mixed
petition
in
federal
court
without
any
consequences
either
under
rose
v.
lundy
or
under
aedpa,
what
we
will
have
is
a
situation
where
petitioners
have
an
incentive
to
file
mixed
petitions
in
federal
court
instead
of
presenting
their
unexhausted
claims
in
state
court
first.
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
in
duncan
v.
walker
that
aedpa
is
not
indifferent
between
state
and
federal
filings,
but
promotes
and
encourages
the
filing
of
unexhausted
claims
in
state
court
first--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--yes.
and
in
fact,
this
court
has
always
disapproved
of
stays
of...
of
mixed
petitions.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--no.
and
congress
certainly,
if
it
had
desired
a
stay
or
contemplated
a
stay
of
proceedings
pending
exhaustion,
could
have
put
something
into
aedpa
that--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--there's
nothing
in
the
congressional
record
to
indicate
that
as
to
what
individual
members
of
congress
had
before
them
in
terms
of
studies
or
other
data
at
the
time
aedpa
was
crafted.
i'm
not
aware.
but
the
congressional
record
doesn't
speak
to
that.
but
certainly
congress--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
because
it's--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--because
the
correctness
of
the
ninth
circuit's
advisement
requirements
can't
be
adequately
addressed
or
intelligently
addressed
without
understanding
what
it
is
they
promote
and
without
understanding
what
the
practice
is
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
well,
because--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--because
the
ninth
circuit
majority
concluded
that
the
failure
to
advise
in
the
manner
in
which
they
thought
was
appropriate
was
improper
and
prejudicial
because
they
assumed
that
had
the
advisement
been
given
with
regard
to
the
dismissal
of
unexhausted
claims
as
a
precondition
to
the
consideration
of
a
motion
to
stay,
that
ford
would
have
dismissed
his
unexhausted
claims.
and
in
doing
so,
the
district
court
would
have
been
required
to
grant
the
motion
to
stay.
in
fact,
the
majority
concludes
it
would
have
been
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
do
so.
so
it's
inextricably
bound
in
the
advisement
requirement
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
yes.
the
ninth
circuit,
after
concluding
that
the
advisements
that
were
given
in
this
case
were
inadequate
and
misleading,
fashioned
a
remedy
for
that
particular
error
which
it
believed
occurred
by
way
of
applying
rule
15(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
in
a
manner
that
no
other
circuit
court
has
ever
applied
before.
in
fact,
three
prior
panels
of
the
ninth
circuit
itself
concluded
that
relation
back
would
not
apply
under
these
circumstances
because
there's
nothing
to
which
the
subsequent
proceeding
can
relate
back.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
yes,
but
in
doing
so,
what
the
ninth
circuit
majority
did
was
have
a
subsequent
proceeding
relate
back
to
a
prior
proceeding
that
had
been
dismissed
and
was
no
longer
pending.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
well,
it's...
it's
difficult
to
say
because
equitable
tolling
has
been
applied
differently
in
different
situations.
the
ninth
circuit
itself
applies
it
in
a
very
different
fashion
than
it
was
applied
in
this
case.
i
suppose
equitable
tolling
could
be
applied
to
toll
the
limitation
period
during
the
pendency
of
the
first
set
of
proceedings,
the
1997
proceedings,
up
to
the
time
that
the
claims
were...
or
the
petitions
were
dismissed
as
unexhausted.
that
would
leave
ford
with
5
days
to
file
his
unexhausted
claims
in
state
court,
exhaust,
and...
and
then
return
with
those
claims
to
federal
court.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
it
certainly
wouldn't
appear
to
be
the
case
under
aedpa
because
aedpa
doesn't
toll
the
limitation
period
during
pendency
of
the
federal
habeas
proceeding,
and
that's
very
clear,
we
believe,
from
the
statute
itself.
so
an
individual
filing
a
petition
in
federal
court
is
well
advised,
of
course,
to
ensure
that
all
the
claims
are
fully
exhausted.
the
eighth
circuit
in
akins
v.
kenney
suggested
that
where
a
petitioner
is
concerned
that
any
of
his
claims
may
be
unexhausted,
he's
well
advised
under
aedpa
to
present
those
claims
in
state
court
first
and
accomplish
two
goals
simultaneously.
first,
he
exhausts
beyond
any
doubt,
and
second,
he
tolls
the
limitation
period
during
the
pendency
of
that
proceeding.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
yes,
because
i
think
the
petitioner
has
to
contemplate
the
vagaries
of
any
kind
of
judicial
interpretation
or
ruling
on
his
matters,
and
that
may
depend
upon
the
particular
court.
it
may
depend
upon
the
caseload.
it
may
depend
upon
the
particular
matter
that's
put
before
the
court,
the
number
of
claims,
the
complexity,
and
so
on.
that's
always
going
to
vary
in
any
case.
a
petitioner
who
files
a
one-claim
petition
will
most
assuredly
receive
a
quicker
resolution
of
that
than
the
petitioner
who
files
a
200-page
petition
containing
hundreds
of
claims.
that's
just
in
the
nature
of
any
kind
of
adjudication
in
any
kind
of
court.
and
that
has
to
be
contemplated
and
anticipated
by
any
would-be
federal
habeas
petitioner
because
if
that
petitioner
files
a
mixed
petition
under
aedpa,
the
clock
keeps
ticking
during
the
pendency
of
that
federal
habeas
proceeding
no
matter
how
long
or
how
short.
so,
again,
he's
well
advised,
as
the
eighth
circuit
noted,
to
file
any
claims
that
he's
unsure
about
in
state
court
first.
and
that's
what
aedpa
contemplates,
as
this
court
concluded
in
duncan
v.
walker.
to
allow
petitioners
to
file
mixed
petitions
in
federal
court
without
any
consequences
and...
and
to
do
so
in
the
manner
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
contemplates
it
here
and
in
other
cases
would
eviscerate
aedpa's
limitation
period
because,
as
we
point
out
in
our
briefing,
a
petitioner
could
well
file
a
mixed
petition
containing
only
one
exhausted
claim,
confident
that
all
of
his
unexhausted
claims
will
be
purged
from
the
petition,
the
remaining
exhausted
claims
stayed,
and
those
purged
claims,
following
exhaustion,
will
be
added
back
to
the
state
petition,
no
matter
that
they
were
pursued
in
state
court
after
the
expiration
of
the
limitation
period,
and
they
will
be
deemed
timely
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
problem
with
that
approach,
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
application
of
equitable
tolling
to
aedpa,
is
that
aedpa
itself
doesn't
contemplate
the
application
of
such
tolling.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
it
certainly
seems
foreclosed
by
this
court's
holdings
in
united
states
v.
beggerly,
united
states
v.
brockamp,
and
lampf
v.
gilbertson.
in
all
of
those
cases,
this
court
concluded,
in
reviewing
federal
limitation
periods,
that
because
the
statutes
contain
tolling
provisions
within
them,
it
would
be
inconsistent,
incompatible
with
those
statutes
to
apply
equitable
tolling.
congress
had
spoken
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
tolling
could
be
applied.
in
beggerly,
in
particular,
this
court
concluded
that
under
the
federal
quiet
title
act,
equitable
tolling
would
be
inapplicable
because
there
was
already
an
accrual
or
tolling
provision
built
in
that
provided
that
the
limitation
period
did
not
begin
to
run
until
the
plaintiff
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
of
the
claim
of
the
united
states.
aedpa
contains
a
very
similar
provision
in
section
2244(d)(1),
subsection
(d),
which
provides
that
the
limitation
period
does
not
begin
to
run
until
the
petitioner
was
aware
of
the
factual
predicate
of
the
claim
or
claims
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
in
brockamp,
this
court
commented
upon
the
tolling
provisions
in
the
irs
tax
refund
statute
and
noted
that
because
they
were
numerous
and
very
specific,
equitable
tolling
likewise
would
be
incompatible
with
the
statute.
aedpa
also
contains
very
specific
tolling
provisions,
beyond
the
one
that
i
just
described,
tolling
where
there
is
a
properly
filed
state
post-conviction
or
other
collateral
application,
tolling
where,
for
instance,
unconstitutional
state
action
leads
to
an
impediment
to
filing,
tolling
where
this
court
issues
a
ruling
on
an
issue
of
federal
constitutional
law
that's
made
retroactively
applicable
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
hypothetical,
your
honor.
if
claims
are
presented
in
state
court,
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
limitation
period,
yes,
they
will
toll
the
limitation
period.
the
problem
with
stay
and
abeyance
under
that
situation,
however,
is
that
it
actually
gives
the
petitioner
greater
benefits
under
aedpa
than
he
received
prior
to
the
enactment
of
aedpa.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
aedpa,
mixed
petitions
in...
in
certain
circuits
would
actually,
instead
of
being
dismissed,
have
their
unexhausted
claims
purged,
and
the
petitioner
would
go
back
to
state
court
and
exhaust
those
claims.
but
the
purged
petition,
the
purged
federal
habeas
petition,
would
go
forward
and
be
resolved
expeditiously.
it
would
not
be
stayed.
and
that
i
think
was
the
basis
of
the
plurality's
warning
in
rose
v.
lundy
that
where
a
petitioner
chooses
that
course
of
action,
he
will
be
barred
from
having
his
refiled
claims
considered
on
the
merits
because
they
will
consist
of
a
second
or
successive
application.
they
will
consist
of
a
second
or
successive
application
only
if
the
purged
federal
habeas
petition
goes
forward.
if
it's
stayed,
there
will
never
be
a
second
or
successive
application
relating
to
those
claims.
and
that
would,
i
think,
vitiate
not
only
rule
9(b)
of
the
rules
governing--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--well,
this
court
has
never
intimated
that
that
would
be
appropriate
procedure.
in
fact,
under
rose
v.
lundy,
in--
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
--it
would
not.
in...
in
mccleskey
v.
zant,
when
this
court
talked
about
second
or
successive
applications
and
abuse
of
the
writ,
it
contemplated
or
presumed
that
that
procedure
followed
under
rose
v.
lundy
would
lead
to
those
refiled
claims
constituting
second
or
successive
applications.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
i
think
so
because
to
do
otherwise
would
be
inconsistent
with
rose
v.
lundy,
rule
9(b),
but
it
would
also
be
inconsistent
with
aedpa
because
aedpa
contains
a
provision
in
section
2244(b)(1)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
that
requires
claims
that
are
dismissed
from
an
initial
petition
and
submitted
as
a
second
or
successive
application
to
be
dismissed.
if
we're
always
going
to
stay
mixed
petitions,
pending
the
exhaustion
of
even
timely
presented
unexhausted
claims,
it
certainly
leads
one
to
wonder
what
the
purpose
of
section
2244(b)(1)
would
be.
that
also
appears
to
contemplate
what
the
plurality
suggested
in
rose
v.
lundy,
which
is
that
the
purged
federal
habeas
petition
goes
full
speed
ahead,
to
use
your
words,
and
that
it's
not,
in
fact,
stayed.
to
stay
the
federal
habeas
petition
under
those
circumstances
would
also
result
in
delay,
which
is
something
that
is
inimical
to
aedpa.
as
a
number
of
lower
courts
have
pointed
out,
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
aedpa
is
to
tighten
the
federal
habeas
process.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
no,
you're
not
wrong
in
thinking
that.
in
fact,
the
third
circuit
in
crews
v.
horn
follows
that
particular
procedure.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
monroe
roadarmel,
jr.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
make
four
brief
points.
the
proof
is
in
the
pudding
regarding
stay
and
abeyance
and
what
we're
experiencing
in
california.
we're
experiencing
greater
delays
since
the
enactment
of
aedpa
than
we
ever
experienced
before
because
of
stay
and
abeyance
and
relation
back,
particularly
in
capital
federal
habeas
cases.
we
make
mention
in
footnote
1
of
our
reply
brief
of
a
capital
federal
habeas
case
pending
in
the
central
district
court
of
california
called
reno
v.
woodford.
in
that
case,
the
district
court
issued
a
stay
of
the
purged
petition
on
may
7th,
1999
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
allowing
the
petitioner
to
exhaust
his
state
court
remedies.
to
date,
no
state
court
exhaustion
petition
has
been
filed.
none
is
on
the
horizon.
but
under
stay
and
abeyance
and
relation
back,
whenever
one
is
filed
and
the
claims
are
exhausted
and
added
back
into
the
state
petition,
those
claims
will
be
deemed
timely
by
the
district
court,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
at
this
point
in
time,
at
best,
they
will
be
presented
for
exhaustion
in
state
court
more
than
5
years
after
the
expiration
of
aedpa's
limitation
period.
the
second
point
is
that
ford
in
this
case
knew
that
the
1997
petitions
he
filed
contained
unexhausted
claims.
he
admitted
as
much
to
the
district
court
in
connection
with
our
motion
to
dismiss
those
petitions.
that's
found
at
pages
56
to
57
and
75
of
78
of
the
joint
appendix.
ford
purposely
filed
mixed
petitions.
he
knew
of
the
limitation
period
as
well
because
he
indicated
in
filings
to
the
district
court
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
his
1997
petitions
in
in
time
so
that
he
would
have
them
before
the
court
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
limitation
period.
what
stay
and
abeyance
does
is
reward
petitioners
like
ford
who
file
admittedly
mixed
petitions
knowing
full
well
the
identity
of
the
unexhausted
claims
that
they're
asserting.
if
they're
aware
of
those
unexhausted
claims,
there's
no
reason
why
those
petitioners
should
not
have
and
could
not
have
presented
those
claims
in
state
court
first,
and
they
would
have
received
a
proper
benefit
under
aedpa
by
doing
so.
they
would
have
exhausted
the
claims
so
the
federal
court
could
consider
them
on
the
merits
conceivably
if
there
wasn't
some
kind
of
default
that
was
applicable,
and
they
would
also
toll
the
limitation
period
during
the
pendency
of
that
state
proceeding.
ford
was
under
the
misapprehension
that
his
federal
filing
tolled
the
limitation
period
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
petitioner
in
duncan
was
under
the
misapprehension
that
his
first
mixed
petition
tolled
the
limitation
period
in
that
case
as
well.
we
know
from
duncan
v.
walker
that
it
does
not.
finally,
advice
regarding
aedpa's
limitation
period,
to
be
meaningful
at
all,
to
be
more
than
just
a
meaningless
gesture,
has
to
rely
on
specific
documents
and
has
to
provide
specific
information
that
a
district
court
is
simply
in
no
position
to
provide
at
the
time
a
mixed
petition
is
dismissed.
the
only
documents
a
district
court
typically
has
before
it
at
that
time
are
documents
relating
to
filings
by
the
petitioner
in
the
state
supreme
court.
the
allegations
contained
in
those
documents
are
then
compared
against
the
allegations
in
the
federal
habeas
proceeding
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
claims
are
exhausted.
the
court
does
not
have
before
it
the
entire
record
of
proceedings.
and
even
if
it
did,
there
are
certain
circumstances
that
would
warrant
tolling
that
would
not
be
contained
in
those
documents
and
the
court
would
not
be
able
to
make
any
kind
of
a
reasoned
decision
or
give
any
kind
of
reason
or
correct
advice
regarding
the
impact
of
the
limitation
period
on
any
unexhausted
claims.
stay
and
abeyance
we
believe
vitiates
aedpa
by
rendering
largely
irrelevant
the
limitation
period,
rendering
the
state
court
tolling
provision
near
surplusage,
and
in
effect,
encouraging
petitioners
to
file
mixed
petitions
in
federal
court
instead
of
presenting
their
unexhausted
claims
in
state
court
first.
thank
you.
