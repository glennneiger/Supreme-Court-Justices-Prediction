ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
yes,
you
are,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
this
court
adopted
the
total
exhaustion
rule
in
rose,
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations
for
the
filing
of
federal
habeas
petitions,
and
a
prisoner
seeking
to
file
a
second
federal
petition,
after
fully
exhausting
state
remedies,
faced
no
time
bar.
but
aedpa
added
to
the
mix
a
1-year
statute
of
limitations,
which
in
many
cases,
such
as
mr.
ford's,
converts
the
choices
under
rose
into
a
complete
bar
on
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
no,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
what
rose
said
is
that
a
prisoner
be
afforded
a
choice,
and
that
choice
involves
either
proceeding
on
exhausted
claims
and
deleting
the
unexhausted
or
dismissing
the
petition
without
prejudice
to
a
right
to
return.
no
one
ever
suggested
in
rose
that
the
petitioner
would
lose
the
right
to
have
even
his
exhausted
claims
heard
on
the
merits.
in
order
to
avoid
the
exhaustion
requirement
from
becoming
what
would,
in
effect,
be
a
trap
for
the
unwary
pro
se
prisoner
requires
nothing
more
than
adding
a
sentence
to
what
rose
already
requires,
a
sentence
made
critical
by
aedpa,
which
was
nonexistent
at
the
time
of
rose.
there
is
no
need
for
warning,
however,
if
the
court
issues
a
stay.
the
lower
courts
almost
unanimously
do
so
and
endorse
state
procedures
where
the
failure
to
do
so
would
result
in
a
forfeiture
of
the
right
to
federal
habeas
review.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
no,
i
don't,
not
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
ninth
circuit's
stay
procedure
is
somewhat
unusual.
it
makes
it
incumbent
upon
the
prisoner
litigant
to
withdraw
his
unexhausted
claims
and
then
renew
a
motion
to
stay.
so
the
motion
to
stay
is
at
the
defendant's
or
the
petitioner's
election.
but
without
being
apprised
of
that
peculiar
procedure,
mr.
ford
was
not
informed
as
to
his
choice
of
options
with
regard
to
amendment.
the
only
choices
he
was
given
were
the
two
choices
under
rose:
delete
the
unexhausted
claims
and
proceed
on
the
exhausted
or
dismissal
of
the
entire
petition
without
prejudice,
an
option
which
was
illusory
at
the
time
it
was
given
to
him
because
of
the
running
of
the
limitations
period.
57
percent
of
the
habeas
petitions
filed
are
dismissed
for
want
of
exhaustion.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
well,
i
believe
that
there
were.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
well--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--well,
the
issue
is
that
he
had
a
potential
argument,
but
i
don't
know
what
mr.
ford
knew
at
that
time
in
terms
of
the
availability
of
equitable
tolling.
he
certainly
didn't
know
about
the
availability
of
filing
a
contemporaneous
writ
petition
in
state
court
in
order
to
toll
the
limitations
period.
had
he
done
so,
most
assuredly
he
would
not
have
pursued
the
option
of
motions
to
stay,
which
he
filed
contemporaneously
with
his
writ.
i
doubt
that
he
also
knew
about
equitable
tolling,
statutory
tolling,
or
really
the
statute
of
limitations
and
how
that
was
calculated.
all
he
knew
is
that
there
was
1
year,
and
he
filed
in
time.
but
he
also
did
so
by
simultaneously
filing
a
motion
to
stay.
however,
without...
or
without
knowledge
at
the
time
that
court
made
a
judicial
disposition
of
mr.
ford's
petitions,
that
he
could
elect
a
stay
procedure,
the
court...
he...
he
merely
went
with
the
option
of
dismissal
without
prejudice.
that
decision
was
not
informed
absent
further
information
about
the
availability
of
the
stay.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
well,
if
it's
filed
untimely,
i
don't
know
how
it
would
absent
a
stay
unless
the
court
granted
a
stay--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--no.
i
believe
that
a
court,
when
it
determines
that
a
petition
is
unexhausted,
may
on
its
own...
has
the
discretionary
authority,
taking
many
factors
into
consideration,
to
grant
a
stay
on
its
own
and
delete
the
unexhausted
claims.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
under
ninth
circuit
precedent,
the...
the
ninth
circuit
believed
that
a
district
court
lacks
discretion
to
stay
a
mixed
petition.
i
actually
believe
that
courts
have
broader
authority
than
what
the
ninth
circuit
held.
the
discretionary
authority
to
stay
is
part
of
the
inherent
power
of
the
courts,
and
courts
routinely
stay
matters
pending
before
them
while
there...
a
determination
of
independent
matters
relating
to
the
case
are
being
made.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
i'm
sorry.
pardon?
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
i'm
not...
i'm
saying
that
the
ninth
circuit
followed
its
own
precedent,
but
i'm
saying
that
the
power
to
stay
is
broader
than
what
the
ninth
circuit
precedent
currently
allows.
i
do
believe
the
courts--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--i
believe
that
that's
impossible
without
further
information
regarding
the
choices
under
rose.
the
reason
the
court
ruled
as
it
did
is
because
pro
se...
93
percent
of
the
habeas
petitioners
are
proceeding
in
pro
se.
mindful
of
the
fact
that
pro
se
litigants
require
certain
procedural
protections,
the
court
stepped
in
and
said
that
ceratin
advisements
are
required
in...
in
order
to...
to
assure
that
there
is
no
unwarranted
forfeiture
of
the
right
to
federal--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--justice
o'connor,
i
agree
with
you,
but
i'm
not
advocating
that
the
court
calculate
the
limitations
period.
what
i'm
requesting
is
not--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--i'm...
i'm
requesting
a
specific
notification,
not
an
advisement,
but
a
warning,
and
i
believe
that
there
is
a
distinction.
but
what
i'd
propose
that
the
circuit
courts
be
required
to
give,
where
a
mixed
petition
is
filed,
is
after
the
rose
options
are
afforded
to
the
prisoner,
they
also
be
told
prisoners
have
a
1-year
period,
generally
starting
when
their
conviction
becomes
final
and
excluding
the
time
when
a
state
post-conviction
application
is
pending,
in
which
to
file
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition,
absent
cause
for
equitable
tolling.
before
deciding
to
dismiss
your
petition
to
exhaust
claims,
you
should
determine
whether
your
1-year
period
has
expired
and,
if
not,
how
much
time
remains.
it
requires
no
additional
burden
for
the
district
court
to
give
this
kind
of
admonition
or
this
kind
of
warning.
the
court
is
not
required
to
calculate
the
limitations
period,
and
i
agree
with
your
honor.
at
the
time
that
this
decision
is
made,
the
court
probably
doesn't
have
a
sufficient
record
to
make...
to
undergo
the
complex
task
of
computing
the
limitations
period
and
making
that
decision.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
well,
i
agree
with
your
honor
completely.
and
in
fact,
i
don't
believe
that
warnings
are
necessary
if
stays
are
permitted.
in
fact,
it
would
make
the
stays
essentially
superfluous,
but
a
stay
is...
a
warning
is
necessary
if
there
is
no
stay.
now,
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
slayton
was
cited
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
lacks
authority
to
stay
a
mixed
petition.
slayton
is
distinguishable
in
that,
first
of
all,
it
didn't
involve
a
mixed
petition.
it
involved
a
singular
claim.
and
the
state
in
that
case
argued
that
the
claim,
the
senility
of
the
trial
court
judge,
was
a
matter,
a
sensitive
matter,
exclusively
of
state
court
concern.
so
for
that
reason,
this
court
held
that
a
stay
was
inappropriate.
yet,
at
the
same
time,
it
acknowledged--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--because
of
the
right
of
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
this
is
a
very,
very
significant
right,
one
of
the
last
equitable
bastions
that
remain
available
to
a
litigant
to
challenge
their
state
court
conviction.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
i
understand.
however,
this
court
already
requires
advisements
in
certain
limited
instances
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
pro
se
litigants'
rights
require
careful
protection.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
that's
true,
but
this
court--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--that's
true,
and
that
constitutes
an
advisement
as
distinguished
from
a
warning.
however,
in
united
states
v.
castro,
this
court
did
require
certain
limited
advisements
when
recharacterizing
a
motion
for
relief.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
true,
and
this
is...
this...
the
advisement
or
the
warning
that
i'm
requesting
is
done
in
order
to
effectuate
the
choices
under
rose.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
well,
in
light
of
rose
v.
lundy,
i
believe
that
the
options
afforded
are
misleading.
and
this
court
never...
never
intended
that
those
options
be
exercised
in
a
manner
that
would
forfeit
the
right...
result
in
a
forfeiture
of
the
right
to
federal
review.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
well,
it
appears
that...
that
beginning
with
the
line
of
cases,
rose
starts
a
line
of
cases.
two
other
significant
ones
are
this
court's
opinions
in
slack
and
in
martinez
which
affirmed
a
right
of
return
following
exhaustion.
and
it
said
that
that
right
of
return,
where
the
first
petition
was
filed
without
a
determination
on
the
merits
because
either--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--yes,
exactly.
but
they
were
not...
but
the
ensuing
application
was
not
deemed
to
be
second
or
successive
and
it
approved
a
right
return.
in
this...
in
this
particular
case,
the
operation
of...
the
impact
of
aedpa
on
rose
v.
lundy
operates
as
a
bar
to
the
right
of
return
in
the
event
the
defendant
files
a
mixed
petition.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
that's
true,
but
congress
also
never
prohibited
the
choices
that
have
been
afforded
under
rose.
and
in
order
to
implement
those
choices,
i
believe
an
additional
sentence
is
necessary
and
is
made
critical
by
the
adoption
for
the
first
time
of
a
1-year
limitations
period
in
order
to
ensure
that
prisoners
do
not
lose
this
very
important
right
to
federal
writ
relief.
as
far
as
the
operation
of
the
relation
back
doctrine
under
rule
15(c),
i
believe
that
that
was
a
remedial
device
that
was
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
order
to
restore
mr.
ford--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--that's
true.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
unless,
of
course,
one
follows
the
rationale
of
the
opinion,
which
is
that
the
petitions
should
have
been
stayed
not
dismissed,
and
therefore
to
restore
mr.
ford
to
the
position
he
was
in
previously--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--that's
true,
and
other
cases
faced
with
that
kind
of
situation
have
either
used
their
equitable
authority
to
reinstate
the
improperly
dismissed
petitions
or
have
used
the
doctrine
of
nunc
pro
tunc,
either
of
which
would
be
available.
in
any
event,
the
ninth
circuit--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--in
anthony
v.
cambra,
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
used.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
no,
i
don't
believe
it
has,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
the
reason
for
that
is
because
this
is
a
relatively...
this
case...
this
is
the
first
case
to
have
gone
this
far.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
yes,
taking--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
well--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--well,
first
of
all,
he
loses
precious
time.
most
of
these
litigants
believe
that
they're...
they've
been
unfairly
convicted.
many
are
serving
life
terms,
and
they
want
to
have...
they're
interested
in
expeditious
resolution
of
their
claim.
they
want
to
do
it
right.
they
want
to
have
their
claim
heard
on
the
merits
as
quickly
as
possible.
they're
not
interested
in
delay.
and
so,
they
would
not
choose
a
procedure
that
would
cause
them
to
return
to
state
court.
it's
not
in
their
interest
to
do
so.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
that's--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--i
don't
think
aedpa
contemplated
that...
well,
in
fact,
i
believe
aedpa
recognized
the
possibility
that
mixed
petitions
would
be
filed.
and
indeed,
the
exhaustion
requirement
is
an
extremely
difficult
one
both
for
lawyers
and
pro
se
litigants
alike.
by
the
time
a
judicial
determination
has
been
made,
on
average
263
days
go
by
after
that
federal
writ
petition
has
been
filed.
so
you
can
easily
have
a
situation
where
your
pro
se
litigant
filed
well
in
advance,
maybe
3
months
after
the
limitations
period
started,
only
the...
to
find
that
by
the
time
he...
a
judicial
determination
is
made,
that
he's
failed
to
exhaust
the--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--no.
in...
in
fact,
i
believe
that
that
condition
is
inherent
in
a
court's
discretionary
authority
to
stay.
it
can
take
into
consideration
a...
a
variety
of
factors,
including
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
has
been
diligent
in
exhausting.
the
reason--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--i
believe
it
already
does,
but
i...
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
no.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
no.
i
believe
one
of
them
would
be
that
i
didn't
receive
my
transcripts
from
my
state
appellate
attorney,
and
i
didn't
know
what
claims
were
there
because
i
didn't
receive
the
information.
the
other...
one
of
the
other
reasons--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--yes.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
well,
for
example,
a
defendant
may
have
had
a
direct
appeal,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
other
claims
such
as
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims,
which
normally
must
be
raised
in
a
writ,
have
been
pursued
at
all.
this
requires
reliance
on
extrajudicial
evidence.
normally
counsel,
at
least
in
california,
appointed
counsel
in
some
districts,
is
not
authorized
to
file
a
writ
petition
without
express
permission
of
the
court
of
appeal.
very
often
those
counsel
don't
pursue
that,
and
therefore
the
writable
issues,
the...
which
rely
on
extrajudicial
evidence,
have
not
been
developed,
and
they
have...
those
claims
have,
therefore,
not
been
exhausted.
so
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
a
pro
se
prisoner
litigant
may
find
that
certain
viable
claims,
meritorious
claims,
have
not
been
exhausted--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--no,
it
isn't,
but
your
honor--
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
--a
stay
is
discretionary,
and
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
stay
is
appropriate,
the
court
takes
into
factors
such
as
a
petitioner's
dilatoriness,
whether
or
not
they're
attempting
to
evade
a
time
limitation,
whether
or
not
their
efforts
are
in
good
faith.
i
believe
that
these
are
all
factors
that
the
district
courts
already
are
mindful
of.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
no.
i...
i
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
it
lacks
authority
to
stay
a
mixed
opinion.
i
believe
that
all
district
courts
have
the
inherent
authority
to
stay
a
mixed
opinion.
and
in
fact,
there's
considerable
authority
for
it
based
upon
this
court's
own
precedent.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
no.
i
believe
that
what
the
court
said,
in
a
circumstance...
it...
it...
i
agree
with
your
honor.
on
one
hand,
it
appears
to
speak
in
mandatory
terms.
on
the
other
hand,
i
believe
that
the
issue
that
there
may
potentially
be
a
forfeiture
of
the
right
to
federal
review
is
a
factor
which
the
district
court
must
also
take
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
enter
a
stay.
so
it's
just
one
additional
factor.
while
it
did
appear
that
the
ninth
circuit
spoke
in
mandatory
terms,
i
don't
believe
it's
mandated,
the...
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
a
district
court
should
stay
a
mixed
petition.
and
i
believe
it
also
has
authority
under
this
court's
decisions
in
nelson
and
in
wade
to
stay
an
unmixed
petition,
which
i
know
is
not
the
issue
before
us
with
regard
to
this
case.

well,
aedpa
was
supposed
to
simplify
things,
but
it
was
adopted
8
years
ago
and
we're
still
litigating
nearly
every
sentence
of
aedpa.
so
i
wish
it
had
simplified
things,
but
unfortunately,
it
is
not
a
simple
statute
to
understand.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
i
know
that
57
percent
of
the...
of
cases
are
dismissed
for
failure
to
exhaust.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
57.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
i
think
it's
all
over,
and
in
fact,
the
statistics
comes
from
this
court's
opinion
in
duncan,
and
i
believe
it's
justice
breyer's
opinion
where
he
cites
to
the
statistics.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
right,
for
failure
to
exhaust.
ms.
lisa
m.
bassis
so
what
i
am
proposing
is
that
the
court
permit...
approve
a
stay
of
mixed
petitions,
but
if
not,
that
it
gives
a
warning
to
pro
se
litigants
about
how
the
rose
choices
are
effectuated,
that
it
gives
the
rose
choices
and
then
it
continues
to
apprise
the
defendant
about
the
running
of
the
1-year
limitations
period,
and
that
they
essentially
must
calculate
the
limitations
period
on
their
own.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
