ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
given
the
federal
reserve
board
broad
authority
to
implement
the
truth
in
lending
act.
the
regulation
at
issue
here
is
the
permissible
exercise
of
that
authority.
the
board
has
addressed
the
disclosure
of
fees
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit
with
a
clear
bright
line
rule
which
requires
all
such
fees
to
be
disclosed
clearly
and
conspicuously
but
separately
from
the
finance
charge
and
apr.
to
use
the
court's
own
terminology,
that
approach
is
neither
obviously
repugnant
to
the
statute
nor
demonstrably
irrational.
to
the
contrary,
the
rule
is
a
sensible
one
that,
in
the
view
of
the
expert
agency,
provides
meaningful
disclosure
to
consumers
and
clear
guidance
to
creditors.
there's
no
merit
to
the
court
of
appeals'
and
respondent's
contrary
approach
which
would
only
impose
exorbitant
compliance
costs
on
creditors
without
any
meaningful
benefit
in
terms
of
disclosure
to
consumers.
the
board's
rule
is
not
foreclosed
by
the
statutory
text.
the
act
does
not
speak
expressly
to
whether
over-the-limit
fees
are
or
are
not
finance
charges.
nor
is
that
question
resolved
by
the
act's
generally
phrased
definition
of
finance
charges
as
charges
imposed
as
an
incident
to
the
extension
of
credit.
that
phrase
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
it
encompasses
charges
that
are
imposed
not
as
the
cost
of
the
credit
that
the
creditor
has
contractually
obligated
itself
to
provide,
but
instead
as
a
penalty
for
the
consumer's
obtaining
some
additional
credit
that
she
had
no
contractual
right
to
obtain.
the
board's
rule
is
rational.
as
the
board
recognized
over-the-limit
fees--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that
argument
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
the
relevant
provision
of
regulation
z,
which
is
at
page
2
of
the
petitioners'
brief,
contains
no
limit
of
that
sort.
it
speaks
of
charges
for
actual
unanticipated
late
payment
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit
and
for
delinquency,
default,
or
similar
occurrences.
it
thus
speaks
in
a
categorical
manner
of
charges
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit.
it
doesn't
condition
them
on
whether
it
was
unanticipated
or
whether
it's
tantamount
to
a
default.
the
board
has
acknowledged
that
there
are
hypothetical
situations
at
least
in
which
a...
a
charge
might
be
labeled
an
over-the-limit
charge
when
it
actually
is
not,
when
there
actually,
for
example,
is
no
contractual
credit
limit
and...
and
a
charge
is
simply,
in
that
context,
labeled
inaccurately
an
over-the-limit
fee.
however,
when
a
charge
is,
in
fact,
imposed
by
the
creditor
as
a
consequence
of
the
consumer's
exceeding
the
contractual
credit
limit,
it
is
validly
within
this
regulation.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's...
the
particular
account
at
issue
in
this
case
was
a
credit
card.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
it
does
impose
a
periodic
charge
if
charges
that
are
run
up
during
a
particular
month
are
not
paid
within
the
grace
period.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
don't
disagree
with
you,
justice
stevens,
that
it
is,
at
some
general
level,
a
charge
imposed
incident
to
the
extension
of
credit.
there
was
necessarily
an
extension
of
credit
here.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the...
but...
but
the
term,
incident
to
the
extension
of
credit,
is
an
ambiguous
one.
the
court
construed
similar
language
in
the
holly
farms
case
and
recognized
it
to
be
ambiguous.
it
doesn't
address
precisely
the
nature
or...
or
the
extent
to
which
a
particular
charge
has
to
be
connected
to
an
extension
of
credit.
and
here,
the
board
has
reasonably
viewed
over-the-limit
fees
like
late
payment
fees
and
other
default
fees
as
being
imposed
for
a
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
credit
agreement
rather
than
as--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--in
the
first
place,
there
was
no
communication
in
this
case,
and
there
typically
is
no
communication
when
we're
speaking
only
of
the
authorization
process.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
would
look
more
like
an
extension
of
credit,
i...
i
might
grant
you,
but
the
board
is
still
entitled
to
draft
categorical
rules
by
virtue
of
its
authority
under
section
1604(a)
to
make
classification
adjustments
and
exceptions.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
your
honor,
you're
raising
a
policy
question
that
congress
or
the
board
could
address
whether
additional
disclosures
are
required
at
the
point
of
purchase.
here
we're
talking
about
disclosures
that
occurred
later,
days
or
weeks
later,
when
the
customer
receives
her
periodic
statement.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
and
whether
it's
imposed
as
a
finance
charge
or...
or
as
an
other
charge,
the
consumer
is
still
going
to
have
the...
the
kind
of
surprise
that
you
referred
to.
and
in
the
board's
view,
it
doesn't
make
any
meaningful
difference
whether,
at
that
point
when
the
customer
receives
her
periodic
statement,
it
is
identified
as
one
or
the
other.
indeed,
it
could
confuse
the
consumer
to
have
the
over-the-limit
fee
included
in
the
historic
or
actual
apr
on
her
periodic
statement.
if
she
were,
for
example,
comparing
that
statement
with
a
solicitation
that
she
received
by
direct
mail,
she
might
be
inclined
to
think
that...
that
the
solicitation
offered
better
terms
when
it
really
did
not.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
your
honor.
she
would
still
have
to
pay
interest
on
it.
whether
it's
labeled
a
finance
charge
or
not
makes
no
difference
in
that
regard.
it
only
has
to
do
with
how
it's
labeled
and
whether
it's
included
in
the
actual
apr
on
the...
the
customer's
periodic
statement.
even
if
it's
labeled
a
finance
charge,
in
other
words,
she
can
be
charged
additional
interest.
the
periodic
rate
can
be
applied
to
it.
so,
in
fact,
the
board
has
concluded
that...
that
there's
no
benefit
to
consumers
to
treating
over-the-limit
fees
generally
as
finance
charges,
and
the
sixth
circuit's
rule,
in
particular,
would
make
no
sense
because
it
would
depend
on
the
creditor's
subjective
knowledge
whether
a
particular
charge
was
or
was
not
included
in
the
apr
in
the
particular
month.
that
would
impose
significant
compliance
costs
on
creditors
and
would
not
tell
consumers
anything
that's
particularly
meaningful
to
them.
when
the
board
revised
regulation
z
in
the
1980-81
period,
after
the
tila
simplification
act,
the
board
sought
to
focus
on
legally
enforceable
relationships,
not
on
unenforceable
understandings
that
a
consumer
might
have
as
a
result
of
a
course
of
dealings
with
the
credit
card
company.
and
understanding
this
particular
provision,
consistent
with
its
plain
terms,
as
applying
to
all
charges
imposed
or
exceeding
a
credit
limit
is
consistent
with
that
approach.
it
provides
the
meaningful
disclosure
and
it
avoids
imposing
unwarranted
compliance
costs.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
