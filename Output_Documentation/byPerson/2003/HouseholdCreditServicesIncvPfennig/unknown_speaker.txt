unknown
speaker
would
you
enlighten
us
on
just
how
this
transaction
gets
authorized
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
and
in
this
event?
is
there
any
special
call
made,
or
is
the
credit
card
just
submitted
to
the
store
and
the
store
processes
it
and
if
it's
not
rejected,
it
goes
through?
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
waxman,
is
it
not
true
that
there
are
many
occasions
on
which
the
credit
limit
will,
in
fact,
be
exceeded
and
there
will,
nevertheless,
come
back
an
approval,
and
that
the
customer
in
those
cases
may
or
may
not
know
that
his...
that,
a,
his
limit
was
exceeded,
and
b,
that
he's
going
to
be
charged
for
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
necessarily.
you
can
have
a
card
owned
by
two
or
three
people
in
the
same
family
and
maybe
the
husband
spent
some
money
that
the
wife
didn't
know
about
while
this
was
going
on.
so
it's
at
least
possible
that
they
would
exceed
the
credit
limit
without
the
credit
cardholder
knowing
it,
their
not
being
aware
of
it,
not
keeping
track
of
it.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
i'm
just
asking
you,
is
it
not
true
that
it
is
possible
that
he
will
receive
an
affirmative
answer
to
using
the
card
without
knowing
whether
or
not
he
exceeded
the
limit
and
therefore
is
going
to
be...
be
charged
for
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
if
the...
if
the
credit
card
issuer
is
informed
of
the
overcharge,
that
it's
over
the
limit,
and
decides
this
is
a
good
customer,
well,
let's
not
charge
him
for
it
or
let's
okay
it
anyway,
he
gives
that
information
to
the
merchant
and
the
merchant
may
not
tell
the
customer
anything
about
it.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
but
he
may
know.
unknown
speaker
that's
my
point.
unknown
speaker
the
credit
company
may
know
and
he
will
not
pass
that
information
on
to
the
consumer.
unknown
speaker
well,
am
i
correct
on
my
facts?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
possible?
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
consumer
may
end
up
paying
a
charge
that
he
didn't
realize
he'd
incurred.
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct
or
not?
unknown
speaker
if
he
has...
if
he
knows
two
things.
he
knows
the
fine
print
on
the
credit
agreement
and,
two,
he
knows
the
status
of
his
balance.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
doesn't
have
either
of
those
in
mind,
it
could
occur...
it
could
occur
that
he
would
run
an
overcharge
and
be
charged
$15
or
$20
or
whatever
it
is
without
realizing
he's
incurred
the
charge.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you're
unwilling
to
give
me
a
categorical
yes
answer
when
the
answer
is
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
given
me
lots
of
examples
where
the
charge
would
not
be
incurred.
i'm
merely
trying
to
get
you
to
acknowledge
there
will
be
some
cases
in
which
a
person
who
is
not
fully
familiar
with
the...
with
the
balance
in
his
account
doesn't
realize
he's
gone
over
the
amount
and
is
being
charged
for
an
extra
credit
charge.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
mr.
waxman,
exactly
what
happens
when
a
point-of-sale
transaction
is
authorized?
the
merchant
is
then
off
the
hook?
unknown
speaker
mr.
waxman,
is...
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
is
the...
is
the
event
of
exceeding
the...
the
limit
defined
in
these
agreements
characteristically
as
an
event
that
can
occur
at
any
time
during
the
billing
period,
or
is
it
an
event
that
is
defined
as...
as
occurring
only
at
the
end
of
the
billing
period
when
all
the
credits
and...
and
all
the
debits
are...
are
accounted
for?
unknown
speaker
mr.
waxman,
will
you
explain
what
the
consequence
is?
it's...
this
is
not
a
question
of
disclosure
or
not
because
either
it
will
be
part
of
the
finance
charge
and
disclosed
as
such
or
the...
whatever
you
call
ocl.
what
difference
does
it
make?
it's
not
notice.
if
it
goes...
if
it's
part
of
the
finance
charge,
how
is
the
consumer
benefitted?
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
solicitation
for
a
purchase
of
a
credit
card
or
for
purchase
of
merchandise?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
thing
it
could
occur
to.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
it
a
consequence
of...
of
the
other
position
that
they
would
somehow
have
to
try
to
do
the
impossible?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
other...
other
instances
in
the
act
where
the
apr,
calculated
retroactively
on
the
monthly
statement,
is
higher
than
what
was
the
apr
that
was
disclosed?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
then
the
respondent's
theory
could...
and
that's
consistent
with
the
act,
i
take
it.
so
then
respondent's
theory
could
work.
my
concern
was
that
respondent's
theory
couldn't
work
because
you
had...
couldn't
hypothetically
calculate
an
annual
percentage
rate
not
knowing
whether
charge
would
be
made.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
can
and...
and
do
have
an
adjustment
of
the
apr
that's
permitted
under
the
act,
on
the
disclosure
statement,
then
her
theory
at
least
can
work.
unknown
speaker
mr.
waxman,
i
don't
think
you
finished
the
answer
to
the
question
i
asked,
and
what
i
wanted
to
know
is
if
it's
labeled
a
finance
charge,
then
there
won't
be
interest
on
it;
whereas,
if
it's
treated
as
a
debit
like
any
purchase,
then
the
interest
would
run
on
it
in
the
future.
so
could...
it
could
be
a
difference
for
the
consumer,
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
it
could
be...
it
could
be--
--why
isn't
it
carried
over
from
month
to
month?
in
other
words,
i...
i
get
a
late...
this...
this
special
charge,
but
i
just
pay
the
minimum,
so
i'm
really
carrying
part
of
the
special
charge
over
to
the
next
month.
i
pay
interest
on
that
too,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
waxman.
ms.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
mcdowell?
unknown
speaker
would
you...
as
i
understand
the
respondent's
brief,
it
asks
us
to
draw
a
line
between
the
over-the-limit
fees
that
are
imposed
for
acts
of
default
and
those
that
are
imposed
for
extension
of
the
credit
limit
and
says
that
regulation
z
draws
such
a
distinction.
would
you
comment
on
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
was
this
an
account
that
carried
a
finance
charge?
because
the
regulations
describe
something
called
charge
card
that
doesn't
have
finance
charge,
but
could
have
an
over-the-limit
charge.
unknown
speaker
which
did
have
a
finance
charge,
or
you
don't
know?
unknown
speaker
if
i
understand
the
other
side,
they
make
kind
of
a
plain
language
argument.
they...
they
talk
to
the
merchant.
the
merchant
sends
in...
they
want
approve
a
$200
purchase
and
they
get
back,
well,
it'll
go
over
the
limit
and
is
it
okay.
and
they
say,
yes,
let
them
go
over
the
limit,
and
so
they've
extended
additional
credit.
and...
and
they,
if
they're
going
to
charge
them
$15
to
do
it,
that
would
be
a
finance
charge...
i
mean,
that
would
be
a
charge
for
an
extension
of
credit.
why
doesn't
it
fit
the
plain
language?
unknown
speaker
in...
in
exchange
for
the
higher
credit
limit,
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the...
but
wouldn't
the
customer
say,
well,
i
didn't
violate
anything?
you
told
me
i
could
do
it.
why
is
it
a
violation?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
there
were...
what
if
there
had
been
a
communication?
would
it
be
different?
would
it
be
a
different
case
if
the
merchant
put
the
bank
officer
on
the
phone
and
said,
you're
over
your
limit,
and
the...
and
the
customer
said,
is
it
okay
for
me
to
pay
the
extra
15
bucks
for
this...
go
over
the
limit
$15?
he
says,
yes,
we'll...
we'll
okay
it.
and
then
they
hang
up.
at
the
end
of
the
month,
he
gets
a
$15
charge
for
that.
would
that
be...
that
would
not
be
an
extension
of
credit
in
your
view
if
they
talked
on
the
phone
and
agreed
to
it
instead
of
having
to
just
go
through
these
anonymous
communications.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
duty
on
the...
on
the
part
of
the
bank
to
say,
of
course,
if
we
okay
it,
you
have
to
pay
an
extra
15
bucks.
unknown
speaker
just
a
bill
that
said,
you
didn't
realize
it,
but
you
just
earned
a...
you
just...
you
owe
us
$15
that
you
should
have
realized.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that...
that
it
would
be
to
the
consumer's
advantage
to
have
this
categorized
as
a
finance
charge
because
then
she
wouldn't
have
to
pay
interest
on
that
in...
in
future
charges?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell.
ms.
goldsmith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
are...
are
you
fully
defending
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit,
ms.
goldsmith?
unknown
speaker
ms.
goldsmith,
before
you
continue,
the
sixth
circuit
said
a
portion
of
regulation
z
is
invalid
because
it's
incompatible
with
the
statute.
are
you
defending
that
invalidation?
unknown
speaker
how
about
in
practice?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
you
asked...
you
asked
the
court
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
when
you
argued
the
case
before
the
sixth
circuit,
you
made
it
very
clear
that
you
were
seeking
a
holding
that
a
portion
of
regulation
z
was
incompatible
with
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
an
argument
you
didn't
make
before
the
sixth
circuit.
the
sixth
circuit...
you
told
them
that
this
regulation
was
incompatible
with
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
they
clarified
it
in
the
sixth
circuit.
so
why
didn't
you
say,
oh,
sixth
circuit,
we've
now
seen
the
light
and
we...
we
don't
want
the
regulation
declared
invalid?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
used
the
word
review.
we
wouldn't
be
reviewing
it.
we
would
be
taking
a
first
view
of
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't...
you...
we
would
not
be
reviewing
anything
that
the
court
below
determined.
we
would
be
accepting
a
new
argument
that
has
not
been
aired
below,
and
that's
not
review.
unknown
speaker
usually
if
we're
asked
to
affirm
on
an
alternate
ground,
it's
a
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
as
kind
of
an
alternate
ground.
here,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
pass
on
this
at
all.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
just
a
procedural
point,
ms.
goldsmith.
we
do
better
if
we
have
an
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
subject
than
if
we're
just
launching
it
into...
for
the
first
time
ourselves.
unknown
speaker
what
other
argument
is
there?
i
don't
understand.
i
thought...
and
i'm
just
mixed
up
about
this.
i
thought
that
there
is
a
z
regulation.
it's
called
regulation
z.
and
i
thought
regulation
z
says
the
following
is
not
part
of
the
finance
charge,
a
charge
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit.
now,
are
we
talking
about
something
in
this
case
that
is
not
a
charge
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
does
it
say
on
the
paper
this
is
a
charge
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
and
so
it's
called
an
over-limit
fee
assessment
and
you
pay
it
if
you
exceed
the
credit
limit.
you
don't
pay
it
if
you
exceed
the
credit
limit,
or
do
you?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
well,
what
is
the
answer
to
the
factual
question?
do
you
pay
for
exceeding
the
credit
limit
or
do
you
not
pay
it
for
exceeding
the
credit
limit?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so--
--it
depends,
doesn't
it,
on--
--there's
a
new
argument,
the
first
time
in
this
court,
that
this
is
not
a
fee
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit.
was
it
made
below
in
any
form?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes,
but,
i
mean...
that
may
be.
i'm
just
asking,
have
you
ever
told
any
court
before
today
that
this
is
not
the...
i'm
not...
it
sounds
sarcastic,
but
i
don't
mean
it
to
be
sarcastic.
i
want
to
know.
have
you
ever
before
argued
in
this
case,
told
a
judge
and...
that
this
is
not
a
fee,
quote,
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit?
end
quote.
unknown
speaker
no.
ms.
goldsmith,
we
wouldn't
resolve
a
whole
lot
in
this
case,
however,
if
we
didn't
reach
that
question,
would
we?
unknown
speaker
we...
we'd
just
have
another
case
a
little
bit
down
the
line,
perhaps
with
the
same
parties
before
the
court,
arguing
this...
this
follow-on
question.
right?
unknown
speaker
if
we
don't
resolve
it,
we've
essentially
wasted
our
time.
what...
what...
doesn't
it
depend
upon
what
the
regulation
means
by
credit
limit?
it
could
mean
that
limit
set
forth
in
the...
in
the
agreement
with
the
credit
card
company,
past
which
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
company
to
extend
you
any
further
credit.
it
could...
it
could
reasonably
mean
that.
indeed,
that...
that's
what
i
would
normally
think
it
does
mean.
or
it
could
mean
what
you
want
it
to
mean,
whatever
limit
the
company
later
places
upon
your
desire
to...
to
go
ahead.
now,
why
should
we
accept
your
interpretation
of
it
rather
than
the
interpretation
of
the
agency?
we
usually
do
accept
the
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulation.
unknown
speaker
we
wouldn't
be
arguing
here.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--well,
don't
we
have
to
accept
the
government's
position?
it's
representing
the
agency,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
the
agency
position.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
government's
argument
in
my...
as
i
read
it.
i
thought
there
are
some
words
here.
for
exceeding
a...
it
says,
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit.
and
as
i
understood
the
argument...
i
might
not
have
perfectly
well...
is...
i
thought
that
their
argument
is
basically
when
you
exceed
a
credit
limit,
the
company
doesn't
want
you
to
do
it.
okay?
so
it
says,
no.
and
if
you
do
it,
we're
not
going
to
cancel
you
out,
but
we
will
charge
you
a
penalty.
now,
sometimes
it's
what
you
say.
sometimes
the
company
would
love
you
to
do
it
and
get
the
extra
money.
in
fact,
they
might
make
profits
on
that.
so
they'd
love
you
to
do
it.
but
trying
to
distinguish
between
those
two
instances
is
too
difficult,
and
because
it's
too
difficult,
we
are
going
to
have
a
blanket
rule,
and
the
blanket
rule
is
if
you
fall
within
these
words,
exceeding
a
credit
limit,
this
is
not
a
finance
charge.
now,
that's
what
i
understood
it
to
be,
a
typical
administrative
agency
argument.
and
they
say
chevron,
mead,
et
cetera,
we
win.
all
right.
now,
suppose
let
me...
for
the
purpose
of
answering,
please
assume
that
you
do
have
a
charge
here
that
falls
within
the
term,
exceeding
a
credit
limit.
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument
that
i
just
made?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
say
the
agency
said
this?
where...
where
did
the
agency
say
that?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
portion
of
the
regulation
says
that?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
depends
on
what...
what
time
period
unanticipated
refers
to.
unknown
speaker
okay.
what
does
the
commentary
say?
unknown
speaker
where...
where
is
that
in...
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
gee,
if
it's
that
central,
i
would
have
thought
it
ought
to
have
been
there.
it's
new
to
me.
where...
where
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know
what
you
just
said?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sort
of.
i...
i'd
like
to
know
what
it
is
that
you're...
you're
saying
makes
your
case.
i...
i
don't
have
the
text
in
front
of
me
and
you
say
it's
nowhere
to
be
found
in
all
of
these
voluminous
materials
that
we
have
for
this
case.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
if...
if
you
are
correct
in
your
analysis,
why
isn't
the
answer
to
the
problem
that
you
raise
here
is
simply
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
charge
you
any
fee
at
all,
no
matter
what
you
call
it?
because
if
i
understand
your...
and
i
may
not,
but
if
i
understand
your
argument,
your
argument
is
they
agreed
to
my
charging
beyond
the
limit
in
the
agreement
as
we
originally
negotiated
it.
they
said
it's
okay.
and
if
that
is
the
case,
why
isn't
your
argument
and
your
remedy
simply
they
can't
charge
me
any
penalty
at
all
for
that?
they
agreed
to
it.
and
we
never
even
get
into
the
question
that
we've
got
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
but
if
your
point...
and
i
think
i'm
not
getting
your
point,
but
if
your
point
is
that
they
approved
this
in
the
sense
that
they
said,
yes,
we
will
honor
this...
they're
telling
you
in...
in
effect...
we
will
honor
this
charge
and
that
that,
in
effect,
is
a
renegotiation
of
your
credit
limit
with
the
bank,
then
it
would
follow
that
they
can't
charge
you
any
penalty
at
all.
the
only
thing
they
can
make
you
do
is
pay
what
you
have
charged.
and
if
that's
the
case,
we
don't
need
to
get
into
this...
this
complicated
question
about
regulation
z.
all
you
have
to
say
is,
i
don't
owe
you
a
cent
for
exceeding
the
credit
limit.
why
isn't
that
the
answer
to
your
question
or
to
your
problem?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying,
yes,
it
violates
the
contract,
but
it's
okay
to
violate
the
contract
because
they...
they
approved
in
advance
this
charge.
unknown
speaker
then
if
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
contract
because
they
allowed
you
to
do
it,
why
do
you
concede
that
they
can
charge
you
any
fee
at
all
for
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
they
may,
but
in
the
original
contract
with
you
in
the...
the...
at
the...
at
the
beginning
of
your
relationship
with
the
bank,
they
didn't
spell
out
the
particular
situation
that
you're
describing
here.
they
said,
in...
if
i
understand
it,
if
you
go
over
the
limit,
we
charge
you
x
dollars,
and...
and
that
was
the
extent
of
it.
you're
fighting
about
whether
the
x
dollars
should
be
classified
as
a
finance
charge
or
something
else,
but
your
argument
now
is
a
different
kind
of
argument.
your
argument
now
is
they,
in
some
sense,
approved
my
going
over
the
limit.
if
that
does
not
change
the
original
agreement,
then
what
difference
does
it
make?
if
it
does
change
the
original
agreement,
then
why
isn't
your
remedy
simply
to
say
you
can't
charge
me
a
fee
at
all
for
going
over
the
limit?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
your...
your
argument
is
that
the
extension
of
credit
in
this
case
is
an
agreement
to
exceed
the
credit
limit.
isn't
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
argument,
ms.
goldsmith,
was
that
the
contract
provides
that
any
extension
of
credit
over
the
credit
limit
shall
be
subject
to
the
regular
percentage
plus
the
$15
penalty.
right?
i
mean,
you
acknowledge
that
there
is
an
agreement
at
the
outset
as
to
what
the
finance
charge
will
be
for
this
added
extension
of
credit.
it'll
be
the
regular
rate
plus
the
penalty.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
not
your
argument,
then...
then
i
think
justice
souter
has
to
be
correct.
unknown
speaker
didn't...
didn't
ms.
pfennig
get
a
copy?
i
mean,
the...
isn't
it
on
her
monthly
bill?
unknown
speaker
i
thought...
i
thought
the
terms
have
to
be
disclosed
monthly
in
addition
to
when
the
credit
card
is
new.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that's
not
in
the
record,
how
can
you
make
the
argument
you're
making?
because
the
argument
you're
making
depends
on
whether,
in
effect,
the...
the
agreement
is
justice
scalia's
suggestion
or
my
suggestion.
and
if
that's
not
in
the
record
and
you
don't
know,
how
do
we
get
into
this
at
all?
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
way
we
can
tell
that
is
to
look
at
the
contract,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
just
an
ordinary
credit
card
transaction
where
you
go
in
and
say,
look,
i'm
buying
a
pair
of
gloves
and
i
want
to
put
them
on
my
credit
card?
this
you're
describing
as
a
request
for
an
extension
of
credit?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
we're
starting
back
that
simply.
then
how
did
we
get
so
complicated?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
reason
it's
complicated,
if
i
understand
your
position,
you're
objecting
both
to
the
fee
and
to
the
later
statements
imposing
an
interest
charge
on
the
fee,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
in
the
contract,
so
what?
a
deal
is
a
deal.
if
you
agree,
i
pay
10
percent
up
to
this
amount,
if
i
go
over
that
amount,
i
pay
10
percent
plus
$15,
if
that's
in
the
contract,
isn't
that
perfectly
fair?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
know
whether
it's
in
the
contract.
so
you
can't
say
it's
unfair.
unknown
speaker
whether
it
is
or
not,
you
shouldn't
call
it
unfair
if
you
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
could
i
interrupt
with
this
one
question?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
it
out
before
the
argument
is
over.
would
you
explain
to
me
what
difference
it
makes,
in
terms
of
notice
to
the
consumer,
whether
one
calls
it
a...
an
other
charge
or
a
finance
charge?
in
either
event,
doesn't
the
consumer
get
exactly
the
same
notice?
unknown
speaker
but
why
would
the
consumer
understand
the
cost
of
credit
any
better
by
labeling
it
a
finance
charge
rather
than
an
other
charge?
that
i
haven't...
you
haven't
explained
to
me.
unknown
speaker
so
how
does
that
work?
i...
i
exceed
my
credit
by
$15.
my
colleague
exceeds
his
credit
by
$42.
each
of
us
is
charged
a
$15
late
fee.
what's
the
interest
rate?
and,
of
course,
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
possibilities.
so
i
guess
i'd
get
a...
a
statement
that
would
be
every
conceivable
possibility
of
how
much
i
go
over
with
interest
rates
ranging
from
like.2
percent
to
48,000
percent.
so,
i
mean,
how...
how
is
this
supposed
to
work?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
why
justice
stevens
might
have
thought
it's
going
to
confuse
the
consumer
if
you
win,
not
help
the
consumer.
i
would
think
it's
much
more
informative
to
the
consumer
to
know
that
my
interest
rate
for
all
of
the
things
up
to
the...
my
credit
limit
has
been
this
past
month
so
much,
and...
and
then
see
a
separate
charge,
god,
i
got
socked
15
bucks
for
going
over
my
credit
limit.
you
think
you're
helping
the
consumer
by...
by
taking
that
$15
separate
charge
and
just
mushing
it
into
the
general
overall
credit
limit
so
that
instead
of
thinking
he's
being
charged
10
percent,
he
thinks
he's
being
charged
11...
11
percent,
and
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
the
late...
about
the...
the
going
over
his
over
limit
fee?
i
don't
think
that
helps
him
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
the
difficulty
for
you
is
all
you
have
to
say
is
that
the
view
i
was
taking
somewhat
by
argument
is
a
reasonable
one,
and
if
it's
a
reasonable
one,
i
guess
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
therefore,
regulation
z
doesn't
violate
it.
now...
now,
you
haven't
been
able
to
show
us
how
we'd
get
on
the
opposite
interpretation.
we
didn't
even
know
what
the
statement
would
look
like.
so
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
say
it's
not
reasonable
what
the...
what
the...
that
regulation
z,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
one
thing
that
the...
the
board
has
said
is
we
don't
want
these
individual
to
make
every
extension
of
credit
or
what...
to
do
this
kind
of
thing
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
that's
why
we're
establishing
these
categories.
and
your
interpretation
was
making
the
credit
card
company
has
to
know
and
every
one
is
going
to
be
a
knock-down,
drag-out,
specific
facts
of
the
case.
and
that's
exactly,
it
seems
to
me,
what
the
board
didn't
want
to
have
happen.
unknown
speaker
now
you're
going
back
to
the
regulation
itself
is
no
good.
unknown
speaker
ms.
mcdowell
said
that...
that
in
dollars
and
cents,
there's
no
difference
to
the
customer
using...
there
is
a
dollars
and
cents
difference,
i
take
it,
and
would
you
explain
what
it
is?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you've
answered
it.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
