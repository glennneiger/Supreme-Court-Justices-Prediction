ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
has
come
full
circle.
it
started
4-and-a-half
years
ago
with
the
filing
of
a
complaint,
a
complaint
that
says
if
you
authorize
the
request
of
a
consumer
to
have
more
credit
and
you
tie
a
fee
for
that
authorization,
that
fee
is
a
finance
charge.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
or
not
the
sixth
circuit
has
the
right
or
should
have
invalidated
a
provision
of
regulation
z
with
respect
to
the
exclusion
of
certain
over-limit
fees,
and
we
believe
that
resolution
of
that
question
brings
us
back
to
the
complaint.
what
does
the
complaint
say
in
that
regard?
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
we...
yes.
we
believe
that
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
is
that
this
fee,
the
fee
in
this
case,
is
a
finance
charge,
and
we
stand
behind
that
decision
100
percent.
we
have
stated
in
our
complaint
that
this
fee...
and...
and
it's
important
to
remember
that--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--in
theory,
yes.
we...
we
feel
that--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--we
feel
that
perhaps
the
court
did
not
need
to
go
there,
that...
in...
in
looking
at
the
situation
now,
we...
we
have
always--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--yes,
we
did.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
think
to
the
extent
that
regulation
z
says
that
anything
you
call
an
over-limit
fee
as
excluded
from
the
finance
charge,
that
is
incompatible
with
the
regulation.
and
we
stand
by
our
lower
court
argument
that
if
that
is
the
case,
then
that
regulation
cannot
stand.
and...
and
once
the
government
stepped
in,
we
realized...
a
significant
part
of
their
argument
is
that
the...
that
the
federal
reserve
board
could
say
that.
the
federal
reserve
board
could
say
that
all
over-limit
fees
are
excluded
from
the
finance
charge
and
we
took
that
as
a...
as
a
tacit
concession
that
the...
the
federal
reserve
board
didn't
actually
do
that.
what
they
said,
within
the
context
of
section
226.4(c)(2),
is
that
fees,
penalty
fees,
fees
for
unilateral
acts
of
default,
need
not
be
disclosed
as
part
of
the
finance
charge.
and
so
while
we
support
the
sixth
circuit's
decision,
this
is
a
finance
charge...
no
matter
how
you
get
there,
you
have
to
get
to
that
point...
alternately,
as
an
alternate
basis
to
support
the
decision,
we
realize
that
the
regulation
is
not
necessarily
triggered
in
this
instance.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
that
is
correct.
and
i...
i
have
to
fall
on
the
sword
in
that
regard,
that
honestly,
until
the
government
stepped
in
and
helped
clarify
that
issue
for
us,
we
did...
we
were
fighting
a
battle
we
didn't
need
to
fight.
and
ultimately--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
don't
believe
that
the
government
clarified
that
for
us
in
the
sixth
circuit.
what...
what
clarified
it
for
me
was
the
government's
brief,
the
merit
briefing
in
this
case,
where
they
said,
i
believe
28
pages
into
a
30-page
brief,
if
the
federal
reserve
board
wants
to
exclude
all
over-limit
fees,
they
could,
and
that's
sort
of
when
the
light
bulb
went
off.
they
didn't.
and
that...
that's
sort
of
what
took
us
where
we
are.
and
ultimately,
i
think
there's
precedent
for
this
court
to
review
the
ultimate
basis
to
support
this
decision
based
on
making
sure
that
the--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
think
that
in
connecticut
v.
door,
for
instance,
this
court
acknowledged
that
there
are
circumstances
that
this
court
wants
to
make
sure
that
the
right
rule
of
law
is
handed
down.
and
if
the
questions
are
intertwined,
the...
the
issues
that
were
raised
below
and
an
alternate
argument
in
support
of
the
decision
is
raised
before
this
court,
if
it's
a
matter
of
importance,
if
it's
a
matter
that
the
lower
courts
need
direction
on,
if
it's
a
matter
that
has
been--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
agree.
and
like
i
said,
i...
i
believe
in
the
connecticut
v.
door
case,
this
court
acknowledged
that
alternately
we
cannot
put
form
over
substance,
and
we
need
to
make
sure
that
the
right
rule
of
law
is
passed
down.
and
i
believe
justice
scalia,
as
a
concurring
comment
in
u.s.
v.
burke,
said
there's
got
to
be
play
in
the
joints,
that
even
if
it
is
not
something
that
came
to
the
court
procedurally,
if
it
is
something
that...
that
meets
the
three
factors
i
was
enumerating
from
connecticut
v.
door,
the
court
will
entertain
an
argument.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
and
i
would
agree,
and...
and
the
only
defense
that
i
have
to
that
is
that
this
is
a
matter
that
has
been
fully
briefed
and
argued
by
counsel
before
this
court.
and
when...
when
the
case
got
taken
in
by
this
court,
everyone
said
to
me,
you
have
to
remember
why
they
took
it
in,
and...
and
my
understanding
is
is
because
the
regulation
has
been
challenged.
and--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
believe
so.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
think
that
a
fee
denominated
an
over-limit
fee
that
is
actually
an
anticipated
cost
for
approving
an
extension
of
credit
is
in
fact
a
finance
charge.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
believe
they
called
it
an
over-limit
fee
assessment.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
think
that's
a
factual
question.
i...
i
think--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
believe
the
facts
of
this
case...
this
is
not
a
fee
that
was
imposed
for
the
unilateral
act
of
exceeding
a
credit
limit.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
believe
the
allegations
of
our
complaint
have
always
been
clear.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
no.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
don't
believe
we
would.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
believe
absolutely.
i
think
that
what
we
realized
is
that
the
arguments
that
we
were
making
in
the
court
below,
which...
which
we
stand
by,
were
premature.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
don't
believe
that
our
interpretation
conflicts
with
that
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
if...
if
we
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
believe
what
the...
what
the
federal
reserve
board
has
said
is
that
when
you
have
a
fee
for
a
unilateral
act
of
default,
that
that
fee
is
properly
excluded
from
finance
charge.
i
believe
in
the--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--absolutely.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
don't
believe
that
you
will
find
in
the
government's
brief
an
argument
that
the
fee
alleged
in
this
case
necessarily
fits
within
the
terms
of
section
226.4(c)(2).
in
fact,
i
believe
several
times,
pages
17,
18
of
the
government's
brief,
they
talk
about
how
over-limit
fees
were
included
as
a
penalty
fee
in
that
portion
of
the
regulation.
that
gets
us
back
to
the
complaint.
was
the
fee
charged
here
a
penalty
fee
or
was
it
a
fee
for
an
anticipated,
approved
extension
of
credit?
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
think
if
we
assume
that
this
fee
is
a
fee
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit,
then
we
need
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
fee
and
determine
whether
or
not
that
is
obviously
repugnant
to
the
statute.
and
i
think
part
of...
of
what
we
have
been
accused
of
doing
is
creating
an
impossible
factual
distinction.
some
would
be
disclosed
as
a
finance
charge,
some
would
not.
and
i
direct
the
court
to
the
regulation
itself
that
draws
that
factual
distinction
as
to
late
fees.
the...
the
federal
reserve
board
went
out
of
its
way,
in
both
the
language
of
the
regulation
and
the
commentary,
to
say
if
this
is
a
unilateral
act
of
default,
you
have
paid
late
or
not
in
the
amount
that
you
were
supposed
to
pay
and
we
absolutely
did
not
authorize
that,
that
must...
that
would
be
excluded
from
the
finance
charge.
but
if
the
creditor
acquiesced
in
that
in
any
way,
that
is
a
finance
charge.
and
what
our
position
is
is
that
a
late
fee--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--in
both
the
regulation
itself
and
the
commentary.
in
the
commentary--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--that's
in
226.4(c)(2)
in
the
portion
that
says
actual
unanticipated
late
payments.
and
in
the
commentary,
the...
the
board
has
defined
actual,
and
it's
the
qualification
of
actual
unanticipated
goes
to
the
question
is
this
a
unilateral
act
of
default
or
is
this
something
that
the
creditor
acquiesced
in.
so
our...
our
point
is
is
that
if
you
look
at--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
believe
that
the
commentary
helps
explain
that
for
us.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
the
commentary
says
if
this
is
truly
a
late
fee
because
you
have
paid
and
the
creditor
could
do
nothing
about
it,
then
that
is
going
to
be
an
actual
unanticipated
late
fee.
but
if
this
is
something
that
month
after
month
after
month
you
paid
late
every
month
and
they
could
be
deemed
to
have
acquiesced
in
that
late
payment,
that
must
be
disclosed
as
part
of
the
finance
charge.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
the
portion
of
the
commentary...
to
be
perfectly
honest,
i
don't
know
if
the...
if
the
commentary
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix.
the
regulation
language
is--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
don't
know
where
in
the
appendix
it
is
is
what
i
don't
know.
i
know
that
section
226.4(c)(2)...
the
commentary
specifically
outlines
the
fact
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
acts
of
default
and...
and
acquiesced...
oh,
thank
you
very
much.
what
counsel
was
handing
me
is
the
actual
c.f.r..
i
mean,
the
commentary
that
follows
c.f.r.
section
226.4(c)(2).
what
i
don't
believe
is
that
is
reprinted
in
full
anywhere
in
the
appendix
or
in
the
briefing.
i
thought
that's
what
your
question
was.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
was
trying
to
give
an
analogy
as
to
late
fees
which
is
somewhat
tangential
to
the
issue.
what
the
point
is
is
that
a
late
fee...
you
have
to
start
with
what
the
concept
of
an
extension
of
credit
is.
and...
and
we
do
outline
this
in
our
brief,
that
we're
talking
about
each
and
every
time
a
consumer
seeks
to
make
a
purchase,
they're
essentially
saying
may
i
have
an
extension
of
credit
to
cover
the
purchase.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
is
is
that
this
is
really
no
different
than
a
request
to...
to...
a
request
to
make
a
purchase
below
the
credit
limit
versus
a
request
to
make
a
purchase
above
it.
either
way,
they
could
charge
you
a
fee.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
what--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--credit
is.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
think
two
things.
first
of
all,
we
have
never
claimed
that
this
is
a
renegotiation
of
the
credit
limit.
we
have
always
taken
the
position
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
renegotiating
your
credit
limit
and
getting
an
extension
of
credit
that
happens
to
take
you
over
your
credit
limit.
so
that...
that's
the
first
issue.
the
second
issue
is--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--we
do
not
feel
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
contract
if
they
allow
you
to
do
it.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i'm
not
conceding
that
they
can
charge
you
a
penalty
on
top
a
finance
charge,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
anytime
a
creditor
extends
credit,
they
may
charge
a
fee
and--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--as
a
credit.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
believe
what
we
have
always
said
is
that
this
extension
of
credit
was
like
any
other
extension
of
credit
on
the
card.
whether
ms.
pfennig
goes
in
2
weeks
before
her...
her
credit
limit
was
exceeded
and
says,
may
i
have
enough
credit
to
make
this
purchase,
and
they
say,
yes,
and
contractually
we
know--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
don't
think
so.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
don't--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
think
at
this
stage
of...
of
the
litigation,
since
we
have
not
conducted
any
discovery,
we
have
not
seen
the
actual
cardholder
agreement
to
know
what
it
says
with
regard
to
over-limit
fees.
so
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
the
question
in
that
regard.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
on
her
bill
it
will
tell
her
what
her
contract
rate
is,
but
the
initial
disclosures...
i
believe
she
had
this
card
7-8
years
before
this
happened
and
it
is
not
in
the
record.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
what
has
to
be...
and...
and
i
believe
that...
that
mr.
waxman
explained
this,
but
you
have
your
initial
disclosures
that
come
with
the
card
when
you
originally
get
it.
what
has
to
be
disclosed
on
a
periodic
basis
is
an
itemization
of
each
extension
of
credit
that
you've
received,
a
total
that
you've
received,
plus
your...
your
apr.
those
types
of
terms
of
what
the
cost
of
credit
is
on
a
monthly
basis
are
going
to
be
on
your
periodic
statement.
i
believe
what...
what
justice
scalia's
question
was
is
what
does
the
credit
card
agreement
say
as
to
is
she
going
to
be
charged
a
flat
fee,
is
she
going
to
be
charged
a
flat
fee
plus
the
finance
charge,
and
that
is
not
in
the
record.
we
don't
have
that.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
think
the
confusion
is
coming
in
because
ultimately
what
is
or
is
not
labeled
in
an
over-limit
fee
may
not
be
a
fee
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit
as
that
term
has
been
used
in
the
regulations.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
don't
believe
so.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
section
1637(b)(2)
that
describes
how
each
and
every
extension
of
credit
needs
to
be
itemized,
we're
talking
about
a
singular
event,
an
extension
of
credit.
she
says
may
i
make
this
purchase.
may
i
have
an
extension
of
credit
to
cover
this
purchase,
and
they
say
yes.
and
in
everyday
experience,
we
all
know
that
means
you're
going
to
be
charged
something
for
that
extension
of
credit.
it's
going
to
be
charged
a
finance
charge.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
absolutely.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i'm
not
quite
sure.
[laughter]
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
i
think
it's
triple
dipping,
yes.
i
think
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
they...
they
charge
you
for
the
extension
of
credit.
you
get
a
finance
charge
on
your
actual
extension
of
credit.
they
impose
a
penalty
fee,
and
then
they
charge
a
finance
charge
on
the
penalty
fee--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
think--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--but
this
is
not
a
breach
of
contract
case.
this
is
a
truth
in
lending
act
case,
and
the
only
thing
the
truth
in
lending
act--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
don't
recall
using
the
word
unfair.
i'm
sorry.
i...
i
believe
that
truth
in
lending
is
about
disclosure
as
to
whether
or
not
they
have
to--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
don't
believe
so
because
when
it
is
charged
as
a
flat
fee
as
an
other
charge,
besides
the
fact
that
there's
interest
charged
on
top
of
it,
the
consumer
is
in
a
position
that
they
then
need
to
compare
cost
of
credit,
one,
as
a
dollar
figure,
the
other
as
an
apr.
and
while
i
believe
ms.
mcdowell
said
that
the
primary
purpose
of
tila
is
to
create
bright
line
rules
for
the
credit
card
industry,
i
think
there
is
significant
support,
as
this
court
has
stated,
that
one
of
the
primary
objectives
is
making
sure
the
consumer
can
understand
the
cost
of
credit.
and...
and
congress
has
said
we--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--because
congress
said
we
want
that
to
be
an
apples-to-apples
comparison.
so
ms.
pfennig
can
know
that
the
extensions
of
credit
she
received
up
till
now
were
charged
at
18.49
percent.
she
knows
that
the
extension
of
credit
she
received
over
her
credit
limit
was
$29--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--the
simple
answer
is
i
don't
know.
ultimately
i
think
the
federal
reserve
board
does
have
to
offer
the
direction
of
how
this
will
be
disclosed,
but
i
think
the
important
thing...
and
i
believe--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--but
i
don't
believe
that
that's
necessarily
how
it
would
be
done.
i
believe
that,
justice
breyer,
you
had
said
earlier
about
how
certain...
there
are
instances
where
certain
fees
are
disclosed
differently.
you
can
have
a
situation
where
a
cash
advance
is
calculated
at
a
different
apr
than
the
contract
rate
of
the
finance
charge.
an
atm
fee
might
be
charged
at
a
different...
a
different
apr
than
something
else.
and
those
are
itemized
at
the
bottom.
you
wouldn't
necessarily
not
let
them
know
that
this
was
a
charge
incident
to
something
over
the
credit
limit,
but
you
would
put
it
in
apples-to-apples
comparison,
which
i
believe--
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
--i
think
that
ultimately
depends
on...
on
the
construction
of
the
regulation.
we...
we
seem
to
want
to
parse
out
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit
without
looking
at
the
context
of
the
regulation
that
these
are
acts
of
default.
and
what
we
have
alleged
in
the
complaint,
which
ultimately
is
controlling
here,
is
not
an
act
of
default.
so
in
that
instance,
the
regulation
is
not
triggered
and
it's
premature
for
us
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
was
rationally
based.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
and
i
think
that
gets
back
to
justice...
justice
kennedy's
question
of
quite
some
time
ago.
where
i
was
trying
to
go
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
nature
of
a
late
fee
and
an
over-limit
fee.
and
the...
the
federal
reserve
board
went
out
of
its
way
to
create
that
factual
distinction
as
to
late
fees.
and
late
fees,
by
nature,
are
on
the
periphery
of
the
cost
of
an
extension
of
credit.
while
the
total
has
to
be
disclosed
and
your
late
payment
is
associated
with
whether
or
not
you
paid
toward
the
total,
an
over-limit
fee
by
its
nature
is
tied
to
a
specified
extension
of
credit.
may
i
have
this
extension
of
credit,
which
happens
to
take
me
over
the
credit
limit?
yes,
you
may,
but
we
are
going
to
charge
you
a
fee
for
that.
and
i
think
that's
the
distinction,
is
that
to
the
extent
we
have
to
get
to...
let's
just
assume
the
regulation
controls
here.
does
it
make
sense?
is
it
rationally
based
to
create
a
factual
distinction
as
to
late
fees
which
are
on
the
periphery
of
the
cost
of
an
extension
of
credit
and
not
do
so
for
an
over-limit
fee
that
goes
to
the
very
core
of
what
the
finance
charge
is
supposed
to
disclose?
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
to
the
extent
that
it
controls
here,
which
i'm
not
sure
it
does,
i
think
yes.
and
that...
that
decision
comes
down
the
nature
of
the
fee
and
whether
or
not
it
is
so
integrally
tied
to
the
cost
of
an
extension
of
credit
that
it
has
to
be
disclosed
as
part
of
the
finance
charge,
and
we
think
that
it
does.
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
yes.
with
all
due
respect,
i
believe
she
said...
may
i
finish
the
question?
ms.
sylvia
antalis
goldsmith
thank
you.
