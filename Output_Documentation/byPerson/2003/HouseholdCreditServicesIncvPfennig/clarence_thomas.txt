justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
respondent
holds
a
credit
card
initially
issued
by
petitioner
household
credit
services,
and
in
which
petitioner
mbna
america
bank
now
holds
an
interest.
although
the
terms
of
respondent’s
credit
card
agreement
set
her
credit
limit
at
$2,000,
respondent
was
able
to
make
charges
exceeding
that
limit
subject
to
a
$29
fee
for
each
month
in
which
her
balance
exceeded
$2,000.
petitioner
disclosed
the
$29
fee
in
respondent’s
monthly
statement
but
did
not
include
the
fee
under
the
label
“finance
charge”
because
the
federal
reserve
board
has
issued
a
regulation
called
regulation
z,
which
excludes
from
the
definition
of
finance
charge
fees
that
are
imposed
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit.
respondent
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
alleging
petitioners,
that
petitioner
violated
the
truth
in
lending
act,
tila,
by
failing
to
disclose
the
over
limit
fee
as
a
finance
charge.
the
district
court
granted
petitioner’s
motion
to
dismiss
but
a
sixth
circuit
panel
reversed.
the
term
"finance
charge"
is
used
in
15
u.s.c.
section
1605(a)
as
an
amount
“payable
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
person
to
whom
the
credit
is
extended
and
imposed
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
creditor
as
an
incident
to
the
extension
of
credit.”
because
respondent
alleged
in
her
complaint
that
petitioners
allowed
her
to
make
charges
that
exceeded
her
credit
limit
and
the
over
limit
charge
was
charged
as
condition
of
this
additional
extension
of
credit,
the
sixth
circuit
concluded
that
the
over
limit
fee
in
this
case
fell
clearly
and
unmistakably
under
the
definition
of
a
finance
charge
and
hence,
that
regulation
z’s
interpretation
of
the
definition
was
unreasonable.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
case
presents
two
questions.
we
first
ask
whether
section
1605(a)'s
definition
of
finance
charge
clearly
covers
over
limit
fees.
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
that
is
the
end
of
the
battle.
if,
however,
1605(a)’s
definition
of
finance
charge
is
ambiguous
with
respect
to
over
limit
fees,
we
then
ask
only
whether
regulation
z
is
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
manifestly
contrary
to
the
statute.
as
to
the
first
question,
we
find
that
section
1605(a)
does
not
unambiguously
cover
over
limit
fees.
the
phrase
incident
to
the
extension
of
credit
implies
some
necessary
connection
between
the
antecedent
and
its
object,
but
it
does
not
make
clear
whether
a
substantial
as
opposed
to
remote
connection
is
required.
in
another
tila
provision,
over
limit
fees
are
defined
as
fees
imposed
“in
connection
with
an
extension
of
credit
rather
than
incident
to
an
extension
of
credit.”
thus,
the
best
reading
of
section
1605(a)
might
be
that
over
limit
fees
are
excluded
from
the
definition
of
finance
charge.
at
the
very
least,
section
1605(a)
is
ambiguous
regarding
this
point.
our
only
remaining
question
then
is
whether
the
board’s
interpretation
of
section
1605(a)
is
procedurally
defective,
arbitrary,
or
capricious
in
substance,
or
manifestly
contrary
to
the
statute.
regulation
z
is
none
of
these
things.
the
board
adapted
regulation
z
in
order
to
emphasize
disclosures
that
are
most
relevant
to
credit
decisions,
because
the
imposition
of
an
over
limit
fee
occurs
only
when
a
consumer
violates
the
credit
agreement.
the
board
reasonably
concluded
that
over
limit
fees
are
less
relevant
to
determining
the
true
cost
of
credit
and
therefore
that
these
fees
should
be
excluded
from
what
is
labeled
the
finance
charge.
regulation
z
is
consistent
with
the
terms
of
section
1605(a)
and
with
tila's
purpose
of
promoting
meaningful
disclosure
to
consumers.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
