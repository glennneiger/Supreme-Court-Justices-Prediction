mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
regulation
promulgated
by
the
federal
reserve
board
to
govern
the
disclosure
of
fees
imposed
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit.
it
does
not
involve
any
challenge
to
the
fees
themselves
or
any
contention
that
the
fees
were
not
disclosed.
unquestionably
they
were.
this
case
concerns
only
how
such
fees
should
be
characterized
when
they
are
disclosed.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
explained
in
his
brief
for
the
federal
reserve
board,
ordinarily
the
arrangement
between
banks...
that
is,
the
banks
that
issue
the
cards
and
the
banks
that
do
the
corresponding
relationship
with
the
merchants...
have
an
agreement
between
the
merchants
and
the
banks
where
the
merchant
will
be
liable
for
fraudulent
use
of
the
card
or
the
other
unless
it
obtains
authorization
to
process
the
charge.
and
so
in
the
ordinary
practice,
the
board
has
explained,
a
merchant
may
or
may
not,
is
not
required
to,
but
may
well
call
in
the
charge
or
submit
the
account
number
to
the
issuing
bank
via
the
correspondent
bank
and
get
an
approval,
yes
or
no,
to
process
the
charge.
now,
the
board
has
explained
that
when
the
issuing
bank
authorizes
the
merchant
to
process
the
charge,
that
two
important
things
don't
happen.
one,
it
does
not
in
any
way
represent
a
renegotiation
between
the
consumer
and
the
issuing
bank,
and
it
says
nothing
about
the
overall
credit
limit.
and
two,
the
issuing
bank
often
will
have
no
idea
whether
the
charge
being
authorized
will
or
will
not
trigger
a
credit
limit
of
the
consumer
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
not
the
least
of
which
is
that,
as
the
board
explains,
credits
and
payments
aren't
instantly
reflected,
merchants
often
don't
put
the
true
amount
of
the
charge
in.
they
may,
as
hotels
and...
and
rental
car
companies
do...
often
block
very
large
amounts
because
they
don't
know
what
the
ultimate
charge
will
be.
and
there
is
also
a
recognition
in
the
industry,
the
board
explains,
of
a
certain
tolerance.
that
is,
the
merchant...
the
credit
card
company
won't
always
want
to
cut
somebody
off
whenever
it
has
a
suspicion
that
they
may
have
hit
their
credit
limit
because
the
merchant
has
a
relationship
with
the
customer.
and
since
the
system
of
information
is
so
imperfect,
the
issuing
bank
also
has
a
relationship
with
its
consumer
and
doesn't
want
to
embarrass
the
consumer.
so
the
short
answer
to
that...
the
short
version
of
the
very
long
answer
is
in
the
ordinary
course,
merchants
have
an
incentive
to
seek
authorization,
but
they're
not
required
to,
and
the
authorization
that's
given
doesn't
reflect
knowledge
by
the
issuer
that
a
credit
limit
will
be
exceeded.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
creditor...
the
consumer
may
or
may
not
know
that
his
or
her
credit
limit
was
exceeded,
but
of
course,
that
information
is
entirely
within
the
knowledge
of
the...
the
potential
knowledge
of
the
consumer
because
the
consumer
does
know
what
or...
what
charges
he
or
she
has
made
and
what
payments
he
or
she
has
made.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
possible
either
because
he
doesn't
keep
good
track
or
he
doesn't...
he's
not
accurate
or
he's
allowed
a
child
or
a
spouse
to
use
the
card
and
isn't
keeping
track
or
control
of
that.
but
one
thing
that
you
said,
your
honor,
that
is
not
true
is
the
issuing...
the
credit
card
issuer
is
not
giving
permission
directly
to
the
consumer
to
do
anything,
and
most
particularly
if--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
merchant--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
merchant
won't
know.
the
merchant
isn't
going
to
tell
the
customer
anything.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
the
credit
card
issuer
may
not
know.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
you're
positing--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
is
a
credit...
there
is
an
agreement
that
must
be
accepted--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you're--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
are
correct
that
it
is
possible
that
the
consumer
won't
realize
it
and
the
issuer
may
know.
and
in
that
instance,
the
issuer,
which
has
no
relationship
directly
with
the
consumer,
doesn't
tell
the
merchant
to
tell
the
consumer.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but,
justice
stevens--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
only
partially
correct.
it's
correct
factually
given
the
hypothetical
that
you've
articulated.
it's
incorrect
legally
because
the
credit
agreement...
it
must--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is
true
with
the
following
caveats.
i'm
not
trying
to
fight
the
hypothetical.
i
just
want
to
make
sure--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
i
can't,
and
here's
why,
justice
stevens.
i...
i
mean
no
disrespect.
but
many,
many
credit
card
issuers
do
not
imply
an
over-limit
fee
on
a
transactional
basis.
they
apply
it,
for
example,
if
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
balance
exceeds
the
limit
as
opposed
to
whether
a
particular
transaction
sort
of
spikes
it
over
the
limit
one
time.
and
so
i'm
just
trying
to
be
completely
accurate.
now,
the
term...
i
think
it's
very
important--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
that
must...
there
must
be
instances
in
which
that
is
true.
but
the
term,
credit
limit,
your
honor,
is
a
term
of
art
that
is
recognized
in
the
industry,
that
is
reflected
in
the
federal
reserve
board
regulations,
and
it
draws
an
important
distinction
between
increasing
a
credit
limit,
an
established
credit
limit,
upon
an
application
and
authorizing
a
point-of-sale
transaction.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
merchant
has
a
safe
harbor,
your
honor.
the
merchant
is
told,
if
you
pay
this
charge
and
it
turns
out
not
to
be
collectible
for
any
reason,
we
will
hold
you
harmless.
and
that's
the
reason
that
this
business...
contractual
relationship
is
established
between
issuers
and
merchants,
as
a
way
to
encourage
merchants
to
allow
use
of
the
card.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
my
understanding,
justice
souter,
is
it
varies
depending
on
issuer
and
card,
but
that
is,
some...
some
cards
will...
all...
all...
well,
there
are
some
credit
cards
and
charge
cards
that
don't
have
limits,
but
when
they
have
a
limit,
the
limit
is
required
to
be
explicated
in
the
initial
disclosures.
and
in
the
solicitation,
the
disclosure,
and
all
periodic
statements,
the
lender,
the
credit
card
issuer,
is
required
to
identify
the
credit
limit
and
specify
that
fees
that
are
charged
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit
will
be
the
following
amount.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
don't...
i
will
explain
what
difference
it
makes.
no
one
has
yet
explained,
neither
the
respondent
in
this
case
nor
the
sixth
circuit,
how
the
consumer
is
benefitted
by
the
rule
that
she's
advocating
or
the
sixth
circuit's
rule,
but
here's
how
it
works.
in
the
open-end
credit
relationship,
the
credit
card
or
charge
card
relationship,
there
are
three
relevant
events.
one
is
the
solicitation
or
advertisement
to
invite
someone
to
enter
into
a
relationship.
that's
called
the
solicitation.
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--for
a
purchase
of
a
credit
card.
you
get
a
letter
in
the
mail
saying
buy
a...
open
a
citibank
card,
and
there
are
certain
disclosures
that
are
required
in
those
solicitations.
if
you
send
back
something
that
says,
yes,
i
want
to
have
a...
i
want
one
of
your
credit
cards,
the
act
and
the
regulations
require
that
certain
disclosures
be
made
at
that
point,
and
that's
called
the
initial
disclosure.
and
then
the
third
event
is
the
periodic
statement,
when
you
get
your
statement
every
month
or
so.
now,
with
respect
to
the
solicitation
and
the
initial
disclosure,
the
consequences
of
calling
this
a
finance
charge
or
a
component
of
the
finance
charge
versus
an
other
charge
are
zero.
that
is,
in
both
of
those
instances,
the
lender,
the
issuer,
must
disclose
that
there
will
be
charges
paid...
fees
assessed
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit
and
how
much
it
is.
and
they're
not
characterized
there
as
part
of
the
finance
charge
or
otherwise.
the...
on
the...
those
documents
require
a
statement
of
what
the
apr,
the
annualized
percentage
rate,
is,
but
the
apr
in
those
statements
refers
only
to
the
periodic
rate,
the
interest
rate
that's
going
to
be
charged
to
all...
applied
to
all
charges.
in
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
because
you
don't
know
whether
there
will
be
late
charges
or
over-limit
charges.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
not
at
those
two
stages,
but
at
the
third
stage,
that
is,
the
periodic
statement,
when
you
get
your
bill
every
month,
there
is
a
difference
there.
in
both
instances,
there
will
be
a
specification
of
over-limit
charge,
but
if
the
sixth
circuit
is
right,
in
those
instances
in
which
the
issuer
actually
knew
that
the
charge
it
authorized
the
merchant
to
process
resulted
in
the
consequence
of
an
over-limit
charge,
it
would
be
called
over-limit
charge
finance
charge.
that
is,
there
would
be
a
line
item
that
specifies
what
it
is,
just
like
any
other
charge
or
any
other
purchase
or
payment,
and
the
amount.
but
it
would
affect
the
annual
percentage
rate,
what's
called
the
historical
annual
percentage
rate,
in
the
periodic
statement.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
there...
yes,
there
are,
justice
stevens,
because
there
are
certain
types
of
charges
that
may
or
may
not
occur.
for
example,
if
you
use
your
card
to
get
cash
at
the
cash
machine
or
something
that
will
be...
will...
that
are
charged
in
the
finance...
that
are
part
of
the
finance
charge
and
will,
therefore,
affect
the
apr
on
the
monthly
statement,
but
won't
be
disclosed
to
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
her...
i'm
not
saying
that
her
theory
or
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
couldn't
work.
it
would
require
a
great
deal
of
additional
rulemaking
by
the
federal
reserve
board
because
the
apr
is
a...
is
a
fraction,
is
a
percentage,
the
numerator
of
which
is
the
component
of
all
the
individual
charges
and
the
denominator
is
something
that,
in
the
context
of
an
over-limit
fee,
is
unclear.
does
it
apply
to
the
transaction
that
it
was
applied
to?
is
it
the
average
monthly
balance?
is
it
for
the
whole
month
or
part
of
the
month?
it's
not
impossible.
but
what
it...
what
it
is
is
directly
contrary
to
the
two
objectives
of
tila.
the
purpose
of
tila
is
to
come
up
with
bright
line
classifications
that
are
readily
complied
with
by
issuers
and
that
help
consumers
compare
competing
costs
of
credit.
that
is
manifest
in
congress'
purpose,
and
a
rule
that
requires
the
treatment
month
to
month,
charge
to
charge
depend
on
what
the
issuer
knew
at
the
time
it
authorized
some
charge
that
may
later
be
determined
to
have
triggered
at...
the...
allowing
the
borrower
to
exceed
the
credit
limit
would
cause
these
monthly
apr's
to
vary
widely
and,
it
seems
to
me,
can
only
create
confusion
and
inability
to
say,
well,
gee,
i
just
got
an
application
or
a...
a
thing
in
the
mail
from,
you
know,
citibank
saying
17.3
percent,
but
i
just
looked
at
my
statement
and
it's
79
percent.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
yes,
in
the
month
in
which
it
has
occurred
because,
with
respect
to
the
next
month,
whatever
finance
charge
was
applied
and...
and
continues
as
a
balance
will
also
have
applied
to
it
the
finance
charge,
that
is,
the
interest
rate
that
would
apply.
so,
but
with...
there
is
a
consequence
in
the
month
in
which
it
is
applied;
that
is,
for
whatever
days
it's
outstanding,
up
until
the...
the
end
of
the...
the
card's
grace
period,
a
finance
charge
could
be
applied
to
that
other
charge.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
these
cards
typically
have
a
grace
period
in
which
you
can
pay
off
your
balance
and
you
don't
have
to
pay
any
finance
charge,
but
if
you
don't,
whatever
charges
are
carried
forward,
whether
they
derive
from
purchases
or
over-limit
charges
or
late
fee
charges
or...
or
finance
charges
in
the
previous
month,
something
is
charged
against
it.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
disclosed
this
fee
properly
within
the
regulation
was
passed
on
by
the
lower
court.
it
is
the
law
of
the
case.
the
lower
court
held,
as
the
second
part
of
its
ruling,
that,
quote,
unequivocally
the
regulation
required
us
to
disclose
this
fee
as
an
other
charge.
now,
justice
scalia
is
correct
that
how
you
interpret
the
fed's
bright
line
regulation
which
says,
at
page
2
of
our
blue
brief,
the
following
charges
are
not
finance
charges.
charges
for
exceeding
a
credit
limit,
of
course,
depends
on
what
credit
limit
means,
and
credit
limit
is
a
term
of
art.
everybody
in
the
industry
understands
it.
even
the
respondent
at
page
1
of
her
brief,
she
says,
quote,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
a
credit
limit
represents
the
amount
of
credit
the
card
issuer
has
preapproved
the
consumer
to
obtain.
there's
no
possible
allegation
in
this
case
that
she
ever
asked
for
an
extension
of
her
credit
limit
or
received
an
extension
of
her
credit
limit.
and
there
is
a
reason
that
the
board
came
up
with
an
absolute
bright
line
rule,
and
the
reason
is
that
before
1980,
when
congress
mandated
classifications
in
order
to
simplify
things
for
creditors
and
consumers,
the
federal
reserve
board
confronted...
confronted
questions
like
many
of
the
hypotheticals
that
justice
stevens
and
others
have
asked
here.
well,
what
if...
what
if
they
knew
that
it
was
going
to
exceed
it
and
what
if
somebody
actually
called
and
asked
permission.
i
don't
want
to
be
embarrassed
in
the
store.
will
you
authorize
this?
the
board
literally...
and
some
of...
many
of
these
letter
interpretations
are
cited
in
the
briefs
in
this
case,
although
not
all
of
them.
the
board
drove
itself
crazy
trying
to
answer
all
of
these
hypotheticals
and
came
up
with
a
set
of
letter
rulings,
exacerbated
by
the
federal
courts
also
trying
to
come
up
with
their
own
interpretations,
that
made
it
impossible
for
issuers
to
come
up
with
formulaic
disclosures
that
would
prevent
them
from
being
socked
with
huge
class
action
awards
and
allowed
them
to
present
information
that
consumers
could
compare.
and
so
congress
said
in
1980
we
want
bright
line
classifications,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
board
did.
in
1980,
the
board
said
that
it
was
amending
its
regulations
to,
quote,
substitute
where
possible
precise,
easily
applied
rules
for
principles
that
create
ambiguity
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--thank
you,
your
honor.
