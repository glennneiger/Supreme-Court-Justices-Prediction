mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ramirez
home
was
searched
pursuant
to
a
nonsensical
warrant.
they
were
deprived
of
the
protections
of
the
essential
function
of
the
warrant,
which
this
court
has
said
is
to
assure
the
individual
whose
property
is
being
searched
and
seized
of
the
lawful
authority
of
the
executing
officer,
his
need
to
search,
and
the
limits
of
his
power
to
search.
the
particularity
requirement
has--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--yes,
your
honor,
you
say
that
in...
it
was
actually
quoted
in
the
mcgrew
case.
it
was
stated
in
illinois
v.
gates
and
in
citing
chadwick
at
page
9
in
california
v.
acevedo.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
with...
with
respect
to
a
wiretap,
you
have
some
exigent
circumstances
there.
what
the...
what
the
ramirezes
were
facing
were
the
search
of
their
home--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--there's
no
necessarily...
there's...
with
a
wiretap
there's
no
invasion,
a
physical
invasion
of
the
home
and
the
rummaging
through
their
personal
belongings.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
that's
true,
your--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--your...
your
honor,
that...
that
is
correct.
the...
the
warrant
was...
was
facially
invalid,
it
was
plain
to
see,
but
the...
the
ninth
circuit
has
established
a
very...
clearly
established
rules
to
say
that
the
warrant
required
a
particular
description.
we
are
willing
to...
if
it's
not
contained
within
the
four
corners
of
that
document...
to
go
be...
to
look
at
documents
outside
the
four
corners,
provided
it
meets
certain
criteria,
that
being
it
is
specifically
referenced
into
the...
into...
in
the
warrant
itself
and
somehow
accompanies
or
is
attached
to
the
warrant.
under
those
circumstances
it
would
become
part
of
the
warrant
and
they
would
recognize
that,
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
that
has...
was
the
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit
for
a
long
period
of
time.
agent
groh
should
have
known
about
that,
and
it
was...
it
was
the
clear
law
and
therefore
a
constitutional
violation
took
place
and
he
did
not...
could
not
have
good
faith
in
his
belief
that
he
complied
with
that
requirement
of
the
warrant.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
your
honor,
mcgrew
was
decided
6
months
after
the
search
in
this
case.
however,
the
events
that
took
place
in
mcgrew
happened
before
this
case.
if
mcgrew
had
never
occurred,
this
would
have
been--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--the...
the
mcgrew
decision
said
that
it
was
clearly
established
at...
through
their...
their
prior
decisions
of
the
requirement
that
the
warrant
refer
to
and
either
have
attached
to
or
accompany
the
affidavit
if
you
wanted
to...
to
use
it
as
a
basis
to
meet
the
particularity
requirement,
and
it...
it
looked
at
other
cases
besides
just
that
one.
this
has
been
the
law
in
this
circuit
for
over...
over
a
decade.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
because
it's
a...
not
to
have
that
warrant
or
the
supporting
documentation
to
the
warrant
present
to
meet
the
particularity
requirement
is
an
opportunity
for
abuse.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
to
be
abuse
to...
to
the...
that
the
officer
can
come
to
the
home,
say
i'm
planning...
i'm
planning
to
search
for...
for
something,
ransack
the
house,
find
nothing,
leave
no
warrant,
and
the
person
has
no
idea
of
the
legal
authority
of...
of
why
the
officer
was
there,
what
he
was
doing
there.
he
could
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
he
wants
to
go
in
and
rummage
through
the
personal
papers
and--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
bivens
19...
in
1983
action,
depending
upon
whether
the
actor
is
state
or
federal
agent,
follow
the
same...
same
line
of
reasoning
of
whether...
was
the
action
a
violation
of
constitutional
right
and
was
it
objectively
reasonable.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
the...
the...
the
damages
was
to...
to
the...
the
homeowner's
ability
to
be
assured
of
the
authority
of
the
officer
to
be
here.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
was
no
opportunity
ever
for
the...
the
homeowner
to...
to
know
what--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--well,
you're--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--yes,
your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
and,
in
fact,
in
the
gant
case,
which
was
cited
in...
in
mcgrew,
they
said
that
there's
a...
a
duty
of
the
officer
under
the
rule
to
provide
the
homeowner
with
the
warrant
prior
to
leaving
the
scene.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
no.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
the...
the
gant
decision
that
referred
to
the...
to
the
rule
was
looking
at
the...
the
argument
was
made
in
that
case
by
the
government
that
the
rule
only
required
it,
and
said
that
since
the...
the
katz
decision
says
that
it...
the
rule
does
not
invariably
require
it
to...
the
government
to
serve
the
warrant,
that
it
must
usually
require
that
it
be
done.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
the...
the
real
problem
in
this...
in
this
case,
when
if...
if
there
is
no
duty
to
leave
a
warrant,
as
suggested
by
the...
the
united
states
in
their...
their
brief
when
no
property
is
taken,
then
it's
the
invitation
to
abuse
that
i...
i
talked
about
earlier.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
no.
i
think
the
plain
language
of
the
particularity
requirement
is
all
that
is
needed
and
this
does
not
meet
the
particularity
requirement.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
the
damage
is
the
fact
that
their
constitutional
right
to
have
a...
a
properly
executed
and
a
properly
written
warrant
prior
to
the
invasion
of
the
home.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
correct.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
because
there
was
no
effort
on
the
part
of
agent
groh
to
comply
with
that
particular
requirement,
and
that
leads
to
the
opportunity
for
abuse
because
he...
there
is
no
evidence
in
the...
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
had
any...
did
anything
to
comply...
to
see
that
he
had
a
warrant
that
met
the
particularity
requirement.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
it
does
not
require
a
warrant
all
the
time
if
there
are
exigent
circumstances.
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
in
this
case.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
because
i
think
the...
that
would
trivialize
the...
the
requirement
of
the
particularity
clause,
because
particularity
as
well
as
probable
cause
weigh
into
the...
the
general
warrant
situation
and--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--that...
that's
correct,
and
he...
he
should
have
done
that,
because
the...
the
problem
here
is
that
there
was...
it
was
plain
for
everyone
to
see.
this
was
the...
the
leon...
the
warrant
that
was
envisioned
in
leon
that
was
so
facially
valid
that
no
reasonable
officer
could
rely
on
it--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--only
if
there
is
good
faith
that
the
officer
attempted
to
comply
with
the
particularity
requirement,
because
if
there
was
good
faith
that
there
was
probable
cause,
that
does
not
supply
the
particularity
any
more
than
the
oath
and
affirmation
to
say
that
this
was
oath
and
affirmation.
to
have
a
valid
warrant
you
need
all
legs
of
the
stool,
and
the
particularity
requirement
is
one
of
those.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
we're
seeking
money
damages
that
a...
a
jury
would--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--it...
it
would
depend,
your
honor,
on--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--we
didn't
put...
specify
a
dollar
amount
in
the
complaint.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
yes,
it
is...
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
because
the
trauma...
the
traumatization
that
mrs.
ramirez
went
through
by
agents
coming
into
her
home
and
saying,
we
have
a
warrant
to
search
for
explosives--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--yes,
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
that...
that's
correct--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--because
there
was
that
time
frame,
and
in
this
case
it
was
a
continue
of
a
time
frame
that
she
was
under...
under
the
fright
of
people
being
in
her
home,
searching
it,
ransacking
it,
going...
going
through
it.
there
was...
we've
alleged
in
the
complaint
damage
to
personal
property.
all
this
was
done
without
her
knowing
and
whether
they
had
the
right
to
be
there,
what
they
were
looking
for
other
than--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--that
would
be
an
oral
notification,
and
there
is
no
assurance
given
to
the...
through
oral
notification,
he
could
make
up
anything
he
wants.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
well,
that
makes
an
assumption
of
what
took
place
there.
in
today's
society
most
people
can
read
and
mrs.
ramirez
can--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--if
the...
the--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
no.
there's...
there's...
that
hasn't
even
come
up.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
yes,
they
did
go
to
search
the
entire
ranch.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
and
they
did
look
in
various
other
buildings.
there
was
a
statement
in
the
affidavits...
in
the
complaint,
which
has
not
been
denied
that
they...
in
some
ways
secured...
they...
there
was
admissions
in...
in
answers--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--yes,
that's--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--that's
correct.
but
if
you
were
to...
if
you
were
to
read
it
that
it
was
the...
to
search
the
ranch
for
the
blue
house,
then--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--no.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
that's
the
position
that
we've
taken
all
along.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
we...
we
haven't
thought
about
damages
in...
in
your...
since
the...
the
motion
to
dismiss
was...
was
granted
and
we've
been
arguing
the...
the
points
of
law.
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
yes,
that's
correct.
there
were...
there
were
damages--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
--that's...
that
damage
would
have
been
the...
been
the
same.
the...
the
damage
to
them
is
the
fact
that
the
search
was
done
and
there
was
no...
since
the
search
was
under
a
illegal
warrant,
we
contend
that
the
search
was
illegal
and
any
damages
coming
through
from
the
legal
search
are
compensable,
but
that's
to
be
decided
down...
down
the
road.
the...
the
marks
v.
clarke
case
that
was
referred
to
earlier
about...
saying
that
there
was
no
duty
to
read
the
warrant
by
the
officers
is
not
entirely
correct.
in
the...
in
the
marks
case,
in
the...
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
there
was
no
duty
for
the
officers
executing
the
warrant
to
read
it,
as
long
as
they
be...
they
fulfilled
their
duty
to
become
familiar
with
it
before
they
went
out
there.
however,
the...
the
court
did
say
that
the
officers
who
applied
for
the
warrant
had
a
duty
to
make
sure
that
they
had
the
valid
warrant.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
vincent
j.
kozakiewicz
that
is
a
debatable
question.
i
think
that
the
better
approach
would
have
been
to
stop
at
that
moment
and
seek
clarification
from
the
court
since
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances.
but
here,
the
officer
had
not
noticed
the
error,
the
magistrate
had
not
noticed
the
error,
no
one
on
the
team
had
noticed
the
error.
the
next
day,
a
lawyer
sitting
in
his
office
reading
the
page
in
the
cold
light
of
day
noticed
the
error.
immediately
agent
groh
responded,
faxed
him
the
face
page
of
the
application.
his
conduct
here
was
clearly
in
good
faith
and...
and
to
impose
qualified
immunity
would
be
wrong
and
would
be
in
total
violation
of
this
court's
cases
and
clearly
established
law.
