mr.
austin
c.
schlick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
rejected
a
technical
perfection
standard
in
construing
a
warrant.
in
steele
v.
united
states,
the
warrant
authorized
a
search
of
611
west
46th
street.
this
court
determined,
in
light
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
including
the
affidavit
that
was
submitted
to
the
magistrate
in
that
case,
that
the
search
properly
was
conducted
for
609
west
46th
street,
as
well
as
611,
and
the
rules...
the
rules
stated
in
steele
v.
united
states
is
that
a
warrant
satisfies
the
particularity
requirement
of
the
warrant
clause
if
an
officer
executing
a
search
could
determine
with
reasonable
effort
what
the
magistrate
authorized.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
and
it...
the
question
in
that
case,
your
honor,
would
be,
is
it
clear
what
the
magistrate
authorized?
in
this
case--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--in...
in
that
case,
if
it
is
not
clear,
then
there
is
a
violation
of
the
particularity
requirement--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--no,
it's...
it...
is...
in
fact
it
was
unsealed,
and
typically
when
warrants
are
put...
when
applications
are
placed
under
seal,
there's
a
provision
for
unsealing
the
application
upon
the
indictment
or
after
a
period
of
time,
or
a
motion
to
unseal
can
be
brought,
which
could
have
been
done
in
this
case,
but
in
fact,
the
motion
was
brought
by
the
government
in
the...
in
the
first
place.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect,
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit's
belief,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
the...
a
supposed
interest
in
reviewing
the
warrant
during
the
search.
as
mr.
cordray
explained,
that's
inconsistent
with
rule
41.
it
also
would
render
impossible
electronic
surveillance.
the...
there
also
would
be
a
serious
safety
concern.
we
simply
do
not
want
citizens
contesting
at
the
scene
of
the
search
whether
the
scope...
whether
the
scope
of
the
search
is
lawful.
it
is
safer
for
everyone--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--under
rule
41,
the
right
attaches
when
property
is
seized,
as
part
of
the
receipt
for
the
property
that's
seized.
there
may,
as
with--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--no,
again
that
would
be
analyzed
under
the
law
of
knock
and
announce,
and
it
may
be
reasonable
under
the
circumstances--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--and
the
question
would
be--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--if...
if
the
homeowner
denied
entry
until
a
copy
of
the
warrant
is
provided,
the
officer
would
be
faced
with
the
question,
is
this
a
constructive
denial
of
entry?
is
there
some
exigency
for
getting
into
the
property?
and
it
may
be
reasonable
under
the
circumstances--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--if
there
were
no
exigencies,
then
ordinarily
the
reasonableness
principle
probably
would
require
that,
but
the
purpose
of
the
particularity
requirement,
it's
very
clear,
is
to
ensure
that
the
search
is
conducted
in
accordance
with
what
the
magistrate
authorized.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
we...
we
are
not
conceding
it's
a
constitutional
requirement.
we're
saying
that
under
certain
circumstances--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--under...
under
circumstances
where
there
is
no
exigency
where
the
request
to
see
the
warrant--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--if...
if
the
choice...
if
the
homeowner
denies
entry,
there's
no
exigency,
and
the
officer's
faced
with
the
choice
of
break
down
the
door
or
show
the
warrant,
then
reasonableness
may
require
showing
the
warrant.
but...
but
no,
there
is
no
general...
there
is
no
general
reasonableness
requirement,
and
as
i've
said,
this
court's
cases,
cases
such
as
dalia
and
electronic
surveillance
contexts
make
clear--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--our
position,
your
honor,
is
there
is
no
general
requirement
of
providing
a
copy
of
the
warrant,
and
the
ninth
circuit
asserted
an
interest
in
reviewing
the
warrant
during
the
search
is
simply
not
protected
by
the
particularity
requirement--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--it...
it
may
under
circumstances,
but
not
as
a
general
rule.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
i...
i
think
it...
it...
in
most
circumstances
would
be
reasonable,
yes,
that
the--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--the...
the
question...
the
question
in
that
case
would
be
whether
the
search
was
conducted
within
the
scope
of
the
warrant.
if
so,
it
would
be
a
valid
search
and--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--a...
a
search
would
not
be
rendered
unreasonable
by
virtue
of
a
discussion
between
the
officers
and
the
citizen.
the
question
would
be
how
the
search
was
conducted.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
law--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--that...
that's
true
and,
of
course,
the
things
that
are
seized
may
not
conform
to
the
warrant
because
of
the
plain
view
rule
that
the
officer
may
seize
things
that
aren't
covered
in
the
rest
of
the
warrant.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
now,
under
the
law
of
qualified
immunity--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--the
only
requirement
to
providing
the
warrant
is
if
property
is
taken
away.
agent
groh
also
is
protected
from
suit
under
the
law
of
qualified
immunity.
there
was...
there's
no
clearly
established
law
that
requires
an
officer
to
undertake
particular
procedures
in
the
preparation
of
a
warrant.
the
ninth's
circuit
novel
proofreading
requirement
had
not
even
been
conceived
at
the
time
of
this
search.
in
addition,
the
law
is
in
disarray
concerning
the
circumstances
under
which
an
affidavit
or
an
application
may
be
considered
in
construing
the
warrant.
off...
agent
groh
also
was
operating
under
a
reasonable
mistake
of
fact.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
under
steele,
the
question
would
be
whether
it
was
sufficiently
clear
what
the
magistrate
authorized.
we
believe
under
these
circumstances
it
was
clear,
so
he
would
not
have
had
that
obligation.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
and
this
is
very
important,
officers
are
not
going
to
conduct
searches
when
there
is
a
question
about
the
scope--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--if
it's
sufficiently
clear
under
steele,
yes.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
yes.
and...
and
if...
and
again,
this
goes
to
the
purpose
of
the
particularity
requirement,
which
is
ensuring
that
the
search
is
conducted
in
accordance
with
what
the
magistrate
authorized.
if
that
is...
if
that
is
satisfied,
then
there
is
no
constitute...
then
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
and
there's
no
constitutional
interest
in
having
the
officer
delay
the
search.
but
again,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
officer
is
going
to
want
to
be
sure
that
suppression
remedy--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--yes.
the--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--again,
that's
the
constitutional
rule,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
officers
are
not
going
to
take
risks
when
they're...
when
they
don't
face
an
exigent
circumstance--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--under
these
circumstances,
which
include
particularly
the
references
in
the
warrant,
agent
groh's
application
and
affidavit,
which
include
the
clear
lift...
list...
in
his
application
and
the
magistrate's
signature
on
the
warrant
without
making
any
edits.
this
is
not
in
the
typed
version
that
we
have,
but
if
you
look
at
the
actual
warrant
form,
which
is
document
number
five
in
the
district
court,
you
can
see
that
the...
that
the
magistrate
signed
the
warrant
form
and
it's
a
typed
form
on
which
there
are
handwritten
notes,
so...
so--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--and...
and
in
this
case,
if
agent
groh
had
glanced--
