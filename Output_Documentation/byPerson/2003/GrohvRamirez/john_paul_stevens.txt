justice
john
paul
stevens
petitioner
is
a
special
agent
for
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms.
in
february
of
1997,
a
concerned
citizen
informed
petitioner
that
he
had
seen
a
stockpile
of
weaponry
including
an
automatic
riffle,
grenades,
and
a
grenade
launcher
on
a
visit
to
respondent’s
ranch
in
montana.
based
on
that
information,
petitioner
prepared
and
signed
an
application
for
a
warrant
to
search
the
ranch.
the
application
stated
that
the
search
was
for
specified
weapons,
explosives,
and
receipts
and
was
accompanied
with
detailed
affidavit
which
petitioner
also
prepared
and
executed.
petitioner
took
the
application
and
affidavit
to
a
magistrate
along
with
a
warrant
form
that
petitioner
had
also
prepared.
the
magistrate
signed
the
warrant
for
him
and
authorized
the
search.
the
warrant
form
that
petitioner
had
prepared
did
not
identify
any
of
the
items
that
he
intended
to
seize.
in
the
portion
of
the
form
that
called
for
a
description
of
these
items,
petitioner
typed
the
description
of
respondent’s
two-story
blue
house,
instead
of
describing
the
alleged
stockpile
of
firearms.
nor
did
the
warrant
incorporate
by
reference
the
itemized
list
contained
in
the
application.
the
next
day,
petitioner
led
a
team
of
law
enforcement
officers
in
executing
the
search
warrant.
but
the
search
found
no
illegal
weapons
or
explosives.
when
the
officers
left
the
ranch
petitioner
gave
respondents
a
copy
of
the
warrant,
but
not
a
copy
of
the
application
which
had
been
sealed.
respondent
sued
petitioner
and
the
other
officers
claiming,
among
other
things,
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
federal
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
for
all
the
defendants
finding
no
such
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
as
to
the
fourth
amendment
claim
against
petitioner,
and
the
court
held
that
the
warrant
was
invalid
and
that
petitioner
was
not
protected
by
qualified
immunity.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm.
the
warrant
was
plainly
invalid.
the
fourth
amendment,
an
mb
usually
requires
that
search
warrants
that
serch
warrants
particularly
describe
“the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
person
and
things
to
be
seized.”
the
warrant
failed
this
particularity
requirement
all
together
because
it
provided
no
description
whatsoever,
the
persons
and
things
to
be
seized.
the
fact
that
the
application
adequately
describe
the
evidence
sought
does
not
save
the
warrant
from
its
facial
invalidity.
the
constitution
requires
particularity
in
the
warrant
itself
and
fourth
amendment
interests
are
not
necessarily
vindicated
when
some
other
document
that
is
not
in
the
possession
of
the
officers,
there
is
something
about
the
objects
of
the
search,
but
the
contents
of
that
document
are
neither
known
to
the
person
whose
home
is
being
searched
nor
available
for
her
inspection.
despite
the
warrant’s
invalidity,
petitioner
argues
that
the
search
nonetheless
was
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
disagree
because
the
warrant
did
not
describe
the
items
to
be
searched
at
all.
it
was
so
obviously
deficient
that
we
must
treat
the
search
as
warrantless
within
the
meaning
of
our
case
law
and
warrantless
searches
at
the
home
are
presumptively
unreasonable.
petitioner
cannot
overcome
that
presumption
although,
the
scope
of
his
search
did
not
exceed
the
limits
set
forth
in
the
application.
unless
the
particular
items
described
in
the
affidavit
are
also
set
forth
in
the
warrant
itself,
there
can
be
no
written
assurance
that
the
magistrate
actually
found
probable
cause
to
search
for
and
to
seize
every
item
mentioned
in
the
affidavit.
moreover,
petitioner’s
omission
undermine
we
have
long
recognized
to
be
one
of
the
particularity
requirements
chief
goals,
assuring
the
individual
whose
property
is
searched
or
seized
that
the
lawful
authority
of
the
executive
officer
and
the
limits
of
his
power
to
search.
having
concluded
that
a
constitutional
violation
occurred,
we
further
hold
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
that
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
given
that
the
particularity
requirement
is
set
forth
in
the
constitution’s
text,
no
reasonable
officer
could
believe
that
a
warrant
that
totally
failed
to
comply
with
that
requirement
was
valid.
because
petitioner
was
the
person
who
prepared
the
invalid
one,
he
may
not
argue
that
he
reasonably
relied
on
the
magistrate’s
assurance
that
the
warrant
contained
an
adequate
description
of
the
things
to
be
seized.
even
a
cursory
reading
of
the
warrant
would
have
revealed
a
glaring
deficiency
that
any
reasonable
police
officer
would
have
known
was
constitutionally
failed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined
dissenting
from
our
holding
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
justice
thomas
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
from
my
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
also
from
the
qualified
immunity
holding.
justice
scalia
has
joined
all
of
that
opinion
and
the
chief
justice
has
joined
part
three
of
that
opinion.
