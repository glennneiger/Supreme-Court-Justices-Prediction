unknown
speaker
mr.
cordray,
what
does
the
constitution
provide
specifically
about
this?
unknown
speaker
with
regard
to
that
last
phrase,
why
don't
we
just
apply
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
warrant
refers
to
the
house.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
list
anything
that
they
were
searching
for.
unknown
speaker
who
prepared
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
on
its
face
it
referred
to
the
house,
not
the
items
being
looked
for.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
why
not
just
apply
the
constitutional
provision?
i
mean,
why
couldn't
the
agent
be
responsible
for
checking
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
but
the
affidavit
was
not
attached
to
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
not...
not
when
it
was
taken
to
be
executed.
unknown
speaker
it...
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
at...
at
some
point
in
this
analysis
of...
and
specifically
on
the
point
that
you're
addressing
with
justice
o'connor...
that
you
have
to
confront
the
language
in...
in
leon
in
which
the
court
said,
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case,
a
warrant
may
be
facially...
so
facially
deficient
that
it
cannot
comply
with
the
leon
rule.
i
was
reading
your...
your
brief
and
kind
of
waiting
with
suspense
for
you
to
address
this
point
and
it
only
comes
up
at
the
last
few
pages
of
the
reply
brief
and
you
say
it's
a
dictum.
i
think
you
have
answers
to
the...
to
the
point,
but
it
seems
to
me
rather
central
for
what
you're
discussing
right
here.
this
was
in
one
sense
of
the
word
facially
deficient,
no...
no
question
about
that.
unknown
speaker
and
it
might
be
that
the
sheppard
case
is
what
helps
you,
but--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
cordray--
--well,
did...
did
the
warrant
here
and
the
warrant
in
sheppard,
were
they
on
all
fours
insofar
as
a
cross-reference?
unknown
speaker
right,
almost
as
bad
as
the
mistake
here.
unknown
speaker
but
did
the
massachusetts
case
have
a
cross-reference
to
an
affidavit
even
though
the
affidavit
wasn't
appended?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
assume
that
the
cross-reference
has
to
be
capable
of
informing
of
what
is
left
out?
and
in
this
case,
number
one,
there
is
nothing
attached
to
the
warrant.
no
one
reading
the
warrant
could
possibly
figure
out
what
within
this
house
was...
was
being
searched
for.
unknown
speaker
and
once
again
i
guess
i
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
why
don't
we
apply
the...
the
fourth
amendment
the
way
it's
written,
and
it
says
that
the
warrant
shall
particularly
describe,
not
some
other
document
under
seal.
unknown
speaker
the
fourth
amendment
says
it's
the
warrant
that
is
supposed
to
particularly
describe,
not
documents
given
to
a
magistrate.
unknown
speaker
whether...
whether
the
homeowner
has
the
right
or
whether
the
point
is
to
make
sure
that
the
officers
executing
the
warrant
can
check
what's
in
front
of
them
and
find
out
how
far
to
go,
the
fact
remains
that
the
fourth
amendment
says
the
warrant
is
supposed
to
particularly
describe.
this
didn't,
it
had
no
document
appended
to
it
that
did.
unknown
speaker
it
may
refer
to
it,
but
if
it's
not
there,
nobody
can
figure
out
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
not
when
the
police
are
at
the
scene
they
can't.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
have
to
make
that
assumption
in...
in
order
to
apply
the
fourth
amendment
as
written.
it
could
perfectly
well
make
the
assumption
that
the
point
of
the
fourth
amendment
description
was
to
make
sure
that
the
officers
at
the
scene
knew
how
far
they
could
go.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
some
might
not...
some
might
not
have
been
like
the
officer
here,
like
officer
groh,
might
not
have
even
seen
the
attached
affidavit.
on
the
face
of
this,
this
does
look
like
the
hated
general
warrant.
it
says,
here's
a
house
and
there's
no
bounds
at
all,
so
it
looks
like
this
is
exactly
what
the
fourth
amendment
was
getting
at.
and
with
respect
to
sheppard,
i
had
a
question,
maybe
you
can
straighten
me
out
on
that.
sheppard
said
the
good-faith
exception
applies,
but
to
apply...
apply
an
exception,
wouldn't
you
need
to
have
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
so
that...
that
case
doesn't
answer
the
question,
was
there
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
unknown
speaker
and
why
do
you
have
to
ask
that
question?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
have
to
ask
that
question?
why
do
you
have
to
establish,
as
you
seem
to
be
trying
to
establish,
that
this
complied
with
the
fourth
amendment,
which,
if
you
read
the
fourth
amendment,
it
clearly
didn't.
but
what
we're
discussing
here
is
what
is
the
remedy
for
its
failure
to
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment,
aren't
we?
unknown
speaker
if...
if
i
disagree
with
you
that
there...
that
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
do
i
have
to
find
that
it
was
proper
as
a
remedy
for
that
violation
to
hold...
to
hold
this
agent
liable?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
you
say,
the
ninth
circuit
said
they
couldn't
inform
the
homeowner?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
it
didn't
say
that
they
couldn't
have,
but
it's...
it's...
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
homeowner
had
a
right
to
be
shown
the
warrant,
i
take
it,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
ninth--
--what
do
the
federal
rules
say
about
the...
what
the
police
or
the
officers
have
to
do
with
the
warrant
in
the
search
of
a
house?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
talk...
or
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
about
serving
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
papers?
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
the
later
documentation,
but
isn't
there
an
interest
in
letting
the
homeowner
know
that
the
man
has
authority
to
make
the
search?
unknown
speaker
so,
shouldn't...
shouldn't
he
have
to
display
it
if...
if
requested?
unknown
speaker
and
he'd
have
a
duty
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
my
question.
would
he
have
a
duty
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
go
back--
--it
doesn't
say
it
in
the
rule
at
all.
could
you
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
this
was
a
very
simple
case.
somebody
really
mucked
up
the
warrant,
okay?
they
made
a
technical
mistake.
instead
of
saying,
seize...
look
for
and
seize
some
guns,
they
said,
look
for
and
seize
a
house,
all
right?
now,
nobody
could
think
that
that
made
any
sense.
unknown
speaker
nobody.
no...
you
don't
think
it
does,
i
don't
think
it
does.
so
you
can
say
one
of
three
things:
a,
that
the
warrant
is
constitutional,
which
is
what
you're
arguing,
which
is
a
little
tough,
because
i
guess
if
we
said
this
was
constitutional,
we'd
have
to
say
a
warrant
is
constitutional.
if
it
says
seize
and
then
it
says
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you,
look
in
vault
three
of
the
kremlin,
you
know,
to
see
what
we're
supposed
to
seize.
i
mean,
that's
a
tough
route
that
you're
taking.
the
second
route
is
what
justice
scalia
suggested,
which
is
to
say,
well,
it
isn't
really
his
fault,
the
search
team
leader,
because
he
was
in
good
faith.
for
me,
that's
tough
because
i...
if
you
cast
his
eye
on
this
piece
of
paper
and
just
glanced
at
it,
he
would
have
seen
it
was
faulty.
route
three
is
to
say,
they're
right
in
their
lawsuit,
let
them
bring
it,
damages,
by
the
way,
are
going
to
be
pretty
low,
okay?
now
you
explain
to
me
why
it
should
be
route
two,
which
is
justice
scalia's
question,
rather
than
just
route
three.
unknown
speaker
now...
now
tell
me
why,
because
as
i've
made
my
point,
it
sounds
to
me
that
this
man
did
not
behave
sensibly,
because
if
he
just
looked
at
the
piece
of
paper
he
would
have
seen
in
3
seconds
it
says,
seize
the
house,
and
we're
not
out
here
to
seize
the
house,
we're
out
to
seize
some
guns.
unknown
speaker
so
it
wasn't
like
a
minor,
common
mistake--
unknown
speaker
--so
why
was
that
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
so
two
people--
--how
do
we
know
that
the
magistrate
did
look
at
the
piece
of
paper?
unknown
speaker
any
magistrate
who
looked
at
that
piece
of
paper
would
say
your
warrant...
your
warrant
application
or
the
form
you've
given
me
does
not
indicate
what
you're
searching
for,
unless
you
really
are
going
to
put
the
house
up
on
a
flatbed
truck
and
take
it
away,
which
we
know
you're
not.
it's...
it's...
the
obvious,
i
think
the
obvious
probability
is
that
the...
the
agent
did
not
read
what
his
secretary
had
typed
in
and
the
magistrate
did
not
read
what
the
agent
presented
to
him,
and
this
sometimes
happens.
i've
had
it
happen
to
me.
you
hand
the
magistrate
the
application
and
he
says,
where
do
you
want
me
to
sign?
isn't
that
probably
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
maybe
he
should
be
liable
too.
i
mean,
except
for
judicial
absolute
immunity,
i...
i
don't
know,
you
say,
you
know,
the
magistrate's
just
as
bad.
what
does
that
prove?
it
doesn't
prove
anything.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do
that,
just
one
preliminary
question.
justice
scalia
suggested
earlier
you
could
go
right
to
qualified
immunity
to
get
all
the
rest,
but
i
thought
the...
that
this
court's
precedent
said
you
have
to
make
a
ruling,
did
it
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
before
you
get
to
qualified
immunity.
unknown
speaker
that
may
well
be,
but
you
don't
have
to
argue
it.
my
point
was
that
you--
unknown
speaker
--didn't
have
to
argue
it--
unknown
speaker
--not
that
we
don't
have
to
decide
it.
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
have
a
bad
motive?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
cordray.
mr.
schlick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
so
do
you
say
this
is
just
a
technical
mistake?
if
it
said,
go
to
the
empire
state
building
and
seize
the
empire
state
building,
that's
just
a
technical
mistake?
i
mean,
they
may
have
made
it
for
a
technical
reason,
but
you'd
have
no
idea
what
they're
supposed
to
look
for.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
isn't
clear.
how
is
it
clear?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
here
it's
clear
because
the
affidavit
said
it,
but
the
affidavit's
locked
away
somewhere
and
nobody
can
look
at
it.
unknown
speaker
so,
in
fact,
what
a
homeowner's
supposed
to
do
is
if
the
warrant...
he
looks
at
it,
by
the
way,
it's
blank,
it's
blank.
and
the
officer
says,
don't
worry,
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
what
i'm
looking
for,
but
just
go
somewhere
to
a
court
house
and
make
a
motion
to
unseal
an
affidavit
and
that
will
solve
the
problem.
is...
is
that
what
the
fourth
amendment
is
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
want...
the...
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
envision
some
sort
of
a
collaborative
proceeding
where
there's
a
conversation
between
the
officers
executing
the
warrant
and
the
homeowner
and...
and
that...
that
seemed
to
me
without
foundation.
on
the
other
hand,
i
suppose
the
homeowner
has
a
right
to
look
at
the
warrant
and
to
comment...
to
comment
on
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
know,
but
there's
a
knock
on
the
door
and
the
policeman
says,
i
have
a
warrant.
and
i
say,
may
i
see
it?
he
says,
well,
oh
no,
you
can't
see
it
until
i
leave.
is
that...
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
if
they
have
a
warrant,
do
i
have
a
right
to
read
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
the
homeowner.
unknown
speaker
no,
there...
no,
there...
there's
no
exigency
because
there's
only
one
person
there
and
he's
at
the
door
and
that
person
says,
i'd
like
to
read
this
warrant.
does
he
have
the
right
to
do
that
before
the
officer
enters?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
in
our
rule
if...
if
you're
willing
to
concede
that
that's
a
constitutional
requirement?
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
you
say...
you
say
it's
part
of
the
reasonableness
requirement
to
show
it
to
the
homeowner
if
he
demands
it.
unknown
speaker
under
normal
circumstances,
when
there
is
no
exigency.
under
normal
circumstances,
if
the
homeowner
demands
to
see
the
warrant,
you
think
it
is
constitutionally
required
that
you
show
the
homeowner
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
your...
your
point
about
electronic
surveillance
seems
to
me
quite...
quite
forceful.
you
do...
you
do
not
have
to
give...
give
the
person
who's
being
electronically
surveilled
a...
a
warrant
beforehand.
he
has
no
opportunity
to
see
what's...
what's
being
done.
i
don't
see
why
the
constitutional
principle
would
differ
with
regard
to
a...
to
a
physical
search.
unknown
speaker
but
you...
but
you
are
saying
that
in...
in
circumstances,
you
gave
an
example,
the
reasonableness
requirement
would
result
in
an
obligation
to
show
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's...
let's
take...
let's...
let's
go
one
step
further
than
the...
than
the
hypothetical
you...
you
were
dealing
with
a
moment
ago.
let's
assume
the
homeowner
comes
to
the
door
and
says,
i'd
like
to
see
the
warrant.
and
they
say,
well,
here
it
is,
and
the
homeowner
says,
i...
i'd
like
to
read
it,
and
the
police
say,
no,
you
can't
read
it.
and
the
homeowner
says,
look,
i'll
give
you
whatever
you've
got
a
right
to
seize
under
this
warrant.
you
don't
have
to
tear
the
house
apart,
just
let
me
see
what
it
is
you
want.
the
police
answer,
no,
we're
not
going
to
tell
you,
we're
going
to
go
through
the
house
ourselves.
do
you
think
that
would
be
reasonable
execution
of
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
they
would
have
a
right
to...
to...
to
tear
the
house
apart
when
the
homeowner
stands
at
the
threshold
and
says,
tell
me
what
you've
got
a
right
to
seize
and
i'll
get
it
for
you.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
reasonable
search,
and
that
includes
an...
an
issue
about
the
manner
in
which
the
warrant
is
executed.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
suppose
that
the
officer
doesn't
have
to
take
the
word
of
the
homeowner
either
that
i'm
getting
you
exactly
what
you
want,
you
know,
if
the
guy's
charged
with
some
sort
of
fraud,
maybe
he's
going
to
continue.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
schlick,
as
far
as
the
rule
is
concerned,
the
rule...
the
heading
is
receipt,
so
the
rule...
rule
doesn't
address
this
problem.
it
goes
to
what
you
do
in
inventory
and
then
you
give
a
receipt,
if
you're
going
to
take
away
property
give
a
receipt,
and
by
the
way,
give
the
warrant
with
it.
so
i
don't
think
we
can
read
this
rule
as
saying
you
don't
have
to
give
the
warrant
if
the
homeowner
requests
it.
it
just
says
if
you're
taking
away
property
then
you
give
a
receipt,
and
part
of
the
receipt
is
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
had
been
on
the
way
to
the
residence
and
3
minutes
before
he
got
there,
the
residents
say,
oh,
this
is
a
terrible
mistake
here,
would
he
have
the
obligation
to
turn
around
and
go
back
or
have
somebody
bring
him
the
affidavit
out?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
that...
so
that
even
if
he
sees
the
mistake
before
he
makes
the
entry
on
the
premises,
he
can...
he
can
proceed?
unknown
speaker
and
under
these
facts?
unknown
speaker
well,
but...
but
then...
but
then
you're
saying
this
warrant
is
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
so...
so...
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
to
say
that
we
can
have
warrants
like
this
all
the
time
and
there's
no
problem.
unknown
speaker
talking
about
a
constitutional
minimum...
you
say
that
a
constitutional
minimum...
this
warrant
would...
is...
is
adequate
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
all
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
i
did
see
it.
i
did
look
at
that
and
it
occurred
to
me
at
that
moment
that
all
you're
asking
people
to
do
is
just
glance
at
the
document
quickly
to
catch
obvious
mistakes,
which
this
is.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
schlick.
mr.
kozakiewicz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
where...
where
do...
where
do
we
say
that?
did
we
say
that
in
a
case
that--
unknown
speaker
--if...
if...
if
that
is
indeed
the
purpose
of
the
warrant,
isn't
it
passing
strange
that
the
rules
relating
to
warrants
do
not
require
that
the
warrant
be
served,
be
presented
to
the
individual,
unless
and
until
something
is
taken,
at
which
point
the
warrant
has
to
be
left
plus
a
list
of
the
things
taken?
i
mean,
i
just
find
it
remarkable
that
our
rules
of
criminal
procedure
would
not
require
the
service
of
a
warrant,
and
indeed,
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
a
warrant,
what
do
you
do
about
warrants
for
electronic
surveillance,
for
wiretaps?
does...
do...
do
you
have
to
serve
the
object
of
the
wiretap
with
a
warrant
saying,
we're
going
to
be
tapping
your
phone,
so
he'll
say,
oh,
thank
you
very
much,
you
know,
i'll
use
another
phone.
unknown
speaker
it's
not...
what's
exigent...
what's
exigent
about
it?
not
necessarily,
i--
unknown
speaker
--counsel,
i
suppose
you
don't
have
to
take
the
position
that
there's
some
right
of
the
homeowner
to
examine
the
warrant
before
the
officer
is
admitted
to
the
home
to
win
this
case,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
why
are
you
taking
that
position
then?
that
gets
you
into
a
lot
of
hot
water,
because
it
hasn't
been
clearly
defined.
i
mean,
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
place
a
lot
of
weight
on
the
point,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
prevail
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
hear
your
views.
unknown
speaker
why,
when
mcgrew
didn't
issue
until
6
months
after
the
conduct
in
question?
mcgrew
set
the
circuit
law
for
the...
at
least
for
the
ninth.
it
said
that
the
executing
officer
has
to
read
the
warrant,
but
that
wasn't
on
the
books
when
this
search
occurred.
unknown
speaker
but
what
made
the
law
clear
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
not
the
timing
of
the
mcgrew
search,
but
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
i
see
that
there
is
a
serious
question,
i
think,
underlying
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying
that
this
is
really
a
question
of
cross-reference.
the
constitution
requires
the
warrant
to
describe
the
things
to
be
seized.
now,
what
the
government
says
is
this...
we
have
permitted
in
cases
that
requirement
to
be
fulfilled
where
the
warrant
piece
of
paper
is
perhaps
blank
or
erroneous,
but
it
cross-references
another
document.
and
you've
said,
it
can
do
that
where
that
other
document
is
physically
attached
or,
let's
say,
at
least
in
the
car.
there
was
one
case
that
said
in
the
car,
but
not
where
it's
in
a
vault
someplace.
and
justice
scalia,
i
think,
asked
why...
why
is
that?
because
if
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
to
alert
the
homeowner,
but
simply
to
be
certain
there
is
a
check
on
the
searcher,
why
have
the
cases
come
out
the
way
you've
just
described
them?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
abuse?
unknown
speaker
but
he
didn't,
and
that
goes
back
to
a
question
that
justice
scalia
raised
earlier.
assuming
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
you're
bringing
a
bivens
action,
and
if
we
recall
the
facts
in
bivens
that...
the
police
acted
as
rough
as
can
be,
they
manacled
the
man,
they
told
him
they
were
going
to
arrest
his
wife
and
children,
they
hauled
him
off
to
jail
and
they
strip-searched
him.
nothing
like
that
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
but
the
damages
here,
nothing
happened
here
that
would
not
have
happened
if
the
right
portion
of
the
application
had
been
copied
into
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
does
the
homeowner
say,
well,
i'd
like
to...
this
is
a
long
warrant,
i
have
to
sit
down
and
read
this,
and
they
sit
down
by
the
fire
and
read
the
warrant
and
discuss
it?
that's
not
the
way
it
works.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
we're
asking
what
the
general
requirement
is.
once...
once
the
homeowner
finds
that
the
police
have
the
authority
to
enter,
then
don't
the
cases
teach
us
that
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
is
to
control
the
discretion
of
the
officer,
not
the
knowledge
of
the
homeowner,
and
incidentally,
i
think
you
might
be
able
to
read
rule
41
as
saying
that
when
an
officer
leaves
he
has
to
give
a
copy
of
the
warrant
whether
he
takes
anything
or
not.
i'm...
i'm
quite
sure
that
that's
the
right
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
that's
done.
i
don't
think
the
homeowner
has
the
right
to
monitor
the
search.
there's...
there's
no
authority
for
that.
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
say...
think
that.
unknown
speaker
under
the
rule,
they
said?
under
the
rule?
well.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
true,
is
it?
i
mean,
you...
you
can
create
such
a
duty--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
rule
at
all,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
say
anything
at
all
about
warrant
when
no
property
is
taken.
as
far
as...
i
have
the
text
of
rule
41
in
front
of
me.
it
talks
about
leaving
the
warrant
when
you've
taken
property.
there's
not
one
word
in
this
that
i
can
see
about
leaving
the
warrant
when
you
haven't
taken
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
do
you...
do
you
have
to...
do
you
have
to
maintain
that
position
to
win
your
case?
i
mean,
do
you
have
to
get
us
to
accept
your...
that...
that
proposition
in
order
to
win
your
case?
unknown
speaker
can
we
get
back
to
the
question
i
think
that
you
hadn't
completed
your
answer
to
before?
so,
assuming
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
what
harm
to
this
family...
i
mean,
the
contrast
with
bivens
in
that
regard
is
stark,
because
the...
the...
what
you
recited,
the
same
thing
would
happen
if
the
warrant
had
copied
the
right
paragraph
of
the
application.
there
was
no
rough
stuff.
unknown
speaker
so--
--of
course,
that's
really
not
what
the
fourth
amendment
says,
is
it?
it
just...
it
doesn't
say
you
need...
you
need...
i
mean,
surely
there's
some
play
in
the
joints,
isn't
there?
it's...
it
categorically
prohibits
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
and
any
warrants,
you
know,
where
you
need
a
warrant
shall
particularly
describe
the...
the
person
or
place
to
be
searched
and
the
items
to
be
seized.
but
it
doesn't
say
categorically
that
you
can't...
you
need
a
warrant
all
the
time,
so
there's
some
play
in
the
joints.
why
couldn't
we
say
that
at
least
in
this
case
where
there
was
a
good-faith
attempt
to
get
a
warrant
and
where
the
affidavit
would
have
justified
a
warrant,
it
is
not
the
one
thing
that
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits,
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
to
go
ahead
with
this
defective
warrant?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
there's
nothing
in
the
fourth
amendment
that
requires
a
warrant,
even
for
the
entry
into
a
home,
and
as
you
know
of,
many
entries
into
homes
are
done
without
a
warrant
when
there
are
exigent
circumstances.
now,
if...
if
you
can
say
that
that
is
not
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
why
can
you
not
say
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
a
warrant
that
has
a...
a
technical...
clear
technical
defect,
but
nonetheless
was
sought
and...
and
would
have
issued
in
perfect
conformity
with
constitutional
requirements.
why
does
that
make
it
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure?
i
can
see
that
it
makes
it
a
search
and
seizure
without
a
proper
warrant
as
defined
in
article
iv...
in
the
fourth
amendment...
but
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
a
warrant
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
the
only
exception.
i
mean,
that's
one
exception
that...
that
we've
developed.
why
can't
we
say
another
exception
is
where
you've
done
everything
that
is
necessary
to
get
a
warrant,
and
the
warrant
you've
gotten,
yeah,
it
doesn't
really
comply
with
the
description
of
the
warrant
there,
but
still
to
proceed
that
way
is
not
unreasonable
search
and
seizure?
it's
mistaken
but
it's
not
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
unknown
speaker
are
you...
you
suggesting
that
maybe
it
was
unreasonable?
since
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
this
warrant
could
have
been
executed
the
next
day
for
as
far
as
we
know
from
this
record,
to
go
back
and
say,
oh
my
goodness,
look
at
this,
it's
a
general
warrant,
i
better
get
it
particularized.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
leon,
mr.
cordray
urged
that
if
you
would
meet
the
good-faith
exception,
in
any
case
where
the
good-faith
exception
would
apply
so
the
evidence
isn't
suppressed,
the
officer
would
have
qualified
immunity.
do
you
agree
that
that's
a...
a
proper
equation?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the--
--so
what
you
are
saying
is
not
because
the...
the
same
reason
it's
not
a
qualified
immunity
is
the
same
reason
it
isn't
an
unreasonable
search.
it
isn't
a
reasonable
search,
isn't
a
reasonable
search,
and
there
is
no
qualified
immunity
because
he
didn't
even
glance
at
the
document,
and
for
the
head
man
not
to
glance
at
the
document
is
not
good
faith
and
is
unreasonable.
if
that's
your
argument...
as
i
guess
you're
going
to
accept
this
now--
unknown
speaker
--all
right,
fine.
i'd
like
to
go
back
for
one
second
to
justice
ginsburg's...
one
of
her
initial
questions,
is,
what
is
it
you
are
seeking
here?
a
dollar
in
damages
and
an
apology?
because,
after
all,
if
you
accept
my
argument,
they
would
have
just
gone
back
and
gotten
a
better
warrant
and
it
would
have
taken
them
a
couple
of
hours
and
all
the
same
thing
would
have
happened.
so...
so
what...
what
is
it
you're
seeking
in
this
lawsuit?
an
apology
and
a
dollar
or
something
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
way
it
could
be
more
than
a
dollar?
unknown
speaker
what
have
you
asked
for
in
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
way
it
could
be
more
than
a
dollar?
i
mean,
you
must
have
thought
this
through,
because,
after
all,
you
have
filed
a
complaint
and
they
hired
you
and--
unknown
speaker
--is
different
from
what
it
would
have
happened
an
hour
later?
different
from
what--
unknown
speaker
--would
have
happened
if
they'd
corrected
the
error
and
gone
back
and
done
the
same
thing--
unknown
speaker
--because?
unknown
speaker
but
i...
i
thought
the
facts
say
that
they
correctly...
at
least
in
the
petitioner's
brief...
they
say
that
they
correctly
notified
the
homeowner
about
the
purpose
and
objects
of
the
search.
unknown
speaker
you
think
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
or
when
the
english
tradition
that
underlaid
the
fourth
amendment
was...
was
formed,
most
people
could
read
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
then...
then
do
you
think
the
homeowners
would
have
the
right
to
exclude
the
constable
until
he
could
get
somebody
who
was
literate
to
read
the
warrant
that
the
constable
presented
to
him?
maybe
call
his
attorney
and
say,
you
know,
there's
a
warrant
here
i
can't
read,
can
you
come
over
and
read
it
for
me?
they
didn't
have
telephones.
[laughter]
i
didn't
say
call
him
by
phone,
mr
chief
justice.
his
attorney
lived...
lived
across
the
street
actually.
i
mean,
this...
this
notion
that
this
is
part
of
the...
of
the
warrant
requirement,
it
seems
to
me,
is
based
on
a
real
misunderstanding
of...
people
couldn't
read,
most
of
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
might...
we...
maybe
we
should
add
that
requirement
to
the
fourth
amendment.
i
assume
we
could
amend
the
fourth
amendment
to
say,
in
addition
to
what
it
used
to
mean,
you
have
to
present
the
warrant
at
least
to
people
who
are
literate.
counsel,
if
we
conclude
that
there
is,
in
fact,
no
requirement,
as
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
think
there
was,
that
the
warrant
be
shown
to
the
homeowner
in
advance,
assume
that's
not
a
requirement.
what
are
the
damages
left
other
than
attorneys
fees?
unknown
speaker
are
you
really...
is
it
really
a
fight
about
attorneys'
fees
because
it's
taken
so
long
to
get
up
here?
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
it
will.
[laughter]
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
warrant?
everybody's
been
assuming
that
there's
only
one
particularity
requirement
in
the
constitution.
there
are
two.
there's
the...
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
also
the
items
to
be
seized,
and
i
was
wondering
if
one
couldn't
read
this
warrant
as
just
satisfying
the
particularity
requirement
with
regard
to
what
was
to
be
searched,
because
as
i
understand
it,
it
was...
the
ranch
was
a
very
big
ranch
and
they
only
wanted
to
search
this
one
house
with
a
couple
of...
the
garage
next
to
it,
and
they
didn't
search
the
entire
ranch,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
oh,
they
did?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
i
thought
one
might
read
the
warrant
as
describing
this
particular
blue...
blue
house
and
so
forth
as
the
particular
part
of
the
ranch
that
was
to
be
searched
for
the
guns
and
so
forth,
but
that's
not
the
case?
they
searched
everything?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
this
would
be...
no,
i
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
obviously
be
searching
for
the
blue
house,
but
you
might
read
this
as
having
confined
the
search
to
the
blue
house
as
opposed
to
the
entire
ranch,
which
is
described...
but
you...
but
that...
that
wasn't
done.
unknown
speaker
so
then
it
is
really
nonsensical
on
its
face.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
far
as
damages
are
concerned,
i
suppose
your
claim
is
analogous
to
a
common
law
trespass,
that
someone
has
come
on
the...
come
on
your
property
without
any
right
to
do
so,
and
so
you...
you
could
analogize
that
to
whatever
damages
you
could
get
for
a
trespass.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
did
make
some
kind
of
enumeration.
you
mentioned
mr.
ramirez's
drafting
table
was
broken
and
you
said
she
was
frightened,
and
i
think
one
other
thing
you
alleged.
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes,
the
reputation
to
the...
the
