mr.
richard
a.
cordray
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
reserve
2
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
this
case
concerns
a
mistaken
description
on
the
face
of
a
judicial
warrant
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
deprived
agent
groh
of
qualified
immunity,
subjecting
him
to
personal
liability
for
damages
in
this
bivens
action.
the
ninth
circuit
reached
this
result
despite
the
fact
that
the
record
here
shows
agent
groh's
manifest
good
faith
and
reasonable
course
of
conduct,
including
three
key
points.
first,
the
record
shows
that
the
affidavit
and
application
submitted
to
the
magistrate
were
sufficient
and
comprehensive.
second,
the
magistrate
personally
reviewed
and
approved
the
application
and
expressly
referenced
the
affidavit
in
the
warrant
he
issued.
and
third,
the
search
as
executed
conformed
to
the
limits
set
out
in
the
affidavit
and--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--the
constitution
provides
that
individuals
will
not
be
subject
to
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
that
warrants
will
not
issue
except
upon
probable
cause,
and
stating
with
particularity
the
items
to...
place
to
be
searched,
items
to
be
seized.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i
think
you
do
apply
it
in
this
case
and
this
warrant
here--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
the
warrant
itself...
and
if
we
turn
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
appendix,
page
26a,
specifically
references
the
affidavit.
the
affidavit,
application,
and
draft
warrant
form
were
submitted
to
the
magistrate
as
one
package.
they
were
reviewed
by
the
magistrate
and
resulted
in
an
issuance
of
authority
to
search--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--the
draft
of
the
warrant
form
itself
was
done
initially
by
agent
groh.
it
was
then
signed
and
executed
by
the
magistrate
who
approved
it.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it
did,
and
that's
the
mistaken
description
on
the
face
of
the
warrant.
if
you
look
at
the
application
and--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
i...
i
think
there's
two
questions
there.
i
think
if
you...
if
you
apply
the
constitutional
provision
here,
the
warrant
here
specifically
references
the
affidavit.
the
magistrate
says,
i
am
satisfied,
page
26a--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it
was
attached
to
the
warrant,
accompanied
the
warrant
when...
when
the
materials
went
to
the
magistrate
for
approval...
it
was--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it...
it
also
accompanied
the
warrant
when
the
officers
were
briefed
on
the
nature
of
the
search.
it
did
not
accompany
the
warrant
at
the
scene
because
it
was
placed
under
seal
by
the
court,
which
is
done
routinely
in
many
cases
for...
for
a
variety
of
important
law
enforcement
purposes.
but
here--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes,
although
this
court
has--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
the
sheppard
case
makes
clear...
footnote
7,
the
court
says
that
if
the
warrant
says,
has
some
sort
of
suitable
words
of
reference,
see
attached
affidavit
or
see
affidavit,
that
you
then
can
move
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
paper
itself
and
look
to
the
materials
that
are
part
of
the
document
or
your
record
in
front
of
the
magistrate
that
are
subject
to
subsequent
judicial
review,
and
the
contents
of
the
affidavit
can
inform
the
contents
of
the
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
they
were
on
all
fours
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
the
warrant
in
sheppard
was
facially
defective.
it
said
that
you
would
search
for
controlled
substances.
in
fact,
they
were
searching
for
evidence
of
homicide
investigation.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yeah,
in...
in
some
ways
worse,
because
it
specified
the
search
for
different
evidence.
here
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
warrant
it's
clear
that
there's
some
sort
of
discrepancy,
and
you
can
inform
that
by
looking
at
the
affidavit--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it
did
not,
in
fact,
and
the
court
said
that
if
it
had
contained
some
sort
of
cross-reference,
then
you
could
inform
the
contents
of
the
warrant
from
the
contents
of
the
affidavit.
that's
what
we
believe--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
think
that's--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i...
i
think
that
that's
not
true
in
the
important
respects
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
affidavit
was
part
of
the
documents
given
to
the
magistrate
for
prior
judicial
approval--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--what
i'm
saying
is
there
are
three
different
potential
times
that
matter
here.
one
is
prior
judicial
approval
of
the
search.
the
warrant
and
application
and
affidavit
were
all
together
to
the
magistrate.
second,
in
informing
the
officers
of
how
to
conduct
the
search,
which
they
did
here
in
accordance
with
the
constraints,
the...
the
material
was
provided
to
the
officers.
the
third
question
is
whether
the
homeowner
at
the
scene
has
some
independent
constitutional
right
to
see
the
warrant
and
the
supporting
materials
before
a
search
can
proceed.
this
court
has
never
held
that
that's
a
constitutional
requirement
and
would
be
flatly
inconsistent
with
criminal--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
this
warrant
specifically
references
the
affidavit
and
the
affidavit
accompanied
to
the
magistrate
and
to
the
officers
before
they
searched--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--well,
they
can,
in
fact,
because
the
documented
record
before
the
magistrate
allows
posterior
judicial
oversight
of
how
the
search--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that
is
correct.
at
the
scene...
the
ninth
circuit
made
a
fundamental
flaw
in
its
opinion.
it
assumed
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
about
allowing
homeowners
at
the
scene
to--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--correct.
and
they
had
the
warrant,
affidavit,
and
application--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--this
was
a
subject
of
discussion
in
sheppard.
the
separate
opinion
by
justice
stevens
states
specifically,
and
presents
an
argument
for
why
the
fourth
amendment
was
not
violated
in
that
case.
the
majority
was
willing
to
assume
a
violation
on
the
record
before
it,
didn't
specifically
decide
the
fourth
amendment
question
but
assumed
such
a
violation
and
went
on
to
apply
the
good
faith--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
would
agree
with
you
that--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
well--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--certainly
not,
your
honor,
and
i
do
agree
with
justice
ginsburg's
point
that
sheppard
is
probably
more
germane
to
the
qualified
immunity
inquiry
here
than
perhaps
to
the
fourth
amendment
inquiry,
given
that
the
court
did
not
explicitly
decide
the
fourth
amendment
issue
in
sheppard.
but
here,
we
would
say
that
qualified
immunity
applies
on
two
distinct
grounds.
first,
the
court
has
adverted
in
malley
v.
briggs,
it
wasn't
a
specific
holding,
that
if
in
fact
the
conduct
of
the
officers
is
such
that
the
good-faith
leon
exception
would
apply
in
a
criminal
suppression
hearing
then,
in
parallel,
qualified
immunity
should
apply
in
a
civil
action
against
the
officer.
that
would
be
one
ground
for
finding
qualified
immunity
here
and
a
sufficient
ground.
in
addition,
if
the
law
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time
that...
a
number
of
points
that
the
ninth
circuit
decided
for
the
first
time
in
this
case...
that
the
warrant
cannot,
by
suitable
words
of
reference,
incorporate
the
contents
of
the
affidavit.
number
two,
that
the
officers
are
obliged
constitutionally
after
a
warrant
issues
to
double
check
the
magistrate's
handiwork
and
correct
any
errors
that
they
find.
and
number
three,
that
they
cannot
at
the
scene,
as
agent
groh
attempted
reasonably
to
do
here,
inform
the
homeowner
of
exactly
what
the
nature
of
the
search
was.
it
was
done
verbally
in
person
with
the
wife
and
over
the
telephone
with
the
husband,
and--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--said
that
that
would
not
be
sufficient
to...
to
correct--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--didn't
specifically
hold
that,
but
certainly
seemed
to
presume
it,
that
the...
not
only
the
warrant
but
all
the
supporting
materials
so
that
the
homeowner
could
exercise
some
self-help
right
at
the
scene,
block
the
officers,
and
attempt
to
interfere
with
their
execution
of--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--criminal
rule
41,
which
this
court
has
said
incorporates
or
is
certainly
consistent
with
fourth
amendment
principles,
says
that
a
warrant
needs
to
be
left
at
the
scene
after
a
search
is
completed
if
property
is
taken
along
with
an
inventory
of
the
property.
there's
no
suggestion
the
rule
does
not
require
the
warrant
be
given
to
the
homeowners
at
the
outset
as
long
as
they're
reasonably
informed--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it...
it
talks
about
a
number
of
things.
it
talks
about
obtaining
a
warrant,
keeping
a
documentary
record
in
front
of
the
magistrate
so
that
subsequent
judicial
review
is
available.
it
also
talks
about
executing
the
warrant
at
the...
at
the
scene.
if
the
court
wishes
to
refer
to
criminal
rule
41,
it's
been
amended
a
couple
of
times,
i
believe
the
current
version
is
41(f)--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--it's
not
in
the
documents
here.
i
apologize,
your
honor.
but
41(f)(3),
it's
referred
to
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
in
our
brief,
is
that
they
must
give
a
copy
of
the
warrant,
receipt
for
the
property
taken,
after
the
search
is
completed,
but
not
before
the
search
begins,
and
that
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense.
the
fourth
amendment
is
about
making
sure
that
there
is...
there
is
prior
judicial
authority
to
proceed
with
a
search
and
that
there
is
documentation
available
later
to
check
the
search
and
make
sure
it
did
not
exceed
the
authority--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--yes,
which
agent
groh--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--i
believe
that
if...
if
he's
asked
for
the
warrant
before
he
can
enter,
what
would
be
reasonable
in
the
circumstances
would
be
to
show
the
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i...
i
believe
that
in
many
cases
that
would
be
the
most
reasonable
thing,
and
therefore
perhaps
the
constitution
would
have
required
it.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
i'm
not
certain
of
that,
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
practice
and
reasonable
conduct.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
yeah,
except
that
before
printing
the
affidavit--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--sure.
this
court
said
in
malley
that
if
in
fact
the
officers
make
a
mistake
of
fact
in
good
faith
that,
if
in
fact
leon
would
apply
to
avoid
suppressing
that
evidence
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
the
parallel
should
apply
and
qualified
immunity
would
be
appropriate
in
a
civil
action.
i
think
that
that
is
what
makes
the
most
sense
of
the
objective--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--the
magistrate--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--the
magistrate--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--the
magistrate
also
looked
at
this
piece
of
paper
and
failed
to
notice
the
error.
the
materials
were
made--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--because
he
signed
the
piece
of
paper.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
it's
hard
for
me
to
know
exactly
what
happened
subject
with
the
magistrate.
we
do
know
that
he
signed
the
warrant.
we
also
know
that
he
signed
the
application,
which
was
presented
to
him,
that
had
the
particular
description
of
the
items
to
be
seized.
that's
at
page
28a
of
the
appendix.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
let
me
bore
in
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
if
i
may,
on
both
counts.
first--
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
--that's
how
we
read
the
court's
cases,
at
least
to
the
last
6
or
7
years.
it's
been
a
pretty
consistent
approach.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
fine.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
fine.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
that's
fine.
let
me...
let
me
say,
under
massachusetts
v.
sheppard,
this
is
clearly
in
good
faith
here.
qualified
immunity
should
apply.
why?
because
this
agent
prepared
all
the
materials,
submitted
it
all
to
the
magistrate,
is
the
one
who
personally
had
the
interchange
with
the
magistrate
back
and
forth,
whereupon
the
magistrate
approves
the
search
and
executes
a
warrant.
he
did
not
catch
the
error,
that's
true.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
no,
i
mean
that
he...
he
acted
in
good
faith,
objectively,
reasonably
on
the
course
of
the
record.
he...
he
knew
what
search
he
was
asking
for.
he
submitted
those
materials.
there's
a
particular
list
of
the
items
to
be
seized
in
the
application
and
in
the
affidavit.
it
was
omitted
from
the
warrant.
that's
why
we're
here.
nonetheless,
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
case,
and
many
court
of
appeals
have
held
this,
in
which
leon
would
apply
in
a
criminal
suppression
hearing.
also,
the
ninth
circuit
here
reached
this
result
by
announcing
a
new
rule.
they
said
an
officer
has
a
duty
to
proofread
a
warrant
even
after
it's
issued
by
a
magistrate.
they
had
rejected
that
rule
in
marks
v.
clarke
just
a
year
earlier,
and
now
they
reversed
ground
and
they
announce
a
new
rule.
that
is
classically
the
basis
for
qualified
immunity
under
this
court's
strong
precedents
that
the...
the
officer
cannot
be
held
to
predict
the
future
course
of
constitutional
law.
should...
do
they
know
there's
a
fourth
amendment?
do
they
know
it
contains
a
particularity
requirement?
presumably
they
do.
but
do
they
know
how
that
applies
in
all
circumstances
and
that
they
have
a
duty
to
proofread
a
warrant
even
though
they've
made
out
the
materials,
they've
submitted
to
the
magistrate,
they've
been
there
with
the
magistrate
and
gotten
the
approval
as
they
assumed
that
they
saw
it?
massachusetts
v.
sheppard
very
strongly
says
that...
that
we
do
not
hold
the
officers
to
have
a
further
duty
in
that
instance.
if
you
hold
it
in
this
case
for
the
first
time
and
anew,
the
qualified
immunity
at
a
minimum
should
be
appropriate
for
the
officer
here.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
a.
cordray
your
honor,
on
the
qualified
immunity
point,
there
is
plain
language
in
the
constitution
as
to
what
the
fourth
amendment
says,
but
this
court
said
in
anderson
v.
creighton,
that
is
not
the
correct
approach.
it's
not
at
the
level
of
what
the
constitution
says
in
the
abstract.
it's
how
it's
applied
in
particular
circumstances.
and
here,
the
ninth
circuit
did
move
the
law
in
specific
respects,
and
this
court
is
being
asked
to
move
the
law
and
to
answer
questions
that
we
either
open,
and
in
fact
are
controverted
in
the
lower
courts
as
we
speak.
sheppard
had
established
that
you
can
go
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
page
of
the
warrant
to
look
at
supporting
materials
when
there's
any
kind
of
suitable
words
of
reference.
the
ninth
circuit
itself
has
clarified
since
this
case,
in
u.s.
v.
vesikuru,
314
f.
3d
1116,
suitable
words
of
reference
can
be
that
we're
relying
on
the
sworn
complaint
to
supply
probable
cause,
very
similar,
in
fact
indistinguishable,
from
the
words
of
reference
in
this
warrant
in
this
case.
you're
being
asked
to
retreat
from
sheppard
and
to
clarify
when
a
warrant
can
or
cannot
incorporate
accompanying
affidavit
materials
and
that's
a
question
you're
being
asked
to
answer
in
this
case
and
then
apply
against
this
officer
retrospectively
to
give
damages
and
deny
qualified
immunity.
that's
inappropriate
under
this
court's
settled
case
law.
second,
you're
being
asked
in
this
case
to
say
specifically
an
officer
has
a
constitutional
duty
to
proofread
and
re-check
a
