mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
i
will
come
to
your
question
in
just
a
moment.
the
petitioners
are
more
than
20
u.s.
companies
and
their
foreign
affiliates
who
were
caught
red-handed
perpetrating
the
most
damaging
anti-competitive
conspiracy
in
the
history
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
not
because
the
ftaia
applies.
we
have
to
prove
that
we
would
have
had
a
claim
before
the
sherman
act,
before
the
'82
act
was
adopted,
and
we
intend
to
do
so.
i
do
know...
do,
however,
think
that
the
'82
act
is
illuminating
because
it
eliminated
claims
of
other
people
and
not
ours,
and
that
would
be
the
victims
of
a
u.s.
export
cartel.
now,
the
reason
our
position
is
critical
is
the
one
identified
by
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is
that
the
conspirators'
cartel
encompassed
a
worldwide
market
for
bulk
vitamins
and
the
worldwide
market
is
relevant
because
geographic
boundaries
don't
have
any
meaning
here.
a
conspiracy
limited
to
u.s.
commerce
would
have
collapsed
as
u.s.
purchasers
bought
abroad,
as
justice
scalia
has
said,
and
there
is
a
critical
fact
about
the
nature
of
the
worldwide
market
and
how
the
united
states
enforces
the
antitrust
laws
that
has
not
been
touched
on
in
the
first
half
hour,
and
that
is
that
u.s.
antitrust
law...
and
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
prior
to
the
1982
act...
deems
their
conspiracy...
justice
breyer,
it's
not
the
individual
transactions,
it's
the
entire
conspiracy...
illegal,
lock,
stock,
and
barrel.
the
u.s.
government
in
this
case
prosecuted
the
petitioners
not
for
price-fixing
in
the
united
states
and
not
for
market
allocation
in
the
united
states,
but
price-fixing
and
market
allocation
in
the
united
states
and
abroad.
if
the
petitioners
are
right
about
what
the
sherman
act
means,
including
after
the
1982
act,
then
it
will
be
the
prosecutions
of
the
united
states
that
fall
along
with
our
position.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
breyer,
i'm
going
to
answer
it
in
three
parts
that
will
explain
why
it
is
that
you
can't
separate
the
civil
and
the
criminal
liability.
as
you
know
much
better
than
me,
what's
good
for
goose
is
good
for
the
gander.
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
says
if
it's
illegal
and
it
can
be
prosecuted,
then
there's
a
civil
right
of
action
for
it.
so
here
are
my
three
parts.
the
first
is
the
case
law.
american
tobacco,
national
lead,
timken
roller
bearing,
these
are
the
three
principal
cartel
cases
that
are
discussed
in
our
brief.
those
cases
do
not
say
that
the
quinine
cartel
was
illegal
insofar
as
it
hurt
us.
it's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it's
illegal,
including
the
sales
in
ecuador
and
in
holland.
justice
breyer,
i...
i
urge
you
to
go
to
the
indictment
in
this
case,
which
is
at
the
rollover
between
pages
1
and
2
of
our
red
brief.
in
this
case,
the
federal
government
prosecuted
mr.
shapiro's
clients
for
price-fixing
and
market
allocation
in
the
united
states
and
abroad.
that
is,
we
don't
care
that
ecuador
likes
price-fixing.
i
will
come
to
the
fact
that
they
don't,
but
it
doesn't
matter.
the
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
reaches
the
conspiracy
and
this
court's
precedents
reach
every
bit,
as
i
said,
lock,
stock,
and
barrel.
now,
let
me
give
you
the
reason
why.
that
was
your
question.
okay,
assume...
you
wanted
to
know
congress
made
that
choice,
and
it
made
that
choice
because,
as
justice
scalia
explained,
we
can't
separate
what
happens
in
ecuador
from
what
happens
in
u.s.
commerce.
it
doesn't
make,
in
terms
of
protecting
our
consumers
and
our
economy,
it
makes
no
difference
at
all
whether
the
sale
was
between
holland
and
holland,
new
jersey,
or
instead
holland
and
ecuador,
because
the
cartel
gets
sustained,
and
that's
also
the
point
of
pfizer.
so
congress
recognized
that
and
it
made
the
cartel--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
accept
that
as
correct,
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--and
it...
and
we
accept
it.
[laughter]
with
good
reason,
i
think.
mr.
chief
justice,
our
point
is
that
the
rationale...
i
don't
want
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
answer
is
that
the...
let
me
take
you
to
the
text
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
which
i
know
you
know,
but
it
can't
hurt
to
come
to
it,
and
that's
at
the
page
1a
of
the
red
brief.
the
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
says,
any
person
who
shall
be
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
anything
forbidden
in
the
antitrust
laws
has
the
cause
of
action,
and
that's
what
congress
said.
it's
not,
justice
breyer,
merely
that
we
say,
we
think
you
shouldn't
do
this
in
ecuador.
it
is,
you
may
not
do
it
in
ecuador
in
order
to
defeat
the
cartel
on
the
whole.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay,
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
let
me
tell
you
why
i
think
that
is
contrary
to
settled
precedents,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
these
are
precedents
just
like
rose
v.
lundy
that
congress
would
have
had
in
mind
in
the
1982
act.
so
i
want
to
talk,
justice
scalia,
about
pre-1982
law
on
whether
or
not
the
sherman
act
actually
made
the
transactions,
if
we
were
to
focus
on
them,
illegal.
and
then,
justice
breyer,
i
want
to
come
to
whether
the
'82
act
changes
that.
justice
scalia,
the
decree
in
national
lead
affirmed
by
this
court,
which
is
at
pages
330
to
331
of
the
court's
opinion,
cancelled
contracts
that
were
in
purely
foreign
commerce.
to
read
from
the
opinion
that...
that
established
the
decree,
several
agreements
relating
to
manufacture
and
trade,
we
deem
the
european
markets
are
but
some
of
the
links
in
the
chain
which
was
designed
to
enthrall
the
entire
commerce
in
titanium.
timken
roller
bearing
did
the
exact
same
thing,
and
the
solicitor
general
argued
in
timken
that
acts
would
have...
that
those
acts
would
have
violated
the
sherman
act
even
if
they
had
related
solely
to
the
commerce
of
the
foreign
nations.
those
precedents,
justice
scalia,
if
you
look
at
them,
do
say
that
the
underlying
activities
that
are
in
the
overt
acts,
if
you
will,
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
are
illegal
under
u.s.
law,
and
that's
for
a
good
reason.
that
is,
if
we
don't
go
after
them,
the
conspiracy
itself
will
be
sustained.
you
have
to
attack
the
conspiracy
and
what
the
conspirators
are
actually
doing.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
absolutely,
justice
souter.
i
have
to
take
this...
there
are...
there
are
three
parts
to
the
equation,
and
let
me
just,
at
each
stage,
because
it
can
get
very
complicated,
talk
about
where
we
are
in
the
logic.
there
is
the
question,
does
the
sherman
act
apply?
there
is
the
second
question,
okay,
is
there
a
private
right
of
action?
and,
justice
souter,
you
identified
the
third
part
to
it.
what
does
comity
have
to
say
about
it?
what
do
we
do,
assuming
even
if
nominally
the
statute
applies
and
they
can
sue,
but
it
nonetheless
would
bring
us
into
conflict
with
our
trading
partners.
so
i
was
answering,
justice
scalia,
on
the
first.
justice
breyer
and
you
have
taken
me
to
the
second,
and
that
is,
is
there
a
private
right
of
action,
particularly
after
the
1982
act?
two
facts
about
the
1982
act.
first,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
its
purpose,
and
it's
reflected
in
the
introductory
clause,
and
let
me
take
you
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
did
in
the
sense
of
saying--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
did
in
a
particular
sense,
yes.
i'm
not
trying
to
quibble.
it
said
that
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
said
that
the
ftaia,
the
'82
act
didn't
bar
our
claim.
we
think
that's
right
for
two
reasons,
the
first
it
doesn't
apply
at
all,
and
the
second
is
that
clause
2,
which
is
what
gave
rise
to
the
split
in
the
circuits,
doesn't
require
that
the
person's
injury,
that
the
person's
injury
arise
from
an
effect
on
u.s.
commerce.
it
accepted
the
second
of
those
propositions,
and
so
i'll
start
with
it,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
the
text
is
at
page
1a
of
the
red
brief.
i
think
it's
helpful
to
go
there.
this
is
a
limit,
by
the
way,
of
course,
on
both
private
rights
of
actions
and
the
actions
by
the
government,
and
so
what
happens
to
us
is
going
to
happen
to
federal
prosecutors.
it
says,
it's
the
second
statute
listed,
sections
1
to
7
of
this
title,
that
is
the
sherman
act,
shall
not
apply
to
conduct.
it's
focusing
there
on
the
conspiracy,
all
agree
here
that
the
conduct
covered
by
the
ftaia
is
the
illegal
conspiracy.
so
conduct
involving
trade
or
commerce
other
than
import
trade
or
import
commerce
with
foreign
national
unless
two
conditions
are
satisfied.
the
one
is
the
substantial
effect
on
u.s.
commerce,
and
they
admit
they
sold
billions
of
dollars
of
vitamins
in
the
united
states
as
part
of
the
worldwide
market.
and
second,
such
effect...
and
so
the
effect
here
is
the
effect
of
the
conspiracy
on
u.s.
commerce...
gives
rise
to
a
claim
under
provision...
under
the
provisions
of
sections
1
to
7
of
this
title,
i.
e,
under
the
sherman
act.
what
that
statute
does
is
determines
whether
the
conspiracy
itself
falls
within
the
sherman
act.
it
is
not...
and
as
its
structure
indicates,
it's
not
about
whether
a
particular
individual's
claims
comes
within
it.
remember
the
structure
is,
this
conduct,
the
conspiracy,
is
illegal
or
not
depending
on
whether
or
not
these
two
criteria
are
met.
now,
this
is...
our
reading
of
it
is
the
one
that
was
adopted
by
the
united
states
when
the
act
was
adopted,
by
every
single
antitrust
treatise,
every
single
article
interpreting
the
ftaia
at
the
time.
they
all
recognized
that
what
clause
2
does
is
requires
that
the
effect
required
by
clause
1,
that
is,
the
effect
on
u.s.
commerce,
be
an
anti-competitive
effect.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
its
bottom
line.
you
asked
a
question
in
the
first
minute,
how
in
the
world
are
we
going
to
tell
if
some
other
person
has
a
claim,
and
that...
we
agree
with
you,
that
is
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
as
between
the
two
sort
of
reticulated
versions
of
clause
2,
the
second
circuit
is
the...
is
the
reading
of
the
statute.
it
comes
out
the
exact
same
way,
but
it's
the
analysis
of
the
second
circuit
that's
right.
the
second
circuit
said,
before
the
1982
act
was
adopted
there
was
a
split.
we
didn't
know
if
in
order
to
trigger
the
sherman
act,
the
effect
that
was
required
on
u.s.
commerce
had
to
pro-competitive
or
anti-competitive.
there
was
a
rule
of
the
second
circuit
in
a
case
called
national
bank
of
canada
that
says,
look,
it's
not
good
enough
to
bring
in
the
sherman
act
if
there's
an
increase
in
exports
or
more
jobs.
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
it
has
to
be
anti-competitive
here.
and
so
that...
the
aba
submitted
comments
on
the
original
version
of
the
1982
bill,
and
it
said,
look,
in
order
for
the
sherman
act
to
apply,
there's
got
to
be
a
problem
in
our
country,
and
so
they
added
clause
2,
and
that's,
as
i
said,
the
united
states
said
so
in
1982,
in
1983,
every
treatise
did,
every
antitrust
commentator.
so
that's
what
clause
2
does.
it
says,
look,
we
are
concerned
when
our
economy
is
being
hurt,
and
that's
a
limit
on
us,
and
in
the
antitrust
guidelines,
the
government
says
that's
a
limit
on
them
too.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you.
let
me
put
us
in
the
analytical
framework
again,
and
that
is,
we
understand,
let's...
we're
assuming
the
sherman
act
applies
and
that
there
is
a
right
to
sue
in
theory.
now,
are
there
other
limitations?
let
me
be
very
clear
on
the
fact
that
these
are
three
separate
issues
and
then
apply
the
third
prong.
this
was
settled
in
hartford
fire.
mr.
shapiro
is
relying
on
the
dissent
in
hartford
fire
for
the
proposition
that
comity
concerns
are
built
into
the
definition
in
the
sherman
act.
that
is
the
position
that
the
majority
rejected.
and
although
he
says
the
issue
is
nonetheless
here,
his
page...
page
41,
note
16
of
their
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
acknowledged
that
the
question
is
different
from
the
question
of
comity
presented
in
hartford
fire.
so
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
understand.
justice
kennedy,
the
courts
of
appeals
leading
up
to
hartford
fire
were
unanimous
and
then
hartford
fire
cites
with
approval,
for
example,
a
case
called
mannington
mills,
and
that
is
that
the
courts
of
appeals
had
always
understood
up
to
the
point
of
hartford
fire,
and
then
hartford
fire
applied
the
same
analysis,
that
comity
is
a
restriction
on
the
exercise
of
the
jurisdiction
conferred
by
the
sherman
act,
and
so
hartford
fire
endorses
it.
and
then
subsequent
to
hartford
fire...
and
justice
breyer,
i
am
coming
back
to
the
substance
of
the
comity
analysis...
but
let
me
just
say
that
subsequent
to
hartford
fire,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
applied
comity
robustly.
let
me
just
cite
two
cases
for
you,
metro
industries,
which
is
82
f.
3d
839,
and
nippon
paper,
109
f.
3d
1.
they
have
continued
to
look
at
all
of
the
different
considerations.
and
so,
just
to
return
to
structure
and
then
to
substance,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
cause
to
consider
whether
or
not
this
case
would
interfere
with
international
relations.
now,
that
analysis
in
the
case
of
monopolization
or
unfair
trade
practices
would
preclude
the
exercise
of
u.s.
antitrust
jurisdictions
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is,
here
in
our
case
we
have
an
international
norm.
everybody
hates
price-fixing.
our
brief
details--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
so
justice
breyer,
i'm
going
to
put
on
the
table
for
a
second
whether
or
not
our
law
applies
at
all.
in
detour,
justice
ginsburg,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
that,
if
we
were
to
say
that
our
choice
of
treble
damages
and
their
choice
of
single
damages
represented
a
true
conflict,
and
that
is
we
were
undercutting
a
policy
judgment
by
them,
the
solution
would
not
be
to
eliminate
the
jurisdiction
that
congress
conferred
in
the
sherman
act.
it
would
be
to
say
you
can't
get
greater
damages
here
than
single
damages,
because
that's
the
norm.
that
would
be
the
solution.
if
the
position
is
that
comity,
congress
intended
comity
to
carve
back,
what
you
would
say
is
that
congress
would
have
intended
in
this
instance
not
to
allow
the
foreigners
to
get
treble
damages.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
absolutely.
there's
no
question
that...
i
just
cannot
remind
you
enough
times
that
the
petitioners
are
attempting
to
seriously
jump
the
gun.
there
was
no
forum
non
conveniens
argument
below,
there
was
no
comity
argument
below,
there
was
no
conflict
of
laws
argument.
all
of
those...
for
example,
if
there
is
a
legit...
and
in
fact
i
can
give
you
an
illustration.
there
is
a
private
class
action
ongoing
in
australia.
we
have
already
had
one
of
our
claimants
drop
out
of
the
case
and
go
to
australia,
because
everyone
recognizes
that's
where
your
remedy
is
at.
we
have,
however,
a
dilemma
that
congress
recognized,
and
that
is,
as
justice
scalia
said,
with
respect
to
the
great
majority
of
the
world,
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
oecd's
formal
report
on
cartels,
the
seminal
report
to
the
attorney
general
on
international
antitrust,
a
source
after
source
after
source
that
says
there
is
grave
under
enforcement
of
cartels,
and
i
can
illustrate
it
here
with
two
facts.
the
first
is,
with
respect
to
more
than
half
of
the
volume
of
commerce
in
bulk
vitamins,
more
than
half
of
it,
they
are
going
to
get
away
with
it.
and
that
leads
to
the
second
fact,
because
there's
no
enforcement,
public
or
private,
that
leads
to
the
second
fact,
and
that
is,
if
they
win
here,
they
will
net
from
activities
that
are
per
se
illegal
under
sherman
act,
net,
net,
net,
$13
billion.
that
is
not
a
message
of
deterrence.
so,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
quite
right.
there
are
mechanisms
for
dealing
with
the
fact
that
there
are
other
remedies.
i
would
just
put
back
on
the
table
the
one
that
says,
look
congress
would
not
have
intended--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it...
it's
the
judgment
that
congress
made,
justice
breyer,
in
the
worldwide
markets
that
justice
kennedy
referenced
in
the
first
half
hour,
and
that
is
that
we
will
be
hurt,
unless
we
go
after
them.
but
it
doesn't
mean,
justice
breyer,
that
we
go
after
them
for
every
section
1
or
every
section
2
violation.
so
let
me
come
all
the
way
back
to
your
original
question,
and
that
is,
okay,
why
is
the
comity
analysis
different
here
and
there?
justice
ginsburg
pointed
to
one
argument
that
i
was
making,
that's
this
is
per
se
illegal.
it
is...
the
second
point
is
that
there
are
disagreements,
it's
related,
there
are
disagreements
about
whether
the
primary
conduct
is
illegal
in
that
instance.
they
don't
think
a
monopoly
is
a
bad
thing.
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
everyone
agrees
that
price-fixing
is
bad.
it
is
not
an
infringement
on
their
ability
to
regulate
primary
conduct.
if,
for
example,
there
was
a
country
that
said,
we
love
price-fixing,
i
mean,
we
just
think
it's
so
much
better
if
things
are
expensive,
well,
then
that
might
be
a
different
case
and
there
might
be
a
forum
non
motion,
but
there
are
no
such
countries.
so
it
is
a
very,
very,
very
different--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
i...
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
it
is
not
sufficient
for
me
just
to
say,
look,
there'll
be
a
comity
analysis
later
in
the
day.
but
i
would
say
that
we
are
articulating
a
rule,
and
it
is
a
rule
that
is
limited
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
rule,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
sherman
act
applies,
but
unless
there
is
a
worldwide
market,
so
that
we
can
say
that
the
injury
to
the
person
abroad
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
injury
to
the
person
here,
that
claim
lacks
antitrust
standing
because
it
will
not
directly
advance
u.s.
interests.
it
is
not
necessary
to
advance
the
protection
of
u.s.--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
we're...
justice
kennedy,
let
me
relate
this
to
your
question.
that
is,
justice
breyer
is
saying,
look,
the
first
argument
in
the
red
brief
is
this,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
effects
in
the
united
states...
and
i
will
come
to
your
illinois
brick
objection,
justice
scalia...
the...
the
effects
in
the
united
states
did
give
rise
to
our
claims.
he
says,
accept
what
they
say,
accept
the
fifth
circuit's
rule.
look,
if
the
cartel
had
not
operated
in
this
country,
it
would
have
collapsed,
he
doesn't
need
a
nobel
prize,
we
have
one
in
case
you
did,
and
that
means
that
our
people
were
injured.
we
accept
that.
it's
the
first
argument
in
our
brief.
it
means
that
the...
it
limits
out
all
of
the
cases
that
you
were
worried
about,
justice
breyer,
because
in
a
monopolization
case
that
won't
be
true,
unfair
trade
practices,
that
won't
be
true.
and
then,
justice
ginsburg,
notwithstanding
that
we
have
a
narrow
field
of
cartel
cases,
there
are
only
six
that
have
been
filed,
there
are
still
other
options
on
the
table
for
limiting
the
claim
in
the
instance
that
there
is
an
available
foreign
remedy.
so
that's
how
it
would
work.
we
would
accept
their
argument,
we
would
say
there's
a
narrow
class
of
cases
that,
justice
kennedy,
are
a
true
worldwide
market
where
congress
recognized
that,
in
cases
like
american
tobacco
that
it
had
in
mind
in
the
1982
act,
and
then
we
say,
look,
that's
it,
that's
the
full
ball
of
wax,
we
don't
become
an
imperial
source
of
law
for
the
world.
that's
how
we
would
analyze
the
case.
now,
we
think
that
that
too
addresses
any
concerns
about
manageability--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
would
reject
claims
from
places
like
australia
and
canada
and
the
like,
that's
right.
if
they
have
any
sort
of
regime
that
they
have
decided
to
build
up,
if
they've
enacted
into
law,
and
it's
a
viable
regime
for
vindicating
interests,
so
that
the
client
being
here
isn't
necessary--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
is
that
forum
non
conveniens
is
a
principle
that's
generally
applicable
to
the
law
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
that's
right.
i
think
justice
ginsburg's
view
is
that
where
we
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
those
factors
are
relevant.
i
think
that
a
principle
factor
in
the
forum
non
analysis
would
be,
could
you
go
somewhere
else
and
vindicate
your
claim?
i
think
maybe
that
should
be
a
very
important
part
of
the
analysis.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
they
do
have
a
competition
law.
they've
filed
a
brief
in
this
case,
as
have
a
limited
number
of
nations.
justice
scalia
points
out
that
most
don't,
and
that's,
i
think,
an
important
manageability--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
then
misspoke,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
you
sure
did.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
i
then
misspoke.
if
you...
i
think
there's
an
extremely
strong
argument
that
if
you
can
go
somewhere
else,
if
there's
some
substantial
remedy
available
in
another
country,
then
you
can
go
somewhere
else.
but
they
didn't
file
that
motion
because
they're
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
case
with
respect
to
the
majority
of
bulk
vitamins
commerce
and
with
respect
to
most
of
the
commerce
in
these
worldwide
markets
for
which
there
is
no
remedy.
that's
just
a
fact.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
are
three
answers,
justice
scalia.
the
first
two
relate
to
the
technical
requirements
of
illinois
brick
and
the
third
explains
why
you
shouldn't
read
illinois
brick
to
bar
such
claims.
the
first
is
that
we're
not
merely
talking
about
arbitragers.
we're
talking
about,
there
are
companies
in
the
united
states
that
made
vitamins
and
they
would
have
sold
to
our
clients
absent
the
cartel.
the
intermediary
isn't
a
necessary
part
of
the
picture.
the
second
is
that
even
though
you
buy
from
an
intermediary,
under
illinois
brick
you
still
have
a
claim,
and
that
is
you
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action
for
an
injunction.
the
third
is
that,
look,
our
reading,
the
one
that
says,
and
that
justice
breyer
has
hypothesized,
accept
what
they're
saying
and
allow
the
claim
only
if
the
injury
is
tied
into
a
worldwide
market.
that's
a
reading
that
protects
u.s.
interests.
to
say
that
congress
set
up
the
structure,
whereas...
that
would
allow
you
to
look
at
the
foreigners
through
clause
2,
but
eliminate
of
their
claims
on
illinois
brick
grounds,
would
render
the
statute
and
its...
its
provisions
against
cartels
ineffectual.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
two
answers,
justice
scalia.
the
first
is,
i
disagree.
they
do
not
concede
that.
they
regard
that
as
a
hypothetical
purchase,
to
use
mr.
shapiro's
words,
it
didn't
happen.
and
the
second
is,
and
this
goes
back,
justice
ginsburg,
to
a
question
you
asked
in
the
first
half
hour,
the
reason
we
don't
have...
thank
you.
