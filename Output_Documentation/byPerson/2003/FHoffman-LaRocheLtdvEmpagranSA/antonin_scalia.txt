justice
scalia
the...
the
claim
here
is
that
because
of
the...
because
of
the
worldwide
nature
of
the
market,
our
foreign
commerce
is
necessarily
injured,
because
the
market
being
worldwide,
if
a
lower
charge
had
been
assessed
in
the
united
states,
which
would
have
been
the
case
absent
the
alleged
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws,
there
would
have
been
arbitrage,
and
we
would
have
exported
some
of
these
drugs
abroad
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
had
been
purchased
at
lower
prices
in
the
united
states.
why...
why
doesn't
that
make
out
an
injury
to
foreign
commerce?
justice
scalia
no,
but
there...
there
was
an
overcharge
in
the
united
states.
you're...
you're
not--
justice
scalia
--contesting
that...
that--
justice
scalia
--that
the
conspiracy
included
the
united
states?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
effect
on
foreign
commerce.
if
there
had
not
been
the
overcharge
in
the
united
states,
if
realistic
market-based
prices
had
been
charged
in
the
united
states,
we
would
have
re-exported
a
lot
of
these
drugs
to
foreign
countries
that
were
still
being
overcharged,
wouldn't
we?
justice
scalia
--i
would
think
your
defense
against
that
is...
is...
is
not
to
assert
that
there's
no
effect
on...
on
foreign
commerce,
on
our
exports,
because
i
think...
i
think
there
is.
i...
i
would...
i
would
think
your
defense
is...
is
in...
in
section
2
of
the
foreign
trade
antitrust
improvements
act,
which
requires
that
this
effect
on
commerce,
on
export
commerce,
gives
rise
to
a
claim
under
the
provisions
of
sections
1
to
7,
and...
and
the
only
way
it
gives
rise
to
a
claim
on
the
part
of
these
people
is
a
claim
as
second
purchasers,
and
illinois
brick
would
have
excluded
their
claim,
i
assume,
if
they
are
re-buying
from
the...
the...
from
people
in
the
united
states.
wouldn't
that
be
the
case?
justice
scalia
no,
they...
they're
alleging
that
they
would
have
purchased
from...
from
americans.
that
would
have
been
down
the
stream,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
these
are
nations
with...
with
fairly
effective
antitrust
laws
and
antitrust
enforcement.
justice
scalia
what
about
the
majorities
of
nations
in
the
world
that
don't
have
effective
antitrust
enforcement,
if
indeed
they
have
any
antitrust
laws?
might
they
not
be
eager
to
have
us
do
the
job
for
them?
justice
scalia
i'm...
i'm
not...
i
got
off
the
train
even
earlier.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
when
an
indictment
describes
an
international
conspiracy
as
an
international
conspiracy,
it
amounts
to
saying
that
that
portion
of
the
international
conspiracy
which
does
not
affect
this
country
in
any
way
is
illegal.
i
don't
think
that...
i
think
you're
bound
in
your
indictment
to
describe
the...
the
actual
conspiracy,
and
if
it
indeed
is
one
that
covered
the
whole
world,
you're...
are
you
supposed
to
describe
it
as
one
that
only
applied
to
the
united
states?
of
course
not.
you
describe
the
actual
conspiracy.
that
does
not
prove
that
the
portion
of
it
which
does
not
affect
the
united
states
is
in
any
sense
illegal
under
united
states
law.
i
don't
think
it
is
illegal.
justice
scalia
but
would
you
get
to
my
illinois
brick
question
before
your
time
runs
out.
justice
scalia
and
just
so
i
put
the
question
as...
as
clearly
as
possible,
it
seems
extraordinary
to
me
that
if
this...
if
a
foreign
company
had
been
injured
by
buying
drugs
from
an
american
company
that
bought
them
from
the
conspirators
at
an
excessively
high
price,
that
foreign
company
would
not
have
a
cause
of
action.
but
you're
saying
that
a
foreign
company
has
a
cause
of
action
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
had
the
american
company
not
purchased
at
the
artificially
high
conspiratorial
price,
but
at
a
lower
price,
they
might
have
purchased
from
that...
from
that
intermediate
person,
and...
whereas
illinois
brick
would
clearly
bar
the
first
suit,
you're
saying
it
doesn't
bar
the
second
suit
as
a
rationale
for
allowing
them
to
sue
here,
and
that
strikes
me
as
very
strange.
justice
scalia
as
far
as
your
first
point
is
concerned,
i
understand
the
other
side
to
concede
that
if
you
could
demonstrate
that
you
would
have
bought
from
one
of
these
american
companies
that
manufactured
in
connection
with
this
conspiracy
and
sold
at
the
conspiratorial
price,
you
would...
you
would
have
a
cause
of
action.
that
clearly
would
have...
would...
would
be...
affect
the
export
commerce
from
the
united
states.
