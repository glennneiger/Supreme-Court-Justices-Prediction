let's...
let's
assume
that...
that
we
find
the
textual
argument
in...
in
effect
a...
a
draw.
one
way
to
go
your
way
would
be
to
accept
a
comity
analysis,
but
i
take
it
comity
was
never
raised.
justice
souter
well,
if
we...
if
we
accept
that
and
textually
the
statute
is
a
draw,
we...
we
wouldn't
have
to
get
to
this
interpretative
principle.
i
mean,
one
reason
for
getting
to
the
interpretative
principle
that
you
now
suggest
is...
is
simply
the
submissions
of...
of
foreign
countries
as
well
as
the
united
states
in
this
particular
case.
justice
souter
well,
their
argument
is
that
these
cases
simply
come
together
anyway,
these
cases
will
piggyback
their
way
in
or
at
least
come
hand
in
hand
with
the
domestic
cases.
justice
souter
can
you
tell
us
how...
how
it
would
jeopardize
your...
your
efforts?
suppose
we
rule
for
the
respondent
here,
wouldn't
that
make
foreign
conspirators
and...
and
american
companies
all
the
more
eager
to
come
to
you,
because
then
they
could
get
immunity
both
for
u.s.
actions
and...
and
the
global
effects?
justice
souter
i
don't
follow
the--
--i...
i
thought
hartford
left
that
question
open.
justice
souter
i
mean,
hartford
specifically
addressed
the
export,
but
it...
it...
my
recollection
is,
in
the
footnote,
it
expressly
left
any...
any
further
effect
of
the
statute
in
open
question.
