justice
ginsburg
suppose
they...
suppose
these
foreign
buyers
had
alleged,
well,
they
heard
that
the
united
states
is
a
good
place
to
buy
things
and
they
tried
to
buy
the
vitamins
in
the
united
states
and
found
the
same
rigged
prices?
justice
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
if
that
would
do
under
your
theory.
they
said,
we
really
wanted
to
make
these
purchases
in
the
united
states.
justice
ginsburg
suppose
they
show
that
they
in
fact
attempted
to
buy
drugs
here
and
they
found...
vitamins
here...
and
they
found
that
the
price
was
the
same.
justice
ginsburg
could
you
just
deny
class
action
certification
if
that's...
if
you
have
that
kind
of
problem,
but
no...
nobody,
none
of
these
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
sue
on
behalf
of
the
whole
world.
justice
ginsburg
has
any
federal
court
ever
certified
a
class
that
size,
that
all
purchases
around
the
globe?
justice
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
may
i
stop
you
there,
because
you
are
dividing
the
universe
up
in
to
claims
that
everybody
agrees
and
more
controversial
applications
of
u.s.
antitrust
law,
but
one
of
the
principal
objections,
as
i
understand
it,
from
other
nations
is
to
the
treble
damages
feature.
they
say,
for
their
consumers,
the
way
they
regulate
antitrust,
there
are
no
treble
damages.
justice
ginsburg
what
about
a
forum
non
conveniens
policy
that
says,
you're
a
foreign
purchaser,
you
purchased
abroad,
you
have
a
nice
forum
abroad
to
go
to,
don't
burden
the
u.s.
courts.
justice
ginsburg
if
you
think
that
the
forum
non
conveniens
point
would
work,
let's
say,
for
our
trading
partners
who
have
told
us
they
don't
like
treble
damages
in
any
case,
so
are
we
going
to
make
a
distinction
then
and
accept
the
complaint
of
customers,
purchasers
of
vitamins
in
countries
that
don't
have
any
antitrust
laws,
but
we
would
reject
claims
coming
from,
say,
the
u.k.
or
canada?
