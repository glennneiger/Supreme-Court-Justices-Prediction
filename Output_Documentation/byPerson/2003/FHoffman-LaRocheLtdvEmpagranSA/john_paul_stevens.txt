mr.
shapiro,
can
i
ask
you
a
question--
justice
stevens
--about
your
theory,
about
your
theory?
what
if
the
plaintiff
is
engaged
in
business
in
both
the
united
states
and
in
a
foreign
market
and
suffers
injuries
in
both?
may
he
recover
for
both
injuries
or
only
the
injury
in
the
united
states
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
and
it...
would
that
have
been
the
case
before
this
statute
was
passed,
do
you
think?
justice
stevens
no.
the
injury
in
the...
under
the
statutory
language,
they
has
to...
the
plaintiff
has
to
suffer
an
injury
to
his
business
or
property,
but
you
say
that
does
not
include
the
business
or
property
that's
conducted
abroad?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that...
do
you
think
maintaining
that
position
is
necessary
for
you
to
prevail
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
of
course,
i
suppose
that's
the
penalty
for
engaging
in
worldwide
conspiracy.
justice
stevens
mr.
pate,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
shapiro's
answer
to
my
question
about
a
plaintiff,
an
american
plaintiff
who
has
business
both
in
this
country
and
abroad
and
suffers...
and
both
are
hurt
by
the
conspiracy?
