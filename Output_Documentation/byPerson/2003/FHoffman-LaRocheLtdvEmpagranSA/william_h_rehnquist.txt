chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
03-724,
hoffman-laroche
v.
empagran
s.a.--
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did...
did
the
court
of
appeals
explain
how
that
issue
would
be
litigated
or
decided
whether
someone
else
had
a
claim?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how...
but
how...
how
do
we
know
those
two
factors?
how
do
we
know
what's
consistent
with
international
law?
how
do
we
know
what's
consistent
with
not
antagonizing
our
allies?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
surely
there...
there
are
other
partners
who
have
not
been
heard
from.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
pate,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pate.
mr.
goldstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
goldstein,
do
you
agree
with
the
position
of
your
opponents
that
the
ftaia
was
a
limiting
statute
and
that
if
there
was
no
claim
before
ftaia,
that
there
certainly
is
none
afterwards
for
your
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
pfizer
was
doing
business
in
this
country.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
have...
you
not
only
accept
it,
it's
a
fact,
so
you're--
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're...
you're
talking
about
ftaia?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
court
of
appeals
relied
very
heavily
on
the
act.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
just
did.
i
mean,
not
did--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--good
to
know.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the...
i...
the
court
of
appeals,
i
thought,
said
the
language,
give
rise
to
a
claim,
meant
that
you
didn't
have
to
show
the
claim
of
any
particular
person.
do...
do
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that...
that
in
itself
is
a
rather
elaborate
inquiry
that
you
find
nowhere
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
forum
non
conveniens
is
ordinarily
not
that
you
have
different
law,
but
there
are
other
factors
that
make
it
inconvenient
to
try
the
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
she's
perfectly
capable
of
speaking
her
own
view.
if
you'd
just
answer
your...
my
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but...
but
the
people
from
canada
cannot
go
somewhere
else
and
vindicate
their
claim
because
the
canadian
law
is
different.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i...
i
thought
your
answer
was
that
the
ones
that
don't
can
sue
here,
and
the
ones
that
do
can't
sue
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then
you
said
a
moment
ago,
i
thought,
that
the
canadians
could
sue
here,
but
i...
now
you're
saying
they'd
be
turned
away.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
now,
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
03-724,
f.
hoffman-la
roche
versus
empagran
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
