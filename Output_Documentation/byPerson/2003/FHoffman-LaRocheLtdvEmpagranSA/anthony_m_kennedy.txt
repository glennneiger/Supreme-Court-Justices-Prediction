justice
kennedy
the...
the
respondent
says
in...
in
its
brief
without
much
detail,
just
makes
the
allegation,
well,
it's
the
single
market,
this
is
the
nation,
this
is
a
global
market,
so
there's
nothing
you
can
do.
it...
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
would
be
difficulties
in...
in
defining
what
is
the
foreign
commerce
affecting
the
united
states
and
what
is
foreign
commerce
that
does
not.
how
is
this
resolved
in
your...
best
resolved
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
i...
i
guess
my
point
is,
is
it...
is
it
all
that
clear
in
the
real
world
that
these
are
discrete
concepts?
justice
kennedy
well,
in
my
hypothetical
it
is
his
injury,
he
does
business
both
in
the
united
states
and
in
europe.
justice
kennedy
but
how...
how
is
it,
in...
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
breyer
posed,
that
comity
is
built
in?
if
they...
simply
because
someone
says
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
is.
i...
i
just
don't
see
how
it
is.
justice
kennedy
but...
but
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
the
rule
you're
advocating...
you
say
that
don't...
don't
worry
about
the
other
case,
because
your
case
is
okay.
but
we
are
worried
about
the
other
case.
justice
kennedy
and
i'm
waiting
for
that
rule.
justice
kennedy
it's
still
on
the
table.
