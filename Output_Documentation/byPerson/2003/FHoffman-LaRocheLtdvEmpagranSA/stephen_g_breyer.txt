justice
breyer
the
ftaia
was
passed
in
1982,
is
that
right?
justice
breyer
the
division
keeps
track,
i
guess,
but
is
there
any
instance,
or
what
instances
are
there,
i'd
like
to
write
them
down
unless
there
are
dozens,
in
which
a
foreign
cartel
injures
the
united
states
and
also
separately
injures
people
abroad.
what
instances
were
there
in
which
the
people
in
uruguay
or
wherever
could
sue
the
perpetrators
in
holland
in
an
american
court
prior
to
1982?
justice
breyer
no
such
instance.
i'll
ask
the
other
side
the
same
question.
justice
breyer
so
you've
looked
it
up
and
you
can
find
nothing
in
your
opinion
that
counts
as
such
an
instance?
justice
breyer
no,
no,
i
mean,
their
argument
i
take
it
is
simply,
of
course,
there...
the
quinine
cartel,
which
i
had
heard
of,
i'd
not
heard,
the
quinine
cartel
sets
in
holland
and
raises
the
price
of
quinine
that's
sold
all
over
the
world,
and
of
course
it
violates
our
law
and
we're
out
there
and
they're
lobbing
these
shells
at
us
in
a
sense,
and
so
of
course
we
can
bring
a
claim
against
them,
it
hurts
us.
but
other
countries
have
different
laws,
and
as
far
as
they're
concerned,
those
laws...
what
they
are
doing
in
holland
is
fine.
and
so
what
business
do
we
have
telling
uruguay,
which
thinks
depression
cartels,
or
japan,
which
thinks
oppression
cartels
are
the
greatest
thing,
and
they
may
be,
and
so
does
holland
think
that.
and
what
business
do
we
have
saying
that
a
citizen
of
japan
who's
hurt
by
something
that
the
japanese
think
is
just
fine
and
the
dutch
think
is
just
fine
come
to
our
court
and
enforce
our
law
against
those
other
countries
where
it
doesn't
affect
us?
that's
their
claim.
it's
a
kind
of
like
we're
engaged
in
legal
imperialism.
if
we
think
our
law
is
better,
convince
them.
don't
apply
our
law
to
them
against
their
consent.
now,
that,
i
take
it,
is
the
argument,
not
what
the
prosecution
says.
so
i'd
be
interested
in
your
response.
justice
breyer
it
says
it's
illegal,
period.
justice
breyer
but
i...
if
you're
on
a...
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
a
verbal
point,
which
i'm
not
against.
of
course
we
say
it
is
illegal
what
they
do
in
holland.
it's
illegal
when
they
hurt
us,
it's
illegal
when
we
hurt
them,
we
think
it's
illegal
plain
and
simple.
i
accept
that.
but
what
i
don't
see
follows
from
that
is
that
we
give
a
claim
for
damages
by
a...
to
person
in
uruguay
for
activity
that
takes
place
in
holland,
which
we
think
is
illegal,
but
the
dutch
and
the
uruguayans
don't.
and
so
i
can't
get
mileage
for
you
unless
i'm
wrong
in
thinking
that
out
of
words
in
indictments
that
say
american
tobacco,
what
they
did
was
illegal
everywhere.
i
like...
i
think
the
antitrust
laws
are
a
marvelous
policy,
okay,
so
i'm
tempted
to
say,
yes,
it's
illegal
everywhere.
but
that
isn't
where
i'm
having
the
problem.
i'm
having
the
problem
about
finding...
i...
i'd
be
repeating
myself,
so
have
you
taken
it
in?
justice
breyer
okay,
what's
the
answer?
justice
breyer
correct.
and
if
we
had
that
alone,
that
would
be
strong
support,
and
the
problem
is
we
have
another
sentence,
which
is
the
first
sentence
in
the
ftaia,
whatever
it
is,
and
then
you
get
to
the
second.
justice
breyer
but
all
of
that
is
true
and
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
we
do
or
should
permit
a
cause
of
action.
justice
breyer
i...
i
just
want...
don't
want
you
to
lose
part
3,
and
let...
let
you
focus
on
that,
the
comity.
justice
breyer
one
possibility
floating
through
my
mind
is
that
there
are
international
quinine
or
maybe
this,
international
vitamin
cartels,
where
it's
pure
price-fixing,
and
in
such
instances,
prices
in
one
country
may
be
interdependent
on
another,
and
in
such
instances
if
you
lose
this
case
here,
now,
you
may
still
have
a
claim,
because
it
flows
in
part,
the
injury,
from
effects
in
the
united
states.
but
there
are
many
other
parts
of
the
antitrust
law
which
are
highly
controversial.
to
name
a
few,
information
sharing,
vertical
restrictions
of
different
kinds.
and
if
you
win
here,
not
only
do
you
not
have
to
show
this
interdependent
thing,
but
anybody
could
come
in
under
all
those
under
provisions
too,
which
many
other
countries
don't
like
at
all,
and
bring
lawsuits
and
there's
no
way
to
prevent
our
law
from
becoming
generally
imperialistic
in
this
sense
that
i've
been
talking
about.
that's
a
way
of
focusing
you
back
on
the
comity
question,
and
you
can
answer
mine,
the
comity,
whatever
you
like.
justice
breyer
i
don't
really
see
what
it's
doing
on
the
table.
i
mean,
it
didn't
require
a
nobel
prize
winner
to
make
me
figure
out
that
in
fact
the
worse
you
treat
the
people
who
make
the
cartel,
the
less
likely
they
are
to
do
it.
but
i
mean,
fine,
you're
right,
if
you
hung
and
quartered
them
or
whatever,
they'd
do
it
even
less.
but
what...
what
is
that
to
do
with
the
price
of
fish,
so
to
speak?
justice
breyer
so
you
have
flushed
them
all
out
that
way.
now,
the
ones
you
have
left,
which
is
yours
which
you
like,
why
can't
you
bring...
fit
right
within
the
language
here
that
where
this
worldwide
market
is
in
fact
such
that
its
price
in
bolivia
is
never
going
to
hold
up
unless
the
price
in
the
united
states
holds
up
if
you've
got
the
necessary
causal
relationship
to
effects
in
the
united
states.
that's
the
second
half
which
you
said
we
should
remand.
i
mean,
maybe
that's
a
good
half.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
vitamin
distributors
from
ecuador,
panama,
australia,
and
the
ukraine.
they
claim
that
vitamin
manufacturers,
many
of
whom
make
vitamins
in
europe,
formed
a
worldwide
conspiracy
to
raise
the
price
of
vitamins.
the
legal
question
before
us
is
whether
those
foreign
distributors,
the
plaintiffs,
who
bought
their
vitamins
abroad,
can
bring
a
sherman
act
antitrust
suit
in
the
united
states
against
the
manufacturers
complaining
of
their
injury,
which
is
a
wholly
foreign
injury.
the
relevant
statute,
which
is
called
the
foreign
trade
antitrust
improvements
act
of
1982,
says
that
the
sherman
act,
the
basic
antitrust
statute,
“shall
not
apply
to
conduct
involving
trade
or
commerce
with
foreign
nations.”
a
phrase
that,
in
our
view,
fits
this
case
and
that
would
seem
to
be
the
end
of
it.
but,
the
act
also
creates
an
exception
and
in
particular,
an
exception
for
foreign-related
anticompetitive
conduct
that
creates
a
significant
domestic
harm.
the
vitamin
buyers
say
that
the
manufacturers'
conduct
falls
within
this
exception
because
the
conduct
did
create
significant
domestic
harm
in
the
united
states,
as
well
as
creating
the
harm
that
hurt
them,
say,
in
ecuador,
and
for
that
reason,
they
say
they
should
be
allowed
to
sue
under
the
sherman
act.
we
do
not
think
that
the
distributors'
argument
is
good
enough.
that
is
because
we
have
to
assume
for
present
purposes
that
the
foreign
harm,
namely
higher
prices
in,
say,
ecuador,
is
completely
independent
of
the
domestic
harm,
i.e.
higher
prices
in
the
united
states.
and
because
of
that
independence,
we
think
that
the
distributors'
claim
cannot
fall
within
the
exception.
otherwise,
were
we
to
accept
their
argument,
the
sherman
act
would
apply
to
totally
foreign
activity
that
produced
almost
totally
foreign
harm
unreasonably
interfering
with
the
rights
of
foreign
nations
to
decide
how
they
want
to
regulate
commercial
conduct
within
their
boarders.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
statute
or
in
its
history
that
congress
intended
to
bring
about
any
such
result.
for
these
and
for
other
reasons,
we
hold
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
apply
where
the
harm
at
issue
is
foreign
and
independent
of
domestic
harm.
we
reverse
a
contrary
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
remand
the
case
so
that
the
plaintiffs
may
raise
a
related
but
different
claim,
namely
that
the
foreign
harm
was
not
independent
of
the
domestic
harm
but
they
were
interdependent
that
was
not
before
us.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
justice
o’connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
