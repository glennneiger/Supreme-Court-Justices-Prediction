mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
given
the
key
role
of
deterrence,
both
in
the
opinion
below
and
in
the
respondents'
arguments
here,
the
united
states
thinks
it
important
to
offer
the
court
an
accurate
understanding
of
how
international
cartel
enforcement
really
works.
it's
only
in
the
past
8
years
that
we've
begun
to
see
dramatic
success
in
detecting
and
punishing
international
cartels,
and
that
has
come
about
only
by
international
cooperation
with
other
enforcement
agencies
and
through
the
use
of
amnesty
programs.
there's
nothing
in
the
ftaia,
much
less
any
clear
congressional
statement,
in
statute
that
after
all
was
jurisdiction-limiting
in
intent,
that
would
require
jeopardizing
our
progress
in
those
enforcement
efforts
through
a
dramatic
extraterritorial
application
of
u.s.
treble
damages
litigation.
even
if
there
were,
established
principles
of
standing
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
would
nonetheless
preclude
that
result.
mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
the...
the
important
point,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
under
these
amnesty
programs,
there
is
no
amnesty
given
for
civil
liability.
so
it
is
our
experience
that
when
a
company
finds
that
its
employees
have
been
engaged
in
wrongdoing,
it
balances
the
potential
for
freedom
from
criminal
liability
against
the
certainty
that
civil
treble
damages
will
follow.
and
to
make
the
type
of
sea
change
in
the
law
that's
advocated
by
respondents
here
to
provide
for
unquantifiable,
potentially
unknowable
worldwide
liability
will
in
our
judgment
lead
to
the
risk
that
companies
who
discover
this
type
of
conduct
will
instead
hunker
down
and
simply
hope
not
to
be
detected.
the...
the
effect
will
be
even
more
dramatic
with
respect
to
the
amnesty
programs
of
some
of
our
trading
partners,
such
as
the
countries
who
have
filed
briefs
here,
because
in
those
systems,
treble
damages
are
simply
unknown.
so
while
we
fear
a
marginal
decrease
in
the
effectiveness
of
our
program,
there
would
be
a
dramatic
impact
on
foreign
amnesty
programs--
mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
--yes,
justice
stevens,
i
do,
because
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
his
own
injury
is,
by
reason
of--
mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
--exactly.
but
with
respect
to
the
foreign
incurred
injuries,
he
must
show
injury
by
reason
of
that
which
makes
the
conduct
illegal,
and
since
alcoa
in
1954,
and
certainly
under
hartford,
it
is
the
effect
on
u.s.
commerce
that
makes
the
conduct
the
concern
of
the
sherman
act
in
the
first
place
so
that
he
cannot
show
that
he's
been
injured
by
reason
of
that
which
makes
the
conduct
illegal.
mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
hartford--
mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
--that's
correct,
justice
souter.
the
court
did
not
address
the
statute.
i
was
simply
pointing
out
that
in
foreign
commerce
cases,
it
is
the
effect
on
u.s.
commerce
rather
than
the
conduct
itself
that
causes
that
conduct
to
be
the
concern
of
u.s.
antitrust
laws.
absent
the
effect
on
u.s.
commerce,
there
would
be
no
application
of
the
u.s.
antitrust
laws.
that's
true
under
alcoa
and
true
under
hartford.
now,
with
respect
to
the
ftaia,
we
think
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
statute
is
simply
that
the
court
look
at
the
party
bringing
the
claim
before
the
court
in
construing
section
(a)(2).
mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
we're
aware
of
no
instance
of
such
a
case
and
it--
mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
--it
was
clear
and
it
is
accepted
as
a
commonplace
that
a
plaintiff
who
did
not
participate
in
u.s.
commerce,
in
trading
in
u.s.
commerce,
simply
would
not
have
had
the
same--
mr.
r.
hewitt
pate,
iii
--we're
aware
of
no
such
case.
the
respondents
have
attempted
to
cite
district
court
cases,
but
if
you
look
at
each
of
those,
you
will
find
an
effect
on
u.s.
commerce,
and
with
respect
to
the
industria
siciliana
case
mentioned
in
their
brief,
you'll
find
that
that
was
a
case
that
was
expressly
disapproved
by
the
congress
when
it
passed
the
ftaia,
even
if
it
could
be
read
that
way,
so
that
under
the
ftaia,
we
think
the
natural
reading
is
simply
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
claim
before
it
and
to
ask
whether
the
u.s.
effect
gives
rise
to
a
claim
on
behalf
of
the
party
in
court.
where
the
united
states
is
bringing
a
claim,
any
time
we
can
meet
the
direct,
the
effects
test
of
hartford
and
alcoa,
we
will
always
have
a
claim
that
has
arisen
from
a
u.s.
effect,
so
that
there
is
no
danger
here
to
u.s.
enforcement,
which
continues
under
the
application
of
the
ftaia
without
any
burden.
but
as
to
a
private
plaintiff,
the
private
plaintiff
must
show
that
its
own
claim
is
one
that
has
been
given
rise
to
by
a
u.s.
effect.
turning
to
standing,
we
think
even
if
the
ftaia
did
not
apply,
that
the
proper
result
here
would
nonetheless
be
reached
under
the
clayton
act,
not
only
for
the...
by
reason
of
rationale
that
justice
stevens
mentioned
in
his
question,
but
also
because
the
plaintiffs
are
not
within
the
zone
of
interests
that
are
protected
by
the
antitrust
laws
under
this
court's
opinion
in
matsushita
and
elsewhere,
which
makes
clear
that
our
sherman
act
is
not
intended
to
set
the
competitive
conditions
for
other
nations'
economies.
and
finally,
if
the
court
simply
were
to
apply
the
remoteness
or
proximate
cause
rationale
that's
also
very
prevalent
in
the
court's
antitrust
standing
cases,
which
excludes
injuries,
for
example,
to
shareholders,
to
employees,
that
the
case
also
would
not
be
proper
under
a
remoteness
rationale,
because
these
plaintiffs
do
not
in
fact
allege
that
they
were
the
victims
of
an
overcharge
in
u.s.
commerce.
they
do
not
even
allege,
justice
ginsburg,
that
they
made
any
attempt
to
purchase
in
u.s.
commerce,
but
would
rather
seek
to
use
speculative
transactions
that
never
occurred
to
make
an
end
run
around
the
ftaia
by
defining
a
so-called
one-world
market
or
one
big
conspiracy
theory.
to
do
that
would
certainly
again
be
completely
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
in
matsushita,
where
the
japanese
aspects
of
a
conspiracy
were
sought
to
be
put
together
with
american
aspects
into
one
big
claim.
the
court
plainly
rejected
that.
indeed,
if
we
were
to
proceed
on
that
theory,
why
would
not
the
claim
here
be
equally
seen
to
have
been
given
rise
to
by
effects
in
france,
effects
in
great
britain,
russia,
or
elsewhere.
there
is
simply
no
limiting
principle.
and
as
mr.
shapiro
suggests,
to
pursue
this
path
would
embroil
the
district
courts
around
the
country
in
all
forms
of
satellite
litigation,
and
it's
very
important
to
recognize
that
this
is
not
a
test
that
would
apply
only
to
a
notorious
worldwide
criminal
conspiracy,
such
as
was
at
issue
here,
but
would
apply
to
rule
of
reason
cases,
joint
venture
cases,
could
apply
even
to
section
2
cases
under
the
sherman
act
any
time
a
plaintiff
was
able
to
allege
that
some
other
plaintiff
somewhere
suffered
from
a
u.s.
effect
that
was
related
to
that
conduct.
and
the
cases
that
mr.
shapiro
mentioned
are
good
indications
of
that.
so
in
our
judgment,
the
court
should
pay
attention
to
the
practical
realities
of
enforcement
and
avoid
doing
damage
to
them,
avoid
creating
friction
with
our
trading
partners
in
a
situation
where
whatever
else
can
be
said,
there
is
no
clear
congressional
statement
that
the
ftaia
should
be
read
to
expand
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
the
statute
cannot
on
its
terms
expand
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
its
language,
which
begins
with
a
statement
that
the
antitrust
laws
shall
not
apply,
and
then
puts
the
plaintiff
back
where
it
was
prior
to
the
ftaia
if
certain
conditions
are
met.
in
no
case
can
the
statute
operate
to
give
additional
causes
of
action
or
create
additional
standing
on
behalf
of
parties
who
didn't
have
it
prior
to
the
ftaia.
in
short,
all
the
court
need
do
is
evaluate
respondents'
own
claim
rather
than
the
hypothetical
claims
of
others,
and
doing
so
will
require
dismissal.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
