mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states,
joined
by
seven
other
nations,
has
concluded
that
the
decision
in
this
case
is
an
error
and
should
be
reversed.
the
reason
is
that
the
plaintiffs
here
are
foreign
claimants
which
allege
that
they
paid
too
much
for
vitamins
outside
of
u.s.
commerce.
trying
these
claims
in
our
courts
would
conflict
with
the
principle
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
regulate
the
competitive
conditions
of
other
nations'
economies,
and
stretching
the
antitrust
laws
to
include
such
claims
is
a
recipe
for
international
discord
and
for
heavy
new
burdens
on
our
federal
district
courts.
now,
when
congress
passed
the
ftaia
in
1982,
it
did
not
expand
the
domain
of
the
antitrust
laws,
but
rather
clarified
limitations.
it
required
both
an
effect
on
u.s.
commerce
and
the
claim
arising
from
that
same
effect.
as
the
government
explains,
this
is
language
that
refers
most
naturally
to
a
claim
of
the
plaintiff
before
the
court,
and
not
a
claim
of
some
other
person.
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
believed
that
it
was
enough
for
somebody
else
to
have
a
claim
arising
from
a
u.s.
effect.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
really
had...
had
no
explanation
of
that,
your
honor,
and
it's
quite
an
extraordinary
assumption
that
you
would
inquire
into
the
bona
fides
of
some
unknown
person
whether
they
have
a
claim
or
not,
and
indeed,
there
is
a
case
pending
before
this
court,
the
sniado
case,
where
the
litigants
have
no
idea
whether
there's
another
person
who
has
such
a
claim
in
the
united
states,
and
yet
discovery
has
to
take
place
on
that...
that
issue.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
in
our
opinion,
the
characterization
of
the
market
and
the
scope
of
the
conspiracy
is
irrelevant
to
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws.
their...
their
domain
is
defined
in
terms
of
the
commerce
of
the
united
states.
both
the
sherman
act
explicitly
says
commerce
within
the
united
states,
among
our
states,
and
with
foreign
nations.
the
ftaia
refers
to
our
commerce
too.
there
was
no
indication
that
congress
was
attempting
to
regulate
commerce
in
other
nations
or
between
other
nations
with
this
extraordinary
remedy
of
treble
damages.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
congress
had
in
mind
that...
that
this
would
be
a
bright
line
test
whether
or
not
our
commerce
was
injured,
defined
as
commerce
that's
domestic
or
import
or
export,
and
it
distinguished
that
from
wholly
foreign
transactions,
wholly
foreign
commerce,
and
it
wanted
to
draw
that
line
so
that
these
cases
would
be
allocated
to
the
correct
judicial
system
in
the
world
community
and
they
would
not
all
be--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it...
it
makes
out
an
injury
to
wholly
foreign
commerce.
the
overcharge
took
place
in
australia,
ecuador,
panama,
and
the
ukraine,
and
it
isn't
enough
to
say
there's
some
interrelationship
among
these
prices.
the
fifth
circuit
correctly
rejected
that
claim
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
right.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
at
all--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--all
of
the
people
who
were
overcharged
in
the
united
states
have
been
compensated
in
the
settlement
and
our
fines
here
have
been
geared
to
the
overcharge--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
your
honor,
if...
if
the
ftaia
was
interpreted
to
permit
that
argument,
the
consequences,
all
of
the
foreign
claimants
could
come
to
our
courts,
our
courts
would
be
flooded,
other
nations
would
be
antagonized,
because
they
believe
that
they
should
be
able
to
apply
their
law
to
those
foreign
transactions.
it
isn't
enough
to
speculate
about
relationships
among
prices
in
these
two
systems,
because
the
statute
requires
a
line
to
be
drawn
between
effect
in
the
united
states--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
effects,
purely
foreign
commerce.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
only
for
injury
in
the
united
states,
and
the
house
report
talks
about
that,
companies
that
are
involved
in
jurisdictions--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes,
i...
i
do,
because
the...
the
clayton
act
limits
the
private
treble
damage
action
to
injuries
stemming
from
a
restraint
on
u.s.
commerce,
commerce
among
the
states,
and
with
foreign
nations,
not
foreign
commerce
that
is
wholly
in
foreign
nations
or
between
foreign
nations.
the
injury
has
to
flow
from
that
which
makes
the
conduct
illegal,
which
is
the
u.s.
restraint.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
because
if...
if
the...
if
the
united
states
claimant
has
participated
overseas
in
purely
foreign
commerce,
congress
expected
that
that
plaintiff
would
invoke
the
laws
of
the
other
nation.
to
the
extent
that
it
participated
in
u.s.
commerce,
congress
expected
that
the
plaintiff
would
come
to
our
courts.
it
was
a
division
of
judicial
labors
among
the
sovereign
nations
to
try
to
encourage
other
nations
to
adopt
their
own
antitrust
laws
and
to
avoid
the
kind
of
antagonism
that
we
see
with
these
amicus
briefs
from
other
countries.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well...
well,
of
course
not,
your
honor,
because
the
plaintiffs
here...
we're
talking
about
the
winddridge
pig
farm
in...
in...
as
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
australia
that's
claiming
it
paid
too
much
for
vitamins
in
australia,
and
the
other
countries
wonder
why...
why
are
they
complaining
about
the
price
of
vitamins
in
the
united
states
court?
it's
a
purely
foreign
transaction--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
your
honor,
first,
the
complaint
does
not
allege
any
attempt
to
deal
in
the
united
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there...
there
is
one
case
that
i
would
refer
your
honor
to.
it's
the
amex
v.
montreal
trading
case,
1981
decision
from
the
tenth
circuit
that
says
it's
not
enough
to
say
we
might
have
done
something
different,
we
could
have
done
something
different,
we
wish
we
had
done
something
different.
there
has
to
be
a
trading
pattern.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
there
had
to
be
an
interrupted
course
of
trading
before
a
plaintiff
could
make
that
allegation,
and
that's
very
similar
to
what
this
court
held
in
holmes
v.
sipc--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
shapiro,
i--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
you
have
to
have
an
actual
transaction
that's
been
interrupted.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
yes,
we
do
rely
on
the
second
prong
of
the
ftaia,
which
requires
that
the
particular
claim
derive
from
an
anti-competitive
effect
in
the
u.s.
and
here
it
doesn't,
it
derives
from
an
effect
overseas,
and
of
course,
these
plaintiffs
don't
allege
that
they
purchased
some
export
coming
from
the
united
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
certainly
would
be,
and
it
would
be
extremely
speculative,
and
it's
the
sort
of
claim
this
court
has
always
rejected
under
holmes
against
sipc,
under
blue
chip
stamps,
in
the
securities
context,
which
has
been
followed
the
antitrust
case
law.
it's
not
enough
to
say
we
might
have
done
something
different.
that
does
not
make
them
into
participants
in
u.s.
commerce,
and
congress
wanted
the
treble
damage
remedy
to
be
available
to
protect
our
commerce.
it
expected
other
countries
to
adopt
their
own
laws
to
deal
with
overcharges
within
their
own
territories,
and
other
nations,
of
course,
have
done
just
that.
they've
passed
over
100
different
pieces
of
legislation
all
around
the
world,
from
albania
to
zambia,
we
see
new
antitrust
laws
that
have
been
passed,
and
it
would
discourage
that
process
if
the
u.s.
courts
attempted
to
subsume
all
of
these
foreign
overcharge
disputes
into
our
court
system.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
is
a
kind
of
comity
that
justice
scalia
referred
to
in
the
hartford
case
that
we
think
is
raised
here,
and
that
is
comity
bearing...
comity
among
nations,
not
judicial
comity
where
the
judges
weigh
various
and
sundry
factors,
but
it's
a
rule
of
interpretation
that...
that
discourages
interpretations
of
law,
where
you
have
two
interpretations
that
are
available,
you
pick
the
interpretation
that
is
most
consistent
with
international
law
and
which
avoids
antagonizing
our
allies
and
our
trading
partners.
and
that
concept
is
very
much
before
the
court
here,
and
i
think
it
argues
very
much
in
favor
of
the
narrower
interpretation,
particularly
because
congress
was
expecting
that
wholly
foreign
transactions,
that's
the
term
used
in
the
house
report,
would
be
litigated
in
foreign
nations,
and...
and
our...
our
allies
and
trading
partners--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
yes,
we...
we
think
the
literal
language
and
the
structure
of
the
statute
are
sufficient
to
reverse
here.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
court's
endowed,
it's
very
appropriate
to
use
these
traditional
tools
of
interpretation
that
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
charming
betsy
case
that
the
court,
faced
with
a
choice
between
two
readings
of
a
statute,
picks
the
interpretation
that
is
compatible
with
international
law
and
which
avoids
antagonizing
our
allies.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
on
the
latter,
we
have
amicus
briefs
from
seven
of
our...
our
most
significant
trading
partners,
of
allies--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
true,
but
all
of
the
foreign
nations
that
have
spoken
up
here
agree
with
the
united
states
that
this
is
contrary
to
their
ability
to
regulate
commerce
in
their
own
nations.
no
nation--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--absolutely.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
are
100
nations
now
that
do
have
aggressive
antitrust
enforcement
programs,
and
congress'
view
in
1982
was
that
we
should
draw
back
in
our
attempt
to
police
the
world
because
we
want
all
these
other
nations
to
adopt
these
rules.
that
won't
happen
if
the
united
states
takes
all
of
these
cases
into
its
jurisdiction.
other
nations
won't
go
the
route
that
they...
that
they
were
encouraged
to
do
by
congress.
and
i
think
it's
also
important
to
consider
the
burden
on
our
judicial
system
that
the
interpretation
advocated
by
my
friends
would
impose.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
it...
these
cases
are
difficult
to
administer
under
the
best
of
circumstances,
but
consider
global
plaintiffs
from
192
countries
coming
to
the
united
states
and
asking
a
single
district
court
judge
to
decide
how
much
they've
been
overcharged,
how
much
competition
there
was
locally,
what
trade
barriers
there
were
that
might
have
prevented
competition,
calculate
the
damages
for
every
man,
woman,
and
child
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
perhaps
is...
has
an
antitrust
claim.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
that
penalty
is
imposed
on
our
district
court
judges.
they
would...
would
be
forced
to
untangle
these
incredibly
different
procedural
problems,
and
how
are
they
going
to
give
notice
to
people
around
the
globe
in
192
languages
with
different
dialects?
how
could
we
even
accomplish
that
and
how
could
we
make
sure
people
are
actually
protected
in
this
global
forum
that's
being
advocated?
u.s.
courts
are
not
world
courts
equipped
to
do
this.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
plaintiffs
here
are...
are
alleging
a
class
action
of
all
the
purchasers
around
the
world
outside
of
the
united
states,
and
every
one
of
the
cases
that's
been
filed
under
this
theory
has
been
a
class
action,
so
that's...
that's
what
we're
seeing.
and
of
course,
in...
in
a
broad
array
of
future
cases,
not
just
price-fixing
cases,
but
all
sherman
act
cases
are
subject
to
this
ftaia
regime--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
don't
think
the
class
issue
has
been
reached
in
any
of
these
cases,
but
they...
they
are
being
filed.
i...
i
saw
one
just
a
month
ago
in
the
district
court
in
connecticut.
it
was
a
suit
by
an
indian
dealership
alleging
it
had
been
wrongfully
terminated
in
india.
he
wanted
to
litigate
in
our
courts
over
the
propriety
of
that
termination,
claiming
that
dealers
in
the
united
states
maybe
were
affected
by
the
same
thing.
well,
there
are
lots
of
dealerships
around
the
world
in
192
countries,
and
the
lure
of
treble
damages
is
a
powerful
lure
that's
going
to
bring
them
to
our
country
if
these
claims
are
accepted.
with
the
court's
permission,
we
would
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
of
appeals
and
mr.
goldstein
have
relied
on
the
deterrence
concept
here,
but
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
government,
supported
by
seven
of
our
allies
and
trading
partners,
has
said
that
this
position
is
going
to
undermine
deterrence.
why?
because
it's
going
to
reduce
the
detection
of
international
price-fixing
cartels,
and
you
get
zero
deterrence
if
you
don't
have
actual
detection
of
overseas
cartel
behavior.
the
key
to
getting
the
detection
is
the
amnesty
program
and
international
cooperation
with
our
allies,
and
right
now,
our
allies
are
shrinking
away
from
the
united
states,
information-sharing
agreements
that
are
needed
here
to
investigate
and
prosecute
cartels.
the
justice
department
officials
have
been
giving
speeches
about
that
bad
effect,
so
there's
a
very
serious
danger
of
undermining
deterrence
here
if
this
position
is
accepted.
now,
on
comity
of
nations,
that
is
not
a
judicial
balancing
of
one
factor
and
another
equitable
factor.
that's
a
rule
of
statutory
interpretation
that
this
court
has
applied
ever
since
the
charming
betsy
case
200
years
ago,
and
what
it
means
is
that
if
a
particular
alternative
is
presented
that
broadly
construes
our
laws
to
intrude
into
the
affairs
of
other
nations
and
cause
friction,
that
interpretation
is
going
to
be
rejected,
and
that
was
certainly
not
rejected
in
the
hartford
case.
professor
areta,
in
his
treatise,
pointed
out
that
our
antitrust
laws
do
not
rule
the
entire
commercial
world,
and
that's
a
concept
that's
written
right
into
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
it
applies
to...
its
domain
is
commerce
among
the
states
and
commerce
with
foreign
nations,
not
commerce
within
foreign
nations,
not
commerce
between
foreign
nations.
and
the
reason
the
ftaia
drew
the
sharp
lines
that
it
did
is
the
reason
that
justice
breyer
was
driving
at.
other
nations
have
their
own
policies.
they
disapproved
treble
damages.
they
have
their
own
procedures
for
dealing
with
antitrust
issues
instead
of
per
se
rules
and
rules
of
reason,
they
have
prohibitions
and
then
a
series
of
exemptions
applied
by
expert
administrators.
so
if
our
courts
take
these
issues
over
and
apply
treble
damages
remedies,
they
override
procedure,
they
override
the...
the
substance
of
these
laws,
and...
and
they
are
certainly
going
to
override
policies
against
treble
damages,
which
have
provoked
huge
international
discord
in
the
form
of
claw-back
statutes,
blocking
statutes.
our
closest
allies
have
responded
to
overreaching
that
way,
and
congress
wanted
to
minimize
that
problem
with
passage
of
the
statute.
now,
the
timken
case
that
counsel
referred
to
was
a
case
where
the
government
was
going
after
contracts
overseas
that
injured
our
commerce.
the
government
was
not
going
after
practices
overseas
that
had
effects
overseas
and
not
here.
counsel
referred
to
the
weight
of
scholarship.
i
read
all
those
articles.
there's
only
one
of
them
that
suggests
that
everybody
in
the
world
can
come
trooping
into
our
courts
if
some
person
here
has
an
antitrust
claim
from
two
private
practitioners
who
had
no
background
in
the
government.
they
simply
asserted
that
without
any
analysis.
i
don't
think
that
constitutes
weighty
scholarship.
now,
the
national
bank
of
canada
case
that
counsel
referred
to,
if
in
fact
that's
the
case
that
congress
meant
to
approve,
that
means
they're
out
of
court,
because
that's
a
case
where
the
complaint
was
dismissed
because
the
injury
was
felt
in
canada
and
was
not
felt
in
the
united
states,
and
the
second
circuit
dismissed
that
claim
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
on
this
worldwide
market
point,
the...
the
statutes
here
hinge
jurisdiction
on
commerce.
lawyers
can
always
draw
a
global
conspiracy.
economists
can
always
say
there's
a
global
market,
and
these
issues
would
be
enormous
quagmires
for
the
district
courts
if
that's
what
our
courts'
jurisdiction
turned
on.
congress
did
not
intend
that.
it
intended
a
clear
jurisdictional
benchmark
by
focusing
on
our
commerce.
there
has
to
be
an
injury
to
our
commerce
and
the
plaintiff
before
the
court
has
to
be
alleging
treble
damages
based
on
that
particular
injury.
in...
in
light
of
these
considerations,
the
justice
department's
position,
the
position
of
our
allies,
who
have
submitted
amicus
briefs,
we
submit
that
this
decision
is
an
error
and
it
should
be
reversed
and
i
thank
the
court.
