but
less
in...
less
in
row
15
than
in
row
48.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
addition,
there
were
the
no-revenue
people
who
could
have
been
asked
to
leave.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
is
this
a
pure
omission?
it
seems
to
me
she
misrepresented
that
the
plane
was
full
twice
when
that
wasn't
true.
that
doesn't
sound
like
an
omission
to
me.
she
told
the
wife
to
sit
down.
she...
well,
how
do
you
treat
that
she
was
supposed
to
report
such
incidents
to
her
supervisor
and
she
didn't
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
part
of
the
picture
is
things
that
she
affirmatively
did
do,
and
part
are
things
she
didn't
do.
and
i
don't
understand
that
the
law
makes
a
distinction
between
doing
what
one
should
not
have
done
or
not
doing
what
one
should
have
done.
justice
ginsburg
how
about
other
courts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
we
do
look
to
see
what
our
treaty
partners
do
in
this
area.
the
two
other
courts
that
were
cited
in
the
brief
that
addressed
this
question
seem
to
agree
with
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
court
of
appeals
in
england...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
disagreed
on
the...
on
the...
whatever
that...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
disagreed
on
that,
but
did
say,
went
out
of
its
way
to
say,
it
thought
that
this
case
was
the
right
way
to
go
about
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
so,
having
read
his
decision
and
the
other
members
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she...
she
said
positively
there
are
no
empty
seats.
the...
the
option
that
was
given
to
the
wife
was
that
you
go
ask
another
passenger
to
switch
seats.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
by
the
time
the
second
and
third
inquiries
were
asked,
it
should
have
been
evident
that
there
were
empty
seats.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
tseng
had
held
nothing
on
this
point,
in
fact,
it...
it
said
that
the
second
circuit's
conclusion
that
that
wasn't
an
accident
was
doubtful.
in
tseng,
it
was
an
academic
question.
what
barred
her
from
getting
recovery
under
the
treaty
was
she
didn't
suffer
from
a
physical
injury
or
from
a
psychological
injury
with...
with
physical
manifestations.
she
didn't
die
and
she
didn't
have
the
kind
of
injury
that
would
qualify.
tseng...
i
think
you
are
quite
wrong
in
saying
that
that
decision
passed
on
the
concept
of
accident.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
do
think
the
eleventh
circuit
krys
case
was
wrong
in
both
reasoning
and
result.
