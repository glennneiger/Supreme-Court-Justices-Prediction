we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-1348,
olympic
airways
v.
rubina
husain.
mr.
harakas.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
there
other
seats
available
in
the
economy
section?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
economy
section?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
you
say
you
have
to
consider
just
very
precisely
what
caused
the
injury.
what
is
your
view
here
of
what
caused
the
injury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
does
that
make...
does
that
make
any
difference
in...
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
his
wife
was
speaking
for
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the...
i
wouldn't
think
they
allowed
smoking
before
takeoff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are...
are
you
saying
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
really
wrote
an
opinion
about...
in
negligence
and
saying
that's
an
accident?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
it
seems
to
me
whatever
you
think
about
what
the
flight
attendant
did,
it...
it
can't
be
classed
as
negligence
here.
it
was
a
refusal
to
do
something.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
harakas.
mr.
farr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your...
you
stated
in
your
opening
that
the
airline's
conduct
here
was
contrary
to
industry
policy,
and
i
think
justice
o'connor
premised
an
earlier
question
on
saying
it
was
against
the
policy
of...
of
this
particular
airline.
spell
that
out
a
little,
will
you?
what
was
the
policy
of...
of
the
airline
and
why
did
this
action
violate
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
the
same.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would...
would
it
have
been
any
more
or
less
of
an
accident
if
that
practice
had
not
prevailed
in
the
industry?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the
airline's
defense
to
throwing
hot
coffee
on
the
passenger
said
our
stewardesses
do
that
all
the
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
unexpected
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
someone
suffered,
say,
a
heart
attack
on
the
plane
and
it
was
3
hours
from
its
destination
and
the
doctor
there
said,
you
know,
you've
really
got
to...
in...
in
order
to
avoid
this
guy
probably
dying,
you're
going
to
have
to
land
somewhere
en
route?
now,
would
an
airline
be
obligated
to
do
that
in
order
to
avoid
this
sort
of
accident?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then...
then
you're
saying
basically
it
depends
on
airline
practice
whether
something
is
expected
or
unexpected
and
whether
it's
the
normal
practice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
ms.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
mcdowell...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does...
how
does
that
differ
from...
from
the
common
law
at
all?
if
you
say
objective
reasonableness,
you're
really
just
changing
accident
into
common
law
negligence,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell.
mr.
harakas,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harakas.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1348,
olympic
airways
versus
husain
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
