justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeal
for
the
ninth
circuit.
while
respondent
and
her
husband
dr.
hanson
were
traveling
overseas,
she
requested
that
petitioner
olympic
airways
assign
them
non
smoking
seats,
because
dr.
hanson
had
asthma
and
was
sensitive
to
secondhand
smoke.
after
boarding
they
discovered
that
their
seats
were
located
only
three
rows
in
front
of
the
smoking
section.
a
flight
attendant
refused
respondent's
three
requests
to
move
dr.
hanson.
about
two
hours
onto
the
flight
the
smoke
noticeably
increased
in
their
section.
dr.
hanson
walked
toward
the
front
of
the
plane
to
get
some
fresh
air.
dr.
hanson
suffered
an
asthma
attack
and
after
receiving
medical
assistance
he
died.
respondent
filed
a
wrongful-death
suit
under
article
17
of
the
warsaw
convention,
and
the
district
court
found
petitioner
liable.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
holding
that
the
flight
attendants
refusal
to
reseat
dr.
hanson
constituted
an
accident
under
article
17,
because
her
conduct
was
both
external
to
dr.
hanson
and
unexpected
and
unusual
in
light
of
industry
standards
and
petitioner’s
policy.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
article
17
an
air
carrier
is
liable
for
a
passenger’s
death
caused
by
an
accident
that
occurred
on
an
international
flight.
in
this
court’s
decision
in
air
france
v.
saks,
the
court
defined
accident
to
mean
an
unexpected
or
unusual
event
or
happening
that
is
external
to
the
passenger,
and
not
the
passenger’s
own
internal
reaction
to
the
usual,
normal
and
expected
operation
of
the
aircraft.
the
court
did
not
suggest
that
only
one
of
that
could
constitute
the
accident,
but
recognized
that
any
injury
is
the
product
of
a
chain
of
causes.
the
court
stated
that
a
plaintiff
need
only
be
able
to
prove
that
some
link
in
the
chain
was
an
unusual
or
unexpected
event
external
to
the
passenger,
the
party’s
dispute;
which
event
should
be
the
focus
of
the
accident
inquiry?
petitioner
argues
that
the
injury
producing
event
was
not
the
flight
attendant’s
conduct,
but
rather
the
presence
of
ambient
cigarette
smoke
in
the
aircraft’s
cabin,
which
is
a
normal
and
expected
part
of
the
operation
of
an
international
aircraft.
petitioner’s
focus
on
the
ambient
cigarette
smoke
is
misplaced,
and
neglects
the
reality
that
there
are
often
multiple
interrelated
factual
events
that
combine
to
cause
any
injury.
in
saks,
the
court
recognized
that
any
one
of
these
factual
events
or
happenings,
maybe
a
link
in
the
chain
of
causes,
and
so
long
as
it
is
unusual
or
unexpected,
it
constitutes
an
accident
under
article
17.
the
flight
attendant’s
refusal
on
three
separate
occasions
to
move
dr.
hanson
was
also
a
factual
event
that
the
district
court
correctly
found
to
be
a
link
in
the
chain
of
causes
that
led
to
dr.
hanson’s
death.
we
also
reject
petitioner’s
argument
that
because
the
flight
attendant’s
failure
to
act
was
not
an
affirmative
act,
it
cannot
constitute
an
accident.
the
relevant
accident
inquiry
under
saks
is
whether
there
is
an
unexpected
or
unusual
event
or
happening.
the
rejection
of
an
explicit
request
for
assistance
would
be
an
event
or
happening
under
the
ordinary
unusual
definitions
of
these
terms.
in
other
provisions
of
the
convention
confirmed
that
there
is
often
no
distinction
between
action
and
inaction
on
the
issues
of
ultimate
liability.
we
therefore,
hold
that
the
flight
attendant’s
conduct
here
constitutes
an
accident
under
article
17.
