justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
don't
take
the
position
that...
that,
let's
say,
any
death
resulting
in
part
as
a
result
of
one,
but
not
the
only,
cause
of
the
preexisting
conditions
is
thereby
excluded
from
the...
the
class
of
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
every...
in
other
words,
having
a
heart
condition
does
not
immunize
olympic
airlines
against
liability
if
somebody
dies
of
a
heart
attack
per
se.
you're
not
taking
that
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
if...
if
they're
simply
sitting
in
the
seat
and
nothing
unusual
happens
and
they
have
a
heart
attack
and
die,
sure,
there's
no
liability.
but
if
there
are
other
conditions...
and
the
argument
here
is
that
there
are
other
conditions...
and
the
heart
attack
was
merely
a
contributing
cause...
it
was
a
condition
upon
which
those
other
conditions
acted...
that
does
not...
the
existence
of
a
heart
condition
does
not
immunize
olympic
airlines
against
liability.
that's...
i
don't
think
that's
your
argument,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
they
say
the
injury-producing
event
is...
or
one
of
the...
the
analyses
is
the
unexpected
refusal
of
the
airline
personnel
to
allow
this
individual
to
get
moved
into
a
smoke-free
zone.
and
that
unusual
and
unexpected
event,
combined
with
the
smoke
and
the
heart
condition,
caused
the
death.
but
it
was
the
unexpected
refusal
to
remove
from
a
smoke
zone
that
is
the
unexpected
event
or
occurrence
that
is
the
accident.
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
was
assigned
a
non-smoking
seat
which
happened
to
be
in
a
zone
with
smoke.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
direct,
are...
are
you
trying
to
make
the...
the
act
omission
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
no...
no
one
is...
no
one
is
making
the
common...
i
don't
think
is
making
the
common
law
argument
here.
they're
saying
it
was
unexpected
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
somebody
who
wanted
a...
a
smokeless
seat,
who
found
there
was
smoke
in
the
area
of
the
seat
and
who
was
asked
to
be
moved,
would
be
refused
by
the
airline.
that
is
the
unexpected
event.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
point
is
the
allegations
are
not
of
negligence,
which
is
a
legal
and
normative
conclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
allegation
is
simply,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
a
stewardess
would
stand
there
and
say,
no,
you
can't
move
him.
whether
it
was
negligent
or
not
negligent,
it
simply
was
unexpected
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
they're
saying
that
satisfies
the
unexpected
event.
justice
david
h.
souter
which...
which
is
a
matter
of
defense.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
justice
o'connor's
question
and
my
question
is...
is
the
question
that
goes
to
whether
you
get
into
court
to
defend.
and
you're...
you're
giving
us
a...
an
argument
that,
in
effect,
we
weren't
negligent.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
our
questions
were
wasn't
it
unexpected
in
fact
that
somebody
would
be
in
the
position
that
this
passenger
was
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
lord
phillips'
misperception?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
option
being...
the
option
being
the
one
that
was
mentioned
a
moment
ago.
your
husband
can
get
up
and
try
to
get
somebody
else
to
move?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
wouldn't
you...
warsaw
convention
or
not,
wouldn't
you
call
it
an
accident
if
the
bystanders
had
put
up
an
advertisement
saying,
swim
with
us
for
$500,
and
then
they
stood
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
get
a
little
closer
to
our
situation,
wouldn't
it?
and
that...
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
might
well
be
an
accident.
