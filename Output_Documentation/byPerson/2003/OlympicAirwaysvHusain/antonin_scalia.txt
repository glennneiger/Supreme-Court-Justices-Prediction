this
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
case,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
are
we
talking
about
it
for?
i
mean,
it...
it...
the
issue
before
us
is
not
negligence.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
it
was
an
accident.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
surely
dictum
anyway.
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
the
dictum
in
that
case
that...
that
he
thought
that
this
case
came
out
right
below.
we
wouldn't
even...
we
wouldn't
even
give
dispositive
effect
to
our
own
dictum
much
less
to
the
dictum
of
a
court
of
appeals
in
england.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
about
saks.
it's...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fallacy
in
the
argument
that...
that
you...
you
run
and
that
the
government
runs
is
that
it
accepts
the
language
of
saks
as
the
totality
of
what
is
necessary
to
be
an
accident.
now,
saks
involved
a
fellow
who
had
some
problem
with
his
ear
which
was...
caused
him
harm
because
of
the
normal
depressor...
pressurization
of
the...
of
the
cockpit.
and
in
denying
relief
under
the...
under
the
convention,
the
court
says,
no,
that
wasn't
an
accident
because
the
cockpits
are
pressurized
all
the
time,
and
if
it...
it
has...
to
be
an
accident,
it
has
to
be
an
unexpected
or
unusual
event
or
happening.
okay.
saks
was
not
saying
that
that
is
a
sufficient
condition
to
be
an
accident.
it
was
just
saying
that
that
is
a
necessary
condition.
now,
let
me...
let
me
give...
give
you
a
hypothetical
and
you
tell
me
why...
why
this
would
be
an
accident.
it
seems
to
me
the
hypothetical
closely
parallels
what
happened
here.
a
man
hurls
himself
into
the
sea
intending
to
commit
suicide.
there
is
right
nearby
to
where
he
hurled
himself
into
the
sea
a
dock
with
30
people
on
it
and
30
life
preservers
at
their
feet,
and
not
a
single
one
of
them
picks
up
the
life
preserver
and
throws
it
to
the
drowning
man.
i
don't
know
why.
maybe
they're
30
libertarians
who
think
people
should
be
able
to
kill
themselves.
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly...
certainly
an
unexpected
and
unusual
event.
who
would
imagine
that
with
30
life
preservers
within
reach
of
the
man,
nobody
would
throw
one.
now,
would
anybody
in
his
right
mind
say
that
this
man
died
because
of
an
accident?
justice
scalia
of
course,
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
unexpected
and
unanticipated
is
a...
a
necessary
condition
for...
for
saying
that
something
was
caused
by
an
accident,
but
it's
surely
not
a
sufficient
condition.
and
it
seems
to
me
what
happened
in
this
plane
is
exactly
like
that.
it
is
an
event
after
the
person
was
endangered.
i...
i
don't
think
that
this
person
died
because
of
an
accident.
it
just
doesn't
make
it.
and
that's
the
language
of
the
convention,
not
saks.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
willing
to
say
that
negligent
conduct
such
as
occurred
here
can
be
an
accident.
of
course,
it
can.
if...
if
the
flight
attendant
spills
some
hot
liquid
on
the
passenger
causing
the
passenger
to
be
scalded,
of
course,
that...
that's
an
accident.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
fits
the
normal...
the
normal
concept
of
accident.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happened
here
does
not
fit
the
normal
description
of
accident.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
let's
say
it
wasn't
a
bystander.
let's
say
that,
you
know,
they
were...
they
were
relatives.
they're
the
parents
of...
of
the
person
who
jumped.
you
still
wouldn't
call
that
an
accident,
would
you?
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with...
with
whether
there's
a
duty
or
not?
some
states
do
impose
a
duty
on...
on
bystanders,
by
the
way,
and
let's
assume
that
happens
in
a
state
where
there
is
a
duty.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
still
wouldn't
call
it
an
accident,
i
don't
think.
i
mean,
nobody
would
use
the
english
language
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
think
there
may
be
a
public
policy
reason
for
construing
accident
contrary
to
its
normal
meaning
to
embrace
in
this
context
intentional
acts
whether
by
the
airline
employees
or
by
pirates
or...
or
terrorists
or
anybody
else.
but
i
don't...
i...
there...
there's
a
problem
in
my
mind
about
interpreting
it
to...
to
embrace
especially
negligent
omissions.
it
seems
to
me
that's
so
far
away
from
the
normal
meaning
of
accident
that
i
don't...
i
don't
see
the
justification
for
doing
it
especially
where
it
converts
the
convention
into
essentially
what
it
was
not
intended
to
be,
liability
for
negligence.
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
misinformation
didn't
bear
any
causality.
i
mean,
the...
the...
what
caused
the
injury
here
was...
was
not
the
misrepresentation
about
the
other
seats.
it
was
simply
the
failure
to
move
the
person
to
another
seat,
and
that
is
totally
an...
an
omission,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
take
it
back.
three...
three
omissions.
justice
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
they
had
to
show
more
than
that.
i
thought
they
had
to
show
that
they
did
everything
possible
to
prevent...
to
prevent
the...
justice
scalia
yes.
