mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
basically
two
reasons
why
we
think
that
article
17
imposes
liability
when
an
airline
knowingly
leaves
a
passenger
in
medical
jeopardy
without
taking
basic
measures
to
alleviate
the
harm.
first,
because
that
kind
of
action
violates
normal
industry
safety
practices
and
thus,
under
saks...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
sorry
if
i
said
that
kind
of...
i
meant
to
say
that
kind
of
action
under
saks
is
contrary
to...
to
the
normal
industry
safety
practices.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
scalia,
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
the
point
that
you're
making,
which
in
one
sense
i
think
is
a
correct
one,
is
that
the
language
of...
of
article
17,
if
one
looks
at
it
in
purely
colloquial
terms,
may
not
exactly
correspond
with
the
definition
in
saks.
but
the
language
in
article
17
isn't
used...
the
term
accident
isn't
used
purely
in
the
colloquial
sense.
what
we
know
from
the
context
of
the
convention
as
a
whole
and
the
liability
system
as
a
whole
and
from
saks
is
that
sometimes
it
actually
captures
less
than
the
colloquial
sense
of
the
term
accident,
sometimes
it's
more.
for
example,
the
mere
fact
that
somebody
has
a
heart
attack
typically
would
be,
in
the
colloquial
sense,
thought
of
as
an
accident.
but
we've
learned
from
saks
that
it
is
not
itself
going
to
be
considered
the
accident
because
of
the
context
of
article
17
and
the...
the
language
about
accidents
causing
death
or
bodily
injury.
by
the
same
token,
the
deliberate
refusal
to
help
somebody,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
his...
his
earlier
question
i
think,
is...
is
normally,
in
colloquial
terms,
not
thought
of
as
an
accident.
it's
not
inadvertent.
it's
deliberate.
but
we
know
under
article
17
that
deliberate
conduct
can,
in
fact,
be
an
accident.
if
a
flight
strikes
a
passenger
in
the
face
or
throws
coffee
on
the
passenger
in
a
fit
of
rage,
that
is
an
accident
for
purposes
of
article
17.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
scalia...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
of
course,
but...
but...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
my
example
is
not
a...
an
accidental
spilling.
i'm...
i'm
actually
talking
about
it
just
to
try
to
get
at
the
colloquial
sense,
which
i
think
is
what
disturbs
you,
that...
that
if...
if
in
fact
the...
the
flight
attendant
purposely
throws
the
coffee
on
the
passenger,
just
become
irritated
with
the
passenger,
that
would
not
normally
be
thought
of
as
an
accident,
if
you're
asking
people
around
the
coffee
shop
whether
there's
been
an
accident.
but
in
terms
of
article
17,
it
is
an
accident
because
we
know
article
17
covers
instances
of
willful
misconduct.
article
17
is
the
gateway
by
which
you
get
to
any
liability,
and
willful
misconduct
includes
certainly
the
kinds
of...
of
things
that
i'm
talking
about,
deliberate
conduct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
yes,
it
can,
justice
o'connor.
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
that's
a
little
bit
curious
in...
in
tying
the
two
questions
together
with
justice
scalia's
question,
this
is
a...
this
is
an
incident
which
in
fact
is
to
some
extent
intentional.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
mean,
the...
it
was
not
inadvertent
that...
that
the
passenger
was
left
in
his
seat.
for
example,
just...
just
to
take
a
different,
slightly
changed
analogy,
if
in
fact
the
passenger
had...
had
asked
to
be
moved
in...
out
of
the
vicinity
of
the
smoke,
and
the
flight
attendant
had
said,
let
me
wait
until
everybody
is
seated,
i'll
come
back
and
get
you
in
half
an
hour,
and
she
forgot
to
do
that,
that
would
actually
in
colloquial
terms
seem
more
like
an
accident.
somehow
negligently
she
forgot
to
come
back.
but
in
fact,
in
this
particular
case,
she
was
asked
three
times
and
knowing
in
fact
what
she
was
doing,
she
said,
no,
i'm
not
going
to
move
you.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
question
then
i
think...
the...
the
proper
way
to
answer
that,
justice
kennedy,
is
to
look
at
what
would
happen
in
the
normal
flight
under
the
normal
circumstances.
obviously,
under
the
circumstances
we
had
here,
it's
unusual
and
unexpected
that
she
didn't
move
him.
if
in
fact
the
reason
was
that
there
was
some
other
enormous
problem
on
the
plane
and
all
of
the
flight
attendants
had
to
deal
with
that
particular
problem,
then
it
seems
to
me
the...
the
action
here
would
not
be
unusual
and
unexpected.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
policy
of
the
airline
and
the
policy
generally,
because
i
think
they're
in
this
case
the
same...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
was
when
a
passenger
requests
a
move
for
medical
reasons,
that
the
policy
is
to
accommodate
that
request
if
it's
possible
to
do
so.
and
it
was
possible
here
because
there
were
empty
seats
in
the
coach
cabin,
so
we
don't
have
to
get
into
the
complicated
questions
of
whether
you
have
to
move
someone
to
first
class
or
to...
to
alleviate
the
problem.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
it's
possible
that
it
would.
i
mean,
i...
our
position
is
not
that
essentially
the
industry
can
give
itself
immunity
by
lowering
its
standards
so
much
that...
that
acts
that...
that
clearly
are
unusual,
but
nonetheless
within
the...
the
industry
standard
are...
are
immune
from
liability.
but
i
think
the
general
idea
is
in
trying
to
evaluate
things
that
aren't
obviously
accidents,
we
have
to
have
some
sort
of
benchmark
to
judge
whether
what's
happened
is
unusual.
the
natural
place
is
to
look...
is...
is
at
the
industry
practice.
and
if
in
fact
what
they've
done
is
consistent
with
industry
practice,
i
would
think
in
the
usual
case
certainly
that
would
suggest
there
hasn't
been
an
unusual
event.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
mean,
the...
the
fact
is
as
i
say,
that
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
having
a
very
low
standard
in
the
company
itself
or
in
the
industry
will,
in
fact,
give
you
immunity,
although
i
have
to
say
i
think
that
in
fact
that's
an
unlikely
thing
to
happen
because
when
we
talk
about
the
warsaw
convention,
there's
a
natural...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
i
think...
but...
but
the
analysis
would
be
the
same.
i
mean,
one
of
the
instructions
that
saks
gives,
i
think
correctly,
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
what
is
unusual
or
unexpected
under
certain
circumstances
would
not
be
unusual
or
expected...
unexpected
under
other
circumstances
like
the
one...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
justice
kennedy,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
necessary.
i
mean,
what
the
ninth
circuit
basically
said
was
this
is
an
unusual
or
unexpected
event
under
saks
because
it
violates
industry
policies,
industry
standards,
the
company
policy,
and
particularly
given
the
nature
of
the
request.
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
stopped
there,
it
seems
to
me
that
their
decision
would
be
absolutely
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it's
the
following
sentence
that
obviously
raises
at
least
some
questions.
and
i
should
say
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
language
in
itself
should
be
as
troubling
as
it
perhaps
appears
to
some
because
the...
the
situations
that...
that
the
court
describes
there
very
often
will
be,
it
seems
to
me,
unusual
or
unexpected
situations.
but
nonetheless,
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
following
the
adage
that
the
court
sits
to
review
judgments
and
not
opinions,
that
the
court
can
simply
say,
as
we...
we
suggest
would
be
sufficient,
that
you
do
have
an
unusual
and
unexpected
event
when
you
fail
to
help
a
passenger
in
violation
of
the
standard
industry
practice.
now,
if
the
standard
industry
practice
would
be
not
to
help
a
passenger
under
certain
circumstances
and
the
claim
is
still
made
that
it's
unusual
or
unexpected,
one
would
need
another
benchmark
for
reference,
but
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
that
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to...
to
also
point
out
that
in...
in...
when
we're
talking
about
the
language
of...
of
article
17,
while
i
think
it's...
it's
proper
to...
to
focus
on
the
language
itself
and
discuss
it
in...
in
the
context
of
saks,
that
it's
also
i
think
proper
to
look
at
the
context
of
the
convention
as
a
whole
and
whether,
in
fact,
competing
interpretations
of
the
term
accident
would
lead
to
absurd
consequences.
here
i
think
if
in
fact
the
definition
or
the
application
of
the
definition
that
olympic
tries
to...
to
urge
on
the
court
is
accepted,
that
one
is
going
to
find
that...
that
this
convention,
which
is
intended
to
be
the
exclusive
means
of
remedy
for
passengers
who
suffer
death
or
bodily
injury
on
an
international
flight,
is...
is
going
to
have
essentially
a
hole
in
it
where
it
doesn't
cover
situations
even,
as
in
this
case,
whether
it's
willful
misconduct
by
the
airline
crew
that
causes
the
injury.
and
the
focus
that...
you
know,
in
terms
of
whether
that
is
a
reasonable
understanding
to
attribute
to
the
parties
to
the
convention
under
the
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
when
you...
when
you
say
a
positive
act
would
be
an
accident,
an
omission
that
would
cause
an
accident
would
be...
you
know,
would...
would
involve
an
accident,
but
there's
liability
whatsoever
for
situations
in
which
the...
the
conduct
itself
is
the
contributing
factor,
the
failure
to
do
something
is
the...
is
a
strong
contributing
factor,
doesn't
really
make
any
reasonable
sense
as
a
construction,
and
particularly
because
one
of
the
things
that
the...
the
parties
must
have
understood
is
that
during
the
time
that
the
passenger
is...
is
covered
by
article
17,
if
you
will,
from
the
time
of
embarkation
to
the
time
of
disembarkation,
the
passenger
is
largely
in
the
control
of
the
airline.
the
airline
determines
where
the
passenger
sits.
so
the
passenger's
opportunities
to
engage
in
self-help
are
greatly
reduced.
and
in
that
situation,
the
idea
that
the...
that
the
parties
thought
that
airlines
could
simply
say
we
have
passengers
on
our
plane
who
need
our
help
for
medical
reasons,
and
we're
not
going
to
provide
any
help
whatsoever
and
that
either
causes
greater
injury...
causes
injury
in
the
first
place,
causes
greater
injury,
or
in
an
unhappy
case
like
this
one,
actually
causes
a
death,
their
theory
would
say
there's
still
no
liability.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
you
would
need
a
very,
very
clear
indication
from
the
text,
which
doesn't
exist
here,
to
reach
that
result.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
depends
on
the
circumstances,
but
i
think
the
general
industry
practice
would
be,
in
fact,
that
an
airline
would
be...
would...
would
normally
divert
to
a
nearer
airport
in
fact
to...
to
save
the...
the
passenger
from
death
or
from
much
more
severe
injury.
that
in
a
sense
is
the
krys
case,
the
eleventh
circuit
case,
that
olympic
says
is
in
conflict
with
the
decision
in
this
case.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
well,
the...
the
failure
to
divert,
which
it...
it
was
agreed
would...
would
have
made
a
significant
difference
to
the
passenger's
health,
was
not
unusual
because
the
plane
just
did
the
normal
thing.
it
just
flew
to
its
regular
destination.
but
the
problem
with
krys
is
that
if
you
look
at
all
the
circumstances,
as
saks
says,
it's
not
the
normal
thing
just
to
fly
on
to
your
intended
destination
when
a
passenger
has
had
a
heart
attack
and
the
medical
indication...
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
this
context.
i
mean,
obviously,
sometimes
it's...
it's...
if...
if
the
context
is
the...
the
failure
to
help
a
passenger
in...
in
medical
distress,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
usual
practice
of...
of
the
airline
or
the
industry
in
general
is...
is
the
proper
benchmark,
at
least
initially,
for
determining
whether
something
is
usual
or
unusual.
now,
obviously,
there
are
other
kinds
of
accidents,
crashes
and
hijackings
and
all,
where...
where
common
knowledge
tells
you
what
happened
is
unusual,
but
where
common
knowledge
doesn't
necessarily
tell
you
the
answer,
then
it
does
seem
that
reference
to
industry
standards
is
a
useful
benchmark.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the
event
is
under...
under
saks...
i
mean,
the
difference
is
that
an
accident
has
to
be
an
unusual
event,
that
not
every
event
is
an
accident.
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
it's
unusual,
and...
and
much
of
what
we've
talked
about
this
morning,
obviously,
is...
is
why
this
would
be
unusual
by
reference
to
industry
standards.
but
an
event,
if
one
looks
at
a
dictionary
definition,
is
simply
something
that
happened
on
the
plane.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
it
is
now.
it
was
at
one
time
triggered
by
an
occurrence,
and
under
the
1999
montreal
convention
it's
triggered
by
an
event.
yes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
don't...
i
am
not
sure
the
result
was
wrong.
i
don't
think
the
approach
was
correct.
i
think
the
court
should
have
asked
what
the
usual
industry
practice
would
have
been
in
that
case,
and
if
the
usual
industry
practice
would
have
been
to
make
an
accommodation
along
the
lines
that...
that
the
passenger
requested,
then
i
think
that
might
have
well
have
been
an
accident.
i
think
it's
a...
it's
a
difficult
question
as
to
whether
that
would
have
been
true
because
that
particular
passenger
needed
to
be
moved
into
first
class,
needed
two
first
class
seats,
and
in
fact
part
of
the
solution
was
he
was
perhaps
going
to
introduce
self-induced
vomiting
as
a
cure,
which
obviously
would
affect
other
passengers
in
the
cabin.
so,
you
know,
on
the
facts,
one
ultimately
might
have
said...
the...
the
judgment
that
was
made
there
actually
comported
with...
with
the
usual
industry
standards.
however,
we
don't
know
the
answer
because
the
third
circuit
didn't
ask
the
right
question.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
krys...
we
have
an
additional
piece
of
information
because
the
court
went
on
to
decide
the
case.
this
was
pre
tseng.
so
it
actually
decided
the
case
as
a
common
law
negligence
case,
and
when
it
did
so,
it
found
that
what
the
airline
had
done
by
not
diverting
in
that
particular
case
was
a
violation
of
industry
standards.
so
in
that
case
i
think
what
should
have
happened
in
krys
is
that
the
court
should
have
made
that
inquiry
as
part
of
the
warsaw
convention
analysis,
and
if
it
had
done
so
in
fact,
it
would
have
limited
the
recovery
in
krys,
which
was
many
millions
of
dollars,
to
the
limits
of
the
warsaw
convention,
supplemented
by
the
agreements.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
