justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
know
you
didn't
argue
about
negligence,
but
you
do
seem
to
draw
a
distinction
between
affirmative
conduct
on
the
one
hand
and
failure
to
act
on
the
other
hand.
and
my
question
to
you
is,
supposing
that
without
asking
the
stewardess,
the
passenger
had
gotten
into
a...
a
non-smoking
seat
seven
or
eight
rows
ahead
of
where
he
was
sitting
and
then
was
ordered
to
return
to
his
seat.
would
that
have
been
an
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
have
been.
justice
stevens
it
would
not
have
been.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then...
then
you
don't
rely
on
a
distinction
for
the
action
and
non-action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you...
you
say
you
wouldn't
draw
the
distinction
i
suggested.
so
assume
the
case
was
the
other
way
around,
that
the
stewardess
told
him
to
get
back
to
his
seat.
now,
why
would
that
not
be
an
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
if
the
stewardess
had
gone
to
the
captain
of
the
plane
and
said,
we've
got
a
guy
in
the
back
seat
who
said
he's
going
to
die
because
he
can't
stand
smoke,
he
wants
to
sit
in
the
front
seat,
and
he's
grabbed
a
seat
up
there,
should
i
order
him
back
to
the
old
seat,
and
the
captain
says,
yes,
send
him
back,
would
that
be
an
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
the...
the
airline
gave
the
passenger
the
option
to
reseat
himself,
wasn't
it
the
option
to...
to
request
another
passenger
to
change
seats
with
him?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farr,
can
i
interrupt
for
a
second?
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
question
of
whether
you
move
a
passenger
or
not,
you
could
have
a
situation
which
for
security
reasons,
as
they
have
around
washington,
every
passenger
must
remain
in
his
or
her...
her
seat
for
500
miles
or
30
minutes
or
so,
and
refusal
to
move
during
that
period
could
not
possibly
be
an
accident.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
comment
on
the
distinction
between
an
event
and
an
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
would
affect
the
liability
for
loss
of
baggage
and
so
forth.
that's
triggered
by
an
event,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
that
it
could
have
happened
somehow
in
an
airline
context,
would
you
say
that
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
was
an
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
airline's
fault
even
required?
supposing
that
before
the
plane
took
off,
there
was
a
big
fire
in
the
area
and
smoke
filled
the...
filled
the
aircraft
while
it
was
on
the
runway
and
then
he
died
from
that
smoke,
would
that
be
an
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
going
to
be
an
accident
within
the
meaning
of
the
convention
is
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
the
smoke
doesn't
have...
the...
the...
whatever
the
accidental
cause
is,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
fault
of
the
airline.
