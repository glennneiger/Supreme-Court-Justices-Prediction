well,
it
could
and
it
is
different
from
ordinary
negligence.
i
mean,
it
is
conceivable
at
least
that
to
have
an
airline
stewardess
say
no
when
the
policy
of
the
airline
and
the
standard
generally
is
to
the
contrary
and
to
say,
no,
i
will
not
consider
moving
you
even
though
there
were
seats
further
away
from
the
smoke
origin.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
was
it
determined
here
that
the
passenger
died
from
smoke
exposure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
we
take
the
case
on
that
understanding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
the
case
that
there
would
have
been
seats
possibly
available
more
removed
from
the
smoke
so
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
as
heavy
an
exposure
to
smoke?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
here
there
was
a
total
refusal
to...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
provide
any
help.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
know
if
we
really
have
to
get
into
the
act
versus
omission
question
here
because
this
was
more
than
that.
it
was
a
refusal
to
take
action
in
the
face
of
an
alleged
severe
medical
problem
and
in...
in
contravention
to
the
rules
of
the
airline
at
the
time.
so
you
could
characterize
this,
i
think,
as
some
kind
of
positive
action,
in
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
request
made?
i
thought
the
wife
made
a
request.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me.
justice
o'connor
oh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
of
course,
the
exposure
might
have
been
substantially
reduced
if
the
passenger
had
been
able
to
get
seated
in
an
area
further
removed
from
the
active
smokers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
the
question.
is
it
an
accident?
you
assume
it.
you
say
that
kind
of
accident.
well,
i
think
that's
the
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
this
be
said
to
be
that
kind
of
conduct
where
it's
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
airline?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
was
unusual
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
isn't
this
an
accident
in
the
same
sense
that
having
an
attendant
throw
hot
coffee
on
a
passenger
would
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
didn't.
it
went
on
and
got
a
bunch
of
negligence
language
in
there.
