justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
take
it...
i
take
it
you
think...
is
it
abramson
in
the
third
circuit
where
they...
the...
the
passenger
can't
lie...
lie
down.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
take
the
position
that
case
is
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
that's...
it
seems
to
me
there's
an
accident
in
that
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
there
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
the
internal
cause
is...
is
much
greater
than
it...
it
is
here.
let...
let's...
can
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption...
i
think
we
must
take
the
case
on
the
assumption,
based
on
the...
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
that
if
they
had
moved
the
passenger,
the
event
would
not
have
occurred.
justice
kennedy
now...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
take
the
case
on
that
assumption,
it's...
it
seems
to
me
it's
got
to
be
an
accident.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
there
were
five
rows
of
empty
seats
in
front
and
a...
a
stewardess...
and
there
are
stewardesses
like
this
sometimes
that
we
don't
people
wandering
around
the
plane.
we're
serving
food.
you
must
sit
down
in
your
seat.
a
different
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your...
your
submission
is
if
the
airline
requires
you
to
sit
in
the
no-smoking
seat
for
no
particularly
good
reason,
there's
still
no
accident.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
my
hypothetical.
justice
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one...
just
one...
one
row
ahead.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
she...
what
if
she'd
been
asked
to
move
him,
and
she
said
i'll
be
back,
and
then
another
passenger
gets
very
ill
and
she
has
to
take
care
of
him
right
away,
and
then
the
facts
are
the
same.
accident
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
role
does
fault
play?
it...
it
seemed
to
me,
as
i
was
reading
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
saks,
that
negligence
is
probably
not
a
requisite.
i
don't
know
if
that
makes
it
necessary
for
us
to
send
it
back.
suppose
we
think
that's
true.
would
we
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
no,
no,
negligence
is...
is
not
the
standard,
go
ahead
and
find
fault
on
their...
or
whether
or
not
there's
an
accident
under
some
other
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
abramson
case
in
the
third
circuit
was
properly
decided?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would...
would
you
say
that
we
ought
to
write
the
opinion
so
that
if
there
is
negligence,
that
is
evidence
that
normal
airline
practices
were
not
being
followed,
and
that's
an
accident?
so
that
negligence
is
important
to
the
analysis,
not
necessary,
but
it...
it
can
be
helpful.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or...
or
should
we
write
the
opinion
without
talking
about
negligence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
negligence
is
a
proxy
for
the
fact
that
normal
airline
operating
rules
were
not
being
followed.
