ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
flight
attendant's
refusal
to
assist
an
ill
passenger
can
amount
to
an
accident
within
the
meaning
of
the
warsaw
convention.
the
analysis
focuses
on
whether
such
conduct
is,
objectively
speaking,
unusual
or
unexpected,
taking
into
account
the
ordinary
practices
in
the
industry
and
other
indicia
of
what
would
be
expected
in
the
circumstances.
at
a
minimum
it's
reasonable
to
construe
the
convention's
term
accident,
as
the
united
states
construes
it,
to
encompass
the
aberrant
conduct
of
the
flight
crew,
and
this
court
has
ordinarily
accorded
weight
to
the
united
states'
reasonable
construction
of
treaties
to
which
it
is
a
party.
our
reading
of
the
term
accident
comports
with
the
text
structure
and
purposes
of
the
convention.
the
term
is
a
broad
and
inclusive
one.
it's
not
confined
to
crashes
or
explosions
or
equipment
failures.
as
the
court
recognized
in
saks,
it
can
encompass
a
wide
array
of
unusual
and
unexpected
events
external
to
the
passenger
potentially...
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
think
that
a
failure
of
an
airline
employee
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
a
passenger
can,
indeed,
be
an
accident.
one
must
recall
that
even
under
the
common
law,
common
carriers
such
as
airlines
have
been
understood
to
have
special
obligations
toward
their
passengers,
not
expansive
obligations
to
act
as
physicians
to
them,
but
to
provide
reasonable
first
aid
until
they
reach
the
destination.
so
i
think
that...
that
this
particular
context
is...
is
quite
different
from
the
context
when
one
is
dealing
with
just
a
bystander.
and
i
think
under
the
common
law
as
well,
there
have
been
other
situations
that
might
well
be
viewed
as
accidents
that
involved
omissions
when
one
is
under
a
duty
to
act.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
i
think
the
inquiry
here...
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
i
think
here
under
the
warsaw
convention,
the
term
accident
has
been
understood
to
refer
to
an
unusual,
unexpected
event.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
that
would...
that
would
seem
to
be
an
accident.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
other
circumstances...
medical
malpractice
cases,
for
example,
might
be
those
where
an
omission
of
some
sort,
because
the
doctor
is
under
a
duty
to
act,
could
be
viewed
as
an
accident.
for
example,
a
failure
to
diagnose
or
to
treat
a
particular
medical
condition
until
it's
too
late,
if
that
was
negligent,
could
be
an
accident.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
would
say
that...
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
would
say
that
the
test
is
objective
reasonableness
which
connotes
some
of
the
same
concepts
as
negligence
does
in
the
common
law.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
not
in
all
circumstances
because
negligence
isn't
a
necessary
condition
for
an
accident
to
occur.
an
accident
could
be
an
act
of
god
and
an
event
that
did
not
involve
negligence.
in
this
particular
case,
yes,
the
inquiry
into
due
care
and
the
inquiry
into
an...
whether
an
accident
has
occurred
are
quite
similar,
but
they're
still
focused
on
a
different
question.
the
accident
inquiry
asks
whether
something
unusual
or
unexpected
has
happened,
and
the
due
care
inquiry
under
article
20
asks
whether
the
airline
has
acted
with
due
care.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
correct.
now,
there
may
be
isolated
instances
where
although
ordinary
practices
were
being
followed,
those
practices
were
so
deficient
that,
nonetheless,
an
accident
might
be
found.
normally,
however,
i
think
that...
that
airlines'
practices
are
to
treat
passengers
reasonably.
so
i
think
that
asking
the
reasonableness
question
would
be
the
same
as...
as
seeing
whether
there
was
a
deviation
from
standard
policies
and
practices.
in
construing
the...
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
of
course,
in
this
case
we
don't
have
a
mere
negligent
omission.
we
have
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
willful
misconduct.
we
also
found...
this
case
also
involves
a...
a
refusal
to
act,
a
series
of
refusals
to
act,
and...
and
provision
of
misinformation
about
whether
the
flight
was
completely
full
or
not.
so
it's...
it's
difficult
to
characterize
this
particular
case...
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
don't
think
it's
properly
characterized
as
an
omission
when
there
were
three
increasingly
desperate
requests
to
reseat
the
passenger
and
the
flight
attendant
responded
on
each
occasion...
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
think
that
this
sort
of
case
can
be
contrasted,
for
example,
from
a...
a
simple
failure
to
warn
case
where
the
question
is
whether
an
airline
should
have
warned
about
a
particular
medical
condition
that
a
passenger
might
have
in
response
to
ordinary
flight.
this
seems
to
involve
much
more.
certainly
lord
phillips
in
the
english
court
of
appeals
thought
that
this
case
involved
much
more
than...
than
just
a
failure
to
act.
the
drafters
of
the
warsaw
convention
certainly
didn't
intend
that
airlines
would
be
insurers
for
any
harm
that
befell
a
passenger
during
flight.
they
did
intend,
however,
that
airlines
would
be
held
liable
when
their
own
fault
caused
a
passenger's
death
or
bodily
injury.
indeed,
they
eliminated
the
caps
on
damages
in
cases
when
that
fault
rose
to
the
level
of
willful
misconduct.
this
would
seem
doubtful
that
the
drafters
intended
simply
by
their
choice
of
the
term
accident
to
exempt
airlines
entirely
from
liability
in
cases
where
passengers
died
or
suffered
bodily
injury
because
of
the
airline's
fault,
including
willful
misconduct
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
could
well
be
an
accident,
your
honor.
it
might
not
be
an
accident
for
which
liability
would...
would
be
properly...
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
it
probably
would.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct
because
the
airlines
have
the
opportunity
under
article
20
of
the
convention
to
come
back
and
say
that
we
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
this
accident
because
we
did
not
act
negligently.
the
understanding...
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
the
term
in
the
treaty
is
all
necessary
measures.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
but
it's
been
construed
to
mean
all
reasonable
measures.
so
it's
essentially
been
understood
as
a...
a
due
care
defense.
and
that's
reinforced
in
the
montreal
convention,
the
new
convention
that
has
just
come
into
force,
that...
that
uses
the
term
negligence
in
its
own
words.
the
understanding
that
the
accident
requirement
can
be
satisfied
in
cases
like
this
one
serves
the
convention's
purpose
of
balancing
the
interests
of
air
carriers
and
passengers.
such
cases
do
not
pose
a
threat
of
particularly
expansive
liability
to
airlines.
cases
such
as
this
one
where
air
carriers
do
something
that
is
unusual
and
unexpected
and
thereby
cause
a
passenger's
death
or
bodily
injury
can
be
expected
to
remain
relatively
few
under
the
convention,
as
they
are
under
u.s.
domestic
law.
imposing
liability,
meanwhile,
enables
passengers
and
their
families
to
receive
some
measure
of
compensation
for
their
injuries
and
provides
appropriate
incentives
for
airline
supervision
and...
and
training
of
their
personnel.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we'd
ask
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
