mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
over
70
years
ago,
the
drafters
of
the
warsaw
convention
created
a
treaty
which
set
forth
the
circumstances
under
which
air
carrier
liability
should
be
created
in
the
event
of
passenger
injury
or
death.
the
legal
regime
they
created
recognized
there's
circumstances
where
the
passenger
should
be
entitled
to
a
cause
of
action,
but
it
also
expressly
recognized
the
need
to
limit
that
liability
and
set
forth
certain
conditions
when
that
limited
liability
would
apply.
article
17
of
the
warsaw
convention
creates
a
presumption
of
liability
but
only
when
three
conditions
precedent
are
satisfied.
one,
there
has
to
be
an
accident
in
which
the
passenger
suffers
a
bodily
injury
or
dies
and
the
accident
took
place
on
board
the
aircraft
or
during
the
course
of
embarking
or
disembarking.
the
issue
before
the
court
here
today...
we're
dealing
with
the
accident
condition
precedent.
was
that
satisfied
in
this
case?
of
course,
the...
the
court
in
saks
in
1985
specifically
addressed
the
issue
of
what
is
an
accident,
and
the
court
defined
an
accident
as
an
unusual
and
unexpected
event
that's
external
to
the
passenger.
of
a
particular
importance
to
this
case
is
where
the
court
declined
to
extend
the
accident
and
encompass
an
injury
that
results
from
the
passenger's
own
internal
condition
and...
and
in
response
to
the
normal
and
expected
operations
of
the
aircraft.
thus,
until
recently,
the
courts
have
held
that
injuries
arising
out
of
the
passenger's
preexisting
medical
conditions
do
not
satisfy
the
accident
condition
precedent
even
if
there
were
allegations
of
air
carrier
negligence.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i
think
you
have...
justice...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
our
position
is
that
if
somebody
is
on
board
an
aircraft
and
they
die
of
a
heart
attack,
that
is...
that
is
not
an...
that's
a...
the
passenger's
own
internal
reaction
and
it
just
happened
to
be...
the
passengers
happened
to
be
on
board
the
aircraft.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
no.
what
the
argument
is...
and
in
this
case
here,
you
have
to
look
to
what
is
the
injury-producing
event?
the
injury-producing
event
here...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
characterization,
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
below,
in
that
in
this
case
you
have
to...
you...
you
can't
just
simply
look
to
the
fact
that
you
had
the
flight
attendant
saying
we're
not
going
to
move
you.
he
was
assigned
a
non-smoking
seat.
he...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
in...
on
board
any
aircraft,
when
smoking
is
allowed,
you
have
ambient
cigarette
smoke
throughout
the
aircraft,
and
in
this
case
you
have
to
look
to...
it
can't
be
disputed
that
this
passenger
reacted
to
the
cigarette
smoke
and
the
injury-producing
event
indirect...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
that's...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
however,
when
you
have...
when
you...
in
any
aircraft
when
you...
when
they
used
to
allow
smoking
on
the
aircraft,
as
at
this
time,
you
could
be
10
rows
away
and
you
would
still
be
exposed
to
that
ambient
cigarette
smoke.
but
the
point
we
have
to
look
to
is
with
respect
to
the
warsaw
convention
is
what
type
of
liability
did
they
want
to
create.
you
know,
when
we
get
into
issues
of
straying
away
from
the
direct
cause...
because
when
we
look
to
almost
every
single
warsaw
convention
accident
case,
the
focus
has
always
been
on
what
is
that
direct
injury-producing
event.
when
we
start
inserting
common
law
concepts
of...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
the
act
and...
in
one
respect,
but...
but
in
the
broader
sense,
you
have
to
look
to
is
what
has
always
been
the
event
the
courts
have
looked
to,
what
did
the
drafters
intend
the
event...
the...
the
cause
to
be?
it's
not...
i
don't
think
it's
proper
to
inject
full-blown
common
law
notions
of
proximate
causation.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
but...
but
that's
what
courts
have
done
after
the
supreme
court's
decision
here
by
the
court
in
tseng
because
at
that
time,
before
tseng,
courts
used
to
find
that
it
didn't
matter
whether
you
had
allegations
of
true
negligence
because
we
do
have
to
look
to...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i...
i
disagree.
i
don't
think
that
satisfies
the
unexpected
event.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i
don't
believe
in
the...
for
purposes
of
the
article
17
accident
analysis,
you...
you...
your...
you
should
or
should
be
allowed
or
it's
proper
to
go
beyond
looking
to
asking
what
is
that
injury-producing
event.
in
this
instance
here,
we
have
to
remember
too
that,
yes,
there
were
three
requests
to
be
moved.
however,
the
passenger
himself
never
asked
to
be
moved.
it
was
always
through
his
wife.
he
was
a
doctor.
he
knew
his
own
condition.
i
mean,
we
can
all
get
into
the
whole
reasonableness
issue,
but
what
happened...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes,
it's
a
matter
of
defense.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i
don't...
well,
i
think
that's
where
the
courts
below
and
where
you
get...
where
you
can
cross
the
lines
and
confuse
the
concepts
of
negligence
and
causation
in
this
case
because
here
you
could
say
was
it
unusual,
unexpected
for
a...
for
a...
when
a
passenger
makes
a
request
to
be
moved.
in
a
certain
sense,
yes,
you
could
say
that
it
was...
it
could
unusual,
unexpected,
but
i
think
you
have
to
come
back
to
is
but
is
that
the
injury-producing
event.
and
that's
what
the
courts
look
to.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
there
were
other
seats
available,
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
in
the
economy
seat
section.
i
think
when
you...
it
was
very
difficult
to
determine
because
the
plane
was...
there
were
approximately
11
seats.
some
of
those
11
seats
were
in
the
smoking
section,
but
the...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
there
were
the
non-revenue
people,
but
when
you
look
to
the
record,
the
only
way
you
could
determine
the
non-revenue
people...
in
fact,
we
had
to
submit
post-trial
submissions
after
the
trial
to...
for
somebody
to
testify
to
interpret
the
codes
that
were
on
the
passenger
manifest
to
determine
who
were
revenue
and
who
were
non-revenue.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
have...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
it's
not...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
exactly.
it
is
whether
it
was
an
accident.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
under
the
circumstances,
no,
i
don't
think
under...
for
purposes
of
the
warsaw
convention,
that
would
have
been
an
accident.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
it
would
not
have
been
an
accident.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
because
again,
the
injury...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
because...
well,
i
do
rely
on
the
distinction
between
action
and
non-action
because
you
could
have
an
omission
which
in
and
of
itself
cannot
be
an
accident.
i...
i
really
gave
a
lot
of
thought
to
this.
i
looked
at
the
cases
and
i
could
never
find
a
pure
omission
being
an
accident.
a
omission
can
result
in
an
accident.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
the...
the
bottom
line
of
the
allegations
here
were
that
the...
the
flight
attendant
should
have
taken
action
to
move
mr....
dr.
hanson
to
another
seat,
and
failure
to
do
so
would
be...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
and
part
of
what...
part
of
what
she
had...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
in
itself
an
omission.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
generally
in...
under
negligence
law...
under
negligence
law
a
negligence
can
be
an
act
or
omission.
but
here,
when
you're
looking
to
the
treaty
of
an
accident
defined
as
an
unusual,
unexpected
event
or
happening,
you
basically
have
a
non-event,
something
that
did
not
happen.
you...
you
see
that
i
think
in
the...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
because
at
that
point,
when
he
got
back
to
his
seat,
he
would
be
back
to
his
normal
assigned
non-smoking
seat.
while
in
close
proximity
to
the
smoking
section,
again,
you
have
to
see
that
smoke
on
a
smoking
aircraft,
a
known
smoking
aircraft,
nobody...
you
know,
there
was
no
surprise
here
when
he
got
on
board
on
this
aircraft
that
there
was
a...
there
was
going
to
be
smoke
on
this
aircraft...
is
not
an
unusual,
unexpected
event.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
under
the
warsaw
convention,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
an
accident,
and
here's
why.
it...
these
are
extreme
examples
that...
with
respect
to
that
where...
the
passenger
in
this
case...
don't
forget
too,
the
flight
attendant
did
give
the
option
to
this
passenger
to
move.
he
could
have
taken
self-help
to
remedy
the
situation,
but
he
opted
not
to.
but
in
those
type
of
situations,
you
have
instances
where
they're
very
extreme
examples,
but...
and
the
convention
doesn't
necessarily
provide
a
remedy
for
all
those
types
of
situations.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
exactly,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no.
that...
that
position...
that
case
is...
is
100
percent
correct
and
it's
very
analogous
to
our
case
because
in
the
abramson...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
in
that
case,
the...
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
was
not
an
accident.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
abramson
followed
the...
almost
the
exact
criteria
set
forth
by
the
court
in
saks.
was
it
an
unusual,
unexpected
event?
and
they
found
that
being
seated
in
an
aircraft
seat...
you're
assigned
an
aircraft
seat...
is
not...
and
sustaining
an
injury
due
to
your
own
internal
reaction
was
not
an
accident
because
they,
again,
focused
on
what
was
the
precise
factual
event
that
led
to
the
injury.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
we
have
to...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes.
we
have
to
take...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i
disagree,
justice
kennedy,
because
again,
i...
i
just
come
back
to
when
i
was
looking
at
all
the
cases
and
looking
at
the
treaty
and
the
text
of
the
convention,
you
always
do
have
to
look
to
the
injury-producing
event
because
the
text
of
the
treaty
says
an
accident
which
causes
the
damage.
and
i
think
it
does
come
down
to
showing
what
is
the
direct
event.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
krys
case,
i
think
the
court...
the
eleventh
circuit
in
krys
clearly
set
forth,
i
think,
a
very
workable
standard.
they
say
let's
look
at
the...
we
ask
let's
look
at
the
precise
event.
we
look
at
what
were
the
precise
events
that
caused
this
injury,
not
the
actions
of
the
air
carrier
that
they
could
have
taken
to
avert
that
injury.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
there
was
at
the...
there
was
a...
a
legal
finding
that
it
was
the
smoke
that
killed
the
passenger
even
though...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
you
would
have
to
take
the
case
on
the
understanding
because
we
didn't
raise
the
factual
issue
that
he
would
have
died
from
the
food
poisoning.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i
don't...
i
don't
think
there
was
any
evidence
to
establish
the
concentrations
of
the
cigarette
smoke.
there
were
seats
that
were
further
removed,
but
then
you
come
down
to,
again,
factual
issues
or
determinations
as
to,
well,
how
far
do
you
remove
the
passenger.
is
three
further
rows
further
ahead,
five
rows
further
ahead
enough?
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
there
was
a...
well,
there
was
a...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
there
was
a
refusal
to...
there
was
a
refusal
to
move
him
because
the
flight
attendant
believed
the
flight
was
full,
and
it
was,
other
than
the
10
seats.
but
the...
the
flight
attendant
did
give
this
passenger
the
option
to
reseat
himself.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
what
caused
the
injury
was
his
exposure
to
the
cigarette
smoke
under
the
facts
of
this
case
and
on
the
findings.
and
then
we
have
to
determine
was
cigarette
smoke
in
that
area,
ambient
cigarette
smoke,
unusual,
unexpected,
and
even
the
lower
court
found
that
cigarette
smoke
on
a
smoking
aircraft
is
not
an
unusual,
unexpected
event.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
to
change
seats
with
him.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
or
he
could
have...
what
the...
or
he
could
have
moved
through
the
cabin
to
see
if
he
could
locate
an
empty
seat.
but
mind
you,
the
flight
attendant
never
had
any
direct
communications
with
dr.
hanson.
it
was
always
through
his
wife.
there
were
two
requests
made
to
move
on
initial
boarding.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no.
i
mean,
it
would
have
made
a
difference
in
the
lower
court
as
to
the
issue
of
reasonableness
and
things
like
that,
but
for
purpose
of
the
legal
issue
before
the
court,
no,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
because,
again,
when
you
look
at...
when
you
look
at
all
the
various
cases,
when
you
come
through
krys,
abramson,
and
the
other
pre-tseng
cases...
and
i
draw
that
distinction
before
tseng...
the
courts
universally
had
held
that
a
passenger's
injury
arising
out
of
his
own
internal
reaction
to
the
conditions
on
the
aircraft
is
not
an
accident.
and
when
you
look
to
the
history
of
the
convention
itself,
here
the
lower
courts,
in
effect...
while
we
say
they
didn't
use
negligence,
they,
in
effect,
imported
concepts
of
negligence,
reasonableness,
reasonable
alternatives,
things
like
that,
those
types
of
concepts.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
one
court
was
an
australian
court
in
povi,
a
lower
court
case,
which
that
case
has
been
appealed
and
argued
on
appeal.
and
that
case...
that
was
in
the
dvt
context.
i
think
that
court
suffered
from
the
same
fundamental
errors
that
the
courts
here
below
did
in
viewing
what
the...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
that...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes,
the
dvt
litigation.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
the...
on
the
dvt
litigation
case,
the
court
found
that...
he
disagreed
with
the
reasoning
of
the
lower
courts,
but
he
said
that
he
could
certainly
understand
the
result.
but
he
was,
again,
focusing
in
on
the
facts
because
if
you
applied
the...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes,
well...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
you're...
you're
right,
justice
scalia.
it
was
dicta.
and
what
happened
was
in
that
case,
i
think
he
had
a
misperception
of
the
facts
at
the
end
of
the
day,
and
if
you
applied
the
rationale
that
he
used
for
his
opinion
in
dismissing
those
cases,
the
facts
of
this
case
would
inevitably
lead
to
the
dismissal
of
this
case
and
a
finding
of
no
accident.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
as
to
the
enforced
exposure
to
the
cigarette
smoke
because...
because
the
passenger
here
was
given
the
option
to
relocate,
and
he
could
have
relocated
himself.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
switch
or
find
another...
one
of
the
available
empty
seats.
because
then
you
also
have
to
remember,
again,
i...
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
sure,
because...
because
at
the
time,
you
know,
there
were
only
11
empty
seats,
and
she
said
that
the
plane
is
full.
and
that...
and
that's
at
the
time
of
boarding
as
well,
in
the
middle
of
boarding.
it's
a
flight
that
had
been
delayed
for
3
hours.
everybody
is
coming
on
board
the
plane.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
the...
the
second
inquiry
was
just
before...
shortly
before
takeoff
on...
on
a
flight
delayed
for
3
hours,
and
they're
trying
to
take
off,
and
she
says,
i
can't
help
you
right
now.
and
one
thing...
and
then
the
third
one
was
shortly
after
takeoff.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no,
they
did
not
allow
smoking
before
takeoff.
it
wasn't
until
the
third
incident
shortly
after
takeoff
when
smoking
was
allowed,
and
then
she
said,
can
you
please
move
my
husband
now?
and
the
request
was
denied.
but
i
think
with...
with
respect
to
the
whole
accident
inquiry
issue
here,
we
also
have
to
look
to,
when
you
start
bringing
in
the
definition
of
what
is
an
accident,
when
you
start
equating
with
issues
of
negligence
and
common
law,
i
think
we
go
astray
and
go
contrary
to
what
the
drafters
intended
as
to
what
the
court
here
in
tseng
held,
that
you
don't...
accident
is
not
a
common
law
concept.
it's
a
self-contained...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no.
i
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg.
i
may
have
misspoke
because
you're
absolutely
right.
there
was
only
that
one
footnote
that...
where
the
court
did
express
concern
as
to
whether
the
court
in
the
second
circuit
flexibly
applied
the
tseng
decision.
but
i
was
talking
about
the...
what
i
meant
was
the
broader
context
of
tseng
with
respect
to
importation
or
allowing
a
parallel
state
cause
of
action
in
light
of
the
exclusivity
of
the
convention
and
the
uniformity
principles
set
forth
in
the
convention.
and
if
you
start
importing
concepts
of
negligence
back
into
the
convention...
because,
in
effect,
what
the
courts
are
doing
below
is
they're
saying,
fine,
we
can't
go
to
state
law,
but
what
we'll
do
is
we'll...
we'll
define
an
accident
to
make
it
equivalent
to
a
negligence
cause
of
action.
so
there's
really
no
difference.
what
the
courts
are
doing
is
nullifying
the
exclusivity
holding
by
equating
any
act
of
negligence
as
an
accident.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
when
you
read
the...
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it's...
it's
pure
negligence
language.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
it
was
a
refusal.
it
was
a...
it
was
a...
in
my
view,
it
was
an
omission,
and
i
think
at...
when
you
take
omissions
and
put
it
in
the
context
of
what
is...
is
that
an
unusual,
unexpected
event,
that
an
omission
cannot
in
and
of
itself
be
the
accident.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
i...
when
i
think
of
an
event,
i
think
of
some
type
of
positive
action,
and
in
this
instance,
when...
when
i
look
at
a
refusal
to
do
something,
i
look
at
it
as...
as
an
omission.
but
even
if
you
did
look
at
it
as
a
positive
event
here,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
you...
although...
everything
leads
us
back
to
trying
to
identify
was
the
event
that
caused
the
injury
here
unusual,
unexpected.
and
that...
there's
only
one
injury-producing
event.
for
example,
let's
say
nobody
asked
the
airline
in
this
case
to
move
dr.
hanson.
there
was
no
request
made,
and
he
remained
in
his
non-smoking
seat.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
a
hypothetical.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
let's
assume
no
request
had
been
made,
and
he
would
have
remained
in
that
same
non-smoking
seat
and
he
would
have
died
because
of
the
exposure
to
the
ambient
cigarette
smoke,
according
to
plaintiffs'
theory.
what
would
be
the
injury-producing
event
there?
what
caused
that
death?
his
internal
reaction
to
the
cigarette
smoke,
the
normal...
which
was
normal
and
expected.
now,
the
fact
that
they
asked...
somebody
asked
for
him
to
be
moved
doesn't
change
the
injury-producing
event.
the
injury-producing
event
is
the
same.
it's
the
exposure
to
the
cigarette
smoke.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
there...
he
still
would
have
had...
there
still
would
have
been
ambient
cigarette
smoke
throughout
the
cabin,
as
we
all
well
know.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no,
not
a
different
case
because
you
are
assigned
to
your
assigned
seat,
and
again,
it's
one
of
those
extreme
examples
that
if
i
believed
there
were
five
empty
rows
here,
he
probably
would
have
gotten
up
and
found
it
himself.
but
in
that
case,
i
don't
feel
there
would
be
a
different
case
because,
again,
i...
i
focus
in
on
this
injury-producing
event
here,
and
the
injury-producing
event
is
the
exposure
to
cigarette
smoke
which
was
normal
and
expected.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
oh,
i...
i
disagree
on
that
one
because
if
they
required
you
to
sit
in
a
non-smoking
seat
and
you
had...
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
okay.
if
they...
if
you...
if
they
require
you
to
sit
in
a
smoking
section?
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
there
would
be
no
difference
in
the
situation
from
this...
from
our
scenario.
there
still
would
not
be
an
accident.
he
was
assigned
a
non-smoking
seat
and
you...
again,
you
look
to
was
his
own
internal
reaction
here
to
the
normal
and
expected
operation
of
the
aircraft.
and
i
think
when...
when
you
look
at
the
convention,
the
structure
of
the
convention,
and
what
they
had
in
mind
by
the
term
accident,
you
have
to...
you
can
only
come
back
to
that
one
basic
conclusion,
that
you
look
to
what
is
that
injury-producing
event.
i'd
like
just
to
reserve
the
remaining...
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
when
you...
when
you
look
at
the
arguments
that
were
made
both
by
the
respondents
and
the
solicitor
general,
it
all
comes
back
to
the
issue
of
negligence,
wanting
to
equate
an
accident
with
negligence.
the
warsaw
convention
wasn't
an
all-encompassing
treaty.
there
were
certain
holes
left
in
the
convention
where
there
wasn't
going
to
be
recovery.
for
example,
if
there's
no
bodily
injury,
there's
no
recovery
under
the
warsaw
convention,
as
set
forth
by
the
floyd
decision,
no
matter,
let's
say,
how
egregious
the
air
carrier's
conduct
may
have
been.
it
set
forth
certain
things,
and
the
convention
wanted
to
define
the
liability
based
on
the...
by
using
that
term
accident
not
making
reference
to
various
common
law
notions.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
that
we're
seeing
is
that
confusing
what
is
the
accident...
and
that's
why
i
always
come
back
to
the
injury-producing
event.
in
the
hijacking
situation,
for
example,
the
accident
there
isn't
the
failure
of
the
airline
to
conduct
proper
screening
and
allowing
the
hijackers
to
come
on
board
the
aircraft.
the
accident
is
those
hijackers
get
on
the...
on
the
airplane
and
they
injure
a
passenger.
and
that...
the
injury
itself
is
the
accident.
just
like
in
the
smoke
example,
if
there
was
a
fire
someplace
and
the
cabin
filled
up
with
smoke,
the
smoke
itself
injuring
the
passenger
is
the
accident.
why
the
smoke
got
there
is
completely
irrelevant.
so
when
you...
when
you
start
injecting
the
whole
concepts
of
negligence,
i
think
you
upset
the
whole
balance
of
the
convention,
and...
and
one
of
the
principal
goals
of
the
convention
was
to
have
a
uniformity
and
to
limit
the
liability
of
the
carrier.
in
fact,
the
montreal
convention
of
1999,
which
just...
which
just
entered
into
force
last
week
here
in
the
united
states,
retained
the
term
accident.
the
issue
of
whether
the
carrier
should
be
liable
for
the
state
of
the
health
of
the
passenger
has
always
been
a
very
special
and
unique
issue
in
the
context
of
the
convention's
history.
post-ratification
conduct
from
1945
all
the
way
through
the...
all
the
way
to
the...
the
montreal
convention
of
1999,
the
contracting
states
were
very
careful
and
very
reluctant
to
make
the
carriers
liable
for
injuries
arising
out
of
their...
out
of
the
state
of
health
of
the
passenger.
and
the...
with
respect
to
the
policy
arguments
where
they
say...
where
the
respondents
and
solicitor
general
say
that
the...
there
are
certainly
policy
reasons
should
be
considered
in
weighing
in
favor
of
the
passengers
in
this
instance,
i
think
when
you
look
to...
you
have
to
apply
the
strict
terms
of
the
convention.
and
each
time
this
court
has
been
confronted
with
similar
policy
arguments,
they
have
been
rejected.
in
saks,
the...
the
passenger
was
left
without
a
remedy
because
they
couldn't...
because
the
passenger
couldn't
satisfy
the...
the
accident
condition
precedent.
the
same
thing
in
floyd.
there
they
couldn't
satisfy
the
bodily
injury
requirement.
and
in
tseng,
where
the...
there
was
no
remedy
allowed
under
state
law
when
they
couldn't
satisfy
the
accident
or
the
bodily
injury
conditions
precedent.
focusing
on
what
the
injury-producing
event
and
whether
that
event
is
unusual,
unexpected,
and
external
to
the
passenger...
thank
you,
your
honor.
