thank
you,
mr.

the
case
is

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
03
101,
norton
versus
southern
utah
wilderness
alliance.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
almost
half
of
the
state
of
utah’s
federal
land
administered
by
the
bureau
of
land
management
or
blm,
an
agency
within
the
department
of
the
interior.
this
case
involves
lands
which
may
in
the
future
be
designated
as
wilderness
areas.
the
respondent
of
southern
utah
wilderness
alliance
sued
the
bureau
of
land
management,
claiming
that
they
had
failed
to
protect
these
lands
from
damage
by
off
road
vehicles.
the
district
court
dismissed
all
three
of
respondent’s
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
respondent’s
first
claim
is
that
the
blm
failed
to
protect
wilderness
study
areas
from
off
road
vehicle
use.
a
violation
of
the
requirement
in
a
law
called
the
federal
land
policy
management
act,
which
i
shall
hereafter
refer
to
as
flpma,
that
blm
mismanaged
wilderness
study
areas
so
as
not
to
impair
their
suitability
for
preservation
as
wilderness.
however,
both
the
text
of
the
apa
and
pre-apa
mandamus
practice
make
it
clear,
that
such
a
claim
can
proceed
only
where
a
plaintiff
asserts
that
an
agency
fails
to
make
a
discrete
agency
action
that
is
required
to
take.
the
discrete-action
limitation
precludes
broad
programmatic
attacks
and
the
required
action
limitation
rules
out
judicial
direction
of
even
discrete
agency
action
that
is
not
demanded
by
law.
applying
these
principles
to
the
present
claim,
flpma’s
non-impairment
mandate
is
mandatory
as
to
the
object
to
be
achieved;
it
leaves
the
bureau
of
land
management
discretion
to
decide
how
to
achieve
that
object.
the
second
claim
is
that
the
blm
failed
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
its
own
land
use
plans.
a
land
use
plan
however
is
a
tool
to
project
present
and
future
use,
just
one
step
in
the
overall
process
of
managing
public
land.
unlike
a
specific
statutory
command
require
an
agency
too,
for
example,
promulgate
regulations
by
a
certain
day.
a
land
use
plan
guides
and
restrains
actions,
but
in
general
does
not
prescribe
them.
the
land
use
plan
statement
at
issue
here
are
not
a
legally
binding
commitment
enforceable
under
section
706.
we
also
reject
respondent’s
third
contention
regarding
blm’s
fulfillment
of
purported
obligations
under
nepa,
the
national
environment
policy
act,
to
take
a
so-called
hard
look
at
whether
it
must
supplement
certain
of
its
environmental
impact
statements
in
light
of
evidence
of
increased
off
road
vehicle
use.
to
make
a
long
story
short,
we
find
that
those
obligations
attached
only
to
proposed
or
yet
to
be
completed
actions
and
that
the
bureau’s
land
use
plans,
once
approved,
are
completed
actions,
giving
rise
to
no
further
supplemental
obligations
under
nepa.
for
these
reasons
and
others
discussed
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
scalia
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
we
hold
that
none
of
the
three
alleged
failures
to
act
can
be
enforced
by
means
of
a
suit
under
7061.
so,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
decision
of
the
court
in
unanimous.
