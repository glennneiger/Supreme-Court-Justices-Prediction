mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
works
very
hard
in
this
case
offering
a...
an
almost
bewildering
variety
of
legal
theories
all
intertwined,
all
intended
to
support
what
ultimately
i
submit
is
an
implausible
proposition,
that
there
exists
a
category
of
mandatory,
clear
statutory
duties
imposed
by
congress
on
the
federal
agencies
which
remain
totally
unenforceable
by
the
courts,
unless
and
until
the
agency
chooses
to
engage
in
some
affirmative--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no.
this
is
an
entirely
plan-based
claim
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
our
claim
was
that
this
plan,
read
as
a
whole,
taking
into
account
not
just
this
page
but
the
text
on
page
154
as
well,
was
fairly
read
as
a
binding
commitment
that
they
would
do
this
task
within
a
year.
as
it
turned
out,
they
did
it
in
12
years.
they
did
it
in...
in
2003.
they
finally
designated
these
routes,
which
they
said
they
needed
to
do
in
their
exercise--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
they
had
said
that
they
were
going
to
do
it
in
12
years,
we
wouldn't
have
had
any
claim
that
they
were
doing
it
too
late.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and
the
statutory
argument
is
that
the
statute
itself
requires
them
to
manage
these
lands
in
accordance
with
their
own
plans.
that's--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--not
in...
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
there...
i'm
sure
there
are
other
provisions
that
were
required
in
this
case.
but
there
are
two...
there
are
several
different
kinds
of
mandates
that
we're
trying
to
enforce
here:
the
statutory
mandate
under...
of
nonimpairment,
the...
the
requirement
that
they
abide
by
their
own
plans,
and
also
the
nepa
requirement
that
they
take
a
hard
look
at...
at
the
environmental
impact
statement
requirement
when...
when
new
information
comes
in.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
what
makes
their...
their
position
implausible
is
what
congress
actually
did
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
where
it
very
specifically
said
that...
that
courts
have
the
power
to
compel
agency
action
unlawfully
withheld
and
unreasonably
delayed.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and...
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
the
concept
that
decides
who
gets
to
bring
the
lawsuit
is
the
concept
of
standing,
not
the
concept
of
individual
rights.
and
it's
no...
there
is
no
argument
here
that
the
plaintiffs
lacked
standing
under
this
court's
decisions
to
enforce
this
mandatory
obligation
of
the
agencies
to
avoid
impairment.
and
so
i
think
that
that's
the
right
way
to
think
about
it.
and
if
you
look
at
the...
the
finality
concept
and
the
right
role
it
should
be
playing
here,
it's
the
inaction
that
has
to
be
final,
not
the
action
that
you're
seeking
to
compel.
it's...
their...
their
reading
of
the
statutory
text
puts
the
word
final
in
the
wrong
section.
finality
comes
up
under
section
704
which
says
final
agency
action
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
agency
action,
in
turn,
is
defined
as
including
failure
to
act.
so
as
the
courts,
since
the
apa
has...
was
first
brought
out,
have
consistently
said
you
look
at
whether
the
inaction
is
sufficiently
final
to
decide
this
is
the
right
time
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
absolutely.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
two
points,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
don't
disagree
that
the
concept
of
harm
is
a
key
part
of
how
you
decide
whether
or
not
the
inaction
is
sufficiently
final
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
we
want
to
look
at
several
things,
whether
the
congress
imposed
a
deadline
or
a
continuous
duty,
as
they
did
here,
whether
there's
irreparable
harm,
whether
the
agency
is
operating
under
a
misunderstanding
of
the
statute
that
is
involved.
the
courts
say
in
those
situations,
the
practical
concept
of
finality
is
used
to
decide
this
inaction
is
sufficiently
serious
that
we're
going
to
allow
review
now.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
your
honor.
there
are
many
things
that
are...
that
are
sufficiently
general
in...
in
the
code
that
they
could
not
be
enforced
under
section
706(1).
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
what
you
do
is
you...
you
apply
the
usual
techniques
of
statutory
construction
and
then
you
look
at
the
second
thing,
which
i
think
it's
important
that
we...
the...
the
court
focus
on
here.
you
look
at
what
the
agency
regulations
say
the
statute
means.
and
here
we
have
two
features
of
the
regulations
which
the
government
studiously
ignores.
one
specifically
deals
with
how
you
tell
that
off-road
vehicles
are
impairing
and
the
regulation...
the...
the
interim
management
plan
that
they
promulgated...
and
that's
at
pages
71
and
72
of
the
joint
appendix...
specifically
says
that
any
use
of
off-road
vehicles
off
the
existing
ways
that
existed
in
1980
when
they
designated
these
study
areas,
any
use
of
it
is
surface-disturbing
and
is...
is
an
impairment
that
violates
the
impairment
mandate.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
was
promulgated
based
on
notice
and
comment.
it
has
been
treated
by
every
court
that's
ever
looked
at
it
as
a
binding
regulation.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
c.f.r.,
your
honor,
but
it
is...
it
is
a
much
more
than
a
mere--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the...
i
don't
know
the
answer
that
there's
a
specific
rule
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
is
certainly
the...
the
document
by
which
the
blm
has
committed
to
guide
all
of
its
actions
with
respect
to
this
category
of
land,
the
wilderness
study
areas,
and
it's
been
consistently
enforced
by
courts.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
other
regulation
that
i
think
is
important
for
the
court
to
focus
on
is
the
regulation
dealing
with
what
they're
supposed
to
do
when
they
find
impairment
caused
by
off-road
vehicles.
and
this
is
in
the
c.f.r.
it's
at
43
c.f.r.,
section
8341.2(a).
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
it
is
quoted
at...
on
the
top
of
page
5
of
the
other
respondents'
brief,
the
other
red
brief
by
the
utah
shared
access
alliance.
and
i
invite
the
court
to
look
there.
what
the
blm
regulations
say
is
that
when
the
blm
official
on
site
finds
that
off-road
vehicles
are
causing
considerable
adverse
impacts
on
a
list
of
things,
including
wilderness
suitability,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
with
the
wilderness
study
areas,
quote,
the
agency,
quote,
shall
immediately
close
the
areas
affected
to
the
types
of
vehicle
causing
the
adverse
effect
until
the
adverse
effects
are
eliminated
and
measures
implemented
to
prevent
recurrence,
unquote.
so
the...
the
rule
is
if
there's...
if
there's
impairment
being
caused
by
off-road
vehicles,
you
close
it
on
an
emergency
basis
and
then
you
consider
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
take
other
steps
to...
to
deal
with
it
down
the
road
when
you
open
it
up
again.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
the...
the
regulation
not
only
says
that's...
that's
what
you...
that's
what
triggers
it,
but
then
it
says
specifically
what
they're
supposed
to
do,
which
is
to
close
the
whole
area,
including
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
right.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
and
i
think,
you
know,
in
the
real
world,
you
bring
a
suit
and
you
say
here's
how...
the
statute
says
don't
allow
any
impairment.
so
it's
a
very...
reasonably
specific
statutory
mandate.
you
have
a
regulation
that
says
here's
how
you
find
impairment,
and
you
have
a
regulation
that
says
when
there's
a
considerable
amount
of
impairment,
here's
exactly
what
you
have
to
do
to
fix
it.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
there
is
no
procedure
that
the
blm
has
for
filing
a
petition
or
for
doing
anything
to
trigger
any
kind
of
a
response.
there
is
no
process
of
that
sort.
the
most
that
you
can
do
is...
and
we
did
this.
they...
the
letters
are
in
the
appendix
to
the
opposition
to
cert...
is
write
a
letter
to
the
local
field
office.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
there
is
no
place
to
go
get
a
docket
number
and
get
any
answer.
you
send
these
letters
in
and
they
just
sit
on
people's
desks.
and
there's
also
no
requirement--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
those
letters
were
part
of
an
ongoing
effort
over
a
period
of
many
years
to
try
to
get
them
to
take
this
problem.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
we...
we
brought
a
lawsuit
that
encompassed
potentially
a...
a
substantial
number
of
these
different
wilderness
study
areas
and
related
areas,
but
then
what...
what
happened
is
we
made
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
as
to
four
and
put
on
evidence
showing
the
adverse
effects
in
those
four
and
asked
the
court
to...
to
address
them
and
say
they're...
they're
not...
they're
not
adhering
to
their
statutory
and
regulatory
obligations
in
those
four.
the
government
took
the
position
that
even
if
we
had
sued
on
just
one,
that...
and
the
district
court
agreed
with
this...
that
because
it's
an
inaction
case,
no
matter
how
clear
the
statutory
and
regulatory
violation
is,
there's
nothing
that
can
be
done--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but
they
don't
say
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no...
they...
what
the
blm
has
done
instead
over
the...
the
long
period
of
time
is
avoid
doing
either
yes
or
no
and
then
coming
into
court
and
saying
there
is
no
final
agency
action.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well...
well,
perhaps,
your
honor,
but
then
you
end
up
with
an
entire
set
of
litigation
over
how
many...
how
much
time
it
is
before
they
have
to
answer
each
particular
petition
without
any
kind
of
statutory
or
regulatory
guidance
of
how
that
process
is
supposed
to
work.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
it's...
it's
not,
though,
your
honor.
we
were
focusing
on
a
particular
mandate,
a
particular
harm
caused
by
off-road
vehicles
in
particular
places.
and
we're
saying
not
every
shall
phrase
in
the
u.s.
code
can
be
enforced
under
706(1),
but
when
you...
when
it's
very
mandatory,
where
there's
irreparable
harm
and
the
congress
clearly
was
trying
to
preserve
its
prerogative
to
make
these
places
wilderness
areas
by
directing
that
they
be
continuously
managed
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
under--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
it's
not...
it's
not
like
we're
trying
to
take
over
running
the
agency,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
there
is
obviously
going
to
have
to
be
some
application
of
judicial
review
and
then
some
application
of...
of
the
court's
power
to
enforce
the
law.
the
alternative
is
to
say
that
they
can...
they
could
ignore
the
law
indefinitely
and
put
up--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the...
the
evidence
was
quite
clear.
there
really
isn't
any
doubt
about
it.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
indeed,
on...
on
page
59
of
the...
the
appendix
to
the
op
to
cert,
the
government
flat
admitted
that
there
had
been
impairment.
it
wasn't
like
they
were
ignoring
that
fact.
it's
the...
this
is
a
request
for
admission.
we
said
admit
that
there's
been
impairment
in
the
wilderness
study
areas.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
that's
what
this
suit
was.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
that's
the
only
part
that's
before
the
court
on
that
issue.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
we're
not--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--at
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
brought,
there
was
no
blm
plan
or--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it
depends
on
whether
you
mean
now
or--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
difficulty,
your
honor,
is
that
after
the
lawsuit
was
brought
and
as
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing
was
about
to
convene,
the
government
started
exercising
the
exact
emergency--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--when
the
case
was
brought,
there
was
no
closure
order
in
place,
and
we
were
told
by
the
district
court
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
to
require
that.
as
we
were
going
through
that
process,
these
closures
started
to
happen.
and
so
i'm...
i'm
having
difficulty
answering
your
question--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
we...
we
want
an
exercise
of
the
emergency
closure
which
would
effectively
amount
to
the
same
thing.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
if
i
could
refer
you
to
page
52
of
the
appendix
to
our
opposition
to
cert...
that's
the
orange
document
i
guess...
this
is
what
we
did
file
with
them,
seeking
the
closure
of
these
wsa's.
this
is
the...
we're
looking
for
the
orange
op
cert,
your
honor,
not
the...
the
joint
appendix.
and
52
is
an
example
of
what
was
done
in
the
effort
to
get
the
blm
to
act
on...
in...
in
accordance
with
its
own
statutory
and
regulatory
obligations.
and
it
says,
we
just
wanted
to
point
out
to
you
there's
all
this
irreparable
harm
going
on.
there's
orv's
rampant
in
these
wilderness
areas,
and
as
you
well
know...
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
first
paragraph...
43
c.f.r.,
section
8341.2...
that's
the
one
i
was
talking
about
before...
directs
blm
managers
to
immediately
close
areas
suffering
considerable
adverse
effects
from
orv
use
and
abuse.
so
we
brought
it
to
the
agency's
attention,
and
they,
as...
as
they
have
done
throughout
the
period,
simply
didn't
do
anything.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
this
lawsuit
was
designed
to
ask
them
to
do
that.
the
only
real
things
it
seems
like
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
the
form
of
the
lawsuit
ought
to
have
been
in
the
form
of--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but
it
may
well
be
that
the
court
will
recognize
that
all
agencies
have
to
respond
to
these
things
and
you
can
sue
them.
the...
the
reality
is
blm,
unlike
many
other
parts
of
the
interior
department,
doesn't
have
a
process
for
allowing
you
to
petition
for
an
order
and...
and
have
a
formal
process
for
it
being
adjudicated.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
it
may
well
be
then
that...
that
once
that's
clarified,
that
this
whole
dispute
will...
will
be
a
matter
of
procedural--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
there...
there
is
not
a
lot
of
case
law
about
continuing
supervision.
there
are
plenty
of
cases
out
there
that
say
you
can
direct
them
to
exercise
their
discretion.
and...
and
that's
really
what
we
were--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
really
a
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
lawsuits
that
we're
contemplating
here.
if
we
had
brought
this
case
and
said,
direct
them
to
answer
our
petition
about
why
they're
still
allowing...
they
haven't
exercised
their
emergency
closure
power
in
these
four
places,
they...
they...
the
court
might
have
said,
okay,
tell
them...
i
will
tell
them
to
exercise
their
emergency
closure
power.
they
then
come
back
with
a
thing
that
says,
well,
we
don't
think
that
orv
use
is
so
bad
after
all
and
so
we're
just
not
going
to
do
anything.
and
then
you
bring
a
706(2)
claim,
and
you
have
the
same
basic
issues
being
litigated.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
who
don't
apparently
fall
in
either
category,
your
honor?
[laughter]
let
me...
let
me
touch
a
moment
on
the
land
use
plan
enforcement
aspect
of
it
because
i
think--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
that's
one
of
the
things
they're
worried
about.
they
also
apparently,
until
at
least
this
morning,
wanted
to
be
able
to
write
up
these
plans,
go
through
a
whole
public
planning
process,
coordinate
with
the
states,
do
an
environmental
impact
statement,
all
of
this
stuff
in
the
planning
process
and
then
say,
the
plan,
by...
by
the
way,
is
never
enforceable
if
we
don't
do
what
we
say
we're
going
to
do.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no.
the
rule
would
be--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
rule
would
be
they
have
to
go
through
the
amendment
process,
and
there...
then
you
have
an
agency
action
which
you
can
challenge.
their
position
is
we
don't
want
to
do
the
amendment
process
because
then
we'll
have
to
answer
to
all
these
people
in
public
hearings.
we
don't
have
to
have...
take
any
action
because
then
you'll
just
go
to
court
and
sue
us
under
706(2).
we
would
rather
than
amend
it...
and
maybe
we'd
have
to
do
another
environmental
impact
statement,
et
cetera.
we
would
rather
just
ignore
it
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
way
that
that
gets
handled
in
the...
in
the
run
of
the
mine
cases
in...
in
the
d.c.
circuit
and
elsewhere
is
at
the...
at
the
point
of
equitable
discretion.
one
of
the
cases
we
cite,
barr
laboratories,
is
a
case
where
somebody
tried
to
say
you've
got
to
approve
my
generic
drug
within
60
days
because
that's
what
the
statute
says,
and
the
d.c.
circuit
said,
well,
we
have
jurisdiction
under
that,
under
706(1),
but
we're
not
going
to
order
that
because
there
are
16
other
drugs
over
there
that
are
in
the
same
situation.
they
don't
have
the
capacity
to
get
this
done,
and
we're
not
going
to
put
them
at
the
head
of
the
line
because
they
brought
the
lawsuit
first.
the
courts
do
have
a
lot
of
power
in
considering
things
like
finality
and
then
deciding
about
what
kind
of
equitable
discretion
to
exercise...
and
the
d.c.
circuit
case
law
is
quite
sophisticated
on
this
subject...
to
decide
whether
they
want
to
enforce
in
the
way
that
is
being
requested.
all
we're
saying
is
if
there's
a
duty
under
the
statute
or
under
the...
the
plan,
the
plan
isn't
amended,
it
ought
to
be
something
that
you
can
get
into
court
and
let
the
judge
look
at
and
decide
whether
this
is
an
appropriate
duty
to
enforce
at
this
time.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
they...
they
may
well
be...
put
that...
that
argument
forward,
if
and
when
we
ever
have
a
hearing
on
this
thing.
we
were
dismissed
at
the...
the
jurisdictional
stage
here.
they
call
it
jurisdiction.
it
may
well
be
cause
of
action.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
duty
at
issue
and
the
kinds
of
harms
that
are
at
issue.
here
we
have
a
specific
mandate
that
says
maintain
these
places
which
you,
blm,
has...
have
designated
so
congress
will
have
the
prerogative
to
make
the
wilderness
areas
when
it
looks
at
it.
it's...
it's
got
a
very
clear,
specific
duty
and
severe
irreparable
harm
that
will
happen
if
the
blm
doesn't
make
it
a
priority.
in
those
situations,
the
federal
courts
are
much
more
likely
to
say
we
are
going
to
grant
some
relief
in
this...
we
are
going
to
force
the
blm,
or
whoever
it
is,
to
follow
the
statutory
obligations.
in
many
other
kinds
of
situations,
when
the
agency
comes
in
and
says,
well,
we
have
66
other
things
like
this
we
should
be
doing,
the
courts
are
much
less
likely
to
do
that.
we're
just
saying
that
there
has
to
be
a
power
in
the
federal
courts
at
some
point
to
compel
adherence
to
the
law
when
all
of
the
other
requirements
are
set,
standing,
finality,
a
clear
mandatory
duty
which
is
perhaps
better
defined
in
the
regulations,
as
you
have
here,
all
of
these
things,
that
if
you
don't
have
the...
the
residual
power
in
the
courts
to
take
action
at
some
point
when
the
violation
gets
sufficiently
serious
and
harmful,
then
the...
the
provision
really
isn't
enforceable
at
all.
that...
that's
the
main
point
we're
trying
to
make
here,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
that's
a
perfect
example,
your
honor,
of
why
this
issue
only
arises
in
certain
narrow
circumstances
because
the
fcc
takes
affirmative
agency
actions
all
the
time
and
you
can
challenge
those
as
being
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
outside
the
statutory
requirements.
the
difficulty
we
were
facing
here
was
the
absence
of
any
action
to
challenge.
the
agency
was
using
its
own
inaction
as
its
defense
to
being
challenged
for...
for
violating
the
statute.
that's
their...
their
ultimate
purpose.
i--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
and...
and
the...
the
drafters
of
the
apa
really
did
say
we
think
inaction
is
sometimes
action
and
that
that
can
be
final
enough
that
you
can
challenge
it.
and
so...
so
we
think
that's
what
the
court
said
and
that's
what
they
have
done
for
the
last
50
years
under
the
apa.
they've
looked
at
is
this
inaction
sufficiently
serious,
sufficiently
unlawful
that
we're
going
to
allow
a
706(1)
kind
of
claim
to
proceed.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
i'm
actually
not
aware
of
an
inaction
case
in
this
court.
