mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
respondents
could
bring
this
suit
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
challenge
the
bureau
of
land
management's
ongoing
management
of
vast
tracts
of
public
land
in
utah
divorced
from
any
specifically
identifiable
agency
action
that
blm
had
taken
or
that
blm
was
obligated
to
take
but
had
not.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
section
706(1)
of
the
apa
which
authorizes
a
court
to
compel
agency
action
unlawfully
withheld
or
unreasonably
delayed.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
contrary
to
the
text
of
706(1)
which
is
limited
to
compelling
agency
action,
not
ongoing
agency
conduct.
it
is
contrary
to
the
roots
of
706(1)
in
mandamus,
which
has
historically
been
limited
to
the
performance...
compelling
the
performance
of
what
this
court
termed
in
its
seminal
kendall
decision
precise
and
definite
acts.
it
is
contrary
to
the
apa's
generally
applicable
limitation
of
judicial
review
to
final
agency
action,
not
the
sort
of
evaluation
and
planning
activities
at
issue
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
you're
describing,
either
regulations
or,
for
example,
a
land
management
plan--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--of
the
sort
at
issue
here...
we...
we
agree
that
that
is
final
agency
action.
not...
not
everything
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
non-final,
but
for
example,
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--just
because
something
is
final
agency
action
doesn't
mean
it's
ripe
for
judicial
review.
and
that...
that's
basically
what
this
court
held
in
the
ohio
forestry
case
where
it
was
a
challenge
to
a
comparable
general
land
use
plan
that
the
forest
service
had
promulgated.
the
plan
itself
was
final
agency
action,
but
the
court
said
it
was
not
ripe
for
judicial
review
because
it
did
not
have
any
immediate
consequences
on
the
behavior...
behavior
of
persons.
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
allowed
706(1)
to
be
used
to
compel
certain
conduct
that
is
certainly
not...
probably
not
even
agency
action,
but
certainly
not
final
agency
action,
for
example,
monitoring.
some
of
these
plans
contemplated
that...
that
blm
personnel
would...
would
go
out
and
monitor
various
activities,
not
surprisingly
in...
in
the
vast
tracts
of
land,
and
the
court
said
that
that
could
be
compelled
under
706(1).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
well,
the...
the
latter
one
you
mentioned,
the...
is...
is
the
monitoring
activity
that
i
was...
that
i
was
referring
to.
and
there...
there...
the...
the
land
management
plan...
or
excuse
me...
a...
an
off-road
vehicle
plan
for
the
henry
mountain
area
identified
a
particular
area
as
something...
an...
an
area
of
possible
concern
that
blm
was
expected
to
monitor.
a
36,000-acre
area
i...
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
to...
to
monitor
and
to...
and
then
it
contemplated
that
the
area
might
be
closed
if
the
monitoring
showed
adverse
consequences.
the...
the
plan
did
not
commit
a
formal
study,
but
in
any
event
a
study.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it...
someone
from
the
blm
office
would
go
out
to
the
area
to
look
to
see
whether
there's
been
an
increase
in,
let's
say,
off-road
vehicle
use,
to...
to
inspect
whether
there's
been
additional
adverse
consequences,
to
see...
to
perhaps
watch
how
people
are
using
the
area.
and
that's
typical
oversight
and...
and
law
enforcement
type
activity
that...
that
is...
is
not
normally
something
that
a
private
person
could--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that...
that's
not
actually
a...
a
formal
rulemaking.
and
what...
what
the...
what
the
plan,
the
resource
management
plan,
for
the
san
rafael
area
contemplated
was...
was
a
whole
chart
of
activities
that
the
blm
intended
to
do
into
the
future.
the...
flpma,
the
statute
at
issue
here,
identifies
resource
management
plans
as
designed
to
project
present
and
future
uses.
project,
and
that...
that
means
laying
out
a
general
schedule,
but
the
agency
is
not
thereby
imposing
on
itself
a
mandatory
duty
that
is
enforceable
by
any
member
of
the
public
to
require
it
to
adhere
to
its
schedule.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
with...
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
actions
under
the
plan
here,
which
i
should
emphasize
are
just
one
minor
aspect
of
the
broader
challenge
here--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
those
are...
those
are--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they...
they
have
and
what...
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
based
on
a
provision
of
flpma,
which
says
that
management
actions
shall
be
in
conformity
with
the
land
use
plan,
that
that
statutory
provision
obligates
the
bureau
of
land
management
to
carry
out
every
activity
identified
in
the
plan.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
a
statutory
provision.
and
that
statutory
provision
is
inapplicable
here.
what
that
statutory
provision
means
is
that
any
future
site-specific
activities
that
blm
authorizes
have
to
be
consistent
with
general
standards
in
the
plan,
but
it...
but
it
does...
in
other
words,
the
standards
set
the
outer
boundaries
for
what
will
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
these...
these--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
land...
a
land
management
plan
is
something
quite
different
from
a
regulation.
a...
a
land
management
plan
is...
is
an
identification
by
the
agency
of
how...
how
it
expects
things
to
unfold,
again
to
project
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
future.
it
is
not
imposing
on
itself
a
legally
binding
obligation
that
is
in
turn
enforceable
by
any
private
party.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
i
think
it
is
the
plaintiff's
burden
under
a
suit...
in
a
suit
under
706(1)
to
establish
that
there
is
discrete
agency
action
that
has...
that
is...
that
the
agency
is
obligated
to
the
plaintiff
to
take
and
has
not
taken.
that
is
part
of
the
plaintiff's
burden.
and
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
we
didn't
join
the
motion
to
dismiss
but
all
of
the
arguments,
as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
the
arguments
that...
that
we're
making
here
and
that
the
intervenor
made
in
the
motion
to
dismiss,
were
made
in...
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
which
came
along
at...
at
the
same
stage.
and
the
district
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but
it
also...
it...
it
went
to
whether
the
district
court
should
enter
a
preliminary
injunction
in
the
first...
if...
if
there
was
no
basis
under
706(1)
for
the
court
to
entertain
the
case,
that
would
certainly
be
a
basis
for
denying
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
it's...
the
cause
of
action
does
not
lie
under
706(1)--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
the...
the
district--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
district
court
termed
it
jurisdiction,
but
it...
but
it...
it
i
think
probably
more
accurately
would
be
characterized
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
because
there
was
no
final
agency
action
that
blm
was
obligated,
owed
a
duty
to
the
private
plaintiffs
to
take
under
its
land
management
plans.
land
management--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we're...
we're
not
saying
it
would
be
legally
impossible
for
blm
to
impose
such
a
thing
on
itself,
but
blm
has
never--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it...
it
might
be,
but
that
would
depend
on
how
the
plan...
the
particular
plan
was
worded.
but
blm
has
never
understood
the
plans
that
it
is...
that
is
has
adopted
here
to
be
imposing
on
itself
legal
duties
that
it
owes
to
the
public.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but...
but
if
i
could
explain
the
way
that
would
operate.
some
plans
adopt
standards
against
which
future
agency
actions
are
to
be
measured.
for...
to
use
an
example,
suppose
a
forest
plan
said
that
there
couldn't
be
any
timber
harvesting.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
blm
could
not...
or
the
forest
service
could
not
allow
timber
harvesting
within
200
feet
of
a
stream.
and
then
a
particular
timber
sale
came
along
in
which
the
forest
service
was
allowing
trees
to
be
harvested
within
200
feet
of
the
stream.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the...
the
protect
the
stream
would
be
a
standard
against
which
a
timber
sale,
a
discrete
agency
action,
that
takes
place
on
the
land
governed
by
the
plans,
would
be
measured,
but
it
is
not
itself
a
legal
duty
of
the
sort
that
is
compelled
under...
that
can
be
compelled
under
706(1).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
with
respect
to
monitoring--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
not
final
agency
action.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there...
there
are
two
points.
one
is
that
the
plans
as
a
general
matter
do
not
impose
legally...
legal
obligations
that
are
owed
to
members
of
the
public.
they're
internal
documents.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what...
what
i
would
acknowledge
would
be
that
if
blm
chose
in
the
future
to
adopt
a
policy
of
putting
such
things
in
plans,
it
would
probably
have
the
authority
to
do
so.
but
it
has
not
done
that
to
date.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
respect
to
monitoring,
that's
true.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
across
the
board.
with
respect
to
monitoring,
yes,
but
if
they
obligated
themselves
to,
say,
within...
within
1
year
we
shall
issue
an
order
closing
the
back
40,000
acres
to
off-road
vehicle
use
and
we
intend
that
to
be
a
binding
obligation,
enforceable
by
private
parties,
that
would
be
enforceable
because
the
order
closing
the
area
would
be
final
agency
action.
it
would
carry
legal
consequences
for
private
people.
but
monitoring--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
monitoring
itself
is
not
final
agency
action.
it
has
no...
it
carries
no
legal
consequences.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
basically
our
position.
again,
the...
the
plans
can
set
outer
limits
of
what's
permissible,
standards
against
which
future
agency
actions
can
be
measured.
but
within
that
area,
all
blm
has
done
is
project
what
it
intends
to
use...
to
do.
if
i
could
call
the
court's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
that
would
be...
that
would
be
a...
because
blm
would
have
intended
to
impose
on
itself
a
legal...
a
legally
binding
standard.
i'm
not
saying
that
it...
that
it
always
is.
what
i'm
saying
is
if
blm
inserted
such
a
thing
in
a
plan,
that
could
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i...
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i
think
with
future
management
activities,
it's...
i...
the
general
rule,
certainly
i
think
the
universal
rule,
is
that
those
are
aspirational.
if
there
are
legal
standards
that
future
agency
actions
have
to
comply
with,
those
would
ordinarily
be
binding.
i
think
those
are
the
two
presumptive
rules.
and
if
i
could
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
159
of
the
joint
appendix
which
sets
out
the
relevant
portion
of
the
san
rafael
land
management
plan,
at
the
top
of
page
159
it
describes...
there's
a
heading
to
a
chart
that
then
follows.
and
that
heading
is
management
objective.
and
then
there's
table
19
which
sets...
which
is
entitled
anticipated
implementation
and
monitoring
of
plan
decisions.
and
then
it
lists
a
number
of
pages
of
management
objectives
that
blm
intends
to
carry
out.
and
the
particular
one
at
issue
here
is
on
page
162
about
halfway
down
the
page,
rather
cryptically
referring
to
apply
orv
designations,
document
through
an
orv
implementation
plan.
within
1
year
is
the
schedule.
that
is
not
the
sort
of
itemization
that
could
be
thought
to
give
rise
to
a
legally
binding
duty.
it's
included
in
a
whole
list
of
activities,
some...
some
that
are...
that
are
part
of
ongoing
activity,
some
that
are...
have
undetermined
due
dates.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what...
no.
what
would...
what
would
happen
in
that
situation...
in
a
lot
of
situations
there
might
be
a
requirement
that...
that
for
a
group
of
that
size,
the
group
obtain
a
permit
to
use
the
land
for
a
gathering
of...
in
excess
of
a
certain
number
of
people.
i'm
not
sure
if
blm
has
a
regulation
like
that.
i
know
the
forest
service
does.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there...
there
are
two
points
to
that.
first,
someone
who...
someone
who
is
concerned
about
this
visitation
by...
by
orv
users,
whoever
may
use
the
land,
could
apply
to
the
agency
for
an
order
closing
the
area
or
prohibiting
the
entry
of
people
into
the
area.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
again--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
the...
if
the
agency
doesn't
respond,
a
suit
could
be
brought
under
706(1)
to
compel
the
agency
to
respond.
once
the
agency
renders
a
decision
on
that,
then
the...
then
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
that
would
be...
that
would
be
a
decision
on
a
discrete
request
for
final
agency
action,
and
at
that
point
a
suit
could
be
brought
under
706(2)
based...
and
this
is
critical...
based
on
the
agency's
application
of
law
to
facts
and
the
agency's
rationale.
it
would
a
traditional
view
of
agency
action.
the
defect...
a
principal
defect
in
this
case
is
that
the
plaintiffs
have
asked
and
the
tenth
circuit
has
ordered
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance
to
hold
a
trial
about
general
activities
on
the
ground
not
divorced...
not...
not
tied
to
any
specific
agency
action
or
decision
based
on
an
administrative
record.
and
we
think
that
this
is
a
recipe
for
chaos.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in...
in
two
of
the
wilderness
study
areas,
in
the
san
rafael
and
in
the
parunuweap,
blm
issued
orders
closing
some
roads
within
those
areas
but
not...
leaving
others
open.
suwa
could
have
appealed
administratively
those
orders
and
it
could
have
then
gone
to
court
if
those
orders
stood.
suwa
has
not
done
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
under
section
706(2)
of
the
apa.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
the
argument
would
have
been
that
it
was...
that
it
would
have
been
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
that
not
to
close
it
would...
would
not
meet
the...
the
general
statutory
standard
that
wilderness
study
areas...
that
the
secretary
shall
manage
wilderness
study
areas
so
as
not
to
impair
their
suitability
for
ultimate
designation
as
wilderness.
they
could
go
into
court
and
say
that
a...
that
the
denial
of
a...
of
our
request
to
close
the
area
entirely
will...
will
cause
the
agency
not
to
meet
that
legal
standard.
now,
if
there
was
not
already
an
order
that
had
been
issued,
as
there
was
there,
then
what...
then
the
proper
procedure
would
be
for
the
parties
to
present
their
request
to
the
agency
in
the
first
instance
so
that
the
agency
can
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
to
close
it
or
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
one
of
our
arguments.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
i...
i
think
it
would
not
be.
it...
there
may
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--congress
could
impose
a
duty
on
an
agency
to
do
a
number
of
things
that
would
not,
in
turn,
constitute
final
agency
action.
not
everything
congress
tells
an
agency
to
do
is
final
agency
action.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
a...
a
failure
to
act--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
a
rule
would
be
final
agency
action.
monitoring,
because
it
has
no
legal
consequences,
is
not
final
agency
action.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
we
think
that
706(1)
and
706(2)
have
to
be
read
in
tandem,
that
706(1)--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
the
review
occurs
under
the
apa
and
the
apa
is
limited
to
final
agency
action.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
agency
action
is
used
in
both
706(1)
and
706(2).
section
704
of
the
apa
says...
limits
judicial
review
to
final
agency
action,
and
we
think
that
applies
to
both
706(1)
and
706(2).
and
then
finally
the
logic
of
706(2),
as
we
explain
in
the
attorney
general's
memorandum,
which
court
has
given
deference
to,
particularly
the
safeway
stores
case,
explains
that
the
authority
of
a
court
to
compel
an
agency
to
get
on
with
it
and
to
issue
final
agency
action
is
essentially
derivative
of
its
ultimate
authority
to
review
the
final
agency
action
when
it's
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
that
this
case
is
really
controlled
by
lujan
v.
national
wildlife
federation,
which
really
was
the
mirror
image
of
this
case.
it
was
a
situation
in
which
plaintiffs
sought
to
challenge
again
conduct
of
blm
on
a
programmatic
basis,
saying
that
blm,
with
respect
to
vast
tracts
of
land,
had
not
taken
action
that...
that
the
plaintiffs
thought
it
should
take.
and
this
court
held
that,
no,
such
a
suit
must
focus
on
not
only
agency
action,
discrete
action,
but
final
agency
action,
and
you
can't
bring
about
wholesale
change
in
an
agency
program
under
706(2).
it
follows,
we
think,
a
fortiori
under
706(1)
that
that
cannot
be
done
because
706(1)
is
essentially
ancillary
to
706(2).
it
is
designed
to
require
the
agency
to
disgorge
final
agency
action
if
it
has
a
legal
obligation
to
do
it
so
that
once
that
final
agency
action
is
issued,
it
can
be
reviewed
under
the
central
provision
of
the
apa,
section
706(2).
706(1)
is
limited
to
compelling
that
sort
of
action
and
putting
the
courts
in
the
position
where
they
can
then
review
final
agency
action
in
the
way
the
administrative
procedure
act
contemplates,
which
is
on
the
basis
of
the
agency's
decision,
the
agency's
finding
of
fact,
its
application
of
law
and
policy
to
fact
and
its
rationale.
so
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
form.
we
think
that
the
difference
between
the
lawsuit
that
plaintiffs
have
brought
and
the
lawsuit
that
the
apa
contemplates
is
critical
to
the
relationship
between
agencies
and
courts
under
the
apa
and
under
the
separation
of
powers
under
the
constitution.
plaintiffs'
vision
would
put
the
courts
in
the
position
in
the
first
instance
of
finding
whether
there's
been
compliance
with
the
statutory
standards.
our
view
and
the
way
the
apa
requires
is
to
submit
a
request
for
a
particular
order
or
regulation,
let
the
agency
act,
and
then
review
that
discrete
controversy.
all
three
of
the
claims
in
this
case
that
the
plaintiffs
have
brought
would
reflect
a
radical
departure
from
that
view.
the
first
is
to
compel
compliance
with
a
general
statutory
standard
to
manage
lands
in
a
particular
way.
management
is
not
agency
action.
it's
like
a
program,
which
this
court
said
in
lujan
could
not
be
reviewed.
the
claim
to
require
nepa
statements
is
independent,
not
tied
to
any
proposed
major
federal
action.
they're
claiming
an
ongoing
duty
to
update
nepa
programs.
and
with
respect
to
the
land
management
program...
plans,
no
court
has
ever
held
since
flpma
was
enacted
and
these
plans
have
been
utilized
that
they
impose
on
blm
a
duty
owed
to
members
of
the
public
to
comply
with
schedules,
tentative,
anticipated
schedules,
as
this
document
says,
of
what
will
be
carried
out
in
the
future.
this
is
not
just
a
question
of
standing
and
zone
of
interest
which
private
people
might
be
able
to
sue.
it's
more
fundamental
than
that.
these
plans
do
not
impose
any
duties
owed
to
any
member
of
the
public
because
they
are
designed
for
internal
management
by
the
agency.
we
are
in
no
way
saying
that
what
blm
does
is
beyond
judicial
review,
but
the
plaintiffs
are
required
to
follow
the
right
procedures.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
52
was
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it...
what
the...
what
the
respondents
did
not
do
was
wait
for
blm
to
respond,
and
in
fact,
in
march
of
2000,
before
the
pi
hearing
was
even
held
in
this
case,
blm
issued
a
closure
order
that
closed
six
out
of
those
seven
orders
and
left...
areas
and
left
one
of
them
open.
and
suwa
never
challenged
that.
justice
o'connor,
you
referred
to
pictures
in
the...
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
those
are
pictures
of
areas
outside
the
wilderness
area
that
are
open
under
the
relevant
land
use
plans
to
off-road
vehicle
usage.
so
there
are
no
restrictions
on
their
use
there.
