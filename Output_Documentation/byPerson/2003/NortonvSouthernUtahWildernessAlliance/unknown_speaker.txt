unknown
speaker
well,
can...
can
we
talk
about
that
for
a
minute?
certainly
an
action
can
be
discrete
and
be
compellable
under
old
mandamus
rules
without
being
final
agency
action
in
the
narrow...
in
the
narrow
sense.
let's
assume
a...
a
requirement
under...
under
the
statute
that
the
agency
promulgate
its
regulations
by
a
certain
date.
okay?
now,
i...
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
constitute
a
failure...
the...
let's
say
these
regulations
are...
are
general
plans
of
the
sort
that
are
at
issue
here
so
that
they
would
not
give
rise
to
any
immediate
right
of
action
in
that
they're
not
final
agency
action.
but
if
the
statute
says
that
the
agency
plan
will
be
promulgated
by
a
certain
date,
wouldn't
there
be
a
cause
of
action
to
require...
you
know,
6
months
after
that
date
the
agency
still
hasn't
come
out
with
the
plan.
wouldn't
there
be
a
cause
of
action
to
compel--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
well,
boy,
i...
i
think
you...
i
think
you're
out
of
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire.
i...
i
think
it's
much
more
useful
to
the
government
to...
to
say
that...
that
a
lawsuit
can't
be
brought
as
soon
as
the
plan
is
adopted,
which
it
could
if
you
call
that
final
agency
action,
than
it
is
to
say
that
the
failure
to
promulgate
it
can
be...
cannot
be
sued
upon
because
the
promulgation
is
not
final
agency
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
this...
the
case
has
sort
of
a
hodgepodge
of
things
in
it.
among
other
things,
there's
a
claim
that
the
land
use
plans
for
san
rafael
mountain
and
henry
mountain
require
certain
very
specific
things,
that
the
land
use
plan,
for
instance,
for
one
commits
the
bureau
of
land
management
to
finish
an
off-road
vehicle
designation
rulemaking
by
1992--
unknown
speaker
--and
another
to
engage
in
a
separate
study
as
a
precursor
to
the
off-road
vehicle
thing.
now,
those
are
very
specific
and
with
time
deadlines
required
apparently
by
rules
of
the
blm?
unknown
speaker
to
make
a
separate
study?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
monitor,
what...
what
does
the
blm
look
for
when
it
monitors
an
area?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
other
one,
that
the
blm
has
to
finish
its
off-road
vehicle
use
designation
rulemaking
by
1992?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
a
defense?
that
is,
they
say
that
what
these
provisions
mean
is
you
promised
to
monitor
this
area
and
you
didn't.
now,
you
don't
think
it
did
mean
that
or
you
think
it...
so
you...
that's
the
defense.
but
suppose
they're
right.
they
say
you
promised
to
promulgate
this
in
1992.
that's
what
it
says,
dah,
dah,
dah,
dah.
and
you...
and...
and
you
say
that
isn't
what
it
says.
fine,
but
if
they're
right
about
what
it
says,
can't
they
bring
an
action
in
court?
unknown
speaker
those
were
the
two
that
i...
i
know--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
those
two?
they
say--
unknown
speaker
--in
black
and
white,
you
said,
dah,
dah,
dah,
and
you
didn't
and...
and
therefore
we
want
to
go
into
court
and
make
sure
you
do.
you...
why
can't
they
go
into
court
and
make
that
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
you
make
a
defense
it
doesn't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
even
if
they're
wrong
about
that,
i
thought
there's
a
basic
principle:
an
agency
has
to
follow
its
own
rules.
unknown
speaker
so
they
say...
they
say
here
is
a
rule.
it
says
i
will
send
monitors.
it
says
i
will
do
this
by
1992.
those
two
things
were
not
done.
therefore,
court,
please
tell
them
to
do
it.
now,
as
to
those
two
things,
are
you
saying
they
have
no
right
to
make
that
claim
in
court?
unknown
speaker
okay.
because.
because
why?
unknown
speaker
but
why...
why
isn't
that
simply
a
defense?
i
mean,
you're...
you're
taking
the
nature
of
the...
of
the
plan
as...
as
being
ultimately
nonbinding,
as
being
precatory
on
the
agency
as...
as
a
jurisdictional
peg
to
say
nobody
can
even
get
into
court
and
claim
that
they
are
not
following
their
own
rule.
and
i...
i
don't
see
how
you
get
from
the
one
point,
i.e.,
the
nature
of
the
plan
as
precatory,
to
the
jurisdictional
point.
unknown
speaker
in
the...
in
the
lower
court,
you
didn't
join
the
motion
to
dismiss.
did
that
have
anything
to
do
with
this
question
we're
discussing
right
now?
unknown
speaker
but
that
would
go
to
the
relief
or...
or
to
the...
whether
they
have
a...
a
claim
for
relief.
it
wouldn't
go
to
a
jurisdictional
question.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
don't
understand
this
discussion
of
jurisdiction.
you're...
you're...
are
you
claiming
that
the
court
couldn't
even
hear
the--
unknown
speaker
--you're
saying
there's
no
cause
of
action.
yes.
unknown
speaker
okay.
we
don't
usually
call
that
lack
of
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
you
acknowledge
they
can
come
into
court.
unknown
speaker
but
the
judge
should
say,
get
out
of
here.
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
no
land
use
management
plan
can
ever
give
rise
to
an
obligation
to
any
portion
of
the
public
to
do
certain
things
that
the
plan
says
will
be
done
by
date
x?
unknown
speaker
if
it
did,
is
it
actionable
possibly?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
acknowledged
that
it...
that
it
imposes
some
legal
duties;
that
is
to
say,
that
if...
if
the
agency
took
action,
took
affirmative
action,
which
would
destroy
its
ability
to
follow
through
on
the
plan,
you
know,
allowed
development
in
a
certain
area
that
the
plan
anticipated
would
be
left
undeveloped,
that
an
injunction
would
lie
for
that.
i
thought
that's...
no?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
suppose...
suppose
it's--
--well,
let
him
answer.
suppose
it
said
you
shall
protect
the
stream.
unknown
speaker
would...
would
you
go
back
to
monitoring
for
a
minute,
which
may
be
easier
to
understand
than
the
plan?
it
may
be
very
difficult.
it
may
be
impossible
as
a
matter
of
legal
standards
to
figure
out
how
much
monitoring
is
enough.
but
what
if
the
agency
in
an
internal
document
says,
we
are
not
going
to
monitor.
nobody
waste
your
time
going
out
there
monitoring.
and
that's
the
claim
that
they
have
refused
to
monitor.
does
that
get
them
into
court?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
not
final
agency
action?
unknown
speaker
so
it...
it's
really
not...
going
back
to
the...
the
earlier
argument
about
the
plan,
what
is
fatal,
it
take
it,
is
not
that
the...
the
duties
are...
are,
in
effect,
precatory
duties
that
they
don't
have
hard-edged
enforcement
features.
the...
what
is
fatal
is
that
regardless
of
what
the
duties
are,
even
their
fulfillment,
would
not
be
final
agency
action.
that's
your
ultimate
point,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
acknowledge
that
they
could,
that
some
details
of
some
plans
could
impose--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
would
still,
i
take
it,
on
your
argument
not
be...
raise
an
issue
of
final
agency
action.
so
there
still
would...
would
be
no
authority
to
order.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
back
to
the
plan.
you
said,
all
right...
in...
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
you
said,
all
right,
they...
they
could,
in
fact,
adopt
provisions
that
are
very
hard-edged
and
have
absolute
requirements.
i
take
it
then
that
even
if
they
did,
your...
your
ultimate
answer
would
be
the
same.
what
they
are
obligating
themselves
to
do
is
not
final
agency
action,
and
therefore
their
refusal
or...
or
failure
to
do
it
would
not
be
the
subject
of
an
affirmative
order.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
wouldn't
a...
a...
the
adoption
of
a
policy
saying
that
we
will
never
monitor
be
final
agency
action
with
respect
to
the
duty
to
monitor?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
the...
judge
mckay
in
the
tenth
circuit,
dissenting
in
the
tenth
circuit,
described
these
land
use
plans
as
aspirational
and
that's
why
he
thought
that
they
weren't
open
to
private
enforcement.
does
that
go
too
far
to...
to
just
to
say
these
plans
are...
are
aspirational?
they're
our
wish
list.
unknown
speaker
could...
could
i
come
back
to
the...
to
the
no
harvesting
timber
within
200...
200
yards
of
a
stream?
you...
you
think
that
that
one
would
be
enforceable
if
a
plan
contained
that
provision.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
does
it
have
to
say?
we...
we
intend
to
be
bound?
how
do
you
decide
which
provisions
of
a
plan
are
promises
and
which
ones
are
aspirations?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--land
use
plans
are
all
aspirations?
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
say
that?
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
were
the
world
convention
of
orv's
and
100,000
people
are
going
to
come
into
the
area.
the
agency
has
no
duty.
it
just
sits
and
goes
out
to
watch
the
race?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
they
have
to
do
that?
i
mean,
justice
kennedy's
question
is
what
if
they
sit
on
their
hands
and
they
do
nothing.
and
your
answer
is,
well,
they
might
do
something.
they
might
require
a
permit.
but
what
if
they
want
to
sit
on
their
hands?
unknown
speaker
okay.
let's
assume...
make
it...
let's
assume
the
agency
says,
no,
or...
or
the
agency
doesn't
do
anything.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't...
doesn't
even
say
i
will
deny
your
order.
it
just
sits
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
response
final?
let's
assume
they
do
respond.
is
that
final
agency
action?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
if
you...
the
complaint
here
was
that
the
agency
wasn't
doing
anything
or
not
enough
about
off-the-road
vehicles.
now,
you
have
explained
that...
this
is
getting
back
into
the
larger
question
and
away
from
the
land
use
plans...
the...
that
this
effort
states
no
claim.
what
could
the
group
have
done?
what
could
the
su...
whatever...
their
concern
about
these
off-the-road
vehicles
and
the
agency
not
controlling
them.
what
could
it
have
done
that
would
enable
them
to
trigger
agency
action
and
then
court
review?
unknown
speaker
relying
on
what?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
mean,
what...
what
provision
of
law
that
would...
would
have
required
them
to
close--
unknown
speaker
--may...
may
i
go
back
to
the
two
specific
things
that
are
described
in
the
papers
here?
one,
the
commitment
to
monitor
a
certain
area
by
a
certain
time.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
would
not
be
actionable
because
monitoring
is
not
final
agency
action.
unknown
speaker
but
is
not
the
duty
to
monitor
final
agency
action?
for
example,
if
the
statute
said
you
must
monitor
this
area
by
january
1992
and
they
did
nothing,
would
that
not
be
final
agency
action
that
could
be
actionable?
if
the
statute
said
it.
unknown
speaker
if
the
statute
required
a
specific
monitoring
and
they
just
didn't
do
it,
that
would
not
be--
unknown
speaker
--what...
what
about
the
failure
to
do
it?
isn't
the
failure
to
do
it
within
the
deadline
actionable?
unknown
speaker
--promulgate
rules
and
they
do
nothing?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it's...
what
congress
is
you
must,
no
matter
what,
promulgate
by
march
10...
it's
exactly
justice
scalia's
question...
1994
this
tentative,
non-reviewable,
never-to-be-reviewed
preliminary
draft
of
a
vague
plan
x.
okay?
[laughter]
and
they
just
don't
do
it.
that's
where
we
started
this
whole
questioning.
now,
i
would
have
thought
there
would
be
review
under
this
provision
if
they
just
didn't
do
it,
even
though
the
thing
they're
supposed
to
promulgate
can
never
be
reviewed.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
don't
agree
with
my
statement.
so
is
there
any
authority
for
what
you've
just
said,
that
if
congress
says
definitely
you
have
to
do
this
by
such
a
date
and
they
don't
do
it,
that's
not
reviewable?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
best
argument
for
your
tandem
point?
you
just
said
we...
we
think
they
should
be
read
in
tandem.
what's
your
best
argument
for
that?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
let's
go
to
the
appendix,
page
162,
which
i
believe
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
tenth
circuit
dealt
with:
apply
orv
designation
documents;
through
orv
implementation,
et
cetera.
the
schedule
says:
within
1
year
after
approval
of
rmp.
now,
there's
no
statutory
deadline
there,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
in...
on
page
162
instead
of
saying
within
1
year,
they
had
said
within
12
years.
would
you
have
had
any
better
case?
or
would
you...
you'd
have
a
worse
case,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
there's
nothing
statutory
in
the
deadline
you're
talking
about.
it's
a
deadline
that...
that
the
blm
sets
for
itself.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
requires
them
to
set
deadlines.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
can
i...
i...
your
opening
statement
was
that
it's
implausible
that
there
should
be
some
duties
upon
agencies
that
are
not
enforceable
in
the
courts.
i
don't
find
that
implausible
at
all.
i...
i
don't
understand
the
role
of
the
courts
to
be
to
oversee
executive
action.
you
have
congressional
oversight
committees
that
do
that.
i
understood
the
role
of
the
courts
to
be
to
vindicate
individual
rights
when
they
have
been
violated.
and
what
the
government
is
saying
here
is
that
no
individual
right
has
been
violated
until
there
has
been
final
agency
action.
final
agency
action
is
what
confers...
it's...
it's
an
action
that
changes
the
law,
that
establishes
requirements.
and
until
that
happens,
there's
no
individual
right.
i'm
not
willing
to
accept
your
proposition
that...
that
the
role
of
courts
is
to
make
sure
that
agencies
tow
the
line.
that's...
that's
the
president's
role.
it's
not
ours
at
all.
unknown
speaker
it's
based...
nobody
thought
that
the
apa
radically
changed
the
course
of...
of
judicial
review
of
administrative
action,
which
had
been
based
on
the
prerogative
writs
such
as
mandamus
and
which
required
an
individual
right
that
had
been
harmed
and...
and
a
mandatory
duty
to
that
individual.
unknown
speaker
and
one
can
violate
the...
the
directives
of
congress
without...
without
harming
any
individual,
and
when
that
happens,
it's
up
to
the
congressional
committees
to
bring
the
agency
back
into
compliance,
not...
not
these
courts.
unknown
speaker
i
think
all
the
government
is
saying
is
that
the
inaction
like
the
action
has
to
be
inaction
which
causes
remediable
harm
to
the
individual.
unknown
speaker
just
as
that
doesn't
happen
with
action
unless
it's
final,
the
government
says
it
doesn't
happen
with
inaction...
with
inaction
unless
what
you're
seeking
to
compel
is
something
that
would
have
conferred
upon
you
something
you
have
a
right
to
have.
unknown
speaker
let's
take
the
federal
communications
commission.
it...
its
obligation
under...
under
its
statute
is
to
regulate
broadcasting
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
you
think
a
lawsuit
could
be
brought
claiming
that,
you
know,
for
lo,
50
years,
the
fcc
has
failed
to
regulate
broadcasting
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
determine
what's
sufficiently
general?
i
think
it's
pretty...
pretty
general.
the
obligations
under
these
statutes
seem
to
me
quite
general.
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
regulation?
you...
you
call
it
a
regulation.
was
it
a
regulation?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
have
to
appear
in
the
c.f.r.
if
the
agency
regards
it
as
a
regulation?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
something
that
just...
just
determines
internal
actions
of
an
agency
is
not...
is
not
regarded
as
a
regulation.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
slightly
more
difficult
than
that?
and
this...
this
raises
a
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you
anyway.
you...
you
said
a
second
ago
if...
if
the
agency
finds,
in
effect,
any
impairment
and
it
doesn't
do
anything,
then...
then
one
can
sue.
but
the
reg
you
just
quoted
referred
to
considerable
adverse
impact.
and
i
guess
my
question
was
going
to
be
let's
assume
we
are
contemplating
a...
a
suit.
what
is
the
criterion
that
one
would
plead
in
the...
in
the
petition
saying
they
failed
to
do
x,
therefore
that
is
tantamount
to
inaction
or
refusal,
therefore
there
should
be
an
order?
what
is
x?
can
we
get
any
clearer
than
considerable
adverse
effect?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
considerable.
unknown
speaker
not...
not
if
there's...
you
know,
one
track
through
the
desert
is
not,
i
presume,
enough.
unknown
speaker
the
criterion
then
that
you'd
plead
is
there
is
considerable.
we
can
prove
considerable.
we
can
prove
they
did
nothing.
therefore,
order--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
i
have
one--
--shouldn't
you
be
required
to
bring
a
petition
to
petition
for
some
specific
action--
unknown
speaker
--before
just
filing
a
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
could...
i
thought
the
land
use
plan
has
the
status
under
the
statute
as
a
rule...
as
a
rule,
and
there
is
a
procedure.
there
must
be
a
procedure
for
making
a
rule.
the
apa
requires
a
procedure.
i
mean,
it
requires
one.
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
wait
for
an
answer.
you
sent
in
your
letters
and
it
wasn't
long
thereafter
that
you
brought
this
suit.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't...
you...
the...
one
difficulty
that
i
have
putting
a
handle
on
it
is...
is
you're
saying,
agency,
overall
you're
not
enforcing
the
statute.
we
want
a
court
order
that
say...
says
enforce
it,
which
looks
to
a
court
quite
different
than
i...
i'm
asking
to
have
this
particular
area
closed,
and
then
the
agency
would
make
a
discrete
ruling
on
that
particular
area.
instead
of
saying
overall
on
these
four...
whatever
it
is...
vast
parcels
of
land,
they're
not
doing
the
job,
so
court,
tell
them
to
do
the
job,
and
then
the
court
is
supposed
to
monitor
that?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
petitioned
for
an
action,
that
is,
you
asked
the
agency
to
close
this
area,
and
they
said
no,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
final
action.
unknown
speaker
then...
then
you
bring
an
action
to
require
them
to
say
yes
or
no.
that
is
the
agency
final
action
that
you
would
be
suing
for.
you
bring
a
suit
saying
we've
asked
this
question.
you've
diddled
around
for
2
years
and
haven't
given
us
an
answer.
we
demand
an
answer
to
this
particular
discrete
question.
you...
you
would
have
had
a
suit
for
that.
unknown
speaker
but
this
seems
in
a
way
like
sort
of
the
shortcut
to
say
we...
we
demand
that
the
blm
comply
with
its
statutory
mandate
and
we
don't
like
the
way
they're
doing
it.
i
mean,
it...
it
seems
almost
that
general.
unknown
speaker
it's
so
hard
for
courts
to
get
into
the
business
of
trying
to
see
if
an
agency
like
this
is
out
there
on
a
day-to-day
basis
doing
what
it
needs
to
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it...
it
sounds
that
way
to
a
certain
extent,
like
kind
of
the
court
taking
over
a
prison
where
they
find
there's
some
defect.
and
what...
what
is
going
to
be
the
role
of
the
tenth
circuit
or
of
district
court
in
utah
if...
if
you
prevail?
if
they...
they
tell
the
agency
to
do
something,
you
claim
the
agency
hasn't
done
it,
they're
back
on
a
contempt
order
like
in
the
district
court
here?
unknown
speaker
or
maybe
some
application
could
be
made
seeking
closure
of
some
areas.
the...
the
exhibits
you
furnished
are
sort
of
devastating.
unknown
speaker
it
looks
pretty
terrible.
unknown
speaker
so
is
there
no
mechanism
whereby
suit
could
be
brought
demanding
that
a
certain
area
be
closed
because
of
the
impairment?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
go...
look,
are
we
supposed
to
concentrate
on
the
four
areas?
unknown
speaker
right,
those
four
areas.
as
to
those
four
areas,
are
you
saying
as
to
one,
two,
three,
or
four,
that
the
land
use
plan
as
it
now
reads
requires
them
to
be
closed
in
part
or
in
whole
and
they're
not
following
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
or
are
you
saying
that
the
land
use
plan
permits
them
in
part
to
be
open,
but
we
want...
we
think
they
should
be
closed?
which
is
it
as
to
each
of
those
four?
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
saying
what
we're
supposed
to
decide.
you're
saying
now
we
can
narrow
it
to
these
four
areas,
and
i
want
to
know
as
to
those
four
areas,
am
i
supposed
to
assume
that
the
land
use
plan
as
in
documents
that
are
there,
as
to
area
one,
two,
three,
or
four,
now
requires
it
to
be
open
or
whatever
you
think
it
should
be
and
you
want
to
change
it
or
that
it's
right.
you
don't
want
to
change
a
word
of
it,
but
they're
not
just
enforcing
it.
which
is
it
as
to
one,
two,
three,
and
four?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
as
we're
supposed
to
decide
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
want
you
to
choose.
i
don't
care
what
you
say.
i
just
want
to
know
how
i'm
supposed
to
decide
the
case.
am
i
supposed
to
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption...
you've
narrowed
it
to
four
areas...
to
area
one.
let's
take
that.
am
i
supposed
to
decide
it
on
the
ground
that
what
you
want
is
you
think
the
land
use
plan
as
written
is
perfect.
you
just
want
them
to
enforce
it.
or
that
you
want
them
to
change
what
it
says
in
those
words
because
you
think
it's
wrong.
that's
all.
i
mean,
you
must
think
one
or
the
other
or
both.
unknown
speaker
that's...
but
i'm
asking
you
how
i
should
decide
it.
as
i
listen
to
you,
you
want
me
to
decide
it
as
it
was
when
the
case
was
brought.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
view.
so
then
as
it
was
when
the
case
was
brought,
what
you
want
is
a
change
in
the
wording
of
the
governing
documents
which
i'm
thinking
of
as
land
use
plan.
yes.
is
that
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
my
question
then...
and
that's
what
i
thought
you
wanted...
is
why
isn't
the
thing
to
do,
if
that's
the
kind
of
relief
you
want,
to
file
a
piece
of
paper
over
at
the
blm
and
say,
we
want
this
document
amended
because
it
seems
to
me
that
this
document
has
the
status
of
a
rule
and
every
agency...
every
agency...
has
a
procedure
through
which
you
can
request
an
amendment
of
a
rule.
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
right
procedure
rather
than
to
come
into
court
and
say
we
want
a
judge
to
do
it
first
in
the
first
instance?
unknown
speaker
so
if
in
fact
this
is
the
equivalent
of
the
kind
of
document
i
said,
then
why
wouldn't
your
lawsuit
be
to
compel
them
to
act
on
this
request
in
a
timely
fashion?
maybe
the
timely
fashion
would
be
in
4
days
if
it's
an
emergency.
but
why
wouldn't
this
lawsuit
be
designed
to
ask
them
to
do
what
you
asked
them
to
do?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
we're
only
talking
about
the
form.
i
agree
with
that.
this
whole
thing
is
about
the
form.
but
they're
trying
to
make
you
go
through
certain
hoops
and
to
some
point,
i...
i
think
the
law
should
give
you
relief,
but
it
has
to
be
through
the
right
form.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
that
to
get
into
court.
the...
you're
guaranteed
judicial
review.
a
person
suffering
legal
wrong
because
of
agency
action
or
adversely
affected
is
entitled
to
judicial
review
thereof.
if
you
write
them
a
letter
and
they
don't
have
any
other
process,
and
they
don't
respond
to
your
letter,
you
can
bring...
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
been
clear.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that
that's
been
unusual.
what
hasn't
been
clear
is
that...
is
that
a
court
can
exercise
continuing
supervision
of
an
agency,
which
is
what
some
of
your
requests
here
would
require.
what's...
you
know,
that...
that
was
never
allowed
before...
before
the
apa
was
enacted
because
the...
the
courts
were
not
allowed
to
issue
injunctions
that
required
continuing
supervision.
and...
and
mandamus
was
a...
a
discrete
act
that...
that
was
required.
what
cases
since
the
apa
would...
would
you...
you
appeal
to
as...
as
showing
the
authority
of
the
courts
to...
to
undertake
continuing
supervision
of
an
agency?
what...
what's
the
best
case
you
have?
unknown
speaker
in
a
discrete
matter.
in
a
discrete
matter,
but
you're...
you're
asking
to
exercise
their
discretion
in
the
management
of
the
forests.
and...
and
that's...
that's...
i
mean,
that's
putting
the...
the
district
judge
in
the
place
of
the...
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
but
this
time
it's
a...
in...
in
a
form
recognizable
to
men,
women,
and
administrative
lawyers.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
totally
just...
because
what
they're
worried
about
is
not
that
you're
trying
to
get
off-road
vehicles
off
the
road
in
certain
areas
like
here,
there,
and
the
other
place.
what
they're
worried
about
is
that
you're
turning
over
to
a
district
judge
the
generalized
job
of
running
the
blm's
orv
program.
and
so
if
you
can
get
it
to
specific
things,
you
destroy
what
they're
worried
about.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
unreasonable?
i
mean,
suppose
they
get
their
budget
cut.
you
know,
these...
these
are
all
internal
documents.
this
is
what
we
plan
to
do,
but
next
year
congress
cuts
their
budget
by
50
percent.
is
a
court
going
to
direct
that
all
of
the
money
that
interior
has
left
has
to
be
devoted
to
your
pet
project--
unknown
speaker
--as
opposed
to,
you
know,
all
of
these
other
things
that
need
the
money
for
it?
unknown
speaker
how...
how
can
they
amend
it?
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
your
plans
shall...
you
know,
given
how
much
money
you
have,
the...
the
forests
will
be
protected.
it
says
you
will
develop
management
plans
for
the
protection
of
the
forests.
period.
and
so,
if
there's
no
money
there,
you
still
have
to
have
the
same
plan.
they
wouldn't
be
able,
when
they
amended
the
rule,
to
say
the
reason
we're
amending
is
we
don't
have
enough
money
to
do
what
ought
to
be
done.
the
plan
would
still
have
to
read
the
same
way.
but...
and
so
if
the
plan
is
enforceable,
you
are
giving
a
court
the
power
to...
to
put
your
preference
right
at
the
head
of
the
line
of
all
the
money
that
the
agency
has
to
spend.
unknown
speaker
and
that
doesn't
seem
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
but
how
could
the
judge
look
at
it
without
knowing
all
the
other
things
that
are
on
the
agency's
table
given
the
limited
resources?
i
thought
the
blm's
answer
here
was
we
realize
that
the
environmental
impact
statement
is
out
of
date,
and
over
a
period
of
years,
we're
going
to
update
those
statements.
but
frankly,
we
haven't
got
the
money
to
do
it
for
every
place
now.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if...
if
we
imagine
coming
into
court,
then
would
everything
that's
on
the
agency's
plate
have
to
be
presented
to
the
court?
unknown
speaker
that
happens
all
the
time
under
statutes.
i
mean,
you
know,
let's
assume
the
fcc
is
not
doing
its
job.
it's
not...
it's
not
indeed,
regulating
broadcasting
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
it's
violating
its
congressional
mandate.
can
you
run
into
court
and
say,
you
know,
make
the
fcc
regulate...
broadcast
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity?
certainly
you
can't.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
one
way
to
characterize
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that
they
require
that
every
inaction
has
some
sort
of
a
mirror
image
in
action?
and
that's
a
little
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
work
with.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
best
case
in
this
court
for
that
proposition
that
inaction
can
become
action?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
about
the
letter
at
page
52
in
the
brief
in
opposition?
unknown
speaker
why...
why
isn't
that
specific
enough?
