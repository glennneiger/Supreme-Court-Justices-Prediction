and
even
if
there
was,
that's
not
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we...
theoretically
we
could
agree
with
you
that
he's
a
participant
and
so
forth
but
still
say
send
it
back
for
the
bankruptcy
issue.
justice

but
no.
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that...
that's
true,
but
we're...
we're
asking
what
his
status
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens

you
don't
just
have
one
person
involved.
isn't
it
correct
you
have
a
corporation
which
is
a
person
and
you
have
a
human
person?
so
there
are
really
two
people
involved.
