justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the...
what
is
that
issue?
because
i
saw
some...
i'm
not
sure
that
we're
talking
about
the
same
issue.
what
is
the
issue
that
you
say
wasn't
addressed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
this
$50,000
wasn't
put
back
until
the
eve
of
bankruptcy
so
even
if...
even
if
we
agreed
with
you
that
yates
can
be
an
employee,
this
$50,000
still
might
constitute
an
unlawful
preference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
have
to
be
a
working
owner?
could
it
be
someone
who
just
owns
shares
and
doesn't
work
in
the
business?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
that
would
be
pretty
far
afield
from
the
word
employee.
i
mean,
one
could
be...
for
example,
did...
did
yates...
he
was
a...
a
working
owner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was...
were
fica
and
futa
taxes
paid
for
his
labor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts--
--but
what
if--
--what...
what
is
the
consequence
of
the
sixth
circuit
decision
on
the
tax
side
of
this
plan?
i
mean,
they
said
for
the...
the
retirement
portion,
it
can't
be
an
erisa...
erisa
plan,
but
would...
would
the
tax
benefits
be
lost
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
keep
stressing
working
for
the
businesses.
what...
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
mr.
holifield
about
suppose
you
have
a
single
shareholder,
100
percent
owner,
but
that
doesn't
work
in
the
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
does
it
have
to
be
one
definition?
certainly
yates
is
an
employer,
but
why
can't
he
also
be
an
employee?
why...
am
i
right
that
you
seem
to
think
it's
got
to
be
one
or
the
other?
it
can't
be
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
he
is
an
employer.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
why
can't
he
be
an
employee
for
this
purpose
just
as
he
is
for
taxes
on
workers
like
social
security
and
unemployment
compensation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
an
issue
that
everyone
agrees
is
open,
that
even...
even
if
he's
classified
as
an
employee,
the
creditors
may
have
priority
over
the
plan
with
respect
to
that
$50,000.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
hadn't...
if
he
hadn't
loaned
any
money
from
the
plan,
then
he
would
be
an
employee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
hadn't
borrowed
any
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
about
partners?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
partner...
say,
there
are
two
partners.
they
could
be
both
employees
and
employers
of
the
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
the
tax
exempt
part
of
the
plan,
that's
okay.
you
agree
with...
i
think
asked
mr.
roberts
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
point
that
would
be
left
over
for
remand,
that
is
in
any
event,
this
was
a...
was
an
unlawful
preference,
was
that
something
that
you
raised
below?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
want
the
$50,000
that
he
paid
back
into
the
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
presents
the
question,
may
the
working
owner
of
a
business
qualify
as
a
participant
in
a
pension
plan
sheltered
by
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974,
familiarly
known
as
erisa?
the
answer
we
hold
is
yes.
provided
that
the
plan
harbors
one
or
more
employees
other
than
the
working
owner
and
his
or
her
spouse,
the
owner
may
participate
in
the
plan
on
equal
terms
with
other
participants.
we
reject
the
position
taken
by
the
courts
below
that
a
working
owner
ranks
only
as
an
employer,
never
also
as
an
employee
for
purposes
of
plan
participation.
enacted
to
protect
employee
benefit
plant
participants
and
their
beneficiary,
erisa
comprises
four
titles.
this
case
concerns
title
i's
definition
and
coverage
provision.
in
particular,
title
i
defines
participant
to
encompass
any
employee
eligible
to
receive
a
benefit
from
an
employee
benefit
plan,
an
employee
circularly
as
any
individual
employed
by
an
employer.
dr.
raymond
yates
was
sole
shareholder
and
president
of
a
professional
medical
care
corporation
that
maintained
a
profit
sharing
plan.
from
the
plan’s
inception,
at
least
one
person
other
than
yates
and
his
wife
participated
in
the
plan.
in
december
1989,
yates
borrowed
$20,000
from
another
pension
plan
that
later
merged
into
the
profit
sharing
plan.
for
nearly
seven
years,
yates
made
not
even
one
of
the
monthly
payments
the
loan
required.
in
november
1996,
just
three
weeks
before
other
creditors
filed
an
involuntary
chapter
7
bankruptcy
petition
against
yates,
he
paid
off
the
loan
in
full
with
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
his
house.
the
bankruptcy
trustee
filed
a
complaint
against
the
profit
sharing
plan
and
yates
as
the
plan’s
trustee
to
recover
the
loan
repayments
for
the
bankruptcy
estate.
awarding
summary
judgment
to
the
bankruptcy
trustee,
the
bankruptcy
court
held
that
the
plan
and
yates
as
trustee
could
not
rely
on
the
anti-alienation
provision
that
every
erisa
sheltered
plan
must
contain
a
provision
that
shields
plan
assets
from
creditor’s
reach.
that
holding
was
dictated
by
sixth
circuit
precedent,
under
which
a
self-employed
owner
may
not
participate
as
an
employee
in
his
company’s
pension
plan
and
thus
it
may
not
involved
erisa's
protection
to
block
creditors
from
reaching
his
investment
in
the
plan.
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
same
ground.
we
granted
certiorari
in
view
of
the
division
of
opinion
among
the
circuits
on
the
question
whether
a
working
owner
may
qualify
as
a
participant
in
an
erisa
protected
plan.
answering
yes,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment.
erisa's
definition
of
the
employee
and
in
turn,
participant,
are
informative
we
therefore
looked
at
other
provisions
of
the
act
for
instruction.
because
erisa's
text
contains
multiple
indications
that
congress
intended
working
owners
to
qualify
as
plan
participants,
we
need
not
resort
to
common
law
to
decide
this
case.
title
i
includes
several
exemptions
from
erisa's
requirements
the
plans
in
which
working
owners
participate.
those
exemptions
would
be
unnecessary
if
working
owners
were
categorically
excluded
from
participating
in
erisa
protected
plans
in
the
first
place.
title
i
also
cross-references
several
internal
revenue
code
provisions
that
plainly
contemplate
the
participation
of
working
owners
intacts
qualified
pension
plan.
other
erisa
titles
are
corroborative
moreover
a
1999
department
of
labor
advisory
opinion
accords
with
our
understanding
of
title
i's
relevant
provisions.
because
yates
failed
to
honor
his
loan’s
monthly
repayment
requirement,
the
following
questions
remain
open
to
be
addressed
on
remand.
first,
did
the
1996
close-to-bankruptcy
loan
repayment
become
part
of
yates'
interest
in
the
profit
sharing
plan
has
ordinarily
shielded
from
the
bankruptcy
estate
under
the
plan’s
entity
alienation
provision?
and
second,
even
if
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
yes,
was
the
repayment
beyond
the
reach
of
the
bankruptcy
trustee’s
power
to
undo
transfers
benefiting
particular
creditors.
both
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
