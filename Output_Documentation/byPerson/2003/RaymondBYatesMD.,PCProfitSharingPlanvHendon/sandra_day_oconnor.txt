mr.
holifield,
i'm
curious
whether
if...
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
the
petitioner
could
be
considered
an
employee
under
erisa,
do
we
have
to
then
go
on
and
address
the
rest
of
this
rather
complicated
question
on
the
alienation
issue
and
so
forth,
or
would
we
remand
on
that?

it
wasn't
dealt
with
below,
was
it?
justice
sandra

o'connor
no.

here
there
were
a
couple
of
other--

--plan
participants
at
all
times?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
do
concede
that
the
department
of
labor
views
it
differently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
shouldn't
that
have
some
weight
in
our
interpretation?
