i
want
to
know...
i
don't
care
what
you're
asking
for.
you
do
not
think
it's
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--he'd
still
be
something
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
get
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
had...
had
he
not
borrowed
the
money,
would
he...
would
he
have
been
employee?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the...
you
know,
you're...
if...
you
can't
be
appealing
to
the
common
law
then
if...
if
we're
going
to
get
the
meaning
of
employee
from
the
common
law.
the
common
law
doesn't
pierce
the
corporate
veil
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
establish
a
corporation
and
there's
the
corporation
and
there's
the
employee.
and
the
fact
that
the
employee
happens
to
be
a
shareholder
of
the
corporation
would
have
no
relevance
at
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
arguing
something
apart
from
common
law,
something
based
on
what?
based
on
the...
the
purposes
of
erisa?
