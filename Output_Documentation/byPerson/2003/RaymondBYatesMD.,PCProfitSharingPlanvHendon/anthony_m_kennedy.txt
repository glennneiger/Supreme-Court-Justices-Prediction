you're...
you're
not
saying
it's
entitled
to
chevron
deference,
just
substantial
weight?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
i
just
have
one
question.
if...
if
we
follow
your
suggestion
for
the
writing
of
the
opinion,
how
do
you
suggest
we
explain
and
cite
clackamas
county?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
look
at
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
he
be
a
participant
in
the
plan
lawfully
under
erisa?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whether
or
not
he
borrowed
money.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
that
was
because
the
statute
was,
we
thought
in
clackamas,
silent
on
the
point,
and
the
government's
argument
is
that
the
statute
is
controlling
here.
