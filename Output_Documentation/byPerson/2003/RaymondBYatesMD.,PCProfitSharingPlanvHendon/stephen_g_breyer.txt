g.

how
does
it
come
in?
i'm...
i'm...
just
if
you
could
clarify.
this
is
a
little--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--complicated
in
my
mind.
but
basically...
so
we
have
all
the
characteristics
of
a
plan.
now,
you
have
to
start
first
by
saying
that
dr.
yates
is
an
employee
of
the
corporation
called
raymond
yates,
p.c.
and
then
it's
not
a
plan,
however,
because
he's...
wait
a
minute.
it's
not
a
plan
unless...
if
there
are
no
employees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
an
owner
is
not
an
employee
for
that
purpose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
we
look
to
see.
there
is
another
one,
and
therefore,
what
section
25103.3
took
away
under
(b)...
under
(c)
it
gave
back
under
(b).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
it
gave
back
because
there
was
somebody
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
step
one
of
that,
we
had
to
say
that
he
was
an
employee
of
the
corporation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
where
does
step
one
come
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we
have
to
say...
we
have
to
find...
we
have
to
first
find
that
he
is
an
employee
and,
in
fact,
these
regs
don't
give
a
definition
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
have
to
appeal
to
the
common
law
to
say
he's...
he's
an
employee
under
common
law
principles
of
the
corporation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
(b)
says...
(c)
says
he
isn't
one
for
purposes
of
erisa,
and
(b)
says
that
really
wrecks
the
whole
thing
unless
there's
somebody
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
how
it
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't
chevron,
but
i
mean,
what
he's
referring
to
is
the
argument
about
the
mysterious
meaning
of
mead,
which
if
you'd
like
to
go
into
it,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
have
udall
v.
tallman,
if
you
want
to
go
into
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
it's
interpreting
its
own
regs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
for
what
purpose?
if
you...
suppose
i
set
up
a
corporation.
i'm
the
sole
shareholder
and
i
enter
into
an
employment
agreement
they
pay
me
$1,000
a
month
and
i'm
called
the
president,
chief
cook
and
bottle
washer,
and
employee.
now,
am
i
not
an
employee
under
the
common
law?
the
common
law,
say,
for
purposes
of
tort,
is
there
not
respondeat
superior
so
that
someone
who
sues
me
can
get
to
the
assets
of
the
corporation
for
purposes
of
liability--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
any
kind?
is
there
any
difference
whether
i
happen
to
be
the
sole
shareholder
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which...
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
what
is
not
in
this
case.
what
is
it
in
general?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
i'm
correct
in
general,
then
what
is
it
about
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
what...
i
thought
erisa
is
to
protect
employees--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let's
say,
other
than
the
owner.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right?
so
we
put
some
of
them
in
the
program,
and
then
erisa
says,
and
by
the
way,
if
you
have
a
program
like
that,
the
owner
can
participate
in
it
too
just
like
an
employee.
so
that
seems
to
be
the
purpose,
to
make
sure
you
have
some
employees,
and
then
if
you
do,
you
let
the
owners
and
the
executives,
everybody
else
involved
can
become
as
participants
if
they're
members
or
former
members
of
the
organization
at
least.
so
if
that's
the
purpose,
how
does
this
defeat
the
purpose?
there
are
some
other
members
and
he
wants
to
participate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
i'm
just
talking
in
terms
of
purposes.
if
you're
talking
in
terms
of
language,
what
they
say
is,
a,
the
common
law
would
have
considered
him
an
employee
of
the
corporation.
b,
we
have
the
tax
code
which
says...
doesn't
happen
to
throw
him
in
as
a
member
or
former
member.
it
says
he's
a
participant
because
it
says
he's
an
employee.
we
have
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
code
which
again
refers
to
him
as
an
employee,
and
then
we
have
the
language
of
the
reg
itself
which
says
he's
not
deemed
an
employee
for
purposes
of
this
section,
words
which
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
if
he
fell...
didn't
fall
within
it
in
the
first
place.
and
then
it
says,
for
purposes
of
this
section,
which
certainly
suggests
that
it
could
mean
just
purposes
of
this
section,
otherwise
he's
in
it.
and
just
to
top
it,
we
have
that's
what
the
labor
department
thinks.
all
right.
now,
that
seems
like
a
pretty
good
set
of
considerations.
