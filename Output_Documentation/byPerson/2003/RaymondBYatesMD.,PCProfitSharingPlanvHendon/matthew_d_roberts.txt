mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
hundreds
of
thousands
of
shareholders,
partners,
and
sole
proprietors
who
work
for
the
businesses
they
own
are
currently
covered
by
benefit
plans
that
also
cover
other
employees.
all
of
those
different
types
of
working
owners
are
participants
subject
to
the
rights
and
remedies
of
erisa,
just
like
the
other
employees
in
the
plans.
and
that's
clear
from
the
text
of
erisa
which
contains
several
partial
exemptions,
which
mr.
holifield
referred
to
some
of,
for
certain
plans
that
cover
working
owners,
and
those
exemptions
presuppose
that
working
owners
may
be
erisa
participants.
in
addition,
working
owners
have
long
been
eligible
to
participate,
along
with
other
employees,
in
pension
plans
qualifying
for
favorable
tax
treatment.
and
erisa
was
intended
to
harmonize
with
those
tax
provisions
and
it
didn't
revoke
the
ability
of
working
owners
to
participate
in
tax
qualified
plans.
coverage
of
working
owners
also
furthers
erisa's
purposes
of
ensuring
that
employee
benefit
plans
are
governed
by
a
single
set
of
regulations,
of
encouraging
plan
creation,
and
of
protecting
plan
participants.
so
there's
no
question
that
the
other
non-owner
employees
that
are
covered
by
plans
that
also
cover
working
owners
are
participants
subject
to
the
rights
and
remedies
of
erisa.
and
if
the
working
owners
in
those
plans
were
not
also
erisa
participants,
they
would
be
subject
to
different
regulations
and
have
different
rights
and
remedies
than
other
employees
in
the
same
plan.
they
might
even
be
prohibited
from
being
covered
by
the
plans
at
all,
and
that
result
would
place
the
coverage
provisions
of
title
i
of
erisa
at
war
with
the
tax
provisions
governing
pension
plans
and
with
the
insurance
provisions
of
title
iv
of
erisa,
both
of
which
cover
plans
in
which
working
owners
participate
along
with
other
employees.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
the...
the...
it's
clear
and
it's
accepted
in
the
opinions
below
that
it
is
a
qualified
plan
for...
for
tax
purposes.
but
it...
there's
a
strong
possibility
that
if...
if
the
working
owner,
dr.
yates,
is
not
an
erisa
participant
under
title
i
of
erisa,
that
title
i
would
prohibit
him
from
being
in
the
plan
at
all,
which
would
be
a
very
anomalous
situation
because
the
tax
code
is
encouraging
him
to
be
in
the
plan
along
with
other
employees.
and
title
i
of
erisa
would
be
prohibiting
what
the
tax
code
encourages,
and
if
it
were
a
defined
benefit
plan,
which
this
one
doesn't
happen
to
be,
it
would
in
fact
be
insured
also
under
title
iv
of
erisa
which
insures
plans
in
which
working
owners
participate
along
with
other
employees.
and
in
addition,
allowing
working
owners
to
participate
along
with
other
employees,
as
i
was
alluding
to
before,
advances
erisa's
purpose
of
encouraging
employee
benefit
plans
because
the
ability
to
participate
themselves
gives
working
owners
an
incentive
to
establish
plans
for
other
workers.
it
also
could
create
economies
of
scale
in
plan
administration
and
investment
and
it
encourages
owners
to
monitor
the
plans
to
ensure
that
they're
well
managed
and
that
they're
well
funded.
so
for
all
of
those
reasons,
the
department
of
labor
has
issued
the
advisory
opinion
stating
that
owners
can
be
participants
in
erisa
plans.
the
irs
and
the
pbgc
share
that
view,
and
it's
entitled
to
substantial
weight.
the...
the
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
contrary
conclusion
is
it
misread
the
regulation
that
justice
breyer
was
discussing
with
mr.
holifield
earlier.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
skidmore
deference,
your
honor,
on
the
interpretive
letter,
although--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no.
we
don't
think
you
need
any
deference,
your
honor.
the
one
point
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i...
i
have
no
desire
for--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we're
not
asking...
we're
not
asking
for
chevron
deference.
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
we
think
that
it's--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we
read
mead
to
say
ordinarily...
particularly
since
in
christianson,
the
court
was
confronting
an
opinion
letter
from
the
department
of
labor,
i
would
hesitate
to
suggest
that
an
opinion
letter
from
the
department
of
labor
here
and
a
statute
that
is,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
no
different
in
how
it
treats
opinion
letters,
would
be
entitled
to
greater
deference
than--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
a
different...
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
question...
on
the
question
of
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
her
regulation
as
to
limit
the
definition
of
employee
to
only
the
regulation
itself
and
to
not
extend
to
the
statute,
on
that
point
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
her
own
regulation
is
controlling.
that
would
be
udall,
auer
v.
robbins,
which
is
also
a
labor
department
case.
and
i
think
there's
no
question
about
that
as
well.
one
point
i
did
want
to
make
is
that
we
would
urge
the
court
to
make
clear
in
its
opinion
that
all
types
of
working
owners,
not
just
those
that
are
common
law
employees,
are...
are
eligible
to
be
participants
under
erisa.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there's
confusion
on
that
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
very
reasons...
same
reasons
that
justify
the
conclusion
that
sole
shareholders
can
be
erisa
participants
also
justify
the
conclusion
that
sole
proprietors
and
partners
who
are
not
common
law
employees,
if
they
are
working
for
the
businesses,
may
be
erisa
participants.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
as
a
general
matter,
i
think
that
person
could
not
be
covered
as
a...
a
participant.
the
person
might
be
designated
by
a
participant
as
a...
as
a
beneficiary
or
in
certain
circumstances
designated
by
the
plan
as
a
beneficiary
in
connection
with
a
participant
in
the
plan
who
was
an...
an
employee.
but
the
definition
of
employee
for
erisa
is
the
same
definition
as
under
401
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
common
law
employees
plus
self-employed
individuals
who
are
people
that
are
providing
personal
services
to
the
business
and
getting
earned
income.
responds
to
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
remanded.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
in...
in
clackamas,
the
court
followed
the
same
approach
that
the
court
followed
in
darden.
and
the
first
step
in
that
approach
is
to
look
to
the
statute.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and
so
we
would
say
clackamas
just
doesn't
come
in
because
you
look
to
the
statute.
the
statute
makes
clear
that
all
the
types
of
working
owners
can
be
covered,
your
honor.
