mr.
c.
mark
troutman
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
we...
we
address
this
issue
at
the
very
level
that
you...
you
talked
about,
that
first
common
law
level,
and
we
think
an
important
distinction
should
be
made
in
this
case
that
this
case
is
not
about
working
owners.
this
case
is
about
one
working
shareholder,
a
sole
shareholder.
and
we
think
that
makes
a
substantial
difference
when
you
get
down
to
the
basics
of
an
organization
and...
and
you
look
at
the
fiduciary
duties
a
president,
a
director
has
to
a
corporation
and
you
look
at
the
fact
that
when
you
have
one
shareholder,
there's
one
person
that
that
duty
is
enforceable
by,
and
that's
the
same
person
that
it
applies
to.
on
the
other
hand,
in
this...
in
this
court's
opinion
in
clackamas,
you
had
four
shareholders,
and
no
matter
what
their
interests
were,
those
shareholders
all
had
fiduciary
rights
and
expectations
between
themselves
and
all
had
the
right
to
enforce
those
fiduciary
obligations
amongst
them.
so
there
is
some
element
of
control
that
those
other
shareholders
have
when...
when
you
try
to
separate
one
down.
but
here,
at
its
basic
level,
dr.
yates
is
controlled
by
no
one.
so
when
you
start
talking
about
common
law
applications
of
master/servant
and
control,
there's
no
one
else
to
apply
it
to.
he
answers
to
no
one
in
this
corporation.
so
we
think--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--there...
there
is.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
well,
we
think
there
is
a
difference--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--in
this
case
because--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--well,
in
general
you're...
you're
correct
that...
that
you
would
be--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--okay.
in
this
case
and
in
the
clackamas
case,
the
court
looked
at
what
the
common
law
considers
an
employee.
and
we
think
when
you
apply
common
law
concepts
of
control
in
a
master/servant
relationship
and
when
you
get
down
to
breaking
down
and
applying
the
elements
that
are
referenced
in
the
darden
case,
that
all
of
these...
all
of
these
elements,
when
you're
applying
them
to
dr.
yates,
will
indicate
that
as
sole
shareholder
he
is
more
considered
an
employer
than
he
is
an
employee.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
we
think
that
when
you
have
sole
shareholders
and
when
you...
and
when
you're
dealing
with
trying
to
apply
a
control
to
only
one,
it's
almost
an
anomaly.
and...
and--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--we
think
that
for
purposes
of
erisa,
when
erisa
is
trying
to
determine
whether
a
person
is
an
employee
and
an
employer
and
where
we're
not
given
much
guidance
by
the
statute,
we
don't
think
these...
number
one,
we
don't
think
these
other
statutory
provisions
give
us
guidance
with
a
sole
shareholder.
and
we
think
a
distinction
should
be
made
within
this
category
of
working
owners
between
sole
proprietors
and...
and
sole
shareholders.
and
so
while
in...
in
the
common
law
context
in
general,
an
employee
may
constitute
or
consist
of
an...
of
a
sole
shareholder,
when...
when
you're
trying
to
separate
that
person
out
under
erisa
and
plug
that
person
into
one
of
those
definitions
under
erisa--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--we
think
under
darden...
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
we
think
under
darden
that
when
you
apply
the
factors
that
are
listed
in
the
darden
case,
the
control,
the...
the
providing
of
the
instrumentalities,
the
right
to
direct
the
work
of
other
employees,
we
think
that
that
results
in
this
instance
with
the
sole
shareholder
of
classifying
him
as
an
employer,
not
an
employee.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
well,
i...
i
guess
under
that...
under
that
scenario
then
we
would
need
to
look
at
perhaps
what
the
employer...
how
the...
how
the
particular
person
is
acting
under
the
plan.
and
if...
if
we're
talking
about
is
he
taking
money
out
of
his
paycheck
and
deduct...
and
contributing
under
erisa,
perhaps
he's
an
employee.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
he...
exercising
his...
his
investment
decisions
as
trustee,
does
he
then
come
under
the
definition
of
employer
as
someone
acting
on
his
behalf?
or
in
this
instance,
we
have
the...
we
have
the
debt
that
existed
for...
for
many
years
and
contrary
to
the
specific
terms
of
the
plan,
that
debt
was
not
repaid
by
a
specific--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--yes,
i
agree
with
that,
but
what
i
was
going...
what
i
was...
what
i
was
leading
to
was
that
when
he
failed
to
make
those
quarterly
deductions
that
are
required
by
the
plan,
he...
that
more
couches
him
in
terms
of
an
employer
because
he's
the...
he's
got
his
employer
hat
on,
in
other
words,
because
he's
the
one
that
would
control
what
deductions
come
out
of
employees'
pay
or
not.
and...
and
we
think
that's
the
very
heart
of
this...
this
case.
and
so
if
he's
acting
in
that
capacity,
perhaps--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--if
he
hadn't
loaned
any
money
in
the
plan--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--borrowed
any
money.
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
it
would
have
been--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--i
understand.
but
now,
there's
also...
we
also
make
the
point
that
perhaps
there
can
be
participation
under
the
plan,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
elevate
him
to
this
protected
status
as
a
participant.
under
the
internal
revenue
provisions,
he
is
permitted
to
participate
under
this
plan,
but
the
irs...
i
mean,
the...
erisa
distinguishes
between
an
employer
and
an
employee
in
those...
in
those
definitions.
so--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--he
could
have
possibly
been
an
employee
insofar
as...
if...
if
under
justice
ginsburg's
scenario,
you
look
at
the
activities
of
the
individual
under
a
specific
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
we
don't
think
so.
we
think
that
he--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--whether
or
not
he
borrowed
money.
our
position
is
that
he
may
have
been
able
to
participate
under
the
plan
under
the
internal
revenue--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--the
department
of
labor
does
view
it
differently.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
we
think
under
the
harris
county
case
that
is
entitled
to
the
respect
to
the
extent
that
it
is
persuasive.
but
again,
the...
the
labor
regulations
refer
to
this
broad
class
of
working
owners,
and
we
think
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
sole
proprietors,
sole
shareholders,
and
these
other
classifications,
for
instance,
the
general
motors
line
employee
who
gets
stock
as
part
of
his
pension
plan.
we
don't
think
that...
you
know,
because
he's
not
able
to
control
his
job,
he's
still
at
the
mercy
of...
of
management.
we
don't
think
that...
that
stock
ownership,
no
matter
how
fractional,
gives
him
any...
any
rights
to
control
or
act
as--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--partners
would
be
the
same
way
we
think
because
obviously
you're
going
to
have
more
than
one
person
if
it's
a
partnership.
but
a
partner,
you
know,
owes
other
fiduciary
duties
and
an
individual
partner
is
always
subject
to
a
fiduciary
duty
to
his
other
partners.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
no.
we
think...
well,
no.
yes,
we
would
agree
that
if
there's
two
or
more,
that
that
distinguishes
the
situation
from
this
case
where
you
have
one
sole
person
involved.
so,
yes,
partners
could
be
employees
and
deemed
participants
under...
under
erisa.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
you
do,
but
you
only
have...
but
that...
that
corporation,
that
legal
fictional
entity,
can
only
act
through
a
human
person,
and
there's
only
one
human
person
to
act.
dr.
yates,
as
president
or
director,
owes
those
fiduciary
duties
to
the
corporation,
but
as
sole
shareholder,
you
know,
in
essence
they're
owed
to
him.
so
he...
there's
no
way
to
enforce
those
back.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
that's
right.
we're
appealing--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--yes,
based
on
the
purposes
of
erisa
and
based
on
this
court's
opinion
in
the
clackamas
case
where...
where
it
looked
beyond
the
corporate
structure
of
the...
of
the
four
shareholders
there.
and...
and
in
the...
in
the
footnote
it
specifically
said
that...
of
course,
we
had
the
eeoc
guidelines
of
control
and...
and
all
the
others,
but...
but
the
court
went
beyond
the
corporate
veil
there
to
say
that
these
four
shareholders
under
the
common
law
may
likely
be
classified
as
employers
than
employee,
at
least
under
the
ada.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
the
government
is
arguing
that
the
statute
is
different
in
the...
from
both
darden
and
clackamas
in
that
it
indicates
that
employees
may...
or
that
working
owners
may
participate.
our
response
to
that
is
two
things.
one,
when
you
break
it
down
to
sole
shareholders
and
go
back
to
the
purposes
of
erisa,
you
know,
the
owners
of
the...
employers
were
not
who
erisa...
congress
was
trying
to
protect.
it
was
the
employees.
secondly,
when
you
look
at
other
provisions
like
the
definition
of
an
employer
that
says
someone
working
on
his...
on
behalf
of
the
employee...
when
you
look
at
sections
1052,
1053
of
erisa
that
clearly
seem
to
distinguish
between
an
employer
and
employee,
we
submit
there
are
other
inferences
that
may
be
drawn
that
perhaps
the
same
person
cannot
function
in
two
different
capacities
under
erisa.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
if
the...
we
submit
that
what
this
doctor...
what
dr.
yates
is
here
as
a
sole
shareholder
is
more
akin
to
an
employer
than
an
employee
and
that
when
you
start
combining
his
interests
with
those
of
other
employees,
that
you
start
to
muddy
the
purpose
of
the
congressional
intent--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--i
understand.
i...
i
would
say
that
under
title
iv,
justice
breyer,
also
the
same
language
is
there:
for
purposes
of
this
section.
then
it
defines
a
substantial
owner.
so
we
submit
the
same
limiting
language
that's
in
the
c.f.r.
is
also
in
the
provisions
of
title
iv,
and...
and
as
the
petitioner
correctly
points
out
in
their
brief,
title
iv
does
not
apply
here.
so
we
think
the
policies
of
erisa
are...
are
furthered
when
you
separate
the
two
and
you...
you
know,
where
congress
has
intended
to...
to
protect
employees,
and
we
think
when
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute
are
examined,
that...
that
this
one
person
cannot
occupy
these
two
positions
of
employer
and
employee.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
you
did,
justice
ginsburg,
and
we
don't
think
there's
any
tax
effect
here
by
this
decision.
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
we
did.
in
fact,
your
honor,
that
was
the
very
first
thing
we
raised
and
that
was
the
first
issue
we
focused
on
and
the...
the
bankruptcy
court
instead
chose
this
issue
to
rule
on
and
pretermitted
the
determination
of
the
other
issue.
we
focused
on
the
exception
under
statutory
section
1144,
that
erisa
is
not
intended
to
preempt
other
federal
laws.
that
decision
was
not
reached
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
we...
we
also
thought
it
important...
we're
not
going
after
dr.
yates'
interest
as
an
employee
in
this
plan.
the...
the
defendants
are
the
plan
administrator
and
the
trustee.
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
our
cause
of
action
is
against
the
recipient,
the
plan,
for
the
repayment
of
the
debt
not
dr.
yates--
mr.
c.
mark
troutman
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
so
for
those
reasons,
we
think
that...
that
clackamas
did
not
limit
us
to
looking
at
the
corporate
structure,
and
we
think
that
erisa
is
considered
to
employees.
and
we
think
the
lower
courts
correctly
ruled
so.
