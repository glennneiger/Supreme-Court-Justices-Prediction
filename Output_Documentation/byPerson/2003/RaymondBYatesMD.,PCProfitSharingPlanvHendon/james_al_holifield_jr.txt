mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
believe
that
a
sole
owner
may
be
a
participant
in
an
employee
benefit
plan
if
another
common
law
employee
participates
in
such
plan,
regardless
of
whether
that
corporation
or
entity
transacts
business
as
a
sole
proprietorship,
partnership,
or
corporation.
this
belief
is
based
on
a
plain
reading
of
erisa,
the
plan
language
in
question
here,
the
statutory
scheme
of
erisa,
the
dol
regulations
and
the
policy
considerations
beside...
excuse
me...
behind
such
regulations.
when
erisa
was
passed,
it
incorporated
the
term
employee.
this
court
dealt
with
that
term
in
nationwide
v.
darden
and
held
that
the
term
employee
includes
a
common
law
employee.
and...
and
the
term
participant
in
a
plan
says
if
you're
an
employee
with
a
right
to
a
benefit,
then
you've
met
the
definition
of
participant.
in
just
looking
at
these
two
terms
alone,
yates
was
a
participant
in
this
plan
and
it's
the
petitioners'
position
as
such
he
had
the
rights
to
enforce
the
rights
of
erisa.
if
you
further
read,
the
terms
of
the
plan
in
and
of
itself
support
this.
this
was
an
irs
prototype
plan
and
the
plan
allowed
for
sole
owners,
sole
proprietors,
partnerships,
or
even
incorporated
entities
to
participate
as
sole
owners
in
the
plan
if
they
covered
other
common
law
employees.
on
top
of
this,
if
you
look
at
the
erisa
statutory
schemes,
when
erisa
was
passed,
title
i
addressed
many
different
concerns.
as
i've
already
explained
the
definition
of
employee
and
participant
specifically
include
the
person
such
as
yates
as
allowing
him
to
participate
because
he
is
an
employee.
furthermore,
if
you
look
at,
for
instance,
erisa
section
1103(b),
that
provision
excludes
as
an
exclusion
for
certain
aspects
to
the
trust
requirements
of
erisa.
one
of
those
specific
exclusions
if...
is
that
some
or
all
employees
are
employees
as
defined
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
a
specific
reference
is
made
to
26
u.s.c.
401(c)(1).
and
so
you...
you
see
a
pattern
here
that
the
irs
code
and
the
erisa
law
being
congruent
in
its
administration
of
plans
and
a
specific
reference
to
a
definition
of
working
employers
that
includes
self-employed
individuals,
partnerships,
and...
and
people
such
as
that.
when
erisa
was
passed,
title
ii
of
erisa
specifically
dealt
with
changes
to
the
tax
code.
it
dealt
with
specifically
amendments
to
code
section
401.
since--
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
--no,
it
wasn't,
your
honor.
and
it...
it's...
certainly
i
could
make
an
argument
here
that
patterson
and
guidry
is
controlling
on
that
matter
of
anti-alienation,
but
that
issue
wasn't
the
particular
issue--
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
--raised
in
this
court,
and...
and
not
addressed
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
the
issue
that
was
not
addressed
in
the
lower
courts
is
there
is
the
maybe
potential
conflict
with
the
bankruptcy
code
as
far
as
preference
laws
and
the
erisa
anti-alienation
provision.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
your
honor,
it...
it
might.
there's
certainly
language,
i
believe,
in
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
and
the
district
court
opinion
that
they
both
held
that
had...
certainly
indicated
it
would
be
dicta
that
had
yates
been
declared
a
participant
in
the
plan,
they
would
have
enforced
the
anti-alienation
provisions,
but
there
was
specific
holding
on
that
point.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
that
is
within
the
prerogative
of
this
court,
your
honor.
when
title
ii
was
enacted,
it
was
enacted
with
the...
an
understanding
that
in
1942
the
revenue
act
of...
was
passed
that
allowed
shareholder
employees
to
participate
in
a
plan.
in
1962,
self-employed
individuals
tax
retirement
act
was
passed
and
that
allowed
sole
proprietors
or
partnerships
to
form
a
keogh
plan
in
which...
and
whether
they
could
participate
in
a
plan
that
only
covered
themselves
or
allowed
that
it
cover
other
employees.
erisa
was
passed
in
'74,
and
it
was
passed
with
an
understanding
that
these
tax
code
provisions
were
there.
when
congress
was
amending
title
ii
of
erisa
to
amend
the
tax
code,
it
did
not
change
any
of
these
definitions.
it
clearly
allowed
these
sole
owners,
these
working
owners,
if
you'll
let
me
call
them
that,
to
participate
in
these
plans
and
had
congress
wanted
to
exclude
them,
they
could
have.
they
knew
how
to
exclude
people.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
possibly,
your
honor.
yes.
i
mean,
that
is...
very
rare
does
that
occur.
typically
you
may
see
that
in
a
group
health
plan,
but
not
typically
in
a
retirement
plan.
you
may
see
those
types
of
things,
but
there's
nothing
to
prevent
that.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
terms
of...
i
think
the
record
is
critical
on
this
that
he's
a
common
law
employee.
the
retirement
plan
in
and
of
itself
defined
compensation
as
w-2
compensation,
which
means
fica
and
futa,
as
you're
inquiring,
was
withheld.
and
so
as
a
w-2
employee,
the
monies
that
were
contributed
to
this
plan
were
based
on
a
percentage
of
his
w-2
compensation.
so
from
a
common
law
standpoint,
just
pure
corporate
law,
he
was
an
employee
of
that
corporation
who
was
handed
a
w-2
as
an
employee
of
the
yates
p.c.,
and
it
was
based
on
that
compensation
that
his
contributions
were
made
to
the
plan.
in
title
iv
of
erisa,
there's
an
exclusion
for
plans
maintained
solely
for
substantial
owners.
and
the
point
i'm
making,
whether
you
look
at
title
i,
title
ii,
or
title
iv,
you
see
references
to
sole
owners
being
in
there
or
not...
possible
ways
they
could
be
excluded,
but
none
of
them
that
would
prevent
them
from
participating
in
plans
such
as
this.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
that,
as
well
as
look
at
the
dol
regulatory
scheme
that
has
come
out
of
this,
the
dol
opinion
letters
before
this
conclusion,
be
that
79-08a
which
is
in
the
record
at
j.a....
the
joint
appendix
at
271
and
273,
the
opinion
letter
99-04a
at
274a
and
283a.
you
see
an
information
letter
that's
actually
is
part
of
unum
providence
brief
at
appendix
1,
and
that's
a
letter
from
robert
dole
to
susan
hoffman.
each
of
these
is
where
the
dol
has
opined
an
opinion
that
people
that
are
working
owners
can
be
a
participant
in
an
employee
benefit
plan.
and
so
i
think
the
case
law
on
that
point
is
pretty
clear.
and
i
think
where
the
confusion
comes
into
play
is
this
definition
of
employee
benefit
plan
in
a
reg
that
has
been
misread
by,
i
believe,
two
circuits
on
that
point.
and
i
think
just
a
plain
reading
of
the
reg
in
and
of
itself
shows
that
working
owners
were
intended
to
be
included
in
these
plans
if
they
had
another
participant
in
the
plan.
and--
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
stipulation
of
facts
point
that...
that
there
were
always
other
participants
in
the
plan
besides
the
working
owner
since
these
plans
were
formed
in
1989.
and
so
just
for
the
policy
reasons
behind
that
is
i
think
the
preambles
to
the
reg
further
shed
light
about
the
definition
of
employee
benefit
plan.
and
what
the
department
of
labor
was
weighing
here
was
do
you
really
want
to
have
working
owners
that
are
the
sole
owners,
sole
participants
of
the
plan,
have
to
comply
with
the
erisa
burdens.
in
other
words,
is
there
a
need
to
tell
the
working
owner,
even
though
there's
no
one
else
in
the
plan,
you
need
to
give
yourself
a
summary
plan
description?
you
need
to
file
an
annual
tax
return
reporting
about
the
plan.
you
need
to
communicate
cobra
rights
for
a
health
plan
to
yourself.
presumably
if
you
created
that
plan,
you
are
in
a
situation
that
you
are
aware
of
the
benefits
of
the
plan.
but
as
soon
as
you
have
one
other
employee,
then
there's
a
necessity
for
you
to
communicate
those
rights
and
benefits
and
explain
the
terms
of
the
plan.
and
that
seems
to
be
a
pretty
reasonable
reading
of
what
the
dol
was
trying
to
balance
here.
in
their
preambles,
they
even
said,
one,
there's
no
reason
to
protect
any
abuse
here,
and
secondly,
that's
not
a
good
use
of
our
resources
to
administer
sole
owner/sole
participant
plans.
and
given
that
background,
i
think
that's
how
that
reg
should
be
read.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
sure.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
correct.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
well,
step
one
is
just
based
on
common
law
and
the
work...
and
that
is
what
this
court
held
in
darden.
if
you
look
at
that,
that--
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
--exactly.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
correct.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at...
what
the...
the
holding
in
the
sixth
circuit,
i
really
think
it
really
creates
some
policy
problems
for
employee
benefit
plans
that
are...
are
pretty
significant.
for
instance,
the
holding
was
that
there
is
an
employee
benefit
plan
here
which...
with
the
issue
you
just
raised.
and
then
it
said,
but
there's
not
a
participant...
yates
is
not
a
participant
in
that
plan.
so
you
have
this...
i
don't
know
what
you
call
it
because
he's
been
under
one
plan
document
since
the
passage
of
the
plan,
since
it
was
enacted,
and
so
now
there's
a
presumption
that
this
aspect
of
the
plan
is
governed
under
state
law,
even
though
there's
never
been
a
provision
provided
such
as
that.
the
plan
document
is
the
same
plan.
and
you
could
very
easily
get
fiduciaries
in
a
situation
like
this
having
inconsistent
state
law
claims
versus
federal
claims.
you
could
end
up
having
situations
that
really
make
no
sense.
and
one
of
the...
the
primary
purposes
of
erisa
was
to
avoid
the
very
issue
that
that
would
cause
and
that
is
they
wanted
a
uniform
administrative
scheme
for
all
of
the
states
and
now
there
will
be,
you
know,
50
states
having
different
regulatory
provisions
regarding
these
plans,
plus
the
federal
regulations.
and
what
if
they
don't
co-exist
in
consistent
remedies?
and
so
i
think
for
those
reasons,
petitioner
is
asking
that
yates
be
declared
a
participant
in
this
plan
and
remand
that
for
further
proceedings.
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
holifield.
mr.
james
al
holifield,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
just...
just
point
out
just
a
couple
quick
points
here,
and
that
is,
there's
nothing
in
erisa
that
prevents
a
person
from
being
or
playing
or
acting
in
multiple
roles.
that
was
contemplated
all
throughout
erisa
and
it's
in
the
briefs.
matter
of
fact,
there's
nothing
preventing
yates
p.c.
from
being
the
trustee,
the
plan
administrator,
the
plan
sponsor,
and
having
all
those
roles.
this
court
in
varity
v.
howe
dealt
with
an
individual
in
one
speech
who
was
part
of
the
time
held
to
be
the
employer,
part
of
the
time
held
to
be
a
fiduciary
communicating
benefits
in
the
same
speech.
so
those
roles
can
happen
simultaneously
in
certain
aspects.
and
so
i
would
point
that
out.
and
the
other
thing
is...
is
the
term
employer.
there's
nothing
preventing
a
person
being
an
employer
and
an
employee.
in
fact,
the
definition
of
employer
says
anyone
acting
as
an
employer,
a
person
acting
as
an
employer,
and
the
definition
of
persons
specifically
includes
individual,
partnerships,
joint
ventures,
corporations,
unincorporated
organizations,
associations,
employee
organizations,
mutual
companies,
this...
this
huge
laundry
list
of
entities,
including
down
to
a
single
person.
so
i'd
argue
that
i
don't
think
there's
a
question
about
a
person
being
an
employer
and
even
if
you
assumed
yates
was
a
sole
proprietor
and
still
being
able
to
participate
in
this
plan
based
on
the
other
regulatory
provisions
and
statutes
of
erisa.
and
for
those
reasons,
we'd
ask
that
you
reverse
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
remand
it
for
further
proceedings.
