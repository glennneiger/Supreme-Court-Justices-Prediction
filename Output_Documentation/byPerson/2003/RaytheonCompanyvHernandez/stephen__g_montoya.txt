mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
the
court
made
it
emphatically
clear
that
there
were
two
predicates
for
its
decision.
one
was
a
traditional
discriminatory
impact
analysis,
what
raytheon's
intent
was
upon
dismissal.
and
this
is
all
very
clear,
reprinted
at
page
12a
and
13a
of
the
appendix.
the
court
says
that
mr.
hernandez
has,
quote,
presented
sufficient
evidence
from
which
a
jury
can
conclude...
could
conclude
that
he
was
qualified
for
the
position
he
sought
in
1994
and
that
is
application
was
rejected
because
of
his
record
of
drug...
drug
addiction.
period.
additionally...
and
then
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
alleged
uniform
practice
is,
in
fact,
valid
under
the
americans
with
disability
act.
so
there
are
two
grounds
for
the
decision.
and
moreover,
because
this
could
be
a
mixed
motive
case,
even
if
this
court
concludes
that
the
alleged
oral
practice
is
valid,
the
case
would
still
have
to
be
remanded
because
you...
even
if
the
employer
had
a
valid
reason
to
terminate
mr.
hernandez,
if
it
also
had
a
mixed
motive
and
the
other
motive
was
invalid,
it
was...
he
was
also
terminated
and
based
upon
his
history
of
drug
and
alcohol
addiction,
the
case
has
to
be
resolved
by
a
jury.
and
the
question--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--your
honor,
i
misspoke.
if
i
said
disparate
impact,
i
meant
to
say
discriminatory
intent.
the
question
of
raytheon's
intent.
did
it
apply
this
alleged
uniform
practice
or
did
it
discriminatorily
intend
to
terminate
mr.
hernandez
because
he
has
this
record
of
drug
and
alcohol
addiction?
they're
distinct
bases.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
refuse
to
hire,
yes.
i...
i...
and...
and
both--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--your
honor,
that
is
a...
i...
i
can't
resolve
that.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
i
do,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--because
that
footnote
is
directly
contrary
to
the
record.
in
fact,
in
the
district--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--i
won't
speculate
on
that,
your
honor.
but
i...
i
will
say
that
i
disagree
with
my
learned
friends
representing
raytheon
that
we
admitted
that
this
oral
practice
was
applied
to
mr.
hernandez
in
this
case
because
we
don't
even
think
that
the
practice
exists.
the
reason
why
we
don't
think
the
practice
exists
is
because
in
raytheon's
first
official
written
statement
in
this
very
case,
raytheon
doesn't
mention
it.
it
doesn't
mention
a
practice.
it
doesn't
mention
a
rule.
it
doesn't
represent...
or
it
doesn't
indicate
that
there's
a
policy.
it
just
says
there's
a
right,
which
is
very
different.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
i
know
it
says
that
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
meant
in
that
footnote
is
that
there's
no
question
that
raytheon
claims
that
it
applied
that.
and
i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
trying
to
get
at
was
that
even
if
raytheon's
story
is
true,
raytheon
still
doesn't
necessarily
win
because
raytheon's
alleged
practice
could
be
violative
of
the
ada
as
applied
to
mr.
hernandez
in
this
particular
case.
but
the
question
of
discriminatory
intent
remains.
moreover
and
just
as
importantly,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
alleged
practice
exists
remains.
this
is
an
oral...
this
is
a
right
that
raytheon
alleged.
there's
no...
no
evidence
that
this
rule
was
ever
applied
to
anyone
else.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
yes,
that's--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
a
question
of
disputed
material
fact.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
yes,
we
did.
we
believe
that
the
question
presented
in
the
petitioner's
cert
petition
is
hypothetical
because
it's
contingent
upon
at
least
two
dispositive
material
factual
disputes,
the
question
of
discriminatory
intent
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
uniform
practice
actually
exists.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
yes,
you
can.
however,
i
think
that
in
order
to
reach
that,
you
have
to
make
a
factual
assumption
that
might
be
incorrect,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
premature
for
the
court
to
render
that
assumption
or
to
make
that
assumption
at
this
juncture
because
it
could
be
that
if
this
case
were
remanded
to
the
trial
court,
jury
instructions
would
render
that
aspect
of
this
court's
opinion
moot.
for
example,
a
jury
could
answer
affirmatively
whether
or
not--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--your
honor,
i
think
that
it...
it
certainly
reached
the
borders
of
article
iii.
maybe
a
declaratory
judgment
action
could
have
been
filed--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well,
it
would
depend
upon
the
facts.
if
the
assumed
facts
were
identical,
then
perhaps
it
would
be
binding.
however,
those
facts
are
clearly
assumptions
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
that's
true,
your
honor.
however,
that
makes
this
case
much
less
worthy
of
this
court's
consideration
at
this
juncture
because
even
though
the
ninth
circuit
is
perhaps
closer
to
the
district
court
and
has
more
judicial
resources
to
resolve
those
types
of
declaratory
questions,
those
questions
might,
once
again,
be
rendered
moot
in
this
particular
case
if
the
jury
concludes
that
there
was
no
oral
practice
and
that
in
fact
it
was
made
up,
or
if
the
jury
concludes
that
notwithstanding
any
oral
practice--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--that...
that--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well,
in...
in
that...
in
that
event,
justice
scalia,
the
answer--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--i
understand.
and...
and
the
answer
to
raytheon's
petition
in
that
event
would
be
a
resounding
yes.
the
ada
does
grant
preferential
rehiring
rights
to
an
employee
who
was
terminated
for
misconduct
if
four
conditions
are
met.
the
misconduct
was
related
to
a
disability
as
defined
by
the
ada.
the
disabled
individual
in
question
is
rehabilitated
from
the
disabling
addiction
that
this
case
concerns.
and
raytheon
is
unable
to
establish
undue
hardship
as
an
affirmative
defense.
raytheon
is
unable
to
establish
business
necessity
as
an...
as
a
affirmative
defense.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
yes.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
well,
they...
they
didn't
get
to
it
using
that
terminology.
however,
they
did
get
to
it
in
saying
that
this
uniform
rule
violated
the
ada
as
applied
to
mr.
hernandez
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
well--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
you'd
call
it
a
reasonable
accommodation
or
a
relaxation
of
the
qualification
requirement
because
the...
the
ada,
under
12112(b)(6),
does
apply
to
qualification
standards,
employment
tests,
or
other
selection
criteria
that
screen
out
or
tend
to
screen
out
an
individual
with
a
disability
or
a
class
of
individuals.
and
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit,
by
any
other
words,
was
talking
about
in
this
case.
there's
a...
an
alleged,
a
highly
disputed
qualification
standard
that
screens
out
this
particular
individual,
mr.
joel
hernandez.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
you
would
be
accommodating
the
disability
of
disabling
addiction
to
drugs
and
alcohol.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
well,
but
the
ada--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--but
the
ada...
under
the
definition
of
disability
set
forth
by
the
ada,
justice
scalia,
someone
with
a
record
of
a
disability
is
in
fact
disabled
under
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
his
former...
you're
relaxing
a
qualification
standard
that
would...
that
would
hinder
the
entrance
of
a
reformed
alcoholic
who
was
disabled
under
the
statute
into
the
job
market,
which
is
the
purpose
of
the
ada,
not
to
segregate
disabled
individuals
who
can
work
from
the
job
market.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
well,
it...
it...
justice
o'connor--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--it
doesn't
fit
in--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--to
the
traditional
reasonable
accommodation
analysis.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
however,
it
does
fit
into
the
statute,
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
12(b)(6),
those
qualification
standards
that
screen
out.
under
the
ada,
those
have
to
be
relaxed.
whether
you
call
the
relaxation
of
those
standards
reasonable
accommodation
or
whether
you
call
it
something
else,
substantively
it's
the
same
thing.
it
is
an
accommodation
of
a
qualification
standard
or
a
relaxation
of
a
qualification
standard
based
upon
a
particularized
inquiry
regarding
an
individual
applicant.
that's
what
the
ada
expressly
demands
in
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
and
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
talking
about
in
this
case
when
it
said
raytheon's
alleged
uniform
practice
violated
the
ada.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
well,
it's
hard
to
say
that
it's
not
presented
in
this
case,
justice
stevens,
because
the
ninth
circuit
addressed
that
very
issue.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
well,
it
didn't
cite
112,
but
it...
it--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--and
i...
i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
meant
by
that,
justice
stevens,
is
that
we're
not
talking
about
a
class
of
individuals
treated
disparately.
we're
talking
about
one
individual
who
was
treated
discriminatorily.
and
the
ada
also--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well,
your
honor,
even
though
there's
that
language
regarding
disparate
impact,
it
nevertheless
ruled
the
way
it
did
and
said
that
this...
and...
and
in
fact,
the...
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well,
your
honor,
the
employer
had
the
ability
to
assert
those
affirmative
defenses
in
its
complaint
in
the
district
court,
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case,
and
it
did
not.
undue
hardship,
business
necessity,
direct
threat,
all
of
those--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well,
clearly,
justice
scalia,
mr.
hernandez
was
challenging
this
rule
that
screened
him
out,
and
if
in
fact--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well...
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
you
construe
the
facts
and
the
inferences
in
mr.
hernandez's
favor,
as
you
must,
mr.
john
lyman's
letter,
who
is
the
aa
sponsor,
says
that
he
is
in
recovery
from
addiction.
and
if
you
construe
the
inferences
in
mr.
hernandez's
favor
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
i
think
that
that
would
also
include
his
addiction
from
other
substances
as
well.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
yes,
your
honor.
however,
because
aa
offers
a
rehabilitation
program
for
any
type
of
alcohol
or
substance
abuse,
i
don't
think
it
would
really
matter
in
this
case
if
you
construe
the
facts
and
the
inferences
in
favor
of
mr.
hernandez,
as
you
must,
because
he
was
the
non-moving
party
in
the
context
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
well...
well--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--i...
i
don't
think
it's
a
wild
leap
into
the
dark,
and
i
think
it's
supported
by
the
text
of
mr.
john
lyman's
letter.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
it
is
appendix
14a,
justice
ginsburg,
and
it
says,
joel
attends
aa
regularly,
participates
in
discussion
when
appropriate,
and
is
maintaining
his
sobriety,
and
is
in
all
a
good
and
active
member.
mr.
hernandez
is
maintaining
his
sobriety.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
that
is
a
general
statement.
and
there
are
many--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--yes,
clean
and
sober.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
i...
i
think
it
can
refer
to
any--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well,
i...
i
think...
i
think
that
if
someone
is
not
on
drugs,
someone
can
be
described
as
clean
and
sober.
sober
means--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
but
this
letter...
this
letter
is
unequivocal
that
he
was
in
recovery.
this
letter
is
unequivocal
that
he
was
maintaining
his
sobriety,
and
i...
and
i
contend
that
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
there's
more
than...
alcohol
is
just
one
form
of
drug,
and
alcohol
is
a
drug
that
impacts
sobriety.
there
are
other
drugs
that
impact
sobriety,
and
cocaine
impacts
sobriety.
i
think
that
the
clear
import
of
this
letter
is
that
he
is
clean
and
sober
in
all
respects
and
is
taking
responsibility
for
his
recovery
in
all
respects.
and
the
point
that
justice
ginsburg
brings
up
is
not
a
point
that
the
trial
court
gave
any
credence
to.
it's
not
a
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
any
credence
to.
and
that
is
really
the
type
of
argument
that
i
would
contend
should
be
presented
to
the
jury.
and...
and
that's
especially
true
in
this
case
because
raytheon
claims--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--that
is...
that
is
correct.
however,
depending
upon
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
some--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well...
well,
if...
if
there's
a
factual
dispute,
justice
rehnquist,
then
the
summary
judgment
is
no
longer...
then
summary
judgment
is
no
longer
appropriate.
what
i
perhaps
should
have
stated
is
that
this...
this
letter
renders
summary
judgment
inappropriate
in
reference
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
hernandez
is
maintaining
his
recovery.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
that...
that
is
true.
that
is
part
of
the
record.
and
moreover
and
more
importantly,
that
is
unrebutted
below.
at
no
time
in
this
proceedings
did
raytheon
ever
question
mr.
hernandez's
rehabilitation.
on
july
4th
of
1992
in
his
affidavit,
mr.
hernandez
said
that
he
embraced
jesus
christ
as
his
lord
and
savior
and
foreswear
drugs
and
alcohol.
that
is
in
his
affidavit.
that
is
unrefuted.
and
more
important...
and
just
as
importantly,
raytheon
didn't
subject
him
to
an
ime.
under
rule
35,
hey,
you
say
you're...
you're
rehabilitated?
prove
it.
let's
send
you
to
a
physician
to
let
him
ascertain
that.
the
question
of
rehabilitation
is
in
fact
a
question
of
fact
that
was
not
contested
in
the
proceedings
below,
and
in
fact--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
well--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--yes,
that
is
true,
justice
stevens.
and
justice
o'connor,
in
fact,
in
george
medina's
letter,
he
says
that
there's
a
complete
lack
of
evidence
indicating
successful
drug
rehabilitation,
indicating
that
raytheon
believed
that
he
was
still
addicted.
and
not
only
does
raytheon
say
that
once
in
a
footnote
in
its
position
statement,
it
also
says
it
again.
mr.--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--well,
they...
it's
a
false
belief
that
they
believe
he's
addicted.
and...
and
if
he's
regarded
as
taking
drugs
and
alcohol
and
is...
and
is
disabled
as
a
result
of
that
addiction,
then
he
is
regarded
as
disabled
under
the
act,
which
is
exactly
what
raytheon
said
in
writing
in
its
first
official
statement
regarding
this
case.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
your
honor,
the
rule
was
tested
in
the
context
of
the
deposition
examination
of
the
only
two
witnesses
that
raytheon
produced
who
testified
about
the
rule:
bockmiller
and
medina.
and,
first
of
all,
no
one
knew
the
genesis
of
the
rule
where...
or...
or
not...
they
didn't
even
describe
it
as
a
rule.
in
the
depositions,
they
described
it
as
a
practice,
and
they
didn't
know
the
origin
of
the
practice.
they
didn't
know
how
often
it
had
been
applied.
they
didn't
know
why
it
hadn't
been
written
down.
and
moreover
and...
and
very
importantly,
this
oral
practice
contradicted
raytheon's
written
practices.
for
example,
under
raytheon's
written
rules,
a
temporary
employee
who
tests
positive
for
drugs
and
alcohol,
quote,
will
have
their
assignment
terminated
and
will
not
be
eligible
for
assignment
or
for
regular
employment
for
the
succeeding
12
months.
so
raytheon
has
a
written
rule
that
is
actually
contrary
to
its
alleged
oral
practice,
which
impeaches
the
testimony
regarding
the
existence
of
the
written
rule.
if
a
temporary
employee
tests
positive
for
drugs
and
alcohol,
the
temporary
employee
is
terminated,
but
can
reapply
even
for
permanent
employment...
temporary
or
permanent
employment
within
12
months.
that
impeaches
the
very
existence
of
the
alleged
oral
practice.
in
fact--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
however,
that's
a
two-edged
sword.
raytheon
also
didn't
adduce
any
evidence
of
its
application
to
any
other
individual
and
that
would
actually
be
raytheon's
burden.
if
we,
as
the
ninth
circuit
concluded,
established
a
prima
facie
case,
then
it's
raytheon's
duty
to
rebut
that
prima
facie
case
with
some
form
of
evidence.
the
only
evidence
that
raytheon
produced
in
reference
to
this
oral
practice
was
the
testimony
of
bockmiller
and
medina,
and
they
didn't
adduce
any
applications
of
this
rule
either.
so
if
you
look
at
the
totality
of
evidence,
actually
that
deficit
in
the
record
cuts
against
raytheon
and
in
favor
of
mr.
hernandez.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
your--
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
--no,
that's
not
the
only
reason.
if...
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
scalia,
it's
not
only
a
question
of
reasonable
accommodation,
it's
also
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he's
the
most
qualified.
it's
also
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he
constitutes
a
direct
threat
or
his
rehiring
would
give
rise
to
an
undue
hardship
or
was
justified
by
a
business
necessity.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
g.
montoya
yes,
your
honor.
based
upon
12(b)(6),
the
screen
out
or
tend
to
screen
out,
this
screened
out
this
particular
individual,
and
in
that
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
this
case
is
very
analogous
to
the
court's
opinion
in
pga
v.
martin
where
you
have
a
uniform
rule
that
someone
claims
is
not
subject
to
any
exception.
i
think
that
this
rule
violates
the
ada,
as
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
because
this
rule
is
the
antithesis
of
a
particularized
inquiry
that
the
case
law
demands
a
disabled
applicant
or
a
disabled
employee
receive
under
the
americans
with
disability
act.
if
your
honors
have
no
further
questions,
i'll
thank
you.
