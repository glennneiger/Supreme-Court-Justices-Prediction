mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner,
like
thousands
of
other
employers
throughout
this
country,
has
a
policy
that
if
an
employee
is
discharged
for
violating
a
workplace
rule...
usually
that
involves
serious
misconduct
in
the...
in
the
workplace...
then
he
becomes
permanently
ineligible
to
be
rehired
by
that
particular
employer.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
correctly
held
at
fed.
app.
12a,
note
17,
that
there
is
no
question
that
petitioner
applied
this
policy
in
rejecting
respondent's
application.
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
there's
no
question
that
this
policy
on
its
face
is
not
unlawful.
nonetheless,
the
ninth
circuit
declared
that
even
in
a
case
alleging
only
disparate
treatment,
the,
quote,
policy
violates
the
ada
as
applied
to
former
drug
addicts
whose
only
work-related
offense
was
testing
positive
because
of
their
addiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
rest
of
the
opinion
is
not
dicta,
justice
o'connor.
the...
that
portion
of
the
analysis
is...
is
directed
solely
at
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
and
what
the
court
said
was,
you
know,
is
there
any
evidence
from
which
anyone
could
draw
the
inference
that
there
was
discrimination
because
of
a
disability.
and
it
recognized
frankly
that
that
was
a
very
close
question,
that
if
you
read
even
the...
the
statement
made
to
the
eeoc,
you
can
read
that
in
different
ways.
maybe
you
should
look
at
bockmiller.
but
the
truth
is
in
making
the
prima
facie
showing,
all
that
you
really
needed
to
look
at
was
the
policy
statement...
or
the...
the
response
to
the
eeoc,
and
that
would
be
enough,
i
think,
to
get
you
past
the
prima
facie
showing.
it...
it
is
at
page
10a
where
the
court
then
turns
its
complete
attention,
and
it
says,
you
know,
so
in
sum
we
hold
that...
that
hernandez's
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
has
been
made
out,
and
now
we
turn
to
the
next
stage
in
the
process,
which
is
to
look
and
see
whether
or
not
there
is
a...
a
non-pretextual
justification.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
there
were
a
genuine
issue
of
fact,
you...
you
would...
you
know,
you'd
remand
to
allow
the
case
to
go
forward.
there's
clearly
not
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
because
if
you...
once
you
get
past
just
looking
at
the
eeoc
statement
that
was
made
by
the
employer
and...
and
you're
in
the
district
court
and
you're
looking
at
summary
judgment
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
employer
is
pretextual,
we
only
have
the
burden
to
come
forward
and
say
we
had
a...
a
perfectly
lawful
reason
for
doing
what
we
did.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i...
yes,
they
are
two
different
questions,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
i
think
we
probably
would
have
been
entitled
to
summary
judgment
even
on
the
prima
facie
showing.
the
only
way
the
court
of
appeals
got
to
its
analysis...
the
only
way
it
could
have
gotten
there
under
hazen
paper...
is
to
say
that
the
pretextual
basis...
the
pretextual
argument
that
was
put
forward
by
the
employer...
we
have
to
take
that
off
the
table
because
if
that...
if
that
policy
is
in
this
case,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
that
policy
was
not
applied
in
this
particular
case.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in...
in
the
footnote
in
its
opinion.
it
said
that's
unquestioned.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
there's
no
question
that
respondent
has
asserted
arguments
that
the...
that...
that
there's
a
question
as
to
whether
the
policy
exists.
the
ninth
circuit
expressly
held
that
the
policy
exists
and
was
applied
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
take
footnotes
seriously
in
all
court's
opinions,
your
honor.
[laughter]
well,
but
i
mean,
it
could
not
have
been
more
explicit
in
terms
of
dealing
with
this
particular
issue.
was
the
policy
presented
and
was
it...
was...
did
the
policy
exist
and
was
it
applied
in
this
particular
case?
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
there's
no
testimony
that
raises
any
doubt.
it
may
be
that
it's
an
unwritten
policy,
but
the
testimony
in
the
joint
appendix
at
22a,
57a,
59a,
71a,
72a,
and
73a,
which
is
the
affidavit
and
deposition
testimony
of
bockmiller
who
was
the
decision
maker
in
this
case
and
medina
who
signed
the...
the
statement,
is
consistent,
that...
that
there
is
an
absolute
policy
and
practice
that
this
employer
uniformly
uses.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
justice
ginsburg,
the
respondent
had
a
full
opportunity
for
discovery
in
this
case.
he
was
an
employee
for
25
years.
if
he
had
known
of
any
instances
in
which
this
rule
hadn't
been
applied,
he
could
presumably
have
brought
that
forward.
if
he
could
have
discovered
any
instance
in
which
this
rule
had
not
been
applied
consistently--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--actually
he's
not
specific
in...
in
regard
to
that.
i
mean,
he's
made
that
argument
at
this
stage
in
the
proceedings,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
certainly
nothing
during
the
deposition
testimony,
in
which
he
says...
there's
nothing
in
his
affidavit.
but...
but,
justice
o'connor,
it's
worth
reading
the
joint
appendix...
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
i
apologize.
[laughter]
but,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
worth
reading
on
joint
appendix
70a.
you
know,
this...
his
application
would
have
been
rejected
had
he
been
fired
for
stealing
or
fighting
or
anything
like
that.
it's
unequivocal,
absolutely
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
record.
there
is
no
question--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
you
could...
you
could
continue
to
assert
that
the...
that
our
policy
is
our
policy
and
we're
entitled
to
assert
that
policy.
now,
you
know,
there
are
alternative
theories
that
could
be
brought
forward.
one...
one
could
be
that
the
policy
has
a
disparate
impact,
which
wasn't
litigated
in
this
case--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
also--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
are
sort
of
three
answers
to
that
in
terms
of
the
reasonable
accommodation
rationale.
first
of
all,
remember
that
this
is
not
an
employee
any
longer
who
is
in
fact
disabled.
this
is
one
who's
merely
regarded
as
or
has
a
record
of.
and
the
statute
specifically
talks
about
accommodating
the
limitations
of
the
employee.
so
there...
there
are
no
limitations
here.
so
i
think
(b)(5)
by
its
terms
doesn't
apply.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't...
i
don't
know
that
that
doesn't
require
any...
anything
with
respect
to
applicants
or
any
accommodation
with
respect
to
applicants.
i
don't...
i...
i
think
what
it
doesn't
do
is
allow
you
to
look
beyond
whether
there
are
limitations
that
need
to
be
accommodated.
and
i
don't
think
it...
and
i
don't
think
it
is
a
reasonable
accommodation
within
the
meaning
of
(b)(5)
to
say
that
you're
entitled
to
a
second
bite
of
the
apple.
if
you
have
violated
a
misconduct
rule
and
been
discharged
for
that
reason,
whether
it's
drug-related
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
clear
under
the
statute...
certainly
it's
clear
under...
under
114(c)(4)...
that
that
is
precisely
the
situation
in
which
the
employer
is
allowed
to
discharge
you
and
to
impose
a--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
because
i
think
the
reason
is
is
that
in
order
to
allow
this
employee
to
come
back
under
these
circumstances,
you
have
to...
you
have
to
discriminate
in
his
favor
because
if...
if
this
were
a
person
who--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
that's
why
you
have
to
look
at
114(c)(4),
which
says
specifically
that
you
are
entitled
to
treat
former
drug
addicts
precisely
the
way
you
would
treat
any
other
employee.
so
then
the
question
i
think
is
if
this
employee
had
been
discharged
originally
because
he
was
a
sex
offender
or
a
sexual
harasser
and...
and
had
a
psychological
reason
for
it,
and
he
came
back
in
and
he
said,
i'm...
i'm
cured,
i'm
fixed,
i
want
to
come
back
to
work
now,
the
answer
there
might
be
one
thing.
i
don't
know
the...
you
know,
there
may
be
a
reasonable
accommodation
issue
there.
but
with
respect
to
114(c)(4),
which
very
specifically
says
that
you're
allowed
to
impose
qualification
standards
that
are
the
same
where
you're
not
going
to
allow
that
other
employee
to
come
in...
that's
the
way
your
policy
operates...
applying
that
rule
fairly
to
this
situation
means
that
this
employee
is
not
entitled
to
come
in.
i
don't
think
it's
a
flat
rule
against
applicants
versus
non-applicants.
i
think
it's
a
(c)(4)...
114(c)(4)
rule
that
says
that
you
are
always
entitled
to
treat
the
rehabilitated
drug
addict
exactly
the
same
way
you
would
treat
anyone
else
who
engaged
in
misconduct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
it
did
address
the
reasonable
accommodation
issue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
any
more
than
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
might
be
and...
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
in
this
case.
as
i
say,
i
think
114(c)(4)
is
a
complete
answer
to
the
reasonable
accommodation
argument,
and
i
think
frankly
114(c)(4)
is
a
complete
answer
to
the
disparate
impact
argument,
which
the
court
of
appeals
also
not
only
didn't
get
into,
but
found
had
been
expressly
waived.
that's
why
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
what
this
case
is
about
is
hazen
paper.
we
have
a
rule
here
that
was
unquestionably
applied.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
it
wasn't
applied.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
any
employers
who's
in
the
middle
of
litigation
would
be
irrational
not
to
try
to
find
some
kind
of
a
non-litigated
solution
to
the
problem.
and
so
we
were
looking
for
a
non-litigated
solution
to
the
problem.
since
he
wasn't
qualified
in
1999,
it
wasn't
available
to
us
to
bring
him
back
or
to
try
to
come
up
with
some
other
kind
of
a
settlement.
i
think
it
completely
inappropriate
to
hold
it
against
us
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
solution
to
this
case
that
wouldn't
have
required
us
to
take
the
time
of
the
court
at
that
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but,
of
course,
mr.
hernandez
was
an
employee
in
1991.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
we
discharged
him
and
then
we
imposed
on
him
the
same
qualification
standards
that
we
would
impose
to
anyone
that
we
discharged
under
those
exact
same
circumstances.
he
is
dismissed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
he
is
permanently
barred
on...
on
a
going-forward
basis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
language
clearly
covers
this.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
(c)(4)
would...
would
trump
the
reasonable
accommodation
argument,
if...
if
it
had
been
properly
raised
and
it
were
before
the
court.
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we'd
win
that,
but
justice
o'connor...
i
got
the
name
right
there...
is
clearly
right
that
that
issue
wasn't
resolved
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
therefore
remains
open.
i
mean,
it
is
not
an
issue
for
this
court
at
this
point.
i
just
want
to
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
rule
was
applied...
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
that
you
can
question
that
there
is
an
issue
of
fact
to
be
resolved
as
to
how
this
rule
was
applied
in
this
circumstance.
in
order
to
discount
the
applicability
of
the
rule
as
the
basis
for
mr.
hernandez's
rejection,
you
have
to
declare
that
ms.
bockmiller
flat-out
lied,
and
she
didn't.
everything
in
the
record
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
the
idea
that
she
looked
at
the
summary
separation,
she
concluded
that
there
was
no
basis
to
go
forward
with
this
case,
and
she
acted
accordingly.
an
employee...
obviously,
employers
are
allowed
to
use
their
own
employee's
testimony.
it
cannot
be
that
that's
an
interested
witness
whose
testimony
is
not
entitled
to
credit
when
it
is
absolutely
uncontradicted.
so
we
are
not
only
entitled
to
have
this
rule
set
aside,
we're
also
entitled
to
judgment
at
the
end
of
the
day.
thank
you,
your
honors.
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
ways
to
look
at
this
case.
one
is
you
can
simply
take
the
court
of
appeals
at
its
word,
which
is
to
say
we
think
there's
a
question
for...
that...
that
defeats
summary
judgment
on
a
prima
facie
case,
but
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
what
the
policy
is
of
the...
of
the
employer
in
this
case,
there's
no
dispute
about
that,
the
employer's
policy
was
applied,
and
then
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
policy
is
valid
under
the
ada.
i
have
not
heard
mr.
montoya
yet
attempt
to
defend
that...
that
holding
in
the
face
of
a
disparate
treatment
theory
in
this
case.
he
puts
in
disparate
impact
under
12(b)(6).
he
puts
in
reasonable
accommodation,
112(b)(6)
and
112(b)(5).
those
are
not
issues
that
were
decided
below.
they
were
not
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
is
a
decision
that
has
extraordinary
implications
because
thousands
of
employers
have
precisely
this
rule.
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
declare
that
that
rule
is
valid.
on
the
secondary
question...
and
that
is,
can
the
court
get
to
that
question?
i
think
there's
no
doubt
that
the
court
ought
to
just
follow
the
court
of
appeals'
logic
on
that.
but
if
the
court
wanted
to
look
at
whether
or
not
there
is
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
this
person
was
discriminated
against
because
of
his
disability,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
record
does
not
permit
a
jury
to
make
that
finding
under
this
court's
decision
in
reeves.
bockmiller
was
the
decision
maker.
she
testified,
without
contradiction,
that
she
never
looked
past
the
summary
sheet
that
said
he
was
discharged
because
of
conduct,
and
that
was
it.
and
she
didn't
have
to
look
beyond
that.
medina
testified,
without
contradiction,
that
that
is
the
policy
that
applies.
she
applied
it
in
the
right
way.
we
do
it
consistently.
it
would
have
made
no
difference
whether
he
was
a
thief
or
whether
he
was
somebody
who
used
drugs.
we
applied
it
that
way.
mr.
montoya
and
his
client
had
2
years
to
discover
whether
that
policy
existed,
whether
it
had
exceptions,
whether
it
was
applied
in
any
other
particular
way,
and
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence...
he
didn't
even
ask
those
witnesses
if
there
were
flaws
in
the
way
they
applied
it.
that
is
absolutely
across
the
board.
the
only...
and...
and
then,
you
know,
this
is
a
policy
that
exists.
thousands
of
employers
use
precisely
this
policy,
which
is
why
frankly
it
probably
isn't
written
down.
and
so
at
the
end
of
the
day,
there
is
nothing
on
the
other
side
of
this
except
the
one
statement
that
was
sufficient
to
justify
getting
beyond
the
prima
facie
stage
of
this
case,
but
that
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
taking
this
to
a
conclusion
or
to
raise
an
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
discriminated
against
because
of
his
disability.
he
was
acted
against
because
he
violated
the
company
policy.
that
policy
is
valid
under
the
ada,
at
least
as
it's
been
litigated
at
this
point,
and
for
that
reason
the
court
should
reverse
and
enter
judgment
in
our
favor.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you,
your
honors.
