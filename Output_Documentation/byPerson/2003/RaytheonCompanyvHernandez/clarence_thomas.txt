justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent
joel
hernandez
was
employed
by
petitioner
for
25
years,
until
he
showed
up
at
work
appearing
to
be
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol.
pursuant
to
company
policy
respondent
took
a
drug
test,
which
came
back
positive
for
cocaine.
because
respondent’s
behavior
violated
petitioner’s
workplace
conduct
rule,
respondent
was
forced
to
resign.
more
than
two
years
later
respondent
applied
to
be
rehired
by
petitioner,
his
application
was
rejected.
respondent
then
filed
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
eeoc,
complaining
or
claiming
that
he
had
been
discriminated
against
in
violation
of
the
american’s
with
disabilities
act
ada.
the
eeoc
issued
a
right-to-sue
letter,
and
respondent
filed
this
disparate
treatment
action
under
the
ada,
alleging
that
petitioner
rejected
his
application
because
of
his
record
of
drug
addiction
and
because
petitioner
regarded
him
as
being
a
drug
addict.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
petitioner.
a
ninth
circuit
panel
reversed,
under
the
burden-shifting
approach
set
forth
by
this
court
in
mcdonnell
douglas
v.
green.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
respondent
hernandez,
have
proffered
sufficient
evidence
to
preclude
a
grant
of
summary
judgment.
the
ninth
circuit
then
moved
to
the
next
step
of
mcdonnell
douglas,
where
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant
to
provide
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
its
employment
action.
here
petitioner
contended
that
it
applied
a
neutral
company
policy
against
rehiring
employees
previously
terminated
for
violating
workplace
conduct
rules.
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
this
explanation,
reasoning
that
even
if
petitioner
did
apply
a
neutral
no-rehire
policy
in
rejecting
respondent’s
application,
such
a
policy
could
never
constitute
a
legitimate
non-discriminatory
reason
for
refusing
to
hire
a
person
who
was
previously
terminated
for
illegal
drug
use,
because
such
a
policy
has
a
disparate
impact
on
recovering
drug
addicts.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
a
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
a
distinction
between
claims
of
discrimination
based
on
disparate
treatment
and
claims
of
discrimination
based
on
disparate
impact.
in
a
disparate
treatment
claim,
the
question
is
whether
the
employee's
protected
trait
actually
motivated
the
employer’s
decision.
a
neutral
generally
applicable
no-hire
policy
is
quintessentially
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason,
for
refusing
to
rehire
an
employee,
because
there
is
no
question
of
discriminatory
intent.
whether
such
a
policy
has
a
disparate
impact
is
a
different
question
that
is
not
implicated
by
this
case.
accordingly,
because
the
ninth
circuit
erroneously
rejected
petitioner’s
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
refusing
to
rehire
respondent,
we
vacate
its
judgment.
under
mcdonnell
douglas,
the
only
remaining
question
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
whether
respondent
has
produced
sufficient
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent,
for
jury
to
believe
that
petitioner’s
proffered
explanation
was
pretextual.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
souter
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case;
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
the
decision
in
this
case.
