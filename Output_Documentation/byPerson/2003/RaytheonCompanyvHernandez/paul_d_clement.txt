mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
policy...
a
mutual
policy
of
refusing
to
rehire
individuals
previously
terminated
for
serious
misconduct
does
not
constitute
disparate
treatment
for
purposes
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
even
as
applied
to
an
individual
previously
discharged
for
drug-related
misconduct.
the
policy
does
not
single
out
people
who
are
addicted
or
those
who
test
positive
for
drugs
for
disfavorable
treatment.
the
policy
treats
all
serious
misconduct,
whether
drug-related
or
not,
the
same.
as
a
result,
an
individual
who
is
refused
re-employment
pursuant
to
that
policy
is
simply
not
subject
to
disparate
treatment
because
of
their
disability.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
o'connor,
in
our
brief
we
suggested
that
it
would
be
possible
to
grant
summary
judgment
for
the
employer
here
on
this
record.
i
have
to
confess,
though,
that
that
issue
is
of
considerable
less
importance
to
the
government
than
the
broader
validity
of
this
rule.
one
thing
i...
i'll
address
why
we
think
summary
judgment
might
be
appropriate,
but
i
want
to
emphasize,
though,
that
even
if
the
court
thinks
that
summary
judgment
is
not
appropriate
here,
the
proper
disposition
would
be
to
vacate
and
remand.
but
it's
very
important
to
vacate
the
opinion
because
the
theory
of
the
ninth
circuit,
if
you
can
divine
one
here,
is
that,
all
right,
there's
a
pretextual
case
for
discrimination
and
the
employer
comes
in
and
says,
we
didn't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
disability.
we
applied
a
neutral,
across-the-board
rule.
and
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
what
they
say
is
that
neutral
rule
is
not
a
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
basis
for
your
employment
action.
and
they...
they
do
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that
is
a
profoundly
wrong
decision
as
a
matter
of
law,
especially
in
a
disparate
treatment
case
because
justice
stevens
suggested
that
maybe
you
could
have
a
reasonable
accommodation
theory
but
that's
not
in
this
case.
it
is
possible
that
the
language
of
42
u.s.c.
12112(b)(6),
which
embodies
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
disparate
impact
principles,
could
be
used
to
challenge
the
neutral
policy.
but
whatever
else
is
true,
when
an
employer
applies
a
neutral
policy,
it
has
not
engaged
in
disparate
treatment
on
the
basis
of
disability.
now,
if
i
can
get
back
to
the
summary
judgment
question.
i
think
there's
two
reasons
why
we
thought
summary
judgment
was...
would
be
appropriate
for
the
employer.
one
is
as
suggested
by
mr.
phillips.
in
footnote
17,
after
the
court
of
appeals
finishes
with
its
pretext
analysis,
it
seems
to
suggest
that
there's
really
no
dispute
that
both
sides
agree
that
this
policy
was
invoked.
and
i
think
in...
in
looking
through
the
lower
court
record,
it
doesn't
seem
like
the
gravamen
of
the
respondent's
case
was
that
the
policy
doesn't
exist.
it
was
more
a...
a
suggestion
that
whether
or
not
you
have
a
policy,
as
to
me
in
particular
that's
not
the
reason
for
the
discharge,
and
the
best
evidence
of
that,
of
course,
is
the
letter
that
george
medina
sent
to
the
eeoc.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes,
the
best
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
has
is
that
letter
to
the
eeoc
from
mr.
medina.
and,
of
course,
that
letter
suggests
that
it
was
more
complicated
than
simply
application
of
a
neutral
policy,
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
the
eeoc
issued
a...
a
cause
to
sue
letter.
unfortunately,
though,
mr....
mr.
medina
was
not
the
ultimate
decision
maker
in
this
case.
that
was
joanne
bockmiller.
and
the
record
is
clear...
and
this
is
at
joint
appendix
51a
and
then
64a.
it's
clear
that
ms.
bockmiller
did
not
participate
in
the
preparation
of
that
medina
letter.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
not
the
way
i
read
this
court's
decision
in
anderson
against
liberty
lobby,
which
seems
to
suggest
that
simply
the
possibility
that
the
jury
will
not
disbelieve
testimony
even
if
there's
no
other
evidence
that
draws
that
testimony
into
question--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
not
enough.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
think
that
if
the
medina...
certainly
if
medina
were
the
decision
maker
or
even
one
of
the
decision
makers
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they
certainly
did,
but
the...
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
bockmiller
was
the
ultimate
decision
maker.
and
in
hazen
paper,
this
court
suggested
that
in
these
kind
of
disparate
treatment
cases,
what
you're
looking
for
is
if--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
he
just
wasn't
the
decision
maker.
i
think,
though,
i...
i've
made
our
position
clear,
which
is
when
you
have
a
case
where
there's
an
ultimate
decision
maker
who
suggests
a
neutral
policy
was
involved,
our
position
would
be
a...
a
straight
statement
by
somebody
who
was
not
involved
in...
directly
in
the
decision
making
process
shouldn't
preclude
summary
judgment.
i
do
want
to
be
clear,
though,
that
that
really
is
the
less
important
issue
for
the...
from
the
government's
perspective
because
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
does
embody
the
position
that
this
kind
of
neutral
policy,
assuming
it
exists
for
a
moment,
is
somehow
per
se
unlawful
as
applied
to
drug
addicts.
and
i
think,
again
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
there
may
be
ways
that
a
plaintiff
could
try
to
go
after
such
a
neutral
policy.
they
could
suggest
that
it...
that
under
a
reasonable
accommodation
theory,
a
reasonable
accommodation
must
be
given.
but
if
that
were
brought
forward,
i
think
an
employer
would
have
an
opportunity
to
say,
no,
that
reasonable
accommodation
imposes
an
undue
hardship.
in
similar
fashion...
and
i
would
say
this.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole,
the
provision
of
the
statute
that
most
specifically
speaks
to
a
neutral
qualification
criteria
that
is
alleged
to
have
a
disparate
impact
on
individuals
with
a
disability
is...
is
42
u.s.c.
12112(b)(6).
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
that
was
not
raised.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
that
was
never
addressed
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
don't
have
to
get
in,
and
we
would
suggest
that
you
not
definitively
resolve
the
reasonable
accommodation
issue
or
the
disparate
impact
theory.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
sort
of
harmless
error
if
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
stays
on
the
book
because
the
ninth
circuit
assumes
that
the
answer
to
the
question
on
reasonable
accommodation
is
that
you
could
never
justify
such
a
policy.
you'd
always
have
to
grant
a
reasonable
accommodation.
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
assumes
that
there
would
be
a
disparate
impact
even
when
there's
not
or
even
if
the
employer
could
justify
the
policy
as
job-related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity.
i
wanted
to
be
responsive
to
justice
stevens'
question,
though,
even
though
i
think
this
court
should
ultimately
not
reach
it.
with
respect
to
reasonable
accommodation,
there's
no
question
that
reasonable
accommodation
applies
in
the
application
process.
and
so
if
you
have...
for
example,
if
you're
going...
an
employer
wants
to
give
a
application
test
for
the
job,
and
puts
it
in
a
facility
that's
not
wheelchair
accessible,
that
reasonable
accommodation
would
have
to
be
given,
and
that
would
be
a
reasonable
accommodation
in
the
hiring
process.
i
do
think,
though,
that
subsection
(b)(6)
addresses
very
directly
a
neutral
qualification
standard
that's
alleged
to
screen
out
an
individual
with
a
disability
or
to
tend
to
screen
out
an
individual
with
a
disability.
and
with
respect
to
that
claim,
that
would
trigger
the
employer's
burden
to
come
forward
and
show
that
the
requirement
was
job-related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity.
one
of
the
real
sort
of
ironies,
if
you
will,
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
on
the
same
page
of
the
opinion
and
in
consecutive
footnotes,
after
they...
they
clearly
hold
that
the
disparate
impact
theory
is
not
in
this
case,
they
also
fault
the
employer
for
not
justifying
the
neutral
rule
as
consistent
with
business
necessity.
but
the
business
necessity
defense,
as
its
status
as
a
defense,
suggests
is
not
some
sort
of
free-floating
obligation
on
the
employer,
especially
in
a
disparate
treatment
case
where
the
employer
has
already
pointed
to
a
neutral
and
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
their
actions.
the
business
necessity
defense
comes
into
a
case
when
a
plaintiff
has
properly
preserved
a
claim
under
subsection
(b)(6)
and
triggers
the
obligation
of
the
employer
to
come
through.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out,
though,
that
we
largely
agree
with
mr.
phillips
that
there
is...
there
is
much
in
42
u.s.c.
12114(c)(4)
that
suggests
that
there
may
be
a
basis
for
an
employer
to
maintain
this
kind
of
neutral
policy,
and
i
think
an
employer
may
be
able
to
use
that
section
as
a
defense.
i
would
agree
with
justice
stevens
that
it
doesn't
speak
directly
to
this
situation
because
all
it
does
is
allow...
with
respect
to
current
drug
users
who
aren't
entitled
to
any
protection
under
the
act,
it
clarifies
that
an
employer
can
apply
a
neutral
qualification
standard,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
underlying
misconduct
has
its
roots
in...
in
drug
us
or
drug
addiction.
and
i
think
it
doesn't
directly
say
it,
but
implicit
in
that
provision
is
the
idea
that
an
employer
can
use
uniform
and
neutral
sanctions
for
violations
of
those
uniform
conduct
rules.
the
difficult
question
becomes
whether
or
not
there's
something
special
about
a
bar
on
re-employment,
when
you
say
that
if
you
violate
our
conduct
rules
not
only
are
you
terminated,
but
you
need
never
darken
our
door
again.
and
i
think
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
policy,
there
are
two...
the
act,
in
a
sense,
points
in
two
different
directions.
on
the
one
hand,
the
act
draws
a
clear
distinction
between
current
drug
users
who
are...
who
are
not
protected
by
the
act
and
draws
a
distinction
between
recovered
addicts
who
are
protected
by
the
act.
in...
in
any
event,
the
court
can
reconcile
those
competing
policies
in
a
subsequent
case.
