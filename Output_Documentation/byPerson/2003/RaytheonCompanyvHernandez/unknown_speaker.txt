unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
it...
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
opinion
on
about
page
8a
in
the
appendix
said,
hernandez
raises
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
as
to
whether
he
was
denied
reemployment
because
of
his
past
record
of
drug
addiction.
and
i'm
concerned
that
the
court
may
have
said
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
here,
that
it
wasn't
clear
whether
there
was
a
no-hire
policy
that
was
either
adopted
or
if
it
was
used
in
this
case,
that
there's
something
else
at
stake
due
to
the
different
responses
of
the
man
who
wrote
the
letter
versus
the
woman
who
actually
made
the
decision,
and
that
there's
some
issue
of
fact
here.
now,
if
that's
the
case,
maybe
the
rest
of
the
opinion
is
just
dicta.
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
i
might
agree
with
you
that
a
no-hire
policy,
if
that's
what
was
used,
is
certainly
not
unlawful.
but
if
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
here,
what...
what
do
we
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
the
two
questions
really
severable,
whether
the
ninth
circuit's
treatment
of
the
no-rehire
policy
was
correct
under
ada
law,
and
second,
whether
the
employer
was
entitled
to
summary
judgment?
i...
i
think
those
are
two
different
questions.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
i'm
having
the
same
problem
that
justice
o'connor
and
the
chief
expressed.
one
thing
is
if
we
take
this
case,
there's
a
no-hire
rule.
can
an
employer
have
such
a
rule
and
apply
it
with
even
hand?
that's
a
question
of
law.
but
this
case
seems
to
be
underneath
messier.
for
example,
this
no-hire
policy
was
unwritten.
this
is
a
company
that
had
a
lot
of
written
rules.
that's
an
important
rule.
why
was
it
unwritten?
why
does
medina
testify
we
had
a
right,
not
that
we'd
apply
it
every
case,
but
we
had
a
right
not
to
rehire
someone
who
was
discharged
for
cause?
the...
the
record
is
suspicious
on,
one,
whether
there
was
a
policy;
two,
whether
it
was
applied
with
an
even
hand.
that
one
can't
tell.
so
why
should
a
judge
take
this
as
given
that
there
was
indeed
such
a
policy
and
that
it...
it
was
applied
with
an
even
hand?
don't
those
questions
remain
in
the
case?
even
if
you
prevail
on
if
they
had
such
a
policy
and
if
they
applied
it
with
an
even
hand,
they
would
not
be
offending--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
held
it
in
a
footnote,
and
i'm--
unknown
speaker
--we
don't
know
from
this
record,
for
example,
whether
someone
who
had
sexually
harassed
a
fellow
worker
and
for
that
reason
was
fired,
whether
such
a
policy
would
apply...
has,
in
fact,
been
applied
to
such
a
person,
whether
someone
who
assaulted
a
co-worker
would
also
be
barred
permanently
from
re-hire.
if
there
is
the
firm
policy,
then
it's
unquestionably
legal,
but...
but
there
isn't
in
this
anything
except
two
employees
who
gave
testimony,
no
other
examples,
other
than
this
very
case,
to
show
that
this
has
been
applied
across
the
board.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
said
that
he
didn't
even
know
the
rule
existed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
makes
the
assumption
that
you
want
to
make
for
the
whole
case,
that
the
policy
was
just
applied
in
this
case?
suppose
a
person,
aware
of
the
policy,
write...
and
has
the
history
of
this
person,
and
say
you
would
admit
he's
qualified.
i
know
there's
some
doubt
about
that
in
this
case.
a
qualified
applicant,
who
has
a
history
of
drug
or
alcohol
use
and
was
fired
for
that
10
years
ago,
writes
a
letter
to
the
company
and
says
i'm
totally
aware
of
your
policy
of
not
hiring...
rehiring
people
who
were
previously
discharged
for
cause,
but
i
want
you
to
know
i
am
a
rehabilitated
person
and
therefore
i'm
handicapped
and
i
come
within
the
statute.
and
i
think
the...
the
rule
against
discriminating
against
handicaps
requires
you
to
make
a
special
accommodation
for
me.
please
do
so.
now,
why
could
you
turn
him
down?
unknown
speaker
and
if--
unknown
speaker
--a
whole
bunch
of
people.
he
says...
he
admits
he's
the
only
person
who
fits.
so
he
can't
make
a
disparate
impact
argument.
he
just
says
you
have
a
duty
to
accommodate
under
this
statute
and
your
failure
to
accommodate
is
discrimination
when
you
know
that
the
reason
for
the
policy
doesn't
apply--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
your
view
there's
no
duty
to
accommodate
for
applicants?
i'm
just
trying
to...
is
it
your
view
that
the
statute
does
not
require
any
accommodation
for
applicants
as
opposed
to
actually
employed
persons?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
discharge
isn't
in
question.
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
is
now
handicapped
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
who
was
previously
discharged
for
a
reason
that
clearly
does
not
justify
rehiring
now,
other
than
the
fact
you
want
to
have
a
rule
with
no
exceptions
to
it.
i
don't
really...
i'm
a
little
unclear
as
to
if
you
don't
say
the
duty
to
accommodate
has
no
application
to
applicants
as
opposed
to
employees,
i'm
a
little
unclear
as
to
why
this
isn't
like
a
rule
in
the
gender
discrimination
cases,
you
can't
lift
over
100
pounds
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
and
that's
always
the
case
of...
of
accommodation.
unknown
speaker
it's
always
a
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
applicant.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
i
guess
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
address
at
all
the
reasonable
accommodation
question,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
no.
so
i
guess
we'd
have
a
hard
time
in
getting
into
it,
but
it--
unknown
speaker
--may
be
a
serious
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
phillips,
one
of
the
things
is...
doesn't
quite
fit
is
in
the
case
of
this
very
employee.
he
was
given
a
test
despite
this
firm
no-hire...
no-rehire
rule.
they
did
give
him
a
test
in
1999,
and
it
turned
out
he
flunked
it
badly.
but
everyone
recognizes
that
flunking
in
1999,
when
you're
a
little
rusty,
doesn't
mean
you
would
have
flunked
in
1994,
which
is
the
critical
time
here.
but
why
did
the
company,
if
it
has
this
firm...
firm,
no-exception
policy,
no
rehires,
why
did
it
give
him
the
test
to
see
if
he
was
qualified?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
looking
at
114(c)(4),
i
think
that
speaks
to
the...
what
the
company
may
do
to
employees,
not...
it
doesn't
speak
to
former
employees--
unknown
speaker
--or
applicants
for
employment.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
think
(c)--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
think
(c)(4)
explains
why
you
didn't
have
a
duty
to
accommodate
him
when
he...
when
he
sought
re-employment.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
clement,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
clement,
does
the
government
take
a
position
on
whether
there's
an
issue
of
fact
hidden
in
this
case
about
whether
there
is
a
neutral
no-hire
policy?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
best
evidence
supporting
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
then
why
did
the
company--
--i
don't
know
that...
i
don't
know
that
that's
enough,
though,
to
defeat
summary
judgment.
a
jury
is
entitled
to
disbelieve
any
witness
i
believe,
even
though
perhaps
the...
you
don't
show
any
bias
on
the
part
of
the
witness.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is.
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
medina,
medina's
letter,
which
says,
look,
we...
we
refused
to
hire
this
person
because
he
didn't
show...
he
didn't
show
that
he
was
no
longer
an
addict.
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
the
company
designate
him
to
put
in
the
response
to
eeoc?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
relative
position
in
the
company?
i
had
the
impression
that
medina
was
a
higher
level
employee
than
bockmiller.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
disparate
impact
case
here.
that
was
not
raised,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
what
about
the
reasonable
accommodation
theory.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
address
that.
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
claim?
unknown
speaker
no.
that's
what
i
thought.
so
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that.
unknown
speaker
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
clement.
mr.
montoya,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
montoya,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
opening
statement
you
made
because
you...
you
said
this
was
a
legitimate
disparate
impact
case,
but
looking
on
that
same
page
in
the
footnote,
the
ninth
circuit
is
agreeing
with
the
district
court
that
because
hernandez
failed
to
timely
raise
disparate
impact,
this
has
got
to
be
a
disparate
treatment
case.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
mean
terminate.
you
mean
refuse
to
hire.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
makes
good
sense,
but
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
footnote...
footnote
17?
it
says,
there
is
no
question,
the
court
says,
that
hughes
applied
its
automatic
policy,
this
policy,
in
rejecting
hernandez's
application.
i
mean,
i...
it
boggles
the
mind.
unknown
speaker
you
want
us
to
give
text
more
weight
than
footnotes.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
unreasonable.
unknown
speaker
maybe
the
law
clerks
wrote
the
footnotes
and
the
judges
wrote
the
text.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
the
ninth...
the
ninth
circuit
again,
mr.
montoya,
in
footnote
17
simply
says
there's
no
question
that
hughes
applied
this
policy
in
rejecting
hernandez's
application.
unknown
speaker
we...
we
didn't
take
the
case
to...
to
determine
whether...
you
know,
to
determine
that.
i
mean,
i...
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
it
did
exist,
and...
and
the
reason
we
have
the
case
is
that
it
is
a
very
important
proposition
of
law,
which
the
ninth
circuit
adopted,
that
where
you
have
such
a
policy,
it
will
not
be
applicable
to
someone
who's
a
rehabilitated
drug
addict.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
reason
we
took
the
case,
and
you're
telling
us
we
can't
get
to
it
because...
because
in
fact
the
ninth
circuit
was
just
wrong
that
there
was
the
policy
at
all.
unknown
speaker
did...
did
you
raise
this
in
your...
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
that
particular
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
ninth
circuit,
i
take
it,
was
entitled
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
factual
determination
might
turn
out
as...
as
hughes
says
it
is,
and
it
then
went
on
and
gave
instructions
as
to
how
the
case
ought
to
be
resolved.
and
we
certainly
can
reach
that
if
we
think
it's
in
error.
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
exceed
its
authority
under
article
iii
in
making
the
statements
it...
it
did
with
respect
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
termination
policy?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
in
some
later
case
the
ninth
circuit
would...
would
say
that
this
is
not
binding
on
other
panels?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
facts
might
be
proven
from
the
record,
courts
of
appeals
routinely
give
directions
to
the
trial
courts
as
to
how
the
law
is
to
be
applied,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
all
right,
but
we
would
still
have
achieved
what
we
set
out
to
achieve,
and
that
is
to
determine
whether
the
statement
of
law
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
sets
forth
is
correct
or
not--
unknown
speaker
--that
if
there...
if
there
is
a
firing
solely
by
reason
of
policy,
it
is
nonetheless
invalid
as
applied
to
a
rehabilitated
drug
addict.
that's
an
important
proposition.
we
would
resolve
that
one
way
or
other,
even
though
your
case
might
continue
on.
so
what?
we
don't
care
whether
your
case
continues
on.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
care
a
lot.
i
know
that,
but
that's...
that's
not
what's
important
to
us.
unknown
speaker
undue
hardship
being
under
the
accommodation
requirement?
unknown
speaker
but
now,
the...
the
court
of
appeals
never
got
to
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
surely,
if
they
had
meant
the...
the
part
of
the...
the
part
of
the
act
that
requires
accommodation,
they
would
have
said
so.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you're
really
kind
of
rewriting
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
what
disability
would
you
be
accommodating?
unknown
speaker
he
doesn't
have
that
disability.
unknown
speaker
he
used
to
have
it
but
he
doesn't
have
it--
unknown
speaker
--he
is
in
fact
disabled,
but...
but
what...
what
disability
of
his
are
you
accommodating?
unknown
speaker
but
when
he
comes
back
years
later,
he's
not
disabled.
i
mean,
i
just
don't
see
how
it
fits.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
fit.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
says
is
not
really
presented
in
this
case,
though.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn't
address
section
112,
though.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
cite
it,
and
they
said
it's
not
a
disparate
impact
case,
too.
unknown
speaker
he's
only
discriminatorily
treated
because
he's
a
member
of
a...
of
a
specially
defined
class,
namely,
reformed
alcoholics
and...
and
drug-addicted
persons.
that
for
that
record
makes
him
a
disabled
person.
he's
kind
of
in
a
unique
class.
the...
the
court
of
appeals
really
did
not
focus
on
this
part
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
but
the
ruling
that
it
adopted,
as
i
understand
the
statute,
really
deprived
the
employer
of
an
opportunity
to...
to
set
forth
any
of
the
affirmative
defenses
that
would
be
available,
business
necessity,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
need
to
assert
those
defenses
if
someone
was
claiming
a
failure
to
accommodate,
and
if
that
was
not
what
was
before
the
house,
they'd
have
no
incentive
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
but
why
do
we
even
get
to
that?
this
is...
this
case
is
so
puzzling
on...
for
many
reasons,
but
one
thing
is
medina
or
medina
said
he
didn't
come
up
with
one
shred
of
proof
that
he's
no
longer
an
addict,
and
we
are
permitted...
being
an
addict
is
not
a
disability
within
the
ada,
being
an
addict.
being
a
reformed
addict
is.
so
said
this
employer,
look,
he
sent
a
letter...
he
sent
a
letter
from
his
church
pastor.
he
sent
a
letter
from
alcohol
anonymous.
maybe
that
shows
that
he's
no
longer
an
alcoholic,
but
there's
not
one
thing
here
that
says
he's
no
longer
addicted
to
cocaine.
and
there...
and
i
don't...
i
didn't
find
anything
either
that
said
that.
unknown
speaker
even
though
this
is...
this
is
solely
from
someone
who
knows
him
from
the
alcohol
program.
isn't
the
most
logical
assumption
if
he's
got
a
letter
from
an
aa
counselor,
that
what
they're
talking
about
is
alcohol
addiction?
unknown
speaker
the
inference
you
want
us
to
construe
in
his
favor
is
that
alcohol
means
things
other
than
alcohol.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
a
favorable
inference,
or
is
it
a
wild
leap
into
the...
into
the
dark?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
letter
so
we
can
look--
unknown
speaker
--sobriety.
unknown
speaker
really?
i...
i...
you...
you
refer
to
somebody
who's
a
recovered
drug
addict
as
he's
now
sober?
unknown
speaker
gee,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
sober
is...
refers
to
drunkenness.
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
drug
addict
is
stoned.
you
don't
say
he's--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
next
paragraph,
it
says,
alcohol
anonymous
has
been
demonstrated
the
best
recovery
tool
for
alcoholics.
unknown
speaker
and
it
says
he's...
he's
committed
to
this
program,
demonstrates
his
willingness
to
accept
responsibility
for
his
recovery.
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
summary
judgment
should
be
granted
is
a
question
of
law,
not...
not
a
question
of
fact.
and
so
the
same
arguments
can
be
made
in...
in
every
court
that's
considering
it
i
think.
unknown
speaker
the
weight
of
the
evidence
has
nothing
to
do
with
summary
judgment.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that
the...
what
the
plaintiff
claimed
is
a
witness.
the
plaintiff
says,
i've
had
this
whatever
the...
the
moment
was.
i
reached
rock
bottom
or
whatever
you
called
it,
and
i
woke
up
one
day
and
said
no
more
and
ever
since
then
i've
been
clean.
so
the...
so
the...
the
plaintiff
did...
that
was
the
only
proof.
that
might
not
be
very
convincing,
but
it
was
a
statement--
unknown
speaker
--well,
all
that
adds
up
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
disabled
when
he
reapplied.
he
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
nobody
is
arguing
that
he
was.
he
wasn't
disabled.
so
he
doesn't
fit
under
the
statute--
unknown
speaker
--as
a
disabled
person.
he
wasn't
regarded
as
because
he
wasn't
asked
to
take
a
test
or
anything.
i
mean,
he
just
doesn't
fit
under
the
definition
of
disability
in
the
statute.
so--
--but
he
had
a
record
of
disability,
which
makes
him
disabled
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
he's
still
addicted,
then
he's
not
protected
by
the
act.
unknown
speaker
mr.
montoya,
in
your...
you
say
now
that
you
question
the
existence
of
such
a
rule,
and
yet
you've
had
an
opportunity
for
discovery
in
the
district
court
and
you
didn't
try
to
pursue
any
kind
of
disparate
impact.
i...
i
don't
see
that
you
ever
asked
any
questions
about,
well,
let's
look
at
this
rule.
do
you
apply
it
to
people
who
were
let
go
for
stealing
or
whatever
other
reasons?
you
never,
never
tested
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
i
still
don't
understand
why
you
didn't
follow
up
those
two
depositions
with
interrogatories,
saying
what
is
the
origin
of
this
practice.
how
long
have
you
had
it?
to
whom
have
you
applied
it?
the
company
certainly
would
have
records
of
the
people
that
they've
discharged
for
cause,
how
many
of
them
had
applied
to
be
re-hired.
unknown
speaker
mr.
montoya,
i...
i
hope...
you
don't
have
much
time
left.
i
hope
you
will...
just
give
me
an
answer
to
the
only
question
in
this
case
that
i
care
about.
and
i
don't
care
about
all
these
factual
controversies.
they
can
be
sorted
out
later.
what
is
your
response
to
the
question
of
whether...
assuming
that
this
company
fired
your
client...
or
refused
to
rehire
your
client
because
he
had
been
fired
for
misconduct.
okay?
it
has
a
right
to
do
that,
and...
and
it
is
not
a...
an
instance
of
disparate
treatment.
what
is
your
response?
unknown
speaker
is
it
anything
other
than
the...
the
need
for
accommodating
a
disability?
is...
is
that
the
only
reason
why
it
is
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
that's
all...
those
are
all
categories
under
the
need
to
accommodate.
right?
unknown
speaker
apart...
apart...
assuming
that...
assuming
that
i
don't
think
that
issue
was
raised
in
the
case,
is
there
any
other
reason
why
it
would
have
been
unlawful,
assuming
that
they
were
simply
implementing
a
policy?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
montoya.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tuesday
the
fourteenth
of
october
at
10
o'clock.
