justice
breyer
because
you
can't
take
water
out
when
you're
thirsty.
there
are
too
many
thirsty
people
is
what
your
objection
is.
right?
justice
breyer
it
doesn't.
what
they
do
is
they...
they
build
a...
a
hole
which
fills
up
with
the
water
from
the
potomac
and
that
hole,
which
happens
to
be
in
virginia,
is
filled
up
with
water
and
they
drink
it.
now,
is
there
any
objection?
they
haven't
built
a
thing.
justice
breyer
no.
i'm
asking
you,
are
you
objecting
to
the
building
or
are
you
objecting
separately...
because
i
hadn't
focused
on
that...
to
just
taking
water
without
building
anything?
justice
breyer
no.
they
have
nothing
built
over
there.
what
happens
is
water
comes
up
out
of
the
potomac
into
virginia
and
they
drink
it.
justice
breyer
in
virginia.
justice
breyer
yes.
that's
what
i
thought
the
case
was
about.
unless
the
trench
creates
a
new
low-water
mark
for
the
potomac.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
what
maryland's
argument
would
be,
that
when
you
make
an
inlet
into
virginia,
that's...
that's
the
low-water
mark
of
the
potomac.
justice
breyer
i
didn't
want
to
get
it
mixed
up.
all
i
wanted
to
do
is
i
focused
on
this
case
as
a
matter
of
building
something.
i
didn't
focus
on
it
as
a
matter
of
taking
water
out.
and
i'm...
and
that's...
that
was
my
problem.
now,
maybe
just
forget
my
problem.
maybe
i'm
the
only
one
who
had
it.
so
skip--
--let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
there's
a
potomac
river
flow
allocation
agreement
of
1978.
does
it
deal
with
the
right
of
virginia
to
use
water
or
take
it
out?
justice
breyer
and
that's
here.
that's--
justice
breyer
but
i...
i
thought
when
justice
kennedy
pressed
you,
your...
you
ultimately
rested
on
federal
common
law.
justice
breyer
mr.
raphael,
what...
it's
your
position
that
if...
i
believe,
that
if
a
private
landowner,
riparian
owner
on
the
virginia
side,
the
southern
shore,
wants
to
build
a
pier
out
into
the
river,
that
pier
would
be
permitted
by
virginia?
justice
breyer
why?
justice
breyer
and
for
that
answer,
i
take
it,
you...
you
do
rest
on
article
vii
of
the
1785
compact.
justice
breyer
yes.
justice
breyer
what
about
operating
a
fishing
pier,
charging
for...
who...
who
would
have
the
authority
to
tax
the
fishing
pier?
is
that
a
riparian
use
or
not
riparian?
justice
breyer
yes.
i
tried
to
pick
one.
