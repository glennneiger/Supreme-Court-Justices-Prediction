mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
amended
the
indian
civil
rights
act
in
response
to
this
court's
invitation
in
duro,
congress
exceeded
its
power
by
overruling
this...
this
court's
determination
on
the
limits
of
tribal
sovereignty.
the
tribal
power
that
congress
can
give
and
take
away
cannot
by
definition
be
a
sovereign
power.
the
tribal
court,
acting
without
its
own
sovereign
authority,
prosecuted
billy
jo
lara
using
this
federal
authority,
and
his
subsequent
federal
prosecution,
therefore,
double...
violated
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
your
honor,
i
believe
that
congress'
intent
was
clear
on
two
points.
the
first
point
was
that
they
were
attempting
to
restore
tribal
sovereignty,
which
they
cannot
do
by
its
definition.
but
they
were
also
clearly
trying
to
close
a
jurisdictional
gap,
a
jurisdictional
loophole.
under
the
government's
contention,
the
entire
statute
should
be
thrown
out
and
neither
one
of
those
clear
intents
from
congress
can
be
saved.
but
under
the...
under
what
the
eighth
circuit
did
and
under
what
i'm
asking
this
court
to
do,
the...
one
of
those
intents
can
be
saved
and
that
is--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--and
if
this
court
was
to
determine
that
this
is
a...
that
this
is
not
a
delegation
and
that
this
court
determines
that
the
statute
cannot
be
saved,
then
mr.
lara
still
was
prosecuted
in
the
tribal
court.
he
was
still
prosecuted
under
color
of
law.
he
served
90
days
in
the
tribal
jail
on
this
offense,
155
days
total.
the
tribal
court
believed
it
was
acting
properly.
it
was
told
by
congress.
congress
is
the
body
which
tells
the
tribe
what
to
do.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
i
don't
believe
that
it's
novel.
there
is...
this
court
has
not
ruled
that
a
court
without
jurisdiction
can,
therefore,
subject
some...
can
subject
somebody
to
initial
jeopardy
in
the
double
jeopardy
sense.
but
the
fifth
amendment
clearly...
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
protect
against
dual
investigations
or
dual
prosecutions.
it
protects
against
dual
punishment,
and
mr.
lara
has
been
punished.
he
served
90
days
in
jail.
congress
can't
now--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
congress
can...
could
always
give
it
back
under
a
delegation.
congress
always
has
the
power
to--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--what
congress
takes
away
and
congress
gives
back
is
a
power
of
congress.
it
can't
be
a
reaffirmation
of
a
tribal
sovereign
power.
that
which--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--i
think
technically
they
would,
but
in
that
situation
it's...
it's
not
so
important
whether
they're
using
a
delegated
power
or
a
sovereign
power
because
this
case
presents
unique
facts
where
sovereignty
becomes
of
paramount
importance
because
of
this
court's
adoption
of
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine.
in
many
instances,
congress
delegates
authority
and
it...
the
importance
of
whether
it
be
a
delegation
or
whether
it
be
a...
a
re-recognition
or
a
restoration
of
inherent
tribal
sovereignty
is
not
nearly
as
important.
and
in
that
case,
i
think
it
would
be
a
delegation
of
federal
power,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
affect
the
election
of
the
tribal
chairmen.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
when
congress
acts
with...
as
it
acts
towards
puerto
rico,
it
can
use
its
treaty
powers
and
not
be
conferring
sovereign
power
on
puerto
rico.
and
puerto
rico
is
considerably--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--to
address
that,
puerto
rico
is
different
than
a
state
and
puerto
rico
and
states
are
very
different
from
tribes.
tribes
are
dependent
nations.
they
are
a
unique
body
within
our
constitutional
framework.
and
when
congress
acts
in
relation
to
tribes,
they
can
act
in
a
number
of
different
ways.
in
fact,
congress
can
completely
take
away
a
tribe's
sovereignty,
but
it
cannot
restore
that
sovereignty
once
it's...
it
has
taken
it
away.
the
reason
that
this...
the
reason
that
this
is--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--i
believe
that
that
would
be
a
delegation
of
congress'
power.
once
it
has
taken
something
away,
it
cannot
give
it
back.
and
powers
which
are...
which
are
sovereign
cannot
be
defined
as
sovereign
when--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--i
would
look
to
oliphant
or
to
united
states
v.
sioux
nation
or
the
alcea
band
of
the
tillamook
tribe
wherein
this
court
said
congress'
plenary
power
is
not
absolute.
congress...
this
court
has
often
said
congress
has
plenary
power,
but
that
plenary
power
is
not
absolute.
and
one
of
the...
one
of
the
most
important
limitations
on
congress'
power
with
regard
to
indian
tribes
is
that
it
must
be
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
constitution.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
the--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--if
i
could
just...
it's
this
court
that
said
that
that...
that
recognized...
and
its
role
is
to
say
what
the
law
is...
looked
at
the
dependent
nature
of
the
indian
tribes
and
said
this
does
not
exist.
this
power
to
prosecute--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--correct.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
yes,
but
congress
can
always
give
back
using
their
plenary
power.
congress
can
always
delegate
powers
back
to
the
tribes.
it
simply
cannot
make
sovereign
that
which
is
not.
that
which
is--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--it's
a
result,
your
honor,
of
their
accepting
the
dependent...
accepting
the
protection
and
the
benefits
and
the
burdens
of
the
united
states.
and
that
boils
down
to
the
essential
question
which
is
who
has
the...
who
has
the
final
authority
on
what
the
limits
on
inherent
sovereignty
are.
is
it
this
body
or
is
it
congress?
and--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--that's
right,
and--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--and
billy
jo
lara
was
prosecuted
using
federal
power,
and
that's...
and
that's
the
premise.
he...
when
he
was
prosecuted
by
the
tribe,
he
was
prosecuted
using
federal
power.
and
then
his
subsequent
prosecution
in
the
federal
court--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--to
billy
jo
lara
as
a
non-member
of
the
tribe?
i
think
that
it
should
apply.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
because
this
court
said
in
united
states
v.
wheeler
that
the...
the
member
of
a
tribe
has
accepted
the
benefits
and
the
burdens
of
being
a
member
of
that
tribe,
and
one
of
the
burdens
is
that
the
bill
of
rights
does
not
apply.
and
at
any
time
that
tribal
member
can
decide
to
leave
his
or
her
tribe
and
no
longer
be
a
member,
no
longer
accept
the
benefits
and
no
longer
accept
the
burdens,
which
is
the
fundamental
unfairness
of
either
placing
a
non-indian
or
a
non-member
indian
before
a
tribal
court
which
does
not
give
that
person
their
full
constitutional
rights.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
your
honor,
as
i
understand
your
question,
you're
looking
for
where
in
the
constitution
congress
has
the
power
or
this...
or
this
body
has
the
power.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
congress
has
specific
enumerated
powers
in
the
constitution.
nowhere
in
those
specific
enumerated
powers...
and
the
government
has
pointed
to
no
specific
enumerated
powers
that
allows
congress
to
take
the
action
they
did.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
in
the
treaty
clause.
and
congress
and
the
executive
branch
can
have
relations
with
other
nations
through
the
treaty
clause
and
can
define
their
relation.
but
this
court
has
said
that
dealings
with
the
tribe
is
more
than
treaties
and
more
than
statutes,
that
it
also
depends
on
the
relationship
of
the
tribes
to
this
dependent
nation.
and
in
giving
their...
in...
in
accepting
the
protection
of
the
united
states,
the
tribes
accepted
the
burdens
and
necessarily
gave
up
certain
aspects
of
their
sovereignty.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
i'm
not
sure
that
it
was...
if
it
was
unconstitutional
or
not,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
important
distinction,
your
honor.
what
the
important
distinction
is
is
where
does
this
power
to
now
deal
with
indian
tribes
and
to...
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
define
sovereignty
and
take
any
role
that
this
court
has
in
defining
sovereignty
away.
under
the
government's
analysis--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--but
congress--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--and
congress
is
already
attempting
to...
with
the
hicks
fix
to
overrule
hicks,
montana,
and
oliphant.
and
if
this
court
gives
to
congress
all
the
powers
that
the
government
is
asking
them
to--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--but
mr.
lara
owes
no
allegiance
whatsoever
to
the
spirit
lake
sioux
tribe.
he's
a
member
of
a
different
tribe.
using...
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
just
like
any
other
indian.
he
receives
no
benefits
from
the
spirit
lake
sioux
tribe.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
in...
and
thank
you.
[laughter]
the...
and
it
is...
it
is
critically
important
to
look
at
what
a
tribe...
what
powers
a
tribe
exerts
over
its
members
and
what...
what
somebody
who
is
a
member
of
a
tribe
traveling
across
the
country,
traveling
across
an
interstate
highway
and
is
not
a
member
of
that
tribe,
comes
onto
a
reservation
for
no
reason
other
than
to
get
through
that
reservation--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--because
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
that
position,
then
there
would
be
no
reason
not
to
subject
non-indians
to
tribal
jurisdiction
as
well.
that's
a
contact--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--criminal...
criminal
jurisdiction
is
significantly
different
than
civil
jurisdiction.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
i
believe
that
that's
in
my
brief,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
that
cite
in
front
of
me.
the...
but
in...
in
duro
this
court
said
that
in
the
criminal...
that
the
criminal
context
is
unique,
and
that
in
the...
in
the
realm
of
criminal
law,
we
must
first
look...
no
matter
what
we
think
of
history,
no
matter
what
our
interpretation
is
of
history
and
statutes
and
treaties,
this
must
be
examined
under
the
guise
that
billy
jo
lara,
or
in
that
case
albert
duro,
is
a
citizen
first
and
foremost
of
the
united
states.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
and...
and
it's
interesting.
the
government
says
in
numerous
instances
that
habeas
relief
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
this
court
recognized
in
duro
that
habeas
is
not
an
appropriate
remedy,
and
it's
not
for
two
reasons,
the
first
being
habeas
relief
requires
an
in-custody...
has
an
in-custody
requirement.
mr.
lara
is
quickly
out
of
custody.
and
without
a
lawyer,
how
can
one
be
expected
to
raise
complex
federal
rights
such
as
habeas?
when
one
walks
into
a
courtroom,
one
does
not
walk
in
and
say--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--but
it's
not
required
to
step
into
a
courtroom
in
the
united
states
and
say
before
this
proceeding
starts,
i
want
to
invoke
all
of
my
rights.
those
rights
must
be
waived.
and
at
no
point
were
these...
were
these
rights
waived
by
mr.
lara.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
this
court
has
said
that...
that
prosecuting
a
member
on
his
own
tribe
is
okay
because
he
has...
he
has
consented
to
that.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
no--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--it
would
be
wonderful
if
tribes
were
the
same,
but
tribes
are
not.
tribes
are
distinctly
different.
to
say
that
the...
that
somebody
in...
an
indian
in
alaska
is
going
to
know
what
the
criminal
laws
in
the
state
of
florida
are
going
to
be
is
simply
not
the
case.
he's
not
going
to
understand
the
customs.
he...
this
person
would
not
have
had
any
input
into
the
tribal
council,
what
the
laws
were,
who
the
judges--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--because
a
criminal
defendant
in
louisiana
under
your...
under
your
example
would
have
the
full
benefit
of
the
bill
of
rights
which
a...
which
an
indian
does
not
have
in
tribal
courts.
and
that's
the
difference.
they
would...
he
would...
that
person
would
have
a
louisiana
lawyer
who
understood
louisiana
law
and
could
speak
on
his
behalf.
gideon
v.
wainwright
is...
there
is
wonderful
language
in
there,
talking
about
how
important
it
is
to
have
a
lawyer.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
because
mr.
lara
was
prosecuted
under
the
color
of
law.
he
was
prosecuted.
he
went
to
jail
for
90
days,
and
he--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--and
mr.
lara
never
attacked
his...
his
judgment.
the
government
is
attacking
his
judgment,
coming
in...
he...
he
never
attacked
his
judgment.
now
the
government
is
coming
in
attacking
his
judgment
collaterally
in
order
to
exact
a
more
harsh
sentence
in
federal
court.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
no,
i
am
not,
your
honor.
no,
i
am
not.
and...
and
the
tribe,
acting
under
the
direction
of
congress
which
has
control
over
the
indian
reservations,
acting
under
what
they
thought
was
a
valid
statute,
acting
under
a
statute
that
would
not
be
invalid
until
this
court
speaks,
was
placed
in
jail
and
has
suffered
the
constraints
of
being
in
jail,
then
was
subsequently
prosecuted
by
that
same
body
by
congress
and
was
indicted
and
now
is
going
to
be
prosecuted
a
second
time.
the
government
can't
rewrite
the
logs
of
the
jail.
he
was
there
and
he...
and
the
fact
that
he
was
punished
is
clear.
for
these
reasons,
i
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
to
find
that
billy
jo's...
billy
jo
lara's
subsequent
federal
prosecution
violated
double
jeopardy.
thank
you.
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
the...
the--
mr.
alexander
f.
reichert
--no.
in
fact...
no,
there
is
not.
and
historically
there
wouldn't
have
been.
they
are
two
tribes
that
were
bitter
enemies
throughout
history
and--
