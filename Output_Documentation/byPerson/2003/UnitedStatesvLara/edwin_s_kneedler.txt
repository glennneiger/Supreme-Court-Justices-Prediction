mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
14
years
ago
in
the
duro
decision
this
court
held
that
under
the
state
of
indian
law,
as
it
then
stood,
and
indian
tribe
could
not
prosecute
an
indian
who
was
not
a
member
of
that
tribe.
the
court
recognized,
though,
that
its
decision
might
create
a
jurisdictional
gap
on
many
reservations,
but
the
court
concluded
that
if
the
present
jurisdictional
regime
proves
insufficient
to
meet
the
needs
of
reservation
law
enforcement,
the
proper
body
to
address
that
concern
is
congress,
which
has
plenary
power
over
indian
affairs.
congress
responded
immediately
to
this
court's
decision.
it...
it
conducted
an
extensive
inquiry
and
heard
hearings
about
the
consequences
of
the
court's
decision
and
heard
strong
expressions
of
concern
by
many
indian
tribes,
by
the
federal
government,
and
by
numerous
states
about
the
law
enforcement
vacuum
that
would
be
created
over
many
misdemeanor
offenses
on
indian
reservations.
and
there
was
widespread
support
for
congress
to
restore
the
power
to
indian
tribes
to
exercise
their
sovereign
power
to
prosecute
non-member
indians.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
the
answer
lies
in...
in
the
longstanding
jurisdictional
regime
on
indian
reservations.
going
back
to
1817,
the
general
indian
crimes
statute
has
authorized
prosecutions
by
the
federal
government
over
crimes
committed
by
non-indians,
including
misdemeanor
crimes,
and
so
there
was
not
a
jurisdictional
void.
the
difficulty
came...
the...
the
most
acute
difficulty
came
from
the
fact
that
that
statute,
again
since
the
earliest
times,
had...
has
exempted
crimes
committed
by
one
indian
against
the
person
or
property
of
another.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
congress
could
have
done
so,
but
congress,
with
the
plenary
power
over
indian
affairs,
chose...
decided
that
the
proper
course
or
the
most
appropriate
course
was
to
have
that
jurisdiction
exercised
by
the
indian
tribes.
and
congress
heard
considerable...
considerable
evidence
that
that
power
had
long,
in
fact,
been
exercised
by
indian
tribes
over
other
indians
who
were
not
members
of
the
particular
tribe.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it...
generally,
it
has
been
understood
to
require
a
tribal
affiliation.
first
of
all,
the
definition
under...
under
the
indian
civil
rights
act
for
tribal
power,
congress
adopted
the
same
meaning
of
indian
that
is
applied
under
the
federal
criminal
statutes
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
two
mesh
completely.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
under
that,
obviously,
someone
who
is
an
enrolled...
formally
enrolled
member
would
be
an
indian,
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
footnote
7
of
its
antelope
decision,
the...
that
provision
has
not
been
construed
to
require
that
strictly,
that
ordinarily
someone
who
is
an
indian
and
has
a
tribal
affiliation
and
is
recognized
by
the
tribe
is
also
regarded
as
an
indian.
in
this
case,
though,
we
have
a
situation
where
someone
who
is
an
enrolled
member
of
another
tribe.
so
questions
about
the...
about
the...
how
the
statute
should
be
construed
or
applied
in
situations
where
there's
not
one...
someone
who's
formally
a
member
are...
are
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
under
this
court's
decision,
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
this
court's
decision
in
talton
v.
mayes
said
that
the
fifth
amendment
did
not
apply
to
the
exercise
of
powers
by
indian
tribes,
and
that's
been
understood
to
apply
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it...
it
may
be,
but...
but
it's
important
to
recognize
what...
what
congress
has
also
done
here
was
to
enact
the
indian
civil
rights
act
which
extends
to
indian
tribes
many
of
the
requirements
of
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
all
of
them,
but
congress
in
1968
examined
the
question
of
the...
of
the
rights
of...
of
indians
and
others
subject
to
tribal
jurisdiction
and...
and
applied
the...
the
provisions
of
the...
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
so
there...
the...
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't...
i
don't
believe
they
are
before
the
court.
what
was
before
the...
those...
those
questions
go
to
what
restraints
are
on
the
tribe
itself
when
it's
exercising
its
own
power.
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
really
on
the
separate
ground
of
what
happens
when
you
have,
first,
the
tribe
exercising
its
sovereign
power
and
then
the
united
states
exercising
power
after
that
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
it
depends
what
one
means
by
delegation.
the
word
delegation
is...
is
used
in
a
variety
of
ways.
i
mean,
for...
for
example,
it's
common
to
speak
of
congress
delegating
power
to
an
executive
agency
to
carry
out
a
certain
function,
but
when
the
executive
agency
does
this,
it's
not
exercising
congressional
power.
it's
exercising
power
that
congress
in
its
plenary
authority
has...
has
conferred
on
the
executive
branch
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
then
execute
those
laws.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
i...
i
was
using
that
by
analogy
to
say
that
the
word
delegate
is...
is
often
used,
including
in
this
court's
opinions
i
think,
in
a...
in
a
somewhat
looser
sense
in
terms
of...
of
authorizing
someone
else
to
act.
but
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
and
that's...
i
think
that's
exactly
what
congress
did
in
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
it...
it
require...
and...
and
this
court
said
in
wheeler
and
has
said
in
numerous
other
decisions
that
congress
has
plenary
power
over
the
exercise
of
a
tribe's
own
sovereign
powers.
and
what
congress
did
in
the
indian
civil
rights
act
was
precisely
to
regulate
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i...
i
think
there...
there
are
several
responses
to
that
point.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
matters
a
lot
whether
one
views
the
limitations
on
tribal
power
as
mandated
by
the
constitution
or
as
a
product
of
federal
common
law.
and
in...
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i...
i...
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
correct
because
i
think
if
it...
if
it
is
not...
if
this
conception
is
not
constitutionally
mandated,
then
congress
has
the
authority,
the
plenary
authority,
over
indian
affairs
to
regulate,
to
modify
tribal
jurisdiction.
and...
and
in
fact,
i
think
that...
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i...
i
believe
that's...
that's
an
expression
of
the
dependency
or
a
manifestation
of
the
dependency,
not
in
derogation
of
it,
because
dependent
means
that
your
ability
to
exercise
authority...
in
this
case,
the
indian
tribe
is
always
subject
to
the
overriding
powers
of
the
federal
government.
and
what
this
court
said
precisely
in
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
it...
if...
if
one
looks
back
at
the
oliphant
decision,
what
the
court
there
described
its...
its
undertaking
was
was
essentially
a...
a...
an
articulation
of
what
it
called
indian
law
which
is
a...
a
combination
of
judge-made
law
but
against
the
backdrop
of
treaties
and
statutes.
those
treaties
and
statutes
are
not
themselves
embodying
constitutionally
mandated
rules.
they
are
the
product
of
the
political
branches.
they
sometimes
don't
answer
precise
questions,
and
this
court
is
required
to
articulate
judicial
principles
as
best
it
can
against
the
backdrop
of
those
principles.
but
because
those
principles
themselves
are
traced
to
treaties
and
statutes,
it
must
be
up
to...
congress
must
have
the
authority
to
modify
those
rules,
and
that's
consistent
with
its
plenary
power
over
indian
affairs.
what
this
court
said
in
the
montana
decision,
which...
which
has
been
identified
as
the
path-marking
decision
over...
concerning
jurisdiction
over
non-tribal
members,
was
what
tribes
lost
by
virtue
of
their
dependent
status
was
the
power
independently
to
determine
their
external
relations.
this
is
not
what
we
have
here--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
no,
it
isn't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
is
not
a
unilateral
assertion
of
tribal
power.
this
court
held
in...
in
oliphant
and
duro,
by
looking
at
the...
at
the
backdrop
of...
of
statutory
enactments,
that
its
power
had
been
limited,
but...
and
the
tribe
did
not
unilaterally
overcome
that.
what
congress
did
was
lift
the
limits
so
that
the
tribe...
the
tribe
would
then
be
authorized
to
exercise
sovereign
power
that
it
previously
had...
had
had.
and
it's
in
that...
it's
directly
analogous
to
two
important
examples
that
i
think
are
very
instructive
here.
one
is
that
constitution
itself
in
the
commerce
clause
has
been
held
to,
of
its
own
force,
preempt
state
laws
in
the
interstate
commerce
and
also
in
the
indian
commerce
clause
area.
but
congress
can,
in
the
exercise
of
its
authority
over
commerce
under
either
one,
lift
those
restrictions
and
authorize
states
to
regulate
in
areas
they
otherwise
could
not
do.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but...
but
the
point
is
that
in
that
situation,
even
when
the
constitution
itself
has,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
limited
state
authority,
congress
can
lift
that.
the
other...
the
other
example--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i'm...
i'm
not
speaking
of
bill...
bill
of
rights
provisions.
i'm
speaking
of
congress'
article
i
power.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
under...
under
this
court's
decision...
decisions,
congress
has
been
authorized
to
allow
states
to
regulate
in
areas
it...
it
would
otherwise
not
be
able
to,
and
when
it
does
so,
it's
exercising
its
own
sovereign
power,
not
power
delegated
by
the
federal
government.
the
other...
the
other
instructive
example
is
public
law
280.
since
the
outset
of
the
constitution,
really
by
the...
by
carrying
forward
arrangements
of...
in
indian
law
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
states
have
not
been
able
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
matters
involving
indians
in
indian
country
absent
an
affirmative
authorization
by
congress.
in
public
law
280
congress
lifted
those
limitations
and
authorized
tribes
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
indians
and
others
in
indian
country.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
excuse
me.
authorized
states.
and
in
doing
so,
those
states
are
not
exercising
delegated
federal
power.
congress
lifted
a
barrier
to
the
exercise
by
states
of
their
own
sovereign
power
to
prosecute
according
to
their
laws.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
i
agree
with
your
result.
i...
i
think
conceptually
what
i
would
say
is
dependent
defines
the
relationship
between
the
tribe
and
the
national
government--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
this
case
congress.
and...
and
congress
in
the...
in
the
exercise
of
its
superior
sovereignty
is...
is
defining
the
contours
of
the
dependent
sovereign's
authority.
so
it...
it
is
a
manifestation
of
the
dependent
relationship.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i...
i
think
that's
right.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the...
this
court
held
in
wheeler
that
prosecution
by
an
indian
tribe
of
a...
of
a
member
of
the
tribe
in
that
situation,
followed
by
a
prosecution
by
the
federal
government
for
what
would...
the
same
conduct,
was
not
the
same
offense
because
the
ultimate
authority
to
prosecute
derived
from
different
sources.
and
we
think
the
same--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it...
i...
i
think
by
inherent
what
the
court
meant
in
both
oliphant
and...
and
in
duro
was
original
sovereignty
that
has
continued
unlimited
or
unrestricted
down
to
the
present
day.
in
other
words,
it...
it
has
been...
it
has
been
allowed
to
continue,
and
in
that
sense
it's
inherent
in
being--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if...
if
we...
if
we
look
at
the
reality
of
the
nature
of
the
prosecutions
here,
this
was
a
prosecution
brought
by
tribal
officials
in
a
tribally
constituted
court
enforcing
provisions
of
tribal
law,
not
title
18,
under
a
tribal
constitution.
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
i...
i
believe
the...
this
court's
decision
in...
in
oliphant
says
so
in
several
respects.
what
the
court...
in
several
locations.
what
the
court
said
in
oliphant
is
that
the...
the
tribes
necessarily
lost
their
dependent...
excuse
me...
by
virtue
of
their
dependent
status,
lost
their
ability
to
prosecute
non-indians
except
in
a
manner
acceptable
to
congress.
so
the...
the
court
necessarily
assumed
that
congress
could
revest
this
authority
in
the
indian
tribes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
several
things.
first
of
all,
the...
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
under
this
court's
decision
in
talton
probably
would
not
apply
of
its
own
force
to
the
tribe.
but
what
does
apply
is
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
what...
congress
filled
that
void
by...
by...
as
a
statutory
matter
requiring
that
certain
rights
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
i...
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i
think...
i
think
in
asking
a
due
process
question,
you
might
be
asking...
a
procedural
due
process
question,
you
might
be
asking
an
equal
protection
type
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right...
right
to
counsel
is
not...
is
not
expressly
guaranteed
by
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
if
there
is
a
particular
prosecution
that
is
found
to
violate
fundamental
fairness
because
of
the
absence
of
counsel,
the
indian
civil
rights
act
would...
would
provide
a
vehicle
for
that
argument.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
with...
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
members
of
tribes
other
than
the
prosecuting
tribe,
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
plenary
authority
over
tribes
we
think
certainly
should
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
relationship
among
tribes,
tribes
with
each
other,
and
relationships
of
tribes
and
their
respective
members
with
each
other.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
what
congress
has
done
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
would
not.
and
that's...
that
is
another...
there...
there
are
really
two
different
questions.
one,
can
someone
be
subjected
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
when
he's
not
participating
in
the...
in
the
process
there?
and
that
happens
all
the
time
when
people
are
prosecuted
in
another
jurisdiction.
there's
a
separate
question
of...
of
what
procedural
protections
would
be
afforded
in
such
a
trial,
and
that's
where
the
indian
civil
rights
act
steps
in.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
that's
correct.
in
fact,
it's
a
necessary...
he
has
to
accept
the
validity
of
his...
of
his
prior
prosecution
and...
and
leave
it
standing
in
order
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there...
there's
i
think
another
important
point
to
be
made
about
the
nature
of
congress'
powers
in
this
area.
to
say
that
an
indian
tribe
could
only
prosecute
a
non-member...
a
non-member
indian
through
the
exercise
of
delegated
federal
power
would
itself
be
a...
a
substantial
constitutional
anomaly.
i
think
it's
important
to...
to
consider
the
scope
of
congress'
plenary
powers
within
the
framework
of
the
structure
of
the
constitution
itself.
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i...
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
did
not...
i
did
not
mean
to
say...
to
say
that.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
i
think
oliphant
contemplates
that.
what
rights
would
attach
is...
is
a
separate
question.
but
i...
but
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
distinct
authority
for
congress
to
regulate
or
to
permit
a
tribe
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
members
of
other
tribes.
this
is
a
power
that
has
historically
been
left
to
tribes
by
the
federal
statutory
regime
in
indian
country
since
1817
down
to
the
present
time.
there
is
still
an
exception--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
no.
that
has
continued
up
to
the
present
time.
there
is
still
an
exception
in
the
statutory
regime
for
tribes
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i
believe
it
is.
in...
in
duro
itself,
the
court
said
that
citizenship
does
not
detract
from
congress'
plenary
power
over
indian
affairs.
the...
the
last
point
i
wanted
to
make
and
then
i
would
like
to
reserve
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
here
we're
talking
about...
this
case
involves
non-member
indians,
and
as
i
said,
the
ability
of
congress
to
regulate
relationships
between
tribes
and...
and
their
members
would
seem
to
be
at
the
core
of
the
power.
and
as
this
court
has
said
in
its
federalism
cases,
it
would
be
a...
a
mixing
of
sovereignty
to
regard
the
states
as
mere
agents
of
the
federal
government.
they
are
separate
sovereigns,
and
we
think
the
same
is
true--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
again,
in
our...
in
our
view,
the
dependency
describes
congress'
power
to
regulate
and
limit
and
prescribe
the
rights
available
in
tribal
courts.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
this
case
only
involves
the
question
of
whether
congress
can
authorize
tribes
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
indians
who
are
members
of
other
tribes
or
affiliated
with
other
tribes,
not
non-member
indians.
and
that...
that
point
is
significant
because
it
calls
into...
into
play
additional
powers
that
congress
has
in
this
area
particularly
defining
the
attributes
of
membership
in
a
tribe.
congress
has...
among
those
attributes
are
the
eligibility
for
special
benefits,
educational
benefits,
health
benefits,
housing
benefits.
so
someone
from
another
tribe--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i
think...
i
think
it
would...
yes,
it
would
be.
someone
always
would
have
the...
the
ability
to
disavow
his...
his
indian
affiliation.
i
think
that
would
be
an
important
part
of
it.
but...
so
what
congress
has
done
here
is
simply
to
identify
another
attribute
of
membership
or
affiliation
with
a
tribe,
which
is
that
if
you're
on
another
tribe's
reservation,
you
will
be
subject
to
that
tribe's
criminal
jurisdiction.
and
that
is
important
to
law
and
order
on
many
reservations,
as
congress
itself
realized
when
it
enacted
this
statute
in
1991.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
he
could
not...
i...
i
think
he...
as
long
as
he
was
affiliated
at
the
time
of
the
conduct,
i
think...
i
think
the...
the
consequences
would...
would
flow
from
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
i...
i
think...
i
think
congress
at
least
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
could
allow
a
tribe
to
maintain
jurisdiction
over
something
that
happened
while
the
person
was
tribally
affiliated.
the...
another
fundamental
point
is
the
one
that
justice
breyer
mentioned
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
prohibits,
the
places
a
limit
in
this
situation
on
congress'
exercise
of
its
plenary
power
over
indian
affairs.
and
in
fact,
there's
much
in
the
constitution
that
points
to
the
contrary.
the
constitution
refers
to
the
indian
tribes,
and
as
this
court
has
said,
that
reference
to
tribes
and
to
the
treaty-making
power
recognizes
tribes
as
sovereigns,
not
simply
voluntary
organizations,
but
in
the
constitution
itself
recognizes
them
as
sovereigns.
and
the
court
has
said
that
because
of
those
powers
and
implicit
from
that
is
the
power
of
congress
to
exercise
protective
authority
over
indian
tribes.
and
here
that
protection
includes
protection
of
tribal...
tribes
from
crimes
committed
by
other
tribal
members.
in
solving
this
serious
law
enforcement
problem,
congress
was
entitled
to
be
guided
by
the
constitution
itself
which
recognizes
the
tribes
as
sovereign
and
to
vest
authority
in
them
as
sovereign
rather
than
act
in
derogation
of
the
constitution
by
deeming
the
tribes
to
be
agents
of
the
federal
government
when
a
tribal
prosecutor
is
bringing
a
prosecution
under
tribal
law
in...
in
tribal
court.
and
congress
could
rationally
reach
this
conclusion
for
another
important
reason,
and
that
is
the
lesson
in
history.
history
is
very
important
in
indian
affairs,
and
congress
throughout
history,
since
1817
under
a
jurisdictional
regime
that
remains
in
effect,
has
left
to
tribes
the
power
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
members
of
other
tribes,
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
v.
rodgers
where
it
construed
the
indian
against
indian
exception
as
intended
to
allow
tribe
matters
not...
and
it
expressly
said,
not
only
with...
with
their
own
tribe
but
other
tribes,
to
be
left
to
the
tribe.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
a
title
18
offense?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
i
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that...
that
would...
that...
that
might
present
a...
a
separate
problem,
but
if
the...
because
there...
it
might
be
the
same
offense.
