unknown
speaker
why
didn't...
why
didn't
they
extend
it
to
non-indians?
i
mean,
if
it's
a
problem
when
a...
a
non-member
indian
commits
an
offense
on
an
indian
reservation,
why
isn't
it
an
equivalent
problem
when
a...
a
white
man
commits
the
same
crime
on
an
indian
reservation?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
they
have
changed
that?
they
could
have
solved
the
problem
by
simply
treating
non-member
indians
the
same
way
they
treat
non-indians.
unknown
speaker
what's--
--there's
some
ambiguity
about
what
indian
refers
to.
is
it...
must
it
be
someone
who
is
enrolled
in
an
indian
tribe
or
can
it
be
anyone
who
is
the
child
of
indian
parents?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
is
that?
what
is
that
definition?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
is
it
the
case
that
the
bill
of
rights
is...
has
not
been
thought
applicable
to
criminal
defendants
who
are
members
of
the
tribe
in
a
tribal
court
or
to
non-tribal
indian...
non-tribal
member
indians?
unknown
speaker
in...
in
tribal
court.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
perhaps
one
reason
why
congress
didn't
go
ahead
and
subject
non-indians
to
tribal
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
but
not
all.
unknown
speaker
should
we
consider
in
this
case
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
arguments
that
are--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
suppose
under
one
view
of
the
case...
and
it's...
it's
not
your
view...
if
this
were
deemed
to
be
a
delegated
power,
then
the
absence
or
the...
the
presence
of
obligations
under
the
bill
of
rights
would
become
very
important.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
it--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
is
exercising
the
power
of
the
united
states
as
distinct
from
the
power
of
some
other
sovereign.
and...
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the...
as
i
understand
it,
is...
is
whether
the
tribe
is
exercising
its
own
power
or
the
power
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
authorized...
exercising
its
own
power,
how
then
can
congress
make
the
bill
of
rights
applicable.
as...
as
a
condition
to
the
exercise
of
sovereignty?
is
that
the
way
it
works?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
raise
the...
the
point
that
is...
is
the
greatest
trouble
for
me
so...
so
you
perhaps
could
address
that?
because
it
follows
from
what
justice
kennedy
has
raised.
as
i
understand
what
we
held...
forget
our
language
about
delegation
for
a
minute.
as
i
understand
what
we
held
in
oliphant,
which
we
followed
in
duro,
was
that
the
very
concept
of...
of
this
dependent
or
subordinate
sovereignty
that
tribes
are...
are
understood
to
have,
the
way
we
look
at
indian
issues,
is
inconsistent
with
the
exercise
of
tribal
jurisdiction
over
a...
a
non-member.
whether
that
notion
of
subordinate
or...
or
dependent
sovereignty
is
constitutional
or
common
law
doesn't
really
matter.
as
long
as
we're
going
to
have
that
concept,
that
concept
is
inconsistent
with
the
exercise
of
the
tribe's
own
sovereign
jurisdiction
over
a...
a
non-tribal
member.
if
we
are
going
to
stick
with
that
concept
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
got
to
understand
the
statute
in
question
here
as
a
statute
that
confers
federal
power
on
the
tribe
as
distinct
from
one
that
restores
the
tribe's
sovereign
power
because
the
tribe
can't
have
the
sovereign
power
as
long
as
we
are
going
to
understand
that
tribe
to
have
this
subordinate
sovereignty.
and
therefore,
for
me
the
concepts
that
we're
using
pretty
much
force
the
conclusion
that
the...
that
the
power
that's
being
exercised
is
federal
not
indian.
could
you
comment
on...
on
that
analysis?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
whether
we
can
change
our
conceptualization
about
dependent
sovereignty,
but
as
long
as
we
keep
that
conceptualization,
it
seems
to
me
we've
got
to
accept
the
conclusion
that...
that
i
suggested.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
if
it
does
so,
we
have
to
accept
the...
if
we're
going
to
follow
that
route,
we
will
have
to
accept
the
conclusion
that
the
whole
concept
of
dependent
sovereignty
has...
has
been
modified
in...
in
some
way
because
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that...
if
that
were
all
we
meant
in
oliphant,
we
would
have
said
the...
the
federal
government
could
take
away
this
power
by
statute.
we
didn't
say
the
federal
government
could
take
away
the
power
by
statute.
we
said
it
is
gone
by
virtue
of
the...
the
sovereignty
relationship.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't...
isn't
that
what
we're
talking
about--
unknown
speaker
--when
we
talk
about
sovereign
power?
unknown
speaker
and
that
has
always
been
thought
to
be
a
great
anomaly
that
a
constitutional
requirement
could
be
eliminated
by
a
federal
statute.
i...
i
hope
you're
not
urging
that
as...
as
a
rule
which
should
be
followed.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's...
let's
apply
that
across
the
board
then.
i
guess
congress
can
lift
the
fifth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
clearly
you're
not
going
to
urge--
unknown
speaker
--congress
can
lift
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
unknown
speaker
there's...
there's
a
distinction
between
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
rest
of
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
authorized
states.
unknown
speaker
authorized
states.
unknown
speaker
so
in
saying
that,
what
you're
doing...
is
what
you're
doing
taking
the
word
dependent
in
domestic
dependent
nation
and
saying
that
congress
has
a
degree
of
leeway
to
define
what
is
and
what
is
not
encompassed
by
the
word
dependent
so
that
if
congress
wants
to,
it
can
say
that
whereas
previously
an
exercise
of
pre-1650,
your
indian
jurisdiction,
because
they
could
have,
you
know...
which
was
removed
by
the
word
dependent
is
not
removed--
unknown
speaker
--because
congress...
congress
can
redefine
the
term
dependent?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
when
you
look
at
duro,
it...
it
said
that
what
it
found
the
exercise
of
criminal
jurisdiction
inconsistent
with
was
the
notion
of
dependency
in
the
phrase,
domestic
dependent
nation.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
therefore...
and...
and
there...
so
congress
has
the
authority
to
say
no,
at
least
as
to
future,
it
is
not
inconsistent.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
and...
and
since
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
prior
indian
tribal
power
but
simply
with
arrangements
that
congress
chooses
to
adopt,
it
necessarily
follows
that
congress
could
provide
that
anyone
in
this
room,
whether
an
indian...
whether
an
enrolled
indian
or
not,
could
be
subjected
to
trial
by
a...
a
tribal
court
and
then
subjected
to
a
second
trial,
despite
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
by
a
court
of
the
united
states.
right?
congress
could
provide
that.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
find
it
hard
to
think
that
that's
all
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
means.
unknown
speaker
but
derived
from
inherent
tribal
authority,
which
had
not
been
taken
away.
what's
different
here
is
that
it
had
been
taken
away
and
was
given
back,
and
it's
hard
to
decide...
it's
hard
to
consider
that
inherent
tribal
authority,
even
though
the...
the
statute
refers
to
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
that
provides
a
limitation.
that
provides
a
limitation
to...
you
know,
to
jurisdiction
over
the...
over
the
tribal
members,
and
that
was
a
very
important
limitation.
now
you're
saying
that
limitation
doesn't
exist.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
matter
what
has
been
allowed
to...
to
continue
down
to
the
present
day.
congress
can
change
all
of
that
and
permit
jurisdiction
over
non-tribal
members
and,
it
necessarily
follows,
permit
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
without
violating
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
congress
could
require
the
trial
of
non-indians
before
a...
an
indian
tribal
court?
unknown
speaker
this
is
maybe...
it's
very
interesting.
suppose...
i
would
think
on
your
approach
then
that
the
rights
that
the
individual
tribe
gets
is
a
function
of
the
due
process
clause.
and...
and
is
there
any
basis?
after
all,
indian
tribal
members
are
persons
within
the
united
states
to
whom
the
due
process
clause
is
applicable.
imagine
a
tribe
that
does
not
give
you
counsel
in
a
criminal
trial.
that
could
happen.
all
right?
now,
is
there
a
basis
under
the
due
process
clause
for
distinguishing
between
whether
the
defendant
in
such
a
case
is,
a,
a
member
of
that
tribe;
b,
a
non-tribe
member
but
an
indian;
c,
a
non-indian?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
isn't
going
to
help
in
terms
of
my
question
because
i'm
interested
in
congress'
power.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
maybe
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
maybe
the
answer
to
this
case
makes
no
difference
in
respect
to
that.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
a
question
in
respect
to
right
to
counsel,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
well,
except...
except
with
respect
to
the
indian
civil
rights
act,
you
can...
you
can...
and
i
think
this
solves
due
process
problems.
you...
you
can
assert
the
maxim
of
volenti
non
fit
injuria.
you...
you
are
not
subject
to...
to
this
kind
of
trial
unless
you
choose
to
be
an
enrolled
member
of
the
tribe.
you
can
withdraw
from
that
at
any
time.
unknown
speaker
but
to
now
extend
the
government's
power
to
subject
people
to
this
kind
of
trial
beyond
members
of
the...
of
the
tribe
that...
that
has
the
tribal
court
to
members
of
other
tribes
and,
as
you
necessarily
acknowledge,
even
to
non-indians,
that's
a...
that's
a
step
i'm...
i'm
not
prepared
to
contemplate.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
it--
unknown
speaker
--would
it
be
a
defense,
say,
to
someone
charged
with
a
crime
in
wisconsin
to
say
volenti
non
fit...
you
move
to
minnesota.
they
don't
treat
you--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
kneedler,
just
to
bring
it
back
to
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
due
process
or
equal
protection
challenge
by
mr.
lara.
he's
contesting
the
second
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
because
if
it's
not
valid,
then
he's
being
prosecuted
for
the
first
time.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
all
these
questions
are
very
relevant
to
whether
we
should
accept
your...
or...
or
the
government's
assertion
of
what
congress
can
do.
those...
if...
if
your...
your
proposal
raises
all
of
these
serious
constitutional
questions,
we're
less
inclined,
it
seems
to
me,
to
adopt
that
proposal.
unknown
speaker
but...
but...
so...
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
the
court
has
very
substantial
concerns
over
the
government's
proposition
that
within
the
territorial
united
states
a
non-constitutional
entity
can
be
allowed
to
try
a
united
states
citizen,
if
we
have
concerns
about
that,
you're
giving
us
no
ability
to
draw
a
line
so
that
you
can
prevail
in
this
case.
you
are...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
conceding,
by
your
last
statement,
that
if
we
rule
in
favor
of
your
position,
it
must
necessarily
apply
to
non-indians.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
an
astounding
proposition.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
was
before
indians
were
citizens
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
one
wonders
if
you
go
beyond
members
of
the
tribe
itself
to
outsiders,
whether
that
distinction
between
citizens
of
the
united
states
is
valid.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was...
that
was
not
in
the
context
of
regulating
non-indians.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
are
also
not
dependent
sovereigns.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
there's
an
entirely
different
conceptualization
involved.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
reichert,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
if
we
take
your
approach
then
in
trying
to
carry
out
what
was
the
will
of
congress,
i
think
we'd
have
to
say
that
the
first
prosecution
doesn't
count
because
the
one
thing
is...
seems
to
me
pretty
clear
from
this
record,
that
congress
did
not
want
to
have
a
situation
where
there
was
a
delegation
of
federal
authority.
the
whole
idea
was
that
you
would
have
the
federal...
the
possibility
of
the
federal
prosecution
and
the
tribal
prosecution.
i...
i
think
that
it's...
it's
inescapably
clear
that
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
do,
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
a
u.s.
attorney
prosecution.
so
if
you're
right,
then
i
think
making
the...
the
bottom
line
what
would
congress
do
if
it
couldn't
accomplish
what
it
set
out
to
accomplish,
one
would
say,
well,
all
bets
are
off
and
not
adopt
your
position
that
congress
chose
to
delegate
federal
authority
when
it
seems
to
me
pretty
clear
that
it
didn't.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
do
that.
you
can't...
you
can't
achieve
the
end
by
a
means
other
than
the
means
which
congress
provided
to
that
end.
it
did,
indeed,
intend
to
close
a
gap,
but
the
means
which
it
selected
to
close
that
gap
was
the
reconferral...
the
attempted
reconferral
of
inherent
sovereignty
upon
the
indian
tribes.
there's
no
delegation
language
in
that.
they
clearly
chose
the
means
to
the
end
of...
of
covering
the
gap,
the
means
of
reconferring
sovereignty.
and
if
that
is
invalid,
then
the
statute
is
invalid.
we...
we
have
no
power
to
transmogrify
it
into
a...
a
delegation
when
it
clearly
is
not
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you...
do
you
have
authority
for
the
proposition
that
if
you're
tried
by
a
court
without
jurisdiction,
it's
nevertheless
sufficient
to
invoke
double
jeopardy,
if
we
have
to
reach
that
here?
do
you
have
authority
for
that
or
is
that
a
novel
proposition?
unknown
speaker
what
if...
what
if
he'd
been
prosecuted
in
france
and
served
90
days
there
and
then
he
was
tried
here?
would
that
be
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
well,
and...
and
furthermore,
you
have
a
habeas
remedy
after
the
first...
after
the
first
trial
to...
to
object
to
the
sentence.
getting
back
to
the...
to
the
point,
why
is
it...
let's
assume
for
the
moment...
it's
just
an
assumption...
that
the...
that
the
tribes
had
as
a
historical
matter
the
sovereign
authority
to
try
non-member
indians
and
that
congress
took
that
away.
could
congress
then
give
it
back?
unknown
speaker
why...
why
would
it
be
a
delegation?
why
couldn't
they
say
we...
we
define
the
scope
of
indian
sovereignty
and
we...
we
ratchet
it
up
and
we
ratchet
it
down?
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
interrupt
you
on
that?
supposing
they
had
a...
a
procedure
for
electing
their
chiefs
and
congress
said
that's
unfair
to
women
or
something,
so
you
can't
do
it
anymore,
and
then
10
years
later
just
repealed
the
statute.
would
they
then
have
delegated
the
power
to
elect
the
chiefs
the
way
they
did
it
for
100
years?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reichert--
--they
could
do
it
with
puerto
rico,
couldn't
they?
sorry.
with
puerto
rico,
can't
congress,
for
example,
define
the
sovereign
relation
between
the
united
states
and
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
i
would
have
thought
it
had
considerable
power
there.
and
if
it
can
do
it
there,
why
can't
it
do
it
here?
i
mean,
you
could
enter
into
a
treaty
changing
the
nature
of
the
sovereign
power
and
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
have
basically
taken
to
themselves
through
statute
the
treaty-making
authority.
and
so
what's...
why
is
this
any
different
from...
from
redefining
the
nature
of
the
sovereign
relationship
between,
say,
guam,
puerto
rico,
a
whole...
you
know,
those
entities
that
are
not
states?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
does.
suppose
it
says
the
commonwealth,
which
is
a
totally
uncertain
concept,
henceforth
means
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e.
all
right?
now...
now,
whether
that's
wise
or
not
wise
i
have
no
idea,
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
constitution
that
would
stop
congress
from
doing
that.
and
if
there
is
nothing
there,
why
is
there
here
where,
in
fact...
i
don't
want
to
repeat
myself.
but
my
understanding
of
this
is
that
over
the
years
congress
has,
through
legislation...
or
congress
has
changed
the
making
of
the
treaty
to
define
the
relationship
into
a
situation
where
we
define
the
relationship
with
the
indian
tribes
through
legislation.
what
about
philippines?
at
least
i
don't
see
why
they--
--i
assume
we
did
precisely
that
with
the
philippines,
and
i...
i
guess
justice
breyer
is
suggesting
that
we
can
simply
revoke
philippine
independence,
which
we...
which
we
graciously
gave
them,
and
now,
since
it
was
all
done
through
the
treaty
power,
we
can
just
revoke
it.
but
this
is
the
opposite.
i
suppose
we
could--
unknown
speaker
--can
i
just...
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
critical
part
of
the
case
where
the...
supposing
the
tribe
had
a...
a
criminal
statute
and
saying
you
cannot
cut
trees
above
5,000
feet
on
the
mountains
because
that's
sacred
land
or
something
like
that.
and
congress
decided
they
wanted
to
build
a
road
up
there,
so
they
preempted
the...
the
indian
statute
and
said
we
cannot
enforce
that
statute.
then
after
they
built
the
road,
they
decided,
well,
they'd
let
them
go
back
to
the
way
they
did,
and
they
said
we
repeal
the
preempting
statute.
now,
would
that
be
a
delegation
of
power
to...
to
protect
those
religious
grounds,
or
would
that
be
just
a
restoration
of
a
preexisting
sovereign
power?
unknown
speaker
where...
where
do
you
get
the
authority
for
that
one-way
ratcheting
when
we've
said
that
congress
has
plenary
power
over
the
tribes?
what
opinion
of
this
court
do
you
look
to
for
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
okay.
mr.
reichert,
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
because
i...
i
think...
i
think
there
are
two
different
arguments
in
play
in...
in
what's
going
on
here,
and
i
thought
you
had
started
out
with
one
and
now
you
seem
to
be
going
to
a
different
one.
one
argument
is
congress
didn't
take
away
this
power
over...
the
tribal
power
to...
to
prosecute
non-tribal
members.
there's
no
act
of
congress
that
said
they
can't
do
that.
the
reason
they
can't
do
that
is
there's
a
sovereignty
relationship.
there's
no
act
of
congress
that
articulated
that
sovereignty
relationship.
it's
just
the
way
we
understand
things.
the
tribes
are
dependent
sovereigns.
and
on
that
theory...
that's
where
i...
i
thought
you
were
coming
from
originally,
and...
and
on
that
theory,
congress
can't
restore
it
because
it
can't
change
that
relationship,
or
at
least
it
hasn't
changed
that
relationship
of...
of
dependent
sovereignty.
a
second
way
that...
that
is
being
explored
here
is...
is
on
the
assumption
that
congress
by
some
act
took
away
the
sovereignty
to
prosecute
non-tribal
members
and
now
wants
to
give
it
back.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
should
be
in
the
second
case,
but
i
thought
your
argument
depended
on
the
first
case
or
the
first
example.
is...
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it's...
it's
the
sovereign
relationship
rather
than
an
act
of
congress
that
takes
away
that
is
crucial
for
understanding
the
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
we
said
that
in
oliphant,
among
other
things.
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
so
it's
a
power
always
to
take
away,
but
never
to
give
back
that's--
unknown
speaker
--but
do
we...
i'm
sorry.
can
i
interrupt--
--do
we...
we
have
to
get--
--what
transformed
the
tribes
from
independent
sovereigns
to
dependent
sovereigns
was
not
a
decision
of
this
court
and
the
act
of
congress.
it
was
the
acts
of
the
legislature
and
they
took
over
a
lot
of
things
that
were
previously
independent
sovereignty
of
the
tribes.
and
if
you
go
back
a
couple
hundred
years,
they
clearly
had
their
own
inherent
power
to
try
non-members.
maybe
they
lost
it
in
the
change
in
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
tribe,
but
that's
not
as
a
result
of
an
act
of
congress
or
a
decision
of
this
court.
it's
the
result
of
historical
events.
unknown
speaker
essentially
the
trouble
i
have
with
your
case
is
that
it
depends
on
making
a
distinction
between
the
status
of...
of
indian
sovereignty
which
hasn't
yet
been
taken
away
but
which
exists
totally
the
whim
of
congress.
and
that,
you
say,
is
not...
is...
that
does
not
allow
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
be
invoked
because...
i
don't
know
what.
you
call
that
sovereignty,
that
dependent
sovereignty?
but
you
say,
however,
if
congress
acts
to
take
it
away,
then
it
can't
give
it
back.
it
seems
to
me
in
both
cases
whatever
power
the
indian
tribe
has
is
power
that
exists
at
the
pleasure
of
the
united
states,
and
i
don't
know
why
in...
the
one
case
is
any
better
than
the
other
as
far
as
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
concerned.
whatever
power
they
exercise,
they
exercise
because
we
let
them
exercise
it.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
shouldn't
the...
i
mean,
i...
i...
if
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
apply
in
one
situation,
it
seems
to
me
it
shouldn't
apply
in
the
other.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
doesn't
gideon
v.
wainwright
and
all
the
other
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
apply?
unknown
speaker
to...
to
any
indian
tribal
prosecution
of
its
own...
even
of
its
own
members.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
the
answer
then
to
the
due
process
problem,
which
you've
just
given,
is
that
the...
the
member...
the
tribal
member,
the
non-tribal
indian,
and
the
non-indian
are
all
persons
subject
to
the
due
process
clause,
but
what
counts
is
due
process
may
vary
between
whether
you
are
a
tribal
member
or
not
because
of
the
argument
you
just
gave.
now,
if
that's
so,
that
solves
that
problem.
then
we're
back
to
the
question
of
why
not
allow
congress
to
define
sovereignty.
i
thought
justice
scalia's
point
was
a
very
good
point
to
mention
the
philippines.
if
you
reverse
it,
don't
we
have
the
authority
in
the
united
states
to
give
the
philippines
independence?
and
if
in
fact,
we
get
into
the
habit
of
making
that
kind
of
decision
through
a
congressional
law,
why
could
we
not
do
the
same
to
the
indian
tribes?
and
if
there
is
a
boundary
there,
it
must
have
to
do
with
the
nature
of
a
constitution
of
the
united
states,
not
some
language.
and
i
can't
find
anything
here
that
would
suggest
that
in
doing
this,
that
boundary
is
passed.
so
what's...
what's
the
answer
to
that
kind
of
argument?
unknown
speaker
to
the
contrary.
i'm
saying
naturally
congress
has
the
power
to
take,
let's
say,
something
that
is
not
a
state...
it
is
like
puerto
rico
or
the
philippines...
and
to
say
we
are
changing
the
status
of
that
entity.
now,
i
would
think
you'd
start
from
the
proposition
that
they
do
have
the
power
to
define
the
relationship
of
entities
that
are
not
states
to
the
united
states.
now,
if
there
is
a
limit
on
that,
it
must
be
found
either
explicitly,
which
i
can't
find,
or
implicitly
in
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
document
itself.
so
i
am
looking
to
you
to
tell
me
any
kind
of
limit
like
that
which
might
prevent
what
congress
tried
to
do
here.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
turn
the
question
then.
which
is
the
power
that
allowed
us
to
give
independence
to
the
philippines?
which
is
the
power
that
allowed
us
to
pass
the
federal
relations
act
or
the
commonwealth
relations
act
that
defines
the
relationship
with
puerto
rico?
which
is
the
power...
where...
where
are
these
powers
in
the...
i'm
not
saying
they're
not
there.
i'm
saying
that
i'm
not
an
expert
in
this
area
and
i...
i'd
like
you
to
make
this
argument
of
where
they
are.
unknown
speaker
now,
my
impression
is
that
we
used
to
do
this
through
treaty,
but
at
some
point
the
house
of
representatives
was
somewhat
unhappy
about
not
having
a
role
in
this
and
therefore
it
became
changed
such
that
the
relationship
with
the
indian
tribes
is
defined
through
agreement
ratified
and
enacted
into
law
by
both
houses
of
congress.
now,
was
that
unconstitutional
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
suppose
that
if
this
court
said
that
the
nature
of
sovereignty
is
such
that
it
has
certain
limits
and
that
this
is
imposed
because
of
the
constitution
and
because
of
long
use,
perhaps
congress
couldn't
change
it.
but
we
haven't
said
that.
unknown
speaker
we
have
not
said
that.
duro
didn't
say
that.
duro
said
we'll
look
at
the
statute.
congress
didn't
give
this
power.
end
of
case.
that's
all.
insofar
as
the
territories,
because
that's
under
article
iv
of
the
constitution,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that
may
well
be
a
different
case
because
then
we're
concerned
with
the
powers
of...
of
indian
tribes
as
a
historical
matter
of
their
sovereignty
over
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
have
direct
relations,
responsibilities,
obligations,
and
rights
both
with
their
states
and
with
the
national
government,
and
under
the
insular
cases,
the
constitution
applies
with
full
force
to
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
so
that's
a
very
different...
that's
a
very
different
case.
unknown
speaker
then
you're
making
a...
then
you're
making
a
constitutional
argument
and
it's
an
appropriate
argument.
but
i...
i
don't
think
it
follows
from
that
that
within
the
realm
where
congress
does
have
authority,
i.e.,
the
relations
of
indian
tribes
with
their
own
members,
that
it
can't
give
in
one
year
and
take
away
the...
the
other
year.
i...
i
just
don't
think
you
need
that
argument
to
prevail
in
your
case.
unknown
speaker
what
about
someone
who
lives
on
the
reservation,
marries
a
woman
who
is
a
member
of
the
tribe?
why
doesn't
the
tribe
have
at
least
the
sovereign
authority...
it's
always
at
the
sufferance
of
congress,
but
to
say
when
things
go
wrong
on
our
reservation,
when
our
people
are
hurt,
we
are
entitled
to
prosecute
the
wrongdoer?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
brendale
with
a
zoning
ordinance
and
so
forth?
is
criminal
jurisdiction
different?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
what's...
what's
the
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but
then
you've
given
the
answer
to
your
own
question.
if
you're
right...
if
you're
right
that
this
does...
is
absolutely,
you
know,
a
violation
of
due
process
to
subject
the
non-tribal
member,
say,
to
a
trial
without
a
lawyer,
well,
then
you
would
win,
but
not
this
case.
what
you
would
win
is
a
case
where
there
was
an
appeal
from
the
tribal
prosecution,
and
under
those
circumstances,
they
had
raised
the
question
just
as
you
phrased
it,
say
it
may
not
violate
due
process,
for
the
reasons
you
gave,
not
to
give
the
tribal
member
a
lawyer,
but
it
does
violate
due
process
for
congress
to
pass
a
law
which
subjects
me
to
this
criminal
trial
without
a
lawyer
because
i
am
not
a
tribal
member.
so
if
you
are
right,
there
is
a
vehicle
to
make
that
claim
and
you
will
win
or
your
client
will.
but
he
didn't
take
advantage
of
that
vehicle
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
do
it
all
the
time.
we
have
a
lot
of
pro
se
applicants
that
make
very
complex
arguments.
that's
not
new.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
he'd
be
subjected
to
the
same
thing
on
his
own
reservation,
on
the
reservation
of
his
own
tribe,
and
you
say
that's
okay.
unknown
speaker
mightn't
there
be
such
a
thing
as,
you
know,
when...
when
you
enroll
in
any
tribe,
you
subject
yourself
to
what
might
be
call
indian
law--
unknown
speaker
--the
law
of
your
tribal
council
and
the
law
of...
of
other
tribal
councils?
and
just
as
you're
not
entitled
to
an
attorney
before
your
own
tribal
council,
you're
not
entitled
to
an
attorney
before
another
one.
why...
that...
that
would
be
a
sensible
resolution
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
differ
from
somebody
from
virginia
who
caused
some
trouble
in
louisiana
and
doesn't
want
to
go
to
the
louisiana
courts
because
they
have
this
mixed
civil/common
law
system?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is--
--yes,
but
if...
if--
--this
is
so
hypothetical
because
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
he
asked
for
a
lawyer,
was
denied
a
lawyer.
we
have
to
assume
that...
that's...
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
you're...
you're
not
forced
to
have
a
lawyer.
but
even
beyond
that,
if
you
convince
us
that
the
other...
the
other
conviction
is
void,
what's
the
basis
for
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there's
no
valid
judgment
if
you're
right.
unknown
speaker
no.
they're
relying
on
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine.
and
you...
you
don't
seem
to
me
to
challenge
that
either,
do
you?
you're
not
asking
us
to
reexamine
the
basic
double
jeopardy
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
just
one
question?
of
what
tribe
is
lara
a
member?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
will
be
in
the
record.
do
you
know
if
there
is
a...
any
kind
of
an
agreement
between
his
tribe
and
the
prosecuting
tribe?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
reichert.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
tribal
membership
is
always
consensual
in
the
context
that
we're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
a
defendant
in
the
case
right
before
the
trial
starts
could
disavow
his
indian
status?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
that...
why
that
would
follow?
if
he
had
that
absolute
right,
it
seems
to
me
anytime
before
judgment
he
should...
he
could
say
i'm
stopped
being
an
indian.
unknown
speaker
could
the
congress
define
a...
a
criminal
offense
between
one
indian
as
another
indian
and
require
that
the
trial
be
in
a
tribal
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
because
my
next
question
would
be
if
they
did,
could
there
then
be
double
jeopardy
if
there
was
a
second
trial.
