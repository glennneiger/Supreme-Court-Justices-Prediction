justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
on
the
surface,
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
billy
jo
lara,
who
is
a
member
of
the
chippewa
indian
tribe,
claims
that
the
current
federal
prosecution,
he
has
been
prosecuted
federally
for
assaulting
an
officer,
and
he
says
that
that
prosecution
is
the
second
time
that
he
has
been
prosecuted
for
the
same
thing,
and
the
first
time
was
when
an
indian
tribe
that
he
is
not
a
member
of,
the
spirit
lake
tribe,
convicted
him
of
the
same
assault.
now,
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
everybody
admits,
allows
two
prosecutions
for
the
same
crime
as
long
as
each
prosecution
is
brought
by
a
different
sovereign.
now,
this
is
called
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine,
and
it
brings
us
to
what
is
really
the
deeper
more
difficult
issue
in
the
case,
and
that
concerns
what
the
nature
of
that
first
prosecution
by
the
indian
tribe
was.
does
that
prosecution
represent
an
exercise
of
power
by
the
same
federal
government
that
is
now
trying
to
prosecute
lara
again?
or
is
that
first
tribal
prosecution
an
exercise
of
power
by
a
separate
sovereign?
well,
we
have
two
prior
cases
that
deal
with
a
similar
kind
of
issue.
in
united
states
versus
wheeler,
we
said
when
an
indian
tribe
prosecutes
a
member
of
the
same
tribe
it
is
not
acting
as
part
of
the
united
states;
it
is
acting
as
a
separate
sovereign,
because
a
tribe
retains
the
inherent
tribal
sovereignty
to
prosecute
its
own
members.
but
then
in
a
case
called
duro
versus
reina,
we
said
that
when
that
tribe
prosecutes
a
member
of
a
different
tribe,
it
does
not
have
inherent
tribal
authority
to
do
so.
so,
after
duro,
the
understanding
was
that
a
tribal
prosecution
of
a
non-member
could
only
take
place
if
the
federal
government
delegated
federal
power
to
the
tribe
to
conduct
the
prosecution.
but
why
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter?
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter
because
congress
then
enacted
a
statute,
and
that
statute
gave
each
tribe
the
power
to
prosecute
members
of
other
tribes
for
certain
offenses,
and
that
statute
adds
that
when
congress
gives
them
that
power,
it
is
recognizing
and
affirming
the
tribe’s
inherent
power,
i.e.
their
own
sovereign
tribal
power
to
conduct
that
prosecution,
and
that
is
what
the
sprit
lake
tribe
did.
so,
we
have
to
ask
whether
congress
has
the
constitutional
power
to
do
what
it
tried
to
do
to
relax
restrictions
that
over
the
course
of
time
political
branches
have
placed
on
what
was
many,
many,
many
years
ago
an
exercise
of
the
tribe’s
inherent
power
to
prosecute
members
of
other
tribes.
we
conclude
that
congress
does
possess
the
constitutional
authority
in
effect,
to
give
back
that
tribal
authority
to
the
indian
tribes.
first,
the
constitution
grants
congress
powers
that
this
court
has
described
as
plannery
and
exclusive
in
respect
to
indian
tribes
and
we
have
found,
this
court
has,
that
authority
rooted
in
the
indian
commerce
clause
and
also
in
parts
of
the
constitution
that
grant
congress
certain
authority
in
foreign
affairs
and
military
matter.
second,
we
found
other
instances
in
which
congress
has
changed
the
meets
and
bounds
of
tribal
sovereign
authority
as
well
as
tribal
status.
third,
this
kind
of
a
goal
changing,
modifying
status
is
not
an
unusual
kind
of
goal,
for
congress
has
done
that
kind
of
thing
in
other
areas
under
other
parts
of
the
constitution,
think
for
example
of
the
philippines
or
puerto
rico.
fourth,
the
change
made
here
is
limited.
fifth,
we
do
not
read
our
prior
cases
as
stopping
congress
from
doing
it.
and
finally,
we
reserve
for
other
future
cases
if
they
come.
the
question
of
whether
prosecuting
a
non-member
indian
violates,
for
example,
guarantees
of
the
due
process
clause
or
the
equal
protection
clause,
those
issues
are
not
relevant
in
this
particular
dual
sovereignty
context.
we
conclude
the
tribe
was
acting
as
a
separate
sovereign
when
it
prosecuted
lara.
consequently,
the
first
tribal
prosecution
cannot
bar
a
second
federal
prosecution
and
we
reverse
an
eighth
circuit
decision
holding
to
the
contrary.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
kennedy
has
