mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
the
central
legal
issue
in
this
case,
the
critical
fact
is
that,
at
the
jailhouse,
after
petitioner
was
transported
from
his
home,
petitioner
received
a
full
set
of
miranda
warnings,
which
apprised
him
of
his
right
to
counsel,
and
knowingly,
voluntarily,
and
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
i
believe
that
the
eighth
circuit
did,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
eighth
circuit
applied
oregon
v.
elstad
to
reject
what
appears
to
be
a
miranda-style
argument
that
petitioner
made
in
addition
to
his
sixth
amendment
argument.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
i
think
in...
in
part,
justice
o'connor,
your
reading
of
the
opinion
is
correct.
the
court
did
say
that
under
patterson,
the
sixth
amendment
argument
that
petitioner
is
making
in
this
court
doesn't
get
out
of
the
starting
gate,
because
there
was
no
interrogation,
it
used
the
word
interrogation.
there
was
an
issue
about
whether
interrogation
is
equivalent
to
deliberate
elicitation,
and
i'll
try
to
address
that.
but
before
the
court
got
to
the
sixth
amendment
question,
it
addressed
on
pages
121
and
122
of
the
joint
appendix
the
argument
based
on
elstad,
and
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
made
was
that
the
statements
made
at
the
jailhouse
should
be
suppressed...
and
this
is
on
page
121
of
the
joint
appendix...
because
the
primary
taint
of
the
improperly
elicited
statements
made
at
his
home
was
not
removed
by
the
recitation
of
his
miranda
rights
at
the
jail.
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
discuss
oregon
v.
elstad
in
detail
and
rejected
that
holding,
that
argument.
and
the
way
that
i
interpret
that
passage
is
that
the
court
affirmed
the
district
court's
explicit
finding
of
a
knowing,
voluntary,
and
intelligent
waiver,
and
applied
elstad
to
reject
that
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
patterson
v.
illinois
specifically
addressed
the
question
of
what
does
it
take
for
officers
to
obtain
a
waiver
of
counsel.
the
only
point
where
i
would
disagree,
justice
kennedy,
with
your
summary
is
that
presence
of
counsel
is
not
required.
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
choose
whether
to
have
or
to
waive
counsel.
and
in
patterson,
the
court
held
that
the
miranda
warnings
conveyed
to
a
suspect
who
has
been
indicted
all
of
the
information
needed
to
make
a
knowing
and
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel
in
custodial
interrogation.
that's
what
petitioner
got.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
they
can
approach
the
defendant,
apprise
him
of
his
rights,
and
if
the
defendant
then
makes
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
his
rights--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
so,
if
that's
construed
as
seeking
a
waiver
of
his
right
to
counsel.
of
course,
there
has
to
be
a
finding
that
there
was
in
fact
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel.
the
police
officers
can't
simply
read
miranda
warnings,
provide
no
interruption
whatsoever
to
make
sure
that
the
defendant
actually
understood
them,
and
then
barge
right
ahead.
now,
there
are
cases
where
the
courts
have
to
decide
whether
there
was
an
implicit
waiver
of.1
counsel
under
those
circumstances,
but
this
isn't
a
case
like
that,
because
the
miranda
waiver
form
in
the
record
clearly
indicates--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
stevens.
our--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that...
that
is
true.
i...
my
submission
is
on
the
critical
legal
question.
even
if
the
court
finds
against
us
on
what
i
would
acknowledge
is
a
close
question
about
whether
the
interaction
at
the
home
constituted
deliberate
elicitation
under
the
sixth
amendment--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
was
a...
an
actual
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
at
the
time.
the
sixth
amendment
is
a
trial
right.
the
right
to
counsel
has
to
be
evaluated
by
reference--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
at
that
time.
i...
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
justice
stevens--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
it
is
extreme,
because
i'm
going
to
follow
it
up
with
what
i
think
your
honor
is
getting
to,
which
is,
can
the
police
simply
go
to
an
indicted
suspect's
home,
ignore
his
right
to
counsel,
and
engage
in
questioning?
and
the
answer
is,
generally
no,
sometimes
yes.
the
generally
no
is
that
once
the
defendant
has
been
indicted,
the
right
to
counsel
provides
a...
or
a
direction
to
the
police
not
to
interfere
with
or
circumvent
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
sometimes
yes
is
that,
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
seminal
case
in
this
area,
the
massiah
case,
and
then
again
in
maine
v.
moulton,
that
the
sixth
amendment,
as
it
is
offense-specific,
does
not
preclude
the
police
from
investigating
ongoing
criminal
activity
that's
not
charged.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
i...
and
this
case
doesn't
involve
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
may
be
a
ethical
obligation,
even
if
the
party
is
not
known
to
be
represented
at
the
time,
although--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he's
known
not
be
represented,
i
think
it's
a
closer
question
whether...
whether
the
ethics
rules
would...
would
bar
the
approaching
of
the
defendant.
but
this
court
has
made--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
stevens--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
justice
stevens--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
implication
is
that
you
couldn't
approach
him.
and
this
court
has
clearly
made
it
evident
that
whatever
the
ethical
rules
might
be
with
respect
to
private
conduct,
the
sixth
amendment
rules
are
not
governed
by
them.
and
the
sixth
amendment
rule,
in
this
area
at
least,
is
relatively
clear.
the
police
can
approach
an
unrepresented
defendant,
advise
him
of
his
rights,
and
obtain
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
on
the
charged
offense,
justice
o'connor,
and
have
the
information
admitted
at
trial.
the...
the
threshold
question--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that...
that
has
been
the
way
that
this
court
has
formulated
the
test,
and
i
would
suggest
that
if--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
but
i
think
the
court
should
clearly
reformulate
it
to
make
it
in
the
context
of
overt
interrogation
by
the
police,
known
police
officers,
to
be
an
objective
test.
the
deliberate
elicitation
standard,
as
so
phrased,
gives
rise
to
some
confusion,
because
it
does
suggest
that
there's
a
subjective
component
to
it,
where
deliberate
elicitation
does
have
a
different
application
than
interrogation
for
purposes
of
miranda
with
respect
to
undercover
agents.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
once
a
suspect
is
indicted,
the
police
cannot
use
an
undercover
agent,
not
known
or
identified
as
such
to
the
defendant,
to
circumvent
his
right
to
counsel.
and
in
that
respect,
deliberate
elicitation
is
broader.
but
in
footnote
12
of
maine
v.
moulton
where
the
court
was
discussing
deliberate
elicitation
in
some
detail,
the
court
made
clear
that
intent
is
hard
to
prove,
and
it's
really
not
the
main
issue
here
anyway.
what
we
should
be
interested
in
is
whether
the
government
must
have
known
that
its
conduct
would
be
likely
to
elicit
incriminating
statements,
and
that
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
rhode
island
v.
innis
standard
for
interrogation.
in
fact,
it's
a
little
bit
more
onerous
for
the
defendant,
because
it
says,
must
have
known,
and
the
rhode
island
v.
innis
standard
is
should
have
known.
in
any
event,
the
government
submits
that
the
court
should
make
it
clearer
that
when
you're
dealing
with
identified
police
officers
interacting
with
suspects
post-indictment,
the
rhode
island
v.
innis
standard,
the
objective
test
should
be
the
definition
of
deliberate
elicitation.
then
the
question
becomes,
was
there
deliberate
elicitation
on
the
record
in
this
case?
what
happened
is,
the
officers
arrived
at
petitioner's
home.
the
officers
knew
petitioner.
this
was
not
somebody
that
they
had
never
met
before.
they'd
met
him
on
prior
occasions.
and
they
said
in
one
continuous
statement,
we're
here
to
discuss
your
methamphetamine
activities,
we
have
a
warrant
for
your
arrest--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
souter,
on
three
occasions
when
officer
bliemeister
was
asked
to
say
what
he
said
in
his
own
words,
he
said,
we're
here
to
discuss
your
methamphetamine
activities.
on
one
occasion,
when
defense
counsel
in
cross-examination
reformulated
what
officer
bliemeister
said,
and
said,
didn't
you
say
you're
here
to
discuss
with
petitioner
his
methamphetamine
activities,
officer
bliemeister
answered
yes.
both
the
magistrate
judge
and
the
district
court
did
not
use
the
with
you
language
in
describing
what
the
officer
said.
and
to
the
extent
that
this
case
turns
on
a
rather
subtle
distinction
in
language,
i
think
the
distinction
is
relevant,
because
what
the
officers
were
essentially
doing
is
introducing
the
topic
of
what
they
were
going
to
tell
petitioner,
namely,
your
methamphetamine
activities
have
landed
you
in
trouble,
we're
here
to
arrest
you,
we
have
an
indictment
for
your
arrest.
and
then
petitioner
began
to
speak
primarily--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
there
was
any
ambiguity
about
the
object
of
the
statements,
but
the
question
of
what
the
officers
were
intending
to
do
is
somewhat
informed
by
the
way
they
phrased
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
readily
acknowledge
that
this
is
a
case
that
could
be
reasonably
decided
more
than
one
way,
but
i
would
submit
that
if
you
look
at
what
the
officers
did,
the
officers
in
the...
at
his
home,
basically
informed
him
about
the
fact
that
he
was
under
arrest
and
indicted.
he
spoke
uninterrupted
except
by
one
completely
irrelevant
question
to
the
topic
of
the
indictment,
until
the
officers
interrupted
him,
cut
him
off,
and
said
it's
time
to
go,
john,
you
know.
and
john
said,
can
i
please
get
some
shoes
on?
and
they
accompanied
him
downstairs,
he
got
shoes,
then
they
took
him
down
to
the
jailhouse.
no
questions
about
the
topics
that
were
later
discussed
at
the
jailhouse.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
then
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
this
court
should
apply
its
rule
in
oregon
v.
elstad
that
the
knowing,
voluntary,
and
intelligent
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
constitutes
an
independent
act
of
free
will
that
breaks
any
causal
link
that
might
otherwise
have
been
posited
between
the
statements
that
were
made
in
the
initial
unwarned
session--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
only
do
i
think
that
it
was
made
explicitly
in
the
district
court
and
implicitly
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
don't
believe
that
petitioner
contests
it.
i
don't
believe
that
petitioner's
position
is
that
the
waiver
of
rights
was
actually
tainted.
what
i
understand
petitioner's
position
to
be
is
that
there
was
a
violation
of
a
primary
constitutional
norm
at
home
when...
when
petitioner
was
interrogated
or
statements
were
deliberately
elicited.
accordingly--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--exactly.
the
same
fruits
rule
ought
to
apply
that
applies
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
then
petitioner
relies
on
fourth
amendment
precedents,
which
the
government
does
not
think
are...
are
applicable
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
scalia,
i'll
have
to
let
petitioner's
briefs
speak
for
what--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
are
two
critical
reasons,
justice
breyer,
why
oregon
v.
elstad
should
apply
in
this
context.
the
first
is
that
the
right
that
the
defendant
did
not
get,
by
hypothesis
now,
at
home,
was
the
right
to
make
an
informed
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel.
when
the
defendant
got
the
miranda
warnings
at
home,
that
fully
cured
any
deficiency
in
knowledge
that
the
defendant
previously
had
about
his
right
to
counsel,
and
enabled
him
to
make
an
act
of
free
will
that
broke
any
causal
link
between
the
first
statements
and
the
second
statements.
and
the
second
crucial
reason
why
elstad
should
apply
here
is
elstad
is
not
simply
limited
to
reasoning
that
is
only
applicable
in
the
context
of
compulsion
under
the
fifth
amendment.
it
also
clearly
and
explicitly
said,
it's
very
speculative
and
attenuated
to
posit
that
a
defendant
who
spoke
at
one
time
is
therefore
going
to
believe
that
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
and
i
should
speak
again,
i
don't
really
have
a
choice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
change,
justice
breyer,
because
the
court
has
never
addressed
the
specific
dynamic
involved
in
this
case
under
the
sixth
amendment
of
a
defendant
who
makes
an
unwarned
statement--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
does--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
and
i...
i
accept,
although
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
nix
did
no
more
than
assume
that
there
would
be
a
fruits
rule
as
to
physical
evidence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
as
to
physical
evidence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
court...
the
court
there
relied
on
inevitable
discovery.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
here,
our
basic
position
is
that
the
voluntary
testimony
of
the
defendant
himself
is
different
from
physical
fruits
or
from
the
situation
involving
a
tainted
line-up,
which
was
involved
in
wade,
and
that
the
decision,
made
voluntarily
and
intelligently
by
a
defendant
to
waive
counsel,
is
a
per
se
break
in
any
causal
chain
that
would
be
positive.
and
our
second
argument
is
that
the
court
has
already
rejected
in
elstad
the
idea
that
there
is
a
causal
link
between
a
defendant's
letting
a
cat
out
of
the
bag
in
the
first
statement
and
then
being
confronted
with
the
question
whether
to
waive
his
rights
in
the
second.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is.
my
view
that
the
violation
is
not
complete
until
the
evidence
is
introduced
at
trial,
but
i
think
where
i
put
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
numerically
accurate,
but
it's
somewhere
in
between
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment
rules,
in
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
i
believe
that
there
is
a
fruits
rule
attached
to
conduct
that
infringes
a
sixth
amendment
norm.
the
right
itself
may
not
be
a
completed
violation
until
evidence
that
results
from
infringing
a
sixth
amendment
norm
is
actually
used
against
the
defendant.
adversarial
fairness
is
the
goal
of
the
sixth
amendment.
if
it
is
not
infringed,
neither
is
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg.
and
one
example
that
i
think
makes
the
point
very
clear
is
this
court's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
cases.
those
cases
require
not
only
that
a
lawyer
performs
deficiently,
below
any
reasonable
professional
standard,
but
also
that
there
be
an
effect
on
the
fairness
of
the
trail
in
the
form
of
prejudice.
it's
a
two-part
standard.
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
merely
by
interfering
with
the
right
to
counsel.
another
case
that
makes
that
point--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
my--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i...
i
think
that
there's
a
lot
in
your
question,
justice
souter,
but
i...
i
think
i
basically
agree
with
the
thrust
of
it.
he
does
have
the
right
to
choose
whether
to
have
counsel
or
not
after
he's
been
indicted
when
the
police
approach
him
for
interrogation.
the
question
in
this
case
is,
what
do
you
do
if
that
didn't
happen?
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
as
we
discussed
yesterday,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i...
i
believe
that
the
violation
in
a
miranda
case
consists
precisely
of
the
admission
of
the
defendant's
statements
in
the
government
case
in
chief.
the
fifth
amendment
is
an
evidentiary
rule.
that's
what
the
nature
of
the
violation
is.
it's
not
a
conduct-based
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
matters
because
we're
conceding
that
the
court
engages
in
fruits
analysis.
our
primary
position
in
this
case
on
the
legal
issue
is
that
the
defendant's
independent,
untainted
decision
to
waive
counsel
is
a
act
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that...
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--true.
but
that's
what
the
court
held
over
your
honor's
dissent
in
patterson
v.
illinois.
the
court
explicitly
considered
the
issue
of
what
kind
of
a
waiver
is
necessary,
and
the
court
held
that
the
issuance
of
miranda
warnings
provides
the
defendant
with
all
the
information
that
he
needs
to
know.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
we're
not
claiming
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel.
our...
our
claim
for
whatever
favor
it
may
meet
with
the
court
is
that
there
was
no
deliberate
elicitation
of
statements.
we're
not
claiming
a
waiver
at
the
home.
we
are
unequivocally
claiming
a
waiver
at
the
jailhouse.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
it's
strange
at
all,
because
as
the
court
explained
in
patterson,
the
question
of
a
waiver
is
a
functional
question
that
turns
on
what
the
role
of
counsel
might
be
at
a
particular
setting.
now,
the
role
of
counsel
at
trial
is
considerably
more
complex
in
dealing
with
evidentiary
matters
and
legal
claims
than
the
role
in
pre-trial
interrogation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
in
this
particular
case,
and
this
is
my
third
and
final
point,
if
the
court
should
determine
that
the
waiver
of
rights
is
not
a
per
se
independent
act
that
attenuates
any
taint,
on
any
record
the
court
should
not
find
that
there
is
any
taint
that
is
unattenuated.
the
violation
at
home,
if
there
was
any,
was
an
extremely
mild
violation.
if
the
defendant
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag,
it
was
really
at
most
one
paw,
not
an
entire
cat.
[laughter]
the...
the
defendant
barely
spoke
at
all
about
his
activities
relating
to
the
charges
that
were
identified
in
the
indictment.
he
said
that
he
had
business
and
personal
problems
and
he
was
a
methamphetamine
user,
and
he
rambled
on
for
a
while
until
the
police
cut
him
off.
at
the
station
house,
he
was
asked
specifically
person
by
person
what
his
relationship
was
with
the
individual
and
what
the
activities
were,
and
of
course,
he
gave
more
elaborate
information
at
that
time,
but...
and
this
is
critical
too.
it
was
not
information
that
admitted
the
charges
in
the
indictment.
this
wasn't
a
case
where
a
defendant
said,
well,
i've
confessed
once,
i
might
as
well
confess
again
now
that
i
have
my
miranda
warning.
this
was
an
individual
who
spoke
about
his
problems
at
his
home,
then
he
gets
down
to
the
station
house
and
he's
essentially
talking
about
all
the
things
that
make
him
not
liable,
criminally
liable
under
the
indictment.
it
was
an
instance
in
which,
i
would
submit,
the
motive
for
the
defendant
to
talk
was
not
that
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag,
but
that
he
was
hoping
to
minimize
any
suggestion
of
guilt
and
persuade
the
officers
that
the
indictment
was
not
properly
founded.
and
finally,
of
course,
the
officers
never
exploited
any
prior
statement
and
they
did
give
him
a
thorough,
complete
administration
of
miranda
warnings,
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
even
if
the
court
were
to
apply
a
taint
analysis
sometimes,
or
to
assume
that
a
taint
analysis
applies,
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
enough
attenuation
so
that
the
jailhouse
statements
should
be
admitted,
while
the
statements
at
home
were
suppressed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
am
arguing
that
a
fruits
rule
applies
under
the
sixth
amendment.
i'm
conceding
that
by
virtue
of
the
court's
assumption
in
nix
v.
williams
and
its
holding
in
united
states
v.
wade.
but
the
case
of
a
defendant's
own
voluntary
statements
should
be
treated
as
a
special
case
under
a
fruits
rule
in
which
there
is
per
se
attenuation
in
the
form
of
an
independent
act
of
free
will
that
intervenes
between
the
violation
and
the
ensuing
waiver.
and
that
comes
about
when
the
defendant
receives
full
and
complete
information
about
his
rights.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
involuntariness
in
his
waiver
and
he
decides
to
speak.
the
ultimate
test
in
attenuation
law
is
was
there
an
independent
act
of
free
will
when
you're
speaking
of
a
confession
that
breaks
the
causal
link
to
the
prior
illegality.
here,
we
submit
as
a
matter
of
law
under
oregon
v.
elstad's
reasoning,
there
was.
thank
you.
