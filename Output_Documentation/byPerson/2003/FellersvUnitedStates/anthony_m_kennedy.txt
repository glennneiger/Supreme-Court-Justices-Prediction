do
police
officers
generally
know
this
distinction,
that
when
an
indictment
has
been
handed
down,
suddenly
the
sixth
amendment
is
in
the
case
as
well
as
the
fifth?
there's
an
element
of
fiction
to
it
in
that
the
person
doesn't
have
a
lawyer
yet.
as
a
bright
line
rule,
i
guess,
we
need
some
point
to
know
when
proceedings
have
commenced,
but
i...
i
still
think
there's
an
element
of
fiction
in
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
point
is
why...
why
should
that
make
a
difference
other
than
the
convenience
of
the
bright
line?
as
in
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical,
it
could
be
the
same
drug
ring,
the
same
investigation,
just
the
grand
jury
has...
hasn't
got
around
to
indicting
the
second
defendant
until
the
next
day
and
then
their
rights
are
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
waxman,
isn't
it
also
true
that
in
one
case
there
was
an
indictment,
in
the
other
there
wasn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
most
of
our
miranda
cases,
we
recognize
that
the...
the
police
nationwide
understand
the
dynamics
of
miranda.
i
have
no
empirical
basis,
and
apparently
you
don't
know
either.
my
assumption
is
most
police
officers
would
be
very
surprised
if
there's
a
difference
between
fifth
and
sixth--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--their
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
obligations
in...
in
this...
in
these
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
so
i
understand
what
the
sixth
amendment
rule
is,
if
the
sixth
amendment
prohibits
the
state
from
eliciting
statements
when
the
defend...
when
proceedings
have
begun,
outside
presence
of
counsel,
is
it
wrong
for
them
to
give
the
miranda
warning
and
if
he's
then
silent,
then
go
ahead
and
say,
now
you've
had
your
miranda
warning,
would
you
like
to
talk
to
us?
is
that
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment
rules
that
we
impose?
that
is
to
say,
can
you
elicit
the
statement
after
you've
given
the
waiver,
consistently
with
the
sixth
amendment
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they
can
attempt
to
elicit
that
waiver
consistently
with
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
that
wasn't
my
question.
can
they...
can
they
advise
him
of
those
rights,
he's
silent,
and
then
try
to
elicit
the
statement?
say,
now
we've
apprised
you
of
your
rights
and
we
want
you
to
talk
to
us.
is
that
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment?
