mr.
waxman,
you...
you're
making
a...
a
very
technical
distinction,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
if
we
focus
on
the
suspect
in
the
case
of
no
indictment
yet,
who
has
been
arrested,
and
the
person
who
has
been
indicted
and
then
arrested,
and
they're
both
alone
with
the
same
police
officers
in
the
same
jail
cell,
and
they're
both
subjected
to
the
same
interrogation.
why
should
the
derivative
evidence
rule
apply
to
the
one
or
not
the
other?
if
we're
talking
about
constitutional
rights,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
two
individuals
are
similarly
situated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
eighth...
the
eighth
circuit
said,
the
eighth
circuit
is
the
closest
court
to
this
one,
and
i
thought
that
the
eighth
circuit
said,
and
that
it's
a
threshold
question
in
this
case,
that
it
wasn't
anything
like
interrogation,
and
that
that's...
wasn't
that
the...
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--prime
ground
of
the
eighth
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
we
have
to
answer
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
the
eighth
circuit's
position
was
that
all
this
was
was
the
police
informing
the
defendant
that
he
had
been
charged
with
this
and
this
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
can
i...
mr.--
waxman,
can
i
just
clarify
that
we
do
have
the
threshold
question
in
this
case,
right?
because
as
it
stands
in
the
eighth
circuit,
you
don't
even
have
a
foot
in
the
door
because
there
was
no
interrogation,
it
was
only...
so
we
have
to
overturn
the
eighth
circuit
on
that
point
before
we
get
to
what
you're
now
talking
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
should
make
the
case...
that
case
that
we
heard
yesterday
easier
than
this
one
if
that's
the
standard,
because
there,
the
first
unwarned
set
of
questions
was
much
more
intense,
much
more
detailed
than
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
do...
do
i
understand
correctly
that
essentially
you
are
saying
that
mr.
waxman
in
wrong
in
bracketing
the
sixth
amendment
with
the
fourth
amendment,
that
it
belongs
with
the
fifth
amendment?
and
one,
it
seems
to
me,
large
difference
between
the
two
of
you
is
mr.
waxman
describes
the
sixth
amendment
violation
of...
as
occurring
on
the
spot.
you
have
said
in
your
brief
it's
just
like
the
fifth
amendment.
it's
sort
of
inchoate
until
the
government
seeks
to
introduce
it
at
a
trial.
is
that
still
your
view,
so
that
the...
the
right
to
counsel
isn't
complete...
the
violation
isn't
complete
until
the
government
makes
an
effort
to
introduce
it
at
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
if...
if
the...
we
describe
that
right,
that
sixth
amendment
amendment
right
as
a
right
to
counsel
at
every
critical
stage
in
the
criminal
proceeding,
then
that
sounds
like
there's
a
critical
stage
and
you
haven't
been
told
and
haven't
waived
your
right
to
a
lawyer,
the
violation
is
complete.
