justice
david
h.
souter
mr....
mr.
waxman,
i...
i
will
assume
that
that
is
correct.
i
mean,
i...
the
record
looks
to
me
just
as
you're
describing
it.
but
assuming
that,
do
you
think
there
is
any
practical
difference
between
what
deputy
bliemeister
did
here
and
what
the
officer
did
in
elstad?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in...
in
elstad,
the...
there
were
two
officers,
one
went
with
the
mother
of
the
suspect
into
the
kitchen
to
tell
her
why
they
were
there.
the
other
one...
excuse
me...
stayed
in
another
room
with
the...
with
the
boy
who
was
the
suspect
and
started
telling
them
what
they
were
there
to...
to
investigate,
there
was
a
burglary
next
door.
and
at
the
end
of
the
conversation
that's
quoted
in
the
opinion
he
said,
you
know,
i...
i
think
you
may
know
something
about
that,
and
the
boy
said,
yes
he
did.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
elicitation
there
was
functionally
about
the
same
as
the
elicitation
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
want
to
know
whether
you
agree.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
yeah,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to...
to
say
to
a
kid,
you
know,
i
think
you
may
know
something
about
this,
and
the
person
making
that
statement's
a
cop,
sounds
like
elicitation
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
functionally...
if...
if
functionally
it
is,
let's
assume...
i...
i
tend
to
think
it
is...
and...
and
functionally
in
each
case,
whether
it's
fifth
amendment
right
or
sixth
amendment
right,
the
statement
doesn't
come
in
unless
there
is,
among
other
things,
a
voluntary
waiver
of
the
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel
then
and
there.
and
in...
in
each
case
we
didn't
have
it.
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
why
in
functional
terms
it
should
make
a
difference
whether
we're
talking
about
sixth
or
fifth
and
why
there
should
be
a
difference
between
this
case
and
elstad.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
neither
does
the
sixth.
the...
what
the
sixth
says
is,
before
you
try
anything
like
that,
you've
either
got
to
have
his
counsel
present
or
his
counsel
permission
or
his
waiver
of
it.
what's
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
recognize
he's
got
that
right
because
there
was
the
indictment.
and
in
the
fifth
amendment
case,
the
miranda
case,
we
recognized
that
he's
got
that
right,
because
this
court
has
said
that's
the
only
way
you're
going
to
make
the
fifth
amendment
work.
so
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
he's
got
the
right,
and
that
in
fact
the
elicitation
or
statements
that
produce
his
statement
are...
are...
are
improper.
his
statement
is
inadmissible
unless
there's
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel
at
that
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
isn't
the...
the...
isn't
the...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
think
your
theory
is
that
the
waiver
itself
is
likely
to
be
a
fruit
because
a
person
is
going
to
say,
i've
already
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag,
what
do
i
need
a
lawyer
for.
is...
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
they
say,
we're
here
to
discuss
with
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
it
bliemeister's
statement,
i'm
here
to
discuss
with
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
discuss
is
something
that
involves
other
than...
something
involving
more
than
a
monologue.
so
i
mean,
i...
as
justice
scalia
said,
i...
it
might
make
it
clearer
if
he
had
said
with
you
each
time,
but
without
the
with
you,
discuss
implies
give
and
take.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
a
constitutional
deficiency.
i
mean,
we're
playing
with
words.
what
we're
saying
in
the
counsel
cases
is,
if
we
have
to
go
back
and
unring
the
bell,
we
want
something
more
than
simply
the
deficiency.
we
want
to
know
that
requiring
a
new
trial
or
whatever
is
likely
to
make
a
difference.
the
question
here
is...
is
asked,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg's
question
is
asked
on
a
prospective
basis.
and
that
is,
at
the
time
the...
the
police
question
without
counsel,
is
that
a
violation
of
the...
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
your...
your
answer
a
moment
ago
was,
the
only
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
was
the
denial
of
the...
of
the
opportunity
to
waive.
but
he's
got
to
have
an
opportunity
to
waive
something,
and
i
suppose
that
implies
that
he
has,
at
least
on
a
prospective
basis,
a
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel
there
if
the
police
are
going
to
question
him,
absent
a...
a
waiver.
