justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
the
finding
of
the
magistrate
and
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--he
found
deliberate
eliciting
of
the
comments
at
the
first
statement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
because
of
the
eighth
circuit's
position
on
the
original
statements,
it
really
didn't
address
the
subsequent
jailhouse
statements
in
any
proper
fashion,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
suppose...
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
first
statement
and
conclude
they
were
deliberately
elicited,
we'd
have
to
remand,
i
suppose--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
the
second
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
except
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
address
that
second
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
certainly
the...
the...
the
defendant
can
waive
his
right
to
counsel
later
on,
and
he
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
he
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
tainted
simply
because
if
we
find
a
violation
originally?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
he
can
certainly
waive
his
sixth
amendment
right
later.
i
just
don't
understand
why
what
you
say
necessarily
follows.
we've
never
held
that
squarely,
have
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
eighth
circuit
ever
decide
whether
there
was
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
at
the
jailhouse?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
that
perhaps
since
they
didn't
think
the
first
statement
posed
a
problem
that
they
never
really
got
to
the
crux
of
the
jailhouse
inquiry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
can
the
police
approach
a
person
and
deliberately
elicit
statements
without
advising
him
of
his
right
to
counsel
after
indictment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
have
we
looked
to
whether
the
statement
was
deliberately
elicited?
has
that
been
our
understanding
of
what
we'd
look
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
should
we
apply
that
test
here
to
those
early
statements?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
so-called
deliberate
elicitation
standard,
modified
or
not,
then
what,
with
regard
to
the
subsequent
conversation
of
the
jail,
after
the
warnings
had
been
given?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
that
determination
has
been
made
knowing
and
voluntariness
as
to
the
jailhouse
statement--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--by
the
court
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
fruits--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
nix
v.
williams
case
bears
on
it
to
some
extent,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
a
sixth
amendment
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
and
the
court
in
nix
made
it
pretty
clear
that
we
assumed
there
would
be
a
fruits
suppression.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
applied
some
other
reason
to
let
the
body--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
that
has
a
textual
support
in
the
constitutional
language
itself.
