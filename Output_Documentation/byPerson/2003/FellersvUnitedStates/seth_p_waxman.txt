mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
the
two
cases
in
which
you
heard
argument
yesterday,
and
unlike
oregon
v.
elstad,
the
original
inculpatory
statement
in
this
case
was
elicited
not
merely
in
violation
of
a
prophylactic
rule,
but
of
the
constitution
itself,
specifically
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
an
accused
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
throughout
his
criminal
prosecution,
a
right
designed
to
protect
equality
in
the
adversarial
process
by
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it's...
your
honor,
i
guess
i
have
a
two-fold
answer.
first
of
all,
the...
the
constitutional
right
involved
is
the
sixth
amendment
right,
unlike
in
miranda,
the
fifth
amendment
right
of
self-incrimination.
and
in...
in
oregon
v.
elstad
and
chavez
v.
martinez,
this
court
recognized
that
although
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
right
is
not
completed
until
the
statement
or
its
fruits
are
introduced
at
trial,
the
primary
illegality,
as
this
court
has
used
the
phrase,
is
the
coercion
of
the
confession,
and
the
elstad
rule
doesn't
apply
where
the
primary
illegality
is
constitutionally-proscribed
conduct.
and
here,
this
court
has
not
formally
decided
whether
the
sixth
amendment
is
violated
at
the
time
the
uncounseled,
post-indictment
statement
is
deliberately
elicited,
or
only
when
the
statement
or
fruits
are
admitted,
that
briefs
of
both
sides
rehearse
for
the
court
somewhat
conflicting
statements
in
different
opinions.
we
rely
on
the
cases
cited
in
footnote
5
on
page
8
of
our
reply
brief,
but
for
purposes
of
this
case,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
matter,
because
in
elstad,
this
court
made
clear,
and
reiterated
in
chavez,
that
although
the
fifth
amendment
violation
is
incomplete
at
the
time
a
confession
is
coerced,
nonetheless
the
fruits
of
that
confession
have
to
be
suppressed
under
the
derivative
evidence
rule,
unless
the
government
carries
its
burden
to
prove
sufficient
attenuation
of
taint.
and
therefore,
even
if
the
conduct
deliberately
eliciting
from
mr.
fellers
his
inculpatory
statement
at
a
time
when
the
officers
knew
he
had
been
indicted,
and
the
prosecution
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
the
advice
of
counsel,
the
fruits
of
that
statement
under
nix
and
wade
have
to
be
suppressed.
that's
a
rule
that
this
court
has
applied
in
fourth
amendment,
fifth
amendment,
and
sixth
amendment
cases.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
i
would
call
it
fiction.
i'm
no
more
able
to...
to
testify
than
the
member
of
this
court
would
be
as
to
exactly
what
training
the
police
are
told.
but
this
court
has
long
established,
long
maintained
that
the
sixth
amendment
cuts
very
bright
lines.
it
is
specific
to
the
offense
and
it
begins
only
when,
but
when,
the
state
makes
the
unilateral
determination
to
change
its
formal
relationship
with
an
individual
from
one
in
which
the
individual
may
or
may
not
be
under
investigation,
but
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
they...
they
aren't,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
this
is
a
matter
of
technicality
or
formality.
it
is
a
matter
of
formalism,
but
the
two
different
amendments...
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
throughout
criminal
prosecution,
protect
very
different
things.
the
first
protects
voluntariness,
and
the
second
protects
the
right
of
someone
as
to
whom
the
government
has
formally
set
its
face
and
invoked
a
formal
adversarial
process.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
your...
your
honor,
it's...
it
is
entirely
true
that
if
the
court
agrees
with...
agrees
with
our
submission
here,
that
the
government
can
very
easily
conform
its
conduct
simply
by
not
conducting
uncounseled
interrogations
or
elicitations
prior
to
changing
its
status.
but
the...
the...
we
have
to
examine,
this
court
has
exhorted
counsel
over
and
over
again
to
be
clear
about
what
the
underlying
right
is
protected
in
determining
what
the
appropriate
remedy
is.
and
the
right
here
is
not
coercion.
the
right
here
is
not
just
addressed
at
police.
it's
addressed
at
the
prosecution.
and
there
is
a
difference.
you
may
call
it
technical,
but
it
is
in
fact
the
hallmark
of
our
adversary
system
that
once
the
government
decides
to
invoke
a
formal
adversary
process,
it
proceeds
on
the
supposition
that
each
side
deals
with
each
other,
a,
at
arm's
length,
and
b,
assisted
by
the
advice
of
counsel,
who
will
prevent
each
side,
and
in
particularly
the
defendant,
from,
as
this
court
has
explained
in...
from
conviction
resulting
from
his
own
ignorance
of
his
legal
and
constitutional
rights,
and
that's
what's
being
protected.
the
unindicted
individual,
as
to
whom
the
government
may
be
conducting
an
investigation,
doesn't
have
that
formal
right,
but
once
the
government
invokes
our
adversarial
system,
it
invokes
a
set
of
protections
that
protect,
not
an
individual's
right
to
be
protected
from
coercion
or
involuntariness...
that's
protected
no
matter
when
the
custodial--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh
no,
of
course
not.
your
honor
has
made
clear
for
the...
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
patterson
v.
illinois...
i
believe
it
was
your
honor...
in
any
event,
the
court
made
clear
in
patterson
v.
illinois
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
doesn't
prevent
the
government
from
eliciting
statements
from
an
indicted
defendant.
it
requires
that
the
accused
either
have
counsel
or
make
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel,
and
the
court--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
only
is
a
violation
of
a
right,
your
honor,
if
what...
if
the
police
statements
and
conduct
amount
to
what
this
court
has
deemed
deliberate
elicitation.
that
is,
that
what
the
court
has
said
in
a
half
a
dozen
cases
is
that
the
government
may
not
do
without
counsel
is
deliberately
elicit
incriminating
statements
in
the
absence
of
his
lawyer.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
am...
i
am
absolutely
certain
that
that's
what
happened
here,
and
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
the
magistrate
who
heard
that
police
officers,
justice
o'connor,
found
specifically
that
officers--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
he
said
it
was,
quote,
designed
to
elicit
a
response...
i'm
quoting
from
page
103
of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it's...
i
think,
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
it's...
this
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
under
miller
v.
fenton
and
thompson
v.
keohane.
but
because--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
eighth--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
ginsburg,
the
eighth
circuit...
two
judges,
the
majority,
the
panel
in
the
eighth
circuit,
concluded
that
it
wasn't
interrogation.
the
concurring
judge--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--pointed
out,
judge
riley
pointed
out,
that
under
the
sixth
amendment,
unlike
the
fifth,
interrogation
is
not
the
standard.
the
standard
is
deliberate
elicitation,
or,
as
this
court
has
also
phrased
it,
whether
the
prosecution,
quote,
intentionally
creates
a
situation
likely
to
induce
the
accused
to
make
incriminating
statements
without
the
advise
of
counsel.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is...
the...
the...
i
don't
believe
the
eighth
circuit
made
any
such
finding,
but
the
magistrate
who
heard
the
two
officers
testify
and
evaluated
their
credibility
made
a
determination,
justice
scalia,
that
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
the
inquiry
under
the
sixth
amendment,
deliberate
elicitation
or
intentional
creation
of
a
situation,
or
purposeful
conduct,
which
are
the
words
this
court
has
used,
involve
a
determination,
among
other
things,
about
the
credibility
of
what
the
officers
said.
and
when
the
magistrate
concluded
that
they...
that
their
conduct
was
designed
to
elicit
a
response,
and
that
it
was
not
made
for
any
purpose
other
than
to
get
a
response--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
was
no
debate
about
what
they
said,
but...
but
there
was
a
credibility
finding
made
by
the
magistrate,
because
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
when
you
have...
when
you...
because
there
is
a
subjective
intent
here,
the
subjective
intent
of
whether
officer
bliemeister,
he
came
to
the
house
knowing
that
this
man
had
been
indicted,
and
said,
we
are
here
to
discuss
with
you
your
involvement
with
methamphetamine
and
your
involvement
with
four
individuals.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
your
honor,
i'm...
i'm
simply
reciting
back
for...
for
you
the
court's
instructions,
and...
and
saying
that
if
the
standard
is
deliberate
elicitation
and
intentionally
creating
a
situation,
it
essentially,
in
terms
of
providing
a
line,
it
proscribes
what
the
police
may
not
deliberately
do,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but
deliberateness,
i
think,
is
a
finding
of
the
magistrate,
which...
to
which
the
eighth
circuit
and
this
court
owe
deference.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
your
honor,
perhaps,
but
designed
to
elicit,
it
strikes
me
as
including
a
subjective
component.
but
even
if
i'm
wrong,
i
submit
that
the
magistrate
was
correct
as
an
a
priori
matter
in
saying,
look,
these
people...
these
officers...
these
agents
of
the
prosecution,
came
to
this
man's
house.
they
not
only
knew
he
had
been
indicted,
officer
bliemeyer
had
been
the
witness--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--bliemeister...
had
been
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury,
and
he
comes--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
remember
what
the
officer
did
in
elstad.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i
actually
don't
agree.
i
think...
i
think
for
other
reasons,
that
is,
the...
the
fact
that
this
is
a
sixth
amendment
it
doesn't
matter.
but
i
do
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--when
the
police
officers
come
and
say,
we
are
here
to
discuss
with
you
the
following
things,
which
happened
to
be
the
precise
things
that
he
has
just
been
indicted
for,
that
is
a
paradigm...
paradigmatic
deliberate
elicitation.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
if...
if...
mr.--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--because
the
functional
analysis
depends
on
the
right
being
protected.
the
fifth
amendment
right
does
not
embed
a
policy
against
deliberate
elicitation
of
information
from
suspects.
in
fact,
our
system
embraces
that.
and
if
there
was
a
violation
in
elstad,
it
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it...
the
difference
is
what's
being
protected.
what's
being
protected
in
the
fifth
is
coercion.
what's
being
protected
in
the
sixth
in
this
instance
is
precisely
what--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
yes.
and
what
the
sixth
amendment
protects
in
terms,
justice
souter,
is
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
absolutely.
and
that
gets
us
right
to
elstad,
and
the
line
that
this
court
drew
in
elstad
at
the
very
outset
of
its
opinion,
which
is
that
the
consequences
of
an
interrogation
in
violation
of
miranda
differ
importantly
from
the
consequences
of
a
violation
of
the
constitution
itself,
that
is,
primary
illegality
that
goes
directly,
without
prophylaxis,
to
what
the
constitution
proscribes.
and
this
court
said
over
and
over
and
over
again
in
elstad
that
we
will
not
apply
a
derivative
evidence
rule
where
the
violation
is
only
the
former,
but
we
will
apply
it
in
the
latter.
and
that
is
the
key
distinction
in
this
case.
the
distinction
is
not
that
the
statements
that
they
elicited
from
mr.
fellers
at
his
home
didn't
also
violate
miranda,
if
he
was
in
custody
and
the
court
found
that
he
was,
they
did.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but
justice
kennedy,
i
submit
to
you
that
it
doesn't
matter
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
prophylaxis.
it
may
very
well...
what
the
police
officers
know
is,
they
knew
they
had
to
give
him
his
miranda
warnings
there.
that
we
can
be
sure
of.
and
they
also
knew
that
there
would
be
consequences
for
not
doing
it,
and
this
is
not
just
the
police.
if
it...
if
it
please
the
court,
this
is
the
prosecution.
once
there
is
an
indictment,
the
police
are
not
acting
on
their
own.
the
police
are
part
of
the
government
prosecution,
and
if
police
don't
know
that,
and
are
trying
to
game
the
system
the
way
we
heard
it
yesterday,
it's
the
burden
of
the
prosecution...
the
prosecution
and
the
government
to
make
sure
that
they
do
understand
that.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
preservation
of...
as
this
court
has
said
it...
equality...
equality
of
each
side
once
the
government
unilaterally
define...
changes
its
posture
with
respect
to
someone
so
that
that
person
is
accused,
and
when
it
does
that,
it
has
to
make...
it
has
to
take
steps
to
avoid
interfering
with
the
ability
of
the
defendant
at
all
critical
stages
and
all
confrontations
to
proceed
based
on
ignorance
or
misapprehension
of
his
rights
or
the
legal
consequences.
i
realize
this
sounds
like--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
your
honor.
now,
the...
the
eighth
circuit
was
incorrect,
because
it
applied
the
wrong
standard.
it
asked
whether
there
was
interrogation,
when
this
court
made
clear
in
rhode
island
v.
innis
that
that
is
not
the
test
under
the
sixth
amendment
for
good
reasons,
and
in
any
event,
this
was
the,
quote,
functional
equivalent
of
interrogation.
i
mean--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
it...
it
said...
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
is,
look,
we
don't
think
that
there
was
a
primary
illegality,
and
therefore,
we
don't
have
to
discuss--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--what
the
fruits
consequences
are.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
because
the
question
presented
in
the
petition,
the
second
question
presented
in
the
petition
is,
okay,
assuming
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
the
first
interrogation,
does
the
invocation,
the
mere
invocation
of
miranda
warnings,
cleanse
that
taint?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
would.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'll...
i'll
answer
justice
o'connor's
question
first
and
then
your
question.
justice
o'connor,
the...
the...
the
point
here
is
that
this
court
has
uniformly
held
that
where
there
is
conduct
that
constitutes
primary
illegality
in
violation
of
the
fourth,
fifth,
or
sixth
amendments,
not
just
a
prophylactic
rule,
but
the
constitutional
requirement
itself,
the
remedy
is,
you
apply
the
derivative
evidence
rule,
which
puts
the
burden
on
the
government
to
prove
that
the
taint
has
sufficiently
attenuated.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
he
absolutely
can.
and
our
case
doesn't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--he--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--our...
our
case,
your
honor,
doesn't
depend
on
any
argument
or
showing
that
the
second
statement
was
either
involuntary
or
that
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
was
not
knowing
and
intelligent.
our
submission
is
that
the
second
statement
is
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree,
just
as
if
it
were
a
piece
of
inanimate
evidence.
there's
nothing
wrong
if
somebody
said...
with
what
the...
if
police
going
and
finding
the
body
in
the
nix
case,
the
christian
burial
case,
but
it's
tainted
because
they
got
the...
that
information
derived
from
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
had
not
up
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
you...
you
have
never
held
in
a
sixth
amendment--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you've
never
held
the...
the
precise
question
that's
presented
here
for
sure.
but
you
have
held
that
where
there
is
conduct
that
violates
the
sixth
amendment,
this
is
nix
and
wade,
the
fruits
of
that
conduct,
regardless
of
what
happens
thereafter,
are
excludable
as
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree,
unless
the
government
shoulders
its
taint-attenuation
burden.
and
you
have
also
held
in
a
variety
of
cases
that,
starting
with
wong
sun,
that
where
the
fruit
is
testimonial
evidence,
it
too
has
to
be
excluded
with
the
understanding
that
the
administer...
the
intervening
administration
of
miranda
warnings
are
potent
evidence,
but
they
are
not
sufficient
in
and
of
themselves
to
establish
taint
attenuation.
you
said
it
in
brown.
you
said
it
last
term
in
kaupp
v.
texas.
you've
said
it
in
dunaway
and
any
number
of
other
cases.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
first
statement
in
the
first...
i
mean,
as
a...
that...
this
is
a
sort
of
a
common
sense,
practical
analysis,
but
in
the
first
statement
he
was...
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
used
methamphetamines
and
he
had
associated
with
the
four
individuals
that
the
police
officer
named.
and
you,
justice
breyer,
the
indictment
was
conspiracy
to
possess
methamphetamines
with
intent
to
distribute
and
to
distribute.
he
made
very
inculpatory
statements.
thirty
minutes
later,
he
executes
a
miranda
warning...
waiver...
in
the
station
house,
and
he
is
asked,
okay,
tell
us
more
about
this
possession
and
tell
us
person
by
person
about
your
association
with
those
four
people.
they
then
go
on
and
ask
more
questions
about
other
people,
but
in
this
case,
the
link
between
the
two
is
as
direct
as
one
can
possibly
imagine.
i
mean,
this
court
has
established
a...
has
long
recognized
a
presumption
that
where
the...
when
the
government
acquires
evidence
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
any
substantially
similar
evidence
obtained
by
the
police
subsequent
to
that
derives
from
it
unless
the
government
can
prove
it
doesn't.
that
was
waived.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
taint--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--your
honor,
the
taint--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
taint,
which
this
court
in
elstad,
in
part
iia
of
its
opinion
in
elstad,
said
was
insufficient...
iib...
was
insufficient
to
prove
involuntariness,
is
in
fact
what
demonstrates
that
there
is
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
here
in
the
link,
and
that
is
the
accepted,
common
sense
proposition
that
an
uncounseled
accused,
from
whom
the
government
deliberately
elicits
an
unwarned,
incriminatory
statement
after
it
institutes
adversarial
proceedings,
is
erroneously
likely
to
believe
that
there
is
little
to
be
gained
and
much
to
be
lost
from
attempting
to
avoid
further
incrimination.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
this
court
recognized
it
in
bayer,
in
brown,
in--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
in
brown,
for
example,
it
said
that
the
second
warrant
statement,
quote,
was
clearly
the
result
and
fruit
of
the
first.
the
fact
that
brown
had
made
one
statement
believed
by
him
to
be
admissible
bolstered
the
pressures
for
him
to
give
the
second,
or
at
least
vitiated
any
incentive
on
his
part
to
avoid
self-incrimination.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is
the
same
thing.
in
that
case
they
were
talking
about
the
second
statement,
which
was
preceded
by
a
waiver
of
counsel,
and
making
not
the,
your
honor,
not
the
legal
judgment
that
the
second
statement
was
there
for
coerced
or
involuntary,
but
the
practical...
what
this
court
has
described
as
the
psychological
and
practical
disadvantage
of
having
confessed
a
first
time
can
be
regarded
as
a
fruit
of
the
first.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
that's...
as--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--as...
as
justice
harlan
stated
in
his
concurrence
in
darwin,
which
is
only
a
concurrence,
but
i
think
is
sort
of
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
rejected
it,
your
honor,
as
evidence
or
as
constituting
or...
or
eliciting
a
presumption
of
involuntariness.
but
you
did
it
only
after...
in
part
iia
of
your
opinion
in
elstad,
you
said,
derivative
evidence
rule
doesn't
apply.
fruits
are
not
going
to
be
excluded
from
elstad...
from
a
miranda
violation.
now,
the
court
said
in
part
iib,
now
we
have
to
deal
with
the
contention
that
he
says
it's
involuntary,
and
his
only
evidence
that
it's
involuntary
is
that
it
was
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
and
there
was
this
psychological
compulsion.
that's
too
attenuated
and
hypothetical
to
constitute
a
presumption
of
compulsion,
but
it
is
precisely
what
this
court
has
recognized
in
brown
and
dunaway
and
bayer
and
taylor
and
harrison
as
being
a
psychological
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
and
the...
the
only
burden
in
the...
in
the
case
yesterday
that
i
don't
have
is
that
the
primary
illegality
was
a
violation
of
miranda,
and
not
of
the
fifth
amendment
prohibition
against
coerced
confessions
itself.
thank
you.
