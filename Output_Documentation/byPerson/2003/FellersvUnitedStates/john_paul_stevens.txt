justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
dreeben,
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
the
facts,
but
you're
relying
on
the
waiver
at
the
station
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
prior
to
that
waiver
there
had
already
been
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then...
then
you
don't
need
the
waiver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
was
deliberate
elicitation.
would
you
say
it
was
a
violation
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
even
if
there
was
no
waiver
at
the
home,
there...
there
still
was
no
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
a
rather
extreme
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
the
sometimes
yes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
this
is...
this
was
an
offense-specific
interrogation
if
it...
if
was
an
interrogation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
there's
an
analogy
to
civil
cases
here.
supposing
you
just
had
a
civil
lawsuit
pending
against
the
person
and
after
it's
filed,
wouldn't
there
be
an
ethical
obligation
on...
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
not
to
send
agents
out
to
question
your
adversary
in
the
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he's
known
not
to
be
represented,
that's
my
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
i'm
assuming
that
the...
the
government
is
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
dreeben,
it's...
the
thought
runs
through
my
mind
that
if
he
were
to
waive
counsel
in
front
of
a
judge
in
a
trial
setting,
the
judge
would
ask
him
a
lot
of
questions
and
be
sure
the
waiver
was
intelligent
and
voluntary
and
so
forth.
and
you're
suggesting,
at
the
time
he's
first
indicted
when
the
police
approach
him,
he
doesn't
need
any
of
that
guidance
at
all.
if
he
just
answers
the
question,
that's
sufficient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
rather
dramatic
difference
in
the
kind
of
waiver
of
this
very
important
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
you
didn't
even
have
the
miranda
warning
here--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--at
the
home.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
it
is
a
rather...
rather
strange
that
the
judges
are
as
careful
as
they
are
in
a
trial
setting,
whereas
the
police
can
just
do
what
they
did
here?
does
that...
doesn't
trouble
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
actually,
in...
in
a
situation
like
this,
the
whole
outcome
of
the
proceeding
is
determined
by
what
happened
in
his
home.
