no,
it
wasn't
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
would
you
like
to
say
something
about
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
i...
in
looking
at
it,
i
want...
would
like
you
to
address
the
particular
argument.
first,
the
questioning
at
the
house
was
about
whether
he'd
ever
participated
in
taking
drugs
with
these
people.
the
relevant
question
was
whether
he
distributed
drugs
at
the
station.
they
did
ask
him
if
he
wanted
a
lawyer.
he
did
consciously
waive
it.
and
therefore,
in
fact,
since
this
case
is
about
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
maybe
if
he'd
had
a
lawyer
it
would
have
made
a
difference,
but
it's
hard
to
see
how
the
decision
not
to
have
the
lawyer
flowed
from
the
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they're
different
subject
matters.
time
passes
and
it's
pretty
attenuated
to
say
that
that
first
violation
led
him
to
the
second.
all
right.
those
are
the
arguments,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
question
basically,
because
i
think
that's
an
important
question
and...
and
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
and
when
the
government
violates
the
right
to
the
lawyer,
like
the
fourth
amendment
or
any
other
amendment,
they
can't
use
a
fruit.
now,
oregon
v.
elstad
is
talking
about
a
right
that
isn't
complete
until
you
fail
to
introduce
the...
until
you
use
it
as
testimony
at
trial,
and
therefore
oregon
v.
elstad
is
a
different,
and
considerably
more
lenient
test.
i
confess
i
always
would
have
thought
until
this
moment
that
our
court
cases
said
you
apply
the
fruits
because
the
violation
is
complete.
now,
it
seems
to
me
in
advocating
the
second,
you're
advocating
a
considerable
change,
but
whether
it's
a
change
or
not
a
change,
i
want
to
know
the
reason
for
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
but
as
to
the
first,
my
constitution
says
you
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
not...
of
course
you
can
waive
it,
like
anybody...
other
right.
but
that's
quite
different
than
the
fifth
amendment
right,
which
is
a
right
not
to
testify
against
yourself,
which
is
in
complete
to
a
trial.
as
to
the
second,
of
course,
attenuation
is
relevant.
it's
relevant
under
the
tree...
fruits
doctrine.
it's
relevant
under
elstad.
so
if
you
prove
attenuation,
fine.
so,
given
those
two
things,
why
do
we
have
to
change
the
law
here?
or
is
it
a
change?
