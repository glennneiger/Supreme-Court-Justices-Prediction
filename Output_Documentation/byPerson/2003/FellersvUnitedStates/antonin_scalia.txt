justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
factual
finding
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
a
legal
conclusion?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
he
can...
he
can
find
as
a
fact
what
the
officer
said,
but
whether
it
constitutes
deliberate
elicitation
within
the
meaning
of
our...
of
our
opinion,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
legal
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
deliberateness
may
refer
to
nothing
more
than
intending
the
statement
that
was
made,
and
whether
it
elicits
or
not,
or
whether
it
constitutes
elicitation...
what
a
terrible
word...
whether
it
constitutes
elicitation,
it
seems
to
me,
can
be
judged
objectively,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
the
second
statement
the
fruit
of
the
first?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
under...
i
can
understand
the
position,
although
i'm
not
entirely
persuaded
by
it,
that
where...
when
you
are
violate...
have
violated
the
fifth
amendment
and
gotten
a
confession
that's
already
on
the
table,
the
second
confession
is
sort
of
the
fruit
of
that,
because
the
person
thinks,
what
the
heck,
i've
already
confessed,
i
may
as
well...
that's
the
argument
that
it's
the
fruit.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't...
but
i
don't
see
how
the
waiver
of...
of
counsel
the
second
time
is
the...
is
the
fruit
of
the
improper
approach
the
first
time.
i
mean,
i...
i
don't
see
somebody
saying,
what
the
heck,
i
waived
counsel
the
first
time,
i
may
as
well
waive
it
the
second.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
follow
the
way...
the
way
confession
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
who...
who...
who
would
you
go
to?
if
he
hasn't
appointed
counsel
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
he's
filed
the
case...
he's
filed
the
case
pro
se.
who
would
you
approach
if
you
don't
approach
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
telling...
telling
is
not
discussing.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
why
the
phrase,
with
you,
is
essential
when
the
only
person
in
the
room
is...
is...
is
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
somebody
comes
in
and
says,
i'm
here
to
discuss,
you
know,
whatever.
who
else
are
you
going
to
discuss
it
with
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
at...
at
least
if
there's
nobody
else
in
the
room.
i
mean,
if
there's
a
crowd
of
people
and
you
say,
i'm
here
to
discuss
something,
maybe
you're
going
to
discuss
it
with
the
other
people.
that's
fine,
but...
but
it...
this
was
one-on-one.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i...
i
think...
i
think
he
would
say
it
is
a
fruit
because
it
is
not
totally
voluntary,
given
the
fact
that
he
had
already
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
i...
i...
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
he
would
acknowledge
that
the
second
waiver...
that
the
waiver
of
counsel
in
the
second
interrogation
was
entirely
free,
given
what
had
preceded.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the...
the
other
way
to
look
at
is
upside
down.
i
mean,
if...
if
you
concede
that
there's
a
sixth
amendment
violation
immediately,
you're
still
free
to
argue
that...
that
in...
in
the
miranda
case,
there's
also
a
fifth
amendment
violation
immediately.
now,
you
couldn't
do
that
with
elstad,
but
after
dickerson,
you
can
certainly
argue
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
are...
are
you
arguing
that
the
fruits
rule
does
not
apply,
or
are
you
arguing
that
this
is
not
the
fruits?
