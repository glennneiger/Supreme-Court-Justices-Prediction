argument
now
in
no.
02-6320,
john
j.
fellers
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority,
mr.
waxman,
for
saying
that
this
is
different
from
the
miranda
warnings
in
the
sense
that
it's...
it's
an
immediate
violation
rather
than
something...
something
like
miranda?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how...
how
far
does
this
right
go,
mr.
waxman?
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
police
officers
can't
talk
to
someone
who
has
been
indicted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it's...
it's...
i'm...
i'm
talking
about
a
situation
where,
say
the
police
simply
say
something
to
a...
an
indicted
defendant.
there's
no
violation
of
a
right
there,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
think
that's
what
happened
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was...
was
there
any
debate
or
controversy
about
what
they
in
fact
said?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
was...
if
there
was
no
factual
dispute,
why...
why
did...
why
was
credibility
involved?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why...
why
should
subjective
intent
make
any
difference
here?
i
mean,
the...
the
effect
on
the...
on
the
accused
is
exactly
the
same.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bliemeister,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
but
is
there...
is
there
some
authority
for
that
specific
proposition
that
you
just
said?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
say...
i...
i'm...
you...
you
just
recited
kind
of
a
litany.
did
the
court
recite
that
sort
of
a
litany
in
bayer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that...
that's
a...
that's
a
first
statement.
that's...
you're...
you're
talking
here
about
a
waiver
of
counsel
and
you're
saying
that's
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that...
that's...
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
is
what
we
rejected
in
elstad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
02-6320,
fellers
against
united
states
which
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
two
police
officers
visited
the
petitioner,
a
man
named
john
j.
fellers,
at
his
home
in
nebraska.
the
officers
told
him
that
they
have
come
to
discuss
his
involvement
in
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
methamphetamine
that
involves
several
other
individual
whom
they
named.
they
said
that
fellers
had
been
indicted
and
that
they
have
a
warrant
for
his
arrest.
during
a
brief
discussion,
fellers
admitted
to
having
used
methamphetamine
during
his
association
with
the
named
individuals.
the
officers
transported
him
to
the
county
jail
where
they
informed
him
of
his
rights
under
the
miranda
and
patterson
cases.
after
he
waived
those
rights,
fellers
reiterated
his
earlier
enculpatory
statement.
at
trial,
the
district
court
suppressed
the
unwarrant
statements
that
fellers
made
at
his
home
but
not
his
jail
house
statements.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
holding
that
the
jail
house
statements
were
admissible
under
the
rule
of
oregon
against
elstad,
a
case
of
ours
from
about
20
years
ago,
and
that
the
officers
did
not
violate
petitioner’s
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
because
they
did
not
interrogate
him
at
his
home.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
o’connor,
we
now
reverse.
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
triggered
when
judicial
proceedings
have
been
initiated
against
an
individual
such
as
an
indictment.
we
have
held
that
an
accused
is
denied
that
right
when
officers
deliberately
elicit
incriminating
statements
from
him
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
officers
here
did
deliberately
elicit
fellers’
original
incriminating
statement
when
they
told
him
that
they
had
come
to
discuss
his
involvement
in
methamphetamine
checking.
the
court
of
appeals
was
therefore
wrong
in
holding
that
the
absence
of
an
interrogation
foreclosed
fellers’
sixth
amendment
claim.
because
of
that
determination,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
question
whether
fellers’
jail
house
statement
should
be
suppressed
as
the
fruits
of
questioning
conducted
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
we
have
had
no
occasion
to
decide
whether
the
rationale
of
oregon
against
elstad
applies
in
that
context.
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
address
that
issue
in
the
first
instance.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
