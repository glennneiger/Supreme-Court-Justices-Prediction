this
case
concerns
the
authority
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
or
epa
to
superintend
enforcement
of
the
clean
air
act.
two
provisions
of
the
act
expansively
empower
epa
to
enforce
any
of
the
act’s
requirements.
the
requirement
at
issue
relates
to
the
clean
air
act's
prevention
of
significant
deterioration
or
psd
program.
as
its
name
indicates,
the
psd
program
is
designed
to
maintain
air
quality
in
areas
still
relatively
free
of
pollution.
psd
provisions
require
receipt
of
a
permit
before
constructing
or
modifying
a
large
air
pollutant
emitting
facility.
to
gain
a
permit,
the
applicant
must
show
that
the
insulation
is
equipped
with
the
best
available
control
technology
or
for
short,
bact.
the
act
defines
bact
as
the
technology
that
results
in
the
maximum
degree
of
pollutant
reduction
achievable
taking
account
of
energy,
environmental,
and
economic
factors.
the
permit
authority
in
this
case,
is
the
petitioner
alaska
acting
to
it,
department
of
environmental
conservation.
the
question
presented,
may
epa
order
construction
stopped
on
a
facility
when
epa
finds
that
the
state
permit
issuing
authority,
here,
alaska’s
environmental
department,
has
unreasonably
determined
what
si
the
best
available
technology,
the
bact,
for
that
facility.
in
december
1999,
the
alaska
department
issued
a
permit
allowing
increase
production
at
the
red
dog
mine,
a
zinc
mine
in
northwest
alaska.
the
permit
authorized
additional
generative
capacity.
as
the
best
available
technology
or
bact,
the
alaska
agency
first
suggested
a
method
found
technically
and
economically
feasible
that
would
reduce
emissions
from
the
new
installation
by
90%.
in
the
permit
given
red
dog
however,
the
alaska
agency
selected
as
bact
a
different
cheaper
technology,
one
that
would
reduce
emissions
by
only
30%.
in
justification
of
that
choice,
the
alaska
department
said
that
red
dog’s
operation
and
competitiveness
would
suffer
where
the
mine
forced
to
use
a
more
expensive
technology.
the
alaska
agency
acknowledged
however,
that
it
could
reach
no
judgment
on
the
economic
factors
it
was
to
take
into
account
because
the
mine
had
refused
to
provide
the
state
agency
with
relevant
financial
data.
epa
found
that
the
state
agency’s
choice
of
emission
control
technology
lacked
evidentiary
support
and
was
therefore,
unreasonable.
invoking
its
statutory
enforcement
authority,
epa
ordered
the
red
dog
operators
to
stop
construction
of
the
additional
generator
at
the
mine.
the
state
agency
contested
both
epa’s
authority
to
issue
stop
construction
orders
in
general,
and
epa’s
determination
in
this
case,
that
the
alaska
department’s
choice
of
emission
control
technology
was
unreasonable.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
both
upheld
the
federal
agency’s
assertion
of
supervisory
authority
generally
and
concluded
in
this
case
that
epa
had
legitimately
exercised
its
authority
when
it
ordered
the
red
dog
mine
to
stop
construction.
we
affirm
the
ninth
circuit’s
judgment.
the
act
does
not
give
state
permit
issuing
authorities
untethered
discretion,
rather
it
confines
the
state
agency’s
choices
by
directing
that
an
emission
control
technology
selected
as
bact
must
yield
the
maximum
achievable
reduction
in
pollutants
taking
account
of
practical
considerations
listed
in
the
statute.
for
reasons
detailed
in
the
court’s
opinion,
we
find
the
federal
agency’s
reading
of
the
act
fitting
and
proper.
we
therefore,
hold
that
epa
can
exercise
its
supervisory
power
to
block
a
facility's
construction
when
a
state
permit
issuing
authority
makes
a
bact
determination
untethered
to
the
clean
air
act's
guide
and
the
administrative
record.
we
further
conclude
that
epa
properly
exercised
its
authority
when
it
stopped
construction
at
the
red
dog
mine.
as
epa
found,
the
alaska
department’s
own
records
showed
that
there
was
scant
of
any
evidentiary
basis
for
choosing
the
less
stringent
emission
reduction
technology.
it
remains
open
to
the
alaska
agency
however,
if
that
agency
elects,
to
revisit
the
matter
and
to
establish
in
the
renewed
proceedings
a
satisfactory
evidentiary
basis
for
its
bact
determination.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
thomas
joined.
