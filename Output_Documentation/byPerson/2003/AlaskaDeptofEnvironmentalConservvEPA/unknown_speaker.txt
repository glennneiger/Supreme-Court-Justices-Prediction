unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
the
statute
allows
epa
to
at
least
say,
alaska,
you
didn't
go
through
the
proper
analysis
here,
you
didn't
consider,
as
contemplated
by
the
statute,
some
of
the
costs
and
concerns
that
would
enable
a
state
to
say,
fine,
you
go
ahead
with
less
than
the
ultimate
equipment?
now,
can
epa,
under
the
statute,
say,
alaska,
you
just
didn't
follow
the
required
procedures?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
an
element
here
in
fact?
wasn't
that
part
of
epa's
concern?
is
it
true
that
the
owner
of
the
mine
wouldn't
even
furnish
certain
financial
information
to
enable
the
state
to
make
that
analysis?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a...
that's
a
pretty
fine
line.
i
mean,
i'm...
i'm
really
surprised
by...
by
your
concession.
i...
i
would
have
thought
a
much
more
rational
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that,
yes,
the
state
has
certain
obligations
under
the
statute
to
consider
the
factors,
but
if
they
were
not
considered,
the
person
who
would
bring
them
to
account
for
not
considering
them
is
initially
the
state
courts
and
then,
on
certiorari,
to
this
court.
i
thought
your
position
was
that
this
is
none
of
epa's
business--
unknown
speaker
--that
this...
that
this
discretionary
determination
is
given
to
the
states,
and
when
the
states
are
reviewed,
they
should
be
reviewed
in
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
it
for...
for
the...
for
the
hypothetical
that
justice
o'connor
gives
as
well
as
for
everything
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
assuming
they
weren't
followed,
is
your
position
that
when
they
are
not
followed,
epa
can
call
them
to
account?
unknown
speaker
well,
let...
let
me
intervene
and...
and
suggest
this.
could
you
have
answered
justice
o'connor's
question
this
way?
oh,
yes,
the
epa
can...
can
complain
and
make
its
case
that
the
state
did
not
exercise
its
discretion
the
right
way,
but
it
can't
do
so
by
just
issuing
an
order.
it
has
to
go
through
the
judicial
review
process.
would...
would
that...
would
that
answer
your
case
or--
unknown
speaker
--or
am
i
misstating
the
theory
here?
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
could...
could
the
epa
have
gone
to
federal
court
and
say,
oh,
well,
this
discretion
was
exercised
in
good
faith
and
so
forth,
but
it
was...
it
was
wrong?
it
didn't
comply
with
the
statute.
could
it
go
to
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
in...
in
this
case...
in
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--as
justice
o'connor
said,
it
didn't
give...
oh,
it
cannot
go
to
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
it?
why
couldn't
it?
they
simply
proceed
under
28
u.s.c.
1345.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
they
do
is
they
say,
we're
now
in
federal
court.
there's
a
state
law
here.
the
state
law
happens
to
say
that
you
cannot
be
arbitrary.
unknown
speaker
and
so
now
they
say,
we're
making
the
same
claim
identically.
they
were
arbitrary,
capricious,
abuse
of
discretion.
but
it's
under
state
law.
and
now,
my
goodness,
what
is
this
case
about?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
they
should
have
gone
into
the
ninth
circuit
under
1345
arguing
it
was
arbitrary,
capricious
under
state
law,
and
they
say
that
they
should
be
in
the
ninth
circuit
arguing
that
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
federal
law,
where
i've
never
heard
that
there's
any
difference
between
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
state
law
or
under
federal
law.
it's
just
whether
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious.
unknown
speaker
they
do
go
into
federal
court,
and
i
do
see
your
point.
what
i
am
curious
about
is
i
think
there
are
like
maybe
a
handful
of
administrative
law
experts
who
might
have
thought
there
was
really
some
kind
of
difference
between
whether
you're
in
federal
court
under
the
state
words
or
in
federal
court
under
the
federal
words
when
the
words
are
identical.
and
there
may
be
somebody
who
thinks
there's
a
difference
between
what
you
told
justice
o'connor
and
what
you've
told
justice
scalia,
but
i'm
not
one
of
them.
i
don't
understand
how
you
reconcile
those
things.
so
if
we
assume
congress
is
not
an
expert,
why
wouldn't
they
have
just
meant
by
this,
well,
epa,
you
stay
out
of
it
unless
you
think
what
they're
doing
is
unreasonable?
if
what
you
think
they're
doing
is
unreasonable,
you
have
the
authority
to
come
in
and
go
to
federal
court
if
you
want.
that
would
be
simple.
everybody
would
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
franklin--
unknown
speaker
--perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
brief,
but
i
thought
that
you
were
making
the
distinction
in
your
brief
between
the
substance
of
a
decision
and
the
procedural
motions.
i
thought
you
conceded
that
if
the
alaska
agency
simply
said,
well,
the
company
wants
low
nox,
so
they're
going
to
get
it,
and
we're
not
going
to
go
through
any
feasibility
analysis.
i
thought
your
brief
conceded
that
if
that
were
the
case,
there
would
be
access
to
the
federal
court
on
the
part
of
epa.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
it,
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
when
the
epa
is
saying,
in
essence,
you
didn't
really
go
through
the
feasibility
analysis
because
you
didn't
even
ask
for
the
relevant
information?
unknown
speaker
so
you
want--
--mr.
franklin,
it's
not
just
a
question
of
coming
into
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
just
a
question
of
the
agency
coming
into
federal
court
the
way
a
private
citizen
would
and
challenging
the
state
action.
it's
a
matter
of
the
agency
issuing
an
order--
unknown
speaker
--which
order
is
presumptively
valid
and
which
would
have
to
be
deferred
to
by
the
federal
court
presumably
unless
the
order
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
unknown
speaker
so
you'd
be
deciding
in
federal
court
whether
it
was
arbitrary
or
capricious
for
epa
to
find
the
state
to
have
been
arbitrary
or
capricious,
a
very...
a
very
refined
determination,
to
put
it
mildly.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
the
problem?
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
getting
into
federal
court.
it's
a
matter
of
how
you
get
into
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is.
there's
a
difference
because
you're...
you
said
that
the
review...
the
reviewing
authority
would
be
the
state
court.
so
you
aren't
talking
about
whether
there
would
be
federal
court
review,
and
i
think
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
now
you
are
saying
that
the
route
is
the
state
court.
you're
agreeing
with
him
when
he
said
the
route
is
the
state
court
and
this
court
on
cert.
do
you
see
any
role
for
the
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
action
has
to
properly
lie
in
order
for
it
to
be
successful,
and
when
you
have...
on
what
basis
would
the
agency
be
suing?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
they
could
do
it.
suppose
that
the...
a
state
agency
decides
the
best
available
control
technology
is
a
ceiling
fan
that
they
brought
up
to
new
orleans...
from
new
orleans.
they
bought
it
and
brought
it
up
to
alaska.
now,
epa
looks
at
that
and
says,
no,
no,
this
is
going
too
far.
now,
what
in
your
opinion
is
supposed
to
happen?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
role
of
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
anyway
because
the
statute
that
we're
looking
at,
section
113(a)(5)
says
that
if
epa
finds
a
state
is
not
acting
in
compliance
with
any
requirement
or
prohibition
of
the
psd
program--
unknown
speaker
--epa
can
stop
construction
and
issue
orders.
it
can
also
bring
a
civil
suit
for
injunctive
or
monetary
relief.
suppose
it
just
puts
out
an
order
and
says,
look,
alaska,
you
did
not
determine
what
costs
would
mean
to
the
mine
in
terms
of
profitability,
employment,
or
global
competitiveness,
and
therefore
you
didn't
meet
the
requirements
of
the
psd
statute,
and
you
stop
any
construction
now
on
the
mine
expansion.
that
would
put
the
onus
on
the
mine
owner
or
the
state
to
go
to
court
somewhere,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
franklin--
--so
under
17...
or
what
is
it...
7413(a)(5)(c),
which
is
14a
of
your
brief
toward
the
bottom,
you
say
that
in
this
case
the
agency
cannot
invoke
that
section
to
issue
an
order
or
to
go
to
court.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
you
have
to
say
that
to
be
consistent.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
you
want
us
to
write
the
opinion
your
way,
you
would
say
under
17...
7413(a)(5),
the
state...
the
epa
cannot
issue
an
order
barring
construction
unless.
now
you
fill
in
the
blank.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--unless
there's
a
violation
of
an
express
statutory
requirement,
but
the
government
is
going
to
come
up
and
say,
there
was
a...
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
defining
bact.
unknown
speaker
what
your
formulation
is,
is
that
they
did
not
follow
a
requirement
of
the
statute.
and
i
just
don't
see
how
that
gets
you
there.
you're
making
a
distinction
between
the
express
requirements
of
the
statute
and
the
obviously
implicit
requirements
of
the
statute?
certainly
it...
it
is
implicit
in
the
statute
that
the
state's
decision
must
be
made
rationally
and
not
arbitrarily.
don't
you
think
that
that's
a
requirement
of
law?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
isn't
going
to
get...
the
reason
i
think
we're...
i'm
having
the
same
trouble
justice
scalia
is
because
the
kind
of...
in
my
mind
anyway,
i
tend
to
think
of
a
classical
definition
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
as
sometimes
involving
they
didn't
follow
what
the
statute
told
them
to
do.
sometimes
they
did
what
the
statute
told
them
not
to
do.
sometimes
they
didn't
get
the
weight
right.
and
i
put
all
those
things...
and
i
think
a
lot
of
people
do...
in
the
same
box
called
arbitrary
and
unreasonable,
capricious,
and
you
try
to
draw
some
kind
of
line
between
those
things.
i
don't
know
how
to
do
it,
and
i
don't
think
many
judges
would.
unknown
speaker
where
is--
--but
the
language
of
113(a)(5)
doesn't
really
seem
to
be
limiting...
i'm
over
here.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
limiting
the
authority
of
epa.
and
i'm
just
wondering
just...
i'm
not
sure
i
totally
follow
the
argument,
but
i'm
just
looking
at
the...
that
statutory
provision.
and
are
you
saying
that
statutory
provision
does
not
apply
even
if
the
state
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this...
that
provision
gives
the...
the
epa
the
authority
to
issue
certain
orders.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
your
position
that
they
did
not
have
the
authority
to
issue
the
order
here
or
that
the
order
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
even
if
there
were
a
violation
of
the
requirements
of
the
act,
would
you
say
they...
if...
if
there
were
a
violation
of
the
act,
would
they
have
the
authority
to
issue
it...
issue
that
order?
unknown
speaker
that's
in
advance
of
the
permit.
the
fact
that...
that
congress
specified
that
for
certain
pollutions,
you
must,
before
you
give
any
permit,
go
to
the
epa
doesn't
exclude
that
you
could
have
the
review
after.
but
i
would...
after
the
permit
issues.
but
i
would
like
to
ask
you.
you
seem
to
be
saying,
well,
this
is
just
a
determination.
they
applied
the
statutory
factors.
epa
didn't
like
the
way
they
did
it.
there
seems
to
be
lurking
in
this
a...
a
difference
on
what
the
statute
means
to
this
extent.
epa
seems
to
be
taking
a
single
source
approach.
that
is,
you
want
a
new
generator?
that
generator
has
to
have
bact
for
that
generator.
never
mind
if
you
tell
us
voluntarily
you're
going
to
put
low
nox
on
all
of
them
and
the
result
would
be
lowering
the
emissions.
in
other
words,
epa
seems
to
be
taking
a
no-bubble
approach
to
this.
you
go
at
it
machine
by
machine--
unknown
speaker
--generator
by
generator,
where
you're
taking
the
position
or
alaska
is
taking
the
position
that
if
you
can
reduce
overall
emissions
by
putting
the
low
nox
on
all
six
generators
and
in
the
end
have
cleaner
air,
well,
then
do
that
and
forget
about
the
scr
on
one
machine.
that
seems
to
be
a
substantive
difference
about
whether
bact
applies
to
the
whole
setup
or
machine...
generator
by
generator.
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
it's
either
that
you
go
at
it
machine...
source
by
source,
new
source
by
new
source,
modification
by
modification,
or
you
can
have
the
bubble
concept.
in
chevron,
epa
was...
was
espousing
the
bubble
concept
and
the
court...
this
court
said,
epa,
that's
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute.
now
epa
seems
to
be
saying
as
to
this
program
there
is
no
bubble.
you
have
to
look
at
that
machine,
that
generator
in
isolation.
unknown
speaker
and
that
seems
to
be
a
basic
difference
on
what
the
statute
means,
not
on...
mix
it
all
up
and
is
it
arbitrary
and
capricious.
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
facts
here
i
thought...
now,
tell
me
if
i'm
right
about
this.
when
i
started
reading
it,
i
was
quite
sympathetic
to
your
view
that
it
makes
no
sense
to
have
more
emissions
coming
out
as
a
result
of
trying
to
control
this
one
generator.
their
job
is
to
get
fewer
emissions
not
more.
but
then
when
i
read
into
the
record
a
little
bit,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
facts
are
that
by
the
time
this
generator
17
came
up,
it
was
perfectly
apparent
that
the
company
had
to
put
the...
whatever,
some
low
technology,
nox
technology
or
something
on
four
of
the
other
generators
anyway.
so
that
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
bubble
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
because
we're
talking
about
one
generator
coming
in
in
circumstances
where
the
other
generators
have
to
be
controlled
regardless.
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
then
we...
i
had
my
law
clerk
go
through
and
do
the
extra
emissions
from
those
other
two,
and
it
didn't
really
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
it
does?
unknown
speaker
if
i
go--
--i
still
don't...
i
don't...
i
don't
see
where
justice
breyer's
question
fits
with...
with
the
issue,
does
the
statute
dictate
bact
on
an
individual
generator?
never
mind
the
rest.
in
other
words,
does
the
act
say,
no
bubble,
and
that's
how
epa
seems
to
be
reading
the
act,
that
it's
not
a
matter
of
discretion,
that
this
calls
for
a
new
source,
modified
source,
and
you
just
look
at
that
new
source
and
you
don't
look
at
the
old
generators
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
other
method
is
there
besides
the
top-down?
i
know
both
briefs
have
said
it's...
it's
the
way
it
was
done
here.
that's
what
epa
recommends,
but
it
isn't
inevitable.
what
else
would
they
use
other
than
top-down?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
fact
the
situation,
that
there
are
other
ways,
or
is
it
just
in
theory,
but
they
all
use
top-down?
unknown
speaker
mr....
mr.
franklin,
the...
the
difficulty
that
i'm
having
with...
with
your
argument
about
the
meaning
of
the
statute
goes
back
to
your
answer
i
think
to
justice
kennedy's
question
awhile
ago.
he
asked
you,
in
effect,
what's
the
role
of
the
statute
on
your
theory,
and...
and
you
said,
well,
if
they...
if
they
simply
ignore
one
of
the
stated
statutory
factors,
they
say
we're
not
going
to
consider
this,
or
if
there's
a
technical
defect
in
the
order,
if
the
order
is
incomplete,
that
would
be
a...
a
circumstance
in
which
epa
could
exercise
this
authority.
but
you
also
said...
and
i...
i
assume
you
said
correctly...
that
later
on
that
these
kinds
of
obvious
violations
are
going
to
be
rare.
unknown
speaker
and
that
leads
me
back
to...
as
i
said,
i
guess,
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
and
that
is
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
your
view
of
the...
the
two
statutory
sections,
there
really
isn't
very
much
role
for
them
to
play,
and
i
can't
imagine
why
congress
would
have
enacted
separate
order
sections
if
all
they
were
meant
to
do
is
what
you
say.
so
my
question
is,
why...
why
doesn't
your
explanation
trivialize
these
two
statutes
to
a
point
that
is
implausible?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
epa
could
do
the
same
thing
by
following
the
state
review
process,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
could
go
in
and
say,
look,
they
forgot
x.
they
refused
to
apply
y.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
question.
i
mean,
the...
the
difficulty
i'm
having
is
that
if...
if
it
is
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
provided
this
entire
separate
track
simply
to
deal
with
the
problems
that
you
say
the
track
is
meant
to
deal
with,
then
it
is
not
so
implausible
at
all
that
congress
would
have
intended
the
statute
to
be
applied
as
it
has
been
applied
here.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
franklin.
mr.
hungar,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
he
is...
i
mean,
my
impression
of
their
argument
was,
yes,
you
can
review
that.
what
you
have
go
is
through
the
state
procedure
and
then
after
you
go
through
the
state
procedures,
in
fact,
you
can
go
into
a
federal
court
and
have
them
apply
the
state
review
procedure
if
you
want.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
what
their
argument
was,
or
at
least
one
of
their
arguments.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
different
thing.
maybe
yours
is
better,
but
you
can't
say
they're
leaving
it
without
review.
so
i
just
wanted
to--
unknown
speaker
--that's
begging...
i
mean,
that...
that
is
exactly
the
point
at
issue,
it
seems
to
me.
why
is...
why
is
it
irrational
to
envision
a
scheme
such
as...
such
as
the
petitioners
here
propose,
which
is,
look
it,
congress
set
certain,
absolute
requirements?
ambient
air
quality,
you
know,
shall
be
this.
but
as
long
as
those
requirements
are
met,
below
that
we
also
want
each
state...
each
emission
source
in
a
state
to
be
examined
to
see
whether
it
is
using
the
best
available
technology.
but
what
constitutes
the
best
available
technology
under
the
circumstances
is
a
very
difficult
question.
it
involves
issues
of...
of
the
state
economy,
as
well
as
scientific
issues.
we
are
content
so
long
as
each
state
meets
the
absolute
standards
that
the
statute
sets
forth.
below
that
standard,
we're
going
to
let
each
state
decide
whether
the
best
available
technology
under
all
the
circumstances
is
being
used.
that
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
sensible
and
rational
system.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
see
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
but
you're...
you're
missing
the...
the
first
part
of
it.
it
doesn't
say
which
is
the
best
available.
it
says
the
best
of
means
and
emission
limitation,
best
on
the
maximum
degree
of
production
of
each
pollutant
subject
to
regulation
under
this
chapter,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
which
the
permitting
authority
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
taking
into
account
these
various
methods,
determines
to
be
the
bact.
i
mean,
there
it
is.
which
the
permitting
authority
determines.
unknown
speaker
but
they're...
they're
not
saying--
unknown
speaker
--they're
not
saying
that
the
discretion
is
unreviewable.
they're
just
saying
it's
reviewable
in
a
different
manner
than
you
think
it
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
federal...
are
you
aware
of
any
state
in
the
united
states
that
does
not
have
in
its
law
the
requirement
that
its
own
agencies
have
to
act
rationally,
that
they
can't
arbitrarily,
abuse
of
discretion?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
either.
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
seems
to
be
the
same
standard
that
you
argue
that
applies,
and
since
there
is
no
state
that
doesn't
have
that
standard
and
no
federal
government
that
doesn't
have
it,
we
all
have
the
same
standard.
and
that's
why
i
think
the
argument
does
boil
down
to
which
courts
will
apply
it:
the
federal
court
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
or
the
federal
court
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
range
of
judgment.
this
is
the
only
provision
that
reads
this
categorically.
i...
i...
which
the
permitting
authority
on
a
case-by-case
basis
determines.
unknown
speaker
tell
me
again
where...
where--
unknown
speaker
--on
13a.
unknown
speaker
(4).
right?
unknown
speaker
(j).
unknown
speaker
well,
could...
could
we
get
specific
in
this
case?
looking
at
the
clean
air
act
provision,
169(3),
which
the
permitting
authority
on
a
case-by-case
basis
determines
is
achievable,
after
considering
economic
impacts
and
other
costs.
now,
epa
says
what's
wrong.
alaska
did
make
a
determination,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
so?
let...
looking
at
the
statute,
what
provision
did
they
fail
to
comply
with?
unknown
speaker
what's
wrong...
what's
wrong
with
that?
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let
me
just
ask
you--
unknown
speaker
--a
technical
point.
suppose
at
the
end
of
the
day...
and
i'm
not
sure
if
this
is
what
we
would
do
or
that
i
would
favor,
but
suppose
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
agree
epa
had
authority
to
issue
a
stop
order
and
that
it
was
proper.
could
alaska
then
go
back
and
say,
well,
okay,
we're
going
to
run
through
this
drill
once
more
and
do
consideration
of
costs,
and
they're
now
going
to
allow
low
nox's
instead
based
on
that?
now,
can
they
do
that?
is
that
all
right?
unknown
speaker
so
this
wouldn't
be
the
end
of
the
day.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me,
mr.
hungar--
--speaking
of
it's
appropriate--
--can
you
tell
me,
mr.
hungar,
whether
or
not
as...
as
a
matter
of
past
practice,
the
epa
has
intervened
in
any
state
administrative
review
proceedings
in
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
has...
has
it
gone
to
federal
court
under...
was
it...
1345,
the
united
states
district?
unknown
speaker
so
the
epa
has
been
consistent
in
saying
that
it...
it
is
not
in
any
case
like
this
or
with
parallels
to
this
gone
through
an
administrative
process.
it's
simply
issued
a
stop
order?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
surprise
me.
you...
you
mention
on
an
appropriate
record.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
makes
me
uneasy
about
the...
the
resolution
that
you
propose.
when
this
thing
comes
to
a
federal
court
of
appeals,
which
is
not
a
fact-finding
court,
it
comes
on
the
basis
of
nothing
except
epa's
order.
we...
we
do
not
know
the
record
before
the
administrative
agency
on
the
basis
of
which
the
epa
acted.
now,
if
you
had
gone
through
the
state
administrative
procedure,
that
record
would
have
been
examined.
that
would...
the
action
in
question
would
have
been
the
action
of
the
state
agency
and...
and
you
would
examine
the
record
before
the
state
agency.
but...
but
the
administrative
action
we're
reviewing
here
is
not
the
state
administrative
action.
it's
your
administrative
action,
and
the
only
relevant
record
is
the
record
before
the
epa.
and...
and
as
i
said
before,
the
court
of
appeals
ends
up
determining
whether
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
the
epa
to
determine
that
the
state
agency
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
you
combine
those
two
weird
factors
and...
and
i'm
just
dubious
that
this
is
the
kind
of
review
that
congress
intended.
unknown
speaker
square.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
it's
a
question
of
judgment
and
whose
judgment
gets
some
weight.
in
respect
to
that,
what
i'd
really
suddenly
stirred
up
again
here...
suppose
we
reach
the
second
question.
suppose
we
reach
the
question
of
whether
alaska
did,
in
fact,
do
something
that
was
pretty
unreasonable,
and
suppose
i
accept
your
argument
that
this
was
totally
unreasonable
to
say
that
they
didn't
have
to
put
in
this
special
technology
because
of
cost
when
alaska
didn't
even
know
what
the
cost
was.
that's
about
like
the
fan.
that's
close
to
the
ceiling
fan.
that's
what
you're
arguing.
but
then
they've
made
another
argument,
and
the
other
argument
is
bothering
me
a
lot
more.
and
that
is
that
the
epa
has
taken
the
position
that
you
have
to
put
this
extra
special
converter
or
whatever
on
number
17,
even
if
the
consequence
of
that,
because
of
the
interaction
of
the
regs
and
their
desires
with
number
2
and
number
6,
is
more
pollution.
now,
that
does
bother
me
because
it
seems
to
me
a
state
agency
that's
trying
to
get
a
result
that
is
less
polluting
is
not
acting
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
except
in
rather
unusual
circumstances.
now,
what
do
i
do
with
that
argument?
does
that
mean
if
i
accept
everything
you
say...
but
that
worries
me...
i
should
send
it
back
for
another
determination
of
whether
this
really
is
arbitrary
and
capricious?
what
should
i
do
with
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
that's
a...
that's
one
point.
i've
got
that
point.
that's
a
kind
of
technical
point
in
my
mind.
in
other
words,
alaska
might
really
be
polluting
more,
but
because
of
this
sort
of
which
paper
they
wrote
which
in,
we
should
just
accept
it.
now,
i
got
that
argument.
but
is
there
any
other?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
asked
that
question
before.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
it
is
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
text
of
this
statute.
i
thought
that
epa
was
taking
an
anti-bubble
approach,
that
it
said,
you
want
to
have
generator
17.
we
look
at
generator
17
and
that's
what
the
statute
means
by
new
source.
i
thought
you
were
taking
that
view,
but
maybe
you're
not.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
so
it
isn't
a
question
of
just
loose,
arbitrary,
and
capricious.
epa
is
taking
the
position
that
you
look
at
generator
17
because
you've
already
made
the
determination
that
adding
a
generator,
modifying
another
one,
is
going
to
add
to
the
pollution.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hungar,
can
i
ask
you,
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
earlier,
is
there
a
significant
difference
in
the
record
before
us
in
this
proceeding
than
what
the
record
would
contain
if
they
had
followed
the
route
of
applying
a
review
of
the
alaska
order
through
the
state
system?
unknown
speaker
because
my
impression,
the
record
really
was
the
same
no
matter
which
way
you
went.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
they...
did
they
put
in
the
whole
state
record--
unknown
speaker
--before
the
state
agency?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any...
i
take
your
answer
is
they
can
put
in
the
entire
state
record
to
go
before
the
court
of
appeals.
is
that
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
it
goes
back
to
a
question
that
has
now
dropped
out
of
the
case
entirely
it
seems.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think
epa
was
arguing
this
is
not
a
final
order.
you
have
to
wait
until
we
go
into
court
and
the
court
that
we
would
go
into
is
a
district
court
where
a
full
record
could
be
developed.
i
take
it
you
have
now
abandoned
that
argument
and
seen
the
error
of
your
ways,
and
now
you
accept
that
this
is
final.
what
led
you
to
change?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hungar,
you...
you've
just
told
us
that
the
reviewing
court
can
have
the
full
state
record
before
it
when
it
makes
its
determination.
what
about
epa
when
it
makes
its
determination,
when
it
issues
its
order?
what...
what
does
it
have
in
front
of
it?
it
doesn't
have
to
have
anything,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
have
to
do
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
presented
to
the
agency,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
did
it
in
this
case?
is
that...
is
that
what
it
did?
did
it
review
the
agency
record
here?
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me?
i
want
to
be
very
clear
on
what
i
didn't
hear
in
answer
to
my
question.
what
i
was
concerned
about...
and
i
understand
your
legal
arguments,
but
i
was
concerned
about
their
claim.
if
you
win
this
case,
what
it
means
is
more
expensive
technology
goes
onto
number
17.
they
run
number
17
less.
they
run
2
and
6
more,
and
the
net
result
in
alaska
is
more
pollution.
now,
you
haven't
said...
i
haven't
heard
you
say,
no,
that's
wrong.
what
you
have
said
is
we
shouldn't
reach
it.
there...
there...
they
didn't
make
the
claim
in
the
right
place
with
the
right
words.
and
i
want
to
give
you
a
chance
to
say,
no,
that's
wrong,
if
it
is
wrong.
unknown
speaker
so,
do
i...
i
understand
you
to
say
that
they
would
be
forced...
i
take
it
you're...
implicitly
you're
saying
they'd
be
forced
to
use
this
generator
because
the
use
of
this
generator
would
be
the
only
way
that
they,
in
fact,
could
comply
with
the
cap?
unknown
speaker
for--
unknown
speaker
--for
this...
all
seven.
okay.
unknown
speaker
the
cap...
the
cap
wouldn't
be
lower.
the
total
emissions
would
be
lower.
the
cap
would--
unknown
speaker
--so...
so
the
answer
is
it
would
probably...
most
probably
use
the
new
generator.
unknown
speaker
theoretically
it
wouldn't
have
to.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
franklin,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
ask
if
it
was...
could
remand
it.
i
asked
whether
it
would
be
open
to
the
state
to
go
through
the
drill
that
epa
said
it
didn't
do
before
and
that
the
state
said
it
didn't
have
the
information
to
enable
it
to
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
courts...
there
are
courts
with
doctrines
that
would
not
allow
such
inequitable
conduct.
i
mean,
you
brought
up
it
could
be
years
and
years
later;
anytime,
17
years
later,
epa
could
wake
up.
the
answer
to
that
was
that
no
court
would
give
an
ear
to
epa
having
just
slept
on--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
situation.
