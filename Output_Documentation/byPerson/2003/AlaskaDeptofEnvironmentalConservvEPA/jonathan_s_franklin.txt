mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
environmental
protection
agency
has
the
legal
authority
to
override
by
fiat
a
discretionary
determination
that
congress
expressly
directed
be
made
instead
by
the
state
of
alaska,
which
congress
trusted
to
exercise
its
own
independent
judgment
according
to
local
priorities
and
local
conditions.
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
when
congress
wanted
to
give
epa
the
authority
to...
under
the
clean
air
act
to
review
and
approve
the
substance
of
individual
state
determinations
of
the
best
available
control
technology,
or
bact,
congress
said
so
expressly.
it
gave
epa
no
such
role
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
epa
can
say,
yes,
alaska,
you
did
not
consider
the
statutory
factors,
but
that
is
not
the
contention
that's
being
made
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
two
points,
your
honor.
the
contention
that's
being
made
here
is
not
that
alaska
failed
to
consider
the
factors
that
congress
set
forth.
the
contention
is
that
they
didn't
do
it
in
the
way
that...
that
epa
might
have
done
it
if
epa
were
the
permitting
authority
with
regard--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--it
is
our--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--that
is
our...
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
think
that
the...
the
line
is
whether
the
requirements
of
the
statute
were
followed
or
not.
in
this
case,
alaska
has
done
precisely
that
which
it--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--epa
has
the
authority
to
enforce
the
requirements
and
prohibitions
of
the
act,
but
we
believe
that
authority
should
be
narrowly
circumscribed
to
the
bounds
that
congress
set
for
the
epa.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no,
you're
not,
your
honor.
the...
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
claims
that
epa
raises
here
will
be
subject
to
review.
the
question
is
how,
when,
and
in
what
manner,
and--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--if
it's
contention
is
it
didn't
comply
with
the
express
terms
of
the
statute--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--in
this
case,
no.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
it
could
under
the
state
review
procedure,
and
i
think
there's
an
open
question
as
to
whether--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--exactly.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
correct.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
exactly.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
there
are
two
important
differences,
your
honor,
and...
and
i
think
they
would
have...
1345
is
the
statute
i
was
just
about
to
cite,
and
i
think
they
would
have
the
authority
to
go
into
federal
court
under
state
law.
two
important
distinctions.
first,
your
honor,
the...
the...
going
through
the
state
process
would
require
that
they
go
through,
in
addition
to
the
state
judicial
review
process,
the
state
administrative
review
process.
in
alaska,
that
would
have
allowed
alaska's
department
of
environmental
conservation
a
de
novo
administrative
hearing
at
which
they
could
have
presented
a
full
administrative
record,
additional
witnesses,
and
they
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
further
clarify
and
defend
their
decision.
the
second
point,
your
honor,
is
that
under
the
fiat
that
they
have
exercised
here
by
order,
it
does
not
accord
alaska's
determination
the
kind
of
deference
that
it
would
have
received
under
the
state
process.
the
point
that
we're
making,
your
honor,
is
that
the
state
review
process
is
adequate
to
address
all
the
concerns--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--if
congress
had
made
that
clear
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
we
would
not
be
here.
the
reason
that
congress
did
not
is
that
when
congress
wanted
to
give
epa
the
authority
to
review
and
approve
the
substance
of
individual
state
bact
determinations,
it
said
so
expressly
in
section
7475--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
here
about
today.
what
we
are
here
about
today
is
epa--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--to
get
back
to
that,
your
honor,
the...
what
epa
is
saying
is
that
we
did
go
through
the
factors,
but
we
didn't
weigh
them
the
way
epa
would.
and
with
respect
to
the
economic
considerations,
your
honor,
alaska
has
followed
epa's
own
guidance
on
this
which
says
quite
clearly
that
the
individual
circumstances
and
finances
of
a
permit...
an
applicant
are
not
to
be
considered
in
the
analysis.
so
it
was
not
relevant
whether
the
technology
would
have
bankrupted
this
company
or
not.
what
alaska
found
to
be
relevant
and
what
it
was
its
statutory
prerogative
to
find
relevant
and
as
a
matter
of
its
own
local
priorities
was
a
comparison
of
the
costs
between
this
applicant
and
other
similarly
situated
applicants
in
recent
decisions.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
exactly.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
and
that
is
what
i
was--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--exactly.
as
i
was
saying
before,
it's
not
a
question
of...
of
whether
these
things
will
be
reviewed
but
how,
and
more
specifically,
whether
these
issues
which
are--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
it's
an
open
question.
we
believe
that
the
federal
courts...
if
epa
were
instituting
this,
the
state
review
procedure,
under
section...
28
u.s.c.,
section
1345,
there
may
be
federal
jurisdiction
because
that
confers
original
federal
jurisdiction
on
any
action
brought
by
a
federal
agency.
but
that's
a
narrow,
limited
scope.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
they
would
be
suing
under
the
state
review
procedure,
your
honor.
it
would
be
their
option
we
think,
and
it's
an
open
question.
it's
not
one
that
i
think
this
court--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
in...
in
our
opinion
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
it
would
be
subject
to
the
apa-type
review
and
it
would
be
struck
down.
again,
the
question
is
not
whether
that
kind
of
review
of--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
if
epa
is
the
one
bringing
the
action,
i...
i
would
accept
your
honor's
premise
that
once
it
has
proceeded
through
the
comment
process,
once
it
has
proceeded
through
the
administrative
review
process...
and
frankly,
we
think
that
that
particular
matter
would
end
there.
no
state
would
do
that
because
the
states
take
their
responsibilities
seriously
to
implement
these
statutes.
if,
however,
there
were
any
question
that
remained
at
the
end
of
that
process,
which
epa
circumvented
in
this
case
by
fiat,
then
and
only
in
that
event
would
epa
be
able
to
seek
judicial
review,
but
it
would
be
an
apa
case.
it
would
not
be--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it
would
and...
and
that's
precisely
the
reversal
of
the
kind
of
presumption
of
regularity
that
the
states
are
entitled
to
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
unless
a
state
has...
if
there
was
a
demonstrated
violation
of
an
express
statutory
requirement.
for
example,
a
state
has
not--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--issued
a
permit
to
begin
with
or
a
state
has
not
put
a
bact
limitation
into
a
permit.
those
are
the
kind--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--but
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
is
not
with
respect
to...
to
the
epa,
that's
not
what
they're
saying.
they're
saying
that
we
did
go
through
the
various
factors
that
the
bact
statute
requires
us
to
go
through.
in
their
opinion
we
didn't
weigh
them
the
proper
way
and
under
the
proper
policies.
we,
in
fact,
disagree
strongly
with
that,
but
that
is
a
contention
that
is
raised
every
day
of
the
week
under
administrative
procedure
law.
it's
not
a
contention
that
the
express
requirements
of
the
statute--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--it
is
certainly
a
requirement
of
law,
your
honor,
but
it
is
a
background
principle
that
derives
ultimately,
we
think,
from
the
due
process
clause
not
a
unstated
requirement
of
the
clean
air
act.
and
the
important
thing
is
what
did
congress
intend
for
epa
to
be
able
to--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
i
think
that
judges
would,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
usually
come
up
because
a
court,
reviewing
such
a
procedure,
could...
could
find
the...
the
order
invalid
under
either
basis,
either
it
didn't
comply
with
the
statute
or
it
didn't
comply
with
the
apa.
here,
though,
congress
specifically
circumscribed
the
epa's
authority
and
it
did
so
for
a
good
reason.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
the
statute
governs
how
the
agency's...
gives
the
agency
the
discretion.
how
the...
the
agency
exercises
that
discretion
is
a
separate
question
and
one
that
is
traditionally
reviewed
on
a
full
administrative
record
by
a
court,
not
by
epa
acting
on
its
own
fiat.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
our...
that
they
did
not
have
the
authority
because
there
was
not
a...
a
violation
of
the
requirements
of
the
act,
which
is
the
only
basis--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--if
there...
if
there
were
a
violation
of
the
express
requirements
of
the
act,
then...
then
that's
what
the
statute
says.
but
it
has
to
be
read
in
context.
it
has
to
be
read
in
context.
particularly
when
congress
wanted
to
give
epa
the
authority
to
review
and
approve
the
substance
of
these
determinations,
it
said
so
expressly
in
one
narrow
instance
that
is
not
applicable
here.
when
a
state
has--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes,
it
is,
and
we
believe
that
epa
is...
is
wrong
on
that.
but
they're
wrong
as
a
matter
of
policy,
your
honor.
the
bact
statute
gives
the
states
the
discretion
to
weigh,
among
other
factors,
environmental
factors.
we
think
that
is
clearly
broad
enough
for
the
state
to
take
into
consideration
the
overall
environmental
effect
that
this--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
we
think
that
it's...
in
fact,
there
is
a
difference
on...
on
how
it's
to
be
implemented.
congress
was
very
clear
here.
they
understood
that
states
would
have
different
policies,
that
one
state
could
choose
the
approach
that
epa
might
choose,
which
says
we
are
not
going
to
consider
the
environmental...
overall
environmental
impact
here.
another
state
might
view
it
differently,
but
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
have
happen.
when
epa
issued
its
orders
in
this
case--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--you're
almost
right,
your
honor,
but
the...
the
difference
is
that
there...
there
were
four
other
generators
that
were
subject
to
the
cap,
but
there
were
six
other
generators
total.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it
did...
it
does
make
a
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
because
of
the
assumption
that
alaska
made,
and
that
is
that
if
you
used
scr
on
mg-17...
and
this
has
never
been
challenged...
that...
that
mg-17
would
be
the
backup
generator.
it
would
not
be
used.
therefore,
any
emissions
savings
that
you
can
get
off
those
other
two
engines,
2
and
6,
no
matter
how
small
they
might
be...
and
i
think
that
they
probably
come
in
the
neighborhood
of
100
tons
or
so.
any
emissions
savings
that
you
can
get
off
2
and
6
add
to
the
bottom
line
because
the
assumption
that
the
state
has
made,
which
is
a...
a
reasonable
and
in
my
view
correct
assumption,
is
that
mg-17
is
not
going
to
be
used
if
it's
scr
because
scr
has
enormous
operating
costs
associated
with
it.
again,
these
were
the...
the
policy
determinations--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--you
look
at
the
new
source,
your
honor,
but
you're
allowed
to
consider
environmental
impact
in
looking
at
it.
and
there
epa
is
wrong,
if
that's
their
contention.
their...
for
example,
they...
they
do
not
require
states,
nor
could
they,
to
use
their
top-down
methodology.
epa
understands...
and
that
is
the
nub
of
this
case...
that
the
bact
determination
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
uniform
federal
standard.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it
could...
it
could
be
bottom-up,
your
honor.
they
could
look
at
each
technology
and
eliminate
the
ones
going
up.
there's
a
number
of
different
ways
that
a
state
could
do
it.
the
point
that's
being
made
here,
when
epa
issued--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
every
state
uses,
but
i
do
know
that
congress
made
clear...
and
the
legislative
history
at
page
31
of
the
senate
report
is
crystal
clear
on
this
point...
that
each
state
was
to
have
the
discretion
to
weigh
the
factors
in
its
own
judgment.
and...
and
congress
made
clear
that
a
state...
it
would
be
permissible
for
a
state
to
consider
such
things
as
anticipated
and
desired
economic
development,
as
well
as
the
amount
of
the
available
increment
that
the
state
wished
a
particular
source
to
consume.
when--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
they
don't
trivialize
it,
your
honor.
there
are
numerous
federal
requirements
that
if
a
state
does
not
meet
those
express
statutory
requirements,
then
epa
can
step
in.
there
are
ambient
air
quality
standards--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--it--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--but
if
its
contention
is
one
that
the
statute
gives
the
discretion
but
it
was
simply
not
exercised
in
the
proper
way
that
we
would
have
exercised
it,
that
is
not
a
contention
that
congress
wanted
epa
to
be
able
to
resolve
by
fiat.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
think
it
is
implausible
because
congress
made
clear
that
epa's
authority
was
circumscribed
to
enforcing
the...
the
statutory
requirements,
and
those
requirements
were
met
in
this
case.
if
i
might
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
thank
you,
your
honor.
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
colloquy
with
counsel
as
to
whether
epa
could
simply
remand
the
case
and
then
there
might
be
a
back
and
forth
that
could
take--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--and...
and
that
is
precisely
the
problem
in
our
view
because
epa,
if
the
court
upholds
its
authority
in
this
case,
can
act
by
fiat
at
any
time
it
wants
on
the
basis
of
any
information
that
it
deems
relevant,
even
after
a
permit
has
gone
through
the
entire
state
process,
even
after
it
has
become
final
under
state
law,
and
even
after
the
source
may
have
invested
millions
of
dollars
in
the
technology.
then
epa
could
step
in.
what
we
are
saying
here...
and,
justice
breyer,
we
don't
care
which
court--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--with
respect--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--with
respect,
your
honor,
epa's
enforcement
authority
in
this
case
is
mandatory.
under
section
167,
they
shall
take
appropriate
measures
to
stop
construction.
therefore,
if
the
court
upholds
their
authority
in
this
case,
they
have
to
exercise
it
at
any
point.
and,
justice
breyer,
we
don't
care
which
court
conducts
the
review.
we
care
that
a
court
does
and
not
epa
acting
at
any
time
by
fiat
according
to
any
information
that
it
may
have
at...
at...
on
the
basis
of
what
it
thinks
may
or
may
not
be
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
the
point
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
the
state
procedures
are
fully
adequate
to
address
any
concerns
that
epa
has
raised
here,
and
its
injecting
itself
into
the
process,
disrupting
the
orderly
process...
and,
justice
stevens,
the
record
would
be
different
and
it
would
be
different
because
alaska
law
allows,
when
a
party
has
properly
objected,
for
a
de
novo
administrative
hearing,
at
which
the
agency
is
allowed
to
present
additional
evidence,
witnesses,
and
further
refine
and
clarify
its
decision.
if
there
was
any
legitimate
concern
as
to
whether
the
state's
decision
wasn't
clear,
as
it
should
have
been,
that
is
the
manner
in
which
it
should
have
been
resolved,
through
the
administrative
process.
and
we
are
confident
that
it
would
have
been
resolved
there,
justice
o'connor.
that's
where
the
back
and
forth
would
have
occurred,
not
in
the
manner
of
here
where
we're
now
4
years
later
and
we
still
don't
have
a
decision
as
to
what
technology
this
company
can
use.
and
finally,
your
honors,
the...
the
point
of
the
matter
is
there's
no
legitimate
dispute
here
that
the
result
of
alaska's
decision
is
cleaner
air
and
that
cannot
be
unreasonable.
