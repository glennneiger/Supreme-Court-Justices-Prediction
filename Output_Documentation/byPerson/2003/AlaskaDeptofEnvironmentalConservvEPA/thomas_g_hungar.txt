mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
fundamental
contention
is
that
once
a
state
issues
a
determination
of
best
available
control
technology
so
labeled,
no
matter
how
arbitrary,
factually
unsupported,
or
unreasoned
it
may
be,
the
federal
government
has
no
enforcement
authority
under
the
act
to
take
actions
to
stop
the
invalid
permit
from
taking
effect.
nothing
in
the
text,
structure,
or
history
of
the
act
supports
the
implausible
contention
that
congress
intended
to
immunize
arbitrary,
unreasoned
state
decision
making
from
federal
enforcement
review.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but,
your
honor,
congress
enacted
a
federal
regulatory
scheme
and
a
federal
enforcement
scheme.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
review
only
under
state
law,
your
honor,
and...
and
our
point
is
that
congress
has
enacted
a
comprehensive
federal
regulatory
scheme
and
authorized
epa
to
serve
as
a
backstop
to
ensure
compliance
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
act,
or
this...
this
portion
of
the
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
the
definition
of
best
available
control
technology
does
not
simply
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
decision
maker,
the
unbridled
discretion,
to...
to
select
whatever
it
wants--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--it
imposes
meaningful
constraints,
your
honor.
maximum
emissions
reduction
that
is
achievable
taking
into
account
specified
factors.
a
failure,
for
example--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
two
responses.
number
one,
the...
the
united
states
code
is
filled
with
examples
of
instances
in
which
congress
defines
that
it's
the
initial
decision
maker
for
a
particular
question,
but
that
is
not
generally
taken
to
mean
that
delegation
of
absolute,
unreviewable
discretion.
number...
particularly
when,
as
here,
the
statute
imposes--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--these
constraints
on
the
decision
maker.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
they're
saying
that
it's
not
reviewable
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but
i
know
there--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
number
one,
i
believe
various
states
have
standing
requirements
that
may
be
more
restrictive
than
those
applicable
under...
under
federal
law.
number
two,
the
question
is
not
merely
which
court
will
apply
it
but
whether
the...
the
comprehensive
administrative
authority
confirmed
on
epa
to
issue
orders
and
not
just
the
administrative
orders
at
issue
here,
but
also
the
possibility
of
the...
of
the
administrative
sanctions
proceeding,
which
is
separately
provided
by
congress
in
subsection
(d)
of
7413.
under
petitioner's
interpretation,
none
of
that
would
apply
as
long
as
there's
some
element
of
discretion
in
the
state's
decision.
and
it's
simply
not
correct
to
say
that
bact
is
the
only
area
in
which
the
states
enjoy
some
range
of
judgment
or...
or
in
which
there
may
be
factual
disputes--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--with
respect,
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
under...
under
7475(a)(3),
which
is
the...
the
subparagraph
prior
to
(a)(4)
which
imposes
the
bact
requirement...
7475(a)(3)
is
on...
i
believe
it's
on
13a
of
the
appendix
to
the
gray
brief.
(a)(3)
is...
is
where
the...
is
where
the
requirement
that
permittees
meet
other
provisions
of
the
act
such
as
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
and
the
increments.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
7475(a)(3)
on...
on
13a
of
the
gray
brief
appendix.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
(4)
is
the
bact
requirement.
(3)
is
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards,
other
standards
of
performance,
the
increments,
and
so
forth.
all
of
the
other
requirements
that...
that
petitioner
concedes
epa
should
be
able
to
enforce.
but
if
you
turn...
and
that
(a)(3),
in
turn,
references
7410--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--(j).
7410(j),
which
is
on
page
5a
of
the
appendix,
says
that
the
permittee
must...
the
permit
applicant
must
demonstrate
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
permitting
agency
that
all
of
these
requirements
have
been
met.
so
under
petitioner's
interpretation,
epa's
authority
to
enforce
all
of...
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
prevention
of
significant
deterioration
program
would
be
eviscerated
to
the
extent
there
is
discretion
in
those
determinations
and
there
is
necessarily
discretion.
all
of
those
other
determinations
require
modeling,
and
to
do
modeling,
you
have
to
determine
what
the
inputs
to
the
model
are
and
you
have
to
determine
what
the
boundaries
of
the
ambient
air
area
are,
and
if
epa
cannot
review
any
of
those
discretionary
decisions,
it
has
essentially
no
authority
to
do
anything
under
this
act
except
to
require
that
permitting
authorities
mouth
the
words
of
the
statutory
definition.
and
that's
it.
and
if
that's
all--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--alaska
made
a
determination,
but
it
did
not
determine
best
available
control
technology
within
the
constraints
of
the
statute,
and
the...
and
the
easiest--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
they...
they
didn't
determine
the
maximum
degree
that
is
achievable,
taking
into
account
these
factors,
because
the
only
basis
for
their
rejection
of
the
best
technology
selective
control...
i
mean,
selective
catalytic
reduction
was
their
reliance
on
economic
impacts,
and
specifically
what
they
said
was
the
foremost
consideration...
the
foremost
consideration...
for
their
rejection
of
scr,
according
to
the
state...
this
is
at
page
208
of
the
joint
appendix...
was
impact
of
the
cost
of
scr
on
the
competitiveness
of
the
mine.
and
yet--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--what's
wrong
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
on
the
previous
page,
on
page
207
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
state
admits
that
because
cominco
refused
to
provide
the
financial
information,
they
had
no
basis
for
making
a
judgment.
that's
a...
they
quote
judgment.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
they
couldn't
make
a
judgment
about
that
very
issue.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
on...
on
an
appropriate
record,
absolutely
they
could
do
that.
and...
and
epa
made
it
clear--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct.
the
state
has
the...
has
discretion,
but
that
discretion
is
not
unlimited,
and
that
is
the
point
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
state
court,
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
believe
so.
it's
an
unsettled
question
i
think
whether
1345
would
authorize
epa
to--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct.
the
epa
has
consistently
maintained
and...
and
has...
has
announced
this
interpretation
in
a
variety
of
administrative
documents,
including
through
notice...
in
the
course
of
notice
and
comment
rulemakings
and
in
the
very
orders
in
this
case.
epa
has
consistently
taken
the
position
for
20
years,
at
least,
that
it
has
authority
under
these
statutes,
7477
and
7413(a)(5)
to
do
exactly
what
it
did
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--taking
the
last
part
of
your
question
first,
your
honor,
there's
nothing
particularly
strange
about
an
appellate
court
reviewing
a
prior
determination
of
whether
an
agency
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
courts
do
that
all
the
time--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--under
the
apa
when
a
district
court...
no.
if
a...
a
district
court
determines
whether
a...
whether
the...
an
agency
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
the
court
of
appeals,
to
the
extent
there
are
discretionary
issues,
they
would
review
deferentially,
but
really
as
a
general
matter,
it's
going
to
boil
down
to
a
question
of
law,
which
is
i
think
the
case
here,
which
is
was
it...
was
it
or
was
it
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
the
state
of
alaska
to
do
what
it
did
here.
fundamentally
that
is
a
question
of
law
upon
review
of
the
epa's
determination.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
the
state
agency
did
not
justify
its
final
permit
decision
on
that
rationale.
the
state
is
now
arguing
in
its
brief
in
this
court--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but
it's
more
than
that,
your
honor.
the
state
agency
expressly
rejected
that
analysis,
refused
to
conduct
that
analysis,
refused
to
base
its
permit
decision
on
that
approach
because
it
agreed
it
was
contrary
to
the
requirements
of
the
act.
that's
at
page
199
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
state
agency
said
we
are...
we
agree
that's
not
an
appropriate
way
in
which
to
analyze
the
bact
question.
that's
consistent
with
epa's
regulations,
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
and...
and
chevron
itself
actually
discusses
this,
as
you...
as
you
suggested,
but
chevron
recognizes
that
epa
has...
has
construed
the...
has
applied
the
bubble
concept
or
not
differently.
it...
the
bubble
concept
applies
at
the
initial
stage
in
determining
whether
a
modification
has
to
go
through
prevention
of
significant
deterioration
analysis.
but
once...
once
that...
once
it
is
determined
that
the
total
emissions
are
going
to
increase
so
that
the...
the
modification
does
have
to
go
through
that
analysis,
it
is
then...
the
bubble
concept
no
longer
applies
and
the
analysis
is
done
on
an
individual
basis.
that's
set
forth
in
epa
regulations
promulgated
through
a
notice
and
comment
rulemaking--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--as
a
matter
of
law,
what
epa
has
determined
in...
in
exercising
in...
its
rulemaking
authority
is
that
the
statute
requires
that
once
it's
determined
that
the
bact
analysis
must
be
made,
it
must
be
made
on
an
individual
unit
basis,
which
is
exactly
what
the
state
ultimately
did
here.
the
state
conceded
that
is
correct
as
epa's
regulations
state.
only
in
its
recent...
in
this
court
is
the
state
now
trying
to
back
away
from
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
epa
gave
the
state
ample
authority
and
cominco
ample...
i
mean,
ample
opportunity
to
place
in
the
record
whatever
materials
they
wanted--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
ninth
circuit,
when
this
case
was
in...
in
the
court
of
appeals,
issued
an
order
directing
the
preparation
of
a
record
and
asking
the
parties
what...
to...
to
address
whether
the
record
was
complete
or
not.
cominco
and
the
state
said
the
record
was
sufficiently
complete.
the
only
things
that...
that
the
state
identified--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
don't
know
that
the
whole--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the...
the
administrative
fills
a
box.
it
contains
internal
adec
communications,
memoranda,
analysis,
the
cominco
application.
it's
quite
detailed.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
absolutely.
and...
and
again,
under
overton
park
and
under
this
case's
precedents,
if
the
epa
record
is
incomplete
for
some
reason,
the
court
can
remand
it
to
the
agency
for...
for
further...
to
complete
the
record.
but
that
doesn't...
that
doesn't
suggest
that
epa
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
act.
it
merely
suggests
that
epa
needs
to
exercise
that
authority
in
a
procedurally
correct
manner.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
upon
further
consideration
of
this
court's
more
recent
precedents
in
the...
in
the
area
of
finality,
the...
the
whitman
case
and
bennett
against
spear
and
given
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
agency...
where
epa
was
not
simply
issuing
an
order
to
someone
saying
you're
violating
preexisting
requirements
of
the
act,
but
was
in
fact
changing
the
status
quo
and
stating
that
a...
a
permit
that
had
been
issued
by
the
state
that
allowed
construction
could
not
take
effect,
in
those
circumstances
we...
we
concluded
that
this
court's
precedents
regarding
final
orders
are
satisfied
and
that
this
is
indeed
a
final
order
because
it
imposes
legal
obligations,
new
legal
obligations,
on
cominco.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
has
to
have
evidence
sufficient
to
make
a
finding
that
the
state
is
not
complying
with
the
requirements
of
the
act,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it's
difficult--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
in
this
case
it's...
although
they
had
extensive
record
materials
before
them,
the...
the
flaw
in
the
state's
decision
making
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
state's
own
decision.
as
i
said
before,
pages
207
and
208
of
the
joint
appendix
revealed
that
the
state
admits
it
doesn't
have
factual
support
for
what
it
views
as
the
foremost
consideration
justifying
its
decision.
but...
but
if
epa
issued...
issued
an
order
under
this
act
without...
without
the
record
materials
in
front
of
it,
and...
and
had...
therefore,
had
no
basis
for
issuing
an
order,
a
court
of
appeals
could
set
it
aside.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
think
it
is
wrong,
your
honor.
it
is...
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
if
they
installed
this
expensive
generator
and
spent
millions
of
dollars
on
it
and
never
once
turned
it
on
and
they
ran
all
of
their
other...
other
generators
100
percent
of
the
time
without
ever
stopping
them,
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
there
could
be
slightly
more
pollution.
however,
that
is
highly
implausible,
number
one,
and
number
two,
there
is
no
finding
by
the
state
that
that
is
in
fact
what
would
happen.
this
is
merely
argument
in
their
appellate
briefs.
and
what
is
clear
on
the
record
is
that
under...
if
the
state
had
adopted
scr
as
bact,
the
total
cap
on
emissions
allowable
by
this
facility
would
be
hundreds
of
tons
lower
than
the
cap
that
was
imposed
by
the
state.
that's
undisputed
and
perfectly
clear
that
scr
would
result
in
a
total
emissions
cap
far
lower
than
the
one
that
the
state
wanted
to
impose.
and
so
the
state's
argument,
unsupported
by
any
findings,
is
that...
is
the
sheer
speculation
that
cominco
would
spend
millions
of
dollars
to
install
a
generator
that
it
would
never
use.
we
submit
that's
highly
improbable.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
if...
if
they
installed
this
generator
and
if...
if
selective
catalytic
reduction
were
deemed
to
be
required,
the
total...
there's
a
total
emissions
cap
of
3,878
tons
in
the
state's
permit.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
for
all
seven
generators.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
and
if...
and
that
includes
mg-17
under...
using
the
low
nox.
under
low
nox,
mg-17...
its
output
is
531
tons
if
it's
used
throughout
the
year,
531
tons.
under
scr
it
would
output...
put
out
only
a
tenth
of
that
at
full
capacity.
so
the
total
cap
under
bact
would
be
hundreds
of
tons
lower,
slightly
less
than
3,500
tons.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the...
the
total
emissions
cap
would
be
lower.
the...
the
company
is
free
to...
to
choose
how
to...
how
to
meet
the
cap,
how
to...
which
machines
to
operate
at
what
times,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
exceed
that
cap.
but
the
cap
is
determined
by
adding
to
the
preexisting
cap
total
for
the
other
six
generators
the
additional
amount
that
is
deemed
permissible
to--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--absolutely.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
correct.
your
honor,
we...
your
honors,
we
submit
that
congress
clearly
intended
epa
to
exercise
meaningful
enforcement
authority
in
the
prevention
of
significant
deterioration
program.
indeed,
it
specifically
authorized
in
that
very
context
epa
to
issue
the
types
of
orders
at
issue
here.
we,
therefore,
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
