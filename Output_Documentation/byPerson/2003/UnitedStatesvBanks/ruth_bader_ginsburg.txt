--are
there...
are
there
guidebooks?
is
there
any
manual
that
federal
law
enforcement
officers
use
that
will
say
in...
in
a
knock
and
announce
situation,
these
are
the
relevant
factors?
do
they
suggest
a
time,
a
time
span
that
would
be
appropriate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
nothing...
nothing
written
down
that
suggests
how
many
seconds,
no
manual
that
federal
law
enforcement--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
salmons?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
flexibility
mean
that
there
really
isn't
this
bright
line
between
exigent
and
nonexigent?
there's
kind
of
a
spectrum.
so
while
it's
not
exigent
enough
to
do
away
with
the
knock
and
announce,
there
is
then
a
difference
between
the
case
justice
souter
posed
of
the
grand
piano
and
the
warrant
is
to
search
for
drugs
which
could
easily
be...
be
disposed
of.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
100
percent
exigent,
but
neither
can
one
say
it's
nonexigent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you...
do
you
think
that
the
dissenting
judge
fisher
got
it
essentially
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
don't
we
take
the
ninth
circuit's
own
subsequent
case
where
it
has
a
footnote?
this
is
chavez-miranda--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
the
court
said,
banks
appears
to
be
a
departure
from
our
prior
decisions.
as
noted
by
the
trial
court,
we
have
found
a
10
to
20-second
wait
to
be
reasonable
in
similar
circumstances.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
is...
isn't
15
to
20
seconds
ample,
if
the
question
is
reasonable
time,
in
a
small
apartment
to
get
to
the
door
to
open
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
the
time...
it
is
the
time
in
which
a
telephone
would
ring
at
least
twice
and
perhaps
three
times.
usually
people
pick
up
a
phone
after
the
second
ring.
if
they
can
manage
to
do
that,
why
wouldn't
one
expect
the
same
interval
would
apply
in
getting
to
the
door?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
but
isn't...
isn't
the
problem
that...
that
justice
ginsburg
is
asking
you
about
what
is
a
reasonable
time,
and
your
answers
always
get
to
the
point
of
saying,
well,
there
are
particular
facts
that
might
have
taken
somebody
longer
than
a
reasonable
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they...
they
knew
they
were
dealing
with
drugs,
that
the
warrant
was
to
search
for
drugs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
get
rid
of
it,
but
as
i
suggested
to
mr.
salmons,
maybe
there
isn't
this
dichotomy
between
exigent
and
nonexigent,
but
that
it's
not
exigent
enough
to
avoid
knock
and
announce
altogether.
on
the
other
hand,
it
isn't
like
the
grand
piano.
that's
not
going
down
the
toilet.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
and
he
says
it's
a
minimum...
a
minimum
of
15,
and
you
used
the
word
maximum
a
few
times.
there's
no
evidence
of
15
maximum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
that
they
believe.
they've...
they've
established
probable
cause
before
a
magistrate,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there's
contraband
in
the
apartment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
given
his
condition
when
he
did
come
to
the
door,
it's
likely
that
30
seconds
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference.
isn't
it
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
going
back
to...
to
not
getting
into
the
inevitable
discovery
rule,
but
you
have
said
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
right
although
not
its
opinion.
so
if
you
were
to
explain
why
that
judgment
is
right,
what
would
you
say?
what
would
you
say
about
destroying
the...
the
door?
what
would
you
say
about
the
15
to
20
seconds?
what
would
be
the
opinion
that
you
would
write
to
justify
this
judgment?
