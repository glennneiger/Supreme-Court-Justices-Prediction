did
the
court
here
say
that
these
were
the
only...
the
only
four
factors?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
it
says
that...
that
those
factors
are
not
exclusive.
they
say
they're...
they
include
but
are
not
limited
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
not
if
there
are...
but
not
if
there
are
other
law
enforcement
concerns.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what
troubles
me
is
you...
you
can't
simply
announce
that...
that
the
rule
is
you
wait
a
reasonable
amount...
what...
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
of
time
is
how
long
it
would
be
expected
someone
would
take
to
get
to
the
door.
you...
you
can't
adopt
that
as
your
uniform
rule
because
otherwise,
you'd
have
to
use
the
same
amount
of
time
whether
there
are
exigent
circumstances
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
takes
20
seconds
usually,
it
takes
20
seconds.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
just
saying
the
exigent
circumstances
would
not
alter
what
is
a
reasonable
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
yes,
but...
but
that
also
is
not
affected
by
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of...
of
exigent
circumstances.
so
the
exigent
circumstances
sort
of
override--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
long
it
would
take
a
reasonable
person
to
get
to
the
door.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that's
not
enough
to
forego
knock
and
announce,
but
it
is
enough
to
shorten
the
time
period
that
you
have
to
wait.
justice
antonin
scalia
those...
those
are
all
breaks
in
favor
of
the...
of
the
citizen.
this
is
a
break
that
is
not
in
favor
of
the
citizen.
there...
there
may
be
some
of
us
who
are
willing
to
twist
the
statute
for
the
benefit
of
the
citizen,
but
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
it's
a
good
point
at
all.
i
think
refusing
admittance
means
refusing
prompt
admittance.
it
doesn't
say
you
can
come
in
next
week.
that's
refusing
admittance.
knock,
knock,
i
want
to
come
in.
you
can't
come
in
now.
you
can
come
in
next
week.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
refusing
admittance.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
do
you
say
that
the...
the
property
line
is
improper
only
when
there
are
exigent
circumstances
or
in
all
situations?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
a...
a
police
officer
shouldn't
wait
any
longer
before
he
rips
my
door
down,
leaving
the
house
exposed
to...
to
burglars
than
he...
than
he
has
to
wait
when
that
isn't
necessary,
when
the
door
is
open
and
he
can
just
walk
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
i'm
excluding
the
latter.
i'm
saying
there
are
no
other
exigent
circumstances,
not
even
the...
the
moderate
exigent
circumstances
that
are
not
enough
to
enable
you
to
go
in
without
knock
and
announce.
there
are
just
no
other
exigent
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
reason
whatever.
all
they're
looking
for
is
how
long
is
it
reasonable
to
wait
for
me
to
come
to
the
door.
and
you're...
you're
telling
me
it
is
just
as
reasonable
for
them
to
have
to
wait
only
15
seconds
when
their
entry
simply
requires
walking
in
and
still
15
seconds
when
it
requires
them
to
bash
in
the
door.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a...
an
application
of
totality
of
the
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
does
the
shower
have
to
do
with
it?
is...
is
it
your
contention
that
a
reasonable
time
is
how
long
it
takes
somebody
to
complete
a
shower?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then...
then
of
what
relevance
is
the
shower?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
of
no
relevance
at
all.
this
fellow
said
he
was
taking
a
shower.
well,
surely
you
don't
have
to
wait
as
long
as
it
takes
the
normal
person
to
complete
a
shower.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
presumably
dry
himself
and
presumably
put
on
a
towel.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
and
we
don't
care
because
that
surely
does
not
determine
what's
a
reasonable
time
to
wait.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me...
let
me
talk
about
the
small
apartment.
might
it
not
be
the
rule
that
when...
when
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
the
amount
of
time
you
have
to
give
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
long
it
takes
to
get
to
the
door.
it
has
to
do
with
how
long
it's
reasonable
to
wait
with...
without
impairing
the
law
enforcement
purpose
that
is
threatened
by
the
exigent
circumstances?
i
cannot
imagine,
can
you,
that...
that
people
dealing
with
drugs
are
perfectly
safe
so
long
as
they
do
it
in
a
really
big
house
with
lots
of
toilets?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay?
so
you
have
to
wait
45
seconds.
they
could
way
over
at
the
other
end
of
the
house.
what
is
a
reasonable
time
for
this
house?
it's
45
seconds.
so
let's
do
all
of
our...
all
of
our
drug
activity
in...
in
a
big
house.
that
can't
be
the
rule.
it
seems
to
me
the
reasonable
time
is
what
is
reasonable
to
go
in
in
order
to
prevent
the
exigent
circumstance
from
frustrating
law
enforcement.
doesn't
that
make
more
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
length-of-the-shower
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you're
not
inclined
to
flush
it
down
the
toilet
when
there's
nobody
knocking
at
the
door.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
this
is
valuable
stuff.
you're
going
to
get
rid
of
it
during
those
7
days?
you're
going
to
get
rid
of
it
after
you
hear
somebody
saying,
police
at
the
door.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
was
taking
a
shower.
he
probably
didn't
even
hear
them
at
the
door.
justice
antonin
scalia
had
he
not
been
taking
a
shower,
he
might
have
been
flushing
the
toilet.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
a
question
just
with
regard
to
your
opposing
counsel's
last
assertion.
do...
do
you
know
whether
the
rule
you're
arguing
for
would
have
been
applied
in
1791?
