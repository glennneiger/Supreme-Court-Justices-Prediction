we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
02-473,
the
united
states
v.
lashawn
lowell
banks.
mr.
salmons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
others
who
feel
equally.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
time
did
this
take
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
salmons.
mr.
roske,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ramirez
was
a
break-in...
a...
an
entry
into
not
the
house
of
the
person
who
was...
who
was
sought,
but
someone
else's
house
where
he
was
thought
to
be
staying.
the...
the
damage
was
done
not...
not...
to
someone
who
was
concededly
innocent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
had
a...
he
was
a
felon
in
possession
they
found.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
thing
i
thought
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
really
was
contrary
to
ramirez
was
its
stress
on
property
damage,
which...
which
ramirez
made
quite
clear
was
not
determinative.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
also
have
an
opinion,
e.g.,
ramirez,
which
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
even
cite,
which
says
that
property
damage
is
not
controlling.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if...
if
we're
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
reasonableness,
certainly
we've
got
to
take
into
consideration
common
sense
factors
that
may
be
suggested
other
than
by
the
officer
at
the
door.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the...
the
drugs,
the...
the
fact
that
it
was
a
drug
charge
and
that
drugs
were
thought
to
be
on
the
premises?
do
you
not
think
that
gives
then
officers
at
least
a
factor
other
than
the
simply
bare
bones
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
guilty
perhaps
benefit
more
than
the
innocent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roske.
mr.
salmons,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-473,
united
states
against
banks
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
