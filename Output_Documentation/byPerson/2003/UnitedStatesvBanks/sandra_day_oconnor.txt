mr.
salmons,
are
you
relying
on
exigent
circumstances
here
because
it
was
a
drug
case
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
you
answer
my
question?
are
you
relying?
we
have
to
reweigh
this,
i
assume,
and
do
you
want
us
to
treat
this
as
an
exigent
circumstance
case
or
not?
yes
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
was
a
small
apartment,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
size?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
make
any
difference
if
the
occupant
says,
wait
a
minute,
i'm
in
the
shower,
i'm
coming?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
there
are
no
exigent
circumstances
of
the
type
that
would
eliminate
the
need
to
knock
and
announce
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
wasn't
ramirez
a
no-knock
entry
where
the
door--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
bashed
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
court
said
that
could
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
didn't
apply
the
statute
literally
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
it
had
been
30
seconds?
let's
put
it
that
way.
would
you
be
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--making
this
same
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
was
15
to
20,
the
point
justice
breyer
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
keep
saying
15,
but
i
thought...
i
thought
we
took
the
facts--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
15
to
20.
do
we
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
something
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
did
the
court
below
treat
it
as?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
don't
we
just
take
that
as
a
given
in
resolving
it?
you
don't
want
us
to
redetermine
the
facts,
do
you?
