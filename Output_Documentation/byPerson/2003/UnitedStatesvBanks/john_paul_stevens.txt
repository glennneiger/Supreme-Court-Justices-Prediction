go
ahead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
had
this...
i
was
just
curious
about
one
aspect
of
property
damage
and
so
forth.
if
a
citizen's
property
is
damaged
by
this,
who
pays
for
the
damage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
would
have...
that
would
not
apply.
this
was
really
a
state
search
rather
than
a
federal
search
even
though
it
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
right.
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
isn't
right.
right?
because
certainly
in
a
motel
room,
it
would
be
less
time
than
it
would
in
a
mansion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
may...
may
i
just
interrupt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
how
long
it
would
take
a
person
to
get
to
the
door.
it's
how
long
a
period
must
elapse
before
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
person
has
refused
to
come
to
the
door.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
the...
the
purpose
of
the
analysis
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
silence
is
the
equivalent
of
a
refusal?
because
the
statute
requires
a
refusal.
and
if
that's
true,
i...
i
am
really
kind
of
puzzled
as
to
why
the
possibility
of
disposing
of
drugs
affects
the
time
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
isn't
it
true,
if
you
just
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
inquiry
is
always
has
there
been
a
refusal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
not
relying
on
exigent
circumstances,
when
you
just
go
on
in
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
it
means
too,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
does
a
citizen
have
a
right
to
make
sure
that
they're
really
officers
by
getting
a
copy
of
the
warrant
or
something
like
that?
could
he...
could
a
citizen
come
to
the
door
and
say,
slide
the
warrant
under
the
door
and
i'll
look
at
it
and
i'll
let
you
in
if
i
think
you're
genuine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
occupant...
i
can
conceive
of
situations
in
which
an
occupant
might
be
concerned
that
perhaps
it's
not
a
genuine
law
enforcement
officer.
it's
somebody
who
wants
to
hold
up
the
house,
you
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roske,
do
you...
do
you
have
a
period
of
time
that
you
would
agree
was
reasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
set
a
rule
for
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
what
do
you
think
that
rule
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no.
i
think
you
have
agreed
the
fact
he's
in
the
shower
really
is
irrelevant
because
the
officers
didn't
know
it,
and
you
must
judge
these
things
ex
ante
not
ex
post.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
still
curious
if
you...
if
you
do
have
a
view
as
to
what
would
be
reasonable
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you
think
15
to
20
seconds
is
unreasonable.
do
you
have
a
view
as
to
what
would
have
been
reasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
so
you
have
to
be
contending
that
the
constitution
requires
them
to
wait...
the
constitution
and
the
statute
required
them
to
wait
a
certain
period
of
time
that
was
longer
than
15
to
20
seconds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
so,
i
just
wonder
if
you
have
a
theory
as
to
how
much
longer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
say
that
60
minutes...
60
seconds
would
have
been
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
we
talked
about
the
case
as
though
it
involves
just
searches
for
drugs.
but
isn't
it
true
that
in
this
case
and
in
fact
in
many
cases,
the
officers
will
also
pick
up
substantial
amounts
of
cash
and
weapons,
which
are
not
apt
to
be...
neither
of
which
is
apt
to
be
flushed
down
the
toilet,
i
wouldn't
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
disagree
with
the
fact
that
the...
or
the...
the
claim
that
the
statute
does
apply?
there
was
a
duty
to
knock
and
announce.
