justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't...
excuse
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
salmons,
may
i
ask
you
one
question
on...
on
your
timing
point?
your
claim
is
that
the...
that
the
issue
of
property
damage
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
reasonable
timing
as
distinct
from
reasonable
execution.
i
understand
your
argument
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
there
is
an...
an
exigency,
a
set
of
circumstances
that
said
you've
got
to
act
fast.
my
question,
though,
goes
to
the
situation
in
which
there
is
no
exigency.
you're...
you're
executing
a
warrant
for...
to
seize
a
stolen
grand
piano
or
something.
no
property
is
going
to
be
destroyed
if
you
wait
a
little
bit
longer.
in
that
case,
where
there
is
no
exigency,
not
at
the
beginning,
none
develops
while
you're
waiting,
doesn't
the
issue
of
property
damage
have
some
relevance
to
the
question
of
timing?
in
other
words,
if
there's
no
risk
that
anything
is
going
away,
isn't
it
reasonable
for
the
police
to
say,
okay,
give
them
another
minute
or
something
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
when...
when
you're
dealing...
let's...
let's
take
the
case
in
which
the
exigency
develops
while
you're
waiting.
one
reason
why
it
is
reasonable
to...
to
suspect
that
you
are
being
denied
admittance,
let's
say,
in
a
case
where
drugs
are
easily
disposable
is
that
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
somebody
would...
another
10
or
20
or
whatever
seconds
will
use
the
20
seconds
to
get
rid
of
the
drugs,
if
possible.
you
don't
have
any
basis
for
drawing
that
kind
of
a
conclusion
in
the
grand
piano
case,
and
there...
there
is
less
reason
to
believe,
less
reason
to
suspect
that
you
are
actually
being
denied
admittance
as
opposed
to
simply
being
the
victim
of
somebody
who's
slow
at
getting
the...
to
the
door.
isn't
that
a
fair
line
of
reasoning?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
salmons,
as
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
should
we
consider
these
two
possibilities
in
justice
scalia's
case?
possibility
one,
no
exigency
again,
just
take
his
premises
as...
as
he
gave
it.
possibility
one,
the
police
knock
on
the
door;
they
say,
police,
search
warrant.
a
guy
on
the
inside
says,
i
don't
want
to
see
you.
the
police
say
at
that
point,
come
on,
we're
serious.
we've
got
a
warrant
out
here.
open
up.
possibility
two,
same
thing.
the
guy
says,
i
don't
want
to
see
you.
the
police
bash
the
door
down.
isn't
the
fact
that
the
police
could
say,
come
on
open
up,
we're
serious
a
factor
to
take
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether,
at
the
point
the
fellow
says
i
don't
want
to
see
you,
it's
right
for
them
to
bash
the
door
down?
justice
david
h.
souter
exactly,
and
if
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i...
i
think
so
too.
that's
why
i
put
it
that
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
the
only
question
that
you
ask,
i
think
you
are
taking
a
very
narrow
view
of
totality
of
circumstance.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
that,
of
course,
is
always
true.
they
might
have
been
asleep
at
2:00
in
the
afternoon.
they
might
have
been
sick
with
a
virus
so
that
they
couldn't
get
up
quickly.
there
are
all
sorts
of
reasons.
but
the
issue
is...
is
an
issue
of
a
reasonable
time
under
the
circumstances
known
to
the
officer.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're
the
ones
who
have
to
decide
how
long
to
wait.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
roske,
going
back
to
your
inevitable
discovery
point,
was
that
raised
by
the
government
in
the
district
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
also
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
at
2
o’clock
on
a
wednesday
afternoon,
federal
and
local
law
enforcement
officers
went
to
the
respondent
banks'
apartment
to
execute
a
search
warrant
for
cocaine.
they
called
out
police
search
warrant
and
rapped
loudly
on
the
door.
after
15
to
20
seconds
passed
with
no
answer,
the
officials
broke
open
the
door
with
a
battering
ram.
banks
was
in
the
shower
and
he
later
testified
that
he
heard
nothing
until
the
door
crashed
open.
the
ensuing
search
revealed
weapons,
crack
cocaine,
and
other
evidence
of
drug
dealing.
after
being
charged
with
drug
and
firearms
offenses,
banks
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
arguing
that
the
officers
had
waited
an
unreasonably
short
time
before
forcing
entry,
and
so
violated
both
the
fourth
amendment
and
18
united
states
code
3109.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion,
but
a
divided
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
in
order
to
the
suppression
of
the
evidence.
specifically,
the
circuit
court
treated
this
case
as
one
that
presented
no
exigent
circumstances
demanding
quick
action
with
the
outset,
and
it
held
that
the
officers
lacked
adequate
justification
for
using
force
to
enter
so
soon
after
knocking.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
reverse
and
hold
that
the
15
to
20
seconds
wait
before
the
forceable
entry
satisfied
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
statute.
we
held
in
richards
v.
wisconsin
that
the
obligation
to
knock
and
announce
gives
way
when
officers
get
reasonable
grounds
either
to
expect
that
waiting
is
futile,
or
to
suspect
that
knocking
and
announcing
would
trigger
some
exigency
such
as
a
risk
that
evidence
will
be
destroyed
immediately.
we
held
in
the
united
states
v.
ramirez,
that
police,
in
exigent
circumstances,
may
damage
property
as
far
as
necessary
for
a
no-knock
entry
without
demonstrating
the
exigency
in
any
more
detail
and
for
non-forceable
unannounced
intrusions.
the
principles
underlying
these
cases
govern
the
result
in
this
case.
here,
the
police
arrived
at
banks'
door
without
reasonable
suspicion
of
any
facts
justifying
a
no-knock
entry,
and
they
honored
their
obligations
in
knock-and-announce.
we
think
however,
that
after
15
to
20
seconds
without
a
response,
the
police
could
fairly
view
the
circumstances
as
requiring
them
to
act
without
further
delay.
they
could
reasonably
suspect
that
cocaine
evidence
would
be
destroyed
if
they
waited
any
longer.
what
matters
here
is
the
opportunity
of
someone
inside
the
apartment
to
get
rid
of
cocaine.
this
turns
on
the
arrival
of
the
police
during
the
day
when
occupants
would
probably
have
been
up
and
around
in
the
sufficiency
of
15
to
20
seconds
to
start
flushing
cocaine
down
the
drain
once
an
occupant
would
have
known
he
police
were
outside.
as
soon
as
the
exigency
had
matured,
the
officers
were
not
bound
to
learn
anything
more
or
wait
any
longer
before
going
in
even
though
their
entry
entailed
property
damage.
we
see
no
reason
to
treat
a
post-knock
exigency
differently
from
its
no-knock
counterpart.
we
reject
however
the
government’s
suggestion
that
the
need
to
damage
property
should
not
be
part
of
the
reasonable
analysis
in
a
case
with
no
reason
to
suspect
an
exigency
or
futility
in
waiting.
the
wait
time
may
well
be
longer
before
the
police
may
reasonably
make
a
force
entry
since
they
ought
to
be
more
certain
that
the
occupant
has
had
time
to
answer
the
door.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
