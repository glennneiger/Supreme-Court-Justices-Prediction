stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
they
get
out
of
it?
because
how
do
you
say...
i
mean,
suppose
the
person
from
behind
the
door
says,
oh,
police,
you'd
like
to
come
in.
i'll
let
you
in.
come
right
in,
but
just
wait
1
minute
while
i
flush
the
drugs
down
the
toilet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
he's
not
refusing
him
admittance.
i
mean,
he's
welcoming
him.
so
how...
how
is
the
court...
with
open
arms.
he's
delighted
to
have
him
in.
he
says,
it'll
just
take
a
second.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
now,
how...
how...
how
has
the
law
reconciled
that
which
is
obvious
that
he
ought
to...
the
police
ought
to
be
able
to
get
in
there...
with
the
statute
that
says
they
cannot
come
in
unless
he
refuses
the
police
admittance?
and
he
hasn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
they
read
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
it's
wrong,
well,
the
argument
the
other
way
is
what
they
said.
in
the
lower
court,
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
the
police
waited
a
maximum
of
15
to
20
seconds,
and
the
police
say
and
the
government
says
that's
way
more
than
enough
time
to
flush
the
drugs
down
the
toilet.
all
right?
so
every
other
circuit
has
said
10
seconds,
15
seconds,
is
the
maximum,
6
seconds,
and
even
the
ninth
circuit
has
normally
held
that
15
to
20
seconds
is
long
enough
to
wait
when
it's
a
small
house,
daylight
so
people
are
awake,
and
all
it
would
take
is
about
2
seconds
to
get
rid
of
the
evidence.
so
they've
all
said
that.
and
this
case,
they
say,
is
an
outlier.
this
is
well
beyond
what
every
other
circuit
has
done
and
doesn't
make
any
sense.
because
the
drugs
will
just
be
destroyed.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
that's
the
basic
argument.
i'd
like
to
hear
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
view
is
the
fourth
amendment
then
says
even
though
you
have
a
warrant,
probable
cause
for
believing
there
are
drugs
there,
and
it's
easy
to
get
rid
of
them,
there's
just
nothing
the
police
can
do
about
it
except
not
prosecute
the
drug
cases
in
these
situations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
first,
just
a
quibble.
but
i
read
the
lower
court
as
saying
15
to
20
seconds,
and
i
take
it
as
20
seconds
because
given
that
statement,
had
this
been
20
seconds,
they
would
have
said
it
was
unlawful.
and
so
if
in
fact
you
concede
that
20
seconds
is
too
long,
then
i
guess
i'd
have
to
reverse
or
is...
you
know.
so...
so
what
i
want...
i'm...
i'm
taking
the
outer
limit
of
what
they
said.
now,
on
that,
i
want
to
be
sure
i've
got
a
complete
answer
from
you
because
i
was
pushing
you,
and
so
far
i've
said
all
the
circuits
say
15
to
20
seconds
is
certainly
enough
time
for
the
policemen
to
wait
where
it's
a
drug
case,
a
small
house,
and
you
could
easily
get
rid
of
the
evidence.
in
response
to
that,
you
said
that
you
thought
that
15
seconds...
but
you
should
say
20...
is...
is
actually...
they
have
to
wait
that
long.
now,
is
there
anything
other
than
your
opinion,
which
i
respect,
but...
but
what
i'd
like
to
know
is
whether
there
is
any
basis
in
authority
or
reason
or
something,
other
than
that,
that
would
support
your
position.
