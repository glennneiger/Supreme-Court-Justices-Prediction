justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
they
pay
the
claim
if...
if
in
fact
the...
the
person
is
arrested
and
is
there
and
is...
and
does
have
marijuana?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do...
do
you
pay
only
if
you're...
do
you
get
paid
only
if
you're
innocent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
this
is
a
background
issue,
and...
and
i
don't
mean
to
take
you
away
from
talking
about
the
ninth
circuit's
case
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
going
to
go
on
to
say
that
there
are
some
other
exigent
circumstances
that
are
in
the
background
here
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
counsel
against
waiting
more
than
20
seconds?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
would
be
true
in
almost
any
drug
case
where
the
officers
know
that
drugs
are
in...
are...
are
in
the
premises
or
have
reason
to
believe
that
drugs
are
in
the
premises.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
sounds
to
me
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
the
kind
of
per
se
rule
that
we
rejected
in
the
case
that
came
to
us
from
wisconsin
in...
in
the
richards...
in
the
context
of...
of
determining
how
long
is...
is...
they're
required
to
wait.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
initial
question,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
wrong
because?
