mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
officers
in
this
case
went
to
respondent's
apartment
on
a
weekday
afternoon
to
execute
a
valid
search
warrant
for
drugs.
they
knocked
loudly
and
announced
their
purpose.
they
waited
at
least
15
to
20
seconds
without
hearing
any
response
and
then
forcibly
entered
the
apartment.
those
actions
were
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
otherwise
based
on
its
adoption
of
a
rigid,
four-part
categorical
approach
to
knock
and
announce
cases
that
is
fundamentally
at
odds
with
this
court's
precedents
in
two
critical
respects.
first,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
flexibility
that
is
an
essential
feature
of
this
court's
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
and
second,
it
turns
primarily
on
the
need
to
damage
some
property
in
order
to
effectuate
an
entry,
a
factor
that
under
this
court's
reasoning
in
ramirez
should
have
no
relevance
to
whether
the
entry
at
a
particular
time
was
itself
lawful.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor.
what
the
court
here
did...
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to...
to
page,
i
believe,
6a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
actually
beginning
on
page
5a.
what
the
court
does
is
it
first
creates
four
basic
categories
of
knock
and
announce
cases,
and
those
categories
are
defined
by
two
factors,
one
being
the
presence
of
exigent
circumstances
and
the
other
being
the
need
to
damage
property.
and
then
on
page
6a,
what
it
does
is
its
says
that
the
essential
question
of
whether
the
entry
was
reasonable
is
approached
in
the
following
way.
first,
we
characterize...
and
this
is
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
6a.
in
addressing
that
inquiry,
we
characterize
entries
as
either
forced
or
non-forced,
meaning
either
property
is
damaged
or
not
damaged.
the
reasonableness
must
then
be
determined
in
light
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
now,
the
court
does
list
a
number
of
factors
that
it
thinks
are
relevant.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
take
no
issue
with
its
list
of
non-exclusive
factors
in
terms
of
whether
those
factors
are
relevant
to
the
question
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
the
difficulty
we
have
with
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
in
this
case
is
that
it
has
engrafted
a
rigid
property
destruction
rule
onto
the
fourth
amendment's
flexible
standard
of
reasonableness
and
onto
this
court's
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
in
other
words,
what
the
court
of
appeals
does
is
it
requires
that
where
an
entry
is
non-forcible,
again
meaning
no
property
need
be
destroyed,
then
the
officers
must
wait
a
significant
amount
of
time
before
entry.
but
where
some
property
damage
is
required,
it
would
require,
quote,
an
explicit
refusal
of
admittance
or
the
lapse
of
an
even
more
substantial
amount
of
time.
and
we
think
that
that
both
is
inconsistent
with
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
standard
because
it
imposes
this
rigid
rule
of
property
damage,
and
it's
inconsistent
with
ramirez
which
makes
clear
that
the
need
to
damage
property,
although
it's
certainly
relevant
to
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
the
manner
of
the
execution
of
the
warrant
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
not
a
relevant
inquiry
into
whether
the
entry
at
a
particular
time
is
itself
lawful.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
your
honor,
there
is...
there
is
a
statute
that
congress
has
enacted
and
that
is
31
u.s.c.
3724,
and
that
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
pay
out
sums
of
money
up
to,
i
believe,
$50,000
to
pay
for
any
damage
to
property
that
may
result
from
law
enforcement
activities.
the
way
that
it
typically
works,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
a
significant
fund
set
up
based
on
forfeiture
assets,
and
that
those
funds
are
used
to
pay
for
damage
to
property
that
may
result
during
the
course
of...
of
a
search
or...
or
other
law
enforcement
activities.
typically
what
happens
is
the
law
enforcement
officers
will
not
leave
the
premises
until
it
is
at
least
secured,
and
then
they
provide
forms
or
other
information
so
that
individuals
can
make
claims--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--for
any
property
that
is
damaged.
and...
and
at
least
with
regard
to
federal
law
enforcement
practices,
those
claims
are
readily
paid
out
and
there
are
funds
to
do
so
through
the
forfeiture
proceeds.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
this
was
a
joint
search,
your
honor.
this
was
a...
the...
the
search
was
conducted
by
a
joint
task
force.
there
were
both
local
police
officers.
they
were
at
the
front
door.
there
was
an
fbi
agent
at
the
back
door.
we
think
that
this
search,
although
it's
not
in
the
record...
i
don't
know
exactly
how
it
occurred
in
this
case
with
regard
to
whether
any
claims
made
for
damage
to
the
door.
but
because
the
fbi
was
involved
in
the
search,
typically
that...
they...
they...
that
information
would
be
provided.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--it...
it
depends,
your
honor.
there
are...
there
are
factors
that
are
considered.
i'm...
i'm
not
entirely
sure
of...
of
what
all
of
them
are.
if
there
is...
i
would...
my
understanding
is
that
if
there
is...
certainly
if
there
was
another
individual
that
lives
in
the
home
or...
or
otherwise,
that
even
though
the
entry
was...
was
reasonable
and
the
need
to
destroy
or
damage
property
was
reasonable,
if
there
were
other
people
in
the
home,
the
officer...
the...
the
federal
law
enforcement
officials
typically
pay
that.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and
even
when
there's
not,
they
often
do
as
well.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
we
submit,
no,
your
honor,
and
for
the
following
reason,
that
in...
typically
the...
the
standard
would...
that
would
be
applied
in
this
kind
of
a
context
would
be
whether
the
officers
had
waited
sufficiently
long
so
that
they
could
reasonably
conclude
that
there
was
a
constructive
denial
of
admittance
or
that,
as
you
indicate,
other
law
enforcement...
excuse
me...
other
law
enforcement
concerns
may
justify
a
more
prompt
entry.
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
gave,
none
of
those
other
law
enforcement
concerns
are
present,
and
so
the
question
then,
we
submit,
would
be
whether
the
officers
could
reasonably
conclude
that
they
had
been
constructively
denied
admittance.
and
there,
the
need
to
damage
some
property,
if
it
exists
at
all,
is
a
consequence
of
the
denial
of
admittance,
not
a
factor
as
to
whether
the
denial
had
in
fact
occurred.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
mean,
i
think
the
distinction
your
honor
makes
between
those
types
of
cases
is
a
legitimate
one.
we
still
think
though,
however,
that
the
need
to
damage
property
is
really
not
a
factor
that
goes
into
whether
entry
at
a
particular
time
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
it's
a
consequence
of
the
denial...
excuse
me.
it's
a
consequence
of
the
occupant's
failure
to
respond
within
a
reasonable
time
period.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
there
is
training
that
occurs,
although
to
my
understanding,
there's
not
a
specific
amount
of
time
that's...
that's
provided
to
officers
that
they
need
to
wait
as
some
sort
of
minimum.
rather,
consistent
with
this
court's
cases,
the...
the
guidelines
and...
and
the
training
that's
conducted
teaches
the
officers
that
they
must
take
into
account
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
that
would
include
factors
like
how
large
of...
of
a
dwelling
it
is,
what
time
of
day
it
is.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
to
my
knowledge,
that
is
correct.
the...
it
used
to
be
the
case,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
a
suggested
amount
of
time
and
that
was
30
seconds
when
there
are
no
other
law
enforcement
concerns
that
are
at
issue,
but
that
currently
the
training
that
is
conducted
just
focuses
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
that
they
need
to
wait
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
and
if
there
are
no
other
law
enforcement
concerns
at
issue,
then
that
reasonable
period
of
time
is
typically
considered
to
be
how
long
it
would
take
to
conclude
that
you
were
constructively
denied
admittance--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
correct.
if
there
are
other
concerns--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that...
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that...
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and
that's
a
function...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no.
absolutely.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and
that's
why
we
submit
that
the
relevant
question
is
not
just
how
long
it
would
take
for
a
person
under
those
circumstances
to
get
to
the
door.
the...
the
analysis
must
take
into
account
as
well
valid
law
enforcement
concerns.
and...
and
all
this...
what
i
think
all
this
illustrates
is
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
which
is
this
is
a
contextual
analysis
that
has
to
be
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
there's
no
mechanical
rule--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--or
a
reasoned
way
to
apply
it.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
you're
correct.
you're
correct,
your
honor.
that...
and
that
would
be...
that
would
be
where
there
are
no
other
valid
law
enforcement
concerns
that
would
warrant--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that...
that's...
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
i
would
also--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
in
this
case,
let
me
begin
by
pointing
out
that
we
submit
that
the
15
to
20
seconds
that
the
officers
delayed
in
this
case
is
a
substantial
amount
of
time.
and
it's
no...
it's
really
nowhere
close
to
the
constitutional
line.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--by
your
question
you're
referring--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
only
reason
i
hesitated
is
because
i
think
the
term
exigent
circumstances
can
be
a
bit
ambiguous,
and
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
government
has
suggested
that
the
officers
were
entitled
to
forego
knocking
and
announcing
at
any
point
in
the
process.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
yes.
this
was
a
small
apartment.
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
it
was
a
two-bedroom
apartment.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
square
footage.
there
are
some
diagrams
of
the
apartment
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
testimony
of
the
officers
was
that
it
was
sufficiently
small
that
the
officers
located
in
the
back
of
the
apartment
could
hear
the
knock
and
announce
at
the
front
door.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
certainly
that
would
be
a
factor
that
would
then
go
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
standard.
whether
or
not...
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
that
the
officers
would
have
to
consider,
including
whether
they're
being
truthful,
whether
they
can
hear
water
running,
whether
there's
still
a
risk
that
they
may
have
drugs
with
them
in
the
shower,
dumping
them
down
the
drain.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct,
but
there
are
still--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
certainly--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
even
though
there
may
not
be
sufficient
concerns
about
officer
safety
or
the
destruction
of
evidence
to
forego
knocking
and
announcing
altogether,
those
are
still
valid
law
enforcement
concerns
in
the
context
of
a
case
like
this
where
the
officers
are
there
to
execute
a
warrant
for
drugs.
the
officers
are...
have
strong
evidence
that
there
are,
in
fact,
drugs
in
the
apartment.
they
did
a
controlled
buy
not
long
before
they
went
to
execute
the
warrant,
and
there
is
the
risk
at
a
minimum
of
the
destruction
of
evidence,
and
that
those
are
factors
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
certainly
i
think
the
potential
for
that
concern
is
present
in
almost
all...
and
not
just
drug
cases,
but
any
case
where
the...
the
evidence
to
be
sought
through
the
search
is
subject
to...
to
readily
destruction
and--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes,
your
honor,
that...
that
it's
not
enough
to...
at
least
in
the
context
of
this
case,
that
there
was
not
enough
reasonable
suspicion
of
those
concerns
to
forego
knocking
and
announcing
altogether,
but
those
factors
still
have
to
be
taken
into
account
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
evaluating
whether
the
officers
here
waited
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
we're
not
suggesting
some
rigid
rule
that
applies
in
all
cases.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
as
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
it...
it
must
be
the
case
that
the
officers
that
are
going
to
execute
the
warrant
can
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
evidence
they're
seeking
is
readily
disposable.
that...
all
we're
suggesting
is
that
should
be
a
factor.
it
should
into
the
analysis,
and
generally
that
would
be
a
factor
that
would
tend
to
cut
in
favor
of
a
prompter
entry.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i
think
we
would
disagree
with
your
characterization
of
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
at
least
in
part,
and
that
is
that
as
justice
souter's
question
earlier
pointed
out,
in
a
case
where
there
are
no
concerns
that
would...
that
would
warrant
a
more
prompt
entry,
we
think
the
question
is
whether
a
reasonable
officer
could
conclude
that
he
had
been
constructively
denied
admittance.
but...
but
where
there
are
those
concerns,
even
if
they
don't
rise
to
the
level
of
foregoing
knocking
and
announcing
altogether--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--they're
factors
that
cut
in
favor
of
a
prompter
entry.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
is
the
way--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
is
the
way
in
which
the
statute
is
worded,
your
honor.
this
court
has--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
we
think
not,
your
honor.
this
court
has
never
felt
that
the...
that
the
terms
of
this
statute
are
to
be
construed
literally.
in
fact,
if
the
court
were
to
start
doing
so,
it
would
need
to
overturn
a
number
of
its
prior
cases,
including
in
miller,
where
it
read
the
statute
to
reach
arrest
warrants...
or
even
arrests
without
warrants;
sabbath,
where
it
read
forcibly
break
to
not
require
any
chilling
of
force.
what
the
court
has
held
that
it
really--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
think--
[laughter]
i
think
there
may
be
a
more
benign
explanation,
which
is
this
court
has
recognized
that
what
this
statute
does
is
it
filled
a
gap.
there's
a
historical
explanation
that
this
statute
filled
a
gap
that
then
existed
in
federal
law
because
this
court
had
not
incorporated
or...
or
subsumed
the
common
law
principles
of
knock
and
announce
into
the
fourth
amendment
and
many
states
had.
and
so
what
congress
did
was...
and
this
court
reaffirmed
this
in
ramirez
not
long
ago,
that
what
the
statute
does
is
it
codifies
the
common
law
tradition
of
knock
and
announce,
and
that
includes
all
the
exceptions
to
knock
and
announce.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
right.
you
point
out
a
very
good
point,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
this
court
has
said
that...
that
the
statute
can't
be
read
literally
and
instead--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the...
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make,
your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make,
your
honor
was
that
what
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly,
and
it
said
in
ramirez
it
was
now
decisively
holding
and
resolving
the
question,
and
that
is
that
the
statute
here,
3109,
is
not
to
be
read
literally
but
merely
is
to
be
read
as
a
codification
of
the
common
law
tradition
of
knock
and
announce.
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
its
decision
in
wilson,
that
common
law
tradition
is
a
flexible
one,
and
it's
one--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--we
submit
so,
your
honor.
we
think
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's...
i
believe
that
is
our
position,
that...
that
although
there
were
not
sufficient
exigencies
in
this
case
to
justify
foregoing
knocking
and
announcing
altogether,
that
the
officers
here
were...
were
permitted
to
take
into
account
the
risks
inherent
in
executing
a
warrant
in
this
kind
of
a
context,
including
the
risk
of
destroying
of
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i'm
not
aware
of
case
law
on
that,
your
honor.
i...
i...
presumably
they...
they
are
permitted
to
do
that.
again,
all
of
that
would
go
into
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
any
response
from
the
occupants
i
think
are
things
that
the
officers--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well...
well,
certainly
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule,
your
honor,
is
to
provide
notice
to
the
occupants
that
it
is
the
police
that
are
attempting
to
come
in
so
that
it
increases
public
safety
and...
and
protects
both
the
officers
and
the
occupants.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
this
took
place
at
2
o'clock
on
a
wednesday
afternoon,
your
honor.
i
think
one
of
the
remarkable
things
about
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
is
that
the
officers'
delay
here
really
was
nowhere
close
to
the
constitutional
line.
15
to
20
seconds
is
a
substantial
delay.
even
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
this
case
based
only
on
the
question
of
whether
they
had
been
constructively
denied
admittance,
we
think
these
other
factors
warranted
a
prompter
entry
here.
and
in
fact,
the
testimony
of
the
officers
in
this
case
suggests
that.
the
officer
from
the
nevada
police
that
was
at
the
front
door
stated
that
he
waited
a
long
time
in
this
case
because
he
thought
there
was
some
chance
that
the
case
may
go
to
federal
court,
and
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
knock
and
announce
concerns.
the
fbi
agent
at
the
back
of
the...
of
the
apartment
testified
that
he...
he
became
concerned
about
the
length
of
the
delay.
he
described
it
as
unusually
long
and
stated
that
he
was
concerned
that
the
occupant
might
be
attempting
to
flee
from
another
way.
this
is
simply
not
a
case
that's
close
to
the
line,
and
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
hold
that
the
officers
in
this
case
were
required
to
wait
some
additional
period
of
time
that's
unspecified,
in
addition
to
the
15
to
20
seconds,
really
does
pose
threats
to
law
enforcement
officials
engaged
in
the
front-line
law
enforcement
activities
in
the
jurisdictions
covered
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
wrong
because
it
adopts
a
rigid
property
destruction
rule
and
engrafts
it
onto
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
and
that
rule
is
one
not
flexible
enough
to
be
consistent
with
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
and,
two,
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
ramirez
which
indicated
that
the
question
of
the
timing
of
an
entry
is
distinct
from
the
question
of
the
manner
in
which
the
entry
and
the
warrant
itself
are
executed.
the
destruction
of
property
may
very
well
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
it
is
needless
or
wanton,
but
that,
as
this
court
said
in
ramirez,
does
not
make
the
entry
unlawful
and
it
doesn't
require
suppression.
and
so--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
certainly
we
think
that
judge
fisher
was
correct
when
he
indicated
that
one
of
his
concerns
about
the
court
of
appeals...
the
panel's
decision
in
this
case
was
that
it
didn't
follow
its
own
list
of
factors.
we
also
think
judge
fisher
was
correct
when
he
indicated
that
all
one
needs
do
is
do
a
thought
experiment
and
think
to
yourself,
police,
search
warrant,
and
count
out
15
to
20
seconds
to
see
how
long
a
period
of
time
this
really
was.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
of
the
timing
of
the
entry
in
all
circumstances.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
why.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
the
reason
we
think,
one,
flows
from
this
decision
in
ramirez
where
the
court
differentiated
between
the
timing
of
the
entry
and
the
need
to
damage
property.
and
two,
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
what
the
officers
in
that
situation
have
to
take
into
account.
they're...
they're
waiting
and
they
have
to...
they
have
to
consider
how
long
they
have
to
wait
to
either
conclude
that
they've
been
constructively
denied
admittance--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--or
that
there
are
valid
law
enforcement
concerns
that
require
entry
at
that
time.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
in
that
case--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
we
would
disagree
because,
first
of
all,
it's...
it's
going
to
be...
it's
often
going
to
be
the
case
that
the
officer,
at
the
time
he
makes
the
decision
that
he's
been
constructively
denied
admittance,
doesn't
know
whether
the
door
is
locked
or
not,
and
he
really
can't
be
put
in
a
position
where
he
has
to
check
the
doors
and
windows
to
see
whether
any
are
unlocked
before
he's
allowed
to
enter.
he's...
he
has
a
warrant
that
authorizes
him
to
go
in,
forcibly
if
necessary,
secure
the
premises
and
search
for
the
evidence
covered
by
the
warrant.
that's
what
happened
here.
the
fact
that
the
door
happened
to
be
locked
or
unlocked
is
really
not
a
factor
that
the
officers
can
take
into
account
at
that
stage
of
the
process.
and
it--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--again,
your
honor,
we
think
the
relevant
inquiry
is
whether
a
reasonable
officer
could
conclude
that
he
had
been
constructively
denied
admittance.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and
it
seems
to
me
under
your
hypothetical,
he
probably
could.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and
so--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
again,
your
honor,
in...
in...
i
see
my
time
is
almost
up.
we
think
that
flows
from
the
principle
this
court
followed
in
ramirez
that
the
timing
of
the
entry
needs
to
be
separated
from
the
manner
in
which
the
entry
and
the
search
is
conducted.
that's
where
property
concerns
come
into
play.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
the
government
submits
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
your
honor,
what
i
do
know
is
that
as
this
court
indicated
in
its
decision
in
wilson
where
it
incorporated
the
common
law
tradition
into
the
fourth
amendment
standard
of
reasonableness,
that
the
standard
at
common
law
was
a
flexible
one.
it
didn't
require
knock
and
announce
in
all
cases,
and
it
took
into
account
a
variety
of
law
enforcement
concerns
and,
we
would
submit,
including
the
risk
that
there
might
be
dangers
to
the
officer's
safety
or
that
evidence
might
be
disposed
of.
so
we
think
that
our
rule
is
perfectly
consistent
both
with
the
common
law
tradition
and
with
this
court's
decision
in
wilson
that
incorporated
it.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we're
not
suggesting
there
was
some
exception
to
the
knock
and
announce
rule.
