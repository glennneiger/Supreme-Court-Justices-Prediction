mr.
randall
j.
roske
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court:
this
case
is
about
whether
your
door,
my
door,
and
everyone's
door
is
worth
15
seconds.
this
case
presents
the
component
of
the
knock
and
announce
statute
that's
the
refusal
component
that
this
court
has
not
addressed
previously
in
any
of
its
decisions.
in
wilson,
you
said
that
this
rule
is
of
constitutional
magnitude,
and
in
the
wisconsin
v.
richards
case,
you
said
there
can
be
no
blanket
exceptions
to
knock
and
announce
just
based
on
the...
the
kind
of
case
it
is.
and
then
we
see
in
ramirez
the
court
talks
about
3109
and...
and
so
we
see
a
line
of
cases
where
from
miller
where
we
were
dealing
with
sort
of
an
oversight
of
the...
the
court's
decisions
overseeing
the
criminal
justice
system
from
a
federal
standpoint--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--that's
true.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
that's
true.
and
there
were--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--yes.
and
the...
the
court
in...
in
ramirez
noted
that
there
were
all
kinds
of
indications
and
evidence
known
to
the
officers
of
the
person,
the
suspect,
the
fugitive
that
they
were
looking
for
being
armed,
dangerous,
likely
to
resist
forcibly
the
officers,
and
officer
safety
exceptions--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--no.
you
never
have,
as
far
as
i
understand
the
court's
decisions,
applied
a
literal
interpretation
of
the
3109.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
well,
he
wasn't
concededly--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--that
is
correct.
that
case
involved
a
fugitive
who
was
not
the
known
occupant
of
the
residence,
and
they
had
developed
information
that
this
individual
was,
however,
staying
at
the
ramirez
residence.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
well,
i
think
that
the
circuit,
ninth
circuit,
has
focused
on
property
damage
as,
you
know,
we
have
a
statute
that
talks
about
breaking,
and
it
sees
that
in...
in
the
context
of
delay
as
requiring
more
time.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
well,
and
that's
true
and
i...
i
concede
that
is
so.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
you
can
decide
that
those
guideposts
cited
by
the
ninth
circuit
are
flat
wrong
and
reach
the
ground
there
that
it
is
entirely
reasonable
under
a
totality
of
the
circumstance
test
that
you
affirm
the
decision.
you
can
do
a
decision
saying
that
the
guideposts
are
simply
wrong
under
ramirez,
but
the
result
under
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
is
correct.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
well,
the
response
would
be
that,
yes,
the
modern
marvel
of
indoor
plumbing
does
provide
an
avenue
for
the
destruction
of
evidence.
it
also
provides
people
the
opportunity
to
shower
themselves.
and
this
is
the
archetype
kind
of
activity
that
occurs
in
the
home
which
the
privacy
concerns
are
the
greatest
for.
and...
and--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--15
seconds
is
a...
is
virtually
no
time
at
all
to
respond
to
a
door.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
no,
but
that's
the
kind
of--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--the
relevance--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--i
agree.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
grab
a
towel.
in
this
case,
we
don't
know
how
long
mr.
banks
would
have
continued
the
shower,
whether
he
would
have
become
aware
of
the...
of
the
officers
at
his--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--right.
but
the...
but
the
point
of
the
shower
is
this.
anybody
that's
in...
in
a
home,
in
a
dwelling,
and
in
a
community
such
as
we
have
that's
24
hours,
anything
could
be
being...
sleeping
and
other
activities
where
that
would
cause
someone
to
be
unable
to
respond
within
15
seconds
can
occur.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
all
of
the
cases
that
were
cited
in
the
briefs
i
tried
to
distinguish
as
having
differences
that
were
fundamental
to
the
case,
the
sole
occupant,
for
instance,
they
know--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--right,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
i
think
that
the
court
in
chavez-miranda
focused
on
the
fact
there
were
numerous
occupants
in
the...
in
the
residence
and
that
even
if...
if
one
or
two
were
engaged
in
some
kind
of
private
activity,
the
others
would
be
able
to
respond
quickly
to
the
door.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
it's
not
reasonable
because
it's
virtually
no
time
at
all.
if
you're
in
the
bathroom
on
the
toilet,
if
you're
in
the
bedroom
naked--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--well,
there
are
plenty
of
times
that
you
may
be
home
and
you
don't
get
to
the
phone
in
time
because
you're
engaged
in
some
activity
that...
that
prevents
you
from
immediately
responding.
and
that's
the
point
of
this
case.
they
had--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--i
believe
that
we
cannot
simply
measure
the...
the
test
from
the
eyes
of
the
officer.
you
have
a
duty--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--right,
and
they...
what
did
they
know?
they
knew
nothing
in
terms
of
exigent
circumstances.
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--they
knew
that
they
were
searching
for
drugs,
yes,
and
not
grand
pianos.
but
the
fourth
amendment,
as
you...
as
you
interpreted
it
in
your
cases,
that...
you
know,
we
just
don't
get
rid
of
the
refusal
component
or
the
knock
and
announce
rule
simply
because
drugs
are
involved.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
well,
if
you
look
at
the
appendix,
joint
appendix,
at
page
75,
and
see
what
the
officer
said
about
why
he
entered,
he
simply
said
that
he
thought
that
15
seconds
was
reasonable
and
that
this
case
might
go
federal
and
they've
heard
about
problems
with
this.
and
he
doesn't
mention
anything
about
a
concern
that
evidence
is
being
flushed
or
that
he
heard
anything.
and
remember,
again,
this
is
a
small
apartment.
if
he
heard
the
toilet
flushing,
presumably
he'd
heard
that.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
i
think
that
the
test
should
be
a
protecting
of
the
individual's
rights
from
intrusions
that
are
unreasonable,
and
that
all
deference
should
not
be
given
to
law
enforcement
officers'
decisions.
in
this
case,
he
didn't
suggest
at
all
that
he
had
to
go
in
because
he
thought
drugs
were
being
chucked
in
the
commode.
it's
not
there
in
the
record
and
nowhere
in...
in...
below
or
in
the
ninth
circuit
did
the
government
argue
such
a
theory.
they
simply
said
it
was
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
well,
that's
correct,
but
i
think
this
court
has
a
supervisory
power
and
it
has
to
not
abdicate
all
decisions
to
the
officer
at
the
door.
and
this
officer
has
simply
made
a
subjective
decision
there,
saying
that
was
what
he
understood
would
be
reasonable.
there
was
an
earlier--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--well,
i
do
note
that
the
ward
case
cited
in
my
brief
talked
about
the
fbi
adopting
some
60-second
rule.
obviously,
that
would
have
been
about
45
seconds
more
time
than...
than
was
here.
i
think
that
you
can't
set
a
bright
line
rule
and...
and
that
it
has--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--well,
we
need
to
set
a
prophylactic
rule
that
recognizes
the...
the
dignity
and
the
importance
of
the
refusal
component.
in
this
case--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--i'm...
i'm
suggesting
that--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--right.
and
i...
i
agree.
just
as
they...
if
they
had
heard
the
toilet
flushing
repeatedly,
that
might
be
a
factor
to
hasten
their--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--well,
i
think
that...
that
certainly
15
seconds
was
an
unreasonably
short
period
of
time,
and
that--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--i
believe
that
a...
a
wait
towards
a
minute
might
be
more
reasonable
under
these
facts
where
they
have
absolute...
see,
they're
confronted
with
silence
at
the
door.
it's
not
as
if
there's
anything
giving
them
any--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--what
we're--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--well,
i...
i--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--honestly,
i
don't
know
what
would
be
a
figure
to
put
on
that.
i
just
know
that
this
15
to
20
seconds
was
too
little
time.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
it
would--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--my
argument
would
be
less
strong
as
more
time
passed.
in
this
fair
city,
you're
given
30
seconds
to
cross
a
major
boulevard
according
to
the...
the
flashing
time,
and
mr.
banks
had
less
than
15
to
respond
to
his
door.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
well--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--well--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--the
officer--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--the
officer
conducting
the
entry
testified
that
it
was
at
least
15
seconds.
now,
the
fbi
officer...
or
agent
in
the
back
of
the
building
thought
it
was
closer
to
20.
i
submit
that
the
officer
who--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--15
to
20
seconds.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
no,
i
do
not
wish
the
court
to...
to
redetermine
the
facts.
i
just
simply
point
out
that
of
the
two
time
frames
that
were
cited
below
in
the
record,
the
officer
at
the
door
was
in
the
better
position,
i
believe,
to
know
how
much
time
elapsed
since
he
was
conducting
the
entry.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
at
least
15
seconds
is
the
quote
that
i
have
at...
at
page
75
of
the
joint
appendix
of
the
officer
wilson.
and
the
refusal
component
of
the...
of
the
knock
and
announce
statute
is,
of
course...
it's
not
frozen
in
time,
i
understand,
but
it
was
considered
to
be
an
important
element
and
component
of
the...
of
the
knock
and
announce
statute.
it
wasn't
some...
it
had
dignity.
it
had
purpose,
and
its
purpose
is
served,
including
the
protection
of
the
officers,
when
they
come
to
the
door
and
knock
at
a
citizen's
residence.
and
they
knock
at
a
substantial
number
of
innocent
citizens'
residents,
and
their
doors
were
15
seconds
to
20
seconds,
absent
any
kind
of
exigent
circumstance
at
all,
that
they
may
just
simply
believe
that
they're
going
to
find
drugs
at
the
residence.
i
cited
in--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--they
did,
your
honor.
and...
but
what
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
they
waited
7
days
from
the
time
they
got
the
warrant
to
execute
it.
they
couldn't
wait
more...
a
few
more
seconds
at
the
time
they
were
at
the
threshold.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
well--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--well,
but
in
this
case
there
was
no
effort
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
there
was
any
destruction
of
evidence
by
mr.
banks
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
it's
an
overbroad
assumption
that
every
time
the
officers
come
on
a
search
warrant
for
drugs
that
the
person
that
they're
going
to
be
searching
is
going
to
go
to
the
commode
and
chuck
it.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
he
did
not--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--well,
we...
we
know...
all
we
know
is
that
he
was
in
the
shower
and
that
he
made
no
effort,
upon
hearing
the
door
crash
in,
to...
to
take
any
step
in
that
direction.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
well,
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine
i
know
has
been
much
raised
here
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
their
brief,
but
it
has
no
application
in
a
prophylactic
rule
that,
of
course,
as
the...
the
refusal
component
should
be.
obviously,
it's
not
a
situation
this
court
was
confronted
with
in
nix
where
there
was
an
independent
investigation
finding
a...
a
young
girl's
body,
that
the
investigation
by
the
community
to
find
that
was
wholly
independent
of
the
law
officers'
efforts
there
to
a...
a
confession.
so
it
just
has...
if...
if
you
find
that
there
is
a
violation
here
that...
that
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine
simply
would
have
no...
no
purpose
or
effect
in...
in
your
determination,
because
if
you
do
decide
that,
as
the
seventh
circuit
has,
that
inevitable
discovery
doctrine
applies
to
all
knock
and
announce
issues,
you'll
essentially
have
no
judicial
review.
you
have
the
title,
i
suppose,
1983
actions
that
might
be
brought
occasionally
but
those
are
of
no
real
deterrent
to
law
enforcement.
they--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--i
would...
i
would
focus
on
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
a
dwelling
and
not
an
office,
that
we're
dealing
with
a
habitation
where
private
activities
occur
and
routinely,
and
that
in
this
case
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
give
the
officers
at
the
threshold
any
additional
reason
or
justification
for
acting
with
haste.
i
would
say
that
the
court--
mr.
randall
j.
roske
--well,
yes,
i...
i
would
agree
that,
you
know,
obviously
if
it
were
televisions
or
if
it
were
grand
pianos,
the
idea
that
somebody
is
going
to
chop
them
into
splinters
or
into
fragments
and
the...
thwart
the
officer's
whole
purpose
would
entirely
evaporate.
it
was
argued
by
the
solicitor
general
that
in
fact
they
thought
that
maybe
the
place
wasn't
even
occupied
and
therefore
they
were
doing
an...
a
senseless
or
a
needless
act
by...
by
delaying
and
knocking
and
announcing
repetitively.
in
any
event,
i
think
that
this
case
is...
is
one
where
if
they
truly
believed
it
was
unoccupied,
that
there
would
be
no
harm
and
foul
on
the
officer
erring
on
the
side
of
caution
and
waiting.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
not
at
the
district
court,
not
at
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
randall
j.
roske
in...
in
fact,
in
this
case
there
were
three
firearms
recovered
from
mr.
banks'
apartment.
one
of
them
was
out
on
the
couch
in
the
front
room.
two
weapons
were
back
in
the
south...
i
believe...
east
bed...
west
bedroom,
excuse
me.
southwest
bedroom.
and
yes,
and
there
was
about
$6,000
of
currency
located
throughout
the
apartment.
the
dimensions
of
the
apartment
were
not
developed
below,
but
basically
the
place
is
about
20
by
33.
the...
the
layout
of
the
residence
is
put
in
a
diagram
that's
part
of
the
appendix.
and
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
in...
in
king
edward
i's
reign,
this
is
where
we
get
the
knock
and
announce
statute.
he
lived
in
unsettled
times,
and
he
was
actually
out
of
his
kingdom
when
the
word
that
his
father
had
died
came
to
him.
he
was
on
a
trip
from
the
holy
land,
and
he
was
in
genoa.
and
he
had
to
rush
back
to
his
kingdom
to
find
it
in
disarray.
his
men
were
running
amuck.
and
the
knock
and
announce
statute,
which
hails
from
the...
this
ancient
time,
was
passed,
just
to
prevent
the
kinds
of
abuses
that
we
can
see
happening
today.
there
was
a
reverend
in
boston
that
that
lost
his
life
as
a
result
of
the
law
enforcement
erroneously
searching
a
residence.
had
he
been
given
the
knock
and
announce
and
been
able
to
respond
to
the
door,
maybe
he
would
he
wouldn't
be
dead.
there's
another
instance
i
cited
in
my
brief
about
a
fortune
500
executive
who
had...
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
had
is
home
searched
erroneously
for
drugs,
and
he
was
shot
several
times
defending
his
habitation.
these
are
important
considerations
that
it's
not
just
the
guilty
that
are
protected
by
the
knock
and
announce
rule.
it
is...
it
is
everyone
that...
that
benefits,
the
innocent
and
the
guilty.
mr.
randall

roske
true
enough,
but
that...
but...
but
when...
when
we
have
a
suppression,
when
we
have
a
case
where
the
court
acts
as
it
has
in
the
banks
case,
that
provides
a
lesson
for
law
enforcement
that
they
do
heed,
and
it
has
a
deterrent
effect.
your
opinions
do
matter
greatly.
and
i
just
think
that
the
wise
decision
here
wouldn't
be
to
create
a
bright
line
rule,
to
set
in
stone
any
kind
of
time
limit,
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
one
that
needs
to
be
used.
and
i
know
that
the
ninth
circuit
struggled
with
the
fact
that
the
common
law
knock
and
announce
provision,
you
know,
dealt
with
concerns
of
destruction
of
the
door
and
destruction
of
the
habitation
and
concerns
of
privacy,
a
man's
home
being
his
castle.
and
we
do
that
no
honor
when
in
15
seconds
to
20
seconds
that
door
goes
down.
and
there
was
no
refusal
in
this
case,
and
the
record
is
entirely
barren
of
that.
and
that
component
was
required
at
common
law.
and
i
understand
at...
the
constitution
was
not
frozen,
you
know,
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
bill
of
rights.
it
has
developed
and
evolved,
but
all
of
the...
all
of
the
exceptions
that...
that
have
been
applied
by
the
lower
courts
in
this
area
are
distinguishable
from
banks.
and
i
thank
the
court
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
of
me.
