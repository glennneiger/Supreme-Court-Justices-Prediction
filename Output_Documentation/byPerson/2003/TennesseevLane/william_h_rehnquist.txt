we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
02-1667,
tennessee
v.
george
lane.
mr.
moore.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
an
action
under
ex
parte
young--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--against
a
state
official,
not
for
money
damages,
but
for
compliance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
city
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
city
of
boerne,
we
certainly
did
not
go
in
and
analyze
whether
the
church
has
a
claim
under
the
constitution
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
moore.
mr.
brown,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
mr.
brown,
as
applied
to
the
case
that's
before
the
court,
you're
suggesting
that
it
can
be
kind
of
sliced
up
and
just,
say,
address
courthouses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
in...
in
our
other
cases
dealing
with
congress'
section
5
power,
i
don't
think
we've
taken
that
position.
we
have
said,
particularly
in
the
city
of
boerne,
the
government
response
must
be
congruent
and
proportional,
which
suggests
that
there
may
be
constitutional
violations,
but
they're
simply
not
sufficient
to
justify
what
congress
did.
that's
the
meaning
of...
i
understood...
of
the
term,
congruence
proportionality.
now,
if
you...
if
you
simply
focus
down
narrowly
enough
and
say,
was
there
a
constitutional
violation
in
denying
the
church
the
zoning,
the...
that
really
eliminates
the
idea
of
proportionality
entirely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brown.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clement,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
you
said...
but
now
what...
what
does
it
mean
to
say
discrimination
in
voting?
does
that
mean
that
a
person
was
actually
not
allowed
to
vote?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
how
many
cases
do
they...
do
you
have
where
the
person
was
not
actually
allowed
to
vote
instead
of
not
being
facilitated
in
the
ability
to
vote?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
how
many
of
these
instances
did
congress
find
of
people
who
were
actually
refused
the
right
to
vote?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
order
of
magnitude?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
it...
would
it
be
a
violation...
a
constitutional
violation
to
refuse
to
afford
special
access
to
a
hockey
rink?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
decided
maybe
50
years
ago,
before
any
of
the
more
recent
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
think
there's
an
important
relationship
between
this
court
and
raines,
because
in
raines,
this
court
in
a
sense
identified
a
fault
line
in
a
statute
that
was
broadly
applicable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
moore,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
moore.
the
case
is
submitted.
