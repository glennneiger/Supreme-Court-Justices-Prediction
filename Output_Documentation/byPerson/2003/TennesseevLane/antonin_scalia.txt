justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
moore,
i'm
sort
of
concerned
about
this.
our
prior
cases
dealing
with
this
issue
of...
of
the
scope
of
congress'...
whether
congress'
power
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
properly
exercised,
none
of
our
prior
cases
parse
it
out
issue
by
issue.
boerne,
for
example,
doesn't...
doesn't
just
limit
it
to,
you
know,
to...
to
whether,
given
that
there
was
no...
no
discrimination
in
this
case,
congress
could
move.
you're...
what
you're...
the
state
of
tennessee
is
entirely
happy
to
have
us
change
course
and
begin
to
rule
upon
congressional
legislation
of
this
sort,
case
by
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
there
was
enough
evidence
on
courthouses,
whether
there
was
enough
evidences...
enough
evidence
on
each
of
the
other
innumerable
state
functions
that...
that
were
covered
by
this
bill.
but,
i
mean,
that's
the
argument
you're
making.
you...
you
just
want
us
to...
to
say
there's
not
enough
evidence
about
courthouses,
and
therefore,
in
this
case,
they
can't
do
it.
and
we'll
hear...
we'll
hear
another
case
further
down
the
line
about,
you
know,
any
of
the
other
innumerable
state
functions
that
are
impinged
upon
by
this
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
breyer's
question,
how
can
you
do
that,
reminds
me
of,
you
know,
there's
a
story
about
the
baptist
minister
who
was
asked
whether
he
believed
in
total
immersion
baptism,
and
he
said,
believe
in
it,
i've
seen
it
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that...
that
is
surely
the
situation
here.
we've
done
it
before
in...
in
each
of
the
other
cases
involving
this
area.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
moore,
you...
you
don't
concede,
i
assume,
that
the
constitution
is
violated
by
not...
not
providing
educational...
public
educational
facilities
that
will
be
accessible
to
all
handicapped
persons?
you
don't
concede
that
that's
a
constitutional
violation,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you...
you
need
a
rational
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
if...
if
the...
the
additional
expense
for
constructing
the
buildings
in...
in
a
manner
that
would
render
them
accessible
to
all
handicapped
persons
is
excessive,
it's
not
a
constitutional
violation.
now,
it
may
be
a
very
bad
idea,
but
we've
never
held
that
that's
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
saying
that
so
many
handicapped
persons
couldn't
get
into
public
schools
would
prove
nothing
at
all,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the...
the
commerce
power
exists
whether
or
not
other...
other
facts
are...
are
established.
it
is
a
power
that
congress
always
and
everywhere
possesses.
congress
does
not
always
and
everywhere
possess
the
power
to
subject
the
states
to...
to...
to
lawsuits.
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
power
exists
only...
only
when,
as...
as
we...
we
found
was
not
well-enough
established
in
boerne,
only
when
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation
by
the
states,
so
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
reason
for
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
answer
is
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
agree
with
that.
there
has
to
be
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
remedy
may
go
beyond
the
constitutional
violation,
but
there
has
to
be
a
constitutional
violation,
does
there
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
legislation
doesn't
deal
with
that
constitutional
right.
it
doesn't...
doesn't
mention,
you
know,
due
process
and...
and...
and
courthouses
specifically.
it...
it
embraces
innumerable
things.
and
what
you're
saying
is,
because
one
of
the
innumerable
things
that
it
embraces
happens
to
involve
a
constitutional
right,
the
legislation
is
a
valid
exercise
of...
of
section
5
power
as
to
that
particular
constitutional
right.
and
i...
that
doesn't
strike
me
as...
as
accurate.
if
congress
wants
to
enact
such
a
sweeping
statute,
a
statute
that...
that,
in
effect,
as
we
said
in
boerne...
what
was
going
on
in
boerne
was
that
congress
was
rewriting
the
first
amendment,
and
here
congress
is
rewriting
the
equal
protection
clause
essentially,
saying
that...
that...
that
there
must
be
constitutionally
or
by
virtue
of
this...
of
this
supposedly
constitutionally
remedially
statute,
there
must
be
equal
treatment
of...
of
handicapped
people.
and
it...
it
seems
to
me
it's
exactly
parallel
to
what
was
going
on
in...
in
boerne,
rewriting
the
first
amendment
versus
rewriting
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
we
looked
at
the
whole
sweep
of...
of
congress'
action,
not
just
at
the
particular
first
amendment
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
has
to
be
an
affirmative
offer?
he
could
not
have
asked
for
assistance
getting
up
the
stairs?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
constitutional
violation
not
to
offer
it
as
opposed
to
refuse
it
when
he
asks
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
he
appears
downstairs
and...
and
he
sees
one
of
the
constables
there
and
says,
you
know,
i
can't
make
it
upstairs
in
my
wheelchair,
could
i
have
assistance
get...
getting
upstairs?
now,
is
that
a...
is
that
a
constitutional
violation
not
to
have
an
elevator
for
him,
but
to
say,
you
know,
we'll...
we'll
see
that
you
are
carried
up
by...
by
constables?
is
that
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
understand
that.
it
is
because
the
presumption
is
that
somebody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
has
a
constitutional
right
for
the
state
to
provide
him
the
means
of
being
present
at
his
trial.
now,
does
the
means
have
to
be
an
elevator
or
could
it
be
someone
assisting
up
the
stairs?
now,
there...
it...
it
may
be
less
dignified
in
the
latter...
in
the
latter
situation,
and
that's
a
proper
subject
for
statutory
activity,
but
is
it
a
constitutional
violation,
so
long
as
the
state
assures
that
he
can...
he
can
be
present
at
his
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
neither
was
a
federal
judge
who
could
hear
his
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
federal
government
brings
a
lawsuit
or
he
brings
a
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
neither
one
of
them
is
there
instanter.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that...
that's
persuasive
or
not,
depending
on
what
was
meant
by
the
term
discrimination.
if
it
simply
meant
that...
that
the
handicapped
were
not
accommodated
by
special
provisions,
such
as
elevators,
that
might
be
quite
true,
but
it
would
also
not
be
a
constitutional
violation,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let...
let's
stay
on
your
first
one.
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
waiting
to
hear
what...
what
findings
congress
made
that
has
anything
to
do
with
constitutional
violations
by
the
states--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
the
premise
for
this
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
--these
two
sections...
these...
these
two
things
were
debated
and...
and
passed
simultaneously,
or
at
very
different
times?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
they're...
they're
using
discrimination
to
use
one
thing
in...
in
one
half
and
another
thing
in
the
other
half?
that's...
that's
what
you
want
to
argue
to
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
do
you
mean
by
turned
away?
turned
away
because
there
was
no
elevator?
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
that
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
tells
them--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we...
we
don't
have
an...
we
don't
have
an
elevator.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
want
to
get
up
to
vote,
you
have
to
find
assistance
to
get
up
there.
it's
very
bad,
and
this
legislation
is
directed
against
it,
and
can
remedy
it
upon
a
suit
by
the
united
states,
but
is
it
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
does
at
all.
inaccessible
voting
place
proves
nothing
at
all.
it
just
proves
that
the
state
did
not
go
out
of
its
way
to
make
it
easy
for
the
handicapped
to
vote,
as
it
should,
but
as
it
is
not
constitutionally
required
to
do.
to
simply
say
many
voting
places
are
inaccessible
proves
nothing
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
saying
you
can't
vote,
they're
saying
we
don't
have
facilities
for
you
to
get
to
the
voting
place.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
do
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
solve
that
problem
by
requiring
access
to...
to
state-owned
hockey
rinks
or
any
state-owned
buildings,
whether
it's
a
courthouse
or
anything
else.
i
mean,
you're...
you're
talking
about
it
as
though
all
congress
was
directing
this
legislation
at
was...
was
the
problem
of
people
getting
to
the
voting
place
or
the
problem
of
people
getting
to...
to
courthouses.
that's
not
how
the
legislation
reads.
it's
all
public
facilities
run
by
the
state,
hockey
rinks,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
there
are
no
conceivable
constitutional
rights
involved.
