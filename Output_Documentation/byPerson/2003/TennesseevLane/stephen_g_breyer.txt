justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the...
that's
what
i
want
to
get
to.
i...
i
mean,
to
put
the
whole
question
to
you,
i'm
assuming
we're
talking
here
to
use
the
statute
about
judicial
or
courthouse-related
services,
programs,
or
activities.
so
i
was
seeing
this
as
a
kind
of
as-applied
challenge,
and
if
it's
constitutional
in
this
area,
maybe
we
leave
the
other
areas
for
a
later
time.
now,
on
that
assumption,
as
you
well
know
and
i
do,
the
majority
criticized
my
appendix
in
garrett--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
certain
inadequacies.
and
among
those
inadequacies
which
it
highlighted
was,
one,
the
inadequacy
that
it
talked
about
public
employment
instead
of,
says
the
majority,
public
accommodations
and
public
services.
here
we're
talking
about
public
accommodations
and
public
services.
second,
the
majority
criticized
it...
i'm,
you
know,
aware
of
these
criticisms,
i
read
them
carefully.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the...
the...
criticized
it
because
the
senate
reports
hadn't
said
anything.
well,
here
the
committee
report
talks...
says
discrimination
still
persists
in
such
critical
areas
as
public
accommodations
and
public
services.
and
third,
the...
the
concurring
opinion
says
there
is
no
record
of
litigation
on
this
point
and
the
sg
has
filed
a
whole
brief
with
loads
of...
and
fourth,
the
majority
made
a
major
point
of
there
being
a
relaxed,
rational
basis
standard
of
judicial
review,
but
here
we
have
access
to
a
courthouse,
something
that
would
seem
to
call
for
more
strict
scrutiny
than
that.
all
right.
those
are
the
four
things
that
i
could
see
as
distinguishing
this
case,
and
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
ask
you,
why
don't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how
do
you
do
that?
because
if
i
think
of
the
antitrust
laws,
for
example,
or
other
congressional
statutes
in
olden
days
when
the
court,
you
know,
was
worried
about
the
scope
of
the
commerce
clause,
what
would
happen
is
they
would
say,
of
course
the
antitrust
law
is
valid,
the
statute's
valid,
but
it's
not
valid
to
apply
it
to
baseball,
because
baseball's
not
an
interstate
commerce,
or
it's
not
valid
to
apply
it
to
insurance.
well,
why
wouldn't
the
court
take
the
same
approach
here,
that
this
statute
may
be
valid
as
applied
to
x,
y,
and
z,
where
they
did
have
enough
evidence,
but
not
a,
b,
and
c,
where
they
didn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
out
of
curiosity,
in
your
view,
is
the
requirement
that
congress
have
a
kind
of
legislative...
i've
called
it
an
administrative
or
court
record...
to
document
the
evidence
of
unconstitutionality
of
practices
applicable
only
in
section
5
of
the...
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
or
is
something...
is
it
a
constitutional
requirement
that
applies
to
all
the
provisions
of
article
i,
including
the
commerce
clause
and
other
provisions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
like...
it's
like
a
mean
question,
because
if
you...
if
you
answered
the
question
that
they
had
to
be
different,
i'd
said
why,
and
if
you
answered
the
question
they'd
have
to
be
the
same,
each
of
us
can
cast
our
minds
over
dozens
of
pieces
of
important
legislation
where,
let's
say,
the
underpinning...
let's
take
the
copyright
clause
or
let's
take
any
one
of
a
dozen
where
there
isn't
really
much
of
a
legislative
record.
i
mean,
that's...
do
you
want
to
say
anything
about
that?
i
mean,
that's
the
problem
i
see
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you...
we
don't
have
to
just
say
this
one
individual,
do
we?
i
mean,
there
is
a
pretty
good
record
here.
i...
well,
i
better
not
characterize
it,
because
i
come
from
a
certain
point
of
view
on
this,
but
there's
a
pretty
good
record,
and
i
felt
the
chief
justice's
question
was
getting
to
this.
i
mean,
are
you
arguing
that
if
this...
this
statute
could
constitutionally
be
written
giving
you
constitutionally
this
lawsuit
as
a
remedy,
in
respect
to
your
client
that's
good
enough,
that
is
a
harder
argument
possibly
than
to
say,
well,
if
it's
valid
in
respect
to
the
general
problem
of
providing
judicial
services,
which
is
a
big
category,
one
whole
branch
of
the
state.
i
mean,
that
category
might
be
valid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
probably
this
is
universally
accepted
what
you're
saying,
and
what
i
wonder
is,
is
why,
if
you
could
explain
it,
what
your
opponent
is
saying
is
that
to
give
people
a
remedy
for
the
violation
of
that
principle,
it
is
adequate
to
have
the
federal
government
bring
a
lawsuit
or
they
bring
an
ex
parte
young,
et
cetera,
action.
now,
why
isn't
that
sufficient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
begins
section
5
by
saying,
individuals
with
disabilities
continually
encounter
various
forms
of
discrimination,
including
outright
intentional
exclusion.
so
it
seems
to
want
to
deal
with
it
all.
