justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
the...
that
the
state...
and
it's
just
an
assumption...
would
concede
that
sovereign
immunity
could
be
abrogated
insofar
as
access
to
courthouses
for
handicapped
people,
so
that
congress
could
have
drafted
a
congruent
and
proportional
statute.
the
fact
that
this
injury
comes
within
a
statute
which
has
a
much
larger
coverage
is
grounds
for
striking
the
statute
down,
even
though
this
case
involves
what
we
will
assume
to
be
a...
an
injury
that
could
be
remedied
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
money
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
state
is
building
a
new
stadium,
a
new
hockey
rink.
does
it
have
a
constitutional
obligation
to
make
it
accessible
to
the
handicapped?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
the
government...
the
government's
position
is
citizens
don't
have
some
rights
of
access
to
public
facilities
as
a
matter
of
the
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is...
what
is
the
constitutional
right?
freedom
of
movement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the...
what
is
the
basis
for
the
constitutional
right
that
you
accepted
in
your
response
to
your
question...
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's...
there's
no...
there's
no
greater
right
to
freedom
of
movement
or
general...
on
the
part
of
citizens,
freedom
of
access
to
all
governmental
facilities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
your
position
whether
or
not
in
your
view
there
is
such
a
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
don't
have
a
position
on
the
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
