justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
can
understand
that
if
the
state
official
was
standing
at
the
door
saying,
no,
you
cannot
bring
a
wheelchair
in
here.
but
if
the
building
itself
simply
does
not
allow
for...
for...
for
ready
access,
how
would
an
ex
parte
young
action
be
a
source
of
remedy?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the...
if
the
activity...
the...
the
conduct
of...
of
the
business
of
courts
is
taking
place
in
a
courthouse,
i
think
that
gets
us
to
focus
on
the
building,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they're...
they're
saying,
look,
you...
you
could
have
an
ex
parte
order...
young
order...
saying
hold
court
on
the
first
floor.
that's...
that's
what
you're
getting
at?
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
that
under
ex
parte
young,
a
court
could
not
say
to
a
state
official,
build
an
elevator?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
would
as...
as
a
last
ditch,
you
would
concede
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
would
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
you
explain
to
me
the
difference
between
your
position
and
the
government's
position
then?
because
you've...
you've
gone
beyond...
at
least,
as
i
understand
your
answer,
you've
gone
beyond
a...
a
kind
of
a
strict,
as-applied
argument,
and...
and
i'm
not
sure
where
you
and
the...
and
the
government
part
company
at
this
point,
if
you
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
your
argument
still
that
what
you
are
complaining
of
would
independently
be
a
constitutional
violation,
so
that
the
virtue
of
this
act,
in
effect,
is
to
provide
a
remedy,
and
that's
all
we
need
to
consider?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're...
you're
saying
that
if
the
only
public
facility
without
a
ramp
was
a
hockey
rink,
you'd
have
a
tough
row
to
hoe,
but
if
every
public
facility,
courthouses,
schools,
et
cetera,
have
no
ramps,
then
you've
got
a
broader
context
and
you've
got
a
different
argument?
