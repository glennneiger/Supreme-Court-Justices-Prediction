mr.
moore,
does
tennessee
provide
any
cause
of
action
for
the
alleged
violations
here,
the
lack
of
access
to
the
courthouse?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you're
satisfied
that
under
tennessee
law,
there
would
be
no
monetary
relief
available?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
there
be
any
enforcement
action
at
all
available
to
compel
under
tennessee
law
the
courthouses
to
be
accessible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
title
ii,
even
if
this
court
were
to
find
monetary
damages
are
not
available,
is
there
a
way
to
enforce
title
ii
by
the
federal
government
against
the
state
of
tennessee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
what
power?
i
guess...
i
guess
you're
arguing
that
there's
no
section
5
authority--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
enactment
of
this
provision.
and
that
would
leave
what,
the
commerce
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
it
would
survive
the
commerce
clause
challenge,
do
you,
as
applied
to
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i'm
asking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
other
states
have
though,
have
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there...
do--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
what
i'd
like
to
get
at.
i...
i
have
the
impression
from
your
brief
that
you
were
suggesting
that
we
could
just
address
the
fundamental
rights
aspect
of
this
case
and
forget
about
the
rest,
but
you
seem
to
be
saying
now
that
we
should
consider
the
whole
thing
and
consider
it
all
valid
as
a
prophylaxis
proposition.
which
is
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
you're
proposing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
haven't
really
done
that
in
other
cases
of
this
type,
of
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states,
have
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
