justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
get
out
of
the
courthouse
area
of
the
case
for
a
minute.
the
government's
brief
contains
a
statement
that
in
1975,
approximately
one
million
disabled
students
were
excluded
entirely
from
the
public
school
system.
if
that
were
true,
and
if...
because
of
their
disability,
if
that
were
true,
would
that
constitute
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
my
next
question
is,
there's
nothing
in
the
record...
suppose
you
had
several
congressmen
who
said,
i'm
going
to
vote
for
this
statute
because
i'm
convinced
that
this
fact
is
true,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
hearings,
but...
but
it
definitely
motivated
the
voting
of
people
who
voted
for
this
statute,
could...
would
it
be
valid
in
that
fact,
that
situation?
or
do
we
have
to
have
evidence
in
a...
in
a
congressional
hearing
in
order
to
justify
a
congressional
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it...
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
true
then
that
in
a
case
like
this,
we
must
examine
legislative
history
in
order
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
hasn't
been...
i'm
assuming
it
hasn't,
but
it's
just
clear
that
the
congressmen
who
voted
for
the
statute
thought
it
was
true.
they
got
letters
from
their
constituents
and
acted
on
that
sort
of
information,
and
that...
but
that
can
never
be
sufficient
under
your
understanding
of
our
cases?
it
must
be
something
in
the
congressional
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
quite
correct?
isn't
it
true
that
under
section
5
they
prohibited
the
poll
tax
and
literacy
tests,
even
though
they'd
been
held
permissible?
they
were
not
unconstitutional,
they
were
prophylactic
measures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree
that
it's
not
essential
that
there
be
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
under...
i
really
don't
understand
one...
one
argument
that's
going
on.
i
don't
know
why
one
violation
wouldn't
be
enough
to
justify
congressional
action.
it
often
is
that
one...
one
incident
triggers
a
legislative
response.
why
wouldn't
one...
one
example
be
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about
the
hockey
example?
supposing
building
a
new
hockey
example,
the
architect
said
you
could
do
it
with
equal
cost,
providing
access
and
not
providing
access.
would
it
be
constitutional
assuming
there's
no
extra
expense
to
provide
no
access?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
the
general
manager
of
the
hockey
team
doesn't
like
handicapped
people.
would
that
be
a
sufficient
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the...
he
has
two...
two
plans,
one
lets
them
in
and
one
doesn't,
and
the
manager
says,
oh,
we
don't
want
these
people,
they're
too
much
trouble
to
handle
for
the
ushers
when
they
get
them
in
their
seats
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
be
a
sufficient
rational
basis
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
cleburne
case
was
a
minimal
rational
basis
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
tennessee
against
lane.
respondents
are
paraplegics
who
use
wheelchairs
for
mobility.
they
claim
that
the
state
of
tennessee
has
failed
to
provide
them
with
reasonable
access
to
several
county
courthouses.
they
have
filed
suit
against
the
state
and
a
number
of
its
counties
pursuant
to
title
ii
of
the
american
with
disabilities
act,
which
forbids
public
entities
from
discriminating
against
persons
with
disabilities
in
the
administration
of
public
services.
they
sought
both
money
damages
and
equitable
relief.
the
state
moved
to
dismiss
the
suit
invoking
the
state’s
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
private
suits
for
money
damages.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion.
while
the
case
was
pending
on
appeal,
this
court
issued
its
decision
in
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
of
alabama
against
garrett
which
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
private
suits
for
money
damages
under
title
i
of
the
ada,
the
title
that
prohibits
employment
discrimination
against
the
disabled.
garrett
left
opened
the
question
whether
suits
for
money
damages
are
permitted
under
title
ii.
in
answering
that
question
in
this
case,
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
did
not
bar
respondent’s
suit.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm.
it
is
well
settled
that
congress
can
abrogate
eleventh
amendment
immunity
when
it
acts
pursuant
to
its
authority
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
enforce
the
substantive
guarantees
of
that
amendment.
the
primary
question
in
this
case
is
whether
title
ii
constitutes
a
valid
exercise
of
congress
section
5
power.
in
garrett,
we
held
that
title
i
was
not
a
valid
section
five
enforcement
legislation
because
its
broad
remedial
scheme
was
insufficiently
targeted
to
remedy
or
prevent
constitutional
violations.
we
concluded
that
disability
based
classification
are
valid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
they
bare
a
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
government
purpose
and
if
the
states
were
not
engaging
in
a
pattern
of
irrational
employment
discrimination
against
the
disabled.
title
ii
differs
from
title
i
in
several
respects.
whereas
title
i
aims
primarily
at
employment
discrimination
in
the
private
sector,
title
ii
aims
that
the
whole
range
of
public
services
in
the
public
sector.
most
important,
it
seeks
to
enforce
not
only
the
constitutional
prohibition
on
an
irrational
discrimination
but
also
a
number
of
other
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
infringements
of
these
rights,
including
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts,
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
are
subject
to
a
heightened
standard
of
judicial
review.
moreover,
congress
had
ample
reason
to
think
that
legislative
action
was
needed
to
remedy
or
prevent
violation
of
these
rights.
judicial
decisions,
the
legislative
records,
congressional
hearing
testimony,
and
anecdotal
evidence,
all
describe
a
pattern
of
pervasive
unequal
treatment
of
the
disabled
in
the
administration
of
public
services
and
programs
including
the
systematic
deprivation
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
the
question
then
is
whether
title
ii
is,
in
the
language
of
this
court’s
section
5
cases,
a
congruent
and
proportional
response
to
this
pattern
of
discriminatory
treatment.
title
ii,
unlike
other
statutes
we
have
reviewed
for
validity
under
section
five,
does
not
seek
to
enforce
just
one
constitutional
provision
but
reaches
a
wide
array
of
official
conduct
in
an
effort
to
enforce
an
equally
wide
array
of
constitutional
rights.
we
therefore
go
no
further
than
the
precise
question
that
this
case
presents.
whether
title
ii
appropriately
enforces
the
constitutional
right
have
access
to
the
court?
we
hold
that
it
does.
title
ii
requires
public
entities
to
make
reasonable
modifications
to
permit
persons
with
disabilities
to
participate
in
judicial
proceedings.
this
duty
to
make
reasonable
accommodations
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
well-establish
principle
that
states
must
afford
all
individuals
a
meaningful
right
to
be
heard
in
court.
so,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joined:
justice
ginsburg
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
and
justice
breyer
joined;
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
kennedy
and
justice
thomas
joined;
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
also
filed
dissenting
opinions.
