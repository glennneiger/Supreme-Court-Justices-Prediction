but
that
would
still
be
commerce
clause-based,
right?
because
you're
excluding
the
fourteenth
amendment
altogether.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
is
something
strange
about
that,
given
that
it
was
congress'
purpose
to
enable
people
to
exercise
the
rights...
the
full
rights
of
citizenship.
i
mean,
it's
a
kind
of
a
dignity
right
that
congress
was
recognizing,
and
it
doesn't
fit
as
comfortably
under
the
commerce
clause,
does
it,
as
it
would
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
brown,
are
you
saying
that
these...
what
fits
within
this
statute
would
independently
violate
the
constitution,
and
all
that
the
statute
does
is
provide,
in
this
case,
a
damage
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
in...
in
all
the
cases
that
would
fit
under
this
legislation,
someone
could
come
in,
say,
and
seek
injunctive
relief--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's
take,
say,
it's
a...
it's
a
seat
in...
in
a
public
stadium,
which
is
also
covered,
or
a
theater,
and
it's
inaccessible
to
certain
people
with
disabilities,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
for
which
this
statute
provides
a
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
a
difference,
though,
if
you
talk
about
non-discrimination,
say,
with
respect
to
race
or
religion,
you...
you
use
the
word
dignity
to
say
the
state
has
to
respect
the
dignity
of
every
human
being,
but
to
respect
the
dignity
of
certain
people
with
disability,
the
state
has
to
do
more
than
not
harm
them,
not
discriminate
against
them.
it
has
to
have
a
kind
of
affirmative
action
that's
permanent,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
the
point
that
i'm
making.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
point
is
that
sometimes
to
respect
the
equal
dignity
of
a
person,
we
have
to
treat
them
specially,
and
i
think
that
that's
what
the
elevator
is.
it
is
special
for
a
class.
it
isn't
the
same
as
everybody
else
has.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
reason
why
there's
a
damage
remedy
in
title
ii
and
not
in
title
iii?
