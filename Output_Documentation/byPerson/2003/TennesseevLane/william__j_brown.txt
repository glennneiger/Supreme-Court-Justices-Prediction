mr.
william
j.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
garrett
and
kimel,
and
entirely
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
hibbs,
title
ii
as
applied
to
the
case
that
is
before
the
court
today
presents
a
constitutional
application
of
the
powers
of
congress
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
j.
brown
your
honor,
please,
i
think
the
history
that
this
court
has
used
in
the
past
is
to
focus
on
the
case
and
the
circumstance
and
the
issue
that's
before
the
court.
the
case
that's
before
the
court
involves
the
fundamental
right
of
access
to
the
court.
mr.
william
j.
brown
respectfully,
chief
justice,
the
way
that
i
took
boerne
was
that
this
court
made
a
direct
statement
to
congress
that
they
had
overstepped
their
bounds
in
interpreting
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
its
applications.
the
court
looked
directly
at
congress
and
said
not
that
in
these
particular
circumstances,
but
on
this
particular
constitutional
issue,
you
went
too
far.
now,
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
today
is
not
about
whether
or
not
congress
dealt
with
a
fundamental
right.
that's
unquestionable.
today
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
what
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
is
the
quintessential
element
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
is
the
right
of
each
of
us
as
individuals
to
due
process
of
law,
to
life,
liberty,
and
property.
mr.
william
j.
brown
justice
scalia,
respectfully,
congress
does
not
have
a
real
good
record
of
writing
memorandum
opinions.
what
it
said
specifically
was,
this
law
deals
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
what
the
statute
says
is
that
citizens,
qualified
citizens
for
programs
and
services
and
activities
of
the
state,
have
a
right
to
participate
in
those
activities
without
having
the
onerous
issue
of
their
disability
come
into
play.
mr.
william
j.
brown
i
think
it
does.
mr.
william
j.
brown
well,
absolutely.
mr.
william
j.
brown
well,
the
beauty
of
title
ii
is
that
we
don't
have
to
chase
all
those
rapids.
i
mean,
title
ii
gave
me
the
benefit
of
a
trial
lawyer
in
tennessee
whose
sole
purpose
and
interest
was,
one,
to
make
sure
that
our
courthouses
in
tennessee
were
accessible,
and
two,
that
individuals
that
were
harmed,
that
suffered
pain,
embarrassment,
humiliation,
as
they
individually,
on
their
own,
by
virtue
of
their
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
represent
themselves
had
to
crawl
up
the
stairs
of
one
of
our
courthouses--
mr.
william
j.
brown
--it
may
not
provide
or
deal
with
a
constitutional
violation,
but
it
certainly
deals
with
a
prophylaxis
issue.
and...
and
let
me
give
you
this
example.
suppose
there
was
a
political
rally
in
that
stadium,
suppose
the
president
came
to
address
a
large
audience
of
individuals
in
that
particular
stadium,
and
those
individuals
who
have
mobility
disabilities
decided
that
they
wanted
to
go
and
hold
up
a
sign
that
says,
mr.
president,
make
our
buildings
accessible.
is
that
not
really
a
fundamental
first
amendment
right,
and
the
fact
that
they
can't
get
there
implicates
their
right
to
petition
their
government?
the
concept
that
we
as
individuals
have
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
be
citizens
in
all
of
its
aspects,
not
just
simply
in
one
context
that
may
or
might...
may
not
ever
come,
surely
today
in
the
year
2004,
congress
has
the
power
to
ensure
that
we
as
individuals
have
all
the
rights
of
citizenship
without
reference
to
any
individual
context.
mr.
william
j.
brown
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
william
j.
brown
your
honor,
i
represent
six
people
in
tennessee
who
are
trying
to
get
access
to
the
courts
of
our
state.
if
i
can
win
their
cause,
then
i
will
be
satisfied
with
the
results
that
i
initiated
in
1998
when
i
filed
this
lawsuit.
if
i
have
a
responsibility
to
go
broader
and
to
defend
all
the
other
aspects
of
title
ii,
but
lose
my
clients'
case,
then
i
have
not
done
them
a
service,
nor
have
i
done
a
service
to
other
individuals
who
are
seeking
access.
mr.
william
j.
brown
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
brown
let
me
say,
your
honor,
respectfully,
i
think
we
do
have
to
establish
a
category.
i
don't
think
that
title
ii
nor
this
court
would
ever
suggest
that
literally
every
person
who
comes
in
with
a
title
ii
claim
has
to
state
a
constitutional
violation,
because
then
it
takes
away
from
the
prophylaxis
benefits
of
title
ii.
what
is
says,
what
title
ii
fundamentally
says,
and
literally
adopts
what
i
think
is
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
back
to
what
i
said
before.
we
as
individuals
have
a
right
to
be
there
where
our
government
works
and
where
it
operates.
and
george
lane
is
a
classic
example
of
that.
george
lane
confronted
as
an
individual
with
a
misdemeanor
charge,
a
driving
on
a
revoked
license
case,
the
proposition
that
the
only
way
he
could
get
to
the
courtroom
where
his
liberty
was
at
stake
was
by
crawling.
the
state
suggests
there
were
alternatives.
where
were
the
people
offering
to
carry
him
up
the
stairs
the
first
time?
where
were
they?
mr.
william
j.
brown
your
honor--
mr.
william
j.
brown
--your
honor,
please.
mr.
william
j.
brown
i
think
that
it
is,
your
honor,
because
the
presumption
is
that
somebody
would
be
there
to
carry
him.
mr.
william
j.
brown
there
is
no
constitutional
right...
if
he
doesn't
have
a
constitutional
right
generally
to
get
there,
what
gives
him
the
constitutional
right
to
have
somebody
carry
him
up
there?
you're
asking
what
george
lane
to
rely
on--
mr.
william
j.
brown
--his
safety,
your
honor,
is
a
critical
issue.
ralph
ramsey,
who
is
one
of
my
clients,
weighs
350
pounds.
to
say
that
he
has
a
constitutional
expectation
that
one
or
two
or
five
or
the
whole
battalion
of
deputy
sheriffs
in
cocke
county
would
and
could
carry
him
up
those
stairs,
i
mean,
what's
he
going
to
do,
file
a
federal
lawsuit
to
make
sure
that
somebody
will
carry
him
up
there?
i
don't
think
he
has
that
right.
what
he
has
is
the
prophylaxis
benefit
of
a
law
that
says
we're
going
to
create
buildings
where
people
can
gain
access
to
their
rights
as
citizens.
that
is
as
important
to
say
as
it
is
to
say
that
we
all
have
a
right,
no
matter
what
our
circumstances,
our
background,
our
class,
to
get
to
the
civic
center
of
life,
public
life
in
our
communities,
and
that
should
be
done,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
know
that
you
all
have
ever
said
that,
but
that
should
be
done
with
dignity
and
respect
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
speaks
about
all
of
us
as
individuals.
and
today
i
think
that
is
what
is
so
important
and
at
stake.
this
case
is
not
just
about
individuals
with
disabilities.
mr.
william
j.
brown
your
honor,
please,
the
federal
government
was
not
there
the
day
george
lane
confronted
those
stairs.
george
lane
could
not
call
upon
the
federal
government
that
day
to
ensure
that
he
didn't
go
to
jail
because
he
refused
to
crawl
those
stairs.
mr.
william
j.
brown
and
that's
why
the--
mr.
william
j.
brown
--that's--
mr.
william
j.
brown
--respectfully,
your
honor,
that
is
why
title
ii
is
there,
to
make
the
state
of
tennessee
anticipate
that
problem,
solve
that
problem,
so
our
citizens
don't
have
to
confront
those
obstacles
and
face
pain,
suffering,
and
public
humiliation
as
a
condition
of
citizenship.
respectfully,
your
honor,
please,
this
deals
again,
as
i
have
said,
not
just
with
the
rights
of
disability
individuals,
but
the
rights
of
all
of
us
to
go,
to
petition
our
government,
to
have
a
right
to
represent
ourselves
in
a
court
of
law.
mr.
william
j.
brown
respectfully,
justice
ginsburg,
an
elevator
to
an
individual
with
disabilities
is
no
different
than
stairs
are
to
me
as
a
person
without
disabilities.
it's
the
way
i
get
there.
the
fact
that
i
happen
to
have
an
opportunity
to
walk
upstairs
doesn't
make
those
accommodations
any
different
to
me
than
it
is
with
an
individual
with
disabilities.
the
point
of
the
matter
is,
suppose
as
in
meigs
county,
where
you've
got
a
stairway
getting
to
the
second
floor
that
barely
one
person
can
climb
up,
it's
creaky,
i
mean,
are
we
going
to
say
if
they
shut
down
those
stairs,
we
can
haul
people
up
with
a
pulley
and
a
rope?
mr.
william
j.
brown
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
brown
your
honor,
i
think
the
word
special
accommodation
is
something
that
is
a
problem.
i...
i
hope
the
court
will
understand
that--
mr.
william
j.
brown
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
