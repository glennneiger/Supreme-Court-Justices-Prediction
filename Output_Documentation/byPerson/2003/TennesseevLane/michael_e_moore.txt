mr.
michael
e.
moore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
whether
the
court
chooses
to
view
title
ii
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
in
the
entirety
of
its
indiscriminate
application
through
every
facet
of
every
state
program,
activity,
and
service,
or
in
the
alternative,
as
the
private
respondents
urge,
in
the
narrow
courthouse
access
context,
presented
by
the
particular
allegations
of
the
complaint
they
have
filed
in
this
case,
the
court
should
conclude
that
title
ii
exceeds
congress'
enforcement
authority
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
essentially
two
reasons.
first,
because
there
was
no
evidence
before
congress
that
the
states
were
involved
in
a
widespread
pattern
of
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
disabled
persons
when
the
ada
was
enacted
in
1990.
and
second,
because
title
ii
shares
all
of
the
incongruent
and
disproportionate
features
that
proved
fatal
to
title
i
of
the
same
statute
in
the
garrett
case
and
then
some.
title
ii's
lack
of
congruence
and
proportionality
to
any
identified
constitutional
injury
inflicted
upon
disabled
persons
by
the
states
is
apparent,
we
say,
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
congress
made
no
effort
to
tailor
its
provisions
to
those
contexts
which
might
conceivably
pose
a
threat
to
the
exercise
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights
by
individuals
with
disabilities.
instead,
title
ii
applies
indiscriminately
to
every
service,
program,
or
activity
of
the
states.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
your
honor's
question
focuses
on
a
debate
that
we
really
haven't
engaged
in.
it's...
it's
one
between
the
respondents
and
the
united
states,
because
in
our
view,
whether
the
court
views
the
statute
in
its...
in
overall
operation,
or
as
focused
narrowly
on
the
courthouse
access
context,
either
analysis
leads
to
the
same
conclusion.
having
said
that,
i
would
say
that
the
prohibition
of
title
ii
is
a
single,
unitary,
very
elegant
one-sentence
prohibition
in
section
12132
of
title
42.
it
doesn't
purport
to
subdivide
the
statute...
the
statute's
prohibitions
into
particular
subject
matter
areas.
and
as
the
united
states
points
out
in
its
brief,
this
court's
prior
congruence
and
proportionality
cases
in...
in
the
abrogation
context
suggest
that
the
court
looks
usually
at
the
overall
operation
of
the
statute.
if
the
court
chooses
that
perspective
on
this
problem,
we
think
yes
indeed,
even
if
the
statute,
assuming
the
statute,
a
narrowly-tailored
statute
could
have
been
drafted
that
would
validly
abrogate
sovereign
immunity
in
the
courthouse
access
context,
title
ii's
flaw
is
that
it
is
not
so
targeted.
in
fact,
of
the
myriad
activities
it
covers,
your
honor,
a
very
small
percentage
conceivably
implicate
the
exercise
of
any
constitutional
right.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no
private
right
of
action
under
our
state
public
buildings
act.
our
state
public
buildings
act,
your
honor,
was
enacted
in
1970.
it
applied
to
all
buildings
constructed
on
or
after
that
date.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
think
that
is...
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no,
your
honor,
because
under
tennessee
law,
the...
the
injunction
to
build
fully
accessible
buildings
applies
to
buildings
constructed
after
the
enactment
of
the
public
buildings
act
in
1970.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
public
buildings
act
requiring
retrofitting.
but,
of
course,
in
this
case,
tennessee
does
not
dispute
its
obligation
to
comply
with
title
ii,
and
we
do
not
dispute
that
our
state
officials
can
be
called
to
account
for
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
title
ii
in
an
ex
parte
young
action.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor,
there
is,
in
an
enforcement
action
by
the
united
states,
injunctive
relief
and
monetary
damages
would
be
available
against
the
state.
in
addition--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
your...
your
honor,
of
course,
this...
this
case
doesn't
present
that
question.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
but--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--but
we
have
not
challenged
and
do
not
question
congress'--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i...
it's
my
understanding
that
that
claim
has
been
raised
in
certain
lower
federal
courts,
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
title
ii
doesn't
really
apply
to
buildings.
it
applies
to
services,
programs,
and
activities,
and
so
long
as
they--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--but
so
long
as
the...
so
long
as
the
court
in
question
offers
the
service
in...
in
a...
in
another
venue,
for
example,
as
occurred
in
this
case,
mr....
at
every
step
of
mr.
lane's
interaction
with
the
polk
county
criminal
court,
an
accommodation
was
offered
to
him,
albeit
it
was
rejected.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the...
i...
i
should
think
a...
a
court
could
fashion
whatever
remedy
is...
is
deemed
appropriate
to
ensure
that
a...
a
person
in
mr.
lane's
circumstance
enjoys
the
full
panoply
of
his...
of
his
constitutional
rights
in...
in--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--well,
i
think
courts
have
wide
discretion
to
fashion
injunctive
relief
in
ex
parte
young
actions,
and
if,
in
a
particular
circumstance,
that
were
the
only
reasonable
way
of
delivering
the
service,
i...
i
think
that
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes.
i
think...
i
think
in
an
ex
parte
young
action,
courts
have
enormous
discretion
to
fashion
equitable
relief
that
is
appropriate
to...
to
whatever
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
are
presented--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--that
would
be
true,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
think
it
fits
quite
comfortably
under...
under
the
commerce
clause,
your
honor.
but,
of
course,
under
this
court's
case
law,
in
order
to
invoke
its
section
5
power,
congress
had
to
have
evidence
before
it
or
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
states
were
engaged
in
a
widespread
pattern
of
violating
the
constitutional
rights
of
disabled
or...
or...
of...
of
whatever
group
is
involved,
and
here
there
was
no
such
evidence,
certainly
not
in
the
courthouse
access
context.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
they
don't,
your
honor.
let
me
take
each
one
in
turn.
first
of
all,
in
the
appendix
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
indeed,
if
the
court
will
look
at
all
of
the
hundreds
of
pages
of
briefs
filed
in
this
case
by
respondents
and
their
amici,
the
court
will
not
find
a
single
case
from
a
single
jurisdiction
that
has
held
that
anytime,
anywhere
in
the
united
states,
a
person's
fundamental
constitutional
rights
of
access
to
the
courts
has
been
denied
as
the
result
of
architectural
barriers
at
courthouses.
and
if
there's
one
context
in
which
one
would
expect
to
find
case
law,
it
is
in
the
courthouse
access
context,
because
after
all,
the
business
that
takes
place
there
is
litigation.
we
think
that
is
a
particularly
telling
point.
similarly,
in...
we
find
in
the
government's
brief,
who
has...
the
government
has
called
from
your
honor's
appendix
the
pertinent
entries,
and
we
find
eight
of
them
that
have
sufficient
detail
that
would
permit
one
to
actually
ask
the
question,
was
a
constitutional
violation
involved?
and
we
say
that
under
the...
even
the
most
creative
interpretation
of
any
of
them,
they
don't
make
out
a
constitutional
violation.
all
of
the
other
references
to
courthouses
in
appendix
c
to
your
honor's
opinion,
we've
pulled
every
single
of
them,
and
they
simply...
they
simply
label
courthouse
facilities
as
inaccessible.
but,
of
course,
under
the
ada,
inaccessible
is
a
term
of
art.
it
doesn't
mean
there's
literally
a
wall
around
the
building
and
no
one
can
get
in.
it
means
that
they
are
inaccessible
in
the
sense
that
the...
the
amenities
required
by
the
ada
are
not
present,
so
that
there
are
not...
there
is
no
evidence
before
this
court,
and
there
was
no
evidence
before
congress,
that
anyone's
constitutional
rights,
rights
of
access
to
the
courts,
were
being
violated
as
the
result
of
the
existence
of
these
architectural
barriers.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
don't
think
the...
the
so-called
task
force
report,
which
is
summarized
in
the
appendix
to
your
honor's
dissent
in
garrett,
helps
the
respondents.
there
is
no
mention
in
the
text
of
the
act
itself,
of
course,
of
courthouse
access,
and
if
one
looks
at
the
senate
and
house
reports
on
the
legislation,
one
will
discover
that
there
is
not
a
single
mention
of
the
subject
anywhere
and
no
other
indication
that
congress
thought
courthouse
access
was
a
matter
of
particular
concern.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that...
that
the
court's
prior
abrogation
cases,
each
one
of
them
looks
at
the
overall
operation
of
the
statutory
scheme
and
does
not
look
at
its
application
in
a
context-by-contact...
context
basis.
and
we
would
agree
that
if
the
court
chooses
to
continue
that
practice
and...
and
for
many
of
the
reasons
discussed
in
the
united
states
brief,
we
think
that
is
probably
the
better
view
of
it,
this
statute
clearly
falls,
because
under
no
circumstances
can...
can
one
say
that
it...
it...
it
is
congruent
and
proportional
to
a
valid,
remedial
objective.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i...
because
i
think
the
abrogation
inquiry
is
fundamentally
different.
the
abrogation
inquiry
focuses
on
whether
congress
invoked
its
power
under
section
5
in
a
fashion
that
is
congruent
and
proportional
with
a
valid,
remedial
objective,
that
being
a...
a...
an
identified
pattern
of
unconstitutional
behavior.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
and
in
order
to...
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
that's
true.
that's
true,
and...
and
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
kimel
case.
the
court
didn't
focus
on
the
peculiar
allegations
of
the
complaint
in
that
case.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
the
statute
lacks
congruence
and
proportionality
also,
not
just
because
of
its
sheer
breadth,
which
justice
scalia's
question
highlights,
but
also
because
in
the
myriad
contexts
to
which
it
applies,
it
imposes
obligations
on
the
state
that
go
far
beyond
what
the
constitution
itself
commands.
it
really
does
so
in
two
ways
generally.
first,
most
of
the
rules
under
title
ii
promulgated
by
the
justice
department
to
enforce
its
provisions
require
states
to
modify
otherwise
disability-neutral
policies
and
practices
in
order
to
eliminate
adverse,
disparate
effects
those
policies
may
have
on
the
interests
of
disabled
persons,
whereas,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
garrett
case
itself,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
disparate...
disparate
effects
of
that...
those
sorts,
without
more,
do
not
make
out
any
sort
of
constitutional
violation.
second...
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
don't
think
we
have
enough
facts
to
draw
any
conclusion.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
think
there
must
be
evidence
of
a
pattern
of
constitutional
violations,
and
merely
saying
that
a
particular
class
of
persons
is
excluded
from
public
schools,
for
example--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--without
more
information
doesn't
permit
a
conclusion
necessarily
that
a
constitutional
violation
is
going
on.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
unless...
i
mean,
there
are
certain
contexts
where...
where
the...
the
history
of
discrimination
is
so
well
known
and
has
been
documented
in
this
court's
own
opinions,
that
perhaps
that's
unnecessary.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
think
there
must
be
something
in
the...
in
the
record
that
establishes
a
state...
state
participation
in
a
widespread
pattern
of
unconstitutional
behavior,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
the...
the...
and
in
fact--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i...
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
only--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i
think
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
the
only
context
in
which
this
court
has
applied
heightened
scrutiny
in...
in
the
education
context
is
where
there
was
a...
a...
a
punitive
class-based
exclusion,
and...
and
there
only
in
the
k
through
12
context,
and
so
merely
reciting
that
a
certain
number
of
students
were
being
excluded
without
more
information,
your
honor,
i
think
would
not
make
out
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
quite
frankly,
i
focused
only
on
this
court's
cases
construing
section
5
requirements
in
this
context.
but
i...
i
think...
i
think
congress...
when
congress
invokes
one
of
its
powers
in
a
way
that
intrudes
upon
the
sovereignty
of
the
states,
it
must
document
that
it
has
an
adequate
basis
in
fact
for
concluding
that
that
power
exists.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
well,
of
course,
here,
this
case
deals
with
a
specific
context,
the...
the...
the
invocation
of
congress'
power
to...
to
abrogate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity,
and
it
seems
entirely
reasonable
for
the
court
to
construe
section
5
as
requiring
that
before
the
congress
alters
the
federal-state
balance
in
such
a
grave
way,
that
it
document
very
carefully
its
basis
for
doing
so.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
but
that
was,
your
honor,
only
after
a...
a
well-documented
history
of
discrimination
and
discriminatory
application
of
those--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i...
i
think
there
must
be
evidence
of
a
pattern
of
a
unconstitutional
behavior.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
there
has
to
be--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
100
percent,
and
i
would
like,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
very
briefly,
the
type
of
discrimination
congress
was
referring
to
in
the
statement
of
findings
of...
and
purpose
of
the
act
itself
is
made
clear
if
the
court
examines
the
fifth
finding,
which...
which
tells
us
what
sort...
what...
what
concept
of
discrimination
was
in
congress'
mind
when
they
used
the
term
throughout
those
findings.
and
it
talks
about
not
just
outright
intentional
exclusion,
but
it
talks
about
discriminatory
effects
of
architectural,
transportation,
and
communication
barriers.
it
talks
about
overprotective
rules
and
policies
and
their
effects.
it
talks
about
failures
to
make
modifications
to
existing
facilities
and
practices,
and
exclusionary
standards
that
screen
people
out,
in
other
words,
an
another
disparate
impact
sort
of
conception
of
discrimination.
and
i
think
for
that
reason
one
can
reliably
conclude
that...
that...
that
congress
was
not
using
discrimination
in
the
sense
of
completely
arbitrary
and
irrational
discrimination
of
the
sort
that's
prohibited
by
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
respect
to
disabled
persons,
but
rather,
in
the
findings
and
purpose,
congress
makes
clear
that
it
is
addressing
a
very
real
social
problem,
one
that
needs
addressing,
but
one
that
does
not
arise
to
the
level
of
a...
a
widespread
pattern
of
constitutional
violations
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
right,
but
out...
of
course,
outright
intentional
exclusion
is
not
necessarily
unconstitutional
either
if
it
is
rationally
based,
with
respect
to
disabled
persons.
so
one...
the
use
of
the
term
discrimination--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--the
city
of
cleburne
case,
your
honor.
action
by
the
state
that
intentionally
and
expressly
classifies
on
the
basis
of
disability
is
subject
to
minimum
rational
basis
scrutiny,
and
in
the
examples
discussed
during
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
for
example,
the
hockey
rink
example,
i
mean,
one
impact
of
a
lack
of
ramps
or...
or--
mr.

moore
--i...
i
think
so,
depending
upon
if
there
were
other
reasons
for
doing
it.
if...
cost
isn't
the
only
factor
that
dictates
the
design
of
a
building.
it
might
be

mr.
michael

--your...
your
hypothetical
is
that
the
architect
expressly
designs
the
building
to

disabled

mr.
michael
e.
moore
your
honor's
question
posits
a
rational
basis
for
that
decision.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
that...
under
this
court's
minimum
rational
basis
jurisprudence,
yes,
it
would.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i...
i
know,
your
honor,
there...
there

been
a

scholarly
debate

as
a
lawyer
for
a
state,
we
must
take
what
the
court
said
at
face
value.
thank
you
very
much.
