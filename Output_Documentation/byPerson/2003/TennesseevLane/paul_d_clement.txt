mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
title
i
of
the
ada,
which
regulates
states
as
employers
and
treats
public
and
private
employers
alike,
title
ii
of
the
ada
focuses
on
states
and
state
governments
as
governments
in
their
distinct
role
as
providers
of
public
services.
as
a
result,
congress
focused
specifically
on
the
conduct
of
state
and
local
officials
rather
than
simply
extrapolating
from
the
experience
of
private
employers.
equally
important,
congress
in
the
statutory
findings
and
legislative
reports,
the
same
reports
this
court
found
lacking
in
the
garrett
case
because
they
did
not
include
specific
findings
of
public
sector
discrimination
in
employment,
those
same
findings
and
reports
found
persistent
discrimination
in
such
critical
areas
as
access
to
public
services
and
voting.
moreover,
as
this
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
brings
us
to
the
second
important
distinction
between
title
i
and
title
ii,
which
is
because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and...
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
again,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
problem
in
garrett,
when
this
court
saw
findings
of
discrimination
in
an
area
like
employment
discrimination,
that's
governed
by
rational
basis
review,
then
there's
very
little
reason
to
think
that
the
small
"d",
if
you
will,
discrimination
congress
found
resulted
in
unconstitutional
discrimination.
but
because
title
ii
focuses
on
government
services,
many
of
which
implicate
fundamental
rights,
there's
every
reason
to
believe
that
when
government...
when...
when
the
congress
found...
take
voting
for
example...
discrimination
in
voting,
that
they
were
actually
finding
unconstitutional
discrimination
in
voting,
because
voting
and
access
to
polling
places
triggers
fundamental
rights
and
heightened
scrutiny.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
the
hibbs
case,
when--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--title
i
and
title
ii?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they...
they
passed
at
the
same
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
whatever
way
they
were
using
discrimination,
i
think
that
that
finding
of
discrimination
is
going
to
be
much
more
likely
to
be
correlated
with
actual
constitutional
violations
in
an
area
that
implicates
fundamental
rights.
and
i
think
when
there's
a
specific
finding
in
the
text
of
the
legislation
itself
of
discrimination
in
voting,
i
think
it's
very
likely,
given
the
heightened
scrutiny
that
applies
to
voting--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in...
in
some
cases,
mr.
chief--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
say
the...
the
relevant
congressional
committee
heard
testimony
of
individuals
that
were
turned
away
from
the
voting
place
on...
on
election
day,
so
there
is
that
kind
of
evidence.
now,
i
can't
articulate
for
you
how
many
instances
of
that
there
were.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
turned
away
because
there
was
no
elevator,
turned
away
because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--if...
if
the
voting
official
tells
the
individual,
we...
you
can't
vote
here,
because
this--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--this
is
not
accessible--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
if
he
tells
them--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
i
think
maybe
you'd
need
to
know
more,
but
if
the
individual
in
the
polling
place
is
turning
people
away
because
of
their
disability
and
they're
not
offering,
don't
worry,
we
have
a
school
down
the
road
that
is
accessible,
that's
not
the
facts.
they're
saying,
you
can't
vote,
i'm
sorry,
we
don't
have
the
facilities.
i
think
that
would
state
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
testimony
of
individuals,
i
don't
have
the
exact
number,
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i...
i
think
it
was
anecdotal
evidence,
and
i
would
say...
i
mean,
to
give
you
a
feel
for
the...
the...
the
sort
of
order
of
magnitude,
in
the
state
task
force
reports
that
congress
authorized,
there
were
35
instances
of
inaccessible
voting
places.
now,
i
can't
tell
you
the
breakdown
of
how
many
of
those
involved
people
refused
at
the
door
and
how
many
of
those
involved
simply
physical
barriers.
but
i
do
think
it
shows
that
there
was
a
significant
problem
in
this
area.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
again,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
when
you
couple
an
inaccessible
voting
place
with
local
officials
who
are
saying,
you
can't
vote
today,
we
don't
have
any
facilities
for
you,
that
does
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
guess
i
fail
to
understand
the
difference
in
that
in
a
practical
way.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions,
in
areas
of
fundamental
rights,
it
is
simply
not
true
that
only
intentional
discrimination
of
the
kind
you
have
in
mind
would
violate
the
constitution.
in
the
access
to
court
context,
in
particular,
this
court's
decision
in
m.l.b.
against
s.l.j.
suggests
that
in
many
instances
in
order
to
avoid
unconstitutional
discrimination,
the
courts
have
to
waive
filing
fees
of
indigent
defendants
or
indigent
individuals
trying
to
provide
their
constitutional
right.
if
that's
true
in
areas
of
fundamental
rights,
it's
not
clear
why...
why
state
officials
don't
have
some
obligations
under
the
constitution
itself
to
make
accommodations
for
individuals
with
disabilities.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
i
think
one
example
might
be
enough,
especially
when
coupled
by
other
evidence
in
the
record
that
is
reinforcing
and
suggestive
of
the
problem,
especially
when
coupled
with
judicial
decisions
that
we
provide
in
appendix
a
of
our
brief.
if
you
put
all
that
evidence
together,
it's
clear
that
congress
was
reacting
to
a
real
problem
in
this
context.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
and
let
me
say
two
things
in
response.
first
of
all,
i
think
congress
was
entitled,
once
it
found
a
problem
in
areas
of
fundamental
rights,
to
say
that
it's
permissible
prophylaxis
to...
to
provide
a
remedy
for
a
broader
array
of
government
services.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
if
i
could
respond
to
that,
i
don't
think
it's
that
there's
no
conceivable
constitutional
rights
involved.
even
in
areas
that
don't
implicate
fundamental
rights,
this
court
itself
has
found
a
constitutional
violation
in
the
disability
context
in
a
case
like
cleburne.
and
i
think
if
congress
finds
that
states
are
engaging
in
unconstitutional
discrimination
in
areas
implicating
fundamental
rights,
that
may
lead
to
an
inference
that
they're
simply
not
turning
off
the
switch
when
they
get
into
other
areas.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
don't
think
standing
alone,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would,
and
i
think
i
would
defend
that
in
part
as
part
of
the
permissible
prophylaxis
of
the
statute.
if
i
could
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
guess--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
fairness,
justice
o'connor,
it's
both.
i
mean,
i'm
here
defending
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
but
i
also
think
it
would
be
fair
for
this
court
to
follow
the
practice
that
i
think
was
suggested
in
a
case
it
decided
called
united
states
against
raines,
and
focus
in
on
the
aspect
of
the
statute
that
is
constitutional,
that
is
valid,
and
that
would
be
fundamental
rights.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
have
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
we
pointed
that
out,
and
i
think
there
is
some
tension
between
the
proportionality
and
congruence
test
in
this
as-applied
mode
of
analysis.
but
i
do
think
the
raines
case
points
out--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
fair,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
simply
point
to
raines
because
raines
shows
that
there's
nothing
inherently
inconsistent
between
analyzing
a
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
or
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
piece
of
legislation,
an
as-applied
analysis.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
applied
both
to
state
actors
and
private
individuals.
and
in
a
case
in
which
it
applied
to
state
actors,
they
said,
we
may
have
some
concerns
about
whether
it
can
validly
apply
to
private
actors,
but
we're
going
to
uphold
the
statute
as
applied
to
state
actors.
and
in
the
same
way,
i
think
if
this
court
thinks
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
applied
to
fundamental
rights,
but
has
concerns
in
its
applications
to
non-fundamental
rights,
that
it
could,
in
effect,
decide
the
case
along
the
same
lines.
and,
of
course,
the
narrowest
ground
this
court
could
decide
the
case
on
would
be
to
simply
focus
on
access
to
the
courts.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
not
sure
that
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that
if
you
isolate
the
example
of
the
non-fundamental
right
and
ask
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
standing
alone
violates
the
constitution--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
they
have...
they
might
have
some
access
under
the
constitution
and
some
right.
i'm
not
sure
though
that
i'd
be
able
to
make
an
argument
that
that
constitutional
right
is
protected
by
something
more
than
that
rational
basis
review.
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
souter.
and
one
other
thing
i
think
that's
worth
bearing
in
mind
is
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in...
in...
in
the
hockey
ring
context?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
facility
in
particular.
i
think
in
the
access
to
the...
in...
in
trying
to
get
access
to
a
court,
it
would
be
access
to
the
courts.
in
trying
to
get
access
to
a
polling
place,
it
would
be
the
right
to
vote.
i
think
one
thing
i'd
like
to
emphasize
though
is
that
the...
that
title
ii--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i...
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
this
court
has
said
that
yet.
if
it's
interested
in--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
certainly
not
one
that
this
court
has
ever
articulated,
and...
and...
what
i
would
say
though
is
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
have...
it's
not...
it's
not
a
matter
i've
really
given
any
thought,
justice
kennedy.
i
apologize
for
that.
i
think
the
one
thing
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
title
ii
does
not
just
give
an
access
to
buildings,
it
doesn't
give
an
access
to
hockey
rinks.
it
gives
an
access
to
programs,
services,
and
activities,
and
in
many
cases,
it's
going
to
be
the
same
municipal
building
that
has
the
courthouse
in
it
as
well
as
other
non-fundamental
rights,
and
that's
exactly
a
good
illustration
of
why
title
ii
is
appropriate
prophylaxis,
because
by
making
the
municipal
building
accessible,
even
for
something
like
a
kiddie
concert
that
might
not
implicate
fundamental
rights,
you're
also
making
the
courtroom
in
the
same
building
accessible
to
individuals
who
have
a
constitutional
right
to
access
to
that
building.
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
with
respect
to
the
damages
remedy,
which
is
precisely
what
seems
to
be
the
gravamen
of
the
concern
of
the
state
here.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
this
is
not
a
situation
like
other
cases,
where,
if
the
court
strikes
this
down
as
inappropriate
section
5
legislation,
there's
going
to
be
lots
of
other
remedies.
the
state
provides
none
and
people
are
raising
constitutional
challenges
to
the
commerce
clause
legislation.
the
damages
remedy
that's
particularly
provided
in
title
ii
of
the
ada
is
provided
by
double
cross-reference.
title
ii
incorporates
the
remedies
available
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
which
in
turn
incorporates
the
remedies
available
under
title
vi.
those
remedies
are
entirely
judge-made,
and
as
the
thornburgh
amicus
briefs
points
out,
to
the
extent
that
those
remedies
are
the
gravamen
of
the
constitutional
concern,
their
judge-made
origins
gives
this
court
unique
flexibility
to
interpret
the
compensatory
damages
remedy
in
a
way
that
renders
the
statute
as
a
whole
constitutional.
broadly
speaking,
congress,
in
passing
this
statute,
found
a
real
problem
with
the
individuals
and
the
entities
that
are
responsible
for
protecting
the
civil
rights
of
everyone,
denying
the
rights
of
individuals
with
disabilities.
one
element
of
its
solution
was
the
element
of
compensatory
damages.
those
compensatory
damages
are
an
appropriate
response,
but
it
would
be
very
sad
if
that
one
element
of
the
statute
was
used
to
bring
down
the
entirety
of
title
ii,
given
that
it
remains
vitally
necessary
to
make
the
promise
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
a
reality
for
individuals
with
disabilities.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
there
is,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
one
thing,
i
think,
is
that
congress...
the
difference
in
remedies
between
title
ii
and
title
iii
reflects
two
things.
one,
it
reflects
a
judgment
that...
that
unconstitutional
action
by
a
state
is
worse
than
unconstitutional
action
by
a
private
entity.
