are
you

very
well.
mr.

we'll
hear
from

chief

rehnquist
well,
but
virginia
objects
on

restrict

of

it

chief

no.

we've...
in

chief

129
original,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
versus
the
state
of
maryland.
this
control
of
the
potomac
river
has
been
disputed
for
nearly
400
years
and
in
this
case,
we
consider
one
aspect
of
this
dispute.
the
fairfax
county
water
authority,
a
political
subdivision
of
virginia,
sought
a
permit
from
maryland
to
build
a
water
intake
structure
extending
725
feet
into
the
river
from
the
virginia
shore.
maryland
refused
to
issue
the
permit
for
four
years.
when
it
finally
did,
it
plays
restrictions
on
the
amount
of
water
that
the
authority
could
withdraw
from
the
river.
virginia
brought
this
action
under
our
original
jurisdiction
seeking
a
declaration
that
it
has
the
right
to
withdraw
water
and
build
improvements
from
each
shore
free
from
regulation
by
maryland.
we
referred
the
action
to
a
special
master
who
recommended
that
we
grant
the
relief
sought
by
virginia.
maryland
filed
exceptions
to
the
report
of
the
master
and
we
now
overrule
those
exceptions.
in
the
17th
century,
maryland
and
virginia
each
claim
sovereignty
over
the
river
under
conflicting
royal
charters.
this
dispute
is
governed
by
two
interstate
compacts
designed
to
settle
ownership
and
regulation
of
the
river.
the
compact
of
1785
and
the
black-jenkins
award
of
1877.
the
1785
compact
did
not
address
sovereignty
over
the
river.
among
other
things,
however,
it
granted
the
citizens
of
each
state
full
property
rights
in
the
land
adjoining
the
river,
with
all
the
emoluments
and
advantages
thereunto
belonging
as
they
put
it
and
the
privilege
of
building
improvements
from
the
shore.
we
hold
that
this
compact
preserved
the
riparian
rights
of
citizens
of
both
states,
subject
to
whatever
later
resolution
of
sovereignty
would
occur.
and
that
occurred
in
the
black-jenkins
award
of
1877.
that
award
recognized
maryland
as
the
owner
of
the
riverbed
up
to
the
low
watermark
on
the
virginia
shore.
at
the
same
time,
however,
the
award
stated
that
virginia
has
a
right
to
such
use
of
the
river
beyond
the
line
of
low
watermark
is
maybe
necessary
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
her
riparian
ownership.
we
hold
that
the
plain
language
of
the
award
grants
virginia's
sovereign
riparian
rights
and
the
river
is
subject
only
to
federal
common
law
and
the
limitations
contained
in
the
award
itself.
those
were
that
virginia
neither
impede
navigation
or
interfere
with
the
proper
use
of
the
maryland
river
by
maryland.
the
award
does
not
allow
maryland
to
regulate
virginia's
riparian
use
of
the
river.
if
it
had,
the
stated
limitations
would
have
been
entirely
unnecessary.
finally,
we
reject
maryland's
claim
that
virginia
lost
her
rights
under
the
award
by
acquiescing
in
maryland's
regulation
of
her
waterway
activities.
to
the
contrary,
virginia
vigorously
asserted
her
riparian
rights
into
negotiations
that
led
to
the
passage
of
the
water
resources
development
act
of
1976.
so
maryland's
exceptions
are
overruled,
the
relief
sought
by
virginia
is
granted,
and
the
special
master's
proposed
decree
is
entered.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion

which
justice
kennedy
