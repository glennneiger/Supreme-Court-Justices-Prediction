justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
not
if
you
get
the
rule
that...
that
you're
asking
for
here,
other
than
this
factor.
and
then
that
gets
back
to
the
question
i
want
to
ask
and
i
think
it
bears
on
what
you're
telling
justice
stevens.
can
you
tell
me
what
relevance,
what
weight,
what
significance
do
we
attach
to
an
earlier
unwarned
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
a
factor
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances?
is
that...
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
why
should
that
be?
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
underlying
your
position
is
that
you
want
us
to
say
that
there's
simply
more
likelihood
that
there's
going
to
be
a
statement
after
the
miranda
warning
if
there's
been
a...
for
your...
to
use
your
term,
a
systematic
interrogation
before.
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
the
empirical
data
to
say
that
the
defendant
would
be
more
likely
to
talk
after
he's
been
questioned
and
the
miranda
warning
comes
late.
is
that
what
is
behind
your...
your
argument?
and
if
so,
is...
is
that
something
on
which
we
can
act?
suppose
that
he
is
more
likely
to
give
a
statement
after
there's
been
a
systematic
interrogation.
so
what,
if
it's
not
coerced?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
what
we're...
so
what
we're
concerned
about
is
the
fact
of
coercion.
nothing...
nothing
more?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
talk
about
the...
as
a
general
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
all
we're
talking
about
is
the
risk
of
coercion,
or
are
we
talking
about
preserving
the...
the
integrity
of
miranda
by
not
circumventing
it,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
thought
miranda
was
only
concerned
with
coercion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
an
end...
as
an
end
result.
obviously,
it's
a
prophylactic
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
can
you
tell
me
why
that
is?
is
he
afraid
that
he'll
be
beaten...
or
she
in
this
case...
or
has
the
will
be
broken
down
so
that
the
decision
is
a
little
more
clouded
and...
and
it
would
have
been
clearer
to
the
person
if
the
warning
had
been
given
at
the
outset?
these
are...
these
are
matters
of
psychology
that
elstad
told
us
that
we
really
should
not
be
speculating
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
work
to
do
what?
to
coerce
or
to
persuade
or
something
else?
that's...
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
from
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
you
argue
that
once
you
know
what
questioning
is
like
for,
say,
an
hour
and
then
you
get
the
warning,
you
have
a
better
idea
of
whether
you
want
to
go
through
with
this
or
not?
again,
these
are
empirical
things
that
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
we're
qualified
to
judge.
maybe...
maybe
we
must.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
took
the...
we
took
the
case
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
or
not
oregon
v.
elstad
is...
is
abrogated
when
the
initial
failure
to
give
the
miranda
warnings
was
intentional.
i
mean,
we...
that's...
that's
what
we're
here
to
decide.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
the
question
presented
is
based
on
oregon
v.
elstad.
it
quotes
it.
is
the
rule
that
a
suspect
who
has
once
responded
to
an
unwarned
yet
uncoercive
questioning
is
not
thereby
disabled
from
waiving
his
rights?
i
mean,
that's...
that's
what
we're
here
to
decide.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
a
complete
answer
to
your
argument.
of
course,
you
can
have
an
initial
suppression
motion
before
the
court.
i...
i
see
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
course,
your
argument
would
still
be
the
same
if
this
was
all
coercive,
and
to
the
extent
the
statements
are
repetitive,
it's
just
cumulative.
i...
i
do
see
your
point.
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question...
and
then
we
got
off
on
some
other
matters...
opposing
counsel...
justice
stevens
said,
well,
why
won't
police
do
this
all
the
time
and
why
would
they
have
the
incentive
to
make
this
standard
procedure?
and
the
answer
i
thought
was
that
if
you're
going
to
waive
your
rights,
you're
going
to
waive
your
rights,
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
but
that
seems
to
me
to
actually
help
your
side.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
the
answer
is
if
they're
going
to
waive,
they're
going
to
waive,
then
there's
no
reason
why
not
they
don't
give
the
warning
at
the
outset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
justice
scalia's
question,
if
you
have
the
officer
in
good
faith
makes
a
mistake,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
defendant?
