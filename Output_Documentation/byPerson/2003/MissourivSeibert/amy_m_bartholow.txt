ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
get
directly
to
what
justice
souter
just
mentioned,
that
when
there's
a
systematic
interrogation,
things
are
different.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
well,
i
think
what
elstad
said
and
why
this
situation
is
so
much
different
from
elstad
is
that
it
cited
cases
where
there
had
been
a
systematic
interrogation
where
there
was
a
deliberate
elicitation
of
questions--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--when
police
officers
deliberately
elicit
incriminating
statements
from
a
suspect,
then--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--i
don't
believe...
i
don't
believe
time
is
the
critical
factor.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
not
in
all
circumstances,
and
i...
i
think
sometimes,
especially
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
said
there's
a
risk
to
this
practice.
for
instance,
when
officers
engage
in
this
practice
to
locate
physical
evidence,
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
problem
for
the
missouri
supreme
court.
but
in
elstad,
this
court
cited,
for
instance,
united
states
v.
pierce
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
for
the
proposition
that
the
more
in
the
without
more
test
of
elstad...
the
more
would
be
a
thorough
custodial
interrogation
at
the
station
house.
that
would
provide
more,
where
there's
a
simple
failure
to
administer
warnings
without
more--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--well,
your
honor,
the...
in
elstad,
this
court
cited
westover
which
the
cardinal
fact
of
westover,
as
you
said
in
mosley,
was
that
the
failure
of
police
officers
to
give
any
warnings
whatsoever
to
the
person
in
custody
before
embarking
on
an
intense
and
prolonged
interrogation
of
him
would
result
in
coercion.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
i
think
in
this
case
you
have
coercion,
but
i
think--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--no.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
all
of
those.
i
think
you're
concerned
about
the
risk
of
coercion.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
no.
the...
miranda
was--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--miranda
was
certainly
concerned
about
the
risk
of
compelling
statements
being...
and
also
being
admitted
at
trial.
that
was
a
main
concern
of
miranda.
but
i...
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
the
waiver
was
voluntary
and
whether
the
second
statement
was
voluntary
and
the
risk
of
subjecting
a
suspect
to
lengthy,
intense
custodial
interrogation.
we
cannot
presume
that
the
waiver
and
subsequent
statement
was--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--well,
miranda...
and
in
dickerson
it
cited
this
portion
of
miranda
where
it
said
custodial
interrogations
by
their
very
nature
generate
compelling
pressures
which
work
to
undermine
the
individual's
will
to
resist
and
compel
him
to
speak
when
he
wouldn't
otherwise
do
so
freely.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we're
worried
about
suspects
being
coerced
and
compelled
into
giving
statements
that
aren't
according
to
their
free
will.
we're--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--both.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
well,
the
first
statement
is
automatically
excluded
pursuant
to
miranda.
the
reason
why
we
need
to
exclude
the
second
statement
as
well
is
because
by
using
the
first
statement,
by
referring
back
to
the
first
statement,
also
by
pressuring
the
waiver
to
get
the
second
statement,
it's
not
as
clear
as
it
would
normally
be
that
the
second
statement
is
voluntary
after
the
suspect
has
been
subjected
to
the
lengthy
interrogation
before.
i
mean,
police
officers
wouldn't
roll
the
dice
if
they
knew
it
didn't
work.
this
officer
had
used
this
tactic
for
8
to
10
years
because
he
knows
it
works.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
well,
it
undermines
the
free
will.
it's...
it...
the
tactic
is
used
to
prevent
the
exercise
of
free
will.
had
she
been
given
the
warnings
at
the
outset,
she
may
well
have
invoked
or
asked
for
an
attorney
when
pressure
was
too
intense
on
her.
what
we're
leaving--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--i
think,
your
honor,
once...
once
she
had
been
subjected
to
the
lengthy
interrogation
and
they
got
that
statement
from
her
that
they
had
pressured
out
of
her,
then
when
she...
they
said,
you
know,
for...
for
instance,
they
would
have
an
incentive
to
say,
okay,
now
what
you
just
told
us
we're
going
to
put
on
tape
and
i
will
be
back
here
with
a
tape
recorder
and
we
will
put
it
on
tape.
this
is
what
a
judge
and
a
jury
is
going
to
hear.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
i
don't
think
the
mere
failure
to
administer
the
warning
may
create
the
pressure,
but
it's
when
the
officer
embarks
upon
the...
the
specific
questioning
and
interrogation
to
get...
deliberately
elicit
an
incriminating
response,
then
you
have
this
type
of
coercive
environment
or
coercive
manner
of
questioning
that
elstad
was
concerned
with.
and
i
think
that's
why
elstad's
opinion
cited
pierce
and
westover
for
the
types
of
questioning
that
would
necessarily
or...
or
run
the
great
risk
of
coercing
the
defendant
into
confessing.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
i'm
just
looking
at
the
language
of
elstad
and
when
it
said
it's
an
unwarranted
extension
of
miranda,
it
was
saying
just
the
simple
failure
to
administer
the
warnings
unaccompanied
by
the
actual
coercive
tactics
or
the
manner
of
questioning
when
that
is
coercive
or
if...
if
the
environment
that
it's
being
done
in
is
coercive,
such
as
the,
you
know,
station
house,
then...
then
there
would
be
no
presumption,
then
the
second
statement
wouldn't
be
compelled.
but
when
you
have
those
factors,
when
there's
the
great
risk
that
it's
being...
that
the
statement
is
being
made
under
the
threat
of
coercion
or
pressure
or
where
the
environment
is...
is
coercive,
then
you
do
have
the
presumption.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
believe
that
under
miranda
when
the
court
said
that
the
custodial...
custodial
interrogation
exerts
inherently
coercive
pressure,
i
think
that
means
when
they
question
and
deliberately
elicit
an
incriminating
response
that
is
compelling,
and--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--because
there,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
was
balancing
the
interest
of
law
enforcement
against
the
interest
of
allowing
a
suspect
to
get
on
the
stand
and
later
lie
at
trial.
it
affected
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
trial,
which
is
greatly
impacted
here
because
here--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--in...
in
terms
of
whether
you're
going
to
admit
the
second
statement,
in
the
presence
of
the
potential
for
coercion
or
actual
coercion,
then
the
burden
needs
to
shift
to
the
state.
when
they've
employed
these
tactics
that
generate
the
risk
of
compulsion,
they
need
to
show
that
that
risk
never
manifested
itself.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
i'm
saying
that
if
in
this
context
where
it
was
actually
coerced,
then
no,
her
statement
would
not
have
been
admissible
to
impeach
her
at...
at
all
if
she
had
been...
testified
at
trial.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
well,
i
believe
the
missouri
supreme
court
found
that
only
in
circumstances
other
than
these
would
that
first
statement
have
been
found
voluntary.
that's
the
language
of
the
opinion.
they
also
found
the
waiver
involuntary
in
citing
the
westover-type
analysis.
the
two
cases
that
they
relied
on--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--the--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--the
trial
court
didn't
make
any
specific
fact-findings
about
voluntariness.
the...
all
it
was
concerned
was...
with
that
miranda
wasn't
given.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
i
believe
that
was
part
of
the
analysis,
but
the
reason
they
found
the
waiver
involuntary
was
because
of
the
continuous
nature
of
the
interrogation,
and
it
cited
the
westover-type
cases
for
that.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
and
i
think,
your
honor,
when
a
police
officer
deliberately
embarks
upon
a
tactic
to
undermine
the
free
will
of
a
suspect
in
a
coercive
setting
that
miranda
acknowledges
is
a
coercive
setting,
that
that
does
make
a
difference
because
it...
it
impels
the
police
officer
into
using
tactics
that
otherwise
wouldn't
be
permissible,
such
as
referring
to
the
unwarned
statement
to
get
a
waiver--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i...
and
that's
why
i...
i
went
back
to
the
missouri
supreme
court's
opinion
where
they
found
that
the
waiver
was
involuntary
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
the
interrogation,
that
the--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--well,
your
honor,
maybe
the
premise
of
the
question
presented
was
incorrect
that
there
was
no--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
we
cited
westover.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
well,
i
don't
want
to--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
finish
the
chief
justice's--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--i
don't
want
to
leave
any
doubt
that
i...
that
the
first
statement
we
are
asserting
in
the
first
instance
was
actually
coerced.
i
mean,
we
disagree
that--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--i
don't
believe
that
what
the
police
officers
did
here
would
have
rise...
rose
to
the
level
of
fourth
amendment
due
process
involuntariness,
no.
but
i
do
believe
it
violated
the
fifth
amendment
bar
on
coerced,
compelled
testimony.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
i
believe
that
sometimes
the
second
statement
may
be
admitted,
and
that's
what
elstad
said.
even
in
the
presence
of
actual
coercion,
they
said
that
it
could
be
dispelled.
and--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--i
think
if
there
was
a
passage
of
time,
it
would
dispel
it,
and
that
certainly
didn't
occur
here.
even
in
westover,
there
was
a
15
to
20-minute
break
by
the
time
the
police
stopped
questioning
and
the
fbi
started
questioning,
and
that
came
out
at
oral
argument.
solicitor
general
thurgood
marshall
said
there
was
a
break.
so
there
was
no
break
here.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
i'm
not
sure
it
could
entirely
turn
on
that,
but
for
instance,
if
questioning
had
occurred
the
next
day,
i
believe
that
would
be
a...
a
sufficient
break.
and
i
think
the
missouri
supreme
court
cited
another
of
our
state
cases,
state
v.
wright,
where
this
exact
thing
happened,
questioning
occurred
and
then
a
day
passed,
and
then
questioning
occurred
again,
and
that
was
sufficient
to
break
the
causal
link.
i
think
if
officers
embarking
on
this
type
of
calculated,
unwarned
questioning
then
add
to
their
warnings,
when
they
finally
give
them,
that
what
you
said
can't
be
used
against
you,
if
they
would
have
added
that,
that
might
have
helped
an
attenuation
analysis.
but
i
think
clearly
none
of
that
occurred
here.
i
think
the...
another
problem
with
this
case
and
this
type
of
tactic
is
that
it
affects
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
trial,
the
jury,
and
what
it's
finding
because
the
first
thing
the
jury
hears
is
when
the
tape
is
played
and
they
hear
immediately
a
waiver
of
rights
and--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--i
believe
it
was
15
to
20
minutes.
20
minutes,
if
according
to
the
court,
yes.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
going
back
to
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
jury,
when
the
jury
is
listening
to
the
statement,
they
are
presuming
that
she
immediately
waived
her
rights.
they
know
nothing
of
what
occurred
before,
and
the
only
way
that
we
can
challenge
that
and
show
that
maybe
this
confession
shouldn't
be
given
the
weight
that
it...
it
otherwise
would
have
is
that
she
underwent
this
lengthy
interrogation.
and
the
only
way
we
can
bring
that
for
the...
before
the
jury
is
to
show
them
that
she,
in
fact,
made
an
unwarned
statement.
and
that...
it
precludes
our
ability
to
defend
her
by
not
being
able
to
show
under
what
circumstances
she
ultimately
made
that
waiver.
it
also
allows
the...
the
unwarned
statement
to
come
in
because
on
that
tape
recording
you
have
the
officer
mentioning
that
she
made
an
unwarned
statement,
and
the
jury
is
never
supposed
to
hear
that.
so
here
you
have
the
jury
thinking,
well,
she
made
two
statements.
it
must
be
the
truth.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
right.
i
mean,
and
when
that's
denied
we
are
still
able
to
show
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
made
are
relevant
to
the
weight
to
be
given
to
it.
i
mean,
the
jury
can
always
weigh
the
credibility
of
the
suspect
and...
in
assessing
the
weight
to
be
given
to
her
confession.
and
we
cannot
challenge
that
here
without
referring
to
the
unwarned
questioning.
if
there's
no--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
i
guarantee
you
that
if
this
court
says
that
this
practice
is
okay,
it
will
become
embedded
in
police
procedure
just
like
miranda
has
been
because
the
police--
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
--exactly.
i
mean,
they
have
more
incentive
not
to
warn,
especially
because
they
talked
to
her
before
on
two
occasions.
they...
and
i
think
they
tape
recorded
her
interview
with
them
on
the...
february
14th,
hoping
that
she
would
make
some
sort
of
incriminating
statement,
and
when
she
didn't,
then
they
engaged
in
this
practice
to
subject
her
to
the
intense
custodial
interrogation
to
try
and
get
the...
the
warning
from
her.
but
they
weren't...
i
mean...
excuse
me...
the
confession
from
her.
but
they
weren't
going
to
warn
her
because
they
were
afraid
she
might
invoke.
and
i
think
this
court
in
escobedo
said,
you
know,
we
shouldn't
fear
that
a
suspect
is
going
to
assert
her
rights
if
she
knew
about
them.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the...
that
specific
principle
would
remain
and
that
this
court
would
agree
with
that
we
should
not
have
to
fear
that
a
suspect
will
invoke
their
rights.
i
mean,
that
was
the
whole
premise
of
miranda
is
that
they
have
to
be
made
aware
of
their
rights
so
that
they
have
the
free
will
to
invoke
them
if...
if
they
are
not
willing
to
be
subjected
to
the
intense
pressure
of
the
custodial
interrogation.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
i
think
it
presents
that
question.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
the
court
should
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
initial
statement
was
voluntary,
and
that
is...
that's
always
been
our
first
line
of
defense,
is
that
this
wasn't
a
voluntary
statement
because
under
elstad...
under
elstad
the
court
said
that
when
a
suspect
is
being
subjected
to
a
coercive
environment
or
where
the
manner
of
the
questioning
in
the
case
is
coercive,
then
the
standard
elstad
rule
doesn't
apply.
and...
and
especially
because
when
justice
brennan
tried
to
posit
this
two-step
interrogation
that
it
would
become
all
the
rage
and
specifically...
i
mean,
the
description
of
justice
brennan's
two-step
interrogation
mirrors
this...
this
exactly.
this
court
said
that's
apocalyptic.
we
are
not
encouraging
that.
we
do
not
want
police
officers
or
prosecutors
to...
to
use
that
tactic.
and...
and
unfortunately,
i
believe
law
enforcement
took
the
invitation
of
justice
brennan's
dissent
perhaps
and
didn't
listen
to
what
you
said
in
the
majority
opinion.
i
think
this
tactic
is
bad
for
the
police.
it
is
bad
for
suspects,
and
it
is
bad
for
courts.
it's
got
three
strikes
against
it.
and
the
test
that
we
would
ask
you
to
apply
is
that
when
police
officers
deliberately
withhold
miranda
in
order
to
elicit
an
incriminating
response
when
they
knew
or
should
have
known
that
miranda
was
required,
then
the
second
statement
will
be
presumed
compelled
unless
and
until
the
state
can
show
that
it
has
been
attenuated
from
the
first.
and
if
there--
ms.
amy

--i...
i
think
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officers
will
inform
what
the
officers
feel
they
are
allowed
to
do
during
the
questioning
session.
the...
the
fbi
itself
required
warnings
long
before
miranda
and
it
was
because
it
made
the...
the
interrogators
respect
the
person's
rights,
and
that's
why
the
warnings
were
required.
if
the
officer
intends
to
disrespect
those
rights
and
leave
the
fifth
amendment
unprotected,
then
i
think
there's
a
grave
danger
that
they
will
use
tactics
that
they
used
here,
that
they
will
refer
to
the
unwarned
statement
to
pressure
the
waiver,
that
they
will
refer
to
the
unwarned
statement
to
get
the
second
statement,
and
that
there
will
never
be
an
exercise
of
the
suspect's
free
will.
ms.
amy
m.
bartholow
well,
i
think
in
the
absence...
well,
when
there's
a
good
faith
mistake,
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
run
into
the
types
of
coercive
pressures
that
were
applied,
and
that's
what
elstad
was.
you
had
one
or
two
questions
at
the
suspect's
house.
you
know,
we're
here
to
talk
about
a
burglary.
do
you
know
these
people?
yes.
well,
we
think
you
were
involved
in
it.
yes,
i
was
there.
period.
you
know.
there
was
a
question
whether
there
was
custody
or
not.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
have
found
custody
in
the
first
instance.
and
there
was
a
real
question
about
whether
that
constituted
an
interrogation
at
all.
and
i
think
in
those
circumstances...
or...
or
if
an
officer
just
didn't
know
that
they
hadn't
been
mirandized
by
the
first
officer
or
something,
when
there's
clearly
a
good
faith
error
on
the
part
of
the
police,
then
this
test
would
not
be
required.
thank
you.
