justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt?
you
say
the
second
warning
removes
the
presumption
as
to
the
earlier
unwarned
statement.
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
going
forward,
but
not
going
backward.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
still
have
the
presumption
that
the
earlier
statement
was
involuntary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
true
if
the...
if
the
conversation
after
the
warnings
includes
interrogation
about
what
he
said
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it...
would
it
affect
it
if
the
officer
said,
now,
an
hour
ago
you
told
me
x?
were
you
correct
in
saying
that
or
not?
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
a
broader
question?
is
there
anything...
if
your
submission
is
correct,
is
there
any
reason
why
a
police
department
should
not
adopt
a
policy
that
said,
never
give
miranda
warnings
until
a
suspect
confesses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
has
he
got
to
lose
is
what
i
have
to
understand.
because
if
the...
if
he
doesn't
confess
anyway,
you
haven't
lost
anything.
he
wouldn't
have
confessed
with
the
miranda
warning.
if
he
does
confess,
then
you've
got
a
shot
at
getting
it
in
after
giving
him
the
miranda
warning.
justice
stevens
why
would
you
not...
why
would
you
not
always
adopt
that
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
whether
you...
you
to
comment
on
one...
what
if
we
required
that
the
second
warning
include
a
statement
that
you
realize
what
you
said
up
to
now
would
be
inadmissible
in
your
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
gornstein,
you're
just
making
a
different
compelled
inquiry.
now
you're
not
asking
whether
the
warned
statement
was
compelled,
but
you're
asking
in
every
case
whether
the
earlier
statement
was
compelled
so
that
you'd
have
the
police
have
a
policy
of
always
refusing
to
give
warning,
but
say,
well,
don't
question
him
for
more
than
8
or
9
hours
or
something
like
that
because
you
run
the
risk
of
compulsion.
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
going
to
get
that
same
factual
inquiry
with
respect
to
the
earlier
statement
that
miranda
was
designed
to
prevent...
to
avoid
with
respect
to
the
later
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you...
you
agree
that's
inadmissible
if
the
earlier
one
was
compelled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm...
i'm
assuming
it's
clear
from
the
evidence
the
first
statement
was
not
merely
presumptively
compelled
but
actually
compelled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
not
automatically
follow
the
second
would
be
inadmissible?
