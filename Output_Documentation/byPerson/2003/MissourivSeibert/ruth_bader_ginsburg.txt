is
time
relevant?
suppose
as
soon
as
the
officers
got
what
they
wanted
from
mrs.
seibert,
they
didn't
give
her
a
20-minute
break
to
have
a
cigarette,
they
said,
fine,
we
got
it.
now
we're
going
to
redo
your
miranda
rights
nice
and
slow
and
then
go
right
on
with
the
questions.
is
there
any
significance
to
the
time
and
place?
that
is,
she
was...
she
was
in
the
same
room
with
the
same
officers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it
had
been
one
continuous
episode,
but
in
the
middle
of
it,
they
gave
her
miranda
warnings.
justice

bader

mr.
gornstein,
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
gornstein,
i...
miranda,
whatever
it
has
become,
has
all
over
it
inform
at
once,
and
what
we're
talking
now
is,
no,
miranda
isn't
inform
at
once
at
all.
it's...
it
can
be.
don't
inform
until,
until
you've
gotten
enough,
and
then.
now,
that
seems
to
me
quite
a
different
thing.
anyone
reading
the
miranda
decision
says,
oh,
yes,
these
are
the
things
the
police
are
supposed
to
say
up
front.
and
now
you're
saying,
no,
it
doesn't
really
mean
that
at
all.
it
means
don't
inform
of
your
rights
until,
somewhere
in
midstream.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
enough?
if...
if
there's
an
interval,
same
place,
same
officers,
but
it...
is
everything...
everything
turn
on
how
much
time
there
is
in
between
the
two?
