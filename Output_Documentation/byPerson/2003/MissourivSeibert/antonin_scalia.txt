justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
your...
your
position
on
that
point.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
has
been
no
coercion
in
the
first
confession,
how
could...
how
could
it
possibly
be
relevant
to
whether
the
second
confession
is
voluntary,
whether
there
had
been
a
prior
admission?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
say
control.
how
could
it
possibly
be
relevant?
unless
you're
saying
what
is
relevant
is
whether
miranda
was
observed,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it
was
necessarily
involuntary.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
you're
inviting
courts
to
do
is
to
say,
well,
he
wouldn't
have
made
the
second
confession
had
he
not
made
the
first
one
which
was
unwarned
under
miranda
and
therefore
the
second
one
is
also
presumptively...
that's
what
you're
inviting.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it
can't
carry
the
day,
but
it's...
it's
one
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
reference
back
could
cause
it...
could
cause
the
later
statement
to
be
involuntary
because?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
not
in
and
of
itself,
but
it...
it
tends
to
show
that
the
prior
statement...
that
the
later
statement
is
involuntary.
unless
it
tends
to
show
that,
it's
irrelevant.
now,
why
is
it
that
it
tends
to
show
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
the
only
way
it
could
have
any
bearing,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the
person
would
have
said,
what
the
heck,
i've
already
coughed
it
up,
i
may
as
well...
i
may
as
well
do
it
again.
and
you
think
that
that
makes
the
second
one
involuntary.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
it
does
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
doesn't,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
at
all
be
relevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
we
said
totality
of
the
circumstances,
i...
i
had
always
thought
we
meant
totality
of
the
relevant
circumstances,
you
know,
not
whether
it's
a
tuesday
afternoon
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
true
if...
if
we
accept
that...
that
the
first
statement
was
pressured
out
of
her.
i
mean,
i
assume...
i
assume
that
what
we're
proceeding
on
here
is
the
belief
that
it
was
not
coercion
in
the
first
instance.
i
think
everybody
agrees
if
it
was
coerced
in
the
first
instance,
the
case
is
over.
is
that
what
you
mean
by
pressured
out
of
her,
or...
or
the
mere...
the
mere
failure
to
give
miranda
warning
constitutes
pressure?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and...
and
if
it
did
coerce,
then...
then
elstad
said
its
rule
would
not
apply.
wasn't
elstad
only
saying
that
when
this
exists,
there
may
be
possible
a
finding
of
actual
coercion,
but
it's...
it's
not
assuming
that
there
is
actual
coercion
whenever
that
exists
or...
or
making
a
total
exception
from
the
rule
that
it
laid
down
for
situations
in
which
there
was
what
you
call...
what...
what
do
you
call
it?
orderly
interrogation
or
programmed
interrogation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when
it
speaks
of
coercive
environment
or
coercive
tactics,
i...
i
assumed
that
what
it
meant
is
that
the
prior
confession
was
coerced.
justice
antonin
scalia
we...
we
have
not
balanced
if
there
were
actual
coercion.
i
mean,
once
you
find
actual
coercion,
the
game
is
over.
you
don't
bend
the
law
into
balance.
justice
scalia
ms.
bartholow,
you...
you've
asserted
that
the
question
presented
is
not...
is
not
really
accurate,
that...
that
the
missouri
court,
in
fact,
had
found
that
given
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
one
of
which
was
the
intentional
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings,
the
second
statement
was...
was
coerced.
and
i
find
that
in
fact
that
your
brief
in
opposition
did
make
that
point.
now,
if...
if
the
question
presented
as
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief
is
not
accurate,
what
do
you
think
would
be
accurate?
would...
do
you
think
it
presents
the
question
at
least
of
whether
the
intentional
failure
to
give
a
miranda
warning
is
one
of
the
factors
properly
considered
in
determining
whether
the
second
confession
is
voluntary
or
not?
it
at
least
presents
that
question,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
the
intentionality
or
not
of
the
failure
to
give
the
miranda
warning
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
the
second
confession
is
voluntary
or
not?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
why
it's...
it's
a
nasty
thing
and
you
don't
want
the...
you
don't
want
the
state
to
do
an
end
run
around
miranda,
as
you
understand
miranda,
but
why
does
it
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
coercive...
with
the
coerced
or
non-coerced
nature
of
the
second
confession?
the...
the
woman
would
feel
just
as
coerced
whether
the
failure
to
give
it
was...
was
intentional
or
non-intentional
it
seems
to
me.
