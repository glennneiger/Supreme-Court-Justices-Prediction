mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
officer's
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings
before
taking
an
initial
statement
does
not
presumptively
taint
the
admissibility
of
a
subsequent
statement
that
has
been
preceded
by
miranda
warnings
and
an
express
waiver
of
miranda
rights.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
risk
of
compulsion
that
is
inherent
in
unwarned
custodial
interrogation
and
that
makes
the
first
statement
inadmissible
is
counteracted
once
miranda
warnings
have
been
given.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
is
exactly
the
requirement
that
this
court
rejected
in
elstad,
and
the
only
difference
between
this
case
and
in
elstad
identified
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
is
that
here
the
initial
failure
to
warn
was
intentional.
and
the...
the
fact
of
intentionality
adds
nothing
to
the
level
of
compulsion
that
is
experienced
by
the
suspect
during
the
initial
interrogation.
it
adds
nothing
to
the
psychological
force
that
operates
on
the
suspect
who
has
confessed
once
as
a
result
of
unwarned...
during
unwarned
questioning
and
the
giving
and
subsequent
administration
of
miranda
warnings
is
no
less
effective
in
providing
the
information
that
is
necessary
to
make
a
knowing
and
voluntary
decision--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
because
start
with
elstad
which
rejected
any
requirement
of
a
break.
and...
and
elstad
also
said
that
the
risk
of
compulsion
that
is
inherent
in
the
initial
interrogation
and
that
makes
that
inadmissible
is
counteracted
once
the
miranda
warnings
have
been
given,
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
significant
break
between
the
initial
and
the
second
interrogation.
now
let
me
address
your
question
about
reasonable
and
knowing
and
whether
that
should
make
a
difference.
the
fact
that
the
warnings
were
known,
that...
that
this
was
a
custodial
interrogation
situation,
the
fact
that
the
officer
may
have
been
unreasonable
in
thinking
it
was
not...
neither
of
those
adds
anything
to
the
level
of
compulsion
that
is
experienced
by
the
suspect
during
the
initial--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
the
difference
between
this
situation
and
miranda
is
that
what
miranda
addressed
was
a
situation
where
you
were
relying
solely
on
a
voluntariness
inquiry
to
determine
whether
the
statements
that
were
admitted
were
compelled.
and
the
court
has
determined
that
there
is
an
unacceptable
risk
in
that
situation
when
all
you're
relying
on
is
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
a
compelled
statement
will
be
admitted.
in
this
situation,
you
are
not
relying--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--totally
on
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
ginsburg,
how
i...
how
i
would
describe
it
is
that
you
are
required
to
give
miranda
warnings
if
the
government
is
going
to
be
able
to
introduce
this...
the
statements
as
substantive
evidence
of
the
defendant's
guilt.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
the
difference,
justice
stevens,
is
that...
that
yes,
there
will
be
inquiry
into
the
voluntariness
of
the
first
statement
and
the
second
statement,
but
the
difference
is
that
the
only
statement
that
is
being
admitted
is
the
second
statement.
and
that's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
not
automatically
inadmissible
if
it
was
compelled,
justice
stevens.
there
would
be
a--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
that
would
be
presumptively
taint...
it
would
presumptively
taint
the
subsequent
statement
and
then
you
would
look
to
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
then...
then
the
situation,
justice
stevens,
is
you
would
look
to
a
taint
analysis
to
see
whether
other
additional
factors
cured
the
initial
compulsion
and
made
the
second
statement
voluntary.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
what...
what
i...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i...
i
just
wanted
to
get
this
one...
one
thing
answered
which
is
that
when
you
are
looking
at
the
second
statement
and
admitting
it,
you...
it
is
a
statement
that
has
been
preceded
by
miranda
warnings.
there
is
an
express
waiver
of
miranda
rights.
there's
a
finding
of
voluntariness
of
the
first,
a
finding
of
voluntariness
of
the
second,
and
as
to
that
statement
at
that
point,
there
simply
is
not
an
unacceptable
risk
that
that
statement
has
been
compelled.
and
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
serious
cost
to
the
administration
of
justice
when
you
exclude
from
the
jury's
consideration
what...
a
statement
that
is
warned
and
voluntary
and
very
highly
probative
evidence
of
the
defendant's
guilt.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
has
to
be
an
inquiry
into
the...
there
has
to
be
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
that
is
for
sure.
and
if
the
officer
does
anything
to
pressure
the
suspect,
as
the
court
said
in
elstad,
to
force
a
waiver,
then
that
would
invalidate
the
subsequent
statement.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i...
i
think
what
is
fair
to
say
is
if
it
has
crossed
over
into
compulsion,
yes.
but
if
all
there
is
is
a
risk
of
compulsion
and...
and
that's
what
makes
the
first
statement
inadmissible,
then
whether
or
not
there's
a
greater
risk
in
the
second
situation
of
compulsion
than
the
first--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
longer
the
interrogation,
that
makes
it
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
but
once
miranda
warnings
have
been
given,
that
is
sufficient
to
cure
any
risk
of
compulsion
no
matter
how
high.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i'm
sorry.
then
i
think
that
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
i--
