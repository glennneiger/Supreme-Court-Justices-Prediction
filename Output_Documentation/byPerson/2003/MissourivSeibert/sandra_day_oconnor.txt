ms.
mitchell,
do
you
take
the
position
that
we
have
to
conduct
a
voluntariness
inquiry
in...
as
to
the
second
statement--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--after
the
warnings
were
given?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
agree
with
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
doing
that,
do
you
think
that
the
officer's
use
of
the
initial
confession
to
get
the
defendant
to
admit
what
went
on
is
irrelevant
to
that
voluntariness
inquiry--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
just
that
it
isn't
sufficient
to
determine
the
outcome?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what...
what
is
your
position
exactly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
is
relevant
in
the
inquiry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
what
the
court
did
was
make
its
decision
on
the
basis
that
the
miranda
warning
was
intentionally
not
given
and
that
that
was
the
reason
that
the
supreme
court
found
that
the
statement
could
not
be
admitted.
it...
it
didn't
turn
on
actual
coercion,
did
it?
what
did
the
trial
court
find
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
actual
coercion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wasn't
given,
and
the
reason
that
the
supreme
court
felt
that
it
had
to
be
suppressed
was
because
the
decision
not
to
give
miranda
was
an
intentional
decision
by
the
officer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
you'd
look
at
what
happened
in
the
second
discussion
after
miranda
warnings
were
given
to
determine
whether
it
was
voluntary...
a
voluntary
statement
or
not.
was
there
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
of
those
rights
given
at
the
second
statement?
isn't
that
the
proper
inquiry?
