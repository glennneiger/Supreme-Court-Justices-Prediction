justice
david
h.
souter
no,
please
finish.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
difficulty
i
have
with
the
argument
is
the
premise
that
you
state...
is
in
accepting
the
premise
that
you
state,
and
that
is
that
a
second
interrogation
that
falls
on
the
heels
of
the
first...
here,
i
think
there
was
a
20-minute
break...
can
really
be
separated
as
a
matter
of
simple
psychology.
i...
i
have
difficulty
in
accepting
the
plausibility
of
a
conclusion
that
the...
that
the
ostensible
waiver
in
the
second
case
is
really
a
free
waiver
as
distinct
from
sort
of
throwing
up
one's
hands
and
saying
it's
too
late
to
say
no
now.
it's
the...
it...
there's
a
basic
implausibility
in
your
case.
what...
what
can
you
offer
on
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
elstad...
i
mean,
let
me...
and
maybe
that's
the
way
i
should
have
focused
the
case.
in...
in
elstad,
you
did
not
have
a...
let's
say,
a...
a
systematic
questioning
of
the...
of
the
sort
that
went
on
here.
here
the...
the
police
did,
indeed,
engage
in
a
kind
of
first-round
interrogation,
and
the...
the
intensity
of
their
pressure
to
get
answers
in
this
case
seems
to
me
qualitatively
different
from
elstad.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's...
comparatively
speaking,
i...
i
think
maybe
that
was...
that
was
relatively
easy
to
tell
in
elstad.
here,
it's
going
to
be
a
serious
issue,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
litigate
this
issue
as
the
threshold
issue
to
determining
whether
the
second
waiver
or
as
part
of
the
litigation
as
to
whether
the...
the
ostensible
waiver
really
is
a
waiver
and
the
second
statement
really
is
voluntary,
we're
right
back
in
the
morass
of
litigation,
which
is
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
miranda
to
avoid
in
the
first
place.
we...
we
said,
look,
this...
this
litigation
is
very
difficult.
it's
difficult
to
engage
in
this
litigation
and
produce
a...
a
clear
and
reliable
answer.
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
the
position
you
take
forces
us
right
back
into
that
litigation
position
that
we
tried
to
get
away
from
in
miranda
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
want
us
to
wade
deeper.
you're...
you're
absolutely
right.
there's...
there's
no...
there's
no
easy
way.
but
your
way
would
make
it
more
difficult.
your...
your
way
would
promote
litigation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
it's
simply
that
the
closer
the
interrogation,
the
less
likely
that
there
is
in
fact
a
voluntary
waiver.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it's...
it's
more
than
simply
a...
i
mean,
there's...
there's
no
question
that
the...
that
the
crucial
element
is
a
decision
made
with
appreciation
of
legal
rights.
but
the
other
crucial
element
is
that
the
decision
to
waive
them
be
voluntary.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
seems
to
me
the
closer
you
are
to
the
prior
statement,
the
closer
you
are
to
saying
to
yourself,
what
have
i
got
left
to
waive?
sure,
i'll
go
ahead.
i've
already
done
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
that's
not
a...
that's
not
a
function
of...
of
knowledge
of
law.
it's
a
function
of
proximity
to
the
prior
statement.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know...
do
you
know
why
we...
we
have
the
common
phrase,
i
think
i'll
sleep
on
it?
we
have
that
phrase
because
we're...
we're
likely
to
make
a...
a
more
intelligent
decision
if
we
have
more
time.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gornstein--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
please
finish
your
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gornstein,
you
in...
in
the
answer
you
just
finished
giving
and
i
think
throughout
your
argument,
you
were
making...
i
think
you
were
making
the
assumption
that
there
are
two
inquiries
that
should
be
made
in
the
situation
that
you
envision.
one
is
the
voluntariness
of
the
first
statement,
the
unwarned
statement.
second
is
the
voluntariness
of
the
second
statement,
following
the
warnings.
do
you
agree
that
there
is
a
third
inquiry
and
that
is
the
voluntariness
of
the
waiver?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
don't
you
think
that
the...
the
situation
presented
by
this
kind
of
case...
for
purposes
of...
of
judging
the
voluntariness
of
the
waiver,
don't
you
think
that
the
situation
presented
by
this
kind
of
case
is
significantly
different
from
the
situation
presented
by
elstad?
because
elstad
did
not
involve
a
systematic
interrogation.
this
did.
isn't
it
fairly
true
to
say
as
a
general
rule
that
following
a
systematic
interrogation,
there
is
less
likelihood
of
a
truly
voluntary
waiver
of
the
right
to
silence
than
in
the
elstad
situation?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
trying
to
keep
it
simpler.
i...
i
grant
you
that
if
there
was
compulsion,
the
risk
is
greater.
i'm...
i'm
suggesting
that
without
having
to
get
into
the
question
and
making
a
final
determination
of
whether
we're
going
to
label
the
first
statement
a
subject
of
compulsion
or
not,
isn't
the
very
fact
that
there
has
been
a
systematic
interrogation
in
a
case
like
this
a
fact
that
makes
it
less
likely,
not
more
likely,
that
the...
that
the
miranda
waiver,
when
it
comes,
will
not
be
a
voluntary
waiver?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
it's...
but
that's...
you're...
you're
getting
to
question
three
again.
i'm
talking
about
question
two--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
likelihood
of
a
voluntary
waiver.
justice
david
h.
souter
we've
got
to...
we've
got
to
touch
that
base
before
we
ask
the
question
about
compulsion.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
as
i...
may
i
interrupt
you
and
ask
you
to...
whether
this
distinction
captures
your
case?
i...
i
have
understood
you
to
be
saying
that
the...
the
first
statement
was...
was
coercive
in
the
sense
that
miranda
spoke
of
a
custodial
interrogation
as
being
inherently
coercive.
it
was
not,
on
the
other
hand,
coerced
in
the
sense
that
it
was
the
product
of
beating
him
over
the
head
with
a
2
by
4.
and
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
been
saying,
look,
any
unwarned
miranda...
unwarned
statement
that
is
given
in
custody
shares
the...
the
character
that
miranda
said
it
had,
inherently
coercive
atmosphere.
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
same
thing
as...
as
coercion
carried
to
the
point
of
hitting
him
over
the
head.
is
that
the
distinction
that...
that
underlies
your
argument,
or
am
i
putting
words
in
your
mouth?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
the
police
arrested
the
respondent,
seibert,
on
a
charge
of
murder
and
brought
her
to
an
interview
room
in
the
station
house
without
giving
her
warnings
required
by
the
miranda
case
about
her
right
to
remain
silent
and
have
the
help
of
a
lawyer.
an
officer
interrogated
her
for
30
or
40
minutes
and
elucidated
a
full
confession.
after
a
20-minute
break,
the
officer
recited
miranda
warnings
and
obtained
a
signed
waiver
of
rights.
he
then
resumed
questioning
and
confronted
seibert
with
the
statement
she
had
given
before
the
warnings.
she
repeated
her
prior
answers.
when
she
was
charged
with
first
degree
murder,
she
sought
to
exclude
her
statement.
it
was
taken
in
violation
of
the
miranda
warning
requirement.
the
officer
testified
that
in
giving
no
miranda
warnings
at
the
start
of
interrogation,
he
had
a
used
a
technique
in
which
he
had
been
trained,
question
first,
get
a
confession,
then
give
miranda
warnings
and
question
again
until
the
suspect
repeats
the
earlier
confession.
the
trial
court
admitted
the
statement
given
after
the
midstream
miranda
recitation.
the
jury
convicted
seibert
of
second
degree
murder.
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
however,
reversed
on
the
ground
that
seibert’s
statement
should
not
have
been
admitted
into
evidence
because
it
had
been
taken
in
violation
of
miranda.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
opinions
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
affirm.
the
object
of
miranda
is
to
inform
a
suspect
of
a
genuine
choice
to
speak
to
the
police
or
remain
silent.
by
contrast,
the
object
of
the
interrogation
tactic
at
issue
here
is
to
render
miranda
warnings
ineffective
by
giving
them
only
after
a
confession.
the
object
is
to
get
an
admissible
confession
the
suspect
would
not
make
if
he
understood
his
rights
at
the
outset.
and
miranda
warnings
given
in
these
circumstances
are
likely
to
be
ineffective
to
consider
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
unwarned
interrogation
was
conducted
in
the
station
house
and
the
questioning
was
systematic
and
exhaustive.
the
warned
phase
of
the
questioning
proceeded
in
the
same
place
after
only
a
short
break.
the
warning
that
anything
you
say
can
and
will
be
used
against
you
could
lead
into
a
reasonable
inference
that
what
the
suspect
has
just
said
will
be
used
with
subsequent
silence
being
of
no
avail.
and
the
police
did
not
counter
this
possibility
by
advising
seibert
that
her
prior
statements
could
not
be
used
against
her.
quite
the
opposite,
the
officer’s
questions
referred
to
the
confession
already
given.
these
circumstances
so
challenge
the
efficacy
of
the
warnings
that
a
reasonable
person
in
the
suspect’s
shoes
would
not
have
understood
that
she
had
a
choice
to
talk
or
remain
silent.
because
we
cannot
reasonably
conclude
that
the
warnings
given
could
serve
miranda's
purpose,
seibert’s
statements
are
inadmissible.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
the
judgment;
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
