argument
next
in

02-1371,
missouri
v.
seibert.
ms.
mitchell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
reference
back,
ms.
mitchell,
you
mean
the
interrogator
refers
back
to
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--earlier
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
you're
reserving
your
time,
ms.
mitchell?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
ms.
bartholow.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
a
systematic
interrogation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i
realize
there
may
be
cases,
but
how
about
you
defining
what
you
mean
by
a
systematic
interrogation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other...
it...
it
doesn't
have
to
go
over
any
period
of
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
the
whole
point
of
interrogation,
is
to
elicit
statements?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
why
have
we
allowed
admission
of
so
many
statements,
you
know,
impeachment,
public...
public
interest,
that
sort
of
thing,
that
result
from
a
situation
where
there
weren't
miranda
warnings
given
if...
if
simply
station
house
interrogation
always
produces
coercion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're...
you...
you...
in
what
you
just
said,
you
say,
you
know,
potential
for...
for
coercion,
coercion.
those
are
different
things.
coercion,
in...
in
the
sense
we've
used
it
in
the
fifth
amendment
cases,
means
that
the
confession
is
involuntary,
and
as
justice
scalia
says,
there's...
there's
no
balancing
there.
but
you're
using
it
in
a
different
sense,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
no
lower
court
has
found
that
the
statement
was
actually
coerced
or
that
the
confession...
the
statement
was
involuntary
because
of
tactics
of
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you...
in...
did
you
in
your
brief
in
opposition
make
the
point
that
you
thought
that
it
was...
it
was
coerced?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let...
let
me
interrupt
you
for
just
a
minute,
ms....
is...
is
it
agreed
that
the
break
here
was
20
minutes?
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
majority
opinion
says.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
escobedo
was
pretty
much
overruled
by
miranda,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
bartholow.
ms.
mitchell,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mitchell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1371,
missouri
against
seibert
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
