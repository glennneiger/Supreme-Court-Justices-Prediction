ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
miranda's
core
ruling
is
that
an
unwarned
statement
may
not
be
used
in
the
prosecution's
case
in
chief
to
prove
guilt.
in
this
case,
the
prosecution
did
not
seek
to
admit
an
unwarned
statement,
rather
the
statement
that
was
offered
was
preceded
by
a
meticulous
recitation
of
miranda
warnings,
an
express
waiver
of
rights,
and
was
the
product
of
non-coercive
questioning.
a
fully
warned
and
otherwise
voluntary
statement
is
not
tainted
by
the
existence
of
a
prior
unwarned
statement
even
if
the
officer
intentionally
initiated
questioning
without
warning
and
that
is
true
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
an
officer's
intent
does
not
render
the
unwarned
statement
actually
involuntary.
the
unwarned
statement
is
merely
presumptively
compelled,
and
once
warnings
are
administered,
that
presumption
ends
and
the
suspect
has
the
information
necessary
to
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
decision
about
waiver.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
going
forward,
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
no.
no,
your
honor.
only
going...
it...
it
ends
the
presumption
at
that--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--yes,
your
honor.
it
ends
the
presumption
that
that...
at
that
point
going
forward
because
it
provides
the--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--it
would
depend
on
how
that
happened,
but
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
yes,
it
would
still
remain
true.
there
are
essentially...
under
miranda,
there
are
two
elements
that
we
have
to
look
at
in
determining
whether
a
statement
is
admissible,
and
that
is
whether
you
have
a
knowing,
intelligent,
voluntary
waiver
and
whether
the
statement
is
in
fact
voluntary.
if
there
is
a
reference
back,
as
there
was
in
this
case
to
the
previous
statement,
it
could
be
a
problem
if
that
is
part
of
the
waiver
element.
and
i
believe
that's
what
this
court
indicated
in
elstad
itself.
if
the
officer
used
that
in
a
way
that
affected
the
knowing
nature
then
of
what
the...
the
information
that
was
imparted
and
made
the
waiver
therefore
defective,
it
may
be
problematic.
however,
as
in
this
case,
where
there's
simply
a
reference
back
during
the...
the
questioning,
after
there
is
a
waiver
and
a
decision
to
go
forward,
that
alone
does
not
affect
the
voluntariness
of
that
subsequent
statement.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
i
think
so.
after
the
decision
has
been
made
to
waive
and
the
individual
has
decided
to
proceed
forward
and
talk,
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--because
it
does
not...
it
is
not
sufficient
to
overbore
the
individual's
will,
which
is
the
question
at
that
point
because
we're
at
the
voluntary
analysis
at
that
point.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
well,
first,
elstad
addressed
that
exact
issue
and
came
to
the
opposite
conclusion.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
it
is
different,
your
honor.
there
clearly
is
a
continuum.
but
the
appropriate
question
is
whether
the
first
statement
was
involuntary
or
not.
if
in
fact
that
questioning
and
that
pressure
had
been
great
enough
to
make
that
first
statement
involuntary,
then
absolutely
it
would
create
the
kind
of
taint
that
could
carry
forward
even
after
subsequent
warnings
were
given.
i
think
that
is
the
lesson
of
elstad.
but
elstad
draws
that
distinction
between
actual
coercion
and
presumptive
coercion,
and
where
it
is
merely
presumptive...
it
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
actual...
then
that
does
not
carry
forward.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
well,
two
observations
on
that,
your
honor.
first,
the
court
has
not
really
ever
gotten
away
from
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis.
the
court
has
continued
to
employ
it
as
the
primary
analysis--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--i...
i
don't
know
that
i
agree
with
that
because
i
don't
see
this
as
different
from
where
you
are
in
harris
where
you
still
have
to
do
a
full-blown
analysis
of
voluntariness.
it
is
somewhat
different
than
the
two-prong
analysis
that
is
done
in
every
case
where
voluntariness
is
at
issue
because
you
have
the
warnings
and
then,
arguably,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
is
somewhat
easier.
but,
nevertheless,
in
a
situation
such
as
harris,
where
you're
making
on
the
front
end
a
determination
on
voluntariness,
i
think
it
is
very,
very
similar
to
what...
what
we
are
suggesting
here.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
yes.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
yes.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
absolutely.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
i
would
not--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--i
think
it--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--i
think
it
is
not
sufficient
to
determine
the
outcome.
i
would
not
say
it
is
irrelevant.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
i
would
not
say
it's
irrelevant
because
i
think,
as
the
court
has
looked
at
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
what
is
necessary
to
show
coercion,
basically
the
court
has
looked,
i
believe,
at
two
elements:
the
conduct
of
the
officer
and
if
it
is
coercive,
and
the
effect
on
the
individual
considering
their
personality,
character
traits,
and
so
forth.
in
elstad,
when...
in
talking
about
the
effect
of
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
on
the
individual,
the
court
talked
about
some
subjective
disadvantage
that
the
individual
might
have,
and
so
i
suppose
that
type
of
analysis
could
lump
that
within
the
characteristics
of
the
individual
that
the
court
would
look
at
in
determining
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
i
don't
think
it
can
control,
your
honor,
and
i
don't--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--and
i
suppose
i
would
draw
the
distinction
between
the
questioning
and
the
answer,
which
i
think
is
a
distinction
this
court
drew
in
elstad
as
well.
i
don't
think
the
questioning
is
relevant
at
all
to
the
subsequent
statement,
and
certainly
i
would
agree
with
what
you're
saying.
when
there's
no
coercion,
it
should
not...
there's
no
taint
that
carries
forward.
but
if
it
is
to
be
considered
at
all...
and
perhaps
it
shouldn't
be,
but
in
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis,
if
there
is
a
reference
back
and
the
court
wants
to
consider
that
as
part
of
the
totality,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
might
look
at
from
the
perspective
of
whether
it
in
some
way
affects
the
individual.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
i
don't
think
so.
that...
that
fact
alone
could
never
carry
the
day,
and
i
think
that
was
made
very,
very
clear
in
elstad
where
that
was--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--correct.
but
just
the
reference
back
i
don't
believe
makes
it
any...
really
affects
it
or
makes
it
any...
any
different
than
the
fact
that
the
cat
has
already
been
let
out
of
the
bag--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--i
think...
i
think
there
are
lots
of
reasons
why...
why
police
departments
would
not
do
that.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
there
is
a
risk
associated
with
taking
this
type
of
an
approach,
and
as
our
officer
indicated
here,
he
was
rolling
the
dice.
he
did
not
indicate
that
he
did
this
in
every
single
interrogation
he...
he--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--what--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--well,
what
officers
want
when
they
do
an
interrogation
generally
is
an
admissible
statement
for
all
purposes,
not
for
some
limited
purpose.
and
so
what
they
are
looking
for
is
to
maximize
that
possibility,
and
they
know
that...
that
the
vast
majority
of
people,
according
to
studies,
percentage-wise
do
in
fact
waive
and
give
a
statement.
what
they
risk
then
is,
by
not
giving
the
warnings
on
the
front
end,
is
that
that
alone
will
become
a
factor
in
the
analysis
in
determining
whether
or
not
that
first
statement
was
voluntary.
if
the--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--in
and
of--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
in
this...
as
in
this
case,
where
there
is
a
reference
back,
i
think
the
court
could
look
at
that
as
one
factor
when
it's
determining
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
whether
the
statement
is
voluntary
or
not.
just
the
fact
that
there
had
been
previous
interrogation
or
previous
questioning
without
warnings
in
and
of
itself
i
do
not
believe,
under
any
circumstances,
could
carry
forward.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
yes.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
as
occurred
in
this
case.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
cause
the...
the
statement
to
be
involuntary
in
and
of
itself,
but--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--i
think
if
the
court
were
to
consider
that,
it
would
be
one
factor
bearing
on
how
the
other
circumstances
or
other
parts
of
the
police
conduct
affected
that
individual
because
in
the
analysis
in
elstad,
the
court
looked
at
this
question
of
the
effect
on
the
individual
of
having
spoken
before.
so
it
would
not
be
the...
the
previous
questioning
because
that--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--i
don't
think
that
makes
the
second--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--i
don't--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
court
is
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
what
we're
saying
is
that
may
be
one
circumstance
the--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--correct.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
we
do
not
believe
that
that
would
make
any
difference,
your
honor.
as
this
court
indicated
in
elstad,
a
waiver
that
is
otherwise
voluntary
and
knowing
is
not
ineffective
for
some
specific
period
of
time
simply
because
there
was
prior
interrogation.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
what...
what
you're
looking
at
to
determine
if
there's
a
voluntary
waiver
is
whether
the
individual
had
the
information,
specifically
the
legal
information,
they
needed
to
make
a
decision.
that
is
giving
them
their
warnings
and...
and
in
a
way
that
clearly
communicates
their
rights
to
them,
and
then
they
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
decision.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
correct.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
i
think--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--well,
two
things
on
that.
i
think
elstad
indicated
strongly
that
time
was
not
relevant.
it
would
be
relevant
if
we
were
doing
an
attenuation
analysis,
but
we're
not
because
there
wasn't
underlying
coercive
conduct,
one.
two,
i
think
if
you
look
at
cases
such
as
bayer,
this
court
has
indicated
that,
you
know,
once
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag,
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag.
and
perhaps,
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
way,
it
always
has
some
lingering
effect,
but
that
is
not
sufficient
to
make
the
second
statement
involuntary.
so
how
long
that
break
is--
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
--but
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
i
think
this
could
be
more
equated
to
buyer
remorse
where
someone
has
done
something
and
they
thought,
wow,
i
wish
i
hadn't
done
that.
and
then
they're
told
exactly
what
their
rights
are,
and
it's
like,
wow,
okay,
i
have
an
opportunity
to
change
what
i
have
just
done.
and
that's
what
i
think
really
is
going
on
here
when
the
warnings
are
read
to
the
individual,
and
so,
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
passage
of
time
is
relevant.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
at
this
time.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
yes.
ms.
karen
k.
mitchell
thank
you,
your
honor.
on
the
issue
of
systematic
interrogation
that
came
up
several
times
during
the
argument,
that
is
relevant
only
if
it
rises
to
the
level
of
making
that
first
statement
actually
involuntary.
and
i
think
that's
clear
from
the
elstad
opinion
itself.
at
one
point
during
the
elstad
opinion,
specifically
in
footnote
2
of
the
majority
opinion,
the
court
is
talking
about
lower
court
decisions
where
the...
the
lower
court
did
not
apply
the
attenuation-type
doctrine.
and
referring
to
some
of
those
cases
as
involving,
quote,
clearly
voluntary,
unwarned
admissions,
the
court
then
goes
on
and
cites
a
number
of
cases
that
involve
actual
station
house
interrogations,
in
many
cases
much
longer
than
the
interrogation
we
have
here.
specifically,
i'd
point
the
court
to
the
derrico
decision
cited
in
elstad.
so
just
the
idea
that
you
have
a
traditional
station
house-type
interrogation
is
not
enough.
the
question
is,
does
it
render
the
first
statement
involuntary
and
therefore
capable
of
tainting
the
second
statement?
in
this
case
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
each
statement
was
raised
in
the
initial
motion
to
suppress,
and
even
though
there
were
not
extensive
findings
by
the
trial
court,
they
denied
those
motions
to
suppress.
and
that
issue
was
not
raised
again
in
either
of
the
appellate
courts
in
missouri,
and
the
missouri
supreme
court
did
not
reach
that
issue.
on
the
question
of
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
held,
three
points
i
think
are
very
important.
the
court
starts
out
by
phrasing
or...
or
characterizing
its
decision
as
such.
essential
to
the
inquiry
is
whether
the
presumption
that
the
first
statement
was
involuntary
carries
over
to
the
second
statement.
the
court
then
goes
on
and
throughout
the
opinion
makes
the
decision
to,
in
fact,
carry
that
presumption
forward.
it
focuses
on
intent
and
finds
intent
to
be
an
improper
tactic,
as
this
court
used
that
phrase
in
elstad,
which
is
the
predicate
then
for
applying
a
fruits-type
analysis
and
requiring
attenuation,
which
is
exactly
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
does.
and
that
is
why
we
sought
cert
in
this
case.
as
to
this...
the...
the
apocalyptic
issue
and
justice
brennan's
discussion
in
elstad,
justice
brennan
talked
about
a
number
of
situations,
including
the
application
of
miranda
to
the
fourth
amendment,
including
the
use
of
statements
by
police
officers
to
garner
a
waiver
which
did
not
happen
here,
and
other
things
that
are
simply
inapplicable.
this
case
is
not
that
situation.
finally,
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
reverse
the
missouri
court
decision
that
focused
on
intent,
deterrence,
and
the
carrying
forward
of
the
presumption
to
taint
the
subsequent
statement
because
each
of
those
findings
are
inconsistent
with
this
court's
holding
in
elstad,
and
instead
to
apply
the
framework
of
elstad
to
this
case
and
to
reverse.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
