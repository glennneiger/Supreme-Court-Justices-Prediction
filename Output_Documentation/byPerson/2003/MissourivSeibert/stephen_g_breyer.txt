stephen
g.

that's...
that's
what's
not
clear
to
me,
that...
that...
it
seems
to
me
you're
absolutely
on
the
right
track
in
saying
that
miranda
has,
as
one
of
its
basic
purposes,
dealing
with
cases
where
there
may
or
may
not
be
compulsion.
we're
not
sure.
and
this
gets
rid
of
the
risk,
so
that
that's
a
very
good
way
of
describing
it.
and
then
it
seems
to
me
in
this
kind
of
case
we
have
two
risks.
one
was
the
risk
that
really
it
was
compelled...
the
first
statement.
and
second
is
the
risk
that
really
that
first
statement
does
lead
to
the
second
confession.
and
so
to
obviate
those
risks,
would
it
make
sense
to
say
in
any
case
where
the
police
knowingly
or
reasonably
should
have
known
they're
supposed
to
give
miranda
warnings
in
the
first
case,
you
can
use
the
second
statement
but
only
if
the
government
shows
that,
first
of
all,
that
first
one
wasn't
compelled?
second,
it
shows
that
the
miranda
warning
was
given
before
the
second.
and
third,
it
shows
that
a
time
has
to
have
elapsed
sufficient
to
make
that
miranda
warning
reasonable,
reasonably
cutting
the
causal
connection
that
you
want
it
to
cut.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
not.
you're
right,
but
what
it
does
do
is
provide
a
tremendous
incentive
for
the
police
to
run
around
the
miranda
warning,
and
when
they
run
around
it,
we
could
get
back,
if
they
do
it
enough,
into
the
circumstances
before
miranda
that
were
bad
circumstances
and
called
for
miranda.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
i
think...
or
at
least
mine
is
that
if
you're
talking
psychology,
the
policeman
who
knows
from
nothing,
never
heard
of
miranda,
accidentally
says,
did
you
commit
the
fire?
yes.
okay?
that
statement
doesn't
come
in.
and
then
later
on
he
asks
it
again
after
the
right
warning.
that's
case
one.
case
two.
the
policeman,
knowing
everything
about
miranda,
thinks
to
himself,
ha,
ha,
ha,
i've
got
a
great
trick
here.
did
you
commit
the
crime,
the
fire?
and
then
later
on
he
asks
him
the
question
again
after
warnings.
in
terms
of
the
psychology
of
the
defendant
answering
the
second
time,
whether
that
policeman
was
a
fool
or
a
knave
seems
beside
the
point.
and
so
if
your...
if...
if
your
whole
argument
is
one
of
psychology,
i
don't
get
it.
now,
that's...
maybe
there's
more
to
your
argument
than
just
the
psychology
of
the...
the
criminal
or
the
defendant...
the
criminal
defendant
the
second
time.
and
if
so,
i
want
you
to
respond
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
statements
are
you
talking
about?
the
first
or
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
both,
okay.
how
does
the
first
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
in
fact
you're
worried
about
policemen
subtly
coercing
the
first
statement,
why
do
you
have
to
stop
admission
of
the
second
statement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about...
suppose
our
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
talking
about
the
second
one
now.
sorry.
is
what
you...
were
you
finished?
go
ahead.
finish
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
go
to
the
question
that
i
think
was
presented,
let's
make
my
assumptions
and
let
me
overstate
a
little
bit.
my
first
assumption
is
it's
intolerable
to
have
policemen
going
around
purposely...
purposely...
violating
the
miranda
rule.
now,
assume
that
conclusion,
though
i
know
it's
arguable.
now,
if
that
happens,
if
they
deliberately
and
purposely
have
not
given
these
warnings
when
they
knew
they
should,
that
would
create
a
situation
where
they
might
do
it
a
lot
and
we'd
have
a
lot
of
coerced
confessions
we
couldn't
ever
prove.
okay?
so
i
consider
that...
let's
call
it
bad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if...
if
we
make
that
assumption,
then
the
question
is,
well,
can
the
police,
nonetheless,
introduce
a
second
statement
that
was
done
after
warnings?
now,
there
are
three
possible
positions:
always,
never,
and
sometimes.
so
i'm
exploring
the
sometimes.
now,
i
want
to
know
if...
what
kind
of
a
rule
might
you
think
was
okay
on
the
sometimes.
now,
one
thing
i
thought
of
is
if
they
can
show...
not
you,
but
the
prosecutor
can
show
that
that
first
statement
taken
was
not
coerced
and
that,
second,
they
really
gave
the
warnings
the
second
time,
and
that,
third,
something
happened
to
cut
that
causal
connection
because
the
average
person
would
think,
of
course,
i've
got
to
say
what
i
said
before,
otherwise
they're
going
to
do
something
really
terrible
to
me.
all
right?
so...
so
what...
now,
i'm
looking
for
passage
of
time,
i'm
looking
for
something
else
to
cut
the
causal
connection.
but
i'm
looking
really
for
your
view
on
this.
if
the
answer
is
sometimes,
if
the
answer
is
never,
but
if
it
is
sometimes,
what
kind
of
a
sometimes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
sometimes
you
say
it
could.
now,
what
kinds
of
things
would
dispel
it
and
what
isn't
dispelled
about
your
case?
