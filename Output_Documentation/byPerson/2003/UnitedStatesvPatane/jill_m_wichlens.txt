ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
the
government's
argument
that
miranda
warnings
are
not
a
requirement,
they
may
be
simply
a
matter
of
proving
policy,
but
are
not
a
requirement.
just
three
terms
ago,
this
court
reaffirmed
in
dickerson
that...
and
i'm
quoting
from
dickerson...
miranda
requires
procedures
that
will
warn
a
suspect
in
custody
of
his
right
to
remain
silent,
which
will
assure
the
suspect
that
the
exercise
of
that
right
will
be
honored.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
they
are
seeking
to
admit
the
evidence.
so
if
there
are
two
components
to
a
miranda
violation,
one
being
the
violation
in
the
field
by
the
police
officer,
the
second
component
is
admitting
the
evidence
at
trial,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
government
is
attempting...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
it
is
a
fruits
case,
your
honor.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
correct.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
absolutely,
absolutely.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
it
could
make
a
difference,
and...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
following
up
on
a
question
asked
by
justice
kennedy,
whether,
if
this
is
a
constitutional
violation,
the
derivative
evidence
rule,
the
fruits
rule,
would
apply.
and
my
answer
to
that
is
yes,
absolutely,
under
wong
sun.
if
this
is
a
constitutional
violation,
it
would
apply
in
chavez,
just...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
your
honor,
i'm
speaking
of
wong
sun
for
the
general
proposition
that
when
we
have
a
constitutional
violation,
turning
to
the
fifth
amendment
specifically,
the
amendment
that
we're,
of
course,
concerned
with
here.
in
chavez,
a
plurality...
the
plurality
opinion
in
chavez
made
it
clear
that
if
we
have
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
then
application
of
the
derivative
evidence
rule
is
virtually
automatic.
now,
my
argument
doesn't
rest
entirely
on
the
argument
that
this
is
a
constitutional
violation.
my
first
position
is
that,
if
it
is,
it's
an
automatic
application
of
the
derivative
evidence
rule.
but
even
if
it
is
not,
then
we
go
to
a
balancing
and
we
balance
the
costs,
the
benefits
of
applying
a
derivative
evidence
rule.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
your
honor...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
justice
breyer,
we
need
a
bright
line
in
this
area
of
the
law.
this
court
has
virtually
always
applied
bright
lines,
particularly
in
the
area
of
a
miranda
violation.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
i
think
your
honor's
cases,
which
were,
particularly
in
the
early
years
following
miranda,
have
now
made
those
rules
quite
clear
what
is
interrogation,
what
is
custody...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
well...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
for
the
voluntariness
determination,
it
is
a
fuzzy
totality
of
the
circumstances,
but
no,
in
miranda,
we
apply
bright
lines
determining
whether
there
was
interrogation,
whether
there
was
custody.
we
don't
try
to
get
inside
the
head
of
the
individual
police
officers...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
your
honor...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
the
answer
to
that
is,
drawing
that
bright
line,
if
it
is
one,
your
honor,
i
think
does
require
us
to
get
inside
the
head
of
the
police
officer.
it
requires
us
to
make
determinations
about
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
not.
an
individual
police
officer
may
have
mixed
motives.
we're
not
giving...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
if...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
perhaps,
your
honor,
i...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
perhaps
i
shouldn't
say
bright
line.
what
i
mean
is
objective
versus
subjective,
and
what
i
urge
this
court
not
to
do
is
impose
a
subjective
test,
which
requires
us
to
get
inside
the
head
of
the
police
officer.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
under
an...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
and
if
it
is
an
objective
test,
justice
scalia,
then
in
this
case
the
police
officer
fails
that
test.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
the
record
shows
that
the
detective
said,
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
mr.
patane
said,
i
know
my
rights.
then
the
detective...
and
this
is
the
most
crucial
thing...
is
the
detective
not
only
didn't
go
on
to
read
the
other
very
critical
miranda
rights,
also
didn't
obtain
a
knowing
waiver.
he
didn't...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
correct.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
correct.
what
he
didn't
say...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
what
he
didn't
say
was,
do
you
know
your
right
to
have
counsel
here
present,
mr.
patane?
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
it
is
absolutely
fair
to
require
that
of
a
police
officer.
he
doesn't
have
to
be
a
lawyer,
your
honor.
he
has
to
have
attended
police
academy
101.
you
read
four
warnings
to
a
defendant,
a
suspect,
after
you
arrest
him.
that
is
not...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
correct.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
that's
correct.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
i
think
it
is
approaching
disaster,
your
honor,
and
the
case
that's
going
to
follow
this
one
is
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum.
we
have
lawyers
in
california
going
on
record
instructing
police
officers
to
violate
miranda
on
purpose,
and
they
actually
use
that
word.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
dickerson
has
made
it
clear
it
is
a
command.
miranda...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
i
understand,
your
honor.
the
way
i
read
miranda,
its
progeny,
all
the
way
up
to
dickerson
and
including
dickerson,
which,
of
course,
you,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
the
authority
on,
is
that
there
are
two
components
to
a
miranda
rule.
if
the
exclusion
of
evidence
is
the
core
of
the
rule,
well
then
the
warning
requirement
is
the
rest
of
the
apple.
there
are
two
components
to
the
rule,
and
police
officers
are
being
instructed
out
in
the
field
to
violate,
to
ignore
the
first
part
of
the
rule.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
your
honor,
i
am
trying
to
argue
the
implications
of
this
case.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
understood.
understood,
your
honor.
i
think
we...
we
could
pass
that
test,
and,
of
course,
it
would
need
to
be
sent
back...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
my
preferred
test
is,
you
have
a
miranda
violation,
you
suppress
derivative
evidence.
i
think
that's
the
simplest
rule,
your
honor,
with
all
respect.
but
if
we
do
have
an
objective
reasonableness
test,
in
this
case
and
others
like
it,
it's
not
objectively
reasonable
to
think
you
can
forego
three
of
the
four
miranda
warnings,
and
it's
certainly
not
objectively
reasonable
to
think
that
you
don't
have
to
get
the
suspect
to
waive
those
rights
before
you
go
on.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
no
difference
whatsoever,
your
honor,
none
whatsoever.
the
suspect
is
still
not
informed
of
his
constitutional
rights.
that's
why
i
believe
a
brighter
line,
a
simpler
test,
if
you
will,
your
honor,
is
more
appropriate.
but
even
under
an
objective
reasonableness
test,
the
miranda
violation
in
this
case
was
certainly
not
objectively
reasonable.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
my
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
i
think
the
lower
courts
have
been
mistaken.
what
they
have
done
is
taken
the
language
in
elstad,
and
that
decision,
of
course,
did
include
some
language
about
physical
evidence,
it
was
dicta
in
that
case,
and
that's...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
well,
with
respect,
your
honor...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
with
respect...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
with
respect,
your
honor,
it
makes
things
simpler,
but
it
doesn't
achieve
the
purposes
here
for
the
reasons
that
some
of
the
justices
here
today
have
pointed
out.
in
the
case
of
physical
evidence,
the
physical
evidence
is
the
equivalent
of
the
statements.
the
police
officers...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
that
was
one
of
the
factors.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
well,
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
the
conclusion
there,
because
the
flip
side
of
that
is
the...
the
reliability
of
the
physical
evidence
and
the
fact
that
if
the
police
find
out
where
it
is
through
a
miranda
violation,
they
just
go
and
pick
it
up.
that's
what
makes
physical
evidence
different,
and
that
what...
that
is
what
makes
the
deterrence
factors
different
here.
and
so...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
there's...
there's
no
question.
physical
evidence
is
what
it
is.
i...
i
don't...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
understood.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
other
thing
that's
at
work
in
miranda
and
in
the
fifth
amendment
itself
is
the
notion
that
the
fifth
amendment
isn't
just
a
rule
of
evidence,
just
a
rule
designed
to
ensure
reliable
evidence.
it's
also
a
rule
that
recognizes
that
in
a
free
society,
it's
repugnant
to
the
concepts
of...
concept
of
ordered
liberty
to
compel
a
citizen
to
incriminate
himself.
and
so
that...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
correct.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
because
none
of
those
involve
any
testimonial
aspect
whatsoever,
this
court
has
made
very
clear.
and
so
we
don't
really
have
the
derivative
evidence
rule,
the
fruit
rule,
even
at
issue
in
those
cases.
there's
no
violation
whatsoever
in
those
cases,
your
honor.
there's
no
tree,
so
there
can
be
no
fruit.
here,
we
do
have
a
violation.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
and
we
don't
know
that
he
knew
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
to
be
there
while
detective
benner
was
saying,
you
need
to
tell
us
about
the
gun,
mr.
patane.
i'm
not
sure
i
should
tell
you
about
the
gun,
you
might
take
it
away
from
me.
you
need
to
tell
us
about
the
gun.
if
you
want
to
get
in
front
of
the
domestic
violence
case,
you
need
to
tell
us
about
the
gun.
i
think
that
is...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
it's...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
it...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
what
i'm
talking
about,
your
honor,
are
the
two
bases
underlying
the
fifth
amendment,
going
way
back
now,
not
just
reliability,
but
also
concepts
of,
in
a
free
society,
should
we
compel
people
to
incriminate
themselves?
i
understand
that
there
has
been
a
lot
of
water
under
the
bridge
since
the
framers
came
up
with
the
fifth
amendment,
but
i
was
answering
the
questions
in
terms
of...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
that's
correct.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
here...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
it's
a...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
it's
a...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
it's
a
prophylactic
rule
required
by
the
constitution,
of
course.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
we
don't...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
well,
your
honor,
when
i
pose
that
question
at
cocktail
parties,
people
generally
fall
off
with
the
fourth...
the
fourth
warning.
they
don't
realize
that
they
would
have
a
right
to
counsel
appointed...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
i'm
not
in
any
position
to
pose
the
question
later
in
the
cocktail
party,
your
honor.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
the
importance
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
protects
two
things,
and
miranda,
of
course,
protects
the
fifth
amendment.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
and
if
we
give
the
police
officer
in
the
field
a
pass
to
say,
miranda's
optional,
you
can
do
a
cost-benefit
analysis,
you
can
decide
whether
you
think
the
statements
are
really
what's
going
to
be
important,
or
you
can
decide
that
it's
the
derivative
evidence,
the
fruit
of
those
statements
that's
going
to
be
important.
we
don't
have
much
of
a
rule
at
all.
as
the
tenth
circuit
summed
it
up
very
aptly,
i
think,
quoting
from
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit,
from
a
practical
perspective,
we
see
little
difference
between
the
confessional
statement,
the
glock
is
in
my
bedroom
on
a
shelf,
which
even
the
government
concedes
clearly
excluded
under
miranda
and
wong
sun,
and
the
government's
introduction
of
the
glock
found
in
the
defendant's
bedroom
on
the
shelf.
it's
the
same
thing
in
the
context
of
physical
evidence.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
is...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
the
problem
is,
it
lets
the
individual
officer
on
the
street
decide
whether
he
or
she
is
going
to
give
the
miranda
warnings
in
a
particular
case
or
not.
that's
not
a
rule
that
law
enforcement
is
behind
in,
here
i'm
referring
to
an
amicus
filed
in...
in
the
companion
case
of
seibert.
law
enforcement
doesn't
want
such
a
rule,
if
i
may
be
so
bold
to
say
that,
in
general.
they
don't
want
the
police
officers
to
have
to
be
trained
in
the
police
academy
to
be
a
lawyer
basically,
your
honor,
and
try
to
decide
which
evidence
is
going
to
be
most
important...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
well,
your
honor,
what
i'm
referring
to
there
very
specifically
is
an
amicus
filed
in
the
seibert
case
by
former
law
enforcement
and
prosecution.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
your
honor,
i'm
a
public
defender.
i
can't
speak
for
the
interests
of
law
enforcement.
perhaps
i've
been
presumptuous
to...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
that's...
that's
correct.
prudent
police
officers,
as
i
understood
him
to
say,
will
go
ahead
and
give
the
warnings.
but
we
have
some
very,
if
i
may
say
imprudent
officers
out
there,
at
least
in
missouri
and
california.
we
know
about
those.
and
there
are
now
web
sites
that
police
officers
can
go
on
to
that
instruct
in
this
method,
instruct
police
officers
to
try
to
decide
what's
really
important
in
the
case,
put
themselves
in
the
position
of
the
da,
i
suppose,
and
decide
whether
the
statements
are
really
going
to
make
the
case
or,
in
a
possessory
case,
is
it
the
physical
evidence
that's
really
going
to
make
the
case?
i
mean,
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
that.
the
information
was,
he
keeps
it
on
his
person
or
in
his
car
or
in
his
home.
they're
going
to
investigate
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm
case.
if
they
find
that
firearm
in
his
bedroom
or
in
his
car,
that's
pretty
much
all
she
wrote.
the
prosecution
doesn't
need
a
lot
more.
they
don't
need
the
suspect's
statements
about
where
that
is,
and
so
that's
why
we
can
draw
a
line
between
physical
evidence
and
other
types
of
evidence.
and
if
i
could
add...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
all
right.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
but
violating
miranda.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
but
violating
the
miranda
rule.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
and
we...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
willing
to
assume
there
is
no
compulsion.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
absolutely.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
absolutely.
that
is
the
basic
premise
of
miranda.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
yes.
i
mean,
the...
the
basic
premise,
if
we
want
police
officers
to
comply
with
miranda.
and
if
i
could
say
another
word
about
elstad,
part
of...
a
central
part
of
the
holding
in
elstad,
as
i
understand
it,
was
that
in
that
case,
the
initial
constitutional
violation
is
cured
by
the
time
the
subsequent
statement
comes
around.
in
other
words,
you
have
a
miranda
violation,
the
miranda
warnings
are
not
read,
the
person
is
interrogated,
then
the
miranda
warnings
are
carefully
and
thoroughly
read.
and
as
this
court
stated
in
elstad,
and
i'm
quoting,
a
careful
and
thorough
administration
of
miranda
warnings
serves
to
cure
the
condition
that
rendered
the
unwarned
statements
inadmissible.
we
can't
possibly
have
that
type
of
cure
in
the
case
of
physical
evidence.
when
the
police
officer
is
going
simply
to
seize
the
physical
evidence,
there's
no
curing
of
the
miranda
violation,
and
that's
another
way
that
elstad
is
distinguishable.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
and
you're
speaking
of
the
consent
to
the
search,
your
honor?
because
then
detective
benner...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
your
honor,
because
he
was
under
arrest.
he...
he
had
been
told
he
was
under
formal
arrest.
he
was
in
handcuffs.
and
so
the
miranda
warnings...
the
miranda
warning
requirement
clearly
applied.
and
so
detective
benner
was
not
to
ask
those
questions
without
having
warned
him
first.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
miranda's
not
a
silly
rule,
your
honor.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
it's
not
hard
to
say,
sorry,
pal,
i
have
to
read
them
to
you,
and
even
if
you
don't
want
to
require
the
officer
to
do
that,
how
about,
okay,
pal,
would
you
like
to
waive
those
rights?
that's
an
important
part
of
miranda
law
also:
a,
inform
the
suspect
of
his
rights,
b,
ask
him
if
he
would
like
to
waive
them
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
correct.
although
the
government's
concession
in
the
lower
courts,
district
court
and
tenth
circuit,
is
that
miranda
was
violated
because
there
was
a
lack
of
a
knowing
waiver
of
those
miranda
rights,
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
the
district
court
accepted
the
government's
concession.
but
the...
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
a
miranda
violation,
and
i
believe
repeated
the
language
about
the
waiver
problem.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
your
honor,
simply
that
those
cases
were
mistaken.
this
court
had
never
spoken
directly
on
the
subject
of
derivative
evidence
rule
in
the
context
of
physical
evidence.
and
the
times
have
changed,
your
honor.
the
time
of
elstad
and
some
of
this
court's
cases,
new
york
v.
harris,
that
followed
miranda
most
immediately,
we
all
assumed,
naively
it
turns
out,
that
police
officers
would
at
least
try
to
comply
with
miranda.
and
now
there's
this
movement
afoot
to
basically
thumb
their
noses,
if
you
will,
at
this
court's
miranda
decision
and
say
miranda
is
just
an
option.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
the
state
courts
were
not.
i've
cited
some
cases
in
my
brief,
both
pre-dickerson
and
post-dickerson,
where
the
state
courts
were
not
at
all
uniform.
ms.
jill
m.
wichlens
correct,
your
honor,
as
i
recall.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
the
derivative
evidence
rule
applies
to
physical
evidence
fruit
of
a
miranda
violation
and
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
