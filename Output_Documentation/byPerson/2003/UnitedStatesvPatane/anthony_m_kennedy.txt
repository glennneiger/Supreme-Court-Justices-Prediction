anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
were
to
reject
your
position
and...
and
say
that
this
is
purely
a
constitutional
violation,
would
you
then
lose
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your...
and
why...
why
is
this
different
than
the
rule
under
the
fourth
amendment,
say
wong
sun?
justice
kennedy
that
was
the
trial
court's
opinion,
wasn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
part
of
your...
is...
is
part
of
your
reasoning
that
in
the
fourth
amendment
violation
case,
exclusion
is
the...
really
the
best
available,
most
direct
remedy?
and
in...
and
in
this
case,
there
are
other
remedies,
number
one,
excluding
the
statement,
so
that
when
you...
when
you
find
tangible
evidence,
it's...
it's
just
a...
an
ancillary
and
less
necessary
remedy.
is
that
the
whole...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thrust
of
the
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
this
distinction
that
the...
that...
that
one
case
is
just
more
egregious,
more
an
affront
to
the
constitution,
more
dangerous,
i.e.,
physical
compulsion
as
opposed
to
the
compulsion
that's
just
presumed
from
miranda?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then...
then
you're
back
into
metaphysics.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
think
we
should
differentiate
based
on
the
gravity
of
the...
of
the
wrong
in
either
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
we
tell
juries
they
can
disregard
presumptions,
but
they
can't
disregard
facts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what...
what's
the
magic
about
that
metaphysical
rule
when
we're
talking
about
a
different
amendment
and
a
different
kind
of
statement
or
a
different
kind
of...
a
different
kind
of
evidence
than
is
in
the...
than
the
rule
itself
was
designed
for
primarily?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
we're
just
bound
by
that
metaphysical
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this,
and
i'll...
i'll
go
back
and
read
miranda
to...
to
make
sure.
to
what
extent
was
the
miranda
rule
founded
on
the
concern
that
compelled
statements...
we'll
call
them
that...
are
unreliable?
wasn't
that
a...
a
significant
factor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
when
you
have
tangible
evidence,
then
the
reliability
component
substantially
drops
out
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
makes
the,
what
you
call
dicta
in
elstad,
with
reference
to
physical
evidence,
point
to
a
case
that's
even
easier
than
one...
than
the
one
that
was
in
elstad.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
to
wind
up
the
rhetoric
to
a
high
degree
to
say
that
all
of
society
finds
this
repugnant.
the
man
twice
said
he
didn't
want
his
warnings
and
he
had
a
gun
in
the
house
he
wasn't
supposed
to
have.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
that
might
depend
on
how
late
in
the
cocktail
party.
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
we...
