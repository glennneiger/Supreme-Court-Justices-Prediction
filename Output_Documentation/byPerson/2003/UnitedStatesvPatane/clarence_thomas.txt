justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
in
june
2001,
local
law
enforcement
officials
investigated
whether
respondent,
samuel
francis
patane,
a
convicted
felon,
illegally
possessed
a
firearm
and
whether
he
had
violated
a
restraining
order.
officer
fox
and
detective
benner
proceeded
to
respondent’s
residence
where
after
brief
questioning
relating
to
the
restraining
order,
detective
benner
attempted
to
advice
respondent
of
his
miranda
rights.
respondent
interrupted
asserting
that
he
knew
his
rights.
neither
officer
attempted
to
complete
the
warning.
detective
benner
asked
about
the
firearm
and
respondent
told
him
that
his
pistol
was
in
his
bedroom
and
gave
him
permission
to
retrieve
it.
a
federal
grand
jury
indicted
respondent
for
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
convicted
felon.
the
district
court
granted
respondent’s
motion
to
suppress
the
gun
reasoning
that
the
officers
lack
probable
cause
for
arresting
respondent
for
violating
the
restraining
order.
it
therefore,
did
not
need
to
rule
on
his
alternative
argument
that
the
gun
should
be
suppressed
as
a
fruit
of
an
unwarned
statement.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court’s
ruling
with
respect
to
probable
cause
but
affirmed
the
suppression
order
on
respondent’s
alternative
theory.
the
court
rejected
the
government’s
argument
that
this
court’s
decision
in
oregon
versus
elstad
and
michigan
versus
tucker
foreclosed
the
application
of
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
to
the
present
context.
these
holdings,
the
court
of
appeals
have
reasoned,
were
based
on
a
view
that
miranda
announced
the
prophylactic
rule
a
view
that
that
court
could
not
reconcile
with
our
decision
in
dickerson
versus
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
thereby
equated
dickinson’s
announcement
that
miranda
is
a
constitutional
rule
with
the
proposition
that
a
failure
to
warn
pursuant
to
miranda
is
itself
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
i
have
written
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
announcing
the
judgment
of
the
court
to
reverse.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined
that
opinion;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
o’connor
has
joined;
justice
suoter
has
filed
a
descending
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
ginsburg
have
joined;
justice
breyer
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
