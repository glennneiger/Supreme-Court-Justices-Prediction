justice

is
it
a
fifth
amendment
right
or
not
a
fifth
amendment
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
has
to
be
based
on
something
in
the
constitution.
we
would
have
had
to
respect
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
in
dickerson.
so
it
is...
there
is
obviously
some
provision
of
the
constitution
that
enabled
us
to
disregard
that
statute.
what...
what
provision
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
it's
a
fifth
amendment
right
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
it's
prophylactic
or
not,
it
is
a
constitutional
right,
is
it
not?
it
is
a
constitutional
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
is
the
constitutional
right
not
to
be
pistol-whipped
in
order
to...
to
confess.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
distinct
from
the
introduction
of
the
coerced
confession
at
trial,
but
we
don't
distinguish
between
the
two,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me...
let
me
take
out
the
pistol-whipping.
it...
it...
it
is
a
coerced
statement
because
of
the
application
of
mental
coercion.
now,
that
is
not
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
i
suppose,
until
the
product
of
the...
of
the
coercion
is
introduced
at
trial.
will
you
say
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we...
we
apply
in
this
area,
as
regrettably
in
a
lot
of
others,
what
we
call
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
do
you
call
that
a
bright
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the
fuzziest
of
all
lines.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're...
we're...
we're
saying
whether
a
reasonable
police
officer
in
the...
in
the
position
of
this
police
officer,
would
have...
would
have
made
the
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as...
just
as
you
say,
you
say
for
custody
we
apply
a
bright
line.
we
don't
apply
a
bright
line
for
custody.
the
test
for
custody
is
whether...
whether
a...
a
reasonable
person
would
have
believed,
given
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
that
he
was
free
to
leave.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
is
anything
but
bright.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
we
can
apply
objective...
an
objective
test
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
a
reasonable
police
officer
in
the
position
of
this
police
officer
would...
would
have
been
confused
about
the
necessity
of
giving
a
miranda
warning,
then
you're...
we're
at
a
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
the
difference
is
miranda
doesn't
assume
compulsion.
you're
talking
as
though
miranda...
miranda
is
a
compulsion
case.
it
isn't.
it...
it's
a
prophylactic
rule,
even
when
there
has
been
no
compulsion...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
but
you
can't
make
your
argument
as
though
what's
at
issue
here
is
compulsion
and
our
society
has
set
its
face
against...
against
the
use
of
anything
obtained
by
compulsion.
there...
there
is
not
necessarily
compulsion.
in
fact,
there
usually
isn't
compulsion
simply
because
a
miranda
warning
is...
is
not
given.
i
expect
this...
this...
this
individual
in
this
case
did
indeed
know
his
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
think
probably
most
of
the
people
in
this
room
could
read...
could...
could
recite
miranda
just
from...
just
from
listening
to
it
on
television
so
often.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
the
latter
you
know
is
true.
the
former
may...
may
have
been
the
product
of
coercion
and
be
false.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
i
mean,
that's
a
big
difference
if
you
think
the
primary
purpose
of
miranda
is
to
prevent
false
testimony
from...
from
being
introduced,
then
it
seems
to
me
quite
reasonable
to
say
that
police
can
indeed
make
the
choice,
do
i
want
to
use
this
testimony.
if
i
don't
want
to
use
this
testimony,
i
won't
give
a
miranda
warning,
and
anything
the
testimony
leads
to,
if
it
leads
to
anything,
i...
i
don't
know
how
the
police
will
always
know
that...
that
it
will
lead
to
something,
so
i...
i
think
it's
a...
a
pretty
high
risk
enterprise.
but
what's...
what's
wrong
with
it
if...
if
you
think
the
primary...
the
primary
function
of
miranda
is
to
prevent
browbeaten
statements
by...
by...
by
confused
people
in
custody
who...
who
confess
mistakenly?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
just
a
silly
rule,
isn't
it?
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it...
it
is
when
the
person
says,
i
know
my
right.
what
if
he
stuck
his
fingers
in
his
ears,
saying,
i
don't
want
to
hear
them,
i
don't
want
to
hear
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
have
to
read
it
to
him
anyway?
