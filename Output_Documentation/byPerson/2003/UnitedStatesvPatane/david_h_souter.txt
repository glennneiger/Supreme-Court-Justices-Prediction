mr....
the...
the
difficulty
that
i
have
accepting
that
as
the
final
answer
is
that
there
isn't
any
functional
difference
in
a
case
like
this
between
admitting
the
statement,
the
admission
that
he
had
the
gun
on
the
shelf
in
the
bedroom,
and
admitting
the
gun.
so
that,
in
functional
terms,
the...
the
miranda
protection,
even
as
you
describe
it,
disappears
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
think
the
gun
on
the
shelf
in
the
guy's
bedroom
is
going
to
be
sufficient
to
prove
knowing
possession?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
know
what's
in
your
bedroom.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
terrible
cost,
but
it's
a
terrible
cost
for
which
the
law
provides
a
ready
means
of
avoidance.
i
mean,
miranda's
been
around
for
a
long
time.
there
is...
there's
no
excuse
at
this
point
in
our
history
for
the
police
to
say,
gee,
i...
i
don't
quite
understand
what
miranda
is
getting
at.
and...
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
the
cost
argument
is
a
weak
one...
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
a...
let
me
just
finish
this
sentence.
and
as
against
that
weak
argument,
there
seems
to
me
a
fairly
strong
argument
that
if
you
accept
your
position,
there
is
a,
in...
in
effect,
a
recipe
for
disregarding
miranda,
because
in
every
physical
evidence
case,
as
in
justice
ginsburg's
examples,
there's
going
to
be
an
inducement
to
say,
never
mind
the
statement,
just
get
the
evidence,
the
evidence
will
take
care
of
the
case.
so
i...
it...
it...
it's
seems
to
me
that
we
got
a
weak
argument
on
one
side
and
a
strong
argument
on
the
other
side.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
costs
are
quite
real,
but
the
state
knows
how
to
avoid
having
to
pay
those
costs.
it
gives
the
warning.
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
why
do
we
have...
if
that's
the
case,
why
do
we
have
a
case
coming
up
in...
in
a
few
minutes
in
which
a...
a
contrary
policy
has
been
adopted?
i
mean,
it...
your...
your
statement
that...
that
the
police
have
much
to
gain
and
much
to
lose
if...
if...
if
they...
if
they
follow
the
practice
of
avoiding
the
warnings
is...
is
not
intuitively
clear
this
morning.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
there
was
a
policy
to
roll
the
dice.
justice
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i...
i'm...
i'm
sure
that
that
is
the
fbi
policy,
but
it...
the
point
is,
there
is
a
substantial,
apparently
a
substantial
body
of
thought
outside
the
fbi
within
american
law
enforcement
that
dice-rolling
pays
off.
