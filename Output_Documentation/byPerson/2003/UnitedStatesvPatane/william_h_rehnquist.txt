chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
02-1183,
the
united
states
v.
samuel
francis
patane.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
dreeben,
supposing
that
the
police
decide
that
they're
going
to
follow
this
strategy
that
is
perhaps
suggested
by
justice
ginsburg.
would
that
itself
be
evidence
of
compulsion?
in
other
words,
they
won't
give
miranda
warnings
and
see...
see
what
the
person
says,
then
they
give
them.
would
that
be
evidence
of
compulsion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
said
last
year
in
chavez
that
the
miranda...
that
the
constitution
was
not
violated
by
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings
until
they
were
offered
in
evidence,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
that...
i
believe
to...
you're
taking
all
the
opinions
together.
there
were
six
votes
for
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
ms.
wichlens,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
i
think,
ms.
wichlens,
if
you
read
through
the
entire
opinion
in
dickerson,
it's
clear
that
the
warnings
are
required
in
order
to
make
the
statements
admissible.
they
don't
say
that
mere
failure
to
give
the
warnings
without
seeking
to
follow
up
with
admission
is
a
constitutional
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we've
had...
we've
had,
ms.
wichlens,
probably
somewhere
between
40
and
50
cases
since
miranda
was
decided,
deciding
was
this
interrogation
or
was
it
not,
was
this
custody
or
was
it
not.
there
are
factual
disputes
about
every
single
aspect
of
miranda.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
violate,
miranda,
miranda
is...
is
not
a
command
that
prohibits
police
officers,
or
that
requires
police
officers
to
give
the
statements.
it's
a...
it's
a...
it's
a
conditional
thing.
unless
they
give
the
statements,
the
stuff
can't
be
admitted
in
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think...
well,
i
think,
having
written
dickerson,
i
think
differently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're...
and
you're
entitled
to
read
the
opinion
as
you
wish.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so...
so
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned,
what...
what
difference
does
it
make
to
him
whether
the
officer's
failure
to
give
the
warnings
was
intentional
or
just
negligent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
is
your
authority,
ms.
wichlens,
for
saying
that
law
enforcement
doesn't
want
this
sort
of
a
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
think
they
represent
the
views
of,
quote,
law
enforcement,
closed
quote,
generally?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption,
the
government's
question
that
there
was
a
failure
to
give
a
suspect
the
miranda
warnings
here,
do
we
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
court
of
appeals...
what
did
the
court
of
appeals...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wichlens.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1183,
united
states
against
patane
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
