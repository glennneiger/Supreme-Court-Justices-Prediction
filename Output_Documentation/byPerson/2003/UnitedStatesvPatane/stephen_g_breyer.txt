justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
threat
of
contempt,
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
theory
of
the
compulsion?
that
is,
what...
why,
assuming
that
there's
compulsion
but
there
hasn't
been
an
introduction
of
the
statement
that
was
compelled
into
evidence.
under
that...
and
suppose
that
the
compulsion
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
the
due
process
violation.
i
mean,
i...
maybe...
maybe
they
all
do,
but...
but
if
they
don't,
then
what's
the
theory
of
keeping
out
the
evidence
derived
from
that
sort
of
compulsion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
doesn't
all
that
apply
here?
i
mean,
is...
is
that...
i
can
understand
it
if
they
compel
the
testimony,
then
you
introduce
it.
then...
then
you
have
the
completed
violation
of
what
the
fifth
amendment
forbids,
all
right,
the
completed
violation.
i
can
understand
it
if
you
compel
the
person
to
the
extent
that
it
violates
the
due
process
clause,
beating
him
up
severely,
whatever.
now,
i
don't
understand
why,
if
you
have
neither
of
those
two
things,
you
would
keep
the
evidence
that's
the
fruits
out,
under
some
theory
that
doesn't
also
say
you
should
keep
this
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
would
there
be
any
cost
here
to
anything
if
you
took
the
position,
as
we
might
take,
that
if
a
policeman
goes
in
and
purposely
doesn't
give
the
warnings
when
he
knows
that
he
should,
or
even
if
he
reasonably
should
know
and
doesn't,
we're
not
going
to
let
in
derivatives.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
the
unusual
case,
we're
quite...
it
was
an
honest
mistake,
as
it
could
be
here,
because
he
tried
to
give
the
warnings
and
the
defendant
said,
no,
no,
i
know
what
they
are,
okay.
so...
so
what
cost,
if...
if...
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
brightest
line,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
if
the
policeman
knew
or
should
have
known
that
he
was
supposed
to
give
a
warning,
fine,
the
evidence
stays
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
now
all
we're
excluding,
we're
just
letting
in
evidence
in
those
cases
where
it
genuinely
is
fuzzy
and
no
policeman
knows
what
he's
supposed
to
do,
or...
or
it's
at
least
reasonable
for
him
not
to
know.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
what
you
do
is
lose
evidence,
lose
evidence
that
could
be
useful
in
convicting
a
criminal,
and
what
you
gain
is
precisely
nothing,
since
the
policeman,
by
definition,
was
confused
about
the
matter
and
reasonably
so.
now,
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
wait,
you
left
out...
he
said
it
twice,
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
patane
says,
i
know
my
rights.
the
detective
says,
you
know
your
rights?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the...
patane
says,
yeah,
yeah,
i
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
my
rights.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
understand
that
a
lawyer
might
have...
who
really
knows
this
area,
might
have
understood
that
you
have
to
do
more
than
that.
but
is
it
fair
to
ask
a
policeman
who's
on
the
line
of
duty
when
he
tries
twice
to
read
him
the
rights,
and
each
time
the
defendant
says,
no,
i
know
them,
forget
it.
is
it
fair
to
ask
the
policeman
to
be
the
lawyer
who
has
to
know
you
have
to
go
and
get
out
a
paper
and
have
him
sign
it
and
so
forth?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
why
i
raised
the
point,
because
it
seems
to
me
you
could
have
one
simple
rule
maybe.
i'm
just
tying...
trying
it
out
for
all
these
cases.
you
say
if
the
policeman
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known,
well,
we're
talking
about
derivative
evidence,
not...
not
the
evidence
itself,
but
derivative...
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known,
keep
it
out.
but
if
in
fact
it
was
really
an
honestly
borderline
thing,
at
least
if
we're
talking
about
derivative,
then
no,
you
don't
have
to
keep
it
out.
now,
that's
simple
and
we'd
send
yours
back
maybe
to
find
out
whether
he
reasonably
knew
or
should
have
known,
et
cetera.
and
i'm
testing
it
on
you.
i
want
to
see
what
your
reaction
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh
no,
i'm
not...
i
don't...
i'm
not
so
interested
whether
you
pass
it
or
not
if
you
don't
have
to.
but
i'm
interested
in
what
you
think
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
half
the
problem
is
that
that
isn't...
i
mean,
it
begs
the
question
to
say
that
that's
contrary
to
established
ordered
liberty,
et
cetera,
because
that
is
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everybody,
i
guess,
agrees
that
it
does
violate
those
basic
principles
to
permit
questioning
of
the
person,
compel
a
statement
and
then
introduce
that
statement
into
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
apparently,
for
many,
many
years,
people
haven't
agreed
under
the
same
circumstances
that
it
violates
ordered
liberty
to
get
a
statement
and
get
physical
evidence
and
introduce
the
physical
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
lot
of
it
was
that
the
police
used
to
beat
people
up,
say,
they
beat
people
up.
now,
that's
very
repulsive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
answer
to
that
is
that
if
they
come
even
close
to
that,
we'll
keep
the
statement
out
and
we
will
also
keep
the
fruits
out.
justice
breyer
we
keep
it
out...
justice
breyer
we
keep
it
out.
justice
breyer
so
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
we're
going
to
the
same
thing...
let's
suppose
they
found
out
about
that
gun
without
compelling
anything,
no
compulsion...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
testifying
against
yourself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
didn't
omit...
they
omitted
the
miranda
warning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
miranda
warning
is
a
way
of
stopping
the
compulsion.
but
if
you're
willing
to
assume
there
is
no
compulsion,
what's
so
horrible
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
well
if
there
is...
then
what
you've
got
is
miranda
as
a
way
of
getting
at
instances
where
there
is
compulsion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
apply
to
the
physical
evidence
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wait,
can
i...
if
you
have
a
minute.
what
if
the
policeman
deliberately
fails
to
give
the
miranda
warning
in
order
to
get
the
physical
evidence?
