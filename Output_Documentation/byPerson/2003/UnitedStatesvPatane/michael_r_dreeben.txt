mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
this
court's
decision
in
dickerson
v.
united
states
in
the
year
2000,
it
was
the
uniform
rule
in
the
lower
federal
courts
that
the
failure
to
issue
miranda
warnings
meant
that
the
unwarned
statement
was
not
admissible
in
the
government's
case,
but
that
there
was
no
requirement
to
suppress
physical
evidence
that
was
derived
from
those
unwarned
statements.
following
this
court's
decision
in
dickerson,
which
affirmed
that
miranda
has
constitutional
stature,
the
majority
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
to
address
the
issue
continued
to
adhere
to
the
pre-dickerson
rule
that
physical
fruits
of
an
unwarned
statement
were
admissible.
in
this
case,
the
tenth
circuit
broke
ranks
with
that
uniform
body
of
authority
and
held
that,
as
a
result
of
dickerson's
ruling
that
miranda
has
constitutional
stature,
there
is
a
derivative
fruits
suppression
component
to
the
miranda
rule.
that
holding
should
be
reversed.
miranda
stands
as
a
rule
that
implements
the
fifth
amendment,
not
by
requiring
the
compulsion
that
the
amendment
literally
speaks
of,
but
by
providing
an
extra
level
of
protection
for
the
core
of
the
fifth
amendment
right,
the
right
for
the
defendant's
own
statements
that
are
incriminating
not
to
be
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
a
right
that
implements
the
fifth
amendment's
protection.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
fifth
amendment.
what
the...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
the
court
concluded
in
miranda
and
then
reaffirmed
in
dickerson
is
that
the
traditional
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
for
ascertaining
whether
a
statement
is
voluntary
or
has
been
compelled
by
the
government
is
not
adequate
when
the
statements
are
taken
in
the
inherently
pressuring
environment
of
custodial
interrogation.
and
to
provide
an
extra
layer
of
protection
to
avoid
the
violation
of
the
defendant's
fifth
amendment
rights,
the
court
adopted
a
prophylactic
warnings
and
wavier
procedure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
it
is
a
constitutional
right
that
is
distinct
from
the
right
not
to
have
one's
compelled
statements
used
against
oneself.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
oh,
i
think
you
do,
justice
scalia.
that
is
a
violation
of
the
core
due
process
right
not
to
have
substantive
violations
of
one's
liberty
interests.
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
not
a
substantive
violation
of
the
defendant's
rights,
but
a
procedural
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
this
court
has
defined
in
miranda,
but
has
defined
it
in
a
way
that
is
highly
distinct
from
the
basic,
textually-mandated
rule
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
compelled
statements
may
not
be
used.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would...
i'm
not
sure,
justice
scalia,
that
your
question
addresses
what
miranda
addressed.
what
miranda
addressed
was
a
situation
in
which
it
was
extremely
difficult
for
the
courts
to
sort
out
whether
a
statement
was
coerced
or
not
coerced,
and
to
avoid
the
risk
that
an
actually
coerced
statement
would
be
used
in
evidence
against
the
defendant,
thus
violating
the
core
fifth
amendment
right.
the
miranda
court,
as
this
court
has
later
explained,
adopted
a
presumption,
a
presumption
for
a
limited
purpose.
in
the
government...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
presupposes
an
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
and
actual
compulsion
of
the...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
information,
presumably
under
a
grant
of
immunity,
then
the
gun
would
not
be
admissible,
because
this
court
has
defined
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
involves
actual
compulsion
as
entailing
two
different
evidentiary
consequences.
one
evidentiary
consequence
is
that
the
statements
themselves
may
not
be
used.
the
other
evidentiary
consequence
is
that
nothing
derived
from
the
statements
may
be
used.
but
the
critical
feature
of
that
hypothetical
and
its
distinction
from
miranda,
is
it
involves
actual
compulsion.
miranda...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
does,
justice
ginsburg,
and
there
are
many
things
in
the
miranda
opinion
that
have
not
stood
the
test
of
later
litigation
in
this
court,
because
they
extended
the
implications
of
miranda
far
beyond
where
this
court
has
gone.
and
let
me
be
precise
about
this.
the
rule,
at
the
time
of
miranda
and
today,
is
that
if
there
is
actual
compulsion,
the
government
may
not
make
use
of
the
actual
statements
that
are
taken
or
their
evidentiary
fruits.
the
government
may
also
not
use
that
statement
for
impeachment,
and
there
is
no
public
safety
exception
that
could...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
o'connor,
the
determination
of
whether
the
statements
reflect
voluntariness
at
the
outset
and
then
a
knowing
and...
and
intelligent
waiver
of
miranda
warnings
later
on
after
they
are
given
needs
to
be
determined
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
but
this
court
has
recognized,
in
allowing
the
use
of
unwarned
statements
for
impeachment
and
in
adopting
the
public
safety
exception,
and
in
permitting
a
second
warned
statement,
as
the
court
did
in
oregon
v.
elstad,
to
be
admitted
into
evidence,
notwithstanding
an
earlier
unwarned
statement,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
miranda
presumption
and
a
finding
of
actual
compulsion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
we
still
do,
because
the
crucial
thing
about
miranda
that
is
not
challenged
here
is
that
a
failure
to
issue
miranda
warnings,
followed
by
custodial
interrogation,
means
that
the
unwarned
statement
is
inadmissible
in
the
government's
case
in
chief.
that
is
the
core
ruling
of
miranda.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
the
core
ruling
of
the
public
safety
exception
is
that
you
can
use
the
statement.
the
court
held,
in
new
york
v.
quarles,
that
when
pressing
public
safety
needs
justify
the
conduct
of
custodial
interrogation
without
prior
issuance
of
miranda
warnings,
that
situation
falls
outside
of
the
miranda
paradigm,
and
the
statements
themselves
can
be
used.
now,
justice
o'connor's
dissenting
opinion
argued
that
there
should
be
no
exception
for
public
safety
for
the
statements
themselves,
but
the
gun,
as
derivative
evidence,
should
come
in,
because
it
was
not
the
product
of
actual
compulsion
at
which
the
fifth
amendment
is
aimed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
souter,
if...
if
i
accept
that
that
accurately
describes
this
case,
it
does
not
accurately
describe
the
large
class
of
cases
in
which
physical
evidence
is
discovered
as
a
result
of
unwarned
statements.
in
many...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
my
position,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
prudent
policy
for
law
enforcement
to
adopt.
this
case
may
be
one
in
which
the
government
can
prove
knowing
possession
of
a
firearm
by
the
defendant
even
without
the
benefit
of
his
statements,
but
police
officers
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
predict
in
advance
that
that
is
going
to
be
true
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases.
what
they
are
going
to
know
is
that
if
you
have
a
statement
that
links
the
defendant
to
the
gun,
that
allows
you
to
show
knowing
possession.
in
the
absence
of
that,
having
the
physical
evidence
alone
will
not
necessarily
guarantee
a
conviction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
oh,
i
do
in
this
case,
justice
souter.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
court
should
decide
this
case
not
based
on
the
particularities
of
this
factual
scenario,
but
on
the
class
of
cases
in
which
physical
evidence
is
at
issue,
and
should
regard
the
question
of
what
incentives
the
police
may
have
as
informed
by
the
totality
of
cases
that
may
arise.
police
officers
who
decide
to
conduct
custodial
interrogation
without
giving
miranda
warnings
know
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
use
the
statements
that
the
defendant
makes
in
the
government's
case
in
chief,
and
they
have
no
way
of
knowing
before
they
conduct
custodial
interrogation
what
the
defendant
may
say.
if
the
defendant
offers
up
information
that
is
incriminating
on
unanticipated
crimes
or
provides
leads
to
information
that
the
police
haven't
previously
anticipated,
then
the
police
officers
run
two
risks.
the
first
is
that
they
won't
be
able
to
use
those
statements
against
the
defendant
in
the
case
in
chief.
the
second
is
that
by
failing
to
issue
miranda
warnings,
they
increase
the
likelihood
that
a
later
court
reviewing
the
facts
will
conclude
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
mere
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings,
but
is
a
case
involving
actual
compulsion.
and
if
a
court
concludes
that
the
statements
are
actually
compelled,
involuntary...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would
be
evidence
that
a
defendant
could
argue
is
relevant,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
evidence
of
compulsion.
what's
relevant
in
the
compulsion
analysis
is
what
the
police
officers
actually
say
and
do
and
communicate
to
the
suspect.
their
uncommunicated
intent
or
law
enforcement
policies
would
not
add
up
to
compulsion
by
itself.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
kennedy.
the
court
should
still
do
as
it
has
done
in
other
contexts,
balance
the
costs
of
a
miranda
suppression
remedy
against
whatever
incremental
benefits
there
may
have.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
the
court
has
done
in
the
fourth
amendment
context
is
deal
with
an
actual
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
establish
very
exclusion...
various
exclusionary
rules
that
are
designed
to
deter
that
kind
of
police
conduct.
the
miranda
rule
is
very
different,
because
even
if
the
court
holds
that
miranda
prescribes
a
rule
of
substantive
conduct
for
the
police,
which
we
submit
it
does
not,
even
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that,
it
still
is
a
rule
that
merely
presumes
compulsion.
it
doesn't
constitute
a
finding
of
actual
compulsion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
what
the
court
has
done
under
the
fifth
amendment...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
this
court
will
be
better
able
than
i
am
to
say
what
chavez
held.
[laughter]
but
the...
the
reason
that
that
principle
alone
does
not
decide
this
case
is
that
the
court
has,
in
instances
of
actual
compulsion
out
of
court,
applied
a
derivative
evidence
suppression
rule.
that's
the
rule
that
the
court
adopted
in
counselman
v.
hitchcock,
and
it's
followed
it
in
its
immunity
line
of
cases
where
it
has
held
that
to
displace
the
fifth
amendment
right
against
compelled
self-incrimination,
you
need
to
suppress
both
the
statement
and
the
fruits.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
that's...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
the
core
of
it,
justice
kennedy.
what
the
court
did
in
miranda
was
create
a
rule
that
operates
in
the
very
heart
of
the
fifth
amendment
by
creating
a
prophylactic
buffer
zone
against
the
risk,
not
the
certainty,
but
the
risk,
that
actual
compulsion
has
been
exacted.
it
is
that
risk
that
the
fifth
amendment
targets
as
the
core
concern.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
as
the
court
explained
it
in
its
immunity
line
of
cases,
the
starting
point
of
analysis
is
that
a
defendant
under
the
fifth
amendment
can
claim
his
privilege
against
testifying
based
not
only
on
incrimination
from
the
statements
that
he
makes,
but
also
that
evidence
that
the
government
can
obtain
as
a
result
of
the
statements
is
incriminating.
if
his
testimony
is
a
link
in
a
chain
of
incrimination,
he
can
stand
silent,
and
the
court
reasoned
from
that
that
the
government
should
not
be
able
to
circumvent
that
right
of
the
defendant
not
to
be
a
witness
against
his...
himself,
by
calling
him
out
of
court,
compelling
testimony
over
his
objection
that...
based
on
the
fifth
amendment,
and
then
obtaining
the
very
incriminating
information
that
the
privilege
shielded
him
from
having
to
provide.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the...
the
distinction
between
this
situation
and
the
true
compulsion
situation
is,
miranda
does
not
involve
an
actual
finding
of
compulsion,
and
the
court
has
been
very
frank
about
this.
as
a
result,
the
court
has
repeatedly
drawn
distinctions
between
the
use
of
unwarned
statements
and
the
use
of
actually
compelled
statements.
actually
compelled
statements
may
not
be
used
to
impeach
a
defendant's
trial
testimony.
that
too
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
right.
but
the
court
held
in...
in
the
hass
case
and
in
the
harris
case
that
statements
that
are
merely
unwarned,
but
not
compelled,
can
be
used
for
impeachment.
the
court
similarly
held
in
michigan
v.
tucker
and
then
again
in
oregon
v.
elstad
that
statements
that
are
unwarned,
but
not
compelled,
can
be
used
as
leads
to
find
another
witness'
testimony,
or
to
obtain
a
second
statement
from
the
defendant
himself.
and
if...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
one
case,
justice
kennedy,
involves
a
literal
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
miranda
involves
a
presumption
that
this
court...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
a
little
metaphysical,
justice
kennedy,
but
there's
a...
a
pot
of
truth,
i
think,
a
pot
of
gold
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
here,
which
is
that
the
miranda
presumption
does
not
mean,
this
court
has
held,
that
a
statement
is
actually
compelled.
it
protects
against
the
most
crucial
right
contained
in
the
fifth
amendment
itself,
which
is...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you
could
look
at
it
that...
that
way,
justice
kennedy.
what...
what
the
court
has
done
when
it's
dealt
with
a...
a
failure
to
issue
warnings,
is
balance.
it
has
recognized
that,
by
providing
a
rule
that
presumes
compulsion
in
lieu
of
proving
it,
the
court
has
taken
a
step
beyond
the
core
of
the
constitutional
right
itself,
and
the
court's
language
in
its
previous
cases
of
calling
miranda
warnings
and
the
exclusionary
rule
under
miranda
a
prophylactic
right
is
understandable
in
that
sense.
miranda
excludes
some
statements
that
are
not
compelled
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i...
i...
i
don't
want
to
go
off
into
an
excursion
into
rules
of
law
that
might
occur
to
me
as
i
stand
here,
justice
stevens.
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
court's
own
miranda
jurisprudence...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
is
language
in
the
miranda
opinion,
as
justice
ginsburg
has
mentioned,
that
would
support
the
view
that
the
original
vision
of
miranda
was
that
it
would
constitute
compulsion...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
merely
presume
it.
but
as
the
court
developed
the
rule
and
considered
what
the
costs
and
benefits
would
be
of
having
a
rule
that
merely
presumed
compulsion,
any
context
in
which
it
was
not
necessarily
true.
the
miranda
court
itself
recognized
that
not
all
statements
taken
in
custodial
interrogation
without
warnings
are
compelled.
once
you
are
dealing
with
a
prophylactic
rule,
it's
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
balance
the
benefits
against
the
burdens
of
the
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
court
has
put
itself
back
into
it
by
adopting
the
holdings
that
permit
statements
that
are
not
warned
to
be
used
for
impeachment
and
to
be
used
to
obtain
leads
for
other
witnesses.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
i
think
that
that's
what
the
court
has
really
decided
is
the
right
approach
when
you
are
outside
the
core
concern
that
the
miranda
court
was
addressing,
namely
the
use
of
the
unwarned
statement
itself.
there
is
a
terrible
cost
to
the
truth-seeking
function
of
a
criminal
trial
to
suppress
reliable,
physical
evidence
that
was
obtained
not
as
the
result
of
a
core
constitutional
violation
involving
literal
compulsion
or
a
substantive
due
process
violation,
but
merely
a
failure
to
issue
warnings.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there...
i...
the
argument
based
on
cost,
justice
souter,
is...
is
not
weak,
because
the
costs
are
quite
real.
the
jury
does
not
hear
the
evidence
that's
suppressed...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
though
that
there
are
situations
in
which
there
are
ambiguities
in
the
way
that
miranda
actually
applies,
and
law
enforcement
officers
are
going
to
make
mistakes
in
the
way
that
they
apply
miranda.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
our
position
is
that
if
they
don't
give
the
warnings
up
front,
they
lose
the
statement
that
is
taken
without
warnings.
that
is
the
miranda
rule,
and
it
responds
to
the
core
concern
that
miranda
had.
the
question
is,
how
much
further
should
that
rule
go?
and,
as
i
think
i
answered
justice
souter
and
yourself
earlier,
police
officers
do
not
know
before
they
get
hold
of
evidence
whether
they
are
going
to
be
able
to
link
it
to
the
defendant
with
other
admissible
evidence
and
prove
the
violation
at
trial.
they
are
much
better
off
following
the
miranda
script,
getting
the
admissible
evidence
of...
of
the
defendant's
own
statements,
and
using
it
to
tie
the
defendant
to
the
evidence.
and
in
a
large
percent...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
souter,
i
think
as
the
court
will
hear
more
in
the
next
hour,
the...
the
officer
in
that
case
acknowledged
that
he
was
rolling
the
dice.
there
are
many
reasons
why...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
officer
testified
that
he
had
been
trained
to
do
that...
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
he
decided
that...
that
he
would
in
that
case.
the
fbi
policy
has
been,
even
before
miranda
and
continuing
to
this
day,
that
you
issue
the
warnings.
you
avoid
difficult
voluntariness
inquiries,
you
smooth
the
path
to
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
you
ensure
that
the
warned
statements
are
admissible.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it...
i
think
that
in
many
cases
it
pays
off
with
risks
that
responsible
law
enforcement
officers
often
choose
not
to
run.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
miranda
is
a
rule
that
is
perfectly
matched
to
the
problem
that
the
court
sought
to
address,
namely
the
risk
that
the
defendant's
own
self-incriminating
statements
would
be
obtained
by
compulsion
and
admitted
against
him
to
prove
his
guilt.
that
risk
implicated
two
central
concerns
of
the
fifth
amendment,
one
going
to
reliability,
the
other
going
to
the
state's
burden
to
prove
guilt
with
evidence
other
than
that
extracted
from
the
defendant's
own
mouth.
extension
of
miranda
to
this
case,
which
involves
physical
evidence
that
does
not
involve
the
reliability
concerns
that
are
at
the
heart
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
does
not
involve
the
concern
about
using
the
defendant's
own
self-compelled
words
to
incriminate
him,
would
not
only
be
contrary
to
the
body
of
authority
in
the
lower
courts
before
this
court's
decision
in
dickerson
and
largely
after
it,
but
would
also
be
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
truth-seeking
in
a
criminal
trial
that
is
central
to
the
court's
jurisprudence
in
this
area.
justice
stevens,
i...
as
far
as
the
government
is
aware,
there
was
no
more
than
a
handful
of
cases
in
the
state
courts
that
have
followed
the
rule,
other
than
what
the
federal
rule
had
been.
justice
white's
dissenting
opinion
from
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
the
patterson
case,
i
believe,
collects
them,
but
this
was
by
no
means
a
groundswell
movement
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
my
understanding
is
that
there
are
eight
federal
circuits
before
dickerson,
including
the
tenth
circuit,
that
it
held
that
suppression
of
derivative
physical
evidence
was
not
warranted.
since
dickerson,
only
the
tenth
circuit
has
changed
its
position,
and
there
is
no
other
court,
other
than
the
first
circuit,
which
follows
a
rule
that
depends
on...
on
balancing
deterrence
concerns
against
the
loss
to...
of
evidence
to
the
trial,
that
follows
anything
akin
to
the
kind
of
derivative
suppression
rule
that
the
tenth
circuit
adopted
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
our
view,
justice
breyer,
no
different
rule
is
warranted
in
that
situation,
because
miranda
continues
to
protect
against
the
risk
that
it's
aimed
at.
absent
actual
compulsion,
there
is
no
warrant
for
a
rule
that
does
anything
other
than
suppress
the
actual
statements.
