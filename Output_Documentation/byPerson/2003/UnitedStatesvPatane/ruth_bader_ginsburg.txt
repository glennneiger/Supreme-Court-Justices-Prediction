mr.
dreeben...
mr....
miranda
itself
said,
but
unless
and
until
such
warnings
and
waivers
are
demonstrated
by
the
prosecution
at
trial,
no
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
interrogation
can
be
used
against
him,
no
evidence
as
a
result
of
interrogation.
that
sounds
like
a...
a...
a
derivative
evidence
rule
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
doesn't
it
occur...
cover
quite
a
wide
number
of
cases?
this
was
a
case
where
the...
the
crime
that
the
police
were
after
were...
was
gun
possession.
it
might
be
narcotics
possession,
it
might
be
stolen
goods.
and
in
all
those
situations,
are
you
saying
that
the
constitutional
rule
is
that
a
police
chief
can
say
to
his
officers,
go
in
and
get
him
to
tell
you
where
the
narcotics
are,
where
the
gun
is,
where
the
stolen
goods
are?
we
don't
worry
about
his
statement,
but
we
want
the
goods.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
correct,
was
there
a
majority
to
take
that
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
main
rule
was,
the
police,
when
they
take
someone
into
custody,
are
supposed
to
give
them
four
warnings,
and
that
seems
to
me
a
simple,
clear
rule.
now
you...
you're
shifting
this
to
say,
well,
they
don't
have
to
give
the
warnings
up
front,
that's
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
certainly
is
reliable.
there's
no
question
that
it's
reliable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
that's...
i
think
that's
the
point
justice
kennedy
was
making...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
statement
might
not
be
reliable.
now,
there...
there
may
be
other
things
that
work
in
miranda,
not
just
to
make
sure
that
the
statement
is
reliable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
do...
we
do
have
a
number
of
things
that
are
permissive...
permissible,
like
a...
a
voice
exemplar...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
a
blood
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
were...
you
were
told
in
the
argument
by
mr.
dreeben
that
that
is
the
practice
of
the
fbi
and
the
federal
law
enforcement
officers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
was
there
never
a
question
in
this
case
of
whether
the...
there
was
consent
to
this
search,
because
the
defendant
said
twice,
i
know
my
rights?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
consent
to
the
questioning,
and
then
voluntarily
telling
them,
it's
on
a
shelf
in
my
bedroom?
why
wasn't
the...
the
whole
thing
pretty
much
like
when
you
go
to
the
bus
terminal
and
say,
mind
if
i
ask
you
a
question?
