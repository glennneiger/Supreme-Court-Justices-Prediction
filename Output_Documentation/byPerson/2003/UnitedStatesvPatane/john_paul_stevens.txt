justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
a...
a
modified
version
of
justice
scalia's
question?
supposing
that
the
government
used
official
powers,
such
as
a
grand
jury
subpoena
or
a
congressional
committee
subpoena,
to...
to
get
a
confession
out
of
a
person
under
threat
of
contempt
of
court,
so
it
was
clearly
just
a
fifth
amendment
was
a...
he
made
an
answer
that
revealed
the
existence
of
the
gun
and
then
he...
would
that
be
a...
would
the
gun
be
admissible
or
un...
inadmissible
in
that
scenario?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
you
mentioned
the
public
safety
exception.
we
wouldn't...
we
really
don't
need
a
public
safety
exception
if
you're
correct
in
this
case,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
core
ruling
of
the
public
safety
exception,
as
i
remember
it,
is
that
you
can
use
the
gun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
dreeben?
the...
there's
a
distinction
in...
in
your...
you
submit,
between
a
presumption
of
involuntariness
and
actual
involuntariness.
do
you
know
any
other
area
of
the
law
in
which
we've
differentiated
between
a
presumed
result
and
an
actual
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
understand...
you're...
you're...
there's...
there's
a
lot
in
the
case
that
support
what
you
say.
but
i'm
suggesting
it
is
kind
of
a
unique
development
of
the
law,
because
normally
i
would
think
if
you
presume
x
from
y,
that
would
be
the
same
as
proving
x.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
that's
new...
that's
not
true
in
this
line
of...
this
area
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
one
of
the
benefits
of...
under
the
miranda
analysis,
we
will...
we
avoid
the
necessity
of
resolving
difficult
issues
of
fact
sometimes.
there
are
a
lot
of
borderline
cases
to
whether
there
really
was
compulsion
or
it's
just
presumed.
we'll
have
to
get
back
into
that,
under
your
view.
justice
stevens
what...
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
background
question?
i
think
most
cases
you
know
whether
there
was
a
duty
to
give
the
miranda
warnings.
just
take
a
case
where
it's
clear
the
officer
failed
in
the...
in
the
duty
to
give
a
warning.
is
it
not
correct,
as
your
opponent
argued
in
the
first
sentence
of
his
oral
presentation,
that
the
law
has
generally
been
settled
for
a
long
time
that
fruits
are
nevertheless
admissible,
and
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you...
there
was
a
lot
of
interruptions
to
your
answer
to
my
question.
if
you
had
inadequate
time
to
say
everything
you
wanted
to
say
about
the
settled
state
of
the
law
before
this
case
arose
by...
in
the
lower
courts,
that's
your
opponent's
original
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
the
state
courts
were
uniform
in
the
same
way
the
federal
courts
were?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
that
on
both
the
matter
of
subsequent
confessions
and
physical
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
i
noticed
that
in
your
brief,
in
your
oral
statement
you
said
that
they
were
unanimous,
your
brief
said
there
was
a
strong
majority
in
the
federal
courts.
i
haven't
checked
it
out
myself
but
is
it...
is
it
a
unanimous
view
in
the
federal
courts?
