mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
miccosukee
tribe
and
friends
of
the
everglades
contend
that
a
pollutant
is
added
to
navigable
waters
whenever
it's
put
into
navigable
waters
where
it
would
not
otherwise
be,
whenever
it's
put
somewhere
where
it's
not
already
there
or
would
not
naturally
flow.
the
receiving
navigable
water
body
is
the
point
of
focus
under
the
clean
water
act
because
the
act
specifically
provides
for
designating
different
water
bodies
with
specific
designated
uses
and
with
associated
water
quality
standards
that
will
protect
those
uses.
and
the
associated
permitting
system
of
the
act
402
rests
on
the
assumption
that
the
proprietary
of
the...
proprietariness
of
the
proposed
addition
of
a
pollutant
will
be
measured
against
the
receiving
navigable
water
body's
designated
use
and
against
the
receiving
navigable
water
body's
water
quality
standards.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
yes.
justice
scalia,
it
says
any
addition
of
any
pollutant
to...
to
navigable
waters.
the
reason
navigable
waters
need
not
have
and
would
be
confusing
to
have
any
adjective
is
because
the
location
of
the
point
source
inherently
dictates
the
receiving
navigable
water.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
it
could,
your
honor,
but
since
the
permitting
system
is
from
a
point
source,
it
would
not
make
sense
to
say
to
any
other
navigable
water
that
the
point
source
is
not
discharging
to.
the
point
source
itself
makes
the
location
of
the
navigable
waters
specified
by
the
fact
that
the
point
source
can
only
discharge--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--yes,
justice
scalia,
but
if
that
were
the
meaning
of
that
text
and
the
lack
of
an
adjective,
any
navigable
waters
were
to
mean
that
once
in
navigable
waters,
that
pollutant
could
be
spread
to
any
navigable
water
with
any
different
designated
use
or
any
different
water
quality--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
this
provision
has
been
recognized
as
being
the
main
method
by
which
the
clean
water
act
cleans
up
water.
the...
the
problem
of
the
polluted
river
or
dirty
river
is
one
problem
with
the
interpretation
that
there's
a
singular
navigable
waters.
an
example...
a
specific
example
is
the
dubois
case,
in
which
the
pemigewassett
river
was,
in
fact,
so
bad
that
the
first
circuit
said
it
peeled
paint
off
of
the
adjoining
buildings
on
the
bank.
that
river,
under
this
interpretation,
would
have
been
put
into
loon
pond
strictly
for
the
purpose
of
resupplying
loon
pond.
it
didn't
always
go
through
snow-making
equipment.
the
first
circuit
made
it
clear
that
sometimes
it
is
directly
from
the
east
branch
to
loon
pond.
furthermore,
it
would
make
it
impossible
to
actually
administer
the
permitting
system
because
a
permit
writer
is
told
to
evaluate
the
propriety
of
the
proposed
addition
of
a
pollutant
based
on
the
designated
use
and
the
water
quality
standards
of
the
receiving
navigable
water.
it
wouldn't
be
effective
if
thereafter
that
permit
were
deemed,
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
have
authorized
the
addition
of
that
pollutant
throughout
the
entire
united
states
to
any
navigable
water
no
matter
what
its
designated
use
and
no
matter
what
its
water
quality
standard.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
yes,
the
united
states,
justice
breyer,
on
many
occasions...
starting
in
1975
epa
general
counsel
issued
the
opinion
that
surface
water
runoff
and
return
flows
from
irrigation,
even
when
in
navigable
waters,
that
is
to
say
an
agricultural
canal,
when
then
discharged
to
other
navigable
waters,
would
require
a
permit.
congress
did
not
repudiate
that
because
what...
congress,
if
it
had
repudiated
it,
would
have
said
that
was
not
an
addition.
in
fact,
congress--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--but
the
question--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--well,
those
elements
of
it
are,
justice
scalia,
but
what
the
epa
opinion--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--well,
it
is
not
different
when
it
gets
into
the
canal.
the
c-11
canal,
which
is
a
drainage
canal
that
receives
surface
water
runoff,
like
an...
a
agricultural
canal
that
receives
irrigation
return
flow,
is
itself
a
jurisdictional
navigable
waters
under
this
court's
decisions
in
riverside
bayview
simply
because
it's
connected
to,
in
this
case,
the
atlantic.
in
other
words,
it's
not
navigable
in
fact
itself.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
yes.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
yes.
well,
it
is
inaccurate
in
the
sense
that
in
1993
epa
told
the
south
florida
water
management
district,
to
its
chagrin,
that
it
would
have
to
have
npdes
permits
for
all
of
these
everglades
construction
project
features
that
were
motivated
by
the
united
states
v.
south
florida
water--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
well,
in
most
cases--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--in
most
cases,
your
honor,
the
simple
movement
of
water
does
not
end
up,
even
under
miccosukee...
this
case,
requiring
a
permit.
most
of
them
are...
are
not
covered.
they
return
to
the
same
water
body.
the
dam
cases
make
it
clear
that
that's
a
return
to
the
same
water
body.
if
they're--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--we
distinguish
them,
your
honor,
because
the
dam
cases
dealt
with
the
condition...
the
d.c.
circuit
made
it
clear
in
the
gorsuch
case
in
'82
that
dam-induced
changes
in
condition
such
as
super-saturation
and
so
forth,
and
that
that
was
not
a
pollutant.
they
didn't
say
dams
weren't
point
sources.
they
said
that
was
not
a
pollutant.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
no,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--neither
side
takes
the
position,
but
it
is
true
that
the
phrase,
water
body,
because
it's
used
in
so
much
of
the
epa
regulations,
is
a
shorthand
for
saying
that
the
pollutant
is
added
to
a
navigable
water
that
wouldn't
otherwise
receive
it.
the
fact
is
that
as
the
first
circuit
said,
the
argument
about
whether
loon
pond,
well
up
here...
uphill
from
the
pemigewassett
river,
east
branch,
was
hydrologically
connected
or
not
was
irrelevant
because
loon
pond
would
never
receive
water
from
the
pemigewassett
river,
even
though
that
loon
pond
eventually
flowed
through
the
watershed
to
the
river.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
well,
your
honor,
first
with
respect
to
the
same
body
of
water,
if
you
were
referring
to
the
everglades,
this
is
a...
c-11
is
a
canal
that
has
gas
stations,
urban
shopping
malls,
industrial
parks
around
it.
and
the
canal
itself
was
dug
out.
it's
not
as
though
99.99
percent
of
the
everglades
were
removed.
so
that
canal
has
been
dug
deeper.
the
everglades'
ecosystem
removed.
it's
distinctly
different.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
well,
with
respect
to
these
larger
water
projects,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
if
they're
withdrawing
water,
they're
not
going
to
come
under
our
condition,
withdrawing
and
then
being
used
for
a
consumptive
use
and
so
forth.
that's
already
dealt
with
a
different
way.
if
they're
returning
the
water
through
irrigation
return
flow,
that's
already
exempt.
otherwise,
if
they're...
the
state
does
designate
the
use
and
does
designate
the
water
quality
standards.
so
these
large
movements
through
canals
and
water
projects...
the
state
controls
the
designation
of
those
uses.
and
even
if
they
were
found
to
be
a
movement
from
one
navigable
water
to
another,
they're
likely
to
qualify
for
a
general
permit.
as
colorado
said
on
page
3
of
its
brief,
none
of
their
movements
of
water,
through
any
structures
in
colorado,
interbasin
transfers,
result
in
a
water
quality
standard
violation.
accordingly,
colorado
solves
any
problem
it
has
with
one
general
permit.
as
well,
most
of
these
big
movements
of
water
move
water
that
doesn't
distinctly,
as
in
this
case,
move
water
that's
four
times
higher
in
a
certain
content
than
the
receiving
water
body's
water
quality
standard.
the
state
law
for
the
everglades
and
only
the
everglades
protection
area,
not
the
c-11
canal,
is
now
10
parts
per
billion.
that
actual
number
was
changed
and
became
effective
january
1
of
2004,
but
it
had
a
separate
designation
and
water
quality
standard
throughout
all
of
the
time
of
this
case.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
yes,
justice
stevens.
with
respect
to
the
first,
they're
distinctly
different
bodies
of
water.
the
c-11
canal
is
a
canal
that
has
been
dug
artificially
deep,
surrounded
by
gas
stations,
shopping
malls.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
and
it
does
not
have
the
ecology
of
the
everglades.
nobody
stands
at
a
gas
station
and
says
to
their
child,
there,
john,
is
the
everglades.
it...
it
has...
and
it
doesn't
have
everglades
water
because
everglades
water
would
naturally
flow
west
to
east,
and
they
have
blocked
that
flow
from
the
everglades
into
the
sloughs
and
into
the
atlantic
ocean.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
with
respect
to
the
second,
the
record
shows
the
trial
court
found
that
substantial
surface
water
runoff
goes
into
the
c-11,
and--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--well,
the
source
of
the
runoff
is
sometimes
rainfall.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
and
it
is
sometimes
from
the
aquifer--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--and
it
is
sometimes
from
the
aquifer
below
the
c-11
because
the
c-11
basin,
as
opposed
to
the
canal...
the
c-11
basin
is
a...
has
been
drained
and
substantial
fill
put
in
for
the
gas--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--your
honor--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--yes,
your
honor,
from
west
to
east,
but
not
east
to
west,
and
when
the
water
transfers
through
the--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--well,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
waters
will
flow
from
the...
in
that
case,
there
would
be
perhaps
three
bodies
of
water
in
the
united
states:
east
of
the
appalachian
divide,
west
of
it,
and...
and
then
separated
by
the
continental
divide
in
the
west.
the
fact
that
one
water
will
flow
eventually
into
the
other
doesn't
make
them
the
same
water
body.
that
is
to
say,
loon
pond,
which
was
a
substantially
different
ecology
and
water
quality
standard
and
different
classification
by
the
state,
flowing
eventually
into
the
polluted
pemigewassett
river
much
further
downstream,
did
not
make
them
the
same
water
body.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
that's
correct.
in
this
case
subsurface
flow...
that
water
is
substantially
changed
in
the
aquifer.
by
the
time
it's
underneath
the
c-11,
it
doesn't
have
the
biological
or
ecosystem
characteristics
of
the
water
that
is
in
the
everglades
protection
area.
it's
been
substantially
changed
by
the...
by
the
aquifer.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
we
do
argue
that
it
is
the
same
water
body
and
you
pump
it
substantially
upstream.
you
would
also
need
a
permit.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
the
downstream
pemigewassett
river--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--well,
there
is
a...
there
is
a--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--there
is...
there
is
epa
guidance,
but
the
fact
that
303
of
the
act
itself
mandates
that
states
designate
different
water
bodies
and
the
phrase,
water
bodies,
used
in
the
epa
specification
of
what
water
quality
standards
is
means
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
done
all
of
the
time.
and
in
the
state
of
florida,
the
state
legislature
has
designated
the
everglades
protection
area
quite
distinct
from
the
canal,
a
different
water
quality
standard
and
a...
and
a
different
use
for
that
water.
and
as
a
hydrological
matter,
they
are...
they
are
able
to...
to
deal
with
that.
they've
given
them
different
water
body
numbers
in
the
state
of
florida.
the
c-11
canal
is
a
different
water
body
number
from
the
everglades...
various
parts
of
the
everglades
protection
area
and...
and
so
forth.
the--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--this
permit
would
most
likely
require
simply
that
the
plan
that
the
district
already
has...
has
on
the
books
and
which
they
mentioned
in
their
brief
would
be
implemented
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
under
a
reasonable
compliance
schedule.
the
everglades
restoration
project
was
first
motivated,
as...
as
is
admitted
in
all
briefs,
by
litigation
against
the
district
for
discharging
phosphorus
that
caused
an
imbalance
of
natural
populations
of
flora
and
fauna,
and
furthermore,
all
of
the
congressional
acts
that
deal
with
the
everglades
restoration
projects...
that's...
and
they're
referred
to
in
our
brief
called
wrda,
water
resources
development
act
'96
and
water
resources
development
act
2000...
both
refer
to
the
pending
litigation
and
make
the
statement
that
they
don't
intend
to
interfere
with
pending
litigation.
and
wrda
2000
specifically
says
that
nothing
in
these
everglades
restoration...
this
section
shall
be
deemed
to
eliminate
any
permitting
requirements
under
law.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
yes.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
well,
your
honor--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--we...
we
believe,
as...
as
congress
did,
that
the
clean
water
act...
that
the
programs
in
place
were
not
always
implemented
and
that
the
clean
water
act
was
necessary
as
a
backstop
to
stop
the
backsliding.
the
federal
government's
litigation
in
1988
required
the
state
to
do
no
more
than
the
state
in
press
releases
was
saying
that
it
was
doing
and
intended
to
do,
but
the
litigation,
reinforced
by
congress
that
specifically
said
we
don't
intend
to
interfere
with
any
of
that
litigation,
indicates
why
federal
enforcement
is
a...
is
a
useful
and
necessary
tool
to
ensure
that
states
under
different
pressures
don't
backslide.
our
brief
appendix
indicates
that
2
years
ago
they
indicated
they
would
meet
water
quality
standards
in
the
s-9
by
2005,
and
then
with
the
pendency
of
this
litigation,
they
have
eliminated
any
commitment
to
reach
it
by
2005,
hoping
that
this
litigation
will
first
relieve
them
of
the
oversight
of
the
npdes
on
s-9
and
then
they
will
use
this
litigation
to
eliminate
the
npdes's
that
were
required
from
1993
forward
on
the
other
projects.
the
only
thing
that
keeps
those...
those
other
discharge
structures
under
the
restoration
project
from
not
being
extended
or
otherwise
modified
by
the
state
are
the
epa
placed
npdes
permits
that
already
exist
on
all
of
those
everglades
restoration
projects.
we
simply
want
the
same
permitting
backstop
on
the
s-9
structure.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
singular
waters,
the
singular
waters
approach
of
the
united
states
eliminates
the
different
designated
uses
and
the
ability
to
actually
determine
the
effects
of
a
permit.
the
minnesota
amici
brief
is
very
useful
in
this
sense
because
it
points
out
that
st.
paul
now,
like
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
and
others,
does
get
an
npdes
to
remove
water
from
the
mississippi
to
its
lake
and
water
reservoir.
however,
if
the
solicitor
general's
position
were
correct,
st.
paul
would
no
longer
need
that
npdes
permit,
and
st.
cloud,
substantially
up-river
on
the
mississippi,
would...
would
be
under
a...
a
review
for
does
its
discharges
to
the
mississippi,
which
have
been
found
to
meet
the
npdes
requirements,
not
changing
the
designated
use
or
violating
the
mississippi's
water
quality
standard...
it...
its
discharges
should
be
deemed
to
be
somehow
removable
artificially
downstream
in
the
mississippi
so
that
anyplace
anyone
at
any
time
might
construct
the
pipe
and
move
them
into
a
more
pristine
water
body,
you,
st.
cloud
now
have
to
anticipate
that
and
will
be
put
under
that...
that
mandate.
so
the
inability
of
a
permit
writer
to
construct

--well,
in
the
so-called
worst
case,
justice
scalia,
they'd
be
qualifying

they
don't
have
a...
they're
not
impairing

qualifying
for
one
general
permit
issued
in
the
state.
but
under
other
circumstances--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--yes,
your
honor.
general
permits
are
authorized
and
they
are
often
written
to
say
under
the
following
conditions,
you
qualify
for
the
general
permit,
and...
and--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
you
don't
have
to
get
it.
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
the
general
permit
might
or
might
not
say
to
do
certain
monitoring
to
make
sure
that
you
stay
within
the
conditions
of
the
general
permit.
those
general
permits
are
very
common,
and
even
individual
permits
are
usually
system-wide
permits.
you
have
80
structures--
mr.
dexter
w.
lehtinen
--yes,
your
honor.
a
general
permit
can
be
statewide.
the
permit
looks
almost
like
a
rule,
but
the
permit
says...
and
in
the
case
of
the
corps,
they
do
nationwide
permits,
but
404
is
not
at
issue
here.
the
general
permit
statewide
could
say
that
under
the
following
circumstances,
when
you
are
an
unimpaired
water
body
discharging
to
an
unimpaired
water
body
or
discharging
at
levels
that
have
pollutants
but
don't
impair
the
receiving
water
body,
you
automatically
qualify
for
this
permit.
do
some
monitoring.
let
us
know
every
year.
that
general
permit
is...
is
frequently
used
and...
and
is
very
close
to
rulemaking.
but
it's
also
possible,
under
those
circumstances...
and
this
is
not
our
case.
our
case
discharges
at
almost
four
times
the
water
quality
standard,
10
parts
per
billion,
for
the
receiving
water
body.
it
clearly
impairs
the
receiving
water
body.
but
if
the
standard
for
a
water
body
were
20
of
a
substance,
its
actual
receiving
level
was
10
and
you
discharged
at
5,
not
to
get
too
complex,
but
you're
discharging
at
a
lower
level
than
the
receiving
water
body
and
the
water
bodies
are
not
impaired,
it's
possible
mathematically,
but
not
our
case
here...
these
hypotheticals
should
be
left
to
another
time.
it's
possible
that
the
1
gallon
in
the
receiving
water
body
that
had
10,
with
1
gallon
added
to
it
that
had
5,
the
2
gallons
now
have
15,
or
in
fact,
7-and-a-half
per
receiving
unit.
that
may
be
determined
by
rule
or
other
appropriate
analysis
in
the
western
cases,
if
they
ever
come
up,
to
not
be
an
addition.
but
that's
not
our
case
here.
the
court,
in
an
abundance
of
caution,
could
point
out
that
our
case
here
is
an
artificial
canal
that
receives
substantial
surface
water
runoff,
itself
probably
a
conveyance
under
the
clean
water
act
definition
of
channels
or
discrete
conveyances,
that
it
discharges
at
levels
up
to
four
times
the
receiving
water
body's
water
quality
standard,
that
it
is
itself
an
impaired
water
body.
so
that
the
hypothetical
situations
or
application
to
western
states
or
elsewhere
is...
are
not
being
addressed
by
the
court.
now...
now,
the...
the
amici
from
the
tongue
and
yellowstone
river
irrigation
district
point
out
actually
that
in
the
west,
they
believe
that
ranchers
and
farmers
will
suffer
from
the
federal
government's
unitary
water
theory
because
they
will
now
be
subject
to
water
that
is
not
of
sufficient
quality
for
their
irrigation
district
and
so
forth.
it's
not
simply
a
west...
and
the
state
of
washington
also
joined
in
our
brief.
we,
of
course...
we
don't
count
states,
but
more
states
support
the
tribe
in
their
briefs
saying
this
is
essential
than
do
support
the...
the
district
and
the
united
states.
the...
it's
particularly
important
to
recognize
the
c-11
was
itself
dug,
is
not
a
residual
part
of
the
everglades,
and
that
it's...
the
c-11
basin
is
not
simply
a...
a
water
body
divided
from
the
wca
or
the
everglades
protection
area
by
a
levee.
looking
at
pages
6a
and
7a
of
our
brief,
which
are
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
are
from
the
district's
own
web
site,
which
it
cited
in
its
brief,
and
it
shows
the
urban
construction
right
to
the
boundary.
so
it's
not
that
the
c-11
basin
is
water
just
divided.
it's
an
artificial
canal.
it's
no...
no
more
part
of
the
everglades
protection
area
than
fenway
park
in
boston
is
part
of
the
charles
river
because
it's
built
on
the
landfill
where
the
charles
river
once
was.
they're
quite
distinct.
with
respect
to
federalism
issues,
the
clean
water
act
itself
is
a
federalism
instrument
because
it
provides
for
the
states
to
do
the
designation
of
uses.
it
provides
for
the
states
to...
to
create
the
water
quality
standards,
and
it
does
protect
the
ability
of
the
states
to
allocate
quantities
of
water,
but
this
is
not
a
quantity
allocation.
the
record
shows
clearly
that
the
s-9
pump
is
turned
on
when
you
get
to
1
foot
of...
turned
off
when...
when
the
c-11
basin
is
at
1
foot
and
turned
on
when
it's
at
4
foot.
it
is
strictly
a
drainage
mechanism
to
take
surface
water
runoff
and
other
water
out
of
the
c-11.
they're
disposing
of
water.
they
don't
want
the
water.
they're
dumping
the
water
wherever
they
can
put
it.
and
actually
the
water
is
not
our
concern.
it
is
the
pollutants.
whenever
they
say
merely
conveying
water,
we
would
say
conveyance
is
defined
as
a
point
source
and
they
convey
pollutants.
if
they
didn't
convey
this
massive
amount
of
pollutants,
we
would
not
be
before
your
honors.
the
district,
by
pumping
pollutants
contained
in
the
water
against
the
natural
flow
of
that
water
into
the
specially
designated
everglades
protection
area,
added
that
water
to
the
everglades
protection
area
within
the
plain
meaning
of...
of
the
clean
water
act
and
within
the
common
usage
of...
of
language.
the
district
put
those
pollutants
in
the
everglades
and
nobody
but
the
district
put
those
pollutants
in
the
everglades.
an
effort
to
reconstruct
the
term,
addition
to
navigable
waters,
to
allow
them
to
dispose
of
those
pollutants
anywhere
in
the
united
states
with
a
navigable
water
of
any
designated
use
or
of
any
water
quality
standard
would
decimate
the
clean
water
act's
protection
not
only
of
the
everglades,
but
of
the
case
law
that...
that
your
honors
have
had
cited
in
the
brief.
now,
the
circuit
court
cases
are
not
particularly
precedent
for
your
court,
but
it
does
point
out
that
loon
pond
would
have
had
water
that
peeled
paint
off
of
the
adjoining
buildings
put
into
it
and
not
just
through
snow-making
devices.
the...
the
court
clearly
indicated
that
sometimes
the
pemigewassett
water
was
put
directly
to
loon
pond
to...
to
increase
the
amount
of
water
in
loon
pond.
now,
the...
the
united
states
would
try
to
save
its
singular
water
theory
in
some
cases
by
saying,
well,
water
might
be
removed.
they
said
on
the
dubois
case,
the
first
circuit
loon
pond,
that
it
was
removed
for
snow-making,
but
i
point
out
that
the
court
said
in
several
places
that
it
also
went
directly,
never
through
snow-making
devices.
they
would
say
that
when
you
put
it
through
tunnels
or
so
forth,
perhaps
it
loses
its
navigable
water
character.
the
state
of
new
york,
of
course,
is
strongly
in
favor
of
the
tribe
because
the
18-mile
shandaken
tunnel

them
