mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
not
sure
the
record
is
clear
on
this,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm...
i
cannot
give
you
assurance.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
submits
that
the
clean
water
act
does
not
require
the
south
florida
water
management
district
to
obtain
a
section
402
permit
for
the
operation
of
water
control
facilities
like
the
s-9
pump
which
simply
move
water
from
one
location
to
another.
we
believe
that
position
is
correct
on
the
basis
of
both
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
overarching
purposes
of
the
statute
and
its
structure,
and
also
epa's
actual
practices.
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
section
402
states
that
a
npdes
permit
is
required
when
there
is
an
addition
of
a
pollutant
to
navigable
waters
from
a
point
source,
and
section
5027
goes
on
to
state
that
a...
the
waters...
the
navigable
waters
are
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
under
that
definition
and
those
statutory
provisions,
when
an
industrial
out-fall
introduces
pollutants
for
the
first
time
into
the
waters
of
the
united
states,
an
npdes
permit
is
required.
however,
when
a
water
control
facility
like
the
s-9
pump
simply
moves
water
from
one
place
to
another,
together
with
any
pollutants
that
might
be
contained
therein,
that
regulatory
regime
is
not
called
into
play.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
the...
the
text
precludes
that
understanding
because
it
states
any
addition
of
any
pollutant.
and
we
think
the
use...
these
definitions
are
written
quite
carefully,
and
we
think
that
those...
the
term
any--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--indicates
you
can't
rule
it
out.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is...
that's
not
the
case
that
epa
has
used
a
single
body
of
water.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
i
think
that
in
fact
the...
the
approach
that
epa
has
taken
in
this
is...
can
be
seen
from
a
number
of
sources.
first
of
all,
epa
has
never
attempted
to
regulate
water
control
facilities
like
the
s-9
pump
in
the
30
years
that
the
npdes
program
has
been
in
place.
and
what's
more,
in
cases,
the
closely
analogous
cases,
of
dams
where
water
is
simply
being
passed
through
a
dam,
epa
has
taken
the
position
that
an
npdes
permit
is
not
required.
part
of
the
reason
for
this
is
there
are
other
regulatory
programs
that
deal
with
these
problems.
justice
breyer
mentioned
the
problem
of
taking
a
polluted
river
and
combining
it
with
a
pristine
river.
that
actually
implicates
a
number
of
different
programs.
first
of
all,
in
the
case
of
the
polluted
river,
that
river
is
subject
to
402
requirements,
and
so
there
will
be
steps
taken
to
prevent
the
discharge
of
pollutants
into
the
polluted
river.
the
states
also
are
required,
or
at
least
strongly
urged
by
the
government
and
with
strong
carrot
and
stick
type
incentives,
to
adopt
non-point
source
pollution
programs
to
reduce
any
non-point
pollution
that
might
be
going
into
that
polluted
river.
if
there's
an
attempt
to
connect
that
river
to
another
river,
it
does
implicate,
as
mr.
bishop
indicated,
the
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
which
deals
with
regulations
that
result
in
the
change
in
the
flow
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--c-11,
when
it
was
first
constructed
at
that...
at
the
time
that
the
c-11
canal
was
built
back
in
the
1950's,
most
likely...
well,
it
was
in
fact
constructed
by
the
corps
of
engineers.
so
it
was
subject
to
the
public
interest
review
provisions
that
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
envisions.
when
the...
the
corps
investigates
private
connections
of
this
type,
it
conducts
what's
called
a
public
interest
review,
and
this
is
described
in
your
case,
united
states
v.
alaska
at
503
u.s.
569.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--epa
has
substantial
discretion
to
minimize
the
types
of
regulatory
burdens
that
might
be
imposed
here.
nevertheless,
they're
likely
to
be
substantial.
and
what
they
amount
to
in
this
case
is
really
a
belt
and
suspenders
approach,
and
you
know,
the
additional
haberdashery
is
fine
except
for
the
cost
that
it
does
entail.
in
this
case
it
could
be
very
substantial
for
projects
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that's
correct.
and
in
addition,
i
think
we
have
to
consider
what
would
a
permit
accomplish
in
this
case
that
the
cerp
project
that
the
corps
of
engineers
has...
is
implementing
is
not
already
doing.
that
project
is
designed
to
deal
with
these
problems.
the
permitting
program
is
really
designed
to
deal
with
the
specific
problem
of
introducing
pollutants
into
waterways
for
the
first
time.
it's
really
not
capable
of
dealing
with
this
problem
of
water
transfers
that
move
from
one
place
to
another.
rather,
there
are
other
programs
that
deal
with
this.
if
it's
a
federal
program,
it
would
be
subject
to
nepa,
for
instance,
and
there
would
be
an
environmental
analysis
before
any
action
was
taken.
in
the
case
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
that
i
described
before,
that
would
also
implicate
section
401
of
the
clean
water
act,
which
requires
a
water
quality
certification,
a
determination
from
the
state
that
in
fact
waters
would
be...
would
not
violate
water
quality
standards.
i'd
like
to
make
the
point
also
that
our
position
is
not
an
extreme
one
in
saying
that
the...
the
text
requires
that
we
only
look
at
the
pollution
when
it
first
enters
the
water.
rather,
it's
a...
it's
a
approach
that
recognizes
that
cleaning
up
polluted
water
requires
a
number
of
different
control
strategies.
the
npdes
permitting
program
is
only
one.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
state
of...
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
can,
of
course,
adopt
that
type
of
program
on
its
own
under
its
state
law
to
deal
with
those
types
of
programs.
any
state
can.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
might
very
well
be,
and
it
is
allowed
to
supplement
the
federal
scheme
with
its
own
state
additions.
but
other
states,
such
as
california,
have
found--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
these...
the...
epa
has
delegated
authority
to
implement
the
permitting
program
to
a
number
of
states,
including
pennsylvania.
so
pennsylvania
is
issuing
the
402
permits
in
lieu
of
the
federal
government.
my
point
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
true.
in
fact,
it
has
in
most
states.
so
in
fact,
in
most
states
the
states
are
issuing
these
permits
with
substantial
guidance
from
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
is
setting
the
floor
for
what
the
permit
requirements
are,
but
the
states
are
free
to
supplement
their
permitting
programs
with
additional
state
requirements
and
many
do
so.
many
states
like
california
actually
operate
with
additional
programs
apart
from
the
clean
water
act.
i
think
that
judge
kennedy
when
he
was...
or
justice
kennedy...
excuse
me...
when
he
was
a
judge
on
the
ninth
circuit,
wrote
an
opinion
concerning
the
new
malones
project
where
he
talked
about
the
imposition
of
water
quality
standards
at...
at
the
state
level
on
federal
projects
and
indicated
that
the
states,
in
fact,
do
have
that
authority
as
well.
my...
my
point
here
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
different
mechanisms
here
in
which
these
problems
can
be
addressed,
and
the
important
point
is
to
choose
the
right
one.
in
this
context,
the
npdes
permitting
program
is
not
the
correct
mechanism
for
dealing
with
the
problems
that
the
florida
everglades
faces.
instead,
that
problem
is
being
addressed
comprehensively
through
federal
and
state
programs.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
the
view.
the
brief
of
the
united
states
here
is
it
reflects
a
consensus
of
a
number
of
agencies,
not
only
epa
but
the
department
of
the
interior,
the
corps
of
engineers,
and
the
department
of
army.
and
i'd
like
to
mention
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
this
court
should
draw
inferences
from
the
names
that
are
on
the
cover
of
the
brief,
and
those
inferences
should
not
be
drawn.
the
names
on
the
brief
have
no
relationship
to
whether
or
not...
the
absence
of
the
names
of
an
agency
does
not
indicate
the
brief
does...
does
not
represent
the
views
of
a
particular
agency.
that
can
be
seen
in
a
number
of
briefs,
including
the
swank
brief
from
two
terms
ago
in
which
administrator
browner
was
a
party
in
that
case,
a
party
to
the
proceeding,
and
yet
there
are
no
epa
counsel
names
on
the
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they're
relying
on
a
1975
general
counsel
opinion
that
addressed
the
question
of
irrigation
return
flows.
congress
repudiated
the
position
that
was
taken
there
2
years
later
in
the
1977
amendments.
it
mentions
this
point
only
tangentially.
it's
not
even
among
the
17
questions
presented
that
are
listed
in
that
opinion.
and
i
think
what's
more
telling
is
the
practice
of
epa
since
that
time.
epa
has
not
required
permits
from
water
control
facilities
to
do
no
more
than
move
water.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
endorse
that
addition.
thank
you,
your
honor.
