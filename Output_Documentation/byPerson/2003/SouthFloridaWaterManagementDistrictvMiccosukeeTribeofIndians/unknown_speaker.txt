unknown
speaker
the
obvious
question
on
your
thing
is
you
have
one
of
these
rivers
that's
so
filthy
that
you
can
set
fire
to
it,
and
next
to
it
is
the
most
pristine,
beautiful
trout
lake
ever.
and
so
what
we
build
is
a
little
pipe
and
the
pipe
takes
these
filthy,
absolutely
disgusting
water
and
pours
it
into
this
beautiful,
pristine
trout
pond.
all
right?
now,
you're
saying
that
that
doesn't
fall
within
the
statute,
and--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean
it
doesn't
require
a
permit.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
epa,
it
wouldn't.
and...
and,
of
course,
the
obvious
thing
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
epa
through
the
permit.
through
the
permit.
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
protect--
unknown
speaker
--i...
i
suppose
it's
beyond
the
purview
of
this
case.
do
we
know
whether
or
not
the
transfer
of
waters
in
this
case
would
violate
those
other
regulations?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bishop,
the
eleventh
circuit
said
that
moving
water
within
a
single,
distinct
body
of
water
could
never
result
in
the
addition
of
pollutants
to
that
body
of
water.
now,
i
assume
you
agree
with
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
so
in...
in
justice
breyer's
example,
if
the
pristine
trout
pond
is
waters
of
the
united
states,
then
there
would
not
be
an
addition
of
the
pollutant
to
waters
of
the
united
states
when
the
filthy
river
was
pumped
into
the
pond.
unknown
speaker
no.
i...
maybe
it
would
violate
the
standards,
but
i'm...
i'm
just
talking
about
the
provision
required
here.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
it
would
not
do
so
because
it
would
not
be
the
addition
of
a
pollutant
to
waters
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
assuming
the
river
is
navigable,
the
filthy
river.
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i'm
driving
at
here
is...
is
the
following.
you
have
ambiguous
language.
i
think
it's
a
very
difficult
question.
if
i
accept
your
side
of
it,
it
seems
to
me
i
live...
leave
the
epa
without
any
power
to
deal
with
what
i
just
called
the
filthy
river
problem,
or
at
least
not
the...
i'm
not
trying
to
be
tricky
in
my
words.
i...
i
understand
they
have
other
authority
and
so
forth.
but
there
is
a
filthy
river
problem
if
i
take
your
side
of
it.
and
if
i
take
their...
if
i
take
your
side
of
it,
that
is
some
kind
of
a
problem.
you
can
explain
to
me
in
1
second
why
it's
no
problem
whatsoever.
i'd
like
to
hear
that.
i
want
to
say
the
opposite
thing.
your
problem
that
you
raise,
if
i
take
their
side,
is
suddenly
everybody
in
the
california
water
project,
which
is
huge,
central
valley
irrigation,
has
to
run
off
and
get
permits,
and
that
too
is
a
big
problem.
so
it
sounds
to
me
that
that
second
problem
could
be
dealt
with
by
epa
through
rules
that
would,
in
effect,
not
make
them
come
in
because
they'd
automatically
get
permits
in
certain
circumstances.
but
if
i
take
your
side
of
it,
the
opposite
filthy
river
problem,
there's
nothing
to
be
done.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
what
i
say
moves
me
at
the
second
for
hypothetical
purposes
towards
their
side,
but
i'm
asking
you
to
move
me
back.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bishop,
can
we
see...
take
this
concrete
case?
i
mean,
this
is
a
case
about
phosphorus
being
dumped
into
a
relatively
unpolluted
body
of
water.
what
is
the
state
of
florida
or
anybody
doing
to
reduce
the
level
of
phosphorus
that
comes
from
this
pump
and
gets
dumped
into
the
pure
water?
unknown
speaker
yes.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right...
i
know
some
seeps
through,
but
what
is
the
principal
source
of
the
water
in
the
c-11
basin?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that's
the
principal
source?
it
seeps
in.
you're
just
pumping
it
back
into
the
everglades?
unknown
speaker
but
where
does
the
water
that
the
people
in
the
western
part
of
broward
county
use
to
water
their
lawns
and
bathe
and
so...
where
does
that
water
come
from?
unknown
speaker
there's
an
aquifer
to
the
east
of
the...
of
the
levees?
unknown
speaker
are
you
telling
me
there's
an
aquifer
to
the
east
of
the
levee?
unknown
speaker
which
is
a
separate
source
of
water
than
the
source
that
feeds
the
large...
the
wca-3--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
seepage
can't--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
seepage
can't
contain
any
of
the
pollution--
unknown
speaker
--because
the
water
on
the
west
side
of
the
levee
is...
is
clean.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
certainly
cleaner
than
the
water
on
the
east
side
or
you
wouldn't
have
a
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
but
the
water...
the
seepage
clearly
is
not
what
causes
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
which...
which
means--
unknown
speaker
--which
means
that
the
water
to
the
east
will
be
even
more
polluted
and
when
you
pump
that
back
in,
you'll
be
pumping
more
polluted
water
back
in.
unknown
speaker
this
is
all
very
important,
but
on
the
legal
question
that
we
have,
do
you
take
the
position
that
it's
a
single
body
of
water--
unknown
speaker
--and
therefore
no
permit
is
required?
unknown
speaker
that's
an
extreme
position,
and
you
probably
have
a
fall-back
position.
unknown
speaker
you...
you
go--
unknown
speaker
--what...
what's
the
fall-back?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
been
altered
by
manmade
structures
so
that
they
perhaps
are
no
longer
a
single
body.
is
that
what
the
eleventh
circuit
concluded
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
that
the
manmade
structures
have
separated
them
and
they're
no
longer
unitary.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
describe
that
aquifer?
unknown
speaker
while
you're
looking
for
that,
i...
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
you
can
interpret...
i
can
understand
how
you
can
interpret
the
phrase,
navigable
waters,
to
mean
all
navigable
waters.
i
can't
understand
how
you
can
interpret
the
phrase,
navigable
waters,
to
mean
only
those
navigable
waters
that
are
within
a
single
aquifer
or
within
a
single
drainage
district.
how...
how
can
you
possibly
derive
that
interpretation
from
the
text?
unknown
speaker
which
is...
which
is
why
you
took
the
extreme
position,
that
is
really
textually
not
very
extreme
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bishop,
as
i--
unknown
speaker
--as
i
understand,
that
was
the
government's
brief
and
it
was
spelled
out
very
clearly.
i
didn't
understand
your
brief
to
be
taking
the
position
that
all
we
have
to
worry
about
is
the
term,
navigable
water,
then
that's
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bishop,
isn't
the
problem
with
the
unitary
concept
idea
that
given
the
purposes
of
the
clean
water
act,
it
makes
great
sense
if
there
is
a
way
of
distinguishing
between
bodies
of
water
to
distinguish
them
in
terms
of
their...
their
pollution?
and
the...
in...
in
effect,
the...
the
function
of
the
kind
of
unitary
definition
is
a
function
that...
that
works
against
the
protection
of
clean
water
as
against
to
dirty
water
that
can
be
added
to
it.
and...
and
shouldn't
the...
shouldn't
the
purposes
of
the
act
be
taken
into
consideration
in
defining
what
is
a
body
or
a
unified
body
of
water?
unknown
speaker
are...
are
you
talking
about
a...
a
distinction
based
on
the...
the
quality
of
the
water
as
polluted
or
clean
or
relatively
polluted/relatively
clean?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying...
you're
saying
that
the
problem
that
i'm
raising
is
a
problem
that
is
dealt
with
solely
by
water
quality
standards
and
cannot
be
dealt
with
by...
by
point
source
emission
regulation.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
assuming
a
state
may
do
that,
why
does
it
follow
that
in
defining
bodies
of
water
for
point
source
purposes,
we
may
not
do
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
answer
my
question
before
you
run
through
because
i...
i
tend
to
lose
the
answers
in
the...
in
the
run-throughs.
you're...
you're
saying,
look,
when
we're
talking
about
water
quality
standards,
there
are
distinctions
made
within
a
given
body
of
water
or
within
navigable
water.
and
i
think
you're
saying
that
for
a
point
source
emission
issues,
we
don't
make
that
kind
of
distinction.
my
question
was,
if
the
distinction
can
be
made
and
in
fact
is
made,
with
respect
to
water
quality
standards,
why
should
it
follow
that
the
same
distinction
cannot
be
made
for
purposes
of
definition
in
point
source
problems?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understood
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
didn't
say
it
cannot
be
made.
you
said
it
has
not
been
made--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
has
not
been
made
and
you're
saying
it
would
be
illegitimate
to
make
it
as
a
matter
of
interpretation.
and
my
question
is,
why
would
it
be
illegitimate
as
a
matter
of
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
then
what
did...
what
did
the
tribe
mean
when
it
said
that
there
are,
i
think...
major
components
of
the
everglades
construction
project
are
already
under
npdes
programs?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
bishop.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
minear,
before
you
start,
if
i
may
just...
could
you
tell
me
if
you
think
the
record
explains
where
the
water
in
the
eastern...
east
of
the
c-11
basin
originates?
unknown
speaker
because
the
part
that
mr.
bishop
brought
my
attention
to
does
not
answer
the
question.
unknown
speaker
you
don't...
you
don't
know
the
answer.
unknown
speaker
but
if
in
fact
an
industrialist
adds
quite...
something
quite
filthy
out
of
a
pipe
into
a
clean
body
of
water,
there
is
no
addition
if,
at
the
same
time,
in
some
other
body
of
water,
he's
taking
out
an
equivalent
amount.
unknown
speaker
so
a
single
body
of
water
is--
unknown
speaker
--a
single
body
of
water,
which
seems
to
have
been
a
concept
that
the
epa
has
used
for
years
and
years...
that's
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
they
haven't.
they've
never
said--
unknown
speaker
--what
about...
c-11
doesn't
come
within
that
because
it's
not
polluted
enough?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
other
half
of
what
i
said,
that
i'm
thinking
if
you
were
to
be
wrong
on
that,
if
i
thought
you
were
wrong
on
what
you've
said...
assumption...
then
it's
not
so
bad
for
you
because
epa
can
handle
what
i
call
the
california
central
river
valley
project
by
the
costle...
you
know
what
i'm
thinking
of.
leventhal's
opinion
in
kostal.
does
that
ring
a
bell?
nrdc
v.
costle.
does
that
ring
a
bell
to
you?
unknown
speaker
he
lists...
in
that
opinion
there,
he
lists...
he
lists
a
set
of
things
that
epa
could
do
under
the
permit
requirement
that
would,
in
fact,
alleviate
the
administrative
burden
and
would
make
sure
that
all
these
pipes
and
things
in
california
don't
really
have
an
administrative
problem
or
other
problem
by
having
to
go
to
epa
to
get
the
permit.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
there
would
be
another
lawsuit
quite
promptly
if...
if
epa
simply
said
you
automatically
get
a
permit
for
this
type
of
operation?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
we
make
of
information
such
as
that
provided
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
talking
about
the
application
of
the
permit
system
to
interbasin
transfers
in
that
state
and
saying
how
beneficial
it
has
been?
unknown
speaker
it
tells
us
that
it's
been
getting
permits
under
this
federal
scheme
and
that
it's
been
helpful.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that.
you
conceded
that
in
pennsylvania
epa
permits
are
obtained?
unknown
speaker
it's
done
the
same
thing
in
florida.
epa
has
delegated
to
the
state
agency,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
view
that
epa
takes?
unknown
speaker
but
i
notice
that
there's
a
brief
filed
by
former
administrators
and
general
counsel
which
says
that
the
position
of
the
epa
back
in
'75
was
that
of
your
opponent.
unknown
speaker
can
i
make
one
thing
clear?
you
do
not
endorse
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
it
has
to
be
the
point
source
itself
that...
that
causes
the
pollution.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
lehtinen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
says
that?
i
mean,
the...
the
text
we're
dealing
with
here
talks
about
adding
pollutants
to
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
if
you
read
the
two
definitions
together.
and
as
i
see
what's
happened
here,
no
pollutants
have
been
added
to
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
total
amount
of
pollutants
is
the
same.
unknown
speaker
you...
it
could...
it
could
say
to
a
particular
navigable
water.
it
could
have
said
that
very
easily.
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
to
navigable
waters.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
doesn't.
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
do
what
you
say
the
provision
does,
that...
that
is,
to
make
it
unlawful
without
a
permit
to
add
to
a
particular
navigable
water
a
pollutant
that
is
not
already
there
but
that
is
elsewhere
in
the
navigable
waters.
as
it's
written,
all
it
says
is
you
shall
not
add
pollutants
to
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
that's
how
those
definitions
work
out.
and
that
has
not
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
this
provision
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
is
it
just
first
circuit
case
or
is
there
any
history
in
the
epa
over
the
years,
i
guess
30
years,
where
they
did
make
clear
that
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states...
the
discharge
is
not
just
like
one
big
water
where
the
sacramento
river
and
hudson
are
part
of
the
same
big
water?
unknown
speaker
return
flow
from...
from
irrigation
seems
to
me
quite
different.
i
mean,
that
is
taking
something
out
of
the
navigable
waters,
adding
something
to
it,
and
then
returning
it
to
the
navigable
waters.
it's...
it's
the
fertilizer
and...
and
other
pollutants
that
are
picked
up
in
the
irrigation
process
that...
that
is
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
that's
quite
different
from
just
transferring
from
one
navigable
water
to
another.
unknown
speaker
but
why
are
they
different?
they
go
along
and
the
water
is
pure
and
it
sort
of
picks
up
some
drainage
from
tallahassee
or
someplace,
and
now
it's
not
quite
the
same,
and
by
the
time
they
get
it
next
to
the
big
lake
there,
it's
filled
with
stuff,
just
like
the...
just
like
the
stuff
that
drains
off
the
land.
unknown
speaker
well,
apart
from
the...
what...
1972--
unknown
speaker
--general
counsel
opinion,
which...
which
applied
to...
to
return
from...
from
cultivated
land,
do
you...
do
you
deny
that...
that
the
epa
has
never
sought
to
require
permitting
of
this
kind
of
a
facility
for
30
years?
is...
is
that
inaccurate?
unknown
speaker
so
that
states
have
been
violating
the
federal
law
for
30
years
and
nobody
knew
about
it?
unknown
speaker
the
states
have
been
violating
the
federal
law
for
30
years.
unknown
speaker
that's
kind
of
an
extraordinary
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
you
don't...
you
think
the
dam
cases
are
correctly
decided
and
you
don't
need
to
distinguish
them?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
same
water
body
made
no
difference
to
you.
i
thought
neither
side
thought
that
the
answer
to
this
case
depended
upon
whether
it
was
the
same
water
body
or
not.
if...
do
you
think
that
if
it...
if...
if
it
is
established
that...
that
this
is
the
same
water
body,
these
pumps
would
be
okay
without
permitting.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so.
neither
side
takes
that
position.
unknown
speaker
the
dam--
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
about--
--our
problem,
aren't
they,
that...
that
the...
for
you.
that
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
under
your
definition,
it's
going
to
be
the
same
body
of
water.
and
then
if
you
say,
well,
it
didn't
add
any
pollutant
that
wouldn't
have
been
there
otherwise,
i
bet
that
with
most
dams
that
isn't
so,
i
mean,
because
there's
a
lot
of
mud
stirred
up
in
that
lake
behind
the,
say,
boulder,
hoover
dam
and
so
forth.
a
big
problem.
and
if
we
think
of
california
and
the
central
valley
water
project,
my
goodness,
you're
not
going
to
say
that's
all
one
body
of
water.
you
have
the
sacramento,
san
joaquin,
los
angeles.
you
know,
it
goes
all
over
the
place.
and
so
that's
their
big
problem.
they
are
saying
if
you...
if
you
don't
take
a
strong
reading
of
the
dam
cases,
one
that
hurts
you,
we're
suddenly
going
to
find
ourselves
with...
with
water
valley
projects
all
over
the
united
states
and
50
million
permits
required,
and
it
just
won't
work.
all
right.
so
what's
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i
think
we
need
a
separate
body
of
water
requirement
there.
but
what
about
the
other
part
of
what
they
say?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
two
questions
that
i...
i
think
you
may
have
answered,
but
i'm
just
not
sure?
do
you...
in
your
view
is
water
conservation
area
3
and
the
c-11
basin
the
same
body
of
water,
or
are
they
different
bodies?
that's
my
first
question.
my
second
question
is
in
your
view
does
the
record
tell
us
where
the
water
from
the
c-11
basin
primarily
comes
from?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
then
what
about
the
second
question?
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
but
why
does
the...
what
is
the
source
of
the
runoff?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
surely
it
didn't
get
all
their
water
from...
from
rain.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
that
thing
in
the...
the
water
in
the
aquifer
in
turn
comes
largely
from
the
everglades,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
filters
down
to
the
aquifer
from
the
everglades
and
then
seeps
through
to
the
other
side
of
the
levee.
i
thought
it
was...
i
thought
it
was
acknowledged
on
both
sides
that
there's...
that
there's
transfer
of
water
from
the
west
to
the
east
below
the
levee.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
doesn't...
that
doesn't
go
to
the
point
of
whether
it's
the
same
body
of
water
or
not.
i
mean,
whether
it
flows
east
to
west
or
west
to
east,
the
point
is
it's...
it's
the
same
water.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
subsurface
flow
doesn't
count
then
in
this
question.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
this
doesn't
matter
anyway.
you
wouldn't
care
if
it
was
the
same
water
body.
that
isn't...
that
isn't
what
you're
arguing.
unknown
speaker
right,
right.
unknown
speaker
if...
if...
do
you
know
any
place
we
could
look
for
a
definition
of
what
is
the
same
water
body?
is...
is
there
some...
some...
can
i...
you
know,
i'm
not
sure.
unknown
speaker
we
could
try
genesis--
[laughter]
--or
then
the
second--
unknown
speaker
could
you
explain
what's
at
stake
here
practically?
we're
told
that
there
are
other
means
to
deal
with
this
phosphorus
problem.
if
the
permit
you
envision
were
required,
what
would
that
permit
demand?
unknown
speaker
what
is...
what
is
then
the...
the
reason
for
this
litigation?
i
mean,
you...
you
say
you're
just
trying
to
get
them
to
do
what
they
have
already
said
they
are
doing.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
believe
that
they're
doing
it.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
believe
they're
going
to
do
it,
you
know,
in
the
foreseeable
future.
unknown
speaker
look...
look,
when...
when
the
states
require
permitting,
as...
as
they're
allowed
to
do,
they
can
presumably
limit
the
permitting
to
just
the...
the
kind
of
difficult
situations
you're
talking
about,
when
it
is
into
a
pristine
body
of
water
from
a
more
polluted
body
of
water.
but
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
meaning
of
the
act,
permitting
will
be
mandatory
not
just
when...
when
there
are
differences
between
the
pollution
levels
of
the
two
bodies
of
water,
but
whenever
there
is
a
transfer
from
one
body
of
water
to
another.
even
when
the
two
bodies
of
water
are
equally
polluted,
you
would
need
a
permit
because
you
are
adding...
you
are
adding
pollutants.
unknown
speaker
now,
it
may
well
be
you're
adding
pollutants
to
a
body
of
water
that
already
contains
it,
but
you
will
need
a...
a
permit
in
every
case
whenever
any
state
tries
to
do
flood
control
projects
or
any
project
that
requires
the
transfer
of
water
from
one
body
to
another.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
can
you
do
that?
can...
i
mean,
can
epa
issue
a
general
permit,
say
anybody
that--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
have
to
get
it.
you
just...
just--
unknown
speaker
--you
just
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
general
permit.
you
mean
that
applies
to
a
number
of
different
people?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tuesday
the
twentieth
of
january
at
10
o'clock.
