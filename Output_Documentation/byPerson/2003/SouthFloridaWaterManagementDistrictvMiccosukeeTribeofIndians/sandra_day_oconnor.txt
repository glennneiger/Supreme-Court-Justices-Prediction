justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
held
that
the
requirements
of
the
clean
water
act's
national
pollutant
discharge
elimination
system,
the
acronym
for
which
is
npdes,
apply
to
a
water
pumping
station
operated
by
the
petitioner,
the
south
florida
water
management
district.
we
vacate
the
decision
and
remand
it
for
further
proceedings.
the
pump
station
at
issue
is
part
of
a
drainage
system
that
includes
a
canal
and
a
wetland
reservoir
area.
the
canal
drains
water
from
a
developed
area
in
south
florida
and
carries
it
west.
at
the
end
of
the
canal,
the
pump
station
pumps
the
water
into
the
wetland
reservoir.
the
water
in
the
canal
contains
elevated
levels
of
phosphorous
that
come
from
fertilizer
use
in
the
drainage
basin.
when
that
water
enters
the
wetland
reservoir,
the
phosphorous
carried
with
it
causes
ecological
damage,
and
the
tribe,
the
respondent
tribe
here,
claims
that
because
the
pump
station
moves
the
phosphorous
latent
canal
water
into
the
wetland
reservoir,
it
discharges
pollutants
to
navigable
waters
within
the
meaning
of
the
clean
water
act,
and
therefore
needs
an
npdes
permit.
and
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
agreed.
the
water
district
first
argued
before
us
that
the
pump
station
does
not
need
a
permit
because
the
phosphorous
does
not
originate
from
the
pump
station
itself.
we
disagree
with
that
argument
by
its
terms
the
npdes
program
reaches
point
sources
that
merely
convey
pollutants
to
navigable
waters
even
if
those
pollutants
are
generated
elsewhere.
the
water
district
and
federal
government
as
amicus,
also
argued
that
for
purposes
of
this
permit
program,
all
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
should
be
viewed
as
one
undifferentiated
whole.
under
that
view,
moving
water
from
one
water
body
to
another,
could
never
constitute
an
addition
of
pollutants
to
navigable
water
and
the
pump
station
would
not
need
a
permit.
this
argument
however
was
not
presented
below
or
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
we
think
it
is
not
fairly
encompassed
in
the
question
presented.
we
decline
to
resolve
it
here.
we
still
find
it
necessary
to
vacate
the
eleventh
circuitâ€™s
opinion
because
of
a
third
argument
advanced
by
the
water
district.
the
district
claims
that
the
canal
and
wetland
reservoir
are
not
meaningfully
distinct
because
the
two
water
bodies
share
a
close
hydrological
connection.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
tribe
on
this
issue,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
believe,
however,
that
factual
disputes
remain
with
regard
to
this
question,
and
that
summary
judgment
was
therefore
inappropriate.
further
development
of
the
record
is
necessary
to
resolve
the
dispute.
hence,
we
vacate
the
decision
and
remand
for
those
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
written
a
separate
opinion
dissenting
with
respect
to
part
of
the
opinion.
