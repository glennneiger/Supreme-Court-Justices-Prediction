mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
in
the
clean
water
act
provided
that
a
section
402
permit
is
required
for
an
addition
of
pollutants
from
a
point
source
to
navigable
waters.
now,
the
south
florida
water
management
district
concedes
that
the
s-9
pump,
through
which
it
conveys
navigable
waters
from
a
canal
to
a
water
conservation
area,
is
a
confined,
discrete,
discernible
conveyance,
and
we
agree
that
the
water
in
the
c-11
canal
contains
pollution
which
enters
that
water
from
a
wide
variety
of
point
and
non-point
sources.
what
we
do
say
is
that
our
pumps
do
not
add
pollutants
to
navigable
waters.
there
is
no
addition
of
pollutants
to
navigable
waters
when
navigable
waters
are
simply
moved
around,
which
occurs
all
the
time
every
day
all
around
the
country
as
public
water
management
agencies
allocate
and
transfer
the
navigable
waters
to
serve
beneficial
public
purposes.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
no.
it
does
fall
within
the
statute.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it...
it
would
not
require
a
section
402
permit.
there
are
all
sorts
of
layers
of
protection
from
that
occurring.
that
would
never--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no.
that...
that's
not
true
either,
justice
breyer.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
through
the
402,
but
this...
this
is
a
complex
statute
with
many,
many
layers
of
protections
for
the
nation's
waters.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
to
begin
with,
there
is
always
a
layer
of
state
protection.
the
statute
requires
that
water
quality
standards
be
established
for
portions
of
the
navigable
waters.
those
water
quality
standards
are
implemented
through
total
maximum
daily
load
requirements
that
the
states
are...
are
required
under
the
statute
to...
to
design.
the
states
implement
the
tmdl's
and
the
water
quality
standards
through
non-point
source
pollution
programs
that
include
land
use
restrictions,
that
include
advice
to
and
requirements
on
landowners
as
to
best
management
practices.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
no,
it
does
not.
the...
the...
there
are
exceedances.
understand
that
the
s-9
pump,
while
not
permitted
under
402,
is
permitted
by
the
state
under
the
everglades
forever
act.
but
there
are
water
quality
standards
for
the
canal
and
for
the
water
conservation
area.
the...
there
is
compliance
with
both
of
those.
there
are
exceedances,
phosphorus
exceedances,
from
time
to
time,
but
those
are
built
into
the
permit.
the...
the
cleaning
up
of
the
everglades,
which
is
something
that
everyone
is
committed
to
and
the
district
is
deeply
committed
to,
is
not
an
overnight
process.
and
so
there
are
plans
through
the
comprehensive
everglades
restoration
statute
and
also
under
the
everglades
forever
act
to
address
these
exceedances
in
the
long
term,
but--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
i
agree
with
that,
but
we
and
the
united
states
go
further
here
in
arguing
that
the
statute...
what
the
statute
prohibits
is
the
addition
of
pollutants
to
navigable
waters.
navigable
waters
are
defined
in
the
statute
as
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
it's
our
position
and
the
position
of
the
united
states,
if
i
read
their
brief
correctly,
that
an
addition
of
pollutants
from
a
point
source
occurs
when
the
pollutant
is
introduced
to
the
navigable
waters
for
the
first
time.
and
that
is
what
the--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no.
that
would
violate
state
water
quality
standards
which
are--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--it
would
not
require
a
section
402
permit,
justice
souter.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that
is
right.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
assuming
that
it's
a
navigable
water
under
the
clean
water
act--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and
that...
which
is
a
broader
concept
than
waters
that
one
can
run--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--your
premise--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--your
premise
is
incorrect,
justice
breyer.
of
course,
moving
filthy
water
to
a
pristine
water
is
a
problem.
i've
already
explained
that
it's
addressed
and
addressed
comprehensively
and
rigorously
at
the
state
level,
as
congress
contemplated
in
the
statute
through
the
water
quality
standards
and
tmdl's.
but
beyond
that,
it
is
simply
wrong
to
say
that
the
federal
government
lacks
power
in
these
cases.
first
of
all,
it
has
broad
power
under
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
to
protect
navigability,
and
that...
that
provision
also
includes
power
for
the
corps
to
engage
in
a
broad
public
interest
review
whenever
the
course
of
a
waterway
is
changed.
second,
there
are
other
provisions
that
deal
with
emergency
type
situations.
if
public
health
or
welfare,
for
example,
is
implicated,
then
section
504
of
the
statute
gives
epa
broad
powers
to
go
into
court
and
get
a
restraining
order
not
just
for
the
discharge
of
pollutants,
but
much
more
broadly
than
that.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
this
has...
this
has
been
the
focus
of
not
only
our
attention
but
of
the
corps
and
epa's
attention
for
a
long
time
through
the...
the
comprehensive
everglades
restoration
project.
if
i
can...
and
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
are
happening
to...
to
reduce
the
phosphorus
level,
some
of
which
are
sort
of
purely
state
water
quality
standard
implementation
projects,
such
as
prohibiting
the
sale
of
certain
types
of
fertilizers,
restricting
the
use
of
fertilizers
that
contain
phosphorus.
but
the
long-term
cerp
plans
here
have
essentially
two
components.
the
first
one
is
that
much
of
the
water
in
the
c-11
basin,
in
the
canal,
actually
comes
from
the
conservation
area
through
seepage.
there's
an
enormous
amount
of--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
my
understanding
is
that
it
is
seepage.
i
mean,
obviously
there
are--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--that
is
my...
that
is
my
understanding.
there
is
an
enormous
amount
of
seepage,
and
the
seepage
involved--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--from...
from
the
aquifer.
i
mean,
obviously,
in...
in--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--there
is
an
aquifer
that...
an
unconfined
aquifer
that
is
really
indistinguishable
from
the
surface
water
that
underlies
the
levee.
but
it's...
it
is
not
divided
by
the
levee.
it
underlies
the
water,
the
surface
water,
on
both
sides--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--to
the
east
of
the
levees
and
to
the...
it's--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no,
no.
this
is
an
aquifer
that
underlies
both
sides
of
the
levee,
the
wca
and
the
basin.
but
if
i
can
get
back
to...
i
mean,
your...
your
question.
obviously,
the
seepage
is
an
enormous
source.
what
i
am
told
is
that
seepage
alone
will
be
enough
to
flood
out
towns
like--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--there
is
other--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
it's
not
clean.
i
mean,
it
does
contain
pollutants
under
the
definition
of
the
clean
water
act
because
that's
a
broad
definition.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
water
in
the
c-11
canal
that
comes
from
a...
a
wide
array
of
sources
within
the
basin.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
and
that
is...
just
to
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
one
way
that
we
are
addressing
the
phosphorus
here
is
with
the
corps.
the
corps
has
built
a
new
set
of
pumps
right
next
to
the
s-9
that
is
intended
to
intercept
that
cleaner
seepage
water,
and
it
will
pump
that
seepage
water
right
back
into
the
wca
before
it
is
mixed
with
the
more
polluted
waters
from
the
c-11
basin.
so
that
is
one
part
of
the
effort.
it
is
to
get
the
seepage
water
back
into
the
water
conservation
area
before
it
mixes
with
more
polluted
water.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
those
pumps
are--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and
the
solution
to
that
problem
is
that
with
the
corps
and
the
task
force
and
the
epa,
a
number
of
huge
storage
basins
are
being
built.
these
require,
obviously,
buying
a
lot
of
land,
putting
together
the
land
necessary
for
these
sta's.
but
the...
the
purpose
of
the
plans
under
cerp
is
to
stop
as
much
water
as
possible
getting
from
the
c-11
to
the
water
conservation
area.
and
so
storing
as
much
water
as
possible
in
these
basins
will
allow
the
phosphorus
and
other
pollutants
to
settle
out,
and
so
water
that
is...
and
will
also
reduce
the
total
amount
of
water
that
needs
to
be
sent
back
into
the
conservation
area.
the
combination
of
these
new
pumps
getting
the...
the
cleaner
water
back
into
the...
into
the
conservation
area
and
the
storage
basins,
which
will
reduce
the
amount
of
flow
and
allow
the
pollutants
to...
to
seep
down,
is...
is
the
essential
way
in
which
under
cerp
the
problem
of
the
phosphorus
will
be
addressed.
no
one
disputes...
and
the
district
least
of
all
disputes...
that
cleaning
up
the
everglades
and
reducing
the
amount
of
phosphorus
that
gets
into
the
water
conservation
area
which,
in
turn,
feeds
the
everglades
is
a
very
important
consideration.
but
you
also
have
to
understand
that
our
purposes...
we
are
not...
we
are
not
just
dumping
this
water
in...
in
the
water
conservation
area.
this
water
could
be
sent
to
the
ocean.
in
fact,
on
the
eastern
portion
of
the
canal,
the
water
is
sent
to
the
ocean.
but
the...
there
are
other
functions,
important
functions,
that
are
served
by
the
water
conservation
area,
maintaining
water
in
there.
one
is
the
ability
to--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--we
take--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--we
take
the
position,
first
of
all,
that
all
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
are
unitary
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
they
are--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and
the
alternative--
[laughter]
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
we
do
argue--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--the
fall-back
is
precisely
the
one
that
you
have
described,
justice
o'connor,
which
is
that
these
were...
these
were
unitary
waters.
they
are
divided
solely
by
manmade
structures
that
are
changeable
and
are
changing.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
yes,
i
think
the--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--it...
it
did,
but
in
doing
that,
it
ignored
a
number
of
important
considerations.
one
is
the
unitary
aquifer
that
i
have
talked
about.
the
second
is
the
constant
circulation--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--the...
yes.
i...
i
believe
it's
j.a.
177.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
no,
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
no.
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
obviously.
but
i...
but
i
do
think
that
if
there
were
a
level
of
discomfort
with
that
argument,
which
i
think
is...
you
know,
it's
fully
justified
by
the
statute.
and
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
explain
the
other
textual
basis
for...
for
that
argument.
nevertheless--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--the
concept
of
an
addition--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
we
think
that
there
is
more
to
it
than
just
the
term,
navigable
water.
we
think
that...
that
we
do...
we
have
argued
throughout
this
case,
including
in
the
lower
courts,
that
the
navigable
waters
are
a
unitary
concept
for
purposes
of
section
402.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
the
act
does
distinguish.
congress
distinguished,
when
it
wanted
to,
between
the
waters
of
the
united
states
and
specific
portions
of
the
navigable
water.
and
there's
an
example
of
that
at
the
bottom
of
7a
in
the
addendum.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
the
statute
specifies
that
water
quality
standards
which
identify
what
the
goal
is
for
the
level
of
pollutants
in
the
water
and
the
tmdl's,
the
total
maximum
daily
loads,
that
are
used
to
achieve
those
water
quality
standards
are
set
for
specific
portions
or
parts
of
the
navigable
water.
that
is,
the
state...
a
state
role
is
to
identify,
implement,
and
to
enforce
those
water
quality
standards
which
do
apply
to
separate
bodies
of
water.
the
regulations
talk
about
bodies
of
water.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
i
mean,
that's...
that's...
i
mean,
because
of
the
complexities
of
the
act,
that's
not
quite
right.
as
a
definitional
matter,
the
congress
clearly
distinguished
between
the
navigable
waters
and
those
portions
as
to
which
water
quality
standards
were
to
be
set.
in
implementing
water
quality
standards,
a
state
may
take
account
of
the...
of
effluence
reaching
the
water
through
point
sources.
and
in
fact,
there
is
a
separate
provision
of
the
statute--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
just
let
me
run
through,
if
i
may.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
there--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--because
congress
recognized
that
this
is
a
cooperative
federalism
statute
where
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government
has
their
role--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and
in
the
plain
language--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
it
hasn't--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--it
has
been
made
in
the
statute.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
that's
my
run-through.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
navigable
waters
defined
as
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
that
is
backed
up
by
the
use
of
the
broad
term
discharge
in
section
401(a)
where
congress
meant
to
reach
much
more
and
which
isn't
limited
by
this
language
of
an
addition
to
the
navigable
waters.
it
is
backed
up
by
304(f)(2)(f)
where
congress
described
as
non-point
source
pollution
pollution
resulting
from
the
changes
in
the
flow
and
circulation
of
navigable
waters
or
ground
waters
caused
by
flow
diversion
devices
like
the
pump.
and
it's
backed
up
by
the
fact
that
neither
congress
nor
epa
has
ever
at
any
time
since
1972
suggested
that
these
sorts
of
movements
of
water
should
be
governed
by
section
402.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
those
are
the
sta's.
the
regulation
122.2,
the
definitional
regulation,
defines
treatment
areas
as
not
being
navigable
waters.
so
when
you
move
water
from
a
treatment
area
to
a
navigable
water,
that
requires
402
permitting.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
