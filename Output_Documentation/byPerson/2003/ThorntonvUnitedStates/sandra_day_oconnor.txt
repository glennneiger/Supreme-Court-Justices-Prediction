well,
now,
belton
did
involve
a
car
search
after
the
suspects
had
left
the
car
and
were
under
arrest.
they
weren't
in
a
position
to
reach
into
the
car.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
arrested.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
but
then
they
were
disabled
by
the
arrest.
they
couldn't
reach
into
the
car,
and
after
that,
the
search
occurred,
and
we...
we
said,
okay,
that
you
could
search
if...
for
a
recent
occupant
of
the
vehicle.
i
just...
i
think
the
reasons
articulated
in
belton
weren't
all
that
clear,
but
it
may
cover
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
know
from
the
facts
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there...
were
there
reasonable
grounds
here,
do
you
concede
that,
for
the
terry
pat-down
of
petitioner?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
contested?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
i
mean,
there
was
a
terry
stop.
there
was
a
pat-down.
narcotics
were
found.
he
was
arrested.
right?
subsequently
the
search.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
the
vehicle.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
had...
had
the
officer
not
made
an
immediate
search
of
the
vehicle,
presumably
the
police
would
have
to
have
taken
precautions
to
safeguard
the
car
and
make
an
inventory
search
of
it.
so
they're
going
to
find
the
stuff
anyway,
aren't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who...
who--
--unless
the
police
have
a
practice
of
trying
to
safeguard
the
vehicle
since
it...
it
could
be
claimed
later
by
the
person
arrested,
i
had
the
hope
diamond
in
the
back
seat
and
you
people
hauled
me
off
to
jail,
now
you
pay
me
for
the
hope
diamond.
so,
obviously,
they
want
to
inventory
it.
and
i
suppose
virtually
every
police
department
has
regular
provisions
to
safeguard
vehicles
in
those
circumstances
and
do
inventory
searches.
don't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
don't
see
how
we're
furthered
in
our
concerns
by
your
approach.
