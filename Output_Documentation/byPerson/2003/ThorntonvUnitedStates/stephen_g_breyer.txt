justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--belton
must
then
rest
on
some
kind
of
bright
line
administrative
consideration
because
you're
attacking
belton
in
various
ways
which
are
logical.
but
our
problem
i
think
in
this
case
is
to
decide
whether
the
particular
limit
that
you
propose
makes
sense,
and
that's
where
i'm
having
a
problem
because
what
you
say
is
that
the...
the
line
to
be
drawn
around
belton
is
not
just
a
line
of...
in
time
and
space,
which
i
could
understand.
but
you
want
to
say
it
depends
on
whether
the
policeman
initiated
conduct
with
the
individual
before
he
exited
the
car.
and
that
seems
to
me
that
you're
trying
to
distinguish
between
the
case
where
the
policeman
notices
a
wanted
suspect
driving,
pulls
over
to
the
side.
the
police...
the...
the
suspect
takes
off
and
runs
over
to
a
fence.
now,
that
would
be
okay.
that's
belton.
but
the
car
stops
before
the
policeman
recognizes
him.
the
driver
gets
out
and
then
the
policeman
recognizes
him,
and
then
he
takes
off
for
the
fence
and
it's
exactly
the
same.
that
you
would
say
is
not
belton.
now...
now,
that
line
that
you're
drawing
there
to
me...
i...
i
don't
understand
it
at
all
in
terms
of
the
belton
rationale
or
administrative.
it
would
make
it
more
complicated
and
it
wouldn't
achieve
that
much.
it
seems...
in
other
words,
i
want
you
to
explain
why
that
line
is
a
rational
way
of
limiting
belton.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
what
the
question
presented
says.
it
says,
when
the
arrestee
was
not
in
the
car
when
the
police
initiated
contact
with
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
i
thought
you
were
advocating
is
if
the
policeman
was
not
in
the
car
when
the
police
initiated
contact
with
him,
unless
he's
within
reaching
distance,
which
he
isn't...
if
he's
not
in
the
car
when
the
police
initiated
contact
with
him,
then
don't
apply
belton.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
was
the
line
that
i
was
having
trouble
figuring
out
a
justification
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
that
belton
never
applies
as
within
reaching...
if
he's
outside
reaching
distance
of
the
car.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's...
that's
one
possible
rule.
that
would...
that
would
invalidate
what
is
ordinary
police
practice
in
almost
every
place,
which
is
that
they
remove
him,
he's
outside
the
police...
i
take
it
it
would.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
mean,
i
understand
the
argument,
and
it's
been
made
many
times
and
there's
a
lot
of
logic
to
it.
but
it's
been
pretty
consistently
rejected.
so...
but
i
got
it.
at
least
i
understand
it
and...
and
maybe
it
will
be
accepted
or
not.
but
let's
put
that
one
aside,
the
reaching
distance
point.
do
you
want
to
defend
the
other
distinction
your
making,
which
i
take
it
is
even
if
you
lose
on
reaching
distance,
still
belton
does
not
apply
if
the
initial
contact
was
made
between
the
police
and
the...
and
the
suspect
outside
the
car?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
want
to
give
up
on
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
you
want
to
defend
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
defend
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
escalates
the
danger
of
the
situation.
i
mean,
why...
what
sensible
regime
would
say,
police
officer,
don't
take
the
precaution
of
waiting
to
make
the
arrest
till
the
person
stops
and
gets
out
of
the
car?
that
way,
police
officer,
you
won't
be
in
danger
of
the
man
grasping
for
a
gun.
or
suppose
it's
a
case
where
the
police
want
to
follow
that
car
and
not
signal
because
they
want
to
find
out
where
the
crack
house
is
that
he's
going
to.
so
if
they
signal,
they
make
initial
contact,
they
give
away
the
whole...
the
whole
thing.
they
will
not
find
the
destination
they're
looking
for.
to...
to
say
that
belton
is
okay
but...
in
those
situations
the...
the
police
would
not
have
the
possibility
of
within
moments
after
the
suspect
exits
the
car
arresting
him
and
then
doing
a
car
search.
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
instead
of
complicating
it...
take
belton
as
a
given.
sorry.
were
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
would
it...
do
you
think
it
would
work...
or
why
wouldn't
work...
to
try
to
control
belton
by
imposing
limits
on
what's
reasonable
time
and
reasonable
space
so
that
you
keep
it
really
to
a...
an
arrest
that
took
place
really
when
he
was
just
within
the
car
and
not
too
far
away
unless
it's
his
fault
because
he
took
off?
all
right.
now,
you'd
do
that
through
a
common
law
approach.
the
lower
courts
would
make
their
decisions
and
occasionally
we
could
review
one
to
say
it
went
too
far
one
way
or
the
other.
that,
it
seems,
is
a...
is
a
procedure
for
imposing
limits
on
belton
that...
that
might
work.
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
you'd
have
to...
you
can't
get...
unfortunately,
language
is
what
it
is,
and...
and
sometimes
efforts
to
make
it
clearer
make
matters
worse.
so
one
way
to
control,
in
the
presence
of
vague
language,
is
through
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
long
after
he
got
out
of
the
car
did
the
arrest
take
place?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
moments?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
how
far--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
the
police
departments
normally
tell
the
policemen?
what
do
they
say?
they
say,
when
you
arrest
a
person
who
just
got
out
of
a
car,
you
can
search
the
car?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
asking
the
practice.
i'm
asking...
the
virtue
of
belton
is
supposed
to
be
it's
simple.
explain
it
to
a
policeman.
so
i
want
to
know
how
do
they
explain
it.
i
thought
perhaps
they
explain
it
by
saying,
policeman,
if
you
arrest
a
person
who's
just
got
out
of
a
car,
you
can
search
the
car.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
if
that's...
then
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
limit
on
just
got
out
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
inevitably
we're
in
the
business
of
trying
to
say
what's
just
got
out
of.
is
it
a
minute?
is
it
2
minutes?
is
it
5
minutes?
there's
no
way
to
avoid
that,
is
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
in
your
opinion
is
the
outer
margin?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
well
within
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you'd
say
certainly
a
day
is
too
long
i
imagine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
perhaps
we
could
use
words
like
just
got
out
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
seconds?
