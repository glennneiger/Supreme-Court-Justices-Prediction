justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
reasonable?
why
doesn't
he
tell
him,
look
it,
move
off,
get...
get
10
yards
away
from
the
car,
get
20
yards
away,
however?
i...
i
mean,
you...
you
don't
really
suggest
that
there
is
a
necessity
to
conduct
a
belton
search
in
order
to
protect
the
officer.
all
he
has
to
do
is
say,
get
away
from
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
policeman
make
him
stay
within
reaching
distance?
wait.
don't...
don't
get
any
further
than
that.
i
want
you
to
stay
right
there.
