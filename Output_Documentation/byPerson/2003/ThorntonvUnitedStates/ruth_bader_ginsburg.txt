how
about
moments?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
search
until
the...
belton
was...
wasn't
he
in...
in
the
patrol
car
by
the
time
they
started
the
search?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
so
i...
that's
what
i
don't...
it's
quite
different
from
search
into...
incident
to
arrest.
the...
the
area
around
the
defendant,
the
defendant
may
still
grab
a
gun.
but
the
one
thing
we
know
is
that
when
the
defendant...
when
the
suspect
is
sitting
in
the
patrol
car
with
handcuffs
on,
there
isn't
any
danger
that
the
police
faces
when
they're
doing
the
search.
when
they
arrested
him,
yes,
but
not
when
they
search...
do
the
search.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
don't
object
to
the
search
taking
place
when
there's
no
danger
to
the
officer,
but
you
say
in
order
to
do
that
non-dangerous
search,
the
officer
has
to
put
himself
in
danger
when
he
makes
the
arrest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
this...
this
officer
lets
mr.
thornton
go
to
the
shopping
mall
but
is
standing
guard
next
to
the
car
and
mr.
thornton
then
comes
back,
enters
the
car
and
just
as
he
enters,
the
police
officer
says,
you're
arrested.
then
he
could
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what...
why
i
asked
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
say
we're
not
going
to
initiate
contact
while
he's
in
the
vehicle,
but
the
minute
he
gets
out,
we
will
arrest
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
he
have
to
at
least
see
the
suspect
in
the
car
or
would
it
be
all
right
under
the
rule
you're
proposing
where
the
police
that
come
upon
the
scene
just
after
the
suspect
exits
from
the
car?
