mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sole
contention
advanced
by
petitioner
on
appeal
was
that
the
search
of
his
car
was
not
lawful
under
the
rule
of
new
york
v.
belton
because
officer
nichols
did
not
succeed
in
initiating
contact
with
him
while
he
was
still
inside
his
car.
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
rejected
that
contention.
to
begin
with,
petitioner's
initiation
of
contact
rule
has
no
foundation
in
the
rationale
of
belton.
it
is
the
fact
of
the
arrest
and
not
the
reason
that
the
person
exited
the
car
that
gives
rise
to
the
justification
for
the
belton
search.
the
custodial
arrest
is
an
extremely
dangerous
and
volatile
encounter
for
the
officer
in
the
field,
and
that's
particularly
true
in
the
case
of
the
arrest
of
a
recent
occupant
of
a
vehicle.
in
belton,
this
court
drew
the
generalization
that
when
the
recent
occupant
of
a
vehicle
is
arrested,
that
the
inside
of
the
vehicle
is
always
within
the
area
in
which
that
occupant
might
try
to...
try
to
lunge
in
order
to
get
a
weapon
to
effect
his
escape
or
to
grab
evidence
to
conceal
it
or
destroy
it
in
the
car.
now,
the
application
of
that
generalization--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
but
the
court
did
use
the
term
recent
occupant
at
page
460
of
its
decision.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true,
and...
and
in
describing
the
category
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
justice
stevens.
i...
i
actually
don't
think
that
that's
correct.
i
think
the
frick
case,
which
is
discussed,
listed
with
the
cases
discussed
at
page
459
of
the
decision,
involved
the
situation
where
the
police
came
upon
the
person
in
a
parking
lot,
and
in
that
situation...
which
was
one
of
the
cases
that
the
court
identified
as
the
disarray
in
the
case
law
that
existed
before
belton.
and
that's
a
critical
point
for
the
court
to
understand
in
weighing
the...
the
petitioner's
reaching
distance
argument
here.
this
court
knows
what
the
world
is
like
in
a
reaching
distance
regime
under
chimel
and
the
important
context
in
which
the
recent
occupant
of
a
car
is
arrested.
as
the
court
mentioned
in...
in
belton,
it's
a
world
in
which
there's
disarray
and
confusion
in
the
case
law,
more
litigation
and
more
confusion
for
the
officer
in
the
field.
the
court
noted
on
page
460
of
its
decision
in
belton
that
that
kind
of
confusion
was
not
helpful
to
the
police
who
need
clear
rules
for
the
scope
of
their
authority
in
this
context.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it's...
it's
artificial,
justice
stevens,
and
it's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
is
a
clear--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
with
respect,
we
think
it's
an
artificial
rule,
and...
and
if
i
could--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
i...
i
think
a
rule
which...
which
takes
into
account
the
justifications--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but...
but
it--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
i
could
respond
in
this
way.
first,
the
vast
majority
of
arrests
that
take
place
in
the
belton
context,
including
in
this
case,
including
in
belton
itself,
take
place
after
the
person
is
already
outside
of
the
car.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
that's
true.
and...
and
let
me
talk,
if
i
could,
about
the
artificiality
of
that
rule
and
why
we
think
it's
not
a
rule
that
the
court
should
adopt.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
let
me
answer
both
questions.
i...
i
don't
think
that
that
is
going
to
be
a
clearer
rule
than
the
rule
that
we're
asking
for
in
this
case.
and...
and
to
respond
to
your
second
question
as
to
what
is
a
recent
occupant,
in
our
view
it's
someone
who's
just
occupied
the
car.
it's...
it's
the
person
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
in
which
this
question
has
arisen.
in
this
case
it
was
clear
that
officer
nichols
met
petitioner
moments
after
he
exited
the
car,
and
that's
going
to
be
the
situation
in
which
this
question
has
arisen
and
it
can
arise
in
a
number
of
ways.
in
michigan
v.
long,
the
police--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
the...
the
recency
test
that
the
court...
that
we
think
the
adopted
or
described
in
belton
is
one
that's
tethered
to
the
proximity
of
the
automobile.
and
there
are
going
to
be
line-drawing
problems
at
the
outer--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's...
it's
someone...
it's
the
person
who
has
gotten
out
of
the
car
and
who's
in
the
same
proximity
to
the
car
that
he
would
have
occupied
if
he
had
been
ordered
out.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
and
it
is
in
a
typical
belton
case.
if
i
could
give
the
court
an
example.
the
federal
law
enforcement
training
center
trains
its
officers
that
they
should
stop
their
police
car
within
two
to
four
lengths
of
the
vehicle
that
they're
stopping
and
to
pull
the
person
out
of
the
car
prior
to
the
arrest.
and
this
is...
this
is
the
way
officers
are
trained
to
bring
them
back
because
of
the
inordinate
risks
that
officers
face
in
that
situation.
in
this
case,
officer
nichols
intended
to
pull
petitioner
over.
that's
at
page
16
of
the
j.a.,
but
he
didn't
succeed
in
doing
so
because
the
petitioner
pulled
into
a
parking
lot.
and
that's
not
an
uncommon
practice
that...
that
suspects
do
if
they...
if
they
feel
or
sense
that
they're
under
surveillance
by
the
police.
and
he
got
out
of
his
car,
and
the
record
shows
at
page
11
of
the
j.a.
that
officer
nichols
got
out
at
the
same
time
and
met
him
within
moments.
this
is...
this
case
we
think
has
the
hallmarks
of
the
classic
belton
encounter.
officer
nichols
patted
him
down,
found
drugs
on
his
person,
and
at
that
moment,
placed
him
under
arrest.
the...
the
pat-down
was
a
consensual
search.
that's...
that's
indicated
at
page
19
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
at
the
moment
that
he
placed
petitioner
under
arrest
who,
after
all,
was
a
convicted
felon
who
just
had
drugs
on
his
person
and
who
had
a
loaded
semi-automatic
gun--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
souter,
and
that's
an
important
aspect
of
the
generalization
that
the
court
drew
in
belton
and...
and
that
underlies
the
search
incident
to
arrest
cases
which
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--my...
my
point,
justice
souter,
was
that
the
officer
safety
justification
for
belton
is
going
to
be
squarely
implicated
regardless
of
the
reason
that
the
person
got...
got
out
of
the
car.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
sure.
and...
and
we
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
any
less
bright
in
the
most
common
situation
in
which
this
question
has
arisen
where
police
come
upon
the
person
right
as
he's...
as
he's
exiting
his
car.
michigan
v.
long
is
another
example.
that
case
was
decided
two
terms
after
belton.
and
in
that
case
this
court
indicated
in
dictum
that
belton
would
apply
in
the
situation
where
the
police
come
upon
the
person
after
he's
outside
of
the
car.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it's...
it's
going
to
have
both...
and
the
court
of
appeals
emphasized
it
in
this
case
at
page--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
both
space
and
time
and
it's
going
to
encompass
a
situation
where
the
person
has
just
gotten
out
of
the
car--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
under
the
position
that
petitioner
advances--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
souter,
as
in
the
case
of
any
fourth
amendment
case,
there...
there
are
going
to
be
situations
at
the
margin.
i
think
if...
if
the
person
is
racing
away
from
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
the
hypothetical
is
the
person
sees
the
police
officer
and
races
away
from
the
car,
the
police
officer
arrests
the
person
in
the
vicinity
of
the
car,
then
no,
i
don't
think
it
matters
if
he
got
15
feet
or
20
feet
or
30
feet.
if
he
gets
a
block
away,
then
sure,
it
might
matter.
these
are
cases
at
the
outer
extreme
or
margin
and
aren't
implicated
by
the
commonly
recurring
fact
pattern
in
which
this
case
arises
where
the
police
meet
the
person
in
the
same
spot
that
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
been
ordered
out
of
the
car.
and...
and
let
me
talk
about
the
problems
with
line-drawing
that
the
court
is
going--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--of
course,
there's
something
absent
there
which
is
the
positive
linkage.
the
police
don't
know
that
that
person
has
just
gotten
out
of
the
car.
that...
that
case
is
a
lot
like
the
frick
case
that
the
court
noted
in
belton
as
one
of
the
cases
that
it
was
trying
to
deal
with
when
it
came
up.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
the
police--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i...
i
think
in
that
situation
where
the
person
was
arrested
right
by
the
car,
we
think
that
belton
probably
would
apply.
but
that's
not
the
fact
pattern
initiated
here.
if...
if
i
could
just
talk
about
the
line-drawing
problems
that
the
court
is
going
to
invite
if
it
adopts
petitioner's
initiation
of
contact
rule.
the...
the
petitioner
said
today
that...
that
the
rule
the
court
ought
to
adopt
if
the
light
is
on,
then
belton
is...
is
on.
well...
well,
that's
going
to
create
line-drawing
problems.
to
take
an
example
close
to
home,
the...
the
police
officers
in
the
district
of
columbia
often
drive
around
with
white
flashing
lights
on.
now,
i'm
not
sure
how
the
existence
of
those
white
flashing
lights
would
come
into
play
under
petitioner's
initiation
of
contact
rule.
take
the
case
that
the
court
had
before
it
this
fall,
arizona
v.
gant,
which
was
a
case
that
presented
the
same
issue,
but
the
court
vacated
and
remanded
it
in
light
of
the
arizona
supreme
court's
decision
which
rejected
the
initiation
of
contact
rule.
in
that
case,
the
officer
came
upon
the
suspect
and
he
shined
a
flight...
shined
a
flashlight
into
the
car
which
the
suspect
was
still
inside
the
car.
the
suspect
got
out
of
the
car.
the
officer
met
him
moments
later,
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
said
that
the
police
officer
hadn't
sufficiently
initiated
contact
with
the
suspect
while
he
was
still
in
the
car.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
held
in
that
case.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and...
and
in
describing
that,
the
court
listed
the
number
of
different
factors
that
would
have
to
go
into
the
calculus
both
from
the
standpoint
of
the
officer
on
the
scene
and
from
a
court
later
reviewing
that
determination
as
to
whether
the
officer
initiated
contact.
he'd
have
to
take
into
account
the
lighting
in
the
situation,
how
far
the
officer
was
the
car
when
he...
away
from
the
car
when
he
shined
the
flashlight
into
it,
whether
the
person
saw
the
flashlight,
whether
the
person
thought
it
was
a
police
officer
shining
the
flashlight
or
someone
else,
whether
the
person
was
aware
that
there
was
a
police--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
we
are.
if...
if
the
court
focuses--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if...
of
course,
that's...
that's
not
the
fact
pattern
here.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
i
think
he
probably
would
be
able--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in...
in
that
case
where
the
person--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
the
person
comes
out
and
is
right
next
to
the
car
in
the
place
he
would
have
been
when
he
had
been
ordered
out,
yes,
we
think
that...
that
belton
would
apply
in
that
situation.
but...
but
the
rule
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
adopt
here
is
that
on
this
fact
pattern,
which
as
the
court
of
appeals
we
think
correctly
recognized
has
temporal
and
spatial
limits,
where
the
police
see
the
person
exit
the
car,
confront
him
moments
later,
the
application
of
the
bright
line
rule
in
belton
shouldn't
depend
on
the
fortuity
of
whether
the
police
initiate
contact
with
that
person
beforehand.
and
that's
particularly
true
in
a
case
like
this
where
officer
nichols
intended
to
pull
the
car
over
and...
and
yet
didn't
do
so
because
the
suspect
did
what
suspects
sometimes
do,
which
is
to
pull
over
and
get
out
in
order
to
try
to
blend
in.
the...
now,
going
back
to
the
officer
safety
rationale,
we
think
that
is
a
justification
for
belton
and
that
it
is
implicated
in
this
situation
and
that
the
initiation
of
contact
rule
would
implicate
officer
safety
in
a
number
of
ways.
one
is
the
surveillance
situation
that
was
mentioned
during
petitioner's
argument
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
in
this
case.
in...
in
some
cases,
officers
are
engaged
in
surveillance
activities
and
maybe
determine
that
it's
undesirable
and
unsafe
to
make
contact
with
a
suspect
while
he's
still
inside
the
car
and
so
take
the
prudent
step
of
waiting
for
the
suspect
to
step
out
of
the
car
before
confronting
him.
the...
the
case
out
of
virginia,
the
glasco
case
that's
discussed
in
the
brief,
is
an
example
of
that.
there's...
there's
also
the...
the
possibility,
which
is
recognized
in
the
case
law,
that
an
initiation
of
the
contact
rule
would
have
the
effect
of
increasing
the
volatility
of
belton
encounters
by
creating
a
dynamic
in
which
suspects
had
an
incentive
to
race
out
of
the
car
before
police
could...
could
initiate
contact.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
there
is
danger,
justice
kennedy.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
on...
on
the
handcuff--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--right.
there
is
danger.
and
we...
we...
and
it's
true
in...
in
a
stop
and
arrest
like
this
case
where
there's
a
lone
officer
and
a
person
who
he
arrests.
and
the...
the
deeply
ingrained
practice
in
this
country
is
for
the
officer
to
put
the...
the
suspect,
arrestee,
in
the
squad
car
and
then
go
back
and
search
the
car.
and...
and
we
cite
cases
on
page
38
of
our
brief
where...
where
suspects
have
escaped
from
handcuffs
and
gotten
out.
and...
and
that
danger
is
remote,
but
we
think
that
it's
still
real
as
long
as
the
suspect
is
at
the
scene
of
the
arrest.
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
we're
aware
that...
that
have
considered
this
question
and
professor
lafave
who's...
who's
recognized
that
have
concluded
that
belton
applies
when
the
person
is
handcuffed
in
the
back
seat
of
the
squad
car.
and
of
course,
justice
brennan
in
his
dissent
in
belton
recognized--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the...
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
is...
is
no
because
the
record
doesn't...
what
the
record
shows...
and
this
is
on
page
50
of
the
j.a.
i
think...
is
that
the
officer
arrested
petitioner,
put
him
in
the
car
and
then
went
back
and
searched
the
car.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
the
officer
needed
keys.
but...
but
on
the
inventory
search
question,
although
it
may
be
true
in
some
cases
that
the
inventory
search
inevitably
would
have
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
contraband,
in
that
sense
the
privacy
interests
of
the
person
from
a
belton
search
at
the
time
are...
are
further
diminished.
the
inventory
search
i
don't
think
is
an
answer
to
the
officer's
safety
concerns
and
justification
for
belton,
which
are
real
as
long
as
the
person
is
still
at
the
scene
of
the
arrest.
there
is
the
remote
risk
that
the
person
can
escape
and
try
to
get
back
into
the
car.
there's
also
the
risk,
as...
as
you
mentioned
i
think,
that
there
could
be
confederates
in
the
area
who
might
try
to
get
into
the
car,
either
for
a
weapon
or
to
get
drugs
out
of
the
car
or
other
contraband
out
of
the
car.
officers
in...
in
the
belton
stop,
it's
not
uncommon
for
them
to...
to
have
the
person
out
of
the
car,
to
secure
him,
and
then
it's
only
at
that
point
that
they...
that
they
feel
safe
to
go
back
to
make
sure
that
there's
no
one
else
in
the
car
who
could
be
hidden
in
the
car
or
other
things
in
the
car.
so
i...
so
we
don't
think
that
the
inventory
search
is
an
answer
to
the
very
real
concerns
that
the
officers
face
in
conducting
the
belton
search
and
that
provide
the
rationale
for
the
belton
search.
i
wanted
to
just
go
back
briefly
to
the
court's
decision
in
michigan
v.
long.
and
although
it
is
dictum
in
that
case
on
the
application
of...
of
belton,
we
do
think
that
it's...
it's
persuasive
dictum.
in
that
case
the
police
officers
saw
a
car
swerve
off
the
road,
and
they...
they
came
around
back
to
investigate.
the
petitioner...
or...
or
the
suspect
in
that
case,
the
individual
who
was
driving
the
car,
was
already
outside
of
the
car
when
the
police
came
back.
and...
and
the
court
in
that
case
made
quite
clear
in
dictum
that
if
the...
if
the
suspect
in
that
case
had
been
arrested,
that
the
search
of
his
car
would
have
been
perfectly
lawful
under
belton.
and
we
think
that
that
was...
that
is
a
persuasive
and
a
correct
understanding
of
belton.
if
i
could...
i
wanted
to
make
clear
too
that
we
think
that
this
case
does
bear
the...
the
hallmarks
of
a
classic
belton
encounter.
the
only
difference
is...
is
that
officer
nichols
did
not
succeed
in
initiating
contact
before
the
suspect
got...
got
out
the
car,
but
officer--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
think
that
the...
the
most
important
thing
for
the
court
to
hold
in
this
case...
that
we
would
ask
the
court
to
hold
in
this
case
is
in
the
commonly
recurring
situation
where
police
see
the
person
exit
the
car
and
confront
him
moments
later
in
the
same
vicinity
that
he
might
have
occupied
if
he
had
been
ordered
out
of
the
car,
that
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
for
the
purposes
of
applying
belton
as
to
whether
or
not
the
police
succeeded
in
initiating
contact
or
succeeded
in
initiating
contact
in
a
sufficient
way.
there
may
be...
there
are
going
to
be
other
cases
that
arise,
and...
and
we
don't
think
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
court
should
try
to
establish
a
rule
which
is
tethered
to
a
particular
distance
or...
or
a
particular
amount
of
time.
these
are...
this
is
an
extremely
dangerous
encounter
for
police.
this
is
an
area
in
which
police
need
to
make
judgments.
this
court
recognized
in
the
lagovista
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
that...
that's
not
what
we're
asking
for,
and
i'm
sorry
if
i...
if
i
misled
the
court.
we're
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
generalization
that
it
adopted
in
belton.
the...
the
reaching
distance
rule
that
petitioner
has
alternatively
asked
for
would
just
eviscerate
belton
and
put
courts
and
police
officers
back
in
the
situation
that
they
occupied
before
belton
in
trying
to
apply
chimel
in...
in
the
recurring
and
dangerous
context
of
an
automobile
stop.
the
court
recognized
in
belton
on
page
59
of
its
decision
that
that...
the
chimel
analysis
had...
had
provided
to
be...
shown
to
be
unworkable
in
this
context
and...
and
had
created
litigation
for
the
courts
and
uncertainty
for
the
police
officers.
so
we're
asking
the
court
to...
to
stick
to
that
bright
line.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
handcuffing
in
the
squad
car,
i...
i
did
want
to
make
clear
on
that
point
that
that
argument
was
not
raised
by
petitioner
below,
and...
and
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
at
page
74,
note
2
of
the
joint
appendix.
it's
not
pressed
by
petitioner
in
this
court.
i
think
petitioner's
reply
brief
makes
that
clear
on
page
16.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
in
terms
of...
of...
i...
i
can
tell
you
what
the
practice
is
at
the
federal
law
enforcement
training
center.
and...
and
that
practice
is
you...
is...
is
to
take
the...
the
person
outside
of
the
car,
ordinarily
away
from
the
car
back
towards
the
police--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's...
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and...
and
if
it's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
there's
not
at
the
outer
margins,
but...
but
the
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
let
me...
let
me
say
affirmatively
that
this
case
we
think
places
a
proper
temporal--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
spatial
limits
on
it
where
it's
clear
that
the
person--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--of
course.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct.
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
hold
in
this
case
that
belton
applies
in
this
situation
where
the
police
confront
the
person
just
after
he
gets
out
of
the
car,
that
is
going
to
provide
a
guidance
to
the
police
officers.
and
that's
going
to
tell
them
they
don't
need
to
undertake
this
additional
fact-specific
analysis
as
to
whether
the
person
got
out
of
the
car
of
their
own
volition
or
an
initiation
of
contact.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
or
within
moments.
and...
and
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--seconds
would
be
fine.
but...
but
no.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
and...
and
that's...
that's
a
different
fact
pattern
that
has
arisen.
we
think
belton
would
apply
in
that
situation,
and
police
we
think
have
reasonably
concluded
that
and
courts
have
reasonably
concluded
that.
but...
but
that's
not
the
question
here.
and
the
most
important
question
for
the
court
to
answer,
which
is
the
situation
where
the
police
do
see
the
person
get
out
of
the
car
and
do
confront
him
moments
later.
the...
the
states...
a
number
of
states
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
supporting
the
government's
position
and...
and
urging
against
adoption
of
an
initiation
of
contact
rule.
and...
and
we
do
think
it's
significant
that
each
of
the
states
and
jurisdictions
that
have
adopted
the
initiation
of
contact
rule,
states
like
florida
and...
and
illinois
and
michigan,
have
signed
that
brief
and
urged
the
court
to
reject
the
initiation
of
contact
rule.
we
think
that
that
rule
is
unworkable.
it's
shown
to
be
unworkable
in
cases
like
gant
v.
arizona.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
added
wrinkles
have
been
applied
to
the
rule.
there's
a
florida
case,
which
is
not
discussed
in
the
briefs,
but
it
is
publicly
reported.
it's
kavallierakis
v.
state,
790
s.
2d
1201.
in
that
case,
the
courts
in
florida,
applying
the
initiation
of
contact
rule,
concluded
that
in
order
to
trigger
belton,
the
contact
had
to
be
of
a
confrontational
nature
and
not
of
a
friendly
nature,
so
that
in
that
case,
the
courts
reversed
a
conviction
for
possession
of
drugs
found
in
a
car
because
the
police
officer
met
the
person
with
a
greeting
while
he
was
getting
out
of
the
car
as
opposed
to
a
confrontational
signal
such
as
a...
as
a
siren
or
a
light.
now,
that...
that
seems
like
an
extreme
application
of
that
rule,
but
it's
nevertheless
indicative
of...
of
the
variations
in
the
line-drawing
that
can
arise
and
that
have
arisen.
in
this
case
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
held
that
belton
apply.
the
record
conclusively
shows
that
petitioner
was
a
recent
occupant
of
the
car
and
the
search
was
contemporaneous
with
the...
the
arrest,
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
