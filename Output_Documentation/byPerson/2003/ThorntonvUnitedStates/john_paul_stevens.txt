justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
point...
my
point
is
i
assume
it
happens
anyway.
now,
empirically
i
may
be
wrong.
then
that's
a
different
case.
well,
it
is
clear,
is
it
not...
i...
if
i
remember
belton,
it
is
clear
that
the
belton
rule
applies
to
any
arrest.
it
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
an
arrest
in
which
they
will
impound
the
car.
you
could
be
caught
for
speeding.
that's
what
they
stopped
him
for
in
belton.
they
were
speeding.
and
so
i
think
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
is
not
the
facts
of
belton.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
not
only
allows
search
of
the
vehicle
but
of
every
container
in
the
vehicle.
so
everybody
who's
caught
speeding
has
his
vehicle...
everything
in
that
vehicle
is
subject
to
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
point
out
that
the
question
presented
in
belton
defined
it
as
an
occupant
of
the
vehicle?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
also
used
occupant
several
times
in
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
the
examples
that
it
gave,
as
your
opponent
indicated,
all
were...
except
one
possible
exception,
all
were
occupants,
weren't
they,
in...
in
the
cases
that
justice
stewart--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
if
you
emphasize
the
clarity...
and
that's
what
justice
stewart
did.
he
drafted
what
he
thought
was
a
very
clear
rule.
if
you
limit
it
to
occupants,
isn't
that
equally
clear
as
the
rule
you
propose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
agree
it's
artificial,
but
is
it
not
equally
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
is
it
not
more
clear?
because
i
don't
know
when
you
stop
being
a
recent
occupant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
an
artificial
rule.
we
all
agree
with
that,
but
what
we're...
what
we're
looking
for
is
a
clear
artificial
rule.
that's
the
purpose
of
belton.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
reason
it's
artificial
is
it
explains
that
normally
chimel
would
control,
and
he
said
we
want
a
special
rule
for...
for
arrests
of
occupants
of
cars.
and
that's
what
they
did.
and
we...
and
they
made
it
so
you
can
search
the
entire
vehicle.
that's
the
other
important
part
of
belton.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
entire...
all...
all
containers
in
the
vehicle
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
contact
with
the
police
is
when
they're
occupants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
an
answer
to
this
question.
i
agree
it's
artificial.
it's
described
in
belton
as
artificial.
but
the
search
in
belton
was
for
the
clearest
rule
available,
and
my
suggestion
to
you
is
the
rule
of
belton,
as...
as
described
in
belton
itself
applying
to
occupants
of
the
cars
at
the
time
of
contact,
is
clearer
than
a
rule
defined
by
recent
occupant
because
what
is
a
recent
occupant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
your
rule
apply
to
someone
who
was
out
of
the
car
for
5
minutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
your
definition
of
recent
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is...
in
other
words,
geography
is
part
of
the
time
dimension
of
recency.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
said
a
little
while
ago
there
are
cases
on
the
fringe.
of
course,
you
can
always
find
one
or
two
cases
that
present
these
difficult
problems.
but
are...
are
you
really
contending
that
the
rule
of
initiating
contact
is
less
bright
than
the
rule
you're
proposing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if,
for
example,
the...
the
officer
saw
a
person
speeding,
he
pulls
into
a
gas
station,
he
gets
out,
goes
to
the
men's
room
and
comes
back
out.
can
he
be...
can
you
search
his
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
just
not...
i'm
just
wondering--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
wondering
about
the
integrity
of
your
statement
that
there's
a
real
bright
line
rule
there.
and
what
do
you
do
with
my
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's...
this...
the
officer
saw
him
speeding
but
he
didn't
turn
the
light
on.
he
followed
him.
the
guy
goes
into
a
gas
station,
goes
to
the
men's
room,
comes
out
2
minutes
later.
can
you
search
his
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
that
we
don't
want
a
bright
line
rule.
we
want
a...
a
facts
and
circumstances
rule
and
take
everything
into
account,
which
is
sort
of...
justice
scalia
often
speaks
of
those
rules
with
some
disparaging
terms.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
your
time
is
up?
in
your
experience,
does
an
inventory
search
include
the
right
to
search
containers
in
the...
in
the
car?
belton,
of
course,
gives
the...
the
government
the
big
advantage.
you
can
search
every
container
in
the
car.
