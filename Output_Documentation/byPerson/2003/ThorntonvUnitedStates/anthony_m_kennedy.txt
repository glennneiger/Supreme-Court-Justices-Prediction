well,
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
o'connor's
questions
are...
are
getting
to
your
comment
that
belton
is
a...
is
a
fiction.
and
maybe
it's
not
a
fiction.
maybe
the
officer,
at
the
time
he
conducts
the
search,
is
not
in
immediate
danger,
but
if
he
left
the
vehicle
without
conducting
the
search,
a
confederate
can
come
by.
there
could
be
somebody
with
another
key.
a
passer-by
can
come
and
get
the
gun
if
the
car
isn't
locked,
and
there's
going
to
be
an
inventory
search
anywhere...
anyway.
so
belton,
rather
than
being
a
fiction,
makes
a
good
deal
of
sense
in
terms
of
safety,
maybe
not
safety
at
the
time
the
officer
is
making
the
very
search.
maybe
that's
somewhat
fictional.

houses
are...
houses
are
stationary
and
cars
are
not.
so
we
have
to
draw
the
line
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why...
why
don't
we
save
ourselves
a
lot
of
trouble
and
say
that
in
almost
all
of
these
cases,
the
police
have
an
interest
in
what
happens
to
the
vehicle,
they're
going
to
take
it
away
anyway,
so
they
might
as
well
do
the
inventory
search
right
away?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
i
mean,
does
it
make
a
lot
of
sense
if
in
most
cases,
which
i...
which
i
assume
to
be
so...
i
may
be
wrong.
in
most
cases,
especially
when
the
car
is
on
a...
on
a
street
or
in...
in
a...
in
a
parking
lot...
it's
not
at
the
residence...
they're
going
to
have
to
tow
that
car
and...
and
check
it.
they
probably
should
make
sure
it's
locked
before
they
leave
so
that
nothing
will
be
taken
from
the
car,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
no,
my
case...
my
case
says
there's
been
an
arrest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the...
if
the
suspect
is
handcuffed
and
is
in
the
police
cruiser,
is
there
any
danger
to
the
officer
at
that
point
that
can't
be
equally
avoided
by
simply
having
an
inventory
search
later?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
a
single
occupant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
it
applies,
but
it's
just
not
clear
to
me
why
an
inventory
search
can
never
be,
which...
i
have
only
one
factual
question
here.
was
this
car
locked
before
the
police
officer
searched
it?
did
he
need
the
key
or
do...
do
we
know?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
about
in
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
about
in
this...
this
is
a
serious
question.
what
about
if
he's
just
about
to
get
into
it?
