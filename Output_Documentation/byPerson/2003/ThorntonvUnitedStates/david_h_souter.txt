justice
david
h.
souter
--so
if--
--so
if
the
car
were...
the
car
door
were
unlocked
and
his
reach
would
have
been
long
enough
to
get
inside
the...
the
car
if
the
door
were
open,
he
could
search
into
the
car?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
does
that
matter?
we
don't
know
that.
the
police
don't
know
that.
that
doesn't
figure
into
any
calculus.
most
people
who
get
out
of
cars
are
not
convicted
felons
bearing
drugs.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
the
point
of
justice
stevens'
question
is
why
should
we
go
beyond...
strictly
why
should
we
go
beyond
the
generalization
in
belton?
and
the
reason
certainly
cannot
be
that
this
particular
guy
had
a
record
and
had
drugs.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
get
into...
into
deeper
water
if
you
say
that
because
the...
to
me
the
incoherence
of
belton
is
that
it...
it
purports
to
be
an
application
of
chimel
with
a
bright
line,
but
at
the
point
at
which
the
actual
search
is
made,
any
danger
to
the
officer
is
over.
and
so
if...
if
you're
going
to
try
to
justify
a...
a
more
flexible
approach
to
belton
on
grounds
of
the
safety
justification
in
belton,
i...
i
think
you're...
you're
out
over
your
head.
and...
and
the
force
of
justice
stevens'
question
to
me
is
this.
belton
is
not
coherent
with
chimel.
belton
does
not
stand
up
as
an
analysis
of
anything
other
than
we're
going
to
have
a
simple
bright
line
rule
for
cars
and
stop
all
of
this
litigation.
but
if
belton
gave
a
bright
line
rule
for
cars,
why
is
there
a
justification
for
making
it
less
bright
by
going
beyond
the
specific
kinds
of
facts
in
belton
itself?
that's
the
force
of
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is...
is
your
criterion
then
going
to
be
a
time
criterion,
the
recency
of
his
exit
from
the
car?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
time
or
is
it
space?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if...
if
i
get
out
of
my
car
and
i
run
as
fast
as
i
can
run
for
15
seconds,
and
i
get
across
the
parking
lot,
that
is
very
recent
in
time.
can...
can
you
search
my
car
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i
want
your
position.
we
want
a
bright
line
rule.
if...
if
i...
if
i'm
a
sprinter
and
i
get
across
the
parking
lot
and
it's
15
seconds,
can
they
search
the
car?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
bright
line
rules
are...
are
there
to...
to
avoid
marginal
problems.
what...
what's
the
answer
to
my...
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
he...
what
if
he
didn't
see
the
police
officer?
he
drives
into
the
parking
lot,
gets
out
of
his
car,
locks
the
car.
he's
5
feet
away
and...
and
the
police
say,
that's
the
guy
i
saw
speeding
on
main
street
10
minutes
ago.
what's...
what's
the
answer
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
he's...
he
is
in
the
spot
he
would
have
been
if
the
police
had
arrested
him
or
had
apprehended
him
in
the
car
and
told
him
to
get
out.
can
they
search?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
they
see
him...
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
they
see
him
get
out
of
the
car,
can
they
then
search
in
my
hypo?
