mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
government,
having
failed
to
prove
that
the
police
initiated
contact
with
petitioner
thornton
while
he
was
an
occupant
of
his
automobile
and
having
failed
to
prove
that
when
mr.
thornton
was
arrested,
that
he
was
even
within
reaching
distance
of
his
automobile,
may
rely
on
new
york
v.
belton
to
justify
a
warrantless,
suspicionless
search
of
mr.
thornton's
automobile
incident
to
arrest.
now,
it's
the
government's
burden--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--they
were
within
reaching
distance
of
the
vehicle,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
they...
they
were
standing
by
the
side
of
the
car
at
the...
at
the
moment
of
arrest.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
believe
that
when
you
focus
on
the
word
recent,
it's
not
a
very
bright
line
test
unless
you
flesh
it
out
and
give
it
some
definition.
i
believe
i
was
a
recent
occupant
of
my
automobile
this
morning.
somebody
could
say
i
was
recently
in
that,
but
that
wouldn't
mean
that
they
could
go
search
it.
well,
the
facts
show--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--a
lot
less...
the
facts
here
show
a
lot
less
time,
but
recent
doesn't
give
the
kind
of
clear
bright
line
that
belton
said
it
was
trying
to
draw
because
it...
it's
open
to
a
lot
of
interpretation.
our--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--no.
those...
those
are
the
facts
of
the
case,
your
honor.
but
moments
again...
is
he...
is
he
5
yards,
10
yards,
15
yards
away
from
the
vehicle?
we...
i
think
we
need
to
go
back
to
what
belton
was
all
about.
belton
said
that
it
concerns
the
proper...
quoting
at
page
459
of
the
belton
opinion,
it
says
the
proper
scope
of
a
search
of
the
interior
of
an
automobile,
incident
to
a
lawful
custodian...
custodial
arrest
of
its
occupants.
and
the
belton
rule
itself
says,
quote,
at
page
460,
when
a
policeman
has
made
a
lawful
arrest
of
the
occupants
of
an
automobile,
he
may,
as
a
contemporaneous
incident
of
that
arrest,
search
the
passenger
compartment
of
that
automobile.
belton
was
focusing
on
that
highly
dangerous
situation
when
a
police
officer
initiates
contact
with
and
approaches
a...
an
occupied
vehicle.
as
this
court
recognized
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms,
that
may
be
the
most
highly
dangerous
situation
an
officer
faces.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
so
was
mr.
thornton,
your
honor,
and
i--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--i
would
agree
with
that
100
percent,
your
honor,
but
the
converse
of
that
position
is
that
in
order
to
do
the
search,
the...
that
he's
allowed
to
do
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that...
that
right
to
search
fixes
at
the
moment
he
effects
the
custodial
arrest.
you
don't
want
to...
or
it's
not
reasonable
to
require
the
officer
to
conduct
that
search
with
the
suspect
at
his
elbow.
so
while
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
as
a...
as
a
very
practical
matter,
there
is
no
danger
to
the
officer
in
the
situation
where
the
man
is
arrested,
stuffed
in
the
back
of
the
squad
car,
and
then
we
go
search,
that's
kind
of
a
fiction.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
be
a
kind
of
a
reasonable
fiction
because
otherwise,
the
converse
is,
if
the
officer
is
going
to
search
the
car,
he's
got
to
do
it
with
mr.
thornton
or
mr.
belton
standing
right
beside
him.
and
that's
why--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--that's...
that's
right.
i...
and
i...
and
i
believe,
your
honor,
that's
why...
this
case
is
really
presenting
a
situation
where
we're
dealing
with
the
harm
to
the
fourth
amendment
instead
of
really
dealing
with
potential
danger
to
the
officer.
modern
police
practices
are
going
to
have
a
mr.
belton
or
a
mr.
thornton
in
the
back
of
the
squad
car
at
the
time
these
searches
incident
to
the
arrest
under
belton
or
whether
you're
operating--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
may
or
may
not--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--the...
that
ground,
that
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
was
not
advanced
by
the
government
below.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that's
correct.
we--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--we
have
not--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
the...
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
address--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--well,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
we're
not
conceding
that
particularly
in
this
case.
we're
not
saying
that
there...
this
case
involves
a
car
that
was
parked
in
a...
in
a
shopping
mall
parking
lot.
and
the
only
motor
vehicle
violation
didn't
authorize
a
towing
of
the
vehicle.
so
that
the...
the...
there
is
an
inadequate
record
below
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
there
would
have
been
an
inevitable
towing
and
inventory
of
this
car.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
you
could
make
the
same
argument
with
regard
to
the
house
in
chimel,
that
we
limit
the
search
to
the
area
within
reaching
distance
in
the
room
that
the
man
is
in.
we
don't
let
him
go
into
the
kitchen
or
the
bedroom.
but
there
could
be
accomplices
there.
there
could
be
guns
there.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
it...
the...
if
the...
the
justification
in
belton
for
allowing
the
vehicle
search
says
it's
not
a
departure
from
chimel,
and
it
limits
the
search
to
an
area
within
the
reaching
distance.
it's
based
on
a
generalization,
your
honor,
that
everything
within
the
narrow
passenger
compartment
of
the
vehicle
is
within
reach
of
an
occupant.
now,
when
a
man
is
no
longer
an
occupant
and
has
become
a
pedestrian
and
is
walking
on
the
street,
that
generalization
that
he
can
reach
everything
in
the
narrow
passenger
compartment
of
an
automobile
no
longer
makes
any
sense.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
your
honor,
belton
was
decided
absolutely
correctly
i
believe.
the...
the...
roger
belton
was
approached
by
the
officer
while
he
was
an
occupant
of
the
vehicle.
the
officer
asked
him
to
step
out
of
the
car.
i
do
not
believe
that
we
want
to
have
our
search
incident
to
arrest
doctrine
turn
on
whether
the
officer
decides
to
have
him
step
out
before
he
places
him
under
arrest
or
arrest
him,
sit
him
in
the...
sitting
in
the
vehicle.
five
other--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--in
my
view
he
would
not
be
able
to
do
a
belton
search.
he
would
be
able
to
a
chimel
search.
he'd
be
able
to
arrest
the
individual
under
chimel,
which
is
still
the...
the
law
in
this
court,
and
he
would
be
able
to
conduct
a
search
of
anything
within
mr.
thornton's
reaching
distance
at
the
time.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
if...
if
the...
if
the
car
was...
if
he
could...
he
could
search
for
anything
within
reaching
distance
of
the
person
he's
arresting.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
if
he
could
reach
into
the
car,
he
could...
he
could
get
anything
within
the
man's
reach.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
i...
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
he
hasn't
arrested
the
man
and
he
has
an
opportunity
to
let
the
man
move
away
from
the
car
before
he
conducts
the
arrest,
he's
certainly
acting
as
a
prudent
officer
in
protecting
his
own
safety.
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
man
who
exits
the
vehicle
and
runs
to
the
fence,
15,
20,
30
yards
from
the
vehicle,
whether
he
did
it
because
the
police
pulled
up
behind
him
and
turned
the
flashers
on
or
whether
the
policeman
surprised
him
as
he
was
coming
out
of
the
car,
neither
one
of
those
searches
are
good
under
belton
because
the
man...
it's...
it's
no
longer
appropriate
in
my
judgment
to
rely--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--i
understand.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
if
i
might
respond.
the...
our...
our
test
under
belton
has
two
prongs
to
it.
one
is
that
he's
in
the
car
when
the
police
initiate
contact
with
him.
the
second
is
that
he's
arrested
within
reaching
distance
of
the
car.
so
your
hypothetical
that
the
man
runs
to
the
fence--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--if
he's...
if
he's
outside
reaching
distance,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--well,
it's
the
moment--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--the
policeman
can
arrest
him
and
take
control
of
him.
so
i
would
argue
yes,
he
can
make
him
stay
within
reaching
distance.
the...
the
justification
for
the
belton
search
is
to
protect
the
officer.
it's
not
reasonable
to
think
that
he's
going
to
effect
his
arrest
at
a
point
that
increases
the
danger
to
himself
just
so
that
he
can
make
a
search.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
we...
that
is--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--no.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
our...
the
initiation
of
contact
we
believe
is
a...
is
a
very
reasonable
test,
and
we
believe
it's
called
for
by
the
belton
case
itself.
when
you
read...
when
you
read
belton,
it
says
it
is
a
narrow...
narrow...
class
of
problematic
recurring
cases,
and
then
it
gives
seven
cases
as
examples
of
cases
that
fall
within
its
class.
and
in
every
single
one
of
those
cases,
with
the
possible...
a
marginal
exception
of
one,
the
police
are
initiating
contact
with
the
man
while
he
is
an
occupant
of
a
vehicle.
we--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
if
you...
if
you
think
about
it,
that
most...
the
most
dangerous
situation
for
the
police
officer
is
when
he
initiates
contact
with
the
person
while
he's
an...
an
occupant
in
an...
of
an
automobile,
but
has
not
yet
gotten
up
to
the
point
where
he
can
get
him
out
and
make
an
arrest.
it's
during
that
interval
between
the
time
that
the
officer
initiates
contact
with
the
vehicle
and
the
time
when
he
actually
makes
a
custodial
arrest
that
the
danger
to
the
officer
is
at
its
greatest
point.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
because
in
most
cases,
your
honor,
the
officer
doesn't
have
a
choice.
you
look
at
the
case
in
new
york
v.
belton,
i
mean,
he...
the
officer
was
a...
was
a
state
trooper
pulling
the
man
over
on
the
highway.
the...
when...
when
you...
and
that's
going
to
be
the
case
most
of
the
time.
you're
going
to
have
a...
a
state
trooper
or
somebody
with
lights
on
top
of
their
car
that
are
pulling
somebody
over,
and
they
don't
really
have
a
choice.
or
you've
got
undercover
agents
watching
for
the
drug
transaction
to
occur
and
then
before
the
dealers
drive
off,
they
want
to
rush
the
car
and
make
the
arrest
of
the
occupants.
it...
the...
the
officer
frequently
has
no
choice.
and
i
like
to
think
of
it
as
when
you
turn
on
the
light
to
pull
the
man
over,
you
turn
on
belton.
belton
comes
on
when
you
turn
on
the
red
light
to
signal
the
man
over.
and
what
does
it
do
for
the
officer?
it
immediately
defines,
for
purposes
of
a
bright
line
rule,
who
is
an
occupant.
it
not
only
defines
who
is
an
occupant,
it
defines
who
can
become
a
recent
occupant.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
the...
the
court
has
come
close
to
entirely
extinguishing
any
fourth
amendment
protection
in
a
vehicle,
and
that
kind
of
a
decision
would
give
it
the
final
death
knell.
there
would
be
no
privacy
left.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
what
you
end
up
with,
your
honor,
is
when
you
combine
that
view
with
the
court's
decisions
in
atwater
and
wren,
you
end
up
with
the
police
stopping
somebody
in...
in
a
parking
lot,
maybe
a
short
distance
away
in
a
store
because
they've
got
a
dead
inspection
sticker.
but
it's
a
pretext
because
the
officer
wants
to
search
the
car.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
but
the...
the
court's
decisions
allow
the
arrest
to
be
made
on
a
minor
traffic
violation
that
doesn't
carry
anything
more
than
a
$200
fine
on
a
pretext
because
the
officer
wants
to
search
the
car.
he
then...
he
makes
the
arrest
on
the...
on
that
under...
under
wren
and
atwater.
he
then
has
the
right
to
go
search
the
entire
vehicle.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
the...
the
fact
is
that...
that
belton
is
an
arrest.
it
doesn't
require
a
towing
or
inventorying
of
the
car.
it
is
a...
a
classic
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
if
they're...
if
they
are
arrested,
justice
stevens.
many
times--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--people
are
just
issued
a
citation.
but
if
they're...
if
they're
stopped,
even
for
a
bad
traffic
signal
or
not
wearing
a
seat
belt,
they
can
be
subjected
to
a
custodial
arrest
and
have
their
entire
vehicle
searched.
and
i
think
that's
why
it's...
in
drawing
the
lines
here
with
respect
to
belton,
recognizing
that
the...
that
the
arrestee
is
usually
in
the
back
of
the
squad
car,
and
we're
not
here
talking
about
officer
safety
issues...
that
we
try
to
remain...
retain
some
semblance
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
regard
to
automobiles.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
mr.
thornton
was
placed
in
the
back
of
the
police
car
before
the
search
occurred,
your
honor.
he
was
arrested--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--arrested,
but
before
the
search,
your
honor.
and
that's
justice
ginsburg's
point.
where
is
the
danger
to
the
officer
when
the
arrestee
is
in
the
back
of
the
squad
car?
and
that
is
a
fiction
and
it
is
a
fiction
that
courts
accept,
that
if
the
squad
car
drives
off
with
the
man
and
takes
him
back
to
the
station
house,
then
the
right
to
search
is
gone,
but
as
long
as
it's
a
contemporaneous
part
of
an
unfolding
scene--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--i...
i
assume
most
good
police
departments
do,
but
in
this--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
those
inventory
concerns
were...
were
not
addressed
in...
in
the
factual
record.
we
believe
we
would
win
on
the
issue
of
inevitable
discovery.
the
fourth
circuit
didn't
address
it.
and
moreover,
you...
frequently
you're
going
to
have
an
occupant
arrested
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
vehicle
is
going
to
get
towed.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
i...
i
was
just
going
to
finish,
your
honor,
by
saying
that
the...
that...
that
you
might
just
arrest
one
occupant
and
you
might
let
the
other
occupants
go
on.
so
you
can't
necessarily
say
that
the
vehicle
is
always
going
to
be
towed
and
is
always
going
to
be
inventoried.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
as
long
as
they're...
they're
more
definite
than
words
like
recent
or
close
proximity--
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
--and
i...
that's
what
i
thought
the
court
did
in
belton
was
give
examples.
and
if
you
follow
the
examples
that
were
given
in
belton,
you
don't
approve
the
search
that
occurred
with
regard
to
mr.
thornton,
because
if
you're
trying
to
draw
a
bright
line,
which
is
what
you
were
trying
to
do
in
belton,
you
have...
some
things
fall
on
one
side
of
that
line
and
some
things
fall
on
the
other.
and
we
would...
we
would
submit
that
once
a
person,
on
his
own
without
any
prompting
from
the
police,
becomes
a
pedestrian,
he's
no
longer
an
occupant
of
a
vehicle.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
moments.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
well,
the...
it
seems
like
the
entire
time
i've
been
standing
here
is
moments
because
my
life
is
going
in
front
of
my
eyes.
[laughter]
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
but
in...
in
any
event,
we
would
argue
that
the...
that
the
search
here
was
outside
of
belton
and
we
would
also
argue
that
you
have
a
perfectly
good
35-year-old
precedent
in
chimel.
if
belton
doesn't
apply
and
you're
on
the
other
side
of
the
belton
line,
then
you
go
to
chimel,
and
chimel
tells
you
what
to
do.
chimel
wasn't
limited
to
houses.
it
is
the
rule
that
the
police
use
every
single
day
when
they
effect
a
custodial
arrest.
no
new
rules.
no
new
guidance.
just
if
belton
doesn't
apply,
go
to
chimel.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
please.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
i
have
four
brief
points,
your
honor,
that
i'd
like
to
make,
if
i
could.
the
first
is
that
the
state
court
opinion
in
michigan
v.
long,
people
v....
people
v.
long,
shows
that
the
car
there
was
being
chased
by
the
police.
they
just
weren't
observing
him
drive
by
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
and
crash
into
a
ditch.
they
were
in
a
high-speed
chase,
and
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
they
had
their
lights
on
and
therefore
had
initiated
contact.
furthermore,
the
state
court
opinion
in
people
v.
long
shows
that
long
was
in
the
vehicle
when
the
officers
got
out
of
their
car,
after
he
had
crashed
into
the
ditch,
and
began
to
approach
the
vehicle.
then
long
exited
his
vehicle
and
walked
towards
the
officers.
so
i
don't
think
it's...
it's
fair
to
say
that
there
was
no
initiation
of
contact
by
the
officers
with
long
in
the
long
case
and
that
the
footnote
in
the
long
opinion
referencing
to
belton
is
no
expansion
or
further
brightening
of
the
belton
rule.
second,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
frick
case,
which
is
the
one
possible
exception
that
i
think
justice
stevens
referred
to
when
he
was
talking
about
the
cases
that
belton
points
to
as
defining
its
class...
the
man
is
either
getting
into
or
getting
out
of
his
vehicle.
he
has
not...
he
has
not
achieved
the
status
of
pedestrian.
most
people...
i
think
you
could
still
consider
someone
who
was
in
the
act
of
either
getting
in
or
getting
out...
you
could
call
that
person
an
occupant.
third,
if
you...
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
adopt
mr.
garre's
place
where
he
would
have
occupied
if
he
had
been
arrested
test.
we
call...
that's
the
government's
might
have
test.
but
mr.
garre
would
add
that
to
what
the
fourth
circuit
rule
and
would
have
him...
and...
and
would
add
a
limit
that,
oh,
as
long
as
he's
arrested
where
he
might
have
been
if
he
might
have
been
arrested,
if
we'd
stopped
him
when
he
was
getting
out
of
his
car.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
an
unworkable
rule
and
it
just
adds
further
confusion
to
the
situation.
yet,
it's
necessary,
necessary
because
it's
the
only
way
you
avoid
reversing
chimel.
now,
the...
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
justice
o'connor
i
think
made
a
good
point
about
the
inventory
search.
why
can't
we
draw
belton
narrowly
because
in
90
percent
of
the
cases,
we're
going
to
have
an
inventory
search
anyway?
and
why
can't
we
maintain
some
semblance
of
fourth
amendment
protection
in
automobiles?
and
finally,
with
regard
to
the
handcuffs
point,
mr.
garre's
point
that
people
sometimes
get
out
of
their
handcuffs,
i'd
simply
like
to
say
if
we
indulge
in
the
presumption
that
suspects
are
going
to
get
out
of
their
handcuffs,
there's
simply
no
search
incident
to
arrest
rule
that
we
can
fashion
that
doesn't
just
have
us
searching
everyplace
on
god's
green
earth.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
yes.
mr.
frank
w.
dunham,
jr.
i
believe
an
inventory
search
does
not
allow
you
to
search
opaque
containers
within
the
car.
