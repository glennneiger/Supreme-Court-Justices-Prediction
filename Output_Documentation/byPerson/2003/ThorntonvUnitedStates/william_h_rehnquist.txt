03-5165,
thornton
against
united
states.
here
a
norfolk
virginia
a
police
officer
attempted
to
pull
over
petitioner,
a
guy
name
marcus
thornton.
before
the
officer
could
stop
petitioner
however,
he
parked
and
exited
his
vehicle.
the
officer
pulled
in
behind
petitioner
and
accosted
him.
after
discovering
that
he
had
narcotics
on
him,
the
officer
arrested
him
and
searched
the
passenger
compartment
of
his
car.
under
the
driver’s
seat,
the
officer
has
found
a
handgun.
petitioner
was
charged
with
federal
drug
and
firearms
violation.
the
district
court
denied
his
motion
to
suppress
the
firearm
as
a
fruit
of
an
illegal
search
relying
among
other
cases
on
our
opinion
in
new
york
against
belton.
in
belton,
we
held
that
when
a
police
officer
makes
a
lawful
custodial
arrest
of
an
automobile’s
occupant,
the
fourth
amendment
allows
the
officer
to
search
the
vehicle’s
passenger
compartment
as
a
contemporaneous
incident
to
that
arrest.
the
petitioner
appealed
his
conviction
arguing
that
bellton
was
limited
to
situations
where
the
officer
initiated
contact
with
an
arrestee
while
the
arrestee,
in
this
case
petitioner,
was
still
in
the
car.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm.
in
belton,
we
sought
to
set
forth
a
bright-line
rule
that
would
protect
officer’s
safety
and
preserve
evidence
for
trial.
we
place
no
reliance
on
whether
the
officer
initiated
the
contact
with
the
occupant
of
the
vehicle.
in
all
relevant
aspects,
the
arrest
of
a
suspect
who
is
next
to
a
vehicle
presents
identical
concerns
regarding
officer’s
safety
and
the
destruction
of
evidence
as
the
arrest
of
one
who
is
still
inside
the
vehicle.
it
would
make
little
sense
to
apply
two
different
rules
to
what
is
at
bottom
the
same
situation.
we
disagree
with
the
petitioner
that
applying
belton’s
rule
to
arrestees
who
are
not
confronted
while
they
were
inside
the
vehicle
would
diminish
its
clarity.
belton
explicitly
applied
to
recent
occupants
of
a
car
as
well
as
occupant.
a
rule
requiring
officers
to
signal
confrontation
with
occupants
of
vehicles
would
be
inherently
subjective,
highly
facts-specific,
and
would
require
precisely
the
sort
of
ad
hoc
determinations
of
the
officers
in
the
field
and
of
reviewing
courts
that
belton
sought
to
avoid.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
affirmed.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
disssenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
