we'll
hear
argument
now
in
02-1794,
the
united
states
v.
manuel
flores-montano.
ms.
blatt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
gas
tank
here
had
80
pounds
in
it,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
any
of
the
other
circuits
followed
the
ninth
circuit's...
other
circuits
have
that...
which
have
land
borders?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
hubachek.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr....
mr.
hubachek,
montoya
discussed
that
in
the
context
of
a
search
of
the
person.
it...
it
said
we
reserve
judgment
on
whether
a
strip
search
of
his
body...
it
was
talking
about
people,
not
gas
tanks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hubachek,
now
you
say,
you
give
the
impression
that
all
courts
of
appeals
have
agreed
with
the
ninth
circuit.
ms.
blatt
gave
the
impression,
at
least
to
me,
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
alone
on
this.
what
is
the
state
of
decisions,
say
in
the
fifth
circuit,
which
has
so
much
land
border
like
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how...
how
often
does
that
happen
that
an
innocent
person
has
his
gas
tank
person
random...
randomly
disassembled?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in...
in
your
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
a
few
minutes
ago,
you
said
that
not
only
was
the
property
interest
important,
but
the
inconvenience
was
a...
was
a
factor,
and
i
don't
know
that
we've
ever
said
much
about
that
that
would...
would
support
it.
certainly
there's
going
to
be
some
inconvenience
any
time
you
cross
a
border,
and
this
thing,
if
it
takes
half
an
hour,
is
that
really
a
fourth
amendment
factor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
delaware
against
prouse
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
border.
i
mean,
that
was
on
a
highway...
inland
highway
in
delaware.
the
fourth
amendment
has
always
been
much
relaxed
at
the
border.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
you
just
can't
transplant
a
case
involving
a
car
on
a
highway
inland
to
the
border.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hubachek.
ms.
blatt,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
02-1794,
united
states
versus
flores-montano.
when
respondent,
manuel
flores
montano
attempted
to
enter
the
united
states
at
the
otay
mesa
port
of
entry
in
southern
california,
customs
officials
seized
81
pounds
of
marihuana
from
the
gas
tank
of
the
station
wagon.
the
search
involved
the
removal
and
disassembly
of
the
gas
tank
via
mechanic
under
contract
with
the
customs.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
forbade
the
fuel
tank
search
absent
reasonable
suspicion.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
time,
and
again,
we
have
stated
that
searches
made
at
the
boarder
pursuant
to
the
longstanding
right
of
the
sovereign
to
protect
itself
by
stopping
and
examining
persons
and
property
crossing
into
this
country
are
reasonable
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
occur
at
the
boarder.
congress,
since
the
beginning
of
our
government,
has
granted
the
executive
plannery
authority
to
conduct
routine
searches
and
seizures
at
the
boarder
without
probable
cause
or
a
warrant
in
order
to
regulate
the
collection
of
duties
and
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
contraband
into
this
country.
it
is
axiomatic
that
the
united
states,
as
sovereign,
has
the
inherent
authority
to
protect
and
a
paramount
interest
in
protecting
its
national
integrity.
that
interest
in
protecting
the
boarders
as
illustrated
in
this
case
by
the
evidence
that
smugglers
frequently
attempt
to
penetrate
our
boarders
with
contraband
secreted
in
their
automobiles
fuel
tank.
respondent
urges
that
he
has
a
privacy
interest
in
his
fuel
tank
and
that
the
suspicionless
disassembly
of
his
tank
is
an
invasion
of
his
privacy.
but
on
many
occasions,
we
have
noted
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
less
at
the
boarder
than
it
is
in
the
interior,
and
we
have
long
recognized
that
automobiles
seeking
entry
into
this
country
may
be
searched.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
the
search
of
a
gas
tank
which
should
be
solely
a
repository
for
fuel
could
be
more
of
an
invasion
of
privacy
than
the
search
of
the
automobile’s
passenger
compartment.
respondent
also
argues
that
the
disassembly
and
reassembly
of
his
gas
tank
is
a
significant
depravation
of
his
property
interest
because
it
may
damage
the
vehicle.
he
does
not,
and
on
this
record,
cannot
truly
contend
that
the
procedure
of
removal,
disassembly,
and
reassembly
of
the
fuel
tank
in
this
case
or
any
other
has
resulted
in
serious
damage
to
the
property.
a
gas
tank
search
involves
a
brief
procedure
that
can
be
reversed
without
damaging
the
safety
or
operation
of
the
vehicle,
and
any
interference
with
a
motorist's
possessory
interest
is
justified
by
the
government’s
paramount
interest
in
protecting
the
boarder.
for
these
reasons,
we
hold
that
the
government’s
authority
to
conduct
suspicionless
inspections
at
the
boarder
includes
the
authority
to
remove,
disassemble,
and
reassemble
a
vehicle’s
fuel
tank.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
