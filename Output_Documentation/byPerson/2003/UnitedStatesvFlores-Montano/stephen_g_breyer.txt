justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
make
us,
i.e.,
i'm
not
saying
this
pejoratively,
but
can
this
court
be
required
to
decide
what
might
be
a
hypothetical
question,
it
seems
to
me,
the
dog
barked
and
therefore
they
had
grounds
for
thinking
their
were
drugs
in
the
gas
tank,
and
he
kicked
the
gas
tank
and
it
was
hollow,
and
no
one
disputes
those
facts.
but
you
want
to
decide...
us
to
decide
this
case,
as
does
the
other
side,
as
if
those
facts
didn't
exist.
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
hypothetical
question,
almost
in
the
direction
of
an
advisory
opinion.
what
would
we
have
decided
if
those
facts
didn't
exist?
but
they
do.
so
how
does
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
is
a...
i
wasn't
doubting
the
government's
motive
here.
i
think
you
have
excellent
motive,
though
maybe
bivens,
maybe
it
was
a
little
overconcerned
about
the
bivens,
maybe
it
wasn't.
but
what
i'm
interested
in
is
the
law.
that
is,
this
isn't
the
first
case
where
this
has
happened,
not
necessarily
involving
the
government,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
the
law's
supposed
to
work.
parties
come
in
and
they
say,
we
would
like
you
to
decide
this
issue.
i'm
sure
they
would.
but
in
order
to
get
to
that
issue,
we
have
to
assume
out
of
the
case
certain
facts
that
everyone
agrees
are
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
ever
looked
this
up?
are
there
any...
have
you
come
across
this
kind
of
a
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
all
there
is,
is
there
happens
to
be,
i
think,
in
the
record,
undisputed
facts
that
the
dog
barked
and
that
they
kicked
the
gas
tank
and
it
was
hollow.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--anyway--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
full,
whatever,
whatever,
whatever--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
showed...
showed
whatever
it
wasn't
supposed
to
show.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
don't
know
of
the
8,000
what
percent
were
without
any
suspicion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah,
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
there
any
rules
or
administrative
procedures
in
the
customs
that
would
say...
that
would
apply
in
respect
to
suspicionless
searches
of
gas
tanks?
for
example,
random
searches,
do
it
once
a
month
or
here's...
we
have
a
random
program
or
we
check
up
to
see
how
it's
going
or...
are
there...
are...
is
it
just
each
customs
agent
for
himself
when...
if
you
win,
is
it
each
customs
agent
for
himself
with
no
check
whatsoever?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
are
there
internal
administrative
checks
that
would
be
a
kind
of
substitute
for
a
judicial
check?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
does
it
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
for
example,
you
have
a
customs
agent
whose
experience
leads
him
to
believe
that
parents
with
small
children
are
more
likely
to
be
smuggling
heroin.
now,
this
would
be
an
odd
customs
agent.
is
there
anything
in
the
system
that
would
discover
that
this
is
the
person
who's
doing
all
the
suspicionless
checks
and
something's
gone
wrong
here,
so
there's...
do
you
see
what
i'm
looking
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
looking
for
some
way
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
then
you
have
the
suspicion
searches
in
that
85
percent.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
if
we
have
each
customs
agent
for
himself
to
conduct
whatever
suspicionless
searches
he
wants,
and
you
have
a
few
of
the,
perhaps
in
every
organization
there
are
a
few
unusual
ones
who
cause
some
problems,
are
there
any
internal
checks
within
the
system,
because
you're
going
to
not
have
a
judicial
check?
i
wonder
if
there
are
any
administrative
ways.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that...
is
that
the
only
kind
of...
i
mean,
i
take
it
you
concede
there's
no
privacy
interest
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
so
there's
no
privacy
interest
and
all
there
is
is
an
interest
that
you
don't
want
the
government
hurting
your
property,
which
is
conceivable
in
an
interest.
but
on
the
other
hand,
they
say
no
privacy
interest,
conceivable
the
government
will
hurt
your
property.
every
day
of
the
week
we
deal
with
government
people
might
hurt
our
property.
and
on
the
other
side,
25
percent
of
all
the
drugs
that
come
into
the
united
states
outside...
by
land,
come
in
in
gas
tanks,
so
this
is
an
overwhelming
interest
for
letting
you
do
it.
after
all,
they
search
your
suitcases,
they
search
my
pockets,
they
search
every
piece
of
luggage,
they...
they
search
anything
you're
bringing
in,
and
it's
not
an
unusual
thing
at
a
border.
so...
so,
how...
how
do
you
respond
to
this
strong
interest
on
their
side
and
no
privacy
interest
and
very
little
property
damage
risk
on
the
other
side?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it's
the
same
as
a...
suppose
there's
a
terrorism
problem
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
say
that
we
want
to
search
every
fifteenth
truck
that
comes
in,
there
might
be
anthrax
or
bombs
or
whatever
and
we
want
to
give
the
agents
the
power
to
look
thoroughly
into
these
big
trucks
even
without
suspicion.
now
were
you
saying
the
fourth
amendment
would
stop
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
non-specific
threat,
it's
the
present
situation.
the
government
simply
says,
we're
worried
about
our
borders,
they're
not
secure,
and
we
want
to
look
at
the
trucks,
that
we
want
the...
the
customs
agents
to
be
able
to
look
at
trucks
that
are
coming
in.
they
may
have
dangerous
items
on...
in...
on
board,
and
we
want
them
to
look
whenever
they
want.
it's
at
the
border,
just
like
your
purse,
just
like
your
valise,
just
like
your
bag.
now,
what...
what's
your
view
of...
is
your
case
the
same,
different,
or
what
do
you
think
of
that
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
in
your
view,
suspicionless
searches
of
trucks,
whether
for
bombs,
anthrax,
weapons,
or
drugs
all
stand
or
fall
together?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different
question.
my
question
was,
do
they
stand
or
fall
together?
