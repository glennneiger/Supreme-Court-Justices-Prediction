ms....
ms.
blatt,
may
i
just
go
back
before
you
go
on
with
your
argument
to
follow
up
on
justice
stevens'
question?
you
spoke
of
the
$50,000
limit
as
being
for
damage
or,
i
guess,
destruction
of
non-commercial
property.
does...
does
the
non-commercial
mean,
as
i
would
assume
it
would
mean,
that
a
truck
or
lorry
that
is
driven
as
a...
as
a
carrier
would
not
be
covered,
damage
to
that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
$50,000
coverage?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
the...
if
the...
if
the
truck,
i
mean,
if
the
commercial
truck
catches
fire
as
a
result
because
there's
a
spark
in
the
gas
tank
and
everything
goes
up
in
flames,
in
effect
there's
no
redress?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
customs
isn't
going
to
pay
for
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
you
would
also--
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
reason--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
isn't
the
point
that
in...
in
the...
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
puts,
with
the
probable
cause,
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
the
offices
are
in
there
acting
reasonably.
the
question
in
this
case
is
posed
by
justice
stevens'
question.
would
the
potential
for
damage...
is
it
reasonable
to
go
in
there
in
the
first
place
without
probable
cause?
so
that
is
a
different
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
it
the...
you...
you
described
the
search
as
intrusive,
but
as
i
understand
it,
your
objection
is
not
to
the
intrusion,
your
objection
is
to
the
disassembly.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
the...
the...
i...
i
assume
your
objection
rests
on
either
or
both
of
these
grounds,
either
the
value
of
the
property,
which
is
either
lessened
or
placed
at
risk,
or
the
inconvenience
to
the
driver
and
passenger
while
the...
while
the
intrusion
or
the
disassembly
goes
on.
which
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
you
know,
what
is
the
issue
on
value?
they'll
put
it
back
together
again,
there's
apparently
no
record
that...
that
these
blow
up
all
the
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
what
is
the...
the
property
concern?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
there
any?
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
think
i...
i...
i
lost
what
you
were
saying
when
you
started
referring
to
the
gizmo.
if...
if
i
bring
in...
if
i
buy
a
valuable
statue
in
europe
and
i
have
it
elaborately
crated
so
it
won't
be
hurt
in
transport,
when
it
gets
to
new
york,
can
they
open
the
crate
to
see
what's
inside?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
so
the
difference
between
the
crate
and
the
gas
tank
is,
i
take
it,
your
concern
that
after
they've
put
the
gas
tank
back
together,
there
may
be
some
risk
that
it
won't
function
or
that
the
emissions
system
will
be
affected?
i
mean,
is
that
where
you
draw
the
line
between
the
crate
and
the
tank?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but,
i
mean,
we...
we
didn't
have
this
problem
in
1790
or
1799,
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
difference
in
principle
for
constitutional
purposes
between
opening
up,
disassembling
my
crate,
and
disassembling
the
gas
tank?
and
the
only
thing
that
i
can
think
of
is,
based
on
what
you've
said
so
far,
is
the
concern
that
maybe
the
gas
tank
won't
work
or
i'll
have
to
disclose
it
to
a
subsequent
purchaser,
or
the
emissions
system
will
be
hurt.
do
you
have
anything
else
to
distinguish
in
principle
between
the...
the
uncrating
and
the
opening
of
the
tank?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
security
is...
is
the...
is
the
concern
that
maybe
the
tank
won't
work
or...
or
are
you
saying
maybe...
maybe
the...
it'll
blow
up?
is
that
what
you
mean
by
the
security?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
well,
the
individual,
i
assume,
is
not
in
the
car
when
they
take
the
tank
out,
so
we're
talking
simply
about
property
damage.
when
they
uncrate
the
statue,
they
might
knock
the
hand
off,
but
they
can
still
uncrate
the
statue.
what...
anything
else
in
principle
between
the
two
situations?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
depends
on
my
intention?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
intend
the
crate
to
be
opened,
but
when
i
buy
a
gas
tank
i
don't
intend
it
to
be
opened?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
the
expectation
of
privacy
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
this
is
a
new
test,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
distinction
between
the
two
cases,
i
take
it,
now
is
the
intent
of
the
owner
of
the
property
that
is
disassembled.
in
the
one
case,
the
owner
ultimately
intends
the
crate
to
be
opened
up.
in
the
other
case,
he
does
not
intend
the
gas
tank
to
be
opened
up.
is,
is
that
it?
