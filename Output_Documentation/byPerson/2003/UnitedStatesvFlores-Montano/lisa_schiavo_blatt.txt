ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
customs
officials
have
the
responsibility
to
protect
the
nation's
borders
against
the
entry
of
dangerous
or
unwanted
items.
consistent
with
that
fundamental
and
sovereign
necessity,
customs
officials
have
historically
had
the
power
to
open
containers
and
conduct
a
thorough
search
of
items
without
a
warrant,
probable
cause,
or
any
particularized
suspicion.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct,
but
we
did
not
rely
on
it
and
the
evidence
was
suppressed
on...
based
on
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
that
a
gas
tank
cannot
be
removed
and
opened
without
reasonable
suspicion.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
i
don't
think
it's
an
advisory
opinion
in
that
the
evidence
has
been
suppressed.
but,
justice
breyer,
let
me
directly
answer
your
question
on
why
the
case
is
here.
in
2002,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
constitution
is
violated
if
customs
officials
remove
and
open
a
gas
tank
without
reasonable
suspicion,
and
in
that
case
there
was
reasonable
suspicion,
making
the
case
very
difficult
to
challenge.
the
government
legitimately
wanted
to
challenge
the
case
in
a...
in
a...
in
a
case
where
the
officers
actions
could
not
be
subject
to
a
potential
bivens
liability
for
violating
the
clearly
established
law
of
the
ninth
circuit.
at
the
same
time,
customs
officials
viewed
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
as
posing
an
immediate
and
present
danger
to
their
ability
to
protect
the
border,
and
they
thought
it
imperative
to
try
to
challenge
a...
bring
up
a
case
that
challenged
that
rule
as
soon
as
possible.
so
two
weeks
after
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
was
decided,
respondent
drove
across...
drove
across
the
border
with
a
gas
tank
full
of
80
pounds
of
marijuana,
and
the
government,
we
think
legitimately,
told
the
district
court,
and
there
was
no
secret
at
any
time
in
this
case,
including
at
the
petition
stage,
that
we
were
not
going
to
put
on
evidence
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion,
even
though
the
dog
alerting
and
the
solid-sounding
tap
of
the
gas
tank,
we
could
have
established
or
presumably
could
have
established
that
that
was
reasonable
suspicion.
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
summarily
affirmed
the...
suppressed
it
and
then
affirmed
the
suppression,
because
there
was
not
reasonable
suspicion,
and
that's
why
this
case
is
here.
the
customs
officials
see
this
case
as
a
threat
to
their
ability
to
deter
and
detect
smuggling
at
a
container
that
is
relatively
large
and
that
is
commonly
used...
in
fact,
it
is
the
most
common
container
used
along
the
mexican
border--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--to
conceal
contraband.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
but
we
didn't
want
to
have
to
tell
the
men
and
women
who
were
in
charge
of
enforcing
the
border
that
they
should
be
subject
to
a
potential
suit,
at
least
being
named
in
their
personal
capacity
in
a
lawsuit.
it
seemed
more
appropriate
from
our
perspective
to
try
to
bring
a
case
as
soon
as
possible
where
we
think
we
could
have
proven
reasonable
suspicion,
but
it
squarely
fit
within
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
that
reasonable
suspicion
was
required.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it...
it
helps
to
explain
why
we
thought
there
was
a
paramount
interest
in
getting
the
case
as
soon
as
possible.
we
didn't
want
to
divert
resources
away
from
the
border
into
having
to
prove
our
reasonable
suspicion.
in
fact,
there's
already
been
serious
fallout
in
terms
of
trying
to
prove
reasonable
suspicion
when
we
search
gas
tanks,
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that
all
of
our
discovery
on
how
we
train
our
dogs
has
to
be
produced,
and
this
is
extremely
sensitive
information.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
it's...
it's
clearly
an...
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
it's
not
an
article
3
problem.
let
me
say,
justice
breyer,
there's
no
finding
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion,
nor
do
we
put
on
any
evidence
that
would
have
permitted
that.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
it
was--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right.
but
let
me
just
say
as
a--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--as
a
prudential
matter--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
there's
no--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--there's
no
finding,
justice
scalia.
it
is
our
position
that
we
could
have
put
on
proof
that
this
constituted
reasonable
suspicion
by
putting
the
dog's
handler
on
and
the
agent
explaining
what
a...
what
a
solid-sounding
tap
means.
we
didn't
do
that,
so
there's
no
finding,
but
let
me
just
say--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
at
least
that
the
defense
is
titled
to
discovery
on
that
so
that
the...
the
handler.
but
let
me
just
say,
justice
breyer,
as
a
prudential
matter,
i
think
that
that
is
a
legitimate
concern
at
the
petition
stage
when
we
petitioned,
and
there
was
no
secret
that
we
intentionally
brought
this
case
for
the
purpose
of
having
it
reviewed.
but
the
case
has
been
briefed,
there's
no
question
about
standing,
and
we
think
it's
appropriate
to
reach
the
issue.
twenty-five
percent
of
all
drug
seizures
along
the
mexican
border
are
hidden
in
gas
tanks,
that
we've
not
only
found
marijuana,
cocain,
heroin,
currency,
methamphetamine,
there
have
weapons
and
ammunition--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
it
might
matter,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
matter
where
the...
the
compartment
or
container
in
question
is
designed
to
be
removed
and
put
back
together
by
mechanics.
a
gas
tank
removal
is
something
that
can
be
done
within
a
reasonable
time
and
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
in
this
case,
once
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
in
this
case
it
took
under
a
half
an
hour,
but,
justice
o'connor,
i
want
to
stress
that
in
other
cases,
depending
on
the
type
of
car,
it
might
take
an
hour
or
two
hours,
and
the
last
thing
we
want
is
our
customs
official
to
be
on
a
fourth
amendment
stopwatch
and
telling
the
mechanic
to
rush.
so
they
need--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
it's
20--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--twenty-five
percent
of
narcotics
seizures
in
terms
of
amount
of
seizures
along
land
borders.
that
doesn't
include
seaports--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--in
terms
of
number
of
seizures.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
how
much
volume,
but
it's
a
lot,
given
that
the
gas
tank
is
one
of
the
largest
containers.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
that's
correct,
but--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--eighty
pounds
of
marijuana
with
five
gallons
of
gas,
and
that's
an
enormous
amount,
and
this
could
have
been
another...
another...
other
dangerous
items,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
just
marijuana.
and
they
have
seen
it
all.
at
the
same
time,
someone
does
not
store
personal
effects
in
their
gas
tank.
it's
just
a
repository
for
fuel.
and
this
involved
far
less
of
an
intrusion
on
privacy
interest
than
the
type
of
searches
that
can
happen
and
do
happen
at
the
border,
such
as
the
traveler's
baggage
and
the
passenger
compartments
in
the
vehicle.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
any
time
there's
damage
to
any
types
of
property
at
the
border,
the
person
is
handed
a
claims
form,
which
is
processed
through
customs,
first
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
now,
there's
an
exemption
for
claims
arising
out
of
the
tension
of
properties
by
customs
under
28
u.s.c.
2680(c),
but
assuming
that
happens,
customs
can
pay,
and
does
pay,
up
to
$1,000
under
the
small
claims
act,
under
31
u.s.c.
3723.
and
justice
stevens,
there's
another
statute,
a
customs-specific
statute,
19
u.s.c.
1630,
that
would
permit
customs
to
pay
up
to
$50,000,
but
the
restriction
is
for...
it
has
to
be
for
non-commercial
properties,
so
that
would
be
personal
property
that
customs
damage.
so
there's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
this
doesn't
involve
claim
of
damage
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
sure,
a
gas
tank
is
about
$100,
$200
item,
and
it's
conceivable
that
any
search
can
result
in
damage.
now,
respondent
has
never
claimed--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
you're
right.
you
could
have...
you
could
have--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right.
you
would...
no,
the
item
itself
probably
costs
under
$200,
but
you
would
have
labor
costs.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
depending
on
the
car,
the
ones
i've
seen
have
been
under
$200,
but
you
would
have
associated
labor
costs
and
maybe
other
parts.
but
the
basic
point
is
that
this
is
a
container,
it's
a
paradigmatic
type
of
item
that
can
be
opened
by
the...
at
the
border
without
any
particularized
suspicion.
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right.
and
property
is--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
i
don't
know
too
many
commercial
importers
that
don't
have
insurance
that
would
cover
damage
by
customs,
but
the
important
thing
is--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--customs
is
not
going
to
pay
for
that.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
but--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--excuse
me?
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
that...
that's
absolutely
true,
but--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it
would
depend.
as
long...
assuming
they're
acting
reasonably
in
carrying
out
the
search,
it's
still
reasonable
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there
have
been
thousands
of
disassemblies
at
the
border--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
no,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
search
property
at
the
border
by
virtue
of
the
fact
it's
at
the
border,
and
given
the
government's
overriding
interest
and
the
person's
reduced
expectations.
but
justice
souter,
there
has
been
no
known
or
reported
instance
of
this
hypothetical
risk
materializing
at
the
border
with
respect
to
a
customs
search.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
all
gas
tank
seizures,
which
there
have
been
thousands,
have
to
be
done
by
removal
and
disassembly
of
the
tank.
there
are,
you
could
call
them
searches,
because
that's
what
they
are,
of
gas
tanks
that
don't
involve
removal
and
disassembly,
if
you
use
sophisticated
equipment
such
as
density
busters
and
x-rays.
but
all
these
seizures
that
are
occurring
at
the
border,
in
order
to
get
to
the
drugs,
you
have
to
unscrew
the
bolts
that
are
holding
the
tank
to
the
undercarriage
of
the
vehicle
and
remove
the
tank
and
open
it
up.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
they
have
dogs
at
all
the
major
ports
of
entry,
but
the
dogs
don't
always
alert,
so
i
wouldn't
say
it's
necessarily
skipping,
but
the
dog
may
not
alert.
they
also
at
some
of
the
facilities
have
what
are
known
as
fiber
optic
scopes,
which
are
extremely
sophisticated
and
effective
equipment.
unfortunately,
75
percent
or
higher
of
all
tanks
have,
in
the
filler
tube,
have
an
anti-siphoning
valve
that
blocks
the
entry
of
the
scope
into
the
tank,
but
they
will
try
that
if
they
have
it.
it's
not
always
available.
it's
an
extremely
expensive
piece
of
equipment.
it
costs
$160,000
per
unit.
but
if
they
have
that,
presumably
they
try
that
first,
and
if
it's
blocked,
then
they
put
the
car
up
on
a
lift
and
unscrew
the
metal
bolts
that
are
holding
them
that...
to
the
metal
straps
that
are
holding
the
tank
and
they'll
remove
the
tank.
and
then
from
there
on
it's
pretty
straightforward
on
how
to
open
up
the
tank.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yeah,
that's
right.
our
position
is
where
the
procedure
imposes
only
a
modest
intrusion
on
interests
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
the
officers
don't
have
to
exhaust
every
least
intrusive
method.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's...
it's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--not
very
many,
justice
o'connor.
let
me
give
you
these
statistics.
there
have
been
120
million
vehicles
that
passed
through
this
country's
borders
last
year,
and
over
the
last
four
years,
four
years,
there
have
been
8,000
gas
tank
disassemblies.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
exactly
the
same.
it
has
always
been
the
rule
up
until
the
ninth
circuit
that
we
could
take
apart
a
gas
tank
without
reasonable
suspicion.
customs
officials--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
no,
they've
always
been
able
to
take
apart
a
gas
tank
on
something
less
than
reasonable
suspicion.
but
justice
o'connor,
it
is
true
that
as
a
practical
matter
customs
does
not
take
the
time
or
energy
to
take...
to
call
the
mechanic,
pay
for
the
mechanic
to
take
apart
the
gas
tank
unless
their
suspicions
are
focused
on
the
gas
tank,
and
it
will
usually
be
because
of
the
dog
alerts,
or
the
more
common
situation
is
it...
that
they're
just
not
sure
whether
that
gas
tank
has
been
altered.
maybe
a
bolt
looks
different
from
another
bolt
or
it
looks
like
it's
been
unscrewed,
and
it
may
be
the
person
had
their
gas
tank
worked
on,
but
they're
just
not
sure,
they
have
some
concern
about
the
person's
travel
plan
story
and
so
they...
they
want
to
go
ahead
and
make
sure
the
gas
tank's
not
containing
contraband.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
they
keep
statistics
on
seizures
on
narcotics
and
what
are
known
as
positive
and
negative
seizures.
and
in
the
last
four
years
of
the
8,000
gas
tank
seizures
that
have
happened,
85
to
90
percent
of
those
have
been
what
are
known
as
positive
hits
or
there's
been
a
presence
of
contraband,
and
so
10
to
15
percent
of
those
have
been
so-called
negative
searches
where
the
tank
is
reassembled
and
the
motorist
sent
on
their
way,
and
i...
we
would
expect
that
those
statistics
to
continue,
that
they
have
limited
resources
and
they
conduct
a
search
when
they
think
it's
appropriate
and
necessary.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
but
there's
never
been
any
kind
of
requirement.
i...
i
think
we
can--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--confidently
say
their
suspicions
were
focused
on
the
gas
tank,
whether
or
not
that
that
would
have
convinced
a
court
that
it
was
reasonable
under--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--this
court's
definition
i
think
is
unclear.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
well--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--there
are
extensive
training
of
customs
officials--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--about
how
to
go
about
searching
a
car,
where
to
look,
where...
where
smugglers
typically
hide
their
drugs,
and
what
type
of
evidence
they
may
leave
behind,
and
that's
what
the
agent
is
looking
for.
the
agents
are
also
trained
though,
justice
breyer,
to
rely
on
their
experience
and
intuition
and
hunches,
and
over
time
border
officials
gather
extensive
experience
about
what
they're
looking
for.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
they
also
can
consult
with
a
supervisor
if
they
have
a
question
about
whether
a
search
should
actually
be
done.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
his--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--supervisor
would
be
aware
of
the
search,
but
with
a
85
to
90
percent
success
rate,
that
possibility
seems
rather
remote.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there
may
be
checks
where
people
can
file
complaints,
i
don't
know.
but
the
same
officer
could
be
instructing
that
the
spare
tire
compartment
be
taken
apart
or
that
a
tire
be
taken
out
or
that
every
scrap
of
luggage
can
be
taken
off
or
that
the
person
could
empty
their
wallets,
their
shoes,
their
purses,
their
clothing,
and
put
the
person
to
a
considerable
inconvenience.
but
a
gas
tank
is
not
a
container,
your
honor,
that
there's
some
sort
of
heightened
expectation
of
privacy.
it
stores
fuel.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yeah,
it's
about...
cost
runs
about
a
cost
of
$90
to
$140
per
visit,
but
justice
scalia,
there
are
also,
very
consistent
with
your
point,
hundreds
of
cars
in
a
lane
that
this
inspector
has
to
get
through,
and
they
always
are
concerned
about
moving
through
the
legitimate
traffic
and
legitimate
trade.
they
want
to
get
people
in,
they
want
to
get
people
past
the
border.
at
the
same
time,
they're
extremely
concerned
about
what's
in...
what
people
might
be
concealing
in
their
vehicles,
and
a
vehicle
is
an
extremely
large
container
and
a
gas
tank
is
a
relatively
large
container,
and
given
that
it
is
25
percent
of
all
drug
seizures
have
been
hidden
in
the
gas
tank,
they
have
an
essential
interest
in
being
able
to
not
only
detect
it
when
they
think
it
might
be
there,
but
also
deter
it.
it
has
been
customs'
experience
over
many,
many
years
that
smugglers
are
looking
to
exploit
any
weakness
along
our
border
security
efforts,
and
they
will
readily
place
their
drugs
where
they're
least
likely
to
be
detected.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
ripping
out
the
upholstery
would
first
present
a
question
of
what
kind
of
intrusion
there
is
on...
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
an
interest
protected
on
the
fourth
amendment,
and
there
may
be
a
significant
deprivation
of
a
property
interest.
now,
we
would
probably
contend
that
we
could
rip
what
upholstery
was
reasonably
necessary
to
conduct
the
search.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there's
a
small
nuanced
caveat
to
that.
we
think
we
can
search
property
without
suspicion
and
use
whatever
force
is
reasonably
necessary.
at
the
same
time,
justice
ginsburg,
the
constitution
still
applies
with
respect
to
the
property
and
the
search
has
to
be
carried
out
in
a
reasonable
manner,
and
if
someone
took
a
giant
axe
and
starting
whacking
away
at
leather
upholstery,
that
would
very
well
constitute
an
unreasonable
search.
but
this
case
doesn't
involve
a
claim
of
damage
and
respondent
has
never
said
that
he
was
deprived
of
a
significant
possessory
interest
in
his
gas
tank.
rather,
what
happened,
it
was
taken
apart
and
it
could
have
been
easily
put
back
together.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
our...
that
would
be
our
position,
but
i'm
saying
it
also
involves
a
very
distinct
factor,
and
that
is
that
there's
a
deprivation
of
a
significant
property
interest
if
the
item
is
going
to
be
obliterated
or
its
value
going
to
be
destroyed,
and
that's
not
the
contention
made
in
this
case
or
the
type
of
deprivation
of
a
privacy...
of
property
interests
you
would
have
with
a
gas
tank.
but
sure,
if
you
took
a
vase
and
smashed
it
when
you
could
have
looked
in
it,
or
let
me
just
say
if
you
wanted
to
open
up
the
trunk--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
well,
we
would
look
at
first
what
the
type
of
deprivation
is,
and
if
it's
a
teeny
little
tear
that
can
be
easily
repaired,
maybe
there's
not
a
significant
deprivation.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
let's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--let's
suppose
that
there's
a
significant
deprivation.
it
would
at
least
be
reasonable
for
the
court
to
look
at
what
kinds
of
alternatives
were
available
to
the
government.
as
a
practical
matter,
justice
stevens,
we...
customs
officials
have
long,
skinny
metal
probes
which
are
like
needles
that
they
use
to
search
upholstery,
so
if
it's
fabric
you
wouldn't
even
see
it
going
in
and
out.
if
it's
leather,
you
probably
are
going
to
get
a
tiny
hole.
now,
whether
that
would
constitute
a
significant
deprivation--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--might
turn
on
the
facts
and
circumstances,
but
these
are
wonderful
pieces
of
equipment
that
customs
officials
use
all
the
time
to
look
inside
places
that
are
hard
to
see,
and
they
use
them
exactly
on
seats.
but
to
be
sure,
justice
stevens,
customs
gets
complaints
about
upholstery.
they
let
a
dog
into
a
car
and
the
dog
scratches
the
upholstery
or
the
agent's
going
in
there
and
searching
and
he
steps
on
something.
these
kinds
of
things
happen
at
the
border
and
customs
have
to...
have
a
job
to
do
and
they've
got
to
use
whatever
force
is
reasonably
necessary.
but
i
think
these
cases
are
separate
because
they
involve
some
arguably
significant
deprivation
of
the
owner's
possessory
interest
in
that
piece
of
property.
if
it's
a
leather
seat
and
it's
torn,
the
value's
gone
down.
but
the
ninth
circuit
applies
a
rule
that
doesn't
let
customs
officials
open
up
a
container
even
where
they
can
put
it
back
without
damaging
the
tank,
and
so
we
think
that
case
is
quite
distinct.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
about
the
25
percent
figure,
and
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
at
12a,
that
25
percent
figure
relates
to
vehicle
drug
seizures,
so
what
customs
meant
by
seizures
was
from
the
vehicle.
that
wouldn't
include
stuff
found
in
someone's
pockets.
justice
breyer,
you
asked
about
how
we
track
searches.
there's
apparently
a
nationwide
computer
tracking
system
where
customs
tracks
all
of
their
searches,
both
positive
and
negative,
and
when
there's
a
positive
report
search,
it's
called
a
seizure.
when
there's
a
negative,
it's
called
an
incident
report,
and
the
agent
is
in
fact
required
to
document
what
his
reasons
were...
were
for
conducting
the
search,
and
the
supervisor
must
read
that,
and
if
there
was
a
problem
developing
about
improper
use
of
his
resources
at
the
border,
the
agent
would
be
either
trained
or
disciplined.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
would
doubt
it.
i
don't
know,
justice
kennedy,
but
given
that
it
includes
the
reasons
for
conducting
the
search,
but
i...
i
just
don't
know.
i
know
it's
called
the
tecs,
but
i
don't
know
whether
that's
public
or
not.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i've
just
made
it
public.
[laughter]
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i...
i'd
have
to
go--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--on
the
internet
or
something
like
that,
justice
scalia.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
it's
quite
conceivable
if
the
country
ever
went
on
a
red
alert
that
the
commissioner
of
customs
might
say,
or
if
there
was
some
vague
intelligence
about
smuggling
in
pick-up
trucks,
they
might
want
to
do
very
extensive
searches
of
pick-up
trucks.
now
whether
they'll
actually
ever
come
to
that
i
hope
not,
but
yet,
this...
the...
the
border
power...
the
power
to
conduct
a
border
search
is
one
without
any
particularized
suspicion.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
