mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
may
i
ask
of
you
if
the
government
has
procedures
in
place
for
the
cases
in
which
inadvertently
they
damage
the
car
or...
or
maybe
the
thing
might
blow
up
on
some
occasion
or
something
like
that?
what...
what's
remedy
does
the
citizen
or
the
maybe
an
alien
or
the
citizen
have
in
that
situation?
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
would
think
there
are
a
lot
of
cases,
repair
bills
are
getting
pretty
expensive
now,
where
$1,000
wouldn't
cover
it,
the
damage
to
a
car.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
no,
i
just...
but
it's...
it's
sort
of
in
the
background
as
we're
asking
whether
it's
reasonable
in
the...
in
the...
in
an
ultimate
sense,
and
i
just...
that's
one
of
the
things
that
i'm
concerned
about
is--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
but
not
just
on
the...
the...
if
you
smash
it
unnecessarily,
but
suppose
the
only
way
to
get
behind
the
fabric
in
say
a
seat
cushion
or
something
like
that
is
to
cut
it
open.
it...
does
your
policy
apply
to
that
situation
too?
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
because
i
don't
suppose
you
have
a
seamstress
who
sews
up
the
seat
right
away.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
but
suppose
it's
something
that
cannot
be
repaired.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
you
have
to
cut
up
a
seat...
a
seat
cushion.
what...
what
do
you
do?
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
see.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court's
decision
in
montoya
established
that
for
a
search
other
than
the
routine
border
search,
reasonable
suspicion
was
required.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
four
courts
of
appeals
have
unanimously
applied
the
analysis
in
montoya
to
searches
of
property
or
effects
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
molina-tarazon
is
consistent
with
those
cases
in
that
it
applied
the
montoya
paradigm
to
the
search
of
the
gas
tank
and
the
seizure
of
the
gas
tank.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
a
ship
could
be
searched
thoroughly
without
reasonable
suspicion.
i...
but--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
i...
the
distinction
that
i
would
draw
would
be
the
point--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--of
disassembly.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
disassemble
conveyances
that
come
to
the
border.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i...
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
disassemble
a
ship
either,
particularly
in
light
of
all
of
the
various
methods
that
are
available.
i
don't
think
it's
supported
historically
either.
you
know,
the
initial
statutes
that
the
solicitor
general
cited
in
the
brief
don't
support
any
sort
of
disassembly
of
conveyances,
the...
particularly
the
1790
statute.
what
it
talks
about
is
allowing
customs
officials
on
board
to
look
around,
to
mark
items,
to
take
records
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
and
then
when
items
are
being
passed
through
customs,
then
the
customs
officer--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--and
i
certainly
would--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
what
we're
supposed
to
do
about
it
is
to
use
the
methods
that
are
tried
and
true
by
the
customs
service
itself.
if
the
customs
service
itself
wants
to
move
away
from
dismantling-type
searches
into
searches
that
involve
the
use
of
the...
their
technology--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
sometimes...
maybe
in
the
brief
i
was
too
excited
by
all
this
technology
that's
available,
but
i
think
that
sometimes
it's
important
to
start
back
at
the
initial
things.
molina-tarazon,
for
instance,
the
case
that
developed
this
rule,
found
reasonable
suspicion
based
upon
mud
spatterings
on
the
bottom
of
the
tank.
carreon,
the
tenth
circuit
decision,
found
reasonable
suspicion
in
large
part
based
upon
the
fact
that
certain
bolts
were
shiny.
so--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--mr.
chief
justice,
no
court
but
the
ninth
circuit
has
addressed
this
specific
issue
here,
the
dismantling
of
gas
tanks.
the
fifth
circuit,
though,
has
held--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i'm
sure
it
is
done,
but
there
just
hasn't
been
a
case
that
has
arisen.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
that's
correct.
but
however,
the
fifth
circuit
has
decided
that
intrusive
searches
of
property
are
subject
to
the
montoya
analysis
and
that
reasonable
suspicion
is
required
in
a
drilling
case
called
rivas.
and
in
that
case,
you
know,
they
used
a
drill
to
drill
into
the
vehicle.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
yeah,
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
would
say
it's
both
of
those
and
i
think
that
the...
of
course,
the
court's
soldal
decision
establishes
that
a
meaningful
interference,
even
if
there's
no
privacy
interest
at
all,
still
implicates
the
fourth
amendment.
but
certainly
there
are
issues
with
respect
to
value.
if
my
gas
tank
has
been
dis--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
i
think
that
there
a
number
of
concerns.
number
one,
do...
if
i
resell
the
car,
do
i
have
to
disclose
that
the
gas...
the
fuel
system
was
disassembled?
i
mean,
what
if
i
have
a
warranty?
does
that
exclude
things
from
a
repair
by
the
warranty
because
it's
been
worked
on
by
someone
who's
not
authorized
by
ford
or
whatever
company
owns
the
car?
are
there
issues
with
emissions?
you
know,
this
is
a
1987
vehicle
that
we're
talking
about
and
the
systems
are
much
more
complicated
now.
i
just
read
yesterday
a
regulation
indicating
if
you
have
a.04
gap,
you
have
to
have
a
sensor
that
can
determine
if
you
have
that
much
leakage,.04
inches,
that
you
have
to
have
a
sensor
that
determines
that
kind
of
leakage.
would
it
violate
the
terms
of
your
lease
to
have
some
unauthorized
person
or
some
person
you
don't
know
about
to
go
ahead
and
disassemble--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--no,
i'm
sure
that
it's
not,
and
certainly
you'd
have
to--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
i--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--it...
it
certainly
is...
is
not
a
tremendous
privacy
interest.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i
don't
agree
that
there's
very
little
property
damage
risk
based
on
the...
the
other
things
that
i've
just
mentioned.
plus
there's
also
the
issue
of
the
security
of
the
individual,
which
was
focused
on
in
molina-tarazon,
you
know,
what
confidence
do
you
have
that
this
crucial
system
in
your
vehicle
is
going
to
be
reliable
when
it's
been
taken
apart--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--but--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--right.
well,
people
who
smuggle
drugs
in
gas
tanks
are
willing
to
take
a
lot
of
risks,
but
the
average
traveler
who
comes
to
the
border
and
is
faced
with
the
possibility
of
random
disassembly
of
their
gas
tank
is
not
going
to
be
willing
to
take
those
risks.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
there's...
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
this
record
is...
is
that
although
the
customs
service
claims
that
it's
important
for
them
to
be
able
to
do
random
disassemblies,
they
haven't
established
any
sort
of
program
under
which
they
do
random
disassemblies,
but
there
were
several
hundred
gas
tank
disassemblies
in
which
there
were
no
drugs
found.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
right.
and
i
think
that
that
supports
the
notion
that
when
they
act
upon
suspicion
and
their
experiences,
we've
heard
detail
this
morning
that
they
can
be
effective.
that
doesn't
mean
though
that
it's
essential
to
have
the
ability
randomly
to
disassemble
based
upon
those
suspicions.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
that...
that's
the
problem
with
absolute
discretion.
any...
any
officer
across
the
united
states
can
make
the
rules
for
that
particular
day.
but
i
think
that
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
these
hunches
have,
you
know,
there
are
many--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
i
think
that
any
seizures
that
the
court
has
required
there
actually
be
founded
suspicion
are
troublesome
for
the
officers.
i
mean,
if
they
pull
people
over
randomly,
that's
time
that's
taken
away
from
other
activities
that
they
could
be
undertaking,
so
there's
always
a
natural
disinclination
to
do
that.
but
that
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
in--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
again,
i
think
that
it's
important
though
that
officers
not
be
able
to
act
arbitrarily
across
the
united
states.
it's
not...
it's
not
necessarily
going
to
be
limited
to
one
officer
so
that
we'll
always
be
able
to
weed
them
out.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i...
i
think
it's
a
factor,
but
i
don't
think
it's
as
important
as
the
other
factors
we've
talked
about,
the
potential
diminution
in
value,
the
lack
of
security
upon
the...
the
individual
who's
driving
away
in
a
vehicle
that's
been
altered
by
unknown
individuals,
and
the
fact
that,
you
know,
that--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i...
i
agree
that
the
suspicion...
that
the
privacy
interest
in
the
gas
tank
is
not
as
high
as
the
other
items
that
you've
mentioned.
however,
it
still
is
true
that
when
you
put
your
gucci
shoes
on,
you're
planning
to
take
them
off,
so
if
an
officer
takes
them
off
to
look
at
them,
that's
not
a
problem.
if
they
open
up
your
luggage,
your
luggage
is
expected
to
be
opened,
and
in
fact,
1461
requires
that
you
furnish
an
opportunity
to
open
up
that
luggage.
but
no
one
expects
that
their
gas
tank
when
they
buy
a
new
car
to
a
tremendous
expense
that
they
put
their
family
in,
no
one
expects
that
that
part
of
their
vehicle
is
going
to
be
open
like
they
know
that
their
luggage
is.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i...
don't
think
that
it's--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i
think
when
it
involves
disassembly
of
property
and--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
i
think
the
cap
off
the
bottle
is
similar
to
the
luggage.
you
would
just
open
up
the
cap
and
that...
that's
what's
expected
to
happen,
but
no
one--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i...
i
guess--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--that
could
result,
i
mean,
that
may
be
necessary--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--that
may...
it
may
be
situations
where
that
shouldn't
be
done
without--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--if
we're
talking
about
a
specific
threat,
where
there
is,
you
know,
a
specific--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i...
i
think...
i
don't
think
that...
that
suspicionless
searches
under
those
circumstances
would
be
reasonable
because
there's
not
been
any
showing
that
random
searches
or
disassemblies
of
gas
tanks
would
be
at
all
effective.
in
delaware
v.
prouse,
this
court
disapproved
the
process
of
pulling
over
people
randomly
to
check
registrations,
both
because
it
was
not
demonstrated
to
be
effective,
but
also
because
it
was
not
demonstrated
to
have
any
sort
of
deterrent
effect.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
there...
at
least
with
the
every
15
cars,
there
would
be
more
of
a
deterrent
because
then
they
would
know
that
every
fifteenth
car
is
being
searched,
but
there
is
no
program
in
place
now,
there
was
nothing
offered
below,
in
fact,
there
was
no
evidence
offered
below--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--right.
i...
i
think
that
the...
that
our
case
is
stronger
than
your
hypothetical.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
no,
i...
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
my
point
from
delaware
v.
prouse
is
that
in...
in
examining
a
random
program,
the
court
looked
to
two
things.
it
looked
to
whether
or
not
it
was
demonstrated
to
be
effective.
it's
not
demonstrated
to
be
effective
here.
and
it
also
looked
to
whether
or
not
there
was
going
to
be
a
deterrent
effect
from
it,
and
there
was
no--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--no,
i
understand.
my
point
is...
is
that
the
empirical
evidence
was
important
in
the
delaware
v.
prouse
case,
and
that's
how
this
court
distinguished
it
in
sitz,
which
is
a
case
that
the
solicitor
general
cited
in
support
of
the
notion
that
the
court
shouldn't
look
to
other
alternatives.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
i...
i
think
that--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i
think
that
it...
actually,
it's
consistent
with
our
position,
because
the
statutes
that
ross
was
talking
about
were
the
statutes
from
1789
and
1790
that
i
was
referring
to
earlier,
and
what
they
allowed
was
the
customs
officers
to
go
on
board
the
ships
to
mark
things
and
to
make
their
records
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
and
then
the
packages
would
then
be
opened
by
the
customs
officer,
and
the
first
congress
thought
this
was
a
very
significant
act,
because
not
only
did
they
require
the
customs
officer
to
open
up
the
packages,
but
they
had
to
have
two
reputable
witnesses,
merchants
outside
the
customs
service,
to
observe
those.
so
that
was
a
very
significant
event.
but
nothing
in
those
statutes
allowed
disassembly
of
vessels.
it,
in
fact,
it
did
authorize--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
they
can
look
into
it
with
all
of
the...
the
various
abilities
that
they
have.
if
they
have--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--if
they
have
reasonable--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--if
they
have
reasonable
suspicion,
they
can.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
no,
i
don't
think
they
can
open
up
the
gizmo
without
reasonable
suspicion,
but
they
still
have
all
of
the
abilities
they
have
to
bring
to
bear
on
that,
all
the...
the
experience,
all
of
their
technology,
all
of
their
ability
to
examine
things.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
yes,
they
can,
and
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
1790
statute,
which
said
that
you
could
open
up
the
packages.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i
think
that
the...
the
line
that
i'm
drawing
is...
is
the
line
that
was
drawn
by
the
first
congress
when
they
said
that
you
can
open
up
packages
and
they
didn't
provide
any
additional
authority
on
board
the
vessels--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--to
disassemble--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
of
course,
in
their
brief,
the
solicitor
generals
argued
that
that
statute
is...
does
go
along
with
the
constitutional
protection,
so
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
same
congress
that
passed
the
fourth
amendment
had
this
narrow
view
of
what
you
can
open,
packages
with
the
two
witnesses
there.
and
they
were
also
obligated
if
there
was--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well...
well,
yes.
there's
also
the
notion
of
the...
that
was
relied
upon
in
molina-tarazon,
the
security
of
the
individual
who's
in
the
vehicle,
and
there's
also
the--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--right,
yeah.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i
think
that
crates
are
intended
to
be
open.
if,
you
know,
you
packed
it
carefully
and
ultimately
you
intend
to
unpack
it,
so
you
intend
to
pack
the...
the
crate.
i
don't
think
it's
reasonable
though
to
disassemble
a
valuable
piece
of
property
that
has
safety
implications--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
i
think
what--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--right.
i
think
that
that's...
that's...
if
there's--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--no,
i
think
it's...
it's
the
property--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--no.
soldal
establishes
that
even
if
there
is
no
invasion
of
privacy,
there
is
still
a
fourth
amendment
intrusion
if
there's
a
seizure
of
property.
this
is
a
meaningful
interference
with
the...
your
enjoyment
of
the
possession
of
your
property.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
subjective
test.
i
think
it
would
be...
we're
talking
about
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
and--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
i
think
it's
different
from
any
other
container
because
it's
part
of
a
vehicle
that
was
never
expected
or
intended
by
its
designers
to
be
taken
apart
in
this
manner.
but
i
would
also
say
that
there's
been
15
years
of
history
in
which,
you
know,
courts
of
appeals
have
applied
montoya
to
searches
of
property.
if
smugglers
were
changing
their
patterns
in
response
to
those
decisions,
this...
the
tenth
circuit
rendered
its
decision
15
years
ago,
the
fifth
circuit
rendered
its
decision
5
years
ago.
the
government
offered
no
evidence
below
that
there
have
been
changes
in
smuggling
patterns
based
upon
those
courts'
decisions
applying
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
yeah,
but
those...
those
cases
it
didn't
involve
gas
tanks,
if
i
understand
correctly.
that's...
that's
correct.
they
didn't
involve
gas
tanks,
but
they
involved
vehicles,
and
basically
the
theory
was
is
that
if
smugglers--
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical?
supposing
congress
passed
a
statute
specifically
authorizing
gas
tank
searches
and
providing
in
the
statute
that
after
the
search
shall
be
conducted,
the...
there
will
be
two
people
on
hand,
one,
mr.
goodwrench,
and
one
mr.
value
appraiser,
and
they
would
have
to
give
a
good
certificate,
both
of
them
have
to
give
a
certificate
that
the
value
of
the
car
has
not
been
impaired
by
what
has
been
happened,
and
if
it
has,
the
amount
of
value
will
be
reimbursed
immediately
by
the
government
to
the
owner.
would
that
be
a
constitutional
statute?
--well,
i
think
that,
you
know,
since
ultimately
we're
talking
about
reasonableness,
that
would
address
some
of
the
objections
that
i've
made
today,
but
i
still
think--
would
it...
would
it
cure
enough
of
them
to
be
constitutional
is
the
question?
--i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
it
would,
because
i
still
think
that
that's
beyond
what
the
first
congress
envisioned
and
that's
a...
our
best
guide
to
what
the
fourth
amendment
was
intended
to
mean.
they
didn't
authorize
the
disassembly
of
the
ships
that
were
coming
into
port.
they
didn't
say
that,
you
know,
if
you
took
two
ship
builders
on
board.
what
they
said
was,
you
can
take
apart
the
packages,
things
that
are
intended
to
be
opened,
but
you
have
to
have
two
witnesses,
and
if
it
turns
out
that
there's
nothing
in
there,
you
have
to...
the
customs
officer
would
have
to
pay--
my
hypo
gave
you
your
two
witnesses.
--i...
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
justice
kennedy,
there's
no
showing
that
adopting
the
rule
that
we're
asking
for
would
have
any
effect
on
the
effect...
effectiveness
of
the
border
searches.
there's
no
evidence
offered
below
that,
you
know,
the...
if
you
deprive
them
of
the
ability
to
random
searches
that
there
will
be
even
one
more
person
who
would
get
through.
so
i
think
that
if
they--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
that's
true,
but
it
would
still
vest
the
absolute
discretion
across
the
border
for
any
customs
inspector
for
no
reason
at
all
to
disassemble
valuable
property.
that's
inconsistent
with
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
inconsistent
with
the
nation's
earliest
statutes,
it's
even
inconsistent
with
section
1461,
which
applies
directly
to
entries
from
contiguous
countries,
and
that--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--that's
correct.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
importance
is,
is
that
it
is
very...
we're
asking
for
a
standard
that's...
comports
with
what
was
adopted
in
1789
and
1790,
and
the
1461
statute
that's
currently
applicable
talks
about
allowing
the
customs
inspectors
to
look
inside
the
vehicle
by
providing
a
key,
not
by
providing
a
lift
or
providing
tools,
but
by
providing
a
key.
that's
what's
reasonable,
that's
what's
routine,
that's
what's
should
be
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
don't
have
any
additional
information
about
those.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
that
violated
those
individuals'
leases,
whether
they
felt
a
lack
of
security
as
was
discussed
in
the
molina-tarazon
case,
whether
their
warranties
were
any
way
affected,
they
simply
don't
have
any
information.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
there's
no
risk...
apparently
there's
no
evidence
of
anything
blowing
up,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
individuals'
security
was
implicated
as
they
drove
away
from
the
border
knowing
that
their
valuable
property
had
been
altered
by
unknown
government
functionaries.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off
if
you
had
something
else
to
say.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
just
want...
i
do
think
it's
correct
though,
is
it
not,
that
what
really
we're
asked
to
decide
is
whether
you
have
the
power
to
make
random
searches?
i
know
that
they're
costly
and
unlikely,
but
i
think
it...
it's...
it's
not
unlikely
in
today's
world
that
you
might
decide
you
want
to
search
every
one-hundredth
vehicle
or
ever
twenty-fifth
vehicle
to
let
the
world
know
that
even
if
they
hire
ronald
coleman
they
might
get
searched.
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
