are
we
sure
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
is
it
just
possible
that
there
was...
that
there
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
would
happen
in
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--reasonable
search
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
this
would
happen
in
a
search
where
there
is
probable
cause
as
well,
it
could
happen,
couldn't
it?
when
there's...
when
there's
reasonable
suspicion,
the
same
thing
could
happen,
couldn't
it?
and
you
also
wouldn't
have
to
pay
for
the
truck?
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
would...
and
that
would
not
render
what
was
otherwise
a
reasonable
search
unreasonable,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
mere
fact
that
there's
no
compensation
for
actual
damage,
accidental
damage
to...
to
the
truck
would
not
render
the
reasonable
search
unreasonable
if
there
were
suspicion,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
why
should
it
do
it
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
assume
that
if
there's
any
de
facto
check,
there's
more
likely
a
check
on
the
gas
tank
than
there
is
on
emptying
your
wallet
and
taking
your
shoes
off
and
everything
else,
namely
the
expense
that
it
causes
to
the
customs
service
in
time...
in
terms
of
the
time
of
its
agents,
and
i
suppose
you
have
to
pay
these
mechanics
that
come
and
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
your...
your
clients
weren't
worried
about
all
that
apparently.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
60
pounds
of
cocaine
was
good
for
the
gas
tank
either,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
talking
about
randomly.
they're...
they're
talking
about...
i...
i
think...
i
think
ms.
blatt
said
hunches.
i
mean,
there,
you
know,
there...
there
are
just
some
intuitions
that
agents
get
that
may
not
rise
to
the
level
of
what
a
court
may
acknowledge
is
an
articulable
suspicion,
and
they
shouldn't...
they
shouldn't
have
to
worry
about
whether
they
have
to
prove
that
or
not.
i...
do
you
really
think
they're
going
to
do
it
when...
when
there's
no
reason
whatever
to
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
not
as
easily
observed
and
not
as
easily
recorded
by
supervisors.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
an
agent
who
repeatedly
has
a...
cars
backing
up
at
the...
at
the
gate
that...
that
he's
controlling,
and
who
repeatedly
comes
up
empty
on...
on
gas
tank
searches,
that
fellow's
not
going
to
be
there
very
long.
i
mean,
it,
it's
easy
to
observe
somebody
who's
abusing
the
system,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
other
question
is
whether
it
is
unreasonable
to...
to
require
them
to
expect
it
if
they're
running
their
car
back
and
forth
across
the
border?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what...
why
is
it
wrong?
what...
what
test
do
you...
do
you
urge
as
to...
as
to
when...
when
a
search
by
border
agents
cannot
be
done?
what...
what
is
the
criteria?
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
that
involves
disassembly.
so...
so
what
about
taking
the
cap
off
of
a...
off
of
a
bottle
that's
there.
is
that...
is
that
disassembly?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
bottle's
sealed?
i
mean,
you
know,
it's...
it's...
it's
a
sealed
bottle?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
break
the
seal.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
can't
be
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
--wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
do
you
do
about
united
states
v.
ross
when...
when
you're
urging
your...
your...
your
disassembly
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
that...
that
was
a
case
involving
a
border
search
statute,
not...
not
the
one
at
issue
here,
to
be
sure,
but
nonetheless
what
we
said,
to
quote
it,
is
certainly
congress
intended
custom
officers
to
open
shipping
containers
when
necessary
and
not
merely
to
examine
the
exterior
of
cartons
or
boxes
in
which
smuggled
goods
might
be
concealed.
during
virtually
the
entire
history
of
our
country,
whether
contraband
was
transported
in
a
horse-drawn
carriage,
a
1921
roadster,
or
a
modern
automobile,
it
was
been
assumed
that
a
lawful
search
of
a
vehicle
would
include
search
of
any
container
that
might
include
the
object
of
the...
of
the
search.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
isn't
that
applicable
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
your...
your...
your
position
is...
is...
is
any
container,
you're
not
just
talking
about
gas
tank,
you
say
nothing
can
be
disassembled.
so
if
i
have
some
gizmo
that
is
assembled
and
is
not
meant
to
be
opened
again,
you
say
if
i
bring
that
across
the
border
the
customs
agent
can't
look
into
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can't
open
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can't...
they
can't
open
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
without
reasonable
suspicion.
i'm--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah,
but
you're...
you're
arguing
a
constitutional
restriction
here.
your...
your
argument
is
not
that
congress
has
not
provided
the
authority.
your
argument
is
congress
can't
provide
the
authority.
so
what,
it
seems
to
me
what
justice
souter
is
asking
is,
if
congress
can
provide
the
authority
to
uncrate
the
statue,
what
constitutional
prohibition
is
there
to
uncrating
the
gas
tank?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
for...
for
no
reason
at
all
they
can...
they
can
conduct
searches
of...
of
the
person,
right,
without
any
suspicion?
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
gucci
shoes
and
everything
else.
but
somehow
when
you...
when
you
reach
this...
this
magical,
what,
disassembly
of
a
vehicle,
that
that
has
some
special
constitutional
status.
i...
i
find
that
quite
implausible.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
public
that
such
a
thing
exists?
is
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but...
but...
i
mean
besides
your
word
for
it.
i
trust
you
implicitly,
but
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
cite
something
other
than
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that
was--
