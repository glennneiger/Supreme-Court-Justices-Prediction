i
suppose
you
could
also
say
it's
a
question
of
resources.
the
government
does
not
want
to
have
to
put
on
witnesses,
get
officers
up
from
the
border,
have
them
sit
in
court,
go
through
the
motion
to
suppress,
so
that
you
have
a
very
real
interest
simply
in
expediting
trial
procedures
by
taking
the
course
you
did.
i
don't
know
if
that
helps
you
on
this
article

problem
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
25
percent
figure,
you
say
25
percent
of
all
seizures
from
vehicles?
does
that
include
25
percent
of
seizures
where
you
search
the
person
or?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's...
the
25
percent
is
a
percentage
of
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
25
percent
in
terms
of
quantity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
included
in
that
base
is
seizures
from
the
person
where
somebody
has
it
in
their
pocket
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
you
prevail.
are
there
any
regulations
or...
or
procedures
under
which
you'll
keep
statistics
and
data,
so
that
say
over...
suppose
you
prevail,
then
over
the
next
five
years
we
can...
we
can
look
back
and
see
that
there
have
been
10,000
searches
and
contraband
has
been
discovered
only
5
percent
of
the
time
or
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
were
told
that
15
percent
or
20
percent
of
the
time
nothing
is
found,
80
or
85
percent
something
is.
that...
that's
my
understanding
of
the
government's
submission.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
85
percent
of
the
people
with
the
gas
tanks
that
were
searched
have
the
contraband,
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
protect
the
expectation
of
the
other
15
percent.
i...
i
suppose
that's
the
rule,
but
it...
when
the
percentages
get
these
high,
it...
it
seems
to
me
to
put
the
exclusionary
rule
somewhat
into
question
with
reference
to
the
border.
suppose
it
was
95
percent.
do
we
still
have
to
protect
the
5
percent
of
the
people?
i
mean,
i
guess
that's
the
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
works
the
other
way
around
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
those
public
documents?
