can
we
go
back
to
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
gave
a
bivens
justification
for
what
is
extraordinary.
i
mean,
it's
not
a
violation
of
article
3
for
us
to
decide
it
on
your
basis,
but
still,
this
court
deals
with
concrete
cases
with
actual
facts
and
not
with
abstract
questions.
so
is
it...
is
it
your
notion...
is
it
correct
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
says
becomes
clearly
established
law
so
that
an
officer
would
genuinely
be...
be
subject
to
bivens
liability
when
this
court
hasn't
addressed
the
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
you
mentioned,
you
started
to
give
a
number,
1,000
searches,
fuel
tank
searches,
and
then
you
gave
a
number
earlier
about
how
many
gas
tanks
turned
out
to
have
contraband
or
something.
do
you
know
what
percentage
of
those
gas
tanks
were...
was
there
disassembly
and
what
percentage
were
done
by
a
less
intrusive
means
by
the
dog
and
the
tapping
on
the
fuel
tank?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
practice
then
to
just
go
straight
to
that
procedure
and
skip
the
dog
and
the
tapping,
or
do
they
go
through
the
whole
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we...
if
you
prevail
in
this
case
and
they
don't
have
to
do
that,
they
can
just
say
it's
good
enough
to
go
right
to
the
disassembly
and
we
don't
have
to
bother
with
dogs
and
maintaining
dogs
and
anything
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
mean,
for
example,
that
you
could
rip
out
all
the
upholstery
because
you
can
hide
drugs
inside
the
upholstery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought...
i
thought
you
would,
and
maybe
i'm
recalling
your
brief
incorrectly,
but
i
thought
you...
you
made
a
distinction
between
the
kind
of
intrusive
bodily
search
like
a
strip
search
and
said
that's
the
only
one
where
you
would
need
reasonable
suspicion.
all
others,
all
that
involve
only
property
and
not
the
person,
the
rule
should
be
at
the
border,
anything
goes,
no
reasonable
suspicion
required.
is
that
the
position
the
government
is
taking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your...
your
answer
to
my
question
about
property
is,
as
long
as
you're
not
wantonly
destructive,
you
can...
any...
anything
that's
in
the
car
as
distinguished
from
a
person?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you...
when
you...
once
you...
you...
the...
the
trunk
is
fair
game,
any
luggage
is
fair
game,
fancy
gucci
shoes
might
be
fair
game,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fuel
tank,
if
we're
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the...
the...
how
much
damage
there
might
be
or
the
cost,
is...
is
a
lesser
thing
than
personal
items,
and
also
that
the
privacy
interest
is
much
stronger
in
what
we
already
say
can
be
done
without
suspicion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
that...
it
can't
be
that
he
doesn't...
well,
expected
to
be
opened
up.
if
it's...
if
it's
a
container
where
things
can
be
carried,
one
of
the
things
that
the
government
said
in
its
brief
is
that
if
luggage
is
free
and
then
this
will
become
the
container
of
choice,
and
we
know
that
in
a
very
high
percentage
there
have
found
drugs
there.
so
it
is
a
container,
we
know
it's
been
used
as
a
container.
why
should
it
not
be
treated
like
any
other
container?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you...
do
you
question
the...
the
government
gave
an
example,
i
think
from
fiscal
year
2003.
they
said
300
fuel
tanks
were
disassembled
and
put
back
along
the
southern
border
without
incident,
that
is,
no
explosion
and
no
malfunction
in
the
vehicles
for
the
travels.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be
a
graver
concern
than
a
warranty
if
the
vehicle
might
blow
up
after.
and...
but
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
evidence
of
that,
that
there's
a
high
risk
that
that
would
occur.
