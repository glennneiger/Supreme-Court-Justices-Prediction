justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
in
this
case,
i
suppose
the
government
did
have
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
wait
a
minute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
think
the
kick
of
the
gas
tank
or
the
tapping
showed
it
was
full,
not
hollow.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--am
i
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly.
and
i
think
the
dog
doesn't
bark,
he
just
alerts.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
we
have
an
agreement
on
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
ninth
circuit
would
require
evidence
of
the
training
of
the
particular
dog
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
matter
how...
how
much
you
have
to
take
apart
of
a
car
to
make
a
search?
does
that
enter
into
the
ultimate
resolution
in
the
government's
view
or
do
we
look
at
how
easy
it
is
to
remove
a
gas
tank
and
look
at
it?
does
that
matter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
much
time
does
it
take?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
take
it
off
and
put
it
back?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
mean
to
repair
it
or
to
replace
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
you
say
$100,
to
reconnect
it,
it's
about
$100?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
not
true.
i
recently
had
to
get
one,
and
it's
expensive,
i
can
tell
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
obviously
that
would
be
the
result
if
we
were
to
support
the
government's
view
here,
and
i
think
we're
interested
in
knowing
how
often
people's
gas
tanks
would
be
disassembled
if
the
government's
view
prevails
here.
how
many
times
percentage-wise
would
people
crossing
a
land
border
expect
to
have
their
gas
tank
removed
if
the
government
prevails
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
let's
say
1,000
cars
cross
the
border
point
in
an
hour.
what
percentage
of
those
will
have
their
gas
tanks
removed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
you
didn't
have
this
rule
established
that
you
didn't
need
reasonable
suspicion.
what
we're
asking
you
to
speculate
on
is
if
the
government
prevails
and
we
say,
fine,
you
can
take
the
gas
tank
off,
you
don't
have
to
have
any
degree
of
reasonable
suspicion.
then
how
many
will
there
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
say
that
a
ship
coming
in
at
a
port
in
our
country
from
elsewhere
cannot
be
searched
thoroughly
without
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
a
land
vehicle
coming
from,
for
example,
mexico
at
the
land
border
crossing
cannot
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
difference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
that
if
the
ship
came
in
that
the
gas
tank
could
be
removed
and
examined
for
presence
of
illegal
goods?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
today's
world,
the
figures,
the
statistics
are
staggering
about
how
many
narcotics
are
brought
into
our
country
by
way
of
the
use
of
gas
tanks.
i
mean,
that's
an
incredibly
large
figure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
have
to
dismantle
to
get
into
a
gas
tank
where
it...
the
opening
will
not
permit
the
entry
of
a...
the
little
looking
device.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
not
done
along
the
texas
border?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
hasn't
been
a
reported
case
where
it
was
challenged?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
the
person
filling
the
gas
tank
with
drugs
had
to
disassemble
the
tank
to
put
the
drugs
in
there,
so
apparently
willing
to
take
that
risk--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
not
willing
to
let
the
customs
service
do
the
same
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we're
talking
about
border
searches
with
customs
officials
who
are
trained
and
they
have
limited
budgets.
why
do
they
want
to
pay
the
cost
of
having
a
mechanic
disassemble
an
engine
unless
they
have
a
good
reason
for
doing
it?
i
mean,
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
they
try
to
run
up
the
number
just
to
run
up
the
number.
it's
too
expensive.
they
don't
have
that
kind
of
money.
