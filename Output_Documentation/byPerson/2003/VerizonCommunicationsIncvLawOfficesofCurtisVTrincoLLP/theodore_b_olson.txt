mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
not
a
sherman
act
violation
to
breach
a
telephone
interconnection
agreement.
the
telephone...
the
telecommunications
act
created
an
extraordinary,
carefully
crafted,
comprehensive
regulatory
and
remedial
regime
to
force
lawful
monopolies...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
did
not
brief
and
we
did
not
take
a
position
in
our
briefing
on
the
standing
question.
we...
and
our
reason
for
doing
that,
justice
stevens,
is
that
we
believe
that
in
order
to
ascertain
antitrust
standing,
one
has
to
connect
the
injury,
the
alleged
injury,
to
an
antitrust
violation.
we
feel
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
an
antitrust
violation
in
this
case
comes
before
the
determination
of
the
antitrust
injury.
and
therefore,
the
united
states
did
not
brief
that
question.
we
do
believe
that
the
'96
statute
is,
as
this
court
characterized
it
in
its
previous
review
of
that
statute,
extraordinary
in
that
it...
it
set
out
to
create
competition
in
an
area
where
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
have
accomplished
that
objective.
the...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we...
we
felt,
justice
scalia,
not
in
the
context
of
article
iii
standing,
but
in
the
context
of
prudential
standing
in
the
context
of
antitrust
standing
which
relates
specifically
to
something
this
court
has
called
antitrust
injury,
which
ties
into
the
particular
violation,
and
in
order
to
determine
that
here,
we
felt
that
the
court
would
have
to
first
answer
the
question
whether
there
is
an
antitrust
injury
itself.
is
there
any
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
that
would
give
rise
to
a
section
2,
sherman
act
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we
do
think...
we
do
think...
and
had
we
briefed
the
question,
we
would
have...
we
would
have
thought
that
there
was...
that...
that
trinko
had
some
points
here,
that
it...
this
is
not
an
illinois
brick
case...
that
trinko
was
depending
in
part
upon
service
provided
by
the
verizon
loop
and
that
it
had
a
choice,
as
the
plaintiffs...
the
plaintiff...
that
trinko
has
alleged
in
this
case,
that
it
had
a
choice
between
deficient
service
from
at&t
or...
or
paying
perhaps
a
higher
price
or
something
else
from
verizon,
that
there
are
distinctions.
and
we
think
that
they
might...
but
because
we
didn't
brief
that,
because
we
thought
it
was...
the
court
first...
we
have
a
litigant
here
that
alleges,
and
we
have
a
second
circuit
decision,
and
we've
got
other
circuit
decisions
that
have
addressed
this
very
antitrust
issue...
that
it's
very
important
to
resolve
that
case,
particularly
in
the
context
of
where
we
have
an...
a
significant,
extraordinary
effort
by
congress
to
create
a
comprehensive,
complex,
carefully
modulated
effort
to
create
something.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
we
take...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
under...
well,
yes.
in
fact,
this
is
in
answer
i
think
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
is
a...
there
would
be...
and
the
second
circuit
did
decide
that
there
was
a
right
to
action
under
the
discrimination
provisions
of
section
202.
and
this
appears...
it's
the...
the
first
full...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
first
of
all,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
and
to
the
extent
that
there
are
allegations
of
that,
the
court
addressed
that
and
reinstated
that
very
cause
of
action.
this
court
decided
not
to
review
that.
that...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
do
not
dispute,
justice
souter,
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action
recognized
by
the
second
circuit
on
page
16a...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
do
not.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
with
respect
to
that
section
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
also
true
and
there's
also
an
action
against
the...
the...
trinko
had
a
contract
with
at&t
to
supply
it
with
adequate
telephone
service.
it
may
have
a
cause
of
action
against
at&t.
to
the
extent
that
at&t
attributes
its
inability
to
provide
that
service
to
verizon,
at&t
has
already
addressed
that
under
the
exclusive
remedies
it
had
available
to
it
under
the
contract.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
actually
we
submit,
justice
kennedy,
that
what
the
communications
act
does
is
something
that
the
antitrust
laws
never
did
do.
and
the
reason
that
the
communications
act
was
in...
in
fact
necessary
to
break
up
the
monopolies,
to
cause
legitimate,
lawful
monopolies
to
do
something
that
the
antitrust
laws
wouldn't
require,
that
is,
to
open
up
their
markets,
which
they
had
no
obligation
under
the
antitrust
laws
to
do,
at
a
subsidized
rate
to
invite
in
competition...
that
entire
regulatory
scheme
was
something
that
congress
decided
was
necessary
to
do
which
no
other
laws
in
existence
had
been
able
to
do.
therefore,
not
only...
and
i
think
that
this
is
clear
from
the
court's
jurisprudence
as
well,
but
also
well
articulated
in
the
town
of
concord
decision
that
was
authored
by
justice
breyer
on
the
first
circuit.
that
regulatory
regime,
which
monitors
the
conduct
on
an
ongoing
basis,
which
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
well
equipped
to
do,
prevents
the
occurrence
of
antitrust
injury
and
inhibits
the
ability
to
accomplish
antitrust
benefits
and
monitors
the
process
in
a
way
that
succeeds
in
dealing
with
the
possibility
of
anti-competitive
conduct,
but
conduct
that
was
not
required
at
all
under
the
antitrust
laws,
that
on
opening
of
the
markets
to
selling
one's
assets
at
a
discount,
to
going
into
a
business
that
the
lawful
monopolist
was
not
already
in.
the
additional
point
there
is
that
the
treble
damage
remedy
is
considerably
more
draconian.
it
acts
in
an
ad
hoc,
specific
case
under
the
supervision
of
generalize...
generalist
judges
and
ad
hoc
juries.
whereas
congress
decided
that
the
scheme
was
most...
that
was
most
appropriate...
the
regime
that
was
most
appropriate
to
create
this
new
world
that
this
court
specifically
recognized
in
the
two
previous
telecommunications
act
cases
was
this
regulatory
regime,
inhabited
by
experts,
administered
by
experts,
where
there
are
prompt,
efficient,
effective
remedies,
and...
and
a
scheme
which
is
adjustable
from
time
to
time
to
deal
with
any
anti-competitive
conduct.
so
it's
not
only
a
reason
why
congress
said
we
do
not
change
the
antitrust
laws
by
this
statute.
there's
good
reasons
why
congress
decided
to
do
that.
but
there's
also
additional
reasons
why
the
section
2
remedy
would
be
a
sledge
hammer
in
an
area
where
congress
has
enacted
a
scalpel
to
deal...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
the
court
does
not
need
to
go
into
broader
general
principles.
and
this
court...
we...
we
addressed
those
principles
because
we
felt
we
had
an
obligation.
and
we
have
addressed...
the
government
has
articulated
those
same
principles
not
only
in
this
court...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
does...
no,
we
are
not
suggesting...
we're
not
saying
that
the...
that
the
act
provides
any
immunity.
the
act
still
exists
side
by
side.
what
we
do
say
is
that
this
was
not...
this
conduct
was
not
a
sherman
act
violation
before
the
act,
and
the
act
specifically
says...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
but
it's
specifically
true
in
the
context
of
this
regime
that
exists.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
anti-competitive
activity,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
must
look
from...
at
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
connection
with
the
particular
industry
and
in
a
particular
regime
in
which
it
exists.
so
when
this
court...
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
it
is
entirely
consistent
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
alleged
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
that
context.
the
method
that
congress
selected
to
create...
to...
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you.
