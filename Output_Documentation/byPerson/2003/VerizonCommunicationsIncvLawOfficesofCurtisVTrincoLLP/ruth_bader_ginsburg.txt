justice
ruth
bader

mr.
taranto,
you
made
a...
an
interesting
classification,
and
i
think
i
tend
to
agree
with
it,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
these
court's
cases
fit
that
mold.
i
had
thought
that
the
things
that
are
put
under
the
head
of,
quote,
prudential
standing
sound
like
does
this
person
have
a
claim
under
this
statute
for
relief.
that's
a
12(b)(6)
question.
but
the
court
seems
to
have...
think
that
there's
something
in
between
constitutional
standing,
which
everyone
agrees
exists
here,
and
12(b)(6),
and
that's
this
prudential
standing
notion.
is
there
a
difference
between
the
12(b)(6)
inquiry,
does
this
statute
afford
this
plaintiff
a
claim
for
relief,
and
what
this
court
has
called
prudential
standing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
taranto,
judge
katzmann
in
the
second
circuit,
whose
decision
we're
reviewing,
seemed
to
think
that
at&t
was
not,
as
you
expressed
it,
the
better
complainant,
but
that
the
remedy
for
at&t
was
the
administrative
context.
i...
i
thought
his
opinion
suggested
that
for
at&t
the
remedy
was
the
administrative
route,
but
for
the
customer
who
has
no
place
else
to
go,
it
was
court
or
nothing
because
the
customer
would
not
have
access
to
that
administrative
process.
now,
is
there...
first
of
all,
is...
would
at&t
have
standing
or
state
a
claim
for
relief
if
at&t
had
been
the
plaintiff
here?
and
second,
if
you're
right
that
this
plaintiff
has
no
claim
in
court,
is
there
anyplace
that
this
plaintiff
can
go
with
the
complaint?
the
reality
is...
and
we
accept
what
the
complaint
alleges
as
true
for
current
purposes...
i
have
gotten
the
worst
service.
it's
a
constant
embarrassment.
i've
lost
clients.
i've
lost
my
professional
reputation.
that's
a
legitimate
complaint.
is
there
anyone
in
the
world
that
that
can
be
asserted
against?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
had
no
choice
in
that.
i
mean,
that's
a
statutory
mechanism.
there's
no
independent
waiver
that
at&t,
as
apart
from
others,
what
they
call
them,
clec's.
it's...
it's
an...
it's
a
regime
imposed
on
all
the
participants,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
get
to
the...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
last
part?
does
this
customer
of
at&t
have
any
remedy
for
the
bad
service
that
the
customer
attributes
not
to
at&t
but
to
verizon?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
damages
available
on
that
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
you
say
that
under...
under
202
that
there
would
be
if...
if
plaintiff
prevails
on
that
claim
against
verizon,
not
at&t,
there
would
be
a
damage
remedy
for
the
loss
that
the
plaintiff
could
prove?
in
other
words,
does
it
give
the
plaintiff
the
same
thing
that
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
here
except
it's
not
trebled?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
did
judge
katzmann
say
a
couple
of
times
the
only
opportunity
for
the
plaintiff
to
get
damages
is
if
there
is
this
second
section
2
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i...
i
thought
mr.
taranto
said
this...
there
is
no
discrimination
in
this
case.
so
that
if
that's
true,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
remedy
under
207.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
verrilli,
in
attempting
to
determine
whether
these
two
pieces
of
legislation
operate
on
separate
tracks,
telecommunications
act,
section
2,
judge
wood
said
one
of
the
problems
with
reading
the
telecommunications
act
effectively
into
section
2
is
that
it
then...
then
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
might
eclipse
this
elaborate
regime
that
congress
set
up
because
why
would
any
player
want
to
use
that
mechanism
instead
of
coming
into
court
with
the
possibility
of
getting
treble
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
after
because...
because
certainly
at&t
could
go
back
to
the
regulator
and
say...
