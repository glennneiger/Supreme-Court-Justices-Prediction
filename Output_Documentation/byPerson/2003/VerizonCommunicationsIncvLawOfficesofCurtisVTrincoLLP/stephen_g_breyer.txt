justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
otter
tail...
otter
tail
seems
like
the
strongest
precedent
against
you.
before
you
say
the
reasons
against
expansion,
i'd
just
like
to
hear
30
seconds
on
why
in
your
opinion
otter
tail
is
different
than
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
there
any
reason
he
can't
go
to
the...
the
psc
like
anybody
else
can
and
say
i
have
ducks
on
the
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
hear
anything.
it's
terrible
and
then
they
issue
an
order.
and
if
they
don't
follow
the
order,
you
go
to
court
and
sue
them
for
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
the...
what
bothers
me
about
the
illinois
brick
problem
is...
i
completely
agree
with
your
characterization,
but
the
law
would
seem
odd
that
would
say
when
smith,
a
price-fixing
ring,
charges
jones
$3
extra,
we
don't
let
jones'
customers
sue
for
the
actual
overcharge
he
undoubtedly
suffered.
but
in
fact,
when
smith,
the
monopolist,
drives
jones
through
predatory
pricing
out
of
the
market,
we
let
jones'
customers
come
in
and
say,
oh,
my
service
isn't
as
good,
i...
i
may...
i
don't
know
exactly.
i
might
have
switched.
i...
i
got
bad
service,
et
cetera.
you
see
how
much
more
ephemeral
that
is,
how
much
more
uncertain
it
is,
how
much
more
vague
it
is?
and
the
more
precise
thing
we
don't
let
them
recover
for.
the
more
vague
thing
on
your
theory,
which
is
highly
speculative,
we
will,
on
your
view,
let
them
recover
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
other
thing
on...
on
the...
that
i
had
as
a
question
on
the
merits
of
the
complaint
is
i...
i...
if
this
complaint
had
said
that
verizon
went
to
the
customers
who
were
trying
to
use
at&t
and
said,
mr.
customer,
we're
going
to
wreck
your
service
unless
you
buy
from
us,
or
indeed
carried
that
out
in...
through
surreptitious
ways,
but
that's
what
he
was
saying.
you
buy
from
us
or
you'll
be
sorry.
if
that's
what
the
complaint
said,
you
might
well
have
a
complaint.
but
i
don't
see
that
in
the
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rather,
what
i
see
in
the
complaint...
and
i
want
you
to
point
out
where
it's
the
contrary...
is
that
every
claim
of
bad
service
is
connected
through
a
because
or
some
other
word
like
that
to
the
refusal
of
verizon
to
hook
up
at&t,
i.e.,
to
provide
them
with
the
verizon
service
so
they
can
provide
service
to
the
customer.
now,
i've
read
the
complaint
a
few
times,
but
i
want
you
to
point
out
to
me
the
part
that
you
think
most
clearly
contradicts
what
i
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
2
is
the
overview.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
not
with
you
completely
for
the
reason
that
the
overview
seems
to
be
an
overview
which
is
explicated
by
the
specific
complaints
of
exclusionary
conduct
which
appear
later
in
the
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
would
like
you
to
point
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
with
paragraph
54,
which
i
thought
was
the
heart
of
the
complaint,
what
it
seems
to
say
at
the
end
is
when
they
did
these
bad
things,
the
plain
effect
was
that
at&t
was
prevented
from
offering
local
phone
service
of
the
quality,
as
was
offered
by
bell,
and
thereby
to
impede
the
ability
of
at&t
to
compete.
and
so
i
took
54
as
being
essentially
a
complaint
that
at&t
is
kept
out
of
the
market.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
don't,
in
other
words,
have
an
obligation
to
bring
them
into
the
market...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
the
antitrust
laws,
you
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
don't...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
don't,
do
you
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
cooperation?
i
mean,
the...
the
main
obstacle
in
my
mind
to
your
argument
is
that
if
we
accept
your
argument,
it
will
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
not
to
agree
to
interconnect
with
the
new
competitor
coming
in.
immediately
it
will
be
a
question
of
was
that
refusal
reasonable
or
not.
what
were
the
terms?
what
were
the
pricing?
what
was
the
lease
arrangement,
et
cetera?
because
there's
no
way
to
know
whether
it's
justified
or
not
justified
under
the
law
without
going
into
those
details.
you
and
i
both
know
that
there
have
been
opinions
written
in
this
court
that
just
skim
the
surface
of
the
complexity
of
answering
that
kind
of
question.
and
the
main
obstacle
to
your
argument
in
my
mind
is
it
seems
to
be
a
question
of
whether
that
incredibly
complex
question
will
be
answered
by
a
regulatory
agency
in
a
regulatory
proceeding
brought
by
complainants
or
by
500
judges
and
juries
in
antitrust
cases
throughout
the
country,
each
potentially
reaching
a
different
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
many
of
those
regulatory
requirements
consist
of
something
called
telric
blank
slate,
which
happened
to
cover,
you
know,
an
unbelievable
number
of
pages
and
i'm
sure
would
come
into
the
argument
about
whether
the
pricing
condition
is
or
is
not
a
reasonable
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
