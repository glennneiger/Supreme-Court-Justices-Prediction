mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
the
facts
alleged,
trinko
cannot
sustain
its
complaint
unless
the
court
newly
recognizes
a
section
2
duty
of
a
monopolist
to
turn
over
its
sales
to
rivals
by
sharing
its
assets
at
specially
discounted
prices,
that
is,
a
duty
to
dismantle
itself.
our
argument
is
that
that
hasn't
ever
been
a
section
2
duty
and
shouldn't
now
be
made
into
one.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
don't
think
that
illinois
brick...
in
fact,
i
think
illinois
brick
is
not
a
jurisdictional
point.
it
is
a
question
of
cause
of
action
that
goes
to
certain
kinds
of
damages.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
we...
we
do
think
you
should,
but
that
it
shouldn't
preclude
the
court
from
reaching
the
merits,
which
are
of
much
broader
importance.
that
is,
in
the
absence
of
the
rule
being
a
jurisdictional
one,
the
court
has
the
option
of
considering
either
of
two
grounds
for
reversing
and
reinstating
the
dismissal,
just
as
the
court
did
in
the
sovereign
immunity
case
involving
israel
last
year
where
there
were
two
alternative
grounds.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
merits
question
is
a
much
more...
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
oh,
we...
we
think
so
as...
as
well,
and
let
me...
let
me
address
that
briefly.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
yes.
the...
the
statutory
standing
question
has
always
been
treated
as
a
question
of
what
the
meaning
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
the
damages
provision,
is
here,
and
both
the
indirect
purchaser
rule
and
the
more
general
indirectness
aspect
of
associated
general
contractor
has
to
do
with
who
can
get
what
kinds
of
relief.
that's
not
a
jurisdictional
question,
and
therefore
it
remains
open
to
this
court
to
do
what
we
think
the
court
should
do,
which
is
also
to
address
the
question
that
is
directly
dividing
the
circuits,
what
is
the
scope
of
section
2.
and...
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
best
that
i
can
do
with
that
is
to
describe
what
the
court
has
done
in
the
cases
that
we
rely
on
for
saying
there's
no
statutory
standing.
associated
general
contractors
and
illinois
brick
and
its
follow-on,
kansas
against
utilicorp,
are
all
about
the
interpretation
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
in
that
sense,
they
are
classic
12(b)(6)
questions.
the
entire
analysis
in
associated
general
contractors
is
about
what
the
term
injury
to
business
or
property
means.
they
are
interpretive
questions
in
that
way.
they're
not
separate
prudential
standing
questions
somewhere
between
constitutional
standing
and
statutory
coverage.
and
that's
why
we
think
it
is
both
proper
and
really
quite
important
for
purposes
of
the
several
other
circuit
cases
that
are
now
sitting
in
cert
petitions
in
this
court
on
the
merits
question
that
divides
the
circuits.
there
is
no
section
2
duty
on
the
merits
now
to
turn
over
your
sales
to
a
rival.
this
court
said,
as
far
back
as
1920
in
the
u.s.
steel
case,
section
2
does
not
condemn
mere
size.
section
2
does
not
compel
competition.
the
1996
act
does.
it
has
a
quite
different
policy.
it
says
we
will
mandate
creation
of
competition.
section
2
says
we
protect
against
affirmative
interferences
in
independently
arising
competition.
they're
fundamentally
different
statutory
approaches
to
a
highly
general
goal
of
competition.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
is
a
kind
of
refusal
to
deal.
it
is...
all
of
the
claims
in
this
case,
all
of
the
facts
allege
inadequate
help
to
rivals
to
come
and
displace
one's
own
sales.
this
court
has
broadly
recognized
that
section
2
protects
the
right
to
just
make
your
sales
and
not
turn
them
over
to
rivals
with
a
category
of
exceptions.
every
one
of
those
exceptions,
the
refusal
to
deal
cases,
involves
discrimination.
the
firm
was
voluntarily
in
the
business
of
selling
the
product
that
the
plaintiff
wanted,
and
the
plaintiff
wanted
it
at
the
terms
that
the
firm
was
selling
it
to
others,
and
the
defendant
said,
no.
that
threshold
condition
has
so
far
been
the
only
sufficiently
reliable
one
to
trigger
the
inquiry,
if
you're
selling
it
to
some...
to
everybody
else,
why
not
to
the
particular
plaintiff?
and
the
answer,
we're
not
selling
to
the
plaintiff
because
the
plaintiff
is
a
rival
or
the
plaintiff
is
dealing
with
a
rival,
has
been
the
one
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
forced
sales
to
help
rivals
is
not
adequate.
discrimination
doesn't
mean
that...
mean
illegality.
there
may
be
good
reasons,
but
it
so
far
has
been
the
necessary
threshold
condition
for
demanding
an
inquiry.
this
case
does
not
involve
any
kind
of
discrimination
like
that.
there's
no
allegation
here.
there
couldn't
be
an
allegation
that
verizon
was
in
the
business
of
renting
out
its
facilities
to
rivals
at
specially
discounted
prices
before
the
1996
act
compelled
that.
so
for
trinko
to
prevail
here,
it
would
have
to...
the
court
would
have
to
recognize
something
brand
new
under
section
2.
it
would
have
to
expand
section
2
to
where
it
has
never
been
before,
and
we
submit
there
are
extremely
good
reasons
for
not
doing
that.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
otter
tail
was
also
a
case
of
discrimination.
if...
the
opinion
in
otter...
in
otter
tail
is
a
little
bit
shy
on
full
explanation
for
what
factors
matter,
and
so
one
has
to
look
at
what
the
facts
were.
if
you
look
at
the
extensive
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
judge,
which
are
in
the...
not
the
appendix
of
this
case
but
the
appendix
in
otter
tail,
there's
an
entire
section
called
discrimination.
otter
tail
at...
at
j.a.
103
to
111.
otter
tail
was
undisputedly
in
the
business
of
wholesaling
power
and
of
wheeling
power
to
others.
when
particular
communities
came
and
said
we
want
from
you
the
same
thing
that
you're
happily
selling
to
others,
otter
tail
said
no.
that's
exactly
the
same
kind
of
discrimination
that
existed
in
aspen
skiing
where
the
three
mountain
defendants
said,
we
won't
even
take
full
price
ski
tickets
from
people
who
are
using
the
fourth
mountain
because
that's
a
rival.
so
discrimination
was
the
predicate
there
too.
this
is
not
a
case
of
discrimination.
in
the
absence
of
discrimination,
any
court
entertaining
a
section
2
duty
would
have
to
undertake
tasks
that
antitrust
has
never
viewed
as
appropriate.
it
would
have
to
ask
what
are
the
effects
on
long-run
investments,
the
long-term
effects
on
investments.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i...
we
think
not
really
for...
for
a
combination
of
reasons.
all
of
the
factors
in
associated
general
contractors
i
think
point
in
the
same
direction.
the
injury
here
is
indirect.
that
is,
trinko
was
a
customer
of
at&t
which
was
a
customer
of
verizon,
and
trinko's
injury
was
only
an
indirect
result
of
the
alleged
injury
to
at&t.
the
additional
considerations
point
in
the
same
direction.
there's
obviously
a
better
plaintiff.
at&t.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
the...
the
final...
final
reason
i'll
mention
here
is
that
recognizing
the
statutory
cause
of
action
here
would
also
interfere
with
the
voluntarily
agreed
upon
nonjudicial
dispute
resolution
mechanism
that
at&t
and
verizon
entered
into.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
let
me
take
those
in...
in
order,
if
i
may.
at&t
could,
of
course,
have
brought
a
sherman
act
suit
had
it
not
expressly
waived
its
right
to
go
to
court.
it
adopted
instead
a
mechanism
by
which
it
secured
relief
far
more
promptly
than
any
antitrust
case
would
have...
would
have
obtained.
so
it's
like...
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
that...
that...
nondispute
judicial...
dispute
judicial...
nonjudicial
dispute
resolution
was
here
part
of
an
agreement.
it's
not
in
the
statute.
many
agreements
contain
it.
some
agreements
do
not
contain
it.
this
one
does.
and
it
serves
very
important
statutory
functions
of
providing
what
here
took
only
3
months
or
so
fully
to
resolve
the
problem
and
to
provide
compensation
to
at&t.
and
that's...
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it...
it
could
go
to
the
commission
or
it
could
bring
a
sherman
act
suit
unless,
of
course,
as
we
do
contend,
there
is
no
legitimate
section...
section
2
claim.
but
as
far
as
standing
is
concerned,
the
customer,
that
is,
at&t,
has
standing.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
new
york
public
service
commission
settlement
settled
the
new
york
problem.
there
was
an
fcc
national
level
consent
decree
that
on
a
going-forward
basis
settled...
solved
the
problem.
the
problem
was
in
fact
a...
a
new
york-specific
one,
and
here
we're
talking
about
the
only
concrete
instance
in...
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i...
i'm...
i'm...
i
don't
know
that
at&t
has
signed
similar
agreements
for
the
rest
of
the
country.
this
particular
problem
that
gave
rise
to
this
problem
was
fully
resolved
in
new
york
with
compensation
to
at&t
and
nationally
at
the
fcc
level.
so
i...
i...
at&t
certainly,
wherever
it
hasn't
adopted
an
arbitration
agreement,
the
way
any
other
plaintiff
can
adopt,
certainly
has
a
right
to
go
to
court
and
to
argue
as...
as
covad
has
in
the
eleventh
circuit
case,
as
cavalier
has
in
the
fourth
circuit
case,
to
argue
that
there
is
a
sherman
act
claim,
and
that's
the
merits
claim
that
is
before
this
court
as
part
of
this
case
as
well.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i...
i
don't
think
there
could
have
been
any
different
allegations
on
the
dispositive
point.
as
long
as
the
allegations
are
the
incumbent
insufficiently
helped
the
rival...
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
and...
and
those...
those
claims,
to
the
extent
that
they're
not
helping
hand
kinds
of
claims,
would
of
course
be
outside
the
analysis.
the
cavalier
case,
the
covad
case
are
overwhelmingly,
as
this
case
is,
helping
hand
cases,
as
the
goldwasser
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
was,
and
that's
the
core
issue
that...
that
all
of
these
cases
are
about.
now...
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
well,
first,
in
this
very
case
the
second
circuit
reinstated
the
section
202
claim
of
this
plaintiff
and
this
court
denied
cert
on
that.
so
that
claim
is
alive
in
this
very
case.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
claim
is...
is
a
claim
under
the
damages
provision
of
section
207
for
an
alleged
violation
of
the
substantive
communications
act
provision
in
section
202.
they,
of
course,
also
have
any
remedies
any
customer
has
for
lousy
service
here
against
at&t,
the
provider
of
the
service,
which
received
compensation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
plaintiff
certainly
asks
for
the
same
damages.
section
202...
section
207
is
the
liability
damages
provision
of
the
communications
act.
the
second
circuit
said
that
that
provision
was
available
to
this
plaintiff
to
seek
recovery
for
injury
from
the
alleged
violation
of
section
202.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i'm...
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
that
question,
having...
the
court
having
reinstated
that...
that
claim.
that
is
a
damages
claim.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
words
competition,
obstruction
of
competition,
pro-competitive
mask
a
fundamental
distinction
between
the
1996
act
and
the
sherman
act.
the
'96
act
creates
competition.
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
has
always
gone
no
further
than
protecting
independently-developed
competition.
the
'96
act
is
a
comprehensive
regime
for
policing
the
thousand
ways,
as
mr.
verrilli
said,
in
which
the
obligations
to
create
competition
might
be
violated.
this
complaint,
if
you
look
at
the
two
paragraphs
that
mr.
verrilli
cited,
paragraph
2
and
paragraph
54,
are
all...
is
all
about
helping
to
create
competition.
paragraph
2
says
the
conduct
we
complain
of
is
that
verizon
was
making
it
difficult
to
obtain
full
use
of
verizon's
local
loops.
there
is
no
allegation
of
obstruction
of
at&t's
independent
efforts
to
create
seller/
buyer
transactions
on
its
own
without
help.
what
we
ask
the
court
to
say
on
the
merits
here
is
not
that
there
is
a
rigid
requirement
of
discrimination
or
anything
else.
what
we
ask
the
court
to
recognize
is
that
up
till
now...
till
now...
helping
hand
cases
have
been
limited
by
the
requirement
of
discrimination
between
customers,
not
between
self
and
others,
but
between
customers,
and
there
are
compellingly
strong
reasons
not
to
expand
section
2
beyond
that.
for
institutional
reasons,
the
antitrust
courts
are
not
capable
of
reliably
making
the
necessary
determinations
and
for
fundamental
incentive
reasons,
the
incentives
of
incumbents
to
invest,
the
incentives
of
rivals
to
invest
rather
than
piggy-back.
in
this
context,
a
common
law-like
context,
there's
no
question
of
overriding
preexisting,
settled
antitrust
obligations.
the
question
is
should
the
court
create
something
new.
and
in
a
common
law-like
area,
the
existence
of
another
regime
is
one
strong
reason
not
to
create
something
new.
the
court
said
so
in
the
black
&
decker
case
only
last
term
involving
the
common
law
of
erisa
obligations
when
the
court
said
the
scope
of
permissible
judicial
innovation
is
narrower
where
other
federal
actors
are
engaged.
that's
what
we
ask
the
court
to
decide,
that
the
1996
act
is
one
compellingly
good
reason
not
to
create
new
section
2
law
here.
thank
you.
if
the
court
has
no
further...
