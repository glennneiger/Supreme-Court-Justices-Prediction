mr.
taranto,
would
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
did
the
at&t
settlement
just
settle
the
new
york
area
problems
or
was
it
nationwide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
was
under
the
impression
at&t
retained
the
right
to
sue
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
in
fact,
they
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
which
suggests
that
they
still
have
an
interest
in
the
ongoing
controversy,
but
not
in
new
york.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
their
position
is
that
this
isn't
the
best
test
case
because
this
plaintiff
didn't
make
all
the
right
allegations,
as
i
read
their
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they...
they
alleged
that
in
other
areas,
that
there
had
been...
that
there's
been
sham
litigation,
fraudulent
misrepresentations,
and...
and
affirmative
misconduct,
in
addition
to
failing
to
comply
with
all
the
requirements
of
the
'96
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
do
you
have
a
position
on
the
standing
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
say
the
communications
act
has
superseded
the
sherman
act
when
the
statute
itself
says
it
didn't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
a
different
point
than
the
one
justice
scalia
made.
you're
saying
there
was
no
antitrust
violation
whether
or
not
there
was
a
communications
act
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
there
a
proximate
cause
problem
in
this
case
too?
you...
you
represent
a
class,
i
think.
your...
and
is
it
not
likely
that
the...
there
are
many,
many
members
of
the
class
who
have
different
kinds
of
injuries
from
the
other
members
of
the
class?
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
understand
precisely
how
the
wrongdoing
that
affected
at&t
necessarily
carries
over
to
customers
of
at&t.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you...
are
you
alleging
that
they
not
merely
failed
to
perform
their
duties,
but
they
actually
interfered
with
at&t's
performance
of
its...
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that's
a
little
different
from
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
described
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
have
to
have
alleged
in
your
complaint
just
how
it
was
that...
that
verizon's
misconduct
hurt
your
clients.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
