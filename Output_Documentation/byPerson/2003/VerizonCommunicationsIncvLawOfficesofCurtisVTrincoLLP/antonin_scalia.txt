we
have
an
illinois
brick
problem
before
we
even
get
to
the
substantive
question,
don't
we?
i
mean,
why...
why
should
we
entertain
this...
this
case
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand,
but...
but
those...
those
standing
rules
that
are
not
jurisdictional
are
still
standing
rules,
and
we
normally
apply
them.
why
should
we
not
apply
our
normal
rule
of
standing
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i've
just
been
thinking
about
your
prior
answer,
and
i...
we
certainly
don't...
don't
do
this
for
standing
normally.
we...
we
say
the
question
of
whether
there's
been
an
injury
comes
before
the
question
of
whether
there's
been
a
violation.
that's
what
standing
is
all
about.
and...
and
you...
you
say
that
the
government
has
just
concluded
that...
that
both
questions
are...
are
of
equal
priority,
and
that...
that's
just
not
the
way
we
usually
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
do
we
have
to
accept
or
buy
into
your
broader
no-help
theory
of
the
antitrust
laws
if
we...
we
accept
what
you've
just
said?
why
can't
we
just
say
in
this
particular
instance,
we
don't
have
to
adopt
any
general
principles
of
antitrust
law,
but
in
this
particular
instance
the
communications
act
has
just
superseded
the
sherman
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
if
he
hasn't
sued
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
retail
obligation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
then
you
have
the
jury
determining
whether...
whether
telric
pricing
is...
has
been
properly
applied
or
not.
don't
you...
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
only
when
the
claim
relates
not
to
the
refusal
to
interconnect,
but
to
the
failure
to
provide
adequate
service
after
interconnection
pursuant
to
a
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
suppose
it's
a
refusal
to
interconnect.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
refusal
to
enter
into
a
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
that
case
at
least
you'd
have
to
put
to
the
jury
the
question
of
whether
the
refusal
to
enter
into
this
contract
was
an
unreasonable
one,
which
would
depend
on
these
very
subtle
pricing
determinations.
justice

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
telecommunications
act
of
1996
imposes
upon
an
incumbent
local
exchange
carrier
or
lec
the
obligation
to
share
its
telephone
network
with
competitors.
petitioner,
verizon
communication,
inc.,
is
the
incumbent
lec
in
new
york
state.
as
it
is
obliged
to
do
under
the
1966
act,
verizon
has
signed
interconnection
agreements
detailing
the
terms
of
its
network
sharing
with
rivals
such
as
at&t,
the
so-called
competitive
lecs.
part
of
its
sharing
obligation
is
the
provision
of
access
to
certain
operations
support
systems
or
osss.
without
which,
a
rival
cannot
fill
its
customers’
orders.
verizon’s
interconnection
agreement
was
approved
by
the
new
york
public
service
commission
and
its
authorization
to
provide
long
distance
telephone
service
was
approved
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
each
of
those
approvals
specify
the
mechanics
by
which
its
oss
obligation
will
be
met.
when
competitive
lecs
complained
that
verizon
was
violating
that
obligation,
the
state
and
federal
agencies,
the
new
york
state
psc
and
the
fcc,
opened
parallel
investigations
which
led
to
the
imposition
of
financial
penalties
and
other
requirements
on
verizon.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
a
law
firm
that
is
a
local
telephone
customer
of
at&t
then
filed
this
class
action
alleging
that
verizon
had
filled
rival’s
orders
on
a
discriminatory
basis
as
part
of
an
anticompetitive
scheme
to
discourage
customers
from
becoming
or
remaining
customers
of
competitive
lecs
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
of
federal
telecommunications
law.
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
claim,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
but
the
court
of
appeals
reinstated
it.
we
granted
certiorari
limited
to
the
question
whether
respondent’s
alligations
of
an
alleged
breach
of
verizon’s
duty
to
share
its
network
with
competitors
states
a
claim
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
a
saving
clause
in
the
1996
act
provides
that
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
modify,
impair,
or
supersede
the
applicability
of
the
antitrust
laws.”
this
preserves
claims
that
satisfy
established
antitrust
standards,
but
it
also
forbids
the
creation
of
new
claims
that
go
beyond
those
standards.
a
few
of
our
past
cases
have
held
a
refusal
to
cooperate
with
rivals
to
be
anticompetitive
conduct
cognizable
under
section
2.
thus,
creating
narrow
exemptions
to
the
general
rule
that
there
is
no
duty
to
aid
competitors.
the
question
before
us
today
is
whether
the
alligations
of
respondent’s
complaint
fit
within
those
existing
exceptions
or
provide
a
basis
under
traditional
antitrust
principles
for
recognizing
a
new
exception.
the
activity
that
respondent
complains
of
does
not
come
within
a
rule
of
liabilities
set
forth
in
our
prior
cases.
it
does
not
come
within
the
prior
exceptions.
respondent
understandably
places
heavy
reliance
upon
aspen
skiing
company
versus
aspen
highland
skiing
corporation,
a
case
in
which
the
court
reasoned
that
the
defendant’s
termination
of
a
voluntary
agreement
with
the
plaintiff.
they
had
an
agreement
to
share
lift
tickets
essentially
and
the
defendant
terminated
that
agreement,
and
the
court
found
that
that
termination
suggested
a
willingness
to
forsake
short
term
profits
in
order
to
achieve
an
anticompetitive
end
to
wit
monopolization.
aspen
however,
is
at
or
near
the
outer
bound
of
section
2
liability,
and
the
present
case
does
not
fit
within
the
limited
exception
that
it
recognized.
because
the
complaint
does
not
allege
that
verizon
ever
engaged
in
a
voluntary
course
of
dealings
with
its
rivals,
with
at&t
or
anybody
else,
its
prior
conduct
sheds
no
light
upon
whether
its
lapses
from
the
legally
compelled
dealing
were
meant
to
destroy
competition.
more
fundamentally,
the
aspen
defendant
refused
to
provide
its
competitor
with
a
product
it
already
sold
at
retail.
whereas
here,
the
unbundled
elements
offered
pursuant
to
section
251
of
the
1996
act
are
not
available
to
the
public,
but
are
provided
to
rivals
under
compulsion
and
that
considerable
expense.
our
conclusion
would
not
change
even
if
we
consider
it
to
be
established
law
the
so-called
essential
facilities
doctrine
that
has
been
adopted
by
some
lower
courts.
the
indispensable
requirement
for
the
essential
facilities
doctrine
is
the
unavailability
of
access
to
the
essential
facilities,
where
access
is
available
or
it
exists
like
it
does
here,
because
of
the
1996
act
the
essential
facilities
doctrine
serves
no
purpose.
finally,
we
do
also
not
think
that
traditional
antitrust
principle
justify
adding
the
present
case
to
the
few
existing
exceptions
from
the
general
rule
of
no
duty
to
aid
competition.
antitrust
analysis
must
always
be
attuned
to
the
particular
structure
and
circumstances
of
the
industry
at
issue.
when,
as
here,
there
exists
a
regulatory
structure
designed
to
deter
and
remedy
anticompetitive
harm,
the
additional
benefit
to
competition
provided
by
antitrust
enforcement
will
tend
to
be
small
and
it
will
be
less
plausible
that
the
antitrust
laws
contemplate
such
additional
scrutiny.
here,
verizon
was
subject
to
oversight
by
both
state
and
federal
agencies.
both
of
which,
responded
to
the
oss
failure
raised
in
respondent’s
complaint
by
imposing
fines
and
other
burdens
on
verizon
against
the
slight
benefits
of
antitrust
intervention
here
must
be
weighed
a
realistic
assessment
of
its
costs.
alligations
of
violations
of
sharing
duties
are
both
technical
and
extremely
numerous
and
hence,
difficult
for
antitrust
courts
to
evaluate.
applying
section
2'
srequirements
to
this
regime
can
readily
result
in
many
false
positives
that
is
mistaken
inferences
that
chill
the
very
conduct
of
the
antitrust
laws
are
designed
to
protect.
for
these
reasons,
and
others
discussed
in
the
opinion
released
today,
we
hold
that
respondent’s
complain
fails
to
state
a
claim
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
reverse
the
contrary
judgment
of
the
second
circuit.
the
opinion
is
unanimous
among
the
six
justices
who
reach
the
merits
of
the
case.
justice
stevens
however,
in
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
joined
by
justices
souter
and
thomas,
would
reverse
for
want
of
the
antitrust
standing
on
the
part
of
the
respondent.
