justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
a
kind
of
refusal
to
deal
case?
so
it
could
be
covered
in
theory
by
section
2?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
you're
back
into
the
merits,
aren't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
did
you
finish
with
the
inquiry
of
whether
we
should
recognize
this
plaintiff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
at&t
didn't
bring
an
antitrust
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
verrilli?
yes,
but
this
is
in
some
ways
a
sort
of
derivative
cause
of
action
that
trinko
brings
with...
with
the
primary
injured
party
probably
being
at&t.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
it
is
a
concern
when
you
address
it
in
this
context,
isn't
it?
