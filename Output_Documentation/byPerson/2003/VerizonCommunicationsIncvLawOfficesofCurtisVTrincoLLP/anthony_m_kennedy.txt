m.

well,
it
seems
to
me...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
you're
just
trying
to
rush
to
the
merits.
i...
i
think
the
standing
and
the
issues
are
very
serious
issues
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
asking
us
to
do
that
in
a
case
where
a...
a
plaintiff
without
a
real
interest
may
be
the
one
that's...
that's
demanding
that...
that
adjudication.
this
is
very
odd.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to...
to
get
to...
to
the
merits
part
of
the
case,
the
sacrifice
test
that
you
want
us
to
adopt
assumes
that
certain
acts
are
not
pro-competitive.
but
in
this
case,
doesn't
the
telephone...
doesn't
the
1996
communications
act
tell
us
that
certain
acts
are
not
pro-competitive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
at
some
point
in...
in
your
standing
discussion,
could
you
address
whether
or
not
trinko
could
just
have
sued
at&t,
say
you're
giving
us
lousy
service,
we
want
our
money
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
usually
a
defense,
the
failure
of
the
contracting
party
to
deliver
adequate
services
under
the
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are...
are
you
saying
that
the
telecommunications
act
imposes
new
duties
and
the
violation
of
those
duties
now
becomes
an
antitrust
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
to
talk
about
the...
about...
about
the
facts
of...
of
the...
of
the
market.
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seemed
to
me
the
thrust
of
justice
souter's
question
as
well
was
that
the
telecommunications
act
imposes
new
duties,
and
violation
of
those
new
duties
is...
is
really
the
gravamen
of
your
complaint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
does
it
say
we
define
pro-competitive
in
a...
in
a
way
based
on
the
telecommunications
act?
the
telecommunications
act
is
pro-competitive.
