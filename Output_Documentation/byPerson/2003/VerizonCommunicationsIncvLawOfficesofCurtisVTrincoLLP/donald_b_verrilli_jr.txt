mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'll
address
the
standing
question
first
and
explain
why
consumers
in
trinko's
position
have
standing
and
why
general
olson
is
correct
that
illinois
brick
is
not
a
problem.
then
i'll
show
why
it
would
be
unwise
and
unwarranted
to
adopt
the
discrimination
test
that
my
friends
on
the
other
side
advocate
as
a
matter
of
section
2
law
and
why
the
1996
act
is
crucially
relevant
and
why
the
antitrust
laws
in
that
act
should
be
enforced
in
tandem,
as
congress
indicated.
now...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
trinko
could
have
brought
a
suit
like
that.
of
course,
at&t
would
have
then
said
it
was
verizon's
fault,
which
it
was,
and
there
would
be...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
that...
that's
correct,
but
in
this
situation,
there...
there
might
well
be
filed
rate
doctrine
problems
with
a
suit
like
that.
there
would
be
all
kinds
of
a
problems
with
a
suit
like
that.
and
in
any
event,
because
trinko
has...
has
an
is
a
proper
plaintiff
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
is
entitled
to
invoke
the
sherman
act,
the
fact
that
they
had...
it
has
other
remedies
seems
to
me
beside...
beside
the
crucial
point.
now,
under
reiter
against
sonotone,
this
court
held
that
consumers
have
standing
under
section
4
of
the
sherman
act...
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
to
sue
when
they
are
injured
by
anti-competitive
conduct
that
raises
prices
or
lowers
quality
in
the
market
where
they
purchase.
that
is
what
mr.
trinko
is
alleging.
illinois
brick
is
not
a
reason
to
cut
off
that
standing
here,
as
general
olson
indicated,
for
the
following
reason.
illinois
brick
applies
when
hanover
shoe
applies,
and
hanover
shoe
does
not
apply
here.
illinois
brick
is
just
the
flip
side
of
hanover
shoe.
hanover
shoe
says
that
in
a
case
of
a
price-fixing
overcharge...
the
same
as
in
utilicorp...
price-fixing
overcharge...
when
a
middle
man
pays
too
much,
the
middle
man
is
entitled
to
sue
under
the
sherman
act
for
the
entire
amount
of
the
price-fixing
overcharge,
and
the...
and
the
defendant
can't
assert
a
pass-through
defense.
and...
and
the
reason
for
that
is
to
ensure
full
and
effective
use
and
enforcement
of
the
sherman
act's
damages
remedy.
now,
in
that
situation,
what
illinois
brick
holds
is
that,
well,
once
the...
once
the
middle
man
has
sued
for
the
full
value
of
the
overcharge,
then
the
people
subsequently
down
the
chain
can't
bring
antitrust
claims
themselves
because
that
would
create
a
problem
of
duplicative
recovery.
but
the...
but
the
reason
that
you
don't
have...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that...
well,
that's
correct,
but
there
were...
because
he
could
sue
and
there
will
be
problems
of
duplicative
recovery.
but
that...
it
only
applies,
justice
scalia,
in
situations
where
the
measure
of
damages
that
the
middle
man
would
have
is
the
overcharge
damages.
and
here,
of
course,
at&t
is
a
competitor
of
verizon.
at&t
would
bring
a
monopolization
claim,
and
it's
been
clear
since
the
southern
photo
case
in
1927
that
at&t's
measure
of
damages
would
be
its
lost
profits,
not
an
overcharge,
but
its
lost
profits.
and...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
correct.
in
fact,
it
would
disserve
the
very
policies
of
hanover
shoe
here
because
it
would
result
in
the...
the
monopolist
not
being
responsible
for
the
full
value
of
the
antitrust
injury
it
inflicts.
so
there's
no
illinois
brick
problem
here.
and
i
think
that's
why
my
friends
on
the
other
side
in
verizon
relied
so
much
on
associated
general
counsel...
associated
general
contractors
rather
than
illinois
brick.
but,
of
course,
all
that
case
states,
as...
as
this
court
made
clear
in
holmes,
is
a
rule
of
proximate
cause.
and
remember
the
facts
in
associated
general
contractors.
the
allegation
was
that
a
landowner
pressured
a
contractor
to
hire
non-union
subcontractors,
and
as
a
result
the
union
subcontractors
had
less
business,
and
as
a
result,
they
had
fewer
employees,
and
as
a
result,
the
union
had
fewer
dues
to
collect.
and
the
court
quite
properly
held
that
proximate
causation
can't
possibly
extend
that
far.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
means
by
which
verizon
was
trying
to
monopolize
the
market,
as
the
complaint
alleges...
and
i
think
this
is
clear
from
paragraphs
1
and
2
and
54
of
the
amended
complaint...
was
that
it
was...
verizon
was
using
its
control
of
the
local
loop
that
competitors
needed
to
lease
to
get
service
going
to
degrade
the
service
that
its
competitors,
including
at&t,
were
able
to
provide
to
customers.
that
was
the
means
by
which
the...
the
antitrust
scheme
was
effectuated,
and
as
a
result...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think...
you
know,
remember...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i...
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
but
the...
but
the
complaint...
one
of
the
difficulties
of
this
case,
of
course,
is
that
we're
here
on
a
complaint
and
the
test
under
rule
8
is
a
notice
pleading
test,
and
it
can...
and
the
complaint
can
only
be
dismissed
if
there
is
no
conceivable
set
of
facts
that
could
be
proved
consistent
with
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
would
support
relief.
and...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the...
i
think
paragraph
2
of
the
amended
complaint
says
that
bell
atlantic
deterred
and
will
continue
to
deter
potential
customers
from
switching
to
another
company
for
local
phone
service
or
cause
customers
that
switch
back
to
bell
atlantic
in
frustration
for
the
poor
services
rendered
by
their
local
phone
service
provider.
there
are
other
places
in
the
complaint
where
it's
specifically
alleged
that
the
quality
of
service
that
at&t
customers
get
and
other
competitors'
customers
get
is
degraded
in
comparison
to...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
the
right
answer
to
let
them
recover,
and...
and
it's
not
speculative.
they...
their...
the...
this
conduct
directly
raises
the
cost
of...
and
degrades
the
service
that
consumers
in
the
market
receive.
and
they
are
entitled
under
reiter
against
sonotone
to
sue
for
the
damages
that
those
occur.
and
it...
you
know,
illinois
brick...
i'm
not
here
to
defend
the
wisdom
of
illinois
brick
in
the
context
in
which
it
exists,
justice
breyer,
but
it
has
been
narrowly
confined
to
that
context.
and...
and
if
you
don't
have
an
overcharge
case,
you
don't
have
hanover
shoe.
if
you
don't
have
hanover
shoe,
you
don't
have
illinois
brick.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
under...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
first,
paragraph
2,
which
is
at
page...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
but
what
it
says,
justice
breyer,
is
that
they
degraded
service.
well,
the...
the
degraded
service
has
to
occur
not
only
during
the...
the
process
of
switching
over,
but
after
the
switching
over,
and
of
course,
under
swierkiewicz
and
under
leatherman,
the
test
here
is
whether
there's
any
set
of
facts
that
could
be
proved
consistent
with
these
notice
pleading
allegations
that
would
support
a
cause
of
action.
and
i
think
your
honor's
question
proves
that
there
is,
the
first
set
of
facts
that
your
honor
described.
so...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
i
think
those
complaints
are
fairly
construed
to...
to
include
denial...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
it's
true
about
paragraph
52.
i
think
it's
true
about
paragraph
54.
i
think
that
that
is
the
essence
of
the
complaint
here.
and
of
course,
that
makes
sense
because
these
are
exactly
the
kinds
of
allegations...
this
is...
this
is
the
way
monopolization
occurs.
this
is
the
way
maintaining
monopoly
power
occurs
in
this...
in
this
arena.
there's
a
long
and
unfortunate
history
that
goes
back
to
mci
against
at&t
and
continuing...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
to
this
present
day.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
what
it...
what
it
says...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i...
i
don't...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
do.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think...
well,
i
think
you
do
have
an
obligation
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
i'll
try
to
get
to
that
as
fast
as
i
can.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
because
this
says...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
at
page
46
of
the
joint
appendix,
paragraph
54
of
the
amended
complaint.
what
it
alleges
is
that
at&t
and
other
competitors
weren't
able
to
provide
service
at
the...
at
the
level
of
quality...
provide
service
at
the
level
of
quality
that...
that
verizon
could.
it
doesn't
only
say
that
they
weren't
able
to
provide
service
at
all.
it
says
both
of
those
things.
and
so
i
think
the
allegation
is
there
in
54,
and
i
think
the...
and
it's
described
in
the...
the
overview,
1
and
2.
and
paragraphs
1
and
2
of
the
amended
complaint
explains
how
it
works.
and
i'd
like
to...
if
i
could,
go
to...
to
the
core
antitrust
issue
here.
i
think
it
is
common
ground
with
my
friends
on
the
other
side
that
a
monopolist's
right
to
refuse
to
deal
with
competitors
is
not
an
unqualified
right.
they
acknowledge
one
qualification.
that's
where
the
monopolist
discriminates.
they
argue
that's
the
only
time
a
section
2
duty
ought
to
be
imposed
because
that...
in
that
situation
you
can
be
confident
that
it's
anti-competitive
conduct,
and
you
won't
have
problems
with
dampening
incentives
and
you
won't
have
administrability
problems
because
you
can
refer
back
to
the
prior
course
of
dealing.
but
where
they're
wrong
is
in
suggesting
that
that's
the
only
time
that
you
can
find
liability
under
section
2
for
monopolist
refusal
to
cooperate
with
its
rivals.
it
is
equally
true
in
this
case,
in
this
situation
where,
as
justice
kennedy,
your
question
earlier
indicated,
there
is
a
regulatory
regime
in
place
that
requires
competitive
access
on
the
part
of
the
monopolist
in
order
to
bring
competition
into
the
market.
and
what
you
have...
and...
and
i
think
these
allegations
are
consistent
that...
what
i
am
about
to
say
is
consistent
with
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
and
what
you
have
is
a
course
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
monopolist
that
is
intended
to
subvert
the
competitive
entry
that
those
regulations
require.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
wouldn't
put
it
quite
that
way,
your
honor,
but
i...
and
i
will
answer
your...
your
honor's
question
directly.
the...
the
test,
under
the
sherman
act,
for
exclusionary
conduct
applies
in
the
same
way
that...
it's
the
exact
same
test
whether
the
'96
act
is
there
or
not.
the
test
is
whether
the
conduct
impairs
rivals'
opportunities
to
compete
in
the
market
and
whether
the...
the
conduct
does
or
does
not
further...
by
the
monopolist
further
competition
on
the
merits.
that
test
would
apply
to
a
different
factual
scenario
after
the
1996
act
was
passed
than
before.
and
it's
clear
that
that
must
be
the
case.
for
example,
your
honor,
one
thing
that
the
1996
act
did...
this
is
section
253
of
the
act,
which
i
think
is
at
page
90
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
it
eliminated,
preempted
state
monopoly
franchises.
now,
prior
to
passage
of
the
1996
act,
if...
if
trinko
went
to
sue...
bring
a
section
2
claim
against
a
local
telephone
provider
in
a
state
where...
where
there
was
a
monopoly
franchise
law,
trinko
would
be
out
of
court
on
the
state
action
doctrine.
there
would
be
an
ironclad
defense.
well,
section
253
of
the
act
preempted
the
defense.
so
obviously
in
that
situation,
there
is
an
antitrust
claim
that
wasn't
there
before,
and
so
it
can't
be
the
case
that
what...
that...
that
the
passage
of
the
1996
act
has
no
relevance
whatsoever
to
the
application
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
and
indeed,
we
think
it
would
impermissibly...
it
would
violate
the
savings
clause
and
impermissibly
modify
the
applicability
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
conclude
that
the
1996
act
is
the
sole
remedy
here
for
a
person
in
trinko's
position.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter,
because
the...
the
statute
says
that
nothing
shall
modify
the...
modify,
impair,
or
supersede
the
applicability
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it...
the
exact
same
test
applies
before
the
act
was
enacted
and
after,
so
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
modify
the
substantive
antitrust
rule
one
iota.
what
it
changes
is
the
facts
to
which
the
rule
applies.
now,
in
this
case
it
would
not
be
true...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
yes,
in
the
following
sense,
justice
souter.
but
i
don't
think
it
constitutes
a
modification
of
the
applicability
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
might
change
the
result
under
the
antitrust
laws,
but
not
modify
the
applicability
because
the
general
rule
under
the
antitrust
laws
is
that
one
takes
the
regulatory
context
into
account,
and
the
fact
that
conduct
violates
extrinsic
norms,
and
in
particular,
when
it
violates,
as
it
did
in
mci
v.
at&t
and
in
the
litton
systems
case
and
the
court...
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals,
when
it
violates
extrinsic
norms
that
are
designed
to
promote
competition,
that
counts
against
the...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
that's...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
they...
i...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
that...
i
don't
think
that's
quite
right,
justice
kennedy,
and
let
me
try
to
explain
why.
the
test
is
whether
the
monopolist's
conduct
prevents
competition,
obstructs
competition,
whether
it
does
so
on
a
basis
other
than
competition
on
the
merits,
and
whether
it
is...
there's
otherwise
a
legitimate
business
justification.
that's
the
general
rule,
as
the
united
states
acknowledges
at
page
14
of
its
complaint.
that's
the
rule
that
was
applied
in
aspen,
the
rule
that
was
applied
in
kodak.
that's
the
rule.
that
rule
applies
here.
when
one
answers
the
first
part
of
that
test
that...
which
is
does
the
monopolist's
conduct
obstruct
competition,
the...
the...
it's
not
the
case
that
any
violation
of
the
1996
act
would
obstruct
competition.
what
has
to
be
shown
there
is
that
the
monopolist's
conduct
is
sufficiently
grave,
sufficiently
serious,
sufficiently
sustained
that
it...
that
it
amounts
to
an
overall
pattern
that
obstructs
competition.
so
it's
not
the
case
that
there
is
a...
that...
that
there's
a...
an
automatic
transference
of
a...
of
a
duty
under
the
1996
act
into
an
antitrust
duty.
but
where
the...
where
the
1996
act
becomes
relevant
is
when
you
get
to
the
next
stage
of
the
inquiry.
and
i
think...
and
it's
just
what
your
honor
said
earlier.
at
that
stage
in
the
inquiry,
it
is...
the
monopolist
does
not
have
open
to
it
the
argument
that
this
is
pro-competitive
behavior
and
that
i
have
a
legitimate
business
justification
for
it
because
in
that
circumstance,
it
is
unlawful
to
do
it.
and
so
it
can't
be
a
legitimate
business
justification
to
say
i
don't
want
to
do
something
that
the
law
compels
me
to
do
because
i'll
be
better
off
as
a
competitive
matter
if
i
don't
do
it.
so
it
does
enter
the
analysis.
it's
not
irrelevant
by
any
means.
but
it
doesn't
transform
or
change
in
any
way
the
antitrust
standard.
but
it...
it
does
have
this...
this
additional
effect...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think...
i
think
it
does
say
that
this
is
conduct
that
it...
that
it...
i
think
you
can
no
longer
say
that
it
is...
that
it
is
consistent
with
competition
on
the
merits
for
a
monopolist
to
refuse
to
cooperate
when
a
law
designed
to
promote
competition
insists
on
the
cooperation.
so
i
think
in
that
way,
i
agree
with
your
honor,
that's
what's
happening
here.
and
then
the
other
thing
that's
critical
is
that...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i...
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
why
is
this.
because
i
think
that
question...
if
i
may
say
so,
i
think
it
picks
up
on
what
i
believe
to
be
a
false
choice
that
my
friends
on
the
other
side
are
presenting,
and
that's
a
choice
between,
on
the
one
hand,
a...
a
duty
to
deal
relegated
solely
to
the
circumstance
of
discrimination
and,
on
the
other
hand,
a
wholly
unqualified
duty
to
deal
that...
that
might
raise
a
lot
of
the
problems
that
your
honor
has
identified.
but
there's
a
middle
ground
here,
and
it's
the
middle
ground
that
i...
that
i
submit
to
your
honor
that...
that
professor
areeda
identified
in
a
1989
article
and
that
makes
a
world
of
sense.
and
that
is,
when
there
is
a
regulatory
regime
in
place
that
supplies
the
background
norms,
then
the
juries
don't
answer
those
questions.
the
juries
decide
something
very
different.
what
the
juries
will
decide
in
that
set
of
circumstances
is
whether
the
regulatory
requirements
have
been
violated
or
not,
and
they'll
also...
and...
and
remember,
many
of
these
regulatory
requirements
are
contractual
terms.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
it
is...
it's
an
obvious
defense
in
a
case
like
this
for...
for
an
incumbent
to
say,
well,
i'm...
i'm
in
compliance
with
the
law
and
i'm
in
compliance
with
my
contractual
obligations.
i
think
it's
also
a
defense
for
an
incumbent,
as
it
was
in
the
mci
v....
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
i...
i
think
the
answer
is
if
it
can't
be
resolved
on
summary
judgment...
of
course,
matsushita
says
that
summary
judgment
has
a
particularly
important
role
to
play
in
antitrust
cases,
but
if
it
can't,
then...
then
it
will
go
to
the
jury.
but
that's
really
not
any
different...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
you
do
because
the
way
this
is
going
to...
what
we're
talking
about
here,
your
honor,
is...
is
something
very
different.
there
might
be
a
contractual
provision,
for
example,
that
says
you've
got
to
cut
over
the
loops
from
your
own
switching
system
to
our
switching
system
within
an
average
of
6
days.
now,
if
a
plaintiff
were
able
to
come
into
court
and
show,
well,
you
know,
the
contract
says
6
days,
but
actually
it's
taken
them
6
months
and
as
a
result,
we're
being
disabled,
that's
not
anything
different
than
what...
what
an
antitrust
court
and
what
an
antitrust
jury
is
asked
to
decide
in
any
case.
these
antitrust
cases
are
complex.
there's
no
getting
around
that.
they...
but...
but
they
go
to
a
jury
if
there's
a
dispute
of
fact.
there's
no
getting
around
that
either.
and
this
is
no
different
from
any
other
one
in
those
respects.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
there
would
be...
i
think
there
would
be
claims
of
both
kinds
possible
certainly
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
the...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
also
governed
by
the
same
set
of
regulatory
norms,
and
it
takes
away...
it...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i...
well,
i
think
there
might
be
some
circumstances,
your
honor,
in
which
it
will
be
a
harder
case
to
make,
and
that
might
be
a
case
where
a
judge
could
appropriately
say,
it's
too
complicated,
it
can't
go
to
the
jury,
or
might
appropriately
say,
this
is
a
matter
for
primary
jurisdiction.
but
it
is
not
a
black
and
white
situation
in
which
the...
the
right
answer
here
is
to
cut
off
an
antitrust
remedy
that
congress
clearly
envisioned
when
it
enacted
that
savings
clause.
congress
enacted
the
savings
clause
to
make
clear
that
antitrust
was
to
operate
in
conjunction
with
the
regulatory
regimes
here,
and
with
all
due
respect...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
that
it
is
a
concern,
but
it
is
not
a
concern
that
defeats
standing
for
the
reasons
i
gave
earlier,
and
it
is
a
concern
that
can
be
overcome
through
the
normal
processes
of
discovery
under
the
federal
rules.
and...
and
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
substantive
antitrust
claim
that's
before
the
court...
and
in
fact,
the
existence
of
the
regulatory
regime
solves
the
problems.
it
sets
the
benchmarks.
it
functions
as
a
benchmark
in
just
the
same
way
that
a
prior
course
of
dealing
would
function
as
a
benchmark
in
a
discrimination
case,
and...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i...
i
think
the
answer
is,
your
honor,
because
in...
in
the
absence
of
an
effort
by
a...
an
entity,
a
competitor,
to
use
the
mechanisms
that
the
act
put
in
place,
then
that...
in
that
situation,
the
entity
doesn't
have
an
antitrust
claim
where
they
could
show
exclusionary
conduct
based
on
subversion
on
the
regulatory
requirements
and
lack
of
a
legitimate
business
justification
based
on
refusal
to
abide
by
the
regulatory
requirements
because
they
haven't
invoked
the
regulatory
requirements.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
right,
but
that's
a
far...
but...
but
i
think
that's
a
far
different
situation
from
the
one
that
judge
wood
described.
and
i
think
it's
important,
critically
important,
here
to
understand
where
the
regulators
are
on
that
very
question.
the
regulators
don't
think
there's
interference
if
there's
mutual
enforcement.
it's
notable
that
the
federal
communications
commission
is
not
on
the
brief
for
the
united
states
and
the
federal
trade
commission
today
and
that's
because
their
position,
which
is
articulated
in
orders
which
we
cite
in
the
footnote
page
38
of
our
brief,
is
that
the
duties
that
they
impose,
the...
the
access
duties
and
specific
obligations,
ought
to
be
enforced
under
the
antitrust
laws
as
well
as
under
the...
as
well
as
under
the
telecommunications
act
and
that...
and
that...
you
know,
the
lessons
of
history
are
behind
that
and
the
lessons
of
common
sense
are
behind
that.
the
fact
is
that
the
regulatory
regime
that
the
fcc
tried
to
put
in
place
to
bring
long
distance
competition
and
to
bring
telephone
equipment
competition
was
insufficient,
standing
on
its
own
with
all
of
those
regulatory
mechanisms,
to
make
that
competition
occur.
that
competition
occurred
only
when
vigorous
antitrust
enforcement
was
brought
to
bear
in
part
to
enforce
those
very
regulatory
requirements.
and
that
makes
a
great
deal
of
common
sense,
of
course,
because
the
incumbents
in
this
situation
have
every
incentive
in
the
world
for
this
system
not
to
work
because
they
want
to
retain
as
many
customers
as
they
can
and
they
want
to
make
as
much
money
as
they
can,
and
they
have
ample
ability
to
do
it.
there's
a
thousand
ways
in
which
they
could
subvert
this...
this
regulatory
regime
by...
with...
with
using
low-level,
low-intensity
obstructionist
conduct
that
history
has
shown
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
regulators
to...
to
capture
and
prevent.
and
that
is
why
antitrust
law
needs
to
apply
here.
it's
why
the
fcc
says
it
should
apply.
it's
why
the
15
states
who
have
submitted
a
brief
in
support
of
our
position
on
this
said
it
should
apply
because
that's
the
only
way,
operating
in
tandem,
that
we're
going
to
get
to
the
competition
that
congress
tried
to
bring
about.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
is
exactly
why
the
savings
clause
is
in
the
1996
act.
thank
you.
