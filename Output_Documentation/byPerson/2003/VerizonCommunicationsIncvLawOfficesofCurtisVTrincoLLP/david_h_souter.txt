david
h.
souter
okay,
and
if...
if
there
hadn't
been
an
agreement,
at&t
would
go
where?
to
the
commission?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
that
effort
gives
trinko
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
trinko
sue...
does
trinko
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
on
the...
just
on
the
facts
pleaded,
do
you
take...
does
the
united
states
take
the
position
that...
that
trinko
has
pleaded
a
cause
of
action
under
202
or
any
other
section
of
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
dispute
that
he
has
pleaded
a
cause
of
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
as
long
as
the
consumer
can
bring
an
action
for
something
that
at&t
couldn't
bring,
no
illinois...
no
hanover,
no
illinois
brick.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
modifying
it
either
way,
aren't
you?
i
mean,
you're
modifying
it
if
you
say
sole
remedy.
you're
modifying
it
if...
if
it
gives,
in
the
chief
justice's
words,
momentum.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
modification
either
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
momentum
theory,
in
effect,
says
the
applicability
is
being
modified
because
there's
a
declaration
of
certain
anti-competitive
conduct.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
you
were
invoking
the
act
for
the
characterization
of
those
facts
as
anti-competitive.
