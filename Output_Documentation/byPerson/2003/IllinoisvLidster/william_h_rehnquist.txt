20...
02-1060,
illinois
v.
robert
s.
lidster.
mr.
feinerman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
about...
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr....
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
road...
roadblock
that
you
find
in
perhaps
some
smaller
towns
where
the
police
just
very
briefly
stop
you
and
ask
you
to
contribute
to
the
police
boys
fund.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
feinerman.
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
ramsell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
that
there
is
a
roadblock
but
the
only
purpose
of
the
roadblock
is
the
police
are
stopping
people
to
see
if
they'll
contribute
to
the
police
boys
fund.
the
same
thing...
exactly
the
same
thing
happens
with
that
roadblock
has
happened
with
your
client.
he
comes
up,
almost
hits
the
policeman,
smells
alcohol
on
his
breath
and
so
forth,
he's
charged
with
drunken
driving
and
is
convicted.
does
he
have
a
fourth
amendment
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
can
hold
him
up
for
2
hours
if
they're
collecting
for
the
police
boys
fund
but
they
can't
hold
him
up
for
10
or
15
seconds
if
they're
trying
to
solve
a
crime?
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
maybe
television
won't
cover
just
a
blurb
put
out
by
the
police
where
they
will
cover
a
roadblock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that...
that
happens
in
a
lot
of
other
contexts
too.
you
can
be
driving
on
a
highway,
all
of
a
sudden
everything
comes
to
a
stop.
what's
the
matter?
is
it
an
accident?
are
they
having
one-lane
repair?
and
you
just
don't
know,
i
mean,
that's
part
of
the
condition
of
driving.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
even...
even
if
it
were,
say,
a
carjacking,
where
there
was
a
fatality,
if
it's
stale
it
can't
be
done?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if
you've
got
a...
a
license
number
and
for...
for
a
serious
crime
that
was
committed,
say,
an
hour
ago?
can...
can
you
then
conduct
a...
this
sort
of
program?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course...
well,
what
if
you...
what
if
you
just
had
the
information
that
it's...
it's
a
black
ford
suv?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
people
in
lombard
care
about
it,
they
can
tell
the
police
to
stop
doing
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
prouse
was
random
stops,
though,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ramsell.
mr.
feinerman,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feinerman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1060,
illinois
against
lidster
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
