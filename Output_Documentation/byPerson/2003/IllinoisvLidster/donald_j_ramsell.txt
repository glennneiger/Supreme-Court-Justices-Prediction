mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
mass,
suspicionless
seizure
of
innocent
citizens
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
ordinary
criminal
wrongdoing
without
exigent
circumstances
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
indianapolis
v.
edmond
is
the
controlling
precedent.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
justice
breyer,
by
definition
this
is
a
seizure.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
it
remains
unreasonable
for
a
number
of
matters.
it's
the
aggregate
of
the
circumstances
then
by
which
other
innocent
persons
could
be
seized.
it's
the
fact
that
the
gravity
of
the
public
concern
in
this
particular
event
is
far
less
than
the
reasonableness...
reasonableness
factors
that
have
been
used
in
sitz.
it's
far
less
than
the
immigration
factor
that
was
found
in
martinez
v.
fuerte.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
it's
midnight.
you're
on
a
road
where
you
do
not
expect
to
be
confronted
by
a
police
officer.
you're
waiting
in
line
for
several
minutes
as
various
other
cars
are
evidently
being
interrogated,
some
are
being
transferred
to
secondary
staging
areas.
the
anxiety
builds
and
you
arrive
at
the
front
of
the
roadblock
to
be
questioned
about
where
you
were
last
week,
personal
indications,
what
have
you
seen?
you
feel
compelled
to
answer.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
detective
vasil
testified
that
they
were
stopped,
given
a
flyer,
but
also
asked
if
they
had
been
in
the
area
last
week
and
if
they
had
seen
anything
unusual.
that
second
phase
was
relatively
interrogational,
although
field
interrogational.
nevertheless,
it
is
somewhat
intrusive
on
what
are
considered
some
of
our
privacy...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
be
a
seizure,
so
the
fourth
amendment
is
implicated.
however,
applying
the
edmond
analysis,
the
programmatic
purpose
of
that
seizure
not
being
in
the
investigation
or
detection
of
crime,
i
would
submit
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i...
i
would
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
if
you
were
to
stop
a
person
and
seize
them
for
no
reason
whatsoever
that
that
would
not
survive
a
fourth
amendment
analysis.
ten
to
15
seconds
to
deliver
some
funds
and
put
them
in
a
can
would
certainly
be
reasonable
for
that
beneficent,
non-crime
control
purpose.
two
hours
would
certainly
exceed...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
compulsive
collection
would
be
questionable.
that
would
seem
to
be
a
tax.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
but
we
do...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
it...
it
is
often
difficult
to
say
no
when...
when
a
fireman
is
seeking
some
funds.
however,
it
is
certainly
not
the
detection
or
investigation
of
the
crime,
and
the
analysis
that
would
take
place
there
would
be
different,
and
certainly
2
hours
to
put
money
in
a
can
would
suggest
that
the
scope
and
duration
of
that
stop
was
far
beyond
what
was
reasonable.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
it
is
considered
a
voluntary
encounter
to
the
extent
that
if
you
choose
to
open
the
door
and
engage
in
that
conversation
the
fourth
amendment
isn't
even
implicated
there.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
there's
the
difference
between
the
voluntary
consensual
encounter
and
what
we
have
in
this
case
was
clearly
involuntary.
they
even
had
an
officer...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
would
suggest
that
the
fact
that
an
innocent
motorist
would
feel
that
he
or
she
was
unreasonable
by
not
cooperating
suggests
the
compulsive
aspects
of
this
scenario,
make
it
more
of
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
more
unreasonable
to
that
extent.
one...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
in...
in
a
general
sense,
yes.
of
course,
there
would
be
other
factors
involved,
but
child
abductions
generally
fall
within
the
exigent
circumstance
analysis.
clearly
there
would
likely
have
to
be
further
evaluation
of
the
facts
behind
why
they
felt
that...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
first
off,
the
child
abduction
is
a
continuing
crime,
to
the
extent
that
the
need
for
action
in
order
to
prevent
the
passable
future
or
immediate
harm
to
that
child,
makes
that
an
exigent
circumstance
by
itself.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
as
we
had
in
sitz
with
the
imminent
hazard
of
drunk
drivers,
if
there
were
such
a
thing
as
a
serial
hit-and-run
driver,
the
imminency,
the
exigency
would
be
suggested
within
that
hypothetical,
and
so
i
believe
that
it
would
be
more
reasonable
under
that
circumstance,
but
what
we...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
that
had
recently
occurred?
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
again,
if
there
was...
if
it
was
very
fresh,
and
the
more
fresh
it
is
the
more
reasonable
it
tends
to
become
under
a
simply
an
exigency
analysis,
the
fresher
the
crime
the
more
believability...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
if
they
had
some
independent
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
person
was
still
in
the
area,
that
may
have
been
a
different
set
of
facts.
commonwealth
v.
burns
was
an
example
of
a
informational
roadblock
where
they
had
independent
evidence
to
believe
that
the
murderer
was
still
in
the
area.
i
believe
that
was
2
days
later.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
the
exigency
of
the
circumstances
would
certainly
authorize
more...
a
possible
information
roadblock
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
justice
o'connor,
my
understanding
is
that
the
roadblock
itself
was
entirely
ineffective.
it
had
zero
effectiveness
in
seeking
to
obtain
information
regarding
this
event.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
we've
just
heard
that
it
was
the
television
which
led
to
some
information,
which
is
a
standard
police
practice,
does
not
implicate
the
fourth
amendment,
does
not
require
any
seizure
of
innocent
persons...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
believe
that
in
the
television
context
there's
no
roadblock
at
issue
and
no
one's
even
compelled
to
watch
the
television...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
that
may
or
may
not
be
true,
your
honor,
but
there
are...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
that
would...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
that
would
certainly
be
very
boring
to...
to
watch
wanted
posters,
certainly
if
they
were
repetitious...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
to
be
frank,
searching
the
record
it's...
it's
relatively
unclear.
my
understanding
is
90
minutes
to
2
hours
at
most.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
yes,
it
was
at
night.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
that
would
also
be
equally
as
difficult,
your
honor.
i...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
logic
would
seem
to
dictate
that
by
the
time
the
person
received
the
flyer
and
drove
away
they
would
again
be
away
from
the
scene
of
the
event
before
they
even
read
the
flyer,
which
also
makes
it
somewhat
ineffective
in
that
regard.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
to...
to
take...
to
take
the
10
to
15
seconds
detective
vasil
describes
as
the
duration
of
handing
the
flyer,
asking
two
questions,
and
obtaining
two
answers,
it
would
seem
that
reading
the
flyer
would
have
had
to
have
occurred
sometime
after
the
seizure.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
see.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
it
did
have
some...
it...
it
indicated
the...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
yes.
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
and
it's
located
on
page
9
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
there
is...
there
is
a
great
amount
of
detail
that's
in
that
flyer,
certainly
would
suggest
it
would
be
difficult
for
one
to
read
the
entirety
of
it,
understand
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
even
being
stopped
that
evening,
which
is
another
point.
there
was
no
advance
signs,
unlike
sobriety
checkpoints,
where
as
you're
arriving,
and
even
before
you
have
contact
with...
with
the
police
officers,
there's
a
sign
that
says,
warning,
sobriety
checkpoint
ahead.
at
least
you're
putting...
you're
put
on
notice
what
it
is
that's
taking
place
in
front
of
you.
here,
people
are
waiting
in
line
having
no
idea
what
it
is...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
certainly
we
have
to
expect
that
we'll
be
stopped
more
often
than
anyone
would
wish
in
that
context,
but
it...
it's
quite
different
when
you
are...
when
there's
six
to
twelve
emergency
vehicles
there
and
as
you
get
closer
and
closer
you
see
this
encounter
taking
place
before
you
with
every
single
motorist
in
front
of
you.
that
raises
the
anxiety
of
even
the...
the
most
innocent
citizen,
i
would
suggest.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
my
understanding
of
this
location,
being
familiar
with
the
area,
is
that
it's
a
major
thoroughfare
with...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
multiple
lanes.
it
would
be
highly
unlikely
at
midnight
that
any
pedestrian
would
or
should
be
walking
on
the
shoulder
of
this
high
speed
limit...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
no.
there
are
rarely
sidewalks
in
our
town,
unfortunately.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
i
believe
that
law
enforcement
is
always
appreciative
of
any
techniques
or
tools
that
they're
allowed
to
use
for
investigatory
purposes.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
would
believe
that
it
would
be
more...
more
likely
for
abuse
if
this
court
were
to
suggest
that
these
type
of
roadblocks
were
a
valid
investigative
tool.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
because
it
would
simply,
number
one,
it
is...
it
makes
for
great
publicity
for
law
enforcement
to
use
these
roadblocks.
they
feel
that
it's
a...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
and...
i
agree,
even
though
statistically
roadblock
sobriety
checkpoints
tend
to
be
far
less
effective
than
saturation
patrols.
most
police
chiefs
comment
that
they
don't
get
the
type
of
publicity
they
receive
from
a
roadblock
that
they
get
from
saturation
patrols.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
would
suggest
the
programmatic
purpose,
the
primary
programmatic
purpose
employed
in
edmond
would
still
remain
that
this
was
for
the
purpose
of
crime
detection
and
investigation,
not
for
simply
checking
licenses.
the
same...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
and
i...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
justice
scalia,
i
would
suggest
the
programmatic
purpose,
which
would
be
a
question
of
intent,
would
still
remain
that
it
was
truly
for
the
investigation
of
this
particular
crime
and
certainly
the
duration
and
the
scope
of
the
seizure
would
exceed
the
license
check
when
questions
were
being
asked
about
whether
you
had
been
here
last
week,
whether
you
had
seen
anything
regarding
a
hit-and-run
or
any
other
crime.
that
would
seem
to
exceed
even
the
suggested
appropriateness
of
a
roadblock
for
license
checks
in
prouse.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
know
that
a...
a
far
greater
number
have
been
reported
since
sitz,
but
i
cannot
confess
to
knowing
what
the
statistics
or
the
record-keeping
was
prior
to
sitz,
but
it
has...
it
has
now
crept
into
the
american
psyche
that
roadblocks
are
a...
a
regular
way
of
life.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
no.
when
the...
when
the
case
was
remanded
to
michigan,
michigan
found
under
their
own
state
constitution
that
this...
that
a
sobriety
checkpoint
still
remained
to
be
an
unreasonable
violation
of
the
search
and
seizure
clause
of
their
own
constitution,
so
they
do
not
have
them.
now,
in
this
case,
what
we
have
is
we
have
a...
a
very
stale
event.
in
fact,
the
facts
do
not
even
suggest
that
the
driver
was
perhaps
even
negligent
in
how
the
accident
occurred.
we
have
a...
a
bicyclist
on
a
major
thoroughfare
at
midnight
in
a
place
where
it's
highly
unusual
to...
to
find
pedestrians
in
a
dark
area,
and
there's
been
no
indication
that
the
driver
was
at
fault
other
than
failing
to
remain
at
the
scene
of
the
accident.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
it's
hit-and-run
as...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
the
consequences
are
very
serious.
however,
hit-and-run
would
also
fall
within
dinging
the
car
in
the
grocery
parking
lot
next
to
you
and
failing
to
remain
at
the
scene.
these
are
single
events...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
would
suggest
that
it
cannot
be
done
for
any
crime
except
in
exigent
circumstances,
which
we
do
not
have
here.
this
is
a
stale
event...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
yes,
your
honor.
i
would...
i
would
respectfully
say
that,
under
the
analysis
in
edmonds,
there
is
a
lack
of
exigency.
edmonds
suggests
that,
but
for
the
emergency
circumstances
of
an...
an
imminent
terrorist
attack,
otherwise
that
would
be
considered
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
is
single
accident.
it...
it
does
not
fall
within
the
magnitude
of
any
of
the
previous
issues
that
have
been
brought
before
the
court...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
well,
the
line
is
exigency,
and
exigency
meaning
there
was
no...
there's
an
immediate
hazard
on
the
roadway,
which
was
what
seemed
to
justify
sobriety
checkpoints
in
sitz,
that
there
would
have
been
an
effectiveness
to
removing
then-hazardous
drivers
and
preventing
the
potential
for
future
injury
to
life
and
limb.
this
is
a
post-event,
non-exigent
roadblock.
the
facts,
nevertheless,
don't
have
the
gravity
of
the
public
concern.
in
the
brown
v.
texas...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
would
submit
yes,
that
you
could
under
that
circumstance.
number
one,
you
could
tailor
the
roadblock
substantially
less.
you
have
the
exigency
because
it
is
a
fresh
pursuit
analysis.
you
certainly
wouldn't
need
to
pull
over
every
car
and
question
them
if
you
had
a
license
plate
number
to
work
from.
and
so
it...
it
would
certainly
even
be
capable
of
being
more
sufficiently
tailored
so
that
those
who
are
admittedly
innocent
are
less
likely
to
have
their
liberties
interfered
with.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
and
it
happened
one
hour
ago?
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
believe
under
that
set
of
circumstances
the
exigency
would
suggest
there
would
be
a
potential
for
a
reasonable
checkpoint
tailored
in
scope
and
duration
with
sufficient
guidelines
in
place.
in
fact,
in
this
particular
checkpoint,
we
have
virtually
no
guidelines
in
place.
we
have
a
field
officer
who
testifies
that
what
he
did
was
to
ask
some
questions.
there's
no
indication
as
to
why
other
persons
were
sent
to
secondary
staging
areas.
we
do
not
have
any
guidelines
so
that
if
a
motorist
had
said,
yes,
i
was
here
last
week,
and
yes,
i
think
i
have
some
information,
we
have
no
guidelines
for
those
field
officers
as
to
what
to
do
and
how
to
treat
that
motorist
and
how
to
detain
that
person.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
do
believe
there
are...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
do...
there...
i
do
believe
there
are
people
who
care
and
there
are
people
who
care
about
our
right
to
be
let
alone,
our
right
of
free
passage.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
certainly
would
hope
that
they
would
also
exercise
their
right
to
let
them
know
that
they
dislike
these
roadblocks
as
much
as
perhaps
others
in
more
intellectual
pursuits,
but...
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i
would
suggest
that
most...
most
persons
are
not
pleased
by
roadblocks.
i
believe
that
most
people
feel
that
they
do
reflect
on
an
invasion
of
their
privacy
and
liberty.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
i...
i
cannot
cite
any
polling
that's
been
taken
one
way
or
the
other
that
would
really
flesh
that
out.
here
we
have
far
less
than
the
drug
interdiction
that
was
rejected
in
edmond.
we
have
a
single
accident.
we
have
far
less
than
the
concern
about
protecting
our
national
borders,
as
we
had
in
martinez
v.
fuerte,
and
certainly
not
the
imminency
of
the
hazard
that
was
found
in
sitz.
there's
frankly
no
empirical
or
actual
data
to
even
support
that
this
roadblock
will
advance
the
interest,
and
by
the
fact
that
nothing
was
advanced
in
this
particular
event
suggests
that
even
in
a
balancing
test
we
don't
have
the
sufficiency,
the
gravity
of
the
public
concern,
nor
do
we
have
any
indication
of
any
degree
to
which
this
seizure
would
advance
the
public
interest.
this
is
more
akin
to
prouse,
where
the
court
found
that
the...
the
likelihood
of
finding
an
unlicenced
motorist
versus
the
likely
numbers
of
persons
that
will
be
stopped
was
so
substantial
that
data
was
insufficient.
mr.
donald
j.
ramsell
it
was
random
stops.
however,
the
effectiveness
was
mentioned
as...
as
one
of
the
factors,
and
there
were
certainly
reasonable
alternatives
that
were
suggested
that
could
have
avoided
the
random
stop
scenario.
and
here
we
have
admittedly
innocent
drivers
as
well
with
no
escape
route,
so
a
person
couldn't
even
avoid
the...
the
compulsory
stop
and
questioning.
i
would
also
submit
that
this
analysis,
if...
if
found
appropriate
here,
would
equally
allow
for
the
stop
of
pedestrians
at...
on
the
sidewalk.
it
would
allow
the
police
to
circle
an
office
building
and
have
the
persons
run
through
the...
with
the
gamut
of
brief
questioning
before
they
were
allowed
to
leave
an
office
building.
and
it
would
be
very
unmanageable
and
unworkable
to
find
an
appropriate
balancing
test,
even
though
i
would
submit
that
one
thing
the
court
needs
to
do
is
to,
of
course,
let
law
enforcement
know
in
advance
what
will
be
acceptable
conduct
on
their
part
and
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
allow
for
a
case-by-case,
fact-sensitive
analysis
based
on
the
plethora
of
crimes
that
could
potentially
lead
to
it,
the
geographic
area
in
a
small
rural
town.
the
rural
police
chief
may
find
roadblocks
or...
may
find
their
most
serious
crime
to
be
the
stealing
of
a
purse
and
therefore
a
roadblock
of
some
form
justifiable
there,
where
that
same
roadblock
in
an
urban
setting
would
be
found
to
be
unreasonable
and
unjustifiable,
and
certainly
those
politically
accountable
officials
that
feel
that
their
citizenry
are
more
favorable
to
roadblocks
may
be
encouraged
to
allow
them
to
occur
more
often.
thank
you.
