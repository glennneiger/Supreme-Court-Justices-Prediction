justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
that
isn't
enough?
what
if
they...
they're
squandering
their
resources?
you
have
a
dumb
police
chief
who's...
who's
using
most
of
his
resources
in
fruitless
roadblocks.
justice
scalia
what
do
we
do
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what...
that's
what
i'm
asking.
what
makes
this
reasonable
that
wouldn't
make
other
ones
reasonable?
what
would
be
unreasonable?
a...
a
general
roadblock
asking
about
general
crime...
you
know,
sir,
have
you
seen
any
crime
committed
in
the
last
6
months,
something
like
that?
justice
scalia
would
that
be...
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
come
within
that,
but
you
think
that
that
would...
would
be
invalid
even
though
you
would
support
these
informational
roadblocks
in
some
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
kidding.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
would
that
one
be
invalid
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gave
you
the
circumstances.
it's
a
general
roadblock.
they
stop
everybody
who
comes
along
simply
for
the
purpose
of
asking,
sir
or
madam,
have
you
seen
a
crime
committed
within
the
last
6
months?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
circumstances
do
you
need?
whether
it's
raining
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
now,
can
you
give
me...
justice
antonin
scalia
a
yes
or
no?
is
that
good
or
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
they
make
the
pedestrian
stop?
i
mean,
i'm
walking
along,
the
police
says,
excuse
me,
sir,
can
i
ask...
i
say,
no,
i'm
too
busy,
and
i
keep
walking.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
they
arrest
me
for
keeping
on
walking?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
can
they
do
it
with
a
car?
is
that
what
happened
here?
suppose
this
car
were
in
first
gear
as
it
cruised,
you
know,
rolled
up
to
the
roadblock
and
the
same
thing
happened,
the
policeman
said,
i
want
to
ask
you,
you
know,
sir,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
too
busy,
just
keeps
rolling
on
through.
would...
would
he
have
been
arrested
in
this
roadblock?
justice
scalia
he
didn't
stop
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
kept
rolling
at
a
very
slow
speed
and
he
just
told
the
policeman,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
too
busy.
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
do
you
think
he
could
do
the
same
thing
with
a...
with
a
pedestrian?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
suppose
part
of
the
reasonableness
inquiry
has
to
be
what
alternatives
were
available
to
achieve
the
same
objective.
and
why
couldn't
the
police
just
have
had
a
big
sign
on
the
side
of
the
road,
one
of
those,
you
know,
illuminated
signs
that
they
have
now,
which
said,
you
know,
please
help
us,
looking
for
hit-and-run...
justice
antonin
scalia
last
week,
something
like
that.
and
then
those
people
who
are
willing
to
cooperate
could
pull
over
and
cooperate
and
those...
those
who
want
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
can
keep
on
moving.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
applying
the
least...
least
restrictive
means
test,
but
surely
one
of
the...
one
of
the
factors
in
determining
whether
this
was
reasonable
is
whether
you
could
have
done...
achieved
the
same
objective
in...
in
some
other
manner.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wouldn't
have
done
it,
but
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
a
roadblock
is
much
more
fun
to
cover.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
can
you
stop
the
person?
i
mean,
put
it
in
a
pedestrian
context,
do
you
think
a
police
officer
can
insist
that
the
person
stop,
stand
there,
and
listen
to
his
pitch?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
they
been
successful?
is
your
knowledge
of
these
things
profound
enough
that
you
can
say
how
successful
they've
been?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
that
have
been
successful?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fourth
amendment
is
an
anxiety
thing?
my
goodness.
justice
scalia
arrested
or
elected?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
did
you
say
arrested
or
elected?
that
a
lot
of
police
chiefs
are...
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
said
arrested.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
hold
him
up
for
no
reason
at
all,
just
for
a
lark.
hey,
let's
hold
up
a
bunch
of
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
say
that
passes
the
fourth
amendment
test
but
if...
but...
but
this
very
reasonable
investigation
does
not.
that
can't
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe...
maybe
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
question...
i'm
not
sure
that
reasonableness
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
is
the
same
as
reasonableness
in
general.
do
you
think
it
would
be...
in
general,
if
you're
not
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment...
an
unreasonable
thing
for
a
policeman
to
knock
on
your
door
and
say,
excuse
me,
sir,
we're
investigating
a
crime,
we
really
need
your
help,
do
you
mind
if
i...
i
come
in
and
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions
just
to
help
us
solve
this
crime?
do
you
think
that's
reasonable
in...
in...
in
a
sense?
i
guess
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
person
says,
unreasonably
says
no,
and
the
policeman
comes
in
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it
isn't
really
the
policeman
that's
being
unreasonable
in
the
general
sense.
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
unreasonable
for
the
homeowner
to
refuse
to
cooperate
at
all
with
the
police
in
the...
in
the
solving
of
a...
let's
assume
it's
a
major
crime.
that
seems
to
me
unreasonable,
but
even
so,
the
policeman
is
not
allowed
to
come
into
the
home.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
also
here.
it
might
be
very
unreasonable
for
the
person
not
to
want
to
cooperate,
and
it
might
be
quite
reasonable
for
the
policeman
to
seek
the
cooperation,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
answer
the
fourth
amendment
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
this
would
be
different
if
this
was
a
serial
hit-and-run
killer,
right?
he
does
one
a
week.
then...
then
you
think
it'd
be
a
different
situation
and
maybe
they
could
conduct
the...
the
roadblock.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
it
requires
a
roadblock.
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing
duller
than
watching
a
wall
of...
of
wanted
posters,
you
know,
and
now,
for
our
listeners,
we're
going
to
pan
the
wanted
posters
at
the
post
office.
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
going
to
sell.
who's
going
to
sponsor
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
they
had
done
the
same
thing
they
did
here,
the
same
thing,
except
that,
in
addition
to
giving
them
a
flyer
and
asking
them
about
what
happened...
were...
you
know,
were
you
here
a
week
before,
they...
it
was
also
a
check
of
driver
registration?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
were
actually
checking
licenses.
i
mean,
they're...
they're
really
doing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they...
they
pick
up
some
people
who
don't...
don't
have
licenses,
but
while
they're
at
it
they
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone.
and
you
say
it
would
make
it
bad
because
its
primary
purpose
was
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
incremental
point
of
time...
you're
really
playing
with
a...
an
inconsequential...
inconsequential
impingement
upon
the
person's
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
anybody's
that's
challenged
these
things
who...
for
any
reason
other
than
the
exclusionary
rule?
this
case
wouldn't
be
here
except
for
the
fact
that
your
client
during
the
stop
was
found
to
be
driving
under
the
influence.
had
that
not
happened,
don't
you
think
there's
zero
chance
that
anyone
would
have
cared
enough,
would
have
felt
beset
upon
enough
by
the
police
to
bring
some
action
to
stop
this
gestapo-like
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's...
it's
really
just
the
exclusionary
rule
driving...
driving
this
case.
