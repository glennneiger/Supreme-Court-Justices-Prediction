ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
reason
a
news
story
covering
a...
a
hit-and-run
fatality,
as
in
this
case,
is
not
as
effective
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
statistically,
the
majority
of
americans
don't
watch
local
news.
more
importantly,
there
is
significant
value
as...
as
has
long
been
recognized
when
police
deal
with
pedestrians
and
approach
them,
seeking
their
assistance
in
solving
crimes,
there
is
significant
value
to
having
a
police
officer
approach
someone
in
a
one-on-one
manner
in
an
effort
to
solve
a
crime.
first
of
all,
the...
the
approach
impresses
on
people,
who
are
otherwise
very
busy,
the
importance
of
the
matter
before
them
and
that
this
may
be
worth
devoting
their
time.
the
police
officer's
one-on-one
approach
can
advise
the
person,
in
addition,
that
what
you
saw
might
be
significant
even
though
you
didn't
see
an
accident.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
there
is
a
long...
just
there
is
a
long
historic
distinction
between
cars
and
homes,
there's
a
long
historic
distinction
between
cars
and
pedestrians,
and
the
reason...
as
a
practical
matter,
you
have
to
have
a
very,
very
brief
seizure
here
to
protect
the
life
and
limb
of
the
police
officer
while
he
tries
to
make
this
approach.
that's
not
needed
when
you're
approaching
pedestrians.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
what...
what
is
relevant
is
what
this
court
has
long
recognized
is...
is
the
difference
in
your
reasonable
expectations
of
freedom
of
movement
between
people
in
cars
and
pedestrians
on
the
sidewalk.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice
souter,
the
essential
command
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
reasonableness,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
fourth
amendment
that
says
stops
for
sobriety
or
stops
to
see
if
you
have
any
aliens
in
your
trunk
are
inherently
reasonable
and
nothing
else
is.
it's
a
balancing
test,
as
this
court
has
long
recognized,
and
an
important
part
of
that
balance
is
the
expectations
that
the
individual
brings
to
it,
and
the
expectation
of
the
individual
behind
the
wheel
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
times
that
i
will
come
into
contact
with
police
officers
and
i
will
need
to
stop,
i'm
highly
regulated,
i'm
highly
restricted,
and
i
am
engaged
in
a
privilege
of
driving
on
the
public
roadways.
walking
is
not
a
privilege.
driving
on
the
public
roadways
is
and
so
the
question...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
regulatory
need
for
it
is
that
there's...
you
have
a
very
common
police
practice
here,
and
one
that
we
expect
the
police
to
do
if
a...
a
fatality
has
been
committed
is
try
to
find
witnesses
who
were
there
at
the
time.
the
only
way
that
principle
can
work...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
is
extremely
common
for
these
types
of
informational
checkpoints.
there's
two
different
types
of
checkpoints.
there
is
the
one
that's
trying
to
catch
the
person
right
after
the
crime's
been
committed.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yeah.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
the
witness
checkpoints
are
quite
routinely
done,
either
24
hours,
or
very
routinely,
a
week
after,
because
people
are
creatures
of
habit
and
they
tend
to
drive
the
same
roads
at
the
same
time
of...
the
same
days,
and
so
it's
very
common...
a
number...
a
number
of
federal
checkpoints
have
been
done
exactly
like
this.
they've
been
done
a
week
after
a
child's
been
abducted.
in
the
elizabeth
smart
case,
it
was
a
week
later.
federal
checkpoints
that
i'm
familiar
with
were
done
exactly...
exactly
a
week
later,
and
you
try
to
go
at
the
exact
same
time,
because
that
is
eminently
sensible
for
police
officers.
if
you
want
to
look
for
the
witnesses,
you
want
to
find
people
who
are
most
likely
to
have
been
there
at
the
same
time.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i...
i
can't
give
you...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
absolutely.
the...
the
park
police
did
one...
the
federal
park
police
did
one
here
in
the
washington,
d.c.
area
a
couple
years
ago
that
found
four
eyewitnesses
to
a
hit-and-run
fatality.
but
also,
the
ability
to
measure
success
here...
we're
not
talking
about
immediately
removing
a
drunk
driver
from
the
road
or
actually
finding
the
alien...
solving...
you're
successful
if
you
defined
you
solved
the
crime,
and
solving
a
crime
is
not
a
linear
project.
it
involves
a
lot
of
information
coming
in
from
a
different...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice
ginsburg,
i...
two
responses.
first
of
all
there
are...
edmond
leaves
open
that
there
are
at
least
some
circumstances
when
you
can
do
this...
maybe
to
approach
is
exigency...
but
where
you
can
do
these
types
of
checkpoints
to
catch
someone.
the
language
there
was
a
fleeing
dangerous
criminal
who
was
going
by
particular
routes,
so
it's
not...
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
foreclosed
in
all
circumstances.
but
the
reason
it
makes
a
big
differences
for
purposes
of
fourth
amendment
principles,
there's
actually
three
reasons
why
looking
for
witnesses
is
better
and
should
be
more
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
than
what...
the
issue
in
edmond.
and
that
is,
there...
there's
a
difference
between,
just
a
practical
difference,
between
police
taking
action,
seizing
people
first
and
looking
for
a
crime
to
go
with
them,
which
is
what
was
going
on
in
edmond,
or
having
a
specific
crime
and
looking
to
solve
it
in
the
most
sensible
and
reasonable
manner
that
police
officers
do,
and
that
is
looking
for
witnesses.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
assuming
that
this
is
not...
it's
not
right
after
the
crime
that
i
have
the
description...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
this
court's...
i
think
both
of
them
are
different
from
edmond,
but
i
do
think
this
court's
doctrines
establish
why
the
witness
approach
is...
is
more...
is
less
intrusive
on
fourth
amendment
interests
for...
for
three
reasons.
one
is
that
there
is
a
self-incrimination
component,
self-protection
component
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
has
been
very
important
in
the
drug
testing
cases.
it
was
central
to
the
resolution
of
the
ferguson
decision
and
mentioned
in
camera...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i...
i'm...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
oh,
i'm
sorry...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we
would
like
to
have
them
both
sustained,
quite
frankly,
and
we
don't
think
they're...
they're
exactly
covered
by
edmond...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i...
i
think
the
witness
one
is
easier
for
three
reasons,
and
one
is
because
the
fourth
amendment
has
this
self-protection
principle,
which
is
not
implicated
when
you're...
you're
looking
for
witnesses.
the
checkpoint
does
not...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
yes,
the
witness
checkpoint,
the
looking
for
information
checkpoint.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'm
sorry
if
i'm
not...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
this
case
is
easier,
but...
but
there's...
there's
two
other
reasons
besides
the
self-protection
principle.
one
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
one
of
the
balancing
tests...
factors...
in
brown
v.
texas
is
the
level
of
anxiety.
when
a
police
officer
approaches
you
and
says...
even
if
it's
permissible...
i
want
to
know
if
you're
doing
something
wrong.
do
you
not
have
a
driver's
license?
are
you
drunk?
that's...
there's
a
little
more
anxiety
there
when
a
police...
than
when
a
police
officer
comes
and
says,
i
would
like
your
help,
someone
was
killed
here.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and...
and
the
third...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it's
all...
it's
all
very...
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
no.
part
of
the
brown
v.
texas
balancing
factors
is...
is
of...
one
of
the
things
that's
been
mentioned
is
the
level
of
anxiety,
and
the
reason
that
you
don't
have
roving
stops
but
you're
allowed
to
have
checkpoints
is
when
you
see
other
people
being
stopped
around
you,
even
if
they
want
to
know
if
you're
drunk...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
third...
thank
you...
the
third
reason
is...
is
a...
is
a...
there's
a
sort
of
a
practical
limitation
on
the
use
of
these
checkpoints
when
police
are
not
allowed
to
use
it
to
do
their
run-of-the-mill
business.
their
job
is
to
find
crimes
and
criminals.
edmond
was
a
checkpoint
to
find
crimes
and
criminals
that
we
didn't
know
about,
when
instead
all
that's
being
done
here
is
this
is
an
adjunct
to
a...
adapting
to
the
roadway
context
the
normal
investigative
processes
of
police
officers.
you...
you
don't
have
that
abuse,
and
the
same
way...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
is,
and
justice
kennedy,
you
also
asked
about
doctrinal
limitations
in
this
court's
cases,
and
in
atwater
v.
city
of
lago
vista
the
exact
same
argument
was
made
dealing
with
misdemeanor
arrests.
and
this
court's
decision
there
specifically
relied
upon
the
good
sense
and
political
accountability
of
police,
for
the
same
reason
that
we
know
police
don't
arrest
for
every
crime
and
infraction
that...
vehicle
code
infraction
that
they
find.
a
lot
of
police
chiefs
are
arrested
and
checkpoints
are
a
great
equalizer,
especially
these
kind
because
the
location
is
dictated
by
where
the
crime
occurred...
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
oh,
i
hope
i
said
elected.
[laughter]
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
