mr.
gary
feinerman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
lombard
informational
checkpoint
was
designed
to
find
witnesses
to
a
specific
known
crime.
the
principal
question
here
is
whether
the
checkpoint
is
per
se
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
whether
it's
governed
by
the
brown
balancing
test.
now,
the
touchstone
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
reasonableness,
which
generally
is
measured
by
balancing
the
government
interest
advanced
by
a
seizure
against
the
intrusion
on
the
individual
and
this
court
has
held
that
road...
roadway
checkpoints,
including
those
that
serve
a
law
enforcement
purpose,
are
governed
by
the
balancing
factors
set
forth
in
brown
v.
texas.
now,
in
edmond,
an
exception
was
carved
for
a
certain
category
of
law
enforcement
checkpoints,
those
that
are
designed
to
advance
the
general
interest
in
crime
control.
the
court
held
in
edmond
that
crime
control
checkpoints
are
not
subject
to
a
balancing
analysis,
but
rather
are
per
se
invalid.
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
this
case
held
that
informational
checkpoints,
including
the
lombard
checkpoint
here,
fall
within
that
general
crime
control
exception.
that
was
an
error.
per
se
invalidity
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
very
strong
medicine
and
ought
to
be
reserved
for
exceptional
circumstances,
and
those
circumstances...
mr.
gary
feinerman
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
gary
feinerman
i...
i
would
rely
on
the
amicus
briefs
submitted
by
the
illinois
association
of
chiefs
of
police
and
the
major
cities
chiefs
association,
and
they...
they
have
informed
the
court
that
roadblocks
are
not
used
frequently,
rather
they
are
used
judiciously
in
order
to
solve
certain...
mr.
gary
feinerman
it
was
a
week
later,
but
there
was
a
very
good
reason
why
the
checkpoint
was
set
up
at
that
particular
place
and
at
that
particular
time.
there
was
a
fatal
hit-and-run
accident
at
about
midnight
on
a
friday
night.
there
were
no
witnesses,
at
least
pedestrian
witnesses,
and
the
lombard
police
reasonably
concluded
that,
because
people's
driving
habits,
or
at
least
some
people's
driving
habits
might
be
regular,
that
some
of
the
drivers
that
were
there
on
the
night
in
question
would
also
be
driving
the
same
route
at
the
same
time
at
the
same
place
one
week
later,
and
we...
mr.
gary
feinerman
well,
it's
used
judiciously
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
are
the
resource
limitations.
these
kinds
of
roadblocks
are
very
resource-intensive.
there's
also
the
prudential
limits
that
the
police
departments
place
upon
themselves.
they
don't
want
to
appear
too
intrusive
to
the
public
and
this
is
a...
a
minor
inconvenience
and
the...
mr.
gary
feinerman
then
the
courts
step
in
and
apply
the
brown
reasonableness
factors.
mr.
gary
feinerman
that
would
be
closer...
that
would
be
closer
to
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
edmond,
although
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
present
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
what
we
believe
is
a
general
crime
control
roadblock,
which
is
that
it's
the
goal
of
the
police
to
incriminate
the
motorists
as
opposed
to
simply
seek
information.
mr.
gary
feinerman
that...
that
question,
of
course,
isn't
presented
here,
but
i...
i...
mr.
gary
feinerman
i
understand,
but
our...
i...
i
suppose
we
would
say
that
such
roadblocks
should
not
be
declared
per
se
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
rather
they
ought
to
be
subject
to
the
brown
balancing
test.
mr.
gary
feinerman
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances.
we
could...
mr.
gary
feinerman
i
think
there...
there
would
be...
mr.
gary
feinerman
no.
mr.
gary
feinerman
i
can't...
mr.
gary
feinerman
it's,
in
my
most
instances
it
would
be
bad,
but...
mr.
gary
feinerman
i...
i
don't
know
if
we
could
foreclose
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
some
circumstances
were
such
a
roadblock
would
be
reasonable.
for
example,
let's
assume
that
in...
in
some
area
of
some
city
that
there's
just
rapid
lawlessness
because
of
a
blackout
or
whatever
and
there
are
hundreds
of
crimes
committed
and
the
police
might
want
to
canvass
the
neighborhood
but
nobody
wants
to
be
seen
talking
to
a
police
officer.
so
in
that
instance
perhaps
a
roadblock
would
be
set
up
where
the
police
would
hand
each
motorist
a
piece
of
paper
saying,
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
me
now
but
here's
a
number,
and
if
you
know
of
anything
that
had
happened
that
was
unlawful,
please
feel
free
to
give
us
a
call,
we'll
maintain
our
confidentiality.
mr.
gary
feinerman
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
would
be
a...
a
crime
control
roadblock.
mr.
gary
feinerman
that...
that
perhaps
would
be
valid
and
now
it
would
be
a
better
practice,
of
course,
if
the
police
were
to
simply
approach
cars
that
were
stopped
at
a
stoplight
or
a
stop
sign
or
a
tollbooth.
mr.
gary
feinerman
yeah,
we...
that...
that
argument
perhaps
could
been
made
below
but
it
wasn't,
and
as
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
assumption
is
that
if...
if
the
roadblock
were
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment,
then
the
subsequent
arrest
would
be
as
well.
even
though
the...
the...
mr.
lidster
almost
running
into
the
police
officer
did
provide
cause,
that
question's
not
presented
here.
mr.
gary
feinerman
no,
justice
souter,
because
pedestrians
have
greater
fourth
amendment
rights
than
motorists.
mr.
gary
feinerman
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
with
respect.
it
would
be
permissible
with
motorists.
it
wouldn't
be
permissible
with
pedestrians
because
motorists
do
not
have
the
same
expectation
of
freedom
of
movement
that
pedestrians
do.
mr.
gary
feinerman
again,
i...
i
just
have
to
rely
on
my
prior
answer.
it's
because
this
court
has
held
that
in
certain...
in
certain
situations,
suspicionless
roadway
stops
are
permissible,
or
at
least
subject...
potentially
permissible
and
subject
to
the
brown
balancing
test.
mr.
gary
feinerman
that's
correct.
the
police
can
walk
up
to
any
pedestrian
and
ask
questions
and
that's
not
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
gary
feinerman
no.
mr.
gary
feinerman
no.
that's
brown
v.
texas.
the
police
cannot
do
that,
but...
mr.
gary
feinerman
if...
if
he's...
if
he
rolled
on
through
and...
or...
or
if
he
stopped
and
said,
i
don't
like...
i
don't
want
to...
mr.
gary
feinerman
the...
the
record
doesn't
reflect
whether
any
such
instances
happened
and
that
would
be
a
close...
mr.
gary
feinerman
perhaps
he
would
be
arrested
for
not
following...
[laughter]
perhaps
he
would
be
arrested
for
not
following
the
police
officer's...
mr.
gary
feinerman
instruction,
but
really
the...
mr.
gary
feinerman
no,
no.
and
that's
brown
v.
texas.
pedestrians
cannot
be
seized
for
this
purpose
and
that
this...
mr.
gary
feinerman
no.
our
position
is
not
that
there
are
exigent
circumstances.
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
a
general
crime
control
roadblock.
a
crime...
mr.
gary
feinerman
it's
our
position
that
it's
only
the
time
that...
of
the
police-motorist
encounter.
mr.
gary
feinerman
in...
in
our...
we...
we...
if...
were
that
question
presented,
we
would
say
that
that's
irrelevant
because
that's
simply
endemic.
that's
just
a
byproduct
of
driving.
mr.
gary
feinerman
that's
true,
and...
but
what's...
the
reason
why...
the
police
don't
want
there
to
be
a
line.
the
police
just
want
to
talk
to
each
motorist
as
they're
driving
by.
mr.
gary
feinerman
yeah,
i
should
mention...
i
should
mention
that
mr.
lidster
at
his
trial,
at
page
47
of
the
transcript,
testified
that
there
were
only
three
cars
in
front
of
him.
so
he
was
stopped
really
for...
at
most
only
a
minute,
which
is
permissible.
but
were
there
a
case
as
in
your
hypothetical
where
a
motorist
were
stopped
for
a
half
an
hour,
we
would
still
say
that
that
waiting
time
doesn't
count
because
that's
really
more
a
function
of
the
number
of
vehicles
on
the
street
and
it's
not
really...
it
was
not
intended
by
the
officer
that
there
be
this
backup.
mr.
gary
feinerman
it...
mr.
gary
feinerman
that
would
be
possible,
but
this
court
has
said
very
clearly
that
a
less
restrictive
means
test
is
not
to
be
applied
under
the
second
brown
factor.
mr.
gary
feinerman
that's
correct.
that
is
a
factor
and...
but
these
kinds
of
signs
or
billboards,
it
isn't
like
it
just
says,
drink
budweiser
or
fly
united
airlines,
there's
a
lot
of
information
on
there,
and
if
these
cars
are...
mr.
gary
feinerman
that...
that's
what
the
brown
balancing
test
is
there
for.
it's
there
to
determine
what
kinds
of
stops
are
reasonable
and
which
one
aren't.
now,
if
there
are
some
circumstances
where
we
can
imagine
that
we'd
want
to
have
this
kind
of
informational
checkpoint,
then
a...
and
that's
really
the
principal
question
here.
there
ought
not
to
be
a
per
se
rule,
because
there
are
some
situations,
and
we
submit
that
this
is
one
of
them,
where
it
makes
perfect
sense
for
the
police
to
set
up
a
roadblock
because
the
physical
evidence
recovered
from
the
scene
was
not
sufficient
to
identify
the
perpetrator,
and
the
only
witnesses
to
the
crime
were
fellow
motorists,
and
there
was
really
only
one
way
our...
there
wasn't
only
one
way,
but
this
was
a
very
good
way
of
getting
at
them.
and
if
there
are
circumstances
where
we
can
imagine
that
we'd
want
to
enable
the
police
to
solve
crimes
in
this
manner,
then
a
per
se
rule
is
invalid.
it
ought
to
go
through
brown
balancing.
mr.
gary
feinerman
i
have
no
statistics
from
across
the
nation
and
i'd
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
answer
your
question.
the
lombard
police
asked
the
local
news
to
actually
cover
the
roadblock,
which
they
did,
and
somebody
who
was
watching
the
local
news
realized
that
a
gentleman
in
her
apartment
complex
had
recently
had
damage
to
the
right
headlight
of
his
f-150
and
called...
mr.
gary
feinerman
well,
we
have
to...
mr.
gary
feinerman
they
may
not
have
done
that.
if...
if
there
are
no
further...
mr.
gary
feinerman
justice
scalia
makes
a
good
point,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
gary
feinerman
this
court
in
edmond
found
that
narcotics
check...
narcotics
checkpoints
are
so
obnoxious
to
core
fourth
amendment
values
that
a
per
se
rule
of
invalidity
was
justified
and
the
principal
question
here
is
whether
informational
checkpoints
present
the
same
fourth
amendment
dangers
that
general
crime
control
checkpoints
present,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
and
in
order
to
answer
that,
we...
we
have
to
figure
out
what
the
hallmarks
are
of
a
crime
control
checkpoint,
and
we
suggest
that
there
are
at
least
two.
the
first
is
that
it's
the
purpose
of
the
checkpoint
to
incriminate
the
motorist
as
opposed
to
the
situation
in
lombard,
which
was
simply
the
police
asking
for
help,
and
that
distinction
makes
a
difference
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
several
reasons.
the
first
has
to
do
with
privacy.
at
a
general
crime
control
checkpoint,
the
police
are
trying
to
learn
something
about
you,
whether
you've
committed
a
wrongdoing,
whereas
at
an
informational
checkpoint
there's
just
asking
for
help,
somebody
died
here
last
week,
could
you
help
us
find
the
perpetrator.
there's
also
a
difference
in
terms
of
jeopardy.
at
a
general
crime
control
checkpoint
you
may
be
interrogated,
detained,
arrested,
prosecuted,
and
possibly
jailed,
whereas
at
an
informational
checkpoint,
again,
you're
just
being
asked
for
help,
and
that's
a
critical
distinction
that
this
court
drew
in
ferguson
between
the
drug
test
that
was
invalidated
in
ferguson
and
the
drug
testing
programs
that
were
upheld
in
skinner,
acton,
and
von
raab.
there's
also
an
indignity
element
to
a
general
crime
control
checkpoint.
you're
being...
it's...
it's
a
bit
of
an
indignity
to
be
suspected
as
being
a
potential
law-breaker,
whereas
in...
in
an
informational
checkpoint
there's
really
no
impingement
on
dignity,
you're
just,
again,
being
treated
as
an
ally
of
the
police
and
being
asked
for
help,
and
in
fact,
it's
an
act
of
responsible
citizenship
to
provide
help
in
that
kind
of
situation.
the
second
distinction
is
that
a
general
crime
control
checkpoint...
the
police
are
simply
trolling
for
hitherto
undiscovered
crimes,
whereas
in
an
informational
checkpoint,
they're
investigating
a
known,
specific
crime,
and
that's
who
makes
a
difference.
there's
a
difference
between...
as
ms.
millett
pointed
out...
there's
a
difference
between
knowing
a
crime
and
finding
the
criminal
and
then
simply
rounding
up
a
bunch
of
potential
criminals
and
trying
to
peg
a
crime
on
them.
and
that's
important
not
only
for
the
fact
that
we're
uncomfortable
with
general...
general
surveillance,
but
also
it's
a
traditional
police
function.
when
a
crime
happens,
police
ought
to
return
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
find
witnesses.
thank
you.
