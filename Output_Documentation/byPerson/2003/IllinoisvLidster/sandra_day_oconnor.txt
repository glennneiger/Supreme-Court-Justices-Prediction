well,
i
suppose
we'd
have
to
decide
here
not
only
whether
it
was
per
se
invalid,
but
whether
it
was
reasonable
under
any
other
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
let
me
ask
you,
is
it
often
that
roadblocks
are
set
up
just
to
get
information
like
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
was
a
little
odd.
it
was
a
week
later?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
in
the
edmonds
case,
the
court
opinion
said
that
under
exigent
circumstances
there
could
be
some
kind
of
a...
an
appropriately
tailored
roadblock.
do
you
take
the
position
that
trying
to
find
a
witness
was
some
kind
of
an
exigent
circumstance
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
evidence.
i
thought
they
were
given
a
flyer
saying
if
you...
read
this
and
see
if
you
observed
anything
that
could
help
us
find
the
hit-and-run
driver.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
this...
is
it
the
case
that
in
this
very
situation
we're
talking
about
it
led
to
information
about
the
person
responsible?
