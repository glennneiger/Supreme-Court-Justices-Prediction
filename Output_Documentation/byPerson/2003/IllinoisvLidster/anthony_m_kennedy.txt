justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the...
you...
you
said
that
they
had
to
be
used
judiciously
and
that's
a
good
word,
but
our...
do
our
precedents
in
this
area
generally
say,
well,
we
defer
to
the
good
judgement
of
the
police,
they
won't
use
them
too
often.
the
illinois
supreme
court
said,
oh,
if
we
allow
this,
we're
going
to
have
roadblocks
every
other...
every
day,
every
other
street
and
in
part
that's
hyperbole,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
does
caution
us
that
there
should
be
some
limiting
principle
and
i
just
don't
know
if
our
precedents
would
support
us
in
adopting
your
word,
oh,
if
it's
used
judiciously.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
had
that
kind
of
a
roadblock
and
one
of
the
drivers
just
about
ran
into
the
policeman,
do
you
think
that
the
court...
the
courts
would
entertain
the
argument
that,
well,
the
initial
stop
was
invalid,
therefore
running
into
the
policeman...
it
cannot
be
grounds
for
the
arrest?
i...
it's
just
a
clumsy
way
of
asking,
i
guess,
whether...
whether
or
not
there
is
any
kind
of
a
causation
break
here,
causation
link
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
following
justice
ginsburg's
question,
which
is
the
easier
of
the
two
cases?
the
one
we
have
here
or
a
hypothetical
case
in
which
they
have
a
description
of
the
hit-and-run
driver
and
they
stop
everybody
to
look
in
the
car
to
see
if
the
driver
meets
the
description?
which
is
the
easier
of
the
two
cases
to
sustain?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
week
later,
everything
else
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what's
the
third
reason?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
a
pending
question
about
the...
the
third
reason.
i...
what's
the
third
reason?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this
is
a
built-in
limitation
on
the
frequency
of
its
use?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
indications
nationwide
that
the
public
makes
objection
to
roadblocks,
other
than
the
person
that's
caught
for
drunk
driving?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
is
there
evidence
of
that?
