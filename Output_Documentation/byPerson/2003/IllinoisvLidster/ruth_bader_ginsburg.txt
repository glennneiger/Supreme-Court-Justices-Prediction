does
one
have
a...
in...
is
it...
a
greater
sense
of
privacy
walking
down
a
main
thoroughfare
than
being
in
a
car?
i
understand
the
distinction
between
a
home
or
an
office,
but
you're
out
there
on
the
street
and
the
police
could
make...
could...
the
police
could
go
to
any
particular
pedestrian
and
say,
could
you
tell
me
if
you
know
anything
about
x
crime
that
was
committed
in
this
neighborhood
and
the
police
could
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
might
distract
drivers
if...
if
a
big
sign
on
the
road...
on
the
highway
when
you're
supposed
to
be
looking
at
the
road.
that
might
be
a
reason,
but
there's
a...
there's
an
aspect
of
this,
you've
repeated
the
police
many
times,
and
one
of
the
worrisome
things
of
this
set-up
is
all
you
need
is
a
crime,
and
in
major
metropolitan
areas
there
are
crimes,
multiple
crimes
every
day.
who
makes
the
decision?
the
local
police
chief.
and
then
after
some,
you
can
get
into
court.
it's...
it's
not
like
the
law
dictates
this
or
even
the
state's
attorney
general,
but
it's
in
every
town,
the
local
police
chief
that
may
have
just
a
range
of
views
about
using
roadblocks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
do
this
to
try
to
get
the
perpetrator.
that
would
clearly
be
edmond,
and
there
seems
to
be
something
odd
about
saying,
police,
you
can't
have
a
roadblock
in
a
neighborhood
where
you
think
that
it's
likely
the
suspect
is
living,
but
you
can
if
you
say
what
you're
looking
for,
it's
not
the
suspect,
but
witnesses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
it
would
be
okay
to
have
a
roadblock
to
collect
for
the
policemen's
benevolent
fund?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ramsell,
did
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
if
the
crime
had
been
a
child
abduction,
that
this
kind
of
roadblock
to
try
to
get
evidence
would
be
permissible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
if...
if
it's
the
danger
involved
and
wanting
to
save
a
life
that
we
hope
is
still
in
being,
why
isn't
the
same
thing
if
you're
trying
to
get
evidence
about
a
hit-and-run
person
who
kills
people
on
the
highway?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
about
a
rape
murder
that...
you
know
that
that's
not
just
a
hypothetical
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
rape
murder
recently
occurred
and
the
police
set
up
a
roadblock
to
get
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
would
this...
would
this
case
have
been
different
if
it
had
been
the
next
day
rather
than
a
week
later?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you
need
a
little...
if
you
have
a
little
evidence,
then
you
can
seek
more.
but
if
you
had
none,
you
can't
try
to
get
a
lead
by
this
technique?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
wasn't
very
much
on
the
flyer,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we...
we
have
it
someplace,
don't
we?
justice
ginsburg
is
it
true
that...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ramsell,
do
you
know...
going
back
to
justice
souter's
question...
whether
in
the
aftermath
of
sitz
there
have
been
an
increase
in
sobriety
checkpoints
in
this
country?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do...
do
they
exist
in
michigan
anymore,
these
sobriety
checkpoints?
