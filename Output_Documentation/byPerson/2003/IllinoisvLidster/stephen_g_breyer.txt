yes,
yes,
but
which
is
more
consistent...
which
is
easier
to
say
is
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
just...
i'm
mixed
up
with
easier
because
i
don't...
which
is...
the
two
cases
that
he
gave,
in
which
do
you
think
it's
easier
for
you
to
win
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
this
case
is
easier?
justice
breyer
this
case
is
easier?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
sounds
a
little
colorful,
but...
but
in
my
own
mind
i'm
thinking
that
this
is
asking
people
to
help
with
crime
investigation
and
to
spend
10
seconds
listening
to
the
request.
now,
it's...
i
was
delayed
2
hours...
not
2
hours,
but
like
2
minutes
anyway,
or
3
minutes,
this
morning
coming
in,
for
the
last
couple
of
days
because
they
had
some
tree
pruning
equipment,
all
right?
so
maybe
they
could
put
that
on
the
sidewalk
and
not
delay
me,
but
i
don't
mind.
i
did
actually
mind,
but
i
mean...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
you
see,
it's
not...
what
their
argument
is,
and
that's,
at
least
for
me,
what
i'd
like
you
to
address,
is
this
is
not
much
of
a...
of
a
demand
on
people
to
stop
for
10
seconds
when
they're
trying
to
find
out
somebody
who
killed
someone
and...
and
we
just
want
you
to
listen
for
10
seconds.
now,
why...
why
is
that
such
an
unreasonable
thing
for
the
police
to
ask
the
public
to
do?
nobody
has
to
take
the
flyer,
they
don't
even
have
to
help.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
don't
care
about
the...
i'm
asking
you...
i
understand...
i'm
asking
you
why
it's
unreasonable.
that's
the
word
in
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
tried
to
make
it
as...
as
reasonable-sounding
as
i
could.
maybe
somebody
else
could
do
better,
but
i
want
your
response
to
my
effort
to
make
this
sound
very
reasonable.
that's
what
i'm
interested
in,
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
really
want
to
hear
cases
so
much.
i
want
to
hear
in
common
sense
why
this
isn't
a
reasonable
thing
to
do.
i'm
not
saying
you
even
have
to
convince
me
to
win
your
case,
i'm
just
saying
that
for...
i'd
like
to
know
why,
in
ordinary,
common-sense
english,
this
isn't
the
most
reasonable
thing
in
the
world?
now,
i'm...
i'm
now
overstating
it
so
you'll
be
sure
to
give
me
an
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
pretty
serious,
isn't
it,
called
hit-and-run?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
all
that's
at
stake
is
that
it
was
a
hit-and-run
and
the
guy's
dead,
all
right.
so...
so
now
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
reasonableness
of
this?
i'm
not...
not
asking
you
facetiously
because
i
think
maybe
you
think
you
want
to
tie
it
in
and
i
just
want
you
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
mean
that
it
might
be
reasonable
to
do
it
for
some
serious
crimes
but
not
for
less
serious?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
you
seem...
seem
to
be
arguing
the
same
thing
that,
other
things
being
equal,
if
you
lose
on
your
other
points
you
could
only
do
it
in
a
serious
but
not
non-serious.
is
that
what
you're...
is
that
the
point
you're
making?
and
if
so,
i
want
to
know
what
the
line
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
asks
whether
the
fourth
amendment
permits
police
to
set
up
a
highway
checkpoint
and
stop
motorists
in
order
to
ask
them
for
information
about
a
hit-and-run
accident.
the
accident
took
place
in
august
1997
when
an
unidentified
motorist
hit
and
killed
a
70-year-old
bicyclist.
about
a
week
later,
the
police
set
up
a
checkpoint
on
the
highway.
each
car
would
draw
to
a
stop
at
the
checkpoint
remaining
there
for
10
to
15
seconds
while
a
police
officer
ask
the
occupants
whether
they
had
seen
anything
happened
there
at
the
previous
weekend
and
each
policeman
handed
each
deriver
a
flyer
which
described
the
accident
and
requested
information.
now,
the
respondent,
in
this
case
robert
lidster,
is
driving
a
mini
van
and
as
it
approached
the
checkpoint
it
swerved
nearly
hitting
one
of
the
officers.
the
officer
smelled
alcohol
on
his
breath
and
they
gave
him
a
sobriety
test,
they
arrested
him,
and
he
was
convicted
of
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and
eventually
his
conviction
got
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
ground
of
the
checkpoint
stop,
this
roadblock,
violated
the
fourth
amendment’s
prohibition
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
now,
we
are
here
considering
the
illinois
supreme
court’s
decision
a
constitutional
question
and
we
disagree
with
that
court’s
constitutional
conclusion.
the
illinois
court
fought
that
the
case
called
indianapolis
versus
edmond,
a
case
that
this
court
governed
the
outcome.
in
edmond,
this
court
held
that
police
checkpoint
stops
of
automobiles
ordinarily
do
violate
the
fourth
amendment
unless
they
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
stopped
individual
committed
a
crime.
everybody
agrees
there
was
no
individualized
suspicion
here,
but
edmond
concerned
the
kind
of
stop
to
which
reasonable
suspicion
might
be
relevant
or
it
could
matter,
namely
a
stop
designed
to
see
whether
a
car’s
occupant
had
committed
a
crime
or
were
committing
a
crime,
and
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
stop.
it
is
a
very
different
stop
with
a
very
different
kind
of
purpose.
the
stop
is
one
of
enlisting
the
help
of
the
vehicle’s
occupant
as
members
of
the
public
in
providing
information
about
a
crime
committed
not
by
them
but
of
other
people.
so
edmond,
we
think,
is
beside
the
point.
nor
do
we
believe,
putting
edmond
to
beside,
we
do
not
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
applications
to
this
information
gathering
kind
of
stop
a
legal
rule
that
would
make
them
all
unconstitutional.
that
kind
of
a
rule
would
often
prevent
policemen
from
asking
motorists
for
assistance.
it
would
deprive
them
if
important
law
enforcement
help
with
voluntary
cooperation
by
members
of
the
public
can
provide.
now,
clearly
the
law
allows
policemen
to
ask
members
of
the
public
to
help,
at
least
when
they
are
pedestrian.
and
we
think
an
opposite
rule
that
would
stop
them
from
asking
motorists
for
help
cannot
be
justified.
so,
our
conclusion
on
the
law
is
that
we
apply
a
rule
of
reason
to
such
stops.
to
determine
whether
a
particular
stop
was
reasonable,
we
have
to
look
to
the
gravity
of
the
public
concern,
the
degree
to
which
the
seizure
advances
the
public
interest
and
the
severity
of
the
interference
with
individual
liberty.
we
then
apply
those
factors
in
this
case.
we
think
the
public
concern
was
grave.
the
police
were
investigating
a
crime
that
had
resulted
in
a
human
death.
the
police
tailored
the
stop
to
the
circumstance
advancing
their
grave
concern
to
a
significant
degree.
the
stops
interfered
only
minimally
with
liberty,
contact
with
the
police
lasted
just
a
few
seconds
and
it
consisted
of
a
simple
request
and
a
flyer.
for
these
reasons
and
for
others
set
out
in
the
opinion,
we
think
the
information-seeking
stop
is
a
reasonable
one,
thus,
it
was
constitutional.
we
reverse
the
illinois
supreme
court.
justice
stevens
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
