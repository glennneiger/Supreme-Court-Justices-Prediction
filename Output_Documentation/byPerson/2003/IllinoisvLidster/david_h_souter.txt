justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
feinerman,
may
i
go
back
to
your
own
hypothetical
of
a
moment
ago
in
which
this
crime
has
been
committed,
people
don't
want
to
be
seen
talking
to
the
police,
so
the
police
might
set
up
a
roadblock
under
those
circumstances.
what
about
the
same
situation
in
which
the
police
say...
and
i
suppose
it
would
be
reasonable
in
your
hypo
that
they
need
to
talk
to
a
lot
more
people
than
simply
the
ones
who
were
driving
in
cars...
on
your
reasoning,
could
the
police,
in
effect,
cordon
off
sidewalks
so
that
any
pedestrian
coming
down
the
sidewalk
would
have
to
pass
through
sort
of
a
chute
at
the
end
and
could
not
get
through
with
stopping
to
talk
to
the
police
officer
and
answer
questions
in
order
to
get
through?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they...
they...
they
do
in
the
sense
that
we...
we
recognize
certain
rights
to
stop
the
motorist
because
of
the
regulated
nature
and
the
highly
dangerous
nature
of
the...
of
the
driving
enterprise.
but
here
we're
talking
about
stops
which
bear
absolutely
no
relation
to
the
regulation
of
motor
vehicles.
the
only
reason
for
the
stop
in
the
case
that
you're
defending,
and
the
only
reason
for
the
stop
in
my
hypo
is
that
there
may
be
an
opportunity
to
gather
evidence
from
a
citizen
who
won't
come
forward
but
would
answer
a
question.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
difference
between
cars
and
pedestrians
has
nothing
to
do
with
the...
the...
the
answer
to
my
question.
am
i
wrong
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
no,
but
the
justification
for
interfering
with
their
freedom
of
movement
is
not
the
justification
that's
involved
in
this
stop.
you're
not
looking
for
impaired
motorists.
you're
not
checking
licenses
and
registration.
you're
simply
stopping
motorists
because
they
might
have
seen
a
crime,
and
in
the
extension
of
your
hypo
i'm
talking
the
pedestrian
who
might
have
seen
a
crime
or
have
some
evidence
of
it.
they're
in
exactly
the
same
situation.
if
you
can
stop
the
cars,
why
can't
you
stop
the
pedestrians?
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
mentioned
that
this
is
a
good
way
to
get
at
the
people
you
want
to
get
to.
is
there
any
indication
that
there...
anything
of
value
was
obtained
in
the
investigation
of
this
crime
in
this
particular
roadblock,
or
do
you
have
any
information
across
the...
from...
from
broader
statistics
across
the
nation
about
the
effectiveness
of
doing
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
if
the
police
had...
if
the
police
had
asked
the
local
news
to...
to
broadcast
a
2-minute
clip
of
a
police
officer
saying,
we're
having
trouble
finding
the
perpetrator
of
this
crime,
please
come
forward,
wouldn't
that
have
gotten
the
same
result?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
does
the
distinction...
you've
mentioned
it
and...
and
mr.
feinerman
mentioned
it...
why
does
the
distinction
between
cars
and
pedestrians
apply
in
a
case
in
which
the...
the
justification
for
making
that
distinction,
regulation,
a
risk
of
impaired
driving,
does
not
apply?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
my
expectation
of
freedom
of
movement
in
the
car
is
that,
yeah,
the
police
can
stop
to...
for
a
sobriety
checkpoint
and
i'll
assume
they
can...
they
can
stop
to...
to
check
my...
my
license
and
the
registration
of
the
car,
but
i
also
assume
that
they
can't,
you
know,
barring
today,
the
result
of
today's
case,
i...
i'm
assuming
that
they...
they
can't
stop
me
for...
for
other
reasons,
barring
some
really
exigent
circumstance.
and
if
that
expectation
is
reasonable,
and
i
think
it
has
been
at
least
up
until
today,
then
i
think
my
expectation
is...
is
the
same
as
the
pedestrian's
expectation,
barring
the...
the
regulatory
authority
of...
of
exercising
the
regulatory
authority,
which
is
not
in...
in
issue
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're...
you're
saying
that
because
they
might
have
observed
or...
or
observed
evidence
in
the
exercise
of
their
privilege
that
that
would
be
a
regulatory
basis
for
stopping
them
in
the
cars,
whereas
there
wouldn't
be
any
such
basis
for
the
pedestrian?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
we
understand
that
when...
when
there's
something
pretty
contemporaneous
between
the
stopping
and
the...
and
the
accident.
that's
what
i
had
in
mind
with
exigency.
but
do
we...
is...
is
it
such
a
common
practice
that
a
week
later
or
two
weeks
later...
justice
david
h.
souter
i
got
mixed
up...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if...
if
they
hired
someone
like
justice
scalia
to
go
on
the
screen
and
describe
it...
justice
souter
big
audience.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
okay.
mr.
ramsell,
there's
something
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on.
the...
the
illinois
supreme
court
was...
was
concerned
about
the...
the
effect
of...
of
this
practice,
in
effect,
in
opening
the
door
to
stops
all
the
time.
they
said,
you
know,
there
are
loads
of
crimes
and
if
it's
justified
here
it
will
be
justified
in
other
cases
and
so
on,
and
there
have
been
some
questions
from
the
bench
to
that
effect.
one
answer
to
that
might
be
that
under
the
law
as
it
stands
now
the
police
can
conduct
sobriety
checkpoints
and
we
will
assume
that
they
can
make
license
and
registration
checks
and
things
like
that.
so
the...
the
police
already
have
an
opportunity,
to
put
it
bluntly,
to
abuse
their
right
to
stop
if
they
want
to
do
it.
is
there
any
indication
that
there
is
this
kind
of
abuse
going
on,
and
hence,
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
abuse
would
be
greater
if
this
practice
passed
muster
than
it
is
under
the
existing
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what...
what
do
we
know?
empirically,
what
we
do
know?
what
is...
has
there...
has
there
been
an
indication
of
abuse?
is
there
a
reason
to
believe
that
this
invitation,
this
tool,
would
be
abused
more
than
the
tools
that
they
now
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why...
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
makes
for
great
publicity
to...
to
have
sobriety
checkpoints.
that's
one
reason
why
they
have
them.
