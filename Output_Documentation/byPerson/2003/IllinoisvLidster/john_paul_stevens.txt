justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he'd
be
arrested,
let's...
he'd
be
arrested
pretty...
justice
stevens
well,
now...
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
make
your
balance
under
brown,
do
you...
does
the
time
that
it
takes
to
answer
the
officer's
inquiry
the
relevant
factor
or
the
time
you
have
to
wait
in
line
if
there's
a
big...
it's
a
crowded
street,
you
know,
they...
you
cause
a
traffic
jam,
you
have
to
wait
20
minutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
even
if
in
fact
the
delay
caused
the...
a
bunch
of
people
a
half
hour's
delay,
that
would
be
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
byproduct
of
the
seizure
of
one
person
that
you
got
to
wait...
wait
in
turn
to
be
seized
yourself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if...
if
you're
on
a
busy
street,
as
they
were
in...
in...
i
forget
which
suburb
of
chicago
this
was...
lombard.
in
lombard,
you're
gonna...
you're
gonna
tie
up
traffic
for
a
while.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i...
i
wonder
if
you'd
answer
justice
kennedy's
question.
which
is
the
easier
case?
justice
stevens
you
don't
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
a
factor
but...
justice
john
paul
stevens
that...
that
cuts
against
you
in
this
case,
though,
doesn't
it?
this
was
at
midnight.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
if
we
endorsed...
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view
that
they
can
stop
for
the
chief
just
as
a
purpose,
there's
going
to
be
massive
change
in
the
way
these
organizations
raise
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
please?
the
blue
brief
describes
it
as
a...
a
roadblock...
roadblock
set
up
in
the
evening,
and
as
i
understand
it
the
crime
was
at
12:15
a.m.,
which
i
interpret
to
be
midnight.
it
was
a
midnight
crime
and
i
thought
the
roadblock
was
at
midnight,
and
i
wonder,
how
long
did
it
last?
was
it
started
in
the
evening
and
lasted
several
hours
or
was
it
just...
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it...
it
was
though
in
the
dark
at...
at
night,
not
during
the
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
also
don't
understand
if
they
handed
something
to
read,
how
could
you
read
in
the...
at
the...
in
the
dark?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
explain
that
they
did
hand
something
legible
to
the
person
or
use
a
flashlight
or
what...
what
was
the...
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
they...
were
there
something
they
were
asked
to
read
before
they
left
or
just
left
with
them
to
drive
away
with?
i
just
don't
understand
what
happened,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
might
i
ask
another
question
about
the...
the
facts
of
the
case?
reading
the
flyer,
it's
something
you
could
have
handed
to
a
pedestrian
too
who
might
have
been
at
the
scene.
does
the
record
show
whether
they
did
hand
this
flyer
to
pedestrians
who
might
have
been
walking
by
at
the
same
time
the
week
after
the
accident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
know...
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
there
are
no
sidewalks
there?
