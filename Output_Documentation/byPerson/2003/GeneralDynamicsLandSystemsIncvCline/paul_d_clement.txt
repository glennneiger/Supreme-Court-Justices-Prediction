mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
absent
an
affirmative
defense,
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age
against
members
of
the
protected
class
and
is
not
limited
to
claims
brought
by
the
older
members
of
the
class.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there's
no
affirmative
defense
in
the
statute,
justice
stevens,
and
let
me
address
those
hypotheticals,
because
i
think
these
seemingly
benevolent
instances
of
using
age
may
be
beguiling,
but
i
think
in
reality
even
those
benevolent
uses
of
age
implicate
the
interests
and
concerns
of
the
age
act.
take,
for
example,
an
employer
who's
willing
to
exempt
employees
over
50
from
a
physical
fitness
test.
well,
the
first
question
i
would
ask
is,
if
you're
willing
to
exempt
workers
over
50
from
the
physical
fitness
test,
is
the
physical
fitness
test
really
a
legitimate
occupational
qualification?
and
should
that
be
used
to
exclude
workers
between
40
and
50
from
the
workplace?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
it
seems
to
me
that
stereotypes
that
older
workers
are
going
to
be
more
strained
and
can't
work
as
hard
and
need
time
off
are
precisely
the
stereotypes
the
act
is
designed
to
prohibit.
now,
it's
different
if
a
worker...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
1625.2(b)
is
limited
to
benefits,
and
charles
shaner,
who's
the
general
counsel
of
the
eeoc
at
the
time
that
the
older
worker
benefit
protection
act
was
passed,
explained
that
the
statutory
affirmative
defense
that
would
be
implicated
here
on
remand,
623(f)(2)(b)(i),
is
a
simplification
of
that
regulatory
defense.
and
i
think
what
the
act
as
a
general
matter
does
is
it
recognizes
that
benefits
are
more
difficult
because
it's
tied
up
with
issues
of
retirement
age
and
the
like,
and
so
a
more
flexible
approach
is
necessary
with
respect
to
benefits.
but
with
respect
to
core
employment,
hiring,
firing,
promotion,
and
compensation,
the
act
reflects
a
judgement,
as
stated
in
the
purpose,
that
they
want
to
promote
the
employment
of
older
people
on
the
basis...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
think
that's
right.
unless
this
court
were,
i
mean,
if
this
court
has
a...
has
a
very
flexible
view
of
age
in
the
prohibition,
i
suppose
it
could
allow
the
agency
to
adopt
a
flexible
affirmative
defense
along
the
lines
of
weber.
let
me
also...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
why
not?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
let
me
also
say
that
the
statute
specifically
gives
the
eeoc,
in
29
u.s.c.
628,
the
regulatory
authority
to
make
exemptions,
and
i
think
if
there
are
specific
concerns
with
particular
practices
that
seem
benevolent
and
are
benevolent,
then
the
eeoc
can
make
a
regulatory
exemption.
but
with
respect
to
these
seemingly
benevolent...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
29
u.s.c.
628.
it's
in
the
statutory
appendix,
i
believe
at
page
4a,
and
that...
and
that
is...
that
is
a
sweeping
authority.
it
gives
the
eeoc
both
the
authority
to
make
interpretive
regulations
and
substantive
exemptions
from
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think,
as
i
said,
if...
i
think
that...
that
the
act
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
idea
that
these
stereotypes
should
play
no
role.
the
purpose
clause
of
the
statute
says
it
wants
to
promote
the
employment
of
older
workers,
but
how
does
it
say
it
wants
to
promote
the
employment
of
older
workers?
by
having
them
judged
on
their
ability
rather
than
age.
and
i
think
it
reflects
a
judgement
that
an
employer
that
has
age
in
mind
and
not
ability
when
trying
to
favor
an
older
worker
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
reverse
the
process
when
they're
working
to
the
detriment
of
a
worker.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
think
that's
right,
justice
breyer,
but
what's...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
two
responses,
justice
breyer.
first...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
first,
i
think
that
the
natural
human
instinct
to
favor
an
older
worker
would
be
to
cut
a
break
to
a
worker
who's
been
with
the
company
many
years,
and
if
that's
what
an
employer
wants
to
do,
it's
perfectly
free
under
the
age
act
to
say,
if
you've
been
with
us
30
years
or
20
years,
we're
going
to
cut
you
a
break.
to
the
extent
that's
not
the
motivation,
but
it's
purely
age-based,
then
there
is
an
indication
in
the
statutory
history,
and
that
indication
is
the
colloquy
between
senators...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
the
colloquy
is
not
at
all
ambiguous.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia,
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia,
i
can
tell
you
this.
the
same
number
of
people
heard
that
colloquy
as
heard
the
colloquy
that
this
court
relied
on
between
the
same
two
senators
in
interpreting
the
age
act
in
betts
and
in
united
airlines
against
mcmann.
on
two
occasions
this
court
has
recognized
that
those
two
senators
have
important
views
on
the
age
act
because
they
were
the
principal
sponsors
and
the
floor
managers
of
the
bill,
and
as
the
icing
on
the
cake,
the
court
relied
on
senator
javits
again
in
the
criswell
case.
but...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
the
exact
number
of
times,
but
i
know
there
is
a
pending
exemption
right
now
that's
been...
that's
been
promulgated...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there...
there
are,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
one
that
they're
working
on
now
is
to
give
employers
greater
flexibility
to
coordinate
their
retirement
benefits
with
medicare
benefits
in
response
to
a
third
circuit
decision
in
the
erie
county
case...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
so
that's
not
just
statutory
authority
that's
never
been
used.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
there's
one
time
where
they
did
enforce
it
and
that
was
a
full
committee
proceeding.
the
decision
was
circulated
to
the
full
commission,
so
that
is
a
binding
decision
on
the
commission.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
but
there
are
only
a
handful
of
examples
that
go
the
other
way
and
with...
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
with
respect
to
the
entire
universe
of
eeoc
decisions,
as
opposed
to
department
of
labor
decisions,
there's
this
one
decision
that
comes
up
in
a
non-benefits
context
where
they
apply
the
regulation.
there
are
three
other
decisions
that
come
up
in
a
benefits
context...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
exactly
what
the
senate
colloquy
said
that...
and
that
colloquy
was
picked
up
in
the
regulation,
which
is
a
binding
regulation
with
notice
and
comment
rule-making.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
there
would
be...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
it
said
there
would
be
discrimination
whichever
way
the
decision
went,
and
i
don't
think
that's
all
that
unusual.
i
mean,
anytime
in
the
title
vii
context
that
you
have
an
employee
who's
fired
for
sex
or
race...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
whichever
way
it
went,
if
it
was...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
somebody
will
sue.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
think,
justice
stevens,
you
could
have
a
presumption
or
a
stereotype
that
older
workers
are
going
to
be
better.
i
suppose
it's
also
true
that
you
could
have
a
situation
where,
for
some
other
benefits
reason,
an
older
worker
wasn't
going
to
have
as
many
benefits
or
would
get
paid
less...
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia,
the
statute,
when
it
was
originally
enacted,
had
the
protected
class
only
between
40
and
65,
so
i
don't
think
the
fact
it's...
now
only
has
a
lower
bound
tells
you
anything
in
particular
about
the
prohibition.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr....
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
thought
you
said
it
well
for
the
court
in
the
consolidated
coin
case
that
this
is
not
a
statute
about
protecting
individuals
against
the
burden
of
being
over
40
or
to
protect
against
over-40-ism.
it
protects
people
in
the
protected
class,
which
is
crystal-clearly
defined
to
be
individuals
over
40,
from
discrimination
because
of
age.
the
act
doesn't
care
if
the
worker
in
the
protected
class
who
loses
out
is
the
younger
of
the
two.
the
act
is
triggered
whenever
an
individual
in
the
protected
class
loses
out
because
of
his
or
her
age.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
