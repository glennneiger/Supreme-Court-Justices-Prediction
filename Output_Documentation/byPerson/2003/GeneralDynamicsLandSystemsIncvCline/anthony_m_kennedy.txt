justice
kennedy
how...
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
kennedy
what...
what...
what
did
it
say
specifically?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
could
call
this
an
enforcement
position
or
an
enforcement
policy
on
the
part
of
the
agency,
and
you're
going
to
probably
say
we
can't...
shouldn't
call
it
that...
but
if
we
could,
doesn't
the
government
get
some
deference?
you
say
it
gets
no
deference
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that...
that's
my
next
point.
the...
the
briefs
try
to
tell
us
that
there's
going
to
be
cataclysmic
consequences
if
we
don't
rule
your
way.
this
safe
harbor
provision
gives
very
substantial
protection
against
that,
does
it
not,
or...
or
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
the
eeoc
taken
an
enforcement
position
with
reference
to
some
of
the
practices
you've
just...
justice
kennedy
or...
or
non-enforcement
positions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
thought
it
was
a
big
deal
when
you
had
your
40th
birthday,
i
mean...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
part
of
your
explanation
about
the...
the
diminished
hurt
to
the
40-year-old
was
within
the...
was
within
the
universe
of
society
as
a
whole,
but
within
the
context
of
his
own
or
her
own
company,
this
is
hurtful.
these
are
people
at
that
age
who
have
younger
children
being
educated
and
so
forth,
and
if
they
find
discrimination
within
their
company,
it
doesn't
help
much
for
you
to
say,
well,
society
as
a
whole
doesn't
discriminate
against.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that...
that
brings
me
back
to
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
it
was
again
reflected
in
justice
breyer's.
am
i
correct
from
inferring
from
your
answer...
i
don't
think
you
said
it
quite
this
way...
that
in
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
regarding
flex-time
and...
and
no
physical
fitness
test,
you
would
say
that
there
is
a
violation
there?
that's
what
i
carry
away
from
your...
from
your
answer
to
her,
and
that
directly
relates
to
justice
breyer's
concern
that
he
just
expressed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well
if...
if
your
submission
is
that
stereotypes
are...
are
deplored
and
prohibited
by
the
act,
how
could
the
eeoc
make
an
exemption
to
the
contrary?
