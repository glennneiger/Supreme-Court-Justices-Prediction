mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
very
essence
of
age
discrimination
is
the
disparate
treatment
of
older
workers
based
on
the
false
assumption
that
productivity
and
competence
decline
with
old
age.
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
protects
workers
40
and
older
from
that
kind
of
disparate
treatment.
it
should
not
be
stretched
to
cover
claims
by
workers
40
and
older
that
they
have
been
treated
disparately
on
the
basis
of
their
comparative
youth.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
they...
they
are,
justice
o'connor.
that
interpretation
deserves
no
deference
for
three
reasons,
which
i'd
like
to
summarize
and
then
first
elaborate
on.
the
first
is
that,
under
chevron,
the
question...
the
question
of
deference
is
not
dependent
on
whether
there's
a
definitional
ambiguity
in
the...
in
the
specific
operative
language,
in
this
case
of
section
623(a),
but
on
what
the...
what
that
language
means
as
read
in
the
context
of
the
act.
and
chevron
says,
using
all
of
the
traditional
tools
of
statutory
construction,
and
applying
that
test
we
submit,
as...
as
i
hope
to
elaborate
this
morning,
one
cannot
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there...
there...
that
this
statute
can
be
fairly
read
to
authorize
the
kinds
of
youth
discrimination
claims
that
are
at
issue
here.
the
second
reason,
however,
is
that
even
if
there
were...
even
if
there
were
ambiguity
in
general,
which
we
submit
there
is
not,
under
the
holding,
the
express
holding
in
mead,
the...
the
eeoc's
regulation
here
is
not
entitled
to
chevron
deference,
and
the
reason
for
it
is
this,
and
this
is
at
page
227
of
the
mead
opinion
in
533
u.s.
the
very
sentence
that
states
the
holding
in
mead
says,
a
regulation
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference
if
it
is...
if
it
is
promulgated
in
the...
if
the
agency
has
been
given
by
congress
the
authority
to
promulgate
rules
with
the
force
of
law,
and
we
acknowledge
that
is
true
here.
but
the
second
half
of
the
test...
this
is
in
the
statement
of
the
holding
in
mead...
is
that
the
rule
has
to
be
promulgated
in
an
exercise
of
that
authority,
and
the
regulation
that
the
eeoc
is
here
defending
today
was
not
a...
a
rule
that
was
given
the
force
of
law
by
the
agency.
in
fact,
the
agency
made...
the
department
of
labor,
when
it
initially
promulgated
this
regulation,
made
a
deliberate
decision
not
to
promulgate
it
as
a
rule
with
the
force
of
law,
but
instead
to
promulgate
it
solely
as
guidance
to
the
public
about
its...
about
its
enforcement
authority
and
it
was...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
because
that
is
what
the
department
of
labor
said
in
the
federal
register
when
it
promulgated
this.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
said,
we
are
promulgating
this
as
a
matter
of
enforcement
guidelines
for
the...
guidance...
so
the
public
knows
how
we
intend
to
enforce
the...
the...
the
statute.
it
did
not
promulgate
a
rule
of
law.
and
then
when
it
was
re-promulgated
by
the
eeoc
in
1981...
and
again,
the
cites
for
this
are
on
page
17
of
our
reply
brief...
when
it
was
re-promulgated
by
the
eeoc
in
1981,
the
eeoc
made
a
deliberate
choice,
which
it
explained
in
the
federal
register,
not
to
have
this
be
a
substantive
rule
with
the
force
of
law,
and
in
fact
it
did
not
comply
with,
and
stated
it
was
not
going
to
comply
with,
the
30-day
notice
period
that
is
required
for
substantive
rules
of
law
so
that...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if...
well,
it
would
get
skidmore
deference,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
christensen
specifically
says
that,
that
it
gets
skidmore
deference
if
it's
an
enforcement
guideline
and
not...
and
not
a...
a
rule
of
law...
substantive
rule
of
law.
but
here,
skidmore...
applying
skidmore,
no
deference
is
due
to
this
regulation
principally
because
it
is
a
regulation
that
the...
that
has
not
been
enforced
in
anything
like
a
consistent
manner.
to
the
contrary...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the...
the
holding
in
mead,
justice
scalia...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the...
the
holding
in...
the
sentence
that's
in
mead
that
says...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
question
under
mead
is
whether
it
was
a
regulation
that
was
promulgated
that...
that
has
the
force
of
law,
and
they...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
not
necessarily.
but
here
they
made
a
deliberate
decision
that
it
wasn't
going
to
have
the
force
of
law
and
they,
for
example,
in
1981...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right,
right,
justice
scalia.
but
they
did
not
comply
with
the
30-day
notice
period,
which
is
required...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
for
rules
with
the
force
of
law
you
do.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
agency
intended
this
to
be
a
rule
of
law
or...
or
guidance
of
its
own
enforcement
authority,
and
it...
and
it
clearly
intended
the
latter
and
it
has
acted
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
fact
that
it's
the
latter
and
not
the
former,
because
it
routinely
refuses
to
enforce
the
principle
that
the
government
is
here
advocating
today.
indeed,
in
every
single
instance
in
which
this
issue
has
come
before
the
department
of
labor
and
the
equal
opportunity...
and
the
eeoc...
since
the
mid-1970's,
in
every
single
instance
the...
the
department
of
labor
or
the
eeoc
has
blessed
a...
an
employment
practice
that
provides
comparatively
older
workers
with
a
benefit
not
available
to
workers...
to
all
workers
40
and
older
so...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
1997
adjudication,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
something
that
can
give
rise
to
chevron
deference,
because
that...
they
were
just
acting
pursuant
to
their
own
view
of
what
the...
of...
of
what
their...
what
the
statute...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
was
binding
on
the
parties,
justice
souter,
but,
of
course,
even
if...
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
under
mead
you
get
chevron
deference,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
for
that
reason,
you
still
have
the
problem,
in
our
view,
which
is
the
more
fundamental
problem,
which
i'd
like
to
address,
which
is
that...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
i
think
the
fundamental
point
for
us
under
mead,
and
then
i'd
like
to
move
back
to
the
main...
the
chevron
analysis,
if
i
could,
but
the
fundamental
point
for
us
under
mead,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
agency
made
a
deliberate
decision
here
not
to
have
this
rule
be
one
that
was
a
binding
rule...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
the
agency
could,
justice
scalia,
think
that
this
had
the
force
of
law,
because
they
didn't
follow
it
themselves
in
the
manifold
in
this
decision
of
which
the
issue...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's...
that's
all
correct
and
we...
i
think
that
does
summarize
our
point
more
strongly.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
going...
i
agree
with
that,
justice
souter...
but
going
back
to
the
main
question
of
whether
you
even
get
to
ambiguity
under
chevron,
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
because
section
623(a)
is
not
to
be
read
in
isolation.
the
fundamental
principle
of
statutory
construction
is
that
it
needs
to
be
read
in
context,
and
the
relative
contextual
indicators
here,
we
submit,
foreclose
the
argument
that
congress
intended
in
the
adea
to
authorize
the
kind
of
youth
discrimination
claims
that
are
at
issue
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
and...
and...
i'm...
i'm
looking
now
at
page
3a
of
the
statutory
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
where
the...
where
provision
is
located.
(b)(i)
is
in
the
statute,
as
the
preamble
to
the
older
worker
benefit
protection
act
states,
to...
to
provide
employers
with
an
affirmative
defense
to
a
charge
that
they
have
discriminated
against
comparatively
older
workers
by
providing
them
benefits
at
a
lower
level
than
comparatively
younger
workers.
and
what...
what
(b)(i)
says,
which
i
take
it
is
the
provision
your
honor
is
referring
to,
is
that,
in
that
situation,
even
though
the
comparatively
older
worker
is
being
disfavored,
the
comparatively
older
worker
has
an
affirmative
defense,
if
the
older
worker
can...
if
the
employer
can
show
that
the...
that
it
spent
as
least
as
much
on
the
benefit
for
the
older
worker
as
it
did
for
the
younger
worker,
even
if
the
benefit
is
less,
and
so
that...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we...
we...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
we
can
shoehorn
ourselves
into
that
provision.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
is...
it
is
still
pending
in
the
court
below.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
do
think
so,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
respondents
won't
agree
with
that,
i'm
quite
sure,
and
i...
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
going
to
solve
the
many
problems
that
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
gave
rise
to
here.
for
example...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yeah...
let...
if
i...
i
think
it
gives
some
protection,
not
complete
protection,
but
i
think
there
are
a
whole
range
of
other
negative
consequences,
your
honor,
that
i'd
like
to
address,
if
i
could,
and
then...
and
i
will
certainly
directly
address
the
safe
harbor
provision.
first,
there
are
a
number
of
employment
practices
out
there
where
the
nation's
major
employers
have
engaged
in
efforts
to
retain
older
segments
of
the
workforce
and
to
bring
back
elderly
citizens
back
into
the
workforce
by
doing
such
things
as
providing
for
workers
over
a
certain
threshold
age,
very
often
55,
the
ability
to
work
part-time
rather
than
full-time,
to
have
flex-time
schedules,
to
have...
to
have
jobs
that
don't
involve
travel.
they've
changed
the
terms,
conditions,
and
privileges
of
employment
for
people
over
a
certain
age
to
keep
them
in
the
workforce.
the
safe
harbor
here
applies
only
to
benefits,
justice
kennedy,
and
therefore,
would
not
protect
that
kind
of
behavior,
and
although
the
united
states
talks
about
the
safe
harbor
with
respect
to
benefits,
i
would
point
out
the
brief
of
the
united
states
is
notably
silent
on
the
question
of
whether
the
interpretation
being
advocated
here
would
make
illegal
that
kind
of
conduct.
and
we
submit
it
would
because
it
clearly
prefers
the
comparatively
older
to
the
comparatively
younger
with
respect
to
terms,
conditions,
and
privileges
of
employment,
so...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
yes,
they
have.
there
are
dol
and
eeoc
letters
which
approve
those
practices,
but
it's
hard
to
see
how
one
could
possibly
approve
those
practices
consistent
with
an
interpretation
of
section
623(a)
that
imposed
a
rigid
rule
of
equality
for
everyone
40
and
over.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
have,
justice
o'connor,
and
this
is
actually
the
second
category
of
adverse
effect,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you
have
if
the...
if
this
decision
stands
and
if
the
rule
of
law
is
what
the...
what
the
government
advocates.
many
of
those
provisions,
which
are
detailed
quite
effectively
in
the
erisa
committee
brief,
provide
for...
for
things
such
as
employees
with...
employee
stock
option
plans,
esop
plans,
are
allowed,
once
they
become
55
years
old,
to
diversify
their
stock
holdings.
employees,
when
they
retire
at
59-1/2
can
withdraw
money
from
their
retirement
plans
without
facing
the
tax
penalty.
there
are
a
host
of
provisions
like
that.
one
point
to
be
made
is
that
it
seems
to
me
irreconcilable
with
the
existence
of
those
provisions
to
interpret
623(a)
this
way,
but
the
other
point
my...
my
friends
the
respondents
say,
yeah,
but
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
because
the
rule
that
the
later-enacted
statute
governs
over
the
former-enacted
statute
will
take
care
of
it.
i'm
afraid
that's
not
so
for
the
following
reason.
all
of
the
examples
i
just
gave,
and
many
others
in
the...
in
the
erisa
committee
brief,
were
statutes
that
congress
enacted
before
1990,
and
i
submit
that
1990
is
the
relevant
date
for
the
later-enacted
statute,
because
it
has...
has...
that's
the...
the
older
worker
benefit
protection
act
was
passed
after
betts
and
it
was
passed
in
1990,
and
it
was
that
statute
that
made
the
adea
applicable
for
the
first
time
to
fringe
benefits
of
the
kind
that
those
regulations
govern.
so
you
have
a
serious
problem,
at
a
very
minimum,
with
respect
to
all
of
those
regulations,
it
seems
to
me...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
say...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i...
i...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
have
a
lot
to
say
about
it,
justice
scalia.
the
first
thing
is
this:
the
critique
that
the
government
levels
at
us
with
respect
to
that
provision
is
equally
applicable
to
their
interpretation
what
they
say
is
that,
you
know,
if
it
were
lawful
under
the
statute
to
grant
a
preference
for
old
age...
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that's
it
not
lawful
to
advertise
for
old
age...
of
course,
what...
if...
if
age
means
chronological
age
here,
then
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
state
a
preference
for
chronological
age
in
an
advertisement,
even
though
it
would
be
perfectly
lawful
substantively
to
have
a
policy
that
said
you're
going
to
open
positions
to
only
people
40
or
older.
so
i
don't
think
they
get
any
mileage
out
of
that...
out
of
that,
because
i
think
they've
got
the
same
kind
of
linguistic
difficulty
that
we
have
here
with
respect
to
it.
and
i
think
what
that
shows,
justice
scalia,
is...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
could
read
it
as
meaning
old
age,
but
i
think
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
word
age
is
something
of
a
chameleon.
it's
a
word
that
is
very
sensitive
to
context
and
it's
going
to
have
somewhat
different
connotations
throughout
this
statute,
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
it
does.
it's
a
different
connotation,
for
example,
in
section
b
of
the
statement
of
findings
and
purposes,
where
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
is
not
talking
about
chronological
age.
it
has
a
different
connotation
in
the
seniority
provision,
which
you
can
find
at
page
3a
of
the
government's
statutory
appendix,
which
talks
about
involuntary
retirement,
down
near
the
bottom
of
the
page,
that
an
employer's
plan
cannot
require
the
involuntary
retirement
of
any
individual
specified
by
subsection
631
of
this
title
because
of
the
age
of
such
individual.
now,
in
a
sense,
that
means
chronological
age,
but
not
in
the
sense
that
my
friends
on
the
other
side
about
623(a),
because
what
it
means
really
is
once
you've
become
old
enough
that
you've
bumped
up
against
the
age
limit,
and
there
are
other
provisions
in
623
in
which
age
functions
in
exactly
that
way.
i
just
don't
think...
i
think
this
really
is
a
case
like
robinson
against
shell
oil,
where
the
word
employee
takes
on
different
connotations
in
different
sections,
like...
like
scheidler,
where
the
word
enterprise
in
the
various
subsections
of
rico
takes
on
different
connotations
depending
on
exactly
how
it's
being
used.
i
think
the
word
age
here
takes
on
different
connotations
in
different
sections
in
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think...
i...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think...
we've
thought
about
it
in
this
sense,
justice
breyer,
and
i
think
it
dovetails
what
i...
what
i
think
is
our
key
contextual
point,
which
is
that
statute
only
protects
people
40
and
older,
and
if
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
a
rule
that
precluded
arbitrary
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
comparatively
old
as
well
as
the
comparatively
young,
it's
an
exceedingly
strange
thing
to
do
to
draw
a
line
at
age
40,
because,
of
course,
people
under
40
are
much
more
likely
to
be
subject
to
discrimination
on
the
ground
that
they're
comparatively
too
young
than
are
people
over
40.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
not
anymore,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
in
any...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i...
i
think...
i
think
that's
the...
the
best
statement
of
the
argument
on
the
other
side
and
i
think
it's
the
government's
effort
to
defend
the
line
on
that
basis,
but
i
don't
think
it
works,
because
the
reason
that
people
40
and
over
have
a
problem
once
they
suffer
an
adverse
employment
action...
and
the
government
itself
acknowledges
this
in
its
argument...
is
because
they
are
then
subject
to
discrimination
on
the
ground
that
they
perceive...
they
are
perceived
as
being
too
old.
that's
the
problem,
and
that's
the
only
problem
the
government
has
been
able
to
identify
that
people
40
and
over
suffer
is
that
kind
of...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
justice
souter.
i
think
that's
true,
but...
but
623(a)
isn't
an
all-purpose
prohibition
of
arbitrary
employment
decisions
respecting
people
40
and
over,
and
after
all,
that
same
kind
of
critique
could
be
made
of...
if
an
employee
is
fired
because
they're
not
fit
enough
or
they
have
the
wrong
color
hair
or...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it...
it
does.
that's
the
only
thing
in
the
voluminous
history
of
this...
of
this
enactment
and
all
of
its
amendments
that
provides
any
support
for
the
government's
view
here
in
response,
but
it...
and
it...
but
it
does
provide
some
support
for
that,
i
agree.
but
i
really
think...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think...
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
it's...
it's
important
to
go
back
to
the
source
for
this
statute
to
understand
what
congress
was
trying
to
do,
the
circumstances
of
enactment
of
this
statute.
after
all,
congress
could
have,
either
in
1964,
when
it
passed
title
vii,
or
in
1967,
when
it
enacted
this
statute,
simply
have
put
the
word
age
into
title
vii
and
had
it
operate
in
exactly
the
same
manner
title
vii
does.
but
it
made
a
deliberate
choice
not
to
do
that.
the
reason
it
did,
i
submit,
is
because
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
labor
in
response
to
the
directive
of
congress
were
that
the
problem
of
age
discrimination
in
the
workplace
is
fundamentally
different
than
the
problem
of...
than
the
problems
that
were
addressed
by
title
vii.
and
the
critical
difference
is
this,
that
the...
the
kinds
of
discrimination
that
title
vii
addressed
was
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
characteristics
that
are
always
irrelevant
to
a
decision
about
who
should
be
hired,
fired,
or
promoted,
or
demoted.
and
what
the
secretary
of
labor
said
is
that
age
is
different,
the
age
is
not
only
irrelevant,
age
distinctions
are
not
always
arbitrary,
and
i
submit
the
court...
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
betts
identified
exactly
that
principle,
that
this
is
a
different
kind
of
problem
warranting
a
different
kind
of
solution.
the
problem
was
that
there
are
stereotypes
that
exist
that...
that...
on
which
employers
act
that...
that
prospective
employees
are...
don't
have
the
competence
or
the
productivity
to
handle
a
job
because
they
are
too
old,
and
that
was
the
problem
that
this
statute
tried
to
address
and
it's
why
it
tried
to
address
it
in
such
a
fundamentally
different
manner
than
title
vii.
context
makes
all
the
difference
here.
again,
and...
and
i
think
the
court
really
did
recognize
that
in
betts.
justice
kennedy,
in
betts,
you
had
the
operative
language
privileges...
terms,
conditions,
and
privileges
of
employment,
identical
in
title
vii
to...
and
the
adea.
but
what
the
court
concluded
in
betts
was
that
that
language
had
a
different
meaning.
in
title
vii
it
included
fringe
benefits.
in
the
adea
it
did
not
include
fringe
benefits,
and
the
reason
for
that
was
because
reading
the
provision
not
in
isolation,
but
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
statute,
it
was
quite
clear
that
title...
that
the
adea
was
meant
to
address
a
different
kind
of
problem,
and
that
there
was
age-based
decision-making
that
was
appropriate
and
not
invidious
and
that
ought
not
to
be
prohibited
by
law.
and
i
submit
that
the
kind
of
age-based
decision-making
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
is
precisely
the
kind
of
age-based
decision-making
that
congress
did
not
want
to
make
unlawful.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
quite...
is
quite
simply
that
people
at
the
end
of
their
working
lives
are
in
a
different
position,
especially
with
respect
to
retirement
security
measure,
which
is
what
at
issue...
is
at
issue
here,
even
than
a
41-year-old,
someone
else
in
the
protected
class.
and
so
when
an
employer
acts,
as
general
dynamics
did
here,
with
the
union,
to
come
up
with
a
solution
that
protected
them
from
a
harsh
outcome
and
protected
their
reliance
interests,
it's
simply
not
anything
remotely
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
when
it...
when
it...
in
the
prohibitory...
prohibitory
sections
of
the
adea.
if
the
court...
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i...
i
believe
it's...
i
believe
it's
a
comparable
number,
but
i
have
to
confess,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
for
sure
what
the
exact
number
is.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
prepared
to
submit
our
case.
