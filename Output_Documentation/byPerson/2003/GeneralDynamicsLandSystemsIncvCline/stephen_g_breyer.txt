justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
leave
me,
can
i
just
read
you
two
sentences
from
mead?
first
sentence
says,
it
is
fair
to
assume
generally
that
congress...
that
congress
contemplates
administrative
action
with
the
effect
of
the
law
when
it
provides
for
a
relatively
formal
administrative
procedure,
which
you
say
doesn't
exist
here.
next
sentence,
that
said,
and
as
significant
as
notice
and
comment
is
in
pointing
to
chevron
authority,
the
want
of
that
procedure
here
does
not
decide
the
case
for
we
have
sometimes
found
reasons
for
chevron
deference
even
when
no
such
administrative
formality
was
required
and
none
was
afforded.
so,
as
i
read
that
last
sentence,
i
certainly
thought
that
if
congress
so
intends,
we
should
give
chevron
deference
to
a
rule
that
has
not
complied
even
with
notice
and
comment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
couldn't
read
mead
as
saying
you
have
to
have
that
or
you
don't
get
the
deference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's...
that's
a
different
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
must
have
thought
of
this
and
tried
it
out.
it
doesn't
work,
but
as
i
was
reading
it
i
thought
perhaps
individual
might
refer
to
older
individual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
i
mean,
but
that
must
not,
but
i'm
sure...
why
didn't
it
work?
because
if
the...
if
you...
if
you
have...
if
you
read
individual
throughout...
cite
(1)(a)(i)
is
older
individual.
the
only
place
it
has
bite
is
where
you
get
to
the
end,
because
of
such
older
individuals...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
thing...
i
see
that
point...
that
one
thing
that
everybody,
i
think,
is
saying
in
one
form
or
another,
is
one
thing
that
isn't
covered
in
2
is
hiring
and
firing
people.
so
every
time
an
employer
dismisses
a
person
over
the
age
of
40,
he
will
either
be
hit
with
a
lawsuit
by
the
older
one,
or
if
he
tries
to
lean
over
a
little
backwards
in
favor
of
the
older...
and
i
don't
want
to
be
too
prejudiced
in
favor
of
the
older
though
i
am
in
that
category...
the...
the
point
is
that
every
time
he
then
tries
to
be
at
all
sympathetic
to
the
older
person,
the
younger
one
hits
him
with
a
lawsuit.
and
so
what
the
federal
courts
become
is
an
employment
court
to
discover
in
each
instance
whether
there
was
cause,
and
moreover,
no
employer
could
possibly
lean
over
even
a
little
bit
favorable
towards
an
older
person,
and
that's
why
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
your...
i
would
say
it...
your
interpretation
will
blow
up
this
act,
destroy
it.
an
act
that
was
intended
to
help
older
people
will
now
suddenly
become
an
act
which
turns
federal
courts
into
labor
courts,
deciding
in
each
case
that
anything
happens
to
a
person
over
the
age
of
40,
whether
the
employer
was
or
was
not
justified.
now...
now
that
is...
i'm
putting
it
strongly,
but
i
want
to
hear
what
i
think
they're
telling
you
on
the
other
side,
which
is
what
i
thought
i
was
articulating.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
they
said
that
they
did
it
simply
to
go
along
with
the
carter
administration's
request
or
requirement
that
even
interpretive
rules
be
promulgated
by
notice
and
comment
rule-making
even
though
the
ada
does
not
require
that.
now,
that's
what
they
actually
wrote
in
their
brief,
and
is
that
accurate?
justice
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
is
accurate,
why
would
congress
have
intended,
and
the
relevant
pages
of
mead
use
the
word
congress
in
one
paragraph
five
times
to
try
to
figure
out
what
congress
wanted
in
this
respect,
why
would
congress
have
wanted
the
courts
to
defer
to
this
kind
of
interpretive
regulation,
which
if
it's
taken
seriously
would
destroy
congress'
own
ends?
that's
a
pretty
tough
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
putting
it...
i'm
overstating
these
slightly
because
i
want
to
elicit
clear
answers
from
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
they're
moved
by
humanity,
or
is
that
an
unfortunate
thing
to
take
into
account
in
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
maybe
they
want
to
keep
this
older
person
around
because
it's
the
decent
thing
to
do...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
younger
person
comes
in
and
sues.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
in
any
instance
in
which
the
employer
quite
honestly
is
moved
by
some
human
feeling
that
is
related
to
an
older
person,
that
the
act
would
rule
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind,
any
reason
to
think
that
it...
that
it...
that
it
really
wanted
in
this
respect,
because
most
human
beings
are
moved
by
these
kinds
of
emotions,
they
wanted
to
prohibit
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
helps
other
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
was
ambiguous,
somewhat
ambiguous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
in
the
colloquy,
could
not
turn
down
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't...
they
were
clear,
turn
down
either...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
choose
the
other.
it
could
be...
can't...
