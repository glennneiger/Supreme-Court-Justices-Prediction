paul

mr.
biggerman,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions?
the
first
question
is,
when
was
the
statute
enacted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i
think
the
sponsor
of
the
statute,
the
secretary
of
labor,
was
a
former
law
professor
of
mine,
so
i
think
it
goes
back
quite
a
ways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
a
good
many
years
ago,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
second
question
is,
what...
what
is
your
comment
on
this
sentence
in
the
district
court's
opinion:
every
federal
court
to
address
the
issue
has
held
that
a
claim
of
reverse
age
discrimination
is
not
cognizable
under
ada
this
suggests
that
there's
a
long
history
of
viewing
the
statute
in
one...
one
way
and
that
perhaps
there
are
substantial
reliance
interests
out
there
that
would
build
up
over
a
period
of
many,
many
years.
would
you
comment
on
that
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
was
that
case
decided?
just
shortly
before
the
district
court's
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
true
though,
as
a
general
matter,
the
courts
had
generally
read
the
statute
the
way
the
district
court
read
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
that
the...
the
business
community
has...
was
justified
in
relying
on
that
rule
for
a
good
many
years?
justice
stevens
you
think
the
statute's
so
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
example
that's
given
in
the
paper
is
the...
the
51-year-old
and
a
42-year-old
are
both
applying
for
a
job
and
no
matter
which
one
gets
it
you
can't
discriminate
on
account
of
age.
how
could
a
decision
to
employ
the
51-year-old
be
a
discrimination
on
account
of
age?
what...
what
would
be
in
the
employer's
mind
if
it's
an
age-based
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how...
how
could
that...
how
could
that,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
be
a
discrimination
on
account
of
age
if
they
hired
the
older
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
decision
to
hire
the
older
person,
how
could
that
be
a...
would
it
have
to
be
just
the
unique
situation
where
the
employer
doesn't
like
42-year-olds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they'd
be
just
in
favor
of
gray-haired
people,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clement,
now,
justice
ginsburg
gave
some
examples
of
employment
practices
that
favor
older
persons,
for
which
i
don't
think
there's
an
affirmative
defense.
am
i
correct
that
there
isn't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
mr.
clement,
just...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
an
answer
to
my
question.
with
respect
to
employment
practices,
such
as
that
described,
am
i
correct
in...
in
agreeing
that
if
an
employer
uses
a
stereotype
to...
to
reach
that
conclusion,
there
would
be
no
affirmative
defense
for
it?
justice
stevens
well,
may
i
ask...
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
similar
question?
to
what
extent
has...
how
many
enforcement
proceedings
has
the
eeoc
commenced
to...
to
enforce
the
reverse
discrimination
aspect
of
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
did...
there
is
one
example
of
an
enforcement
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
all
these
years,
only
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whichever
way
it
went,
if
it
was
based
on
age,
i
still
don't
understand
how
one
could
hire
the
51
because
he
discriminates
against
42-year-olds.
