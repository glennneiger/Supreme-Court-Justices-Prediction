justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that's
a
different
issue,
but
let's...
let's
come
back
to
the
point
of
whether
it
is
promulgated
as
an
interpretive
regulation
or
a
substantive
regulation.
you
are
taking
the
position
that
only
substantive
regulations
are
entitled
to
chevron
deference?
justice
antonin
scalia
only...
only...
only
substantive
regulations?
mead
does
not
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
the
regulations
of
the
sec,
for
example,
virtually
all
of
them
are
interpretive
regulations.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
does
not
equate
with
interpretive.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they
didn't.
they...
they
promulgated
it,
on
page
17
of
your
brief,
as
an
interpretation
rather
than
a
substantive
regulation,
and
that's
what
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
for...
for
interpretive
regulations.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
substantive
regulations
you
have
to.
you
do
not
have
to
for
interpretive
regulations,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
an
interpretive
regulation
does
not...
is
not
entitled
to
chevron
deference
and
is
not
fully
as...
as
effective
as...
as
laying
down
the
rule
of
law
as
a
substantive
regulation.
that's
never
been
the...
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
don't
know
how
often
an
agency
says
what
this
agency
said
here,
that
we
are
promulgating
this
as
an
indication
of
how
we
intend
to
enforce
the
law.
and
you're
saying
there
is
a
chasm
between
rules
that
are
issued
with
that
kind
of
a
statement
and
rules
that
are
issued
otherwise.
the
agency
says,
in
one
case,
this
is
the
law,
and
in
the
other
case,
this
is
how
we
interpret
the
law.
i...
i
don't
see
that
that
makes
the
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
verrilli,
what
do
you
do
with
section
623(e),
which
prohibits
any
advertising
by
an
employer
indicating
any
preference,
limitation,
specification,
or
discrimination
based
on
age?
now,
age
there
could
not
possibly
mean
what
you
say
it
means
in
623(a),
that
is,
old
age,
because
then
it
would
just
prohibit
preferring
older
people.
so
what
do
you
say
it
means
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means
young...
justice
antonin
scalia
in
(a)
it
means
old
age
and
in
(e)
it
means
young
age?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it...
it
still
has
some
meaning
and
some
beneficial
effect
with
their
interpretation,
whereas
with
your
interpretation
of
age,
it
has
no
conceivable
beneficial
effect.
you
have
to
read
it
there
as
meaning
young
age
and
you
read
it
in
(a)
as
meaning
old
age.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
happens
is
that
a
piece
of
legislation
that
everybody
thought
was
meant
to
aid
older
workers,
especially
those
towards
the
end
of
their
working
careers,
ends
up
harming
them.
you...
you...
you
cannot
make
special
arrangements
to
let
them
do
flex-time.
you
can't
make
these
accommodations...
a
very
strange
consequence
of
this
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i...
i
have
to
tell
you
that...
that
as
currently
advised,
that
seems
to
me
so
fanciful
a
version
of
what
congress
intended
that
i
would
not
interpret
the
statute
that
way.
now,
i
will
go
along
with
you
if
you
can
tell
me
that,
with
respect
to
this
ambiguous
statute,
i
am
bound
by
chevron
or
mead
to...
to
accord
deference
to
the
agency's
interpretation.
your...
your...
the
people
on
the
other
side
say
that
there's
no
such
requirement.
do
you
think
there
is
a
requirement
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
you
relying
on?
the
agency
guideline?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
do
you
agree
with
the
description
of
the
other
side
that
that
was
not
promulgated
by
notice
and
comment
rule-making?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
eeoc
during
all
this
period
continued
to
say
that...
that
it
worked
both
ways,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
question
isn't
whether
they're
binding.
the
question
is
whether
the
business
community
could
rely
on
them.
i
mean,
here
are
your...
your...
you
have
this
guideline
out
there,
this
regulation,
i
would
say,
and
incidentally
i
don't
know
why
you
accept
the
proposition
that
interpretive
regulations
are
somehow
different
from
substantive
regulations
insofar
as
their
authoritativeness
is
concerned,
but
you
have
the
regulation
out
there,
but
you
have
the
agency
saying
to
the
business
community
in
an
opinion
letter,
don't
worry
about
it,
we're
not
going
to
enforce
it
that
way,
and
indeed
we're
going
to
amend
the
regulation.
now,
you
know,
what...
what...
what
am
i
to
make
about
that
as
far
as
chevron
deference
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
wouldn't
be
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age.
you
just
like
gray-haired
people.
some
young
people
have
gray
hair.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
be
51
and
still
have
dark
hair.
some
of
us...
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
is
that
authority?
justice
antonin
scalia
who...
who
heard
that
colloquy?
i
mean,
were
they
the
only
two
people
on
the
floor?
i'm
really
supposed
to
get...
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
really
know,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
problem
with
your
stereotype
argument
that
the
government's
trying
to
drive
out
of
people's
minds
age,
just
the
way
it's
trying
to
drive
out
of
people's
minds
race,
sex,
and
the
other
things
against
which
you
can't
discriminate,
is
that
the
government
doesn't
try
to
drive
it
out
of
their
minds,
it
only...
only
over
40.
under
40
it's
perfectly
okay
to
have
these...
these...
these
thoughts
of
age.
you
just
simply
cannot
regard
this
statute
as
a
statute
that
is
directed
against
some
moral
disapproval
of...
of
taking
age
into
account.
