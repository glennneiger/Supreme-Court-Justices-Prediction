well,
mr.
verrilli,
it...
perhaps
you
can
say
that
the
language
in
the
statute,
because
of
an
individual
age...
individual's
age...
is
somehow
ambiguous.
but
to
what
extent
do
we
have
to
give
some
deference
to
the
agency
position
on
the
thing?
because
the
government
is
here
taking
a
position
contrary
to
yours
based
on
agency
interpretation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
that
provision
cover
your
situation,
do
you
think,
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
could
you
fit
yourself,
your
client's
situation,
under
that
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why...
is
that
still
pending
in
the
court
below,
that
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
no
matter
what
we
do,
you
would
take
the
position
that
that
provision
will
cover
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
pointed
to
a
number
of
internal
revenue
code
provisions
and
erisa
provisions
that
appear
to
be
implicated
if
you
go
with
the
sixth
circuit
view
here,
and
perhaps
would
be
in
opposition
to
the
interpretation,
given
the
language...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
the
sixth
circuit.
now,
have
you
commented
on
those
various
provisions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
about
all
the
sections
in
erisa
and
in
the
internal
revenue
code
that
allow
various
provisions
for
benefit
plans,
for
retirement,
and
for
stock
option
exercise
and
so
forth
that
are
going
to
be
at
odds
with
your
interpretation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
there
are
a
whole
array
of
laws
that
will
be
directly
affected
if
the
sixth
circuit
view
is
affirmed.
now,
what
do
we
do
about
all
that?
do
you
think
congress
really
intended
such
a
result?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
unless
there's
a
law
allowing
it.
i
don't
see
one.
i
mean,
there
is
no
provision
unless
you
shoehorn
it
under
this
(b)(i)
section,
that
allows
any
out
for
the
employer,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
the
employ...
well,
i'm
taking
up
your
time.
you
have
only
a
few
minutes
left.
i
just
don't
see
a
provision
allowing
the
affirmative
defense.
