mr....
mr.
verrilli,
i...
i
will
assume
you're...
you're
right
on
the...
the
application
of
mead
here,
so
far
as
the
reg
goes.
what
about
the...
i
think
it
was
the
1997
adjudication?
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
it
binding...
wasn't
it
binding
on
the
parties
before
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
a
different
point.
well,
isn't...
isn't
that
your...
isn't
that
your
stronger
point
that...
that
combined
with
the...
the
relatively
abbreviated
procedure,
they
have,
in
fact,
in
a
number
of
instances
not
followed
it
and
they
have
never
affirmatively,
as...
as
a...
as
an
administrative
movement,
they
have
never
affirmatively
enforced
it.
isn't...
isn't...
justice

which
i
think
goes
to
the
chevron
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
it...
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the...
isn't
the
answer
to...
to
the...
to
the
argument
that
you've
just
made
is
that
as...
as
a
general
proposition,
anything
that
in
effect
interrupts
or
skews
employment
for
somebody
over
the
age
of
40
is
very
difficult
for
somebody
over
the
age
of
40
to
deal
with,
regardless
of
which
way
the
discrimination
is
working?
that
is
not
as
a
general
rule
true
of
younger
people,
and
that's
why
it
would
make
sense
for...
for
the...
for
the
interpretation
that...
that
was
being
suggested,
to
draw
the
line
at
40.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
41-year-olds
are
perceived
as
being
too
old
in
relation
to
people
less
than
41,
and
it
still
means
that
when
somebody
looks
at
a
41-year-old,
they...
the
41-year-old
is
just
not
as
attractive
an
employee
as
somebody,
you
know,
a
year...
a
year
younger
or
two
years
younger.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
says
in
the
colloquy...
well,
leave...
leave...
no,
please
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.

the
first
of
the
two
is
no.
02-1080,
general
dynamics
land
systems
against
cline.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit.
in
1997
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
petitioner,
general
dynamics,
and
united
auto
workers
eliminated
the
company’s
obligation
to
provide
health
benefits
to
subsequently
retired
employees
except
as
to
then
current
workers
at
least
50
years
old.
respondents
are
a
group
of
workers
under
50
who
brought
this
action
in
federal
court
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act,
the
adea.
they
challenge
the
favorable
treatment
of
the
older
employees
on
a
theory
of
what
the
district
court
called
reverse
age
discrimination.
the
court
observed
that
no
court
had
ever
granted
relief
under
the
adea
on
such
a
claim
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
on
appeal,
a
divided
panel
of
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
with
the
majority
reasoning
that
the
adea’s
prohibition
of
discrimination
against
“any
individual
because
of
such
individual’s
age”
is
so
clear
in
its
face
that
if
congress
had
meant
to
limit
its
coverage
to
protect
only
the
older
worker
against
the
younger,
it
would
have
said
so.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
resulting
conflict
among
the
circuits.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
he
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse.
the
common
ground
in
this
case
that
the
adea
forbids
discriminatory
preference
for
the
young
over
the
old.
the
question
is
whether
it
also
prohibits
favoring
the
old
over
the
young.
in
the
abstract,
the
adea’s
reference
simply
to
age
could
be
read
either
way.
the
more
expansive
possible
understanding
does
not
however
square
over
the
natural
reading
of
the
whole
provision
prohibiting
discrimination.
in
common
experience
along
with
the
congressional
testimony,
reports,
and
findings
simply
confirm
that
congress
used
the
phrase
discrimination
because
of
an
individual’s
age
the
same
way
that
ordinary
people
in
common
usage
might
speak
of
age
discrimination
any
day
of
the
week.
that
is
as
showing
that
the
statute
does
not
mean
to
stop
an
employer
from
favoring
an
older
employee
over
a
younger
one.
justice
scalia
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
kennedy
joins.
