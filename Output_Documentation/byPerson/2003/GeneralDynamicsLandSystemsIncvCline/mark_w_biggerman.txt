mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
this
court
should
add
an
additional
element
to
the
adea's
prohibition
language.
and
the
answer,
we
submit,
is
no.
the
adea
prohibits
discrimination
against
individuals
40
years
old
or
older
because
of
their
age,
not
because
of
their
older
age.
petitioner
would
have
this
court
change
that
language
to
require
that
individuals
40
and
older
also
be
relatively
older
than
any
other
group
of
employees
with
whom
they...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
those
are
encompassed
in
affirmative
defenses.
what
we
are
asserting
here
is
simply
whether
the
respondents
have
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
that
would
be
prohibited
subject
to
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
for
example,
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
we...
we...
we
submit
that
congress
set
forth
specific
examples
as
to
when
there
are
exceptions
that
can
be
made.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
what
would
give
the
employer
an
affirmative
defense
to
have,
as
you
said,
a
more...
to
permit...
if
you
could
repeat
the
example?
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
well,
i...
i
think
that...
let
me
expand
a
little
on
my
answer.
i
think
that
congress'
goal
here
was
to
make
age
a
neutral
factor
in
employment.
now,
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
permit
any
special
considerations
for
age
unless
they're
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
i
don't
think
that
the
adea
conflicts
with
those
provisions
because
a
cause
of
action,
unlike
in
this
case,
12(b)(6),
this
case
should
not
have
been
dismissed,
it
should
have
been
allowed
to
go
forward.
and
in
the
employer...
in
any
situation
which
those
regulations
or
those
statutory
provisions
under
some
other
law...
irs...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
i
would...
i
would
analogize
that
to
this
court's
decision
in
mcdonald
v.
santa
fe,
when,
prior
to
that
in
mcdonnell
douglas,
this
court
said...
set
forth
the
first
prima
facie
requirement
as
requiring
a
minority
under
title
vii.
yet
in
mcdonald
v.
santa
fe
it
said
no
because
of
sex.
that
is
when
you
can
sue
like
in
the
age
act.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
i
must...
i
must
humbly
confess
that
i
don't
have
a
grasp
of
the
entire
statute
in
every
situation
in
every
regulation.
i
wish
at
this
moment
i
did.
but
i
would
give
you
the
general
answer,
that
congress
intended
to
make
age
neutral,
and
if
there
were
no
exception,
no
exemption
in
the
statute
or
no
regulation
that
provided
an
affirmative
defense,
then
that
would
be
impermissible
if
it
was
based
on
age.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
i
definitely
think
that
deference
is...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
1625.2
of
the
interpretive
guideline.
is
that
what
you're
referring
to?
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
yes,
which
was
also
supported
by
the
agency
adjudication
in
the
1997
adjudication,
which
was
confirmed
by
the
entire
commission,
which
is
the
only...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
eeoc
promulgated
it
by
notice
and
comment.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
it's...
it's
my
understanding
that
that
is
accurate.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
it
is.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
i...
i...
it's
not
my
belief
that
this
goes
against
congress'
intentions.
i
think
the
congress
set
out
to
set
forth
specific
exemptions,
including
the
older
workers
benefit
protection
act,
in
which
there
are
instances
when
older
workers
can
be
favored,
and
so
therefore
i
don't
think
it
went
against
congress'
intention.
i
mean,
the
older
workers
benefit
protection
act
set
forth
a
whole
bunch
of
additional
exemptions
after
this
regulation
was
already
in
place.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
the
adea?
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
i...
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
it
was
a
good
many
years
ago.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
i...
that
statement
by
the
district
court
was
incorrect.
the
decision
in
the
mississippi
light...
mississippi
power
and
light
decision
had
been
rendered
before
the
district
court's
decision
and
that
was
at
least
one
decision
that...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
no,
your
honor,
it
was
a
little
bit
before
that
and
i'm
looking
for
the
cite.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
as...
as
a...
see,
your
honor,
hamilton
came
out
and
then
all
of
the
district
courts
followed
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
hamilton
without
really
interpreting
the
adea.
they
just
simply
followed
that.
so,
yes,
there
is
a
body.
the
majority
of
the
body
did
go
in
that
direction,
but
simply
relied
on
the
hamilton...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
in
light
of
the
eeoc...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
the
statute
and
the
eeoc...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
not
in
its
only
binding
opinion.
in
its
only
binding
opinion
it
followed
the
language
of
1625.
the
letters,
the
opinion
letters
by
the
secretary...
the
department
of
labor...
and
the
eeoc
before,
those
aren't
binding.
the
binding...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
i
would...
i
would
ask
that
you
look
at
the
top
at
the
commission
and
what
they
did
in
the
binding
opinion,
and
i
think
that
is
what
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
again
i
would
come
back
to
the...
the
statement
that
in
order
to
fulfill
the
requirements
set
forward
in
(b),
reasonable
basis,
you
need
facts.
that's
an
affirmative
defense,
which
we
don't
have.
that
goes
above
and
beyond
a
simple
cause
of
action.
the
employer
could
use
that
as
an
affirmative
defense
to
defend
its
action.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
i...
i
don't
understand.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
am
i
to
understand
you,
justice
o'connor,
that
you
don't
see
a
provision
in
the
statute
that
allows
the
same
affirmative
defense
as
in
this
regulation?
that's
correct.
this...
this
is
outside,
but
again,
it's
the
eeoc
interpreting
the
act.
as
we
all
know,
a
statute
doesn't
cover
every
instance.
does
that
answer
your
question
or
would
you
like
me
to
go...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
okay.
i...
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
the
age
discrimination
act,
the
prohibition
language
says,
because
of
age,
and
this
court
has
before,
in
consolidated
coin,
ruled
that
the
fact
that
one
individual
loses
out
to
another
individual
within
the
protected
class,
it
doesn't
matter.
it's
because...
it's
whether
the
individual
loses
out
because
of
age.
that...
that's
the
critical
thing
here.
the...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
your
honor,
are
you
asking
me
for
an
example
as
to
why
someone
might
want
to
hire...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
congress
found
that
at
age
40
and
over
any
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age
injures
the
individual.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
well,
it...
there
may
be...
the
employer
may
want
a
situation
where
they
want
the
prestige
of
having
someone
with
gray
hair
as
opposed
to
less
gray
hair
for
a
consultant
position
or
for
a
television
anchorman.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
but...
but
if...
if
they
had
a
requirement
in
their
policy
that
it
had
to
be
only
51
or
older...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
right.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
it...
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
but
the
statute...
mr.
mark
w.
biggerman
the
statute
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age.
it
just
simply
sets
the
protected
class
at
40
and
over.
that's
our
argument.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
