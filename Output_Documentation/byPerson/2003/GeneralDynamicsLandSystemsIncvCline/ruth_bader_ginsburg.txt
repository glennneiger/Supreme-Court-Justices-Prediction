justice
ruth
bader

why,
mr.
verrilli,
when
we
have...
what
is
it...
623(f)(2)(b)...
that
makes
an
express
provision
for
older
worker
versus
younger
worker.
if
that
were
the
general
interpretation
of
the
statute,
then
this
specific
provision
relating
to
an
older
worker
vis-a-vis
a
younger
worker
would
be
unnecessary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
verrilli,
it
does...
what
justice
souter
suggested
does
fit
with
the
comment
of
senator
yarborough
that
was
put
out,
that
said
that
the
42-year-old
would
have
a
claim
if
the
52-year-old
were
preferred,
say,
for
hiring
or
promotion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
the
numbers,
mr.
verrilli?
we
have,
i
think,
some
200
people
in
the
class
that's
suing
the
40
to
49-year-old.
how
many
were
grandfathered
in
the
50...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
biggerman,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
relaxed
physical
tests
for,
say,
50
or
over?
as
mr.
verrilli
mentioned,
the
flex-time,
the
reduced
hours
for
people
who
are
well
over
40...
55,
say,
so
that
the...
could...
could
the
40
to
55
age
group
then
sue
because
they
have
to
meet
in
full
the
physical
fitness
requirements,
they
can't
have
the
flex-time,
they
can't
have
the
reduced
hours?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
your
answer
yes,
that
would
be
discrimination?
it
might
be
a
defense
but
it
would
be
prohibited
discrimination
under
this
act
to
make
those
special
accommodations
to
older
workers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
the
affirmative
defense
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
in
the
world
would
that
be
a
bfoq?
you
don't
have
to
be
over
55
to
do
the
job,
quite
the
contrary.
special
accommodations
are
being
made
so
that
they're
able
to
do
the
job.
it
doesn't
fit
with
any
bfoq
decision
that
i
know.
it's
a
very
extraordinary
applicational
definition
of
bfoq,
bona
fide
occupation
qualification
essential
to
the
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you
have...
the
exceptions
are
in
the
statute.
you
gave
me
the
bfoq,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
that
wouldn't
work
in
this
case.
what
else
would
be?
we
have,
as
you
said,
this
would
be
discrimination.
how
could
the
employer
then
defend
against
it?
what
is
there
in
the
statute
that
would
give
the
employer
an
affirmative
defense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
make
special
accommodations
to
older
workers,
no
physical
fitness
test,
shorter
hours,
flex-time,
and
that's
not
available
to
people
who
are
under
55,
say.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
the
regulation
itself
seems
to
have
some
internal
tension,
if
not
inconsistency,
because
what
you're
relying
on
is
what
it
says
in
1625.2(a)
and
then
(b)
goes
on
to
say,
but
the
extension
of
additional
benefits,
such
as
increased
severance
pay
to
older
employees
within
the
protected
group,
may
be
lawful
when
the
employer
has
a
reasonable
basis
to
conclude
that
those
benefits
will
counteract
problems
related
to
age
discrimination.
that
seems
to
be
just
a
recognition
that
the
older
you
get,
the
more
problems
you
have,
and
so
if
you
can...
if
this...
this
regulation
says,
yes,
you
can
give
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
the
hours
because
you
certainly
couldn't
use
that
claim
that
that...
that
maybe
you
didn't
need
this
test.
the
claim
isn't
that
it
necessarily
screens
out
the
older
workers,
but
the
employer
doesn't
want
to
put
them
through
the
strain
of
the
test.
but
let's...
let's
move
to
the
flexible
hours,
reduced
work
hours,
we're
not
going
to
give
those
benefits
to
younger
people
within
the
protected
class,
only
50
and
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
how...
how
in
the
world
could
the
agency
then
adopt
1625.2(b)
that
allows
increased
benefits
to
older
workers
if
the
employer
can
show
that
those
older
people
have
more
problems?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
that...
in
that
very
context,
mr.
clement,
you
didn't
mention
this
court's
decision
in
o'connor
against
consolidated
coin,
where
was
it
the
52-year-old
had
a
claim
for
relief
when
the
41-year-old
was
preferred.
if
i
understand
your
argument,
you...
you
are
saying
that
equally
the
41-year-old
would
have...
have
a
claim
if
the
52-year-old
were
preferred?
