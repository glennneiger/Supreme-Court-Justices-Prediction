unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
part
of
the
problem
is
that
the
pornography
laws
that
would
apply
to
adult
viewers
don't
seem
to
be
enforced
very
well,
the
obscenity
laws.
there
are
very
few
prosecutions,
and
yet
there's
all
kinds
of
stuff
out
there.
what's...
what's
going
on?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
they
were
enforced,
a
lot
of
the
problem
would
be
assisted.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
many
sites
are
there
available
altogether
on
the
internet?
unknown
speaker
yes,
even...
even
the
28,000
was
at
the
time
this
bill
was
enacted.
unknown
speaker
so
i'm...
so
i
assume--
unknown
speaker
--it's
much
greater
now.
unknown
speaker
those
figures
include
the
obscenity
violations
too,
i
assume?
you're...
you're
not
just
talking
about
sites
that
are
affected
by
the
child
protection
act?
unknown
speaker
other
things
too,
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
and
my
first
inquiry
was...
was
such
a
vast
array
of
sites.
there
are
so
few
prosecutions.
it's
just
amazing.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
said
free
porn,
not
free
obscenity.
unknown
speaker
presumably
they
still
can't
advertise
free
obscenity.
we...
we've
drawn
a
line.
unknown
speaker
then
i
don't
really
understand,
but
there's
a
line
there
somewhere
between
obscenity
and
pornography,
right?
unknown
speaker
pornography
is
okay?
unknown
speaker
you're...
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
free
porn
that
you
call
up
would
not
include
any
obscene
material?
unknown
speaker
i'd
imagine
you
found
some
that
it
was
obscene.
unknown
speaker
general
olson,
you
said
something
that
i...
i
would
question.
you...
you
said
it's
just
like
the
blinder
racks,
but
it
isn't,
because
i
don't
have
to
give
my
id
and
i
don't
have
to
be
concerned
that
someone
will
know
that
this
person
with
this
address
and
this
credit
card
wants
to
look
at
this
material.
you
can...
you
can...
the...
the...
the
idea
of
the
blinder
rack
is
to
protect
the
child,
but
at
the
same
time,
the
one
who
wants
to
see
it
doesn't
have
to
disclose
his
identity.
unknown
speaker
how
many
people
are
going
to
be
in
that
adult
store,
bookstore
with
you,
as
opposed
to
giving
your
credit
card
number?
unknown
speaker
but
the
whole
world
can
know
about
it
if
i've
given
my
credit
card
number.
unknown
speaker
then
why
is
there
such
resistance
to
giving
the
id
and
the
credit
card?
people
resist
giving
it,
their
credit
cards,
and
i
think
the
two
reports
said
that
that
was
the
case,
the
reports
on
copa.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
give
your
credit
card
to
go
into
the
nightclub
or
the
movie.
unknown
speaker
there...
there
may
be
resistance
made
there
not
on
the
part
of
people
to
stand
in
front
of
blinder
racks
or
to
go
into
those
portions
of
bookstores
that
are
excluded,
that
exclude
children
because
of
the
presence
of
pornography.
there
may
be
people
who
won't
go
into
that
section
because
they
don't
want
to
be
seen
there
or
don't
want
to
be
seen
standing
in
front
of
the
blinder
rack,
although
they'd
be
happy
to
look
at
pornography
if
it
was
mingled
in
with
everything
else.
unknown
speaker
did...
i
thought
that
at
least
we
have
some
cases
that...
that
recognize
that
there
is...
someone
doesn't
have
to
come
forward
and
say,
i
want
this
material.
that
was
the
lamont
case
where
the
person
wanted
to
get
whatever
was
being
sent
and
didn't
want
to
say,
oh
yes,
i
want
to
get
that
material.
and
denver...
didn't
denver
area
have
the
similar
thing
that
a
customer
doesn't
have
to
say,
i
don't
take
that
stuff
off
my
screen--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
olson,
the...
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
certain
principal
flaws
that
it
saw
in
the
statute,
and
i
wish
you...
you
could
address
those.
first,
whether
there
material
taken
as
a
whole
includes
the
whole
web
site
or...
or
the
article
and
so
forth,
and
you,
i
think,
took
a
different
position
in
the
third
circuit
than
you
took
here.
and...
and
the
second
is
this
question
of
the
definition
of
the
commercial
use.
could
you...
could
you
address
those?
unknown
speaker
well,
just...
but...
but
before
we
leave
the...
the
whole,
what
is...
your
position
changed
between
the
third
circuit
and
here
as
to
what
we
should
look
like,
should
we
look
at
the
whole...
are
you
saying
now
we
should
look
at
the
whole
web
site?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
how...
how
is
the
purveyor
or
the...
the
broadcaster
supposed
to
know?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
we
can't
define
what--
unknown
speaker
--what
the
whole
means--
unknown
speaker
--but
it's
presented
on
a
screen.
unknown
speaker
one...
one
screen
at
a
time.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
as
we
all
know,
this...
this
is...
a
book,
we
know
about
book,
but
the
web
site
is
different,
and
that's
where
we're
struggling.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
obvious
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
because
it
says,
it
says
any
image,
any
article,
any
image.
then
it
could
be
any
image
taken
as
a
whole.
unknown
speaker
the
question
that...
that
i
have
is,
you...
you
have
clarified
what
the
statute
means
in
this
respect,
you've
also
said
that
harmful
to
minors,
the
minor
in
view
is
the
normal
16-year-old,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
and
since
we're
dealing
with
a
content
restriction,
is
it
good
enough
for
you
to
give
a
narrowing
construction
of
words
that
are
susceptible
to
a
broader
meaning?
unknown
speaker
well,
three...
two...
yeah.
no,
it
was
three,
wasn't
it,
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
missed
it?
unknown
speaker
why
did
you--
unknown
speaker
--pick
16-year-olds
instead
of
17-year-olds
if
you
want
to
use
the
old...
the
oldest
minors?
where...
how...
how
did
you
come
up
with
16-year-olds?
unknown
speaker
and
i
mean,
you
know,
maybe
you...
you
won
the
battle
by
losing
the
war.
unknown
speaker
you...
you're
going
to
allow
to
come
in
without
any
restriction
under
this
statute
for
a
5-year-old
anything
that
wouldn't
be...
wouldn't
be
bad
for
a
16-year-old.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
great
victory?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
that?
i...
i
doubt
that
very
much.
i...
i
think
congress
probably
wanted
a
good
deal
of
stuff
that
might
be
okay
for
16-year-olds
not
to...
not...
not
to
be
shown--
unknown
speaker
--to
really
young
children.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the...
the
doing...
the
this
is
having
the
whole
web
site,
and...
and
i,
you
know,
i...
i
concede
it'd
be
a
very
difficult
task
if
we
told
the
congress
you
come...
you
come
up
with
some
definition
of
the
commercial
pornographer.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
very...
very
sweeping.
we...
even
leaving
aside
the
question
of
non-profit
associations
and
so
forth,
people
that
have
these
web
sites
will
tell
you
that
100
percent
of
what
they
do
is
for
profit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
olson,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the...
on
the...
the
meaning
of
this
very
provision?
supposing
a
beer
company
or
a
cigarette
company
used
for
advertising
purposes
regularly
used
material
that
would
fit
the
definition.
would
they
be
violating
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
making
money
out
of
the
sale
of...
of
the
product,
which
itself
is
not
pornographic.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
if
it's
regular
advertising,
you
think
that
would...
that
would
meet
it?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
general
olson.
ms.
beeson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
thought
what
it
said
is
it
picks
up
the
definition
that
this
court
has
used
for
obscenity.
i
thought
that
definition
was
primarily
an
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
and
it
cannot
have
any...
it
has
to
lack,
taken
as
a
whole,
serious
literary,
artistic,
political,
or
scientific
value,
and
it
adds
the
word,
for
minors.
for
a
16
or
17-year-old,
i'm
not
sure
there'd
be
much
difference.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
so,
i
looked
through
all
your
stuff,
or
not
all
of
it,
but
some
of
it,
and
i'd
like
you
to
point
out
for
me,
what
is
the
material
there
that
has
that
serious
scientific
value,
which
you
have
quite
a
lot
of--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
the
statute
would
forbid?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
an
image
or
whatever
image
they
are
that
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest.
now,
that
to
me
is
material
that
does
not
communicate.
unknown
speaker
it
is
material
that
is
looking
for
a
kind
of
emotional
response,
period.
no
communication
and
trying
to
elicit
a
certain
emotion
response,
all
right?
and
it
lacks
serious
artistic
or
cultural
or
other
value,
all
right?
now,
what
is
the
material
that
you
point
to,
because
most
of
yours
i
think
didn't
fit
that
definition.
in
fact,
i
couldn't
find
one
that
did
fit
it.
unknown
speaker
so
i
want
you
to
tell
me
which
is
the
one
that
fits
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
would
imagine
it's
what
we
say
is
covered
by
the
law.
unknown
speaker
you're
going
a
little
fast.
would
you
slow
down,
ms.
beeson?
i
didn't
get
your
last--
unknown
speaker
--clause.
unknown
speaker
did
you
get
my
question?
i
wanted
you,
i
was
serious
in
my
question.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know,
i
would
like
some
citations.
you
don't
have
to--
unknown
speaker
--hold
it
up.
unknown
speaker
but
i...
i
want
to
know
what
you
think,
in
other
words,
are
your
prime
examples,
because
i'm
tempted
to
look
at
them,
and
if
i
thought
that
this
statute
didn't
cover
it,
why
not
say
so?
why
not
say
all
these
things
that
the
aclu
is
worried
about,
given
the
government's
effort,
are
outside
the
statute?
would
that
take
care
of
your
problem?
but
tell
me
which
they
are.
unknown
speaker
exactly,
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
prurient.
i
think
a
discussion
about
sex
is
a
totally
different
thing
from
a...
a
discussion
that
is
itself
supposed
to
be
part
of
a
sexual
response,
all
right?
they're
night
and
day
different.
unknown
speaker
now...
now
you
tell
me
why
that
isn't
so.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
self-censoring.
you're
meaning
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
is
not
warranted
by
the...
the
proper
interpretation,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
thing.
unknown
speaker
if...
if
you
run
that
self-censor,
i
mean,
you...
you
could
not
have
any
laws
protect.
i...
i
suppose
the
laws
that
require
certain
categories
of
materials
to
be
put
in
these,
what
do
we
call,
the
blinder,
blinder
racks,
i...
i
suppose
that...
that's
invalid
on
the
same
basis
because
those
magazines
that
want
to
appear
in
the
general
readership
rack
will
self-censor
them...
themselves
so
that
they
won't
be
put
in
there,
right?
so
all
of
those,
and
i
think
every
state
has
laws
like
that,
they're
all
invalid
because
of
self-censorship?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
we
haven't,
but
what...
what's
your
view?
the
argument
you're
making
suggests
that
they're
all
bad.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
that
alone
is
not
enough,
you
think?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
then
all
the
blinder
racks
are
bad?
unknown
speaker
well,
their
supreme
courts
did,
their
supreme
courts
did.
i
mean,
don't
represent
it
as
a
judgment
of
the
people
of
the
states
by
their
legislature.
you're
saying
that...
that
there
were
state
supreme
courts
that
struck
it
down,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
a...
there's
an
alternative,
the
id,
you...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
credit
card.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
government
says
that
there's
a
statutory
protection
that
they
cannot...
that
the...
the
person
who
gets
the
information
can't
pass
it
on
to
third
parties.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
who...
who
says
that
they're
guaranteed
anonymity?
i
mean,
if
you
go
buy
a
gun,
you're
certainly
not
guaranteed
anonymity.
unknown
speaker
when...
what--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you...
you
say
you're
not
relying
on
what
you
refer
to
as
anonymity
cases
for
this
proposition?
unknown
speaker
if...
if
it
really...
if
it
really
were
illegal,
then
the
stigma
would
be
irrelevant,
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
were
stigmatized
by
having
subscribed
to
poor...
to
obscenity.
you
couldn't
object
to
that.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
have
a
third...
the
third
point.
the
first
is
there's
too
great
a
risk
of
self-censorship.
the
second
is
a
screening
requires
loss
of
anonymity,
and
what's
the
third?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
seems
to
me
just
really
much,
very
much
like
the
point
that...
that
the
statute
sweeps
too
broadly,
there's
a
risk
of
too
great
self-censorship.
that's
really
the
same
point,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
suppose...
what
in
your
opinion
is
the
right
way
for
congress
to
go
about
this?
that
is,
i
assume,
and
you
may
not
assume,
but
assume
with
me
that
congress
is
not
interested
in
susie
bright.
that's
all
fine.
they're
not
really
interested
in
your
examples.
what
they're
interested
in
are...
is
the
professional
pornographer
and
we
know
who
that
is
and
we
know
what
it
looks
like,
and
it's
too
tough
to
go
after
them
with
the
obscenity
statutes
because
they
say
artistic,
whatever
it
is,
there's
a
set
of
reasons
that
hasn't
been
successful.
so
here's
their
solution.
it's
called
zoning.
we
won't
stop
people
from
looking
at
the
worst
stuff
if
they
want
to
and
if
they're
adults,
but
you
have
to
take
the
subway
and
go
out
of
times
square,
or
if
you're
on
the
internet,
you
have
to
identify
that
you're
not
a
child.
now,
we
know
that's
a
burden,
but
it's
far
more
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
to
let
people
look
at
anything
they
want
including
this
worst
possible
stuff,
as
long
as
they're
not
hurting
anybody
else,
and
the
way
to
deal
with
this
is
to
zone
just
like
we
used
to
do
in
libraries.
if
you
want
to
see
the
stuff
that's
locked
up,
you
have
to
go
to
the
librarian
and
identify
yourself
and
show
you're
not
a
child
and
she'll
open
it
with
a
key,
that
used
to
happen,
and
you
could
go
look
at
it,
all
right?
that's
congress'
solution.
now,
if
that
is
not
a
good
solution,
what
is?
is
there
no
solution?
unknown
speaker
your
organization
didn't...
didn't
support
that...
that
statute.
unknown
speaker
also,
what
else,
because
as
you
know
from
things
i've
written,
i'm
very
skeptical
about
the
ability
of
filtering
to
deal
with
millions
of
families
where
there
are
no
parents
at
home
during
the
day
and
it's
very
tough.
so...
so
that's
one.
i'll
look
at
that.
what's...
what's
two?
unknown
speaker
where's
that
at
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
working
what
do
you
do
about
the
solicitor
general's
contention
that
it's
easy
to
turn
the
filters
off?
unknown
speaker
when
they're
working.
do...
do
you
contend...
i
mean,
if...
if
we're
uncertain
whether
it's
easy
to
turn
them
off
or
not,
let's
assume
it's
not
in
the
record.
i...
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
a
good
argument
on
your
part
unless...
unless
you
maintain,
and
perhaps
can
show
from
the
record,
that
it
is...
it
is
not
easy
to
turn
them
off.
unknown
speaker
when
working,
when
working--
unknown
speaker
--when
working.
the
district
court
didn't
make
any
finding--
unknown
speaker
--about
how
easy
it
is
to
disable
them,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
statute...
has
that
statute
been
challenged
yet?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that's
a
good
one,
though?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
you
think
it's
good,
so
we
can
count
on
the
fact
that
that
one's
okay?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
will
demur.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
i
understand
it's
a
lot
narrower.
i've
got...
i
agree
with
you
about
that.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you
don't
stop
before
i've
listed
all
the
alternatives
that
you
think
are
possible.
unknown
speaker
but
why
did
congress
not
think
these
were
adequate?
i
can't
understand
it.
i
mean,
if
that's
so
obvious,
why...
why
didn't
congress
see
that,
that
obvious
fact?
unknown
speaker
screening
existed.
they
certainly
had,
you
know,
you're
relying
heavily
on
that.
those...
those
technologies
existed
and
congress
surely
considered
them
and
thought
it
was
inadequate
for
some
reason.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
back
to
your
first
point
now.
i've
got
down
filters,
i
understand
that,
and
i've
got
the
domain
names,
and
i
want
to
know
if
there's
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
are...
what
are
the
age
limits
that
are...
are
specified
there?
is
there
something
for
the
6-,
7-year-old
group
and
then
up
to
the
15-,
14-,
15-year-old
group?
unknown
speaker
but
that,
of
course,
in
a
sense
is
contrary
to
the...
i
mean,
from
a
first
amendment
point
of
view,
isn't
it
preferable
to
draw
obscenity
prosecution
lines
favorably
towards
free
speech?
and
that's...
i
mention
that
because
that
seems
to
me
the
basic
first
amendment
dilemma
that
i
am
having,
that
it
is
actually
preferable
to
lean
in
the
direction
of
letting
the
adults
go
and
see
anything
they
want,
virtually
anything.
but
that
means
that
there'd
be
some
burden
attached,
and
the
burden
that's
attached
is
the
key
to
the
spot...
locked
room
in
the
library,
the
taking
new
york
times...
times
square
and
moving
it
out
to
yonkers
or
some
place,
and
here
that
you
have
to
identify
yourself
as
an
adult.
that's
the
true
dilemma
i'm
having,
so
when
you
suddenly
say,
oh
well,
let's,
you
know,
launch
a
crusade
against
the
obscenity,
from
a
first
amendment
perspective,
that
might
be
worse.
so
what
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
really
want
that
anyway,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
hard
lines
in
this
area,
and
a
set
of
prosecutors--
unknown
speaker
--who
are
now
determined
to
go,
to...
to...
to
crusade
in
this
area
could
draw
a
lot
of
those
lines
differently
from
say
you
would.
unknown
speaker
but,
just
clarify
it
for
a
minute.
the
reason
that
thousands
are
deterred
are,
one,
they
don't
want
to
self-identify,
and
two,
they're
unable
to
have
credit
cards
or
something
of
that
kind.
those
are
the
two
reasons?
unknown
speaker
would
you
tell
me
your
response
to
general
olson's
argument
that
the
self-identification
problem
is
not
serious
because
there's
a
restraint
on
the...
on
the
transmitter's
use
of
that
private
information?
unknown
speaker
well,
his
answer
to
your
self-identification
problem
is
that
self-identification
to
someone
who
by
law
is
not
allowed
to
pass
that
self-identification
material
on
to
third
parties.
unknown
speaker
but
why
shouldn't
we
uphold
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
see
if
you
rely
on
your
reason
for
deterrence
is
fear
of
self-identification,
and
if
the
statute
makes
that
fear
groundless,
i'm
not
sure
your
argument
is
persuasive.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but...
but
millions
of
users
of
the
web
give
their
credit
card
number
in
order
to
buy
books
or
something
else
that's
for
sale.
i
don't
understand
why
that's
such
a
terrible
invasion
of
privacy.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
beeson.
general
olson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
could
you
address
that
exception
to
the
disclosure
thing
that
ms.
beeson
just
brought
to
our
attention?
unknown
speaker
where--
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
