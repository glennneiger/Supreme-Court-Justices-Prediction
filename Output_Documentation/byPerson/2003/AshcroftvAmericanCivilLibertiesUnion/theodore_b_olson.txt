mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
child
online
protection
act
addresses
a
problem
that
all
three
branches
of
our
national
government
have
repeatedly
and
consistently
described
as
compelling,
the
pervasive
and
essentially
unavoidable
commercial
internet
pornography
that
inflicts
substantial
physical
and
psychological
damage
on
our
children.
copa
was
carefully
drafted
by
congress
after
hearings,
debate,
reports,
and
findings
according
to
explicit
guidance
from
this
court
as
to
how
constitutionally
to
address
and
resolve
and
deal
with
this...
this
menace.
the
compelling
need
is
overwhelming
and
is
growing.
internet
pornography
is
widely
accessible,
as
easily
available
to
children
as
a
use
of
a
television
remote.
this
court
has
noted,
as
congress
has,
that
immense
psychological
and
immeasurable
physiological
harm
is
done.
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it...
in
the
first
place,
justice
o'connor,
while
there
may
have
been
some
lapse
in...
diminution
in
obscenity
prosecutions
a
number
of
years
ago,
the
information
that
i'm
given,
and
it's
not
in
the
record,
is
that
21
indictments
have
been
brought
in
the
last
2
years,
17
have
involved
internet.
but
the
problem
with
respect
to
the
children
is
the
material
that
is
so
widely
available
on
the
internet
that
doesn't
reach
the
definition
of...
that
is
not
as
bad
as
obscenity.
it
is
a
wide
amount
of
information.
the
legislative
history
described
28,000
pornographic
sites
in
a...
this
is
also
outside
the
record,
but
if
an
individual
goes
to
their
internet
and...
and
uses
an
internet
search
engine
and...
and
types
in
the
word,
free
porn,
i
did
this
this
weekend,
the...
your...
your
computer
will
say
that
there
are
6,230,000
sites
available.
now
that's
available
now--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
are...
there
are
a
great
deal
more
than
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
don't
know
the
exact
number,
but
i
believe
the
record,
with
respect
to
the
child
online,
copa,
uses...
describes
those
numbers,
but
it
is
increasing
enormously
every
single
day,
but
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
right.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
so
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
every
evidence
that's
available
to
us,
and
i
don't
think
this
is
disputed
by
respondents,
is
that
the
number
of
internet
sites
is
growing
up
exponentially.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i'm
talking
about
sites
that...
that
would
be
available
to
you--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--to
you
or
me--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--or
to
a
12-year-old--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--by
typing
in
the
word--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--free
porn--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--where
there
would
be
no
screen--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--preventing
the
child
from
getting
to
that
information.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
as
i
said,
the
number
of
prosecutions
are
increasing.
what...
what
the...
what
the,
and
united
states
attorney
manual
asks
united
states
attorneys
to
focus
on
obscenity
where
there's
evidence
of
organized
crime--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
and
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there's
a
line
there
that
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
this...
what
we're
talking
about
today
is
something
that
would
be
described
as...
and
i'm
using
the
term
pornography
as
a
shorthand
version
to
describe
what
was
described
in
the
statute
as
harmful
to
children.
that's
a...
statute
itself
refers
to
obscenity
and
material
which
is
harmful
to
children.
it
then
goes
on
to
describe
the
category
of
material
that
is
harmful
to
children
using
the
language
that
was
approved
by
this
court
in
the
miller
case,
as
modified
by
the
ginsberg
v.
new
york
case
with
respect
to
material
which
is
harmful
to
children,
which
is
broader
than
the
definition
of
obscenity.
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
did...
i
didn't
have
time
to
go
all
the
way
through
all
those
sites.
[laughter]
and...
and...
and
it's
not
a
pleasant--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
it's...
i
didn't.
i...
the
material
that
i
saw
and
i
think
that
the
court
would
see
is
that
the
people
that
are
putting
in...
these
are...
this
is
material
in
front
of,
and
the
legislative
history
describes
this,
the
material
which
is
obscene
is
usually
kept
behind
so-called
blinders,
which
do...
which
is
a
very
good
point
here,
because
the
very
mechanism
that
the
statute
requires
is
already
in
existence
with
respect
to
commercial
pornography
sites.
justice
stevens,
what
the...
what
the...
what
the
purveyors
of
this
material
do
is
put
in
front
of
the
screen
provocative
material
that
we
submit
would
meet
the
definition
of
harmful
to
children
and
make
that
available
to
everybody
to
entice
people
to
go
the
next
step
to
use
their
credit
card
or
their
age
identification
mechanism
to
go
the
next
step.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
you're
disclosing
your
identity,
justice
ginsburg,
because
you're
standing
there
in
public
examining
those--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
you're...
what
you're...
what
you're
disclosing
your
identity
in
person,
i...
we
would,
the
government
would
argue
that
that
is
more
invasive,
but
that
nonetheless
that
there's
some...
this
is
a
counterpart
to
those
blinder
racks.
in
many
of
the
convenience
stores
or
adult
bookstores
or
stores
that
you
may
go
into
where
those
blinder
racks
are,
there
are
cameras
recording
the...
the...
for
protection
of
the
shops,
for
other
reasons,
recording
the
presence
of
the
person.
we
submit
that
in
the
privacy
of
one's
home,
use...
utilizing
this
information
with
the
provision
in
the
statute--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it...
it
is
a...
it
is
a
crime
under
copa
for
the
persons
providing
that
information
pursuant
to
adult
identification
provisions,
it's
section,
subsection
d
of
copa
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
reveal
that
information.
so
there
is
protection
built
into
the
statute
that
protects
the
person's
anonymity
with
respect
to
using
that
material,
which
is
not
protected.
when
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
some...
some
people
may.
congress
made
a...
some
people...
there...
the
numbers
are
not
quantified
at
all,
but
there
is
privacy
protection.
giving
your
identity
is
necessary
going
into
a
nightclub,
going
into
an
adult
movie,
or
going
into
a
bookstore
and
using
this
material.
some
people
may
say,
i
don't
want
to,
that's
a
price
i
don't
want
to
pay,
but
it's
not
quantified
in--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
you
probably...
in
some
cases
you
don't,
in
some
cases
maybe
you
do.
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
charge--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
congress
acknowledged
that.
there's
no
dispute
by
the
government--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
the
denver
area
case,
the
person
had
to
make
an
application
to
unblock
the
material,
that
that
material...
there's
a
big
distinction
in
the
denver
area
case
because
there
wasn't
a
requirement
of
anonymity
and
a
protection
of
privacy
in
the
statute.
but
i
guess
the
bottom
line,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that,
yes,
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
some
burden
that
is
imposed
when
you're
required
to
identify
yourself
into
the
purveyor
of
this
material,
but
that...
but
you
get
to,
you
have
the
opportunity
to
do
that
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home.
by
statute,
a
criminal
statute
protects
the
privacy
of
your
doing
that,
and
the...
and
the
balance
that
congress
struck,
which
is
what
this
court
dealt
with
when
it
dealt
with
this
statute
two...
on
two
previous
occasions,
the
court
did
acknowledge
that
there's
a
compelling
governmental
interest
here,
and
that
significant
harm
is
being
done
on
a
daily
basis.
the
magnitude...
we
point
this
out
on
page
20
of
our
brief...
that
11
million
children
visit
these
porn
sites
every
week,
and
that
between
the
ages
of
15
and
17,
70
percent
of
the
children,
according
to
the
statistics
that
we
cite,
visited
porn
site
inadvertently.
it
is
very
difficult
to
avoid.
as
we
describe
in
our
brief,
the
use
of
innocuous
names,
i'd
mentioned
last
time
that
i
was
here
and
it
hasn't
changed,
[whitehousedotcom]
is
a
porn
site.
many
of
these
things
that
the
evidence
suggest
children
visit
and
visit
accidentally
or
they're
shown
to
by
their
friends,
and
then
it's
very
difficult
to
get
off--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
we...
we
submit,
and
congress
was
basing
its
definitions
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
taken
as
a
whole,
as
this
court
put
it
in
the,
i
think
it's
the
kois
case,
k-o-i-s
case,
from
wisconsin,
and
that
comes
from...
that
comes
from
the
roth
decision
of
this
court,
the
material
to...
for...
for
purposes
of
the
performance
of
this
statute
must
be
taken
not
only
in
its
content,
but
in
its
context.
now,
in
many
cases
it
won't
be
necessary
to
do
that,
but
something
that
might
appear
to
be
harmful
in
one
context,
if
it's
examined
as
a
whole
and
it
turns
out
to
be
a
part
of
an
art
exhibit
or
a
anatomy
book
or
a
sex
education
program,
that
would...
would
have
redeeming
value.
it's
this
court's
decision
that
it's
the
protection
of
the
communicator
that
the
material
be
looked
at
as
a
whole.
congress
carefully
built
that
into
the
statute,
and
your
second
point,
justice
kennedy,
is
commercial
purveyors
of
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you
may
look
at
the
whole
web
site
and...
and...
and
it
may
be
appropriate
to
look
at
the
whole
web
site,
it
may
not
be
necessary.
it
may
be
in
the
defendant's
interest.
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
whole
web
site
should
not
be
looked
at--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
broadcast...
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
this
court...
what...
this
court
has
defined
that.
it
is...
requires
looking
at
the
material
in
the
context
it's
which...
it's
presented.
in
addition,
in--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
presented
on
a
screen--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--certainly,
justice
kennedy,
but
one
page
in
a
book
is
presented
at
a
time,
one
book
in
a
library,
one
magazine
in
a
bookstore.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that's
right,
and
we're
saying
that
the
entire
web
site
may
be
looked
at
as
a
whole
to
see
the
context
in
which
the
material
is
presented.
these
are
protections
that
the
court
think
are
available
and
should
be
concluded
within
the
statute
to
protect
the
communicator.
so
if
the
communicator
is
accused
of
putting
the
material
out
there
that
otherwise
might
fit
these
definitions,
and
the
person
doing
the
communication
said,
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
web
site,
this
was
in
an
art
gallery
and
so
forth
and
those
pictures
were
a
part
of
that
exhibit,
that's
a...
that's...
the
reason
why
congress
put
that
provision
in
there
is
that
this
court
repeatedly
said
it
was
necessary
to
protect
first
amendment
rights,
and
in
ginzburg,
u.s.
v.
ginzburg,
the
court
said
the
context
might
be
considered
in
terms
of
how
the
manner
is
being
purveyed,
is
there
pandering
going
on,
is
it
being
put
out,
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the...
i
have
submit
that
the...
what
the...
with
the
issue
of
as
a
whole
as
a
part
of
the
statute,
taken
in
the
context
which
it
is
given,
it...
it...
the...
this
is...
this
is
part
6
of
the
definition,
which
is
on
page
189a
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition...
that
the...
the
context
of
that
is
quite
clear
that
the
material
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
why
we're
here.
but
the...
the
fact...
and
i...
and
i
submit
this.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
and
it
said
last
year
in...
in
connection
with
the
mccain-feingold
case,
that
if
there's
a
reasonable
construction
or
a
narrowing
construction
to
which
the
statute
is
reason...
readily
susceptible,
the
court
will
adopt
it
in
order
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question,
but
i
don't
even
think
that's
necessary
in
this
context.
the
contact
of...
context
of
as
a
whole
comes
to
this
court
from
the...
comes
to
congress
through
a
series
of
definitions
and
actual
cases
by
this
court,
so...
and
the
legislative
history
is
manifestly
clear
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
this
pace...
case...
is
to
adopt
these...
this
court's
definitions
of
those
things,
and
if
i
can--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--those
were
book
cases.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there's
two--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there's
two
answers
to
that,
justice
scalia.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
the
constitution
does
not
require
impossible
definitions.
what
is...
what
puts
a
person
reasonably
on
notice
is
an
appropriate
way
to
go,
and
what...
the...
the
reason
why
it
was
16
rather
than
17,
of
course,
is
because
this
court
criticized
the
previous
statute
because
it
drew
the
line
at
a
different
age.
it
would
be
impossible,
i
submit,
for
congress
to
select
a
different
age
for
every
different
piece
of
material.
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
was
the
worst
problem,
the
material
that
even
with
respect
to
16-year-olds
meets
the
standards
set
out
in
the
statute.
that
at
least--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
was
very
clear
that
what
it
was
adopting
is
what
this
court
had
previously
considered
in
the
american
booksellers
case
and
those
blinder
racks
and
the...
and
the
definition
that
came
out
of
the
american
booksellers
case
and
the
subsequent
fourth
circuit
definition
of
that
term
in
that
case,
of
which
this
court
subsequently
denied
cert.
those
bookseller
blinder
rack
cases
are
exactly
cited
in
the
legislative
history.
this
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
where
congress
went
through
all
of
the
things
that
the
court
identified
as
problems
with
the
previous
statute,
grappled
with
each
of
these
definitions,
adopted
court-approved
definitions,
standards,
and
limitations
with
respect
to
what
this
court
has
agreed
is
a
compelling
problem.
if
i
can
return
to
justice
kennedy's
concern
about
the
issue
of...
take...
the
commercial
pornographers,
the
statute
is
very
clear
that
it
refers
to
people
that
are
in
the
business
of
profiting
from
this
material,
and
then
the
court...
the
statute
goes
on
to
say
what
is
the
business
of
being
engaged
in
this
and
says
that
someone
that
takes
time,
effort,
or
labor
in
the
regular
course
of
a
business
of...
of
profiting
from
the
transmission
of
this
material.
so
the
legislative
history,
the
previous
iteration
of
the
problem
in
this
court
makes
it
clear
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
and
was...
was
not
trying
to
capture
with
this
statute
the
person
that
occasionally
transmitted
a...
a
photograph
or
an
image,
but
someone
who
is
in
the
business
of
doing
this
on
a
regular
basis
for
profit.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
answer
to
that,
justice
kennedy,
is
the...
the
fact
that
this
is
not
any...
that
that
definition,
what
the
congress
adopted
at
the
suggestion
of
this
court,
was
the
same
definition
that
this
court
had
approved
in
prior
contexts
with
respect
to
obscenity,
18
u.s.c.
1466,
and
that
definition,
commercial
use
of
obscenity,
is
something
that
prosecutors
and
courts
have
been
dealt...
been
dealing
with
for
a
couple
of...
for
over,
well
over
a
generation,
for
several
decades.
so--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
i
believe
they
would,
justice
stevens,
that
if
the
idea
is
to
sell...
to
use
the
material
that
fits
the
definition,
i
keep
saying
the
word
pornography
because
i
want
to
use
the
shorthand,
and
that
is
to
make
commercial
use
of
it
by
making
money
out
of
it,
whether
they
sell--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
i...
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
create
that
massive
loophole,
because
the
people
that
are...
this
is
a
multi-billion
dollar
business,
the
people
that
are
doing
it
would
readily
adapt
to
that
kind
of
a
loophole.
the
other
one
that
was
suggested
by
the
respondents
is
that...
and
the,
and
by
the
third
circuit...
is
that
somehow
congress
should
have
required
that
this
would
be
the
primary
business
that
the
person
was
engaged
in.
again,
that
would
have
been
a
massive
loophole
subject
to
constant
litigation
over
what
was
the
primary
business
and
whether
a
person's
surrounded
the
harmful
material
with
an
acre
or
two
of
unharmful
material.
what
congress
was
getting
at
is
that
people
that
are
in
the
business,
knowing
and
knowing
the
character
of
the
material,
two
other
terms
that
are
in
the
statute,
that
are
making
money
distributing
this
material
and
who
won't
take
the
steps
necessary
to
protect
minors
from
them.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
the
respondents
make
and
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
that
blocking
at
the
home
might
somehow
be
a
problem,
congress
carefully
considered
that,
decided
it
would
not
be
an
acceptable
solution,
except
that
it
did
at
the
same
time
enact...
that
it
enacted
copa,
required
that
the
internet
service
providers
make
that
type
of
information
available
to
people
in
their
homes
so
that
that
could
be
in
addition
to
what
copa
requires.
the
fact
is
that
blocking
material
in
the
home
is
both
underinclusive
and
overinclusive.
it
requires
the
consumer
to
go
out
and
buy
a
product
and
spend
money
to
adapt
it
to
technological
improvements
that
are
happening
all
the
times,
and
it's
readily
avoidable.
i
did
the
same,
this
again
is
outside
the
record,
but
i
did
this,
anyone
can
do
this,
the
same
experiment
over
the
weekend.
i
went
to
google
and
i
typed
in
disable
filter
and
you
push
the
button
and
you
will
get
a
screen
full
of
programs
that
will
tell
you
step
by
step
how
to
dismantle
the
computer
so
your
parents
won't
know
about
it.
it
is
that
easy,
and
you
can
put
it
back
on.
these
things
are
readily
avoidable.
so
the
burden
that
congress
was...
was...
the
burden
that
congress
imposed
at
the
suggestion
of
this
court
is
to
put
the
burden
on
the
person
or
persons
making
money
on
a
regular
basis
from
this
product
to
take
the
minimal
steps
necessary
to
prevent
the
damage
that's
done
every
day
by
minors
by
allowing
people
to
use
mechanisms
that
are
already
in
place.
this
court
mentioned
it
and
congress
mentioned
it,
this
adult
check
mechanism,
that's
another
thing
that...
that
anyone
can
check
out.
type
in
adult...
adult
id,
and
then
press
the
button
and
you
will
find,
i
think
there
were
25
sites
that
mention
in
the
congressional
history
which
will
provide
an
adult
identification
at
a
relatively
nominal
cost,
i
think
it
was
19.95
for
a
several-month
period
or
something
like
that,
and
the
availability
is
such
that
the
steps
that
can
be
followed
take
a
matter
of
less
than
a
couple
of
minutes.
so
in
the
privacy
of
the
home,
the
adult
who
wants
material
protected
by
the
constitution,
in
order
to
avoid
damage
to
children
in
the
privacy
of
the
home
with
statutory
protection
as
to
anonymity,
the...
the
problem
can...
it...
it
cannot
be
totally
solved,
but
this
is
an
important
major
step
and
this
is
an
example
of
congress
following
the
directions
of
this
court
as
to
how
constitutionally
to
do
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
i
don't...
i
don't
read
it
that
way.
i
don't
think
that's
the...
the
exception
is
intended
to...
to
allow
the
person
safe
harbor
by
performing
the
function
of
the
adult
check.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
what
it's
intended
for--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
it
hasn't
been,
hasn't
been
identified
before
as
a
giant
loophole
in
the
statute,
and
i
don't
think
it's
susceptible
to
that
construction.
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
where
justice
breyer
started,
what
would
be
covered
by
the
statute?
the
examples
given
by
the
respondents
were
addressed
in
the
government's
brief
and
all
three
of
the...
all
of
those
examples
we
don't
believe
are
covered
by
the
statute.
susie
bright
is
not
within,
doesn't
fit
within
the
prurient
interest
in
the...
and
would
be
defended
on...
this
is
reminiscent
of
what
the
court
was
facing
in
the
american
booksellers
case,
and
the
respondents
here
were
involved
in
that
one
as
an
amicus,
were
16
examples
were
cited
as
the
house
was
going
to
fall
down,
the
sky
was
going
to
fall.
this
court
decided
to
remand
that
to
the...
the
virginia
supreme
court
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
found
that
none
of
the
16
parade
of
horribles
would
be
even
covered
by
the
statute.
that's
this
all
over
again,
and
it
flies
in
the
face
of
the
requirement
by
this
court
to
find
a
reasonable,
a
construction
of
the
statute
that
would
be,
to
which
it
would
be
reasonably
susceptible
that
would
deal
with
those
constitutional
problems.
and...
and
these
definitions,
these
definitions
have
already
been
approved
with
respect
to
minors
in
the
ginsberg
v.
new
york
case,
so
we're
not...
and
that's
a
couple
of...
several
decades
ago,
so
we're
not
dealing
with
something
that
is
brand
new.
susie

by
the
way,

2
of

you

you

the...
the
deterrence
issue,
all
of
the...
all
of
the...
all
the
court
of...
the
lower
courts
decided
is
that
some
people
may
be
deterred,
may
be
deterred,
and
some
people
may
be...
find
this
as
an
impediment.
some
people
may
engage
in
self-center...
self-censorship,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
are
thousands
of
people,
that's
an
infinitesimal
quantity
of
what's
on...
on
the
web
in
itself.
the
most
important
point
here,
with
respect
to
alternatives,
congress
considered,
as
this
court
suggested
it
should,
the
various
alternatives.
the
house,
the
senate
report's
good,
but
the
house
report,
775,
which
is
cited
all
over
the
briefs
on
pages
16
through
20
considered
all
of
these
examples,
the
tagging,
the
filtering
and
so
forth
and
went
through
all
of
the
reasons
why
congress
found
that
they
would
not
be
effective
and
that
what
copa
was
providing
would
be
effective,
that
there
were
costs,
the
burden
should
be
on
the
commercial
purveyor
of
the
material
and
so
forth.
congress
went
through
all
of
these
things
and
made
specific
findings.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it's
important
to
emphasize
this
is
a
facial
challenge
to
a
statute
constructed
according
to
this
court's
guidance,
according
to
this
court's
decisions
as
to
how
to
deal
with
a
very
serious
national
problem.
it
contains
a
scienter
requirement
the
purveyor
of
this
material
must
know
what's
being
done,
he
must
be
engaged
in
the
regular
course
of
business,
and
i
can't
recall...
i
think
it
was
you,
justice
breyer...
who
asked
the
question,
how
else
could
congress
have
done
it?
this
is
a
national
problem.
it's
serious.
it's
causing
irreparable
injury
to
our
most
important
resource,
our
children.
congress
has
been
struggling
with
this.
it
listened
to
what
this
course
had...
court
had
to
say.
it
examined
the
nature
of
the
medium,
because
this
is
a
different
medium,
but
one
of
the
wonderful
things
about
this
medium
is
also
the...
one
of
the
potentially
dangerous
parts
of
this
medium.
it's
easily
accessible
to
children
in
the
home
and
it's
important
that
the
government
be...
this
nation
and
its
three
branches
of
government
be
concerned
with
the
care
and
welfare
of
children
independent
of
the
parents'
responsibility.
so
this
is
an
example
of
a
serious
national
problem,
congress
following
conscientiously
this
court's
guidance
as
to
how
to
solve
the
problem
and
then
laying
it
out
for
this
court
as
to
how
it
did
so,
and
it
came
up
with
this
statute,
which
is
constitutional.
