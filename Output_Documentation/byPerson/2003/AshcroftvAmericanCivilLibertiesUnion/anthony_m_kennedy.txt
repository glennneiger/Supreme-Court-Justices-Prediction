justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
presents
a
challenge
to
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
to
protect
miners
from
exposure
to
sexually
explicit
material
on
the
internet.
the
statute
is
the
child
online
protection
act
and
the
abbreviation
for
that
act
is
copa,
and
is
referred
to
as
copa.
copa
prohibits
the
posting
to
the
world
wide
web
the
materials
that
are
harmful
to
minors.
it
does
provide
an
affirmative
defense
for
content
providers
who
use
age
verifying
technology
to
restrict
access
to
their
web
sites.
copa
is
congress’
second
attempt
to
make
the
internet
safe
for
minors
by
criminalizing
certain
speech.
the
first,
the
communications
decency
act
was
invalidated
by
this
court
in
1997.
in
enacting
copa,
congress
gave
consideration
to
that
case
and
to
our
other
decisions
in
this
area.
so,
we
must
proceed
with
caution
and
care
before
invalidating
copa.
the
imperative
of
the
court
in
respect
to
congress
however,
does
not
permit
us
to
depart
from
well-established
first
amendment
principles.
instead,
we
must
hold
the
government
to
its
constitutional
burden
of
proof.
content
based
prohibitions
enforced
by
criminal
penalties
have
a
constant
potential
to
be
a
repressive
force
in
the
lives
and
thoughts
of
the
free
people.
to
guard
against
that
threat,
the
constitution
requires
that
content
based
restrictions
on
speech
be
presumed
invalid.
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
showing
their
constitutionality.
now,
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
certiorari
review
of
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
and
the
appeal
to
that
court
was
from
the
district
court’s
decision
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reviewed
that
decision
for
abuse
of
discretion.
under
that
standard,
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
to
conclude
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
of
discretion
in
granting
the
preliminary
injunction.
in
affirming
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
a
number
of
respondent’s
challenges
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
in
the
opinion
filled
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today
however,
we
concentrate
on
one
ground
and
this
was
the
ground
primarily
relied
on
the
district
court.
and
that
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
are
less
restrictive
alternatives
to
the
statutory
scheme.
the
government
has
failed
at
this
point
to
carry
its
burden
to
rebut
the
respondent’s
contention
that
there
are
plausible
less
restrictive
alternatives
to
the
statute.
in
particular,
the
government
has
failed
to
show
that
blocking
and
filtering
software
is
not
a
less
restrictive
alternative
than
the
criminal
prohibitions
in
copa.
filters
are
less
restrictive
because
they
impose
selective
restrictions
at
the
receiving
computer
rather
than
blanket
propositions
of
the
source
and
because
they
do
not
criminalize
speech,
they
also
may
be
more
effective
than
copa.
for
example,
a
commission
appointed
by
the
congress
in
copa
itself,
has
concluded
that
filters
are
more
effective
that
the
verification
technologies
that
the
copa
requires.
whether
or
not
filters
are
in
fact
more
effective
than
the
restrictions
implemented
by
copa
however,
the
government
at
this
point
has
not
met
its
constitutional
burden
of
showing
hat
they
are
significantly
less
so.
the
government
having
failed
to
carry
its
constitutional
burden
of
proof,
it
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
grant
the
preliminary
injunction.
in
addition,
substantial
practical
considerations
support
our
decision
to
affirm
the
preliminary
injunction
and
remand
for
trial.
remand
will
allow
the
introduction
of
further
evidence
on
the
relative
effectiveness
of
alternative
to
copa.
the
district
court
can
also
consider
technological
and
legal
developments
that
have
occurred
in
the
time
since
the
district
court
originally
entered
the
preliminary
injunction
to
take
just
one
example.
in
the
time
since
the
district
court
made
its
fact
findings,
the
growth
of
the
internet
has
been
rapid
with
a
number
of
internet
host
computers
increasing
from
36.7
million
to
233.1
million
today.
for
these
reasons,
we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joins;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
o’connor
join.
