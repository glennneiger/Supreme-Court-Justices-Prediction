ms.
ann
e.
beeson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
copa
violates
the
first
amendment
for
two
independent
reasons.
first,
it
is
a
criminal
statute
that
suppresses
a
wide
range
of
protected
speech
between
adults
on
the
web,
and
second,
the
government
has
a
range
of
more
effective,
less
restrictive
tools
available
to
protect
minors.
the
government's
attempt
to
narrow
the
range
of
speech
that
is
affected
by
this
statute
defy
the
law's
plain
language,
the
record,
and
plain
common
sense.
even
under
the
government's
interpretation,
copa
criminalizes
speech
that
under
any
definition
adults
have
the
right
to
access.
it
criminalizes
a
depiction
or
even
a
description
of
nudity
or
even
a
description
or
depiction
of
the
female
breast.
it
does
not
just
cover
sexual
conduct.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--yes.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes.
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
the
obscenity
statute
actually
covers
only
sexual
conduct.
it
does
not
cover
mere
depictions
of...
of
nudity
and
it
does
not
cover
just
an
image
of
the
female
breast,
so
i
think
that
that's
an
important
difference.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--yes,
and,
your
honor,
the
question
ultimately
is
what
a
speaker
on
the
web
who
communicates
material
like
this
will
do,
what
they
think
is
covered
by
the
law,
whether
they
will
self-censor
everything
they
think--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
so,
under
this
court's
precedents.
in
other
words,
if
the...
if
the
record
shows,
and
if
the
law
covers,
material
that
clearly
has
value
for
adults
but
lacks
value
for
minors,
there
has
to
be
some
distinction
there
or
otherwise
this
turns
into
the
obscenity
statute.
there
is
no
difference.
in
other
words,
there
is
material
that
has--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--sure.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
sure,
sure,
your
honor,
of
course.
the
point
is
that
the
serious
value
for
minors
clause
does
not
protect
as
much
material
as
the
serious
value
for
adults
clause
in
the
obscenity
statute.
that
by
definition
must
be
true,
and
in
fact,
as
a
society,
just
even
using
common
sense--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--yes.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
absolutely.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes,
let
me
do
that.
first,
there
are
numerous
discussions
in
the...
in
the
record
of
lesbian
and
gay
sexual
pleasure
and
the
pleasure
of
sex
outdoors.
this
is
not
sex
education
materials.
these
are
materials
intended
for
adults
which
explicitly
discuss
sexual
pleasure.
let
me
give
a
few
citations:
planetout,
in
the
joint
appendix,
658
to
69;
blackstripe,
the
joint
appendix,
753
to
57;
and
the
susie
bright
column.
she
is
a
sex
therapist,
she
is...
she
talks
about
sexual
pleasure.
she
is
not
talking
about
educational
material.
the
purpose
of
her
columns
are
to
invite
adults
to
discuss
and
to
read
about
sexual
pleasure
if
they
want--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your
honor,
let
me
put
this
another
way.
this
statute
covers
written
text.
all
of
the
exhibits
that
have
been
put
in
by
the
government
are
of
images.
i
don't
know
what
else
could
be
covered
that
is
written
text
that,
you
know,
other
than
our
client's
material,
in
other
words,
what
is
left.
that
is
what
they
are.
they
are...
they
are
prurient
discussions,
they
are
intended
for
adults,
they
have
value
for
adults,
but
they
lack
value
for
minors.
that
is
the
concern.
it's
a
very
big
concern.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
on
the
web
that
communicate
that.
and
as
a
society,
again,
there's
a
lot
of
material
in
this,
we
have
defined
a
wide
range
of
material
as
having
value
for
adults
and
lacking
value
for
even
older
minors.
a
16-year-old
cannot
get
into
an
r-rated
movie.
if
you're
a
speaker
on
the
web
and
you
communicate
material
that's
like
bertolucci
films,
for
example,
or
sex
and
the
city,
you
are
going
to
be
very,
very
worried.
the
government
has
made
your
speech
a
crime
and
you
have
only
three
options
under
the
statute.
all
of
those
options
violate
the
first
amendment.
the
first
option
is
that
you
can
take
a
risk
and
leave
your
speech
up
there,
justice
breyer,
as
you're
saying,
you
know,
leave
it
up
there.
you're
susie
bright
and
you
think
that
your...
your
speech
is
not
covered.
what
happens?
you
can
go
to
jail,
not
because
you
made
that
column
deliberately
available
to
a
minor,
but
because
you
merely
displayed
the
column
to
the
general
public.
that
is
a
pure
violation
of
this
court's
rule
in
butler
v.
michigan
that
you
cannot
make
it
a
crime
to
display
material
to
adults
in
the
name
of
protecting
children.
the
second
option.
you're
worried,
you
don't
want
to
go
to
jail,
you
self-censor.
everything
that
you
have
self-censored,
adults
had
the
right
to
access.
it
violates
the
first
amendment
for
the
government
to
do
this
through
the
statute.
the
third
option
is
that
you
can
set
up
costly
screens,
which
the
record
shows
drive
away
your
users.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
specifically
found
that
because
of
the
risk
of
criminal
penalties,
it's
quite
likely
that
you
never
get
to
the
defenses
because
the
vast
majority
of
rational
speakers,
when
faced
with
this
choice,
are
going
to
self-censor,
and
that
is
speech
that
adults
had
the
right
to
get.
this
court,
for
that
reason--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--no,
i'm
not.
i...
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
very
different
than
the...
than
that
problem,
the
self-censorship
problem
with
the
obscenity
statute,
and
here's
why.
under
the
obscenity
statute,
if
you
self-censor
material
that
is
actually
obscene,
there's
no
first
amendment
problem.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
exactly.
there's
no
first
amendment
problem.
that
speech
is
illegal.
if
you
self-censor
speech
under
copa
that
we
can
all
agree
is
harmful
to
minors,
whatever
that
is,
it's
harmful
to
minors,
you
have
self-censored
material
that
adults
have
the
right
to
access.
that's
the
fundamental
difference,
and
that
is
why
this
self-censorship
is
problem
with
this
statute
is
so
much
broader
than
it...
than
it
could
ever
be
in
the
obscenity
statute.
now,
you
also
have--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your
honor,
we
think
that...
first
of
all,
this
court
has
never
upheld
an...
a
harmful
to
minors
display
statute,
and
in
fact--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--we
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
three
first
amendment
burdens
that
these
kinds
of
statutes
impose.
the
first
one
is
the
self-censorship
problem.
the
second
one--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--we
think
that
it
would
be
enough--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--but
the
point
is
under
copa--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--and
under...
under
this
law...
under
this
law,
your...
your
honor,
there
are
two
additional
burdens
which
are
much
greater
than
the
online
blinder
rack
statutes,
and
in
fact,
it's
quite
notable
that
even
though
some
states,
it's
about
half
of
the
states
that
have
display
statutes
as
opposed
to
statutes
like
ginsberg
that
make
it
a
crime
to
simply
sell
directly
to
a
child
material
that's
harmful
to
minors,
those
same
states
that
have
passed
and
in
some
cases
upheld
offline
display
statutes
have
now
struck
down
online
display
statutes
because
they
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
that
the
district
court
and
the
appellate
court
in
this
case
found
and
that
is
that
there
is--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--i'm
saying
that
there
are...
there
were
federal
courts
that
have
struck
down
now
seven
state
online
harmful
to
minor
statutes
because
they
have
recognized
the
distinction
between
those
statutes
in
the
online
context
and
the
offline
context,
and
let
me
just
get
to
that
second
problem,
you
know,
self-censorship
being
the
first
problem,
self-censorship
of
speech
that
under
any
definition
is
protected
for
adults.
the
second
one,
the...
let's
just
assume
that
you...
that
you
want
to
go
ahead
and
try
to
set
up
these
screens,
first
of
all,
a
credit
card
is
a
form
of
payment,
it
is
not
an
id.
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
flashing
your
id
if
you're
a
young-looking
adult
and
the
bookstore
owner
is
not
quite
sure
that
you're...
you're
an
adult
yet.
this
is
a
matter
of
every
single
adult
having
to...
to
provide
their
credit
card
to
a
web
site
every
time
they
visit
a
new
web
site.
the--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your
honor,
there
is
an
alternative
in
the
statute.
what
the
record
shows
is
that
to
get
an
adult
id,
the
primary
way
to
get
that
is
through
a
credit
card.
so
another
problem
you
have
very
similar
to
the
problem
identified
by
this
court
in
reno
v.
aclu
is
that,
you
know,
almost
all
adults
without
credit
cards
have
no
way
to
access
this
speech
at
all,
and
again,
you
don't
even...
you
don't
even
get
to
this
problem
if,
of
course,
the
web
speaker
has
chosen
the
first
option
and
has
self-censored
and
not
even
tried
to
set
up
the
screens.
so
the
other...
the...
the
other
thing
that's
very
different,
of
course,
about
the
blinder
rack
statutes
is
that
none
of
them
required
the
adults
to
actually
register
or
disclose
their
identity.
credit
cards
create
a
permanent
transaction,
a
permanent
record
of
the
transaction,
and
the...
the
potential
for
abuse,
because
they
are
a
form
of
payment,
is
much
greater
than
merely
flashing
an
id.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
there
was
actually...
there
actually
was
a
similar
protection
in
the
denver
area
case,
which
this
court
found
irrelevant
given
the
remaining
burden
on...
on
adults
having
to
identify
themselves
before
they
seek
access.
in
both
the
denver
area
case
and
in
the
playboy
case,
this
course...
court...
struck
down
very
similar
burdens
on
adult
speech.
the
burden
here
is
much
greater
because
the
quantity
and
diversity
of
speech
affected
is
much
greater
and
the
number
of
users
affected
is
greater.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
there's--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--a
fairly
big
loophole
in
that
privacy
protection,
which
is...
which
is
right
in
the--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your
honor,
the
anonymity...
there
actually...
this
court
has
held,
of
course,
that
there
is
a
right
to
access--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--protected
speech
anonymously,
but
that
is
not
really
what's
at
issue
here.
what's
at
issue
is
what
the
effect
of
the
law
is
on
protected
speech
for
adults,
and
what
the
anonymity
cases
show
is
that
if
you
have
to
give
up
your
anonymity,
a
lot
of
people
are
going
to
be
deterred,
and
that's
what
the
record
in
this
case
shows
too.
general
olson
acted
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
about
the
number
of
times.
in
fact,
there
is
quite
a
lot
in
the
record.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i'm
saying
that
i
think
that
those
cases
are
relevant
only
to
the
extent
that
they
show
that
anonymity
often
deters...
that
the...
the
loss
of
anonymity
will
deter
viewers.
here
there
is
evidence,
and
it
isn't
even
just
the...
the
loss
of
anonymity
that's
the
problem,
it's
also
the
stigma
of
being
associated
with
material
that's
been
labeled
by
the
government
as
illegal,
and
that
was
a
stigma
that
the
court
also
found
relevant
in
striking
down
the
denver
area
case.
i
wanted
to
just
quick--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--the...
the...
if
it
were
illegal
to?
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
no,
no,
no.
but
here,
again,
the...
the
speech
is
protected
for
adults.
they
have
the
right
to
access
as...
as
the
court
held
in
lamont
and
in
denver
area
and
in
playboy.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
the...
the
third
was
the
four...
first
point
i
made,
your
honor,
which
is
that
if
you...
the
defenses
don't
help
you
at
all
if
you
take
a
risk
and...
and
assume
that
your
speech
is
protected
and
in
fact
the
government
thinks
it
isn't.
you
know,
you're
susie
bright,
you
put
the
column
up,
you
think
it's,
you
know,
you
think
it's
okay.
the
defenses
don't
help
you
and
you're
going
to
jail,
not
because
you
gave
it
deliberately
to
a
child,
but
because
you
displayed
it
to
an
adult.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
think
it
is
the
same
point.
i
really
think
it's
a...
it's
a
very
distinct
point,
because
the
point
is
the
speaker
has
two
choices.
they
can
either
take
a
risk
and
display
the
speech,
in
which
case
they
go
to
jail.
they
go
to
jail
not
because
they
gave
it
to
a
child,
that's
the
only
kind
of
a
statute
this
court
has
upheld.
that's
the...
that's
what
they
upheld
in
ginsberg
is
that
you
can
make
it
a
crime
to
deliberately
sell
this
material
to
the
child.
all
the...
all
the...
all
the
web
publisher
has
done
under
this
statute
that
sends
him
to
jail
is
to
simply
make
it
available
to
the
general
reading
public.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes,
there
are
a
number
of
solutions
which
congress
has
now
passed
which
don't
present
the...
the
problems
that
this
statute
does.
this
is
not
a
zoning
statute,
it's
a
criminal
statute,
and
because
it's
a
criminal
statute
it's
far
more
likely
to
lead
to
the
self-censorship
that...
that
causes
the
big
problem
here.
we
now
have
a
federal
filtering
law
that
this
court
upheld,
so
any
child
that's
accessing
the
internet
in
a
school
or
a
public
library
has
already...
is
protected
from
most
of
these
images.
one
of
the
most...
one
of
the
important
cites
in
the
record
that
i
want
to
mention
here,
the
government
put
in
more
exhibits--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--i'm
sorry.
[laughter]
yeah.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
if
i
could
just
mention
the
cite
to
the
record,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it's
very
important.
the
government
put
in
a
lot
of
sexually
explicit
images
as
their
exhibits
in
this
case.
they
stipulated
that
every
one
of
the
major
filtering
products
blocked
every
one
of
the
images
that
they
submitted
as
being
a
problem
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix
beginning
at
page
170,
that's
the
joint
stipulation
between
the
parties,
numbers
45
to
47.
that
is
a
pretty
ringing
endorsement
for
filtering
software,
and
again,
the
district
court
specifically
found--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your
honor,
first
of
all,
that
is
not
in
the
record.
what
the
record
shows
and
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
the
filters
are
more
effective
than
copa,
and
the
reason
that
they're
more
effective--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your...
your
honor,
under
this
court's
long-standing
precedents,
any
content-based
regulation
of
speech
is
presumptively
invalid.
it
is
the
government's
burden
to
show
that
there
is
no
less
restrictive
alternative,
and
they
did
not
meet
this
burden
under
the
clear
record
in
this
case.
the
district
court
very
clearly
found
that
the
filters
were
at
least
as
effective.
they
can
actually
block
material
that
is
not
even
commercial
that
comes
from--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--foreign
web
sites.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
but--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--because
the
government
didn't
put
on
any
evidence,
which
is
why
he
said
he
had
to
go
outside
the
record
to
make
that
point,
when
we
have
only
the
record
to...
to
base
the
decision
on
here.
justice
breyer,
to
get
to
the
other
options
that
are
available,
the
other
things
that
congress
can
do,
one
that
i
want
to
mention
is
a
new
statute
that
was
passed,
18
u.s.c....
i
believe
it's
2252(b)...
it
gets
at
the
[whitehousedotcom]
problem.
this
is
a
law
that
penalizes
sites
that
knowingly
use
misleading
domain
names,
like
[whitehousedotcom,]
in
order
to
lure
children
to
this
sites
inadvertently.
that
is
another
law--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--that...
that
statute
has
not
been
challenged.
it
is
on
the
books
now,
and...
and
therefore
it
is--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--it
is
certainly
narrower,
your
honor,
than
this
statute.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i
will
argue
only
that
it's--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--clearly
narrower.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
it's
narrower,
all...
all
jokes
aside,
is
because
it
gets
more
clearly
at...
at
what
the
statute
is
aiming
to
get
at,
which
is,
you
know,
luring
inadvertent
viewers,
especially
minors,
to
particular
sites,
whereas
this...
this
law
makes
it
a
crime
for
anyone,
any
individual
running
a
small
business,
you
know,
mitch
tepper,
our
client
who
runs
a
sexual
health
network--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--yes,
your
honor,
and
thank
you
for
returning
me
to
my...
to
my
task
there.
another
one
is
a
law
that
was
passed
the
same
time
that
copa
was
passed...
passed,
which
requires
internet
service
providers
to
give
all
customers
information
about
their
filters.
another
misconception
i
think
left
by
general
olson,
you
don't
have
to
go
out
and
buy
another
product.
the
record
shows
that
all
of
the
major
filtering,
all
of
the
major
internet
service
providers
provide
these
parental
controls
as
a...
as
a
default
for
parents.
when
you...
when
you
set
up
your
account
with
aol,
it
asks
you
right
then
and
there,
you
don't
have
to
pay
extra,
whether
you
want
to
install
the
parental
controls.
there
is
also
a
new
law--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your
honor,
part
of
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
most
of
these
laws
that
i'm
mentioning
were
passed
after
copa
was
passed.
copa
was
passed
very
early
on
in
this
debate
when
the
internet
was
not
as
well
understood
as
it
is
now.
frankly,
the...
the
solutions
that
it
has
thought
up
since
then
have
been
better,
they've
been
narrower,
and
they
have
had
less--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your
honor,
the
record
in
the
case
shows
that
it's
at
least
as
adequate
and
where,
as
here,
there's
a
record
that
shows
that
there
is
a
broad
chilling
effect
on
protected
speech
for
adults
because
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
those...
those
tools
are...
are--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--yes.
there
are
two
other
points
i
would
like
to
make
on
that.
one
is
there's...
congress
has
now
created
something
called
the
dot
kids
domain,
which
is
a
safe
environment
in
which
there
are
sites
that
are
reviewed
that
are
intended
just
for
children.
that
dot
kids
domain
can
interact
with
the
filters
in
a
way
that
allows
a
parent
to
set
up
the
aol
account,
for
example,
so
that
their
younger
child
has
access
only
to
the
sites
in
the
dot
kids
domain.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
i
believe,
i
don't
have
that
statute
in
front
of
me,
but
i
believe
that
that...
that
the
idea
is
to
set
up
a
safe
environment
for
children
12
and
under,
that
that...
that's
the
way
that...
that
it's
defined
there.
and
then
finally,
of
course,
as
we
mentioned,
vigorous
enforcement
of
the
obscenity
law
could
solve
some
of
these
problems.
the
government
has
not
been
doing
that,
and
i
think
that
before--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--your
honor,
obscenity--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--obscenity
is
by
definition
speech
that
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
there--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--well,
and
i...
and
i,
of
course,
am
not
trying
to
say
that
those
prosecutions
wouldn't
ever
raise
a
first
amendment
issue.
of
course
they
would...
they
would.
but
this
statute
raises
a
first
amendment
question
in
every
single
application.
every
single
time
this
statute
is
applied,
it
violates
the
first
amendment
because
the
only
options
available
to
speakers
would
either
put
them
in
jail
for
making
their
speech
generally
available
to
the
public
or...
or
prevent
adults
from
accessing
that...
that
protected
speech
because
either
the
speaker
has
self-censored
or
they've
put
it
all
behind
a
screen
that
the
record
shows
drives...
drives
away
the
users,
and
i...
i
think
i
was
going
to
make
just
a
another
cite
to
the
record
that
i
think
is
an
important
one
to
note,
and
that
is
that
the
government's
own
expert
conceded
that
thousands
of
users
would
be
deterred
from
any
single
web
site
as
the
result
of
any
registration
system,
and
that
is,
again,
similar
to
the
evidence
that
the
court
relied
on
in
striking
down
the
statutes
regulating
indecency
in
cable
television
in
both
the
playboy
and
the
denver
area
cases.
this
statute
has
greater
problems
because
it's
a
criminal
statute.
those
statutes,
of
course,
just
involve
civil
penalties
that...
oh,
i
thought
i
had
that
cite
to
give
you
but
i
actually
don't...
i'll
try
to...
i'll
try
to
find
it
in
a
moment.
the...
the
district
court
in
its
findings
of
facts
specifically
noted
that
point
about
the
government's
expert
conceding
thousands
of...
of
users.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
yes,
and
they
don't
want
to
self-identify
because
they're
too
embarrassed
or
because
they
don't
want
to
be
stigmatized
by
being
associated
with
the
content.
there
is
an
additional
reason,
which
the
record
showed,
which
i
think
is
important
to
close
with,
and
that
is
the
nature
of
this
medium.
this
is
an...
a
wholly
unprecedented
medium
of
communication.
this
court
found
that
in
reno
v.
aclu.
it
has
extremely
low
barriers
to
entry.
it
allows
users
to
access
millions
of
sites
just
through
this
linking
process.
the
record
also
showed
that
by
setting
up
these
barriers
that
kind
of
destroyed
the
nature
of
accessing
information
on
the
internet.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
i...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
you,
justice
stevens.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
this
court
has...
has
never
upheld
any
statute
which--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--because
it's
so
clear
that
it
would
deter
adults
from
accessing
protected
speech.
i
think
that
that
is--
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
--oh,
let
me
then
cite
to
one
more
thing,
which
i
meant
to
get
to
before
and
i
didn't,
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
very
big
loophole
in
the
privacy
protection
in
the
law
and
that
is...
it's
under
(d),
let
me
quickly
find
it...
under
(d)(1),
there
was
an
exception...
(d)(2),
exceptions
to
the
privacy
protection,
any...
any
person
making
a
disclosure
is
not
covered,
i
mean,
can
make
the
disclosure
as
long
as
it's
necessary
to
conduct
a
legitimate
business
activity
related
to
making
the
communication.
that's
a
fairly
big
loophole
that
i
think
would
make
a
lot
of
users
very
nervous,
and
of
course,
the...
the
initial
problem
is
that
they
don't
want
to
give
their
credit
card
or
their...
or
their
id
even
to
the
web
site.
i
mean,
these
are
web
sites
that
they've
never
seen
before.
they're
surfing
the
web.
they're
not
trusted
local
stores,
they're...
they're
unknown
web
sites.
ms.
ann
e.
beeson
your
honor,
in
fact,
what
the
record
showed
in
this
case
was
that
the
only
time
that
internet
users
were
comfortable
giving
their
credit
card
was
when
they
were
ready
to
make
a
purchase.
this
law
applies
to...
as
general
olson
conceded,
to
just
making
the
speech
available
with...
surrounded
by
advertising.
anybody
who
did
that,
it
doesn't
just
apply
to
speakers
who
are
selling
their
speech
on
the
web.
in
closing,
i
just
want
to
say
again
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
government
can't
burn
down
the
house
to
roast
the
pig,
especially
with
so
many
other
tools
available
to
protect
minors
more
effectively
than
this
statute
does.
the
government
cannot
send
adults
to
jail
for
displaying
protected
speech
in
the
name
of
protecting
children.
thank
you.
