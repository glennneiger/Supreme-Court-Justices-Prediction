justice
kennedy
pardon
me.
that
virginia
is
a
sovereign?
justice
kennedy
virginia
rights
are...
virginia
rights
are
no
greater
than
any
private
landowner?
justice
kennedy
now,
one
of
my
questions
in
this
case
is
this.
you've
answered
justice
souter
and
he
posed
his
questions
this
way
based
on
article
vii
or
paragraph...
clause
vii
of...
of
the
compact.
but
must
we
not
interpret
that
too
according
to
the
black-jenkins
award,
particularly
paragraph
4
at
page
c-4
of...
of
the...
of
the
special
master's
appendices?
that
uses
the...
that
says
virginia...
not
citizens.
that
says
virginia
has
riparian
rights,
and
both
of
those
two
phrases
are
not
used
in
the
compact.
the
phrase,
riparian
rights,
i
don't
think
is
used
in
the
compact,
and
the
compact
talks
about
citizens.
but
the
black-jenkins
award
goes...
it
seems
to
me,
interprets
authoritatively...
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
what
the
compact
means.
and
i
read
the
black...
at
least
i
think
it's
a
permissible
reading...
to
say
that
virginia...
and
we'll
argue
about
as
a
sovereign.
that...
that's...
that's
a
phrase
i
add...
has
riparian
rights.
so
we
really
do
have
to
focus
not
just
on
section
vii,
but
on
part
4
of
the
black-jenkins
award,
do
we
not?
justice
kennedy
and...
and
in
the
exercise
of
that
authority,
could
maryland
give
a
higher
priority
to
the
citizens
of
rockville
than
to
the
citizens
of
vienna,
virginia?
justice
kennedy
no.
it's
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
they
make
a
lot
of
findings
and
they
said
there's
too
much
traffic
in
virginia.
virginia
would
be
better
off
if
it's
rural.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
and...
and
what
is...
what
is
the
source
for
your
statement
that
maryland
has
to
be
non-arbitrary?
is
this
riparian
water
law
or
is
this
some
constitutional
obligation
that
one
state
owes
to
another?
justice
kennedy
so
in
your
opinion--
--but...
but
that's
based
on...
on...
that's
a
statement
of
riparian
law?
justice
kennedy
so
we're
talking
about...
all
we're
talking
about
is
property
rights
here.
we're
just
talking
about
the
definition
of
what
a
riparian
right
is.
justice
kennedy
so
your
opinion
is--
--you...
you
used
the
word
arbitrary.
i
didn't.
i
just
want
to
know
the
source
of
law
which
governs
maryland's
obligation
under
your
point
of...
under
your
submission
to
make
these
determinations.
and
you
said
it
has
to
just
be
fair
among
riparian
owners
because
this
is
what
riparian
law
requires
it
to
do.
justice
kennedy
oh,
but
that's
just
an
obligation
it
has
as
to
all
of
its
citizens.
virginia
doesn't
have
any
special
standing
as
a
state.
justice
kennedy
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
implicit
assumption
at
least
of
both
the
1877
black-jenkins
award
and
the
1785
compact...
the
implicit,
if
not
explicit,
assumption
was
that
maryland
owned
the
river?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
i
thought
i
was
arguing...
making
your
argument
for
you.
so...
so
you...
but
then,
it
seems
to
me,
that
justifies
the
special
master's
approach.
you...
i
thought
you
were
saying,
oh,
now,
he
proceeded
on
the
wrong
premise.
this...
the...
the
boundary
line
was
settled.
all...
all
we're
talking
about
is...
is
the
rights...
or...
or
ownership
and
stuff.
but
you're
saying
no.
if
it's
everything
is
up
for
grabs,
then
the
1785
compact
and
the
black-jenkins
award,
what
do
we
look
to?
justice
kennedy
but
you
said
plain
language
of
the
compact,
and
now
you're
all
of
a
sudden
talking
about
black-jenkins.
justice
kennedy
the
compact
does
not
use
the
word
riparian.
justice
kennedy
so
you
say
it's
the
plain
language
of
the
compact
with
the
gloss
of
the
black-jenkins
award.
justice
kennedy
so
you...
you
say
that
in
interpreting
the
black-jenkins
award,
virginia's
riparian
ownership
is...
is
defined
by
its...
in
part
by
its
sovereign
status?
justice
kennedy
so
that
sovereignty
is
inherent
in
ownership?
justice
kennedy
except
for
the
sense
of
the
document,
at
least
of
the
compact,
as
i
read
it,
is
that
the
state
is
treated
just
like
any
other
owner.
justice
kennedy
well,
can
you
point
me
to
something--
justice
kennedy
--in
the
compacts
or
the...
or
the
black-jenkins
award
to
the
contrary?
justice
kennedy
and
that's
federal
common
law
because
two
states
are
involved?
justice
kennedy
is
that
what
the
special
master
specifically
held
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
but
if...
if
it
did
not,
i...
i
take
it
the
answer
would
be
in...
in
a
federal
question
suit
brought
by
maryland
against
the
virginia
citizen?
justice
kennedy
could
you
answer
this
question
for
me?
and
in
part,
i'm
going
back
on
the
ground
that
we've
been
traversing
already.
what
is
there
in...
in
the
documents
before
us...
by
that,
i
mean
the
compact
and
the
black-jenkins
agreement,
number
one,
or
in
the
law
generally,
number
two...
that
gives
virginia
special
rights
as
a
sovereign
to
withdraw
water
for
its
people
as
opposed
to
the
right
it
would
have
simply
as
an
owner
of...
of
property
to
withdrawal
rights
for
that
property
that
it
owns?
justice
kennedy
but...
but
those
are
cases...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
in
which
the
state
owns
out
to
the...
to
the
centerline
of
the
river.
justice
kennedy
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
kennedy
yes,
in
which
each
state
has
an
interest
in
the
river.
but
here--
justice
kennedy
--virginia
owns
only
to
the...
to
the
low-water
mark.
and
i
want
you
to
show...
tell
me
something
in
these
documents
which
says
that
virginia
has
a
special
right...
special
rights
as
a
sovereign--
justice
kennedy
--other
than
what
i
just...
other
than
we
know
that
virginia
is
a
party.
justice
kennedy
but
her...
but
does
her
riparian
ownership
give
it
any
rights
that
are
different
and
greater
than
a
private
owner
of
land?
justice
kennedy
and
what
is
the
source?
and...
and
what
is
your
support
for
that
proposition?
justice
kennedy
but
those
are
cases
in
which
the
states
have
an
ownership
interest...
an
equal
ownership
interest
in
the
river.
justice
kennedy
and
is
just
riparian
ownership.
justice
kennedy
i
think
at
the...
i
think
at
the
least,
would
you
concede
or
would
you...
that
the
black-jenkins
agreement
goes
a
step
beyond
the...
the
compact
in
this
regard?
justice
kennedy
but
you
are
depending
then
on
what
you
referred
to
as
federal
common
law
and
not
the
words
of
the
compact
and
not
the
words
of...
of
the...
the
black-jenkins.
justice
kennedy
in
the...
in
the
compact
beginning
with
article
or
clause
viii,
there's
some
very
particular
assignments
of
sovereign
powers,
abrogation
of
sovereign
power,
but
that
doesn't
apply
in
vii.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
helps
maryland
in
this
case.
when
the
compact
wanted
to
provide
virginia
would
have
very
specific
police
powers,
it
provided
it,
but
it
didn't
provide
that
with
respect
to
riparian
rights.
in
fact,
it
doesn't
even
mention
riparian
rights.
it
just
talks
about
wharfs.
justice
kennedy
referring
to
the
compact.
justice
kennedy
but
that...
it
doesn't
use
the
word
riparian.
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
so
sure.
if...
if
three
or
four
provisions
of
the
contract...
of
the
compact
have
very
specific
abrogations
or
assignment
of
sovereignty
and
the
other
one
doesn't,
i...
i
would
assume
that
there
is...
that
that
provision
has
not
been
made.
justice
kennedy
well,
other
than
he's
operating
from
the
baseline
where
maryland
owns
the
river.
justice
kennedy
well,
they
were
talking
about
virginia
when
it
has
a
right
regulate,
but
the
question
is
whether
they
were
talking
about
virginia
as
a
sovereign
when
it
withdraws
water.
justice
kennedy
and
i
think
that's
referring
to
sovereign
ownership.
