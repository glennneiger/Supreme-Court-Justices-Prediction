mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
here
held
that
the
bankruptcy
courts
are
required
to
presume
that
the
pre-bankruptcy
contract
rate
of
interest,
which
varies
from
creditor
to
creditor
and
could
range
anywhere
from
0
to
40
percent
or
more
in
some
jurisdictions,
is
the
appropriate
discount
rate
to
use
in
calculating
the
present
value
of
plan
payments
under
section
1325.
now,
that
approach
is
mistaken,
we
submit,
for
three
principal
reasons.
first,
it
violates
the
core
bankruptcy
principle
of
equality
of
distribution
for
similarly
situated
creditors.
under
the
court
of
appeals'
approach,
two
creditors
could
make
car
loans
to
the
same
debtor
that
resulted
in
allowed
secured
claims
of
equal
value,
and
yet
one
would
receive
thousands
more
in
plan
payments
solely
because
the
other
made
its
car
loan
at
a
time
when
the
debtor's
financial
troubles
had
not
yet
become
obvious.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
this
is
an
important
point
because
i
think
there
is
some
misconception
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that's
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
respondents,
at
least
as
i
read
their
position,
are
not
really
defending
the
approach
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
adopt
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
pre-bankruptcy
contract
rate
because
it
thought
that
that
represented
accurately
the
relevant
market,
if
you
will,
for
the
risks
of...
and
benefits
and
protections
that
exist
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
in
fact,
under
the
court
of
appeals'
approach,
the
risk
of
nonpayment
is
really
irrelevant.
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
is
that
because
the...
the
creditor
is
denied
use
of
funds
for
the
period
of
the
payment
plan,
that
it
therefore
is
entitled
to
whatever
rate
it
would
have
gone
out
and
funded
a
new
loan
at
if
it
had
been
allowed
to
foreclose
and
reinvest
the
proceeds.
now...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct,
and
i
just
want
to
emphasize,
though,
that...
that
the
adjustment
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
make
is
not
one
i
think
that
anybody
before
the
court
now
would
defend
because
the
court
of
appeals
would
adjust
only
if
you
could
prove
that
the...
a
particular
secured
creditor
is
now
making
loans
at
some
other
rate
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
why
that
has
anything
to
do
with
what
the
present
value
of
plan
payments
would
be
under
1325.
and...
and
the
problem...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
if
respondent's
view
is
that
you
should
have
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
pre-bankruptcy
contract
rate,
then
that
would
be
the
result.
what's
not
clear
to
me
is
whether
it's
actually
respondent's
view
that
you
should
have
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
subprime
contract
rate
or
the
highest
contract
rate
allowed
by
state
law
because
it's
important
to
remember
that
pre-bankruptcy
contract
rates
are
going
to
vary.
you
could
have
a
0
percent
lender.
you
could
have
a
prime
lender,
and
you
could
have
a
subprime
lender.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
any
one
of
those
necessarily
captures
the
unique
mix
of
risks
and
benefits
and
protections
that
exist
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
your
honor,
on...
i
would
refer
you
to
page
19...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
would
refer
you
to
page
19
of
the
government's
brief
where
we
refer
to
two
cases
by
this
court,
bigeur
v.
the
irs
and...
and
union
bank
v.
wolas,
that
stand
for
the
principle
that...
that
embody
the
notion
that
equality
of
distribution
among
creditors
is
a
central
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
that's
this
court's
language.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
similarly
situated
creditors.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
to
be
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
why
i
gave
the
example
that
i
did
of
two
creditors
that
extend
car
loans
and
the
only
difference
between
them...
they
have
the
exact
same
allowed
value
under
the
code
for
their
claim.
the
only
difference
between
them
is
that
one
made
its
loan
2
years
prior
to
bankruptcy
when
the...
when
the
debtor's
credit
history
was
not
quite
as
bad
and
the
other
made
it
2
weeks
before
bankruptcy
when
the
only
rate
the
debtor
could
get
is...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
because,
your
honor,
from
the
standpoint
of
section
1325(a)(5),
the
relevant
inquiry
is
what
is
the
present
value
of
the
promised
future
payments
from
the
debtor.
all
creditors
are
now
facing
the
exact
same
situation,
and
i
think
respondent
concedes
this.
and
those
are
the
risks
of
inflation,
the
time
value
of
money,
and
the
risk
that
particular
payments
may
not
be
made
under
a
plan.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
those
are
different
for
creditors...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
embodied
in
section
1325(a)(5).
if
anything,
that's
captured
in
the
higher
replacement
value
standard
for
the
valuing
of
the
underlying
claim
that
this
court
adopted
in
rash.
and
i
would
add
that...
that
one
reason
to
think
why
the
discount
rate
here
doesn't
need
to
go
too
far
in
taking
risks
of
nonpayment
into
account
is
that
this
court
in
rash
adopted
the
underlying
value
here,
replacement
value,
that's
typically
significantly
higher
than
what
the...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
your
honor,
what...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
my
only
point
is
that
this
court
in
rash
noted
that
the
higher
replacement...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
think...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
i...
i
generally
with...
with
your
honor's
statement.
what...
what
i
would
add,
though,
is
that
the
dispute
in
this
case
is
not...
i
mean,
it's
undisputed
that
inflation
and
the
time
value
of
money
have
to
be
taken
into
account
under...
under
the
discount
rate.
the
only
question
is
whether
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
risks
of
nonpayment.
we
submit
that
there...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
if...
if
this
court
believes
that
risks
of
nonpayment
need
to
be
taken
into
account,
then
we
submit
that
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
to
start
with
a
market
indicator
such
as
the
prime
rate
that
captures
the
time
value
of
money
and
the
risk
of
inflation
and
then...
then
allow...
and...
and
some
risk
of
nonpayment,
and
then
allow
the
bankruptcy
court,
which...
which,
by
the
way,
has
just
made
a
determination
under
1325(a)(6)
about
the
likelihood
that...
that
the
payments
will
be
made.
and
it
has
made...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
the
answer
to
your
question...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor...
your
honor,
the
answer
to
your
question...
[laughter]
the
answer
to
your
question
is
because
there
is
no
rate
you
can
find
that...
that
precisely
reflects
the
unique
mix
of
risks
and
benefits
and
protections
that
are
available
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
so
by
definition,
everyone
here
is
talking
about
a
proxy
in
some
form
or
another.
now,
what
the
prime
rate
does
do
is
is
it
accurately
captures
the
time
value
of
money
and
inflation.
now,
we
submit
that
the
bankruptcy
court,
which
has
just
examined
the
plan...
it
has
made
a
determination.
in
fact,
it
has
found
that
the
payments...
that
the
debtor
will
be
able
to
make
the
payments
under
the
plan...
that
bankruptcy
court
is
in
the
best
position
to
make
a
determination
about
plan-specific
risks
of
nonpayment
if
those
risks
are
going
to
be
included.
and
that's
a
much
more
efficient
system
than
forcing
the
bankruptcy
court
to
go
out
and
try
and
find
some...
some
elusive
market
that...
that
would
serve
as
a
proxy
for
that
determination.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
the
difficulty
with
the
contract
rate
approach
is
that
it
varies
from
creditor
to
creditor,
and
there
really
is
no
reason
to
think
that...
that
either
secured
creditors,
or
unsecured
creditors
for
that
matter,
for
purposes
of...
of
this
case,
should
be
treated
differently.
they
all
face
the
exact
same
risks
of
nonpayment,
the
exact
same
problems
of
inflation
and
time
value
of
money.
they
are
similarly
situated.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and...
and
another
secured
creditor
may
have
made
a
loan
prior
to
that
at
a
prime
rate
to
the
same
debtor,
and
it
always
charges
the
prime
rate,
neither
of
which
is
particularly
relevant
to
the
question
of
what's
the
value
of
the
promised
payments
under
the
plan.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
your
honor,
it's
not
a
matter
of
stupidity.
it's
a
matter
of
the
fact
that
a
debtor's
position
changes
over
time
and
that
what
may
be
a
good
rate
2
years
out
from
bankruptcy
and
that
is
still
owed
would
not
be
the
rate
you'd
give
immediately
before
bankruptcy.
and
it
may
not
be
the
relevant
risks
of
nonpayment
that
exist
under
bankruptcy.
the
point
is
that...
is
that
as...
as
this
court
understood
in
rash,
the...
the
creditor
is
entitled
to
the
value
of
its
allowed
secured
claim,
and
this
court
noted
in
rash
that
already
compensates
significant
risks
of
nonpayment.
now,
i
would
add,
if
i
may...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that...
that's
correct,
and
your
honor,
i
would
add
that
in
fact
we
think
it's
possible
to
read
the
statute
so
there's
no
risk
of
nonpayment
at
all
because
the
statute
refers
to
property
to
be
distributed
under
the
plan,
and
it
requires
the
bankruptcy
court
to
make
a
finding
that
the
debtor
will
be
able
to
make
payments.
and
there's
no
guidance
whatsoever
that
would
give
bankruptcy
courts
a
way
to
do
anything
more,
and
so
we
think
in
fact
that
an
appropriate
rate
could
even
be
the
treasury
bill
rate
which...
mr.
david
b.
salmons
excludes
that.
thank
you.
