mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
formula
approach
is
surely
inaccurate.
it
systematically
under-values
the
true
risks
and
costs
of
a
chapter
13
promise
of
repayment.
we
know
at
best
statistically
that
chapter
13
debtors
at
best
have
a
40
percent
rate
of...
of
payment
on
the
plans.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there...
there
is
one
study
that
suggests
that,
but
i
must...
i
must
add
that...
that
there
are
other
studies
that
say
that
the
successful
completion
rate
is
as
low
as
3
percent
in
some
jurisdictions.
some
97
percent
of
chapter
13
fail.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
those
are...
that's
a
total
number,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
giving
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt,
we...
the
best
we
can
say,
based
upon
what
we
know,
is
approximately
a
63
percent
success
rate.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it's
what
we
call
the
feasibility
standard,
your
honor,
and
it
applies
in
every
single
one
of
the
reorganization
chapters.
the
bankruptcy
court
must
merely
determine
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
feels
that
the
debtor
will
successfully
complete
the
plan.
we
know,
however,
that
given
the
extremely
high
rate
of
default
in
chapter
13,
which
far
exceeds
chapter
11,
for
example,
that
the
feasibility
standard
doesn't
even
come
close
to
ensuring...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
sources.
the
best
statistics
that
i've
been
able
to
come
up
with
is
that
it's
about
a
60
percent
failure
rate.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
60
percent
fail
within
the
3
to
5-year
period.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
statistics
are
not
disaggregated
on
that
basis,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
your
honor,
the
contract
rate
is
the
best
evidence,
the
single
best
evidence
of
the
market
rate.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
it
is
less...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
not
for
subprime...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
not
for
subprime
loans.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
this
is
why.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor,
and
this
is
why.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because
state
law
caps
the
maximum
rate
that
can
be
paid.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
so
it
increases
the
pool...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
of
who
can
be
lent
to,
but
not
the
rate.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because,
again,
the
contract
rate
is
the
best
evidence
of
a
market
rate
between
this
borrower
and
this
lender
with
this
particular...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
at
a
particular
time...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
particularly
if
it's
contemporaneous
to
the
filing.
it
reflects
it
and...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
contract
rate
is
not
perfect,
but
it's
far
superior
to
the
formula
approach,
and
what
you
see
happening...
justice
ginsburg,
the
second
circuit
in
the
valenti
case
came
up
with
a
3-point
factor,
just
simply
canvassing
some
lower
court
decisions
and
decided
prime
rate
plus
1,
2,
or
3
points.
it's
not
based
on
any
evidence.
it's
just
simply
based
upon
what
the
court
felt
was
an
appropriate
range.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
if
their
risks
are
different,
they
should
be
treated
differently,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
not
necessarily
so,
your
honor.
you
can
take
a
situation.
say
you
have
a
hotel,
a
common
asset
in
bankruptcy.
the
hotel
may
have
a
senior
secured
creditor
and
a
junior
secured
creditor.
the
number
one
secured
creditor's
risks
are
materially
less
than
the
junior
secured
creditor's.
they
would
be
separately
classified.
because
their
risks
are
different,
the
interest
rates
are
different.
in
this
very
case
at
page
12
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
can
see
how
the
debtor
broke
down
its
four
secured
creditors
into
four
separate
categories,
and
they
have
different
rates.
two
secured
creditors
are
offered
9.5
percent
and
two
are
offered
0
percent
interest
for
the
payments
the
debtor
is
going
to
make.
the
concept
of
equality
of
distribution
is
precisely
equality
of
distribution
among
similarly
situated
creditors.
secured
creditors
are
each
unique
by
their
own
definition
of
the
risks
that
they
take.
they
have
collateral.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that,
plus
the
fact
that
the
21
percent
is
often
going
to
be
actually
too
low
to
reflect
the
actual
risk
being
assumed.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
seems
to
be.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
so...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
formula
rate
is
essentially
standardless,
and
what
we
have
seen
how
bankruptcy
courts
apply
the...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
imperfect.
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
in
theory,
your
honor,
yes,
but
we
must
be
faithful
to
is
the
statutory
command.
and
here
what
we
see
happening
is
what
happens
in
this
case.
a
bankruptcy
judge
takes
the
formula
approach,
a...
basically
a
low
rate,
the
prime
rate,
and
is
supposed
to
adjust
it.
and
what
do
they
do?
well,
there's
no
evidence
to
support
any
adjustment
in
this
particular
case.
the
debtors'
expert
did
not
testify
that
he
knew
anything
about
the
risks
of
these
particular
debtors.
there's
no
basis
for
the
adjustment.
the
bankruptcy
court
did
what
bankruptcy
courts
do
in
these
cases;
it
simply
picked
a
number.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
creditor
did
bring
in
two
witnesses,
and
the
witnesses
testified
that
these
particular
debtors
with
their
particular
credit
histories
would
be
charged
a
21
percent
rate
of
interest.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
what
we
have
is
we
have
three
circuits
which
have
adopted
the
formula
approach,
and
so
we
have
the
experience
of
the
courts
in
those
circuits,
and
we
have
the
balance
of
the
circuits,
approximately
seven,
that
have
taken
more
of
the
market
rate
approach.
and
what
we
see
happening
is
that
in
those
situations
where
the
bankruptcy
courts
are
applying
the
formula
approach,
they
are
systematically
giving
chapter
13
debtors
a
rate
of
interest
pretty
close
to
prime.
now,
that
can't
be
correct.
that
gives
the
debtors
with
the
single
highest
default
rate
in
bankruptcy
the
lowest
rates
available
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
apparently
incorrectly
systematically
in
chapter
13
cases.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
and
here's
why.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because
the
true
market
rate
of
interest
is
almost
always
going
to
be
at
least
the
contract
rate,
presumptive
contract
rate,
because
the
costs
in
chapter
13
are
so
much
more
extraordinarily
higher
than
the
costs
of
collection
outside
of
chapter
13.
the
automatic
stay
stays
in
place
for
the
duration
of
the
plan.
if
you
have
a
default,
the
secured
party
has
to
come
back
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
hire
an
attorney,
pay
a
$75
filing
fee,
argue
the
case.
bankruptcy
judges
routinely
give
the
debtor
a
second
chance
to
cure
the
default.
they
have
to
come
back.
the
costs
of
collection...
that's
even
before
you
get
to
foreclose
on
your
collateral.
the
costs
of...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
your
honor,
the
secured
creditor
in
the
chapter
13
cramdown
context
is
not
trying
to
make
any
profit.
it's
simply
trying
to
mitigate
against
the
enormous
losses
that
it
suffers.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
taking
the
extremely
high
risks
of
default
and
the
costs
of
actually
having
to
foreclose
in
the
chapter
13
context,
the
relevant
market
rate
for
the
value
of
the
stream
of
payments
is
always
going
to
be
at
least
the...
the
pre-bankruptcy
contract
rate.
in
fact,
it
should...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
bankruptcy
statutes
sometimes
are
obscure
until
we
see
where
they
come
from,
which
is
why
we
often
look
at
their
history.
the
master
concept
of
cramdown
is
indubitable
equivalence.
it
comes
from
judge
hand's
opinion
in
the
murel
holdings
case.
and
the
example
in
1325(a)(5)(b)
that
we're
talking
about
is
simply
an
example
of
indubitable
equivalence.
the
secured
party
must
be
fully
compensated
for
the
risk
that
it
must
assume.
the
concept
of
indubitable
equivalence
must
be
completely
compensatory.
the
secured
party
is
not
supposed
to
take
uncompensated
risk.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
as
a
presumptive
rate,
your
honor.
and
it's
important
to
understand
just
after
this
court's
decision
in
rash
set
the
valuation
standard
for
setting
the
principal
amount,
what
you
see
now
is
that
since
we
got
the
standard
right,
in
99
percent
of
the
cases,
the
parties
come
to
an
agreement
as
to
what
the
value
of
the
collateral
is.
once
we
get
the
standard
right
here,
you
should
expect
the
same
thing.
it
won't
be
litigated
over
and
over
again.
the
correct
standard
is
i
think
to
recognize,
which
i
think
your
honor
does,
that
this
concept
of
present
value
is
an
economic
concept,
not
an
equitable
one,
and
that
essentially
what
we're
doing
is
we're
saying
there
is
a
stream
of
payments
to
be
made
here
and
we
have
to
figure
out
what
it's
worth.
the
best
test
for
what
it's
worth
would
be
what
the
market
says.
now,
the
problem
is,
is
that
in
chapter
11
there
is
a
market.
people
do
lend
to
chapter
11
debtors,
and
the
standard
is
the
same
in
chapter
11
as
13:
value
as
of
the
effective
date
of
the
plan
under
1129
so
what
we...
we
have
to
be
very
careful
about
is
in
chapter
11,
the
markets
do
value
debtors'
promises
to
pay
and
they
lend
money
and
they
charge
very
high
interest
rates.
exit
lenders
or
finance
lenders
charge
very
high
interest
rates,
18,
19,
20
percent.
it
can't
be
true
that
in
bankruptcy,
in
chapter
13,
where
the
riskiest
chapter...
riskiest
debtors
with
the
highest
default
rate,
that
we
systematically
give
them
a
rate
which
approaches
prime.
so
i
think
what
you
need
to
do,
recognizing
it's
an
economic
concept,
is
say
what's
the
best
evidence
of
a
market
rate.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
what
happens
the
second
time,
your
honor,
is
if
the
debtor
defaults
under
the
plan,
the
automatic
stay
is
still
in
effect.
unlike
chapter
11
cases,
where
the
automatic
stay
terminates
when
the
plan
is
confirmed
or
becomes
effective,
here
the
automatic
stay
stays
in
place
until
the
end
of
the
repayment
period.
so
if
the
debtor
defaults
under
the
plan,
someone
has
to
go
back
to
court
and
say,
i
need
relief.
i
need
relief
from
the
automatic
stay
to
exercise
my
collection
rights.
a
corporation
like
scs
can't
go
back
to
court
pro
se.
it
needs
a
lawyer.
you
have
to
hire
somebody
to
go
and
represent
them.
you
have
to
pay
a
filing
fee.
oftentimes
the
bankruptcy
judge
gives
the
debtor
a
second
chance
to
cure
the
default
under
the
plan.
then
the
debtor
says
i'll
cure,
and
then
you
come
back
a
second
time,
sometimes
a
third
time,
sometimes
a
fourth
time,
sometimes
a
fifth
time,
incurring
costs
at
each
juncture.
on
loans
that
typically
range
between
$5
to
$15,000,
having
to
go
to
court
even
once...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
covers
the
depreciation
problem.
as
we
have
delay
and
not
payment,
we
have
a
rapidly
depreciating
asset,
which
the
debtor
is
continuing
to
possess
and
drive
around.
this
interest
rate
compensate
for
the
risk
of
nonpayment
of
the
promises
to
pay
after
confirmation
and
the
costs
associated
with
the
debtor's
default
if
the
debtor
does
default
under
the
plan.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
but
at
the
time
the
loan
is
made,
your
honor,
we
don't
know
who
in
the
pool
of...
of
debtors
is
going
to
default.
once
the
default
happens...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
overall
the
risks
are
spread,
but
if
you
force
the
secured
party
to
systematically
subsidize
interest
rates
to
chapter
13
debtors,
who
have
now
demonstrated
by
their
filing
they
are
the
riskiest
of
the
risky,
what
you
will
eventually
have
happen
is
a
contraction
of
the
ability
to
lend.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
we
shouldn't
reward
those
who
file
bankruptcy
with
a
rate
that
is
less,
since
they
are
the
riskiest
of
the
risky,
than
we
would
charge
the
other
members
of
the
pool
who
avoid
bankruptcy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
but...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
johnson
case,
section
1325(a)(5)(b)
is
for
the
protection
of
creditors.
it
is
a
limit
on
the
debtor's
ability
to
adjust
or
restructure
the
creditor's
rights.
it
is
the
creditor's
protection.
the
debtor
has
options.
if
the
debtor
wants
to
surrender
the
collateral,
it
may
and
discharge
the
debt.
that
is
the
protection
for
the
debtor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
when
we
get
to
the
chapter
13
confirmation
stage,
we're
in
a
similar
position
as
when
we
are
at
the
beginning
of
making
loans
to
a
pool
of
applicants.
we
don't
know
who's
going
to
default
and
who
doesn't.
we
do
know
that
a
large
percentage
will.
we
do
know
that
the
best
evidence
of
a
market
rate
for
these
particular
class
of
borrowers
is
the
contract
rate.
and
the
question
then
becomes,
do
we
want
to
have
a
system
which
requires
us
in
each
bankruptcy
case
then
to
take
evidence
complicatedly
in
471,000
chapter
13
cases
as
to,
gee,
we
need
statistics
and
evidence
as
to
this
individualized
debtor?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
understand.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i'm
asking.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
understand,
your
honor,
and
i
wish
i
could
give
you
a
precise
formula.
the
problem
is
that
these
things
are
normally
left
to
the
market
to
do.
congress
has
said...
congress
has
said
basically
use
an
economic
market
concept
here
in
a
context
in
which
the
default
rate
is
so
high
that
lenders
are
just
not
willing
to
lend
to
chapter
13
debtors.
again...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
i
think...
i
think
it
was
your
honor
who
also
mentioned
that...
that
our
standard
is
no
less
cumbersome
than
theirs.
we
think
it
is
superior
because
it
will
yield
the
correct
result
more
often.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
misspoke.
excuse
me.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no.
they
often
have
lawyers,
your
honor.
but
let
me
suggest
this.
if
the
court
were
to
set
the
rate
at
the
presumptive...
the
contract
as
the
presumptive
rate,
this
is
what
would
happen
and
this
is
what
has
happened
in
circuits
where
that
is
so.
the...
the
contract
rate
becomes
the
presumptive
rate,
and
in
most
cases
the
debtor
will
offer
that
in
its
plan...
in
his
or
her
plan
as
the
appropriate
rate.
if
the
debtor
doesn't
like
that,
we'll
offer
less
of
a
rate
and
then
what
happens
is
a
negotiation.
and
the
debtor
and
the
secured
party
get
together
and
they
negotiate
based
upon
the
debtor's
presentation
of
this
is
why
i
think
it
should
be
adjusted
off
of
that
because
my
circumstances
have
improved
or
there's
a
lot
of
equity
in
this
particular
collateral,
so
your
risks
are
less,
so
you're
more
protected.
and
those
various
reasons
can
then
be
given,
and
then
the
parties
can
negotiate.
if,
however,
you
set
a
standard
where
the
bankruptcy
court
is
just
simply
going
to
decide
based
upon
the
evidence
that
the
parties
put
in,
we're
not
going
to
adopt
the
formula
approach,
then
you'll
be
back
to
the
problem
where
we
are
before,
lots
of
litigation.
again,
because
the
contract
rate
is
the
best
evidence
of
a...
of
a
market
rate
between
these
parties,
it
should
be
the
presumptive
rate
and
we
should
work
from
that.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
not
quite,
your
honor.
i
think
actually
this
is
the
same
analysis
as
in
rash.
what
the
court
said
in
rash
that
the
parties
had
to
do
was
the
debtor
had
to
go
out...
the
debtor
already
has
the
truck...
had
the
truck
in
rash...
is
go
out
and
see
what
it
would
have
cost
the
debtor
to
replace
that
truck.
it
didn't
actually
do
it,
but
simply
say
what
would
it
have
cost.
the
same
principle
applies
here.
the
debtor
should
actually
go
out
and
see
what
would
someone
pay.
how
much
would
someone
charge
to
finance
this
debtor's
loan?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
that's
true.
in
this
case,
though,
that
also
applies.
what
would
happen
if
bankruptcy
had
not
intervened
is
the
secured
party
would
have
foreclosed,
repossessed
the
collateral,
and
avoided
all
the
costs.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
reason
why
you
have
replacement
value
is
because
the
debtor
is
going
to
keep
the...
the
collateral
and
prevents
the
secured
party
from
exercising
its
rights
and
forces
the
secured
party
to
incur
costs
that
it
otherwise
would
avoid.
now,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
value
requirement
and
the
indubitable
equivalent
concept
and
the
whole
cramdown
standard
is
to
make
sure
the
secured
party
doesn't...
isn't
shouldered
with
uncompensated
risk.
so
the
question
becomes
what's
best
method
of
compensating
the
secured
party
for
its
risk.
and
the
statute,
because
of
what
it
requires,
value
as
of
the
effective
date
of
the
plan
using
an
economic
concept,
says
we
basically
have
to
value
the
stream
of
payments.
nobody
really
is
willing
to
say
i
would
give
this
debtor
$4,000
or
take
this
debtor's
promise
of
payment
of
$4,000
at...
at
a
prime
rate
or
anything
close
to
a
prime
rate.
again,
the
contract
date
is
the
best
evidence
of
a
market
valuation
that
we
have.
and
so
that's
what
i
think
we
have
to
work
with...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
to
be
faithful
to
the
statute.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
in
the
circuits
where
that
already
is
the
standard,
that
the...
that
the
presumptive
rate
is
basically
the
rate
that
we
use.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
there...
there
is
no
information
to
say
it's
higher
default
rate.
and
certainly
the
fact
that
most
of
the
circuits
have
this
standard
has
not
stopped
chapter
13
from
being
filed.
they
keep...
every
year
the
number
goes
up.
so
we're
now
at
about
470,000
chapter
13
cases
a
year.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
because
the
debtor
makes...
the...
the
debtor
does
not
make
payments
directly
to
creditors
under
the
chapter
13
plan.
the
debtor
makes
payments
to
the
chapter
13
trustee
as
a
dispersing
agent,
and
the
chapter
13
trustee
then
distributes
the
money.
what
you're
doing
here
is
you're
reallocating
in
this
case
a
few
hundred
dollars
away
from
unsecured
creditors
toward
the
secured
creditor
because,
again,
the
statute
says
the
secured
creditor
is
not
required
to
take...
shoulder
uncompensated
risk
for
the
benefit
of
anybody
else.
that's...
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
here
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
correct
rate
for
auto
loans
is
evidenced
by...
i
think
best
evidenced
by
the
auto
loan
contract.
it
is
a
loan
between
this
lender
and
this
debtor,
decided
in
the
marketplace,
with
this
particular
collateral.
it
is
the
best
evidence
of
a
market
rate
that
we
have.
it's
not
perfect,
your
honor.
i
concede
that,
but
it
is
the
best
evidence.
