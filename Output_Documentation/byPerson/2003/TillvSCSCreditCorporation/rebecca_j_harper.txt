ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
deferred
payments
under
section
1325(a)(5)(b)(ii)
must
equal
the
present
value
of
the
collateral.
historically
present
value
has
been
an
objective
concept
equalling
the
real
interest
rate
and
inflation,
which
is
the
time
value
of
money.
the
seventh
circuit
has
redefined
this
concept
in
a
manner
that
seriously
disrupts
two
fundamental
principles
of
chapter
13,
that
being
the
equal
treatment
of
creditors
similarly
situated
and
the
debtor's
rehabilitation,
the
debtor's
access
to
chapter
13.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
under
chapter
13,
you're
simply
trying
to
value
the
money.
it's
not
particular
to
a
specific
creditor
because
you're
just
trying
to
equate
the
amount
of
money
over
time
to
a
particular
amount
of
the
allowed
secured
claim.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
that's...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
i...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
you're...
you're
talking
about
interest
in
the
open
market,
though,
which
is
not
what
we're
talking
about
here.
we're...
we're
talking
more
about...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
that...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
i
was
going
to
get
to
that,
but
in
certain
circumstances
an
additional
risk
factor
may
be
required,
but
it
is
our
position
that
there
are
many
other
statutory
elements
under...
provisions
under
chapter
13
that
cover
the
types
of
risks
that
would
normally
be
included
in
a
contract,
for
instance.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
because
you
need
to
limit
the
purpose
of
that
premium.
most
risk
elements
are
encompassed
within
other
sections
of
chapter
13
because
your
normal
risk
of
deterioration
of
the
collateral,
for
instance...
that's
adequate
protection.
so
you
don't
have
to
add
on
for
that.
you
don't
have...
the
risk
of
default
is
covered
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
wage
assignment
in
effect.
i'm
saying
that
in
certain
instances...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
no.
the
21
percent,
such
as
the
21
percent
that
was
in
this
record,
there
was
no
support
for
at
all.
the
creditor
did
not
show
any
basis
for...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
well...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
yes.
it's
the
wrong
approach
because
the
only
thing
that
the
creditor
is
entitled
to
protection
for
under
1325
is
the
value
of
the
collateral.
in
that
21
percent
contract
rate,
first
of
all,
on
the
record
in
this
case
the
expert
couldn't
even
say
what
it
consisted
of.
but
in
your
typical
contract
rate
of
interest,
you're
going
to
have
transaction
charges.
you're
going
to
have
the
risk
of
default,
which
has
already
occurred
here,
the
risk
of
bankruptcy
default,
for
instance.
that
risk
has
already
occurred
here.
the
creditor
has
already
been
compensated
for
that.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
in
many...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
in
many
respects,
it
is
safer
because
here
you're
talking
about
a
subprime
lender
who
did
enter
into
a
contract
where
it
assumed
a
great
amount
of
risk,
but
now
the
debtor's
debt
structure,
his
payment
obligations
have
been
modified
by
the
chapter
13.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
i
think
that...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
a
lender
may
charge
additional
interest
if...
under
state
law
if
the
lender
has
indication
that
the
debtor
may
go
through
bankruptcy,
but
normally
in
the
subprime
market,
that's
all
factored
in
because
most
subprime
candidates
are
candidates
for
possible
bankruptcy
in
the
future.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
well...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
that's
not
necessarily
true
when
you
talk...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
the
problem
is
most
of
the
statistics
focus
on
the
default
rate
just
from
the
filing,
the
number
of
filings.
they
don't
focus
on
the
default
rate
after
the
chapter
13
has
been
confirmed
because
there
are
many...
the
case
by
that
point
has
been
reviewed
by
the
court
and
it's
determined
to
have
been
feasible.
the
debtor
by
that
point
has
been
making
payments
for
a
substantial
period.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
there...
i
have
found
limited
statistics.
one
study
that
i
found
said
that
63
percent
of
the
chapter
13's
completed
successfully
after
they
reached
the
point
of
confirmation.
so
there
is
suggestion
that
after
the
point
of
confirmation,
the
success
rate
gets
much
higher,
which
only
makes
sense
because
a
lot
of
times...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
well...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
the
subprime
lender's
risk
in
the
open
market
is
not
good
either.
so...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
it's
five
times
higher
than
the
prime
market.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
that
totally
eliminates
the
fact
that
a
chapter
13
has
been
filed
and
that
there
are
certain
minimal
requirements
for
chapter
13
confirmation.
a...
and
the
problem
is
that
market
rate,
the
way
these
courts
have
defined
it...
has
come
to
mean
anything
and
everything.
we're
talking
about
two
different
market
rates
here.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
requires
the
creditor
to
be
compensated
for
all
of
those
items
that
were
included
in
the
pre-petition
contract.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
how
could
the...
how
could
you
possibly
contract
in
advance
for
the
present
value
of
this
particular
allowed
secured
claim,
$4,000?
that
amount
wasn't
even
known
when
the
contract
rate
was
established.
the
contract
rate
was
based
upon
particular
characteristics
of
the
creditor
and
the
debtor
and
many...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
that's...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
that's
not
the
question.
the
question
is
not
what
someone
would
make
a
new
loan
for
because
an
allowed
secured
claim
in
chapter
13
is
a
claim.
it's
not
a
loan.
once
the
bankruptcy
is
filed...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
that's
a
good
question.
i
believe
that
it
just
results
from
the
fact
that
in
your
typical
chapter
13,
you
don't
have
a
lot
of
special
risk
that
has
to
be
compensated
for
because
you
usually
have
the
fixed
asset,
there's
no
hazard...
hazardous
use,
you've
got
a
wage
assignment.
you...
substantial
risk
might
result,
for
instance,
in
a
chapter
13
if
you
had
a
balloon
payment.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
a
balloon
payment
instead
of
periodic
weekly
payments,
which
is
usually
what
you
have
in
a
chapter
13.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
that's...
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
that
1.5
in
that
case
was
actually
a
local
bankruptcy
rule.
but
that
same
expert
also
testified
that
prime
already
includes
2
percent
which
could
not
be
accounted
for
except
for
risk
and
transaction
fees.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
but,
again,
we're
not
talking
about
borrowing
on
a
new
loan
in
a
chapter
13.
the...
we're
talking
about
modification
to
an
old
loan,
an
existing
loan.
1322(b)(2)
allows
you
to
modify
that
contract.
so
we're
not
looking
at
what
this
debtor
would
have
to
pay
in
the
open
market
were
it
not
for
the
chapter
13.
that's
not
the
proper
inquiry.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
rebecca
j.
harper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
we
need
to
get
back
to
the
concept
of
present
value.
present
value
is
the
time
value
of
money,
which
is
the
real
rate
of
interest
plus
inflation.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
real
rate
of
interest
was
2-and-one-half
percent,
and
inflation
was
3-and-one-half
percent.
now,
in
this
case,
the
debtors
made
all
the
payments.
they
actually
paid
the
contract
off
early,
but
we
need
to
start
with
as
pure
a
base
as
possible
and
then
if
there
are
special
circumstances,
sure,
the
bankruptcy
court
could
have
discretion
to
add
on
if
there
is
particular
jeopardy
to
the
property.
but
we're
measuring
two
different
things
here.
the...
the
statute
doesn't
say
contract.
the
statute
doesn't
say
market
rate.
this
market
rate
concept
has
been
misabused.
and
it...
right
now
under
the
bankruptcy
court's
interpretation
anything
is
okay
as
long
as
you
put
this
market
rate
label
on
it,
and
that's
not
a
proper
standard
for
chapter
13
confirmation.
the
other
problem
is
with
the
respondent's
approach,
the
respondent
uses
words
out
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
pre-bankruptcy
act,
that
simply
were
never
enacted
under
chapter
13.
full
compensation,
full
value
of
their
rights.
that's
nowhere
in
chapter
13.
it's
not
a
part
of
the
chapter
13
requirements.
indubitable
equivalence.
that's
not
a
chapter
13
confirmation
concept.
that's
a...
that's
a
concept
that
was
brought
in
to
confuse
this
issue,
but
it
is
not
chapter
13.
respondents...
their
amicus
said
that
under
their
interpretation
of
the
statute,
basically
anything
goes.
a
rate
from
100
percent
to
300
percent
would
be
just
fine
with
them.
congress
has
not
chosen
to
protect
subprime
creditors.
this
goes
against...
