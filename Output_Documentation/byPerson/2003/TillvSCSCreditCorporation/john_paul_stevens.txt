justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
right?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the...
the
point.
i
thought
if
you
had
that
differential
before
the
bankruptcy
judge,
it's
a...
the
original
is
a
presumptive
risk,
and
the
judge
could
then
resolve
it
by
maybe
compromising
between
the
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that's
run
through
my
mind
listening
to
this
argument?
going
back
to
the
rash
case,
was
it,
that
we...
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
did
not
there...
the
majority
did
not
there.
i
was
in
dissent
in
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
not
take
the
case
to
try
and
replicate
what
would
have
happened
if
there
had
been
no
bankruptcy.
they
said,
we
won't...
won't
treat
it
as
a...
now,
you're
in
effect
asking
we
do
treat
the
case
as
close
as
possible
to
what
you
would
have
negotiated
in
a
free
market.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
doing
that,
they
were
saying,
we're
going
to
do
that
instead
of
trying
to
predict
what
would
happen
to...
in
the
normal
course
of
events
between
the
contracting
parties
if
bankruptcy
had
not
intervened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
at
replacement
value.
you
would
not
have
gotten
replacement
value.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
pretty
obvious
if
it's
a
higher
rate,
there
are
going
to
be
more
defaults.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
till
against
the
scs
credit
corporation
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
seventh
circuit,
it
is
a
chapter
13
bankruptcy
case.
in
what
is
known
as
the
cram
down
option,
a
plan
allowing
the
debtor
to
retain
possession
of
an
asset
securing
a
creditor’s
allowed
claim
can
be
approved
over
the
objection
of
the
creditor
if
the
plan
provides
that
the
creditor
will
receive
the
value
of
the
asset
as
of
the
date
of
the
plan.
normally
that
means
that
the
plan
will
provide
for
a
stream
of
installment
payments
that
add
up
to
the
value
of
the
asset
plus
interest.
the
question
in
this
case
is
how
bankruptcy
judges
should
set
the
interest
rate.
should
they
start
with
the
rate
that
the
debtor
agreed
to
pay
when
he
purchased
the
asset,
in
this
case
21%,
and
place
the
burden
on
the
debtor
of
proving
that
a
lower
rate
is
appropriate,
because
the
plan
cannot
be
approved
without
approval
of
the
judge
who
must
find
that
the
plan
is
feasible
and
will
likely
succeed?
or
should
they
start
with
the
prime
rate,
in
this
case
8%,
and
place
the
burden
on
the
creditor
of
establishing
how
great
an
operate
adjustment
should
be
made?
a
third
possibility
consistent
with
the
statutory
text
would
be
to
ignore
the
risk
of
default
entirely
and
just
use
the
prime
rate.
this
is
a
question
on
which
many
judges
have
disagreed
and
written
at
a
great
length.
we
have
done
so
as
well.
four
of
us,
justices
souter,
ginsburg,
breyer,
and
i,
have
concluded
that
we
should
presume
that
an
approved
plan
will
succeed.
justice
scalia
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
o’connor
and
kennedy,
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit
and
would
endorse
the
presumptive
contract
rate.
because
justice
thomas
analysis
is
closer
to
ours
than
to
the
dissenters,
he
joins
the
judgment
reversing
the
court
of
appeals.
