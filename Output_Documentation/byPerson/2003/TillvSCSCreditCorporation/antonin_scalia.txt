when
you
say
traditionally
it's
been
understood
to
mean
real
interest
rate
plus
time
value
of
money,
it
means
real
interest
rate
for
the
particular
lender.
isn't...
i
mean,
the...
the
interest
rate
that
is
given
to
different
lenders
is
not
always
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
right,
but
the
interest
rate
that
i
have
to
pay
when
i
buy
a
house
with
a
very
small
down
payment
is
much
higher
than
the
interest
i
have
to
pay
if
i
make
a
much
larger
down
payment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
interest
i
have
to
pay,
if
i
make,
you
know,
over
$200,000
a
year
is
less
than
i
would
get
if
i
have
a
lower
income.
so
you
can't
just
speak
of
a
fair
interest
rate
in
the
abstract
as
though
it's
a...
it...
it's
a
platonic
number
floating
out
there.
it
certainly
depends
upon
the
solvency
and...
and
the
record
of
payment
of
the
person
paying
the
interest.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
surprised
to
hear
you
saying
this
because
i
thought
your
brief
acknowledged
that
even
after
you
begin
with
the...
with
a
discount
rate,
you
know,
the...
the
fed's
discount
rate...
i
thought
your
briefs
acknowledged
that
the
bankruptcy
court
could
add
to
that
a...
a
surcharge
depending
upon
the
riskiness
of
the
chapter
13
debtor.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't
acknowledge
that?
i
thought
your
brief
acknowledged
that.
i'm...
you...
you
really
want
to
use
the
discount
rate,
period,
and
nothing...
nothing
tagged
on
top
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that
makes
this
a
better...
a
better
borrower?
it...
it
makes
it
a
safer
loan
when
you're...
when
you're...
you're
owed
money
by
somebody
who
has
already
been
through
bankruptcy
once?
you
think
you're
in
better
shape?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
that's...
that's
a
novel
approach.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
still
not
a
very
good
risk.
i
mean,
you...
justice
antonin
scalia
you
lend
money
to
somebody.
your
chances
of
getting
it
back
are
2
out
of
3?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it's
better
than
2
out
of
3.
justice
antonin
scalia
let...
let
me
ask
you
a...
the...
the
way
i
see
these
two
approaches.
i'm
assuming
that...
that
you're...
you're
willing
to
allow
over
the
prime
rate
some
addition
which
the...
the
courts
that...
that
follow
your...
your
favored
approach
do
allow
for
risk
factor.
so
under
your
theory,
you
take
the
prime
rate,
and
then
it
is
up
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
assess
what
the
risk
is,
something
that
i
think
judges
are
probably
not
very
well
qualified
to
do.
you
know
when...
when
you
pick
the
prime
rate,
that
that's
not
the
market
rate.
it
obviously
isn't.
so
it's
well
below
the
market
rate.
i
mean,
here
you
had
a
21
percent
loan
and
you're
going
to
take
what?
justice
scalia
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
prime
rate
of
8
percent
at
most?
you
know
it's
wrong.
and
then
the
bankruptcy
judge
has
to
make
it
right.
okay?
under
the
other
approach,
you
take
the
market
rate,
the
rate
that
was
actually
adopted
between
these...
these
two
people
operating
in
a
free
market.
now,
it...
it
may
be...
may
be
high,
it
may
be
low.
you
don't
know
for
sure
that
it's
either
one.
it's...
it's...
it
may
be
accurate.
it
is
not
surely
inaccurate
the
way
picking
the
prime
is.
and
then
the
adjustment
to
be
made
by
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
much
less.
if
there
are
some
special
factors
that
show
a
lesser
risk
now
than
there
was
when
the
loan
was
originally
made,
he
might
take
them
into
account.
now,
as
i
see
it,
the
less
discretion
that
is
left
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
and
the
more
weight
that
is
given
to
the...
to
the
real
forces
of
the
operating
market,
the
better
off
we
are.
i...
i
don't
think
that
bankruptcy
judges
are
very
good
risk
calculators.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
using
the
rate
of
the
loan
that
was
actually
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
he
has
to
be
given
the
current
value
of
his
security
and
the
current
value
of
his
security,
which
is
not
going
to
be
received
20
years
from
now
or
5
years
from
now,
depends
upon
how
much
of
a
credit
risk
there
is
that
that
money
will
actually
be
paid.
justice
antonin
scalia
in...
in
an
open
market.
and
if
the
debtor
could
have
gotten...
it's
a
very
competitive
market,
as
i
understand
it.
and
if
the
debtor
could
have
gotten
a
lower
rate
elsewhere,
he
presumably
would
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just
saying
that
that's...
that
that's
a
reasonable
starting
point.
now,
if
there
has
to
be
an
adjustment
because
market
rates
have
gone
down
since
then,
that
minor
adjustment
can
be
made,
but
that's
going
to
be
much
less
of
an
adjustment
than
you're
going
to
have
to
leave
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
if
you
begin
with
the
prime
rate
which
you
know
is
wrong.
you
know
that
nobody
would
have
made
this...
this
car
loan
at
the
prime
rate.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
it,
your
expert
in
this
case,
your
economist,
testified
that
the
prime
rate
was
8
percent
and
that
in
his
view
a
reasonable
risk
premium
would
be
1.5.
but
he
conceded
under
cross-examination
that
he
was
unfamiliar
with
the
relevant
rates
of
default
or
costs
of
servicing
loans
in
the
subprime
market,
which...
justice
antonin
scalia
to
my
mind
is
conceding
that
he
has
no
basis
for
picking
1.5
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
risk...
the
risk
of
a
prime
borrower,
of
a
fat
cat
borrower.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you,
and...
and
the
respondent
is
not
defending
that
approach,
but
rather
the
approach
that
you
use
the
rate
of
the...
of
the
original
loan
as
the
starting
point,
and
then
adjust
it
as
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
you
get
the
principle
that
all
secured
creditors
have
to
be
treated
equally?
where
does...
where
does
that
appear?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
it's
true
of
all
unsecured
creditors.
i...
i
don't
know
why...
justice
antonin
scalia
start
with
a
figure
that
you
know
for
sure
is
wrong.
you
know
for
sure
that
this
person
who
got
a
21
percent
car
loan
because
he
was
a
bad
credit
risk
was
never
going
to
get
the
prime
rate
of
8
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
begin
with...
with
something...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
you
know
is
going
to
be
abysmally
low
except
for
the
fact
that
it
will
mean
less
money
for
the
secured
creditors
and
more
money
for
the
unsecured
creditors,
among
whom
is
often
numbered
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
this
lender
always
charged
21
percent.
it
didn't
differ
from...
from
lender...
borrower
to
borrower.
every
one
of
them
was
charged
21
percent.
that
was
the
market.
justice
scalia
after
confirmation.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that's
the
difference
between
your
statistics...
yes.
and
hers.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
21
percent
may
not
be
precisely
what
the
rate
is
today
for
a
loan
made
3
years
ago,
but
it's
going
to
be
a
lot
closer
to
it
than
8
percent
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
yours
is
in
theory
perfect.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
yours
is
in
theory
perfect
just
as...
as
the
formula
is
in
theory
perfect.
in
both
of
them
you...
you
begin
with
a
starting
point,
and
then
you
make
whatever
adjustments
the
reality
of
the
risk
requires.
that
brings
you
theoretically
in
both
cases
the
perfect
answer.
the
only
question
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
which
of
the
two
is
likely
to
come
closer
to
the
correct
answer,
starting
with
8
percent
that
you
know
is
way
off
the
mark
and
then
letting
the
bankruptcy
judge
figure
out
how
much
you
add
to
that,
or
starting
with
21
percent
which,
you
know,
is...
is...
it
could
be
high,
it
could
be
low.
it's
much
fairer
to
both
parties,
but
then
let
the
bankruptcy
judge
adjust
that
a
little
bit.
that's
the
question:
what...
what
the
practical
consequence
is
not
the...
the
theoretical
they're
both
perfect
theoretically.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brunstad...
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
suggest
a
scary
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it...
is
it
possible
that
the
statute
does
not
provide
an
answer
to
this
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
since
both
of
these
schemes,
your
proposal
and
the
other
side's
proposal,
are
theoretically
perfect,
if
they
are
done
correctly,
the
bankruptcy
court
is
free
to
use
either
one
so
long
as
he
comes
up
with
the
right
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
only
thing
the
statute
says
is
what...
what
justice
breyer
keeps
coming
back
to.
you
have
to
provide
him
$4,000
in
value.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
more
cumbersome.
surely,
you
mean
it's
no
more
cumbersome
than
theirs.
