it
showed
what
the
creditor
had
been
getting
before,
and
that,
i
thought,
was
the
argument,
that
in...
out
of
chapter
17...
13,
in
chapter
13
our
contract
rate
was
21
percent,
and
that
represents
what
it
would
cost
this
borrower
if
he
were
today
to
take
those
funds,
get
the
same
funds.
it
would
cost
him
21
percent
because
he's
a
high-risk
borrower.
that's...
that's
the
theory.
but
you're
saying
that
that
is
a
wrong
theory,
as
judge
rovner
said
in
her
opinion,
but
it's...
it's
not
because
it's
more
difficult
to
apply
than
some
other
theory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you're...
you're
saying
that
that's
a
wrong
approach,
and
maybe
you'll
say
why.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
ask
you
this...
this
piece
of
it.
the...
justice
scalia
said
to
give
this
kind
of
you-pick-it
discretion
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
a
worrisome
thing,
but
all
of
the
cases
that
take
this
approach,
the
treasury
bill
approach
or
the
prime,
seem
to
have
a
rather
narrow
range
for
that
risk
factor.
they
go
from
1
percent
to
3
percent,
and
none
of
them
go
over
3
percent.
where
did
they...
where
did
that
range...
who
invented
that
range
that
3
percent
would
be
the
ceiling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
what
payment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
if
this
had
been
foreclosure
value,
then
if
we
were
going
through
this
exercise,
well,
the
creditor
would...
would
then
sell
the
asset
and...
and
charge
a...
a
new
borrower
with
the
same
rate
of
interest.
but
the
asset
would
be
worth
much
less
than
the
price...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your...
if
you
take
mr.
salmons'
point
that
now
we're
in
bankruptcy,
it's
a
different
world,
and
we've
got
one
creditor...
let's
say
$4,000
is
the
principal
for
both,
but
one
lent
at
prime
and
one
lent
at
subprime.
once
we're
in
the
universe
of
bankruptcy,
why
shouldn't
those
two
lenders,
both
with
$4,000
principals,
be
treated
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
once
you're
in
the
bankruptcy,
the
risk
of
getting
back
the
$4,000
is
the
same
for
both
creditors,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
don't
you
get
certain
advantages?
i
mean,
you
do
have
the
wage
order.
so
there's
a
court
supervising
that
this
wage...
every
month
that
this
person,
this
borrower,
is
going
to
have
to
pay.
and
in
the...
in...
in
that
setting
you
also
have...
going
back
to
rash,
the
one
thing
i
don't
understand
about
it
because
it
seems
you
want
to
take
it
the
high
side
both
ways.
you've
already
been
given
the
replacement
value
rather
than
the
foreclosure
value.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
we're
going
to
do
it
your
way
and
say,
well,
now,
suppose
the
lender
foreclosed
on
the
asset,
made
a
new
loan
at
the
21
percent
rate...
but
you
would
have
to
use
not
the
replacement
value,
the
higher
value.
you
could
only
use
what
you
could
get
on
foreclosure
if
we
follow
your
theory
about
we
should
make
it
just
like
you
sold
the
asset,
got
money,
and
made
a
new
loan.
but
the...
but
you...
but
the
amount
that
you
got
would
be
much
less
than
the
replacement
value
which
is
what
you're
getting
inside
the
bankruptcy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
one
of
the
adjustments
that
would
have
to
be
made?
you
couldn't
say
adjust
20
percent
against
$4,000.
you'd
have
to
say
$4,000
minus
because
your
foreclosure
price
is
going
to
be
much
lower
than
the
replacement
costs
that
you've
got
in
the
bankruptcy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr....
mr....
it
is
to
this
extent.
most
of
these
debtors
are
very
small
debtors.
you
say
take
the
contract
rate
as
the
presumptive
rate
and
then
we're
going
to
knock
down
for
all
these
other
things.
the
high
replacement
cost
that...
is
one
thing.
the
interest
that
they
got
before
bankruptcy
is
another.
the
transaction
cost
that
they're
saved,
another.
and
so
let
the
debtor
come
in
and
show
that.
but
the
debtor
has
no
money
at
all
and
certainly
you
don't
want
the
debtor's
money
eaten
up
hiring
an
attorney
and
further
depleting
the
money
that
could
go
to
the
creditors.
so
it
seems
to
me
wildly
unrealistic
to
expect
that
if
you
say
the
presumptive
price
is
the
contract
price,
you're
going
to
get
a
debtor
who
will
be
able
to...
i
mean,
i
was
surprised,
looking
at
this
record,
that
this
debtor
got
an
expert.
who...
who
paid
the
expert?
maybe
because
the
union
was
involved?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
typical
that
these
chapter
13
debtors
don't
have
lawyers
and
don't
have
experts?
