justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
think
the
same
thing
that's
bothering
justice
scalia,
or
that
prompted
his
question
in
any
event,
is...
is
troubling
me.
when
i...
i
read
the
briefs,
i...
i
thought
that
the
coerced
loan
approach,
which
you
object
to,
did
have
certain
deficiencies,
because
you
had
to
have
testimony
what
the
interest
rate
is,
you
have
to
conform
it
to
the
particular
transaction,
it's
hard
to
administer.
i
frankly
don't
see
how
yours
is
much
different
because
you
add
a
premium
to
the
prime
rate.
what
is
that
premium
going
to
be?
why
shouldn't
it
depend
on
the
transaction?
why
shouldn't
it
depend
on
the
risk
of
default?
why
doesn't
your
approach
have
all
of
the
same
problems
as
the
coerced
loan
approach?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
that
was
true,
you
could
bring
up
the
same
thing
when
you're
cross-examining
the
expert
on
the
coerced
loan
approach
and
say,
well,
we
don't
want
21
percent
because
there's
a
wage
assignment.
it's
the
same
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
a
lender
has
two
different
loan
candidates
in
front
of
him,
one
he
thinks
is
going
to
go
through
bankruptcy
and
the
other
he
thinks
is
not,
so
he's
going
to
give
the
loan
to
the
first
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
that's
very
difficult
for
me
to
assume.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
but
you're
saying...
but
you're
saying
that
under
the
respondent's
view,
that...
that
the
creditors
would
be
treated
differently?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
you
tell
me
why
is
it
that
the
petitioners
tell
us
that
their
standard
is
so
much
easier
to
administer?
is
it
because
the
courts
aren't
administering
it
in
the
right
way?
as
i
listened
to
it,
it
seems
to
me
i
have
two
choices.
i
can
begin
with
a
low
rate
and
add
or
i
can
begin
with
a
high
rate
and...
and
subtract.
why...
why
is
one
any
more
easy
to
administer
than...
than
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
fact,
it...
it
would
seem
to
me...
and
this
i
suppose
helps
you...
that
if
the
courts
which
are
using
the
petitioners'
formula
are
doing
it
the
right
way,
it
might
even
be
harder
to
administer.
they...
they
avoid
that
problem
by
just
accepting
some
interest
factor
of
1
to
3
percent
out
of
the
blue
although
i
don't
know
how
they
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
don't
think
it's
certainly
conclusive
of
the
point,
but
the
initial
21
percent
rate,
i
take
it,
did
take
into
account
the
risk
of
default.
so
in
a
sense,
the
creditor
has
received
up
front
some
compensation
for
the
risk
that
in
fact
has
occurred.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
overall,
you
account
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
bankruptcy
code,
i
take
it,
has
solicitude
for
debtors.
isn't
that
one
of
its
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
does
that
just
drop
out
when
we
come
to
the
cramdown
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
i...
i
thought
difficulty
of
administration
charge
was
the
one
that
the
petitioners
were
making
against
you.
how...
how
do
i
sort
that
out?
