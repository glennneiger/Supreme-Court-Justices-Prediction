justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
has
that
to
do
with
it?
i
don't
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
the
reason
i
say
that
is
i
thought
we
were
following
a
statute,
and
what
the
statute
tells
us
is
that
the
value
of
what
they
receive
has
to
equal
$4,000.
they
receive
a
set
of
promises
to
pay
so
much
a
month
and
the
right
to
repossess
if
those
promises
are
not
kept.
now,
that's
what
the
statute
tells
us
to
do.
so
let's
do
it.
what
do
we
care
how
they
arrived
at
the
$4,000?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whatever
it
said
in
rash,
reading
the
statute,
unless
they
actually
contradicted
that,
doesn't
the
statute
say
what
i
just
said?
so
the
problem
in
the
case
is
how
do
we
value
the
stream
of
payments
plus
the
repossession
value?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
have
thought
that
that
kind
of
thing
is
something
bankruptcy
judges
are
paid
to
make
judgments
about
all
the
time.
justice
breyer
of
course,
you
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
you
do.
there
is
a
risk
of
nonpayment
and
anything
that
didn't
take
that
into
account
would
not
be
equating
the
property
with
the
$4,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how
many
default?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
do
we
know
how...
how
many...
what's
the
percentage
of
people
in
this
chapter
that
default
within
a
year
on...
on
a
payment
of
about
$128
a
month
i
guess,
that
was
a
small
percentage
of
what
they
were
paying
into
the
court?
what's
the
figure?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
60
percent
fail
within
a
year?
you
said
that
40
percent
failed
overall.
justice
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
asked
you
how
many...
this
is...
or
let's
take
it
then
giving
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
the
payment
plan
was
for
17
months.
what
is
the
percentage
of
people
who
fail
to
make
a...
i
guess
it
was
about
10
percent
or
20
percent
of
the
amount
he
was
paying
into
court.
how
many
fail
to
make
that
kind
of
payment
within
17
months?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
that's
what
i
would
think.
so
what
is
wrong
with
us
saying
just
by
chance
what
the
statute
says?
what
the
statute
says
is,
bankruptcy
judge,
here's
what
you
do.
you
create
a
stream
of
payments
such
that
that
stream
of
payments
plus
the
value
of
the
repossession
equals
$4,000.
now,
that's
your
job.
go
do
it.
so
i
would
have
thought,
if
i
were
the
bankruptcy
judge,
the
way
i'd
do
it
would
be
by
looking
to
the
prime
rate
and
then
asking
me...
asking
you
or
others
to
tell
me
how
much
riskier
this
is
than
the
prime
rate,
and
i'd
choose
a
number.
and
i
can't
imagine
how
we're
going
to
come
one
whit
closer
than
that
general
instruction,
but
you'll
tell
me
why
it
is
possible
to
come
closer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
contract
rate...
if
there
has
to
be
a
number
that's
wrong,
it
has
to
be
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
contract
rate
by
definition
was
entered
into
at
some
significant
period
of
time
prior
to
the
present,
and
the
present,
by
chance
in
this
instance,
is
2
years
later,
and
we
know
that
interest
rates
fell
at
least
1
or
2
percent
during
that
time.
justice
breyer
so...
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
impossible.
the
prime
rate...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
then
the
risk
went
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
okay.
okay.
justice
breyer
all
right.
justice
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
because
it's
a
usury
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
you
would
be
free
with
your
experts
to
come
in
and
say
why
it
happens
to
be
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
wrong
to
take
the
prime
rate
and
add
a
risk
factor,
but
ordinarily
a
contract
entered
into
in
advance
would
not
be
good
evidence
of
what
the
interest
rate
is
today.
now,
where
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
a
prior
time.
justice
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
yes,
of
course.
i'm...
but
i'm...
i'm
simply
saying
isn't
it
true
by
definition
that
a
contract
entered
into
at
an
earlier
period
of
time
where
interest
rates
fluctuate
is
not
going
to
be
very
good
interest...
evidence
of
what
that
interest
rate
is
today.
justice
breyer
well,
that
may
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
may
be,
but
what
i
didn't
understand
about
your
answer
is
when
you
said
that
the
contract
rate
must
be
more
accurate
than
the
formula.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
the
formula
by
definition
is
perfect...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
the
formula
is
an
instruction
to
equate
the
value
of
the
stream
of
payments
plus
repossession
with
$4,000,
the
formula
by
definition
is
perfect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
i
take...
you're
saying
that...
justice
breyer
wait.
justice
breyer
answer...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
satisfy
you
if
we
said
this?
suppose
we
said
we
see
what
we're
after
here.
the
objective
is
to
equate
the
stream
of
payments
plus
repossession
with
$4,000.
now,
on
the
one
hand,
we
know
it
can't
be
lower
than
the
prime.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
creditor
wants
to
come
in
and
give
a...
present
his
evidence,
the
contract,
of
how
risky
this
person
is,
then
in
fact
it
is
evidence
absolutely.
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
will
look
at
it,
and
he'll
try
to
figure
out
the
pluses
and
the
minuses,
what's
happened
to
the
interest
rate,
whether
this
particular
person
is
a
good
or
bad
risk,
and
he'll
choose
a
number.
don't
judges
do
things
like
that
all
the
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
no.
but
does
what
i
say
satisfy
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
not...
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nobody
is
disagreeing
with
you
about
that.
that...
what
we're...
i
think
what
we're
trying
to
get
to...
it's
a
practical
question.
i
actually
think
my
approach
is
more
perfect
than
justice
scalia's
perfect
approach.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
reason
is
it
asks
the
right
question.
now,
what
you're
telling
me
is
that
by
asking
the
right
question,
the
bankruptcy
judges
systematically
have
not
done
it
right.
and...
and
i
see
your
point.
so...
so
what
we're...
so
we're
trying
to
think
of
a
form
of
words
we
could
say
which
would
lead...
i
can't
say
take
the
contract
rate
because
i
know
that
must
be
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
could
say
take
the
contract
rate
and
go
down,
and
then
they'll
have
the
same
problem.
i...
i
mean...
all
right.
but
that's
what
we
want
them
to
do,
is
to
honestly
equate
the
value
of
the
payments
with
the
$4,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
everybody
wants
that,
and
we're
searching...
at
least
i
am...
for
a
way
of
how
to
do
that.
you
keep
telling
me
you
take
contract
rate.
i
hate
to
tell
you
i
keep
thinking
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand.
tell
me
an...
a
question
i
don't
know
the
answer
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when...
when...
if
you
repossess...
if
he
defaults
again...
i
mean,
the
first
time
he
got
into
bankruptcy.
now,
we've
got
the
plan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
suppose
he
doesn't
make
the
payments
on
the
truck.
does
it
then
cost
you
a
lot
of
money
to
go
back
even
though
you
say
to
the
judge,
judge,
this
is
the
second
time?
we'd
like
our
truck
now.
it's
only
worth
$2,000
now.
and
you
still
have
to
pay
the
$75,
get
your
witnesses
and
everything
the
second
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
compensated
for
to
some
extent...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
factor
by
the
fact
they're
using
blue
book
value
to
value
the
car
rather
than
what
it'd
actually
be
worth
in
your
hands
once
you
repossess
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
they're
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
about
then
taking
this
idea?
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how...
we
say,
okay,
we
really
mean
it.
it
has
to
equate
those
two
things.
now,
that
put...
and...
and
then
stop
and
say,
you
can
do
it
with...
i...
i
think,
you
know,
prime
plus
or
whatever,
maybe
the
other.
but...
but
then
put
the
burden
back
on
you
to
produce
some
real
evidence
and
statistics
about
what
happens
to
people
we
don't
know
about.
now,
who
are
those
people?
we
agree
they've
gone
into
bankruptcy,
so
they're
risky,
but
they're
also
trying
to
get
a
second
chance,
and
they
also
want
to
keep
things
like
the
truck
because
it
will
help
them
in
their
business.
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
has
sat
there
and
looked
them
in
the
eye.
and
you
have
all
those
things
about
it
which
you
don't
have
about
the
people
you're
giving
the
21
percent
to
which
is
a
great
mass
of
undifferentiated
people.
so
then
you
have
the
burden
of
trying
to
bear
it
out
with
statistics
and
so
forth
that
these
people
really
are
risky.
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
can't
just
sit
there
and
say,
oh,
i
feel
sorry
for
them.
all
right?
what
about
something
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
that
far.
maybe
you
just
have
to
do
it
in
one
or
two.
but
at
least
we'd
get
to
the
stage
of
people
who
have
trucks
and
use
them
for
a
year
and,
you
know,
at
least
we'd
have
somewhat
better
information
than
just
knowing
about
the
default
rate
in
bankruptcy
cases
in
general.
and
we
get
a
little
finer
than
that.
you
see,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
work
with.
justice
breyer
i
don't
have
an
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
take
the
credit
card
rate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
take
the
credit
card
rate?
why
not
take
his
mortgage
rate?
i
mean,
you
see,
those
aren't
the
right
rates,
are
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
evidence
at
a
different
time
before
you
had
all
the
considerations.
i
mean,
we're
going
in
circles,
and
i
mean,
in
some
respects
it's
good,
in
some
respects
it's
bad.
